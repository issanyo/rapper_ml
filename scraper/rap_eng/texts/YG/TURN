While on top will always have to ( turn around , turn around )
If femmer'n is in his pocket when baosj rolls up ( turn around , turn around )
If your girlfriend is there when she walks by , you kan'kke ( turn around )
But damn for a kæb , then you will ( turn around )
Unless you have the island back in the neck ( turn around )

[ Verse 1: Tshawe ]
I hear guys drinking and running around like a crazy sipper
But the guys after me today and why are they so weird ?
Sku taken you up on my lap and gave you a little lesson
But now it just be a click Klaekken and Blæst sk'dumm
So do not try , I have too many buddies who spazer'em
There is something gærent with them , sometimes just Baeder them
Is it Dameli who ride me out on the prairie ?
It får'u never know me and remember is not honest as, in particular
You 've never had it like that here
Ayo , I hope they never gave up trying , then it just goes gæli
Knocker them out [? ] Before you bite , you were finished
And never forget that I came from two bullet Kaer
You know you're alone but you feel any where so just ( turn [ x4 ] )
It e'kke just wind this, you should ( turn [ x4 ] )
Think fast

[ Hook ]

[ Verse 2: Yosef ]
Okay , time to put the list again
There was not as if we needed it , but fuck it man, it is tempting
Some get pissed and lose the purpose and meaning , hey
But we bury with respect so this here is the weapons chest ( rough)
Time to sweep away some smådritt
I only forty, but has never taken some small steps
( Look at me) nibblers ?
Fuck that low -carb , chewing all the way until the last breath is blown into
Do not got no dew in the neck, but I see a new staircase and the road up
So calling Kaveh , man what 's up?
( Rock , Yosef ? EYH , I m asking about it nicely
May I please borrow Bentley'n for a night? )
You're seventeen , yes, but fuck it , for all are the predicted believe
Puts me back with a beer and chewing popcorn
But I got up and managed by stol'n you I would
For those who never got hit a couple of seconds of silence

[ Hook ]

[ Verse 3: Kaveh ]
Is it me , is it me , is it me some good shit
Veterans afraid of losing your place and say I have good time
I have fakulere and smile while I finger my fans
Those who doubted the music just gets left to Bitches
They used to laugh at me in the hallway, man, There was not readily
Now I get women to turn around, pirouette
Just as you know , do it as if it were a game
We look through the pussy , fucking jellyfish
For a cold wind , not talking about the weather
Turns continue the game back to square the sku ' be
But Madcon , tell me what does the throne out ?
I expected to meet the say I was a little kid
Neck and neck , toys nigga with a couple in me
They back me now, wait until [? ] Then turn the
Fuck it , hi dad , we got mad game
We are independent, still major pay

It's YG 400  hunnid bitch
