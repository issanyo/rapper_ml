[Verse 1: TeeCee4800]
It was me and Marley Blu, young niggas after school
Yeah them niggas playin' ball, we was thinkin' 'bout that loot
35 for an 8 ball, then we split it up
4 gang, [?] gang, yeah we had to double up
[?] started sellin' double, Washington up in the cut
I could never be a broke nigga, pockets got the mumps
You'll always be a broke nigga, always be a bum
Straight bitch, no pun
You be talkin' all that shit and your pockets full of lint
I be fuckin' on your bitch, she say you ain't on your shit
MTM that's the clique, it's the movement, yeah we sick
I'm like how many liccs does it take to get rich, nigga?

[Chorus: TeeCee4800]
I'm like how many liccs does it take to get rich, nigga?
Fast, fast, fast, does it take to get rich, nigga? (Forreal)
I'm like how many liccs does it take to get rich, nigga?
Fast (4 Hunnid) does it take to get rich, nigga?

[Verse 2: YG]
It was me and Buddha, he off a pill, I'm off two
I'm talkin' Spruce St. menace, we was never without the tool
We was 4 block reppin', in the party two steppin'
I had just got put on, it was turnt up in my section
[?] with the extras, we talkin', fuck a [?] shit
She slidin' and I'm slidin', if we catch you then we catch you
If we don't, next day, double back, that's a fact
In my 745, the big ass strap on my lap
Yeah, free Baby Buddha, that's my rider, that's my shooter
Talkin' all that slick talk, man, my nigga down to do ya
That's my troop, boy, that's my troop, boy, that's my mothafuckin' troop
He caught his case, old niggas feel like, "Hallelujah"
Oh Lord, oh Lord
15 bands for the lawyer, what if I was a broke boy?
Oh Lord, oh Lord
He took that 15 to life and now I'm tryna pay my young boy
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like...

[Chorus: TeeCee4800]
I'm like how many liccs does it take to get rich, nigga?
Fast, fast, fast, does it take to get rich, nigga? (Forreal)
I'm like how many liccs does it take to get rich, nigga?
Fast, does it take to get rich, nigga?

[Bridge: TeeCee4800]
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like how many?
How many liccs does it take to get rich, nigga?
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like how many?
Fast, forreal
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like how many?
How many liccs does it take to get rich, nigga?
I'm like, I'm like, I'm like how many?

[Chorus: TeeCee4800]
I'm like how many liccs does it take to get rich, nigga?
Fast, fast, fast, does it take to get rich, nigga? (Forreal)
I'm like how many liccs does it take to get rich, nigga?
Fast, does it take to get rich, nigga?
