[Intro]
Suwoo business on mines, blood, Bompton Inglewood, nigga. This the mothafuckin' Woo mix, on Piru!

[Hook: YG]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 1: Big Wy]
(Woo woo!) Where I'm from you hear that, the wolves come out
Like on Bloods, what's happenin'?
(Woo woo!) Cause when it's on, we're front line
Ain't no bicken, the whole hood get brackin'
I'm from the bottoms where marks get chastised
Before Worldstar, head ups weren't televised
Crack sales with shoe box deposits
Homie lived outside and the cleaners was the closet
Work got swallowed, enemies got knocked off
Give her to the driver have the nigga's top gone
Work, sold for it, young niggas flocked for it
I represent Inglewood and the whole corner pop for it
Enemies all foul, snitch when you bust at 'em
But they the enemy, fuck it, still bust at 'em
Original young gangsters, the ones with the say-so
We bicken back being bool, but on Bloods, we don't play though

[Hook]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
[Verse 2: Mack 10]
It's Mack 10, Blood, what it do
I'm from the 400 block of the Q
I put the Wood on the map, niggas say what they want
But thank me for puttin' the Su in the Woo
And all I think about is money, nigga rollin' in that fast shit
What's the next move, homie, how we get the cash, yeah?
Water in that soft white, get to rockin'
I'm a D-boy, never did no flockin'
Real Inglewood nigga with a real fuckin' attitude
Blood had a 9 but the chopper is a fatter tool
It's who bangin' so we shootin' out of Rovers
And them 223 shells be knockin' shit over
Lay 'em down, spray the whole situation
You with this gangsta shit, throw up your affiliation
I wrote the book and all the rules
I can act a fuckin' fool but I'm bicken back being bool

[Hook]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Do anybody remember the CPD?
Look who outlast 'em, that's that TTP
Arabian spruce, the cranberry's the juice
That we drink with that vodka cause they don't make Super Socco
The first platinum nigga with some big red plaques
Then Mack-10 hit the scene, that nigga had me backed
And I kept pushin', drinkin', smokin' kush and
Puttin' money back in my hood and rollin' bushes
Now who the fuck would say that? Find out where you lay at
Bring it right up to your porch, your home, stay back
Nigga I'm the unofficial mayer, a surreptitious player
And I'll burn my wallet up before I pay her, mothafucka

[Hook]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back, bicken back, bicken back being bool
