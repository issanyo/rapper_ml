[Intro: YG]
(Yeah)
All black four door
If you didn't know by now
(Kitchen's closed)
All black, ah, ah, ah
All black four door
Driving like I'm loco
20 on the dash
I ain’t worried about the popo
It’s YG 400

[Hook: YG]
I got that all black four door
Driving like I'm loco
20 on the dash
I ain’t worried about the popo

[Verse 1: YG]
Give my niggas straps
Tell them where the lick at go go
Before this rap shit, I would have went solo
I don’t give a fuck about no hoe
Aye man YOLO
When I catch your ass nigga Marco Polo
Riding ‘round dolo, give the bitch the low blow
What I mean by that I leave her hanging like a yo-yo
First money boomin, all my hoes tuned in
Get all my homies on, do these drugs to the music
I’m too sick, got homies hitting back on the news clips
Fuck love nigga I’m only shooting at cupid
I’m a pimp, I’m a mac, I’m a cold ass nigga
Got the strap with no stash I’m a bold ass nigga
You a sell out, between another sold ass nigga
You the type to bend over touch your toes ass nigga

[Hook: YG]

[Verse 2: Blanco]
Meet me in the parking lot at the Denny’s
With a quarter mill down to the penny
I be standing there with my semi
Asking me if I got more, said I got plenty
This guerrilla territory, therefore
Can’t afford it, don’t ask for it
(Assholes)  fans took my passport
(Fuck) Fuck the feds kiss my asshole (assholes)
I could show you how to hustle (bitch)
Skinny boy with the muscle (bitch)
I could show you how to duffle (throw money up)
I could show you how to double boy
Smoking joints and the best herb (kush)
Carry guns, but I’m just a nerd (nerd)
Kick back and I just observe (woah)
Dope money is the magic word (woah)
