[Intro: Marc E. Bassy]
LA, you took my love
You made me feel it's never enough
Yeah, Hollywood, you took my heart
You made me tear that shit apart
Yeah, sunset, you took my light
Like you never end, I got no regret
That Westside love, yeah
That Westside, ain't no love over here
Yeah, that Westside love, yeah
Westside, ain't no love over here
Westside love, yeah
That Westside, ain't no love over here

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Say, LA, you took my love
You made me feel it's never enough
Yeah, Hollywood, you took my heart
You made me tear that shit apart
Yeah, that Westside love, yeah
Westside, ain't no love over here
Yeah, that Westside love, yeah
Yeah, that Westside, but it's all love over here, baby

[Verse 1: YG]
Hollywood supposed to motivate you to get your bread up
But Hollywood fuck these bitches head up
'Cause in Hollywood, all these girls models
I'm confused, 'cause they're like pornstars, they all swallow
She got the Celine bag, but drive a Maxima
And my homie smashed, he said that bitch doing bad as fuck
'Cause her priorities ain't priorities
The Weeknd at 1 Oak tonight, that's her priority
Taking my advice, she won't
Tryna tell her 'bout the cons and the pros
Tryna tell her career ain't for show
Tryna tell her roommate a ho
But she already got played on the low
Tryna convince her I'm the BOAT
So stressed, she wanna smoke
Girl, I got shot in L.A I know

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Say, LA, you took my love
You made me feel it's never enough
Yeah, Hollywood, you took my heart
You made me tear that shit apart
Yeah, that Westside love, yeah
Westside, ain't no love over here
Yeah, that Westside love, yeah
Yeah, that Westside, but it's all love over here, baby

[Verse 2: Marc E. Bassy]
Yeah, we in the same lane, we in the drag race
I can't even talk about nothing else besides us
Don't give a fuck about nothing, just passing my lighter
Roll me up something, I'm 'bout to get higher
Light me up something, I'm 'bout to get loose
Pour me some Henny, start speaking the truth
I look in the mirror, didn't know who I was
My black eye was bad, my sober was buzzed
Every time I spoke, you thought I lied
Couldn't tell the truth, had too much pride
Felt caged in by my self-control
Thinking about what the future holds, yeah

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
LA, you took my love
You made me feel it's never enough
Yeah, Hollywood, you took my heart
You made me tear that shit apart

[Bridge: Marc E. Bassy]
Yeah, sunset, you made me feel
Like you never end, I got no regrets
Yeah, that Westside love, yeah
Westside, ain't no love over here

[Chorus: Marc E. Bassy]
Yeah, that Westside love
Yeah, Westside, ain't no love over here
Yeah, Westside love, yeah
Yeah, that Westside, but it's all love over here

[Outro]
Ain't no love over here, no
Ain't no love over here, no, yeah
Who you gonna run to now, baby when the lights go down, yeah
Who you gonna turn to now, baby when the  light go down, yeah
Who gonna drive y'all home, baby, when the club close down
