[Intro: Jay 305]
Stay dangerous
Stay dangerous
Stay dangerous
Stay dangerous

[Verse 1: YG]
They like, "YG, why you so extra'd out?"
'Cause I pull up in a drop, like bitch check me out
I don't drive no Tesla, I got too much clout
Take it out her pussy hole, put it in her mouth
Ooh, they like, "Damn that nigga nasty"
Yeah, fuckin' on a bitch that's classy
Yeah, the dick was good, she harassed me
Yeah, then I nutted on them ass cheeks
2's, 3's, 4's and 5's, eight hunnid, nine hunnid on mine
I commit crimes all the time, I convince my homies to slide
Take this pistol, you down to ride?
Cock the pistol, it's hammer time
Paparazzi, I'm tryna hide
Fuck the bitch, she traumatized
Yeah, just when thinkin' you surpassed me
Yeah, me and Mustard link and we go hammy
Yeah, we both 'bout to cop the Lambies
Yeah, valet the '64 at the Grammys

[Chorus: YG]
Hop in the coupe, subtract the roof like what it do?
Heard you don't like me, well nigga fuck you too
Heard you tryna wife her up, I'm tryna pipe her loose
All my niggas got stripes (rah!), sabertooth
Big Ps, Big Bs, nigga suu whoop
(Brr, brr) Hello? What it Ru?
900 block, back down to the deuce
I'm the man, bitch I walk 'round like I'm bulletproof

[Verse 2: Jay 305]
Ooh, Jay 305, why you extra'd out?
Ooh, pull up to your house to pack your daddy out
Yeah, sexy lil' vegan want it right now
She don't even eat meat, but she gon' eat it now
Ooh, devil on my back and I'm set trippin'
I got stabbed six times, homie my mind different
Stay Dangerous in LA, if you gang affiliated
South Central most hated, watch out
Ooh, Khloe Kardashian in my t-shirt
For you hatin' ass nigga, I know that gotta hurt
Ghetto superstar since I was 16
Now I got a billboard on Crenshaw and King
Yeah, all around the world like Ice Cube
Pimp a bitch, fuck peace in all my interviews
Gettin' rich, fuck a bitch, cracker fuck your rules
Porsche coupe, two bitches, I'm the fuckin' truth

[Chorus: YG]
Hop in the coupe, subtract the roof like what it do?
Heard you don't like me, well nigga fuck you too
Heard you tryna wife her up, I'm tryna pipe her loose
All my niggas got stripes (rah!), sabertooth
Big Ps, Big Bs, nigga suu whoop
(Brr, brr) Hello? What it Ru?
900 block, back down to the deuce
I'm the man, bitch I walk 'round like I'm bulletproof
