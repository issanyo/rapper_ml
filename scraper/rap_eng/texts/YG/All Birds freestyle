[Intro: Rick Ross]
Walk with a real nigga
Self-made millionaire
What more could you ask for, huh?

[Verse 1: Nipsey Hussle]

All blue chucks, with the gold spikes
All black benz with the chrome pipes
Run my own shit, own my own rights
Press my own line got my own stripes
$1,000 luggage on a long flight
See me out in public, bet my arm bright
Million dollar meetings, cause my songs tight
Said he gonna take it, nigga all right
Fake it till you make it, me I ball right
Stack it till my paper is Lebron height
Russian cut diamond cost your car twice
S550 thats the wrong type
600 Benz, with the fog lights
Press the gas, snap your neck like a short bite
Most of these niggas live the fraud life
So most of these bitches is a frauds wife
When you meet a real nigga, play your cards right
Cause when I meet a real bitch I do that broad right
Bet you I'mma leave a mark, like a dog bite
Sellin hot 16's like they off white

[Hook: French Montana]
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds
And I ain't going back -- I'mma ball first

[Verse 2: YG]
Put you in the dirt, with all words
My team straight, all pervs
These hoes dirty nigga, all germs
Listen to Nip, you learn like he spittin all verbs
Bad lil bitch, all curves
Homies like corners, they all turn
Man that big body, nigga all swerves
Bitch before you come to my house, call first
Nigga, do your homework
Gotta take care of home first
You a ho nigga, take a ho bath
I got the strap on me, real niggas hold that
Where the rachets at? Lets get ratchet though
Never trick on them bitches, ain't a magic show
I never trust and I never lust
If it ain't the first night then we never fuck

[Hook: French Montana] x2
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds
And I ain't going back -- I'mma ball first
