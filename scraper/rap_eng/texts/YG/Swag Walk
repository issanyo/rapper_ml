[Hook: Charlie Hood and YG]
See shawty be rocking them things that are lame
And I swear, I swear
If you was my bitch I'd have you sittin' chillin' right here(right here)
Cause yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this
Yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this x3

[Verse 1: Charley Hood]
Now I used to look fly but I really was a broke nigga
Now I got money chilling in my house nigga
Bitches love me they respect my grind
My other bitch tripping though, she ain't worth my time
If you were real bitch you would respect me too
They rather act like a ho and coppa attitude
My kush is kill bill, my swag is so smooth
The paper stack high I can't see the little dudes
And I be on some pimping I put 'em on fig(?)
I bellin'(?) to the set like who got a big
I'm eating her pussy I think I need a bib
Six flat screens all flew out my crib

[Hook]

[Verse 2: YG]
It's YG the lady's man and a Mercedes Benz
Kicks fresh, whip sitting on the latest rims
If you was my bitch I'd have you saying, I'm dating him
Put him on date mood and make you start playing him
I be on some fly shit like all the time, shit
And you would too if you was my bitch
Drop the top of the whip and tell you hop in
Push a button watch it take off like a rocket
He a stopsign(?)-type nigga, so stop it
And be my baby in the cradle and the one I rock with
Like the tag on the Gucci bag get it pop it
Like fuck with me, I give you a profit
How you choose you love like you had other options
Like why you lying to this girl nigga stop frontin'
They talk about they balling that's just gossip
No disease, but fuck with me like I got some

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dubb]
Yo' nigga ain't me he couldn't be me if I taught him
Hold them Gucci bags all them chinchillas I bought them
Splurging in the mall dropping stacks like I have an orange carrot to my chain, attract the bitches like they rabbits
Swag on automatic my whole clique tatter
Walk in chick magnet, the bad bitch bandit
You got the bitch branded, it's all in the game
But I play it like mad, rich like ( )
To the bank laughing, me and YG and my young nigga Charley H. double-O D
Looking for a barbie, pink car in the garage
Her name Nicki so I just wanna Minaj
Dick sucking her profession she do one hell of a job
Hop on me like a boss see who come and take a ride
Aye, baby how you gon' survive after I eat that pussy I'mma eat yo' ass alive

[Hook]
