[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I just sold a whole thang (A whole brick)
Went to [?] I bought a diamond chain (Yeah)
Check the pot, thats how I do my thang (Whip)
Gotta hustle in the dirty game (Jugg, Jugg ok, I'm reloaded)
I got street tides (Yeah), I got street tides (Lets go)
I got street tides, I got street tides (Street tides)
I got street tides, I got street tides (Swamp- Swamp Izzo)

[Verse 1: YG]
Police got them whole thangs
I can shoot, that nino rocks from long range
Girl you want this dick, you getting that whole thang
She tell her whole squad, we ran a soul train (Soul train)
Bitch, I'm YG, 4hunnid, my bitch, get no hundreds
Got bad bitches, they all fuckin'
If not, then they all suckin'
Got big Glocks, y'all all runnin'
Nigga, pop, pop, 'n' y'all all duckin'
Like Donald, nigga, duck
Westside, nigga, we fucked
Bitches in our trucks, I don't talk if she don't fuck
I know niggas with the chickens, but their chickens don't cluck
Money on my mind and my girlfriend trippin'
I'm a ratchet, I like women, pussy wet, then I'm swimmin'
Get that money on-

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
I just sold a whole thang (A whole brick)
Went to [?] I bought two diamond chains (Yeah)

[Chorus: Young Scooter]
