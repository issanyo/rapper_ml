[Intro]
Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot
Nigga Gimmie got shot, hold up
Gimme this, gimme that, gimme a lot
Nigga Gimmie got shot, uh

[Verse 1]
Gimmie wanted a lot
Gimmie wanted some money, Gimmie wanted a Glock
Gimmie wanted a spot at the top but he ain't work for it
Gimmie'll drown in that water without a surfboard
And I'm tired of that gimme shit
Cause my whole life ain't nobody gimme shit
Gimmie getting evicted on the first
And who did Gimme call? Nigga I was the first
Gimmie got handed everything he wanted when he wanted it
If he lost it, he wouldn't know how to recover it
Gimmie gon' fuck around and be a nigga who's homie made it
Out the streets but he was on bullshit so he ain't come with him
Niggas be like "Give me a hand out"
YG be like "Why your grown ass hand out?"
"Uhhh, fucked up my money, uhhh, shit got ugly ma
My baby mama was on me, damn man, we real homies?"

[Verse 2]
Soft early, get Gimmie what Gimmie was asking for
Couple months later, Gimmie start asking for more
Gimmie said he going through it, life hitting, he be starting to lose it
But every time I give him cash, he buys dro, he a doofus
So I say no and Gimmie took it how he took it
I said no for a reason, but he ain't asked, he said said "Fuck me"
And guess what I found out? Nigga what you find out?
Gimmie and my ex bitch was fucking
Ooh, ah, it touched me
Fuck do I press him? Do I pop him? I need advice Father
"Uhh, I thought you ain't love me no more my nigga
I didn't know what to do man, I had to fuck one of your bitches"
See Gimmie all along was a cold nigga
Didn't give him what he wanted so Gimmie stole from niggas
And that's when I pulled out my Glock
Now everybody know how Gimmie got shot
