[Intro]
It's that motherfuckin' gangsta shit, nigga!

[Hook]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back
Bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back
Bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 1]
Pull up on the block, like, "What!"
Fuck the police, niggas better call the SWAT
I ain't never played with the pot
I was in your house tryin' to find a spot to extend my knots
I went to jail for a flock, came home with a strike
You went to jail as a bitch, came home as a dyke
Nigga, yikes! I don't play that shit
Wifey like SEGA; I don't play that bitch
I’m a real Bompton nigga with a motherfuckin' attitude
Walk up in the spot, you would think that a nigga mad at you
I was on the block chillin'; homies, what's the mission?
Came back in a quickness, hoping there wasn't no witness
And they came back shootin'
My homies went back shootin'
Ain’t nobody hittin' nothing, man, this shit getting stupid
And my homies with the news, so they grabbed that tool
This all started from a day of niggas bicken back being bool

[Hook]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back
Bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back
Bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Verse 2]
Verse two, the sun come down
You know when the sun come down them guns come out
Click clack, bow, bow bow bow bow bow
I used to rob niggas
That's probably why they try to rob my style
And karma is a motherfuckin' biatch
You got your homie in jail, you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen, niggas on your wig
Niggas be lurkin', bitches be slurpin'
Niggas got caught up on them Nextels chirpin'
Did some months in the county, I ain't have no patience
My bitch wouldn't come see me, I was in there masturbatin'
Smoking on a bigarette, eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios

[Interlude]
Aye, nigga, nigga, nigga
I got a whole zone right now
Like, right now, right now
Like, what you tryin' to do right now?

[Hook]
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back
Bicken back, bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back
Bicken back, bicken back being bool

[Interlude]
Meanwhile at a home invasion near you
