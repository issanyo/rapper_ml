[Intro: YG]
400

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I take my life way too serious, so don’t play with me
Can’t have that strap in certain states, but it stay with me
It got thirty shots on it like a Curry jersey
Get him hit broad day, call it public service
I'ma give your ass a makeover, them bullets gone take over
Ain’t no game, you can’t play over, white chalk you like Crayola
Comin' from the bottom like me, how you hate on this shit?
I heard they want me dead, you gotta wait on that shit

[Verse 1: Moneybagg Yo]
Let me show you how I’m livin', take you on a tutorial
Smoke a three-five, totin' a thirty, I’m already a Warrior
You want beef, we throw cookouts like the day was Memorial
In LA, she overseas, I flew her in through LaGuardia
I’m worth too much, no fighting
Whole lotta bread, still viking
Kel-Tech or a Glock-19, get hit, sprayed up like Creed
Don’t think just 'cause I rap, all that cap gon' get you clapped
Nigga you not from the streets, might get lost, need Google Maps
I’m back on that gang shit again, we goin' 400 Federal
I won’t get a plain wrist again, eat up the drip like an edible (Medicine)
DrumGod on the beat, a lot of money stackin' neat (6'3")
Last second buzzer beater, alley-hoop to YG

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo & YG]
I take my life way too serious, so don’t play with me
Can’t have that strap in certain states, but it stay with me
It got thirty shots on it like a Curry jersey
Get him hit broad day, call it public service
I'ma give your ass a makeover, them bullets gone take over
Ain’t no game, you can’t play over, white chalk you like Crayola
Comin' from the bottom like me, how you hate on this shit?
I heard they want me dead, you gotta wait on that shit (400)

[Verse 2: YG]
Wait, wait, wait, wait
Deuce deuce deuce, five forty, Glock, K
Brand new Jeep Wag', with no license plates
Incognito, hundred percent my tint rate
I’m striped out the game, I got the Glock on me bitch
I’m out on bail, I’m feelin like 2Pac in this bitch
If Psych see an opp, then bodies might drop in this bitch
It's my life or your life and you ain’t stopping me bitch
"YG put the gun down, have security around"
You the type to sound like you have the police around
I take my life too serious, I never slip out of bounds
When YG come in town all the suwoops come out

[Chorus: Moneybagg Yo]
I take my life way too serious, so don’t play with me
Can’t have that strap in certain states, but it stay with me
It got thirty shots on it like a Curry jersey
Get him hit broad day, call it public service
I'ma give your ass a makeover, them bullets gone take over
Ain’t no game, you can’t play over, white chalk you like Crayola
Comin' from the bottom like me, how you hate on this shit?
I heard they want me dead, you gotta wait on that shit
