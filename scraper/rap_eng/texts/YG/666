[Intro: YG]
Uh

[Verse 1: YG]
Stars in the roof, sittin' in the Wraith
Got it all off these bars, man, this shit kinda crazy
I been out wildin' with these young niggas lately
Fuckin' all the pretty bitches, man, this shit kinda crazy
I'm blessed so itâ€™s brazy, lifestyle too much for ladies
I been on some player shit, hoops my nigga don't make
You is not the reason I'm pullin' up in the latest
Westside nigga, ho, I don't need no favors

[Pre-Chorus: YG]
Ayy, damn this beat got bass
Everything that's bad for me right here in my face
I been on the fo' block, I been on the A
Gun up on my waist like I'm tryna catch a case

[Chorus: YG & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Move bitch, a nigga need a little space
Stank look on my face, that's too much drugs and drank
Bein' haunted  'bout my past, someone help me get away, damn
What you think I do? I buy more drugs and drank
Move bitch, a nigga need a little space (uh-huh)
Don't tell me I'ma be okay 'cause this shit not okay (uh-uh)
Give a fuck 'bout what you think bitch, fuck what you think (fuck you bitch)
But don't come judgin' me 'cause I had too much drugs and drank

[Verse 2: YG & YoungBoy Never Broke Again / Both]
I ain't in the mood bitch, don't come inside my gate
That's trepassin' you bastard, I can shoot you in your face
If I run past you, my bad, my whole life feel like it's a maze
Been drinkin' my life away, they can't stop me, I go crazy
Drunk drivin' in that G-Wagon, they tell me it ain't safe
But I'm drunk drivin' that G-Wagon
Get your square ass out my face
The homie just got a Wraith (Wraith)
Po-Po brought him my name (name)
They know we from the gang, this shit out my range
This shit out my fuckin' range bitch
I ain't plannin' on a change bitch
I'm goin' through a field of pain bitch
4Hunnid gang, click-clack, bang bitch
I'm haunted by these demons, yeah, I see 'em walk (walk)
So you know I got the devil in my thoughts (thoughts)
I be seein' the devil in my living room hall (hall)
I just hope I ain't got the devil in my little Heart (this shit for real)

[Pre-Chorus: YG]
Ayy, damn this beat got bass
Everything that's bad for me right here in my face
I been on the fo' block, I been on the A
Gun up on my waist like I'm tryna catch a case

[Chorus: YG & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Move bitch, a nigga need a little space
Stank look on my face, that's too much drugs and drank
Bein' haunted  'bout my past, someone help me get away, damn
What you think I do? I buy more drugs and drank
Move bitch, a nigga need a little space
Don't tell me I'ma be okay 'cause this shit not okay
Give a fuck 'bout what you think bitch, fuck what you think
But don't come judgin' me 'cause I had too much drugs and drank

[Verse 3: YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
(And I'll pull up)
And I'll pull up with a hundred in each pocket bitch (skrrt)
Fresh up out the slammer, that lil' nigga on some cocky shit
Play me like a jit and you get hit up
You ain't stoppin' shit (grrah, rrah)
Tell me when to pull up
Make the train ride in the lobby bitch (all in the lobby)
Move bitch, get shot up in your face (bitch)
Niggas 'round me hate, tryna figure what I made (damn)
Can't make it to my house if I don't buzz you at the gate (beep)
Secure 'bout my gang, bitch I gotta play it safe
Plenty racks off in the safe, shit (racks)
Check it, you get mate, bitch
Five, that's my Blood blatt, strictly that 4L shit
Quick, a shooter 12 shit, without the dope, young nigga rich
Challenged at your own risk
I up and bust your dome bitch (boo-bow)

[Pre-Chorus: YG]
Ayy, damn this beat got bass
Everything that's bad for me right here in my face
I been on the fo' block, I been on the A
Gun up on my waist like I'm tryna catch a case

[Chorus: YG & YoungBoy Never Broke Again]
Move bitch, a nigga need a little space
Stank look on my face, that's too much drugs and drank
Bein' haunted  'bout my past, someone help me get away, damn
What you think I do? I buy more drugs and drank
Move bitch, a nigga need a little space
Don't tell me I'ma be okay 'cause this shit not okay
Give a fuck 'bout what you think bitch, fuck what you think
But don't come judgin' me 'cause I had too much drugs and drank

[Outro: Albert "Alchemist" Thompson]
Lord, help me Lord. These kids Lord, they playing with all these guns and drugs, they remind me when I was young. See, in the 80s, we didn't play that shit. But we was crack babies. No Lord, I'm not no hypocrite, I'm just an old motherfucker, tryna save some shit. Lord, I ask my son "Why it is just thugs he hang out with?" He looked at me and said "Pops, I'm staying dangerous." Help me Lord, I tried to tell him there are many ways to stay dangerous. Power is dangerous, knowledge is dangerous, having them dollars is dangerous. He just looked at me Lord and said "Pops, I'm talking dangerous."
