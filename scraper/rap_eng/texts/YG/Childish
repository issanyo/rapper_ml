Why you mad, cause I'm rich?
Or you mad cause I might be fuckin' yo' bitch? (*Nigga*)
It ain't my fault that you love that bitch (*Nigga*)
It ain't my fault that she love my dick (*Nigga*)
Why you trippin' on me, that's childish
Why you trippin' on me, that's childish
Why you trippin' on me, that's childish
Why you trippin' on me, that's childish

[Verse 1: BoBo Norco]
I cut class for the red Giuseppes
Tryna double up like the price is right
Then I whipped up the raw for the Mulsanne Bentley
Dropped a bootleg like a rodeo night
Your boy got the bitches in a bidding frenzy
They boyfriends act like Miami Vice
I got more knocks than a Jehovah's witness
And I keep it more lit than the Church of Christ
First things first, imma mack regardless
This french ros√© got me acting heartless
They throwin' shade but I disregard it
I'm way too smooth to be catching charges
I picked her up in the Aston Martin
Dropped her off in a black Delorean
Spritz Clive Chris on my Mason Martin
Cause your bitch smell just like the Asian market

(Verse 2: YG)
I know you heard me on the radio (True)
I know you hear me everywhere you go (True)
Your girlfriend game me all yo' attention
Aw damn, that's some shit I shouldn't mention (uh-oh)
I do shows, I got dough, I got freaks
I got a - sex tape that might leak
If I don't - fuck with you we got beef
Thats why I move how I move in these streets
His bitch on my dick so he checked her
He don't know we go back like Sean John and Mecca
He searchin' through a phone he's a presser
Found out his bitch a late night texter
He's trippin', cause she's wildin'
But she grown, he act childish
All those trips she was taking a pirate
She ain't had no money, now she understand it

[Verse 3: BoBo Norco]
I'm dipped off lean, OG, and Bombay
Bitches get fucked like I'm Rico Suave
Blunts get wrapped like a RICO statute
I spit like Pac at the Paparazzi
I'm a problem, my label refuse to drop me
The club like a coop and the pigeons flock me
Revenge of the hood, nerds tryna stop me
Middle finger pig, that's enough to block me
Got a gold lucky charm like a Mayan
It look like I hit a lick on a pirate
Dope dick will leave a drip in your sinus
My video will leave your phone with a virus
One night stand, that's the shit my clique's on
My dick's in her mouth and I tell her to get gone
Babysit the kids while a fuck the kid's mom
In love cause I'm rich and she knows the dick's bomb
