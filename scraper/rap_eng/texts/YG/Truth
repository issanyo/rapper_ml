[Verse 1:]
Aye, did I pass or fail?
Graduate or go to jail?
Who writes the test?
Who define's success?
We all wanna win, play ball or rap
But when that don't happen, it ain't no going back
You drop out too young, now you just busting caps
Call it blue on red but it's really black on black
Cause the more we drop out, the more we go to jail
Like voluntary slaves, expected to fail
Listen up brother, you need to understand
Being truly educated ain't a part of their plan
We got tricked again and slicked again
Held back and not picked again
Short-changed and then chipped again, been slipped again

[Hook:]
The truth been flipped again and ripped again
The truth been flipped again and ripped again
The truth been flipped again and ripped again
Life's the test, keep the rest, we want
Life's the test, keep the rest, we want
Life's the test, keep the rest, we want success, so do your best

[Verse 2:]
If money's the only goal then we all gone fail
If greed is a crime then we'd all go to jail
If love is the answer why don't it pay the rent?
If patience is a virtue why's it all spent?
If religion is the way then why we all fighting?
If mankind gone survive why we ain't united?
If the truth will set you free then we still lying?
Big criminals get up but the baby's still crying
If karma was real why don't we expect it?
If the earth is our mother then why neglect it?
We got tricked again and slicked again
Held back and not picked again
Short-changed and then chipped again, been slipped again

[Hook 3x:]
The truth been flipped again and ripped again
The truth been flipped again and ripped again
The truth been flipped again and ripped again
Life's the test, keep the rest, we want
Life's the test, keep the rest, we want
Life's the test, keep the rest, we want success, so do your best

[Verse 1:]
Did I pass or fail?
Graduate or go to jail?
Who writes the test
Who define success
We all wanna win, play ball or rap
But when that don't happen, it ain't no going back
You drop out too young, now you just busting caps
Call it blue on red but it's really black on black
Listen up brother, you need to understand
Being truly educated ain't a part of their plan
We got tricked again and slicked again
Held back and not picked again
The truth been flipped again and ripped again
