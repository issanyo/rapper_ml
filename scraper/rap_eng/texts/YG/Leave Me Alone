[Verse 1]
Baby why'd you leave me alone
I thought we was in love until you let me go
Put me on the boat and sent me to the coast
I missed them nights when I used to pipe, yeah, these strokes
And I even used to fucking ball like a freethrow
Every friday our bedroom was like a freak show
Thought I was your nigga for life, your hero
(That shit got old) That's the worst that she spoke
But that's fucked up, the homies told me don't trip
But I'm not gon trip when I lost my bitch
Feeling like R. Kelly, I wish I wish
And no I ain't gon cry but I miss my bitch
I miss my baby girl but I don't know her anymore
You gon do me like this, I guess this a cold world
This a dog eat dog world and the dogs chase the cats
Fuck thought this shit coming back, no

[Hook]
Baby why you leave me
Baby why you leave me alone
Baby why we don't talk no more
I used to be your neezy
Yo' nigga fa'sho
I used to be but I'm not no more
Baby why you do me wrong
Baby why you leave me x3
Baby why you do me wrong

[Verse 2]
Baby why you leave me, you did it so easy
I tried to tell my mama, but my mama didn't believe me
This shit is off the heezy, a nigga misses breezy
I missed the freaky things she used to do just to please me
Piddy Pablo, I had her frequently
She up and on faster than a GT
Just wish I could make things rewind
Cause I'd rewind when she left me like the spring time
I be fine, everybody knows that's a lie
Rockabye baby, rockabye baby
I think I need to go to rehab, I'm going crazy
I did everything you wanted me to when you played me
And you know what's some fucked up shit
I ain't even with another chick, damn

[Hook]
Baby why you leave me
Baby why you leave me alone
Baby why we don't talk no more
I used to be your neezy
Yo' nigga fa'sho
I used to be but I'm not no more
Baby why you do me wrong
Baby why you leave me x3
Baby why you do me wrong

[Verse 3]
Since the day you left, I can't rest
I been at the house by myself depressed
Riding around the streets by myself
Tryna find somebody cause I really need help
So baby come back, baby come back, baby come back, baby come back
Tell me what's the issue, girl I really miss you
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna kiss you

[Hook]
Baby why you leave me
Baby why you leave me alone
Baby why we don't talk no more
I used to be your neezy
Yo' nigga fa'sho
I used to be but I'm not no more
Baby why you do me wrong
Baby why you leave me x3
Baby why you do me wrong
