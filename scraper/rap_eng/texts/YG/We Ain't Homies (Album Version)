[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Fuck the topic
Why you on it?
Stop that acting like you know me
Talking 'bout my old friends like we homies
I get it how I live it
They don't know me
Talking 'bout some old shit like you know me
Like you know me
Nigga, you don't know me
Talking 'bout my old bitch like you know me
You don't know me
Nigga we ain't homies, no no

[Post-Chorus: Arin Ray]
Damn
Are you for real, real, real, real, real?
See what's the deal, deal, deal? Wait

[Verse 1: Arin Ray]
See you need to back up, back up
Give me space, I need to stack up
Get my racks up
You a non-fucking factor
I done passed ya
I done came a long way since The X Factor, hey
Damn
Where were you when we was broke?
Eatin' ramen noodles from the corner store
I ain't even see you when shit was low
So, don't you try to act like you really know

[Pre-Chorus: Arin Ray]
I mean for real, real, real, real, real
Hey, what's the deal, deal, deal, deal?

[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Fuck the topic
Why you on it?
Stop that acting like you know me
Talking 'bout my old friends like we homies
I get it how I live it
They don't know me
Talking 'bout some old shit like you know me
Like you know me
Nigga, you don't know me
Talking 'bout my old bitch like you know me
You don't know me
Nigga we ain't homies, no no

[Verse 2: YG]
(Wussup)
Wussup with these clown ass niggas
Got the bag so you tryna come around ass nigga
Tryna show me that you down ass nigga
Only thing down my ten toes to the ground my nigga
You watch too much TMZ
You Google my net worth
You heard some shit from a chick I smashed, you believe her
You mad 'cause you played the background like reverb
You front row hatin’, wearing YG t-shirt
Don’t do me like that
You don’t know me like that
I got on, I did my shit
I don’t owe you like that, ey
Put 4hunnid on the map, ey
You ain't got notin’ to do wit’ that, ey
This is ain't no rap I made up this shit facts, ey, ey
I’m for sho' poppin’
I’m for sho' poppin’
They want to be my friends now that’s how you know I’m poppin’
I'm for sho' poppin’
I’m for sho' poppin’
I got white friends now that’s how you know I’m poppin’

[Verse 3: Arin Ray]
You read about it
Don't run your mouth (4hunnid)
And you don't know what you're talking 'bout
You don't know what I'm all about
You, you ain't see how it all went down, down, no
I'm interested, what's your motivation? (Your motivation?)
You say you know me, but got no relation (Got no relation)
Your Instagram got you feeling famous
Could give a damn 'bout your confirmation

[Chorus: Arin Ray]
Fuck the topic
Why you on it?
Stop that acting like you know me
Talking 'bout my old friends like we homies
I get it how I live it
They don't know me
Talking 'bout some old shit like you know me
Like you know me
Nigga, you don't know me
Talking 'bout my old bitch like you know me
You don't know me
Nigga we ain't homies, no no

[Outro: Arin Ray]
Are you for real, real, real, real, real, real, real?
See what's the deal, deal, deal?
