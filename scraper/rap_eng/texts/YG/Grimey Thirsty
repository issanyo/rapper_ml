Grimey, thirsty, grimey

Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on

[Verse 1: Kev Nish]

Dirty dog out the club
Street pocket accurate
Two socks, house slippers
40 ounce malt liquor
Gimme, gimme ham no burger
Fuck a bitch on a rag, holler more murder
Hit it like a mother catch your face butter
Hit you with the lights off, CD wonder
Let me hit it, let me hit it yo
Let me hit it, let me hit it yo
Let me hit it, let me hit it yo
Pound it, pound it, pound it
Pound it, pound it, pound it

[Hook]

Grimey, thirsty, grimey
Grimey, grimey, thirsty
Grimey, grimey, thirsty, grimey, thirsty, grimey thirsty
Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on

[Verse 2: YG]

Police pulled me over, driving all black
Search the car for an hour tryna find the strap
If I catch one shipment, promise I'ma do it
Like children in the 90s, promise I'ma do 'em
Cop 'em with the shot, beat them with the bat
Tell 'em fuck the police and take his badge
Put the molly in the bucket, over oho
Far East Movement, got my Chucks on
Pound it, pound it, pound it
Let me hit it, let me hit it yo
Pound it, pound it, pound it
Let me hit it, let me hit it yo
Pound it, pound it, pound it

[Hook]

Grimey, thirsty, grimey
Grimey, grimey, thirsty
Grimey, grimey, thirsty, grimey, thirsty, grimey thirsty
Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on
Get on, get on, get on, get on

[Verse 3: Prohgress]

All dirty, hit me up
Groupie let me hit her up
White T's in the V.I.P
Pictures toll booth have the poetry
A.Z. and cat gang
With your hash tag and everything
Freit cast Louie bag [?] thirsty bitches get the timberlands
Hit 'em with the jack move
Pound it, pound it, pound it
Hit 'em with the jack move
Pound it, pound it, pound it

[Outro]

Grimey, thirsty, grimey
Grimey, grimey, thirsty
Grimey, grimey, thirsty, grimey, thirsty, grimey thirsty
