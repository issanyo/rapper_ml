[Verse 1: YG]
It's YG 400
Say she want a balla'
Mustard on the beat ho

She say she want a baller
Fuck once, and never ever call her
She asked why, "Bitch I grew up on the Carter"
Tryna get head 'til I bust like the chancellor
Uh, I got her thinking she gone meet Moms
I started this Mac shit nigga Steve Jobs
Yeehaw in a Porsche
Hit the block then I pull up on the porch
Where they do that at?
Smoke a big ass Philly, you gotta light it with a torch
We young niggas smoking that (400!)
He say he the truth but he really not
Cause the summer only time he hot
Yeah, all my niggas savages
And we do these hoes so scandalous
(Quez: Nine times outta ten!)
That mean we the only ones left
Nigga think different then he's getting pressed
On the set, nigga

[Hook: Quez]
Nine times outta ten
Me and all my niggas known to win
Catch me whipping in a Beamer or a Benz
Nine times outta ten
Catch me with a bad yellow bitch with a twin
And a dark skinned friend
Nine times outta ten
I'ma make her do a back bend
We gone be up in this bitch until it ends
Nine times outta ten
All my niggas keep something rolled up
You wasn't smoking 'til we showed up, nigga

[Verse 2: Strap]
From ATL to Hollywood
Got them hoes on molly and they rolling good
Nine times outta ten I'm rocking eight, chains
I'ma big dog I'ma great, dane
Hopping out the Beamer, partner in the 'Rari
Thick bitch named Keyshia shaking at Follie's
And your bitch with me half naked in the lobby
We go up to the room I blow smoke on her body
I walk it like I talk it
Play it how I see it
Throw the money up and fall down on the head
Nine times outta ten kush in the wind
Nine times outta ten F's on the rim
Fuck- f-f-f Fuck 'em all
50,000 in the rubberband thats how we ball
Drop head motherfucker that's the ladies
Ball hard on a ho like I'm Baby

[Hook: Quez]
Nine times outta ten
Me and all my niggas known to win
Catch me whipping in a Beamer or a Benz
Nine times outta ten
Catch me with a bad yellow bitch with a twin
And a dark skinned friend
Nine times outta ten
I'ma make her do a back bend
We gone be up in this bitch until it ends
Nine times outta ten
All my niggas keep something rolled up
You wasn't smoking 'til we showed up, nigga

[Verse 3: Ali]
My life is amazing oh yeah it's picture perfect
Young fly nigga hopping out of driver service
Young rich nigga counting up a couple G's
I'm never alone keep me a couple freaks
Then after the strip club have a threeway
Fuck it I ain't had a haircut in ten days
Nine times outta ten I'm grindin'
Ten outta ten I'm shinin'
Nine times outta ten
I'm probably pulling up in a Benz
If I fucked her then I probably fucked her friend
Nine times outta ten
These niggas out here know how we do it
Cause when we do it, we do it, we never show how we do it
I count a hundred in cash, I get my money real fast
Niggas be tryna catch up, they say I'm talking too fast
Say I got too many hoes, say we got too many shows
Yeah she in love with the swag but they in love with the flow

[Hook: Quez]
Nine times outta ten
Me and all my niggas known to win
Catch me whipping in a Beamer or a Benz
Nine times outta ten
Catch me with a bad yellow bitch with a twin
And a dark skinned friend
Nine times outta ten
I'ma make her do a back bend
We gone be up in this bitch until it ends
Nine times outta ten
All my niggas keep something rolled up
You wasn't smoking 'til we showed up, nigga

[Verse 3: Quez]
Nine times outta ten getting faded
If I'm getting faded then I'm probably with your lady
Five times outta five she getting fucked up
If I ain't hit her, know my homie fucked up
Big ole' booty, face on cutie
Nine times outta ten she starrin' in a movie
Layin in the bed butt naked in the Luby's
Started right here then we ended in the 'cuzzi
God damn, (God damn)
Nine times outta ten bet your bitch know who I am (I am)
Hold up, you wasn't smoking til we showed up pussy nigga

Slide through with the doors up pussy nigga
Black Boe two iced out double B's
