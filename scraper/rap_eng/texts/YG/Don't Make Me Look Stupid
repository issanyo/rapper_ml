[Intro: DJ Mustard]
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Hook: RJMrLA]
Said she don't wanna be no dumb bitch (no lie, no lie)
Don't have me lookin' like no dumb bitch (girl, I won't)
Said she don't wanna be no dumb bitch (no lie, no lie)
Don't have me lookin' like no dumb bitch
She don't wanna look stupid
Said she don't wanna be no dumb bitch (no lie, no lie)
Don't have me lookin' like no dumb bitch (girl, I won't)
Said she don't wanna be no dumb bitch (no lie, no lie)
Don't have me lookin' like no dumb bitch
She don't wanna look stupid

[Verse 1: RJMrLA]
She don't wanna get played
No, she don't wanna get played
What the number 1 rule is?
Let me know and be straight
And don't be lyin' to my face
Know you got a lot of groupies
Seen 'em all on your page
Don't let me catch 'em backstage
Yea, you want me exclusive
Cause loyalty go long ways
But loyaly go both ways
Let me know you ain't the same

[Hook: RJMrLA]
Said she don't wanna be no dumb bitch (no lie, no lie)

[Verse 2: RJMrLA]
Takin' pictures 'round your friends
Then takin' me around your friends tryna have me look goofy
How you treatin' us the same?
I just think that shit lame
Just don't have me look stupid
I can ride for the cause
You know, I love your dirty drawers
I just want you exclusive
Loyalty go long ways
But loyalty go both ways
Let me know I ain't the same

[Verse 3: YG]
She don't wanna be no side bitch
She forever thotty
Lookin' in her eyes when she rides me
Tell her, "you on top, you ain't no side bitch"
If I ain't hit you from the side, you ain't no side bitch
Don't wanna look like a thotty
She don't wanna look thotty
Cause everybody thinks YG a thotty
I hate baby girl blockhead
Cause she gave the whole block head
She wanna feel special
She tells me, "buy me something special"
She tells me, "take us somewhere special"
This little bitch a handful
When they know you got a footlong
They tryna make you do the extra long
They make you go extra hard
Makes you gas and don't call
Shoppin' sprees at the mall to make 'em feel like your broad
Cancun and Cabo trips, all types of extra shit
You done spent a $100,000 on this side bitch, yea
