[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
I can't trust these bitches
No, No-No-No, No, No-No-No, No, No
I can't trust these pussy ass niggas
No-No-No, No, No-No-No, No, No
I can't trust these bitches
No, No-No-No, No-No-No, No, No
I can't trust these pussy ass niggas
No-No-No, No, No-No-No, No

[Verse 1: O.T. Genasis]
First thing first I can't trust none of these niggas
Act like they're your partner but they really in they feelings
Tell they ass a secret they gon' tell somebody else
Bout to grab that Glock 17 right off the shelf
Think I ain't gon' pull it, now he seeing bullets
Strapped up with that hoodie, motherfucking bully
Lying to your homie man I thought I was your homie?
But your ass is phony
I'm cool by my lonely
I don't need no friends
All I need is bands
All I need is grams
Sitting in the pan
Went to Ben Baller just to see the Rollie dance
Racks looking like I got another pair of pants

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
I can't trust these bitches
No, No-No-No, No, No-No-No, No, No
I can't trust these pussy ass niggas
No-No-No, No, No-No-No, No, No
I can't trust these bitches
No, No-No-No, No-No-No, No, No
I can't trust these pussy ass niggas
No-No-No, No, No-No-No, No

[Verse 2: YG]
I got trust issues
My resume more gangster than your gangster then I can't fuck with you
I got trust issues
Your quarterback always getting sacked
Your play incomplete your connect don't fuck with you
I can't hustle with you
Cause my money looking funny
Me and my niggahs gon' rumble with you
Girl wassup with you?
If your make up, caked up and weave stink I can't fuck with you
Damn they talk behind my back
Borrow all my straps
I just showed 'em, love
Fronted work and gave up racks
This song come with the [?]
Like currency grabbing some money stacks
My past is full of facts
Why O.T. wrote this hook like that

[Hook: O.T. Genasis]
I can't trust these bitches
No, No-No-No, No, No-No-No, No, No
I can't trust these pussy ass niggas
No-No-No, No, No-No-No, No, No
I can't trust these bitches
No, No-No-No, No-No-No, No, No
I can't trust these pussy ass niggas
No-No-No, No, No-No-No
