(Bridge: Taz Focal)
All this heartache  I’m feeling
I swear so hard not to cry
Sometimes I’m too weak for this living
I promise my momma I’d try
It feel like I’m living a lie
I know that I’m living a lie
It feel like I’m living a lie
I know that I’m living a lie

(Chorus: Yung2Brown)
You made it so hard to survive
They made it too hard to survive
I gave my all to this shit
For all that my G’s that died (repeat)
