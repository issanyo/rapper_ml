[Intro]

[Hook]
You look good how you doin'
What's your name girl what's poppin'?
I respect your hustle girl I can't knock it
She asked the lord why she livin'
Cause it ain't making no sense
She out here sellin' sex, trynna pay the rent
You look good how you doin'
What's your name girl what's poppin'?
I respect your hustle girl I can't knock it
She asked the lord why she livin'
Cause it ain't making no sense
She out here sellin' sex, trynna pay the rent


[Verse 1]
Now sex, pay the rent
But see her parents don't even know that
She been through alot
But the way she look don't even show that
She used to strip but everybody know her
So she don't wanna go back
And sadly her baby daddy , did her dirty like the flo mat
She be happy to pay the taxi and take her where that dough at
She stressing from confession
She like Keisha where that dro at ?
She think conversating with people
'Bout her problems is so whack
And she dont fuck with them bitches
She think them bitches is toe back
She think the devil is a friend cause the way she been livin'
For the right price,  she'll give you that sexual healing
Sexual feeling, sex and joke, let's get more powder and sniff it
Yup now she trippin'
Her mother don't love her so her mind in the gutter
And her big brother got 20 years for murder
She did been through it all
Nothing more could hurt her
But I respect her struggle so this what I told her


[Hook]
You look good how you doin'

[Verse 2]
3 year old daughter and her daddy's not involved
She say her fraud he don't send no money he don't call
So she gotta go extra' hard, extra' hard
She got 7 niggas's numbers
When she got home she text them all
She like what bitch, get hit nigga get the fuck back
When it comes to letting her baby down, she like "fuck that"
She lives in the ghetto, she always wearin' stilettos
She try to live by the bible but she get chased by the devil
She fuck a nigga, suck a nigga for no less than 3 hunnids
Thinking 'bout her daughter, prolly got her sick to her stomach
And that's when she fuck it, her mind she finna lose it
Fcking , all these niggas she out here feeling stupid
All these problems with no one answer them
All these situations with no one to manage them
Then she was finna put the Glock to her head
Till she met a real nigga and he said


[Hook]
You look good how you doin'

Cause it ain't making no sense
She out here sellin' sex, trynna pay the rent
