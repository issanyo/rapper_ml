[Intro: Raw Smooth]
Raw Smooth with a banger now

[Hook: Raw Smooth]
Don't trip (don't trip, don't trip)
I be on my way
Over to your crib so we
Can do that thang
Show you what it is
Oh you got it girl you can get the biz
And I'm gon beat that pussy like wow
Cause I'm in love with yo pussy girl
Cause I'm in love with yo pussy girl

Cause I'm in love with yo pussy girl
No I ain't in love with you
I'm in love with yo pussy

[Verse 1: YG]
I'm in love with it
I'm in love with it
After I wear it out I'm in the tub with it
Have fun with it make that pussy talk right
Coversating about sex we could
Talk that
My shoes Gucci and her bags Chanel
Her friends fake but her ass is real
When she let a nigga hit I'm a smash her real like
Yeah, fo real fo real ugh
Since she bout it, I'm tryin to take it
That juice ain't the only thing naked
Fuck with me girl just because
The dick good and I'm a blood

[Hook]

[Verse 2: John Heart]
I put the peace sign up in my tongue between
All I need is one minute have that pussy creamin
I lay pipe like the roto boys
Dick long like a well she call me polo boy
I be murderin the pussy nigga R.I.P
I'm knee deep in her she screamin OMG
So don't trip I be on my way to the crib
I be the sucka you can be the kid
I don't really eat pussy
But tonight I'm deep divin in that pussy
I'm like turn around touch the ground
Good, bend over make that ass clap

[Bridge: Raw Smooth]

I love the way it stay leakin when I'm in that thang

[Hook]
