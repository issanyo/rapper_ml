[Chorus]
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Go on, fuck it up, girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Go on, fuck it up, girl, go on, fuck it up, girl

[Verse 1]
Ayy, bring that back
Break it out, girl, lose that fake
Got a name tatted on you , girl, who dat there?
Heard you talkin' that shit, girl, is you 'bout that?
You're with your girlfriends, I'm with my niggas
I know we drunk talking shit, but that's my nigga
That tequila in my liver
She don't give it up the first time, then I give her
Fuck it up

[Chorus]
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Go on, fuck it up, girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Go on, fuck it up, girl, go on, fuck it up, girl

[Verse 2]
Fuck it up, run it up, that's on us
Skinny thang, big ass, that's a plus
I hit a bad bitch with no condom on (Ooh)
In God we trust, that's a must
I tryna get it, not get by
Pay the rent for a hottie with some thick thighs
She don't ask for nothin' but a good time (Yeah)
And that pussy good, I'ma at home by midnight
Got your own top, you don't need no nigga
You're dressed like it's summertime when it's winter (When it's winter)
Fifty inch weave but you bought it so it's yours head
Drop it to the floor, girl, drop it to the floor (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Go on, fuck it up, girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Go on, fuck it up, girl, go on, fuck it up, girl

[Bridge]
You're with your girlfriends, I'm with my niggas
I know we drunk talking shit, but that's my nigga
That tequila in my system
She don't give it up the first time, then I give her
You're dressed like it's summertime when it's winter
Fifty inch weave but you bought it so it's yours head
Drop it to the floor, girl, drop it to the floor (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Go on, fuck it up, girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Fuck it up girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
Go on, fuck it up, girl, go on, fuck it up, girl
