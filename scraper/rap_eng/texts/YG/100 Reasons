[Intro: DJ Carisma]
Carisma
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Chorus: YG & (DJ Carisma)]
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
Can't no other nigga get it hotter than me, girl
From the back, I show you how I fuck you, girl
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck (young legend)
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
Give it to you thorough in the middle
Told 'em we should count, you could call a nigga shizzle, huh

[Verse 1: YG]
Okay, okay, excuse my freak ways
Hopin' you not with the games like EA
Spray you a little, tell that ass to behave
She ain't the type that gotta be told, bitch shave
She the type to have ass since the sixth grade
No answer for you lames, NA
Ain't up for discussion, back to the fuckin'
If I pull my dick out, she get to fuckin' and suckin'
Ha, know that she, know that she, know that she
Know that she, know that she don't do
See I don't know what them hoes told you
But my dick good like soul food

[Chorus: YG & Jeremih]
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
Can't no other nigga get it hotter than me, girl (yeah, yeah)
From the back, I show you how I fuck you, girl (yeah)
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck (100 reasons why we should fuck)
Give it to you thorough in the middle
Told 'em we should count, you could call a nigga shizzle, huh

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
Where your friends at? They all wanna go
Where your man at? You don't even know
We should get away, we can lose control
I just drop the top, you should lose your clothes
I would take you shoppin', but you look better without it
Better without 'em, don't you step here without 'em
You're a hot topic, when you ain't even round me
Got a 100 reasons, baby, if you allow 'em
I don't even gotta sneak with you
I ain't gotta wake up, I just be with you
All I know, at the end I just see with you
Don't let them haters hate when they see me with you
Ride steady, I'm ready
And no I'm not into no teasing
You can hit me up
Baby, if you need some more reasons

[Chorus: YG & Jeremih]
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
Can't no other nigga get it hotter than me, girl (yeah, yeah)
From the back, I show you how I fuck you, girl (yeah)
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck (100 reasons why we should fuck)
Give it to you thorough in the middle
Told 'em we should count, you could call a nigga shizzle, huh

[Verse 3: YG]
See I'ma give it to you straight like this
If I ain't got shit, girl, I got dick
Yeah, you fuckin' with a young nigga
If I wasn't rappin', bitch, I'd be a drug dealer
Fuck me, I make you cum quick
Plus she give a nigga head like a dumb nigga
Like lick it, lick it, lick it, lick it
Hit it up then quit it in time for diddy
Why your nigga try to make you happy?
I'll be there when you call me, try to make it nasty
No hickies, just a quickie, girl, I make it snappy
Leave my bitch for you, girl, don't put it past me
Back seat or at the crib though?
Can't get you pregnant so I bust on the window
Ooh, yeah, I'm nasty, prolly on my high school
'Cause she didn't pass me

[Chorus: YG & Jeremih]
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck (I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck)
Can't no other nigga get it hotter than me, girl (yeah, yeah)
From the back, I show you how I fuck you, girl (yeah)
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck
I could give you 100 reasons why we should fuck (100 reasons why we should fuck)
Give it to you thorough in the middle
Told 'em we should count, you could call a nigga shizzle, huh
