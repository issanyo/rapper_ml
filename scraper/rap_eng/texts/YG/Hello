[Intro]
Love cancels, bye-bye
Love cancels, bye-bye
Love cancels, bye-bye
Love cancels, bye-bye
Love cancels, bye-bye
Love cancels, bye-bye
Love cancels, bye-bye

[Verse 1]
Love spending on it
Get it every morning
Right before I'm yawning
She gon' put it on me
I've been bending corners
Smoking marijuana
Always speak your heart
Now my bro is on that, yah, bruh

[Pre-Hook]
100s make it bounce
I pull it out
It's going down
But I'm just fucking 'round
One night in your town
Then I'm back on the road

[Hook]
She said "Dolla, would you call me?"
Boy, I've been so lonely
And I see you getting money
But you don't ever spend none on me
Girl, once you say hello
Girl, don't you play, hell no
Girl, once you say hello
Girl, don't you play, hell no

[Verse 2]
I just ran a cheque up
Young nigga flexin'
Pull up in that foreign
911 Porsche
I've been making pages
Dolla getting paychecks
You should see my outfit
I need a red carpet

[Pre-Hook]
100s make it bounce
I pull it out
It's going down
But I'm just fucking 'round
One night in your town
Then I'm back on the road

[Hook]
She said "Dolla, would you call me?"
Boy, I've been so lonely
And I see you getting money
But you don't ever spend none on me
Girl, once you say hello
Girl, don't you play, hell no
Girl, once you say hello
Girl, don't you play, hell no

[Bridge]
Don't you play no-no-no-no, no games
No-no-no-no-no-no, no games
Girl don't play with Dolla
Bust that pussy open, throw it back for Dolla
Oh, oh, oh

[Hook]
She said "Dolla, would you call me?"
Boy, I've been so lonely
And I see you getting money
But you don't ever spend none on me
Girl, once you say hello
Girl, don't you play, hell no
Girl, once you say hello
Girl, don't you play, hell no

[Outro: YG]
