[Chorus: YG]
The devil talking to me, but I don't hear him
The devil talking to me, but I don't hear him
The devil talking to me, but I don't hear him
But I don't hear him, but I don't hear him

[Verse 1: JustPierre]
The devil talking to me, but I don't hear him
The devil acting up, but I don't fear him
I'm walking by faith, not by the appearance
Cuz I know that God is with me, this easy as power steering
The angels in Heaven cheering, we walking after the Spirit
Satan tempting and leering, we greet him with perseverance
Standing firm in the faith cuz the day of the LORD is nearing
And our hands will be lifted up like we volunteering
Yeah we in the building, arise from the ashes
Called to be Saints like the NFL drafting
Chilling in the will of God like we in the Hampton's
We following the Master, dodging all distractions
Uhh, Fear God, shun evil
Me and Satan rivals like the Cowboys and Eagles
Shoutout to God's people, we mashing on the villain
Yeah the devil talking, but naw I don't hear him, uhhh

[Chorus: YG]

[Verse 2: JustPierre]
I done been around for a minute
All the tricks of the devil, man, I already seen 'em
The quote unquote new things, that we chasing after
Satan's giving us the same gift in different wrappers
God or the devil give you anything you ask for
But the blessings of the LORD don't end in disaster
So I just got one question to ask ya
Who have you made master? Huh? Check it!
Peter told us, 'Be sober, be vigilant
Because the adversary's seeking whom his next victim is'
Ever since Genesis, he been on our trail, man
But Jesus still delivers like the mailman
So, fear God, shun evil
Me and Satan rivals like the Cowboys and Eagles
Shoutout to God's people, we mashing on the villain
Yeah the devil talking, but naw I don't hear him, uhhh

[Chorus: YG]

[Verse 3: JustPierre]
Jesus is number one, tell me who's the runner up
Coach Christ calling plays, prayer's how we huddle up
What's for lunch? Bread of Life? Eatin' til I'm overstuffed
Sipping Living Water, tell the bartender, 'order up'
Hol' up, the battle's not mine, it's the LORD's, bruh
I got the victory, all I gotta do is show up
Whom shall I fear, got the LORD in my corner
The old me is dead, that's word to the coroner
In the will of God, that's where you can find me
I'm clothed in His righteousness, I wear it like Armani
Without Him, but aiming for perfection, we're bound to miss
We have a better chance trying to drown a fish
So, fear God, shun evil
Me and Satan rivals like the Cowboys and Eagles
Shoutout to God's people, we mashing on the villain
Yeah the devil talking, but naw I don't hear him, uhhh
