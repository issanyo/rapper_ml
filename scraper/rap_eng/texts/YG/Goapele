[Verse 1: Slim 400]
And I was sleeping on floors
And all I thought get the dough so I made the shit happen
And after ten, I bang Tree Top
Banging on wax, but night fall and got jacked
Checked the morning side, next day I got packed
But I ran it like a real one so ain't nothing to say to that
Niggas was really on some hood shit but I was still banging Bompton
When I got to the hood, real missions, who with the popping?
Man I done did it at my BM shit so who really with the nonsense?
Man I done did hella shit, my niggas can't tell me nothing
So I'm on with this rapping, Lil Buddha got me bracking
So I'ma show them what I'm here for, 4Hunnid records, no option
I'm going to do it like Tania do it, stay in the booth
Swear to God it's from the heart, niggas know it's the truth
Niggas know it's 4Hunnid, and with this stress on my brain
Parents the only thing keeping me sane

[Verse 2: YG]
Keeping me sane, this bulletproof keeping me safe
Killing the vibe, these fraud niggas keeping it strange
Keep me away, I could do better away
Made 80 in a day, Lord keep me away
Keep me a bank with a mil plus, keep me a safe
They say dirty money only, but I blow it with faith
But I fuck up a check, bet I crash the Wraith
I be on some fuck it, spend it cause I'm mad today
Look, 4Hunnid records, 4Hunnid necklace
The top models love me but think I'm too reckless
So she fucking with me from a distance
But the squares ain't really what she want
But jeopardizing her career is what she want
Her friends think I'm bad for her image, but she don't
How could I blame her coming from where I'm coming?
And this Bompton snapback just solidify I'm thugging
But fuck it mama, I'm a CEO
Got real opportunities to get this dough
Your life start to change when everyone know
That lucky number you get in one night for a show, yeah
Some niggas switched on me, touched my soul
I had real opportunities to fuck they hoes
But I'm a real nigga so you know how that go
I see you devil fucking up my flow, no!
Tables turn, bridges burn, niggas learn
Fake text messages started with bro getting curved
Cause when I got word I wanted to splurge
Seen all y'all subs on the gram that shit for the birds
I told B what's gonna happen before it occurred
Then it happened so now I be trusting my word
Counting pockets on the low, shit
Gimmie got shot when I was a kid so I'm "Oh shit"
Fourth quarter, star of the team, I still throw assists
Not Kobe, I would have taken a cut to get my team a win
Never ever is a new nigga supposed to fuck up the clique
Fuck up the play, yeah they fuck up some shit
But it's bool, not really, but it's bool
Niggas tired of standing next to me I assume
Damn, shit went bad so soon
But as a man you got to move, so it's bool
Just got the house in the hills, Maybach in the driveway
On my "got to get it by myself" mind state
I been ducked off, getting my mind straight
The homies on the four block boosting up the crime rate
Life in the fast lane, it's brackin'
Call some bitches, about to rent out the mansion
I never thought this would happen
But shit, shit happens
They had me outside in 1 OAK
Man, fuck 1 OAK (fuck 'em!)
They must not respect what I represent
But we know Hollywood niggas so irrelevant

[Outro: YG & Slim400]
Yeah, fuck 'em, fuck 'em, fuck 'em
Let it burn like Usher, nigga
Uh, Slim400
Ay Slim come holla at these niggas, fool
Y'all know we on
We doing what we doing, you know what I'm saying
We paved the way, for everybody, everybody
(Everybody!) At the end of the day, you see what I'm saying
Nigga going to do what they do
Fuck it, my nigga YG like we swagging right now
Like fuck all that, what you got on right now bro?
He said what I got on? You already know
Red bottoms, I'm on my fleek shit, you feel me?
Big stacks in my pocket, shit, iced out Rolex and shit (ay)
Me and Slim, these niggas act like they don't see us
Niggas pulling up in they Maybach thing
We pull up bitch, stop playing with this shit bitch
Bool nigga, we could come through, feel me? (turn up)
Yeah, shout out to all my niggas
All my bitches, off my bullshit, nigga
400! 400!
