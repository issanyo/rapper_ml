Bitch nigga drop a pin, we can ride up on your spot
Bitch nigga know I ball, bitch nigga check the roster
Bitch I pull up in that foreign, bitch I ain’t no imposter
Bitch you know I got the stick, bitch nigga don’t want no drama
Nigga know I got the stick, bitch nigga don’t want no drama

[Verse: Bali Baby]
And you? You don’t want the drama

Heating up like I’m Osama
Where’s my Cosmo and my Wanda?
Kill ‘em all, no no rewinding
Bali Baby, Bali Blanca
You can’t kill me I will taunt you, yes I’ll haunt you
Acting Tyler Perry, bleeding red, I’m Bloody Mary
I’m walking out and they are staring
My shit real, there’s no comparing
You know I’m really daring, my secrets I’m not sharing
No talking ‘bout the money commas, bitch I’m hard of hearing
Five gang, bitch we really booling
Niggas really pussy, I can’t trust ‘em, why you fooling?
I know I am a princess, boss around, bitch I am ruling
Your bitch she bought my music, cause she say my shit is smooth
Riding ‘round bitch I ain’t fooling

[Hook: YG]
Aye that forty Glock popping nigga
You gon’ need a doctor nigga
This ain’t for imposters
This is for them real shooters
I’m from [?] where them shots go blocka blocka
Bitch nigga drop a pin, we can ride up on your spot
Bitch nigga know I ball, bitch nigga check the roster
Bitch I pull up in that foreign, bitch I ain’t no imposter
Bitch you know I got the stick, bitch nigga don’t want no drama
Nigga know I got the stick, bitch nigga don’t want no drama
