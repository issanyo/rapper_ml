I'm too cocky for my shirt
I'm too cocky off two Percs
I'm too cocky, I know my worth
Ohh, I'm too cocky
I'm too cocky for my shirt (my shirt)
I'm too cocky off two Percs (two Percs)
I'm too cocky, I know my...
Ohh, I'm too cocky

[Verse 1]
Yes, I'm too cocky
My bitch broke up with me, it shocked me
They say you're poppin' shit, where the paparazzi?
"YG, how you like your bitches?" Hibachi
I like a bitch that will let me talk shit to her
'Cause she know I'm her everything, nigga plus more
I'm ego trippin' and you a fuckboy
Fucking put my face on Mount Rushmore (ayy)
'Cause look at everything I did
There ain't a "I" in team, but nigga I did
The homies tell me go hard, nigga Iâ€™m is
Don't let these niggas take your spot, shit I wish
Soon as I came out the womb, I was big headed
Now I'm big breaded, married to the game, big weddin'
Get cheddar, YG 4Hunnid, I'm good at whatever
Anything you can do, I can do better

Bam-bam, fuck it up, from the back, check it up

Nike check, bitch, run it up

Rich nigga, I'm not a snitch nigga
I know my worth, I'm not a bitch nigga
Slick nigga, get the panties off quick
Give her the dick like some ranch, then I dip

So bend your back a little more, yeah, thank you
Cocky ass nigga, yeah, so what?
My first bitch left, I ain't give a fuck
