[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I brought my niggas, it was only right
Bought a new whip, it was only right
Bad bitch, but it's only right
Twenty bottles in the club and it's only right
Same friends, but it's only right
All my niggas rich, man, it's only right
Get it how you live, man, it's only right
Broke bread with my bitch, man, it's only right

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Yeah, it's only right that I ball
Only right that all my ex-bitches call, yeah, it's only right
If a nigga ever try
Only right if a nigga gotta die, yeah, it's only right
It's only right we on top
All you copycat niggas, stop, man, that ain't right
It's only right that I gas
Only right I still whoop a niggas ass, yeah, it's only

[Verse 2: TeeCee4800]
It's only right she fuck with a nigga like me
It's only right I fucked a bitch in my Nikes
It's only right that I fuck her all night, give her pipe
Have her fucked up saying, (Alright)
Ay, it's TeeCee the loc
She say my dick big, but she still will not choke
I hit that, get ghost, run around in that Ghost
Run a red light, so close
And I might throw couple dollars if I see her working that pole

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I brought my niggas, it was only right
Bought a new whip, it was only right
Bad bitch, but it's only right
Twenty bottles in the club and it's only right
Same friends, but it's only right
All my niggas rich, man, it's only right
Get it how you live, man, it's only right
Broke bread with my bitch, man, it's only right

[Verse 3: Joe Moses]
Yeah, it's only right where my flag be
All fuckin' red, bitch, I get it from my daddy
It's only right I'm a whoop
It's only fuckin' right if I fuck, you was cute
Niggas only right if the money be long
And it don't feel right if the condom was on
But it's only right, I got one night
I give her 'Murder Was the Case' like Suge Knight

[Verse 4: YG]
See, me, see, me, I act a fool in that pussy
Virgin bitches run, so I'm bool in that puss
That new Ghost 'bout three hun'ed
Nine hun'ed cash and it feel like I ain't spend nothin'
It was only right they gave me half a mil
That was only one deal, that shit got me the chills, nigga
No drive-throughs to buy foods, no dinner tables
But me Ty, Mustard all got mils, nigga

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
I brought my niggas, it was only right
Bought a new whip, it was only right
Bad bitch, but it's only right
Twenty bottles in the club and it's only right
Same friends, but it's only right
All my niggas rich, man, it's only right
Get it how you live, man, it's only right
Broke bread with my bitch, man, it's only right

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign]
It's only right, I'ma fuck a bad bitch tonight
Girl, you got just what I want
Let me give it to you, girl, put it on me

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]

All my niggas rich, man, it's only right
Get it how you live, man, it's only right
Broke bread with my bitch, man, it's only right
