I'm on, like shit, I ain't worried 'bout them
Be cool, make you bury your friend

Big cash, no 20s or 10s
One call to the bay, move it all in a day
Pray to God don't get lost on the way
I move so much weight, I caught me a case
Fuck the police, that's all I'm gon' say
But shit, look at them rims
Look at my wrist, take a look at my bitch
The car I just parked cost three of four bricks
The pack talk for me, I don't need to say shit

Go hard, y'all don't have no money
Broke bitches get mad, if they don't bring cash
Yeah, then I act all funny
But back to the pack though
Big Bern be really in the trap though
Bet your mans know we'll do the whole thing, we don't let the half go
Cash up front, yeah that's mando
