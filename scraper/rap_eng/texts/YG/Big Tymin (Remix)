[Intro: Nef da Pharaoh]
We up to 40 on the opposite
And we droppin' niggas
Ya'll squad wannabes
Ya'll really not them niggas
(Ya'll not them niggas, man)
(Ya'll fakers)

[Hook: Nef the Pharaoh]
Ooh, I'm ballin' like Baby
These bitches they wanna have my baby
I'm fresh like Manny
That's why a fuck nigga can't stand me
Bitch I'm big tymin'
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm big tymin'
(Bitch I'm big tymin')
Bitch I'm big tymin'
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm big tymin'
(Bitch I'm big tymin')

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign]
Bitch tell me like baby, marry me
Broke niggas can't stand me
With these words I'm so savvy
I twist up a fatty
She shoot me the addy
I'mma pull up
If you catch me in traffic
I throw my hood up
When I get there she give me that good love
That real good, good love
Okay, I bought a 9-11 all cash
And didn't post it on my Instagram
Fifty bands for the show, twenty-five just to DJ
Everything fast like the [?]
[?] big rims, bought it, that's what I like
And my girl like, "girl she a dyke"
What, the, fuck, hold on
Now everybody, everybody, get your roll on

[Hook: Nef the Pharaoh]
Ooh, I'm ballin' like Baby
These bitches they wanna have my baby
I'm fresh like Manny
That's why a fuck nigga can't stand me
Bitch I'm big tymin'
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm big tymin'
(Bitch I'm big tymin')
Bitch I'm big tymin'
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm big tymin'
(Bitch I'm big tymin')

[Verse 2: YG]
Hey, they say I'm brazy
I got shot and left the hospital the same day
I got hit in the hip but I walk the same way
They tried to take me from my newborn baby
But bitch I survived it, bitch I, bitch I, bitch I survived it
In the summer where the streets be the hottest
When I come out I play, like Houston with the Rockets
No the money ain't changed me
You sitting on your ass so you niggas can't stand me
My rubber bands be popping cause my stacks fat
They say, "why is you paid" hear that
When I cop the ice I bet niggas be on my dick
Man you niggas shoulda been a bitch
My money ain't gotta switch
Next year 10 ms picture me on the Forbes list

[Hook: Nef the Pharaoh]
Ooh, I'm ballin' like Baby
These bitches they wanna have my baby
I'm fresh like Manny
That's why a fuck nigga can't stand me
Bitch I'm big tymin'
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm big tymin'
(Bitch I'm big tymin')
Bitch I'm big tymin'
Bitch I'm, bitch I'm, bitch I'm big tymin'
(Bitch I'm big tymin')

Rock Jordan shoes
With the Bathing Ape camo suit
I'm not tryna flex but I'm still fly

[Verse 3: Nef da Pharaoh]
They be like "Neffy, what up?"
"You gettin' money?" Oh yeah
"You with the shit?" Oh yeah
"You keep it lit?" Oh yeah
"You havin' fun?" Oh yeah
"You got your gun?" Oh yeah
"You throwin' ones?" Oh yeah
"You stackin' huns?" Oh yeah

[Hook: Nef the Pharaoh]
Ooh, I'm ballin' like Baby
