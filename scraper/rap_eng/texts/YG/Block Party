[Intro]
Tight get with it
Let a nigga run up, nigga gettin’ stitches
Ever since a youngin’ I been having bitches
All the hoes wanna hop on my dick like crickets
Tight get with it
Let a nigga run up, nigga gettin’ stitches
Ever since a youngin’ I been having bitches
All the hoes wanna hop on my dick like crickets

[Verse 1: YG]
No money nigga, show money nigga
Got niggas in the Bay making ho money nigga
Got them hoes on Figg, got them niggas in the pen
Jesus Christ I pray for all these
That pussy got heated up, nigga beat it up
I’m gon’ start smoking niggas if they keep speaking up
On my name, I bang, my gang
‘Til the day I lay in my grave
Yeah, I was lost but a nigga got saved
Like the carpool, nigga, stay in your lane
Got niggas in jail to this day
The old niggas sick ‘cause I got bitches they age
Big homie’s telling me to get cakes
And if I do that, some niggas get sprayed
Big homie’s telling me to get cakes
And if I do that, some niggas get sprayed

[Hook: 2Pac]
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggy don't stop, sippin' on that Private Stock
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggy don't stop, sippin' on that Private Stock

[Verse 2: Blanco]
I spent five racks a day
That’s me being modest
Let’s be honest
It’s simple economics
I mean do money, I ain’t countin’
My Chronic is bionic
It’s the bomb, Islamic
I don’t want it, I’m buyin’
I roll it, I light
I load it, I fire it
You fuckboys, keep hiding
Yeah, I got the shed on lockdown
Everybody and they momma know I got pounds
Got the llama, and revolver on my lap now
Fuck that, I’ll never back down
Old timer sat in the background
I live in a glass house with a MAC-11

[Hook: 2Pac]
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggy don't stop, sippin' on that Private Stock
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggy don't stop, sippin' on that Private Stock

[Verse 3: DB Tha General]
Bands make her dance but the weed got her, oh
This her song, couple shots on she on, in the zone
No we sleep, do many if you ain’t me
I promote a million tweet
No geek, still street
I grind all day, grind all night
Yeah a nigga chasing bread, you’re motherfuckin’ right
I’m high as a kite, cloud nine, wasted, faded
Bay nigga, town S, don’t hate it
Out there, I can never escape it
Smile at they ass, cause they know a nigga made it
Look it’s the greatest G-O-A-T
Call me the goot on a coat they can’t fuck with me
Dumb tree bitch roll up
Why you playing? I’m just saying what's the hold up?
We got dumb tree so we roll up
Why you playing? I’m just saying what's the hold up?

[Hook: 2Pac]

Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
Them block parties in the projects, and on my block
You diggy don't stop, sippin' on that Private Stock
