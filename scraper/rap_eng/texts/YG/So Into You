[Intro]
That’s exactly what I want it to sound like
IHussle on this beat

[Verse 1]
Aye, bitches love me cuz I walk around like I’m the shit
Niggas hate me cuz I pull up with their favorite bitch
Seen these niggas fallin’ off cuz they can’t persist
Seen these niggas losin’ all off a basic bitch
Marathon, gotta run til your paper thick
Slauson Ave out the sunset, we could race the whip
All white diamonds, that’s a racist wrist
Look I made it out the 60’s, that’s amazing shit
See once upon a time I was on my grind
I wasn't from the Chi, but it was do or die
Police in disguise asking for a dime
Niggas barely getting by, me – I’m tryna shine
Voices in my head, I’m tryna mute at times
Keep fucking with this chick, you’ll be doing time
Frustration on my mind so I’m usually high
Bitches on my dick now cuz I’m usually fly
AC blowin’ with my music high
Rims on my shit when I’m cruisin’ by
I hustle like no other, this a new design
Look at me now, I kept going nigga, you reclined
Rap money cool but it’s movie time
And you could hit the carpet with me girl if you were dime
Getting dough, friend or foe – time to choose a side
She like my style so much she start using mine

[Hook]
I really like what you’ve done to me
Your style, I love it baby
I am so into you
You light or die
It’s only you and me
That’s right, turn to me baby
I’m so into you

[Verse 2]
Homies ain’t homies, bitches ain’t shit
Stay with that MediCal cuz bitches get sick
Young niggas getting rich, we turn nothing into something
I could turn kisses into fucking
I could turn my ex back to wifey
Yesterday her she said she ain't like me
And if she come over
She know what it do, I bet she can’t be that cool
We could bet that crap out
And before you roll the dice I’m the type that would bare back
Snake eyes, 2-1, niggas chose some
If she come to the crib, she better toot somethin'
Get it, I’m a fool with the money
I just might blow it on a honey
Homies telling me a young nigga got it
I’m like that’s cool, always a young nigga profit

[Hook]
I really like what you’ve done to me
Your style, I love it baby
I am so into you
You light or die
It’s only you and me
That’s right, turn to me baby
I’m so into you

[Outro]
All money in
No money out
