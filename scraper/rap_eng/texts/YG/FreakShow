[Intro]
It's YG 4hunnid!

[Verse 1: Matthew Skyy]
Hey girl
What's your name? Can I get your number?
What you've got planed for the summer?
I wanna know if you're coming over tonight
We gettin' lit tonight, I know that I'll do you right
Now we can fuck in the whip if you wanna
We can take it to the back on the sofa
Now watch me crack that pussy open like soda
Shawty ride on the dick, roller coaster
Dance all night, twerk it all on the pipe yeah

[Hook: Matthew Skyy]
There she go, there she go
Going down the pole
Turn me up in this club
Move and turn me on
Cause tonight is the night
That you gon' give it up
And I know what you like
I got what you like
Welcome to my Freakshow
Welcome to my Freakshow
You gon' get it now

[Verse 2: YG]
Ay, ay
Got lot of bitches and the bitches are always on me
But I'm her real friend, so I just'll pass it to the homies
And go handle me, go [?], I would touch you with succonis
Bitches wanna hangin' like my Franklin in my Rollies
Stay fresh, stay fly, stay all of the above
God damn, girl, don't I see you all under the clubs
Backroom, my clique, do niggas harder enough?
Pour up the pocket like the bitches screamin' "All it off us"
Act them hoes and crack them hoes, then bring 'em with me
She dedicated to the games she gotta think for the team
She got G's full of ass and for special moment
Ask her, what I gotta do to fuck, she say it depends
And she touched my chains and she changes her mind
Told her bust it and that's the way to make my day "Goodbye"
Put it on the wall and let a nigga go get it
Vacation dig, all the hoes [?]

[Hook]
There she go, there she go
Going down the pole
Turn me up in this club
Move and turn me on
Cause tonight is the night
That you gon' give it up
And I know what you like
I got what you like
Welcome to my Freakshow
Welcome to my Freakshow
You gon' get it now
