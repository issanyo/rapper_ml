[Intro: YG]
Mustard on the beat, hoe

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Krispy Kreme whip and the wheels glazed, yeah
When you move at night, you don't feel shade (yah)
Runnin' through the field, it's a field day
Yeah, let her bang the set at the hood date
She gon' bust down, if the beat good (yah)
She gon' roll up, bring the Backwoods (it's lit)
Park the Lambo', took the Brinks truck
Become a Greek freak when you see bucks
Is your hair done? Is your bills paid?
When you outside, do you feel safe?
If we go up, gotta take phones
I'm with some go-ups, I can take home (yah, yah)

[Verse 1: YG & Travis Scott]
Act up in the bay like Draymond (it's lit)
I might need my money like Faizon
Ey, Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ey, ey, ey
Bust it, bust it down, bust it down
Ay, ay, bust it down, bust it down
Ay, ay, bust it down, bust it down
YG come around, bitch, you gotta bust it down
Bust it down, bust it down
Ay, bust it down, bust it down
Ay, bust it down, bust it down
When Travis come around, bitch, you better bust it down

[Chorus: Travis Scott & YG]
Krispy Kreme whip and the wheels glazed, yeah
When you move at night, you don't feel shade (yah)
Runnin' through the field, it's a field day
Yeah, let her bang the set at the hood date
She gon' bust down, if the beat good (yah)
She gon' roll up, bring the Backwoods (it's lit)
Park the Lambo', took the Brinks truck
Become a Greek freak when you see bucks
Is your head done? Is your bills paid?
When you outside, do you feel safe?
If we go up, gotta take phones
I'm with some go-ups (4Hunnid), I can take home

[Verse 2: YG]
Do you cook clean? Do you fuck good?
If I hit it right, is you gonna let me know what's good?
You gon' let me hit the first night? I think you should
I'm in the pussy like bam-bam, uh, uh, uh, uhhh
Uh, hell nah, I ain't no rookie (I ain't no rookie)
Ayy, I bang Bloods in that pussy (in that pussy)
Ayy, turn the lights off, I donâ€™t want you lookin' (want you lookin')
Tight pussy, her virginity, think I took it (ayy, ayy)
Fuck all that foreplay (that foreplay)
Ayy, what's up with that Treyway? (with that Treyway)
Aye, that threesome, girl, I don't play (girl, I don't play)
Ayy, beat it up, that's a melee
G-63, I swerve on 'em (swerve, swerve, swerve)
First pitch at the Dodger, can't curve on 'em (curve, curve, curve)
YG, I don't give a fuck, you got some nerve, don't ya?( nerve, nerve, nerve)
I'm out on bail, how you feel? Go to hell, uh

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Krispy Kreme whip and the wheels glazed, yeah
When you move at night, you don't feel shade (yah)
Runnin' through the field, it's a field day
Yeah, let her bang the set at the hood date
She gon' bust down, if the beat good (yah)
She gon' roll up, bring the Backwoods (it's lit)
Park the Lambo', took the Brink's truck
Become a Greek freak, when you see bucks
Is your head done? Is your bills paid?
When you outside, do you feel safe?
If we go up, gotta take phones
I'm with some go-ups, I can take home
