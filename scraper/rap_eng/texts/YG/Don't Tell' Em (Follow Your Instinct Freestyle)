Don't Tell'em Freestyle

[Verse: Addis aka Raptile]

U ain't even gotta tell'em what we doin' girl
Keep it on the low, i wanna see 'em movin' curves
Day n night, day n night, let me change your life
Ya body, my body, la di da di, let's party, oh oh

Ain’t no stoppin' me
I take you home with me
You on top of me
Like i'm your property

Rhythm is a dancer, i’m checkin’ my chicks out
Take'em straight to the telly, check-in, my dick out
She all over me, far from a cheap suit
Whisperin’ a sweet, I’ll never leave you

Shirt, see-thru, rip it off, i need you
Dip it in, dip it out, give it all, scream & shout
Sweaty nights, you and me, we give it no breaks
Now let me enjoy, the rhythm of yo waist...
