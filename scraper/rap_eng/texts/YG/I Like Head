[Hook]
I dont like hand jobs, Bitch I like head (x8)

Fuck jacking me off, girl suck me slow
If the head good then you know we fuck fo' sho
Livin' that life as a young star
Got them hoes gettin' dirty like chuck yards
My nigga Mustard on the beat ho
You know the routine what I got to speak fo'

Now get down on your knees
And tell the lord how much you love me, then run it back
Lil' 'ratchet ho, I ain't fuckin' that
She know my girlfriend, now thats a fucking trap
The crazy thing she do for a hunnid' racks'
Suck a hunnid' homies' up in the fucking back
Now I'm asking where the fuck you went to school at
Crenshaw high shit I shoulda' known that
What that shit do?
She said her boyfriend pack, and I got dick too
True

I dont like hand jobs, Bitch I like head [x8]

Dont touch the dick, such the dick, excuse my mouth but fuck this shit
I go hard but go harder in the summer till my account got seven digits' like my phone number
I dont love em, I mistreat em, did her wrong cause I didn't need her
Dog these hoes, I dont feed em, they ask me for advise I mislead em
Back to the hit girl, I need a jump though, stop playin girl this ain't jump rope
You be on and off im tryna be all in, Amber Rose is the only bitch look good bald head
I need all head, no cuts, I need that good make a nigga say "hold up"
I fuck Bitches, Stack briches, In Los Angeles County baby ratchet city

I dont like hand jobs, Bitch I like head [x24]
