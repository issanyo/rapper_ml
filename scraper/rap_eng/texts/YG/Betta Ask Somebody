[Hook: TY$]
Tree deep in the Cadillac
Pistol, white T on my hat
And I'm with the big homies
And we smashing down Pico
That's where the G's go
Bitch, you betta ask somebody

[Verse 1: TY$]
You might've seen me in my Beamer truck
Smashing down Crenshaw
Cause I got a lil money
House on a hill and I ain't even sold a record
Me and Chordz did this beat with no effort
She like the way my chain get to swangin
When I T.I.U. when I get to bangin
And then the bitch got mad
When my girl walked up with the purple Louie bag
Yeah you heard about TY$
But you never seen a YG that's this fly
No lie
I stay high
Hopping off the G4 black suit red tie

[Hook: TY$]
Tree deep in the Cadillac
With the T hat
Breaking down a dub sack
With the homies
And we smashing down Pico
That's where the G's go
Bitch you betta ask somebody
Bitch you betta ask somebody
Bitch you betta ask somebody
Bitch you betta ask, if ya ain't heard bout me
Bitch you betta ask somebody

[Verse 2: YG]
Smashing down Rosecrans
No tags on my whip
Got money on my lap
And a mag on my hip
And if them enemies come thru
I'm dumping out the clip
Like a asthma attack
I put the pump to his lip
Aye, if you didn't know
You betta ask somebody
And the big homies got AK's and big shottys
Red belt hangin
Red rag swangin
West side 400 Spruce Street bangin
So many C notes my pockets is sangin
I mean, so many P notes my pockets is sangin
Red bandanna red T hat flipped back
And you could hit me on that aim for the chit chat
Fuck your girlfriend and when I'm done
I give your bitch back
And if he come tripping, the burner go click clack
From the hub city
Where the G's come out at night
And we wear them red rags on our right

[Hook: TY$]
Tree deep in the Cadillac
With the T hat
Breaking down a dub sack
With the homies
And we smashing down Pico
That's where the G's go
Bitch you betta ask somebody
Bitch you betta ask somebody
Bitch you betta ask somebody
Bitch you betta ask, if ya ain't heard bout me
Bitch you betta ask somebody
