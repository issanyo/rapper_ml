[Intro: YG]
I see you baby
Swear to God you don't go unnoticed
You killin' these bitches
You killin' these bitches
(Mustard on the beat, ho)
Ayy, it's YG, 4hunnid
It's YG, 4hunnid

[Chorus: Quavo]
One time if you a bad bitch (one time)
Two times just for the savage (two time)
All you wanna do is just slay, yeah
All you wanna do is just slay, just slay
All you wanna do is just slay (uhh)
All you wanna do is just slay, (whoop) just slay
Aww yeah

[Verse 1: YG & (Quavo)]
Ayy, my bad for a bad bitch (one time)
Complement your swag with a bad bitch (one time)
I don't spend too much time without my savages
So I fuckin' bought the Rollies for my savages
In a four-door Bentley truck, just us
I treat it like a coupe, damn, what the fuck?
Walk in the club, savage to the front, savage to the back
Got my savages holdin' you-know-what
Bet you like the way I do it, I been talkin' all this shit, girl I'm tryna prove it (one time)
If you heard it in a song, girl, I do it
If you a bad bitch, I fuck you to my own music

[Chorus: Quavo]
One time if you a bad bitch (one time)
Two times just for the savage (two times)
All you wanna do is just slay, yeah
All you wanna do is just slay, just slay
All you wanna do is just slay (uhh)
All you wanna do is just slay, (whoop) just slay
Aww yeah

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Big boys, big toys, slide all day with my homeboys
Who am I? When you do what I say
I'ma make sure that every day that you gon' slay (slay)
Good vibes, good days (bitch), no Ice Cube but it's Friday (it's Friday)
She love when a nigga hit it sideways
So every night, I'm gon' hit it sideways
I'ma throw a couple tags at ya (tags)
I'ma throw a whole bag at ya (bag at you)
And I love it when you mad at me
I just make you look back at me

[Chorus: Quavo]
One time if you a bad bitch (one time)
Two times just for the savage (two times)
All you wanna do is just slay, yeah
All you wanna do is just slay, just slay
All you wanna do is just slay (uhh)
All you wanna do is just slay, (whoop) just slay
Aww yeah

[Verse 3: YG & (Quavo)]
Shawty you bad, shawty you bad
Atlanta ass, I fly to Atlanta fast
Slide in it, hit you with the swag
That BM, BM swag, swag, swag
We could slide down P street
I'm from LA, girl, you know I got that woo-wee
But my savages don't P street
I'ma act like I don't see you, just act you don't see me
(One time) Good vibes, good vibes
I can tell you right from what you look like
And you know them good girls is hard to find
Like wack rappers and punchlines, yeah

[Chorus: Quavo]
One time if you a bad bitch (one time)
Two times just for the savage (two times)
All you wanna do is just slay, yeah
All you wanna do is just slay, just slay
All you wanna do is just slay (uhh)
All you wanna do is just slay, (whoop) just slay
Aww yeah
