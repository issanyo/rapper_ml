Pull up on your block and know you can
You ain't a real nigga, you fake

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, niggas bustin', get the Wraith
Spray, spray, spray, spray
You don't know about the come up, stop
Popo don't want you though, mmm
The enemies don't know you though, mmm
The neighborhood rat, you ain't fuckin' though, mmm
You ain't pop no gun, you cynical, mmm
You ain't violate one penal code, mmm
You ain't never hit a lick with the gang, bro, mmm
You ain't never did shit for the game, bro
You can't hang on that thang
We don't know you but you claim
That's a shame, that's just strange
Hoes, you imposter, ayy
All real ones on the roster, ayy
Shout out all the real shotters, ayy
Slide up on a fake nigga with the K
Real niggas take a fake nigga away
That's a shame, that's just strange
Hoes, you imposter, ayy
Slide up on a fake nigga with the K
Real niggas take a fake nigga away
Lord please, Heavenly Father
Protect me from all fake ass motherfuckers
Your name
Pray, Amen
