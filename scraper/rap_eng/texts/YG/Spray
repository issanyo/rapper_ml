Spray, spray
Pull up and fuck up the place
Way, way
You can have that bitch, I got two on the way
Spray, spray
Pull up and fuck up the place
Way, way
You can have that bitch, I got two on the way

[Verse 1: Tyga]
Got a high end bitch, she gon' blow dick
Cartier sheets fuckin' my outfit
Niggas talk shit, get your mouth hit
Niggas speakin' up, better pronounce it
I push rhymes like "Wait, don't provoke him"
I'm with a gold bitch turfin' up some old shit
Put a deuce in my cup now I'm floatin'
Jolly rancher, I ain't fuckin' with a soda can
And my hustle cold, I need medicine
Put the mink on my back, bitches know my game
5, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, swang
Top drop-top file, let my nuts hang
Bitches on my back tryna ride wave
If I give you my life, you would probably go insane
Niggas doin' credit fraud, I just credit at the bank
You can have that bitch, I got two on the way

[Hook: Tyga]
Spray, spray
Pull up and fuck up the place
Way, way
You can have that bitch, I got two on the way
Spray, spray
Pull up and fuck up the place

[Verse 2: Sneakk]
Young singin'-ass nigga
I be yellin' out thug life
Packs on the low, come see what the plug like
Really in the field, no nigga, I ain't playin' it
All fun and games 'til that top get to sprayin'
Pull up, ay
Young nigga, I be shootin' out that Wraith
I keep a K
Outta line, I'ma put him into space
Outside a nigga be posted
Left the clip off, did not reload it
And once more, tell me who want it
I'll be posted on the block 'til the mornin'

[Verse 3: YG]
Ay, ay
We be really stuntin', it's not a prank
Hey, hey
I've been fuckin' with A.E. since the ayes
Bank, bank
Just locked in the bag, the money safe
In a Wraith, on the day
I hit his bitch, bitch, I'm the one he hate
Pull up in this Wraith tall, hey, hey, bonjour
Pull up in some Sean John outfit valor
Pull up with a top model, bitch that's a star
Tatiana and her friends are some whores
Way, way
Lookin' at the Rollie, I could skate
Ice er'y day
Frostbite my whole life, it ain't safe
