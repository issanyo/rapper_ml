[Intro: 24hrs & YG]
24hrs
Right Now Sound
4 Hunnid!
With the Hitmaka

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Don't mess with my girl
I'ma be the one to bring it to you
Got my crew, we can swerve
Find your own, leave mine alone
Don't mess with my girl
I'ma be the one to bring it to you
Got my crew, we can swerve
You should find your own, leave mine alone

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Bet he say he the man for you
Bet he say he could be that, he got plans for you
Bet he done rent a brand new coupe
Bet he didn't even say that he could manage you
You know you need more
I bet that money here, you get bored
You gotta watch what you say sober
Hop in the Wraith, not the Range Rover

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Don't mess with my girl (Girl)
I'ma be the one to bring it to you (24hrs)
Got my crew, we can swerve
Find your own, leave mine alone
Don't mess with my girl
I'ma be the one to bring it to you
Got my crew, we can swerve
Find your own, leave mine alone
Don't mess with my girl
I'ma be the one to bring it to you
Got my crew, we can swerve
You should find your own, leave mine alone

[Verse 2: YG]
Stay away from my bitch (Stay away from my bitch, nigga)
Got the pussy on locksmith (The pussy on locksmith, lil' nigga)
The pussy so good, so I trip (I trip nigga)
If she ever leave me, I'm sick (I'm sick nigga)
I blowed her back, she do a backflip (She do a backflip)
In the bed, she do mad tricks (She do mad tricks)
Damn, we ain't talk all week (We ain't talk all week)
Soon as I see baby, I hit (But I still go deep)
She hit me on the phone, told me dude tryna holla at her
See 'em at the club, go, Drake, throw a bottle at 'em
See 'em and nothin' happen
I ain't that kind of rapper
Try to mess with mine, girl, that choppa, choppa comin' out

[Chorus: 24hrs & YG]
Don't mess with my girl
I'ma be the one to bring it to you (Turn up)
Got my crew, we can swerve (4 Hunnid!)
Find your own, leave mine alone
Don't mess with my girl
I'ma be the one to bring it to you
Got my crew, we can swerve
You should find your own, leave mine alone

[Outro: 24hrs & Hitmaka]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
24hrs
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Hitmaka!
