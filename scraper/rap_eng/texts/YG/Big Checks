[Intro: Yung Pinch]
Big checks still callin'

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Big checks still callin', phone won't stop ringin'
These hoes ain't lawyers, I know they need me (Need me)
First class to an island, wanna see Waikiki (Waikiki)
Big checks still callin', phone won't stop ringin'
Yeah, phone won't stop ringin'
Big checks still callin', I know they need me (I know)
Yeah, I know they need me
Vacay to an island, I wanna see Waikiki

[Verse 1: Yung Pinch]
I wanna make movies (Make movies)
Like they do on TV
Let's make a love story (Yeah)
Say you never wanna leave me (don't leave me)
We could go hit Barney's (Barney's), I know you like CDG
Your last man was a Barney (Barney), please don't CC me (Yeah)
Y'all way too cheesy, I can't condone it
Went and stole my swag, fuckboy, just own it (Just own it)
Look, I ain't doin' shit for free
It's a bag if you need me, gotta pay the fee, yeah

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Big checks still callin', phone won't stop ringin'
These hoes ain't lawyers, I know they need me (Need me)
First class to an island, wanna see Waikiki (Waikiki)
Big checks still callin', phone won't stop ringin'
Yeah, phone won't stop ringin'
Big checks still callin', I know they need me (I know)
Yeah, I know they need me
Vacay to an island, I wanna see Waikiki

[Verse 2: YG]
4Hunnid! Uh, yeah
Big checks, I'm ballin', pull up, Lamborghini
Dashboard 220, zoom past, you can't see me
Can't take my bitches, 'cause all mine still need me
I'm still a hood brat, tryna fuck Dashiki
Give her that wee-wee
She give me that ass, give me them cheek-cheeks
Don't act like you're too good, don't act like Keke
Bust it open, girl, please me
Foreplay, girl, tease me
I ain't wearin' no beanies
If I bust fast, don't leave me

[Chorus: Yung Pinch]
Big checks still callin', phone won't stop ringin'
These hoes ain't lawyers, I know they need me (Need me)
First class to an island, wanna see Waikiki (Waikiki)
Big checks still callin', phone won't stop ringin'
Yeah, phone won't stop ringin'
Big checks still callin', I know they need me (I know)
Yeah, I know they need me
Vacay to an island, I wanna see Waikiki
