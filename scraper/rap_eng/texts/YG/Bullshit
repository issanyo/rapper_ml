[Intro: YG]
You know we turnt up, nigga
So, how it start off?

[Verse 1: YG]
Money plays and sunny days
Played dodgeball to whoever had funny days
(Then what happened next?)
Shit, I lost the homie
Called his momma, said a prayer, then I brought me a .40

[Hook: YG]
'Cause it's hard out here and it's rough out here
When you get caught with it, you can get caught off-guard out here
I'm just tryna make a couple plays and score out here
But this a jungle, niggas merk you when they balled out here
(So what you do?)

[Verse 2: YG]
Made sure I wasn't balled out here
Made a couple dollars, but I know there's more out here
And in the summertime (time), I ain't do the silly things
I was in the booth with a dream and a coupe
Look at me, 'bout four years later
Didn't I tell you I was gonna get that paper? (right)
You been a hater, your bitch been on my dick
And she rim on the hit, that's how it happen out here

[Bridge: YG]
Came up from the hard knocks
So all we do is ball out
Ayy, ayy, better ask about it
When I ball up, nigga, I know everybody
I got weed, liquor, hunnids, bitches
That's how it fuckin' look when you winnin', nigga
Ayy, better ask about it
