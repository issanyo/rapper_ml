[Verse 1: RJ]
Let a nigga try me I got 30 in this .40, I let 'em go
And then go promote my party, make sure everybody hear like radio
I need so much cash to get blackballed
Girl pour that champagne in my bathwater
Slow it down cuz my lifetime seems fast foward
I been paranoid, but ain't my worries about you category
I'm getting bigger still I fit in any picture

[Hook: RJ]
Don't try me, cuz I be down to shoot it out in a fuckin' lobby
I got cases I'm just tryna put behind me
Shout out my big homies, free my nigga [?]
Bad bitches getting smashed by the homies
I got cheese, she rat for the macaroni
Niggas say they real, you gone have to show me
And if I ever get a deal, it include the whole team

[Verse 2: RJ]
Ok that's my dog, that's my nigga
I remember riding 'round with him in beamers, twisting fingers
All we had was shake the steam up like a seizure
Flyer than a motherfuckin femur
I can shoot a semis, no crimey
Had a threesome with your bitch, that's a double hommi
Cuz I killed the pussy and I caught a body
Fucked up and gave them hoes my number now them bitches stalkin'
Now what you know bout wear the same shit for five days
I throw some ones she get a rain check, that weather changed
I come from servin' out the vacant
It's turned up, I'm adderall
I cannonball I swim in it
Wake up tomorrow morning and they still with it
Pussy so good, might sign my deal in it
My juice got a pill in it

[Hook: DeJ Loaf]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I’mma get his whole motherfuckin’ family
And I ain’t playin’ with nobody
Fuck around and I’mma catch a body

Let a nigga try me, try me
I’mma get his whole motherfuckin’ family
And I ain’t playin’ with nobody
Fuck around and I’mma catch a body

[Verse 3: YG]
Try me, try me
My niggas with that bullshit shootin' shots like Scotty
My bank account got O's like the front of Audis
Big gat in my lap, try to come and rob me
No I ain't no ho nigga, no bitch nigga
Rich nigga with them shits nigga, get you chipped nigga
I put that on my soul, my whole body
[?] shoot the chopper hittin' everybody

This the motherfuckin' label
Fuck you pay me, robbin' lately
Gettin' money, no more space in my safe
This shit is startin' to get brazy
Sleeping in coldest situations
All these dead president faces
In my pockets while I blink this shit is startin' to scare me
Cuz niggas change when they get that money
Truth be told[?]
Nigga try me if you want to
Bullets like ebola, kill you soon as they get on you NIGGA
I got that 9 milli nigga that .45zy that tech 9zy nigga
Try me nigga
