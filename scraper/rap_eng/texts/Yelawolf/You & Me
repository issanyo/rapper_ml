You and me
We used to be together
Everyday together
Everyday
Everyday

[Verse 1: CookUpBoss]
Life is hard so you know I can't leave the streets
All my life been a struggle, so I grind to eat
I stay in and out of jail like the shit is cool
We gotta get better cause momma didn't raise no fool
The game havechanged
The suckas playing all positions
They had me doing 10 for some crumbs he snitched
Got your boy walking around with his hater detector
I heard they had a new gang called The Junior Detectives
I remember when momma said watch for phonies
It's cool to be cool but everybody not your holmes
Ain't no thin line between them words; love and hate
Cause nigga hate the love and they love to hate
And they'll play your wack fools just to see what you got
But them the main motherfuckers runnin' in your house
So I don't need yall extras hanging around
Cause when the nigga need you, you nowhere to be found nigga
You and me

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Uh
I bet your momma was a gravedigger
Bitch you know how to dig a hole and leave a body laying in it
Way down in the dirt swimming
I had to surf my way out
Cowabunga on the Crimson tide
Lift my blood on the water for the sharks
Made an art out of staying alive
Told me get my money up before I fuck again
Take you seen that black on black Chevy truck I'm in
A big ol bank account a soldier friend
But fuck a friend who stuck again to what I spin
Let 'em get far and then let it fall and suck you in
You ain't no role model wife to no husband
Could be tricky but I'm hustlin'
Keep it real dizzy keep em real busy shovelin'
Tryna catch me in the pothole baby
But I'm swerving like a Texan on spokes
Buckle up and bend
Corners like a pornographic fuck I'm in and out
Plus I gotta double up the rubber bands
Style stacked pockets ain't pickin' up
The promoters throwin' dope in the dressing rooms stuffing grams
Stuffin grams in your nose oh
Sweet potatoes got a ass she been chuckin' yams
I bet the Gwen Stefani track was a summer jam no doubt
Had you thinkin on the other hand you and me
