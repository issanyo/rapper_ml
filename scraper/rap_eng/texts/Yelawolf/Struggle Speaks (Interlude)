[Verse: Struggle]
I went through the fire
Flames made me pure
Feds were fishing for a confession
I ain't bite the lore
Took a tour of the country
In a federal van
The light overcame the darkness
In the devilish land
Knowing that the change must come but Sam Cook seems
15 minute phone calls press 5 when it rings
Locked doors open my mind, find peace
The animal I became is tamed a kind beast
Attending birthdays through pictures
Tears on concrete
Refusing to lose
Over the years of defeat
Now I speak the truth
They try to quiet my choir
Been to hell and back
This is trial by fire
Desire to find the higher power
In the hour of despair
Cutting out the stitches
Yes there's bridges to repair
Holding on to whats left
Trying to stay right
After the chaos of the night
Comes daylight
