[Verse 1]
Push it in, make it fit
On the floor, peek-a-boo
Move all night, bump and grind
Touch myself, think of you
I don't wanna go to hell
Does that make me a bad girl?
Move all night, bump and grind
Touch myself, think of you

[Bridge 1]
Oh oh oh oh, p-p-p-push it
Oh oh oh oh, make it fit
Come on and push it

[Bridge 2]
I've been trying to get a little bit closer
I've been dying to get a little bit closer to you
Come on and push it
You, come on and push it

[Verse 2: Yelawolf & Jessie]
Yeah, let's go
Oh to the merry-go-round we go
Baby goes down, baby goes down low
Pop star go powder your nose
I'll take you to an Alabama carnival
You want a tough white boy?
Well I got dick like Marlon Brando
Ha, that's good to know, but can you push it back and forth?
Yeah, I'm a parliament man
So light a cigarette little kitty cat, pass me the jack
You can be sufferin' succotash
So suck a dick in the back of the 'lac, snacking like a mini vac
I'll reel 'em in, Catfish Billy is a man
Yeah I'm a man with a picket fence
So pick your friends, so pick your nose
I'll park a Chevrolet in your garage
Tell me how that fit?
Push it, yeah

[Bridge 2]
I've been trying to get a little bit closer
I've been dying to get a little bit closer to you

[Hook]
I want you now, I feel you now
So make it fit
Come on and push it
I'm weak to know if it's a go
So make it fit
Come on and push it

[Verse 3]
Dirty dance, take a chance
Put your hands down my heart
Shake it up, soaking wet
This is how rumors start
Sex, drugs, rock 'n'roll
Everybody lose control
Shake it up, soaking wet
This is how rumors start

[Bridge 1]
Oh oh oh oh, p-p-p-push it
Oh oh oh oh, make it fit
Come on and push it

[Bridge 2]
I've been trying to get a little bit closer
I've been dying to get a little bit closer to you

[Hook 2]
I want you now, I feel you now
So make it fit
Come on and push it boy
I'm weak to know if it's a go
So make it fit
Come on and push it
