[Hook]
See I might go to jail, but I will make bail
If I don't make bail then I'll see your ass in jail
The cops might catch me, but if they do, fuck 'em
Cause dude'll call me out and I'll be damned if I don't touch him

[Verse 1]
See that dude? He's ready, huh?
Face lookin' like he got hit with the funk
You smell shit and can't spot it?
That's a habit hard to break 'til you run into a dropkick
From the balcony like Chuck Norris
In a pair of Timbos and the king sits in the forest
Wolf, you just threw away your Rolex, you're wasting time
Cereal box MC's, keep wasting lines
Your cornballs get popped, your captains get crunched
You might be frosted but you a Mini-Wheat, punk
I'm bails of haystack, a whiteboy that'll hit the pump
You grab a AK, I'll drive a tank out the trunk
Be humble, the written word is upon to you
Earthquake the L Train shakes and the rubble pumbles you
Some folks were born to rap, I was born to utter truth
Thou art with me, and your art stoop

[Hook]
See I might go to jail, but I will make bail
If I don't make bail then I'll see your ass in jail
The cops might catch me, but if they do, fuck 'em
Cause dude'll call me out and I'll be damned if I don't touch him

[Verse 2]
Rush 'em, leave 'em out like a bad pet
Take his money like Las Vegas in debt, that was a bad bet
Who told you to do that, damn it? Who?
When you get up, go right back to him, and tell him to come over here too
I'm a clique rusher, havin' sex with the flu, a sick fucker
With the winds with no chapstick, a lip buster
Where're your 24's now, SupaRich?
Up under my sister's double-wide trailer just for kicks
I took the bricks, put 'em under the axle of your new shit
Now you got a Flintstone's Crown Vic
Put me in cement shoes and throw me in the lake
Tie my hands behind my back, duct tape my face
That wouldn't kill Yela Copperfield, I'm David Wayne
I got tricks up my sleeve like I got hoes, trackin' over lane
Don't get hit with the stiff arm, Cadillac is runnin'
Put wannabe-gangsters on my grill like burgers on a Foreman

[Hook]
See I might go to jail, but I will make bail
If I don't make bail then I'll see your ass in jail
The cops might catch me, but if they do, fuck 'em
Cause dude'll call me out and I'll be damned if I don't touch him
