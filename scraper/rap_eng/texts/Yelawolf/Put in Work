[Verse 1: Bubba Sparxxx]
Bubba, Mathis Senior Triple X
I was getting restitution
They was getting rest
Country, rap bastard in the flesh
You gon' give me what I earned and
Not a penny less (ah)
Trying to get it, 40 hours every week baby
Working? Hell nah
That's what I get in sleep maybe
Big maybe, let me say I really appreciate it
When daddy told me
"Son it's okay to be lazy
As long as you don't mind
Table scraps at supper time
If you good with that then
Take a nap, yeah just recline
And when it's time to shine
Stay reclined
Then you wonder why you way behind?"
That is why

[Hook: Yelawolf]
I put in work
Be the last one to bed
And the first with my shovel in dirt
I put in work, for what I deserve
Be the last one to stop
Imma  rock 'til I drop to the Earth
And it's family first
So when the birds chirp
I'm at work

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
I'm at work while you eating dessert
I'm at work when you walk in and leaving church
Please God, forgive them cause we keep
Working while they giving
Excuse upon excuse for why they isn't
Take a whole lot of ambition
Mix it up with more vision
Equals either inconceivable freedom or prison
Both, literal prison systems and
Prisons of the spirit but the vibe is undeniable
When you're near it
Bitches fear it 'cause when beautiful women
Bitches hear it, see it or feel it
They get they ass and titty revealing
Beverages spilling, long legs spread to the ceiling
There's no beating this feeling
But you know me, I'm just chilling (Ha!)
But not really nah I'm really obsessing
About how the next one I'm workings
Gon' be the best one, yet
A country boy might survive
Working 9 to 5
But since this one here is trying to thrive

[Hook: Yelawolf]
I put in work
Be the last one to bed
And the first with my shovel in dirt
I put in work, for what I deserve
Be the last one to stop
Imma rock 'til I drop to the Earth
And it's family first
So when the birds chirp
I'm at work

[Verse 3: Bubba Sparxxx]
Work like that check ain't coming on the 1st
Work like that trust fund yo Papa left you undispersed
Work is to produce and re-produce is why we living
Work just because you like to get it
While ya'll was Instagram'n
We was living in here jamming
Shit I like Instagram
But it ain't one of The Ten Commandments
Since I've been a man I've been gradually
Comprehending and understanding
It ain't so much the business plan it's
It is the way you plan to handle your business
If the woman or man is relentless
God is the witness
The God given talent that's in 'em
Ain't gotta be none like LeBron
Like you dead blessed, Gesundheit
Mine is more like Pete Rose
Playing for the Reds
The talent is average but it's the hustle
That made him the best
Ain't trying to say I'm the best
Just that I only know one way to success

[Hook: Yelawolf]
I put in work
Be the last one to bed
And the first with my shovel in dirt
I put in work, for what I deserve
Be the last one to stop
Imma  rock 'til I drop to the Earth
And it's family first
So when the birds chirp
I'm at work
