Cisco Adler:
I fell in love with a girl
She tastes like lemonade, she tastes like lemonade

Yelawolf:
Waitress at the Ponderosa, bringing me lemon pie and a Coca-Cola
Couple of thoughts I can ponder over
What would you look like inside of my trunk?
Maybe an ornament, a trophy of sorts
I'll take you home and let you smoke some opium on the porch
A red eye jedi like Obi Wan with a sword
??????????
Hop in the seat and me and you can hit the highway
And I can bring you back to work next friday
I know its raining but we can make it a nice day
No pump fake Yelawolf nice play
Swish and I'll give you the fresh squeeze
I have you turning circles like two left feets
Do I gotta spell it out for you, well let's see
L-E-M-O-N-A-D-E (please)

(Cisco Adler) Chorus:
I fell in love with a girl
She tastes like lemonade, she tastes like lemonade
I fell in love with a girl
She tastes like lemonade, she tastes like lemonade

(Dirt Nasty):
Sweet thang in the testarossa
Pulled her ova, are you sober?
Smelled like lemonade mimosas
Pushed her on the hood, even got the wood
Yeah man she lettin me bang
Pussy taste like lemon mirangue
Banana thick, oranga ta tang
Rollin on your block, suckin on my cock
I'm a minute maid, don't make me wait
I'll frost your face, then I break
Your man's a fruit cake
Pop the cherry while he work at the juice place
Cause I love you and you love me
See how happy we can be
But if I catch you cheatin' or lyin'
Pop pop pop somebody's dyin'

Chorus:
I fell in love with a girl
She tastes like lemonade, she tastes like lemonade
I fell in love with a girl
She tastes like lemonade, she tastes like lemonade

(Johnny Polygon):
I used to do a lot of cocaine
Back when I was trying to act rich
Met a girl who used to do the same thing
But I don't talk to her no more cause she O.D. in '06
So rest in peace to the angels
Who photograph beautifully at least from certain angles
Gettin' white girl wasted
Always loved how cookies n' cream tasted
Face it I was God to her
At least until she got popular
It's a stupid thing and my hearts dumb
These groupies think they never are one
But you are one

Chorus:
I fell in love with a girl
She tastes like lemonade, she tastes like lemonade
I fell in love with a girl
She tastes like lemonade, she tastes like lemonade
