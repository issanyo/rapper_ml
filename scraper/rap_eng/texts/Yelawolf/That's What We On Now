Holler at cha mane

[Verse 1]
Still throwin' beer cans in the gutter mang
Flick a parliament, hub cap ornament
Deer head on the wall it's a bubba thang
Not sparks, but I'm sparkin' a Parliament
Again I'm a chain smoker, stuck to the flame poker I'm hot
Keep the party going, don't stop!
New shoes, thrifty Bill Cosby sweater
Drinkin' out the keg no greek frat letters
Bumpin' skinny pimp, Petty and Eddie Vedder
Ain't no Eddy Bauer, no scary cowards
You better check tha Y-E-L-A-W-O-L-F
Buddy, I'm in ya ash tray like a toenail clip
Flick flick the cherry, don't ash on my sofa
I'm on some new mobile home shit come on ova
Keep heavy metal like a ton of boulders
Check out my donk it's dirty brown, I know it's dirty brown boi!

Lemonade is made from lemon's aid
Then I'mma make fine china from a paper plate
I'mma dip low, like paper planes
In the Cheverolet, like it's a major thang
Sign a major deal, with a major payne
They gave me a budget, I bought a bicycle frame
I rode that bitch around Walnut park
Put a stack in my pocket and then blew it at Wal-Mart
On a jacket, a pistol, and a packet of blow darts
If you enter my scope, you gonna need a strong heart
Strong art, the heart of Dixie got history
You sittin' on 32's we sittin' on 60's
Mud tires and barbed wire you drive for hours
You won't see nothin' but pine trees and wild fires
And BOOM! Out pops a B Boy
The mossy oak is dirty brown, I know it's dirty brown boi!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Jimmy crack corn, then he threw a bar stool
Mother goose broke a wing and still flew the coup
She gave Jimmy 20 bucks and threw him a deuce
Left Jimmy on the string like a loose tooth
See these the type of people that I'm used to
Hard knock country boys fuck a new suit
Fuck a new coop when you need a new roof
Give me the whole stake from the ruler to the two
Give me the ruler too, measure it up
Theres good money in the pyrex mesurin' cup
Ricky Bobby's on the corner he's tearin' it up
If he don't slow down, he'll be wearin' a crutch
Ricky needs to take it to tha highway
But you can't tell him shit, cause it's Friday
Ricky's got a needle, thats how it's goin' down?
He looked at me and said "That's what I'm on now."

[Hook]
