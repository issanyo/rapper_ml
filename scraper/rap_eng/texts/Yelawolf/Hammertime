(Hook)
I'm gettin' drunk, Hammertime
What you say, punk? Hammertime
This one is yours, that one is mine
Raise it up, Hammertime
Hammertime, Hammertime, Hammertime, Hammertime
That one is yours, that one is mine

(Verse 1: Yelawolf)
Pull me over cause I'm fallin’ over, throwin' up
Runnin’ over rappers, drunk – “Hello, Mama - How was church?”
Another Sunday and I'm wakin’ up
Feelin’ like I ate a bowl of shit for dessert
For the first day of Christmas I want bud
Second day of Christmas I want Jack
Me and Santa Claus gonna crawl through the city in the Chevy
Throwin’ rocks at your front door, now
Shady Records, buddy, you don’t wanna war with that
You feelin’ real good cause I’m feelin’ laid back
But if I wanna run around the wanna circle with the chopper
So I can slow your roll, then I’ll do it in fact
And I’ll run around your all-black Maybach
With a can of white paint like I came from the top
When the CD drops if you wanna tell your mama
That you wanna come play like you came from the sty
I'm right on time, don't change the clock
With the prime of the rhyme - aim and cock
And the game's on lock, got the game in the box
Toys 'R U, we got "Us" on lock
Better push a mop, better find a job
Call the cops, find a dog
Cause if I make a call, then the people who care about you
Will never, ever, ever, ever find you at all
Aw naw! hell naw! I done up and done it
Football hundred, Crimson Tide, hand me a hundred
Yelawolf's raw, yeah he's done it
But I can't afford to lose this gold
It’d be like drivin’ a Ford to the show
I’d rather walk and get my Chevy towed
To the front door of the bar, I stroll!

(Hook)

(Verse 2: Rittz)
Hammertime, a Jack Daniels is an old friend of mine
I bought my lady friend a gin and lime
I’ve got my hand on her panty line
We took a pill so the feeling gets simplified
I snort a Zanny line and feel the drainers drip
Hard liquor when I’m sippin’, we don't baby sit
Drunk, spittin’ like an infant on a baby’s bib
I could get hit by a freight train and live
But chicks, I’mma go hammer - I'mma go slam her
Try the Crown Royal with a little Goldschläger
Dude wanna go run us, mouth full of shit
I'mma bust him in the head with his SoCo bottle
He gon' need some cold water and a pack of ice
I ain't no role model, got a bag of white
We bout to chop it out, we hoppin’ out
That’s somethin’ old school, drivin’ drunk, fuck the flashin’ lights
We go HAM!

(Hook)
