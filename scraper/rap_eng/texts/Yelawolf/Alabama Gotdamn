[Sample: Nina Simone]
You're just plain rotten
You're too damn lazy
You thinkin' he's crazy
Where am I goin'?
What am I doin'?
I don't know, I don't know!

[Intro: Yelawolf]
Ye, so I got this personal mission
I'mma take this Crimson Tide banner
From the great state of Alabama that is
And I'mma take it to all 50 States
All 50 States in one song
Just so I can hear 'em say:

[Hook]
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I started my journey down in Alabama
Then my mama threw me in a swamp when I was five out in Louisiana
She told me to take my state of ware with me
Then we moved to Oklahoma with her boyfriend from Mississippi
Her boyfriend was in the country music industry
So we hopped on a tour bus from Texas and went to Tennessee
Met a dude from New York at a rest stop in Arkansas he said, (Goddamn!)
"You really do say howdy ya'll!" (Howdy ya'll)
I'm a nomad, yeah, kinda sorta
I got stranded in Georgia
But I was headed to Florida
I hitchhiked the rest of the way down to Palm Beach
And I one-nighted a girl with black hair from Hawaii
I don't know how I landed in Indiana
But I got this Crimson Tide banner
And I ain't gonna stop until

[Hook]
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!

That's 12 states down!

[Hook]
Yeah, put the Jack in the backpack
And I won't stop 'til I hear 'em sayin' that
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
Let's go!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Well I stopped in Michigan with Eminem and popped some No-Doze
I took a plane to Maine and ran down the East Coast like
Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, now down to Jersey
Pennsylvania, Maryland, to Virginia, the Carolinas; back to the dirty
I bucked to Ohio
And swam through Kentucky
Grabbed a bottle of Jim Beam
Got drunk and was feeling lucky
Met a girl who met a boy from Illinois who just dropped him
Because he moved to Wisconsin
Well, I took her over to Minnesota
I tip-toed out of the room with her purse and now, Iowa!
I hurried to Missouri, from there I went to Kansas
Rode a twister to Nebraska, drove the Dakotas with Candice
Stopped in Montana to refill my bottle
I went roamin' in Wyoming and snowboarded through Colorado yellin'

[Hook]
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!

28 states down, I'm on a roll!

[Hook]
Yeah, put the Jack in the backpack
And I won't stop 'til I hear 'em sayin' that
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
Let's go!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!

Moving on!

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
I hit the Texaco in New Mexico
Hopped in the back of a truck that was carryin' vegetables
He took me to Arizona, to a trading post
I was headed for Utah so he offered me a sack of potatoes
I told him thank you for the ride up the road but I'm fine though
There's plenty of those up in Idaho
But Arizona's got some beautiful women though like (Goddamn!)
She's fine but I gotta go!
30 pack, now I'm Oregon
I hit a couple of divin' boys when I stumbled into Washington
And I still got Alabama with me
Met an Eskimo from Alaska, bought him a beer and told him "keep it Dixie!"
Lost my money in Nevada, security said "I warned ya,"
Took my car so I had to skateboard to California, now

[Hook]
Everybody knows about Alabama got damn!

That's 50 states 'Bama!

[Hook]
Yeah, put the Jack in the backpack
And I won't stop 'til I hear 'em sayin' that
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
Let's go!
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!
Everybody knows about Alabama
Everybody knows about Alabama
Everybody knows about Alabama gotdamn!
