[Cub Cook Up Boss]
Shu, yu, yu ,yu

[Chorus]
I just keep droppin' all this sauce
All you gotta do is listen
Turn a worker to a boss
I just keep droppin' all this sauce
Rubber band up the money
Get it in, get it off
I got the juice, I got the juice
Said I got the juice, I got the juice, I got the juice
Said I got the juice, I got the juice, I got the juice
Said I got the juice, I got the juice, I got the juice
Said I got the juice

[Cub Cook Up Boss]
I spit the sauce on you niggas
Cause I am the boss of you niggas
Hack it then pack it, move like the movie
Come watch me get off on you nigga
I keep a bargain for niggas
Cause I do not argue with nigga
