[Intro]
Yeah, I just want to take this time to say
You know thanks to everybody who, um
Sent me the well wishes, you know I got fucked up, I ruptured my spleen
Doctors said I lost one third of my blood inside of my body
Ya know I signed papers for my death, I was in I.C.U for a couple days
I was fucked up, but um, you know I made it through, God is good
So to all my fans and friends and family who wished me well, God bless you
Just thought I'd come right back at it, hop in the studio with super hot beats
Hit 'em up I say, man drop a beat, let's hop in the booth
Let's do somethin' real quick you know, just for the fuck of it, cause I need it

[Verse 1]
I'm kinda like fucking shit up
Still walk with a limp, like I'm telling my dick to get up
Shaking the babies and making the babies spit up
You babies are maybe gonna get it ah.. shut up!
Might aswel leave myself alone I can't fight it
Im pissed in a bar like I wanna punch a microphone
What did I get on, three pills and I'm at it
Five pills down I'm high as a mothafucka an addict
And an addict I'm adding habits to an already tragic
Situation, now I'm pacing back and forth in a panic
But I see everything in my future as panoramic
See I got a pen and my pen has got me at advantage
Probably let me in the heavens up in the hammock
Love me some fefe dobson my baby's up in a hammock
Rock n' roll hop in your '85 and lock and load
I am a cracker i am no pop artist with pots of gold
I am just, I am just a lion with primal soul
I am your highness with a finer designer clothes
I am the thorn on the stem I am not the rose
If em was rippin I would rip the entire globe
I'm so pippin I'm sippin Dew from a diamond bowl
9 to 5 I go, yeah, 9 to 5 I go
Money in money out, Wiz Khalifa
But I'm forever like the winning cheafers
A New York apple bomb, you should put me on banita
My Texas chainsaw brains all on my cleaver killa-killa
Oh my God, yeah, I'm a Godzilla
Odd thriller, odd future, odd past too
Are to the We Me He the millimeter, zing zing, Z, D he the 22
Empty crews, hes clean, cleaner than some some new shoes
Meaner than a prude new head tattoo big news
Yelawolf is on the track, choo-choo
I enter the instrumental like an enema shit moves
You faggots ain't getting women, pussy lip crews
Spittin shit dudes, I'm okay, why? Cause I'm cool
Cool enough to refrigerate a frigid igloo
With my living room, just by sitting next to Em
Drop an ice cube in a mic like an ice pool tea ice pool
Take a hike nice shoes, damn right
But take a bite throw a nice cruise cause I'm back

[Interlude]
Ya know I just want to say thanks
It's my way of saying thank you ya know for all the support, hold up

[Verse 2]
Wait I'm a great lake, shark I'mma make off
I'mma make hearts break, I'mma take charge
I'm play hard to get I'mma spit dodge and checks stars
'til they wake up and embrace me as a main artist
Iâ€™ve paved dirt roads with a rake and I made it hard
For fakes and snakecharmers who waste this great harvest
I fuckin' farmed it, it takes to A&Rs
Blazed this trail and I set sail to the main target
Hit the main target, change the game
And I made way as a main artist, switch and bite
And twitch and shake and rob and take like a play gun
They hope when I see 'em I give 'em a pass and a main pardon
You rob me and get sold for a great bargaing
The least you could do for the truth is pay homage
I see the cracks the leaks, it's way coming
I'm sick shit, wait I made vomit
Cause I'm a great comit I'm coming bring momma
Jesus Christ I'mma leaves this lifes drama
To be the bloodline of the word I see gonna
So leave me not when you speak of the king son of a bitch
I'm rich in blues, calling me what ya wanna
White as my skin tone, black as my persona
Red as the tip of the flame, guess what's burning under?
Yela, and 3-33 is my fucking number
