Intro:
[Yelawolf]
A dollar fifty... You got change for a soda? Yelawolf and Grip, (yup)
Ay man uh, why you so cheap, Grip?

[Grip Plyaz]
Cause all that i have is a...

[Grip Plyaz]
When you see me ridin' Chevy's and spokes
(I ride fifty)
When we fall off in the club with our folks
(I look spiffy)
Wolf how much you got on it bro?
(I got fifty)
How much?
(I got fifty)
How much?
(I got fifty)


[Verse 1:]
[Yelawolf]
I'm dressed to kill fresher than most who be dropping bills
I throw a shoelace through my belt and then i sag and chill
Who said that money made the outfit look clean
I walk around like you ain't never seen these polo jeans

Futuristic style, beautiful is in denial
She swear that I'm paid and I'm a fool because i grin and smile
Yep, I got cheese nips
[youth are getting cheese grits?]
How come your groupies ain't runnin' to where all the Gucci is

[Grip Plyaz}
Yeah, wondering where that gucci is?
Prolly out there where Poochie is
She got it for the low low, but i don't wear that no mo'
I hit that [Charlie Trepos?] like fresh up off the slave boat
He got then Levi's out there fried dyed stomped and laid folk

He got them Dickie's too for them playaz and the girls
So she can go back up to Poochie so she can fresh up her cuz
Then fall off in the club smelling jazzy looking spiffy
And catch a playa at the bar so he can spend bout fifty

[Verse 2:]
[Yelawolf]
Fifty for my kicks
Fifty for my fix
Fifty dollars on the real would get a lot of shit
Fifty girls running the track is good for any pimp
But there's a 50/50 chance that he will never get rich

Cause Many Men is out to get your ass, 50 Cent
I'm working part time to put 250 on the rent
But I still get bashed, cause that's only fifty percent
Momma's wearing new shoes asking where that fifty went

[Grip Plyaz]
Wondering where that fifty went?
Psh, you know that fifty spent
Now that's fifty gone
I'm left with fifty cent
If i had fifty more it wouldn't be no [fifty went?]
It must be magic how i turn that fifth into some wind


[Hook]


[Verse 3:]
[Yelawolf]
How you feeling grip?, (Cool.)
You looking fresh with that, (know that)
You got them dunks today, (that right)
To match your mesh hat
You make me sick man where'd you get them hot ass button shirts?
Man if we hit the school i need to hit the post first

(Clothes?)
I pay fifty for 'em
(Shoes?)
I pay fifty for 'em
(Food?)
I pay fifty and my
(Folks)
I give fifty for 'em

Stackin' up my 5-0
Stay away from 5-0
Careful what i buy so
I'm truly a fifty pro
