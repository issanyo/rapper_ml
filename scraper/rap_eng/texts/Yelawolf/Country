[Intro]
This is country
Country
Country

[Verse 1: Angaleena Presley]
Souped up, jacked up, turn it up, feel the love
Trucker hat, western snap, Wrangler jeans, Skoal
In a field, on a boat, on a farm, and a goat
Ride 'em ride 'em hometown, homegrown, this my home
This my town, country country yes sirree, backroad
Backwoods, bonfire, I'm on fire, firecracker
Fourth of July, white t-shirt, apple pie, barefoot
Bigfoot, bushy beard, here comes the hook

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa, yee-haw!
Whoa whoa
Country

[Verse 2: Angaleena Presley]
Turn it on, get it on, bring it on, Les Poissons
Git 'er done, hot dog buns, Chevrolet, anti-gay
On a beach, up the holler, 'nother song, good dollar
Cowboy, that's my name, blue jeans, tight jeans
Holey jeans, cutoff jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans
Dashboard, dry humpin', Hank thumpin', country bumpkin
Country boy, country girl, thank God I'm a country boy
Long-haired country boy and I'm out here in the country
Whoo, we're keepin' it country!

[Chorus]
Whoa whoa, yee-haw!
Whoa whoa
Catfish

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
There used to be a place downtown
Where they threw nut shells on the floor
But they cleaned up and went corporate
And now I don't go there no more
My mama bartended that place
When it was a dive and alive
But they sold it out to retire
And chase that American Pie
Now we got no Hank and Johnny
No Waylon playin', Dwight Yoakam on radio
Just a crazy load of these country posers
I suppose a couple are real
But they'll never make it
So thank God for Sturgill Simpson
'Cause Music Row can fuckin' save it
But I'm fuckin' gettin' it son
A hollow tip following chumps through Tennessee with the remedy
You should be gettin' some
Slumerican boss, [?] Jennings, a new beginning
A rude awakening for you who fakin' the music industry out

[Chorus: Angaleena Presley]
Whoa whoa
Whoa whoa
Country
Oh, country
Yeah
And fishin'
Fishin'
Yee-haw!
