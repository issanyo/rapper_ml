Hey screw you man! I got nothing cause of you
I hate you

Hey Ricky
Susan? You gotta listen to me

[Verse 1]
Yeah, well
I’m feeling low
Really low
How low
I am underneath the porch of course, I’ve got it bad
I wanna rid this feeling so I must find me a lady
To easy up my flus-ter-ation now!
But I'm losing patience like a bad doctor
Injected with a sickness, my body ain't a lady killer
Can I get a witness? Know I got the winning gene
Pumping in my blood line, but I'm losing lately
I don't seem to have enough time
To catch a break, instead infected with this snake and all the venom that is swimming in my innards validates the way I feel about myself, baby girl I need some help
Tell me that I got you as a trophy on my shelf, sing to me

[Chorus] x4
Slick Ricky you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind
Hey Ricky (yeah) Bobby
Hey Rick (who) Bobby

[Verse 2]
Ain't you just the one I need standing there looking at me
I heard you said that I was sexy
Really? Come prove it to me
Really, my mood is a swinger
And if you was to give it to me tonight
You'd have me on your finger
Baby I've been through the wringer
I race cars, it's not like I could ever be a singer
Wherever I linger around town
Seems the be the common place of another problem now
Bad look so why you the one to pass up
I don’t think if I was to house your ass up
You would stay, I'm vunerable[?] hey
I’m drinkin’ steady, just to keep the thought away
Baby, now listen closely
You can be the one that I take [?]
Be real, I'm giving you a deal
There's my cards lying on the table
So are you gonna drill[?]

[Chorus] x4
Slick Ricky you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind
Hey Ricky (yeah) Bobby
Hey Rick (who) Bobby

[Verse 3]
Tall, thick, raw chick where's your ball at[?]
I can see your nipples from across the room
Half lit
Now I want to smash it, no holds barrred
No show, no dope,[?] no bed, no car
Right here, right now
Bet you got my pipes running
Oh, you want a table right there
Let me show you something
You're the type of fish I really want to put a hook in
Rip off your shirt and throw onto the people looking
Let’s get away, and let’s not go nowhere
Let’s not move another inch, let me grab your hair
Let me put my hand on bare skin, spin into a whirlwind
Tell your little girlfriend, if she wanna join in
She can wait 'till later
I don’t need another way to serve a woman like you
Save her for another time, not like she is a dime
You’re tellin’ me "it's yours", well, give me what is mine

[Chorus] x4
Slick Ricky you're so fine
You're so fine you blow my mind
Hey Ricky (yeah) Bobby
Hey Rick (who) Bobby
