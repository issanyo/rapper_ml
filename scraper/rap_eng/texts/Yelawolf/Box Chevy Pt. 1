[Intro]
Yup, yup, How ya doin' today?
Let me crank you up a lil' bit
(Drumm drum rum
Dumdrumdumrmm)
Chevy, I love you baby
Let's ride around today
How you feel?
(Drum drumdududumdum)
I feel good too
Let's ride around and see
If we can't pick up, you know, Catfish

[Verse 1]
Look I don't really know
How you feel about steppin' in to my car to roll
How do you feel about lettin' me drop this money roll, on ya?
But I don't do that dough, want 'cha meet me halfway baby if you're really
Gonna cut, gonna what?, gonna take me down the road
Experience something new, that I've never seen before
Give me a song to sing to
You could be the one to hold my secrets
Girl my lips are closed I need it
You peep it, I believe it
Cars gleaming, so come see this

[Hook]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
This whip is built for Queens and you wanna be seen with a King
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin low to the side I lean
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats (MY BOX CHEVY)
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in seats (MY BOX CHEVY)

[Verse 2]
You know I like the way you look when you getchu a wax down
You sparkle in the street like, when we pass by rollin' around town
Your spokes are beautiful too, how many of those do you got on you?
Original hubcaps shine naturally got swagger
And true, you used to be in the junkyard, sittin' by your lonesome
Till I got up in you once and changed you up
Now everybody hollerin' "I want some!"
But I ain't one to share, I don't mind if you crowd around and stare
Custom will get you cut from the
Women's on the prowl for a car that's rare

[Hook]

[Outro]
(Drumdrummdrumm dumdumdumdumdumm)
So you had a good day, huh?
(Drum drumm dumdumdum)

That's right. You love me?

Yo man, my lil' buddy
My lil' Chevy! You my lil' buddy?
(REEM REEM) You my lil' buddy!?
