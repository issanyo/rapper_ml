[Hook: Fefe Dobson]
If I die tonight at least I left a legacy
If I die tonight at least I left a legacy
If the lights go out I'm forever in your memory
If I die tonight at least I left a legacy
Legacy(x16)

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Both of the wheels on the chopper choppin, here we go
Loop de loop with a Rubik's cube, a balloon and a pack, a Bazooka too
A veteran ahead of 'em Yelawolf and the Slumerican pine trees and the [?]
Cannon ball from the roof in shoes and I won't grow up I'm a [?]
Abusing booze, using rules mud tires on the Beetle, Koo Koo Ka Choo
You motherfuckers better use the groove on the 12 inch then go back to school
Fuck a report card like I'm a southern B-Boy, I'll report back to you with a track or two
I can see that you got a little bit of Mack in you
McDonalds, Mac Miller, Macklemore, [?]
Catfish Billy you in a new creek
Fuck 'em though all I really see is sushi
Chopped up like an old Suzuki
Strip that bitch like a nudie movie
Sell the parts, buy some dope, sell that dope back to the dude we stole the car from
Like a tool we use these monkey-wrench-rappers who be who-be's
Fans on whoâ€™s the true breed
Who got what, how? Who, what? Who's free?
Mixtape downloads, screw the new tree
Fuck the roots and who drop the new seeds
Backwoods Marshall Mathers, I'm a martial artist just call me Bruce Lee
Kung fu like wind through bamboo
I sit back and hang looseand sip a brew-ski
Legacy

If I die tonight at least I left a legacy
If I die tonight at least I left a legacy
If the lights go out I'm forever in your memory
If I die tonight at least I left a legacy

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Foot to the gas, fuck everybody in the way, I'm about to make a bee line
You got the Crown, then you better hide that shit king cuz I ain't the one kneeling down
I got the motor tuned in making mushroom clouds with the Goodyears peelin' round
Round, round, round in the parking lot doing doughnuts really loud
I'm outta my mind till you be giving a fuck about a rap song with this much shock
To go to a Fefe Dobson show with a matte black pistol cocked
You got doubtswell I can't blame you fuck me what do I know about Hip-Hop
Nothing, I ain't heard shit I like since "Southernplayalistic" dropped
Call me a hypocrite, yeah I'm ignorant
I don't wanna know about who, what Kendrick did
Who, what Wiz and his fiance say
Who Rick Ross eat and then date rape
Y'all can all go have a Kanye, Kim, Jay-Z, and Beyonce day
I support it but I can't afford it
Me and them is on different pay rates
I can relate to Odd Future just because they gotta couple of skateboard tricks down
But, throw that Earl in, at least I know some prima donnas support real shit now
The beast of 2014 bitch, I gotta empty plate like I was back in Berkeley on the street and starving again
Pardon my friend you ain't got the heart to contend with my legacy
