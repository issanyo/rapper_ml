[Verse 1]
I used to sit inside a '87 Silverado
With a baby bottle sippin Nyquil
Cuz my mama wanted me to sleep through it all
Wake up
Must've been the dreams she was after but I guess the cocaine and the weed called
"Hey, love"
Mama, fix your make up
Mascara lines lookin' like a mistake with a paintbrush
If only Picasso could see the pot holes
He would never put the masterpiece in the paint truck
And Mona Lisa, can I get a date on Friday?
And if you're busy, well I can't rush
My mother's son played base like a fake brace
I know I got the gold, but I can't touch
But I'm still runnin' on the other far side of your mind
Only known to the love that I can't clutch
18 came quick, dealin' with the same shit
And I'm lookin' at my homie like "hey, bro"
She ain't never gonna change
Out of the bought fairy tale
It's a song that she'll never sing
Lady pitiful of silly Wayne
I shoulda never came
And she gave a hillbilly a wedding ring
Now they're stuffin' nickelbags in the cellophane
And a single wire living by a train in the sellin' lane
I been runnin' by the storm so long that I never get wet
I could smell the rain
And I can't change that picture
But I can put it in a better frame
Throw it up on the wall of a three story home
That I own so I can go back on it and celebrate
And like Big Boi, let it never fade
Get away in the space like Andre
And thank god for my mama's mistakes
Cuz now I got something to say

[Hook x2]
Everybody got a mama song
Well I got a mama-I'm-not-home song
But I left the keys under the mat track
I'll come back wrapped
Make yourself at home 'til I get back
Food's in the fridge
Yeah, mama, you can move in
And I got a Chevy for you to cruise in
You win, the end, my friend
