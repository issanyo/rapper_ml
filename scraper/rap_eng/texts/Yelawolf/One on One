[Intro]
One on one, one on one homie
One on one, one on one homie

[Verse 1: Jasmine Solano]
Jasmine from the 215, dos, uno, cinqo, ride
Hold on to the leash like they running for the night
Pick your battles don't waste time
Wake up in a quick moment
Tell that to your opponents
Sprinkle tracks with on it
If you like the shit you on it
Say [?] correcter, never come again
Lately come back, contact
The numbers on my back remember it now
Cause I'm running with the wolf pack

[Hook X2: Jasmine Solano]
One on one homie, this is how we do
We put on for our people and we always follow through
I said one on one homie, this is how we do
Bad bitch, Catfish coming through a town near you

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I'm boomin', I'm buggin', I'm drinking drunken monkey
Whipping stolen Regals cause my uncle is a junkie
Used to call me cracker now they call me mister cookie
Chocolate, chocolate eggs tab
Sure to make you boogie (hold up)
Models in the back of this motherfucking
They looking like they already tore up
Sponge cake wanna bondage but I got something soft
So you might wanna soak up, with a bit of this [?]
You might wanna run and tell your folks
The only thing I'm running is an election
So can I get your vote
Rap's like a root beer, flow classic, always tasty
When Yelawolf gets it [?] always wasted
If you wanna get [?]
I don't give a fuck, I can swim
I put a life in stone when I came to this bitch
I'm a catfish, little brim
He is Yela, Yela is him, peddle in the 10th speed
Reach up for the B double-e R
In a car on club caps, I got no rims
God knows that I go out on a limp
Gotta get fresh, gotta get a quick trim
Damn, good to go, slum shine, good glow, worm
Baby you look good, baby did you spend my check on the perms
Smells like it, it's all good, these nuts is yours...

[Verse 3: Jasmine Solano]
Sit back, you gave it a good run
If pass, consider it done
Wolf pack music in the trunk and
Gold teeth fronting while you bite your own tongue
Son, can't mack it like he need it for the win (say ah)
Voice cracking, like he scared to jump in (go HAM)
Flavor cracking don't act [?]
Style jacking cause the clothes be fresh with mint
Ain't gonna act like it's my better taken
But I'll guarantee though his time I'll be patience
Waiting on the day when you face just [?]
[?] made in the pages

[Hook: X2]
