[Verse 1]
Yela done found his touch a long time ago
Had to walk hours before I found this new kind of road
Had to spend months inside a dark room with my candle broke
But I came out with a light that blinded the antelope
Oh I mean a buck, 'cause I'm buckin' the antidote
Could I be what they though I was, but it's kinda no
And it's kinda yes when addressin' my talent growth
They seen a star but I got life like a planet though
I was just a bud and who knew what the plant would grow
Flowers and I got flower power like Abbey Road
I caught the sun shower drenched in a pot of gold
Bless you with this twinkling powdered smoke
The wind got in my sails in the creek water, no paddle boat
Nobody pickin' me off the ground when my saddle broke
It don't matter though, a horse is a horse
Plus I needed the workout, I'm kinda glad it broke
I'm ecstatic, better yet, I'm in that kind of mode
That classics are made from

[Hook 1]
I done found my soul through change
(Where will you go now? what will they say?)
I done found my soul through change
(Is it true now, or just play?)

[Verse 2]
Yeah that's me, with a fifth of that Jack D
Still ridin' dirty to 8-ball MJG
Still got the house in the little hood that raised me
Still know dope boys, I talk to em daily
Still got that red neck family who loves me
Still hop out of trucks in the heart of Dixie
Don't try to pull me back, or apart from my history
Because I'm creative, smart and thrifty
'Cause I'll take a shotgun of PBR's no sippin'
Jump in the Chevy do some Catfish Billy trippin'
Hop on the 808, when I flip then you know I'm flippin'
Never gave a fuck about the lines I cross 'em, I'm playing chicken
Raised in the Bible Belt, but with the cross I was made a Christian
What's up world? I'm in Alabama chillin'
And I just took a shot for the ones who stop when they hit the ceilin'
Drop the top on the 65 in Nash, I can still hear em, they're saying

[Hook 2]
(Where will you go now? What will they say?)
I done found my soul through change
(Is it true now, or just play?)
I done found my soul through change
(Where will you go now, don't turn around)

[Outro]
Do not succumb to the masses ideas
Over ridicule and judgement
For those who follow the ideas of the weak
Will perish in a dim fog of enlightenment
Become the vision of the mind's eye
And carry your flame to the fire
Do not wait for the fire to carry the flame to you
Build, work, build, work, build, work
Fall down, fail, learn, learn, earn, earn and conquer
Money is a tool for the creation of a creative space
Do not squander the value of a gift from a friend
Family, strangers, enemies, atheists, partisans, pedlers, people
People in this ocean of hungry minds
Feed, do not starve
Start now, wake up
A trillion more lives will live happy before one of those trillion care or not about your happiness
Love yourself and hate only you
If you don't...
