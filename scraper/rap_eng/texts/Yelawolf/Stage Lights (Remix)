[Verse 1]
Yeah and we got that trunk music yep
Lincoln Continental rumbilin' shit is over yep
So did you overslept
Over sleep bonus that Ghet-O-Vision's a boulder yep
Drunk motherfucker I need to take me a sober rest
Fuck, give me the whiskey bottle and throw the rest in the trunk
And let the 808 hit the shoulder net
Row the best do it, screw it, hold it in, hold the chest, hold it up
Yelawolf got the shit make you come for Rittz
We control the deck, smoking cigarettes
Rollin' Chevrolets on the start killing shit from LA to Bouldercrest
So you need a break and before the rest
Fuck you, turn blue, hold your breath
Call a penalty into me going shoulder ref
We winning anyway homie you must be going deaf
You know we going left field and we grow the best skill
Cut it down from the goal so you can hold the net
If you ball in the grow a set, show a check
If you wanna win fit us in in the Rolodex
Hater why you looking so depressed?
Excuse me I got a show to wreck
And it's back to the stage lights

[Verse 2]
I put a dent in that rental buddy, back to the fender
Sack a track like I’m bagging sacks of this timber
Come get you some
Rick E., go Rick E. Bobby, here he comes
Sportin' a hicky from hicky chick-ies so give me some
Rolling the sicky sticky, give Rick E. the sticky thumb, thumbs up
Pull up to the party with fifty some bucks
Driking, not trippin' cum fuck
With a born hippie done crump
I get rythym like a hippie drum son
I’m from the bottom believe it people the freedom eagle
America's inhaling the bible belt when I feed 'em
All I wanted was to lead them to the light and see 'em
Now all I’m living under the lights of every colosseum
In stage lights
