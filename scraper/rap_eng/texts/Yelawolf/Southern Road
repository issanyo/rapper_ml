[Intro: Gracen Hill]
And so all my
Dreams
To bide all my holes
And then I sow all my holes
Just to bide my way back home
My way back home
My way back

[Verse 1: Alexander King]
Came from a real deep long line of coal miners
Drunk drivers moonshiners that don't take kind to no
Newcomers or no outsiders
Lightning rod has every vein on fire
Or pour gasoline stay ready to fight
Raised by the gypsies
Bikers, pikers, dope boys turned killa gone through a life
That taught me how to fight when I was 8 and 9
Getting jumped from a nights living on each side
Paid every toll and sold every oat
Earn every stripe I was ever bestowed
Walk miles up and down that southern road
Sold a bunch of dreams to buy back my hopes
When they ask how we did it
Tell em we ain't run
We ain't go home till its all said and done

[Chorus: Gracen Hill]
And so all my
Dreams
Is to bide all my holes
And then I sow all my holes
Just to bide my way home
And I planted my seeds
And I sowed all my holes
Yeah I paid my tolls, my tolls, my tolls
On that old southern road
On that old southern road

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Yeah after I leave the poetry
Sitting for people to marvel and criticize
Ain't no reason to apologize
I leave it behind leaving the beaver why
Maybe cause my daddy did the same to my momma and i
I'm better left to prophesize
Slumerican king littering on my Chevrolet bowtie
Snakeskin and crocodile boots under my toes
Like I rode through the swamp with the chick
And doing my favorite reptiles
Stay stepping on a serpent with the war of a pink cloud
Baby blues and hues to make you think wow
Holding my breath under the mainstream now
Only an iceberg looks this good underwater baby
Up until i make your ship sink down
Slum beautiful this rare body is cubicle
Packing the pain vein like I marsh through those pink pines
Ghetto cowboy
Yelawolf

[Outro: Gracen Hill]
And so all my
Dreams
Is to bide all my holes
And then I sow all my holes
Just to bide my way home
And I planted my seeds
And I sowed all my holes
Yeah I paid my tolls, my tolls, my tolls
On that old southern road
On that southern road
And so all my
Dreams
Is to bide all my holes
And then I sow all my holes
Just to bide my way home
And I planted my seeds
And I sowed all my holes
Yeah I paid my tolls, my tolls, my tolls
On that old southern road
On that southern road
And so all my
Dreams
Is to bide all my holes
And then I sow all my holes
Just to bide my way home
And I planted my seeds
And I sowed all my holes
Yeah I paid my tolls, my tolls, my tolls
On that old southern road
On that southern road
