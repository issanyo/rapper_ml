[Intro]
Man this fuckin' bitch
Took off, fuckin' with some college graduate
Punk-ass, Abercrombie wearin' motherfucker
Left me broken-hearted in the Chevy
It's all good though, know why
I got me bitch

[Verse 1]
Both of us was in the same class
In '02 in Antioch, Nash-Ville
And I wanted you so bad
That I forgot to mind my manners
Everybody wanted them panties
Every guy was hopin' to land it
We would flirt around and touch hands
Until we fucked around and took Xanax
And that's when you began to drive me bananas
I was in denial it's apparent
You began to lie to your parents
You should know that I can't live
Without you holdin' my name
Now my heart's in control of my brain
And I can't hold it in the lanes

[Hook]
Rollin' down 20, man
With this Jack in my cup
Feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin 120, man
Maybe I'm givin' up
Baby I'm givin' up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough

[Verse 2]
Used to fuck so much, we missed school
You was there when I needed you
I was there when you needed me
We were un-separable
When I was broke, with no fuckin' food
You was tough enough to be cool
Skate holes all in my shoes
Dope-boys had me confused
I was in love with hip-hop
You was in love with that too
What made it come to a stop?
Had to have been the money issue, bitch
And I really miss the rain
I gave you all of my soul
And all I got left is a key-chain

[Hook]
Rollin' down 20, man
With this Jack in my cup
Feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin 120, man
Maybe I'm givin' up
Baby I'm givin up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough

[Verse 3]
Who the fuck are you fuckin' now, bet he's always takin' you out
College-educated and proud
Me, well I'm just a drop-out
Can't really blame you for buggin'
Ain't I the dirt on your rug
And just the place to wipe your shoes
And give me all your thrown away lovin'
Back to my buzzin' and druggin'
Back to my gutter with nothin'
Back to the "What, all the sudden?"
Cracks in the covenant, trust in me
You ain't gotta worry bout sharing this success with Wayne
Now it's just petty change but I still feel the pain

[Hook]
Rollin' down 20, man
With this Jack in my cup
Feelin' down on my luck
And I'm doin 120, man
Maybe I'm givin' up
Baby I'm givin up
Baby what is happening?
Don't you believe in us?
Don't you believe in us?
She said I know you gave me everything
But love is not enough
Love is not enough
Love is not enough
