[Verse 1]
Yelawolf, Yelawolf
Enter the internet
Google my music soon as I finish this intersect
I grab a pen and set
Records and then I check
Come Julie Records only because you been in a wreck
Totaled by Yela quotable's
Dented by syllables
Breaking fenders and breaking mirrors
The damage is notable, roll it
Wiz, and bring it back like you stole a movie
Hippies tripin' cuz I spit groove like sippin patchouli
Sittin' in a secluded Chevy I’m reckless, unruly
Having breakfast out wit your﻿ cutie, check please!
Let her cover it cuz I’m still broke
Wit a MILF though, for real though better me that a dildo
Catfish Billy smackin' a bitch silly
Crack in a pack and packed in the pack out the sack chilli
PFFF CHHH Yeah I gitter done
Put a lump in her kitty litter puss and come get u some
