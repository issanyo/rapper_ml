[Verse 1]
I just popped some pills
And all I want to do is not to feel
Like a fucking ball on a soccer field
‘Cause everybody seems so not for real
While this moon is up
I want to ride around with you in the truck
I hope you don’t mind I assumed you was
‘Cause I went and got a room for us
So let’s drink some drinks
Until we get so drunk we can’t wait
To pull each other’s clothes off and get naked
And make the motherfucking Chevy shake

[Verse 2]
Now I’m feeling fine in my 1979
Trunk full of knock and the cup with the lime
And I think that it’s about that time
So give me a shot
I’mma take it up to the mountain top
Or we could make it bounce in the parking lot
Straight up in a police parking spot, fuck the cops
We can roll, all over the city we can go
Anywhere you want to, creeping low
Baby I just want to beat the show
So fuck that room
‘Cause I got the Chevy engine tuned
And I’ll keep it running just for you
While we illegally screw
