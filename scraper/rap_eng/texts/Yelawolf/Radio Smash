[Verse 1]
Yelawolf and I'm 'bout to get a brand new car
And drive it all around
Take it further enough, yep
And I might put 32 chromes
Sitting high from the ground
Been around, been up and down
Been high, I been low
I been thinkin' though
A couple of songs would look good
To the label if I hit radio
So what does it take?
I really don't know
I really don't have a clue
Feel like if I write too much
Or think too much
Then I won't get through
And I'm right so I don't write much
Look I'm just getting drunk
All the single ladies fill it

[Hook]
This is a Radio Smash!
A Radio Smash! a Radio Smash!
This is a Radio Smash!
A Radio Smash! a Radio Smash!
A Radio Smash!

[Verse 2]
Warm up in the V.I.P
Yeah V.I.P., with the V.I.P.'s
Kinda like them folks
Who don't wait for the row
But show their ID's
Got a bottle of Hennessy
A couple of model chicks
A bottle of Goose
Plenty of money and drinks
And all that shit
Would say that I was a pimp
I'll just let you judge
Look at this watch, biatch!
You know what time it was
Put this in your trunk
Look I'm just getting drunk
All the single ladies feeling pumped

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some in my Bentley Coupe
I'm scoping puddles poo
A million dollar man
A thousand dollar sue
Would it get me place?
Or would it get me play?
I really don't matter what you say

[Hook: X2]
