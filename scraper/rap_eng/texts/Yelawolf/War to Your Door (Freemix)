[Intro]
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home
Let the rain wash away
All the pain of yesterday
I know my kingdom awaits
And they've forgiven my mistakes
I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Tell the world I'm coming home

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door, front door

[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]
Look how I lyrically assainate a verse then
I can get a hooker shot like ervin
You never bust repping just like you a virgin
Under your girl done hitting a belly like a surgeon
A hundred milli gotta get it brrr Birdman
Christina Milian she ain't got her man
And I don't have no dreams either, I'm working
Surfing the earth and tryna stay urban
You see the heater poking out I got the shirt in
All of these rappers getting jerked without the jurgens
The similes and metaphors that I be serving gone right over their head, hot turbans
I got a business manager and she a persian
Ain't got a deal with Eminem but I am burning
Hot, got a lawyer he's really a diversion
I'm riding dirtier than 30 days with no detergent
Ain't really with the beef but the tweets I get at you
If I ever see you in the streets I'm a slap you
I don't mean LeBron when the Heat coming at you
Cover up and duck like him lay tatoo
All this cake getting flipped like a spatula
Not a act like a chat I'm a natural
Suits tried to take me out the game what did that do
Still here like the name of an ear statue
Bread cheese here funds really high
Work in the strip club and throw my lunch in the sky
Front til you die while I spend a month in Dubai
I'm a guard in the streets alhamdulillah
Test and I bet that you gon' flunk when you try
I don't even gotta use my gun to reply
You get punched in the eye, punched in the eye
What is a tie all you can blood finna fly

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door, front door

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Half of these motherfucking rappers don't know shit
Ain't seen a gansta ain't seen a brick
And they wonder why when the OG's come around Yelawolf I get the respect I get
Cause I never walk into another man's house
And tell him what I think about the way he live
I done a little dirt on my own
And I won't throw stones
So I get back what I give
Reach for the tool homeboy go ahead
If you wanna be dead homie be dead
Who am I to be thinkin that I won't pop a trunk
If you feelin like a punk
From the he said she said
Life's not a choice it's a win or lose
So what's it gonna be, him or you?
Did he lie on your bed, did she lie to your head?
Well, it all depends on the truth
See I'm realistic and everyday can't be terrific
I done see one of my boys get ticked off and put his hands on a dirty AK and lifted it
Up in the air, and then saw him carried him
Into the club, I know he wanted to bury 'em
My crew is laughing, I was scared as fuck and they thought it was hilarious

[Hook 2: Chamillionaire]
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically
Reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically
Reaching a point where it's not fair no more

Hit em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
(Yelawolf)
It's just another day outside my door

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
Yeah, I'm a let you take a second to introduce you to pain
Where everybody going through it and going insane
The inner struggle but they focused on making they change
Anybody get it away and they making it rain
If it go to me I'll probably be doing the same
If I ever could I'll forever be repping the same game
Rapping on thinking I promise I'll get the same thing
In the back of the maybach outside of somebody name
Getting brain like I was only here to learn something
Fucking with me I guarantee I'm a return some
Raise some drama then show up tryna burn some
I do my dirt and then I never pay it back
I'm dealing with it and never taking it
You can't respect, the city been awake
Never get attacked, got it, I can't hear nobody taking that
Wanna hit the block and wanna thug? dreaming to get away
And to the love I got for the streets, the hood
Call up any nigga who come that and try to fit in I send them away
Yelawolf go get the whip I got this
I open the gate ain't no way they could stop this
They want it with us, you can tell em about this
Looking for something pretty, you can em it's not this

[Chorus 2]
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically
Reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door

[Verse 4: Chamillionaire]
See the barrel shoot in the tank I'm in the cockpit
Bullets that'll jump on your head like it's a moshpit
Even if you're wearing a bulletproof outfit
I got a batman you go and robbin like a sidekick
The rap game really my chick
Topic is whether Chamillionaire is the topic
Put 'em on the line I'm telling you that I got this
Autograph the weapon I'm hitting you with a shot whip
Multi multi million dollar bow tie still be a clown it's equivalent to cho chi
Go and die know why he will tell the most lies most likely to get hit with the 4 5
Yo price pow hit 'em with the scorcher what you know about the Chinese, water torture
Can't run from the lyricism cause it caught ya
Write it when I'm in your nightmare like an author
West craving the world what I'm saving
I got a halla tip that I brought for the occasion
I put it in a weapon that was made by an Asian
My mind is a maze and that means that I'm amazing
Your girl call me papi coming with a posse
Everybody black I'm the opposite of nazi
In the major label they be thinking I'm Gaddafi
I'm taking out anyone who thinkin they can stop me

[Hook 2: Chamillionaire]
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically
Reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door

[Verse 5: Yelawolf]
Pray on my God, I believe it's too hard
Don't reach for the dogs who believe the facades
Don't reach too far to compete with the dog
Because deep in the heart they wanna? this all
I wish I could be the one to say I warned ya
Don't pay any attention
Man I wanna ignore the haters
But I can't afford to leave them alone
They say Yelawolf ain't never been in the dark
And trailerparks and made their mark
I gotta make it hot cause I was given a pardon
I gotta play the role
Serial killing rap, cause I had a serial code
In every city with a cereal bowl
When I rap, peer in my soul
I'm in the light like a deer in the road
Clear in control, my spirit is old
I'm hearing the Gold I'm hearing the foes, hoes
And it falls like a rock don't mean you hard like one
You want the credit for getting gutter forget it
You ma'fuckers forgot the credit card and run
Street credit won't put bullets in ya gun
But it might put a stray bullet in your son
Daughters, uncles, aunts, friends and nusiance
Become tangled up when it comes undone

[Hook: Chamillionaire]
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more

It's like I'm bringing war to your front door
In this game it seems that I'm lyrically reaching a point where it's not fair no more
Hit 'em with that major pain as we shoot and destroy
It's like I'm bringing war to your front door, front door
