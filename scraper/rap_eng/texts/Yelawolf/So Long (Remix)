[Intro]
So long it feels like forever sometimes, you know
As long as you keep progressing don't worry about shit
Hey shout out to the homie Yelawolf
Slumerican wattup? The Biggest Loser

[Hook: Jelly Roll]
I've been rolling down these dirty back old roads
For so long, so long, so long, so long, so long
I left the house when I was young
And told my mamma "I'm grown", "I'm grown", "I'm grown"
I'm gone, I'm gone..


[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
It's fucked up on this side of the fence
Seen 'em die just to tryna get rich
Seen 'em die just to tryna pay rent
Man I don't make no sense
Ever since I was a younger boy
Everybody told me I was a goner lord
But I wanted more
Than selling these packs at the corner store
Switch the game up and the shits get real
Addicted to prescription pills
I'm just out here tryna get these deals
Every week another kid gets killed
Lord please don't let me start this
These kids now is so heartless
These trailers parks and appartments
But the told me home is where my heart is

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
The say white trash is a state of mind
That's all I see in the state of mine
Did what I did and I stayed alive
And It's been like this since '85
So many nights on these hopeless streets
Mamma's at the kitchen table smoking weed
Ridin' round cathin' plays on Capri's
Only things that matters here
Who's got the dope for cheap's
Late nights, prayed to god
Mamma worked hard, had two jobs
Either you trap or you rob
Only two options against all odds
That's right, fast life
Dreams turn to smoke at the end of a glass pipe
Cop's in the neighborhood with their flashlight
Mamma keep prayin' that she gets her path right

[Hook: X2]

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Like a young little misfit
Fuck the world homie
I was smoking dope by the age of ten
Life wouldn't nothin'
But an everyday hunt to catch a buzz
Because of my friends
Well 16 to 19
So I'd be up to the 19th high with no ID
Despite me that ya'll right and smiling
The boy that I played in school was so frightening
I look at kids like 13 and think "Fuck man"
Who the hell were the people around me then?
I suppose that I could've made a better choice
But better choice's requires a better option
You wanna lift? I'm shopping
Wanna ride around the block? Buddy hop in
It's a winter wonderland
Yeah round white dust from the grass
She's credit card chopping
Hey Mamma, I love you but it's only right
That I'm gonna try that shit someday
Didn't think that day would be the 3rd day
After my 15th fuckin' birthday
Could've been a hearse
Pull up at the church, pickin' me up
But the lord had mercy
But I dropped that shit then I picked up the fifth
And till this day I'm still thirsty

[Hook: X2]
