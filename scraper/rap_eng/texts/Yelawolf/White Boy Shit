[Hook]
I’m on that white boy shit, that’s that white boy shit
I’m on that white boy shit, that’s that white boy shit
I’m on that white boy shit, that’s that white boy shit
I’m on that white boy shit, that’s that white boy shit
I’m on that white boy shit

[Verse 1]
Xanie bars, special K
Seeing stars in the middle of the day
Dude where is my car? Chevrolet
If I snap, the cops’ll have to bring the pepper spray
Took a 5th of Jim Beam to the face
No sweat, no chase
Party like a white boy, yeah I heard ’em say
Put your money where your mouth is, take a drink
Jack Daniels, Captain Morgan, Jäger bombs, still pourin’
Man this motherfuckin’ club shit is so borin’
I need a dive bar bitch
‘Cuz I’m

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
At least that’s what I’ve been told
Smokin' rezin out of rolled up tin foil
Everybody saying I’m a weirdo
With the semi-automatic in my trench coat
Suburbs, Honda Civic
Paper hits of acid, I did it
Quarter pound in my locker and a hundred tabs
I was trippin’ balls in every class
Hippies wearin’ tie-dye t-shirts
Sellin’ brownies at a fuckin’ Phish concert
Juggalos, Tech Nino, Wolf Pack, Shady van
Ay man

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Fuck with the cops just to run
Get bored, make a pipe bomb
Friday nights, havin’ fun
Is getting’ drunk and shit and playin’ with the loaded gun
My country’s no country for an old man
I got a mullet-hawk, a black girlfriend
Tattoos to my feet and back up again
Half Pearl Jam, half Eminem
If your friend jumped off a bridge, would you?
Fuck yeah, butt naked too
‘Cuz I’m a jackass, forever 21
Rest in peace Ryan Dunn
‘Cuz I’m

[Hook]
