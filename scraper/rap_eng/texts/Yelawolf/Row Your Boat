You said you don’t wanna die but still you want to go to heaven
Heaven’s not a place that you can scare me into changing everything that I believe in
Leavin’ what is keeping you from walkin’ out the door and livin’ life like there’s a reason
Reason is the fear of change will leave a person locked inside a dark and mental prison
Prisoners of war, the war is media, they feed to you graffiti up your vision
Visionary super scary future they will shoot ya’ they will loot ya’ they are killin’
Killin’ power of the power that exists above us is a problem - it’s a sentence
Sentence you to pull and push and jump, when they say jump you say how high
There is no limit
Limit what they sell and what they’re givin’

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there’s any room left on that ship
You don’t have to save any room for me
Cause I’ve got my own boat (even when it rains)
I’m doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
Cause i’ve got my own boat
Row, row your boat
Row, row your boat
Row your boat

They marchin’ up the street they wanna fight they don’t want peace
Peace of what you have they snatch and grab
They steal and run
They pullin’ guns out on police
Police they shoot and kill - they shoot at will
They will at you - they’ll execute if you don’t leave
Leavin’ the impression no one’s safe inside this dungeon in the city of the beast
Beasts are on the corner, slingin’ poison to the junkies - to a junkie it’s a feast
Feast or famine, come examine, take a look into that alleyway that’s on your street
Streets are not the only place that you can find yourself laying up under white sheets
Sheets in Alabama cockin’ hammers, ridin’ horses, wanna handle who is free
Free yourself from anything they preach

Even if the whole world knows
I don’t give a damn about what they think
I don’t have to stand up to your gun
I don’t have to sit down when you say
Tell me I’m overboard
The truth is you just want to see me sink
If there’s any room left on that ship
You don’t have to save any room for me
Cause I’ve got my own boat (even when it rains)
I’m doing my own thing (even when it rains)
And I will stay afloat - even when it rains
Cause i’ve got my own boat
Row, row your boat
Row, row your boat
Row your boat
