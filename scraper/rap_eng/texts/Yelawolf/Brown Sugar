[Hook: Yelawolf]

If you want me baby
I'll take care of you
You'll probably do me wrong now
Yeah it's sad but true
You got your problems baby
I got my problems too
I won't judge I don't care I won't tell
What have they done to you

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]

I Left my wallet in El Segundo
Hold up wait a minute was that Colorado
Cuz she was ice cold chocolate with a powdered nose
Kinda like an eskimo pie in the white snow
I was only 18 though I had a thing
For a woman who enjoyed a good time with a dime
Never thought I’d run into a dime with the mind
Of a fiend and the shape of an artist’s line
Fine like peach fuzz she was
Glass like frail I could tell
Ain’t that a shame proclaimed her mommy
Went from fresh meat to sliced salami
For a piece of bread she would spread
And mayonnaise a lot of people in that line
But she was already stuck in my heart
She kissed my head and blew my mind

[Hook: Yelawolf]

If you want me baby
I'll take care of you
You'll probably do me wrong now
Yeah it's sad but true
You got your problems baby
I got my problems too
I won't judge I don't care I won't tell
What have they done to you

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]

A summer breeze in the crease of the window
Whistled in the one bedroom we shared
On the beachfront ghetto of dogtown
In front of box fans on high we stared
Into the wave breaks on sand
And imagined if a duffle bag of dope would just wash up clean
And we would crawl in like boston george
Cause boston george could afford nice things
She laid we from the sex sweat broke
And on the tin tray seeds did grow
I sparked it
Baby if you had a magic carpet
Where would you proceed to go
She said I'm writing a book about me
And its called run away from fear
But since I hit the chapter about cocaine
I've been stuck on this page, here

[Hook: Yelawolf]

If you want me baby
I'll take care of you
You'll probably do me wrong now
Yeah it's sad but true
You got your problems baby
I got my problems too
I won't judge I don't care I won't tell
What have they done to you

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]

You ain't gotta die a widow
You might be heartbroke but you are not heartless
You made love to many people with bows and cars and new clothes
Cause you were the hot target
But only fools lie in a bullseye
You gave me a loose knot to climb and pull by
And I'm illusioned and used, why
I see the good in you
I feel I can prove why
We can sit inside this car
Lay white lines on the dashboard top
From the peak of a hollywood hill
And dance to the sound of vintage rock
And when this old radio stops
We can write a song about anything you want about
What you wanna write about
Fill that page
And we can write a chapter on yesterday

[Hook: Yelawolf]

If you want me baby
I'll take care of you
You'll probably do me wrong now
Yeah it's sad but true
You got your problems baby
I got my problems too
I won't judge I don't care I won't tell
What have they done to you
