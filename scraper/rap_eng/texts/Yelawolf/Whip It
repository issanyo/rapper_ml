Ye, ye, Ye- Yela, ye, ye, Ye- Yela

Verse 1
We hit the club, tore it up
Mally Mall’s got model sluts
Fearin’ & Loathin’ in Las Vegas, party, party, bottles up!
I’m feeling like a king, someone tell me where my robe is?
This nitrous oxide got me feeling like Moses
Laugh’in it up, laughin’ loud
Twist it up until you tappin’ out
But Yelawolf ain’t throwing in the towel
Take a pull buddy, how you sound?
My voice feeling like I just swallowed a frog
I think I’m Mr. T, I think I’m Boss Hog
(Get, get, get) getttie up, promenade
Rip it up, hit the stage
Outta my mind yeah, wanna go craze
Feeling like I wanna float around for days
She’s all about it, she’s getting rowdy
She like to party! So whip it shawty!

Hook
You gotta charge, I gotta charge!
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
You gotta charge, I gotta charge
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard
Whip it real hard, whip it, whip it real hard

Verse 2
Baby you and maybe you
Need to come back to the naked room
Whip it, whip, get with it
I’ll open you up like a Baby Ruth
She’s getting ripped, she’s getting striped
Swimming in a funk
I watch her skinny dip
You wanna feel ill, wanna get real
Wanna pop a pill feel out of control
Wanna know what I’m into though
That N2O
And cloud nine is somewhere down below
Get on my level, look at the light show
You lay back in the way back of the Maybach or lay back on the Lazy Boy
You can pay me back with a BJ in the ‘Lac here enjoy!
She’s all about it, she’s getting rowdy
She like to party! So whip it shawty!

Hook

Verse 3
Crazy youth, yeah, that trashy life I’m getting high, I’m in my after life, Rock star no holds barred, Got new hoes sitting in old cars, and I’m feeling like the world is mine, Arms wide open, One country at a time, middle fingers up, Fuck critics, nitrous in a bottle, Bitch whip it!
