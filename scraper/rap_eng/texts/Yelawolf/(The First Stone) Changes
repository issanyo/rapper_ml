[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
(Ah)
Triple kick cold, candy apple red ship
She grins when the C10 bed gets
Tattoos a paragraph from my life's book
Needle nose, ink drips, no lead tip
Graffiti artist in the streets let the paints speak
I graffiti beats, I graffiti war and peace
Law of above, the middle, the level and beneath
Black colour shirt boost american priest
Teeth covered up in gold
Kill 'em all dead
Shovel 'em up those holes
Dried dead wood covered up them coals
At the hot plane where we left them souls
With the hair, what the hell is hairless
Heaven in a place I can be myself ever since seven nachos
I'll be the dice, I'll be deciding my life rolls

[Chorus: Jason Aalon Butler]
There's a fire that's burning in front of me
Yeah, I'm the one who started it
Can't you see?
And there's a countdown to your eternity
It's 3,3,3,2,1
It's time to make changes (Okay, we gotta ?)
But change only comes with the first stone
It's time to make changes (Okay, okay we gotta ?)
But change only comes with the first stone

[Verse 2: Jason Aalon Butler]
(Yeah)
King but I'm cut with vengeance
Came for the face and the aim relentless
Got a chip on my shoulder expose the victims (Oh god)
You suckers better hold your Christian
Walk that shit talk I learned from them best (Who was that?)
And still gotta earn what I rep
Inglewood city with a whole lot of steps
Split em right down the middle
Never yearn for respect
And if I die tonight...
I just wanna leave a couple lines for you to recite when there's
Another riot that you need to incite and they're
Killing us off and then avoiding indictment there
I got some reasons not to fuck with these demons
Can't say no names because that would be giving them credence
And I never believed in an American Jesus
A bad religion if I've ever seen it

[Chorus: Jason Aalon Butler]
There's a fire that's burning in front of me
Yeah, i'm the one who started it
Can't you see?
And there's a countdown to your eternity
It's 3,3,3,2,1
It's time to make changes

[Verse 3: Jason Aalon Butler]
We take it, we take it
They want me to want more
We take it, we take it
We'll come in the back door
We're coming, we're coming
And we're gonna want more
So let's take it, let's take it
And cover the back door

[Chorus: Jason Aalon Butler]
There's a fire that's burning in front of me
Yeah, I'm the one who started it
Can't you see?
And there's a countdown to your eternity
It's 3,3,3,2,1
It's time to make changes (Okay, we gotta ?)
But change only comes with the first stone
It's time to make changes (Okay, okay we gotta ?)
But change only comes with the first stone

[Verse 4: Jason Aalon Butler]
Let's take it, Let's take it, I want you to want more
We're coming, we're coming, we'll come in the back door
Let's take it, Let's take it, I want you to want more
We're coming, we're coming, we'll come in the back door
