[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]-[X2]
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Who dat getting money? Ay, who dat getting money, shawty?

[Verse 1: Jackie Chain]
Yeah dats me, smoking on trees
In the back of a tinted out SUV
Got boys in the hood playing on 4 screens
Tryina get dope boy out in the streets
Better take that shit to the store, oh no
With the blunt out quick, man I see the popo
Gotta spray 3 reese, thinking no god, please
Don't let me get caught with all this dope
Got a pound in my lap, 10 more in the back
Shouldn't have me smoking, riding dirty like that
Man just let me get back to the trap
I'll never green house while I'm selling these packs
Light turns green, we pull up slow and
All that white with the music blowing
Police look but they keep on going
Fire that blunt, back up, keep blowing

[Hook: X2]

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Yeah, oh
Yell man, 1 hundred bills
Baby come and put your ass over there man
Struggle in the back hollering out "wolf"
Like well man, where the hell are you?
We done came up in this bitch with a car pool
And I done dunk so many drinks that I can't see not one of you
Pimp to the couple in the V.I.P
And I see my homie Jackie Chain is throwing bills upon the ho
I got a dollar, so let me get up in this motherfucker
I'ma make her drizzle like a fucking light snow
Well tell her rub on my gooch
She's the wildest on a pole, she can probably walk a tight rope
And I'm looking for the side show
Fall in love in the club like a rhino, I know

[Hook: X2]

[Verse 3: Jackie Chain]
I Get money out the strip clubs and get money out of these hoes
Getting money slanging pills and money slanging droughs
Getting money doing shows and money on the road
Getting money every day so I got money to blow
Hundreds over here, hundreds over there
Money on the floor, money in the air
Phd, throwing money everywhere
Phd, that's for your house player
Soon as I walk in, haters start talking
Mad at the click as the bottles start poppin
Mad at the girls cause they all start jocking
See who's mad when the Glock starts cocking
