They have the biggest testicles relative to body size of any male on the planet

[Hook: Prof]
Bitch I got money!
And I'm so good lookin'
You could learn something from me!
You're old, I'm new

[Verse 1: Prof]
Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice
Poof, Prof'll rock the party till your teeth are loose
I'm gorgeous, roll with Chuck Norris'
Fourty-five houses, thirty-three mortgages
My boats got boats with jet ski's
Three fuckin' chef's and a Wayne Gretzky'
Sunrise, I'm fuckin' in the gondola
Friends: Pheobe, Rachel, Monica
Bravo, finally made it to a dick head
Shot eighty-nine times, and I ain't even rich yet
Holy shit, nice
Bet my pandora station plays Vanilla Ice
Yippee ki yay, your boy is a Kaiser
Everywhere I go I'm shittin' on 'em, diapers
Icky, I gotcha rethinking about who the best is
I'm outta my mind, please leave a message

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Prof]
Uh, undeniably the baddest
I ain't worried long as I know where you dad is
Uah, Where your cousin at baby?
Roll around the family reunion all crazy
Meanwhile I got me fishing for a musket
Baby, busty, gotta big booty
My sidekick is a moose knuckle
If I had a weakness, it'd be I'm too humble
Be bumble, easily see hundos
Cheese the weeze, the cheese could buy three condos
Fuck it, I'm the new Kirby Puckett
Got the state of my back the topic of discussion
Dick, game, Waka Flocka flame
When I'm done with them girls they take the walk of fame
Every single verse hot, your boy don't miss
Bitch don't front, this whole song is the shit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Catfish Billy, I'm coo coo for Coco
Eat a crackers then I spit back a hobo the rollo
Eat rappers like wrappers wrapped around packs of no dough
Yeah the plastic too, twelves and forty-fives playin' slow-mo
Takin' acid watchin' your mama bounce around my show
With all the friends that she met makin' porno
Fuck with me I'm put your 2-year-old in a sleeper choke hold
Record you cryin' and let the engineer leak the vocal
Don't try to play me out, you can't play with my yo-yo
I walk the dog, Waka Flocka sheep in SoHo
I shoulda said I heard, but I heard a sheep is so old
Dictionary schmictionary, what the fuck do you know?
Go ahead and group those
Sudo can find the loop holes
I pop off the cake when you break it just to say, "Yeah I know."
Ruin your day like a Polish prayin' upon your new clothes
And a butter fresh motherfucker just called me butter fluke-oh
So tighten your belt, and thin up on your suko
Cause I'm makin' the numbers now, three three's in a row
Hennessey of trees, I'ma leave, but I'm relieved it just won't go
Getting blow jobs from an F5 in a tornado
Yeah, blow me down booties, no homo
I pop eyes like chicken thighs, no gumbo
So order me up a bucket, fuck it, with an extra biscuit in it
Then we gonna give it to a heart attack clinic

(Catch me in the chevy bumpin' Yelawolf and Prof they throw a rocket)

You're old, I'm new
