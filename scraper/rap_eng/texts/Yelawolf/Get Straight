[Intro 1: Eminem]
Shady Aftermath
Whoo Kid, let's go
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Intro 2: DJ Paul]
This that trailer park hood shit
Yelawolf, DJ Paul, let's go

[Hook]
Crack that .40 out the gate
Yeah motherfucker get straight
If a motherfucker got shit to say
Crack that fucker in the face
Get straight (get straight), now get straight (get straight)
Yeah motherfucker get straight
There ain't a motherfucker got shit to say
Cause we'll set this bitch off out the gate

[Verse 1]
My beer bottle is ice cold
Drunk falls like I'm blindfold
Head busting them Xanax I'm a wild cracker that might blow
Got duct-tape on light pole
In a big cup like a Psycho
No need for that codeine, no need to lean in my Chevy
Hit high-beams on tight road
Yelawolf is a psycho
Sling Blades and renegades they operate at my shows
You talked up, you couch much, [?]
Fuck blood stains on the T-shirt I'm famous I don't buy clothes
Bouncing all in them mosh holes
Intercorse like a rhino
Killin shit now get a grip like handlebars on the vinyl
In the woods or a porch I could've been Hollywood in a condo
Practice with that Glock 9 you see them stop-sign holes

[Bridge: DJ Paul]
Slumerican's, let's go
Going in it right now
Yelawolf, DJ Paul
Famous Stars & Straps
Bowties, Alabama
Stand up!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Straighten up like a light pole
Straighten up like a seat back when you see that P-I-G dash
On the corner waiting fuck get back when you been drinking that bottle
Laying down on that throttle, here they coming now oh no
I'm all night partying, till my body's in, shock and I'll be in, overload
I'm la-dee-dah'ing, I don't care about much at all, I've got too much money
I'm in a Ferrari and, woke up in a new Bugatti and, threw up in a Pinto
I don't got to [?]
Give me the best MC I'll body him
[?]
Let him drown in his little bitty fish bowl
Are they gonna run up and say, pussy can I get a hit, (No)
I'll let you get a hit by the 2 mil' like a rope torn of a mixtape
(N-O)
One, two, then boil three
I put CD's and MP3's to make OG's look like (kinfolk)
You better put a mint fresh on a patty belt if you want some head
If you ain't a rapper still you better put a grill in front of that bye bye cig'
Bitch I'm a hungry hippo
Fuck 'em all, like a nympho
They can suck my valvoline from a pile of beans (Pinto)
Drive this bitch in a ditch I'm filthy rich but I'm (Pinto)
Dollar at cheaa, (kinfolk) haller at cheaa (kinfolk)

[Outro]

Y'all already know what the fuck it is
Fuckin' nuts in here right now
Slumerican
Shady, (fatality), let's go

[Hook]
