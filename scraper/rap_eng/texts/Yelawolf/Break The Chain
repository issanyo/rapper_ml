[Hook]
Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sunrise
And you will never break
Never break the chain
Alabama dirt roads
Dixie flags fly
And you will never break
Never break the chain

[Bridge]
I'm from right down the road
I'm Catfish bitch

[Verse 1]
Look what I've done
Confederates' lost son but here I come
Black brothers are mine
White folks of my kind
Some holding pipes, some holding knives
Mixed family living in poverty and the gutter
Can't take your grand kids to your own grandmother's
Put Yelawolf on your sleeve, I'll be the strength that you need
If you don't need to speak, just point to me
I'll tell 'em

[Bridge 2]
Say goodbye to the times of the old
Say hello to the raise of the sun
Yeah here I glow
Crimson Tide on the shores of today
And you will never break the chain

[Hook]
Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sunrise
And you will never break
Never break the chain
Alabama dirt roads
Dixie flags fly
And you will never break
Never break the chain

[Verse 2]
People died in the woods
So that we might live
People gave up freedom
People gave up kids
People lost their land
And they were sitting to the sand
What do we do when they put the key in our hand
Let it fall in the cracks, and loopholes and tombs
Gotta unlock the souls, the Cherokees in my mind
My knowledge ain't vast, but my roots are deep
You ain't got to speak
Just point it to me
I'll tell 'em

[Bridge 2]
Say goodbye to the times of the old
Say hello to the raise of the sun
Yeah here I glow
Crimson Tide on the shores of today
And you will never break the chain

[Hook]
Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sunrise
And you will never break
Never break the chain
Alabama dirt roads
Dixie flags fly
And you will never break
Never break the chain

[Verse 3]
To Tennesse and Mississipi
And the Carolinas
Florida and Alabama and Georgia
We're all behind ya
We came a long way but we got plenty to roll
That's when the flood waters came they shot holes in our boat
I be waking in the dreams screaming
Shotgun to the head of a demon
Could have left it breathin'
But the responsibility was leanin'
I came all the way for the truth
Tell my people 'I love you'
And my black and white flag is telling the government fuck you
