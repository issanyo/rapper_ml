[Intro]
Yeah, land of the free
Home of the hard, home of the tough
Survivors

[Verse 1]
We some gun toting, church going
Eighteen wheel rolling
Bag slangin, flag waving
At the dinner table praying
Old school yard fighting
Beer drinking, hell-raising
Hard working, blue collar
Earn it all, due paying
Illegal weed smoking
Dope cooking dirt dealers
On the corner Bible preachers
Hollywood dream seekers
Muddy water swimming in
Rock and roll all the time
Straight from the assembly line

[Hook]
And that's how it's made in the U.S.A, the U.S.A
A manufactured dream, a fraction of a thing
We got it made in the U.S.A, the U.S.A
Isn't it great, how we got it made?

[Verse 2]
We some nine to five back breaking
Food stamp line waiting
Convict time giving
Underage time taking
Neighborhood gang-banging
Subway graffiti painting
Big cars, street stars
Young dirty money making
Old money home taking
Clothes in the yard throwing
Late on the rent paying
Foul mouth word saying
One-way street paving road to success
But you gotta do some concrete laying

[Hook]

[Bridge]
She’s been eating lies we fed her
She'd be full, but nothing’s helping
Knew she wanted something better
But still she took a second helping
Now she’s well-known, broke, and cold
Fendi jackets, full of holes
And no one knows

[Verse 3]
Single mother child raising
From a stripper pole swinging
Daughter's in the red light
Coats for the cold season
She don't speak, no reason why
Because no one will ever know

[Hook 2]
And that's how it's made in the U.S.A, the U.S.A
It's every mother's dream to see her daughter on her knees
We got it made in the U.S.A, the U.S.A
Isn't it great, how we got it made?

[Outro]
That's how it's made in the U.S.A
That's how it's made
We got it made
You know we got it made
