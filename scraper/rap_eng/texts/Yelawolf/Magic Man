[Intro]

[Hook]
The magic is all around
What goes up don't always come back down
Look at what I found
That's the sound that's the man Magic Man

[Verse 1]
Magic Man walk in the town
You know how it's going down
Dressed to kill the message is clear
I'm on the scene I'm dope I'm here
Flashy cars and shiny things disappear under the sheets
Now that's magic that's fantastic what is it you need?
I got a matress come to your room like David Blaine
Up the wall with no strings
Im the key to the party Im the beast to the heart
? to all the women get naughty
95 degrees inside but I'm a breeze relieve the vibe
Abracadabra what are you after?
I got what you need inside this little bag

[Hook}
