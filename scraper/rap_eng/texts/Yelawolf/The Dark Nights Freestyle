[Intro: Yelawolf]

Slumerican, Slumerican shit, yeah, what up Rittz, what up Strugg', what up Big Henry, yeah Alabama motherfucker, Big Henry Motherfucker

[Verse 1: Big Henry]

Man I come from a small town
Dump with a big dream
Where most of us fall short
Cause shit ain't what it seems
The gutter don't hold much
But goons and young sluts
Guns and hard white
One hell of a hard life
Remember them dark nights
I Thought I wouldn't away
I come from a vision
Of pyrex and a piece of ice
I popped in the Killer Mike
Rolled up and got it tight
Drinking like fuck my life
Fuck it I'm on it, right
Imagine them dim lights
Beakers and brass pipes
Them didn't like dude, so harmful for the night
That's how shit move
When there ain't shit to lose
You lookin' at living proof
I give him a better blues
I'm high as a bonfire
Kush got me dumb high
I ride for the team nigga
It's Slum alumni
Along with that "Roll Tide"
I see 'em with four eyes
They heard I was coming nigga
I'm coming with more guys
Cause I could remember
No coat in the winter
Mama working two jobs
Peanut butter was dinner
It was me and my brother
Feeling somebody would get us
Had no name brand clothes
Them hoes laugh when I enter
Now I stand and deliver
What you need come and get it
To pushing narcotics around a circle at Forest River
Asking a nigga
Yeah Big Henry get which ya
A dream and a bag
Can't you see that picture
Man I'm out on the block
Got an ounce and a Glock
Where the gangsta's party
Snoop Dogg and 'Pac
Where the sun don't shine
Where the young hoes ball
Where The corner's hot
Snitches talking to cops
Looking up from the bottom
You only dream about the top
That's why niggas like me
We ain't sleeping a lot

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Yeah
Hop out the box, with two Glocks cocked, and rob two cops
Without a mask, for cash, like it's a new job
I'm hotter than a fat bitch in tube socks
With boobs hoppin' up and down profusely in a perfume shop
I put culture and words in a huge knot
And let 'em figure it out like it's a rubik's cube block
I let you enter my house, but the room's locked
So you see me like you see a movie when the perfect view's blocked
I abuse props
Take 'em with a grain of salt
Like you take a grain of Wheat
And Boil it to brew hops
Still drinking, yeah
I swear I tried to stop
But being sober is like being a soldier on goon watch
I can't relax
So me and the crew shop
Sound scientists buying the finest of that boom knock
Let the loot drop
In the boondock, my soul's a tomb popped
Thanks, the world knows my name because of the trunk that you popped
So fuck dollar stores lookin' for brooms, mops
Soap, cereal, they might, but you not
Now, Famous Family look at my shoe drop
Wow, Travis Barker and me carry a tattoo flock
Ya snooze ya lose
Cock suckers confused, Ha!
But see for me it ain't no news to do rock
But to pursue spots at the top next to a few gods
That were born veteran groomed
Obvisouly watched over, I'm do lots
So give me that blue dropped Chevy
And Throw some spokes on it
Pokin' out, Ooh Ah!
Parking in front of that Maybach like dude stop
Now let 'em choke on that 1985 fumes brah
I been on some butterflying el cocoon batter
Take flight and you can hear That sonic boom shock
This Alabama tornado spitting just blew rocks at your rooftop
You're still looking for proof, stop
It's right in front of your glue sniffer
You fools enter, the cave with the caucasian, to be confuse not
With any other bafoon jock
Motherfuckers ante Up
When I inject the vein check the spoon's hot
I'm that boy
Yelawolf's in the mood, I
Howl in the mic like the wolf does when he moon watch
These cowards are doomed, popped, busting, and chewed, Blah!
Fucking disgusting to taste
Give me the soup 'ma
Bucket of fucking disgrace
Such a horrendous display of a king
Who is the matriarch of this new pop?
They threw me under the table as soon as possible
Now I'm just looking Up every bitch's dress in hip hop
Pussies...
