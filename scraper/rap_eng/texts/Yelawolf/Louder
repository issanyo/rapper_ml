[Chorus: Sam Trocki]
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear—

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yelawolf, Yelawolf, get a handle
Get a grip, get ammo
It's the return of camo
A hick with a hit's, a trick with this Kango
Anywhere can't do anything and I chewed, I sticked to gets me this candle
Lid and descry, but this candle's been lit, by this vandal
Eminem thinks this kid's sick and dismantled
From the triage in Atlanta
To the sea in Alabama
For me to be another channel
For you, to serve things scrambled
Top form and alive, I bust so much fire that my dick's a Roman candle
Sip so up high, sip so much Jack that my last name should have been Daniels

[Bridge: Yelawolf]
Yeah, and I'm standing on this fuckin' stage
I come from the bottom of a bottle to the top here, I’m talkin' Lemonade
Fuck lemons, bitch, look at me now, Shady
Put me in the front row, pow, crank it, I—

[Chorus]
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear—

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
My accent's no accident
And that I wouldn't make it
I just smiled and grabbed my nuts, fuck 'em
Sometimes you (Need to hear)
Cause when I realize, I'ma doubling me one debt wherever the fuck up what I get
I never look back and I told my damn ho "everywhere I'm with you" (Need to hear!)
I was kicked down and kicked again
'Till I was kicking in
Every lock and hedge
Dropped my friends, tryna hold me back
So I can hit the road and rock again
And there they are

[Bridge]
But I'm standing on this fuckin' stage
I come from the bottom of a bottle to the top here, I’m talkin' Lemonade
Fuck lemons, bitch, look at me now, Shady
Put me in the front row, pow, crank it, I—

[Chorus]
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear—

[Interlude: Yelawolf, Sam Trocki]
Yelawolf!
Loud!
Need to hear—

[Chorus]
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear louder
Need to hear
