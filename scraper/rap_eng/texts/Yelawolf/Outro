[Intro: Yelawolf]
Yeah, Slumdon Bridge
Mr Ed, Catfish
Back me up, let's go

[Verse: Yelawolf]
I’m out to bark again, ball cracked on the target
Demolish it, don’t jump out your seat, nah, take a squat and then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech? Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's
Several pauses, you might need a coffin wit'
Holes in the top, with these tubes to receive oxygen
(Yeah) You're buried alive like a freak, six-feet
Clawin' and snatchin' and gnawin' like a cat, and a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen with a frog and all there is to eat is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth, and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of him
See that, you back two bars again, he's asleep in a coffin, man
I’m all thee all that’s been, ever was, I'm the start of it
You mention the squad and then you mention the god of pens
Not of men, but of harder than flesh, I’m harder than
Titanium breastplates that are polished, then
Sticking emcees up like a fly-trap, or a bobby-pin
When I rap I’m astonishing
I attack tracks like a train-track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave’s that's what I made, got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shihtzus, pisses on igloos
Throw it up 'til the whole fucking world is sick too
Vomitin' stomach-fluid like you just ate shit-stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does Little Johnny give a shit if he sniffed glue
Or Beethoven care if you like his hair or the stick used
To orchestrate, or does a porpoise hate when you dip through
Swimming in his ocean? No, he just moves
What I’m trying to say is
It’s my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built the bridge, Slumdon Bridge, holler
