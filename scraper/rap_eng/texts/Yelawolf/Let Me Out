Hey, somebody done let me out

Let’s go, 1,2,3,4, hey!
Motherfucker I walk with a crowd!
People yelling
Hey, somebody come let me out
(Yeah, tell 'em)
Oh, somebody done let me out
And I was sitting in the back, drunk in the parking lot
Drinking Jack with my finger to the clouds!

Drinking Jack, holding pills
Fuck with my, motor skills
Can’t drive, hold the wheel
Hey, somebody done let me out
Call me back, can’t talk
Hold me up, can’t walk
Marijuana, fuck y’all
Hey somebody done let me out
Plenty beef? Meat racks
Grill em all, big macs
Shady bitch, quick raps
