Travis Barker, yeah, let, let, let's go
(Let's go)
Lil' Jon, Yelawolf, let, let, let's go
(Let's go)

Twista and my homeboy Busta Rhymes
(Let's go)
Holla 'em

Before I
Take another minute just to give everybody a movie
Never seen, I'ma hit 'em with another (Elbow)
Let me get up everybody
That be movin' with Travis Barker
On your mark, so ya ready? (Let's go)
Wow, okay, here we go again
You see the wind I'm blowin' in and I'm like a manglin'
The way that I'd be manglin' the beat, they call me Dracula
Then they see the fangs goin' in
Wow, uh huh
Everybody know that I'ma come and I'ma go, huh
Then I gotta do what I be comin' in to do
A body to the beat
In other way, we givin' them a show
Keys to the ignition and step on the gas
And bust a bottle and pour me a shot in my glass
Where we at, where we at, where we at?
And we back up in the building
And we coming with a scorcher
Y'all already know who it is, it's Busta Bust and Travis Barker
Back to the beat, see we gotta go
When we hit the fire trucks, everybody better know
That we 'bout to let it blow
And we gotta get it yo, everybody if you really wit me
(Let's go)

Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

I already spittin' to the rhythm of the piano
So now I gotta give the drummer some
Put the T up on the track, I be phenomenal
'Cause when it come to havin' a hit, I'ma make another one
Blink a 182 times when you see the Twista with Travis, madness
Kinda like a savage, grab it
And murder with the art like blood on the a canvas, 'anis
Kinda incredible how I can spit it
And get up of middle intricate piles of a kick drum
Diabolical, the lyrical flow
That'll swallow if you theoretical thinkin' that you can get some
I'ma hit'em with the Lamborghini flow
With the speed of a Bugatti
I'm from another planet when I spit a verse
With the weed in my body
And I'ma hurt 'em every time I get up in the booth
Sippin' on the liquor, 182 proof
Now they wanna say they should have never let me loose
Outta the cage, now come and see what I'ma do
It's Twista the jace, and The Rock on the track
And they hit you with the midwest flow
Even if you ain't ready yet, all I gotta say is ready set
(Let's go)

Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

Drive by, hit you with the two piece combo
While I'm hangin' out the window of your Daddy's Lambo'
Scrambled eggs, I got scrambled ammo
Leave you on top of the water like a banana boat
Yeah, I'm an animal, everybody's edible
And Yelawolf is headed for your arm and your hand
And yo' head, I'm a cannibal
Good heavens the man’s hopping over the fence like a fuckin antelope
Soooo send him to me in a minute when you're finished and I'll put him in a vice grip
Put an end to the image
And I'll send it to 'em via independent fuckin' with the mic grill
I might slip and pull the trigger back
In a submarine with sub machine loaded
In an ocean, hot deep
Deep enough to leave the submarine imploded
Promenade mothafucker vámanos
It's me and I'm sick in the prog(a)nosis
Got more bars than Barney Fife
And I’ll put you behind them like Howdy Opie
I can make your mama really proud to know me
And your broke daddy is down to loan me
Gave me fifty bucks in penny rolls
Just to be in one of my videos, yeah, homie let's go

Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go
Hey, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go

Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
Let's go, let's go, let's go
