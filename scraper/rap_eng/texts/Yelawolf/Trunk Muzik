[Intro]
Trunk Muzik
Trunk Muzik
Burn One
Burn One

[Verse 1]
Straight from the back and the game I rock it
Yelawolf's got that crack boy
In the woods with the SK I'm cockin'
You don't want to play with that toy
Droppin' this heat like an asteroid
Good in the south like Pastor Troy
Pull up inside of a 1977
Sittin' back and sippin' my crown and seven
Pimpin' I'm about to get down
Look at me changin' lanes
Twin pipes lookin' like dragon's breath (Roo)
Chevrolet's blowin' flames
Yes, I know it's strange
Hit you in a left eye, hold the change
Bitch I'm too heavy to carry
You don't wanna bury yourself underneath the 808
I'll drop it in your face like

[Hook]
To the DJs
Out cruisin'
I got that Trunk Muzik
Everybody hop in the Cadillac and idle back on my throttle
And Chevrolet's with the bottom won't you roll the window down
If you cruising
I got that Trunk Muzik
Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf
On the 808 come and fade away, ain’t no better way to get down

[Verse 2]
I told you I was coming
Said I'd be here in 5
And even though I brought you glasses
You still can't believe your eyes
But if you don't believe it by now
Fuck it, just lean to the side
Hold up wait a minute, I don't really wanna leave without a single solitary soul in need of what I'm bringing to him
To be a sail and catch my drift
Lead me to the door, check my list
Meet me at the floor, catch this fist
Or meet me at the store, catch this lick
Build this house, flip this brick
Real skateboarders feel this grip
Moving through the alleyway and look at all the people tripping
'Cause I'm on it chopping like

[Hook]
To the DJs
Out cruisin'
I got that Trunk Muzik
Everybody hop in the Cadillac and idle back on my throttle
And Chevrolet's with the bottom won't you roll the window down
If you cruising
I got that Trunk Muzik
Alabama's unanimous animal Yelawolf
On the 808 come and fade away, ain’t no better way to get down

[Verse 3]
I have to be the hardest, I got diamond nuts
I piss excellence, Ricky Bobby lines 'em up
Catfish Billy half-pints 'em up
Yelawolf country fries 'em up
Put 'em in a duffle bag and I roll up in a river then I... hold up
Watch what the fuck you hold up
Dynamite sticks will blow up
Ghet-O-Vision got this sewed up
Roll up, smoke up
Everybody wishin' they chose us
But we don't give a fuck you know what
I know you didn't see me coming but I'm coming anyway
Bitch Yelawolf is stylin' on you

[Hook]
DJs
Out cruisin'

And Chevrolet's with the bottom won't you roll the window down
If you cruising
I got that Trunk Muzik

On the 808 come and fade away, ain’t no better way to get down
