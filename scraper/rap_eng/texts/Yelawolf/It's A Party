[Intro: Yelawolf]
We’re gonna move from Yami, Miami to atlanti, all the way to Bami
Its Yelawolf, Catfish Billy, featuring none other than the greatest, Jim Johnson, B.o.B
Mixtape for you bitches!

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
It’s B.o.B. and Yeller
And this here is my feller
From Bama to Decatur
We slamming posing players
Those sounds are fucking haters
I see 'em on the ground
They get chopped up like a grass blade
When the lawn mowers running out
Get weed eated, mistreated
This heat with this MC
It is a blessing to behold
So hold this Bible, hoe!
Out of control, out of my head
And when I roll up out of my bed
I could put a bitch on total freeze
When I give her my morning breath
That's right hooker, get the up out of here
You ain't gotta love me, just get hell up and get me a beer (Another beer!)
We're drunk, Jim Johnson put more in the trunk
Let it bump, 12 inch thump, pulling up to the southern club

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
It's a party
Oh oh oh (It's a party)
Oh oh oh oh (It's a party)
Oh oh oh oh (It's a party)
Oh oh oh oh (It's a party)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
Its B.o-bizzle in this bitch, somebody roll up a spliff
I got a big ol' bottle baby, come here here and get you a sip
Somebody must have told that girl that I be digging thick hips
And God must like big booties too, or else they wouldn't exist
Now somebody tell me what in the hell im gonna do with all that ass
I seen this girl she looked kinda cute, so i gave her 20 in cash
She winked her eye, she sat me down, she said "now just relax"
I said "you'll have to stand with that, if you dance you'll break my lap"
Damn, that thing can't be real, can it?
Got a nigga speaking Spanish, like no hablo English
Girl i ain't complaining, I'll keep making payments
If you keep that thing swanging by my way, damn it

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
It's a party
Oh oh oh (It's a party)
Oh oh oh oh (It's a party)
Oh oh oh oh (It's a party)
Oh oh oh oh (It's a party)
