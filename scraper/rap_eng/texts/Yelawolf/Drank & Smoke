[Intro: Yelawolf]
Yeah, what you got? what you got?
Milwaukee's beast we'll take that
Natty ice we'll take that shit, we'll take that shit too
PBR's we'll take that shit
Budweiser we'll take that shit too
What you got? Bud Light
Ah fuck it bring that shit too
What you got? 6's 12's 30's
Bring it all!

[Hook: Big KRIT]
We drank, we smoke, drank and we smoke
We drank, we smoke, drank and we smoke
We drank, we smoke, drank and we smoke
You can smell it on my breath
You can smell it on my clothes that we
We drank, we smoke, drank and we smoke
We drank, we smoke, drank and we smoke
We drank, we smoke, drank and we smoke
You can smell it on my breath
You can smell it on my clothes

[Verse 1: CyHi]
Catch me rolling up some medical
This shit here look like vegetables
I’m on that gas, I call it Texaco
I’m on that Cali not that Mexico
17 in the clip, I got that Plaxico
Roll a blunt while I’m driving, professional
I’m so high, I think I’m extraterrestrial
And your bitch is highly accessible
She seen my busting down the swisher sweet
With more chains on that Mr. T
She came here asked me can she hit the tree
But I notice that she came with a clique of freaks
She say she 24 just enrolled in grad school
I told her roll up, she said I’d be more than glad to
She on my cashews so I poured her a cup
Then she asked, can my girls have a glass too, because

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
I’m highed up, light up, and I’ve been that way since I po'ed that 4
Roll it up and let me smoke that doja even though I don’t smoke no more
Grip the wheel while I swang them bows, skyscraping on 24
Reserved the feeling, and bring it back some more
Can’t feel my head but my eyes are low
Gotta get to cloud 9, I got a couple more miles to go
They hear the weed outside, I never smelled this loud before
Got a bitch that love to suck and fuck
When she take shots she done had 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6 of them thangs
She get hella loud when we bang
Plus my neighbors always complain, cause I’m never sober
Pissing on the curb when I’m over could wait but the yard is just closer
Ain’t shit, I don’t give a fuck, and I don’t give a damn
They holler out the window are you thowed
I said, yes I am cause

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Mix it up with some hydrocodone and I’m off to the ozone
For the way, I’m gonna pack a no-doz
With a sack of old clothes get my rowboat on
Get the fuck out the dodge in my Charger
But I don’t need no phone cause I can’t call it
But I might need a cab to call home, cause I’m an alcoholic
Lick, lick, lick the stamp and send it
The address is college, 6, 6, 6, 6, with a kiss and the envelope and mail it
Have I been drinking tonight? Well, can’t you smell it?
I drown myself in whiskey like a fish I try to inhale it
Don’t need no P90X to get a 6 pack up on my stomach
It’s a goal of mine to hit the goal line with the SoCo and lime until I vomit
Make you party like a white boy, wake up and regret
Then relive it like you didn’t do it, the night before like you never said it
Motherfucker - Catfish Billy's never off his mojo
So you better put down that brandy, like you better off with no logo
Radio’s under a tree, that shady good music
Now put your straw with your cup and get fucked up in some just do it
Or just straight off a glass bottle that’s how troops do it
Got your bitches bitch on this shit, 2 scoops of fruit nuggets
And your 100 proof fluid, soaked in LSD, chew it
Now you want more, minus 2 of the 3 stooges
We drank, we smoke, it's me stupid
