[Raekwon]
Chill chill chill, let 'em rhyme, man
You know what it do man, just sit back, relax
Yelawolf what up?
Raekwon in the building

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
I'm Alabama's own, buddy
Flintstone Caprice, 1987 Cuddy
Backyard moonshine steel, methadone laboratory real
Can I keep it crystal clear
Chipped tooth type of people
Illiterate pigs who wanna see you killed type of evil
Confederate flags, I see 'em
On a truck with the windows down
Why is he playing Beanie Siegel
Cause his daddy was a dope man
Lynyrd Skynyrd didn't talk about moving keys of coke man
Ain't no such thing as a free bird
Billy's got that street work
And he's packing a nasty heater
Trailer home trap spot
Chevys on the cinder blocks
Still doing donuts in the gravel parking lot
Gold ropes, cousins in a group home
And he knows every word to every Yelawolf song, bitch

[Hook: Yelawolf & Raekwon]
I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop
I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that my shit gonna flop
Bitch your shit gonna flop
I wish a motherfucker would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop
I wish a motherfucker would
Hell, naw, I wish a motherfucker would

[Verse 2: Raekwon]
Now let me tell you somethin' youngsters
I'm never gonna sell you something
Unless it's that snow white
We might mail you something
Me, I'm straight raw hood with it
Be at your door quick
Four on your jaw, I gotta new lick
My clique a murderer niggas who love hip-hop
You fuck with Yelawolf and them niggas, your head goin' pop
I'm just sincere, fresh cut
All up in the leer, listen
Yo leave 'em alone, he brought me along
Rap, he got it, I'm the crew pilot
Flyin' trains, planes, automobiles: we bout it, bout it
Yo Wolf, I think they got you twisted flow
I got the biscuit on me spit in his face, I'm bout to piss on homie
Who dem niggas?
Just some Staten Island niggas
You could call us Shaolin
Where niggas get drunk
And hold me down my nigga
Yelawolf, Alabama's vandal
Scramble, this is the true ramble
Aye yo give 'em yo' handle though

[Hook]
I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop
I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that my shit gonna flop
Bitch your shit gonna flop
I wish a motherfucker would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop
I wish a motherfucker would
Hell, naw, I wish a motherfucker would

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
I appreciate it Rae
Sling shot me in quick
Like Talladega Motor Speedway
King shit, blue ribbon rap
Baking sodas on the kitchen rack
Chef what you need these fiends gotta itchy back
Get busy crack
I'll be in the cut just call me Mr. Is he back
And you don't gotta call my black, I got direction
I'm a road map I'm an almanac
I'm in awe of these hogs who call on rap to ball and brag
Fuck all of that, Wu-Tang's in Bama bitch
Get a grip handle it, Yelas in the revival tent
Vandalist, Evangelist daddies got the cannabis
Make a wish the candles lit, White boys follow this
Mamas thirty-aught-six, long-range hollow tips
Trashed off the glue you build an airplane model with
In the gutter like an empty PBR bottle is

[Hook]
I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop
I wish a motherfucka would
Tell me that my shit gonna flop
Bitch your shit gonna flop
I wish a motherfucker would
Tell me that I ain't hip-hop
Bitch you ain't hip-hop
I wish a motherfucker would
Hell, naw, I wish a motherfucker would
