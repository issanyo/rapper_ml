[Verse]
Yeah
Now Yelawolf is only getting funky
Ask Mommy I'm a fool come and laugh for me
Hit the fame wit' more soul than a sad junkie
This ol' cracker shit on rappers like bad plumming
It's overgrown but they couldn't hide my path from me
I'm in the truck you you shoulda' seen the white trash coming
Fuck A Bitch, I'm trash honey Walking With My Hands Pointed
At her throat Like A Mad Mummy lap suckas' around the track
Mash Money bank wads and paint jobs could get the cash from me
Treat everybody like a wall to a crash dummy jesus I mean that's
A call to the last coming a cheetah was never seen this fast running
Like I do rap hunny can't you hear the echo to the brass humming
I want it all I want the last something if there's something to be got
I want to get the got and leave the rats nothing and if the GOD, GOT
GOT by the last monkey I'm a gorilla the vanilla bean, that's hungry
Hungry enough to eat a burrito full of mayo and glass clumsy when I'm drunk off
Off a glass of brass monkey giving up is like giving my dad money
I'm better off giving up, cause I'll never see back the cash from em
Family values are a drag sunny, when you're from Alabama
Even grandma's lookin' for that fast money

Hello
Bootleg kev and yelawolf and we say
Howdy
How you doing out there
Hello
Can it be that it was all so simple
I'm sorry
Or does anyone even fucking care

And im back like a fuckin fetus between the knees of a cheetah
Killed by the coathanger, my throat rangled i breath in this mic
Reachin for credit but im really reachin for cleavage
From the bitch of the rap game i want milk, i won't believe it if you say i dont deserve im worth it, im worth adidas and gold chains and fedoras and all that come for the reason
To be a part of the leaders the preachers and money seekers
Thatll turn my project come into a fuckin platinum leaker, or gold at least come on i mean i'm not a golden retriever
But i receive the gold even if i win by a needle
The people winnin i see em i got em im on their heel, with the tank and a militia with a mission like Steven Siegel
Deceivin the sheeps illegal i need the sheep to be smarter, im a martyr but im not a creep you should know when you see the eagle
The script and the seven seagrams the sip and the shine is lethal, but a drunk bird in flights like a baby drivin a regal
But maybe the babys fright and my flight is only a piece of the story cause im not boring im an entertainer to the people
In your brain like i thought, im the prince to the Sheila cause Sheila's my momma, and this purple reign in my roof leaks to the bucket but fuck it all i fix roofs and i fix heaters
So i never stay cold for long im too strong im a two seater in a used beamer with a corvette engine on an empty street wit a nitrous tank but the night is blank and i got no high beams to see
But a high beam to me, is a jim beam high hi bean how ya be
