[Chrous: Yelawolf]
Return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
Away with the fakers, the players, the movers, the shakers surround y'all
Return of the guns that'll face to the days where the gangsters will stand tall
Return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
Yeah

[Verse 1: Struggle Jennings]
Father forgive me
I know that I was doing wrong but I grew up in a warm zone
No excuse tie a noose sing the high from the tree of life
I would probably go and do it twice
If I was in the same place
Came from the fire I know how the flame taste
Home from the pin
I would go again if it comes down to me or him
Forgive my sin amen
Fresh flowers for the virgin mother
Lights out say a prayer burn another mother fucker
Middle son I was born in a manger on the first name basis with the angels what up love
If I go to hell I kill the copo
Pearly gates like a ninja turtle life chopo
Return of the outlaw straight from the hollows
No looking back I'm prepared for what follows

[Refrain: Struggle Jennings]
Holy shit
Goddamn it
Mutha fuckas
Can't stand it
Holy shit
Goddamn it
Mutha fuckas
Can't stand it
Yeah, I'm back and I'm back with a purpose here to bring all the rash to the surface
Try to hold me down but it ain't workin
Stage is mine, time to close curtains

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
Away with the fakers, the players, the movers, the shakers surround y'all
Return of the guns that'll face to the days where the gangsters will stand tall
Return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
Yeah

[Verse 2: Struggle Jennings]
Goddamn it
How you gonna say that I ain't
I was birth from the canal lover saint
Hail Jimmy Lenn
Walk the same tracks where the killers been
Came from the same place that the sinners will west side
If I die tonight call it homiside
Just know that I die by my homies side
Man in the mirror clearer since I lost weight
Ties high ain't no way you can stop the wake
Heaven's sake
Say I'm hell bound
Couldn't stop the diamond nose as they fell down
I'mma pick em up slap em, give me 25
Stand up time to ride we ain't sittin by

[Refrain: Struggle Jennings]
Holy shit
Goddamn it
Mutha fuckas
Can't stand it
Holy shit
Goddamn it
Mutha fuckas
Can't stand it
Yeah, I'm back and I'm back with a purpose here to bring all the rash to the surface
Try to hold me down but it ain't workin
Stage is mine, time to close curtains

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
Away with the fakers, the players, the movers, the shakers surround y'all
Return of the guns that'll face to the days where the gangsters will stand tall
Return of the outlaw
Return of the outlaw
Yeah
