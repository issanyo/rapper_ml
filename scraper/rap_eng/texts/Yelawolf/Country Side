[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Somebody just told me that country music got a hold of hip hop
And everybody who want a piece of the rap game, suddenly got on the radio looking for hit spots
And you put LL Cool J on a new wave with this dude Brad Praisley
And I search for loop holes and you crazy
Who knows maybe the soup tasting even better that before it did
But if you're foreign to this
Dope game and big truck meets 808 and 36
Then fake a good look
Hell if I had a magic wand I'd put a boat on the river for you
Welcome to the mainstream and big bucks
Now paddle on, paddle on to Babylon
Rattle all snake, get a record to babble on
And travel on to the bricks, the lead that they tackle on
Musical vagabonds better learn how to swim
If the shit got deep, but you ain't gotta worry 'bout a hick like me
Killer Mike told me not to change my ways and my dixie flag was plain to see
Brotherhood, motherhood daddy's in the south better get a hold of this culture
Gotta be proud to be country, don't be a country vulture
Slumerican boss shit, better give me mine of the top I'm ripping
Alabama, Tennessee, G.A
All day motherfucker now let the beat drop, UH!

[Hook: Yelawolf]
I'm proud of my promise, papa's and all of my partners
We grew up in the bottom, bottom
Way down in the country side of things, yeahh
Way down in the country side of things, alright, alright, alright
Good people wanna have a good time
The south got enough problems
We just flipped a bottle to bottom
Way down in the country side of things, yeahh
Way down in the country side of things, alright, alright, alright

[Verse 2: Alexander King]
This shit here that outlaw hip-hop, gasolined out southern rock
From the east side of music city, I was raised on Skynyrd and Pac
What up Strug', what up slums, what up Dubbs, we're all showing love
Till they let you come home and we'll all make toast
Go on get this Highway Men shit on
There's so many false idols on thrones all singing that same old song
Bout their country roots and their cowboy boots, don't none of this shit feel true
Truth is a new south to the bone gristle
Hotter than my granddaddy's old pistol
Oh shit, gate keeper let us jump the gates
And the chances held we 'bout to pump the break
Say we ain't come from no problem
But if you make us in we gon' solve 'em
We came to celebrate all our partners
All the blessings, hard work and progress
To old south dying with our ancestors
Took what was left to rebuilt the system
If you feel me hands up high enough
Now sang this shit, "Welcome to the motherfucking country side of it."

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jellyroll]
This outlaw, Hip Hop, hell nah it ain't Hick Hop
Is what you got when you mix 'Pac with that 1997 Kid Rock
From the bottom I rose, to the top I came
But forgive me I think we celebrate
Write a record, let send it straight
I can never snitch and I never hate
Yeah girl, damn I'm fine
Grown man and I'mma handle mine
Everybody stressin', I'm just cool
Bitch I'm blown like a Dandelion
And I'm living it, I'm living it
The same way that I'm rapping it
Bad girl in my passenger, ridin' around trippin' out of this Maxima
Stayin' up late like I'm Dracula
Ridin' around serving all different packages
I'm carnival cruising
I swear this rapping happened by accident
I stand tall cause I had to fall
Left the streets and I had it all
The game's up and down like a basket ball
But I think I'm any day away from blasting off
And I'm gone

[Hook]
