Marijuana

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Twenty pounds in the trunk
Momma been growin' that skunk
Green room looks like a warzone
Dirty water drips from the hydro pumps
Daddy got me sweeping leaves
Pickin' up shake
Making tea, brownies, cookies
Serving all the hippies
Nickel sacks, bet hit me Dixie boy
Smoker's toy, paraphernalia, you enjoy
Grow it pack it then deploy
Summertime job, come get employed
Evidence destroyed, family biz evidently boy
Ducking in the police boy
All for the love of

[Hook: Yelawolf]
(Marijuana)
Growin' it up
Cut it down
Pack it up
Pass it around
Everybody loves some
(Marijuana)
Makes you happy
Feelin' stupid
Girls get horny
When they use it
Everybody smokes some
(Marijuana)

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Can't get caught by the Rosco
So we stuffin' this green like a taco
Feelin' like we hit a brick lotto
Putting dents in the street like a pot hole
We pot hold, in the backwoods
2 tone box Chevy with the black hood
Seats come out all packed up
P's for the 18 like a Mac truck
You a dope boy? So what
If I gave you my connect
You'd blow up
Sawed off layin' flat on the sofa
They'll twist that lid like a soda
Uncle Critter putting plugs on the motor
We gotta get to Tennessee no holdups
We ain't getting rich bitch
We getting over
All for the love of

[Hook: Yelawolf]
(Marijuana)
Growin' it up
Cut it down
Pack it up
Pass it around
Everybody loves some
(Marijuana)
Makes you happy
Feelin' stupid
Girls get horny
When they use it
Everybody smokes some
(Marijuana)

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Crowbar sits in the carjack
Fill the gas tank up with a fun pack
Son I don't wanna see you til' you come back
If you get caught, you know where the money's at
Throwing loose rocks on a dirt road
Police on your throat like a chokehold
Rollin' through town with a boatload
I'm feelin' like a trailer park mogul
Sweat can't roll down the windows
Cuz the doors jammed up with the elbows
I think I see cops, I can't tell though
If I ride too close, they'll smell dope
My phone blowin' up, I promise
They waitin' on the package from the runner
I made enough just for the summer
All for the love of

[Hook: Yelawolf]

Growin' it up
Cut it down
Pack it up
Pass it around
Everybody loves some
