Yeller
Hillbilly in Beverly Hills
And so Drama beats

[Verse 1]
Hold up, damn rich, peanut butter guts in the Lamborghini, woah
You must have white bread, lets make a sandwich
No I ain't never seen money like you got
Nobody got that kind of money in the boondocks
So if you take me up and show me the balcony looking over
The Hollywood valley I'll make your balloon pop
Popstars like you need a dude like me
To appreciate your wealth
I know you got a elevator in your house
But with me you'll appreciate the steps
Act like you don't wanna see how much of this Jack Daniels you can handle
You wanna drink and get cut like Rambo?
And let me drive your Daddy's Lambo

[Hook]
Take me up to Beverly Hills
To your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with Kim
Entertainment Channels
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?

[Verse 2]
You're young and reckless, nice little diamond necklace
Gotta pint-sized vodka drink and you're pretty in pink
Wanna go get breakfast?
But you ain't never been to Waffle House
Always hanging in Guys and Dolls
If you came to the South, I'd put you in the Chevrolet
And we'd slide to the mall
Yeah I came to the club in a pair of Famous jeans and a DTA hoody
But I'm walking through the party with Rogue Status looking for Beverly Hill goodies
Yelawolf and I'm an Alabama boy
Got more bounce than a salamander boy
Need a rich girl like I need a headache
But I'll take it if I can drive your Daddy's toy

[Hook]
Take me up to Beverly Hills
To your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with Kim
Entertainment Channels
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?

[Verse 3]
What you got in that tote bag
That one of a kind Prada
That beautiful behind inspires me
Makes one of my rhymes harder
Your daddy made a fine daughter
Make me wanna turn this wine from water
Keep the party going in the 808 blowing cause Drama made a beat that'll climb the chart up
Money, money, money, money, money
Ain't it funny what a honey in a Lamborghini will do
Some will run into a hundred dollar bill
And drill a dick on any Tom and Harry with a 24 inch shoes
But come and explore this dude
Analyze my swing
It's Slick Rick E. Bobby, baby
Gotta let me drive that thing, come on

[Hook]
Take me up to Beverly Hills
To your Daddy's mansion
Let me see Hollywood for real
Lights, camera, action
I've seen you partying with Kim
Entertainment Channels
One thing I gotta know
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?
Lambo-o-oh
Your Daddy's Lambo
Lambo-o-oh
Can I drive your Daddy's Lambo?

[Outro]
Just whip it around you know
Up the hills
I ain't gon wreck it, I promise
Just sit yo' drunk ass back
Drama Beats, Yelawolf, Ghet-O-Vision
What up Rob Dyrdek, Fantasy Factory bitch
