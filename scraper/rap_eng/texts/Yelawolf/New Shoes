[Intro]
Catfish Billy, Sweet Waste
And we got them, new shoes!

[Hook] x2
My Jeepers on the ground, my kicks are clean
Got original sound, hear Billy speed
Lookin at my, new shoes!
Talkin 'bout my, new shoes!
I'm walkin' in my, new shoes!
I'm flexin' in my, new shoes!

[Verse 1 - Yelawolf]
My shoes laces are loose
I run D in them see
I run beats and I clean
Hallways like a G
Excuse me, I mean J-
Anitors on the stage
I work for the school of hard knocks when I play
Yeah this ain't no softball, no under arm pitch
120 miles an hour, you haters swinging on this
You quitters swing and you miss
I'm striking out MVPS
My team is catchin pop flys
You pop fly literally
Literally I'm on point
My pencil's layin down words
You heifers munch on the field
And layin down on them turds
We might get crunk off a track
But we ain't backin' your move
Jesse Owens on the track
Check out my new shoes
If you can see 'em that is
Runnin and passin you by
Didn't see me passin now I'm posted on the far side
And your momma's got a peg leg
With a kick stand
I had to bring it back just listen to [?]
You heard!

[Hook] x2
My Jeepers on the ground, my kicks are clean
Got original sound, hear Billy speed
Lookin at my, new shoes!
Talkin 'bout my, new shoes!
I'm walkin' in my, new shoes!
I'm flexin' in my, new shoes!

[Verse 2 - Sweet Waste]
24 pairs [?]
Catfish Billy, Sweet Waste get the names right
Keep my wifeys disposable like white Tees
I might be the nicest motherfucker in Nikes
You got new shoes, fresh how you choose them
Creeping on the block late night you might lose them
So if you in my hood here be a few clues
Steppin [?] get stuck for ya new shoes

[Hook] x4
My Jeepers on the ground, my kicks are clean
Got original sound, hear Billy speed
Lookin at my, new shoes!
Talkin 'bout my, new shoes!
I'm walkin' in my, new shoes!
I'm flexin' in my, new shoes!
