[Intro: Yelawolf]
Willing to let you, getting to know you
What you really, really, really wanna hear
Willing to let you, getting to know you
What you really, really, really wanna hear

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
She's got a [?] with her
I wanna try staying with her
Look at Betty drinking Jack D by the shot
You have to play it cool 'cause you too damn hot
She's got a see-through dress on
Rocking them [?]
Burnt out Betty, you're the best shit out
Women are wicked, poised and posted
I see 'em everywhere, ass is glowing
They move primitive, oceans of sex
Drown it in lust, oh my goodness
Pardon me, I might be deep in my slumber
But if I'm not awake then I just leave you my number
Don't worry 'bout my pockets I don't have to show you that
Yelawolf'll get her done but don't front girl, oh no
(You can't do that)
What? I'm not

[Hook: Yelawolf]
Burnt out Betty drinking Jack by the fifth
Smoking cigarettes and she's [?]
She's got a see-through dress on
Rocking them [?]
Burnt out Betty is a late night lick
Look at Betty drinking Jack D by the shot
You have to play it cool 'cause she's too damn hot
She's got a see-through dress on
Rocking them [?]
Burnt out Betty, you're the best shit out

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Packet of Parliaments
Smoking the ceiling fan
I exhale though, they be just breathing in
You're all over there, I'm all over here
Let's meet up in between, make it a good year
Pardon me, I ain't talking 'bout tires
But you can get her done before the night expires
Don't worry 'bout my car I don't have to show you that
I'll steer the handlebars just grab by the gooseneck
You can't hide, we know where you at
[?] I love you for that
(You can't do that)

[Hook: Yelawolf]
But you're the burnt out Betty drinking Jack by the fifth
Smoking cigarettes and she's [?]
She's got a see-through dress on
Rocking them [?]
Burnt out Betty is a late night lick
Look at Betty drinking Jack D by the shot
You have to play it cool 'cause she's too damn hot
She's got a see-through dress on
Rocking them [?]
Burnt out Betty, you're the best shit out

[Bridge: Yelawolf]
Willing to let you, getting to know you
What you really, really, really wanna hear
Willing to let you, getting to know you
What you really, really, really wanna hear

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
What in your life? What do you have?
Is it a bump? Is it a [?]?
Do you get off when you're getting high?
Is it a hobby or your first try?
Pardon me, I don't mean to be obvious
But you [?] like a veteran, [?] than all of us
Don't worry 'bout my crib I don't have to show you that
She tapped on my shoulder and said "Where's the [?]"
(You can't do that)
Yes I can, yes I can
Because I like the burn out

[Hook: Yelawolf]
