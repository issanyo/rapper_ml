[Hook 1: Struggle & Yelawolf]
I,I-I Feel like
I been runnin' hard up with pain
I,I-I Feel like
I been working every day and night, like a sewing machine
Well maintained, heaven knows that I need the change

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yes I, Yes I
Got a pack of jelly worms on the dash fish sugar cane
The great white pinata is hangin' from the tree
And I got a big ol bat
No blindfold and I know that the targets set and I'm gonna hit it
When the sweets rain down I'm tell my people, "Look, y'all come and get it."
Got the digits on my phone set to the speed dial workin' for the dream
Star spangled banner grab me when it's on so I know when liberty rings
Could it be what it seems? No paddles in the southern city stream?
Beatin' to the creek but the saltwater calls like a sperm whale's scream
Know I learned well to sing. I was taught, I was bought, I was sold to compose music
Nose from the throat to the rope
That connects microphones to the folks
They pull me in, I pull ‘em out
It's my word, no doubt
Pay up or lay up
Time  off of your money cloud
God make it rain

[Bridge: Yelawolf]
Cause I been runnin' hard up with pain
And I been workin' every day and night, like a sewing machine
Well maintained, heaven knows that I need the change
Not only change that provides to my soul but the change that'll buy things

[Hook 1: Struggle & Yelawolf]
I,I-I Feel like
I been runnin' hard up with pain
I,I-I Feel like
I been working every day and night, like a sewing machine
Well maintained, heaven knows that I need the change

[Hook 2: Struggle & Yelawolf]
I,I-I Feel like
I been runnin' hard up with pain
I,I-I Feel like
Dale Earnhardt Jr
Doin the same thing that my daddy died doin’
Doin the same thing that my daddy died doin’

[Verse 2: Struggle]
I said Amigo, He said weddo
I said la coke-a, he say dinero
I said bueno He say bueno
I got up the next day and gayayo
Then I hit the strip with a nine
Young boy move a brick at a time
I need Antibiotics I’m sick of the grime
I’m so sick with the rhyme but the game needs amoxicillin
Thinkin’ back to the early 90's when pops was chillin
I feel like Dale Earnhardt Jr
Doin' the same thing that my daddy died doin'
And I'm reaching the same age that he reached when he died
Years way past due and I'm racin’ for time
So come meet a friend of mine
His words full of lies but he'll come through on time
I speak no Spanish and he speaks no Ingles
But we speak the same language, It's monay

[Hook 1: Struggle & Yelawolf]
I,I-I Feel like
I been runnin' hard up with pain
I,I-I Feel like
I been working every day and night, like a sewing machine
Well maintained, heaven knows that I need the change

[Hook 2: Struggle & Yelawolf]
I,I-I Feel like
I been runnin' hard up with pain
I,I-I Feel like

[Verse 3: Alex King]
Came from the bottom of a long list of folks who ain' make it out the trap
So don't ever wonder why I hit the highway
Never look back
Fuck format, matter fact, fuck the traveling, fuck crack
Every other dream they sold to us for the price of a little pack
Gettin' back for the hood y'all
That's what they sold me
Gotta do a little bad to earn good
That's what they told me
Show me so I turn around and showed my Homies
We could make a fuckin killing out here selling these OZ's
Not know the whole time, I'm sewing the same seeds
That's gonna grow up and be these same old shady ass trees
That's keeping you and me from
Being what we could really be
Instead of what we see on youtube MTV
Truth is the internet got us thinking that whole world’s a rumor blog
Real truth been waitin’ for us on Zeitgeistmovie dot com

[Pre-Hook: Alex King]
I,I-I Feel  like
We been lied to
Did a little soul searching came back with a whole pound of the truth

[Hook 1: Struggle & Yelawolf]
I,I-I Feel like
I been runnin' hard up with pain
I,I-I Feel like
I been working every day and night, like a sewing machine
Well maintained, heaven knows that I need the change
