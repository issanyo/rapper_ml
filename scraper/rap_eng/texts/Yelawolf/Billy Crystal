[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Trailer park's on fire, Billy been cookin' up somethin'
If you need a biscuit, come on then
Billy has got it jumpin' get it from a pro
Get it for the low, get you some blow
Get it for the nose, get it for the show
Get it for the hoes, four wheeler cranked up
Gas tank on the ATV
It's full of that crank but, Billy got pills from A to Z
So what do you think bud, Billy won't go below fifty
Twenty-two's are dangerous
Drink a finger with the nugget rings
Pow, take one from the needle, how you feelin' now
Purple moons and lucky charms, yeah that's the sound
Of veins turnin' brown, but his fame is so profound
His name is like a noun, they going Billy now

[Refrain]
Billy's on the corner with the Crystal Meth
And he ain't slowing down, slowin' down
Billy's on the corner with the Crystal Meth
Go Billy
C-c-c-c-Crystal Meth

[Verse 2]
Hello junkie and hello Momma too
Hello to my P.O, deuce up to the boys in blue
Billy got brass balls
Twenty pounds on the catwalk
LSD and Adderall
And LCD's on the wall
He's watchin' every move
High-tech Redneck
Run up on him if ya want to
I bet redneck, c'mon
It might be dark in the woods
But the lights are on
The money's counted
And if the price is wrong
Well then Billy will get them Gremlins like Spielberg
He'll take your house down, off of them pillars
And take your Mom to Sizzler
And feed her chicken liver
That's cold blooded love
Billy's a chiller

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
4:30 in the A.M
Billy ain't slept for days
Gotta keep up with the profit
Gotta keep up with the craze
It's a heavy shade
Gotta walk through the maze
Down where the sun don't shine
And the pine trees sway
And when the wind blew
And the cradle fell
Down come baby Billy
And up come an able male
Momma stayed at work
Daddy stayed in jail
Hey that's a full deck
But ya gotta play with what your dealt
So Billy dealt the joker
Put the sheriff in a choker
He drank himself sober
And pissed in a Super Soaker
And he wet 'em all up
And left his snow yellow
That's hard White Boy
For the L O

[Refrain]
