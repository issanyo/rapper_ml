[Verse 1]
I've never been the type to walk away from fun
I had a dream, I had a dream like everyone
I've seen your smoke and mirrors and dirty smoking guns
It makes me wanna run away into the sun
Into the sun
Into the sun

[Chorus]
Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul from LA
Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul from LA
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh

[Verse 2]
I snapped some photographs and threw them to the sea
Palm trees and party cups all filled with misery
My love is candy red and breaking constantly
My heart is scared to death
Yeah, of the california dream
California dream
California's dream

[Chorus]
Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul from LA
Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul from LA
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh
Save me from LA
Save me from LA
Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul from LA

[Bridge]
No, I don't wanna lose my mind (ooh)
But if I stay here, I will die
I've seen God on Hollywood and vine
Money passes me everytime

[Chorus]
Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul from LA
Save my soul, save my soul
Take me far away
Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul from LA
Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul from LA
Save me from LA
Save me from LA
Save my soul, save my soul
Save my soul from LA
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh
Woo, ooh
Save me from LA (Woo, ooh)
Save me from LA
