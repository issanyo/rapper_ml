[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
Livin' my life in the rear view and I'm haunted by
My past and sometimes I just wanna die (die)
I need to change my ways (ways), mama, I'm gonna try (try)
But that's a lie 'cause you heard me say that a thousand times
I say Lord please help me
'Cause I've been living unhealthy
And the life that I've been livin' Lord (livin' Lord)
Can I really be forgiven for?

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause it glitters doesn't mean it's gold
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna let the truth be told
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I'm about to lose my self control (control)

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
And they ask me how I'm feelin'
I'm somewhere between Hendrix and Robin Williams
Hide behind the tears of a clown (clown)
And the sound (sound), of silence (silence), it seems so loud (so loud)
Would you just look at me now
When I take a shot of Crown and wash this Percocet down
Played the victim for too long to justify my habits
Knowing everything I touch turns tragic (tragic)

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause the glitters doesn't mean it's gold
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna let the truth be told
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I'm about to lose my self (Struggle) control (control)

[Verse 3: Struggle Jennings]
I guess I'm narcissistic 'cause I'm tryin' to get it
Am I being selfish attemptin' to rid my life from the drama in it
See it was harder comin' home than goin' in
Hard to understand that statement unless you came from where I've been
Why is it difficult to do right but so easy to sin
Findin' peace in losin' to move on from the chaos of the win
That demon in the mirror is still the saint that he portrays
So the songs of tomorrow borrow sorrows from today

[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause it glitters doesn't mean it's gold
And I don't wanna hurt nobody
I just wanna let the truth be told
I don't wanna hurt nobody
But I'm about to lose my self control (control)

[Outro: Jelly Roll]
And I don't wanna let you go
I think about you now everywhere I roll
Somewhere down the road, I lost my soul
And I know 'cause it glitters doesn't mean it's gold
