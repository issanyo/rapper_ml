[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yelawolf and I feel like a king in my box Chevy
Tell them other wack muthafuckas to get they pine box ready
Catfish Billy is deadly, don't get slapped with the medley
Still sippin' on Jack D to my neck and my head start feelin' heavy
Doin' one-twenty five down I-29
Really think I need to start slowin' down
But I can't 'cause I got a pretty little blonde thing
Sittin' to my right that's blowin' me now
Oh yeah, she's headin' me
I think her name might be Becky
I was about to drop her off
But I had to switch lanes to get the brain she begged me
Aww naw, do you come in twos?
Please choose a couple of friends that could hop in and cruise
Now we goin' steady, but I'm not lookin' for longevity
Pipes in the back, the lights of the night reflect sights through the dash, I'm nice to ride pass

[Hook: Yelawolf]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin' low, to the side I lean
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy

[Verse 2: Rittz]
Fuck a limousine, I'd rather ride Caprices
My speakers vibrate the concrete beneath us
Ridin' 85 northbound, shakin' doors down
So I turn the speakers louder, pissin' off polices
Fuck a five-star chick, got a pornstar bitch
Ridin' shotgun with me, gettin' so wet
Now she goin' down on me givin' roadhead
Bussin' on her forehead then I take her back to the homestead
Peace, back in the Caprice took a sack of weed
And crumpled it inside a cognac blunt wrap
Then it's time to jump back on the highway 85
Slumpin' in my seat like I'm hunchback
And my Chevy lookin' so dope
Old school Vogues on it got it floatin' like a rowboat
Gold flakes in the candy paint drippin' on the road
Drivin' slow like a mothafuckin' showboat, ho
Don't act like you don't hear me comin'
I got the Willis Drummond and it's comin' out the clarion
Twelves in the trunk, flatscreen TVs in the headrest with Something About Mary on, carry on
I be turnin' heads every time when you see me in the Chevy
Man, it's evident she car-struck
And I'm far from hard up so quit trippin' like a bitch
And get in the car, slut, girl you know you wanna ride

[Hook: Yelawolf]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin low, to the side I lean
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy

[Verse 3: Yelawolf] (Only on Trunk Muzik 0-60)
In the background with a six-pack now
And I’m out lookin' for the ladies
Peanut butter seats, have seat girl my peanut butter needs jelly
I'll chase you like Chevy, if you ain't afraid to get messy
If you know the game then I'll let you call the shots like a referee
Now I’m drinkin' a deuce deuce, swig it slow
Feelin like I’m Deuce Deuce Bigalow
Pick a bitch like I pick a piccolo
Go anywhere you wanna go, pick a road
Interstate 59, 20, 75, 285, 85 southbound
Twins pipes like pow-pow
Hundred spokes on the Vogues like wow, wow, wow

[Hook: Yelawolf]
My wheels are super clean, paint job it glitters and gleams
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
Tilted off Jim Beam, sittin' low, to the side I lean
And I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
This whip is built for queens and you wanna be seen with a king
Well I wanna see the back of your jeans in the seats
My box Chevy
