Though many have come there will never be another one quite like... YELA

[Hook]
ROCK!
Everybody get the fuck up
ROCK!
Everybody get the fuck up
ROCK!

[Verse 1]
Yeah he gonna pop that trunk
Yeah battleship sunk, throwing dirt clock chunks, sling shot rocks
Broke no money lumps, looking at the d-boys with the petty dunks
Slick sit down you ain't in the city chump special K make the kitties come
Get ya some, get plenty guns move em' out
Ten toes down, pity none
Get cha' ya' own dixie, wonâ€™t give a dog a bone
Sittin on bigger chrome yeah that's home
Bird fight pit fight what a good song looking at the world like "what I do wrong"?
Nothin but a mailman truck comin back for the pick up
I'm the gift you can't get rid of
Recline on me hommie I'm a make you sit up
Get drunk do it, stage lights are lit up scream like...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let the beat ride like that
Yeah I'm a thunderbird never comin' back
Thunder in the trunk thunder in the dope sack
I serve em up thunder in the dope rap's BOOM!
Big lacs in the tall grass sit with the tires flat
Real good price buddy you should buy that...
Blink and you might pass my town
Hole in the wall, king "my crown"
O but of all things my sound
Is pickin up like a thirty mile long train
Slow climb up but such a long reign
So how did I become wolf? pick of all names
What a fairy tale like Ichabod Crane
The headless horseman runnin untamed like...

[Hook]
