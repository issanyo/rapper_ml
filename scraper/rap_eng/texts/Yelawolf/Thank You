[Verse 1]
Look at these haters switch a switch
Used to get sick to see me whip
Now they light us up, they flick a Bic
Pick a brick, tell me to suck a dick
Now they choke on the crack I got
When the crack I rock's on a bumping clit
Get done if you think I forgot that shit
Reaching your hand out for a dap like we're cool
I just laugh at it
I wouldn't backhand slap that shit
But I got a block of broken glass
You can use your dap to pack it with
Mad at Yela because you lack the wit
Catastrophic motherfuckers mad at this catalyst
Cause I catapult outta holes
Out of vice grip hoes
No tules in a toolbox to tighten up the bolt, loose screws
I'm going A to V to monkey wrench to you
I'm losing weight fucking these bitches, oh you too
Faggot you're lying I remember you
Use to throw away the paper
Now you're treating me like the new news

[Hook]
Well you can love me now
Scared that I might come down
Like a bad dream
What goes around comes around
So turn the ground upside down
And welcome me
Thank you, fuck you
Thank you, fuck you
Thank you, fuck you
Cause now you see it
Thank you, fuck you
Thank you, fuck you
Thank you, fuck you
For not believing

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm under the underdogs house
No wonder the younger poured clowns
All the got is dogs now
And here comes a wolf like a shot in the dark
Blindfolded from 'Bama, aiming at nothing at all
Only to let the bullets fly for my minds eye
Bears, tigers and lions, pussies better have nine lives
But leave the woods alone like a two wheel drive
When he stuck face in the heel, then the steel covered it, ah
Yes I do need to trouble you
Still doing it for the dirty, the Chevy boxes and bubbles too
Vision blurring I'm stirring southern stew
Curving ho serving canister, I'm canning cancer; the shut up juicy
Hypemen can't [?] in you
Thank March that it ain't hot so you can see this bitch I'm chewin' through
That's what the Ricky Bobby ruler do, ruin you like 2 and 2
Is just 4 motherfucker

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Ohh I'm an asshole now, huh?
I'm acting funny, I'm chancing, I'm Hollywood
I'm on that gas, huh?
But guess who's standing at the gas pump
You with an empty tank and a hand out, damn punk
Been a while since we had a conversation
Of course I'm actin' distant
You say I'm strange that's a proper statement, stranger
You came up out of your chamber when you heard that I got a roll
And now you're casting like an angler
But the Chevy plates read 'danger'
Breaks pumping the pumps and the window
Like a closet with an empty hanger
Just waiting for a chat, get so obvious you on a hang just like it
On a pole in between my clothes
Studying my wardrobe poor soul, but the door is closed
Didn't think you could go more low
After booing me at my show you're pursuing me like a ho

[Hook]
