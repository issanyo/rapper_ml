[Verse 1: Ounze Zilla]
When the hammer hits the pin
U can't duck, So u mother fuckers better put your hands up, u hate the Phoenix room illa, come & get the Killa from a known drug dealer, all my life been plantin seeds, been down on my luck but now I'm back on my feet, now days my grass is greaner money back if there's seeds in the diesel. Reapin the benifits of a fruit from a crop, grown up in the attic up under kilowatts, new city next show new watch, coast to coast and then back to the block, outside the box, Thinkin over night flights and private stocks, tell her get it wet than ride my cock, I'm Thinkin of money when I'm lookin up at the clock, hustle hard for the ends I'm bout to get, I'm livin now growin old with no regrets, really wanna do it, don't talk just kill em, I ain't hard to find bitch, @1zilla, get the "K" with the hell fire n I ride out, send a hundred 7.6.2's thru your hide out, killin the witness's so the cops don't find out so fly on the rise, sky bound.. I used to be Thinkin bout makin money of the books, now I'm handlin bussiness I graduated from a crook I don't have no patience, or idle time to be wasting, get to the money thru navigation in my space ship, I don't wanna talk bitch loop my beat wipin the fingerprints off of 223's, I'mma felon already still gotta pay my lease, I'm tryin to figure whose watchin m who moved my cheese..

[Hook: Drum Major]
All of my life
Planted seeds
In the spotlight I'm gonna be
Now we're up so high outter space
Satellites
Get up, get up, get, get up, get up, get down

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Catfish..
Pray for the people, pray for the people
Yea motherfucker I'm awake and illegal-ly
Drivin' a Caprice in the streets, you better stay on the sidewalk cause I'm evil
When I take a sip of Jack, I'm an eagle
Soarin' thru the club like I don't see you
Yea whatever, its nice to meet you, fuck you, I don't really care or need you
To be a fan, or shake my hand, or tell me I'm the man cause I'm off the needle
Cause I brought a earthquake to the birthplace of Jay-Z & the Village People
New York never seen me comin'
Cops in the park never seen me runnin'
Treat a rapper like a pussy hole, fuck 'em all, fuck 'em raw
Yea, I don't even need a woman, no homo
Clowns jumpin' up out they cars for me, go Bozo
Had to get it all for myself, cause nobody was ready to stand up I go solo
Used to be where them hoes don't go
Now they wanna roll, and I'm like "No ho"
Oh no bitch, better get a dildo, better yet, pull a dollar out your bill-fold
What you got on my gas?, I mean for real
I'm a dirty whiteboy rollin' wit a buncha' whiteboys in West Nashville
That's real, that's real, that's still my roots
And I got mud still on my boots
And I might walk into your livin-room, steal your broom
And leave my tracks for proof, the track is proof

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Struggle]
No poker face, I'll show you what card I play, do u really wanna see what's up my sleeve besides my Cartier, it's hard to say what you would do on my block, u couldn't walk in my shoes so why the fuck you wearin my socks, my team has been here, my people are pioneers, now I'm surrounded by a buncha fake smiles, veneers, that Lear jet still isn't here yet, they runnin blind cause they can see that ima clear threat, put your hands up, bubba this a stick up
Ima breath of fresh air... Hick up
No pick up, miss us with that okie doke
Outlaw till I croke your heart is softer than an artichoke, I'm okay buddy, I can buy my stake, cause when this cheddar comes I don't want you eatin off my plate, I'm not irate I just take pride in my shattered life, I'm up so high you can not see me, Satellites
