[Verse 1]
I left my family at home
To go and sing my song
I know the music pays the bills y’all
But I still feel wrong

[Bridge]
Baby I’m doing the best that I can yes I am
And I catch myself running everytime
Really only fall behind
That’s why I gotta just rewind

[Hook]
Take it easy
There’s no need to speed
Slow it down
Take it easy

[Verse 2]
Baby what’s wrong?
Are you alright?
I’m only here for a few days
Let's make it a good night

[Bridge]
Baby you’re doing the best
That you can, yes maam!
If you catch yourself running sometimes
Take a breath and recline that he loves you
Just rewind

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I’ve been around
I’ve had my back to the wall
But it’s a humble inexperience
To find that I haven’t been through nothing at all

[Bridge]
Cause even when you doing the best
That you can, you can die
If it don’t matter, leave it behind
Leave your family, your time and your love
And just rewind

[Hook]

[Outro]
There’s no need to rush, slow it down (repeats), take it easy (echo)
There’s no need to speed, no need to rush, hurry up, slow it down
