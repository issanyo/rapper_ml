[Intro]
What's up world?
The name is Yelawolf
You might not know me by now
But, umm...
Maybe soon you will
You know what I'm sayin'
And when you see my on the street
Want you to throw your hands up like this
Throw a peace up in the air and say
Dare he go, yeah

[Chorus]
If you see me in the Box
Chevy with the hubcap spokes at the spot
Smile n' say:
Dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go
[?] the clothes that I rock
Hit me 'cause I'm clean and my kicks are hot
Yeah, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go

[Verse 1]
Supermax black pat cat, {pussy} eater
Boogie hip shaker, hot rap paper getter
Bird feeder, did it all for the nookie beater
Rita in the backseat and see I'm finna please her
Been a heater since I was a little verse breather
Strong breeze, sharp, used to get the babysitter
Momma slip, don't trip, 'cause I like to hit her
Man-child'll ride a bicycle to go get her
Taught me well, now I limp harder
Dude, the last girl I shanked flipped and bought me a cell
Walk a frail bridge but I jump up and down like a Celtic
And you can't kick my hound around, 'cause he's a pale mix
I was down before I ever learned to rap
Pickle breath, bare-footed, wrong side of the tracks (the ghetto)
Rap shooting, bark peeling, {weed} crop snatcher
Good herb holder, soap through the hole blower

[Chorus]
If you see me in the Box
Chevy with the hubcap spokes at the spot
Smile n' say:
Dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go
[?] the clothes that I rock
Hit me 'cause I'm clean and my kicks are hot
Yeah, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go

[Verse 2]
Skip froggy style to the shack like that
Cherokee, eagle feather, jelly peanut butter
Leaf cutter, gutter splitter, sticks to the bricks
Tornado spitter, hit the storm cellar
Wanna dance? I'm a TD maker, I'm a tipi shaker
I'm an easy baker, get 'em hot quick
Slick, vaseline, water rippling when it drop
Watch me fly, more than 5′2″, snatching doo doo
YelaWolf got the clan in a bloody noose
Controversy and I know it I'll bless a poet
Or mess up in it when it gets done holler for me
Get a pack of this, man what type of cracker this?
Saltine your game that type of cracker this
Never that, show ‘spect, native Ameri-who?
Ameri-can "I think I can" up the track dude (what? what?)

[Chorus]
If you see me in the Box
Chevy with the hubcap spokes at the spot
Smile n' say:
Dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go
[?] the clothes that I rock
Hit me 'cause I'm clean and my kicks are hot
Yeah, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go

[Verse 3]
Hold up, single solitary dry flows
Pop glows collar flicking, never follow chickens
Marshmallow cookin', long line fish hookin'
Sloppy walkin', faded out, fresh crappy cookin'
Cheap beer drinkin', talk loud, breath stinkin'
Step limpin', wet drippin' from the lip lickin'
Split banana pickin' ball, grabbing bull, stabbin'
Indian trail wagon, little boy laggin'
Middle-man, half-breed, don't claim a color
I put graffiti on the stars of the spangled banner
Tangled grammar, Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama
Vision blurs, see my fur dressed liked a panda
And I put art on my body parts
Full time rhyme dart throwin' at your car
Beep, beep, beeps in the trunk
Yelawolf load it up, click click dump

[Chorus]
If you see me in the Box
Chevy with the hubcap spokes at the spot
Smile n' say:
Dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go
[?] the clothes that I rock
Hit me 'cause I'm clean and my kicks are hot
Yeah, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go
If you see me in the Box
Chevy with the hubcap spokes at the spot
Smile n' say:
Dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go
[?] the clothes that I rock
Hit me 'cause I'm clean and my kicks are hot
Yeah, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go, dare he go
Yelawolf
Dare he go
