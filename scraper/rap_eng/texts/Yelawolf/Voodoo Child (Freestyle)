Well, I'm a voodoo chile
Lord I'm a voodoo chile

[Yelawolf]
Tell me ouija board, who's peaking in my window again?
Couldn't be Peter Pan cause he's got a fuckin' evil grin
The ouija board's spelled out E-V-I-L twin, C-A-T-F-I-S-H
Billy that's you again
Fucking right I'm coming out to play, Michael you should bow and pray
Look up to the sun and blind yourself cause Iâ€™m The Bible Belt, only want to relate
To the Michael that you want to fight
But it ain't really gonna pay off because that fucking outlaw inside you's gonna get ya either way
Now be the porta-potty for the order
Obviously your the sort of kind of warrior the border probably don't want to let through the door
Cause all the commonal' is that you're poorer to the poor and overworked
Bodies singing out the story they can all be proud of
But the sound of power showers over louder speakers in the boring hip-hop court lobby. (Uh)
I'm a super freak, Rick James bitch, you can do for me
I take a 9 smoke ya man and drop him off with a lighter down on hookah street
I'm everything you could be, make you MC read his elegy while I pull my zipper down behind a tree
Man somebody died here, "Yela', you can pee?" Yep!
I don't care bout a grave on a hater
Hater I don't care if I don't pay when I enter places, if it's a million people waiting to enter
Fuck a VIP I want to see a stage and listen to no roast
Just a wave of a bunch of renegades in a blaze, just place me in the center
I'm sicker than a hick up in the heat with syphilis and hepatitis sucking on a pipe like head of lice and plus survivors that can't be identified
It's probably better that you grab a sweater
Better yet a leather jacket from a closet rack
And maybe get a pack of antibiotics for the psychotic hi-fi phonics that I share
Cause there's a catfish breathing air
There's not two, there's not a there
That's not a day, that's another year
That's another ball park all together Frank
Got a fake gold No Limit's tank
And a loaded 45 pointed at the pitcher
Motherfuckers wanna play a pickup game?
Bones hit the strands
I'm so on my own shit that I won't quit
I'm so on my own out here that I can't quit
If you quarrel leaving, paint it, and grenade the gains in the ground of the shameless Hollywood
Fuck bodies bang this in your church
You can sang with me it's free
Styles I got piles, flows I got miles
Show I got crowds, hoes I'm not proud
Open your mouth, slow leaking out, love you a beer
Towels on the floor, vowels on the floor
Grounds on the floor, now you record? Loud as a boar
Wow what a boy, look in the mirror
I say today is the day that I wake up and walk outside
And the entire globe turns bright purple just by popping this little pill here, ya dig?
I'm the reincarnate of a Vietnam vet. chasing a gook through the jungle
With a mind like a tumble-weed, blood shot eyes, and I'm chewing on a twig
My late great grand daddy fed me pepper and told me it was chocolate
He must of known I need some spice in life, I was too big for this piece of shit town
You try putting a dream inside a box, that box would implode
Dilapidate, evaporate, desaturated with sound
For the folks in the back of the broken Volkswagen, parking the bug in the parking lot and rolling baggies
Walking around the festival, then profiting off the these people yearning, burning
For that LSD, for the lettuce head in me
I give you most props if you grow crops
Keep your tie-die and flip flops
Yippee-ki-yay if you don't stop. (Don'tstop)

[Jimi Hendrix]
And at the same time I'm right here in your picture frame
Yeah! What did I say now
Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows, I'm a voodoo chile

(Guys come on)
