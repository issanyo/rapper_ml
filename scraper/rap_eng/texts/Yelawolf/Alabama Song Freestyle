[Bridge]
Billy's in the backseak drunk hangin' out of that
Window of a rusty dump
Cigarette butts in the floorboard, honey and
Another 30 pack in the trunk

[Verse 1]
And I'm covered in tattoos
Step in this pocket, my #2 pencils and shoes
Fruit of the fuckin' loom, boa constrictor boots
Mow up your fuckin' lawn with an '82 vehicle
Put premium gas in a medium glass
Chug it, spit fire, then laugh at a helium mask
Y'all could't fuck with the verse if you rehearsed the diss
6 months later and gave it to DJ Drama for horn stabs
I don't battle, I war
I'm from the country where dope dealers run the rap game
Shit, fuck I'mma battle for?
I ain't with that bullshit, I ain't no matador
I'm MCA tapes, 808s, rattlin' floors
I'm an AK, love, hate, I'm a catalyst for
Crackers who act a rabbit and jump when I crack in the door
Speaking of act a rabbit, y'all ready know who I'm wit
I don't know why you're still acting unsure, shit
I feel like slappin' these whores
Shut up loser, you're stupid
Reach in that cooler and grab me a Coors
It don't matter if you mad that I'm more
Badder and more savage than these other rappers before, cuz
Of my style of clothes, my path and a past record
Bitch suck a sack of shit while I stack up a sack of awards
Internet goons they beg and they cry and they bitch and they moan
But this is what I see when they ride...

Let me do you a fuckin' favor...

[Verse 2]
And it's syanora, bye-bye
And I'm on a higher floor you're gonna need to provide
A picture, ID to sit with messiah's boy in the sky
An ancient mayan convoyage through portals and not arrive
To this door in my mortal mind
Tom Sawyer in the divine
Took four years under the vines
Developed a greater grape and then poured you a glass of wine
Now drink the unthinkable
Put a flame to the tip of that joint and smoke the undreamable
Cause me being who I am is nothing less than a shrink and
Two angels, two demons, a preacher whose leanin'
A prophet, a mystic and they all twisted, jerkin off
A cup and to mention the semen
Nine months later, me and my momma playin' peek-a-boo
You play with me, I'll put a sheet to use
And I ain't talkin klan, I'm talkin meat and boot
Drop a hot verse and a hot deuce
And kick that shit up the street, literally
Bitch, you can eat the shoe
My soul is sad like my old dad
I'm muddy waters infused with Rude Jude's old cold ass
So, drugs make me happy, I'm an alcoholic
Who fell in the shallow end of a swimming pool holdin' a fatty
No Kevin Bone, but that blunt was bone dry
Cuz I held that bitch in the sky
I ain't sacrificing no high
In the hospital with a couple of fuckin' stars
And the first thing I said in that fuckin' car was

[Sample: Jim Morrison]
Well show me, the way to the next whisky bar
Oh don't ask why [x2]
Show me, the way, to the next whisky bar
Oh don't ask why [x2]
For if we don't find the next whisky bar
I tell you we must die [x2]
I tell, I tell, I tell you, we must die

[Outro]
