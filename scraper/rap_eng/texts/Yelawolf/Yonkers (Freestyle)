Yeah, It's Yeller
What's up Slumdon?

Ugh
Shady Records
Fits me better than 80's leather
Better than Biz Markie in a baby sweater
With Eminem on 8 mile
Naw I'm better off
See that makes me Cheddar Bob, With a better job
And I'm after Cheddar Bob's hits and Hailie's wish
But I ain't shooting myself in the dick
I been in the works
GOD had a plan ya
Shoulda known when EM freestyled over Sweet Home Alabama
I'm overseas, But I'm over playing
There's nothing to play with when your sharing a bus
With Wiz Khalifa's catering
Tossing and turning in my bunk, Trying to cheer up
But I can't sleep, That's why they call it EUROPE
Cheerio chap, Cheerio mate
You try eating cheerios, Cereal off a plate
UGH, Okay I'm lying I'm great
And you should feel safe, Cuz the lion has ate
Yeah mayne
Get it?
Lion, Mane, My slangs, Joe Dirt, DANG
If I ain't one of the greatest
My President is white, and Muslims love bacon
Puff Daddy is broke, and the baby's got --
When its trying to soak breast milk from fake tits
And I got more stories than Forrest Gump
Half of them I experienced in a slump when I was poor and drunk
But crack another 5th and pour it up
Cuz I'm bored as shit with these rappers
SHADY, There is no more of us, So act like you in some sort of rush
Yelawolf is in town, I'm drinking brown now
ORDER UP
Radioactive November 21st
Radioactive November 21st
Tim Westwood said "Hey, give me a shirt that says
Radioactive, November 21st"
Yeah go to church, semtex go to work
Go deez nuts, Go crazy, Go berserk
Yeller
