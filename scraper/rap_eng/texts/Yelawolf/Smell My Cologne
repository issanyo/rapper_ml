[Speak: Pimp C]
So if you want it man, come on with it
If you want it with me come one and get some
'Cause you going to smell my cologne
Issey Miyake or some Bond No. 9
'Cause I do not play

[Intro: Big HUD]
Long live Pimp C, first born on the beat
(Ghet-O-Vision)
Da Heavyweight that’s me
Ey we miss you my nigga
This is for you dawg, let’s go!

[Hook: Big HUD] x2
You gon’ smell my cologne
(what?)
You gon’ smell-you gon' smell my cologne
(I know you smell me nigga)
You gon’ smell my cologne
Issey Miyake or some Bond No. 9

[Verse 1: Big HUD]
I’m the shit, bitch
I know you smell me, I already know
You ain’t even gotta tell me
I’m young and living the crazy life
I pray to god every night
Asking him to hold me down
Cause these niggas be acting [?]
And my ice is a bitch
And I’m ballin’ in the mist
Different cities everywhere
Probably fucking with yo bitch
You’re a snitch, I’m a dawg
You’re a ho, I’m a hawk
I’m 2,45 nigga, six foot tall
And everything that I do
I do it for my city
Dallas, Texas motherfucker
The home of the killers and the G’s
[?], the OCT
I’mma rep it till I die, motherfucker look at me
Cause yeah I’m a G, catch me in dollar D
Huffin to club and poppin’ bottles
Yeah we blowing tree
We blew a couple G’s
We with a couple freaks
They can tell that we on
Bitch, smell my cologne

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I got 22 ice cold in the hand
With 22 white hoes in the van
Sippin’ on Milo, Alabama hello
Yeah buddy I’m proud of Malay
Everybody know that and
Still people wanna run around me
Like I’m [?]
Or disrespect one of my beats
Bitch up, like I don’t know what I’m doing
Like I don’t drive a Chevy
Like I didn’t grow up ruthless
I’m from the Bible Belt
So I know what the bit truth is
And my truth is bit, now straighten me up bitch
Call me prof (holler at chee)
I never was the type, to walk around looking for good advice
I walked around like a bullet trapped in a titanium box all of my life
Put your [?] hand inside, and draw back [?]
I come from a long line of dime pushers, Paul pack it up
I can’t afford to live like a [?] before I sit at home
And let one of you bitch motherfuckers
That throwing threats keep me from blowing
Cause Trunk Muzik put my family in a new home
Take a whiff of them bowties, bitch
Smell my cologne

[Hook]

[Bridge 1: Big HUD]
Bend and break you girl around with me [?]
Come to town motherfucker (I do not play)
Everytime I come around
Yeah you know it’s going down motherfucker (I do not play)

[Bridge 2: Big HUD]
[?]
We had to take these boys to church on Islam
What up [?]? What up Kawan ‘KP’
And they can smell my cologne

[Hook]
