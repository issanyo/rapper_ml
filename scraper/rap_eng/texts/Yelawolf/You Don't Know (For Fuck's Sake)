[Intro: Yelawolf]
For fuck's sake, yeah
Yelawolf, Melody Man

[Verse 1: Ed Sheeran]
Living the life of a student, yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind and they say that I’ve been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight and never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad with a ten in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
'Cause I've hidden my pride, giving the time
To write rhymes but I find truth at a quarter to five
Hey!

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
It’s kinda like I took a train to the left side of my brain, oh, mayne
Puddles of mud, under my love, you know I’m stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Pardon me while I get down, down, down
Making you get up and say...

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If you don’t know
If you don’t know by now, you better tell him ’bout it
What you gonna tell him ’bout? Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Ten toes to the dirt, pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink, drink a pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels, I’m a ridah, steel ring, no Prada
Only thrift clothes and my ada-di-das
I’m a fetus in my room, say na na
Daddy’s home, on the mic, hey papa

[Verse 4: Ed Sheeran]
Back with a bang yo, straight loop pedal, no band though
But every single one of my fans know
That every damn show I’m taking their ears on a journey
Like I’m flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin’ so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics 'cause they think I’ve been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes, rocking a Kangol
I’m riding 'round with Yelawolf in your daddy’s Lambo

[Verse 5: Yelawolf]
Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You’re probably sipping sweet tea still, huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
That what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meal’s done
Yelawolf is gettin' back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still, son, woah
This old rock, the hill's been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas, when they handle this animalistic flow

[Hook: Ed Sheeran]
If you don’t know
If you don’t know by now, you better tell him ’bout it
What you gonna tell him ’bout? Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 6: Yelawolf]
I’m not the average half-a-wit after this hour gets out of this
60 seconds, I’m goin' any direction and
Chasing this Jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
Is probably the better idea, yeah, you move when the direction in
Fact, it's a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blow on this fucking mic like a wind 'til college start again
Hooligans, hooligans rule again but really who’s a friend?
Jump in this lake of fire, jump right back in the pool again
Knew I'd be new again, a student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I’m tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war, you don’t want it
Shady Records, I’m already better, fuck it, doggonnit
Dog don’t gotta lead, dog’s already home, Jack
Dogg I’m a beast, I’m a wolf, bring your dogs back (Woof !)
A melody-man and a melancholy mellow-yellow can
Shhhh, tell 'em how we gonna sell 'em man

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran & Yelawolf]
Been working hard all week
So if you wonder if we earned it, well it's not a probably
So won’t you bring that back to me
And holler when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween
I got blisters on my feet
To walk at night with you, is not the shoes to be borrowing
So won’t you bring that back to me
'Cause all the soul of my pen is only what all the sorrow brings
If you don’t know

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
You don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know (no, no, no, no)
If you don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know (no, no, no)
If you don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know (no, no, no, no)
If you don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know (no, no)
