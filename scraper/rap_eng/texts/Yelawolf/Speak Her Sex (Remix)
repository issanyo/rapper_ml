[Intro]
Aaaahhhhhh...
That's my spot
Ooohhh...

[Hook]
[Nikkiya]
Every night my little box be speakers sexing me
[Yelawolf]
Just hop in the box let the drop move you around
[Nikkiya]
Hoppin' out them juices flow like rivers on my sheets
[Yelawolf]
So much knock in it liftin' you straight off the ground
[Nikkiya]
Everything I really love be coming through them speaks
[Yelawolf]
Vibrate get you so wet girl long as my speakers on
[Nikkiya]
Long as my speakers on, I'm cummin' strong, it's like speaker sex to me

[Verse 1: Nikkiya]
I wanna ride with you
Did you let me get in there and rock with you?
Sip Hennessy in the back of the seat
And listen to the [?] drum go boom boom
That's right, bright like a headlight, high beam
I should get a ticket the way I lean
Bumpin' these speakhers I got from [?]
Oops I mean mary Jane, Oops I mean mary me
I took a shot of love and then I threw the dice on the board
Like it was a Lakers game
Mylo, You got a boombox and box of tissues clean
And a wish list for my business
In the back of your whip goes my lips [?], mane

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Nikkiya]
Baby won't you come round
I know you don't know nothing about me
But I got a cute face and the booty's round
You gon' love the sound, to hear me get down
I am new to town, got a tank a gas, let's cruise around
(I want you) did I say that? Nevermind just lay back
Not in the way back of a Maybach
But the place that's made where my kings lay at
So I ride around with a driver, The Chevy it's the best
Got rid of that Oldsmobile, Oldsmobile's Cutlass

[Hook]
