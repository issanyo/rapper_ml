[Intro]

Yo, Ay man, you know I ain’t perfect… Nobody is. No I stand to be corrected
I know one thing for certain though, these super men, these supermen don’t exist bro
God exists

[Verse 1]

This ain’t no ordinary story, with the hardships and glory
Let me take you deeper into the mind of a child of a bitch with addictions and a wish-list
Dear Father, can I get a man and a big ol’ house?
Lots of money and did I mention lots of money?
Funny how the world turns on me
Me and Mama was all alone
Wanted for the life that we once called home
Trying to get a grip on life gone wrong
Young Yelawolf, to tell the truth I came out just fine
Guess that’s why half of the people around me growing up said I lost my mind
But I just lost the time with friends instead the victim of crime
Touched by the demon’s lust and lost my innocence before 5
Molested, forgive my confessions, I’m an open book
Growing up to hate pentagrams on my seat in class no open book
I dreamed of a gangsta life
Any excuse to let go of this hurt
My folks were atheists, so I couldn’t let go in the church
Anybody who wanted it from me I would back down I was scared
I didn’t know how to win
Back then all I could do was dream about being Superman

[Hook]

Oh, Oh you’re looking at the sky watching Superman fly
Around the whole world while it’s falling apart
Oh, Oh we’re looking at the sky watching Superman fly
Around the whole world, while it’s falling apart

[Verse 2]

Superman I wish I was you
I wish I could kill anything that moves
Superman I wish I could, do anything that you could do
‘Cause you ain’t go no flaws and you don’t shed no tears
You ain’t never scared and you ain’t got no fears
Let the world drowned in my heart’s blood
Let ‘em see me in pain
Let ‘em see me at my worst let ‘em see me be happy again
Let ‘em see my cry let ‘em see me click
And run into the white house with a terminator gun and unload the clip on my government
I never be above my people
I just want more bread
Only to split it, divide it, give it provide it to who deserves it who is searching
For something that makes sense
If you’re happy with this shit, then pump it in the clubs
Then be content but Superman don’t ride on dubs he flies, shit

[Hook]

Oh, Oh you’re looking at the sky watching Superman fly
Around the whole world while it’s falling apart
Oh, Oh we’re looking at the sky watching Superman fly
Around the whole world, while it’s falling apart

[Verse 3]

Put on my cape I’m going for it
Fuck it, head on to a freight train
If they can do it in a video then a white boy from Alabama can do the same
(Geronimo!)
You got me fucked up I’m a trend setter
Rock Wal-mart shoes at the Grammys then drop on the roof on a skateboard dude
Whatever, whenever however the hell I want to say it I’ll say it
If I gotta say what I don’t mean sometimes the better
You could just replay it
Just so I could explain it
Just so I could be more human
Just so the devil could see me conquer it and get through it
This is all I got folk a little change and a dream
Not much in the eyes of the now but a billionaire in the scheme of things
A mascot for the ones broken down, now flying high
It’s a bird, it’s a plane, nah it’s Yelawolf riding by in a box (ha)

[Hook]

Oh, Oh you’re looking at the sky watching Superman fly
Around the whole world while it’s falling apart
Oh, Oh we’re looking at the sky watching Superman fly
Around the whole world, while it’s falling apart

[Outro]

Dedicated to the kids
Don’t look up for Superman ‘cause he don’t exist
Just trust God
All the kids in the war zones I am praying for you
Wolf is praying for you
Alabama’s praying for you
