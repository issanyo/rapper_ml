[Intro: Chainsaw Perry and Jim Morrison]
Swan again!
I need some mood music!
Find something good to listen to
Try to set the night on fire
That was Jim Morrison, and The Doors with "Light My Fire"
Hey, any man who dances with naked Indians in the deserts gotta make wicked rock
You tuned into the only station that thrashes, Alabama: The Stereo, classic rock, Y-W-O-L-F
I'm Chainsaw Perry *rrrr*
Next up, we got Pink Floyd's classic, "Brick In The Wall"
W-O-L-F

[Skit: Yelawolf, Chainsaw Perry, DJ Ideal, and Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
(We don't need no education) *door shaking* What the-
The window Yela!
Get him Ideal!
What the hell?
Tape him off
Come here buddy, let me talk to ya
Alrighty, grab the racket (Ay, ay, what's goin' on in)
Sorry Chainsaw *muffled screams*
You got him?
Chainsaw's down (We don't need no thought contr-) *music stops*
Your Stereo rock station has officially been taken over
By myself, Yelawolf, and my partners in crime, DJ Ideal and our time (What you say)
Let me talk to my people of Alabama for a second
See, since my shit can't be played on the rock station since it's too hip-hop (Shut up, Shut up)
And it won't play on the hip-hop station since it's too rock
We decided to take matters into our own hands *punch*
That's gonna leave a mark
So DJ Ideal (Yessir), our time (Yup)
You ready?
Let's get 'er done
Sorry Chainsaw
