[Pre-Chorus: Yelawolf]
There's something about this town
That brings me down
There's something about this place
It's written all over my face
I can't breathe anymore
I can't stand it
I can't see anymore
Man, goddammit
I'll go crazy if I don't get out!

[Chorus: Bob Seger (Sampled)]
Someday
I know I'll find that road
And I
Will pay back all I've owed
Somehow
I'll bear that heavy load
Someday

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Two pitbulls up in my yard
Barking, they ravenous
Broken bottles and trash in the grass of a Gadsden trailer park
I’m a fucking savage
I just woke up drunk and brushed my teeth with a soap bar
Blocks under that pickup truck
Drive by me with a mean mug, I’m jumping off the porch what’s up?!
Nothing to lose except my life
And I don’t give a fuck about that, so you do the math, how many fucks you got tonight?
Motherfuckers ain’t tough, I be the only white boy in this bitch gettin' buck
Face all bloody and cut up, yeah, I got you bruh
If it’s done it’s done, if it ain’t it ain’t
But I can’t quit, I can’t, I can’t

[Chorus: Bob Seger (Sampled)]
Someday
I know I'll find that road
And I
Will pay back all I've owed
Somehow
I'll bear that heavy load
Someday

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Robbing and stealing and dealing and working a temp
This dope is not paying, these wages ain’t making a dent
My baby’s mama just hung my clothes up on the fence
Cops on the corner, they stare and harass me for shit
Fuck what you riding, I’m riding, I jump in the donk
I get the feeling that we got some guns in the trunk
But I do not care who’s still pissed, I do not have a pot
So open the register, give me the money you got

[Pre-Chorus: Yelawolf]
There's something about this town
That brings me down
There's something about this place
It's written all over my face
I can't breathe anymore
I can't stand it
I can't see anymore
Man, goddammit
I'll go crazy if I don't get out!

[Chorus: Bob Seger (Sampled)]
Someday
I know I'll find that road
And I
Will pay back all I've owed
Somehow
I'll bear that heavy load
Someday
