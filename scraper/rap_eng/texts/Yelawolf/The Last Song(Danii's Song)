[Verse 1: Hiatus]
She never bothered asking me, where I'm from
Didn't want to know what I've been through, or what I've become
But if she knew what I'd seen and been through then she'd probably run off
Cuz she's scared of the truth so it's dead in secret lined in chalk
See I've been lost, didn't know that it would cost
One half of my mind, so much damn time, one half of my heart and soul
But you'll listen to me now I hope, instead of looking at me like a joke
Or leaving me behind, leaving me to cry, the way that you did before
And I'm learning quick, that you're probably never gonna come around
And I'm starting not to care, that to the peace that you helped me found
Now that you know, all I ever wanted to do was to make you proud
But when you grew up like you, you're more comfortable with a hard let down
And just so you know how good I'm doing here without you
I'mma upload the album cover just to show you myself
So if you find yourself in the middle of the floor with a bottle drinking yourself lonely
Then you can keep company with a picture of you and me on facebook, turn the page

[Hook Hiatus&Yelawolf]
Danii can you see me, I'm putting on a show
In the magazines, hear me on the radio
So do you think?
Well I hope that you're proud now
To watch it all go down
I'm sorry Danii you didn't get to watch me grow
Now I'm always on the road
No time to say hello, bye
Well I hope that you're proud now
To watch it all go down

[Verse 2: Hiatus]
Danii, if you hear this I know what you're probably thinking
You'll think that I'm rubbing it in, that I'm angrily dissing
Just take a second, listen to what I'm talking about
No vengeance in my voice, and Shaun's right here, he can vouch
I just wanted you to know how much of my life you were a part of
And how much of me left when we grew apart love
You need to understand, there's no anger here
If you're worried bout the get back, then have no fear
I don't hold a grudge, and I still hold you up
And guard you from anything you feel defenseless from
But everything we did I had to see, feel the pain, had to grieve
To become who I am, and I'm proud of the man I came to be
Cause what I've learned cannot be taught, and what I've earned cannot be bought
Justified, deserve it all, so don't be concerned, it's not your fault
I never counted sheep, I counted blessings
So if I see you now, no cold shoulder, Danii, this is my message
I'll tell ya

[Hook]
