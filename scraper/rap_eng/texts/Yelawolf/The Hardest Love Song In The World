[Intro]
I usually don't do this, but fuck it
You know what? (you know what?)

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
You're like the hardest thing I've ever seen
And I'm from the gutter so believe me, I've seen some hard things
You come from where the black flower grows
I wanted to cut you down and take you home, call me Axl Rose
I could see you in a 1976 Camaro
Me and you, sipping whisky, gettin' drunker than Jack Sparrow
Is Black Sabbath, how you get mellow huh
Well put your feet on my Harley Davidson pedals
And rock and roll girl

[Hook: Poo Bear]
Like a diamond cuts through a pearl
This is the hardest love song in the world
You can get it in with your girl
To the hardest love song in the world, ah yeah
You're Hardest love song in the world

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
You don't got to drive a Fleetwood Cadillac
You just got to know some words to Fleetwood Mac
Horror movies turn you on, pull the sheets back
Fuck it, I roleplay, do it to you in a Jason mask
You switch walkers like a switch blade
You walk into the room and it's like these other bitches get hit with a grenade
With that said
Let me pull the spandex pants off you with my teeth like Ozzy did a bat head
I rock and roll, let's go

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
You ain't concerned with new clothes or salaries
You would rather run across the country like Mickey and Mallory
Be the natural born killer that you are
We'll hang out the window with a pistol and I drive the car
We'll rob the Dollar General for nothin' but snack food
Shoot anything that moves, dogs and cats too
Renact the hardest movie scenes, bloody shirts and holy jeans
We the hardest you and me, rock and roll baby

[Hook]

[Outro]
Click bang, like magic
I could do better
Yeah, hardest love song in the world
