(Verse 1: Yelawolf)
I don't need no introduction but let me introduce myself
A buck seventy-five of one of the livest beat riders from the bible belt
A.L.A.B.A.M.A went to LA and hit TV
Packed my shit then wrote some hits and hit the streets of NYC
NYC was home til' I rolled down to the creekwater of ATL
Picked a bail of hay from the roots of it all then I put it in a ball to see what sells
Hit for the 5 get it for the 5 can I get a 5 for this well fuck gimme 3
I'll take what I get then give what I take then take what I gave ya I'm an Indian chief
Ha ha ha ha thats survival that one of my personal rivals
Don't worry bout' my rates, if you folks then I'll circumcise ya
I'll give ya a purple higher, if you want that fire
Well, take a hit of that thick white smoke burnin' off my Goodyear tire

(Hook)
I'm a small town boy doing doughnuts in the grocery parkin' lot
I'mma make some noise doing doughnuts in your momma's parkin' lot
I'm a small town boy doing doughnuts on the police parkin' lot
I'mma make some noise doing doughnuts on the labels parkin' lot

(Verse 2: Yelawolf)
Mark a spot, circle circle figure 8 I come and drop
Like a christian man caught with a mistress and I run and hide
Came to the earth with a searchlight and a dirtbike
I'm good in the woods at night
Hey i'll bet a hoes ice on a bird fight
I'm good in the hood with a price
I never worry bout' should I coulds well if so maybes when it comes to rappin'
If it can be done on the mic i'mma do it and leave the people clappin'
Thank you very much what a rare touch yelawolf puts to the track when he lets go
Well if you got young nese connect on the beat and you do it buddy you could never blow
So go ahead and talk that shit I'mma go ahead and walk that pizz
If you wanna through salt at this you the one that help me get rich
I ain't never had an engine quit I grab the wheel with a real tight grip
And when I throw down my stick shift I got the show up my hands 'n all the fans holla...

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Yelawolf)
Hoh!, look at him goooo that boys got life in him
I ain't never seen anybody do a burnout on a flippin' bycicle
I'm a peddelar make an editor get ahead on words
Not an amateur I can dance on verbs like an outlandish nerd
Spend all of my time working on chokin' everybody up in the crowd
Makin em' run for the mass cause they can never breathe inside my cloud
Boom lightning strike, my black lines are nice and bright
Some live 9 and rifle hype so I keep my hatchet in sight
Hey this ain't rap, this active wack shit laxitive
Let that shit go you could never run with the wheels rotating rapidly
Riiing rev it up, emergency break on lock
Hammer it on, cock to the side, burn my rubber until it pops!

(Hook)
