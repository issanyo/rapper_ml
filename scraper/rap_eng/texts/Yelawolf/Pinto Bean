Intro:
Yeah
Yeah
Fucking gettin it
Yeah
Yelawolf bitch
Ok ok ok

Verse:
I told that bitch to meet me at the condo
Just tell me where I can locate that fuck around though
She said I know he’s somewhere dope
And gettin gassed up
So he stuck his ass up at the [?]

Ho boy
Playboy
I’m too raw to have my own business
Ain’t I just gettin it
Though my story should be prohibited

Bitches is gigglin
Dudes are like infinitely hating
But this is a pivotal shift in the career of Michael Atha
Yeah

Michael Atha on a bike
I’m psycho
Harley Davidson
Shifty pop em if it’s droppin
Then I microwave em
Yeah

Sip sippin
Trippin
Grab the mic and shock the stage and yeah
Leave em rocking like the Cook Up
Whippin pots of bacon yeah

So don’t hold the door before the show
We over so we toe to toe with the promoter
So and so is throwing shoulder
So go get your Motorola
Get that one dash three and four
And call up for patrol for local air
Before we hit the road
I’m out

I am out
I am higher than a spout of a chevron
Oil liquid gasoline is in a drought
Out in that Chevrolet still
Yeah I’m in that Chevrolet still
He want ten racks for that dip
Boy I bet I pay for them wheels

I’m nervous bout that rent
Boy I bet I wait for that deal
I’m nervous bout that bitch
Boy I bet I pay for them heels

Church
Aw hell
Yelawolf went so far left
That he came full circle
No bullets and no revolver left

Been at the cross with the tall nails
But I make peace with my fate boss
Third eye open so set sail
Man it was nothing like what they thought

From Alabama so how did I get so open minded
When I got hillbillies posted up
Dippin Skoal behind me
Go poke around the soil
My roots are covered in blood
How can I not be deep
Unfold the origami

I went from salami and ramen noodles
To wasabi and..
What is it?
I can’t pronounce those
Who?
So you can take the boy up out the swimming hole
But you can’t take Catfish Billy up out the flows now

You ain’t gotta walk around
Looking like somebody took your best chicken
From the coop
Or took your coupe and crashed it into the booth
[?]
I am a leader but neither will I [?]
If you say I’m a leader then follow me
Don’t bother me with fucking ideas

Seen
Quote it
Print it
Ching

After every single dream
Ash to wind
Is to me
Pinto beans
Chingo bling
And blue suede
Is to king
Like a blade
Is to sling

And I reckon I’m gon’ Kill em
