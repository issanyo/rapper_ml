Can't even tell ya how hot it's been
All I know is that I make eskimo's sweat, when I grab a pen
When it's below ten, degrees
Act like I haven't blessed you, pretend, sneeze
Walk on the beat bent knees
Landlord still buggin' "Can I get the rent please?"
I told her I got the money, in my Jiz-eans
Don't worry, I spit sixteens like zipped seams
(Quook, Pow) I fossilize emcee's
T-Rex knock I leave water in cups rippling
Said you on vacation just to ask you (Are you tripping!?)
Only became your teacher just to pass you (Rik Riiiing, Riiiing)
Tell your bitch she should keep her eyes closed
I'm a fire-man, I put the water inside these hose
Put her face in the cannon, like Alamo
Take a picture of her drinkin' whisky, in designer clothes
I told her I would take her out for sushi rolls
But I fed her dog food, straight Alpo
WHAT?! Did I lie to her too much, confide in her too much
Said I was ridin' with the bucks, My pride was hidin' my love
But I believe I'm alive I'm alive ya ain't live enough
To fuck with this poor pimp and these hoes I'm allowed to fuck
Could it be the way that I fuck with a big dick (Haha)
Switch the position let me bring it like Slick Rick (Watch)
Get on all fours baby, you know how we do it shawty
No I don't have a Mercedes but I know how you like Bacardi
Hop up in the bucket seat, let me make room for ya
Wal-Mart white panties, let me move 'em for ya
Alabama I'mma bring the fuckin' truth home
So tell me hater what would you like up on your tombstone
You were lookin' for a fight to pick with me
So tell me what the views like sittin' six feet deep
