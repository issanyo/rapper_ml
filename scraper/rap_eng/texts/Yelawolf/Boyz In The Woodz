[Hook]
Cause the boys in the woods are always hard
Some of them white-trash some of them ride hogs
Knowing nothing in life but trucks and sticks
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 1]
Now, I like my butter and greens, I like my plate full of soul
I'm the one who got that sloppy hooker holding my doe
I'm the king of the strip if strip means I get down
I'll pull trick and make em' put a dick in the fucking ground
I'm as smooth as it gets
I'mma move into this, Double-wide with a porch and pay 200 of rent
When you run into this might as well run into bricks
I been learning how'da stack you, put a track on deck
Put a dollar on the table and stand up on your bitch
Holler if your able and let me see how dirty you get
If your feeling like a fighter put a plug in your clip
Cause if you empty ammo at me you got more to deal with
More relatives then a cat with kitty litter and piles
With motherfuckers born to give a cop quotas and files
Should I show you the style or should I show you door
Well, I could show you how'da hide a pound of weed in the floor cause...

[Hook]
Cause the boys in the woods are always hard
Some of them white-trash some of them ride hogs
Knowing nothing in life but trucks and sticks
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit

[Verse 2]
Wait up hold up a second who said the south can not kick it
Well I guess spittin' ain't shit when give ignorant tickets
Open up on your rhythm lables got to try harder
If you give the truth a chance you will go two times farther
Most guys don't bother so I fuck with KP drop a verse about me
Cause me is gettin' the cheese me is breezing in peace
Cause me a preaching MC
Too many sick in the beach, scratchin' and reachin' for he
Back so why do yelawolf is gotta buzz in the street
I ate a tuna sam-mitch made of bumble bee
Posted up on a corner with a rumblin' teeth
Are you and K, Catfish Billy are you they
Yeah I'am in the creekwater jumpin' on snake head
Never had hydraulics so I'm pumpin' them breaks yeah
Ain't ch'ya ever pull hunny frontin' them cars
This is why, this is why, this is why I am hard

[Hook]
Cause the boys in the woods are always hard
Some of them white-trash some of them ride hogs
Knowing nothing in life but trucks and sticks
Don't quote me boy cause I ain't said shit
