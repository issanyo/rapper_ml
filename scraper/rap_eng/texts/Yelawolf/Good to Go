[Hook]
Good to go, good to go
Good to go, good to go
Fresh kicks (all day)
New fits (alright)
Drop hits (all day)
Then party (all night)
Good to go, good to go
Good to go, good to go
Fresh kicks (all day)
New fits (alright)
Drop hits (all day)
Then party (all night)

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Walk with a limp and I talk with a lingo
Party with a bunch of bad girls in a Pinto
Run up on a motherfucker with a dull pencil
Sharpen up my number two on his new Benzo
Hit the breaks, hold up, wait, make you do an endo
Put the bass in your face, you can feel the tempo
Yela's in the place, grab a stencil
You should wanna get a copy of the style
I'll lend your ass, the man so bad
From Alabama with a banjo, clap clap
Sling blades like a Rambo, fix that
I don't want to hear shit buddy, that's that
Can't get a buzz, well run back to the bar
Pick another drink, get ready to blow
Send me your telephone number bitch
Maybe when I'm ready to roll I'll hit you with a totem pole
But right now I'm

[Hook]
Good to go, good to go
Good to go, good to go
Fresh kicks (all day)
New fits (alright)
Drop hits (all day)
Then party (all night)
Good to go, good to go
Good to go, good to go
Fresh kicks (all day)
New fits (alright)
Drop hits (all day)
Then party (all night)

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Well boy you wanna do shit, let's get to it
You already know I'mma run right through it
I'm just like fluid, matter fact like water
Come and be real or go lil harder
Hide your girlfriend, wife, or daughter
Put her on a plate I'mma serve your order
Line em up, put em in place for the slaughter
Game over by the end of first quarter
Wake up hater, rise and shine
I'm a star boy, you riding pine
I got your main girl riding mine
Her face in my lap as I recline
It's grinding time and I declare
I run my fingers through her hair
I run these streets like marathons
You can't touch me like Hammer, gone

[Hook]
I'm good to go, good to go
Good to go, good to go
Fresh kicks (all day)
New fits (alright)
Drop hits (all day)
Then party (all night)
Good to go, good to go
Good to go, good to go
Fresh kicks (all day)
New fits (alright)
Drop hits (all day)
Then party (all night)

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Bitch, you know I got Bun B in the front seat
And we got these boppers on the chrome
One time for your boy Pimp C, pocket full of stones
Yeah, I gotta pocket full of stones
'Cause I fell off my dirt bike in cargo pants
I rock the microphone literally
Litter the track lyrically with bottles cans
Pop a band, put a stack on it I'll water these plants like Aqua Man
Make a rapper run back to the studio
Retrace his steps like he dropped a gram
I'll be damned, Catfish Billy
You don't wanna run if your rhythm ain't ready
Sling syllables, beat's edible, incredible, inevitably BLOW!

[Hook]
Good to go, good to go
Good to go, good to go
Fresh kicks (all day)
New fits (alright)
Drop hits (all day)
Then party (all night)
Good to go, good to go
Good to go, good to go
Fresh kicks (all day)
New fits (alright)
Drop hits (all day)
Then party (all night)
