[Intro]

Diamonds are forever…
So I’ve heard
Yeah yeah yeah big, big, big swollen old things
Yelawolf
I’ma give a shoutout to Kanye West for this beat right here


[Chorus]

(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever…)
I guess that’s why Roc-A-Fella is still rocking
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever…)
I guess that’s why, that I got coal in my stocking
(Forever…)
Coal turns to stone, and stone turn to rings
And rings become fashion
(Forever…)
Hey, if it lasts forever
I want to know myself
And I’m tired of asking

[Verse 1]

Take a deep breath
In 3 minutes there be no air left
I drop verses like she used to drop purses
When I used to pop glass with a spark plug lurking’
Thuggin's a label that I could claim for certain
To smart for jail time, I moved under the surface
Low budget crooks do wicked thangs
I spit one Christmas Eve, one year lifting names offa’ boxes
Sitting on the gift like a hostage
A old Grinch that stole Christmas from a nice kid
But Billy didn’t really need it, did he?
I mean I knew the reality of veracious pity
But really my homeboy was calling and my wallet was missing
My angel was too far away I guess I hurt his feelings
I’m looking up, and my nose is on the ceiling
The walls are closing in on my dreams and the vision
Oversee with me and a family seems far away
And impossible to come to a stage of obedience
I’m seeing grief in the seat of another man fathering my child of my destiny
And I need control
Yeah
Man at least I know better
But all I’m thinking is a diamond looks better
Time faded thewounds I’ve paved for the grave that I dug for the victim of my lost soul-ways

[Verse 2]

Days passed on me like a blimp
I could only pray that the heartache that I gave was okay
Mumma didn’t raise no fool
(Nah)
But mumma had a use for the jewels, they gave her a attitude
Young people dying at the hands of the beast in the East
Digging diamonds for the old white man
The power of the jewel is the prism it creates
When the light in the cut makes the colors expand
(Yeah)
Fools misuse and mislead and deny
That the real reason they would kill for the blue thrill
Is only because the status of the rock makes the hand of the owner feel like a real meal
When women can’t get a real meal
When men can’t get a hot meal
When kids can’t get a cooked meal
How does that make you feel?
Here an American on the hill
You could be in the projects still
You could never feel the hurt, the chill
You’re ice ain’t cold enough, kneel
Kneel before the lies that gave
Kneel before the pain that it’s sourced so you can feel like you mean something
You really mean nothing
You’re grill means nothing
(Yeah I said it)
Children are suffering but they cheering you in public
(What?)
Jesus on the chain don’t make the Imperial love it

[Verse 3]

Halt!
Serial numbers decoded by the diamond thief in the vault
Ten carat piece
Ten souls bought
20 lives lost in the journey from the 17th century till now
Family heirloom that kept daddy proud
Taken like a grain of sand from a desert mound
They will never miss it
The crew will get rich with the stone
Just to see his baby come home

Taken by the diamond slave miners as a child
The rewards only really to see his daughter smile
So I guess the gift that I took makes sense
He stole it for his baby
I stole to give a gift
Wow

Yeah just think man
Just think
Going to run through it before you spend the cash on it
Hold up
Hold one up
Yeah

[Chorus]
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever…)
I guess that’s why Roc-A-Fella is still rocking
(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever…)
I guess that’s why, that I got coal in my stocking
(Forever…)
Coal turns to stone, and stone turn to rings
And rings become fashion
(Forever…)
Hey, if it lasts forever
I want to know myself
And I’m tired of asking

(Diamonds are forever, forever, forever…)

Yeah

[Outro]

Kid rock
It’s ghetto
Yeah
Rock on…
Alabama
Rock on…
Shiny diamond
Number 7
Prism
Number 3
Prism with the light of god
Number 7 the most hot
And number 9, number 9
