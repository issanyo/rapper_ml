[Verse]
HA HA HA
These haters are trippin'
They want me to get Buck Wrapped
But before i do something that stupid
I Fall in love with cat stacks
And stop reppin' Alabama and move to Japan like
"Ni-Hao, Ki-Shen"
"Hello, how are you? how you been?"
But I'm doin' fine!
Everything, everything, everything's Golden
These hoes are mine!
How do I pimp when I never change clothing?
Cause I grab her by the hip?
Should I take her lip?
Like I'm fucking back again
And when I take her to the whip
She gon' get it wet
But when I put it on the left
Everybody lookin' at the menu now
And wanna get a verse from the wolf
Well bitch, do I look like a cook? (no)
So why you askin' me what's good?
He worked in the 80's
A little little country baby
The baby had a dream
But baby had a thing for lighting up leather in 80's
(That boy's crazy) Everybody called him crazy
He didn't understand
'Til he put fire to the end of the Wick
And the shit blew up in his hand, damn!
Call 911, I blew off an appendige
Went to jail on acid for a whiskey bottle sentence
AH!
