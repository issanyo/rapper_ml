[Hook-Priceless]
Can I have your attention please?
I don't mean to disturb ya
But if you listen to this
That makes you a witness to murda
Cuz' you just heard me kill it
Each word he spittin' so absurdly different
Girlfriend like no he didn't
My only option is to kill it

[Verse 1-Priceless]
I'm
What you can't what you won't say
I'm
O.J. on a slow day
I just Nicole the beat with hot flows for weeks
Better call animal control on me, control on me
Cuz the beast is out
I'm a creature, I'm a gargoyle
Never crack under water like a hard-boiled
These other niggas scramble for the handouts
Comcast channel 1 I'm in demand now
You gotta stand up to stand out
You either born with steez or you born to hate
I'm Norman Bates of a performance stage
And after every performance they
Wanna fornicate
Should've listened to the warnings hey
Just be happy that she left with a star
Instead of looking salty
Haaaaaa
Prolly wish you would have left her in the car
I never take her out to Geisha House
Eating groceries from your bank account
I enter in then enter her
And exit out with a grateful bow
Take this as my thanks for now
For willingly being an accomplice honest
I know you know I killed it
Thats our secret don't reveal it
Priceless and Catfish Billy
What the peoples been asking for
Cuz they wanna hear us spazzz some more
Like wait wait how the fuck they do that
Earthquake quake coming out the 2-track
Move back
Scratch that get a little closer
Explosive detonations
On stages
I'm reigning
So amazing

[Verse 2- Yelawolf]
Catfish
And I'm swimming thru the madness
Thru pools of white girls
Tooting more lines than an atlas
You wanna be deep in the party?
Well buddy then get on the map
Alabama's in this bitch now
In Atlanta where the bottles don't cap
Pop it off
Slow it down
Throw it on tap
Rollin' with a crew and I'm finna lean back back
Sippin' on a beer and I'm in a chevrolet
Get up in a box and I'm finna pull away
Yeweee
Yewee
Yellar
Stepping out the cellar
Bumping Sargent Pepper
Leaving rappers severed
Doing doughnuts in your yard
I'm leaving crop circles
That ain't no UFO
That's someone who you know
I'm your neighbor with the music up til the early mornin'
I came to your trailer to borrow some sugar from your woman
Got a spoon full of it
To help medicine go down (yep)
And on the way back home
I threw that spoon on the ground (yep)
Ya I'm a one a kind
One of the 9 of the 10 who really got the gift
Yelawolf in the woods like a porcupine
So don't get stuck with the quills

[Verse 3-Priceless]
This here that cause and effect
That got you nodding your neck
Got your ipod in the deck
Let me just pause for a sec
[pause]
Had to adjust my steez
Not here by like you see
I'm spitting everywhere
It's like a fucking sneezed
Gimme a second to give you a lesson
I take that back and present you a question
Have you ever seen dope in it's fleshness?
You're looking at it in all of it's essence
I represent where the Marta is present [A-townnn]
Droughts hit like it's part of the desert
I'm only applying part of the pressure
Hold on next parts getting better
Cuz imagine when it's full force something like the riots
Call them Barry Bond's, they ain't fucking with the giants
Science
Couldn't describe what happens
Prescribe my rapping
It's dope dope
Inside this napkin
I hold hold
A butterknife
It'll draw blood if you cut her right
Sike
Hear the flow and shutter like
[damn]
It's bout to be a cold summer right
Ha
I  mean a real hot winter
You just entered
The twillight twillight
Upside down is my life my life
Cigarettes butts and high lifes high lifes
This track is what you
Tell em' that you wanna hear
Me and yellar' here to commandeer
Your brother and cousin and your mama's ear
And anyother volunteers
Like ewww
