[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah, I crawl through beats like I had paws for feet
That's why they call them tracks
I dial into my tone, that's why these bitch rappers never call me back
But I didn't hang up on you, I just hung you out to dry
Clothes line! Little babies, go to school, don't pout and cry
So sick that I make sick sick
Stick dick in a bitch with slit wrist
Just to get a quick fix, sip syrup - sip fix
Hurry get a twit pic, I'm on! (Yeah, I'm on)
And you gon' smell my cologne (I'm on)
Some Issey Miyake or some Bond No. 9 (yeah, I'm on)
Yeah

[Hook: Big HUD]
I'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho
Catch me posted on the block like I'm a valero
Put that dagger in your heart like a bow and arrow
Somebody had to lose, I guess that's how to game go (yeah!)
The game go, I guess that's how the game go
I'm Far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho (yeah!)
My main ho, I put that on my main ho
I'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho

[Verse 2: Rittz]
She know that I'm a pro and I don't even got to tell her
White bitch looking like Sarah Michelle Gellar
Got her tipsy on vanilla
Ghetto one she say she wanna get to know me better
I said it, I could read her mind, she like an open letter
Next thing you know I had her face against a feather pillow
In a cheap hotel yelling at her while I drill her
Like a jack hammer, almost flacked in her
Tap-tap-tapping that ass like a tap dancer
Then I skeeted, told that bitch to leave or I'mma' back-hand her
I'm just playing baby, I don't really act in that manner
Cause' my game so suave, I ain't scared of cakin' on a lady
Especially when she give a great blowjob
We can go to dinner, Stoney River steak, go park
Martini bar, swear it ain't no prob'
Now just keep your mouth shut 'bout us
Now hush, You don't wanna piss my main ho off

[Hook: Big HUD]
I'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho
Catch me posted on the block like I'm a valero
Put that dagger in your heart like a bow and arrow
Somebody had to lose, I guess that's how to game go (yeah!)
The game go, I guess that's how the game go
I'm Far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho (yeah!)
My main ho, I put that on my main ho
I'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho

[Verse 3: Young Stuggle]
I ain't a killer but don't push me
My moneyrun long like John Holmes in the pussy
Married to these streets, I got a cocaine wife
They say the folk ain't right
Leave my momma alone and blame my life
If Kenny Powers fucked Griselda Blanco I'd be they son
With a hundred grand
Still claiming kids that ain't mine to get that tax refund
Ten food stamp cards in my pocket, shit, none of 'em mine
Slumerican pie, subliminal crimnal crimes ahead of my time

[Hook: Big HUD]
I'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho
Catch me posted on the block like I'm a valero
Put that dagger in your heart like a bow and arrow
Somebody had to lose, I guess that's how to game go (yeah!)
The game go, I guess that's how the game go
I'm Far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho (yeah!)
My main ho, I put that on my main ho
I'm far from a bitch and I put that on my main ho
