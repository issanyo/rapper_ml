[Intro: Slim Thug]
Geyeah
Slim Thugga
Boss Hogg Outlawz, Jim Jonsin, ha
Representin this Texas mayne
Back

[Hook: Yelawolf]
I run, the streets all night and day (the hood love Thug)
Cause I still run, the streets all night and day
(If you tryin to find me)
(I rep for my city, go hard for the hood)
(Still posted on the block, what's good?)
And I run, the streets all night and day (ha)
I can't stay away

[Verse 1: Slim Thug]
They don't make too many niggas like me
Bonifide hustler, certified G
Still got that work if you got the right fee
You thankin shit fake? Well nigga come see
It's bigger than the jewels, it's bigger than the cars
It's bigger than the fact that we fuckin rap stars
The street niggas know me, these boys got my contacts
Knowin any given minute I can come back
I put a bitch on I-10 and tell her run dat
Give her ten and tell her don't brang nuttin back
I'm still in the hood, I can't leave the streets
It's in my blood, I'm a thug 'til I be deceased

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]
Ya'll know what it is
We runnin' the streets baby
That's ya'll runnin' round Hollywood
Tryin' to get in the bougie cups
Paris Hilton walk past me
And I didn't even know who she was
Perez Hilton walk past too
And I didn't even know him because
I don't be with that gossip talk
Got some dope but it ain't enough
I ain't takin' no John Maccain
Whatcha mean? won't take a loss?
My record label didn't do her thang
Before they had came I've been a boss
Grenchys chicken papadoes
Been skatin' on top of foos
Know I'm stayin' on top of toes try to take it
I'mma cock and load gotta, gotta know bossyness
Is my charcater self made grown man
Like what the heck is a parent for
I pledge alligence to the united banks of America
Ain't nothin' funny about the money
And ya'll lookin' histartical

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Z-Ro]
Ya'll already know Z-Ro be runnin' the streets all day
Back in Willowridge I wasn't in the classroom
'Ro was in the hallway
Now that I'm a grownup, blunts still get rolled up
But I got the bank of america sewed up
But I ainâ€™t talkin bout a hold-up
And no I don't have a diploma
But I'm still a home owner
Signed to Rap-A-Lot Records
But Z-Ro is his own owner
I've got paper today
But when I was broke I was on the corner
From mo city but I be in every hood
Except mo city Donanna
Put on the radio
And I hear Z-Ro done died again
Same fake ones that cried last time
They're cryin again
I'm a C dog and I get love and repect
From all my B dogs
Cause the colder the New York city to Las Angleles
Everyone know me dog

[Hook]
