SourMilk, JustIncredible
L.A. Leakers
Mustard on the beat ho!
Alabama rich, I'm Alabama rich
Shady Records, Ghet-O-Vision
Hello kids I'm in
This bitch with hits, Big Cameron
Fuck around I leave your Momma with a candle lit
Speaking of candles lit, happy birthday me
Radioactive is a magnet for birthday treats
New house, fresh shoes
It's like all my opponents saw me and said let's lose
Good move
Is it me or the fate, let's choose
Cause I'm teaching the class, you mothafuckas slept through
So even the haters only instigating my students
But a couple of questions that I won't say yes to
Like Mr. Bobalina Mr. Bob Domalina
Can I sic em for ya Bob can I pick the chrome nina up
And pick em off for ya from afar with the beamer
Cause I seen I'm he’s a fault he’s a real cob-cleaner
I should let em loose but I refuse to be an abominator
You hate on me and you're probably an Obama hater
Laugh at you chronic players, sick with a sonic laser
And shoot you from Pluto with a soup bowl full of Now & Laters
Weakened and still seeking a shot cause I’m a power-fader
Shower these cowards without a doubt of my power
And take ya bitch without a shower
Til I’m sour ten hours later
She’ll still come back lying about the wonderful mouth I gave her
Ugh, everybody knows I’m a loose cannon with a wick
Bout the size a fucking toothpick
But I might go quick and assume the damage
But I gave this beat it’s like a treat for a chief example
That I got a way with tracks like a Chinese weave scandal
Back away from the bicycle
Tricycles fit you better
Pick another cypher, better yet pick up a rifle
And do yourself a favor kill yourself midget ho
And do it next to a river so nobody gotta dig a hole
