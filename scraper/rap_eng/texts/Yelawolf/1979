[Intro]
It's my time
I Need it
I Need this all black
Black, black 1979 Chevrolet
Sitting on my driveway
Smoked out

[Verse 1]
Rolling in my brand new Chevy
Candy-black, paint is deli'
Butters all round, interior blazing
Wood grain flow with the navigation
Sun beam on the trunk
Bust through town with [?] gods
Buzz lights on, in and out
[?], rolling south
Out the window, driving fast
Build a temple of this map
Can I speed up till I hit the curb
Breaking this ride would be absurd..
This spacing shit
Pop the hut, palms on deck
Love to roll zigzag
King ship, space wad

[Hook]
Eyyy riding by (I'm riding by)
Cruising around (Cruising around)
Feeling fine in my 1979 (in my 1979)
Riding by (riding by)
Cruising around (Cruising around)
Feeling fine in my 1979

[Verse 2]
Slim walk, ride o' kicking
[?], bill pile spitting
Splash back harder than loud
Creekwater I'm paddling down
How does it sound? holler back
Earn my will, swallow that
Dirt road, loose rock
Pedal to the car, 50 high socks
See me when I stop, yell when I'm gone
But I can't hear you when I'm zoning
Done turned off my secular phone
Jerk, jerk leave me alone
Buddy I'm high, too elevated
Church on the cloud
Maybe sunday with my super clean machine
Even with mud on my high beams

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Windows sprayed, no tint
Cuz you can't see my face
135 down the highway
Under control early friday
Just got a wax, sparkle, sparkle
Thinder cuts are also artful
Won't get this, hmm why?
I don't think I really wanna sent you by
Relax, this ain't cheap
Minimum wage won't get you these
[?] and make you wanna pee, pee
P-I-M-P and not one ho
Until I venting, Yelawolf sentence
On a one nice of a nine piece of gold

[Hook]
