[Intro]

[Mother]
Michael Wayne
I love you my darling
My angel since birth
Mercy stay beside you

[Yelawolf]
Alright, I love you

[Mother]
I love you too. Bye

[Verse 1]
Lately I've been afraid of myself
The closer that I get to rain
The more I feel at home, the further I'm away
And all that I feel is pain

[Hook]
Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Cause these crimson tears falling
And my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins

[Verse 2]
The morningâ€™s a cross I bear when I wake
Am I asleep? Have I broken my faith?
Down on my knees, can you hear me when I pray?
Or am I a little too late to...

[Hook]
Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Cause these crimson tears falling
And my shirt is blood-stained
Cause the devil's forever in my veins
And the devil's forever in my veins

[Hook]
Count me, count me, call my name
Don't leave me out in shame
Cause these crimson tears falling
And my shirt is blood-stained
And the devil's forever in my veins
The devil's forever in my veins
The devil's forever in my veins
