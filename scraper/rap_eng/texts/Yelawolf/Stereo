[Intro]
Stereo!
You're amazing
So amazing
Stereo
Stereo!

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
White girls and beer (not just white girls)
What's going on?
Women everywhere get loose
Laced up like a thigh high tennis shoe
I’m the host with the beer (yeah)
What’s going on?
Bring another bottle for the crew
While we get gone and lost in
Sound waves!
I’m the one in the speaker you listen to
Quick to sigh and dis in my interview
But I only react when I listen to
Stereo, stereo, stereo
Emotionally invoking me to, why?
Fall in love with the color yellow
I’m all about
Stereo!

[Chorus]
You're amazing, so amazing
You're contagious, when you play it
Stereo gets them out of their clothes, why?
Because she's so fucking bad
When she move that ass to my stereo

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Girls with beer, what's going on?
Standin' with your clique looking at me
I know you wanna talk to me
Bartender I'm here, what's going on?
One down, two down, three down, four down, with sound
Sound waves!
I’m the one in the speaker you listen to
Quick to sigh and dis in my interview
But I only react when I listen to
Stereo, stereo, stereo
Emotionally invoking me to, why?
Fall in love with the color yellow
I’m all about
Stereo!

[Chorus]
You're amazing, so amazing
You're contagious, when you play it
Stereo gets them out of their clothes, why?
Because she's so fucking bad
When she move that ass to my stereo

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Sexy girl, sidewalk queen
Too much lip gloss, too much Jim Beam
You like rockin', you like rollin'
Pills in bottles, backside swollen
Got no money, but you got beauty
You get sleezy, always moody
Tongue kissing your girlfriend, on the floor, do it again
Taxi cabs, late nights, all the time high as a kite
Broke and boosie, wanna get rich?
You love music? You love hits
You want love? Love's expensive
But it’s free, when the DJ’s spinning
Always green light, always go
Push play
Stereo!

[Chorus]
You're amazing, so amazing
You're contagious, when you play it
Stereo gets them out of their clothes, why?
Because she's so fucking bad
When she move that ass to my stereo
