[Yelawolf]

[Intro]
'Ello mate!
(oi oi oi oi oi oi}
The names Yela'rr

People jumping, people yelling, people acting wild
Jack D is here in my system can't you see my style?
Look a don't wanna show no drama, a don't wanna get stupid
But if you bitch rappers run-off al show you where the school is
Take a picture, take a bill but you can't take my pride
Ain't no mistaken Yela makin hip-hop come alive
So here we go or should a say bo!
Gun powder in the barrel, light the wick at my show
Cause a T-N-T !!!!

[Hook]
Oi, oi, oi, oi, oi, oi x3
TNT!
Watch me explode!

Well a put on my shades, sometimes a wear 'em at night
Cause when am up on the stage, the light is too bright
It don't hurt my eyes it just hurts the haters
To see this Alabama Cracker on point like a laser
A got Weed a got Coke
Well not really (Coke)?
But my DJ got the wells so you know where to go
So your getting bumps and your sipping the tea
No you ain't hallucinating am who it be
Cause am T-N-T!!!

(oi oi oi oi oi oi)x3

Watch me explode!!!!

Mr.Police man is no friend of mine
Some call him a hero, but a just call him the swine
He bought his Casio, and a stole mine
He said you can't afford the watch but you can do the time
Cold-blooded and cruel but thats just how it goes
Make your money, pay the county, and hit the road
Hey, don't ask me cause a just don't know
Gimme your microphone and al make it explode
Cause a B-A-D
Am ready to lose it
All my folks are gettin drunk
Crazy girls are pukin
A know the flyer said B-Y-O-B
But am still in the cooler
Cause am T-N-T
