[Bridge]
Some people run from some people who wanna save 'em
Some people got guns, some people you wanna stay from
When the train rode in, why did all my friends turn around and say "goodbye"?
'Cause some people don't know they standing at the station...

[Verse 1]
Come on in, I'm making room for you, her, and him
Also for those, we, them, and they, three course meal on a silver tray
Lay in the lab of luxury, watch fine wine incubate
With the white cloth laid over the side, one for the hands, one for the face
One for the luck, one for the pride, one way ride out of yesterday
You can lay down or you can lie, just don't lie straight to my face
Got a place you can keep the coats at, and a safe for the jewelry
Got a place to develop the Kodak to keep up with the memories
And the picture frame from the past, you can hang it up on the wall
And you can watch your past from the back of the train as you leave it all
You might seen a few trains come by, but this train you never saw before
You better make up your mind the conductor is saying “all aboard!"

[Bridge]

[Hook]
All, all aboard
Opportunity's in place and it might never come back this way
You better go and get in that train
All, all aboard
Opportunity's in place and it might never come back this way
You better go and get in that train

[Verse 2]
It's such a view, but it's reserved for such the few
Such the luck for such as who, but who is me and who is you
You got a free ride that you can't refuse, choice in the form of a new caboose
A chance in the shape of a railroad track, hop inside make the move
Break from the old and create the new
Leave all the fake and replace the true
Pack the bags, leave the name tag, claim the ticket God paid for you
Drapes of linen, navy blue, but they're not made to block the light
The light from the sun will see us through
And you can sleep well in the peace of night
'Cause you might not see it twice in the small town where you live
So believe in the right to life 'cause the the left to death is where you steer
You might seen a few trains come by but this train you never saw before
You better make up your mind the conductor is saying “all aboard!"
