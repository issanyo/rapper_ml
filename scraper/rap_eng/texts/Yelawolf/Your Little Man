[Verse 1 : Struggle]
Pain cut deep like Ginsu
See the tears that you grin through
Can't blame yourself for what I've been through
I was too wild for you to tend to
4 foot tall, felt 10'2"
Look who the hell we kin to
I was raised by a saint
Even in the Bible it says the disciples sin too
Ain't condone what I did do
Never visited the prison I was sent to
Post cards where we been to
I ain't mad I'm just sayin' that I miss you
Never diss you
Little ballad I can vent to
Realest place that I think I ever went to
Airin' out my issues
This song is wrote on with tissues
So if you...

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
If you ever wonder how I've been
In that picture frame on the side of your bed
I'm always thinkin' of you, my old friend
And now I'm just a ghost in your head
If you ever see me somewhere in town
Don't be afraid to come say hello now
We've been through it all
The ups and the downs
And even though I am all grown up now
I'm still your little man

[Verse 2: Struggle]
It's hard to keep my eyes clear
Ain't seen your face in 5 years
Not seeing you again is my fear
Life happen so fast I could die here
Straighten up, I can't cry here
Head high, eyes wide
I've been on the grind
And I know I ain't called in a while
Damn, I apologize
Black sheep, you always made me feel
Like the golden child, I'm whole now
But I'm reaching out
And if you're wondering
I'm still living everything that you always preached about
Kindlin' the fire that burnt deep
You tried to keep me out, but I turnt street
You planted seeds and I grew to be
But a thug but a man of integrity
See, the best of me is all you
Rest of me was all me
Can't blame yourself for what I've been through I was too wild for you to tend to
Forgiveness, I'm gon' give you, so forgive me or pretend to
Everything that I went through made me 10'2" so if you...

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
If you ever wonder how I've been
In that picture frame on the side of your bed
I'm always thinkin' of you, my old friend
And now I'm just a ghost in your head
If you ever see me somewhere in town
Don't be afraid to come say hello now
We've been through it all
The ups and the downs
And even though I am all grown up now
I'm still your little man...
I'm still your little man...
I'm still your little man...
I'm still your little man
