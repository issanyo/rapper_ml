[Verse 1]
Just another lonely night stuck in this hotel
The hallways quiet and the lobby is so empty
Broke that seal in the mini bar in my room
Looking for a lady to come spend time with me
She's sending me pictures to my iPhone
I can't lie girl, I am so impressed
Come show me how you get into your zone
See you in an hour, here's my hotel address
She brought a bottle of Jack D, oh my
Now that's one less thing I gotta go buy
She got a leather jacket and a t-shirt
She got cowboy boots and a mini skirt
She rolls up, asks do I mind
Baby I don't mind if you get high
Let's drink and smoke, yeah, that's alright
And tear this room apart all night

[Chorus]
Ohhhh, she got the good love
Ohhhh, she got the good love
No more leather jacket or a t-shirt
No more cowboy boots or a mini skirt
Ohhhh, she got the good love

[Verse 2]
She's a Beretta, no, more like a Smith and Wesson
Pull a Revolver, each bullet loaded with poison
Father, forgive your daughter, she came to me for the slaughter
I took no time for the second guess, I said yes and I oughta
Automatic, the heart's erratic, I'm radical at the radest
And smashin' that ass from the back and crackin' the packaging of a prophylactic
Fuckin' and suckin', soakin' up a mattress
I'm so in love with this moment, roll up the dope
And pack the bowl and fire it up
Be like cocaine, get wired up
Freaky-deeky-leeky, these sheets are getting tied up
[?] put your feet higher
You can do [?] I'll take you high up
I'm coming up out of a fuckin' pigeon hole
So let's get wicked and kick it and get a witness for a video
Give me a kiss up on your tippy toes
I'll put your back on the wall
Make you feel like a natural woman
I’m gunnin’, she’s runnin’, I'm gunnin’ until she cummin’
I teach what I preach, come meet the Chief for a sermon
Report back to your friends, give them a survey, a verdict
Give them a grade for the lay, but you ain't gotta encourage
The purrin' kitty cats, cuz if you give it, I give it back
I'm outta the city tomorrow, no need to get attached
Baby, my love is only skin deep
You keep a G, maybe when I come back
I'll see you and be friendly

[Pre-Chorus]
You got it bad, dont ya baby?
You got it bad, for me

[Chorus]
Ohhhh, she got the good love
Ohhhh, she got the good love
No more leather jacket or a t-shirt
No more cowboy boots or a mini skirt
Ohhhh, she got the good love
