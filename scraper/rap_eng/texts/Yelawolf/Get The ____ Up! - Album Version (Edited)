Though many have come
There will never be another one
Quite like
Yelawolf

Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up
Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up

Wraaa Daddy gonna pop that trunk
Yeah, battle ship sunk, throwing dirt rock chunks
Sling shot rocks broke no money lumps
Looking up too D boys with the pretty dunks
Slick sit down you ain't in the city chump
Special K make the kitties come
Get you some get many guns
Move 'em out ten toes pity none
Get your own Dixie won't give the dog a bone
Sitting' on bigger chrome yeah that's home
Bird fight pit fight what a good song
Looking at the world like what I do wrong
Nothing but a mailman truck coming back for the pickup
I'm a gift you can't get rid of
Recline on me homie I'm a make you sit up
Get drunk do it. Stage lights are lit up, scream like

Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up
Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up

Wraaa
Let the beat ride like that
Yeah I'm a thunderbird never coming back
Thunder in the trunk thunder in the dope sack
I serve em up thunder in the dope raps (BOOM)
Big 'llacs in the tall grass sit with the tires flat
Real good price buddy you should buy that
Blink and you might pass my town
Hole in the wall king my crown
Oh but of all things my sound
Is picking up like a 30 mile long train
Slow climb up but it's such a long drain
So how did I become up pick of all names
What a fairy tale like Ichabod Crane
The headless horsemen runnin' untamed like

Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up
Wraaa Everybody get the fuck up
