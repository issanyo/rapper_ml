[Verse 1: STS]
She could take the microphone and rock it out the socket like a spacely sprocket
We threw comets and commit taking bets on who'd hit a star
Some say even in dreams men don't get that far
And weather I be ass hole or astronaut I got to get to where you are
She the equivalent of two blunts worth in a glass jar
But I am merely a man whos thoughts spin round and round equivalent to a fan
I understand her love is seasonly dapper like daffodils
But fills me with chlorofil or until her petals fall over and leave
Uncommon theif she stole my heart with just a song with a dance
Sometimes she makes me want to forget who I am
I am a man and shes the star
I prey to the skies and shes worshiped by mars
How brave thou art to create thou art
Even Jesus knees touched bubble guts and freeze up when you ease up in Heaven like you do
Asked a Reverend how to get to you and he sent me through Hell
Kicked the pail high pitched and yelled through fits that failed in attempts to tell you how I feel
To me you are a star
A gift from God gifted by God
A pearl to us peas in a pod
It throws me that you would notice me as a tree through the fog
Of all the Pall Malls in the pack you put me over and put me back
And to think this is how I react

[Hook: Yelawolf]
Hey there sunshine
You smell like summertime
Can I unwind in your shade?
Hey there sunshine
Winters been hard on me
Feels like I made you wait

Hey there sunshine
You are my shooting star
We are a part of fait (okay, okay)
Hey there sunshine
Search for a brighter day
Sunshine don't be late

[Verse 2: STS]
Okay, please don't fade away
Eyes get misty like a rainy day
My blue skies not turning grey
So I prey and I prey that you won't be late
And I won't be safe till I get you back
When you gone my world go black
You know I'm strong, thats a well known fact
But I felt so alone when I can't hit that
And you can't hit this
And damn do I miss
You, like Rakim Allah miss fish
Cause Miss, you are my favourite dish
My Princess like Prince I kiss you
Cause lady you smell like sunshine
You got my love locked down like one time
I'm trying to get you in the middle like lunchtime
So I can eat you like 7, 8, 9
But everyday I'm up with the roosters
Know my heart must run with the boosters
Smoke my tree I need my purp
Lean on her like I need syrup
Hurts when your gone
I work when your gone
I stayed up waiting on ya all night long
And I'm so prone
To sit by the phone
Left the lights on hoping you come home
Try to move on but I just come back
Back to the beginning like the intro track
I'm in to deep
Where I can't sleep
So I don't dream about stuff, just think
And I just drink till the sun comes up
The moon goes down
The soon I found
The light of my life as the World goes round
So hey there sunshine don't come down

[Hook: Yelawolf]
Hey there sunshine
You smell like summertime

Hey there sunshine
Winters been hard on me
Feels like I made you wait

Hey there sunshine
You are my shooting star
We are a part of fait
Hey there sunshine
Search for a brighter day
Sunshine don't be late

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
You can catch me on saturday like a neon light, I bet
Im glowing like a clermont lounge marquee
Sippin on Jack buddy hand me the car keys
And if you ain't got well I bet I can find a set
Yup, Cause when I drive my sets
Cranked up, crunked up, fairmones hide what
Would I say if she says, well what would I pay?
I'm alive baby I dont get cheques till friday
Shes laughing it up as she buy me a drink
But I'm seeing through her cause I'm a product of instinct
Plus she's in pink
Fresh off the pole like a catfish, it stinks
Really depends on how you smell it though
Pinocchio can't lie, but I can though
Damn bro why you got to go make her pull the titty out?
Cause I'm Rambo I'll pull machetes out
I cut a path where others laugh and others rap
Like bitch, Yelawolf ain't taking no bubble bath
Go build a tent if the weather bad
Leave them outside like its quick for their system
Thats how I make it rain, thats what I give em
Water the grass like a dog cause I pissed em
Off, You rock a baby
Better get your balance before you try to play me
I ride a chevy this ain't no fucking mercedes
And if I'm in a fucking mercedes
It ain't cause I want to fuck with the ladies
It's the navigation that I like
And the steering wheels got a telephone alright?
Anyway, you might want to lay this pipe
Down the place where the sun don't shine
Cause it's late at night
