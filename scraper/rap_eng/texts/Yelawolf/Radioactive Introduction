The United States Army has issued a warning
Three nuclear bombs have been launched from North Korea
And will hit Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada;
And New York City, New York
This will expire at 5 o'clock AM Eastern Standard Time
Please get to an underground shelter or a fallout shelter immediately
Once again, three nuclear bombs have been launched from North Korea
And will hit Orlando, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada;
And New York City, New York
This warning will expire at 5 o'clock AM Eastern Standard Time

I am...
I am the American eagle, eyes of a sparrow
Right hand branch, left hand arrow
Chasin' a dollar, in an Impala
White trash heart throb, Mellow Yellow
Drinkin' hard liquor, brauds get on my level
I'm hotter than the bottom side of a whistlin' kettle
They threw a mountain at me, I got hit with a pebble
They sent me to hell, and I shit on the Devil
Try to bury my Chevy box but I won't buckle
And that's a deep hole bitch, bring a long shovel
Long gone, I'm grown up, and I'm gone cut you
But a grown lady, but if you want a blade, then holmes fuck you
Fuck you till you can't take a shit
Yeah I'm a fuck everybody, tsunami, better anchor the ship
Aim for the ankles and wrist, I came for the dangerous shit
I claimed to be named for the hits, the game is a chain that I grip
Slang from the pain of a trip it took to see Wayne in the whip
I became what I came to get the chains for the change I give
A quarter for your thought, appreciate the contribution
Slumerican, I'd depreciate the Constitution
Alleviate the crew when, I leave a page in ruins
To each his own, I guess I own each and every room in
The house I built is full of hopes, no ifs
So I stand with a giant like a king, no stilts
If I'm Generation X, I'm sellin' X, no pills
Dopeman choppin' up lines you don't sniff
Read 'em, I'm bringin' back booklets and hookless, lyrics
So you can be certain just in case you didn't hear it
But what he says, come again? what is that?
Come to Earth, touchdown, I might be your runnin' back
Because you hollered, run it back
Stay cool enough to wear toboggans as a Summer hat
Steady on the drum I rap, hope there's no one under that
Rock that I roll, mosh pit flow
Girls on your shoulders get topless at the shows
Fuck your mop and glow, can't mop a dirt road, it only makes mud
Raised around a deer, I know how to chase bucks
Babysitter, 16, taught me how to make fuck
At 7, I've been raisin' hell, so I can make it to Heaven
Pick up a 2 liter but I only need the plastic
Know how to make bombs with aluminum and acid
Butterfly Effect of a hurricane's magic, tornado path in
The rear view mirror of my '87 Classic
I'm talkin' about Gadsden, look mama no hands, I'm Radioactive
