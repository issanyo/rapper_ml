[Intro]
Yeah i’d like to sing you a little ditty

[Chorus: Fefe Dobson]
They should’ve never, ever let you out
Cold animal with a mouth from the South
What you gonna say, what you gonna do
As you know they comin', comin' after you
Watch out for the D-Boys
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it movin', big boy
You know they’re takin' shots at you
Cos you’re an animal, oh

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Here we go, Alabama's own buddy, Promenade
And I’m in the zone now, everybody
Bringin' em home baby, to the stage
Slick Rick E. Bobby in a Nascar
Runnin' over motherfuckers like I’m in a bar
Sentimental motherfuckers in a cookie jar
Be the late night snack I’m Santa Claus
Down in Panama beach, drunk in my underalls
Playin' underwear volleyball with your broad
I ain't bothered by your triple D's, not at all
Let me hold em up for ya baby while you walk
Wanna get the party bumpin' let me do my thing
Get the marijuana plant need watering
Throw it in a bong let it start bubbling
Know what I mean, Butter bean, Badda Badda Bing
Trashy white, pass the mic, yeah I’m doin' em dirty
Fists start pumpin' when I’m in the lights, like I’m rappin' in Jersey
Never get elegant
In elementary, never learned to write in cursive
Raised by the country B-Boys, I’m elegantly perfect
Rack it in, pack em in, to the back again, wrap it up
Rap it in, sicker than a pack of ten mini-thins
You’ll get when I win but I won’t lose
In fact I’m gonna win, win again with another hand
Here’s another hand, here’s another hand
Dealer, can I get another hand
Here's a hand, king king king king king
Bitch, Ghet-O-Vision in the Dirty South
And you know we're gettin' clean, rich yeah!

[Chorus: Fefe Dobson]
They should’ve never, ever let you out
Cold animal with a mouth from the South
What you gonna say, what you gonna do
As you know they comin', comin' after you
Watch out for the D-Boys
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it movin', big boy
You know they’re takin' shots at you
Cos you’re an animal, oh

[Verse 2]
Candy-coated whip, runnin' over candy coated rappers (Vroom!)
Panties on her drip, do a back flip for me baby be an acrobatic actor (Action!)
Do a cart wheel on a bar
Will you do a cart wheel while I chill on a bar stool
Will I throw a dart at a wet seal
Well if I see a whale I’m a throw a fuckin' harpoon
Go Looney Toons, and lose your fruit of the looms
To prove you’re in the room, you’re shroomin' to the moon
But in the mornin' you’re wakin' up like a broom
Swept off your feet cause Yelawolf ain't a groom
I ain’t poppin' the cherry, I’m poppin' berry
Moonshine, hop in the bedroom let's move
If you wanna compare me, compare me
To a legend don’t compare me to a young fool
Go get a gun, go get a gun, I'll get a Cinnabun, now sit upon your fuckin' roof
I live it son, I get it done, fuck anyone
Yeah fuck anyone who ain't fuckin' with the crew
Yeah throw another bucket in the pool, dry it out now everybody skate
Cause I’m a lord, I'mma doggytown, (WOLF!) A.L.A.B.A.M.A, my state
My state of my mind 1985 wide body, lookin' for the little small town keg party
Wanna get drunk, wanna fall up in a hottie, get shitty like a porta-potty
So, jump on the paddy wagon like a Pakistani
Packin' a Mac 11, with a pack of maniacs, 11:30
Back at it again, I'm ready for the battle, when and where muthafucka?
They let another cracker in, yeah!

[Chorus: Fefe Dobson]
They should’ve never, ever let you out
Cold animal with a mouth from the South
What you gonna say, what you gonna do
As you know they comin', comin' after you
Watch out for the D-Boys
Watch out for the boys in blue
You better keep it movin', big boy
You know they’re takin' shots at you
Cos you’re an animal, oh
