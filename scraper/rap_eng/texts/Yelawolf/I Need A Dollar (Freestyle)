[Intro]
Gadsden, Alabama water park
It's the first
AsTheWorldSpins.com mixtape
DJ Hotsauce, DJ Jelly
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Sunday morning and the priests are saying save yourself
Catfish is doing things in the Bible Belt
DJ Jelly, Yelawolf is on it
Country boys are dropping heat again Doggone it
Call the Chevys out I'm riding for the dunks again
Going out to all my homies with the trunks again
Yah I'm on shallow black buddy buddy it's on
I need a dollar cmon' uh
Pardon the future buddy
Excuse the fuse
Look for the bomb baby please check the room
Can't reject the broom, I'm a born street sweeper
Dropping on beats like a born meat cleaver
Leave it to beaver
I'll leave you with a pot of gold
Drained up the creek like a hip hop swimming hole
Dive in headfirst
Weak ones go leg first
I got that dirty bong water I can make a dredger
Look at the lead work
A tundra from the number two
Above you like the color blue
Look up to your cloud now
Another story for your website to talk about
Retweet retweet internet it blog about it
Yeah that's me homie
Mullet to the back, yeah
What I'm 'bout to do with all this culture
It's like lemonade
Squeeze it, drink it, sell it, hustle hard
Running over rappers like a big block, muscle car
Beez in a honey jar
Let me get a hold of that
I run into an hour journey class and take off your cap
Racing through my city, no sweat, take off my cap
Home is where I lay it down, gotta leave my hat
Anywhere I move I'm looking to be meeted back
Seeds in the stash, keys in the 'Lac
Tornado flow, a breeze in fact
Holler atcha' homie, ever seen a slum crowning?
Move horsie I ain't fucking with no dumb pony
Hoes jump on it, do slang to it
Through color poppin', working class music
Work-working class music
[Outro]
DJ Jelly, Hotsauce
You wanna know what I put Jelly and Hotsauce on?
Look at these uninteractive motherfuckers though
You tried dealing with them in studio?
I put Jelly and Hotsauce on chicken biscuits
All on the same time
It's Yelawolf I'm happy to be here
Thank for having me
This is AsTheWorldSpins.com mixtape
I might not even make the cut cuz of that shit
Psych, you know Catfish, holler
