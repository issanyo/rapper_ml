Lets rip this bitch up

[Verse 1: Kurt Rock]
Lets Start from the basics 1, 2, 3
Got put in jail threw away the key & don't let you pee. In the backseat of a corvette 2 Beers & 1 pound of Weed. Don't know if you should do Em & drive or tell the cops. So he does nothing then gets it blamed on him & get 10 to Life. Now he can't even see his 3 kids & wife What a life, don't know if I should get advise from someone who is friends with drug dealers or in jail. It just seems like a gateway to HELL. Just locked in the cell. Just hope you don't drop the soap. You won't be well later because you'll be fucked literally

[Hook: Lil Jon & YelaWolf]
