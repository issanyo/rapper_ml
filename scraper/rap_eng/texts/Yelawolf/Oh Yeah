[Hook: Mr. Finley]
Here the hell I am, there the fuck I go
When I step up in it, guarantee you finna know
They say yeah, oh yeah, they're going yeah, fuck yeah
My nigga ay
This is who I am, this is how I go
And every time I get up in that booth or rock a show
They're going yeah, oh yeah, they're going, yeah fuck yeah
My nigga ay

[Verse 1: Mr. Finley]
I like you, [?]
I only came for the bitches to jock
I brought some live-wires with me and they're ready to pop
Any disrespect we're turning up to the top
I fuck with players, you work with haters
So that make you a hater by association
I west coast it
Bitch rollerskating, feeling like a President
When I lead we motorcading
The total package, batteries included
Sorry producer, I  [?] your music
I have to do it, the whole world watchin'
Catch me in the sky, probably while you birdwatchin' (there I go)
I'm up-up and away
I don't need a phone number , I am fucking today
And you can bet that when I come that I ain't comin' to play
Who got a problem? Who want drama? Who got something to say?
Ay

[Hook: Mr. Finley]
Here the hell I am, there the fuck I go
When I step up in it, guarantee you finna know
They say yeah, oh yeah, they're going yeah, fuck yeah
My nigga ay
This is who I am, this is how I go
And every time I get up in that booth or rock a show
They're going yeah, oh yeah, they're going, yeah fuck yeah
My nigga ay

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
You don't wanna see me do it, do you?
You don't wanna see the truth of music
Lick for the crack of the (worthless) circus
Fuckin' up the way that people cruise to music
But give me the news and I lose it
Shoot at a muthafucka like who blew it?
Fuck it like use it, you could use the improvement
Spin a circle [?] underneath my Jay
Fuck [?]  tree I'mma roll in with a 30-pack of [?]
Come jump in the bayou
I boogie down to the bottom, hater
Instead of saying fuckin' Alabama, you'll be screamin' fuckin alligator!
Yeah buddy I'm off the chain, I'm off the train, I'm running loose
How did I become off the train?
'Cause I'm an engine with long caboose
I'm an indian, I'm a Cherokee too
I'm a white boy, an Amerian youth
So, who needs the proof?
If you wanna Bud Light I'll give you tattoo
[?]
In an alleyway with another alley oop
Put medicine through the neck
The game is sick, I'm a bowl of soup
So, what's up player?
You're looking down, you don't know, what's up player?
But I'm looking like I wanna know, what's up there?
Drop another verse
Jump outta the booth like

[Hook: Mr. Finley]
Here the hell I am, there the fuck I go
When I step up in it, guarantee you finna know
They say yeah, oh yeah, they're going yeah, fuck yeah
My nigga ay
This is who I am, this is how I go
And every time I get up in that booth or rock a show
They're going yeah, oh yeah, they're going, yeah fuck yeah
My nigga ay

[Verse 3 Mr. Finley]
This that shit that make them motherfuckers go crazy
Such a Vegas baby, somebody ace of spade me
Point me to the stage, cut my fuckin' music up
I am here for your enjoyment, use me 'til you use me up
I'm cool as what? Frigerator, winter weather
[?] winter fresher, I've been popping since forever
Can't nobody rip it better
I'll rip it to shreds, I do it 'til death
I'll kill it it's dead
GOV and I ain't talking to government
2011, Ghet-O-Vision bitch, we runnin' shit
Goin' HAM on you niggas and we make that change like man in the mirror
I am macaroni, I am Mr. Finley
I am spokesperson, I have spoken for my city
We here, goin' nowhere, tell you I'm going nowhere
As long as I got that mic I'mma rap that bitch and make 'em
Oh Yeah

[Hook: Mr. Finley]
Here the hell I am, there the fuck I go
When I step up in it, guarantee you finna know
They say yeah, oh yeah, they're going yeah, fuck yeah
My nigga ay
This is who I am, this is how I go
And every time I get up in that booth or rock a show
They're going yeah, oh yeah, they're going, yeah fuck yeah
