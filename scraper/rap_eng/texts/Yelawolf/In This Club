[Intro]
Ghetto Vision and we about to set this bitch off, burn one

[Hook x2]
Smoke some bud, smoke some bud
In this club, in this club
Do some drugs, do some drugs
In this club, in this club
Roll it up, roll it up
In this club, in this club
Let's get drunk, let's get drunk
In this club, in this club

[Verse 1]
Yelawolf's in this bitch now
PBR’s on deck, I don’t put twenty-four down
I’m about to lose it, somebody bring me a bucket
And another PBR so I can party till the early morning with my people
You got the green sack of kush day buy that shit up
Bounce bitches bounce in this club
You’ve got to give up don’t be a fool look it
Everybody's smokin' the truth of a Yelawolf
Drop drop drop eh eh eh

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Holding myself on the wall
The room is spinning too much of cheap alcohol
But I’m still grinnin' we all know how this shit go
When you ain’t got to go to work until the end of every weekend
It’s time to get crazy
I gotta piss but the line is too fucking long
What should I do go outside or pull my thing on out
And piss right here right now
I put a puddle in the middle of the floor and walk away like
I had nothing to do with it hey here I go

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Can’t you see that my chain is
Off of the squad get loose as a goose and buckwild
Like David Crockett out of the woods I have come
Onto the party with a fifth of Jimmy Walka
And the ghetto vision family ah
Don’t fuck around with my folks
Might get that head bust like or right amaka toe
You best to catch up when we come through
We got women everywhere that wanna give us all the pussy buddy
Why you lookin' stupid, stupid?

[Hook x2]
