[Verse 1]
Well hello folk, how are you today? (Hey!)
I'm terrific actually; doing ok
Usually irritated by what people say
I'm doing better cause my radio don't play
(Your radio don't play?)
Nope, guess it fell apart with
Heartless music or useless artists
Don't be a tool or a target
Hey be a fruit for the harvest
That's right: oranges, grapes not lemons
Be smart, articulate your rhythm
Instead of creating, they giving
Sounds that go to imitate theses children
Trends become laughable at times
Follow and become laughable in your lines (Idea!)
Y'all are so wrong
Straighten up mister

[Hook]
(Leave them kids alone)
And the beat goes on
Talent switched off but the ego's on
(All and all its just another brick in the wall)
Well people dying to ball
But they ain't trying at all
They just lying to y'all
And the truth is
(All and all you're just another brick in the wall)

[Verse 2]
How many Chucks can a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood
Well if you give Chuck a buck he'll buy wood pre-cut
Hard work, Chuck ain't used to it
Chuck's daddy got a caddy
Cause he used to work the alley
Chucking wood daily for the fiends
Bought a home with a yard
Chuck seems thawed
Now he's living out daddy's dream
So many lames like Chuck fucking hip-hop up
Hip-hop's not dead, its just frozen and crushed
With diamonds and such
With labanous sluts
Babbling bought what?
I don't even know what
I don't even hold much rap shit; I'm gone
More likely I move with rappers who ain't on
I'm clapping for the songs they diss before long
They dig this shit, man, I just

[Hook]
(Leave them kids alone)
And the beat goes on
Talent switched off but the ego's on
(All and all its just another brick in the wall)
Well people dying to ball
But they ain't trying at all
They just lying to y'all
And the truth is
(All and all you're just another brick in the wall)

[Interlude]
It's that time! Wake up!
Holler at G!
Oh, he got 'em!

[Verse 3]
I'm Catfish Billy and I feel so clean
Cause my music's fresh and so is my team
I flow with this heat but I ain't blowing no steam
I'm keeping this train moving
How I'm proving to be valuable to two or three
And I'm proven to me
Honestly I'm a breeze
Cause what I say on my piece
Is a piece of my world
This is culture I'm giving to you
Listen!
And these bitches on this new wave shit
But they wave white flags when the melee hits
When they say hits, ain't no classics
Ain't no last dibs cause they done did that, pimp
Detonate that roll
Ain't no milk in the bowl
Feeling like you wanna laugh, ha, give it a go!
You're inviting little homies and you're 40-years-old?
Go jump off a building, Superman that, ho

[Hook]
