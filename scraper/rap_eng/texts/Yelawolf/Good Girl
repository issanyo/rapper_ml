[Intro: Yelawolf]
This ain't for the good girls gone bad
This one's for the bad girls tryna go good

[Hook: Poo Bear]
How can someone like me so bad get such a good girl
Such a good girl, you're a good girl
And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl
Like I could, girl, like my good girl

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Here I go again, on my shit again
Walkin' through the mall, actin' like a prick again
You had a halter top, I had my famous socks
You came to shop, I came to ho hop
You had your girl with you, both lookin' great
I wanted both of y'all, how 'bout a double take
She was hatin', lookin' at me like a scumbag
But something made you wanna turn around and come back
Probably cause I just don't give a fuck
I just wanna' see one of these hookers in my truck
So tell your girlfriend "tough luck"
She just wanna see you with somebody dressed up
Well, I really ain't into that type of shit
I'm into tattoos, drinkin' til 6
Fuckin' til 9, sleepin' til 12
And going back to my homies with a story to tell

[Hook: Poo Bear]
How can someone like me so bad get such a good girl
Such a good girl, you're a good girl
And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl
Like I could, girl, like my good girl

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
This shit should've been finished
I'm as surprised as you are that you still let me in it
But you continue to text message me
Right after sayin' that we should both move separately
But you don't wanna see me go
Even though I'm only givin' you dick and cold cereal
So you must have a thing for Lucky Charms
Or the bad girl in you just fell in my lucky arms
You love to cuss me out and call me crazy
Say I'm no good and all of your friends hate me
Then you show up to my room and damn near rape me
And then it goes from "fuck you" to "fuck me baby"
You leave early so nobody sees you out the spot
Now you stuck between a hard place and a rock
You call me a player but I have lied to you not
Cause I'm not a player, I just crush a lot
Holler!

[Hook: Poo Bear]
How can someone like me so bad get such a good girl
Such a good girl, you're a good girl
And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl
Like I could, girl, like my good girl

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
I'm in jail again, on my Johnny Cash
Some dude was talkin' shit, I had to whip his ass
Called you in the mornin' and you just fuckin' laughed
You think this cute, you love my crazy ass
And I wonder if you'll ever leave my side
Cause the more that I ignore you, the more you wanna ride
I tell you that I'm bad but you never ask why
Cause you just want the good from a really bad guy
You wanna rock, let's rock and roll, just know
I'm only good at one thing and that's not control
But I am consistent, that's somethin' to be proud of
Cause I ain't shit with you and I ain't shit without you

[Hook: Poo Bear]
How can someone like me so bad get such a good girl
Such a good girl, you're a good girl
And I know that I don't treat you like I should, girl
Like I could, girl, like my good girl

[Outro: Yelawolf]
To all the bad girls, tryna' be good
No such thing as a good girl gone bad
Just a bunch of bad girls tryna' go good
Holler at me, mane
Hello, my name is Yelawolf
I'm a sex addict, it's a disease
There's medication for it and everything
I take pills
