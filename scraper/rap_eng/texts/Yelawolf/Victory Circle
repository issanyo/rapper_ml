Victory Circle

[Chorus]

Long-neck bottle in the victory circle
Checkered flag hanging over my shoulder
Running these roads and revving my motor
Look at this first place trophy I hold up
I'm a winner, mane
(If you ain't first, you're last)
I'm a winner, mane
(The loser don't get cash)
I'm a winner, mane
(And now I'm on top)
I'm a winner, mane
('Cos I gave it all that I got)
(Catfish)

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I do believe in miracles, you know, I got this feeling
That somehow I had this coming, like I was supposed to win
And become better than the normal driver rappers, skater, hate you
No, it don't come easy but with faith I played the game
And when you see me dancing, jumping, celebrating [?]
It's the reason that you see me holding trophies
So to know me is to love me, and if you feel above me
Then show me, I do not hold my people down below me
I'm only holding longnecks

[Chorus]

Long-neck bottle in the victory circle
Checkered flag hanging over my shoulder
Running these roads and revving my motor
Look at this first place trophy I hold up
I'm a winner, mane
(If you ain't first, you're last)
I'm a winner, mane
(The loser don't get cash)
I'm a winner, mane
(And now I'm on top)
I'm a winner, mane
('Cos I gave it all that I got)
(Catfish)

[Verse 2]
Dedicating
To all my big crews running tyres and popping gas
Cleaning windshields, running drills and running trash
Yelawolf loves you, the reason I can hold the gold
Is solely up to who controls the show (big shouts)
To my wife and kids, who [?] and told me when
When we didn't have a [?]
Now we piss when we want to on the fence
In the yard of the crib, on the tyre of a Benz
Got a quarter pound in the [?] freezer
Just so everybody blowing [?] on MTVs
I've had my gator breethe
Some folks have had their turn but now the ribbon is for me (gimme two)

[Bridge]

So here's the money that I borrow, ten supermodels
A brand new car you can run for a [?]
Very young little [?]
Simply 'cos I'm loyal and your problems, I can solve them

[Chorus]

Long-neck bottle in the victory circle
Checkered flag hanging over my shoulder
Running these roads and revving my motor
Look at this first place trophy I hold up
I'm a winner, mane
(If you ain't first, you're last)
I'm a winner, mane
(The loser don't get cash)
I'm a winner, mane
(And now I'm on top)
I'm a winner, mane
('Cos I gave it all that I got)
(Catfish)
