[Intro: Yelawolf and Gucci Mane]
Yeah (burr)
Go white girl, it's ya birthday
Go white girl, it's ya birthday
Yelawolf Mane, and Gucci
Go white girl, it's ya birthday
Yelawolf Mane, and Gucci
Holler at Jermaine

So I got this twelve pack (burr)
We blowing smoke in the air, drinking ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear saying, she just wanna party

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Trunk Muzik got these boppers poppin' on the Richter scale
D boys on the corner droppin' quarters like a wishing well
Ziplock in the freezer like yo momma’s box of zinfandel
Sip it with ya southern belle, bet ya she won't kiss and tell
Bit them black, I'm mister pale
Pack the pack and drink the ale
Getting drunk, I’m drunk as hell
Don’t think I can leave my chair
Got a tooth brush for the dirty mouth muthafuckin rappers
You don’t wanna see me there
Blindside 'em, blindside 'em, bitch I’ll leave you reading braille
You can’t Lady Gaga me, don’t bother with the poker face
I come from the bottom, you ain't gotta put ya dope away
Got so many hook ups I could pull the muthafuckin train
Kitchen full of bottles baby, tell me what you want again

[Chorus]
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowing smoke in the air, drinking ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin'
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowing smoke in the air, drinking ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear saying
I just wanna party

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Get wasted, too wasted, so wasted it's scary
Yellow canaries in my ear, they pretty
Let's party like its 1960, I’m the E A Jimmy Hendrix
Now the hip I'ma hippopotamus, I’m Rollin up that rhinoceros
She's jocking and it's obvious, I land in your metropolis
Don’t know who the baby’s father is, but I don’t owe no apologies
She just want a Harley, I’m rollin up the Marley, I’m drunk as Paul McCartney
I’m Gucci Mane not pootie tang, I put it down, don’t pick it up
Advice to you, don’t pick on us, Me and Yelawolf got crazy guns
We came here with 5 of 'em, we gon leave here with 9 of 'em
That’s 14, I’m keepin 'em around, I’m goin 'til I get tired of 'em

[Chorus]
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowing smoke in the air, drinking ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin'
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowing smoke in the air, drinking ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear saying
I just wanna party

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Cocaine on the table, Rittz the Rapper got'em choppin lines
Twenty doller bills all rolled up, Wiz Khalifa's rollin' pot
Jackie Chain is rollin' rollin', Yelawolf is pourin' pourin'
Slow motion got hoes in motion, I think it’s the perfect time
To put 'em in the mood, to put 'em in the car
Take 'em to the house and (what?)
Take her to the room, take it to the mouth
How we do it down south (what?)
I’m always going going
Ghet-O-Vision is sewing, plowing, growing, growing
Cropdusting from a Boeing
Catfish Billy, on ya grill (ey)
Cook it up, make a milli
Gettin stupid, gettin silly
Drinking beer (ey), also chilly
Fucked up but I’ll tell you that I can't complain
Yelawolf and Gucci Mane keepin yo bitch entertained

[Chorus]
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowing smoke in the air, drinking ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear sayin'
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
I just wanna party
We blowing smoke in the air, drinking ice cold beer
Got ya girl in my ear saying
I just wanna party

Bama!
We just wanna party (Hah Hah Hah)
Yellow, Gucci (BURR)
That’s hard
