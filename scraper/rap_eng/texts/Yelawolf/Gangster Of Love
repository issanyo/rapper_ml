[Intro]
Calling all cars, calling all cars
There is a gangster on the loose
He is very heavily armed and legged
And considered extremely dangerous
If you should happen to see him on your way home
Do not attempt to apprehend
I repeat, do not attempt to apprehend
Simply say "it's cool"

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Would the real Slim Shady please stand up
And tell these muthafuckers why I got signed?
'Cause I’m on the verge of slapping one of these white boys
Out here tryna imitate my grind
And if you feel offended when I say that
Fuck you, say something back
What do I gotta lose?
I’m already the underdog
Why wouldn’t I give you the opportunity to rap? Fuckboy
I’m harder than your momma’s fuck toy
And she’s still bitching
I’m sicker than a chicken sitting in shit
Sticking itself with a syringe in a Japanese kitchen, get some
I got the kinky bitch: get crumbs
Yeah, here the Shady clique come
They say I’m a dickhead, well it fits, why?
'Cause I'mma fuck this pussy ass game up till she gets numb
Any of many styles that I pick from
Fuck it, just give me kick drums
'Cause Yelawolf ain't a rapper
I’m a cataclysmic, culturally offensive, don’t-give-a-shit bum
It's done, so put ya money on a ‘Bama boy
20 West of Atlanta boy
You wanna ride in my lane
Prepare for the 18 wheeler winds
Get a grip on the bicycle handlebars

[Hook]
All the girls I meet (better handle yours)
Are falling down them stairs
Said getting themselves together
They getting themselves together
That's why they call me
Gangster of love
Yelawolf and I'm
On top, don’t wonder why
'Cause I'm rock and roll
Stop, drop and roll
That's why they call me
Gangster of love
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
'Cause I'm rock and roll
Stop, drop and roll
That's why they call me

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Hold up, my God
Let me pull the Chevrolet out the garage
I’m killin 'em A to Z lately, KP
You might get a hicky from Nicki Minaj
Fuck 'em all with a sandpaper dick
I dare anybody to come match him to this
You couldn’t hold a flame to my name bitch
I wouldn’t even let you hold a bic to my cancerous stick
I’m treating rappers like loose change
The shoe string belts that I lost in the cracks of my couches
Like I didn’t even know I had that until you made it
At least you bit what I came out with
Oh, you want some of the south shit?
Well let me show you what the south is
You into sucking dick
Well I’m into getting rich buddy
We could make a good team
Put your money where your mouth is

[Hook]
All the girls I meet (oh, you doubtin'?)
Are falling down them stairs
Said getting themselves together
They getting themselves together
That's why they call me
Gangster of love
Yelawolf and I'm
On top, don’t wonder why
'Cause I'm rock and roll
Stop, drop and roll
That's why they call me
Gangster of love
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
'Cause I'm rock and roll
Stop, drop and roll
That's why they call me

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
I'm all out in a two top two seater
Looking like an American missle seeker
Got back cat packs in my dungarees
Yeah, I’mma light a fuse under the disbeliever
Say you don’t give a shit good
'Cause I don’t give two shits neither
You better let it go, I’m already at your funeral
Walking with a rose like Wiz Khalifa
Yessir, I’m bona fied
I’mma go ahead and live 'cause I know I’m gonna die
And if you want a lift, baby get up in the whip
I don’t know what I can give but I know I’m gonna try
Whatever it is girl you know I’m gonna buy
But you know that's a fib, yeah, you know that's a lie
What a bayou, drive through Popeyes
Do you want it grilled or do you want it fried? Ah
I’m doing this like I knew I would
And you did too, so you knew you did
If I never got a co-sign I'll be at your throat
'Cause I'm dope and it don’t matter who I’m with
Repping that area code 256
White trash girls wink with blue eyelids
Because they know Yelawolf can’t be fucked with
But it don’t take an asshole to see that shit

[Hook]
All the girls I meet (that's kinda sick)
Are falling down them stairs
Said getting themselves together
They getting themselves together
That's why they call me
Gangster of love
Yelawolf and I'm
On top, don’t wonder why
'Cause I'm rock and roll
Stop, drop and roll
That's why they call me
Gangster of love
Feet on the ground
Head in the sky
'Cause I'm rock and roll
Stop, drop and roll
That's why they call me
