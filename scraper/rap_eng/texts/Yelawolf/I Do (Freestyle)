[Yelawolf]

[Intro]
My name is Yelawolf, some of them call me "Catfish Billy"
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do rip shit
I do, I do, I do, I do...yeah, let's go
Yeah, yeah, yeah

First of I'm a King so don't you, be the Jester in my Kingdom
Hip-Hop's like another pair of old shoes, I jus' took a toothbrush and cleaned 'em
Put 'em on, rocked 'em to the mall, hopped in the car, while a sipped on "Jimmy Beamin'"
Instead of droppin' the ball, a got 'em all, up on the wall like a broomstick leanin'
Then a put the Chevy in cruise, took everybody to etiquette school
Listen up baby they said "you don't have a clue", it ain't fuck you, it's..FUCK YOU!!
If your gonna fight, then you fight shirtless
You don't ride a bike in sandals do you (no)
The meaning of fuck is worthless, if it don't mean nothin' to ya'
Yeah..just get it warmed up
Why does everybody look so perplexed?
If your gonna do it, do it with a purpose, thats all then do it all till its perfect
Funky I am, so funky that a use my vocal stretch
Why would you stretch with funk? (MASTER FLEX)
So a don't pull a hamstring while am runnin' circles around circus clowns in my jeans
Cause when a pull the trigger on a piece of paper a can hear the bullet in studio go "ping-ping"
A can feel the breeze of the flow blow wing yes look, hear the chequebook go "ching-ching"
Bring bring me the money honey yeah, go go girl, why she tellin' me to go go sing?

A take that trip down the road to your soul
Am not a vocalist but a got some vocal control
Three-Thirty-Three this ones for you and a hope that you know
We gonna' shake this motherfucker till both of us old
Until my baby's far away out in Puerto-Rico
Daddy's out workin' but your with me wherever we go
Mamma's ok and plus we got us 3 beautiful souls
And above it all a want y'all to see me as a hero
No ego, no ego, this freestyle, is a peephole, of people, for the people
Come inside, take a seat folks, here we go, no ego, no ego, this freestyle, is a peephole, of people, for the people
Come inside, take a seat folks

Yeah, 2012, am 32 killin' shit bitch, for Shady Records, know that shit
South as it is bitch
Funkmaster Flex whats up homie?
