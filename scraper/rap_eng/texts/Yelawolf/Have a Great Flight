[Intro]
Where's my calling angel?
At the coffin
Where's my blue sky?
At the coffin
A pretty bouquet and a red rose
At the coffin
Darling, don't cry
At the coffin
Over my soul

[Verse 1]
I will take your favorite books, and put them in a row
I remember how you like them, I know where they go
Your mama will be waiting there, for you to hold
I know that she misses you, misses you so

[Chorus]
So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose
You have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose

[Verse 2]
I will keep the memories, that always make me smile
But letting you go, honestly, I'm havin' a tough time
But I promise I'll be strong for you, like you said, and hold it in the road
But, I'll be down here missing you, missing you so

[Chorus]
So have a great flight
Have a great flight outta here, I suppose
I know you raised me right, but you must go, I suppose

[Bridge]
And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I’m in the next room but is it gonna be long
Until I see you again
And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I’m in the next room but is it gonna be long
Until I see you again
And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I’m in the next room but is it gonna be long
Until I see you again
And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I’m in the next room but is it gonna be long
Until I see you again
And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I’m in the next room but is it gonna be long
Until I see you again
And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I’m in the next room but is it gonna be long
Until I see you again
And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I’m in the next room but is it gonna be long
Until I see you again
And nothing ever did feel so real but this time
My time, my mind is gone, turn the lights back on
Baby I’m in the next room but is it gonna be long
Until I see you again
