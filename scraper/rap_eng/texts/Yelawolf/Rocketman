[Hook]
Up up and away
Take me away
Light-speed on the game
To know where I come from, is to know it's all the same

[Verse One]
Gimme a match and I'll light that fire
Little bitta' gasoline and I'll hit that star
Battle Galatic-uh on a wire
Enterprise is bound to go higher

Up up and away!
Ain't nobody handin' shit out but a lock and chain
When ya locked and loaded in a boxing ring
I got this game in a box of things

But as for now man, I'm stuck on this earth
Build my pad as a vessel man I'mma make this shit WORK!

Bottle up dreams, swallow up beams(?), lightning strikes clean
So when this shit hits I'll be ready for it with a pair of metal jeans
Triple beam kerosene dreams
Barely seen fiends
Carelessly embarrassed outta their parents
'Clarance(?) has a dream'

High in the clouds
Push and puff bubble kush right to the mouth
Can't live life in the hall
About to take off
Thank god
Take off right now!

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Night owl style, I'm a wild child
Eat air, shit clouds
I run 'em out in my house
What I'm talkin' is POW POW!

Cut out the top of a ceiling
Got a hole in my house it's another feeling
Stuck in the stars, (?)
Buckle up man I think I'm teething

But as for now man, I'm stuck on this earth
Build my mic as a vessel I'mma make this shit work

I'm outta this world
Can't nobody compare me to these Earls
Carelessly I be thorough
Think about the next stop guess pot pit stop I REFILL

I keep ill, I eat skills
I climb mountains I need thrills
Keep a couple dollar bills under my collar
So when I pop know that I don't mean pills!
Oh be real! Homie chill!
Only kill to open deals

I take off and leave, naw(?)
I can't hear y'all like Evander Holyfield

[Hook] x2

Up up and away!
Rocketman, Rocketman!
Up up and away
Pack my bags, pack my bags!
X2

Lets go lets go (Lightspeed on the game)
All y'all lames, all y'all lames (Know that it's all the same)
X2


Up up and away!
Rocketman, rocketman!
Up up and away
Pack my bags, pack my bags!
