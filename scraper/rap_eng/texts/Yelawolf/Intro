Water

[Lil Jamie]
For those of you who don't know what creek water is
I'll explain
When the oceans of lake culture
The ocean of war
Separation
Religion
And creation
From this ocean we call society
And into the seas
From the seas to the lake
And from the lakes to the rivers
From the rivers to the streams
And finally from the streams
To the creeks

Creek water

The last to see
The last to hear
And the last to know

From the oceans to the streams
From the valley down to the river
Mama said it all comes down to creek water
