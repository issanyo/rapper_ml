[Verse 1]
Ok im be spittin my flow
All you haters should know
That im comin out the best
Im beter than all the rest cuz

Im the king i wear the crown
Start off on yo block then take yo town
I got the muscles got the pecs
You better watch yo mouth cuz i write yo checks
I'll have you on the floor better yet the concrete
Im sittin on my throne have you haters bowin to my feet

[Verse 2]
Now let me show you how a player can flow
You rap like an avarge joe
Now watch a great me drop my hit
When this battle done you'll have a fit

[Yelaeolf verse 3]
"What the fuck does it matter to me
Cause after me the only be
Is wanna bees and mostly
Ain't never gunna bees"(yelawolf)
