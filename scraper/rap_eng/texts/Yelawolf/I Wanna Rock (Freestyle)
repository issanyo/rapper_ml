[Intro]
What's up motherfuckers?

[Verse: Yelawolf]
It's your Yelawolf partner catfish bizzle got these ho's poppin
Poppin up like an echo
Keep them gassed up yeah I'm pumping them with the petrol
Nickle bag dippin I'll meet ya down at the Citgo
Yeah I sell a little
Yeah that's how I lick em'
Yeah that's what I give them
Yeah that's how I sick em'
Throwing a hot potatoe these hot potatoes
I ship em from a bucket I lift them these home fries
I hit em ketch up you hungry then you better lick em
You wanna see a cracker up close there's a picked one
Speaking of a picked one we get up crunk way it up freestyles bitch I Can make a ton
Rappers like football it's a tricky punt but kick it up crimson tides Already won
Bistro I'm a deadly gun rat rat rat pussy boy you a ready cunt don't Make me reach for my machette son
I cut students cut two bucks like I was Jackie Chan
Or Jackie chain pull back and bang I'm droppin change with a hand full Of thoughts like I had a second brain
So go head and take a crack at Wayne it won't drop that's a gun shot And you lack at aim
From the back of the train to the caboose ya
Pull em out the game
Fuck bits I pull em out of the strange
Fuck it I pull them out of there lane
Now your playing chicken with a hot rod
Oh my god I went with a metal frame faggots you need a training bra Just look at how your titties hang
I'm a grown man I just let my nuts swang
Bust another tooth ahh that's another hockey puck slang how you get ice In alabama mane
Cause I'm the fucking truth god bitch I freeze anything refrigerator Parry is back again
Spread grey pupone all over your fucking cellaphane
I'm serving yellow like the dope mane
Figure this mutha fucka like cold train
Middle finger thumb hear my pain when the horns blow it's like a porn Show I'm buck naked hip hop will never be the same
