[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Tell me can you handle it
Me downtown like a vandalist
You know whiteboys eat pussy like a sam-a-witch
Mmm like the sound of it
Let my tounge move around a bit
Shit better smell like ice cream though if it don’t then I won’t go down on it
But if it does I might drown in it
Mike Phelps all around in it
Backstroke, butterfly, have you on the bed scramblin'
Let me sip on this crown and then
A six pack and then sit back
Okay miss cat can I kiss that
Where them lips at

[Hook: Diamond]
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat

[Verse 2: Diamond]
Now tell me can you handle this
I preach this evangelist
My pussy’s like a cannabis
That’s why they say I’m scandalous
Cuz I’ve been know to fuck a nigga never call him if he wet
Ain’t go be no sticky if he quickie where they do that at
I’m sorry I’m not cool with that
I just want the tongue and mouth
Open up and say ah you know what I’m talking bout
A-T-L-A-N-T-A G-A just taste my Georgia peach
All my reese's pieces you can eat me to I fall asleep

[Hook: Diamond]
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
I don’t wanna gas you up
But I give you the pump like a flat does
Take you to the back of the mack truck
And put the rock in you like a mashup

[Diamond]
While you talking about gassin up
I’ll park it up in your mustache
Come quick, rush fast
You wanna ride on this you need a bus pass

[Yelawolf]
Fuck that, I got a fresh shave
Got the bed made,and a pack of smokes
Tongue lash, next wait
Till the next day, I’m a natural

[Diamond]
Abracadabra magical
I snap you chest for collateral
5'1, brown eyes, nice ass
I walk the walk and I talk trash

[Yelawolf]
Talk trash I like that
I’m a hefty bag incredible
Hold your legs up Indian style
Let me be chief lapahoe

[Diamond]
Sex so good I’m you antidote
Eat me long time cantaloupe
Lick me up like a envelope
Cuz I ride a mean ass banana boat

[Hook: Diamond]
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
Lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat, lick the cat
