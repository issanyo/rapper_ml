[Verse 1: Paul Wall]
Rolling with the top down, on peanut butter guts
Trolling, I'm about to clown
Let me go and turn the bass up (Turn it up)
Holding that Glock nine, in case a hater run up
Golden, I'm the shit now, so your bitch on my nuts
I got my car smoking, but it ain't the motor
It's just me and that dodo
These bops strolling, I stop and poke 'em
But I'm trying to get that dough, ho
Ridin' dirty, ain't no hobo
It's just me strapped up like a GoPro
And I'm one deep; Han Solo
Laws trying to capture me like a photo, hustle
All I need is two cups of drank
With the system crank in the fifth of faint
See me pulling pranks in my candy paint
Pull broads around me in crowds
Vouge tires when I hit the breaks
My hustle skills you can't debate
Money don't wait, I'll be stacking up bank
Till I'm dead and up in them clouds
Getting to the cake, man, fuck your faith
Riding outta state with a Texas plate
Speakers in the back beating like an ape
4 15"s Rockford Fosgate
Crawl like a snake, boys gonna hate
But it's money to make, don't fall for the bait
Save the bullshit, I ain't gotta cape
All I got till I'm in the grave
Is a whole lot of hustle, hustle

[Hook: Yelawolf] (2X)
Pack it up and send it all away 9 to 5
I could do it all day, boy you know I gotta (hustle)
Broom and a mop, I clean 'em up from outer space
Gotta beam 'em up got an universal (hustle)
Had a premonition of me in the front seat of 2013
Boy, we gotta (hustle)
We gotta, we gotta (hustle)
You wanna go follow your dream then (hustle)

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Yeah, couldn't tell me not to believe in the people
That I was put in-front of and told that I had an opportunity
To become a part of a situation that put me in a position
To maybe some day break out of a small town, I guess
I fell for the okey-doke
I suppose, I couldn't turn around in the hokey-poke game
To see lames and other folks who thought a joke was being played on me
Oh well, the story goes again, here we go again
I'll again frown while the motherfuckers grin
I can hear the sound of the gate closing in
And I can feel the breeze of the hate blowing in
Cause they all wanna go sight-seeing
Hop in the Chevy and ride for a little while
Then they kinda wanna drive
Even make a turn, off a road you ain't familiar with
And offer to pay for the gas for a little bit, then
Before you know it, you got a best friend
But when he started off, he was just hitch-hiking
Should have heard real when they said "Wolf for real
If ya chill, then you'll find another one just like him"
But it's hard as a motherfucker to say No
When you're a rookie talking to a veteran playing pro
And everything that he's saying
He's saying to pay him close attention
So you put your hand low
Palms out, opened, hoping
And you can't even see that engine smokin'
Plus all the money that he gave, you owe him
Rear view mirrors all of them broken
Black boys, white boys, just a token
For the slot-machine, and the gambling notion
Scamming and scoping, the animal inside
The cannibal chose him, me
I fell for another man's hustle

[Hook]
