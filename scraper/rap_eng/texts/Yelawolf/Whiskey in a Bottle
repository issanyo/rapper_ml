[Verse 1]
Yeah
Still on that ass like handcuffs
Up in ya like hand-puppets
Make a mute holla
You should've jumped in that Impala homie
Refrigerators never seen ice baby
Not vanilla, not a breeze on the hill
Will make a flame grab a chinchilla
Quite like the words I built up to
Fuck guppies, I see food and I hush puppies
So give me that king crab
And I'll break its shell, you seen that?
Well fuck 'em if he don't take it well
So crack the top off that hot, shaking ale
And say "Free Young Struggle" who's not making bail
He got popped by the feds
Fuck the cops! Take an L
Fuck it take M-N-O-P, learn how to spell
I'll pull up to the gate and we'll skate on these country faggot's
And until then, fuck 'em, they can have it
Slumerican means: Slum American breed
Gutter raised with world-wide dreams, yeah

[Hook]
Put your hands to the sky
I'm a bullet in the barrel with a hairpin trigger now
Yeah, I'm a landslide
I'm a head case, trainwreck, avalanche comin' down
Put your hands to the sky
I'm a ready made party, I'm whiskey in a bottle now
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-laaa
I'm whiskey in a bottle now

[Verse 2]
Still on that gas like
The bottom of my signature shoe, 'Bama red
I'm on that ass like Alabama did LSU
Goose egg, oh lord
Bible Belt raised in your mouth like a cold sore
Roll Fords? Nah roll tide and roll Chevys
My momma rolls joints, smoke rolls off of the tip
Daddy's a rolling stone, I'm rolling in shit
With these pigs in the south side
Who you rolling with in the sticks?
With hair weaves and air streams
Cigarette stained walls
Fuck, I can barely breathe
Spittin' shotgun pellets
Out of my fuckin' chili bowl
But am I a hill billy? No
I am the truth behind these fuckin' illusionist
Yellin' redneck, you about as red as the color blue is
Call me a redneck, and I just tattoo it
Because of the abuse and I use it as therapy in music
So..

[Hook]
Put your hands to the sky
I'm a bullet in the barrel with a hairpin trigger now
Yeah, I'm a landslide
I'm a head case, trainwreck, avalanche comin' down
Put your hands to the sky
I'm a ready made party, I'm whiskey in a bottle now
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-laaa
I'm whiskey in a bottle now

[Verse 3]
Still on that grass like John Deere's
This yard is already cut, you can't get no work here
Uh, you fags thought it was swag
You was stealing, it turns out I got no peers
Just years of street smarts, so here you go retards
Come hit this bullseye, I’ll give you three darts
One: my last album flopped, two: it wasn't my time
Three: my fuckin' mama's selling my pajamas online
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-laaa
But guess what? (I'm whiskey in a bottle now)
Fuckin' right, I'm aged, I’m thirty-three
I'm not a child who plays with rap to get a piece, don't clap
For no MC who's wack, they get a free slap
Fuck out my car when I smashed in a Caprice, I’m Jack
Sippin' still, whippin' wood wheels
Truck on steroids, illegal to play ball
But dammit how good it feels, drop that black card
Park in the backyard, baby fire up the grill
It's party time

[Hook]
Put your hands to the sky
I'm a bullet in the barrel with a hairpin trigger now
Yeah, I'm a landslide
I'm a head case, trainwreck, avalanche comin' down
Put your hands to the sky
I'm a ready made party, I'm whiskey in a bottle now
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-laaa
I'm whiskey in a bottle now
