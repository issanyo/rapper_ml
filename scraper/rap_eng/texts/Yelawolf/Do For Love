[Verse 1]
Daddy is up five AM again, it's a repeated scene
He's been at since ten
Nine to five hours don`t pay enough money
He took a third-shift and he's just gettin' in
Babies are hungry and mommy is bitchin'
'Bout bills that he need to go pay while he sittin'
Not even five minutes to drink a cold beer before hearing about what was left in the kitchen
Walk out the door for a walk to the store, bread was five dollars he only had four
Won't get a check til' the first of next week and he said to himself I can't take anymore
With no heat in the house and no gas in the truck, and his four-year-old's birthday about to come up
It's gun, mask, duct-tape, gloves, now

[Hook]
What would you do for love? (ooooo)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooooo)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooooo)

[Verse 2]
She's a single mother livin' in a hotel in the south side of the city
And she works at a bar in the strip to get tips savin' up for a place that is pretty
A twelve-year-old son to support, still in school with a father that's never around
He took her virginity, promised infinity
Then he took off and he hasn't been found
Most of the people she already knows
Have trouble survivin' and keepin' a home
That side of town ain't the place to raise a child
But she's doing her best and there's no where to go
Puts on a skirt, picks up her purse
He knows just what she does
His mama can't work at the bar every night
So his mama is hustlin' and sellin' drugs

[Hook]
What would you do for love? (ooooo)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooooo)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooooo)

(Woohoo, woohoo)
(Woohoo, woohoo)

[Outro Hook]
What would you do for love? (ooooo)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooooo)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooooo)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooooo)
What would you do for love?
What would you do for love? (ooooo)
What would you do for love?
