Staaage Lights

[Chorus]
Stage lights
Stage lights
Ohhhhh ohohohh ohohohh
Stage lights
Stage lights
Ohhhhh ohohohh ohohohh

[Verse 1]
What's up world, hello showtime
Hello stage lights, goodbye small town
Hello small town, let's get up through
We came by to say somebody loves you
Somebody listen, we want more now
Somebody's dissin', but I'm not sure how
Told my briefcase, the secret is exposed
Open it up and watch arrangements explode

[Bridge]
Hey Ladies (Ohh yeah)
Ohhhhh ohohohh ohohohh

[Verse 1]
Time is ticking, but I'm not watching
I don't see age, I see options
I see oceans, people bouncing
From the hills top and over the mountains
Give us seas and we'll give you a forest
Give us trees and we'll build you a fortress
Fuck the money, we never got paid right
Money will come, but for now we do it all for the

[Chorus]
Stage lights
Stage lights (And it goes)
Ohhhhh ohohohh ohohohh
We do it all for the
Stage lights (Just for the)
Stage lights (And it goes)
Ohhhhh ohohohh ohohohh

[Verse 2]
Quit no face on the touring bus
I don't give up, if they know this us
All we wanna do is come and kill the venue
Let the world know what the crew has been through
Just for the fact that we feel the people
No magazine makes me unequal
No videos sets us apart from - none
The reason [?]
You ain't got the bread then just sneak in
Rush to the front and throw your hands
Cause it ain't about the money, we never got paid right
Money will come, but for now we do it all for the

[Chorus]
