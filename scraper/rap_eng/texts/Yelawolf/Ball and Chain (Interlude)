You made me
Everything that I am
You called me names till I became a name
Now that's all that I understand
Now the joke's on you cause the whole damn world's at the palm of the fool's hand
Now the fool's got the jewels
And the joker's in the smoker with his palm on the hot pan
Cause I'm that boy with the ball and chain
Floating through the sky, looking down from a jet plane
Looking down from a jet plane, oh
Yeah, I'm that boy with the ball and chain
The boy with the ball and chain
Now I'm looking down from a jet plane
