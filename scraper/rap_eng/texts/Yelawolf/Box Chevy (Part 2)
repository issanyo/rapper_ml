[Intro]
Hello Chevy
Chevy? There you go
Really? Well, listen to you
You wanna go for a ride?
Well let's go then

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Once upon a time in a land of 'Bama
I met a little girl with a bent antenna
I was on the skateboard cruisin' by when I
Seen her in the yard with a sale sign in her
Didn't have a dollar to take her to dinner
All I really wanted was a chance to get her
Went to my piggy bank shoebox
Then skated right back and put my bid up
Look I know you want 3 for her, but I got 25 hundred in cash
Please nobody better deserves to sit up on a box Chevy like that
Not a stall, not a pause, not a chirp when I turned the key, man, everything worked
And I think I gotta new girlfriend
Black on black white wall dessert

[Hook]
My box Chevy that's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box Chevy
That's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
Hello little baby, you're lookin' like a 10 with that there wax on
Funny how I never thought about another love like uhh
Cadillac on chrome
Or another way to ride home
At night I'm crazy, but little buddy you're such a lady
Gotta put rose pedals on your dashboard
You never let me down, when we go to town
And you gotta beautiful sound
Out the back of the pipes you breathe
Rum t-t-tum tum yessiree
You never wanna get there in a hurry
You can run a corner with no swerving
I pull up and hop out of her lap quick
With the AC blowin' out them snow flurries
Cold in the woods, storms in the winter
I just let her run under the hood, let her get warm and then I enter
Can I re-introduce my buddy, try not to let her get ugly
But if I gotta hit a ditch and dip this bitch I'll leave a piggy muddy
It's my box Chevy

[Hook]
My box Chevy that's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box Chevy
That's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
This is is my box, this ain't no Maybach
Ballers say "Why Yeler?", Yeler says "Why not?"
Do it for time watch
My whip is timeless my address says classic
Address my box as your highness
Roll around the city with my girl
Come on everybody and meet my love
I know it wanna make you hurl
So I keep a brown paper bag in the glove
Spewing this, your new Buicks
You're new to rich, we're winning weds
My bitch is better, whatever, baby
They hate greatness greatly my lady
They can't persuede me to put in suede seats
Take off my hubcaps, that just ain't me
Here we go again you and I ride, off into the sun of an Alabama sky
Rum t-t tum tum, say bye bye!

[Hook]
My box Chevy that's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my Box Chevy
That's my girlfriend
She's always ready, always ready to run
Box Chevy, that's my baby
Body so clean
I'm leanin' back in my box
