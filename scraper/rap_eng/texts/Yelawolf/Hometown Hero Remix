(VERSE 1- BIG K.R.I.T)
A superhero in the flesh
Even at my worst, I'm the best
For the finish, I stretch
When they advance me this check
Coulda bought my way to heaven but I blow it on my neck
Instead, what you expect when you ain't have shit
And they ain't paying half of what you asking
Couldn't even see the pussy even if it's Cassie
Lot of hoes are down for taking pictures cause you're flashy
You can't even imagine, maybe Kim Kardashian
Number one song and a Grammy, now I'm smashing
Maserati crashing, swerving through the traffic
Wrap it 'round a pole, sell a mil off the tragedy
I defy gravity
Flyer than I half to be
Talking to the Lord "I can't stay, who gon' save hip hop after me?"
It's like a torn ACL to an athlete
Boobie Miles, Friday Lights, capture me
In my hometown

(HOOK)
Can't seat it, can't seat it ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping fam (memories are fresh)
Can't seat it, can't seat it ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping fam (ooh, the people I've met)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of my world)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of my world)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of this world)
Can't seat it, M-Town, Hometown Hero (are the wonders and now)

(VERSE 2- YELAWOLF)
Alabama homie, I wear it like a hat
Im a small town boy, Im so proud of that
Some people leave it, they ball til they fall flat
I just wanna bring it home, and give it all back
Cause givin all that, whats been givin too me
A successful rapper, uh, i might as well hit the lottery
So instead of becoming a diamond-wearing novelty
I rock beads and buy my mama some property
Tell the white boys in the pick up truck that Yelawolf is comin home
For the Chevrolet dunkriders in the projects and the trailer park zones
You might've seen my face in a couple pages in the XXL
But if I can't walk around in my own neighborhood, then leave that shit on the shelf
Took the keys to the old Chevelle, cause if I'm in a boat by myself
Then everything I catch will go bad, see all I wanna do is share
Give it away, give it away, everybody come take what you can hold now
Gadsden, I love you, lemme introduce the world to my hometown

(HOOK)
Can't seat it, can't seat it ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping fam (memories are fresh)
Can't seat it, can't seat it ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping fam (ooh, the people I've met)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of my world)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of my world)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of this world)
Can't seat it, M-Town, Hometown Hero (are the wonders and now)

(VERSE 3- BIG K.R.I.T)
It's just Ciroc in the cooler
Not a day off, but I'm still Ferris Bueller
Winners never lose, so how dare you confuse us
They quote what I spit like Confucius
He say, she say, rumors all day
The rap game is high school, and life's a hallway
Like what clique you in
The Beamer or the Benz
The Bentley or the Lambo
Like here we go again
Don't sit at my table
VIP, I got this
If you ain't popping champagne after every game then don't pop shit
Homecoming queen with my picture in her locket
But I know what's up with her hands in my pockets
They love me cause my swag is so jock-ish
Freshman year, saw her ring like I'm boxing
You voted most likely to never ever top this
I'm Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman
In my hometown

(HOOK)
Can't seat it, can't seat it ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping fam (memories are fresh)
Can't seat it, can't seat it ('round my hometown)
Third coast representer, Mississippi sipping fam (ooh, the people I've met)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of my world)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of my world)
300, 300, my stomping ground (are the wonders of this world)
Can't seat it, M-Town, Hometown Hero
