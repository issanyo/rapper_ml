Everyday is like an episode of
"Hillbilly In Beverly Hills"
Dr. Pepper soda
Fizzle in my dixie cup
Jumpin' out the dixie truck
Bumpin' just don't give a fuck
Something I don't give a fuck about
Is giving a fuck
Still whipping a Bud
Cap off 'n' sippin' it up
Bama I'm lifting it up
You know cool enough to be you daddy
Young enough to be your homie
Real enough to get you elbows, macaroni
Give me the stacks and I'm on it
Look holler at you homie
Got a couple of bedies
Who's ready to put the mattress on me
Gettin' naked from Becky
Givin' bonies to Joany
If I make Joany mouny
Then she'll fry me bologna
I'm not the king, but I got the crown like a royal bag
And I'm movin' up to the surface
Just like a porpoise, back
Blow ho, sneeze, Yela so cold (please)
That my refrigerator quit
And gave me the groceries
That's why I eat so good
Bananas and mayonaise and white bread
Huh, so good
And that's so hood
Cali couldn't screen me
Visionaries in a coma couldn't dream ‘n’ still
I became it, on this campuses painted
My ownership I retained it
I'm on the ship that ain't sanking
I'm on a trip to be famous
My hand on my dick, sanging
With hand over fist, banging
I handle it, I maintain it
Am I changing the game?
I think it's a pride to say that I ain't
Aiming it?  I claim it
Might as well learn my name it's Yelawolf
DJBooth.net, so you can prove it
32 ton rock, don't try to move it
Catfish Billy, boom boom
Malay, Ghet-O-Vision
Holler at you folk
