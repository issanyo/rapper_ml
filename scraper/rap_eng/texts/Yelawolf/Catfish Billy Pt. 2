[Verse 1]
I've been that boy since I was struck with that pill
Thinking Alabama when the wall bend
Never knock it up, yeah sucker pills
Call it up bowties on the grill
Momma said no [?]
[?]
And I learned from watching the neighbors
Watching the neighbors
Got me a toy that's cheap
Feeling real hot [?]

[Hook x2]
Catfish Billy
The motherfucking Billy in the house
Billy and I'm really in the house
Billy like I'm really on the top of love
Dope boy I ain't never seen dry
Boy I ain't never seen a drop
You ain't never seen a Catfish Billy
There'll never be another fucking song
Never be a motherfucking stop
Checking from the bend I'm in now
If you thinking Alabama
That ain't never been another just bounce

[Verse 2]
Still left the bottle bending like gorillas
Shaking my drum like a killa
You ain't fucking with Slumerican stop
Bitch wrote a sink of a pillar
Gonna sentence a sitting ass
I ain't got time I ain't taking trash
Out to the bend to get round with my pen
Like I'll take another bottle and pour the glass
How do I build a fortune
And I didn't remember that key to force it
Killing all forces to sinner a porch and not move
And still being of it
Imagine alien, homo sapien, we young rappers
Like been to walk a ton water a mile
And fuck off all the time
Drinking up this fire and don't need to cork it
Gorgeous, gimme those
I'ma make real, momma make a pity most
And if you wasn't with me when the shit hit the fan
Then you cannot get a picture
You ain't been up to date with me bro
Gotta pay the taxes, 'fore the wood is out
And the kerosene can is filled up to the brim
So don't look at him, go get the matches
Mess up of the taken hype
I make a chick that has switched the light
[?]
Cause I

Catfish Billy
The motherfucking Billy in the house
Billy and I'm really in the house
Billy like I'm really on the top of love
Dope boy I ain't never seen dry
Boy I ain't never seen a drop
You ain't never seen a Catfish Billy
There'll never be another fucking song
Never be a motherfucking stop
Checking from the bend I'm in now
If you thinking Alabama
That ain't never been another just bounce
