[Intro]
Hey SupaHot Beats, hey Jim Jonsin
I need y'all to drop me some of that country ass shit
I need somethin' that'll make Sheryl Crow go, "Goddamn, that shit's raw right there"

[Hook]
I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud

[Verse 1]
You know the sun shines real bright in the mornin' time
Through the window of my trailer in the pines
I need a little somethin' to shade that light
A beer buzz starts my day off right
Granny's in the kitchen, cookin' and singin'
Zoup get me up, look at what he brings in
Hey, ain't that a 12 pack, buddy?
"Yessir, you know I ride dirty"
I ain't even got a shower yet
But I devour a 12 oz. in three seconds
And it's an alchie's weddin'
I married the Bud and now I'm in Heaven
Sheryl Crow is the queen
I really I wish I had her here to drink with me
But it's just me and Dixie
And I'm one down, [?] hit me!

[Hook]
I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud

[Verse 2]
Well, the roosters crowin'
My boxers saggin' and my ass is showin'
Walkin' through the yard to get my mail
I'm feelin' good if I say so myself
Wave to the neighbor, sittin' on his porch
He hates my guts, yeah of course
His daughter hangs out with us on the weekends
But I throw the peace sign, cheers my friend
I ain't got no problems here
I drink beer, my head is clear
My eyes are foggy, I don't feel groggy
Will I drink more by 12? Prob'ly
But now I'm chilled out though
Tuesday mornin' nowhere to go
Fire up the grill and call some bros
We four-wheel drivin' off the road

[Hook]
I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud
I like a good beer buzz early in the mornin'
And Billy likes to peel the labels from his bottles of Bud

[Verse 3]
Chillin' on a monday
Drinkin' my brew day
For another beer I'll gladly
Pay you on Tuesday
Come on, let's ride around
Get high n' ride around
Six pack, twelve pack
We can all drink 'em down
Drink 'em down, drink 'em down
Drink 'em down, drink 'em down
Six pack, twelve pack
We can all drink 'em down
Drink 'em down, drink 'em down
Drink 'em down, drink 'em down
Six pack, twelve pack
We can all drink 'em down

We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
We are drinking beer at noon on Tuesday
And Billy likes to peel the labels
