[Hook]
Goin' back to 'Bama, gonna take it nice and slow
Goin' back to 'Bama, wanna see some old dirt roads
Take it easy Alabama and I watch my babies grow

Goin' back(5x)
Alabama(3x)

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Yeah I'm comin' home to my chevrolet and I'm a ride alone
I'm coming round, to this old bridge and this small town
And I'm a cross this river bed, and bring every body I know
And I'm a show them the best side of this rebel flag that people hold
My cousin told me don't forget where you come from
Baby boy I won't I promise, how could I run from
What become so strong, a part of my childhood, where nothing could cheer me up like the thought of home and the wild woods

Goin' Back(3x)

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I hold up the name, cause we been through it all
I'm not afraid of change when Daddy said he knew it all
I just shook his hand well maybe you're wrong, cause I found the whole world when I found my song in Alabama

Goin' Back(3x)
Alabama(2x)

Yes sir, yes sir I'm going to back bama with a fifth of that jack
Shotgun rested on the gun rack give me 20 bucks and a six shot and I come back with a moonpie and a 6 pack
Catfish billy got a piece of that pie, ha tell me do you want some of that? And I pull up with a whole flatbed
The baddest that you ever got from a crop, Yelawolf's got that cold flow from a old road, put a motherfucker down
In dixie wit' a verse that I pulled out from the soul, wanna come inside? Well really I got that lock n' load
2,5,6 in the booth I spit, got a crew I'm with, from the roots of the old in Alabama

[Outro:]

Take my hand Dixie land, if you wanna rise, then I will stand
Hold my hand Dixie land I know your proud, I understaaaaaaand

[Hook:]

Goin' back to bama, gonna take it nice and slow
Goin' back to bama, wanna see some open roads
Take it easy Alabama and I watch my babies grow
