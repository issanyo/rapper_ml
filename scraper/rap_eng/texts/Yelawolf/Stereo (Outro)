[Skit: Yelawolf, Sheriff, and Chainsaw Perry]
*Sirens*
This is the Sheriff's department (Uh oh)
You are completely surrounded
Well, that's about all the time we have today, people
By a fairly force of Airwolf's finest
Chainsaw, you good? *muffled screams*
If you do not untie Chainsaw Perry (Chainsaw!), and remove the duct tape from his mouth (Haha, yeah, my dawg)
Well, we had such a great time sabotaging your favorite radio station, we might just do it again! Stereo, ah, Peter, Buster, let's go Ideal! (I will unleash an enormous brigade of whoopass! You have ruined the face of good music! In return, I will ruin your life!)
*Knocking* The only rock you will roll will be tied to your ankle! I will hip and hop on your ass with golf shoes on! Do you hear me Yela boy! Yela boy!
