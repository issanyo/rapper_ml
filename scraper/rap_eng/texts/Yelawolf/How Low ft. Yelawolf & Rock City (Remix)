[Intro: Chuck D. sample] (x4)
How low, can you go? How low, can you go?

[Sped up] (x4)
How low, can you go? How low, can you go?

[Ludacris]
Ha ha!
I'm in the zone right now baby
Luda! listen...

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
Ludacris got a remix, finna go low
Hold up, let me get my camera
I wanna see Arizona, Indiana
Minnesota, and the women in Louisiana
D.C., VA, Motor City to the Lou', what it do?
Finna blow like Waco Chi-town goin' way low
Both Cakalakas, Alabama to the M-I-Yayo
New York, California
Philly and they really put it on me when I'm down in Texas
Album numero siete get ready for the battle of the sexes, I'm restless
Tryna tell 'em that I'm hotter than the burn in the 3rd de- gree, gree
Then I try to tell 'em ain't nobody in the world as hot as- me! me!
If you really goin' low, you gotta go- hard
Go lower than the grades on yo' reports- card
God! Ludacris, I'm the best that ever did it- did it
And when it comes to the money I'm like, "don't stop, get it! get it!"
Whooo!!

[Interlude: Sped-up Chuck D. sample] (x4)
How low, can you go? How low, can you go?

[Hook: Shawnna & (Ludacris)]
I can go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know (x3)

[Verse 2: Yelawolf]
I got a pocket full of posies, a big ?
And a pocket full of stogies
I run a beat like a police
And I make a white girl chicks get rosey
So work a pole like street promo
We pay cineveo, we big show
Bring it down on the ground if you really down
Tell me now (How low can you go)
Yea, low like an 808 drop
Lower than the chrome on a 88' box
Low like I'm in the seat when I see cops
Lower than a cinnamon in a ?
Spread it out like a peacock
She's hot let me watch like D shock
I heard they call it that sweet spot
Well I'm hip-hop, baby want a beat box (Uh-ah-uh-ah)
Breath, that's a good way to start
A ain't a motherfuck around like me
That'll spend 10 G's inside a wallmart
I wouldn't give a bitch 50 cent
But I'll give a bitch 50's art
Have a baby by me baby, live in a trailer park
How low, can you go?

[Interlude: Sped-up Chuck D. sample] (x4)
How low, can you go? How low, can you go?

[Hook: Shawnna & (Ludacris)]
I can go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know (x3)

[Verse 3: Rock City]
Lower than a limbo ?
Lower than a bottomless pit




[Hook: Shawnna & (Ludacris)]
I can go low (go low), lower than you know
Go low (go low), lower than you know (x3)
