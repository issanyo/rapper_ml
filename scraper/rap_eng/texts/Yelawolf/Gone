[Intro]
Yeller... Wolf, Catfish Billy
It goes...

[Hook]
Well I went out with a buddy or two and it was o-o-o-o-o-on
And we got to the bar 'bout a quarter to 2
When it was o-o-o-o-o-on
And we got gone (yeah yeah yeah)
And we got gone (yeah yeah yeah)
And we got go-o-o-o-o-on
And we got gone (yeah yeah yeah)
And we got gone (yeah yeah yeah)
And we got go-o-o-o-o-on

[Verse 1]
Ho! Ho!
Haha, no, not you my lady, I’m illegally parked I know
Pardon my French and my Mercedes
But I have no excuse for this flea market shirt I’m wearin’
My Motley Crew is beastly and we enjoy the starin’
I’m unemployed and darin'
How dare I be so cool when it's so hot in Alabama
Sometimes we get snow too
And I’m as rare as a white Christmas in Miami, really
The temperatures droppin’ don’t stop, bitch
The ocean's getting’ chilly

[Bridge]
But I’m drivin’ (I’m drivin’, I’m drivin’)
My people (My people)
To party (To party)
Party (Yeah)
Some drinkin’ (Some  drinkin’)
Get rowdy (Get rowdy)
P-P-P-P-P-Party

[Hook]
Well I went out with a buddy or two and it was o-o-o-o-o-on

And we got go-o-o-o-o-on

[Verse 2]
Ho! Ho!
Yes, I jumped off the boat
And I’m sinkin’ in my chair 'cause my beer bottle does not float
Help me now (Now)
Please enjoy the show
I done come up so fast that I’m afraid of heights, I gotta go
Help me down
Or I’ll just learn to balance
Somewhere between commercial dreams and music that is valid (Yeah)
My babies need to eat so I create a simple sound
The Fiasco threw me for a Lup-é, I dumbed it down, Slick
Ricky Bobby

[Bridge]
And I’m drivin’ (I’m drivin’)
My people (My people)
To party (To party)
Party (Yeah)

And we got go-o-o-o-o-on

[Verse 3]
Yeah, my people are ridin’ in trucks and wheels oversized
In such a world I reside, and you’ll let one go if your pride
And enough to give you a bottle, been throwin’ troubles around
I got them car keys in hand, I know what the fuck's goin’ down
Some of these people come sick, so pop their trunk for a gaze
They wanna do bodily harm, they wanna live for the day
We just came to get stupid, so gimmie that bottle of Crown
I take my girl to my Caprice and get the fuck outta town
C’mon girl

[Bridge]
And I’m drivin’ (I’m drivin’)
My people (My people)
To party (To party)
Party (Yeah)
