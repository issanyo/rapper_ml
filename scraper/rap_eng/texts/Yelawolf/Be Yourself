[Intro: Yelawolf]
I just wanna hang with real people
You know, I don't give a fuck about how much money you got
Who you know, none of that
Be authentic, that's the type of people I want to kick it with

[Verse 1: Yelawolf]
Motherfucker I'm, a catalyst of the baddest that you can find
Cowboy hat, sittin' crooked in the corner of the club when I'm sippin, my
Jack, beautiful woman on my side
Fact, you ain't gotta tell me, I know, I'm fucking getting it
Fake motherfuckers just talk, I'm fucking living it
Chevy in the parking lot
But I’ve had a few holmes, I'ma have to Uber home
I'ma have to pull my phone out, hit the icon, baby
Then I’m moving on, but I won’t do it alone, uh
Take a walk with a wolf, girl
I can make a good girl a hood girl
We can get down and party, shaking the Chevy
But whatever happens in the truck, if you could, girl

[Chorus: Yelawolf]
Please just be yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you’re like no one else
Nobody wanna hang around somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you’re like no one else
Nobody wanna hang around somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself

[Verse 2: Bubba Sparxxx]
I love it, I love it
I'm buzzing enough just to fucking (go nuts)
Fuck discussion, ain't discussing nothing, I'm just gon' (roll, up)
Show up, show out, big dog, watch how that money go (fold up)
Didn't know then, but we know now, them clowns we ain't never (told us)
So what? You know what?
That stuff there is what had made me (grow up)
Think I can't? Bitch, think we ain't, think what you think you (ho, slut)
Let that tongue besides both nuts
Then swallow this whole pole up
While me and Single Wolf pour up
Show love

[Hook: Yelawolf]
Be Yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you’re like no one else
Nobody wanna hang around somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you’re like no one else
Nobody wanna hang around somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself

[Verse 3: Yelawolf]
Step up in this motherfucker with a black hoodie cuz I'm icy cool, yeah
Spillin' so much ink on the paper I could have filled up Drake’s pool, yeah
They told me to get ready but I've been ready, fucking Betty's way back in school, yeah
An animal, Hannibal, cannibal couldn't manage to get a handle, I'm too sick
Butters off, leather seats creeping up the alley in the Caddi like "Who's this?"
Catfish, hold up
When you see me coming, homie, throw the deuces
Got a couple  killers in a camp, wanna dance motherfuckers is ruthless
Back in the, back of the Chevy holding something heavy, g-g-g-get it, let's go!

[Hook: Yelawolf]
Be Yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you’re like no one else
Nobody wanna hang around somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself
Be somebody, make somebody say you’re like no one else
Nobody wanna hang around somebody that is boring
I'd rather be by myself and drink on the Porch Swing
So hold your breath if you can't be yourself
