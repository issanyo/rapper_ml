[Verse 1]
My girl might leave me if she hears about this
LA confidential, LA confidential
I hope she never has to hear about this
LA confidential, oh

[Hook]
Cause you know I got somebody
So I can't fuck with just anybody
But sometimes I get lonely, I get lonely
So let me keep it real with you, real with you
Can't keep it real with me, real with me
When I get lonely, I get lonely

[Bridge]
Now and again, and again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again, and again

[Verse 2]
And I hope you don't expect to be my girlfriend
LA confidential, LA confidential
Cause I think you know I'd never leave my girlfriend
LA confidential, alright

[Hook]
Cause you know I got somebody
So I can't fuck with just anybody
But sometimes I get lonely, I get lonely
So let me keep it real with you, real with you
Can't keep it real with me, real with me
When I get lonely, I get lonely

[Verse 3]
I know we fuck around but I can not get with you baby
I be on my own shit, moving acting different baby
I be in the city baby, the city baby
So when I'm with my hoes I ask that you don't act like you've been fucking with me baby
LAX, LA sex I get at you for
I run time, it's your nigga come get at the boy
I got a girl but I'm still trying to fuck
Long as you know that what's up
I hope you know that's what's up

[Hook]
I got somebody
So I can't fuck with just anybody
But sometimes I get lonely, I get lonely
So let me keep it real with you, real with you
Can't keep it real with me, real with me
When I get lonely, I get lonely

[Bridge]
Now and again, and again, and again, and again, and again
And again, and again, and again, and again
