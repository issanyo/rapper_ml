[Intro]
Oh yeah, I mean I'm glad y'all tuned in
It's been a great tape
I mean but I couldn't do it without leavin', Swavey
Extraordinary nigga, baby
I only do extraordinary things

[Verse 1]
Look, I be skippin' class, fast women with ass
Last niggas to smash was the team bigger than that
I don't see niggas though, figured it be rap 'cause
We fast livin' ballers and the bad bitches spoil us
I am takin' shots, celebratin' me guap makin'
Pussy niggas pissy mad at the way that God made it
Live, familiar to y'all, I made it to the top
Hatin' ass niggas, had to go get you past niggas
So I ball, she in like my drawers
When I was only a fetus, I keep it on only the G'est
These dames see us, freeze us like the gang mistreated
Women good gushy, only hit it when I need it
I got the game on the lot like it's house arrest
Got your dame on my jock, gave her mouth a rest
Playin' beer pong, money and my hair long
Therefore dog, I'm pluggin' hoes 'til I'm gone
Me and Sunny D, lovin' the freaks and fuckin' for free
That's why them real niggas fuck with me
Plus the hoes love us, on the mission to get this dough from us
They tryna poke a hole and so, I bring my own rubbers
But no love for hoes with no number
Oh, I'm so fucked up, been livin' in the moment
These hoes don't want you when you lease, they want you when you own it
Yes, Canadian best, I don't you know it homie, motherfucker

[Chorus]
Bollin' in my two door, cut the beat up
Layin' back without the seat up, no come drive with my feet
Niggas lie, it's why these niggas surprised
They ain't never met a nigga this G
Bollin' in my two door, cut the beat up
Layin' back without the seat up, no come drive with my feet
Niggas lie, it's why these niggas surprised
They ain't never met a nigga this G

[Outro]
Hand me my tail comb Cindy
This is an extraordinary nigga named Slim Juice
I keeps it pimpin', playa
And I ain't into the name talkin'
But all that swave blockin' gon' get you fucked up
Now Tory Lanez is a playa
And he ain't got no time to be jivin' with you anti-swavin' ass
Bumb ass niggas
Every time we do, it's gon' be swavey
And you ain't never, ever, ever, ever, ever gon' witness
Another Canadian nigga genre like this here brother
Tory motherfuckin' Lanez, Swavey
