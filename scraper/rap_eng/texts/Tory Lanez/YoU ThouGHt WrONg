Just in case
You thought that I wouldn't get down
I got so many of them on the rebound
You thought that I wouldn't get down
I got too many, too many, ah
Just in case
You thought that I wouldn't get down
Gotta keep it real with you I thought you were down
You thought that I wouldn't get down (You were down)
You thought that I wouldn't get down (Super down)
You thought that I wouldn't get down (You were down)
You thought that I wouldn't get down

[Verse 1]
2K on my Saint Laurent (Saint Laurent)
Spent a few K on my latest charm (Latest charm)
Did you see what I put on my baby arm? (Ahh)
These rocks so big, it look like it's from Flintstones (Yeah)
And my bitch bad (Yeah)
Gave you all my love (Love)
And you sent it back (Yeah)
Now I got a new thang who don't be on mood swings
Who be on that new thang, got at least two thangs on her

[Chorus]
Just in case
You thought that I wouldn't get down
I got so many of them on the rebound
You thought that I wouldn't get down

Gotta keep it real with you I thought you were down
You thought that I wouldn't get down (You were down)
You thought that I wouldn't get down (Super down)
You thought that I wouldn't get down (You were down)
You thought that I wouldn't get down

And I'm popping when I got it in the door
Smoking presidential, got it in the smoke, ohh yeah
Baby, we got big shit to do

Count money 'til your wrist switch to blue
It's a cash money game, baby, fast money game
And I still got my ex-girl calling (Ah)
I'm just out hereâ€‹ balling (Ah)
Took my brand new ting out to Miami just to spoil her (Yeah)
Switch it up, flip it up, rip it up, takin' my bitch out the to the garden
'Til when you see me balling with the shawty, know it's

But, it's all good, though
'Cause, you know what I'ma do?
No, real shit, you know what I'ma do?
