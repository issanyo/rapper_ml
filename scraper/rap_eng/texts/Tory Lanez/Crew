[Verse 1]
I know summer time, down south, girls wear white tee's
All my New York, up-state girls in the Nikes
But all my T.O. girls, you know I got you
And they lyin' if they ever say I'm not the truth
I only want to make you mine
And take it slow and take my time
So this one here is just for you
You slidin' by later shawty, me and my crew

[Chorus]
Pull up on them girls and we swinging on fo', uh
Pull up on them girls and we swinging on fo', uh
Tell me where you at shawty, tell me what you know, uh
Pull up on them girls and we swinging on fo', uh

[Verse 2]
This for my Houston girl, my New York Girl
And T.O. girl, my Creole girl
My hold the phone and press record
That TiVo girl and she so thorough
And don't think a nigga forgot
About my B. More girls
That rock them weaves and see them curls
Say fuck a hater, she don't care
So this one represents my heart
Even though I had you from the start
So this one here is just for you
I'm slidin' by later shawty, me and my crew

[Chorus]
Pull up on them girls and we swinging on fo', uh
Pull up on them girls and we swinging on fo', uh
Tell me where you at shawty, tell me what you know, uh
Pull up on them girls and we swinging on fo', uh

[Outro]
