[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I used to serve by my grandma's house (yeah)
I left some birds by my grandma's house (hah, brrt)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out (no)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out (no)
I used to serve by my grandma's house (yeah)
I left some birds by my grandma's house (brrt)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out (no)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out

[Verse 1: Zona Man]
Whippin' with a towel because the handle hot (the handle hot)
Take it out the pot and hit the land with rocks (the land with rocks)
Used to stash the work up in my grandma's couch (my grandma's couch)
Uncle steady haulin', quick, run in and out (in and out)
We don't count the profit 'til we runnin' out (we walkin' out)
If it ain't 'bout no dollars, quit runnin' your mouth (runnin' your mouth)
'Cause we come from the streets, it's very hard to fake it (hard to fake it)
Treat that brick just like a bitch because I get 'em naked (hah)
In my money room, I get my chat on (my chat on)
Ain't a trap phone, that's a trap, homes (trap phone)
Your bitch been on my mind and she's one call away (one call away)
But that money on my mind so she gon' have to wait (yeah)
My uncle need a hit, my auntie need a fix (need a fix)
I got back on my feet, I came from sellin' nicks
Police hit my spot, that was my mama's house (my mama's house)
Then I started stashin' the dope right at my grandmas' house

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I used to serve by my grandma's house (yeah)
I left some birds by my grandma's house (hah, brrt)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out (no)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out (no)
I used to serve by my grandma's house (yeah)
I left some birds by my grandma's house (brrt)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out (no)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Serve by my grandma with no conscience (yeah)
Ayy, I'm a prince, I'm with the function (yeah, rich, homes)
To keep it real, I just want money (racks)
I'll poke your eyes out like a pumpkin
My grandpa had a gold toilet when I was a kid (yeah, yeah)
Jumped off the porch and I landed in a Benz
My diamonds marchin', my jewel won't let 'em win
I robbed his ass for his junkies and [?]
Brrt, that's that mob talk, big dawg
Brrt, I drink Act, not the Cristal
Brrt, yeah, brrt, bird call
Yeah, yeah, let the chicken walk (slatt)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I used to serve by my grandma's house (yeah)
I left some birds by my grandma's house (brrt, brrt)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out
I used to serve by my grandma's house (yeah)
I left some birds by my grandma's house (brrt)
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out
You knockin' at the door, but no, I can't come out
