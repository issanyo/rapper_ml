[Verse]
I said "who am I?"
"Baby, what are you and I?"
We used to be suicide do and die
Never knew it that a newer guy, you would find
I figured I was on to the next one
But my heart, it was hard to forget one
Regretted every scar I had left, uh
I feel em when I pause, and the stress come
I was really in love with this girl, like
But keep it on some real shit
You was somebody that a brother could really deal with
The only woman I could chill with, and really chill with
Instead of tryna hit it real quick, real spit
Feel it
I guess I couldn't see it comin'
It's like a bill from the cab when the meter runnin'
I'm still feelin like I'm needin your lovin
Up in this race, girl you're keepin me runnin
But, fuck it, uh
I guess the lovin is gone
Go with him but he ain't never gonna love you as strong
You, you, could never tell me that the lovin was wrong
Cuz we both know that it took us to above and beyond
I, I, I'm still thinkin that you must be the one
Look how you got me fucked up, look at what we become
But I ain't trippin cuz I knew that you done done what you done
And every relationship gotta be done when it's done, and I know

[Bridge]
Sometimes I think, what if I was wrong?
Would I be sittin here, writing out this song?
I know that sometimes I may have been wrong
But you gotta forgive me, yeah yeah
And I know that we both done made some mistakes
When I face it

[Hook]
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
Now that you're gone, ay
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
Do, do, do you, hey girl
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you
Do, do, do, do, do
Don't leave me hangin, babe
Girl I need you

[Outro]
All I need is you, ohhhh
Babee
