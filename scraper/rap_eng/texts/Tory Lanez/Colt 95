[Verse 1]
Does he fuck you right?
He don't make you feel like I used too
He can't do your body the way that I do
I never thought
Your new nigga, he ain't me and now you'll see
I made you, look how a nigga made you

[Chorus]
I made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doin' 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can ride with your body, babe
I'm doin' 95 on your body, babe
I made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doin' 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can ride with your body, babe
I'm doin' 95 on your body, babe

[Verse 2]
He don't know your body
The way that I know it goes down
You don't feel how
How you felt, when we go, when we go down
And though it's no more now
I think it's fucked up how

[Chorus]
I made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doin' 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can ride with your body, babe
I'm doin' 95 on your body, babe
I made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doin' 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can ride with your body, babe
I'm doin' 95 on your body, babe

[Verse 3]
Uh, heard you goin' back to that college
I acknowledge the fact that I'm back
Blowin' this pack of this loud, for all this factual shit
Shit, I know that you gon' hear but fuck it, I'm gone in my spare light
Lines for my lamp page and time for these moments
When I ain't got time for 'em, I be tryna get my shine
So even though we was fuckin', it was nothin' but time, I'm lyin'
Gettin' mine is hard, but shit I'm tryin', I'm fine
She don't need me and time is helpin' her leave me
So I don't want nothin' from her, fuck, shit is crazy
We came from sayin' that we would be makin' babies
To blatantly sayin' daily how much that you fuckin' hate me
And I ain't got no time for them bitches though
Ain't no nigga hit your mind like I did it though
You and your nigga, y'all don't grind like we did it though
I fuck your body and your mind, 95 on this woman, yell stop

[Chorus]
I made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doin' 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can ride with your body babe
I'm doin' 95 on your body, babe
I made you never wanna fuck with nobody else
Doin' 95 on your body, babe
Ain't no one can ride with your body babe
I'm doin' 95 on your body, babe
