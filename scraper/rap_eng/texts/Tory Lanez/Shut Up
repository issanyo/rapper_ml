[Intro]
Stupid ass lil bitch
Let me introduce you to this motherfucker, bitch

[Verse 1]
Okay, I scorched out that mirror
Bake shakin' my mirror
Diamonds talkin', HD
Can't speak, I'm not clear
Bitch, I ain't no fair
Wild buck 'cause you stare
2 seater McLauren
Hit the broad and I clear
Any niggas try put one on son
Shoot that nigga like one on one
I be in the B nigga, come on, come
Bakes knockin' like ba dum dum
Lookin' in my watch, see 10 in it
Everythin' I got, got a bean in it
Benzes, Benjamins
At Benihannas, I been spendin'
I fly the nigga, I'm finna stunt
Whip elephant, trunk in the front
I hit it once and then I jump
To the next hoe, I'm finna fuck
I drop her off, don't pick her up
Got a white girl, she thin as fuck
But she rich enough to get a Bentley truck
So I'm in her jump like when I cut

[Chorus]
When I'm in a thot, don't you hoes tell me nothin'
When I'm in the spot, don't you hoes tell me nothin'
Pull up in a drop, can a hoe tell me nothin'
Pulled it off the lot and I drove like it's nothin'
Say nothin', like what, what, hey what, shut up
What, say what, say what, shut up
What, say what, say what, shut up
Say what, say what, say what, shut up

[Verse 2]
I came here like uh
Fucked your bitch on accident
She smoke the dope like uh
She sittin' back, I'm cappin' it, I'm 'bout it
Nigga, got a lil swave brain right there, nigga
It's a lil too much swave
Okay, the realest nigga, your orcha
Smoked the dope in my hard top
Bitches all on my dick
Find a job and get a part time
Why you hatin' on me for?
Why the fuck you want our time?
With money spend, they callin' me
Like everybody on your line
Had a rich lil extra one
She got cake and that paper on
She ain't here but that money round
I dick her down and I take it from her
Swave shark, no khakis
Tonight I might fuck that bitch
And I ain't fuck for like 2 weeks
So I used your girl for my practise
I say how'd I do that? How'd I do that?
Fly your bitch out, tell her boo that
Parlez vous francais, shawty party out in Paris
And rendez-vous back
Baby, you naughty, I'm nice
Sippin' that lotty on ice, blue top Bugatti I drive
Sippin' hypnotic while tippin' that body
And whippin' Bugatti all at the same time
That's swave nigga, swave nigga
Killin' that pussy, I grave dig her
Look at my seats, that's swave, nigga
Motherfuck your DJ, nigga
He ain't got no T Lanez, nigga
He ain't got no Kanye, nigga
Fuck you talkin' nigga, slow your talkin'
Wanna close your mouth and just say nigga, let's go

[Chorus]
When I'm in a thot, don't you hoes tell me nothin'
When I'm in the spot, don't you hoes tell me nothin'
Pull up in a drop, can a hoe tell me nothin'
Pulled it off the lot and I drove like it's nothin'
Say nothin', like what, what, hey what, shut up
What, say what, say what, shut up
What, say what, say what, shut up
Say what, say what, say what, shut up
