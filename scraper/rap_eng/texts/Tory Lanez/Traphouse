[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Shawty, you know that a nigga won't lie
Came into my house, I had to bust it like a whole pie
I know she the bomb, she hit bong like a smoka
She pass me that white, I say, "I don't do no coca"
Fuck up out my trap house, my trap house, that's no lie
Kick you out my trap house, my trap house, that's no lie
Hop inside that foreign whip on Ocean, hit the whole drive
I would say you ballin' but I see you in that O-5
I pull couple bands from that stash, she get more fire
Hard to see these other niggas in here, they in Lo-Fi
Shawty, I'm the man, I'm the man and I won't lie
Don't come to my crib if you ain't fuckin'
Shawty, that's that shit I don't like
Open up my IG, bitches tellin' more lies
See them out in real life, niggas don't get no guap
Pop a couple bands though, uno, dos and four knots
Fuck up off of my dick, no bitch, yo bitch on my whole jock

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez & Nyce]
All my guys, I just came with
Bunch of girls on me, it look like I just came in

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Y'all know that I'm the hottest nigga out my city
I stunt, don't front, don't give a fuck 'bout what your bitch say
You see us on and yeah, we poppin' bitch, we been paid
And you know I ain't showin' up unless I'm gettin' paid
Bitch, get the fuck out of my motherfuckin' trap house
It's some reasons why I had to kick your ass out
