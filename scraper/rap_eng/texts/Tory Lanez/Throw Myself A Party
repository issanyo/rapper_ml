Sip, sip, sip, sip, yeah
Grab my bottle, take a big sip

Sip, sip, sip, sip, yeah

[Hook: Starrah]
I just wanna get drunk and throw myself a party
I've been juuging for some months, time to throw myself a party
Roll my green up with some blunts and throw myself a party
Bad bitches turning up, time to throw myself a party
I've been working hard, now it's time to go in
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party
Young and living large, baby, yeah you know it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party

[Verse 1: Starrah]
12 months straight, no sleep
Sipping lean, still no sleep
Party hard till the sun creep
Making money niggas don't sleep
Turn your bitch into a super freak
Said she only had one drink
Blow her line up, she gon' let the phone ring-ring-ring
Calling all her friends, they wan' get it in
Tell 'em it's about to get lit, yeah they know it's about to get lit
20 bitches on the hit list
I want all her friends, down to get it in
Yeah they know it's 'bout to get lit
Yeah they know it's 'bout to get lit
Grab my bottle, take a big sip
Sip, sip, sip, sip, yeah
Grab my bottle, take a big sip

[Hook: Starrah]
I just wanna get drunk and throw myself a party
I've been juuging for some months, time to throw myself a party
Roll my green up with some blunts and throw myself a party
Bad bitches turning up, time to throw myself a party
I've been working hard, now it's time to go in
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party
Young and living large, baby, yeah you know it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Another party, 'nother Ferrari
I stretch the truth like pilates
See all of my hoes exotic
None of your hoes invited
When I meet her in the lobby
If she ain't fucking then I leave her in the lobby
I fuck the bitch if she pigeon toed
Using my belt for a mistle toe
I used to bet on the telephone
I done made love in a vehicle
This right here, this is your anthem
Throw a party in the mansion
Throw a party in a trap house
Drink something then pass out
2 Chainz, tru

[Hook: Starrah]
I just wanna get drunk and throw myself a party
I've been juuging for some months, time to throw myself a party
Roll my green up with some blunts and throw myself a party
Bad bitches turning up, time to throw myself a party
I've been working hard, now it's time to go in
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party
Young and living large, baby, yeah you know it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
So tell me am I wrong?
Cause I think every girl in here just wanna fuck me
Off Patron, spilling what I'm sipping on these Balmain jeans
Maybe we should have a party
Like where the fuck my bitches tonight?
And where the fuck my liquor tonight?
Tell the waitress we ain't tip unless she get it right
So get that liquor, come here shawty

[Hook: Starrah & Tory Lanez]
I just wanna get drunk
And throw myself a party
I've been juuging for some months, time to throw myself a party
Roll my green up with some blunts and throw myself a party
Bad bitches turning up, time to throw myself a party
I've been working hard, now it's time to go in
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party
Young and living large, baby, yeah you know it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's time to throw myself a party

[Outro: Francis and the Lights]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
