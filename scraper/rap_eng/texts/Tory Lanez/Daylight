[Verse: Tory Lanez]
It's been so long since I have had Patron all night
I feel so good until daylight finds us
Let’s be honest, now and again
'Til daylight finds us
Let's be honest, now and again
’Til daylight finds us
And we'll be up baby, until the daylight breaks
And we'll be up, until the day starts to wake

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Let's take this time
Don't you let no one take us away
And tonight
We'll be home till the daylight wakes
So don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don’t let daylight find us
Don’t let daylight find us (oh oh oh)
Don't let daylight find us (woah, oh oh)
Don’t let daylight find us

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
And let's speed on, until the daylight breaks
Lets speed on, until the night sky turns grey

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Let's take this time
Don't you let no one take us away
And tonight
We’ll be home 'til the daylight wakes
So don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us (oh oh oh)
Don't let daylight find us (woah, oh oh)
Don't let daylight find us

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
So don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us
Don't let daylight find us (oh oh oh)
