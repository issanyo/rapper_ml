[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Puttin' Purple In The Soda
Twist This Marijuana
Do You Wanna Fo'sho, Fo'sho
Whippin' In This Rover
Telling You Come Over
I Got Questions For Ya
That Go, That Go
Do You Wanna Fuck?
Will You Roll Up On Me, Yeah
Do You Want Some?
Cuz I'm Down
Now Are You Down For It?

[Verse 1]
Tell Me Bout Places You Wanna Go
Its Maybe Some Places You Never Been
Can I Bring Marijuana & 2 Of My Friends
Maybe To South Of France
Maybe A Country That's On The Map
Maybe A Country You Can't Pronounce
And They Playing Some Music
You Never Heard
For Some Reason
They Still Make Your Body Bounce
Imagine That Place
Was Surrounded By Beautiful People
And People Was Treated Equal
No One Would Talk About Race
Or The Color Of Skin
And Judging Would be Illegal
Me & You In The Parking Lot
Smoking Blunt After Blunt
And You Giving Me Details
Bout The Way That You Fuck
And The Way That You Kiss
And The Way That You Touched
I Know That You Went Through Some Things
But Regardless Of That I'm The One To Trust
I'm The one That'll Kiss You & Give You Love
When You Feel Like You Down And You Givin' Up
When You Feel Like Nobody Else Give A Fuck
When You Feel Like Friendship Is Not Enough
I'm A Be There To Stare In Your Eyes
And Tell You My Love You're So Confident
I'm a Tell You How Long
I Been Waitin' For Someone Like You
All These Hoes Be Gossipin'
Do You Like To Smoke?
Do You Like To Fuck?
Can You Roll This Weed?
And Make Me Perfect Blunts?

[Hook: Tory Lanez]

[Verse 2]
We Haven't Talked In A While
We Haven't Fucked In A While
I Been Fuckin' With Someone Else
But I Know That You Care
And You Hold Me Down
I Appreciete All Of The Pictures You Sent Me
When I Was Stressing Up In Jail
When I Was Feelin' By Myself
You Knew Exactly What I Felt
Baby I Thought About Us
Layin' In Bed With Some Blunts
Layin' In Bed With Some Cups
Kissin' With Passionate Love
With Expensive Lenin's & Italian Rugs
Thank God You Were Part Of My Destiny
Got A Lot Of Haters
Got Some Enemies
Got Some Thirsty Bitches
Tryin' To Get With Me
2 At A Time Trying TO Live With Me
Got A Reputation Of A Savage
Model Bitches Not The Average
Used To Roll Around Doing Damage
Don't Know How I Did But I Manage
She Was A Good Girl Now My Personal Stripper
I'm Not On The Grind Then I'm Kickin' It With her
Summer She Act Like She Single
Then We Start Fuckin' In The Winter
Do You Like To Smoke? (smoke)
Do You Like To Fuck? (fuck)
Can You Roll This Weed (weed)
And Make Me Perfect Blunts? (blunts)
Are You Down To Get Away (way)
Maybe Fall In Love (love)
I Love That Pretty Face (face)
She Made Me Fall In Love (love)
