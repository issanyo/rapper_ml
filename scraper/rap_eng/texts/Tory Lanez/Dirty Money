Part I

[Verse 1]
Money on my mind
All the time, all the time, oh
Slangin', sellin', niggas tellin'
Catchin' feelings, on the low
Friends switchin', different women
With you every night, woah
Prayin', sinnin', sinnin', prayin'
That the Lord, take my soul
Money on my mind
All the time, all the time, oh
Slangin', sellin', niggas tellin'
Catchin' feelings, on the low
Friends switchin', different women
With you every night, woah
Prayin', sinnin', sinnin', prayin'
That the Lord, take my soul
