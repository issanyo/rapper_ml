[Instrumental: Falcons]

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Listen what you told me, listen what you told me
Look at how I'm on it, look at how I’m on it

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Listen when I play this, this is not a playlist
We've been on the same shit, I ain’t tryin' to change shit
Got girls that be tryin' to get famous, but they remain nameless
Saw you got me on a wait list, damn right, I'm awaitin' this

Music to my ears
Eh-yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo) (Right)
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss
And it all goes through our ears

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss and we touch
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss and we touch
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss and we touch
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss and we touch
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss and we touch
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss
And it all goes through our ears, through our ears, through our ears
Music to my
