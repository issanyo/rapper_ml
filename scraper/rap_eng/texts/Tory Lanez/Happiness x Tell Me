Part 1: Happiness

[Chorus]
Hard times, had to grind too
I see happiness when I find you
I see happiness when I find you
Now you're here in the clouds, looking for the sky too
Hard times, had to grind too
I find happiness when I find you
I find happiness when I find
Hard times, I

[Bridge 1]
Can you stay? Will you tell me 'bout it?
Tell me all about it
Bae, tell me 'bout it
Tell me 'bout it

[Interlude]
It, it was clear as day, I remember like, oh, remember I was at school. And I just, uh, just waitin' for my ride, you know. It never came, so I end up walkin' home. Remember it was just pourin' rain the whole time I was walkin', you know. Somethin' 'bout the sentiment in the air, I just felt it was a bad day, you know. So I get to the house, you know. All of a sudden, I see my sister, she just, she just crying, just bawlin', in tears, you know. She just runs past me, so I asked her, "Yo, what's wrong?" She just slammed the door, she don't say nothin', you know. So, so my father then, you know, he call me in the kitchen. He sit, he sit me down on the counter and he tell me, uh, "You know, I took your mother into the hospital," you know. He tried talkin' in a stern voice, "I took your mother to the hospital this morning and uh, by this afternoon, the doctor had pronounced her dead," you know. So we sat there, we uh, you know, we cried in the kitchen and outside I watch him tell all my other siblings the news, you know. And I seen this, this, this grey cloud just kinda, just kinda hover over us for a lil bit, you know. So when I'm, when I'm thinkin' 'bout my mother, Luella Peterson, you know, I, I call it, uh, true happiness

[Bridge 2]
All about it
Tell me all about it
All about
I see happiness when I found
Hard times, made us strong

[Chorus]
Hard times, had to grind too
I see happiness when I find you
I see happiness when I find you
Now you're here in the clouds, looking for the sky too
Hard times, had to grind too
I find happiness when I find you
I find happiness when I find
Hard times, I

[Bridge 3]
Hear you say, will you tell me 'bout it?
Tell me all about it
Will you tell me 'bout it?
Tell me 'bout it

Just tell me how you hate the way I made my last decisions
Tell me how you hate the way I make these brash decisions
Tell me how I'm never home to sweep or do the dishes
Tell me that I never made the time to do the dinners

Tell me that you hate the way I hop up out that Wraith
And act like I'm the shit
