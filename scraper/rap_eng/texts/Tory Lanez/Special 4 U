[Verse 1: Z]
Oh, baby do you want me?
Just let me make it worth it
Give you first class service
'Cause you deserve it
Yeah, you deserve it

[Pre-Chorus: Z]
I know when I take you home
You gon' make me put it down
Hope you're ready for the show
'Cause I'ma do tricks and I'ma show them things
So say "Yeah" if you ready for it
Are you ready?

[Chorus: Z]
I do, really want to, do somethin' special for you
Do somethin' special for, somethin' special for (That's right, baby)
I do, really want to, do somethin' special for you
Do somethin' special for, somethin' special for (That's right, baby)

[Verse 2: Z]
Gon' break your back like you stole somethin'
Gon' bring it back like you stole somethin'  (That's right, baby)
I'ma check it out like you owe somethin'
Check, check, check it out  (That's right, baby)
[??], takes some skills to please me
I can be your brand new hobby
With all of this body
A-All of this body (Oww)

[Pre-Chorus: Z]
I know when I take you home
You gon' make me put it down
Hope you're ready for the show
'Cause I'ma do tricks and I'ma show them things
So say "Yeah" if you ready for it
Are you ready?

[Chorus: Z]
I do, really want to, do somethin' special for you
Do somethin' special for, somethin' special for (That's right, baby)
I do, really want to, do somethin' special for you
Do somethin' special for, somethin' special for (That's right, baby)

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Nobody do it like you do
Hella bad when you cruise through
I'm in the club spending all hunnids (all hunnids)
But you a boss and you do too
Boss (boss), she sauced (she sauced)
Can't get her pretty ass off of me (Off of me)
Upgrade me, I'm cocky (I'm cocky)
Pull up with it, they like how much did it cost me
Red bottom (red bottom), Chanel bag (Chanel bag)
She ain't looking, at a sale tag (no no)
I'm the only one with that fresh up outta jail swag
Find dough with it like the mailman
I know you want me
A little bit of you on me
She got somethin' special for me
Well, shawty we gon' see (Yeah yeah)

[Chorus: Z]
I do, really want to, do somethin' special for you
Do somethin' special for, somethin' special for (That's right, baby)
I do, really want to, do somethin' special for you
Do somethin' special for, somethin' special for (That's right, baby)

[Outro: Z]
That's right, baby
That's right, baby
That's right, baby
