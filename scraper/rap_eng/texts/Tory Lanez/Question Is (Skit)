You say that you love me
But you still out in these streets
All that hustling, hustling, hustling
Leads to nothing, nothing, nothing
It’s time for you to leave
Cause you're still out in these streets
All that hustling, hustling, hustling
Leads to nothing, nothing, nothing
(hustling, hustling, hustling)

Tory’s Girlfriend: Hey Tory, its me. I just wanna let you know that I’m walking away from the situation. I just feel like I have tried and I tried, its just... I can’t get through to you and ... I feel like you love this lifestyle more than you love me. Just pray that you take care of yourself and be safe out there. I love you

Tory: At this point, I ain’t know what to do, couldn’t go back to my girl’s house and I for damn sure wasn’t going back to the hood. I had less than a dollar and a dream and I was flooding down Loners Blvd
