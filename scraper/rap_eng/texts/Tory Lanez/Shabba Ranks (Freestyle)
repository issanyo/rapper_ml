[Intro]
I'm back!
Canada!
And if you broke when you wake up, you ain't got no business sleepin', nigga

[Verse]
Short cup but my clip tall
With a point like a pitchfork
Only dark nigga coming’ in this shit hard
Like your man got a thang for your bitch door
Every nigga round ready for the quick draw
Bullets open like a split door
Hundred women lookin' for me with a flashlight
All they niggas lookin' for me with the jigsaw
Wait, hold up, I told ya I blamma like Tony Montana
I roll with the hammer like popo and slammas
I'm fuckin' yo sister, manolo my manners
My niggas is thuggin, they don't go on camera
I fuck with that polo, don’t wear assassin
I come with that 44, you know I be matchin'
Y’all over there with the yelling’ tone down on umbrella
We coming you know that the section
Shorty no questions she know that she have it
Kick there ass out cuz i know that she like it
Then she came back and she gave me a stack
Put my brain in my lap how I know you a psychic
Shout out them bitches that hating’ on Jay cuz my
Nigga he paid and i know that you spiteful
Feel like my life is a picture on Insta cuz women they see me I Know they gone like me
Send them that Hannah Montana
Then I get 10 of my men in Atlanta
Then I spend 10 on that fendi and 10 on my belt
Just to shine on 10 when i slam her

Fiber artist really I don’t like these artist
Every motherfuckin’ line that you write is garbage
Every motherfuckin’ time that i might just start your eye department
Cuts you nigga teeny to me hit a nigga with a bottle
Thats a genie to me easy for me to get a little piece of the B-I-E
Fuck niggas wanna D-I-E with that dot on your top
Like E-Y-E I had to smell it to tell you niggers
Jealous hundred women with me they twista up like impalas
Niggas hatin’ on me my pockets on mozzarella hoping'

Fucked in the truck with the windows up

Make me all the dough in this bitch, I just hit my nigga
