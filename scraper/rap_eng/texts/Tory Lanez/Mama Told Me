[Chorus]
My mama always told me I would have the hits
She wasn't alive to see me have a hit
Had to make decisions, go and hit the road
That was back when Keisha nearly had a kid

[Verse 1]
Nigga, had to sell about a quarter ounce
Sold pop of front of somethin' like a whole ounce
He said, "Why you never get to see me at the crib?"
Step mama moved in, nigga, so I bounced
Real shit, if I had to sell a quarter water
Only thing I gotta do I get rent pay
Told the teachers, nigga, I'ma be a fuckin' rebel
Dropped out next week, that was 10th grade
Yeah, rich young nigga, I came up
Told you niggas I would get my change up
Put 7 8 9 10 chains up
Fuck the 'gram, this show me where I came from
Yeah, know we in the place
Hit the Ricky Bobby with the .40 on my waist
Gold grill shinin' like a Rollie in my face
I just hit a point like I'm Kobe with the play
Talkin' to the kid, dawg, niggas pissed off
But we came here after the plays lift off
Nigga, you are now talkin' to the kid, foo'
Lot of niggas talk the shit but they ain't really with the shit
For a rich nigga, rich nigga
All my niggas stars, when you see us
You are lookin' at a big dipper
Oh boy, oh God, let a nigga win, we gon' buy the whole store
One Umbrella, yeah
I told you niggas, I told you niggas

[Chorus]
My mama always told me I would have the hits
She wasn't alive to see me have a hit
Had to make decisions, go and hit the road
Young black nigga stickin' to the code

[Verse 2]
Had a court case I done tossed that
Couple ex bitches I divorced that
I remember when I could not afford that
Couldn't even sign for it, had to forge that
Yeah, money on my mind, got the ambition and the grind
Hang a fuck nigga like he dryin'
One twelfth rhyme
'Bout to order steak with the fries
Used to eat the Maruchan chicken with the side, one time
Every nigga workin' in the trap
Pray to Lord, help you if you servin' with the strap
Wait, J., you know I deserve me a plaque
If it ain't comin' to me, nigga, I murder a track
I'm a rich young nigga from the 416
Same bitches hatin', they be on my dick
Every year boy, we real heavy over here, boy
I waited for my time, now the shit is finally here, boy

[Interlude]
Finally here, boy
My niggas finally here, boy
All the shit up in a year, boy
Standin' right here boy
It's clear boy
When I step up in the airport, hold up, yeah
Wall to wall money, I done did it
Nigga, I'm the truth and I admit it
Contracts gettin' written, I'm the nigga
Air Jordan, my nation, Scottie Pippen
Killas on the payroll
They'll shoot it if I say so
2014, I ain't really for the beef
I just want the fuckin' peso
Yeah, and the cheese with the queso
100 Gs in the case, Lord
We was just some lil niggas last year
Playin' with them lil things off safe mode
Young nigga, had to get the money and the funds quicker
I don't wanna have niggas sleepin' on my shit
After a nigga dropped this one

[Verse 3]
Im talking his and hers beamers for me and my side bitches
Calvin Klein pictures in all my design scriptures
Made alot of money just spitting what’s flying richer
So nggas try and lay low just hope that they lie in ditches
Im killing these nggas
George Forman in the 6 how I'm grilling these niggas
Yall like to play games and say names never to me directly
Just someone connected next to me, yall ain't got the heart so you try and talk on the reg to me
Niggas steady claim that they got it
Tried to use my name in some product til I found out
Shit is crazy I made it, from the bottom and told the Dot that i got em
Some niggas just ain’t believe me, but shit they couldn’t see it like Stevie
With the keys, but he still played them
And Jesus ain’t start with believers, but he still made em
I had to make some change, I made my dollars then I made my name
I’m never letting this fame let me change
I’m courtside a couple Lakers games
I’m always in some block a hater frames
Or some, gold and you see wanna rob a players chains
These niggas is like Destiny’s Child tryna say my name
Its worth it, I lay your hearse with purpose
These niggas put me on the hook cause they scared of my verses
And I can kill your best written while spitting my worst shit
Young rich and gifted nigga my writtens in cursive, listen
Yall taking bout them high tone women glowing skin tint purses
Already got my iPhone 6 with the Sprint Service
At sixteen in a limosines with the tint service
2015 its hard not commit murder
When i pull up, hop out, bringing the backwood up
Niggas hated last year now they saying what up
You was not around when i was selling the cook up
Or roaming downtown without a home to hook up
Grandma basically told me to find a corner
Little did I know I’d be selling that marijauna
Little did I know it would turn into that Madonna
Little did I know I’d be selling right on Spadina
Little did I know I would roll into local diners, to try and find me a sandwich or something
Cause this hunger from my heart is moving down to my stomach
Shit I’m scarred, trying to find myself on this fucking boulevard
It’s Fargo
