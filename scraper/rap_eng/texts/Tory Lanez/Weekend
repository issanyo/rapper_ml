[Intro]
Dawg I used to fuck her on the weekend
And I swear that pussy smell like peaches
Instagram the photo with no filter
Or SnapChat me that pussy with no features

[Chorus]
She let me fuck her on the weekday
And told me not to tell nobody
Left the party with her three friends
We smokin' since I hit the lobby
All these bitches want is trues
And some music they can do 'em too
We on this fuckin' tour bus
Made it this far, now what are you gon' do, for me?

[Verse]
What happened to this?
'Cause we got it in
And we get it in on the side of the city
And you gotta feel me
I'm smellin' like hundreds and 20s and 50s
Inside of the buildin'
She got on money, it's time to come get it
Come ask for these digits
All this time that I spent on you
Now you gon' tell me [?]
All this time that I spent on you
Girl you know you have to give me some
All this money that I spent on you
Just for you to tell me that it's wrong
For all the time that I spent on you
Girl you know I had to write this song

[Chorus]
She let me fuck her on the weekend
And told me not to tell nobody
Left the party with her three friends
We smokin' since I hit the lobby
All these bitches want is trues
And some music they can do 'em too
We on this fuckin' tour bus
Made it this far, now what are you gon' do, for me?
