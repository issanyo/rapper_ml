[Intro: Gina Lee & Tory Lanez]
Feel it in my knees, feel it in
Shawty wanna let it go
I know you down for that girl, we been here before

[Verse 1: Gina Lee]
Feel it in my knees, dunno what it is
I be gettin' weak when you come around
My daddy catch attack if he only knew
That I down for you baby, didn't know what to do
Never understood how attraction work
Or why we gravitate to the same god
Superman with the kryptonite
Pray it don't come back to bite

[Pre-Hook: Gina Lee]
I guess, I guess that's how it works
Wonder what might hurt
It's a mystery
That I can't figure you out

[Hook: Gina Lee]

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Shawty wanna let it go
I know you down for that girl, we been here before
I know you did some things with some other niggas
I know you did some things you won't tell a nigga
And I'm still fuckin' with ya, money on another comma
Fuckin' too much money, need a money counter
Got some bad bitches in here tryna leave with me
And a nigga never fuckin' doubt 'em, gotta leave a fuckin' album
I be on, I be on this shit for real
And I see it comin' when she walkin' in them heels
And I take 'em off cause this shit I need to feel
Shawty when you see a nigga pop that pussy like a real, oh yeah

[Hook: Gina Lee]
Bad boy, you's a bad boy
I love the bad boys, why I love the bad boys?

[Verse 3: Gina Lee]
Livin' on the edge and it's all me
One day at a time, that's what I preach
No no no way tryna settle down
Let's have a good time for the meantime
Yeah, you look so good
So good that I'm really wantin' a bite
They said you no good, no good, I shouldn't think twice
Let's have a good time for the meantime

[Pre-Hook: Gina Lee]
I guess, I guess that's how it works
Wonder what might hurt
It's a mystery
Get that work, baby
Let's have a good time for the meantime
Let's have a good time for the meantime
Let's have a good time for the meantime
Cause I know you ain't tryna settle down
Let's have a good time for the meantime

[Hook: Gina Lee]
Cause you a bad boy
Bad boy, you's a bad boy
I love the bad boys, why I love the bad boys?
You's a bad boy
Bad boy, you's a bad boy
I love the bad boys, why I love the bad boys?
You's a bad boy
