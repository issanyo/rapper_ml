[Hook]
Out of all the damn girls in the world, I done ended up with you
I'm talkin' all the bad bitches in the world, and I ended up with you
Now I ain't still dwellin' on them girls, but I know that it's true
I could have been far along with someone else than you

[Verse 1]
Uh, and I wish there was a drug for this
But it don't seem to be no sort of medication
Even though we signed up for this
Oh I know there's gotta be a better way
We supposed to be
Lovin' but we fightin' over shit we shouldn't be
And I got a lot of girls that I could see
But you don't see...

[Hook]
Out of all the damn girls in the world, I done ended up with you

Yeah, though I know you're wrong for the shit you did
I don't want you to get this wrong, you know you can always get this... wait
