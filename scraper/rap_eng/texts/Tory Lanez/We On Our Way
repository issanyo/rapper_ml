[Intro:]
We on our way
I'm on my way
Savage Squad, bitch, we on our way
Talk to 'em T Lanez

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Hopped up out the 'Rari now they say I'm on my way
If she don't leave with me I'mma send her on her way
My whip so (?), ya'll niggas so scared, I know they all afraid
If she don't leave with me I'mma send her on her way
I'm on my way
Young niggas don't play, I'm on my way
And my bitch on the way
Young nigga don't play, young nigga don't play
I swear I'm on my way, I'm on my way, young nigga don't play
I swear I'm on my way, young nigga don't play, I swear

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Never signed a deal, independent, had to make a way
Call my plug, say he got that yay, need that shit today
Got chips like Frito lay, bitches do what Fredo say
Text their phone and they text me back like I'm on my way
I'm on my way, talking money? Let's conversate
Chasing bitches? I'm chasing cake
Front on me, that K gone spray, that K gone spray
Chopper beat like 808
Front you work and you don't pay
Kill your ass the next day
Tell these fuck niggas catch up cause I'm on my way
Call a club up, tell 'em Squad bitch we on our way
Bitches comin' every way, poppin' 'Zans like everyday
Niggas fake, bitches fake, but I know that anyway

[Hook: Tory Lanez]

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Bitches come and go, see me I ain't chasin' them
Kush blunts got a nigga high like I'm lacin' them
Savage Squad don't play with them
Keep guns, we play with them
Let us see a opp, then you know that we sprayin' them
We sprayin' them, chopper bullets aimed at him
Fuck them niggas that came with them
Bad bitch with a 5th of lean
And she have some friends and she said they on their way
And she have some friends and she say they on their way
In a room full of bad bitches up in their draws
They ain't finna do the squad, pass 'em just like basketball
Downtown (?), we finna fuck 'em all
Remember when I ain't had shit and now a nigga got it all

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
