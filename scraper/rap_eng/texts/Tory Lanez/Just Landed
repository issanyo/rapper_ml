[Intro: Tory Lanez, Stacey & Calvin]
Ah, this is your captain speaking. Thank you for flying with Flock Fresco air crafts, where we flock freshly. If you are not flocking, you are dying. We will be landing shortly so keep your seat belts on and stay seated. Don't forget to put those lighters in the air and keep your speakers bumping. Enjoy your stay, over and out

Mr. Lanez, your craft will be landing in approximately 5 minutes
Thank you, baby
Oh yeah and Stacey, do you know where Calvin is with my Yeah, last door on the left
Thank you, baby. You're a doll
Hey Mr. Lanez
Yessir
Go get 'em

[Verse: Tory Lanez]
Uh, la-la-la-landin' out a rocket ship
Pick my head from out the glass, breathin' check for oxygen
I don't know where I'm at, compass check, where's the map?
Fuck the world and if you don't love a nigga, wear a hat
Landed on this atmosphere, all I hear is snare and clap
Took everythin' that I feared, rerecord, hear it back
Told me that my mother died, me, I wasn't clear to that
I look in the mirror, my reflection doesn't mirror back
Grandma say I'm hella dance, father say intelligent
Aunt Suzan let me be free, been my nigga ever since
Brock always supported me, Moses thought me morals he Showed me what to do, now I make music, so accordingly
Yeah, I swear everythin' happens for a reason
Day to day begins and every day creates a season
I take off my space gear, pull myself from placement
Open up the slidin' doors and hop up out the spaceship

[Chorus: Carlisha]
When the lights are blinding
And everything that surrounds your being
And tonight's your landing
In the new world, and planned this
And you're just landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
And you're landing, you're landing, you're landing
And you're landing, you're landing, you're landing (Yeah)
When the lights are blinding
And everything that surrounds your being
And tonight's your landing
In the new world, planned this
And you're just landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
You're landing, you're landing, you're landing
