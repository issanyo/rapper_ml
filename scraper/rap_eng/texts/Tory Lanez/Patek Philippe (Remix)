[Intro]
That's what I thought you said, now let me offer this as a rebuttal

[Pre-Chorus: Ice Baby]
Flexing on the plug, on the plug, on the plug
Flexing on the plug, on the plug, on the plug
Flexing on the plug, on the plug, on the plug
Flexing on the plug

[Chorus: Ice Baby]
Ok my watch Patek, my food Philippe
Your girl a freak, I fuck her in the sheets
I fuck her in the sheets, I fuck her in sheets
I fuck her in the sheets, I fuck her in the sheets, ooh

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Tory, I fucked a bad bitch out of Starlet's
I told her I'ma hit it, hit my target
Landed in New York City in a starship '
Cause I be still scammin' on the low (yo Tory)
Juggin' and finessing on the plug
I hate it when bitches wanna stress it in the club
Fuckin' up the high, all up on my next side
You bout to shake my hand, don't do it wit' your left side (nah)
That's right, she fresh up out of Bedstuy
Diamonds VVS and we don't do the SI (yo Tory)
Hopped out the coupe, drop top, I'm in the loop
It's do-do-do-do-do, bitch we ain't callin' out a truce now

[Refrain: Ice Baby]
And I been making moves on the low
Stacking this bread, one hundred grand on the low
I be scamming on the low
Finessing all the plugs on the low
I be scamming on the low
I’m the reason why these niggas scamming on the low
Forty grand every time, for a show I think you should know

[Pre-Chorus: Ice Baby]
Flexing on the plug, on the plug, on the plug
Flexing on the plug, on the plug, on the plug
Flexing on the plug, on the plug, on the plug
Flexing on the plug

[Chorus: Ice Baby]
Ok my watch Patek, my food Philippe
Your girl a freak, I fuck her in the sheets
I fuck her in the sheets, I fuck her in sheets
I fuck her in the sheets, I fuck her in the sheets, ooh

[Verse 2: Ice Baby]
You a lame, don’t try it
I let it bang, I ain’t lying
Oh you lit? that’s your bitch?
In my car, sucking dick
That’s your wife? that’s my side bitch
Give me brain, like a psychic
Who Buggy? that’s my sidekick

[Refrain: Ice Baby]
And I been making moves on the low
Stacking this bread, one hundred grand on the low
I be scamming on the low
Finessing all the plugs on the low
I be scamming on the low
I’m the reason why these niggas scamming on the low
Forty grand every time, for a show I think you should know

[Verse 3: Ice Baby]
Why you mad bitch? why you sad bitch?
Cause you mad broke, and I'm mad rich
And I’m silly man, I'm the bigger man
Stay with the four four like I’m Jigga man
Jigga what? Jigga who?
Love my white girls, and my jiggaboos
Diamonds on my neck, call it Pikachu
Let me get at you, let me peek at you
And we staying with the Glock
Just in case we ever see an opp
Hit his head, let his body rock
Hit his head, let his body rock
I’m rocking Helmut Lang, I’m in my lane
Talk about me, I’ma call the gang
Helmut Lang, I’m in my lane
Talk about me nigga, I’ma call the gang, Gwalla
For my girlfriends, this is for my girlfriends
And my thuggers, and my thuggers
And my thuggers


[Refrain: Ice Baby]
And I been making moves on the low
Stacking this bread, one hundred grand on the low
I be scamming on the low
Finessing all the plugs on the low
I be scamming on the low
I’m the reason why these niggas scamming on the low
Forty grand every time, for a show I think you should know

[Outro: Buggy]
Gwalla Gang for life
