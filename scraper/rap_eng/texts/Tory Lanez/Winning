[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Yeah
Stopped wearing my chains
Too much clink clink on the mic
Fargo, yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Ridin' round in this foreign but I got it on me
Shawty with me got a tan straight from Miami
Bubble gum in this double cup with your sipper
No excuse for that shit, just bitch I'm winning
Yeah bitch I'm winning
Our niggas they down as fuck, 'cause we winning
All these bitches stay down to fuck 'cause I'm winning
Yeah bitch I'm winning

[Verse 1: Kream Tech]
They see us getting it, ask for forgiveness, my nigga we on it
I started with nothing and turned into something, I'm just being honest (for real)
I'm stacking this paper, might give you a loan, I ain't talkin' about college (splash)
I came with the water, my shit like a faucet, my diamonds are flawless
My bitches are gorgeous
I need the Beam and the Benz and the Royces
I was a young nigga jumping off porches
Nigga we winning just check what the score is
These bitches be choosy but I'm with the choices
How you the plug dawg? (how?), nigga I'm cordless
You cuffin' these bitches, falling for thots, man that pussy is poison
I just fucked your bitch in the traphouse
I wear Balmains to the courthouse
Swear we started off in the basement
Now I'm presidential in the penthouse

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Ridin' round in this foreign but I got it on me
Shawty with me got a tan straight from Miami
Bubble gum in this double cup with your sipper
No excuse for that shit, just bitch I'm winning
Yeah bitch I'm winning
Our niggas they down as fuck, 'cause we winning
All these bitches stay down to fuck 'cause I'm winning
Yeah bitch I'm winning

[Verse 2: Kream Tech]
I roll up, I pour up, when I wake up no Folgers
Got a bad bitch right next to me and she walk around with her nose up
'Cause she know, she with that nigga
Newbie be on it, her shit a little bigger
If you run up then she pulling that trigger
The Glock in the Birkin, my nigga she with it
We just both copped tans on South Beach
24k my mouthpiece
Know I'm pullin' up in the foreign
If you riding in the borin' nigga get the fuck from 'round me
Like hold up (hold up), syrup and soda
Smokin' OG cause you know I'm a stoner
Niggas is funny, I'm king, you a joker
Counting these chips, I don't even play poker
Call up my nigga T, came through with the thots
We don't never call you 'cause you work for the cops
('Cause I'm winning), yeah, so you niggas been lost
Born cold-blooded, man this shit is not a problem (splash)
Fuckin' with success, no failure ain't an option
Designer head to toe, niggas know what I'm rocking
Run through the check, man you niggas still walkin'
Splash

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Ridin' round in this foreign but I got it on me
Shawty with me got a tan straight from Miami
Bubble gum in this double cup with your sipper
No excuse for that shit, just bitch I'm winning
Yeah bitch I'm winning
Our niggas they down as fuck, 'cause we winning
All these bitches stay down to fuck 'cause I'm winning
Yeah bitch I'm winning
