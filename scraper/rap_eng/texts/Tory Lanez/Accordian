[Verse 1]
Walk in, lay down, you stay right here
It's my night to do you right
I want us to stay here forever
Give you studio loving tonight, tonight, oh
If we don't stop this music we'll be dancing babe
And through them tights you wear, I see your lingerie
So shawty, press the playback
Now come here and lay back, I'm about to blow you away

[Chorus]
Come lay here for me
Lay you out like an accordion
Let me press your keys
You can feel me touch 'em
Up and down
Up and down, down
Up and down
Up and down
Up and down
Up, up, up, up, down
Up, up, down
Up, up, up, down

[Verse 2]
Played it right
Stay the night, say you like me too
Likes to rub, likes to touch
Like it rough, me too
I'm gon' tell you, why we should be
You know I got just what you need

[Chorus]
Come lay here for me
Lay you out like an accordion
Let me press your keys
You can feel me touch 'em
Up and down
Up and down, down
Up and down
Up and down
Up and down
Up, up, up, up, down
Up, up, down
Up, up, up, down

[Bridge]
Baby girl, I can play you louder, louder
Hit them keys, that's gon' make you wilder, wilder
Baby girl, I can play you louder, louder
Hit them keys, that's gon' make you wilder, wilder
Go ahead, wild out
I hit it 'til it fall out
Show me what you all 'bout
And we gon' do it all out

[Chorus]
Down
Up and down
Up and down, down
Up and down
Up and down
Up and down
Up, up, up, up, down
Up, up, down
Up, up, up, down
