[Pre-Chorus]
Just hit a fifth of the bottle
And I'm in for it, I'm in for it
You brought your girl and she ridin'
But I'm in for it, I'm in for it
Call over your home girls, tell 'em I'm on it
No more excuses, you always do this
I know what I want, I know what I want
No more excuses, no more excuses

[Chorus]
Shawty, I want, shawty, I want
Whatever you want, whatever you want
Shawty, I want, shawty, I want
Whatever you want, whatever you want

[Verse 1]
Well, a nigga gotta get more, big game in a lil bit
I need, tall money and a lil bitch, come on
Kick game on Liu Kang
And my, whip game on Bruce Wayne, huh
I’m coolin' while I’m flickin' a cigar
Tell them bitches by the bar, they can fit up in my car
And shawty wanna kick it with a star
Her friend and ménage, she gon' get it all if she hop in, huh
Ridin' around town, ten bandos in this Moncler, now they wanna talk
Ridin' around town in a brand new CLA Mercedes, that I just bought
Ridin' around with a stainless, new .40 I got it for shawty
Ridin' around town with lil mama 'cause she know that I got her
As long as you are down, to fuck with a nigga, let's get it
I conquered, I hit it, I did it
You want me, I want you, let's get it, let's get it
I put shit down, fuck with your nigga, you with it
You with it, I'm with it
Just say that you with it, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hit a fifth of the bottle
And I'm in for it, I'm in for it
You and your girls in there ridin'
So I'm in for it, I'm in for it
Call over your home girls, tell 'em I'm on it
No more excuses, you always do this
I know what I want, I know what I want
No more excuses, no more excuses

[Chorus]
Shawty, I want, shawty, I want
Whatever you want, whatever you want
Shawty, I want, shawty, I want
Whatever you want, whatever you want

[Verse 2]
You a lil' freaky, you be sendin' me the pictures on the phone
Hit a nigga late night, tellin' me you tryna get it on
Don't waste a nigga time, don't waste a nigga time we grown, baby girl
There's a lot of girls, there's a lot of girls in my phone

[Voicemail]
Call me back when you can
I was just at work and now I just finished
So when you are not busy, just call me
At least before like, I fall asleep

[Verse 3]
Might drop a 10 in the 4
I'm so offended
I thought that you knew this before
I'm so offended, I'm so offended
I'll come through on the low
I'm so offended
I'm so offended for thinkin' that you would've known
How could you have known?
And those diamonds are really bright
I'm on my Goldeneye
I don't wanna talk to you
I might roll the dice
I want a bad bitch now
Need a bad bitch now
She a bad lil one, bad lil one
She's all that I want, she's all that I need
All that I got, checkin' for me, yeah
Might drop a 10 in the 4
I'm so offended
I thought that you knew this before
I'm so offended, I'm so offended
