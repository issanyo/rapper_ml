Keep talkin', females, keep talkin' me
I just keep a bitch cut, meat market, please
Say freeze like fuck it, I'm defrostin', pap
I gets green like Jack and the Beanstalk
And I do them hoes stone cold, Steve Austin
If you talkin' 'bout money, don't be bluffin', cheap talkin'
My team often tell me that we flossin'
Off in G4s, tell 'em send reinforcements
Got crazy divas in my ish
And my car strapped like it's baby seaters in the whip
I don't play 9 days,  bitches treatin' for a trick
Keep it money over bitches, won't repeat it for a chick
Yes, fresh all white Adidas in the whip
And if you're talkin' 'bout weed then Orangina is my shit
A couple grand for my feature is a bitch
I'd hate to be you but you would love to be this
Peep this G shit, T Lanez, G shit
I bring the wave to them haters, make them haters seasick
All the diamonds legit, all vagina we pick
With your girl in my livin' room playin' WiiFit
Get popped like 3 fits then shot like 3 flicks
And my kicks Asian like Kimora Lee's tits
Tell the waiter she can order me this
We's rich, we don't even act accordingly
It's the Mr. Nigga-Pick-Out-Your-Arteries, bitch
I wish a nigga would try to slaughter me
Follow me, Twitter, bitch
If you ain't got it, girl, get it, bitch
Make the bitch make you rich, sorta like that player shit
Cause nowadays bitches only wanna play the pimp
They get major, get paper then play the pimp
That's why I slide by, I be like, "Fuck a bitch"
After I fuck a bitch, I be like, "Fuck the bitch"
I run game, no cutter glitch, somethin' rich
Not tryna fuck, I'm tryna get head from your chick
And real talkin', I don't do it for the people
Ride through it like Kinevel, Swine Flu, you need a needle
Car doors writin' suicide notes to the people
I ain't trippin' off the eagle, my juice like a beetle
Beat it like I beat the pussy
Here's the heater, nigga, eat it like you eat the pussy
And y'all yappin', y'all never brought the heaters to me
So long nappin' if they never brought the sleeper to me
They like, "Aw man, Tory Lanez be that Tarzan"
Pay him 4 grand, leave him laid up in a far land
Tory garage like a farm, baby, all Lambs
With no mirage, all menage, baby, all them
With no Nicki, nigga, bitches rollin' with me
So much grands in my pants that my pants can't fit me
I dance quickly, baddest bitches can't get me
Now these hoes payin' me to even let 'em stand with me
Damn it pans out, like highlighters I stand out
Boom, like retirement homes, I bring them grams out
And this is just a verse of what the man's 'bout
So keep talkin', boy this whole shit's planned out
Yes, I'm ridin' on 'em like a G2
Plus I'm the shit, baby, mothafuckin' P.U
I'm on my P.Q.s, carrots look pre-juiced
Gon' and grab your chick and do the grown shit we do
Yes, I know these niggas 'bout to act scary
T.O. nigga, only spittin' without the BlackBerry
My niggas ballin', niggas, they never stallin'
I'm Mike Jordan with a Rawlings or a Spalding
All day, nigga, Kanye, nigga
'Bout to kill every nigga that was on Sway, nigga
Look I'm ballin' all day, nigga, say it to my nigga Pain
Niggas in this shit, they know I'ma get 'em entertained
I'ma get this shit intertwined, and get you in a strain
Niggas gettin' pissed but they know I gotta get 'em drained
Drained out, same game out, same safe house
Had to bust the trap back, brought it to the safe house
We was hittin' safe routes when Pain told me
You was gon' get this paper and I had the same homies
I knew shit was goin' crazy, I had the game on him
Niggas don't think it's crazy, get the thang on 'em
I'm 'bout to sip up on this ginger ale
These niggas still gettin' shit, they gotta give 'em bail
My nigga Kells, he up in his cell
We still talkin' like it's wi-fi up in his cell
I touch down just like it's NFL
Then I'm in the SSL, then I'm in a shorty named Vanessa Sail
I'm pullin' off the SLS sippin' V.S.O.P
They get me stressin', yeah I'm callin' up the SODs
Abbreviation talk, bang bang, hate to talk
And we pullin' up in matchin' cars because we hate to walk
