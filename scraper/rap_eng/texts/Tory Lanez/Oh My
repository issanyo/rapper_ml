[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Nigga my young boy Pressa
Y'all niggas know who the fuck it is

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I pull up and got no roof dawg, oh my
All my bitches yelling ouh boy, oh my
When I pull up in a brand new, oh my
Fit two bitches in a coupe dawg
Oh my, oh my, oh my (ho!)
Oh my, oh my, oh my (ho!)
Oh my, oh my, oh my (ho!)
Oh my, oh my, oh my (ho!)
Oh my, oh my, oh my (ho!)

[Verse 1: Pressa]
Type you couldn’t hold
No control no calibration
She gon' freak whoever
She want freak this
I can take it
She down to party with the kid like its a celebration
She just found a star
Starrah girl congratulations
Ooh I’m wasted Henny couldn’t waste it
She so dtf, the funny thing she so impatient
She gon lie she taking but she decide to save it
Ordinary black boy, why she find me so amazing?
Ooh I’m wasted Henny couldn’t waste it
She so dtf, the funny thing she so impatient
She gon lie she taking but she decide to save it
Ordinary black boy, why she find me so amazing?
I got the TuneCore
This didn’t just happen this was something that I asked for
She confused she a hoe
She gon' ride me like a woe
She quit school to work the pole
Now it's back to both
I got more waves then a boat
I get more money than most
Bundled up like Eskimoes
Swerveroad niggas do the most
I got the wave, I got the sauce
Oops I mean the wass
She wanna steal my fame
Cause I’m buzzing like a wasp
(wass, wass, wass)

Oh my, oh my, oh my (ho!)
Oh my, oh my, oh my (ho!)
