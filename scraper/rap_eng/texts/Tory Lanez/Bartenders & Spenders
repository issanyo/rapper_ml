[Intro]
Shit, I used to be in love and now that's finished
And it's usually a dub, tonight I'm wit' it
All that dancin' in the club, girl, you bartendin'

[Verse 1]
She been workin' at Starlets
Said she don't dance, she just bartend
Shawty got the whole fuckin' bar lit
Bring the bottles to the ting, get the squad lit
Sippin' on the way, on the way
And she got the work, got the work
Need to fly you out right now
Need to get you to the house right now, got a lot right now
It's some niggas in ya' past that
If I see you with 'em, I can promise I'll be out right now
You wouldn't say I'm actin' out right now
But it just ain't the time to doubt right now
I promise, you know that I'm honest
I promise to keep this shit true
I've been down from the bando
Work that we flipped and the line rolls
Trap queen working at the bando
Trap king gettin' to the bands though
Now you went and got another man's dough
How you went and fucked up the plans though? No, no
Swear I used to be in love and now that's finished
You wasn't used to being loved and I can't trip
I wasn't supposed to be in love with you, just sittin'
I wasn't supposed to give a fuck, but girl, I'm sick

[Hook]
Girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, can't lie I'm sick
Girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, can't lie I'm sick
Girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick

[Verse 2]
You already know, I know that you know
(Shoutout Problem)
She go to Liv on a Sunday
Can't even give me that one day no more
You said you would never change
And look how you changed, we don't even do things
You left on me, for some new things
You got a new thing but I know you miss what we had
And I know what I done did was fucked up
But you just don't get me back like that, no, no, no
How you gon' let another nigga get one up on me?
Part of me say, "Fuck you," part of me like, "I need you"
'Fore the feelings, waiter please bring me a Dom P (yeah, uh)

[Hook]
Deep down I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick
Can't lie I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick
Can't lie I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick, girl I'm sick
You already know, I know that you know
She used to be in love, she used to be a dove
She used to be the one
She used to be the one as usually in all the clubs
She used to be the one
She used to pull up at the crib, two-thirty
Six in the mornin'
