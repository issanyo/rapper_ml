Selfish

[Intro]
Tell me is that
Tell me is that

[Chorus]
I'm not 'bout to lie on it
We don't even talk, oh no no more
So I'm not 'bout to lie on it
You can't be no one else's
'Cause I'm selfish, I'm selfish
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is it selfish? Am I selfish?
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is that selfish?
Tell me is that selfish?

[Verse 1]
Short black nigga in the Benzo
Dutch rolled in the endzone
Who you with when it ain't me?
Girl, don't try to put me in the friendzone
Young nigga, still ride with 'em on the low low
I Benz drop with the Hunna low low
Look, you my chick, let her full trick
While am still shootin' with numerous shots from the .44
I done moved on
But I don't want you to go home
I don't I want you to move on
I don't want you to see me at the light
But you do and I got another you on my futon
All in together, Jane and Finch where I met her
Thinkin' 'bout it all in the present
That was that 4-1
I would never forfeit on bullshit
And you would never fold for my cheddar
I was young successful, young and reckless
Runnin' reckless, tryna find the time to check it
It was wrong, I thought that time would tell
But damn, I fucked it up, and now I guess I'm just
Selfish, I'm selfish
'Cause I moved on and I don't want you boo
Selfish, I'm selfish
When I move on and I don't want you too
I'm selfish, I'm selfish
Just a young unlucky motherfucker in a Beemer
I need ya to myself and then I leave ya
I did the same shit with Tina, Gina, Ashley and even Leena
Believe me, this shit hard but I make it look easy
For the go, got the crack on the low
You leave and I'm back in for more, young nigga

[Chorus]
I'm not 'bout to lie on it
We don't even talk, oh no no more
So I'm not 'bout to lie on it
You can't be no one else's
'Cause I'm selfish, I'm selfish
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is it selfish? Am I selfish?
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is that selfish?
Tell me is that selfish?

[Verse 2]
Was thinkin' of the days when
We was teens in a basement
100 V's in the case uh
Young nigga with a dream, just chasin'
Big cake, lil nigga, no birthday
Backwood for the worst day
With a 1 back then I would back when
I was in the city of my my birthplace
Young girl runnin' with the keys to my heart
Shit hard but my heart so cold that it key wouldn't start it
Made a pact to my bosses
That if it don't go right I'ma keep you apart
In the future, it sound loose but it's truthful
And I ain't stupid, I know you out there lookin' for
Somethin' new but I know you still missin' what you used to
Love and lust and sex and trust and next is guess
I fucked it up and yes I know I will regret the extra stuff
Well stop me there 'cause that's enough
Been young and wild, we take for granted
All the things you planted in this life, we know you made for us
It's dangerous just to maintain us, babe, look uh
I'm the nigga out there
I don't know what was salty at all
But you know shit different out there
Back then, I was always downtown like I'm livin' out there
Nigga, these days I be in a new Lear
New key cup, blue pool clear
Only thing missin' is a bad one
Fuck that only thing missin' girl is you here
I been I be tryna front though
Only tellin' ainâ€™t nobody I can front for
Yeah, when I'm runnin' right back on the low
Got the crack for the low
When you leave then I'm back in for more, young nigga

[Chorus]
I'm not 'bout to lie on it
We don't even talk, oh no no more
So I'm not 'bout to lie on it
You can't be no one else's
'Cause I'm selfish, I'm selfish
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is it selfish? Am I selfish?
I don't wanna be selfish
Tell me is that selfish?
Tell me is that selfish?

York University

[Verse]
Young nigga ridin' up and down the boulevard
I know I fucked up, yeah, it's all my fault
If it was up to me, it wouldn't be this hard
If it was up to me, we'd be inside your dorm room
Fuckin' just like we inside your dorm room
You'll remember me, I put it on you, oh oh
Take Steeles all the way down to York University to put it on you
I'm the one that you was with first time that you smoked weed
I put it on you
And I'm back out here at York University
Why am I trying to find you
What if it's not you but the feelin' of you
That always reminds me
That I'm right back here at York University
Where we used to try
Hopin' one more day we can try
