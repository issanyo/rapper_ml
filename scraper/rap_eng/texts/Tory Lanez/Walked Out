[Hook]
Walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away
Walked right out of heaven
Don't know what to, don't know what, feels like I

[Verse 1]
Whippin' down, 95
Beggin' God to (please forgive me)
I'll mess it up, what heaven done gave to me
I can see (everything clearer now)
These tints are black as, (black as it's ever been)
Now without my rider, I might shoot somethin' up out here
So I pray that he just, (just shed his grace on me)
Because you let her leave, now
No don't you let her leave, no

[Hook]
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, get back right with you
Feels like I just walked right out

[Verse 2]
Someone told me that if it’s meant to be
She’ll wake up one day, and she’ll forgive me
So the best thing I can do
Is to just let her, let her go, I know
And the more I push, the more she pulls away from me
So I’m asking God for help, Lord I’m just a G
And I need her, I didn’t treat her the way she was meant to be treated
'Cause Lord I did her wrong and she’s gon' leave again

[Hook]
Feels like I just walked right out of heaven
Feels like I have damn near thrown my life away, hey
Scared, just like a child that's lost at seven
Don't know what to do, get back right with you
Feels like I
