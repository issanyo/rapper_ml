[Intro]
Yeah, hey, what up, baby?
Hey
I know you like me, but is it my pockets, babe?
I know you like me, but is it my pockets, babe?

[Chorus]
Oh, shawty be frontin' like my main hoe
But I know she only want me for my pay roll, ayo
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type
Oh baby, I know you like Swave
Lookin' for a G to get you things you never had, babe
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type

[Verse 1]
See she was Christian before, now it's Christian Dior
More bags on the dinner shop, let yours in store
Now she all that, where that what you call that
You give her your number, it's a wonder if she call back
Used to compliment me, used to call me nice names
Now the only time she callin' me is for a pricin'
Thinkin' it the gravy, used to be my lady
Ever since that paper, baby, she been actin' shady
Feeln' like a candy kid at the mall
Hair, manicured nails, maxin' out my cards
Tryna keep it faithful, no relaxin' with the broads
Now to find out that my passion was a fraud
Man, I must be dumb, even though she bad
She can't be the one, she just want my cash
Ooh, girl, you so scandalous, baby
And if you ain't got no money, you can't handle this lady, no no

[Chorus]
Oh, shawty be frontin' like my main hoe
But I know she only want me for my pay roll, ayo
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type
Oh baby, I know you like Swave
Lookin' for a G to get you things you never had, babe
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type

[Verse 2]
I was like, "Hey pretty thing, can I get your name?"
She replied laughin' and didn't say a thing
Damn, I felt ashamed but then I used my brain
Opened up my coat and showed her two diamond chains
When I met her, yeah the deed just got exchanged
Before I hit the range, she gave me a phone call
Told me if I played her right, she'll take all the gloves off
Man, this hoe is so lost and scandalous

[Chorus]
Oh, shawty be frontin' like my main hoe
But I know she only want me for my pay roll, ayo
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type
Oh baby, I know you like Swave
Lookin' for a G to get you things you never had, babe
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type

[Bridge]
I don't know why these girls, they want something from me, from me
I don't know why these girls, they want something from me, from me
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know

[Chorus]
Oh, shawty be frontin' like my main hoe
But I know she only want me for my pay roll, ayo
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type
Oh baby, I know you like Swave
Lookin' for a G to get you things you never had, babe
Don't I know ya, don't I know ya
I swear girl, I know your type
