[Verse 1]
Shit was all good now but it ainâ€™t like it used to be
You was by my side but you ain't like you used to be, damn
Oh go head and say that I'm wrong for you
This shit might be wrong but it sound like the truth to me, tell me
I know I'm wrong but ask
I always end up with them glamour girls, that's your type
And then keep runnin' into problems that I did before
You always been that random go and hit the floor type
Even when I would tell you I know
Praise God for sunshine, oh
Sunshine on me, shine for you
When it's rainin' on me oh
How do we love this oh?

[Chorus]
We ain't even friends, we just actin' like it
I don't wanna pretend
All I know it's somethin' new, it's somethin' new
Holla at me oh, holla at me oh
We ain't even friends, we just actin' like it
I don't wanna pretend
All I know it's somethin' new, it's somethin' new
Holla at me oh, holla at me
'Cause I got it, I think I got it
I think I got it, think I got it, girl

[Verse 2]
Lookin' for the girls with their hair and their nails on fleek
Bad little girl and she came out here for the weekend
She ain't gon' do it for you niggas but she do it for the team
She down for the freakin'
When I'm lookin' for the girls on road
You the one that's the word on road
I won't lie I see me with it
Ridin' down in the S 63 with it
Fuck around made way more money than I made last week
Made more honeys than a nigga banged last weekend
But I'm givin' no fucks in the top down freakin'
Couple hoes in the telly and that's why I'm not speakin'
'Cause I know

[Chorus]
We ain't even friends, we just actin' like it
I don't wanna pretend
All I know it's somethin' new, it's somethin' new
Holla at me oh, holla at me oh
We ain't even friends, we just actin' like it
I don't wanna pretend
All I know it's somethin' new, it's somethin' new
Holla at me oh, holla at me
'Cause I got it, I think I got it
I think I got it, think I got it, girl
