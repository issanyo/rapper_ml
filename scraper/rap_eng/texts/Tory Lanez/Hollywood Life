[Intro]
Check, check. 1, 2. Let's do it. Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
In Hollywood I'm shootin', I'm aimin' for your heart
You in movies, but baby, you play the star
Oh, that girl, that girl that don't notice me
And I wanna stay in there and want you to know it's me
Slide a ring on your index, buy you a white gown
Actually bought that, I'll buy you a nightgown
For you to spend one night and you to lay right here
'Cause you in my thoughts, in my dreams, even nightmares
I think I'm goin' crazy, or maybe I'm just obsessed
To see them hurt you, make me upset
See baby, you ain't found the one yet
And I just wanna be your sunset
So I'm hopin' that you see 'em
That nigga ain't your life, I wanna be him
And you, you say you tired of him leavin' ya
But even I can see the future from keepin' ya
I know just what you want, babe
And you want me to love you
So I give you my all, babe

[Chorus]
But instead of you I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that
I know just what you want, babe
And you want me to love you
So I give you my all, babe
But instead of you
I probably love that that

[Verse 2]
That Hollywood life, Hollywood status on Hollywood nights
A Hollywood actress on Hollywood flights
Afflicted and addicted by the Hollywood lights
Like I am, but damn, we know we got a purpose
And I ain't even begin to reach the surface
But I swear that you the Earth's gift
We spendin' time, baby 'cause I know you worth it
Dislike us, they can't dislike us
Long as your thumbs up, baby, hitch hike love
And if you ever need for any God damn reason
I swear that my heart stop beatin'
It sound like, quiet
'Cause girl, I'm on a diet for your love
You try me and I swear you'll realise who the one
Even my girl say don't leave her for that Hollywood
She say don't leave her for that Hollywood
To tell the truth, look, I probably would
To tell the truth, look, I probably would

[Chorus]
Instead of you I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that Hollywood life, Hollywood life
I said I probably love that
I know just what you want, babe
And you want me to love you
So I give you my all, babe
But instead of you
I probably love that that
I probably love that that
I said I probably love that that
I said I probably love that that
I probably love that that

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Hollywood
