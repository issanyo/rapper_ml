All this time
All this time
Oh no...
All this soul
All these bitches I fuck
Spend that dough and blow that bitch, I live a rush
All the time (x3)

[Verse 1: Zero]
Until they break off
I'm taking your face off
Take your body to the casket and bury it in graveyard
They're safe if you hate, dawg
Conserving the bass, dawg
I'm the future, who are you?
You ain't leaving a trace, dawg
I got a lot of problems, I don't got a lot
Got bodied by the God, got another one on my mind
Been feening for Selena, she trying to sodomized
I was looking for somebody but fuck it, I couldn't find
I don't got no time for the shit you portray in your music
I've seen you in person, you fraud
Ain't bending the law
If you never put your fist up for something, bitch don't get involved
Fuck making a call, I'll take you wherever you are, we can meet up on Broad
Meet up on fifteen with Reese and I'll sign all you off
Don't front like you hard, we can make this a brawl
Innovative, venomous plot
We stand in the shot
We never miss the target, we've been in, in the drop
We tending the plot, and killing
We don't got a single target, we gon' take
If you there isn't an intention then stop
I don't got nobody
Like really, nobody
I did this shit all by myself
Give a fuck if you help
Give a fuck for the twelve-hundred dollars you spend on your belt

All this time
All this time
Oh no...
All this soul
All these bitches I fuck
Spend that dough and blow that bitch, I live a rush
All the time (x9)
Spend that dough and blow that bitch, I live a rush
All the time (x3)

[Verse 2: Zero]
It's the time for the greatest, they kick the door in
Barely ever talk cause we give it, we like [?]
Working, working for the ice, like the weather
Whenever we storming, better report it
Trying to get foreign, time isn't money [?]
We don't, we don't talk, we say shit, action
Never debate this, one of the greatest, imma make shit happen
Me and the team, getting the dream, fuck you say 'bout that shit?
Motherfucker you ain't never seeing me with this rap shit, I am:
Possibly the greatest
Obviously the favorite
If your girl playing my shit it's obvious that you hate it
You a bitch and on the low you been dying to go replay it
Bitch is basic, you a fake, you might as well mo'fucking face it, I'm the:
Realist, the realist
Fuck what you think real is
If you ain't protecting your spot, I'm proudly going to steal it
All the bitching and complaining, you really should go conceal it
I heard you missed the real shit, well I'm trying to give you the feelings
This music shit is a stamp
Re-creating G-Unit's, my camp
Buddies, buddies, bitches at hand
That want to fuck with the man
I give her dick 'til she cramp
I'm running everything, now taking a stand
It's a long time coming in this bullshit business
Y'all be acting tough until the bullshit's witnessed
Talk about you running, that's some bullshit fitness
You ain't never been a rapper? That's some bullshit, bitches
