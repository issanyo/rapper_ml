[Verse 1]
I just called to say hello
Remember me from junior high? Your little guy
Do you recall that beautiful note I wrote?
Said circle yes if you wanna be mine, all mine
Prom night, you were beautiful
You wore the heels with your dress, girl, you were fresh
But there's just one thing you should know, woah
Breakin' up with you, I do regret, oh I do regret

[Chorus]
Hello, I just called to say hello
Hello, oh I'm just callin' your phone to say
Hello, girl, I just called you to say
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello today

[Verse 2]
I can't recall the last we spoke
Don't even remember the fight
The years have gone and time has grown
But you'll always be on my mind, my mind
Girl, you used to give me so much joy
I can't say I don't miss your laugh, your laugh, yeah
Passin' notes in all our class
Say, truth is, girl, I want you back, you back, you back

[Chorus]
Hello, I just called to say hello
Hello, oh I'm just callin' your phone to say
Hello, girl, I just called you to say
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello today
