[Verse]
I really hope you never ever get to love me
I'm thinking of all the times that you dubbed me
Now that I'm poppin' you got me right where I want though
Right where I wanted to be where you would love me
Caught you slippin' in Liv and sippin' bubbly
You took a look at these niggas, ain't none above me
I tried to give you my heart but girl you don't know
I tried to show you affection but no it won't show
I told you baby just wait, we need some time but no
As soon as you love me give me some time to ball
The way you would get, it's like a thousand dollars
But my confidence took every ounce to holla
I really hope you never get to love me
I wanna be somewhere stuntin, sippin' the bubbly
Not even a thought of you in my mind
Visions of you went blind
Oh you used to call just to tell me
That you didn't all the way get it but you felt me
Part of the reason why I always try to tell you
You held it down, I'ma get you the bag with the Chanel Cs
'Cause it was us against the world, fuck what they tell me
I figured they was hating on us and it was jealousy
But I shoulda listened to the shit they were tellin' me
I thought you were takin' a W, it was just a L on me
Now I'm caught up in this situation with L-O-V like the best of me
I'm tryna find somethin', tryna align somethin'
Still been praying that you'd be my somethin'
Out late, hoping and praying that you ain't dubbing me
I know I treat you better than your man, yeah, fuck that nigga
