First off baby, I'm too wavy
For all this bullshit that you bring me
And I done denied you way before this
But girl, that was back and now you're gorgeous, oh no

You got what I need, yeah
You say I'm just a friend, woah baby

I pull up, don't deny me
'Cause baby, it drives me crazy
When you say I'm just a friend (Damn)
Woah, yeah, I wanna be the nigga that you call on
I wanna be the one to give you some
I wanna be the one to woah
I know what this sound like, it's crazy

I know that just sound cliché, maybe
I'm more than just a friend, pretty lady

So why do you flirt with me and then
(Say I'm just a friend)?
Ooh, this time
I wanna do it better this time
I wanna get me out the friend zone
It is so good that your friends know
I know what this sound like, it's brazy
You know how I get down, I'm crazy
'Fore you in it, go down, I'm blazin'
'Cause I'm not just a friend

[Hook]
You got what I need
Say I'm just a friend, woah, yeah

Plus I know you know I'm fly
Now gimme one good reason why
You wouldn't want this type of guy
'Cause I stay lit, I stay fresh
Plus you know I know I'm fly, yeah
