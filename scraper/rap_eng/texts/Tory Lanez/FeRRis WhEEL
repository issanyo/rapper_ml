[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
We stay lit, all that shit
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
That's the red nose shawty, you a dog, lil' bitch
Touch the damn floor with your paws, lil' bitch
Shake that fat ass on my balls, lil' bitch
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
Shaking all off the wall, what you call that shit?
Damn, lil' baby what you call that shit? Yeah

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Baby, come and get some cash
Damn, lil' baby, that's a whole lotta ass
Got me feeling like Steve Nash
With a milk mustache, damn, I'm MVP, yeah
Baby, why you taking two seats? Yeah
Don't clap your hands, baby, clap them cheeks, yeah
Going brazy on the motherfucking D, yeah
Keep dancing, Happy Feet

[Interlude]
This is a speech to all you Instagram girls thinking it's cute when you twerking, 'kay?
I don't want to see your ass jiggling everywhere, do you Jenny?
No, I just text

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
We stay lit, all that shit
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
That's the red nose shawty, you a dog, lil' bitch
Touch the damn floor with your paws, lil' bitch
Shake that fat ass on my balls, lil' bitch
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
Shaking all off the wall, what you call that shit?
Damn, lil' baby what you call that shit? Yeah

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Lil Tory!
Girl, you look good when you back that ass up
Know I look good when I back the cash out
Shawty from the hood and I'm back in the trap house
Talk that shit 'til you back to your dad's house
I'm a real nigga from the T and O
I got a bad little bitch that let me beat on the floor
I remember nights I used to sleep on the floor
I see them days, I don't ever wanna go back no more
Now my little bitch wanna fuck my bitch and I'ma let her fuck her
Pull up in a new estate, I got a Bentley truck
Got Ciroc, in the shot, like it came from Diddy
Got 100 wild niggas that won't change for pussy
Hey, how you doin'? Let me whisper in your ear
Tell you a lil' something you might like to hear
You know I be with star niggas like Trippie Redd
And if I whip this dick out, girl, you're giving me head

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
We stay lit, all that shit
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
That's the red nose shawty, you a dog, lil' bitch
Touch the damn floor with your paws, lil' bitch
Shake that fat ass on my balls, lil' bitch
Damn, lil' baby, what you call that shit?
Shaking all off the wall, what you call that shit?
Damn, lil' baby what you call that shit? Yeah
