[Verse 1]
Drugs in mornin', pain in my side
Out there it's war and when my life gets hard

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you're scared, take my hand
You can feel again
I won't tell no one
You secrets safe with me
Mind all I've got
Baby, let's sing to me

[Chorus]
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody

[Verse 2]
I'm so deep inside
I might sink tonight
Just hold on my hand, don't be afraid
We're livin' for the risk, girl
And I know, I know, I know
I can't save you from sinking tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you're scared, take my hand
You can feel again

[Chorus]
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody

[Bridge]
Baby, I want you to get that
Baby, I need you to get that
Whatever you gone girl, just get that
Whatever you go, as long as you get back
Baby, I want you to get that
Baby, I need you to get that
Whatever you gone girl, just get that
Whatever you go, as long as you get back
Baby, I want you to get that
Baby, I need you to get that
Whatever you gone girl, just get that
Whatever you go, as long as you get back
Baby, I want you to get that
Baby, I need you to get that
Whatever you gone girl, just get that
Whatever you go, as long as you get back

[Chorus]
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody
Now you don't want no one else
Nobody, nobody
