[Intro]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I see you over there, baby
I'm screamin' loud but you ain't listenin'
Why you standin' on the wall?
Tight dress and all that
You know you lookin' swavey, baby
I'm a real swavey dude
So get with the Playboy
Lemme talk to you

[Verse 1]
You look a lil too mean
Just stop walking, let me talk to ya
Her body, I ain't ever seen
I said I gotta thank your mom for ya
'Cause look what she gave you
The face of an angel
Said I can swear that you was sent right from the heavens
She be rockin' Js, I think your favourites is the 7

[Pre-Chorus]
I would do it all for you
Said they should do it all for you
And girl, I swear that them jeans you wearin' lookin' swavey
You should let me talk 'em off of you
Hey girl, you got me fired up
And no, I don't wanna leave
Unless I leave with you
So tell me, are you hearing me? Oh baby

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm excited
I want you near me
So I'm screaming loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
But you never hear me
Girl, I'm excited
I want you near me
So I'm screaming loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
But you never hear me

[Verse 2]
You got a walk so mean
Slow down and let me walk with you
I said you're something like a work of art
But you look better than a picture
And she the flyest
It's just bein' honest
Now shawty, tell me where you goin' with them jeans on
She be lookin' real like somethin' I ain't ever seen before

[Pre-Chorus]
I would do it all for you
Said they should do it all for you
And girl, I swear that them jeans you wearin' lookin' swavey
You should let me talk 'em off of you
And girl, I know we ain't in love
But my heart is in your hands
So please don't break it, no
Why won't you give me a chance? Oh baby

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm excited
I want you near me
So I'm screaming loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
But you never hear me
Girl, I'm excited
I want you near me
So I'm screaming loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
But you never hear me

[Bridge]
Hey, shawty, leave with me tonight
'Cause I'm the one you need in life, oh yeah
Shawty, leave with me tonight, tonight, tonight
'Cause I'm the one you need in life, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm excited
I want you near me
So I'm screaming loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
But you never hear me
Girl, I'm excited
I want you near me
So I'm screaming loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud, loud
But you never hear me
