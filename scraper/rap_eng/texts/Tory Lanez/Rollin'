Rollin'

[Verse 1: YF]
Shout out to them corporate niggas
Ambition leaders that's poppin' tags
Gold watches, on the pill, Oxycontin with a Xan
My niggas, they be rollin'
Putting business over everything
Females running, haters haters
Money be the wedding ring
2 seats in my coupe
Top down when I'm leanin'
Pussy niggas, they be scheming
Cause my rooftop receding
And my style be the cleanest
Why yo bitch on my penis, nigga

Fuck it, I'mma switch it up

Niggas wanna talk till' the clip go bang
Drinking my cup like Kurt Cobain
Alexander be the shoes
Golden Stallion be ring
Hipster chick with coke in her nose
Servin' bitches off the stove
And she's getting freaky
Now the bitch is taking off her clothes
Five-three, long hair, YF he need all of those
As long as you keep that pussy tight
We could keep it on the low
Under the influence what I say
Yeah it fucking goes

Now I got that bitch rollin'

[Hook]
Sour on the table
Now you know a nigga rollin'

Shorty popped a molly
Now you know that bitch is rollin'

YOLO is the motto
And there's Rosie in my bottle
And we under the influence what I do
Yeah they follows so they

Rollin'

[Verse 2: Torey Lanez]
YOLO ain't my motto but
Polo is my lago I mean loco
When she actin' stupid she a no-go
I be dolo
Jumped up on my dick like a pogo
Shit's get going
Flick on on the pic
Just a glimpse of the flyest nigga
You have ever witnessed
I'm so godly, bitches wet like Poseidon
No hiding, shoot you while you in your car
Ghost riding, mothafucka
Hahahaha

[Verse 3: KingNevSupreme]
Bitch I'm rollin' like a motorcycling beast
Too much bumps of MDMA homie I ain't slept in weeks
All a nigga remember is constantly changing the sheets throughout the weeks
All the bitches think a trippy nigga [?]
KingNev copped the best
Hold it down by the play
Make this money day by day
How I get it, I don't say
I own a secret society

Bitch I'm NevSupreme

[Hook]
