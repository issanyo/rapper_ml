[Chorus]
Let's leave the past behind the master mind of love
Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?
You know what I'm sayin'
She comin' down real clean on 'em shit

[Verse 1]
Memories are just wrong, me and my niggas holdin'
Smokin' loud in the parkin' lot, tryna chap teens and enroll
Little niggas just gettin' it, pool party we dip in it
17 and I'm extra leanin' and no model chick stand next to me
I'm in there, swimmin' wear 'til the lights out and it's dim next
My niggas sayin it's fuck that, I hit the jam and take bus back
Nigga, 9th grade was all that, skippin' class with no hall pass
I had a crush on lil Kiki but that damn girl ain't never call back
And we so young
You and I get higher then a fuckin' tube sock
We hit the west to 2Pac
And I wish I can get this fuckin' pictures in 'cause they gone

[Chorus]
Let's leave the past behind the master mind of love
Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?
This that SLS nigga
Swavey

[Verse 2]
I remember tellin' Keisha put that ass on the floor
Lil nigga rolling', whip stolen, hands on my dope
I'm gettin' this cash, tonight I'm gon' smash
Fuck waitin', debatin' where we gon' end up when it pass
We up in the lot, some comin' down
Losin' you when you lyin', tune to Tuesday, you buyin'
Star nigga O'Brian, bad bitches on my end
Two 50 for the bus fare, I'm fresh as swave so it's fuck yeah
Don't take that shit, don't talk shit, I hit the movie don't watch the shit
And that's young niggas we on loud
Baggin' chicks and smack a nigga, calm down
Now niggas causin' troubles all now
'Cause this the movie, sip the jam, let me know if you down

[Chorus]
Let's leave the past behind the master mind of love
Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?

[Bridge]
Wait this here, this for the city, this for the city of a thousand dreams
This for the city, this for the city of a thousand dreams

[Chorus]
Let's leave the past behind the master mind of love
Try to enjoy the moments I won't get again
After graduation, when time goes past, remember me for long
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do our high school memories go?
Where do they go?
