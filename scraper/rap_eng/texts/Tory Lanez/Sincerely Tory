[Intro]
Hello? Hello?
Is anybody up here?
Ah, fuck
Where the hell am I?
What, what is this?
Ah
Welcome
Just a lil bit
Look bruh

[Chorus]
I’m tryna live life
Fuck where I am
I’m tryna live life
Well, here go the plan
Ay, ay this a toast
To all my people in the room out livin’ it
And this a toast
To nobody in the room forgettin’ it
This shit is sincerely Tory

[Verse 1]
How did we, uh, how did we get here?
Is it cold out? Is it wet there?
Where the fuck are we?
Did we pay for this? Is it jet fare?
Nah, this is full from the heart, this a nigga art
Nigga this, nigga that, this a nigga bar, what?
Right before that nigga start
I like to state, this is where that fake shit depart
I’m Mr. Cool Man, dropped outta school man
The long bread, never caught dead at a school dance
That’s what they call me
But if I had a dollar for all the times that the fuckin’ school shit stalled me
Nigga I’da been rich now with two in the tin house
The view of the penthouse, a slu in the French blouse
The rootings of life is in the booth when I write
I speak my mind and I’m sure that I say the truth to the mic
I’m in my air call yaredals with Mrs. Long Hair
With her lipstick smeared on, her bra strap near gone
That don’t even sound right but your shit sound like
Nah, not even a sound byte
Man it ain’t worth it, man it ain’t worth shit
I made some bad choices 'cause damn, I ain’t perfect
I know when this come out they’ll be like, “Damn you ain’t heard this”
And when your shit come out they’ll be like, “I ain’t heard worse shit”
My back to the bullshit, I’m back to my business
I’m crunchin’ my numbers like I was back to my fitness
And you catchin’ feelings, nigga, I’m catchin’ your bitch ass
'Cause all my niggas fly like we tryna get jetlag, I’m gone
I’m gone
I’m gone
Gone
So gone

[Chorus]
I’m tryna live life
Motherfuck where I am
I’m tryna live life
Well here goes the plan
This shit is sincerely Tory
