[Verse]
Can't believe I fell in love with her
Now I don't even wanna fuck with her
Feel like nothing's ever enough with her
Barely checkin' to see what's up with her
'Cause I had some player traits that I let you take away
You said you'll stay the same and look how you changed your ways
And I feel like it's half way my fault 'cause I just
I fell in love with her, knowin' exactly what it was with her
Knowin' nothin' could ever ever be enough with her
I split up with her
And when I feel like I need it and she come up again
Back it up, again
Then we fight and we fuss and then we love, we lust
And then we kiss, we touch and then we fuck again
We used to fuck all day
We'd rotate them blunts all day
You were down to hit that lick
We would split that shit both ways, oh
But you don't know
If it ain't love what we come for?
Let them hoes be in the front rows
While you and me count these hundos
