[Hook]
Question is, can you forgive me baby
Can you even forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I love you from a distance
It got me so persistent
I love you from a distance
It got me so persistent

[Verse 1]
My shorty had an abortion for me like 3 times
As hard is that to say that to y'all
I think it's much harder to keep it silent
I hide emotion behind a face that's devoted
To only winnin' this race and this pussy, money and violence
How could I be so selfish and need this time for myself?
Needing time for your health, to recover, I'm on some other
I'm out there sellin' soaps to these fiends, hopin' for dough for more myself
23 like is there hope for myself?
Cause if I never have a kid again, I'll be pissed but I deserve it
I been cursed with all these man made ways
In this earth that I been livin' in
Sorry for the present problems that I put you on and get you in
Father God, take my soul if I can't play my role
Cause I know what I'm doin', it ain't right, it ain't wrong
But in mid decisions, takin' life ain't the way of life
Cause day and night, I pray to Christ
In all hopes you would forgive me, shawty
Would you forgive me?

[Hook]
Question is, can you forgive me baby
Can you even forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent

[Verse 2]
Hopped off the phone with my dad, niggas barely do speak
But I'm sending Western Union wires every two weeks
I got a brand new brother and sister that I never do see
He might call to send me a blessing and tell me do me
But shit, I been doin' me since 14
4 court cases, court scene, 4 courses caught clean
Corner boy fortune, unfortunate dope fiends
That got a nigga cuffed in the court with these lawyer fees
And I just felt the game callin' me "A"
Felt like Mitch in Paid in Full
In a world that's gon' pay me full
Dropped out of school, them teachers just called me fool
Packed the black bag up, I'm back on my bull
You always told me these problems would soon catch up to me
And shit is catchin' up and fuckin' me up
Fourth quarter hustlin', I'm 'bout to sell a 3 up
If the Ds come, I'm gone
Pop, please forgive me for this song, gotta understand

[Hook]
Question is, can you forgive me baby
Can you even forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?

[Verse 3]
I really contemplated killin' you
Grippin' and cluthin' the side this pistol in my hand
Used to be my fam dawg, you used to be my mans
Sorry, outta respect for your mama I say your name, but I can't look
Niggas would say they love and wanna kill you
This feeling's feelin' familiar, I felt it for way too long
Feelin' like the feelin' you felt was way too strong
It felt like jealousy was just weighin' in on your dome
Should've cut ties, man I should've cut ties
Lord please, Lord please forgive my young eyes
I was young and unwise, I was just so naive
I was just trying believe, I was trying to perceive
But them niggas, they were greed, they was livin' outta greed
Now I'm livin' out the dream, cookin' kitchen outta steam
And you gotta feel me
Yacht master on a yacht looking filthy
That's why they do not feel me
You dig?

[Hook]
Question is, can you forgive me baby
Can you even forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
Can you forgive me for the way I love you?
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
I love you from a distance
It becomes so persistent
