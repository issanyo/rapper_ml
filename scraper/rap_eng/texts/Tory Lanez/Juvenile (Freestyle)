[Intro]
No dead ass I  got a story about this one joint. I'm-I'ma sing it to her. She know who the fuck she is. Let's get it

[Verse 1]
Shawty, I ain't seen you in a cold minute
That shit just made me wonder who's in it
That shit just made me wonder who's gettin' it
Now you gotta tell me whose is it
Girl, I used to fuck you in Toronto
On the Lakeshore, by the condo
I would give it to you, not for for sale
And she from the East, gotta meet at Yorkdale
Shawty, when we meet , gotta fuck for real
Took the TTC just to get the whole meal
And we used to fuck, girl, it was so trill
You remind me of Monica, you was so real
I know I'm wrong, sippin' on Patron
In LAC all night, but I ain't lackin' tonight
Now shawty, I'ma take it, if you don't give it to me
You gon' throw it like you tryna give it to me
I'ma play this Jodeci and all the records
Fuck you in the night and take you out to breakfast
I'm a young nigga, I got old money
Need the dough before I walk inside the door money
Take them heels off, walk inside my door honey
Start to peel off, peelin' off them clothes for me
I know, I know
Fuckin' bitches off my songs
In the stands at the show
I keep it real, I got love for them all
Hop inside a bus and get this thang poppin'
I got it biggie, but it ain't poppin'
Your nigga broke or he a chain swapper
I been poppin' all them niggas since the bottom
Tell 'em bitches let 'em leave with this Tory nigga
Why you playin'? What I'm sayin', just let Tory get you
Your nigga Tory bust that shot like Robert Horry, nigga
It's hard to spend time on these hoes, they can't afford me, nigga
On top of that, I keep the piece because these mans be looking for me, nigga
'Cause I had they ex-bitches in a orgy, nigga
Catch a nigga down Toronto, smokin' OG, nigga
Your bitch is fuckin' 'cause she want to fuck a OG, nigga
I know, I know, I've been on Patron
In L.A. all night, in up here with your wife
Can I give some love? Don't you give that dove
I could do things to your life, I change shit in one night
