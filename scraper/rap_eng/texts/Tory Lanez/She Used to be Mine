[Intro]
You used to be mine
You used to be mine
Sendin' this one now to a lil lady out there. I used to see her, I mean, she used to be mine, right

[Verse 1]
Look, reminiscin' on the times we had
Made things fine when the times was bad
I couldn't write a rhyme to define your class
Even though I spent time 'til the timin' passed
You used to rock two shoes, miss beautiful
Jimmy Choo shoes and the kiss you would do
From my heart, girl, you had me from the start
There was somethin' 'bout her, I couldn't live without her
The good love with somethin', you couldn't get me outta
I can't lie, I had my first doubts
I thought that you was too pretty for this to work out
I was surprised how this situation turned out
I guess things ain't the way the seem for what it means
Even though we was only younger teens
You always seemed to keep a certain love for me
That's why I'll never know why you set my lovin' free
Tell me if I'm wastin' time
Or does what I'm sayin' register in your mind?
Rememberin' things we used to do
And they keep bringin' me back to you

[Chorus]
She used to be my girl
She used to be mine oh mine
I said that you were my girl
Before you met that other guy
She used to be my girl
She used to be mine
She used to be mine oh mine
I said that you were my girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl
Oh I, oh I, I wish you were here right now, girl

[Verse 2]
I know that this might take some time
But at least tell me what's on your mind
So many heartaches that keep happenin' and you know it
And girl, I hate this feelin' but I can't control it
Shawty, girl, I'm down because you ain't around
Oh well, gone for now, hope you hear this now

[Chorus]
She used to be my girl
She used to be mine oh mine
I said that you were my girl
Before you met that other guy
She used to be my girl, my girl, my girl, my girl

[Outro]
Reminiscin' on them times, babe. Real hip hop, baby. I say all them times thinkin' 'bout it, got me here reminiscin', yeah
