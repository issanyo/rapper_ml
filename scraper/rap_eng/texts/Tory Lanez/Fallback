[Intro]
I like that. I know, I do say shit sometimes and you'll look at me like, "Yo, ahile." Ahile, I'ma tell. It's no lie. Ahile. Hold up. Yeah

[Verse 1]
She bad, ahlie? Ahlie
You should bring a couple friends to the bed tonight, ahlie
She only stuck up when she talkin' to Fargo
Got a nina, but I don't ever gas her though
I just tell her, she got it, she got it, she got it
And I need that, nigga, need that
All up in her ear like the feedback
Gucci, Louis, Prada, you could keep that
It's first class, put your seat back
Look, I need that
The baddest out my city and I mean that
I'ma buy lil mama the new Celin√© bag
I'ma spend 'em commas up on her mean ass
Drama, any nigga fuckin' with lil mama
Tone up, how to fit it, gon' and still gone love her
10 on the Rollie
Zip lock, no tick tock on the Rollie
Nigga still walkin' with the .40

[Bridge]
Still in and out the door like the Fruit Loop
Big money everywhere, young rich nigga in a new coupe
I see the money everyday
I'm talkin' 'bout how I came up just a lil nigga
With this dough everywhere
And I finally got it, they see me and they nodded

[Chorus]
She got it, she got it, she got it
She bad, ahlie, ahlie and I need that
If a man get's that, he'll be glad, ahlie, ahlie and I need that
Girl, put that body in focus, yeah

[Interlude]
Lay down. Nah, I'm not talkin' too fast, you just listenin' too slow, feel me. Fargo

[Verse 2]
And you noticed, girl stay focused
Fuck all that slow shit, I keep it honest
Back in Miami, she see me in Phantom's and now she lay down
And she came dancin' up on me and kept me up
Actin' like she was the motherfuckin' lay down
And you know how they do
You're outta line, you're outta line, you're outta line
And my nigga Pain once said, he say, "You're outta line"
That's why I know you're outta line, lay down

[Bridge]
Still in and out the door like the Fruit Loop
Big money everywhere, young rich nigga in a new coupe
I see the money everyday
Talkin' 'bout how I came up just a lil nigga
With this dough everywhere
And I finally got it, they see me and they nodded, Fargo

[Chorus]
She got it, she got it, she got it
She bad ahlie, ahlie
