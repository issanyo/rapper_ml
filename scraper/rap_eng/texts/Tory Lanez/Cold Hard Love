[Verse 1]
So you took a chance with me
Because you heard I'm cool
So let me show you why what you heard is true
And you're supposed to feel like it's all for you
And this is what we 'bout to do
I dance around my house to your favorite song
It's electrifying when you got my t-shirt on
And I wanna touch but I just stay cool
And this is what we 'bout to do

[Chorus]
It don't take a lot to keep it unpredictable
As long as you let me love your heart and touch your soul
And when you give it up to me, you give your all
Cause all that I give in return is
Cold, hard, hard love
Cold, hard, hard love

[Verse 2]
Put your records on, hot sex all up in the air
Waking up my fingers all up in your hair
Those eyes you do make my world blue
And this is what we 'bout to do
Now take hold of me baby I feel it too
Never been this far from safe but I won't hold you
Cause there's nothing left to hold true

[Chorus]
It don't take a lot to keep it unpredictable
As long as you let me love your heart and touch your soul
And when you give it up to me, you give your all
Cause all that I give in return is
Cold, hard, hard love
Cold, hard, hard love
(Cold, cold, cold, cold)

[Verse 3]
Uh, what if I told you I ain’t know love
And all the chicks I'm with I don't love
Shit still getting harder for me when I'm trying to find it alone
But I know I'm supposed to be grown up
It might be time a nigga owned up for this shit I once did
Games that I once played, shit I once said
No one's turning back on me now
Don’t turn your back on me now
I need you more than ever
You make me wanna put this TV on for the sound
And pull these covers over us and take it slow forever
We go together, we so forever
Put the sunny in the stormy weather
I spent forever trying to figure out how I can fit up in your endeavors
You know I love you like a bow and arrow
Cupid shootin' who he aiming at
Who laying the body down where the statement at?
When love is lost who gonna show you where to claim it at?
You always told me you could show me how to claim it back
Cold hard love, cold hard love
There's nothing in this world that I...
Nothing in this world...
That I know, you
