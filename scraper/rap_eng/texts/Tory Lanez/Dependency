Yeah, uh, it’s for my..., niggas
My... real, niggas
My Canada niggas
It’s the realest shit I ever wrote
It’s the illest shit she’ll ever quote

Uh, I know these niggas love to hate me but fuck it, I’m with it
I’m running the city!
A buck fifty for them bitches were a bucket of fifty
Swiss cheese for some niggas I’m fucking with swiftly
And break bread with all them niggas is hustling with me
I know the feeling I felt it before feeling it
Screw fake city I felt it before grilling it
I grew up fast, too much cash
In the brain of this nigga, that ain’t blew up fast
I send prayers to my mom though, my mind on the dime though
I’mma keep kickin', till I’m looking like Rolando
Stress is my feeling, cause I’m feeling it’s my time though
Knowing I’mma kill it, I’m the illest from my time bro
Time zone, time switch, I get grind, get money and a mind switch
I’m in a mosh pit, with no money, so hungry than a live pit
Before the country I rap it cause it’s my shit
I, guess I'm seeing how you niggas get
If I was on my face, you wouldn’t give a nigga shit
So fuck you all young owe a nigga enough
And everybody’s selling dreams and most of the niggas bluffing
Ain’t gotta brag, and boast a nigga, I’m coming
They know what they’re fucking fear
They show it all in the public
Yeah, but I can see them through my third eye
We gonna be on top, shots watching from the bird’s eye
View from the school, no rules where the birds lie
I was in the basement, trying to get the words out
All the brothers locked up for trying to put some birds out
Million on this case they was trying to bring the herd out
He tried to feed his family, trying to see a Grammy
Working so hard, I ain’t got time to see my family
Niggas on the B role, they’ll be fucking with me
That if I don't make this rapping they go back to selling kilos
You gotta understand that a nigga like me I was raised where
If you got a beef, you throw the hands back
Fuck what your man’s at!
If it’s going down, it’s right now for the hand clap
You down, and you staring back, back to my bullshit
Used to chill with niggas that was strapped with a full clip
Squad up type niggas, started problems over bullshit
But he never caught up, look how he was brought up
Stay up on your feet, cause the closest niggas harm ya
Breaking the alarms up, we was doing bad like there was no such thing as karma
Shout my nigga, that’s the way, he didn’t have no armor
Had my nigga, Big leaning like he was out from....
I can’t see it any further
Lot of single mothers, I ain’t seeing any fathers
She don't see either
Maybe on the weekend, if you see some cooking decent, and
He'll probably call her, and she'll probably spoil him, and
Been rich, went broke, then rich again
With all that I’ve seen and found a lot of missing friends, niggas
That was just pretend, fuck the bails, skip the pen
Riding like District 10, a hundred bands just to spin
Rumor a nigga whispering, what’s a nigga whispering
To a mother fucker that ain’t listening, and bitches just
Jump on a nigga dick, ride it cause a nigga sick
Then the buzz dying, all the mother fucking bitches dip
I don’t give a fuck now, made a nigga numb now
Bitch who’s going dumb, and I’ll never plan the dumb down
I face it, going harder, then it’s bass and its sounds fair
Let the game play and I'll make a goal like a touch down!
I put that on Syriah, I’m on fire
Get a mother fucking grip, nigga bald tire
Fuck these nigga and these bitches, they are all liars
But got niggas and some bitches, nigga bonfires
Yeah, and I'm forever on some fly shit
I’mma draw the line, you niggas pick who you gonna ride with
Shot goes out to Nipsey, I fuck with you for fucking with me
Half of niggas is pussies, you pussy niggas is dickies
Hickies left on my neck from a bitch, I swear that she get me
Me and her both know that she only here for my Benjies
Roldses, Benzes, and Bentleys
Politics couldn't prevent me
So all you niggas resent me for all the hate that you send me
But, it's okay though, I only came up
Sense for the future, back in high school
Teachers called me a looser
Cause she thought that I was focused on banging, soo woopin'
Fuck you for not using
The better side of you and judging the young nigga
With dreams and aspirations for making my funds bigger
Aye, a lot of things I had to figure out
So fake shit don’t ever come about this nigga mouth!

Nigga, Canada! Aha! Live nigga trying to shit on me, it’s all good nigga
I’m about to get mine nigga, when I get it don’t ask me for nothing, nigga
I don’t owe a nigga nothing, nigga
Yeah! And all my niggas back home, we gonna get there in a minute my nigga
We gonna get this money!
