[Verse 1]
Man I fucked every bitch in Toronto
Livest party in my condo
I got Teesha, Deesha and Donna
It's like easter pink in my sauna
Fucked up but I'm still drivin'
Fucked up but I'm still drivin'
Now I'm playin' that she jokin'
Where the fuck is my real driver?
I'm ill droppin', she pill poppin'
They black ballin', I'm still droppin'
And I'm toned up on that rail stop
And the fuck boys never will stop
5'9 and she 5'2
Bad as fuck but she fine too
Fuck is wrong with these hoes, bruh?
My pocket know I'm so fined tuned
And I make a chick, break a chick
Lake down and give her dick
Spendin' the night with your baby like we tryna babysit
Nah nigga, we tryna get at your lady lips
Only hop in and step in and Mercedes whip
Stop, let me get guap
Walk in the room like bitch let me get top
Pay me to fuck me bitch, tell me to guac
We got them bitches a penny a pop
Pennies will pop, then they got drop
Man, I'm on top, nigga damnit, don't stop
God don't know where them blamers gon' pop
I say damn, I wreck it like Hannibal Lector
Back on my solid, this animal settin'
No actin', no anger just hang me to thank
I back off the thing and leave chesses like checkers
The freshesh don't even come check on my checks
It's pay low and I bailout
We'd be talkin', that's pain up
Foreign car, I'm sittin' tall
It's so hard just to lay low
What's wrong with my wrist? Eyeball, eyelids
She calls me cocky 'cause she can't suck my dick
It's too bad I'm too fly, how was your girl? How was your girl?
Two words oh ah, come tell my niggas who's up?
Drinkin' liquor with my niggas
Wifin' down onlike 20 hoes
I know that I might get caught
But shit nigga, there's plenty more
Hennesy, we can get poured up on Hennessy
Roll up and twist in the remedy
Fuckin' with bitches that's 20 that look like they 23
Tellin' you, you don't want me as an enemy, no

[Chorus]
Call it what you want, call this shit a player
She be on it, uh, she fuck with my player
Me, I'm tryna cut, cut, clear
She gon' make them payments if I think she savin'
Then I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck

[Verse 2]
Man, what the fuck's wrong with these hoes, bro?
King shit no cobra
Got a sling clip no shoulder
Strap on a nigga, holster
Back on a nigga, back home
Like post up I'm in a row trap
Ghost ridin;, hittin' four sluts
My nigga Jay shinin' with the gold cuffs
Like G shit, damn nigga, I'm the shit
Caught in it like shark fins, I'm like damn nigga, I'm sea sick
Sea slick on that G shit
I got a whip callin' and my brae slip
Hati'g hard and you ain't my dog
Like why you all on that fleek shit?
G6, paid flights
J's on, plain flights
Cut you late, I hit your dame twice
Man for the frame, I've been the same nights
I'm in a thang tight and what's your name right?
And what's your frame like?
They claimin' I'm drunk drivin'
Get off my dick, I'm in the lane right? Right
Damn it, I'm so on and I'm all on
Got the main light on the main street
In the daylight with my chain bright
I got a dame white, it's all taint rights
And it ain't right but I do it though
Actin' like you got all that bread
It ain't like you, got too much dough
Where you goin' with all that head?
I ain't up for talkin' I know
Shorty like my features so
It's I between them double Ds sort of like Adidas
I got hoes as bad as my features
Plus some .44 for the preachers
These shorties know I got heaters
Clip up on ya hip just like beepers
Chicks put on my dick, just like eat it
All that shit just between them hips
She pillow bite like she teethin'
I get major brain 'til I'm genius, Lord
They ball, chain my double for time
And your bitch here still callin'
I dig her like we ain't got women, see I like women spicy like they cajun
So if I could fuck one word then I'd be fuckin' amazin'

[Chorus]
Call it what you want, call this shit a player
She be on it, uh, she fuck with my player
Me, I'm tryna cut, cut, clear
She gon' make them payments if I think she savin'
Then I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck
I might let her fuck

[Outro]
Come my nigga Jay got dough
Got this block on my wrist
If you're lookin' for your bitch
She on top of our dicks, JJ
This all yours, it's T, nigga, you know what I mean, nigga
That beautiful nigga you talk shit at your funeral, nigga
And fuck wrong with these hoes, bruh?
I meet a bad bitch, I might let her fuck
You know what I'm sayin'?
You can't just fuck me for free
I might let you fuck, baby
Can't just fuck me, bitch
