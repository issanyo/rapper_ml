[Intro]
Uh uh uh
Don't fight it
Pour it pour it pour it
Up up up

[Verse 1: Elhae]
Yeah, uh yeah
Good lord
You're too fine and you know it
Stand right there, just show it
It's getting so hard for me to focus,
Uh, let me get your name
Lights dim low, a little champagne
She don't say much, she been through pain
When she wear a smile, can't complain
That's a lie, I can see that but I need that
And I want you, and you want me
Stop playing girl, I can be that
Uh, one of a thousand
Sipping this wine on an island
Flying all over the world
You know I'm cool with the pilots
Uh, stylin'
Girl let me take you home
I believe you deserve much more
After this last shot we gone
Enjoy the vibe, look me right in my eyes
I see beauty inside
Sip that drink and let's ride

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
We gon' sip this drink until it's finished
Until it's finished, all gone
Baby I got a game and it's called, and it's called
Sip it 'til it's all gone
We been sipping out of this bottle girl
And your body all up on fire girl and I want it
Sip it 'til it's all gone
We gon' drink it all and get tipsy girl
So don't play around and play with me girl
Cause I swear we 'bout to sip it 'til it's all gone

[Verse 2: Elhae]
Uh, oh yeah
Right here when you wake up girl
And you on my mind, you a dime even with no make-up girl
Uh, ooo, that body
You classy but still naughty
Just like I like it
Baby girl don't (don't) fight it
And these hoes ain't got nothing on ya
And I don't do nothing else but spoil you
You a queen so I treat you royal
And in return you stay so loyal
I ain't perfect but you worth it
With a body like that I'm certain
What you want girl, you can have it
Them other niggas all so average
Uh, I'm above that and you love that and I know it (know it)
Hop inside of this whip, you going wherever I'm going
Late nights we back at home
Don't even know what's going on
We sippin' on straight patron and we gone
Yeah

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
We gon' sip this drink until it's finished
Until it's finished, all gone
Baby I got a game and it's called, and it's called
Sip it 'til it's all gone
We been sipping out of this bottle girl
And your body all up on fire girl and I want it
Sip it 'til it's all gone
We gon' drink it all and get tipsy girl
So don't play around and play with me girl
Cause I swear we 'bout to sip it 'til it's all gone
