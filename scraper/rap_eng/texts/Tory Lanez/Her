[Hook : Tory Lanez]
Now do you like girls
Like I do
Ohh I think I fell into something
Cause I won't ever lie to her
Ohh do you like girls
All in the way that I like
Cause it got to be her, gotta be her, gotta be her
Cause it got to be her, gotta be her, gotta be her

[Verse 1 : AD]
Gotta be
I got a question do you like girls
Holla at me I don't bite girl
Cause two is better than one
Best you ever had but I ain't second to none
If I'm jumping the gun just keep it real wit me
But if it sounds like a plan than you can chill wit me
Me plus you, you plus her
Tell me how it feel with me
I ain't gotta say much, i just vibe like this
Give it up, give it up, slide like this
Climb on top, let you ride like this
We can do it all on a night like this
I ain't looking for no love
Straight to the
Girls just wanna have fun
So tell me is you curious
Cause on the real girl I'm serious

[Verse 2 : AD]
I was thinkin bout you
Thinkin bout her
And I gotta have two
Is you cool with it
Cause I know what to do with it
Point her out, point her out
Bring it to me I can show her what I'm bout
If you kiss me girl Imma kiss you back
And if she kiss you
Is you into all that
Look I was just thinkin
We all here for a reason
So stop playing let's go
Don't nobody gotta know
I ain't looking for no love
Straight to the
Girls just wanna have fun
So tell me is you curious
Cause on the real girl I'm serious
