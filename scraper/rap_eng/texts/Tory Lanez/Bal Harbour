[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I swear
All I'm tryna do is hit a lick and put my dogs on
Big time, chuck the money up until it's all gone
Twenty niggas, hunnit chains, bitch we all on
We all on, we all on
We all on, we all on
Someone get the shooters 'cause we all on
I got 40s and the Rugers when we all on
It look like The Godfather, whenever we ball, baby
I'm all up in Bal Harbour, Givenchy and Balmain
It look like The Godfather, whenever we ball, baby
I'm all up in Bal Harbour, Givenchy and Balmain

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Pullin' up
Rolls Royce gave 'em no choice
When I'm tellin' bitches hop in
Rolls Royce gave 'em no voice
Push button and the door close
With a million dollar wardrobe
Airplane mode for the phone
All you fuck niggas, I ignore those
I be up way in the clouds
Cause fuck nigga weighin' me down
I made a full circle with the plane
I call that shit playin' around
I put on the whole clique on bust down
Man the whole world know we up now
Big chain get flood now
Fuck nigga, sit the fuck down
Donâ€™t it make you mad, you see these diamonds on me
Got the whole polar pacific climate on me
All I'm tryna do is put my dog on
Get this money 'til it's all gone

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I swear
All I'm tryna do is hit a lick and put my dogs on
Big time, chuck the money up until it's all gone
Twenty niggas, hunnit chains, bitch we all on
We all on, we all on
We all on, we all on
Someone get the shooters 'cause we all on
I got 40s and the Rugers when we all on
It look like The Godfather, whenever we ball, baby
I'm all up in Bal Harbour, Givenchy and Balmain
It look like The Godfather, whenever we ball, baby
I'm all up in Bal Harbour, Givenchy and Balmain

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
I just fucked your bitch, now she hangin' with the crew
She hopped up in my whip 'cause she know I got the juice
I got a hundred chains, hundred thousand on the jewels
In the foreign switchin' lanes, nigga that's just how we do
Come hop in my ride with me, baby
These dollar signs be drivin' me crazy
She drink about four by 10, shoes, they all Phillip Lim
Girl don't worry bout the cost, them broads don't know about them
I'm gonna be yours someday
I love her, then fuck her like everyday
I'm gonna just cuff and fuck what they say
Getting this cake like Anna Mae
We up in the crib watching anime
Right up in the crib where the phantom stay
Taking all your friends on a dinner date
Why you fuckin' with him? He cannot compete
Diamonds dancing crazy, all my jewelry nae nae
They all on my nuts like a Payday
When I'm up in the club then it's pay day
Put my thumb in her butt she like yeah
In the back of my bus I go yeah
And we finna go up in the air
And I catch a lil' dome in the Lear

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I swear
All I'm tryna do is hit a lick and put my dogs on
Big time, chuck the money up until it's all gone
Twenty niggas, hunnit chains, bitch we all on
We all on, we all on
We all on, we all on
Someone get the shooters 'cause we all on
I got 40s and the rugers when we all on
It look like The Godfather, whenever we ball, baby
I'm all up in Bal Harbour, Givenchy and Balmain
It look like The Godfather, whenever we ball, baby
I'm all up in Bal Harbour, Givenchy and Balmain
