[Intro: Thank Jordan]
I'm on an island right now
Wah, wah, wah
Let's do dis

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Off of work tonight
Damn right
It's a good night
Drug dealer, give me good price (for real)
Damn right
It's a good night

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Hit the lights, get the ice
And the Sprites, lemon limes
Shit lit
Buy a pint
Spend a check, dynamite
How I'm feelin'
Like the man
10 bands
All up in my pants and I'm feeling like the truth
There's the proof
No excuse, ain't no use
I'm just off of work tonight

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Off of work tonight
Damn right
It's a good night
Drug dealer, give me good price (for real)
Damn right
It's a good night
Damn right
It's a, It's a, It's a
Off of work tonight
Damn right
It's a good night
Drug dealer, give me good price (for real)
Damn right
It's a good night

[Verse 2: Thank Jordan]
I drink, I smoke
Hell yeah I do both
All this work I put in, hell yeah I'm gon' toke
Paid the cost to look alive
I'm from where they all go
So, we don't want smoke
We just want the hoes (huh)
Flooded out the Rollie so I shine when I pose (uh-uuuh)
I walk in like I'm Hov (yuh)
I'm a walkin' sto' (yuh)
Boy get your bitch, shawty did me like i'm gold boy
Back to the topic
Ooh, I think I'm popping (huh)
Hop, hop out, we'll rock it (huh)
I'm a walking profit (huh)
Hate don't make you great (huh)
Look boy, stop (huh)
Y'all know how I'm popping (huh)
I'm back off of topic (huh)

[Pre-Chorus: Thank Jordan]
Good night x5, I don't go to sleep
Gesundheit-sundheit(x4), God be blessing me
Bullshit don't be stressing me
That's part of the recipe
Less you walk it how you talk it
You can save your breath from me (walk)

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
Off of work tonight
Damn right
It's a good night
Drug dealer, give me good price (for real)
Damn right
It's a good night
Damn right
It's a, It's a, It's a
Off of work tonight
Damn right
It's a good night
Drug dealer, give me good price (for real)
Damn right
It's a good night
