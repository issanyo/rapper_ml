Hello, it's the fly guy
Money to the sky guy
I could let the 9 color you like some tie-dye
Bars like my wifi
Cars like a drive-by
Even when you tweetin still ain't even on my timeline
I keep it 9
I'm gettin cash, times 9
I like my women real quite like some mines
I'm gettin lost in the money still like find time
For the brain like I'm Einstein
I know what them bitches for
I can make your chick depart
I be hittin hoes you only see on 106 & Park
Funny that them same hoes is always at my crib to talk
If you came here just to talk
Bitch get out my whip and walk
Cause I ain't got time to lose the time on stupid dimes
And take my head and lose my mind
I fucked these hoes two's at times is 3 at 8 and 2 at 9
See I make you feel the blinds like you don't lose your blinds
Baby give me brain and let my dick porous your mind
Get money like social banking

Not love in basketball
Chicks hug and pass my balls
She keep my fucking mouth shut and her ass involved
I love to freaking score

Time is money, I ain't spending time on your chick
