[Intro]
Um, you know when I get my Aston Martin
I'll be in there, seats on recline, bad bitch in the passenger
Spliff burning with Matesa on, you feel me?
Lay back, just cruise

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele & Tory Lanez]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
(1 Verse Killah)
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all (Uh, Canada)
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Tory Lanez]
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the life I can't it let it go (yeah)
Whether that's right I will never know
But here goes nothing

[Verse]
Uh, everybody saying remember me
But where the hell is y'all memories?
I'm searching through walls of my membrane
It's insane, I'm entertainin' the big names
Through diamond, silver lining on my big frames
Niggas stressin' all I'm seeing through the Oakleys
Shit depressin', so we investing to blow trees
Had a dream I was chillin' in the OC
Then I landed out in Cali where they woke me
Discrete mumbles, from summer to street jungle
Voice from my uncle he tell me to keep humble
But at times I slip into deep wonder
Would they show they support in the event that my feet stumble?
See, when you already on, it's harder to say shit
Like the feelin' when you dazed and caught in amazement
Girls gotta stay separate from all of your statements
'Cause for the most part, hoes want a part of the payment
I'm relaxing in the Rolls Royce
Getting money 'cause I give these hoes no choice
I'm all alone in my box, blunt burnin' in the zone with my thots, wait

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
Sometimes a nigga change for the money
Ladies that love me and all of these whips I roll
But buying all the dollars, so why would I holla?
Tryna put my pockets on swole
And I ain't got no time, no-no time (I ain't got no time)
I just got memories, oh no-no, yeah
(And I just got the memories, yeah)

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
Riding to the music, this is how we do it (all night), all night
Breezing down the freeway just me and my baby, in our ride
Just me and my boss, no worries at all
Listening to the Aston Martin Music, Music

[Post-Chorus: Drake & Tory Lanez]
(uh, Mr. Peterson, January 1st, 0-11)
Would've came back for you
I just needed time to do what I had to do
Caught in the...
