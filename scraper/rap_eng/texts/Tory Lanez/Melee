[Intro]
Grrra, head crack
One Umbrella family
We never stop nigga
They'll never stop us

[Hook]
My wrist on Melee
My bitch on bebe
Shit double like the AK
Imma take it on vacay
Find it up in the spot
Give a fuck nigga melee
We get money alot
Half of the niggas hate it
Yea, the fuck niggas hate it
Yea, the fuck niggas hate it
They don't want us to win it
Ain't want us to get it
Yea, fuck niggas say that
Yea, fuck niggas say that
Yea, fuck niggas say that
We get money alot
Living like this is way back

[Verse 1]
I took the cars to the block and my niggas done like "He done did it again"
Imma go up in a Convertible drop in the spot that I hit in the Benz
Clap out that heat from the passenger seat and I had to get rid of the Benz
I did it and did it again
