[Hook: Tory Lanez]

I hop in wraith and I'm repping designer
I'm fucking that pussy it smell like dasani
I'm back in this bitch and you know that we wild'n
Think about where this shit would be without us (x2)

[Verse 1: Creative Gold]

I'm back on my bully
Like Bobby Bobby in a G-Star hoodie
Ball like a rookie, tryna learn the league
Tryna get me some pussy
I8 do tricks for the camera
My whip all that like Amanda
I'm busting a left on Livonia
Once you in foreign's the bitches be on ya
Swerving on Legion & Saratoga
Dancing the coupe it look like it's voguing
Dipping the swag when the doors open
No shirt I be out in my draws posing
She wanna come to my place
I'm a just laugh in her face
I laugh when I ride to the bank
I'm flipping the bird when I hop in the wraith

[Hook: Tory Lanez]

Tony Montana, I step out a foreign
I'm repping designer 
These niggas they hate it
They hate on a nigga designer
Step in Margiela, I'm out in the town
Fucking your bitch, bring her back to the town

[Verse 2: BIGG$]

Hella bitches on my line up, it ain't really hard to find us
Cause I'm dipped in all designer, repping BK like Desiigner
I just thought that I remind them
I got designer, dasani
Yoshi that's all on my body
I cannot help it I'm sorry
Cause every time I walk in I be dressing to kill
I be catching a homi
I was used to running round the lobby
Now I'm tryna pull off in a Mazi
With a couple loud niggas behind me
Need them Hilfigers like Tommy
Then I'm ghost, no Tommy
Cause first you get the money, then the power respect
For designer we gon wild for a check

[Hook: Tory Lanez]

Tony Montana, I step out a foreign
I'm repping designer 
These niggas they hate it
They hate on a nigga designer
Step in Margiela, I'm out in the town
Fucking your bitch, bring her back to the town

I hop in wraith and I'm repping designer
I'm fucking that pussy it smell like dasani
I'm back in this bitch and you know that we wild'n
Think about where this shit would be without us



[Verse 3: Creative Gold]

I'm at it again, they back on my dick
I'm here for the win, 30 for 30
I'm shaking the gym, I'm breaking the rim
Flexing on niggas, Michael Jordan arm
Stretching on niggas
Biscayne with the top down
Bet your girlfriend think a nigga hot now pop out
Rozay hit the floor in the club, blue dot with the ice in the tub
Lil mama see the stunt say what's up
She pulling up tryna fuck tryna rub
I think I see me ex in the cut
Told Johnny go and fill the bitch cup
6 shots of the Henny got me stuck
Everything take time little luck
