[Verse 1: Jake Spooner]
We been on opposite teams since the day that we were born
Same age, same school, same friends but we never got along
You parents always worked late and the same goes for mine
You hated being alone so we'd hang out every night

[Pre-Chorus: Jake Spooner]
As soon as the sun comes up, we act like we're not in love
Doesn't have to be this way but I wouldn't have it any other way
As soon as the sun comes up and you use me like a drug
It doesn't have to be this way but I wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus: Jake Spooner]
We are rivals
We don't speak all day but we love on the weekend
We are rivals
We seem to fight all week but we love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
Love on the weekends

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Love to make love, we used to take drugs on the weekend, you'd come over
Still I been down and still you ain't found a way for us to get closer
Still I been patient, waiting all day, so much like what can I say?
When I promised you I got you on your baddest of your days
She knows how to get physical with me
Have me spending all of my paper for her
She can dance like a stripper for me
Smoke up for me like it's paper for me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jake Spooner]
As soon as the sun comes up, we act like we're not in love
Doesn't have to be this way but I wouldn't have it any other way
As soon as the sun comes up and you use me like a drug
It doesn't have to be this way but I wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus: Jake Spooner]
We are rivals
We don't speak all day but we love on the weekend
We are rivals
We seem to fight all week but we love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
We are rivals
We don't speak all day but we love on the weekend
We are rivals
We seem to fight all week but we love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
Love on the weekends
