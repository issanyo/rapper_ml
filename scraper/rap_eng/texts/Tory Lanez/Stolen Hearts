[Intro]
The house is unusually quiet this evening

[Chorus]
Looking around, and you're no where to be found
Searching high and low, I feel like my eyes go
Anywhere the wind blows
Am I too late to show up?
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
No, my
Stole my heart
Stole my heart, heart

[Verse]
And this is the part where you think you found her but really you never found her
You found out you didn't need her, instead of lovin', you leave her
And wound up cuffin' some 22 year old whose name is Lisa
And found out Lisa don't need you but keep you just for the reason
She couldn't get over Paul who's 20 studyin' law
And gettin; that major paper and pushin' the latest Range
And lately you made a change 'bout how you claimin' your dame
You found out Lisa ain't it and you want that love to remain
But who you came into shit with but fuck it you such a nimwit
You loved her she fuckin' missed it, you lied she upd and listened
Goodbye as you uppedd and kissed him, she tried but you upped and dissed her
So why is the fuckin' question and why is you fuckin' stressin?
You need it back, but she disagree with that
See while you was cheatin', chasin', yeah she was out rereplacin'
Findin' another lover that someone won't keep her waitin'
So she got on the ball, and met this nigga named Paul, who Lisa chasin'

[Chorus]
Oh, yeah yeah yeah yeah
No, my
Stole my heart
Stole my heart, heart
Looking around, and you're no where to be found
Searching high and low, I feel like my eyes go
Anywhere the wind blows
Am I too late to show up?
