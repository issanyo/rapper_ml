I am swimmin' in money
And pullin' yo' chick and I dip it in honey
I'm baggin' them bitches
You niggas is bummy
I know what it is, holdin' it in
Niggas wan' play like "Oh what it is"
Talkin' like "That nigga know what it is"
But when 44 come, that shit don't come
That nigga gon' run
BANG
Get the whole drum
Civic flock yo' lambo
Rock my roca pants low
No, my name ain't Lindsay
But yo' girl gimme low hand (Lohan) though
I got swave like ta-ta
You in the daze like la la
I'm from the T Dot city
Where the city ain't pretty
The niggas gotta deal with the matas like rah-rah
Stand by watch 'em gaze in amazement
I said I'm sick like AIDS in a patient
Ya talk shit get grazed in the basement
It's time for the lave and the swave shit
But no time for the fakes and lame shit
Don't see the whole team go ape shit
Go mad, go dumb, go crazy
So bad, so good, so swavey
Oh baby, I swear I could spit this shit about a million times
I got a billion rhymes, I got a trillion dimes
And I don't even mean women
I mean coins
If we winnin'
Then she joins
But we pass
And she points and says "These boys .. Damn them niggas they be comin' 'round doin' thiiiiisssss"
G5 gon' fly straight to the crib
Boy you know I'm tryna fuck me a stewardess
Baby, you don't need no shots, just take 2 of this
Since I don't make-out, the stuff I do ain't allowed
I'm giving you too much heat
I'm gon' take Bosh, Lebron and Wade out
The fuck ya' niggas talkin'
Ya' still corny with your braids out
I heard yo chick's a killa
Tell her to come and blow my brains out
Oh hold up, I heard snakes in the grass
So I gotta cut the lawn low
And I'm sippin' on a Merlot
And them niggas gon' chat till the 9 on they back like Rondo
Your girls, my girls, my girl, my girls
Oh girl, hi girl, by girl
Lookin' for a white girl
But I'm not Tyga
But you know a Tiger would (Wood) if a tiger could
This a wood shop class, come climb my wood
I got a new whip with designed out hood
And you ain't never in it
The whip like penny
You niggas Pooh, you something like Winnie
And the beat keeps going
And the freaks keep blowin'
And the freaks keep goin'
Till the skeet skeet goin'
In her cheeks she's holdin' it
Ew, I'm sorry ya'll
Had to stop on that line
Almost got in that rhyme
On the top of that line
Huh, use somethin' from the top of my mind
Ah damn, ah shit, goin' outta my mind
And ya not on my time
I'mma shoot her 9 times
With the luger 99
Make the swave go threw her her 9 times
If a man wanna talk that shit like he a big cat, betta have 9 lives
See I said "I don't talk, please let the judge speak"
I'm so ahead of ya'll, I wrote this next week
You said your love strong, but your chest weak
I said you are now flockin' with the best T .. O-R-Y
You ain't never seen no car fly

9 times outta 10
Niggas say you last year
Last year it was your time
This year it's Tory time
Next year is Tory time
Call me father, Maury time
Ya niggas need some more time
Mutha flock ya'll I'm on more grind
So if you don't like me, then mutha fuck you too
Cause I don't give a shit 'bout the fuck you do, nigga
