[Verse 1]
I just wanna tell you, I been missin' you
Sometimes I feel like other guys be dissin' you
And we just don't do the same things we used to
So tonight girl, I'm gonna do something you ain't used to

[Chorus]
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Up against the door
And it will take all night, all night
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Down against the floor
And it will take all night, all night long

[Verse 2]
Baby girl, you're on my mind
Got me spendin' all my time
So after we get done and all the fun is gone
I could be a thousand miles away and still rememberin' our love
So baby girl, take that jacket off
And shawty, ain't no way I'm backin' off
Ain't nothin' that can stop this crazy feelin'
Ain't nothin' that can stop the way I'm feelin'

[Chorus]
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Up against the door
And it will take all night, all night
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Down against the floor
And it will take all night, all night long

[Verse 3]
Just the way you make it whine
You got me spendin' my time
Girl, you do what you do and you do whatever it is that you do to me
Girl, it's you on my mind all the time and I'm never thinkin' 'bout it usually
It be like, oh baby girl
Oh oh baby girl
So after we get done and all the fun is gone
I could be a thousand miles away and still rememberin' our love

[Chorus]
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Up against the door
And it will take all night, all night
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Down against the floor
And it will take all night, all night long
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Up against the door
And it will take all night, all night
Tonight, girl take off your clothes
Down against the floor
And it will take all night, all night long
