[Intro: DJ Drama]
Baby, just give me one
One day and you number one over all them other jawns
Matter of fact, you’d be the only one
Just give me one day

[Chorus]
If you let that ass spend one day with me
You know how this gon' go down when you come over, you know that I'm a freak
Don't you spend one day with me if you ain't 'bout that action
Shawty, if you about that action, show me
Spend one day with me
Are you about it? Spend one day with me
Are you about it? Spend one day with me
You know you spend one day with me

[Verse 1]
I'ma get me out the fuck, I'ma get me out the fuck out the friend zone
I felt her hips then I hope I end up in the end zone
Stay with a group of them girls, but nobody look like her
She leave the crew 'cause she know what I want
Lil mama’s a psychic, yeah, Miami Vice shit, yeah
I’m at the Viceroy, girl, let’s get this night shift, yeah
I got a feeling, yeah, stick with it, talkin' that talk there girl
Soon as you walked in here, all I could think was

[Chorus]
If you let that ass spend one day with me
You know how this gon' go down when you come over, you know that I'm a freak
Don't you spend one day with me if you ain't 'bout that action
Shawty, if you about that action, show me
Spend one day with me
Are you about it? Spend one day with me
Are you about it? Spend one day with me
You know you spend one day with me

[Verse 2]
When I come over, you know that it’s over, you know how I'm gettin' down
I lay your body all over the sofa, you know how I'm gettin' down
Dale que tu puede, all of my Cuban mamis in the buildin'
Super duper, tell the bitch to put the trooper all over my business
Psychic, yeah, she’ll drop a night shift, yeah
Them hoes is sloppy, you know they can't copy even with a right click, yeah
You got a feelin', yeah, droppin' the top on the ceilin', yeah
How can I not when I feel it, yeah? How can you not when you feel the same?

[Hook]
If you let that ass spend one day with me
You know how this gon' go down when you come over, you know that I'm a freak
Don't you spend one day with me if you ain't 'bout that action
Shawty, if you about that action, show me
Spend one day with me
Are you about it? Spend one day with me
Are you about it? Spend one day with me
You know you spend one day with me

[Outro]
You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes, I can tell you wanna fuck
You ain't gotta call me your boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck, I wanna fuck too
You ain't gotta say too much
From the look in your eyes, I can tell you wanna fuck
You ain't gotta call me your boo
Just as bad as you wanna fuck, I want some too
