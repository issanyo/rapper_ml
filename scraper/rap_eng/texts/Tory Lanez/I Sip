[Chorus]
I sip way too much drank
I don't think I can think
I won't try to tell lies
This blunt got me too high
I won't try to pretend
'Cause you and I are just friends
So I won't try to pretend
'Cause you and I just friends

[Verse 1]
After all the nights that we spend
Swear every night too lit
You spend every night with my clique
I just never mind, you're a freak
Telling you it's gettin' too deep
I'm a player, I just crush baby
I'm just out here actin' like a new me
Got this drink up in my cup, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
I smoke, I sip, I drink
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't
Wood grain, top down, switch lanes
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't
That whip, that wrist insane
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't
Cause I smoke, I sip, I drink
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't

[Chorus]
I sip way too much drank
I don't think I can think
I won't try to tell lies
This blunt got me too high
I won't try to pretend
'Cause you and I are just friends
So I won't try to pretend
'Cause you and I just friends

[Verse 2]
You ain't my girl on my slimes
We just slide sometimes
You down to ride sometimes
Rolled up and get high sometimes
Say you love me, but can't touch me
But you know your best friend want me
Is you mad tho?
Can't fuck me
I tell the truth whenever you double cup me

[Pre-Chorus]
I smoke, I sip, I drink
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't
Wood grain, top down, switch lanes
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't
Dat whip, Dat wrist insane
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't
I smoke, I sip, I drink
I'm supposed to stop, but I can't

[Chorus]
I sip way too much drank
I don't think I can think
I won't try to tell lies
This blunt got me too high
I won't try to pretend
'Cause you and I are just friends
So I won't try to pretend
'Cause you and I just friends
I sip way too much drink
I don't think I can think
I won't try to tell lies
This blunt got me too high
I won't try to be pretend
'Cause you and I are just friends
So I won't try to pretend
'Cause you and I just friends

[Outro]
I sip way too much drink
