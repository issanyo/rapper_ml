Hate Me on the Low

[Verse 1]
Lil nigga here but I came from a whole lot
Say I don't give a fuck, if you hatin' nigga, hold up
Man, all of y'all niggas sold out
And I think it's still amazin'
I got niggas fuckin' with me, I know bitches that do too
Yeah, that salt around my city ask them bitches that you knew
I'm gon' always judge a nigga by the bitches that you choose
Yeah, I keep my circle tight, but all them motherfuckers' loose
Two cups full of Henny for some niggas that'll fuck around
With some bad bitches that we couldn't fuck with
Back when we didn't have fast whips and the money around with us all
I know they gon' hate, tell them motherfuckin' niggas, gon' hate it
I tell her give me space 'cause a motherfuckin' nigga so faded
And why the fuck you tryna play me?
Say you fuckin' with me when I know you fuckin' shady
That Kirk on, that whip playin', a little purp blowin', that Swiss chainin'
Niggas hatin' on me, they snakin' on me, I'm just sayin'

[Chorus]
I thought you were my friend, my friend, my friend
It turned out you pretend, pretend, pretend
You hate me on the low
How could you hate me on the low?
And I'm like damn, damn, damn
Ain't no way that you can be my nigga or my friend
You hate me on the low
How could you hate me on the low?

[Verse 2]
Tints all on my Benzo, black tuck in that blue thing
I'm like what the fuck I need friends for?
Always there when I got bread, never around when these heads low
Fuck you when that money come and don't never ask for no cents hoe
It's too much bitches here, too much hoes to fuck
Too much liquor shit, bitch, I'm throwed as fuck
They got so much hate, I got so much love
I can't even fuck with these niggas, no
Old friends, I don't fuck with no more
They be all on my dick and so
Who the fuck is back there? Bunch a fake ass niggas that be trying to act serious
And as lame as that there, treat me different like I wasn't the same as last year
It's plain as black hair, y'all niggas be hatin' in that there
It's some lame shit, I'm tryna get paid like that there
Niggas hatin', I just wanted my change like cashier

[Chorus]
I thought you were my friend, my friend, my friend
It turned out you pretend, pretend, pretend
You hate me on the low
How could you hate me on the low?
And I'm like damn, damn, damn
Ain't no way that you can be my nigga or my friend
You hate me on the low
How could you hate me on the low?

[Outro]
These niggas hate on the low
They wanna snake me for dough
What's mine is mine
These niggas hate on the low
Act like your homie but behind yo back they sow
Pussy niggas hatin'
They hate me on the low
Pussy niggas hatin'
They hate me on the low
Pussy niggas hatin'
They hate me on the low

The Suggestion

[Verse]
Me, I'm just a fly guy lookin' for a lady
Someone better hold me up and drop it over from me
Hope you don't take it wrong, girl, you drivin' a nigga crazy
And I just gotta know, girl
You're fuckin' different
Fuckin' different
Fuckin' different
Fuckin' different
