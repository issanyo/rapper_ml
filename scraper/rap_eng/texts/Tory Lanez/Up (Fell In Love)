[Intro]
I mean it's pain, for real. I mean, I fuck up some times, you fuck up some times. The problem with these niggas is they too busy tryna make it go down. I'm tryna make it go up, like. I mean, you only ridin' with T Lanez on the scene. Most greatest but the most hated. You feel me? Fargo

[Verse 1]
Uh, I'm waitin' for you
Got a couple of women that I could probably call but don't wanna
I been chillin' for a bit, gold diggin' bitch all up on my dick
Now these bitches all on in my washer
Yeah, pressin' all my buttons
Man, I'm pressin up the buttons in my phone, diallin' up on your number
I'm just tryna get right for the night
If you down, let me know, honey
Got a hundred pounds I could blow
Hundred thou' I could throw like it's nothin'
And I heard you like it rough
I can pin ya body down to a wall right now
Girl, know you like that, stop frontin', aw yeah
'Cause I like what you got
Girl, got a attitude, do you bite?
I'm just playin' with you
Tryna lay up like I'm tryna make a layup with you
Let me lay up with you
Let me hit it in the mornin' while you yawnin'
'Til the sunrise in your door then
Tell her sunrise if you goin' in
Like a sunrise, I storm in
I'ma get your body wet, girl stormin'

[Chorus]
I'm tryna go up all night
'Cause the way your body teasin'
Got a nigga tryna leave it up to us all night
When we grindin' it, when your body lookin' find in it
Every time I get all in your walls tonight
I ain't tryna hear excuses, love, this that super love
Let's take you up
Let's take you up
Since I fell in love with your body
I've been all on it, girl and I want it
Since I fell in love with your body
I've been all on it, girl and I want it
Since I fell in love with your body
I've been all on it, girl and I want it
Since I fell in love with your body
I've been all on it, girl and I want it
Since I fell in love with your body
I've been all on it, girl and I want it

[Verse 2]
Uh ridin' in the whip 'cause a nigga 'bout to come to your crib
Sittin' up in theseats, thinkin' me bein' up in your ish
Uh, know you like that, you ain't wanna fight back, wanna do a Mike Jack
Wanna do it, had to book a flight back, girl, when I land, time span, we'll be right to it
It ain't no need for time wastin'
We both got needs and I'm waitin' from what we both want
Everythin's been up and down, it's up and down
And every time I cound around, we fuck around
Shit, are we in fuckin' love or fucked around?
'Cause I just need to know
Every time a nigga in it for the minute, mama get up in it
Now I'm tryna hit it for the moment, now I got this Henny, sippin'
And I'm zonin', and I'm tryna smoke another one
Is you tryna go another one? 'Nother round with it
Real shit, I'm down with it if you down with it
Tryna take it from the ceilin' to the ground with it
Baby girl, I'm a dog with it, you can tell it all when I'm in it

[Chorus]
I'm tryna go up all night
'Cause the way your body teasin'
Got a nigga tryna leave it up to us all night
When we grindin' it, when your body lookin' find in it
Every time I get all in your walls tonight
I ain't tryna hear excuses, love, this that super love
Let's take you up
Let's take you up
Since I fell in love with your body
I've been all on it, girl and I want it
Since I fell in love with your body
I've been all on it, girl and I want it
Since I fell in love with your body
I've been all on it, girl and I want it
