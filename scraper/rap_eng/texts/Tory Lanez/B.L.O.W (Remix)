[Verse: Nasaan]
Aye
I need you quiet on my set like I'm Film Director
I'm the corp executive, I'm the Head-Inspector
I'ma check the check, and check the square ass bitches
Who ain't know I ran it, till they peeped my necklace
Karats on me like I'm Elmer Fudd
And I'm in desperate need of doing some super flexing
And it's just occuring to these weak ass niggas
I been doggin' bitches on my Astro Jetson
In a wabbit coat
Love a hoe? Well thats my decision
I been waiting on it, I been optimistic
I been praying on it, Hoping God Forgive me
Up in Gotham City, Where they robbing niggas
And they Bane the set
Plenty penicillin poppin percocets
Prolly popping pistols
While Young Poppy pocket'd nickels nigga
Tryna put some diamonds where the pressure at:
Around my neck
Payed attention, pastor preached the basics
How I'm on the come up, learning key is patience
From 200 dashed on my bank statement
To 200 dashed tryna street race em
On that "see ya later"
Tried to ease ya favors, Tried to calm ya senses
Tried to make you favorite everything I did
But you was so naive, and I was so complacent
Time & time I go remind myself
That you just put up with me, cuz the pain I painted
Watched you change with my music payments
And my status boostin, and me gettin famous
Couple spins up at the radio
You wanna spend some time, and tryna spend my Franklins
Bitch, you never felt the boy a day in...
Bitch, I bet you that he ain't complaining
Cause Im on a roll
I'm on the ball
I'm on the blogs
I'm on the block
I got you blocked
Plus I'm on my job
You on a jock
And jackin jocks
Ain't never made a single dolla
Ya not my mans, Ya not my dawg
You never called, We never talked
Thats blas√© bla
Plus talk is cheap, and cheap is broad
Your not my brawd, I hit ya raw
Forgot about you, Wait....

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I don't be stressin' these hoes
I just pour liquor for niggas that's it
I don't fuck wit you though
You shitted on me
I can't wait to blow on you
I can't wait to blow on you
I can't wait to blow
I can't wait to blow on you
I can't wait to blow on you
I can't wait to blow
