[Intro]
Swavey
Haha ay yo Jae Fressco
They be askin' why us Canadian niggas say styll
Yeah Canada

[Verse 1]
Ridin', turnin' corners like I'm Sprewell
So much money, I can't even fit my jeans well
Girls love me 'cause my engine is a V12
I'm a boss, ain't gon' tell you all the details
Mememe, ay boy, I'm who your girl tryna like
Mememe, ay boy, you won't see me tryna wife
They wonder who I'm rhymin' like, they bump me like I'm china white
I try to be stuntin' but red and blue colors be clashing and having a diamond fight
Fly talk, fly talk, nigga, it's that fly talk
And I am so fly that I can jump and touch the sidewalk
Platinum in my grill, bitch, listen to when I talk
Haters how you feel, trick? I'm on your girl iPod

[Chorus]
I'm ridin', styll, shining', styll
Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds, styll
I got guala, styll, dolla, bills
Girls love a nigga, wanna holla, styll
I'm ridin', styll, shining in my Rollie
Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds in my Rollie, styll
I got guala, styll, dollar, bills
Girls love a nigga, wanna holla, styll

[Verse 2]
White boy shorts lookin' awesome
Bad blonde chick, I call her Blossom
Rims cripin' with a swan bangin' swanson
Your chick trippin', I'ma kick her out my car again
My buttoned up cardigan look like the start of the hardest shit you ever seen
Meaning I could probably pull all the women in which you have currently been, with
I ain't no one to fib with, why? 'Cause I am a misfit
But I am so swavey that I can say anythin' to you and I can make hits
Ooh, swear I break it down
Bottle rate is goin' up, that's my bank account
Ooh, lemme say it loud
Strong trees, bad broads, lemme break 'em down

[Chorus]
I'm ridin', styll, shining', styll
Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds, styll
I got guala, styll, dolla, bills
Girls love a nigga, wanna holla, styll
I'm ridin', styll, shining in my Rollie
Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds in my Rollie, styll
I got guala, styll, dollar, bills
Girls love a nigga, wanna holla, styll

[Verse 3]
Jewelry game screamin' with the loud bling
Stackin' money 'bout as tall as Yao Ming
Bad girl from the ghetto, that's my wild thing
Car soundin' like my speaker is a loud thing
Fresher than niggas who hating, swavey
Been pressin' the niggas who fakin', swavey
She has to be yours, I done had her before
I'm not impressed with the chick you datin'

[Interlude]
No no no, that is not swavey
Your girl is definitely, anti-swave
Anti-swave

[Verse 4]
My girls are Bajan or Asian persuasion or maybe she's even Jamaican
I skeet on your women and sleep on you niggas like I live life in a vacation
Bangin' 'cause I'm wildin', Asian chick from Shaolin
Bank account is so big, that I could fit your child in
Bank cards I'm swipin', bad broads I'm pipin'
Tongue here and it's fun here, I'm too young here to be wifin'
You can be the star, Tory is the centrefold
And I just hit your broad, now she open like an envelope
I'm sick with no antidote and uh, why you in her for?
Whip game fruity, it be lookin' like some cantaloupe

[Chorus]
I'm ridin', styll, shining', styll
Your girl on my dick, she love my diamonds, styll
I got guala, styll, dolla, bills
Girls love a nigga, wanna holla, styll

[Outro]
'Bout 10 seconds of talkin' that good ish and I'ma talk that good ish right styll. Time is money styll. Everybody know we in the buildin' styll. I'm with your girl styll and I got her in my knapsack styll. I ain't even gotta front though. What up Jae Fresco? Exclusive swave
