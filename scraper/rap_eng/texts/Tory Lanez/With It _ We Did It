With It

[Verse 1]
Shawty, you don't understand me
I'll buy that ticket and fly yo ass straight to Miami
You always, you always got it
You always, you always got it
And I'm just, I'm just, I'm keepin' it real
'Cause you know that this shit, wait
'Cause you know that this shit real
Young nigga, big deal
See me ridin' in a drop top
Lil nigga, big wheels
And she fuckin' with it
You know that this shit real
It's a big deal
And Fargo be ridin' around lookin' for what you got
So just say oh with it

[Chorus]
When the drinks all gone and the weeds all done
And all you got is me and all you got is, say oh with it
When the drinks all gone and the weeds all done
And all you got is me and all you got is, say oh with it
Say oh with it, say oh with it, say oh with it
Say oh with it, say oh with it, say oh with it
Say oh
Say oh with it

[Bridge]
You always, you always got it
You always, you always got it
You always, you always got it

[Chorus]
When the drinks all gone and the weeds all done
And all you got is me and all you got is, say oh with it
When the drinks all gone and the weeds all done
And all you got is me and all you got is, say oh with it
Say oh with it, say oh with it, say oh with it
Say oh with it, say oh with it, say oh with it
Say oh
Say oh with it

We Did It

[Verse]
We did it
We did it, at the Marquis, under your sheets, up in your suite
We did it yeah, like a ball player, on them floor seats
Let me be your inspiration, yes when I'm tipsy, baby
Ooh I'm so tempted baby, but you like that don't you?
Hot in here with ventilation
Got you here, there ainâ€™t no waitin'
Stop right there, now let me face ya
But you like that don't you?
Girl, I'm all for it
All I ask of you is take it off for me
I got a lot to give, take it off for me
Let me fall for you, you could fall for me
Yeah, oh no no
We did it yeah, yeah
Oh no no
We did it yeah, yeah
