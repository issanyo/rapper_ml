Ooo you gettin' off work late, but it's okay

To get them ready cause you get...
So many Indica, so much endo smoke
It's hard to breathe
You don't get this turnt, oh not usually

[Refrain]
I just landed in M.I.A
And she just fuckin' up a check
Got a nigga she don't got to sweat
It's sad I know, I gotta say

From LA I gotta leave now
Just let me pop it 'fore I gotta jet
Girl, you got somethin' I just gotta get

[Verse 2]
Ooo you always get me lit, that late, late night

So many Indica, so much endo smoke

Said I got this feelin', and this shit feel great
So fuck what they say

[Refrain]
I just landed in M.I.A
And she just fuckin' up a check
Got a nigga she don't got to sweat
It's sad I know, I gotta say
I'm bleeping out, I hit the beach now
From LA I gotta leave now
Just let me pop it 'fore I gotta jet
Girl, you got somethin' I just gotta get

[Bridge]
I can't just let you go
You're all that's on my mind
I wasted time, I know
Wish I could just rewind
While I was gone you left
Gone away for good
Least you could'a done was let me know
Guess I'm misunderstood
This time I waited too long
This time my feeling's too strong
Anticipated too long
There's only one thing I want

[Hook]
I wanna get them draws from ya
Tonight I'm goin' hard for ya
Tonight she takin' all of me yeah
Fargo
I wanna get them draws from ya
Speedin' from the law for ya
We fuck like friends with benefits
