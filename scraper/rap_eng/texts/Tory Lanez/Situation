[Verse 1]
Ay girl, I know it's been a long while since we last talked
It's been about a couple years now, we been away too long
I wish that I could pick it up, from where we left off
Now girl, I know it ain't the same now, I heard you got a man
But look at what you look like, girl, you don't understand

[Chorus]
If we get caught up in the mood, crack a bottle of the Rosé
Would you wanna be my boo? Would you wanna be my shawty?
What if we go out, do all your favourite things
Everything's alright, tell me do you think this could be
A situation, situation

[Verse 2]
Uh, seems rain is the weather
Know the situation ain't makin' things better
But nowadays, shawty duckin' under pressure
'Cause it seems conversations full of fuck it and whatevers
Still she love me, it's a blessing
Still she got another lover and she love when they together
But fuck it, it's whatever
'Cause we ought to get to touchin', you don't know what do next
A situation come usually
But she ain't love the man her man used to be
I just wanna see it truthfully
I just wanna see it truthfully
I just wanna see it truthfully
I just wanna see it truthfully
The situation is serious, had to break it down
Let's lay under the summer, lemme break you down
Muai tai dinners, you penners with cubes in 'em
Religion True denims that match mine, you damn fly
Look you better than Miss Curly Sue
I would cop you the ring, rocky pearly blue
Baby, we can be a match, that'll surely do
With my fly stacks and curvey you
Just hit me in the early now

[Chorus]
If we get caught up in the mood, crack a bottle of the Rosé
Would you wanna be my boo? Would you wanna be my shawty?
What if we go out, do all your favourite things
Everything's alright, tell me do you think this could be
A situation, situation

[Bridge]
Now baby, what if we go out
What if we do your things
Like everything's alright
Tell baby, do you think
Now baby, what if we go out
What if we do your things
Like everything's alright
Tell baby, do you think

[Chorus]
What if we go out, do all your favourite things
Everything's alright, tell me do you think this could be
A situation, situation

[Outro]
Listen baby, I know you with him and all, but you need to be with me. I could treat you way, way better. I know you like that. So let it be a situation, baby
