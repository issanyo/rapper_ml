[Verse 1: Nick Carter Green]
So the fact is
Girl, I’m in love with your assets
Ass is so fat that its got its on axis
Access
Well, can I get excess
Actually can we make fools of your exes
Past tense
And that mean whatever you want it to mean
Hood shorty
So she loving them mean
Good girl
So she tell me to clean up
Whenever we be hitting the scene
Cause he ain’t what he seem
Now a nigga mad cause he ain’t with the queen
Had to leave him to come fuck with a king
Like T’Challa, right?
You was missing in the winter
Got your stomach right
So ain’t no listening to no nigga
This your summer, right?
Saw you picking from a distance
Told your girlfriends I can get it
So we fucking right now

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get lit
I do that for me
Thinking how you only did for you
Never thought about me

[Bridge: Nick Carter Green]
Girl, you shining like you 18
And I’m just trying to find my way about it
And now you got me feeling thirsty
Them thighs are leading to your water fountain
I don’t know what to say to you
So I can stay with you
Cause I can’t play with you
When you know I’ll say

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Roll up, drink it
I do that for me
Pour up, get lit
I do that for me
Thinking how you only did for you
Never thought about me

[Refrain: Nick Carter Green]
Girl, you shining like you 18

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
I hate to say I feel this way about you
Situations, you can't stay up out them
I guess there's nothing left to say about it
