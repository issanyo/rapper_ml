[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Brand new Givenchy it look like the linen from Rome
We got that A1 Perico the shit for the low
We whippin' Rihanna oh baby, Rihanna oh baby
Only designer I'm makin', the trap it go crazy
That A1 Perico, I got that A1 Perico
That A1 Perico, I got that A1 Perico
Hit the club and spendin' c notes
And I'm stuntin' all on these hoes
Niggas frontin' on the squad though
But we got that A1 Perico

[Verse 1: MistaRogers]
Stuck to the g code when it came to snitchin' all my niggas kept it tighter than a peephole
How the fuck you think he gettin' money I don heard he was hungry but I never seen that nigga in the streets though
When you was pissin' in the beds I was layin' in the feds
Distribution of the A1 Perico
But I still take the motherfuckin' pack
And I wrap it up two times shoot it like a free throw
I need a house on the hill, Wraith in the garage
Couple bad bitches and they down for the menage
Ex convict but I still beat the odds
Ballin' like a motherfucker still livin' large
Hey pay attention to the shit that I say
I hustle hard I been grindin' all day
Mind on the money been stackin' since May
And you know I go all out for the play

[Verse 2]
I kick it like Messi you don't wanna test me my nigga I'm A1
The feds had arrest me my friends they all left me except for my day ones
Ain't no tellin' what could happen if you try to fuck with the squad
Put a hole in your head when it come to this bread and I put that on God
Whip whip whippin' Rihanna you know that's them bricks and they come from Barbados
Going crazy for the commas it look like a sack of potatoes
Don't know what you would do
Got 6 figures in back of the Subaru
Nigga I make it shake like a hula hoop
Brown narcotics on top of my cuticles
And you know what them dudes and them shooters do
