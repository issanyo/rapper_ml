[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Dipset, a'ight

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Throw it back for me if you bad and you know it
I’ma keep it real, shorty bad and she show it
You can do it fast, baby, just don't go too fast on me
I can't get no sleep
I been up for the whole damn week
I can’t get no sleep
I got a super bad bitch on me

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
She said she want the bottle, so I bought the case (Rose)
You know I beat it up like I caught a case (Beat it)
Fucked her for a couple days, first forty-eight (Hours)
Uh-oh, I think I left a trace on her face (Ayy)
I can't get no sleep 'cause she all on me (She all on me)
It's like we never done, she got me on repeat ('Peat)
She throw it all on me, she say it's all for me (For me)
She say she in love with me but she just love the D (D)
I get her so wet it's spillin' like she peed (Dang)
We keep fuckin’ up the sheets, can’t get enough of me (Ayy)
She won't let me leave, she ain’t tryna go (No)
But that money callin' so I gotta go (Go, go)
She like, "Can I go?"
She like, "Can I roll?" (Damn)
She like, "Can I fuck you on the way to get the dough?" (Damn)
She know I'm a dog but she love my bone (Love my bone)
Come into the money while she cummin', that’s two in a row

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I can't get no sleep
I been up for the whole damn week
I can't get no sleep
I got a super bad bitch on me
Throw it back for me if you bad and you know it
I'ma keep it real, shorty bad and she show it
You can do it fast, baby, just don't go too fast on me

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Uh, Capo
She said she want a bottle, so I brought the case (Roses)
You know I beat it up like I caught a case (I'm guilty)
Fucked her for a couple days, first forty-eight (Grr)
Killed that bitch up in the tele like I'm Norman Bates (Spooky)
All she saw was rocks in the Audi face (Clean)
I'm spillin' paint on my chain while I pour the Ace (Chill)
She thought she was in space when she saw the Wraith (Ahh)
I got a lot of rich habits and make poor mistakes (Work)
She was on her 'Gram workin' on her angles
Tried to catch me on the Snap, she tryna get me tangled (Silly)
Got a lot of whips and chains like this nigga's Django (Hear me)
I made that pussy raw like that bitch a Bengal (Grr)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I can't get no sleep (No sleep)
I been up for the whole damn week
I can't get no sleep
I got a super bad bitch on me
Throw it back for me if you bad and you know it
I'ma keep it real, shorty bad and she show it
You can do it fast, baby, just don't go too fast on me
