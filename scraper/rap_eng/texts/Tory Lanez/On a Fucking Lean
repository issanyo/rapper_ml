[Intro]
I'm leanin'
You don't even know

[Chorus]
I'm leanin'
Rollin', zonin'
Tell me you don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it
Sippin' on somethin' strong
And you don't wanna even know
Sippin' on somethin' strong
When I got nothin' to lean up on
Sippin' on somethin' strong

[Verse]
I'm paint fallin', my place stalln'
They in the whip, they hatin' on me
They say they love me, they snakin' on me
They outside, they waitin' on me
Aw yeah, I'm ready
Smokin' up and I'm steady smokin'
They holdin' down on it, posed to hold me up
Ballin' niggas so heavy
And I'm ridin' clean, hoes outta me
But they tell the truth to them niggas
Fuck y'all, I'm 'bout to fuck y'all
I'm glidin' through with my niggas
I got cash to fuck
With a ass like that, I have to fuck
Oh oh, now let me come down, ooh, I'm dippin'
We takin' shots tonight, Scotty Pippen
It's this bitch, call me Pippen in this bitch, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm leanin'
Rollin', zonin'
Tell me you don't mean it
You don't mean it, you don't mean it
Sippin' on somethin' strong
And you don't wanna even know
Sippin' on somethin' strong
When I got nothin' to lean up on
Sippin' on somethin' strong
