[Hook: Tory Lanez]
They hate when I walk in the building
Pussy niggas don't affect me
I got this money, so as long as I stack it, ?
To them niggas who thought we were finished, to them bitches who thought we were finished
Well I guess it's just me, guess it's just me and my millions
Niggas thought we were finished, man fuck all of you niggas
I guess it's just me, I guess it's just me, me and all of my millions
Bitches thought I was finished, man, fuck all of you bitches
I guess it's just me, I guess it's just me, me and all of my millions

[Verse 1: Trav]
I be having millionair nightmares, feeling like the ? right there
Wake up and get them like right there
Yeah, I done payed all my doos
Had a ? 62
I done sold a brick or two
I done hit a lick or two
Niggas know I'm making moves
Tom Crues with the Uzi
Niggas talkin, Imma proove it
They counted me out, they counted me out
They counted me out
They?
Stated? they want me?
They didn't want me to win
These bitches want all of my money, they can't get nothing from me

[Verse 2: Trav]
Ten pidgens on the boat, I ain't talking Yachty
Still? my body
When I fuck m, call me daddy
When I fuck m, call me poppy
Sware to god I can't lose
I always make the right moves, I always make the right moves
Hundred K for the shoes
Just in case they gotta shoot?
Trapper, rapper and a shooter
Won't hesitate to do ya
Just made a mill off a duffle
Ain't told ?
Money might haunt you
They didn't want me to win, these bitches want all of my money
You cannot get nothing from me
