[Intro]
I got it in the worst way
Got me trapped in your love cage
Listen, listen
Your eyes don't glisten, glisten
Like they used to
And this ain't something that I'm used to, no

[Verse 1]
Uh, I landed in Miami with the top
Tryin' spend a lil time with a bad one
I got a lil motto, any bitch that you fuck
Make her badder than the last one
I'm pullin' in a S50, pullin' in a fuckin' S50, shawty
Stuntin' in a S50, stuntin' in a fuckin' S50

[Bridge]
Like oohwee, who's he?
These niggas is talkin' and if they don't like it, sue me
I'm too deep, I'm too deep
But not with my niggas, with two freaks, yeah

[Chorus]
Look I need somebody
So do you want to be somebody, yeah?
I'm tryna see some shawty
That's what you need to do to be down for it, ah
Initiation, initiation
Initiation, initiation
You wanna get down with a nigga, you gotta be patient
Initiation, initiation

[Interlude]
I know the way you operate
It's much easier than falling again
I know you won't cooperate
But I know far too much to buckle now

[Verse 2]
Pullin' up the cameo in Miami
She steppin' out the Maserati eyein' at me
I'm pourin' up, I'm with a Dirty Diana
Shawty get it poppin', shawty called Keiyanna
Okay, well okay
I heard you goin' both ways, you don't say
I know your friends tryna do it off a Dolce
And when I’m walking' in she acting out a role play

[Bridge]
Like oohwee, who's he?
These niggas is talkin' and if they don't like it, sue me
I'm too deep, I'm too deep
But not with my niggas, with two freaks, yeah

[Chorus]
Look I need somebody
So do you want to be somebody, yeah?
I'm tryna see some shawty
That's what you need to do to be down for it, ah
Initiation, initiation
Initiation, initiation
You wanna get down with a nigga, you gotta be patient
Initiation, initiation

[Interlude]
I know the way you operate
It's much easier than falling again
I know you won't cooperate
But I know far too much to buckle now

[Verse 3]
She hopped off the plane and she said her name
I wanna get ya, bitch, I wanna tame
Baby, you know you a piece for the P, nigga
One Umbrell, mad love, it's so hard to compete with us
Hop in the rari', I hijack the streets nigga
I'm all in the trap house, I'm duckin' the Dee's with her
I work out the work and she workin' for me, nigga
She'll do anything for some new Céline
All on the highway, all on the highway
My whip be smokey like it's from Friday
This shit amazin', this feel amazin', yeah
Grills in my mouth and I fucked her with Bathing Ape on
Holla at a real nigga shawty 'cause I know you need somebody
I'm not soundin' too insane, insane, insane
Hope what I'm sayin' don't sound insane, insane, insane
