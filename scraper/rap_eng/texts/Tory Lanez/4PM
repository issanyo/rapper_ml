[Verse]
Yeah, okay
All my young boys is shooting, they with the shootouts
One Umbrella crew out, nigga what you gon' do bout
My dog Jae say he just tryna find him a new route
I'm tryna do me the same, my bitches do be insane
Got that Mulsuanne glidin', I'm riding it
Through the rain, through the pain
We do change, niggas won't do a thing
And me, I do thangs, nigga, hot like blue flame
And my wrist saying, "bitch, come kick it" like Liu Kang
Look, nigga I don't play no games, I'm a general
Lifetime ties, I ain't fucking with the federal
White wine vibe, 5 bitches on my genitals
I pedal to the metal, she don't put me on a pedestal
I hit her with the finishing touch
I diminish them bad bitches and hit em' like a cinnamon dutch
I touch bad bitches with mad riches, they dad riches
And I'm in they back so much nigga I'm ad-libbin'
Big timer, dough proper, show stopper
Bad bitches, actresses in soap operas
Getting so much dough, ya'll niggas owe papa
I get paid to put you on a stretcher, old doctor
We be moving militant, whole squad real and shit
10 rollies, 30 chains, whole squad killin' shit
Went to Rolls Royce, drove the Wraith out the dealership
Bought the shit cash, you can tell em' that I'm still legit
Y'all say y'all ball with payments to make
On the G4 cigar with plane flicks to take
G5 private plane away from jakes
Yeah, nigga, I do lear from state to state
Gotta yellow presidenti and I baked the face
My chick yellow den confetti, got her laced in grape
Treat my dates like, "fuck it, if we late, we late"
And if you fucking and you saying you relate, we great
Okay, why them niggas hating on Tory, can't chance it
Why they all sick of my face, that's cancer
Why they in the backroom dissing like the dancers
Well, me and Sway are the same cause we don't got the answers
I was with the scammers, trigger pullers and jammers
Night time shooters will do you in they pajamas
Then eat Oodles and Noodles and go to sleep vampin'
Toss hammers in water and lay in East Hampton
Me, Sosa, and Brooks, that's the three champions
Give your bitch a 3 point foul, 3 chances
Your bitch say I'm lying, I ain't fucking, she dancin'
I knew she was fucking from the first 3 glances
Heard she gotta twin that heard I ball, Steve Francis
Fuck her and then I'm taking her sis, Steve Nash shit
Relax nigga, I'm on my relapse nigga
And I already won the race, these just re-laps nigga
Mind your bitch and your bees wax nigga
I keep 3 straps cause we done hit some cats that's gone be back, nigga
After the Wraith Wraith talk, the "Wah gwaan, Popcaan?"
I'm still with real niggas saying, "Wah pop? Wah gwaan?"
Pull in something foreign with the top all chopped on
Niggas knocking lights, clap on, clap on
Bedsheets top on, Ralph Lauren I'm killing it
Linen all out there touring with foreign models
More bottles ordered, them bitches is gon' swallow
And I swear I got so many hollow tips, I'm going hollow
If I aim, shoot, bang, my nigga, it's gon' follow
When that shit is full throttle, I drink the full bottle
Of Patron, when it's on my nigga then it's on
So I'm gone, ready to kill 'em niggas, gon' feel 'em
And I made your bitch pay, ain't nobody gon' bill 'em
And I'm good in the Chi, ain't nobody gon' drill 'em
And my goons going gorilla, my niggas cold killas
August 19th, you niggas is gon' feel us
Know it's gon' pop, know this shit is gon' pop
Pop up and make another mil' and call that going pop, nigga
Yeah, and you know you gon' flop, nigga
Uh, and all you haters gon' drop, niggas
Uh, and you know I'm on my [?]
All you niggas mighty gon' duck like Bombay
Big time killer, big time seller
