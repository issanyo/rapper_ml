[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Girl you know I got it
And I know you want some more
See me in lobby
I might hit it on your floor
And I'm getting high
While you getting low 
And I'm getting high
While you getting low 
Do you want some?
Want some more
Want some more
Want some more
Do you want some?
Want some more
Want some more
Want some more
Do you want some?

[Verse 1: Shotty Horroh]
I know that she wants some more
Oh yeah, she greedy for sure
I let her work with the work
She took care of the PAC like Afeni Shakur
She said she seen me on tour
She said she heard me with Tory
She said she wants me to pull up 'cause she's home alone like Macaulay
'Cause I've got that something she's begging for
I'm the reason that she goes for pedicures
I've been boning your bitch: call me Skeletor
She got lower than you with your credit score
Fuck are you begging for?
Okay, she's on man
Keep it jiggy, that woman was never yours
Told her I'm staying up on the 7th floor
She can come up and link me whenever or I'll come and check her more
I know she's on me, 'cause she follows me round like a zombie
'Cause she follows me 'round like The Walking Dead
I think she's tryna keep me and lock me
I mean, she's always on my line talking "Reh teh teh.."
I'm like "Oh, OK, seen, OK, yeh yeh yeh..."


[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Girl you know I got it
And I know you want some more
See me in lobby
I might hit it on your floor
And I'm getting high
While you getting low 
And I'm getting high
While you getting low 
Do you want some?
Want some more
Want some more
Want some more
Do you want some?
Want some more
Want some more
Want some more
Do you want some?

[Verse 2: Shotty Horroh]
She knows I've got it, so she's gotta have it
I see her fiending like I was her habit
She wants some more, she's just an addict
If I give her D, then it's kinda like trapping, yeah
And I got the best product on the market, so she wants to come see the plug
I told her I'm too fussy
Just give me pussy, you can keep the love
I'm S.H., make your girlfriend say that she wants more
I said I can't stay 'cause I'm on tour, in a place where they say "Bonjour"
I'm in the Hilton based on the top floor
Flexing, spending P with my bredrins
She's in the club with her best friend
Tryna get man to pull up and check them

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Girl you know I got it
And I know you want some more
See me in lobby
I might hit it on your floor
And I'm getting high
While you getting low 
And I'm getting high
While you getting low 
Do you want some?
Want some more
Want some more
Want some more
Do you want some?
Want some more
Want some more
Want some more
Do you want some?
