[Pre-Chorus: Willie X.O.]
From the scale of one to ten, girl, I could give you ten
Used to be a player but, girl, that was back then
From the scale of one to ten, girl, I could give you ten
Used to be a player but, girl, that was back then

[Chorus: Willie X.O.]
Let me just comfort you
All I wanna do is be a comfort to you
Let me just comfort you
All I wanna do is be a comfort to you

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
On a scale from one to ten
You gettin' straight tens across the board again
Sexy and text me, and still got that O again
I need it all again, need it all again
'Cause you got that thing I like
You got that thing I need
You got that thing I like
And you got me, you got me, you got me

[Pre-Chorus: Willie X.O.]
From the scale of one to ten, girl, I could give you ten
Used to be a player but, girl, that was back then
From the scale of one to ten, girl, I could give you ten
Used to be a player but, girl, that was back then

[Chorus: Willie X.O.]
Let me just comfort you
All I wanna do is be a comfort to you
Let me just comfort you
All I wanna do is be a comfort to you

[Verse 2: Popcaan]

Feeling right when you touch my zone
Baby girl, you're the best I've known
Turn me on anytime like a new iPhone

Bumpa big, me call you fi mi Nicki Minaj
Give you everything, baby, no bother ask
Gyal, you gone with mi heart

[Pre-Chorus: Willie X.O.]
From the scale of one to ten, girl, I could give you ten
Used to be a player but, girl, that was back then
From the scale of one to ten, girl, I could give you ten
Used to be a player but, girl, that was back then

[Chorus: Willie X.O.]
Let me just comfort you
All I wanna do is be a comfort to you
Let me just comfort you
All I wanna do is be a comfort to you

[Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus: Willie X.O.]
From the scale of one to ten, girl, I could give you ten
Used to be a player but, girl, that was back then
From the scale of one to ten, girl, I could give you ten
Used to be a player but, girl, that was back then

[Chorus: Willie X.O.]
Let me just comfort you
All I wanna do is be a comfort to you
Let me just comfort you
