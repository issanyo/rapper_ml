[Verse 1]
I, I, I remember them streets so well
I, I, I remember them people well
Them, them, them, them same niggas
Walk around and be tellin' everybody I changed nigga
I know that you only wanna fuck with me 'cause I hope you get
You say you want the old me 'cause the old me nigga was broke as shit
That's what you want huh? That's what you want huh?
Just gon' and say it to my face, my nigga, don't lie
Lately niggas been fakin', no blow but a nigga's been patient
Low blows, niggas just hatin', oh no
They just want to mess around and turn me to the nigga I used to be
Chillin' with the girls that I used to see
And all them same girls wanna keep it real with everybody else
And never want to tell the truth to me
But on the outside I'm a cool ass nigga
Y'all can't see all the pain nigga hold
Y'all can't see all the pain nigga show
Sittin' back watchin' all these lame niggas blow
But uh, don't trip 'cause I know a nigga time comin'
I be waitin' on the shit like a ride comin'
But right now I got to sit it on the side youngin'
Don't worry, I'ma get it, I get it
The fam like, "Nigga, admit it ya did it" and I be like, "Nigga, I ain't did shit"
Mind on the big shit, time for the big shit
I been on the grind so long, it's ridiculous
But niggas gon' doubt, well tell 'em wake there ass and see
I promise ya'll it's gon' happen for me!

[Chorus]
I can't let you haters be my stress
Even though y'all done me all wrong
When they gon' cut me my check
Haters I remember all y'all, haters I remember all y'all

[Verse 2]
I, I, I used to walk around free
I, I know that you often doubt me
I, I can't help but feel the pain
Some nights nigga needed sun light but I really can't help but feel the rain
My gift, God given, hard liquor for hard livin'
My bluntness, pardon it, got a dream, gon' get it
Nigga, I'm never gon' go, let you niggas get used to me
Nigga, I'm feelin' so low that a nigga need a booster seat
I still feel like a bet he gon' get 'em
I'm in the studio like 24/7
I be on the move, plenty momentum
I ain't got room for any more venom
For you snakes and shit, the fakes in shit
It just makes me sick
This is not the motherfuckin' life a nigga signed up for
Lookin' at it like this can't be it
Damn, what a real nigga gots to do
To get a condo with a private view?
'Cause I be in the game lookin' at the superstars like
Everythin' you doin' nigga, I can do
So how could you be so arrogant, some of y'all people?
Walk around here like ya runnin' our people
And they talk like everyone is our equal
Y'all niggas fake, everyone of y'all see through

[Chorus]
I can't let you haters be my stress
Even though y'all done me all wrong
When they gon' cut me my check
Haters I remember all y'all, haters I remember all y'all
