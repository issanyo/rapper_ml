Turn you into a freak baby
Nothing for them to see in here baby
Hoody on slim shady
10/10 is what you rated
I just, keep it, clutch
You know what, sup
I run it, up
Make ya, jump
Next to you is where I wanna be
Catch a flight and have fun with me
Any freak on Facebook just say it
If you want you can get it  just saying
Too many games but you should know I ain't playing
Any thing then you should know that Iâ€™ll pay it 
Bang wit me then you bang wit her cuz that's my baby
Never fold cuz I got a bunch of aces

And here it, goes
Goes, goes, goes
Watch me, go
Watch it, go

Talk to me baby
Turn you into fiend
With a some of JC
Talk to me baby
I just hopped out the car
We can go until tomorrow
And just
Get a little wavy
Turn you into a fiend
With some JC
Talk to me baby
I just hopped out the car
We can go until tomorrow
And just
