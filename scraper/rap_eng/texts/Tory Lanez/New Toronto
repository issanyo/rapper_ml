[Verse]
Thumbin' through this check, I'm 'bout to violate
My swag be fuckin' up the tri-state
I might confront you niggas, nah please
Bitch I move it spicy with that I A (hi daddy)
A nigga pulled up in a i8
Wavin' at you niggas like, "Hi hater"
My bitches love to ball, Sanaa Lathan
This that New Toronto, keep the driver waiting
Yeah, thank the Lord, I'm takin' charge
How can I forget when niggas made a star?
Smokin' in this whip Iâ€‹ bought for 80 large
I am rich bitch, I could buy 80 cars
Triple goose, I'm feathered in it
My bitches silly, your bitches look whatever in it
Lift up the doors, got me feather weighted
Never say never, but pussy, my shit never endin'
When my momma died, they gave me Halmark's
I told myself, I get a crib as big as Walmart
I spit the days aimin', pointin' like a war dart
Now I spent the day, grace the stage at the ball park
We don't resort to violence, just resorts and islands
Book you nigga's for a show, get you scorched and silenced
Ironically, my keys got a horse and my whip visa Porsche
And I am hoppin' out the doors for stallions
Way before my lifestyle was marvellous
Could crack the code but it's back to that boulevard with us
When it was dark taxi cab will never stop with us
Non stop, four money, four blocks
I juiced and stressed, sellin' for four blocks
Pop found a four in my dresser, phone rock
Now I stressed, the compresser is still oppressive
Got me stuntin' on my exes
Short and sick, spent a couple hundred on my dresser
Said fuck that, left a couple hundred for my dresser
There's a war goin' on outside and we got pressure
So I ride with the strap, no joker, Heath Ledger

For Scarborough, Sauga City, Brampton

Thumbin' through the check I'm about to violate (gangsta)
My swag be fuckin' up the tri-state
Shout out to Jane & Finch
I might confront you nigga's, nah please
Bitch, I move it spicy with that I A, hi daddy
My Rexdale niggas
A nigga pulled up in a i8
Wavin' at you niggas like, "Hi hater"
My bitches love to ball, so now I laid it
This that New Toronto, keeper drive away (New Toronto)
