[Intro]
This just in, we found your bitch
She's in my knapsack, yeah
I was lookin' around my knapsack, man
And like I seen all the regular hoes right
But then, I think, I think I seen your bitch

[Verse 1]
I tell her, "Bitch, chill, ride like a big wheel"
Big deal, put a mill on a fish scale
Niggas hatin' 'cause the way the paper makin'
But baby, I'm Canadian, so I'm bringin' home the bacon
They ain't see me in a long minute
I'm gon' get it, you fake and I'm authentic
Bitch, I got it from the low, no bar didn't
Blue hairs on the kush like Marge in it, start with it
Tell a bitch back that ass like she tryna park with it
Hit the gas on the light like a nigga tryna spark with it
I'm a G though, lookin' like Ne-Yo
No I ain't a singer but green, I never see low
How you ain't fuckin' but expectin' me to eat though?
If you ain't fuckin', I'm expectin' you to deep throat
Got a Asian chick, her name is Me Ho
I just say her name when they ask what the cream for
Fuckin' duck tape got me stickin' to the G code
G4, high like fee fo fi fum
Young wild dumb motherfucker got a tongue
High young, die tryin' get the green, nigga fungi
Ill like Will, nigga shout out the alumni
Wah gwaan nigga, ain't shit, y'all pengi
Alert, bitch up in my knapsack
Tell a pussy nigga take a cat nap
Tryna get this cheese like a lab rat
Hatin' niggas tryna set a rat trap
Um, she be on rum
Gave me so much brain, a nigga just dumb
Got the pussy waitin' on the outcome
Mark spots like X, nigga Malcolm
Fuck around, you gon' make a nigga scout him
Doubt him, that nigga ball like the out rim
Bitches waitin' on me 'cause they way the paper on me
I'm makin' paper, hatin' niggas only gon' make it for me
You only one of the fakest, just actin' like you the homie
She only here for my cake 'cause she actin' like she my only
Bag her when she get lonely, slap her up in the mornin'
And tell me, "Tory, I'm horny" I make her feel like a orgy

[Outro]
Wassup motherfucker
I got your bitch in my sock, nigga
Your bitch is now in my sock
She couldn't make it to my knapsack
So she, she jump in my sock
And then, you know I carry her along this path that I walk everyday
Called swave shit
Swavey on the lip ring, bitch
Sincerely Tory, March 26th, niggas
Canada, Toronto, Toronto, Toronto
