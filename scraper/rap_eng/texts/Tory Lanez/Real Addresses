[Chorus]
Whippin' all this dope up in the trap house
We fuck all you bitches at a trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
And I'm in that bitch like Jerry Stackhouse
I might fall in love with my trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses

[Verse 1]
Wait, shit
Fargo, whippin' all this dope look like I'm sellin' phony
All that nigga want that Rollie with the bezel on it
I see niggas change from friends into them tellin' on me
I see niggas go from friends to gettin' jealous on me
I see niggas call their shooters and their felons on me
I see niggas get religious when their hell was comin'
I had to trust the plug sometimes I had no scale up on me
Whip a couple litres now
Trap house got too hot and now I'm trappin' out my fiend's house
Had to break the lease though
And I pay my little nigga just to watch out for police now
'Cause it look like a four in my kitchen
It look like I'm cookin' with them zoes in my kitchen
I'm water whippin', whippin' four with my kitchen
My nigga Trey, he pack a four for you niggas, yeah

[Chorus]
Whippin' all this dope up in the trap house
We fuck all you bitches at a trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
And I'm in that bitch like Jerry Stackhouse
I might fall in love with my trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses

[Verse 2]
Uh, when my grandma kicked me out the house
I said, "Fuck it dawg, I'm 'bout to bounce"
I said, "Fuck it dawg, I gots to make it"
I said, "Fuck it", started hustlin' and got that 'cedes
Uh, my nigga Shadow, he come with that ladder
I know some scammers that come with that data
Gotta ask 'em how we pull up in a Lambo
Shout go out to Dream that Bathing Ape and Camo
Fashion bitch, I'm in the latest
I put all my baddest bitches in their favorite fragrance
I might fuck a country bitch that got that diner, diner
I might make a movie with 'em like I'm Damon Wayans, ya' feel?
I might whip the four in my kitchen
It look like a nigga sellin' Os in my kitchen
I'm whippin', my wrist, it feel cold in this kitchen
And I'm flippin' again, where it goes in this kitchen?

[Chorus]
Whippin' all this dope up in the trap house
We fuck all you bitches at a trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
And I'm in that bitch like Jerry Stackhouse
I might fall in love with my trap house
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
I can't trust you hoes, can't give you real addresses
