[Intro]
Really no need for friends to call tonight
So, I’m…there’s really no need for friends to call tonight

[Verse 1]
Shawty, you my favorite
Please do me a favor, break this nature down to bacon bits
I ain't tryna argue when I tell you girl, "Just take that shit", problems that can wait and shit
Girl, quit actin' like it ain't more ain't money to be made and shit
Rock them heels and twerk up in the mirror to your dance song
Go and take a picture, shawty, get your Instagram on
I'm so interested in something you got
Got that type of pretty that should be up in a news spot, now do you want it?

[Chorus][2X]
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it

[Verse 2]
Know your man be fuckin' with your feelings girl
I got somethin' for you, somethin' for you, you can feel it girl
When you drop it down, that's that killer, girl
Let me get behind your lights, like plates up at the dealer, girl
Don't know what you heard, but shawty 5 for you,and 10 for me
Heard that you from T.O., but that ass looks like it's Tennessee
Can you take it round, after round, after round?
Throw it at me like you at the mound, at the mound oh, put it down

[Chorus][2X]
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it

[Verse 3]
Uh, drop it like it's for your favorite nigga though
Drop that shit like I just cut that check for seven figures though
Jacket back in '92, my daddy was that nigga though
I just need some time to do to exactly what that nigga do
We all back to ballin', someone please go let them strippers know
Fargo in the buildin' and he throwin' out tuition's hoe
All y'all don't even know I'm Mr. Round After Round
Throw it at me like you standin' at the mound, at the mound, get it now

[Chorus][2X]
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout how you put it down on a nigga
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it
It's somethin' 'bout it, it's somethin' 'bout it

[Outro]
On a nigga
How you put it down on a nigga
On a nigga
How you put it down
