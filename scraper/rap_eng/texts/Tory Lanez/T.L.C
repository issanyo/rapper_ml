[Intro]
Also known as a busta

[Verse 1]
Fuck it, I admit it, I did it to get it
I wrote you a song and then did you wrong
I hit it and quit it, forget that I did it
You'll probably call me a busta by the end of this song
But I ain't gon' act like there wasn't a time when I wasn't that guy
And you treated me like a nigga that's just on the passenger side
You and girls were screamin' that Y'all don't wan't no scrubs
I was the nigga that wanted you but ain't get no love
Then I made a decision, I'm with it, it's written
When I catch you slippin', I'm gon' do you wrong
So I done came up now, I got my cake up now
But I cannot forget all the times you used to say to me

[Chorus: TLC]
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say

[Verse 2]
You see I was the nigga that was all on the side of his best friend's ride
See my pockets were thinner and my dollars were slimmer
When I asked for your digits, you simply replied, "No scrubs"
So I finally waited, I waited for you
Plottin' the way I'm gon' do it and waitin' for you to fall trough
I pulled up on you in that rental but you thought that shit was mine
And that's when you came up and gave me your number, it's sick just to know
But I ain't playin' timid, it's guaranteed that we did it
The first night I came over, she had me in her room
And all that I'm thinkin' is look what a car can do
Look at me gettin' you outside your pants and you used to say

[Chorus: TLC]
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say
No, I don't want no scrubs, do you remember that?
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me, do you remember that?
Sittin' on the passenger side 'cause I remember that
Of his best friend's ride tryna holla at me, you and all your friends would say

[Outro]
Fuck it, let's take this shit deeper, back to the day that I seen ya
First time we fucked, you knew I was schemin'
You knew I was leavin', so who's to believe in?
You're back with a vengeance, I was a brand new Beemer
You bust the windows out my car ,fuckin' you
Jasmine Sullivan attitude, Jimmy Choo's, gettin' rude
Eyes attitude passin' by with your different dudes, different crews
Used to see shit eye to eye, we got different views, different views
