[Intro]
Um, what up? It's your boy, it's your bad ol' Tory Lanez, man. And um, I figured a tape wouldn't be right without one of these so. You know how we gon' do it. Sunny on the boys, me on the beat. You know I'ma create some crazy shit like them doowop boys and corner boys back in the day. Let's go

[Verse]
This a story 'bout this girl, her name is Lori
And she livin' right down the street
Ooh baby, with the high school range
Walkin' down 7th street
And you know what they say
'Bout a girl in here is perfect for me
But I'm young and I got high school dreams
Of bein' your dancin' king
Now this story just a little bit different
'Cause Lori 'bout 23
And it's sad that I wanna get a little hot
'Cause I'm only like 17
Girl, I don't wanna wait
Forever for your love
Not another day
So tell me, are you down?
Are you down?
So baby, are you down?
So tell me, are you down?

[Outro]
So you know, I walked into her now. That's pretty much what I told her. She just busted out and just said, "And you know and you know and you know." I'm not, nah she good. Alright, that's that um. She did them ones or twos, man on the microphone on and um, I'm outta here and you know like. You know you
Don't speak it, you don't speak what you don't know. Shoutout all my SLS niggas, we outta here. All my corner boys comin' with me, we outta here. Move back off your shit, my nigga
