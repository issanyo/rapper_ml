[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Those niggas got bread
But it ain’t nothing like me, ha
Hundred bandz on you
Hundred bandz on you

[Verse 1: Syph]
We top down in the summer time
Take flight when it gets cold
I put it down like H-town ‘cause my cup full and I sip slow
All I see is this money, nigga
Can’t see a hater, got tunnel vision
Racks, all my true allegiance
Ballin’ on ‘em is my prescription
I’m about to throw up and grow on this shawty
Her boyfriend a broke nigga but she think he ballin’
Bandz a make her dance so I throw it up
Hundred grand on the floor make you throw up
Nu money, money gang make you know us
In a drop top Massi doin’ donuts
Know us, got my Louis shades on but I can see the money
Now white girl, she keep it comin’
Red bottoms and gold bottles, Louis XIII, that’s nigga money
I put on game but she greed the money
But the game is meant to be sauce
Make a nigga wanna spend one hundred bandz
It's magic on that pole

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
He ain't got no time, baby girl I got
Put your money on me I  got them bandz
Baby girl you want come fuck with me
I'm in my section, baby girl look sexy
When you fuck with me I got them dance
And it ain't  no stress, and it ain't  no stress
I might spend a hundred bandz on you
Like it ain't no conversation cause there ain't no time for waiting
Oh no, I got them hundred bandz on you
Cause there ain't no time
Them niggas got bread, but it ain't nothing like mine
But it ain't nothing like mine, but it ain't nothing like mine
Them niggas got bread, but it ain't nothing like me, ha
Hundred bandz on you, hundred bandz on you

[Verse 2: Syph]
Now all she want is a real nigga
Cause she tired of all them broke niggas
Twenty G's on her cinchilla
My money new, couldn't get better
Them hoes watch, you a transitter
Bitch bad, she a fashion killer
Head to toe in designer clothes
I got time for money you got time for hoes
Bankroll after bankroll
She got time, then I got a plan
Seen her [?] instagram you ain't taking flights
You need a better man
That pussy good I go dumb on it
Plus you keepin' it one hundred
Summer time we 650 when it's time we 700
We gon' ball until we fall out
[?]
Me and my niggas go all out
Got a hundred bad bitches like a doghouse

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
He ain't got no time, baby girl I got
Put your money on me I  got them bandz
Baby girl you want come fuck with me
I'm in my section, baby girl look sexy
When you fuck with me I got them dance
And it ain't  no stress, and it ain't  no stress
I might spend a hundred bandz on you
Like it ain't no conversation cause there ain't no time for waiting
Oh no, I got them hundred bandz on you
Cause there ain't no time
Them niggas got bread, but it ain't nothing like mine
But it ain't nothing like mine, but it ain't nothing like mine
Them niggas got bread, but it ain't nothing like me,ha
Hundred bandz on you, hundred bandz on you
