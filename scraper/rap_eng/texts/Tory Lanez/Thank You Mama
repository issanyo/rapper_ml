[Intro]
Remember, remember, remember
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Remember my first day at school, my moms made it cool
She has me lookin' real fresh with the latest shoes
I had the Nike tie and the datin' suit
So you ain't gotta guess who it's dedicated to
Mama, you the one I need
Ain't another woman that's as beautiful as she
Said if it was from my mama, never could go wrong
And that's the whole reason why I wrote this song
To say hey, hope you know what I'm doin'
I hope that you can hear me from over the moon
And, I'm thinkin' back back, do you remember that that?
I said, "Hey, mom, they hating on my backpack"
So you went to Wal-Mart and copped me some new shit
The bag that all the kids would drool if I went to school in
I said if it was from my mama, never could go wrong
And that's the whole reason why I wrote this song, to say hey

[Chorus]
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama

[Verse 2]
Remember my first trainin' wheels, my moms paid the bill
Real happy all the time, how she made me feel
And we ain't never been rich but she paid the bill
And anythin' I ever wanted she could make it real
Mama kept it so real
It's us against the world ,then we tell them, "Oh well"
I be like, "Oh, hell nah, you talk about my Mom?
It's about to be on in the schoolyard"
I gotta thank my mom for all the things she did
Sittin', reminiscin' on the things you said
If it was from my mama, never could go wrong
And that's the whole reason why I wrote this song, to say hey

[Hook]
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama

[Bridge]
Aw, man, ma, I wish you could see me right now
I'm doin' such great things, I love you
Rest in piece, Luella Peterson
You'll always stay in my heart, Mom
This one's for my mom
I wish that I could see you once more
Just one more time
I miss you so, so much
So, so, so much
So, so, so
So, so

[Chorus]
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama
Hey, thank you, mama
Thank you, mama
