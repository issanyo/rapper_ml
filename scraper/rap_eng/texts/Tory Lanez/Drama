Strugglin', lil niggas is hustlin'
Cops with the K-9 dogs they never muzzlin'
Buttons on apartment floors that we be buzzin' in
Theres something real, someone in trouble and all the youngin' em
I'd kill for my youning' em, feel for the youngin' em
Tryin' to make a mill, to make a meal for my youngin' em
Something I'm discoverin', when we start to love again
That'll be the day we get some peace
But other than that there'll be niggas in the streets
Mad when it's the winter and niggas can't afford heat
When the baby want jordan's but daddy can't afford sneaks
Like whats more important, a pair of J's or the feast
He look at his girl, he gotta provide
It's cold in the house, it's hot outside
And I don't mean that in a weather sense
There's stupid niggas on the premises
Brothers tryin' to be hard headed and so they hella dense
4 year murder still nobody found no evidence
Gotta live your life cause all that other shit irrelevant
Caught up in the light will take your breath up out your ???????
I read about this way back, back in genesis
This is for the mothers holding baby's in they stomachs
Going crazy cause their lover is never there, and rubbers were never there
When lusting you never cared, you frontin'
You just cared about a nut or something
Well something up in your mind was tellin' you don't do it, its too soon
Now you got a little daughter she'll be 2 soon
Plus a son up in your stomach he'll be due in June
And that father try to visit in a blue moon
Its safety still, life ain't a game its real
From the finch to the jane get filled
To the park and the scarbs all the way through steels
Lifes hard, sometimes the cut it might scar
If you live past 18 years your lifes long
Thank god for livin', them bad times we livin' em'
Prayin' that the youth gets baptised I'm serious
Niggas stop selling them cap size, get serious
Need to stop tryna be that guy cause really it
Really ain't worth your soul, ain't worth parole or probation
Life gets more crazy, gotta keep fighting guarantee your gon' make it
Times it will get so deep you can't take it
God gotta be the only one you leave your faith with
Safe it, sacred, place in the safe or the basement
If something worth chasing then chase it
This a serious thing, nothing to play games with
Can't trust friends, some friends will bring hatred
Its safe to say it nigga, its so blatant but God gotta be the only one to leave your faith with
