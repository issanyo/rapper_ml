[Hook]
Out in V Live still talkin' like she know me
New Toronto nigga that finesse like Ginobili
Dancin', dancin'
Touchin' with no hands
She get bands, she expensive
My life is expensive

[Verse 1]
Count me up, expensive
Lookin' like this money that I throw is endless
Rolls Royce and the Benzes
Fuck boy, you will never make the friend list
Strip club, flexin' with my manses
All I see is niggas bitches through my lenses
Ain't gon' lie, that bitch is temptin'
I wanna fuck you but you know I'm too expensive
Foreign bitch and she don't know her grammar
Talkin' money, only time I understand her
All my pieces here like a scammer
I could fuck the bartender and the dancer

[Hook]
Out in V Live still talkin' like she know me
New Toronto nigga that finesse like Ginobili
Dancin', dancin'
Touchin' with no hands
She get bands, she expensive
My life is expensive

[Verse 2]
Boss bitch in the mansion
100s, 50s, money she be handlin'
Fuckin' every bitch you on the 'gram with
Hoppin' out the Wraith, now I'm lookin' like a scammer
MIA, I just landed
Crashed a new Gallardo, did the damage
G5, speakin' Spanish
She said, "dale que tu puedes" and I slammed
Broke bitches drinking but ainâ€™t paying shit
All in my section, we kick bitches out for standin'
500 thou' off of dancin'
She wanna fuck me, but she know I'm too expensive
Tell lil' mama don't fuck up her chances
You tryna get your money, girl, I understand it
Steal that pussy like a bandit
No I can't fuck with you, you too much propaganda

[Hook]
Out in V Live still talkin' like she know me
New Toronto nigga that finesse like Ginobili

[Outro]
And we still at the V Live
Strip club, you in the big time
We'll double back it
We'll double back it, G5
I'm always extra this time
Know you still on me, yeah
Know you still on me, yeah
