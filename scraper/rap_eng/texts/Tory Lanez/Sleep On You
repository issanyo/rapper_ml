Yuh huh ha ha, I get gas and I don’t quit
Add up all the miles I just smile then I split
Uh, cuz I been idle for awhile
Kill the game you suicidal I might need to check ya vitals

Baby do not rock the boat although I think we bout to tip
Oh I think we might’ve capsized just a bit
Feeling like I’m drowning yet I never took a dip
Yet what floats your boat, seems to always sink my ship ha

I’m not ok but that’s ok
Only cuz I know you’re on your way
Oh I like the view
Hope it’s you, yes I do cuz

And it’s through and through, you love me and I love you

Whatcha want? cuz I can help
When you have nothing left to play ya gotta deal with yourself
But I might need some help myself
We tend to show em love, but we never kiss and tell

And I’m alone, so I go to check my phone
Tell my baby girl I, hope you’re coming home
She write me back I write a poem
