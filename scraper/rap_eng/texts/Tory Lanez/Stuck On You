[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
If I said I was a baller like Pippen
And I never played the sport, though I scored
Would you say you liked my game and idea upon it?
Would you say that I'm that MVP for you?
You've got a whole lot of bench warmers
I play full game, got that stench on me
Don't play no games, don't pretend on it
You gon' start with me
We gon' end on it

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Let me do, baby
All the things I said wouldn't do, baby
All the things I wouldn't do
Do for you, baby
Got me, got the high, couldn't lose
Let you pull me in
And I'm stuck on you
And I'm stuck on you
Girl I'm stuck on you

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Lotta things you don't know about me
I'ma show em' to ya, lemme go up in ya
Lemme do a couple things to ya, baby
Lemme do it cause a nigga owe it to ya
I've been waitin' on ya just to bust it on me on that wood floor
Do it to me in the bathroom
Take it everywhere that it should go, yeah, go hard
I mean fuck with me
Cause the last game that you ran on me ain't work
Go on and put plans off for me, girl
Come get hands on with that twerk
Yeah, a lotta things that I wanna do, I say 'em all for ya
Got a nigga come and kicks back in that Kit-Kat, break it off for you

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Let me do, baby
All the things I said wouldn't do, baby
All the things I wouldn't do
Do for you, baby
Got me, got the high, couldn't lose
Let you pull me in
And I'm stuck on you
And I'm stuck on you
Girl I'm stuck on you
