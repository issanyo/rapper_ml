[Intro: Barachi]
(Ooo you wifey)
(Ooo you wifey)

[Chorus: Barachi]
Long hair bottoms red ooo your wifey
Damn I really wanna see you in some Nikes
You remind me of Saweetie girl you icy
I'm gon' take you out the country and go sight seeing
I ain't worried bout your past or ex man
We gon make them haters mad how we flexin'
Long hair bottoms red ooo your wifey
Damn I really wanna see you in some Nikes
(See you in some nikes)

[Verse 1: Barachi]
I ain't worried bout your past ways
I ain't worried about us moving in a fast pace
Ah, ah, i like the way we vibin, chillin', smokin'
On a jet
It’s like we do [??] Way way  back in the day
Love you till I’m gone never do you wrong
Talking like I’m drunk, what the fuck I’m on
Maybe it’s the alcohol talking all along
Or is it the Perignon ,got me thinking you the one
Tell me what did you do this is something new New
Girl did you do voodoo, tell me what did you do
Maybe it’s the alcohol talking all along
Love you till I’m gone, put that on my mom

[Chorus: Barachi]
Long hair bottoms red ooo your wifey
Damn I really wanna see you in some Nikes
You remind me of Saweetie girl you icy
I'm gon' take you out the country and go sight seeing
I ain't worried bout your past or ex man
We gon make them haters mad how we flexin'
Long hair bottoms red ooo your wifey
Damn I really wanna see you in some Nikes
