[Intro]
Tory
I'm so tired of you niggas
Got it on smash!
You and all these bitches that be lyin' in ya pictures
I'ma take a jet and I'ma fly my niggas
Somewhere so big I canâ€™t find my niggas
Ayy, and I'm trying my nigga
But you making hard to be around y'all niggas
And this is why I only be around my niggas
Come around I gotta look you up and down my nigga

[Verse 1]
I can't be around you fuck niggas, that just ain't me
Had to check myself, uh, I'm the same me
And I bust it like the clip when it's off safety, don't make me
And them fuck-boy hatin' niggas tryna replace me
'Cause I give them boys the blues like I'm a Grape Street G
And no, got no Gucci on me but I just stay GG'd
And when I pop up and hop to the mall I spend like 18 Gs on nothing
She ride me like a ATV
I keep her Dolce-Gabbana'd up so she can stay DG'd
And I swear that batty so big that I can't stay PG
But I stay all up on your block just like the state PD
You know I cross my I's and I just dot my T's
And I just hang with the same niggas from all my team
When I come up I promise we gonna ball together
'Cause when we came up from nothing we was all together

[Bridge]
I'm talking, all together, we was all together
When we came up from nothing, we was all together
When we all together, we was all together
When we came up from nothing, we was all together, yeah

[Verse 2]
And I can't let no money get between us
And I can't let no bitches get between us
Gotta stack this money with my team (Ayy, he knows)
All together, all together when we
Came up from nothing, we just ball together
And we never trust these bitches that we dog together
Whether big or we small or we tall together, I know
Dog forever, that's my dog forever
I'm gon' ball forever, fuck these broads forever
I got bags of money, I can't stop forever, you see
One Umbrella baby we gon' star together, one time
Yeah, and I'm big checkin'
I make so many hits I'm wondering did I miss yet?
Did I miss yet?
And tell me which nigga that I sound like this time
I turn a four-figure to a six-figure cheque, yeah, tell me do it sound right this time?
When there's more niggas tryna copy me, they tryna sound bite this line
And these pussy-ass niggas tryna hate on me
I put it down right this time
I think it's 'bout right this time
I think it's about right this time

[Outro]
I'm so tired of you niggas
You and all these bitches that be lyin' in ya pictures
I'ma take a jet and i'ma fly my niggas
Somewhere so big I can't find my niggas
