[Intro]
Think We Found A LoopHole
From nothin' to somethin'
It's Tory, ayy
Ayy, ayy
I swear the trap doing numbers, ayy

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Fuck with you tonight you know I am (ahh)
'Cause my work is doing numbers out the gym (ay)
Used to have to sell the work to pay the rent (yeah)
Now my work is doing numbers out the gym, uh (yeah)

Fuck with you tonight you know I am (ahh)
'Cause my work is doing numbers out the gym (ay)
Used to have to sell the work to pay the rent (yeah)
Now my work is doing numbers out the gym, uh (yeah)

[Verse]
Wait, uh, just in (just in)
Brand new message that my Glock came with an extend (extend)
Trap doing numbers out the gym
Used to have to sleep on the couch at my best friend's
Used to think I gotta make my exit (yeah)
Then the trap started booming, it was pregnant (yeah)
And we smokin' presidential, no election (oh)
And I don't gotta beg nobody for no breakfast, no
'Cause shit is real, niggas they don't know the way I came up
They don't know the way I feel
They don't know about the nights when I was broke off in the field
Family worried if I'ma win but shit I told 'em that I will
Aliziana drivin' tryna to find a better deal
Tryna find me a connect and drop the driver to the hill, uh
Tryna see a half a mil, uh
By any means we get it, ay

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Fuck with you tonight you know I am (ahh)
'Cause my work is doing numbers out the gym (ay)
Used to have to sell the work to pay the rent (yeah)
Now my work is doing numbers out the gym, uh (yeah)

Fuck with you tonight you know I am (ahh)
'Cause my work is doing numbers out the gym (ay)
Used to have to sell the work to pay the rent (yeah)
Now my work is doing numbers out the gym, uh (yeah)
