[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I've been all night
My shit been popping
Club hopping all night
I ain't living right
I ain't living right
But I'm gon' get right
I'm gon' get right
I'm gon' get right
I get too fucked up but I'm gon' get right
I smoke way too much but I'm gon' get right
I like my cup full but I'm gon' get right
I've been all night
So I'm gon' get right

[Verse 1: Trav]
I ride four deep in this Phantom
Bitches see me start to panic
I just poured a three inside a Fanta nigga that's a dirty diana
When I was broke nigga where was you
Now I fuck bitches just by the twos
Somebody call Tarentino for this movie
I drink this lean like its apple juice
Dreams of coppin a Porsche
I just bought a Wraith
I remember them bitches just tried to play me
Now they just fuck me, suck me all crazy
I'm gon' get right
I've been club hopping, pill popping all night
I ain't living right
I ain't living right
But I'm gon' get right
I'm gon' get right
I'm gon get right, no rehab, Amy Winehouse
Percocets and xans, it help me wind down

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I've been all night
My shit been popping
Club hopping all night
I ain't living right
I ain't living right
But I'm gon' get right
I'm gon' get right
I'm gon' get right
I get too fucked up but I'm gon' get right
I smoke way too much but I'm gon' get right
I like my cup full but I'm gon' get right
I've been all night
So I'm gon' get right

[Verse 2: Trav]
So much money on my mind
Hope I don't run out of time
Taking these drugs and fucking these hoes that's all I do all of the time
My girl want me to go rehab, and I said no, no, no
Cause I smoke dro, dro, dro
This lean keep me slow, slow, slow
Taking these Percs just to keep my some patience
I just want time now cause I got no patience
If you don't want to fuck then you got to go
I get the money then I hit the road
I got that work on the banana boat
I'm sending them bricks in
They coming from Michigan
I'm sending them bricks in
Popping these pain pills
But I feel the pain still
These nigga be so fake
But I'm gon' remain real

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I've been all night
My shit been popping
Club hopping all night
I ain't living right
I ain't living right
But I'm gon' get right
I'm gon' get right
I'm gon' get right
I get too fucked up but I'm gon' get right
I smoke way too much but I'm gon' get right
I like my cup full but I'm gon' get right
I've been all night
So I'm gon' get right
