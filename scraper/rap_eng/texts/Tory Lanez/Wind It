[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Girl, I love it when you wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it
You shut the club down, shut the club down, shut the club down, shut the club down
Girl, I wanna see you wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it
Girl, shut the club down, shut the club down, shut the club down, shut the club down
Girl, I wanna see you wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Baby, when you drop it low, you bring it back and drop it slow
I have to ask on my behalf, can you come here
And wind it back the whole way down?
Let me watch the whole way down
I, I say girl you know you got me movin', I can feel your body groovin'
Back and forth, you pull me over
Let me bring your body back the whole way down
Let me watch the whole way down

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I'm northern lights, she a southern girl
Magazine love, be my cover girl
She's a fly gal, be my hover girl
Body fragile, ain't no tupperware
See me I love to work, no one will ever duck
Them other women she don't see 'em like they lover there
Yeah they be hatin' 'cause I be there in December fur
Although they love you, it feels like they don't care
Oh my gosh, oh my gosh, oh my gosh
You are now the finest woman on my roster
You know I'm tryna crack it open like a locker
You dancin' like a movie, you deserve an Oscar

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
I can't wait 'til the sun goes down
When you dance with me, let it go go down
I can't wait 'til the sun goes down
When you dance with me, let it go go down
Bust it out
Right now, you are in that swave, swave, swave
I can't wait 'til the sun goes down
When you dance with me, let it go go down
I can't wait 'til the sun goes down
When you dance with me, let it go go down
I can't wait 'til the sun goes down
When you dance with me, let it go go down
I can't wait 'til the sun goes down
When you dance with me, let it go go down

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Girl, I love it when you wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it
You shut the club down, shut the club down, shut the club down, shut the club down
Girl, I wanna see you wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it, wind it
Girl, shut the club down, shut the club down, shut the club down, shut the club down
Girl, I wanna see you wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it, please just press rewind it
Wind it, wind it
