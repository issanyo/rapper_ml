TRANSCRIBING



[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I can't sleep on you
I apologize, but I got my eyes on you
I gotta try, I ain't gotta lie on you
Just call me up, and you know I'm coming
Long as you keep things 100
Keep shit 100
She keep it 100

[Verse 1: MTG]
Lil mama got a swag to her
But I'ma make her walk with a limp
It ain't nothing to a real nigga baby
Fuck the lil nigga, shawty we can go take a trip
A real nigga, foreal nigga now check it
All I know is real niggas no flexin'
They call me MTG
I might've started from the bottom now I'm the MVP
E's up, had a pinkie to your peace sign
Lil mama wit it, shawty asked me how the G's ride
And she a pro in the game
I met her out in the Chi caused she was raised out in Queens
A lot of thots get slept on
Ain't no doubt about it, lil mama got her head on
I got a thing for them redbones
But the caramel's is what I live for

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I can't sleep on you
I apologize, but I got my eyes on you
I gotta try, I ain't gotta lie on you
Just call me up, and you know I'm coming
Long as you keep things 100
Keep shit 100
She keep it 100
