I can't sleep on you
I apologize, but I got my eyes on you
I gotta shine, ain't gotta lie on you
Just call me up, and you know I'm coming
Long as you keep shit one hunned
Keep shit one hunned
But she ain't keep it a hunned

[Verse 1: G. Twilight]
I remember it like yesterday... all them lies she told
Still can't figure out what I did to make her treat me so cold
Signs was compatible but don't believe the hype
I wasn't her type
She wasn't my type
Wasted five years of my life on a bitch who wasn't shit
And Taurus females is stubborn as shit
I knew better, but I did it anyway
Logic thrown out the window emotions all in the way
Her Virgo ex broke her heart had her feeling lifeless
Instead growin' up she want revenge so now she act the nicest
To me, cause in the street I was gettin’ down trifest
Got my mind, by giving me somethin’ priceless
And in time I realized her thighs was all I need, more than weed
Then she hit me off wit’ lies and greed
I kept it one hunned, she kept it forty-nine percent
Cheated on me wit' a nigga who couldn't pay his rent
He was squattin' in houses, owe thousand in back child support
No bank account, garnishment from friend of the court
A dusty ass nigga broker than the ten commandment
I'm so confused.. I can't understand it

I can't sleep on you
I apologize, but I got my eyes on you
I gotta shine, ain't gotta lie on you
Just call me up, and you know I'm coming
Long as you keep shit one hunned
Keep shit one hunned
But she ain't keep it a hunned

[Verse 2: G. Twilight]
At the same time my relationship was falling apart
I had another situation that was bout to start
Another Taurus.. pretty face, big booty
Thick in the thighs, high cheek bones, she was a cutie
All during my relationship, she kept droppin' hints
Flirtin' like she want me, but naw I guess she didn't
I thought she was a diamond, I thought she was a purl then
Found she only wanted me because I had a girlfriend
When I was boo'd up, could've got them drawls
But now that I’m single, she won't answer my calls
How could this be? I’m nigga she curves (swerve)
My homeboy watched me strike out and then he got up the nerve
He didn't even want her, til’ found out I wanted
Liking stats and droppin’ comments, now he all up on her
He wasn't my really friend, he wasn't my enemy
Somewhere in between a frenemy
All in her imbox til’ he got reaction
Got her phone number now he bout to get in that action
What I thought was a champ turned out to be a losers
She fucked my frenemy in the backseat of a PT cruiser

[Verse 3: G. Twilight]
People ain’t shit, keep your eye on everybody
Don't apologize.. just keep your eye on everybody
People ain’t shit, that’s why you gotta keep a grip
On your friends.. as well as your relationships
Only time they keep it a hunned is when they use emoji's
So don't say you real, don’t tell me, just show me
Keep it one hunned.. like a hundred dollar bill
But even those change, yeah that's the real
From small face to big face
From green paper to blue
So.. to thine own self you must be true
Fear no nigga, trust no bitch
Stack that paper, stick to the script
Get money, get money, fuck everything else
After all I been through trust nobody else
In Detroit they don't know how to act
So I gotta watch my front, I gotta watch my back
Cain killed Abel, Jesus was betrayed by Judas
Delilah seduced Samson, Caesar was stabbed by Brutus
Every family has a Fredo, Rico shot Mitch
When you get a real life knife in your back, maan.. it's a bitch
