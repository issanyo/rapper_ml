[Verse 1]
Now baby, I've been thinkin' lately
Beauty in pictures shit, pictures that I've been paintin'
Think you a cutie, baby, your beauty is amazin'
I wanna say somethin' to you but don't wanna be basic
Thinkin' should say hi, or should I let it go
Can make it through the eye, but we've been here before
Girl, do we even try? Baby, I should let you know
When another brother come up, I prolly couldn't let you go
Now shawty, know we young but why are we bein' patient?
Time is of the virtue, why is it bein' wasted?
Wanna be your man, I'm tryna be in the placement
Talkin' 'bout the man who tryna be a replacement, listen
I lay somethin' and tell you I ain't frontin'
Say it to my face when you tell me, you ain't runnin'
And if you straight clean and baby, the pain comin'
All I needin' for you to do is say somethin', please

[Chorus]
Why don’t you say hello, say hello
I see you starin', won't you say hello?
Say hello, say hello
I say to sing because your beautiful, say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello

[Verse 2]
Now baby hurry, we gettin' hasty
Got me feelin' faded from every time that you face me
Got me in the moves 'cause baby that’s where you take me
Right up in the brain, just place me in case we
Feelin' like the race we runnin' is untastely
Feelin' like the change is comin' is come vaguely
Feel my heart race like the F1 blazin'
Thinkin' you the girl, not a next one baby
Now we can keep it cool or we can sit and laugh
But don't waste me and you off the issues of the past
I'm itchin' to sit in a position to be your man
You got me afflicted, I'm really feelin' it's a plan
Listen, I'm feelin' you but the message ain't gettin' through
Shawty, is it true just expressions of lettin' go
'Cause all U wanna do is to tell you and let you know
And all you got to do is say hello

[Chorus]
Why don’t you say hello, say hello
I see you starin', won't you say hello?
Say hello, say hello
I say to sing because your beautiful, say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello

[Bridge]
Take a chance, take a risk
You may find yourself falling in love
Only you hold the keys
To escape from the all the fears of your heart
So say, say something to me
Just say something to me
Just say something to me
Just say something to me
Just say something to me
Just say something to me

[Chorus]
Why don’t you say hello, say hello
I see you starin', won't you say hello?
Say hello, say hello
I say to sing because your beautiful, say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello
Your eyes, your hair, your lips, your scent, your smile
Makes me wanna say hello
