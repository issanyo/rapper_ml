[Verse 1]
Relaxing on the couch is how it started out
Telephone ring, what's this all about?
12 up in the AM, we'll keep it on the phone
I wish my little breezy say she's all alone
Shawty, what you doin'? Won't you come on over?
We can make a movie, TV show like Oprah
Girl, we can get it on until the passin' time
We can cut it down until her body cums
Ay, you wanna ride, well baby, come on
I'll give you my game if you give up the score
By the way that Goose is on your pillow there
So take a shot for later, can help by the dance

[Chorus]
Girl, you at the house
Take a shot for later
It's about to go down
I'ma work that body out
I'ma work that body out
Shawty, let me work it out

[Verse 2]
Shawty, got a body, let me work it out
Up until it's day and we gon' burn it out
Girl, you need a lover, won't you stop playin'?
Even at the bottom, you my top lady
Girl, we'll do everythin' that we ever did
I promise after this you'll be finished with him
Baby girl, I'm hopin' you stay true, baby
'Cause all I wanna do is freak with you

[Chorus]
Girl, you at the house
Take a shot for later
It's about to go down
I'ma work that body out
I'ma work that body out
Shawty, let me work it out

[Verse 3]
Oh you lookin' bad, oh you lookin' mean
Damn you got your body, look at your physique
Damn you look amazin', single and you freaky
You should be my baby, you should leave with me

[Chorus]
Girl, you at the house
Take a shot for later
It's about to go down
I'ma work that body out
I'ma work that body out
Shawty, let me work it out

[Outro]
Baby, let me touch up on it
Help you make it feel the way it should feel
For real, for real, let me make you feel like
Let me make you feel like
Let me make you, let me, let me make you feel like
Touch me, you just wanna love me
I just wanna make you feel good
I just wanna make you feel good, so good
To the point where you know what to do
With yourself, with yourself
With yourself

Come here, baby. Right here. Yeah, that's it. Classic
