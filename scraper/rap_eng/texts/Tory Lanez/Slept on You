[Verse 1: Bun B]
Man, this girl a dime with a penny added
Lookin' like my future wife, somebody let me at it
Damn baby, it's the business and built for it
Sittin' on swole, man, I had to get some seals for it
I walked up and said, "Let me introduce me"
You lookin' like a star, we need to make a movie
She said it's cool and all but you must not remember that
We made one in September, damn I must've slept on you, girl

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You, talkin' 'bout we met before this
Girl, I must've slept on you
But shawty are you really sure?
I don't how I could of slept on you
It's gotta be that dress on
You killin' em, dead wrong
And I don't wanna sing the same song
But I don't know how I could of slept on you
I slept on you
I don't know how I could of slept on you
I slept on you
Baby girl, I must of slept on

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Ain't no way that I could miss you, girl
Your face is worth my kisses, plus you paint that perfect picture
You the baddess and I never had a chick that has your status
So I'm glad but all them hatin' chicks, they mad
Haha, laughin' in they faces, guess they just gon' have to face it
Coppin' cases of your favourite bottles, prolly gettin' wasted
Layin' naked on the beaches, check the facial on your features
I mean features on your facial, all them divas they must hate ya like they racist
But they racial profilin' on your style because we colors, you be wylin'
Girl, your tan is from the island, as your man, you keep me smilin'
Buy you handfuls of the finest, you the finest
Time is money, use the label but your face is just so timeless

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You, talkin' 'bout we met before this
Girl, I must've slept on you
But shawty are you really sure?
I don't how I could of slept on you
It's gotta be that dress on
You killin' em, dead wrong
And I don't wanna sing the same song
But I don't know how I could of slept on you
I slept on you
I don't know how I could of slept on you
I slept on you

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
I slept on you, girl, I'm so sorry
Come here, work that body, rock that dress for me
Yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah yeah yeah, Canada

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You, talkin' 'bout we met before this
Girl, I must've slept on you
But shawty are you really sure?
I don't how I could of slept on you
It's gotta be that dress on
You killin' em, dead wrong
And I don't wanna sing the same song
But I don't know how I could of slept on you
