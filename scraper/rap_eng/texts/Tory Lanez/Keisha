[Intro]
Yeah, you did me wrong, you did me wrong, Keisha
All I ever wanted was a little piece of your time
Oh, Keisha, did me wrong, did me wrong
And you know you did

[Verse]
God didn't make this time for us to waste it
Baby, he just made his time and came to us to pace it
Baby, he just gave you dreams, girl, so you could chase 'em
Baby, he just gave you me, girl, so you ain't basic
Baby, you got some problems you need to tend to
Baby, you got it obvious, you got issues
Maybe you need to keep it real with yourself
Instead of ridin' around in that black nine-five
On 2 with the tint on the windows
Hope you know I can see what you're in though
When you're drivin' by, watch you eye to eye
I know you see it, ooh Keisha, you know you did it
This love girl, you know you quit it
It's over, I know it's over, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
'Cause one minute you're down, down and you committed
Next thing you're down, out and you don't get it
I ain't holdin' you down, down on love
Unless you're down, down on love
'Cause one minute you're down, down and you committed
Next thing you're down, out and you don't get it
I ain't holdin' you down, down on love
Unless you're down, down on love
