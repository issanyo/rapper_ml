[Verse 1]
Can someone tell that bitch, take her shoes off at the door?
When she walk all on my marble floor, I stunt like I'm supposed to
Black dreads hangin' off my niggas, shouts to Noah
Walk inside my crib, see dough so thick she can't even fold
Tell me why your bitch keep patrollin' like she 5-0
Say that she my bitch, but that bitch ain't even side hoe
She gon' keep on workin' it for Fargo 'til them thighs broke
I can't throw no benjies if I ever see my side broad
Talk about your money, that's that shit that I don't gotta
We talk about your bitch, but tell the truth, man I forgot her
Or smokin' on some potent shit, that's loud as the whole choir
If I don't say shut up no more, I just say lil hoe quiet
They know why, shit 'cause
I been with the killers talkin' dealers smoke 'em
Niggas speakin' to you, but ain't really talkin'
Sittin' in the trap, eatin' cup of noodles
Higher than a nigga, Andy Milonakis
Niggas used to get about an 8-ball
Now he tryna get about a boat load
Condo sittin' out SoHo, smokin' on high grade
Sippin' on slow mo', nigga what's up?

[Hook]
You knew, I always said I'd be the one
Said I'd be the one
Spendin' all my 24 to get it
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission

[Verse 2]
Shit, don't forget to tell yo bitch, take your shoes off at the door
When she walk on top this Persian rug, I stunt like I'm supposed to
Backwood swingin', smokin', hangin' out the door
Black draws showin', y'all glowin' from my gold
Ghetto boujee nigga, order steak but eat the ramen noodles
Don't love your bitch, just fuck your bitch when I got time to do it
I say she lyin' if she say she wasn't tryna do it
Fargo ain't no rookie, mane, that boy a pussy connoisseur
I know she won't fuck a famous nigga and be lit
Just like I'm playin' tackers, I can't fuck unless she hit
It's your nigga, heard Argie Fargo, bitch, you used to braid my hair
Now you here up in my condo tryna fuckin' be legit
Is she trill? Shit?
I be in the city where my niggas loco
By the Yorkdale while the bitches open
Bitches say I'm wavy like I'm in the ocean
Pray that we never got to let the semi open
Made it to the he said, she said shit
Unless he said she said, that she taken
Ride around the city for a one time
Shawty fuckin' with me but I only fuck one time, Fargo

[Hook]
You knew, I always said I'd be the one
Said I'd be the one
Spendin' all my 24 to get it
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission
Yeah, that's the mission
