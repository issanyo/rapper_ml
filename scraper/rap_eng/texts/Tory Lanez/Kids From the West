[Intro: DJ Drama]
To be honest, we destined for greatness
You know like TV, every day shit
To be even more honest, your time may be up
You know like only on TV once
On TV1, destined for a tragic unsung story
I’m sorry, you just didn’t play your cards right

[Verse: Tory Lanez]
Nigga, ma died daddy wasn't there
I was out here gettin’ money with the scale
Brother in jail, need a canteen?
Now I’m sendin' money in the mail
Runnin' from the law
Only thing a nigga fearin' out here is the Lord, nigga
Did it all for my dogs, in a fresh pair of draws
Aw yeah, hit the window with the top down
Ride around, niggas in the mini caravan
Lookin' for a new wrist
Drop down in a bent air force, I be lookin' for a new link
Sure nigga, oh boy, you can tell them old niggas that it’s over
Nigga came with that new shit, true shit
Dog, I been waitin' on you niggas
Motherfuckers hatin’ on me, but it’s cool
I’m gettin' paper, why you suckers got to play on a nigga?
For the name hoes change, nigga
Watch what you claim on these bitches
But the fame, my nigga
For the fame, only real bitch I had was Keisha
And she still changed on a nigga
You could picture the pain in my scriptures
Lame in your mixture
Young nigga, hangin' my tone
From the cold ass nights I was stinkin' alone
And my clothes ranked and they reeked of the dank ass weed
From the blanks and the floor, my nigga
Just love if you love me, don’t ask me for nothin'
Just know that you got it
When Jay comin' back to Miami next week
Then you know that it’s poppin'
I’m all in your crib like I'm Santa bitch
Don’t make me open your stockings, open like Stockton
Grandma told me if I’m gonna be somethin'
Then it better be lawyer or doctor
But I'ma make more as a rapper, make more as a rapper
She ain’t believe me, I did it and told her to open my chapter
And that’s how you show by example

[Outro: DJ Drama]
You see, my mom always thought I should get a regular job
She didn’t really see the future in this, I had to show her
I had the license to burn money in what I was doing
I haven’t had a real job in 20 years
If we can do it, so can you
