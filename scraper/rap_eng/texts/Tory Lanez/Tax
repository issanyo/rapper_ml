[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I'ma throw another bag on them bitches
Cop car, dropped call, get a tag on them bitches
I want money in full, get exact on them bitches
With my dogs on the boulevard
And we going hard for the bag on them bitches
Nigga know we tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
Young nigga gotta tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches

[Verse 1: T.R.O]
Yeah, used to the lot of these popular views
I'm easing up on the tension
Conversing with bitches with similar views
Got all my attention
I told 'em that we gon' bring light to the city
Look how they counted us out
Reservations at tables, don't pay for the bottles
They front the amount
Tell the waiters we want it on ice
Nigga keep all the sparkle 'cause that's never cool
I'm in cahoots with some niggas that duck the attention
'Cause that go against all the rules
It's really some niggas that wanna be famous
We'd rather be rich you can tell that we different
I make her feel like she really a part
Then I pick up her calls under certain conditions
I'm really the nigga they know that's the coldest
All of my niggas they locked and they loaded
I'm always reminded that I'll be the greatest
And all of my old shit is good as your latest
I told all these bitches we blowin' the bag
We livin' the shit that we did in the past
The feeling's organic we do it again
I always considered you niggas pretend

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I'ma throw another bag on them bitches
Cop car, dropped call, get a tag on them bitches
I want money in full, get exact on them bitches
With my dogs on the boulevard
And we going hard for the bag on them bitches
Nigga know we tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
Young nigga gotta tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches

[Verse 2: T.R.O]
I remember they said that we couldn't, but look now we up
Since they said that they love us I'll tell you what's harder to trust
Cuttin' ties with these niggas I'm tryna make room for the real
'Cause I'm headin' up for the hills
'Cause I wanted it all for the profits to split with my niggas
'Cause I put it on me to make sure that we livin'
Remember when money didn't make us no different
They paid me in full just to make an appearance
I bring out of town they go off for the kid
I been selective I'm taking my pick
I'm being choosy 'cause I never take this for granted
I'd rather not be in the mix
Yeah, I'm willing to give everything that I got for the love of the fam
Embracing the lows 'cause that really made me the nigga I am
Tory gave me the word
We fly to Toronto, we taxin' them bitches
Just some young niggas in it for riches
Yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I'ma throw another bag on them bitches
Cop car, dropped call, get a tag on them bitches
I want money in full, get exact on them bitches
With my dogs on the boulevard
And we going hard for the bag on them bitches
Nigga know we tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
Young nigga gotta tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
Young nigga put the tax on them bitches
