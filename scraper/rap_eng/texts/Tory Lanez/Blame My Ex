[Verse 1]
Every girl that I end up with started on some love shit
Ended on some rough shit, I know that I fucked it
Up, when I did dumb shit, plus we were both rushing
We don't know what love is, no no
So if you're gon' kick me out, then fucking kick me out
I got a condo in Toronto when I get
Lonelier then ever, colder than December
Focus on something better 'cause you ain't around

[Chorus]
If you wonder why I do 'em wrong
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
The reason I'm dying in this song
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex

[Verse 2]
I just met this new girl, said her name is Cindy
She could be good for me, I can't let her tempt me
I know what I want and she know too
We gon' do what we gon' do
Baby girl, you're sexy, wanna get
All over your bed sheets, then I'm gone in the morning

[Chorus]
If you wonder why I do 'em wrong
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
The reason I'm dying in this song
Blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex, blame my ex
