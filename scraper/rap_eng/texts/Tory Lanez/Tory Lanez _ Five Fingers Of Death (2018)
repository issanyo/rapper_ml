[Verse 1]
My Glock crazy, fiends on my block brazy
A lot of niggas sendin' shots that cannot phase me
Cops movin', niggas shootin' at the opps daily
My momma died, but my pop raised me
The block made me tuck grips and serve rocks daily
I started scammin’, had my bitches doin' drops, crazy
Listen, I got a vision of a all white Wraith with the inside interior seat color of hot gravy
Have it lookin' like a dinner when I'm drivin'
My grip like my dick, it get bigger when I slide in
45th skippin' like flipper on the glide-in
Comin' through the spot, jewels drippin' like Poseidon
Different bitches trippin', tryna get up right beside 'em
I'm S5, fifth drivin' out the sunroof
Clique flyin' while my niggas stick-shift and try and switch irons
He was trippin', gear shift and let his bitch drive it
I'm talkin' violation, my lil' niggas out here robbin' niggas for the love of ballin' like Sanaa Lathan
And they some cold-hearted niggas but that's how I raised 'em
Scrape a opp off the board before you dry erase 'em
He put his hands on your brother? You gotta fade 'em
He put his hands on your sister, it's annihilation
I'm in the sky racin', Henny shot chasin', bad bitches one plan, and that's to end up on the yachts naked
Stand on your block, fuck how the opps take it
I let the ooze down his throat like he shot chasin'
But if we grapple, dawg, I beat your face red and white and have it lookin' like I just bit the apple off
My momma died, I lost my mind and couldn't cope with it
And niggas kept on pokin' at my open shit
So I sold dope and moved O's and made hope of it
And got busy with any nigga that made joke of it
Made a lil' change, boom bam, studio equip
Fast forward couple years later, sittin' in them Range Rover tints
My life is crazy, ice is hazy
Overnight flight, how to expedite your lady
For the right price, I could get you striked, it's crazy
Money height like Dwight on a flight with KD
Crazy how I pulled up in a drop Rolls
Pocket rocket in my sneaker, right above the sock rolls
I keep it on me and my block knows
Because, without it, somethin's missin', like the nose ring on Pac's nose
Bandana tied, blam-blam your ride, Rob Van Dam the man inside, that you gave your hand to drive
I'm so sick I spit flows with a whole infection
Time's hard and niggas gotta split the O in sections
No burners, like fuckin' hoes, no protection
But that's rare, like a fat ass with no injections
Presidential kush, it could've took the whole election
I got a whole collection of a home grown selection
Me and broke niggas, two things with no connection
I can't see 'em like the FaceTime with no reception
I'm crazy, I'm goin’ ballistic for the gravy, I'll let it go in your biscuit
From the screw face, cat black, you know that I'm twisted, stupid aim
My trigger finger itchin’ goin’ autistic, told I'm aimin’ for the headshot

[Verse 2]
You could see the moisture
Put shells in your mouth like you eatin’ oysters
I book niggas librarian quick
And put them thangs on the boat like Nigerian kids
I'ma black mac, hoodie up
I ain't do it for the look until I got the Ramada poppin’ and booked it up
The car, man, you gotta look it up
I hustle drugs like me on a song, nigga, I hook it up
I shook it up and made a wish with it
Then my enemies started dyin’ from young niggas in Knicks fitteds
That sell dope, so they can go and cop the kicks with it
I pop a nigga whole chick and take flicks in it
But I'm not a pornstar, I hit the OnStar
I'm tryna find me some wet pussy and a long jaw
Fantastic, I'ma damn bastard, 21 guns like I'ma damn savage
With two of them, I can make both your mans catch it
Then pay a donation, pay both your mans' caskets
I'll show up to the wake, with this pump in my Bape
Just to view the body slumped in his state
Yo, my opps took so many friends from me
I got more hate for them niggas than Ted Bundy
Drama on my mind, who gon' get this lead from me?
Fuck niggas up and laugh like somethin’ I said funny
It's been a long minute, yeah, it's been a long time
I got a lot of bitches, yeah, that shit a long line
My nuts swingin’ like them thangs from Tha Dogg Pound
These niggas say they gettin' money need to calm down
'Cause listen nigga, I break fast and scramble and breakfast, all I'm missin’ is the cheese and the salmon and baked mash
These niggas say they singin’ and rappin’, it's straight trash
You hearin’ Tory singin’ and rappin’, you pay cash
My album bought to drop, nigga
I'ma bout to pop, nigga
How I shoot guns and go platinum off pop, nigga?
This off top, but I ain't gon' stop man, I stay on D-Block like I started as The Lox, nigga

[Verse 3]
I used to fear that the bitches didn't like me
And then I got bread and only niggas didn't like me
But niggas shouldn't like me, I was hittin' niggas wifey
In the kitchen, hand frostbitten, wrist icy
Chick pricey, but I fuck a different one every night, my dick shiesty
My drive-thru money is krumpin’, it's gettin' hyphe
My McDonald's order is a Litty McSpicy
They really just nize me
I hit Bella and Ella in the same night
When they hear this freestyle, they gonna say, "your game tight"
A lot of niggas, they ain't right in they mind, I mean let alone writin' they lines, but take this
I'm the only artist you know can sing to your bitch
And then talk back greezy, it's really that easy
And you gon' believe me, you know I gets busy, nigga
'Cause I stay next to the keys just like Swizzy, nigga
A nigga think I'm pussy, I like that shit better so the feelin' less expected when I get the nigga
I'm hot-style, 'bout the break the turntables
You'd think I'm clearin’ evidence the way I burn paper
They know I earn paper as soon as I learn paper
The traphouse crack smoke smell like burnt vapor
Through the back rows, the money and stacks grow
I got stacks 'bout as long as Kat Stacks nose
This is facts, my niggas are goin' jack mode for me
Wilin', kick back those for me
It's funny how my lil niggas do it out of spite
I'm ridin' with the 2 and I can do 'em out the night
These niggas call me crazy, I'ma do 'em out the night
Your newest shit is trash, I just threw it out tonight, nigga

[Verse 4]
Fuck the chit-chat, tell me where the chicks at
I'll leave six shots in a nigga's six pack
My chick's strapped, rubber grip with the kickback
Yeah we hittin' licks and niggas still ain't get they lick back
I'm on fire, yeah I'm on NBA ham time
I'm gettin' rings like Sonic on the hang glide
Damn I'm so damn fly
This swag kill a nigga so hard I just seen his man die
Stand by, I got bitches on the landline
I could sell it by the pan or the gram in this
Scramble in the lamb like I got the shit pan-fried
So nasty and so classy
Have you lookin' like Ryan Leslie when Diddy stole Cassie
Ain't no blowin' past me
The rock's got so much knots the block's thinkin' that it's goin' badly
I come through and fly, man dead
I stick a nigga like Spiderman webs
Ride a car door till your rider man dead
I was only comin' for your rider man's head
I done hit so many IG bitches
I can't even go on IG and slide IG pictures
My life is a movie on widescreen, nigga
So one eye open like Fozzi, nigga

[Verse 5]
'Cause I be at the dice game
I got precise aim
I said the same thing to him when his wife came
I got the white chains, it's lookin’ like the lights came
And bang so hard off the rays that my eyes changed
I'm quite tame when these niggas try hurt me
I burn you fuck niggas like a bitch that got Herpes, no mercy
A bad bitch'll hop in my whip and chauffeur me
Lil' class, like a nigga home early
I tell you get the picture, nigga
'Cause I'll put the shots on y'all like you payin’ for the liquor, nigga
You'll get smoked like a Swisher, nigga
I do 'em like the old days, four ways, how I split the nigga
From the B into the Finch West, they know my name, more savvy in the city than a bench press
These niggas hustle, I ain't impressed
I sold bags of the white more tight than 50 Cent's vest
From G-Unit, all I need is three units
Can't see me, but I'm the illest cat you seen do this
I be movin’ with disciples
And you a pre-Judas
Bounty on his head, yeah, that's how you reuse it
Puttin’ powder in the engine, and the guns in the fenders
Coke and the drugs by my tongue and my dentures
I couldn't make this up if I tried to
I flip the pot ... lied to
I slide my guys through burnin’ size five-two, I leave 'em bloody
Leave 'em bangin’ like he bangin’ Piru
I'm slangin' on this corner, I'm slangin' mine too
I don't stress, I might just let the gun bless him like he sayin’ achoo
You don't really wanna square it up
'Cause I'm focused, you won't notice
Like when Sway came back and his hair was cut
I'm goin’ fast no matter whatever gear I clutch
These niggas crazy... I touch
I'm goin’ prime time, I'm on my slime time
I'm goin’ hard, these niggas know I'm on my grind time
See, I want Bow Wow baby mama
I keep it real, she look good, I'll okay the drama
Yo, listen ma', you made a rhymer, and a state to state shiner
Money tall, shit, I ball like the wall of great China
I love money, if you love money, touch it, more karats in my jewellery than Bugs Bunny stomach
What's poppin’, nigga?
