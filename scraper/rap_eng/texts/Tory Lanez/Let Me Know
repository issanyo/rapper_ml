[Verse 1]
Uh, you got your own list of problems
And really I can't do shit to solve 'em
Wanna hit a nigga up like, "Why you dissin'?"
Well this time, I ain't got time so girl, dismiss it
Kissin' on your neck, you be givin' that disrespect
Until I give you this dick up in your chest
And you hit me like, "Damn bae, damn bae
That shit feel so damn great"
Start confessin', you so weak
That you can't even stand straight
Start again, arguin', talkin' 'bout you can't stand me
Like I don't understand you and you don't understand me
Damn girl, my head hurt, need to stop that for your man's sake
And you walk up out that door and slap me like a hand shake, damn

[Chorus]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you
Hopin' that you thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
Just let me know, just let me know
Just let me know, just let me know

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you be comin' 'round with all that cussin'
We can have a conversation but damn, what's with all that fussin'?
What's worse is you used to call a nigga your husband
Guess I ain't that man no more
I guess I relly ain't in your plans no more
But damn you cold and damn you know
And damn you so and now you know
Make me wanna take my hands and oh
But I ain't gon' do that 'cause I ain't gon' do that
Say you gotta man well, I already knew that
Well I'll be in the new back 'cause I ain't takin' you back
Already been through that and I ain't tryna do that
Places I be racin' though with laces, I won't lace you though
Amazin' how a relationship can go from a yes to a blatant no , no
Well it's amazin' what the brain can know
'Cause the dumb motherfucker that'll stick around any longer is the same motherfucker you mistake me for, damn girl

[Chorus]
Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you, thinkin' 'bout you
Hopin' that you thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
Just let me know, just let me know
Just let me know, just let me know
Oh let me know, let me know
Oh let me know, let me know
Oh let me know, let me know
Oh let me know, let me know
Just let me know
Baby girl, I'm thinkin' 'bout ya
Please don't leave me outchea
All alone
I can't leave you
I can't leave you alone
Girl, let me know, let me know
Oh girl, let me know, let me know
Oh, let me know, let me know
Oh, let me know, let me know, oh
