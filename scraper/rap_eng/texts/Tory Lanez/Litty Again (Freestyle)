[Verse]
And it goes on
Kill a pussy nigga with his pantyhose on
The gun is equipped for what ever hand it goes on
To kill a backpack nigga with his Jansport on
Geek ass nigga
Dweeb ass nigga
Never had a G-pass nigga
'Bout to ski mask his ass and eat fast nigga
Pull the heat fast and blast
And leave that nigga
With his seat back nigga
I'm a number one nigga in no time
I been waiting for a nigga to give me the showtime
In the jungle waiting for you to slip on the oak vine
I'ma do this nigga like I was chewing a pork rind nigga
Eminem couldn't get ya to a million on the 'Gram
Chris Brown tried, nigga failed both times
I done took ya page to a million in a day
If you ask me, nigga, I'm ya motherfucking cosign
I'ma hit the pussy ass nigga with a clothesline
I'ma have to catch a nigga slipping in my own time
I just took the flame on a private ass plane
Out to Massachusetts, catch this nigga slipping in his hometown
Ya see what go around come around and go around
So I got his hoe going round like it go around
Let these niggas know I'm not the one to toe-to-toe around
Singing ass nigga not the one to leave your hoe around
I'm about to hit him with the end of the K
Word to my niggas in Heaven I'm 'bout to send em away
I'm exhausted I kill this nigga two times
24 hours man this shit been a repetitive day
Nigga tell me is it Joyner Lucas, Lucas Joyner?
I'm the nigga who destroy ya
Coupe deploy ya, label drop ya, who's the lawyer?
Buy ya contract from them back and be who employ ya
Oops, I'm going, who's condoning? Juice and jonesing
Met ya bitch she too conjointed
Tryna ask this pussy ass nigga who the fuck want smoke
But the lightskin niggas in ya crew too spooked to join in
I'm a nasty nigga, then you could ask these nigga
The shotty dumping popping up outta the backseat, nigga
I'm 'bout to leave his body bloody like a maxi, nigga
I tax these niggas, get at these niggas, attack these niggas
The venom is arachne, nigga
I'm 'bout kill da man and da man that done backed these niggas
And blam any man that'll try to dap you niggas
And clap any stan fan that attract you niggas
See ya daddy was a musician that never made  it
'Cause when you was born nigga it was you or him
Shattered knowing he would never make it as an artist
And the odds of his life prolly be 2 to 1
But I give it to him 'cause he didn't run
I guess he figured, "man when you look at it in a nutshell
All I got is a failed music career and
My revenge is giving that shit to my son"
Nigga I'ma flossy nigga
They try to toss me nigga
The 45th I get em off me nigga
I block niggas Chris Bosh these niggas
I got figures pish posh to niggas
I dump niggas, jump, criss cross these niggas
The pump leave 'em slumped, in the car seat nigga
The skunk in the trunk was an awkward nigga
That thought he didn't need to have caution with him
A cornball with a Boston fitted
I said hold up my nigga man this shit crazy
You fucked AYLEK$ man that shit crazy
Nigga said he out here running threesomes with the
Nigga that's in court dealing with the kid cases
I'ma hit a stain then I hit a bad one
Pull up on the nigga hold em up for ransom
I got five plaques this year, you did a whole song with Eminem and still don't even have one nigga
Damn, my lil homie that’s a bad one nigga
Really feel bad for you it's a sad one nigga
Hold your head steady maybe you could have one nigga
Hit me for a hook and maybe get a plaque young nigga
Shout go out to Wayno and Ak my nigga
Tomorrow they'll be talking 'bout you got smacked young nigga
From the pack my nigga
I'm keeping this shit a stack, my nigga
That "Litty" verse was wack, my nigga
They go hard my dawg, but I go harder nigga
Atcha head with the fade like a barber nigga
Try to come for the boat and I'ma harbor niggas
Be smart like a Harvard nigga don't start with niggas
And he got a problem with us
But nigga, I know how to solve it nigga
This is my son
I'ma tell 'em like Star Wars, "Lucas, I am your father" nigga
You a perpetrating, work for hire, twerk for payment
Busta Rhyme impersonating, worthless baby, irks him daily
Hurts to say it, burger flipping, birthed in 80s
Tryna be a 90s baby, thirty something tryna chase it
Tryna make it, rocks designer, kinda fakes it
Hates to face it
That he'll never be a nigga that be placed for A-list, niggas damn
Here's what he's thinking right now
"I'm Joyner Lucas, why did I start it with this guy?
Tory Lanez coming back what am I gonna do this time?
They ain't like none of my diss lines
Everybody knows I can spit it in quick time
Even if the lines is as shitty as 6ix9ine's
But this time they ain’t really letting me get by
Fuck I'm finna do with this shit now?
Damn I know this nigga finna be wild
Knowin' this nigga bout to kill me on it OD now
Don't nobody ever wanna book me for a show
I ain't got no songs when I go I spit freestyles
Try to make songs 'bout depression
But nobody ever get it
So I take it out on popping niggas beats now
I ain't never ever trapped
I ain't never slung a gat
But the world don't know so fuck it, I'm a G now"
Man, what the fuck wrong with him?
I know something wrong with him
I got a hundred bunch o' bullets 'bout to put 'em all in him
Nigga walked in with a hundred rounds in him
And he's seen a nigga chicken I was comin' down in it
Glock nine nigga gotta run around with it
I'ma son a nigga, keep it at least one-a-round with it
Backpack niggas ain't sellin' no records
Better dumb it down with it when you come around with it

[Outro]
This shit is easy man
Yo it's crazy nigga
I'm really-, I'm really-, I'm really being very generous, you know?
Like I'm really doing you a favor, it's not a lot of niggas in my status that come down just to, you know, to come down and spank you niggas, pause man
It's crazy, but you know
I'ma do for you what niggas didn't do for me - that's older brother status
So if you blow from this point on, I'm your cosign nigga, you know what it is
Ayy Slow, that's facts right?
Big facts, word to Ralph, nigga, word to big Jevante too, nigga
You know what's going on nigga-, you know what the fuck's going on, nigga
One Umbrella gang, nigga
