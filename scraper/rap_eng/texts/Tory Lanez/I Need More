[Intro]
Yeah, I said
Girl I think I need more
Looking at you over there, I can't help myself
Girl I think I need more

[Verse 1]
Yeah, usually I'm not worried
But there is something that is about you like Mary
And I need a lil time, maybe piece of mind
Know I got that cake and she can get a piece of mine
But that ain't what you want, you's a good girl
So is it bad I wanna treat your body good girl?
All of yo friends say that you should girl
Just give me a chance boo you gotta understand

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
No we ain't been together that long, you wanna take it slow but, girl I think I need more
Tryna play it cool just can't ignore, girl I think I need more
So give it all you got and I'mma give it to yo body
Say you never been like this before, but girl I think I need more

[Verse 2]
Usually I don't do this
Girl you bad as Judas, saying know yo swag is stupid
Worth a million, a billion, body look cicillian
Know I got that pencil baby, you should let me fill it in
I say it loud, audible voice
My paper out, multiple choice
But I ain't got no question for ya, oh, except shawty can I get to know ya?
Can I get closer, closer than close up?
We belong like a toaster to my holster come on
Girl, you shining with the light out
And you know I'll beat it right out
'Til the sheets look like some white out

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Let's do something you ain't use too
Spend the night so it don't feel like I used you
It's no reason to be hesitant
I said I'm ready girl, go get a oven mitt
Ha I know I be on some other shit
Might take charge, but I can cover it
You haunted by the niggas in yo past
But all I can envision is me gripping on yo ass
So come right over here and give me what I want
Do some of do things you tell them other niggas that you want
I swear you got a coke body shake it up you could explode
Body saying yes but yo mind saying no

[Chorus]
