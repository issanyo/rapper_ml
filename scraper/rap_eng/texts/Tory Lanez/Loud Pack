[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Keep you on my side like the loud pack
Baby where you been?
Dipping in a Benz
Need you right beside me like the loud pack
Party with your friends
Bring 'em to the crib
It's all good with me, I got the loud pack
Bring it to the crib, you know what it is
We gon' get it lit, just like the loud pack
And I'm with the shits
Pull up with ah stick
Pull up, light the motherfucking loud pack

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
I got two bitches and they fucking, oh yeah
Soon as you see me, you know what I'm on, yeah
New Lamborghini, that trunk in the front, yeah
Loud pack
Dipping in the 'gatti, baby
You still got a body, baby
You still riding shotty with the loud pack
And it ain't a thing to her
I can pull your main bitch and all I do is sing to her
(Yeah-yeah-yeah-oh)
Lil T the one to tease me, want the whole thing
Still whipping and the digits long as lo mein
Whipping on the side, I'ma...

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Keep you on my side like the loud pack
Baby where you been?
Dipping in a Benz
Need you right beside me like the loud pack
Party with your friends
Bring 'em to the crib
It's all good with me, I got the loud pack
Bring it to the crib, you know what it is
We gon' get it lit, just like the loud pack
And I'm with the shits
Pull up with ah stick
Pull up, light the motherfucking loud pack

[Verse 2: Dave East]
We go to Cali smoking Cali, this shit loud
Backwood on fire, so got my eyes low, blow this pound
First class, I don't do no more coach
When I was broke I still had smoke
That blunt not done, I hit that roach
Got two bitches and they smoking out
We don't know no drought
I can show you what this dough about
I woke up on a cloud, Takeoff
My diamonds Offset
Got her number, ain't called yet
Lambo, the trunk in front of it, pulling up, I ain't parked yet
On Collins couple Haitians close
Honestly we take jewelry better than we can take a joke
Got the head off a eighth of dope
Came back to the crib, back to the face, I ain't passing it
Before I used to package it
All the smokin', I mastered it, loud

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Keep you on my side like the loud pack
Baby where you been?
Dipping in a Benz
Need you right beside me like the loud pack
Party with your friends
Bring 'em to the crib
It's all good with me, I got the loud pack
Bring it to the crib, you know what it is
We gon' get it lit, just like the loud pack
And I'm with the shits
Pull up with ah stick
Pull up, light the motherfucking loud pack
