[Intro]
Misunderstood ain't gotta be sad
Understand my language, let's air these niggas out
Canada, you know they tell me never break your promises and I won't

[Verse]
And I promise this shit could really get ugly, life is a joy
Deep water rap, this shit is Tyson and Floyd
I'm ringsidin' for niggas that been quiet
Fly nigga enter buildin', we Bin Laden
This is for the bum ass bitches that's dick ridin'
And this is for them numb ass niggas that's been plottin'
I been hotter than all of these young niggas
So why the fuck are they pullin' me back and I'm slingshottin'?
The wall, y'all niggas ain't ballin' with tall figures
I do this shit for the city, I'm doin' it outta duty
And killin' the instrumental and doin' it outta pity
Why haters are tryna knock me and bitches is out to get me
This is what I signed up for
I admire all them people outside in that line up for
I'm the reason why these younger niggas tryna abort
Tell 'em get it, tell 'em get it 'til their time up, boy
Please, niggas hate the numbers and they fear addition
But they love you when you broke and you in their position
Just beware when your nigga in love with bigger bossin'
'Cause that same nigga lovin' be that nigga crossin'
Pickin' duckin' the visions of bigger budgets
We ignore haters and all them niggas they fuck with
They the same suckers that run and tell you they love you
As soon as you turn your back, they be tellin' lies to the public
Well uh, tell your lies, tell your lies, tell your lies, nigga
Just makin' sure you don't end up tellin' to my niggas
Ready for war, we talk machetes and swords
And throw you a celebration, we got confetti galore
I'm ready, like a runner that's only racin' for willin'
These niggas is mad at me, I'm only makin' a killin'
It's history in the makin', I gotta make it appealin'
And Shawn made me a star and I gotta make him a million
A couple shows over, I'm in my own quota
I play the boss and the counci,l I own Yoda
You might tell I'm like Kell with that orange soda
I make you niggas hoes sit at your own yoga
Gettin' money 'til the day when I can feel awareness
I can tell my time comin', I can feel it's madness
Know it's comin', know it's comin' like I know these nigga
Knowin' money, blowin' money, I'm so fuckin' careless
Never judge me for the shit that I say on the record
I'm double stackin' like the king when you playin' in checkers
I run rap now so young back down
Because I'm way too high to come back down

[Outro]
Sincerely. Put the money in the duffel, That's the answer to the problem. It's Tory
