[Hook]
You wanna get me for this money, I say no
I can't worry about you haters, gotta grind and get my buck
So God, give me a halo, and I made it, though
When the sun low, I pray to God, give me a halo and I made it, though
When the sun is low

[Verse 1]
In the fast, I get my …
I done been up in this bitch way too long
Thinking I ain't getting none of your shit
It ain't nothing that I want I won't go get
…I'm the king of whatever, I say it again
You niggas nothing in the game so play it again
Got my eyes on the prize, away in the wind
You niggas lost already, I'm waiting to win
I got my aim on, tryna get a new sight
Haters know the truth so I'm here to get on new sights
…you don't like me 'cause I'm probably something you not
Your hustle cool but see my hustle greener
Hate the stubborns, see, I love the haters
They don't fuck with me and I don't fuck with them
I get a bitch, I let her play with this paper
…I need the hate low while I run this paper

[Hook]
You wanna get me for this money, I say no
I can't worry about you haters, gotta grind and get my buck
So God, give me a halo, and I made it, though
When the sun low, I pray to God, give me a halo and I made it, though
When the sun is low

[Verse 2]
Can't quit so I know I gotta finish now
I need a halo, father can't see me now
…
I'm too real to be, I'm too real to be
You ain't real as me
How you figure that, how you figure that
…yeah, I gotta get this money, can't lose focus
…I shine for real so every one of them notice
Got no bricks, how you niggas gonna stop it?
Hating on me better try to get a profit
If it ain't that, what the fuck is you doing?
Keep playing, I'mma pull a broke nigga outta pocket
…hunting for the green like a savage

[Hook]
You wanna get me for this money, I say no
I can't worry about you haters, gotta grind and get my buck
So God, give me a halo, and I made it, though
When the sun low, I pray to God, give me a halo and I made it, though
When the sun is low
