[Intro]
Aw yeah, winner of the year, baby
Swavey

[Chorus]
This everythin' I ever wanted, oh
I let that beat drop queen on your ass, nigga
Remember nights I used to feed for this cash, nigga
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
Everythin' I ever wanted

[Verse 1]
Need to flaunt it, but never seen it honest
My European mami probably on a job, nigga
I ain't gon' lie, I'm with some breezies at the spot, nigga
Went to car dealers to niggas from sippin' malt liquor
Damn, that feelin', feelin' better than the feelin' before
Shout out to Fresco on the brillo, we did it, we blow
My middle finger to them haters, you can take your picture
I let the instrumental paint the picture, Swavey
My game doper than a king smoker
Your favourite artist might be dope but I remain doper
I seen those rappers lane over 'cause your lane over
That's lames for ya, dame over in my Range Rover
Guess I'm just super fly when I'm super duper high
I be runnin' circles with the swave, hoola hoop or fly
I'm on the apex, might lose on my iText
How could you be flyin', you ain't even learn to fly yet? Swavey

[Chorus]
I let that beat drop queen on your ass, nigga
Remember nights I used to feed for this cash, nigga
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted

[Verse 2]
I'm on mic, 1, 2, cuffers they want you
Haters all just confused, lovers they love you
But just don't wanna show it, so much that they keep it
Hold it inside they soul and roll it
Envy emotions that a hater try to keep inside
Be shoutin', "Nigga, don't watch me" but they be peepin' right
I set the standard so high, these is what the beaches like
Paid my security nigga, so I don't need to fight, hand me my mirror back
I'm in my tuxedo, Rolls Royce that bought Rigo
Reup, reload, the books we throw
The clubs be sold, you know, you know, 2 doors, 2 hoes
So 2 doughs to you niggas takin' pictures with your new folk
A fantasy stuntin' in them Phantom seats
Everyone who hated regret it, Loyota lookin'
I'm still amazin', still I made it through the buckets of rubbish
So motherfuck it, it's done sucker, we comin' before the game

[Chorus]
I let that beat drop queen on your ass, nigga
Remember nights I used to feed for this cash, nigga
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted

[Outro]
This a public service announcement, remindin' you to keep it swavey at all times, baby. I mean it's not flockin' if it's not flockin', think about it. We rockin' clothes we can't pronounce, man. I need an accent to announce what I'm wearin' right now. Swavey, never rugged, nigga. Ow. I mean if I see you sideline hatin' because my pavement worth more than your faces, na I mean, I understand. And I ain't tryna stunt or nothin', I'm just keepin' it 100 with the thugs of the youngin's. 'Cause some buggin' got your main girl want me. I mean I might just take her, treat her to some makeup and a lil bit of extra bacon. After that, we shake it, she probably gon' get naked. Oh yeah, Fresco

[Chorus]
I let that beat drop queen on your ass, nigga
Remember nights I used to feed for this cash, nigga
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
And got me feelin' like oh la la la la
This everythin' I ever wanted
Oh la la la la, woo, baby
Oh la la la la, woo, baby
Oh la la la la, woo, baby
Oh la la la la, woo, baby, swavey
