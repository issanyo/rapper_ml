[Intro]
We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard

[Verse 1]
Y'all niggas done heard about this right?
But you ain't never heard it sound this good
I'm straight, the whip good, the liq good
It's just hood
Same niggas yellin' out, "Fuck me"
Are probably mad 'cause they bitch would
A nigga hold that spot, you can blow my cock
Like the mother fuckin' tip good
Tip trill. shit real
You can get it on for the day right
Yeah, she'll get it on if the pay right
Yeah, she'll put it all in the face like
Like blood to a great white
Like a thug on a late night
Like the snub to the face of a chum
Gettin' mugged by a thug in the daylight
I'll be on the road to the fly shit
So we don't have time for the games
And all these hoes on my dick
Really tryna ride for the fame
So what we gon' to do Jay?
Should we let 'em ride? Let 'em hang?
Hell naw, nigga F them hoes
Shit we got plenty more, we can let them go

[Chorus]
Ain't gotta believe in me if you don't
You can think whatever you want
You can doubt it, I'm about it
You'll see soon, you'll see soon
I swear I'm headed to the moon
I got these people goin' dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Fuckin' stupidio
Oh yes they go dumb, they go dumb, they go dumb, they go dumb
It's fuckin' stupido, dumb

[Verse 2]
One way trip to the moon, aw nigga, don't trill
'Cause house and the whip coming too, aw nigga, don't flail
'Cause we already did that, we done left here and we been back
And the best here, we done been that and shit, y'all know what it is
So why y'all play like it ain't? Play like it ain't?
Nigga I ain't sayin' what it ain't
But I know you think it's lies from the cars you drive t
To the money you claim in the bank
Yeah, motherfucker
Bet on the stand, I'm the man, motherfucker
Roll with some niggas that'll blam on suckas
Beach house, put you in the sand motherfucker
'Cause I'm stayin' on top, like tans on niggas
See I am what I am, a nigga, damn on a man
And I need a outta state chick with some fake tits, nigga, Pamala Anne
Are you still on my dick? Damn nigga, scram
Y'll niggas can't hang with an ape, I don't care y'all say, I'll damage your man

[Chorus]
Ain't gotta believe in me if you don't
You can think whatever you want
You can doubt it, I'm about it
You'll see soon, you'll see soon
I swear I'm headed to the moon
I got these people goin' dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb, dumb
Fuckin' stupidio
Oh yes they go dumb, they go dumb, they go dumb, they go dumb
It's fuckin' stupido, dumb

[Outro]
So young, lil nigga go dumb
So young, lil nigga go dumb
So young, that lil nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, y'all make a nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, y'all make a nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, y'all make a nigga go dumb
So young, don't make the nigga go dumb
So young, lil nigga go dumb
