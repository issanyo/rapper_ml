[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Oohhh

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I’m rolled up, I’m poured up
I want you, and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up

[Verse 1: Trav]
I’m on like a light switch
I like my bitches to like bitches
I be your man or your side nigga
Long as I get time to vibe with you
I just wanna chill and get high with you, high with you
Long as you know that you my nigga
I would ride and die for you
Long as I get time to vibe with you, high with you
I just want to chill and get high with you, high with you
Shawty just met me, say she love me
She don't really, really know me
She goin’ to make me turn back to the ol’ me
‘Cause she ride the dick like a jet ski
Pussy so good, fell in love with it
Fuck the bitch once, she in love with me
I don't be bitchin’ or buggin’
[?] or fussin’
That’s just a dove to me
When I’m wit you, it's a great vibe
Come alive in the night time
I pour an 8 in a Fanta, [?] dirty danca

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I’m rolled up, I’m poured up
I want you, and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up

[Verse 2: Belly]
Yeah, yeah
[?] you don't really understand it
I know this shit lookin’ like I planned it
Lately everything I hit, lately, I can’t miss
Put your true colors on my canvas
Aye, I still drive a foreign, my car is autorise (bonjour)
My plug worth a billion and still drive a Taurus
I still fuck with Goldie, she come for the porridge
I freeze it, I pour it, I used to keep it and store it
I’m stash kis in the storage, I know they comin’ for us
I’m bracin’ for it like forest, ink in my pores
Tattoos of Horace I told her my batch is the purest (it is)
I've been driftin’ like the ralley (skrrt), trips to Bali just to [?]
Plug’s from Mexicali Valley, made 10 million shouts to Sally (Sally)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I’m rolled up, I’m poured up
I want you, and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
I’m rolled up (I’m rolled up), I’m poured up (I’m poured up)
I want you (I want you), and you know what’s up
