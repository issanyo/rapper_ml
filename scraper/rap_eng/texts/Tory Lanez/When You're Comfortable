[Intro]
Ayo, Ciravo, man
I done talked to like 10 of my producers
And none of them can make this beat
So I'm gon' make it myself
Let's try somethin' out man
Let's just beat box it out
Like the old school days
Swavey

[Verse 1]
You know you fine with them Hello Kitty PJ's on
And when you walkin' in the room, girl, you ain't even wrong
You got your hair twirled down to the side, babe
And love to brush it when you talkin' on your Skype, babe
Ooh girl, won't you let me see it?
Let me come over when you layin' in the Vicky Secrets
Said I been feenin' all day, won't you let me beep it?
And we ain't gotta tell nobody, it's our little secret

[Chorus]
You say you ain't dressed up
But you ain't gotta dress up
And when you got no make up on
Girl, I just wanna take you on
'Cause she got that T-shirt on with the slides
Rock the swim pants with the hair tied
So got her Uggs on, on the phone
Girl, you're so comfortable and fly
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
You're comfortable, girl
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
You're comfortable, girl
I love it when you're comfortable, girl

[Interlude]
Hol' up, now this one is strictly for the ladies
Let me ask y'all somethin'

[Verse 2]
I said do you, do you, do you like to be comfortable?
I said do you, do you, do you like to be comfortable?

[Chorus]
'Cause she got that T-shirt on with the slides
Rock the swim pants with the hair tie
She got her Uggs on, on the phone
Girl, you're so comfortable and fly
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
You're comfortable, girl
I love it when you're comfortable, girl
You're comfortable, girl
I love it when you're comfortable, girl

[Outro]
Baby, yeah, Swavey, baby
There's nothin' better than you when you're comfortable, baby
Remember that
Well uh, we gon' sign off, this has been a Lanez creation
Produced by Lanez
