[Intro]
It's a lot of it nigga
Oh so your old ass don't wanna smoke with a nigga?
I got weed
It's a lot of it nigga
Yea, uh

[Verse]
Nigga we made it
Niggas get jealous
The owner can't tell us shit nigga we paid it
Look at the picture we painted
My shit make your shit get repainted
My nigga I'm faded, S-O to pay me
Cause this year I promise they got it we take it
Fuck all them bitches that hated
Last year I got lazy cause nigga we mofucking made it
No I ain't giving out favors
If niggas is talking then dissing is cool
Cause this year ain't no nigga my neighbor
It's hundreds I'm running
I eat with Armenian niggas that get to that paper
I'm back on the road with a four and a baby
So baby just hit up my pager, nigga I'm major
This shit was a movie, I took her for sushi
My kick is front Louie, my chick outta truly
Your bitches are groupies, one of Wasatcha
My nigga book me the flight
I was gon' book her the ticket to fuck her
But it only took me one night and I damn near
Head in a Porsche I crashed the Panamera
I ain't got a damn care cause I'm the man in here
Walking with the metal cause the mofucking devil
Ain't playing it fair, I throw a damn chair
Liquor and the weed got me looking like a nigga with a blank stare
I'm in the bank yeah, every time I step up in your city
I'm the nigga getting banked out, I said I said it before
She getting me high but give me head on the low
I been getting the dough but really getting it though
Got the KDE moving and that's a cheddar to go
I b-redded flow enough finesse on the low
You can never nigga when I'm coming all up in it
Niggas talk money but it's funny to me
They don't see me like the car tinted
(Ah!) Everything I'm doing gotta have an R in it
Audemar, Audecar, authentic
The streets wanna know why you and Drizzy Drake
Ain't been doing no features
I'm not for the answers the only thing I am is ready when he is
In living Jesus I nailed 'em my keeper to help me spit ether
My women let Bellevard√© spill on designer they know I got cleaners
Fuck with me shawty, if it ain't me then who else?
We learned it from early don't bite off the hand
That's gon' feed you some wealth
Killer on the street, I preach and I repeat
No slip I sleep, I creep with my heat
Ice deep, even on my street with my peep the nigga might try pre-or
Got off a tour, 'bout to go hop on another one
Tell a fuck nigga to fall back (Yup!)
Just like the summer done
Said it when I was eleven when I put the pen into the pad
Like Paramedic Pat, now we pull up pressing [?]
We done took an interception
Jugging in a cooking section, niggas took it that you took a lesson
But I didn't [?]
And you know the mofucka in the hood
Rapping like a mofucking hood reverend
