[Pre-Chorus]
Look at my old hoes, say no no no no
Look at my old friends that used to be down and around
Look at you all now, could I be dumb?

[Chorus]
Oh no 'cause I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Ridin' round town with these lame ass niggas
Oh, no no no, no
Sweatin' myself for these lame ass bitches
Oh, no no no, no
Fargo ridin' around in a drop top
I’m like I’m not, I’m not, I’m not, I'm not

[Verse 1]
I ain't talkin' 'bout you, no, this shit all 'bout you
Rumors, they all were true, they all were true
Hope it ain't all 'bout you
Hopin' they wrong, expect it from all but you
But I know you got old
I know you got old
I know what you got is cool
I just wish I knew, I just wish I knew

[Chorus]
Oh no 'cause I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Ridin' round town with these lame ass niggas
Oh, no no no, no
Sweating myself for these lame ass bitches
Oh, no no no, no
Fargo ridin' around in a drop-top
I’m like I’m not, I’m not, I’m not, I'm not

[Verse 2]
I ain't talkin' 'bout us, no, this shit ain't 'bout us
No, this shit ain't 'bout trust, it ain't enough
If I do my thing in the club
If I do my thing don't judge, no no don't judge
'Cause you be out doin' your thing, don't you say you don't get around
Drop top ,whippin' down collins, don't ask why I'm all alone
Don't ask why I cannot trust these niggas
Both girls and guys they lie that's why I

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at my old hoes, say no no no no
Look at my old friends that used to be down and around
Look at you all now, could I be dumb?

[Chorus]
Oh no 'cause I'm not, I'm not, I'm not
Ridin' round town with these lame ass niggas
Oh, no no no, no
Sweating myself for these lame ass bitches
Oh, no no no, no
Fargo ridin' around in a drop-top
I’m like I’m not, I’m not, I’m not, I'm not
