[Verse 1: Stevie Davis]
I'm tryna ride witchu
Peep the passenger side and just let me ride witchu
We be passing the sky when I'm gettin' high witchu
Young nigga, once I'm done with you, let me stump witchu
Let me rump-pa-pump-pa-pump the place and shake the bass, to shake your waist
She breakin' necks and cashin' cheques
And after next, cause after all, we have it all
It's time to bone, no time for time now cause the times now
And if right now, I'm high now
Just to be right down, my mind out
Find out, everything seems alive now
Yeah, you wouldn't better lie, all I'm trying to do is satisfy
So exotic and you know I got it
So lets get it and girl I'm feeling so alive

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Ride around this coupe exotic, all I wanna do is you
Shawty know you got it, so excited plus you want it bad as I do, yeah
I'm aboutta roll up outta, roll with me, you know I know, I got it
Say anything you need, you fuck with me

[Chorus: Tory Lanez] x2
I'm on my way
Shawty tell a nigga that you are about it (My way)
Take her to the crib (Inaudible) (My way)
Tell a young nigga that you a freak though (My way)
I'm ballin' on them niggas with a free throw

[Verse 2: Stevie Davis]
And I know that you be waiting on the weekend
So we can, kick it for the evening
Couldn't even see us until I started believing
I ain't never had this fear
Can you tell me what's the meaning?
I've been meaning to tell you how much you mean to me
When I'm witcha, the definition is being free
At your service with these bars, AT&T
Keep it simple just a star, A B and C
Take me and see

[Hook: Stevie Davis]
I'm on my way
When I get to shawty, I want my way
I can't guarantee that I'm gunna stay
But tonight, I'm thinking (Inaudible)
Put it all up on the table
I've been watchin' you like cable
Come on shawty, let me save you
Find somewhere that you'll be safe and sound

[Verse 3: Stevie Davis]
Gotta get me some
On a mission like Mother Teresa, lovin' the peace
Gotta listen when I'm all in your speakers, follow the beat
Paintin' pictures, Mona Lisa (Finch)
Just to back (Inaudible)
UNFMLR, that's the movement
(Inaudible) wanna feature

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Ride around this coupe exotic, all I wanna do is you
Shawty know you got it, so excited plus you want it bad as I do, yeah
I'm aboutta roll up outta, roll with me, you know I know, I got it
Say anything you need, you fuck with me

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I'm on my way
Shawty tell a nigga that you are about it (My way)
Take her to the crib (Inaudible) (My way)
Tell a young nigga that you a freak though (My way)
I'm ballin' on them niggas with a free throw (I'm on my way)
Shawty tell a nigga that you are about it (My way)
Take her to the crib (Inaudible) (My way)
Tell a young nigga that you a freak though (My way)
I'm ballin' on them niggas with a free throw, baby
