[Intro: Pressa]
Uh, uh, na-na-naa
Uh, uh, na-na-naa

[Chorus: Pressa]
Canada goose fur, I'm so cold burr (fur, burr)
Back to school shopping, I just bought a ruler (thirty)
I'm a shooter, I'ma shoot first (bla, bla)
I done fucked up and got me in a cruiser (woo, woo, woo)
Mercedes-Benz coupe, ring a ice cube (Benz coupe, ice cube)
Live my life so fast, ain't telling what I might do (might do)
He want smoke blow, 45 colt (bla, bla)
It's a ISO, A.I, Michael (bla, Jordan)

[Verse 1: Pressa]
I talk a lot of shit 'cause I could back it (up)
Got my dick in her throat watch her back it (suck)
I'm all about my bread like a fat kid
I'm all about my swag like its fashion
And I'm super savage, grew up as the bad kid (bad kid)
My niggas on your block, call it camping (camping)
They don't want no static (la, la, la, la)
Pull up let 'em have it (bow, bow, bow, bow)
Killers in the first-degree (first-degree)
Uh, a lot of niggas wanna murder me (murder me)
Ayy, so I got a glizzy (ayy, ayy)
Turn him over like he Timothy (Turner)

[Chorus: Pressa]
Canada goose fur, I'm so cold burr (fur, burr)
Back to school shopping, I just bought a ruler (thirty)
I'm a shooter, I'ma shoot first (bla, bla)
I done fucked up and got me in a cruiser (woo, woo, woo)
Mercedes-Benz coupe, ring a ice cube (Benz coupe, ice cube)
Live my life so fast, ain't telling what I might do (might do)
He want smoke blow, 45 colt (bla, bla)
It's a ISO, A.I, Michael (Jordan)

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Tory, uh
Bang, let it bang, let it shoot (woo)
Hit a stain while I'm laying out the coupe (coupe)
With Somalis and they down to let it shoot
Do do do do do, I clock the pussy on a roof (ha)
From the dot where we known to let it go (go)
My niggas they gon' make a hole up at the door (ayy)
Her mama trip I fucked her in the Bando
She said she like the way my wrist is whippin' on the stove (whip, whip)
With no answer
To bring my nigga Nesta back I pay the bands up (I pay the bands)
I catch his killer, have a real extravaganza (extravaganz)
Yeah that's my plan, this rappin' shit won't fuck my plans up (woo)
No, uh-uh, in the goose fur, with the shooters (goose, shoot)
Wanna meet the President, you gotta fuck the bang bros and the crew first (first)
I know the truth hurts (ah)
Not only that I got some niggas tryna line me (line)
They wanna find me (find)
Nobody help me when I came up so I'm grimey
So many niggas wanna see me out and fly me
I tell 'em, "run up pussy, try me" (try me, pussy)
Tell 'em, "run up pussy, find me" (find me)
I been in the Dodge with some killers right behind me
I remember days when them bitches weren't beside me
I remember in the corner cooking up the 9-piece

[Verse 3: Pressa]
I give it all up, to see my man back
I brought a mop instead, to see my opps dead
I see the same fed, I knew I clocked it
Studio trappin', just for content
'Cause I don't know what they have at the border (border)
All this good mixin' bad, feelin' bipolar (bipolar)
If the feds on my tail, I start to floor her (zoom)
Big chain on my belly, fuck a choker (fuck a choker)
Came up off of homers, junkies sleeping over
Friday boomin' but Sunday's little slower (slower)
Trappin' was a hobby, Honda was the car key (trap)
8 hunnid for this Monclees

[Chorus: Pressa]
Canada goose fur, I'm so cold burr (fur, burr)
Back to school shopping, I just bought a ruler (thirty)
I'm a shooter, I'ma shoot first (bla, bla)
I done fucked up and got me in a cruiser (woo, woo, woo)
Mercedes-Benz coupe, ring a ice cube (Benz coupe, ice cube)
Live my life so fast, ain't telling what I might do (might do)
He want smoke blow, 45 colt (bla, bla)
It's a ISO, A.I, Michael (bla, Jordan)

[Outro: Pressa]
Big chain on my belly, fuck a choker
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
