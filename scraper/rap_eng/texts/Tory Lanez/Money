[Chorus]
Imma throw some money to the sky, oh yeah (yeah)
Imma be finessin’ ’til I die, oh yeah (yeah)
We gon’ fuck around for the night, oh yeah
O-o-oh yeah (yeah), Mmm
Imma throw some money to the sky, oh yeah (yeah)
Imma be finessin’ ’til I die, oh yeah (yeah)
We gon’ fuck around for the night, oh yeah
O-o-oh yeah

[Verse 1]
I bet you didn't know now
My cheques come with six 0's now
Been spending time on the road now
Miss you when I'm alone
You know I do
Baby don't act like you don't know this
My late night game the coldest
I let you bend me like a lotus
If you can wait it out, when I'm in town
I'm all for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you so Hollywood
Pay em all dust
Cos
Basic is an epidemic all around us
And you know it
You would choose it
When I need it
That's some bullshit

[Chorus]
Imma throw some money to the sky, oh yeah (yeah)
Imma be finessin’ ’til I die, oh yeah (yeah)
We gon’ fuck around for the night, oh yeah
O-o-oh yeah (yeah), o-oh (um)
Imma throw some money to the sky, oh yeah (yeah)
Imma be finessin’ ’til I die, oh yeah (yeah)
We gon’ fuck around for the night, oh yeah
O-o-oh yeah (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I heard you got a new place
I'm right at home on yo face
My flight is in the AM
I'm tryna break you off before then
Baby don't act like you don't pose it
Lick me down like I'm a postage
Yeah pop it, baby toast it
That's looking like I want
You know I do, uhh ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
And you so Hollywood
Pay em all dust
Cos
Basic is an epidemic all around us
And you know it
You would choose it
When I need it
That's some bullshit

[Chorus]
Imma throw some money to the sky, oh yeah (yeah)
Imma be finessin’ ’til I die, oh yeah (yeah)
We gon’ fuck around for the night, oh yeah
O-o-oh yeah (yeah), o-oh (um)
Imma throw some money to the sky, oh yeah (yeah)
Imma be finessin’ ’til I die, oh yeah (yeah)
We gon’ fuck around for the night, oh yeah
O-o-oh yeah (yeah)
