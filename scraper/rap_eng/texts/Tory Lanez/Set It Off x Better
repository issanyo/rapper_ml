Set It Off

[Verse 1]
Rollin' up, Iâ€™ll do you proper
Parked the Benz all in the plaza
Smokin' that lava, smokin' it loudly
Every time we fuck you be moaning and wildin'
Liftin' your leg up, shit gettin' wetter
Fuckin' so long that I'm fuckin' my bread up
Spend the whole night just to get this shit settled
And you got it set up

[Hook]
'Fore we set it off
We done talked and we set it off
I'ma fuck, you just set it off
So fuck me and set it off
Fuck me, set if off
We done talked and we set it off
I'ma fuck, you just set it off
So fuck me and set it off

[Verse 2]
Grabbin' on a nigga designer
I'm tryna find you, girl, you a diamond
Bad breed, bad gyal, throw that Rihanna
Swear the whole world can hate as long as we shinin'
You know I spend days on that corner, we grindin'
You was there before the days when a nigga was grimey
You so good at scopin' out a nigga that wanna line me
Put me in the house with 5-0 tryna find me
Girl, I'm on the Wi-Fi so I'm fuckin' you wildly
Girl, I'm from the dot so I'm fuckin' you wildly
Put it in the spot, got you moanin' and wildin'
Shawty close the door and just fuck me in silence

[Hook]
Fuck me, set it off
We done talked and we set it off
I'ma fuck, you just set it off
So fuck me and set it off

Better

[Verse]
I still wanna fuck you, you know what I do, shawty
I'm out with the crew, shawty, you know how I move, shawty
I've been with the thugs too, on that avenue, shawty
Sellin' on the avenue, you know what I had to do
I'm not 'bout to act with you, you know how I had to move
Grimey with the shooters, shawty, that's just how I had to move
Silence when you wait, girl, I'm up on the way, girl
Don't let me just wait, girl, don't let me mistake, girl
You know what I do, you know who I be with
I be on that G shit, fucked around three shit
All up on the couch, girl, we was on that freak shit
I be freakin' you, shawty, you ain't 'bout to move, shawty, no

[Hook]
And to think that thing that it don't make it better
Fuckin' you has seemed to make it better
Things I try to do to make it better
And to think that thing that it don't make it better
Don't make it better
And to think that thing that it don't make it better
Don't make it better
