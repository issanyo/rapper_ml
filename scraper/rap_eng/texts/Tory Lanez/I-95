[Chorus]
Uh, it's all good 'til that ride go low
And the hoes you was fuckin', they don't slide no more
That's why I'm on this I-95 alone
Ridin' with the windows down, tryna sip it down now, uh
I think about it when I'm high, oh no
Like I don't even expect you to ride no more
Guess I can't worry 'bout nothin' but mine no ,ore
That's why I'm on this I-95 like no no no no no
It's like nothin' all over now
West side girls, where the fuck you been?
If you really know a nigga, holla at me then

[Verse]
Am I still fuckin' with these bitches?
Told myself I wouldn't but she's here inside my livin' room
Same slick dress on, lipstick pressed on
Gave a couple reasons why she ain't for bein' slept on
Killer in the line of that outfit designer they just came out with
She got a problem maxin' out my card, I hardly doubt it
That's why I'm out in all these malls tryna call accountants
And any time she do me wrong, I start to fuck more 'bout it
Bitches that's down to stripin' down to they slickest outfits
And they just wanna fuck the kid with kicks that ain't come out yet
And I'm just livin' life, no chaser, lemon spice
Young entertainer, livin' life just like I'm Evan White
Pacin' all my blatant move
Like from the line and shootin' threes, you could be takin' twos
You know you greater so you just do what you made to do
Fuck what they say dog?
Just pray to God and make it through, now make your moves, nigga

[Chorus]
Uh, it's all good 'til that ride go low
And the hoes you was fuckin', they don't slide no more
That's why I'm on this I-95 alone
Ridin' with the windows down, tryna sip it down now, uh
I think about it when I'm high, oh no
Like I don't even expect you to ride no more
Guess I can't worry 'bout nothin' but mine no ,ore
That's why I'm on this I-95 like no no no no no
That's why I'm on this I-95 like no no no no no
West side girls, where the fuck you been?
If you really know a nigga, holla at me then
