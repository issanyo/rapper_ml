[Laughing]

[Intro]
Remember me for bein' laughed at
The kid with no cash when he asked where the cash at
People hustle all they life for diamonds and gold
And lose it all in one night by sellin' they soul
As the memories come and the memories go
People die every day but the memories don't
This my motherfuckin' album
