Do you know the dope man? I need some more

I’m in Givenchy baby, bussin' it down and I got it for bitches baby
Pull up and stunt we got the Givenchy baby
And all of my niggas is all in Givenchy baby
I'm in Givenchy baby, bustin' it down and I got it in four bitches baby
Pull up and stunt we got the Givenchy baby
And all of my niggas is all in Givenchy baby

[Verse 1]
Bought the Wraith, I said fuck a Ghost
Flew a brand new bitch across the coast
She from Mexico right off the gulf
She not just the bitch, that bitch the plug
Thirty and I'm servin' up the bando
I fuck all the bitches that my bitches can't know
.30 in my pants, I got a stand low
I just made enough to buy a Lambo
I'm in Givenchy baby, movin' the kitchen, baby
My bitches is cookin' and flippin', she doin' the dishes baby
Mac-11 like it's Michael Bivins, nigga new in edition baby
Two in extensions baby, we shootin extensions baby
Bustin' out the lows
I got all the bad bitches fuckin' wit my bros
I dropped outta school, couldn't pass the SATs
Now I got two bad bitches passin' me the weed
I done shot dice with Larry Bird in Barcelona
I done lost bets and told 'em niggas I ain't owe 'em
I'm the CEO and niggas drop off the program
Someone please find me the dope man

Dope man, dope man, dope
Dope man, dope man, go

[Verse 2]
She just wanna party with the dough
Double that Barcardi with the coke
She just wanna fuck and nothing more
I'm just making sure you up to go
Talking backwoods then I'm up again
She won't lemme fuck then I'ma fuck her friend
Scoreboard bitch I'm up 10
I'ma need some head to get me up again
Woah, I'm in Givenchy baby, movin' the kitchen baby
Doublin', adding up all of this money I'm doin' addition baby
Glock .40, like the top 40 when the shit get to mixing baby
And it get to mixin baby, and i get to fixin baby
Poppin' with the bands
I have no intention of splitting this shit with no one but my mans
Bitch I'm in the trenches with the poncho
Still got a nine like I'm Rondo
