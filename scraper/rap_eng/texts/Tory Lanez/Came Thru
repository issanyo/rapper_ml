[Verse 1]
I used to think 'bout how you came through
Did your thing, I did my thing too
You got some nerve to say I ain't true
I could do that but girl, I ain't you
For you girl, I'm so selfish
Wanted you for myself, it's selfless
And maybe it's time
That you remember how we (That you remember how we)
Look

[Chorus]
Girl, you remember how we came through
Back in the day we had the same crew
And lately, it feel like we ain't cool
Like you ain't sure, like you act like it ain't true
But girl, you used to call me baby
Girl, you used to call me baby
And me plus you used to be wavy
And now you don't even think about the times
When me and you would pull up, yeah
Shawty, we came through
Me and you would pull up, yeah
Shit ain't the same boo, even you changed too, yeah

[Verse 2]
Takin' love, yeah
Makin' love when I'm fuckin' on you, shawty
All I want to do to you is
Just remind you that we came through
Just remind you that them other bitches ain't you
Just remind you of the shit I could have gave you
Should have saved you
Should have made you mine
Just give me next time

[Bridge]
Used to call me baby
You'd appreciate me
Where did we go wrong?
Still tryna hold on
You were my baby
And I don't know about lately
But I'm on this road, oh no
I'm for real this time, shawty, look

[Chorus]
Girl, you remember how we came through
Back in the day we had the same crew
And lately, it feel like we ain't cool
Like you ain't sure, like you act like it ain't true
But girl, you used to call me baby
Girl, you used to call me baby
And me plus you used to be wavy
And now you don't even think about the times
When me and you would pull up, yeah
Shawty, we came through
Me and you would pull up, yeah
Shit ain't the same boo, even you changed too, yeah yeah
