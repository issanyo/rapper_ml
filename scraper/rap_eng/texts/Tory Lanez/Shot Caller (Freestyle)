As the lies fall, Canada

[Verse]
Shorty residential, I can be your sponsor
I don't want your love baby, just give me them tonsils
Honey know I'm fly like a fuckin' air marshall
Dot niggas ball, it don't matter what it cost you
My niggas on they chains like a motherfuckin' fence
Someone tell them lames hit the motherfuckin' bench
80 for the frames on the eyes of a king
Eyes out for the shirt, iPod for the ring, that's the iPhone
Bad bitches wanna bite me like a python
I'm in your skin like hair with the lice on
It like shit, you can get your face split
Like a zit that you pop when you think it's hot shit
I don't know how I did it, I don't know how I did it
I get so much pussy man, that I don't know how I get it
I be on that I hit it, you be on that I get it
You be on that grown shit, I be on that I live it
Ridin', I'm dippin' dirty, them bitches, they gettin' flirty
I'm high and I'm sippin' purple, I lie no, I'm in the dirty
Them bitches they wanna fuck, I pass to my nigga Kirky
We fuck then we get up early, you want it then get it early
The haters they black ball, paper the back ball
I hit em in the front and leave they brain in the back yard
It's paper to stack dawg, so why you niggas stallin'?
If you ain't stackin;, don't be actin like you ballin'
Actin like Spalding, all up on the court side
Ridin' for the north side, nigga come through
I'm lookin' smoother than a door slide
Move a couple units in, we can get the Porsche ride, livin' by the shore side
When I was just a youngin', imagine little 5-10
Nigga with a onion with some wishes for the bunion
Money ain't a power, ain't a fuckin' nigga stuntin'
I keep it too real that's why these fuckin' niggas frontin'
I put it on his head and let another nigga done him
Never touch the work, I let another nigga run 'em
Pack the Louis luggage, got the one way out to London
We just passed through customs, me and Jae be out the country
And I'm somethin' like a teepee, niggas can't see me
If you pullin' hoes, you gotta rope one for Stevie
Bitches couldn't play me if they burnt me on a CD
Model after model, shit is lookin' like a repeat
I fuck a bitch and pull the swave out of her
Shout my nigga Honey, it's gon' be a loud summer
That's my little sister and I'm very proud of her
Now back to the business, 'bout to blow this cloud bubble
And I, I do this shit, I'm too legit
Refuse your bitch, like a Skype call
I'm killin' germ ass niggas like some lysol
I'm eatin' through the game, it's like a rice wall
But yeah, can I say it any clearer?
That a nigga got your boo but ain't tryna get your scare, get it?
I slide through a chick like debit
Then she eat the dick like credit
Got a new trend and I just might set it
Should of let your mom know, I can get your mind blown
I can kill that bird on your shirt, you can die slow
This that SLS now get the fuck up outta my throne, motherfucker, oh yeah
