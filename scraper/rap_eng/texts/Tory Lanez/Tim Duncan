[Chorus]
I'm legendary with this ballin' like I'm Tim Duncan
Couple shooters in the cut and yeah I'm Tim Duncan
We just tryna go to legit, my niggas still thuggin'
I got shooters right beside like I'm Tim Duncan

[Verse 1]
I got shooters in the cut like I'm Tim Duncan
We just tryna go legit but niggas still thuggin'
I left the trap and I came back and it was still jumpin'
Bitch, I deserve a check for ballin' like I'm Tim Duncan
I went out with all them shooters and I'm still jumpin'
Grandma kicked me out the crib and I was still hustlin'
I went out to all them corners tryna deal somethin'
If the feds pull me over, I'm gon' peel on 'em, yeah
Dun know bitch, ya dun know, bitch, ya dun know
I just pulled the i8 out the 1-0
Bag man got that money, then you don't know
If bag man got that money, then you don't know
Shooters in the cut like I'm Tim Duncan
Send my ass to school and I was still flunkin'
I walk in the trap and I see real niggas
I walk in the trap and I see real niggas
I see real niggas
I walk in the trap and I see real niggas
Tim Duncan
Now I got fish scales all up in the trap house
I got big scales all up in the trap house
A bitch from Rexdale trappin' out my dime house
I got a Nextel trappin' out my dime house
Yeah, whip a hundred bricks just like a hundred load
I got two hundred bitches fuckin' in a bungalow
I got two sisters doin' shit that they ain't done before
I ain't no fool, I put that icin' on that Dunkin' Donut, yeah I do it
I, okay, I'm okay
But I'm high with some Rosé, you know it
I don't fly with that foreplay, all them eyes
Lil mama don't forget, I'm Mr. Ring around the Rosé
Nigga fuck with me I bring your ting around the Rosé
.40 on my side, don't let me ring it around your forehead
We gon' make a movie with you nigga like we Scorsese

[Chorus]
I'm legendary with this ballin' like I'm Tim Duncan
Couple shooters in the cut and ya I'm Tim Duncan
We just tryna go legit, my niggas still thuggin'
I got shooters right beside me like I'm Tim Duncan

[Verse 2]
Pull up, yeah you know I'm with them shooters
All we do is exhale with that Uber
Love me baby, love me like Katrina
Smokin' dope, I know I'm off it
Goin' Tim Duncan with all of the shooters, with all of the shooters
'Cause they call it murder but we who they callin' to do it, we who they callin' to do it
Love me baby, love a nigga
Pullin' out the lot, stuntin' on a couple niggas
Only with a couple hittas
Only let a couple bitches cook up in this kitchen, nigga
Hit a lick with all my young niggas, now my whip is Kristi Yamaguchi
My wrist and my neck is on Burberry and now them niggas thinkin' that it's Gucci
Niggas talkin' at you loosely
Dawg I give a fuck about your so called shooters that'll come and shoot me
It's not what we used to
Dawg, I be used to these bitches
Fuck up a ride, ain't got room for them bitches
Fuck the roommate, ain't got no rules for them bitches
Fuck the room, I got the roof for them bitches
Pop the stowaway, ain't no room for them bitches
In the bathroom, Fruit of Loom on them bitches
When they lie, I got the proof for them bitches
If she dry I got some lube for them bitches
Fuckin' on lil mama good
I can tell she from the hood
All I got is Hennessy for her
And some weed for her, couple nugs
Poppin' off a couple juggs
Shottas in a couple hoods
Niggas that'll come and wash that
Cookin' niggas, come and sauce that
Money on a couple tables
It's not that she love me, she want to fuck with a young nigga that's gettin' money
Motherfucker understand the way I get paper, my nigga, I'm good
I put that everythin' like it's sauce nigga
I be on everythin' like a boss nigga
Handlin' plays just like lacrosse nigga, yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, you know I'm done talkin' nigga
Fuck around and try niggas
You make the man dem pull up on this
Let the dawgs they'll just bite that
Know what I'm sayin'
You let the dawgs dem just bite that you feel me, ahaa
Tim Duncan, Tim Duncan
Tim Duncan, Tim Duncan
Tim, Tim Duncan, bite that
Tim Duncan, Tim Duncan
