[Intro: Ric Flair]
Woo, that's who's standing here today
The World's Heavyweight Champion
Only one, and you're looking
Oh knows I can't stand it
Now I gotta talk, we all gotta be quiet
Nikita Koloff, we've only just begun

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Boy floatin' down shit's creek
Who gon' need the paddle when the shit's deep?
We ain't Bobby Shmurda but the clique deep
Caught a body a week ago, we were this weak, don't fuck with me
Boy floatin' down shit's creek
Who gon' need the paddle when the shit's deep?
We ain't Bobby Shmurda but the clique deep
Caught a body a week ago, we were this weak
I just want it all, I just want it all
Even when I'm knowin' that ain't shit to you
I just pray to God, I just pray to God
Oh Lord, you done made my wrist weak
Jumpman, you could call me Air Jordan
Pullin' out the lot like Iâ€™m Jeff Gordon
We fuckin' Ric Flair on 'em
Pullin' out the chamber like a shareholder
I just got some mutherfuckin'
Puttin' bitches all up in a landcaster
Took a bitch and flew her out to South Beach
This is how you put a doll in a sand castle
Done know, we dumb blowed
I could live without a magazine cover
But shout out to my niggas from the XXL
All I need is, Magnum rubbers
But fuck the competition, let the sex sale

[Bridge]
Side diss, dog
You talkin' 'bout you fuckin my bitch, aw
Let's keep it real, I never eat your baby, mom
But boy I treat her like a side dish, dawg, don't get it fucked up

[Verse 2]
Last time, I ain't had time for it
But today I got time for it
Nigga dressin' up in Tom Ford
Just to get that (clap, clap) like my dogs tryna encore
Oh my God, you a hater, nigga, on my mom
And no lie, I be on my job
A lot of niggas be jammed
When they talkin' but they don't want drama
We a different kinda sinister
Rollie presidential but the prime minister
Niggas got a chopper and a nine milliter
Liu Kang niggas acting fly finish' 'em, woo

[Chorus]
Ric Flair, the bitches love me on my Ric Flair
Ric Flair, the bitches love me on my Ric Flair
Ric Flair, the bitches love me on my Ric Flair
Nigga, Ric Flair, yeah, the money long like my bitch hair

[Interlude: Rory Trustory]
All these bitches should know
All these niggas should know
All these bitches should know
All these niggas shit, done known, done known
All these bitches should know
All these niggas should know
All these bitches should know
All these niggas shit, done known, done known

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I'm sorry nigga, you forced it
Fuck it, just say you love it and forfeit
All my brothers goin' corporate
I see us #1 on this Forbes' list
My closet still covered in Jordan's
Still thuggin', still ruggin', niggas still can't fuckin' afford this
'Bout to pay the lawyers off for my nigga Kellz
We still talkin' like they're cell phones in his cell
I touchdown just like its NFL, then I'm in a SSL
Then I'm in a shawty named Vanessa cell
I'm pullin' off the SLS, sippin' VSOP
It got me stressin' and yes I'm callin' up the SOD's
Abbreviation talk, bang bang hate to talk
We pull up in matchin' cars 'cause we hate to walk
With more problems always comin' from this dope shit
Hoe shit, want to stop your whole cash flow shit
Put your feelings in the air, niggas wanna hold shit
Oh shit, hate the man the "open the door" shit
I'm only fuckin' with my nigga Sasha
A lot of niggas is some rich impostors
Thick woman whippin' pasta, plus sippin' vodka
Never fuck the money up, don't think this shit was flocka
Back when play was playback, you knew the kid from way back
We Maybach major, I got aggressive and lay back haters
But niggas ain't really ain't got nothing'against me
They just hate that paper, well, grat grat, take that hater
I think it's clear I hate the plateaus, and the platform
I bring it back like the Afros, ain't no platforms
And plus the plaque here, that's the young here
I'm ballin' like AND1 here
I'm offstage a bunch of white bitches yellin' fuck yeah
This for the niggas with no ambitions
This for the bitches with heart intentions and your commitments
You know we old school, since '02 with the pro-tools
We would scroll through, fresh niggas bustin' dope moves
Look, I heard you tellin' lies, shit was funny
These niggas disrespect the kid, I get they bitch to fuck me
If she miss out on fuckin' me, that bitch gon' miss the money just to love me
I treat you niggas like some distant cousins
Don't give a fuck who make the XXL cover
Fuck the competition with some XXL rubbers
Heard them birds chirpin', they some next Nextel brothers
Niggas try to hate, I had to check check tail brothers
Y'all know, I'm so original like old school and Nike checks
I fuck the game up then I fuck your wifey next
I'm so serial, I eat these niggas up for cereal
I'm talkin' life, checks
Nigga, you don't understand, boy
We can go O for O, hoe for hoe, check for check
Dawg, we can go bad bitch, slut, head, neck for neck
Nigga, we ain't never gon' be neck to neck, dawg
