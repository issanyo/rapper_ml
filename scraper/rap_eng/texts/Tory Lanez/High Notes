[Verse 1]
Take my love aside
Talking of my appreciation, babe
Touch me, feel me on you
Half of me, know we can't play no games

[Pre-Chorus]
Love in the bedroom
Feeling I'm addicted to it
Knocking the headboard
Baby, I'm addicted to it

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to you daily
We can do our thing 'til the sun comes up
Baby, if this love was a symphony
If love was a symphony
Then we'd be the high notes
Yeah, raising the high notes
Raising the high notes

[Verse 2]
Take my confidence in
Make it bigger 'cause girl, I need you
Give me necessary
All the things to, all this love, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Love in the bedroom
Feeling I'm addicted to it
Knocking the headboard
Your my gun and I'ma pull the trigger just to show it

[Chorus]
I wanna make love to you daily
We can do our thing 'til the sun comes up
Baby, if this love was a symphony
If love was a symphony
Then we'd be the high notes
Yeah, raising the high notes
Raising the high notes

[Outro]
Take me away from it
Pretty little symphony
Pretty little symphony
