Hook (Tory Lanez):
Is we gon' fuck in the morning?
You fuck me so good when you want it
So is we gon' fuck in the morning
So is we gon, is we gon, is we gon, baby is we
Is we gon fuck in morning? (Fuck me like you want it too)
You fuck me so good when you want it (I know what  you wanna do)
Is we gon fuck in morning? (Fuck me like you want it too)
Baby is we, baby is we, baby is we? (Is we?)

Verse 1 (Tracy T):
In the club contemplating on comin' home with me, woah
Goin, goin, goin, goin til' i'm done with it
You can leave me alone with it, ain't no snoozing
See the sun with me. Baby you can see the sun with me
Then its back to the money, my palms itchy
Make your toes curl, call me Zaddy, in da morning have you comin' out your panties
Leave the club i'm on that alcohol, you know that good pussy gotta have it
Beat it up, turn around and then I slap it
Give me up, its going down automatic
Ride me like a roller coaster... if you comin' over...

Hook (Tory Lanez):
Is we gon' fuck in the morning?
You fuck me so good when you want it
So is we gon' fuck in the morning
So is we gon', is we gon, is we gon', baby is we
Is we gon fuck in morning? (Fuck me like you want it too)
You fuck me so good when you want it (I know what  you wanna do)
Is we gon' fuck in morning? (Fuck me like you want it too)
Baby is we, baby is we, baby is we? (Is we?)

Verse 2 (Tracy T):
Know I been waiting for the moment
For you to turn around and jump up on it
Playing with it til i get it drippin'
Do it from the back like a dog
Breakfast in bed baby, right between your legs baby
And you know imma eat what i ordered, finish what I started, we fuck in the morning
And you wet like you fresh out the water, and imma go deep when I swim in her ocean
(Shout out to x5) the drink got you open
You can't front girl you know that you want it
From the back girl I go in it and own it
Know you leavin' with me, but I got a question before you come over:

You fuck me so good when you want it
So is we gon' fuck in the morning
So is we gon', is we gon, is we gon', baby is we
Is we gon fuck in morning? (Fuck me like you want it too)
You fuck me so good when you want it (I know what  you wanna do)
Is we gon' fuck in morning? (Fuck me like you want it too)
Baby is we, baby is we, baby is we? (Is we?)
