Jalissa: Hello?
Jalissa's Friend: So, Jalissa
Jalissa: What?
Jalissa's Friend: I heard, you did it with Tory
Jalissa: Who you heard I did Tory from now?
Jalissa's Friend: The block bitch and you not low
Jalissa: The block? If it was up to the block, I would have fucked the whole block. Please, nobody checkin' for that
Jalissa's Friend: Yeah yeah yeah, whatever, so how was it?
Jalissa: It was nothin', this is the same Tory I used to play back in the day
Jalissa's Friend: Obviously it wasn't the same Tory, you was all up in this nigga's car
Jalissa: Okay, I might have sat in his car, I might have went home with him and let him smash. So what? If I could go back to that day right now, I would have never let that nigga fuck
Jalissa's Friend: Yeah, yeah
Jalissa: I'm about to go to his house right now and smash every window out his motherfuckin' car. Because that nigga is nothin' but a dirtbag. He is a lowdown, dirty, piece of shit. He is nothin' but a motherfuckin' scrub.
