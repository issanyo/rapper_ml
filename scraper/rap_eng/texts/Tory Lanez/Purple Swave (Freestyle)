[Intro]
Ay nigga, 16 bars long. Don't matter how deep my knapsack is and your bitch is in it, my G

[Verse 1]
Maserati door tint
Little niggas gettin' change like Clark Kent's
Little niggas on they Jane like Tarazan
Pop up like what's up like Martin
I've been bein' the boss
So please can you excuse the cigars and
We are not the same but I'm not a Martian
I'm just richer and livin' my life bigger
I pick up with my niggas
Sip liquor with fine bitches
I enjoy livin', self employed livin'
Deploy women, let a d-boy hit it
No when a t boy get you
Can be the decoy like Leroy did it

[Interlude]
Everythin' is swavey, everythin' is swavey
Fuck around
I'm gon' take your lady, we gon' make a baby
I'm just jokin'

[Verse 2]
I'm just strokin' her back like lotion
I just opened the pack like Motrin
I dip slow in the back like Oakland
And tell a hoe, "Give me room" like Roslin
No excuse for the use of the potion
Nigga, we just out here tryna function
Gold grill, give a lil bitch cold chills
I don't really give a shit about a hoe still
But I will let her ride like a four wheel
'Cause she do eat a dick like oatmeal
Nigga got 2 L's like roshell
Told me make it wet and I lake her, O'Neal
And I'm so trill and your hoe feel
That I'm so real and she know well
No better, no cheddar mean no retta ski mask
And a gpad, said she got tryna hoe
Yo end up niggas hatin' on the way dope get up
'Til I get off beat, it's a ten on street
And I'm back on beat, yes I'm back on track
Yes, I'm back on feet on the one two like everybody on three
Payed ass nigga, the money elevatin'
That's hella swave ass, nigga
Make these jealous hatin' niggas want to way that trigga
What's funny is I know these niggas from way back, nigga
Like damn, niggas like wam
In a yellow Lam', shit look like scrambled eggs
Money as long as a tall bitch legs
Y'all niggas small as a small kids head b
Boss is a pussy and you all dickheads
She don't give a fuck 'bout a small dick head
She just want to fuck, make a quick bread
Better follow me, don't be mislead
And I'm hated on like I'm tryna get head
Eat a nigga dick like you tryna get fed
Your old favorite rapper just went dead
Okay, my guys to get you here
I can pray to God, forgive your sins
Ain't no wastin' time, I'm gettin' those inns
Like a hotel, hoes know well that I'm so well
Like 4's on the coat tail, white hoes in the motel
Roll well with the cigar
Fuck around right now motherfucker, I will make you see God

[Outro]
That's enough free shit for y'all niggas, man
By the way, my nigga Jae say fuck y'all niggas
Yeah, Canada, nigga
I got your bitches in my knapsack
I got your bitches in my knapsack
I said I got your bitches in my knapsack
Got your bitches in my knapsack
Sincerely Tory, March 26, nigga
Get a motherfuckin' hard copy
Buy my shit on iTunes, nigga
