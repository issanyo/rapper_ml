[Verse 1]
Is it just me or what I got in my cup?
Reminding me of you, baby
That time we got drunk and we made love
Then we did it again
Thought I was over love
But I'm here again
Never thought I'd be in this position
Now you got me on a mission
That's to give all this attention to you, baby
I'm falling for you, that's the truth, baby
Can't lie, I got nothing to lose, baby
Every kiss got me so faded
Let me see that ass again
Back it up for me, baby
That's a pretty picture, put it in a frame, ay
Do I look like I give a fuck about your man, ay?
Let's get out of here and we can do the damn thang
I got love for you so whatcha say, babe?

[Chorus]
Everyone falls in love sometimes
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
If you let me love you, if let me touch you
Love you long time, baby
If you let me love you, if you let me touch you
Love you long time, babe

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, aah, ooh, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, ooh, aah, ooh, woah, if you let me love you like...
Ooh, aah, ooh, aah, ooh, if you let me touch you like...
Ooh, aah, ooh, aah, ooh, ay

[Verse 2]
Booty out of this world
Call that ass-tronomical
You got just what I like
And I ain't tryna be comical
Phenomenal: baby, that's what you are
Don't have to look up in the sky 'cause baby, you're my shining star
Ain't nobody touch me like you do, love me like you do, suck it like you do
They can't fuck me like you do
They can try, they can try but they can't compare to you
Porque ello simplemente no son usted
Basically you the truth, baby
You the only one know what to do, baby
You the only one who love me good, baby
Got me 'bout to put a ring on you, baby
'Cause I like it
Just do it like Nike
I know what you want, call me psychic
Done with that shy shit
I know what you want
But, but...

[Chorus] [x2]
Everyone falls in love sometimes
I don't know 'bout you but it ain't a crime
If you let me love you, if let me touch you
Love you long time, baby
If you let me love you, if you let me touch you
Love you long time, babe


[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, aah, ooh, aah, ooh
Ooh, aah, ooh, aah, ooh
