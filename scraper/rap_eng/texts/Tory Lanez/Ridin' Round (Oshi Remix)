[Chorus]
I'm ridin' 'round and my car's low
(What you waitin' for?)
I feel like I hit the lotto
(What you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my girl's high
(What you waitin' for?)
We're ridin' 'round just to get by
(What the fuck you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my car's low
(What you waitin' for?)
I feel like I hit the lotto
(What you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my girl's high
(What you waitin' for?)
We're ridin' 'round just to get by
(What the fuck you waitin' for?)

[Verse 1: Kali Uchis]
I don't gotta hide, no, I don't got reason to lie
I don't need your drama, I don't need you to survive
You don't gotta say it cause I know that you don't like me
You and all your friends can open wide, go on and bite me
I know I'm some shit and I'm cool with it
You can't tell me shit, don't come and share your dialect
Ridin' 'round your city like the cops now
Cause there's no way that we're gonna stop now

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
I'm ridin' 'round and my car's low
(What you waitin' for?)
I feel like I hit the lotto
(What you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my girl's high
(What you waitin' for?)
We're ridin' 'round just to get by
(What the fuck you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my car's low
(What you waitin' for?)
I feel like I hit the lotto
(What you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my girl's high
(What you waitin' for?)
We're ridin' 'round just to get by
(What the fuck you waitin' for?)

[Verse 2: Kali Uchis]
I know it sounds strange, but I used to count change
On the counter at the grocery store, the bags I would arrange
Now his face is looking kinda flustered
He didn't know that I was my own hustler
Baby, understand, I don't need a man
Fuck me over, I'll fuck you worse then take off to Japan
Think that I couldn't cross the street without holdin' his hand
And if he did his dirt then he'd get off with a reprimand

[Verse 3: Kali Uchis]
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Now we're ridin' 'round your city with the top down
Ridin' 'round your city like the cops now
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Ridin' 'round your city with the top down
Cause my passenger is pretty, we won't stop now

[Verse 4: Tory Lanez]
I used to ride around the city with my top down
I was lookin' for the heart that I don't got now
Said she came to me in question
She said hi my name is Kali
She had California sunshine
But ain't come from Napa Valley
(I should've known)
Shawty got me fooled on the low
(How could I know?)
She played it cool like a pro
Now I ride around the city and my passenger is empty
She don't call to say she love me
She just flex and start to text me that...

[Chorus: Kali Uchis]
I'm ridin' 'round and my car's low
(What you waitin' for?)
I feel like I hit the lotto
(What you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my girl's high
(What you waitin' for?)
We're ridin' 'round just to get by
(What the fuck you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my car's low
(What you waitin' for?)
I feel like I hit the lotto
(What you waitin' for?)
I'm ridin' 'round and my girl's high
(What you waitin' for?)
We're ridin' 'round just to get by
(What the fuck you waitin' for?)
