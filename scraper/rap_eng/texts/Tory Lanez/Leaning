[Intro: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Na, na, na, oh yeah
Fiesta
PARTY

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Oh I'm leaning, 420 leaning
You know I don't know steamin'
Secrets you keepin', I never keep 'em
I know you seen 'em
See 'em in a Roll-Royce leanin'
Chick name Janina, slim like my nina
Out in Miami, Dolphin Marina
Let me fly you out where it's sandy
Taste like candy, face on yandy
No V-Day, 28, just grindin'
Pink brown eyes, all Asian and slanted
Niggas all on you, I can't stand it
I booked the flight baby, I just landed
I just rented, two of you at Camden
You still got it, Yorkdale shoppin'
You’re still poppin', you’re still top of my
Top of my list...

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Girl, I be in it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Side ting mad, when she not who I pree
This is for the girls born in the 90's
I'ma let you finish, let me get to my
Girl, I be in it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Side ting mad when she not who I pree
This is for the girls born in the 90's
I'ma let you finish, let me get to my

[Verse 2: PARTYNEXTDOOR]
Money
I hear the racks talkin', gotta relax on ya'
Girls gettin' me in trouble all the time (Oh yeah)
Out here lookin' for a diamond in the rough (You dig, you dig, yeah)
And this goes to the ones that I thought were the ones
That never turn to thots when summertime come
Ain't no suckin' (Ain't no suckin')
That's when I need some (Some)
Baby girl, that's why I need ya (Need ya)
You nuh make it no easier
And that's why I'm leaning

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & PARTYNEXTDOOR]
I be in it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Side ting mad, when she not who I pree
This is for the girls born in the 90's
I'ma let you finish, let me get to my
Girl, I be in it so deep, I ain't slept in five weeks
Sad ting mad when she not I pree
This is for the girls born in the 90's (This one, this one for)
I'ma let you finish, let me get to my
This one, this one for
