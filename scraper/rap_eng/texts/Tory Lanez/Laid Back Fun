Swavey
Ayo swavey, we did it to them

[Verse 1]
Every day stuntin', lil' buddy, gettin' money, you ain't never seen another one
Every girl love me, but there's only one me, there will never be another one
Oh my, so fly that I'm feelin' like flack yo feelings
Got stacks, stacks, stacks of that money at the top of the ceilin'
And a nigga do swerve, in the places of the world you ain't never been thought of
And a kid do ball like my nigga name Jordan and I'm Vince Carter
I could holla when you with her, she say don't like niggas, well I told her me either
And I like it like 12, I get all the white girls call me Justin Bieber

[Chorus]
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back fun
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back
You ain't never done it in a Maybach

[Verse 2]
Why you doin' that there? Why you wearin' that dress? Did you do that for me?
And if I look sexy, then nigga, my car is a flackin' Porsche
Break it down, say it loud, let me lay ya down, we can do it all out
Let me get into position, then maybe you can switch it and try to show me what you all 'bout
Got girls, got niggas, got hoes, got purp, got bitches on deck, boy
But a nigga gettin' at it, when ya love a nigga tatted from my wrist to my neck boy
Yeah I'm tryna get studded but a kid that stay stuntin' ain't nothin' on a lay back
Told her put a her tongue here and done it in a Maybach

[Hook]
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back fun
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach

[Bridge]
Baby, with me, you can ride with the stars
Whatever you need, I got it in my car
Baby, with me, you can ride with the stars
Whatever you need, I got it in my car, got it in my car

[Chorus]
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back fun
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Girl, pull back the curtains, let's have laid back
You ain't never done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach
Done it in a Maybach
