[Intro]
Canada
You know the wooden beads
Uh, Swavey, baby

[Verse 1]
Hola how you do me, this that Polo with that Louis
I'm Pacino in this bitch and you Manolo in that movie
This that Uzi, I'm no thug, no bitch can't use me, I'm no drug
But I put that toolie to your mug, hot as a two-piece to your tongue
Canada conglomerate, blammers I've got on my back
You ain't gotta go to the zoo to see where them llamas at
Put them 24s on my coupe, it look like I'm tryna stack
Higher than a pile at the laundromat, Swavey
I be stackin' books, so I'm a time-is-money author
Please don't hit my phone, unless that thing a money offer
I be ballin' so hard that my name fill the whole roster
I can never go to jail 'cause boy I own a law firm
Bitch, I got that twista in my swisha
This the shit to hit ya frame until you niggas get the picture
I just hit 180 on my jigsaw, that's your lady? She my bitch
Look I'm so mixed up, where my fix-up?
Hola, cómo está? Spanish women on my jock
Spend so much guap at the club that they had to ban me from the spot
I live in Miami where it's hot and I get in them panties, where your spot?
I be sippin' that liquor that put me inside the position to get me to gettin' that guap, boy
Hop in my delorous-lorious, y'all niggas should forfeit, forfeit
My new chick is so bad, so bad, she used to be your bitch, your bitch
Hear you haters talkin', but I just ignore it
My money, my lady, she overweight, I feel like I'm Norbit

[Hook]
Don't take a picture, take a look at me
Boy, I goes hard, this my wooden beads
Hatin' on money, you couldn't be
Oh and I'm so sick, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Boy, I goes hard, this my wooden beads

[Verse 2]
Back in this bitch and I'm packin' a fifth
And I'm ready for action, you actin' the ish
And you talkin' that trash, it's a smack to your lips
I don't give a fuck 'bout it, I'm packin' a clip
That'll give you that static with that automatic
I let niggas have it who's back in that ratchet
Despite all the havoc, I have what you lackin'
You assholes, fastfo'd
Rewind, now we are on me time
Niggas got them pies and I ain't talkin' 'bout them Key Limes
Ooh, I'm sayin' this more than two times
Sayin' this more than two times
Thousand-thousand-thousand dollar necklace out of Dubai
Look up in the sky and you would see me if I flew by
Put that .22 right to the middle of your two eyes
If you in the building, bitch, meet the new guy
If you in the building, bitch, meet the new guy
Oh you love me? Me too, I'm ridin' with no G2
I just call her up before I beat it, get her pre-juiced
Tryna get this cash but if I smash, she can be loose
I'm too busy bein' me, so fuck tryna be you, Swavey

[Hook]
Don't take a picture, take a look at me
Boy, I goes hard, this my wooden beads
Hatin' on money, you couldn't be
Oh and I'm so sick, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Aww, Swavey, these niggas sick of me
Boy, I goes hard, this my wooden beads

[Outro]
Ay, ay Jae Fresco, ay, ay, ay Jae Fresco. Give these niggas a fuckin' year supply of thermometers, some Tylenol, and some robitussin. These niggas sick of us nigga. Yeah, Swavey, Canada. And I say that to the death, nigga, uh. Yo Cirraco take my beat out man, I don't want these niggas loopin' it
