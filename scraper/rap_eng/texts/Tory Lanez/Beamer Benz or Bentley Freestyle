[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]



Bout to murder this shit nigga look
Beamer benz or bentley, my jeans ain't ever empty
And nigga I ain't gucci but no skier ever get me
The 7 series Beamer ain't the reason they respect me
I ain't never been a pussy cause my team will never let me
The modern day hanibal, flock fresh animal I'm sick I'm sick and I ain't got a antidote
Skeetin in yo gurls mouth and her throat, I'll grill ya'll peel like cantilope
Oh and it's so sinsurr, two european broads and they both in hurr
Me and ryhmes took turns we was both in thurr and my girl is like a fox but she don't wear fur
Ho's used to say no now they like oh yeah sure, they don't even call me Lanez they like oh yes sir
I'm a go getter, never go get her, from her crib what I look like dat ho chaffuer. gettin hella dome
Put lady gaga on my telephone, hella gone ay yo girl beat no metronome
My new bitch she a yellow bone, I buy her yellow stones cause I like it when she got that yellow on
Now tell me where the flag beat at
If I had one wish I'd bring mack's beat back
Bought to buy a lamb tell me where da back seat at
Please free gucci, boozy and weezy we black
So you could say that Tory Lanez is a porn star but you couldn't find my roof with an on-star
Never slip nigga I be on guard
Sicker than a swine no time for your corn bars
Eight long bags, stay calm fag, I'm a more beast then the J arms tag, colder than another shuttle tell me where the quilt at
Tory is a motherfucker tell me where the milf at
I can get you killed back, like the way I kill tracks, we gon leave you with yo scout and it's all peeled back
Only nigga dat be hangin like a pendant, rip the beat so hard niggas had to mend it
Fuck it let's cement it, cause I killed it I'm feeling some resentment
Fuck I just killed that shit, so I'm a come back and avenge it
Reincarnation of the track on some revenge shit
Step inside da club all da guns and da frenzy
I be writin till my pen break cause I'm hungry
I'm to da point that my ribs ache
I just wanna see yo hips shake
My Latin shawty call me poppa while she fix me up a big steak
See I'm hungry for a big plate and I'm never full even though I just ate
Call me the four model fucka, get they twist on like a soda bottle cover
Tired of breaking it to niggas dat I got they lover, hold her and I fold her like some sort of origami sculpture
Read between the lines, see between her eyes
Killing dat pussy R.I.P between yo thighs
I seem to be despised by some very evil guys
Fake niggas do fake shit so don't believe the lies
