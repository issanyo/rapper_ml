[Pre-Hook: Tory Lanez]
All I can do is, keep this shit true and (yeah)
All I can do is keep this shit real, won't lie
I'm into you, and you know the deal, don't lie
Just be on the move, like be on the move, be on the move

[Hook 1: Tory Lanez]
She knows she bad and mine tonight
You know I need ass and them racks on ya
I throw a hundred bands on that ass on ya
I throw a hundred bands on that ass oh
She up for the night and I'm down for
But I'm up for ride if she down for
And I'm up for the night and I'm down for
And its all when its right

[Verse 2: Spenzo]
To be honest I'm that nigga, two bad bitches with me
One twerking like Miley, the other twerking like Nicki
Y'all gotta be fucking, talking bout' we not, Ion believe it
Michael Jackson trying to beat it, then tell y'all beat it
Got me switching lanes with bro, yeah you know that nigga Tory
Say he gon' take me to Toronto, I got him up in the [?], and it's gory
Put him on a bad bitch, told the nigga don't trip, don't worry
She gon' get the job done, she gonna handle that for me
To be honest with ya, to be honest with ya, man she already know
To be honest with ya, Englewood southside, I'm reppin' till I go
With same niggas that I started with, shit there ain't no need for more
With same niggas that I started with, when I was kickin' down the door
Real talk, with same niggas that I started with, when I was posted at the store
With the same bitches that I started with, when I was living on the floor
Still the same nigga, only thing change is the money and the dough
Girl you better tell you ain't my bitch, but it feel like it though

[Hook 2: Spenzo and Tory Lanez]
Girl I want you, you, you
You know I want you, you, you
You know I want you, you, you
You know I want you, I want you

[Hook 1: Tory Lanez]
She know she bad and mine tonight

I throw a hundred bands on her ass
She up for the night and I'm down for
But I'm up for ride if she down for
And I'm up for night and I'm down for
And it's all [?]

[Pre-Hook: Tory Lanez]
All I can do is keep this shit real, won't lie
I'm in the [?], and you know the deal, don't lie
Just be on the move, like be on the move, be on the move
You see her on the news, you see her on the news
