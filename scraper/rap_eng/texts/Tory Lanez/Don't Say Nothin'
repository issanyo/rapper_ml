[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Don't say nothin' to nobody else
‘Cause the mornin' they got sum' else thinkin'
And no more, not thinkin' ‘bout all bitches
Don't roll up, just wanna fuck with you
You got all yo mix, you got all yo mix
Just snort it all, I got all my bitches
I got all my bitches
Cuz I know that you got all yo mix, you got all yo mix
Just snort it all, I got all my bitches
So maybe me and you can do somethin' tonight

[Verse 1: Dr Maleek]
Post it for the deep with the homies
Girl, I wanna catch you while you're lonely
From the dance floor, to the VIP, no romance
Hardcore, 50 Shades of Maleek, ha
Don't behave, she a freak
I'm the doctor, but shawty got a PHD in the sheets, yeah
C'est la vie, pimpin' errday, playin' fo' keeps
Me and Game got 'em layin' the feats
Hit Russian vagin-aline, tote it for the migraine
Dipped it first medicine, take a sip and settle in
And I ain't Cosby, so best believe you gon' remember everythin'

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Don't say nothin' to nobody else
‘Cause the mornin' they got sum' else thinkin'
And no more, not thinkin' ‘bout all bitches
Don't roll up, just wanna fuck with you
You got all yo mix, you got all yo mix
Just snort it all, I got all my bitches
I got all my bitches
Cuz I know that you got all yo mix, you got all yo mix
Just snort it all, I got all my bitches
So maybe me and you can do somethin' tonight

[Verse 2: The Game]
Busy girl with the nips, I wanna see it all
See that top off through the Megans when I get it to the crib
This stuff'll lead tho
Keep it on the DL, leave it in the DM's
Don't be screen shotin' and sendin' it to my BM
I laid in it from the AM to the PM
I stayed in it all night, stressed in that Benzo
Fogged up the window, she blew me like endo
Dick so good, I could never be in the friend zone
I ate the pussy out for six songs
R. Kelly, RiRi, Beyonce
Ay, it's Fine Nigga Friday

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Don't say nothin', don't say nothin', don't say nothin'
Don't say nothin' to nobody else
‘Cause the mornin' they got sum' else thinkin'
And no more, not thinkin' ‘bout all bitches
Don't roll up, just wanna fuck with you
You got all yo mix, you got all yo mix
Just snort it all, I got all my bitches
I got all my bitches
Cuz I know that you got all yo mix, you got all yo mix
Just snort it all, I got all my bitches
So maybe me and you can do somethin' tonight

[Verse 3: Dr Maleek]
Life lavish, pipe passive
See you're likin' on my pick, spend that ass backwards
Less talkin', more action, less attractive
Take you hotel fo' a lil sex practice
Kick back and zip that black hair and thick ass
I'm with that, I swing fast
Cuz I'm a baller, shot caller
Straight money Malia
Money way taller, death no dishonor
Fuck haters, count commas
All mommas know drama
All about us, peace sign cuz we did ballin'
It's the DR Mobb shit out of California

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Don't say nothin' to nobody else
‘Cause the mornin' they got sum' else thinkin'
And no more, not thinkin' ‘bout all bitches
Don't roll up, just wanna fuck with you
You got all yo mix, you got all yo mix
Just snort it all, I got all my bitches
I got all my bitches
Cuz I know that you got all yo mix, you got all yo mix
Just snort it all, I got all my bitches
So maybe me and you can do somethin' tonight

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
And it goes up fo'
And it goes up fo'
All of my down ass bitches
Keep lock down, stay around as me
And it goes up fo'
And it goes up fo'
All of my real ass niggas
You should chill out with me, around
