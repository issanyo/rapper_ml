It's too easy
Know what she gon' do, she gon' pop it open for me, nigga
I know she know a real nigga when she see one

(Verse 1 - Khalil)
She's been waitin' all night (all night)
There's no complainin', cause she know I'mma do it right
I know she's hidin', I see it all on yo face
Said girl stop lyin', cause you know a young nigga like a chase

(Pre-Hook)
I go either way
Baby girl, once I get you home
Baby, tell me what you want
Girl, ain't no time to waste
I swear you got me goin' now cuz

(Hook)
You know you got it baby
Man just look at how she pop it
Got me throwin' all my paper
I'm a real nigga, baby, if yo man got a problem
Tell him we can solve 'em, baby

(Verse 2: Blake Kelly)
Fresh out the jello, model bail car finally scoop me
He be dippin' in the vet and I was in the uber
'Fore I got locked had these strippers, gettin' money to it
Fuckin, for some money had them bitches bumpin' to it
Lay in the kitchen, gettin' loose, we just playin' music
My nigga had the bong, I'm smokin' while you chill out loose it
You get upstairs, me? I get the bottom floor
Where the condoms, I told them in the top drawer
Why wait for tomorrow while it could be today?
She twerk for money, but for us it's free
That bitch from Houston, said she fuck with G's
Clearly, that's why I see you fuck with me
Two scooters, ask Boosie, ka-boosie, goose it then loose it
Get my niggas outta Miami because the beaches are cooler
Six change on a nigga but my big one Medusa
And they sayin I'm a king, but I just feel like a ruler
Ha!

(Pre-Hook)
I go either way
Baby girl, once I get you home
Baby, tell me what you want
Girl, ain't no time to waste
I swear you got me goin' now cuz

(Hook)
You know you got a baby
I just look at how she pop it
Got me throwin' all my paper
I'm a real nigga, baby, if yo man got a problem
Tell him we can solve them, baby
