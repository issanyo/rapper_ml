Lyrics from snippet


[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I don't feel too well
Rolex on me sick, it don't feel too well
The gang throwin' up we don't feel too well
Said my neck is freezin' cold, I don't feel too well
Momma hit my phone, say she worried 'bout my health, yeah
I don't feel too well
I don't feel too well
I don't feel too well, yeah
I don't feel too well
I don't feel too well

[Verse 1: Trippie Redd]
Uh, molly in my nails
I'm drippin' Chanel
I'm the dog, gon' give 'em hell
Beat the pussy 'til it's pale
Fuck her make her yell
Countin' all this green like kale
[?]
How you ridin' and you tell
Everyone for themselves
Man, this world so cold
And my wrist so cold
Man I'm sick, I got a cold
Need a fuckin' mink coat, Yeah
[?] Like I got a strep throat

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
I don't feel too well
Rolex on me sick, it don't feel too well
The gang throwin' up we don't feel too well
Said my neck is freezin' cold, I don't feel too well
Momma hit my phone, say she worried 'bout my health, yeah
I don't feel too well
I don't feel too well
I don't feel too well, yeah
I don't feel too well
I don't feel too well

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
