[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
Shawty make me feel like the bestest
Make me feel like fuck all my exes
Make me feel like my last was a bozo
Got these bitches still trickin' off the logo
Ohhh, ha-ha, she pick it up and I'ma put it downtown
I'll be the realest nigga that she found
She keep a .40 on it just in case it goes down, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Just like I bought it nigga, you know I teach you all the rules, she my daughter nigga
You know I keep it with her too, that's what I taught her nigga
And last night, she fucked around, I nearly fought a nigga
You know, keep that day one like I'm a plug nigga
35s on a nigga, you can't stop a nigga
Me and N.O.R.E. got a story, got a battle for shawty
She tryna fuck me and Dolla, get a seven for me

[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
Shawty make me feel like the bestest
Make me feel like fuck all my exes
Make me feel like my last was a bozo
Got these bitches still trickin' off the logo
Ohhh, ha-ha, she pick it up and I'ma put it downtown
I'll be the realest nigga that she found
She keep a .40 on it just in case it goes down, oh yeah

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
Haven't heard of Tory Lanez, vocals is in
I got the Maybach with the Phantom and the chauffeur is in
Givenchy sprayed on the leather seats and Georgia, she a better peach
I brought my sand with me 'cause my sand from a better beach
They legalized bud and that's in Canada
I'ma have my lady with me like my manager
We gon' lock it all down, lock the parameter
You can't measure this love without diameter

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
She's mine
She's mine, she's mine, she's mine
I don't wanna sound crazy but
She's mine
She's mine, she's mine, she's mine
I don't wanna sound crazy but

[Post-Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
In the crib, I'm with her
In the mall, I'm with her
In the corner, I'm with her
I guess I just prefer
In the crib, I'm with her
In the mall, I'm with her
In the corner, I'm with her
I guess I just prefer, oh

[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
Shawty make me feel like the bestest
Make me feel like fuck all my exes
Make me feel like my last was a bozo
Got these bitches still trickin' off the logo
Ohhh, ha-ha, she pick it up and I'ma put it downtown
I'll be the realest nigga that she found
She keep a .40 on it just in case it goes down, oh yeah

[Verse 3: N.O.R.E.]
This is grownup rap (rap)
LeFrak, the place that I grew up at (yup, yo)
I got love for a lot of y'all (what)
My baby girl is realer than a lot of y'all
Feel like the A-Team, every time we face crime
We separate, it's cool 'cause we FaceTime
I'm rubbin' her hips, I love her waistline
So I'ma hit her with the hook and a bass line

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
She's mine
She's mine, she's mine, she's mine
I don't wanna sound crazy but
She's mine
She's mine, she's mine, she's mine
I don't wanna sound crazy but

[Post-Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
In the crib, I'm with her
In the morning, I'm with her
In the corner, I'm with her
I guess I just prefer
In the crib, I'm with her
In the morning, I'm with her
In the corner, I'm with her
I guess I just prefer, oh

[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
Shawty make me feel like the bestest
Make me feel like fuck all my exes
Make me feel like my last was a bozo
Got these bitches still trickin' off the logo
Ohhh, ha-ha, she pick it up and I'ma put it downtown
I'll be the realest nigga that she found
She keep a .40 on it just in case it goes down, oh yeah

[Outro: N.O.R.E.]
Ay yo, this is for all the homies out there living that life man
You be living that life, thinking that your homies gon' hold you down
I'ma tell you, when you get locked down and when nobody around
It's just gonna be your queen there, so treat your queen fair
You figure see all that?
Ya boy Nory man, hold it down, cup of season, half a gut
Yaahow
