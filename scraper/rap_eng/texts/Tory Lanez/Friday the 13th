[Intro]
Ay, pussys don't get pussy, nigga
Fuck niggas is outta luck, nigga
It's that double O11, player
Swavey, let's drive

[Verse 1]
Mind on money but the money on me
Maybach frontin;, ain’t frontin' on me
With the hoes on full, we ain’t runnin' on E
Nigga, you know what it is, nigga, you know what it ain't
Do I love her, do I love her? Nigga, you know what I think
Pourin' purple in the Sprite, nigga, you know what I drink
Nah I’m playin' but despite what a stupid nigga think
Homie, I be gettin' cash all night
Let a nigga hit, let me smash all night
I just pray to God that it last all night
She a 5 in the face but her ass alright
So the hat's on tight
I rub it, I get it, I touch it, I hit it
I’m fuckin', you fuckin'? Well fuck it, I'm with it
Let’s get it, let me get to business
And that’s when she did it like she wasn't kiddin'
Admitted it she love me, I told her, "It's stupid"
Then asked that bitch "Why?" and she told me, "It’s Cupid"
I said, "What the fuck, like that's what your excuse is?"
And then she said, "Yes" and I threw up the deuces
I’m sippin' on liquor, she smokin' on weed
I’m stuck in her throat, she chokin' on me
So shout out to yo niggas, acting like hoe niggas
Ridin' our dick 'cause we about to blow niggas, pause

[Chorus]
Said I'm ridin' with my 6′s on
I’m on what my niggas on
If you fuckin', give my niggas some
I can't party unless my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on

[Verse 2]
I need a bitch that’s famous and a girl that’s right
And a hoe that’s all in, pussy the bomb, Bin Laden
I hear she denied it, the bitch need a pilot
I ride like I was out of sight, the sky
But I’m high, I’m drunk, I’m Mr. Puff-the-Lye
But I’m fly as fuck, these hoes they love the guy
Why do I do this shit to a woman?
Love me when I'm givin' straight dick to a woman
If she pull that shit out, try to that shit south
Like a broad on fire, I’ll put that bitch out
Because I don’t need no bad bitch tryna lie to me
I live on a plane and I promise this shit nigga
Ain’t no chick gon' fly for free, why? I'm me
Eyes can see, a mad guy nigga on that shit like a mad fly nigga
Money ass long as a flat line nigga
And I’m in a bitch back like that spine, nigga, oh
Sippin' Baccardi 'cause I party
Now I got these bitches dreadin' like a yardi on my lardi, oh

[Chorus]
Said I'm ridin' with my 6′s on
I’m on what my niggas on
If you fuckin', give my niggas some
I can't party unless my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on
You know all my niggas on

[Outro]
Yeah nigga, shout out to my nigga Rimes for runnin' through yo bitches mind, nigga
Us young niggas too fun niggas, you ain't fuckin' with us, you ain't gettin' no funds, nigga
That's cool
Ay, shout out my nigga Sunny gettin' that money, tell yo girl to lay it down for me, ya did me?
'Cause we out while y'all young niggas runnin' shittin' on niggas out of style
Ya girl got two legs, two arms and a turquoise tong in my knapsack, nigga
She all the way in there, lame nigga, be quiet when a real nigga speak, nigga
