[Intro]
One Umbrella millionaire
Seen money, such a young nigga
Don, Fargo

[Chorus]
We was just some little niggas
On and off the corner, just wanna be a baller
I was just a little nigga, just a little nigga
And I hit my lil lick, same day I got rich
Then I drop 600, tell them bitches I'm big homie
Told them niggas they done turn me to the old me
Godfather, putting .40 in the '03
Fallin' down to my knees
Lord, let a nigga win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win

[Verse 1]
Let a young nigga win with a drop top Benz
2 door in the whip, we done popped off in it
I was scopin' the lick when they called Big Lin
Find out next month nigga locked up Swiss
I been gone since then, young nigga
Won't lie, have faith, trap house
I been on since then, young nigga
Don't lie, fourteen, cash out
And we roll since then, young nigga
Stay paid, nigga
Stay prayed up but it's always sin, young nigga
Let the song get sing
Nigga, I been poppin a .40 in Vegas
On top of your shawty, get naked
The way that a nigga be grindin'
You'd think that my women are only Jamaican
I know that she think she my only
But that bitch is only mistaken
You trickin', she know that you weak
And that's why that bitch don't be behavin'
Nigga, I'm amazin', send a subpoena
The name is Argentina and Jesus could save me
I see that you hatin', ignorin' a nigga
I'm keepin' it daily
For keepin' me posted
I give my people the pay
But niggas is evil
They really gon' get all their people in place, Swavey
So call off the ventin' and call up the Lord
And call up the waiter and tell all them bottles come to me with a sparkles
I got to bills when them bitches come out and they parkin' the car though
Now tell all them bitches to tell all them bitches they talkin' to  Fargo

[Chorus]
We was just some little niggas
On and off the corner, just wanna be a baller
I was just a little nigga, just a little nigga
And I hit my lil lick, same day I got rich
Then I drop 600, tell them bitches I'm big homie
Told them niggas they done turn me to the old me
Godfather, putting .40 in the '03
Fallin' down to my knees
Lord, let a nigga win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win

[Verse 2]
And the top get dropped and the spot get locked
I'm a dog, get guap and my broad give top
Nigga go so hard we should all get knocked
Nigga hatin' on us, they can all get shot
Young nigga, did it all for the Balmain
Whip foreign and the car leather
J$EAN in the " Wait"
Brrrr, I'm ignorin' when the call ring
High rise, big views in the high rise
We be livin' no more leasin', nigga
Uh, now it's 7k on that feature, nigga
And for any nigga with your side murkin'
Gonna pull up on 'em like I'm side skirtin'
Know July's comin' but the fire workin'
Grind certain, while my side hurtin'
Nigga broke, why? 'Cause they did not work it
Bad broad, and she be fire twerkin'
Like a north tape but it's the live version

[Bridge]
Like Ho, ho, ho
Fuck it, I'm killin' these niggas
Ho, ho, ho
Your style is a mini-me, nigga
Ho, ho, ho
Somebody put skill in these niggas
'Cause we steakin' for cheese
I ain't feelin' you niggas (we ain't feelin' you niggas)

[Chorus]
We was just some little niggas
On and off the corner, just wanna be a baller
I was just a little nigga, just a little nigga
And I hit my lil lick, same day I got rich
Then I drop 600, tell them bitches I'm big homie
Told them niggas they done turn me to the old me
Godfather, putting .40 in the '03
Fallin' down to my knees
Lord, let a nigga win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win win win
Let a young nigga win
Please Lord, let me win

[Outro]
Please Lord, let me win
Please Lord, let me win
