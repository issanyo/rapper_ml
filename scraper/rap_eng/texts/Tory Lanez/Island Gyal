[Intro: Raja]
Oh

Tory Lanez (oh)

[Verse 1: Raja]
Baby come my way now
No time to waste (no)
My heart been through the rain now
But you'll find a place, soon
Slow wine
Baby where was you this whole time?
Slow grind
Call me and I pick you up in no time
One condition
If you down baby don't go missing on me
Respect my wishes
If you down then I won't go missing on you

[Chorus: Raja]
Island gyal (don't need 4, not three, not two, just one)
Island gyal (you smoke trees let me on this shit [??] cause you)
Island gyal (don't need 4, not three, not two, just one)
Island gyal (you smoke trees let me on this shit [??] cause you)

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Mmm
Go slow for me baby
Fuck you down so low that it's like a limbo for me baby
In the sea and my system got me all going for you baby
Outta fuck but shots two teams yeah all for me baby (hmm)
You know I do, I do
All the vibes sip liquor like you, you know I do, I do
Still have feel wit you
Island gyal
Lost wit an island girl
Perfect timing girl
Soon you will fuck with me no say island gyal

[Chorus: Raja]
Island gyal (don't need 4, not three, not two, just one)

Island gyal (you smoke trees let me on this shit [??] cause you)

[Verse 3: Raja]
Cause you baddie won't you [??]
Baby you're the type I'd marry
You been on Caribbean vibes
Girl you make me feel alive, oh yeah
Girl you lookin' like Riri
Got her face make a TV
You're like a song on repeat
Stuck in my head, girl
Come to my bed, girl
Look at those legs, girl
Flawless
Ain't no way I could've known this
God said, "Praise him"
You sweet as sugar let me taste it
I just can't leave you alone
I see us building a home and it's true
Everyone falls in love sometimes
Just not me
And it's crazy cause
I fell in love for the very first time
And I mean that
Cause you girl I need that

[Chorus: Raja]
Island gyal (don't need 4, not three, not two, just one)
Island gyal (you smoke trees let me on this shit [??] cause you)
Island gyal (don't need 4, not three, not two, just one)
Island gyal (you smoke trees let me on this shit [??] cause you)

[Outro: Raja]
Drowning in liquor
Let's down in liquor baby
Drown in the liquor
Let's down in liquor baby
Roll some up
Let's get high
Roll some up
Let's get high
