[Verse 1]
What if I told you
You're like the bullet to my holster
Dangerous but I wanna hold you baby
You're there when I go through the motions
What if I told you
I could sling you off of my shoulder
Just like a shotgun to a soldier
I bought you all these guns and roses

[Bridge]
And baby, don't hold nothing back from me
I want all your guns and roses

[Hook]
She shot me right down
She shot me right away
She shot me right down
She shot me right away

[Verse 2]
What if I told you
When we make love its like war is going on
Don't leave me wounded in this battlefield
This fight for love, is for sure the prologue
What if I told you
Youâ€™re my morning cup of folgers
Would you sting me with the steam baby
Or be my guns and roses

[Bridge]
Don't hold nothing back from me
I ant all your guns and roses

[Hook]
She shot me right down
She shot me right away
She shot me right down
She shot me right away

Don't hold
(She shot me right away)
Nothing back from me
(She shot me right away)
I will hold
(She shot me right away)
Your guns and roses

[Outro]
Don't leave me alone baby
Shot me now I'm down weak
Don't leave me alone baby
I'm alone and I need another round
Don't leave me alone baby
Shot me now I'm down weak
Don't leave me alone baby
I'm alone and I need another round
