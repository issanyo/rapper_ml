[This]
Oh yeah
This is for the strippers, woah

[Verse 1]
She bad, niggas know that
Slim waist with a ass so fat
I'm in the club spendin' racks on racks
Gotta really cute smile and the tats on her back
She know what a nigga wan' do
Money up, fuck what you're goin' through
Doin' shit them other hoes won't do
Got the body of a goddess and it's all on you
Baby, show me what it is when you come around
I can take you to my crib, let me put it down
Lil mama got them eyes
I'ma do her right

[Chorus]
This is for the strippers, gon' head and tip her
Gon' head and tip her, gon' head and tip her
Came with ya niggas, gon' head and tip her
Gon' head and tip her, gon' head and tip her
Stripper, stripper music
Stripper, stripper music

[Verse 2]
She bad, I don't wanna touch her
Slow down, shawty, I don't wanna rush
Throwin' money in the club on the hush, baby
Bitch, I can get to know get to know ya
Let's go, let me show ya
Everythin' that I wanna do
You heard what i said
Your body would look dope in my bed
So baby, bring it back to my crib
And I promise, shawty, it can go down
We can go downtown 'cause baby, you know

[Chorus]
This is for the strippers, gon' head and tip her
Gon' head and tip her, gon' head and tip her
Came with ya niggas, gon' head and tip her
Gon' head and tip her, gon' head and tip her
Stripper, stripper music
Stripper, stripper music

[Outro]
Swavey, yeah
