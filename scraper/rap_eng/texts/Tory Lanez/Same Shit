[Hook: Tory Lanez]
I had to upgrade lil' mama
She fucking with them same ass niggas
Shit keep change and the money keep coming in the way y'all niggas
She wants to leave but can't get it with none of you same ass niggas
She need to stop fucking them same ass niggas
I ride with my same ass niggas
I'm down with my same ass niggas
Hit the town with my same ass niggas
You know I'm a same ass nigga
You know I'm a paid ass nigga
Don't fuck with them same ass niggas
Don't fuck with them same ass niggas
No

[Verse 1: Krept]
See me rolling from the gip side (same ass niggas)
Violate, catch a nigga on the flip side (same ass niggas)
Never let shit slide (same ass niggas)
See Bounce, see Weapz, see Tamez, see Muj (same ass niggas)
I rep the way, I rep the way
I rep the K, I rep the K
If I ever win a Grammy nigga
Twenty goons on the stage
22's on the Wraith
Any fools on a race
When I bust down the Rollie
Plenty jewels you wanna change
When are you gonna change?
All of you on a late night
When are you gonna stay?
Where are you? I'm in LA
Same niggas want a chase
Same niggas on your case (yeah)
But you just want something different for a change

[Verse 2: Konan]
They still on the same shit
And you need some changes
She don't know what my name is
But she know that I'm famous, yeah
Triple A on your pass
SnapChat vids with a glass
You see that friend you was last with
I don't like her, she's a cross (behave)
Grabbing on your hips
Your friends don't tag you in the pics
All them times I could've had you in a twist
But you think I'm tryna add you to the list (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Always got designers on
So sexy with sliders on
Don't know where my lighter's gone
But you know what my mind is on, yeah
