[Intro: Rich Homie Quan]
Hey, Spectacular
I might as well just go ahead and just spit 'tacular shit, bro
OG two timer, you ready?
You know why I'm here
Rich Homie, nigga!

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
You want all of her, she got all of you
All the things on the low, do her thing on the low
She don't love you, no, she don't love you, no
She don't love you, no, he don't love you, no
She be sending everything on the freeway
On the creep with her freak friends
On the three, on the three-way
I can see, I can, yeah, she don't love you

[Verse 1: Spectacular]
Late night, little mama hit my phone up
FaceTiming, said she wanna talk grown up
So I slid to the crib, 5 AM
Thirty minutes later, had the pussy jumping like the gym
Whipped it out, had to see what that mouth 'bout
Say I'm crazy 'cause I'm really what I'd rap 'bout, 'bout
Tongue flicking all over
Hit the G-spot, had her busting all over and over
Had her cumming all over
Give her nothing but the tip when she bent over
Terminator in that thing when I ain't sober
One Spec get your bitch, you call game over

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
You want all of her, she got all of you
All the things on the low, do her thing on the low
She don't love you, no, she don't love you, no
She don't love you, no, he don't love you, no
She be sending everything on the freeway
On the creep with her freak friends
On the three, on the three-way
I can see, I can, yeah, she don't love you

[Verse 2: Rich Homie Quan]
She don't love nothing about you
She don't even go out in public with you
Got a little money up out her, trying to get lots more
Whisper in her ear and she say I took heart like fox fur
She don't love nothing about you
She don't want nothing about you
I do anything just to make sure shawty straight
I do anything just to make sure we don't break up
I got too much invested, just me and her
She probably wanna leave, but I ain't giving up
Condom on, now, babies, girl, I can't give them up
No, I can't give them up, no, I can't give them up
You know, I go by R H Q
Turn up!

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
You want all of her, she got all of you
All the things on the low, do her thing on the low
She don't love you, no, she don't love you, no
She don't love you, no, he don't love you, no
She be sending everything on the freeway
On the creep with her freak friends
On the three, on the three-way
I can see, I can, yeah, she don't love you

[Verse 3: Compton Menace]
I see I'm tripping, it's probably behind a text
I'm always spazzing, it's probably behind a clit
Cocoa butter cheddar, them niggas know how I get
She say she love me when she send me all my shit
Stay at the crib with phone ringing, I don't ask a question
Her nigga mad and she ain't asking, guess he learned his lesson
And she want a real nigga that is never stressing
She ain't table-hopping, got her own money, bottle popping
She need a nigga to tell her ass the real
That fuck her inside the truck while I'm staying, oh well
Flip, I break it down for them, she only talk about the shit that she love
And it's never about what she hate

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
You want all of her, she got all of you
All the things on the low, do her thing on the low
She don't love you, no, she don't love you, no
She don't love you, no, he don't love you, no
She be sending everything on the freeway
On the creep with her freak friends
On the three, on the three-way
I can see, I can, yeah, she don't love you
