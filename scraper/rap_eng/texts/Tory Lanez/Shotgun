[Intro]
It's love, we just caught in the moment
Swavey, baby, yeah

[Verse 1]
Say you're frustrated, baby
Your main game, you do it right
I get so impatient, baby
Thinkin' 'bout you tonightt
Cock it back and lay your body on me
Squeeze like
I love it when you get trigger happy
With me tonight
I do what you want, girl
Yeah, you gon' be my tiger
And leave a lil some, girl
You know, you gotta do this

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream for you
Promise we'll be alright
Tonight you

[Chorus]
Bang like a shotgun
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow
Bang like a shotgun
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow

[Verse 2]
You say you're home waitin', baby
Shawty, please don't get me started now
I'm Mother Nature's baby
Get the key to my car and start it up
Load it, load it, load it, load it
So fast that we don't know where we are
I'll be there in a moment
You know everythin' I'm down for
Girl, we can do it where the wind blows
We can do it with your head up out the window
Anyway you like it, baby
I wanna make you scream
Oh, I wanna you scream
Oh, wanna make you shout

[Pre-Chorus]
I scream for you
Promise we'll be alright
Tonight you

[Chorus]
Bang like a shotgun
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow
Bang like a shotgun
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow
Bang, cock it low, cock it back, let it blow
