[Intro]
You ain't runnin', I called you on your phone
You ain't runnin', I called you on your phone
You ain't runnin', I called you on your phone
You ain't runnin', I called you on your phone

[Hook]
Say baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin'

[Verse 1]
I called you on your phone, you sent my shit to message
This can't be what you're on
I knew somethin' was wrong
I'm not gon' lie, I had to creep up to your home
Even the neighbors is saying lately (You actin' kinda shady)
Girl, you think your slick but no (You ain't runnin' game)
Call my phone up just to tell me that (No one is around you)
Girl, that's a damn shame, I had to call, say what's up with your day?
Mumble in your voice, heard that tremble in your cadence
Every single word seems to hit a nerve
'Cause you keep saying okay

[Hook]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say my fuckin' name
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my fuckin' name
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Say my fuckin' name
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Better say my

[Verse 2]
Where you at and who you with?
Open up, I'm at your crib, girl
You better tell me where you at
You say (over with my clique)
But I just called up Keisha and Lisa
Sayin' that they didn't even see ya
Better tell me where you are (Just got in the house)
How could you be inside if you was just ridin'?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold the fuck up
Who's, who's that in the back (Voice of someone else)
Girl, I know you're lying, you should quit while you're ahead
Instead of arguin' and whinin', I could see it

[Hook]
Say my fuckin' name
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say my fuckin' name
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Say my name, say my fuckin' name
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you, say baby, I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name
Say my name, say my name
Say my name, woah
You actin' kinda shady, ain't callin' me baby
Better say my

[Outro]
Know the girls say, all my girls say
And the girls say
Know the girls say and the girls say
And the girls gon' say
What they gon' say?
They say
I know you say that I am assuming things
Something's going down that's the way it seems
Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange
If nobody's holding you back from me
'Cause I know how you usually do
When you say everything to me times two
Why can't you just tell the truth
If somebody's there then tell me who
