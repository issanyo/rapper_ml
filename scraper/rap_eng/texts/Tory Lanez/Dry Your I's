[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, I just wanna tell you somethin'
Somethin' about it, somethin' about it
Real nigga, I come from this real shit
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey, you're something, this is the discussion
Daddy was a rollin' stone and I was just a youngin'
Mama she was broken, we ain't have too much of nothin'
Little sister cryin', dry your eyes girl, I'll go hustlin' just to get it

[Chorus]
Just dry your eyes, oh dry your eyes
Even I'd do wrong to make this life go right

[Verse 2]
Loner, motherfuckin' stoner
Mama say my clothes, they smell like resin marijuana
My reply is, "Mama, blame it on that corner"
Puttin' food up on the table and some ache up in my order
Mama I'm a soldier, .44 by my scrotum
Promise you won't cry when I go sell that soap and soda, oh no no

[Chorus]
Just dry your eyes, oh dry your eyes
Even I'd do wrong to make this life go right
