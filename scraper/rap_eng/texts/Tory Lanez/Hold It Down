[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Aye, aye, aye, aye, aye

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Shawty wanna ride with a west side nigga
Shawty wanna ride with a get right nigga
All of your friends say you got it for me
But I'm on the road, but with you is where I wanna be
Come get fly with a nigga
Roll a backwood, get high with a nigga
Sixteen sipping in my car but I'm all like (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
As long as you come by for the Winter
Make a young nigga wanna come vibe for the Winter
But I got it on the low though
All these tens on my niggas getting rolled up
Four fives saying hold up, woah
See I be on the road, doing twenty for a show
And these hoes wanna go
But I know that I gotta get back to the dough

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
And it's all
All that I wanted was you to come back to the crib
You to come back to the crib, lay your ass back on this dick
All I wanted was for you to relax in the whip
You to come back to the crib, lay your ass back on this dick
Lay your ass back on this dick, yeah

[Verse 2: Romeo Cash]
We in that Ferrari 'bout to skrrt off
Fuck you on the counter with your skirt off
I know that you love me, you tell me you do
And fuck what they say, it's all about you
Why you always worry about my timeline?
I don't love these bitches on my timeline
I know that you cared and I heard you the plug
So stop all the talking and pour me a cup
That pussy giving me lightning
She throw it at me like strikes nigga
She hold it down, she hold it down
And she know it's time when I come around

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
And it's all
All that I wanted was you to come back to the crib
You to come back to the crib, lay your ass back on this dick
All I wanted was for you to relax in the whip
You to come back to the crib, lay your ass back on this dick
Lay your ass back on this dick, yeah

[Bridge: Romeo Cash]
Fuck what they say
I need you forever
Don't ever leave
You're making me better
She hold it down she hold it down for me
She hold it down she hold it down for me
She hold it down she hold it down for me

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
And it's all
All that I wanted was you to come back to the crib
You to come back to the crib, lay your ass back on this dick
All I wanted was for you to relax in the whip
You to come back to the crib, lay your ass back on this dick
Lay your ass back on this dick, yeah
