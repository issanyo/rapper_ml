[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Out her seat, I had her dancin' like the new edition
I added all this money, bitch, I knew addition

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Out her seat, I had her dancin' like the new edition
Smokin' on the fifty like she knew addition
I added all this money, bitch, I knew addition
I'm baggin' shit, it's foreign, it's the new edition
Only hopping out of foreigns since the new edition
Bitch, don't do subtraction, all I do is addition
I don't sweat my bitches, I got no intentions
Designer shoppin', diamond coppin', all these new editions

[Verse 1: Taywill]
Fuck all these amatures, cum purple like amethyst
Two bad bitches like a nigga polyamorous
I'm on my shit again, hide your bitch again, just might hit again
I know you got a man and shit, I just been stickin' to the manuscript
I'm runnin' through the bands, they never hand me shit
I need a new league to hit, need a new bitch to hit
Ran through your chest but, uh, we left no fingerprints
China Doll, you shoulda seen, flow cold, my bitch Anemic
Blew a check, man out of Neiman's
Said she really needa say she really love me but I don't believe it
Bad bitch so I had to eat it, yeah

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Out her seat, I had her dancin' like the new edition
Smokin' on the fifty like she knew addition
I added all this money, bitch, I knew addition
I'm baggin' shit, it's foreign, it's the new edition
Only hopping out of foreigns since the new edition
Bitch, don't do subtraction, all I do is addition
I don't sweat my bitches, I got no intentions
Designer shoppin', diamond coppin', all these new editions

[Verse 2: Taywill]
Born a sinner born a loner
Codeine put me in a coma
Had a yellow bitch, she from Tacoma
We looked for love but we couldn't find it
She was close-minded but I don't mind it
A fashion nigga, I'm clothes minded
I been a flash, you need to be reminded?
Got Margiela on my shoe strings
Cop Balmain with my loose change
Two Jes√∫s  on my necklace, call me 2 Chainz
Thee clips, that's 36 chambers like a Wu-Tang
I'm on fire, nigga, Lu Kane, ride with my new thing
Light skin with a nose ring, had another one but that ho playin'
I'm back on the scene, chasin' this dream, so fresh and so clean
Irish Spring, finessin' your queen, my aura is king, got a newer vision
I'm Michael Bivins with that new edition
Dope like coke, that bag we was sniffin', on my new addiction
Dope like coke, that bag we was sniffin', on my new addiction
