[Sample]
Over babe
Put this, put this stand up in your trunk, babe
So buckle up cause this can get bumpy, babe
Honey, we gon' mess around and get a ticket, babe
I'm sayin', I'ma go, yellow light
Do it slow, red light
I'ma stop when I hear you say
Switch lanes, hit the signal
Take a break, hit the hazards when we park

[Verse 1]
Woah yeah, you're so wet, I'm slippin', I'm slidin'
Woah, babe, I cannot wait to get to your body
I don't want interruptions
Doors locked don't interrupt us
You can scream my name up in there
You can scream my name up in there

[Hook]
'Cause I like your style, have a grown man wishin'
I can take my keys, put it in the ignition
And you still on me, got your engine tickin'
But you gon' know my name by the way I whip it, yeah

[Bridge]
Woah, this ain't the time for second guessin'
What's goin' on in my body, woah woah
If you say you're mine then baby
You can't change your mind

[Verse 2]
We mix Hen with the 'tron, like so what I'm drunk
It's the freakin' weekend, I'ma have me some fun
Rollin' a blunt, OG my weed
And I'm tearin' that shit up when you fuckin' with me
I don't want interruptions
I just wanna get to the function, baby
I'm not one for assumptions
But I still want ya

[Hook]
'Cause I like your style, have a grown man wishin'
I can take my keys, put it in the ignition
And you still on me, got your engine tickin'
But you gon' know my name by the way I whip it, yeah

[Bridge]
Woah, this ain't the time for second guessin'
What's goin' on in my body, woah woah
If you say you're mine then baby
You can't change your mind

[Verse 3]
Girl, we off in the street
Put the windows up
Blast the radio
We not givin' a fuck
Cruisin' round and round
Girl, we livin' it up
We just thuggin' it out
We not givin' a fuck, fuck
Yeah yeah yeah
See it comin'

[Outro]
Now I'm not tryin' to be rude
But hey pretty girl I'm feelin' you
The way you do the things ya do
Reminds me of my Lexus coupe
That's why I'm all up in ya grill
Tryin' to get you to a hotel
You must be a football coach
The way you got me playin' the field
So baby gimme dat "Toot toot"
And lemme give ya that "Beep beep"
Runnin' her hands through my 'fro
Bouncin' on twenty fo's
While they sayin' on the radio
It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin' that body
Got every man in here wishin'
Sippin' on coke and rum (rum)
I'm like so what I'm drunk (drunk)
It's the freakin' weekend
Baby I'm about to have me some fun (fun)
