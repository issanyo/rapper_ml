[Verse 1]
Standing there looking at you from a long way
Passing me notes saying let's get gone
Class in session while we are in the hallway
Skip this class, let's get gone

[Hook]
I'm rolling this blunt up, baby
But touching your body feels like I'm high
Keep rolling that weed up, baby
Touching your body feels like I'm high

[Verse 2]
And I ain't here giving this shit to nobody
This feeling that feels electrifying
I can feel it, baby, would you let me ride?
Feel it baby, you on my mind

[Hook]
I'm rolling this blunt up, baby
But touching your body feels like I'm high
Keep rolling that weed up, baby
Touching your body feels like I'm high

[Verse 3]
Take my money, take my time
I've been off these streets all damn night
Now it's time I get back to you
And this is what I do

[Hook]
I'm rolling this blunt up, baby
But touching your body feels like I'm high
Keep rolling that weed up, baby
Touching your body feels like I'm high
