[Intro: Tory Lanez & Meek Mill & French Montana]
Can't stop what ya can't see, can ya
Meek Milly, North Philly
Canada, it's Fargo
Montana

[Chorus: Meek Mill & French Montana]
You need that work and I'll be there
Got my money straight
I'll be there, I'll be there
Got my money straight
I get that work from out the air
Got my money right
I'll be there, I'll be there
I said I got my money right
She want that work and I be there
Fuck her once fuck her twice
I'll be there, I'll be there
That pussy good and I be there
Ahhh fuck them once fuck them twice
I'll be there, I'll be there

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
My TO niggas out for murder
I ain't hoppin' in it if it came without the curtains
Woah, I'm off a stoke, smokin' purp'
Cause all my older Gâ€™s are either gone or doing thirty
I'ma ball for 'em, I got some niggas in the yard to take the charge for me
I'm ballin' hard, these soldiers fuckin', they go hard for me
I come correct, you niggas know I take that roof off
Wait, wait hold up I can't find the door
I'm talkin' two door McLaren, watch me lean with the endo
My whip so clean, yo bitch can fix her weave in my window
I'm whippin' the box, put my chick in the fox
Shoutin', "Fargo be the realest, shout to 6 and the dot"

[Chorus: Meek Mill & French Montana]
You need that work and I'll be there
Got my money straight
I'll be there, I'll be there
Got my money straight
I get that work from out the air
Got my money right
I'll be there, I'll be there
I said I got my money right
She want that work and I be there
Fuck them once, fuck them twice
I'll be there, I'll be there
That pussy good and I be there
Ahhhhhh
I'll be there, I'll be there
Ahh fuck them once, fuck them twice

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I'm whippin' out the Gran Coupe
My wrist on super Saiyan two
I got the Vegeta, I got Goku
You won't catch me out in traffic, I ain't local, no
Lord, I pray to God they never catch me chasin'
They know a nigga black, they wanna Wesley Snipe me
But where I'm headin', man, it's less than likely
Ha, that's why I'm laughin' at you niggas from the kitchen
I was itchin' when the fuck, I'm the realest
Might bring out the foreign, it depend how the weather look
Just a lil nigga but now look how the cheddar look
They look at me, I'm every risk that you never took, it's the Fargo
That's umbrella set
I make it look easy, don't I? It ain't easy

[Chorus: Meek Mill & French Montana]
You need that work and I'll be there
Got my money straight
I'll be there, I'll be there
Got my money straight
I get that work from out the air
Got my money right
I'll be there, I'll be there
I said I got my money right
She want that work and I be there
Fuck them once, fuck them twice
I'll be there, I'll be there
That pussy good and I be there
Ahhhhhh
I'll be there, I'll be there
Ahh fuck them once, fuck them twice

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
One Umbrella, nigga
Oh yeah, and shout out my nigga, Jay, nigga
Stay gettin' money, nigga
Fuck wrong with y'all niggas?
