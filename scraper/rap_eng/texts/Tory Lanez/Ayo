[Verse 1]
1 o'clock up in the mornin' and shawty, I'm fienin' for you to do somethin' we like to do
Girl, you got me in the moment and I gotta secret for you, baby, I'm on it, yeah
Shawty, I can't wait 'til the day when you whisperin' to me
To tell me you ready, tell me you ready

[Pre-Chorus]
I say look at what you do to me, this is somethin' new to me
And any time I'm thinkin' of it, thinkin' of you and me
Girl, I can't keep it patient for too long
'Cause your body callin' and that thing is too strong

[Chorus]
Girl, you body gone and I can hear it screamin' ayo
No, this ain't no game lil mama, but we can play though
Baby, let your hair blow, got me screamin' ayo
Girl, your body callin', I can hear it screamin' ayo
I hear it sayin' ayo
I hear it sayin' ayo

[Verse 2]
Girl, I wanna feel your body
This ain't no time to hold on, baby, no
'Cause it's just somethin' that got me screamin'
Hey girl, I'm on it

[Pre-Chorus]
I say look at what you do to me, this is somethin' new to me
And any time I'm thinkin' of it, thinkin' of you and me
I'm ready

[Chorus]
Girl, you body gone and I can hear it screamin' ayo
No, this ain't no game lil mama, but we can play though
Baby, let your hair blow, got me screamin' ayo
Girl, your body callin', I can hear it screamin' ayo
I hear it sayin' ayo
I hear it sayin' ayo

[Bridge]
Girl, you need me
I'm the only one who make you feel satisfied
You know you want it, I see your body
You want it from me, I hear your body
Come get it, babe, call me

[Chorus]
Girl, you body gone and I can hear it screamin' ayo
No, this ain't no game lil mama, but we can play though
Baby, let your hair blow, got me screamin' ayo
Girl, your body callin', I can hear it screamin' ayo
I hear it sayin' ayo
I hear it sayin' ayo
