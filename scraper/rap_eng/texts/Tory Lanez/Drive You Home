[Verse 1]
It's 3 o'clock on the dot, see you walking
School's out and the bell just ring
So I pulled up, hop out the truck
Said to you lil mama, you a precious thing
Let me drive you home or something
You replied said, you don't need nothing
But you live more than a couple of blocks
Get up on the drop and baby girl, don't be fronting
Girl, I look swavey in my ride
I ain't these other busters, girl I'm 18, plus I drive
And I can take you places you ain't ever been before
If that don't make you comfortable
I'll drive you to your door

[Chorus]
Baby, baby girl, you are a star
When you say you're walking far
You can hop in my car
And shawty I say
Baby, girl, I know you walking long
But you ain't got to walk alone
Lead you right to your door
And I'm gon' tell you
Baby, no I ain't these other guys
And I'm young but girl, I try
I can give you a ride
If you just let me
Baby, ain't tryna call myself your man
But shawty, you should
Give me a chance
And let me drive you home

[Verse 2]
We done talked for about ten minutes
Thinking if you should trust me
Girl, I tell you I'm a good guy
The type any mother would like
You got the body and the beauty of a good wife
So I'm tryna take you by the hand
Opening the door for you
I'm saying to hop in
There's just 1, 2, 3, 4
Steps until you up in my whip
I said it's 1, 2, 3, 4
I promise girl, that I'll get you there

[Chorus]
Baby, baby girl, you are a star
When you say you're walking far
You can hop in my car
And shawty I say
Baby, girl, I know you walking long
But you ain't got to walk alone
Lead you right to your door
And I'm gon' tell you
Baby, no I ain't these other guys
And I'm young but girl, I try
I can give you a ride
If you just let me
Baby, ain't tryna call myself your man
But shawty, you should
Give me a chance
And let me drive you home

[Bridge]
Baby girl, I promise that I'm gon' get you home
But I just can't sit back and let you walk alone
'Cause the more that we keep talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it, talkin' 'bout it
I know that you don't wanna walk away from me
But girl, you got my promise
That I'm gon' keep it honest
And girl, you know, I'm honored to be able to be
Driving you home

[Chorus]
Baby, baby girl, you are a star
When you say you're walking far
You can hop in my car
And shawty I say
Baby, girl, I know you walking long
But you ain't got to walk alone
Lead you right to your door
And I'm gon' tell you
Baby, no I ain't these other guys
And I'm young but girl, I try
I can give you a ride
If you just let me
Baby, ain't tryna call myself your man
But shawty, you should
Give me a chance
And let me drive you home

[Outro]
Yeah, let me drive you home, baby
Swavey, baby, yeah
It's that real R&B for you
