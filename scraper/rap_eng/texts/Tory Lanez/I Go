[Chorus]
They still at the side door
Foreign models follow everywhere that I go
I go, I go, I go, I go, everywhere that I go
Switchin' lanes, rather we ride slow
The way that I'm livin', it's so true man, listen, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I swear that baby, I know

[Verse 1]
Introduce you to the new-new-new-new-new-new-new
UK flow, it's a new day so another girl wet like blew-blew-blew-blew
And I'm, and I'm so foreign, so fly that I'm in there soarin'
No paint, just like a McLaren, she a freak but I need me a Lauren
Duffelbag full of euros in the belly of the bearau, niggas in the Merlot
Bad ting with her hair low, I'm gettin' money like a freak and my whip is a weirdo
Got boos in my car, it's a Phantom
We shine like a broad with a light on
They ain't never call way back when
Now all the tings wanna pour with the mandem
I send them shots back around-round-round-round-round
London goin' down-down-down-down-down
Let's have some fun tonight, right, lovin' life
Under the summer light, I gets me money right
You feel the rhythm when I get 'em and I got them
Hit the rest, need to find me a shy them
You talk, need a watch, no chop man
Your dad know, so you dealin' with a bodmon
Roll with a whole squad full of bad man
Oh bye bye to your bougie ban time
Coupe look like soup with the wanton
Sit back, blow L with the mandem, swave

[Chorus]
They still at the side door
Foreign models follow everywhere that I go
I go, I go, I go, I go, everywhere that I go
Switchin' lanes, rather we ride slow
The way that I'm livin', it's so true man, listen, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I swear that baby, I know

[Verse 2]
Sittin' back with a style full of badsies
Think about when the people used to judge me
Wanna miss call me and say, "Fuck me"
Lame 'cause they knew they want to plug me
Then I think back and I blame back
Tings tryna pull me like sling shot
In the Maybach, givin' money to the niggas tryna block
Tryna make them a quick shot
Roll out on the window, endo, even though the whip get low like limbo
For your info, kinfolk with me, hit me you get slice, no Kimbo
Your wife my bimbo, I just show her where her chin go
This that U-U-U-U-U-UK flow on you snitches
Man, I got too much time on my mind for me to catch and get away
Now let me leave and take your girl oxygen away
I'm sippin' coolers, that's the summer breeze
Somehow I can't recollect my memories
My bad, I said I'm UK swavey
So all the girls, they go UK crazy
My bad, I said I'm UK swavey
So all the girls, they go UK crazy

[Chorus]
They still at the side door
Foreign models follow everywhere that I go
I go, I go, I go, I go, everywhere that I go
Switchin' lanes, rather we ride slow
The way that I'm livin', it's so true man, listen, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I swear that baby, I know

[Outro]
Put the needle on the record, let it play, let it play, away
Foreign Models want to follow, let 'em play, let 'em play, away
I don't want to hear no chat
Ya hear blood?
Before I run in your house with a bump and end it
It's UK Lanez, yeah
Me and Sunny want all the girls, yeah
