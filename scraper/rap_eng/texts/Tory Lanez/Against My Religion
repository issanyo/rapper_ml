[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Riding around the city, leaving trails of gasoline
I know my hater's wouldn't mind to light it up
I ain't looking back so it ain't catching me
I can't let a hater bring me down, it's against my religion
Woah, oh, oh against my religion, woah, oh, oh

[Verse 1:  Kjay Cavalli]
Touch in the city, oh yeah, who fuckin' with me?
Congratulation, you graduated from jealous to hating
Fuck  whoever ain't riding, I know how shit work
These niggas won't fuck with you 'til your face on a shirt
I'm like, just cool with a nigga like me, that shit don't faze me
No it don't, I go by the things I've seen, don't try to play me
I know, I know, smiling in my face, wanna eat my plate
(KJay) Get haters every day, I don't know, put them on lay away

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Riding around the city, leaving trails of gasoline
I know my hater's wouldn't mind to light it up
I ain't looking back so it ain't catching me
I can't let a hater bring me down, it's against my religion
Woah, oh, oh against my religion, woah, oh
(Hold up, hold up)

[Verse 2:  Kjay Cavalli]
Running out your mouth, that's a problem, what you sniffin' dope?
I don't know, got that K and that will be your anecdote
They ain't learning, they ain't learning 'til you split they cantaloupe
All i know, you never know, plus your close friend could just fuck you over
It's over, I know when I see a hater, I'm like "What's up?"
Man I'm sober, pour up, I know when I see a hater, I'm like "What's up?"
