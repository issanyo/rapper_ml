[Intro]
Just lemme breathe

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground

[Verse 1]
I feel everybody needs somethin' from me
Me, I just feel like I need me some money
Or somethin' real soon, I need a deal soon
The only paper comin' are these fuckin' bills due
But wintertime comin', I ain't fuckin' chill proof
Mind tellin' me, "Chill, money's comin' real soon"
Still I feel I'm under like I'm stuck in milldew
Surrounded by fake people who don't speak the real truth
My girl hate me, think I'm creepin' with the duck
Or think I'm sleepin' with another but she don't even trust 'em
She wanna leave 'em, she don't love 'em
I understand, I just wanna let you know I wasn't, but fuck it then
Just know it's huggin' when it's huggin'
You always know it's real when it's comin' from the stomach
See this is how I feel, these the problems I'm confrontin'
I wish that I could clutch 'em and crush 'em, but fuck it

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground

[Verse 2]
I wake up every day up on the floor
Waitin' for the day I'm on my tour
Prayin' for today to be the score, maybe not, maybe sure
I wanna better myself, I wanna make me more
I wanna live good, I want the lake and shore
I want the sold out shows with a great applause
I wanna be the star player in the game of cards
But when I take the score, it's like they hate me more
And child openings ain't openin'
So he prays to God hopin' that'll help but some hope in him
Now he's feelin' low again, exploadin' and openin' on folks of him
All he wants to do is get his vocals spin
They don't even see him like it's invisible clothes he's in
They must love to tease and that's the reason they provokin' him
Cheesin' with the coldest grin, he don't like to show it so he holds it in
Just know that I know it, man, yeah

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground

[Bridge]
Look at me, I'm just like you
Got my own list of problems
Yeah, who gon' save me from myself?
Crashin' down, but I'm happy now, but it's

[Chorus]
I feel like I'm goin' crazy, love me or hate me
Who's gonna save me from myself?
When I feel like there's no one else
When it feels like there's no one left
To keep my feet on the ground
'Cause I'm happy now but I'm crashin' down
Who's gon' save me from myself?
To keep my feet on the ground
