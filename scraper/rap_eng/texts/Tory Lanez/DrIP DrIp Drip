[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Yo, Tory!
Got it on smash
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Okay

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez and makayla]
Stacks all on me
Big drip on me, ayy
Faucet on me, ayy
I'm dripping water, ayy, ayy
Know you notice, ayy
I love it when you tell me that you just the homie, ayy
'Cause I can't be committed with these stacks all on me (Stacks all)
Big drip on me, ayy (Drip on)
Nigga, you don't know me, ayy (You don't)
I'm not your homie (Not your)
Faucet on me (Faucet), I'm dripping water (Drippin')
She like it on me, ayy (She like that) , she like it on me (She like that)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip (She like that)
Iced out wrist
I just hit a lick
Highlight the wrist
That's how I like to drip
Drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Yo Tory!
I hit that corner and I'm bendin' y'know (Bendin')
She wanna fuck well it's dependin' y'know (Pendant)
'Cause I'm whipping that white girl, Kylie Jenner y'know (Kylie-yeah)
Put it on that flight and I just send her y'know (Send)
I can't get you right, five bands for the night
Baby, spend it on what you like, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Drip, drippin' on the side, big sippin', whip dippin'
Thick bitches wanna ride, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Yeah, and I might just fuck the baddest bitch all in the city, yeah
You's tryin' to fuck? Speak up 'cause I ain't politicin', yeah
You all in my condo ready to bust it and you brought it back
And if you ain't was ready to bust it, why you brought it then?
Dripped up, dripped up, dripped out
She gon' bust it at the Brickell penthouse
Said it ain't the 90s, but I put it all in your mouth
And it's hard to fit it all in your house with these

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Stacks all on me, ayy
Big drip on me, ayy
Faucet on me, ayy
I'm dripping water, ayy
Know you notice, ayy
I love it when you tell me that you just the homie, ayy
'Cause I can't be committed with these stacks all on me (Stacks all)
Big drip on me, ayy (Drip on)
Nigga, you don't know me, ayy (You don't)
I'm not your homie (I'm not your)
Faucet on me (Faucet), I'm dripping water (Drip on)
She like it on me (She like that), she like it on me (She like that)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Meek Mill]
Drip, drip, drip
Drip, drip, drip (She like that)
Iced out wrist

Drip, drip, drip (Drip, drip, drip)
Drip, drip, drip (Drip, drip, drip)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Racks all on me (Big racks, big racks)
Me and my woadies (Me and my woadies)
Bad bitch wit' me (Bad bitch, bad bitch)
Fuckin' her homies (Fucking all on me)
Choppa in the mansion (Brr, brr)
Feeling like Tony (Feeling like)
Sosa, bitch I'm big homie (Yeah)
Racks on me, had to go in my bag (Get in yo' bag)
Bad bitches been fucking me fast (Fucking me fast)
New blue faces up in my jeans
Drip, drip like I live in a sink
New Phantom, don't step on this mink
Broke niggas gotta pardon my swag (S'cuse me)
All my Miami Spanish bitches goin' wild
I left prison in a chopper, they like, "How?"
Had a threesome the same day I went to trial
Then I'm back in this lick, like

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez & Meek Mill]
Stacks all on me, ayy (Big racks, big racks)
Big drip on me, ayy (Drip, drip)
Faucet on me, ayy (Faucet)
