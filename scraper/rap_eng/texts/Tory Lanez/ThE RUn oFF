[Intro]
Yo Tory
Got it on smash
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Ay, It's a lot of pussy ass niggas tryna take my bitch and run off
30 in the bag must've caught it at the cut off
Feds pulled me over, took my weed and took my gun off
I know he the plug, but I swear I'm 'bout to run off on that nigga

[Verse 1]
I just light that bitch and hit my blunt off
You know what it is, all in my city, bitch you don't know
She keep saying I'm cocky, bitch it's just the way I come off
And I'm from Toronto I can't sleep without my gun on me
Popping with these ones on me, yeah
It's a lot of fun when the funds on me, yeah, yeah
Henny got me drunk all week
I can never ever let 'em get one up on me

[Chorus]
Still these pussy ass niggas tryna take my bitch and run off
30 in the bag must've caught it at the cut off
Feds pulled me over, took my weed and took my gun off
I know he the plug, but I swear I'm 'bout to run off on that nigga

[Post-Chorus]
They lit the scene and I can't leave
Droppin' the top and I can't leave
Serious, no, you can't be
Err, you can't be, you can't be

[Interlude]
Alright, cool
Yo Tory
I just feel so fucking free, you know what I'm sayin'
I ain't felt this free in a while
We ain't had this much fun in a while

[Verse 3]
Ayy, well, look I love my baby and I love my baby mama
But, it's like every time I see her, it be crazy drama
Last week, she damn near pulled out my .380 on me
In the sun, she'll probably still say I act shady on her
Ah ha ha, yeah
Baby, I'ma smoke this marijuana
And do what I wanna
Bitch, I ball, money tall, like that bitch Juwanna
I be all off in the streets, I'm doin' my thing and fucking these freaks, I got the .5 on me
Big thigh on me
She wanna ride on me, lil' mama, come slide on me
I'm on that big dawg status and we got them fives on Vs
And I keep my fire on me
'Cause even your eyes can see, it's the

[Chorus]
Pussy ass niggas tryna take my bitch and run off
30 in the bag must've caught it at the cut off
Feds pulled me over, took my weed and took my gun off
I know he the plug, but I swear I'm 'bout to run off on that nigga

[Post-Chorus]
They lit the scene and I can't leave
Droppin' the top and I can't leave
Serious, no, you can't be
Err, you can't be, you can't be
