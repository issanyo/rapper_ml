I had to leave me a bitch, she way too emotional/
Diamonds they dance on my wrist, they way too emotional/
I got shooters, say they saw the shooter, this shit is emotional/
My lil one just hopped out, he poppin the clip, them niggas emotional/

I had to leave me a bitch, she way too emotional/
Diamonds they dance on my wrist, they way too emotional/
I got shooters, say they saw the shooter, this shit is emotional/
My lil one just hopped out, he poppin the clip, them niggas emotional/


[Verse 1] (Pimpton)
Awn….They’ll never stop tryn’a deceive us/
Awn...The booty was real thank you Jesus/
No precipice, I go the deepest/
My lil niggas hungry, we need this/
Can’t go back to how it was when you feasting/
Shine like a star from above, I’m the beacon/
Tell all my bitches to chill, I don’t need em/
Still might murk a bitch if I find out she cheating/
Light up my J and go nuts like I’m pecan (peeking)/
U wouldn’t believe what I did for my shot/
U couldn’t conceive all the schemes that I plot/
When my haters get popped, just don't ask if I'm shocked/
Put ya bitch on my team now the gettin the gwap/

[Verse 2]
So pop that pussy for me mama, let me see you get emotional/
It’s gon be a cold winter, I wear that pussy like an overcoat/
I hit that from the back, n watch shawty drive that stick from coast to coast/
All I do win, muhphuka I'm suppose to boast/
My niggas go crazy it’s nothing/
Get iced at the push of that button/
The clip fully loaded, it’s buzzin/
Agitate god and get smashed like a pumpkin/
I ain’t got patience, I want it right now/
Need hundreds on hundreds on thousands of pounds/
Might fuk on your bitch if she fuk wit my sound/
These niggas emotional, chop em all down//
