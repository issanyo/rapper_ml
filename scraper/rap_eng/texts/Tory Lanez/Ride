[Intro]
Yeah nigga, motherfuck it is
Fargo (?) racks my nigga
Your own brother GDS shit my nigga
Act like he don't know better story the fuck up nigga
Fuck 'em

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Bitch you know what's up
If we got some ridin' with you niggas
And that .40 tucked
Case I get to slidin' with you niggas
And you know what's up
All I do is ride for my niggas
And you know it's up
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Young nigga from the dirty part
Dirty jeans tryna be a star
Ferrari drivin' down the boulevard
Out here grindin' gonna make it far
Remember sleeping where the junkies stay
Remember chillin' where the gunners stay
Remember the nights making wops on the block (?) they say (?) for like 30 days
Remember seeing chick with the pretty face
She wanna fuck cause the dirty cake
Shoutout my nigga that tory lanez
Shoot to kill, gunners stocked in my gang
I'm stackin' my money from knee high
She wanna fuck cause of d.i
Bitch you can't see us
Pull off and skrt, onomatopoeia
My niggas are (?) more bitches follow him than a bee hive
My nigga got 6, fuck it I might just run up on a Ci
I'm doin' my Diddy boy y'all better stay out my business
That .40 go bop-bop-bop-bop now y'all niggas see why

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Bitch you know what's up
If we got some ridin' with you niggas
And that .40 tucked
Case I get to slidin' with you niggas
And you know what's up
All I do is ride for my niggas
And you know it's up
Bitch I got that .40 tucked
(x2)

[Verse 2]
These bitches don't care about him
And these niggas don't worry bout him
I'm no limits, so bout it bout it
I'm smokin' loud, you won't hear about it
Don't break a bitch, don't got no feelin's
Made a livin' off dope dealin'
In the 6 with my woes chillin'
Cabana party got no ceilin's
Got Tory Lanez all on the track
Had to go throw racks on it
Fuck with G.D.S and it's a wrap
If we can't find him then throw a pack on him
Maybe a 4 and a half on him
Either way he gon' get eat like Frito Lay
Niggas get shot just like everyday
But these niggas don't want drama like Mary J
Sweet up the Mary Kate
Niggas know that I push heavy weight
Cuttin' these bricks like a wedding cake
In the Pyrex, watch it marinate
Took the bitch a serenade
Now I'm fuckin' that bitch watch me demonstrate
I walk around with the .40 tucked
Capo in here, he know what's up
If you get close then the .40 bust
Bitch blowin' up, the cops showin' up

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Bitch you know what's up
If we got some ridin' with you niggas
And that .40 tucked
Case I get to slidin' with you niggas
And you know what's up
All I do is ride for my niggas
And you know it's up
Bitch I got that .40 tucked
