[Chorus]
Baby we need time away
Take you to a finer day
Let me buy you the designer things
Everything you wasn't tryna pay
Baby we can find a way
Let me think about and find a way
'Cause baby
Baby it's a better way
And maybe I can get you everything

[Verse]
And baby we need time away
Something free and nothing that we're boutta pay
I'm thinking 'bout it me and you in finer things
Thinking 'bout covering your eyes in designer frames
And I might pull up on your side, what I'm tryna say
Corny bitches don't like your vibe they just tryna hate
Tryna pull up G5 on that kinda day
I hit the Instagram live with my fuckin' bae
I might just spend like twenty-five for the fuckin' things
And tell her blow another five 'cause we running things, ay

[Chorus]
Baby we need time away
Take you to a finer day
Let me buy you the designer things
Everything you wasn't tryna pay
Baby we can find a way
Let me think about and find a way
'Cause baby
Baby it's a better way
And maybe I can get you everything
