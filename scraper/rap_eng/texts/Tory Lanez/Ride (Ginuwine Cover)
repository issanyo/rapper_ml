[Hook]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
You want it, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle is waitin', come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it

[Verse]
See you're frustrated, baby, your man can't do you right
I get so excited, baby, just to get a good night
See, we don't get a move, don't get the move
See, we can get this [?] and get this crunk, baby
Hit you with that funky sound
That's how you know it's going down
Now we up in your city, baby, I'm a TO nigga flexing
Im just tryna fuck every girl, baby, that live in Austin, Texas

[Hook]
If you're horny, let's do it, ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin', come and jump on it
