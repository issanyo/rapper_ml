[Intro]
Aw yeah, bro
No, I'm not an intruder
I'm just joinin' in intercourse
With the daughters of America

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm so cool, I be ridin' all swavey
Chillin' with some girls all they all Caucasian
I live in the colours, I see all y'all chasin'
And if you don't believe me, I say all y'all racist
Been thinkin' 'bout this plan for a long time
I told my boss F you, man, I'm gon' ride
And all them thievin', I'm believin', chicks that think that I'm conceited
Tryna pull a Michael Jackson while they take my dick and beat it
Here's a middle finger for you, hope you like it
Standin' on the ceilin', feelin' higher than a fly kid
And I say F your friends 'cause they always up in my shit
And I been here so long, long that I'm sky sick
I'm so swavey, they say that time is of the essence
No need to worry, baby, I am of the freshness
Would it be the diamonds on my necklace?
That's my time tell, come home then rewind

[Chorus]
I need a place we can go, get away
It's a place where all my problems go, Swavey
I need a place we can go, get away
It's a place where all my problems go, Swavey
Ready to ride, woo
Ready to ride, ready to ride

[Verse 2]
Man, been drivin' down the runway the wrong way
Local radio lettin' my song play
Canadian jewellery on my arm, eh
All of the lights got me feelin' like a Kanye
It's been a long day, my diamonds dancin'
So your girl wanna be my prom date, yeah, long as she bomb, hey hey hey
Tell your friends to tell they friends friends friends
That I'm multiplyin' money by the tens, tens, tens
This the move that we makin', it's the money you see
Say you love bein' you, when I know you would love to be me
It's easy for you to try to read me
I keep it funky, fresh and freezy
Never greezy, you ain't see me
Man, I just need to be up on a resort of some sort
I want girls who come forth and be part of my comfort
I'm a young nigga, I love sports, I love my girl but I plug whores
I make it fast like jump doors, take all the cash, feel no remorse

[Chorus]
I need a place we can go, get away
It's a place where all my problems go, Swavey
I need a place we can go, get away
It's a place where all my problems go, Swavey
Ready to ride, ready to ride
Ready to ride, ready to ride
