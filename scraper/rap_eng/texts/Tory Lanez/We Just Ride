[Verse 1: RUSSELL]
You can catch me in an orange Pantanna with a swagger elite
In a normal whip, sittin in the pasindger seat
And maybe you can roll with me, cruisin down the whole city
So pretty, just chillin and bumpin old Biggi
Met with Tory, so I got the streets poppin
Drove around the citys from Tokio to Mississippi
We never look back, we face the road
Just a couple young teens with no place to go
Took my friends with me, soon got enough after
I hated paying $3 for a buss transfer
So I'd sit up in my whip with my crew, and tell m, when I'm famous, Imma get you a new
Clean whip to crues the streets, in that, I'd be a live threat
But he'd be up under the will, cause I don't drive yet
Talkin bout the future, when I'm blown up and that
So I can go and turn that lil tiney whip to a Phantom

[Chorus: RUSSELL]
We just ride, cops see under the dash
Throgh your hand back, I prommised the rest
We just ride, know we do it and run it
Just chill on the road, while music be bumpin

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
And you can catch me in my Ralph Laurents, so look out for me, spot me by the balkany
Rather be on my different Ms, louder than your little sister is
Mister Mister take your little sister from her inisents
Yeah, I sware I'm feelin bigger than ever
Since I've been thinkin propellers
Make a fella fly, like damb, man, I get hella high
I be higher than an addict in the sky
My cool fool's super cool fools shoes on
Blue armored whip crush like crutons
My whole crew arms, I think I might do time
We used to skateboard, and matter a fact, we hated cars
I laugh about it cause I'm older now
And now them windows getting colder and skateboards don't hold you down
Be what I be, I'm layed back gettin them aged racks
I'm famous, Maybacks in my lane, you feel me
Tory!

[Chorus: RUSSELL]
We just ride, cops see under the dash
Throgh your hand back, I prommised the rest
We just ride, know we do it and run it
Just chill on the road, while music be bumpin
