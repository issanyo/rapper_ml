[Intro: Casey Veggies]
Yeah, Young Veggies aw man, yeah

[Verse 1: Casey Veggies]
What's your name girl? Where you from?
I just want you to dance girl, this your song
Who made your pants girl, I like the cut
I got my own brand girl, I look at that type of stuff
What type of things are you into, tell me what's your zodiac
Do it like all your tires flat, put it in neutral push from the back
[?] might be [?]
Start going hard, turn it up a notch
I met one side of her then at night time she showed me someone else
I can't get enough of that, girl rewind and run it back
I need a chick that's bout a hundred stacks
I'm swagged up, I'm a heart attack
Young Veggies I'm good for that
Girl didn't your momma tell ya
Real recognize real, that's why I'm looking so familiar
It's Peas N Carrots fresh and frozen, put you onto something new
I been working super hard like five years trapped up in the booth
Pulling up on in an Audi Coop, I just caught that alley oop
Ain't no telling what I might do
Girl bring your friends when I invite you

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
[?]
[?] singing the [?]
[?]
And I want it all, I want it all
[?] I can't get enough
[?] I can't get enough
[?] I can't get enough
[?] just can't get enough
[?] can't get enough
[?]

[Verse 2: Casey Veggies]
It's like [?] when I ride
Young Veggies gettin' known, got winners on the squad
I be doing my stuff, can't get enough
Got a girl run track, know she got a nice butt
Hitting weights I'm buff, youngest nigga in the club
Pull up in a truck, she was tryna see what's up
She be falling in love like a chick in a Benz
Everything that I spend get it back when I win
Can't get enough, can't get enough
Can't get enough, can't get enough
[?] got that
I think it's nuts
Bout that life
And she's rolling with us

[Hook: Tory Lanez]

[Verse 3: Casey Veggies]
We all gon' drink and we all gon' smoke
Yeah we all got problems but we all gon' grow
I can free your mind, I wanna free your mind
Got hoes on my line, she like boy wanna ride
I could take you all the places that you wanna go
Front row to the people that you wanna see
If you give me that chance I could free your mind
Just make your mind up what you wanna be
Told her I need that so she give it up
Give me some feedback, let me know what's up
Spend your whole life tryna get it off
When you finally got that could you get enough

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
