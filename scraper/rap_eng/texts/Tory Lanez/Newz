[Hook: Prospectt]
I, just heard the news
You got a hard time tryna choose
I, just heard the news
You got a hard time tryna choose
Do he love you love you?
Like I love you love you
Do he fuck you fuck you?
Like I fuck you fuck you
I, just heard the news
You got a hard time tryna choose

[Verse 1: Prospectt]
I make music for these baddies and the paper trappers
All my niggas eating good you should see the platters
Got a chick out in Atlanta who goin' ham with hammers
We in defeated in the club that shit hang on banner
Woah they get a video in Haiti then flew in to Punta Cana
I'm gettin' a status man why I expected the propaganda
You karaoke niggas don't impress me no
Word in Miami don't test me though
Lil Haiti uptown what I'm claim on
Cause I'm really Haitian with them Haitians
There you go

[Hook: Prospectt]
I, just heard the news
You got a hard time tryna choose
I, just heard the news
You got a hard time tryna choose
Do he love you love you?
Like I love you love you
Do he fuck you fuck you?
Like I fuck you fuck you
I, just heard the news
You got a hard time tryna choose

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I, just heard the news
Self made nigga I ain't paying back the dues
I, leave witchu and we can't call a truce
I came with some dimes you came with some mulah fuck are yous?
I, got two bad bitches
I, bumped the bed spring up to mattresses
I, got lil mama acting like a savage
She thought she'd never fuck with me I'm way above the averages
I Know
I, pull up in the Rolls
Duckin TMZ I'm tryin' not to get exposed
Shuffling my hoes in irreversible doors
I been killin' with these verses think I'm rehearsin' the flows
This just me and lil [?] she been reworking the stove
It's just me and lil bro that's me working at more shit
Pop a perc and pop that pussy for me in the Rolls
She know how I roll she gon do it for me in the Rove
Hardly ever sold but she said she want some closure
I gave her no disclosure but fucked her on the sofa

You got a hard time tryna choose
I, just heard the news
You got a hard time tryna choose
Do he love you love you?
Like I love you love you
