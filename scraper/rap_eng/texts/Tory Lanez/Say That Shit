[Pre-Chorus]
You don't love me, you just say that shit
You just say that shit to fuck with me
Unlucky me, I listened girl
Damn, I really wish you wouldn't say that shit
'Cause I swear every time you say that shit
Swear the room move in slow motion, I don't know how to control it
When you say that shit, yeah, I can't figure if you love me or it's nothin'
Let me know because

[Chorus]
It's all how you say that shit
The way you say you love me but I know you really hate me
Look, it's all how you say that shit
You don't really love me, you just learned to tolerate me
Look, it's all how you say that shit
Now I hear you gon' move in distance
You gon' tell me that we different
But that's all that you say
You ain't really love me, you just learned to tolerate me
And it's all how you

[Verse 1]
Uh, love a nigga
Talk on road is that you out especially fuckin' niggas
Look, I made my mistakes, tthe ones I’m stuck, I'm stuck here wit ‘em
The reason why I'm stuck here with ya, shit don’t really fuckin' change
A nigga since last time I saw you, me just tryna be honest and tell ya
That weekend I’ll call ya, you just holdin' your feelings and started tellin' me all of your business
And that’s when a young nigga gotta get money
I’m sorry I’m selfish, I’m sorry I’m selfish, I'm sorry
Damn, am I sayin' too much? Am I doin' too little?
Are you in the middle? I’m playin' too much
Yeah, but if it’s real then say that shit
And if it’s not then keep it real and save that shit

[Chorus]
It's all how you say that shit
The way you say you love me but I know you really hate me
Look, it's all how you say that shit
You don't really love me, you just learned to tolerate me
Look, it's all how you say that shit
Now I hear you gon' move in distance
You gon' tell me that we different
But that's all that you say
You ain't really love me, you just learned to tolerate me
And it's all how you

[Verse 2]
Yeah, told her I’m runnin' a mission
No lovin', just money intentions
Oh, now here you come with this bitchin'
I know where it’s goin'
I know where it’s endin'
Fuck it, let’s skip all the arguin'
Harvestin' shit into somethin' that benefis
All of my bitches that wanna get mine
Better stay with me on the low
I need a comfort that I am not talkin'
To one that sit back at the bed when I sleep on the road
I been keepin' all the secrets
I know you know that I got women I keep on the low
You know we move through the city like general pimpin'
While women just creep on the low
Me? I’m just rollin', I’m hopin' my soon to be finished
Relationship turned into somethin' that grow
Coulda been makin' this somethin'
I coulda been fussin' about makin' us lovers
But fuck it, I’m back on this playin' shit, though
I made mistakes and made that shit
You say you love me, save that shit
Don’t say that shit

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't love me, you just say that shit
You just say that shit to fuck with me
Unlucky me, I listened girl
Damn, I really wish you wouldn't say that shit
'Cause I swear every time you say that shit
Swear the room move in slow motion, I don't know how to control it
When you say that shit, yeah, I can't figure if you love me or it's nothin'
Let me know because

[Chorus]
It's all how you say that shit
The way you say you love me but I know you really hate me
Look, it's all how you say that shit
You don't really love me, you just learned to tolerate me
Look, it's all how you say that shit
Now I hear you gon' move in distance
You gon' tell me that we different
But that's all that you say
You ain't really love me, you just learned to tolerate me
And it's all how you
