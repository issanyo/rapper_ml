[Verse 1]
How do I tell you to when it's just all a lie?
I don't even need you now, feel like I'm living to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
When we get closer, I love you
But when it's all over, don't love ya no more
I say fuck it's, it's fucked up
No baby, it's all fucked up
Don't even need to have to say go
Get your highs and your leather, take off
'Cause I just wanna take you there, baby
Let me take you there

[Chorus]
Sextasy, you next to me
Love me down, I love the sound

[Verse 2]
You don't know what I can do with your body
You don't know just how I feel when you're naughty

[Pre-Chorus]
When we get closer, I love you
But when it's all over, don't love ya no more
I say fuck it's, it's fucked up
No baby, it's all fucked up
Don't even need to have to say go
Get your highs and your leather, take off
You just wanna touch
Touch me, babe

[Chorus]
Sextasy, you next to me
Love me down, I love the sound
Sextasy, you next to me
Love me down, I love the sound
