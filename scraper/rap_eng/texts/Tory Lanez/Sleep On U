[HOOK by Tory Lanez]
I can sleep on you
I apologize but I got my eyes
I got a shot ain't got a lot on you
Just call me up and you know I'll come
Long as you keep shit 100
Oh-ahahahhhaoh
Keep shit 100
Oh-Oh-Oh
She keep it 100

[Verse 1: Erratic Assassin]
She call me daddy like a father figure
I can do it like that
I give her tongue and then I give her fingers
I just do it like that
She hittin' high notes she a fuckin' singer
I can do it like that
She give me brain then she give me her stinger
I just do it like that
I make her fall in love cause I got all the good shit
I got the clothes got the purp give her good dick
Let her ride shotgun in the Genesis
Then we go and spend racks for the hell of it
She getting drunk now she wanna fuck me doin' tricks
Bringin' whole new meanin' to hittin' licks
She trappin' out with me like we be fuckin' moving bricks
Makin' benefits

[HOOK]

[Verse 2]
Dirty Fanta keep me motivated
Gets me high like a motherfuckin' elevator
Shit talkers not allowed near us no
Shit talkers them people I don't trust no
Oh shit, leave her speechless after sex
Goin' in like a dino call me erratic rex
Let's keep this simple, don't make this complex
I just need you to keep it 100
Girl, better save some for me
Off that lean I be eatin' up the pussy
She popped a xan I popped a molly now we screwed up
Drippin' juices from her kitty hallelujah
Swear her pussy ranked up call of duty
Make it talk it say my name like it knew me
Fuckin' in my new j's I go stupid
We lucid

[HOOK]
