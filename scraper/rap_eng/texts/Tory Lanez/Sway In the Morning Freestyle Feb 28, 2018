Yeah
New York City stand the fuck up
Toronto stand up
Let's Rock

My Glock crazy
Fiends on my block brazy
A lot of niggas sending shots that could not faze me
Cops movin, niggas shootin at the ops daily
My momma died but my pop raised me
The block made me
Tuck grips and serve rocks daily
I started scammin, had my bitches doin drops crazy
Listen, i got a vision of an all white wrath with the inside interior seat color of hot gravy
Have it lookin like a dinner when im driving
My grip like my dick it get bigger when i slide in
45th skippin like flipper on the glide in (?)
Comin through the spot jewels drippin like poseidon
Different bitches trippin trynna get up right beside em
Im S5fif driving out the sun roof
Clique flyin while my nigga stick shift and try to switch irons
He was trippin gear shiftin let his bitch drive it
Im talkin violation
My little niggas out here robbin niggas for the love of ballin like Sanaa Lathan
And they some cold-hearted niggas but thats how i raised em
Scrape a op off the board boy you dry erase em
Put his hands on your brother? You gotta fade him
He put his hands on your sister its annihilation
Im in the sky racin, Henny shot chasin
Bad bitches one plan and thats to end up on the yachts naked
Stand on your block fuck how the ops take it
I let the uz (ooze) down his throat like he shot chasin
But if we grapple dog, i beat your face red and white have it lookin like i just bit the apple off
My momma died i lost my mind and couldn't cope with it
And niggas kept on pokin at my open shit
So i sold dope and moved O's and made hope of it
And got busy with any nigga that made a joke of it
Made a little change, boom bam, studio equipped
Fast forward couple years later sittin in them range rover tints
My life is crazy, ice is hazy, over night flight how to expedite your lady
For the right price i can get you striked its crazy
Money height like dwhite on a flight with KD
Crazy how i pulled up in the drop rolls
Pocket rocket in my sneaker right up where the sock rolls
I keep it on me and my block knows
Because without it somethings missing like the nose ring on pacs nose
Bandana tied, blam blam your ride, rob van dam the man inside
That you get your hand to drive
Im so sick i spit flows with a whole infection
Times hard and niggas gotta split the O's in sections
No burners like fucking hoes no protection
But thats rare like a fatass with no injection
Presidential kush it coulda took the whole election
I got a whole collection of a home grown selection
Me and broke niggas 2 things with no connection
I can't seem em like the facetime with no reception
Im crazy im going ballistic
For the gravy, ill let it go on your biscuit
From the screw face, cap black, you know that im twisted
Stupid aim, my trigger finger going autistic
So im aiming for the headshot, you could see the moisture
Put shells in your mouth like you eating oysters
I book niggas librarian quick
And put them things on the boat like nigerian kids
Ima black mac hoodie up, i ain't do it for the look enough
Until i got the ramada poppin and booked it up
The car man you gotta look it up
I hustle drugs like me on a song nigga i hook it up
I shook it up and made a wish with it
Then my enemies started dying from young niggas in knicks fitteds
That sell dope so they can go and cop the kicks with it
I pop a nigga whole chick and take flicks wit it
But im not a pornstar
I hit the onstar
Im trynna find me some wet pussy and a long jaw
Damn
Im a damn bastard
21 guns like im a damn savage
With 2 of em i can make both your mans catch it
Then pay a donation pay both your mans caskets
(?)
With this pump in my bait(?)
Just to view the body slumped in the state
Yo my ops took so many friends from me
I got more hate for them niggas than Ted Bundy
Drama in my mind, who gun get this lead from me?
Fuck niggas up and laugh like something i said funny
Its been a long minute yeah its been a long time
I gotta lotta bitches yeah this shit a long line
My nuts swinging like them things from the dog pound
These niggas say they gettin money need to calm down
Cause listen nigga
Ill break fast and scramble and break fast so all im missin is the cheese and the salmon and baked mash
These niggas say the singing and rappin is straight trash
You hearin tory singin and rappin you pay cash
My album bout to drop nigga
Im about to pop nigga
How i shoot guns and go platinum off pop nigga
This off top but i ain't gunna stop man
I stay on d block like i started as the Lox nigga
I used to fear that the bitches didn't like me
And then i got bread and only niggas didn't like me
But niggas should like me, i was hittin niggas wifey
In the kitchen hand frost bitten wrist icey
Chick pricey, but i fuck a different one every night
My dick sheisty
My drive through money is crumpin its gettin hyphy
My McDonalds order is little mcspicy
They really just niced me
I hit bella and ella in the same night
When they hear this freestyle they gon say your game tight
Alotta niggas they ain't right in they mind i mean
Let alone written they lines, but take this
Im the only artist you know can sing to your bitch
And then talk that greezy its really that easy
And you gon believe me you know i gets busy nigga
Cause i stay next to the keys just like swizzy nigga
A nigga think im pussy, i like that shit betta so the feelin less expected when i get the nigga
Im hot style about to break the turn tables
You think im clearing evidence the way i burn paper
They know i earn paper as soon as i learn paper
The trap house crack smoke smell like burnt vapor
Through the back rows the money and stacks grow
I got stack about as long as cats stack nose
This is facts my niggas is going jack mode for me
Wildin, kick back doors for me
Its funny how my little niggas do it outta spite
Im riding wiht the 2 and i can do em out the night
These niggas talking crazy ima do em out the night
And you knew the shit was trash i just threw it out tonight nigga
Fuck the chit chat tell me where the chicks at
Ill leave six shots in a nigga 6 pack
My chick strapped, rubber grip with the kick back
Yeah we hittin licks and niggas still ain't get their lick back
Im on fire yeah im nba (?) tongue
Im gettin rings like sonic on the hand glide
Damn im so damn fly
The swag kill a nigga so hard
I just seen his man die
Standby
I got bitches on the land line
And i can sell it by the pen or the gram and they scrammblin the lamb like i got the shit pan fried
So nasty and so classy
How you lookin like ryan leslie when diddy stole Cassie
Ain't no blowin past me
The rocks got so much nots the blocks thinkin that its goin badly
Ill come through and fly a man dead
Ill stick a nigga like spider-man webs
Ride a car door till you ride a mad dead
Cause i was only comin for your rider man heads
I done hit so many IG bitches
I can't even go on IG and slide IG pictures
My life is a movie on widescreen nigga
So one eye open like visine nigga
So i be at the dice game
I got precise aim
I said the same thing to em when his wife came
I got the white chain its lookin like the lights came and banged so hard off the rays that my ice changed
Im quite tame when these niggas try to hurt me
I'll burn you fuck niggas like a bitch that got herpes no mercy
A bad bitch will hop in my whip and chauffer me
Left class like a nigga home early
I'll tell you get the picture nigga
Cause ill put the shots on y'all like you payin' for the liquor nigga
Youll get smoked like a swisher nigga
I do em like the old days four ways how i split the nigga
From the B into the finch west
They know my name [?] in the city than the bench press
These niggas hustle, I ain't impressed
I sold bags of the white more tight than 50 Cent vest
From G Unit all I need is three units
Can't see me, but I'm the illest cat you seen do this
I be movin' with disciples
And you a pre-Judas
Bounty on his head yeah that's how you reuse it
Puttin' powder in the engine and guns in the fenders
Coke and the drugs by my tongue and my dentures
I couldn't make this up if I tried to
[?]
I slide my guys through, burning size five too
I leave 'em bloody leave 'em bangin' like he bangin' [?]
I'm slangin' on this corner, I'm slangin' mine too
I don't stress 'em I just let the gun bless him like he sayin' "achoo"
You don't really wanna square it up
Cause i'm focused
You won't notice like when Sway came back and his hair was cut
I'm going fast no matter whatever gear I clutch
These niggas crazy [?]
I'm going prime time, I'm on my slime time
I'm going hard these niggas know I'm on my grind time
See I want Bow Wow baby mama
I keep it real, she look good, I located drama
Yo listen ma, you made a rhymer and a state to state shiner
Money tall, shit I ball like the wall of great China
I love money, if you love money touch it
More karats in my jewelry than Bugs Bunny's stomach
Whats Poppin
