[Intro]
Woah, woah
One more time, one time, one time
Woah, woah
One more time, one time, one time
Yeah, for real look, look

[Verse 1]
You gotta know I want you
I'm tryna be better than
Nigga making calls, this gun tucked in my Letterman
Jacket, I pack it up on this motherfucking avenue
You know what I had to do
Was selling a pack or two
The money was all there, wasn't a fortune
Tenants talking eviction, she stepping all on our doorstep
So I hit the corner, hustling out for Jordans
You up on my trap phone talking these abortions
Baby you know that all of this shit is for you
Baby I hit that corner up for us
Though I be bummy and scummy
Through wires and fire you know I be on it for us
Shawty when I'm in that there
I'ma win that there
I wear a king's struggle till I'm sitting in that chair, yeah
So just promise that you'll never forget me
And when you see me you better accept me
Remember the crew on the glo up
Everything on the show up
Selling till the door up tryna get all the dough up
I can take you Caribana, we can fuck a float up
Came a long way from tryna hustle a four up
Picture you sitting up in that kitchen
You cooking doing the dishes
I'm in the room weighing dope up
Shit's changed, I done came from the pain
So when you see me promise that you'll do the same shawty

[Hook]
And when the things change you'll still be the same
And when things change you'll still call my name
As a nigga shawty I'm just tryin, tryna change
You know things change, things change yeah

[Verse 2]
And I'm just tryna be better
With this nine in my sweater
I hit the avenue and grind for the cheddar
For that bread, for that beef, that lettuce I'm working
Even when it ain't worth it I bring you that burger
Gotta know that we be flipping dope
The coppers is on corners watching so we getting ghost
But it's you on top of my mind when I'm in the corner hustling
With all of my niggas you gotta know I got to hit the folks
But look you knew the vision, I got a hustle the dream
My niggas hustle and scheme
It's tryna hustle something
And that's as it seems all of us from the bottom
So when we got it, got it, know it's us over everything nigga
Old time nigga, old time nigga
Shawty fuck me like I'm your long time nigga
Make 'em all forget you, they got Alzheimer's nigga
And they say they want you, it's a long line nigga
If they don't see you then they all blind niggas
I mean it's either that or I'm a sharp eyed nigga
Cause I see you and I think baby we a duo
Selling shadow get our pockets fatter than a sumo
NWO, that's the way we team up
You deserve an award then get your body link up
You ain't scared to check me on corners where I be on it
And you know it's where the bodmon ah I link up
Man have di tings up but it ain't about that
It's about you and nothing else cause I'm 'bout that
You ain't just pop out the sky I had to scout that
Just a few reasons why you should never doubt that

[Outro]
Fargo, and it's no one better
Used to show up at your house in that shogun leather
Used to push a Honda Accord in the '01 weather
Now me and you in that Wraith feel so much better, don't it?
We came up together
It's only right we Rolls Royce the lane up together
It's only right we VVS the chain cuts together
And promise me you gon' give me that same love forever
I swear I ain't tryna play musical chairs
I ain't here judging, I'm tryna come through in the clear
Fuck you, put two in the air
Fingers all through in your hair, tell me you love it
End of the day I'm just a TO nigga
I'm just tryna do better for ya
Tryna be the best so there ain't nothing better for ya
Know how I feel, Fargo
