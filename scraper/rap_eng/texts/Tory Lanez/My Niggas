[Intro: Meek Mill]
I pray to God man that we ball for a hundred summers
You know me, I did it for my niggas man
And I want everything my niggas want
You feel me?

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I want everything my niggas want
Except for the hoes they fucking
But if they happen to fuck my hoes
Then I fuck their hoes and it's nothing
Cause we all living life and we stuntin'
My niggas was there when they wasn't
And these bitches be there when you buzzing
And now that we here all these bitches be fucking
And all of a sudden these niggas be hating
They told me I never would make it
My niggas was down when these niggas was faking
Now we run the town and they mad that we made it
But we wasn't mad when these niggas was on
Fuck y'all thought we was doing
When I was putting in all that time
Grind hard nigga you gon' shine
Like a diamond in the sky
And these words I can't describe
How I miss my niggas that died
I'll war with the reaper to see them two times
My brother's my keeper, it's never two sides
It's DC or nothing nigga
And all these haters screaming fuck us
Cause they hoes fucking with us

[Hook: August Alsina]
I gon' ride with my niggas
Even if a nigga ball or fall
I know I'mma be alright with my niggas
If we keep grinding, tell 'em where to buy me or find me
Everything my niggas want
I want everything, I want everything
I want everything my niggas want, everything
I want everything, I want everything
And I want everything my niggas want, everything
I want everything, I want everything
I want everything my niggas want
Everything my niggas want, I want everything

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I want everything my niggas want
Buy a foreign, give my nigga one
Hundred thou, give my sister some
Bought momma crib, get her a bigger one
This year for my day ones
That stayed down when we ain't get to run
Flying jet and fucking hoes
Everybody can't get to come
Everybody can't be the boss
Keep your head up, you gon' see the stars
Put your head down, you gon' see the ground
On the tour, they got to see me now
All this food, they got to eat it now
What all you haters forgot?
What you forgot that I paid all my dues?
I was like twenty, I purchased a watch
Back when I prayed to God to get a brick, nigga
Prayed to God to be a rich nigga
Prayed to God to get the brand new Rollie
All flooded on my wrist, nigga
Timing is everything
I love all my niggas and my family is loyal
I'm buying them everything
Put Papi through college and everything

[Hook: August Alsina]
I gon' ride with my niggas
Even if a nigga ball or fall
I know I'mma be alright with my niggas
If we keep grinding, tell 'em where to buy me or find me
Everything my niggas want
I want everything, I want everything
I want everything my niggas want, everything
I want everything, I want everything
And I want everything my nigga want, everything
I want everything, I want everything
I want everything my nigga want
Everything my niggas want, I want everything

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
All of my niggas is all of my niggas
I swear we won't fall out for money or hoes
All of my niggas is all of my niggas
We busting them down if they come by the load
Down by the code
Get it, you flip it, you bag it, you add it, divide it, subtract it
You niggas is spending your cop money profit
The fuck is you doing? Hustling backwards

[Outro: Meek Mill]
How you gon' get money like that? I just talked to my nigga on the phone
He said, "Meek Milly, you did for the team again"
We gon' ball for a hundred motherfuckin' summers
One time for the Chasers
