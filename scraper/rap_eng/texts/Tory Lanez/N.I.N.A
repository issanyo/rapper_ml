[Chorus]
Shawty, I been at it all day
On this corner with this motherfuckin' plot and this nina on my side
Lil mama is a rider
I need her by my side like the .40 and the nina on my side
And mama used to tell me
"Don't you go outside, outside where the young niggas die"
I need a lil mama, I need a lil mama
Like a nina on my motherfuckin' side
Said I need a lil mama, said I need a lil mama
Like a nigga need a nina on his side
Nigga need lil mama, yeah, I need lil mama
Like a nigga got nina on his side
Said I need a lil mama, said I need a lil mama
Like a nigga need a nina on his side
Nigga need lil mama, yeah, I need lil mama
Like a nigga got nina on his side

[Bridge]
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever

[Verse]
Got this nina on my side by the way
Nigga, I ride by the way
Niggas is talkin', I'm slidin' by the way
That's why I keep my lil mama by the waist
Shawty gotta ride by the way
But I ain't goin' outside by the way
A lot of niggas move grime a lot of ways
But TO niggas, we don't watch no fakes
And my nigga's on the way
He just came home the other day
Shout out my dawgs that bust out the case
And all my niggas that they got locked away
Itâ€™s goin' fast by the way
Nigga, we don't even trap by the way
I stopped carin' if I pass by the way
I seen a 100 thousand cash in a day, nigga

[Bridge]
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever
That's forever yo, that's forever yo, that's forever

[Chorus]
Shawty, I been at it all day
On this corner with this motherfuckin' plot and this nina on my side
Lil mama is a rider
I need her by my side like the .40 and the nina on my side
And mama used to tell me
"Don't you go outside, outside where the young niggas die"
I need a lil mama, I need a lil mama
Like a nina on my motherfuckin' side
Said I need a lil mama, said I need a lil mama
Like a nigga need a nina on his side
Nigga need lil mama, yeah, I need lil mama
Like a nigga got nina on his side
Said I need a lil mama, said I need a lil mama
Like a nigga need a nina on his side
Nigga need lil mama, yeah, I need lil mama
Like a nigga got nina on his side
