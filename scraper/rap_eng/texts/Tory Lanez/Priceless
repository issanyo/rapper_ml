[Intro]
This One Umbrella mob is nothin' to fuck with

[Verse 1]
Ay bitch, I'm back in here to show you I'm the nigga
All in the VIP, them bitches know you as the nigga
From the corner sellin' dope and buyin' Swishers
Every night I pray to God for my intentions
Lord, lights and cameras
I came so hard, I pay the price for cameras
I flew my new ones for a night Atlantis
And told my oldest bitch her flight was cancelled, one night examples

[Interlude]
Fuck this nigga. If I ever see him again, I'ma seduce him. And right when he leasts expects it, take his wallet and dip

[Verse 2]
Mr. Feelings you can go and call the police
Ridin' dirty in the car with no lease
Skinny nigga but my pockets obese
Same nigga used to rob Sobey's
And lately I need me a bill again
I need to get back to the old and original, I need to get real again
Back in Toronto where niggas will kill you for who you be chillin' with
And work from the shootas, the shorty you screwin'
You not really with the shits, we don't really feel this shit
When Grandma kicked me out the crib, I was only a baby
Said fuck it, I hustled a went and bought me a Mercedes
I whipped it, I whipped it when I would see her in the hallway
And when she didn't see me, I parked that bitch right in the driveway, it's priceless

[Verse 3]
I used to take the 401 to TO
Honda Civic rollin' dimes and scopin' PO
Taxin' season, tryna find a link on T4s
To talk to Argie, you gon' need a check with 3 O's
Life commitments, I need a shawty every night to witness
Jamaican models bring ya ice and Guinness
And workin' pussy, that's my type of fitness
I'm countin' money like I'm Donald Trump

[Verse 4]
Let them niggas know them yappas on the reload
Got the ground where you stand, worth a kilo
Smokin' Swishers, motion pictures, Tarantino
Ballin' hard, it's Argie Fargo, fuckin' veno
Hey fucka we comin' for all of them
I'm all in apartment
Don't pay for no oregano
I'm smokin' on flush
He's dope on my clutch
I got my scope on the punch
I be so fresh and so clean
Bitch, you see soap in my toilets
My teacher Miss Thomas told me I would never be nothin'
I looked her ass dead in the face and said I'm gon' be somethin'
She told me that in a few years I'd be catchin' a bustin'
Now I'm catchin' the car service, guess who the driver? Her husband, it's priceless
