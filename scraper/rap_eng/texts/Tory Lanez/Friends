[Intro]
I'm talkin' money, I'm talkin'
She if ever found me, know she got a down nigga

[Verse 1]
I told her love me, or love me
I'm gone pitchin' this drink and I'm on bitches
I'ma need more than just a hook and a song bitches
To get mami off and let me hit all of her on switches
Fuck it I'm gone 'cause really we ain't got to much in common
So fuck it and bein' on is enough to say that we want it
I want a lover, really I want to love her
Sincerely she want to love me but fear that I'm on another
Niggas that want to fuck with her, tell her I fucking'duck her
But I tell her baby I'm on the road, with 20k for a show, so
Don't get mad if I tell you that I'm gone
We can fuck, be friends and live on, Swavey

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I hit you up in the summertime
Know you down to ride, I ain't got the time
I ain't tryna waste your time, baby
I got somethin' on my mind, baby

[Chorus]
We can fuck and be friends
We can fuck and be friends

[Verse 2]
She love me and gettin' money with a nigga
And even though we fuckin', she ain't fuckin' with a nigga
'Cause when I get up in it, it ain't nothin' to a nigga
She know the money galore, been fuckin' honeys on tour
She fuck with a boy, I love her like cooked meals
And them heels swollen, she rollin' like good wheels
I be that nigga stroking away that is your feelin'
I call it man slaughter the way that them looks kill, girl
I'm only fuckin' if it's worth it
But if it's worth me, I'm only fuckin' if she perfect
A real nigga really know what's up and yeah, my wrist chilly
Got these chicks in the celly, ho, whats up?

[Pre-Chorus]
And if I hit you up in the summertime
Know you down to ride, I ain't got the time
I ain't tryna waste your time, baby
I got somethin' on my mind, baby

[Chorus]
We can fuck and be friends
We can fuck and be friends
We can fuck and be friends
We can fuck and be friends
