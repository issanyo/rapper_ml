[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Alright, cool
Got it on smash
(Yeah) Yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Talk to me, baby (Talk)
Work it, take the shift off for me, baby (Alright)
I drive the whip you bought for me, baby (Brr)
You know I got a lotta opps on me, baby
I whip around the corner in the whip (Whip)
Shout out Rafaello, man I love the drip, drip (Drip, drip)
80 pointers on my wrist (Ooh)
I'm hella rich and I love to talk shit, so

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh

[Post-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Let her go, go, go, go (Yeah)
Go, go, go, go (What?)
Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go
Tell the crew, I got money, I'm the one you wanna know

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can make that pussy talk back (What?)
I can spoil you wit' these big racks (Racks)
She got good head (Head) and she eat her cornbread (Cornbread)
The Wraith red, Ben Frank, my friends dead (Yeah)
I don't wanna miss it, all of the money, I don't wanna kiss you
The pussy official, I fuck her one time and her face in a pillow
It's a one night ting, my diamonds fighting
This not no Breitling, that pussy biting
I tell her to talk to me (Talk to me)
The plug gon' walk with me (Plug)
Ooh, she bougie, she busy (Busy)
Fuck it, might buy her a Bentley (Bentley, fuck it)
Go (Go), go to the floor and pick up (And pick up)
She callin' my phone, might pick up (Brr)
She too bad, I might miss her (Rich)

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor
I want you to talk to me, baby (Talk)
You's a prissy little missy, baby
I got one night for you, baby (Yeah)
And so hop out the clothes, let 'em drop to the floor, oh

[Post-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Let her go, go, go, go (Yeah)
Go, go, go, go
Girl, I'll race you to the floor, tell her go
Tell the crew, I got money, I'm the one you wanna know
