[Verse 1]
I remember I was 9 when my brother used to rhyme
Used to see him spit, switch flows, and hold nines
Seen the same bro catch case and hold time
All that made me wanna do is continue his prime
As a youngin' all I wanted was to be that nigga
All they did was look at you and be like, "He that nigga"
Older brother, older son of mother
One I would look up to in the source
Hopin' that one day you'd be the one that I turn into
I figured it was just a figment of imagination
The magic made this moment happen
Look at me growin'
Just that after all these years, they had you waitin'
In that cell while niggas givin' you hell, I knew you was still basic
And when them cells close and spite cover your eyes
I just pray God let light cover your skies
Hope your inner stressin' don't mess with you inside
Keep holdin' your head high with some blessings in the sky, my nigga

[Hook]
Things don't always go, always go your way
I know, everything that shine ain't gold
And we might think we're close
But even we can be far away
I know, everything that shine ain't gold
Everything that shine ain't gold
It ain't gold, it ain't gold
Everything that shine ain't gold
Things don't always go, always go your way
I know, everything that shine ain't gold
And we might think we're close
But even we can be far away
I know, everything that shine ain't gold
Everything that shine ain't gold
It ain't gold, it ain't gold
Everything that shine ain't gold
