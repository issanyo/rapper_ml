[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Listen what you told me, listen what you told me
Look at how I'm on it, look at how I'm on it
I am not a DJ, this is not a replay
Soon gon' let me plug in, hit this little preset

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Music to my ear (Yeah, right)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Right)
Music to my ears (Yeah, right)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Right)
Music to my ears (Right)
Eh-yeah, yeah, yeah (Right)
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss
And it all goes through our ears

[Post-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Music to my ears (Woo)
It's music to my ears, baby (Woo)
It's music to my ears, baby (Woo)
It's music to my ears, baby
Woah, yeah

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Listen when I play this, this is not a playlist
We've been on the same shit, I ain't tryin' to change shit
Got girls that be tryin' to get famous, but they remain nameless
Saw you got me on a wait list, damn right, I'm awaitin' this

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Music to my ears
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo) (Right)
Music to my ears
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo) (Right)
Music to my ears
Eh-yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo) (Right)
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss
And it all goes through our ears
Music to my ears (Yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo) (Right)
Music to my ears
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo) (Right)
Music to my ears (Yeah)
Eh-yeah, yeah, yeah (Woo) (Right)
When we love, when we touch, when we kiss
And it all goes through our ears

[Post-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Music to my ears (Woo)
It's music to my ears, baby (Woo)
It's music to my ears, baby (Woo)
It's music to my ears, baby
Woah, yeah

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
Music (To my ears)

Yeah, yeah
(To my ears) Yeah, yeah (When we touch, when we kiss, and it all)
