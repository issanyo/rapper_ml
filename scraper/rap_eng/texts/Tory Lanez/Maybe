Maybe we could, flex
Maybe I'll finesse
Maybe I can do the things that you gon like the best
Maybe I'm the one that you gon fall in love with next
Maybe we can do the damn thing

[Verse 1: Rajan]

Make a text baby
I know you're wrong for me
But give it all to me
You miss your ex baby
Give it a rest, baby
I know you're wrong for me
But give it all to me

[Pre-Chorus: Rajan]
Shorty you're my
Imma love you down, down, down
Imma take you round, round, round, with me
Imma love you down, down, down
Cuz you don't know the things you do to me

[Chorus: Rajan]
Flex

Maybe I can do the things that you gon like best
Maybe I'm the one that you gon fall in love with next
Maybe we can do the damn thing
