[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Shawty what's your name
I just wanna holla
I ain't got no game
I'm just being honest
We should be a thing
You make me a promise
Cause you could be the one
My shawty girl, my shawty girl
You could be the one, I'll show the world
My shawty girl, my shawty girl
Baby you could be the one
My shawty girl

[Verse 1: Legacy]
Bad little girl say she from Florida
Mama stole my heart and I think I'm a need a coroner
You can be my wife throwin' hundreds at the night
I got money you got money, baby we can spend the night
What yo say? Shawty what you doing?
You be lookin' with everything that you in
Sunset swimming, whip gang cruising
Ain't nobody better, ain't no other that can do it like you
So mama just stay here tonight
She so fly I probably want to get married twice
So I won't hesitate to show the world
My one and only, pretty shawty girl
Super fly mama pour glasses of the nuvo
Bunch of girls around, but only feelin' you though
Shawty so fly, [?] Pluto
Hello 'till I hit and then it's psedo you know


[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Shawty what's your name
I just wanna holla
I ain't got no game
I'm just being honest
We should be a thing
You make me a promise
Cause you could be the one
My shawty girl, my shawty girl
You could be the one, I'll show the world
My shawty girl, my shawty girl
Baby you could be the one
My shawty girl


[Verse 2: Legacy]
She can make a top turn, she can make you holla
She ain't into kissing, sometimes we just kick like some converse
Mr... she gave me a new name
She said call her imposter, cause I'm not what you think
She said she not a one night fuck
I woulda pick her up quick shit just my luck
She say "why you tyrne jump the gun nigga"
Do like james mom and go build a bond get it
See I don't really like to work for play
But when she smile I knew she was worth the wait
Her design was some new type of perfect shape
And her were so blue that's where the birds would play
Hey she got me feelin right like a?
Ain; t with the breakin' up so fuck the sand man
I really want you girl (want you girl, want you girl)
Down to earth like a midget that's whay I call you shawty girl


[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Shawty what's your name
I just wanna holla
I ain't got no game
I'm just being honest
We should be a thing
You make me a promise
Cause you could be the one
My shawty girl, my shawty girl
You could be the one, I'll show the world
My shawty girl, my shawty girl
Baby you could be the one
My shawty girl
