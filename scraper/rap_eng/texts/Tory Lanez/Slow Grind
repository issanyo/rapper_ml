[Hook: Tory Lanez]
(Baby) Good love 'til your body gets weak
(Baby) Good love 'til your body gets weak
(Grind on me) 'Til your body gets weak
(Grind on me) 'Til your body gets
(Baby) 'Til your body gets weak
Good love 'til yo', good love 'til yo'
'Til your body gets weak
'Til your body gets (Baby)

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Ooh, got the feelin' that you know (Grind on)
The way I'm 'bout to get deep (Grind on)
The way I dive in that sea
And I won't hold back from you, baby
From the slow to the fast on you, baby
And ain't nobody lacking, no, baby

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
Good love 'til yo', good love 'til yo'
Good love 'til your body gets weak
'Til your body gets weak
'Til your body gets weak

[Verse 2: Jacquees]
(Baby) Grind on me
Relax your mind, take your time on me
Girl, spread your legs, dutty whine on me
I got you wet, now you slidin' on me, on me
I'm thinking 'bout you in the condo
Baby, I pull up on you solo
Not with the gang, girl, I swear I'm rollin' dolo
I ease the pain off your body, girl you don't know
And I won't hold back from you, baby
And I won't go back on you, baby (Grind on me)
In and out got your tracks going crazy

[Hook: Tory Lanez]
'Til your body gets weak
Good love 'til yo', good love 'til yo'
'Til your body gets weak
'Til your body gets (Baby)

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
I'm tryna get freaky, baby
All on your body, yeah
And when we're freaking, baby
Foreplaying, anticipating
Girl, oh

[Hook: Pretty Ricki]
Baby, grind on me
Relax your mind take your time on me
Let me get deeper, shorty ride on me
Now come and sex me 'til your body gets weak
With slow grindin', baby

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
You on my mind, more than not
No, ah, baby
Kissing on the floor and I still got it for you
Panties on the floor and condoms in the drawer
Cashed apple stones when I gas in your rover
Pull up to my house, sit that ass on my sofa
She know I'm in love, she wanna get over
She wanna get more than anyone before her
Body so curvy, I can't ignore her
Gotta get in for this time 'cause
She don't wanna grind on me, baby
Back it up, time for me, baby
Oh love, time for me
Yeah time, shawty, oh time
You on my mind, more than not
No, ah, baby
