[Verse 1]
I don't know if you belong to someone else
I know that I want you to myself
They might say I ain't shit for this
Just know that I meant everything I said to you for sure
If in fact that you decide
Well I wanna take it all up off of your body, for sure
If in fact that you'll be mine
I wanna take it all up off of your body

[Hook]
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself

[Bridge]
If I'm wrong then let me be wrong, let me be wrong, baby
For thinkin' that you don't need someone
I can make you feel like your heart won't do
Like it's you first time goin' strong, I want you to be mine for sure

[Verse 2]
Now if you decide, you'll say you'll be mine
Sit that ass by my side, ohh
Shawty, don't deny, I ain't askin' for a reply
Just hard to say goodbye, oh baby

[Hook]
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself
Pretty miss Karrueche, I'm sippin' on this D'usse
I ain't throwin' no shade, I just want you to myself

[Bridge]
If I'm wrong then let me be wrong, let me be wrong, baby
For thinkin' that you don't need someone
I can make you feel like your heart won't do
Like it's you first time goin' strong, I want you to be mine for sure
Make you feel like your heart won't do
Like it's you first time goin' strong, I want you to be mine

[Verse 3]
At the top sippin', baby
If I'm wrong, let me know, I gotta know
At the top sippin', baby
Can we smoke one more time? I gotta know
At the top sippin', baby
Just to go back to that night, all I want

[Outro]
I know what to do with it, I'ma keep it true with it
I know, I know what to do with it
A man can only dream of it, so I'ma dream of you
I know what to do with it, I'm not being rude with it
This ain't for Teyana, this one here for you, ohh baby
Bring your ass to Toronto, all I wanna do is
Bring you to the condo
So we can smoke
And you can let your stresses go
How personal
