[Chorus]
She told me, that I can't get her
Got no chance with her, but my mans hit her
She told me, that she can't with me
Well, I can't with her, I got more bands than her
Hey, ayy, ayy, ayy
I got more bands than her, I can't dance with her
Marchin' band with me, I can't stand with you
I can't hang with you, we not gang, nigga

[Verse 1]
Ayy, bitch, I'm the man, nigga
I don't dance, nigga, diamonds dance, nigga (Oh)
Watch the way they doin' the dance, nigga
Yeah, watch the way they do the dance, nigga (Dance, dance)
Flip my hands with you
Flip a gram with you, and split no bands with you (Zoe)
And we ain't takin' no Instagram picture
Put stacks all in my hand, I'm takin' a big ol' band picture (Brrrrt)
Tatted from my neck and to my Loubs, bitch
I've been on the top, I got a bubble in the coupe, bitch
Alexander Wang and some flame, got the juice
But bitch I'm not 2Pac and no the fuck, this shit not Juice, bitch
Fuck is you, bitch?
I'm the truth, bitch, parachute, bitch
Pull up out the roof, bitch
You a dub, and I'm a W, bitch

[Chorus]
She told me, that I can't get her
Got no chance with her, but my mans hit her
She told me, that she can't with me
Well, I can't with her, I got more bands than her
Hey, ayy, ayy, ayy
I got more bands than her, I can't dance with her
Marchin' band with me, I can't stand with you
I can't hang with you, we not gang, nigga

[Verse 2]
We not, we not, we not gang, nigga, I do thangs, nigga
We not the same, nigga, I do my thang, nigga
Quarter milli' chain, nigga, I run the game, nigga
I entertain but I'm not here to entertain niggas (Oh my God)
Big bank, bitch, you brought the bag with ya
Got enough to call myself a bank, nigga
I was broke and she would call me, "Lame nigga"
I just fucked her, yeah, bitch, I'm the same nigga (Gotcha, bitch)
Mmm, standin' on the sofa, I'm the man, bitch
Yeah, I rep the gang, I got it tatted on my hand, bitch
Stone cold face in my watch, Tony Danza
Is you fuckin' me tonight, lil' bitch? I know the answer (*Cough*)
The watch yellow, bitch, this shit got cancer
And I be with shooters that can't do the Instagram
And she told me this shit was goin' down
'Cause she know by the word around town

[Chorus]
She told me, that I can't get her
Got no chance with her, but my mans hit her
She told me, that she can't with me
Well, I can't with her, I got more bands than her
Hey, ayy, ayy, ayy
I got more bands than her, I can't dance with her
Marchin' band with me, I can't stand with you
I can't hang with you, we not gang, nigga
