[Chorus: Freebandz Tray Tray]
We don't do no friends, we don't do no friends
I fuck her and her friends, fuck her and her friends
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
We don't do no friends, we don't do no friends
I fuck her and her friends, fuck her and her friends
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce

[Verse 1: Freebandz Tray Tray]
I fuck her and her friend, never solo dolo
Put that X off in the pussy, boy we super YOLO
She can tell I'm the man once she see these bands
Suckin' this dick with her friend, they don't use no hands
Know my name out here ringin' so I'm fuckin' fans
Ferragamo hold that cannon and it hold my pants
Balmain, Giuseppe steppin', ain't you done hit a blessin'
Asses for money problems, swallow, baby don't gargle
She gon' bust it open, she gon' bust it open, uh
Fuckin' her face, fuckin' her face, I'm keepin' her chokin', uh
She gon' bust it open, she gon' bust it open
Fuckin' her face, fuckin' her face, I'm gon' keep her chokin'

[Chorus: Freebandz Tray Tray]
We don't do no friends, we don't do no friends
I fuck her and her friends, fuck her and her friends
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
We don't do no friends, we don't do no friends
I fuck her and her friends, fuck her and her friends
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Drippin' drip, drippin' drip, four seasons
Havin' but you lost me
I sound so hard, baby shit exhausting
Shawty askin' what it cost me, this shit is costly, yeah
Cuban 'round me, I ain't speakin' Spanish
Shawty tryna sell that pussy but I need percentage
Uh, pimpin' to its finest, I'm at its finest, ayy
I was born broke but I'ma die rich, wait
Tray Tray tell her pop it for the mans
Tell her we ain't trickin', she can't pop it for no bands
Freebandz one umbrella, we are not with the pretend stuff
Shawty fuckin' friends unless I can fuck her friends, oh

[Chorus: Freebandz Tray Tray]
Yeah, we don't do no friends, we don't do no friends
I fuck her and her friends, fuck her and her friends
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
We don't do no friends, we don't do no friends
I fuck her and her friends, fuck her and her friends
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce

[Outro: Freebandz Tray Tray]
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
I'm drippin' in sauce, I'm drippin' in sauce
