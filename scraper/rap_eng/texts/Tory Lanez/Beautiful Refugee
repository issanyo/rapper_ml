[Verse 1]
She said she born up Tiny Island in Tapioca
I heard she got 10 from deported out in Mexico
They tried to send 'em home but she say, "Let me go"
They put the tracker in her purse so they know where she go
I told her run, run, run, run, run
This country no win ting for you, you, you and me
Beautiful refugee
And even when she stayin' with me in the tropical
She always checkin' off her phone and say she got to go
Would love to keep her here forever but I can't
And the harsh reality of what I think

[Chorus]
'Cause she's on the run, yeah yeah, she's on the run
She's on the run to America, oh
So tell me why they wan' take from me?
My beautiful refugee
She, she's so sweet
So why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
Why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
So why they wan' take her from me?

[Verse 2]
They always seem to know just where she go
Up in the Hamptons, had her dancin', tell her go
She know they follow her everywhere that she go out
Don't need to tell her 'bout the government, she know about
She say, "Why, why them chase me?
I just want to roam free
As a beautiful refugee"
She say she hate it when they catch her on a J
She on a mission, she say she will never fail
She told me every second counts, can't let a day go
She say they wanna deport her back to Tapioca

[Chorus]
She's on the run, yeah yeah, she's on the run
She's on the run to America, oh
So tell me why they wan' take from me?
My beautiful refugee
She, she's so sweet
So why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
Why they wan' take her from me?
My beautiful refugee
So why they wan' take her from me?
