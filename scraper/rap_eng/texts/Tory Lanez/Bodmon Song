[Verse 1]
Shawty, you know how I'm strokin' on it
When I pull up 4 in the mornin'
We can smoke, girl, if you want it
We can smoke, just roll up pon it
I do the things that you wan' do
All of the things that you want too
Do anything 'cause I want you
Do anything 'cause I want you
Oh, pull up in designer
Girl, that body's purer than water, smell like Dasani
Sippin' on Henny
'Bout to hit your bitch with that see you in the ma√±ana
Mi need a bad one by me
Mi need a bad one beside me
They see dem suck pussy boi, try me
Bodmon, you can't do ah man grimy

Case informer wan' come find mi
Smokin' on Bob Marley
Mi hit di stage and di gyal jump 'pon mi

[Chorus]
A bodmon song
A bodmon song mi ah sing, yeah
One bodmon song
One bodmon song mi ah sing, yeah

[Verse 2]
When I pull up in Armani
Bere Hennessy, we nah do no Gin & Tonic
Fuckin' bwoy dem nuh wan' find me
Fire fi dem, no we nuh chill with informa
No man ah make it from my ends
