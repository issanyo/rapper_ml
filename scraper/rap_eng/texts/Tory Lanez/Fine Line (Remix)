[Verse 1: Mabel]
We came in crawling this morning
Already getting ready to go
(Aah)
And now I got you calling for me
'Cause there's a plan and you wanna know
(Aah, oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Mabel]
I know how this thing goes (goes)
I know the beat to your love
I know how you like yours (yours)
(Aah, oh)
They say anything goes (goes)
But I have the beat to your love (your love)
Where are we gonna take it?

[Chorus: Mabel]
Now I'm dancing on a fine line
Somewhere between a minute and a lifetime
You do it to me, to me
I can't lie, I got a bit caught up tonight
But it's a fine line
You do it to me, to me
You do it to me, to me

[Verse 2: Mabel]
I got a warning for you
Don't play me at this, I never lose
I'm all in, all in so follow me with your every move
(Aah, ooh, aah)

[Pre-Chorus: Mabel]
I know how this thing goes (goes)
I know the beat to your love
I know how you like yours (yours)
(Aah, oh)
They say anything goes (goes)
But I have the beat to your love (your love)
Where are we gonna take it?

[Chorus: Mabel]
Now I'm dancing on a fine line
Somewhere between a minute and a lifetime
You do it to me, to me
I can't lie, I got a bit caught up tonight
But it's a fine line
You do it to me, to me
You do it to me, to me

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
Look, how many niggas you know that could come do it like me, baby?
Come do it like me, baby?
Good drank, good weed, baby
Good drank, good weed, baby
Who you know that can do it like I do?
You know that I got you, whenever you come round
It's always the same
Yeah, I might mess up and you keep your head up
But you know that some things ain't never gon' change
I been keeping tabs on you
I still drop me a bag on you
If you fly, I'ma brag on you
'Cause I still gotta keep me a bad one or two
Right beside me
Bad lil' girl, gotta keep by me
Came in the VIP, don't need ID, uh
Hennessy drunk, and I see 'bout three tryna be wifey right now

[Chorus: Mabel]
Now we're dancing on a fine line
Somewhere between a minute and a lifetime
You do it to me, to me
I can't lie, I got a bit caught up tonight
But it's a fine line
You do it to me, to me
You do it to me, to me

[Outro: Mabel]
But it's a fine line
