[Verse 1]
Can we get away? Somewhere far away
Out of all these blocks and corners
With my Henny in hand, ooh
When I’m with you babe, feels like, ooh
Like the stars changed colours now

[Chorus]
Can we go to a place but alone
With my Henny in hand? Ooh
Can we bump to the bass real slow?
With my Henny in hand, ooh
Stay safe in the streets

[Verse 2]
When you say my name, gray skies turn bright, baby
Just wanna take you somewhere far
With my Henny in hand, ooh
Looking at your face, ooh
Those beautiful eyes, make me wanna
With my Henny in hand, ooh

[Chorus]
Can we go to a place but alone
With my Henny in hand? Ooh
Can we bump to the bass real slow?
With my Henny in hand, ooh
Stay safe in the streets

[Verse 3]
Can, we go far to a place where the place where the bass and 808s play hard
Where the jakes stays far from us and the car dump chase lay far from the place where we laid safe
In the AK seats, straight peace, you ain’t gonna tell a nigga stay safe in the streets
Where we live kids layin' in peace and the sun down but for now let me lay you in sheets
