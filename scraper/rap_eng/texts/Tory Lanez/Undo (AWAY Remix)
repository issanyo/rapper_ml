[Intro: Jeremih]
Uh, uh, uh, undo me baby
Uh, uh, uh, undo me baby

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Got her off the moon and now she take control
Says she wanna party like we in the hills
Baby, I want you to fuck me like you never did
And licking the glass for me, licking the glass for me
Jump in the coupe, jump with the bands like bop
You say we doin' no talking, got enough bands to pay off the cops
I wanna give it to you, I wanna tickle that box
I'm on the PCH, switchin' lanes, get top with no top

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Undo that roof, undo that dress
Undo that coupe, I do the rest
Uh, uh, uh, undo me baby
Uh, uh, uh, undo me baby

[Instrumental Drop: AWAY]
Undo me baby
Undo me baby, yeah

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Undo me baby, undo me baby
Tonight, I don't want it, I don't usually baby
Come do me baby, it's too amazing
I'll keep it on her as just long as you won't say shit
She wanna fuck, I might just lick and tickle it and touch it and treat it like she was the blunt
I get in back of that body like I was never tryna be in the front
I know that it's never enough
When I'm puttin' the weed in the blunt and the three in the cup, and I'm over you, fuck

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
Undo me baby, yeah
Undo me baby
Undo me baby
Undo me baby (Undo me baby)
Undo me baby
Undo me baby

[Instrumental Drop: AWAY]
Undo me baby
Undo me baby, yeah

Undo me baby
Undo me baby (Undo me baby, yeah)
Undo me baby
