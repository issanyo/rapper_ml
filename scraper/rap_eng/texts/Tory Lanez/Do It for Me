[Intro]
Ciravo, you better engineer this right
Yeah, this the one, baby
I mean I ain't gon' tell nobody you do it for me though, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm gon' put your cam on
We gon' get the dance on
Let me work your body out
I know that it sound wrong
Shawty, put it down on
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me
Do it for me, if you do it for me
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me
Do it for me, if you do it for me
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me

[Verse 1]
I said she too bad, that girl, she got her own
Got the type of body prolly can't leave me alone
Think she from the A and she never seen the Chi
Money like a plane baby, Lanez will make you fly
Shawty, what your name? Tell me what your age is
Oh, I got that bank roll, I'm gon' make you famous
No, I ain't gon' do you wrong, it's Friday night, why you at home?
You vibin' to my music, won't tell no one if you do it for me

[Chorus]
I'm gon' put your cam on
We gon' get the dance on
Let me work your body out
I know that it sound wrong
Shawty, put it down on
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me
Do it for me, if you do it for me
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me
Do it for me, if you do it for me
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me

[Verse 2]
She bring it back, she doin' it
My chick is bad, it's ludicrous
Mad 'cause I'm that youngin' that your shawty wanna be with
I got preacher money baby, you better believe it
You be rockin' Js, Louis rockin' shades
Pocket full of money, you be gettin' paid
Shawty, what you sayin'? Girl, you look amazin'
You can look the baddest but I bet you ain't payin'
Canada, my girl she come from T Dot
She be rockin' bumpers but see hers don't come from Reebok
Louis on them bags, she be rockin' to the closet
See her in the T and then you tell me what's up
You jump in my car ride, we gon' take a long ride
You gon' say 'cause she can see, show me your broad side
Bunch of women, pile of money, gettin' to the club, girl wildin' for me
Wanna ace for the dot, stays for the dot, the whole T be watchin'

[Chorus]
I'm gon' put your cam on
We gon' get the dance on
Let me work your body out
I know that it sound wrong
Shawty, put it down on
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me
Do it for me, if you do it for me
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me
Do it for me, if you do it for me
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me

[Bridge]
Some pretty girls in the room tonight
And they all know who we are
Shawty, I know you got the drive
So hop into my Range god

[Chorus]
I'm gon' put your cam on
We gon' get the dance on
Let me work your body out
I know that it sound wrong
Shawty, put it down on
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me
Do it for me, if you do it for me
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me
Do it for me, if you do it for me
I promise I won't tell nobody if you do it for me

[Outro]
