[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
'Bout to keep this shit so G, you won't understand
She gon' know some shit 'bout me, you won't understand
I found out that you was creepin' in his Jeep, oh, girl
I read texts in your phone, I know you seeing him, girl
So I did what I did for the night
Had to go, had to get, a couple chicks, get it right
I was wrong
But my flaws and my dogs
Got involved, so I think that it's time
That I say what's on my mind

[Chorus]
I think we both cheated love
And I'm certain we both got it bad
(Everything in your past just wanna let it go, I've been there)
Cheated, then I (done it)
Fucked around and (done it)
One more time (after all that)
Cheated, then I (done it)
Did it once again
(You got it, you got it bad
Hang up, then you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't want to have fun 'cause all you think aboutYou got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad)

[Verse 2]
When you say that you love me but you really don't
All that shit that you been talking', you ain't really on
Said it's time that I find someone new
And I'm tryin', but I keep on findin' you
And when I get the time, she always split my mind
Sippin' on this drank, how did we slip with time?
'Cause my flaws and my dogs
Got involved, so I think that it's time
That I say what's on my mind

[Chorus]
I think we both cheated love
And I'm certain we both got it bad
(Everything in your past just wanna let it go, I've been there)
Cheated, then I (done it)
Fucked around and (done it)
One more time (after all that)
Cheated, then I (done it)
Did it once again
(You got it, you got it bad
Hang up, then you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't want to have fun 'cause all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad)

[Outro]
You got it bad
Yeah, yeah, yeah, woah
Oh
And I know you got it bad
And I know you got it bad
(You got it, you got it bad
Hang up, then you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't want to have fun 'cause all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
But you keep on thinking 'bout somebody else
You got it bad)
