Lyrics from snippet

[Chorus]
She gon' let me hit it, ass out, ayy
She gon' make me throw that cash out, ayy
I'ma make lil' shorty tap out, ayy
I'ma hit that shit at night and pass out, ayy
Too trill, baby, you real
Two bad bitches like Lou Will
Two mil' in cash, baby, new deal
And if I don't fuck tonight, baby, who will?
She gon' fuck me and my partner 'cause she shameless
She gon' fuck me and my partner when she nameless
Finna hit it from the back, like, what's my name is?
I'm finna hit it from the back like

[Verse]
Baby, you know I do stuff, my ice is all chillin'
You know that it don't stop, my ice on triller
Sipping on Hennessy and the night's gone real in
No picture where you pet your pen, you know I'm tryna feel ya
Tryna give it to ya like a nigga in a jail cell
I got some horny bitches, tell them corny bitches farewell
I got some bad bitches, and some naughty bitches, well
Well, he got some shorties with him
Bring an orgy with him everywhere he at

[Chorus]
She gon' let me hit it, ass out, aye
She gon' make me throw that cash out, aye
I'ma make lil' shorty tap out
I'ma hit that shit at night then pass out, aye
Too trill, baby, you real
Two bad bitches like Lou Will
Two mil' in cash, baby, new deal
And if I don't fuck tonight, baby, who will?
She gon' fuck me and my partner 'cause she shameless
She gon' fuck me and my partner when she nameless
Finna hit it from the back, like, what's my name is?
I'm finna hit it from the back like
Baby, you know I do...
