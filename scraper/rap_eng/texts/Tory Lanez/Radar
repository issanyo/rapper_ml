[Intro]
Spin king nigga they gon' go crazy for this
DJ Spin King Baby

[Verse 1]
Not just the things you do
You know the things I do
I know the way you move
Both us are guilty too
You know what I've been through
Keep that between us two
I need that for me, just you
I need that, so don't you move
One more
I've been, I've been waiting for you to find it
All of the time that I spent
Waiting for you to find it

[Hook]
I'm on Patron
You on my radar
Don't be shy, slow whine close to me
I'm on Patron
You on my radar
Don't be shy, slow whine close to me

[Bridge]
Cuz I think that you might just, think that you might just
I think that you might just, think that you might
I think that you might just, think that you might just
I think that you might just, might just do it

[Verse 2]
And I know the things we do
Won't stay between me and you, won't stay between me and you
And if it's true, I know the things you say you been through
I know the things you're saying, it's true
I know you got something but it's cool
I took you places you ain't been to
I took the weight that you ain't been through
Oh no, no, no, I'm slow-mo
She say she gonna get it on the floor, so
But it's time, this time, baby
And it's time, it's mine, baby

[Hook]
I'm on Patron
You on my radar
Don't be shy, slow whine close to me
I'm on Patron
You on my radar
Don't be shy, slow whine close to me

[Bridge]
Cuz I think that you might just, think that you might just
I think that you might just, think that you might
I think that you might just, think that you might just
I think that you might just, might just do it
