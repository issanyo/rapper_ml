[Chorus]
Roll up, drink it, I do that for me
Pour up, get lit, I do that for me
Thinkin' how you only did for you
Never thought 'bout me, nah

[Verse 1]
Clean up, look good, shit I did for you, I do that for me
I would try to do good by you, you would do bad for me
Wear my heart on a sleeve, would you do that for me?
You wouldn't do that for me, you wouldn't do that so when I

[Chorus]
Roll up, drink it, I do that for me
Pour up, get lit, I do that for me
Thinkin' how you only did for you
Never thought 'bout me, nah

[Verse 2]
Go out, turn up, I do that for me
Say less, spend money, I do that for me
You know all this shit I do for you, I did for me
With all this shit I do and you still ain't did shit for me
So when I

[Chorus]
Roll up, drink it, I do that for me
Pour up, get lit, I do that for me
Thinkin' how you only did for you
Never thought 'bout me, nah

[Bridge 1]
Never thought 'bout me
Only did for you
Now it's all 'bout me
Ain't got shit for you

[Chorus]
Roll up, drink it, I do that for me
Pour up, get lit, I do that for me
Thinkin' how you only did for you
Never thought 'bout me, nah
Roll up, drink it, I do that for me
Pour up, get lit, I do that for me
Thinkin' how you only did for you
Never thought 'bout me, never thought 'bout me
Roll up, drink it, I do that for me
Pour up, get lit, I do that for me
Thinkin' how you only did for you
Never thought 'bout me, never thought 'bout me

[Bridge 2]
I hate to say I feel this way about you
Situations, you can't stay up out 'em
I guess there's nothing left to say about it

[Chorus]
Roll up, drink it, I do that for me
Pour up, get lit, I do that for me
Thinkin' how you only did for you
Never thought 'bout me, never thought 'bout me
Roll up, drink it, I do that for me
Pour up, get lit, I do that for me
Thinkin' how you only did for you
Never thought 'bout me, never thought 'bout me
