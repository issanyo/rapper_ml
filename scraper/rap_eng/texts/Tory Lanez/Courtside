[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
It's Fly America, woke up today, feelin' like I can't be stopped
Now my team startin' to move, all these haters on my cock
All these niggas tryna plot, you think he's tough, I'm thinkin' not
Maybe you should look and learn, boy you should probably watch
Bars like body shots, these beats gettin' mollywhopped
All we got is chicken wings and ding-a-lings for naughty thots
Dance baby girl, let me see your dance
I'm a future superstar honey, this your only chance
I was watchin' from my views, feelin' somethin' is just strange
Now if you're readin' this it's too late 'cause nothin' was the same
So far gone from takin' care of all these niggas
Don't try to thank me later since I kicked you out the picture
It's more life to live, it's four nights at LIV
Miami with my family and we courtside and shit
This how it had to be, casually causin' casualties
Mad at me 'cause my faculty is takin' over so rapidly

[Interlude: Mark Battles]
These niggas really wanted to see me fail, that's too bad my nigga
Shoutout my brother Tory Lanez, 3s up

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Fuckin' with this bad little bitch that never had a father
All she do is call me daddy, he don't have to bother
I finessed her with the game, I don't have to call her
You finessed with the your bands, boy you had to sprawl her
Used to whip, lock and rock, dish it all up
All this jiggas in my kitchen, tryna get the potluck (Uh)
Tits out, still stuntin', bad hoes still fuckin'
Pulled in, top down, backed up, still frontin'
Ah man, just in, this little nigga still got it
Hit your hoe way back when she a little bitch, still thot it
Still 'bout it and you read 'bout it
Still got an Audemar, Rollie, Patek time I can still kill
Maybe its a couple seconds I can kill out it
I don't got no time for it, I ain't got no rhyme for it
I can do a whole hook on a beat, I don't even need a line for it
I don't even need a verse for it, I don't even need a verse for it
Come in singin' one time (ahhh), motherfucker, that's a hearse for it
Niggas wanna make boss moves but don't ever wanna work for it
I got hoes that'll work for it, I got hoes that'll twerk for it
I got hoes that'll fuck the whole 50 nights on a world tour for it
I got hoes want make moves, I got hoes that'll do things
Hit your face like Liu Kang, bitch I'm hot like blue flames
White and red with the blue veins, niggas talkin' ain't a new thing
I got bitches havin' mood swings, 'bout to buy them bitches mood rings
Ahh, see this is serious
