Lyrics transcribed from snippet

[Intro]
Analyzing now
Stand clear
Check the pulse
No shock adviced
Analyzing now, stand clear

[Verse]
Feels like forever I've been waiting
Waiting just to get you back, yeah yeah
Even though you stingy with yourself
Know that I put it all on the line
And all those fucking secrets, girl, ain't working for me
I know you got that clean but you get dirty for me
No pulse, start CPR
Never felt how I feel, I'll fuck you right I will
You fucking right I will
I'm making sure no one can ever fuck you like I will
I know your type forreal, I know you like the thrill
I owe you things I said I won't do but tonight I will
All this Hennessey and mo'easy get me right for real
No one said it was easy to feel like how you like the feel
But I'm your type for real, you know the hype is real
Through all my situation, you got these bitches hating
Yeah, and you just tell me secrets
Travelled through these obstacles to find my way in
It ain't no question, [?]
