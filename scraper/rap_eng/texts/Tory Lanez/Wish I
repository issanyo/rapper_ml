[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
One, two, three and four
I’m leaving you walking out that door
One, two, three and four
I don’t ever wanna fuck with you before
Wish I never met you, wish I never loved you
Wish I disrespect you, wish I never cuffed you
Sometimes I miss you, sometimes it’s fuck you
Sometimes I miss you, sometimes it’s fuck you

[Verse 1: Zoey Dollaz]
And you playing with me again
When I had the chance should have fucked on your friend
Don’t need to call my phone bitch don’t need to send no text
I was faithful to you, you was fucking with your ex
God damn, how you play a nigga for a joke
I was dumb, should have never let go of my hoes
Let go of Kiesha, Jamica and Tiffany
Kiesha is missing me, still wanna be with me
Man, you done fucked up a nigga plans
Got to cut off everybody when I could have been the man
Understand I got bitches on demand, I can’t count it on one hand and your sister been a fan

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
One, two, three and four
I’m leaving you walking out that door
One, two, three and four
I don’t ever wanna fuck with you before
Wish I never met you, wish I never loved you
Wish I disrespect you, wish I never cuffed you
Sometimes I miss you, sometimes it’s fuck you
Sometimes I miss you, sometimes it’s fuck you

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Yo Tory!
Ride the wave and the wave in the air
I’m lit, I’m drunk, I’m juiced up
On my way, on my way, yeah
Looking for somebody I could make use of
Three in four, smoking with me gotta be in [??]
You is too pretty just to be ignored
Get it in the ring and I be like Floyd
Mayweather in the ring you ain’t never seen the ting
Big money on my line, yeah I set it on my ring, ring
You make me wish I never had met you and at the same time hope I never forget you

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz & Tory Lanez]
One, two, three and four (yo Tory)
I’m leaving you walking out that door
One, two, three and four
I don’t ever wanna fuck with you before
Wish I never met you, wish I never loved you
Wish I disrespect you, wish I never cuffed you
Sometimes I miss you, sometimes it’s fuck you
Sometimes I miss you, sometimes it’s fuck you

[Verse 3: Zoey Dollaz]
I know, I know, I know what time you on
I should have never saved you like coupon
Fuck it, I’ma just go and get my groove on
I’ma bounce back right after, nigga move on
One, two, three and four
Got my heart broke tryna love a whore
But it’s cool though, your friend wanna kick it like judo
[?] mami call a nigga chulo
You done fucked up a nigga plans
Got to cut off everybody when I could have been the man
Understand I got bitches on demand, I can’t count it on one hand and your sister been a fan

[Chorus: Zoey Dollaz]
One, two, three and four
I’m leaving you walking out that door
One, two, three and four
I don’t ever wanna fuck with you before
Wish I never met you, wish I never loved you
Wish I disrespect you, wish I never cuffed you
Sometimes I miss you, sometimes it’s fuck you
Sometimes I miss you, sometimes it’s fuck you
Sometimes it’s fuck
Sometimes it’s fuck you
