[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Always want you to, prove it
Lil mama, you know how I show it
Always want you to, prove it
Lil mama, you know how I show it
Always want you to, prove it
Lil mama, you know how I show it
Always want you to, prove it
Lil mama, you know how I show it

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Tell me you're still poppin' on the low
You found you somebody and I know
Tell me you need time all for yourself
Tell me you're still poppin' on the low
'Cause late night, I still drop in on the low
He just took you shoppin', girl, I know
Don't let him buy his way up in it
You know that I can't let no nigga get one up on me, no no
And you know this shit
So how could you give him what you gave to me? No, no
'Cause what I did was whack but you don't get me back like that, girl, no

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I was all the way in it and my heart was way in it
And now it's hard to stay in it, the pride is all gone
Only reason we fuckin' is 'cause I know that you love him
And back then you let him get one up on me, girl
I know that he just doesn't cut it
Ain't nothin' gon' change you back to the girl I used to fuck with
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Tell me you're still poppin' on the low
Girl, you got someone that doesn't know
He can have your sex, I got your soul
Just don't give that to no one else, oh, no
Straight like this, tonight we fuck to my shit, call me up
Because the reason why them niggas just can't hit it right
They wasn't blessed with my dick, straight like that
You can say, ain't gotta lie, girl, no
'Cause when we fuckin', I'm in it
Goin' all the way in it, snappin' my feelings
It ain't my props, just offendin', I'm goin' off girl
For the nights that you fronted
Man, you told me you love him
But how could you love him?
You know when we fuckin', I'm deep in that sea

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I drop OZs in my blunt, 44 from down the way
It's that nigga, it's that nigga that you know from down the way
Shawty got somebody else but that someone isn't me
Now you want expensive taste, girl, that shit just isn't free
I stay lowed up, I stay rolled up in that thang on the low
Girl, you're different, you don't even act the same way no more
Girl, I know you're movin' on, I don't want you movin' on
Girl, how long have you been gone? What the fuck have you been on?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I was all the way in it and my heart was way in it
And now it's hard to stay in it, the pride is all gone
Only reason we fuckin' is 'cause I know that you love him
And back then you let him get one up on me, girl
I know that he just doesn't cut it
Ain't nothin' gon' change you back to the girl I used to fuck with
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine
Can't believe that you done let another nigga get what's mine

[Outro: Ed Sheeran]
Down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Fuck around and spend time on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
That's why I came back, top down
Even though you know that
You gon' have to do more than just say it
You gon' have to do less when you do it
Lil mama you know how I show it
Always want you to prove it
You gon' have to do more than just say it
You gon' have to do less when you do it
Lil mama you know how I show it
Always want you to prove it
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car whippin' out
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car, let you go
Gots to break it down for you
To let you know you know the things I'm down for
Ain't going act like you ain't 'bout
My door you know ainâ€™t open girl you know I'm down for
Take your time to find you out
Won't hesitate to take the time to waste no baby
Streamin' out, the foreign out to play
You know it's things it takes
Down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
Even though you know that, down on it, yeah
Fuck around and spend time on it, yeah
Love it when you spin 'round on it, yeah
That's why I came back, top
