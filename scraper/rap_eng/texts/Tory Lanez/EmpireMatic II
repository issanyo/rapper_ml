[Verse 1]
To the single girls lift your head up
Stop being so pessimistic
These dudes do want you, just sit and listen
Its kinda hard for me to pick and choose
These ho's is loyal, just not to you
They know enough to keep my secrets
Even when i'm in a bind and i'm caught creepin'
No lie, i'm done creepin'
Unless you got a friend who don't mind eating
Sick thoughts and wicked dreams
Warped values and freaky things
This the generation of laziness
We don't create no more, we only faking it
Fake thoughts and fake relationships
I admit I probably faked a bit
But not like ya, I ain't a sucker though
Cause a man's a man with or without your eyes closed
And I stopped caring for school, and i'm hating it
Around the time it was less learning and more obedience
And I hate being told what to do
Cause i'm my own boss, so tell me what's your excuse

[Bridge - Kirk Hill]
She said:
I told you if you need me
Ooo baby
Just call me or something
Tell me what's on your mind
Never had much shawty
Never had much I never had much so show me somethin
Never had much so show me something
Gotta teach me how to move out them back streets
And out of yo back seat
Oh you riding or something?
I want you riding on something

[Verse 2]
I get in trouble in public cause my tongue is tasteless
And my girl like head in the strangest places
My exes like, "Reggie was really my baby back in the day"
And he probably still love me"
Well let's not get carried away cause things'll get ugly
I want bank rolls
Expensive chains and no ho's
I know its strange, but im really cuffed
And I feel like at 25 I think ive had enough
Only 20, with about 25 bodies, look where my slick mouth leads to, your girl getting hommied
The first tape was for Elaizha with glimpses of Tiffany
I hope Elaizha is briefly listening
Cause i'm the man now and I know you know it
And you probably interested, you just afraid to show it
