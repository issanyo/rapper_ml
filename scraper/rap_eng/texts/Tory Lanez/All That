[Intro]
This is all that, this is all that
This is all that, this is all that

[Verse 1]
Guns in my girlfriend name
My windows is on 3%
You got that rider's ambition
I fuck around and go with you
I didn't fuck intermission
They way that you hold me down
There's somethin' about it
There's somethin' exotic, you got it, you did

[Pre-Chorus]
But we ain't gotta waste no time
Just relieve the stress that's on your mind
So tell me your secrets, shawty, I can keep 'em
These niggas can't fuck, they won't ever feel you like I do
Relax your mind while we smoke this sweet
I'ma take your body, shawty, all I gotta say is
You know you shouldn't do it, girl
You know you shouldn't do it, girl
I'm feelin' your vibe whenever you roll with me
Took so long, didn't know this shawty, all I gotta say is
You know you shouldn't do it, girl
You know you shouldn't do it, girl

[Chorus]
This is all that, this is all that
This is all that, this is all that

[Verse 2]
You always there when I need you
Well right now I need you
I'm callin' your number
Girl, give me the feature
Don't spit me some me thing
I had that shit open
Your body, I had it
She smokin', I call it but you teasin'

[Pre-Chorus]
But we ain't gotta waste no time
Just relieve the stress that's on your mind
So tell me your secrets, shawty, I can keep 'em
These niggas can't fuck, they won't ever feel you like I do
Relax your mind while we smoke this sweet
I'ma take your body, shawty, all I gotta say is
You know you shouldn't do it, girl
You know you shouldn't do it, girl
I'm feelin' your vibe whenever you roll with me
Took so long, didn't know this shawty, all I gotta say is
You know you shouldn't do it, girl
You know you shouldn't do it, girl

[Chorus]
This is all that, this is all that
This is all that, this is all that
