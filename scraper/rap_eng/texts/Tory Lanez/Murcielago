[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Yeah, okay, I'm blowin' money fast but no, they don't call me Rick
Fresh up out that Callie, Louis duffle full of sticks
I know what to look so white, mama named Vicky
I told her stop suckin', girl, you givin' me a hickie
Name's on the record, wonder on the beat
Get your stamped out like we're drummin' with the feet
I'm a D Wade nigga, swipe it, comin' with the Heat
Lamborghini bird, it be hummin' when it speak
Know I'm in the buildin' like my desk up in the office
Now my money longer, doin' neck up on an ostrich
I'm so f'in' gone that I've tested alcoholic
And yeah, I'm rappin' like I'm reppin' for my college

[Hook: Sean Kingston & Tory Lanez]
Messin' with the kid, no, yeah, I know a big hoe
Ride around town in my new Murcielago
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah
I get the money pronto, sittin' in the condo
Better cuff your girl 'fore I fly her to Toronto
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Boy, I'm back up in it like I'm flackin' with your main
High pay longer than the highway lane do
We be talkin' money, shawty, don't you like my ligo?
I ain't coughin' nothin', I just play 'em like a banjo
And your girl know I'm sippin' rum, rum
Give you tongue, tongue 'til I get it dumb, dumb
How I do it, I'm the new Sean Con
Money like a lawyer, got it in a lump some
Stuntin' in my Lambo, hotter than some combos
Don't you know the cash streak as far as the land go
Your girl moanin', Alanso
Tory Lanez's 'bout to take her far as it can though

[Hook: Sean Kingston & Tory Lanez]
Messin' with the kid, no, yeah, I know a big hoe
Ride around town in my new Murcielago
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah
I get the money pronto, sittin' in the condo
Better cuff your girl 'fore I fly her to Toronto
Canada, oh woah
Canada, oh woah
