[Verse 1]
Normal things against him, Jordans with the lacin'
Shawty's more gold than a new diamond ring
That are made and deserves you and neither should never hurt you
She you deserve better than a new finer thing
If it's nothin' to do, tell him pick up the phone and call up a new driver
If it's nothin' to do, tell him pick up the phone and call up a new driver
No more cryin' on the sofa 'cause shawty, I'm comin' over soon
To come and give you this good lovin' and security

[Chorus]
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night

[Verse 2]
Now she done talk that talk, even better, she walk that walk
And heaven's got me thinkin' you were made just for me
All the time you be shinin', you're not a dime, you're a diamond
Baby, you should be in movies, I would pay to see
Oh I, oh I, oh I, oh I
Ay, oh I, oh I

[Chorus]
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night

[Bridge]
Feel like I'm livin' in the dream, baby
Feel like I'm livin' in the dream, baby
Feel like I'm livin' in the dream, baby
Some people make rumours
And they can say what they like
But baby, I think you special
And I'm glad you're in my life
Every night before I sleep
Girl, I need it all the time
And I pray that one day
You will be
I been waitin' the moment since you came into my life
For a second, that said I don't need

[Chorus]
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night
Whenever you need me, girl, you my favourite
Let me take you higher, hop on a spaceship
And we'll get it on
We'll do it all over night

[Outro]
Let's call it love
Let's call it love
Let's call it love
Let's call it love
