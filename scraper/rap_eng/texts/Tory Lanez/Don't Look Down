[Intro]
This gon' be your favorite song

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Yeah what did they do to you? Who gave the flu to you?
I know you sick of the type of shit niggas do to you
Let down your guard and I, I see right through to you
Water your garden, I harvest the food for you
I pursue you, girl who did it? They can't do nothin' to you
All them niggas, say they love you, none of 'em never knew you
You the reason I be makin' them hits, I'm the go-to
I know that girl that you see in the mirror
I heard that she like niggas that's urban, not on the curb
And I could tell you was nervous, I could tell you was perfect
You ain't nothin' cause girl you everything
You haulin' ass to move on to better things
I know you used to niggas who do them petty things to you
I know your ex a singer, why he never sang to you?
He blew the flame out your heart
It's okay if you say you was afraid of the dark

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Cause girl I ain't ever gon' leave you
No I ain't never gon' mistreat you
They'll be so beneath you
It's gon' be hard for them to reach you
Cause we gon' be high up
So high up
So high
So high
So don't look down (Don't)
Don't look down (Baby don't)
Don't look down (Don't)
Don't look down (Baby don't you look down)
I'm here now (I'm here now)
Hold me tight
It's gon' be alright
I'ma hold you down

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
But I be smokin' up a rolling, got them bad bitches
I know I do my bitches all over the averages
I take a lot of bitches and you know I'm
I know I've, I know I've, I'm pourin' up
Shawty I've been hard to stop and I'm just mothafuckin' bold to you
You just came up to the party
And always, I'm feelin' your body
Slobbin' that body
Sippin' on, sippin' on Sprite, that's how I like to, how I like to
You know how I like to (ugh) oh yeah, lay me on somethin'
I know them hoes, they be on somethin'
I know them bitches, they be on somethin'
None of them niggas ain't real to you
Niggas ain't real
None of them niggas ain't real
I will never leave you

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Girl I ain't ever gon' leave you
No I ain't never gon' mistreat you
They'll be so beneath you
It's gon' be hard for them to reach you
Cause we gon' be high up
So high up
So high
So high
So don't look down (Don't)
Don't look down (Baby don't)
Don't look down (Don't)
Don't look down (Baby don't you look down)
I'm here now (I'm here now)
Hold me tight
It's gon' be alright
I'ma hold you down
