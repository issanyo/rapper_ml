[Hook]
See the trap, walk in, scales everywhere
Ah yeah niggas everywhere, ooh niggas everywhere
Walk into the trap scales everywhere
Walk into the trap scales everywhere
You see real niggas everywhere

Walk into the trap scales everywhere [x8]

[Verse 1]
Walk into the trap scales everywhere
If you gotta weigh a chicken boy there's hella there
Don't play around with dinero or you'll regret to share
You better where fellas scared out in the car while we are dead aware
You better get a pair
When I came in the game they would say take  the extra care
And since I made me a change  its been gettin fair
And the same with gang that I'm reppin here
Walk into the trap don't be lookin at nobody else
If you gotta problem you can solve it with the man himself he been keeping pistols locked and loaded tucked up in the belt, I ain't playin witcha

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Walk up in the the trap
Where's the chemicals react
Zipping up the pack for the feind who comin back
Me and Tory Lanez flipped a brick and we collabed with a hook to warm em up its while the verse is getting tracked
Sending bricks to the bay
Shipping shit to the A
Left the product in a teddy bear fuck what you say
Gon' be keepin us safe
In the biggest of ways
If you isn't with the shit
Then you can get it from Dave
This is what I do no question
And I don't I'll ever change
This is how I'm paying for a session
Mother fucker get it straight
And I'm ready for the paper
See you later
All that other shit is nonsense
No time for the haters
