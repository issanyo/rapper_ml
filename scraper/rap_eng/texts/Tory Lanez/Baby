[Intro: DJ E Feezy & Tory Lanez]
You know we had to do another one, right
Heavier the DJ E Feezy
It's gon' be your favourite song
You know we gotta keep it smooth and sexy for my ladies
Trust me, we got more on the way
Promise me, want make this song
Tory, talk to 'em

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Soon as we pulled up, she put purple in the cup
Rolled five in the joint, I was tryna say wassup
All my niggas in the VIP, we ain't even need ID
Feelin' like I'm B.I.G., yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
When there's liquor in my cup,  doe
I don't give a fuck, doe
When I leave the club, doe
Knocking at your front door
Don't know what it is doe
You know what it was doe
I'm still tryna fuck doe
I'm still tryna fuck so

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I'll be the one to
Hit you late at night and freak ya body, baby
I wanna freak ya body, baby
Ohh, and your friend too
She lookin' like somebody, baby
Wanna have a party, baby
Me, you and her can have a party babe

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
So I hit the plug up and my nigga for the zip
I'm already on the drank, I don't need to buy the sip
Altogether, it's like three of us, so I might have a threesome
And I'll just tell 'em keep fucking, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Tory Lanez]
When there's liquor in my cup,  doe
I don't give a fuck, doe
When I leave the club, doe
Knocking at your front door
Don't know what it is doe
You know what it was doe
I'm still tryna fuck doe
I'm still tryna fuck so

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I'll be the one to
Hit you late at night and freak ya body, baby
I wanna ya freaky body, baby
Ohh, and your friend too
She lookin' like somebody, baby
Wanna have a party, baby
Me, you and her can have a party babe
