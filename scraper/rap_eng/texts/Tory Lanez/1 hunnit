[Chorus]
I can't sleep on you, I apologize but I got my eyes on you
I got a shot and gotta lie on you
So call me up, and you know I'm coming
Long as you keep shit 1 hunnit
Keep shit 1 hunnit
She keep it 1 hunnit

[Verse 1]
I hit town on a late flight, I was sipping on some remix purple sprite
Top down pulled up to a red light, looked over seen shorty she was dead right
Told her pull over, I approached her, shorty what you doing tonight I wanna know ya
I ain't even tryna be fast but come over, you can be that thing by my side just like a holster
She said sure why not, give me your address ill meet you back at your spot
Its 2 o' clock I'm at the telly when I hear a knock, and what she's wearing's so transparent I can't help but gawk
Girl I ain't the one for stuntin, girl ill make you mine I wouldn't cheat for nothing
But 1st I gotta ask you something, before I make you mine could you keep it 1 hunnit

[Chorus]
I can't sleep on you, I apologize but I got my eyes on you
I got a shot and gotta lie on you
So call me up, and you know I'm coming
Long as you keep shit 1 hunnit
Keep shit 1 hunnit
She keep it 1 hunnit

[Verse 2]
We can both be lear hopping, looking fly as hell together in some red bottoms
Hit up TV Johnny and go grill shopping, might hit a few strippies and get to bill dropping
I ain't messing with your head you don't need a shrink, rolling up this swisher while were listing to chinx
Give you summer time rings and some winter minks, and we only do v8's and I don't mean drinks
So girl you tryna leave with me Sunday, cause you gone be wishing that you left with me one day
You can leave the boring days for the fun days up grading you to a Ferrari from a Hyundai
She said I love it, lets leave and not think nothing of it
I replied girl I wonder, she said boy I keep it 1 hunnit

[Chorus]
I can't sleep on you, I apologize but I got my eyes on you
I got a shot and gotta lie on you
So call me up, and you know I'm coming
Long as you keep shit 1 hunnit
Keep shit 1 hunnit
She keep it 1 hunnit
