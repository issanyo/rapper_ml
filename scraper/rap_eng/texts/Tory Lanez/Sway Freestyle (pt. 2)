[Verse 1]
Sorry not sorry the boy is back in the building
He feelin' himself he pouring Corgiac in the building
Excuse me for not applauding we all up in feeling
I just feel like most of these artists aren't appealing to me
Young T, Mister Olay Free, I'm in the sauce like bolognese
Niggas still bitching, the gun still singing and my gun still singing to them niggas like Do-Re-Mi
So lit I take a pic for a 4K fee
Tell a bitch that I'm the shit, piss, throw-up, pee
Threesomin' hoes got them yelling "Hold up T
-you gon get in my hair", I'm like "so what B?"
I go New York on em', I got a new talk for em'
Niggas want beef, trust me I got a new fork for em'
I'm flying a Brooklyn bitch, right outta Newark for em'
New Jersey I'm getting money motherfucker you heard me
When I heard the term 6, I wasn't used to the shit
I dropped The New Toronto, I wasn't new to this shit
I know I'm not wrong for making lucrative shit
But, niggas all offended by my views of the 6
When it came to boy, I said that he was a fan
Say the same thing, I said that he was a fan
Tried to do the same, returning the same stamp
But I just can't fall, wherever I fall nigga I land
You seen it, baller alert, main news nigga
Holding off west like I'm Ye's room nigga
These blogs talk about me like a trade room nigga
I feel like I got the keys to The Shade Room nigga
C'mon, shit done changed, the chicks done changed
Chest, the titties, the ass on my chicks done changed
Went from a 1.6 to a 6 something Range
Gotta understand the life from which one came
I was taught drop harder, be the kid and drop cars where the girls will give you brain and even catch the smart water
And I ain't even stressing y'all father, when I'm say that I'm y'all father I can get how that can make you all bothered
So much money they just okay me
Out the womb I told the doctor "nigga don't play me"
My hoes never say nothing they just okay me
I keep the K right between em' like OKC
Please, the young boy has got the remedy down
If you ain't with us, you a op and you an enemy now
Boss nigga calling shots like I'm Penny Liddell
I hit them bitches that you never see at 70 down
Look, 2Pac back, my two Glocks strapped, with two pop bitches fucking in the U-Haul track
I'm so jazzy nigga I could bring the crew long lack
I'm so jazzy nigga I could bring juke talk back
Wait, tell you what to do just like a surgeon
I go, fly in that pussy just like a carpet
Backwood, smoking excuse me for the cigar scent
Dark tint, roll up on niggas so I can avoid all the nonsense
Please, people know that I'm coming shit me
Competition know I'm coming shit free
And this shit is ironic that the outcome and look the album is this summer sixteen

[Verse 2]
All my young boys is shooting they with the shootouts
One Umbrella crew out, nigga what you gon' do bout
My dog Jae is trying to find him a new route
I'm tryna do me the same, my bitches do be insane
Got that Mulsuanne glidin', I'm riding it
Through the rain
Through the pain
We do change, niggas won't do a thing
And me, I do thangs nigga hotta than blue flame
And my wrist saying bitch come kick it like Liu Kang
Look, nigga I don't play no games
I'm a General
Lifetime ties I ain't fucking with the federal
White wine vibe, 5 bitches on my genitals
Pedal to the metal she don't put me on a pedestal
I hit her with the finishing touch
I diminish them bad bitches and hit em' like a cinnamon dutch
I touch bad bitches with mad riches, they dad riches
And I'm in they back so much nigga I'm Ad-Libin'
Big timer, doe proper, show stopper
Bad bitches, actresses in soap operas
Getting so much doe ya'll niggas owe papa
I get paid to put you on a stretcher, old doctor
We be moving militant, whole squad real and shit
10 rollies, 30 chains whole squad killin' it
Went to Rolls Royce, brought the Wraith out the dealership
Bought the bitch cash you can tell em' that I'm still legit
Y'all say y'all ball with payments to make
On the G4 cigar with plane flicks to take
G5 private plane away from jakes
And yeah nigga I do lear from state to state
Gotta yellow presidenti and I baked the face
My chick yellow den confetti, gotta laced in grape
Treat my dates like, "fuck it if we late, we late"
And if you fucking and you saying you relate we great
Okay, why them niggas hating on Tory, can't chance it
Why them niggas sick of my face, that's cancer
Why they in the backroom dissing like the dancers
Well me and Sway are the same cause we don't got the answers
I was with the scammers, trigger pullers and jammers
Night time shooters a do you in they pajamas
Then eat Oodles and Noodles and go to sleep vampin'
Toss hammers in water and lay in East Hampton
Me, Sosa, and Brooks that's the three champions
Give your bitch a 3 point foul, 3 chances
Ya broad say I'm lying, I ain't fuck it, she dancin'
I knew she was fucking from the first 3 glances
Heard she gotta twin that heard I ball, Steve Francis
Fuck her and then I'm taking her sis, Steve Nash shit
Relapse nigga, I'm on my relax nigga
And I already won the race these just re-laps nigga
Mind your bitch and you bees wax nigga
I keep 3 straps
Cause we done hit some cats that's gone be back nigga
After the reh reh talk, the "Wah gwaan Popcaan?"
I'm still with real niggas saying, "wah pop? wah gwaan?"
Pull in something foreign with the top all chopped on
Niggas getting mad but the boy on top don
Ralph Lauren bedsheets, Ralph Lauren I'm killing it
Linen all foreign, I'm touring with foreign models
Order more bottles them bitches is gon' swallow
And I got so many hallow tips, I swear I'm going hallow
When I shoot we bang my nigga it's gon' follow
When the aim full throttle and I drink the full bottle
Of Patron, when it's on my nigga then it's on
So we gon' get it on until we in the zone
And it's real man little fucker you niggas gon' feel em'
August 19th my niggas is gon' kill em'
We going pop, nigga we going pop
Pop up and make another mill I call that going pop nigga
Yeah nigga and y'all niggas gon' flop nigga
All my niggas, one umbrella we gon' drop niggas
Yeah, I'm getting so much
Niggas getting cheese my nigga, they acting so tough
I don't give a fuck my nigga, just grow up
I'm just getting money so much, I can throw up
Last time I came on Sway my chains was wack
This time I came on Sway my chains is stacked
I don't give a fuck my nigga
