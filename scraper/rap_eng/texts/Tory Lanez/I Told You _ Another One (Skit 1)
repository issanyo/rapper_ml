[Tory Lanez]
American raised
Canadian born
My name is Daystar Peterson
One day I’ma be the biggest artist in the whole world
As for right now though
The year is 2008, I’m 16 years old
This is where my story begins

[Tory's Aunt]
DAYSTAR! Daystar!
I know you hear me calling you!
DAYSTAR!
Open this door, you know what
I-I-I’m done, I’m done
I’m so sick of your disrespect
I-I-I Don’t know what the fuck to do
I-I-I-I’m tired
You don’t cook, you don’t clean, you don’t do shit
All i ask you to do was go get a job
You won’t even go get a job
But you wanna find yourself in the streets hustling
Thinking that shit is gonna pay off
It ain’t gonna pay off
It does not last
Your gonna find yourself dead
Really-oh okay
You mean to tell me
You think that street life is gonna pay off for you?
Boy please!
I’m just waiting to get the phone call for them to tell me
To come down and identify your body
It ain’t gon’ last
And this music stuff
NIGGA GO get a JOB!
That’s what you need
You need a JOB
I’m done
I’m sorry you lost your mom but i can’t take this shit no more
I want you to get your shit and get THE FUCK OUT
I’m done with your ass
Get your shit, get the FUCK OUT!
I’m done, GET THE FUCK OUT!
