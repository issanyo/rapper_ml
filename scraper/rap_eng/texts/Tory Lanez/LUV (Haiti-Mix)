Tell what you want/
What you really-really wanna do/
When the rudeboy Kwizzy gone come for you/
I got next year's winter and the summer too/
And when the tape drops/

(Everyone Falls)

I remember when a nigga tried to fuck with you/
You made it seem like I made you uncomfortable/
I got a buzz, now a bitch getting comfortable/
It's too late thot/

(Everyone Falls)

I thought you were the ba-ba-ba one/
Imagine me and you can can ba-ba-ba-fun/
Brain so good, make you da-da-da dumb/
Said they coming for son/
But they ain't coming for none/
Hold up a second I just had to get the flow back/
I only call her on a Thursday cuz she a throwback/
Controlla, control- Yeah I control that/
Test me like I'mma hold back/
You better slow that down/

(Yeah)

You better slow that down/
I'm always ready cuz I always keep my zoes at bound/
King of the city, but I never show my crown/
If you ain't know that then, you should know that now/
East0side Flatbush, forever repping Ayiti/
Back when I was geeky on the block with anxiety/
Asking for a BigMac, momma paid no mind to me/
And told me to be humble/
And "Go home, go eat your spaghetti,"/
Eye-ya-ya
Oh why oh why
Where'd you find this guy?/
Buzzing through the city in the night like a firefly/
I can see where enemies lie through my tiger eyes/
Niggas done tried to get me lined/
Least the kind of tried/
Yeah, I'm done replying to you guys
We ain't meant to be friends/
I'm done trying with you guys/
I done burned a couple bridges here fighting with you guys/
My niggas riding till they die/
You niggas dying for a ride/

(You Niggas!)

You niggas crying to be signed/
You treat music like a hoddy/
Shit is science to me guys/
I love all my day ones, and I'll be biased to these guys/
And they they lions to pride/
You niggas lying for your prides/

(You Niggas!)

Tell me what you want/
What you really-really wanna do/
When the rude boy Kwizzy gone come for you/
Nobody, Nobody gonna comfort you/
How dumb are you? I'm killing all of you/
I been in my tent for so many, many, many days/
I ain't got no friends any-anyways/
Still a nigga get sent for any day/
Wap kon George/

(Everyone Falls)
