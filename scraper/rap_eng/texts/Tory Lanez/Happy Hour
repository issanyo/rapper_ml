[Intro: Tory Lanez]
Know you messin' with a winner, baby
I mean we only with the best though
You know I never fail, right?
I mean but it's not about me

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
'Cause we can leave the season in a bliss
Say the best silence is me with a kiss
Well, I guess I got a meetin' with your lips
In case with your face and agree with your hips
They say love's just agreement with a twist
Me, I see love is the reason we exist
And baby, you the sweetest, see you click
And I would hate to see you leave for someone else who ain't this
Yeah, I know your ex man ain't shit
Try to get another but the next can't hit
It's daylight and we ain't even came yet
And I ain't gotta even know her name yet
I hit the spots that your ex can't get
Even though X marks it, I'll be in the star ship
Bringin' you the stars 'til you star sick
Then I turn it round like a boss spin, daily costin'

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Back to the crib
Thinkin' 'bout takin' you home after the club
Shawty, you turnin' me on in the club
One shot, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty
Two shots, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
Excuse me girl, I'm not tryin' to interrupt you from talkin'
But you're somethin' special that just caught my heart
I wonder why
But hey, how you doin' anyway?
Girl, you can have anythin'
Right after the club
'Cause your home girls came with they dresses on
And they hair all done from they hair salon
And they might as well get they drinkin' on
Here's your favourite song

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Back to the crib
Thinkin' 'bout takin' you home after the club
Shawty, you turnin' me on in the club
One shot, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty
Two shots, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty

[Verse 3: Kid Ink]
It's clear to see, I wanna take you home
Happy hour in the bed, bring a friend, 2 for 1
Let's have another drink, I can tell you a freak, tired of sex on the beach
The way you dance, I swear it looks like you havin' sex with the beat
Quarter past 1, still ain't tired, turnin' me on, no assembly required
Legs long, island ice tea, when you wanna leave?
Car's outside, valet got the keys, let's chill, feel the breeze
What you think? Is that somethin' we can sip to? Just wanna get you

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Back to the crib
Thinkin' 'bout takin' you home after the club
Shawty, you turnin' me on in the club
One shot, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty
Two shots, it's happy hour in the bed, shawty

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
Swavey, you know you bad though
It's cool 'cause I like it, it's happy hour
On again and on again
Woo, that boy that got that voice, boy
