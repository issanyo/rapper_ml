[Intro]
Think y'all niggas know what it is
We all the way live
Shout out to my bitches that do the postal, yeah

[Chorus]
I get Céline for my bitch that do the postal
I get that brick, I get that bird from coast to coastal
I hit the papi then them bitches screamin', "Ay"
I mix then pump my wrist and whip until it's dry
I threw that dope and all that dodi in the bushes
I heard the feds were lookin' for me, got to book it
I know you're sellin' but you need to cut the price
I get that pack and run that bitch like Jerry Rice

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I got that A1 perico
Connect and I call me a Hector
I got ones that want the wholesale
I got ones that want the sectors
I got love for all my niggas
That'll come around and break it down in sections
Funny all these niggas pussy
Only time I'm walkin', I don't need protection
I got a check on me right now
My ring lookin' like a lighthouse
All of them bitches you seen on their Instagram flexin'
Be fuckin' at my house
Trappin' all out of the B
Play Picasso on the beat
Niggas pissy just to get me out
They know it's 50 thousand for the feat, sheesh
Let me tell you somethin' 'bout this chick that I got
I'ma buy her new Céline if she keeps mixin' my pot
She stay all up in the kitchen in that trap, in the B
She don't twerk but with that work I swear that ass is a beast

[Chorus]
I get Céline for my bitch that do the postal
I get that brick, I get that bird from coast to coastal
I hit the papi then them bitches screamin', "Ay"
I mix then pump my wrist and whip until it's dry
I threw that dope and all that dodi in the bushes
I heard the feds were lookin' for me, got to book it
I know you're sellin' but you need to cut the price
I get that pack and run that bitch like Jerry Rice

[Verse 2]
Yeah, for the apologies
I made so much money this year
These niggas could never ever say they copied me
Ed Sheeran covers on my shit
These niggas could never ever say they're stoppin' me
Fuck the apology
I got some bad bitches rollin', you know that they gotta be
All of my money colored like Monopoly, yeah
Tell all them bitches
I'm rollin', I'm smokin', I'm sippin' on Hennessy, yeah
Beside them bitches that came up from Memphis
My chick only 10 I see, yeah
Energy, energy, I got that bitch off the Hennessy
All my diamonds white like they in supremacy
All my bitches 10s like that's just the Tennessee

[Hook]
I get Céline for my bitch that do the postal
I get that brick, I get that bird from coast to coastal
I hit the papi then them bitches screamin', "Ay"
I mix then pump my wrist and whip until it's dry
I threw that dope and all that dodi in the bushes
I heard the feds were lookin' for me, got to book it
I know you're sellin' but you need to cut the price
I get that pack and run that bitch like Jerry Rice
