[Intro]
Oh yes it is
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Awh baby

[Chorus]
Make my life complete
You are so sweet
No one competes
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love
With you I have no sight

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, need you to see my Mercedes
And I think that it's time
Can't deny that you're on my, on my mind
I know this shit ain't forever
But making love we go as long as we can
Long as we wake up in the morning
You are so sweet, no one compete baby
My only one, just like the morning sun
My whole life has changed

[Chorus]
My whole life has changed (my whole life has changed)
Since you came in, I knew back then
You were that special one
You were that special one for me baby
I'm so in love, so deep in love
And I never knew it would be
You make my life complete
You are so sweet, no one competes
No one can
Glad you came into my life
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love
With you I have no sight

[Verse 2]
I love you so that I can't let you go
Make sure you know that I be on my selfish
'Cause I see no one else in the party
And you're on your grown and sexy for me
Since you got me here
All that, shit I do, is for you
And I lay at night with my pistol
Tryna make it up to you

[Chorus]
You're very special baby
I knew back then
You were that special one
Special baby
I'm so in love, so deep in love
You make my life complete
You are so sweet
No one competes
Glad you came into my life
Glad you came into my life
You blind me with your love
With you I have no sight

[Outro]
The things you do
The things you say
But you still gon come my way
Yeah baby
