[Intro – Tory Lanez]
I’m guilty of, I’m guilty of it
A nigga guilty of it

[Hook – Tory Lanez]
Y’all know me, same old G, getting that paper
Ain’t nothing gone change except this money that I ball with
Ain’t nothing but same old day one niggas I came with
And we all in, get baby to say we balling
And we guilty of it
These hoes on me, ice froze on me, I’m guilty of it
That stash on me, that cash on me, I’m guilty of it
These hoes get too attached to me, they guilty of it
Shit I must admit I’m guilty of it

[Verse 1 – Chubby Jag]
Ok I’m guilty, guilty, guilty for shining on these bitches
Think I’m cheating, only guilty for grinding
Told these hoes that I love em, I’m only guilty for lying
They hate me because I did it, I’m only guilty for trying
Like yolo, I’m on my dolo, hate me then that’s a no-no
For sure though, I’m in a polo with your ho
We sipping coco in SoHo
I’m taking selfies with bitches cause they go loco for photos
Got the green for the smokers, I got the Georgia for sure though
I’m on my hustle, guess I’m guilty for bitching
I don’t talk, I don’t know nothing, I’m never guilty for snitching
I feel money coming so all my hinges guilty for itching
Need a wifey cause these bitches is always guilty for bitching

[Verse 2 – Chubby Jag]
These bitches guilty, feel me, these bitches guilty
They all up on this [?] these bitches feel me
I beat it and then I killed it, can’t say that these bitches killed me
Put my clothes on then I leave, I be doing these bitches filthy
I blow that, oh yeah you know that
I do it, don’t have to show that
Bought my coco, fuck the smile and the Kodak
Old school, no throwback
I’m killing, I spit for show crack
Just making showings for sure that
I’m making notes that I give all my niggas the shit I owe back
That’s real, I only smoke on that kill
One loyal nigga, that’s real
I’m giving bitches that feel, I’m outchea pitching that pill
And if you know me I’m killing unless you stop me
Flossing, oh yeah I’m bossing, guilty, I guess you got me
Chubby, gone
