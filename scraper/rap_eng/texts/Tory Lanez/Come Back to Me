[Intro]
She got someone that she sees late night, I know this
I'm just tryin' take that position from em'
We been talking on the low, I know one day you'll notice

[Verse 1]
I think I found her, she's so astoundin'
Everywhere she go, that music play, she looks so soundish
Niggas crowd around her, but that's ain't what she round for
Search around the world and I can't find what she surrounds me with
I know that she was made for me
I know that heaven must've saved you just for me
The way that I feel right now can't be coincidence
The way that you feel right now can mean you're innocent

[Pre-Chorus]
To all of the ones that have been in love with you
This is a fuck you to all you niggas
We had some good times, I've been in love with you
All of them good times, I wish them good times

[Chorus]
Can come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me

[Verse 2]
Smoking loud and on patron, I'm in my zone, I'm in it
Ain't no one can stop this feeling that we got, no oh
You make it feel the way you used to feel back when we did it
Oh listen baby, top down in the winter your city baby, hey
How many shots does it take just to get you all on it?
Girl, how many moves I gotta make? I start to talk all honest
Girl I want you, can't help it if you need me, don't leave me
I'd be fucked up, I'm waiting
I say

[Pre-Chorus]
To all of the ones that have been in love with you
This is a fuck you to all you niggas
We had some good times, I've been in love with you
All of them good times, I wish them good times

[Chorus]
Can come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
Come back to me
