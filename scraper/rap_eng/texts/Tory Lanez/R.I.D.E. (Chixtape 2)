[Verse 1]
You can be the homie for tonight, girl (Ride it)
I just wanna teach you how to ride (Ride it)
Now let me be your inspiration, oh darling (Ride it)
You gotta let me be your guide (Ride it)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if I can't be a better man
Loving you girl, then I'm through girl
'Cause if love can't bring us closer
Then I'm screwed girl, I'll be screwed

[Chorus]
Ain't begging you to ride
But for tonight, you should ride (Ride it)
Look, I ain't begging you to ride
But tonight, you should ride (Ride it)
And we gon' make this shit right

[Verse 2]
Loving your vibin' all night (Ride it)
Fussing and fighting, oh no, baby (Ride it)
Sexier than sexy, hope you riding, oh (Ride it)
Look sexy when you walk, I'll get inside it (Ride it)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if I can't be a better man
Loving you girl, then I'm through girl
'Cause if love can't bring us closer
Then I'm screwed girl, I'll be screwed

[Chorus]
Ain't begging you to ride
But for tonight, you should ride (Ride it)
Look, I ain't begging you to ride
But tonight, you should ride (Ride it)
And we gon' make this shit right
Look, I ain't begging you to ride
But tonight, you should ride (Ride it)
Look, I ain't begging you to ride
But tonight, you should ride (Ride it)
And we gon' make this shit right (Ride it, ride it)
