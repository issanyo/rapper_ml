[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
In here, toasted up

Single for the night and the night looking young
She throw it to me right, anytime you make it jump, jump
Throw it to me, throw it to me
Bust it like a new year, all of it to me

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Don't get in my way, get in my way now
Don't you go out your way on your way down
Don't gotta be partying, ain't tryna keep up
Just don't look for me, end of story
It's the major leagues, I swing my dick like batter up
I stay creeping
Hit it out the park
With your best friend and be fucking in my 'Rari
Know a nigga petty, I'm not saying sorry
I'm just countin' checks, tryna flex, you know

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Tryna duck my ex
Count a hundred checks (Oowee)
Tonight I'ma flex, ah (Oh yeah)
Rollie, no Patek (Oowee)
Give me the baguettes (Oowee)
And my .40 and the TEC, oh (Yeah, yeah)
Tryna duck my ex (Oowee)
Damn what's comin' next (Oowee)
I just wanna flex, oh yeah (Oh yeah)
Tryna duck my ex (Oh yeah)
Count a hundred checks
I just wanna flex, oh yeah

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Yeah
I go hard, erect
Surrounded in baguettes
My life need a set
A director and a soundtrack
Sippin' on some Malbec
Where you get that style from?
Let me get my style back
Never been camera shy
Mug shots, no Clayton High
Potato on the barrel, turn your ass into potato pie
Every letter in the alphabet a G (G)
My favorite rapper that I wanna see is me
You can't compete
I'm out your league
Check your receipt
The dick ain't free, yeah
Okay, on my fourth Patek
I'm stuntin' on my ex
Give her everything except another chance and respect, yeah

[Chorus: Tory Lanez & 2 Chainz]
Tryna duck my ex
Count a hundred checks (2 Chainz)
Tonight I'ma flex, ah
Rollie, no Patek
Give me the baguettes and my .40 and the TEC, oh
Tryna duck my ex
Damn whats comin' next
I just wanna flex, oh yeah
Tryna duck my ex
Count a hundred checks
I just wanna flex, oh yeah
