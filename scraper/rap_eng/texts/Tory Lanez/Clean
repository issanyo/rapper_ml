[Tory Lanez]
What the fuck you niggas think, think?
Bitch  I'm pulling up clean, clean
Pulling up clean

[Verse 1: Lil Rich]
Pulling up clean, need a iced out bust down wrist
Talking bout' Christian Dior, never seen pimpin' like this
Never seen bitches go crazy
Wait till I hop out the 6
I know, I know, this shit is real as it get
This is extravagant, heated leather that's the lavish shit
Serenaded by the baddest bitch, who once told me I ain't have the shit
I double park outside the venue like I'm juiced up on some carrot shit
See you when I wake up in the morning with some breakfast on  some silver platter shit

Ah yea, I know she stay down
All them other niggas catching fades now, yea
I'm that guy, I'm so live

Lord, Lord
I swear I need to be baptized
She need her ass in the fattest size
She need her toes and her nails painted
You gon' pull up with the flyest clique
Know that your friends gon' be well acquainted
Know you been working that overtime
Get that respect that you do need
Spend it on a nigga like me
One time I'm too clean


[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Girl it ain't nothing to a young rich nigga just to pull up clean on em
Pullin' up stuntin' on that "fuck them niggas" baby girl put a scene on 'em
All them lil bitches, so bad, lil bitch, so bad, put a ring on her
Girl it ain't nothing for a young nigga pulling up clean on em
I'm pulling up clean, clean
Pulling up clean(with her), clean, clean
What the fuck you niggas think, think?
Bitch I'm pulling up clean, clean
Pulling up clean


[Verse 2: Chaz King]
All of my niggas 100 baby
You show me love I appreciate it
I pull up clean, bouta get lit gettin' hella crazy
So bad you need a ring
Maybe its the Maybelline
I do not trust these fuck niggas, most of these niggas make believe
How dare they making memes
I get money with my team
(skrt, skrt) Yea, pull up hoe
Hol' up my homies is chasing dreams
Tory Lanez, Stupid G
Young niggas we just tryna eat
Listen baby, tell me what you need
If I got it you ain't gotta reach
Hell naw to the no no
You, me, and Henny girl you wanna chill?
Hanging with a nigga like me is a good feel
Yea you know that we lit
All that ass in them jeans girl, yea you know you the shit

Long days, longer night
Shit can happen if you play it right
Aw man, they acting like they got us right
Tell me why you lying? Why the fuck is you lying?


[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Girl it ain't nothing to a young rich nigga just to pull up clean on ya
Pullin' up standing on them fuck ass niggas baby girl put a scene on ya
[?] Bitch so bad, lil bitch so bad, put a ring on her
Girl it ain't nothing for a young nigga pulling up clean, I'm pulling up clean, clean
Pulling up clean(with her), clean, clean
What the fuck you niggas think, think?
Bitch I'm pulling up clean, clean
Pulling up clean
