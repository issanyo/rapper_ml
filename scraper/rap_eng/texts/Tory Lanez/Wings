[Intro]
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, oh yeah yeah yeah
Yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I can't believe it I did it all to get it and livin' and riskin' it all to live it all
For suckers that shitted on me and bitches that didn't call
And niggas that doubted, hated, plotted my town fall but never got it
I made it, I'm watchin' they frown fall
Ain't no better feelin', nigga, sayin' you better kill it
The last nigga that got it done did it big
And you could potentially do it bigger
Eventually to the figures that move you in the position here enemies shoot to kill you
I am livin' fast and I have notice time is an essence
And I'm thankin' God in a clock, I noticed time is a blessin'
And bitches just like the feds, cuffin', try and arrest them
My luck was on this dummy while on this ride to progression
I'm barely focused on jewelry, fuck it diamonds' a stresser
I want you to love me for me and I was shinin' on my chest
So I do livin' while enjoyin' the finer things
I owe the shit outta y'all for givin' me fucking wings, thank you

[Chorus]
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row

[Verse 2]
And I owe this shit all to Shawn for showin' me all the wrongs
He told me I have a chance, I told him, "It's fuckin' on"
He knew my verses was wild, he sat and nurtured my style
He always would have these discussions, I sat and I heard him mad
He said, "Don't get caught up with women, don't be concerned with a child
They vividly ain't the catcher, this industry it ain't with you
The niggas you callin' friends is the niggas that play to get you
And always stay on your grind if it's dollar signs that you picture and shit
Remember your sound and remember who found you
And when you blow, just remember who was never around you
All them niggas that clowned you and the bitches that downed you
When you doin' something they go and go and look at you or somethin'
But all they do is frontin', so fuck them, to you, they nothin'
See that you knew they stuntin', they act like you new or somethin'"
So livin' good and enjoyin' the flyer things
I owe this shit all to Shawn for giving me fuckin' wings, my nigga

[Chorus]
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row

[Verse 3]
I be like hell, ain't no way is not over
My memory takin' me back to that day in October
Me and my brother Jay was sittin' right there on that corner
Our faces was full of tears, just waitin' to blow up
All our niggas was job stuntin', we shoulda been job huntin'
But fuck it we was some drop outs, ready to rob somethin'
And I'm livin' in sin, I'm a shawty nigga
Jay helped me settle down, always got me, my nigga
Was live in broken homes, took me from open homes
His mother let me live inside her house with open arms
Cold as December night, shit, you remember right?
We stayed up late, just fantasizin' 'bout that lemon life
Now that I got it, you need it, I'm fuckin' 'bout it
I see it and everywhere we gon' be there nigga, I'm promisin'
Livin' good, enjoyin' the finer things
I owe this shit all to you for givin me fuckin' wings, my nigga

[Chorus]
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
How does it feel now? The rain is calmin' after the row
