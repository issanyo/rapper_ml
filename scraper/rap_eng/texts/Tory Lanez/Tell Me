[Chorus: Amel Larrieux]
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to, yeah

[Verse 1: Rory Fresco]
I just left the loft, racing the in car
Yeah, your body's soft, can make my body hard
Won't neglect you, do what your body want
I'll protect you, I'll be your body guard
Long nights on a big plane, big plane
Long nights with the dick game, dick game
I've been looking for a thick thang, big thang
Super freak like I'm Rick James, Rick James
And I heard your man tripping
Trigger finger itching, don't take much to squeeze
Pillow full of make up, make up
Tomorrow you gon' wake up to me
She said, boy, why you flex like that?
Why you gotta put it in my chest like that?
Why you take my sole, just finesse like that?
I ain't even really get no rest like that, like that

[Chorus: Rory Fresco +  Amel Larrieux]
I said, tell me if you want me to give you all my time
Wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you , tell me if you ( yeah)

[Verse 2: Tory Lanez]
I got a question
You're so impressive, how can I impress you?
Sit you down like a lecture
Now you're down and I lay it down on a dresser
I'm [??], I'm waking up next to you
Don't wait to love
No baby, no, ooh, no
Should've never let you get up with that nigga that you got right now
[??] tryna fix this shit is right now
So I'ma get up on god and get my pay
Dip and [??] on the corner to get my change
[??] in the morning, I get my heart back

[Chorus: Amel Larrieux]
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to, yeah

[Verse 3: Zoey Dollarz]
Tell me if you want it
Tell me when you need it
I'll be there, oh, tell me you believe it
Tell me you the judge, in this case, I can beat it
Tell me I can pull on your hair, ah
Making faces, you can watch me in the mirror
How I feel is fuck a redbone, call it horny, that's devlish, I say we dead wrong

[Verse 4: Rory Fresco]
Real nigga, I'm a real nigga
I could pull up on your crib and come and chill with you
If your nigga got a issue, might not want to deal with you
'Cause my niggas keep the Tommy, we ain't talking Hilfigher, hell nah
Pull up in some shit you ain't never seen, yeah
I'm the perfect one is what you said to me, yeah
It ain't too many niggas that's ahead of me, yeah
I'm tryna get you anything and everything, yeah

[Chorus: Amel Larrieux]
Tell me if you want me to give you all my time
I wanna make it good for you 'cause you blow my mind
I promise, boy, that I'll be true, you're the perfect find
So tell me if you want me to, yeah
