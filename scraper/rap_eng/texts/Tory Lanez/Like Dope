[Chorus: Anthony Danza]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Smoking on, smoking on dope, uh
Looking like, feeling like dope

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
Who don't wanna play?
I'm drop topping in these foreigns on off these southern dames
Playing games, I'ma fuck it
Ima brain Jay coppin plus chain chains swinging, singing songs Bad bitches hittin' bones switching, lanes
Niggas, chain thicker than my dang bang
Nigga, let that semi hang
Nigga, I be all up in the house, I want everything nigga
First time, she let me even hang with 'em look
Still gettin' paper off the block
Gotta take it off the top, used to scrape it off the block, uh
Young Fargo, you know a nigga flying over the border like I just missed cargo
Baby, you know, smoking on the 5-0
Got them bad bitches rolling but I'm ducking all the 5-0s, uh
And I'm fucking 'bout nine hoes
Got these bitches moaning like Alonzo

[Chorus: Anthony Danza]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Smoking on, smoking on dope, uh
Looking like, feeling like dope

[Verse 2: Audio Push]
I feel like I'm on dope when I ain't wit' you (bounce bounce)
I need to hear my dope when I miss you
I'm stackin' paper like magazine issues
It's always an issue I can't commit, but you know everything I do is official
So you don't press nothin'
I hit the studio I tell Amin√© to press buttons
Niggas know those checks comin'
I make her rock the boat like game-X
She fuckin' me cuz I'm famous
Killin' every beat until I leave the game stretched
I feel like I'm on dope
She wanna get high
If you tryna smoke
Then get up in the ride
Cuz it's lit at every show
There's women on side
But I don't ever go
But she want it tonight
So it's going down
I'ma let you know it now flyest nigga doin' it
And what I say go so she ridin' if I'm coolin'
If I'm chillin' in my section assuming you need direction
Finessing, forever on that next like a Jetson

[Chorus: Anthony Danza]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Smoking on, smoking on dope, uh
Looking like, feeling like dope

[Verse 3: Anthony Danza]
Uh, I'm high like hello
Stuck like the seatbelt
Put me in the hot seat
I'ma make the seat melt
Young entrepreneurial
Countin' money, eatin' cereal
My glass is so full point of view is so aeriel
My peanut butter leather
With that peanut butter sweater
I can't believe it's not butter
It's just a little better
No vendetta, you bitches is so forgettable
Forget 'em and get 'em a boat
K to they burial
Geometry gold ropes and heavy links
It's big bricks small circles let's not overthink
Surrounded by these sundresses
Flat-screen T.V.s, V.V.S.s
And brand new B.B.S.s
Addicted to the Mormon eyes, pretty lips
Caprisun with the molly, who wan' take a sip
Unc cuz you know the drill, you know the scale, gonna make it tip
Soft serve everything, dairy queen, everything dip

[Chorus: Anthony Danza]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Smoking on, smoking on dope, uh
Looking like, feeling like dope, uh

[Outro]
Young nigga feelin' like he on dope
Gimme more, gimme more
That's how I'm livin' out, livin' out
Blowin' dope, blowin' dope
Young niggas movin' dope you know how it go
Get at me
And when I say dope I mean types yo' kush
