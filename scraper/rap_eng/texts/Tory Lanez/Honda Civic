[Verse 1]
You got, somethin' that I do want, somethin' that you do got
You, so fly, I'll fly your ass, I'll fly you to Dubai
Move round the blue sky, drive in a new ride
You so bad you can't come, round my niggas
'Cause all us thirsty, really though
We be goin' in, like we all got curfews, really though
By the way, who the fuck, is knock-knockin' at the function?
Man, I hate when a nigga cockblockin' at the function
I'm tryna get laid tonight
Tryna find a group of all girls who down for their ladies night
'Cause you know it's on when I come
Pullin' up clean in my Nike Airs
Nightmares at the bottom
Got up mobbin' through the city of the eve
In my Yves Saint Laurent shirts and palm sleeves
But you know, that it's all for you
And when I'm down on the ground and fucked up
Girl, I'll call for you
Know that you're needed, know that you're needed
'Cause when these hoes hoed out and these niggas sold out
Girl, you still down

[Hook]
You're always down
You're always down
You're always down
You're always down
Don't, don't go
Don't stay
Don't, can we go?
Don't, don't go
Don't stay
Don't, can we go?

[Verse 2]
I swear you been down since 6th grade
Down with all my shit, I didn't even have shit straight yet
You remember them days?
Nigga probably wouldn't eat
If it wasn't for you workin' at the Micky D's real late
Girl I, thuggin', hustlin', strugglin'
Tryna bring money in, you know you were there for that
I remember that day, you lent me your Civic
It ran outta gas but I ain't have money to pay but
Fuck it, I'm on now, my money is long now
Got drivers to open the door now
Put diamonds in both of your drawers now
And you know this shit for you
Fuck with your nigga, baby
I been that nigga since day 1
The one that you talk to when shit is crazy
Lately I feel like we lost touch, wanna gain that back
I wanna lean on you without havin' to drink that Act'
Girl, you know, don't wanna think that back
I wanna give my trust but, don't wanna take that back

[Bridge]
Girl, let me know if, you are down for this
'Cause I'm so, so down
Oh it will go down
And when it does go, and when it does go
Just know I love you, and you know its true
Fuck with me tonight, I think this shit right
I did this shit right
I think this feel right
I think this feel right
I think this feel right

[Hook]
You're always down
You're always down
You're always down
You're always down
Don't, don't go
Don't stay
Don't, can we go
Don't, don't go
Don't stay
Don't, can we go
