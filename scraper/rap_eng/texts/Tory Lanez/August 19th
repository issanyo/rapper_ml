[Intro]
Turn me, turn the, turn the beat down a little bit
Now I'm not just sayin' that shit just for the intro
Yeah, yeah, I sound good
Fix the pre, yeah
I'm sippin' on Jupi√±a and Patron, nigga
Some shit like that, you know
Uh, yeah

[Verse]
Yeah, I swear I'm feelin' like my greatest ever
Niggas like a cuban link the way we stay together
Shout out all my exes, y'all just made me better
I had a couple of your friends rock my favorite sweaters
Strip club or sun and rain. the way we change the weather
We ain't pay together
I feel like I got mob ties the way I made forever
Fuck them bitches
They ain't gotta run no numbers my nigga, so up in digits
We done paid dogs, made money, made sauce
Niggas got a feelin' nigga, not a single day off, nah
Supposed to attend the Juno's but I'm out with Uno
Said fuck story, cut a track with Rory
They want me up in Liv, this shit like 50 bands
They got the money but fuck 'em dog, if they can't afford me
Out in Europe on tour, bitches can't ignore me
Ain't gotta save no video to my phone
Them bitches out there would 'gram it for me
It's so crazy
I done came from beggin' niggas for Js
To sellin' out all my shows like I'm HOV, Jay Z
My flow so pimp like hoe, pay me
I've been ballin' out these shows
Gettin' money all day, stylin' on these hoes
Feelin' like I'm in New Orleans and hoes look at me like Mr. Carter at the 'Grove
Trap star killin' shit, slaughter at the stove
Miss me with the bullshit, I started like I'm Rose
Pissin' off fathers, got they daughters at the shows
Set the standards high, so I went and copped the Rolls
Went and copped the Wraith when I shoulda bought the Ghost
And Tice just walked in, man, he hot up off the stove
Killin' radio, I guess that shit we got in common
A 150k in a week, fuck a comment
No blog can stop me, no dog can stop me
Menace to society, O-dog's beside me
Check 'em, he might pull out, woah dog he's grimy
I was in the hall sellin' dog-dog in real life
Jump shot ugly but I ball dog in real life
I give the game insight to my trill life
Then I pick and roll this shit like a give and go
James Brown, mixtape, album, I give 'em soul
Plan to go diamond while a nigga give 'em gold
Shit is gettin' realer and my niggas gettin' triller
At the BET like, "How they give my shit to Tiller?"
I mean that's my nigga but I came up from the skrilla
And I want that shit the hardest, every artist gotta feel, though
(How you like that, babe?)
My flow is like vargas in vanilla
Have 'em all shook, give 'em Parkinsons and kill ya
(How you like that, babe?)
I'm movin' like Marcy and Matilda
Flow so cold, they could do it nigga, sly me
Screw face, capital nigga, we from the grimy
Shooters Dej Loaf, they don't let a nigga try me
Stretchin' a brick
Bitches they connected to my dick
I swear you woulda had to call 'em hoes siamese
At Hong Shing niggas cookin' with the Chinese
Hood bitch from Brooklyn, had her lookin' like a dime piece
Camp David sessions got me goin' in with Johann
Ex conversations nigga, I ain't tryna prolong
My flow so strong, nigga, the dough so long
Shooters that come with all the machines like Voltron
Niggas faker than the shit that got sold on
And they gettin' jealous, the flow is just so embellished
Niggas got it switched like somehow we made each other
XXL pissed, somehow I ain't take they cover
So they writin' blog shit, taunt me and say I'm wrong
Like damn, Vanessa, dog, I thought we was fuckin' dogs
When I was fuckin' off, these niggas was uninvolved
They hate they gotta blog me, they hate that I come in charge
(How you like that, babe?)
I got problems that I gotta come resolve
'Til them pussy niggas check me, I'll be stuntin' with my dogs
Wassup

[Outro]
They not gon' like me dog, I Told You. But niggas gotta respect me though. We run the city in our joggin' pants nigga
Nigga like Fargo, he keep it cooler than Teddy Pendergrass in a snowstorm sippin' milkshake with his throw on, nigg,. Jahlil, what up nigga? Canada
