[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down enough to flex with all the shooters
Shawty, are you down to give the head to all my shooters, oh

[Verse 1]
I came in, I just pulled it off the lot
Sailing like a pirate how I came in with the yacht
I came up off of trapping off the spot
Tell me if you fuckin' cause it's backups if you're not
I'm just, flexin', to hard, woah
Threesome, sexy two broads, ooh
Every, time I, step out, shit lit
I just, walked in, Heisman, your bitch (straight up)
Boydem tryna catch me with the shooters
Just know I'm down to catch one if you shoot us
And no more puttin' shooters in the Uber
'Cause they can't hop back in it when they

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down enough to flex with all the shooters
Shawty, are you down to give the head to all my shooters, oh

[Verse 2]
I came in, I just pulled up with the slab
She don't know her father but lil' mama call me dad
Go designer shopping, cop it, fucking up the tab
Rich as fuck, my chick thick as fuck, I had to brag
All these, diamonds, on me (woo)
Don't it, get you, horny? (woo)
It's late, but I, can't leave, it's lit
Rollin', top down, my shit, legit (straight up)
Police tryna catch me with the shooters
You not from the ends, you cannot fool us
I caught a felony and beat that shit the next week
I stack it tall, Lisa Leslie cause

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist game froze, you should see the way we do it
Sexy little bitch she throwin' titties out the window
You from outta town but you know what we get into

[Chorus]
All I wanna do is go out trappin' with the shooters
Wrist so froze you should see how I been movin'
Shawty said she down enough to flex with all the shooters
Shawty, are you down to give the head to all my shooters, oh
