[Intro]
You know I know y'all American niggas got all your high cities and states that you rep, my nigga
But I got a whole country on my motherfuckin' back, my G
Canada all the way to the death
TO let's go my nigga what

[Verse 1]
I'm stunnin', got a bitch cummin'
I'm stunnin', got a bitch cummin'
I'm stunnin', got a bitch cummin'
Whip doors peel like a motherfuckin' onion
Know a nigga higher than the whole Grand Canyon
Break a tree down like my name Paul Bunyon
Rude broad with me gotta try new things
Lil nigga fly like I tried two wings
Playground pussy, try to ride new springs
And I made her sit on it like my new swing
Do that, bitch nigga, you that
I be gettin' brain, you be tryna pursue that
That my old book and you be tryna renew that
Fuck nigga who that? Know it ain't me though
Lookin' for a husband, you know it ain't me hoe
Tryna get the green but no it ain't Cee-Lo
Stuntin' is a habit
Diamond carrot like a rabbit
Niggas and these bitches ratchet
Got your bitch inside my basket
Man I'm a fuckin' G, a motherfuckin' G
You can be the one I'm fuckin' but you still can fuck with me
My life A plus and my chicks a double D
And I'm reppin' SLS 'til the death, nigga we be
Stuntin' in the mall
Tints on the back from the front, a nigga bald
Bitch on my back, I'm a beast I'm a dawg, fuckin' warthog
This a feast, this a ball, let a nigga ride
This that east side, west end shit niggas crave on
Let a nigga guap raise on 'til the day gone
Niggas at the top better have they game face on
I be at the hot spot, swave with the lace on
Let a nigga be though
Everythin' big from the dick to the ego
Hatin' niggas tryna send shots, reload
Homie, you can have her, I don't touch stee hoes

[Verse 2]
Skeet skeet skeet
Niggas cheat cheat cheat
And I'm movin' these hoes like beep
Money so long, man, this a nice streak
Waiter in a thong, tell her bring the iced tea
Talk on the road is that's your wifey
Talk on the road is that she like me
Knickers got that Cocoa like they Ice-T
How you fuckin' niggas tryna be they wifey? Huh
Bust that pussy open like a bad one
Send them hoes home when the cab come
Tell them sleepin' niggas take a nap, son
Y'all ain't shootin' to kill, half done
Baby, say I'm better than the average
Claimin' she'll be better than my last bitch
I told her you can't be my fuckin' lady
'Cause right now I'm fuckin' swavey

[Outro]
I'm fuckin' swavey, nigga, you dig it?
I'm so swavey that your bitch wanna date me
And I'm lookin' like a lazy motherfucker on my couch
Bitches like ouch, come and let a nigga eat nigga cheese like a mouse
Bitches on my dick and I'm all in they house
All in your fridge 'cause I need a sandwich
Back to the neverland ranch
Back again with a tuna sandwich
And I ain't talkin' money like who the man is
That's it, nigga
That was my lil freestyle like the end of the motherfuckin' song, nigga
Just so you niggas know I'm on that Ignant Shit
Shout out Sunny Diamonds man
Sincerely Tory, March 26th, nigga
You better hide in a motherfuckin' hole nigga when that shit come out, nigga
'Cause it's gon' be catastrophic
SLS 'til the death with your bitch ass
