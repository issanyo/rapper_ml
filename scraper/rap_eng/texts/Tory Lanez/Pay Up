If you want me, pay up
Thousand after thousand, tryna get my cake up
My girl be ballen, even when she lay up
No rest for the blesed, so I've gotta stay up
Where I'm from, when the lights come on, you won't want to stay out
Got a house so big, she can't even find the way out
Got this bitch so much paper, she ain't even tryna print out
Ice up on the floor, yeah, that's what we skate on

[Verse 1: Vincent Berry II]
Bands coming in, might need a translation
Franklins on the skin, she love the sensation
So much money, now it got her hands shaken
So many wips outside, look like a plantation
So much licker, we might have to let it pour out
Flew her in from ATL, she might have to find a new house
Posted at the crib, and she tell everybody
She asking me, when I'm gonna introduce her to Mally
Slow it down, slow it down
Don't know what you sayen, plus I'm faded off the brown
Chain swang heavy, sayen how you like me now
Always on the chace, they know what I'm about
