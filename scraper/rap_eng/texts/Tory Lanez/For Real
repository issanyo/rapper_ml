[Intro]
Straight facts, nigga
Come through sippin' apple juice out ya Pyrex, nigga
Fuck wrong with you?
I got like 20 some-odd pounds comin' from
Never mind

[Chorus]
I pull up in foreigns like this shit for real
Pull out like Jeff Gordon, fuck how niggas feel
New Givenchy gold, like I'm sellin' blow
Work up on the scale, just came off the boat
For real, nigga for real
For real, nigga for real
For real, nigga for real
I just flew in from Europe with 200 pounds

[Verse 1]
Look, I drop bands on the low
I got bands on them hoes
I drop ten on a four
OG strains on my door
OG strains on my woe
Whippin' the 7 to get it poppin'
All of my niggas is with the brick
And got a bitch on the batter like Betty Crocker
Whippin' the 7 and baby
And I'm fly like a pelican, baby
And I'm pourin' the O in da 4
And I'm sippin' this shit, it's so delicate baby
I'm so rich, I don't sell this shit, baby
I fuck hoes in Chanel and shit, baby
From the first night, she ain't wanna fuck
But I had to finesse this shit, baby
And my niggas gon' get to the decimal
I lay back and then wait like a criminal
Come direct, we don't need the subliminal
Got some Florida shooters, they some Seminoles
I got bitches to popout the whole load
Niggas with bricks out the boatload
50 deep and they like, oh no
Fuck it, I do this shit solo nigga, oh my

[Chorus]
I pull up in foreigns like this shit for real
Pull out like Jeff Gordon, fuck how niggas feel
New Givenchy gold, like I'm sellin' blow
Work up on the scale, just came off the boat
For real, nigga for real
For real, nigga for real
For real, nigga for real
I just flew in from Europe with 200 pounds

[Verse 2]
I got fours on top
I put fours on five
Whippin' the O's on top
Dippin' the sauce 'til I drop
Dippin' the 4 'til I whip a pill
I give a fuck 'bout how niggas feel
I'm so real, I could fuck a fake bitch
Fake ass, fake tits 'til that shit is real nigga
Whip the exotic on Biscayne
We done moved up, shit changed
550 when I switch lanes
950 for some ripped jeans
Goin' dirty but my dick clean
Gun dirty but the whip clean
20 thousand on a nigga neck
Just to walk around to hear that shit clank
(Tell you what, can we hear something from the album)
Man, lets talk this New Toronto nigga
I can say I'm New Toronto, nigga
Talent for talent, you small fry
No, I don't do McDonald's, nigga
Niggas see me in the new Givenchy
Flexin' with my nigga Bleu DaVinci
Free my nigga Speedy out the pen
Pressure comin', let this shit begin

[Chorus]
I pull up in foreigns like this shit for real
Pull out like Jeff Gordon, fuck how niggas feel
New Givenchy gold, like I'm sellin' blow
Work up on the scale, just came off the boat
For real, nigga for real
For real, nigga for real
For real, nigga for real
I just flew in from Europe with 200 pounds

[Verse 3]
Pressure, my nigga Kellz said give 'em that pressure
Nigga, we bringin' that pressure
Came for the moral, not the lesson
All of us came out depression
Just to reunite and flex it
One Umbrella fuckin' Mob, nigga
Homeless kid, I used to rob niggas
Stressin' had me in a deep depression
Givin' niggas pressure, on the job nigga
I would sell that dope to anybody
Anybody tried to ball with ya
Times were so hard on the boulevard
You needed someone to grind with ya
But it was no one to grind with ya
No one's life was on the line with ya
No one was with ya at the 18 market, 4 o'clock, in Saturday mornings
Tryna split the dimes with ya, Lord
Whippin' the soda, you know that I'm gone
Just give 'em that pressure, just give 'em that pressure
Whippin' the soda inside of the kitchen, bakin' soda
Y'all no-whippin' niggas, know we got it goin'
Get it my nigga, that's pressure

[Outro]
Don't give 'em that pressure, don't give 'em that pressure
They want that pressure, know they want that pressure
Don't give 'em that pressure, don't give 'em that pressure, easy Fargo
Don't give 'em that pressure, don't give 'em that pressure, no
