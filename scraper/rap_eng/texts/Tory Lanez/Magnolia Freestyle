[Intro]
Why yes, fuck you too
What up, world?
You know when I said the diamonds was on prom day
That meant they was dancin' under the dawg like
In New York I Milly Rock
Got it in my sock
Fifty off the wall
And I press rerock
Got it in my sock
Got a lil' thot
That's a lil boat, boy, that's a lil' yacht
Nah, I'm just playing, let me get this shit for real tho

[Verse]
I get money, money, money motherfucker like I'm Jordan
It's the nigga flyin' foreign, make your bitches not important
Milly rockin' through the city pop a pity by the garden
Know you niggas can't afford it
And these bitches can't ignore me
I did shit like dory, I'm with some white shorty
And the bitch is like forty, she singing Mike Shorey
In the port loose ridin' out the Porsche coupe glidin'
If you try me nigga I be off the Porsche through slidin'
It's just me and lil' Aggy, Portuguese  lil' baddie
Pourin' drink off in the soda, puttin' weed off in the baggy
I be off in the caddie with a freak that's off a addy
Tryin' fuck me to the beat is like the beat is off badly
Fleeing off to Cali, I'll be back in the morning
Them boys diss me in the night, I get 'em clapped by the morning
Got the money clubbin' on the dollar stackin' and joinin'
In the back of this foreign, I keep a cool bitch with me
This never slackin' or borin', never lackin' I'm blowin'
And any niggas try and hoe us, we feel the world owe us
I bet your girl know us, what the man Riley
Two bad bitches like Kendall and Kylie
Let your man try me be another man dying
I'ma young sergeant, oh and by the way
I just beat my gun charges, lawyer like a maid
And just sweeping dumb charges
Shout out Jim Lewis I won't keep you bombarded
But we some young bosses
Can't nobody ever try to do it like we do
Playboi like Carti I want fuck Cardi B too
Wonder if I slide in that DM what it lead to?
Puttin' in position like we in a magazine shoot
Nigga I'm the man ten bitches magnolia
Shout out to the fans, African and Angola yeah
Throw the damn Rollie up, throw the damn Rollie up
Rollie so heavy that the bitches can't hold it up
Score so much they gotta throw a damn goalie up
Niggas say they know but they don't know enough
You know it's us
Shawty wanna fuck me for Chanel, she a coconut
Skurtin' through the parkin' lot with doughnuts in the car clutch
All thirty of us, twenty-six bitches, four sluts
All of us going up, the bank account's growin' up
Shawty threw the pussy had me tore it up
Now the only way to get it back she gotta sew it up
Yeah in New York I Milly rock, I'm on any block
Hit that bitch on Betty block
Gave this dick to twenty thots
Got it in my sock, forty on the wop
Thirty clip inside a extendo on the Glock, ooh

[Outro]
We just getting started
Nothin' gon' be safe
I'm hopping on everything, body niggas
