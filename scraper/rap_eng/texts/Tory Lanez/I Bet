[Hook – Tory Lanez]
She ain’t never made love to a real nigga
Looked at her, said I bet I bet I bet I bet I
Cause fuck, Imma give her chills nigga
Looked at her, said I bet I bet I bet I bet I
I bet we throwing money over
Fuck these hating niggas, all my niggas coming over
I’m balling like I hit the lick
I bet I bet I bet I bet
I said I bet I bet I bet I bet
She’s seen a hundred of em
99 problems don’t become the 100th one
Cause every nigga round me tripping
Ho you bet I bet I bet I bet
Oh yeah I bet I bet I bet I bet

[Verse 1 – Trav]
I bet you never fucked a nigga living like moi
Never fucked a nigga getting like me
I bet you never had a threesome with your best friend
Beat it in the kitchen, hit it on the sink
Now what you think?
I told that bitch, said listen, listen ho
I pass these bitches off like a give and go
Wrestle all these problems in that figure fo’
Now get it ho, now get it off
Big deep throat, I think I got a rack for that freak show
Shawty bust it open like a peep show
I bet you never fucked a nigga like me
I bet I fucked another nigga wifey

[Hook]

[Verse 2 – Yo Gotti]
She never fucked a street nigga, at least that’s what she say
She always with her girlfriend’s friends, maybe she gay
I don’t know, she from the M but she moved to the A
I think that bitch in NY at the VMA’s
That ho a thot, man she got to ball or something
I’m tryna fuck, she talking bout going to the mall or something
I’m like what’s up, quit playing, shawty you always fronting
Talking bout follow her on twitter, bitch you crazy or what?
I’m like I bet I bet I bet I bet I don’t
We ain’t got to talk, shawty you know what I want
You ain’t tryna fuck, shawty you can keep it moving
Sup with texting my phone, tell me what you doing
Shit

[Hook]
