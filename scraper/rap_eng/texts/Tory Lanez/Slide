[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
I'll bet you notice
You're rich and I'm famous and I'm on it
I'm confident enough to say that I want it
You come around, I'm comin' down 'cause I want it
I want it

[Verse 1: Packy]
Hey shorty dear (wussup girl)
It's been a minute (it's been a minute)
Got love for you (got love for you)
But we were never in it (never in it)
We had our moments
We were off and on (off and on)
Now we on whenever possible, I'm often gone (I'm often gone)
No complications
We could chill, but no obligations
You can tell me 'bout all your dreams
I'm still enjoying those conversations
I see you workin'
Make it happen, girl you that chick
And if you thinkin' 'bout comin' over when I'm in town
Girl do that shit

[Chorus: Packy]
Just slide, slide, slide, slide
After you work that double shift
Girl hop up into your ride
Hop up into your ride
Slide, slide, slide
Make your way to the east side
Girl hop up into your ride
Hop up into your ride

[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
I'll bet you notice
You're rich and I'm famous and I'm on it
I'm confident enough to say that I want it
You come around, I'm comin' down cause I want it
I want it

[Verse 2: Packy]
You got it, you got it, you got it
Don't play no games
You know my past
Don't make me say no names
Never did you dirty (no)
My record clean (clean)
You give me space enough, you keep in touch impeccably
Like "oh my, damn you must have done this before"
I'll be good to you
We go way back
6th floor to that dorm room that I stayed at
Girl you still bad
Every girl that I dated back then
You killed that
And I hated it
But you stayed around for me
Years later you stay down for me

[Chorus: Packy]
Slide, slide, slide, slide
After you work that double shift
Girl hop up into your ride
Hop up into your ride
Slide, slide, slide
Make your way to the east side
Girl hop up into your ride
Hop up into your ride

[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
I'll bet you notice
You're rich and I'm famous and I'm on it
I'm confident enough to say that I want it
You come around, I'm comin' down cause I want it
I want it

[Verse 3: Packy]
Ever since back in the day you intriguing me
Everything we do come easily
Never too serious
You never leaving me
I got the seasoning
I could be cookin' up winter or summer
They never know but they know to take cover
I got it like that
You were there when no one knew of the name
And now everyone does and you proud of the fact
Talk that talk that I like
Let 'em all know you ridin' still
Leave your car in the driveway girl
Let 'em all know who behind that wheel
When I bring it home (in my zone)
I'm throwin' strikes (throwin' strikes)
You should steal a second
Baby roll the dice and just

[Chorus: Packy]
Slide, slide, slide, slide
After you work that double shift
Girl hop up into your ride
Hop up into your ride
Slide, slide, slide
Make your way to the east side
Girl hop up into your ride
Hop up into your ride
