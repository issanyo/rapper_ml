[Verse 1: Lin Que]
Now we got nutcrackers, body snatchers, and heart attackers
Mine's the three combined, plus other tactics
I kick more flips, than acrobatics
So you're plastic, couldn't get more charge than my dramatics
Don't pack it, but got friends that'll let you have it
Don't start it, or else they'll have to grab it
Insane killer, my pain is out my brain
A dried up skull remains, another MC slain
Movin' in cyphers, I'm the lighter with the fire
You're purple, goin in circles like those Goodyear tires
Liars and labels on the other side of tables
When I unravel, I'll be kickin more channels than the cables
I'm ready willing and able to end your lifeline
Your windpipe's mine 'cause I'm inclined to kick the right rhyme
So very hardcore that you hit the hard floor
I score, when I do jacks I'm lackin' car doors

[Chorus: Lin Que + MC Lyte]
I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em

[Verse 2: Lin Que]
Now we got trendsetters, money-getters, hot lively sweaters
My rhyme's the best of two minds, like double headers
I creep the streets, by putting cracks in concrete
Let alone, I rock the underground from beneath
So sleep if you wanna, this day you'll be a goner
I wonder or ponder, at least you'll die in honor
Steam like I'm saunas, in my dome, out like chrome
Next time emcees are left alone inside their tombs
Their rooms are blown to pieces, you'll soon be callin' Jesus
Swell, melt off the microphone heaters
Readers are blind, read way beyond your crime
You're a child, hiding behind imaginary lines
Give it away with your whinin' and your bitchin'
Keep it warmer than a kitchen as I commence the lynchin'
Cut through the tension like machetes of confetti
Coming down on you 'til you're through, then I'm jetty

[Chorus: Lin Que + MC Lyte]
I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em
I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em

[Verse 3: Lin Que]
Now we got clowns, then I slow 'em down in instant replay
When I'm heated up I speed it up like a freeway
Your D-Day is coming, so summon your creator
The life fader, complex to me like alpha beta
Collect the data, you're gonna need it to defeat me
They tried to sweep me off my feet, they must be sleepy
They're gonna have to bring it stronger than that
I'm on to your rap, and damn not the point of your crap
Uh, so chill before blood spills under the victim
My grill's a pit bull and it'll kill when I say 'sic 'em'
See I can pick 'em out a crowd of a million
The villain, illin', not only here to make a killin'
You're under pressure off my hardcore texture
The wrecker, won't hear my steps when I come to get ya
Stunts who talk that junk I never front
If it's hardcore that you hunt, then I'ma give you what you want

[Chorus: Lin Que + MC Lyte]
I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em
I let it fall on em, I let it fall on em (repeat 3x)
[MC Lyte] And drop it all on em, drop it all on em
