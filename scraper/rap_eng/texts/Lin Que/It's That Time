[Intro]

[Verse 1: Timid]
No more excuses, we have proved that we'll get through it
If we do it in a union of congruent focused movements
You see, the field is open for true hoping of the masses
What's real is the notion of success through a passion
A unity of you and me, a view of trees, and a sunset
Memories of slavery but we're not done yet
We stood in wait for dawn to break and the sun to rise
Because the son don't rise if the sun don't rise
But I, can hear the future calling and I'm answering
Talking to the past and then laughing because we won't go back again
Asking them what's the best course of action and
It's no matter what the game, hit the lane and just win
Pour liquor for homeys and water on your seed
To honor the past and pass it on to the new breed
So yes I'm dancing on the 50-yard line
Not because it's my song but because it's that time

[Hook: Rachel Walker]
You know it's time to get with it
No doubt gone rise
Don't get left behind, go get it
Can't stop, won't stop
Follow your dreams and rise up to the top
It's that time, you're time
So don't stop

[Verse 2: Lin Que]
They told me the revolution will not be televised
But I done seen it with my own eyes on 1-2-0-0-9
After the Apostle's Creed, after we hung on trees
They are hanging on our words so we're quoting Socrates
No human condition is ever permanentÂ 
So we done rose out of the ashes like a phoenix in the wind
I hope you understand that you can come with an ocean
But you cannot drown out the fire that stays blazing from within
The L to the I to the N, The Q to the U to the E
It is what you believe if you believe then you will see
It's all up in your mind, Lin Que, Timid, the seventh sign
Spitting visine to the pupils, Helen Keller to the blind
I'm gentle when I write but I'm a dragon when I rhyme
So when I'm spitting on the mic it's assault and battery like alkaline
To non-believers and deceivers left behind
My case in point, like porcupines

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Timid]
It's not a celebration of the end of a mission
It's admission that we can bend our wishes into submission
It's the air of a new pathway, Cube's good day
Whitney believing in children and love songs of Sade
We can look in the eyes of a hopeful youth
And say you have unlimited possibilities and it's truth
It took a nation of millions and that was that facts
But now, not one of those men can hold us back
I can see what can be achieved if we
Grind like we're trying to push a mix tape CD
Stop looking up upon those who should be looked down on
And letting yourself be a sacrificial piece like a pawn
Let's keep it strong, remember that block is not yours
So stop living under its laws and get something much more
Opportunity's at the door and I've said it before
That we are the ones that we have been waiting for

[Hook]
