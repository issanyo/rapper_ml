You can just... walk on
You can just go, walk on, keep on
You just go, walk on, keep on

[Verse 1:]
Sittin', waitin', anticipatin'
Waitin' for your call
Tossin', turnin', my heart's burnin'
From the things I saw
I'm sorry baby
You can't play me
I just can't be used
I'm so fed up
Time to get up
Baby, we are through

[Pre-Chorus:]
I thought that what we had would never end
But now it's too late for my heart to mend
And although what we had was good
I've got to make this understood

[Chorus:]
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore
You can just go on
Keep on walkin', Keep on walkin'
Keep on walkin', I ain't talkin to ya anymore
You can just go on
You can just go on
Keep on walkin', Keep on walkin'

[Verse 2:]
I thought I told ya
It was over, why are you confused?
You made your choices
Now I'm voicin' my opinion to you
I think you're crazy to try
To play me for a foolish girl
You'll soon discover
You're not the only lover in this world

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Rap: Lin Que]
Brother man, ay yo brother man
The walk is long [?] it alone again
You tried to play me like a old 8-track
Haven't you heard I'm too fly for that?
You blew a kiss, I threw a fist and you missed
I'm happy 'cause I'm a check it
And now you're trying to sweat this
Don't try to [?] this walk
If that [?] left
If you try to roll up you're gonna play yourself
Now just clock me but don't dare stop me
Ran outta time, so don't stop, watch me
You turned me on, now you turned me off
Yeah, you knocked it
But you was knockin' too soft

[Pre-Chorus]

Oww, don't try to play me!

[Chorus]

Go on baby
Go on go on baby, yeah

You, you can just...
Walk on you
You can just... keep on

It's just too late for me and you
I thought I told you it was over

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You can just go
Ooh ooh ooh

You can just go
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
