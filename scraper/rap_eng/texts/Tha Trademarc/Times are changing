They say that the times are changing, and we're holding on
And they say that we gotta rearrange it, and we letting go
They say that the times are changing
And its happening to me
And its happening to you

It's complicated, not contemplating on changing, just facing the congregation
Causing altercations for entertainment
Cos on occasion, im motivated to chasing focus and patience
Deactivating procrastination, thats all im saying
Gaining a reputation for cracking the combination
Dedicated and im not far from my destination
Its self education, framing imaginations
My life is a demonstration to all of the generations

And im moving on, tryna get my head on right
Things are happening
Out of my control and sight
Man im fallin in, no where to live, nowhere to get out
No no no

Changing it, rearranging, draining' my patience
Im hiding away from dangerous days of manipulation
Theres no way to explain it, faces are faded and jaded
Theres so much hatred, i find it hard to escape it

And its happening to me
And its happening to you

Dont let the negative energy get the better of any part of your entity
Open your mind and set it free
