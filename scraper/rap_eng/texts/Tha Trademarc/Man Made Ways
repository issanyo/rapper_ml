[Intro: The Knife by Genesis]
Stand up and fight, for you know we are right
We must strike at the lies that have spread like disease through our minds
Some of you are going to die
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide

[Verse 1: Slaine]
It’s mind control, they’ve stolen my mind
I used to have the mind of a revolutionary now it’s dead
Cause the Devil got these images that’s dancing in my head
If I don’t take these pills then I can’t get out of bed
And I gotta pay the bills so I gotta take my meds
That’s what the voice says, it was never there before
It was another voice that’s telling me you’re a father, you’re a husband
The argument is hard to win, it leads to more discussion
Every other thought is rushing like it’s fucking water busting
I’ve been sleeping with the TV cause I left it on
Pass out from the Xani bars licking chicken szechuan
Broken fingers figure shit I think it must’ve kept em gone
Otherwise I’m like a ticking effin bomb weapon drawn
Pacing 'round the floor freaking every creak I’m stepping on
Thought I heard the cops coming no I must’ve guessed it wrong
Flip the stations all around, nothing but deception on
I don’t know what’s real or not, here on planet methadone

[Verse 2: Trademarc]
Look I’ve never been mistaken for the social type
Overnight mix and match meds and get the potion right
Name it, I take it, I took it, I baked it, cooked it and ate it
Like God made it 'till I’m crooked
Psycho pharmaceuticals rebooted my brain
My death is stained by whatever’s fun, the proof in my veins
So when I took it I stare at my reflection like it’s throwing threats in my direction
Now I look at life and cope like any addict
I'm an addict by candlelight
Every shade drawn, every day’s dawn good and gone as I write
You can bet it’s like street corner hustling
FDA muscle in funnelling cash into new epidemics
They usher in mass produced pain
Paranoia that they mask with their lawyers and brass
Next stop poisonous gas, chill the citizen’s strain
Chain smoke stacks burn us to ash

[Hook]
We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

We living in them days of the manmade ways
They brainwashing us, it’s America’s plan
I’m about to rebel, we all slaves in the system
We’re dying over money and relying on religion

[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]
I used to have the mind of a revolutionary but it’s gone
I’m dishevelled, I’m a rebel, I’m a devil with a bomb
As I settle every motherfucking ghetto has a song
Put the metal to my temple when I wrestle with Saddam
Yeah, you see the mind control divide your soul
I rhymed it though in ‘94 but no
Y’all ain’t listened to anything I was telling y’all
About the biochip inside you and impending war
I run over you fucking devils like I’m Mendenhall
Overseas they dying young, they sending y’all
The cash system is dead, y’all just pretend to ball
Glocks and clips, apocalypse repent or fall
Do y’all believe in the birth of a nation?
I call it control, they call it coercive persuasion
Yeah all of them serpents of Satan
I’mma build a bomb shelter, only let the persons of faith in

[Verse 4: Sabac Red]
We live a harsh reality, get our brains washed out with filthy water
Caught up in the thrill of boarders walk among the killing quarters
I form a line of obsessive aggressive ill New Yorkers
Who build a fortress on top of bodies with rigor mortis
We saw this coming, history repeats and beats its sword
The difference is now businesses are center of disease control
Diabetes, VDs, cancer, and AIDS
Increasing the obesity as if we cannot be saved
Faced with their paranoia avoid the call to actions in arms
Engaged the act of warriors we all paying taxes for bombs
They taxing the farms, the labourers make minimum wage
Here in the States them owners sick, they’re paying women as slaves
It’s the beginning of phase 8, new decade and new plot
They sit and create plagues, inject us with flu shots
Behaviour reform informs away from the norm
It’s mind control, define your soul decide your faith or get gone

[Hook]

[Clip from Network]
Listen to me because less than 3% of you people read books, because less than 15% of you read newspapers. Right now there is an entire generation that never knew anything. The largest company in the world controls the most awesome propaganda force in the whole world. So if you want the truth go to yourselves! Because that’s the only place you’re ever going to find any real truth
