---INTRO---
Jesse & Danika:
I live my life, on the wings of, angels
You've gotta tell me what you feel inside
(you've gotta tell me what you feel inside)
You see the truth has come to save you
(spread your wings)
Yeah these words are gonna make you fly
(see these words are gonna make me fly)

---VERSE1---
You can find me at my nine to five, to build a finer life
Inside this mess of mine thats intertwined with being mesmerised
I'm best described to last the test of time
Revolutionise the mind and it will not be televised
Best ta
Check the vibe
The real is kept alive
By staying positive, had better recognise and pick a side
See, in my field assigned the soul is still combined
So my lines are not confined by the heart and mind
I
Find their rhymes are less refined not tryna' let me shine
Despite the fact that we are blessing minds
Just speak the truth and in time, your words immortalise
I hope you find the strength to testify and live the best of lives
Throughout the rest of time, just let the demons excercise and if youre feeling mine
Then bless me with a sign, and say peace, out
Cos brother its time to fly

---CHORUS---
I live my life, on the wings of, angels
You've gotta tell me what you feel inside
(you've gotta tell me what you feel inside)
You see the truth has come to save you
(spread your wings)
Yeah these words are gonna make you fly
(see these words are gonna make me fly)

---VERSE2---
The words i write are verbalised, it's the sh- like herbalife
Of course the herbs will bite, cos im bird and murder mics
And im just saying word to life, you know im certified
I cut to spoken word.. and still the bird'll fly
Skill diversified like the stars observed at night
I shine to symbolise the truth and guide you to the light
Thats word to wise you might have never heard of mine
Im reppin' live til next july, thats just the freshest type
With the best design
I guess the lesson was just left behind, dont be ill-advised
Ill be building mine until it fills the skies
I got the will to rise it will not be denied cos i feel its mine
So at the gates when i arrive, despite the ills of life
The gods and i will synchronise, its no suprise that ive been vilified
I can see it through your eyes into your little mind
Thats destiny
Just read the signs and realise that every man will meet his time

Time

Chorus repeat for outro +
Thankyou father let it be, high fidelity, this energy will set us free
