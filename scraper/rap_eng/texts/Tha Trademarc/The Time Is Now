[Intro]
RRRRRRAPPER DUDE!

[Hook: John Cena]
Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now!

[Verse 1: John Cena]
In case you forgot or fell off I'm still hot, knock your shell off
My money stack fat plus I can't turn the swell off
The franchise, doing big business, I live this
It's automatic I win this oh you hear those horns, you finished
A soldier, and I stay under you fighting
Plus I'm storming on you chumps like I'm thunder and lightning
Ain't no way you breaking me kid, I'm harder than nails
Plus I keep it on lock, like I'm part of the jail
I'm slaughtering stale competition, I got the whole block wishing
They could run with my division but they gone fishing
With no bait, kid your boy hold weight
I got my soul straight, I brush your mouth like Colgate
In any weather I'm never better your boy's so hot
You'll never catch me in the next man's sweater
If they hate, let 'em hate, I drop ya whole clan
Lay yo' ass down for the three second tan
RRRRRRAPPER DUDE!

[Hook]
Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now!

[Verse 2: Trademarc]
Yeah, uh
It's gonna be what it's gon' be
Five pounds of courage buddy, tint pants with a gold T
Uh it's a war dance and victory step
A raw stance is a gift, when you insist it's my rep
John Cena, Trademarc, y'all are so-so and talk about
The bread you make but don't know the recipe for dough though
Aimin guns in all your photos, that's a no-no
When this pop, you'll lip lock, your big talk's a blatant no-show
See what happens when the ice age melt
You see monetary status is not what matters, but it helps
I rock a timepiece by Benny if any
The same reason y'all could love me is the same reason y'all condemn me
A man's measured by the way that he thinks
Not clothing lines, ice links, leather and minks
I spent 20 plus years seeking knowledge of self
So for now Marc Predka's living live for wealth

[Hook]
Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now!
Your time is up, my time is now
You can't see me, my time is now
It's the franchise, boy I'm shining now
You can't see me, my time is now!
