---VERSE 1---
Marky:
And i dunno if i can wait, another day to chase the sun away
Another phase to set my tongue ablaze
And i dunno if i can stay
In the same place, living insane, i need time and space
I dunno what i can say
To make you change your ways
When i see that empty gaze upon your face
Every new day creates distractions i must shake
Another worst case at the worst time to test my faith

Don't endeavour to belong, just weathering the storm
I'm peddling along, Not settling for wrong
Uh, exiting the fog and travelling beyond
The pressure of a job that i never did belong
Now im levelling the song, digital to analog
And with insufficient funds still listening to drums
Problems missing from my lungs, not missing all these chumps
Livin' for love, Yeah problems still come, but i get em done like

---CHORUS---
Jesse , Marky & Jordan:
Everyday problems (everyday problems)
How you gonna solve em' (how you gonna solve them?)
Everyday problems (everyday problems) , how you gonna solve em' (how you gonna solve em') yeah

Marky: Attn: Koolta, tell em' what to do

---VERSE2----
Koolta: Wakeup (wake up)
I ain't ready to wakeup
Spent all night in the booth, now im all laid up
Jump off the mattress, the bed ain't made up
Dont wanna leave, but a job gotta pay us
Eat breekie, get dressed, all the same time
I'm getting stressed from the closure on mainline
I hop in the car, its only 730, swerving for some petty, now im getting nervy
I've got work man, i dont have time for a empty tank
And the problems build up in the back of my memory bank
A sea of traffic makes a shark with mega angst
But i pause
And i start to give many thanks (thankyou)
Cos these problems are just minor agitations
A sign of middle class gen y lack of patience
So stop when im whinging, im sure youre getting bored
These everyday problems i dont need you anymore
Like

---OUTRO---
Jordan: Ive been thinking to myself, when youre sinking into doubt
Call my number and i'll help
You face these everyday problems
We'll face these everyday problems..yeah
