I'm focused, dead up
Don't get up, or never let up
Ferocious, I'm fed up
Dismissing the competition
It's hopeless, I'll trash their ambition
Listen...
Y'all want a class on tradition
On one condition
Forget the best of the century
Y'all talk about the best of all-time, you better mention me
Essentially, I'm the best there's ever gonna be
I hold my ground, you'll never take it from under me
And up under me, it's gonna be trouble
Hit you so many times, you see triple and double
Instead of one of me
I got more heart
More ways to tear you apart
Lay you down early on, or maybe in the later round
It's no different to me
You tap out, cash out
Or simply pass out, to breathe
Cause you face down, really
And barely alive, cause I'm an animal inside, hear me?

I'm what the game is supposed to be
Hopefully, you see what I mean
Knock you out, haven't seen
You were beaten by a triple team
Box you out, the whole scene and gleam
The limelight's my dream, I shine bright
Smash you! Front to back
You gon' need hindsight
In fact, when I attack
You lucky if I leave you intact
I'm prone to overkill
Work you over, til' I steal your motor skills
It's the same whenever I'm done
Your numb toe to thumb
And most can't remember their names or where they're from
And some speechless, stunned, lookin' deaf and dumb
You're weak like 7 days
Then afraid, I'm amazed
Y'all still step up cause I hit more men than Jenna Jameson in better days
Can't clear your heads, you wanted Jenna Haze

You want the man, you got him
And you can spot him, every Thursday night on TNA
It's like a spotlight, and main events in his DNA
"Who you say?" It's Kurt Angle
Beneath you'll settle
The best in the world, only guy in the sport with a gold medal
Future fold ends to the center
Physical and mental cause he's simply better
Quit playing around with those second attacks
He'll lay you down for a three second nap on the mat
If staring at the ceiling on your back is appealing
Get yourself a match and you gon' do that
It's a rap, you're trapped in the game
You a rat in a maze
Just amazed how I made my name
My fame is a runaway train on the tracks
I fight like my life's on the line every night, in fact
That's why I'm gonna take that strap
