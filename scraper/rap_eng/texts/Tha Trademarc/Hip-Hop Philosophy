[Tha Trademarc]
From elemental, existential competitive philosophical
Detrimental to meddle or diddle
Between belief and bein not commital
The difference lies between writin paradigms and Renfield riddles
It's understandable that cats are caught off guard in the middle
Mainstays of mediocrity
Your metaphor's a minute point five and jotted sloppily
Similes and jokes are punchless
Faggot rappers rather watch me undress than rock sets
I left the sediment to settle on the rest
My violent temperament will benefit my style
A sentiment to leave the mic blessed
Beyond this we got all types
Tryin to grasp the elements of hip-hop like tryin to grasp the concepts of flight
All your efforts left fruitless
Like tryin to teach a lab rat to read or a cockroach to write, it's useless
Most rappers ain't battle worthy, just a fuckin nuisance

[Esoteric]
Welcome to the world of this thing we call rap
You can be a nerd or a super thug on the track
Be your favorite MC comin out like ants
It makes the underground sick like images of Nelly dancin
Major labels can rob yo' ass blind
Like Daredevil if he turned to a life of crime
In this rap world I'm the black pearl, you a dingy
I'm more like Esoteric, you're more like Chingy
Cats say they whylin with guns and SUV's
But get off Scott free like the rest of S.T.P
This industry is sick, full of these consumer tricks
Have you sweatin Puma kicks and the Sprite Remix
Cats find it easy to throw on a loop and sing
But the game gets 'em fucked like a prostitution ring
I stay true to myself, that's my hip-hop philosophy
Grab the mic and go all out like
