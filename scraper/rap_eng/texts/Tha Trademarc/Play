Keep an eye out for your soul girl
Dont let the devils take you away
All that glitters is not gold girl
Hollywood is a dangerous place to play

Master of appearances perception is realty
He never cuts formalities - like reaching immortality
Considering how much less they like him in his true capacity
The person they know, is not the reality
Problem is, with spirituality, it needs to be naked
So if you're busy tryna' outfit i doubt you'll make it
I'm always yappin' on about truth until you hear
I like to see a person progress from year to year
(yeah)

Just because it appears that way, its not really so
Any imitation has limitations
You really break it down with time and patience
It won't be hard to find the right words cos havin' truth to relate in
Is vision to see
Even when your eyes are blind and your mind is shaken - quite literally
Keep your eyes open as you enter, never surrender, remain centred as life renders
Keep yourself together and just remember

Keep an eye out for your soul girl
(keep an eye out for your soul)
Dont let the devils take you away
(uh uh uh)
All that glitters is not gold girl
(it's not gold at all)
Hollywood is a dangerous place to play
(such a dangerous place to play)

You made the daily news, for the local crews its amusement
When you lose it
Then confusion sets in, and the change of scenes
People turning on you didn't match all of your dreams
Walkin' through the street wondering what happens next
Said you'd never change your ways but that'd blank the cheque
And you can't ever really stop a wise man once once said this train was made to wreck
Keep an ace up your sleeve, close to the chest
He won't be a slave to the reps
So place your bets on who's getting smeared in the papers next
Who's the paparazzi gonna chase to death
Takin' steps to defend what the paper said
Take a breath
Cos the glory came and went
While these bastards slept (prey to the game)
Bastards next
Givin you some time to reflect on a past that wrecked
Just make the best of whatever you get and never forget

---
Keep an eye out for your soul girl
(keep an eye out for your soul)
Dont let the devils take you away
(uh uh uh)
All that glitters is not gold girl
(it's not gold at all)
Hollywood is a dangerous place to play
(such a dangerous place to play)
