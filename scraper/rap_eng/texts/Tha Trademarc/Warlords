[Celph Titled]
Yeah, Celph Titled
The motherfucking doctor of destruction
Back with the Eso-Ptero-Smack-Y'all
It does what it does cos we do what we do, let's go

[Verse 1: Celph Titled]
Finesser, keep a TEC-9 in my dresser
Lyrical professor, keep you under pressure
Mind like a thousand computers, you better re-route your maneuvers
Cause my soldier recruiters murder producers
Who'll blast holes through your promo-poster
With black bazookas
We not playin' dice, but we some certified crap shooters
Rap barracudas, killa better pass the Buddha
We put a stop to your weight watching - yet you're still a fat loser
It's disappointing, but I got bigger fish to fry
Super-size a Great White - that's the type of fish I fry
You didn't listen guy? I done told you
Got you stuck off the realness and that's what dunn told you
(Can you stop rhyming the same phrases?)
No - My brain's been misplaced in a vacant space basement that the cavemen made
I drank some razor blades right before I ate grenades
Then I swam with crocodiles in a pool of Gatorade
And this just might be, Murder-Death-Kill part 3
But since then me and ES grew sharp shark teeth
Carve apart our beefs into aardvark meat
A Steak Tartar treat in a charred car seat

[Hook: Esoteric with Vinnie Paz]
You can get it however you want it, little crumb
I can leave the microphone bloody, crippled drums
I'mma fucking warlord, blood-stained floors
I'm the opposite of pure - drugs, pain, war

[Verse 2: Trademarc]
You want the god of war? Man I'ma connoisseur
A piece of love in my life is more foreign than your corner store
Lump you, dump you, straight to the water's floor
Pump you, slash you, knife you
Mask and glove, midnight you
Or just out-write you
Cause I ain't like you, you're just a fag
Your double-time raps? Just twice as bad than anything you ever had
Shit talk and you're zip locked
Bagging you up, and I don't mean Glad
Stacking you up and I don't hear your mans laughing it up no more
Running his mouth, or backing it up no more
Leaving battle fields scattered with shields
Shatter bodies and tattered rags
Smoking guns in my saddle bag
Cracking tags and the badge off of those that remain
So I remember the names
Of those slain - on this rugged terrain, fucker!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Karma]
Ayo I rhyme like Forest Whitaker acts
I rhyme like we under attack
I rhyme like Rakim is sitting on my back
Critiquing every rhyme, he's weakening my spine but strengthens every line
To the dismantling of a great mind
Can Chris Hansen save our kids on Dateline?
I'm drinking rich wine with a bit of strychnine
Knowing in my mind I'm never gonna see my prime
I'm getting mine's, by, any, means, necessary
Calmer than my adversaries
Is it imaginary or just as scary
That oils worth more than blood on my capillaries?
I'm not playin kid, I'll never take a (loss)
In this cold world, I just chill with frost
I'm hardcore, much more than a beast who creeps across floorboards
On all fours - The Art of Warlord

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Esoteric]
Ayo we 'fraid of nothing
You ain't built for this, you a plush toy - you made of stuffing
You ain't kill for this, you a slug boy, I'm hater snuffing
I'ma soldier raised on pain and suffering
You a pussy that be softer than a plate of muffins
I'm the type to transform a sandstorm into man form like Flint Marko
A premonition like the jet engine in Donnie Darko
These DJs have been in vinyl
Now they frontin' with disc breaks like Monte Carlos
My sound wave will ravage and rumble
Watch you rappers just stumble over your words, you actually tumble
I'm back in a bundle, I came first like the Gobots
My sight kill you lost boys, eat maggots like mic kills
Street magic, I write ill
You sleep past the Nyquil
I smash thugs with frosty mugs, there's your ice grill
Your rhyme book accounts for more white trash than Nascar
While I'ma party animal, I rep to the last bar

"At least we know this much Perry
(Eso) will stop at nothing in his pursuit to rule
Therefore, he must be stopped"
"He's a very clever arch criminal who must be put away"
"I have escaped from Arkam Asylum and revenge will be sweet"
"Oooo that is bad news, Commissioner" ---] Batman
