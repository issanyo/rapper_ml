[20 second instrumental to open]

[Hook 2x: John Cena]
We roll by in the pimp ride (then we)
Walk through with the pimp slide (y'all know me)
Crew heavy on the thick side
Everybody feelin this, y'all know we serious

[Verse 1: John Cena]
I'll be makin these moves so quick, you can't see me in slow-mo
Get your throat cut when you step in the dojo
Y'all got no flow, we be makin hits
You like a proctologist, you feelin my shit
Yeah - you all hype like a street team
I spend more time holdin a mic than Mean Gene
Makin beat fiends scream, they be lovin the click
Roll solo to the party but I leave with ya chick
Cause she know that when I'm flowin it's hot
There's a party in my pants, she be blowin the spot
Buck naked in the old school drop, givin me skull again
She give me free strokes, that's why I call her a mulligan
See me on TV, knows everything about me
You can't fuck with me, she can't fuck without me
And if you think she don't be lovin my thangs
That's like sayin you eat at Hooters for the buffalo wings, what?

[Hook 2x: John Cena]
We roll by in the pimp ride (then we)
Walk through with the pimp slide (y'all know me)
Crew heavy on the thick side
Everybody feelin this, y'all know we serious

[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]
Fuck record execs, promisin checks
I been cleanin tables now I'm seein labels, these chicks
Sayin "haven't we met," man holdin my breath
Feel like the lesser of two evils that I haven't seen yet
I got girls runnin game with a pimp strut
Big butt booty bitches tryin to link up
They walkin toward me, conversation and they body bore me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
Nas said it before, that's raw
If you leavin the club your clothes'll end up on the car floor
Man, I got no time for words after sex
I just kick you to the curb and be laughin next
Cause Trademarc is a clingy chick's nightmare
Even though you took me home, I won't spend the night there
I've had hookers to virgins, on they back
Wild sex all the way to dead lays like necrophiliacs

[Hook 2x: John Cena]
We roll by in the pimp ride (then we)
Walk through with the pimp slide (y'all know me)
Crew heavy on the thick side
Everybody feelin this, y'all know we serious

[Verse 3: John Cena]
Johnny Cena got the girls, girls but I'm not Jay-Z
I play the field, I never let the field play me
You see my Chevy? You know there's ten chicks aboard
Plus the whip got more switches than the mixer board
I'm stickin your whore, while you flossin your Range
Gave her a dollar, she gave me back a buck and some change
She tried to swallow me whole, I brushed the back of her wig
She called my dick Frank White cause it's Notoriously B.I.G

[Hook 2x: John Cena]
We roll by in the pimp ride (then we)
Walk through with the pimp slide (y'all know me)
Crew heavy on the thick side
Everybody feelin this, y'all know we serious
