[Verse 1: Quite Nyce]
Yeah, uh
Feel the fire that ignites steady preaching to the choir at night
Drinking 'til he sees light
Days been on the [?] bench, trench in the stench
Ran over [?] guys who could give a fuck if you ain't fam
Damn this government, no love in it because they lie
Innocent, shoot 'em in they back, pop
Wars in Iraq, so they [?]
They never lose just up the tax we fit the bill
They give us pills to chill
Drugs to hide from ourselves and guns to kill one another
Swear to God on anything that I ever loved in my life
I will bleed every ounce of [?] into this mic
Until I'm cremated, shiny watches and cars doesn't mean you've made it
They team with them, damn we playing media
[?] strict 'til your head pops
And broadcast live and direct, they hands out
Not for respect, cut the [?]
And watch what you say, they dialed in
But until you [?] fuck if they hear us
They ain't never gonna kill my spirit
Mind is trained, protect mines to [?]
They aligned the planes, then ask why we commit crime, insane
But I'll rebuttal if they were truly concerned
With our struggle [?] change

[Hook: George Carlin]
*But there’s a reason. There’s a reason for this. The owners of this country, I'm talking about the real owners now. The real owners, the big wealthy business interests that control things and make all the important decisions. Forget the politicians. The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you*

[Verse 2: Trademarc]
The spirit of America's so gone, so on the way
From rattle to [?] the battle is who say the least
Sway swing folks with hopes to increase
Aggression overseas
While black ops oversee all of us overly
Crack [?] to blast marks on ground zero
We found heroes and even in worst times, but
Like Nero, burned down [?] to rebuild
Fear's so dear so we kill
Any and all, our government's team of [?]
Connect the dots and propaganda the plots
They got us landing in hot drop, LZs
Get [?] Tel Aviv bombed on TV
See it's okay, to laugh when rap is rained down and
Have to get on the ground to half the age
Front-page New York post
Got most of the dead and dying lying in the roll
While US soldiers, prowl like lions in the [?]
I know the sounds on American but these days
It seems killing is what makes us American

[Hook: George Carlin]
*They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying, to get what they want. Well, we know what they want. They want more for themselves and less for everybody else, but I'll tell you what they don’t want: they don’t want well educated people capable of critical thinking. They’re not interested in that. They don’t want people who are smart enough to figure out how badly they’re getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago*

[Verse 3: Raydar Ellis]
Uh, sun rising, my presence a daily blessing, a lesson in [?] compassion, exposed in my profession
Ain't much changed since the intro with the Jacksons
Where I picture myself in five years? Not sketching
Every day is a rumour, my life that I just stepped in
I'll die with the [?] with good memories I'll be left in
So in essence I'm limitless, looping on life I live again
But where do you draw the line or are you stuck scribbling
Little artistic plan, worse that I'm revisiting
That get you thinking about the life you want to be living in
Rhyming for the sake of ritalin, no it's for the kids to safe the ritalin
Pick up their life when their presription ends
It's like you [?] your own, hyping the bridge
The words of your own story, your life you currently biting, hah
Non of it happens if the first step ain't trying so
After this song stop relaying and start relying

[Hook: George Carlin]
*They own this fucking place It's a big club, and you ain’t in it You and I, are not in the big club. By the way, it's the same big club they use to beat you over the head with all day long when they tell you what to believe. All day long beating you over the head with their media telling you what to believe, what to think and what to buy. The table has tilted folks. The game is rigged and nobody seems to notice. Nobody seems to care.*

[Outro: DC The MIDI Alien]
*Yeah, Avengers Radio*
*Dropping nothing but dope, intelligent music*
*Right now, I got my man Apeshit on the line*
*Yo Ape, what up?*
*DC, what up cuz?
*Ain't no'ng. What do you think of the broadcast so far dog?*
*Yo, congratulations man I can't believe you guys pulled it off*
*Yo thanks man, word up. Just a little hard work. I definately could not have done it without my East Coast Avengers army: Esoteric and Trademarc. You know Trademarc's the muscle, Esoteric's my eyes outside the station, taking care of security for us, you know what I'm saying. And speaking of armies, I'm about to get into some military-minded music*
*Yo my man's brother just got back a few months ago and he lost his whole foot, his whole right foot*
*Wow*
*They amputated it. I don't think you can call him like [?][?][?] his left foot man, he's having a real hard time and I guess [?] understand they are not doing a lot for him, man. You know [?] run around if you can't even walk around*
*It's crazy man. Us as American citizens really need to do more for our veterans*
Word up*
*And on that note, I'ma drop this next track, entitled "Disposable Heroes" by you, Ape, and the homie Nabo Rawk. Don't touch that dial. Avengers Radio, here we go*
