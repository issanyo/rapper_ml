[Intro: John Cena]
Yeah we doin things now man
It's just another day in the life y'know
Always tryin to do some big bid'ness
Sometimes when we havin fun
Some shit goes down y'know, you ain't expectin nothin
Then, somethin come out of nothin

[Verse 1: John Cena]
It was just another typical day in the summer
Me, Trademarc, Crouch and my little brother
We put the whips out, we cruise up to the strip man
Three wheel motion killin fools like a hit man
We on some chill shit, vibin out
But we still in the mix, fuck hidin out
On the corner of L Street, I locked eyes with her
I ain't steppin man this bitch had guys with her
She came through the crowd and walked over to me
Catchin P off guard, she actin like she knew me
Her name was Shannon, she was canon
She's hangin with Melissa, this big booty chick you couldn't miss her
This chick was like a fitted cap, all over my dome
Said she wanna be down, but I ain't takin her home
That's when she said she live right down the street
She love white chocolate, well I got somethin sweet

[Hook 2X: Rue DeBona]
Saw you walkin down the street and I
Heard you say you had somethin sweet for me
Lover.. (somethin sweet) lover.. somethin sweet

[Verse 2: Tha Trademarc]
We run game, fill the blanks in with your hon's name
I can take an Eva hot bitch like bum change
Playin hard to get when I step, I'm afraid
I can treat a chick like cheap gas and upgrade
Whatever you need, whatever you want
With Trademarc on your arm, girl what more could you flaunt
There's just something about us, summer fling got you wondering
Where I'll be in spring, but that's another thing
I'll be out girl, quicker than tans
If you want somethin stick hurr, stick wit'cha man
I ain't lookin for a lover girl, I'm lookin for sex
I can tell you I got money or I'm pushin a Lex
Whatever gets you hot, that's what I say next
Gettin passed through the crew girl that's a safe bet
I think it's funny how it doesn't take a whole lot
Trademarc's like an open flame, getting girls hot

[Hook]

[Verse 3: John Cena]
Yo... with these sweet flows, the streets knows
Whether we pimped out in streets clothes, we the bomb like deep throws
My speech grows to reach hoes - all over the globe
I got class like a Ric Flair robe

[Verse 4: Tha Trademarc]
Man I'm in and out quick like Jordan in the zone
D takin out a bitch like a pass from Shaq to Kobe
You know me with a extra set of hands
A bitch couldn't hold me man I leave 'em lonely

[Verse 5: John Cena]
If I catch a glimpse of your chick when she smile and fine
I make sure she lose your number, she'd be dialin mine
I ain't about a wife even if she won this right
I'll fuck for seven days but stand for one night

[Verse 6: Tha Trademarc]
Man we decked out John, the strict gutter
I'll have a girl repeatin my name in sex like the bitch stutter
I got moves lookin butter with a tight fade
Forever dipped fresh man like Minot Gray

[Hook]
