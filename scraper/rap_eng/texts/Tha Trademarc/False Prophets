[Intro]
*Beware of false prophets. Which come to you in sheep's clothing, for inwardly they are ravening wolves*

[Verse 1: Trademarc]
So let me get this straight
You base blind faith upon the book formed [?]
The dawn of fear built on guilt and genocide
Maybe you can let that slide
But I'm inclined to be a bit skeptical if you preach and teach the youth
Denied them the luxury of proof and truth
To reach back to [?] a primitive fraction, re-enect
A public execution like a peaceful resolution
Like it was a persecution but would likely just confuse in an illusion
A story they were using, to aid the revolution
[?] the retribution, to aid the evolution
[?] the restitution
And by the way I think you're missing the objective
With collectively infecting, been subjected so it's all just ineffective
Or maybe we're defective, of [?]
Flawed design and paste away the way
When faced or forced the pray, the fraud divine, [?] images
Or blind visages
Or bust civil lord ignored, the faith restored
We raise our sorts and not IQs
We praise our lords and not our views
The body counts raise on Fox News
And that amounts to praise and not blues
I guess I'm confused

[Outro]
*Yo get with me, I deal with reality*
*Loosen your mind to the truth and don't get mad at me*
*For some reason we think we're free*
*So we'll never be, because we haven't recognized slavery*
*Yo get with me, I deal with reality*
*Loosen your mind to the truth and don't get mad at me*
*Too many inconsistencies, too many mysteries*
*I don't want a God that blesses America*
