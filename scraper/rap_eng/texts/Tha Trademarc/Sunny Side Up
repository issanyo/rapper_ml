Marky:
It's an Adelaide thing from coast to coast
We keep it close to the rhythm that we love the most
Cos we always keep it droppin like we doin that thing
Paint a picture of the scene, keep it mad clean
Me & jesse, we livin out our dreams
Cos we keep your head boppin like its never been seen
We are from the far corners of a fine state
And i got a fresh brew, no rhyme on hate
See, a little drunk, little bit bubbly
Poppin these lovelies. coming through humbly
Through life like its marky in flight right?
Travel concord i got time on my side
Yeah, never stop it, bouncin up n down cos thats how we drop it
Vale ale mixed with pale, when im rockin'
Not stopping thats why chaps keeps on chopping

You know the sound, its driving me, drivin me

Jesse:
Day in, day out, yo im feeling the effect and
See the dj wreckin' on the decks an'
Project with my man marky (yo)
All up in the studio doing what we do freely
You can see
Straight from the lips, we go this slipped into the business
Oh swift
You can catch us in the mix
And we quite fresh when we progress
Yess
From the day to day, all up on them mic never fade away
Two mc's here to stay
On a track singing with a little rap lets play
The music soothing my soul, without the sweet sound yo i might lose control
No doubt, south adelaide sunshine and nice rhymes
Feeling the vibe and im like

___VERSE3___
Chaps:
Just maxin and relaxing just kicking up my feet
This beat so sweet you can't compete
Fresh food, fresh kicks, fresh whips n shit
All love for my people from the dudes to the chicks
We in the party 9 deep like a baseball team
I ain't tripping off of nothing im just chasing my dreams
A new york state of mind in the A-town place
Laid back, esse, so i slow down my pace
