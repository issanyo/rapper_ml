Arguing [?]
911 what's your emergency
He's hitting mommy
What's your location Sweetheart
We're in the kitchen
No Sweety what's your address
She won't get up


If you had wings, how high (how high)
Would you fly  (would you fly)
How high look if you had wings
Would you fly (would you fly)
How high (how high)
Would you fly look if you had wings

How high (how high)
Would you fly  (would you fly)
How high look if you had wings
Would you fly (would you fly)
How high, (how high)
Would you fly look if you had


[verse 1: Beleaf]
He hits your body harder than the [kick notch] [?]
Its like the 8th time he said he would stop
He tell you he loves you, I think not
I'm telling you that's not the way that love rocks
Grandma told me, tell you, put some nickels in a sock
And beat him in his sleep till his knee pop
I was thinking of something more direct
Like a gun to his head or a knife to his neck
A reality check for his blatant disrespect
You know something he could feel
That is stitched into his flesh
Maybe I should let the lord do the rest
But you refuse to put the lord to the test
I know you're tired of putting makeup on your eyes
And covering up them bruises with the same lies
My question is do you even try if you had wings would you even fly?

Chorus

[verse 2 :Kyra De'Nae]
I remember vividly he was gentle with me
In the beginning I never would have imagined him hitting me Now I picture him killing me and I'm suffering willingly
I discovered duplicity in this beautiful symphony
I'm not asking for sympathy just a friend that will sit with me
And will remind me I'm worth it when I forget my identity
The subtle struggle of admitting I'm in trouble was coupled With the illusion that maybe he'll get the muscle to suffer his Irritation and settle instead of fighting
I won't be needing wings and maybe we'll be alright
But he needs me
No relationship is perfect and easy
Of course I think about flying believe me
But it's only in thought, this ain't how I was taught
So before I take off I wear a [eight and a halve] [?]
And a Kodak smile here's my high top uugs now walk a mile

Chorus

[verse 3 :Beleaf]
Birds flying high know how I feel
They see my sister with her wings clipped
But she knows she's a phoenix
Though there are some things I can't fix
I fixate[on the] [?] locks, coming off that cage
You know break you out of your box
You yoke to that ox, birds of a feather flock
Your girls say yours should stay together
Misery love company they ain't doing no better
If you try to change this man
You'll be a slave for forever
I'm sorry this is turning into a lecture
I just want you to know that I love you and truly care
I see that you are stuck and know that it isn't fair
But if you ever need a friend by your side then I'm right here
Just stop for a minute say a pray
I know God can do it for you cause he did it for [a stair] [?]
He never wants to see you in despair
I'm praying for you to get the courage to walk the hell up outta there

Chorus

How high would you fly if you could go higher (higher) x4

It's hard to fly with a broken wing
But with God its possible
See you have a choice to fly away
But would you take it or would you stay
If you have wings, yeah
If you had wings, oh
If you had wings, oh
