[Verse 1: E-40]
I'm cut from leather not polyester
My cheddar long like tape measures
Stay with a Heckler and Koch protector, 9 mm behead ya
Charge your bitch like a Tesla or should I say bill collector?
Got more gold than a treasures, I'm a monster like Uncle Fester
When it comes to my family, I go back to pushin' that candy
That booger suger; that yayo
Or the broccoli, spinach or kale
On the front propeller
Whether Hillside or South Vallejo
Never rollover, or tell, do my time, go to jail
Showin', improvin' and
We never losin', we gamed up, never lamed up
Bitches be lovin' the way a player move
I'm fired up, like a firetruck
Like a barber shop, I line ya up, catch a fade, no hair cut
You could run up and get done up
Get a check up, from the neck up

[Hook: Kent Jones]
This ain't no ordinary gangsta song, song
But never get it twisted, you fuckin' with the original, the original
This ain't no gangsta song for you to sing along
So never get it twisted, you fuckin' with the original, the original
Real nigga said, Glock .40 on my waist, you could get that
West side, west side, you could rep that
If I got a little problem, who to put back
West side, west side, nigga this that gangsta song, song
West side, west side, nigga this that gangsta song, song
So never get it twisted, you fuckin' with the original, the original

[Verse 2: E-40]
I'm a top hat, a staple, tycoon, a factor; a pillar
Like Getty's, I'm in the picture, bitch, I'm a boss, I'm a fixture
I can tell you who real and who phony
Who counterfeit, who a mark
And I got a black belt in grittin'
A purple heart in street smarts
Me, my fan base, thicker than thieves
We sick With It, with no disease
I'm a OG in the game and I'm havin' my grilled cheese
You could tell by the way my diamonds be shinin' when I say cheese
First rapper on wax to ever say, "fo sheez"
Fetty longer than the neck on a flamingo
It's more then just my raps and my lingo
And you can find me in Reno, up in the Peppermill Casino
You fuckin' with the original, gas nova instrumental
99 BPM tempo, trunk throbbin' slappin' tremendo

[Hook: Kent Jones]
This ain't no ordinary gangsta song, song
But never get it twisted, you fuckin' with the original, the original
This ain't no gangsta song for you to sing along
So never get it twisted, you fuckin' with the original, the original
Real niggas up, Glock .40 on my waist, you could get that
West side, west side, you gon' rep that
If I got a little problem, who to put back
West side, west side, nigga this that

[Verse 3: Kent Jones]
They say it's all about the ends, it's the day of the end
You really got fiends when you think you got friends
There's no "I" in team, but there's an "I" in win
Without the "N" it's still we, game changers at the end
Yup, no joystick needed
Studied the game system and I was forced to beat it
Never was automatic 'cause I did it manual
You need to learn to take instructions before you read it

[Hook: Kent Jones]
This ain't no gangsta song, song
But never get it twisted, you fuckin' with the original, the original
This ain't no gangsta song for you to sing along
So never get it twisted, you fuckin' with the original, the original
Real niggas said, Glock .40 on my waist, you could get that
West side, west side, you gon' rep that
If I got a little problem, who to put back
West side, west side, nigga this that gangsta song, song
West side, west side, nigga this that gangsta song, song
So never get it twisted, you fuckin' with the original, the original

[Verse 4: Kent Jones]
They say it's all about the ends, at the day of the end
You really got fiends when you think you got friends
There's no ''I'' in team but there's an ''I''' in when
Without the end it's still the we, game changes at the end
Yup no joystick needed, studied the game system
And I was forced to beat it, nothing's was automatic
'cause I did it manual, you need to learn to take instructions Before you read it, this ain't no -
