[Intro]
Chops on the track motherfuckers

[Chorus]
Cherry 64 (my lowrider), hop in the lo-lo, (my-my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black Impala (my lowrider, my my lowrider)
3-wheelin' the 6-4 (my lowrider), hop in the lo-lo (my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black Impala (My-my lowrider, my lowrider)

[Verse 1: Techniec]
I see 'em tryin' shine like Tech, cause I shine like I be
Grindin' on the set, d-d-diamonds on my neck
Most talked about when I hit that strip, watch it bounce when I hit that dip
Come too close might get that clip, click bang don't trip
Tech don't slip, laces up the roll go get my bitch
Get my grip, talk my shit, hit my switch and dip
Switchin' lanes on them Dana-Danes, same color as that candy paint
Tangerine with mental flame, birthday boy

[Verse 2: E40]
I tried to never sober, chalupa, longer then a roller coster
Out hear a hub-a-head'll do ya' for quarter ounce of yola
Venomous snakes, like some cobras, up top is where I'm from
We lettin' our nuts hang over our shoulders, figure 8 and go and duck
Droppin' with all 4 doors open, gassin' and breakin' and yolkin'
We hyphy, we stewin, Vallejo, Richmond, Frisco and Oakland
We 9ers, we Raiders (yeet), we some hustlers and some playas'
We got 64s and low-lows, but most of us ride Scrapas'

[Verse 3: Crooked I]
Lord forgive me, you sent me to tote semi's
Gulp Henny and Remy my pockets was so skinny
Now I blow pennies on 4 Hemi's
Run the whole city, hoes, I put dough before any
My 6th sense help me view better cheddar kid
I fucks more hoes than Hugh Heffner ever did
That new leather shit, the Coupe hella' sick
Dude move ahead of whoever cause dude never quit

[Chorus]
Cherry 64 (my lowrider), hop in the lo-lo, (my-my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black Impala (my lowrider, my my lowrider)
3-wheelin' the 6-4 (my lowrider), hop in the lo-lo (my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black Impala (My-my lowrider, my lowrider)

[Verse 4: Chingy]
Cranberry Impala, that's my lowrider
Slide by your North sider rida' with a ho' driver
G'd up from the feet up, plus the heat tough
Toe game crack the grey goose and spark the weed up
When I'm in L.A. I go in Crenshaw and floss a little
Slide a lot thang' in that Black Wall Street
Double U and P and CPT we keepin' it G
In our lowriders-riders-riders

[Verse 5: Lil' Rob]
We put them cracks up on the wall, cucarachas crawl
I keep my head up and it won't fall, no not at all
I'll break ya' jaw like a break the law, leave you all in all
The lowrider so clean, you won't know what you saw
I sit low with a tall can, in a brown bag
With a brown rag, bouncing a brown rag
With the Mexican flag and the American flag
Hittin' the fronts and the backs, watchin' out for the bash

[Verse 6: Paul Wall]
Homeboy, Big T, better know as Tyrone
Is the first person I ever 'seen with a Chevy on chrome
My parter 'bout it got the slab, wineberry over gold
Schemes in the head rest just to let you know we holdin'
I fell in love with it, and I dropped him some cash
Now that's me you see flippin' slab, ridin' on glass
How much it cost, don't ask, baby just know this
I could've bought a Benz instead with the money I spent

[Chorus]
Cherry 64 (my lowrider), hop in the lo-lo, (my-my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black Impala (my lowrider, my my lowrider)
3-wheelin' the 6-4 (my lowrider), hop in the lo-lo (my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black Impala (My-my lowrider, my lowrider)

[Verse 7: Game]
My 64 sittin' on that chrome, chrome Glock sittin' on my lap
2 hoes ridin in the back, candy paint, nigga fuck with that
3-wheel motion, I'm sittin' high, Daytonas that's all we ride
Hit that switch, it's do or die, ride on me, that's suicide
I be in the hood smokin' that green, Dr. Dre know' what I mean
Swisher sweet and them purple leaves, California, we got that weed
Black diamonds off in my chain, ask around nigga know my name
Compton's own, the rap Lebron James, ridin' low, I'm switchin' lanes

[Verse 8: W.C.]
Make that brain splat 30-thang thing clap
Know for the game rap with the chrome frame wrap
From Harley Davidsons to low-lows, we do tip 'em
13-hundred spokes with that blue nipple
Get the picture, disrespect and I'mma' draw slugs
But ain't no set trippin' cause nigga its all love
Dub C drop the real on 'em, Chevy chrome grill on 'em
Posin' in the intersection, 3-wheelin' on 'em nigga

[Verse 9: Ice Cube]
Raspberry 64 bring your cherry in
We could make a Sunday, come home Monday
I'm sittin' on the one-way, up on the Boulevard
Act hard put ya' thoughts on the dashboard
'Cause if I come through the 'hood with the little homie
Nobody better fuck with the little homie
I hope Compton unite, South Central unite
I hope my chrome, and dance with the moon light

[Chorus]
Cherry 64 (my lowrider), hop in the lo-lo, (my-my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black Impala (my lowrider, my my lowrider)
3-wheelin' the 6-4 (my lowrider), hop in the lo-lo (my lowrider)
Chrome hydraulics, all black Impala (My-my lowrider, my lowrider)
