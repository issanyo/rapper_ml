[Intro]
Mally Mall

[Verse 1: Jeremih]
Slid up in the club for a moment
She was with her friends, then she noticed
Know I’m that nigga stay focused
Ain’t no intermission while we roleplay
Still ain't never poked but I'm coping
See your legs closed but your open
Ever have both hands on the toilet?
Bring your friends round while we tourin’

[Bridge: Jeremih]
She said she’d never kiss her best friend
Baby that don’t make you a lesbian
Say you ain’t ever had this
Say you don’t smoke
But you wanna get sky high
Say she ain’t ever been skydiving
Baby, let me take you up a mile high
Let me get in deep til’ I fall out

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Physical is how we play our game
Loving, touching, fucking, it's all the same
She said she’d never do it but she did it
She said she’d never do it but she did it
She said she’d never do it but she did it
She said she’d never do it but she did it

Physical is how we play our game
Loving, touching, fucking, it's all the same
She said she’d never do it but she did it
She said she’d never do it but she did it
Yah you know she love it and I'm with it
She said she’d never do it but she did it

[Verse 2: E-40]
She said she’d never do it, she did it
Might not admit it, she with it
She let me hit with the magnum rubber
Her couchie exquisite smash for an hour and  not a minute
Smokin’ on power
She off the cabbage and spinach
High as the towers up in Dubai
Fly Emirates, about my paper, my buisness
Born and raised in the trenches
Was spittin' game since an infant
From the bay where they pin it
Throw a bitch up in the sky and break her before she get that cement
Never thought she would fall in love with a thugger
Reputable factor from the heart of the soil
From the thick of the fucking mud
I'm off a liter of oil
Up in the club with my blood
My people my partners
My relatives and my cuz
Everything that I do I beast, I beast
This watch, Patek Philippe, Philippe
Her legs is open like peas
She said her nigga pitiful
She grabbin' on my balls like a physical

[Chorus: Jeremih & (E-40)]
Physical is how we play our game
Loving, touching, fucking, it's all the same
(All the same)
She said she’d never do it but she did it
(But she did it)
She said she’d never do it but she did it
(But she did it)
She said she’d never do it but she did it
(But she did it)
She said she’d never do it but she did it
(Uh)

Physical is how we play our game
Loving, touching, fucking, it's all the same, yeah
She said she’d never do it but she did it
She said she’d never do it but she did it
Yah you know she love it and I’m with it
She said she’d never do it but she did it

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Said she never wanted no kids
What, how they end up on your lips?
Got your own you don’t need no assist
Said you never cheat on you nigga
Thought you’d never tat my name on your titties
Let a dog in that kitty
Never thought you’d admit it
Even though you told me I’m never gonna hit it

[Bridge: Jeremih]
She said she’d never kiss her best friend
Baby that don’t make you a lesbian
Say you ain’t ever had this
Say you don’t smoke
But you wanna get sky high
Say she ain’t ever been skydiving
Baby, let me take you up to mile high
Let me get in deep til’ I fall out

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Physical is how we play our game
Loving, touching, fucking, it's all the same
She said she’d never do it but she did it
She said she’d never do it but she did it
She said she’d never do it but she did it
She said she’d never do it but she did it

Physical is how we play our game
Loving, touching, fucking, it's all the same
She said she’d never do it but she did it
She said she’d never do it but she did it
Yah you know she love it and I’m with it
She said she’d never do it but she did it

[Outro: E-40]
Jeremih
40 Water
Mally Mall
She said she'd never do it better she did it
Never say never man
If she knew better, she would do better
I’m cut from leather, he cut from polyester
Bitch
