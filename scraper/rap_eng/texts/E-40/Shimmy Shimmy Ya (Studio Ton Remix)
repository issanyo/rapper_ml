Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon voyage

Verse Three: Ol Dirty Bastard

Most MC's get all too hyped
From the tent we'll rhyme and take you out with a tank
It's not MC just an MC bee
Weak on your words you never thought of by freein
Positive thoughts that I let come out
Ask the God A-SON I know what it's about
On the mic I'm a leader, school I was a reader
When it come to f----n I'm a strong good breeder
MC max and we worn out wax
Collect the cash money, without ever being taxed
And then I, got your attention
I'd like to mention, DON'T BATTLE ME at any rap convention

Yo I'd like to give a shout out
To all you live zaggin out there
And also like to give a shout out
To all you punk ------ out there
I wanna give a shout out
To all the true black women, because I love you
And I also wanna give a shout out
To them fake a-- b----s out there
YaknowhatI'msayin?
