[Chorus]
Dumping in da clutch, drugs in da trunk
No license an I ain’t had a task for months
My whip hot (hot,hot,hot,hot,hot)
My whip hot (hot,hot,hot,hot,hot)
Whips still rolling, so it’s all good
If ya blink ya might miss me riding through yo hood
My whip hot (hot,hot,hot,hot,hot)
My whip hot (hot,hot,hot,hot,hot)

[Verse 1]
Give it some glove and a screw driver hot wire and watch it go to work
In studer buggy slowly dope wacking a key a skirt (Skirt) a hoopty underbucket then kc might have to murk
Somebody hurt somebody make popping wet up their shirt
Leave a sucka stinking, not smelling good like a sirt
Not for joyriding but fo supplying an pushing purp
Take d scenic route, take d back road it’s high alert
Super thug dressed like a square know how to convert
Getting head, bitches don’t bodda a partner about his bread
Taking chances in d car when he might end up dead
Manage living in boulevard moving real greedy like
Shoot you in d face cause he really ain’t tryna fight
Put you in yo place, in d dark not in d light
With d shit like toilet paper an baby wipes
Nah this ain’t no rental, nah this ain’t what I bought
Take you on a high speed chase as d car horn


[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Dump her in d ditch mayne, from Bodega bay
Stolen credit card mayne, that’s a throw away
They call me four yard mayne partna I don’t play
I was built this way it’s mandatory where I stay
I’m sellin broccoli an coke, tryna keep ma family afloat
Me, you an a bunch ma niggas in d same boat
The academy fucked up, it’s fucked up I can’t vote
Cause I got priors an plus a jail record long as a rope
I’m tired a being broke, doin d opposite a soap
Wanna turn ma life around, but there ain’t no antidote
Grandmama say she sanctified me wit d Holy Ghost
They be prayin fo’ me, askin God to keep me close
I’ll be doin most, kept it hard headed until they get me
Dont believe fat means greasy, doin a buck 50 up in a 65 mile per hour (zone)
Finger on ma pistol (chrome), bust you in yo fuckin (dome)
You niggas betta leave me alone (leave me alone)
(bitch!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Some cars are stolen for joyriding
Some cars are stolen for transportation or get away from a crime scene
Had our story straight nigga if we slide up on a black an white
Open  container mothafucka running red light
I been hustling all night shrink rapid
Hot whip, fuck dem hoes they hot capping
Any nigga play that game, acrobat
Flipped from d impact, all with ma seat back
I doh know d register owner am in to five cracking
There’s a bag in d trunk, avoid capture
Bitch run fast in heels, she know the throw off method so she protected (she protected)
Driving round wid dat phone blurping, tell em switch dat line
I keep dat GPS off in d tunnel
Through d hood wid it, so they label ma car
High speed potential, D-boy at large
Too much baggage we take a cab to da headquarters
An bounce back, we have some quarters taking orders

[Chorus]
