[Intro: FMB DZ]
Lit, everything lit
Whoever thought that it'd come to this?
Everything lit
Lit, everything lit
Nigga, if I want it I can go and get
Hah, ayy, everything lit
Fifty thousand on me cash, everything legit

[Verse 1: FMB DZ]
Ooh, hah, I'm lit the fuck up
Yeah my bitch bad and bougie and she stuck up
Yeah these niggas tuck they tail when I come around
Me and Choose in Fairfield blowin' out the pound
Lil dirty ass nigga better watch your mouth
Or I'll have my young niggas outside your house
And they all dome hitters, you know what we 'bout
I be ballin' on these niggas, you more like a scout
Yeah I jumped in the game, I ain't have a couch
That nigga just got ten chains, that boy do the most
What I spent in a month, I could've bought a boat
Niggas ain't did what I did, I'm the fuckin' GOAT

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
Broke ass rappers always talkin', huh
Coupes back to back, y'all boys walkin', huh
You ain't on my level, it's a different bracket
Snakes on my shoes, snakes on my jacket
Dumpin' ashes in the foreign, I got bad habits
I ain't new to this, bitch I been havin'
Got a New York bitch I met in Manhattan
They love when I talk that shit so I'ma keep spazzin'

[Verse 2: E-40]
I don't pop bubblegum, I pop guns
And I don't carry loose change, just lump sums
It'd be bad if you got on my bad side
You don't want Doctor Skrill to turn into Mister Hyde
I was raised around hyenas
Ever since I came out of my daddy's penis
If I was a pimp, I'd be a genius
I'd be the first pimp to send a ho to Venus
My macking's incredible, I got liquor and edibles
I turn up like the vegetable, smoke a whole lot of medical
Ghetto Heisman like WC, I should get a medal
For being the first D boy to cook a whole key in a kettle
Who got a cigarillo? break down a bush
Roll it and light it, spark up the OG kush
Everybody's invited, this is a celebration
Real niggas united, no player hatin', bitch

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
Broke ass rappers always talkin', huh
Coupes back to back, y'all boys walkin', huh
You ain't on my level, it's a different bracket
Snakes on my shoes, snakes on my jacket
Dumpin' ashes in the foreign, I got bad habits
I ain't new to this, bitch I been havin'
Got a New York bitch I met in Manhattan
They love when I talk that shit so I'ma keep spazzin'

[Verse 3: FMB DZ]
Pillow talkin' to these hoes, I hear you chit-chattin'
I'ma catch a nigga out and I'ma gift wrap him
Once a pussy, always pussy, I'ma bitch smack him
I love Gucci or the Louis, yeah I'm mismatching
I heard these niggas talkin' loud like they a kingpin
My lil bitch bustin' scripts 'til the lean in
I just got another car, they say the blue one's here
That nigga Skuba dropped a five in a root beer

[Chorus: FMB DZ]
Broke ass rappers always talkin', huh
Coupes back to back, y'all boys walkin', huh
You ain't on my level, it's a different bracket
Snakes on my shoes, snakes on my jacket
Dumpin' ashes in the foreign, I got bad habits
I ain't new to this, bitch I been havin'
Got a New York bitch I met in Manhattan
They love when I talk that shit so I'ma keep spazzin'

[Outro: FMB DZ]
Lit, everything lit
Nigga, if I want it I can go and get
Hah, ayy, everything lit
Fifty thousand on me cash, everything legit
