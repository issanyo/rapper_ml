He's been hot for decades

[Hook: DecadeZ]
Lemme see you twerk

Lemme see you twerk

[Verse 1:  E-40]
Uhh, you make a player want to hit (want to hit)
Jiggle what your mama blessed you with (blessed you with)
Stacked, Pringles potato chips (potato chips)
Come and lap dance on my magic stick (on my magic stick)
Uhh, it's hot in here (hot in here)
You know how to make a pole disappear
Georgia peach booty, body (body)
Her ass is an instrument to molly (to molly)
She the bestest (the bestest)
I bet she got some bomb ass crevice (crevice)
Mm, all eyes on her (on her)
All the ballers want to dive in her (in her)
Hella thick (hella thick)
I love it when she jump in the air and do the splits (and do the splits)
I wonder if she takin' gymnastics (gymnastics)
Acrobatics, baby got baggage (biatch)

[Hook: DecadeZ & E-40 (both)]
Lemme see you twerk
Lemme see you twerk
Lemme see you twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk

Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk

[Verse 2:  Too $hort]
You lookin' ready girl, here we go
You on the dance floor lookin' like a video
It feels good to be dancin' now
You never have fun when your man's around
You get down, full throttle
Shake it all around girl make your booty wobble
We ain't goin' nowhere, we stayin' 'til the end
Give the DJ some money tell him "Play it again"
It's your song, ass in the air I see your thong
My dick got hard, you can see it's long
No we tryin' to fuck each other
When we leave here let's be lovers
We on the dance floor doin' the most
I grabbed her by the waist, then I pulled her close
I put both hands under her skirt
Then I told her "Let me see you twerk"

[Hook: DecadeZ & E-40 (both)]
Lemme see you twerk
Lemme see you twerk
Lemme see you twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk
Lemme see you twerk
Twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk

[Verse 3:  E-40 & Dolla Will]
Uhh, she fresh out the shower, lookin' good as fuck
Headed to the party 'bout to scoop her home girls up (home girls up)
Felicia and Sabrina, that's her childhood friends (childhood friends)
But little does she know, they 'bout to fight over a man (fight over a man)
It's yankin' in this bitch, they still comin' in
Line around the corner, whites, blacks, Asians, Mexicans (Mexicans)
The liquor kicked in, got to runnin' off at the mouth
Got full of that truth serum, that's how people fall out
Dolla Will man
Nice shape, baby lookin' like she got it
Wet wet, want to hop in it, drown in it
Size ten, shake it like a tamborine (shake it)
Two-steppin' off of Cadillac and light green (shake it)
Throw a few ones, pop that pussy for me (pop it)
King of Diamonds, niggas fuckin' off Gs on her
I'm a victim too, private peep show
If your money right, she a deep throat (deep throat)

[Hook: DecadeZ & E-40 (both)]
