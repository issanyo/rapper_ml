[Chorus: Chris Bentley]
I'm sorry baby I can't change my ways
I grew up in the Bay
Where the hustler plays
Aw-yay!
I'm sorry baby I can't change my ways
I grew up in the Bay
That's how the hustlers play
Aw-yay!

[Verse 1: E-40]

'Member Mr. Flamboyant way back in '89?
Well back then I was selling tapes out of the trunk of mine
I put my car into park and let the beat explode
Within an hour, guess how many tapes I sold?
I got the power, I'm feeling my Wheaties I can't stop
I bought a clothing store right down the street from Rich Art's barber shop
Now I'm popping, ain't nothing wrong with nothing I do
As long as I pay my tithes and the internal revenue
I'm booking studio time, Solano Avenue
At Studio Ton's to make a hit or two
Classics for the future that ghetto gold super duper
Hits like Hurricane and Captain Save A Hoe

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: E-40]
Money ain't changed me, money changed the way people think about me
When I was broke, all I had was my family
It kinda hurt me when they closed down (Who?)
The Music People, Jason Blaine and them downtown
They was around before I even owned a bottle
(Like that then,) like George's Music in Chicago
Like 7th Heaven up in The Show Me State, Kansas City
Jones & Harris, Long Beach V-I-P & T-Y-E's

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: E-40]
I grew up in the Bay, Cali-for-ni-a
Where the Oakland Raiders and the 49ers play
I hear everybody talk about where they stay
Well how come I can't talk about where I stay?
The Yay, where we pop our collars
Jack our slacks, and make them dollars
Write these raps, and spit this game
And show the whole world, that we ain't no lames
I can't change my ways, I been a hustler for days
The way I walk and I talk, it's not a fad or a phase
A fling, a fluke or a joke, or some old gimmick that's staged
But it's the way I am, I can't change my ways

[Chorus]

[Outro: Chris Bentley]
Whoa, Forty Fonzarelli, Chris Bentley, S Dog, we keeping it real
Y'all don't wanna see us
Cause we gone kick up a lot of fuss
In the dust, from The Bay to LA
We are so paid, baby
