[Intro]
Ah ha (X4)
He’s been too hot for the back ground
Ah ha (X4)
We show up yeah
We in the parking lots we already fucked up
Nigga off all kinds of lickas and shit
All kinds a motherfuckin dranks fuck it

[Verse 1]
Northern California, that’s where I reside
My favorite weapon of choice is an MP5
A lot of my guys in the cas a lot of them still alive
Some by lethal injection some on sentence to life
I went from pushin leaves to pushin pods and keys
Got the game from deda rams when I was a rookie
She over dancin like she wanna fuck
I’m the in fountain hotel ugh
Redbull and yegan ister in my motherfuckin cup
Backin it up like a garbage truck that ass lookin lovely
Lookin back at me like come get this monkey
She says she like it rough but I don’t hand cuff
She always come back caz she can’t get enough

[Chorus]
I’m in the room
Bitch the center of all attention
I step in that motherfucker mayne
They look at me, I look at em back I say Hello
Hello, heller, hello
I’m in the Room
In the room mayne yes in the devotion
The facility, the building, the party, the grind
I’m in the room

[Verse 2]
Zero zero I tie into something
Get of that jacket and clean out ya pocket
It’s on site, window tied for duckin
You scary ass bitches can’t do no fuckin
Ay I get on that wig
Giggle on that wig like a gorilla to a chimp
Aye lights camera action
Flash on that ass like camera action
Bossed up on that ass go get em
All I hear is civil back simple
Am I wrong for hitting your chick or am I right for hitting your bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The champ is here don’t let ya girlfriend
Or ya boyfriend  stamped in here
Ugh my heart pumps faith
Ya heart pumps fear I can see it in ya face
Ugh valet boy magazine spree
I don’t count sheep I count money when I sleep
Before I fuck that hoe I’ll beat my meat
My little homie told her pussy hella stink
I’m cold like freon, I glow like neon
I’m far from a peon
Gettin high like Cleon
Getting dusty in the wind like motherfucka
Ridin robitussin car pouches

[Chorus]
