[Chorus 4X]
(I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga, just down for my riches)
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga, just down for my riches
I figure it takes about a million or 500.000 tapes
To become officially gold or platinum status
That's why I'm always at this
Practice, in and out the studio 24-7
My occupation, this is how I make my livin'
I get harassed mostly everywhere I go
Can't do my thing without a motherfuckin' po-po
All up in my mix 'cause I'm tryina maintain
And get a grip on some lightweight fame
Born and raised in the valley South Vallejo
The northern part of Cali, 'bout my mail
Struggle and strive all my life in a world of grief
Sucker motherfuckers wanna knock me off my feet
But I'mma keep on steppin' and gettin' bigger
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 2]
Not too long ago, I'm off to the bank to cash my check
The lady teller wouldn't give me no damn respect
She started acting hella snotty, kinda prejudiced
I guess she didn't like the way that a nigga was dressed
Before I could even get my foot in the door, right
The bitch already had a brother like me stereotyped
Ready to push the button with no delay'a
I said wait a minute, baby, you mistakin' me for Andre'a
I'm not a fail tail rat head wannabe
I wouldn't rob a fuckin' bank for publicity
I get it honestly, legally, so have no fear
I make more in a week than you do in a year
Straight out the ghetto, Hillside resident
Sick Wid It Records and tapes, and I'm the president
So don't go thinkin' that every brother's out to get ya
I'm not a nuttin' ass nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes my language is vulgar, lotsa profanity
I try not to trip when kids' parents be sweating me
18 and over, that's what you gotta be
To purchase my tape and make sure you got I.D
That's all I can say, so mommy and daddy need to peep
It ain't my fault the kids dub it off the streets
They hear it at school, walkin' home and everywhere they go
And most of the violence come from movies on HBO
The shit that I be spittin' is real cause I'm real, see
I'm out to make a mil, do you feel me?
Holdin' my own 'cause I'm grown and intelligent
Tryna knock my hustle? That shit is irrelevant

[Chorus]
