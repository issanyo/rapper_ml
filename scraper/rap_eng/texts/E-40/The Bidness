[Intro: E-40 & Krizz Kaliko]
Krizz Kaliko and E-4-0 you biatch
Strange Music man, Sick Wid It Records man
We attached like jpgs, Tech N9ne what is it pimp?
I see you boy, I love you boyeee
Yeah, Krizz Kaliko man, that boy cold ass hair
Who named you, man? Nigga you crazy

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Kali Baby, now what the bidness?
Swingin' on my (huh!) like she's a gymnast (alright)
From the capital K, it's like I magically abracadabra my way in the game with the babbling, what's hap'nin'?
Now tell me what the bidness here
If the party ain't jumping got no bidness here (wow baby)
'Cause I'm looking for that light skin, might been over 'fore I pop it, let me right in
Yadade, gobble the dames up and swallow 'em
Get your- Get your game up and follow 'em
Nina put me on and it's over
Hogging both lanes, take the shoulder
I'm about to show ya
How we make the whole club jump to the dawn (now we got it)
Vodka tonic and then it's on (automatic)
A bottle of Jack, acting a fool, don't go to it, finish
Big Krizz Kaliko, that's the bidness (what you mean?)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Hey, hey! What the bidness is?
What the deal? What the bidness is?
What they talking 'bout?
What? What the bidness is? What the deal? What the bidness is?
You ain't talking 'bout nothin'
Hey, hey! What the bidness is?
What the deal? What the bidness is?
What they talking 'bout?
Alright! What the bidness is? What the deal? What the bidness is?
You ain't talking 'bout nothin'

[Verse 2: E-40]
Nothin' macking that's my role
People say that boy there cold
He a monster, he a beast
He a fucking animal just like my partner Kaliko
Slap a bitch with my bankroll
Always been at work since he was a little tadpole
I pull up in my old school mob with ignorant, dumb-ass throb
Out the work like what that is sohab?
Pockets fat like The Blob, born money hungry hog
Showing off my brand new broad, she so charred
Bitch ass [?] my kidney, put a sucka out his misery
[?] blowing big stinking dollar hater, but I'm money motivated
Perspiring over the stove top, cooking like a cater (hater)
We up and we cop it
Delivering and dropping
Tryna feed my family, put gifts in the Christmas stocking
Sucka run up on me then best believe that I'm blapping
Bust first, ask questions last, no need for talking
(That's the bidness)

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Hey, hey! What the bidness is?
What the deal? What the bidness is?
What they talking 'bout?
What? What the bidness is? What the deal? What the bidness is?
You ain't talking 'bout nothin'
Hey, hey! What the bidness is?
What the deal? What the bidness is?
What they talking 'bout?
Alright! What the bidness is? What the deal? What the bidness is?
You ain't talking 'bout nothin'

[Verse 3: DJ Chill]
Mane, I'm unbuttoning her button
[?] old school seven deuce cutting
They asking the bidness, I show her the fitness
As God is my witness a beezy gon' get chips
Now I'm in a soiree, asking Fonzarelli "mane I'm looking for [?] aerobic parlay slapping bar kegs"
I'm so old school, mane, even knuckleheads, mane, they respect the dude, mane
What's the business?
I'm colder than a [?] in December [?]
Bitch, we the shiznit
Big [?] then dip to [?]
[?] bottle pop
Snatch the young Kaliko, snatch [?]
A little top nutter to a young beezy, they know how it go
My nigga Tecca Nina told me I'm a playa, but I take it a step further
I'm an all damn dayer

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
Hey, hey! What the bidness is?
What the deal? What the bidness is?
What they talking 'bout?
What? What the bidness is? What the deal? What the bidness is?
You ain't talking 'bout nothin'
Hey, hey! What the bidness is?
What the deal? What the bidness is?
What they talking 'bout?
Alright! What the bidness is? What the deal? What the bidness is?
You ain't talking 'bout nothin'
