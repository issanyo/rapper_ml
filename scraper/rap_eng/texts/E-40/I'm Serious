[Verse 1: E-40]
Super bossy, no duplicate or a copy
The realest in it, I could turn a hour into a minute
I meant it, there's nothing new to a fixture, I'm off this liquor
Gettin' toasted and twisted, elevated and lifted

Money on my mind all the time until I resign
Thumper by my spine, out here pushin' a hard line
If you ain't notice me, man, you probably blind
If you a sucker, man, then you probably lyin'

I been around the world and back, and overseas
All across the map, rap shows and makin' G's
Livin' life to the fullest and celebratin' my legacy
Duckin' and dodgin' them bullets, man, some don't make it past 23

Refuse to be my own enemy, love the Lord and my family
Haters throw shade and they block my shine like a canopy
I made it out the cage, out the trap, up outta captivity
Stay in they face, on the case, they can't get rid of me

[Chorus: Park Ave.]
I'm serious
About my money
I'm serious
You know I'm always on my grind
I'm serious
About my money
I'm serious
I'mma get money 'til I die

[Verse 2: E-40]
Money mackin', what's happenin', gettin' my paper
I'm stackin' to see more ice than Alaska's, I'm outlastin'
The doubters, that haters, the nonbelievers, deceivers
The evildoers, the traders, the naysayers

You ain't gotta do nothing to anybody
To get bit by a shark, fools will hate you with all their heart
Gotta play it smart, be woke after dark, do yo' part
Keep ya stick next to ya, 'specially when you ridin' a la carte

Solo bolo dolo, lookin' out for the po-po
Life can be long or it can be shorter than Frodo
I can be wrong, but I'm normally right like a uncle
Smokin' the cone, I like to chief like I'm Tonto

I'm in my zone, almost at home, we on the phone
Talkin' hella grown, she say she tryin' to get it on
Make her moan when I bone when I run up in it
Put a smile on her face when I finish

[Chorus: Park Ave.]
I'm serious
About my money
I'm serious
You know I'm always on the grind
I'm serious
About my money
I'm serious
I'mma get money 'til I die

[Bridge: Park Ave.]
I really gotta have it
Cause my family, they gotta eat
And I can't live without it
Cause I know they depend on me

[Verse 3: E-40]
Thankin' the Lord for every moment that He let me breathe
Thankin' the Lord for all my friends and all my family
If it wasn't for You, it wouldn't be me, I know that's fa'sho'
You gon' have my back forever, even if I go broke

Even if I go broke, you know I move mean
I got get back skills, bounce back like a trampoline
Martin Luther had a dream in the 60's
No color line when it was black and white TV's

I'm grateful, I'm thankful, appreciate it, no doubt
Been in the game for a minute, got hella status and clout
I bought, it ain't rented, got me a mansion, a house
Soon as they get it, they spend it, that ain't the way I was taught

Put somethin' up for a rainy day, mama'nem use to say
They say life ain't promised tomorrow and life ain't promised today
Surround yourself with good people, good people hard to come by
Give 10 percent for your tithes, that's the good in God's eyes

[Chorus: Park Ave.]
I'm serious
About my money
I'm serious
You know I'm always on the grind
I'm serious
About my money
I'm serious
I'mma get this money 'til I die
