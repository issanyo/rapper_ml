Intro

Tez McClain, Skip, HBK, 40 Water..let's go

Tez McClain verse

Just touched down, 5 hour flight
Straight from the A, only for one night
That brown and that white
Got a nigga feelin right
So...uhh
Bend over
Show me what it hit like
Now where they at
Black bitches, white bitches
I don't discriminate at all, cause I like bitches
I mean Asians, Latins, even dike bitches
Hell we all the same when you hit them light switches
Now drop it low, real real low
The type of ass a lame nigga prolly kill fo
Furthermore make a trick spend a lil dough
Not me, put it in my bill fold...bitch
And peep game
Come fuck with a real nigga
They got drank, got purp, got pills in here
Slight work, wanna take it to the crib witcha
And I ain't tryin to chill witcha either bitch cause I'mma scoundrel

Chorus

Scoundrel, Scoundrel, Scoundrel
Scoundrel, Scoundrel, Scoundrel
Bitch Im a Scoundrel, Scoundrel, Scoundrel
Scoundrel, Scoundrel, Scoundrel
Listen I don't love these hoes
I love these dollars
I'mma beat it up and then holla
Lil momma I'mma Scoundrel
Scoundrel, Scoundrel
Bitch I'mma Scoundrel
Scoundrel, Scoundrel

HBK Skipper verse

Money over everything, only fearin wedding rings
Stackin all my dough up, from the floor up to the ceiling fan
Real niggas feel the flow, pretty bitches feel the pain
Sex em then eject em, no excuses or exceptions
I already learned my lesson from the last bitch
Hangin on my every word like a ad-lib
Hoes in the club, gettin turnt like a backflip
Took her home & did the same thing on my mattress
I can outta town you, but I ain't finna hound you
I ain't finna sweat ya, bitch im finna let ya
Skipper the professor finna teach ya ass a lesson
I ain't talkin bout no wrestlin when I say im finna stretch ya
I dont love hoes, thats against my code of ethics
But I still joyride the pussy till I wreck it
Real ass nigga, know I meant it if I said it
And its HBK, you know u gotta respect it, these hoes know Im a motherfuckin' scoundrel

E-40 verse

Let me talk to em playa
Fuck these hoes, fuck these niggas, fuck these bitches
I'll mow a buster down bout my fetti bout my riches
I'm a boss a fixture a factor I'm 40
She know me, she on me, want me, fuck these counterfeits they phony
But I'm not, I just look like this but I'll bust my Glock
Brodie wanna funk cause I knocked his trophy
Slakin on his mackin mane he got to cozy
(What you got)
I got a waaad in my pocket
But I'll smack your broad with it if she out of pocket
That's how we do it in The Bay
We carved from a whole nother clay
Scoundrel, throwed, recock recoil and unload
Be careful where ya headed
Cause they'll catch you gettin off the exit

Chorus

E-40 outro

Free all the real niggas mane
Free my nigga Earl Joseph mane
Ya understand me it's alot of niggas behind them walls mane
That don't really deserve to be there mane
Ya feel me
It's money out there mane, let's get it all mane
Ya understand me
Niggas is locked down keep your head up brother
Ya understand me stay strong
