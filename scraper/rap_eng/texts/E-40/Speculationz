Be where you wanna be, and you're doing what you wanna do

[E-40]
Mob that shit up, bee-yatch!!!

[Voice repeating]
Who cares what they think about you?

[Verse 1: Monoxide]
Peculation has it, that I'm the freakiest one
I like to rip out my tongue and spit the black magic
And I'm supposed to be fucking some crack addict without a rubber?
And I already got a baby by her mother?
They say I'm a sci-fi wizard of sorts
And my momma, she was a banshee
She was drowned by the courts
They say my little brother Jamie
He's dead and in a grave, and I'm all alone and afraid
And everything I gave has been so underestimated
I've been hated by generations
For having conversations with people who didn't make it
How could I fake it?
I'm a monster, remember me?
The weirdo with the axe, from another galaxy
I keep a blender in my kitchen filled to rim with the blood
And spit suspicions of me drinking it up
So it's fucked, scatter stones, get out my Kool-Aid
I'm blasting away from all you haters
Hit me up on my two-way

[Hook x4: Twiztid]
You start some bullshit fallin' down (Fallin' down)
I'm ok (I'm ok)

[Verse 2: Jamie Maddrox]
Speculation has it that I'm a drunk and a drug addict
A shit talker, always trying to start static
A borderline faggot, with long fingernails
Either that or he's a coke head, but I don't think he cares
Speculation has it that I have already engaged
In sexually fantasies with me and Gwen Stefani
A video taping, internet downloads
Speculations is called is the one who gets boned
I can't escape it, mistake it, or fake it out
Look you in the face as if I don't know what you talking about
Speculation, you heard that I don't spit on no bodies shit
But no, don't hate me
Many mouths to feed, and many personalities
In me looking to get P.A.I.D
Is it a lie or is it true?
You can put that on our skills they stay snug like my Batman suit

[Hook]

[Verse 3: E-40]
We smash the flash and if I have to blast it back, get 'em up, hit 'em up
Speculations, hater-ations, me and Twiztid don't give a fiz-nuck
Cause we gon' stay gettin' papered up, and stay smashin' indepently
With a dedicated ass fan base that'll do a motherfucker in for me
Speculations, but see they just don't know
I don't be rappin' too fast, they just be listenin' too slow
I don't be spittin' sluggish, E-40 Water be spittin' thug shit
40 be representin' the bowery up in the Compton, got the third hoppin'
Ain't no stoppin' a pimp, me walk with a limp
Elbows on gimp, puffin' on hits, sippin' on sip
Sippin' on sip, dippin' and skatin' and bouncin' and shit
Me and Twiztid be twisted, me and Twiztid be gone
Me and Twiztid be blizted, me and Twiztid be stoned
Gone on our head, dead, dead wrong
Smokin' turtle, beatin' on our chest like King Kong
Conversatin', lickin' and pokin', high powered slangin' of the day
Tryin' to persuade this liquor into giving me brain
