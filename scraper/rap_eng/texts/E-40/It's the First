[Hook]
Everybody ready with they work (With they work)
My hands fresh out a chick purse (Chick purse)
Got green, got white, got purp (Got purp)
Calling all D-boys to the turf (What is it?)
(it’s the first)
‘Bout my money, got the chick in a fit, like a bitch, I feel rich
(it’s the first)
‘Bout my money, got the chick in a fit, like a bitch I feel rich

[Verse 1: E-40]
It’s the first, mayne, and I’m on my grind
I get paid, but it’s already spent up in my mind
I been stacking my gouda to go to Maui (Hawaii)
Instead of buying, I’mma lease me an Audi (Go ‘head)
The big body Audi fresh off the showroom floor
Put it in my side chick, she got a good credit score (800)
Living above my means sometimes but that’s some nigga shit
Fuck it, B, I’mma buy some Jordans and a brand new fit
I got clients and patients patiently waiting up for me
To return in my truck so they can get more bang for they buck
You can find me on I-5 where I usually be often
Re-uppin’ and coppin’ from my plug that stay out in Compton
Bompton, smoking bubba kush
On my way to the Yay where they keep the K in the bush
Where the church people pray for they loved ones, killers, and crooks
Where the bitches hella thick like Harry Potter books
BIATCH!

[Verse 2: Turf Talk]
Yeah, I’m down to my last, end of the month
Six dollars left and I need me a blunt
Got a past due balance, yeah, cable costs
PG&E tryna cut me off
God love me but sometimes I can’t tell, mayne
Every second got me looking for the mailman
Said I wasn’t gon’ do it but I spent it all
Soon as I got it I was at the mall
I’mma get and I’mma keep blowin’ shit
‘Cause I feel like you muthafuckas owe us shit
Got food on my card, I’mma need some cash
Call my baby sister, I’mma sell her half
Then it’s dopeman, dopeman, pharmaceutal
Early on the block with a Cup o’ Noodle
It’s a machine, we got it poppin’
Get it from two or three niggas so nobody know what I’m coppin’
It’s the first

[Verse 3: Cousin Fik]
It was the night before the first, I had a fit laid out
Tricks getting paid so my bitch stayed out
I used to be broke but that shit played out
Can you calculate the profits from a brick laid out?
You need grapes? Come through, I got a zip weighed out
You ain’t got money for the good, I put a mid-grade out
Suckas hating on a player, niggas bitchmade now
If I ain’t got a strap I pull a switchblade out
Smoking blunts to the neck as I run through the set
I got fronts, took a left from a bunch of niggas in debt
Ridin’ in an old school but it runs like a ‘Vette
EBT on me, let’s do lunch in a jet
Side of work on the first, what I can’t be
We ain’t related but I still call her “auntie”
She say them niggas ‘round the corner do her janky
And my rocks be so fat she gotta thank me
Cousin
