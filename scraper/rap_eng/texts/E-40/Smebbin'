"You better watch me, I'm comin smebbin"
"Smebbin down the streets in my seven-oh"
"You better watch me, I'm comin smebbin
Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven"

I was smebbin through the park one day
"Smebbin down the streets in my seven-oh"
Smebbin through the park one day
"You better watch me, I'm comin smebbin"
I was smebbin through the park one day
"Pervin like a motherfucker, swervin"
Smebbin through the park one day
"You better watch me, I'm comin smebbin"

I was smebbin through the park one day
In the very very month of May
I seen three switchin bitches, that thought I had riches
Started walkin towards my way
Hangin out the sunroof of my Brougham Caddy-Mack
Ham sandwich with the BEEZ off in the back
I mah-uh-macked on one, but I slapped down two
Thoroughbred tenders like that, smashed out
Dabbed out, bust a pattern, leave em smokin
Just like Felix Mitchell and them used to do out there in Oakland
Major clout without a doubt like Clarence Carter I'll be strokin
Kick a bootch smooth up out my car if she get to actin like I ain't pokin

Smebbin through the park one day
"Smebbin down the streets in my seven-oh"
I was smebbin through the park one day
"You better watch me, I'm comin smebbin"
Smebbin through the park one day
"Pervin like a motherfucker, swervin"
I was smebbin through the park one day
"You better watch me, I'm comin smebbin"

Say ho, you got your E's mixed up
What the fuck you mackin for huh bitch? You got your E's mixed up
Always pitched a bitch, quality timer-ass bitch
You best to come and do, 'posed to be down with anything I do
Now first of all before you correct me
I was pretty much already an established celebrity
Get my keys zack me cash off
Keep up in the game so heavily
But youse a stubborn, why in the fuck you complain?
I raised your ass bitch, brought your ass out the rain
When you was in the red, without a roof overhead
I helped your ass out, by puttin you in my bed
Around this time last year your ass was in the dark
And bitch, I'm out -- headed to the park

Smebbin through the park one day
"Smebbin down the streets in my seven-oh"
Smebbin through the park one day
"Boy you better watch me, I'm comin smebbin"
I was smebbin through the park one day
"Pervin like a motherfucker, swervin"
I was smebbin through the park one day
"You better watch me, I'm comin smebbin"

Woke up in the morning on perculation
Hit the homies up, made reservation
What's crackin man, nigga what's cookin?
I got some hoes man, nigga good lookin
Walked out the house, ten thirty three
Dang near forgot my epinine milli-mi
It's unlawful for me to forget my pepper folks
Yeah all my reapers and stealers would like it
For me to forget my pepper
Even though y'all my peoples, off the record playboy
Where the alcohol and your broccoli at nigga I'm tryin to get my dick wet
Where the naked hoes? Where the big booty bitches? Yvettes and Susettes
I like em thick with the dookie mickers by their hand
Bow legged bitches with the bigger Gaps than the Band
Tell me a little bit about yourself bitch, tell me a little about your history
You done fucked around and made me mad, now I'msabout to talk bad
Tore up, ass, bitch, if you don't give me some head
You best to smeb -- bitch!
