[Intro: Levitti + (B-Legit sample)]
Mmm…yeah…
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Yeah…
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Can’t stop me now, can’t stop me, no, no
I’m headed for the top, down and dirty for my props
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Can’t stop me now, can’t stop me, no, no
I’m headed for the top, down and dirty for my props, yeah yeah
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Coming up in this game, you know it hasn’t been easy
You know it hasn’t been easy
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
I’m tired of being stepped on—can you feel me now?
Somebody say “Yeah”

[Verse 1: B-Legit]
Stress, I guess I got the D-boy blues
I gotta quit the game, I need something to do
Tried to get a job, didn’t have no skills
So I had to sell crack just to pay my bills
I stayed low-key and on the under
I never seen your face, then it made a brother wonder
Is it the police trying to trap me?
Or some fool who’s out to jack me?
I kept a gat, a strap of security
Shook all fools who really wasn’t sure of me
‘Cause I won’t slip or either sleep
I check you by the chin or the cheek
A brother got tired of taking this route
I asked the Lord if he could help me out
I got on my knees and admitted my sins
I need a way out for me and my friends

[Chorus: Levitti + (B-Legit sample)]
Can’t stop me now
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Can’t stop me, no, no
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
I’m headed for the top, down and dirty for my props
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Can’t stop me now, can’t stop me, no, no
I’m headed for the top, down and dirty for my props, yeah yeah

[Verse 2: E-40]
Success, I bet you could say it’s all good in some ways
But you can also guess, that it can cause up a whole bunch of mess
Between people that know of you and went to school wit’ ya
They can’t believe that you’s a fool with
Potent and dope and meaningful vow—boy, you got your own style
Type rap, that’ll make your head bob and clap
Much dap, to Tap Dat Ass, he got my back
(“Ain’t nobody gonna stop me”) Huh, yeah, huh
It’s gonna be a long road, that’s what I was told by some folks
We growed and growed over the years with high hopes
Me, E-40, D-Shot, Legit
Never had no ideal that we would become The Click
Now we got our own thing, sitting on top
You couldn’t stop this with a Mac and a Glock
Spittin’ that ol’ stuff that make these ol’ sucka bustas wanna knock us
But now they can’t stop us

[Chorus: Levitti + (B-Legit sample)]
Can’t stop me now
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Can’t stop me, no, no
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
I’m headed for the top, down and dirty for my props
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Can’t stop me now, can’t let them stop me, no, no
I’m headed for the top, down and dirty for my props, yeah yeah

[Interlude: B-Legit + E-40]
Yeah, man, fools always tryna put salt in a brotha’s PG, you feel me?
Yeah, I feel you, man
They don’t believe that a brotha can make it without sellin’ D, you know?
Yeah, but it’s like this though

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
I’ma keep droppin’ bombs, lettin’ loose
And when I’m through rappin’, I guess I’ll produce
And drop more dope on a track like these
20 years later, I still stack G’s

[Interlude: B-Legit + ”Stan”]
Uh, uh, excuse me, B-Legit, hi, Stan here
Uh, look here, great product, we could do big things together
Sew up the whole entire Bay Area
Come on, trust me, feel me, touch me
Fool, we nationwide, doin’ thangs, mayne, hahaha…

[Chorus: Levitti + (B-Legit sample)]
Can’t stop me now
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Can’t stop me, no, no
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
I’m headed for the top, down and dirty for my props
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Can’t stop me now, can’t let them stop me, no, no
I’m headed for the top, down and dirty for my props, yeah yeah
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
Coming up in this game, you know it hasn’t been easy
You know it hasn’t been easy
(“Ain’t nobody gon’ stop me, mayne”)
I’m tired of being stepped on—can you feel me now?
Somebody say “Yeah”
