I got big money, my pockets don’t jingle
Walk around the club, I drink and I mingle
Met a redbone, she get chips like Pringles
She pops that pussy for singles
Pop-pop-pops that pussy for singles (SINGLES)
Pop-pop-pops that pussy for singles (SINGLES)
Pop-pop-pops that pussy for singles (SINGLES)
Pop-pop-pops that pussy for singles (SINGLES)

[Verse 1: E-40]
She pops that pussy for singles
Moved to the South, but really from the Ingles
Booty like a couch, you could sit on it and mingle
Earring in her mouth, know all the latest lingo
Whoop you with the slick talk, dumb to a nigga
More game than a nigga, she make six figures
Cash (What she take?)
She take a spinning class
Her body bad
Keep up with the Joneses, got all the latest bags
Know how to twerk that thang to get what she want
Booty control, she got donk
Ride with a hustler, she a soldier
Keep a banger in her purse, fuck a holster
Used to drive a Nova, now a Rover
Grabbing her ankles and bending over…BIATCH!

[Hook]
I got big money, my pockets don’t jingle
Walk around the club, I drink and I mingle
Met a redbone, she get chips like Pringles
She pops that pussy for singles
Pop-pop-pops that pussy for singles (SINGLES)

[Verse 2:Too $hort]
I got a dollars in the VIP with some bitches and my potnas
And I don’t even make it drizzle
I ply a bunch of ones, give ‘em to my bitches
I tell ‘em ‘Give it to the strippers
Tip a little extra if she a pussy licker’
That make my dick get bigger
You already know, I’m a freaky ass nigga
Paid ass nigga, crazy ass nigga
OG nigga, she gon’ pay me if I get her
Scoop it up, give me all that money on the flo’
Bitch chose me, I don’t want another hoe
But if she go, I’mma get that and some mo’
Everything’s for sale, mostly pussy and coke
You see that shit? We get it daily, baby
You talkin’ about love, I’m saying ‘Pay me’

I got big money, my pockets don’t jingle

[Verse 3]
[E-40]
After a hard night at work, Erica
Wake up and head out to Bank America
The tellers wonder what she do and how she got it
‘Cause she drop off hella ones when she deposit
Rappers be wantin’ to fuck, but she don’t give it up (Unh-unh)
Just because she strip don’t mean she a slut
She got a man at home with a decent J-O-B
Work for PG&E, but on the side, sell tree

[Too $hort]
I’m ‘bout to change a few Benjamins
If that’s where the hoes at, I’m in it, man
I give back to the community
Tipping strippers ain’t new to me
I buy a bitch a drink and throw a few ones
While I’m all in her ear ‘Let’s do sum’n’
The way I do this shit is too fun
She break me off, and give the whole group some

[Hook]
I got big money, my pockets don’t jingle
Walk around the club, I drink and I mingle
Met a redbone, she get chips like Pringles
She pops that pussy for singles
