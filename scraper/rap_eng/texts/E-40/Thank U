[Chorus: Willy Will]
We drown ourselves in kush and Clicquot
We blocking out our inner ego
Lord, thank you for watching my people
Lord, thank you for keeping my people

I like Hazel; I like Cilantro
And I'm just trying to stack my nachos
Lord, thank you for watching muchachos
Lord, thank you for keeping muchachos

[Verse 1: E-40]
The weather for the day: dark clouds, hella gray
(Gray, gray, gray, gray)
Smokin' on some hay, plottin', lookin' for a play
(Play, play, play, play)
Even when I'm high, all day I pray
(Pray, pray, pray, pray)
Ain't about to let the devil come snake me
(Me, me, me, me)
If you stay ready, you ain't gotta get ready
(Ready, ready, ready, ready)
I can have you wocked for a favor or some fetti
(Fetti, fetti, fetti, fetti)
Curse like a pirate, drink like a sailor
(Sailor, sailor, sailor, sailor)
Everybody saying that I should run for Mayor
(Mayor, Mayor, Mayor, Mayor)
All street money, he ain't never seen a check
(Check, check, check, check)
Chicken one day, feathers the next
(Next, next, next, next)
It's 2017, no more big britches
(Britches, britches, britches, britches)
Stick to the script, don't burn no bridges
(Bridges, bridges, bridges, bridges)
Never back door or backstab your teacher
(Teacher, teacher, teacher, teacher)
Rule number one: Don't bite the hand that feed ya
(Feed ya, feed ya, feed ya, feed ya)
Solid, not potato salad since a young buck
(Buck, buck, buck, buck)
Play your position and you gon' get moved up

[Chorus: Willy Will]
We drown ourselves in kush and Clicquot
We blocking out our inner ego
Lord, thank you for watching my people
Lord, thank you for keeping my people

I like Hazel; I like Cilantro
And I'm just trying to stack my nachos
Lord, thank you for watching muchachos
Lord, thank you for keeping muchachos

[Verse 2: E-40]
Every day a movie, every day I go viral
(Viral, viral, viral, viral)
Drink in my cup, double-fisted with the Styro
(Styro, Styro, Styro, Styro)
I got the lowest prices, I'll give you some incentives
('Cenitives, 'cenitives, 'cenitives, 'cenitives)
First come, first serve, hurry up, it's time sensitive
(Sensitive, sensitive, sensitive, sensitive)
Corvette topless, pussy fallin' out my pockets
(Pockets, pockets, pockets, pockets)
Cocaine white, whip cream, white chocolate
(Chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate)
Pistol in my palm, I ain't scared to pop it
(Pop it, pop it, pop it, pop it)
A pro with the tools, I don't need no logic
(Logic, logic, logic, logic)
She don't wanna fuck me, she wanna fuck my bank
(Bank, bank, bank, bank)
She can give me brain if her mouth don't stink
(Stink, stink, stink, stink)
Watch who you with, don't be caught outta bounds
(Bounds, bounds, bounds, bounds)
Gotta be aware of your surroundings
('Roundings, 'roundings, 'roundings, 'roundings)
Smokin' on Khalif with a little bit of Keef
(Keef, Keef, Keef, Keef)
Rollin' up a leaf and I'm feelin' like a Chief
(Chief, Chief, Chief, Chief)
Cover up the vents, put a towel over the smoke detector
(Smoke detector, smoke detector, smoke detector, smoke detector)
Light an incense, gettin' higher than an elevator
(Elevator, elevator, elevator, elevator)

[Chorus: Willy Will]
We drown ourselves in kush and Clicquot
We blocking out our inner ego
Lord, thank you for watching my people
Lord, thank you for keeping my people

I like Hazel; I like Cilantro
And I'm just trying to stack my nachos
Lord, thank you for watching muchachos
Lord, thank you for keeping muchachos
