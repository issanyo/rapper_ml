[Hook: repeat 4X]
She say she love me, she - she say she love me
She - she say she love me but all we do now is fuck and fight

[E-40]
If I asked you to rob that bank with me, wouldja do it?
Wouldja do you time like Martha Stewart?
Wouldja bust a nine, wouldja go to bat?
Put your life on the line with me, hit the dope track?
Oooh - is you down, would you beat a bootch down?
If a pimp couldn't swim, would you let a pimp drown?
Wouldja, stop naggin me about last night? (Last night)
Two wrongs don't make no right (no right)
All we do is fuck and fight
Kiss and make up and lay up all night
Now bend over while I lay this pipe
While I beat the coochie to the broad daylight
She say she love me (love me)
But when I'm in the studio, she be gettin all ugly
(Gettin all ugly... she say she love me)
But I could give a fuck 'bout it cause I'm 'bout my money
Bendin co'ners, ridin jump off
Money long, like Mutumbo
Got that tweed, pushin peas
Frankenstein, 2-2-3's
I'm about my money (money)
Hangin out the window throwin up the Playboy bunny
Ain't never phony
I'mma keep it movin mayne cause I'm always hongry
Lil' momma what that is, tell me what'cha name
What it be, do you need a lil' Q.T.?
A lil' quality time, a lil' bumpin and grind
A lil' wine and dine, a lil' movie?
A lil' money sometime, a lil' Dolce Gabann'
A cherry Louis Vuitton, a lil' jewelry?
Why you mad, why you always take it out on me? (on me)
Why you always showin out in front of company? (company)

[8 Ball]
Mannnnnnnn, ain't never seen one look like you cutie
Dammmmmmmn, five foot two with a nice round booty
You are just my type, I can see it in yo' eyes
And I knew that from day one
Stayin up all night just chillin
Talkin 'bout what we gonna name my son
Twenty-fo' seven hustlin
The object is not to be broke again
Let me get yo' whole paycheck
One time when I couldn't pay the rent
Now look at your baby Benz
With the lil' TV and the crazy rims
Big rocks on your hand
Tell your friends big daddy bought them
Now, on the other hand
Here we go again, talkin 'bout "Where the fuck you been?"
Always, at the studio
In another time zone tryin to get rich
Get you for the Zinfandel
Fire up one, let you hit the green
Niggas mad, you on my team
Cause they know how you move them things
Come home, be a momma and a wife and a freak in the bed baby
I'm tryin to work
Why you gotta call me 100 times like you crazy?
Don't play, when the time is right
We can get up in the urr and go play
Wanna go dere, then stay hurr, and love me e'ryday

[Bun B]
Well there's a stranger in my house, in my bed
Fuckin up my life and my bread
Playin mind games all in my head
Sometimes I swear you worse than the feds
You love a nigga, then hate a nigga
Then you love me again man this shit's confusin
In the streets hittin licks I'm winnin
Comin home fuckin with you man I'm losin (I'm losin)
I'm built for drama but not this kind (this kind)
Let it slide befo' but not this time (this time)
This is the business in this here hustlin
You can't be fuckin up this grind (this grind)
Man you been doin too much campin (campin)
Bumpin your gums and yappin (yappin)
Interferin in grown folks business
And baby girl I just can't let that happen (happen)
I've been out here sweatin this blood
Fuckin with cutthroats to get this cake (this cake)
But I swear, it seems like the mo' I give ya
The more you try to take
My heart and my back you try to break
I ain't crazy I see the signs
Try to steal my light and my shine
You must be outta yo' fuckin mind (DAMN!)
I just wanted to spoil you
Well I guess I succeeded
But now you just too fuckin conceited
If this is love I don't need it
You actin like you the pimp and I'm the ho (HELL NO)
Man I swear to God if your pussy wasn't the bomb
I'da left yo' ass a long time ago
BITCH! {*echoes*}
