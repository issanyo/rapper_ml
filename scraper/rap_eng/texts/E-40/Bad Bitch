[Talking: E-40]
My nigga you see that shit?
Nigga that bitch thicker than... peanut butter in the freezer
Nigga I'm try'na have that that bitch mane
Well put'chu bid than
Nigga that right that bitch right that's a bad bitch
That's a bad bitch

[Hook: E-40]
That's a bad bitch mane that's a bad bitch
Nah that's a bad bitch mane that's a bad bitch
That's a bad bitch mane that's a bad bitch
That's a bad bitch mane that's a bad bitch
I just want to dig her out
Blow her coochie and back out
Show her what I'm all about
Bust a nut all in her mouth

[Verse 1: E-40]
Is she handling? Yeah she handling
Ass like a southern country girl from Grambling
She got yams, she got cakes
I'm try'na get mines off and check face
I'm not a trick I don't treat
I talk slick I use my mouth piece
My name good in the streets girl I'm a beast
Concrete from my head to my feet
Fat boy but I'm good in the sheets
Scorpio you better know it I'm a freak
Now drop that captain and come and get with this
I'm serious as a heart problem girl I ain't laughing
I met this afro American mix Hispanic ho
Puerto Rican chick love to cook and fungo
Dunk so big you could play the bongos
Got a drum roll booty thick juicy and jumbo
Damn

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Stressmatic]
I'm on the punk rock broad with a tat on her throat
She breaking down the swishers so I know that she smokes
She prolly does coke but I don't do coke
I'm old school babe like DiBiase on the ropes
Bitch I'm on like I'm so gone
Hoes tell they partnas TJ's the bomb
Bad ass bitch, tall and she's thick
When you're a rapper you can just pick
Look into they eyes that I fuck up they lives
All my lady friends are like the Basketball Wives
Pretty ass broads, nines and tens
I fuck her and all of her friends
Fresh out the store with some brand new gear
I just leave a couple shirts and tell the bitch I live here
Honest, I don't ever make a ho a promise
I'm signing off now, Thomas
Peace

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Droop-E]
Droop-E, that bitch is a problem
Pretty face from heaven but she hot like lava
Halle Berry waist, ass like shining
And she don't play games (no) head like Rihanna
I do it for the sport pull up in that new Porsche
Hatin' cause I got more hoes than a golf course
Droop-E, this shit ain't new to me (negative)
Coonary, she love me jewelry
Take her to the loft get boss no cost
I'm a Bay nigga baby, get with it or get lost
I been driving her crazy we can go round four
From the bed to the shower to the bed to the flo'
She say she a good girl but she seem so bad
Wanna introduce me to her mom and dad
Should I get married and let her into my chest
So just leave her dressed her white like a wedding dress
