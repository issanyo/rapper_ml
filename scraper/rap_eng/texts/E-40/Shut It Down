[Verse:]
Alright, alright, off we go smooth and mellow
I’m about to play MC’s like tecmo
Gettin ma props, it says E 40 ima ma drop that
Hmm they ain’t fo’ heathens so lemme buckle up an switch up Lanes
Be throbbin, knockin, tweezin, orange jellin
I got em wonderin if I’m workin or sellin
Yola white wit da dukey brown top
Lookin clean as I wanna be, killin em off stack on the mac tip
Gettin busy bout ma record shrine, hurtin suckaz dealins
Makin em wanna resign back to the drawin board, cause you know you outta line either or
The penalty’s not decline I was d score
I believe it’s a zipper the nathan, I dropped tha bomb
Cause it ain’t the season for flakin tweaked off ma tongue
Rolling them back's getting twisted an all, then I start ma clown you didn’t know
I shut it down

[Verse 2]
Like Satchel Paige I call my outfield in
Four counts bases loaded , anotha win for E 40 and the click crew
I thought you knew E.R.A. average is 00.2
Don’t need a pinch hitter cause I’m already on here about a thousand
That’s if you don’t forfeit
Don’t be mad at me though chock it up as a loss
I get saucier than Ragu spaghetti sauce
Proof is in the pudding, check your local listings for booking -me,the one an only unorthodox rapper E 40
Put here for a purpose, now tell me is it worth it ridin round startin up trouble in yo public
That ain’t even sharp at all, cause one day mom’s gonna get a call
Would-you,would-you,would-you come identify yo son
He’s anotha victim of a hot (hot one)


No I ain’t tryna knock nobody hustle but now this whole violent thang gotten way outta bounds
Innocent bystanders gettin shot up an carried off
Folks killin otha folks, chil’ren stealin from they parent, kidnappin, robbin, the whole blasé
What! you think that’s groovy? Mayne d whole world is corrupted
Check it out, partna, I know the streets ain’t goin nowhere
But now as far as we gatherin up dis information that I done learn through ma stressful strife
I wanna share wit ya’ll ya know what I’m sayin
But now look I care fo’ folks
I’m wanna shut this whole thang down on this whole violent thang
Killin up each otha mayne
We need to gone wit dat, shoot dat to da left, tear dat off
You know what I’m sayin, I’m sayin d same thang

[Verse 3]
I’m givin off velvet, an I’m proud to tell it
A young black entrepreneur that ain’t sellin it
Gettin ma props makin ma mil though
I rather be at home than jail bro
Motivation ma brotha, gets rid of frustration
Notice how I didn’t stutter
I neva would do naythin of that fashion
I go on a 2 day fastin, meditate on nothin but positive rappin
See I take it deep, wake up in d middle a ma sleep
Get on ma knees an pray an say ‘thank you Lord for wakin me up today’
That’s on d goosh ma pal, ima get say it anyhow
But now if yo stubborn, summin like dat may be outta yo league
Thinking to yo stuff they might call me all kinds a punks an stuff
Partna you ain’t down wid us no more, you soft-tear dat off
And shut it down
