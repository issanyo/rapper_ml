My neck and wrist be shinin in the sun
All big faces, ain’t none of these rude
Out here getting it in the California slum
Because ballin is fun

Protect yourself at all times, cause niggas be on bellucian and snort wild
Real life, not a movie, hard times
Gotta be aware, pay attention to your warning signs
That’s why I life live to the end, cause you never know when it’s gonn end
Eryday my birthday, don’t worry out what I spend
This hustler got, this hustler earned it
Monster, but my first name ain’t Herman
Came in the game with nothing, got out the game with something
Was traffic out there rushing, in the ghetto out there hustling
Stacking my chips, eating my bread, strapped with the lead
They want me dead
Knocking hoe, getting some head, on a ceiling mattress bed
Took a left over from my bundle after I copped and bought a drop
More and it’s fun, I bought it with 1’s, drove it off of the lot
Wind got me some slap, and wrapped in mat black
Tinted window front and back, Pontiac, in the 20 sack

Your life is hard, times are tough, looking for money, you can’t find enough
You try rapping, but nobody signed you up
Got some cocaine, try to grind and stuff
Went to jail, now your time is up
Can’t get it all together cause your mind is fucked
Mad at the world cause you ride the bus
Looking out the window, wanna ride like us
I’ma tell you something that’s good for your health
Never give up on yourself
You never know when it’s your turn to get rich
Brand new whip with a bad lil bitch
Hunned thousand dollars on your first car
Shit can really happen when you work hard
I’ma do it till I’m dead and gone, short dog, what you doing
I’m having hella fun

16 zippers in a one pound bag, 16 strippers getting down like that
Moving round like that, beaver doing great
I remember I was state pen ache for great
I remember how the stake and that vva
Just touched back down so I’m extra straight
Got a date with an asian she be register bar
On half down town, wanna fuck my car
I’m a real rap star, got the felony flow
Like I robed the baseline and fucked the melody slow
...you know, oh we gonn get right
Bitch listen to a pimp when he talking that shit
I keep the wood in the whip, kush in the swish
You never seen a black nigga ball like this
In every magazine I be all like this
With the 40k rollie on the wrist
