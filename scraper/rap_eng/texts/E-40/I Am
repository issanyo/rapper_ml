I see no, hear no evil
Black writing on the wall
Unleash one million faces
And one by one they fall!
Black-hearted evil
Brave-hearted hero
I am all, I am all I am
(I, I, I)
I am!
Here we go buddy, here we go buddy, here we go, here we go buddy
Here we go!
Go ahead and try to see through me
Do it if you dare
One step forward
Two steps back
I'm here!
(One step forwards two steps back)
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life!
Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free
I am all, I am all of me!(X4)
(Here we go...)
I see and feel the evil
My hands will crush them all
You think you have the answer
I laugh and watch you fall!
Black hearted evil
Brave hearted hero
I am all, I am all I am
(I, I, I)
I am!
Here we go buddy, here we go buddy, here we go, here we go buddy
Here we go!
Go ahead and try to see through me
Do it if you dare
One step forward
Two steps back
I'm here
(One step forwards two steps back!)
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free?
I am all, I am all of me!(X4)
(Here we go...)
I am, I am everyone, everywhere, anyhow, any way, any will, any
Day! (X2)
I am, I am, I am! (X2)
I am!
Do it, do it, do it, do it!
Can you see all of me?
Walk into my mystery
Step inside and hold on for dear life
Do you remember me?
Capture you or set you free?
I am all, I am all of me!(X4)
(Here we go, here go, here we go...)
I am, I am all of me...
