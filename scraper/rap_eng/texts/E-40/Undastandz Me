[Verse 1:]
My nigga I don't want no hands out I'ma get my shit regardless
My network in the relationship, game is flawless
Where I'ma stop, nobody knows, I'm all over the place with my flows
I've fucked around with the coca plant game for years but now I'm celibate
People always ask me 40 how you stay current and relevant
I'm cut from leather both of these cats is cut from polyester
I'm hard as a brick, most of these suckers soft, like feathers
Finnah knock me a chick, even better, break her for her cheddar
I'ma keep it all the way hood, I've been living in my third childhood, lately
Smoking a lot of spinach lately, hanging out at the strip club lately
I use to give them niggas player prices and jugs for the bricks
But now I be giving them discounts for hooks and verse licks
I like bitches with cellulite
I dont like them too lean
I like them thick and yolked like UCLA softball team
I'm cool with either or fat or petite
Cause I ain't gon' lie, skinny pussy be deep
Must open the package and throw the trojan out and smash it
Stretch the kiznoochie out just like elastic
I'ma give it to her slow like a snail or real fast like a rabbit
And in the bay area fly coonin' is a habit

[Hook:]
You Undastandz Me
Understand Me
You Understandz Me (x4)


[Verse 2:]
You got a zip?
I got a zip, you need a zip?
Yup!
You got a brick?
I got a brick, you need a brick?
Nope
That's what the little homey asked, when he was broke
Said he needed a credit line
I told that nigga ain't nobody giving out no lines
No numbers, no loans
Ain't nobody giving up zones, no chickens, no bones
Said his moms was about to lose her home, his sister on dialysis
Older brother didn't caught a body
His younger brother on Kaddafi
His daddy in for armed robbery, uncle in for grand larceny
His auntie in for bad checks; credit cards and money laundering
His cousin FISH, so he thinks he needs protection
Not only that, but his broad hollering pregnant
Quite as kept; she's been doing a lot of sexing
Getting it in, with the nigga best-friend
So I pushed him in the mix, with a month in a half, or 6 weeks or so
He moved up to 36
36 zips of bow equals a grip
We call it; Kicks, in the Bay
It's a fool, it's a trip, walk straight, they don't play, it ain't cool
BITCH!
[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
I'm a street nigga, walk with my head up, stick out my chest
I don't like private jets, I fly south west
And you'll never catch me wearing a fucking wire
That's how you get your head deflated like a tire
I don't be gossiping, and running off into lip and name dropping
I be hustling in the traffic, repping shoulders and hold down
Getting gusty and galavaty, politicing and moon walking
Desert eagle, hold a slick caution, verified ficture from the V
Soil celebrity, heavy, so don't be fucking with me
I'm having my fanny born and ready ever since I came out the coochie
I was a nosey little mustache infactuated with cash
Tryna get some ass fast, finger fucking broads in class
I get dressed at the mall, brand new kicks and fits
'Where you be getting yo hats from?' Man I buy them from Lidz
I'm with the shit but I don't really sucker shit that
Ya so fake type, that I'm on some real type like bernard
