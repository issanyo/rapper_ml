[Verse 1: E-40]
Make your next move your best move
That’s what I was tryin’ to explain to my little dude
Stick to the rules
God take care of babies and fools
And you ain’t a baby or a fool
Therefore, you ain’t got no excuse
Better get it together now, my little nigga
I know some bitches that’ll kill ya
He looked at me and said, *smick*
“I got a rife with a hundred round *clip*
And I’ll bust it if I got to, back me up in a corner
On Granny, nigga, somebody gon’ call a coroner
BIATCH!

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Livin’ po’ really got a nigga stressin’
Runnin’ from the boys, got a .40 for protection
My nigga just beat his case, they be testin’
Really outside, nigga…life lessons
Livin’ po’ really got a nigga stressin’
Runnin’ from the boys, got a .40 for protection
My nigga just beat his case, they be testin’
Really outside, nigga…life lessons

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
I was told two wrongs don’t make a right
And doin’ right never being wrong
To get along, we gon’ have to fight
What don’t kill ya gon’ make you strong
Little nigga on a Motocross
Big bruh got a 6 too
Bitch niggas you gon’ come across
Keep ‘em 50 feet away from you
Can’t tell ‘em what you don’t know
Never keep the dough where you grow the dro
If they ask, tell ‘em you don’t know
Remember, never talk to po-po
Keep friends with the enemies
Don’t believe ‘em when it’s 10 a ki
No Santa, no chimney
Follow God if you follow me

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Livin’ po’ really got a nigga stressin’
Runnin’ from the boys, got a .40 for protection
My nigga just beat his case, they be testin’
Really outside, nigga…life lessons
Livin’ po’ really got a nigga stressin’
Runnin’ from the boys, got a .40 for protection
My nigga just beat his case, they be testin’
Really outside, nigga…life lessons

[Verse 3: E-40 + B-Legit]
Ugh! When I was young, I used to ask hella questions
Always listened to my OG’s, they taught me life lessons
Do unto others as they do unto you
That’s what they told your little nephew
‘Cause karma’ll come back and haunt you
A hitta come out the blue outta nowhere, you’re dead
Fonkin’ with too many niggas that put some bread on your head
All you got is your word and your name, respect it and honor it
Protect it, my nigga, don’t let no bitch nigga tarnish it
We in a Thunderbird, listen to Parliament
Lemon tree ain’t shit, taste retarded
I don’t talk it, I beez a part of it
Trappin’ in the hood, nigga, right in the heart of it
If consequences make your decision
You end up dead, or off in prison
I walk it, man, but they don’t listen
Lessons in life, playing my position

[Chorus: Stresmatic]
Livin’ po’ really got a nigga stressin’
Runnin’ from the boys, got a .40 for protection
My nigga just beat his case, they be testin’
Really outside, nigga…life lessons
Livin’ po’ really got a nigga stressin’
Runnin’ from the boys, got a .40 for protection
My nigga just beat his case, they be testin’
Really outside, nigga…life lessons
