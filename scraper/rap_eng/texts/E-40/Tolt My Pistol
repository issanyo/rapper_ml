[Verse 1: Turf Talk]
I’ma bust one and get rid of that ho
Got a .40 on me with a cinnamon roll
Got a 4-5, lemon squeeze
Boom, too, 23’s
AK, banana clip
On some Tony Montana shit
Rude bwoy, bloodclot
Bust a nigga in his snot box
Got a Dillinger that’ll hold the shell
No evidence for the po-pells
And the big thang, I only pull it out
When they talk tough and start runnin’ they mouth
Gotta call for the boss when we get them niggas
Be patient and hit them niggas
Fatigued up, camo
Drrrrrrrrrrr…Rambo!

[Chorus]
That’s why I tolt my pistol
Everywhere I go, ‘cause you never know
That’s why I tote my pistol
Everywhere I go, ‘cause you never know

[Verse 2: E-40]
Dim your lights with my light dimmer
(What kind of dimmer?) 911 Kimber
Fuck with me and get scalped (get scalped)
I’d rather be caught with than without (than without)
They starvin’, they thirsty ‘cause it’s a drought (it’s a drought)
They say they gon’ hurt me and take me out (take me out)
Heavy metal (heavy metal) what I’m carryin’ (what I’m carryin’)
He had his daughter with him, so I spared him
You goin’ to hell or you goin’ to heaven?
My favorite weapon: FN57
Say your blessing, call the reverend
In a couple of seconds, I’ma teach your ass a lesson
I’m a boy—girl, I got gouda
I’ll have your head like Medusa
Don’t bother me, I won’t bother you
How many good dudes left? Only a few

[Chorus]
That’s why I tolt my pistol
Everywhere I go, ‘cause you never know
That’s why I tote my pistol
Everywhere I go, ‘cause you never know

[Verse 3: Turf Talk]
Long rifle with the scope on it
Grab it, cock it, and choke on it
Pistol-grip pump, boy
AP9 for a punk boy
.357 with the snub-nose
Machine gun with the air hole
Go to school with it, go to work with it
Lord knows a nigga sittin’ in the church with it
Potato head, no noise
Two guns, I’m a cowboy
Bounty hunter, we lookin’ for ya
Seen your chain, and took it from ya
One shot, Billy the Kid
Al Capone on some gangsta shit
Desert Eagle, player hater
I’ll be back—Terminator

[Chorus]
That’s why I tolt my pistol
Everywhere I go, ‘cause you never know
That’s why I tote my pistol
Everywhere I go, ‘cause you never know
