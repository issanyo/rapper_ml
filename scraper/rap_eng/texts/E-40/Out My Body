[Verse 1]
[E-40]
Tennessee Toddy, I went out my body
Had a little too much to drink Almighty
God can you show me some leeway
I'm seein' twos on the muthafuckin fr, a freeway

[B-Legit]
I'm coming out the gate crooked and I'm finna lose it
Got the tech and my deck and some mobb music
Hit the strip tryna catch me a twenty-deuce
Drinking Bombay mixin' it with orange juice

[E-40]
Twas the night before my rad had to turn himself in
Vallejo's Most Wanted violation and he's looking at ten
So we gon' live it up and act bad, boss
And party 'til the muthafuckin wheels fall off

[B-Legit]
Hope those wheels ain't made of stone
Five in the mornin' and I still ain't home
Man, I'm tore like never before
On the couch assed out with my eyes on low

[E-40]
Tonight we gon' smoke...
Burrito-size Taylors, Cerwin Vega's
Like to drink beer with mashed potatoes

[B-Legit]
Steak and chicken, eggs and grits
Clicked out shit makes platinum hits

[Chorus: E-40]
I don't really know why niggas game be gone way out
My body, way out, my body
I don't really care if the popo stop and stare
I'm way out, my body, way out, my body

[Verse 2]
[E-40]
Ay, B
I heard the yock went quack, zob schilacked
Multi-orgasms and the bitch collapsed

[B-Legit]
From the back I bash all night I last
When I grab that ass long dick and dash

[E-40]
A ruh uh, ran up on her, from Tacoma
Man, that bootch had miles on her

[B-Legit]
Fuckin wit a pimp bitch you ain't heard
You can start me in the mornin' with a bottle of 'bird
Lick on the hip and watch the dickhead rise
Up under your legs, in between your thighs

[E-40]
Long range pimpin, LRPs
No high jeans, no ticks and fleas

[B-Legit]
Wake me in the morning 'cause at night I snores
Alcohol comin' all out my pores
Four-door drivin' and I'm fast asleep
Bitch next to me in the passenger seat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
[E-40]
Certified top hat, one of the truest
Timin' like my niggas up in East St. Louis

[B-Legit]
Jack be Daniels, Jack be swift
My niggas in the H-Town smoke the spliffs

[E-40]
Juice and vodka, the tower of power
A plate of hot wings and some whiskey sour

[B-Legit]
I don't stop perkin', keeps it goin'
A full house in my dank room blowin'

[E-40]
Nigga disrespect, don't let it slide
Go get your entourage, fool, time to ride

[B-Legit]
I spots red lights and I'm loose and lit
Open bottle and a gat in my glove compartment

[E-40]
Alcohol, tobacco, and firearms
But this time, mayne, it's a false alarm
I really wish I took another route
But I'm gone out my body way out

[Chorus]
