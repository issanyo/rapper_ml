[Intro]
Turn my music up, turn my music up
My shit bang, my shit bang
My shit bang, my-my shit bang
Nigga my shit bang, bang, bang, bang

[Verse One]
My shit bang, my shit throb
I'm a motherfucking beast, I'm a motherfucking hog
Pull up with the slump
Or should I say black truck sounding like I got a alligator in the back
Paint wetter than melted ice, ralley and hockey stripes
Burning rubber at every light, mean mugging like 'thug ya life'
I be hustling all day and night, pushing all night and day
Twisted and whipping, yay, getting my Goapele
So you put my Gouda my pay, when I get in my way
From da Bay to L.A. to the A this nigga connected
Worldwide nigga this mister how-you-be-headed
You ain't gotta like me but you gotta respect it
Woke up early in the morning and put one in the air
Got so high thought about running for mayor
Slap myself to make sure I was still there
Shit, showered and shaving then I cut my hair
Today I'm try'na get laid then put a pounding on the mug
Try'na find me a bitch with a ass like a Worldstahiphop bunny
Try'na get rich in this collectings stack my money
You can tell that I'm a D-boy by my baller tummy
Sometimes I dress uppity, sometimes I dress scummy
Sometimes I dress high class, sometimes I dress bummy
If it ain't about no cash you can miss me
Most of the time you can find a hustla tipsy
Biatch, Biatch!

[Hook]
Turn my music up, turn my music up
Turn my-turn my music up, turn my music up (TURN IT UP!)
My shit bang, my shit bang
My-my shit bang, my-my shit
Bang-bang-bang, my shit bang
Nigga my shit bang, my shit bang
Nigga my shit bang, bang, bang, bang

[Verse Two]
Uhh! I been running around all day try'na get my decimals up (Up)
Anybody that try to stop me I suggest that they duck
Cause when I get the bucket I can assure you it's nothing pleasant
My arsenal game is east but the west has all kinda of relatives
Even if you're wearing chest protection a trauma plate won't work
Cause I'm a aim at your hammit, I ain't goin aim at you shirt
Alot of these bitch ass niggas should be wearing a skirt
With the box of Motrin and some maxi pads in they purse
Pillow talking and biting pillows, acting like some brizzles
Cause they're a whole bunch of that sucka shit a bunch of popsicles
I should of been a taurus cause I'm stubborn as a bull
I'm a different type of dude and I stick to the rules
I'm a real nigga best believe it, I live it and I breathe it
I tell it like it is and I call it how I see it
My potna used to be all sharp but now he on thee thee
'What do thee thee mean? ' Methamphetamine
I can't believe it, man you disappointed me
I'm devastated mayne he lost cool points with me
I'm standing outside of my crib with some gym shorts and a hoody
Talking to my nig on the celly smoking a philly
Sipping on a fifth of that oil cognac henny
A hundred wall on them bricks, he got caught with a key of candies
If you didn't go to jail by now he probably be dead
So instead he in there with his uncle his daddy and relatives
Uhh!

[Hook]
Turn my music up, turn my music up

Bang-bang-bang, my shit bang

Nigga my shit bang, bang, bang, bang
