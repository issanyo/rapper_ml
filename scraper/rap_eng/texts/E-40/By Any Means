[Intro:]
Ugh
Stick with it hahaha
Yea what you in

[Chorus:]
Black chevy on 23s
I’m through the hood with b and a 2-2-3 under the seat
Am like you ain't gotta worry bout me
Worry bout me [x2]
Am like you ain't gotta worry bout me
Worry bout me [x2]
Am like you ain't gotta worry bout me

[Verse 1:]
Can’t be draggin my feet and cattin off gotta be prepared at all times
Cause in magnum central and the bay they’ll pop you in ya spine
And california is hella hectic tips get sent, intercepted and redirected
Can’t be running around this motherfucker loose as a goose
They’ll turn you to a vegetable like the soup
Now i don’t condone busting a suckas dome
But if he plottin on my dome goin get his dome blown bitch
If there’s money being generated i want part of it
Keep a low profile stay low key won’t get targeted
Neva my multiplications, splitting the block and it’s booming
And if i get ever get popped or pined it’s a family reunion
I be in that bitch shootin constant sayin I miss you
Makin dice outta water and toilet tissue
Drinking cadillacs, coco and coffee prunos
Playin dominoes, chess and peanuts
Bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
My nigga 40 hit me up and say he need a favor
Ain't nothing sweet man, now or later
He said some niggas playin games in the bay man
Keep ya pay man just tell me where he stay man
He told me 7s on the real me and this nigga close
And then he told me a little moe i said he got to go
Fuck with my daughta and so know you just goin have to be
Another victim of a unsolved mysteries
Caught a flight that morning and flew back the same night
Caught the sucka eating suppa blew his brain right
Up out his head he gotta be dead now the kids cryin nigga mama probably be scared
Everybody pointing finga  they don’t even know
I turned that bitch into a ghost i move off the coast
I smoke like a roast get ya ass toast
And I be ridin' dirty from the east to the west coast

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Raw, raw hussle my nigga that’s how i do it
Real niggas get to the money and run through it
Bitch i’m the shit like a sewage i get it and do it movin
Fast lane nigga i don’t do the cruzin
Fast life let these bitches do the choosing
I’m using all my knowledge and steady stackin my profit
Once you get around these bitches you see that we main the topic
You hatin and niggas poppin we grindin and neva shopping
Niggas still selling dope shell rockin
I come from a corner where they still clockin
Ready rockin hit the avenue and get it poppin
Plus anywhere i go i got that wack a flocka
Plocka placka now that’s what i call a show stoppa
Amma get it by any means necessary
Nigga I ain't neva waited on the tooth fairy (x2)

[Chorus]
