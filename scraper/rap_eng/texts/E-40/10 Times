[Intro]
Colder than a motherf-
Colder than a motherf-
It's Guwop
Gangsta Gibbs, baby
Colder than a motherf-
Colder than a motherf-
Colder than a motherfuckin...

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Baby are you still down
Still Down for me
Still down to take a brick
Out of town for me
Rippin off the whole clip
Thirty rounds for me
See them niggas runnin' up
Now lay it down for me
Foreign cars for all solid broads that I know
I drive through and slide all these bum bitches McDonalds
I'm bustin down a pack of that boy-boy in Chicago
You make it to a brick in my hood and you hit the lotto
I hit the lotto
Like Powerball on a ho
Finna make a money shower fall on a ho
Smokin at the Trump Tower, bout to call a ho
Nigga finna make a money shower fall on a ho
10 times out of 10, she's a 10
And I wanna hit a 10 out of 10
Her boyfriend is a fuck nigga
Fuck with Gangsta Gibbs in the city, get you touched nigga
Number one pick, Big Dog on the Bucks nigga

[Hook]
10 times out of 10 she's a 10 and I want to fuck her friends
10 times out of 10 she's a 10 and I want to fuck her friends
Baby are you still down, still down for me
Baby are you still down, still down for me
Baby are you still down, still down for me

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Lookin at her and she's lookin at me
When I walk past the bitch she probably felt a light breeze
Her at the Heat game, check the feet game
And I bet she start cryin' if she ever don't meet
But she'll never ever ever find another like me
Stop thinkin' bout yourself gotta think about the team
Like Hakeem on the Dream
Yeah, Olajuwon bitch, throw a lot of ones bitch
Have a lot of fun bitch
[?] my girl and my bodyguard bitch
Your main chick fascinated by my body art trick
10 Times out of 10 she's a 10
In the Benz got twins in the Bentley
And I want to fuck her friends
(?) for I lend it to you baby
I don't call, when I call give it to me baby
Three or fourway, I'mma sin for my lady
And if I'm ever in the jail better send me something baby

[Hook]
10 times out of 10 she's a 10 and I want to fuck her friends
10 times out of 10 she's a 10 and I want to fuck her friends
Baby are you still down, still down for me
Baby are you still down, still down for me
Baby are you still down, still down for me

[Verse 3: E-40]
Lifestyle Ribbed
That's what I'm gonna use when I stick it
She bad, she fast
She gon' get a ticket
Thicker than a buttermilk biscuit
Down for the get down
Want a real nigga, fuck a clown
When he pound, she don't even make a sound
When I pound, I'mma leave it sore
Make her pussy clap like an encore
Ask the people next door
She got a gap that's out of hand, and this her favorite song
There's something about a broad that like to suck her thumb
She on my shoes like a piece of gum
(What she know you not?)
She know I'm not the two, I'm the one

[Hook]
10 times out of 10 she's a 10 and I want to fuck her friends
10 times out of 10 she's a 10 and I want to fuck her friends
Baby are you still down, still down for me
Baby are you still down, still down for me
Baby are you still down, still down for me
