[Hook: E-40]
What we really need to do is put that ho on the track man
(any batch, superbad, any batch, smell that?)
What we really need to do is put that ho on the track man

[E-40]

Broke and reckless eyeballin, fuckin around with Charlie Hustle main
It's in my spine (it's in my spine)
And what's deeply and hella obvious that what the broad think
Is her business, must be mine

Dude I cain't play a fool, potnah I'm a solid nigga dig this (dig that)
Suspension (suspension)
Bitch got to pay me ho, or pay me no attention!

[Hook]

[B-Legit]
Pay attention, this one with extension, big boots with the gloves
Seems she's lookin for love
Spent a dub at the bar with her, see I promised not to hit her
Long as I can get her
To the floor fashion show, short skirt and high heels
So the ass can show, satisfaction
Action make her ask for mo', gettin dough
Don't need no ho that's po', you know?
You'd rather blow fo' with the snowbunny, well I ain't mad
Cause the ho money mo' money, sweet as snow money
Bring it to a pimp so he maintain wealth
Forty G's on the yacht, I got cock for sale
Might bail to Miami, nine hoes deep
Red Bull and my bad hoes get no sleep
Gators on my feet, I talk shit you know
On how everything here is a ho

[Hook]

[E-40]
Beeyatch!

[Outro]
Smell, smell, Char-lie
Smell, smell, smell me
Smell, smell, the cheezie
Smell, smell, smell away
You can't make a tramp a champ even if you put her on a stamp
That bitch still wouldn't be worth a cryin dime
A blue nickel, or a screamin quarter
40-Water put it in order
Bitch it's about CB&H and I ain't talkin about pure cane sugar
I'm talkin about cock a butt and HEAD
Cock, butt, and head
Cock, butt, and head
Cock, butt, and head
Cock, butt, and head
(Beeyatch!)

[Roger Troutman voice]
What you need to do is put that ho on the track baby
Right now, or let me borrow that broad
Let me borrow that batch
Let me borrow that bootch
Let me borrow that ho
