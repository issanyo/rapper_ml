[Chorus: Problem & E-40]
Uhh, tell the bitch back it back
Fuckin' in the car, you can't come to the pad, woo
Tell that bitch just relax
Deep dick so good, bitch, I might charge a tax, woo
Park the coupes back to back
30 in this clip, put your head in your lap, ooh
So broke boy, relax, only speaking facts, bruh, relax, I'm out
Wah, relax, bitch, relax, wah, bitch
Broke boy, relax, only speaking facts, bruh, relax, I'm out
What

[Verse 1: Problem]
Errytime you see me, I be on something
Hit your slut, bust my nut then I be gone
Triple phone, if I don't answer, bruh, we workin'
Neck on McFlurry [?]
Gold Laker jersey, pushin' to Vallejo
A bitch is a good and they bad, Cain and Abel
All about my bangles, only bosses at my table, champ
She only fuck me 'cause I'm up and I'm OK with that

[Chorus: Problem & E-40]
Tell the bitch back it back
Fuckin' in the car, you can't come to the pad, woo
Tell that bitch just relax
Deep dick so good, bitch, I might charge a tax, woo
Park the coupes back to back
30 in this clip, put your head in your lap, ooh
So broke boy, relax, only speaking facts, bruh, relax, I'm out
Wah, relax, bitch, relax, wah, bitch
Broke boy, relax, only speaking facts, bruh, relax, I'm out

[Verse 2: E-40]
Rule of thumb, never leave your crib without your gun
Back a sucker up with the drum
Whip out on him with the cinnabon
Let that bitch know you ain't the one
Affirmative action, nah bitch, affirmative mackin'
Stay young from packing a yistol, I fry your head like a pickle
For being fraudul' and fickle and pillow talking to brizzles
I want the quick dollar, hoe bitch, I don't want the slow fucking nickels
Never reveal your enforcers, make them think that you're nervous
Not knowing you're active duty, more guns than the service
Real life's not a movie, don't be no clown in a circus
His bitch is a cutie, she want me all in her cervix
I told her I'm tooken but she insist that I'm not
I told her I'm married, she said she just wanna watch
My car painted cherry, got candy paint on my box
I've been drinking too heavy, I probably need to detox (BIATCH!)

[Chorus: Problem & E-40]
Tell the bitch back it back
Fuckin' in the car, you can't come to the pad, woo
Tell that bitch just relax
Deep dick so good, bitch, I might charge a tax, woo
Park the coupes back to back
30 in this clip, put your head in your lap, ooh
So broke boy, relax, only speaking facts, bruh, relax, I'm out
Wah, relax, bitch, relax, wah, bitch
Broke boy, relax, only speaking facts, bruh, relax, I'm out
What
