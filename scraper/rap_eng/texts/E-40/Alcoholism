[Chorus][x8]
Alcoholism

[Verse 1: E-40]
Pull this bitch over my nigga, I gotta piss
I stay with some sip in my fist, I drink like a fish
Sometimes I be sober, but most the times I be blitzed
I'm having my Gouda, my nigga all on her bitch
We ball like we hoopers, my nigga we hood-rich
We winning not losing, my fella we got chips
I keep me a stapler, a pistol-grip four-fifth
Cuz I'd rather be judged by 12 then to be carried by 6
Don't wanna be carried by 6, I Rather be judged by 12
Suckas be all in my mix, Cuz I be up in their gal
Don't know how to read, write and spell
But I can add and count scrill
I can sell a rocks to a cliff
I can sell oil to a well
Yay area reppin, don't need no swagger injection
Big Oceans Eleven, hustling and money collecting
I'm shattered, I'm blended mayne, I been chiefing the seven
The po po's they tripping mane, they sobriety checking

[Chorus][x16]

[Verse 2: E-40]
The fur furs is crazy, Lucky I have me a "desi"
A designated driver, a rider, we in it heavy
We knocking 40 Water, he foolish the boy gone
That's all they played was his music when I was in a group home
Bout to go slap some bones, shoot some dominoes with my fellas
Get on that Patron, called Stella Ella and Della
10 to get on the board, I'm fresh off the top
If I skunk you my ninja, you gotta drink two shots
Or we can play for some fedi, or we can play for pushups
Or we can put on the gloves, go from the shoulders box
After that we can hug get a room get props
All my fellas is thugs, ballheads dreadlocks
Slide out to the function, and continue to get bent
Last weekend it was smacking, my nigga that shit went
I left outta there with not one but two women
I guess you can blame it mayne on that alcoholism

[Chorus][x16]

[Verse 3: B-LEGIT]
13-hundred block ready rock animal
Sitting in the coupe, Orange like cantaloupe, something on the manifold
Gears in the rear, Olde English beer make it hard to steer
I been getting fucked up since the 9th-10 grade
Bird and grape Kool-Aid no ace of spades
I swerved and I do thangs I dance in the rain
And I guess this the money we gain the champagne
I pulls in the lot, bullets in the Glock
Hot boy or not B-lit like to shoot shots
Stop where I'm hot and I like to drink shots
And I'm gone off the Julio at the 20th what not
You can say what you say, Imma paper boy
Little waves up top, with the table boy
She be playing hard to get, but you can make them boy
Put some drink in her cup and watch her swish it up

[Chorus][x16]

[Outro]
Please drink responsibly don't drink and drive
