[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]
Okay, yeah, yo yo
Son I walk down the block like it's '76
Pimp robe, fur hat just to match my kicks
And my chain's like 80 pounds of frozen ice
I got four bitches with me, no need to look twice
Throw rice at my feet, rose petals, Malaysian salt
I smoked two Cuban cigars and a Newport
An ounce of the blueberry, big bottle of Tito's
Count the plaques on the wall, like I sang for The Beatles
Went from label to label, changed my name to Clark Gabel
Tony Starkaroni probably fucked your aunt Mabel
In the stash house owned by El Patr√≥n
Big friends in high places, always flyin' outta zones
Big banks in Sweden, vaults in Morocco
But my all time favorite is a Columbian taco

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street
If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Original, a lot of style, boom-pow
Blowin' on the pound, puh-puh-puh-puh-pow
Way up in the cloud
Misbehave the flav', now let me show you how
To maintain and sustain as I crush game
Smooth as silk with a little bit of Kush, mane
Plush game, lavish livin'
Bust on the pigs with bad intentions
Smoke dope, go for broke, young loc
The homie said 9-1-1 is a joke (Fuck tha police!)
And I believe that so I protect and serve
Every nigga on the block, that's my word
Cadillac drivin', stackin', providin'
Listen to the sounds of the sirens
I'm a O.G. nigga on a mission
Beans don't burn in the kitchen if you twist it while dippin' it

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street
If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street

[Verse 3: E-40]
Guard at the gate, live in a mansion
Rap career longer than an extension
Still hold it in court
Got my wine in the World Report
Or should I say the duPont REGISTRY?
If it ain't now, it will be
Grew up on purple, went from humble
Be bumpin' a bubble truck full of rumble
In a major way, E-40 cookin' out the double
Pot in the kitchen at all times
I'm a boss, still write my own rhymes
Been there, done it, been factor, trapper 'fore rapper
Been 100 from day one, quick thinker, fast reactor
Been a fixture, I don't think it's many left
Been the shit like your baby mama breath
Been in it for a while, been a threat
Custom houses and cars is how I'm livin'

[Chorus: Ghostface Killah]
If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street
If I walk the walk, talk the talk, sling therapy
If I spit what I knew then the courts would burn me
Feds'll lock me up and throw away the key
But my word is bond, that's the code of the street

[Verse 4: Tricky]
Music veteran, muscle and venom, and
The sole feature, ladies and gentlemen
Try to prepare, but I don't really care about
Locked in a cage, never gonna let you out
Think of an issue, write it on a tissue
When you're gone, nobody miss you
Years, shiftin' gears and add some tears
What's on your head about? I don't sell it out
I'm not gon' leave you there, but I don't really care
Rotten crest, Christmas is the worst
U.K., Jamaica, my family's from Jamaica
Spendin' time and maybe I can take you
I'd like to take you there, 'cause I really care
Like to take you, spare, take you there
Take you there, take you there
Take you there
