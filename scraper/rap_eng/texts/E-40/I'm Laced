[Verse 1: E-40]
He really a gangsta but they thought he was square as a box of apple jacks
He was getting his money from them but then he had a couple of setbacks
But he's still a celebrity with bounce back skills and ability
Raised by O.G.'s that been in a correctional facility
The thing about this new generation, they hella quick to bust they guns
Without thinking about the repercussions they relatives and loved ones
I can look a fool in his pupils and just tell what he about
By analyzing his hand-gestures and what come out his mouth
That come from being from it, experienced and seasoned
From hustling monday through friday, clubbing and going to church on weekends
That's why I had-pick my friends, never know what they'd do
Trust no human, just G-O-D and you

I stay looking at my rear view
I stay looking over my shoulder
Never know who want me out here
Never know who want me over
I can tell tall timber from tiny brush
I know the difference between a cabbage and the lettuce (bitch!)

[Hook: Cousin Fik & E-40]
Pull up a chair, and get you a taste
Of the sun-caked game, no chase (Motherfucker, I'm laced)
I ain't never been fake
Everything I said about you I say it to your face (I'm laced)
On eights, looking like skates
I never been late, learned the game from the grace (Nigga, I'm laced)
Stay in your place, and don't hate
Cause fucking with me ain't safe (Unh!)

[Verse 2: E-40]
If you can't cook stay out the kitchen, if you can't swim get out the ocean
Don't hop in the yola game if you're soft as Jergens Lotion
Believe half of what you see, and none of what you hear
Analyze that fool before you let him get in your ear
Sleep with one eye open, and one eye closed
In case the thirsty and dusty try to kick in your door
Never tell a homey how you make love to your woman
Cause he might be the same homey who wanna fuck your woman
There's three sides to every story, there's mine's, your, and the truth
Niggas loose they lives every day over a booch
You can fuck around and get stamped, fucking around with a tramp
Running around here loose without no structure in your camp

What niggas need to do is stay up off them phones, (Right?)
Bragging about the nigga you popped and killed last night
Cause then the dark gon' come to light, the streets talk
Next thing you know you body all lined in chalk on the sidewalk
I'm laced

[Hook]

[Verse 3: E-40]
I read The D-Boy Diary, The Hustler's Encyclopedia
The Player's Pamphlet, The Hood Wikipedia
The instructions and manual on how to handle certain situations
When you're dealing with fake smiling faces
And they say there's traitors and haters
You can look out for the homey with flying colors
But if you don't do it that one time, you a bitch motherfucker
Ain't that fucked up, what part of the game is this
Brother, throw me a bone, I'mma appreciate it
I stick to the script, I'm a laced individual
Keep a clip on my hip, and under my pillow
Never leave your drink unattended when you're rounding up on a cutie
Might be a setup broad, might slip you a goofy

I'll be damned if I go out that way, feel me
I make her take a sip, if she don't drink it that mean she guilty
Can't be square as a pool table and twice as green
Gotta stand for something or you gon' fall for anything

[Hook]
