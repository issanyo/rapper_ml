Kick this shit about the mail man

[Verse 1: E-40]
Time for the payback, backpay
Can't let homie live to see his birthday
A.K., 47 hot ones to the kidney
Bootsee muthafucka didn't know what hit him
Went way, rode up on his ass in a Chevy
Baby, nigga shoulda known that shit was heavy
Dummy, shouldn't have fucked off all my fuckin' fetti
That I gave him, spent my shit with a nigga from another city
Then they doubled, tripled and sold his ass some swivle
Little old sucker-butt nigga trust the mail man
Now his ass is trash like a garbage can
Caught up in some shit with the mailman
The Mailman

[Chorus: E-40]
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
Had him duckin' every muthafuckin' thing up in the room

[Verse 2: E-40]
They say the youngsters run the penitentiary (I think they do)
They say the youngsters doin shit that you wouldn't believe
They say the youngsters on the street snort hop like a muthafucka
(Hm-hm) Well, check this part out, brother
(Okay) The nigga that the mail man shot
Little homie went to fetch himself a brand-new Glock
(That's right) Wired off that hop, premeditated plot
I'll park around the corner and do a walk-by
Reconciliation, retaliation on my mind
Nothin' against the Muslims, but I was raised eatin' swine
Trapped in the gidname since 1979
My niggas on the street taught me to perk and drink wine
I'm young, full of cum, nuttin' to lose
Paid my dues, I'm settin' the rules
I got some clues, and I refuse
To let the sucker that killed my homie get away smooth

[Chorus: E-40]
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
When I see the mail man, then his ass is doomed

[Verse 3: E-40]
Thinkin, tweakin, sniffin, hoppin', plottin'
Schemin, actin like a demon
My pores is stinkin' and I'm all sweaty
Hallucinatin', smellin' like burnt spaghetti
Oh no, the mail man gotta go
He killed my homie but he forgot that it was one mo', to go
So I figured that he's after me
'Til the word on the streets is that I'm after him, true
Now I'm waitin' for departure
'Cause I'm never late on arrival
Grabbed the landmines, bazookas, grenades, and Tommy
Oh, and I can't forget the Glock 'cause it's the most reliable
Shit, fuck it, I'ma just take the Glock deep
I scoped out his spot, I know where he sleeps
Hot-wired the Thunderbird
I'm headed for the suburbs
Mobbin', doin' about a buck fifty
Took the third exit to another part of the city
Now I'm his presence, about to let him have it
Caught him walkin' to his car, and now he's in a casket

[Chorus: E-40]
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
When I see the mail man, then his ass is doomed
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
(Boom-boom!) now they gloom
My strap went boom
Had him hoppin' like a rabbit tryna touch the fuckin' moon

[Outro]
Mmm-hmm
Mail means money, man
F-l-a-m-b-o-y-a-n-t in this muthafucka
Mmm-hmm, the mail man
Ass-out jungle
Gotta watch your back and play it well
Stay away from faulty muthafuckas
That's real

Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!
(Boom-boom!)
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!
(Boom-boom!)
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!
(Boom-boom!)
Hoppin' like a rabbit tryna touch the fuckin' moon
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!
(Boom-boom!)
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!
(Boom-boom!)
Boom-boom-boom-boom-boom!
(Boom-boom!)
Now his ass is doomed
