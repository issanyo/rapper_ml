[Chorus]
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked...")

[Verse 1: E-40]
Would you look, would you listen
Niggas be snitchin', talkin', rattin'
All up in the joint, man, singin', chattin'
Talkin' that old really fu-fu riff-raff-ass shit, mayne
Speakin' on every nigga in the muthafuckin' dope game
He's scared like a mice
Po-po's talkin' about 25 to life
But real niggas do the time and pay the price, though
Rat heads give up game to the vice, you know
Trick sap wanna hang hisself like a dick
Just because he got popped with a half a zip
Chow time, niggas rush for the vittles
But rat head wants to the talk to the po-po's
Get me outta here, dude, I'm losin' weight, stressin'
So they offer that man some police protection
He couldn't be from the Hillside or the south
'Cause my side of town don't go runnin' off at the mouth
Mickey Mouse spilled his guts
He said, "They all drive Chevys and Cut's'"
But they let him out without a doubt
Nothin'-ass nigga, he straight ratted us out

[Chorus]
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
It's like pizza y'all
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked...")
Cheese y'all

[Verse 2: E-40]
But since he sang such a good song
The pigs even gave his ass a ride home, huh
The blind mice couldn't read braille
They made him sit in the front seat, and drove him all over Vallejo
Popo's gives up no slack, all through the dope tracks
Lettin' this shit really be known, jack
To get a bit too far, kind of ridiculously
Handed the rat some money, and said, "Now you work for me"
He was all for the scratch, see, and just like a batch, G
The nigga played the role of a pussy
Little old pank, crevice-faced faggot
Nigga sold out, and now he wears a snitch jacket
On the turf they wants to get with his PG
But it'll draw too much heat, so they wait patiently
He won't be seen no time soon
'Cause in the V-Town he's doomed
Packed up and straight cut to Suisun
Got in the good with all the hoods and thugs
Expressin', "I'm from the V-Town, dude, 707"
Niggas and bitches was trippin' and shit, havin' a fit
He said, "I even know E-40 and the fuckin' Click"
They damn near shitted, boss
Not knowin' that the nigga was lyin' his ass off
Meanwhile, back in Vallejo
Brothers gettin' knocked for possession of sale
The other races get away clean, brother
But niggas, we always gotta rat on each other

[Chorus]
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Cheese y'all...rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked...")
It's like pizza y'all

[Verse 3: E-40]
A party jumps off on Blueberg Street
Vallejo niggas in that muthafucka hella deep
No funk, no static, nobody's thinkin' about a war
We got Grump in the house, Rhythm X, and hoes galore
Baththub full of liquor and wine
M.D. 20/20, Ever Clear, and Rossi wine
All the danksters gather up
They play the five second game, hold it in and get stupid stuck
Hoes gettin' poked in the backroom
Fools goin' home smellin' like perfume
Nothin' but ballers from different towns
A house full of Nino Browns
Shootin' pool, playin' craps and dominoes
Niggas jackin' off 'Vettes and 5-point-O's
It's all good, 'cause nobody gives a fuck
But look who pops up
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Vallejo niggas yelled out, "Snitch!"
Mobbed his ass, beat him down to the dirt
And straight went bezerk

[Chorus]
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
It's like pizza y'all...rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked, he's a bitch")
Rat heads gettin' nothin' but cheese y'all
("The nigga that talked...")
Cheese y'all
