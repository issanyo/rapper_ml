[Verse 1: E-40]
I used to quarterback ice cream on the block, whole thangs
Broken down to hun’ed pots, Trump change
Dagnabit, everybody in my cabinet had scrill
From the Hillside, Florida Street, to Millersville
Tryin' to keep it real, keep it real, super thug, doe
But I neglected the one that I had love for
You used to let me use your little Pinto when I was grittin’
On my way to the studio ‘cause you know that I be spittin’

[Verse 2: Goapele]
Oooh…you caught me
Lookin' at you, forgive me
But if it's treasures you're seeking
I'm the one who could reach them
It's not the kind of thing
You wanna rush or hesitate
It could go far
If you step to me, just come at me
With honesty and you might get my
Heart

[Chorus]
Ooh, you got it good, baby
Believe me it's all good, baby baby
Ooh, got it good, baby
Believe me it's all good

[Verse 3: Goapele]
Oooh
So soft and
Effortlessly, I'm fallin'
So suddenly you touch me
Your crush on me
On this night might end
Just think we could be anywhere
If i could choose it'd be right here
And I don't let go easily
But something's taken over me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You're saying that our chemistry
Is poetry in motion
And whispering so preciously
I second that emotion

[Verse 4: E-40]
Unh
You’s a bad broad, girl, you sharp
I wanna let you wear my Sick Wid It hog
Lookin’ at my rose gold oyster perpetual
Intellectual sexual healing, mama
I met you at Benihana’s
‘Bout to bust out them seams
Lookin’ good in them Earl jeans, floss
Was they Earl or was they Paper Denim & Cloth?
I forget
Me and you, darlin’, got somethin’ special
And I’m grateful
Just my Calico M-1-10 I’ll be faithful

Baby
Believe me it’s all good, baby baby
Ooh, you got it good, baby
Believe me it’s all good, baby baby
