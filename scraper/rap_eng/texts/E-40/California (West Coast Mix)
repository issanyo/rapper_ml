[Verse 1: Too Short]
Open California at the side show
Used to let the gold diggers call my spokes
You know your boy always got something to smoke
I threw the peace sign when I see my folks
580, to the 585
On my way to LA, and I'm getting high
Blowin bubble cush from Santarosa
Late night Hollywood, I'm in boss and nova
In the 80s, it was freaks and trues
That's me on that Lack, straight rolling through
And when I moved to the A, I brought the west with me
We had the whole town blowin, like a french chimney
Bitch, born in LA, got the gang from the bay
But ain't no place like the city where I stay

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work from California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg]
Born back with the slap, the big California
We the home of the gangsta rap
Where the homies be actin up
But don't trip, on crip, we can back it up
Strapped up, sag it up
Bag it up, dressed in all black like Dracula
Smoke is Snooptacular
I'm at a Laker game, with my own seets
We got the Heat, Cobey, he from Longbeach
And he a jump shooter, but he goin bang on ya
Don't walk through the hood, without that bang on ya
Baby was bad, you wanna put that ring on her
And she ball in heals, she put that pain on ya
This California lifestyle, make you wanna immitate it
It's everywhere, so don't go nowhere

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work from California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali

[Verse 3: Colonel Loud]
You know I gotta show the West love
I had to take a trip to Cali for the best bud
I been chilling with the goons, yeah the real thugs
Went to Sacramento nigga met a real plug
I said I'm looking for the gas where the kill at
Want the strong gotta go where the hill at
I met a bad bopper chilling out in Frisco
Like to sip the lime-a-ritas and the Sisco
I hopped my ass on the 101 and headed north
And when I hit the hill I found what I was looking for
I'm feeling like a leprechaun with a pot of gold
Bags of the gas yeah the Colonel got a soul
I fly a bitch from the A with 100 racks
Put her ass in a rental told her run it back
Fly another bitch in with 200 more
Welcome to California the State of gold

[Chorus: Ricco Barrino]
I stay getting that work from California
And all the killers they show me love in California
I flew a bitch from the A to California
And I be smoking on the best loud in California
Ayy California, oh California
I swear
I got to get back to that place to smoke on that Cali
