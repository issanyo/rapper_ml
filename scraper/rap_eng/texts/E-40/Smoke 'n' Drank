[Verse 1]
(spit that shit)
Durrin a playa like my youth
I think I recall when I got my first tooth
I was a teethin little ol heathen perv off that philippe bombay juice
Some like a little further on down the line
Started fuckin with moonshine, all kind of wines
Stood in front of the liquor house soakin up gidname, from old timers
Buy me a drank man I know it's against the law im underage be a good sport
What you need my little comrade a packet of kool-aid and some whiteport
What else? A thing of beedies and a short neck of Night Train
Whatchu gonna give me? A crumpled up foodstamp that I won in a dice game
Preciate it playa, I'm up out of this bitch bout to go hook up
With my so-hid-nobs relatives simple ones kinfolks
Good folks, y'know, y'know
Twoasted, slerkin, me and my fools be out there back pervin
To' back on your face and start all over again

[Hook]
Let's perv, throw up, and drank again
Let's get high, loaded, and smoke again
(repeat 2X)

[Verse 2]
Just wakin up from my hang-over
Still high, like I swallowed an ounce of yola
Hell yeah I don't wanna ever be sober
Like bein toishin, wake up in the same position, open up the safe
Peep the stash, lookin mighty healthy, plenty of cash
Grabbed my faulty from up out the charger
And then made a dash called up the folks today is the day
For my nigga's birthday twelve o'clock come through he gon get beat
By who? By them hog mog niggas in the cleats
We's deep, no remorse no feelings retardos no sorrow
Drink it til your motherfuckin insides turn hollow (inaudible) cross and wallow
Back to back, struck and strikin, that's your job (that's your job nigga)
To make you lift this tick, fuckit nigga blow a bottle

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Room spinnin, dead
Got the garbage can next to the bed
Now I was tweakin off that old crazy ass commercial on BET Jackie Stallone
What made it so bad is I don't even know how I got home
Niggas ain't feel me y'know fuck this surgeon general
What they need to do is legalize that indo
Dicked a, barren, purple, cush thou'
Smob with me I'm tryin to told ya like you get to perkin
Ride to me I'll teach you some of this game that I be twerkin
Pull this motherfucker over main, ya patna gotta go piss again
Don't even sweat it though just be on the lookout for so-and-so
Now whatchu be callin them po-po's? the dont-knows
Penelopes, grill up out of this bitch man
I got warrants, let's go get some Hen mayne

[Hook + Outro]
