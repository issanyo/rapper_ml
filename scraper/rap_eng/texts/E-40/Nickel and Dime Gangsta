[Intro: Casual]
I go dumb
Yananamean, yananamean
Yananamean, yananamean
Yananamean, yananamean
Yananamean…
(Gangsta) Check it out

[Verse 1: Casual]
I got a bullet for every nigga in your entourage
Give him a pistol deep tissue massage
That’s how I’m fuckin’ wit’ it, killin’ ‘em, filling my rhymes
I get higher than Bellagio ceiling designs
I bumped your main hoochie, mainly because you game goofy
Ain’t no colorful nigga, I rocks the plain Coogi, and the frames Gucci
Ain’t gon’ talk about clothes because I ain’t bootsie
Ya boy Bay bossy, huh, so stay off me
Please don’t make call them hitters out to handle you dudes
Have your family holding candles on the Channel 2 news
Y’all could be hurt, you’ll be the next block dead homie T-shirt
Pack the heat for the static while I’m smoking on a Black and sweet aromatic
Homie, keep staring at it
Ay, I go dumb—what, you want some?
It ain’t even grapes no more, we smoke plums

[Chorus]
See, I’ve been running this game all my life
You know I’m always staying gangsta (Gangsta)
But not a baller in nickel and dimin’, I’m always stayin’ gangsta (Keep it gangsta)
If you a hustler, you understand and what it takes to survive
Tryna come up on the streets, stay alive
‘Cause you came up through all of the struggles and always stay gangsta (So keep it gangsta)

[Verse 2: E-40]
I get high like Califoolya gas prices, driving on a suspended license
3 o’clock in the morning every morning I hear sirens
Paddy wagons and ambulances, squad cars and violence
And it ain’t nobody talking ‘cause witnesses keep they silence
It’s a minus if the retaliation don’t go into affection
The same day that it happened, make sure it’s nothin’ pleasant
These suckas’ll play you for false and try to hit ya
Act like they wit’cha but fools be really against ya
You see, I never tell a botch all my business, that’s not a groovy look
The same broad’ll be the same broad that’ll have you took
The same broad that put you in jail the last time
For slappin’ the shit out her ass for tellin’ the first time
See, it’s rules in this type of shit I abide by
One is: don’t enter the game unless you are ready to die
I’m a product of the soil and I made some cash
But gotta get in and get out if you expectin’ to last

[Chorus]
See, I’ve been running this game all my life
You know I’m always staying gangsta (Gangsta)
But not a baller in nickel and dimin’, I’m always stayin’ gangsta (Keep it gangsta)
If you a hustler, you understand and what it takes to survive
Tryna come up on the streets, stay alive
‘Cause you came up through all of the struggles and always stay gangsta (So keep it gangsta)

[Verse 3: Casual]
I fold racks with cold cats
House dipped, couldn’t tell if it’s wallpaper or gold plaques
And I ain’t ever sold no crack
Hov did that so I wouldn’t have to go through that (Who told you that?)
I’m from the Bay, gangsta, I stay gangsta
Grimey, grungy, all that, we hungry
Call back, I’m spongy, soak up game
Don’t get broke up, Smash got the West Coast woke up, huh
Put your paws up, nigga, get your bars up
‘Cause I can read your mind, you’re like, “He raw as fuck”
I stay smashin’, I ain’t polite
Smash Rock do his gangsta right, blow an eighth a night
And just to make it right, I skate with Mike
The drop 6-4 thang, Aikman white
You ain’t gotta be a gangsta to be gangsta
Just smash and shine like an OG gangsta

[Chorus]
See, I’ve been running this game all my life
You know I’m always staying gangsta (Gangsta)
But not a baller in nickel and dimin’, I’m always stayin’ gangsta (Keep it gangsta)
If you a hustler, you understand and what it takes to survive
Tryna come up on the streets, stay alive
‘Cause you came up through all of the struggles and always stay gangsta (So keep it gangsta)
