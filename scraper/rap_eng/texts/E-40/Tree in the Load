[Verse 1: E-40]
Keeping the torch lit, rub two sticks
One hundred (one hundred)
Like an old school Nolan Ryan pitch
Who want it?  (who want it?)
It ain't going take but a minute, a New York moment
The Bay Area backwards streets is haunted
It’ll give you the creeps if you ain't from it
They’ll draw down on the opponent kaboom kaboom
In the night time or the morning or the afternoon
Hella busy if the governor called I push ignore
Even though I got 3 jacks like Pablo Sandoval
You can call me your highness, your majesty
Because I get the highest, defy gravity
Trying to throw a party in her mouth
What you thought? (what you thought?)
In the AM/PM bathroom
Hope I don’t get caught (don't get caught)
With this broccoli I bought from the broccoli man
With all of my partners all hemmed up in front of my van
It’s a wrap like a pita they going take me to Rita
If they catch me me and find the squeezer
Up under this seat is a heater, a 10 millimeter
Illegal search and seizure (bitch)

[Hook: Cousin Fik]
Got the old school with the white top
Gold thangs sittin' right on vogues (right on vogues)
Made 25 stacks last night
Hit the mall and spend it all on clothes (all on clothes)
Gettin' rich, only took hold up
Hell nah the po-po don’t know (they don't know)
In this thang all night, aight post it up
Blow 'em tree in the load (tree in the load)

[Verse 2: Choose Up Cheese]
Easy thousand dollars for the kit gang
24-5 for a brick, man
Us on the table that’s fish scale
Mercedes of the lot I’ll fish tail
My little niggas crazy like Columbine
Doing anything for them dolla signs
Boy if you hating then you outta line
I didn't wear my watch today, you outta time
Cuttin' posse in that old school vert
No cash hear that old school skrrrt
I don’t want your nookie I am not Fred Durst
I'm all about my cheese ho, I flip bread first
Choose Up Cheese I done mastered the scale
Check my record 'cause that shit for sale
Ask Solano courthouse I got a long paper trail
When I’m starting these rentals no these niggas can’t tell
A young nigga

[Verse 3: Cousin Fik]
Cousin Fik, look
It’s burning up in this motherfucker
Somebody cut the fan on
Got the eagle in the air nigga
I'm just looking for a spot for it to land on
Sitting in the kitchen counting chickens for west coast tricking
Bitches on a mission for the riches, trapping off a cricket
Probably wanna kick it but I’m tripping 'cause I’m tryna get it
Sip it 'til it’s finished, young menace, give the ho the business
Spit the flow fool on the pro tools
Flip an old school, riding on feet call it no shoes
I strolled through, I told do she so loose like a fo' sho' goose
But she broke so it’s no use, I’m so cool I throw deuce
I’m sick with it, couldn't give a fuck about your crew
I don’t know you, I've been down, you so new
I’m so stuck nigga no glue straight grapes
You say I’m weak with a straight face I bounce
But until then I’m trapping when you pull up to the house
You see a nigga
