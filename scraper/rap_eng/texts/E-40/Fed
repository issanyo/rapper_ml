[Intro: Samples & Suga-T]
There is something going on down here
In Vallejo
FedEx
In Vallejo, California
In Vallejo
In Vallejo, California

[Chorus: Suga-T]
He said he's just a
Timer, name ringin'
Major factor, FedEx
High-powered lawyers, and a
Young nigga havin' his way

[Verse One: E-40]
Lil' mannish ass nigga on restriction
Cryin' with his motherfuckin' nose in the corner
Broke up out of that old punk shit and said
"Momma I'mma do what the fuck I wanna!"
Hit the streets and make a wheelbarrow full of bread if I end up dead
Then press delete, I'm tired of eating potted meat
Within the nick of time a nigga hit the grind, so a dope boy scored a quarter key
Two hundred and fifty-two electronic milligrams
We'll sell rock coke candy, the organization
That I'm plugged with, they off into that old high-powered shit
These are the type of niggas that'll let a nigga know
When the drought about to hit, [?]
[?], post it on God
Because me got me scratch paper buried in the backyard
Me and my Click roll thick f'real don't be fakin' the funk like you a boss
Problems nigga? Let that go or get your head tooken off
Catch you out of bounds on the wrong fuckin soil
Wrap that ass up like aluminum foil
I'm FedEx, heavy duty nigga, pushin' weight (pushin' weight)
From sardines and Spam to Teriyaki steak; motherfucker ain't
But sixteen, fuckin' around with the skillet, makin' a killin'
Runnin' through three or four units a week on the over over puttin' the Whammy on 'em
(Whammy on 'em)
Cake up and baking soda, all that old shit
(What's your occupation?) Motherfucker I'm a timer

[Chorus: Suga-T]
Timer, name ringin'
Major factor, FedEx
High-powered lawyers, and a
Young nigga havin' his way
Let 'em know, let 'em know, mayne
Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know, boy
Let 'em know, let 'em know, mayne
Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know, boy

[Verse Two: E-40]
Bitch I thought ya knew, bitch I thought ya knew; huh, now check it
I'm to the point where I don't touch it no mo'
You probably got lieutenants and killers all on the squadron
With po-po's on payroll, huh
Lavish vehicles, they only make like fo'of
Front row seats at the fights, takin long expensive flights, huh
Qs, Ps, birth certificates and fake IDs
Like to drink liquor, with beedis in leaves
The motherfuckin fuzz wanna stop us
Found our fingerprints on some choppers
Listenin to the scanner, I hear the Penelope's say
"Man uhh, them nigga boys, I can't stand uhh"
Young hoodlums sellin' hop, cloggin' up the block
In they come anew six-double-zero drop
We party in mansions, VIPs nigga fuck a flyer
Invite celebrities like E-40 and J.R. Rider, timer

[Hook]
I'm so serious
I'm so serious, brotha
I'm so serious, brotha
I got m-

[Chorus: Suga-T]
He said he's just a
Timer, name ringin'

Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know, boy
Let 'em know, let 'em know, mayne
Let 'em know, let 'em know, let 'em know, boy

[Interlude]
Hello?
Wassup fool!
What's happenin' who dis?
Nigga it's yo' boy!
My bo- wassup you timer, when your ass gone retire?

On a mission 'bout my mail to the Hillside of Vallejo (7X)

[Verse Three: E-40]
You niggas got me fucked, fucked up
Me yank myself up out the game? Hold up, motherfucker
I got bills to pay, nigga if you don't get out my way
I'm gonna peels your toupee
I'm in it to stay and I'm straight from the Bay
But I never woulda thought that I would feel like
That I can invest my money in a franchise
Get em up out the hood before my homies lose they lizzives
Buy a fuckin' record company and watch my mail rise

[Outro]
Ha ha, yeah, timer
Big timer, a motherfucker have his bread, man
FedEx to the highest degree, tax free
Ballin' out of motherfuckin' control
A major factor playin a white man's game man
Sneak in and sneak out
Campaign champagne and claim fame
Game can be sold and told at the same time
And this shit here is designed to sprinkle yo' mind
High-powered ass shit man for my high-powered ass Clickalation
Get it while it's good and look forward to graduation
Understand me?
