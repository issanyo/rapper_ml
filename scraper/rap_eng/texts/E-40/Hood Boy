[Chorus:]
I bet you ain't never seen 26's on a range
Iced out VVS stones and a chain
She want a hood boy [x4]
I bet shorty never seen a nigga pushin' that work
Gettin it, how he live stuntin on the turf
She want a hood boy [x4]

[Verse 1:]
(Ooh) She want a hood boy she don't want no mark
Body art on his arm's and neck and across his heart
They throwin up the block I represent my part
It's a zoo I got more animals then Noah's ark
I keep the bottles cracked I got the dro sparked, 44 cocked  and S65 parked
I'm a hood boy I be ridin wet,insides jelly touchscreen deck
They say you go boy I love yo swag and staljha
I remember fo' you rap you used to sell that yowder
Breitling for Bentley watch 26 inch socks
Pick a ride girl I got a car lot

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
(Ooh) I got paper but I be on the under
Every 3 or 4 weeks I change my phone number
Pope's be trying to watch me on some old shit
I give em  the same line I don't know shit
I don't want a model
I want some stretch marks,30 pound butt meat cheeks pull apart
Damn I be coonin', Japanese jeans on
Shorty on my line, she got me on her ringtone
She love me I like her, I'm too hood to wife her
I'm to hood to wife her, plus I got 3 just like her
I'm on this XO Landy,mixed with 40 water

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
I can tell when she lookin at me (at me)
I can tell she want a nigga from the streets
She want that hood boy [x4]
I can tell when she lookin at me (at me)
I can tell she want a nigga like 40
She want that hood boy [x4]

[Chorus]
