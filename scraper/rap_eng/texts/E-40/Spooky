[Verse 1:]
Hard drugs you knuckle head and thugs, fake identification, getting kicked out of clubs
If it wasn't for my PEN I'd be in a PEN...
In the Bay where I stay, is eerie and grim
Smurkish, merkey, spooky and eerie, never know which one of my partners gonna try to rob me and kill me
Thats why I keep my ear to the gravel
My cleats to the turf
California built me for battle
Since the day I was birthed
First day on the earth, my first breathe of life
Coffins and hearst. everyday somebody done died
Dispute and disperse they cut him down with a nine millimeter heater shot him in his torso and spine

[Hook:]
See that ball cap low, dark face so we lurk on these niggas
Graveyard shift clocking in faithful
Pay me consistant
Smurkish, murky eerie grim
It's spooky
Out here on the grind
So spooky
I'm just trying to get mine

[Verse 2:]
This spook just stood by the door
They shut the trap house down, with nails and boards
My auntie neck still sore
The PO Po beat her ass and threw her on the floor
Plus I got more than half a key
Gotta pay my lawyer fee
Out there on the streets they owe me
Side to side like a wheel alignment, its right and its left
School is in session my nigga pull up yo desk
I got that old money mixed in with a little bit of this new money
Fuck with niggas that's real
I dont fuck with the false or phoney
Me and my holmies and chronies
My relatives and my partners
Trying to raise up our sons and our daughters to grow up and become some scholars

[Hook:]

Mine mine mine
Get mine get mine

[Verse 3:]
They pulled up with the slap
While I was washing and drying my clothes at the neighborhood laundrymatt
Loose as a goose my pants; I almost crapped
Out of bounds lastnight I let my cousin borrow my strap
My life's surrounded by crack, but I wanta give back
Move on top of the hill, even though i'm straight from the flats
Go out and buy me a grill, for my teeth and my lac
Man I got get back skills, if my fetti collapse
Personality and attitude of a ghetto child
Fuck a deal man i'm taking this shit to trial
My attorney done did all that he can do
So I'm a stay silent all the way through
See that ball cap low, dark face so we lurk on these niggas
Graveyard shift clocking in faithful
Pay me consistant
Spurkish, murky eerie grim
It's spooky
Out here on the grind
So spooky
I'm just trying to get mine
