[Intro: E-40]
Yeah, E-40 and the muthafuckin' C-L-I-C-K in this muthafucka, you know
I got my cousin Kaveo on the muthafuckin' side of me
We finna spit some of this old flamboyant shit
Check game:

[Verse 1: E-40]
It's another one of them droughts, my sahob, and this shit costs us like fuck
Niggas takin' losses that they can't make up
Gettin' gaffled for some of that shit call cake up
Stretchin' the crack, makin' a bad batch
The screen from a tweaker's pipe turns black!
So they go crazy, get hot-headed, start actin' a fool, yellin'
But you all know it ain't no refunds in this shit that I'm sellin'!
'Cause during the drought season, niggas be lookin' for a reason to rush ya
So I suggest you put up your bootsies, man, and pull out your buckets

[Verse 2: Kaveo]
Here's another part of this shit that a nigga needs to uplift about the game
The drought season, mayne, 'cause this shit here never remains the same
And a brother ain't about to let his muthafuckin' capital go lame
So instead he's gots to get scandalous
'Cause he can't keep up and handle his business
Like he used to, and he ain't with really being through
Gets outta school and a kid gotta make a smooth come-up lick
Catchin' muthafuckas outta bounds, swerve
Breakin' they punk ass, leave 'em slurred
This is the type of shit that occur
So don't get caught loose on turf

[Verse 3: E-40]
I gots meals, wheels, and about five thousand dollars worth of bills
Bank account way in the red, fuckin' with the highest overhead
Jackin' off my money, yo' ass is out, boy, and I promise you that
I'm a money hungry muthafucka and I'm so serious about my scratch
So your best bet is to check yourself before you wreck yourself, punk bootch
I gets down and dirty like Dr. Ruth, and I put that on the Gooch
Droppin' muthafuckas just like a bad habit, dag-nab-it
Tricks wanna get outta line I let 'em have it, now bag it
I got ice cream, candy and all kinds of things of that flavor
And maybe later I might be willin' to go low as long as you a buyer before
'Cause I'm the only muthafucka' with A-1 yola
None of that ol' cake up with bakin' soda
It gets released, ceased, and then the prices rises like yeast
Those who got leftovers will become obese
Triplin' my mail off the triple beam scale
I even got enemies with envy askin' me for yayo

[Chorus]
The Drought Season, niggas lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feast'n
The Drought Season, niggas lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feast'n

[Verse 4: Kaveo]
A nigga's tryin' to work hard on a meal ticket so I can't stand to be dry
'Cause after strong demand and supply
But in the drought season it's hard to get by
Niggas be runnin' off with D gafflin' muthafuckas, startin' at chances
'Cause a nigga's mail ain't too muthafuckin' fancy
Rollin' around in a deuce-and-a-quarter
Can't get caught loose on the border
Sittin' on them thangs like 40 would say
Fuckin' with a bitch's brain

[Verse 5: E-40]
Can't be affected by the Great Depression
This country is in a recession, I reckon
So let me give yo ass a funkin' lesson
Never let a muthafucka know what you got or what you buyin'
It's them bootsie muthafuckas in your town that's always dyin'
Stay low, play the background, keep your shit on a hush, mate
Hit it hard one time and then hibernate

[Verse 6: Kaveo]
Now check game, I'm tryin' to do my own muthafuckin' thang
But shit just ain't right
The heaters done got way too tight
Jackin' muthafucka's on sight
But I'm a nigga that don't give a fuck
When I'm tryin to get my cash flow up
In one of them there seasons whatever the reason may be
Niggas comin' up short, tied, gagged, washed ashore from out from sea
For sale signs on a nigga's shit
'Cause he ain't got no muthafuckin' D
Sellin' up everything made of material, G
The Drought Season

[Chorus]
The Drought Season, niggas lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feast'n
The Drought Season, niggas lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feast'n

[Verse 7: E-40]
I'm really not all sure about when things is finna mature
So let me find me a nigga with a grip and hit his ass quick with a lick
What's your definition of a lick?
Takin' a niggas shit
Put that on somethin'
I put that on The Click
If you consider yourself a hustla, you can't be no busta brown
Stackin' mail, straight come up and when funk come around, be down

[Verse 8: Kaveo]
A nigga's gotta have some type of hustle
Whether it's sellin' dank or robbin' banks
Snitches can't go to the pen 'cause they'll fuck around and wind up shanked
In the presence of drought season, shit gets hectic
Niggas losin' they lives when they least expect it

[Verse 9: E-40]
It's E-40 and my cousin Kaveo lettin' muthafuckas know, mayne
Spittin' that ol' shit that muthafuckas don't understand, and
Tardy to the crazy ass game, yeah, but gotta be clever
Especially in this type of weather, ya Know?
The Drought Season
("Thought he had 'caine but it was Gold Medal flour")

[Chorus]
The Drought Season, niggas lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feast'n
The Drought Season, niggas lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feast'n
The Drought Season, niggas lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feast'n
The Drought Season, niggas lookin' for a reason
It's like Thanksgiving without the feast'n

[Outro]
