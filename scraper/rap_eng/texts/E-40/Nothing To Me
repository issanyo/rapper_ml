[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
People talk, it's just word of mouth
No, it ain't nothing to me
You talking loud cause I'm not around
Yeah, that's something to see
Say I’m the man and I'm winning now
That shit ain't nothing to me
And all these hunnids that I'm pulling out
It's a lot to you but ain't nothing to me
It's a lot to you, It's a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me
It's a lot to you, It's a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
You dipped ya toe inside that water while I'm chest high
Explains all this basicness that you get impressed by
Tall and lanky so I'm not even a flex guy
Commercial melodies to pay to have them jets fly
No more coach and until the day I die stiff
I am at a level most of y'all be satisfied with
Want some advice well here's my gift:
You’re falling off you should go speed up the process
Go somewhere and find a high cliff
Oh, it's all coming back to me now
You saw me hot and got signed now you actually foul
Time is money I ain't wasting none, it has to be now
The word legend's thrown around so causally now
I want it all, pardon my manners
But you've done nothing that matters
Maybe I am not understanding your standards
See we measured in the money that you made, short
It's not the same league, it's not even the same sport, now

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
People talk, it's just word of mouth
No it ain't nothing it me
You talking loud cause I'm not around
Yeah that's something to see
Say I’m the man and I'm winning now
That shit ain't nothing to me
And all these hunnids that I'm pulling out
It's a lot to you, but ain't nothing to me
It's a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to you
Its a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to you

[Verse 2: G-Eazy]
And I remember I was stacking money
Though I wanted clothes and Jordans, leather jacket money
Now I want tobacco money
Where everything you sell, they keep on coming back to money
And I ain't even close to gotti yet, don't get confused
But everybody got choices, you can pick and choose
These people disrespect the game until it gets abused
They saying Gerald's 'bout to kill 'em, but this isn't news
See, you're a player in the game, but playing different rules
You struggling, guess we'll just wait to see if this improves
You had a chance at the dance, but was missing queues
You couldn't get the steps down, cause these are different moves
Pay attention, life is like a dice game, your life is like a bike lane
There's more to buy then just a nice chain
New flavor for you cause your life's plain
A day inside the life with us could make your life change, yeah

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
People talk, it's just word of mouth
No it ain't nothing it me
You talking loud cause I'm not around
Yeah that's something to see
Say I’m the man and I'm winning now
That shit ain't nothing to me
And all these hunnids that I'm pulling out
It's a lot to you, but ain't nothing to me
Its a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to you
It's a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to you

[Bridge: Keyshia Cole]
Cause when you used to it, other people ain't used to it
They only copy when you do do it
Cause when you used to it, other people ain't used to it
They only copy when you do do it

[Verse 3: E-40]
I'm the realest in it, but ya'll don't show it
But in the back of ya'll motherfucker's mind ya know it
I'm a poet with versatility, biggie gave me 0 visibility
Wish him and the homie Pac was still alive
If they was, rap would be more live
But they not, so I'm filling in they space
Rap game Mount Rushmore, they carving out my face
I done seen fly-by-nights on the cover of source  and XXL
Me and hip-hop thought about getting divorced and that's for real
But I stay loyal to the broad that saved my life, my wife
If it wasn't for rap, I would've crapped out on the dice

[Chorus: Keyshia Cole]
People talk, it's just word of mouth
No it ain't nothing it me
You talking loud cause I'm not around
Yeah that's something to see
Say I’m the man and I'm winning now
That shit ain't nothing to me
And all these hunnids that I'm pulling out
It's a lot to you, but ain't nothing to me
Its a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me
Its a lot to you, Its a lot to you
But it ain't nothing to me
