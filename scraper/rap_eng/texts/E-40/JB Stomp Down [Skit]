[Verse]
Man Its colder than a hookerâ€™s heart out here I know its hell on these streets Radley and a bowl of teriyaki
With your shoes so  turned over you got to lay down to get in them mayne
Ya dig? mayne I know how it is being across trained in this game ya dig
Thats what happens man
But you know whens youse a stomp down hustler and a real playa
Man you go from ghetto streets to the executive streets
