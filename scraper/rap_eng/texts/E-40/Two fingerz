[VERSE 1:E-40]

You used to be sweet as honey
Used to be my honey
But you switched up on when my money started looking funny
Got your partners all in your ear now you being weird
Used to pour up, toast up, cheers, now its nothing but tears
You bad as fuck with a big o butt but your attitude fucked up
Guess all them likes on your selfies bitch got your mind all fucked up
You know me all my life I been real never phony
You gonna make me fuck around and make me fuck one of your hommies

[VERSE 2:Adrian Marcel]

Girl you got me fucked up
One thought of you I say fuck love
Cause you be on that fuck stuff
And I'm tired of your shit
It was never love at first sight
It was only love one the first night
I should of known that you wouldn't be right
But I had to give you one try


[HOOK]

How i was supposed to know that you was gonna tell me all these lies
Drive me in the dirt
While look me in my face
I'm leaving you alone
Even though I try to hide inside
Damn I really hurt
My heart you can't replace
I'm giving you two fingerz girl
Two fingerz girl
Two fingers girl
Move on
Ones for the pain, all the drama, the trouble
Twos for the tears i cried when i loved ya
Two fingerz girl
Two fingerz girl
Two fingerz girl
Move on
Tears in the bucket
Girl fuck it we over
All ways remember I really loved ya

[VERSE 3:Adrian Marcel]

I was the one
O really
Then you turned around and played off
Talking shit
O really
You said i was the one that hurt you girl
Gave you my all
When you said my all wasn't much
Damn I never ran the game on you
Cause I was to in love

[HOOK]

How i was supposed to know that you was gonna tell me all these lies
Drive me in the dirt
Still look me in my face
I'm leaving you alone
Even though I try to hide inside
Damn I really hurt
Somethings you can't replace
I'm giving you two fingerz girl
Two fingerz girl
Two fingers girl
Move on
Ones for the pain, all the drama, the trouble
Twos for the tears i cried when i loved ya
Two fingerz girl
Two fingerz girl
Two fingerz girl
Move on
Tears in the bucket
Girl fuck it we over
All ways remember I really loved ya

[VERSE 4:E-40]

You played with my heart you took it to wipe you feet on
Get out of my life be go bitch before I slap you with this phone bitch
Pack your bags and tears up out of here
I don't want your ungreatful ass no more
All these bitches I could of had
Bitch i was faithful to your ass
I showed you the other side of the game
Took you from state to state
200 hunnit a plate
Lobster and shrimp scampi
Some times a hot stake
Before me
You wouldn't know nothing bout a corkish feed
Just recent I was thinking about getting down on one knee
But now

[HOOK]

How i was supposed to know that you was gonna tell me all these lies
Drive me in the dirt
Still look me in my face
I'm leaving you alone
Even though I try to hide inside
Damn I really hurt
Somethings you can't replace
I'm giving you two fingerz girl
Two fingerz girl
Two fingers girl
Move on
Ones for the pain, all the drama, the trouble
Twos for the tears i cried when i loved ya
Two fingerz girl
Two fingerz girl
Two fingerz girl
Move on
Tears in the bucket
Girl fuck it we over
All ways remember I really loved ya
