Man I put that on my grand daddy daughter (ma grand daddy daughter)
On ma daddy’s baby mama (daddy’s baby mama)

[Verse 1]
On mamas, grandmamas babymamas
Man I put that on my lil mamas
Nigga out of line hit him with that [?]
Bitch shut up you ain’t got a single dollar
Can’t speak the language of a nigga with no money
Get it out the mud rob the plug [?] smoke money
Nigga got fat off the dinner we cook
And couldn’t invite us to the table for the dinner we took
[?] look do I seem like I'm missing niggas
Forgies on a Euro thing and every week I switch the wheels
No biniz like hoe biniz
Man way too solid can’t be around no snitches
You on that [?] pack
Them boys will have them boys up in yo biniz
Boy we can’t have that ice city off polar bear
And don’t think we square we soldiers here

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You ain’t from the camp you be going under
He’s in here nigga [?] wonder
And those thing like rain it ain’t even thunder
I was bringing light into this thing to get asunder
I'm from an era where you had to know how to rap
Fuck a mixtape hoe album nigga full of slap
Where I'm connected and respected all through the back
Straight out of Oakland where them sucker niggas move away
Didn’t slip on a nana peel I fucked the [?]
Enter JA built to last nigga here to stay
So fuck the gang and you take it to another state
Them niggas forget where they came from on the way
I'm finna roll a hunnid then I'm going down
Anytime you see me [?] strap never seen [?]
By the time you see it, done [?]
Still breaking bread [?]

[Hook]
Man I put that on my grand daddy daughter (ma grand daddy daughter)

[Verse 3]
Ay Mistah F.A.B this thing snap like a mother fucka
I'm glad my daddy didn’t use a rubber
Mama didn’t raise a sucker she raised a hustler man
Another one like the other one my grand dad had
When I was a little boy I used to be nosy
All up in grown folks business, cozy
Me and my cousin [?] and young og
Sponged up gang when I was five
A student wasn’t true about the decimals
I could sell dry ice to and eskimo
Some of you probably heard that line before
But the dry ice part made it dope
In nineteen eighty five I was the shit
Thirty years later I'm still the shit
I've been it for a grip for a minute forever bitch
I'm the one that taught you to stack and invest your shit

[Hook]
Man I put that on my grand daddy daughter (ma grand daddy daughter)
On ma daddy’s baby mama (daddy’s baby mama)
On my grand mama baby  (grand mama baby)
