[Intro:]
Ugh

[Verse 1:]
I graduated from-yayo college (yayo college?)
Ya get it, yayo college
That’s where I learn ma knowledge
Only eels fight piece of a layer
Where you hit a parkin car if ya stitch ya tail
An the popail they don’t play (don’t play)
Pull ya ova 3 times in one day
Make me get on one knee act like ya fenna pray (fenna pray)
Beat ya ass an leave you in da alley way
I limit your space, your space is narrow
Come through wit d rubber grip, big barrel
Leave yo head hollow like a pocket
Pull up on d side a dat ass an start dumpin
Braah-braah-braah-braah-braah!
We can drop d straps an start dumpin
But that ain’t what ya choose now die dudes
Rap an kill ya, cut ya down wit d road killer
An put you in d dirt where it’s moist
Leave a mothafucka no choice but to
Braah-braah-braah-braah-braah!
Bust back put him on his back

[Chorus:]
Quick, run fast hide yo dope!
(Roooop!) damn here come d pope
Throw it on d roof because he let d canines loose
Toss it in d gutter so d rain will wash away d proof[x2]

[Verse 2:]
It’s 18 zippers in a half a unit
There’s 36 z’s in d hallway (in d hallway)
There’s 24 brews in a case a beer, there’s 365 days in d year
There’s 28 days in d shortest month an if ya pack it right you can fit a 8 in a blunt
They don’t leave shells when they slaughter (when they slaughter), it’s 6 shots in tha revolver
Ma brawds neva get no sleep, L.I.P twenty holes deep (holes deep)
People tune in when I speak (when I speak)
Tha pharmaceuticals, ma playas play for keep
Or should I say forget the valley jaws that i wrecked
Magazine greed, hustla holdin down tha set
Shootin down d ave in a all white now
Dropping turf talk cause I’m married to the ave

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
One foot in tha grave, ma other foot in the pen
If ya plan on gettin paid betta have tough skin
Got the AK the split to west end, just in case you gotta put down demonstration
45 second check a nigga, talkin dumb off d liquor
Jus cause I’m d gangster den don’t you think that I won't split you
I’m a cranium an half if I take it to da max, jus like a lumber jack in d woods wit a axe
Look at d rhymes dat I wrote, look at d style dat I poked
Can’t take me too serious, can’t take me for a joke
Nothing you can do but sit down an take notes
And listen to da best kept secret on da coast
Some talk about it but I really live d it ya’ll
Been doin d same thing since porky pig was a piglet ya’ll
I’m jus a playa having caash (caash)
Cause I’m married to the ave

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Ugh!
Check it out, yea
Married to d ave (yea I’m married to d a-ave!) [x8]
