[Hook: Jonn Hart]
Slide in that thang, real deep game
Bust it so good girl what's my name?
Hit it from the back, headboard swag
When I talk shit Shawty answer right back
Got me yelling like who booty is it, who booty is it?
Who booty, who booty, who booty is it?
Who booty is it, who booty is it?
Who booty, who booty, who booty is it?

[Verse 1: Jonn Hart]
She got a big booty so I call her big booty
She got a big booty so I call her big booty
She gon' let a nigga cut
I just wanna, I just wanna get it from the front
(?) swagging, got the girl stuck
Quarterback style so I throw it in her gut
Got her running back, cause she can’t get enough
Baby she a freak, she said put it in her butt
I’m too trill, how I beat it up
I dive in like a Phelps (?)
I’m back stroking in that thing
I let my (?)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: E-40]
(She know who booty it is, you feel me?)
She like it on me, she know I’m a factor
She like the way I talk, the way I spit my vernacular
After first 3 words I knew that I had her
Ever since then, I've been tapping her
She want me to buy her things her man can't afford like Tom Ford
Jeffrey Campbell boots and Helen Moore
Plus that Paige denim, ragged (?) jeans
How'd you get all that in 'em without busting out the seams?
We make a good team, you know I move mean, manage
I’m balling as fixture from the magazine
Eating like a king, you can be my queen
You make the crevice drop, I make the crevice cream

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Clyde Carson]
Team player, when I call, you respond, baby
Deep undercover, James Bond, baby
Waitlist, single file, got a line, baby
You say my name like it’s mine, but you ain’t my lady
Secret lover can’t pass up
Squeeze covers, bite the pillow, toot your ass up
Got the type of cash that you can’t add up
Young Ron O’Neal on his last run
Say you love young Clyde when hit it from the back
Go slow, cause you can’t take it all, too fat
When we done roll an L and I hit you with a stack
Who booty, you ain’t even gotta ask

[Hook]
