[Intro: D-Shot + E-40]
Man, E, did I tell you about this tender I hooked up with at the club last night?
Unh-uh, you didn’t even tell me the blasé
Man, she was like proper
Clydesdale?
Clydesdale, 6-footer
Well, what was up with baby?
She say she got a man; I just gave her my number and told her to call me on the under
Mm, like that?
Like that…

[Chorus: Levitti]
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number

[Verse 1: D-Shot]
Late one night, me and road dawg got the bar twisted
Perved, trippin’ off the times that’s hard
Drunk off that gin
Talkin’ about how the black man never wins
And so I looks to my right
I spotted this freak, and man, she was hooker tight
And so I kept my eyes on her
Until she got the contact that the Shot wanted to know her
And so I made my move, strutted real smooth
And straight game was pursued
She was lovin’ every minute of it
And at that point, that’s when the Shot started lustin’
She said, “I gotta go, I gotta get gone”
I’m like, “Why?”, “’Cause my man’s at home”
Well, take my pager number
If you need someone to talk to, call me on the under

[Chorus: Levitti]
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the unda
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number

[Verse 2: E-40]
I’m scattin’, I’m scootin’, listening to The Click
Peepin’ out the tenders ridin’ up and down the strip
As I veer to the left I see a car fulla
Light-skinneded hotties in a Corsica
They was bouncin’ up and down sayin’ “Hey”
But I was going the opposite way
Busted me a U-ey in the middle (middle)
Hit the gas pedal just a little (little)
Bumper to bumper, side by side, I’m finna be at the
One on the passenger side looking like Halle Berry
Baby wasn’t really trippin’, if anything, she was tippin’
Sittin’ up there talkin’ about:
“E-40 Water, I love you, I’m really down for the stickin’”
Where y’alls about to be? She said they’s about to be at the cariby
But I’m finna, like, try to plug up with a big ol’ baller like you, E
I said, “You ain’t said anything but a word, I thought you heard
I’m the one to make you wonder
Here’s my voicemail number, call me on the under"

[Chorus: Levitti]
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number

[Verse 3: D-Shot]
Pick up the phone and dial 1-900
So the Shot could come through and straight plug it
By the way, the tender said “Hey
Bring a little bit of dank and some Rossi”
So we can pidnerv straight to the cidnurb
I thought you hidneard
That the Shot was down for the rubbin’
Before we start, do a little touchin’
So the S-H-O-T can go to work
Several styles on the couch, makin’ them legs jerk
Then take a puff of the dank for extra energy
And wait, until the next hoe calls me

[Chorus: Levitti]
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number
You can call me on the under
If you need someone to talk to, just dial my number

[Interlude: D-Shot + Female]
*phone rings*
Hello
Hello, what’s up?
Yeah, what’s up?
Nothin’, you, baby. You know I ain’t seen you in a while and thangs
And you know I’m kinda missin’ you, and, uh, my man is gonna be gone for a few days
And I wanna know if we can get together and hook it up

[Outro: D-Shot & E-40 + (Levitti)]
I just want to plug a little bit (I wanna plug)
I just want to plug a little bit (I wanna plug you the right way)
I just want to plug a little bit (I wanna plug you, baby)
I just want to plug a little bit (We can keep it on the under, ah yeah)
(Just a little bit, oh, nobody has to know)
(I’ll be plugging you…on the late night…just a little bit)
