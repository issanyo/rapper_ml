[Intro:]
Just let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free x2)
Just let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free )
Just put it in the air
Roll up light up
And let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free x2)
Just put it in the air (air, air)
Eoll up light up
And let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free x2)

[Verse 1:]
They smell backward in the air they know the matches up in here
We cut throat cut kush cloudin up the atmosphere
Cutty burning simultaneously ain't shit swishy sweet
Might burn us out like Dj C, scantinan  weed
Today I hit the shop and cop top shelf 3
Light it up and throw us the T
Regular or honey berry it don’t matter to me
Cut half banana pack with cherry pie key
If I’m holdin we rollin and smokin
Am shit red fizz na crip can’t fist pokin
Mord stone loading hard to keep my eyes open
Feel like lightin another one up just to keep the cycle going
Macy

[Chorus:]
Just put it in the air
Roll up light up
And let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free x2)
Just put it in the air (air, air)
Roll up light up
And let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free x2)

[Verse 2:]
Let me take a swing of this drink so it can help me think right quick
Break down a little bit of this rhymeulent and rap it up in a switch
Shout out to my nigga Greg out there in the A
For sendin me this this pineapple mango blunt power spray
That product right here will knock out any odour it comes in handy
Especially if the popo banana people pull ya ova
They can’t stand me the love puttin
Why you call em the the love puttin
Cause they love puttin our ass in custody
Right now I’m hard
Watching the girls swim runnin through my contacts finna call a bitch to swim in
Abracadabra I don’t know if you notice
Been gettin my money lately my hussle game’s ferocious
You see my new mercedes it’s domeless
Go hard or go home or go homeless
Money in my shoe box not no bank grinding
Either that or my tubes starting selling that dang tied it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Smokin no cookie no pastry you seeing in HD
You niggas too gazy all my niggas is gravy
Hello wavy baby strunt on 360
Blowing on some gas win a filly wan niche
Down Town in the city blowin next to the rollers
I’m still down blowin ain't no slowing in my modem
Easy on the galaxy run around no batteries
When you like the punch you betta know you betta pass to me
Sliding my porsche hotta than torch
Bout that bullshit I’m running up on a nigga porch
Full force that I unleashed lisa
Goons on your squad for a piece a pizza

[Chorus:]
Just put it in the air
Roll up light up
And let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free x2)
Just put it in the air (air, air)
Roll up light up
And let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free x2)
Just put it in the air
Roll up light up
And let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free x2)
Just put it in the air (air, air)
Roll up light up
And let the blunt burn free (blunt burn free x2)
And let the blunt burn free (and let the blunt burn free)[x4]
