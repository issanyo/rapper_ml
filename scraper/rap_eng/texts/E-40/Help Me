[Intro]
Lord, help me (x2)

[Verse 1]
When I was a little young ghetto child I wanted to be comic
Dallas act maybe one day on the sonic
Soaking up game from the Alges drinking gin and tonic
See these streets right here this shit hard
Lost souls equals spirits left, the walking dead
Gruff workers shot at him and shot her instead
Everytime we leave the house we take a chance
Just a couple a obituaries programs
Never make fun of the mentally challenged that ain't the biz
And I was taught to never laugh at disadvantaged kids
Where my real ones at we the last Mohicans
A lot of OGs fell off thank God I’m still breathing
My purpose on this earth your guess is good as mine
When they put me in the dirt Heaven I hope I find
Sit with God and John the Baptist sip some Jesus wine
Everytime I write my rhymes my pen starts to cry
She wanna go to the club and kick it with her homies
But her Daddy is funny she can’t spend  her laundry money
Plus her water bills sky high need a plumber can’t afford to gamble
The cupboard keep running gotta shake the toilet hands
In the ghetto we got all kinds of home remedies and things
If we catch a cold we drink the juice from collard greens
Got a ear ache don’t stress don’t foil reach in the cabinets and grab some sweet oil

[Chorus]
I’m out here in the cold
Feels like nobody knows but can’t they see me
Lord I need some help
I pray today’s the day that one of your angels finally looks down and sees me
Caz I need some help
I’m out here in the cold
Feels like I’m all alone Lord can’t you see me caz I need some help
I need some help Lord
I pray today’s the day that one of your angels finally looks down and sees me
Look down and see me
Caz I need some help
I need some help

[Verse 2]
I got undying niggas and undying hoes turn into foes
I keep selling to many drops to put  dollas
Deal with it and go hard Black on the map to sell out for scraps
3 things that you don’t need to fuck with that’s my family, my bread, and my rap
Do people with deep scars ever get rewards
Why is it that the most real never seem to get their cards
Is my music about all these ways to lose but don’t get hurt
Am I just wasting more time painting pictures with words
There’s a lot a people that know love and but wasn’t even have the time
When they game got boring, why do I keep hearing it’s the first thing they hate you
That they ain't as strong as you, and they not gettin blessed like you do
Get the picture they forget what made love it’s got so easy to betray love
And even tho I haven’t found it I still have a positive mind frame
It’s why I always get one or at least four biscuits I know that I’ve been thru some shit
Seems like I done lost another friend every time my partnas come back home from the Pen
Or has the pen just became  home for them, it’s too many parts to pain
It’s too many parts to pain man

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Heeeehhheeeee, help me (x2)
Make em cry mayne (x5)
Help me, Help me
Teach me, teach me
Forgive me, forgive me
I need some help
Strengthen me, Strengthen me
Help me, Help me
Teach me, teach me
Go head and heal me, give some help
I need you to strengthen me, Strengthen me
Save me
Please save me, bring me my joy back, give me some help
I need you to strengthen me, Strengthen me
Please save me, bring me my joy back, give me some help
Help me, help me
Help me
