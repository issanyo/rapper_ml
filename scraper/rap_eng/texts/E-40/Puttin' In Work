I’m puttin’ in work
Back by popular demand
From the home of the scams
Slip and you’ll get caught up in a jam
Running through money, using hundreds as a fan
Sitting at the table making plans
I'm puttin' in work
Back by popular demand
From the home of the scams
Slip and you’ll get caught up in a jam
Running through money, using hundreds as a fan
Sitting at the table making plans
I'm puttin' in work

[Verse 1: E-40]
Making boss moves
Me and all of my dudes
Living a mainey life
Breaking all the rules
Your money funny like a tickle
We solid, y’all brittle
I came up having nothing
Now slide Forgiato buttons
Chain long as an extension
Car cost a baby mansion
Talking to my bitch
She at the house frying up some fish
Oyster on my wrist
Diamonds dancing, they twinkle, and twitch
Red cup to my lip
Double-fisted, taking hella sips

[Verse 2: E-40]
You liable to see me everywhere like that man from the Marlins
Put some respek on my name like my folks from New Orleans
I ball like a Hoover, I’m quick to call me a Uber
When I get twisted and warped I just might knock me a cougar
This beaty go toady, it make you get up and gig
I came through the back, snuck up in this bitch with my cig
Everybody on me, they love me, keep it a thou’
I’m thorough, not phony, been doing this shit for a while
Big Earl is my homie, been raising me since a child
His music is therapy, make you get up and smile
When I broke it was funny, but honey, look at me now
I’m having my money, I’m feeling good and I’m proud
Tomorrow not promised and then today ain’t fo’ sho’
Give back to my people ‘cause playas don’t keep sco’
This world is amazing, it’s quite an interesting spectacle
This Earth is a circle, it’s full of phonies and messy hoes

[Verse 3: E-40]
Every time I look in the mirror I see a boss
Puffin’ on this here Jack Herer, about to cough
Certified, ain’t never been sissified, I ain’t soft
I’m not a bitch, I get you out up out of there, pay the cost
Batches be on us, they like the way we be thuggin’
Nine times out of ten, it’s a dime and a dozen
I’m going for the win, glad that she ain’t my cousin
Tycoon vodka and a little discussion
Mob the most, coast to coast
Every now and then I like to floss and flamboast
If I ain’t in the studio I’m at the black rodeo
Or at the horse races tycoonin’ in the front row
Or maybe at the high limits table placing my bet
Baccarat, blackjack, craps or roulette
Rooftop parties, mansions and boats
Campaigning like I’m running for governor on a float
