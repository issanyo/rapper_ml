Hey, hey, hey

Fucked up, fucked up!
Ripped, ripped, blisted, blisted

I'm ripped, tequila, vodka and Yak
I'm so ripped that they can't saw me back
Give me some,some limes, some dimes
Who we're at? And watch me go ham, prosciutto!
Welcome to the gin pit, the
It's a line around the corner and it's smacking in this house
Club pack like the Riner brothers air show
How can I qualify, Marshall?
Let me in the side, don't let me in through the back
I'm a boss, I ain't taking off my hat!
I smell like a , I've been smoking since I woke up
Full of that, my eyes the colour of my cup
All eyes on us, we go the hardest
Hell of bachelors, and bottle service sparkling
I'm high as a hippie, I'm style
Patron 'til the lights come out!

Uh, I'm afraid to go in
Party like Memorial Day weekend, weekend
You're hella torn up, drunk
Today my birthday, so I'mma party all month!
They call me,talking landlord out her house
Famous for my work plus, so 
Shipped up like free, clientele and class
Everyday is payday without a dollar..
Uh, I got my team in here
It's hella damn bitches in here
Cliquing and the three musketeers
Making this our year! (Bitch!)
Black boy, black boy, look at me!
Hella guy, like Mr. T
What after I was at, what after party?
