Verse One: E-40

When I was fifteen years old
Straight dope game I was told
I went from, selling pennies of the riders dank-ah (riders dank-ah)
Timin ass think of slangin crank (think of slangin griqua)
Situation critical: phone home, phone home
Talkin on my digital: call phone
Ya seen a boatload of situations, for dangleations
Invalid ghetto pass late ass registrations
Boy I tell you shit is pitiful, damn!
Vocally repentable, dead right!
I try to stay away from artificial (artificial)
Plastic ass (plastic ass), pleather motherfuckin individuals
(Fuckah!!)

Verse Two: Coolio

One lone loco rides away
Into the sunset but, I ain't done yet
Respect yourself and wear your vest
Keep your guard up cause fools be hard up
When you hittin dips better check yo' clips and
Watch the police and the Bloods and the Crips
Anyway you choose got ta pay your dues
Keep one in the chamber cause the shoes always loose
Rubber wheels beat rubber heels anyday
Put the green in your jeans and get the holes out ya halo
Or you can stay broke while your homies is rollin smokes
And sippin yak and smokin dank and tellin jokes, haha

And put yourself in heaven on Earth, before you pass
And exercise yo' game -- exercise yo' game fool

Verse Four: 40 Thevz

Peep game from a young ass, rollin on the one way
Foot to the gas got the indo mixed with hash
Monday through Sunday and all in-between
I fiend for my paper, my fed, and my green
Ain't no busters or no suckers on my team or in my mattress
Just call me the Pimp
And you can call me the Rat
Watch my feet hit the tracks it, ain't no lookin back
I'm on a mission tryin to put my fuckin click on the map
But these niggas don't know the half
Runnin with riff raff but I got some game for your bitch ass
Cause your game is weaker than an anorexic
I exercised my game until I had my game perfected
I wrote the game on paper then I put the game on record
You better check it nigga don't you every disrespect it
