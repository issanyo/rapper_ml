[Hook x2]
We outchea, and we looking for a payday
Bitch I go in, no play play
Turn down for what, no way-ay
So drunk I need to check into an AA

[Bridge]
Turn up or burn up
Turn up or burn up
Turn up or burn up
Turn up or burn up
Turn up or burn up

[Verse 1: E-40]
At first my capital was disintegrating but now it's escalating
In my neck of the woods on my side of the earth we out here cheddar chasing
Hustling and rushing and racing, bay niggas ain't got no patience
Fresh out of jail, he right back in and serving yell to patrons
I could pull a botch if my breath stank
In a beat up dented bucket on an empty tank
Out here we nervous and smirking [?] and give you the service
Out here it's hustle and murders be careful if you a tourist
Hyperspace and sedated love to get wasted and faded
Levitated, elated, delated eyes dilated
Loaded like a Mossberg jar full of herb
If you want beef then I'll bring a herd
You can't spell West without the E (Who you put that on?)
I put that on me
I'm crispy like Panko, monitor on my ankle
Real nigga like Django, I put my foot in yo anal

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
First off fuck a hater with a sick dick
Real niggas over here won't shit switch
In the scraper tryna find me a quick lick
Skate through the set I fuck around and do a kick flip
Turn up a nigga do the damn thang
I might buy U-Haul tryna move the damn things
I can't play with you can't lay with you
That's on my mama I'm gone
Talking about fuck haters we touch paper nigga go hard or go home
Early morning I be on it like I want it nigga
Choppa loaded aim it right at my opponent nigga
Red dot a head shot'll be a bonus nigga
Inglewood to the bay, this west side Killafornia nigga
Soo woo!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Problem]
Whaaaat?
What the bloodclot be
This here pipe what you might wan see
This here flight joint filled with OG
And your girlfriend puss can't go a day without me (whaaaaaaaaat!)
Problem, money Daytona check the aroma
Good on the corner hunter persona put pussies in comas
You thick as [?] good as granola
Hold up the phone I told you I'm on you like million dollar [?]
Hot boy come take notes
Your girl wanna fuck and I'm a let her like notes
Envelope [?] hit her from the back
Smoked me a joint then dipped off
You're fucking with a mack!
