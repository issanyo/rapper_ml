[Verse 1 - TeeCee4800]
I’ve got to go
It’s TeeCee48
Come in, come this way
You know I keep it straight
Smoked more than a eight
[?] all I’m paid
Keep my niggas on the payroll
Come and put it on me
Show me you deserve a say so
Ooh that booty fat, pretty face, you my main squeeze
And you know to never keep that burner on the safety
Tally got the tooly tooly tooly and got bankrolls
Tally fucked a lot of bitches but I never let them hoes
Must be doin’ somethin’ right a nigga feelin’ fave
Got me callin’ in, checkin’ in, like I’m on vacation
Like what you sayin’? Never did that
I’m feelin’ good, got my shit back
You know I’m livin’, forgive my sinnin’
You know if I want it, I’m a go get it
Ridin’ ‘round the city, just me and you girl

[Chorus - TeeCee4800]
Main bitch, got me like aah
Everytime I see it girl I’m like ooh
Hit it quick and little kiss I’ve got to go
I’ve got to go
Main bitch, got me like aah
Everytime I see it girl I’m like ooh
Hit it quick and little kiss I’ve got to go
I’ve got to go

[Verse 2 - E-40]
Smokin’ this dank, havin’ my bank
Gettin’ my bread, stackin’ my franks
Gucci my move, but can’t let them ruin it
Haters keep hatin’ ‘cause me and you doin’ it
Me and you doin’ it
Me and you doin’ it
Haters keep hatin’ ‘cause me and you doin’ it
Money I’m makin’ and business is boomin’
I will be thinkin’, I’m really that [?]
We came from the bottom now we at the top
You still by my side and you wasn’t on block
Let me use your ride when it’s time to go cop
If we see a cop hide the dope in your twat
Watch out for [?] snitches and knots
We [?], we [?]
We ownin’ the club little smoke in the spot
Let me play you my new shit you can pass me the ox

[Chorus - TeeCee4800]
Main bitch, got me like aah
Everytime I see it girl I’m like ooh
Hit it quick and little kiss I’ve got to go
I’ve got to go
Main bitch, got me like aah
Everytime I see it girl I’m like ooh
Hit it quick and little kiss I’ve got to go
I’ve got to go

[Verse 3 - Wiz Khalifa]
Damn, she know I’m the man
She know I’m the one that get them grands
She know I’m the one that go on the road to fill up all them stands
She the one that get diamonds on hand
Now we flyin’ again and you right there beside me
Say you want me down when I need you girl you gon’ ride for me, you dig?
You go hard for the kid
Pull up in the whip that they can’t even believe I started, but I did
I’m rockin’ nice sized diamonds, them as big ass stones
Tryin’a take you to my crib, that’s a big ass home
Niggas sayin’, they’re like, where’s that’s a bold faced lie
They don’t stack their money up and they don’t get fly
They don’t go and cop shit people don’t even buy
Don’t show up to the spot drunk and already high
And we can leave the club later
Roll this weed up now but make sure that we fuck later

[Chorus - TeeCee4800]
Main bitch, got me like aah
Everytime I see it girl I’m like ooh
Hit it quick and little kiss I’ve got to go
I’ve got to go
Main bitch, got me like aah
Everytime I see it girl I’m like ooh
Hit it quick and little kiss I’ve got to go
I’ve got to go
