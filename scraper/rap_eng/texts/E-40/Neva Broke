Hey, what's up my nigga
Check this out you been listenin' for awhile
Why don't you tell these niggas
What they really thinkin' about
When be locked d-in-own {down}

[Verse 1]
During my stay all I talked about was when I touch down
I'mma go buy me a tech with my bitches welfare check
And if I hurt her feelings who gives a fuck
I'm out for myself, bout to make me a smooth come-up
I keep it on the under in a closet on the hush hush
On my way to victories downtown surplus
To get a blend aqua windbreaker
To match blue latchin' vendeta
Scadalism, that's what I'm majorin' in
Yeah, murderism I'm doin' niggas in
So give up the goods my nogga
Remember me, I used to be your pa-not-na (partner)
But fuck ya, I'm jealous and I hate ya fuckin' guts
I got it in me cause ya clockin' do-do bucks
Break yourself, nigga, quarters, pennies, rings, chains
I'm takin ya car, too, nigga get out, you sittin on them thangs
Prepare for the jack if ya sellin' coke
As long as I got me a strap nigga, I'm never broke

As long as I got me a strap, I'm never broke

[Verse 2]
Found the nigga car at the mall on bricks
Beat strip, beat tip fucked him like a bitch
I'm that nigga to hate playas
A playa hater starvin' like Somalia
You got some yola?
Cause I'm right back chokin' again
Chokin' mo' now than I did before I went in
Tomorrow I got to go take a piss test for real
I'm tryin' to clean out my system with stay clean and golden seals
But I'm gon' be late, I'm on vacation
Three weeks is too early for me to go back on a violation
Fuck my P.O. I need some M-O
N-E-Y so I can get high and kick in this nigga's door
It's four in the morning I'm on a mission peep
The best time to catch a nigga in his sleep
Wake ya ass motherfucker I know ya rich
Tell me where the fuck is your scratch or else I'mma bust ya bitch
Dude didn't agree so I tied him up
And made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke

Dude didn't agree so I tied him up
Then I made him watch me poke her, I'm never broke
I'm never broke

[Verse 3]
Baby crevice was tight like a pair of vice grips
I looked at potna and said "You must got a little dick"
Havin' fits, yeah he was cryin' like a toddler
Nigga couldn't stand hearin baby scream and holler
I said "You got one mo' time my nigga, where is the mail?"
He said "It's in the den, right hand corner, top vent"
Now, folks, remember that I'm scandalous and I'm anti-fuckless
I carry diseases such as herpes and nut pluckers
Nutted in the bitch, kissed her on her lips
Made her get up and suck a little of my dick
The bitch had her some game though
Ya know she deep throated my pickle...and oh
I dropped my strap like a sucker would
She said "How does it feel" I said "Good"
She said "You know this ain't weather to mix business with pleasure"
I said "I know this ain't the weather to mix business with pleasure"
She said You know this ain't the weather to mix business with pleasure
Shit, she tried to bite off my pecker
Hell breaks loose, I'm hecka juiced, and that's the truth
Reach back as far as I can go and knock the shit out the ho
Picked up my tech n-up (up) off the grin-ound (ground)
Pistol whipped potna, tied up sittin' d-in-own {down}
I need a flathead screwdriver but a butter knife'll do
To the vent I went to collect my revenue
Struck out the side as if I was Dave Stewart
Hopped in my hoo-ride made a left on Newark
Through the dark alleys black this black that
As long as I got me a strap look I'm never broke, yeah

I'm never broke

[Talking]
Oh I see
So what you're saying is that a pillsbury Is something like an investment
Keep your revenues up to par
And a pillsbury is a strap

Precisely that's how motherfuckers make them fat g-in-et backs {get-backs}
See I'm way respected in the rap industry
Cause I skip, spit that real-life type shit
Feel it, so let's separate the true from the false
The punk from the tardy
And the motherfuckin' good from the naughty
