[Verse 1: Wale]
I got somethin' new to wear, I'm gonna nothin' worse
See the fool over here exposin' [?]
I'm a rockstar nigga, [?] for the killa
Somehow I be dressin' like [?] exclusive
You a real lame nigga, I'm a modern day poet
Dark skinned Steph Curry man I got your bae with me
Shout out to Oakland all the bosses with me
Bands birkin' shawty, [?] to strip
Ball hard my nigga like Dre [?] with it
Shout out to Avery and Jones, I'm 'bout to barbecue
I'm with Avery Jones, so I'm a rockafella
It's all the bosses with it, so all the dreams are finished

[Verse 2: Adrian Marcel]
Even you know me, you know 'bout my WAM
Don't call me if it ain't about WAM
Rolling through the city and I stay with my WAM
Favorite color green, blame it on WAM
Two thousands dollars jeans and you know that my pocket's full of WAM
And your girl coming back to the crib so she get respect
Her and her friend
I wanna go to the crib like right now
So I can show her how a young nigga live

[Hook: Adrian Marcel]
I be getting paid, all day (all day)
Rolling up and counting money
Everybody say "Hey!", if you in love with weed and money
If you in love with weed and money, if you in love with weed and money
If you in love with weed and money, said I'm in love with weed and money

[Verse 3: Adrian Marcel]
Niggas think I'm Hollywood if I don't take a photo
Niggas think they poppin' more and me I take they hoe, though
Getting more [?], no, it's where I just do me
Plus I got that shit, that's why they leaving with me

[Hook: Adrian Marcel]
I be getting paid, all day (all day)
Rolling up and counting money
Everybody say "Hey!", if you in love with weed and money
If you in love with weed and money, if you in love with weed and money
If you in love with weed and money, said I'm in love with weed and money

[Verse 4: E-40]
E-40, ugh
15 hundred dollar shoes, 2 thousand dollar jeans
Used to be broke, but now a nigga have a thing
Used to [?] coke, but then I sold my triple beam
Look at my rope, yellow diamonds in my cuban link
I got the mouth piece of a ballitician
Can see through a sucker without an x-ray vision
All my life I've been polished, act like you know
You better find me in the [?]
[?], show 'em love
Been having money since Mufasa was in cut
Shout out to [?] liquor store at [?] side
And all my folks in the bike clubs, they ride

[Hook: Adrian Marcel]
I be getting paid, all day
Rolling up and counting money
Everybody say "Hey!", if you in love with weed and money
If you in love with weed and money, if you in love with weed and money
If you in love with weed and money, said I'm in love with weed and money
