[Intro: Mistah F.A.B.]
Woooo, shit
Nigga, they done let Fabby Davis out
Fabby Davis like Buddy Love
Mistah Fabby on that Professor club shit
It's Fabby Davis!

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
When I'm yokin' down the strip, don't trip
Brody, I don't hear shit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this whip
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
When it hit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this bitch
When I'm yokin' down the strip, don't trip
Brody, I don't hear shit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
When I'm lit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
And it hit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this bitch

[Verse 1: Mistah F.A.B.]
6-6-5-9, 12 10s in the trunk
Wake the whole neighborhood up when I turn it up
I was being cool, niggas want me to turn it up
That brand new mob shit, nigga better turn it up
Knock it, yoke it, dip it and side
Niggas better be cool, my nigga's dippin' and slidin'
Dip, yrrrk, cut the bitch off, hit a right at the corner
Three deep in the car man, blowin' marijuana
On that hot shit, I should be ashamed of myself
Fabby Davis made me do it, put the blame on myself
Never put the hammer up, or that thang on the shelf
I don't need no shooters, nigga, I'll bang 'em myself
Bang-bang, Yosemite Sam, goddam
And a Dope E.R.A. havin' knock many have slammed
I'll jam on a nigga like NBA
And pass on a broke bitch like Courvoisier

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
When I'm yokin' down the strip, don't trip
Brody, I don't hear shit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this whip
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
When it hit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this bitch
When I'm yokin' down the strip, don't trip
Brody, I don't hear shit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
When I'm lit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
And it hit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this bitch

[Verse 2: IAmSu!]
Fabby, shit go stupid, maney
Hyphy spirit, can't contain it
Music mothafuckin' loud
Do a show then I jump up in the crowd
And I only smoke mothafuckin' loud, when it hit
I be higher than a mothafuckin' cloud, in this bitch
Ice chang-a-lang-a-lang-a-lang-a-langin', blingin' on a dog whore
Oh-rang-a-rang-a-tang-a-tang-a, hit her with that king cobra
Still 2006 bitch, we ain't over, we ain't over
We been smokin' weed, we ain't sober, gentrifyin', we ain't goin
Nowhere, it's not fair, like network, I go there
And if she on my good side, I might take her to Bay Fair
[?]
I got her off of more than one plural for the boy
Foreva Afta Bread like F.A.B. in this bitch
The hottest in the game, that's unanimous bitch

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
When I'm yokin' down the strip, don't trip
Brody, I don't hear shit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this whip
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
When it hit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this bitch
When I'm yokin' down the strip, don't trip
Brody, I don't hear shit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
When I'm lit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
And it hit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this bitch

[Verse 3: E-40]
Either way, Johnny Law gonna pull me over (over)
Either because I was knockin' or because I ain't ever sober (sober)
I get a ticket every week from my beat (beat)
Prohibitin' everyone in my neighborhood from sleep
Y-y-yoke, motor mount losin' screws
454 engine about to jump out the roof
My muscle car be liftin' weights (weights), it's stronger than ever
Who wanna race (race)?  For pink slips or cheddar?
If she knew better, she'd do better, that's what I told the broad (told the broad)
When I was comin' up outta the liquor store buyin' alcohol (alcohol)
She was thinkin' [?] big fat ass and all (ass and all)
I could tell by the way she was lookin' she wanted to give me the drawers (give me the drawers)
High [?] amplified, mobile audio
Trunk hittin' hard like Mayweather and Paccio
Stupidious knock (knock), uncalled for
Seven-deuce Cutlass with the stick in the floor
Biatch!

[Chorus: Mistah F.A.B.]
When I'm yokin' down the strip, don't trip
Brody, I don't hear shit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this whip
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
When it hit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this bitch
When I'm yokin' down the strip, don't trip
Brody, I don't hear shit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
When I'm lit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
And it hit
'Cause the music's so mothafuckin' loud
In this bitch

[Outro: Mistah F.A.B.]
Ahhh, shit
