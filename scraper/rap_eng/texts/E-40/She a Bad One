[Hook: Red Cafe] x3
Bad bitch alert
Bad bitch alert
Bad bitch alert
Bad bitch alert, oh yeah
She a bad one, oh yeah
She a bad one

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Down girl from the city, she a bad one
Ass on G-wagon, she with the action
Told me always call her nasty, Ms. Jackson
Everything designer, she with the fashion
Oh yeah, oh, she about her bank rolls
Slim thick, oh, I need a sample
She smart.... not just a pretty face
Make it pop, earthquake, girl you my taste
Oh yeah, oh, she a lady boss
Machiavelli, oh, I'm an outlaw
Most wanted, oh, you on my hitlist
Putting in work on your fitness
I'm fucking with you

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
In the ass department that girl a heavyweight
Watch it dip low, then it levitate
Sh-Shawty hop up on a pole then she demonstrate
I bet you never guess the bands that it generate
Oh, girl you got a whooooole lot
Sitting in them leggings, how you carry that around?
You 'gon get a whooooole lot
Bad bitch alert, she got a million dollar box
Go on and keep your glass full, motivate the swerve
I'ma need a Rolls Royce to handle them curves, oh
Oh yeah, bad one, she got the boomerang
When they turn to stalkers, she on a newer thing

[Verse 3: E-40]
Lady boss, hella pretty
I bet that pussy slap, thick like she from Mississippi
Bitch hella bad, nipples poking out her shirt
They hella mad, they wanna fight her cuz they hurt
Jealous house, borrowing they girlfriend's clothes
New panty hose, mad cuz they ain't have to shove
Centerfolds, booty cheeks a stripper pole
Deci-mals, tricking niggas throw some more
Sophisticated, she a delta
Skee-wee, highly educated
See me, you know them niggas hating
Bad bitch alert, the gang celebrated
