Slide slide slide

[Chorus]
How can I do you do you do you
Well I got you
I want to rock you till you till you
Want to sit with me
I say do you do you and to try with me
Do you do you want a song with me
Do you do you do you
I say do you do you do you
Oh yea do you do you do you
Do you do you do you

[Verse 2]
Uh long money man that’s all I’m after
I’m a big deal man I’m a factor
California waved that’s all I surf
Party like a rock I stay dope
Yea and she know I’m that
White girl with a booty like she black black
It’s worth a slap slap
Pull up in the Benz G wag
You know I’m going to try put you out like a nap
I’m the man and you know all these fuck  boys hate it
Life deal me a crack and I’m going to play it
She got me harder as a hammer
She said that I’m her steely hammer
Girl all like a channel I got my hands on her
I got the gift of dab but the master of my craft
I know I got game from the way I wear my beetle cap
I’’m doing my thing although you never see me
We on the slow train what you know about that

[Chorus]
How can I do you do you do you
Do you want to rock with me
Do you do you
Do you want to sit with me
Do you do you
Do you want to rock with me
Do you do you
Do you want to sit with me
Do you do you
Do you want to drink with me
Do you do you
Do you want a song with me
Do you
What you know about that let’s ride
