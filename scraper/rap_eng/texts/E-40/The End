[Intro: Holy Bible (KJV) - Revelation 1:7-8]
Revelation 1:7: Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him

Revelation 1:8: I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty

[Intro: E-40]
Our goal was to get out the ghetto
Raised up on the soil
But we'll never forget the ghetto
Never forget it

[Verse 1: E-40]
This music, my current mood
Reminiscin' and thinkin' about my dude (RIP)
He was a good dude
Every time I ran into him I'll say, "fool hecka cool"

Circumstances and penitentiary chances
Been a block monster since the first day of school
Nowadays seem like everybody pack a stick
Nine times outta ten it be a brotha you grew up with

That'll pluck you in yo' dome
Do it with they team or do it all alone
I hope he went to space cause that's a much better place
I hope he said his grace, make it into Heaven's gates

To this day it bothers me
Backwards ball, no life insurance policy
Real spill 2-0-1
Pass the hat around for the funeral fund

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]
If it's a easy way to live, I ain't never noticed
If it's a damn for me to give, I ain't never wanted
All I gotta do, regardless
God still smiles on the heartless
Cause in the middle of the city, ain't no such thing as fear
And I can see the end from here

[Verse 2: E-40]
I keep askin' myself, "what is it gon' take for me to get further in this world?"
What I gotta do? Cause I refuse to sell Satan my soul
He a hater, I keep my faith in the Creator
Got angels watchin' me, protect me from the undertaker

I'm tryin' to make things right before I meet my maker
I worship the Bible, Jesus Christ my savior
Show me where in the Good Book say I can't smoke a Taylor
Even when I'm drinkin', I be perkin', sayin' my prayers

I spit it from the heart with my right hand on my chest
Every time I take a breath, I know I'm blessed
Some of the people that's rich hecka depressed
Some of the people that's poor don't ever stress

You only live once, I think I heard 'em say
And you only die once, my grandpa used to say
Love and hug ya friends and next of kin
Cause you never know when it's gon' be the end

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]

[Bridge: Holy Bible (KJV) - 2 Peter 3:10-12]
2 Peter 3:10: But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up

2 Peter 3:11: Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and godliness

2 Peter 3:12: Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?

[Chorus: Krizz Kaliko]

[Outro: Holy Bible (KJV) - 2 Peter 3:13-14]
2 Peter 3:13: Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness

(God still smiles on the heartless)

2 Peter 3:14: Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be diligent that ye may be found of him in peace

(I can see the end from here)
