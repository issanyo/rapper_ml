[Pre-Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
I rolled the weed up to relieve mine (Mine)
If you're too high, I’m three high (Three high)
Papa gave me game when I was knee-high (Knee-high)
Now when they see me outside they like

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
Sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
Sprinkle me, mayne
Sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
Sprinkle me, mayne
They be like sprinkle me (Sprinkle)
Sprinkle me, mayne
Sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
Sprinkle me, mayne

[Verse 1: Rexx Life Raj]
Look, sprinkle me
Tryna get it straight like it was wrinkly (Ohh)
Still tryna find myself so how could I care what you think of me?
I've leveled up on niggas, I'm now on another frequency
You niggas coonin’ out for the internet, have some decency
This year, the new pair, snake stripe match the regency (Aye)
Top floor where the white people be and did that legally
Buildin' business up wit' the homies then split it evenly
Yeah, one half human, one half deity
Yeah, still lovin' thinkin' that I'm alright (That I'm alright)
Uh, pop a Addy, it'll be a long night (Be a long night)
I got it from the thrift
Bro it ain’t Off-White (It ain’t Off-White nigga)
Fuck I look like I'm wearin’ Off-White? (Look like, look like)
Uh, I wear my own shit 'cause I own it, yeah
Make it, flip it then go buy some more shit, yeah (Yeah)
Nigga don't ask me what I'm smokin’ (What I'm smokin')
'Cause you can't hit my blunt if you ain't roll shit no

[Pre-Chorus: Rexx Life Raj]
I rolled the weed up to relieve mine (Mine)
If you're too high, I'm three high (Three high)
Papa gave me game when I was knee-high (Knee-high)
Now when they see me outside they like

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj & E-40]
Sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
Sprinkle me, mayne
Sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
Sprinkle me, mayne
They be like sprinkle me (Sprinkle)
(It it my turn yet?)
Sprinkle me, mayne
Sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
(Let the Counselor speak)
Sprinkle me, mayne

[Verse 2: E-40]
I'm sick wid it, no injury
I don't condone sucker-ism, misery love company
I like to mind my own business, don't fool wit' fuckery
You can play with me if you want, it's gon' get ugly
Born and raised in the smudge
Flick-flickin' and flippin' juugs
Where the innocent ain't so innocent
And the guilty ain't so guilty
None of my pockets is empty
I've been investin' in realty
All of my OG's laced me
All of my OG's sprinkled me
I was seeded and breeded straight up out the gravel
Where they believe in beef, no cattle
Gotta be trained to go, not fragile
Ain't no more toe-to-toe, it's tactical
I'll go bad on a batch if I have to, if she disrespect (Disrespect)
If she choose up, that's the game
I'll get another chick (Another chick)
I won't be boo'd up wit' a slut
Mayne, I ain't cuffin' it (Cuffin' it)
I come from the game, mayne, I'm cut from it (I'm cut from it)
Bitch!

[Bridge: Rexx Life Raj]
We're not trippin' off the time (Time)
It disappears when we're here (We're here)
Uh, so I'm down to catch a vibe if you will (If you will)
Ay, ay
We're not trippin' off the time (Time)
It disappears when we're here (We're here)
And I'm down to catch a vibe if you will (If you will)
Ay, ay

[Pre-Chorus: Rexx Life Raj & (E-40)]
I rolled the weed up to relieve mine (Relieve mine)
If you're too high, I'm three high (Three high)
Poppa gave me game when I was knee-high (Knee-high)
Now when they see me outside they like

[Chorus: Rexx Life Raj & (E-40)]
Sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
Sprinkle me, mayne (Sprinkle me, mayne)
Sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
Sprinkle me, mayne (Sprinkle me, mayne)
They be like sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
Sprinkle me, mayne (Sprinkle me, mayne)
Sprinkle me (Sprinkle me)
Sprinkle me, mayne (Sprinkle me, mayne)
