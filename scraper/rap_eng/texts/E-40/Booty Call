[Intro: Mikl]
Oh baby girl, you got me so mixed up inside
I don't know if I can't handle this
So baby, tell me what I gotta do to make it right
I promise I'm not scandalous

[Hook: Se7en & Mikl]
I just want a booty call
Will you be my booty call?
Making you my booty call
Now drop those panties to the floor [x2]

[Verse 1: Se7en]
Nasty girls know me; no love
Call your girl to give me some
Drop it girl, go take it back
I'll take you to the candy shack
Like Jolly Ranchers, Sugar Daddys
Chocolate-covered booty panties
Lots of women in my Cadi
It's gonna get a little nasty

[Verse 2: E-40]
Let's go start another party, party
Smoke a little broccoli and get naughty, naught
Pop a few drinks and get sloppy, sloppy
Drunk, crunk; girl, you got a big, old donk, donk
Look at all the junk in your trunk, trunk
I like the way your lady lumps, lumps looking in those pants
I know a some dudes that'll give you all they money if you dance

[Bridge: Se7en]
Get nasty, girls, get nasty [x3]
And shake it like chocolate milk

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Mikl]
Oh baby girl, I seen your photos on MySpace
You look so beautiful
So what I gotta do to take you to my place?
So you can be my booty call

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Se7en]
Now drop it, girl, go shake that ass
I wanna see you make it clap
Like clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Oh yeah, she knows the way I want it
Gucci boots with Apple Bottoms
Look at you, you want my body
Let's go start another party

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Outro: Mikl & (Se7en)]
Be my booty call
(You can be my booty call)
