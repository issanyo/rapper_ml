[Talking: Guy]
Check it out potna
I don't wanna see nobody out here from 10 to 2
You see dude right there, you see dude right there
We a lay something down out here mane
I'm getting money out here mane this me
And ain't goin nobody goin run me outta here mane
I got this late night shift

[Hook: E-40]
I'm over the stove (stove)
If this rap shit don't work man I'm tellin' ya
I'm over the stove (stove)
Saying I'm just saying I ain't playin'
I'm over the stove (stove)
If this rap shit don't work man I'm tellin' ya
I'm over the stove (stove)
Saying I'm just saying I ain't playin'
I'm over the stove

[Verse 1:]
I'm in this rap game dope game tired pushing cocaine
Hoping I'm a blow mane one day someday
Suckers in my mix mane he say she say
Dress up like a bitch mane all day errday
Selling promethazine hopping weed crystal meth and bricks
Independent rappers dealing with radio politics
After parties merchandises shows and verse licks
Internet and type of twitting try'na strike ya rich
Fussing with my broad cause I ain't got a jaw
I ain't hittin' them draws she calling me a dog
Grabbing and complaining like she goin through menopause
Breaking out my window for scratching up my calls
I ain't got time for this shit I'm way to silent for this
I got money to get I'm bout to find this bitch
I'm on parole, the government got my soul they want me back in the beam
To shoot a practice scoop the toilet bowl
BEOTCH!

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Over the stove in the kitchen cooking cha cha
With a pickle jar and a pot of boiling watta
Add a smiting west and a 30 ground chabba
Man I like a nigga who lode it down with this pow pow
I can do whatever I got to do to make it through
Cause if this rap shit don't work mane I'm telling you
I got mouths to feed filthy and hella bills to pay
And I be legal myself my nigga this nigga on his way
And ain't nobody goin put my hustle to a holt
I'm try'na climb up the rope and were going way up to the top
I got bars for days I'm dope in the studio line stump
Can't let em sink my boat because they'll jealousy a plot
I'm hella hungry and I'm starving and I'm thirsty
Pimpin' my money so funny it's telling jokes about me
If I ever catch a brick I'll buy a real-itive
I want the fame the cars the feddy and the jewelry
BEOTCH!

[Hook]

[Bridge:]
I'm over the stove
I graduated from a sipper to a burden
I'm over the stove
I can't talk right now my grandma's hands dirty
I'm over the stove

[Verse 3:]
I'm a one dollar near fanalited hopefully one day in the future I'm a be a cash cow
Kick back and watch my money pile
But until that day arrives I'm a hustle till I rise till I blossom
And in the back in they mind they know that I'm a problem
And once I get on this snow man I'm a stay on my birthmark
Long as I play my position to play my part, I'm smart
And I'm a stick with the slang ward that I had befoe, if I make it
Fuck a video ho she was down when I was foe, can't fake it
I been rapping my ass off man I'm a mess, a mess
When I gone they goin be saying I was the best, the best
That ever did it and got away with it, living a halfway with it
In and out like the burgers
See the po-po will let'chu walk wherever as long as it's no murder
Long as it's no witness
Keep a low profile stay lowkey they goin get off in yo business
Fake it till I make it, man I ain't even got krump
If I look like I got some money ain't nobody goin wanna give me none
BEETCH!

[Hook]

I'll steal when I arrive (over the stove)
If they don't give my ass a job (over the stove)
I'll advice street knowledge (over the stove)
If they don't slip my ass to college (over the stove)
I'm try'na stay focused (over the stove)
But I got the eviction notice (over the stove)
I'm a do a nigga in (over the stove)
If I don't get these spins (BITCH!)
BITCH!
