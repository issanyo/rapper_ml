[Intro: Lyrics Born]
Well if you must to do a remix, this is the way it's got to be done. Lyrics Born, E-40, Casual baby. Oooh!

[Hook: Lyrics Born] {x4}
Callin' out to all area crew
We 'gon make this shit happen right here right now

[Verse One: E-40]
I pimp my pen corners, I get high like a rocket
Me and my friends we off the gin and you can't stop it
I can't call it, I guess I'm just a ballaholic mayne
Ridin' on propellers, custom coated candy paint
My speakers [?] I pull rank
Fat bank take little bank
Haters want to see the 40 Water's ship sank
I'ma ride the wave and stay paid and get laid
[?] cradle to the grave
If this was a pack of playing cards I'd be a spade
Stick to the script like a big ol' gumbo pot on my stove
But I ain't cookin' no [?] stew, I'm cookin' my yo yo
Fo' sho' tho'
Watering my grass and make it grow tho'
Never changing my clothes, livin' like a hobo
24-7 and mo'
Stand on my p's and my toes
Standing in front of the sto'
Drinkin' malt liquor 4-0's
Tryin' to shine like a diamond and glow
Servin' my package of [?]
Smokin' and coughin' and chokin', puffin' on purple

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Casual]
Now let me hop up on this one and get acclimated
We come together how the Wonder Twins activated
Happily livin' and we gettin' money calculated
Rappers, I cut 'em up, leave 'em faded and decapitated
I don't need no ridiculous doe, you cats tickle me so
I'm kickin' this flow so niggas will know
Casual wear a suit to confuse the cops
And bring the gun shots to your beautiful blocks
Better stay in your cubicle hops
Don't give up your day
Cats better remember I'm not new to this partna
Sippin' on this brew and this vodka
Baby girl fly like a stewardess, knock her
Oooh
Cause the way she jockin' I don't want her
She hopped on the gators like the Crocodile Hunter
The Bay Area, weight carriers will break barriers
Cas', Lyrics Born and 40

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Lyrics Born]
Freedom's what I need when I get to flowin'
Better ease up son 'bout to scuff my [?]
With my feet up on the sofa with my tenderoni
Beat up is really how your shit is lookin' homie
A plus is the grade that they puffin' on
You better pay up, when you see me at your window knockin'
Raise up in this function
Let me ask y'all somethin'
Straight up, is the Bay up in this motherfucker? (Hell yeah!)
Whoo ha, that's what all my women sayin'
Whoo ha, even women in they middle ages
[?], wild child at your dinner table
Whoo ha, [?]
Who dat?
L.B., Cas' and Forty Water
Baby true dat, hope we never make a song together
It's too bad, all y'all gon' have to up the offer
Who wack? Cause you can't face the [?] daughter

[Hook]

People are you ready?
Let's start the show
Let's start the show
Don't worry about the present day
They can't stop the...
