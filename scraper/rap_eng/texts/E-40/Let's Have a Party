[Verse 1: E-40]
All I smell is tree
Patrón vodka, Landy, and Louis 1-3
A bunch of PYTs
Pretty Young Things, with grown woman bodies
Everybody getting loud (What else?)
We left our pistols at home
Tonight is a good night (What about it?)
All I wanna do is get dome
Right now I’m hella stoned
But I ain’t alone
Everybody feeling right
No shootouts or fist fights, not a hater in sight
Holy Toledo, who is that over there sipping that mojito?
She got an ass like her auntie
I used to beat it back in ‘93

[Hook: Knotch]
Let’s have a party
Let’s go dumb and retarded
Silver Patrón and Bacardi
Let’s have a party
‘Cause I wanna see her back it up
Yeah, I wanna see her back it up
Let’s have a party
We don’t really give a hoot
And we don’t really give a what
Let’s have a party
And turn up ‘til 6 in the morning
Let’s have a, let’s have a party
Let’s have a party

[Verse 2: Cousin Fik]
Let’s have a party, let’s get it started
I’ll bring Bacardi, we go retarded
She don’t look old enough, then she get carded
ID says 22, her name was Margaret
She works in Target but she go the hardest
‘Cause she got a stripper pole in her apartment
Codeine got a nigga moving lethargic
Sick Wid It rider, but I ain’t car sick
Party don’t stop ‘til 6 in the morning
Never been a skeleton but I’m still bonin’
Everything choosing, I beat her ‘til I bruise it
Gold ticket movement, you know I’m finna use it
We got the pretty chicks throwing up
So you know the party going up
And may the night end in peace, no beef
‘Cause I’m trying to get top, no teeth

[Hook: Knotch]
Let’s have a party
Let’s go dumb and retarded
Silver Patrón and Bacardi
Let’s have a party
‘Cause I wanna see her back it up
Yeah, I wanna see her back it up
Let’s have a party
We don’t really give a hoot
And we don’t really give a what
Let’s have a party
And turn up ‘til 6 in the morning
Let’s have a, let’s have a party
Let’s have a party

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
This is how it’s s’posed to be
Fighting and shooting makes the hoes leave
I’ve seen way too many that’s tight
I’m tryna fuck by the end of the night
I wanna fuck her all night (And do what?)
Cum in her face, then I’m gone (Skeet)
So if she ain’t gon’ get it on
She need to take her dead ass home (BITCH!)
We celebratin’, get naked
25 years selling independent records
We having fun on this album
A lot of girls at the party, you can count ‘em
You know I knocked a few, we just loungin’
Look around, everybody clownin’
Baby girl, she ain’t yours or mine
I don’t wanna fight, let’s just have a good time

[Hook: Knotch]
Let’s have a party
Let’s go dumb and retarded
Silver Patrón and Bacardi
Let’s have a party
‘Cause I wanna see her back it up
Yeah, I wanna see her back it up
Let’s have a party
We don’t really give a hoot
And we don’t really give a what
Let’s have a party
And turn up ‘til 6 in the morning
Let’s have a, let’s have a party
Let’s have a party
