[Chorus:]
I’m so high, so high think I can fly  (touch the sky)
Bought ma bread, so dem foe touched in tha head

Burnt (fried), twisted (fried)
Out there (fried), finished (fried)
Through (fried), gone (fried)
Snapped (fried), stound (fried)
Burnt (fried), twisted (fried)
Out there (fried), finished (fried)
Through (fried), gone (fried)
Snapped (fried), stound (fried)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Tonight I’m bout to be sloppy, outta ma mind an ma body
Man ima find me a hottie, up in da club in tha party
I’m off this landi and property, she off da rum and bacardi
Lil mami a freaky an naughty, body like rubby d body
Say girl ma money don’t be trippin' babe, but I’m gon’ be trippin'
And da bae that a stay wit me all up in that pimpin'
She want me to wife her but I don’t love her I like her
And not only dat, but I got 2 just like her
I’m a baller, a grinder, on ma way to da top a da climber, for real
Cloud be, you can tell dat about ma meal
I can wipe da sweat off ma face wit a dollar bill
On a major scale, gettin' gouda and havin' scrit

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Hot fizz grease, ain’t no touchin' this beast
Spits heat, listen, fixing to get treats on this beat
Watch Tech, he’s a hawk’s nest
Poppin' pillips, say som’n silly like wasps nests
When you fried it sounds weird mayne
We're sane, but we actin' insane, but packing pure game
The tears came that’s something hears fame
Year's strange, get lyrics playing, they don't fear brains
40 water they can't touch us like rapping holly water
I know we caught a show, but he don't know we flow we other
Some know we hotta, in the club just don't be part a looks
He got a token with thada like Pac with no K dollar

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: E-40]
Ma elevator don’t go all d way to da top
I’m couple beers short of a fuckin keg
I got a few screws loose, I ain’t playin wid a full deck
I be extrad out talking hella loud
I'm too turned up mayne am hella wide
Fried, gone in d head, out there
These womens in gowns thought that i was scared now we outta here
Money don’t make me, I make money
Me an a couple a ma crash dummies bar none but at the bar son
But at the bar cranapple juice with keto black
Vodka still popping my collar the way i really act (really act)
But it ain’t really an act it’s a fact
Real dudes make real moves, these dudes too little to fit ma shoes

[Chorus]
