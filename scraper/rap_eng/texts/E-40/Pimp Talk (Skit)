[Verse]
Yea back in the day niggas was pimpin from rich town, the Oakland
Throughout the bay over to San Francisco
For all the hoes be down on Eddie street, Fillmore District
All the pimps yo know what I’ sayin, be down wit the hoes makin sure they get paid
Hoes is choosin, and all d niggas I know that was really havin hoes that day
In a cadillac calais 1970
Ted, Frank, Buddy Buzil,Fillmore Slim
All d max, SD, Goo-baby,Stepping Charlie
Real macs, real playas, find real serious cadillacs
They slammin cadillac doors an makin em hoes pay
That’s the way they play
