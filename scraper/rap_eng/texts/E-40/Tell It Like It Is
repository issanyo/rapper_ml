[Verse:]
How can I help you
What can I do for ya
Looking for that china white
Girl that's so soft
If I ain't got it
I know where to find it
If i can get it for you
Boss
How much you got in your budget
The more you buy the less it costs
I could front you a few off the side
As long as your ass don't double cross
You crossed a lot of racoons
Get your cranium sawed off
I got mouths to feed my nigga
I can't afford to take no loss
I can give your ass a number
Its up to you to keep it quite
You can't be a punk about the hustle
You gotta keep the money coming
I'm out here
Dealing with these suckers
Stopping the fake ass busters
They stab your ass in the back
These brothers turn on you
I know when its gonna be a shortage
How long this shortage suppose to last
I ain't got the weather channel
To predict the forecast
The plan is hustling
Cause there ain't no work there
Ain't no job
So they stuck in playing this game
And the next thing they gonna rob
Bite the hand that feed em
That shit right there ain't y’all
Two faced little ol’ heather
Working with the law
Man no matter what you do for  niggas
They ain't never gonna be satisfied
Tell it like it is
My whole thing is like
Why dudes be letting cats get in their ear though
Im just telling it like it is
I dont know what the fuck
Happened between ‘96 up to now
Nigga is hoes
I’ma tell it like it is
Man niggas is going out backwards man
Killas are snitching my nigga
Whats happening with  that
Tell it like it is
If there was a snake it would have
Bite ya
See you’ve been following so many nigga you wouldn't even know what hit ya
Now you don't know which way to look
You dont really know which way to turn
Got you trying to protect yourself
With all the bridges you done burned
You niggas cry to us nowadays
You niggas feelings get hurt too easily
Might as well wear a tampon might as well be a breezy
A closed mouth dont get fed
And a lazy hustler don't get bread
Pimping i can't read minds
I dont know whats in your head
Everybody think they know it all
Dont wanna hear nobody speak
Shut the fuck up and listen sometime
Even if you an o.G
Me personally  I'm a grinder
Can't let no grass grow under my feet
Dont nothing come to a sleeper but a dream
A vision without a plan is just a hallucination
I gotta lotta folks in the pen
Programming on vacation
I'm gonna give it to you straight
I ain't gonna give it to you late
Imma tell your ass whats real
I ain't gonna tell ya nothing fake
Man i got my own dreams
Everybody wants me to finance theirs
Tell it like it is
You know who i like i like that boy 40 man
He’s 20 years in the game and he consistent
Im just telling it like it is not all of them but a lot of these
New dudes is ringtone rappers man
Ima tell it like it is
Fools just have one album out
And act like they just it
Tell it like it is
Same song third verse
Its from the heart it ain't rehearsed
The world is full of associates but very few friends
Don't  wanna contribute nothing
But wanna help spend your ends
Think before you rocking your mouth
Park your tongue and lip
Watching who you talkin round
Never know who you're having dinner with
You ain't got nothing good to say
Dont say nothing at all
Thats what i was told
That's what i was taught when i was small
A lot of these so called artists got too much time on ya hand
Should be getting your money
On
Instead of hating on the next man
Its lonely at the top
But its next to crowded at the bottom
That's why I always keep my pistol cocked
In case i gotta stop ‘em
Stinkter(3:03)  in my lap
Trunk full of slap
Hollering at ‘em back
(3:06)
Pocket full of scraps
Nothing but thousand stacks
I’m old school acting a fool making my
Presence known
I look at business face to face
Dont like to talk on phones
When i'm at a stop sign or a red light I leave one car
Space in front of me
Tell it like it is
Just so i could have enough room to get up outta there
Just in case someone try to pop at me or something
Tell it like it is
Thats how i was raised
I'm still a student of the game
You could learn from a baby
I'ma tell it like it is
Man i was hollering at my grand partner
He said 40 return phone calls and you’ll keep your friends
Tell it like it is
Bitch
You two faced ass motherfuckers
I didn't just help create my music motherfucker
I invented it
Everybody wanna know what the fuck mob music is nigga this is mob music nigga
Poor ass motherfuckers
Bitch
