All up n ya ear, rockin' like bamboo
Rockin' like, rockin' like, bamboo Bam bam bamboo Ughhh, the beat is excoriating
Your libel to find me up at an old school [?]
Scooting and skating, beating and quaking, waking up the ave
With a yellow bone the same complexion as a cab
Money on my agenda ever since I came out the placenta, blowing and puffing on this indicia
I'm a movie, I'm a cinema, motion picture gold figure. 7 figure nigaa
Just because I rap, don't think I won't squeeze the trigga'
Not a barber but I pack an extra clippa'
Put you in your place
Send a couple of crash dummy, open up your face
I'm addicted to this fast money rushing like race
Fuckin' around with the baking soda not that toothpaste
Imma do it till its doomsday, till the day I'm sentenced
In the meantime in between time, speak your money into existence
Speak your money into existence, talking it up
Man you gone live a long time, that's what's up

All up n ya ear, rockin' like bamboo
Rockin' like, rockin' like, bamboo Bam bam bamboo Ugghh
First off, we the opposite of soft
We love to get twisted like fingers crossed
We stay smoking like bad exhaust
Raculini, Zucchini, aviation, vegetation
Broken English, distinguish E40's translation
Protection my weapon of choice, magical
Walther ppq m2, tactical
I like guns with body action. Like moss burns
So intruders, they'll get what they deserve
Everybody in my platoon in a tycoon for sure
Trips to Jamaica, vacation buy up the top floor
I got ears, I be spitting a minute [?] bitch. Wordsmith got a cold sales pitch
I can sell paper to a tree, water to the sea, snow to Tahoe, chips to Bellagio
Fuckin Halle Berry's on my bucket list, I'll stick my tongue in her pussy lips

All up n ya ear, rockin like bamboo
Rockin like, rockin like, bamboo Bam bam bamboo Waking' em up, waking' em up
Waking' em up, waking' em up
Waking' em up, waking' em up
All up in their ear like, bamboo
Bamboo(bamboo) Bamboo(bamboo)
Bamboo(bamboo) Bamboo(bamboo)
Bamboo(bamboo) Bamboo(bamboo)
Bamboo(bamboo) Bamboo(bamboo)
Bitch
