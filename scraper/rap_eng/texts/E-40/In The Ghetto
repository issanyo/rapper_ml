[Verse 1:]
G-H-E-T-T-O pissed stained mattress on the floor sub stations and liquor stores
Get out a pocket get peeled a roll, every fuckin day there’s a funeral
A kid will shoot you and tag your toe
No a/c just windows and fans section 8 with programs
Juvenile hall youth authority task force housing authority
Hoodies beenie caps and p coats niggas will scratch to sell dope
Soul food spots barber shops old school chevys big blocks
Luxury scrapers dreadlocks and tapers bald heads french braids and perms
The bootleg man with dvd burns quality shit no returns
Gift cards green dot cards moneygrams walmarts
Confidential informants, CI’s, wire taps FBIs
Wide splats all type of lies down to Beverly Hills housewives
I’m lookin for a handout tryin to find a way out
Lookin for a money route tryin to get some pay out Makin beef like a steakhouse specially with my k out
Suckas better stay out fenna they get laid out
The Salvation Army an goodwill, swap meets, flea markets an rubbishes

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Miss Mary an her grandson, live down inna d ghetto area
In da hood whey we come from we sell ganja jus to take care of her
The sun change d cold rain, a love for d game an d game that comes from it
The love for chains, d fame an cold summers
Yo friends they turn lane an change then try gun ya
Put d pistol to yo brain, right befo’ yo motha’s eyes
Strip you fo’ yo safaz right befo’ yo brotha tries
It’s real out here, you suckas can’t describe, fifty kicks right befo’ they circumcise
That’s ova yo snapback,I-I’m in a war nigga, wit babylon clap backs,kick down yo door nigga
Killer ain’t body strapped charge us wit bo nigga, boy ain’t sellin stacks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Pentecostal an baptist churches, flowers an funeral service
Black suits an hearses, out here it’s callous an merciless
Ankle monitors, push coke (push coke), felonies, can’t vote (can’t vote)
Crack cocaine dope (dope), reek house swivel coke (coke)
How did it get here, we broke, we don’t know no trains planes or boats (boats)
They got me on d run wit ma honey drop, an I don’t know where ma next meal is comin from
Ma assets jus died they hung an burnt them alive (burnt them alive)
Genetically scarred, rebellion all of ma life (all of ma life)
Drinkin ma troubles away, tryna erase ma stress (erase ma stress)
Coughin an chokin an smokin an beatin on ma chest (on ma chest)
Readin d bible, askin ma idol to protect me from ma rival
Plus ma brawd pregnant, mayne, she missed he menstrual cycle (her menstrual cycle)
It’s ugly out here, it’s a eye for a eye an a tooth for a tooth (tooth for a tooth)
It’s grimey out here, they’ll slide by an try to catch you loose (catch you loose)

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
The ghetto man a hustle, an a use him muscle
Sooner or lata, som’n a go get shuffle
Him don’ miss, now him haffi tek up d heata yes

Or else somebody gwah end up get bury
