[Hook]
Tell me when to go like my name E-40
(What's my muthafuckin' name?)

[Verse 1]
Champion hoodie and bean cap, b-boy attire
Every promoter and their partner got my name on they flyer
I'm on this bubba kush right now, higher than a hiker
Folk fresh back from the mountains and he got that fire
Feeling good like you should, liquor in my cup
Understood I'm in the hood like an ice cream truck
Spin with me man, I'll hook you up
Cause I could give you more bang for your buck
Pro politics, property, puzzle pieces pertaining paper
Proceeding profit pockets per digm prosperous promise
Putting the b's in the pockets, proof in the pudding
You probably think that you can but you probably shouldn't
Alice Sylverstein collection watch, biatch
Don't ask me how much this muthafucka cost
You stepping off dollars for pennies
I'm stepping off pennies for dollars
You dealing with hoes and they periods
I'm dealing with hustlers and commas

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My Camaro's souped up, and I ain't talking about Campbell's
Speakers in the crib, and in the door panels
Detachable steering wheel in case they try to steal
Light you up like a candle with my spring steel
Rifle for rival built for survival
It's wacko and homicidal out here in the bay
Pack 90's and SK's, we living the last days
They calling the wrong plays, rolling over in their graves
My ancestors used to be slaves
I try to trust psychos, love them to death
But they be the ones that stir up the most mess
I ask them how they doing and they holler out, "Flex"
Pack and air jet, like they better than the next
I'm the rawest in it, I say the realest shit
Sickest flow, I ain't gon' never quit
Started this independent shit so I'mma finish it
Been in it forever, for a grip, for a minute
BIATCH

[Verse 3]
Stores, like a restaurant
I don't drink to drink, I drink to get drunk
I might eat the pink after I hit the blunt
Dick on hard like a penis pump
Cause she got a big dump
Not the donk with slump, the donk I wanna hump
The type to stick and plunk with junk in her trunk
Hit it from the back and in the front
The function was bammer but we got it cracking
Shit was so quiet you could hear a spider piss on a napkin
Pockets on a diet, hell naw mayne we stacking
Seemed like a riot the way the music had us acting

[Hook]
