[Verse 1: E-40]
I’m locked in
I’m in a zone
I’m blanking
Trainwreck got da whole room stanking
I’m feeling like I’m ‘posed to be
And sober is my enemy
Baileys n Landy, that’s the remedy
Money and power that’s a friend of me
Chain licking like I'm Mini-Me
Campaigning like a Kennedy
They ain’t got no idea, where this finna be
Getcha wet make you sweat out your perm
Bay boy talk slicker than worm sperm
I used to ride with yola in my drawers
1970 Cutlass, wet as Niagara Falls
I’m so wet I need a cloth (wipe me down)
Popo tryin' to dry a motherfucker off
My hydroponics will make you cough
Off dat underwater weed keep smoking like a bad exhaust
You mad cause I got your bitch wetter than bad weather
You have to dry like a sweater bro
I’m the reason she left ya
I threw a party in her mouth than we fucked on her mama’s couch
Now she fuckin witta boss she ain’t fuckin wit no slouch
Man I go bad like a bad tooth
It’s real that I’m caught loose
My 40 calibre is my ooze
You game goofy motherfuckers is false man I’m the truth
The proof
Respect
A vet
Bootch!

[Hook: Ya Boy / E-40]
I get her (wet) – I get her (wet)
I miss dat (wet) – I miss dat (wet)
She say I’m (wet) – She say I’m (wet)
Burner on my hip
Nigga don’t get (wet)

[Verse 2: Ya Boy]
They gon’ have to hunt for me
It’s something clean
Wetter than a submarine
Or sub-machine
Funds are mean YB got mad cash
Shittin on niggas just wait till the gas pass
Kush fillin' the room niggas need gas masks
All Blackjack 15’s kickin like van Damme
Nigga on my momma we (wet) like a ocean
Say we ain’t the dopest
Nigga whatcha smoking
Gotta be da sherm
If it ain’t money than it’s not in my concern
Money to blow, matter fact money to burn
See her money is mines but my money ain’t hers
Flyest nigga standin on da corner of the curb
Cup full of grey goose, wrap full of herb
Always been a hustler
Fuck what you heard
Even outta school I had work like a nerd
YB da rock star fly as a bird
Everybody know Ya Boy da shit like a turd
Pickin it up I know you see the pot ‘sturb
The realest in the game you niggas imposters

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cousin Fik]
Look…

Money is the password
I never been a bastard
I always been a master
Don’t believe me then ask her
You ain’t getting cash then your life’s a disaster
Keep your foot on the gas
Quit fast, get Casper
I’m so proud and cocky
Can’t let you cowards stop me
Come through ’em cow and suck these
With the shower posse
And we all got tats
Pull up in your jacks
And we will leave yo ass (wet)
That’s a bet
Then I’m a jet
Cause I just got a text from my ex
Say she wanna have sex
Better yet she just gotta check
Then leave it up to me to collect
I’ma have her in deck
And she can’t even invest
And yes
I guess
It’s on to the next
Fit the crown on my sweats
Threw the chrome in the Lex
Left, now I’m on the phone with her best
Next, I’ma get some dome and leave her messed
All these wet girls
Are prone to arrest
Cause they heavy a plus
And they pussy be the best

[Hook]
