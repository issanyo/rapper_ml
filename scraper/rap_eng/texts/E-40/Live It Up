Live it up, do it big
We keep it poppin' just like this
Bones pop them bottles in the club
Ladies put your drinks on up
Live it up!

[Roscoe Umali:]
It's Roscoe OOH-mali
Catch me at the crib sippin' Carlo Rossi
AO-Dubs the click; I don't care who you run with
Dawg, I'll split your whole posse
Make 'em get dumb, go stupid and retarded
Ghost ride the whip with your kid in the car seat
The Bay, they push Yay and Swiss Broccoli
In LA, we move weight in Maseratis
And you've prolly never seen a playa quite like me
I pop bottles with the best, and boss up with E-40
The West Coast supports me, East Coast loves me
Down South they give me spins like I'm rappin' over funk beats
I'm universal
It just took a few rehearsals with the Hennessey, Hypnotic, and that Purple Total
And now I'm on one
I seen a couple ladies in the crowd, now it's about time I jump on some!

[Hook]
Live it up, do it big
We keep it poppin' just like this
Bones pop them bottles in the club
Ladies put your drinks on up
Live it up, do it big
We keep it poppin' just like this
Throwing money in the sky
It's our time; we gotta shine!
Live it Up!

[E-40:]
You can find me pullin' off the lot in a brand new Jag
Let a sucka' have it if he breakin' my path
Trespass, and get split in half!
Me know Sam-Sam, Me know Mark
Me know Captain, Me know Clark... Kent
Ain't no tellin' how many hoes I done seen
My pockets ain't touchin', and they ain't full of no lead
I'm a certified showstar, raised and groomed
Ever since I can remember, 40 been a tycoon
I punched the gas, then I hit the brakes
I served the hat, and I cooked the cakes
Attended many funerals, attended wakes
Followed niggas home and got they license plates (OOH)
Fairly long, you can tell by my baller tummy
Roscoe Umali and E-40 got a roll of money!

[Roscoe Umali:]
It ain't as much to say Roscoe's the freshest
And I don't just spit game
Homie, I teach lessons
If it ain't about the paper, I tell 'em get to steppin
I was ballin even way before I ever sold a record
I'm a boss; I just happen to rap good
Pour yourself a drink, jig, twist up a back wood
Relax yourself, let your conscience be free
And I'll rock it to the sounds of Umali and E-40
Yeah, I see shorty, I was like, "What's happenin'? "
Yo boy been fly, girl, this ain't no accident
My whole team is max; you can go ask your friends
They'll tell you bout the whole J. Black and 'em
I'm a seasoned veteran, ya'll need practice and
Took a break from rap, and now I'm back again
And this time around we 'bout to make it official
And stack chips by the fiscal. Come On!
