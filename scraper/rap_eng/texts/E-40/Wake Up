[Intro: A-Wax]
Wake up in the morning press the diamonds in my grill
Grindin' all the time got me shinin' for real

[Chorus: A-Wax]
Mmm, wake up in the morning hustlin'
You wake up in the morning start shit
I wake up in the morning hustlin'
You wake up in the morning start shit
Wake up, wake up in the morning for them cars for them knocks man
Just another day, push some keys like a locksmith
Fuckin' with that China store, suckas get the chopsticks
Steppin' on that dope again, diamonds got me frostbitten'

[Verse 1: A-Wax]
Wake up in the morning for them cars for them knocks man
Have the type of money like E-40 little hog it
Smokin' to the Doobies roll the Backwoods like they logs bitch (Word up)
Might should work for Gucci baby, sewed up those apartments
Pockets blue strippin', I just move different
Run across a stool pigeon with that thing, news clip 'em
You don't really want this paper, do you? You just bullshittin'
Told my jeweler "RBS and [?]" now my jewels hittin'
You look like you went to hell and back
I look like I got it sellin' sacks
Coated the wrist it was hella racks
Flexin' it all on your jealous ass
Walked out of Nieman with hella bags
Hopped outta whip doin' hella fast
Met the bitch walkin' on Telegraph
I'm all in her head like a telepath

[Chorus: A-Wax & E-40]
Wake up in the morning hustlin'
You wake up in the morning start shit
I wake up in the morning hustlin'
You wake up in the morning start shit
Wake up, wake up in the morning for them cars for them knocks man
Just another day, push some keys like a locksmith
(In about three seconds, E-40 will begin to speak)
Fuckin' with that China store, suckas get the chopsticks
Steppin' on that dope again, (E-40) diamonds got me frostbitten'

[Verse 2: E-40]
Woke up in the morning thinking "Allah I'm alive" ('Live)
Jumped off in that water then I hopped up in my ride (Ride)
Everybody know me, I'm as solid as they make 'em (Make 'em)
Ran into my homie he said "Assalamualaikum" ('Laikum)
I can blow bud long as it ain't hard drugs (Drugs)
My parole agent is cool, he be showin' hella love (Love)
My jewelry be bustin', my diamonds be cussin', be speedin' and not be rushin' (Rushin')
You thought that I wasn't 'bout money and hustlin', then you's a piece of nothin' (Nothin')
Lovin' the life that I'm livin', I talk it, I did it, I done it, I walk it (Walk it)
Now I ain't with all that fake shit, I'm solid, I've been at the top like a topic
Most of these niggas is bitches, they know they some bitches, they know that they marks (Marks)
Most of these suckas without the narcotics, they know they ain't got no heart
Biatch!

[Chorus: A-Wax]
Wake up in the morning hustlin'
You wake up in the morning start shit
I wake up in the morning hustlin'
You wake up in the morning start shit
Wake up, wake up in the morning for them cars for them knocks man
Just another day, push some keys like a locksmith
Fuckin' with that China store, sucakas get the chopsticks
Steppin' on that dope again, diamonds got me frostbitten'
