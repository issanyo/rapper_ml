[Chorus]
Bla-blame it on tha DJ (x3)
She wanna drop dat, den run it back (ru-run it back)
An you can blame it on tha DJ
Bla-blame it on tha DJ

[Verse 1]
I’m on like the most requested song
In his eyes, his bitch can do no wrong
In her eyes, look like she wanna jump ma balls
Give me dome, blow me like a saxaphone
When I found ma pieces fit tha ism an manipulatin
I tell her what she wanna hear an make her feel great
Tha smackology, make her feel guilty not me
When I’m wrong, I use reverse psychology
Wen am mackin an stackin madamamashin ma stash to boost up ma stats
From a little analyst into a boss savage
Who had dreams an high hopes to live rich an lavish
Survival skills, mannish right head an hustlin tactics
If it ain’t no bread involved, then I won’t be involved
Unless you’re ma relative or ma partna dawg
Ain’t a rachet type I’m a raspy type like stingy P
DJ put the record to da meat

[Bridge]
In da club goin crazy, errbody drunk
An you can blame it on d DJ
(bla-blame it on d DJ)
An you can blame it on d DJ
(bla-blame it on d DJ)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
So OG but yet so useful
They say between me an you forty low key go
I remember when da nigga used to push blow
Now he on da tracks an in da record store
Puttin on ma chain an pendant, poppin ma collar like a boss
I’m hella long wind, I’ll cock yo ear off
When it comes to spittin game, I’m pro
Don’t check me ma nigga, check yo ho
I’m about this paper, this playa sharp like a razor won’t save her
You wanna wife her an date her, keep her like a crusader
Evertime you pay her she pay me, you buy her a louboutin
I fucked her in ma jeep, in da backseat of ma rubican
Pussy was da bomb! Like this bubba kush
Brazillian wax not no barbara bush
Smokin an drinkin an curvin an swervin, that’s what I specialize in
I like em dark but I prefer light skin

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Indoor trees an tobacco leaves
Grind d weed down, no stivs no seeds
Errway I go you can smell d aroma
I got d lemon squeeze an a case a corona
I’m mannish, even when I’m at work
I go to church smellin like purp (stop lyin!)
You’re right, I just needed som’n to rhyme wit dat line
But certainly out here, mayne this the sign of the times
I be knockin dat sodi water, his beast be here
I fuck wit ma nigga, he say the randomest shit
I grew up on that nigga, he raised me an ma clique
Taught us how to hustle an pick up a brick
How to knock a chick without liftin a finger
Use ma mouthpiece, no misdemeanor
Half money half heart, can’t be no marshmallow
She came in here wit you an left wit me,  ma fella
(bitch!)

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
