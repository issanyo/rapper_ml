[Intro: E-40]
Show them how to break they ankles, mayne
Yeah, E-40 and Shawty Lo

[Hook: Shawty Lo]
Hey, let's go
From the West Coast to Atlanta
If a nigga gonna hate, well, got damn 'em
Hey! Go on an' break ya ankles
Hit the dance floor
Go on an' break ya ankles
Go stupid, get retarded
(Dumb, dumb)
Wake the game up, them boys made it
(Dumb, dumb)
Hey, gonna break ya ankles
We be the shit yaddamean
Go on an' break ya ankles

[Verse 1: E-40]
This a boy, this thang slap
I brought the whole hood with me, brought the whole trap
Mama, this your song, you know the lyrics
Go on an' break ya ankles, yeah, that's the spirit
Go nutty, go bananas, go berserk
Show them how to do it, let me see your foot work
We runnin' up a tab, havin' money so we spend it
Bottles everywhere, celebrating like we won the pennant
You recognize the fixture, you see the brightling watch
You get the big picture, you know that I'm a boss
(I'mma show up, I'mma show out
From the West Coast to the Dirty South)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shawty Lo]
Fresh off tour, I brought a mil' with me
Now the whole club gonna have to deal with me
Like Three 6, tear the club up
Like Pac-Man, cause I don't give a fuck
I'm throwing big bucks, cash everywhere
Shawty over here, 40 over there
You know the broads out cause the stars out
You see the parking lot, we brought the cars out
We going stupid, get retarded
And we ain't playin' with 'em, we came to party
I brought a lot of dough, I'm steady throwin' singles
So hit the dance floor, so go on an' break ya ankles

[Hook]

[Verse 3: E-40]
Do it like this, do it like that
Do it like this, then you do it like that
Break it on down, show 'em how to clown
Mean mug with it, let me see you rep your town
All street money, bonafide trapper
Never seen a check, ballin' like a rapper
80 on the arm, a hunnit on my neck
Shoe game sick, in the Bay we call it wet
More jewelry than the court room, glowin' like the moon
More jewelry than the court room, I'mma tycoon
Designer everything, throw it in the bag
I don't know how much it costs, I don't look at price tags

[Hook]
