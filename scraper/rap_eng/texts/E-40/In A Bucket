[Chorus:]
Ski mask, 3 throw aways
My niggas that’s driving just got out today
These niggas ain't playin they goin knock shit down
4 niggas in the bucket (x2)

[Verse 1:]
Black runners or surgical gloves, misle shapes slugs
Camp out in front of ya crib or catch you at the club
Them niggas is activated them niggas with the shit
Got offered some bread but turned it down and reverse the hit
The art of frontin neva know who ya havin the dinner with
Protect ya punk and throw away some extended banana clips
When you with your baby and your chick let her drive so you can blast
They don’t care who in the whip they might not give you a pass
Anybody can get it don’t think they won’t
What fools fail to realise it costs money to float
If you ballin make sure you get insurance bra
Get some money put up so ya folks can bury ya
It’s sick like malaria in the streets of california
Where you from might be scarier in your hood or on your corner
These gangstas where i stay ain't for play
What they would do?
-Put you out like a cigarette in the ash tray

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
It’s get’s nasty when it’s dry and ain't no work on the gravel
A lot of bullets start fly but no names in the gun battle
Innocent people get hit when the hot ones travel
They’ll be no chicken when you beefin like a cattle
Sds and mmb’s what i tote (tote)
Ready at all times, woke (woke)
Bust your head like a cantaloupe no joke no joke
Jackie h or master kush is what i smoke, no coke, no coke
Got you with the slump
Youngsta's payin homage; talkin' bout
"what’s up with unc'?"
Dumper up under my seat; incase an unexpected funk
Outta here we play for keeps, cause we don’t like to play forgive
Masterminds what you gotta be if you wanna live

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
It’s like David and Goliath, Daniel in the lions den
When you in it, can’t have no glass jaw or cotton chin
Violence won’t ever end, rewind
It’s been here since the beginnin of time
I try to take yours so you try to take mine
When I was young I was stupid, dumb and blind
That’s what the OG said, what he do?
Got on his head
3 days later he ended up dead
I’m talkin bout the youngster that was talkin to that og
Didn’t know the og was proven and got hella bodies
Got helium and one crawl beans and mac 90’s
Came here to take his factors out when in the 90s
Keepin his little grinders got that world
Dress up like a homeless man and shoot ya in your neuro
(in your neuro?)
Bitch

[Chorus:]
Ski mask, 3 throw aways
My niggas that’s driving just got out today
These niggas ain't playin they goin knock shit down
4 niggas in the bucket [x2]
In the buck, in the bucket
