BASE ROCKS NIGGA!!!

[Hook: E-40]
I remember when the world went crazy back in 1985
I remember when rock cocaine used to be rich man kind of high
'Til one day in my neighborhood motherfuckers started havin' fetti
They was hangin' on the corner yellin' "BASE ROCKS NIGGA!"
Bumpin' Too Short "Blowjob Betty"

[Verse 1]
11-15-67, nigga, learn about it
A nine-pound breach baby, future alcoholic
Hit the cradle with a big ass naple, young beginner
Attended pre-school in North Vallejo, Country Club Crest child care center
First grade elementary, Loma Vista, walkin' the hobo trail
Bobbin' and weavin' after school, snotty nose
Fistfightin' in the battlefield
Thumps, box of matches, lumps
Live down the street from coochie dippin' drive
With the girls and guys
I'm prepared for the worses, moms and pops divorces
Time to switch the scene, smob to Magazine
Government grilled cheese, single-parent inner-city shit
Only way to get yours was to get out there and pull some sort of illegal shit
Way before the distribution of the coca plant
Niggas was pushin' grass
Residue from the hemp, concentrated hash
My folks from the hood helped raise me
Can you remember when the world went crazy?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Now it's 19-eighty-fifth
And I haven't quite made my way up to a unit yet
My sinister game was boomin'
But I haven't quite made my way up to a unit yet
Standin' in front of my next door neighbor's house
I made my own set, money was comin' to me
Turf fired up, base rock boomer
Only nigga in the town besides cokin' sidin' in the Cougar
LL had the bumble, and so did Bobby Jimmy's
Everybody in Vallejo ass was on grimmies
Smash through Foley Park with tremendo
Claimin' hella fame in a dopefiend rental
From a nickel and dime ass nigga
To a top hat ballin' big rigga, BITCH!

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Livin' it up to the fullest
Never thinkin' about givin' it up
Maybe it will, maybe it won't be foolish to get up out of dodge Drove to Grambling College
Me and that nigga B-Legit on some ol' 'D-Shot, I'm home sick'
Ripped back on the shrine, garglin' Rossi wine
From turf to turf, when it goes from worst to worse
Ain't no fuckin' merch, gotta go for what it's worth
Young Ive, where you at? Me, you and cousin Kaveo
On the two-four twist like this
Suga, E-40, D-Shot, Legit
Never had no ideal that we would become The Click
Shot the game to the left, got it up to par
Now that's how the fuck you become a rap star

[Hook x2]

[E-40 talking]
C-L-I-C-K in this motherfucker
It's 40 Water on a solo shot
Smeb, smeb, smeb [* Sips *] [* Burps *]
Swervin' BITCH!

[Repeated 4X]
BASE ROCKS...BASE ROCKS NIGGA!!!
