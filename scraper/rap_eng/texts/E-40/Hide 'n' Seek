[E-40]
I'm in some deep shit, I got some niggas from another clique
On that ass trying to run me off a fuckin cliff
What should I do? Where should go?
How could I fake 'em?
Bust a bitch on that ass and try and shake em and bake em
Full speed ahead, I know they want my ass dead
Still on my bumper, makes a motherfucker wonder
All the dirt that I did, should just let them get me
Maybe its because I killed Rodney and his whole family
Revenge, I see my life flashing, niggas blasting
Brothas passing, trying to make me stay crashing
Into the rocks beside me, fucking up the traffic
17th in a Malibu Chevy classic
But I'm nothing humble, just call me Yapeez Pasano
Full tank of petro, mobbin through the fucking tunnel
Shit it's bright, I think I see some daylight
Over the night, you should have seen a brothas sides right
Fit the corners on two shoes, I'm holly G
Wrapping my shit around a fifty foot oak tree
Got out the car, seeing stars, I wasn't lagging
Ran out and hid behind a beat up station wagon

[Hook]
You've never seen a bitch nigga run so fast

[E-40]
Bouncing, sneaking, and peaking, hitting bushes and shit
Never saw, like you did in that movie clip
Steady busting, these motherfuckers ain't bluffing
I'm hauling ass and renting bullets, constantly cussing
Scared as fuck, I wasn't trying to act hard
Thumbs up, and ran in a back yard
Just as I was hoping the sliding door was wide open
Out of breath, I locked the door and started talking
I need some help, I gotta bounce, someone's after me
Please don't panic, I need your help drasticly
I'm not a G, a killer, or a rapist
I'm just a ordinary black man trying to make this
Busting my bubble, the couple didn't even freak
They said relax, I'll make some coffee, have a seat
The man said, whats your name bro
Shit I don't know, you might decide to call the po-po
He said that ain't my thang, I used to be a leader of a gang
Shot twice in my chest
I got wounds, where I've been stabbed
He took off his shirt and showed my his scab
I said damn partner, how the fuck you survive some shit like that
Like that there without going into a coma
He said the Lord spared my life
So I could talk to people like you and teach them right
I was a dope pusher, big time drug abuser
Alcoholic, dog blumer, but a shooter
All together working from the floor
I said I better twist so I can call her
Now I'm reached from coast to coast
Said to saved from the holy ghost
I know you think your trapping
But let me pray for you junior and see what happens
