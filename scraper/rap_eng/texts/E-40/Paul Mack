[Hook x2: Joie 13]
They tricking they treating
This game is like Halloween
13 with a Vader mask
Pimp C with a laser beam
Rely on my pimping deep space when I'm slaying whores
Give thanks for my daily bread ask yourself what you praying for

[Verse 1: Joie 13]
Alle Alle auch sind frei fresh off a copping spree
The bag touched down it's like a self fulfilling prophecy
I skip to my Mary Lou my flip is gymnastic
Hit her with Mac Dre she never seen a savage
Raw like the dirty bastard but call me Mr. Clean
A non violent takeover like Martin Luther King
From Malcolm X's stomping ground where Magic Johnson balled
My pen game is hella sharp from vandalizing walls
French kissing Alexandra inside a bathroom stall
Joie got the strip jumping just like a shopping mall
I hit em with the 8 Ball it's space age pimping
All you got to do is listen and you'll hear Richard sniffing
Real live rail ripping I call it blade running
Joie dropping hella names he must be Game's cousin
1 fiend 2 fiend 3 fiend 4
Somebody bless the DJ because he got the pure

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: E-40]
Who am I? I'm the guy
What you do? I replied
Rap now but I use to push pies way back in 1985
1985 should of been dead but I'm still alive
International world wide gotta thank God I survived
You might want to hide your boo
Some pimps don't wear suits
Just jeans and tennis shoes flyer than a parachute
Everybody know my handle keep lit like a candle
Light a cigarette Camel far bank roll man doe
I don't like suckers bitchin' made mother fuckers
Back stabbing ass pions barking over there fianc√©
Say, the bitch chose me
Took a shot crown some tangeray
Dick her down she call me everyday
Lost and found now she hear to stay
Her ex dude's a clown nigga don't like me
I make him bow down the K I pull the K
Put it to his crown send him in his way
It make sound let him know
I don't play California that's what we do everyday
