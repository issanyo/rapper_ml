[Chorus: Willy Will]
When I look outside my window
I see haters all around
I get a money like the wind blow
They will never see the crown

[Verse 1: E-40]
You the juge, you the source, the connect
Blood on yo' money 'cause you never seen a check (check)
In your 'hood you're respected, you're a vet
All the little homies show you love and respect (check)

Granny'n'nem prayin' and hopin'
That you ain't got change on yo' head and yo neck (check)
The Good Lord has spoken, he got you, you covered
No need for a bulletproof vest (check)

Momma from Richmond, and Daddy from Oakland
They both from the trenches, the turf (check)
Annointed, you chosen, you blessed, and they knowin'
Give back to yo' city and church (check)

Credentials is notarized, all on the 'Net
By my name is a verified check (check)
A fixture, I'm bonafie, most of y'all modified
Look in the mirror and check (check)

[Pre-Chorus: E-40]
Blowin' on herbal (check)
Your car is turbo (check)
Concrete and thorough (check)
Go down on your girl (check)
Sippin' on Earl (check)
Known around the world (check)
The blocks and burroughs (check)
Free my nigga Lil' Darryl (check)

[Chorus: Willy Will]
When I look outside my window
I see haters all around
I get a money like the wind blow
They will never see the crown

[Verse 2: E-40]
Stickin' to the rules, lookin' out for my dudes
(Check, check, check, check)
Took 'em on a cruise, and I'm makin' boss moves
(Check, check, check, check)

Always kept it 100, paid tithes, paid dues
(Check, check, check, check)
Got up out the game without a scratch or a bruise
(Check, check, check, check, check)

Suckas don't like me, and I don't like suckas
'Cause we are so far from compatible (check)
Suckas be all in they feelings, be hella self-conscious
Start acting irrational (check)

He don't like me, but his bitch, she like me
She a freak but she come off as bashful (check)
On my neck is a key, didn't get it for free
'Cause I hustle to hard for the capital

[Pre-Chorus: E-40]
Raised in the slums (check)
Born in the dirt (check)
Low on my funds (check)
When my pockets was hurt (check)
Came up like a boss (check)
The truth, not false (check)
Cut a snake head off (check)
If he double cross (check)

[Chorus: Willy Will]
When I look outside my window
I see haters all around
I get a money like the wind blow
They will never see the crown
