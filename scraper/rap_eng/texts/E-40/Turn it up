I turn it up on a bitch (x8)

[E-40]
I ain't got no time for no silly games
I'm out here in this trap trying have my change
I fuck with real bosses, I don't fuck with lames
Califor-n-i-a is the state I claim
Bitches on my ankle like a ankle bracelet
Cuz I'm relevant and I ain't outdated
Suckers looking at me like they wanna fade it
They fuck around they gona get emlimated
Bossy, flossy, fetti stretchy like Pilates
Got a black belt hustlin, not karate
The best thing sense the slot machine
She a dime spitter, a couple of lines and that bitch is mine's
Now I don't know what you been thinking
But I've been the shit in my region
Ever sense I can remember
Ever sense I been breathing
Hollerin at a vixen, plottin on some kitten
When I start spittin, she starts strippin

I', passionate about my paper man
I ain't got time for games
The child shit ain't in my program man
I leave that to you all lanes
I'm bossy, once I get started its hard to stop me man I go
Lieutenant rosta boss I ain't "Captain Save a Hoe"
I let a bitch know I got cho-ho, bitch I'm po'
You gotta dig me for me, that's the way it's gonna go
I be galaxy man, I be spacin
When I'm spacin I mean my space and gettin the flash on a ho-ass nigga tryin test my patience
Colt 45 casing, and I ain't talkin about the beer
I'm talkin street instruments, music to my ears
I ain't a pretty nigga with a face tat and a six pack
But I bet you I could beat your bitch's coochie back
Skinny niggas winning right now
But wait til big nigga come back in style
Bitch

You call it swag, I call it stylin
You nut in a minute, I nut in an hour
I could be broker then you, but I got more respect and more power
Right now I sell CD's, but I used to slang powder
I ain't gotta have no paper to get me skin
I just give had her my phone and she punch her number in
Mack game, big boss talk
I don't make it rain and I don't pay for yoak
You see the big face Rolex watch, the VS1 clarity watch
The jacket made out of fox, you know how much that cost?
The three dimensional medallion, more carets than Bugs Bunny
Taylor made and hand crafted, customized by King Johnny
Sometimes I like to spoil myself
All'a that hatin ain't nutritious, it's bad for your health
What about murder mouthin, talk down on a boss
Through that nigga a towel, he been dipped in sucker sauce
