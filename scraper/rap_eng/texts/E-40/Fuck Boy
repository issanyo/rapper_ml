[Intro: Lyssi & E-40]
Fuck, fuck boys
Fuck, fuck boys
Push the claps so hard
No one now with a fuck boy
Feel me on this one now

[Verse 1: E-40]
Lyssi, ever, ever sit can be a wak
I’m the real until I die
I ain’t with the sucker movement
I’mma wak until I prove it
When I ever lose I get your money up
Pockets all ? doctors say they need a ?
I feel like a ?, read between ?
I do the crime, I’mma do mine
I never tell for reduce
I don’t do what they do, that do it and this is true
Play by the rules of the game or that game pulse none at you

[Hook: Lyssi]
I don’t want a fuck boy
Can’t do none with 'em (She don't wanna fuck with it mate, she don't want it work)
I don’t want a fuck boy
Waste too much time with 'em (Your shit right)

[Verse 2: Lyssi]
Lost all tracks with my last nick (Last nick)
Main reason I'm single
Cause I don’t fuck with the fuck niggas (Fuck niggas)
But that’s the only thing the wind blow
You a fuck boy keep it wet for me (Keep it wet)
You don’t need to hold you that, just do the same for me
I'm my own bitch, I ain't your ? (Talk cool)
I’m a bitch now, hope you can see
The fuck boy, the type that'll change up (Change up)
Definitely need a nigga, got my change up (Change up)
That’s why just do me (Do me)
Fuck with a, fuck boy in two weeks

[Hook: Lyssi]
I don't want a fuck boy (Tell 'em, girl)
Can't do none with 'em, no
I don't want a fuck boy (Watch these fools, though)
Waste too much time with 'em (You with the real one, now)

[Verse 3: Lyssi]
A fuck boy comment on my last picture (Last picture)
Acting like it's ?
Cause I’m the baddest outta all these bitches (All of 'em)
But I don’t been that, done that (Done that)
I'm on some new shit, I don’t fuck with niggas
I hit the stripclub ? (Oh-oh)
And they don’t wanna scream at no another hoes
They all up in my phone, tryna call that
I know you fuck boy, you just wanna be (Wanna be)
Thinking you the shit, who you supposed to be? (Supposed to be)
And we could never be the same us
Fuck boy I ain’t got no trust

[Hook: Lyssi]
I don't want a fuck boy (No trust)
Can't do none with 'em (Scream that shit down)
I don't want a fuck boy (Ladies)
Waste too much time with 'em

[Verse 4: E-40]
A real one don’t stay in the house
A real one don’t sit on the couch
A real one don’t run their mouth
A real one [?]
A real gon' say what he gotta say what he say
A real one gon' pray every time, it’s time to pray
Now I was raised on the soil where the [?]
[?] duct tape, aluminum foil
A fake one gon’ do what he can
A real one gon’ do what he want
A real one gon’ be a man
A fake one gon’ be a chump

[Hook: Lyssi]
I don’t want a fuck boy
Can't do none with 'em
I don't want a fuck boy
Wase too much time with 'em
