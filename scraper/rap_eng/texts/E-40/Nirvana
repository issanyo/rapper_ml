[Intro: Myles Parrish & P-Lo]
P-P-P-Lo, time to bring the bass back
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they tryna fuck with my vibe
But I don't play when it comes to my mind
I know that my gang got my back like a spine
All about that cake, yeah it's lit, boy it's time

[Chorus]
Ain't about the blues, little boy, you can keep it
All I do, is get the bag and repeat it
On the move, they be stuck for no reason
In the groove, got the flavor of the season
Ay, Always touching green like a collard
Ay, Order double rice at Benihana
Ay, All about the bands like Nirvana
Feelin' like I'm Chance, don't want no problems
Ay ay
And when it comes to the fam and the bands
Always know I put 'em first, ay
It's a photo shoot, need a cam, god damn
Killed it now we need a hearse, ay, Yeah
If they want to hate that's them
Ay, I been on a wave, go swim
Ballin' all net no rim (yeah)

[Verse]
She got that water, Aquafina
Como la flor, ayy, R.I.P. Selena
Six digits in my bank, no that ain’t ‘nuff
I done got it out the mud, had to clean up (ayy)
Yeah, see me in the coupe dropped fast, shit god damn (ayy)
Even if she got no ass, still won’t pass (ayy)
That's my baby, my baby (ayy)
Ballin' in the Bay like I'm KD (ayy)
Always been the one like McGrady (ayy)
Never been the one to be complainin' (ayy)
I done glowed up from a Honda
No, you cannot be around us
Thought they had it, but they time up
Made it from the pressure like a diamond

[Pre-Chorus]
I know they tryna fuck with my vibe
But don't play when it comes to my mind
I know my gang got my back like a spine
Brought that cake, yeah it's lit, boy it's time

[Chorus]
Ain't about the blues, ain't no boy you can keep it
All I do, is get the bag and repeat it
On the move, they be stuck for no reason
In the coupe, got the flavor, the season
Always touching green like a collar (ayy)
Order double rice at Benihana (ayy)
All about the bands like Nirvana (ayy)
Feelin' like I'm Chance, don't want no problems (ayy)
Ayy, and when it comes to the fam and the bands always know I put 'em first (ayy)
It's a photo shoot, need a cam, god damn, killed it now we need a hearse (ayy)
Yeah, if they want to hate that's them
I been on a wave, go swim (ayy)
Ballin' all net no rim

[Outro: E-40]
Listen man, hungry and humble
So you stay hungry, you gotta stay on the gas pedal
You gotta stay all gas, no brake pads
You know what I mean?
And you gotta stay humble
You can't get big-headed and start burnin' bridges and start high-sighting on people, you know, that helped you get to where you at
You understand me?
