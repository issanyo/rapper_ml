Hook:
Party goin up, like a airplane
I Gotta cup full of octane
Yeah I'm on one, more like 2
I don't know about you, but I'm Wasted x4
Oh oh oh oh oh oh I'm wasted x4
One one one one one
One shot two shot three shot
Dj let that beat drop cuz I'm wasted
I'm so wasted

Ughhhh
I'm goin up like the price of gold
I'm on the phone with the homie
With ya bitch on hold
Deep pockets, My paper can't fold
Look bankroll so swoll think like a dictionary book
In my demographics we push elbows and bricks
We like to hear ourselves talk, and say slick shit
Like I had this one broad named one young ho
Her best friends name was Nopay
I changed her name to get my dough
Operation stack a dollar, I'm having my multiplication
I get faded every day, every days a special occasion
Every nights a celebration, used to like a preso
Double fist to gettin green like gettin pesto

Cousin Fik:

So it don't make a difference if I chase it
As long as when I finish somebody replace it
Fo gotta nigga movin slow like the matrix

E-40:
Listen to this here
I'm married to my street sign, jump the broom
Don't plan on gettin no divorce, no time soon
The black Daniel Boone, alcohol consume
Been drinkin since 1 o' clock, this afternoon
Cool with all the goons
I'mma tycoon air this bitch out like a helium balloon
Ready for war state of mind always on the case
Black arsenal like Travis air force base
Deep like yo bitches throat
Yapered up money long like train smoke
She Cali pigeon, body crazy
The definition of Cali pigeon is shapeless, buttocks
Kerne had to get a second taste
How she stack?
Stack like some buttermilk pancakes
I'm loaded and I'm twisted and I'm faded
In the function gettin white boy wasted
