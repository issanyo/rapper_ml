[Intro]
This is the remix
League of Starz
Trend on the beat

[Chorus: Problem]
Ayy, ayy, bitch, try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function

[Verse 1: E-40]
Uh, I slid into the function (the throw)
Lookin' hella dipped (saucy)
Lit like a strobe light (like a strobe light?)
Hella diamonds on my wrist (bling)
You can call me your highness 'cause I'm hella high in this (bling)
Play with their mind like a shrink like I’m a psychiatrist (skrink)
No dryness, I make your chick hella climax (cream)
Even nicer wet, she tellin' me that I'm the best (scream)
You don’t want her, I’ll take her off your hands and do you a favour (favour)
You might not regret it now but you gon' regret it later (later)
I'm about my paper, stapler right on the side of my hip (hip)
In case a hater want it, in case he decide to trip
Platinum plannin', shippin' and handlin', see these are digital sales (digital sales)
Used to push E up from the scale but now it's legitimate skrill
You ain't understand it, that this game evolved from the heels (from the heels)
Vallejo Cali RB the H-I double L’s (bitch)

[Chorus: Problem & E-40]
Ayy, ayy, bitch, try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function
Rip the game up, Jeezy

[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]
Don’t compare me to niggas, I'm the last of my kind (kind)
Get forever through these bars, ever lastin' my grind (yeah)
If it ain't about money, then you wastin' my time (time)
Mix the molly with the liquor now get out of your mind (yeah)
Gotta do is one for the town, it’s town business (ayy)
I don’t even fuck with these clowns, the clown niggas
In the city where the dealers go broke, they turn killers
And all the bad bitches got all the hoes, they like niggas (damn)
In the city where we gonna do broke, we like figures (that's right)
Get that bag then we goin' to work like Jay Bilas (woo)
We out here tryna function, tryna maintain (maintain)
They said to don’t judge me, told the judge the same thang (yeah)
So guess who is up in the club with the four nickel (nickel)
Man, I stay on the point like icicle (yeah)
If I die tonight bring me back at the Coachella ('chella)
Sick and tired of tellin' these hoes, I'm that nigga (yeah)

[Chorus: Problem & E-40]
Ayy, ayy, bitch, try this
Guaranteed to turn a square to a bi bitch
You ain't down, b-b-bye bitch
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function, man, we out here tryna function
I ain't got time for playin', I'm just sayin', man
We out here tryna function

And when she throw it back, nigga, don’t act like a bitch

In the function, ain't a competition, killin' opponents
And I be killin' the pussy but this is just for the moment, yikes

Like, bitch, try this, I'm a high risk
A bank roll, 4-5-6 (cha-ching)
She chasin' the act, with a clip in the mac
For my Oakland niggas that be pimpin' the rap (haaa)
I'm a New York nigga with a bailey (haaa)
Kept it in the hood, fuck the mainstream (haaa)
Wrist rocky, I'm talkin' Adrian (haaa)
Me and 40 run up on ya like the A train (haaa)
Man, we out here tryna function, fuck all the fuck shit
