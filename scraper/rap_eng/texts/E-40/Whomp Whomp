[Intro:]
For me
Whomp, whomp, whomp (x8)
Oooh weee

[Verse 1::]
Skit, dit, roll the script
Chuck, smoke, down ya throat
Bounce, hop, drop the top
Been a few counts turn up the knots
Scroll through the spot with every dope dealin
We used to breakin windows like porcelain
Whomp, whomp, whomp ooh wee
Playas in the traffic off  juice or gin
Tryna money mac up on some scrillion
I don’t have to have a lot scrill ya
For me to turn that sipp into a million
If i can turn that sipp into a million
Just think what I can do with a kiss

[Chorus:]
Say you want say you ride with me
Whomp, whomp, whomp
Say you want live like luxury
Whomp, whomp, whomp
Diamond rings, fancy things
Things ain't always really as it seems
Whomp, whomp, whomp
For me
Whomp, whomp, whomp

[Verse 2:]
Well, deal, ride the steps
Operations that broke and you hold some steps
You side ways like there ain't no tomorrow
Don’t beg or borrow you take this and separate us no need the fakeness
Lens so i smack it make you feel like earthquakeless
Gotta hold back no intentions to say shit
None of this should be played high volume residentials
No amps but the police ain't trippin they all went to the scraps man
That’s what happens when i gets the paypa
National geographic, wildlife, the jungle
Growl with it thrust big and husky
Trust me I ain't the quarterback so don’t rush me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You didn’t want me when i was leaking
I see you peakin but baby you ain't speakin
Just met me reapin the other day on the dance floor
At the club with liquor comin all out of my pores
To my thug this a thing a magig all day
At the bar drinkin hennessy shots and grandma yeah
I gotta tell ya the beautifuls the ankle play
Had you callin your uncle earl on ya birthday
Drunk drivin i’m telegraphed in bird play
Wakin up in the holder cell the next day
Not remembering me can’t even think that far
They must have caught me in public
Pissin on my car with the knock goin

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro:]
Whomp, whomp, whomp
Say you wanna
Oohhhoooo for me
Ohhoooo
Think, think, think
Ooooohhhhhhh
