[Intro: Too $hort + E-40]
Ay, 40, I don’t know if they ready for this, mayne
E-40 and Too $hort in this thang, nigga
ShonuFF on the muthafuckin’ slap, NOW!
We got Knotch in here on this muthafuckin’ pimpin’
It’s game involved in everything we do

[Verse 1: E-40]
He in the party talking loud like he always do
On like a muthafucka, him and his crew
Knife in his dreads, Derringer in his shoe
Walking in limping, him and his crew
Feeling it, fame and fetti
Sitting at the bar with his fingers in her panties (What else?)
Leanin’ (leanin’), nodding off
Trying to convince her, to give him some boss (BIATCH!)
Sophisticated broad, love to twerk
Especially when she hear E-40 and Too $hort
When people hear they music, they go dumb
Bring the gangsta out a square, bring the ratchet out a nun
Being broke sucks, but ballin’ is fun
That’s why I stay tucked, with my gun
She lit like a candle, her va-jay-jay on fire
She want me to sprinkle her, I’m the firefighter

[Hook: Knotch]
She said she’s on fire
Calling me firefighter
She said she’s on fire
Calling me firefighter
And I put her out
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Calling me firefighter

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
I’m like CO2
I do all the things that he won’t do
You can laugh at me, call me a liar
But when she’s on fire, I’mma ride her
I’m in side her, no lyin’
On my dick, got her screaming like a siren
I drive thru like In-N-Out
I fuck her real good then I’m out (BITCH!)
‘Cause I only want one thing
Sign my name on the sheets with a cum stain
And if you want some more of me
Dial 9-1-1 when you’re horny (I’m on it)
As soon I walk inside, we startin’ it
That’s where you call the whole damn fire department
That pussy is so hot
I ain’t never gon’ stop

[Hook: Knotch]
She said she’s on fire
Calling me firefighter
She said she’s on fire
Calling me firefighter
And I put her out
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Calling me firefighter

[Bridge: Knotch + (E-40)]
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She burnin’ (She burnin’)
She burnin’ (She burnin’)
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She on fire (Fire)
She burnin’ (She burnin’)
She burnin’ (She burnin’)

[Hook: Knotch]
She said she’s on fire
Calling me firefighter
She said she’s on fire
Calling me firefighter
And I put her out
Out, out, out, out, out, out
Calling me firefighter
