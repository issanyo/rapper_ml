[Intro: Lenny Williams]
Let go and let God
Fight your battles
All you got to do is just believe
And have the faith of a mustard seed

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ooh, Right now it's feast or famine
Either your eating or your starving
Houses upside down foreclosure government auction bargain
It's nasty out here it's bad it's awful as one big yesterday
Befor yesterday they picked up my car got repossessed
What's next?
They found cancer in her chest
My lil homie momma maine, they talking about cutting off her breasts
Ran hella test, mammograms and stuff
Nervous breakdown her husband left when it rains it pours it's rough
Somebody got shot today and everybody knows who did it
It's easy to kill a man but its harder to live with it
Karma used to take three years but now it only take thirty minutes
The victims family shed they tears Memorial Day they go to visit
The grave site the rest of the place were the family members layn
And then they light a candle and put flowers on it maine
A lot of my folks still here a lot of my folks been danish
Got to provide you with the peanut butter and jelly
But you got to make the sandwich

[Hook: Lenny Williams]
Let go and let God
Fight your battles
All you got to do is just believe
And Have the faith of a mustard seed
Let God fight your battles
All you got to do is just believe
Ans Have the faith of a mustard seed


[Verse 2: E-40]
I'm on the line with my relative she crying
She said: 'He might not come when you call him
But he always right on time.'
I said: 'Thats old people talk.'
She said: 'them old people ain't lying I was in church in
The other day and all i put was a dime
A dime?
Yep, a dime triple times I got breaded back today just enough to spend
But in a whole other way my income tax came in
Got some credit cards to pay and I own a couple friends
I said I'm saved ain't nothing to be ashamed
We all in the same boat but God is in the blessing game
The majority of us is broke we all going through some thangs
You gotta pray and hold onto your hope like a hub cap in the fast lane
My daughter pregnant and her boyfriend don't give a damn
Cereal, milk, cheese and egss apply for the WIC program
EBT, EBT, Electronic benifit transfer, it's plain to see
Single parents got it hard


[Hook:]

[Outro: Lenny Williams]
It don't matter what your going through
Trust in God & he will see you through
If you ain't got no money if you don't have no gas
If your in a relationship & seem like it ain't gonna last
Let go and let God, let go and let God, let go and let God,let go and let God ..
Let him fight your battles
Sometimes you got to moan
And This what i like to say
If you're in the projects, let go and let God
If you're in that prison cell, just let go just let go and let God
If you're in front of the judge , just let go and let God
Let go, let go & let God
If your down at the Welfare office, let go and let God
If somebody is standing in front of you got a gun pointed at you
Just let go and let God just let go and let go ,Yes he will he will fix it for you
I know he will just let go just let go and let God ..
