[Chorus: G Perico]
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout shit
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout shit

[Verse 1: E-40]
Uh
They ain't talkin' bout shit, they talking bullshit
Put the rifle to your lip, longer than a pool stick
Walk down to my target, empty out the cartridge
Talking all that nonsense, turned his body to a carcass
My lil niggas heartless, they push the line the hardest
Open a sucker up, like a can of StarKist
Niggas don't give a fuck and they are not my artist
Line a nigga up, but they are not my barbers
The black man, I want to see the black man having chicken
The woman is influenced by the gram, so she stripping
The other man be running it up, big money he be tripping
My left hand be arguing with my right hand when I'm whipping
Choppers under the cabinets, kitchen drawers and coaches
In the broken down public houses, where nerds get no passes
Got a glue trap for the mouses and a shovel for you snakes
What I say behind your back, I say it to your face

[Chorus: G Perico]
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout shit
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout shit

[Verse 2: G Perico]
Yeah look
Shh, be quiet, niggas stop talking so much start sliding
I'm deaf to the bullshit, bullshit, niggas talking bullshit
Cali niggas with an FNN and a full clip
Rich crip, rich gangbanger, still in the hood one million dollars later
Still in the hood after all the times they raided
Fucked around and became number one of my generation
Woke up with a view of the city, 655, 50 bitch come ride with me
I got choices, can't hear you niggas voices
Can't stop a ghetto nigga that's focused, bitch I'm explosive
Nigga I'm the shit, bitch I'm the nigga you've been tryna fuck with
Ain't got time for niggas running their mouth
If you ain't talkin' bout shit, I'm out

[Chorus: G Perico & Vince Staples]
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout shit
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig (Norf Side)
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga (Yah, yah)
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout shit

[Verse 3: Vince Staples]
Watchu saying
Watcha know about me, real stump down P
Two fingers, still who bangin'
Blue line station, shoot my patient friends
Fuck the enemy, tell 'em come and get at me
Brown bandana, dub chipping with the shits
Count my stack, then I flip it then I flee
Bad bitch choosing up, hoe you know the fee
Everybody wanna be somebody 'til they rich
Niggas wanna trip, yeah pull up with the stick
Pull up with the stick, pull up, pull up with the stick
Slipping out the limp, now he shooting out the hip
You ain't walking round busting, you ain't talkin' bout nothing
Fo, I don't need a show stole niggas
I'm coming with a couple skinny niggas from Vallejo
Thuggin' with the draco, hunnids in the payroll

[Chorus: G Perico]
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout shit
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout nothing, nig
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, nigga
You ain't talkin' bout nothing, you ain't talkin' bout shit
