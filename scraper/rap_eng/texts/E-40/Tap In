[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
As long as you show respect, my nigga, you’ll be alright with us
(Tap in when you come in town)
You don’t wanna shoot it out or get in a fight with us
(You don’t want that)
Shorty and her friends drinkin’ up all our liquor, bitches better spend the night with us
(Drunk everything)
Crooked police, all they wanna do is lock niggas up and take our life from us
(Woo whoa, woo woo woo whoa)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Put down a demonstration on the rival
Leave a pussy ass nigga unrecognizable
Cut off the head and that’ll kill the tail
Run him down like a cheetah on a gazelle
In the suburbs, the ghetto, anything can unfold
In a white trash area, a meth lab might explode
See, that nigga over there looking hella standoffish
I don’t fuck with that hater, I fuck with bosses
The jealous be havin’ it in ‘em ‘cause we winnin’
Before rap, since the beginnin’
Longevity, got it tatted on my arm
I am to rap what Ron Jeremy is to porn
Got a reputable name, I’m concrete , practice being solid
Gotta go in like a soldier or go out like a coward
I was borderline po’, underprivileged
Laundry detergent to wash dishes…BIATCH!

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
As long as you show respect, my nigga, you’ll be alright with us
(Tap in when you come in town)
You don’t wanna shoot it out or get in a fight with us
(You don’t want that)
Shorty and her friends drinkin’ up all our liquor, bitches better spend the night with us
(Drunk everything)
Crooked police, all they wanna do is lock niggas up and take our life from us
(Woo whoa, woo woo woo whoa)

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
Mama with the shit, move the pain pills
Granny know, she go, she in the game still
Granddaddy, he shoot, he like to aim still
And now you know why we sift the bowl, the game ill
And I will spend a hundred on a EBT
Hundred dollars’ worth of meat is like sellin’ D
Check the melody, and the slow flow
And you can get it ‘round the corner at the liquor store
Little mama ho, doin’ hella bad
Took a trick on a date and stole his iPad
She be staying up late until her eyes bad
And she be full of that drama and that dry drag
Got to lyin’ bad, tryna check a check
And out of respect, I’ma send a text
‘Cause out in the West, they be on the drama
And not tappin’ in, that could really harm ya

[Chorus: Uncle Murda]
As long as you show respect, my nigga, you’ll be alright with us
(Tap in when you come in town)
You don’t wanna shoot it out or get in a fight with us
(You don’t want that)
Shorty and her friends drinkin’ up all our liquor, bitches better spend the night with us
(Drunk everything)
Crooked police, all they wanna do is lock niggas up and take our life from us
(Woo whoa, woo woo woo whoa)
