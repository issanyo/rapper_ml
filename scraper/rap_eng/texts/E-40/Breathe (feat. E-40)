[Verse 1: E-40]
I met you in the hood, lookin' good of course
Eugenia Kim hat with a Michael Kors purse
Jimmy Choo boots and Thierry Mugler cologne
All I could think about was wantin' to bone
All I could think about was takin' you home
So you could jump my bone and we could moan and groan
And get our [?] on, not a one night fling
But a long term relationship thing

[Verse 2: Blu Cantrell]
You say you love, say you love me
But you’re never there for me, yeah, (Yes I am, I am always do) mmm...hmm...
You’ll be cryin', slowly dyin'
When I decide to leave, oh, oh

[Chorus: Blu Cantrell]
All we do is make up
Then break up (that's true)
Why don’t we wake up
And see (okay)
When love hurts
It won’t work
Maybe we need some time alone (but what we need to do here?)
We need to let it breathe (okay)
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe (for sure)
Breathe

[Verse 3: Blu Cantrell]
You’re only lonely when your homie
Ain’t got a ride or no loot, yeah, uh-huh
Then comes the drama
Some other girl is claimin' she’s goin' out with you, hmm...hmm...

[Chorus: Blu Cantrell]
All we do is make up
Then break up (that's right)
Why don’t we wake up
And see
When love hurts
It won’t work (that's right)
Maybe we need some time alone (but what we need to do here?)
We need to let it breathe
Breathe
Breathe (that's right)
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe
Breathe (Uh...huh...)

[Bridge: Blu Cantrell]
Summer, spring, winter and fall
I realize, love don't love me anymore
I'm still walkin' out that door
Waitin' for a cure (c'mon)
I wish that you could love me more
And give me what I'm lookin' for (right)
You used to be the one I adore
But now it seems I'm just not sure

[Verse 4: E-40]
E-40
If I don't work you call me sorry, good for nothin'
But when I'm at work you think I'm always up to somethin'
All I'm tryna do is make the bacon and bring home some ends
I ain't cheatin' girl, you need to stop listenin' to your friends
Girl, what chu wanna do, you wanna air it out and breathe? (Breathe)
Or do you wanna work it out and cleave?
The fact of the matter is [?]
But the problem is it's a big communication gap

[Outro: Blu Cantrell]
Maybe we need some time alone
So we can just breathe (that's right)
Breathe (Let it breathe)
Breathe (Breathe, ah...)
Breathe (Let it breathe)
Breathe
Breathe (Breathe)
Breathe
Breathe (Uh-huh)

Hey... hey... hey... hey...
Let it breathe, yeah
Oh... oh... breathe
