Girl you know you
Girl you know you

[E-40]
Uh, you the baddest in the building
You look like you should have my children
Pretty face, small waist (small waist)
Big tits, dumb cakes (dumb cakes)
Where the fuck yo nigga at
I don't see him nowhere around this bitch
That nigga clown he broke I'm rich
I'm having my money
I'm having my bread
I'm having my paper
I'm having my chips
He stay at at the motel six I stay at the Ritz
My dick got replay value
His needs some help
He getting bad reviews-yelp
She staring at a nigga I ain't talking steps
Tell a nigga get to stepping you found someone else
I'm hella high right now, whiskey, twisted, and I'm lit
Give it to me, throw it at me, I don't need a catcher's mitt
Whachu got?
You got yams (yams)
You follow me on Instagram?

[Dej Loaf]
I tell you what
Meet me where it's at, all black
Twenty-one plus I be winning Blackjack
Hold the fuck up
No I ain't stuck up
I just like my guys like my shoes
Ya know, loafed up
Going with that bro stuff
I be on the go-go
Do some tricks with a nigga
Leave him hanging like a yo-yo
I ride the ride too I wasn't built for a photo
I be off that Earl Stevens, I be leaning like a photo
Hold on (40 water)
I just got a call from her man
Little rascal, alfalfa
Got a frog in his pants
I'm like ribbit
I don't fly spirit
No I ain't no dolce(?) but I hustle like I'm dancing
One door is tinted, roll it down, see a glint snow(?)
Money make me cum
Hundred thousand in my penny jar
I ain't got it in me
They ain't fucking with me
Get rich or die trying
That ain't really fucking fit me
