(ProHoeZak music)

[Chorus: Kent Jones]
Watch your hands (get up)
When we walking through (yeah)
Always remember (get up)
Who you talking to (get up)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Mob manish
This weapon in my possession'll make you vanish
I got potnas that speak Patois and Spanish
And they'll put one in your colon and your pancreas
I'm a top hat, I'm a whale, I'm a fixture, bitch, I'm a tycoon
I drink cognac like Kim Jong Un
You bound to find me chiefin' with my heaters, I'm a patient
Functioning at a party on an Indian reservation
All the youngsters, they love it, they call me 'dad'
'Cause I'm the rawest rapper the West Coast ever had
I sell liquor, music, edibles, and vegetables
I do bar mitzvahs, arenas, and hella festivals
When it comes to my jewelry, it's done right
These rappers got y'all fooled with their diamonds, them ain't real, them moissanites
My paper stuck up, it's conceited
My bank account obese, not bulimic...BIATCH!

[Chorus: Kent Jones]
Hold up, watch your hands (get up)
When we walking through (yeah)
Always remember (get up)
Who you talking to (who you talking to)
If we don't speak (we don't speak)
'Cause I don't talk to you (get up)
Always remember, never forget
Who you talking to (get up)
Who you think you talking to? Bitch, who you think you talking to? (get up)
Who you think you talking to? Bitch, who you think you talking to? (get up)
Who you think you talking to? Bitch, who you think you talking to? (get up)
Who you think you talking to?
I don't think you really know who you talking to, bitch

[Verse 2: E-40]
Players be loving the way a player move
When I go to my hood I don't get booed
Don't be a bottom feeder or a shellfish
Help your people out, don't be selfish
I Hussle like Nipsey and talk Slick like Mitchy
Desert Eagle pistol pack the Power like 50
My life is a highlight reel for real
Diarrhea of the mouth'll get you killed
I'm the oldest newest rapper in the industry
I've been spitting game for half a century
I could talk a flea off a Frenchie
Make an 18-wheeler truck pop a wheelie
The speakers in my Cut' act silly
These diamonds on the hush, quarter-milly
I'm always in a rush like I gotta pee-pee
They be hating on us 'cause they really wanna be me...BIATCH!

[Chorus: Kent Jones]
Hold up, watch your hands (get up)
When we walking through (yeah)
Always remember (get up)
Who you talking to (who you talking to)
If we don't speak (we don't speak)
'Cause I don't talk to you (get up)
Always remember, never forget
Who you talking to (get up)
Who you think you talking to? Bitch, who you think you talking to? (get up)
Who you think you talking to? Bitch, who you think you talking to? (get up)
Who you think you talking to? Bitch, who you think you talking to? (get up)
Who you think you talking to?
I don't think you really know who you talking to, bitch
