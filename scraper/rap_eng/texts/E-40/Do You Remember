[Intro: E-40]
Let me take 'em far back, man

[Verse 1: E-40]
Reminiscing, talking about the times we missing
Zeus amp overload, Zap board clippin'
Bumping Too $hort, E-40, gas, brake, dippin'
A zip and a 40, and some bad women
Remember the Fresh Fest? That was the best
We used to sit in the nose bleeds and smoke a spliff
Sess bag, hella seeds, what would we stress
When the South used to fuck with the West
Coast, doing the most
Candy apple paint, star wires, and Vogues
Fat bank, penitentiary pose
Everybody eating, fly brand new clothes
This is a family affair, a family reunion
A special occasion, we barbeque'n
We had to bring this OG shit back
Had to get Battlecat on the track

[Hook: Battlecat (talkbox)]
Do you remember the games we played?
I feel the same way
So come on over and let me have my way
Let's freak tonight, ooh, baby

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
Croaker sacks, Cadillacs on sacks
All fat, smoke, bounce
Half an ounce off that
Watching that Cadillac off that
Candy drip up and down front back
On that floss that, lost in transition
Just reminiscing
Of the days of the homies in the flipping pigeons
We live for the moment and we love living
Do you remember every September
On the hoes bumper, Alpine's bumping
System overload, gotta find something
To get in next summer, the ends kept coming
Smoking on tree, the bomb EP
Indica and Thai, we rolling on three
Take you, awake you
To make you feel how I feel my nigga
Can you relate to a Dogg Pound gangsta

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
I'm waiting on the mothership
On some Parliament Funkadelic shit
When I was ten, it wasn't Too $hort pimpin'
I was at the Coliseum watching George Clinton
I see these grey hairs on my chin
But I swear, I'm feeling young again
'Cause back in '76, I dreamed of being rich but never like this
And now I'm beginning to see
All the memories are so clear to me
You just wanna make a better world for your kids
But it's hard when you try to tell your girl what it is
Then you think about your mama and all the drama
She still raised you
You still wanna buy a house for her somewhere safe and sound
Loving all this money we making now

[Hook x2]
