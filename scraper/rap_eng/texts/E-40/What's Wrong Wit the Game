40 Water, what's wrong wit the game though?
I don't know

4-Tay, what's wrong wit the game though?
I don't know

[Verse 1: Rappin' 4-Tay]
I keeps my distance from haters because I'm quick to flash
They irritates me with a passion, I tap that ass
Be quick to blast, the game just ain't the same no more
You doing too much, pump your brakes, slow your roll
Fucking up the hustle with this beef and shit
It's too much legal tender on my agenda to bite off any
But if you play me, I gots no choice to put you in check
I ain’t playing with a full deck
You can get the business end next

[Verse 2: E-40]
See I'm a business man with a set of big balls
Marketing meetings and, uh, conference calls
You say you work for a living, huh?
Nigga, what the fuck you think I do? This shit ain’t easy
Everything ain’t always fa sheezy
A nigga can't even sit down with his family
And be straight and have a decent dinner
Without a motherfucker yelling, "Weepalation!”
"What I got to do to get you on my compilations?" (compilations)
I charge 30 but I’ll do the shit for you for free (for you for free)
On the strength that you was down with a nigga when I was sellin’ D, uh

[Talkbox]
I can’t get caught up in this game
I can’t trust nobody, that’s why
I stack my chips and get paid
What’s wrong with the game, mayne?

[Verse 3: Rappin' 4-Tay]
What's the world coming to when niggas talk down for fun
I’m  Rappin' 4-Tay, it don't make me none
‘Cause popularity don't mean that much
‘Cause if it don't make dollars I don't really give a fuck
Jocking all up under my name but you don't even know me
Got me fucked up with one of them suckers, one of your so-called homies
Now that’s the shit that’ll cause a mack to be quick to bring the pain
When niggas go against the grain, 40 Water, what's wrong with the game?

[Verse 4: E-40]
I'm ten years strong in this shit, marbles up to par
A nigga got nigga rich by selling tapes out the trunk of the car
I purchased and built a 9,000 square foot state of the art George Jetson mansion
Big ass improvement from Magazine Street, big ass expansion
I seen it in my dream when I was nine years old
My mama always told me to, uh, achieve my goal
Keep a cool head and, uh, respect a dollar
Never get too greedy for the money and power

[Talkbox]
I can’t get caught up in this game
I can’t trust nobody, that’s why

[Verse 5: E-40]
The reason I carry Glock 26 on my side of my hip ‘cause I ain't thumping
Man, these niggas nowadays act like you owe them something
Always talking about, "40, show me some love! (show me some love!)"
Just because I got a, a hustle in my blood
They want to knock ME
‘Cause I don't blossom like a sunflower SEED
Surrounded by problems, you see the Jacuzzi, smoking big WEED
Drinking white Zinfandel (Zinfandel) yes INDEED
Born and raised in Vallejo (BIATCH!)

[Verse 6: Rappin' 4-Tay]
The game done got foul and bogus
So all my true player partners, y'all just stay focused
And watch them haters ‘cause they plots on a daily basis
Hustlers, servers, traders that caught so many dope cases
And bailed out with the quickness
If those G's was right, if that game was tight
Ballers had get back, wasn’t no such thing as three strikes
No sense in fucking mines off, but I'm off parole and shit
Niggas get to running off at the mouth just like a snitch, some like a bitch
(BIATCH!)
