[Hook: Stressmatic]
My rear view mirror is vibrating (vibrating) (2x)
The beat keeps knockin down my rear view mirror (2x)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Say uh
Which way should I steer uh?
The beat keeps knockin down my rear view mirror
Blankin like a motherfucka swervin'
Hope I don't bap in my 2010 suburban
BEATCH!
My right pocket be feudin with my left pocket
Cuz my left pocket be havin a thumper in it
My left pocket be feudin with my right pocket
Cuz my right pocket be havin mo money in it
See that chick right there? she a lil ol' slut
She said e-40's a FILF. FILF?
Father I Like to Fuck
I said "lil girl, you way too young for me
What you need to do is go and get your mommy
I heard she's got some vicious dome action
Gobble game is fire
Suction cup lips, suck the air out a tire"
Hips butt tits bitch call me sire
And I won't stop Mack-in' till I retire
BEATCH!

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
It's cookies in my swisher
Boy like the blunt
It's dub 7s in my trunk bout to make shit jump
I do my own stunts, this my favorite one
Dick stickin in the same position till the bitch c*m
& baby I'm the one, cold as a glacier
Heart like coal in the soul of a gangster
& I can make you famous
Better yet dangerous
Courageous, leave the game so contagious
Outrageous, amazin', I keep the shit blazin'
Can't nobody face 'em only money can persuade 'em
Bottles by the cases, models get wasted
Diamonds in my chain, some more up in my bracelet
Pocket full of paper
Miss me with that fake shit
The 40 cal will spit till somethin' get hit
Honor thy mother, but fuck these bitches
I keep the game vicious, I'm ridiculous (I'm ridiculous)
