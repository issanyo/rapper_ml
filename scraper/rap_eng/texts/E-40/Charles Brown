[Chorus: Jay Ant & G-Eazy]
I'm tryna' know what the future holds
But it ain't for you to know
I treat my self like the usual
But it ain't for you to know
I'm thinkin' clear, never losin' hope
But it ain't for you to know (It ain't for you to know)
Tell myself like usual (That's it)
But it ain't for you to know (Yeah)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
Sometimes I gotta be dolo alone, just walkin' around
Young Gerald, young Charlie Brown
Some shit's better to keep to yourself than say aloud
Some shit you see and they don't, so I simply jot it down
It was written, had the vision as a youth that I would make it here one day
A flight to the top, cop a one-way
But looking out the window on the subway, 16, slapping Mac Dre
Somehow I always knew it'd be that way
I felt this so clear it's like a rode a time machine and I saw it
I paint the picture and draw it, I fold it up in my wallet
Keep it with me everywhere I go just as a reminder
Told myself every time I get discouraged or tired
I got greatness inside of me
I go against the greats until they tired of me
I've heard it all, nothing surprises me
See, I'm the one, I'm the anomaly
But never mind me, I'll just be up over here killing 'em quietly
You know?

[Chorus: Jay Ant & G-Eazy]
I'm tryna' to know what the future holds (Tryna know)
But it ain't for you to know (It ain't for you to know)
I treat my self like the usual (Just keep it to myself and keep it moving)
But it ain't for you to know (You know?)
I'm thinkin' clear, never losin' hope
But it ain't for you to know
Tell myself like usual
But it ain't for you to know

[Interlude: G-Eazy]
Yeah, and I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised, tomorrow or today
From the Bay, like 40 and Dre
So I'mma do it in a major way
I said, I heard 'em say
Nothing's ever promised, tomorrow or today
From the Bay, like 40 and Dre
Chasing dreams, it's the only way

[Verse 2: E-40]
I'm still here, remember these lyrics
And when I'm dead and gone, I'll be there in spirit
Don't let 'em run my name in the mud, don't let 'em smear it
Just pour some Rossi out, go ahead and tear it
One of a kind, no copy
Tell your grandchildren's children 'bout me
Tell 'em I was the illest
Let 'em know I spit the realest
Went from pennies and nickels to large amounts
Kept it in the hood, where it counts
Never was them, always was him
Had to prove myself, time and time again
Just when they thought it was it, he back with another hit
We brought the Bay to the rest of the world (who was it?)
E-40 and Gerald

[Chorus: Jay Ant]
I'm tryna' to know what the future holds
But it ain't for you to know
I treat my self like the usual
But it ain't for you to know
I'm thinkin' clear, never losin' hope
But it ain't for you to know
Tell myself like usual
But it ain't for you to know

[Verse 3: G-Eazy]
So where I go from here?
I did the most you could possibly pack into a year
Now I can either fall off and completely disappear
Or, I can move up to the highest tier
Conversations with Gerald, standing in front the mirror
Ask myself like "Fuck the bullshit, what you really fear?"
We all want to be understood, hope they hear us clear
But that shit never happens everywhere
So I just do me on my "fuck the world" shit
I'm riding through the town listening to Earl's shit
Been trying to lift the Bay up, I could probably curl it
I learn from the legends, they tell me "you're it"
So I always maintain and try to stay sane
But, just do you, give a fuck what they sayin'
We artists are all alike, we feel the same pain
You want the whole world? You want the same thing

[Chorus: Jay Ant]
I'm Tryna' to know what the future holds
But it ain't for you to know
I treat my self like the usual
But it ain't for you to know
I'm thinkin' clear, never losin' hope
But it ain't for you to know
Tell myself like usual
But it ain't for you to know
