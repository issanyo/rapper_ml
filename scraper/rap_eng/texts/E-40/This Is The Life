[Chorus]
This is the life
All of the things we both go thru (x2)

[Verse 1]
Ugh, I’m lookin at it from the inside lookin out not the outside lookin in
Sittin here writing with my pen wondering who really my friend
If I die today will they try to get at my broad, my bitch
On some old double back and I always had eyes for her type a shit
Ain't no tellin this one or really told anything else
Don’t nothin surprise me or amaze me these days It’s crazy
I survived and made it thru the sickest toughest times the 80’s
The crack epidemic, over head singdromas, smoking crack outta tv antennas and blood donors
When it was organized game not organized lame
When niggas had some real reasons to put some change in ya brain
When we practically lived on i5 on our way to La La Land
To recap hurry up during the dry season
This beat tremble(tremble)  throbbing the trunk (throbbing the trunk) am sitting in the car rollin a dealer blunt (dealer blunt)
Right hand on my thumb incase they think I’m a cunt california didn’t raise no punk

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let me touch down on some real subjects man
You know a lot of people goin thru this man touch down man

[Verse 2]
We try’na get off mortgage loans yall tell us to stop makin payments
Black people been hoodwinked and bamboozled denied of modifications
Get set up for foreclosure then yall take it ova
Now we sleepin in our cars man that ain't cousure
They say we gotta do better so amma take it there
Can’t afford health care but can afford hair
And a new pairs a jordans probably got two pays
Designer rims, tyres and a spare
We got our priorities fucked up but that’s life
You in the books am in the ass shooting dice
Wanna move my kids up out the hood and spoil em right
But in the suburbs they got drugs like Roxy Cot
I got one foot on my pool pit and one foot on my block
One hand on the bible and one on my Glock
Am wondering how much time nigga I got left on my clock
Before chillin out in thug mansion with my partna 2Pac
Ugh

[Chorus]
