[Hook]
So many hun’eds, man, this bitch want four
A nigga hold off getting 20 below
I’m a corner boy standing by the liquor store
Summertime big bread outta control
Street money, street money, street money
Street money, street money, we get street money
Street money, street money, street money
Street money, street money, street money

[Verse 1:  E-40]
My nigga sitting in the penitentiary, blame it on an all-white jury
Mistaken identity, right? ‘Cause all blacks look alike
Every time I look in the mirror, I look at the struggle
I trip off myself like “What?”
Shooting my dice and rolling my weed, we huddled up in a hut
Conversatin’ and congregatin’, me and my block baboons
Choppin’ it up and marinatin’ on what’s the next moves
Should I try another field, or should I continue to sell wind chill
Live on the hill like Neil, Diamond and get my scrill
I ain’t ever, cashed a check in my life, I wanted the fast quarter
All my spots in my bitch’s name, pay my bills in money orders
I came in the game on empty, left out the game with plenty
Clean as fuck on skinny, own a KFC or a Denny’s
That’s the plan of every black man that been sold a dream or two
I wanna walk in his steps, but I can’t fit in his shoe
I’m walking into the liquor, gangsta want me to buy him a brew
A pack of swishers and some Newports
I told him “I used to be just like you”

Summertime big bread outta control
Street money, street money, street money
Street money, street money, we get street money
Street money, street money, street money
Street money, street money, street money

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
When it’s all about money and sex, I’m a psychic
I put it up for sale and let the next man buy it
I’m in love with the hustle, when I add it all up
I need storage space, I didn’t know I had all this stuff
I’m always spending money ‘cause I make so much of it
It’s good pussy, all I wanna do is fuck it
Quick paper, I get it all the time
You can talk shit later, I spend it if it’s mine
I make my money double on a whole new level
It’s trouble, I love it, but I don’t love you
Don’t lose your fuckin’ mind, just stay cool
It’s not the end of the world, I gotta stay full
And it’s all dirty, ‘cause it came from the streets
You can call my girls, and run some game on them freaks
It’s in your budget—if it’s not, don’t touch it
I’m all about them ducats
