[Verse 1: E-40]
Err'where I go I tycoon and work my [?]
I'm block deep, do it big, I got a baller [?]
Bar none, ten times out of ten I'mma have my gun (I'mma have my gun)
We pop pistols while you suckas be poppin' bubble gum (*Pop!*)
Not in a marching band, but we like to play with drums (play with drums)
50 rounds, 100 rounds, my Uzi weighs a to-, a ton (a ton)
In the club you get super slum, we crunk like Lil Jon
If you go do the A-Town Stomp, throw your hood up if you ain't no punk

You can dodge it and hide, trippin' and slippin' (trippin' and slippin')

Smokin' dre, gettin' cake, the block is what I bleed
Sellin' coke as I eat (ayy), my team is in the lead (what else?)
I gotta stay paid (uhh!), there's money to be made
And I'mma spin every penny 'cause I can't take it to the grave
The watch on my wrist, the diamonds in my ear
The ice on my necklace shine like a chandelier (like a chandelier)
I'm a professional "sucka-ducka", I'm having my dough (where you from?)
Where I'm from you ain't gotta join the army to go to war (what else?)
The whip that I slide, the shit that I drive
Speakers and [?] sound like a concert inside (like a concert inside)
Candy so wet, look like my car been cryin'
You gotta see it yourself, it's kinda hard for me to describe (ooouh!)
The road that I chose, the path that I took
The bakin' soda, Yola and [?] that I cooked
The [?] that I keep just spend most of their time in prison (where at?)
Terminal Island, Tallahassee and Saint Quentin
I'm a..
