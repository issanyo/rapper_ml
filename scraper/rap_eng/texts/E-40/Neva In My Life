[Chorus: Show Banga]
I don’t think I’ma ever trust a nigga
I don’t think I’ma ever trust a ho
I don’t think I’ma never trust a nigga
I don’t think I’ma ever trust a ho
Never in my life (Huh)
Never in my life (Huh, huh)
Never in my life
Never in my life
Never in my life
Never in my life
Never in my life

[Verse 1: Show Banga]
Got zero trust, I just get the bucks
Don’t do too much, I just do my stuff
Was sleepin’ on me but you’re outta luck
I get that gualla when I’m showin’ up
And it’s just the beginning
They mad that we winning, I’m happy you didn’t
(Oh, why?) ‘Cause you don’t deserve it
Like James, boy, I’m Worthy; I ball with no jersey
No job but still splurgin’
A real one, you heard me, the baddies so thirsty
They just wanna slurp me
Lord, please have some mercy; for that bread, I’m lurkin’

[Chorus: Show Banga + E-40]
I don’t think I’ma ever trust a nigga
I don’t think I’ma ever trust a ho
I don’t think I’ma never trust a nigga
I don’t think I’ma ever trust a ho
Never in my life (In my life) (Huh)
Never in my life (In my life) (Huh, huh)
Never in my life (In my life)
Never in my life (In my life)
Never in my life
Never in my life

[Verse 2: E-40]
UH, I don’t fuck her no more (Fuck her no more)
I don’t wanna beat that dead horse no more (Unh-uh)
She was ho from the be-gate, it’s over
Her breath needed Colgate—odor
Potty-moutheded heifers get penalized (Penalized)
Made her rent a car for me at Enterprise (Enterprise)
I’ll be gone ‘til the month of May, they call it Gemini (Gemini)
Out the country, out the state, might be in Dubai (Dubai)
I dibbled and I dabbled and I straddled the fence (Straddled the fence)
I’m a Giant like Hunter Pence (Hunter Pence)
They taught me on the gravel: never tell, never snitch (Tell, never snitch)
Don’t trust nobody, never go to war over a bitch (BIATCH!)

[Chorus: Show Banga + E-40]
I don’t think I’ma ever trust a nigga
I don’t think I’ma ever trust a ho
I don’t think I’ma never trust a nigga
I don’t think I’ma ever trust a ho
Never in my life (In my life) (Huh)
Never in my life (In my life) (Huh, huh)
Never in my life (In my life)
Never in my life (In my life)
Never in my life
Never in my life (BIATCH!)
