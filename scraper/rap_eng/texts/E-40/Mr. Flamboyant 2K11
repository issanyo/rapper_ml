[Singing: E-40]
I was out there on the yola track
Try'na make my motherfuckin money back
Po-po beat me up and took all of my feddy
Uhh! All my feddy
I think they almost had enough to cop me two or three
Two of O-Z's of that good candy
But I was goin take just a second for me to get back on my toes and feet
On my toes and feet [laughs] uhh
BEATCH!

[Rapping: E-40]
Yeah, this one of em throwback, mobbed out, yola coppin'
Truck robbin', sparks some kush, crack a bottle and sip some yac beats
Muthafucka, crack a bottle and sip some yac beats
Mutha-muthafucka
Yeah, this one of em throwback, mobbed out, yola coppin'
Truck robbin', sparks some kush, crack a bottle and sip some yac beats
Muthafucka, crack a bottle and sip some yac beats
Mutha-muthafucka

[Verse 1:]
When I was born I was designed to be a boss
Good to be able to deal with anything that I came across (came across)
Uhh! Threw off men cause I'm wore this glasses to avoid now smiled ta' cross when I was out there in the traffic, be flicking and serving knocks
A place in the danger street used to make that till you shoot pella soft bee-bees
One of the most faithful weapons of choice remington rifles 223's
Styrofoam and plastic fresh out the box with the cleaning kit
I was quiet and I was slick but if you fuck with me I empty the clip, uhh
Basically me and my goons was overseeing and my realest was scrillion dolla spot
It was my job I got Brenton to hold down the whole muthafuckin block
Now I'm the nigga I'm that dude I'm the man (I'm the man)
This shit I spittin' niggas don't understand
BEATCH!

I'm gonna give you ten percent of the take
I'm gonna give you ten percent of the take
You got enough stuff in here to send us up for life
You got enough stuff in here to send us up for life
I didn't try an take it over, I took it over
I did-I did-I did-I did-I didn't try and take it over, I took it over
You got enough stuff in here to send us up for life
You got enough stuff in here to send us up for life
Mr. Flamboyant

[Verse 2:]
Mr. Flamboyant, yeah, yeah that just might be yo handle
Blackjack, craps, roulette, high rolling love ta gamble
Whole water like a Campbell, never tell or never snitch
On a mission to get rich, slap the shit up out a bitch (beatch)
I'm a fixture having chips, been doing it for a grip
Might not gangbang but I set trip
I been out here 24/7 nothing more, nothing less
Written my ass off, smelling like feet, butt and breath
In the mean time in between time I be mobbin' (mobbin')
Backing and dodging Batman and Robin (Robin)
Living my life in the fast lane no jogging
Capitalizing and taking advantage every time I hear money calling
They tell me I need to be pumpin' my brakes I'm movin too quick, I'm rushing
I open a nigga up I'll bust my gun mane I ain't bluffing
Million musclin' hustlin' try'na get this cake
My hood didn't breed no chimpanzee my hood breeded a ape
Sinister mob music, excruciation throb
Two 12's and four 8's in the trunk, doin' it's fuckin' job
I'm hella far from being a punk, all my life I been a hog
Don't lift free weights, benchpress just couch, refrigerators and walls
In the Bay we got earthquakes, in the south they got tornado
In the Midwest and the east coast either rain, sleeted or snizow
When it comes to pushing I'm a pro, clever about the moves I make
Legal with my ideals and choices that I choose to chose to take
Beeatch! (beotch)

Be kinda careful what'chu say
Be kinda-be kinda-be kinda careful what'chu say
You just try and cross me and see if I mean it
You just try and cross me and see if I mean it
You intend exposing me to the police?
You intend, you intend, you intend exposing me to the police?
You just try and cross me and see if I mean it
You just try and cross me and see if I mean it
Mr. Flamboyant

[Verse 3:]
See he cures, he trees trim em' and put em in plastic baggies
Medicine draws, saran wraps, FedEx or UPS
Whatever you need I got it at your request
Got the lowest prices in tantums as far as quality got the best
Me and my niggas don't take no mess
You real niggas probably don't ever
Everybody gotta squeezer these days, rifles and SK's
Stuck in my stubborn ways, hella mannish with it
Magnums and 12gauge, do damage with it
Whoopin em at they own game, all the po-po know my name
My fame bigger than my bank, although I'm having change
You can find me at the shooting range perfecting and practicing my aim
Me and my young life, knuckleheads, Thunder Cats and hooligans
The only way to get out is to go in
So cover me I'm going in like Daniel in the Lion's Den
Roll with us or get rolled over man, crushed a swad a beer can
The only man I fear is in the mirror man
BEATCH!

I've been waiting for a break like this for years
I've been waiting for a break like this for years
Aye why didn't you tell us you were such a big shot?
Aye why didn't you tell us you were such a big shot?
Mr. Flamboyant
I've been waiting for a break like this for years

Aye why didn't you tell us you were such a big shot?
Aye why-aye why didn't you tell us you were such a big shot?
