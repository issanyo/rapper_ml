[Verse 1]
I'm a winner, not a loser (winning)

Corporate meetings, that's how I get my bands up (winning)
I'm trying to build my brands up (winning)
Out here it's dangerous, it's shitty just like an anus
Don't give a fuck who you is, it don't matter how rich or famous
I got hunters on my squad that my hunters don't even know
And they'll turn your ass to a Jane or a John Doe
