[Reporter:]
This topping of news right now surveillance cameras
Captured a terrifying attack at a store in Vallejo

[Chorus: Raw Smoov]
Ridin' through the turf, on Magazine
You know I stay strapped, with a magazine
Put it to your face, like a magazine
I stay on the case, 'cause I'm from Magazine
Nigga I'm from Hillside
H-I-L-L-S-I-D-E
Nigga I'm from Hillside
H-I-L-L-S-I-D-E

[Verse 1:]
H-I-L-L-S-I-D-E
M-A-G-A-Z-I-N-E- Vallejo, California my city
No pity, for a sucka can't be no sissy
Motherfuckers smoke weed like a hippy, get tipsy, like Wine-O's, stay whisky
Country ass city boys with hunting rifles bring the ruckus
Beverly Hillbillies big old corn-fed motherfuckers
What'cha need my nigga, got every narcotic in the world for sale
I ain't Wayne Brady but let's make a deal
Like Drew Carey, mane the price is right
I got pills, trees and that white white white
The Hillside, have money have heart
Just like the Watts tower we got the Kittywalk
That's the hood landmark like John Davidson Park
Cutlass, Oldsmobiles, 'stangs, Cougars and 'larks
Posted with thumps ginormous oversize guns
Me and my potnas my brothers and my cousins

[Chorus: Raw Smoov]
Ridin' through the turf, on Magazine
You know I stay strapped, with a magazine
Put it to your face, like a magazine
I stay on the case, 'cause I'm from Magazine
Nigga I'm from Hillside
H-I-L-L-S-I-D-E
Nigga I'm from Hillside
H-I-L-L-S-I-D-E

[Verse 2:]
Uhh!
When I was a young cub a lion though a young cat baby buffalo
Money and muscle born in the struggle, turf wars not tug-a-war
Shootouts, high speeds, on top of the roof and trees
On the side of the house with gauges, rifles and .223's
Back then it used to be pagers not WiFi and 4G
When I was seventeen me and my crew went half on a key
Now I'm making more in a day then my momma making a week
Jewelry, clothes, new shoes on my feet
Having my cabbage hella slap a lavish trunk full of throb
Woofers, tweeters and horns, doing they fuckin' job
Getting 'em up throwin' 'em, bobbing and weaving beastin'
Knuckling up with OGs in the middle of the street in
Earning my stripes and medal no bronze or silver just gold
Pea coats in the summer, even when it ain't cold
I throw my H in the sky, everywhere I go nationwide
If they ask you where I'm from, tell 'em Hillside

[Chorus: Raw Smoov]
Ridin' through the turf, on Magazine
You know I stay strapped, with a magazine
Put it to your face, like a magazine
I stay on the case, 'cause I'm from Magazine
Nigga I'm from Hillside
H-I-L-L-S-I-D-E
Nigga I'm from Hillside
H-I-L-L-S-I-D-E

[Verse 3:]
Alhambra, Beverly Drive, La Brea
Earl Street, Carmel, Didion Court, Wilshire
Hollywood Ave, Volute, Magazine Street rolling
Half of my cash yokin', punching the gas smokin'
[?] parking my car in the grass feeling good
Sitting on top of the hood flea flicking and serving knocks pushing bags, giving them love, joogs
24 hour shift and grittin' everyday all day
7-11 turf burrito livin' warmed up in a microwave
Hillside for life, always been about my bread
Look up to Alick, Rick Young, Too-Shay, Ju Ju and OG Nitch
Jon Jon and Robert Craig, Victor, Cook and Tyrone and them
Miss Smith and Loney Smurf, Jimmy Blackman and all of them
See the spot right here, this used to be Mr. Jimmy's
Why give a Wine-O a dollar to buy a beer for me?
Around the corner from the Travelodge and Mickey D
You 'lible to find me at the Kit-Way Bowling alley
BIATCH!

[Chorus: Raw Smoov]
Ridin' through the turf, on Magazine
You know I stay strapped, with a magazine
Put it to your face, like a magazine
I stay on the case, 'cause I'm from Magazine
Nigga I'm from Hillside
H-I-L-L-S-I-D-E
Nigga I'm from Hillside
H-I-L-L-S-I-D-E
