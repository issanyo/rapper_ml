Oh, yeah? Oh

[Chorus: Vell & E-40]
I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', I'm mobbin', my nigga

I'm mobbin', I'm mobbin', my nigga
Straight MOB, M-O-B, M-O-B
Straight MOB, M-O-B, M-O-B
Mobbin'

[Verse 1: Vell]
Been mobbin' since a lil nigga
Been getting money since trill nigga
So you know I keep it on me
Catch a nigga playing, pop him at his long sleeve
Need weed, I'ma call up Skee
I was down for 10 months, they was yelling for me (Free Vell)
First day out, I was back on that bullshit
Messed up outside trying to hit a lick
Niggas see my Instagram so they think I'm rich
So I'm buyin' every gun and every fuckin' clip
Gotta stay on point, never get caught slippin'
Never take  my chain, Vell hit and quick splittin'

[Chorus: Vell & E-40]
I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', I'm mobbin', my nigga
Straight MOB, M-O-B, M-O-B
Straight MOB, M-O-B, M-O-B
Mobbin'

[Verse 2: E-40]
I got a 6-7 Cougar and it's the truth (The truth)
It got a V8, I ain't talking about tomato juice (Tomato juice)
Without the trauma plate, what good is a 'proof? (A 'proof)
Put your hands over your head, guard your roof (Guard your roof)
Free my niggas in the shoe, not Mother Goose (Mother Goose)
You ain't the boss of me, nigga, fuck a truce (Fuck a truce)
I make a sucker disappear like poof (Like poof)
And no OG's in my ear, that's my excuse (My excuse)
UH, I'm mobbin', my nigga (My nigga)
I'm on and I'm full of this liquor (And I'm full of this liquor)
I'm mobbin', my nigga (My nigga)
My foreign got dealership stickers
She wanna smoke me out, she on me, she know I'm a boy, brodie
She know I'm swaggish and sauce-ish, she know I carry it bossy
I'm a master at funking, I got my funking degree
Beat your car up with the deuce-deuce-three, BIATCH!

[Chorus: Vell & E-40]
I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', I'm mobbin', my nigga
Straight MOB, M-O-B, M-O-B
Straight MOB, M-O-B, M-O-B
Mobbin'

[Verse 3: Ezale]
I got to carve him up
Thought he wanted me to move something (We can move something)
But he wanted me to do something (We can do something)
Can't tell you 'cause I never been a dry snitch
Just know its a plan to get rich (For real, for real)
Mob shit, bitch, I know you know
Used to rock with them niggas but I don't no more
And I thought he was lil but I heard he tote
So I can't affiliate, you know how that go
What you know about being in the mob, nigga?
It's for life, fuck a full-time job, nigga
Right here you ain't playin' for keeps
If you live by the gun, you can die by the two-two-threes

[Chorus: Vell & E-40]
I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', my nigga
I'm mobbin', I'm mobbin', my nigga
Straight MOB, M-O-B, M-O-B
Straight MOB, M-O-B, M-O-B
Mobbin'
