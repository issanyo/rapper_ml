[Intro: Dr. Cornel West]
What kind of human beings are we really?
What has gone into the shaping and molding of who we are
Both as persons as well as communities and traditions?
The inescapability of traditions
For me the greatest tradition is spiritual fortitude in the modern world, which is the black musical tradition
There's never been a tradition on such intimate terms of catastrophe and still able to generate such unbelievable forms of creativity, compassion, and fortitude

[Verse 1: E-40]
When it was my aisle turn to get up and view the casket
Couldn't hold my tears back, it was automatic
When the reverend started preaching, it was sad
After the funeral, I hugged his mom and dad
Paid for the memorial, 7000 dollars cash
Only time we get together is when somebody pass
The story of many people I narrate
Hella hate divide and conquer, separate
When I was born, momma didn't feed any baby food to this infant
She fed me collard greens, dressing, candied yams, and fried chicken
In the trenches, we trippin', got trials and tribulations
Renovation, they forcing us out, gentrification
Living in the Bay, it's expensive, it's hard to bargain
2500 a month to rent a 1 bedroom apartment
Cancer don't care how old you are or who you are (no, no, no)
Live your life every day like it's no tomorrow (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Health can be your best friend or worst enemy, could be ruthless
Lou Gehrig's Disease, leukemia, and lupus
No Medi-Cal insurance so we self-medicate
Eat tomatoes 'cause it helps protect the prostate
Some of my potnas vegan, some just watch the way they eat
Substitute ground turkey for ground beef, no red meat
It's mainey outchea, it's murkish and it's sick
Everybody outchea carry and pack a pogo stick

[Chorus: Mike Marshall + (E-40)]
Life for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)
Yeah, life is much different 'round here (Uh)
But we don't give up
In God we trust
When life shows up around here (Shows up)
Sometimes it's unfair around here (It's unfair)
But we still rise up (Uh)

[Verse 2: E-40]
Every day somebody fighting for they life
Every second it's a body put on ice
Maggots, flies, vultures, parasites
Tag on they toe without a price
In the middle of the slums rockin' crumbs
Secondhand smoke all in our lungs
Weikel's, Smart & Final, Target
You liable to find me up in Chavez Supermarket
The homie's kids and his nephews tryna rap
Say that's the only way to get up out the trap
Gettin' on somethin' they only content
I tell them they can be an astronaut or an accountant
Can't wait to get papered up with designer belt on my pants
Do the money dance with the money phone in my hand
Loved ones in a situation and need some cash?
Send it through Square Cash, they'll get it fast
When I finally catch a break, it's voodoo
Every time I catch a break, it fall through
Life is against me, the devil's on me
He shady, he janky, he ain't my homie
Temptation is vicious, you gotta watch all these bitches
They'll line you up with no clippers, do anything for they niggas
Life is an assignment, it's a test
Repent, thank God, and confess

[Chorus: Mike Marshall + (E-40)]
Oh, life for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)
Yeah, life is much different 'round here (What you say?)
But we don't (we don't) give up (give up)
In God we trust
When life shows up around here (whoa)
Sometimes it's unfair around here (It's unfair)
But we still rise up (look here)
Life for us it's just different 'round here (It's different)
Yeah life is much different 'round here (it's so different round here)
But we don't give up (it's so different round here)
In God we trust
When life shows up around here (when life shows up)
Sometimes it's unfair around here (life shows up)
But we still rise up (well...)

[Outro: Dr. Cornel West]
'Cause I'm a Jesus loving free Black man
But I was in deep solidarity and remain so
With the focus on those poor, precious, priceless children
Even today, one out of two black and brown children live in poverty
