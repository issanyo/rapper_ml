[Intro: E-40]
(“Valley Joe…Vall-Vall-Vall-Valley Joe”)
Yeah, you got The C-L-I-C-K in the palace doing some of that state of the art funk
(“It’s a party…party…party…party…”)

[Verse 1: E-40]
It’s a party in the V-town, so come and gather around
I’m claiming my town from the lost and found
The time is now for me to brag and boast
About Vallejo, California, straight poppin’ the most
The Valley Joe, north Bay, 20 minutes from Frisco
The home of the potent dope brothers, The Click, bro
And who are these brothers that I’ve been hearing about, The Click?
The word on the streets is that they comin’ up too quick
Them the rappers from the Valley that got kinda bold
They think they got the industry hecka sown
Independent label’s going almost gold
I think that we deserve us a spot on the globe
I’m tired of people say, “Where y’all from?”
And then I tell ‘em then sit up there and look at me dumb
They say, “Unh-unh, potna, you’re too dope, it can’t be
I thought it was nothin’ but marks in the V”
Fool, it’s a party

[Chorus]
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, it’s a party
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, it’s a party
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, it’s a party
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
707 is the area code
So click your mind to Bay Area mode
The story is told, it’s the city of funk
Not only with the Glocks and sawed off pumps
But brothers like us, riding the bassline
Giving your time a taste of mine
Vallejo, California, you know what I mean?
You might not make it when the light turn green
But if you do, then it’s cool to lounge
Just don’t be a new fool in town
And try to battle ‘cause that’s absurd
And you and B-Legit gon’ have some words
And all I’ma do is call up Tone
Hit a little dank and this fonk is on
And then I’m known for that mob sound
Comin’ from the party in the V-town

[Chorus]
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
(It’s a party in the V-town)
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
(It’s a party in the V-town)
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah

[Verse 3: E-40]
It ain’t nothin’ like the real thing, sick slang, The Click, mayne
Making a bunch of noise in the V, mayne
Speaking up for my lane, gravel, soil, and a little pissed though
The 707 area code ain’t recognized enough
Come on out to the Southside lake
Nothin’ but ballers, Beverly Hills sohabs
Bettin’ on Rottweilers, kickin’ it hecka tight, cars looking right
Everybody’s on hit, barbecuing throughout the night
Then we mob on out in a big ol’ gigantic Suburban
Nothin’ but a bunch of females, brought my ass to pervin’
The good times, we hit Reno
We play craps, Blackjack, and keno

[Chorus]
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, it’s a party
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, it’s a party
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, it’s a party
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah

[Verse 4: B-Legit]
Nineteen-hundred-and-ninety-uno
V-town, mayne, and I think that you know
The Click is up and we Sick Wid It
And it ain’t too many that can get wit’ it
You see, the style I use and the words I slang
Is just like flippin’ new Vogues and zeens
Round and round and I watch ‘em go
I gotta say “what’s up” to my DJ, though
Cold as ice, cool as a breeze
Spinnin’ them 360 degrees
And I know you got it kinda sick, mayne
So won’t you go and put us in the mix, mayne

[Chorus]
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
(It’s a party in the V-town)
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
(It’s a party in the V-town)
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah

It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
It’s a V-town thing, man, yeah
