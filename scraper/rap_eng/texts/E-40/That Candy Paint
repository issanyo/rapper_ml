[Hook x2: Bun B]
It's that candy paint, 84's
Belts and buckles, chrome and grill
Leather seats, stitch and tuck
TV screens and wooded wheels

[Verse 1: E-40]
That candy paint, smoking that dank, beats so loud bystanders faint
Neighborhood watch call and complain, hate on my big fat ass bank
Popo pull me over say "you a rap singer
I know you smoke weed, let me smell your finger"
Linger, that the green thumb jars
Got a valid registration and my cannabis card
I'm challenged, got candy paint on my Harley
Bike and truck, jet ski's boats and old school Cut'
Looking for a top shelf, not no more
That candy paint, got 'em gone, can't believe their eyes
Drank and dank, flabbergasted mesmerize
Digital dash, having my cash
Secret stash for my strap
Gotta shake these suckers and watch my back
I'm slapping so hard my windshield cracked
Windshield cracked? Windshield cracked!
I'm slapping so hard my windshield cracked
My old bitch jealous, put my tires on a flattest grass

[Hook x2: Bun B]
It's that candy paint, 84's
Belts and buckles, chrome and grill
Leather seats, stitch and tuck

[Verse 2: Slim Thug]
I'm addicted to this flossing that why all my rides so awesome
I keep that big 'Lac bossing, it don't matter what it's costing
Tossin' deuces out the roof, but that coupe
While I ride by, players chunking deuces back
Bopp's holl'ing out "hi!"
Feel like I'm up in the sky, gone on that bay green
40 got them going [?] when we pull up on the scene
Candy paint, looking clean, fo's looking king size
Heads turn while I drive by, it's like they can't believe their eyes
"Is that that boy Thugga and that bad motherfucka?"
Swangin', bangin', riding dirty, screwed & chopped on them suckas
Flippin', flippin', lookin', good, diamonds, diamonds 'gainst the wood
From the Texas to the Cali, catch me tippin' through the hood

It's that candy paint, 84's

[Verse 3: Bun B]
It's Screwston Texas, that's the city where we ride the greatest
Grippin' grain, drippin' stain, turnin' up, Robert Davis
That old school grey tape, a trunk poppa, plate scraper
A hustler and a grinder, every day I'm trying to make paper
I'm from PA, represent for UGK
And I'm ridin' for my city like it's Rap-A-Lot and J
I got homies on the west, I got homies in Detroit
Matter fact, this gladiator's all over, all day
Sittin' in that candy paint sideways
Pull up outta my driveway
Drop that top and let them jock, then head on out on that highway
Turn up some rig shot, or maybe Swishahouse
Now pass the kush and dump the swisha out
It's going down!
