Last night I tried…but I couldn’t drive
‘Cause I was toasted (TOASTED!)
I’m toasted (TOASTED!)
Last night I tried…but I couldn’t drive
‘Cause I was toasted (TOASTED!)
I’m toasted (TOASTED!)

[Verse 1: E-40]
I’m in this thang
Been twisted and curled, about the Earl
They call me E for everything
Even the most interesting man in the world
I live in the Bay with the crabs in the barrel
The sea lions and sharks
Where it’s colder than an ice pack
Colder than a hooker’s heart
Girl Scout cookies and Cherry Pie, we spark tree
Clear liquor and dark
I’m married to the Bay, ‘til death do us apart
I’m timeless and I’m ageless, get over it
I have the beats that slap, I could have my name written all over it
Right now, I’m whooped, hammered and toasted
Outta my character, outta my mind
Hooked on this broccoli and this burgundy Rossi wine
Cooked, hella burnt, throwed in the head, fried
Look, hella turnt, turnin’ donuts in my ride
Leaving skid marks with my tires, making bowties
Infinity signs, figure-8s, running through stop signs
I’m never on time, I’m always late, 24-hour grind
I’m a different kind, won’t hesitate to bust you with my nine
BIATCH!

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Don’t drink and drive, crashin’ whips
DUIs, get your ass kicked
You think you hot, driving fast as shit?
It was suicide when you smashed it
I got a bad bitch, we hella drunk
She cute as fuck with a big ol’ dunk
I told her that’s what I want
So we left the party on one (On one)
We in the parking lot, having sex
Me and this sexy bitch
Fuckin’ in the car, we both extra lit
In the backseat, look like we wrestlin’
I’m too drunk to drive, might crash the car
So I’mma keep fuckin’ this nasty broad
It ain’t over ‘til I’m sober
Had to start the bitch up, then I drove her

Last night I tried…but I couldn’t drive
‘Cause I was toasted (TOASTED!)
I’m toasted (TOASTED!)
Last night I tried…but I couldn’t drive
‘Cause I was toasted (TOASTED!)

(E-40: Fuck wit’ us or don’t fuck wit’ us at all, mayne
You fuckin’ around, look…)

[Verse 3: E-40]
Now, I glow like neon, but I don’t drive a Neon
I’m cold like Freon, but I’m far from a peon
Them Bay boys (What about ‘em?) They some patients
Experts in psychological manipulation
He square as a piece of tile
I’m gamed up, do your homework, check my G file
He an algae, he a fungus, he a mold
I’m a boss, put the president on hold
Niggas don’t want you around ‘em like poison ivy
You play too much, take life too lightly
I stay tough, rebound if I must
Mini AK bust, finger on the clutch, in the clutch (BLAOW!)
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, threw some T-shirts with airbrush
Flowers and caskets, that’s enough
It’s sick out here, times is tough
Don’t bother while I’m loaded, get my money posted
Blowing my buzz when I’m drinking, getting toasted
BIATCH!
