[Verse 1:]
Ugh yea
40 in this motherfucker
Mobbed out with this shit man
They don’t make em like this no more
Let him show up, let him show out, let him cut up
Without a doubt

[Verse 1:]
Fresh back from vacation right back into the thick of things
It’s a win win situation paper plottin my money scheme
I got clients out there waitin dirty white girl heroin and lean
Ain't no time for flakin got a little bit of everything
Pull up in the lotus and make the devious hella envious
Nope i’m smarter than the average bear rather slide through in a prius
50 miles to the gallon incognito not too noticeable. Dont want to stick out like a zit i’m not a role model or a mogul
Even tho i be hella helpin shit even buying toys for kids at christmas
But they media ain't goin speak on this ghetto celebrity now that you back in the house
The ghetto and the suburbs where the rich folks and the poor folks live
Kick back watch and observe the way the ogs moved and the things they did
Mob shit they don’t make music like this no more all i fuck with is sickwidit
Slapping e40 on pandora he be cutting up, he be smacking
I know i’m not from the bay from the midwest but i can understand every word he be sayin

[Chorus:]
Yea everybody know you
My cousin just called me from the pen
He said you heard that new 40 shit that nigga shit slapped
Front to back he on the case man help me get through my little case man [x2]

[Verse 2:]
This bitch artist a bitch manage music, operations
Nigga get rich makin enemies wanna switch or jump ship
If you can’t beat em then join em hop in the mix
It’s enough money for all of us to get
Now I ain't didn’t sayin no clown shit partna this is the bay
This may or may not be a good place to have kids
That’s what they like to play with the ks
Get on your marks ready set go tic-tac toe or tag 3 in a row
I got partnas on death row facing lethal injection
If they had a second chance they would probably come around
Jesus died for our sins repent and  you get into heaven
That’s what i telling them when they be call me collect, in they thoughts
Right now i’m drunk in public off that secret sauce
Pissin on the side on the building fuck the club on they feelings
What if they popo see that shit then i’m a sober up hella quick
Cause i’m on my second strike and all i got left is one more pitch

[Chorus ]

[Verse 3:]
All money ain't good money
Cause you goun end up spending more money
And the less money you spend the less on the back end
That’s why a scared man always lose and a brave man always win
If you plan on getting ready invest your dividend
Buy a pawn shop, a strip bar, commercial parking lot
A liquor store, a studio but don’t spend everything you got
Do as i do not as i say put some up for a rainy day
When it’s dry sit on your yeah hibernate till the month of may
Dang it let the value rise like yeast when you slangin
Bitch you fuck around you get any price you want just name it
Gotta know the storm chaser, the weather man or lay day
My essay, my amigo, my compadre
Be shy, get a job camouflage stay under the radar that’s how beat the odds
Using your own products i don’t condone that or approve it
But that’s your business as long as you handlin your business you can do that

[Chorus]
