[Hook: Nicamari]
Waiting on a play, I need some motion
Shorty super wet, she like an ocean
Glance out the window when I’m coasting
Get respect from Dubai to Oakland
See I’m about my paper, real hustler
Never worry about a hater or a busta
I play the game how it’s made to be played
I ring bells from the Bay to the U.K

[Verse 1: E-40]
Waitin’ on a play, I need some motion
Got the joog on the pills and I ain’t talking Motrin
Tough skin like an alligator
Fuck a hater, doing numbers on my calculator
Smoking leprechaun flowers
Getting higher than a cell tower
Pushing a hard line
Bosses drink wine
Wrist on froze when it’s sunny
Whole team seeing money
Always keep it solid, never acting funny
Give it to you if I got it, you my homie
Raised on the tarmac
Predominately Black habitat
Might wanna pack a gat
Fuck around and get your shit pushed back

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I’m all about my paper, real hustler
Single parent, mama didn’t raise a sucka
Bank now but it used be small
Broken towel racks and toilet tissue holders hanging off the wall
A loaf of bread, a stick of butter and some milk
Concrete the way me and brother and them was built
Eager and ambitious, hoe
For real street niggas though (UH!)
Ave animal
If it ain’t about money, it ain’t tangible
If you ain’t talking dollars, you can’t holla
I don’t owe a fucka shit, I’m not your father
I started with a half a zip
Worked my way up to a whole kick
A kick mean a brick, a brick mean a block
Throw it in the pot
