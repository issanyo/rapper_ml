"Here's a little story I got to tell"
"And this list goes on, again and again"
Uh, Uh

[Verse 1]
I think it goes, ya live by the dirt, ya die by the shovel
You can repent and come with God or you can go with devil
You can go and get a job or you can do some federal
But if I were you, I'd straighten up and do some next level
Huh, I often tweak when I drives
How can a small town like Vallejo have all these homicides?
Man, fools be droppin' like flies
Maybe we need more brothers selling bean pies
And it's a fool 'cause everybody mama's know each other
It ain't cool, but you know black folks like to act they color
Wonder why all the good people get put through
So many different changes of the weather
And all those folks that do wrong seem like they live forever
I wish I can rewind time
Remember when we used to get free lunch, and the city bus used to cost a dime
Runnin around, talkin' about you got the cooties
Liftin up skirts, and touchin' girl's booties
Boy, take those shoes off before ya come up in this house
And whatever you do, don't you sit on grandmama's plastic covered couch
Why is it that when all the homies get together, we go back in the days
And how come every time we get drunk somebody bring up AIDS?
Life is something you can't borrow and give back
Here today and gone tomorrow, just like that
Pat your ass on your back
Take some time out yo waltz
Tell your loved ones that you love them every so often

"Here's a little story I got to tell"
"And this list goes on, again and again"

[Verse 2]
Uh, fetty is the key to the end of all your worries
Contemporary crib, cash, cars and clothes
But fetty 'cause problems like guns and spears
Families fall out and don't talk for years
Like my cromey (Like my cromey)
They called him Big Bread Ed
His first cousin set him up and left his ass for dead
Churches, wakes, nothing unusual
Seem like every other damn day I'm buying a brand new suit for a funeral
Have your pockets ever lost weight, and you ain't even tried?
Did you wonder if your cash was on a diet?
See, when you're up, everybody wanna come around
But when you're down, ain't nobody out there to be found
If you love someone you should tell 'em often
Ya never know when they'll be layin' in a coffin
Dedicated to my weeples up in jail
Ya partner 40 Water gotta story to tell (a story to tell)

[Hook 4x]
"Here's a little story I got to tell"
"And this list goes on, again and again"

[Verse 3]
They can take the ninja out the ghetto (the ghetto)
But not the ghetto out the ninja
Give me life for three rocks, but I won't surrender
Oh, he's a heathen (heathen), look at the way he dress
He must be dealin (dealin), how did he get that Lex?
Of course, if it ain't used get spokes, it's crime and coast
That's all they worth
Shootin' shit up and actin tough, ridin' around with gold and stuff
It's roughâ€”How much money you earn?
Enough, I own my own law firm
Don't need a tux, I twerks pea coats and khakis (khakis)
Levi's and T-shirts (Levi's and t-shirts)
Whatever the street's works (street's works)
Partner deuce, you been actin' kinda funny lately since you done got a few bucks
But I'm still folks, Wilson Park, remember three flies up
And this goes on, again and again
This goes on, again and again
Ain't nothin' changed but the territory
Same time, different day, different story
