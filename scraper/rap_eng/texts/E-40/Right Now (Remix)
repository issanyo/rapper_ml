[Chorus: Ziggy]
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now

[Verse 1: E-40]
You in the presence of a reputable, lower your tone
I'm always right, even when I'm wrong
There's money on the table, let's talk, I'm all ears
If it ain't about money then kick cans and beers
You niggas ain't hustlin forwards, you hustlin' backwards
You niggas ain't eatin', you starvin, cheese and crackers
I been a factor, like Ben Baller, 'bout my business
Before rapper I pushed weight like Planet Fitness
Ought to be in the Guinness, for thirty years been makin' slaps
Recording Industry Association of America, RIAA certification plaques
The path that I chose to take was quite intelligent
Street nigga turned rapper, still relevant, bitch

[Chorus: Ziggy]
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now

[Verse 2: Philthy Rich]
I know my ex bitch mad, made the ho pack her bags
She a xanny head and poppin' tags and fryin' facts
Faygo cotton candy, drop a deuce in the twenty ounce
Foreign paint candy, on the weekend probably bring it out
Thick redbone like my ex bitch Letty
Two hundred thou in cash, your baby daddy money petty
I'm the wrong nigga at the show to try to push up on
Beat a nigga ass in the crowd if he lookin' wrong
F&N stuffed in the pesos hoodie
Spending ten dollars on a 5X hoodie
Me a Lil Tommie count a hundred thou, all new
Big face benjis, hundred dollar bills, all blue

[Chorus: Ziggy]
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now

[Verse 3: Too $hort]
Right now, I got a pocket full of money
I don't need nothin' from a bitch
I ain't ever ask her for shit, it's her choice
She give me everything she get
I don't give a fuck about shit
When I drop my top she gon' suck my dick
While I'm ridin' ain't nothin' to contradict
I don't never pay hoes, I don't never trick
I'm a hustler, that's how I live like this
I can hit a lick and then spend it quick
I take a flick and then fuck your chick
I make her empty her purse and got equip from her jits
Bitch, put the money on the table

[Chorus: Ziggy]
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Money on the table, I ain't tryna play with you
What you got for a player right now?
Got her hands on me, got bands on me
Got bands on me right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now, right now
