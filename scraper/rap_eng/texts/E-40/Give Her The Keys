[Intro]
Yeah Mane!
Its magic!
E-40 and amp; my partna T-pain
(nappy boy!)

[Chorus]
Open up that garage
Its a big fat car
With a big fat bow on top (on top)
Its a Bentley Coupe with the roof let back
Now shawty you know that's hot
Ima give her the keys oh
And Ima give her the keys oh
Now shawty sang it to me oh
And Ima give her the keys oh
Ooo

[Verse 1]
From a bucket to a Benz
A Benz to a Bentley
Down with me from the start
Got my back like a tank top
When I used to be on the block
She hide my rocks in her yacht
Got a special place in my heart she know how to play
Her part
Everytime I look at you darling
I get a hard on
You sexy without your makeup on
I wanna bone
Move you out the hood
I told you I would
I’m not phony
We both from the same place
Grew up on fried bologna
They say the opposites attract
But we gotta a lot in common
Behind every boss player a boss woman
Imam fiend when it comes to your cooking
You do your thing
Throw down like Paula Deen
Neck bones and collard greens

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Born in the mud, raised in the trap
Down ass broad, never been a sap
If I ever needed bail, went to jail got popped
You’ll be Johnny on the spot you’ll come and get me out
A loyalist, not just a friend to me
We was meant to be
We got chemistry
You like it when I lay this pipe
Been around each other so long
They say we starting to look alike
Starting to think alike
Getting our money right
Fuss, fight then make love all night
California king on a California queen
My California dream we make a good team

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Its the little things that count any means much
Can't nothing come between us can't nothing separate us
You’re my backbone
You my rib
You my chick
You my backbone
You my rib
You my chick
Its the little things that count
Any means much
Can’t nothing come between us can't nothing separate us
You my backbone
You my rib
You my chick
You my backbone
You my rib
You my chick

[Bridge]
Yea mane!
Its a drought on loyal females mane
The good ones is hard to find mane
So when you find a good one
Hold on to that broad
Mane you hear me

[Chorus]
