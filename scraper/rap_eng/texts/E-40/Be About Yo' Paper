(We havin' so much fetti, homes, we can't quit now)

[Verse 1: B-Legit]
I break the back off a cake
Mix some soda with this A-1 D
I ziplock and flip flop, 43
I'm livin' like a kingpin 'cause I had clients
Them bitches love to fuck with us Hillside giants
And I was hittin' me one, no matter the cost
A 4-4-2 with the dual exhaust
With so much rumble in the back of my load
I hit the parking lot and watch convertibles fold
Them zippers was sold, them bitches use to hold my D
And back then an ounce would cost you a G
I stacked 22 and had 21 left
7 to the kill, nigga, thanks to my chef
They was lovin' me to death 'cause I had cream
Them niggas double up so dope fiend never seen
And on my team you, gon' get your green
'Cause a nigga had to have it by all means

[Chorus 2X: Levitti]
Be about yo' paper, mayne
Fetti, scrilla, scratch, mayne
Be about yo' paper, mayne
Fetti, scratch, mayne

[Verse 2: D-Shot]
My paper, my paper is way too strong
'Cause when it comes to fetti, muthafucka, it's on
Money, scratch, revenues and all that shit
Stingy nigga in your hood tryin' to strike at rich
I gots the town hecks a sewed up
Thangs for 13-5, no bakin' soda
I'm to heavy the feds can't fuck with me
My lawyers paid so fuck the D.E.A
Boss ballin droppin sacks through your fuckin hood
You want it hard or soft, It's to the good
We're gettin stronger with this distribution drug shit
We're gettin bigger muthafuckas don't want to see my Click
I'm in and out, from town to fuckin' town
Collectin' mail, makin' my fuckin' rounds
Northern Cali is the place where a nigga dwells
Nuts hangin', bitch, I'm about my mail

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: E-40]
Sittin' on top of a mattress full of dried up pee stains
Choppin up my candy cane
Use your razor blade, nigga, use a safety pin
See, I probably wouldn't quit if they raided my shit
Soon as I get out I'm rit back in it
Now I got my own car and we're thick as shit
Oh, you ain't know? A car's a click
Employees on the boulevard rough and tough'n
Got my test clean from puff and stuff'n
Came off a hook up on some chops never been fired off
Steal a box with the styrofoam, guaranteed not to cough
Vallejo, V-Town, Valley Joe
No respect for the muthafuckin' po-po
A Yabba Doo, the boys in blue be gettin' shook'n
Sometimes I'm suited up, sometimes I'm bummy lookin'
Slick and sly, whoppin 'em at they own game
Publicity stunts changing my pager number every three months

[Chorus]
