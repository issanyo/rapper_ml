Zap board beneath the ashtray, woofers in the back
Water in the duals make loud glass pack
Gold tippy toes without a lick of chrome
Bought a set of Vogues and left the, stickers on
Seven grand worth of bump for the trunks
Paid cash, all ones
Some old bitch came up to me and said, "What's the latest, bro?"
I said, "I'm tryin to have more chips than Las Vegas, ho"
She said, "Can I roll with you? I get the dicks hard"
I said, "You gon' work the strip, Sonoma Boulevard"
"How much would I make?" I said, "Mega
Just bring me back my scrilla scratch paper"
Heart (heart) money (money) street (street) hustle
Sex, drugs, smuggle, bubble
Horns, yellin, speakers, subbin
Sound just like the inside of a club, and...
How many times could a Conrad come so buttery?
Always on to' back, have people lovin me
Alcoholic drunk that ain't no gimmick, B
I'm always in and out the Betty Ford clinic, see
Drug paraphernalia cream butterscotch
Illegal like a garbage of hubba rocks
Workin off my pager, you know the ropes
I'm makin that cabbage cornbread like Oprah
Diamond satch-uels from ja-fuckin-home
Pose just like a pimp smokin a honey blunt
In a Major Way I tried to told ya
Niggas had my shit fucked back in the days but now they know'a
Sold a bunch of units underground
They was bumpin Save a Hoe in every town
Rumor has it that I died, I got smoked, mayne
But I'm alive, they was talkin about somebody else, mayne

*chorus*
We say dem niggas P.H
But dey really ain't knowin, dey ain't no
Me rather stack more papes
And steady get to bubblin, yeah fa sho'

Revenues, on my mind
I can't hold back, now's the time
Bust a dope addict crack fiend in the jaw
Fool had his spook on, tried to steal my car
Da Bay, where hoes be janky, sheist
And niggas, do so much dirt we got lice
Prices, go up and down like a teeter-totter
Filthy shit, ring around the collar
Just the other day I heard a Bootsy nigga shout
"Man that nigga don't be doin all that damn shit he talk about"
Fools think they know me think they got me figured out
But NIGGA... NIGGA!?!?
I plays this shit for bread and meat
So nigga if you feel froggish leap
I don't smoke dog food, sherm, loop or snow
But I leave a trail of bidis everywhere I go
So tell a friend like Alpha Beta
I'm gonna get it like T.C. the money maker
I know you're with it
Mayday mayday, unexplained object coming your way
Breaker breaker it's E-40 bitches call me the ahh
Ballin ass, tycoon talkin big wheeler
Money hungry, penny pinchin stingy nigga
On the sc-rilla, always on the go, get a
Super bad and we can split her

*chorus*

Me have no time for de bullshiters (4X)
