Swishers, phillies, backwards, stuffin em wid dis OG kush, pinchin outta ma bundle, trees is what dis OG kush
All d youngsters call me uncle, I’ll put money on they books, when they get busted by the popo (bitch!)

Bricks got sparkle, Montana white
Break a barrel sack about to get em off tonight
Ma gangstaz on d bike, milli in d bushes, Minnesota nickles on d line fo’ d kushes
I tell em no questions, we closer to d edge, an we be takin heads fo’ d bread (yea)

[Chorus]
