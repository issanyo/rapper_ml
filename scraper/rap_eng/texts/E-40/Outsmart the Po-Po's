[Verse 1: E-40]
It's 9 a.m. (fuck), time for a poisoned one
Light the incense, sit on the toilet some
The Rossi got me smellin' like I'm dead inside
I'm stankin' up the bathroom with nothin' to hide
Gotta go, flush the commode, k
Threw on the same damn clothes I wore yesterday
Me got some niggas come down from outta town see
They want to meet me halfway at the Nut Tree
But I'm starvin' so I'm chargin'
15-5 for the margarine
A-1 Yola tightly packed
17-5 for the  Gucci rack
Strike to the spot ridin' wit' a
My nine millimeter Beretta
The broad that be holdin' my D, she loves me
Long as I keep dickin' her down properly
Sittin' low in my Cut not like a failure
In front of baby's house straight talkin' on a cellular
Bring me out a unit, a birdie, a cake
With the gypsyness before it's too late
Penitentiary time drastic
Here she come with a kilo in a baby basket
Gotta play your cards right, game tight
Can't be slippin' in the 90's, damn right

[Chorus: E-40]
Outsmart the Po-Po's
Known to the marks as the don't knows
You gotta outsmart the Po-Po's
You know, you gotta do that shit though, be woke to that though
Outsmart the Po-Po's
Muthafuckas always fuckin' with us
You gotta outsmart the Po-Po's
They love fuckin' with us niggaros
You gotta outsmart the Po Po's
Check it out

[Verse 2: E-40]
I wear street clothes, pants be saggin'
I'm not bootsee and I don't drive a dope wagon
Got a grip and I don't be braggin'
Can't be laggin', gotta keep stackin' (yeah)
I keeps me a strap in case'a, I gotta shoot a simp in his face'a
It's better to be caught with than without
Jealous muthafuckas would love it if they heard that I was tooken out
Zeniths in the summertime, Rallys in the winter (yeah)
Ridin' with a light skinned big booty tender
Harass them muthafuckas on gold shoes
Tryin' to put a stop on my revenues
The Po-Po's I dislike 'em (hate 'em)
Crooked ass cops will make you fight 'em
But you know that I know the Po-Po's would love for
A nigga to even attempt to act black
That's why you gotta

[Chorus: E-40]
Outsmart the Po-Po's
Yeah, muthafuckas gotta do that though
Outsmart the Po-Po's
All they want you to do is to get aggressive, you know what I'm saying
Outsmart the Po-Po's
Yeah, I got my partna Legitimate B on the other side of me, yeah
He finna let you do about this little story that went down with him
Outsmart the Po-Po's
Yeah, check this part out though, spit that shit, B

[Verse 3: B-Legit + (E-40)]
It's Saturday night and to the nightclub (yeah)
I got Tanqueray, juice, and the green bud (and the green bud)
Tacked on the freeway doin' fifty y'all (50 y'all)
A brand new thang lookin nifty y'all (nifty y'all)
I open the juice and then I take some swallows (yeah)
And add the muthafuckin' gin to the same bottle (that's right)
Roll me a Swisher, put the ounce in the back (then what?)
I keep it the trunk right next to the gat (what they do though?)
Po-Po's jack but can't fuck with me (what you got?)
An open juice bottle and a little ol' doobie (what they got to kiss?)
Cops better kiss my ass 'fore a nigga like Legitimate blasts

[Chorus: E-40]
Outsmart the Po-Po's
You know, that's what a muthafucka gotta do
Outsmart the Po-Po's
All they wanna do is ice you, they'd love to put a nigga on ice, you know
Outsmart the Po-Po's
They're known to the marks as the don't knows, you gotta
Outsmart the Po-Po's
Fuck the Five-O's, the po-po's and the metro, I'm on a, you know

[Outro: E-40]
Hey, outsmart them muthafuckas, you know what I'm saying
