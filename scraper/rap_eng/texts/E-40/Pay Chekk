[E-40]
She a flirt, she look like pet milk come out when she squirt
She don’t believe in wearing panties under her skirt
No bra under her shirt

I like the way she twerk, I like the way she twerk
I like the way, I like the way, I like the way she twerk
I like the way she twerk, I like the way she twerk
She don’t believe in wearing panties under her skirt

Baby this your motivation
Make your cheeks applaud like a standing ovation
Got my dick hard like incarceration
Let me buy you a drink, intostication, hello, uuaah
Ain't nothing square about this hustler here man
Give a chick a Chinese name
One gone, Play head games
But you want more, want more
Get it real within your rear
It's smacking yo mind, baby girl they call me Earl
I rap and I rhyme but I used to sell that swirl
That white, white, white candy cane and Mother of Pearl
It's right, right, right bitch

[Chorus]
I said hey lil' momma, what’s the deal?
Talk to me girl, I'ma keep it real
I’ve been on you since you walked through the door
Now drop it low like there's money on the floor

[Spark Master Tape]
Fuck Robin Hood, we robbin' hoods
We move in silence, killers should
We bang hard, we been high, no change man
Fuck a job man, my CV say I gang bang

Push a foreign whip, I fuck a foreign bitch
Got a foreign couch, bitch I own a foreign house
Pull a foreign clip, I got a foreign clique
Got ya girl at the crib, she eat a foreign dick

Pussy like a buffet, laid out like a duvet
Ox' poppin' bunny, wanna fuck and film a movie
She still clappin' that ass, ass, ass, ass, make bands with it
Deep throat no hands wit it
Spark beef, you gamblin
She been peepin' the steez, bent down on knees
Taught the bitch to go deep, it's that money shot ho, cheese

All it
All it take is a turbo for me to steal a Porsche
I'm in the kitchen and that shit look like a ski resort

I like the way she twerk, I like the way she twerk
I like the way, I like the way, I like the way she twerk
I like the way she twerk, I like the way she twerk
She don’t believe in wearing panties under her skirt

[Chorus]
I said hey lil' momma, what’s the deal?
Talk to me girl, I'ma keep it real
I’ve been on you since you walked through the door
Now drop it low like there's money on the floor

[Dat Nigga Nug]
Bitch drop that ass down to the pavement
Like you shaking it for Satan
Make money, make money, money uhhh!
Tell your homegirl with the big 'ol butt
Stop fronting, get the pussy up ho
It's just me and the Spark Master
Dropping out of spaceballs out of NASA
Coming through fresher than your pastor
I mean cooler than Alaska (ya like it?)

Chevy sittin' way high up off the ground
Blowing on piff I ain't coming down
I used to move mids like the Migos
And then I got bricks bitch I'm ?Nebo?
Rolling up on shorty like, Wassup on my 40 I
Got a couple dollars, I heard bands'l make her dance, bitch
Bring a couple friends and, get some of this bread cause it's
Paper Platoon, we the goons and we in

I like the way she twerk, I like the way she twerk
I like the way, I like the way, I like the way she twerk
I like the way she twerk, I like the way she twerk
She don’t believe in wearing panties under her skirt

[Chorus]
I said hey lil' momma, what’s the deal?
Talk to me girl, I'ma keep it real
I’ve been on you since you walked through the door
Now drop it low like there's money on the floor

[Sample: Oprah Winfrey & Michael Jackson]
Why do you always grab your crotch? (giggle)

Hey lil' momma, what’s the deal?

[Spark Master Tape] x2
Paper Platoon, we blow loud
In the club shit about to go down
Paper goons, we rollin' out
In the car blow they fucking brain out

I like the way she twerk, I like the way she twerk
I like the way, I like the way, I like the way she twerk
I like the way she twerk, I like the way she twerk
She don’t believe in wearing panties under her skirt

Now I ain't never been a pussy motherfucker shit is simple
Smile in the ocean, catch a bullet to ya dimples
And two two your temple

Force is instrumental, fuck a partner in crime my whole gang down to die for mine
