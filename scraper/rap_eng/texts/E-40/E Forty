[Intro: 2Pac]
Because I can't always be in the Bay
And I know how the Bay is the Bay is the side people man if you ain't there they goin talk about'cha
So I want them to know, I love you I feel you I'm representing for you
So I know I gotta certain amount of acclaim and everything so I bring the Bay with me
I know E-40 is what I was when I was with digital underground
He is the Bay right now...

E-For-Ty
E-For-Ty
E-For-Ty
E-For...

[Hook]
E-For-Ty (what's my name?)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Ugh! Back like I never left
Fake niggas hate me, real niggas love me to death
I used to be broke when I was a child
Now I'm papered up, I'm what they call a cash cow
Y'all grew up on this thow
I'm the 'with that was' and the 'with that is' right now
(What else pimp?) I fucks with everybody that somebody
The not-there-yets, the little people and the nobodies
Longevity, got it tatted on my arm
I am to rap what Ron Jeremy is to porn
Unique people love the way I speak
"That nigga 40 a fool, he be having me weak"
The voice of the soil, face of the Bay
Say what the people wanna say but ain't got the outlet to say
So they count on me to relay the way they feel
You see the realest rapper alive
You niggas live through me
BIATCH!

[Verse 2: E-40]
Ugh! Gas no surpass now, I'm outlasting 'em
Name your favorite rapper, he's no match for him
Nigga disrespect, I'll bring his hat to 'em
Spend a little change, have his friend shoe 'em
Workaholic, more hungrier than you dudes
One thing about me is I bust moves
I stay coming with slaps
Every time I drop an album people expect [?]
All the way through, front and back
After all these years that nigga can still rap
Earthquaking, heavy rotation
2 AM in the morning after the club at the gas station
All you hear is my mackin' ass
And I'm jocking the crack drive-thru, getting they food fast
I complement the wolves
The pimps, players and the pushers

[Verse 3: E-40]
Out with the old and in with the new
Or should I say in with the old and out with the new?
Whooping ass with this tongue fool
You got mo' sales than me but I got more respect than you
I'm from the gang cooking burgers in the kitchen
Used to get off weight like Nutrisystem
A lot of my [?] locked up in prison
Free Mack West and Katie Stuntz, missing
Ugh! Always on the move?
I stick to the script plus strictly by the old school rules
Might not work construction but I tote tools
Hammers and staples I'll knock you out your shoes
My life ain't never been no peach cobbler
What is the Bay without Water?
When there's a drought I'm sorta like a force of nature
I used to sprinkle 'em but now I make it shower
