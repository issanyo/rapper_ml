[Chorus 1: Hurricane Chris]

[Verse 1: The Game]
You can find me in tha a bay bay
Buckin full of cry-stale V.I.Ped up
Goin hard in body tap where they throw that cheese up
I been about my paper niggas know about my stack
You don't like that dirty money send yo girl to wipe me down
Million dollars on my neck and wrist shine for a mile
She wanna see it up close then she gotta walk it out
I'm tha king of this rap shit, fuck they talkin' bout
Niggas can't sell records so they blame it on tha South
I be all through Shreve-port Louisiana ballin'
Like who the fuck said ain't no choppers in New Orleans
My rims so clean they spinnin' like a world-wind
Pull up at the club bitches textin' they girlfriends
They know who I is they know who I am
I be flyin' through the south in that burgundy land
Pull up at the light my shitt so bright
She want my number call me tonight
Pick up the phone like

[Chorus 2: Hurricane Chris]
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay
I'm in the club hollerin'
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay

Just like the Lava House click
"Pass me some wata"
Outta my mind outta my body thumper never loose
Rollin' you can sip that Donald Duck orange juice
Mean muggs fix your face upside down smile
Money call the fete chase been doin' it for a while
Phunk Dog on the beat with it jig with it
Hustlers play for keep with it so I keep my heat with it

[Verse 6: Hurricane Chris]
Well its the H to tha U double R I C-A-N to tha E get em up, get em up, get em up like
A bay bay that's what we say when we pull up in them trucks
Tell my label to cut the check I'm a gone spend it up
On the Bentley painted yellow like a baby school bus
26's make em stop when I pull up
And my pants sag low like I was rockin' a pull-up
When I stop and I pull up I'm a be already full of Vodka
I keep that in my cup a bay bay on make me bussa
And if you try to take my chain I'm a snatch yo face off
I got diamonds in my ear the same size as baseballs
Where they at they lost I don't thank they on my level
Lil Mama thank I'm a bite her with this alligator sweater
A bay bay was just the beginning I'm finna run tha game
Whoever feel different can holla at Hurricane
Wanna be talkin' but heavy itenary break up yo chest if you runnin' yo mouth
And every since I dropped that a bay bay I been runnin' the South

[Chorus 1: Hurricane Chris]
I'm in the club hollerin'
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay

[Verse 7: Jadakiss]
Yo look at any game 50 large is what I came with
25 for bottles 25 to make it rain with
This ain't Reggie Miller, ma this is kush and haze mixed
Don't sit there and lie to me you ain't never taste this
Hope the Lord forgive me gave my Jesus piece a facelift
Stones is doin' the watusi in the bracelet
Ain't no stopping that I be where the gwap is at
Excuse me I be wherever its poppin' at
Now I'm on the dance floor iced out lights out
Wifebeater true religion shorts and my Nikes out
Drinkin' out the bottle talking much shit dutch lit
Every bunny with an arms reach wanna touch kiss
Back to the couch with a section full of honey dips
Black on 26's we fresh
Yes and when I leave they all following just cuz I was in the club hollerin'

[Chorus 2: Hurricane Chris]
A bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay, a bay bay
I'm in the club hollerin'
