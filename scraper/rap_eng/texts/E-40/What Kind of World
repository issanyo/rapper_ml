[Verse 1:]
Do we think we’ll ever be able to go back to havin fair
Once from the shoulder fist and plams
Instead shootin each other in the jaw
Now that they change the gun laws
I doubt it that’s like they askin these rappers
To stop braggin about they jewellery and money
It ain't gonna happen
Family can say anything to you like your feelings don’t work
But if you say something to them they get all but hurt
We living in a different time lucifer’s busy but he can’t win
Cause i got faith in god and the blood jesus over my skin
How comes everytime i turn on the news
The news refuse to show anything positive just only the negative
And the people i respect the most been lettin me down
Used to be solid as the ground now they be on this clown shit
Too old for this shit they not a leader they record conversations
And put ya on the loudspeaker and try to get you to murder mouth a dude
By talkin down on a dude so you can feel that it’s cool but it’s a set up
And suckas do anything for some tail
Try to turn a hoe into a house life that’s why 53.1 % of all marriages fail
And as far a road rage, you gotta be careful what you do
Cause you neva know what the next person is goin through

[Chorus:]
What kind of world are we living in
Jealousy and deceptions
Life lessons be so treacherous
I pray that god keeps on blessing us
What kind of world are we living in
Poverty and corruption
Blood stains is the evidence
I think i’ll write a letter to my president

[Verse 2:]
He used to be a hitter
Backwards ass smile then he slowed his ass down
Cause he had his first child
Started goin to church a whole new environment
Till his bro bro got hit brought him out of retirement
You ain't gotta look for trouble cause trouble will find you
Even if you seasoned like barbecue or bar gumbo roux
These youngsters will try you and try to test your patience
But it take patience to catch a patient
Caught him slippy, slippy lean in the chevy box
Unloaded the magazine in his dreadlocks
Da da  dah that’s how that stick sounds
Da da dah feel somethang round
They wasn’t fuckin round knocked a nigga down
Left his brains in his lap and his sprite on the ground
Neva know who you really in business with, who ya nigga
Cause a hit could be cause a some paper or a favor

[Chorus]
What kind of world are we living in
Jealousy and deceptions
Life lessons be so treacherous
I pray that god keeps on blessing us
What kind of world are we living in
Poverty and corruption
Blood stains is the evidence
I think i’ll write a letter to my president [x2]
