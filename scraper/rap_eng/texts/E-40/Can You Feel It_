“Can you feel it?”

[Verse 1: E-40]
I got a plastic medicine container of that Afghani—peep
Brought rolling papers, no chemicals, no bleach
I’m about to be in there, to the point where I’mma blur my speech
After I finish this liter of yak and blow this eighth of kief
Mannish, don’t bother me, I’ll pop ya
With these 5-point-5-6’s, bust your medulla oblongata
That’ll stop ya, bring you up real proper
Spin you around like the propellers on a hiznelicopter
My name ain’t Harry, but I’m a Potter
My mouth hella dry, I need some water
One day I know I’mma die, forgive me Father
But I’m living for now, forget tomorrow
I’m a product of my environment, so I ain’t thinking about retirement
I’mma continue to push this yay, fuck a 401(K)
I fuck on squaws every day, and I get my helmet ate'n
Parole violator, my agent hella be hatin’

“Can you feel it?”

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
I’m high as gasoline off promethazine
And my whole team, we lean in them Cut’ Supremes
I keep a couple things, plus a mask or two
A 40 Glock with a dot in case I have to
I might blast through, chop it up and bounce
My little homie, he be on me, say I owe an ounce
I tell him ‘Catch me in the morning with your bank account
And I’ll just take it off the tab when you cash me out’
I do the mass amount of numbers, I’m impeccable
And I ain’t even gon’ lie, I’m off them edibles
You see, my niggas come through, they buy them vegetables
And out-of-town muthafuckas need their medical
I put the work in, I get them dividends
And them Benjamins become a nigga’s best friend
And everything I’m in, you know it’s off the hinge
It feel good when a real nigga win—say it den

[Verse 3: E-40 + B-Legit]
“Go on and get your fuck on”—that’s what I told her
I don’t want her triflin’ ass no more, y’all can have my leftovers
I ain’t finna be head over heels over no broad, mayne, I’m too fly
I bait my hook up for another fish to fry
See, when a dude fuck hella broads, he’s a player
But when a broad fuck hella dudes, she’s a slut
And you wanna know what else—you wanna know what? (What?)
I find out that she was fuckin’ on one of the homies, I’m fuckin’ ’em both up
I tell bitches where I’m from to leave their feelings at home
And if they’re listening, they probably ain’t feeling this song
But am I wrong? Standing there looking at me crazy
I’m never fuckin’ you when these other bitches pay me
Already with the baby, come on with them dollars
I’ll show you where they’re going, then them other hoes’ll follow
I’m off in my Impala, 9-fin exact
I just revamped that, put them 10’s in the back
