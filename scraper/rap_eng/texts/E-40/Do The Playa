[Verse 1: E-40]
Right up my ally, my nigga, this killer Cali, my nigga
I'm from the valley, my nigga, we hella rowdy, my nigga
You have a problem, my nigga, man we gon' solve it, my nigga
Yeah we got it, my nigga, case like the Saudis, my nigga
Let a boss through, so a boss can do what a boss do
I don't Winnie the Pooh, Willie Foo Foo, or Captain Kangaroo
I'm one of the few that say what I'm gonna do and come through
I'm a throwback but at the same time I'm brand new
I can multitask, do two or three things at once
Get my dick sucked, hit the weed, talk on the phone, and get drunk
If you family we family, then say it, mean it
Never let sucker shit come in between us
I'm still mobbing, scheming, and plotting on some millions
Trying to put some paint where it ain't, Sherwin Williams
Right now I'm on this lambi and dank, fuck your feelings
I don't hang with phoneys or fakes, only real ones

[Hook: Decadez]
D-boy fresh from head to toe
Finna take some down before I go home
Drink my drink and smoke my 'dro
I bet that I pull all these hoes
Now do the playa
Nuvo sippin and two-steppin
Do the playa
West coast reppin with my weapon

[Verse 2: E-40]
This hustler cold, always in monster mode
The game can be sold and told at the same time
Never goin against the grain
I'm on the front line and the main line
Of this West Coast scene I grind
And I never drop a dime for reduced time
I'm a staple in this shit, a pillar in this shit
Don't believe me? Nigga, ask your bitch
Just now getting warmed up, just now getting started
Triple O.G., still getting carded
Bump any batch, ho, I'm a mack
Ain't no age on game, bitch, whack don't crack
People always ask me why I'm seldom seen
Is he still green, do he still fuck with the fiends?
Nope, I'm clean, in the rap game there's more green
I'm eating just like a king, got my hands in everything
From gritting and pitching raw, hubba rocks in my jaw
Platinums on the wall, ball 'til we fall

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Damn, look at that mayne, she ain't playing, she handling
Let me put my macking in motion and put the peas in the pie
She cakey, she yokin, she got a big ass butt
I'm a Bay area nigga, my nigga, I be wigglin'
I could go to any hood in the world and fit right in
Hit it for five, hold it for ten
Smoking and sipping yac
Internationally known, accepted, and highly respected
There's a shortage on real ones we better start getting in sync
Before the suckers take over and we become extinct
Shout out to all the bosses before me I'd like to thank
Street legends with love and respect like Hamp "Bubba" Banks
All my fixtures and factors, factors and fixtures
Car passin travelers, Louis the XIII sippers
O.G's need youngsters and youngsters need O.G's
Never let a ho make us enemies

[Hook]
