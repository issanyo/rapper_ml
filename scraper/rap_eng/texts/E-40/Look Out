[Chorus: Too $hort + E-40]
You gotta look out
For your mama, your sister, and the kids
You know it ain’t safe where they live
You gotta look out
For little cutie on the block with the braids
She bound to end up on the blade (On the blade?)
You gotta look out
For little homie that just did ten
So he never go back to the pen
You gotta look out
Little homie got a lot of potential
But he can’t stop living by the pistol
You gotta look out

[Verse 1: E-40]
Whatever happened to the words “You’re welcome”?
People not only want you to help ‘em
They want you think of a way to help ‘em (Help ‘em)
Damned if I do, damned if I don’t (Damned if I don’t)
No matter how many times I came through for ‘em
Say “No” then I’m a chump
My potna’s son got hit, they left him slumped
Family didn’t have no life insurance, 14 dollars a month
$3600 for a cremate (Cremate)
75 for a proper burial to send him home the right way
Live by the shovel, you die by the dirt
These hyenas is hungry, don’t wanna be they dessert
Sellin’ the candy gets old, been doing that shit for years
Tired of looking out and leaping fences like a deer
It’s your people from Magazine, I should be in People magazine
Niggas out here moving mean, every day a crime scene
It’s bad out here, they’ll peel you like a scab (Like a scab)
Out here they dirty lowdown, Boz Scaggs

[Chorus: Too $hort + E-40]
You gotta look out
For your mama, your sister, and the kids
You know it ain’t safe where they live
You gotta look out
For little cutie on the block with the braids
She bound to end up on the blade (On the blade?)
You gotta look out
For little homie that just did ten
So he never go back to the pen
You gotta look out
Little homie got a lot of potential
But he can’t stop living by the pistol
You gotta look out

[Verse 2: Too $hort + (E-40)]
Same name and they look like you (They look like you)
Loved ones, you don’t have to say I do (Say I do)
‘Cause it’s life or death, I’m here 'til the end (Uh)
Just buried a friend, don’t wanna do it again (Unh-uh)
But we family (Family), we do whatever it takes
If we wanna survive, we share what we make
(Share what we make)
If you ballin’, I ain’t sayin’ give it away
You got a lot of food, nigga, make me a plate (Make me a plate)
That’s the politics (Politics), you can’t stop it, player (Nah)
Me and 40 Water, yeah, we job creators (Real ones)
And all my niggas from The Town get down (Dealers)
We been making money, been moving around (Moving around)
White collar, blue collar, pop collars (Pop collars)
Street niggas with a whole lot of dollars (Paper)
Weak niggas got a whole lot of problems (Haters)
I can’t relate ‘cause we mobbin’ (Mobbin')

[Chorus: Too $hort + E-40]
You gotta look out
For your mama, your sister, and the kids
You know it ain’t safe where they live
You gotta look out
For little cutie on the block with the braids
She bound to end up on the blade (On the blade?)
You gotta look out
For little homie that just did ten
So he never go back to the pen
You gotta look out
Little homie got a lot of potential
But he can’t stop living by the pistol
You gotta look out

[Verse 3]
[E-40]
UH! She was bad but he got sprung and fell in love with her
Little did he know, my pimp potna sent her
He got mad when he seen her with the next nigga
Nigga beat her ass, caught a case in Denver
He didn’t know he was trickin’, he thought he had a good one (SIKE!)
‘Til they took him downtown and they booked him (YIKES!)
Soil star, known for pushing crystal and tar
That’s what they found when they impounded his car (His Chevy)
[Too $hort + (E-40)]
You better run, muthafucka, you don’t wanna surrender
With your life in the hands of the public defender
Because the District Attorney is his best friend (Best friend)
He gave you his word, ‘You’ll get less than ten’
But when the judge said ’25 years’ in your face
You coulda got a good lawyer and beat that case (Beat that case)
They ‘bout to send you to hell and back (Hell and back)
You fucked up, and fell in the trap (You fell in it)

[Chorus: Too $hort + E-40]
You gotta look out
For your mama, your sister, and the kids
You know it ain’t safe where they live
You gotta look out
For little cutie on the block with the braids
She bound to end up on the blade (On the blade?)
You gotta look out
For little homie that just did ten
So he never go back to the pen
You gotta look out
Little homie got a lot of potential
But he can’t stop living by the pistol
You gotta look out…
