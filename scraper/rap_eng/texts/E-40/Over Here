[Intro]
Look at your girl over there in the club
With them binoculars on, my nigga
She wanna be over here
She wanna be over here here here


[Hook : Eric Belliger]
Better get your wife
She been tryna sneak away all night
And she just my type
So you better not let er out of your sight
She been lookin' for a real nigga her whole life, yeah
Got my feet on the couch
And the DJ's yelling my name so loud
While you walkin' around
She's headin over to me right now
Yeah


[Hook : Eric Bellinger]
She wanna be over here here here
She wanna be over here here here
She wanna be over here here here
(With me and my niggas only, me and my niggas only)
She wanna be over here here here
(With me and my niggas only, me and my niggas only)
She wanna be over here


[Verse 2 : Eric Bellinger]
Better get yo girl (you better get it)
For she be over here rockin my world
Better get yo lady
Cause she gon' end up naked
Doin' all the things you love to me
Got my feet on the couch
And the DJ's yelling my name so loud
While you walkin around
She's headin over to me right now


[Hook : Eric Bellinger]
She wanna be over here here here
She wanna be over here here here
She wanna be over here here here
(With me and my niggas only, me and my niggas only)
She wanna be over here here here
(With me and my niggas only, me and my niggas only)
She wanna be over here


[Verse 3 : E-40]
Lord yeah no makeup
She goin' through a breakup
Tired of that clown
Bout to let her head down
Fuck you, pay her
All the ugly bitches hate her
Bad than a motherfucker
Make a nigga never wanna use a rubber
Hot girl, like to drink then come here
Just like that I appear, rub my hands on that hair
On them cookies at the double tree hotel
Pullin on a remi with pony tail
Big ass butt, big ass boobs
Everything big like Texas
Hermes bag, Tyler Bainley shoes
Pussy smell so fresh


[Hook : Eric Bellinger]
She wanna be over here here here
She wanna be over here here here
She wanna be over here here here
(With me and my niggas only, me and my niggas only)
She wanna be over here here here
(With me and my niggas only, me and my niggas only)
She wanna be over here
