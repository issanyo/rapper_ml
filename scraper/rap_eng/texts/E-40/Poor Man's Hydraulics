[Hook]
I punch the gas, I hit the brakes (x4)

The poor man's hydraulics (x4)

[Verse 1]
Yokin' it up, tearin' it up
Wakin' 'em up, showin' my butt
Serving some weight, having my cake
Acting a ape, smoking my grapes

Lifted and splifted, whiskeyed and twisted
Me and my niggas get it and fit it
Makin' 'em mad, makin' 'em sad
Love to boast, love to brag

Slangin' them raps, selling these tracks
Up in ya broad, up in ya batch
My trunk is throbbing, my system knock
My amps is making my woofers pop

Fully refurbished, fully restored
70' Cutlass stick in the floor
Turfin' and crumpin', snapping and stepping
Trappin' and slumming, bangin' and reppin'

[Hook]
I punch the gas, I hit the brakes (x4)

The poor man's hydraulics (x4)

[Verse 2]
Get it to the right, get it to the left
Make your tires bounce like a insufficient check
Make your car dance like a dance contest
Do some acrobatics till it lead to your arrest

Exciting, joyriding
High siding, big timing
Brand new shocks, rebuilt motor
What color paint is that? - Chocolate Mocha

Chrome lips, chrome tips
Chrome everywhere, chrome on my hip
Reputable, intellectual
I'm trying to fit you in my schedule

Sticking and moving, reducing my prices
Adjusting my rates, bringin' new clients
Checking my traps, running my route
Collecting my snaps, peeling on out

[Hook]
I punch the gas, I hit the brakes (x4)

The poor man's hydraulics (x4)

[Bridge]
Get it off the ground (x8)

[Verse 3]
Look at me squat, look at me mash
Look at me yoke, look at me smash
Oh, me, I ain't playin'
Oh, me, I'm my biggest fan

Me no cupcake, me no mark
Me no sucka, me got heart
289, 454
Fresh outta impound, fresh outta tow

He so foolish, I concur
Roger that, aye, aye sir
Unusual slump, dinormous slap
He off a blunt, he on that yatch

Show casing, car racing
Ice skating, lane changing
Heads or tails, flipping a coin
Bill of sales everyday morn

[Hook]
I punch the gas, I hit the brakes (x4)

The poor man's hydraulics (x4)

I punch the gas, I hit the brakes (x4)

The poor man's hydraulics (x4)

[Bridge]
Get it off the ground (x8)
