[Verse 1]
Woke up in the A.M., toasted out of my cranium
Gotta take a shit, took a dump in the Mediterranean
Flushed the toilet, hit the shower
Snatched a fit up out the clos'
Mauser C-96 broomhandle hangin half-way out my drawers
You niggas better feel me I got patrons to serve
Nigga got to starts pay props will deserve
Fuck my trucky, I'm smobbin' ugly in my do dirt ducky
On my way to see this Chiminey
'Cause see this Chiminey is a good friend of me
She likes to go ah, downtown
She likes it when I, pound pound
Here's a whoppin' bedrockin', call me Buh-uh-Barney Rubble
Sticked the bitch down so tough had the pussy poppin bubbles
Scratchin the paint off up of the walls
Diggin' off in them drawers, rebel without a pause
Sheet full of nut stains, swimmin' in Niagara Falls
Mild mannered, extra mail, manish in the place
All up in your motherfuckin' tall can face
Sleep, slept, get woke, Forty Water ain't no joke
Make way, say hey, check my display
Bump this shit 'til your tape break
(Bump this shit 'til ya tape break)
And you's a bitch if you ain't got no Click tape
(And you's a bitch if you ain't got no Click tape)

[Hook]
40 drunk a forty to the fuckin dome
And now they got me spittin on the microphone...
And now they got me spittin on the microphone
And now they got me spittin on the microphone...
40 drunk a forty to the fuckin dome
And now they got me spittin on the microphone, beeatch!
Drunker than a motherfucker spittin that shit

[Verse 2]
High rank, nigga pull
Stack scratch taller than Manute Bol
Cash rules everything around me
40 Water-Water get the money
?[Oh tell me baby gon' be no catchin', bet ya catch before 40 7-11]?
Ah bih-uh-big Benz, sc-uh-scared men can't wih-uh-win, uh
1-Luv to my niggas in the You Know
Gettin' swoll, bulkin' up, drinkin' pruno
Y'all save me somethin', got some extra woo wops, I think I need a drink
The way they got me fucked might be in right there which is sooner than I think
Vallejo PD's on crack, mayne
They shot my nigga Tone Tucker in the back, mayne
Prejudiced motherfuckers!
What niggas need to do is start luh-uh-loccin' up
Squash the fuh-ah-funk and start nuh-uh-nuthin', uh (Squash it)
Heckler & Koch collection staple, a highly easy
To be converted to Mack-1-Twice as righteous (righteous)
Make them po-po's like us
Drink with me, second base, and I'm going for home
I drunk a 40 to the fuckin dome

[Hook]
40 drunk a forty to the fuckin dome
And now they got me spittin on the microphone, beeatch!
Drunker than a muthafucka spittin that shit
Drunker than a muthafucka spittin that shit

[Verse 3]
I ain't no cupcake (I ain't no cupcake)
So don't call me Hostess (Hostess)
Nigga, don't you know that I'm all off into explosives?
(BOOM! BOOM!)
Don't let the bed bugs bite, sleep light
Be ready for the tip-toein bandits at night
When I open infrared (when I open infrared)
Sportin somethin for the haters
Terminator, instigator, nigga just bought from Traders
Potna, let me borrow some of that fetti
You got it made, your life is set
Why you ungrateful motherfucka, you better get somewhere where they love you at
I done struggled and strived so hard to make my shit obese (uh)
Pacin' back and forth (uh), forever grittin' my teeth
C-C-L-L-I-I-C-K, Northern California, V-uh-a-VJ
Sick Wid It ambitiousness, bump Da fuckin Bumble
Soundin' off car alarms, my shit ain't nothin humble
Gotta say wassup to some niggas on my team
Niggas like Greg Street and Ricky motherfuckin Green

[Hook]
I drunk a forty to the fuckin dome
And now they got me spittin on the microphone
And now they got me spittin on the microphone
And now they got me spittin on the microphone

40 drunk a forty to the fuckin dome
And now they got me spittin on the microphone, beeatch!
Drunker than a muthafucka spittin this shit
Drunker than a muthafucka spittin that shit
Drunker than a muthafucka spittin this shit
