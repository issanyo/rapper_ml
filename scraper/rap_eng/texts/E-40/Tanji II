[Verse 1]
Tanji, (Tanji) I snatched her up at a house party (house party)
Her appearance was quite lovely
I wanted to get plugged with old baby
So I told my older cousin to introduce me
She did that indeed
She said Tanji (Tanji)
Tanjii this is  E
E?  You mean E40 from The V?
I said yeah, she said glad to meet you E
I said obliged, glad to meet you too
She said right (right)
So tell what’s up with you?
I said nathan (nathan)
How bout some steak and wine and an autograph?
I scratched the top of my head and then I started to laugh
Let’s scoot to my spot, in what?
My Cutlass Supreme drop, where’s that?
Outside in the parking lot, let’s scat
We’ll be there with a jiffy, now sit back
Dag nammit I ain't taking no crap
She said man baby is it like that?
I love for a man to take control, over 250 gallon and bold
She kissed me and then continued down the road
Stay tuned for the next episode

[Chorus]
Tanji
Tan, Tan, Tanji
Tan, tan, tan, ta, ta, ta, tan, Tanji
Tanji
Tan, Tan, Tanji
Tan, tan, tan, ta, ta, ta, tan, Tanji
I snatched her up at a house party
I snatched her up at a house party
I snatched her up at a house party

[Verse 2]
Tan, Tan, Tanji episode 2
Take an educated guess, precisely
Tanji get’s undressed, bingo
Gigantic size breasts with those jingle
B-E-L-L-S  I said groovy, this here’s totally happening
As my duck, stood straight up and started quacking
Pull over, the next stop is a rest area, smiling
As I peeped the posterior
Hmm it was quite impressive
She said E-40 time to get aggressive
Splendid as I grin-ded
Plugged it as I slipped in
Yeah, yeah I’m just a hustler
And with a black jack jimmy I'll thrust ya
Radical on a late night pursuit
Wonderful this could happen to you
She rode me like a cowgirl from Texas
We’ll return after these here messages

[Chorus]
Tanji
Tan, Tan, Tanji
Tan, tan, tan, ta, ta, ta, tan, Tanji
E-40 from the V?
E-E-E-E-40 from the V?
I snatched her up at a house party

[Verse 3]
A month later
I’m rollin, in my 1992 Sterling
Lookin' federal and stupid stuck what the fuck?
Who is this pulling up on the side a me?
Oh It looks like Tanji, with a car full a girls that can’t stand me
I said Tanji, I said Tanji, Tanji, Tanji is that you?
She said what you think?
I like your new hair do, she said oh
I see you still living comfortable, I said so?
These kinda things can come and go
She said hey bro we need to conversate
I said cool meet me at my house at 8
8 O’clock comes and not a minute too late here comes Tanji
Tanji and I’m feeling great
Tanji you got some now or later
She said why, you been drinking Brandy Separators?
I said true, but for the last time just to relieve
That there stress of mine, she said mm
But anyway I got some good news and some bad news
She said the bad news too much sexing
The good news I’m expecting
I said good, good who’s the lucky Dad?
She said you 40, honey aren’t you glad?
I said impossible, it couldn’t be
'Cause I’m righteously married with a girl from the V
Yeah, I’m just a hustler
And with a black jack jimmy I’ll thrust ya

[Outro]
E-40 from the V
Tanji
E-40 from the V

E-40 from the V
Tanji
I snatched her up at a house party
