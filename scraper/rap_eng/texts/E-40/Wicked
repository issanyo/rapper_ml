[Chorus: Rich Rocka]
This shit's so wicked
Look at my life, I get paid just to kick it
This shit's so wicked
I hit the club through the back, out there stickin'
This shit's so wicked
I might go viral the way that they flickin' (wicked)
This shit's so wicked
If I go vegan, I'm still gon' get chicken (wicked)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Well damn, another muthafuckin' slappy
Make your mammy wanna slap your pappy
Make your motorcycle pop a wheelie
Figure 8, make your 50 do a 360
Hit the brake, then you punch on the gas
Fog it up, bang on they bitch ass
Give it up, act a muthafuckin' fool
Ape shit, pack a muthafuckin' tool
Extended clip introduce you to the Reaper
I got hammers that'll stick ya and they'll sleep ya
Known gunners that'll hit you out the park
Not no bunters, they'll finish what they start (BIATCH!)

[Chorus: Rich Rocka]
This shit's so wicked
Look at my life, I get paid just to kick it (wicked)
This shit's so wicked
I hit the club through the back, out there stickin' (wicked)
This shit's so wicked
I might go viral the way that they flickin' (wicked)
This shit's so wicked
If I go vegan, I'm still gon' get chicken (wicked)

[Verse 2: E-40]
I've been taking a nip and drinking the same fifth for days
Smoking big turtle with my colleagues
My co-workers and co-defendants
For many years we've been in business
Nigga used to be hella solid, now he fragile
Acting just like a pussy, a vaginal
That's the way they be switching up, I don't condone it
If you a bitch, you a bitch, own it
I'm a Cali boy, hoe, I thought that you should thought
Live on the edge on the San Andreas Fault
Being a sucker ain't the way that I was taught
You woulda thought it was a food fight the way they throwing salt
If I keep moving this fast, I'll probably get a ticket
I'll give you a joog, a bargain like the Garment District
You want some funk? I'll bring the smoke like a brisket
Play with my bread, then I'ma hit you with the biscuit (BIATCH!)

[Chorus: Rich Rocka]
This shit's so wicked
Look at my life, I get paid just to kick it (wicked)
This shit's so wicked
I hit the club through the back, out there stickin' (wicked)
This shit's so wicked
I might go viral the way that they flickin' (wicked)
This shit's so wicked
If I go vegan, I'm still gon' get chicken (wicked)
