Eeuungghh

[Verse 1]
Uhh
I'm elevated
I'm floating on cloud nine times out of ten
You can find me with a cup in my hand
Filled to the rim with oil
Throwing up the middle finger
But I'm not an alcoholic I'm just a serious social drinker
Heavy thinking, thumper toting, don't trust nobody but I
Cause the scandalous be plotting, and if they could they would try
Like last night at the club
God as my witness
I was sitting at my table
Minding my own business
Living it up to the highest
Like every day is Christmas
A sucker tried to try us
Hating on our riches
I guess they didn't like us
Cause we got all the bitches
But they didn't want to fight us
Cause my niggas we the shiznit
Fuck compromising, explaining, and trying to reason
We'll catch 'em outside of the club and leave them niggas leakin'
I be beastin

[Hook]
One lonely beasty I be!
(Beast don't suck up to none, don't be no sucka)

[Verse 2]
When my money was hecka small
I made it look like it was tall
Punch a hater up in his jaw
If he didn't want to shake my paw
When I used to push that raw
On the other side of the law
Where the prices fluctuate and go up and down like a see-saw
Nah this ain't no hee-hah
Clown shit, this real
I slap a busta with the heel of my hammer up out my skrill
I take a uptempo track
Put some game behind my rap
I'm like that
Motherfucker I'm a mack
Hide yo back
Before she fuck around and get snatched
I'm from the flats
The Hillside to be exact
Cattin off and sipping ain't what this playa do son
There's only like seven real niggas left on this earth
And I'm one of them
I be beastin, bitch da man'e, mannish little old heathen
The rawest nigga speaking
They call me Earl Stevens

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Bosses do what they want
Suckas do what they can
Aauuaauuaaggghh
I'm feelin like Tarzan
Gotta pocket full of money and I'm confident
Gotta fifth of landy cognac and some romulan
Some romulan?
Yeah, some cheebah
It's handling but my strain of choice, is sativa
When she was young she wasn't looking all that tight take Meagan Good for example
Now she looking right
I'm about to take her down tonight
I be beastin in the bed
I like 'em dark, light and bright
Yellow-bone and red
I'm loaded and I'm twisted and I'm faded!
In the function gettin' white boy wasted!
Blankin, zooted, poonded, wounded
Out my, body, something, stupid

[Hook]
