Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Ayee mama, I know the weedman!
Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Weedman, hes my friend. [x2]

[Verse 1:]
The weedman, the cannibus pack, the vegetables, the lettuce man, the hydrogen laugh
The cure, the grass, the medicine, the farmers, the club, the growers and the citizens
The caters, the champ that amped um for the marching bands
You will wanna learn this dance, side to side from left to right like this wit yo hands
You one of my loyalest customers, you know I ain't gone get ya
Ima slide through there in a minute & Ima smoke somethin' witcha
This week I'm runnin' a special, I'm tryna have my doe, this week I'm lettin' um go for like 250 a O
Some of us sellin' pills, some of us sellin' blow
Some of us got meals, & some of us is poor
Thats why I'm lettin' um go for the low low, duckin' & ditchin' & dodgin' the po po
Gettin' um off for cheap, no boy, competitors can't compete, my prices is hard to beat
Affordable tryna stay on my feet, shippin' & handlin', gamblin' my turkey bags don't leak
Bieeetch!

Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Ayee mama, I know the weedman!
Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Weedman, hes my friend. [x2]

[Verse 2:]
On the hush hush, the majority of the time I don't really like to flamboast to much
Cause the jealous will drop a dime & try too tell on us
In my line of work not even your bestfriend ya trust, thas why I always pack a 9 in case I gotta bust
Speakin' of bust I think that rhymes with cannibus
Marijawana & I'm the provider who gotta lighter
Higher & higher, the new thing is a vaporizer, the other day ago they had to rush my folks to kaiser
Cause his heart was skippin' a beat & it was off track, but really & truly my folks was havin' a panic attack
Everybody ain't built to reef, but some of us smoke from the time we wake up too the time we go to sleep
I'm on my way back from New Mexico on my 7th tank of petro
In my new school Lincoln Navi, with my decoy right behind me
Takin' the back roads, customers on hold, soon as I get in the city limits this sh't is good as sold
Bieeetch!

Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Ayee mama, I know the weedman!
Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Weedman, hes my friend. [x2]

[Verse 3:]
UGHH! I got that white widow, that sour diesel, them northern lights, that kush, that afghani
That champagne, that purple haze I push. Indoor, outdoor either or it don't matter
Smoking weed is therapuetic & healin', weed is a muscle relaxer. Its more right than wrong, it helped me write this song
You might get the munchies & eat a muthafu'ka out they house & home
Alot of us smoke the hooka, alot of us smoke the bong, swisher sweets, backwoods, zig zags, or a cone
My harvest game is sick, my strains & my seeds, my potnah got a DUI for smoking too much weed
You can look me right in the eye & tell that I'm keyed
Cataracts, cannibus card, its hard too see & read
Bieeetch!

Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Ayee mama, I know the weedman!
Ayee mama, I know the weedman! Weedman, hes my friend. [x2]
