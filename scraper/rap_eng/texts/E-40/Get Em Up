[Chorus]
I get em up (x 9)
You ain’t doing nuttin I ain't doin, I get em up (x5)
Air force 3

[Verse 1]
Pop goes the weasle please please o please
Put down the mic, mic unless you coming tight
No props deserved raps to the curve
Suckas get served especially when I’m purred
So here comes the o jack don’t crack respect
Lyric from the hillside beat down pat
Take ya ass to the whoop troop ally hoop, ally hoop
Come up off my scratch jack pay me my loot
Got hoes like a pimp when I’m clowning these sips
Does that are tempted will be treated like wimps
Down and dirty about my print out, I got chin ups for a busta
Relax I’m talkin when I win I must though
Let us suck ya booty habit it if he calls back
Don’t let me grab my terminator automatic
Do you think that I think that you got the power
Do you know that I know that you just a coward
Eh you wanna act hard caz you caz you drank some shit
Better sober up before you make me chuck ya chin
Back up or backed up caz I can’t be moved
Give up or gave up caz you  a fool
It’s 1990 some’n what’s mine I’ll take it
Makin revenues bringing home the bacon
Don’t get upset caz it’s ya rap I’m ruinin
You ain’t doing nuttin I ain't doin

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Money, money, money by the ton
Ooh stay up late and watch time boo
Turn the channel remote control, Donny Simpson video soul
Shake and bake us, suckas can’t fade us
Studio Tony, 40, Mugzie, D shot ain't legit
Capital, taty, mc seany, suga, he made the click
Sold a bunch a units on the ground ooh
Neva could be a busta or brown (brown)
My town in B town so what’s up with you
I doubt it very really seriously you wanna see ma crew
1,2, pass me a brew, 3,4, I need some more
Supercalifragilistic, the suckas don’t know us
That we be dealing drugs from the tallest cooking shows
Through with money, no not me E 4 naughty don’t rap for free
Gang related, I am I overrated, do you suckas hate it
So put ya dukes up

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
East, me, Son, Chi
Step up in to the party tardy
Grab the mike, juice the crowd
Spit some game, they go wild
Ooh ahh ooh ooh ah la la la la la (x2)
Got my boys in the back, ridin in the drop
Peepin out the seem with the mug on mean
Ooh hoo, yeah yeah (x2)

[Chorus][x2]
