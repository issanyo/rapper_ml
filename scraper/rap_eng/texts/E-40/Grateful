[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
No more wrong and I'm tryna do right
Thank God for my kids and my lovely wife
The life I used to live, I had to leave it alone
'Cause my backbone was 'bout to get it alone
What's a man to gain the world and not share?
Everything I went through helped me prepare
For the day that I talk like this
And I'm sure that Jesus walked like this
It's a fact though, exacto
Rewriting my rap flow
Come as you are, I'm posted up at the backdoor
Church panic, I'll be making the plans
Kissing their babies and shaking their hands
Man, God gave me my life back then He brought my wife back
I'm suited and booted, praising His name
Through my trials and tribulations, I'm grateful for everything

[Chorus: Tyrese]
I'm so grateful
I'm so humbled by Your love
Oh why
Where would I be without Your love?
(Where would I be without Your love?)
Said I, said I owe it all to You
Said I, said I owe it all to You, Father

[Verse 2: E-40]
Uh
You the truth
You always have had my back like a masseuse
When I was funkin' on the gravel
You would always fight my battles
The beginning, and the end, the most high
I'm hoping I get to meet You when I die
You the only one make me cry
Especially when we don't see eye to eye
When I hear the choir sing and the preacher preach
And the missionaries speaking in tongues, my aunties, uh
Trials and tribulations
All you need is the faith of a mustard seed, be gracious
And Lord, I'm grateful for my kids
And my soulmate, my rib
Gotta be strong, never be weak
Get on your knees and thank God you on your feet
Talk to 'em Tyrese

[Chorus: Tyrese]
I'm so grateful
I'm so humbled by Your love
Oh why
Where would I be without Your love?
(Where would I be without Your love?)
Said I, said I owe it all to You
Said I, said I owe it all to You, Father

[Verse 3: Tyrese]
I thank God for my life
My wife and my children
I thank God
Said I owe it all to You
Oh, I thank you, Jesus
Oh, I thank you, Jesus
For protecting my whole family, yeah
Lord, I know I could've been dead and gone
But You're not done with me
Oh, baby
Thank You for sparing my life, Jesus
It means that You're not done with me, yeah, oh
Oh, baby
Oh, whoa, whoa
(Where would I be without Your love?)
