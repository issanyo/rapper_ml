[Intro: Kid Ink]
Ah yeah
(Nard & B)
Ah yeah
40, oh-oh-oh
Girl I think
My, 2 seater
It's Kid Ink

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Girl I think you should come along
Just leave your friends at home
Girl, 'cause ain't no room up in my 2
Ain't no room up in my 2, 2 seater
My, my 2 seater
2 seater
2 seater
My, 2 seater

[Verse 1: E-40]
Uh
I'm a ganged up individual, and I'm a fixture
I ain't pitiful, I don't be talking to no pillows
I ain't got time to be lolly gagging
I ain't got no time to be out here laggin'
Ain't no slacking in my maccing
I'm a boss
Thought that nigga over there a tail
He been dipped in sucker sauce
Get lost
That's what his broad told me
She told me he hella weak, he hella soft
When it come to score then I'm a pro
She try to tell me a long time ago, she won't do no more
She said he was a hoe
I said "I know and you gon' tell him when to go"
I'm paid like a parking meter, big homie in Senerita
He told me, he find it good, when you prolly should keep her
She know I'm a hoodler, but I'm intelligent too
She know that I'm relevant and that I'm making these moves

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Girl I think you should come along
Just leave your friends at home
Girl, 'cause ain't no room up in my 2
Ain't no room up in my 2, 2 seater
My, my 2 seater
2 seater
2 seater
My, 2 seater

[Verse 2: E-40]
I never hit you and ball up my knuckles
We can just fucking cuddle
Be like Jay-Z and Bee, we can be a power couple
Both of us from the struggle, when all we know what's the hustle
When it's time to re-butter we gather up in the Huttle
No I'm not a captain or a hope detector
We can take the battery out the smoke detector
Put a [?] in the dough
Puff a little drough
Take the innocent out your purse, they can smell it next door
Dress casual, not like we going to the prom
I booked this room on hotels.com
Do not disturb sign trynna get a piece of mine
Spill a little cutie-quality time
Good sex, got my name tatted on her chest
Do some freaky things, she can tell to her BFF
It's amazing, it's a special occasion

[Hook: Kid Ink]
Girl I think you should come along
Just leave your friends at home
Girl, 'cause ain't no room up in my 2
Ain't no room up in my 2, 2 seater
My, my 2 seater
2 seater
2 seater
My, 2 seater
