[Chorus]
Movin organized business,(mah) money over bitches (mah)
(x4)

[Verse 1]
I was talkin to one a ma folks that I looked up to (who was it?)
My advisor
He said that it’s good to always have a extra set a eyes like a jumping spider
I said, ‘Yea I got ma security wit me’
But then you gotta be outta yo fuckin minds to think Ima be be one to seal you up and do you in
Peel ya, that’ll be gang duty, mayne they face too familiar
I got people who dey don’t even know I know (know I know)
Cause I ain’t playin no sucka fo noone’s show
For no money they’ll hop over all your fences, as long as I take care a their expenses
Jus a waste for all of us be jumpin around as fools
Killers on call (call), holes in ya like a wolf a ball (ball)
Confetti light weight char, that’s before when I was small (small)
As I got older, decided to go against the fuckin law (law)
If you ain’t built fo this, don’t get into this (don’t get into thist)
If you ain’t built fo this, don’t get into this (don’t get into thist)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Yea he mobbin this I swear, he be mobbin everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
If one knee on the line he dare, he be mobbin everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere
Everywhere, everywhere

[Verse 2]
We out here starrin ma nigga, don’t be a bore
You ain’t the only one nigga, leave me alone
What you be questionin
There’s a shortage and it’s dry, that’s why I call so high (high)
And I ain’t tryna get over ma feelins, I’m jus tryna get by
I can see it in yo eye, I can tell you not a spy
My intuitions tell me you sincere and you a good guy
So I’m gonna give you a try, and put you through the test
See if you got a hidden agenda, or if you smurfette
See if you’d surrender and give us up if you get nervous
See if you a poser or clown, this ain’t no circus
Cause if half the game on the rip,then Ima pat you on the back
My mentor taught me that so I always remember that
That’s why I’m sharper than a gillette or a yoshi blade I’m good like that
I never been a riff raff, with the foofoo or chitchat

[Chorus]
