[Intro: Too $hort + Rankin Scroo]
I got a gang of ‘em
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang

[Verse 1: Too $hort]
I got cars, a whole lotta broads
Go to all the best parties with a whole lotta stars
Niggas dream about being me
Cameras start flashing and you see him on TMZ
I got a whole lot of years, under my belt
Made a lot of good music, something you felt
A lotta haters don’t like my style
But when they play my song, your wife goes wild
How many hoes you think Too $hort fucked?
I bet you Wilt Chamberlain didn’t fuck that much (What?)
I always see him with a bunch of sluts
Love to bust nuts and don’t ever get enough
Get mad, but don’t push me
How can one man get so much pussy?
They call me daddy, it’s not a big thang, son
I gotta game, that’s why I got a gang of ‘em

[Hook: Rankin Scroo + E-40]
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang-gang-guh-guh
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang-gang
I got a gang of ‘em
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang-gang
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang-gang
We got a gang of ‘em, mayne

[Verse 2: E-40]
I got a gang of slang and a gang of game
For a dame, get in her brain
Granddaddy purp, strawberry kush, all kinds of cannabis strains
Never teasing like David Blaine, medicated, I’m high as a plane
Hella people be knowing my name (name), Spokane to Spain
When I came up out the cervix, face was full of joy
The doctors and nurses hollered out “He a boy!”
The real McCoy, didn’t play with toys, warrior like Troy
Me and my gang making hella noise, dodging the elroys
She says that I’m what she been missing
She like the way that I be spittin’
You can find me on the soil, either that or television
I represent the Bay, Vallejo, Frisco, Oakland, Richmond
Cook yayo up in the kitchen, taking chances on going to prison
Counterclockwise whippin’, on my profit, profit flippin’
Getting all my gouda, got rid of my triple-beam
On a microphone and computer, gold and platinum, mayne
I got a…

[Hook: Rankin Scroo + Beeda Weeda]
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang-gang-guh-guh
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang-gang
I keep a gang of ‘em
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang-gang-guh-guh
Gang-guh-guh-gang-guh-gang-guh-gang-gang

[Verse 3: Beeda Weeda]
Beeda Weeda! I’m in this thang with a gang of ‘em
OJ, stupid, running game on ‘em
Right up out the parking lot, four, five dames
Stepped up in the spot with the 4-5 thang on him
PYTs in the VIP, gotta car full of gas but I’m still on E
Say her man in the club but she still on me
Got the grant from Uncle $hort, that’s a trill OG
I’m like (BITCH! BITCH!) Yeah, gon’ do that
400 dollar jeans, I’m like “True dat”
40 bottles, 40 freaks, I run through that
She was frontin’, now she wanna speak
Well, bitch, you blew that
Who dat, say they wanna slide with a pimp player
Black, Asian, Latin, Spanish, why? I’m a real player
Then fit ‘em all in a ride, north to the haters
Pull up in an ice cream truck with them different flavors

[Hook: Rankin Scroo + (Beeda Weeda) + all]
