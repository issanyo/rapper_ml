[Too $hort]
It's that high
The pussy's just like dope
It's that dope

Even, if, you don't, want no mo'
Even if you don't want no mo'
The pussy's just like dope

First time you got a shot, you was hooked
When she walked into your life, you never shoulda looked
Ain't no rehab for pussy, it won't hurt me
You just like cigarettes and goin cold turkey
That's all you ever think about
Nasty ass hoes'll give you stank mouth
First thing in the morning, she's on your mind
Twenty minute kisses, all the time
Bomb ass head, hit it from the back
She be ridin yo' dick like a horse bareback
You ever wonder where she learned that?
The bitch'll pull a pimp's perm back
Special handlin, dick's the package
It's mine - you gon' let me have it back bitch?
Good pussy make you fall in love
You better say no to drugs

Chorus: Too $hort

It's like heroin (heroin, heroin)
The pussy's just like dope
Even, if, you don't, want no mo'
The pussy's just like dope

[Too $hort]
I chose to say no to drugs
Pussy throw them thangs beat yo' ass like thugs
Have you whipped, creamin in yo' hand and shit
Call her every day and can't stand the bitch
You old pussy ass sucker niggas
Still love hoes that fuck other niggas
Can't tell you nothin, you need counselin
Fuck that shit, keep poundin it
I'm talkin bout some stay wet
Bustin big nuts in her face shit
Dick thrustin like a spaceship
Red snapper's what I call that pussy
Why you askin stupid questions like would she
Suck yo' dick -- you ain't know?
It was passed down to her from her kinfolks
Momma and her aunties was freaks
Kryptonite pussy got you weak

Chorus

[E-40]
Uh-huh.. OOOH!
Some of these bitches is garden tools, and I don't mean shovels
I mean hoes HOES experts at workin they pussy muscles
Literally (??) over these hoes, niggas'll fight and scrap for
But see I don't play that shit, I beat a bootch down with a belt buckle
The first thing you wanna do is go down on a botch, and eat her crabby
KNOWIN that there botch still got lead in her ass from yesterday
I'm on your botch -- size 44D bodacious breasts
But the bitch got mo' miles on her THAN SOUTHWEST
Don't, you, get it dis-com-bob-u-la-ted (discombobulated)
She used to have a 70's bush - until I shaved it (until I shaved it)
Beatch, beatch!
Now you all in front of her momma's house, blowin your horn
(blowin your horn) All in front of her momma's house, blowin your horn
Suicide, dial that girl for help?  (help?)
Shot up her fam' BAM, returned to grind on yourself

Chorus 2X
