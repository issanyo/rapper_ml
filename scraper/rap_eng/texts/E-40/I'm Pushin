[Intro:]
“What business are you in?”
Oh. I make ma bread an butter. I’m pushin

[Chorus:]
“What business are you in?”
Oh. Well, I make ma bread an butter.I’m pushin
I’m pushin [x3]
“What business are you in?”
Oh. Well, I make ma bread an butter

[Verse 1:]
Tryin' boost my coin, tryin' to have my change, tryin' to stack my cheddar
Tryin' make my fetti grow so tall that it need to sit in the exit row
Knocking pictures up off da wall, speakers 'bout to blow ('bout to blow)
Always speedin' like it’s urgent, like I got to go
Ditchin' and duckin' the racket busters
Tryin' to avoid the beacon
And I don't be hangin out wit suckas
I’m sharper than a sewin needle
I gotta get it while it’s good, but now I make it last
A product of my hood, runnin from my past
A gangsta with a soft centre
God fearing; major repenter
The church door open but I’m scared to enter
Flea flicking and pitching, grittin' feelin' guilty (feelin' guilty)
Knowin that they could have someone tryin to kill me (tryin' to kill me)
Steal me, sneak me- take me from my family!
Pluckin their nerve up that candy
That booger sugar, that white
That stuff they smoke in a pipe
When it come to decisions gotta go wit yo heart not just yo' gut
Better watch these fools today boy, they’ll set you up
(Bitch!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
(I’m pushin) Nasal candy and pickle jars, yowder
(I’m pushin) Gift cards and credit cards, swipin'
(I’m pushin) Clones, trees and weed seeds, veggies
(I’m pushin) Knock off purses and Remy weave, hair
(I’m pushin) I push rhymes like it’s weight
Digital an physical official albums and mixtapes
Stackin' these thousands in public houses
Safe in the safes
Got somethin' to say, not behind yo back, I say it in your face
(Bitch!)
My peoples got that oxy (oxy, oxy)
Molly and kaddafi (dafi, dafi)
Which is somethin' I don’t believe in
Cause these youngstas be OD'ing
I came in the game with a prayer, a wish, and a dream
(Hope and a dream)
See all my folks is up in the jail, locked in the beam (in the beam)
Never told, don't ever tell, never snitched, don't ever sing (never sing)
Tryin' to have some self esteem up in my bloodstream (in my bloodstream)

[Chorus:]
“What business are you in?”
Oh. I make ma bread an butter
I’m pushin (pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin)
What you do?
I’m pushin (pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin)
What you do?
I’m pushin (pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin)
What you do?
I’m pushin (pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin)
What you do?
“What business are you in?”
Oh. I make ma bread an butter

[Verse 3:]
Ooh, how I make my bread and butter?
If I tell ya, I gotta kill ya, bitch, you might be the undercover
(Never know)
Don't be playin' me for a sucka (ah uh)
Don't mistake me for another (another)
Chasin' paper, runnin' from the cops and they tasers (tasers)
Hopin' they don’t shoot me in the skin (in the skin)
Or take me to the state or fed pen (state pen)
I ain’t got my strap sir, don’t shoot me in my back sir
Lord I pray, just get me through this day
Tryin' to survive and stay alive
Me and my family, me and my folks
A lot of my people died when they brought us here on boats
In my history class I cried, writing, taking notes
Make me wanna ride, pop you wit' the toast
(Bitch!)

[Chorus:]
“What business are you in?”
Oh. I make ma bread an butter
I’m pushin (pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin)
What you do?
I’m pushin (pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin)
What you do?
I’m pushin (pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin)
What you do?
I’m pushin (pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin)
What you do?
“What business are you in?” (what you do?)
Oh. I make ma bread an butter (ma bread an butter)
I’m pushin (pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin,pushin, pushin)[x4]
I’m pushin
