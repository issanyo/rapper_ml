Flyer than a motherfucker going off danker
Right hand on my drank left hand on my janx
Slick talker higher than a spaceship
Sky walker on the plane with a trippy stick
I’m tryna take me something home tonight
Rub burns on my knees tonight
Wildin in the cunt, tub

Sell drugs get high and  fuck bitches
Champagne wishes caviar dreams
Everyday is christmas with me and my team

Off a brownie ya edible bitches all on my testicles

Magnum guns, magnum rappers
Range rovers, lambos, phantoms ugh

Standing on couches and pouring up a mutag shower all broads
And he keep pushin it towards my auto march

[Chorus]
