[Intro: Myles Parrish]
P-P-P-Lo time to bring the bass back

[Chorus: P-Lo]
If they hatin' got a price to pay
California on my license plate
Last year they ain't even like the Bay

[Verse 1: P-Lo]
Damn, but we don't never trip
All I know is gas brake dip
No we never trick on that bitch
No I can't quit, no I don't fuck with that mitt
Bitch, but ay... Put me on somethin'

[Hook: P-Lo]
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Yeah we really going dumb
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Yeah we really going dumb

[Chorus: P-Lo]
If they hatin' got a price to pay
California on my license plate
Last year they ain't even like the Bay

[Verse 2: P-Lo]
Damn, had to get it on my own
I could really get it if I want
You can't even get it on the phone
You ain't even know, I be with a bottle getting dumb
I ain't 'gon stop putting on
From the home of the slang, yeah
Bad bitches know my gang, yeah
Big bag with the aim, yeah
You ain't really what you claim
Why you always in the way
Fat ass, little waist
Bet she 'gon make it shake
Say you 'bout it, but you ain't

[Hook: P-Lo]
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Yeah we really going dumb
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Yeah we really going dumb (E-40)

[Verse 3: E-40]
Ugh!
Stop babysitting pass it
My fetti stretched like elastic
Yeah bruh I gotta have it
Born to trap, survival tactics
I'm so spaced, I can't even feel my face
Disrespect get out of place
Then we 'gon put you in your place
Ugh! Bar none
All my little niggas on the run
All my little niggas go dumb
When they pull up on me in the traffic they holla uh

[Hook: P-Lo & E-40]
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Yeah we really going dumb
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Yeah we really going dumb

[Chorus: P-Lo]
If they hatin' got a price to pay
California on my license plate
If they hatin' got a price to pay
California on my license plate

[Hook: P-Lo]
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Yeah we really going dumb
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Put me on somethin'
Yeah we really going dumb
