[Verse:]
Yea its never too late to stay prayed up you dig
Cuz the only way you can get to heaven is to go straight and turn right
And be a father to your babies and a leader to your dame you dig that real
You know you gotta know how to check trap  and trap check and check trap
That need to be trapped checked by a trap checker
