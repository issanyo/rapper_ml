[Intro]
What’s up E mayne, we goin' to a little hookup?
It’s cool, I’m waitin on P and 'em to call me an whatnot
They say as soon as they page me
Hold on here we go, soon as they page me we will do it right here Jus plug it with it
Let’s go do this thang mayne (ok that’s cool, that’s cool)

[Hook: E-40]
I see folks all over the place doing electric slide
The house is bumpin', everybody’s inside
If you step with me, then I’ll step with you
If we step together then we’ll all come through
What’s really goin' on? Can we have some fun?
Get at the ladies and put down the guns
Read our mail and get paid on da gooch
Form a team and unite into a group
This here way: we cannot be stopped
Enjoy the scene and do the club hop
Regardless of what, this you can’t ignore
Everybody struck to the floor

[Chorus]
Everybody go
E-E E-E Everybody go
E-E E-E Everybody go on
E-E E-E Everybody go
E-E E-E (He drives me crazy)

[Verse 1: E-40]
Come along, come along with me
From out tha wood work it’s E-40
No beatin' round the cocoa plant, straight to the point
Just like dank I’m bout to vibe this joint
Go on and fetch you a companion
My duty is to make sure nobody’s abandoned
I put this here on everything I love
If you get up and bug then you got plug (he drives me crazy)
Freak baby girl then spit
I know that’s the way it’s done by The Click
Ain’t none of that shammin', fakin' or barkin'
Straight club hoppin (he drives me crazy)

[Hook: E-40]
I see folks all over the place doing electric slide
The house is bumpin', everybody’s inside
If you step with me, then I’ll step with you
If we step together then we’ll all come through
What’s really goin' on? Can we have some fun?
Get at the ladies and put down the guns
Read our mail and get paid on da gooch
Form a team and unite into a group
This here way: we cannot be stopped
Enjoy the scene and do the club hop
Regardless of what, this you can’t ignore
Everybody struck to the floor

[Chorus]
Everybody go
E-E E-E Everybody go
E-E E-E Everybody go on
E-E E-E Everybody go on and dance if you
(He drives me crazy)

[Verse 2: E-40]
I had to like push my way up in this here industry
MCs wanted to get wit' me but really and truly I don’t have time to see
I’m out here handlin' my business in and out the studio, gettin' my productions goin'
They say 40 you got to clean up yo act if you wanna receive seniority
Airplay points and all that
I was like mayne, I think I understand, I know it’s gonna be hard
But I need to come up wit' a fresh new game plan (he drives me crazy)
Woo-woo-oo-oo-woo sounded dapper, while I was messin' around pushin' buttons on tha sampler
Whatever you wanna call it and whatnot, the beat was knockin'
Straight club hoppin'

[Hook: E-40]
I see folks all over the place doing electric slide
The house is bumpin', everybody’s inside
If you step with me, then I’ll step with you
If we step together then we’ll all come through
What’s really goin' on? Can we have some fun?
Get at the ladies and put down the guns
Read our mail and get paid on da gooch

[Chorus]
Everybody go
E-E E-E Everybody go on
E-E E-E Everybody go on
E-E E-E E-Everybody
E-Everybody (He drives me crazy)

[Verse 3: E-40]
Mini-skirts boomin', but you know I’m not up for groovin', plottin' and consumin'
Puttin' to use my old school steps
Now I’m pumped like a punk on a keg I can’t rest (he drives me crazy)
I even got the security guards goin'
Lettin' a gang of people in free and talk 'bout this one’s on me
Proppin': proper and poppin'
A gang related theme defines The Click, I’m off in there
Yeah, that’s the plan, caught up in somethin that I do belive in
She was lovin' every minute of the speech that I was droppin'
Straight club hoppin' (he drives me crazy)

[Outro]
I like to shoot a cut out to my sohab [?]
