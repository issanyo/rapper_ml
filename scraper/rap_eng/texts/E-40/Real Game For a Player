[Verse 1]
UH, mob the fuck out
Looking up with something to prove on my mind
For niggas that hate on me and they doubt
‘Cause it’s a drought on us real people like E-Feasible
Suckers wanna block my shine like a gazebo
Standing outside of the burrito placing my order
Posted up with the pistol tucked, my biggest supporter
Ran across my OG, he got hella chirren
He been pimpin’ since dinosaur urine
I handed my nigga the dank, he hit it and gave it back
He told it make him think, he used to be on crack
Now he doing hella good, hella love in the hood
Having his scratch
Back in, everywhere he going is Cadillac
Real game for a player…BIATCH!

[Hook]
Real game for a player
(Yeah, and that’s game)
Real game for a player (Hell yeah)
(Mmm-hmm, real game for a player)
Real game for a player
(Yeah, and that’s game)
Real game for a player
(Hell yeah)
For a player

[Verse 2]
UH!
Corner to corner, ave to ave, tycoonin’, high-sidin;, and reppin’
Sweating a blade, packing a weapon, checking on my investments
Looking in both of my mirrors and my rearview
‘Cause you never know who know who, who tryna follow you
When you at a stoplight or an intersection, think
Leave a space in front of you, at least a car-length
So you can have enough room to get outta there if they squirt (SKKRRT!)
The jealous’ll love to put me in the dirt (Six feet)
Gotta be prepared for the unthinkable
Gotta stay prayed up, high alert
It’s fonky out’chere, it’s stanky like a burp
My kind the same pigmentation as gook (Yayo)
If it ain’t about no bread then it’s minute (Redundant)
These fools ain’t got no souls, mayne, they hatin’ (False suckers)
No matter what you do for fools, they ungrateful (Bustas)
Never tell what you about to do in front of a bitch
‘Cause if you fall out, she gon’ tell the streets who did the shit
Real game for a player…BIATCH!

[Hook]
Real game for a player
(Yeah, and that’s game)
Real game for a player (Hell yeah)
(Mmm-hmm, real game for a player)
Real game for a player
(Yeah, and that’s game)
Real game for a player
(Hell yeah)
For a player

[Verse 3]
I’ve been replacing the letter P with the letter Y
Yaper, yowder, you late guys
Suckers don’t wanna fade but quick to bust they gats
Instead of fighting and shaking hands like after a tennis match
The shit they doing these days, I ain’t enjoying it
Martin and Malcolm X is disappointed
My race done let ‘em down, no longer breathin’
They died for us, they died for our freedom
One of the homies got caught with some pills, I had to bail him out
I said ‘Nigga, don’t you know that’s enough money to put on a house in the South?’
He said ‘Nigga, don’t you know you hella lucky I didn’t snitch?’
I said ‘Nigga, what you mean I’m hella lucky you didn’t snitch?’
He said ‘I coulda told ‘em it was yours, I could told ‘em that you’ve been frontin’ me
Even though I still woulda went to jail, at least I woulda had some company’
I said ‘Nigga, who the fuck raised you, you lying ass son of a bitch?’
He said ‘Nigga, I’m talking shit, I’m silent as a gimp’
Real game for a player…BIATCH!
