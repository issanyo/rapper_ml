[Verse 1]
Antibiotics and narcotics
This land is ran by robots
My torpedoes, they got dreadlocks
Pockets stretched like Botox
Fresh up out the halfway
Right back to pushin' pay-pay
Got my jewelry out of layaway
My plug may be at Denny's
Micro Draco AK
Will get you out the widnay
My auntie name is Bebe
About her, I don't plidnay
Clientele and clidnout
I had in a dridnought
Honey badgers on the lookout
Turn your body to a cookout

[Chorus]
My plug met me at Denny's (at the restaurant)
My plug met me at Denny's (in the parking lot)
My plug met me at Denny's (at the restaurant)
My plug met me at Denny's (in the parking lot)
My plug met me at Denny's (at the restaurant)
My plug met me at Denny's (in the parking lot)
My plug met me at Denny's (at the restaurant)
My plug met me at Denny's (in the parking lot)

[Verse 2]
Antibiotics and narcotics (lean)
This land is run by robots (machines)
My torpedoes, they got dreadlocks (wool)
Pockets stretched like Botox (pull)
Nasal candy for the nizose (nostril)
My children need some school clothes (Costco)
Still eat Top Ramen noodles (carbs)
Processed sugar and high fructose (starch)
Might overdose on glucose (sweets)
It's cold out here, need Metamucil (streets)
That's why we clicked with our Usos (muscle)
You see the pain up in our pupils (struggle)
My rifle is a Kel-Tec (BLAOW!)
I'll bust you in your nizeck (OW!)
If you disrespizect (WOW!)
VS2's up in my Patek (BIATCH!)

[Chorus]
My plug met me at Denny's (at the restaurant)
My plug met me at Denny's (in the parking lot)
My plug met me at Denny's (at the restaurant)
My plug met me at Denny's (in the parking lot)
My plug met me at Denny's (at the restaurant)
My plug met me at Denny's (in the parking lot)
My plug met me at Denny's (at the restaurant)
My plug met me at Denny's (in the parking lot)
