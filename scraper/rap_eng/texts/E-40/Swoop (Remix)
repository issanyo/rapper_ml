[Hook: Eric Statz]
Your bitch want me to come swoop (fast)
Your bitch want me to come swoop (fast)
She want a winning ass nigga like me
Press a nigga is how they cannot take it easy like that
Your bitch want me to come swoop (fast)

[Verse 1: E-40]
She want me to swoop her, she like the way I manouvre
She say her boyfriend's a loser, she want a nigga with gouda
My bitch is bad but she cuter, got tits like she work at Hooters
She ride my dick like a scooter, and her momma is a cougar
I stay mack and [?], my niggas be rappin'
Their music be slappin', they got broads, they be gassin'
So you're savage, I'm manish, I got the block in my blood
They ain't drop to the floors, see it in a barbecue world
I don't pay for nothin' while I slide in the club
Security love me, they help me roll like the world
When I was a little one, niggas knew I was it
I used to be broke but now I'm bustin' your bitch

[Hook]
Your bitch want me to come swoop (fast)

[Verse 2: Eric Statz]
We be together, your killin' them bitches, I'm killin' them niggas
There's no one that spy her, we got it on lock girl, that's why we're together
There ain't no fussin', nor fighting, just fucking because you remember
I will cut that ass off, oh yeah yeah
I know everytime I phony
Bitch your girl she know me
Come swoop girl

[Hook]
Your bitch want me to come swoop (fast)

[Bridge: Eric Statz]
I'm the nigga, she be blowin' on my cellphone constantly
I'm the nigga, she be blowin' on my cellphone constantly
I'm the nigga, she be blowin' on my cellphone constantly
I'm the nigga, she be blowin' on my cellphone constantly

[Verse 3: Sage The Gemini]
(And they already know me S-A-G-E, huh)
I pull up like "I do not belong here"
Car loud sound like I just hit the wrong gear
I can get it what she do with a sable when you speak
It'll be like you talkin' to the wrong gear
Just watch, you gon' take the best notes
Think I'm on a swimmin' team, I just got the best stroke
I don't spend no money, thought you knew that
Windows all tinted, when you get out, I'll be like "Who that?"
Then turn 'em all, I just wanna ball
I'mma bring her back, same time as yesterday
My house kind of photo, lookin' all "Clueless"
She like "What we doin'?", I'm like "Same thing as yesterday", hey!
