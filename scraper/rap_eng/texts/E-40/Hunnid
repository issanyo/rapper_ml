[Yakki]
Turn up!
On this road to love, it's gon be so hard for me [?]
If your beauty speaks, yeah she so loud I cannot ignore
I tried to love her, but she tried to hurt me
Keep playing games, girl which one you working
Tripping you bitching, when you know I'm certain
No glove or no mitten, but I'm catchin' plays

I can make a hunnid in day (x8)

[?]
OG Kush from the Bay
Got it out the mud, I'm okay
I'm just tryin to get a grind, get a raise
I wonder why she trippin' on me
All this money, got it out the streets
All work, No play, No sleep
I'm the one that make sure that we eat
Coming late because I gotta get it
[?] bitch I don't know why you trippin'
I'm the reason that you poppin' tabs
I'm the reason for that Chanel Bag
Always mad cause I'm workin'
But yo ass want a Birkin
Every night I eat that steak and shrimp
Cause I'm not going back to Church's

On this road to love, it's gon be so hard for me [?]
If your beauty speaks, yeah she so loud I cannot ignore
I tried to love her, but she tried to hurt me
Keep playing games, girl which one you working
Tripping you bitching, when you know I'm certain
No glove or no mitten, but I'm catchin' plays

[E-40]
I can make a hunnid in a day
Not a hunnid dollars but a hunnid k (hunnid k)
Hand weighted, hell I don't need a fish scale
Flipping packs like a motherfucking cartwheel
Quadruple quadruple quadruple
This a Yacht master on my right not a Hugo
I'm a Godzilla ballin, factor from the cage
If you look me in the eye you see rage
Shoebox money I surpassed
So much cash need baseball bat bags
Got the bounty on my head I reverse the hit
Be careful who you having a a dinner with
Never know how much time you got left til' the angel of death come and take away your breath
That's why I always pray
I can make a hunnid in a day
