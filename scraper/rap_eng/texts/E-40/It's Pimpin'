It's pimpin, what.. (what is it?)

[Hook]
It's pimpin with me, what is it with you?
Bitch hit the strip and do what you do
(Pay attention to me, and stay on the track)
(I'll be right back, when I be right back)

Tryin to have a stable full of, gregarious, clear bitches
Professional wonderful ladies of leisure, merrylicious
That'll get undressed at the drop of a dime at my request
And believe that, e'rytang I tell her to do is for the best
Ho you in violation, you in the red, wait a minute ho
You mean to tell me you tryin to jump camp
After a big ol' player like me done buttered yo' bread?
You free to go, I ain't gon' tell you no mo'
I told you twice, you'll be back cause you need, pimpin in yo' life
That's how you gotta get at these broads, you gotta check 'em
Man a ho'll walk all over ya if you let 'em
I give her a Chinese name (what?) Won Gone
Then I stab out, with my ham sandwich, Fleetwood Brougham
Break a bitch, pimp shit, L-R-P's
Long Range Pimpin ho, overseas
Whites blacks filipinos, viet-ma-nese
Atlantic City, Vegas, Reno nigga please believe

She was a baby (baby) she was lame (lame)
Til I turned her out, now she's pussy trained
Pussy trained, not potty trained, but pussy trained
Pimpin you hard, you got some game!
This one of the ones, I like this knock
Who did the beat? My nigga Rik Rok
He a fool - that shit on hit
You know what this remind me of? Some of that Dr. Dre shit
Blarin, imagine that shit on blast
At the Arco station after the club, pumpin some gas

(Wait a minute, wait; hey hold up.. ba-ba-bump-bump! *car horn*
Ba-ba-bump-ah *car horn* Baby.. ay sweetie! Ay look here baby
Underdig this, ya underdig? Ay look here
You need to get with a boss, tell that day old seven to get lost
Yeah, cause all he gon' is damage you
All I wanna do is manage you)

She said - just take me out to the pimp pic-nic
I'mma put it down for you..
Represent that Sic'Wid'It
Whatever you want me to do!
She loves me (loves me) she loves me not (loves me not)
As far as family, I'm all she got (all she got)
Pimpin and panderin, handlin these hoes
Penitentiary chancin it (?) with these hoes
Checkin the track, collectin my scratch, and slammin Cadillac doors
Countin my stack, spat to them straps
Directin the mannerisms of these hoes
Ready for war, never too to', with Taylor shoes on my toes
Sickin my beotches on these rappers cause they be payin these hoes
