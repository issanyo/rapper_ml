[Chorus: DecadeZ]
Half past faded, half past burnt
Half past zooted, half past turnt
Boy, I’m whooped
Boy, I’m whooped
Boy, I’m whooped
I’m whooped

[Verse 1: E-40]
I’m havin’ my mathematics, packin’ them semi-automatics
I was born to be a savage from the cradle to the casket
I’m cut from a different fabric, not no vinyl or no plastic
I ain’t at the airport (but what?) but I’m getting to the baggage
At the outdoor shooting range is where I practice my science
Tryin’ to apply for my CCW license
The rifles I bust is for hunting wildlife and bison
The people I trust are my family, kids, and my wife
And most of you niggas fakes, see right through you suckas like Christmas wrapping tape
Open you up tryin’ to run up in my estate
Try your luck, meet your fate
Get cut down like a Wagu steak
Put some holes in your face just like a wrought iron gate
I don’t let grass grow up under my feet, I stay bustin’ patterns
I could stay like a license plate at a bar or a tavern
These bitches be on me, they like the way I finesse
The way that I carry it and the way that I dress…BIATCH!

[Chorus: DecadeZ]
Half past faded, half past burnt
Half past zooted, half past turnt
Boy, I’m whooped
Boy, I’m whooped
Boy, I’m whooped
I’m whooped

[Verse 2: B-Legit + (E-40)]
Get to feeling like aliens around me (‘round me)
Paranoid, I be on the OG (OG)
Bag underrated if you ask me (ask me)
Could put it in the can where the trash be (trash be)
Bitches love B-la, he a activist (activist)
Forever locked in with the Africans (Africans)
On the frontline with a black stick (black stick)
Military issue, get to clappin’ them (clappin’ them)
California face on a Georgia peach (Georgia peach)
Met a nigga up when I’m in the streets (in the streets)
Tryin’ to do it all, she a little freak (little freak)
Her homegirl with her, really wanna eat (wanna eat)
Watch her lick it up, she gon’ hit it up (hit it up)
Baby girl a nut, she gon’ spit it up (spit it up)
Remy in her cup, lemon in her blunt (in her blunt)
And I’ve been getting fucked up all month (BIATCH!)

[Chorus: DecadeZ + (E-40)]
Half past faded, half past burnt
Half past zooted, half past turnt
Boy, I’m whooped (Boy, I’m whooped)
Boy, I’m whooped (Boy, I’m whooped)
Boy, I’m whooped (Boy, I’m whooped)
I’m whooped (Whooped)
Boy, I’m whooped (Boy, I’m whooped)
Boy, I’m whooped (Boy, I’m whooped)
Boy, I’m whooped (Boy, I’m whooped)
I’m whooped (Whooped)
