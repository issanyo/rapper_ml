[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She don’t want commitment, she up in the club
She just want a baller to show her some love
She got you at home, tryna be faithful
And she got you at home, tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
And you’re tryna be faithful

[Verse 1: Bobby Brackins]
I love a little bit for her, that's for my last chick
Don't wanna her love her, I just want the first draft pick
Bring her to mom's world, make her a keeper
Party with a boy, got her just lacing
In the foreign Lamb, you just counting them 40s
Triple double up, let her feel for me shawty
You don't commend me, tell me why you tripping
She just wanna call and know how I'm still living
I'm dropping that tuition
And when she find a baller she probably want children
Rather kiss the fool right before I catch feelings
I'mma right that while my bitch purse stealing, bitch in the building

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She don’t want commitment, she up in the club
She just want a baller to show her some love
She got you at home, tryna be faithful
And she got you at home, tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
And you’re tryna be faithful

[Verse 2: IamSu!]
Yeah yeah, blackout
There go youngsters in the game, go and put that smack down
And she's getting extra weather, yeah it's slippery now
Hickory dickory dock then I'll be dicking her down
Telling me slow this shit down, I can't stop
I got the world in my hands, I can't drop
And when I got her ass in my hands, it feels good
Girl, if she got a man, she still would
I call this when you getting money then you become a target
I come from the bottom and I ain't forget where I started
Ghetto bitch and go dumb, retarded
Realise real, niggas you real lethargic

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She don’t want commitment, she up in the club
She just want a baller to show her some love
She got you at home, tryna be faithful
And she got you at home, tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
And you’re tryna be faithful

[Verse 3: Ty Dolla $ign]
Built tough in the ride, big budget like a movie
Keep your bitch by your side cause them hoes be choosey
Show what a time of a life, you should already know it
These girls quick to lie, that’s why you can’t trust these hoes
She told me she want me
And you call her, you’re only
Plus she fucked the homie
And she ride like a pony

[Hook: Ty Dolla $ign]
She don’t want commitment, she up in the club
She just want a baller to show her some love
She got you at home, tryna be faithful
And she got you at home, tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
Tryna be faithful
And she got you at home
And you’re tryna be faithful
