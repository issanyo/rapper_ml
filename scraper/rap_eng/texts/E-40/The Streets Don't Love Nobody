[Chorus:]
Better stop dat talkin
Niggas roun here don’t do dat often
Like a rojo, like d popo (pop!)
In d four four in all black ready to go
Man d streetz don’t love nobody (nobody)[x3]

[Verse 1:]
Me an ma raccoons will put hands on you an yo pitbulls
When this was old school,but still he was talkin shit to a bunch a younger fools
One a d young fools laughed an said you old enough to be ma dad
The old schooler went bad got mad an pulled out a gap
(A gap?) Yea quadruple OG terminology
Hiitin wid d israel oozin, smacked him and called him Suzie
Now he a ugly nigga, now he ain’t no more cutie
The OG a killer, hitter, jus got out on Tuesday
Neva know who heavy duty in d streets pushin weight
Have yo head put on a stick, an brought back on a plate
D streets don’t love nobody, but everybody love d streets
I ain’t stuntin sloppy, tryna impress these freaks
Rats, tramps, strippers, hoes
Sluts, ducks, diggin fo’ gold
I ain’t captain save a hoe, no not hardly
She don’t wanna fuck me she wanna fuck ma harley
(Bitch!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
We got d juice in d hood, so we talk alot
While d wilks lick they lips, lamb chops
Big homey dippin in there pocket too
He say this some oldG shit but thats a dope thing Moove
Man d streetz don’t love nobody, stay strapped I ain’t fightin nobody
Nigga you hit d wrong person when aight
Nigga bulets ain’t got no nine
It will put yo guns up, ‘specially when yo ones up
Nigga stay strapped, case a fuck nigga run up
Used to be da front man now we got all day
Pick d youngster often, then shot him on d freeway
Damn, down goes another one, heard he had it comin don’t know why they kill him, son
Ping pong in d hood, retaliation, young kids bust yo head fo’ a reputation

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You could to be bangin fo’ life, it don’t matter
A young nigga who duggin want his pockets lookin fatter
Betta watch d lil brother lookin like a chain snatcher
You’d came from d hood but he still gettin attch yah
When am all paying mamas loan lil brother want di drama
Lil man’s comming for you hope you stand with the lama
Shoulda listen to you mama, she told you about dem dudes
All em cars, all em bitch, all em richies ain’t cool
I know you fuck wid who you roll wid, Dude I can’t believe you roll wid
Dude I told you he told dude I’m sorry that’s d wrong move
Real niggas ova here that are really moved
He said he wack them with the mower thats the life he choose
Thought it was a game till I seen dat boy on d move
Told you ain’t no love ova here don’t get it confused
Thought it was a game till I seen dat boy on d news
Told you ain’t no love ova here don’t get it confused

[Chorus]
