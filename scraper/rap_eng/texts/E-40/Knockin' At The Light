[Chorus: Stresmatic]
I heard the story from another nigga (What that nigga was sayin'?)
This nigga said y'all got into it with some niggas that ain't even from over here
Over some dumb shit
Seen them same niggas later, and got to knockin' at the light
Them niggas got to knockin' at the light
Them niggas got to knockin' at the light
(*Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot*)
Them niggas got to knockin' at the light
Them niggas got to knockin' at the light
(*Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot*)

[Verse 1: E-40]
They don't rap, but he fuck with 40s and 50s
They block the riches in they city, they heavy about their fetti
They on (They on), got a cold operation
Niggas be hating on them players, bitches love 'em, they hella popular and known (And known)
Sliding Audis and 'Raris, Caddies, Benzes and Maseratis
They active, bruh, they got bodies, they ain't playin'
No games with you suckers, against they mans (Against they mans)
Pull up in the bucket and get to sprayin' (Get to sprayin')
Open up a can (Can), or get him up out the way
Send him on his way (On his way)
Slid up on the side with the SK (SK)
Mama'n'em still cryin' to this very day (Very day)

[Chorus: Stresmatic & (E-40)]
I heard the story from another nigga (What that nigga was sayin'?)

[Verse 2: E-40]
Cleaning they guns and smoking sherbert
Plotting out they plot block
Partner that's dead, they cousin, at the light they pop
They having they bread, they banked up like the enemy (Enemy)
The nigga that's dead, cousins outta Tennessee (Tennessee)
They rode in on the Greyhound, they hella hurtin', what have you
Ready to work, go to battle, ready to beef like some cattle, ready to murk
Knock something down, do dirt, do they homework
Spin a bitch nigga around, pop him in his shirt

[Chorus: Stresmatic & (E-40)]
Them niggas got to knockin' at the light (At the light)
Them niggas got to knockin' at the light

[Verse 3: E-40]
Surgical gloves and ski mask
Veterans, not green like the grass
Known gunners where they from, been playing with drum
Gotta an auntie that know where the shooter's baby mama stay
Over there by Safeway in them Section 8 houses
That's where she stay, say
Anybody can be found, use your brain (Use your brain)
Shit, look how they found Hussein (Hussein)
A hole in the Middle East, gotta be creased (Creased)
That's all it takes to get deceased
Never who know who mayne, it's a small planet (Small planet)
When there's funk, what you do? Handle it (Handle it)
When you don't? Don't panic
Don't be no punk, damage, UH
Lives lost over lack of discussions
Consequences and repercussions (Repercussions)
UH, it's on on sight
Got on 'em, started knockin' at the light
(*Doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot-doot*)
