[Intro: Payroll Giovanni]
Yeah
You know
There come a point in life, where you just gotta get money
Block all that bullshit (BYLUG)
You just gotta get ya mail long
Only hustlas gonna relate tho
Detroit to the bay (come on)
Four one

[Verse 1: Payroll Giovanni]
Fuck these bitches nigga get yo paper
I grew up in the trenches with dope fiend neighbors
Now it’s big cribs bitch, I got acres
She diggin’ how I live but I can’t save her
Came up off dropping pounds like weight trainers
I’m tryna get rich, nigga fuck being famous
Fully loaded coupe, naw this ain’t no basic
Presi on my wrist, naw this ain’t no stainless
We wrap up work then ship that shit
Do a bunch a dirt then forget that shit
Thousand dollar shirt, let me get that bitch
Cash it out and didn't see if I can fit that shit
I run with movers and shakers, you losers is waiters
I smell like money, you should get used to this fragrance
I was young coppin’ from work niggas well known
Just a lil’ nigga trying to get my mail long

[Hook: Payroll Giovanni]
It’s like this, it’s like that
Before you ball, young niggas stack (stack yo paper)
It’s like this, it’s like that
Whatever I spend I’m gonna get it all back
I’m tryna get my mail long
I’m tryna get my mail long
I’m tryna get my mail long
I’m tryna get my mail long
I’m tryna get my mail long
I’m tryna get my mail long

[Verse 2: E-40]
If you ain’t tryna get yo mail long, then get the hell on
He who has without sin throw the first stone
My music is Studio Ton, Too $hort, The Click, Mike Mosley, and Sam Bosley
Shoutout to mechanics
Real shit, thought it wasn’t?
Detroit and the bay is cousins
Out here where we stay, they hustlin’
The block and the digi-beam, they huggin'
Stack yo paper man, fuck blowin’ a check
Buy a car lot, dispensary, or a fourplex
Pack a good Glock for the enemy, extra clips
Tote a chinop that will take the head off a T-Rex
I love money more than I love sex
I gotta Patek Phillipe and a Rolex
The more I make, make want some more scratch
Doughboyz Cashout and Cardo on the slap
BITCH!!

It’s like this, it’s like that

I’m tryna get my mail long
I’m tryna get my mail long
I’m tryna get my mail long
I’m tryna get my mail long
I’m tryna get my mail long
