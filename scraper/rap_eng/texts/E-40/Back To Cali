Back To Cali, back to Cali, Back to Cali

[Hook]
I'm thinkin' bout goin' back to Cali for the pack
I'm thinkin' bout standin' in the trap
I'm thinkin' bout goin' back to Cali for the pack
I'm thinkin' bout standin' in the trap
I'm thinkin' bout goin' back to Cali for the pack
I'm thinkin' bout standin' in the trap
I'm thinkin' bout goin' back to Cali for the pack

Drop the ticket watch em pull up back to back

[Verse 1]
I'm thinkin' bout standin' in the trap with the strap
First nigga pull up I'ma blow off his cap
Jack and juugin' yeah we finesse and cap
Scout up on a mill ticket like I'm cap
I'm thinkin' bout goin' back to Cali and the Bay
Givenchy's on my hoe ain't no Ballys on me
I only take cameos in MIA
Open the phantom door with Ace of Spades
Hop out with this calico in your face
Ain't gon go back and forth, ain't gon' debate it
I'm thinkin' bout droppin' the ticket some more
Snatch a big mouth bass out Ricki Lake
Filet the fish and put the scale on your plate
My stupid wrist I probably doubled the weight

Got the molly bricks and doubled up in weight
Got the molly bricks and doubled up in your state

[Verse 2: E:40]
Grittin' flip a chicken
Listen listen all my niggas winnin'
Ballin', Jordan Scotty Pippen
Visitin', visitin', folks up in the prison
Often often spinach on my plate
Coughin' til my lounges  break
Walkin', pokin' out my chest
Talkin' hella shit cause I'm rich
California in the land of karma
With a arm of piss and go through body armor and a
Simple drama get you killed for commas with the
Roll with tens big choppas, llamas
Air it out don't give a care about
Any motherfucker hatin' on my yaper route
Fakers doubt, tryna' figure it out
Clientele and clout I got it in the drought
