[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Never been no one to waste time
Beat that beat up like a drummer on a bass line
Lil' momma tryna hit me with the waistline
She don't see I got my lady on FaceTime
I'm unashamed, can't stop that
You feelin' like a hater, stop that
They told me, "Hold up 'fore you drop that"
I'ma do it, pull the top back
'06, top down
Four fours, block now
I'ma do me, let the critics go on talk now
Right hand don't even know what the left hand doin'
How I'm gon' be worried 'bout what the next man doin'?

[Hook: Drew Allen]
Like I'm in the coupe and I'm too gone
Headed to the sky where I'm gon' go
They throwin' shade but it's cool though
I'ma do me and we on the same team
Yeah, watch how I'm doin' me
I can't do you, 'cause I'm doin' me
Yeah, I know they feel how I'm doin' me
But they gon' get a thrill how I'm doin' me

[Verse 2: E-40]
They call me E-40 but not the Sigma brush
Got my name from drinkin' 40's, used to rush
Cars cookin', cookin' them jelly jars
Yeah you a Jedi charge it up for a hover ride
Now I'm getting microphone profit
Look like I got sandbags in my pocket
Baby on my boots but it's too late
She hungry to her I look like a plate
Let me be straight up
You need to get your weight up
Stop worryin' about the next put your hate up
When my money was low I stayed high
With my chin in the sky, do or die

[Hook: Drew Allen]
Like I'm in the coupe and I'm too gone
Headed to the sky where I'm gon' go
They throwin' shade but it's cool though
I'ma do me and we on the same team
Yeah, watch how I'm doin' me
I can't do you, 'cause I'm doin' me
Yeah, I know they feel how I'm doin' me
But they gon' get a thrill how I'm doin' me

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
They hopin' I keep it cookin' and keep it poppin'
The studio, the kitchen
We mixin' up the product
Got a lot of haters, couple critics, and a stalker
Me and God be talkin', He told me not to bother
I got a master plan from the Master
So let 'em talk about me while I'm lookin' crazy dancin'
My clothes don't match and my holes got a pants
Wait, I think I may have said it backwards
It's cool though, how you do that there?
Actin' like nobody know what you do back there
I hear that hate a mile away, I notice you back there
I ain't dwellin' on it, I ain't tryna do that there

[Hook: Drew Allen]
Like I'm in the coupe and I'm too gone
Headed to the sky where I'm gon' go
They throwin' shade but it's cool though
I'ma do me and we on the same team
Yeah, watch how I'm doin' me
I can't do you, 'cause I'm doin' me
Yeah, I know they feel how I'm doin' me
But they gon' get a thrill how I'm doin' me

[Outro: Drew Allen]
I can't do it like you, no, no
Yeah, 'cause I'm doin' me
