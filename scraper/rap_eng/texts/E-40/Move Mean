[Chorus]
Move mean, move mean, move mean(X4)
Ugh

[Verse 1]
He was from richmond one of the sickest places in the bay
Nah he was from oakland, fresco, berkley round that wack
Over there by delagram, nah over there by ashmond
Why did they find his body in fairfield, don’t ask me
A neighbourhood mvp, programmed to go
But everybody in the bay knew he had it comin though
His mama was a hoe his daddy on blow
Neva went to church so he neva had a soul
But this is just an example of how tha shit go
But that’s during sacramento, stacked in that Tracy Pennell Pittsburgh
Anne hack in the white house
Northern california west coast to the death
They call me 40 water, holy water on my chest
From the hillside to crest they say my city is a mess
One minute the babies born, next minute he laid to rest
Law enforcement under staffed we put the police to the test
A nigga die with two thumpers on him first time he wore a vest
That’s why

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I’m out here right where the knocks at
Got the 40 Glock, cocked in my jock strap
Tinted windows round here, betta park that
I don’t play a put one in ya hard hat
I’m two slick diggs quick to move
When I get in a nigga’s ass I got shit to do
Playa slash coach I call the shots
And just like the roach I know all the spots
I’m all in the attic and under the house
I’ll wake ya ass up with a gun in ya mouth
I switch cabs, cars and buses
Might work a neck brace or borrow some crutches
I come through limpin, hoppin and bustin
Can’t find who I’m lookin for I’m poppin his cousin
Shit gettin funky I’m the talk a the town
Hits anything movin and knockin it down

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Philmore rich what up 40 yeah
Bang bang motherfucker this is what it is
Reputation alone came by the hundred years
Feds say we selling dope these niggas tellin jokes
I’m a star niggas watch me through a telescope
Rap shit is easy shoot it like a free throw
Opportunity knocking I’m watchin through the peep hole
Product a the projects, popeye and the pirates
I was only 9 introduced to the process
Money being made that’s why they hate me
In the lab cooking looking like a bakery
Fat nigga clean, lookin like a millions
Good with my words give a bitch a good feelin
Philmore legend speak to em like a reverend
Try’na see a meal before a nigga go to heaven
3 storey is the game street cred the machine
I’m a frisco ball so young dude move mean

[Chorus]
