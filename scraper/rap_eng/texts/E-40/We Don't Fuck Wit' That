[Verse 1: B-Legit]
Ya see I'm nuthin' but a player, call me "Bad News Bear"
And everywhere a nigga go you know I check a hoe there
And on my second time through, you know how I do
I get some head, eat some eggs and I'm gone by 2
I got soundcheck bitch, the shows is at 6
So if you coming in, bring your woman-friends
I got a few dogs posted at my telly
D-Shot, Tap, Young Mugz and Celly
And we gon' try to tear the fuckin' roof off something
We was backstage smokin' and some hoes was thumpin'
A bitch got mad 'cause she didn't get chose
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe
Your nigga went wild when he first seen that
Pulled out a sack and rolled one fat
We was back to the tell' 'cause we bail on them boys in blue
Fuckin' wit this Click crew
And the worst thing can happen when your out of the state
They lock a nigga down and take away his dank
It makes me can't thank, I gets nervous and sick
Fiendin' for a motherfuckin' fix

[Chorus 2X: E-40]
A smokin' we will go
Puffin' on indo
So put that bammer back
'Cause we don't fuck wit' that

[Verse 2]
I left Minnesota 'cause the spot was tired
Hit Louisville and the spot was fire
Old school sittin' on straight-laced kicks
Reminding me of 1986
Fools burnin' rubber, fuck some switches
Niggas from the Bay smoke it up on bitches
Filas on the gas, smash and yolk
Hoes passin' out 'cause there's too much smoke
Gary, Indiana, bitch gone in a minute
I let you hit my weed and you straight up shitted
In your draws, Guess jeans and all
And then you had nerve to give E a call
But he called back and wasn't fuckin' wit you
'Cause hoes down South know good voodoo
Fuck around and have your ass sprung like Eddie
Period blood mixed in your spaghetti
And if I could I would roll a vega
From Hillside, Cali to the Get Low Playaz
You niggas light it for me and I'm pass it to Quinn
And let it out when you get to ten

[Chorus 2X: E-40]
A ethyl we will go
Drankin' on some mo'
So put that weak shit back
'Cause we don't fuck wit' that

[Verse 3]
I'm finally hittin' Cali after three weeks gone
Done ran out of bomb and I'm glad to be home
Now who on my phone, Dante or Brew?
I'll be there in a minute to do what we do
See, it's a tree that we got, 'cause we gon' smoke
And blow big dope from young body and know
And I can't give a fuck if you're drunk off swamp
I'mma give you a 5 we gon' light the twamp
Hit to the doobie, throw the shit in the street
Somethin' for the homies that be restin' in peace
The shit won't cease 'til I see D
I know my homie got a fat blunt for me
Pineapple juice, Malibu Rum
151 get your dickhead numb
When it gets like that, you know I gots to fuck
Or maybe kickback and get my dickhead sucked
I won't ask for much, just ass and guts
And brand new speakers for my old-school Cut
A big fat sack of that doja
So I can get smokin' like I'm 'posed to

[Chorus: E-40]
Hoe-hoppin we will go
Smokin' on indo
So put that bammer back
'Cause we don't fuck wit' that
Ethyl we will go
Drankin' on some mo'
So put that weak shit back
'Cause, uh, we don't fuck wit' that, nigga
