[Chorus: Rick Rock]
I’ve been around the world and back again
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
Traveled a lot, made some friends, made some ends
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)

[Verse 1: E-40]
UH, I love the Bay, Northern California, Silicon Valley
Where they rowdy and ratchet, OG’s and the youngsters is active
‘Bout that action, speaks louder than words
Ambulance, ghetto birds
Inner city living, Alcatraz and San Quentin
Pimps, gangsters, hustlers, and macks—turf dirt
Boppers and rippers, ghetto divas with nice figures
Women with they own money, credit cards, cars, and cash
Know how to get out and get it, refuse to sit on their ass
Don’t nothin’ come to a sleeper but a nightmare
I’m from Magazine Street, and I’m a California Bear
The Bay, Marine World Africa USA
Connected to Dan Foley Park in the Valley J, BIATCH!

[Chorus: Rick Rock]
I’ve been around the world and back again
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
Traveled a lot, made some friends, made some ends
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)

[Interlude]
415, they’re in the house (Make some noise)
Yeah, make some noise
7-0-Sav, you’re in the house (Make some noise)
Yeah, make some noise
510, you’re in the house (Make some noise)
Yeah, make some noise
650, you’re in the house (Make some noise)
Yeah, make some noise

[Verse 2: Rick Rock]
Yeah, yeah, from the I-80 to the 580
On the West Coast seas, I’ma drift, baby
I’m a bridge kid, I’m a poster child
From where the cars go in circles, sideshow
I remember back when everybody wanted to see the best beatbox from me, Mike Reid, or Terry Tee
I remember back when everybody wanted to see the breakdance group: GBC or UBC
The more things change, the more they stay same (Yep)
Still drunk, tailgaiting to the Raiders game
Out the window, on the freeway at a beezy, mayne
Then I hit the toll booth and can’t find no change
I seen Too $hort on Home Turf yesterday
Well, not yesterday, but like yesterday
They working on the Bay Bridge, I’ma take the Golden Gate
Yeah, I love the Bay

[Chorus: Rick Rock]
I’ve been around the world and back again
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
Traveled a lot, made some friends, made some ends
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
I love the Bay (I love the Bay)
Yep, I love the Bay

[Outro]
Northern Cali in the house
Is Northern Cali in the house? (Yeah)
Is Northern Cali in the house?
(It’s just too many spots out here to name, mayne)
(Too many to name) Is Northern Cali in the house?
(So I’ma do it like this…)
Everybody up top, make some noise (Make some noise)
Everybody on the top, make some noise (Make some noise)
Everybody in the buildin’, make some noise (Make some noise)
Everybody in the house, make some noise
(Rick Rock, bring the beat back)
