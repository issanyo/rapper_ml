[Chorus]
All up n ya ear, rockin’ like bamboo
Rockin’ like, rockin’ like, bamboo
All up n ya ear, rockin’ like bamboo
Rockin’ like, rockin’ like, bamboo
Bam bam bamboo

[Verse 1]
Ughhh, the beat is excruciating
You're liable to find me up in an old school on Zeniths or Daytons
Scooting and skating, beating and quaking, waking up the ave
With a yellow bone the same complexion as a cab
Money on my agenda ever since I came out the placenta
Blowing and puffing on this indica
I’m a movie, I’m a cinema, motion picture go figure. 7 figure nigaa
Just because I rap, don’t think I won’t squeeze the trigga’
Not a barber but I pack an extra clippa’
Put you in your place
Send a couple of crash dummy, open up your face
I’m addicted to this fast money rushing like a race
Fuckin’ around with the baking soda not that toothpaste
Imma do it till its doomsday, till the day I’m sentenced
In the meantime in between time, speakin' money into existence
Speakin' money into existence, talking it up
Man you gone live a long time, that’s what’s up

[Chorus]
All up n ya ear, rockin’ like bamboo
Rockin’ like, rockin’ like, bamboo
All up n ya ear, rockin’ like bamboo
Rockin’ like, rockin’ like, bamboo
Bam bam bamboo (bamboo)
Bam bam bamboo (bamboo)
Bam bam bamboo (bamboo)
Bam bam bamboo, yeah
Bam bam bamboo
Bam bam bamboo
Bam bam bamboo (bamboo)
Bam bam bamboo yeah

[Verse 2]
Ugghh
First off, we the opposite of soft
We love to get twisted like fingers crossed
We stay smoking like bad exhaust
Raculini?, Zucchini, aviation, vegetation
Broken English, distinguish E40’s translation
Protection my weapon of choice, magical
Walther ppq m2, tactical
I like guns with bolt action, like mossberg
So intruders, they’ll get what they deserve
Everybody in my platoon in a tycoon for sure
Trips to Jamaica, vacation buy up the top floor
I got ears, I be spitting a minute? bitch. Wordsmith got a cold sales pitch
I can sell paper to a tree, water to the sea, sea snow to Tahoe, chips to Bellagio
Fuckin Halle Berry’s on my bucket list, I’ll stick my tongue in her pussy lips

[Chorus]
All up n ya ear, rockin’ like bamboo
Rockin’ like, rockin’ like, bamboo
All up n ya ear, rockin’ like bamboo
Rockin’ like, rockin’ like, bamboo
Bam bam bamboo (bamboo)
Bam bam bamboo (bamboo)
Bam bam bamboo (bamboo)
Bam bam bamboo, yeah
Bam bam bamboo
Bam bam bamboo
Bam bam bamboo (bamboo)
Bam bam bamboo, yeah

[Verse 3]
Waking’ em up, waking’ em up
Waking’ em up, waking’ em up
Waking’ em up, waking’ em up
All up in their ear like, bamboo
Bamboo(bamboo) Bamboo(bamboo)
Bamboo(bamboo) Bamboo(bamboo)
Bamboo(bamboo) Bamboo(bamboo)
Bamboo(bamboo) Bamboo(bamboo)
Bitch
Yeah
Yeah
