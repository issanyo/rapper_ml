[Hook: TK Kravitz]
I just got paid, yeah
Got a whole lot of money on my hustle
Cause I grind everyday, yeah
Now it's time to get paid, yeah

[Verse 1: Kirko Bangz]
Whether hitting a nigga pimping or strip with a bitch
Whether you working 9 to 5 or you get benefits
Ain't nothing like that new money to get you motivated
I ain't a farmer, but my crops hella cultivated
That shit feel like heaven when that deposit drop
But if the shit hit late, a nigga heart stop
My hustle's 24/7, boy, you part time
Fuck that pussy, I gotta hustle, I don't want none

[Hook: TK Kravitz]
I just got paid, yeah
Got a whole lot of money on my hustle
Cause I grind everyday, yeah
Now it's time to get paid, yeah
I just got paid, my nigga got paid
Sit back, count money in the safe
I'm paid, I just got paid
Young nigga got paid, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2: E-40]
Got a mama I made it t-shirt on, winning
My diamond medallion look like it got a battery pack up in it
Getting paper is a ritual
I just got paid, just got a bag, just got my issue
Pussy I'm up for a rainy night
That's what my uncle said, I said fly a kite
I don't know when they gon' come and get me so I'm balling
Baby mama ain't finna spend my money with the next nigga while I'm in a coffin
So I'mma live it up to the utmost
Celebrate, make a toast
Live everyday like there ain't another day, won't hesitate
Keeping it lit like a birthday cake, me and my partners, we medicate
Moving a block like Tetris
Whenever I do something, I gotta do it big like Texas
Candy paint, chop' blades
That's how you know a player paid

[Hook: TK Kravitz]
I just got paid, yeah
Got a whole lot of money on my hustle
Cause I grind everyday, yeah
Now it's time to get paid, yeah
I just got paid, my nigga got paid
Sit back, count money in the safe
I'm paid, I just got paid
Young nigga got paid, yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 3: Kirko Bangz]
Feeling like I just hit the lottery
I'm done being humble, fuck all the modesty
I ain't worried 'bout your chick, that's how I gotta be
I be a fool if she get a check outta me
Just got paid, buy the whole thing
Today I feel en-Tidal, that's a Hov thing
I hate to pull a Lauren London, on my old thing
But I'm going new new, with these 4 chains
New phone, bitch who is you?
Just got paid, now they miss you
She asked me did I hit her best friend last week
Call that nigga winter fresh cause I meant too
Been working all week but I'm paid now
3 stacks make 'em girls say hey ya
I told my migo all week, I want that take off
But now I'm walking on green like I play golf

[Hook: TK Kravitz]
I just got paid, yeah
Got a whole lot of money on my hustle
Cause I grind everyday, yeah
Now it's time to get paid, yeah
I just got paid, my nigga got paid
Sit back, count  money in the safe
I'm paid, I just got paid
Young nigga got paid, yeah yeah yeah
I just got paid, yeah
Got a whole lot of money on my hustle
Cause I grind everyday, yeah
Now it's time to get paid, yeah
