[Intro]
Little bad ass Billy
Billy Bad Ass

[Verse 1]
I knew a boy named Billy that he thought he was cool
Thought he was too damn cool to take his ass to school
But little did he know, it would have paid in the end
He had to be the class clown to keep up with his friends
At least he thought they was his friends -- he thought they was down
Til when it came down to it, they turned the nina around
Billy Bad Ass couldn't go out like a punk
Everywhere he went, he had his strap in his trunk
Strapped, tapped, ready to pump
Drove a old-school Chevy with tremendous bump
He had a name in the dope game
Thought it was the only way that he could claim his fame
He was down for me, he'd be down for you
Down for everyone in his whole crew
His mind kind of lagged as far as being black
We already got enough folks on our backs
The po-pos, the white folks
Every other race, mayne -- it ain't no joke
He seemed to be real, he thought his game was true
All you had to say was boo and he would act a fool

[Hook]
Billy Bad Ass
He thought he had game
But he was lame
He was lame to the game

Billy Bad Ass
He thought he had game
But he was lame
He was hella lame

[Verse 2]
I remember the days when the party was on
If it wasn't a party, he would make it go on
He didn't give a damn if the party was buck
He'd come to the thing doing that old-school stunt
That jealous thing, it never failed, you see
Instead of sticking together, he made it a gangster party
He'd seen someone that owed him years ago
Bust some undercover things and niggas thought it was over
I thought to myself, why it gotta be like this?
By the end of my thought, he was hella pissed
Instead of letting it go, as far as dude being black
He was full of liquor and his senses hella lagged
Billy wasn't satisfied unless he cleared his name
A gangsta-ass nigga, thought he had game but he was lame
Next thing you know, I heard a pop goes the weasel
Bad Ass Billy sold his bad ass soul

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Billy didn't believe that that be this greasy
And to kill a black brother was way too easy
He made it easy on the po-pos -- that's another dead nigga
From a fool showing his teeth and quick to pull the trigger
He had to learn the hard way, now he's long behind bars
Reminiscing and feeling dumb for some damn murder charge
Think twice before you air; black folks, stay strong
Let's stick together and come up or it won't be long
Until we end our own race, and that's by selling our soul
Killing our brothers and sisters just to have control
We must wake up or we'll never see the light
We have our freedom so we don't have to fight
We don't have to worry about the KKK
They stay out blacks' way so we can make their day
They love to read in the paper of blacks killing blacks
All I'm saying to my brothers and sisters is:
"Be black and stay black"

[Hook]
