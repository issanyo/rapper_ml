Wolf tickets (repeated in background)

[Intro: Kaveo]
Yeah, game goes on, nigga
And it ain't no myth for the nigga fifth
C-L-I-C-K shit up in this house bitch for rich
I was told it's a few hams out there sellin' them wolf tickets
Like they gold, tryin' to be bold
So we here to buy a few
Cash 'em in, check a chin
'Cause hogs play to win
So if you do a lot of barkin', can't walk that walk
Take two steps back and look at yourself
Before you wind up in that chalk, nigga

[D-Shot]
17 from a broken down hood with no dreams
The only thing I knew was to form a fat team
The Hillside, just a small part of the city
Where poppin' ass gangstas flossin' like me
See I rap, but what I spit gets straight real
I serve no wolf tickets, nigga, I will kill
Any motherfucker that step within my boundary
When you fuck with me, you fuck with my family

[B-Legit]
Motherfuckers talk hard, but never hit the yard
When they car gets snatched, lil' ol batch
We can knuckle up, take it to the blind
Mainline livin' got me diggin, tryin not to catch no time
They got me locked down 'cause I made the dump
17 gettin' off, niggas bringin' funk
And ain't no punk from the start
With no love and no heart
So nigga you can sing the part

[Chorus 2X: T-Pup]
Why is they barkin', knowin they know
Talkin' that irrelevant, fat mouth'n fa sho
And since it ain't no tellin what Jack told Helen
What the hell is they sellin'?
(B-Legit: Wolf Tickets)

[E-40]
Haters, come out and play-yay
And I'll be waitin' with my Chinese AK-yay
But you can't have female dog bitch in your joints
Going all up out your way just to get them brownie points
First one to wolf that shit, first one to bone and scat like cats
Just not wannabe hard hoe ass niggas run in packs
Hatin' on a slusha; just 'cause he heard that
I was thinking about doin' me a Testarossa this summer

[Suga-T]
Yeah, wolf tickets is some silly tricks tryin' to be the shit
Comin' with that sicky-sing sing stupid ass shit
Soul Train's about to pay me doe
So I can scat from Vallejo to the iggity-iggity O, ugh
It's a gang of fools wolfin' tryin to get in for free
Sprinkle Me, you see me, Suga-T, ugh
Might wanna preciate some real shit, spiggity spit
But now fools be straight wolfin' it

[Chorus]

[B-Legit]
I hate the transformin', bustas in disguise
Don't really know what the fuck is between they thighs
To my surprise you've been sleepin' with the enemy
And at the same time drinkin' on gin with me
I cut you loose, wasn't fuckin with the extra luggage
90-somethin and you just now gettin' published
But you wolfin' to the wrong cat
I got the hog on my back and body bleeders in my millimeter

[E-40]
A thir-a thirteen hundred block Magazine
40 cookin' cola, A-1, Ice Cream
Packages stuffed pineapple, yola, and greens
Had a basement full of choppers and triple beams
In order to spit this sort of shit you gotta know it
Seen it, did it, lived it, been in it
No more 7-11 turf burrito chimmy chommas
Now we some timers, regular customers at Benihana's

[Chorus]

[Outro: Kaveo]
Ha, ha, yeah I tried to told ya falsified ass niggas
That it's goin' down, comin' up out that V-town
You see, funk is somethin' only a chosen few stand tall through
But as you can see we pull hoe cards
For them ho-harborin', playa hatin'
Mad at the world 'cause the game is passin' them by
Type naggas that want to be hard
So accept game and stop, look and listen
And quit lyin' to kick it
And cease on the motherfuckin' wolf tickets, you know!!!!!!

[Chorus 4X]
Why is they barkin'?
Why is they wolfin'?
