[Verse 1: E-40]
Mack game, let me explain the fundamentals
Charge a bitch like incidentals
Put the peas up in the pot without the lentils
When it come to getting paper, I’m low-key instrumental
You bound to find me up in an Avis mini-van rental
Player wanna lock this dog up in a kennel
Hustle hard, never gentle
My life is a movie, it’s action-filled, it’s suspenseful
Play to win, never play to lose, I refuse
Kids gotta eat, need some school shoes
Can’t spend my cop money, gotta cop
Gotta pay my lawyer in case I get popped
Stapler in my Under Armour boxer briefs
We don’t play for give, bitch, we play for keeps
When it come to getting gouda, nigga, I’m a beast
Bring it to your door like Uber Eats

[Chorus: E-40]
I know how the streets work
Residue on my T-shirt
Hatin’ ass niggas be disgruntled
I’m sitting up counting this paper, paper
I’m getting carpal tunnel
I know how the streets work
Residue on my T-shirt
Hatin’ ass niggas be disgruntled
I’m sitting up counting this paper, paper
I’m getting carpal tunnel, carpal tunnel

[Verse 2: B-Legit]
Took her to the strip club, dropped her off
Gotta watch her, though, ‘cause she sell soft
Met her off Smirnoff, Red Bull
Like it in her gut with her hair pulled
B-la fuck around, like to smoke weed
Bunch of purple shit and palm leaf
140 acres, all trees
Carpal tunnel, nigga, when we off these
I don’t think they know, I’m the one to count
Pitcher from the block tryna strike me out
Pack turned down, called to psyche me out
Trips out of town then they wipe me out
Sick Wid it, my nigga, we follow no law
G-string, little bling, nigga, no bra
Counting hella dough, hella cole slaw
She wake me in the morning, she be old flow

[Chorus: E-40]
I know how the streets work
Residue on my T-shirt
Hatin’ ass niggas be disgruntled
I’m sitting up counting this paper, paper
I’m getting carpal tunnel
I know how the streets work
Residue on my T-shirt
Hatin’ ass niggas be disgruntled
I’m sitting up counting this paper, paper
I’m getting carpal tunnel, carpal tunnel

[Verse 3: E-40 + B-Legit]
Block jumpin’ like a trampoline
Nigga gotta move mean
They smirkish and they lurkin’ and they plot and scheme
They strung out on that crystal and promethazine
Be careful who talkin’ ‘round, watch your speech
Put a contract on my head, it’s gon’ get breeched
Reverse the bounty, turn the hit around
I know all the ones on your soil that’s really getting down
Yeah, bet your money on a rollercoaster
Nigga livin’ good ‘til the wanted poster
Then it’s retreat up out the streets
Different city every week, all bunch of suites
And beware of the paper trail
Never use your debit, nigga, they could tell
Have you shut down in a cell
Hoping you’ll snitch, won’t even tell

[Chorus: E-40]
I know how the streets work
Residue on my T-shirt
Hatin’ ass niggas be disgruntled
I’m sitting up counting this paper, paper
I’m getting carpal tunnel
I know how the streets work
Residue on my T-shirt
Hatin’ ass niggas be disgruntled
I’m sitting up counting this paper, paper
I’m getting carpal tunnel, carpal tunnel
