What's up, fool? I got like 3 bucks on the Rossi
Let's get perved
Oh, is that what you really wanna do?
(Ay, don't y’all forget the ice)
Fuck it, let’s go take it to the next
Somebody gotta go fetch that shit, though
Oh, no need to fear, D-Shot’s on his way here
(“Top of the line wine, Carlo Rossi”)
Man, I hope he bring enough
You know muthafuckas be drinking jugs and jugs of that shit
We can have like a contest
Oh, here he come now
