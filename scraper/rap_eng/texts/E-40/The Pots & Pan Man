[Verse 1]
Pots and pans, thugged out
Even in the church house on a Sunday
Ice up in my mouth, my grill look like an ice tray
Everything designer, customize fitted
Authentic material, cut and so knitted
Upper body flooded, water around my neck
Half an M it cost me for the whole set
Still wet behind the ears, ears wet
Living my second childhood, young vet
Bitch, I ain't ever wrong, I stay correct
Still got money in the streets from '88 that I need to go collect
I'll bust my TEC if I have to protect my well-being
I am an animal, not a human being
Color me a hustler, something that you ain't
I move around, paint the town, go hard in the paint

[Chorus]
This an AP on my wrist, not a wristband
Taking risks in the kitchen, pepper in my hand
I turn a rack into a hundred bands
The goon with the spoon, the Pots and Pan Man (pots and pans)
This an AP on my wrist, not a wristband
Taking risks in the kitchen, pepper in my hand
I turn a rack into a hundred bands
The goon with the spoon, the Pots and Pan Man (pots and pans)

[Verse 2]
A champion in these streets when I was on the tar
Popular in my region, trench star
Triple beam boy, jelly jar
You suckers is bitches, body suits, leotard
Shout out to my vatos
E. Cuarenta Tequila and carne asada street tacos
Jarritos is my favorite soda
A dollar and some change it cost me for my Rover, uh
And fuck my enemies
Any of 'em threaten me then it's gon' be some life-threatening injuries
When they smelled that smell, they knew they was about to lose 'em
'Cause when you die, you have a bowel movement
Play with me, I lie in wait
Make you think that I'm scared, you'll meet your fate
Your life will be over, they'll close the drape
Bring the evidence markers, the white chalk and yellow tape
BIATCH!

[Chorus]
This an AP on my wrist, not a wristband
Taking risks in the kitchen, pepper in my hand
I turn a rack into a hundred bands
The goon with the spoon, the Pots and Pan Man (pots and pans)
This an AP on my wrist, not a wristband
Taking risks in the kitchen, pepper in my hand
I turn a rack into a hundred bands
The goon with the spoon, the Pots and Pan Man (pots and pans)

[Outro]
The Pots and Pan Man
(What's your handle?) The Pots and Pan Man
(What's your handle?) The Pots and Pan Man
The goon with the spoon, the Pots and Pan Man, BIATCH!
