[Chorus]
I said hey lil momma, what’s the deal
Talk to me girl I’ma keep it real
I’ve been on you since you walked through the door
Now drop it low like there's money on the floor
Like there's money on the floor oh
Now drop it low like there's Money on the floor oh
Yeah, now drop it low like it’s money on the floor oh
Pick it up girl, pick it up girl
Drop it low like there's money on the floor oh
Pick it up girl, pick it up, girl
Drop it low like it’s money on the floor

[Verse 1: Too Short]
All that sexy dancing, the hair and the dress is so romantic
It’s so sexual, wiggle that body girl let it go
It’s got me intoxicated
Like drugs, it’s got me faded
The visual is amazing
3-D digital entertainment
The women are beautiful here
And they come from everywhere
From all over the world
Come here, you see the most beautiful girls
They make it clap, throw that back
Bend over and show that crack
That booty is so damn fat
How you make it go like that

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 2: E-40]
She a flirt, she look like pet milk come out when she squirt
She don’t believe in wearing panties under her skirt
No bra under her shirt
I like the way she twerk
This ya one right here baby this your motivation
Make your cheeks applaud like a standing ovation
Got my dick hard like incarceration
Let me buy you a drink, intostication hello uuaah
Ain't nothing square about this hustler here man
Give a chick a Chinese name
One gone Play head games
But you want more, want more
Get it real within your rear, it's smacking yo mind
Baby girl they call me Earl
I rap and I rhyme but I used to sell that swirl
That white, white, white candycane and Mother of Pearl
Its right, right, right biiitch!

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 3: Too Short & E-40]

[Too Short]
I need to penetrate her
Hook it up like a generator
And make electricity
With that booty, she don't miss the beat
I don’t wanna kiss the freak
That ass is just a magical mystery
I can’t take that shit
Put her on top, she'll break that dick

[E-40]
Shopaholic, Soho, she got a badass shape, like Coco
She young but her body full of figure
You oughtta see her momma they could pass for sisters, Uh oh
For some strange reason I gotta thing
There's something about a broad and some white jeans
Make her feeling through her pants when she back it up
Thicker than the Reese's peanut butter cup biiitch

[Chorus x1]
