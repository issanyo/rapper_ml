[Verse 1: Brvndon P]
No fake around me homie
All I really know is boss talk
You know what it be homie
All I really know is real talk
100, I'mma keep it 100
RPSMG the clique boy
You know how we do it
Oh buddy, Oh no buddy
Lil mama like my style
She ain't get nuthin' from me
I keep it PG, that's Penny Hardaway
I walk a narrow path, that's a runaway
New Golden State, catch me in the bay
Out fielding in the hood, that's a triple plate
Talk about me, man you don't really know me
I'mma keep it 100 like I'm charging up my celly
If you see me slippin', call me up about it
I'mma keep it 100, you can never doubt
It

[Hook: BrvndonP]
No fake around me, what I'm talk about
You see that real talk, man I walk it out
I ain't changing nuthin, nope not a thing
I keep it 100, no fakery
Yeah, no fakery
I keep it 100, no fakery

[Verse 2: E-40]
Errwhere I go, I gotta be me
You check my history, no fakery
Vallejo, California, the V raised me
(What else?) No more selling keys, I sell CDs
We can go from the shoulders, I look you in the eye
That's the way that they taught me when I was 5
I ain't in the fakeness, I'm in the business
Give you the business, make it my business to get in yo bidness
Errytime I look around
I see the same gang goofy clowns
Hating on the anda
When I walk in the room, I steal they thunder
Papered up like a printer, my game is sharp as a splinter
You know I'm a winner, don't want me losing my temper
I banging with BrvndonP, armored beast
Ain't no snaking me
Having dough like a bakery
Man, I ain't into fakery
I'm real

[Hook: BrvndonP]
No fake around me, what I'm talk about
You see that real talk, man I walk it out
I ain't changing nuthin, nope not a thing
I keep it 100, no fakery
Yeah, no fakery
I keep it 100, no fakery

[Verse 3: BrvndonP]
New fix, new breaks
Told me to go get em'
All I know is okay
Tried to tear me down, I ain't switching
No way, See the last be first
All I know is first place
So Lord, they coming for me
I ain't running, I'm gunning
For how they wanna do it
People always talking
Pray for em' like
Oh Lord, Oh Lord they done messed up
Last be first, playing catch up
Stay true to myself, no matter how you feel
No movie, this the real my dude

[Hook: BrvndonP]
No fake around me, what I'm talk about
You see that real talk, man I walk it out
I ain't changing nuthin, nope not a thing
I keep it 100, no fakery
Yeah, no fakery
I keep it 100, no fakery
