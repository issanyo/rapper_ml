[Intro:]
Sixty eight inches above sea level
Ninty three millions miles above these devils
Play me in the winter play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn-any order[x4]
Oohh
(Play me in the winter play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn-any order)[x2]
We gotta anotha one pimp (we got anotha one)
Rock with em up boy (we got anotha one)
Sick wid it records E-40 (E-40)
(Warner brothers)
Oohh

[Verse 1:]
I'm tryna get ma beak wet, I'm a let u shoot da dice and im a side bet
Still hungry just ate, medallion same size as a dinner plate
D bay ainâ€™t been d same since I took a break
Whey you been 40? buyin real estate
I can't stop, play me fast fuck around and get mollywhopped
Just got my cob out da shop, wat color u paint it pimp  (apricot)
You never stop me in da function with a pink coat
Wippin da sweat off ma face with a c-note
They call me uncle 40 water the ambassador, the top tomata
And to all u sucka's tryina hate, 40 water doin great

[Chorus:]
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador[x3]
I'm the ambassador of da yay (of da yay)
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador[x2]
I'm the ambassador, I'm the ambassador
I'm the ambassador of da yay (of da yay)

[Verse 2:]
Play me in da winter play me in da summer
I'm a old schooler and a new comer
40 got spit ems ya'll he be gassin
After all these years he still smilin
Dats wat people be sayin  it's somethin about him he got some die hard fans (dedicated)
Real walkie people really care about him
Local boy made good ex d-boy made it out the hood
Got his gouda up to par, use to cook yola in a relish jar
If a sucka trip and try to suck us out the water
Don't just sit there and let him murder mouth yo partna
Teach his ass a lesson, toot him up and give him the thirty second blessin

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I live in da bay with da stingrays and sharks, delta eighty eight bounty fields and sky marks
You can't be no mark marshmallows get pumped if they ain't got no heart
Thumper happy out here they like to clap
Don't get mad and come back
Get down where they mad at
We'll finish it if u start it,  air da club out like a muthafucka fart
Money maniac scorpio dats ma zodiac
Ain't nuthin new under da sun
I reach in my pocket and give my one's to da bums
When the homie go down we bail his ass out
We pass d hat around
I remember when they thought the west was a goner
I gave em cpr and brought us out a coma

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Play me in the winter play me in the summer
Play me in the autumn-any order [x4])
