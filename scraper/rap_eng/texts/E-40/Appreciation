[Intro: E-40]
Let me talk about some real subjects, man
Speak on some real subjects, bruh
You know I gotta come off real every time, man
I'm E-40, man (talk to 'em)
I been spillin' these really deep messages for many moons, man (hecka long, bruh, we grew up on you, bruh, we grew up on you)
Listen up

[Verse 1: E:40]
Life is finicky
You never know when you creatin' a memory
You never know when you creatin' a enemy
You never know when you creatin' a friend to me

Tryin' to get by
Tell the devil that he's a lie
Gotta bleed the blood of Jesus
And repent before we die

Love yo' family
Even though they can be wrong
'Cause you gon' miss 'em
When ya family dead and gone

Hug and kiss 'em
Don't let 'em think that they're alone
Tell 'em you miss 'em
And they always welcome home

[Chorus: Bosko (and E-40)]
Make sure, with loved ones don't ever act evil
('Cause them yo' people)
And pick up when folks tryin' to reach you
(When folks tryin' to reach you)
And be sure they know that you appreciate them
(Let 'em know you appreciate 'em, man)

'Cause what you have can be gone in a blink
(It could be gone in a blink)
What really matters is not what you think
(It's not what you think)
So be sure you show some appreciation
(Show some appreciation)

[Verse 2: E-40]
Tough times, no goals
Dark hearts, lost souls
Snakes, sharks, black roles
Fake smarks, scarecrows

Should I keep this job?
Or should I go back to push and hustlin'?
A little bit of somethin'
Is better than a whole lot of nothin'

Every time I take a step forward
I take a step back
And every time I take a step back
I take a step forward

Never kick a person when they down
Lift 'em up
You never know when you gon' need a hand
Or a buck

[Chorus: Bosko (and E-40)]

[Verse 3: E-40]
(Listen here, man)
If he on drugs and you knew him
Don't walk away from him, walk to him
Don't stay away from him, talk to him
Cheer for him, don't boo him

Tell him you here for him
'fore you lose him
Happy to hear from him
Move him

Be careful
But embrace him
Give him some game
Lace him

My mind is filled with rage
The ghetto is a cage
We got a lot of talent
But we ain't got no stage

[Chorus: Bosko (and E-40)]
