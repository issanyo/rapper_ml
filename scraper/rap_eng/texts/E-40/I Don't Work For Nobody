[Hook: Stressmatic]
My niggas sick, they tear up the whole party
Keep a banger on the seat, he ride shotty
Got a cool ass broad with hella body
I’m a boss, I don’t work for nobody
I don’t work for nobody
I don’t work for nobody
I’m a boss, I don’t work nobody

[Verse 1:  E-40]
Nah, I don’t push dope, Officer Smokey, I push rhymes
M.O.B. —Musically Orchestrated Basslines
Ask about me, I’ve been out the game forever
Got in and out, I was smart and way too clever
Survived the drought, seasoned, managed heathen
Took the under route, backroads, bobbin’ and weavin’
Tryna sprout, believe me man, I’m eating
Without a doubt, gotta hella shows every weekend
We don’t ball out here, we take it there
They talk it, we walk it
I’m a polar bear, he a panda bear
Don’t let me get started
You can have that shit
He titties smell like feet
That’s why I didn’t hit
I just skeeted on her teeth
My money long like the credits at the end of a movie
I’m hella known, I’m on, but I ain’t bootsy
Prepared, raw, be big and stocky
40 fly kick like karate
I don’t work for nobody (BIATCH!)

[Hook: Stressmatic + (E-40)]
My niggas sick, they tear up the whole party
Keep a banger on the seat, he ride shotty
Got a cool ass broad with hella body
I’m a boss, I don’t work for nobody
(I don’t work for nobody)
I don’t work for nobody
(I don’t work for nobody)
I don’t work for nobody
(I don’t work for nobody)
I’m a boss, I don’t work nobody

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Shot callers never take orders
We stand taller, make you feel shorter
You dream it, we just do it
Milk it ‘til it’s dry, then I’m through with it
Get some new shit, I’m on a new grind
Hit a quick lick, but only two times
And it’s easy to go make mo’
‘Cause my bottom bitch is so faithful
I was out of town, about six weeks
Would never go home, I live in big suites
My bitch stay down, getting hella racks
She know I play around, so don’t tell her that
She getting mad at you, cuss you out
I’m a boss, she know what the fuck I’m ‘bout
Stretch limousines, first class
You got a job? Muthafucka, where you work at?

[Hook: Stressmatic + (E-40)]
My niggas sick, they tear up the whole party

I don’t work for nobody

[Verse 3]
[E-40]
Don’t act like you never heard of us, authentic
No MSG, additives or preservatives
Laced by dope fiends and murderers
Not bozos in circuses
The poor get poor, the rich getting richer
The sore get sorer, the sick getting sicker
I recoup, I done recouped, I don’t know nann nigga
I’m in the mix, not out the loop, bitch, I’m a fixture
[Too $hort]
We ain’t going nowhere, we legendary
So hard in the game, you hella scary
People know my name everywhere
It’s nothing but love from the real players
Don’t roll down the window trying to feel the air
You’ll never be cool, you’re still a square
Don’t come around the Town if y’all scared
‘Cause in the Bay it’s so wild out here

[Hook: Stressmatic + (E-40)]
