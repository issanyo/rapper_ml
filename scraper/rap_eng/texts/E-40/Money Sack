[Intro: Boosie & E-40]
Aww shit
Ayo, 40, I'm home, nigga! (Home, nigga)
Welcome home, family

[Verse 1: Boosie]
Four deep in the Cut dawg cruisin'
Four real niggas, four Rugers
Money on my mind as we bump straight Boosie (Straight Boosie)
Straight Boosie, that new Bay music (Turn up)
40 on my lap as I cruise with my bad chick (Bad chick)
Bad chick, badder than my last chick
All my dudes, we spark a lot
So we toting big pistols in the parking lot
We on that dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb shit
My side ride or die on that "Where you from?" shit (Hey)
East Oakland (East Oakland), where you at, thug?
(Where you at, thug?)
Whip it whip it whip it, bring it back, bruh
Real nigga, you ain't even gotta ask, thug (Ask what?)
Lost some real niggas so I'm tatted up (Tatted up)
Chi-town pass so I'm gatted up
Niggas on the bean, sliding, one lay out

[Chorus: Boosie & E-40]
Woke up this morning like fuck that
(Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck that shit)
Man, it's time to get my money sack
(I said, man, it's time to get my money sack)
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Boosie, let me holla at 'em right quick, mayne, 40

[Verse 2: E-40]
Woke up this morning like 'fuck that'
Opened up a loud pack and rolled a baseball bat
That's that power that's strong, took a shower and grabbed my chrome
Smith and Wesson 4-5th leave a bitch nigga stiff
From the beginning, my nigga, bruh, I was trained to go
I was plotting on dope when I was an embryo
Trying to make an honest dollar didn't work for me (Work for me)
So I did what I had to do for my family (Family)
We on that dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb shit (Dumb shit)
Hit a bitch nigga with a drumstick (Drumstick)
Dragging my knuckles on the ground like an ape (Like an ape)
Tougher than a three-dollar steak (Dollar steak)
Psychedelic colors in my Presidential (Presidential)
I'm a real one, I ain't got no bitch potential (No bitch potential)
Raised in a drug infested environment (Environment)
Free all of my real ones in solitary confinement
BIATCH!

[Chorus: Boosie & E-40]
Woke up this morning like fuck that
(Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck that shit)
Man, it's time to get my money sack
(I said, man, it's time to get my money sack)
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle

[Interlude: Boosie & (E-40)]
My money sack (My money sack, ay)
My money sack (My money sack, ay)
Gettin' that money sack (Ay, out here gettin' it mayne, yeah)
Every show, a hundred stacks (A hundred stacks, nigga, fuck with that, ha ha, BIATCH!)
(Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay)
Don't stop (BIATCH!)

[Chorus: Boosie & E-40]
Woke up this morning like fuck that
(Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it, fuck that shit)
Man, it's time to get my money sack
(I said, man, it's time to get my money sack)
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle, hustle
