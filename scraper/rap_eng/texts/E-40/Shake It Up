[Intro: 24hrs]
24hrs
OZ on the beat, yeah

[Chorus: 24hrs, MadeinTYO & G-Eazy]
The bigger I get, it feel like more stress (Ooh)
YSL jacket and she got the dress (Skrt, sauce)
I just talked to God and He said that I'm blessed
(Thank you, Jesus, ooh)
I go for the more and you go for the less (Yeah)
Ooh, bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up (Yeah)
She gon' make it up (Gerald)
Bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up (Yeah)
Bet I shake it up
She gon' make it up (Yeah)

[Verse 1: G-Eazy]
I came up, it couldn't happen no faster (ooh)
She ain't the baddest here, then I run past her
Party ain't lit, then I get Casper
Young Gerald a bastard
This flow has been mastered
Could date a hundred years, fuck a million times, won't get my password
The more guala, then the more problems come the bigger you get
I play a show, I just pick up a jet
Then I pick up a check
Cause and effect
I seen the world, bruh I been to Tibet
All of the bags that this kid finna get
You out here doin' the same shit again and again
I'm surprised we ain't sick of you yet (ooh)
Yeah, I sipped the bourbon
Bitch I put the work in
Look I been a factor
Pull my car, your arm get a fracture
You ain't real, bitch you been a actor
I know the soil like I'm in a tractor
Like John Deere, don't wanna take it back there
Look, I'm from the Bay, I touch green all day, look, I'm just like a Packer, yeah
40 told me his game evolved
She gave it up, there's probably fame involved
Hit the club and we came and balled like Draymond called
Status quo, bitch, I shake it up
These white moms who I've shaken up
They'd probably vote for Trump
But their daughters know that I'm paper'ed up (yeah)

[Chorus: 24hrs, MadeinTYO & E-40]
The bigger I get, it feel like more stress (Ooh)
YSL jacket and she got the dress (Skrt, sauce)
I just talked to God and He said that I'm blessed
(Thank you, Jesus, ooh)
I go for the more and you go for the less (Yeah)
Ooh, bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up (Hey)
She gon' make it up
Bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up (Uh)
Bet I shake it up
She gon' make it up (Uh)

[Verse 2: E-40]
Uh, I don't like too many people, they ain't gotta like me
36-zipper from a ounce to a key
I wanna thank you OB for your presidency
For grantin' little D his clemecency
Real recognize real when I'm checkin' hella skrill
Blowin' big kill on a cliff on the hill
Came a long way and it seems so real
Used to keeps the block just like a pussy willow
Smokin' big flowers, blowin' on Durban
Pushin' up a rock, go fiend servin'
She natural like a afro, MSG no gluten
I'll be rushin' but I never met Putin

[Chorus: 24hrs & MadeinTYO]
The bigger I get, it feel like more stress (Biatch)
YSL jacket and she got the dress (skrr, sauce)
I just talked to God and He said that I'm blessed
(Thank you, Jesus, ooh)
I go for the more and you go for the less (Yeah)
Ooh, bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up (Double up)
Bet I shake it up (Hey)
She gon' make it up
Bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up
She gon' make it up (Uh)

[Verse 3: MadeinTYO]
Uh, you excited bruh, I can tell
Got a couple checks in the mail
Smokin' green, ooh, that's kale
Taco Bell
Nigga, pop yo shell
Babylon in the mail, uh
Tomb Raider off the top, uh
Don't save her, she a thot, uh
Diamonds dancin', do the wop
So icy like the Wop, uh
Lego head, do the block, uh
Pop-pop till you stop, uh
You the 12, you the opp, uh
Throw it back for the Gram, uh
Hot dog goin' HAM, uh
Gelato smokin', Shazam, uh
10 bands, Gucci Mane, ooh

[Chorus: 24hrs & MadeinTYO]
The bigger I get, it feel like more stress (Ooh)
YSL jacket and she got the dress (Skrt, sauce)
I just talked to God and He said that I'm blessed
(Thank you, Jesus, ooh)
I go for the more and you go for the less (Yeah)
Ooh, bet I shake it up
Bet I shake it up (Double up)
Bet I shake it up (Hey)
