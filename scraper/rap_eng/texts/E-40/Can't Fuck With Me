[Chorus]
Y'all can't fuck wit me (repeated)

Y'all can't fuck with me, chain around my neck same colour as pee
In the bay they call it wet like the ocean and the sea
I'm throwing up my set and I'm yelling out the V
Vallejo California y'all players tops like armour all
Paper long like a conference call
Ducking and dodging Johnny law
Wanna ball like Chris [?] but I'm not in the NBA
My DBA is selling alcohol, music and real estate
We done came a long way, Charlie Hustle in my DNA
Same product different hustle, different plinay
ODB DB and E-40
November 15th, we share the same birthday
Scorpio mines is Prodigy like the homie Lil Booise
Real ones love us fake ones hate us, wanna smoke me like a loosie
Wanna pluck me like a guitar
It's not a movie this ain't pixar
I got an uzi for any sucker wanna shoot me

[Chorus]

My criminal lawyer is Dan Russo
My entertainment lawyer is Bob Lieberman
The bail bonds that I choose is Ann Hill
Just in case this hustler go to jail
I'm a side bail when it comes to these coins, come to these coins
Mack game, my dollar coin like dollar coins
Crack game, seen it and lived it, been in it and done it
Rap game really and truly is all i wanted
My car might get to poppin a wheely
Zero to sixty, the manifold open
She start my nigga bitch hella pretty hold it!
Panty's be sticky, soaking!

[Chorus]

They can't fuck wit me man!
They can't fuck wit me!
This beat will make you raise your eyebrows
Fuck your radio and PPM we got pandora now
Spotify and sirius satellite
For the PBs that act like ass wipes
Have my money taller than giraffe necks
Papered up like a cheque
One of my favourite pistols is a SPringfield
Better duck before you get wet
I got diamonds and a trapezium in my delotids
When theres a problem i let my binoys drop my tinnoys
Fucking around let me rubble with a soup box bubble
Extra extra, bring back double
My life is important and it ain't ever been boring
We don't believe in no yawning we up all night till the morning
She attracted she like me, she say im saucy and icy
She know im active and mighty she want me to smash it and pie sheet

[Chorus]
