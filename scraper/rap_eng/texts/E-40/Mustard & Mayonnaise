Throw me a bone and some crumbs watch me turn it over and flip it
Ballatician, man, ballaholic I'm ballerific
Stop and listen give me yo undivided attention
40 talk like E.F. Hutton... shhhh, people listen
Man that boy there right there be clownin he do the foo!
Hustle Charlie water that playa there hella coo!
Often imitated but never diznuplicated
Kilo grams of coke and that broccoli I used to weigh it
Smokin' Ahfganny in the candy blue drop Camaro
On my way to Richmond to buy me some new apparel
Bendin' corners, gettin' it crooked and talkin bout look it
"There go fonzerelli I'm feelin that mans music"
Don't you quit that shit you be talkin, its big spit
Later for them suckas they tardy they ain't hit
Disobeying ???? from you ??? don't let her see
Get you're wonder bread pepperoni watch it increase

[Hook x2]
Mustard and Mayonnaise! Tennis shoes, lowenheart, drivers lorenzos, 22's
Big bread, big spread, big scratch,big cars, turf hogs, Cadillacs

Watchout ersky perky it's seldom you see me thirsty
Gatorade bottle full of Burgundy Carlos Rossi
Lift yo head high, we might take you up out yo body
Me and my mossy motherfuckers life of the party
Give it to me baby you know what I'm lookin fo'
A super ghetto ho, big ol' ass like J-Lo
Club packed, like a Detroit hair show
Dug that, she can teach the wind how to blow
She can teach frosty how to snow, right, glow
In the dark lay, night, fireworks, sparklight, ALL-night
Ride her like Olympic style tour de' france bike
Brand new upholstery, flambostly out wit the fellas
In the hotel lobby wit honey gettin jealous
Ain't nobody trippin', but patna, he outta line
Spray myself with sucker-repellent pulled out my nine

[Hook x2]

I got a shortage of supply and demand when its drought
Buy low, sell high, my marble route
Know about the weather before its about to change
My repo, they distribute, they repo be drivin planes
Watch out for them folks and them K-9's sniffin them thangs
Bricks, kicks, hittin MC's and door panels man
I run my game from Frisco to Maine, pimpin long range
Fast quarter fuck a slow nickel thats chump change
Place your order, high yellow jazzy, light bright and almost like
Chocolate trailer trashy mcnasty throw away but now she's classy
Cuz her sugar daddy done put her up in the sink
Washed her up got her dressed in hot pink in mink

[Hook x2]

Gotta ride on vogues when we fly by
Ondelay Arrivederci Bonita bye bye
Mustard and mayonnaise smokin up at the sky light
You can't touch my vogues baby bye bye..
