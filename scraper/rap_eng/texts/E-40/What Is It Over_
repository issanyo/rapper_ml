[Chorus]
Same hood same block same city yea we all come from the same place
(same hood same block same city)
Why we family yet we funkin with each other tell me how’d it end up this way
(same hood same block same city)
Same hood same block same city yea we all come from the same place
(same hood same block same city)
Used to be friends now we warring with  each other  tell me how’d it end up this way

[Verse 1]
They went to kindergarten together lived round the corner from each other pop warner together played sports together
His mother grew up with his mother
Now is a game of cat and mouse they hunting they tucking they barkin ducking and hiding and running
Bustin and dumping bucket and gunnin I don't know why
Is it childhood friends always end up beefing warring and funking falling out with each other over  some money or a woman?
At first nobody died just a couple of fights and some shit talking
But once somebody died its almost impossible to solve the problem its almost like
56 once they spot him in the daylight they got him coming up outta his cab split his ass in half
Walked away like nothing happened without even being noticed a couple aliens from out of town a couple of foot soldiers
Stolen toyota corolla parked down the street tank down near empty foot soldiers on feet
Jumped in the car and got windy in these streets you can't be weak can't poodle up and be too friendly
They're sneaky man they cheeky  so called friends become frenemies

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Rule of thumb number one never leave the crib without packing you a gun can't be snoozing
When you feuding man protect your punk ass at all times stay wolf you might wanna get your pen and pad
While I explain the rules
It used to be unity in the hood but niggas hate to see the next nigga do good the next nigga got work
Ethic and yours ain't what it should every second a child is born every second one tooken away just a other day
A lil baby got hit with a stray bullet they poured it cut him down with a k
In the middle of the day missed they  target they got away s’why
I always pray huddled up I say me and my family members like we calling a play better
Watch who you talking around never know who know who cuz a hit can come out the blue just like the flu
Cuz ugly out here’s trifling and they betray you for some money some shit you thought your folks would never do bitch !

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
What  is it over (what  is it over   man ) what  is it over (what  is it over ? )
What  is it over (what  is it over   man ) what  is it over (what  is it over ? )
What  is it over ( a bitch  ) what  is it over (pride ) what  is it over (money ) what  is it over (jealousy )

[Chorus]
