[Intro]
Ayo folks
Looky here
It is I says me
Your Northern Cali-formula
West Coast star stoppin', cool-type delivery spittin', tycoon talkin' partner
E motherfuckin' Forty O-Z, understand me
Good listenin', begin-ish and intermission for the trunk knockin', big blockin' yes indeeds
Cross walk stopping, bumble cause nosebleeds
Also designed for ditchin' and shaking the one-time popo penelopes
Young street soldiers from the lower development housing
Tryin' to get nigga rich by taking full advantage of this new scrilla-making D game we call rap
Understanding my system is to have heart
Have money
Have street
And to have hustle
Oh the shit is going down ritt now as I speak, man
So if you ain't got your Hurricane Ethel, you best to go fetch it A-S-A-P
And here go the recipe
One-fifty-one Bacardi dark
Bacardi light
Triple Sec
Grenadine
Pineapple juice
And an empty container of Arrowhead water
Like Forty Water
Put it all in one you got some good shit
So get your bidis and your broccoli
And your Zap' 'Force ready
Cause we 'bout to take it to the next
We 'bout to take it to the next
We 'bout to take it to the next
