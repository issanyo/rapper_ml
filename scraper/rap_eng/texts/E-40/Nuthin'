[Verse 1: T-Pain]
You niggas ain't nothin', nothin', nothin'
See me undercover, fist pumpin' with your cousin
Pull up to the club, let ya hear the speakers bump
Wit' a honey and a Hummer, got her cummin' on my thumb
I am second to none, drummer steady drummin'
And I don't need keys, I'm just thumpin' on the button
Shawty want my love and she not thinkin' nothin' of it
So I told her, "get in line," she can come and take a number
She lookin' at my pocket like she gettin' something from me
And if she think she is, then this bitch is really dumb and
I'm a boss, get lost, Maybach, Rick Ross
I'm lookin' for a chick wit' the ability to keep that booty jumpin'
Ya see what I got cookin'? Put my meat up in that oven
And when it's all over, you can get ready for supper
They say that I'm a pornstar, call me T-Pumper

[Hook: Detail & T-Pain]
What ya say? What ya say?
Yeah, got her shakin' that thing like it's
(Huh) (Hell naw!) (Hell naw!)
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it
Got her suckin' and fuckin' like it's nothin', nothin', nothin'

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Look at this motherfuckin' rug that I'm cuttin'
These bitches act sidity but these chickens steady cluckin'
Like it's nothin', nothin', nothin and they don't give a fuck if
I'm up in the Maserati or I'm duckin' in a bucket and I love it
Big chain, Teddy P, T-Pain, that's me
I do my thang, twenty-eights, turnin' lane
They see me wit' a couple bad bitches and they know I keep it truckin'
Bottle of that drink and I'm feelin' kinda lucky
And if they playin' games, it's the deuces that I'm chuckin'
Cause they know why they came, they ain't fuckin'? Nigga, fuck 'em
In the butt, what's up? Damn right, you gon' let a nigga cut
Fo sho', yee ain't know? Teddy Pain from the 8-5-0, pussy nigga ain't

[Hook: Detail & (T-Pain)]
What ya say? What ya say?
Yeah, got her shakin' that thing like it's
(Huh) (Hell naw!) (Hell naw!)
Said her ass so fat, she ain't even tryna tuck it
Got her suckin' and fuckin'-

[Verse 3: E-40]
She might be 19, but she ain't green
Her coochie get sticky and goopy like Vaseline (uh!)
But I'm much growner, so I sick my son, Droop-E, on her
He knocked it out the park, hit a homer all four quarters
Zip of broc' and a six-pack of Corona
Damn fool, he a boss like his pops, ganged-up, hella cool (bitch!)
When I slide through the function, kisses and huggin'
Hella alcohol and I ain't talkin' 'bout rubbin'
Squares mean muggin', cause we forward and they backwards
They got a 'N' on they chest for "nothin'"
I got a 'S' on my chest for "somethin'" (uh!)
So, what I told that square ass poodle? (What you tell that money?)
"I'll spaghetti yo' noodle!" (yo' noodle)
She off Ciroc and that Henny and that Landy
Got on pink panties lookin' like Nuvo, bi-otch!
