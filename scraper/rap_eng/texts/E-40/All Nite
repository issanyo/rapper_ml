[Verse 1: E-40]
Long dollars
All I think about is commas
Sex and liquor and nice cars
Jewelry, clothes and weed jars
Get to it
I'm off of this fluid, I'm used to it
Higher than Pluto, I stay zooted
Blow tree like a bugle, I get stupid
Feelin' like I'm 'posed to, I'm the guy to go to
Everybody know me, don't nobody know you
Everybody know me, don't nobody know you
Everybody know me, don't nobody know you
Me and all my whole crew, look us up on Google
You don't wanna fuck with us, we'll bust your noodle
You don't wanna fuck with us, we'll bust your noodle
You don't wanna fuck with us, we'll bust your noodle

[Hook: E-40]
All night
We go mainey all night
All night
Hit the after party 'til the sunlight
All night
Take her to the telly, lay the pidnipe (The pipe)
Get to it
I'm off of this fluid, I'm used to it
Higher than Pluto, I stay zooted
Blow tree like a bugle, I get stupid (Get stupid)
All night
We go mainey all night
All night
Hit the after party 'til the sunlight (Hit the afterparty, mayne)
All night
All night
We go mainey all night, uh
All night
All night
We go mainey all night
All night
All night
We go mainey all night (How we do it, Too Short?)

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
Up all night
Like I ain't got no life
I don't give a fuck about a clock right now
I'm on that shit and I'm 'bout to go wild
Don't try to tell me how I tore shit up
Drink too much and then fuck two sluts
You know what this is
I'm up in here tryna fuck some bitches
Too $hort is here
Why you wanna party with a bunch of squares?
When you can hang with us
We wild and dangerous
Shake them lame fucks
We'll never sleep, we stayin' up
Up all night
We up all night, bitch

[Hook: E-40]
All night
We go mainey all night
All night
Hit the after party 'til the sunlight
All night
All night
We go mainey all night, uh
All night
All night
We go mainey all night
All night
All night

We go mainey all night
All night
