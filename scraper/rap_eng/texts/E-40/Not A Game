[Intro: E-40]
All I know is hustle
All I know is Bubba
All I know is struggle
All I know is trouble
All I know is smuggle
All I know is double

[Verse 1: Daveed Diggs]
Ain’t nobody business but the town
All of the scales, it’s digital underground
(step up, step, step, step up, step up)
So you know I get around
But I be right back like the cracks in the foundation
That’s why we like what’s cracking and what’s shaking
Bay slang birthed from the earthquakin’
And we bend never break, fast everyday
Hungry tummy always coming for the biggest plate
And the shift right left like the wipers on the scraper
Though the rain gon' come why you hiding under paper
No seeds, rolling tree with a looseleaf garden
Call a spade a nigga but these niggas
They ain’t sharp enough to break dirt
Better know I’ve been about the soil
Cali been about the gold like Texas been about the oil
So slick when I slide through
Chick wanna ride too
Clique bonafide, homicide like the nine do
Mind been on “I do”
Married to the hustle on fire like Piru, no blood
Muscle on wide I’m middle of the block like “what?”
Same white tee, still don’t give a fuck
Same white teeth, same smile, still suck
Same white people sitting with the game, fucked up
Set my day one spitting with the flame untucked
This the bay, son you missin’ what we saying, dumb luck

[Hook: E-40]
Yo, uh
What you thought it was a game?
Dominoes and bones when it's money on the way
Break a couple for you when you run into the gang
Don't be acting brand new if you really wanna play
Bitch welcome to the Bay

[Verse 2: Rafael Casal]
I don't got too many friends now
Many robbed me of my intiution so I exed 'em
Playin' my position I got 20/20 vision
I don't listen if the pimpin' isn't part of how you flex 'em
Got me feelin' extra, bless up
3-deep the car
