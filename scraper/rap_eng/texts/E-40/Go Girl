Excuse me miss, what's your name
I don't wanna tell you the same ol' thing
Drop, drop it low, make, make it pop
I can do this all night shorty
I don't wanna stop

I need a go girl
I need a go girl, uh
Go, go girl, go, go, go, go, go
I need a go girl

Go girl, uh, a show girl
Uh, go-getter, for cheddar
Denero, dope girl, a money on the dance floor
Getting low girl, uh, a trow girl
With game that'll make my toes curl
Cause she's a beast in the bed and I'ma beast with her
Beat it up like a champ and uh she re-twitter
Bash be going hard, it's the headline news
She rocking the fresh js, stilettos, the Jimmy Chu's

Black white and yellow bone, watchin' what they jelly on
Bringing major fedy home oo what's poppin
We hit em with the honey tone
Bringing daddy money home
Got me ridin candy chrome
What that do

Shoppin' for a new pair
Stuntin' on you boppers
In the D.J. booth
Giggin' with some punk rockers
She my runnin' back, player
I'm the quarterback
Send her down to Meh-hico
She bringing me the border back

Excuse me miss, what's your name
I don't wanna tell you the same ol' thing
Drop, drop it low, make, make it pop
I can do this all night shorty
I don't wanna stop

Go, go girl, go, go, go, go, go

Ugh, she over there hittin' it
She getting it
Grittin' it, grindin it, and grippin' it
Poppin', lockin, droppin' and dippin' it
Pickin' it up and lickin' it
Never missin' a beat or skippin'
She know that the fixtress diggin' it
Look at her go, she kill it
Bad ass boots
Big ass caboose
I'm tryin to get her drunk
Take her to the telian goose
Spark a fat ass blunt
Put a towel under the door
Unplug the smoke detector
Get my nut off and then eject her

Imma macaroni man
I don't think y'all understand
I don't pay for pussy mane
Pussy pay me mane
Ready stackin' hustler man
All about my rubber bands
Real nigga havin' change bout money

Ugh, Gotta keep my paper right
Baby the brain washer's up all night
Picture this flow, she getting my dough
She bought a brand new bike
Letting em know, used to be poor
I don't care she diet
Baby can go, put on a show, she do what I like

Excuse me miss, what's your name
I don't wanna tell you the same ol' thing
Drop, drop it low, make, make it pop
I can do this all night shorty
