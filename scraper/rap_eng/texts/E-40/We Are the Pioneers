[Chorus 4X]
(We are…we are…we are the pioneers
We are the pioneers)

[Verse 1: E-40]
UH!
Hustling nonstop
From a relish jar to a soup pot
From the bottom to the top
Fans all over the world, signing autographs for cops
Something I wouldn’t have did if it was 24 years ago
(What about now?) But now I’m legit though, uh
No more pushing cauliflower
Just microphone powder
Yowder, clam chowder, goop
You in the red, we in the black like a suit
Pockets obese, you famine, we feast
Mine’s paid for, yours is a lease (UH!)
(What is you?) We are the pioneers
(How long you been doing it?) We been doing this shit for years
Give us our ‘speck
My nigga, you ain’t never seen a blue check

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Too $hort]
It can’t be disputed
You know where it started
E-40 and $hort Dog
We keep making that hard shit
It’s been a long time
Ever since you was a young one
And we still spittin’ rhymes
I raised you like my own son
Call me pop, but I’m not a pop star
One-hit wonders never really got far
I don’t know why you talk smack
You was famous for a while but you ain’t ever coming back
You ask me, you never could rap
You look real corny, all the girls called you wack
We in the room now, you feel real small
Just look at all these plaques on the walls, bitch
(BIATCH!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
[E-40]
Earl and Todd will never play out or fall out, loyalty
You’re listening to West Coast royalty
It wasn’t an accident, we ain’t clumsy
We paved the way, taught you how to get independent money
Grew up on Magic Mike and Calvin T
From the Rich, shoutout to $hort and Freddie B
On my list is the greatest rappers to emcee
You’s a bitch if you don’t recognize me
BIATCH!

[Too $hort]
I’m with some hoes, and all the pimps see me
Every day in the street, I’m not on MTV
It’s a special, original programming
The History Channel is E-40 and $hort jammin’
Tune in, you just might learn something
‘Cause I’m shooting off sperm, nuttin’
I’m just planting new seeds
Trying to grow some more trees so I could smoke a lot of weed
BITCH!

[Chorus]
