[Intro]
Oh whoo ohh
Yea, yea
Noo, ooohhh

[Verse 1]
It’s tuff times man
It’s tuff times, pressure bust pikes
Stressin cause ulcers gotta eat white rice
We tryna do some clean but we end up doing dirty
Us dudes now a days don’t plan on living past 30
Beef ain't neva ova it’s herit to the children
There’s damage on my soil and the sidewalks smell like urine
Saved and sanctified she was a good little girl
Got hooked back slid now she’s in the world (in the world)
In the world? yea  in world means in sin
Used to speak in tongues but now she speak in gin
Ay where my scooter gotta keep my stapler with me
What you got automatic, semi  in my private box chevy

[Chorus]
Tuff times my baby on the respirator
No job, no food in the refrigerator
Tuff times, news say it’s gettin worst
Gotta change, gotta put it reverse
Tuff times, tuff times we goin get thru these tuff times

[Verse 2]
I’m looking in my wallet I’m comin up with nothin
Today my daughter birthday but my pockets touchin
She say she wants a jumper, balloon, some cake and friends
But I can’t even do it cause I ain't got no ends
I’m fresh up out the oo up am I man not a mouse
Got a get a job before they let me out the halfway house
It’s me against the system, tryna get reformed
It’s the mind sometimes I wish that I was never born
Everytime I lose my faith and get to reachin for my gun
I pick up my bible and read chronicles or psalms
I’m on my hands and knees askin God to forgive me
But Lord why do I have to pray for my enemies

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Folks be two faced, they’ll stab you in your back
With their best friend eased it happens due Jack
Take you from your family plot on your demise
Slicks lying scandalously element of surprise
My OG partna’s older sister she bout to go ballistic
She going through it cause she just found out her daughter is autistic
I told her not to worry it’s Jesus you believe in
Believe it or not everything happens for a reason
Listen to my spoke, I speak it from the heart
Ain't tardy yall I’m walt God gave me this art
To spit from the jaw and spill it from my gut
Give it to you raw unedit and uncut

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
He that dwelleth from the secret place of the most high
Shall abide under the shadow of the all mighty
I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my fortress
My God, in him will I trust
Surely he shall deliver thee from the  snare of the fowler
And from the annoyance of pestilence
He shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust
His truth will be thy shield
Thou shall not be afraid of the terror by night nor for the arrow that flieth by day
