[Verse 1:]
It’s wicked and merciless in my region, hooligans
Full of knuckleheads, killas and heathens
Cause niggas with dark hearts desire to stop niggas from breathin
Ugh listen he signal for a fair catch but they still hit him
Can’t be half ass hustlin and catin off
Can’t be loose as a porno pussy that’s how you get your head cut off
Yea so you serve for some off fuck change enough to buy a flying sperm
When they call in the ballation there ain't no competition
Blowin bitches mind like engine, blowin pistin
Big spliffing smokin a taylor to the fingernail
Holdin my breath until i turn pale
Sending packages in the mail prepared to post bail
To catch me they going put a hussla under the jail
I bear it not generic man you heard me
Exercising, calisthenics doin bourbons

[Chorus:]
Front buses, bussin, smokin, puffin, suits and jumpin
Drinkin, rushin, boots and subbin
Headache bufferin, loud enough to bust your bumpkin
Beatin’ the trunk loose [x8]

[Verse 2:]
Ugh when the drama’s drawn  things sucked up sucked up
But you can deep fry it like a burrito in front the taco truck
In the inner city no pity for the healthy or the sickly
It’s filthy it’s dusty man ripley’s won’t believe it
They gnarly, they party it’s hella turnt
Play with the fire you gonna get burnt
Get faith get em up put down the weapons
I don’t don’t want that stanky bitch you can have my sloppy seconds
I drinks gin and vodka stupid poppin my colla
Got a way with my words like barak
On the toilet readin the fader
Magazine with my magazine and my cater

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Ugh fresh up outta the parkin lot blabbin
My car is a tourist attraction
Fucker let me drop my drinks louis shots
Finger on my Glock blame the girls i pop
Pow pow pow made him pay
Off with his head he wasn’t using it anyway
Ugh play too much
Running aroun talkin tuff like he can’t get touched
Anybody can get it you name it i done did it
Ain't tellin on myself though i’ll never admit it
But you there saw how it ended i’ll never regret
Me and my niggas in the can fo bald headed and dreaded
Ugh heavy on the grind
That niggas name should never be mentioned in the same breath as mine

[Chorus:]
Front buses, bussin, smokin, puffin, suits and jumpin
Drinkin, rushin, boots and subbin
Headache bufferin, loud enough to bust your bumpkin
Beatin’ the trunk loose [x8]
Po-po-pump-o [x5]
Beatin’ the trunk loose [x8]
