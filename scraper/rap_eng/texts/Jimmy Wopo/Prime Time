[Chorus]
Soda with the yola, hit the soda, dopa dola
I can make the trap pop, Coca Cola
Jimmy Wop will show you how to flip them whole ones
La-la-la-la, fuck a nine to five, I be in the kitchen prime time
La-la-la-la, fuck a nine to five, I be in the kitchen grind time

[Verse 1]
Uh, five star meal, I’m on the airplane
Better yet a jet, bitch I got that air game
Catch his ass right after the hoop game
Beam on his tee look like a juice stain
Feelin' like I’m Bishop, got that juice mane
Perky on my bones, I don't feel no pain
Molly on my bones and my damn veins
But that TEC around my neck with the shoe string
Runnin' through the trap, I’m like Usain
I’m just kickin' old school in a new lane
I’m just a young nigga doin' my own thing
I just bought a super carbon, call him Bruce Wayne
All I do is gang, you just maintain
I'm a 90's baby, bitch we gang bang
Fuck attachments on my GG, left it plain jane
Ain’t no thirty on that thing, it hold seventeen
'Cause I ain’t fishin' from a distance, I like close range
I want see that body shakin' and them brains hang
Gave lil bro and them them choppers, they ain’t got no aim
Clutchin', buckin' shit up, tryna hit anything

[Chorus]
Got the soda with the yola, hit the soda, dopa dola
I can make the trap pop, Coca Cola
Jimmy Wop will show you how to flip them whole ones
La-la-la-la, fuck a nine to five, I be in the kitchen prime time
La-la-la-la, fuck a nine to five, I be in the kitchen grind time

[Verse 2]
Youngin ball like MJ back in '83
She wanna hear J-Wopo on a Sonny beat
But I’m trappin' right now and it's a Cardi B
Mixin' Henny and my dirty, I can hardly see
You only live once so I grind, can’t sleep
8-balls on the table, no MJG
Big guns make you run, no DMC
Why the fuck you wanna beef 'cause she DM me
Hundred stacks in a week, tryna hit MTV
Used to listen to them beats, write that heat off my MP3
RIP Louis V, Nigga free Lil D
And it's forty for a key nigga, ask AZ

[Outro]
Boogie, gang
What’s the deal nigga?
Uh, and bitch I’m 8-Block for life so I got that shit tatted
