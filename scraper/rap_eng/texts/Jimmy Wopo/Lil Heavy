[Verse 1]
Draco on me, ain't 'pose to have no Draco on me
Nigga run up in this bitch, I'm turnin' straight to Tony
Big choppa, but a nigga boney
Knock some sauce out your noodle, nigga rigatoni
Fuck it I'll go to jail, and kick it with whoadies
Kill me I'll burn in hell, with all my dead homies
Was a young shooter out there head hungry
Now if I want a nigga dead I'm puttin' bread on him
What's 20, shit I made that off a mixtape
Next mixtape, I need 50 bands straight
With the bricks, I may shit, I can't calculate
Get a [?] with the auto, I'll chop illustrate
AR in the car but I'm featherweight
I smoked this bitch nigga, his clique niggas gon' hesitate
I got some choppers for who with me and whoever ain't
I'm finna pull up to your mom's house and decorate

[Chorus]
Street nigga, with an attitude
Skinny nigga, with a heavy tool
I ain't tryna box, bitch I'd rather shoot
Got it off the block, off that avenue
Street nigga, with an attitude
Skinny nigga, with a heavy tool
I ain't tryna box, bitch I'd rather shoot
Got it off the block, off that avenue

[Verse 2]
You ain't heard about them last pussy niggas owed me
Boy please, I don't freeze, bitch I'm gettin' funky
I put a donut on your head, nigga holy moly
I melt niggas like cheese over pepperoni
I'm with Cheese or Jaweez, real niggas only
Bitch, we grew up playing the block like that nigga Boadie
I've never took it to the rack but I'm Jordan, Kobe
I told them blood niggas back like my OG Goldie
Nigga this gun bigger than [?] nigga he 5'5
He talkin' crazy off that molly, nigga he tryna die
Boy, don't think I'm finna box cause we the same size
GPS up on his chest, nigga I'm tryna find him

[Chorus]
Street nigga, with an attitude
Skinny nigga, with a heavy tool
I ain't tryna box, bitch I'd rather shoot
Got it off the block, off that avenue
Street nigga, with an attitude
Skinny nigga, with a heavy tool
I ain't tryna box, bitch I'd rather shoot
Got it off the block, off that avenue
