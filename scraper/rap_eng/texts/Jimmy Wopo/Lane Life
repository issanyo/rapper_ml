I woke up like "Lord thank you for the day"
Hit my knees and I pray to my AK (AK)
I put my life up in that AK
Every time the plug threw em, I wasn't a day late
I patrol the block, I patrol the weight
Keep some lil shooters out of Oregon State
She say why you trippin? I'm like bool, bae
[?]
Yeah, chopper get to boxing nigga, Sugar Ray
Niggas taking L's like Cool J
Bitch I'm double L's like Cool J
If Mook was outchea he'd do this shit for Baby Jace
I sent that water up the river, nigga I'm the lake
I sent that water up the river, up the 38's
They said why's you city spinning with that 30K
Cause I done got enough bands to beat a murder case
Mojo got the merch and the Chic-Fil- A
That's them dirty birds, let em fly away
Tint a hundred times in the driveway
Beat the bitch reverse, call it Rice Ray
It's the Lane Mane, 50 Shades of Grey
Shoota's can't wait to shoot the nigga face to face
Lumpa I love ya, I think of ya before I say my grace
Shoot it for ya everyday, I couldn't emit the wait
Momma ask me how much longer I'ma live this way
Over the millions, niggas killing out of [?]
Papi asked how much it'd cost to turn me a snake
I told him I'm a real nigga and I'll remain this way
