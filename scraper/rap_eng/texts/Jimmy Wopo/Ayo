I just wanna know nigga I ain't in my feelings I just wanna know (nigga)
Tomlinese Walking Bomb

[Verse 1]
Ayo I know she ain't just post that shit on Instagram thinking she was cute as hell (She know damn well)
Ayo I know this nigga ain't getting funny postin' pictures with the plug's money (He know damn well)
Ayo You bitches better not call me at 2 in the morning no motherfucking more (Leave me the fuck alone)
I'm chilling with my lady she don't like that shit
I got a hood rat bitch who can take that dick (Whaaa)
I'ma pull up in the truck pick them bitches up drop them off I'ma boss pimpin' I be flipping on them bitches Its time to do a hit, I'ma get up fucking close (Ayoo)
Turn ya fucking brains to Ayo (BANG)

[Chorus]
Trust is the truth Love get you killed (ayo)
They wanna see me dead or in jail (ayo)
You ain't got nothing for my books or my bail (ayo)
You ain't got nothing on my lawyer or appeal
If you think that I'ma snake let me know
If you think that I be playing with my nose
Tell me how you think I'm living
Tell me if you think I told
Tell me face to face you think I sold my soul nigga
(Ayoo)

[Verse 2]
I'm a snake cause you thought I was ya man's when the plan was to rob ya ass (Ayo)
Had his dipper in the picture
On My Momma he ain't have that motherfucker when we caught his ass
Rumors we don't pay attention we just stay alert
Let them place that paperwork we place you on a shirt
L.G.'s off the purp gripping on her skirt
He want her I'ma pay for everything
As long as I can hit it first (Long as I can dog her first) Listening to 2Pac loading up my strap
Run up on me I react with the mac
Judge said fuck me I said fuck you back the because you love the streets they ain't gonna love you back

[Chorus]
Trust is the truth Love get you killed (ayo)
They wanna see me dead or in jail (ayo)
You ain't got nothing for my books or my bail (ayo)
You ain't got nothing on my lawyer or appeal
If you think that I'ma snake let me know
If you think that I be playing with my nose
Tell me how you think I'm living
Tell me if you think I told
Tell me face to face you think I sold my soul
Ayoo
