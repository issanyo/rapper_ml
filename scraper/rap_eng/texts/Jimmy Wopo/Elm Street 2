[Intro]
Lord forgive me for my sins, yeah
Real nigga shit
Stevie on the
(Ayy, Stevie on the muthafuckin beat, bitch)

[Verse 1]
Just to be exact, I was born in ninety-seven (ninety-seven)
So nigga this not crack, it's heroin
But bitch we got the D and C, no Maryland
If a bitch drop a dime I'ma line her, no Carolin'
Nigga watch, they plot, that wire, they wearin'
Pussy niggas be McFadden, like Darren
Niggas talk 'bout robbin' me and Quanie, I'm hearin'
So we ride 'round with these choppers, not caring
Lil nigga ugly but they loving my appearance
Lil nigga outchea really thugging with experience
Sixteen, doin' my thing, outchea fucking niggas' parents
Sixteen, doin' my thing, probably stuck a niggas' parents
RIP Lil Deck, ain't to my left, that ain't right
Thinking 'bout you today whoadie, bring my TEC out tonight
Let it hiccup, wet his chest up, watch him put up a fight
Call up Robbo, he go Rondo when I put up a price
Sneaky face, soup eight, HK in my Nikes
It's been wreck in the 'jects, had to put up the dice
Bitch, we posted, hella toasted off them pills with the pipe
You can call me baby Kobe, bitch, I'm dunking like Mike

[Chorus]
Yeah yeah, ten nine, holler ten when we slide
Eight seven, 'nother nigga on channel eleven
Six five, shoot your ass ten times
Four three, three deep, four heat
Nigga two one, you ain't never shoot none'
Snipers on our shit like we deer huntin'
Ammo gear hunting, semi-auto, switch buttons
I let it hit, talk and spit, that bitch get to fussin'

[Verse 2]
Ooh ooh, Uzi stupid, it shoot two a piece
Chopper make him JuJu on the beat
I got some hitters that be movin' deep
That's them niggas that'll jugg and creep
Got that MAC with them attachments, that bitch shoot repeat
And that bitch got range, I let it shoot from deep
(I let it JJ Reddick)
Ain't been no sellout, been no fake, I ain't been hard to reach
I just do the same shit that niggas do for me

[Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, ten nine, holler ten when we slide
Eight seven, 'nother nigga on channel eleven
Six five, shoot your ass ten times
Four three, three deep, four heat
Nigga two one, you ain't never shoot none'
Snipers on our shit like we deer huntin'
Ammo gear hunting, semi-auto, switch buttons
I let it hit, talk and spit, that bitch get to fussin'
