[Hook]
I told my hitters this winter, man I'm a get me a Rollie
I told my niggas we winners, man I'm a get me a Rover
I told my bitch I'm coming home with a chip on my shoulder
I told my dogs I'm going raw, ain't cutting shit with the soda
I told my mom I'm going all in, we ain't getting no closer
When this probation shit over I tell my niggas to roll up
I told them labels to hold up, man I ain't getting fucked over
Man I swear after this year the whole world gonna know us

[Verse 1]
Man this year I'm killing niggas without picking my pole up
Man this year I'm killing niggas without sending my soldiers
Man probation they hating but it ain't shit to be sober
Plus what I'm sipping don't show up so I tell [?] pour a four up
Ay when I'm under the weather you know that drink'll feel better
I put the 24th ingredient in my Dr. Pepper
I thought I told ya I'm going strong, I want that Rollie this winter
Ain't no more guns in my pictures, these niggas know I'm a hitter
And I ain't gotta remind a nigga, man I know they remember
I wish [?] could see this shit, boy you know that I miss you
Man I swear after this year they gonna know all my niggas
Man I swear after this year they gonna know all my niggas

[Hook]
I told my hitters this winter, man I'm a get me a Rollie

I told my bitch I'm coming home with a chip on my shoulder

I told my mom I'm going all in, we ain't getting no closer
When this probation shit over I tell my niggas to roll up
I told them labels to hold up, man I ain't getting fucked over
Man I swear after this year the whole world gonna know us

[Verse 2]
This that yeah yo you ain't know there we go
This that yeah yo yeah this this year's flow
This that sitting in the cell in the mirror flow
Acting like you held me down, man I dare a ho
I changed my life a year ago, I'm not a criminal
I came from whipping chemicals and serving [?]
But still we on the Hill in the field like a Seminole
Cops on me still, still treat me like an imbecile
Chain white, black, and gold, it ain't a penguin though
Eight Block CEO, Sneak Gang general
I am the hyena, ho, saucing like a pizza roll
Up Chauncey me and [?], bro said we invincible

[Hook]
I told my hitters this winter, man I'm a get me a Rollie
