[Intro]

[Chorus]
Cheezy told me not to rob, said lil bro kick your feet up
Told me stay up on my job, these pussy niggas ain't gon feed us
This not yo shit no Doritos, I take your base, Derek Jeter
I'm that [?] Khalifa, been such a sneaky hyena
I pull up backseat Big Wopo this AR Carbine, no Draco
The backseat windows start droppin
I knock some sauce out your eggroll
If we can't pull up right on him
Lil bro run down screaming "ayo"
This 32 for lil [?], he get him gone with the Franco

[Verse 1]
From the 22 up to the 24 to 25
You can't ride through the drives if we don't know your ride
See lil baby she go brazy, she gone really blow your mind
Soon as you nut and try to slide, I'ma be waitin' right outside
I'm from Sunday to Monday, I'm on a one way
Come stunt or confront me, It's gon be gun play
Some way, free my nigga Top up out that can and-
Lum Way, we'll shoot your right here on these cameras
Get your life tooken, tryna get my ice tooken
I'm right here whippin' work, smell that project chicken cookin'
Put your ass in the sky, you could get your flight bookin'
All us of a couple pills, watch the way you niggas lookin' (gang)
Lane

[Chorus]
Cheezy told me not to rob, said lil bro kick your feet up
Told me stay up on my job, these pussy niggas ain't gon feed us
This not yo shit no Doritos , I take your base, Derek Jeter
I'm that [?] Khalifa, been such a sneaky hyena
I made the city believe us
I make my young niggas leave ya
Check my stats, I'm the leader (bitch, I'm the king)
This Pittsburgh shit, I'm the king of

[Verse 2]
Yeah I take care of my niggas and I give back what I could
I bet we'll all be riding foreign when we get back to the hood
Man these interviews is pitiful, they ask me bout Wiz
Ay, bitch I'm Wopo I can't tell you how another nigga live
I come from hustlers and snaps, servin' my own grandma crack
Ain't it a blessing, never expected to make money off rap
They shut me down at that Mack, I held it down and bounced back
Look at me now, I wear the crown and got the town on my back
Taylor told me keep flame, it's understood so explain
This ain't a diss, I just want niggas put respect on my name
Taylor told me keep flame, it's understood so explain
This ain't a diss, I just want treated like my foot in the game (lane)

[Chorus]
Cheezy told me not to rob, said lil bro kick your feet up
Told me stay up on my job, these pussy niggas ain't gon feed us
This not yo shit no Doritos, I take your base, Derek Jeter
I'm that [?] Khalifa, been such a sneaky hyena
I made the city believe us
I make my young niggas leave ya
Check my stats, I'm the leader (bitch, I'm the king)
This Pittsburgh shit, I'm the king of
