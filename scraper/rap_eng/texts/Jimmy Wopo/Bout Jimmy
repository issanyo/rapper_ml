[Intro]
You know they going crazy 'bout me nigga (hyena)
Don't act like you don't know what you ain't heard out there
I'm a real shooter I done did that
Yeah

[Hook]
On the real I know some niggas kick a door 'bout Jimmy
On the hill I know some niggas kill your folk 'bout Jimmy
Now be for real
Tell me what you niggas know 'bout Jimmy
Them niggas posted by the store, they don't go 'bout Jimmy
Hoe nigga, couple niggas smack their hoe 'bout Jimmy
I heard them bitches out there going blow for blow 'bout Jimmy
They say Jimmy not stingy, he put that dope dick in me
Ask them hoes 'bout Jimmy
These niggas know I hit plenty

[Verse 1]
All them killers posted on that deuce four 'round Jimmy
You know them oowops, them AKs, and them 4 pounds semi
You know the po's on Jimmy
You know them poles round Jimmy
Right on camera, they gon' dump it and reload 'bout Jimmy
So don't go there with me, hoe call me Ricky
Cause I'm black but I'm pretty
I hit your hoe no Jimmy
And catch a ocho Jimmy
And pass a Romo Jimmy
And my mouth on froze with them golds all in it
With this beef shit, Jimmy don't know no limit
My young JB bros up the score last inning
These niggas know I'm with it, these niggas know I live this
They label me to society a young black menace

[Hook]
On the real I know some niggas kick a door 'bout Jimmy
On the hill I know some niggas kill your folk 'bout Jimmy
Now be for real
Tell me what you niggas know 'bout Jimmy
Them niggas posted by the store, they don't go bout Jimmy

[Verse 2]
They like Jimmy, what's the deal, keep it real, what's up? (what up)
Jimmy took the deal with Atlantic or what? (shut up)
Nah chill, I ain't take the deal, they ain't have enough
So I'm still up in that field we gon' keep that on the hush (shhhhh)
Tarzan I wear bananas, hundred round, monkey nuts
Got them hawks from off the sea sealed up, Wilson, Russ
I be fiending just to squeeze it, man I need it, itâ€™s a must
Even if we didn't leave 'em and they always think it's us

[Hook]
On the real I know some niggas kick a door 'bout Jimmy
On the hill I know some niggas kill your folk 'bout Jimmy
Now be for real
Tell me what you niggas know 'bout Jimmy
Them niggas posted by the store they don't go 'bout Jimmy
Hoe nigga, couple niggas smack their hoe 'bout Jimmy
I heard them bitches out there going blow for blow 'bout Jimmy
They say Jimmy not stingy, he put that dope dick in me
Ask them hoes 'bout Jimmy
These niggas know I hit plenty
