[Intro]
I'm big pimpin' right now nigga
I'm big pimpin' right now, where that lean at? Where that lean at? Pass, me that lean?
It's Woponese, you know what that mean, what I mean, big pimpin' nigga
Listen to me nigga
Listen to me
Hear me out

[Verse 1]

One, thirteen, nine-seven when they made a legend
Oh shit he got that chopper, its a one eighty seven
About to blow up on that opps, since the nine eleven
And I'm always on my grind, in the line for seconds
Bitch I do the crime because my lawyer aggressive
Oh and these turned your livers into simple possessions
Ten racks on some straps just for extra protection
Level six on my chest shit I gotta invest in 'em
Cause I done torch niggas down when they toting they weapon
Pull, pull up on a nigga, I ain't ask him no questions
He get a rep from the Tec about some shit he was repping
Catch him in a lobby trying to get to the exit
Walk up on a nigga and I ask for directions
Soon as he looked to left, hit his ass with the FN
Give me the  price if it's right, then his life I'm finessing
Speaking of finessing I finessed the connection
Because he was coming through collecting but I wasn't progressing
I watch my daughter with the carbon, say I'm overprotective
Cruising down Elm Street with my AR-15
No you don't want Jimmy Wop to pop up in your dream
I'm a fucking grave digger and a codeine fiend
I got the sack on these bitches counting Mean Joe Green
Drop kick from the chick, bitch don't step in in the ring
Smiles goofy like he six but a vet with the beam
B-Boolin in the jets got a Tec with the string
I'll leave that ass Red Bull, you gonna definitely get wings
I'm on your head, on that bread like some sesame seeds
RIP JD and nigga free Ja weez
You can't bob and weave these 223's
Swear money Mayweather couldn't even box these
They kick and flip, nigga these Jet Li's
I let 'em fly like butterfly, sting like bees
I got a mission and [?] feeding Grandma B
She wanna do it off the percs, told me bring LGs
They saying Wop about to blow, nigga who you gonna feed?
Nigga my momma and my daughter and my boy Taylor [?]
But wait, nigga hold that, Imma fuck the whole trap
Whole lane boys nigga Imma flood the whole rack
New niggas whack they ain't hotter than my old raps
Niggas think they doing something busting on my old snaps
Fucking all my old hoes, toting all my old straps
Imma have a couple mill still pimpin' shootin' craps
Player I ain't preaching to you, nigga I'm just stating facts
You ain't got that paperwork then you can't say he a rat
I remember way back, eating hot and cold packs
Used to hit the corner store, steal chips and fruit snacks
Be the same nigga from the clubhouse, turn Mickey Mouse
Soon as I see a square round, I just kick him out
Everywhere I go I got a nigga with that chickie out
Treetop piru nigga check my fucking body count

[Outro]

Lane, lane
(Treetop piru nigga check my fucking body count)
Big pimpin'
(Big pimpin' right now)
Woponese
Pimpin right now
(Bullet in my cup and another in my gun)
