[Chorus]
I'm the boss of bosses, I don't work for niggas
Pull up in an Audi with the curtains in it
I'm the boss of bosses, this shit took a minute
VVS' and you know they hittin'
VVS' and you know they hittin'
I'm the boss of bosses, I don't work for niggas
I'm the boss of bosses, this shit took a minute
Pull up in an Audi with the curtains in it

[Verse 1]
I don't do the having bosses, I call hits
Niggas on your name, got your brain in they pockets
So many niggas fame, I done seen get adopted
Like how the fuck your chain say your name but he bought it
All these niggas lames, making shames of they artists
Sign to Muney Lane, split the change, keep the profits
I'm so over sex, with the neck she an ostrich
If I want you checked, spend a check, it's accomplished
My wrist aquafina with the cheese or velveeta
Mojo got the wings with the keys, he Alicia
I'm from 018, we're a gang of hyenas
If you ain't who you claim you get stained for your feature

[Chorus]
I'm the boss of bosses, I don't work for niggas
Pull up in an Audi with the curtains in it
I'm the boss of bosses, this shit took a minute
VVS' and you know they hittin'
VVS' and you know they hittin'
I'm the boss of bosses, I don't work for niggas
I'm the boss of bosses, this shit took a minute
Pull up in an Audi with the curtains in it

[Verse 2]
And I'm with gang, better known as the Lane
Nigga want smoke, he invited
Better quit playin', talk about taking my chain, nigga we startin' a riot
I'm gettin' brain, smoking dope on a plane, rich nigga shout out to pilot
Holdin' that base, my niggas takin' his plate, we from the home of the pirates
Home of the stealers, my young niggas they some killers
But we do the robbin'
Score a pussy nigga, we do the offense, we do the offin', think I'm a target
Try again, skeletons in a closet
[?] I bought it
Put a nigga head straight on the market
Body bag, find his ass in the garbage
Got a bag, then I'm takin' him hostage
See what he costin', see what they offerin'
20 in his back, nigga he [?]
Call Khalifa, need some kush from the doctor
300 deep, niggas come like the spartans
My young nigga catchin' shit like he [?]
I run it back like I'm ballin'
The boss of the bosses

[Chorus]
I'm the boss of bosses, I don't work for niggas
Pull up in an Audi with the curtains in it
I'm the boss of bosses, this shit took a minute
VVS' and you know they hittin'
VVS' and you know they hittin'
I'm the boss of bosses, I don't work for niggas
I'm the boss of bosses, this shit took a minute
Pull up in an Audi with the curtains in it
