[Chorus]
I'm startin' out my day, with a chopper
Then pick up my daughter from my baby mama's
Then I shrimp and steak, Benihana's
Like my birthday, I want cake and a box of condoms
And turn up with my niggas like I never saw them
And pull up on my niggas like I never saw them
I'm startin' out my day, with a chopper
Like my birthday, I want cake and a box of condoms

[Verse 1]
Jimmy home, start checkin' your bitch's phone again
Feel like 2010, all these honkies callin' my phone again
I'm in your backyard again, nigga, no Nickelodeon
Pockets on a hungry chick, niggas is Ethiopians
Left the door cracked for you niggas who still ain't open it
Took the cookie jar out the stove, it got the coke in it
The fans got me showin' my ass, so inappropriate
The Xans got me losin' my stance, no more controllin' it
So I might forget who I smashed or niggas' ho I hit
Still skinny Jimmy, what I look like on some bulky shit?
Still Pretty Ricky, I blow your ho the emoji kiss
Ain't another nigga in my city I need to go against
Now I'm focusin', tryna give lanes and G's hope again
I wrote this shit two weeks in, with no pad or pen
Now who gon' pay rap boy lawyer if I go broke again?
My mama, Mo, and them, Baby Jace, Aubrey you need a win

[Chorus]
I'm startin' out my day, with a chopper
Then pick up my daughter from my baby mama's
Then I shrimp and steak, Benihana's
Like my birthday, I want cake and a box of condoms
And turn up with my niggas like I never saw them
And pull up on my niggas like I never saw them
I'm startin' out my day, with a chopper
Like my birthday, I want cake and a box of condoms

[Verse 2]
Just yesterday I woke up in a jail cell
Came a long way from bustin' down them dope sales
I pray every day we make it off them food stamps
I just wanna watch my lil' brother go to training camp
Run the cheddar up, hit shocks and let the cheese melt
You ain't lose lumber with me, you ain't know how it felt
I asked myself, "How I win with the hand I was dealt?"
It's like I'm puntin' on the court, tryna dunk on the field
Damn, and I got hit with probation violation
You ask me, shit I just think my probation was hatin'
Ride in the city with the calculator calculatin'
19.5 for one, two for the Walter Payton
Free my nigga True, he don't shoot, he fightin' that home invasion
Feds wanna kill me, say I'm guilty by association
VVS' in my charm, chain the color as the Penguins
City gettin' shitted on 'til they treat me like I'm famous

[Chorus]
I'm startin' out my day, with a chopper
Then pick up my daughter from my baby mama's
Then I shrimp and steak, Benihana's
Like my birthday, I want cake and a box of condoms
And turn up with my niggas like I never saw them
And pull up on my niggas like I never saw them
I'm startin' out my day, with a chopper
Like my birthday, I want cake and a box of condoms
