[Intro]
This is what came out of the tape recorder that night when I was listening to the voices
Listen to me
RIP Biggie
Yeah

[Verse]
I ain't 'bout to talk about the crack, 'cause I ain't live through that
This the ten commandments of the trap
Rule number one, be brief on them jacks
Rule number one, you better keep your strap
Rule number two don't be loose with your loot
Rule number two gotta shoot for your crew
Remember this too, don't be sending niggas moves
Shouldn't be in the trap if your ass [?]
Rule number three, don't be jugging where you be
Niggas get greedy, fuck 'round send the police
Rule number four, you know young bull
Your ass better watch that back door
Rule number five, don't be fucking up your grind
Don't get high off your own supply
Rule number six, if you riding with them bricks
Don't be havin' all them chickens in the whip
Rule number seven like you rollin' seven-eleven
What you want what you get, better watch what you sellin'
Every day a bitch arrest, niggas out this bitch tellin'
Nigga want a hundred bricks and he a triple fuckin' felon
Rule number eight, don't be stingy with the plate
Every time I had some food, man all my niggas ate
Rule number nine, don't trust 'em, they get high
Don't front the nigga nothing, count his money every time
Rule number ten, everybody know you got 'em in
Every plug fuckin' with you, they keep coming back again
Put the pressure on them niggas if you feel they really soft
If he fall while we coppin' then my niggas runnin' off
[?] all of that shopping then a nigga getting robbed
Cut the middle man out and go see papi for the raw
