Tell me how you wanna do him, it ain't nothin' to me
I'm a shooter, like a pull up, it's a jumper to me
When I was younger I was dumber, Ty was dumber than me
Even if I whooped a nigga, bro-bro jumped in with me
And even if I cooked a nigga, bro-bro burnt him with me
So when he took me on that mission, yeah I burnt him for free
And yeah I come from out the dungeon, they let youngin' release
My third gun [?] and sold that bitch to RB
That's when the prices was out righteous, it was 80 a B
Bitch that's 400 a piece, honky's come from West V
I never caught a case with weight with base, I'm David Ortiz
I'm on the Drive, I'm the with the [?], that boy on point like Kyrie
That chopper spreadin' on your ass just like it's poison ivy
I'm finna pour me up a four in a McDonald Hi-C
Come to the Lane we want your name, your paperwork and I.D
Bro let the chopper get to boxin' like Muhammad Ali
