Jimmy Wopo:

J.D Swerving no crashing out
I live like Lum
You get finessed and won't know how
Wops & stick extended clips, that shit get loud
Catch my drift he wavy clique he getting drowned
Hold up baby, gun me down (wow Ow)
Off that molly baby wow
I just pass her to my rounds (bow, Bow)
Out that window, and you can meet me rounds if you don't get low
And I don't sale molly I flip dope
Get Oppo off of molly it's aback door
Get Oppo off of molly it's a gun show
Get Oppo off of molly and ya man smoked
Bullet's jumping out this 30 hit ya damn throat
It's F-D-T this 2-2-3 knock off ya Afro
I'm up Chauncy, off of molly where we sell coke
It's F-D-T them 2-2-3 knock off ya Afro

Hook:
In them hallways 24 I don't sale molly I got them o's
Live like Lumb 24
We be off the molly's toting po


Opp Azz Nizzy:

Niggas got me in my bag cause he a clown
Free Richy Bricks he up in 6's wavy downed
You still don't know we toor ya bro, he from the Yown (Yowwwwnnn)
It's fuck the opps you want probs then bust a round
Niggas say I make the block hot, well pussy make me move
Bitch nigga get out my face because fucking up my groove
Nigga get out of place and my hittas gonna up the ooze
They popping them 32's, then we go in and check the news
I'm a killer, bitch I'm Osama
About that money
Grab the 30 then go murk Obama
You's dummy & you dirty you don't got a comma
To busy tricking on these hoes, this money for my momma
Niggas dying you don't even know the answer
Like the south nigga talk he a dancer
Lover boy no fight romancer
Want smoke take lungs like cancer
Gang, Gang fuck O-T-B

Young Boss bitch OG me
Nizzy known to clear the scene like OCD
