[Intro]
Before the rap I was in the booby trap
Dog food, bitch I’ve got the Scooby snacks
Ey, I turn the yay into the crack
Penny cake, I’ve got the Hungry Jacks

[Verse 1 - Kizzi]
Trap back on like a light switch, runnin’ through the D like I’m Mike Vic
[?] from my cocaine go both ways on some dyke shit
I talk heavy, no light shit, nigga we ain’t on that fight shit
We tuck silly, this Glock milly and it’ll pop willy like a bike trip
Plug said that he on his way and he comin’ through with the load nigga
In the kitchen with the bakin’ soda, got the pyrex on the stove nigga
Feds came with indictments then they send us all up the row nigga
Sixty months I had baby mama playin’ with that pussy on the phone nigga
I run shit like a viking nigga, my chain cold as Minnesota
Hell no, we ain’t fightin’ nigga got the shooters with me Villanova
Got the Rollie on and the [?] niggas seen the Chevy or a Toyota
I’m ballin’ out like a titan nigga got a hundred pack in a Rover ha

[Chorus - Jimmy Wopo]
Before the rap I was in the booby trap
Dog food, bitch I’ve got the Scooby snacks
Ey, I turn the yay into the crack
Penny cake, I’ve got the Hungry Jacks
Peek-a-boo, welcome to the booby trap
Achoo, God blessed me with the stacks
Hit my jack, yo I’m at the booby trap
Where you at? Hoe I’m at the booby trap

[Verse 2 - Jimmy Wopo]
Got a new car I’m ridin’ in you know that we’ve spaced up
Got Michael on my sneaks nigga them new J’s they spaced up
Got a new hoe on the backseat, I’m fuckin’ up her make up
Lean in me don’t taste us, I’m bustin’ all over her taste buds
Big two four don’t gun bluff, we shootin’ shit from the face up
My young bull no barber school, he’ll clip your shit no shape up
Fuck your hoe on the lay up, hoe I don’t play for the Lakers
Got Rolie on fuck a [?], this dirty money no paste ups
See young nigga I’ve been plug, I hit the lane and blanca
In the trap house on the first floor, shit everybody knew who I was
Name hot as hell, I was ringin’ bells, before I ever even got a buzz
Chain’ rainin’ like I’ve got a flood, [?] wrapped in pornhub

[Chorus - Jimmy Wopo]
Before the rap I was in the booby trap
Dog food, bitch I’ve got the Scooby snacks
Ey, I turn the yay into the crack
Penny cake, I’ve got the Hungry Jacks
Peek-a-boo, welcome to the booby trap
Achoo, God blessed me with the stacks
Hit my jack, yo I’m at the booby trap
Where you at? Hoe I’m at the booby trap
