[Chorus]
All my life a nigga had to fight
So all my life I been about that life
All my life I had to risk my life
So all my life I ain't been livin' right
Said all my life I wasn't gon' be nobody
I earned my stripes, nigga I made me somebody
No I ain't finna be nobody's body
Nah I ain't finna be no nigga's body
You got me fucked up

[Verse 1]
Say you ain't nobody, you ain't never catch no body nigga
Say you ain't nobody, you ain't never shoot nobody nigga
I'm 'bout that life, I swear to God this ain't no story nigga
I'm off that perky, I can't hit her 'less that molly hit her
I risk my life, that's for my brothers, boy I'm always with you
I put my life up in that chopper, that bitch a story ender
Bitch we'll extort you, high as fuck, get to torturing you
Show him his mama, his big sister, and his baby picture
It's on my skin, on my bones, I'm too hot for bitches
Ain't never die 'bout a thot, don't think about you bitches
It's in my lung, in my soul, so my heart bitter
Don't sugarcoat with these hoes, I ain't no fuck nigga

[Chorus]
All my life a nigga had to fight
So all my life I been about that life
All my life I had to risk my life
So all my life I ain't been livin' right
Said all my life I wasn't gon' be nobody
I earned my stripes, nigga I made me somebody
No I ain't finna be nobody's body
Nah I ain't finna be no nigga's body
You got me fucked up

[Verse 2]
I ain't trippin' 'bout no shooter, I got shows, nigga show out
Pussy niggas scared to come out, could've planned that for a month now
I got shooters that don't come 'round, Rambo ammo, they won't run out
Fuck a bando, this a bustdown, I got bass, no surround sound
With the bass, Nolan on the mound, strike the fiends out
Bitch I'm Tyson with the pills, his ass bite them things down
In the booth with the freestyle, you write them things down
In the coupe with the chopper, it's just me and him

[Chorus]
All my life a nigga had to fight
So all my life I been about that life
All my life I had to risk my life
So all my life I ain't been livin' right
Said all my life I wasn't gon' be nobody
I earned my stripes, nigga I made me somebody
No I ain't finna be nobody's body
Nah I ain't finna be no nigga's body
You got me fucked up
You got me fucked up
