[Intro]
Jordan Kobe
Real nigga, that's on my body
Where was they at?
Everybody callin' my phone man, I don't be pickin' up man

[Chorus]
All these hoes call my phone nigga, and I ain't pickin' up
Where was all these hoes when we was shit out of luck?
Me and Ball was down bad, yeah we was fucked up
Now I'm JD swervin', pull up in a Nissan truck
Back when we was like a hundred niggas, we was too turned up
Milly used to be my shooter, can't believe nigga went button
I would spec your back door, you ain't never catch no cut
Sneak Gang, no trust nigga, I go with my gut

[Verse]
Any nigga ever told, nigga we don't count them homis
Kill a nigga don't fold nigga, that's 'cause I got him
Two times in my chopper if a fuck nigga feel froggy
Free Lane nigga, every time they 'round nigga catch a  newbody
2015, it's showtime, nigga it was cold
I was out here hittin' licks nigga, all on my own
I was out here beefin' with them niggas all on my own
I was shakin' back for them bullets, niggas wasn't callin' my phone
Niggas wouldn't see I was dome, niggas ain't think I was blown
And my teachers fuckin' with the same niggas, wanted to see me gone
Not to mention niggas shot my brother, niggas brought the beef shit home
Niggas throwin' dirt on my name, shit I just can't condone
But nigga I stayed ten toes, nigga I ain't never ever break no code
Nigga I ain't never ever told, same nigga likin' my Instagram post
That be the same nigga broke
Same nigga rob me that be hatin' on the low
Why they want me, I don't know
Feds say I'm the reason niggas get smoked
I ain't never gave 'em no dope, I don't know why these lil niggas on go
Nigga I go dolo, I ain't tryna send for another nigga's dope
Why I don't love these hoes, 'cause they quick to give another nigga throat
Nigga ain't tryna bring smoke, I ain't tryna beef 'cause another nigga owe

[Chorus]
All these hoes call my phone nigga, and I ain't pickin' up
Where was all these hoes when we was shit out of luck?
Me and Ball was down bad, yeah we was fucked up
Now I'm JD swervin', pull up in a Nissan truck
Back when we was like a hundred niggas, we was too turned up
Milly used to be my shooter, can't believe nigga went button
I would spec your back door, you ain't never catch no cut
Sneak Gang, no trust nigga, I go with my gut
