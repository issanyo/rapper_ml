[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
I'm just balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you
And I'm balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you
And I'm balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you

[Verse 1: RiFF RAFF]
Blueberry lean, hit the ceiling fan
I pull up in lamb and the seats candy tan
Check out my sedan
Check my checking and you might get chin checked
Checkers on my heels cause they Louis Vuitton
Filet mignon in Hong Kong
Even if you do me wrong
I still wish you blessings
God bless the adolescence with indigestion
My fifth doing curls
[?] doing bench presses
Who is the bestest
I pull up on the scene

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
I'm just balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you
And I'm just balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you

[Verse 2: Jimmy Wopo]
We all in the kitchen nigga go and help yourself
Whipping in the kitchen think I gave that coco well
Fucking with that water, I swimming Michael Phelps
Always been my niggas, them still my niggas NFL's
No Roger Goodell I'm at the free throw like Shaquille
That my bitch she from Brazil, all the dope boys on her heels
No I don't want a will, I take all my shit to Hell
No I don't want a pill, I take all my shit to [?]
[?] delicious, I'm popping the perc its nutritiousâ€‹
The hollow tips squirt in the trenches
I'm smoking on that futuristic
Oh I can't stay on my pivot
I'm leaning on Scottie, I'm Pippen
I score and Im dishing like Tinsley
I am a dog with the frisbee

[Hook: RiFF RAFF]
I'm just balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you
And I'm balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you
And I'm balling for no reason
And I'm iced out like winter season
I'm just tryna stay away from you
I'm just tryna stay away from you
