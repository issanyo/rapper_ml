[Verse 1: Jimmy Wopo]
Get up on you, put it on you, ain't got do too much
Me and Drama, California, fuck the sushi up
Hella hoes suck me up, I ain't in the mood to fuck
Okay ho, take your time, I ain't in the mood to rush
Yeah, we ran off on them niggas, we ain't have enough
You in traffic, we in traffic, what we linkin' up?
Fourteen, I had my knee, I was lettin' them choppers bust
Now bitch we older, bitch we loaded, we got Toys 'R' Us
Pills all in my system, make me kill him, lord forgive 'em
Off that venom
Fuck 'round whack him, then I ditch him with the nickel
Thirty-eight special, definitely rip through tissue
Nigga swimming with the fishes then I river gang the pistol
This a Jiggy instrumental, ooh kill 'em
Feel that perky kicking in and it's fucking with my rhythm
Fucking with my tempo, block that bitch like Timba
We don't drop no windows, run down in my Timbers

[Hook: Jimmy Wopo]
Ooh, five bands, all blue, ooh ooh
Ooh, move with the loot, loot
Move with the money, money
Move with the money, youngin'
Move with the money, youngin' move with the money
Ooh five bands blue, ooh
Ooh, move with the loot
Move with the money
Youngin' move with the money, yeah
Move with the money, youngin' move with the money

[Verse 2: RiFF RAFF]
Throw 'em in the ocean, San Jose
You gon' have a slumber party with the stingrays
Red carpet kush in my Khalifa cone
Used to cop crookeds from my maricons
My cabrons, my hombres
McDonald's driveway, codeine parfait
Charcoal SKS with the X-Ray
Chapo drive my flatscreen on the highway
Shredded off the lemon, apple ginger denim
What you chase with your vodka? rattlesnake venom
Used to play with them nuggets, Carmelo
Cocaine in my pocket look like marshmallows

[Hook: Jimmy Wopo]
Ooh, five bands, all blue, ooh ooh
Ooh, move with the loot, loot
Move with the money, money
Move with the money, youngin'
Move with the money, youngin' move with the money
Ooh five bands blue, ooh
Ooh, move with the loot
Move with the money
Youngin' move with the money, yeah
Move with the money, youngin' move with the money
