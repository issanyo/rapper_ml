[Intro]
Yeah (yeah), yeah (yeah)
BMG, we in the street
Stevie on the beat

[Chorus]
She ain't bad I ain't payin' shit
She a star, I'ma grant her wish
You ain't starting, you just play the bench
Bench boy, you ain't getting in
You ain't starting, you just playin' the bench
Bench boy, you ain't getting in
Bench boy, you will never win
You ain't starting, you just play the bench

[Verse 1]
I got sack, I got sack on 'em
Dirty money, paparazzi brought the feds with 'em
They be hating, just a little criticism
Kiss my bands baby, I be blowing kisses to 'em
But I ain't paying shit
I ain't sayin' shit
If they ain't a ten, I ain't tryna spend
If she ain't a ten, I ain't tryna spend
Bought a MAC 10, shawty spin bin
Lost a couple friends, I won't do it again
I won't lose again
And I can't stop 'cause time keep running
Who gon' stop me from getting this money?
And I collect it how it coming
Hundred fifty, twenties, fifties, hundreds

[Chorus]
She ain't bad I ain't payin' shit
She a star, I'ma grant her wish
You ain't starting, you just play the bench
Bench boy, you ain't getting in
You ain't starting, you just playin' the bench
Bench boy, you ain't getting in
Bench boy, you will never win
You ain't starting, you just play the bench

[Verse 2]
Bench boy or on the porch
On the streets or on the court
They always trying without support
I came with two, I need a Porsche
I'm a bless em, thank you lord
Explain me like I'm getting divorced
I came from serving, working, dealing
She from twerking, stripping, stealing
I provide her that Brazilian
He keep it one, I keep it a million
I'm the one out of the million
You can't buy this drip from building
Leave you around a hundred cash, can you have that?
I'ma put her to the test, can you pass that?
How you kicking, you ain't flipping, where ya stash at?
If she bad, buy that bag, you can have that

[Chorus]
She ain't bad I ain't payin' shit
She a star, I'ma grant her wish
You ain't starting, you just play the bench
Bench boy, you ain't getting in
You ain't starting, you just playin' the bench
Bench boy, you ain't getting it
Bench boy, you ain't getting in
You ain't starting, you just play the bench
