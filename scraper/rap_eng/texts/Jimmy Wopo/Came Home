[Chorus]
Came home wit' a check
I spent like 4 on my neck
Came home with a tech
I put that all on lil deck
Came home doin' good
There ain't a reason to stress
Came home to the hood
I put that shit on the Nets

[Verse]
I'm on the stoop gonna take one
This not rerun
She watchin' wovies like Morgan
This ain't a Freeman
Watchu gon' do when you blow up?
Put paint and some rims on a Nissan
Got young shootas outta D-1
I got this juice like Capri Sun
I'm in the game like the superdome
Get posted on like Karl Malone
Take down the beef and we eat the bones
You betta run the hyena home
Shittin' on niggas I'm Mr. Jones
Fuck signin' deals I don't need a loan
I'm up so high I'ma need a drone
(Lean got me shinin' in downtown)
First day I spent more bands
On a nigga head before he hit the can
Eatin 'hana soon as I land
Steak and shrimp do the Beni dance
Probation on me so I need the xans
I'm fallin' over can't keep my stance
I'm [?] like fuck durant
I'm on the cheese like a Packers fan
We got the gun from out pakistan
I'm on the chicken no pack of ranch
I pick the bass and it's underhand
With the [?] in my other hand
All this color money in my rubber band
Like young niggas in the soccer van
Banana clips on Tarzans
100 shots in my car band

[Chorus x2]
Came home wit' a check
I spent like 4 on my neck
Came home with a tech
I put that all on lil deck
Came home doin' good
There ain't a reason to stress
Came home to the hood
I put that shit on the Nets
