[Chorus - Jimmy Wopo]
Broke niggas can’t holla
She wanna ball to hold it
Broke niggas can’t rob us
They know we keep [?]
The lame ain’t all us
All us by the dollar
All us dope dealin’
The lame ain’t all us

[Verse 1 - Hardo]
She bad from head to toe I hit that hoe like Richie
She said she want 2-4 I pimped that hoe and did it
Them VVs’s strong on our Rolie baby
I pull up rollin’ stone ‘cause I’m rollin’ baby
Gotten this straight of the dome like I ain’t even wrote
Yo, we been sellin’ dope since I don’t even know
That boy don’t want that broke, then a holy ghost
All my ladies ridin’ like a rollercoaster
And [?] from a lame but all my brother main
Dope trap boy chain wetter like they smelled a rain
Like free my Bo boy Gutro OG Kaddy Cain
From 242 800 [?]

[Chorus - Jimmy Wopo]
Broke niggas can’t holla
She wanna ball to hold it
Broke niggas can’t rob us
They know we keep [?]
The lame ain’t all us
All us by the dollar
All us dope dealin’
The lame ain’t all us

[Verse 2 - Jimmy Wopo]
I just made 20 grand it took me 20 minutes
She sucked me with no hands so less than 20 minutes
You went behind that glass when I was on them visits
I cook it with both hands right in that pyrex vision
I’ve bought the Rolie then I put the diamonds in it
That bitch gonna do what I say just like I’m Sammy nigga
Man, if he hatin’ fuck around I’ll find that nigga
Congratulations, trap and leave [?] nigga
Stackin’ the money, I’m gettin’ it fast
Pushing the foreign with 200 on dash
Right on the corner when you was in class
Wrapped up in porno, I serve you then dash
If we got beef then I’m right on your ass
Gettin’ two fingers so I need a mask
Booked for a show put it right in the stash
Trappin’, these niggas [?]

[Chorus - Jimmy Wopo]
Broke niggas can’t holla
She wanna ball to hold it
Broke niggas can’t rob us
They know we keep [?]
The lame ain’t all us
All us by the dollar
All us dope dealin’
The lame ain’t all us
