[Hook: Jimmy Wopo]
These bitches is overrated
These bitches is irritating
I’m whipping and stripping it naked
Then wrap it in decoration
This is a young nigga world
The world where the young nigga make it
This is a young nigga world
The world where the young nigga make it
Relaxing and marinating
I’m sipping on some of the greatest
This is a young nigga world
The world where the young nigga make it
This is a young nigga’s world
The world where the young nigga make it
This is a young nigga world
The world where the young nigga make it

[Verse 1: Jimmy Wopo]
I put them goons on your ass
I put them goons on your anus
Lil bro, he shoot at your head
Lil nigga tryna ball on Uranus
Young nigga ballin’ with satan
Young nigga pull up with satan
Lil bro owe 18 like he paintin’
Green xannys we poppin’ them planktons
A baby bottle, no blanket
A baby bottle, no blanket
I’m talkin’ ‘bout that Easter pink shit
I’m at your door, trick or treat shit
The plug know just what I’m thinking
Nigga better die, give me a reason
The kitchen and chicken, no season
I’m MVP of the season

[Verse 2: Hardo]
I don’t drink Effen but
This FN plastic
And I’ll shoot it
And I ain’t talkin’ baskets
Bitch I’m the brick man
Not like fantastic
Bringing them sticks man
It’s gon’ be a tragic
The dope in the futon
More powder than newborns
Bitch I’m cut like the Groupon
Bitch I’m hot, you just lukewarm
So much work to put you on
I don’t want you ho, move on
On the salad like croutons
Me and Jimmy, no Neutron
Your man keep on talking
You gon’ be his witness
Nah I don’t own shit
But I’m ‘bout my business
I ride with the hot metal
And I ain’t talking bridges
In LA lifting pounds
And I ain’t talking fitness
In the cut just like stitches
With that rod like I’m fishing
Keep a MAC, Larry Fishman
Just to do ‘em, chopper’s instant
You got robbed, you ridiculous
Never strapped, you like syphilis
Got the racks just like tennis
Getting mouth like a denist
