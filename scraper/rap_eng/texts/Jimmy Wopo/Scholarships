(Hook)
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up while selling these bricks
I go so hard in these trenches
I feel in love with this .40
There ain't a set that can hold me
I make a sell every morning
Trapnati still all in my soul
I still got bricks for the low
I'm selling all of this dough
I'm selling all of this dough

(Bridge)
If I give this nigga a pack or two
All this work that I got you can get a piece
If I can get money in peace
If I can get money in peace
Just sit back and roll up my weed
All of these diamonds on me

(Verse)
I'm right on the crust with that ratchet on me
You already know that I clap it homie
That just why none of these niggas play me
That just why none of these niggas play me
First nigga try me I made a statement
One time for my niggas that didn't make it
Pouring out Henny right on the pavement
Empty out 50 retaliation
Fuck all these bitches I'm tryna get it
Out of the town where I get a interest
Due for a warrant and a couple benches
That's cause I got court and I probably miss it
When we say bricks we ain't talking chickens
Five bundles wrapped its just how we pitch it
65 stacks if you want a pension
I'm talking bout dope that's the way we living

(Hook)
I wake up on a daily basis
I count this money up while selling these bricks
I go so hard in these trenches
I fell in love with this .40
There ain't a set that can hold me
I make a sell every morning
Trapnati still all in my soul
I still got bricks for the low
I'm selling all of this dough
I'm selling all of this dough
I'm selling all of this dough
I'm selling all of this dough

(Verse 2)
I wake up with ice on my soul
Snake out my life got my blood oh so froze
Shame I'm so young letting this money grow old
And not to mention my heart done turned cold
Fuck family don't play with that money you owe
Cause we selling all of this dough
Don't try to take off with my dough
Them killas' be knocking at yo door, cus' we go retarded
Came straight at these niggas like a to be honest
Yea we give out coffins
Ain't know co defendant, you witness this carbine
And I can't recall it
No respect for these niggas cause they got no hunnids'
These bitches be drawing
Expressing your feelings I don't want no conference
They don't want no conflict
Cause they taking off when they see us
Yea they dropping cars when they see us
Girl you so bad that your mom should of beat you
