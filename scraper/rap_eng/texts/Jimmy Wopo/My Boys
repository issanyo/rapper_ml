[Chorus]
Wishin’ mama tell you ‘bout hangin’ with them Bedford Bo boys
You got to finesse the cheque to get the best of my boys
Never forget the set I’m standin’ next to my boys
Philly ‘ceptin’ collections, screamin’ rest to my boys
Yeah yeah I’m blessin’ my boys
Yeah yeah we bet some hot boys
Yeah yeah you know them my boys
Yeah yeah we bet some hot boys

With my mom, baby Doc and J.D. was my boys
We posted up on a A with JT make noise
Runnin’ round and shoot for me with no feet that’s my boy
Tried to run up a cheque then I’m investin’ T Roy

On a lay down on a [?], we flippin’ bricks out of joy
Shootin’ shit out of joy, [?] like Colt McCoy

Wishin’ mama tell you ‘bout hangin’ with them Bedford Bo boys

[Verse 2]
Blessin’ all of my niggas I’m the only thing they’ve got
If I ain’t get it to give them, then you know they’ve got me back

I pull up to with Stevie you know that’s a couple of tracks
[?] need me you know I fuck up a track
I do this for all my niggas that hustle stuck in the trap
Pull up on me, you [?], you know I’m ‘bout to strap
And I ain’t sellin’ no drugs, but still the line and shit tapped
Talkin’ ‘bout all some shit that you know we on
Call me ‘bout some shit that you know we doin’
Call and smuggle some shit that you ain’t blowin’ on
[?] coolin’ on Bedford with a Rolie on

[Chorus]
Wishin’ mama tell you ‘bout hangin’ with them Bedford Bo boys
You got to finesse the cheque to get the best of my boys
Never forget the set I’m standin’ next to my boys
