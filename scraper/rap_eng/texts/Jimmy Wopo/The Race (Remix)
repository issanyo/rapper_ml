[Hook]
Sent my ass to jail, cause I left the state
Got a nigga screaming fuck ACJ
Cause they want a nigga stuck in P.A
If I take the deal, still can't escape
Now I'm riding with Shazier in my K (50!)
Grew up in the projects shooting hoops at the crates
Ayething these niggas do I create
Monkey nuts, out the roof Ju go ape

[Verse]
Turn a pussy nigga Kunta Kinte
Chauncey Drive, free Young Mook and DayDay
Sneaky nigga, I'm a stealer (Steeler) not a snake
Nap a nigga, leave em' laced in Duct Tape
Droppin' hits back to back with the Drac
Aye I'm ballin, I got hard in da paint
City po's, tryna stop all my shows
Cause they can't find out who we knocked out they clothes
Coozy Uzi get you knocked out ya bones
Jimmy Corleone, a young Al Capone
I think that's bro, John Doe, he a unknown
But they can't tell cause niggas stadiumed his dome
And fuck 12, I'm screamin free Max Malone
Shooting cribs is some shit we don't condone
I just wait outside till yo' ass get home
Run up bullets firin till yo casket closed
Sneaky gang, sneaky whol and them get close
Bitch I'm sending blitz, no Dick Lebeau

Sent my ass to jail, cause I left the state
Got a nigga screaming fuck ACJ
Cause they want a nigga stuck in P.A
If I take the deal, still can't escape
Now I'm riding with Shazier in my K (50!)
Grew up in the projects shooting hoops at the crates
Everything these niggas do I create
Monkey nuts, out the roof Ju go ape
