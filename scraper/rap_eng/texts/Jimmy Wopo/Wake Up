[Verse 1]
With the cake, I'm Duncan Hines
Interstate, I-79
NBA, I'm Kobe Bryant
Lemonade, it's country time
NDA, I overgrind
Four zip, I made twenty-five
One attempt like the game tied
A hundred bricks, I'm in overtime
Can't smoke, this sober rhymes
Free smoke like I'm growing mines
Want smoke and I'm blowing mines
I drill a nigga like a combine
Flag a bitch like she offside
Bag a nigga like them pork rinds
F1, I horseride
He tweet to death but he won't slide

[Hook]
I got up out the bed balling
Magic Johnson, woke up in an Aston Martin
And, bitch, I need a red carpet
Cause I'm sauce walking, holster for the [?]
Wake up, I woke up with a bag calling
Wake up, I woke up out the bed balling
Wake up, I woke up with the bag calling
Wake up, I woke up out the bad balling

[Verse 2]
All this money that I'm swimming in like Michael Phelps
All this money, tryna spend this shit, I need some help
Keep fucking 'round like you with the shits, expose yourself
You gon make me whoop your ass with this Gucci belt
That's a seven-hundred dollar ass beating
Got ammo we can blast for a half weekend
Nah, stop squeezing, P.O said I'm not leaving
So I'm always in the hood like I'm Even Stevens
My money misunderstood like Butthead and Beavis
My jewellery blinging, all these bitches wanna eat my penis
Booty fat [?], how the fuck I get to [?]
I call him Owen [?], he go Ike and Tina
All these racks like Vena and that bitch Serena
Got your plan, with that water, he whipped up Katrina
And [?] Weezy ball like Goku, nigga, I'm like Vegeta
And [?], that's like my mom, shout out to Monica

[Hook]
I got up out the bed balling
Magic Johnson, woke up in an Aston Martin
And, bitch, I need a red carpet
Cause I'm sauce walking, hoes can [?]
Wake up, I woke up with a bag calling
Wake up, I woke up out the bed balling
Wake up, I woke up with the bag calling
Wake up, I woke up out the bad balling
