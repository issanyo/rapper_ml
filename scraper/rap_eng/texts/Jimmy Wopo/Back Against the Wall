[Intro]
See who your dogs
You gon' see who send you money and answer them calls
You gon' see who keep it hundred and check on your mom
You gon' see them niggas ridin' when your back 'gainst the
Ayy Stevie killed the beat!

[Chorus]
When your back against the wall you gon' see who your dog
You gon' see who send you money and answer them calls
You gon' see who keep it hundred and check on your mom
You gon' see them niggas ridin' when your back 'gainst the wall
When your back against the wall you gon' see who your dog
You gon' see who send you money and answer them calls
You gon' see who keep it hundred and check on your mom
You gon' see them niggas ridin' when your back 'gainst the wall

[Verse 1]
Sad to say my nigga Cheese, you was right, I was wrong
Shout out to my nigga Cheese always puttin' on them calls
Shout out to my brother Pay for even checked on my mom
I swear to God I shed some tears when I was writing this song
Some niggas thought I knew them for years, I don't know them at all
I talked to Top, I seen his kids, man they gettin' so tall
My niggas dead and gone on bids, man I do this for y'all
Shout out Lil Tay and Baby Rich, man I love 'em like all
Shout out to bae she kept me straight and she stayed on her job
When Jahweezy came home we shot straight to the mall
Watch how I break through the foreign
Kill me, it's making me strong
And shout out me, 'cause nigga I made me a boss

[Chorus]
When your back against the wall you gon' see who your dog
You gon' see who send you money and answer them calls
You gon' see who keep it hundred and check on your mom
You gon' see them niggas ridin' when your back 'gainst the wall
When your back against the wall you gon' see who your dog
You gon' see who send you money and answer them calls
You gon' see who keep it hundred and check on your mom
You gon' see them niggas ridin' when your back 'gainst the wall

[Verse 2]
They only see me went to war with the demons in my nightmares (my bully), let's face fears
Bookin' my for a business trip on TL (huh?)
Yeah, yeah, just ain't fair
Even though I know better, can't just say I ain't care
How I'ma make it out of trouble if a nigga stay here? (huh?)
It's getting chilly in my billies, bands in my Moncler
Yeah I'm getting to a sack like the boy DeMarcus Ware
They be scared when they see me out in public, they just stare
I just whip it, I just whip it in the kitchen, I just stir
Ayy I'm getting to the bread, lemon heads in my ear (bling blaow)
And my back was against the wall nigga, wasn't nobody there (damn)

[Chorus]
When your back against the wall you gon' see who your dog
You gon' see who send you money and answer them calls
You gon' see who keep it hundred and check on your mom
You gon' see them niggas ridin' when your back 'gainst the wall
When your back against the wall you gon' see who your dog
You gon' see who send you money and answer them calls
You gon' see who keep it hundred and check on your mom
You gon' see them niggas ridin' when your back 'gainst the wall
