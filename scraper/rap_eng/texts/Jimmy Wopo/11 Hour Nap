[Chorus]
11 hour nap off the Actavis
I stumble over FedEx packages
It's Ravishing Rick Rude in the matte mint
Black tint, blue wrist
Helicopter pad feels like a windstorm (snow storm)
I could start a snow storm with my chain and charm
Chocolate diamonds ducked off in my ruby rug
Hurricane in my blood, flash flood

[Verse 1]
Red carpet, kush, ashes on floor mats
My words, they didn't pass, don't think ask about that
Don't ask me any questions, should we interact
Madonna does my ad-libs, you do the math
I should have a TV show, theme song on top
I don't FaceTime, you watch screenshots
Damn it's gettin' hot, I pull open the top
Pull up with no roof, diamonds on my tooth
I should have a TV show, theme song on top
I don't FaceTime, you watch screenshots
Damn it's gettin' hot, I pull open the top
Pull up with no roof, diamonds on my tooth

[Chorus]
11 hour nap off the Actavis
I stumble over FedEx packages
It's Ravishing Rick Rude in the matte mint
Black tint, blue wrist
Helicopter pad feels like a windstorm (snow storm)
I could start a snow storm with my chain and charm
Chocolate diamonds ducked off in my ruby rug
Hurricane in my blood, flash flood

[Verse 2]
Feel like I'm rich
This money ain't shit, I might buy me a bitch
Broke out a stick and he let it hit
My niggas stay lit
You don't like me, most likely it's this
Most likely I'm hitting his sis
If I ain't hit, then I get the assist
A lotta hoes, I ain't get to admit
Young niggas turnin' rich off Riff
Young niggas runnin' shit, Emmitt Smith
Fuckin' hoes, doin' shows, me and Riff
On the road, every mission I mix
Couple you niggas got clipped
Wasn't on shit from the get
Be like this as I step on the fence
Broke niggas, they stay on the bench

[Chorus]
11 hour nap off the Actavis
I stumble over FedEx packages
It's Ravishing Rick Rude in the matte mint
Black tint, blue wrist
Helicopter pad feels like a windstorm (snow storm)
I could start a snow storm with my chain and charm
Chocolate diamonds ducked off in my ruby rug
Hurricane in my blood, flash flood

[Verse 3]
Oh check the time on the bust down
Bad bitch, super thick, she's from uptown
Oh, all she wanna do is go up
Uh, pop pills, smoke and drank 'til she throw up
They done got me started
So much ice, jewelry game so retarted
Shawty sayin' she can't take no more of the D
I told her, "You gotta finish what you started"
Big ol' diamonds in my ear, I could barely hear
VIP, they seen them bottles, bet they comin' over here
If they ain't a 9 or a dime, I don't want 'em there
Pints of the Actavis, you know I'm poppin' pills

[Chorus]
11 hour nap off the Actavis
I stumble over FedEx packages
It's Ravishing Rick Rude in the matte tint
Black tint, blue wrist
Helicopter pad feels like a windstorm (snow storm)
I could start a snow storm with my chain and charm
Chocolate diamonds ducked off in my ruby rug
Hurricane in my blood, flash flood
