[Intro]
Uh huh, uh, one thirteen nine seven nigga
A legend was made nigga, uh
Tune the fuck in, turn me up nigga
Lord forgive me for my sins, real shit

[Verse 1]
Out here gang bangin', I was born in the ninties
'Bout eleven, twelve, when I first decided
What the fuck I'ma claim, who the fuck I'ma ride with
Bitch I'm Eight Block for life so I got that shit tatted
T'd up on these niggas like the offensive lineman
Youngin clockin' out, I was putting that time in
Niggas steady hating 'cause they jumped in behind me
I said fuck it, get this money, I'ma kill 'em with kindness
Shit was adding up, now it's starting to minus
Used to shoot it out, it was easy to find us
Now we getting older, it's just homework and science
Before I come up out the crib I gotta peep through the blinds
Rocked jeans and my Nikes, in the 'jects shooting dice
Lil Deck to my left, Top Dawg to my right
Pull up to the light, double cup with some ice
Glock 17, if I don't up it quick 'gainst them, that's my life
In the hood where I'm from you go through shit you don't like
If your daddy was a rat then your ass is a mice
Go get your brother, get your cousin, niggas taking your bike
It's Jimmy Wop, he offed an opp, don't make me do this shit twice

[Chorus]
One, two, make me come up out that roof
Three, four, better watch that back door
Five, six, bitch we finna do a hit
Seven, eight, hundred shots in my AK
Nine, ten, you can't see behind the tint
Lord, forgive me for my sins
Lord, forgive me for my sins
Lord, forgive me for my sins

[Verse 2]
I got niggas throwing bricks for free
I got niggas doing hits for cheap
Make it thunder nigga, OKC
On McScary with my killers nigga, free KD
Used to be my friends now they my enemies
Since elementary knew I'll see penitentiaries
Been a bad lil nigga, no common sense for me
I ain't never had shit up under the Christmas tree
It's a mystery, Scooby Doo
Uzi made 'em do the hula hoop
Choppa make 'em chicken noodle soup
I got some hitters like to toot and boot
Rubber handle, fuck a wrestle, nigga no Farooq
Donkey Kong clips let that banana shoot
On my Pok√©mon shit, I let it peek at you
Spin blocks, spin back again, that shit like deja vu

[Chorus]
One, two, make me come up out that roof
Three, four, better watch that back door
Five, six, bitch we finna do a hit
Seven, eight, hundred shots in my AK
Nine, ten, you can't see behind the tint
Lord, forgive me for my sins
Lord, forgive me for my sins
Lord, forgive me for my sins
