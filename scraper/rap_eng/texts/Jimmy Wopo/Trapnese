[Verse 1: Hardo]
Niggas know that I’m a problem, want me in that cage
Outchea like Saddam, twisting niggas’ shit like braids
Trappin’ trappin’, walking bomb, got your bitch going both ways
She gon’ drink the drip, she gon’ drink the dick, minute maid
Get money on a bad day, we meant knots made
Bricks selling at a fast pace, now they want to raid
I had to shake ‘em off my last case, big O don’t play
That money bag got a bag of chips, nigga Frito-Lay

[Verse 2: Jimmy Wopo]
AK back chopped off
On a hitman mission like James Bond
Hitters like A-Rod
Hit ‘em with the base like baseball
Ho hold on, ho can’t see nothing like Ray Charles
I got the drip sauce
Nigga this is my run like I’m AWOL
Lil bro let the tre off
Lil bro shoot to score, he remind me of Chris Paul
2K, he get crisscrossed
Two K’s out the window, get picked off
Them hollow tips hit hard
Them bullets, I send ‘em like Brett Favre
Put lanes in your front yard
While loaf with the MAC in your backyard

[Verse 3: Hardo]
Nigga that’s back door
What you think I got 30 in the MAC for?
You don’t never bless the streets, you ain’t a trap lord
Every day I’m chasing money, tryna stack more
If you run down it gotta be a sure shot
Finesse the birds if them bitches ain’t a pure flock
So much work I could run it up in full blocks
So much work I be cooking out of four pots
AK-47, got no stock
Cameras on the cribs, you ain’t getting no drop
30 in the shit case you need more shots
I’m just fucking bitches, I don’t love no thots
Baby girl probably ran through your whole family
Last name [?], now this thing hereditary
You sweet, fuck around, that’ll get you buried
Candy man, got hitters on bloody mary

[Verse 4: Jimmy Wopo]
Young nigga ain’t got no manners
Selling the dope out my grandma’s
Orangutan shit hold bananas
Bitch I’m a pit, I’m a panther
I’m in designer, no Panda
Baby girl I understand ya
I’m like AI, I’m the answer
I need a rack for my manor
Busting them bricks like a transfer
Smoking the dope and the cancer
Tru and a Gucci bandana
Ho it’s your knees and [?]
Ain’t tough, he just broke with a temper
Big bro on parole with the [?]
I slap this shit to your [?]
Kidnap him he will not remember

[Hook: Hardo & Jimmy Wopo]
I got a ho in Atlanta
I wrap the snow up like Santa
I pour a four in the Fanta
Out of control with the hammer
Go ask your mama lil nigga
All of my niggas is killers
Police in the city want ban us
No college, we runnin’ them bands up
Broke broke nigga please
Four four, lemon squeeze
Niggas know who got the keys
You ain’t talking trapnese
Bitch I’m trappin’, what you need?
Chopper jumping out my jeans
Trappin’ Hardo, Jimmy G’s
Niggas know it’s Trapnese
