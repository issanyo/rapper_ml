[The-Dream:]
Take it back to the 80's
Dance like this
Take it back to the 80's
Take it back to the 80's

[Christina:]
All I see is diamond rings
Can't get them off my mind like a plane got me flying
This just ain't a fling, it seems I'm trying to take my time
But you make me feel so fine
Tell me whats gotten in to me, never knew this is where'd I be
Spent my whole life living for everyone else
This one time I wanna live for myself

But they telling me its too new (oh oh)
Tell me how long should I wait how long should it take
Telling me its too new (oh oh)
Cause it feels so good just to be your girl
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world

Kiss my check (ooo) for me, finish you what you do
Makes me fall in love with you
Even without the fancy things im thankful for the thought
Boy you got my heart
Dont know whats gotten in to me, never knew this is where'd I be
Spent my whole life living for everyone else
This one time I wanna live for myself

But they telling me its too new (oh oh)
Tell me how long should I wait how long should it take
Telling me its too new (oh oh)
Cause it feels so good just to be your girl
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world

Party like rockstars, dippin' low in fast cars
Ballin' out Cali love down south Atlanta love
Big city open hearts we'll never be apart
We need just to be the part, shorty put a ring on it
Said that im the proto type, yea boy sure your right
Yea boy you know your right
I'm so in love with ya
Debating on it and why you hatin on it
Holla, we making dollas
Oh yea

Dont know whats gotten in to me, never knew this is where'd I be
Spent my whole life living for everyone else
This one time I wanna live for myself

But they telling me its too new (oh oh)
Tell me how long should I wait how long should it take
Telling me its too new (oh oh)
Cause it feels so good just to be your girl
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world, the world, the world
I wouldn't miss it for the world
