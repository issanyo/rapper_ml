[Intro: Shontelle & The-Dream]
Radio killa
Hey,  ey
Ey, let me tell you now
The american dream
Ooh baby

[Verse 1: Shontelle]
Tryna decide, tryna decide if I really wanna go out tonight
I never used to go out without ya', not sure I remember how to
Gonna be late, gonna be late but all my girls gon' have to wait cause I don't know if I like my outfit
I tried everything in my closet

[Hook 1: Shontelle]
Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choo's
Take em all off cause I feel a fool
Tryna dress up when I'm missing you
I'ma step out of this lingerie
Roll up in the mall with something Hanes
In bed I lay in nothing but your t-shirt on
In nothing but your t-shirt on

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Girl I  miss ya, can't wait to kiss ya
Gonna wrap you up in my ar-ar-arms
Adore ya, do anything for ya
I'm gonna work you out as soon as I get home
My baby, my lady, while you're mad
I can only send you texts from my phone
I'm going crazy, that's what you make me
Cause I don't want to go another night alone
I know I'm not u-u-up in the club and you will never hear About me with another girl
Got keys to my heart, you own my love
I'll never, ever, ever, ever give you up
And I can understand why you hate it when I'm gone
Cause I'm so love-sick when I'm on my own
Hold on a sec, I just got your last text

[Hook 2: The-Dream]
Its a picture of you with my t-shirt on
Its a picture with my t-shirt on
And I can't stand to see you with my t-shirt on
I wanna walk through them doors and pull it off
T-shirt on, I can't take it no more I'm coming home

[Bridge 1: Shontelle & The Dream]
Tryna decide, tryna decide
And I'm tryna get by, tryna get by
(Oh I) couldn't even leave my apartment
There's a pain in my heart and I can't stop it

[Hook 1: Shontelle &  The-Dream]
Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choo's
Taking em off cause I feel a fool
Tryna dress up when I'm missing you
I'ma step out of this lingerie
Roll up in the mall with something Hanes
In bed I lay -
Baby

[Bridge 2: Shontelle & The-Dream]
Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
(When I'm not with you)
Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choo's
(Oh-Oh-Oh)
Taking em off cause I feel a fool
Tryna dress up when I'm missing you
(When I miss you)
I'ma step out of this lingerie
(I miss you baby)
Roll up in the mall with something Hanes
(I miss you baby)
In bed I lay
(Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh)
I'm gonna be in bed
With nothing but your t-shirt on

[Outro: Shontelle &  The-Dream]
(Nothing but my t-shirt on)
Said i got nothing but your t-shirt on
(Nothing but my t-shirt on)
Cause I wanna be close to you
(Nothing but your t-shirt on)
(Nothing but my t-shirt on)
I remember when you would like to see me
With nothing but your t-shirt on
(Nothing but my t-shirt on)
(Hey) Nothing but your t-shirt on
(Oooonnnnn)
Let me tell you, no
(Oooonnnnn)
Nothing but your t-shirt on
(Oooonnnnn)
With nothing but your t-shirt on
(Oooonnnnn)
And nothing feels right
With nothing but your t-shirt on
(Oooonnnnn)
Oooonnnnn, oh
