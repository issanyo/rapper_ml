You keep calling me (ca ca calling me) (ca ca ca ca calling me)
But that's O. K. With me
As we proceed... To give you what you need... 2003... It's time for Dream
All the letters that you send
They don't bother me at all
When I'm with my friends
Just feel free to call
And when you keep me up
On the phone at night
You just know that's alright
I'm kinda cool with you stressin' me
It's kinda cool you won't let me be
And it's kinda cool that you're up on me constantly
And I ain't mad that you pagin' me
And I ain't mad that you chasin' me
I don't mind you buggin' me
That's O. K. (that's O. K. With me)
Callin' me, buggin' me
Tugging on my temper
That's ok with me (that's O. K.)
Blowin' up, showin' up
Poppin' up uninvited unexpectably
But that's ok
Ok, yeah
See, you don't make me sick
But I'm sick without you
And you're infatuated
And that's O. K. To hate it
The fact that you won't share me with anybody else
That's ok with me
I'm kinda cool with you stressin' me (ooh kinda cool)
It's kinda cool you won't let me be (ok yeah)
You're up on me constantly Constantly Yeah)
And I ain't mad that you pagin' me
And I ain't mad that you chasin' me
