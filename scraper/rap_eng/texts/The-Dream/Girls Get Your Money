[Hook]
Girls get your money (get your money)
All my girls get your money (get your money)
All my girls get that money
All my girls get that money, that money

[Post-Hook]
I know you wanna get this (Uh-huh)
I know you wanna kiss this (Uh-huh)
You don't wanna miss this (Uh-huh)
You can't resist this (Uh-huh)
I know you wanna touch this (Uh-huh)
I know you wanna love this (Uh-huh)
I know you wanna rub this (Uh-huh)
Cause you was in the thing your wife is (Uh-huh)

[Bridge]
Always wanna holla, but they ain't got no dollars

[Post-Hook]

[Verse 1]
Hands on my hip, all up in the club
The boys tryna fall in love
Always wantin' to take you back to the crib
But never wanna give nothing up
Always talkin' about that ex, and how she only did one thing
Oh, I like a man who spin that cash, so that end me

[Hook]

[Bridge: 4x]

[Pre-Hook]
All my girls get that money
All my girls get that money, that money
