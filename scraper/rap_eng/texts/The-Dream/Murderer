[Hook]
Murderer, murderer, murderer, murderer
Murderer, murderer, murderer, murderer

[Verse 1]
I'm taking back the love you took from me
I'm turning into something you've never seen
And I'ma be the last thing you ever wanna see
I'll become

[Hook]
Murderer, murderer, murderer, murderer
Murderer, murderer, murderer, murderer

[Verse 2]
I'm taking back the hearts you stole from me
And I'm taking back the likes you lifted from me
I'm turning back to mirror your vengeance
I'm coming back to deliver deliverance

[Hook]
Murderer, murderer, murderer, murderer
Murderer, murderer, murderer, murderer
