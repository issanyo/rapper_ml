[Intro]
Whoa, welcome to a day of my life, day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel
Whoa, welcome, welcome, welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel

[Verse 1]
Though the lights were low
I could see you both in a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still, I was frozen right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows just so I could breathe
Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara runnin'
Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you, I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this happen in my own bedroom

[Chorus]
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When I get you back)
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When your heart's been cracked)
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When we fade to black)
How it feels for real

[Post-Chorus]
And you see your whole world collapse
And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh
And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh
And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh right in your face, boy
Betcha gon' know though how it feels

[Verse 2]
So I pulled to the side of the road to fix my face
But I can't cover with make up what my tears want to erase
I wake up in a haze, morning dew and sun rays
As I drive, I hide my eyes behind my black Cavalli Shades
A block from the house slowly creep in the driveway
Tip toe through the door, but you're there wide awake
You're like: "Where you been?"
I'm like: "Sorry, but I fell asleep on Jasmine's sofa
I could've swore that Rae Rae called you and told ya"
You're like: "You okay?"
I'm like: "I'm alright, little sleep and I'll be fine."
But if you only knew what was in the back of my mind
You already stung, but you really gon' find out in time

[Chorus]
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When I get you back)
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When your heart's been cracked)
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
(When we fade to black)
How it feels for real

[Bridge]
This is for real, for real, for real
Oprah Winfrey, whole segment, for real, for real
20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real
60 Minutes, for real

[Outro]
Baby, I had all my trust in you
And look at what you put me through
You got me all crazy
Somewhere down the line, you're gon' get what you deserve
You fucking jerk
You were supposed to save me, my sweet baby
Now we're fading away
But your gonna know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing I ever do
To be continued
