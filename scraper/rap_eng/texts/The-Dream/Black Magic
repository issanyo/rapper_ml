[Chorus]
I might have to put a spell on you
To save us from ourselves and make sure that our dreams come to
I'ma cast a spell on you
That way there's no way I could lose you
Black magic
Black magic

[Verse 1]
I done seen them walk in and out my life
Taken by another man better than me
You know those super pretty guys
That always sweeps 'em off their feet
Yeah you know the ones dumb as all outside
But they can make shit sound so sweet
And all along I thought love is what you can feel
Not just what you see
That's why I don't believe in love at first sight
I believe in love when the mood's right
I believe you can learn to love whoever
We all just need a little luck bringing it together

[Chorus]
I might have to put a spell on you
To save us from ourselves and make sure that our dreams come to
I'ma cast a spell on you
That way there's no way I could lose you
Black magic
Black magic

[Verse 1]
I done seen them walk in and out my life
Taken by another man better than me
You know those super pretty guys
That always sweeps 'em off their feet
Yeah you know the ones dumb as all outside
But they can make shit sound so sweet
And all along I thought love is what you can feel
Not just what you see
That's why I don't believe in love at first sight
I believe in love when the mood's right
I believe you can learn to love whoever
We all just need a little luck bringing it together

[Chorus]
I might have to put a spell on you
To save us from ourselves and make sure that our dreams come to
I'ma cast a spell on you
That way there's no way I could lose you
Black magic
Black magic

[Verse 2]
Who gon' love you in the morning when you ain't lookin' your prettiest?
Love you to your bones, you constantly forgettin' shit
Who gon' love me through it all when I be on that silly shit?
Tell me what it really is when niggas like, "You killin' it!"
On and off the throne, in and out the home
Curse this, my virtues, I never mean to hurt you
And sure I got my principles in tact, but still I'm
A son of Adam and Eve, apples don't fall far from the tree
I love it when I'm under you, girl you know I'm fun to you
Your soul is my religion, your heart is my Sunday
And some of those Sundays I'm missin'
But still I clap back, snap back and you get all of my attention
I wish that there was a way that I could fix it
Dehumanize my eyes, stay focused on my prize, first prize
So I'm in this kitchen mixin' up you and I
That picture of us that you love, blood represented by red dots

[Chorus]
I might have to put a spell on you
To save us from ourselves and make sure that our dreams come to
I'ma cast a spell on you
That way there's no way I could lose you
Black magic
Black magic
