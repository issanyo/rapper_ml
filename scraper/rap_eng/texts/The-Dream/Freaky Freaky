[Intro]
Radio Killa
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Love when the DJ, DJ play my shit, my shit
Like this, like this
I rock, I rock
My hips, my hips

[Verse 1: Naomi & Binkie]
I just called to say
(Boy you know I need you baby)
Makes me feel a way
(Ooh, and I just can't explain it baby)
I just want to see
(If you can come on over baby)
Without you I can't breathe
You got me saying

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
If my body's a club you're my disco ball, ooooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
Tonight I wanna play
Come be my DJ
Now let's get

[Chorus]
Freaky, freaky
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (we gon' get)
Freaky, freaky
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (you know I'm)
Freaky, freaky
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (I know you're)
Freaky, freaky
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus: Binkie]
Love when the DJ, Dj play my shit, my shit
Like this, like this
I rock, I rock
My hips, my hips (you know that I love you, baby)
Then I let it go now, now
Let it go, now, now
Let it go, now, now
You know that I love you baby
(Verse 2)

[Verse 2: Naomi and Binkie]
Hug me, I'm your slave
(You hold me down like shackles, baby)
Sweetie, I'm your prey
(Love how you swoop down and bite me, baby)
I've run out of words to say, so I'm like-
(baby)
Wish I could describe all the ways
You make me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
If my body's a club you're my disco ball, ooooh
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Tonight I wanna play
Come be my DJ
Now let's get

[Chorus]
Freaky, freaky
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (we gon' get)
Freaky, freaky
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (you know I'm)
Freaky, freaky
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (I know you're)
Freaky, freaky
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Love when the DJ, Dj play my shit, my shit
Like this, like this
I rock, I rock
My hips, my hips (you know that I love you, baby)
Then I let it go now, now
Let it go, now, now
Let it go, now, now
You know that I love you baby

[Bridge]
Melting candles flames 'til the edge of the dresser drips
I can feel the electric love at the end of your fingertips
Press me like a flat iron
Keep to me 'til the sun shines
Wake up to the morning dew
I just wanna look at you
While the birds singing
(Tweet, tweet, tweet)

[Chorus]

[Post-Chorus]
