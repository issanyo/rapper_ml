[Hook: The-Dream]
Pour some liquor for my niggas
Just to let you know how much I miss you
I'ma hold it down for the block, triple white Maybach on my 2Pac
Picture me mobbing (x4)

[Verse 1: T.I.]
We riding late night, triple white Maybach on a mission walking off at Magic City
It's gon' be an ass and titty night, city light
Now you front and glare, but I don't care
If you crackin' and [?], we gon' be all above it there
Make sucker raise up and make that bitch raise
Eyebrows I ain't even gonna [mention names?]
Man, I ain't never been is bitch made
You small time nigga, welcome to the big league , homie you passed
Playing tough, no we tenderony(?)
Off a nigga quick and quick to offer testimony
So I stay up about my lonely
They phony, I'm [blodger?] dodging
Sophisticated thug life, see a nigga mobbing

[Hook: The-Dream]
Picture me mobbing
Picture me mobbing
Picture me mobbing
Picture me mobbing

[Verse 2: T.I.]
Pop a bottle pour it out for niggas who ain't with me
Get a bankroll throw it out so ignant niggas listening
Fuck what haters talking bout
Trap nigga fucking with me till the death
I’m the last real nigga left
Young hugh hef, retired nino brown
Graduated into royalty, oh you don’t see no crown?
It don’t matter still they know it’s me
Gangsta gutter poetry
Don’t care what you think, my heart pure I know the Lord see
Out this world officially in orbit
Full of game lame niggas should absorb it
Adversity endured it, he ain't all gorgeous
Just hope they recognize a G when I’m at God's doorstep
Made some bad choices of course but that’s only natural
Now how will you react when the reaper is looking at you
Stacked the dough in my satchel, I’m ballin’ my money long
Shine on ‘em while I’m alive but when I’m gone you can

[Hook: The-Dream]
Picture me mobbing (x4)
Pour some liquor for my niggas
Just to let you know how much I miss you
I'ma hold it down for the block, triple white Maybach on my 2Pac
Picture me....

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I still do it for my thug niggas and my drug dealers
Middle finger to sadiddy bitches who don’t fuck with us
Triple felo ex-con nigga got told on
Just came back on tryna get back on
Ay It wasn’t always bout the rap holme
I still pull up on the street I used to trap on
It’s well known I went from flipping ____ serving
Onto mobbing top down in Rolls down Melrose

[2Pac lyric] – can you see me? is it clear to ya nigga? hahaha
