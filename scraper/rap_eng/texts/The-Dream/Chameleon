I camouflage
I'm a chameleon
I can turn to one into a billion
See, I'm the one
I'm a chameleon
I can be all things to you

I camouflage
I'm a chameleon
I can turn to one, into a billion
See, I'm everything
I'm a chameleon
I can make all dreams come true

I can be anything that you see
Black or white
Like the stripes on a zebra
I can be a gazelle
Chase me, baby
I can be a lion, crazy, baby

I can be up, up
I can be down
Bigger then your city
Smaller than a town
I can be a ghetto bitch
Yup, you love me

I can be suburban
Dinner's in the oven
I can be the biggest in the room
Like an elephant
I can be the quietest
(Shhh)

Irrelevant
I can be a monster
I'm out to get ya
I can be a victim
Oh so, innocent

I can be lost (lost)
I can be found
I can be whatever
I can do whatever
I can break it down and put it back together
BC
Been doing it forever
