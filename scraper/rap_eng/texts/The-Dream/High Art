[Intro: The-Dream]
I'm tired of talkin' 'bout it, let's do it
Girl I'm missin' you like bitches miss my music
And I swear I can't wait to drop yah
Hit your body with that yoppa
Hit your body with that yoppa then get high

[Chorus: The-Dream]
I make love to my girl, then I get high with my niggas
I make love to my girl, then I get high with my niggas
I make love to my girl, then I get high with my niggas
I make love to my girl, then I get high with my niggas

[Verse 1: The-Dream]
My niggas, my niggas, hit my man, he got that purp
My niggas, this dry ass blunt, we gon' make that work

I make love to my girl and I get high with my niggas

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
My niggas, they on that lean, they on that lean

[Verse 3: Jay-Z]
Sky high with Ty Ty
G feezys with Jay Breezy
Casa de Campo with OG
Then I'm back home to my Bey-Bey
Police escorts at the All Star
And the Super Bowl, I don't need a horn
Horn, beep beep, I'm too on
My niggas don't do traffic
How ironic, all we used to do is traffic
Then it was drop me off at my girl's house
At one o'clock, pick me back up
You know she gon' try to train a nigga
Before I step up in the club
Would've drove my own V
She be tryna take a nigga's keys
She know them hoes be on a nigga
She ain't even tryin' let nigga leave
You just wanna be around them nasty bitches, she said
Fuck them hoes, I'm just stuntin' with my niggas, he said

[Chorus: The-Dream]
I make love to my girl, then I get high with my niggas
I make love to my girl, then I get high with my niggas
I make love to my girl, then I get high with my niggas
I make love to my girl, then I get high with my niggas
Burnt up, burn up, burn up
Turnt up, turn up, turn up
I make love to my girl, then I get high with my niggas
I make love to my girl and I get high with my niggas

[Outro: The-Dream]
I make love to my girl
Then I get high with my niggas
I make love to my girl
Then I get high with my niggas
I love her, that's no doubt
Hit that, then smoke out
High with my niggas
I'm on her and she on me
Then we OD like OGs
I get high with my niggas
And she hold me, cause she down for it
And this shit got me paranoid
High with my niggas
My girl and that white girl
And she really on that white girl
She really on that white girl
High with my niggas
