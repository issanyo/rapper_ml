[Verse 1]
We were two little people wrapped up in this big old world
Drifting 'round in space, out of place, just a boy and girl
Then you took my hand and made me a part of you
And I looked in your heart
And saw all my dreams come true

[Pre-Chorus]
You did the impossible (You did the impossible)
You rescued my love
You did the impossible (You did the impossible)
See, I had almost given up

[Chorus]
And now I love you like summer time
Love you like cherry wine
Love you like free money
Like a preacher loves Sunday
Love you like freeze pop
Love you like a milkshake
Love you like a high school girl on a first date
Love you like shootin' stars
Love you like a muscle car
Love you like we're destined
Love you like my lover and my best friend
Yeah, you did the impossible

[Verse 2]
Tonight, I'm gonna need all your attention
Close the door
I wanna do things I probably shouldn't mention
Like a bird, I'mma hum
Those three words "I love you, I love you, I love you"
Freeze the time, let the world go by
If you're mine, say you love me, you love me, you love me
Boy, take my hand and make me a part of you
And the love that you gave to me has pulled me through

[Pre-Chorus]
You did the impossible (You did the impossible)
You rescued my love
Oh, you did the impossible (You did the impossible)
See, I had almost given up

[Chorus 2]
And now I love you like sunsets
Bubble baths on the jet
Love you like Kool Aid
Louis Millionaire shades
Love you like Sugar Daddies
Love like a pimp caddy
Love like a holiday Duncan Hines yellow cake
Love you like it's five am and I'm off work
Love you like Louboutin heels and a miniskirt
Love you like an Asher cut pink and white engagement ring
Love you like laying in the bed
Bumping Jodeci

[Bridge]
And I'm forever your lady
(Laying in the bed, bumping Jodeci)
And I'm forever your lady
(Laying in the bed, bumping Jodeci)
And I'm forever your lady
(Laying in the bed, bumping Jodeci)
And I'm forever your lady
(Laying in the bed, bumping Jodeci)

[Outro]
And I'm forever your lady
Oh, you did the impossible
I'd almost given up
The impossible
