[Verse 1]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
Nixen, Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stocking, say your prayers
Because Santa Claus is coming tonight

[Verse 2]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
He's got a bag filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle, jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed, cover up your head
Because Santa Claus is coming tonight

[Verse 3]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane
He'll come around when the chimes ring out
It's Christmas morning again
Peace on Earth will come to us
If we just follow the light
So let's give thanks to Lord above
Santa Claus comes tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Better watch out, you better not cry
Better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
He's making a list, checking it twice
Going to find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Chorus]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
