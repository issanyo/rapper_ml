(Hoh! Ah!) I hear something saying (Hoh! Ah!)

(Hoh! Ah!)(Well don't you know)
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang

All day long they're singing (Hoh! Ah!)

(Well don't you know)
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang

All day long they work so hard till the sun is going down
Working on the highways and byways and wearing, wearing a frown
You hear they moaning their lives away
Then you hear somebody say

That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang

Can't you hear them singing, mmm (Hoh! Ah!)
I'm going home one of these days
I'm going home, see my woman
Whom I love so dear
But meanwhile I gotta work right here

(Well don't you know)
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, ga-ang
That's the sound of the men
Working on the chain, gang

All day long they're singing, mmm (Hoh! Ah!)
My work is so hard
Give me water
I'm thirsty, my work is so hard
Woah ooo
My work is so hard
