[Verse 1]
It's so sad what we have become
Beautiful days we seem to leave so undone
And I don't know where we will go from here
All I know is that I can't seem to see the sun
Through the sky from here

[Chorus]
Everyone has a finger
But they can't point me to the light
It can't be that hard to find
After all we're so bright

[Verse 2]
I don't know if tomorrow has a day
I don't know if the rays will shine my way again
All I know is that I'm standing in a place where
My future is like the skies of L.A
I don't know if my body can take much more
We are in the line of the richest riches
But my mind seems so poor

[Chorus]
Everyone has a finger
But they can't point me to the light
It can't be that hard to find
After all we're so bright

[Outro]
I see so many visions
But everyone seems out of sight
This is total neglection
Skies of LA
