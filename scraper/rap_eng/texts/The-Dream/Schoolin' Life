[Verse 1]
This is for them 20-somethings
Time really moves fast, you were just sixteen
This is for them 30-something
That didn't turn out exactly how your mom and dad wanted you to be
This is for them 40-something
Well, raise up your glass and laugh like a motherfucker
This is for them 50-something
Hell, you're halfway there, baby, take it to the head

[Refrain]
Mom and dad, tried hide the world
Said the world is just too big for a little girl
Eyes wide open, can't you see?
I had my first heels by the age of 13
Mom and dad, tried hide the boys
I swear, that just make 'em want me more
At 14, they asked what I wanna be
I said, "Baby, 21, so I can get me a drink"

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you something
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, tap, sway, boy out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)

[Verse 2]
This is for them pretty somethings
Living in a fastlane, see you when you crash, babe
This is for them sexy somethings
That body ain't gon' always get you out of everything
This is for them bitter somethings
Stop living in regret, baby, it's not over yet
And this is for them trippin' somethings
That's high on life, baby, put me on your flight

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, babe, but I can teach you something
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, tap, sway, boy out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh (Schoolin’ life)

[Bridge]
You know it costs to be the boss
One day you'll run the town
For now make your life what you decide
Baby, party till the fire marshall's shut this sucker down

[Chorus]
I'm not a teacher, babe,  I can teach you something
Not a preacher, but we can pray if you wanna
Ain't a doctor, but I can make you feel better
But I’m great at writing physical love letters
I'm a freak, all day, all night
Hot, tap, sway, boy out of sight
And I’m crazy, all day, all night
Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
(Who needs a degree when you're schoolin' life?) Uh-oh, uh-oh, whoa-oh-oh

[Outro]
There's not a real way to live this... for real
Just remember stay the realest
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Don't stop running until it's finished
Yeah, yeah
It's up to you, the rest is unwritten
Hey, hey, hey
