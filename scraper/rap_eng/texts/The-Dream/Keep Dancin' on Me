[Verse 1]
Lead me out, on the floor
Bring your body closer
Take it all, give me more
Do me like you're supposed to
Move with me, left and right
Slide your hands over mine
Using all your imagination
Leave everything behind
Take my hand, lay on my face
Feel my heart, drumming
Dark corners, flashing lights
Keep the music coming

[Refrain]
I'm off the Earth, on the stars
I ain't worried about tommorrow
Keep going till the world disappears

[Hook]
Keep dancing on me
Keep dancing on me

[Verse 2]
Take the lead, raise the floor
Take a turn, pass the shadow
Taste the air, touch me there
Lean to me, nothing matters
Tell my ears truthful lies
Honest whispers make me sigh
See me left, see me right
I'm going out (of) my mind
See me smile, make me want to go on and on
I'm in peace and serenity, I'm where I belong

[Refrain]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Hold me, babe
Deep inside your heart
Stay with me one more song
Until my body's melting away, away, away

[Hook x 2]
