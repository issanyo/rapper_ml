[Intro]
Contra, Killa, the American
Dream
Bust a move

[Verse 1]
You got loving on sight
Girl, leave the lights on
I'ma love you through the night
Baby, wait 'til I get home
Puttin' up a fight
But you gotta know it's nothing
I know what I like
Girl, you gotta trust me

[Chorus]
When I say I don't care
That just means I love you
Run away when I'm scared
Girl, you know I love you
Don't you see me right here
I'm telling you I love you
This couldn't be more clear
Babe, I love you
You x8
You x8

[Verse 2]
Why you lookin' so surprised
Girl, you know you got me
It's all in my eyes
How could you doubt me
It's all in your mind
You're more than a night thing
You got me high
Catch me, I'm falling

[Chorus]
When I say I don't care
That just means I love you
Run away when I'm scared
Girl, you know I love you
Don't you see me right here
I'm telling you I love you
This couldn't be more clear
Babe, I love you
You x8
You x8

[Verse 3]
Can you see me from there?
Tell me is it clear, clear, clear?
Cause I can see you from here
And baby it's
Clear, clear, clear

[Bridge]
Hey!
I ain't never had nobody quite like you
I'm in love with every single little thing you do
Baby you're my ecstasy
My affinity
Look at what you've done to me!

[Chorus]
When I say I don't care (I love you, babe)
That just means I love you
Run away when I'm scared
Girl, you know I love you (You know I love you, babe)
Don't you see me right here
I'm telling you I love you
This couldn't be more clear
Babe, I love you

When I say I don't care
That just means I love you (Lovin' you)
Run away when I'm scared
Girl, you know I love you (I'm loving you)
Don't you see me right here
I'm telling you I love you (I'm loving you)
This couldn't be more clear
Don't you know I love you
You x8
You x8
You x8
You x8

[Outro]
Don't you know I love you, babe
Don't you know I love you, babe
Don't you know I love you, babe
