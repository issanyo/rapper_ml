Ever since you went away
Been missing you everyday
What I'd do just to see your face
Should of held you and made you stay
Now I really need somebody
Just to call somebody
But I know I can't go back in time and just make things change
Been waitin on your call but ain't heard a word
Wish I can go back to the way things were
Bet you dont even know how much I miss you baby
You can take this as a lesson learned
Kinda like Usher gotta let that shit burn
Breathe in, Breathe out

I gotta let it go
Even though I can't live without you
Dont wanna lose control
Even though I'm missin everything about ya
And I'm trynna keep my composure
But on the inside it's really killing me
All I can do is just breathe in, breathe out

I gotta let it go
Even though I can't live without you
Don't wanna lose control
Even though I'm missin everything about ya
And I'm trynna keep my composure
But on the inside its really killing me
All I can do is just breathe in

Listen up girls I'ma let y'all know
If you got a good man never let him go
If you really love him betta let him know
Never wait 'til he 'bout to walk out the door
'cause once he leaves, leaves it ain't no runnin back to ya
With the pride of a man he ain't comin back to ya
You can wait on your call but you won't get a word
But you want it to go back to the way they were
Even Kodak couldn't fix this picture
You can take this as a lesson learn
Kinda like Usher gotta let that shit burn (burn)
Breathe in, breathe out. (No doubt in my mind...)

I gotta let it go
Even though I can't live without you
Dont wanna lose control (breathe in, breathe out)
Even though i'm missin everything about ya
And im trynna keep my composure
But on the inside it's really killing me
All I can do is just breathe in, breathe out. (oh)

I gotta let it go
Even though I can't live without you
Don't wanna lose control (breathe in, breathe out)
Even though im missin everything about ya
And im trynna keep my composure
But on the inside its really killing me
All I can do is just breathe in, breathe out

You and me used to be happy can't believe that you'd leave
Won't you come back to me
Now you're gone I'm alone at home I'm wishin you weren't gone
Im so sorry baby
You and me used to be happy can't believe that you'd leave
Won't you come back to me
You and me use to be happy
Come back to me

But on the inside its really killing me
All I can do is just breathe in, breathe out

I gotta let it go
Even though I can't live without you
