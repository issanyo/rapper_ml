[Intro]
You know what you remind me of?
Didn't catch your name, lil' mama
Well I don't know your name, lil' mama
Well, I don't know
I don't know your name, lil' mama
Said, I don't know your name, lil' mama

[Verse 1]
Baby, you wouldn't last a day
In your world
Baby, I wanna be your man
You should be my girl
Baby, ooh, I wanna be your
All you ever talk about
Baby, uh and if you let me in that body
I'ma turn that motherfucker out
Baby, don't make me watch
If I can't ride it
And I didn't catch your name, lil' mama
But I decided

[Hook]
Every time I mention you
I'll say Yamaha, Yamaha, oh Yamaha
That's my little Yamaha, Yamaha, oh Yamaha

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, throw me the key
I'll be the perfect passenger
Don't throw him the key, no
Cause all he'll do is gas you up
Let me freak you on the freeway
And every hour I'll beat into your heart, I'ma push to the max
Police hate us, why?
Cause they never seen a girl with an ass so phat
Baby, don't make me watch
If I can't ride it
And I didn't catch your name, lil' mama
But I decided

[Hook]
Every time I mention you
I'll say Yamaha, Yamaha, oh Yamaha
That reminds me of my Yamaha
Yamaha, oh Yamaha
Every time I mention you
I'll say Yamaha, Yamaha, oh Yamaha
There's nothing quite like you, my baby
Yamaha, Yamaha, oh my Yamaha

[Bridge 1]
Oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Ass so phat, hey
Oh baby, oh baby
Never seen a girl with an ass so phat

[Bridge 2]
Seen a lotta places, been all around the world
A lotta pretty faces, a lotta pretty girls
This one is for you, wherever you're at
Still got ya name tattooed on my back
Still got ya name tattooed on my back
Still got ya name tattooed on my back

[Bridge 3]
Get the clutch and the brake, get this motherfucker running
Me and you, together, girl, they never seen it coming
Clutch, brake, get this motherfucker running
Me, together they ain't never seen it coming

[Bridge 2]
Seen a lotta places, been all around the world
A lotta pretty faces, a lotta pretty girls
This one is for you, wherever you're at
Still got ya name tattooed on my back
Still got ya name tattooed on my back
Still got ya name tattooed on my back

[Bridge 3]
Get the clutch, the brake, get this motherfucker running
Me and you, together, girl, they never seen it coming
Clutch, brake, get this motherfucker running
Me and you, together, girl, they never seen it coming

[Outro]
Clutch, brake, get this motherfucker running
Me and you, together, girl, they never seen us coming
Clutch, brake, get this motherfucker running
Running, running, running, ooh
