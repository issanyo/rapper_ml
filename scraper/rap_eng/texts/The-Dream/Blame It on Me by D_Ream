Well I loved you then and I love you now
A love the best that I knew how
You laughed at me and I went and cried
It hurt so bad I almost died, so bad I almost die singing-
Blame it on, blame it on me
Blame it on, blame it on me, on me
We went jigging in the windy city
Your hair and your clothes looded all so pretty, yeah
It reminded me of a little ditty, and a ditty's a song
Some just clap their hands, yeah, they'll clap their hands as they're singing-
Blame it on, blame it on me
Come on and blame it on, blame it on me, on me
Blame the whole damn thing on me, yeah
You took your time to turn away
You gonna turn your back on me
What can I say to make you stay
Come on and stay with me
Yeah won't you marry me yeah!
Blame it on, blame it on me
Blame it on, blame it on me, on me
Blame it on, blame it on me
Blame it on, blame it on me, on me
Blame the whole damn thing on me, yeah
