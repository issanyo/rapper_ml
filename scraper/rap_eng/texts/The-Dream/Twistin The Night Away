Let me tell you about a place
Somewhere up a New York way
Where the people are so gay
Twisting the night away
Here they have a lot of fun
Putting trouble on the run
Man, you find the old and young
Twisting the night away

They're twisting, twisting
Everybody's feeling great
They're twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night away

Here's a man in evening clothes
How he got here, I don't know, but
Man, you oughta see him go
Twisting the night away
He's dancing with a chick in slacks
She's moving up and back
Oh, man, there ain't nothing like
Twisting the night away

They're twisting, twisting
Everybody's feeling great
They're twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night

Let's twist a while
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
They're twisting the night away

Here's a fella in blue jeans
Dancing with an older queen
Who's dolled up in her diamond rings and
Twisting the night away
Man, you oughta see her go
Twisting to the rock and roll
Here you find the young and old
Twisting the night away

They're twisting, twisting, man
Everybody's feeling great
They're twisting, twisting
They're twisting the night

One more time
Lean up
Lean back
Lean up
Lean back
Watusi
Now fly
Now twist
