Face down, ass up
That's the way we like to
Do you in my Benz truck
Then he call your friends up

Yea, I put it on her
She won't even bring her mans up
Damn bruh
Heard that you need to get them ends up

On her like a poster pimpin'
Yeah, I got her pinned up
Hemmed up
Top to the bottom, get your hands up

Police at my door, knockin'
Beggin' me for more, drop it
Excuse me, Mr. Officer
But what more can your offer her?

Nigga, I ain't trippin'
She can go where ever she like
You'll never catch me slippin'
Nigga, my love game is so tight

And I'll give her whatever she needs
And you can't match a love like mine
It's like tryin' to rob me with a BB gun
But my love gets it poppin' like the Taliban

And you know that I got that fire
That blazin', amazin' hood shit
That bangin' out them head boards, hood shit
And you know this

So baby, girl
She ain't goin' nowhere, partna
She stayin' right here

Baby, girl
I don't know why you lookin'
Can't you see ain't nothin' cookin'?

Baby, girl
Got her wrapped around my finger
Sowed up like a singer

Baby, girl
I make every nigga irrelevant
I'm sex intelligent

Sex intelligent
Know how to work it right
I'm sex intelligent
I know how to work it right

I'm sex intelligent
I know how to work it right
I make every nigga irrelevant
I'm sex intelligent

I'm sex intelligent
I know how to work it right
I'm sex intelligent
I know how to work it right

I'm sex intelligent
I know how to work it right
I make every nigga irrelevant
I'm sex intelligent

What could you be thinkin'?
Don't you know that she's mine?
Better re-think it
I know, I know, I know shawty fine

But she took like a motherfuckin' crook, yeah
Like a ticket I got her booked, yeah
Kinda like a fiend I got shawty hooked, yeah
Earthquake, shawty shook it, yeah

She might even chill at the bar with you for a minute
While she's there with you, she's thinkin' how I hit it
Shawty can't forget it
I bust it down, break it down, blunt raw split it

So baby, girl
She ain't goin' nowhere, partna
She stayin' right here

Baby, girl
I don't know why you lookin'
Can't you see ain't nothin' cookin'?

Baby, girl
Got her wrapped around my finger
Sowed up like a singer

Baby, girl
I make every nigga irrelevant
I'm sex intelligent

Sex intelligent
Know how to work it right
I'm sex intelligent
I know how to work it right

I'm sex intelligent
I know how to work it right
I make every nigga irrelevant
I'm sex intelligent

I'm sex intelligent
I know how to work it right
I'm sex intelligent

Get up in my world
Let me put it on you, girl
Love you, baby
Until I drive you crazy

Know this song is over
But I can't get up off ya
Come on baby, closer
Get up on this coaster

And ride it out, ride it out
Until my theme park closes
Grind it out, grind it out
Until the park reopens

You're the breakfast in my bed
Just give me a little bit
Whatever you had to do is irrelevant

I'm sex intelligent
Yeah, yeah
I'm sex intelligent

Yeah
