[Intro]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah yeah, c'mon
Mmh

[Verse]
She said, "I liked all your pictures
And your left side's your best side, just in case you didn't know"
Hmm-mmh-mmh-mmh
She's from San Francisco
She said, "The West Side is the best side, just in case you didn't know"
Mmh-mmh-mmh-mmh

[Pre-Chorus]
How 'bout you and I waste some time?
And get to know if we can take this thing offline?
Maybe I'll fall for you, oh
Maybe I won't
I can be your everything until everything ain't enough

[Chorus]
She said don't come lookin' for love, love
Don't come lookin' for love, love
She said there's no such thing
There's no worse thing
A lot of light, a little sex
Some regret, that's it
Don't come lookin' for love, love
Don't come lookin' for love

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah (Love)
Don't come lookin' for love
Yeah, yeah (Love)
Don't come lookin' for love
Yeah, yeah (Love)
Don't come lookin' for love
Yeah, yeah (Love)
