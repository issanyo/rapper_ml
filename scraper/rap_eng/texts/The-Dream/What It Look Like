[Intro]
Tell her what it look like
Tell her what it look like
Tell her what it look like
Tell her what it look like

[Chorus]
Shawty, do your thing, she hop up out that Range
These bitches swear you changed, I tell 'em you the same
She just want that good life, she come from the hood life
So if she lookin' back at it, tell her what it look like
Shawty, do your thing, she hop up out that Range
These bitches swear you changed, I tell 'em you the same
She just want that good life, she come from the hood life
So if she lookin' back at it, tell her what it look like

[Verse 1]
Started in the Focus, now you in the Locust
Niggas used to hate on you, now these niggas notice
Girls that was talkin' shit, now them bitches hopeless
Tell me what it tell you, what it tell me is they don't know shit
Shawty, you a baller, baller
A real shot caller, shot caller
Now you wishin' you could call her, call her
She do this shit for all us, all us

[Chorus]
Shawty, do your thing, she hop up out that Range
These bitches swear you changed, I tell 'em you the same
She just want that good life, she come from the hood life
So if she lookin' back at it, tell her what it look like
Shawty, do your thing, she hop up out that Range
These bitches swear you changed, I tell 'em you the same
She just want that good life, she come from the hood life
So if she lookin' back at it, tell her what it look like

[Verse 2]
She bought her some titties and some ass on that ass
It's yours if you bought it, just make sure it's the softest
She used to work at Popeyes, she used to work the window
But now she take her mama and her grandma out to dinner
She still traditional, let her man pay
Even though she got it, she always tryna save
Shawty, you look so damn good
I remember you from back in the hood
Shawty, you so motherfuckin' thick
I saw your ex the other day, that nigga sick

[Chorus]
Shawty, do your thing, she hop up out that Range
These bitches swear you changed, I tell 'em you the same
She just want that good life, she come from the hood life
So if she lookin' back at it, tell her what it look like
Shawty, do your thing, she hop up out that Range
These bitches swear you changed, I tell 'em you the same
She just want that good life, she come from the hood life
So if she lookin' back at it, tell her what it look like

[Outro]
Tell her what it look like
Tell her what it look like
Tell her what it look like
Tell her what it look like
