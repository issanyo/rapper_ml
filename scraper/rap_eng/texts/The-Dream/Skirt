[Intro]
Shake it, shake it

[Verse]
I can do this all night
All those things you like
Got you high as a kite like the way I shake it
Let's get outta here come on
Where's your car? Take me home
Up the stairs, close the door

[Hook]
And then my skirt came down, down, down, down
And then my skirt came down, down, down, down
Down (down), down (down)
Down (down), down (down), shake it
Down (down), down (down)
Down (down), down (down)
And then my skirt came down

[Interlude]
Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on
Let's get out of here, come on

[Chorus]
Tonight be my supernova, take whatever you want
Tonight let me bask in you like rays of the sun
Tonight I'm yours, tonight we're one

[Hook]
And then my skirt came down (down)
Down (down), down (down)
Down (down), down (down)
Down (down), down (down), down (down)
And then my skirt came (down)
Like the way I shake it
Like the way I shake it
Like the way I shake it
Like the way I shake it
Like the way I shake it
Like the way I shake it
Like the, like the, like the
That's why my skirt came
That's why my skirt came
That's why my skirt came down

[Chorus]
Tonight be my supernova take whatever you want
Tonight let me bask in you like rays of the sun
Tonight I'm yours, tonight we're one
