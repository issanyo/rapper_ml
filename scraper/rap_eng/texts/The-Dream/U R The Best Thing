My simple heart will live and learn
I took a chance at the price my soul would burn
Inside my desire

I put the question down on my knees
No pretty thoughts that would satisfy my needs
I need hope, give me hope, yeah

So then I run from home in search of friendships
That wouldn't last 'cos they weren't right not like you

U R the best thing I've ever had
Kind of feeling I've been searching for at last
U R the best thing, see me through
I never thought that any love could be so true
I've found true love, I've found true love

And standing here they passed me by
They were wasted cold and empty deep inside
I would hope, let me die here

And you may ask where are they now
Just look around you, lift your head above the crowd
I know now what I didn't know then, yeah

Made me run from home in search of friendships
That wouldn't last, they weren't right not like you

U R the best thing I've ever had
Kind of feeling I've been searching for at last
U R the best thing, see me through
I never thought that any love could be so true
I've found true love, I've found true love

U R the best thing, U R the best thing
U R the best thing, come see me through
I never thought that any love could be so true
I've found true love, I've found true love
I've found true love
