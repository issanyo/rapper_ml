Leave the world behind
I'll leave the world behind (I need my girl)
I'll leave the world behind
I'll leave the world behind

Radio killa!

She never goes on sale
She always got them nails done
The kind of girl that every man is looking for
Her g-string always match her bra
And she's always worth my mention
Even if other niggas don't pay attention to her
Her smile can unite the world
I'm just mad that she ain't my girl

I'll give back every song I wrote
I'll give back every song I sang
If I could just roll up on you
Slap my barcode on you and check you out in my lane

Shawty priceless
Yep, she priceless
All the money in the world
Couldn't purchase this girl
Don't even ask what the price is
Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless
Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless

No
No she ain't an R&B singer
No, she don't need 10 karats on her finger
No, regular working girl
East coast but she act like a Southern girl
Bobby Brown, Petal lip gloss
Runnin' 'round on her lips 'til I get lost
Real niggas go an' kiss whatever
'Cause I can kiss this bitch forever

I'll give back every song I wrote
I'll give back every song I sang
If I could just roll up on you
Slap my barcode on you and check you out in my lane

Shawty priceless
Yep, she priceless
All the money in the world
Couldn't purchase this girl
Don't even ask what the price is
Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless
Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless

I'll never have the right amount of currency
Even if I hit the lottery in 50 states, baby
And you are the meaning of love
Beyond any diamond I could ever dream of, no pun intended
Girl, my story needs you as the happy ending
And asking you to marry me ain't even enough
I'll need you through nine more lives
Seeing your love eighteen times through my eyes
Yeah, yeah

Shawty priceless
Yep, she priceless
All the money in the world
Couldn't purchase this girl
Don't even ask what the price is
Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless
Priceless, priceless, priceless, priceless

Put your black card up
Shawty, she priceless
Put your Phantom up!
She priceless, yeah
The crib in L.A., or whatever you say
There's not an amount, there's not enough money to count
She's priceless, oh she's priceless
She priceless, she's priceless
She's priceless, shawty priceless

L.O.S.!
