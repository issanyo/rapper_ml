[Verse 1]
Now the DJ is saying this is the end of the night
But I'm just chillin' with you, alright
The DJ's telling me that it's time to go
But I love chillin' with you all night
Standing in the sands of time with you, oh
Holding hands when I'm with you, oh
Shh

[Chorus]
Your love makes me butter
Makes me melt every time I see your purty little face
Your love turns me into butter
I just wanna sit still and pray we never melt away

Just rock with me one more time
Rock with me one more time
Just rock with me one more time
Rock with me one more time

Know that I will never find another better than you
That's what makes this feel so right
Know that you will never find nobody better than me for you
That's what makes me feel alright

Just rock
Just ride

[Verse 2]
There's no gravity when I'm with you
There's a war outside but all I hear are heartbeats
Yours and mine
Baby, you're my ocean
And I'm your shore
Still, we lay motionless
This is for sure
The sunlight through my blinds
That warm feeling in my mind
Makes everything go
Quiet time

[Chorus]
Your love makes me butter
Makes me melt every time I see your purty little face
Your love turns me into butter
I just wanna sit still and pray we never melt away

Just rock with me one more time
Rock with me one more time
Just rock with me one more time
Rock with me one more time

Know that I will never find another better than you
That's what makes this feel so right
Know that you will never find nobody better than me for you
That's what makes me feel alright

Just rock
Just ride
