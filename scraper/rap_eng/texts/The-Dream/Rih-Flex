[Intro]
Rihanna flex
She on her Rihanna flex

[Verse 1]
Savages, vultures and savages
She never fuck with the averages
How do I narrate this?
You'll never marry shit
Falling in love is embarrassing
Y'all was together, now you like where Paris went
Move the Eifell Tower like a magic trick
It was never like you had imagined it
It's disparaging

[Pre-Hook]
First she cut you at the knees
Thought you'd be first
Thought that it couldn't get no worse
Did I hit a nerve?
She brought your body back to earth
Oh, now you that bitch
And she that nigga
Work that plug
Flip them figures
Flip them niggas
Daddy told me good pussy could kill yah

[Hook]
She on a Rihanna flex
And now you need that love
Like you lost something that you never had
It was all that, now it's all bad
That Rihanna flex
Now you can't stand what they're saying about ya
But the one thing you can take from this
It's made a man out ya
Oh that Rihanna flex
We had that one girl, that Rihanna flex
We all had that one girl that had that Rihanna flex

[Verse 2]
Gon' live it up
Gon' live it up, nigga
Gon' hit her up
Gon' hit her up, nigga
Gon' sip it up
Gon' sip it up
She'll never be in love
Never be in love with ya
You all dressed up
Tom Forded up
You all making love
All in the club
Shoulda left that love in the club
When all your love never was enough

[Pre-Hook]
First she cut you at the knees
Thought you'd be first
Thought that it couldn't get no worse
Did I hit a nerve?
She brought your body back to earth
Oh, now you that bitch
And she that nigga
Work that plug
Flip them figures
Flip them niggas
Daddy told me good pussy could kill yah

[Hook]
She on a Rihanna flex
And now you need that love
Like you lost something that you never had
It was all that, now it's all bad
That Rihanna flex
Now you can't stand what they're saying about ya
But the one thing you can take from this
It's made a man out ya
Oh that Rihanna flex
We had that one girl, that Rihanna flex
We all had that one girl that had that Rihanna flex

[Bridge]
Bright lights sound so far
Sit back, let it resonate
Dancing with the dark
Some things you can't renovate
Aiming at the stars
Sit back and let it resonate
Sit back and let it resonate

[Hook]
Oh, oh, she on a Rihanna flex
And now you need that love
Feel like you lost something that you never had
It was all that, now it's all bad
That Rihanna flex
Now you can't stand what they saying about ya
But the one thing you can take from this
It made a man out ya
Oh that Rihanna flex
We had that one girl, that Rihanna flex
We've all had that one girl that had that Rihanna flex
We've all had that one girl that had that Rihanna flex
