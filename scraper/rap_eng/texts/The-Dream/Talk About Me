When we started, i was ever seen
When we parted, now i'm the worst the girl you've met
I don't get it! how could you lie to yourself?
I gave my all to you, i made you my career
When i deserve better,!

[Chorus]
You can play those games
You can try to say them, don't want to blame
(tell the whole story)
And you'll forget to tell that you lied to me
(and it's such a shame)
That you're trying hard to make a fool of me!
(who are you to talk about me?)

It's so hard to believe everything that they say!
I won't talk of; i have respect for what we had and no regrets
No love loss, you can try to lie to yourself
You can hide her and pain you feel inside!
Yeah!

Before you start judging me
Don't forget you said you're loving me!
Now you put me down and call me every night
And i feel so sad for you!

[Chorus]

The truth is said in the dark
We'll come to it (yes it will)
I won't talk! yeah!
Those who know me know the real
What about it?
This is the way things will end
When everybody knows we were best friends!

You can play those games
(you can play those games, oh, oh, oh)
You can try to say that i'm the one to blame
But tell the whole story
Don't forget to tell how you lied to me!
(and it's such a shame)
That you're trying hard to make a fool of me!
(who are you to talk about me?)
You can play those games
You can try to say that i'm the one to blame
Don't forget to tell how you lied to me!
That you're trying hard to make a fool of me!
Until you're making a fool of yourself!
Before you start judging me
Don't forget to say that you're loving me, yeah!
If you wanna stop calling me, don't forget to say
I'm the one you need, yeah!
