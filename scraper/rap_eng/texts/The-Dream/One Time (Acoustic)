[Intro]
Ay ay ay ay ay ay ay, let's go
Me plus you I'mma tell you one time

[Verse 1]
When I met you girl my heart went knock knock
Now them butterflies in my stomach won't stop stop
Even though it's a struggle love is all we got
So we gon' keep keep climbing 'til the mountain top

[Pre-Chorus]
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
My breath is your breath
When you're hurt

[Chorus]
Cause girl you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
Let me tell you one time, girl I love, girl I love you
I'mma tell you one time, girl I love, girl I love you
And I'mma be your number one guy
You'll be my number one girl, always making time for you
I'mma tell you one time, girl I love, girl I love you
I'mma tell you one time, girl I love, girl I love you

You love's so deep, you know that it humbles me
You're by my side, them troubles them not trouble me
Many have called but the chosen is you
Whatever you want shawty I'll give it to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Your world is my world
And my fight is your fight
And my breath is your breath
When you're hurt

[Chorus]
Cause girl you're my one love
My one heart, my one life for sure
