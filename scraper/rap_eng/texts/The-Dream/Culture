She throw her  number threes on I throw my number fours on
Make out in the bathroom then we get our roll on
I'm ready to go I'm by the door she screaming, "hold on"
She look so good and that conclusion may be forgone
We leave le Plaza Athénée and hit the L'Avenue, every waitress here is bad
I had the crab and cabbage she had the same too
Intimidated from the french menu

[Chorus:]
Now let's talk about this culture, culture, culture yea let's talk about the culture
Let me take you out of culture, culture, culture put you in this culture

She order herself riesling, I 'tron up
All under the table out in public acting grown up
Ask for the check, get the car, she said is that Céline?
I didn't know they had a store; I said girl, "what you mean?"
We leave the L'Avenue taking the Merci, she's feeling all randy
Through Gate 43 before Jay and 'Ye hit the stage, ain't livin' too shabby

[Chorus]

Wanna show you everything eyes can see, yeah
Take in this world with me
Oh, we don't have to be where we come from
And this journey just begun

Now I ain't tryna gas you shawty, shawty you just seem perfect
Remind me of Givenchy leathers, flawless diamond, Céline purse
I get paid to talk about it I don't talk about it, then you ain't worth it
Got it? Get it? Good! Get it! Spend it- spend it, we ain't hurting. Naw we ain't perfect
I'm just saying, we still got a lot of ways we can grow
And we ain't perfect, I'm just saying, there's so many places I still wanna go
Take you in tow; wherever, whenever, however, wherever you wanna be
Let's go... You and me living a real-time fantasy
