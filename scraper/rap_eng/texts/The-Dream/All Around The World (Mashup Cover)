[Baby]
And I was like
Baby, baby, baby oh
Baby, baby, baby oh
Baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

You know you love me
I know you care
Just shout whenever
And I'll be there
You want my love
You want my heart
And we would never, ever, ever, be apart

Are we an item?
Girl quit playin'
We're just friends
What are you sayin'?!
Take another look right in my eyes
My first love, broke my heart for the first time

[All Around The World]
And all around the world
People want to be loved
Yeah, all around the world
They're no different than us
And all around the world
People want to be loved
And all around the world
They're no different than us

[Beauty and a Beat]
Body rock, I wanna feel your body rock, eh, eh, eh
Show you off, tonight I wanna show you off, eh, eh, eh
We're gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
Just forget about the world, be young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

And all I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete
And it's all 'bout you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do

[Baby]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Baby, baby, baby oh
Baby, baby, baby oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
(All around the world)
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, oh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine
