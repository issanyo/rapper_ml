[The-Dream: Intro] (DJ Khaled) {Fabolous}
Girl, I'm in love with you baby (This the remix!!!) {'ey Dream}
And I want you to know {This for the girls rockin that shit right?}
That I'm hooked to your body (Def Jam All Stars!!) {Okay}
And I'm tryna be yours {Ice} (Radio Killa!!)

[Ludacris] (DJ Khaled) {girl}
Now she the definition of fine
But I told her that her body looks better with mine, hey! (Radio Killa!!)
Now she the definition of fine
But I told her that her body looks better with mine {I know what you like baby}

[Fabolous - Verse One]
I like the way she rock, her hips, then rocks, and dips
Told her we can take off like rock-et ships
Straight jacket jeans, you look crazy in 'em
The way you +Roc'in+ that, I thought they was Jay-Z denim
Lemme drop a jewel on ya, put a rock in air
Can I call you Nana cause you got that rockin chair
It goes back, and forth, then forth, and back
When I'm on, Patron, or off, the 'Nac
Can't get off, the fact, I'm off, my mack
Goldie probably wouldn't but I would trick, off for that
And I'm sick wit the money I could cough, a stack
I can sneeze, some Gs', so baby let's roll

[Hook: The-Dream]

[Juelz Santana - Verse Two]
Rockin that shit like whoa (Whoa) Look how shorty roll (Roll)
She rockin that shit I'm like look at shorty go (Go)
She rockin to the beat (Beat) She rockin it for me (Me)
And all I can think about is rockin it to sleep (AYYYYYYY!!!!!!!)
Her face is like a model body shape is like a bottle
Girl I wanna hit that more than I wanna hit the lotto (Yep)
She revin me up I got my hand all on my throttle (Yep)
I wanna get on top of her, zoom on the Yamaha
Hittin corners switchin gears zoomin inside of her
And if it taste how it looks, I'm a try to swallow her
Call me Mr. shoe shine baby I'm a polish her
And I'll leave ya spit clean I don't use no polisher
Demolition man tell ya friends I demolish ya
Plus I'm that nigga baby I'm a make ya popular
So get another shot of that Ciroc in ya cause I'm 'gon be rockin ya
Treat ya like the first lady I'll put my Barack in ya

[Rick Ross - Verse Three]
Fresh as a black president - one
Air Force Ones in my Air Force 1 (Obama!)
Is it all a dream? (No) Sorry, my reality
See me rockin that shit is complimentin my salary
Complimentary ballots, total up the tally
Spinnin like it's ballet and I touch the budget barely (BAWSE!)
Seen that girl that holla - (AYE!) Told me that she from the (A!)
So you know I had to (AYE!) Classify my gains

[Ludacris - Verse Four]
Now let me take you to a place far beyond in a whole 'nother galaxy
Travel in your mind explore your sexuality
Melt your imagination and mold it into reality
Your hearts my art gallery girl
Can you feel the pictures that I painted cause all of them are related
Like a mother to a son but none of them overrated
They know others due to one our destiny is to make it
Got to thank you just for sharin your world
It's so real and inspirational oh no reason for thinkin I am incapable
Of takin on the duty of makin you interchangeable
The thought is sensational it's perfect bliss
I'm ready to take the Milky Way to your Hershey's Kiss
You know my tongue's got batteries in it
The bedroom we lose calories in it, and start families in it
And don't worry cause the situation is under control
So let me dive in your heart and swim around in your soul
LUDA!!!!!!!!!!

[The-Dream: Outro]
Taaaaake me I'm yoooours, shawty
As we rock to the left ('EY!) Rock to the right ('EY!)
Lend me your body I'mma rock it all night
Don't leaaaaave us on this floooooor, shawty
The door's to the left and parked on the right
Tell my niggaa holla back, tell your girls goodnight
The way you rockin that up in this club
I swear you gon' make a nigga fall in love
The way you rockin that up in this club
I swear you gon' make a nigga fall in love, love
