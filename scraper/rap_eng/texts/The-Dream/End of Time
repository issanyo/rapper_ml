Come take my hand, I won't let you go
I'll be your friend, I will love you so deeply
I will be the one to kiss you at night
I will love you until the end of time

Love you like crazy, now say you'll never let me go

It's nothing between us but space and time
I'll be your own little star that'll be shining you up
Or your own little universe, make me your girl
