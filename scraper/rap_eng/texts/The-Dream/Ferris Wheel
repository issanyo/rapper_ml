[Verse 1]
I got you
You got me
You should see
We wrapped up in some
Crazy lovin'
I love you
You love me
I hate you
You hate me
Crazy lovin'
Kiss your face
Kiss mine
You can't stand me
Get in line
That crazy lovin'
You got to be insane
To wanna love me
And I've gotta be cray, cray, cray, cray, cray, cray
To consider myself lucky

[Hook]
The fair is in town
We should go right now
Go with what we know right now
I don't know if it'll ever come back again, oh
Lovers and ferris wheels
We take such beautiful stills
We do candy until we're ill
Isn't this how love feels

[Bridge]
Oh big and grand
The lights at night blind us both from everything
Oh when the morning lands
Oh the sunlight brings out everything

[Hook]
The fair is in town
We should go right now
Go with what we know right now
I don't know if it'll ever come back again, oh
Lovers and ferris wheels
We take such beautiful stills
We do candy until we're ill
Isn't this how love feels

[Bridge]
Oh big and grand
The lights at night blind us both from everything
Oh when the morning lands
Oh the sunlight brings out everything

[Hook 2]
Are we the weekend type of lover?
Are we the one year annuals?
Are we the hope we die togethers?
Are the weekend type of lover?
Are we the one year annuals?
Are we the hope we die togethers?

[Outro]
Forever
Amen
Forever
Amen
