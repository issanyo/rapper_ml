[Verse 1: The-Dream]
I'm from where them nigga's always packin'
And never solo whenever I'm up in Magic
Throwing millions got these nigga's Michael jackin'
Shorty, what's happenin'
Started behind that A&P trappin'

[Bridge]
We from Atlanta
Burnin' 'til we high as fuck
Yeah my nigga we from Atlanta
And she burn until she high as fuck

[Hook: Micole]
He's from the A
A little faded, saggin' jeans
[?]
He's from the A

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I'm from the A-town, A-town
Magic City's my playground
20 bricks on a Greyhound
Smoking outta my 8 pounds
Zone 6 is my stomping grounds
In East Atlanta we don't play 'round
Cash in, this is a shakedown
When I smash your girl, she make sounds
Gotta big house with a lake now
All gas and no brake now
Lotta love and a lotta hate
But I know who really who fake now
Started out selling breakdowns
Now CD's and tapes, wow
Now I ain't gotta sell weight
And it feels great that I'm skrate now

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Micole]
He's from where them fly girls with good jobs stay at
Educated, independent women, red [?]
I like gangstas, I like hustlers
Candy-painted whip big wheels with a lotta [?]
He love them strip clubs
He make it rain, I make it rain too
Standin' right beside him
Make her drop it like she's supposed to
Magic City, Onyx, don't forget Diamonds
[?] up in [?]
Rep Atlanta

[Hook]
