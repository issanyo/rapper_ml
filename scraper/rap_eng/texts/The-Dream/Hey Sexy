I know you’re not not gonna sing that song
I know you’re not not gonna sing that song

Seven in the morning
That look in your eyes
Says everything I’m thinking
No need to apologize
Your shadow of a mind
Forgive me, I like sunrise
Bury my body in the pillows
Flying away with my hero

Oh baby
I want that breakfast in bed, suck me til noon
You know I want it, that’s why I’m still on it
Baby
Under you til the sun goes down
From the bed to the dresser, real life special boy bless ya ey

Sexy (sexy) rock me (rock me)
All night long
Hold me to the break of dawn
I love it when you turn me on

Sexy (sexy) rock me (rock me)
All night long
Hold me to the break of dawn
I love it when you turn me on

If you make this last forever, forever
It’s nothing like when we’re together, together
So lift my cells, let me float away in your ocean ay
So far from the shore but I’m sure, slow motion baby

Oh baby
I want that breakfast in bed, suck me til noon
You know I want it, that’s why I’m still on it
Baby
Under you til the sun goes down
From the bed to the dresser, real life special boy bless ya ey

Sexy (sexy) rock me (rock me)
All night long
Hold me to the break of dawn
I love it when you turn me on

Sexy (sexy) rock me (rock me)
All night long
Hold me to the break of dawn
I love it when you turn me on

I know you’re not not gonna sing that song
I know you’re not not gonna sing that song
Gotta sing that song

DJ don’t stop this, bring that back
I’m going round and round like laundry mat
I’m going down til you call me back
You’re going down right after that

Go until our bodies break down
You like how this sounds

Sexy (sexy) rock me (rock me)
All night long
Hold me to the break of dawn
I love it when you turn me on

Sexy (sexy) rock me (rock me)
All night long
Hold me to the break of dawn
I love it when you turn me on

Love me love me love me oh babe
And I’mma love you love you love you all day
Love me love me love me oh babe
And I’mma love you love you love you all day

I know you’re not not gonna sing that song
I know you’re not not gonna sing that song
