[Intro]
The stories of old lovers
That we will never get over

[Hook]
All we can do is compete
With something we'll never see again
Lake Michigan
Drowning in this beautiful but cold idea of love
Lake Michigan
Frozen in this cold idea of love

[Verse 1]
You'll never be hurt like you were the first time, babe
You'll never be loved like you were loved for the first time, babe
You'll never be held like you were held for the first time, babe
And you'll never be touched like you were touched the first time, babe

[Bridge]
Stories of old lovers
That we never get over

[Hook]
All we can do is compete
With something we'll never see again
Lake Michigan
Drowning in this beautiful but cold idea of love
Lake Michigan
Frozen in this cold idea of love

[Verse 2]
And you will never kiss like you kissed that one time, babe
And they can never be missed like you missed that one time, babe
You will never cry like you cried that one time, babe
And no lie will ever feel like that lie the first time, babe

[Bridge]
Stories of old lovers
We never get over

[Outro]
All we can do is compete
With that one thing we'll never see again
Lake Michigan
