[Verse 1]
I know a million things about you
A zillion things you like
I know to never doubt you
And you're only gonna do what you like
I know every allergy
Every cure from A to Zinc
I can fix you

[Chorus]
Well, I've been everything
And anything you needed
If you wanna love me
How I love you
Just love me back
Just love me back

Yeah, you wanna love me
How I love you
Just love me back
Just love me back
What's wrong with that?

[Verse 2]
I know what pisses you off
I know what makes you smile
I know you're low on patience
So I never take a while
I know where you've been
I know where you wanna go
So when it's lookin' left, I go right
So you can never say I've been here before

[Chorus]
Well, I've been everything
And anything you ever needed
If you wanna love me
How I love you
Just love me back, girl
Just love me back, baby

Yeah, you wanna love me
How I love you
Just love me back, girl
Just love me back
What's so hard about that?

[Bridge]
I've been everything
And anything you've ever needed
I've been all things
And even things in between, babe

Where's the love for me
Like I love you
Just love me back

[Chorus/Outro]
If you wanna love me
How I love you
Just love me back
Just love me back
What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
