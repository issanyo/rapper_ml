[Intro]
You don't have to be self-conscious
I got you boo x6

[Verse 1]
I love your eyes in the morning
Even though you beg me not to look your way, yeah
I love your smile in the morning
Even without the gloss, you look fine to me, yeah

[Bridge]
Forget about the world whenever I'm with you
So forget about the world whenever you're with me
If there's something broke then I will fix it
Girl lay in my arms
You will never feel alone

[Pre-Hook]
You don't have to be self-conscious
I love everything about you baby I promise
Don't be hard on yourself
Really there's nothing, that can change the way I feel
I'm for real
If my love could kill

[Hook]
Love (x12)

[Verse 2]
I'mma love your body all night girl
Stop talking about you getting thick and make love to me
I'mma kiss your face all night girl
Going straight for the dimples in your cheeks (even though you hate it)

[Bridge]
Girl forget about the world whenever you with me
If you swear to never front
I swear I'll never leave
And I will keep the secrets, buried deep in me
You will never be alone

[Pre-Hook]
You don't have to be self-conscious
I love everything about you, baby I promise
Don't be hard on yourself
Really there's nothing, that can change the way I feel
I'm for real
If my love could kill

[Hook]
Love (fades out)
