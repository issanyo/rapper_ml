[Verse 1]
Shorty, I really wanted to be everything you needed
(Come on, come on, come on baby)
Who knows what would've happened if you stayed
That, that night with me (Come on, come on, come on baby)
I told you to come and get with me, promise I wouldn't leave you
(Come on, come on, come on baby)
You never thought that he would be the one, one, one
One to deceive you (Come on, come on, come on baby)

[Pre-Hook]
Now it's awful cold in the house he bought you
And I've gotten over living without you
Springtime, summertime, fall-time, winter
And all of our love we had, you're starting to remember

[Hook]
But you was off the game, game
And everything done changed, changed
'Cause now I'm making love to Nikki
And I don't feel bad, and no, I ain't sad
'Cause I been making love to Nikki, uh
He was the one that you ran to, the one you gave your hand to
So don't say you didn't plan to (plan to)
So every time that you think of me, know I been making love to Nikki, love to Nikki, 'cause she loves me back

[Post-Hook]
Oh-whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh, mm-whoa-oh
Mm-whoa-oh, mm-whoa-oh, mm-whoa-oh, mm-whoa-oh
Ooh-whoa-oh, mmm-whoa-oh, mmm-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh
Ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, uh

[Verse 2]
Now everything that he told you when you were with me
You believed it (Come on, come on, come on baby)
Considering the fact that it was you, you were the one
That was cheating (Come on, come on, come on baby)
He told you I was with the girl up in the Palms
We up in the studio, shawty all on my arms
We all up at the bar park throwing back shots of Patr√≥n
My whole life was in your name, what kind of shit were you on?

[Pre-Hook]
But it's awful cold in the house he bought you
And I've gotten over living without you
So springtime, summertime, fall-time, winter
I'm here to leave you with the last thing you'll remember

[Hook]
See you was off the game, but now, everything has changed
Cause I've been making love to Nikki
And no I ain't mad, hell no, I ain't sad
Shawty, I been making love to Nikki, -ikki
He was the one that you ran to, the one you gave your hand to
So don't say you didn't plan to, plan to
And every time that you think of me
Know I been making love to Nikki, love to Nikki

[Post-Hook]
'Cause she loves me back, she loves me back
She loves me back, sh-sh-she loves me back
She loves me, sh-sh-sh-she loves me back
She loves me, she, sh-she loves me back
Sh-she loves me back, she used to love me

[Bridge]
Ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa, ooh-whoa
And now you calling me saying you didn't mean to do me wrong
Oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa oh whoa
You've died in my heart, so go on 'head and live in his arms
My love's out the window
That's if you didn't know, peace up, A town ride out
'Cause I'm sitting in the six-four
Girl as the wind blow, baby all my pride out
When you heart is broken, go on 'head, pick it
Go on 'head, pick it up, go on 'head, suck it up

[Hook]
You was off the game, now everything is changed
I've been making love to Nikki, Nikki, now

[Outro/Transition]
Shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog
Sh-sh-shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog
