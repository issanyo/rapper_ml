Lift off, take flight
I'm living the life
Racing down the boulevard
Under the Vegas lights
Ooh, oh, oh, oh
What a wonderful feeling
I got my hands up to the ceiling
Singing, ooh, oh, oh, oh
Got my hands up in the air
Where we end up, I don't care

Just let me get a little Michael, tonight
Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright
Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye
And some of that Barry White
Some of that Otis that we like
Some of that Sam, sure you're right
Give me that Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack
James Brown, probably all night
Oh yeah, Vegas nights, Vegas nights
Oh yeah, Vegas nights, Vegas nights

I really don't know what I'd do without you, babe
You flip the switch and then I'm on, all night long
And you know I can't sleep without you, babe
'Cause even in the city of lights, I still can't see
But I feel 20-20 when you're with me

I'm in love with you
You're my everything
Wanna be your forever
Baby not just lightning
There's a storm of love that stays, never goes
I'm gonna bottle your light
And then shoot, baby, right

Just let me get a little Michael, tonight
Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright
Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye
And some of that Barry White
Some of that Otis that we like
Some of that Sam, sure you're right
Give me that Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack
James Brown, probably all night
Oh yeah, Vegas nights
Gimmee that, gimme that Vegas nights
Oh yeah, Vegas nights
Gimme that, gimme that Vegas nights

I'm out for the night
We'll keep it going until the sun comes up
We gonna sing and we gonna dance
Shut it down tonight

Just let me get a little Michael, tonight
Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright
Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye
And some of that Barry White
Some of that Otis that we like
Some of that Sam, sure you're right
Give me that Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack
James Brown, probably all night
Just let me get a little Michael, tonight
Get a little Gladys, yeah, alright
Get a little Lionel Richie, Marvin Gaye
And some of that Barry White
Some of that Otis that we like
Some of that Sam, sure you're right
Give me that Aretha Franklin, Roberta Flack
James Brown, probably all night
Oh yeah
