Your blazing sun turned into long cold sweats
After all you've done, I'm not over you yet
I know you heart is out the door
Let me grab my feelings from the floor
And everything's said, and I'll get over you, yeah

I'm just playing, oh baby
Why don't you just please come back
Why don't you just please come back
Why don't you just please come back
I'm begging, baby boy
You don't have to be like that
We don't have to be like that
It don't have to be like that, whoa

[Chorus:]
I can't believe we're through
That bag's a lot of broken glass
What a drag, used to love the sight of you
Now I can't stand the sight of you, whoa
I can't believe you're gone, I'm so hurt
All the love we had, blank stare, like you forgot
I used to love the sight of you
Now I can't stand the sight of you
Can't believe we're through
Can't believe we're through

That amazing smile has been lost for a while
Now everything's a mess, still not one regret
And that heart of gold, when I ask where it's gone you say "I don't know"
Hey, I'm not finished yet, you are my biggest regret

Stop playing, oh baby
Why don't you just please come back
Why don't you just please come back
Why don't you just pelase come back
I'm begging, baby boy
You don't have to be like that
We don't have to be like that
It don't have to be like that, whoa

[Chorus]

I can't believe it's over babe
The journey of my heart is killing me
Breaking me faithfully
The sight is burning my eyes
I thought you would be forever babe
But forever has turned into never babe
How did something good go so bad, so quick, so fast
It went just like that

Yeah, boy, I can't believe we're through
The end
