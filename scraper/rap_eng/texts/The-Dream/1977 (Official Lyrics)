No matter how many things I have
No one will ever love me your way
No matter what love invades my space
One thing's for sure, you won't be replaced

If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
I guess I've got to make this song cry
If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
I guess I've got to make this song cry
It hurts me just to see your name
And that tattoo runs right through my veins
My sister misses you the same
And it hurts me cause I know she just can't say
And what I would give to see your face
Wherever you are, I pray you're safe
Forgive me for my selfish ways
For I know that you're better off these days

Baby I miss you every time it rains
And no matter how bright the sun may shine
It never dries away the pain
Singing ooh oh ooh oh
Singing ooh oh ooh oh

And you're written all over me
So much so I can't believe
Your grandchildren are a sight to see
Everyday they're more of you and less of me
And what a cliche, I know you're here
No fair, I know you're near

No matter how many things I have
No one will ever love me your way
No matter what love invades my space
One thing's for sure, you won't be replaced

Baby I miss you every time it rains
And no matter how bright the sun may shine
It will never dry away this pain
And I'm singing ooh oh ooh oh
And I'm singing ooh oh ooh oh

If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
I guess I've got to make this song cry
If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
I guess I've got to make this song cry

Mama I miss you, every time it rains
No matter how bright the sun may shine
It will never dry away this pain
And I'm singing ooh oh
And I'm singing ooh oh
And I'm singing ooh oh
And I'm singing ooh oh
