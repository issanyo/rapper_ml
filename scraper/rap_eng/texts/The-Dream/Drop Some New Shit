[Intro]
You so motherfuckin' wet right now
I can tell
What you mean how I know?
You're fuckin' wet, bitch, shut up
Let the beat ride, let the beat ride
Let the beat ride
Radio Killa, Radio Killa, Radio Killa

[Verse 1]
You were here and gone
I ain't seen you in a while, damn, I miss your smile
Where have you been? How've you been?
She said, "I been missing that dick on the weekend"
There you go, talkin' 'bout, "Oh shit"
In a car, ride by, nigga playin' my old shit
Bitch, you like, "You need to make somethin' new right now"
And I know this
"Stop holding out," they said, "You need to stop holding out"
Yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, she said, "When you gon' play that shit for me?"
Oh, "Boy, you ain't been yourself lately
I remember when we both were so free
That was back then when you used to fuck me
Boy, your shit used to go so hard
Then we would go hard
Then you stop fuckin' with me"
She said, "That's when you used to love me"

[Verse 2]
Not for them, not for her, not for him
But at least drop some new shit for me
You need somethin' you can fuck to (I know)
Remind me why I loved you (I know)
Somethin' I can dance to (I know)
Get my fuckin' dance on (I know)
Get my second chance
And not just another fuckin' love song (I know)
Something she can hit the mirror with (I know)
Full body in the nude (I know)
Why you took so long? (I know)
Girl, I love you, too

[Chorus]
Oh, she said, "When you gon' play that shit for me?"
Oh, "Boy, you ain't been yourself lately
I remember when we both were so free
That was back then when you used to fuck me
Boy, your shit used to go so hard
Then we would go hard
Then you stop fuckin' with me"
She said, "That's when you used to love me"

[Outro]
Sorry I took so long
I just stood by, watching you, side eye
I know you thought he'd take my place
Old friend, see you been missin' that dick on the weekend
There I go, talkin' 'bout, "Oh shit"
