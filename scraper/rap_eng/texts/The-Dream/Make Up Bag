[Verse 1: The-Dream]
She madder than a motha fucka
Cause shawty badder than a motha fucka
It's 2 in the morning

She saying sorry won't get it
So sorry can't hit it
Cause she don't wanna hear me (hear me)
Don't wanna be near me (near me)
And shes in the right
Cause I got makeup all on my collar
Chanel number 5, is all on my shirt but I ain't even holler
She cussing me out with nothing but her panties on
Gon spend all night alone but its gone be fine cause this works every time
