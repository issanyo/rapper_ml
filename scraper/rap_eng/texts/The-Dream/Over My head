Only had 5 mins to write hope you like

Woah yeah let's gets this started so I may like you but to you it's just a dream only our eyes can seee just you and me feeling the Chemistry

Maybe I'm Over my head and our love is dead but I for some reason I  want you back nothing more then that what's up with that I miss you and that's the fact if only you would believe that

Oh oh uh oh oh oh uh oh oh over my head I'm messsing up up up gonna tell you what I want you back if only you were here with me to see the real me

Oh I maybe over my head over the fact that our love is dead uh oh and I maybe crazy but I like the games that you play but just call me what you want anyway

Oh I'm over my head and I need to face it you aren't coming back but I'm fighting for you anyway ,fighting for you anyway

Banging my head on the wall over the fact that your gone uh oh oh oh but I will always want you anyway
