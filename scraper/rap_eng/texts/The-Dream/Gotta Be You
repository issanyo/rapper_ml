Turns the lights down low
Turns the lights down low
(Turn low)
Turns the lights down low
Turns the lights down low

Everytime there's a breakup
I feel wake up
Everybody knows but
I feel the pain but
Y'all don't really know about
How this should be doing down
Be the biggest talk in town
The rumours going round

Everybody wanna love
Cos what their game does
I be just wanting to find somebody with the same 'cos
I can make ya'll understand me
I know some of ya'll gotta feel me

I been around the world
Just trying to be your girl
I still lost you, lost you
(And I know it's not because of me)
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I said
Ooh it's gotta be you, be you, be you, be you
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I said
Ooh it's gotta be you, be you, be you, be you

I'm not making this up
To clear mistakes up
You're the one to blow it up
Saying I'm doing too much
Why he kept that safe key
Look at how you're playing me
Betraying me
And this image of what you made me
And now you're talking this stuff
Think are getting desperate
Newsweek, you would day to day look at Mutya
You can't ever even really know me
Cos my ass is the only thing you'll see

I been around the world
(Been around the world)
Just trying to be your girl
(Trying to be your girl)
I still lost you, lost you
(And I know it's not because of me)
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I said
Ooh it's gotta be you, be you, be you, be you
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I said
Ooh it's gotta be you, be you, be you, be you

Mmm, mmm, mmm
Everybody makes mistakes sometimes
Mmm, mmm, mmm
My mistake just happens to be you
Mmm, mmm, mmm
I don't have to live with regrets
Mmm, mmm, mmm
And I should have known all along
Mmm, mmm, mmm
It was always you

It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I said
Ooh it's gotta be you, be you, be you, be you
It ain't me, it ain't me, it ain't me
I said
Ooh it's gotta be you, be you, be you, be you

It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)
It's you
(You)

(Yeah)
