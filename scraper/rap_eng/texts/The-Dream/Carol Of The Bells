[Chorus 1]
Ding, Dong

Ding, Dong

Ding, Dong

Ding, Dong

[Chorus 2]
Hark! how the bells
Sweet silver bells
All seem to say
"Throw cares away"
Christmas is here
Bringing good cheer
To young and old
Meek and the bold

[Chorus 3]
Ding, dong, ding, dong
That is their song
With joyful ring
All caroling
One seems to hear
Words of good cheer
From everywhere
Filling the air

[Chorus 4]
Oh how they pound
Raising the sound
O'er hill and dale
Telling their tale
Gaily they ring
While people sing
Songs of good cheer
Christmas is here
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas
Merry, merry, merry, merry Christmas

[Chorus 5[
On, on they send
Without end
Their joyful tone
To every home

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]

[Chorus 5]

[Percussion]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]

[Chorus 5]
