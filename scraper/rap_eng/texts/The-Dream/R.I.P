[Chorus: Rita Ora]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she's over
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer

[Verse 1: Tinie Tempah & Rita Ora]
Uh, sexy senorita, I feel your aura
Jump out that fucking motor
Get in my flying saucer
I make you call me daddy even though you ain't my daughter
Baby, I ain't talkin' books when I say that I can take you across the borders
I'm young and free, I'm London G
I'm tongue in cheek, so baby gimme some tongue in cheek
Slow and steady for me go on like a jezzy for me
And say the word as soon as your ready for me
I’m ready for ya

[Verse 2: Rita Ora]
Hit ‘em all, switch it up
Put 'em on, zip it up
Let my perfume, soak into your sweater
You say you’ll be here soon, sooner the better
No option for her, you sayin’ no
I run this game, just play your role
Follow my lead, whatchu waitin’ for?
Thought it over and decided tonight is your night

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel my heart is beating

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she’s over
(I, I, I'm ready for ya)
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer
(I, I, I'm ready for ya)

[Verse 2: Rita Ora]
Nothin’ on, I strut around
I do it big, I shut it down
I wonder if you’d be able to handle me
Mental picture, no cameras please

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel my heart is beating

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
Baby, she’s over
(I, I, I'm ready for ya)
I decided to give you all of me
Baby, come closer
Baby, come closer
(I, I, I'm ready for ya)

[Bridge: Rita Ora]
Yeah I hear you talkin'
Don't know who your trying to flatter
Got my mind made up
I-I-I'm ready for ya'
I'm in control, but with you being a man
You don't seem to understand
I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
I-I-I'm ready for ya
So keep thinking you the man cause it's all part of my plan
I-I-I'm ready for ya

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
Can you feel my heart is beating
Can you feel my heart is beating

[Partial Chorus: Rita Ora]
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see
Her days are over
