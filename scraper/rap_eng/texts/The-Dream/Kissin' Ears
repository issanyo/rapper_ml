Baby girl we ain't got to move to fast
First and foremost I'm a gentlemen with class
Not the least bit concerned with what happened in your past
And I'm sure you're hearts hurtin but the pain won't last
I can be your aspirin, ask a friend too
We start you off with a daily dose of vitamin me
Yeah I got jokes, you laughing at them tho
Now go on and grab your coat and tell your girlfriends that you leavin' them

Show me baby
What you got
Show me baby
Your favorite spot
And I can take you out of here
Can put your love in the atmosphere

Show me what you want and I got that
Tell me what you need and you got that
I wanna make her press that ass on me
Before we get to that

It starts with kissin' ears
Making babies buy you a mercedies girl
It starts with kissin' ears
Getting married being willing to share it girl
It starts with kissin' ears
Get to know me, pickin up groceries girl
It starts with kissin' ears
Paying the bills giving ya thrills
It starts with kissin' ears

It starts with kissin' ears
It starts with kissin' ears
Now let me kiss you on your hot spot

Far be it ok for me to kiss you on the first date
Our lips are like legos and its getting kind of late
You ain't got to eat the bait all I want is a chance
To fish and gettin nervous cause the pond is drying fast
You lying if you say I'm the type of guy that youre used to
Hilltop suite in st. loucia
Supposed again so I could kiss you
Or maybe just wisper, something real man-ish
You didn't know I knew spanish. Did you?

Show me what you want and I got that
Tell me what you need and you got that

Say the word its over
Secure you like a soldier
Before we get to that
It starts with kissing ears

It starts with kissin' ears
Making babies buy you a mercedies girl
It starts with kissin' ears
Getting married being willing to share it girl
It starts with kissin' ears
Get to know me, pickin up groceries girl
It starts with kissin' ears
Paying the bills giving ya thrills
It starts with kissin' ears

It starts with kissing ears
It starts with kissing ears

Now let me kiss you in your hot spot
All night long
Can you sing my song
We can start right here
Starts with kissing ears

Show me what you want and I got that
Kissing ears

Kissing ears

Them other dudes... please you know I'm not that
