(la, la, la, la)
(la, la, la, la)

[Dream]
Boy I know you're a bit unsure
Though I wanna let you know
That you got me baby I'm all yours
Gotta have you around
I don't wanna do without you here
If you still don't get the picture

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs - 2X
I'm crazy about you
And I, I gotta have you
Cause I like the way you're making me feel
Boy for real
(la la la la la la)

[Dream]
Can't wait to be alone with you
Heart is racing when you look at me, baby
If I could I would wanna feel this way for good
You don't know just what you do to me
Baby I got to be with you

[Chorus]

[Dream]
I hope you really understand (me)
Can't make it hard for you to (see)
That we, uh huh (are meant to be together)
So before I let you (go)
There's something I think you should (know)
That you, you got my heart saying

[Loon] (P. Diddy)
Uh yeah, check it out Loon
Yo, I'm young Marcus a.k.a. Harlem night
Good mornin ma, heard you had a long flight
You look so good, prettier than sunshine (that's right)
Girl you's a goldmine, wifey and the whole nine
You captivated my mind first time I met you
And Lord knows I ain't got time to sweat you
But you look crazy in that new Mercedes
And baby I can't act like shit don't phase me
Cause I tried to fight it
Tried to conceal and hide it
Tried no matter what girl I can't deny it
I'm just a fool for your love, cool at the club
I just wanna move smooth, like I'm cruisin on dubs
I'm a grown man ma, I choose who I love (c'mon)
I choose who I hug, choose who I usually rub (let's go)
For other chicks I don't usually bug (c'mon)
If you wanna know the reason why I choose you because
You got me crazy

[Chorus] - repeated several times until end

[P. Diddy - talking over Chorus and until the end]
You got me crazy, yeah
Break it down, c'mon
Dream, 2003
Bad Boy baby, let's go
C'mon, that's right
Yeah, I like this
