[Verse 1]
Head Back
Eyes Closed
Deep breath
Let go
Bare with me
I'll take good care
I'm an expert
Other girls just can't compare
I'm highly recommended
Don't need a second opinion
You'll be all better (baby once I'm finished)
So be a good patient
Be patient
Stay under my observation
And holler back if you want it...
I know you never had a girl quite like me (uh) me (uh) me (uh) me
I take a hot boy (oy) and give him cold feet (uh) feet (uh) feet

[Hook]
When it comes to love I'm like a surgeon
I'm a true tactician I'm a make your body better when we get in the right position
(I'm like a surgeon)
I'm a make your body jump
Every time my body pumps (uh huh uh huh)
(I'm like a surgeon)
Until your reflexes leave you weak, my love is like anesthesia
I'll rock you fast to sleep
(I'm like a surgeon)
Oh yes, I'm highly qualified
Lay your head back on that pillow and relax your mind

[Bridge 2]
Check (Check) calling patient, patient, patient number one (one)
Make sure that you sign out (out) an when you're done
Make sure you grab a sucker on the way out the door
And make your next appointment an come back and get some more

[Verse 2]
Now that you've learned
You'll be so glad you returned
Open up your mouth, let me check you out
My ears will be your stethoscope
We'll feel your vital signs
And make sure your heart is beating like mine
I appreciate your recovery time
You'll need a physical (one more time) head to feet baby (your just fine)
Your my best patient and you'll never have to wait in line
I know you never had a girl quite like Ci (uh) Ci (uh) me (uh) me
Take a hot boy (oy) and give him cold feet (uh) feet (uh) feet

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]

[Outro]
That's it baby you can count on c give you everything you need
Know that your body got nothing on me
So call me in case of an emergency
