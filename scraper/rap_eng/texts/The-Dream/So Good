[Intro]
Oh
Oh
Whoa
How I'd let him come back (x2)

[Verse 1: Naomi]
She wants ya, I need ya
Please tell me to stay
She says that she loves ya like I love ya
But you know that it ain't the same

We had a fling
This I know
But now we got a thing
She gotta let yo go

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause now I'm actin' crazy
I'm out here callin' you baby
I shouldn't have let you hit that
'cause now I can't forget that
I thought I wouldn't really give a fuck
But now a bitch all in love

[Chorus] (x2)
Don't mean to be a hater
But "Ooh, shit, damn!"
You so good (x6)
So "Ooh, shit, damn!"

[Verse 2: Naomi]
I miss ya, I can taste ya
Please come back to me
Baby lie in my arms
And say you'll never leave

I gotta thing and I know you know
So boy don't play with me, just stay with me
And allow me to give you more

[Pre-Chorus]
My girls all call me crazy
'cause I'm out here callin' you baby
I shouldn't have let you hit that
Cause now I can't forget that
I thought I wouldn't really give a fuck
But now a bitch all in love

[Chorus] (x2)
Don't mean to be a hater
But "Ooh, shit, damn!"
You so good (x6)
So "Ooh, shit, damn!"

[Bridge]
I can't believe you
You put it on a girl like that
I can't believe I
Just got off the phone with you, but I wanna call right back
I can't believe you
Got me in the kitchen cookin' for you like my first name 'Betty'
I can't believe it
But you got that "Ooh ooh ooh ooh"

Yeah, ooh, that feels good right there
Uh-huh, yeah

[Chorus]
But "Ooh, shit, damn!"
You're so good (x6)
So "Ooh, shit, damn!"
