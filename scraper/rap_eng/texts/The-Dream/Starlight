While the starlight's shining down
Girl, make love to me

It's 7:30 on my watch
And I've got your corsage here with me
I run up your stairs into your arms
And you lay a kiss right on my cheek

You wanna take things slow
I respect your wish, so let's go
Before my heart makes a scene
Flea out your door into my car
How can I drive something so beautiful and not speed?

Through the sign that say stop at this line
But I yield for the time being
And tonight's perfect, so say I'm perfect
'Cause I can't get your legs out of my head
Oh, baby, baby

While the starlight's shining down
Girl, make love to me
While the starlight's shining down
Girl, make love to me

To me, to me, to me, to me
Girl, make love to me
To me, to me, to me, to me
Girl, make love to me

Girl, it's 2:30 on the dot
Three hours of daylight left for me
It's either way too hard or you're way too hot
'Cause I gotta end this night with you on me

I hope you entertain me past a kiss
Tonight I just can't have you leave
When you jumped in my car
You jumped in my heart
How can I drive something so beautiful and not speed?

Through the sign that say stop at this line
But I yield for the time being
And tonight's perfect, so say I'm perfect
'Cause I can't get your legs out of my head
Oh baby, baby

While the starlight's shining down
Girl, make love to me
While the starlight's shining down
Girl, make love to me

I can't just take you home
Not after your body has lead me on
I've waited patiently, girl, come on

I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, I need your love
I need your love, baby
Don't you stop, just keep on loving me

While the starlight's shining down
Girl, make love to me
While the starlight's shining down
Girl, make love to me

To me, to me, to me, to me
Girl, make love to me
To me, to me, to me, to me
Girl, make love to me

Let's stop playing games, baby
Let's go
Uh, make love to me
