[Verse 1:]
You're there for me
Through all of my ups and downs
And what I feel
You always seem to know

You find the words
When I need comforting
And dry my eyes
That's why I love you so

[Chorus:]
More than a friend
You're my first love
I can always depend on my first love

[Verse 2:]
I feel like I have known you
All my life
I can't explain how close we are

When something's wrong
You know how to make it right
That's why you stay close to my heart

[Chorus:]
You are more than a friend
You're my first love
I can always depend on my first love

[Hook:]
The first start in my mind
The chill up my spine
The melody in my heart
You are my very first love

You're the sweet lullaby
My first kiss goodnight
You're the beat of my heart
Music, my very first love

[Chorus:]
More than a friend
You're my first love
I can always depend on my first love

[Bridge:]
With you in my life
I'm not lonely at all
And if there were tears
You'd catch them all

Cause you know my pain
And you know my joy
There's no secrets between us
Only pretty piano chords

[Repeat Hook:]

I sing because I'm happy
But music sets me free
You're a sweet lullaby
A first kiss goodnight
The beat of my heart
Music, my very first love

(Oh, Oh, Oh)
