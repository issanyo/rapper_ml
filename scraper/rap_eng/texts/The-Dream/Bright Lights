It's 12 o'clock and we just flew in
The hotel just sent up the Hen
Throw them ones on, and meet me in the lounge
Grab my ice and I'm ready to bounce
Soon as I walked out the door
Oh yeah man there she goes
I saw a fire on the fourteenth floor
Her A... said hey and my D... said oh

She's from the bright lights
I'm from the big city
She's gotta nice ass and got some big oohwees
Oh Lord this girl is so pretty
So let's do it to the congo's
Spend you like a bank roll until you holla let's go

I got downstairs
She just left with her peeps
And I don't want to cause a scene
Ride out 24's in the jeep
CD playa bumpin JZ
Jet ski's big balling in the water
Yet I'm still looking for somebody's daughter
Across the street, on the beach
She came over here just to talk to me
She said

I hope that your feeling me (oh oh)
Cause your eyes is killing me (oh oh)
Boy you looking good(oh oh)
I heard you from the hood (oh oh)
I know you a ways from home (oh oh)
You don't have to be alone(oh oh)
Baby I'll be around (oh oh)
Room 1420 If you down(oh oh)

She's from the bright lights
I'm from the big city
She's gotta nice ass and got some big oohwees
Oh Lord this girl is so pretty
So let's do it to the congo's
Spend you like a bank roll until you holla let's go

You know how we get down, Spend it around here
Down in cancun, Vidal Sasoon
Home girl look like hollywood chick
Pink bandana, her up north gramma
Im the dream girl, break it down
That's it girl, rock and bounce
This is for the girls in the six, all around the world
For a mid west girl, you got a big chest girl uuh!

She's from the bright lights
I'm from the big city
She's gotta nice ass and got some big oohwees
Oh Lord this girl is so pretty
So let's do it to the congo's
Spend you like a bank roll until you holla let's go

She's from the bright lights
I'm from the big city
She's gotta nice ass and got some big oohwees
Oh Lord this girl is so pretty
So let's do it to the congo's
Spend you like a bank roll until you holla let's go

Hey girl, hey girl, you lookin' good
Hey girl, work it just like you should
Hey girl, hey girl your so fine
Don't you want to be by my side

Hey girl, hey girl, you lookin' good
Hey girl, work it just like you should

Don't you want to be by my side
