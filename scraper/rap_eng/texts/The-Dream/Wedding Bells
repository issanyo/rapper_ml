[Intro]
(Just to throw the party)
Divorce rate is at about 60%
(I hear church bells)
There's too many people in your shit!

Mr. Have a Wedding Just to Throw a Party
Nine-layer cake, wash it down with Bacardi
Tux on, grill in, shawty get it started
Bustin' like it's my first time going half on that Molly

I hear wedding bells
(Just to throw a party, nine-layer cake, wash it down with Bacardi)
I hear wedding bells
(Just to throw a party, nine-layer cake, wash it down with Bacardi)

[Verse 1]
She say you've got too much fuckin' baggage
Maybe so, but it's LV all on my baggage
Maybe one day this money could disappear like Magic
Two down and I'm working on this hat trick

[Bridge]
I have her mama like, "Hell nah, he ain't right, ain't ya type"
My sister like, "Hell nah, she ain't right, she ain't ya type"
We ain't right for each other, fuck it, it's nothin'
If I was perfect, I'm sure there'd still be something
I love you babe, but you're killing me
I wanna be the one that gives you everything
They say I'm bad for you, well, shit, you bad for me
Cause I don't give a fuck about nothin' but you
And you give a fuck about everything

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]
I hear wedding bells
I hear wedding bells
I hear wedding bells
I hear wedding bells

[Verse 2]
This psychic told me that I would meet a bad bitch
But she never mentioned that it'd turn out tragic
Wanna save the world, so I'm starting out at Magic
I'm five down and I'm working on my Brad Pitt
