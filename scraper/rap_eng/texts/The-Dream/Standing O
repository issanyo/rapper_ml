[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Oh, oh, oh, ohhh
Here's your standing O

[Verse 1]
Boy, you remind me of a love that seemed so sublime
Your kisses told me, oh, so many lies
Shades on like I am stuntin' through the night
But I'm just hiding puffy eyes
To keep the world from knowing what's inside
I didn't know oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
I was a show oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And your words, they had no meaning
How didn't I foresee this?
Happiness and congrats and all that
I'll pretend I mean it

[Chorus]
So cheers, toast, bravo to you
'Cause you're the man of the hour
I'mma have to send you some flowers, whoa
Cheers, toast, bravo to you
The man of the hour
You played the one that loved you the most
So here's your standing O
Oh, oh, ohhh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhh oh
Boy, so here's your standing O
Oh, oh, ohhh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhh oh
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it
So here's your standing O

[Verse 2]
Here's your standing ovation
Doctor, I was too patient
Even when you wasn't enough
I'm the one that taught you how to love
And boy, I gave you all of me
The parts of affection you couldn't see
As you embrace her in your arms give her "my all"
Give her more than you gave to me

[Pre-Chorus]
When you had nothing, I gave
When you were weak, I made you brave
You wanna leave me with the scars on my heart
It's funny how y'all forget it all

[Chorus]
So cheers, toast, bravo to you
'Cause you're the man of the hour
I'mma have to send you some flowers, ooh
Oh, cheers, toast, bravo to you
The man of the hour
You played the one that loved you the most
So here's your standing O
Oh, oh, ohhh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhh oh
Boy, so here's your standing O
Oh, oh, ohhh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhh oh
Oh, oh, oh ohhh oh
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it
So here's your standing O

[Bridge]
Round of applause to the, biggest fool in the world
Give them all that you got
And they still ride out into the sunset with the next girl
Round of applause to the, biggest fool in the world
Give them all that you got
And they still ride out into the sunset with the next girl

[Chorus]
Standing ovation, congratulations
Damn, I was down for it
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it
Boy, here's your standing O
Standing ovation, congratulations
Damn, I was down for it
Gave you my heart and all you did was pound on it
All you did was pound on it
Gave you my heart
And all you did was pound on it
All you did was pound on it
