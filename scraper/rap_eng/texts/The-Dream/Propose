Thinking the ways to say I love you
Thinking the ways to say I love you
No better way to say I'm love you
Thinking the ways to say I love you
There's no better way to say I love you
There's no better way to say I love you

Baby I propose you
If you needed me to
'Cause your wrong rings bound to serve For me
And no ring compares to you
Boy you're my wings
And you're my sky
And without you baby I just can't fly

It seems like it was just yesterday
Waking up to your face
I knew right then, and there baby
Everything would be okay
You looked into my eyes
And all that I could see was me
And everything that is is everything you said it would be
And things go up, and things fall down
I think they call that love
And all the imperfections in this world Created a perfect us
If you want I'll take a bending knew
And look right in your eyes
Just so you know where I stand
You're always in my mind

Baby I propose you
If you needed me to
'Cause your wrong rings bound to serve For me
And no ring compares to you
Boy you're my wings
And you're my sky
And without you baby I just can't fly

I bought right dear, eagerless
Soaken in these memories of us
Full of heights, we're standing low
I wanna see this through til the end
Until my eyes close
And things go up, and things fall down
I think they call that love
And all the imperfections in this world Created a perfect us
If you want I'll take a bending knew
And look right in your eyes
Just so you know where I stand
You're always in my mind
Baby I propose you
If you needed me to
'Cause your wrong rings bound to serve For me
And no ring compares to you
Boy you're my wings
And you're my sky
And without you baby I just can't fly

I propose to you
If you needed me to
'Cause your wrong rings bound to serve For me
And no ring compares to you
Boy you're my wings
And you're my sky
And without you baby I just can't fly

I can't fight without you baby
To get down on my bended knee
But I love you, I do so much
And I love you, I love you

I can't do with you
I just can't fly
