[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
My momma told me that this could happen to me
That he would grow up and be the sexy man
But, oh, I just couldn't see
'Cause I didn't plan this alone, I was in my zone
And had the thought of us in my head
Somehow I turned this all off
And then I met him and he wasn't you
And then I dropped my head, thinking, what should I do?

[Chorus]
Oh I, I loved you, and you loved me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I, cared for you, and I didn't see this through
Now I know in my heart you will always be the greatest ex ever

[Verse 2]
Now when you do a simple thing like fall asleep
Oh, 'cause I can't close my eyes
Without a day with you in my dreams
Sometimes I call your phone just to hear your tone
And I never say nothing, wait just like a couple of seconds
To hear you breathe and then I'm gone
But he's not like you
Can't help but to hold my head again, what did I do?

[Chorus]
Oh, I, I, loved you, and you loved me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I, cared for you and I didn't see this through
Now I know in my heart you will always be the greatest ex ever

[Bridge]
And I know that it's all my fault (all my fault)
And it would be a lie if I said you didn't cross my mind at all
How do I erase my days, they're shaded in blue
All of my love's for you

[Chorus]
Oh, I, I loved you, and you loved me
And I just couldn't see tomorrow, baby
And I, cared for you, and I didn't see this through
Now I know in my heart you will always be the greatest ex ever
And ever, and ever...

The greatest ex ever, and ever, and ever (Repeat until end)
