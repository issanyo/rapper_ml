[Intro]
Now lay, now lay, lay, lay
Now lay, (oh oh oh)
Now lay, lay, lay, lay

[Verse 1]
I got a shoulder built for you
Just in case you need it to lean on
These hands I have are for you
Just in case you need help to hold on

[Pre-Chorus]
The world is just a supersized merry-go-round
Sometimes your finger lose their grip, we all fall down
Don't sit there in the dark, don't worry your heart
Everything will be fine if trees fall on your power line

[Chorus]
If the winds turn strong
You will always have a home
If your power's out
If the light turns dark
You can stay here in my heart
If your power's out

[Post Chorus]
My food is yours
Take all you want
My bed is yours
Sleep all you want, yeah
