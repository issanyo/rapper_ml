[Intro]
We are gathered here today
To witness the wild become the ways of the man
To share in the destruction
And introduction into the future
All past will be forgotten
All sins will be forgiven
Follow me
Follow me into the spectre

I've become my worst enemy
Roll it up girl, roll it up girl
Roll it up girl and let it breathe
Roll up, show up, throw it up
You know that's society
Fat lords, demigods
Spectre, spectre
When the life ain't took it all
Spectre, spectre
No light for the lone stars
Spectre, spectre
On deck with the robots
Spectre, spectre
Next life we'll be gods
Next life we'll be gods
Next life we'll be--

[White noise]
