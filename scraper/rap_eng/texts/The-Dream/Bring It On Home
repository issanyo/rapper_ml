[Verse 1]
If you ever change your mind
About leaving, leaving me behind

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

[Verse 2]
I know I laughed when you left
But now I know I only hurt myself

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

[Verse 3]
I will give you jewelry and money, too
That ain't all, that ain't all I will do for you

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

[Verse 4]
You know I will always be your slave
Until I'm buried, buried in my grave

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me

[Verse 5]
One more thing
I tried to treat you right
But you stayed out, stayed out at night

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, bring it to me
Bring your sweet loving
Bring it on home to me
