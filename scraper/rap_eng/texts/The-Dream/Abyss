[Intro]
The cause of you, because of you
Even though I've said we're through
It's all because of you, Nikki

[Verse 1]
She told me she would always be there
And I believed her, believed her
This girl was no good for me
She had so many secrets, secrets...yeah
Even though she wasn't my main girl
I was still committed
It was me and you
You said you wouldn't tell
But you saved my voicemails
But I always knew

[Pre-Chorus]
So now cry 'till you drown your face
And bitch I give a damn how harsh this may seem
I'm here to put your heart in its place
Chained up in the bottom of the lake

[Chorus]
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)

[Verse 2]
I was the innocent bystander
She had etiquette, she had good manners
Pretty little thing, great little body
Never in magazines, never at after parties
And I could sense it then, but it didn't matter
As long as me and you were together
Thought it was better than that
I'll never let you back to me
Tell your boy at US Weekly
I sent your photos to TMZ
[Pre-Chorus]
So now cry 'till you drown your face
And bitch I give a damn how harsh this may seem
I'm here to put your heart in it's place
Chained up at the bottom of the lake

[Chorus]
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)

[Bridge]
The sun will come and help dry the water away
But you're in the abyss, my lady, and you won't see another day

[Pre-Chorus]
So now cry 'till you drown your face
And bitch I give a damn how harsh this may seem
I'm here to put your heart in it's place
Chained up at the bottom of the lake

[Chorus]
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)
Now let the water fall (abyss)

[Outro]
Oh yeah, baby
Oh yeah, baby
Oh yeah, baby
You won't see me
Oh yeah, no no, no no, no no
The sun will come and help dry the water away
But you're in the abyss, my lady, and you won't see another day
The sun will come and help dry the water away
But you're in the abyss, my lady, and you won't see another day
