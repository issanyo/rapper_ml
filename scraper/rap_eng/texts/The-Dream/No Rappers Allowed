[Pre-Chorus]
Monday, I'm gon’ kiss it
Tuesday, I'm gon' kill it
Wednesday, you gon’ miss that
Thursday, I'm gon' fix that
Friday, we gon' sit back
And you might need the weekend off
Nothing better than you laying next to me
Girl, I'm 'bout that action
That, I can guarantee

[Chorus]
I ain't no rapper, I'm by myself
Girl, what I’m on, need no one else
Don’t got no crew, I just need you
I'm puttin’ it out there, you're free to choose
I ain't no rapper, I just fuck a lot
I roll up a lot and go up a lot
You just need love, that's nothin’ new
I'm puttin' it out there, you're free to choose

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, baby, ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, yeah (I just fuck a lot)

[Verse]
When we together, we super lit
I know you know when I hit you up, I need a fix
Let me dip these diamonds in that rose gold, you legit
Even though I love to see you go, we're not finished it
Wanna fuck you all the time
It's always on our minds, but we don't mind
Look at how you walk, look at how you talk
Girl, I can't wait to murder that, somebody get the chalk, mmhmm

[Pre-Chorus]
Monday, I'm gon' kiss it
Tuesday, I'm gon' kill it
Wednesday, you gon' miss that
Thursday, I'm gon' fix that
Friday, we gon' sit back
And you might need the weekend off
Nothing better than you laying next to me
Girl, I'm 'bout that action
That, I can guarantee

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I ain't no rapper, I'm by myself
