[Chorus 1]
Let's make this the day
That we'll remember
Let's make what what we have
Forever go on
Take my hand as your gift
And fall for me
You take my heart and we'll forever live on

[Chorus 2]
Pass me your love and I'll pass you mine
Unwrap me now and I hope before the end of the night you'll

[Chorus 3]
Kiss me for Christmas
Kiss me for Christmas
All I want is you
All you need is me
Kiss me for Christmas
Kiss me for Christmas
All I want is you
All you need is me
Can you believe?
Do you believe?

[Verse]
As I lay next to you
In front of the fire
And a gift of a lifetime is here in our arms
I look to you boy
Always look to me baby
And this feeling we have today will last forever
It will never be gone

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 1]
Lets make this the day
That we'll remember
Let's make what we have forever go on

[Chorus 3]
