[Verse 1]
Know I'm missin' that kissin' in the rover
Boy, what I'm feelin', never feel it about another
I need you, why can't you come over?
Ain't you my lover, but I love you like a brother
Babe, you the one at the end of the day
You are who you are and I love you that way
Lust ain't love, if you know the difference
You ran a little game on ya, caught up in your feelings
We together like..
Ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I'mma do whatever, I'm not gon' leave (oh, yeah, yeah)
This kind of love don't come easy (ah, yeah, yeah)
We don't care what they think, babe
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you'll stay right here for me

[Chorus]
See, I know you like being 'round chicks
And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
What can I say? (what can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe (that's what I love about you, babe)
Yeah, I don't ask, 'cause I know you gon' lie
You're way too sexy, to ever be shy
What can I say? (what can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe (that's what I love about you, babe)

[Post-Chorus]
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya, do ya, do ya thang
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Go ahead

[Verse 2]
You the shit
Yeah, baby, you the bomb
Middle of the day, give me what I want
It feels so special, it feels so good
And he ain’t goin' no where even if he could
I got that ow, ow
You know what I’m talkin' about, 'bout
Make a nigga scream and shout, shout
Everytime the lights go out, out
We out, out

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that I'mma do whatever, I'm not gon' leave (oh, yeah, yeah)
This kind of love don't come easy (ah, yeah, yeah)
Fuck what you think, babe
Promise we'll stay the same
Say that you'll stay right here for me

[Chorus]
See, I know you like being 'round chicks
And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
What can I say? (what can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe (that's what I love about you, babe)
Yeah, I don't ask, 'cause I know you gon' lie
You're way too sexy, to ever be shy
What can I say? (what can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe (that's what I love about you, babe)

[Post-Chorus]
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang

[Bridge]
Ah, and I know what you thinking of
That I don't know a thing about love
But what I know is I'm his girl
And he's the one for me
See, this shit ain't worth tripping over
Do your thing, it doesn't matter
As long as we gon' rock forever
Love is all we need

[Post-Bridge]
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya thang, do ya, do ya, do ya thang
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
(Go ahead)
Do ya thang, do ya thang
Do ya, do ya, do ya thang
(Go ahead)

[Hook]
See, I know you like being 'round chicks
And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
Hey, what can I say? (what can I say?)
That's what I love about you, babe (that's what I love about you, babe)
