[Intro: The-Dream]
I pray about you
Can't live without you
I pray about you
Can't live without you
I pray about you
Can't live without you
I pray about you
And I lie 'cause I need you
I pray about you
Can't live without you
I pray about you
And I lie 'cause I need you

[Verse 1: Kacy Hill]
This mind just keeps me alive
It pulls me deeper in life
It can't seem to miss you
Can't wish to be with you tonight

[Pre-Chorus: The-Dream]
I pray about you (about you)
Can't live without you
I pray about you (about you)

[Chorus: The-Dream]
And still I wait up, I stay up, I wake up
I pray about you
I know I fucked up don't know face in this cup
Can't live without you
But he lies like I lied but my lies were sweeter
He lies 'cause he want you
And I lie 'cause I need you

[Break: Kacy Hill & The-Dream]
Can't wish to be with you tonight
Can't wish to be with you tonight
About you
I pray about you
Can't wish to be with you tonight
Can't wish to be with you tonight
Can't wish to be with you tonight

[Chorus: The-Dream]
And still I wait up, I stay up, I wake up
I pray about you
I know I fucked up don't know face in this cup
Can't live without you
But he lies like I lied but my lies were sweeter
He lies 'cause he want you
And I lie 'cause I need you

[Break: Kacy Hill & The-Dream]
Can't wish to be with you tonight
Can't wish to be with you tonight
He lies 'cause he want you
And I lie 'cause I need you
Can't wish to be with you tonight
Can't wish to be with you tonight
Can't wish to be with you tonight
Can't wish to be with you tonight
Can't wish to be with you tonight

[Outro: The-Dream]
I pray about you
Can't live without you
I pray about you
Can't live without you
