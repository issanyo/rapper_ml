[Verse 1]
First I hit my clique
Baby, where you at
Stay right where you at
I'll be right there
Love, love is in the air
High on life, I know you see my flair
Babe, I'm trying to get waste, shitfaced
Let him stay here
Where we going, just let me know it
Hands in the air like I don't care

[Pre-Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
So I'm glad the night is young
May this moment be embedded
Run, running 'til the dawn
And if nothing comes of tomorrow
We've left nothing to be done
They say nothing lasts forever
So let's sing it in unison

[Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Sing it in unison
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Sing it in unison

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm laying on your shoulder
Hold me like you know me
And don't be scared
In the moment, seize it when you got it
Like you can't live without it
'cause life ain't fair
In my vibe, I'm in my zone
Wanna rock wit' you, let me share
On my Michael, on my Diana
I'm looking crazy, I don't care

[Pre-Chorus]
They say nothing lasts forever
So I'm glad the night is young
May this moment be embedded
Run, running 'til the dawn
And if nothing comes of tomorrow
We've left nothing to be done
They say nothing lasts forever
So let's sing it in unison

(chorus )

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Sing it in unison
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Sing it in unison


[Outro]
Take me away tonight
Rock me all night
Sing me a sweet lullaby
Live the moment like is the last
Take me away tonight
Rock me all night (singing in unison)
Sing me a sweet lullaby
Live the moment like is the last
(let's sing it in unison)
