You told me
That you?d always be my love
You showed me
My love just wasn?t enough
Now I?m on this train
The tracks falling off of my brain
It won?t be long
Say that you love me again
You know I?m always your friend
So what you want babe
I promise I?ll change
I promise I?ll change
Girl I promise I?ll change
You said
You would always be in my arms
Girl that?s what you said
You said that you would always be mine
Now I?m on this train
That?s falling off the edge
And I?m afraid
A toll is at the end
And I promise I?ll change
Said that I?ll change
I know I told that I, I?ll change
That fact that you don?t love me, love me
Because I?m still the same
The same
The same
The same
I?m still the same
The same
When you left me on that train
The fact is girl
I was way over my head
You gave me so much more
I gave you so much less

Now I?m wishing you the best
Cause I swore I would change, change
I swore that I would change
When you left me on that train
You told me
That you would always be my love
You showed me
My love just wasn?t enough
Say that you love me again
You know I?m always your friend
So what you want babe
I promise I?ll change
I promise I?ll change
Even though I promised you everything
I am changed
You would always be in my arms
I promised you the same
That you?ll always be mine
But now I?m on that train
That?s falling off the edge
And I?m afraid
But this time is still the end
And I promised I?ll change
I swear that I will change
I promise I?ll change
The fact is that you don?t love me, love me
Because I?m still the same
The same
The same
The same
I?m still the same
The same
When you left me on that train
