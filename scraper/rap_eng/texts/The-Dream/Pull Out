[Intro]
See, I just wanna love ya
Until you go soft
Until we get lost, tell them niggas get lost
Tell them other niggas get lost
See, I just wanna love ya
Until you go soft
Until we get lost, tell them niggas get lost
Tell them other niggas get lost

[Verse 1]
I'm so serious, delirious
I get furious
Curiously
Tell me where you come from
Tell me where you come from
I can't wait to go down
Tell me where your man at
Tell me where your man at
'Cause I know you ain't here alone
You by yourself I see
Well, I major in anatomy, mmm
I need a chef ass bitch with that recipe
To come and whip something up for me

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna pull out
I don't wanna pull out, no, not now
Oh, girl you got that good, good, good, good, good, good, good
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Wanna pull out
I don't wanna pull out, no, not now
Oh, girl you got that good, good, good, good, good, good, good
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it

[Verse 2]
Girl, you so nasty
When you're walking past me, all I see is asscheeks
I just want a backseat
Always lookin' flashy
Turn around and flash me
I just want a sneak peek, I just wanna be me
I know what you're known for
I know what you came for
Dolled and you done came up
You'll get what you aim for
Used to drive a Focus
Now you in a Lexus
Presidential Rolexes
Lessons

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't wanna pull out
I don't wanna pull out, no, not now
Oh, girl you got that good, good, good, good, good, good, good
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
Wanna pull out
I don't wanna pull out, no, not now
Oh, girl you got that good, good, good, good, good, good, good
Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it, do it
