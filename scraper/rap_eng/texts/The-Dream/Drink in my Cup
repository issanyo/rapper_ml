[Bridge: Binkie]
Cup sip yep yurp
Two step stop yurp
You know what it is
When I'm on the floor
I drop that, I pop that
I dip it low
I ride that like some hundred spokes
I glide that like a motor boat
I park that like turn
Get up off that
Look back

[Chorus:]
All my girls
Got that drink in my cup [x4]
I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly in high
I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly in by
Got that drink in my cup [x4]
I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly in high
I'm fly I'm fly I'm fly in by

Cup sip yep yurrrrr
Two step stop yurrrr
