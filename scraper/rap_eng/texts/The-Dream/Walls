[Verse 1]
Just tear down the walls
Fall, fall
Blood seeps through the floor
We both fall, fall

[Bridge]
Those rainbow colors we seen on yesterday
Suddenly rip and fade into pastel grey
I don't know what else to convey
Except I'm gone without you
Gone

[Hook]
Wish I could fly away
Back to the place where we used to lay
I wish I could fly away
Back to that place where we found love, where we
Gone
Where have we gone?
Where have we gone

[Verse 2]
Now that we've lived through the horrors
Playing to fire is a deadly disease
Will this ice stop me?
Freeze

[Bridge]
Those rainbow colors we seen on yesterday
Suddenly rip and fade into pastel grey
I don't know what else to convey
Except I'm gone

[Hook]
Wish I could fly away
Back to that place
I wish I could fly away
Back to that place where I used to know love
But it's gone
But it's gone

[Outro]
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
I wish I could die away
Cause there's no place for loving and I
I may as well die away
Let me die away
Let me die away
Let me die away
Let me die away
Cause there's no way to fly to after this place
I may as well die...
