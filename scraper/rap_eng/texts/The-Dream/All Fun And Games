One of us gotta be serious, serious
One of us needs to be serious, serious
One of us gotta be serious, serious
I need no time to think about this
I've had this done before
You give your all to everything you can
My navigation must be off

You told me that you've changed
You still show up the same
Boy, you tell me that you'll neva do that thing again
Turn for the worst dead end

It's all fun and games till somebody gets hurt
Till somebody show up lookin' for they love
It's all fun and games till it all goes bad
Now you leaning on the door cause you can't take no more
It's all fun and games till somebody gets hurt
You'll be crossed at everything
Now nothing works
It's all fun and games till somebody gets close
And the one you lost, you love the most

What do you want me to tell you?
What do you want me to say?
Baby, what else can I show you?
I've shown you in every way
Have you lost your mind? Lost yo mind? Huh?
Who you think I am, think I am?
You ain't gonna be wastin' my time, wastin' my time
When we both know you'd never last long

You told me that you've changed
You still show up the same
Boy, you tell me that you'll neva do that thing again
Turn for the worst dead end

It's all fun and games till somebody gets hurt
Till somebody turns up lookin' for they love
It's all fun and games till it all goes bad
Now you need it on that john cause you can't take no more
It's all fun and games till somebody gets hurt
You'll be crossed at everything
I know how that works
It's all fun and games till somebody gets close
And the one with the loss, you are the most
