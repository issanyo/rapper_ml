404 612, hand me the phone, I’ll put it in for you
By myself slow dancing to this song (to this song)
See you watching baby, I'ma put you on (put you on)
Get up on me and I might just try you on (try you on)
Tonight, you might just get this phone number

404 612, hand me the phone, I’ll put it in for you
Running into you ain’t no coincidence
I’ve been watching you forever since, and

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
Not him, not him, not him

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
Not him, not him, not him, boy

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
He can try, He can try but

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
So long I’ve been in love with you

So long, long, long, long, long, long
For so long, long, long, long, long, long

Tryna keep it 100 because I'm not with the games, yo
And I don't run around giving out info
Not tryna be funny, it's just a side note
Otherwise I’m just falling for you
310 412, you got me selling out
Here’s the Cali number too
Running into you ain't no coincidence
I sung this part already
But I’ll sing it again (for you)

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
Not him, not him, not him

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
Not him, not him, not him, boy

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
He can try, he can try but

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
So long I’ve been in love with you

Oh if you’re ready to go
We can kick this thing off like first quarter
Baby just let me know
We can slide up outta here, ride up outta here
No pressure, no pressure
Baby just let me show you my affection

And you can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it, but
Once you've get it, what you gon do then?

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
Not him, not him, not him

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
Baby you can get it

You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
You can get it, you can get it
So long I’ve been waiting for you

For so long, long, long, long, long
For so long, long, long, long, long, long
