Here I am, masterplan, gotta find someone to get on
Play the game, stake my claim, unashamed I'll burn it up
Come to me, dance with me, befriend me, do to me, anything that you want
Worship me, adore me, ah you're so good for me - you're my faith I believe
Unforgiven, for what we've done
Unforgiven for what we have have not done
Then again, be my friend, is this how all love begins?
Face to face in this place, in the landscape of your skin
Come to me, dance with me, befriend me, do to me, anything that you want
Worship me, adore me, ah you're so good for me - you're my faith I believe
Unforgiven, for what we've done
Unforgiven for what we have have not done
Committed a crime, unforgiven
I'm guilty of lying, unforgiven
I cheat on the deal, unforgiven
And given away all hope of love and life for free
God help me, God help we
Unforgiven, for what we've done
Unforgiven for what we have have not done
Committed a crime, unforgiven
I'm guilty of lying, unforgiven
I cheat on the deal, unforgiven
And given away all hope of love and life for free
The lies that we've told, unforgiven
We reap what we've sown, unforgiven
We cheat on the deal, unforgiven
We've given away all hope of love, the things that we've done
We've given away all hope of love and life for free
God help me, God help we....
