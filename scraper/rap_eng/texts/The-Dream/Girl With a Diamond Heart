[Intro]
Anything

[Verse 1]
What happened to them, we could've did
We could've been anything
I didn't care, I needed your love
I would've been, I would've did
I would've shared everything
No motive, just because

[Chorus]
You couldn't handle my love
And let me walk right out the door
The girl with the diamond heart
No, I'm not charmless anymore
We were nothing but a dream
Now you're left there imagining
In a room full of dyin' hearts
Let it bleed, let it breathe, singing

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
La la la la la la la la la la, anything

[Verse 2]
You had my ears, you had my eyes
I couldn't see anything
Nothing baby, but you, you
And you had my mind, you had my heart
You had my soul, everything
You had me diamond blood, you, you

[Chorus]
You couldn't handle my love
And let me walk right out the door
The girl with the diamond heart
No, I'm not charmless anymore
We were nothing but a dream
Now you're left there imagining
In a room full of dyin' hearts
Let it bleed, let it breathe, singing

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
La la la la la la la la la la, anything

[Bridge]
The feeling that I feel inside
Used to make me feel so damn high
It's hidden now, you can't rewind
No coal left in that diamond mine
Best love is the love that's lost
Reminding you you're all alone
All those fights I can recall
Now someone else sits on your throne

[Chorus]
You couldn't handle my love
And let me walk right out the door
The girl with the diamond heart
No, I'm not charmless anymore
We were nothing but a dream
Now you're left there imagining
In a room full of dyin' hearts
Let it bleed, let it breathe, singing

[Post-Chorus]
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
La la la la la la la la la la, anything
