[Produced by The-Dream]

I just want to roll with you
There's nothin else that I would rather do
I'm shootin for the stars, maybe we can land on the moon
Baby I'd be your fool, you're so dope and cool
But you're with this other guy - maybe some other time
But damn, I wish you were mine

I just want to lay with you - can I spend all day with you?
Usually I'm not that guy, but there's something bout you I like
I want to be the one, when it's all said and done
But I may never get that chance cause you got a man
But damn, I wish you were mine
I'm on my "I luv your girl" shit
And really I'm sorry, but I'm not really sorry, at all
And I don't want to start shit, and I know that I'm starting shit
Get rid of that starter kit and come on

Girl I wish you were mine
Girl I wish you were mine
I wish you were mine

Why we always on something that somebody else got?
But this ain't like none of them times, I really adore you a lot
Trying to make you my girl even though you got a man
This ain't no one night stand, shit
Stalking you like a fan, shit
I'm just playing, shit you know your body's the bomb
So you'll do whatever you want, you got me in my falsetto
Singing all this sweet shit all up in your flower bomb
I'm ready to make every time feel like your first time
I know he's waiting at home
But thinking bout it ain't a crime..
I wish you were mine
