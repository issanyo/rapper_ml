[Intro]
Radio Killer Records on your ass since the 2000's, nigga

[Verse 1]
Just stay a while with me
Let me lay here in your hair
The night is young, baby
Don't bite my tongue, no I
Bring that ass over
And put that ass on my, body
I'm so glad that you came over, I can use a little company, baby
Just love to lay here in your hair
Will you let me lay here in your hair?

[Chorus]
She like, "Boy, give me that" (Oh, oh, oh)
"Give me that" (Oh, oh, oh)
"Give me that" (Oh-oh-oh)
"Give me that" (Oh-oh-oh)
"Give me that" (Oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
It's too dark for silhouettes up in here
You're too confident for regrets up in here
You talk that shit like you mean it
She say I talk that shit like I mean it, mmh
I've never been a poster boy
But I always came through like the mailman
I will never try to out-pretty you, uh
But I'd rather tear that back out instead

[Chorus]
She like, "Boy, give me that" (Oh, oh, oh)
"C'mon on now, give me that" (Oh, oh, oh)
"Oh, give me that" (Oh-oh-oh)
She like, "Boy, give me that" (Oh-oh-oh)
"Baby, give me that" (Oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Let me love you right, mmh-hm
Show me, I'll do you right, mmh-hm, mmh

[Outro]
She like, "Boy, give me that" (Steady, steady)
She like, "Boy, give me that" (Steady, steady)
She like, "Boy, give me that" (Steady, steady)
She like, "Boy, give me that" (Steady, steady)
She like, "Boy, give me that" (Steady, steady)
"C'mon now, give me that" (Steady, steady)
"Oh, give me that" (Steady)
She like, "Boy, give me that" (Steady)
"Baby, give me that"
