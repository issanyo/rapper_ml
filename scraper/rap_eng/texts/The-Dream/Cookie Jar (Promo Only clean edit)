Radio killa, killa

(Gym Class Heroes:)
You know what it is
Gym Class Heroes, The Dream
It's hard to look innocent when I got cookie crumbs all over my face
Hehe yeah

(The-Dream:)
I like girls, they like me
They look so good in their Seven jeans
Want you to be the one and my only
I wanna be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

(Gym Class Heroes:)
My hands, my hands, my ha-, uh, my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

(Gym Class Heroes:)
You see I got this problem, I need help tryin' to solve it
'cause meeting after meeting and I'm still a cookie-holic
You can hide em, I'm-a find them, on the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it with my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps to catch me eating Scoobie snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once but I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me and I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth that'll never come loose
And the truth of the matter is

(The-Dream:)
I like girls, they like me
They look so good in their Seven jeans
Want you to be the one and my only
I wanna be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

(Gym Class Heroes:)
My hands, my hands, my ha-, uh, my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

(Gym Class Heroes:)
I got a thing for Milano, Biscotti, Italianos
And I never turn down some Oreos if you got those
Butter Pecan, Puerto Rican, or them Oatmeal Raisin Asians
Hazelnut Brazilians, Macadamia Caucasians
Double stuffed or thin mint, it don't matter you getting it
Cause I got a sweet tooth that'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is

(The-Dream:)
I like girls, they like me
They look so good in their Seven jeans
Want you to be the one and my only
I wanna be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

(Gym Class Heroes:)
My hands, my hands, my ha-, uh, my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my, uh, my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

(Gym Class Heroes:)
I'm a monster for these cookies, I'm a beast for the treats
An animal for the crackers, head to feet they so damn sweet
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha- uh my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

(Gym Class Heroes:)
And there you have it, I tried my best
I went to Cookie Anonymous... I guess I'm a failure
I can't seem to keep my damn hands out the cookie jar but it is what it is
