[Intro]

I know, I know its too late for sorrys
I know, I know its too late for sorrys
I know, I know its too late for sorrys
Girl I know I know its too late for sorry

[Verse 1]
I know, that you will never ever forgive me (hmmm, hmmm)
And I know, I will never find no one more special than (hmmmmm, hmmm)
Stupid, so stupid
What was I doing? (hmmm, hmmm)
And if I was you, I would have left my ass too. (hummm, humm)

[Hook]
I lost my girl and no ones standing next to me
I need the love with you is where I'd rather be
I ain't worth nothing, just toss me out into the sea
If you're in love, don't you dare sing along with me

Woooooooaaaaah
Wooooooooaaaah

(Come back, come back, right now, right now)

[Verse 2]
Now, I want to press rewind and fall in love again
With, you.(hummmm, hummm)
I wish I'd never lied
Should have been true. (oh yes sir)

[Hook]
I lost my girl and no ones standing next to me
I need the love with you is where id rather be
I ain't worth nothing just toss me out into the sea
If youre in love, dont you dare sing along with me

Woah x2

[Verse 3]
I know, I know its too late for sorrys
I know, I know its too late for sorrys
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know its too late for sorrys
I know, I know its too late for sorrys
I know, I know, its too late for sorrys
