Me and you used to be close
You used hang out round my way
And now a nigga feel like shit
Every time the DJ start doing his thing

His thing thing thing
His thing
Doing his thing
DJ…


Does anybody love anymore?
The sad lyrics are driving me crazy
I’m sittin up in here all alone
You see, yesterday I lost my baby
Top phones on my radio
This record seems to be their favorite
Top painted 80’s on
Another fuckin break up song


I’ll be sippin on this deuce til the break of dawn
Screamin DJ, don’t you play that song
I know you just tryna get yo playlist on
And have me rollin in my tears til the break of dawn
I be sippin on this bottle baby all night long
Dreamin DJ, don’t you play that song
I know you just tryna get yo playlist on
Deuce got me rollin in my tears all night long


Com’on, Com’on, Com’on, Com’on
Com’on, Com’on, Com’on
Com’on, Com’on, Com’on, Com’on
I know it’s comin


Oh, I can fill these empty bottles with my tears
Lookin in this mirror with a broken heart
That’s bad luck for 7 years
And after begging for your love
You rip right through my heart, through my heart
After begging for your love
Baby, don’t know who you are
Yea yea


I’ll be sippin on this deuce til the break of dawn
Screamin DJ, don’t you play that song
I know you just tryna get yo playlist on
And have me rollin in my tears til the break of dawn
I be sippin on this bottle baby all night long
Dreamin DJ, don’t you play that song
I know you just tryna get yo playlist on
Deuce got me rollin in my tears all night long


Com’on, Com’on, Com’on, Com’on
Com’on, Com’on, Com’on
Com’on, Com’on, Com’on, Com’on
I know it’s comin


Me and you used to be close
You used hang out round my way
And now a nigga feel like shit
Every time the DJ start doing his thing
And I’m sick on my stomach
Cause I know it’s comin
Killin me softly with that song song song
Go on and get it over, so I can get over it
Finally think you’re over it but then here it goes again


I’ll be sippin on this deuce til the break of dawn (all night long)
Screamin DJ, don’t you play that song (don’t you play that song)
I know you just tryna get yo playlist on
And have me rollin in my tears til the break of dawn
I be sippin on this bottle baby all night long (sippin on this bottle)
Dreamin DJ, don’t you play that song
I know you just tryna get yo playlist on
Deuce got me rollin in my tears all night long


Com’on, Com’on, Com’on, Com’on
Com’on, Com’on, Com’on
Com’on, Com’on, Com’on, Com’on
I know it’s comin


DJ start callin out the countdown
Number 8, take it easy on my heart now
You know number 7 ain’t number 6
Come on partner get it over with
It ain’t number 5, it ain’t number 4
Got my heart out here in the cold
If it ain’t number 3 must be number 2
‘Cause if it’s number 1, I’m done
