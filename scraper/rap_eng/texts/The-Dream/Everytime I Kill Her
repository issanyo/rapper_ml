[Verse 1]
Girl I see you, girl I see you, I'm your stan
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Wakin' up to you patrollin', that should be a sin (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Every time I'm near her
Every time I feel her
Always have to clean up
Every time I kill her
Ooh
Every time I kill her
Ooh
Every time I kill her
Every time I kill her
Every time I kill her

[Chorus]
Every time I kill her
Every time I kill her
Every time I kill her
Every time I kill her

[Verse 2]
Pipe down
Come here right now
Now hum
Like you know
And like you need it
Take me, but don't hate me
Baby spend it, but don't break me
Come on love me, don't foresake me
Respect me, don't debate me
Every time I kill her
Every time I kill her

[Chorus]
Every time I kill her
Every time I kill her
Every time I kill her
Every time I kill her
