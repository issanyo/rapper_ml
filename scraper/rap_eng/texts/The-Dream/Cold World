[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh
Babe, babe
Uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Oh baby, have you ever wonder why
Or even questioned why I was leaving
And why I was cheating, and why I lied
Oh baby, I know you have to think this for yourself
See I'm never around, I'm always out of town
Loving someone else

[Pre-Chorus]
But you think you're cool
But let the cool tell me why am I leaving
You think your love's so smooth
Oh, won't you tell me why I'm deceiving you
If your heart was so warm, tell me why I don't need you
Because when you told me that you loved me
I never believed you

[Chorus]
I guess it's a cold, cold, cold, cold world
Baby, that we're living in
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na
Cold, cold, cold, cold world
Baby, that we're living in
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, tell me all, you're out your mind
If love was a job, anybody could get it
If all you gotta be, it's fine
Oh baby, you better be careful what you say
Cause all just gets older, world can take colder
Nobody will look your way

[Pre-Chorus]
But you think you're so cool
So cool, then why am I leaving
You think you're so smooth
Tell me why am I deceiving
And if your kisses was so sweet, tell me why I don't need you
Because when you told me that you loved me
I never believed you

[Chorus]
I guess it's a cold, cold, cold, cold world
Baby, that we're living in
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na
Cold, cold, cold world
Baby, that we're living in
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na
All about, all about this ship is leaving
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na
No war, no war, these soldiers, I'm a dreamer
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na

[Chorus]
I guess it's a cold, cold world
Baby, that we're living in
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na
Cold, cold world
Baby, that we're living in
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na
I guess it's a cold, cold world
Baby, that we're living in
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na
I guess it's a cold, cold world
Baby, that we're living in
La la la la na na na na na
La la la la na na na na na
