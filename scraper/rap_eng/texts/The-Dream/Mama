This is an interpretation of what a mother tells her son
Her only one
Sometimes, this road will bear no signs of direction, direction
So rely on your heart to lead the way, lead the way, lead
And sometimes you will need to take correction, correction
Don't you dare let your humble mind sway proceed
See, some days will be brighter than a baby's name
And others will be grayer than the hairs on your daddy's face
And when those gray days start to come
Just take it in and just say

Oooo oo oooo, and know that the sun's coming tomorrow, oh yeah, I promise
Oooo oo oooo, you know that it will be okay, yeah
Oooo oo oooo, and know that the sun's coming tomorrow, oh yeah, I promise
Oooo oo oooo, you know that it will be okay, yeah

Off Don't wonder, off, don't wonder, off
Don't wonder, off, don't wonder, off

I'll let you know, I wanna let you know, mother, oh
I wanna let you know how I've been thinkin' 'bout you
How I've been thinkin' of you
Always thinkin' of you
I wanna let you know I've been thinkin' of you
Always thinkin' of you
I'm always thinkin' of you

It was you that brought me through
You were everything I ever knew
If I could bring you back
I'd do it in a split second, no if, ands or buts at all

How I've been thinkin' 'bout you
How I've been thinkin' of you

If I can bring you back

How I've been thinkin' 'bout you
How I've been thinkin' of you

Oooo ooo oooo, oh yeah
Oooo ooo oooo
Oooo ooo oooo, oh yeah
Oooo ooo oooo
