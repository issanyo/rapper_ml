You, you can't say that I really didn't love you
There's a new, new, new, new, new
Louis bag for every time that I touched you

Quit acting like I'm the only one to blame, honey
Didn't hear you scream no when you was trickin' off my money
But you left me here to clean up your dirty laundry, oh yeah

So kiss that nigga, hug that nigga, love that nigga to death
Go ahead and please that nigga, feed that nigga
In time you'll see the problem's yourself

'Cause when love is your problem nothing can solve it
When love is the problem money can't solve it
When love is your problem nothing can solve it
When love is your problem no man can solve it
Love is your problem

Now you, you, you can't look back at all the shit you've done
To her love's a jail so, so, so, so, so, so, so she stays on the run

You give her money, she want love
You give her love, she's back at money
She'll run from man to man, making plans to plan
No secrets, y'all know who we're talkin' 'bout

'Cause when love is your problem and nothing can solve it
Love is the problem, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, no money can't solve it

When love is your problem and nothing can solve it
When love is the problem no man can solve it, nothing can solve it
Oh, nothing can solve it, solve it, oh, oh
Solve it, solve it, solve it, oh, oh

I wonder if you'll ever take the responsibility of what you've already done
By the time you figure out that she's not the one three years that went by
Nigga, you're done

You're done, you're done, you're done
Nigga, you're done, you're done, you're done
You're done, you're done, yeah you're done
You're done, you're done, yeah you're done
You can't have her back
