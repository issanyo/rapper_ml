[Verse 1: Adrienne Bailon & Sabrina Bryan]
Love always finds a way every single time
Once we learn to trust our heart
And now inside it feels right
Now we see who we are in a different light
We're not so far apart
Anything is possible

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kiely Williams]
With all the differences we're stronger here
Now the truth has been discovered, oh yeah
After all we've been through, now it's clear
That all of us, we share

[Chorus: The Cheetah Girls]
One world, one love, one in all
We're a circle together
One world, one heart, one song
Now and forever

[Post-Chorus: The Cheetah Girls]
Everybody celebrate
(Bring on the party, bring on the dance)
Time to let the music play
(The party never ends)
Everybody, every world
(Stand up and shout, say it loud)
Everyone around the world
(Come on and join in)

[Verse 2: Kiely Williams, Sabrina Bryan & *Adrienne Bailon*]
We're gathered here today
Everything just right
Cause when you give from your heart
The things you do come back to you
*Dare to be strong and brave, not afraid to try*
That's when we see who we are
The best of friends, and that's when

[Pre-Chorus 1: Kiely Williams & Adrienne Bailon]
With all the differences we're stronger here
Now the truth has been discovered, oh yeah
After all we've been through, now it's clear
We're all right to share

[Chorus: The Cheetah Girls]
One world, one love, one in all
We're a circle together
One world, one heart, one song
Now and forever

[Bridge: Deepti Daryanani + Rupak Ginn + Both]
Oh, I never knew that love would find a way to bring together both of us
Now inside, I know it's true
Cause what we have is meant to be
You'll let me be the real me
Together here is where we belong

[Chorus: The Cheetah Girls]
One world, one love, one in all
We're a circle together
One world, one heart, one song
Now and forever
One world, one love, one in all
We're a circle together
One world, one heart, one song
Now and forever
We're a circle together
Now and forever
One world
