[Verse 1]
You give him all my lovin
You gave him all my time
You're leaving me with nothin'
Not even a piece of mind
Oooo baby, oooo baby
You give him all my pleasure
You give him all my joy
You leave me with no aspirations
Your love I can't afford
Oooo baby, ooooo baby

[Bridge 1]
My heart's hurting but the bills due
Car note and the rent too
Know what you done but I'ma be a fool
You'd be wise to play it cool
So many things I could do to you
Black out, the cops come
Can't see my daughters
Can't see my sons
And I come home undone

[Hook]
Cause it's too early in the morning
To break up and then make out
It's way late for pretending
It's time you stop now
Or see me silhouette the sunset with my top down

[Post-Hook]
Top back see me ridin'
Million dollar Benz rims glidin'
Top down, gold watch
A hundred stacks, hand on my Glock
Top back see me ridin'
Million dollar Benz rims glidin'
Top down, gold watch
A hundred stacks, hand on my Glock

[Verse 2]
Even pretty girls get left too
Sugar honey, all the time
I used to love to undress you
Now I tell you, "No nevermind"
Ooo-ooo baby, ooo-ooo baby
Gave me one year of sunshine
You gave me four years of rain
It's been 40 days, 40 nights
Soak in the pain
Ooo-oo baby, ooo-ooo baby

[Bridge 2]
My heart's hurtin' but the bills due
Car note and the rent too
Baby girl life's hard enough
You're too fast, can't keep up
So many things I could do to you
Black out, cops come
Can't see my daughters
Can't see my sons
When I come home undone

[Hook 2]
Cause it's too early in the morning
To break up and then make out
It's way late for pretending
It's time to stop now
'Fore you see me silhouette the sunset with my top down

[Post-Hook]
Top back see me ridin'
Million dollar Benz rims glidin'
Top down, gold watch
A hundred stacks, hand on my Glock
Top back see me ridin'
Million dollar Benz rims glidin'
Top down, gold watch
A hundred stacks, hand on my Glock

[Hook 2]
'Cause it's too early in the morning
To break up and then make out
It's way late for pretending
It's time to stop now
'Fore you see me silhouette the sunset with my top down
'Cause it's too early in the morning
To break up and then make out
It's way late for pretending
It's time to stop now
'Fore you see me silhouette the sunset with my top down

[Post-Hook]
Top back see me ridin'
Million dollar Benz rims glidin'
Top down, gold watch
A hundred stacks, hand on my Glock
Top back see me ridin'
Million dollar Benz rims glidin'
Top down, gold watch
A hundred stacks, hand on my Glock
