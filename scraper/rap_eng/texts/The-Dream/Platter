[Intro]
Body on a platter
Ooh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I want your body on a platter
Take your heels on the side
And even though we not together, I want that make-up sex
In case we get together, you won't forget me
And that ass done got fatter, I ain’t seen you in a long time
And even though we never got together
We should make up for that
I wanna wake up to that, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, all day, all day, all day
Oh, all day, all day, all day
Radio killer

[Verse]
Girl, how could I forget that face?
Wonder how good it would taste
Thought you would've been my babe
Thought that you would swing my way
Let's make up for time that’s missed
Girl, this should be time well spent
All the things we could've been
Tonight, we gon' represent
Good love
Sex in the summertime with the windows open
And the wind is right, they can see through the blinds
Good, good love
Like sex in the summertime around 9 PM
We layin' here, stayin' here

[Chorus]
I want your body on a platter
Take your heels on the side
And even though we not together, I want that make-up sex
In case we get together, you won't forget me
And that ass done got fatter, I ain't seen you in a long time
And even though we never got together
We should make up for that
I wanna wake up to that, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, all day, all day, all day
Oh, all day, all day, all day

[Chorus]
(Baby, I want) I want your body on a platter
Take your heels on the side
And even though we not together, I want that make-up sex
In case we get together, you won't forget me
And that ass done got fatter, I ain’t seen you in a long time
And even though we never got together
We should make up for that
I wanna wake up to that, baby

[Post-Chorus]
Whoa, whoa, all day, all day, all day
Oh, all day, all day, all day
Radio killer

[Outro]
Girl, how could I forget that face?
Wonder how good it would taste
Thought you would’ve been my babe
Thought that you would swing my way
Let's make up for time that’s missed
Girl, this should be time well spent
All the things we could've been
Tonight, we gon' represent
Good love
Sex in the summertime with the windows open
And the wind is right, they can see through the blinds
