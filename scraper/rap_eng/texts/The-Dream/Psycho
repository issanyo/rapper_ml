[Intro]
Remember you

[Verse 1]
Girl, I'd hurt for you
Roaming in these padded walls of mine
Baby, we're stretched for time
I cling to you
Like a child in a smoke-filled room, hold on to you
And I swear you don't know this feeling
And I can kill it
I swear, girl, you don't know this feeling
I wish you could feel it
The sunlight's everywhere but where I want it to be
The darkness's everywhere I see

[Hook]
You're making me psycho, psycho, psycho
Can't let go, let go, let go
Everything I do brings me back to you, you, you, you
And every decision that you do, do, do, do
You make me psycho, psycho, psycho
Me and my padded walls

[Verse 2]
I should be in your car for you
But my echoes that I'm facing
And everything but contagious
Wanna run to you
And I don't know what's holding us back
In silence by this painted glass
Girl, you don't know this feeling
The pain is piercing
I swear, girl, you don't know this feeling
I'm illin'
The stars shine everywhere but where I want it to be
And space is everywhere between you and me

[Hook]
Girl, you're making me psycho, psycho, psycho
And I can't let go, let go, let go
Everything I do, it brings me back to you, you, you, you, you
And the decisions that you do, do, do
You make me psycho, psycho, psycho
Me and my padded walls

[Bridge]
Padded walls, these padded walls
Between me and you, these fuckin' padded walls, these padded walls
Even when you're near me, you can't hear me
Soundproof fixtures, quilted ceilings
Talking to myself in a room with no one else
And I tell you that I care but no one's there

Making me psycho, me psycho, psycho
