[Intro]
That's what she say when we're in bed
She's in love with our success
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know

[Chorus]
This the life
I got the baddest on my side
Niggas wasn't ready to die
Keep 100 clips in the ride
This the life
Keep a bad bitch on my side
And niggas wasn't ready to die
Keep 100 clips in the ride

[Post-Chorus]
This the life
That's what she said when we're in bed
That she's in love with our success
She'll never be the same
Just walk away, away, away

[Verse 1]
PYT, meet OG
She need me
C'est la vie
D-O-G on the C-A-T
Pounding that C-A-K-E
Run that shit like ATV
She always sorry
She never nervous
I keep on earnin', she keep it hot as the furnace
Can't be cheatin' if we both fuck up
It can't be cheatin' if we both blow up
Can't be cheatin' if we both blow up
It can't be cheatin' if we both show up
Not if we both show up
Ayy

[Chorus]
My nigga, this the life (She said when we're in bed)
I got the baddest on my side (In love with our success)
Niggas wasn't ready to die (Never be the same)
Keep 100 clips in the ride (100 clips in the ride)
(Away, away, away)
This the life (That's what she said when we're in bed)
Keep a bad bitch on my side (In love with our success)
And niggas wasn't ready to die (Never be the same)
Keep 100 clips in the ride (Just walk away, away, away)

[Post-Chorus]
(This that life)
That's what she said when we're in bed
That she's in love with our success
She'll never be the same
Just walk away, away, away

[Verse 2]
VVS is the radio killer
VVS is on the Rockefeller
VVS is on the Chinchilla
VVS is up in the building
She in the silk like (Ooh, lord)
You the last one (To know)
And we been kickin' it (Juno)

[Chorus]
My nigga, this the life (That's what she said when we're in bed)
I got the baddest on my side (In love with our success)
Niggas wasn't ready to die (Never be the same)
Keep 100 clips in the ride (100 clips in the ride)
This the life (That's what she said when we're in bed)
Keep a bad bitch on my side (In love with our success)
And niggas wasn't ready to die (Never be the same)
Keep 100 clips in the ride (Walk away, away, away)

[Post-Chorus]
That's what she said when we're in bed
That she's in love with our success
She'll never be the same
Just walk away, away, away
That's what she said when we're in bed
That she's in love with our success
She'll never be the same
Just walk away, away, away
