[Hook]
Why, why, why, why, why
Sound like Michael, don't it?
Why, why, why, why, why
Like Michael, don't it?

[Verse 1]
Fuck that other nigga
He say he love you
I just want to fuck you
Over the weekend
I want to hold that
He want to control that
I just want to console that
Over the weekend

[Bridge]
Oh and sure I can tell you how beautiful you are
Look at that face, that pretty little face
Oh and sure I can tell you how wonderful you are
Look at your face, that innocent face

[Pre-Hook]
But your booty this big
And your waist this small
And them heels gotchu walkin’ like your six feet tall
But tonight I’ll settle for half
Tomorrow he can have it all
Fuck a love song
I need to fuck you
All day, all night
This ain’t a love song
I need to fuck you
Don’t waste the time

[Hook]
She got me singing like
Why, why, why, why, why
She said it sounds like Michael, don't it?
Singing like
Why, why, why, why, why
She got me singing like
She said it sounds like Michael, don't it?

[Verse 2]
He want to kiss on it
I want to lick on it
Maybe put my dick on it
Over the weekend
He want a missionary
I want it from the back
And we can roll one, smoke one
Over the weekend

[Bridge]
Oh and sure I can tell you how beautiful you are
Look at that face, that pretty little face
Oh and sure I can tell you how wonderful you are
Should you hear that shit, everyday

[Pre-Hook]
Oh your booty this big
And your waist this small
And them heels gotchu walkin’ like your six feet tall
Tonight I’ll settle for half
Tomorrow he can have it all
Fuck a love song
I need to fuck you
All day, all night
This ain’t a love song
I need to fuck you
Don’t waste the time

[Hook]
She got me singing like
Why, why, why, why, why
She said it sounds like Michael, don't it?
Singing like
Why, why, why, why, why
She got me singing like
She said it sounds like Michael, don't it?

[Breakdown]
Oh Billie Jean
Put it on me
Workin’ that body

Oh Dirty Diana
Hop up in this phantom
Don’t be so shy
Make me your guy tonight, baby alright

[Hook]
She got me singing like
Why, why, why, why, why
