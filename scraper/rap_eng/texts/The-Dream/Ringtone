[Intro]
Polow Da Don
It's Kells!
Haters start your engines!

[Verse 1]
4'5'', looking fly
F-f-flossing in that white L.I
Shawty checking for a player
Like she wanna hop in with a player

Girlfriend on some hatin' shit
She like: "Shit, that's Kells, bitch!‚Äù
And then I stop like red light
Scooped em up like hitch-hike
Then I let them come with me
Step up in club with one on each sleeve
Doug E. Fresh kid bout to spend that cheese
And after that you know they gonna leave with me
We out of here, get them to the crib
Straight to the mansion, show em how I live
And you can tell that the sex is major
Cause only one day later

[Hook]
They got Kells on they ringtone
I hear Kells on they ringtone
They got Kells on they ringtone
Hold up your phone if you got me on your ringtone!
Hold up your phone if you got me on your ringtone!

[Verse 2]
Let me take you shopping, babe
Meet me right by Macy's, babe
Leave your purse, I'm crazy babe
Walk in and go crazy, babe

I'm telling you money ain't a thing to me
Kells "spin" it on you like wheels on Jeeps
Even after the mall to the Ritz we creep
Sex: put it on you like shoes on feets
Money stacked, club hoppin'
Leaning back, b-b-beat droppin'
All night, non-stoppin'
Club closed we p-p-parking-lottin'
Y'all going to the spot from here?
(Yes sir!)
Is there an after party after this?
(Yes sir!)
Are y'all taking them honies with?
(Yes sir!)
Are y'all on for some more freaky shit?
(Yes sir!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You play me in your car and you play me in your home
Now it's time to download Kells on your ringtone
From ghetto girls, college girls, all the way to strippers
To fine dro smokers and all the Henny sippers
Big chip spenders, big money tippers
At the bar taking shots with my niggas
No fake niggas, no hating niggas
But shots of Patron for all my real niggas
G-g-girls in the hotel getting it on
And they ain't leaving til six in the mornin'
Even superstar chicks too drunk to drive home
Wake up next day and, uh
