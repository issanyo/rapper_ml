[Introduction]
Ultra super random...
But I wanna know if...

[Chorus]
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
I would die to put my lips on it
I would love to rub my face in it
But you just gotta rub my face in it

[Post-Chorus]
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh

[Verse 1]
Madness
I think what we had was more so like magic
Eatin' it up, savage
How did this turn out so tragic?

[Pre-Chorus]
This is ultra super random
But I want to know if you're busy tonight
Girl we like Susan Sarandon
Girl we go back, let's go back like old times
Then she say she ain't in Atlanta
And then she killed a nigga with a text that read...

[Chorus]
It would have gotten better if you stayed with me
That's it, I know it's gone
I just wanna put my lips on it
Somebody's loving you
I just wanna put my face in it
Somebody's fuckin' you right
But you just gotta rub my face in it
There's nothing I could do

[Post-Chorus]
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh

[Verse 2]
Madness
Things that start hot always burn up the fastest
And you just eating it up, savage
How did this turn out so tragically?

[Pre-Chorus]
This is ultra super random
But I want to know if you're busy tonight
Girl we're like Susan Sarandon
Girl we go back, let's go back like the old times
Then she say she ain't in Atlanta
Where you at? Bet, bet
Then she killed a nigga with a text that read

[Post-Chorus]
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
Ahhh

[Bridge]
This is ultra super random
Susan Sarandon
I wanna know if you busy tonight

[Verse 3]
Madness
Things that start hot always burn up the fastest
And you just eating it up, savage
How did this turn out so tragically?

[Outro]
Gotten better if you stayed with me
She said, she said
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
She said, she said
Gotten better if you stayed with me
It woulda gotten better if you stayed with me
