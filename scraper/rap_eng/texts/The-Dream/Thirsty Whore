[Pre-Hook]
Time to see just who you are
Give anything to be a star
No shame, no fame, love me babe
Follow anything that walks away

[Hook]
Thirsty whore, how you doin'?
How is that goin'? Who are you screwing?
Where did that get you? A couple of bottles
A couple of million, a couple of flowers
No turnin' it back, what's on is on
Promiscuous, ambiguous
Now they turning they back, you’ve lost it all
Sippin' it up 'til it’s all gone
You thirsty whore
Thirsty whore
Thirsty whore
Poor girl

[Verse]
You need a father figure, put your tiny hands in mine
You’ll never see it, your love’s blind
There are times when I thought that you will maybe be okay
But no way, no way
She came to me despirately screamin' baby give me love
And I gave her brick after brick of it, that just wasn't enough
She better be moneyed up, she gotta be Louied down
She Hollywood forever, they know her all over town

[Pre-Hook]
Soon you'll see just who you are
Do anything to be a star
No shame, no fame, love you babe
Follow anything that walks her way

[Hook]
Thirsty whore, how you doin'?
How is that goin'? Who are you screwing?
Where did that get you? A couple of bottles
A couple of million, a couple of flowers
No turnin' it back, what's on is on
Promiscuous, ambiguous
Now they turning they back, you’ve lost it all
Sippin' it up 'til it’s all gone
You thirsty whore
Thirsty whore [X5]
Oh baby, baby

[Bridge x4]
You’ll never know what I miss
I’m sorry baby
I can make you feel what you can't feel
Yea yea
