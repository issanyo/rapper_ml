[Intro]
Cardinal sin, cardinal sin
Cardinal sin, cardinal sin

[Bridge]
We keep it lower than lower, lower than low, oh
Higher than dope, higher than dope, oh
I stay fresher than soap, fresher than soap, oh
I love what I love, I love what I love
I love what I love

[Verse 1]
Good girls dancing like strippers
In the club like liquor, tryna hold that liquor, oh
Pretty girls acting all nasty, cool girls getting ratchet
Looking like, "Just ask me", oh
Black girls starting to act bad, nobody else matters
Her ass is the fattest, oh
But she's seeing a friend of mine
Insert the punchline, punchline

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We keep it lower than lower, lower than low, oh
We keep it higher than dope, higher than dope, oh
Stay fresher than soap, fresher than soap, oh
I love what I love, I love what I love
I love what I love

[Verse 2]
Girl, I can just chill in this, fucking up her lipstick
Sure you wanna risk this? Oh, yup, here we go
Said they tryna fix it, God as a witness
Sounds like we missed that rolling that window up
Can I get a late night, we laid up in the late night
Say she got a lot of lefts and she wanna make rights
She wanna be mine, said she wanna spend time
Oh, punchline, punchline

Helpless
Baby, we're helpless
Baby, we're helpless
