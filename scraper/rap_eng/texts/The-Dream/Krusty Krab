Yo, it's "Fuck Curbs" come through with a Ford Focus
Flyer than four locusts, it's that straight to the morgue flowin'
Your rap game funny as excerpts from George Lopez
Said I'm more focused with every word spoken
I leave my fans speechless, so now you're chokin'
Said it's The Dream behind the boards crafting more dopeness
And I'll be waitin' for the day that EN Records' doors open
Keep slingin' crack 'til the day those doors closin'
Until then I'll run the game 'til I got sore toes then
I'll leave you whores hopeless, look (x2)

It's the Krusty Krab, motherfucking Krusty Krab
And I'm serving up beats like the fucking Krusty Krab
It's the Krusty Krab, motherfucking Krusty Krab
And I'm serving up beef like the fucking Krusty Krab, yo

Numerous, Q's.. Yeah

Beamer boys boy, sike I'm swerving in a Mazda
Don't got my license yet I'm swerving round in nada
Pretty girls up in the cut, live it up you can't stop us
NE got that crisp bread, nah that isn't matzo
Look bruh I'm livin' for my family and my mama
The second dude to rap these rhymes behind Kiwi with Mu Fasa
Drums are sounding sexy, call that Tom-Tom foolery
Bumping OF, white, they want nothing to do with me
Fuck it though, Numerous Q's still bumpin' "Uncle Al"
Listen kids, this is it EN's at the function now
