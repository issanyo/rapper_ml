[Intro]
Yeah, you need to turn this up
All the ladies report to the dance floor
Yeah, it's just you and me
Feel that?
You know what's gonna happen once I get you over here you, right?
You scared, yeah

[Verse 1]
Baby, I can't wait to get you up in my room
Baby, first, let me go and set up the mood
Now, I'm gon’ do you up and then I'm gon’ do you down
I'm gon’ have that body, baby, floating all around
And all you gotta do is get close to me
Bring it all to me, it's going down

[Chorus]
We ain't having sex, we're making moments that will outlast the world
And this ain't sex, this is the symbol of the true makings in love
I'm open all night
Oh, baby, oh, look at what you're doing to me
Makes me believe
I'm not blind, I see everything you giving to me
Oh, baby

[Bridge]
This is love, this is real, this is how you make me feel
This is love, this is real, this is how you make me feel

[Verse 2]
Baby, I can't wait to deliver you
(Like a FedEx box, baby girl, sign your own name)
Baby, I can't wait to remember you
(Can I make the first phone call on your birthday?)
How I did you up and then how I did you down
Yeah, I had that pretty body floating all around
Thinking back to when you were close to me
And I thought that we would never come down

[Chorus]
We ain't having sex, we're making moments that will outlast the world
And this ain't sex, this is the symbol of the true makings in love
I'm open all night
Oh, baby, oh, look at what you did to me
Make me a believer
I'm not blind, I see everything you giving to me
Ah, babe
Ooh, baby

[Bridge]
Feels so good, I can't get carried away
Need to stop and think before it's too late
I can't, it feels so good inside
I guess we'll turn this moment into a lifetime
Cut loose, bring it back, bring it back

[Chorus]
We ain't having sex, we're making moments that will outlast the world
And this ain't sex, this is the symbol of the true makings in love
