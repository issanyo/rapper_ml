[Verse 1] Come and walk me to the car
I wanna see you
From here to there, can't help but stare
Give me some insight
No bullshit, a real conversation
Put me on your block
Im moving in
I would love to be love's neighbor
If you dont mind, I dont mind
Do anything for just a fraction of you
And I know this may sound stalkerish
But that's because you are the shit
Alright, if I'm attention be my center
If you're Spring, I'm Summer
If you're Fall, I'm Winter
Speaking of Winter

[Hook] Be my February Love, Love, Love
My love
Be my February Love, Love, Love

[Verse 2] Give me your love, give me your heart
Promise we'll never be apart
I know you used to them niggas saying whatever Promise that we'll always be together
Take a picture, I'll buy the frame
Let me change your car, then change your name
You are my destiny, child
Now lets make us a destiny child
Girl rock with me
Quench the curiosity
I'm positive that we are meant to be
Don't let them spoil it with negativity
See we are the beautiful ones
Baby come and step in to my sun
Before the cold takes it away
Come and

[Hook] Be my February Love, Love, Love
Girl
Be my February Love, Love, Love

[Rap Verse] Phantom in the driveway
Sittin on the courtside
Shawty I ain't new to this
You better get used to this
30 foot ceilings, life style appealing
Check my 09' taxes I made a killin'
Haters wanna kill 'em, real niggas feel 'em
Dream ain't on credits, they musta got a feeling
Ha, he so silly
Dont mean to be rude
But some of these niggas just ain't got a clue
Quality love, follow me girl
These niggas so scandalous
These comedian niggas should do stand up
These break up before holidays ass niggas
Them leasin' Benz's, pretending ass niggas
Hell yea I already told y'all niggas
I'm a motha fuckin' hater
Especially when y'all niggas lying about
Y'all motha fuckin' paper
He poppin champagne
Thrown up, bet your man all up on the TV screen Dont own your publishin'
Hell naw you ain't got more money than me
Just help me understand, help me comprehend
Matter of fact dont tell me shit
She know you're full of it
Its so much that I can say
But she pulling me away
Stay in your lane
They like

[Hook] My February Love, Love, Love
She loves
My February Love, Love, Love
