[Verse 1]
Who you know put them grits with them eggs with the bacon on the side
And who you know wash your clothes and put them back in the dresser like I
And who you know got your back like i do
And who you know put it on ya like i do
Who you know get up early in the morning just to make sure you on time, for your flight

[Pre-Chorus]
And now your saying that you wanna leave me
After all the things we went through
Just remember one thing while your leaving
They don't make them like me (cause you know)

[Chorus]
A girl like me is hard to find, hard to find, hard to find (yeah)
A girl like me is hard to find, hard to find, hard to find
So go head and waste your time with them other girls
Just know that they got nothing on me
A girl like me is hard to find, hard to find, hard to find

[Verse 2]
And who you know get the wrinkles out ya button up shirt like me
And who know clean your house after Monday night football like me (me x 3)
Who you know gon' love you more than i do
Who you know gon' protect you like i do
Who you know stay with you through thick and thin
You were my homie, my lover, you were my best friend

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
