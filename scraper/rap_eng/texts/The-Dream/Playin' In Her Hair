[Intro]
Like naw' that's my girl right?
She ain't my girl; that's my nigga
That's my nigga right there (x6)

[Verse 1]
Before the sex pop off she rub my back
She never gone for long, she be right back
And she keep a bag full of goodies
Her love's baked up like Pillsbury cookies
It ain't about the Benz or the money
She's my bee I'm her honey
Man that's my homie
And she got my playin' in her hair

[Hook]
And I fell like an out-work boxer in the very first round
Tried to keep my guard up, but she caught me now I'm going down
Got me playin' in her hair

[Chorus]
Got me playin' in her hair, hair, hair (x8)

[Verse 2]
See I love this girl, she's all I need
And right now anything she want
She can get it from me, me, me
And she do her thing, when I come around
And even when I'm not back in the spot
Shawty hold me down, down, down

(Repeat Verse 1)
(Repeat Hook)
(Repeat Chorus)

[Outro]
All my girls in the club, club
Gon' get ya hands up
Let me get a "ay!"
And if ya sippin' on Patron
Frames on ya face get ya hands up
Let me get a "ay!"

(2x)
Let me get a "ay!"
Let me get a "ay!"
Let me get a "ay!"
A-T-L-A-N-T-A-G-A is where I stay
