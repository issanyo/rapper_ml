[Verse 1]
I’m always lost, deep in your eyes
You can tell me a million lies, and I’d believe it
I’d listen thoroughly time after time
‘Cos getting away with loving you is already my crime
You make me want to do what I’m supposed to do
Once a choosey lover now they don’t compare to you
I’ll do whatever always come back to me
Holding you close loving you endlessly

[Hook]
It’s so hard, to find someone like you
I’ve searched on the stars, a million moons
Just to find someone like you

Uh, Uh

[Verse 2]
Say whatever you want, you’re in charge
I’ll be right here when you need me, I won’t barge
In
Take your time I won’t be far
As long as I’m close, to where you are
When I’m with you, you are my world (my world)
I’m in awe, you’re my girl (my girl)
What did I do to deserve this thing
I’m holding you close loving you endlessly (endlessly)

[Hook]
It’s so hard, to find someone like you
I’ve searched on the stars, a million moons
Just to find someone like you

Uh, Uh

[Bridge]
Some dreams can come true
Fruition, (Yeah)
Fruition, (Me and you baby baby)
Fruition
Now that I got you I’ll never let you go

[Hook]
It’s so hard, to find someone like you
I’ve searched on the stars, a million moons
Just to find someone like you

It’s so hard, to find someone like you
I’ve searched on the stars, a million moons
Just to find someone like you

[Verse 3]
And I’ll never let you go
Girl you’re embedded in my heart
You’re tattooed to my soul
Can’t tear us apart
You’re the dearest thing in my mind
It’s been so hard to find, someone, like you
I will never let you go

[Hook]
It’s so hard, to find someone like you
I’ve searched on the stars, a million moons
Just to find someone like you

Uh, Uh

[Outro]
Dreams can come to
Fruition…
Fruition
