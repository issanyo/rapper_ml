[Intro: The-Dream]
Yessir
You what you deserve

[Verse 1: Naomi]
Little boy
It's gon' take more than game
To get me to change my name
And you betta not be lame, be lame, lame, lame)
And little boy
It takes more than a car
To get me to go that far
I ain't cheap little buddy, I'm a star
Nigga, I'm a star!

[Pre-Chorus:]
(Ooh) Gotta know what you lookin' at
What you lookin' at
If you want me to holla back
You gotta know when to stop talking
If you really wanna play in my lane

[Chorus:]
You gets nothin'
Unless that nigga's on point
In the bed betta know what you doin'
Let the washer and the dryer keep the coins
I need dollars
And that's trill
Unless that nigga pay bills
And unless that nigga do deals
Unless he got my wrist on chill
I'm for real
Betta be on point
On point (x6)
Betta be on point
On point (x6)
Gotta be on point
On point (x6)
Gotta be on point
On point (x4)
Betta be on

[Verse 2: Binkie]
Little boy
Gon need more than a check
To get me to show you some respect
A phone call when you late don't text, and don't flex nigga
Listen, little boy
Don't try to show out
When your little boys come to the house
Or I'll walk around this bitch in my Louis Vuitton heels with my ass hanging out (Ow!)

[Pre-Chorus]
(Ooh) Gotta know what you lookin' at
What you lookin' at
If you want a bitch to holla back
You gotta know when to stop talking
'cause I do
If you wanna play in my lane

[Chorus]
