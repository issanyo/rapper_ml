Yessir

[Verse 1]
Me and my niggas up in this bitch
You and your bitches up in this bitch
Oh, my Mary Magdalene
Be my savior for my sins
I trust you, my Bible
With arms I can lie to
Paparazzo goddess, Da Vinci goddess

[Pre-Hook]
Got an angel on my dick
Devils waiting to kill my life
Somehow she ease the pain, get me by, I'm fine
And I'm in heaven, girl, you bring me heaven
Say Mary

[Hook]
Blasphemy

[Bridge]
Me and my niggas up in this bitch
You and your bitches up in this bitch
Me and my niggas up in this bitch
You and your bitches up in this bitch

[Verse 2]
Three shades of me
Rolling up under that tree
Love me like I'm Adam
Keep your eye on Eve
Blasphemy, blasphemy
Tonight, save me from my sins
Once again

[Pre-Hook]
I got an angel on my dick
Devils waiting to end my life
Somehow easing my pain, get me by, I'm fine
And I'm in heaven, girl, you bring me heaven
Amen (Say Mary)

[Hook]
(With you them) girls like, girls like
While I'm with you them girls like
Feel nothing, I feel nothing

[Verse 3]
With the sweetest girls I'm nothing
Run right through my years
Exploring my brain
Soak up all my tears
Sweetest thing I've ever known
Rebuild my heart
No trust for these niggas
Got no trust for these bitches
Wicked things, they prey on me
Pray that your wings stay on me
No trust for these niggas
Got no trust for these bitches

[Hook]
God damn our blasphemy
That's it, baby, blasphemy
That's it, baby, blasphemy
Blasphemy
