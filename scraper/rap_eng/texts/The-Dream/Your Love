[Verse 1]
Boy, you don't know how much I like it
It's so hot, nice to bite it
Just a little, know you like it
I'll do whatever you want
Something 'bout you so enticin'
Even when I try to fight it
Knock me out like Michael Tyson
I'll do whatever you want

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I'm never letting you go baby
I love you so baby
Love me the most baby
Ain't going nowhere like froze baby
Do whatever you want, baby
And everything you do, baby
Be whatever you need

Cause your love makes me feel like

Yeah baby you got me
Yeah my body's like Bugatti
You know everybody wants mine
You got everything they don't
You get all my lovin'
All my kisses when we're huggin'
MC Hammer, girls can't touch this
I got everything they don't

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I'm never letting you go baby

Ain't going nowhere like froze baby
Do whatever you want, baby
And everything you do, baby

Whenever you go I get lonely
You'll be believe how much I'm missing you
