[Verse]
Seem like everybody out here lookin' for their miracle
And I've been shootin' up on units, swear to God that you won't tell a soul, oh
What love got to do with it, don't make me choose (Don't make me choose)
Who needs Jesus (Who needs Jesus)
When I got you? (When I got you?)
You hell Mary (You hell Mary)
But you're my muse (But you're my muse)
If I'm the devil (If I'm the devil)
What that make you? (What that make you?)

[Chorus]
You hell Mary
You hell Mary

[Outro]
Sacrificing everything for me
You do that for me (For me)
Sacrificing everything for you (For you)
You ever seen an angel fall from the sky at night?
You ever seen an angel fall from the sky at night?
You ever seen an angel fall from the sky at night?
Have you ever seen an angel fall from the sky at night?
