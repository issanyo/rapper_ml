[Intro]
Superlove
Superlove

[Verse 1]
I'm sophisticated, super classy, Uncle Luke, freak, nasty
I'm tryna make ya my baby daddy
Got me bouncing on it, I'm acrobatic

[Pre-Chorus]
I want you, I want you, I want you to be my baby
Settle down, we'll settle down then give you a baby
Put it down, boy, put it down and make me act all crazy
I might let you change me, boy I can arrange it, yeah

[Chorus]
They will never love you babe (they will never love you)
Like I love you babe
Baby, say you'll never take my love away
Say you'll never take my love away
They will never touch you babe (they will never touch you)
Like I touched you babe (they will never, no, no)
Baby, say you promise it will never change
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know
You know, you know
