All the single ladies

Now put your hands up

Up in the club, just broke up
I'm doing my own groove thing
You decided to dip, and now you wanna trip
'Cause another brother notice me

I'm up on him, he up on me
Don't pay him any attention
I cried my tears for three good years
You can't be mad at me

C'ause if you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it

Whoa-oh-oh

Got gloss on my lips and a man on my hips
Holds me tighter than my Dereon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
Couldn't care less what you think

I need no permission, and did I mention
Don't pay him attention
'Cause you had your turn, and now you're gonna learn
What it really feels like to miss me

If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it
Don't be mad once you see that he want it
'Cause If you like it then you shoulda put a ring on it

Whoa-oh-oh

Don't, don't treat me to these things of the world
I'm not your kinda girl, your love is what I prefer
What I deserve is a man that makes me, takes me
Delivers me to destiny, infinity and beyond

Pull me into your arms
And say I'm the one you want
If you don't
You'll be alone
And like a ghost
I'll be gone

All the single ladies
All the single ladies

Now put your hands up
