[Intro: R. Kelly]
Got a surprise for y’all

[Verse 1: R. Kelly]
Well, shawty listen
It’s the remix
No other than
Your boyfriend Kellz
And we roll up to the club like (Ay, Ay)
And we all off in the club like (Ay, Ay)
Tell security to move the ropes back
Let the chicks in
We in the VIP poppin’ bottles
And I’m off that Patrón
Clownin’ and carryin’ on
I’m so drunk that ugly girls look like supermodels
However, I’m in the building
And I’m ballin’ how a baller do
So many hunnies in the building
Y’all know I’m planning how a player do
I walk up to one girl
And she’s got her friend wit’ her
Nothin’ to a real nigga
Baby, I’m a go getta
The girl I meet got a nice booty
Other girl’s is much bigger
Ask me how I do ‘em both
I’m Kellz, bitch
Go figure

[Chorus: R. Kelly + (The-Dream)]
(Oooooooo, Ooooo) (Ay)
They wanted Kellz on the remix
(Oooooooo, Ooooo) (Ay)
And haters wanna hate ‘cause I’m the shit (Ay)
I’m the shit (Ay)
Kellz is the shit (Ay)
I’m the shit (Ay)
And shawty is the shit (Ay)
She’s the shit (Ay)
Together we the shit (Ay)
We the shit (Ay)
Oh oh

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
It must be the American Dream
I gotta show my respect, so Kelly had to go first
Gonna put my shawty to bed after this verse
Lay on carpets all up in the Phantom
I’m all up in her head like dandruff
Man, shawty so cool
Booty so cute
Shawty is the shit
Oh, I is too
So you can call your man and tell him that you ain’t coming back
I got pockets full of stacks
She staying where she at
Shit happens when you don’t treat your girl right
Put it on her ass, all it take is a night
Now she ‘round here doing everything I like, I like
(Ay) If shawty keep it trill wit’ you
You should tip her, you should tip her
(Ay) But if she gone all night and got more money than you
Hmmmm, she just might be a stripper

It was Keisha (From the Chi)
Sonya (From the A)
Tonya (From Houston)
Monique (From The Bay)
Niecy (From Seattle)
KiKi (From New York)
Now I see you at 23, all I can say

(Girl, damn!) Oooooooo…
(Girl, damn!) Oooooooo…
It’s Dream and Kelly on the remix
Oooooooo, Ooooo
You ain’t gotta say it, shawty right there is the shit (Ay)
