[Intro]
If this ain't the realest thing I've ever wrote
When I start to sing, I pray that God make me choke
If this ain't the realest thing I've ever wrote
When I start to sing, I hope God makes me choke

[Verse 1]
You might wanna say - regardless, he's heartless
Caught up, drugged out
There I go putting words in your mouth
You wanna say he's a no good, son of a bitch
He'll never know what love truly is
You wanna say he ain't never been nothing
He's a monster, who would even want him anyway?
You wanna say I'm the lowest thing in the world
Right next to the snake
But what they won't say
Is when you need help, who you call?
I was there to help you fight 'em all
What they won't say is
I've slaved for my children like it's no tomorrow
I did it all, even through my sorrow
What they won't say is
I've already bought houses for both of my daughters
What a wonderful father
What they won't say is
I've changed every life of every nigga around me
Even the niggas that used to clown me

[Bridge]
Some days I'm Superman
But sometimes even my cape
Needs dry-cleaning every once in a while
Sometimes I make it through without a pastor
But sometimes even I can use some preaching too
I'm just a child
Some days I'm full of positive energy
Other days I'm tired and I need help just to smile
Most days I could lead us to victory
Bu some days I need you to lead me
I can hear my mother say from the other land
This too shall pass
I can hear my father say from the other land
This too shall pass

[Hook]
Hate me when I'm up, love me when I'm down
Appreciate the good and bad until I'm underground
Love me when I'm tall, love me when I fall
Crucify me if you want but I won't stop loving y'all

[Verse 2]
What they wanna say is how I don't give a damn about anybody
Who the fuck you kidding? Yeah right
They wanna say I'm selfish, I wasn't there when you was helpless
Yeah I was, whatever
They wanna say that I'm trash, I'm broken glass
I'm all that
But what they they they they they won't say
Is that he's fair and that he's always there
At the same motherfuckin time he said he was gonna be there
They won't say is that I take love seriously
What they won't say is that I care like you wouldn't believe
So if I hurt you I'm sorry, I didn't mean no harm
But I really gave it my all

[Bridge]
Some days I'm Superman
But sometimes even my cape
Needs dry-cleaning every once in a while
Sometimes I make it through without a pastor
But sometimes even I can use some preaching too
I'm just a child
Some days I'm full of positive energy
Other days I'm tired and I need help just to smile
Most days I could lead us to victory
Bu some days I need you to lead me
I can hear my mother say from the other land
This too shall pass
I can hear my father say from the other land
This too shall pass

[Hook]
Hate me when I'm up, love me when I'm down
Appreciate the good and bad until I'm underground
Love me when I'm tall, love me when I fall
Crucify me if you want but I won't stop loving y'all

[Outro]
If this ain't the realest thing I've ever wrote
When I start to sing, I pray that God make me choke
If this ain't the realest thing I've ever wrote
When I start to sing, I hope God makes me choke
I'm only human
And you're only human
