[Verse 1]
You make me want it, want it, want it
Early in the morning, morning, morning
I can use another round, another round
Come take it, take it take it
Ooh we baby, baby, baby
Love how that sounds, that sound

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I want it, I need it
Say you never let me go
If we go over and opver, just thought Id let you know
How I feel when you're not around, falloing for you more
My anything, my everything, I'll never tell you no

[Chorus]
And you ain't going nowhere, nowhere nohow, no way
No bae, no bae
I'm crazy over you, it's too late, it's too late
Cause this ain't going nowhere, nowhere nohow, no way
Oh bae, oh bae
I'm crazy over you it's too late, it's too late
Oh bae

[Verse 2]
Silly, silly, silly, like Philly, really
All because I'm missing you, ,look at what I do
Trippin' trippin' trippin'
I'm flippin' flippin', flippin' out on you
Look what your love made me do

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I want it, I need it
Say you never let me go
If we go over and opver, just thought Id let you know
How I feel when you're not around, falloing for you more
My anything, my everything, I'll never tell you no

[Chorus]
And you ain't going nowhere, nowhere nohow, no way
No bae, no bae
I'm crazy over you, it's too late, it's too late
Cause this ain't going nowhere, nowhere nohow, no way
Oh bae, oh bae
I'm crazy over you it's too late, it's too late
Oh bae

[Bridge]
And I'm all about you, and I know you're all about me too
And I buried your love in my heart
And no matter what they say, can't tell me nothing bout my baby
When your love is side by side, you can't tell it apart
And I'm all about you, and I know you're all about me too
And I buriid your love in my heart
And no matter what they say, can't tell me nothing bout my baby
When your love is side by side, you can't tell it apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh I want it, I need it
Say you never let me go
If we go over and opver, just thought Id let you know
How I feel when you're not around, falling for you more
My anything, my everything, I'll never tell you no

[Chorus]
And you ain't going nowhere, nowhere nohow, no way
No bae, no bae
I'm crazy over you, it's too late, it's too late
Cause this ain't going nowhere, nowhere nohow, no way
Oh bae, oh bae
I'm crazy over you it's too late, it's too late
Oh bae
