I wear these Seven jeans
But baby they don't wear me
I keep it covered up, uh
Cause I'm a lady
I know how to show a little somethin, somethin
You can't see what's under there
Cause I'm a grown woman
I'm so sexy
Remain a mystery
Cause everybody always want what they can't see
And what they can't have
And what they can't grab
And what they can't buy
And baby that's me!

Luda!
I ain't lyin I think I'm in love with a grown woman
She stay stuntin
Got sweet lovin and home-cooking
Been known to make her moan
Til the break of dawn
A little lady in the street
But at home I give her a grown whuppin, yeah
I hit the jeweler and make a chain
Flawless white diamonds and I put that e'rythang
Mami stylin, she knows how to accessorize
And we some stairmasters
I make her get her exercise
Wit yo sexy thighs
Body got me mesmerized
Little boys is scurred
And other guys be petrified
But I can handle it
Scramble it and
Dismantle it
Manage to get managed before I late night candle it
Blow em out
Show em out
And show em how it's done
And ain't no need to venture out
She's my only one
Yep I love my grown woman and she love me back
Made me a grown a** man
Now what you think of that?

Now keep-keep-keep-keep
Keep, keep it right there
