[Verse 1]
I was dreaming we were running
From a city burning
Down, down, down
Made a break, a new escape
And let the world crash
Down, down, down
(Wooh!)
Now there's a piece of me
Tells me I shouldn't leave
Everytime I see your face
(Everytime I see your face)
Because everytime
You come around
Love, you take my breath away

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just wanna breathe until
I take you in
I never want you to leave until
I take you in
(But the truth is)

[Chorus]
She has no idea
(No idea)
That I'm even here
(That I'm even here)
She has no idea
(No idea)
That I'm even here
(That I'm even here)

[Verse 2]
Get a grip
Slip and trip
Over clumsy careless
Words, words, words
Paper thin fingerprints
Under softly spoken
Verse, verse, verse
Now there's so much of me
Telling me not to leave
Everytime I see your face
(Everytime I see your face)
Because everytime
You come around
(How do you take my breath away?)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I just wanna breathe until
I take you in
I never want you to leave until
I take you in
(But the truth is)

[Chorus]
She has no idea
(No idea)
That I'm even here
(That I'm even here)
She has no idea
(No idea)
That I'm even here
(That I'm even here)

[Bridge]
She's so close when I'm so far away
When I'm so far away
Let me dream, let me stay
She's so close when I'm so far away
When I'm so far away
I can sleep, I can dream, I can change
She has no idea
But I'm so far away (That I'm even here)
She has no idea
Now I'm so far away (That I'm even here)

[Chorus]
She has no idea
(No idea)
That I'm even here
(That I'm even here)
She has no idea
(No idea)
That I'm even here
(That I'm even here)

She has no idea
(No idea)
That I'm even here
(That I'm even here)
She has no idea
(No idea)
That I'm even here
(That I'm even here)

[Outro]
She has no idea
Dea, dea
She has no idea
Dea, dea
She has no idea
Dea, dea
She has no idea
Dea, dea
She has no idea
