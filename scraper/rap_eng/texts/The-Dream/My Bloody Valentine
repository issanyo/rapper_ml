I can smell your voice
I can taste your face
Can't wait till it goes away
But oh, I know to let it go
Don't let it show
Hurts so much and no one knows

And no one knows
And no one knows
And no one knows
And no one knows

I slept in your arms
That sweet charm only brought me harm
I will cry and cry for you to change
But the more we change
We stay the same
Kept my mouth closed
No one knows

And no one knows
And no one knows
And no one knows
And no one knows
And no one knows

Eh, I lived my life for you
And all you did was make me a fool
Knowing you just took and took
Boy, you're so cruel

But shame on me
For trying to play it all cool
You made my wrongs look so right
The days I spent crying about you lasted through the night

Oh I heard you down
I stayed around at the door in my Christian Dior
Everyone knows
They know, they know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know

You
Take this loss
Forgetting you won't take that long
Now I, won't need your help
See I can do thaaaat all by myself

Everyone knows
They know, they know
Everyone knows
They know, they know
Everyone knows
They know, they know
Everyone knows
They know, they know

They know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know
They know, they know
