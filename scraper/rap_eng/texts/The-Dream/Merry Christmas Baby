[Chorus]
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Well, I said merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice, yes she did

[Verse 1]
You gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
And now I'm living in paradise

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You gave me a diamond ring for Christmas
And now I'm living, living in paradise
Sing it one more time Willie, hey yeah

[Hook]
I'm feeling mighty fine, baby
I've got some good music on my radio
I said Jessie, I'm feeling mighty fine, baby
I've got some good music on my radio

[Verse 3]
And I'm going to kiss you right here
While you're standing beneath the mistletoe
Merry Christmas, baby

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
And I'm going to kiss you, baby
While you're standing, standing beneath the mistletoe

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
For the things that you give me
Feels like I'm living in paradise, hey yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
