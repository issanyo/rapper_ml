[Intro]
I want everything
Manicure, pedicure
Yeah, baby, let me do it
Make me a bad girl, let me do it
Damn right, I need everything
Manicure, pedicure
Go on, baby, let me do it
Can't make me come, baby, let me do it

[Verse 1]
Babe, I need you to touch it right
That first starlight in my life
Feel you make me do the right thing
When I say I'm done for the night
Do something, make me change my mind
All night long, went through the wrong thing

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me a million lies
Broken hearts a million times
Come and make me feel sublime
Come refine this heart of mine

[Chorus]
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Come make me feel
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Feel something real
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
I wanna feel like I felt
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
For the very first time
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Come make me feel
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Feel something real
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
I wanna feel like I felt
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
For the very first time

[Verse 2]
You know exactly how I feel when I'm around you
And you know exactly what to do when you're around me
Baby, rock my body, don't sleep
And go on, be all you can be
I'll be everything you need

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me a million lies
Broken hearts a million times
Come and make me feel sublime
Come refine this heart of mine (Ooh)

[Chorus]
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Come make me feel
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Feel something real
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
I wanna feel like I felt
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
For the very first time
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Come make me feel
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Feel something real
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
I wanna feel like I felt
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
For the very first time

[Bridge]
I can't get enough of your love
Baby tell me that it's real
Boy, kick it to me straight, don't lie
'Cause I'm in too deep
I can't sleep, can't eat
I need you baby
I need you baby

[Chorus]
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Come make me feel
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Feel something real
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
I wanna feel like I felt
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
For the very first time
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Come make me feel
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
Feel something real
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
I wanna feel like I felt
(Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me)
For the very first time
