I think it's funny all the games you play
But i dont play with you
So why you choose to play with me that way
All i do i treat you with the up most
I need the same
So if you're looking for the ratchetness
Don't look my way

Baby imma love you
But you ain't gotta love me Back
I'll do everything i say i do for you
To show my love just can't be matched

So when your out late night blowing other bills
The most you do that bs the more i keep it real
Go ahead and lose yourself ima stay attached
It's one thing in respect is when we dont react
Thats that power back

He used to stay gone now he's coming home
Thats that power back
And when i stop calling he's on my phone
That's that power back
And when it seems i don't care he's right there
That's that power back
I'll just sit back and watch you do it to yourself
That's that power back

I love you too much to leave you
I love me too much to ever be you
Said the clock strikes at
Least two times in a day
And when we're right we're unbreakable
Just need some time to get us back in love

Baby imma love you
But you ain't gotta love me Back
I'll do everything i say i do for you
To show my love just can't be matched

So when your out late night blowing other bills
The most you do that bs the more i keep it real
Go ahead and lose yourself ima stay attached
It's one thing in respect is when we dont react
Thats that power back

He used to stay gone now he's coming home
Thats that power back
And when i stop calling he's on my phone
That's that power back
And when it seems i don't care he's right there
That's that power back
I'll just sit back and watch you do it to yourself
That's that power back

I gave you everything that you wanted
I gave everything that you could need
I won't ever ask you for nothing
But you're love is what i need

He used to stay gone now he's coming home
That's that power back
And when i stop calling he's on my phone
That's that power back
And when it seems i don't care he's right there
That's that power back
I'll just sit back and watch you do it to yourself
That's that power back
