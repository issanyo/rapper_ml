[Intro]
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am

[Verse 1]
He been gone since 3:30
Been coming home lately at 3:30
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot, and baby, you gon' get it
Now I ain't tripping, I ain't twisted
I ain't demented, well, just a lil' bit
I'm kickin' asses, I'm taking names
I'm on flame, don't come home, babe

[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man

[Verse 2]
I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire
I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested
And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw

[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man

[Break]
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
Blow this, blow this, I'ma blow this, blow this, oh
Blow this, blow this, I'ma blow this, blow this, oh
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin
Breakin', breakin', breakin', breakin

[Chorus]
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man
I'm breakin' dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'ma fight a man tonight, I'ma fight a man tonight
I'ma fight a man, a man, a man
A man, a man, a man
