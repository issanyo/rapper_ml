[Verse 1]
Started out talking right here
Putting it down like a motherfucking mack
Selling candy all up in my ear
She wanna be down like the Ds on the Lac
Slow dancing in the club, her diamonds look like rainbows
She grinding on my dick, she looking for the pot of gold
We hop up in that AMG and D, we in the Westin
She putting moves on me, I coulda swore shorty's a wrestler

[Pre-Hook]
Talking all that shit
Soon as I hit
Now I got her talking like this

[Hook]
(In a falsetto) She like, ooh, ooh, baby
Ah, ah, ah, ooh (ooh, ooh)
(In a falsetto) She like, ooh, ooh, baby
Ah, ah, ah, ooh
(In a falsetto) She like, ooh, ooh, baby
Ah, ah, ah, ooh
(In a falsetto) She like, ooh, ooh, baby
Ah, ah, ah, ooh  (ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
She's telling all her homies I'm the real deal
Every time she leave the crib, shorty be coming right back
She talking dirty all up in my ear (ear)
And I'm finna put this dog right on her kitty cat
I wasn't gon' show you up, but then you got that liquor in ya
Calling last night a fluke, acting like she didn't remember
I hopped up out that linen, I'm finna defend my title
Finna put your ass to bed, tell me, which way would you like it?

[Pre-Hook]
Talking all that shit
Soon as I hit

[Bridge]
She said it feels like her very first time
She said it feels like her very first time
Grind it, grind it, grind it, baby

[Outro]
It's all over now, you can come back down (Woosah)
We can talk in this key right here (Woosah)
But any time you want me to take you up
Baby, jump on this elevator, promise there ain't nothing greater
(Eh) Take a shower (eh) Let's take a shower (eh, eh)
Let's take a shower (eh) Let's take a shower, eh
Let's take a shower (eh, eh)
Meet you right back here in a half an hour (Eh, eh, eh)
(Ella, ella)
(Ella, ella)
