[Chorus: Rihanna]
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Breakdown: Rihanna]
'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Drop: Sick Individuals]
