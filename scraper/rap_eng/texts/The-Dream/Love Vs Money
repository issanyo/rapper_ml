[Intro]

Mama
I wanted to take you home to my mama
I wanted to take you home to my mama
I wanted to take you home to my mama, but no ( but no)

[Verse 1]

What we had was awsome
Till he came in took you out my life
I even had thoughts of makin her my wife
And I thought that this dough would keep her by my side
(by my side)
I can't call her even tho right now the boys in need
But needin her won't bring her back to me
I can't belive this girl ain't by my side
This shit ain't right

[Pre-Hook]

Anything she wanted I bought it
Broke my neck to make sure that this girl didn't go with out it
I can't hate the homie
Cause I am the blame
Instead of loving you I was makin it rain

[Hook]

He took my shawty
He took my girl
He took the any and every thing out my world
He took my heart from me
He took my soul
I should have known that money couldn't match love
(it ain't no match)
A yeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeah

[Verse 2]

Now what they got is different
And when it came to love I didn't take the time
(the time, the time, the time)
He got it right
And all this time I was kissing her good bye
(good bye)
And I can't call her
Even tho right now the boy is in need
But needing her won't bring her back to me
I can't breath
And I got heart aches like you wouldn't belive

[Pre-Hook]

Anything she wanted I bought it
Broke my neck to make sure that this girl didn't go with out it
I can't hate the homie
Cause I am the blame
Instead of loving you I was makin it rain

[Hook]

He took my shawty
He took my girl
He took the any and every thing out my world
He took my heart from me
He took my soul
I should have known that money couldn't match love
(it ain't no match)
Ayeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeah

[Bridge]

If you got a girl
Man hold her close
And tell her you love her dont let her go
I'm telling you I'm warning you
No matter what you got anybody could leave you

[Hook]

He took my shawty
He took my girl
He took the any and every thing out my world
He took my heart from me
He took my soul
I should have known that money couldn't match love
(money ain't no match)
A yeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeahaa ayeah ayeah ayeah
