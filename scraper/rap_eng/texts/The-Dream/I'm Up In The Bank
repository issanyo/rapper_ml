Killa (X8)

I don't buy nothin less than 20z
I don't lend nothin less findiz
You know, Prada , Gucci , Louis
You know Chanel, LouiB
You know I ain't the one the flaws but I keep you
A lot talk so but can you low a 100 grand and 50 minutes
Yeah I thought so
And while you gettin on a high pitch
Talk so you can remind me of your bro
You need to stop actin all funny
And stop thinkin' about me and think about your money

I'm up in the bank {X6}
Gettin paid
I'm up in the bank {X6}
Gettin paid

[Chorus]

What have you made on your job
Last year multiplyed by 10 and I'm spend that in the mall
See , I try to be humble but they be hatin on buy hatin on fly hatin on I
And they don't even know why ?
See what you doin looks so mean

[Chorus]
