[Intro]

Radiokilla
My publisher love when I do this
R and B gorilla
Call the radio right now
That nigga Dream done put it down again
Dream done put it down again

[Verse 1]

Every time you bring your ass around
I put it down
Cupid ain't got shit on me
Loading up my arrow
Cocking back your bow
Cupid ain't got shit on me

[Pre-Chorus 1]

She said all these niggas be popping that bullshit
But I be in it like a preacher in a pulpit
It ain't they fault cause I'm sure that they mean you well
But every time they fail
She runs right back to Mr. Yeah

[Chorus 1]

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
To Mr. Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come back to Mr. Yeah

[Verse 2]

Now come here little baby
Let me do that body like it oughta be done
And how could somebody mistreat a body
That's hotter than 100 suns?
You deserve a better man
And I got the better plan
Cupid ain't got shit on me
I'm harder than Superman
I bounce back like a rubber band
These niggas ain't got shit on me, you know it

[Pre-Chorus 2]

See all these niggas be popping that bullshit
But I be in it like a preacher in a pulpit
It ain't they fault cause I know they mean you well
And every time you fail
She runs right back to Mr. Yeah

[Chorus 2]

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Rock that body Mr. Yeah)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come back to Mr. Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
(Ask Mariah, I touch that body like yeah)
Mr. Yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Come back to Mr. Yeah


[Bridge]

Yeah, I get it, you wanted a little boyfriend
So you went and got one. But you know, like I know that
He can't love you like I do
So whenever you wanna come back, and stand beside me
I can make you what you deserve to be
(And what's that?) A woman

[Outro]

Stunting on my ella
Loving on my ella
Hugging on my ella
Rubbing on my ella
Feeling on my ella
Chilling with my ella
There's nothing you can tell her

You will always be my baby, my baby, my baby
You will always be my baby, my baby, my baby
And I know that I will always be your baby
Sweet baby, hey baby
You will always be

You can always come back
You can always come back
(Yeah, you can always come back to me)
You can always come back
You can always come back

Can we fuck now?
