[Verse 1]
Whatever them girls tell you
Don't pay them any mind
Cause there ain't no better feeling
Than when you are mine
I'm just looking for somebody that can
Drive me crazy, crazy
Hey, heartbreaker, I'm standing in your line
I'd like to see you come and try to break mine
Put it on me, baby, everytime you leave
Girl, you take all of me
Put it on me, baby, til I can't live
Without you, can't breathe without you
Put it on me, baby, want you to be my
Irreplaceable, it's never been done before
Put it on me, put it on me, love me down

[Hook]
Baby I wanna see that body work
Let me see that body work
Show me what I've been missing
Every time you kiss me, love is
What you giving
I wanna see that body work
Let me see that body work
Every time you touch me, I can
Tell you love me. Finally, now I
Can stop searching
Let me see that body work

[Verse 2]
Girl, fuck what you heard
Just do it to me right and I'm commited
And if I ain't giving you all the love
You need, we can get there
I just wanna give you what you deserve
Round the clock, on the dot
Everything I got
And I want someone to give me what I deserve
And I don't need another bitch to lie to me
Shut up and put it on me baby
Everytime you leave, I want you to take
All of me with you, put it on me baby
Til I can't live without you
Put it on me baby, want you to be my
Irreplaceable - it's never been done before
Put it on me, love me down

[Hook]
