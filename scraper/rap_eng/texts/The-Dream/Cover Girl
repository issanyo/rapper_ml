[Verse 1]
She has pictures of Marilyn
She just moved here from Maryland
I met her at JFK
She said, call her Monroe
She said, "Listen boy, I'm new in town"
And I said, "Maybe I can show you around
"Chivalry ain't dead, let me get that door"

[Pre-Chorus]
Plum lipstick, staring as she powders her face
Where you going, baby, we ain't in a race
She looks at me and says, "Babe, you never know"
I said, "Well, 'scuse me, you're fine, babe, you look OK"
She said, "That's fine if you like fine, but I need great"
And I say, "When was the last time you seen your face"
Hm

[Chorus]
She said, "No one remembers the sweet girls
"All those girls fall into the sea of mediocrity
"No one remembers the nice girls
"But they're gonna remember me"
As we stand in the autumn air, I swear
Your beauty will turn one day and leave
Your beauty will turn one day, like leaves

[Verse 2]
She has clippings of Diana Ross
How she walk in them in heels and don't fall, I don't know
Flawless and wearing such a wonderful glow
She wore a white gown for no reason
But only when white is in season
How she keep up with all of this, man, I don't know

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Hey babe, I don't wanna cramp your style
"But you been here all night and I ain't seen one smile"
And somehow, she took that as add more gloss
What the-- mhm
Everybody got somebody and they hittin' the floor
She too cute to move and too pretty to know
Girl, when was the last time you shook your-- hm

[Chorus]
She said, "No one remembers the fun girls
"All those girls fall into the sea of mediocrity
"No one remembers the cool girls
"But they're gonna remember me"
As we stand in the autumn air, I swear
Your beauty will turn one day and leave
Your beauty will turn one day, like leaves

[Bridge]
No one remembers the sweet girls
All those girls fall into the sea of mediocrity
No one remembers the nice girls
She said, "But they're gonna remember me"

[Outro]
No one remembers the cool girls
All those girls falling into the sea of mediocrity
No one remembers the fun girls
They're going to remember me
That's what she said
As we stand in the autumn air, I swear
Your beauty will turn one day and leave
Your beauty will turn one day, like leaves
Your beauty will turn one day, like leaves
