Wo... Your love's like those trains
Those trains
My heart's like that cargo
That just happen' to be attached
Hey!
My addiction to that train
Am i insane?
To think something differnt's coming 'cross that track

Sometimes i feel so lost
But they say love is blind
Sometimes i need you here to
To help me face my fears
Standing in this fire
Seduced by the flames
Why can't you be my joy
And also be my pain

Some nights i wish i didn't love ya
Some days i wish i didn't care
Sometimes i just hold on
Can't stand the idea
Of sleeping by myself

Well
Your love's like those trains
Those trains
My heart's like that cargo that just happen' to be attached
Hey!!
My addiction to those trains
Am i insane?
Think something differnt's coming down that track
Nothing's coming cross those tracks

Because of you i am better and i'm worse
Sometimes the reality of that can really hurt
(even more)
Because of you i take the sweet with a grain of salt
(grain of salt)
'cause of you i feel everything and nothing at all

Some nights i wish i didn't love ya
Some days i wish i didn't care
Sometimes i just hold on
Can't stand the idea
Of sleeping by myself

Some nights i wish i didn't love ya
Some days i wish i didn't care
Sometimes i just hold on
Can't stand the idea
Of sleeping by myself

My addiction to that train
Am i insane?
To think somethin' different's coming down that track
Nothing's coming cross those tracks
Yeah
Am i insane to think something different's coming cross that track
Nothing's coming cross those tracks

Some nights i wish i didn't love ya
Some days i wish i didn't care
Sometimes i just hold on
Can't stand the idea
Of sleeping by myself

Some nights i wish i didn't love ya
Some days i wish i didn't care
Sometimes i just hold on
Can't stand the idea
Of sleeping by myself
