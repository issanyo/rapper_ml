[AD LIB] - The Dream
Lil' mama let's go!

[Intro] - DJ Drama
I gotta be honest...the one I'm with now
She's so bad, when we go there it get's better everytime
I mean when you look at her it's like gaddamn! Baby, just let your hair down so I can pull on it...You know the voice

[Verse 1]
Going in straight to the floor with it
Gonna do like a stripper on the pole with it
Gone roll to the left, gone roll to the right
Now back it up, like a truck
That’s it baby, on your toes with it
Go and pop that pussy like I’m all in it
Been at work all day, swinging my way
Get this drink in your cup, shawty get fucked up

[Hook 1: The-Dream]
And let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Shots and champagne
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
I got you babe

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Go and make me want to spend some money on it
Too sweet, shawty put some honey on it
Girl what’s under there, what’s under thar
You shaking that gummy bear on my gummy worm
Go and back it up like a Cadillac
You can cause a wreck, I run it to the back of that
You want me to take it, and let you have it back
You can’t leave, girl I ain’t having that
I make you say ooh
Girl if you want to move I can show you what to do
So don’t be standing over there acting all funny
Go and get rid of that scrunchy baby

[Hook 2: T-Pain]
And let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
For The-Dream and T-Pain
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
I got you babe

[Verse 3: Vantrease]
Go ahead shawty, shake that ladidadi
Two shots, come and deep throat it for me
Three shots, Imma fuck around and walk up on it
Could drop a band on you shawty
Head down, fuck around and throw a fitted on it
Shawty dance like a stripper, she’ll drop it on it
And all this money in the air got your name on it
Cause I got you babe, oooh
Girl, tonight I need something for me to pull on
So relax baby and let your hair down

[Hook 2: T-Pain]
And let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
For The-Dream and T-Pain
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
Let your hair down, let your hair down
I got you babe
