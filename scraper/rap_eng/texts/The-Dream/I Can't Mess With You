[Chorus]
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)

[Verse 1]
Baby yesterday would seem real cool but lately you treat me so cruel
Sleepin next to you feels new
It ain't nothin like it used to
Still if I'm not next to you
I need some tweekin' I'm out of tune
But somethin' bout that thang you do
It could only come from you

[Bridge]
You like my body I want your last name why can't we make it work
And when you leave me right when you see me, get on each others nerves

[Chorus]
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)

[Verse 2]
Something the other day I thought of you made me feel like you poisoned my food it just got to be
Some voodoo why can't I get approved by you what the hell am I supposed to do when all my self
Directed by you I'm effected by all your cause and cures I need to get away from you

[Bridge]
You like my body I want your last name why can't we make it work
And when you leave me right when you see me, get on each others nerves

[Chorus]
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)

[Verse 3: The-Dream]
I didn't know how so I tried to buy your love
I should've been up at the crib but I was up in the club
My niggas told me "Dream, take it home"
But I was like "Give me another shot of Hennessy, dog"
Travelin' high speeds then we crashed, mane
And I, was so blind in the fast lane
And you were a better woman than I was a man
Can you forgive the blueprint it wasn't in my plan
And all you ever asked was to understand
But I had my head too far up up in my ass
Any nigga can love a girl's body but it took man to love your mind I heard you doin' fine
I see you in magazines every other page
I wish I wasn't talkin' to you from this cage
But I'm screamin' "Go, girl" from the jail cell
And Niv' I know I did you wrong but I meant well

[Chorus]
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)
I can't mess with you 'cause I'm still in love with you (Ohhh)
