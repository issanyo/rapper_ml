[Intro]
Every time I think about you, I just
Wanna take this shit back from the top
Ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Hey, baby, I feel like I owe you
Too much to text
Girl, I wanna show you regrets
Right now, I wanna hold you
Feel like I owe you
I feel like I owe you
Girl I feel like-

[Verse 1]
Baby, know I miss your lovin'
Baby, know I miss your touch, ooh
Baby, know I miss that cloud nine
Baby, I wish we had more time
Baby, I know you still got me
Baby, yes, [?] kill, bitch, got me
Baby, hope you ain't forgot me
Baby, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Hey, baby, I feel like I owe you
And it's too much to text
Girl, I need to show you that I still have regrets
I wish I could hold you
Feel like I owe you
Girl, I feel like I owe you
Girl, I feel like-

[Verse 2]
Baby, you know that I fucked up
Baby, took away that good love
Baby, I ain't seen the sunshine

[Bridge]
I know I gave your love to someone else
And I know, and I know, that I was so selfish
I know you will never forgive me
I know you don't wanna be near me
I know, hope you turn this up so you can hear me out, hear me out, ohh

[Verse 3]
Baby, you know that I love you
Baby, do anything for you
Baby, I can't get that time back
Baby, you were right about that
Baby, you said that I miss you
Baby, said I wouldn't forget you
Baby, yeah, I wish I was near you
[?]

[Chorus]
Hey, baby, I feel like I owe you
And it's too much to text
Girl, I need to show you that I still have regrets
I wish I could hold you (I wish, I wish)
Feel like I owe you (I feel like I owe you)
Girl, I feel like I owe you (I'm in love)
Girl, I feel like-

[Outro]

Owe you, I owe you
