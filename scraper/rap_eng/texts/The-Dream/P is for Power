[Intro:]
P is for Power
The U is for Used to
Cause my P better than that P that you used to

Uh huh

[Verse 1: Naomi]
Ain't got no money
Ain't got no car
Ain't got no jewels
Boy I'm a star
Ain't get no fare time
It's past your bedtime
Stay at you mama house
(Mm Mm, Hmm?)

[Sarah]
Ain't got no jet
You can get
Ain't got no juice
Can't get no fruit
You ain't paid
You can't get laid
You want this baby?
Step Off!

[Chorus:]
You ain't getting no P
(Nope, Nope)
You ain't getting no P
(Nope, Nope)
You ain't getting no P-E!
You ain't getting no P
(Nope)

[Verse 2: Naomi]
Ain't got no house
Ain't got no clothes
Nothing to fold, my bank account bigger than yours
You ain't no papi
You a nadie
I'm together
You sloppy

[Sarah]
You just a wanksta
You just a lame
You ain't no Jay-Z (New York!)
You ain't no Wayne
You think you hot
But you not
You want a shot?
Step off!

[Chorus]

[Hook: Binkie]
Ladies

The Y is for "Yes", vanilla
If you wanna try boy you gotta buy

Oh I won't just fall into your arms oh Oh no
And I don't know why you seem so alarmed oh no
Damn I kinda feel for you
Hold up I gotta deal for you
Give me yours and I'll give mine

If you wanna love the P lemme see them dolla signs, dolla signs
(Let me see them dolla signs)
Let me see them dolla signs
(Let me see them dolla signs)
