Sat up in the dark for so long
Just living my life on my own
Then right up outta the blue, bumped into you
I was so amused by your smile boo

Wantin' you to call my phone
So me and you can talk just a little mo'
I didn't know what to do, I was feelin' you
Hopin' you be cool by hangin' out too

I don't know what happened, got people steady askin'
How you go to sleep mad one day the next wake up so happy
Love works like magic and a so true my mind came graspin'
I'm just glad that I got you in my life

I think about us
(All day)
Dream about ya
(Always)
Love ain't always
(Complicated)

I think about us
(All day)
Dream about ya
(Always)
Love ain't always
(Complicated)

If I'm lovin' it don't take long
People speculatin' that it won't last long
But that just can't be true 'cuz I be lovin' you
Like you never knew that I could do

Never let go, gotta hold on
'Cuz you don't made me and you a happy home
And I'll give all me to you
I'll do whatever you ask me to 'cuz boy you're my

Biggest blessing, they can keep on askin'
How I go to sleep mad one day the next wake up so happy
Well love works like magic and it's so true my mind came graspin'
I'm so glad that you made me your wife

I think about us
(All day)
Dream about ya
(Always)
Love ain't always
(Complicated)

Boy, you make me feel so beautiful
And I ain't never gonna let you go
People say this ain't how it's supposed to go
But I refuse to believe 'cuz it happened to me

One day you're standing in the middle of the world
And you don't where you goin'
All of a sudden your whole life change
Then life finally gives you somethin' back
It's been a mean world without ya
Boy, I love ya, I love ya

I think about us
(All day)

Dream about ya

Love ain't always
(Complicated)
(And I ain't never gonna let you go)
