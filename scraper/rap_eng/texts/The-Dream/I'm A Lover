[Verse 1]
Once I get you boy
You ain't gon' wanna leave
Once I kiss you boy
You gon' wanna kiss me
Once I touch you boy
You gon' wanna touch me back
I'ma take you boy, then I'ma break ya boy
What ya think about that

[Pre-Hook]
See I'm not just a pretty little face
And a pretty little waistline
Not just another little girl
Boy, I know how to satisfy

[Hook]
Boy I'm a lover
Yes indeed I'm, indeed I'm, indeed...
I'm a lover
Oh yes indeed I'm, indeed I'm...
I'm a lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I'm a lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I'm a lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover

[Verse 2]
I'ma love you boy
I'ma fulfil ya fantasy
I'ma show you boy
There's no man next to me
Up, down, there ya go
Right, left, fast, slow
I'm a professional love mechanism
I think the neighbors hear ya

[Pre-Hook]
See I'm not just a pretty little face
And a pretty little waistline
And I'm not your average girl
I know how to satisfy

[Hook]
Boy I'm a lover
Yes indeed I'm, indeed I'm, indeed...
I'm a lover
Oh yes indeed I'm, indeed I'm...
I'm a lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I'm a lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover
I'm a lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover, lover

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah baby...
Yeah, yeah, don't know what I'll do for you...
I'll make every fantasy ya got come true
Red light, stop, do what I do
Blue light, got something special for you
I'm the girl of your dreams
Hold on to me
