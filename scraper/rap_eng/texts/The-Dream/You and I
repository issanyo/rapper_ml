[Intro]
It just wasn't our time
Shawty, it just wasn't our time
It just wasn't our time

[Verse 1]
You and I, angel eyes
Girl, you deserve anything your pretty heart desires
See, I'm still willing to give you what you need, oh yeah
All you gotta do is tell me, baby, and I'll be right there
To search and destroy any thought of you
Thinkin' I ain't thinkin' 'bout ya

[Chorus 1]
You and I will always be a thing
No matter who we're seeing
No matter who I bring, yeah
Oh baby, you and I will always be a thing
No matter who we're seeing
No matter who I bring, yeah
Oh baby

[Verse 2]
I was just sittin' in my car the other day
Coulda swore I saw your pretty face ride by
It engulfed me with visions when you were with me
It took years to replace what you were to me
And I still got love for you, baby
And even though we owe each other nothing
Not a call, not a text, it don't matter who's next
You were one of my best, baby

[Chorus 2]
You and I will always be a thing
No matter who we're seeing
No matter who I bring, yeah
Oh baby, you and I will always be a thing
No matter who we're seeing
No matter who I bring, yeah
You and I will always be a thing
No matter who we're bringing
No matter who we're seeing
You and I will always be a thing
No matter who we're seeing
No matter who I bring, yeah

[Outro]
We don't need no bridge for this song, baby
Just let it go, let it go, let it go, let it go
We don't need no bridge for this song, baby
Let it go, just let it go, just let it go
We don't need no bridge for this song
Baby, let it go, let it go, baby, let it go
We don't need no bridge for this song
Just let it go, let it go, just let it go
You and I
