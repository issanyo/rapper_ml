Yeeaah, Right [x5]

[Chorus:]
I dont know why (I dont know why)
She keeps on passin' me by
Maybe her eye is on just some other guy
And I'll forever be that fella on the side
She passes me by

[Verse:]
As I hopped off the train this shawty caught my eye
I asked her for her name she gave me no reply
She left me standing there with arrows in my heart
But yet and still I'm wanting her
And later on that week while driving in my car
I coulda sworn I saw that shawty walking down the road
I thought she passed at me while I was staring from afar
Or is just my young mind wishing

[Chorus:]
I dont know why (I dont know why)
She keeps on passin' me by
Maybe her eye is on just some other guy
And I'll forever be that fella on the side
She passes me by

[Hook:]
Come back come back come back come back
Come back
(Come back come back come back come back)
I said come back baby
(Come back come back come back come back) [x2]
I want you here by me (Come back come back come back come back) [x3]

[Verse:]
It gets so confusing this game
I met alot of girls but never felt this way
I get strange pleasure though from going through this pain
And like a ghost I'm haunting her
I often fantasize about walking hand in hand
But I don't know her name or if she's got a man
And the only thing that gives me hope to stay
Is maybe one day she'll notice me

[Chorus:]
I dont know why (I dont know why)
She keeps on passin' me by, (She keeps on passin' me by,)
Maybe her eye is on just some other guy
And I'll forever be that fella on the side, (but I dont wana be on the side)

(Come back come back come back come back)
Why won't you come back (Come back come back come back come back)
I know you want to (Come back come back come back come back)
(Come back come back come back come back)
