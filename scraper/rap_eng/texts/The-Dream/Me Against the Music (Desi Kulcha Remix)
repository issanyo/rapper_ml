[Intro: Britney Spears]
All my people, all my people
Grab a partner take it down
Britney?
Are you ready?
Uh-huh
It's me against the music
It's just me
And me
All my...
Yeah
Come on
Let's go!
It's me against the music

[Verse 1: Britney Spears & Madonna]
And no one cares
It's whippin' my hair, it's pullin' my waist
To hell with stares
The sweat is drippin' all over my face
And no one's there
I'm the only one dancin' up in this place
Tonight I'm here
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta keep it that bass

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I'm up against the speaker, tryna take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone (I wanna get in the zone)
I wanna get in the zone (I wanna get in the zone)
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryna hit it chic-a-tah
In a minute, I'mma take you on (I'mma take you on)
I'mma take you on (I'mma take you on)
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Madonna, Both]
All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin' more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people 'round and 'round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

[Post-Chorus: Britney Spears & Madonna, Both]
How would you like a friendly competition?
Let's take on the song
Let's take on the song, let's take on the song
It's you and me baby, we're the music
Time to party all night long
All night long, all night long
(Yeah, let's go)

[Verse 2: Britney Spears & Madonna]
We're almost there
I'm feelin' it bad and I can't explain
My soul is bare
My hips are movin' at a rapid pace
Can you feel it burn?
From the tip of my toes, runnin' through my veins
And now it's your turn
Let me see what you got, don't hesitate

[Pre-Chorus: Britney Spears]
I'm up against the speaker, tryna take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in the zone (I wanna get in the zone)
I wanna get in the zone (I wanna get in the zone)
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryna hit it chic-a-tah
In a minute, I'mma take you on
I'mma take you on
Hey, hey, hey

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Madonna, Both]
All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin' more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people 'round and 'round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

[Hook: Britney Spears & Madonna]
Get on the floor, baby, lose control (Yeah)
Just work your body (uh-huh) and let it go (Let it go)
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney, we can dance all night long

[Bridge: Madonna]
Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Come over here, I got something to show ya
Sexy lady, I'd rather see you bare your soul
If you think you're so hot, better show me what you got

[Chorus 2: Madonna]
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
Come on Britney, lose control, watch you take, take it down

[Hook: Britney Spears & Madonna]
Get on the floor, baby, lose control
Just work your body and let it go
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
Hey Britney, we can dance all night long

[Chorus: Britney Spears & Madonna, Both]
All my people on the floor
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people wantin' more
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya
All my people 'round and 'round
Let me see you dance
Let me see ya
All my people in the crowd
Let me see you dance
I wanna see ya

[Bridge: Madonna]
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
Come on Britney, take it down, make the music dance
All my people 'round and 'round, party all night long
Come on Britney, lose control, watch you take it down

[Outro: Britney Spears & Madonna]
It's me against the music
It's me against the music
It's just me, and me
All my people in the crowd, grab a parter, take i down
All my people, all my people
Grab a parter, take it down
