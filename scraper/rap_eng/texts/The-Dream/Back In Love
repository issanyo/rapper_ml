[Verse 1]
I miss that body in the hallway
I used to meet that body in the foyer
If you were right here, we'd have to skip the foreplay
It's been some time
Girl, it feels like been like we've been on consignment
Had to turn them lights off so we could find it
Now you know how love is all about the timing and colorblind
I was mad at you, you was mad at me
C'est la vie, arrivederci
Still, all I loved was you
Still, I had no clue that you would leave
But I'm glad we're back to unbreak things and that's overdue

[Chorus]
Back in love, back in love, back in love with you
And now we're making love, making love like we used to do
I took some time out, I took some time off
Just to think things through
Oh, now I'm back in love, back in love
Back in love with you

[Verse 2]
I'ma lay right here in you all day
And I'ma make sure that you lean sideways
And I'ma bury all of those bad times we used to have, ooh
And my niggas weren't with it
And your friends wasn't fuckin' with it, either
Ask how could I leave ya
"Boy, you know you need her," I just need to please her
Let me roll my sleeves up
Tell them bitches, "Ease up," because I'm

[Chorus]
Back in love, back in love, back in love with you
And now we're making love, making love like we used to do
I took some time out, I took some time off
Just to think things through
But now I'm back in love, back in love, back in love with you
Ooh baby, yeah

[Bridge]
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Sometimes things don't go how they should
But if it's meant, they'll come back
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
Every day ain't the same
You'll have to dream love like that
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
You just need that freakin' for a weekend
Then we'll step back like that
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
You just need that freakin' for a weekend, baby
Then we're right back

[Chorus]
Back in love, back in love, back in love with you
And now we're making love, making love like we used to do
I took some time out, I took some time off
Just to think things through
Oh, now I'm back in love, back in love, back in love with you

[Outro]
Ooh baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh baby, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Ooh baby, ooh baby, yeah
Back in love, back in love
