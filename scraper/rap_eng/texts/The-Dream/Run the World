[Intro]
Uh, we got it locked, but they know (Hey)
And what whenever we around it goes down like Draino (Hey, hey)
Uh, and it's nothing to spend these pesos (Okay, yeah)
And you will never see us with a fake, no (Now put it in my album for me)
Uh, getting colder than them low lows
Rollies on our arms worth a thousand and the charm
Ain't nothing greater
Hanging out the window, straight busting at you love haters (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
Bonnie, Clyde (Yeah)
No other girl will ever ride like I ride
That's why you need me on your passenger side
Let me help you get that paper
Hanging out the window busting at them love haters (Yeah)
Me and you (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'm the closest you'll ever be to truth (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
There's never a question of what I'll do, uh-huh, for you
With me, you'll never lose, so (That's right)

[Chorus]
Call on your girl that can hold you right
I'll be your protector, I'll never forget ya
You need somebody that can hold you tight (That's right)
I'll be your armor, keep you out of harm, boy (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
If things get too hot out in the cold with ya (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Froze, froze with ya
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Oh, oh, run the world
Oh, oh, our love could run the world
Oh, oh, run the world
Oh, oh, our love could run the world
Hanging out the window, straight busting at you love haters

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'll be your anything, everything
Oh, oh, rock 'n roll with ya
If things get too hot out in the cold with ya
Oh, oh, froze, froze with ya
Oh, oh, me and you together, our love could run the world
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it

[Verse 2]
Make it through any weather, baby (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Don't pay them any attention, it'll just drive you crazy
All that really matters is our love for one another
And all we'll ever have is each other (Yeah)
Let a chick try to come around
We both know she'll never be down
She'll never have your back, wouldn't know how to act (Sure)
I can't say it no better than that (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Call on your girl that can hold you right (Okay)
I'll be your protector, I'll never forget ya (Yeah)
You need somebody that can hold you tight (Yeah)
I'll be your armor, keep you out of harm, boy (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I'll be your anything, everything
Rock 'n roll with ya (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
If things get too hot out in the cold with ya (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Froze, froze with ya (Did it again)
Me and you together, our love could run the world
Oh, oh, run the world
Oh, oh, our love could run the world (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, run the world (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, oh, our love could run the world

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, I'll be your anything, everything
Oh, oh, rock 'n roll with ya
If things get too hot out in the cold with ya
Oh, oh, froze, froze with ya
Oh, oh, me and you together, our love could run the world
Hanging out the window, straight busting at you love haters
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Our love could run the world

[Bridge]
Don't you see there's no love like you and me?
Can't you see, baby, there's nobody more powerful than we?
Can't you see that I'm the only thing you'll ever need?
Can't you see that? (Yeah) Can't you see that?
I love you, baby

[Outro]
Our love could run the world
Oh, oh, run the world
Oh, oh, our love could run the world
Oh, oh, run the world
Hanging out the window, straight busting at you love haters
Oh, oh, our love could run the world
I'll be your anything, everything
Oh, oh, rock 'n roll with ya
If things get too hot out in the cold with ya
Oh, oh, froze, froze with ya
Run the world
Oh, oh, our love could run the world
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run, run, run, run it
Run the world
Our love could run the world
