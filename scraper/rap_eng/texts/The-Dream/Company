[Hook]
I don't need the lovin'
So don't make this something, see
I'm nothing like a girlfriend
I'm not like someone I'm supposed to be
And I just want some company, company
I just need some company
I just need some company
I just need some company

[Verse 1]
'Panion, shout-out to my road dawg
I'm straight up
With this one boy I know of
I call 'em
When I start feeling alone
I want it and sometimes see I don't

[Pre-Hook]
I don't need no problems wit nobody
And I know how to get there, don't follow me
I just need a moment, fuck and leave
You can say you had it all
No strings

[Hook]
I don't need the lovin'
So don't make this something, see
I'm nothing like a girlfriend
I'm not like someone I'm supposed to be
And I just want some company, company
I just need some company
I just need some company
I just need some company

[Verse 2]
Companions
But we keep it even lower
I never, ever been the type to just show up
And you can't ever be the type-a-guy to just show up
And treat this like a meet and greet
And then we go up

[Pre-Hook]
I don't need no problems wit nobody
And I know how to get there, don't follow me
I just need a moment, fuck and leave
You can say you had it all
No strings

[Bridge]
Had it all
You can say you had it
You can say you had it all
You can say you had it
You can say you had it all
You can say you had it

Aww bae
You're just my little side thing
Just a little sweet fling, baby
You don't have to buy things
I just want the high, supply me

[Hook]
I don't need the lovin'
So don't make this something, see
I'm nothing like a girlfriend
I'm not like someone I'm supposed to be
And I just want some company, company
I just need some company
I just need some company
I just need some company

[Outro]
Da, da, da, I just need
I just need some company, company
I just need some company
