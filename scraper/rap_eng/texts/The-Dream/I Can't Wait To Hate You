[Verse 1]
I jump up out my bed, grab my clothes
And I, throw on my coat out the door
And I'm, today I'm gonna get over you (you, you, you)
Yeah, then I hop in the car
Push the button on the automatic start
Right on the seat I see a scarf I gave to you
Oh, memories start coming back
No room for reverse I can't back back
I'm sittin' in the car but I can't back back
And so, I'm slumped over the wheel of the car
And all I can think of is a broken heart
And all I can think of is why were apart

[Bridge]
We went round for round
Til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
I can't wait to hate you
All the things you put me through
I wanna move on
I can't wait to hate you
All the days you left my heart all alone
I can't wait to hate you
This is all crazy
And I can't come to grips with the fact that you're gone
I can't wait to hate you
Ooooo Oh

[Verse 2]
Jump up out my bed, grab my clothes
And I, throw on my coat out the door
And I'm, today I'm gonna get over you (you, you, you)
Yeah, then I hop in the car
Press the button on the automatic start
Right on the seat I see a scarf I gave to you
Oh, memories start coming back
No room for reverse I can't back back
I'm sittin' in the car but I can't back back
And so, I'm slumped over the wheel of the car
And all I can think of is a broken heart
And all I can think of is why were apart

[Bridge]
We went round for round
Til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye

[Chorus]
I can't wait to hate you
Oh, the things you put me through
I wanna move on
I can't wait to hate you
Oh, the days you left my heart all alone
I can't wait to hate you
This is all crazy and I can't come to grips with the fact that you're gone
I can't wait to hate you
Ooooo Oh
