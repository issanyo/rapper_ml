[Intro]
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am

[Verse 1]
He been gone since 3:30
Been coming home lately at 3:30
I'm super cool, I've been a fool
But now I'm hot and baby, you gon' get it
Now I ain't tripping, I ain't twisted
I ain't demented, well, just a lil' bit
I'm kickin' asses, I'm taking names
I'm on flame, don't come home, babe

[Hook]
I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n

[Verse 2]
I'm still waiting, come through the door
I'm killing time, you know, bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire
And what I'm burning is your attire
I'm getting restless, I'm getting tested
And I can't believe he's always out every night and never checks in
Is he cheating? Man, I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw

[Hook]
I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n

[Breakdown]
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am

[Hook]
I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n
I'm breaking dishes up in here, all night
I ain't gon' stop until I see police lights
I'mma fight a man tonight, I'mma fight a man tonight
I'mma fight a man, a man, a m-a-n

[Outro]
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
I don't know who you think I am
