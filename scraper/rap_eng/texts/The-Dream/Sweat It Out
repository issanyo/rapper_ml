We’re trading affection as I mess up her bang

Didn’t mean to mess up a good thing (ehh)
But I needed you babe (ehh)

Purse, Skirt, Shirt, I’m glad that you took it off
Necklace, white tee, my nikes, I couldn’t wait to take it off

But you know I couldn’t stop it

That I would get your shit fixed

(Chorus)

(Verse 3)
The sweat is racin’ down your spine
I promise its gon’ be alright

And even though I got it all tangled
