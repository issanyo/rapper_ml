No phones tonight
Paralyzed on you
Don’t apologize
When tomorrow falls through

Oh don’t even look my way
Stay, stay
Don’t even talk my way
Stay, stay

Hook
I’m way too young to die (over you, over you)
I’m way too young to cry (over you, over you)
I’m way too dope for lies (over you, over you) Too fly to stand in line (over you, over you)

I’m way too young to die (over you, over you)
I’m way too young to cry (over you, over you)
I’m way too dope for lies (over you, over you) Too fly to stand in line (over you, over you)

First
First
I don’t play second place
That love you say you got for me
Better fix the race
Cause I’ll hang us off a balcony
Fix your face
Just fix your face

Pre-
Oh don’t even look my way
When you see me stay, stay
Oh don’t even talk my way
Stay

Hook x2
I’m way too young to die (over you, over you)
I’m way too young to cry (over you, over you)
I’m way too dope for lies (over you, over you) Too fly to stand in line (over you, over you)

First
First
I don’t play second place
