[Verse 1]
Why don't they hate you?
Why do they hate me?
Why are their blogs set up to debate, but only forsake me
How am I doing, and why do you care?
When my failures come with smiles
When I win, I write, you just compare
So why, must I try to own your love
When I'm better than what I've been
But that's not good enough
Why, you can't hear my decency
Instead of me singing at friends
I'm talking over enemies
The world is so...

[Chorus]
Loud
Loud, loud
It's so loud
Loud, loud
It's like hearing pins drop in the crowd
They won't stop until they God damn tear you down
Man, the world is so loud
Loud, loud, it's so loud
Loud, loud
I tried to drown them all out in my sound
But they won't stop, stop until they tear you down
Until they tear me down
(Take me as I am)
Until they tear me down
(As I am)

[Verse 2]
They saw my destruction
That's why I'm so reluctant
Want me to pass the ball
But you're not on my team
You wanna cast a stone
We're so ready to fight
Got the nerve to ask, how did I sleep?
I heard you all through the night
Somebody tell me why, I know it's not just me
Over a billion voices
Don't think, just speak
You hate me when I'm up
You love me when I'm down
I'm so confused by the world
Hey, the world is so...

[Chorus]
Loud
Loud, loud
It's so loud
Loud, loud
It's like hearing pins drop in the crowd
They won't stop until they God damn tear you down
And the world is so loud
Loud, loud, it's so loud
Loud, loud
I tried to drown them all out in my sound
But they won't stop, stop until they tear you down
Until they tear me down
(Take me as I am)
Until they tear me down
(Until they tear me down, until they tear me down, until they tear me down, until they tear me down)
(As I am)

[Bridge]
Long ago, I swear
I couldn't hear a sound
I couldn't hear a sound
As a little girl
With a little fortune
Hoping this is true
So tear me down
(oh, the world is so loud)

[Chorus]
Loud
Loud, loud
It's so loud
Loud, loud
It's like hearing pins drop in the crowd
They won't stop until they God damn tear you down
And the world is so loud
Loud, loud, it's so loud
Loud, loud
I tried to drown them all out in my sound
But they won't stop, stop until they tear you down
(Until they tear you down)
Until they tear you down
(Take me as I am, as I am)
Take me as I am
(As I am)
The world is so loud
