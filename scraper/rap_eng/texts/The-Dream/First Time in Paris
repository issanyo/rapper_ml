[Verse 1]
It's sad but true
I know your loving's mine to lose
And I'm afraid to make you choose
I inherited a heart that was black and blue
It's me and you

[Hook]
It's our first time in Paris
And I know you been here a million times, why you wanna make me jealous
Even though you're telling me, baby
This ain't the same
I can't tell
From the arguing and the fighting every day
It feels like you're missing someone
I know I said the past didn't matter
But when you bring up the past, babe
I just get madder
You try to refrain
But in the end, you just compare us
I try to brush it off, but underneath it all, I'm embarrassed
Embarrassed

[Bridge]
Cause I'll never have your love
And we'll never have that love
I'm just here 'til you make up
I'm just here 'til we break up

[Verse 1]
It's sad but true
I know your loving's mine to lose
And I'm afraid to make you choose
I inherited a heart that was black and blue
That's me and you

[Hook]
It's our first time in Paris
And I know you been here a million times, why you wanna make me jealous
Even though you're telling me, baby
This ain't the same
I can't tell
From the arguing and the fighting every day
It feels like you're missing someone
I know I said the past didn't matter
But when you bring up the past, babe
I just get madder
You try to refrain
But in the end, you just compare us
I try to brush it off, but underneath it all, I'm embarrassed
It's our first time in Paris

[Bridge]
Cause I'll never have your love
And we'll never have that love
I'm just here 'til you make up
I'm just here 'til we break up, 'til we break up
