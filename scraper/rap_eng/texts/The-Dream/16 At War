[Verse 1]
Ain't no daddy's where I'm from
It's just mad mothers
And eyes that still seem
They can't look past color
Why am I disrespected by
Someone I should call brother?
And why girls feel unpretty
And constantly hate each other?
Bad air in my lungs
Man I can't breathe
My eyes burnin' from all the dirt and the debris
And it's third degree
Emotionless on the scene
It's like a disease
The way y'all killin' me

[Hook]
I'm 16 and I shouldn't have to feel like this
I'm 16, every young boy out here wanna kiss
I'm 16, and me and my mama goin' through it
16 on the block
16 on the block
16, at war, 16, at war, 16, at war
16, at war, 16, at war, 16, at war
16 on the block
16 on the block

[Verse 2]
Around here cool is another word for fool
If he smoke then she smoke
I gotta smoke too
Now what would I do if I didn't have a clue?
I'm 16 Y.O
Asking God oh Why, OH
If my clothes ain't tight
Then he ain't gone like me
Eyes on the prize
So the next girl dress just like me
I'm so full of promise
But why promise if I'm gonna just be rewarded
By bad actions
To him I'm just a transaction

[Hook]
I'm 16 and I shouldn't have to feel like this
I'm 16, every young boy out here wanna kiss
I'm 16, and me and my mama goin' through it
16 on the block
16 on the block
16, at war, 16, at war, 16, at war
16, at war, 16, at war, 16, at war
16 on the block
16 on the block

[Bridge]
I want you to love my mind
My smile, my style
I want you to know the best of me
I want to belong without being treated
Like property
Why does this seem like a fantasy?

[Hook]
I'm 16 and I shouldn't have to feel like this
I'm 16, every young boy out here wanna kiss
I'm 16, and me and my mama goin' through it
16 on the block
16 on the block
16, at war, 16, at war, 16, at war
16, at war, 16, at war, 16, at war
16 on the block
16 on the block
