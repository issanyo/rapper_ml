[Hook : The Dream]
Y'all know me cause all I do is ride around in Bentley coupe
Got no need, she got me buyin her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop
All-all-all-all-all-all we do is shop until we drop , right there in the floor
(x2)

[Lavaa Man- talking over Hook]
Ugh

Chea

Straight freestyling on these nigga man
Yeah

[Verse 1 : Lavaa Man]
Going hard in the mall
Til we hit rock bottom
Then we get drunk
Pass that ciroc bottle
Then we get high
Pass that loudingten
She put her lips on Mary
Saying she ain't lesbian
But she a got damn lie
She put her hands in her pants
She's just another freak of mine
Little little freak
We do it freak nasty
I have that pussy running
Like it seen tazzy
Dick game crack
Put it in a baggy
Am I on E
Is what she ask me
Ha
And bitch I might be on one
But if we talking weed
Then I'm on a ton
It's Bullets bitch
Get shot but my love gun
I make that body scream
Every time we have fun
We just left the mall
We threw it in the bag it
Man I killed this shit
Throw it it in the casket
Bullets
