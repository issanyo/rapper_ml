[Verse 1]
I belong to you and I'm not confused
I don't care where you been
And I don't want to know where you went
Girl I need your heart, I'm right here
And I'll try my best not to bring you to tears
If your eyes could only see what I see
Girl you're the best part of me

[Chorus]
Girl I'll do whatever it takes
Say whatever you want me to say
Girl I'll go wherever you want to go
Just teach me the way
And I'll love you for forever and a day
Day, day, day, day, day
Forever and a day, day, day
Girl you're the best part of me

[Verse 2]
Every breath is a breath for you
You have no idea what you do to me
My love was locked away
But now it's right here as where I want to be
My heart's standing still
And it'll only beat when you're near
You may never see what I see
But you're the best part of me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I need your love
I want to be the man that you deserve
Girl let me in, this is our song I'm singing

[Chorus]
