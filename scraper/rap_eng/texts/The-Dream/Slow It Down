[Intro: The Dream]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ok yohoh yohoh yohoh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yohoh yohoh yohoh ahoo
I know they ain't gon' play this on top 40 radio ahoo
But the white girls still gon' ride it like a rodeo ahoo
And I'mma stay riding this beat like a rodeo ahoo
And keep throwing money til a shawty gon' touch
Her toes ahoo
I'mma keep it real with you baby you bad ahoo
Kinda like Michael Jackson, Jacko you're bad ahoo
If you was my girl and you left me I be sad ahoo
Enough of that, let me see that ass oh

[Pre-Hook: The Dream]
I'm here to see that thing pop
I'm here to see that thing rock
I'm here to see you pick it up and let it drop
She backing it up on me, DJ you know you wrong
Enough with the motherfucking dance songs

[Hook: The Dream]
You gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
So she can take her time and work it on me, mane
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
Whisper in her ear while she on me, mane
You gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
Just swing it left, swing it right
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
Oh That's what she likes
DJ you got to slow it ahoo

[Verse 1: The Dream]
Now she rolling that and whipping her hair ahoo
Slow motion with it while everyone stares ahoo
You can see her ass from the side of her like
Back and forth, forth and back
Show me where they do this at ahoo
Always with you baby I'll never sell out ahoo
Them other niggas had to do a dance record
Or the label wouldn't put em out ahoo
I'll never put a million records before you ahoo
Just keep on doing that thing, you do oh

[Pre-Hook: The Dream]
I'm here to see that thing pop
I'm here to see that thing rock
I'm here to see you pick it up and let it drop
She backing it up on me, DJ you know you wrong
Enough with the motherfucking dance songs

[Chorus: The Dream]
You gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
So she can take her time and work it on me, mane
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
Whisper in her ear while she on me, mane
You gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
Just swing it left, swing it right
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
Oh That's what she likes
DJ you got to slow it

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Everybody know slow money
Way better than no money
Except for those who don't know shit
Don't know women and don't know money
It starts out I'm so cool
We hanging out and I'm so funny
All of a sudden I'm Winnie the Pooh
And I'm all up in your honey
Pants on her slim fit
Lights in the room dim lit
And I'm feeling on your booty
On some R Kelly and Lil Kim shit
Pants on her slim fit
Lights in the room dim lit
And I'm feeling on your booty
On some R Kelly and Lil Kim shit

[Hook: The Dream]
Slow it down
Down down down, down down down
So she can take her time and work it on me, mane
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
Whisper in her ear while she on me, mane
You gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
Just swing it left, swing it right
DJ you gotta slow it down
Down down down, down down down
Oh That's what she likes
DJ you got to slow it ahoo

[Outro: The Dream]
I'mma keep it real with you baby you bad ahoo
Kinda like Michael Jackson, Jacko you're bad ahoo
If you was my girl and you left me I be sad ahoo
Enough of that, let me see that ass (drop)
