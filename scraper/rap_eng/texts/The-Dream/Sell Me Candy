[Verse 1]
Sell me candy like it’s summer when it’s melting in my hands
I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

[Verse 2]
You could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body, now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core (you know)

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss

[Verse 3]
I wanna play, more than you know
So don’t you leave, and don’t you go
I want it all until time falls
His arms, I want to roam
I wanna love, give him my trust
I wanna live, for both of us
I wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm you when nights get colder
I want love, love, love
I want love, love, love

[Chorus]
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
(I’m the daddy) You the boss
