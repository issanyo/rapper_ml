I'm not the same as them, I'm not the one
So you better take care of me
If I fight for you, you better fight for me
Take care of me

I'll build you up, to the sky
Girl, I'll take care of you
I'll never wrong you, I'll never lie
I'll take care of you

But don't take my love for granted
Girl, don't take my love for granted
Act like you'll always need me
Act like you only see me

Don't take my heart for granted
And don't take my heart and strand it
Don't turn my love to hate
Put back in it what you take

Or I will break you down, you down
I will break you down, I'll break you down
Girl, I will break you down, I'll break you down
Girl, I'll break you down, I'll break you down, girl

I wear my heart on my shirt
So beware of me
Every thought, will be a thought of you
Girl, beware of me

Mini hell shattered my spirits
So I'll be aware of you
And if you fool me once, you'll never fool me again
I'll be aware of you

So don't take, don't, don't so don't don't
So so don't take my love for granted
Girl, don't take my love for granted
Say that you only see me
Say that you'll always need me

Don't take my heart for granted
Don't take my heart and strand it
I can turn this love to hate
Anytime I want to any day

I will break us down, us down
I will break us down, I'll break us down
Girl, I will break us down, I'll break us down
Girl I'll break us down, I'll break us down girl

I wear my heart on my shirt
So beware of me
Every thought will be a thought of you
Girl, beware of me

I will break us down, us down
I will break us down, I'll break us down
Girl, I will break us down, I'll break us down
Girl, I'll break us down, I'll break us down girl

Not giving love without it being returned
You can't profit from a love that's never been earned
Nothing is forever except forever
Love shouldn't just be an endeavor, endeavor, endeavor
