[Intro]
L to the O, V to the E
K to the I, N to the G
I don't know how they treat you
How they do it where you at
But all I'm tryna say is you should know me like that

(Killah!)
I'm just sayin' (It's the R&B Killah)
I'm just sayin' (you should know me like that)
(It's the R&B Killah)

Your man said get my money up
Get my money up
So I went and got my money up
And now I got this money up

[Verse 1]
I'm in the Hawai-i
Dream dropped another one, tell dem niggas bye-bye
I got girls in da club, girls in the church
Pull 'em all day, I take them off work
Got girls in the draft, girls on my label
Girls at the bank, cause I'm about my paper
Got girls with weave, girls without it
She like, "This all mine", hmmm...I doubt it
Girls in New York, girls in L.A
Got girls in Miami, or wherever you stay
Got girls in Chicago, girls in Toronto
Girls in Paris, go anywhere I wanna go

Half to my main girl, quarter to my side chick
I be on that fly shit and you be on my shit
Y'all niggas keep playin', change where you layin'
I'm just sayin'

[Chorus]
L to the O, V to the E
K to the I, N to the G
I don't know how they treat you
How they do it where you at
But all I'm tryna say is you should know me like that

If you don't know me like that, if you don't know me like that
If you don't know me like that, if you don't know me like that
Girl, you should know me like that, you should know me like that
You should know me like that, you should know me like that

[Verse 2]
I got girls in heels, girls in Adidas
Tracy, Kim, Tameka, Fatima
Got girls on the Nuvo, girls on Patron
Girls on that Belvedere, pay me for the song
Got girls on my Sprint, my AT&T
Got girls on T-Mobile, metro if it's local
Some fly private, some fly Delta
Some of 'em act sadity, some of 'em do whatever
Got a girl that's shy, a girl that's a freak
Got a girl when I'm sick, she watch what I eat
Got a girl up in Target, a girl outta college
Sorry ladies but there ain't nothing like a smart bitch

Half to my main girl, quarter to my side chick
I be on that fly shit and you be on my shit
Y'all niggas keep playin', change where you layin'
I'm just sayin'

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If your man ain't treating you right
Shawty let me get a "Ooh, whoa..." (Ooh, whoa...)
If your man ain't paying your right
Shawty let me get a "Ooh, whoa..." (Ooh, whoa...)
If your hair ain't done and your nails ain't fixed
Put your hands in the air if you know you da shit
Let me get a "Uh, uh, uh, uh, ooh, whoa"
Let me get a "Uh, uh, uh, uh, ooh, whoa"

[Chorus]

Yes ! L.O.S. !
If you don't know me like that (Radio Killah)
If you don't know me if you don't know me
If you don't know me, you should know me
Ohhhhh
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Uh, oooh, ah
Uh, oooh, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
You should know me like that
You better already know me like that
Ah, ah, ah
If you don't know me like
If you don't know me like
If you don't know me like
If you don't know me like
Girl, you should know me like
You should know me like
You should know me like
Know me like that
