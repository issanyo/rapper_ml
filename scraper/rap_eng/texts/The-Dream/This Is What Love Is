[Verse 1:]
See See
I love you [x3] (Oh Baby)
Baby Imma show em what you missin (Imma show em what you missin)
Baby all you need is my kisses
Hey nothing (nothing) I'm gunna spoil you with my riches (Let me spend a little money on you)
Hey young thing I heard your hearts broken let me fix it (Yeah Yeah)
Know you've never had a girl quiet like me but you gone see just let me just take you out (take you out)
Let me invite you in to my city everything is pretty
Let me show you what I'm about

[Bridge:]
Just wanna love you, let me love you, swear I love you, oh baby
Just wanna love you, let me love you, swear I love you, until you crazy

[Chorus:]
I wanna make you insane (I wanna make you)
Insane
Insane (Go Crazy)
There nothing about this, this is what love is [x2]
Passion, faith, hope, this is what love is
Hooked on each other like dough, this is what love is
Lips, chest, hips this is what love is
Joy never seen the end like this, because this is what love is

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, baby, I'm more than just a lover (more than just a lover, lover)
Baby is waitin on you to discover
I know just why you by yourself
Cause u feel you ain't got no one else
But I can be that girl, and I can be your world
Use me till there's nothing left

[Bridge:]
