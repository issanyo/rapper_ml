I can love harder you wanna know ?

Got the key to your heart and we are never far apart unlock and feel the pain the you gave me to gain as you lock me in Chains

Woah uh oh Baby tell me why what did I do wrong gave you my heart and you ripped it apart uh oh

Chains you got me in Chain and I can break , break from you love trying to break the chains but you only break me you got me in you got me in chains uh oh

Blood as love pain I always seem to gain nothing in my lane nothing but pain

Baby tell me why you did me wrong gave you my heart and you ripped it apart chains chains uh oh chains
