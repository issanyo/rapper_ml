[Intro]
Wake me when it's over
Wake me when it's over

[Verse 1]
I hate it when you go, I love to watch you leave
I hate the way you talk to me, I love you in them jeans
You so disrespectful, but damn, I love your style
But shit, you're so neglectful, how long have you been out?
What have you been drinkin'? What have I been doin'?
Where I was last night? Did you mean "who I been screwin'?"
Life on the internet, I look like the devil
But you're wearing the red dress, holding a shovel
Tried to keep it hush for you, keep it on the low
Tried to spare your feelings, girl shut the door

[Hook]
You knew it was over
I knew it was over
Everyone knew it was over
Wake me when it's over

[Verse 2]
I love the way you smell, but you always on some bullshit
I love how your body feels, why must we do this?
Stop with the excuses, I hate procrastination
You never had no one like me, well, why you so complacent?
And now I'm feeling crazy and foolish
I hate that I'm impatient, damn, we look so stupid

[Bridge]
It was all downhill
When you let them in our business
Thought that I could save you
Then we died in the abyss
Raise your hand if he was there (I)
Raise your hand if you care (I)
But I'll bite the bullet for your love
I'll cock back and pull it for your love

[Hook]

[Post-Hook]
It's so easy to throw you under that bus that you ridin' on
It's so easy to take you off that cloud that you call home
It's so easy to expose those who you love the most
But it's so hard to disregard and keep your mouth closed
I'll take the bullets, you can pull it

[Bridge]
Raise your hand if you care (I)
Raise your hand if you were there (I)
Got me out here takin', takin', takin' bullets

[Hook]
Even though you knew it was over
And I knew it was over
All our friends knew it was over
Now just wake me when it's over

[Outro]
Yeah, eh, eh, eh eh eh
Yeah, eh, eh, eh eh eh
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la
La la la, la la la, la la la, la
La la la, la la la, la la la, la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
Sing it with me
La la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
La la la, la la la, la la la
