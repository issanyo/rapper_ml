[Intro]
I wanna rock your body, your body, your body, your (baby)
Your body, your body, your body (baby)

[Verse 1]
Girl I can’t lie, I can’t deny
Girl I came to get me some
Please don't lie, don't be shy
Let me taste your love in my tongue
Put your lips on my lips
When I dip, you dip, we dip
Take off on my rocket ship
I know you know what it is

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm hmm, good lovin’
That grindin’, that bumpin’
That aww yeah, that bed shake
That next day, body ache
So shawty get up on it
I’ma make that body go from left to the right
From side to side
Now I’m gon' get behind it
And I'ma make that thing ride, ride
Roc, roc, roc, roc
Roc, roc, roc

[Chorus]
I wanna rock your body, your body, your body, your (baby)
Your body, your body, your body (baby)
When I’m making love to you girl
Feel like I’m on top of the world
Your body, your body, your body (baby)

[Verse 2]
There's so much I wanna say
Tryna keep my composure babe
While you're holding me
I hope you’ll always be my lady
I must admit what you're doing got me going insane
Poppin’ it, droppin' it, oh yeah babe

[Pre-Chorus]
Mmm hmm, good lovin’
That grindin’, that bumpin’
That aww yeah, that bed shake

Then pull it up, pull it up, baby there you go (that body)
