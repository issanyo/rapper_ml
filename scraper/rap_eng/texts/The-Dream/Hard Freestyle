[Verse One]:
I'm sorta the poster child of my region
Ain't no doubt it's my season
A couple thousand I'm reachin', a gold album I'm creepin'
Up the charts
Y'all niggas is just as proud as the teachers
Who said I'd never make it, y'all just out in the bleachers
I'm in the game, watch as I do my thang
I'm blockin' 'em out the lane
Monster what I became
Nigga how you gon' be a leader
When you spendin' your re-up on hotels and divas
Reefer and senoritas
Jesus what's goin' on?
Why you forsaken Shawn?
Don't I pray enough, try to stay out the way enough?
At the cribo layin' up
Fuck is they hatin' for?
Oh I know, be patient brah
Anxious to make a buck
Stop complainin' and start droppin' bangers
If the tops where you aimin', gotta watch the great ones
Keep gossipin' and hatin'
I be rockin' stages
Boardroom to the block got it locked, be patient
You know the name cuz

[Verse Two]:
I did it without a track from Kanye
Beat from Dr. Dre
Hook from T-Pain
Co-sign from Jay
The 16 from Drake
Cameo from Snoop
Dance like Soulja Boy, you gotta salute
How I came in the game
Took it back to the essence
Put it back in perspective
What an immaculate conception
I'm complex
Still ain't make the cover of Complex
Bomb sets
For tryin' to intercept my conquest
Talks about a new west
Still ain't got the answer to the question, "Who's next?"
I'll help you out
His name starts with an F
He's 5'9", grew an inch since he last left
The kid can rhyme
Heard some joints that he had on cassette, blew my mind
I should convert them to MP3's put 'em online
I'm not in my prime, not yet one of a kind
Shine like the sun through your bedroom blinds
Nigga I'm...
