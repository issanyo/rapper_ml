Baby (x8)
Put your Monica on my biggie (baby)
Put that Veronica on my biggie (baby)
Get that harmonica on my semi (baby)
Baby, get it juicy from me like I'm biggie (baby)
Can't take my eyes off you, but it could be the lights
And them pitch black shadows, and that ass just right!
And now I'm all in your world, wanna know what it feel
Wanna know how that feel, make me pay your bills
Your body is talking shit, but I'mma need you to bring you to life

[Hook]
Wanna see that shit you're talking about
That body duet, that body duet
Wanna see that shit you're talking about
Make that body duet, that body duet
I can hear that shit come about your mouth
The thing you make your body do it
Duet, duet, duet

No need to fight, you got me, baby
You're my type, fucking amazing
Can't even ask, you got me crazy
Got me so hot, oh shit, I'm faded!
And I already know just what you like, what you like, baby
I already know just what I like, so decide, baby!
Both on that pedestal just collide, let's collide, baby
Ready to go, ready to go, whatsup!
Now I'm all in your world, wanna know what it feel
Wanna know how that feel, make me pay your bills!
Your body's talking shit, but I'mma need you to bring it to life

[Hook]
Wanna see that shit you're talking about
Make that body duet, that body duet
Wanna see that shit you're talking about
Make that body duet, that body duet
I can hear that shit come about your mouth
But can you make your body do it
(Can you make your body do it)
Duet, duet, duet

Your body's calling on me
There's nothing but space and opportunity
Let me take care of the special things
Don't stop me now and talk that shit to me, yeah!

[Hook]
Wanna see that shit you're talking about
Make that body duet, that body duet
Wanna see that shit you're talking about
Make that body duet, that body duet
I can hear that shit come about your mouth
But can you make your body do it
Wanna see that shit you're talking about
That that body duet, that body duet
Duet, duet, duet
