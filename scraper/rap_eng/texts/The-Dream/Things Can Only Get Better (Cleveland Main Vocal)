You can walk my path, you can wear my shoes
Learn to talk like me and be an angel too
But maybe you ain't never gonna feel this way
You ain't never gonna know me but I know you
I'm singing it now, things can only get better
They can only get better if we see it through
That means me and I mean you too
So teach me now that things can only get better
They can only get, they only get, take it on from here
You know, I know that things can only get better
I sometimes lose myself in me, I lose track of time
And I can't see the wood for the trees, you set them alight
Burning bridges as you've gone, I'm too weak to fight ya
I've got my personal hell to deal with, then you say
Walk my path, wear my shoes, talk like that
I'll be an angel then, things can only get better
They can only get better now I found you
Things can only get better, they can only get better
Now I found you and you and you
You have shown me prejudice and greed
And you've shown me how I must learn to deal with this disease
I look at things now in a different light than I did before
And I've found the cause and I think you can be my cure
So teach me to walk your path, wear your shoes, talk like that
I'll be an angel and things can only get better
