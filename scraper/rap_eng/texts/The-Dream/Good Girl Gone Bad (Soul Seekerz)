[Verse 1]
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

[Verse 2]
He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh

[Chorus]
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

(Easy for a good girl to go bad)
(Easy for a good girl to go bad)

Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

[Outro]
We done forever
