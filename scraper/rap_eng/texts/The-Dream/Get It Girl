You know I get it in cause my money gone
So all you other broads better run along
And if you think you hittin' then you dead wrong, then you dead wrong

If you stack paper leave ya haters in the rear view

Everybody keep the change all drinks on me ahh

You know I get it in cause my money long
So all you other broads better run along
And if you think you hittin' then you dead wrong, then you dead wrong
