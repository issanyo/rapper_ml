[Verse 1]
If I was your girl
Boy, I'd show and prove
That I can do all of those things
That the other girls just can't do
Oh boy, if I was your girl
You would never be blue
Red heels, lips sealed
Except when they on you

[Chorus]
Let's do it, let's do it
Let's do it, let's do it
Ah ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
We ain't got no problems
You ain't got no worries
You already ride up
Why you in a hurry
This me in my normal state
Let me give you my best
I don't ever need to be on X
Unless you my ex

[Outro]
Let me pray with you
Spend all day with you
For once can I just keep it real
Let my hair down and just be sensitive
I'm just a girl
