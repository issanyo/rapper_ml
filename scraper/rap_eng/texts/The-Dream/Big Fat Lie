[Verse 1]
I ain't never had my heart broken
When I say that, I should start choking
I could say I never lacked a father figure
But I only seek out men to be my father figure
I'm never alone, I'm so famous
But still I'm prescribed pills to make it painless
I'm so pretty, huh, got it so goodie, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
California days, they say it never rains
But why does it seems my make-up's never dry
And if my life's like a perfect sky
Why I feel gray inside?
And if I'm living such a wonderful high
Why don't I feel alive
But I'm a keep my tears to me
But the truth between me and you
Just know I'm living a big fat lie

[Chorus]
Lie, lie, lie, lie
You know I love to lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie
I'm living a big fat lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie
You know I love to lie
If you look past my features, just a little deeper
I'm living a big fat lie

[Verse 2]
Airbrush on my pictures
Make my legs a little thinner
Eyes just a little lighter
Now make my ass just a little bigger
Yeah, now autotune my tone
Big smile, take a bow
Go with it, read the prompter

[Pre-Chorus]
California days, they say it never rains
But why does it seems my make-up's never dry
And if my life's like a perfect sky
Why I feel gray inside?
And if I'm living such a wonderful high
Why don't I feel alive
But I'ma keep my tears to me
But the truth between me and you
Just know I'm living a big fat lie

[Chorus]
Lie, lie, lie, lie
You know I love to lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie
I'm living a big fat lie
Lie, lie, lie, lie
You know I love to lie
If you look past my features, just a little deeper
I'm living a big fat lie

[Verse 3]
Only a problem has all the answers
That's the secret
And I don't wanna fail you
But I wish I could tell you
It's our little secret

[Bridge]
(You know I love to lie)
Lie, lie, lie, lie
You know I love to lie
(You know I love to lie)
Lie, lie, lie, lie
I'm living a big fat lie
(You know I love to lie)
Lie, lie, lie, lie
You know I love to lie

[Outro]
If you look past my features, just a little deeper
I'm living a big fat lie
