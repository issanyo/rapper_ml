You must've been lying when you said you loved me
And I must've been lying when I cared about you, baby
'Cause everything we had done caught on fire

And we here standing in the ashes of desire

We were ready to jump
Ready to run
Ready to come aboard
Set sail from the docks
Boat full of holes
Down goes love

Rain don't fall upside down
There's standing lakes, they're on both sides of the ground
And those rivers, they never run dry
And once you're under that water
We'll never see you cry

Now, how could I have lied when I said I loved you
You couldn't have been lying when you said you loved me too
'Cause if it wasn't loving, it wouldn't hurt so bad
But with all that said, it still didn't work, and that's so sad

We were ready to jump
Ready to run
Ready to come aboard
We set sail from the docks
In a boat full of holes
Down goes love

Rain don't fall upside down
There's standing lakes, they're on both sides of the ground
And those rivers, they never run dry
And once you're under that water
We'll never see you cry

Water never misses a corner, unlike light
And water has no conversation for something, just fight
Still I know something
Between you and I
To reach a love that's under siege
We're just fish out of sea
There's tons of ?? drowning underneath

Rain don't fall upside down
There's standing lakes, they're on both sides of the ground
And those rivers, they never run dry
And once you're under that water
We'll never see you cry
