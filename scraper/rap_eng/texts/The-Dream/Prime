[Verse 1]
What do you want? Tell me what you need
Everything and anything baby, I be for you
I give you a world
But do you believe me in mlike I believe in you
15 I was stacking my bread
By 20 I made sure none of the success went to my head
By 25 everybody expected me to be dead
By 30 I did exactly what I said

[Hook]
I know you think you're out of my league
But I'm tryna tell you girl I'm in my prime
I know you think I'll never find nobody like you
I bet you'll never find nobody like me
I'm tryna tell you I'm in my prime
And I know you think you're out of my league
Say you'll never find nobody like you
But I bet you'll never find nobody like me
And I guess we'll wait and see

[Verse 2]
Now I need that kind of love
Somebody to share it with
Keep sake, hold it [?] afloat
My angelica, no replica for pete's sake
Tell me that you bout it
Tell me that you want me
Cause I'm all about it
Trust me and believe it
I'm on a high and there's nothing I can't see
Nothing we can't be

[Hook]

[Outro]
Know your letters I kept with me
The last one postmarked 6-12-03
I'm in my prime girl, I'm in my prime baby
I'm in my prime, I'm in my prime baby
I'm in my prime baby, I'm in my prime
I'm in my prime babay, I'm in my prime
I'm in my prime baby, I'm in my prime
Prime, I'm in my prime
I'm in my prime
