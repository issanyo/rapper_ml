[Hook: The-Dream & Travie McCoy]
I like girls
They like me
They look so cute in their 7 Jeans
Want you to be the one
And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar

[Verse 1: Travie McCoy]
You see I got this problem
I need help trying to solve it
'Cuz meeting after meeting
And I'm still a cookie-holic
And I'm still a cookie-holic
You can hide 'em, I'ma find 'em
On the counter, in the closet
And I'll say I ain't do it
With my face covered in chocolate
My girl be setting booby traps
To catch me eating Scooby Snacks
I left crumbs in the bed once
But I told her I was through with that
She still don't be believing me
And I guess that I'm cool with that
But I got a sweet tooth
That'll never come loose
And the fact of the matter is

[Hook: The-Dream & Travie McCoy]
I like girls
They like me

And my only
I want to be faithful
But I can't keep my hands out the cookie jar

My hands, my hands, my haha... my hands
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my ha... my
(Big shouts out to Gym Class Heroes!)
Can't keep my hands, my hands, my hands out the cookie jar
(What up Travis!)
Cookie Jar!
