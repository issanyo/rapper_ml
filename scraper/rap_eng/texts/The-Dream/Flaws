[Intro]
(Hey yeah yeah yeah)
(Hey yeah yeah yeah)
(Hey yeah yeah yeah)
(Hey yeah yeah yeah)
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I know you're lying
But sometimes I wanna feel good deep inside it
Hurts so bad but it feels so good I can't deny it
Feels like heaven on earth but the pain exemplifies it
It keeps me quiet
At night when

[Chorus]
I love you flaws and all
I need you flaws and all
I'll waste my time flaws and all
I don't mind your flaws at all

[Verse 2]
I love to fight it
'cause making up makes me forget that I was crying
And breaking up makes perfect sense it sparks the fire
You're such a liar
But you're my sweet desire
And I just can't get enough of your love

[Chorus]
I love you flaws and all
I need you flaws and all
I'll waste my time flaws and all
I don't mind your flaws at all

[Verse 3]
I know you're trying
So I ain't giving up on you I'll wait I promise
'cause I got faith that one day you'll get it together
Ain't nothing perfect but the way you put your loving down on me

[Chorus]
I love you flaws and all (I love you ayy)
I need you flaws and all (I said I love you yeah)
I'll waste my time flaws and all (I'm gonna waste my time)
I don't mind your flaws at all (I need you)

[Chorus]
I love you flaws and all (I need you all ayy)
I need you flaws and all (I need you flaws and all)
I'll waste my time flaws and all
I don't mind your flaws at all (I don't mind I need you)
