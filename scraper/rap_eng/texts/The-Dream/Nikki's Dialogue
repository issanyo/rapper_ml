[Verse]
(I), told you your nigga wasn't gon' be 'bout it, didn't I? (I)
Some new love you found
But I see you found yourself without it (I)
We all gotta learn them lessons (I)
All good 'til you miscount blessings (I)
And that pretty body got you a ring
I told you that pussy ain't everything (I)
Didn't I tell you that we'd probably never get this back? (I)
And all that searchin' for what's perfect just set your ass back (I)
Told you what it was (I), told you what it be (I)
Told you what would happen if you ran that game on me (I)
Made a whole album about you niggas won't ever hear (I)
Loved you like cooked food, but you had no clue, did you? (I)
I fell in love again without you
Heard you back livin' alone, I wouldn't doubt it
I swore that I couldn't live without you
Just when you thought that I couldn't live without you

[Chorus]
Oh Nikki, Nikki, I've known you so long
You went and did what felt right, just admit you were dead wrong
You told me to standby, I told you to come home
You told me to do me, and I'm still goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Nicole
My Nicole
My life changed and you changed
And we changed and just like that, gone
Don't sit there, girl, say somethin' to me (Hello?)

[Chorus]
Oh Nikki, Nikki, I've known you so long
You went and did what felt right, just admit you were dead wrong
You told me to standby, I told you to come home
You told me to do me, and I'm still goin'

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Nicole
My Nicole
My life changed and you changed
And we changed and just like that, gone
Don't sit there, girl (Answer me)
