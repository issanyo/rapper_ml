[Part 1: Bow Down]

[Chorus]
I'm out that H-town
Comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H, H-town-town, I'm comin' down
Comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground

[Verse 1]
I know when you were little girls
You dreamt of bein' in my world
Don't forget it, don't forget it
Respect that, bow down bitches (Crown)
I took some time to live my life
But don't think I'm just his little wife
Don't get it twisted, get it twisted
This my shit, bow down bitches

[Bridge]
Bow down bitches, bow-bow down bitches (Crown)
Bow down bitches, bow-bow down bitches (Crown)
H-Town vicious, H, H-Town vicious
I'm so crown, crown, bow down bitches

[Chorus]
I'm out that H-town
Comin', comin' down
I'm comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground
H, H-town-town, I'm comin' down
Com-com-comin' down, drippin' candy on the ground

[Part 2: ***Flawless]

[Intro: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie]
We teach girls to shrink themselves, to make themselves smaller
We say to girls: "You can have ambition, but not too much
You should aim to be successful, but not too successful
Otherwise, you will threaten the man"
Because I am female, I am expected to aspire to marriage
I am expected to make my life choices
Always keeping in mind that marriage is the most important
Now, marriage can be a source of joy and love and mutual support
But why do we teach girls to aspire to marriage
And we don't teach boys the same?
We raise girls to see each other as competitors
Not for jobs or for accomplishments, which I think can be a good thing
But for the attention of men
We teach girls that they cannot be sexual beings in the way that boys are
Feminist: a person who believes in the social, political
And economic equality of the sexes

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' 'round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn!

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Mama taught me good home training
My Daddy taught me how to love my haters
My sister told me I should speak my mind
My man made me feel so God damn fine (I'm flawless!)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
You wake up, flawless
Post up, flawless
Ridin' round in it, flawless
Flossin' on that, flawless
This diamond, flawless
My diamond, flawless
This rock, flawless
My Roc, flawless
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
I woke up like this, I woke up like this
We flawless, ladies tell 'em
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn
Say "I look so good tonight"
God damn, God damn, God damn!
