[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland]
Boy, you got a bitch zonin'
Its damn near five inna morning
Kinda wish that I could clone it
For the times when your not around, yeah
Boy, I'll never leave you lonely
Be your one and only
You need a main girl
That fucks you like a side chick
Let go and stop fuckin' around

[Hook]
You need that sexy girl
That independent
That ridin' around this bitch and getting it
That no blogging
That hustle hard at home, on the job
Put it on ya like "Ooh Lord!"
Real shit, no fraud
Hit the mall, then buy you something
I ain't frontin'

[Bridge]
Don't nobody do it like you do
I'm so ATL
And I'm so Houston
Baby, can't you tell
That I know what I'm doing
Baby, can't you tell
That I know what I'm doing

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Thinking oh you got me crazy
Shit
Calling you baby
Questions I used to say no to
Now it's maybe
Picture you turning me out
All good, all hood
I can make sure your love is never misunderstood
I'll have you like she never had you
Stop fucking around

[Hook]
You need that sexy girl
That independent
That ridin' around this bitch and getting it
That no blogging
That hustle hard at home, on the job
Put it on ya like "Ooh Lord!"
Real shit, no fraud
Hit the mall, then buy you something
I ain't frontin'

[Bridge]
Don't nobody do it like you do
I'm so ATL
I'm so Houston
Baby, can't you tell

[Verse 3: Kelly Rowland]
Don't care
Where you been
Who you been with
How it ended
Just love me
I don't care how recent
Sure you got your reasons
Boy pick up your future
And leave the past
I'll take your good and your bad

[Verse 4: The Dream]
First off: fuck Wendy Williams, fuck TMZ
Fuck these fake niggas
These niggas ain't half me
You know the clique, you see the chain
Jordan's on, Oozie earrings
And I'm here with you
They can't hold me down (they can't hold me down)
Black and ugly as ever, shit, however
They know they still rockin' with the best ever

[Bridge: Kelly Rowland]
Don't nobody do me like you do
I'm so ATL
Boy, I'm so Houston
Baby, can't you tell
Tell
Tell
Baby can't tell
