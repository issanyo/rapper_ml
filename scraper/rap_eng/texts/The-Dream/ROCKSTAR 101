[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm a rockstar (rockstar)
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar (rockstar)
Hey baby
Big cities (big cities)
Bright lights (bright lights)
Sleep all day (all day)
Long nights
Baby, I'm a rockstar (rockstar)
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar (rockstar)
Hey baby, it's big cities (big cities)
Bright lights (bright lights)
Sleep all day (all day)
Long nights (long nights)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Six-inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm a rockstar (rockstar)

Bright lights (bright lights)
Sleep all day (all day)
Long nights (long nights)

Hey

'Cause I can't wait 'til tomorrow
I'ma live my whole life in the night
'Cause I ain't got time to borrow

Why wait 'til tomorrow
