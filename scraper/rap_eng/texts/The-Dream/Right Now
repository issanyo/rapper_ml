[Chorus: Rihanna]
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Baby, tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go
Whenever, baby, I'm yours

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
So close, I can taste you
Ain't scared, I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Got me fiendin'
You got me fiendin'
Something you wanted to do all your life
There's no more waiting, tonight is the night
And it can't be wrong, not if it feels this right
Turn it up
Scream it loud, yeah

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now
