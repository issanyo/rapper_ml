[Verse]
So this is Christmas
And what have you done
Another year over
A new one just begun
And so this is Christmas
I hope you have fun
The near and the dear ones
The old and the young

[Pre-Chorus]
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear

[Chorus]
And so this is Christmas (War is Over, if you want it, war is over now) [repeat with verse]
For weak and for strong
The rich and the poor ones
The road is so long
So happy Christmas
For black and for white
For yellow and red ones
Let's stop all the fight

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]
A very merry Christmas
And a happy New Year
Let's hope it's a good one
Without any fear
War is over, if you want it
War is over now

[Outro]
Merry Christmas
