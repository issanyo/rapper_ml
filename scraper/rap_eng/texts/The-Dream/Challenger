[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Girl, I've been starin’ at your picture all day
Girl, I mean I've been lookin' at your fuckin’ pussy all day
And them screenshots you sent me really go a long way
But girl, I need you bad, how bad? Always
You shouldn't have never told me that your nigga wasn't the shit
You shouldn't have never told me you know I would wanna hit
You shouldn't have never told me that your man never around
Anything else to tell me, girl? Go on and tell me now

[Pre-Chorus]
He don't want you like I want you
He just wanna dress you up, stress you out
And treat you like a fool

[Chorus 1]
Jump in this Challenger, let's (Ride, ride, ride, ride)
In here, and (Ride)
Get in my car, baby, let's (Ride, ride, ride, ride)
Come on, girl (Ride)
Jump in this Challenger, and (Ride, ride, ride, ride)
Switch gears and (Ride)
You not his, yeah (Ride, ride, ride, ride)
No more tears, let’s (Ride)
Get over here, let’s (Ride)

[Verse 2]
You shouldn't have never told me that you cosigned on his shit
You shouldn’t have never told me he moved in and didn't pay rent
You shouldn't have never told me he don't do shit for his baby
He gon’ call this hate, but shawty, I'm just sayin'

[Pre-Chorus]
He don't want you like I want you
He just wanna dress you up, stress you out
And treat you like a fool

[Chorus 2]
Get in this Challenger, let's (Ride, ride, ride, ride)
In this car, let's (Ride)
Girl, get in this car, let's (Ride, ride, ride, ride)
Yeah, get over here, let's (Ride)
Jump in this Challenger, let's (Ride, ride, ride, ride)
No more fear, baby, yeah (Ride)
No more tears, baby, yeah (Ride, ride, ride, ride)
Oh baby, jump up in this car, and let's ride (Ride)
Oh, I'm just sayin', we gon' ride

[Outro]
Girl, I've been starin' at your picture all day
Girl, I mean I've been lookin' at your fuckin' pussy all day
And them screenshots you sent me really go a long way
But girl, I need you bad, how bad? Always
