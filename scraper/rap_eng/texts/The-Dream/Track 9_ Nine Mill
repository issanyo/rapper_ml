[Intro]
I'm still about my bacon homie
If you told me to quit
Now you're looking like a prick
I've getting sweet kicks
From murdering shit
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go again
Here we go
Hol' up

[Hook 1]
These niggas wanna hold me back, these niggas wanna hold me back
These niggas wanna hold me back, these niggas wanna hold me back
These niggas wanna hold me back, these niggas wanna hold me back
These niggas wanna hold me back, these niggas wanna hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back, these hoes won't hold me back
These hoes won't hold me back, these hoes won't hold me back
These niggas wanna hold me back, these niggas wanna hold me back
These niggas wanna hold me back, these niggas...

[Verse 1]
Yuh, loading upon my .22
White girls want me to dump my girl and the black girls want me to too
Trinny girls wanna start that beef but the .44's ready shoot shoot
Lil Kenny wanna kill some niggas? Well let me kill some too too
Fuck with me you know I got it, 9 0's you know I want it
People wanna come and try to beef
But I pull out the whip, don't get me started
Put out the zip, don't get me fleeced
I got the 47 that gets you freezed
If a nigga tryna ever come and fuck with me
I got the 9 mill for your nephew and niece
Bang

[Hook 2 ]
Don't fuck with me, you know I'll do it
If you fuck with me, you know I'll do it
Fuck with me and I'll start shooting
Don't fuck with me, you know I'll do it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
(It's really about enjoying the pleasures of life while you still got em, y'nah mean?)
Sexy bitch, I hope she 'bout it
Come fuck with me, you know I got it

[Verse 2]
I just copped that Bugatti
The Gianni's; the Versace
The Enzo's; the Ferrari
Got 9 Mill in Milani
Got a bad bitch and she wants me
Got a side chick in Armani
Got a 9 mill loaded with 9 mill diamond
Got million dollar icing
I'm a modern day pharaoh
Got gold in my tomb for the dead broke
If want me to be broke and dead
I will whip your head boy
I got A Billi but it’s just for me
Money to be making this masterpiece
Money for my bitchess and money for my kids
I got the 9 mill for my nephew and niece
Bang!

[Hook 1]

[Outro]
I've been getting my shit nigga
In the studio making hits nigga
Your girl sucked my dick nigga
Wait hol' up...

[Postlude: The-Dream]
One shot from that 12 gauge body go boom
2 shots from that gun till that pussy go numb

[Interlude: Daryl Verah]
You niggas can’t stunt on jumper like me
I got that Dedication and its featuring me
I seen a few people that liked my Good News
But I got better news cause I'm following suit
You following me or am I following you?
I got a few reasons why I drop so much bacon
Just look what I'm making
You see that I'm taking time out to give these fools a little education
