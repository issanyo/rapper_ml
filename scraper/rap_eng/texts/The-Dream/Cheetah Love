No matter where I go, I'll still be the same

And this girl wants to have some fun!
So putcho' hands up, cause we've only begun

[Pre-Chorus 1: Chanel]
And there's no stoppin' us, because
We've got that Cheetah Love!
(Oh!)

[Chorus: The Cheetah Girls]
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls
We stick together for life
Sometimes we don't see eye-to-eye
But we roll side by side
There is nothing in the world that we can't overcome
Strength in numbers, got each other, got that Cheetah Love!

When I really needchya' two, you put me first

[Aqua]
And my girls, they've always got my back
No matter what happens, I can count on that!
(Oh!)

[Chanel]
And when I wanna escape it all
My sisters are always gonna be my first call!

[Pre-Chorus 2: Chanel]
Cause there's no stoppin' us, because

(Oh!)

[Chorus: The Cheetah Girls]
We are Cheetah, Cheetah Girls

And if they try, we will still survive!
