[Intro/Post-Hook]
Shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog
Shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog
Shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog
Shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog

[Verse 1]
You seen her walkin' through
Hartsfield International
On her way to see me
She's far from the girl that you used to know
Flossin' keys to your phantom and you know that she's my girl
Still you try to get at her
But she put the brakes on that shit like (SKKRT)
And I don't blame you 'cause, God, the girl look good
She said she couldn't even if she could

[Hook]
She needs my love
She said I'm like the air and without me, she'll die
If it ain't my love
You better have a doctor on stand-by

[Post-Hook]
Shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog
Shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog
Shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog
Shawty need my love, sh-sh-shawty need my love, dog

[Verse 2]
You seen us walkin' through the club
Little Fendi skirt lettin' them panties show
She grindin' on me (me)
I see you tryin' too flirt with her on the low (what)
Flossin' keys too your rover boy you know that that's my girl
I left and you made your way over
But she push the brakes on that shit likem (SKKRT)
And I can't blame u cause God damn the girl is fine she said she can't because shes mine mine min mine mine mine

[Hook]
She needs my love
She said I'm like the air and without me, she'll die
If it ain't my love

[Verse 3]
Yessir!
From the look of my wardrobe I can see why you mad though
See me up in Bankhead, chillin' with a bad ho
Tell Oprah I'm sorry, I really meant to say bad though
She keep them thongs ch-ch-ch-chewin' on her asshole
I'm all up on her ass though, runnin' it like I'm Castro
I'm still hood even though my bank account upper-class, ho
We 3 minutes into the song, but still nigga, you mad though
But nah he squintin' from my wrist 'cause my wrist got the mad glow

[Hook]
She needs my love
She said I'm like the air and without me, she'll die
If it ain't my love
You better have a doctor on stand-by

[Bridge]
Call 9-1-1 if my love ain't there
Call 9-1-1 tell paramedics to bring her air (air, air, air)
Call 9-1-1 if my love ain't there
Call 9-1-1 tell paramedics to bring her air (air, air, air) [2X]

[Outro]
She needs my love
You better have a doctor on stand-by
