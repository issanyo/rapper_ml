[Verse 1]
Honey, honey
I can see the stars all the way from here
Can't you see the glow on the window pane?
I can feel the sun whenever you're near
Every time you touch me I just melt away

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
They say love hurts but I know
It's gonna take a little work
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally, you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

[Verse 2]
Baby, baby, I can feel the wind whipping past my face
As we dance the night away
Boy your lips taste like a night of champagne
As I kiss you again, and again, and again, and again

[Pre-Chorus]
Now everybody asks me why I'm smiling out from ear to ear
They say love hurts but I know
It's gonna take a little work
Nothing's perfect, but it's worth it
After fighting through my tears
And finally, you put me first

[Chorus 1]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I can always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top
Ooh, come on, baby!
You put my love on top, top, top, top, top
You put my love on top

[Chorus 2]
Baby, it's you, you're the one I love
You're the one I need, you're the only thing I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always call
When I need you, baby, everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, you're the one that I love
Baby, you're all I need
You're the only one I see
Come on, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one I always call
When I need you, make everything stop
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top

Baby, 'cause you're the one that I love
Baby, you're the one that I need
You're the only one I see
Baby, baby, it's you
You're the one that gives your all
You're the one that always calls
When I need you everything stops
Finally, you put my love on top
