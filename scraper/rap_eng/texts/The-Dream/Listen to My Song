[Verse 1]
You want me, I'll be there
Just call me on my phone it takes me away
When you need me I'll be there, just whisper
And I'll grab your voice when I'll be hearing
Boy I'm here with you, you're here with me
Just letting me know you always will be mine
Boy I'm loving you, you're loving me
Don't hold it back, just let it be

[Hook]
See you ain't never gone on and never gonna leave
And boy you're gonna be right here with me
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
And you ain't gone want never ever want you never gonna cry
I will be right here by your side
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
My love will never do you wrong
Now listen to my song, now listen to my song, boy listen to my song

[Verse 2]
I gonna give you everything, giving you my love is my only mission
Promise you I'll never let my
All my kisses, all my hugs, public affection, that's for some
If you are not a paper, I were not a savior
Even if you went back in the days you had nothing else to
If day is fine, I said so save it cause
I do it on

[Hook]

Now listen to my song
If you ever ... out, how I feel about you now, baby
Just listen to my song

[Verse 3]
See I think we all got it twisted
I got everything but there's something missing
Until I found you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you boy, you, you, you, you, you, you
I do it on

[Hook]

[Outro]
Boy listen to my song (3x)
