Here's a little something about my ex
She thought she was a super freak
She thought the sex was incredible
Until she met me
I done her around the clock, 20-11 times a week
If you under 18 mom and dads put your kids to sleep
She couldn't wait to lick it
And I couldn't wait to stick it
And every time I break it
It would take a whole day to fix it
She said listen to me baby I know one day you gon' up and leave
She know I'm a Virgo and I'm impossible to please
Look into my eyes turned around got on her knees
She says I know you a cheater, but boy before you leave

Fuck my brains out, baby
Fuck my brains out, baby
Fuck my brains out, baby
Fuck my brains out, baby
Fuck my brains out, baby
She screaming "Love me baby"
Fuck my brains out, baby

Here's a little something about my ex
She thought she was a super freak
Until I slept that little body and left her laying in the sheets
I got her talking with my tongue
'Til she couldn't speak
The sweet to her sugar low, she feeling weak
She says let's shoot video pictures
So she don't forget it
Then she started crying
Looked right in the camera, her mascara was running
Said baby what's the matter
She said listen to me baby I know one day you gon' up and leave
She know I'm a Virgo and I'm impossible to please
Looked into my eyes turned around got on her knees
She said I know you a cheater, but boy before you leave

Fuck my brains out, baby
Fuck my brains out, baby
Fuck my brains out, baby
Fuck my brains out, baby

And girl I know I know I know you used to love me baby
I know I know I know I know you care
I know I know I know I know you want it baby
Just say the word, I promise I'll be right there
She said take my lonely heart, do me
One more time for the road
I'll always miss that kiss, a lover's delight
She said take my lonely heart do me
One more time before the road
I'll always miss that kiss, a lover's delight
