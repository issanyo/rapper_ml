[Intro: The-Dream]
Hello? Hello? Hello...
Is there anybody up here?
Hello?
Welcome...2085. Twenty eighty-five it is
Just me up here I guess

[Verse 1: The-Dream]
The magic of the moment snuck up on me
And caught me by surprise
Roamin' and I'm lonely
But I'm only
There's somethin in your eyes
And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be
(Whatever it might be)
Just keep holdin' on to me

[Hook]
Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin' you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
There's something you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
And I know that it's true
Baby you got me walkin' on the moon

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Don't keep me waitin', I'm impatient
C'mon to my runway, lets take off and fly
Now I'm where I wanna be
Come co-pilot with me
Lets burn up the sky

And I know it's not just the song
(And I know it's not just the song)
And I know it's not just the drink
(And I know it's not the drink)
But whatever it might be
(Whatever it might be)
Just keep holdin on to me


[Hook]
Cause I'll pull down a cloud for you
I'll circle the stars and bring you one back
I'll walk through the sun for you
Cause there's somethin' you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
There's something you do
That got me walkin' on the moon
And I know that it's true
Baby you got me walkin' on the moon

[Bridge: The-Dream]
Everyone out there will know that you are my girl
And my love will circle around and round
No matter what I do

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
Aye aye Dream I'm too good at this
Uhh, uhh, uhh, I can't contain it
No, no, no I can't restrain it
There's a lot of stars in here ain't it?
But you shine so much they don't seem famous
Where'd you come from on this lonely night?
I swear God must have made lightning strike
And I bottled it up
You hit the red carpet and modeled it up
We hopped in the 'rari and throttled it up
Now everybody clappin', they bravoed it up
All just because it's more than a buzz
More than a drink, but I took a few sips
And let it do what it does
Now drunk textin'
Like its all about you
Like I can't spend another minute without you
You know the drinks let you say things you ain't allowed to
Things that you fear, but you're way to proud to
Say out loud
Cause niggas gonna clown you
Put your Blackberry down
People is around you
I'll put my mack berry down
I ain't tryin to hound you
Just tryin' to take you where the stars gonna surround you
And Uhmm, maybe ice down you
And Uhmm, maybe white gown you
And Uhmm, maybe we should talk about all this after I pound you
Ha, you know I'm just playin' with you
I know a lot of people mad cause they ain't with you
Wait is it because we on the moon
Tell 'em to save the hate we'll be home soon

[The-Dream]
There's something you do
That got me walkin on the moon
Uhh, and I know that its true
Baby, you got me walkin on the moon
Everyone out there will know that you are my girl
