This is when everybody get on the flo' and then we rock
This is when everybody get on the flo' and then we rock

Putting overtime, celebrating our love
I'mma party all night, demonstrate my love
I'm gettin' my Diana Ross on
I'm hot
You got my heart on lock

Baby, love
Giving the prom hoes bad times
To live and I came for you (?)
Ready for all the best times
That I will have with you

I wish it could feel like this, celebration
I wish it could feel like this, exhilaration
I wish it could feel like this, joy
I wish it could feel like this when it's stack in the mornin' in love
When the world is coming down
You're the spark of my life and you're not my?
I wish it could feel like this sensation
I wish it could feel like this elated
I wish it could feel like this stop hatin'
I wish it could feel like this what it's like in the moment of love

If the whole world falls apart
I will be your son
Still embraced between your heart
This is when everybody killin' the flo' and then we rock
This is when everybody killin' the flo' and then we rock

I hypnotize when I describe, woo, your love
Someday I feel alive, that's when I realize it's your love
I'm gettin' my Diana Ross on
I'm hot
I'm coming out
You got my heart on lock, you're showing off

Baby, love
Giving the prom hoes bad times
To live and I came for you (?)
Ready for all the best times
That I will have with you

I wish it could feel like this, celebration
I wish it could feel like this, exhilaration
I wish it could feel like this, joy
I wish it could feel like this when it's stack in the mornin' in love
When the world is coming down
You're the spark of my life and you're not my?
I wish it could feel like this sensation
I wish it could feel like this elated
I wish it could feel like this stop hatin'
I wish it could feel like this what it's like in the moment of love

If the whole world falls apart
I will be your son
Still embraced between your heart
This is when everybody get on the flo' and then we rock
This is when everybody get on the flo' and then we rock
Hmmm, that love
Baby, that love
