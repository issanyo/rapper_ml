[Chorus]
Girl you know I'm crazy for you
Never felt this kinda love, baby
That’s why I'm tryna put this baby in you
Is it me, or am I just faded?
No-oh-oh
Me or just faded?
Ooh-ooh
Is it me, or am I just faded, faded?
Am I just faded, faded?
Am I just faded?
Is it me, or am I just faded?

[Post-Chorus]
Turn the lights off
Let's paint our pictures on the bedroom walls
Again and again and again and again a
And we won’t stop until your body falls

[Verse]
Lil' shorty, I got it for you, lil' shorty
Lil' shorty, I wanna get it from you, lil' shorty
Lil' shorty, I just want us to
And it appears that you want it, too
Me and you
Just us two
Oh

[Chorus]
Girl you know I'm crazy for you
Never felt this kinda love, baby
That's why I’m tryna put this baby in you
Is it me, or am I just faded?
No-oh-oh
Me or just faded?
Ooh-ooh
Is it me, or am I just faded?
Faded, faded?
Just faded, faded?
Am I just faded, faded?
Just faded, faded?
Is it me, or am I just faded?

[Post-Chorus]
Turn the lights off
Let’s paint our pictures on the bedroom walls
Again and again and again and again, ahh
And we won't stop until your body falls

[Chorus]
Girl you know I’m crazy for you
Never felt this kinda love, baby
That's why I'm tryna put this baby in you
Is it me, or am I just faded?
No-oh-oh
Me or just faded?
Ooh-ooh
Is it me, or am I just faded?
Am I just faded, faded?
Am I just faded, faded?
Am I just faded, faded?
Is it me, or am I just faded?
