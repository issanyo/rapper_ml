[Hook: The-Dream]
I got 200 thousand dollars in my earlobe
Damn all them, ain't shit change
They ain't never seen this much gold on a negro
Triple gold thing, 24 inch blades
We know, said that you would never be my equal
Now you having conversations with my ego
Trap money, rap money, now this shit legal
You can keep acting but it won't be a sequel
F U, pay me, F U, pay me
F U, pay me, F U, pay me
F U, pay me, F U, pay me
F U, pay me, F U, pay me
I'm sitting on the floor, high fiving in the locker room
We sitting fresh in the courtroom, my niggas'll be home soon
All of my niggas'll be home soon
Told you my nigga will be home soon

[Verse 1: Jermaine Dupri & Da Brat]
And I'm keeping her close by
Yes we be the most fly
To you ever seen
Mean smoother than the Ghost ride
Only fear the most high
Fuck your blog post
I got my middle finger up, I'm high
And I'm like boy, bye
Tell 'em boy, bye
Tell 'em boy, bye
Middle finger up, I'm high
And I'm like boy, bye
I don't eat off the same menu, I want it fresh as it get
You can't do nothing but continue when you blast like this
200 thousand in my earlobe, nigga fuck your wrist
And the windows automatic, dream me in my sets
Bruh, bruh, your lil sister done grown up
Showed out when I showed up
And never keep leaning on your shoulder
Cause I'm home now and I'm zeroed up

And I'm keeping 'em close to me
Ain't nothing a sticker won't do for me
Nobody come close to breaking the bond
Them niggas that try, them niggas is gone
I'm sorry, we invisible over here
You niggas is pitiful over there
We ain't cut from the same ambilical
But we cut from the same cloth that's So So Def
Balling since the 90's
Small cheques all behind me
Way these niggas sound when they rap now
This shit is so timely
And beat it like the graffiti
You see me, I'm on your TV
It's all for you niggas to be me
Believe me, I'm greedy
But needy? I'm not
I earned what I'm eating
I appreciate everything that I got
And if a nigga try to run up and take away
He won't see the sun come up another day
My trigger finger itchy
Hit my demeanour bitchy, fucks with me
