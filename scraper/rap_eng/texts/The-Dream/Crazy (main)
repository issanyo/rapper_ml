Boy I know you're a bit unsure
So I wanna let you know, that you got me
Baby, I'm all yours
Gotta have you around
Don't wanna do without you here
If you still don't get the picture

I'm crazy bout you, and I gotta have you. (Crazy)
'cause I like the way you
Make me feel (Boy I like the way ya.)
I'm crazy bout you (crazy bout you)
And I gotta have you (gotta have you)
And I like the way you make me feel
Boy for real

Can't wait to be alone with you
Hearts racing when you look at me
Baby, if I could
I wanna feel this way for good
You don't know just what you do to me
Baby, I got to be

I'm crazy bout you, and I gotta have you. (Crazy)
'cause I like the way you make me feel
(Boy I like the way ya.)
I'm crazy bout you (crazy bout you)
And I gotta have you (gotta have you)
And I like the way you make me feel
Boy for real

Aww...I hope you really understand
Can't make it to hard for you to
That we...uhh..huh..be together
(boy) before I let you go

Loon:
Aww.....yea..check it out
I'm young Markess A.K.A Hollomnight
Good morning ma, heard you had a love life
You look so good, pretty in the sun shine
Girls you a gold mine, being a wife and the whole nine
You captive my mind first time I met you
And lords knows I ain't got time to sweat you
You look crazy in that new Mercedes
And I can't act like it don't phase me
Because I try to fight it
Try to conceal it; hide it
Girl I can't deny it
I'm just a fool for your love
Cool of the club
I just wanna move smooth
Like I'm crushin on duggs
I'm a grown man
I get to choose who I love
Choose who I hug
Choose who I usually rub
For other chicks I don't usually buzz
Girl you wanna know the reason why I choose your love
Because you drive me crazy, (you drive me crazy, and I gotta have you)
Cause you make me crazy. (Aww..I like the way you make me crazzzzzzzzy)

I'm crazy bout you, and I gotta have you. (Crazy)
'cause I like the way you make me feel
(Boy I like the way ya.)
I'm crazy bout you (crazy bout you)
And I gotta have you (gotta have you)
And I like the way you make me feel
Boy for real

Loon:

Dream:
I'm crazy bout you, and I gotta have you. (Crazy)

You make me feel
