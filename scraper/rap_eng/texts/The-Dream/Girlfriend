We could be, whatever baby x 2
I just wanna rock with you all night
Baby I’ll ride with you till I die
I’ll give it all up for you,Voilà
And every bad boy needs a girl to hold her down
Ooooh
Be no other
Let me be your only lover
I’ll be the one; I’ll be the one for you
Ooooh

I’ll be the one; I’ll be the one for you
You oh

Hook

I’m just trying to keep it real x 2
Tell you how I feel, tell you how it is
I ain’t no shit?
No pill popping
But we can light this love up blunt spark it
Batman, Robin
We mobbing
Michelle Obama, even after we leave office

Ooooh
Be no other
Let me be your only lover
I’ll be the one; I’ll be the one for you
Ooooh

Intelligible

I’ll be the one; I’ll be the one for you
You oh
Hook



Bridge
Boy I need you
They won’t
I’ll see
They don’t
I’ll be there
Whenever
You know they won’t
I love your way
I love your face
Your kiss
Your touch
You mean so much


Hook
