[Verse 1]
I ain’t even wanna say it (say it, say it)
I ain’t tryna to blow your head up (head up)
Tryna to find a way to play it off
But I don’t wanna wake up

I keep dreaming of you
But not enough to hit snooze
But it’s not the world without you
Don’t wanna say but it’s true

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me acting like a girl
You got me all in my feelings
You make me lose it til I’ve lost it
When usually I be bossing

You got me acting like a girl
But not so much that I ain’t me
But just enough that I can see
It’s no I in team

[Chorus]
I knew it
It’s just another fuckin love song
We’re just another fuckin love song
I’m gon break your spirit
You gon break my soul
All this summer love goes cold
Just another love song
All good til it’s gone

[Verse 2]
Now it’s like you never knew me
Act like you don’t know me
You used to hold me, the old me
Console me, show me  what your love is made of
Now there’s all this space between us
Brooklyn, Decatur

Now you the left fade us
I’m on the right, this ain’t us
Why we can’t just, and can’t adjust I knew it

[Chorus]
We just another fuckin love song
Just another fuckin love song
You gon break my spirit
I’m got break your soul
All that summer love turns cold
Just another love song
All good til it’s gone (gone, gone)

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh)
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Just another motherfuckin love song
Just another fuckin love song, love song, 
Oh no, oh

Oh oooh oh oh oooh oh oh
Yeah, baby, yeah
