Tears tear down the walls
Far, far
Blood seeps through the floor
We both fall far

And all is gone as I say no, yes
And the rainbow's flooded
Suddenly floating
All I know, I'm standing in this room without you

Gone
Gone

Wish I could fly away
Back to the place where we used to love
I wish I
I wish I could fly away
Back to that place where we found love

Where have we gone?
Where have we gone?
Where have we gone?

The Basquiats fall off the comet
The winter's getting colder, no sun
So much ice in me
Breathe

And all is gone as I say no, yes
And the rainbow's flooded
Suddenly floating
All I know, I'm standing in this room without you

I wish I could fly away
Back to that place where
I wish I could fly away
Back to that place where I used to love you

Love is gone
Love is gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
Gone
