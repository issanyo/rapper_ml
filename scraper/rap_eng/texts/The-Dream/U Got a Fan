[Verse 1]
Girl, you got a fan, uh
You so mothafuckin' fancy
And your jewelry look like candy
Tryna turn them legs into Bambi
Girl, you got me feelin' randy
Fuck the Plan B
I'll take care of you
Like soul food

[Chorus]
Girl, you got a fan
With that drip game on you
You so motherfuckin' fancy
Tryna do ya 'til them legs go Bambi
Call me Michael Myers, come through lookin' for the candy
Girl, you got a fan
Yup, I call her "Drip Game Shorty"
You so motherfuckin' fancy
Tryna love ya 'til them legs go Bambi
Call me Michael Myers, come through lookin' for the candy

[Verse 2]
Girl, you got a fan
You so motherfuckin' fancy
I need your body on the beach
Come and meet me in Miami
You smell rich as fuck
I swear I'm not just tryna fuck
You what we call "Black Girl Magic"
Drive a Rolls Royce truck with an ass that stop traffic

[Chorus]
Girl, you got a fan
With that drip game on you
You so motherfuckin' fancy
Tryna do ya 'til them legs go Bambi
Call me Michael Myers, come through lookin' for the candy
Girl, you got a fan
Yup, I call her "Drip Game Shorty"
You so motherfuckin' fancy
Tryna love ya 'til them legs go Bambi
Call me Michael Myers, come through lookin' for the candy

Girl, you got a fan
Let's make a plan
She finally full, finally full and nasty
I'm tryna come, tryna come, catch me
Shaniqua Williams
Fresh out the Carolinas
Girl, your body
Shot out to Raleigh

[Chorus]
Girl, you got a fan
With that drip game on you
You so motherfuckin' fancy
Tryna do ya 'til them legs go Bambi
Call me Michael Myers, come through lookin' for the candy
Girl, you got a fan
Yup, I call her "Drip Game Shorty"
You so motherfuckin' fancy
Tryna love ya 'til them legs go Bambi
Call me Michael Myers, come through lookin' for the candy

[Outro]
Girl, you got a fan
Girl, you got a fan
