[Verse 1: The Dream]
Promise me you'll make me better
Promise me you're there for me
Can you love me for what I am
And love me for what I can be
Say you're nothing like them other girls
Girl you're nothing like them other girls
And for that I'll cry for you
And for that I'll die for you

[Hook: The Dream]
Where have you been
I'm all fucked up now
It's all fucked up now
And I'm all destroyed
Where have You been
I needed you then
Where were you then, it's all your fault
Where have you been
But I'm glad you're here now
Hold me right now, shit, I'm so lost
Where have you been
You took your time, I'm glad you're in my life
Now make this right
Where have you been

[Verse 2: Kelly Rowland]
Now that we're together
I can curse you out, and ask you what took you so long
Now that we're together
First I wanna say I love you
And secondly what kinda shit you've been on
You mess around with them other girls
Knowing damn well they got nothing on me
I'm messing around with them guys
Knowing damn well got nothing on you
But I'm glad that the sun finally shined my way
Ever since you came around I ain't been the same
Saved my life, and I owe it to ya baby

[Hook: Kelly Rowland]
Where have you been
I'm all fucked up now
It's all fucked up now
I'm so destroyed
Where have you been
I needed you then
And where were you then, it's all your fault
Where have you been
You almost lost me
I almost lost you
Tell me what to do
Where have you been
All my life, here's your chance to make it right
Where have you been

[Bridge: The Dream]
Just when I thought my life was over
God sent you right my way
I needed a super woman to save me from this place
Found it inevitable
That I would never find love
Now that I found true love
I'm never giving it up

[Hook: The Dream & Kelly Rowland]
Where have you been
I'm all fucked up now
It's all fucked up now
And I'm all destroyed
Where have you been
I needed you then
Where were you then, it's all your fault
Where have you been
I'm glad I found you
Tell me what to do, it's all your fault
Where have you been
Oh baby, baby, baby (Make this right)

Where, baby, where, baby where...
