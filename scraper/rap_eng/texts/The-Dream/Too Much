[Verse 1]
I admit I miss seeing your face, babe (seeing your face, baby)
And being alone is starting to take its toll
I'm cold and it's getting old (getting cold)
I admit (I admit) I should have made some changes (changes)
We were so smothered in love
We didn't have a chance to come up for air (No fair)

[Pre-Chorus]
What a waste, where did the time go?
Where did our minds go? I don't know
What's this place? Where did our home go?
We won't know, I don't knowâ€¦

[Chorus]
Too much of anything is too much
Too much love can be too much
We had too much time, too much us
So we fought like tomorrow was promised
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much,  much much too much

[Verse 2]
I admit I'm still watching the days go by
And sleeping alone is starting to break me down
It's cold, but I should have known
I admit I made a few mistakes, babe
We were so caught up in love
We didn't have a chance to come up for air (No fair)

[Pre-Chorus]
What a waste, where does the time go?
Where did our minds go? I don't know
What's this place? Where did my heart go?
We'll never know, I'll never know...

[Chorus]
Too much of anything is too much
Too much love can be too much
We had too much time, too much us
So we fought like tomorrow was promised
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much,  much much too much

[Bridge]
I need to find a reason to feel
Like everything was meant to be let go
Take it slow, 'cause I can't be on my own

[Chorus]
Too much of anything is too much (it's just too much)
Too much love can be too much (it's just too)
We had too much time, too much us
So we fought like tomorrow was promised
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much, too much
Too much, too much, too much,  much much too much
