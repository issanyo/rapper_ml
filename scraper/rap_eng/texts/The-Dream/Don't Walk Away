Wooaaah, ooooh

Her voice, I can still hear it all in my head
I can still hear the way that she said
When she said she's leaving
Oh her tears I can still feel them on to my head
I can still see her from where I stand
In her pain I'm drowning
But I, only have myself to blame
Don't tell me that it's to late
I think about you night and day

Yes I hurt you, I know yeah I made my mistakes
Next time I won't let pride in the way
I will stand by your side and I'll stand till it's right
There's no way it should end this way
Just don't walk away

You're on the other side of town
I wonder what you're thinking now
Never meant to break you down
I'm sorry now
One more day without you by my side
I swear it's gonna make me die
I need you to turn around
Oh baby

Yes I hurt you, I know yeah I made my mistakes
Next time I won't let pride in the way
I will stand by your side and I'll stand till it's right
There's no way it should end this way
Just don't walk away

Just don't walk away
Just don't walk away
Oooh don't walk away girl
Go nowhere

Every morning when I arise it's a nightmare
Cause baby you're not there
No loving when I get home
I'm tired of praying alone
Baby please come back I know

Yeah I hurt you I know yes I made my mistakes
Next time I won't let pride in the way
I will stand by your side and I'll stand till it's right
There's no way it should end this way
Just don't walk away

Yes I hurt you, I know yeah I made my mistakes
Next time I won't let pride in the way
I will stand by your side and I'll stand till it's right
There's no way it should end this way
Just don't walk away

Just don't walk away baby
Oooooh
