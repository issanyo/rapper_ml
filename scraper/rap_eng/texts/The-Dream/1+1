[Verse 1]
If I ain't got nothing, I got you
If I ain't got something, I don't give a damn
'Cause I got it with you
I don't know much about algebra, but I know 1+1 equals 2
And it's me and you
That's all we'll have when the world is through

[Chorus 1]
'Cause baby, we ain't got nothing without love
Darling, you got enough for the both of us
So come on, baby, make love to me

[Post-Chorus 1]
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Right now, baby, make love to me
We, me, me, me
Oh, make love to me

[Verse 2]
Hey, I don't know much about guns, but I
I've been shot by you, hey
And I don't know when I'm gon' die, but I hope
That I'm gon' die by you, hey
I don't know much about fighting, but I
I know I will fight for you, hey
Just when I ball up my fist, I realize
I'm laying right next to you

[Chorus 2]
Baby, we ain't got nothing but love
And darling, you got enough for the both of us
Ooh, make love to me

[Post-Chorus 2]
When my days look low
Pull me in close and don't let me go, make love to me
So when the world's at war, let our love heal us all
Help me let down my guard
Make love to me, me, me, me, me
Oh, oh, make love to me, me, me, me, me
