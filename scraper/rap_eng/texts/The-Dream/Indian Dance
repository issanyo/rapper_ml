Step in the club head low with the lights down
Made my way to the floor fellas gather round
Step My hips out there make em point and step
Feel the heat that beats in the atmosphere

Just my chest feel the sweat get into it now
I get the feeling we gonna party till they shut it down
People watching from the bar pretty tipsy now
Break it down ladies roll it like a gipsy now

Went in My A, all the way to Jamaica
From New york back across to the bay now
I see you watching and i know you wanna get in me
Boy I have you singing like them indians

Oh halhalhalhalhaYaaa
Boy I have you singing like them indians
Oh halhalhalhalhaYaaa
Boy I have you singing like them indians
Oh halhalhalhalhaYaaa
I have you singing like them indians
Oh halhalhalhalhaYaaa

Ohohohohohoooo... ohohohohohoo
Aho-aho hohohohohoo.. mo-ohohohohohohohooo

Feel the kick in the drums make you move
Hands in the air dont be scared let it groove (mamas)
But my body won't stop put you in a trance
Try to keep up with me if you can

Shake Ya Body body, Move your Body body
Dont hurt nobody body, keep this party Poppin'
Soo whats the kick on my girls let em see you drop
I put me back to the top and make you hot

Went in My A, all the way to Jamaica
From New york back across to the bay now
I see you watching and i know you wanna get in me
Boy I have you singing like them indians

Oh halhalhalhalhaYaaa
Boy I have you singing like them indians
Oh halhalhalhalhaYaaa
Boy I have you singing like them indians
Oh halhalhalhalhaYaaa
I have you singing like them indians
Oh halhalhalhalhaYaaa
