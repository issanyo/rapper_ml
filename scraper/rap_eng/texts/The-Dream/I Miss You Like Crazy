[Intro]
I miss you like crazy
Tell me when you're comin back home
I miss you like crazy
Tell me when you're comin back home

[Verse 1]
Since u've been away
Things ain't been the same
I miss you more and more each day
Sumthin 'bout your love
I just can't get enough
I wish it wouldn't hurt so much

You don't know what you done to me
I can't sleep at night baby
Wishin you were here with me
There's sumthin 'bout the love you give
No one else can give it to me
I miss you like crazy

[Chorus]
I miss you like crazy
I miss you being my baby
Tell me when you're comin back home
I miss you like crazy
I miss you being my baby
Tell me when you're comin back home

[VERSE 2]
No matter what I do
I can't stop thinkin of you
You're always on my mind
My heart is not a home
Since you've been gone
I wish you would come back to me
You dont know what you've done to me
I can't sleep at night baby
Wishin you were here with me
There's sumthin' bout the love you give
No one else can give it to me
I miss you like crazy

[Chorus]

[BRIDGE]
Now I realized how much you mean to me
You are my everythin
I miss you baby

[Chorus]
