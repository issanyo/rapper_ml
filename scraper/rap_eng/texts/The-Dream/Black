[Hook]
I feel real black right now
Real black right now
I feel real black right now
Real black right now
I feel real black right now

[Verse 1]
I never knew you like I should've known you
But my father spoke of you through that liquor
Can we get a curtain call?
Let us pray your idea outlives you
Cause everywhere there's a Chicago
The only way we're getting out of here is if we hit the lotto
My mama left the incense burning on the dresser
A hard way to learn one lesson
She said never be impressed with a man with no message

[Hook]
I feel real black right now
Real black right now
I feel real black right now
I feel real black right now
Real black right now
I feel real black right now


[Bridge]
And I'll never be Mr. Madiba
I'm gonna thank you the next time I see you
You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now...

[Verse 2]
The oppression of a young Malcolm
And shots rang out across the balcony the day we lost a dream
To young to sing Marvin Gaye's "What's Going On"
Since then ain't been a lot going on
Enough pain can make a whole race bitter
They say the right amount of love can heal us
Reminiscing back when Hilfiger made us feel like niggas
And that's the kind of thing that sticks with you
I never felt this black...

[Hook + Bridge]
I never felt this black
I feel real black right now
Real black right now
I feel real black right now
I feel real black right now
And I'll never be Mr. Madiba
I'm gonna thank you the next time I see you
You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now...

[Outro]
Somebody take us home
Take me home
Let's go home
Let's go home
You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now...
You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now...
You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now...
You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now...
Somebody take us home
Real black right now...
Real black right now...
You got me feeling real black right now
Real black right now...
