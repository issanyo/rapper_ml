I got a Basquiat hanging in my kitchen
I could do a hundred-yard dish in my living room, oh

My first daughter remind me of Rudy
But her father's not a doctor
Straight off of that blocka
Where them boys used to move that white
Strapped up with them yoppers

But we sticking to the script
Even though we changing up the scene
We see you plotting
