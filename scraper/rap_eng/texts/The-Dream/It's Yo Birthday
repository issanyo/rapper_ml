[Intro]
Oh, dreams, oh

[Chorus]
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
And we gon’ start at 8, you better not be late
And we gon’ celebrate, I get the first taste
And we gon’ end this party in your favorite place
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
And we gon’ start at 8, you better not be late
And we gon’ celebrate, I get the first taste
And we gon’ end this party in your favorite place

[Verse 1]
Ima put a bow on that box for you
I’m on the clock, on the clock for you
Ain’t got no dimes, but I got a rock for you
Just tell me where you want me sit it at
I’ma give you this gift, but you gotta give it back
I’ma cut up that cake for you
Anna Mae my face for you
Whatever you want, that’s what we’ll do
Surprise party, starting right here in the living room

[Chorus]
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
And we gon’ start at 8, you better not be late
And we gon’ celebrate, I get the first taste
And we gon’ end this party in your favorite place
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
And we gon’ start at 8, you better not be late
And we gon’ celebrate, I get the first taste
And we gon’ end this party in your favorite place

[Verse 2]
Make a wish for me, put on this for me
Turn this bitch up to a thousand degrees
Suck up the ice, and you’re so enticing
I’ma knock that shit out like a ‘89 version of Mike Tyson
Listen to me, I come bearing gifts
From your lips to your hips
Now open up, open up for me, open up for me

[Chorus]
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
And we gon’ start at 8, you better not be late
And we gon’ celebrate, I get the first taste
And we gon’ end this party in your favorite place
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
And we gon’ start at 8, you better not be late
And we gon’ celebrate, I get the first taste
And we gon’ end this party in your favorite place

[Bridge]
I just wanna rock with you
Unwrap your love, and give me you
I just wanna bask in your light
'Cause it’s your birthday, its yo birthday
And I just wanna make you feel right

[Chorus]
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
And we gon’ start at 8, you better not be late
And we gon’ celebrate, I get the first taste
And we gon’ end this party in your favorite place
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
And we gon’ start at 8, you better not be late
And we gon’ celebrate, I get the first taste
And we gon’ end this party in your favorite place

[Outro]
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
It’s yo birthday, it’s yo birthday
