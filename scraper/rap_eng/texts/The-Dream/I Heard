[Ostenato: The-Dream]
Something real
Heard
Heard you cryin'
Heard

[Pre-Chorus: Vory and (The-Dream)]
Hey, hey (Heard you cryin')
You don't take time to listen to my side (Heard)
Just know when he's gone I'll be by your side (Heard you cryin')
Last night you called and I can hear you cry (Heard)
Hung up my phone, I was on your side
Hey, hey, hey

[Ostenato: The-Dream and (Vory)]
Heard you sighin'
Heard (hey)
Heard you lyin' (hey, why why why why?)
Heard (oh, why why why?)

[Pre-Chorus: Vory and (The-Dream)]
Hey (Heard you cryin')
You don't take time to listen to my side (Heard)
Just know when he's gone I'll be by your side (Heard you cryin')
Last night you called and I can hear you cry (Heard you sighin')
I ask myself why, then I ask you why

[Chorus: The-Dream]
And still I wait up, I stay up, I wake up
I pray about you
I know I fucked up don't know face in this cup
Can't live without you
But he lies like I lied but my lies were sweeter
He lies 'cause he want you
And I lie 'cause I need you

[Pre-Chorus: Vory and (The-Dream)]
You don't take time to listen to my side
(Heard) Just know when he's gone I'll be by your side
(Heard you cryin') Last night you called and I could hear you cry
(Heard) Asking myself why and then I asked you why?
Oh why, why, why? (Oh why, why why why)
(Heard you sighin') And my heart it hurts baby (oh)
(Heard) Lately we've been at war lately
(Oh, why, why, why?)
Just know I hurt
Don't care what I heard
Don't care what I heard

[Chorus: The-Dream]
And still I wait up, I stay up, I wake up
I pray about you
I know I fucked up don't know face in this cup
Can't live without you
But he lies like I lied but my lies were sweeter
He lies 'cause he want you
And I lie 'cause I need you

[Bridge: The-Dream and Vory]
There's no doubling down
And take your head out the clouds
'Cause the sun lay on your face
Until those beautiful eyes rain
I hurt, oh I hurt, know I hurt
Just know I hurt you, just know I heard you, yeah
Just know I heard you, I'm not here to hurt you

[Chorus: The-Dream]
And still I wait up, I stay up, I wake up
I pray about you
I know I fucked up don't know face in this cup
Can't live without you
But he lies like I lied but my lies were sweeter
He lies 'cause he want you
And I lie 'cause I need you
