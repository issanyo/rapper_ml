[Plies]
It's Plies baby, let me go tuck 'em in
My bay just called me and told me to cum put her to sleep
She said her period just went off, feel like she in heat
I been feinding for her, I couldn't touch her all week
I told her to get naked and be waiting on top of the sheets
I wanted her so bad when I've seen her I didn't have time to speak
I told her on my shoulders is where I wanna see her feet
I put a pillow behind the headboard so it wouldn't squeak
And put her hands around my waist and told her push me deep
I told her I'm gonna work with her all night until she on
I can feel her nails in my back that's how I know I'm beating
I put my ear to mouth I love to hear her breathing
I can tell she almost at her peek by the way she's screaming
I feel her wetness on my stomach and I'm the reason
She's clutching the sheets and running I'm tryna keep her even
Whispered in her ear if you don't nut I ain't leaving
She went from moaning to shaking and now she's sleeping

[Hook:]
I wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
I'm gonna put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'm gonna rock your body
Turn you over
Love is war
I'm your soldier
Touching you like it's our first time
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed
I'mma put you to bed, bed, bed

[Verse 1:]
Girl, change into that Victoria Secret thing that I like
Alright
OK, tonight you're having me your way
Perfume, spray it there
Put our love in the air
Now put me right next to you
Finna raise the temp in the room
First rub my back like you do
Right there, uh-uh, right there uh
You touch me like you care
Now stop
And let me repay you for the week that you've been through
Working that 9-5 and staying cute, like you do
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Hook:]
I love it (I love it)
You love it (you love it)
Everytime (everytime)
We're touching (we're touching)
I want it (I want it)
You want it (you want it)
I'll see you (see you)
In the morning (in the morning)

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm staring at you while you sleep
Irreplaceable beauty
Put my face up in your neck and breathe (aww, breathe)
Take you into my senses
Wake up, it's time to finish
Round two, it's round two
Matter of fact it's closer to three
She's like, "how long I been sleep?"
Shorty, kisses turn into the sweetest things
Like give it to me
And I can feel her tell me

My angel this is wonderful
Thanks, for letting me bless you
Come down, fly, right, drift back into heaven
Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh

[Pre-Hook]

[Bridge:]
Watch the sunlight peak over the horizon
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
The sun ain't the only thing that's shining
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Now, I'mma send you out into the world with my love
Tell everybody aye, everybody aye, aye [x10]
