[Intro]
Let's do this
God of War
God of War

[Verse 1]
These old tears are just liquid years
Of rivers filled with minimal joy
And this little pain, no gain, just rain
I strain to pull myself out of your hurt until today

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so glad, you're going away
I'm sorry and sad to say

[Chorus]
Tears of joy
Tears of joy
I'm so glad you're gone
You're so fucking annoying
You just don't know
I'm so excited you're gone
No more fighting back and forth
God of War

[Verse 2]
I'm not fair, I don't care
I can't wait for you to walk out of my door
Cause this ain't life
Ain't right under your knife, can't cut my love anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so glad, you're going away
I'm sorry and sad to say

[Chorus]
Tears of joy
Tears of joy
I'm so glad you're gone
You're so fucking annoying
You just don't know
I'm so excited you're gone
No more fighting back and forth
God of War

[Bridge]
One day you'll wanna worship
The ground I walk on
We love the things that are long gone
One day I wanna replay
The days it could have went right
But you made them so wrong
Sealing our fates in the melodies of song

[Outro]
God of War
God of War
