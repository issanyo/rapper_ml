[Pre-Chorus 1]
We can split it 50-50 if you think that'll make it last
But just don't pay me back for all them niggas that made you mad
I don't need it, I don't need it, I just want your love instead
We can't buy back this moment, and I ain't tryna die alone
Yeah
Six, six, six, six, six, Sextape Volume 1
One

[Verse]
The more I'm off up in that, the more I miss it
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
It's like I got everything that I could have
But I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shawty I ain't even faded, I'm elated
When I'm around you, I feel the greatest
I need a centerfold, I need your soft body
We don't need nobody here, we're our own party

[Chorus]
Beautiful cars, pretty planes
Everybody know my name, by the way, fuck the fame
I just need your cherry on top (Top)
Right now I need that cherry on top (Top)
I just need that cherry
Fuck this Patek, fuck this Audemars
Rather spend that time sexin' you
The world is ours
Now I need that cherry on top
I just need that cherry on top
Now I just need your cherry on top
Top (Top), Top (Top), Top (Top)
(Yeah, eh)
Top (Top), Top (Top), Top (Top)
(Eh)
I just need that cherry on top
Top (Top), Top (Top), Top (Top)
(Yeah, eh)
Top (Top), Top (Top), Top (Top)
Now I just need your cherry on top

[Bridge]
Girl you know I need you (Oh, I need you girl)
So bring that pretty thing, oh let me make sure, oh (Whoo!)
And I'm just what you needed
A real nigga with some sensitivity that ain't insecure, ooh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We can split it 50-50 if you think that'll make it last
But just don't pay me back for all them niggas that made you mad
I don't need it, I don't need it, I just want your love instead
We can't buy back this moment, and I ain't tryna die alone

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shawty I ain't even faded, I'm elated
When I'm around you, I feel the greatest
I need a centerfold, I need your soft body
We don't need nobody here, we're our own party

[Chorus]
Beautiful cars, pretty planes
Everybody know my name, by the way, fuck the fame
I just need your cherry on top
Right now I need that cherry on top
I just need that cherry
Fuck this Patek, fuck this Audemars
Rather spend that time sexin' you
The world is ours
Now I need that cherry on top
I just need that cherry on top
Now I just need your cherry on top
Top, top, top

Top, top, top (Eh)
I just need that cherry on top
Top, top, top
