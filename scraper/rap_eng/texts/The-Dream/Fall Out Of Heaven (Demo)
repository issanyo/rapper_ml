[Intro: The-Dream + Kanye West]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Uh uhh
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
Fall back in the pussy like swoosh, swoosh, woosh
Ballin' money woos, woos, woos
Y'all niggas got jokes, hot jokes Bruce, Bruce, Bruce
Dog, I'm about to get loose, loose, loose
All night tryna dutty wine
Woke up my dick crooked as the Nike sign
Pop's when you had me on
I could [?] when you had me on

[Hook 1: The-Dream]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
She used to get dick from Kanye West
So if you ever see her give her Kanye's best
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
And I just can't seem to get that nigga broke
And I don't know how you get that nigga jokes but
[mumbling]
And if you ever don't than get at me, at me
[mumbling]
We be ballin' like the athletes
The shoes you were wearing were so last week

[Hook 1: The-Dream]
No one wants to fall out of heaven
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
No one wants to fall out of heaven

[Bridge: Bon Iver]
What are we chasing?
It feels like we're changing
(There's no proof)
Those on clouds
Learn to debate YAH
Ain't no love in the playground
(Now I'm speaking truly loud)
Go away!
Chained to the bounce now
Ain't no love in the playground
(Waiting by your phone)
That's a long way

[Hook 2: The-Dream]
And as those sweet tears fall from the sky
This girl gon' hate me forever
Nothing that I can do to unbreak your heart
I'm just doing my part
And I try my best not to bring it up
Just look the other way
Used to live in wonder
You were struck and now your love feels like thunder
Thunder
Thunder
Thunder

[Outro: Section 25 sample]
You can see through the veil
And forget all your cares
Throw them
Throw them away
