[Verse 1]
By way of London, Americana
The persona, it's primadonna
Kick a muthafucka to the cizzurb
You think you crazy, I'm berserk
I'm off the chain, you gotta love it
I can't express enough, how bad I want it
Baby one day, I wanna be there
Beyond the stars, like a zillionaire

[Bridge]
I brought my clique up in here
Put them diamonds in the air
You can hate this all you want
But we gon' take this everywhere
Don't pay them, no never mind
You're just a waste of time
Baby watching from the sideline

[Hook]
While I roc the li li li la la li li li, li li li la la li life
While I roc the li li li la la li li li, li li li la la li life
While I roc the life

[Verse 2]
I see the lights, see the money
Super glamorous
Fresh off the runway
Wanna be infamous, Notorious
As directed According to us
Whiskey nights, gettin' it in to tear
Blowing money fast, get it again
Baby one day I'll live there
Beyond the stars
Like a zillionaire

[Bridge + Hook (x2)]

[Verse 3]
Oh oh, we're gon' make this day last forever
Oh oh, I'll make this the night to remember
No surrender, no

[Verse 4 x2]
Write my name on stars
So you can see it
Wherever you are
Please believe it
I'mma take it all
Ain't gonna stop
Until I, (fall, fall fall, fall)

[Hook x2]
