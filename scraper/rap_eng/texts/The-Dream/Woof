[Chorus: The-Dream]
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
I do this for my bems, I got glaciers on my paws
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
I just do it, do it, I just do it, do it
Fendi down to the socks, I just do it, do it
I see them hatin' on the side, man I knew it, knew it
'Cause when they chick Mac slide, we just blew it, blew it
Yeah I see you gettin' money, I get twice that
Mad at me, Cardi B, I like it like at
I see you takin' your shots, I won't fight back
'Cause all that hatin' ain't gon' help you get your life back
Noble, noble, noble, noble, noble, noble
I started local now a nigga make it global
East Coast, West Coast, bicoastal
If you can't see me, better get your bifocals

[Chorus: The-Dream]
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
Got bright, yellow diamonds all the way down to my paw
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
My bitch fine as fuck, got matching panty bra
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
A little ice in this watch, this ain't a bust down
Diamonds dancing like Odell at the touchdown
Woof, woof, no roof on the coupe, coupe
How you see the zoo, [?]
Real money since '98, the throwback
They saying I'm a legend but I know that
They gettin' too high, they like a zombay
Bein' broke is they choice, I asked Kanye
LeFrak with the slime, that's my [?]
They got pride, they bonin' bitches with Hondas
It's really real when Citi Field was Shea Stadium
Fiends look for my work like vibranium

[Chorus: The-Dream]
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
Got bright, yellow diamonds all the way down to my paw
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs
My bitch fine as fuck, got matching panty bra
I do this for my bitches, I do this for my dawgs

- You know, what of the hardest in the world is for you to be a star? And then you go back to being regular
- Hm
- That's why when you see all these rappers going crazy, like I understand it, because...
-  Hm, yeah
- Do you understand how it is to go sell out millions of records, then you go on tour, millions, and that's three years strong, you had that, and then two years from that, there's somebody else that comes over and they take over, now they not their mans, like you got to be a strong individual to sit there, like I'll tell you the truth, if a rapper doesn't have a record out or isn't, uh active, they're going through something
- It's like post-traumatic stress
- It's is, it's one hundred percent like that because it's like it's addiciting too, it's like yo, when you get something, like when you're the man on Monday, it's hard not to be the man on Wednesday
