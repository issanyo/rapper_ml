You know like I know
You ain't never ever met nobody like me
You know like I know
You ain't never ever met nobody like me

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team
You never met a girl like me

I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team

I might wake you up in the morning and cook for you
If you having problem with a song
I'll write a hook for you
11:30 at night
I ain't gonna look for you
Look
You

Cause I know you're coming home with me
I will never stress you
Or make you feel misled
If you wanna go to the movies
I'll flip it instead

You don't pay me
I get this with my bread, my bread
'Cause you know
My money ain't a thang, a thang
You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team

If you trying to be out to the party
I'll let you go
If you want be out with
Somebody that's when I show
You do as you please
'Cause baby, that's how you know that

There's no other place that I'd rather go
I ain't trying to be fussing and fighting
Up on your back
Anytime you need me
You know that I'm getting your back
Ain't no one like me
I want you to know that

Know that I ain't changing nothing
'Cause it's like that, like that
I know you're used to lovers that treat you like your mother
So I know it's hard to understand
When I say I'm your girl
But I'm like your man

No matter if it's sweet talk or street talk
I'm right here by your side
And soon you'll come to see
How it is to be down with a chick like me

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team

[Jermaine Dupri]
You ain't never gotta worry about me shaking the spot
Or even think about another chick takin' ya spot
I love it when you come around shutting
Shot down

Lookin' good stating
My SUV
You know how long I been waiting
For someone with they mind right
Find they like to kick it with this homey in the limelight
Don't play
Uh, uh
Keep a ***** havin' fun
All she ever think about is me

Christina, I ain't never seen nobody do it like you
That's why I'm out here tryin' to give the whole world to you
No matter what it is I gotta get it
Hers and his 'cause baby, you're the girl of my dreams

At first, I didn't understand what I was dealing with
A real really fly
Relationship
I was killing it
But now I never felt nothing like I'm feeling?
This. And all I ever talk about is getting?
That ring

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team

You never met a girl like me
I ain't gonna sweat other places you be
Who you run with who you having fun with
That's how it is
When you got a down little chick on ya team
