[Intro]
I remember the last time I saw you
Blue
I remember the last time you called my name
Blue

[Verse 1]
Took my mind, yeah you took my mind
I don't know where the time went
I lost my mind, then I lost my mind
I need time to find it
Hard to climb, so hard to climb
In this kind of climate

[Verse 2]
All I had was you
And all you had was me
And all we had was a dream of intention
Playing with my life, that's the price to feel alive

[Hook]
And I'd do anything
Just to live on your level
And I'd give anything
Just to love on your level
