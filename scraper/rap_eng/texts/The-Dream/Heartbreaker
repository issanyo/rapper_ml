[Verse 1]
Never thought that I would live to find another love like mine
Time
Never thought that I could be in a place to ever see it
See it fly high

[Chorus]
I need that heartbreaker
I need something to lose
I need that breathtaker
When it's gone, it leaves a bruise
Break my heart
Break my heart, yeah
Break my heart, ooh
Give it to me good
Break my heart

[Verse 2]
I wanna wake up in the morning
Appear you've moved on like a stone
In the middle of the night
I see you missing from my arms
Where have you gone?
Look what you've done
So I sit up in this bed and I imagine where you're at
All this playing games with love, I think this time I've met my match
What have I done?
Where have you gone?
See I love it when you take that part of me
It's intoxicating, I can barely breathe
Yes, I love you when you do these things to me
See, baby, see

[Chorus]
I need that heartbreaker
I need someone to lose
I need that breathtaker
When you're gone, it leaves a bruise
I need that heartbreaker
I need something to lose
I need that breathtaker
When it's gone, it leaves a bruise
Break my heart
Break my heart, yeah
Break my heart, oh
Give it to me good
Break my heart

[Bridge]
What is love? What is love? (...)
What is love?
It's up in the air
It's neither here nor there
Spare me the time to explain it
I just know how it feels
Too much of it can kill
When not enough of it is real
Just enough of it can heal

[Chorus]
I need that heartbreaker
I need someone to lose
I need that breathtaker
When you're gone, it leaves a bruise
(Come on and) break my heart
Break my heart, yeah
Break my heart
Give it to me good
Break my heart

[Outro]
Break my heart
Break my heart
Ooh, show me that it's real
Yeah, I love how it feels
