[Hook]
I hate to have to crash your wedding with this shit
Let me sing you my drunk song
I hate to have to crash your wedding, but here it is
Let me sing you my anthem
I hate to have to crash your wedding, with this shit
Let me sing you my drunk song
I hate to have to crash your wedding, (my anthem) but here it is

[Verse 1]
I'mma be missing you forever
We still should be together
I'm already on my 3rd ring
These bitches ain't even on your level
(And you know) I tried to replace you
With my ex, and the ex before that
Had me all miserable
When you left, everything went left
Still got some of your things
If you want, I'll send them to you
I'd rather send you my love
Even though I know it's past due
See, it's going on eight years
Baptizing in my tequila tears
All the lights off, I'm all alone
Just me and this bottle of Patron

[Hook]
Singing you my drunk song
I hate to have to crash your wedding, with this shit
This my motherfucking anthem
I hate to have to crash your wedding, with this shit
Oh baby this my drunk song
I hate to have to crash your wedding
It's what I sing when you're not around
Baby it's my anthem, my anthem
I hate to have to crash your wedding

[Verse 2]
All you wanted was my heart and soul
And I was walking around so cold
And now, every girl I try to replace you with
Is just a name on a pay roll; you get it?
Shawty, you the shit
And it's nice to see you hop up out that new 6, congratulations
I know you're looking forward to your wedding day
It's been so long, damn, shit's changed
She's just another girl on the blog
She can never compare to how beautiful you are
See, you're right, I'm wrong, so long, I'm gone
Just me and my bottle of Patron

[Hook]
Singing this drunk song
I hate to have to crash your wedding, with this shit
This my motherfucking anthem
I hate to have to crash your wedding, but here it is
Baby this my drunk song
I hate to have to crash your wedding, with this shit
This my motherfucking anthem, my anthem, a-a-anthem, anthem
I hate to have to crash your wedding, but here it is, yeah

[Bridge]
Yeah, I know you're probably not thinking 'bout me
Yeah, but I'm here thinking 'bout you
Yeah, know it might be a little late
To admit that I was just afraid
Cause now I'm on the low train
And I hope I get off, 'cause I'm sure the next stop is cocaine
Or some other drug
Right now, my heart's all numb
Bet you're wondering where it's all coming from

[Hook + Outro]
Oh! Baby this my drunk song
I hate to have to crash your wedding, with this shit
This my motherfucking anthem
I hate to have to crash your wedding, but here it is
Oh baby this my drunk song
It's what I sing when you're not around
Motherfucking anthem, anthem, ohhh (oh!)
(Baby this my drunk song) And I'm just shakin' my head, my head, my head
(My anthem) Must admit, baby, I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared
(Drunk song) And I'm just shakin' my head, my head, my head
(My anthem) Admit that I'm scared, I'm scared, I'm scared

[Outro]
I'm lost without you (nigga sing that shit)
I've been lost without you (nigga sing that shit)
I'm lost without you (nigga sing that shit)
I've been lost without you (nigga sing that shit)
(Nigga sing that shit)
It's just me and this bottle of Patr√≥n (nigga sing that shit)
You, I won't forget (nigga sing that shit)

[Hook/Outro]
I hate to have to crash your wedding, with this shit
(Drunk song) I hate to have to crash your wedding, but here it is
