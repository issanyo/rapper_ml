[Chorus]
Fat ass, thick thighs
Smoked out in my ride
Long hair, pretty eyes
Smoked out in my ride
Sippin' on this syrup
Like Pimp C still alive

A hundred years ago
I'm sure I had a girl that looked just like you
A hundred centuries ago
I was destined to end up with someone like you

So when I tell you drop it drop it drop it drop it
When I tell you drop it, drop it drop it
When I tell you drop that down
Shawty drop that ass for a real nigga
Baby don't stop it stop it stop it stop
Don't stop it stop stop it
Don't you stop that shit now

[Chorus]
Cartier frames
Light up this weed
Pour out some pink for a nigga
Roll up again for a nigga

From Atlanta but it feel like Houston
Bass in the trunk bumpin' shit you ain't used to
Girl lookin at me like she really wanna do somethin'
Girl in the club lookin ya finna lose somethin'
My niggas in the club sippin on that screw
Call it back-to-back like oohh

Playa I'm a pimp
Eatin lobster and shrimp
This money in my pocket just exaggerate my limp
Throw some rims on the car
Bitch I'm a star
Diamonds in my teeth
And everywhere we are
Fur coat on
Pimp C season
And if you ain't pimpin'
Fuck nigga you just breathin'

[Chorus]

Pinky full of diamonds
Hundred thousand dolla watches
Put my time in watchin' niggas nigga-watchin' [?]
My girl named Booty
Got ass like Atlanta
I love how she talk
Thank her grandma for the grammar
Ain't been the same since I threw them Voz on the 'llac
Leather in the guts
15s in the back
Step up in the club
Gucci on the head
You did that for 3
Whatchu gon' do for a stack?

I'm from Atlanta but this feels like Houston...

[Chorus]
