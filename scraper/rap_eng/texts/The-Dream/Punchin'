Ey ey [x9]

[Verse 1:]
You want me to be the last chick (you'll ever have)
But I ain’t like the last chick (you ever had)
Smooth like butter
Simple, real soft
Coming over nothing
I'm letting you get off

You're tryna be the last dude (I’ll ever have)
Better talk to the last dude (was not so bad)
Cause I love ya
I love ya

I'll hug ya
I'll hug ya
We can keep it fine
But don't you cross the line (or I'll be)

[Chorus:]
Punchin' you in your sleep
Wake up
Hurting, screaming
It wasn't me

I know you think that
I've been washing your clothes
But I’ve been putting
Dirty clothes back in your drawers

Don’t make me sick
Don't make me cry
Don’t make me sick
Or I'll get wild

And I'll get wild
And I'll wanna fight
And I’ll have your ass
Up for the whole night

Don't make me...

[Repeat 4x]
Na Na
Na
Na Na
Na Na
Na (You don't wanna go there)

[Verse 2:]
With that smirk on your face (you better like him back)
And it might be the last laugh (you'll ever have)
And the worst is I'm thinking
You thinking that it's nothing

When it's love
I be bugging
You're lucky I'm only cussing
I swear
I'll be last chick (that you get mad)
I side to the one short time (burning back)

I wanna love
Wanna love you
Wanna hug you
Wanna hug you
Everything is fine
But don't you cross the line

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge repeat x2:]
I need a guy, that I can
Come on
The one that bring
Dat dat dat
Dat beers home

And hold it down
That will hold me right
And will just hold me tiiiight [x2]

[Repeat Chorus:]

(You don't wanna go there)
