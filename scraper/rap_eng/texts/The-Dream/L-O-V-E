[Verse 1]
Oh, I hope this don’t turn serious
But baby when you come around
I can’t seem to let those eyes go
Maybe I’m just curious
Cuz I ain’t ever been here before, no

[Pre-Chorus]
I ain’t that girl
No, no not me
I watch them fall
They watch me leave
And I have never worn my heart on my sleeve
But now love’s looking at me, oh no

[Chorus]
Why if it ain’t love, I just can’t let you go
And why does it feel like my heart’s about to implode
And I put that on everything
It never meant much to me
Being in L-O-V-E

[Post-Chorus]
Ride with you, I’ll ride with you, die with you
If anything go down, baby, I’m gon’ side with you
For life, for life with you
Can’t you see I wanna hold you down
Oh, baby, I’m high with you
On high, I’m high for the first time in my life with you
It never meant much to me
Being in L-O-V-E

[Verse 2]
You know, lovin' make' em talk
Facing your neck, hands on my waistline
You can see it in the wall
I'm facing affection even in the nightime
You can see it in the doll
It started with a spark, now it's everywhere that we are
Dont want to be, this could happen to me

[Chorus]
Why if it ain’t love, I just can’t let you go
And why does it feel like my heart’s about to implode
And I put that on everything
It never meant much to me
Being in L-O-V-E

[Post-Chorus]
Ride with you, I’ll ride with you, die with you
If anything go down, baby, I’m gon’ side with you
For life, for life with you
Can’t you see I wanna hold you down
Oh, baby, I’m high with you
On high, I’m high for the first time in my life with you
It never meant much to me
Being in L-O-V-E

Ride with you, I’ll ride with you, die with you
If anything go down, baby, I’m gon’ side with you
For life, for life with you
Can’t you see I wanna hold you down
Oh, baby, I’m high with you
On high, I’m high for the first time in my life with you
It never meant much to me
Being in L-O-V-E

Ride with you, I’ll ride with you, die with you
If anything go down, baby, I’m gon’ side with you
For life, for life with you
Can’t you see I wanna hold you down
Oh, baby, I’m high with you
On high, I’m high for the first time in my life with you
It never meant much to me
Being in L-O-V-E

[Outro]
Being in L-O-V-E
Being in L-O-V-E
(Can’t you see I wanna hold you down)
Being in L-O-V-E
