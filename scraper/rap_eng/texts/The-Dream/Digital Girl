[ Intro: The Dream]
Yeah, girl, you so sexy though
As she just lay at your feet

[ Verse 1: Kanye West]
I wanna see what's under there, there
Now put it in the air
Yeah, load it on my Macbook Air
It's a new form of macking, don't be old fashioned
Update your passion
Only reason why I be iChattin'
Is when it's time for some action
I wanna hit it way, way out like John Paxson
But for now I just gotta watch her practice
Send her a picture so she see it
She says, I-I-I can't believe it
Ohh, she all on me, on me
Ohh, I think she want me, want me
I think she showed her homies
Why? Cause all the homies on me
Ayo, all the digital gonna have to do for now
But I'mma break it down when I get back in town

[Verse 2: Jamie Foxx]
I love it, girl
The way you bring your light into this room
I love it, girl
The way your legs light up when they're in them shoes, oh
I love it, girl
The way your lips looks after you apply the gloss
I love you, girl, girl
You look right in the screen and take it off, off
See I can't wait till I get a little taste of you
And I just upgraded to 10-80i, hi def just for you

[Hook: Jamie Foxx]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl

[Verse 3: Jamie Foxx]
My homies never seen you
But I always got you right here for me
Tucked in my Louis computer bag
Wherever you are, I could be
I'll type you a message for the next send off
You shoot me a video and then I load
Even though I hate this distance it keeps me persistent
One day I'll have your ass up in this kitchen

[Hook: Jamie Foxx and The Dream]
My digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
She's my digital girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl, girl
My digital girl
Not a day goes by shawty
Without you on my mind, shawty
Hey, don't care what you wear
Baby, I wanna see what's under there

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
When you seen the picture cut off the face
Now cover up the tattoo by the waist
Let the MC search till I reach third base
And when I get home I'mma hit home plate
Wait, would this be considered our first date?
Yay, this picture just looks so trash
Your body make a baller spend cook coked cash
Plus every good girl wanna go bad
And pose in the mag like Stacy Dash
Or Kim Kardashian and be a lady addict
You know what's a crazy thing?
A girl would make you wait longer than AC Green
Passion of the Christ, thirty three year old virgin
That's disrespectful, baby, don't encourage him
I like them brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Persian
Dashiki, kimono, or turban
They say I dress white but my swag so urban
Tryin' my luck, I hit her with the text say
Baby, you up, question mark
And she reply YES-S-S-I-R

[Hook]
