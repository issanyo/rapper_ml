[Intro: The-Dream]
Shawty rock to the beat for yo boy
Shaw-ty, doooo it
Shawty rock to the beat for yo boy

[Fabolous overlaps intro]
Ay, it's Loso in case you ain't know so
Ay, Dream lemme tell you bout shawty..
(AYE)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Shawty is the sh-sh-sh-sh
Sugar honey iced tea
Prettiest one I see
Little mama icy
They say she a Pisces
I heard they are feisty...
You know how to treat her, she'll be sweeter than a Hi-C
Clean up very nicely, shoes a kinda pricey
Match 'em up precisely, good jeans nice tee...
Like her food spicy
And she is the same
Hotter than a flame, but I do not know her name...
Is it Keisha? (AYE)
Is it Tisha? (AYE)
Maybe Lisa? (AYE)
Or Teresa? (AYE)
Could it be Tia?(AYE)
Maybe Aaliyah? (AYE)

Now it's time I (ay), get back up

Oh yeah! We used to kick it up at the park
Now she's all grown up... (UP, UP, UP)
Rockin them stilettos
Jumpin' up out that Mercedes truck (TRUCK)

[Pre-Chorus]
It was Keisha (ohh-ooh), it was Sonia (ohh-ooh)
It was Tanya (ohh-ooh), it was Monique (ohh-ho)

[Verse 3: The-Dream]
Dior jeans, her walk so mean
Burberry fragrance on my shirt from when she hugged me
Hard as rock when she touched me
Thinkin' now if she would've loved me
What it is, what it ain't, tell me what to do (ay)
I know I'm late, but destiny bought me back to you (ay)
Time went by, turned you into a butterfly
I'm here to say, hello, tell yo nigga, good-bye...

[Pre-Chorus]
It was Keisha (ohh-ooh), it was Sonia (ohh-ooh)
It was Tanya (ohh-ooh), it was Monique (ohh-ho)
It was Niecy (ohh-ooh), it was Keke (ohh-ooh)
Ay, now that I see you at twenty-three, all I can say is...

[Bridge: The-Dream]
If she fine, if shawty a dime...
You should tip her... you should tip her...
If she go, and you love her...
You should tip her... you should tip her...
If she fix you eggs and grits in the morning...
Man you should tip her... you should tip her...
Pancakes with the bacon on the side
(You should tip me, you should tip me)
