[Verse 1:]
How can I love this bitch?
And at the same time scream and fuck this bitch
And at the same time while I fuck this bitch
And at the same time had enough of this bitch
How can I hold this bitch?
And at the same time I don't know this bitch
And at the same time I would cry over this bitch
And at the same time I would die over this bitch

[Pre-Hook:]
On Thursday I'll leave you all alone
On Friday you showing up in my songs
This Saturday we back on the phone
Last Sunday... welcome home

[Hook:]
I think she put that that New Orleans on me (got me feenin)
That that New Orleans on me (oh my baby)
I think she put that that New Orleans on me (and I can't say shit)
That New Orleans on me (just sit back and take it)
You know that spaghetti feeling in yo chest
Say I'll see ya when I see ya
But can't leave you cause I need you
That that New Orleans on me (it got me feenin)
That New Orleans on me (oh my baby)
You know, you know

[Verse 2:]
How can I curse this bitch?
And at the same time I lust over this bitch
At the same time while we fuss up in this bitch
And we don't match but we perfectly fit
How can I trust this bitch?
She's so mischievous
But it isn't it obvious?
A nigga stuck like Chuck up in this bitch
But for real

[Pre-Hook:]
On Thursday I'll leave you all alone
On Friday you showing up in my songs
By Saturday we back on the phone
It's Sunday... welcome home

[Hook:]
I think she put that that New Orleans on me (got me feening)
That that New Orleans on me (oh my baby)
I think she put that that New Orleans on me (and I can't say shit)
That New Orleans on me (just sit back and take it)
You know that spaghetti feeling in yo chest
Only see you when I see you
But I see ya cause I need ya
That that New Orleans on me (it got me feenin)
That New Orleans on me (oh my baby)
You know, you know

[Bridge:]
I wanna let her go and I wanna tell her no
But I don't wanna be like that, don't wanna be so bad
Don't wanna make her mad
All I know, something's going wrong
Still a nigga trying to hold on hold on hold on hold on
Still can't say so long
First she fine, now she in my face
Got a nigga feeling okay
Say she love me then that's where I've been
What the fuck you tryna say?
But, whenever I'm on the sides
Like she got me high
'Til she put me down, me down, me down
But you know what I'm talking 'bout

Put that that New Orleans on me (it got me feening)
That that New Orleans on me (oh my baby)
