[Intro]
How, how, how deep, deep, deep do you want it?
How, how, how deep?

[Verse 1]
Yeah, fuck, nigga
We don't ever ever check the time
I just sit back and let it grind
This is my shit, and she got her own shit
So we do it whenever, however
Wherever we motherfuckin' want it
From the sofa to the counter to the bed
Man, this shit go deep, uh
Outside, let it ride, and she ride that shit like Jeep

[Chorus]
She got that freak of the week, yep
She got that super soaker
She hide that freak underneath, yeah
You gotta get to know her
Now that we've had some time
Now that we've passed some time
Know what's been on your mind
Before we start to grind
How deep do you want it?
How deep? How deep?
Man, I'm finna do it for the culture
How deep do you want it?
How deep? How deep? Uh
Shawty, I'ma do you for the culture

[Verse 2]
You want it rough, nice and slow
The only time I hit a girl is from the back
And the only time I slap a bitch is on the ass, yeah
Let that body roll, yeah
All you gotta do is ask and I'll give it to you
Stop sittin' on that pussy, girl, give it to me
See, we up in the master, the roofs off this bitch
And we out in the Benz and the Coupes off this bitch
Now you up in the booth, told the booth off this bitch
Yeah yeah yeah
Up in my ear talkin' that shit
I'm like, "Girl, your pussy's the fattest, your body's the baddest"
And I been the baddest since my mama had me
But she never had me, she callin' me Daddy

[Chorus]
She got that freak of the week, yep
She got that super soaker
She hide that freak underneath, yeah
You gotta get to know her
Now that we've had some time
Now that we've passed some time
Know what's been on your mind

How deep? How deep?

[Intermission]
We gon' take a quick intermission right here
We'll drop the motherfuckin' kicks
The hi-hats and the snare

[Bridge]
She said she wasn't lookin' for a long time
Only for a good time, only for a good night
She just got a promotion
She just got a Tesla, she focused
But now she like, now she like
"Don't fuck nobody but my body, nobody," oh yeah
Don't fuck nobody but her body, nobody (Oh yeah)
Now she like, don't fuck nobody but her body
She means nobody, yeah

[Chorus]
She got that freak of the week, yep
She got that super soaker
She hide that freak underneath, yeah
You gotta get to know her
Now that we've had some time
Now that we've passed some time
Know what's been on your mind
Before we start to grind
