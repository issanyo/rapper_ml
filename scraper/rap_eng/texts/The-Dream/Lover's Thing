Wanna say come over, but I told you that it's over
How much pain can my heart take? Ohh yeah

[The-Dream:]
And well, I wish that you were closer
So I can love over, over again...
Today I may have lost my friend
(Girl...)

[Ciara and The-Dream:]
You, you are my baby
I can't just let you leave
I'm caught up in this lover's thing

[Ciara:]
It's love, and that I can't deny
Won't even start to lie
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
Baby you...

[The-Dream:]
Girl, take back your decision
And paint me back in your picture
I'm calling on your phone girl
You keep sending me straight to voicemail

[Ciara:]
Now why ain't he persistent
I'm sure by now he misses this
Calling on the phone, you won't answer my call

And you, you are my baby
I can't just let you leave
I'm caught up in this lover's thing

[The-Dream:]
Yeah, it's love, and that I can't deny
Won't even start to lie

Will you ever forgive me
Ooh Uhh
Hey love, are you there

And you, you are my baby
And I can't just let you leave
