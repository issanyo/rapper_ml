[Verse 1]
There are no pacts between lying and women
Why you insist on the change
My princess turned queen
Always asking for kings
Why do you love these things you can't tame?

[Hook]
You're so indulgeful
Kill us all
Broad day, before night falls
Your world's my colosseum
Kill them all
Isn't that what you asked for?

[Verse 2]
There are no pacts between lying and women
Keep throwing gas to the flame
My little princess chasing these princes
In love with things you can't tame

[Hook]
You're so indulgeful
Kill us all
Broad day, before night falls
Your world's my colosseum
Kill them all
Isn't that what you asked for?
