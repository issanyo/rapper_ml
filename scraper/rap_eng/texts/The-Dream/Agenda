Verse 1
I heard that you can make mascara run a mile
I heard that you got everybody going oooooh child
Well I’mma getcha for the next one
Getcha back for the ex that you did wrong
From New York down to Texas
Make you buy a Lex for your kids mom
I showed up with this agenda
Imma be the one that you remember
We met last September and I’ve been gone since November

Pre
I love you so much I wanna kill you
I love you so much I wanna be near you
Now I love you so much I wanna heal you
Now I love you so much I want the real you

Hook
But you all about them (Girls)
But you all about them (Girls)

All up on them (Girls)
On the phone with (Girls)
Never lonely (Girls)

Verse 2
Now I heard that you oh oh oh can nothing into something
Midnight magic, baby
Now I heard that you ou ou ou ou ou can turn zero into one zero
Instant classic baby

And all I’m thinking now is I should know your name
All I’m thinking now is I’mma make you remember remember my name
Say it over and over again, again, again, again
