[Intro]
I miss you
Oohh I miss you
I miss you
Nikki I miss you x4

[Verse 1]
It's been two whole years
One album later
Yeah I got your text
That read "Congratulations"
Heard you moved to Dallas
Hope you're doin' fine
Hope this LP didn't catch you at the wrong time
If I say I didn't miss you
Girl I would be lying
To you I never lied
Never would I try
And I always thought that you would end up on my side
But I ain't gon' repeat what I did last time

[Hook]
You showin' up, keep showin' up, keep showin' up where I'm at
Keep callin' me, keep callin' me, keep callin' me, come back
You fuckin' with, you fuckin' with, you fuckin' with my house
Me and my new girl was cool, but now I'm having doubts..

[Chorus]
And it's all because of Nikki
It's all because of Nikki
It's all because of Nikki
(It's all because of you)

[Verse 2]
Shawty we were the greatest
In the midst of all the haters
Then you switched it all up on me
You used to be my homie
You said you'd play the role
And then you went cold
This love we had that was new
Suddenly grew old
Girl, I thought you had my back
Why you treating me like this
Can't believe my side chick
Runnin' round talkin' shit
You said you understood me
Wondered what it could be
Use to say, "I love you"
Now I'm screamin', "Fuck you"

[Hook]
You showin' up, keep showin' up, keep showin' up where I'm at
Keep callin' me, keep callin' me, keep callin' me, come back
You fuckin' with, you fuckin' with, you fuckin' with my house
Me and my new girl was cool, but now I'm having doubts

[Chorus]
And it's all because of Nikki
It's all because of Nikki
It's all because of Nikki

[Bridge]
Girl, it's all because of you (hold up)
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
Even though I said we're through
