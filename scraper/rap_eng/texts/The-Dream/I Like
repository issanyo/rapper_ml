[Intro]
Yeah
Ooh, ooh
Yeah, radio killer
That late night nigga

[Chorus]
I like... the way she drop that ass like no tomorrow
I like... the way she in here tastin' like gelato
I like... the fact that she don’t do this shit for follows
I like... every mothafuckin' night, I fuck a model
She like... the Phantoms when they pull up to the opera
She like... standin' on the couches bustin’ open bottles
She like... the fact that I don't do this shit for follows
She like... the way we makin' love like no tomorrow

[Refrain]
She like... bein' on that tour bus
Sometimes it's the two of us, sometimes it's a few of us
Shawty, she like... (Ayy) fuckin' in that mansion
Holdin' dick for ransom, all of that and then some
Baby, we like... (Ayy)

[Verse 1]
She out of Heaven, but show up with a pitchfork (Yeah)
On the dick, off the dick, jump on the bitch like the pole vault
Her booty so soft, favorite rapper Rick Ross
On the left, Santa Claus, three words, take it off

[Chorus]
I like... the way she drop that ass like no tomorrow
I like... the way she in here tastin’ like gelato
I like... the fact that she don’t do this shit for follows
I like... every mothafuckin' night, I fuck a model
I like...
Wait for it
She like... the Phantoms when they pull up to the opera
She like... standin’ on the couches bustin' open bottles
She like... the fact that I don't do this shit for follows
She like... the way we makin' love like no tomorrow
She like...

[Verse 2]
All I wanna do is give you head, give you head
Every time I see you, want a sip, want a sip
Every time I see you, we ascend, we ascend
Straight up through the ceilin’, I'm just sayin', I'm just sayin'
Sex on the beach, shawty sand, shawty sand
"Don't you cum before me," she keep sayin', she keep sayin'
Girl, it's nothin' to a G, cum again, cum again
Just watch where you skeet, I'm just playin', I'm just playin'

[Refrain]
She like... bein' on that tour bus
Sometimes it's the two of us, sometimes it's a few of us
Shawty, she like... (Ayy) fuckin' in that mansion
Holdin' dick for ransom, all of that and then some
Shawty, she like...

[Verse 3]
The way I sweat her hair up (Way I sweat her hair up)
Forget 'bout all the shit she care about (Forget 'bout all the shit she care about)
We be puttin' hours in (We be puttin' hours in)
We be gettin' ours in

[Outro]
I like...
I like...
I like...
I like...
And she like...
She like...
Shawty, she like...
She like...
I'm the Odysseus
Nigga, I'm Odysseus
I'm the opus
I'm the greatest
I'm the GOAT-est
Opus
I'm the oldest
Nigga, I'm the greatest
I'm the GOAT-est
Bitch nigga, I'm the coldest
