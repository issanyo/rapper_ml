[Verse 1]
My little perfect thing
I wanna crash your fantasy
Woman, I wanna be that everything on your mind
Just love me endlessly, I swear I'll be whatever you need
Put me on the clock, promise I won't waste your time

[Bridge]
I know you think I'm just the same as them lil' niggas
Them lil' niggas, them bullshittas, them bullshittas
Baby, you too mean to be fuckin' with them lil' niggas
Yeah, I'm high as fuck and I'm drunk as fuck, but I'm here with you

[Hook]
And I wanna be yours
Just tell me, baby, you 'bout this, this ain't shit, I got this
Wanna be yours
Just tell me baby you want this and I'm on it, on it
I wanna be yours, baby
Fuck everything you heard, just say word, say word
I wanna be yours

[Verse 2]
Pussy niggas be hatin', fuck niggas be lyin'
Them bitches always talk shit, I leave them hoes every time
I'm just looking for that moment, that real love shit
That feeling that I felt when that first Outkast hit
Caught Southernplayali--nothing but strictly Cadillac pimpin'
That pimpin' I'm putting on all of these bitches
Except you, except you, you're too cool
I'ma be the one that never left you
If you was the girl that I never stepped to, that would be awful
Life of regrets, never disrespect
If you lovin' me baby, I'm lovin' you too
Three years later, tell your sister to come and pick up her nephew
Nephew
