[Hook: The-Dream]
I can give a fuck about the foreplay
I want it now
I'm talkin' straight sex
Stop fuckin' around
I can give a fuck about the foreplay
I want it now
I'm talkin' straight sex
Stop fuckin' around

[Verse 1: The-Dream]
None of these bitches ain't got nothin' on you honey
Body bumpin'
I'm just sayin', I'm all open on you
Oh, baby you all that, I don't know how to act
First call don't get ya, hang up and call back
I'm just sayin' I dont wanna lose a second with you
Cause baby

[Bridge: The-Dream]
You make me feel alive
You make me feel alive
Sweet as paradise
Baby you don't know how you make me feel
Can't wait to paralyze
I can't wait to get all you baby
Promise I won't waste your time
You know what I need so lets get straight to it

[Hook]
I can give a fuck about the foreplay (Oh baby)
I want it now (Oh sweet thang)
I'm talkin' straight sex (Hey shawty)
Stop fuckin' around (Oh baby)
I can give a fuck about the foreplay (Oh baby)
I want it now (Oh sweet thang)
I'm talkin' straight sex (Hey shawty)
Stop fuckin' around (Oh baby)

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Early morning, I'm so horny
I just had it, still I want it
Ride up on it whenever you come around
And I can't stop thinking what I'm gonna do
As soon as I set these eyes on you
And you know I'm not playin', listen to what I'm sayin'
Girl you dominate my thoughts
Cause baby

[Bridge]
You make me feel alive
You make me feel alive
Sweet as paradise
And I pray in my heart we will never be apart
Can't wait to paralyze
I can't wait lay on you
Promise I won't waste your time
You know what I need so lets get straight to it

[Hook]
I can give a fuck about the foreplay (Oh baby)
I want it now (Oh sweet thang)
I'm talkin' straight sex (Hey shawty)
Stop fuckin' around (Oh baby)
I can give a fuck about the foreplay (Oh baby)
I want it now (Oh sweet thang)
I'm talkin' straight sex (Hey shawty)
Stop fuckin' around (Oh baby)

[Bridge 2]
Now, work that shit, do that shit, make a nigga crazy
Do it out in public in the back of this Mercedez
I'll stop talkin' shit when you stop pro-procrastinatin', pro-procrastinatin'
Now, work that shit, do that shit, make a nigga crazy
Do it out in public in the back of this Mercedez
I'll stop talkin' shit when you stop pro-procrastinatin', pro-procrastinatin'

[Verse 3: The-Dream]
Don't tell me what you don't do, tell me what you gon' do
Tell me you gon' set it off all night
Every time she sees me she like, "Ooh boy you so freaky"
I'm like, "Ooh girl you so freaky"...aight
I don't deserve you, I know
But I'm gon' serve you, fo sho
I'm goin' half on a baby
Smoke in the air, faded
Half on a baby
Smoke in the air got a nigga faded
Bitch you got a nigga faded

[Bridge 2]
Now, work that shit, do that shit, make a nigga crazy
Do it out in public in the back of this Mercedez
I'll stop talkin' shit when you stop pro-procrastinatin', pro-procrastinatin'
Now, work that shit, do that shit, make a nigga crazy
Do it out in public in the back of this Mercedez
I'll stop talkin' shit when you stop pro-procrastinatin', pro-procrastinatin'
