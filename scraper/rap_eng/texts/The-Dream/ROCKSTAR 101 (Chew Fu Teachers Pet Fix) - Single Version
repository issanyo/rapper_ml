[Intro: Rihanna]
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck

[Refrain: Rihanna]
I-I-I-I told ya
I told ya baby
I told ya baby
(I don't really give a fuck)

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Got up in the club, posted in the back
Feeling so good, looking so bad
Rocking this skirt, rocking this club
Got my middle finger up, I don't really give a fuck
Rocking these diamonds, I'm rocking this chain
Make sure you get a picture, I'm rocking my fame

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby
Big cities (big cities)
Bright lights (bright lights)
Sleep all day (all day)
Long nights
Baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, it's big cities (big cities)
Bright lights (bright lights)
Sleep all day (all day)
Long nights
Baby, I'm a

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Hey, hey, hey

[Refrain: Rihanna]
I told ya baby
(I don't really give a fuck)

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Six-inch walker, big shit talker
I never play the victim, I'd rather be a stalker
So baby take me in, I'll disobey the law
Make sure you frisk me good
Check my panties and my bra
Wild'n out, a crazy house
With my white jacket on
Won't you come and sign me out?

[Pre-Chorus: Rihanna]
To be what you is you gotta be what you are
The only thing I'm missing is a black guitar

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby
Big cities (big cities)
Bright lights (bright lights)
Sleep all day (all day)
Long nights
Baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, I'm a rockstar
Hey baby, it's big cities (big cities)
Bright lights (bright lights)
Sleep all day (all day)
Long nights
Baby, I'm a

[Post-Chorus: Rihanna]
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro: Rihanna]
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Oh, baby, I'm a
Hey, hey, hey
