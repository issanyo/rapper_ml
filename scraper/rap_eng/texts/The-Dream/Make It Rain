[Chorus]
Girl, you know you PYT
Feel like your mama made you just for me
In and out, you're beautiful
I only talk the shit I know
And I only sing what I believe
The hardest things to do are the simple things
That's you and me, me and you, ayy
It's 12 o'clock, shawty, come through and
Make it rain
Make it rain

[Verse 1]
I know you get restless, I know you feel pressure
Every time you break up, you be second guessin'
I been here forever, tryna get your blessing
I been 'bout affection, you were 'bout perfection, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
No, never be no Carlton Banks (Girl), I know you know (I know)
And it's not what you want anyway, girl, I know you know
Yeah, you need that aggression, baby, you know I know
You need that obsession, baby, you know I know, yeah

[Chorus]
