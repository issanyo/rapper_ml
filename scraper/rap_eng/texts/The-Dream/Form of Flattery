[Verse 1]
I'm sorry I can't meet your approval, so please keep the hand-claps
No need for a compliment, I can pat myself on the back
No dying for an award, you can keep the trophy
I could really care less whether any of y'all mothafuckas know me
Excuse my French, pardon me, I don't mean to steal your shine
Man I'll be in the sun for so long, lookin my way'll just make you blind
All I need is the love, 'cause I can never have enough of that
You don't have to try to be the man, when you the man, see

[Chorus]
I'm embedded, and your fifteen minutes are almost up
Socialite, I wish you would roll up
(Ah me, oh yeah) Don't try me
I'm not like him, not like them, I wish you would roll up
(Ah me, oh yeah) I'm not him, I'm not like them
Don't try me, I'm not better than that
(No, oh)

[Post-Hook]
Form of flattery
You say he sound like me, you say they sound like me

[Verse 2]
I don't need another whip, a nigga flyin' now
I see you in the shadow, in my ocean without a paddle
Stop acting like a girlfriend, stop acting like a freshman
If you're surprised you're here, it means you shouldn't be here
No heart, no glory, no pain, no fear
It's one thing to be hot, but that don't make it a career, I'm

[Chorus]
I'm embedded, and your fifteen minutes are almost up
I wish you would roll up
(Ah me, oh yeah) Don't try me
I'm not like him, not like them, I wish you would roll up
(Ah me, oh yeah) I'm not him, I'm not like them
Don't try me, I'm not better than that
(No, oh)

[Outro]
But I appreciate the form of flattery (Tick, tock)
Oh, I appreciate the form of flattery (Tick, tock)
(Ah me, oh yeah)
(Ah me oh yeah)
(Whoa, ah-ah-ah)
Form of flattery
The form of flattery
There's no better than feeling than this, yeah-yeah
(Form of flattery) Form of flattery, oh
(Down, ah)
