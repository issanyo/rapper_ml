[Intro] (x2)
Work my body
Work my body
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus] (x2)
He's my friend lover
Lover like no other
He fills me up when I'm runnin' low on love

[Verse 1:]
I just take the phone
Dial him up, tell him what I what
Need a little of this
Need a little of that
From the front and the back

[Pre-Chorus]
He don't wanna talk about where I've been
I don't wanna talk about what he did
For me he'll leave his homies
Come over and put it on me
We don't wanna talk about what we do
It's just between us two
He's not my man all day, but all night he's my boo

[Chorus] (x2)
He's my friend lover
Lover like no other
He fills me up when I'm runnin' low on love


Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Friend Lover
(Friend Lover)
Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh

[Verse 2:]
I miss him when he's gone
Even though there's nothing set in stone
He could be my man, if I wanted him to
But until then I'll never break the rules
Rule 1: No poppin' up-up unannounced
Rule 2: Never leave your clothes at my house
Rule 3: Can't speak, if you see me when I'm out
Rule 4: You can't stay past 5, I gotta be at work by 9

[Pre-Chorus]
He don't wanna talk about where I've been
I don't wanna talk about what he did
For me he'll leave his homies
Come over and put it on me
We don't talk about what we do
It's just between us two
He's not my man all day, but all night he's my boo

[Chorus] (x2)
He's my friend lover
Lover like no other
He fills me up when I'm runnin' low on love

[Bridge]
Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Lover, Lover. Lover
Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh, Huh-uh

He don't wanna talk about where I've been
I don't wanna talk about what he did
For me he'll leave his homies
Come over and put it on me
We don't wanna talk about what we do
It's just between us two
He's not my man all day, but all night he's my boo

[Chorus]
