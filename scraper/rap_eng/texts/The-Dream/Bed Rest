[Intro: Sarah] (x2)
Baby I wish I could hold you
Promise I'll never let go of you
Baby you got me gone
Baby you got me gone

[Verse 1: Naomi]
I don't know why I'm still so sad and blue
And I don't know why I just can't get over you, ooh
'cause you did me no wrong, you didn't do me harm
You make sure I get all that I want I get all that I want
So I just don't know why I'm so sad and blue
When you give me all of you

[Chorus]
You got me on bed rest
I'm hurtin' for love
You got me on bed rest
It's like I'm givin' life up
Pillows and thoughts, not takin' no calls
No will, ever get up

You got me on bed rest
I'm hurtin' for love
I didn't get the respect that I deserved
It'll take time before I can find the will to get up
The will to get up

[Post-Chorus: Sarah]
I want the dark, could somebody cut the lights off?
Cut the lights on, tryna get a rise on
Gone like the sun 'til the morning
And I can't lie when the day goes by
I'm missing you
I'm so horny
Baby I wish I could hold you
Promise I'll never let go of ya
Baby you got me gone
Gone, gone, gone oh baby

[Verse 2: Naomi]
I don't know why my eyes don't open till noon
And even when they do they seem to close back at two
(I don't wanna get up I don't wanna get up no)
You got me gone, I'm so thrown
Every time you give me exactly what I want
So I don't know why I'm so sad and blue
When you always give me all of you

[Chorus]
You got me on bed rest
I'm hurtin' for love
You got me on bed rest
It's like I'm givin' life up
Pillows and thoughts not takin' no calls
Will never get up

You got me on bed rest
I'm hurtin' for love
I didn't get the respect that I deserve
It'll take time before I can find the will to get up
The will to get up

[Post-Chorus: Sarah]
I want the dark, could somebody cut the lights off?
Cut the lights on, tryna get a rise on gone like the sun 'til the morning
And I can't lie when the day goes by
I'm missing you
I'm so horny
Baby I wish I could hold you
Promise I'll never let go of ya
Baby you got me gone
Gone, gone, gone oh baby
