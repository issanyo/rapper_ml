Feels like love
Feels like lvoe
Hey yeah
Hey yeah

You got me spinning now
I feel your happiness all around
I'm not sure what I'm getting into
(Feels like love)
We're not the same everybody knows
That's the best thing about us though
So hard to believe it but it's true
(Feels like love)
See the world in different ways
But I'm lovin' every minute of every day
Against the odds we'll make it through

Maybe this could be
More than just fun
This could be everything
That I want
What's happening to me
Could you be the one
This could be everything
That I want
I didn't know how good it could be
And it feels like love to me

Feels like love
Feels like love
Hey yeah
Hey yeah

I didn't know I could feel this way
It's a new world baby that's OK
You're like the part of me I never knew
(Feels like love)
You're the one I need next to me
But I know that it's hard to be
Livin' for everybody else but you
(Feels like love)
Real love's not supposed to be
Afraid what everybody thinks
So let's show em all what we can do

Maybe this could be
More than just fun
This could be everything
That I want
What's happening to me
Could you be the one
This could be everything
That I want
I didn't know how good it could be
And it feels like love to me

I've got to say it now
(seems too hard to do this)
We've got to work it out
(Nothin' about us makes sense)
I feel the bridge
From where I am to where you are
It shouldn't have to be this hard

Maybe this could be
More than just fun
This could be everything
That I want
What's happening to me
Could you be the one
This could be everything
That I want
I didn't know how good it could be
And it feels like love to me

Feels like love
Feels like love
Feels like love to me
Feels like love
Feels like love
Feels like love to me
