[Intro]
Say I'm fucked up
Well, you might be fucked up too
I might be fucked up - well baby girl
How about you?

[Verse 1]
You used to be my nigga, you used to be that cool bitch
You used to smoke with a nigga, but now you on that bullshit
You used to sex me crazy, you used to call me "baby"
Now all you do is nag me, like a 5 year old from the backseat
You used to be so confident but all that shit done came and went
Used to be anti-internet, but now you constantly blogging n' shit
You used to strip for a nigga
Now you ain't got nothing but lip for a nigga
Halfway decent for me, but you dress up for your girlfriends
Listening to what they say got your ass without a husband
Put you in a Benz, you did everything to get me
Ain't done nothing since but keep talking about what it should be
Car note, daycare, paid all the fucking rent
Know you want to run the world, but first, try running this
But y'all don't hear me

[Hook]
Stop fucking with me, woman
Stop fucking with me if you ain't fucking with me

[Verse 2]
You used to be so sweet, but now you act all bitter
Just so I don't hear that shit, I drown my liver in this liquor
You used to be like this, man, you used to be my best friend
Now all you do is judge me, and scream out "fuck me!"
"But don't fuck me! Oh Hell to the no!"
Now I'm all up in the clubs, now I'm all up in the mall
Now you in my cell phone, screaming, "Who's this bitch?"
"She's just a friend," yeah, that's it
And now you want to trip, ain't that some shit?
Yesterday, you didn't give a fuck, now you asking where I been
And you hating on every girl who walks by
Talking about, "Where she think she going in that outfit?"
She don't even love me, she loves the competition
Every man out there: I hope you're listening
Can I be honest? Can I be motherfucking honest?

[Hook]
Stop fucking with me, woman
Stop fucking with me, if you ain't fucking with me

[Outro]
There's nothing at home, so I'm searching for love
Tried to get through, but you don't give a fuck
She can't love me, when she doesn't love herself
Feel like I'm sleepin with somebody else
I'm seeing somebody else, I'm touching somebody else
Now I'm fuckin somebody else
But go ahead and blame me if it helps
