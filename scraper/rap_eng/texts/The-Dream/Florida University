[Verse 1]
Used to Love ya (shawty)
You used to love me (shawty)
And then you left (shawty)
Quit thinking of me (shawty)
You want me back (shawty)
I can't do that (shawty)
Get some Patron (shawty)
This night gon' be long (shawty)
I picked you up
Never put you down
We were good together
We looked so hood together
And now you hate me
Lately
What rhyme wit ass hole
ASS HOLE!

[Bridge]:
I was the realest thing you've ever known
I couldn't wait to say I told you so
So forget you ever heard of me
This is short for Florida University

[Chorus]
[F.U., F.U., F.U., F.U., F.U., F.U., F.U
Florida University
F.U., F.U., F.U., F.U., F.U., F.U., F.U
Florida University

[Verse 2]
Acting crazy, you all crunk
Still got them pictures you sent me when you were drunk
Its heart break, I know but calm down
An why you still cursing me out on your Twitter account?
And why you tripping fo'?
Don't you got a man?
You a little off, I hope he understands
"I'm sorry we can work it out"
"I'm sorry, you aren't in my plan"
Then again, guess what finger I'm holding up on my hand
I was the realest thing you've ever known
I couldn't wait to say I told you so
So forget you ever heard of me
This is short for Florida University, (Oh yeah)

[Verse 3]
I hope this song is cutting like glass, girl
This ain't a compliment, you was a bad girl
You tried to break my heart but it backfired
I'm rolling on them 24's you flat tire

[Bridge]
I was the realest thing you've ever known
I couldn't wait to say I told you so
So forget you ever heard of me
This is short for Flo- Uni- Versity!, (Oh yeah)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now, now, now
Now what, what now?
Now what, what now?
Now what, what now?
Now what, what now?
