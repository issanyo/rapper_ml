[Verse 1: J4yDiZz1e]

I get that cash that's just me
You niggas mad that I'm clean
I run up on the freshest beat and then ya'll niggas hate me?

I Drink the hate and I drink a litter
I chomp Rappers I'm the rapping eater
Gotta go and praise the lord Jesus like everyday is Easter

I'm Drizzy two call it Back to Back
Ya'll Oldies be like New is Whack
I rap so clean it's enough to give your whole squad a heart attack
Come, Back to back to back to back
I'm getting it in cause her ass is fat
Sorry doc but I'm a have to yeet your check up cause here's a fact

[Bridge: J4yDiZz1e]
It's all about that gas, Light it up then pass, Pipe it up then stab
Find a basic bitch, fuck her in the ass
I don't give a fuck, smoke the shit and dab
Maybe smoke a blunt, think about the past
Fuck it back to start its all about the gas


[Hook: J4yDiZz1e]

You is a Hoe (x4)

Hoes they get down on the floor
You versus me you're a hoe

Fuck your shit I'm on the road
I get on beats niggas choke


[Verse 2: J4yDiZz1e]

The paper is my major, I get her wet I bathe her

I'm in the game, pass me the ball, run it up, then swish a fader

I go hard every time I rap, I go Eazy-E cause I'm in the trap

I sink my pain by having a bad bitch sit in my lap

Sorry momma I'm on the road, I make music that's the way I go

I fuck bitches, earn money, count it up, and I do this all alone

Got beat makers that are working with me, got magic singers call'em britney, britney

Life is hard, shit is hard, might have to get the money 50-50

[Bridge: J4yDiZz1e]
It's all about that gas, Light it up then pass, Pipe it up then stab
Find a basic bitch, fuck her in the ass
I don't give a fuck, smoke the shit and dab
Maybe smoke a blunt, think about the past
Fuck it back to start its all about the gas
