[Chorus]
Runaway sex, yeah
And me and you together, ain't no comin' back, back
All night long, we been on the road
Hopin' 'til the break, we don't ever close
Runaway sex, that's the rear view
We don't ever have to go back
It's like that, yeah, it's like that
Runaway sex, run it right back, yeah

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm not the same when you're gone, and it shows
And you're not the same when I'm gone, and I know
How it feels to be without that love day and night, baby
So let's be what we wanna be, ooh
Two strangers with common energy, ooh
Take it out slow, I'll take it out slow at first
Now take the next left, uh

[Chorus]
Runaway sex, yeah
And me and you together, ain't no comin' back, back
All night long, we been on the road
Hopin' 'til the break, we don't ever close
Runaway sex, that's the rear view
We don't ever have to go back
It's like that, yeah, it's like that
Runaway sex, run it right back, yeah

[Verse 2]
Our destiny, oh, is whatever we want it to be, uh
I believe in the most beautiful but simplest things
You and me
Hold my hand and let me take you off, uh, mmm
Let's find the sun, go and get lost, oh

[Chorus]
Runaway sex, yeah
And me and you together, ain't no comin' back, back
All night long, we been on the road
Hopin' 'til the break, we don't ever close
Runaway sex, that's the rear view
We don't ever have to go back
It's like that, yeah, it's like that
Runaway sex, run it right back, yeah

[Verse 3]
Me and you together, baby, who knows?
But if you got me, you know the world's yours
I swear I feel the same, baby, stay close
All we need is hush at the front door
Champagne kisses on your lips
And fuck what they say, we the shit
And fuck they life when we this lit

[Chorus]
Runaway sex, yeah
And me and you together, ain't no comin' back, back
All night long, we been on the road
Hopin' 'til the break, we don't ever close
Runaway sex, that's the rear view
We don't ever have to go back
It's like that, yeah, it's like that
Runaway sex, run it right back, yeah
