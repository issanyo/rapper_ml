[Verse 1]
Scratched up my whip bout three or four times
Broke up my sh*t bout three or four times
Got back with her bout three or four times
Ooohohhhh
Every two weeks she call the police
Every two weeks your boy gotta leave
And in two weeks shes back with me
Ooohohhhh
She's an angel, flippin saint girl
But I love her (?) (YEAH)
Kinda twisted but I miss it, been this way for a while (YEAH)
Ass so fat girl, it's a fact girl, and I love that smile (YEAH)
I can't tame it, can't explain it and I don't know why

[Chorus]
Tell me why oh why, why do I feel this way
It must the man in me, I can't let her leave
Tell me why oh why, it doesn't have to be this way
It must the man in me, cause I can't let her leave

[Verse 2]
Everything I say, she think that I'm lyin
Hang up and call back 25 times
And she'll leave a message 25 times
[Female voice:] Hello are you there?
Ooohohhhh
Everybody thinks that I'm crazay
Even though this girl drives me crazay
She'll always be my babay
I don't know how to let her go

[Chorus]
Tell me why oh why, why do I feel this way
It must the man in me, I can't let her leave
Tell me why oh why, it doesn't have to be this way
It must the man in me, cause I can't let her leave
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh Shawtay
Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh, Eh Shawtay

[Verse 3]
Why I can't just let it be
Something's got a hold on me
Just when I get it up to leave
See I can't live with her, and live without her
See there's something about her

[Chorus x2]
Tell me why oh why, why do I feel this way
It must the man in me, I can't let her leave
Tell me why oh why, it doesn't have to be this way
It must the man in me, cause I can't let her leave
