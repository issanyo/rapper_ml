And no matter how many things I have
No one will ever love me your way
No matter what love invades my space
One things for sure
You won't be replaced
Oh oh oh oh singing

If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
I guess I gotta make the sun cry
If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
I guess I gotta make the sun cry
It hurts me just to see your name
And that tattoo runs right through my veins
My sister misses you the same
And it hurts me cause I know she just can't say it
And what I would give to see your face yea
Where ever you are I pray your safe yea
Forgive me for my selfish ways yea
For I know that you're better off these days yea
Baby I miss you every time it rains
And no matter how bright the sun may shine
It never dries away the pain
Singing oh oh oh oh
Singing oh oh oh oh

And you're written all over me
So much so I can't believe
Your grandchildren are a sight to see
Every day there more of you and less of me
And what a clich√© I know you're here
No fear I know you're near

And no matter how manny things I have
No one will ever love me your way
And no matter what love invades my space
One things for sure
You won't be replaced
Baby I miss you every time it rains
And no matter how bright the sun may shine
It will nerver dry away this pain
And I'm singing oh oh oh oh
And I'm singing oh oh oh oh

If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
I guess I gotta make the sun cry
If you can't see the tears running down my eyes
Shit I guess I gotta make the sun cry
Oh yea oh yea...
Oh yea oh yea...
Oh yea oh yea...

Momma I miss you every time it rains
No matter how bright the sun may shine
It will never dry away this pain
And I'm singing oh
And I'm singing oh oh oh oh
And I'm singing oh
And I'm singing oh oh oh
