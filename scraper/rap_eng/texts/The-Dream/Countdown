[Intro]
Boy!

[Chorus]
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me you're out of your mind

[Hook]
My baby is a ten
We dressing to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky, seven
He kiss me in his six
We be making love in five
Still the one I do this four
I'm trying to make us three
From that two
He still the one

[Verse 1]
There's up's and downs in this love
Got a lot to learn in this love
Through the good and the bad, still got love
Dedicated to the one I love, hey
Still love the way he talk, still love the way I sing
Still love the way he rock them black diamonds in that chain
Still all up on each other, ain't a damn thing change
My girls can't tell me nothing, I'm gone in the brain
I'm all up under him like it's cold, winter time
All up in the kitchen in my heels, dinner time
Do whatever that it takes, he got a winner's mind
Give it all to him, meet him at the finish line

[Refrain]
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

[Chorus]
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me you're out of your mind

[Hook]
My baby is a ten
We dressing to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky, seven
He kiss me in his six
We be making love in five
Still the one I do this four
I'm trying to make us three
From that two
He still the one

[Verse 2]
Yup, I put it on him, it ain't nothing that I can't do
Yup, I buy my own, if he deserve it, buy his shit too
All up in the store, shorty, tricking if I want to
All up in the store, shorty, fly as we want to
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Damn, I think I love that boy, do anything for that boy (Boy)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Now I'll never be the same, you and me until the end

[Refrain]
Me and my boo in my boo's coupe riding
All up in that black with his chick right beside him
Ladies, if you love your man, show him you the fliest
Grind up on it, girl, show him how you ride it

[Refrain 2]
Me and my boo in the coupe lip locking
All up in the back because the chicks keep flocking
All that gossip in ten years, stop it
London speed it up, Houston rock it

[Chorus]
Oh, killing me softly and I'm still falling
Still the one I need, I will always be with you
Oh, you got me all gone, don't ever let me go
Say it real loud if you fly
If you leave me you're out of your mind

[Hook]
My baby is a ten
We dressing to the nine
He pick me up, we eight
Make me feel so lucky seven
He kiss me in his six
We be making love in five
Still the one I do this four
I'm trying to make us three
From that two
He still the one
