[Intro]
Ooh! Look at what mister man done done!
He in the club, showin' all the girls some love!

Bet you hear us!
I bet you hear us!
I bet you hear us!
Ay! Ay! Ay!

[Verse 1: Sarah]
Bill done met some girl up in the club
And got her pregnant!
I never trusted, now he's busted
'cause I'm always checkin!
Cell phones, Lies, Calls
I don't know this bitch at all!
Quit lyin', you be callin' her all the time!

[Chorus]
I'm bout to kill Bill! (Kill Bill!)
First thing in the morning!
Bout to Kill Bill! (Kill Bill!)
I'll catch him while he yawning!
Bout to Kill Bill! (Kill Bill!)
Radio might not play this record
I'll be a lot of things
But one thing I won't be is disrespected, Oh!

Ahhhhhh, Aahhhhh, Oh!
Aahhhhhh, Ahhhhh, Hell Yeah!
Ohhhhh! Aahhhhh, Ahhhhh!
Hell yeah!

[Verse 2: Sarah]
Til somebody gets hurt
Keep on playing like it's funny!
Served with them papers
Come on off top of that money!
Half this, half that!
Shopping Sprees in London!
And now you on a budget
And I'm spinnin' like Laundry!

[Bridge]
Ooh time after time
You told me, You told me
Lie after lie
Even though, even though
Not a day goes by
That you ain't on my mind
And once that money is gone
I'll be back to commit that crime!

[Chorus]
I'm bout to Kill Bill! (Kill Bill!)
First thing in the morning!
Bout to Kill Bill! (Kill Bill!)
I'll Catch him while he yawning!
Bout to Kill Bill! (Kill Bill!)
Radio might not play this record
I'll be a lot of things but one thing
But one thing I won't be DISRESPECTED, OH!

Ahhhhhh, Aahhhhh, Oh!
Aahhhhhh, Ahhhhh, Hell Yeah!
Oh! Aahhhhh, Ahhhhh!
Hell yeah!

[Verse 3]
Tried to be your girlfriend
Really what you wanted, you wanted
That ain't what you needed
Cause you don't know the difference
You messing with the wrong bitch
And there's no turning back now

Bill done met some girl up in the club
And got her pregnant!
I never trusted, now he's busted
'cause I'm always checkin!
Cell phones, lies, calls
I don't know this bitch at all
Quit lyin', You be callin her all the time!

[Chorus]
I'm bout to kill Bill! (Kill Bill!)
First thing in the morning!
Bout to kill Bill! (Kill Bill!)
I'll Catch him while he yawning!
Bout to kill Bill! (Kill Bill!)
Radio might not play this record
I'll be a lot of things but one thing
But one thing I won't be is disrespected, OH!

Ahhhhhh, Aahhhhh, Oh!
Aahhhhhh, Ahhhhh, Hell Yeah!
Ohhhhh! Aahhhhh, Ahhhhh!
Hell Yeah!
Hell Yeah!
Hell Yeah!
Hell Yeah!
