(Push)
Oh boy, she want a dope boy
She want to throw bands on her pole dance
No test drivin' that two door
She want to stunt with me on her old man
Oh God my IG is like iv to this lifestyle
I buy this shit, take a pic
And you OD on my life files

Shawty get it (get it)
Do it big, Do it good
Work it like a girl should
Work it good (work it good)
Bring it back (bring it back)
Tell the DJ bring it back
Let me touch it, fuck it baby
Tell your man he ain't getting it back
Shawty is so ratchet, baby I'm so ratchet
You so bomb with that, I got to have it
I got to have it, like a 9 I got to blast it
So fine I got to grab it, she don't mind

I got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty

Keep that pussy poppin' like that
I'ma get these bands poppin' like that
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
And I got my right hand on that pussy

Up in that six hundred
You ain't even seen it
Touchin' on it, rubbin' on it
Girl you got me feinin'
All about her money
And I'm all about my money
Million dollar babies plus alimony
First a nigga save you
(Then a nigga grave you)
And ain't nobody got time for that
So it's best just to pay ya
Thirteen cars I don't need nothing else
Just this booty on my lap
And this gold on my neck

I got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
(I love)
Now keep that booty rolling like that
Keep that pussy poppin' like that
I'ma get these bands poppin' like that
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
And I got my right hand on that pussy

The way you do got me very very very happy
She stare at me while I'm starin' at it
I'm a young sexy ass charismatic ass
Gorgeous face ass havin' ass nigga
That she love in her panty hose
She need this dick like its antidote
That pussy is a work of art painted by Michael Angelo
I wake up to pussy and cantaloupe
Then she made me fuck my appetite
Fuckin' so hard I'ma remember this in the afterlife
I tell her slob on my knob
Like its corn on the cob
She keep goin' oh my god
And my broad is so bad I can't hit from the back
All my favourite girls got my initials as tats
Finally Famous she throw this set up
Like Sororities and Frats
Niggas can't tell me shit but congrats

I got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
(I love)
Now keep that booty rolling like that
Keep that pussy poppin' like that
I'ma get these bands poppin' like that
Got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
Got my left hand on that booty
And I got my right hand on that pussy

Pull up to that traffic light
Stars bright wanna touch her
Gotta get it to the car
Oh shit I might love her
Straight up out of med school
Could be my baby momma

I got my left hand on that booty
Got my right hand on that pussy
