After we leave Be all you need
All those victoria sectrets let me see
Watch your feet never mind baby you owe me
For them drinks at the bar and for smoking this weed

(bridge)
He ain't like me
I can make your days and nights look like fantasies
He ain't got nothing on me
My garage looks like the duPont registry
I'm so suburb Shorty what's the word
If you looking for love (love, love) I'll give you what you deserve

(hook)
Stay your ass to the crib and - Ditch that ******
You try to f*ck are you still playing - Ditch that ******
You need a grown ass man girl - Ditch that ******
You understand what I'm saying girl - Ditch that ******
(I'm got them out on the floor like - Ditch that ****** 4x)
(I got them up in the club - Ditch that ****** 4x)

See she got needs She laid up in my roll
She got your text 'when you wanna get it' she said not yet
After the finally She got you on the phone
Sid that she wasn't coming home Then she downloaded my ringtone

(bridge)

(hook)
Got what you want Grab what you need
Have another drink I'm taking her with me
Enter the Phantom Proceed the creep
Extit the Phantom Up in them sheets

Grab my neck squeeze my hands
Touch your twins squeeze your ass
Not to slow not to fast
DJ run this motherfucker back

(hook)
Bring your ass to the crib and - Ditch that ******
You try to f*ck are you still playing - Ditch that ******
You need a grown ass man girl - Ditch that ******
You understand what I'm saying girl - Ditch that ******
(I'm got them out on the floor like - Ditch that ****** 4x)
(I got them up in the club - Ditch that ****** 4x)

(girl)
Hold on Give me a second
You got at least let him drop me off
Baby you know when I see you

Now I got what she want and she see what she want in me
And I ain't here to beef (even though you fighting) Let I be she's coming with me

I got them up in the club
She's leaving with me

In the club toppin hundreds
Heard you got a little car
But she's coming with me 6x
Cause I got a lot of love
Now she wanna fill me **??**
Keep throwing that money up
But she's coming with me 6x
