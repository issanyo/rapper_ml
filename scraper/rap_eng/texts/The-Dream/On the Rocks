[Verse 1]
You're all out there waiting
To break my heart again
Break my heart, dear friend
You're unwanting
Yet still contemplating
Break my heart again
Oh, dear friend

[Pre-Chorus]
Bet you thought all that runnin' 'round wasn't gon' catch up wit' ya
Let that door hit your ass, I'll photoshop you out this picture
See you wasn't around for this
So you might wanna sit down for this
It hurt so bad that I should cry
Awkward silence, you know why

[Chorus]
Let's have a drink
Let's have a drink
No, you sit right there
Here's to you and me, oh oh
Let's take a shot
Since you've been taking shots
And allow me to serve you this break-up
On the rocks

[Post-Chorus]
One, two, three!
(Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
On the rocks
(Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
(Oh, oh ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
On the rocks
And allow me to serve you this break-up
On the rocks
On the rocks

[Verse 2]
Now you're out there without me
Breaking hearts again, oh dear friend
Well I tried to tell you, that love would show you
That you would break your own heart in the end

[Chorus]
Let's have a drink
Let's have a drink
No, you sit right there
Here's to you and me, oh oh
Let's take a shot
Since you've been taking shots
And allow me to serve you this break-up on the rocks
On the rocks

[Post-Chorus]
One, two, three!
(Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
On the rocks
(Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
(Oh, oh ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
On the rocks
And allow me to serve you this break-up
On the rocks
On the rocks

[Bridge]
Bet you thought all that runnin' 'round wasn't gon' catch up wit' ya
Let that door hit your ass, I'll photoshop you out this picture

[Chorus]
Let's have a drink
Let's have a drink
No, you sit right there
Here's to you and me, oh oh
Let's take a shot
Since you've been taking shots
And allow me to serve you this break-up on the rocks
On the rocks

[Post-Chorus]
One, two, three!
(Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
On the rocks
(Oh, oh, ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
You never miss a good thing 'til it's gone
(Oh, oh ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
On the rocks
And allow me to serve you this break-up
On the rocks
On the rocks

[Outro]
(Oh, oh ooh, oh, oh, ooh)
On the rocks
And allow me to serve you this break-up
On the rocks
On the rocks
