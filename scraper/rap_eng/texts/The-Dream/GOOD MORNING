[Verse 1]
The sun creeps in
She says I love you with a smile on her face
If time could stand still
We could lay under the covers all day

[Chorus 1]
She makes this a home
In winter keeps me warm
In summer makes it hot for me
In the fall & spring fresh lovin she brings
When I open up my eyes she sings

[Chorus 2]
Good morning
Its a beautiful day
When Im with her
With me she lays

[Chorus 3]
Good morning
Another beautiful day
The sun rises
When I see your face
Everyday
Good morning [x2]

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wake
A little grumpy, moody
She says no way
Cause shes so positive
She gives me love
Gets me ready for my day

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Verse 3]
If she cooks your breakfast with love
Gives you kisses with love
Rubs your back with love
Than you better wake up
Say you (love her)
Tell her that you (love her)
Cause every breath that you breathe
Everyday that you see
Is not guaranteed
Oh no
Every morning [x2]
Tell her

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]

[Outro]
Tell her good morning
Good morning
