Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I find myself in love racing the Earth
And I soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And, me and you belong

I wanna run, run
Smack into you
I wanna run, run
Smack into you

Ears closed
What I hear, no one else has to know
Cause I know
That what we have is worth first place in gold
And I soaked in your love
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And, me and you belong
And I...

I wanna run, run
Smack into you
I'm willing to run, run
Smack into you

Woah oh, oh
Woah oh, oh

Head down
As I watch my feet take turns hitting the ground
Eyes shut
I’m in love and I'm racing the Earth
And I soaked in your love (ah)
And love is right in my path, in my grasp
And, me and you belong
And I...

Wanna run, run
Smack into you
I'm willing to run, run
Smack into you
I’m willing to run, run, run, run, run
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh)

I wanna run, run
Smack into you
I'm willing to run, run
Smack into you
