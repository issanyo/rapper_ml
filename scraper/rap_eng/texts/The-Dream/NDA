[Intro]
Public announcement
Let everybody know how we're gettin' down
You got a problem, say it now

[Pre-Chorus]
You the one that started flirtin'
You the one that started touchin'
You the one that was up to somethin' bad (Bad)
You the one that started textin'
You the one that started sextin'
You the one that started stressin' at me
Waste no time, drop that pin
Then drop that lace, and let me in
Don't close the door, let them see
Tell everybody about you and me

[Chorus]
This my NDA
So you know when you come around me
You know me and you be on that freak shit
You know how it is around me
So turn the song off if you disagree
This my NDA
If it's one o'clock then you know what we doin'
I respect you so I'm tellin' you how I'm movin'
No loose ends
Tell me how you want this thing to be

[Verse 1]
At 11:30 we could have brunch, I might be a little bit late
Give me 30, I'll see you for lunch, Louis XIII
It's two o'clock, we gotta wrap this up
Up, we get up, I see you hikin' that skirt up (I see you)
It's three o'clock now
She like, "What you doin' later?"
I thought this was over business
Soon as I sat down sure she looked at me and said, "What you think this is?"
And started laughing (Ooh)
I'm like, "What... the fuck?"
We left, I got a message
That said, "I"ll see you tonight around 1"

[Pre-Chorus]
You the one that started flirtin'
You the one that started touchin'
You the one that was up to somethin' bad (You were)
You the one that started textin'
You the one that started sextin'
You the one that started stressin' at me (Yeah)
Waste no time (Waste no time), drop that pin (Drop that pin)
Then drop that lace (Drop the lace), and let me in (Let me in)
Don't close the door (Close the door), let them see (Let them see)
Tell everybody about you and me

[Chorus]
This my NDA
So you know when you come around me
You know me and you be on that freak shit
You know how it is around me
So turn the song off if you disagree
This my NDA
If it's one o'clock then you know what we doin'
I respect you so I'm tellin' you how I'm movin'
No loose ends
Tell me how you want this thing to be

[Bridge]
Girl you gotta tell me how (How), when (When), where (Where)
Can I talk to you? (How should I?)
How to holler, approach you?
'Cause some girls like their sex at work
Some girls like good sex at home
Some girls like friends joinin' in
Some girls love it on they own
Some girls like they man aggressive
Some girls like conservative
Some girls don't know what they like 'cause they ain't never came for real
Some girls love that shit in public
Some girls like that private show
But if you never ever told me
How the fuck am I to know?
Some girls like it soft and sweet
Some girls like it hard and deep
Some girls don't like suckin' dick
Most girls I know love that shit

[Chorus]
This my NDA
So you know when you come around me
You know me and you be on that freak shit
You know how it is around me
So turn the song off if you disagree
This my NDA
If it's one o'clock then you know what we doin'
I respect you so I'm tellin' you how I'm movin'
No loose ends
Tell me how you want this thing to be (Tell me how you want this thing to be)

[Outro]
(Some girls like good sex at home
Some girls like friends joinin' in
Some girls love it on they own
Some girls like they man aggressive
Some girls like conservative
Some girls don't know what they like 'cause they ain't never came for real
Some girls love that shit in public
Some girls like that private show
But if you never ever told me
How the fuck am I to know?
Some girls like it soft and sweet
Some girls like it hard and deep
Some girls don't like suckin' dick
That ain't who we fuckin' with)
Love that shit
Know you love that shit
(Tell 'em what you really wanted
Tell 'em how you really want it)
Love that shit
(Tell 'em all about the moment
Girl I know you love that shit)
I know you love that shit
I know you love that shit
Girl I know you love that shit
I know you love that shit
If you love that shit
Embellish it
If you love that shit
Really love that shit
Then embellish it
No, no, no, no
