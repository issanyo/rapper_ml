You got me kinda open on you; I'm kinda sweet on you
Now that you got my attention, baby make me you mission, yeah

Blow it up, blow it up, boom, boom, boom like dynamite
Giving you my heart baby, now imma say what every girl is probably thinking!

Baby, cause I've been here before!
You better not fuck this up x3

Verse 2
I can give a fuck what you did; I only care about what you're doing
Boy just make sure that you're rocking me through the night, and again in the morning

Before i have to put my hands on you baby, Imma say what every girl is probably thinking

Oh, I don't need the bullshit, I just wanna live, and I just wanna give

If you want it!
