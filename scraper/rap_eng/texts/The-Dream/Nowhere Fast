Hope your not thinking, you ain't the one
Seems your annoyed by my voice
Because your out there trickin'
'Til five in the morning
I don't play that shit (oh)
Hope your not thinking, you can just leave
Homeboy please
From the tone of my voice
I know that you can see
I don't play that shit

No, no, no
I ain't low on self esteem
No, no, no, no, no
Other girls don't strike fear in me
I work this relationship nine to five
And I deserve overtime
So you can say what you want
Stake on what you want
You ain't leaving me

You can say what you want
Stage on what you want
You ain't leaving me

All of the nights you had me trippin'
All of the nights you had me stressin'
You ain't going nowhere

Till I get a return on my investment
All of the nights you had me trippin'
All of the nights you had me stressin'

Seems that your tired of my face
Cause your always looking at some other chicks

Oh hope your not thinking, you can just dis me

By the look on my grill
I know that you can tell
