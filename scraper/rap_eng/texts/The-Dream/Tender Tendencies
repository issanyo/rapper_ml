[This needs to be revised]

You wanna tell ‘em how bad I hurt you
Yeah I know
You wanna tell them how I mistreated your love
Well here we go
I’ll tell them about all the lies
I’ll tell them how harsh I am, and that’s why you cry
I'll tell them how I hide my faults
Hmm, under my truth-less talk
I said I would never leave no matter what
And here I am leaving no matter what
You know I have tender tendencies
You know I battle this shit daily
You know after my charm, my tendencies go off like alarms
And baby I know, baby I know, I know, I know, I know, baby I know
Listen baby I know, baby I know, I know, I know, baby I know

So I’ll sing this song for you
La-da-da-da-da
I’ll sing this song for you
La-da-da-da-da
I’m asking what to do since I made your heart all blue
She said sing this song for me about you
I’ll tell them how impatient I am
I’ll tell them how self-centered I am
I won’t hide a thing
I’ll tell them bout these secrets I’ve had
I’ll tell them about my insecurities
You know, I have tender tendencies
You know I battle this shit daily
You know after my bullshit and charm these tendencies go off like alarms
And baby I know, baby I know, I know, I know, I know, baby I know
Baby I know, baby I know, I know, I know, I know, baby I know

Baby I go off like alarms
My tendencies go off like alarms, baby
So allow me to sing this song for you’
La-da-da-da-da
I’ll sing your song for you
Baby La-da-da-da-da
So I’m asking what to do since I made your heart all blue
She said sing this song for me about you
Baby I know
(you know I can’t stand it)
I know, I know, I know
(Don’t you dare leave me here)
Please baby pick up the ṗhone
You just left and you already miss
Here all alone in this room and there’s no sign of you
Just me and your perfume, lingering in my doom
