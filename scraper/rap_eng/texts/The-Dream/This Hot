Dream
Oh, yeah
Here the girl
Oh, they on the floor
Gettin' wit your boy
TGC, babe
Ha

I can do me all on my own
Baby, please believe it
Young, fly, flashy
Switch my wardrobe every season
Now he wanna holler
Make it hard to find a reason
Cause I know I'm hot
And I know you see it

Give me a break
Shoot me the game
Tell me your name
I'm not like the rest
She might be hot
But we not the same
I ain't got it for cheap
I'm like the sun
Dry up the rain
If you get it from me
That means I gave it to you

'Cause when you this hot
You ain't gotta do nothing but mm-hmm
This hot
You ain't gotta say nothing but mm-hmm
This hot
Dance up on him
Make that booty mm-hmm
This hot, mm-hmm
This hot, mm-hmm

I know you used to them quick chicks
Saying boy come and see me
I'm still trying to pencil
You in before the weekend
You riding big, I'm in them same cars
Willing to give it to you
Gotta be up on your game, dude

Give me a break
Shoot me the game
Tell me your name
I'm not like the rest
She might be hot
But we not the same
I ain't got it for cheap
I'm like the sun
Dry up the rain
If you get it from me
That means I gave it to you

'Cause when you this hot
You ain't gotta do nothing but mm-hmm
This hot
You ain't gotta say nothing but mm-hmm
This hot
Dance up on him
Make that booty mm-hmm
This hot, mm-hmm
This hot, mm-hmm

'Cause when you this hot
You ain't gotta do nothing but mm-hmm
This hot
You ain't gotta say nothing but mm-hmm
This hot
Dance up on him
Make that booty mm-hmm
This hot, mm-hmm
This hot, mm-hmm
