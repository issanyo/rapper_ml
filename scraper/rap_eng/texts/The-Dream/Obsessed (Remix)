[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I guess shorty mad he don't got you no more
So just like Pinocchio, his nose gon' grow
Gucci Mane, Mariah Carey bling blaw wow
I wish I had a lie detector test right now
He hit my girl, word? Oh that's what you heard?
He know he a bird, I know he a nerd
Catch me in the A with a bad yellow bone
9, 10, 11, 12 diamond chains on

[Mariah Carey]
All up in the blogs
Saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Say we up in your house
Saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you're so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
Cause you be poppin', hood, you get it poppin

Oooh whooa
Why you so obsessed with me?
Boy I want to know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me
When everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Ooooh
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex

Oooh-oooh-oooh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
(oh-oh-whooa-oh) (2x)
And all the ladies sing
(oh-oh-whooa-oh) (2x)
All the girls sing
O o-o-o o-oh obsessed
O o-o-o o-oh obsessed
O o-o-o o-oh obsessed

[Gucci Mane]
If you sexy and you fine baby put your hands up
And tell your ex-boyfriend to get his bands up
Don't lying know your stick, homeboy man up
All my real get money ballers stand up
You see her with the kid, you know what it is
Gucci, get the girl flawless, you what we did
Shorty stay fresh, got 'em obsessed
Simply cause she blessed
You know she the best, yes

[Mariah Carey]
You on your job, you hittin' hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'mma let you starve
Graspin' for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waitin'
Tellin' the world how much you miss me
But we never were so why you trippin'?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you're a conversation

Oooh whooa
Why you so obsessed with me?
Boy I want to know
Lyin' that you're sexin' me
When everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me
Ooooh
Finally found a girl that you couldn't impress
Last man on the earth still couldn't get this

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy you're losing your mind
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex

Oooh-oooh-oooh
Boy, why you so obsessed with me?
(oh-oh-whooa-oh) (2x)
And all the ladies sing
(oh-oh-whooa-oh) (2x)
All the girls sing
O o-o-o o-oh obsessed
O o-o-o o-oh obsessed
O o-o-o o-oh obsessed
