[Intro The Dream and (Girl)]
I fell in love with a real heart breaker
(I'm so sorry)
And there's nothing I can do to shake her
Ohhh ohh ay ay ay ay ayy
(It's not you; it's me)
Ohhh ohh ay ay ay ay ayy
Breaker
(I still love you)
Ohhh ohh ay ay ay ay ayy
Can't shake her
Yaaaaaaa

[Verse 1]
You touch me baby, then you un-touch me baby
You feed me your lies, words like pie
You want me baby, then you un-want me baby
Outsmart me baby, now I'm all crazy

[Pre Hook]
But I should be ashamed cause I
Let you do me this way and it's
Unfortunate, that when you're in love
You never use

[Hook]
The right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain

[Verse 2]
You loved me baby, un-loved me baby
You lead me on, lock the doors on love's home
You heart me baby, then you hardly baby
You need me baby, and then you send me gone
You'll say I'm your friend, up until the end
When you tell it baby, you know how to sell it baby, dontcha

[Pre Hook]
But I should be ashamed cause I let
You treat me this way, can't lie it's
Unfortunate to say that love
Never let's me use

[Hook]
The right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain
Right side of your brain

[Verse 3]
You love me baby, unlove me baby
Let me be, set me free
You're near me baby, but not near me baby
You sayin' I'm your friend, then why are we at the end?

[Pre Hook]
But I should be ashamed cause I let
You do me this way, and I
Known all this time
I should have been using

[Hook]
The right side of my brain
Right side of my brain
Right side of my brain
Right side of my brain
Right side of my brain
Right side of my brain
Right side of my brain
Right side of my brain
