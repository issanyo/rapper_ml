[Verse 1]
I'm, so in love with you
Why, don't know what'd I do
If your, not by my side
I can kiss this whole world goodbye

[Chorus]
I need you
I wanna be engulfed by you
You keep me high
Feels I've drugged by you
When I'm being loved by my baby
Sweet baby
It would take a fool to not know that what we have is
Something special
Special, oh, special, oh, oh, special
It would take a fool to not know that what we have is
Special

[Verse 2]
Oh boy, this fire can't be replaced by no one
Even if oceans are staring in our face
Take the wind from the air
Light the world up if they dare
Me and you, you and I, burning infinitely

[Chorus]
All I need is you
I wanna be engulfed by you
You keep me high
Feels I've drugged by you
When I'm being loved by my baby
Sweet baby
It would take a fool to not know that what we have is
Something special
Something special, special, special
Something special, special
It would take a fool to not know that what we have is
Something special

[Bridge]
You bring sunlight to my face
Excel my rainy days
Always pray your love will shine my way, my way, my way, my way
So let the storms come, I'll stand there in my come
No need to run, I'm with you, okay, okay, okay, okay

[Chorus]
All I need is you
I wanna be engulfed by you
You keep me high
Feels I've drugged by you
When I'm being loved by my baby
Sweet baby
It would take a fool to not know that what we have is
Something special
Something special, special, special
We've got something special baby, special
All I need is you
We've got something special
