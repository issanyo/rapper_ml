[Intro]
Mmm, I'm praying (1651)

[Chorus]
Baby, give me your love tonight
And I'll be yours, babe, forever and alive
Baby, give me your love tonight
And I'll be yours, babe, forever and alive
Baby, give me your love tonight
And I'll be yours, babe, forever and alive
Baby, give me your love tonight
And I'll be yours, babe, forever and alive

[Verse 1]
I can see that look in your eyes
You want me to take you there
To that place you've never seen, that disguise
Wanna meet you there, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Though they talk about those things they say that I can't do
And they'll talk behind our backs, say I'm no good for you
But I can be honest, if that's the price, consider it done
Oh baby, take me home

[Chorus]
Baby, give me your lovin' tonight
And I'll be yours, babe, forever and alive
Baby, give me your love tonight
And I'll be yours, babe, forever and alive

[Verse 2]
And I don't wanna ruin you
I'll treat you fair, that's what you like
Or we can choose a darker side
Still, I'll meet you there, no need to fight

[Pre-Chorus]
Though they talk about the things they say that I can't do
And they'll talk behind our backs, say I'm no good for you
But I can be honest, if that's the price

[Chorus]
Baby, give me your lovin' tonight
And I'll be yours, babe (Yeah), forever and alive
Baby, give me (Give me) your love tonight
And I'll be yours, babe, forever and alive

[Outro]
Baby, give me your love tonight
And I'll be yours, babe, forever and alive
Baby, give me your love tonight
And I'll be yours, babe, forever and alive (1651)
