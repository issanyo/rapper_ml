[Intro]
Uh, uh, uh
Radio killer
Beat that shit up like gorilla

[Chorus]
Your body (Body)
Your body (Body)
Your body (Body)
Your body (Body)
And my body (Body)
My body (Body)
My body (Body)
My body (Body)
And I will love
I will love
I will love
I will love
The way we fuck
When we fuck
How we fuck

[Refrain]
Girl, you make me forget about ex-girlfriends
And I'm gon' make you forget about ex-boyfriends too
I'ma send a picture of your pussy to my ex's DM
And you gon' send a picture of my pussy to your ex's DM
We both know it's comin', niggas be hatin' when you're not next to them
Contemplatin' when you're not next to them
Ooh, so jump down in my comments, tell me how you really feelin'
All that talkin' ain't gon' change shit but my mothafuckin' filter
All that fuck shit make me hard, more just make her wet
Then we fuck 'til we fuckin' forget

[Chorus]
Your body (Body)
Your body (Body)
Your body (Body)
Your body (Body)
And my body (Body)
My body (Body)
My body (Body)
My body (Body)
And I will love
I will love
I will love
I will love
The way we fuck
When we fuck
How we fuck

[Verse]
Girl, you so real, we shouldn't even play pretend
Dress up, then I mess up every inch of you (Boo)
Clean it up like maid (Maid), right here on the kitchen counter
M.I.A. (A), we both missing in Atlanta
She throw on Versace, I'm like, "Girl, you got me"
And we halfway out the door
One, two, three, ready, go
We back in the bed, how do I say it? VÃ¡monos

[Refrain]
Girl, you make me forget about ex-girlfriends
And I'm gon' make you forget about ex-boyfriends too
I'ma send a picture of your pussy to my ex's DM
And you gon' send a picture of my pussy to your ex's DM
We both know it's comin', niggas be hatin' when you're not next to them
Contemplatin' when you're not next to them
Ooh, so jump down in my comments, tell me how you really feelin'
All that talkin' ain't gon' change shit but my mothafuckin' filter
All that fuck shit make me hard, more just make her wet
Then we fuck 'til we fuckin' forget

[Chorus]
Your body (Body)
Your body (Body)
Your body (Body)
Your body (Body)
And my body (Body)
My body (Body)
My body (Body)
My body (Body)
And I will love
I will love
I will love
I will love
The way we fuck
When we fuck
How we fuck

[Bridge]
Last thoughts, last thoughts
I heard you got last thoughts, last thoughts
Me and boo 'bout to blast off, blast off
And we gon' out-last y'all, out-last y'all

[Outro]
Your body (Body...)
My body (Body...)
I will love...
The way we fuck...
The way we fuck...
