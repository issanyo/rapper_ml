[Verse 1]
Now I don't wanna just buy you shit
Though super deep in my mind, girl I wonder how lit you get
Ready made promises
Don't just wanna see how you look when you riding it
We made you promises
But I want to be the one that makes you change your mind

[B-Section]
Now B said the best revenge is your paper
Well I think your best revenge is my human nature
You don't need me to save ya
I see you got it covered with Paris, embroidered labels
Do me no favors
Just sit that thang down
Open it up and let me taste it
You say you don't need me
I'm in knee deep

[Hook]
Say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You say you don't need me
Just wanna make you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm in knee deep
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm knee deep
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just wanna make you say

[Verse 2]
Still I'ma love you the same
Whatever I bought, girl you got it
Whatever I've broken, I'll buy it
Tattoo your namesake all over my body
I don't see you the same
I see a queen
You should see a king
I never put you up under me
Even while you layin' under me
And I'm not tryin' to get under you
I just wish to be under you
She like what that mean
Sippin' that lemon lean
Girl come here
Lemme tear your skin off
Tear your body off, oh
Girl where you put your heart at?
Let me put your heart back, oh
Girl who am I kiddin'?
And who are you bullshittin'?
You know you need somebody to come through and lick it, lick it
Kiss it, kiss it
Time ticking, ticking
Let me be sweet to you
Stop being so vicious
Vindictive
Lemme be good to you
Lemme be good to you

Now B said the best revenge is your paper

Say ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You say you don't need me
Just wanna make you say
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm in knee deep
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm knee deep
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just wanna make you say

[Verse 3]
But how do I come off not chauvinistic?
The truth is too simple to use against me
You're so addictive
You gotta know that you're so addictive
I only got one job and you tryin' to take it from me
I only got one job and you tryna take you from me
Girl why would you take you from me?
I've broke religious laws for ya
For centuries, centuries, centuries
I've went to war for ya
I do this for you
You think that I don't, but I do
I do this for you
I'm still the same
I'm still that carpenter
They took me from both of us
I'm still a warrior
It's all good
Just take me when it falls like Rome again
When it's time to defend homes again
Take bullets for ya
I still adore ya
Act like you belong to this
Put down your phone and shit
Come and handle this
Don't dismantle this

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm in knee deep
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I'm knee deep
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Just wanna make you say
