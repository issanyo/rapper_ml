[Intro]
Yo, what up girl
How you doin
I was thinkin We'd go back to my place
Or sumthin'
Uh

[Verse 1]
One kiss and I had you hooked
Got you callin' me every day and night
One touch and I had you shook
Now your tellin' all your girls that I do it right
Told me that I was the first
That ever made you wanna do the things you do
First one who ever put it down
First one who ever made you say

[Chorus]
Ooooh, I love it when you make me go, Ooooh
'Cause then you wanna gimmie some, Ooooh
All because I made you go, Ooooh, Ooooh
Ooooh, I love it when I make you go, Ooooh
'Cause then you wanna gimmie some, Oooh
All because I made you go, Ooooh, Ooooh

[Verse 2]
Your body all over me
Got me up against the wall to your favourite song
All night and I can't believe
That you can keep it goin 'til the early morn'
Whatever you want from me
Its yours all because of how you make me feel
Ain't nothing that I wouldn't do
All because you always make me go

[Chorus]
Tell me the way you like it, fast or slow
I know the way to make you lose control
Won't take advantage, baby, of your love
Just wanna make sure that you get enough
[Ad libs]
What, why you (??) girl
Okay, I get it
You want me to do what?
Right here?
Oh!
Said you want it
Said you need it
Gotta have it
Oh!
Said you want it
Said you need it
Gotta have it
All I wanna do is make you go Ooooh
Love it when you make me go
Ill make you say Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh
Make you say Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh
And it feels so good
Love it when I make you go
Make you say Ooooh Ooooh Ooooh
And it feels so good
