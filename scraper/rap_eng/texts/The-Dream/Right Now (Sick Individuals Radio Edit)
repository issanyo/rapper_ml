[Chorus: Rihanna]
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Drop: Sick Individuals]

[Verse: Rihanna]
So close, I can taste you
Ain't scared, I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Got me fiendin'
You got me fiendin'
Baby, tonight I need you
And I feel it when I see you
Wherever you wanna go
Whenever, baby, I'm yours

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Breakdown 1: Rihanna]
'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
Right now, right now, right now
'Cause all we got is right now

[Breakdown 2: Rihanna]
So get up right now
You got me fiendin'
So get up right now
