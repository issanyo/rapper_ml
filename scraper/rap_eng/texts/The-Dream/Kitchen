[Intro]
Yeah (x8)
Let the piano man play
Let the piano man play

[Verse 1]
I'm calling you in the middle of the night
Before we have a little problem
You you you, me and you, you you
And it ain't gon' be no foolin' around
Between him and you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
Him and you girl

[Verse 2]
I know a lotta girls who don't need a man
But I need this one
(I need this one)
And I know you might need you a man
But you ain't gettin' this one
(Ain't gettin' this one, no, no, no)

[Pre-Chorus]
See I can have anybody baby I ain't stressin'
But what I've done for him I consider him an investment
Tryna take my man is like tryna take money
And tryna take my money
Well, just ain't happening

[Chorus]
I don't know it all, but I tell you what I know
Never let a girl cook in ya kitchen
All up in yo fridge, and next will be the stove
Never let a girl cook in ya kitchen
When it all gets hot, everything drops
Eyes on your man, hands on yo pot
If she runs in to help, tell her stay right in her spot
Never let girl a cook in yo kitchen

[Verse 2]
See I'm sorry but I'm have to shut them burners
Down, down, down
So we can keep it cool
Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool, cool yeah!
See I don't need no extra ingredients
There's not enough cabinent space for two
Two, two, two, two, two, two, two

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I can have anybody baby I ain't stressin'
But what I've done for him I consider him an investment
Tryna take my man is like tryna take money
And tryna take my money
Well, just ain't happening

[Chorus]
I don't know it all, but I tell you what I know
Never let a girl cook in ya kitchen
All up in yo fridge, and next will be the stove
Never let a girl cook in ya kitchen
When it all gets hot, everything drops
Eyes on your man, hands on yo pot
If she runs in to help, tell her stay right in her spot
Never let girl a cook in yo kitchen
(Never, never, never)

[Post-Chorus]
If you know what I'm saying, say oooh...
I know what you're saying

[Hook]
I've seen it all before
(Seen it all before)
And I rather show you out
Cause I really don't want you around
There's the door, just let you walk up in this kitchen
Girl you got me twisted

[Chorus]
I don't know it all, but I tell you what I know
Never let a girl cook in ya kitchen
All up in yo fridge, and next will be the stove
Never let a girl cook in ya kitchen
When it all gets hot, everything drops
Eyes on your man, hands on yo pot
If she runs in to help, tell her stay right in her spot
Never let girl a cook in yo kitchen
(Never, never, never)

I know what you're saying
