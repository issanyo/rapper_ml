That was love
That was then
That was us, miracles
I changed you
You changed me
This is how these things go
I was broke
And you were scared
But you stayed by my side, yea

I was yours
You were mine
It seemed we'd last forever, oh yea
I'd be the one you need
You would be the one I marry
And I'm just trying to invite my way back in your heart
And I'm telling you to...

Come to me
I'll restore freedom
I'll carve away the worries in your heart

Your heart is missed
I'm a mess, what happened to second chance
This is now, this is how easy things can get out of hand
We were cold, and we were slow then, now we end faster than light, than light

And I'm not ashamed cause my love ain't changed
I'm prepared to beg you back the whole way
Bring me your arms, I'll bring mine too
And we will heal, mend, me and you, telling you...

Come to me
I'll restore freedom
I'll carve away the worries in your heart
I'm telling you to...

Come to me
I'll restore freedom
I'll carve away the worries in your heart
And I'm here to make peace, peace, peace
I'm here to make peace, peace, peace
I'm here to make peace, peace, peace
I'm here to make peace, between u and I

Through my doors, and take my hand
Replace our love beyond this land
This is just too much to give away
I love you baby, so why don't you stay

Let the air of your voice dry my tears
Let "I love you", fall on my ears
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you
I want you to just...

Come to me
I'll restore freedom
I'll carve away your worries in your heart
And I'll be here to make peace
I'm here to make peace peace peace
I'm here to make peace peace peace
I'm here to make peace peace peace between you and I

Wanna make peace with you peace baby
I don't wanna fight, I just wanna do everything right
Show me how to make peace with you
I do wanna make peace with you
