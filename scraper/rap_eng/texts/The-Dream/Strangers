Why do you insist on telling me that she’s nothing to you?
Why do you complain about her to me as if it ain’t true
If you don’t love her, leave her right now for me
If you don’t care about her, then where’s my key?
I got questions about us. I got questions about us
There’s nothing special about us
Every now and then we dro and Mary Jane-ing
So hot, so hot til we over flaming
Shoot first, shoot first in the eye of danger
Our friend know but this is what we tell the strangers
It ain’t nothin’
Me and you, this ain’t nothin’
Us two? This ain’t nothing
Even if it’s true, if it’s true
What we might have, it ain’t nothin
No matter what it looks like
When I’m with you boy I’m out my mind
But I never go too far; I always come back in time
1000 thread counts on the sheets
Is where we draw the line?
Anything over or under I don’t mind
You ain’t mine

If you don’t love her, leave her right now for me
If you don’t care about her, then where’s my key?
They got questions about us. They got questions about us
There’s something special about us
Every now and then we dro and Mary Jane-ing
So hot, so hot til we over flaming
Shoot first, shoot first in the eye of danger
Our friend know but this is what we tell the strangers
It ain’t nothin’
Me and you, this ain’t nothin’
Us two? This ain’t nothing
What we might have, it ain’t nothin
No matter what it looks like
