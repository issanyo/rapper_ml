[Intro]
Yeah, love me
Make me feel special

[Verse 1]
You got that photo love, the kind of love to make me fall in love again
Pour it in a bottle, baby, I can't get enough of it
Addicted to this feeling, got me floating high up in the sky, sky
In the crowded room I close my eyes and I'm alone with you
Now we're on to something, baby, tell me what you wanna do
First I was reluctant 'til you touched and then I gave it a try, try

[Pre-Chorus]
Love me, early in the morning
Make me feel so special, every time, time
Love me, early in the morning
Make me feel so special, look in my eyes, eyes

[Chorus]
Baby I'm warning you, you gon' make me fall hard for you
And when I fall for you, I'ma give this love to you
I'ma make you go (up & down)
Cause you make me go (up & down)
I'ma make you go (up & down)
Cause you make me go (up & down)
Baby I'm warning you, you gon' make me fall hard for you
And when I fall for you, I'ma give this love to you
I'ma make you go (up & down)
Cause you make me go (up & down)
I'ma make you go (up & down)
Cause you make me go (up & down)

[Verse 2]
And now we're making music, melodies are taking over you
Caught up in the moment, keep it going I'm ingrown with you
I can't hold it back, back
I'ma give 100, what you give I'll give it back to you
Drive me crazy, baby, be the leader show me what to do
Yeah, I like that

[Pre-Chorus]
Love me, early in the morning
Make me feel so special, every time, time
Love me, early in the morning
Make me feel so special, look in my eyes, eyes

[Chorus]
Baby I'm warning you, you gon' make me fall hard for you
And when I fall for you, I'ma give this love to you
I'ma make you go (up & down)
Cause you make me go (up & down)
I'ma make you go (up & down)
Cause you make me go (up & down)
