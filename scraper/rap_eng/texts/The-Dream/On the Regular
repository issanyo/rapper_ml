She got the body of a goddess
Tryna hit them curves like Ducatis
Fontainebleau, it's goin' down in the lobby
Leave your friends right here, ain't no room in the 'Rari
She turn the coupe to tsunami
We drive the route like money
Rollin' down Collins, we both starrin'
Young Quincy, young Jenny

[Verse 3]
You got my heart and my soul
You got me out of control
You got my everything, ooh
And when I try to let go
Girl, you put me in that hold
You've got my everything, mmm
Now, every time I leave her, I can't wait to come home
I come right back to see her, oh baby, let's get it on
She's the one for me, the girl of my dreams
She wear all the kinda shit I like until she get naked for me
We on that good drink, good drink, baby
Shawty, whoadi, baby
Homie, soulmate, lady, uh
We roll that good dank, good dank, baby
Take flight, all night, baby
Top shelf, six flights, baby, uh
You got my heart and my soul
You have me outta control
You got my everything, oh
And when I try to let go
Girl, you put me in that hold
You've got me, oh, you've got me every day, every day, oh
Going up and down your body, body
I don't really care who's watching, watching
With you, there really ain't no other options
I'm here to give you praise, amen, I'm just sayin'

[Outro]
Baby, say you're mine
The best love of all time
Love or double lie, ooh
Say you'll be right here
Let me know you're sincere
Bringing it home to me for the rest of your life
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah, oh ah
