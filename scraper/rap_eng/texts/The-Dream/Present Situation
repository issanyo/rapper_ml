[Verse 1]
With every breath in my lungs, I'm gone
Scream out my mind 'cause I miss you so
But eventually, I get over you
Hit up the mall and drop a couple bands off
Spending money is my antidote, yeah
Don't that sound like somebody you know? Yeah
She hurt you, you hurt me
But without her, we wouldn't be
So I don't know what to say right now
And I don't know where to be right now

[Chorus 1]
How do I address the present situation?
The present situation
The present situation
I don't know how to address the present situation
The present situation

[Verse 2]
So when you started out tricking on me
You was trying to get over her
And when you started to lay me down
You was still getting over her
I wonder if you love me now
Or if you ever loved me at all
A baseless love and still we fall
And I'mma tell myself that every nigga seem irrelevant
(Just sex me right)
I'mma keep on showing it so much that I start to forget
(I love the light)
And I gotta acquire your taste
Swallowing straight with no chase
(This ain't right)
Then I start to come around
That's the Sevyn they heard about
But then you have to hold me down

[Chorus 2]
I got a present situation
Oh, present situation
We gotta address the present situation
I don't know how to address the present situation
The present situation

[Bridge]
And I can't lie, I love it
I can't lie, I love it
It ain't right, I love it
I wouldn't have chose this life, but I love it

[Chorus 3]
The present situation
The present situation
The present situation
I don't know how to address the present situation
The present situation
