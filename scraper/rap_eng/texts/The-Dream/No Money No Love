[Intro: Elliphant]
(I do it all, yeah yeah yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Ms. Dynamite & Elliphant]
Born in this world of sin
It's no money no love, no money no love
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
In case you wanna hear it again
It's no money no love, no money no love
(Yeah)
It's sure you love me now as the world is in my favor
Watch me while I disappear
No money no love

[Verse 1: Elliphant]
I get my heart scarred from all my sin
Was my payback to never feel all again
Can you see the scars bruising my skin?
Oh I well wish I could erase them and start all over again

[Pre-Chorus: Elliphant]
Maybe I should get down on my knees and I'll still be forgiven
For what I've done

[Chorus: Ms. Dynamite & Elliphant]
Born in this world of sin
It's no money no love, no money no love
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
In case you wanna hear it again
It's no money no love, no money no love
(Yeah)
It's sure you love me now as the world is in my favor
Watch me while I disappear
No money no love

[Verse 2: Elliphant]
Vodoo I call when the world is closing in
Is it too late for me to be damned?
I give my last to be loved again
I cross my heart and clap for night
Can you say this dealer, have some mercy

[Pre-Chorus: Elliphant]
Maybe I should get down on my knees and I'll still be forgiven
For what I've done

[Chorus: Ms. Dynamite & Elliphant]
Born in this world of sin
It's no money no love, no money no love
(Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
In case you wanna hear it again
It's no money no love, no money no love
(Yeah)
It's sure you love me now as the world is in my favor
Watch me while I disappear
No money no love

[Outro]
No money no love, no money no love
