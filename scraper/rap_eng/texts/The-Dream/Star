Leaving the lives that have made us
A wish in our eyes as we go
Tomorrow will speak for us
Wanting today

Finding strength as we take hold
When time comes to reach for a star
How seemingly endless
And dark space can be

Look straight ahead through the blackness
So brilliant the light you will see
We've already chosen our direction
Standing our ground

While the clouds take us high
Some not as fortunate
Hearts still asleep
Can we stir their blood?
Can we teach them to fly?

Our elders have seen us grow strong
A wish of the past has proven to be us, vital
We keep them alive as we remain loyal
To our destiny

Vital star
A sanctum deep within our souls
Lights the way, reach within
You're not alone

This lifeblood flows inside us all
Infant dreams need full attention
Half a heart beats half as fast
Half as fast

Vital star
A sanctum deep within our souls
Lights the way, reach within
You're not alone
