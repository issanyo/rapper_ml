[Intro: The Dream]
I, I, I
I, I, I
Radio, radio, radio
Killah (killah)

[Verse 1: Jazmine Sullivan]
I bust the windows out your car
And thought it didn't mend my broken heart
I'll probably always have these ugly scars
But right now
I don't care about that part

I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you laying next to her
I didn't wanna
But I took my turn
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn't know that I had that much strength
But I'm glad you see what happens when

You see
You can't just play with people's feelings (I, I)
Tell them you love them
And don't mean it (I, I, I)
You'll probably say that it was juvenile (I, I, I)
But I think (I, I, I) that I (I, I, I) deserve to smile
(I, I, I)

[Verse 2: The Dream:]
Radio (radio)
Radio killah

Now, girl
You know you broke my heart (ay)
Not because you're gone
But what you did to my car
Now it's in the shop for the next two weeks
By then, you won't remember why you're mad at me

I didn't break your heart
(Shawty, I didn't break your heart)
This time, baby
You went too far (you went too far)
If you were to pull back the sheets (sheets)
You would've noticed that it wasn't me (ay)

Go ahead, apologize (go ahead, apologize)
I told you five times that I wasn't there
But you rather believe Keisha that told Tameka
And Camp and them
And they just mad cause I ain't sleeping with them

So, shawty
Get up in this biz (biz)
Are you crying or are those tears from the wind?
Cause you was acting foolish
Did you lose your mind?

Sure you bust the windows out
But you know cause you bust the one on your side
(Your side, your side)
Now you looking silly in the car (ca, ca, car)

You didn't trust me
And you didn't love me like I loved you
Whoa, oooh, whoa, oh, oh
But it's all right
And it's okay
Cause I was leaving anyways

Shawty
Shawty bust my windows out
Shawty bust my windows out
(But) That one on your side
(But that one)
On your side
Shawty bust my windows
