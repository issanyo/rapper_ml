Crazy girl
Crazy girl
Crazy girl
Crazy girl

Oh

I see you watchin'
I see you wantin' it
And now I'm testin' you
With every chance I get
I'm igniting you
Explosion
Can't deny the
Compulsion
Get ready, get set
On your runway jet

Get up on me, grind me faster
Tell me, baby, what you want
Lovin' how I throw this body
Know you wanna give me some
Careful baby
I am nothing like them other girls
I'll eat you up

Boy I'm a crazy girl
The kinda girl you might not wanna take to see your momma
Boy I am a crazy girl
If you fall for me prepare for a little drama
So you say you're ready
For a love that's so extreme
You want it, soon you will see
I'm a crazy girl

I'm love's anti-matter
Destroyer
Gotta work for this
Employer
Got you racing
Anticipating
What you wanna do to me
I'm a big risk, a bigger reward
But can you handle what you beggin' me for

Get up on me, grind me faster
Tell me, baby, what you want
Lovin' how I throw this body
Know you wanna give me some
Careful baby
I am nothing like them other girls
I'll eat you up

Boy I'm a crazy girl
The kinda girl you might not wanna take to see your momma
Boy I am a crazy girl
If you fall for me prepare for a little drama
So you say you're ready
For a love that's so extreme
You want it, soon you will see
I'm a crazy girl

Boy I'm a crazy girl
The kinda girl you might not wanna take to see your momma
Boy I am a crazy girl
If you fall for me prepare for a little drama
So you say you're ready
For a love that's so extreme
You want it, soon you will see
I'm a crazy girl
