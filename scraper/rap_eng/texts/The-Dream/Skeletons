Thought I needed your love
Thought I needed your favour
Thought I needed your follow
Dreams of being your favourite
Cut your slice of the pie
Take pieces of me
The taste is living out
Gonna spit it out
Ill never be your hero
I have too many flaws
No shining night in armour
Ill never be your star
Id rather be the darkness
Than to lie in the light..
Rather be the one you love
Than who you lie like you know my secrets
That makes you hold me
Offend me
Dont let
Simply exorcising demons
You never admit youre just like me
You know all of my secrets
That makes you holier than me
Dont let
What like a drug
Ive been feeling
When we know
We all
Have that
Closet full of skeletons
Never be what you want
And never tear right through your eyes
Seems I can't win for loosing
So why should I f*in try?
Dont ever strike a match
Dont ever light a fire
Hey Mr Stone thrower
Make sure you aim higher
See these ashes on my shoulder
I've survived fire before
So baby do what you please
So baby do what you do
Im not talking today
But tomorrow its you
You know my secrets
That makes you holier than me
Dont let
Simply exorcising demons
You never admit youre just like me
You know all of my secrets
That makes you holier than me
Dont let
What like a drug
I've been feeling
When we know
We all
Have that
Closet full of skeletons
All i ever wanted was to give you the real me!
None ever told me that being here was more like make belief!
All I ever wanted was your love. (x3)
