After tonight, tonight, tonight
I'ma be your favorite
All night, all night, all night, all night
I'ma be the one chasing
I'ma get on your stage and sing like a bird
And I'ma get on your page, baby, like a word
I'ma break it down
Oh, baby, baby, I'ma, I'ma turn you out
Just watch me and my love start to develop like a picture

Oh now, tame me, brace me, hold me down
That's it rough, soft, turn me around
Baby, I'm gonna do it till I've done it
And the next time they ask ya

You tell them that
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it, it's mine
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it, boy, you know
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it, it's mine
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it, oh, oh

Alright, alright, alright, alright
Gimme what you got an I'ma take it
Tell me what you gonna do when I'm all up on you
Won't fight, won't fight, won't fight, won't fight
Shawty won't you go ahead and break it
Baby get up on it show me that you want it
In the kitchen, in the hallway, up on the sofa
Got me pop, pop, pop, pop, poppin this thing like a toaster
Lift off into the sky, and exit earth
And let this ATLien give you what you deserve
Now baby c'mon

Tame me, brace me, hold me down
That's it rough, soft, turn me around
Baby, I'm gonna do it till I've done it
And the next time they ask ya

You tell them that
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it, it's mine
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it, boy, you know
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it, it's mine
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it (tell me)

How does it feel?
Do you like when I do this to you?
How does it feel?
I know you like when I do it to you
It's yours, It's mine
You can get it every day
All day, all night
You can get it every way
How does it feel?
I know you like when I do this to you

You tell them that
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it, it's mine
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it (yes I do)
Boy, you know
I run it (you know) [x2]
I run it, it's mine
I run it (you know) [x2]
