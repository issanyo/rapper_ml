(Vs.1)
Why do we go through things unnecessary
Why can't we understand that our love is the key
We can solve any problem if we only were meek
But you won't take the time to try and understand me
Our Love

(Bridge)
Our love will grow much stronger
(grow much stronger)
Our love will last much longer (last)
If we would take the time out
To find out what love is all about

That's why I'm saying

(Chorus)
I wanna get to know you better (only if you let me)
Only if you let me
Love will grow much faster
Happy ever after
That is what I'm after
I just wanna be with you, you

(Vs.2)
I do not understand why we can't make it
But I will tell you one thing
I'm not trying to fake it
You can stay if you want to
Cause my love is the same
I will not disappoint you
And I won't be the blame
Our love

(Bridge)
That is why I'm sayin'

(Chorus)
La la la la la la (la la la la la la la)
La la la la la la (whoa laaa)
La la la la la la (la la la)
La la la la la la (la la)

(Chorus until fade)
