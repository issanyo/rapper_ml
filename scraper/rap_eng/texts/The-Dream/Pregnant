[Hook: R. Kelly]
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)
Pregnant (knock you up)

[R. Kelly]
Now, usually I leave the club with a girl who has a man
And take her to the hotel for just a one night stand
See I'm a playa so I ain't tryna take her on no dates
But much like my Patron man, I'm just tryna take it straight
Until I met this girl in the club with an unbelievable booty
Sweetest girl in the world on me and on top of that she's a cutie
I ain't seen nothing like her around here in a while
And if I had a girl she'd be the one to bear my child
Telling myself I'm a player so I keep tryna shake it off
But I keep on seeing this big old house with a picket fence and a dog
Never felt nothing like this, she's more than a mistress
I'm bout to handle my business, the put that girl in my kitchen

[Hook]
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant
(oh, that's what I told her)
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant
(woo, woo, woo)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant,(knock you up)
Pregnant
(Knock you up)

[Tyrese]
Now, all the pretty ladies please line up right next to me
How would you like to go on a little trip with your boy Tyrese
Raise your hand if you want me to fulfill your fantasies
I can have you co-staring, in one of my movies
Tell me what your name is, I can make you famous
We can pop champagne and, and get right down to sexing
Now I ain't got nothing to do, tonight I got away from my crew
I just wanna put something in you
And I can tell that you want it too (ay-ay-ay-ay-ay)
Ay (Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay) and I'm rea-a-a-ady babe
And your rea-a-a-ady babe
So come on ladies, let's get up out of this club
Kells, Dream, and 'Rese afterparty, come and fuck with us

[Hook + Plus Tyrese]
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant
(You make me wanna)
Girl you make me wanna get you pregnant
(Get you pregnant)
Lay your body down and get you pregnant (knock you up)

[Robin Thicke]
Oh this song has got me hungry baby, baby
So tell me that you want me baby, baby
And Girl I’ll love you till the sun shines (sun shines)
And girl I promise I will make you mine
Around the world in and out of clubs hanging out chicks
And I don’t see nothing wrong with having a kid
Ooh, ooh, sounds like heaven’s calling us
Ooh, ooh, and girl well that’s bout making love
If you chose me I guarantee
That the rest of your life would be, man drama free
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I think bo-oth of us should leave this clu-u-ub
And get somewhere alone with me
Where there’s no phones to ring, and plant this magic seed

[Hook + Robin Thicke]

[The-Dream]
Your house my house don’t matter hit it up
Your city my city don’t matter give it up
Something about being with you makes me wanna a baby
Put them pills on chill and girl give me my baby
You can play all you want but I know you feel it to
For 3 weeks you’ve been talking bout extra bed rooms
In New York meeting with the realtor
There’s something you want to tell just say it I’ll kay it
Oh girl I'mma take care of you
And I'mma still hold ya like we brand new
So don’t get it twisted for 30 something weeks
I’m still gon' hit it and baby sit it, baby sit it

See I’m not cheap, or selfish babe
Girl I’m just thirsting for that booty baby
And it’s all your fault baby you look so good
It’s all your fault that it feels like wood
And you look so bored up in this club so let’s go
We can hop in the Lamborghini roll to my big club
Ba-a-a-aby (shorty) let's go-o crazy
Ohh let’s ma-a-a-ake a l-ittle Kelly
Baby I’ve got goodies and I want you to have some
All I ask is that you let me explore your secret garden
