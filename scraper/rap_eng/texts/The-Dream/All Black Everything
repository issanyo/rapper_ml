Get up in this bed, come up out them clothes
Black Fendi curtains, black marble on the floor
Baby let me watch it, give me a show
Black lingerie, shorty get it on
Now come up out that black hoody
Out them black designer jeans
Out them black shades
Come get it babe, come get it babe
Now come up out my black Jesus piece
My black Audemars
It's black everywhere we are
And you're the star
Black everything, black, black everything
Not just the car, but everywhere we are
And you're the star
Black everything, black, black everything
Not just the car, but everywhere we are
You know I miss it, girl you know I love it
Know I want to kiss it, I can't wait to hug it
Do you in a Maybach, black suede, black fur
Lose you in the back seat, black diamonds, black purse
And we so hood certified rock stars
Keep it looking good, put it on my black card
And put a run in your black style heels
Sweat the eyeliner out, apply it again
Can't wait to get that black skirt up in my crib
Can't wait to get you out them Givenchy heels
Ace of Spades sipping, this is how we live, yeah
Now come up out that black hoody
Out them black designer jeans
Out them black shades
Come get it babe, come get it babe
Now come up out my black Jesus piece
My black Audemars
It's black everywhere we are
And you're the star
Black everything, black, black everything
Not just the car, but everywhere we are
And you're the star
Black everything, black, black everything
Not just the car, but everywhere we are
Jet black hair falling down her back
All up on her Baby Phat like trains on a track
I'mma hit it like crack, I'm fiending
She on the black roller coaster straight screaming
Lip syncing on my microphone, still got my fitted on
Sidenote, you should download this as your ringtone
Back to the black linen, h-h-h-hell no
Shorty I ain't finished, y-y-y-yeah, y'all
Riding it like a black Ducati, baby
She in my ear like boy you got me, baby
We Ace of Spades sipping, this is how we live, yeah
Now come up out that black hoody
Out them black designer jeans
Out them black shades
Come get it babe, come get it babe
Now come up out my black Jesus piece
My black Audemars
It's black everywhere we are
And you're the star
Not just a car, but everywhere we are
And you're the star
