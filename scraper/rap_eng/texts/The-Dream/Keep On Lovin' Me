[Intro: Cassie & The-Dream]
Ah ah ah ah, The Dream
Ah ah ah ah, I'm with my girl Cassie
Ah ah ah ah, the American Dreamer
Ah ah ah ah, with my girl Cassie

[Verse 1: Cassie]
Every time I turn around I hear something about you
All my girls telling me about the bad things you do
Everybody all up in my Louis bag
Ain't talking bout this, they talkin' bout that
And they ain't gon' stop up until they break us... in two
But you have my love and I have yours
Let them keep talkin' I ain't ever leaving, baby I believe in you

[Chorus: The-Dream & Both]
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me

[Verse 2: The-Dream, Cassie & Both]
I'm tired of feeling wrong when I know that we're right (I know we're right)
Why should I give a **** I'm tired of being nice (Being nice)
See, I ain't leaving her (oh no) and she ain't leaving me (No-no)
So get used to it (used to it) cause it's how it's gon' be
It seems like the whole world know what this is (Break us up to a point where we can't fix this)
You don't know my love (don't know my love), they can't judge us

[Chorus: The-Dream & Both]
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me

[Bridge: Both]
Just keep on loving me, me me m-me me me
Just keep on loving me, me me me (I love you baby) me me
(Mwah) Just keeping on loving me-ee (Mwah) Me-ee (Mwah) Me-ee (Mwah) Me-ee (Take it back to the ATL, yeh)

[Chorus: The-Dream & Both]
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
There's something wrong with the world, just keep on loving me

[Outro: The-Dream]
There's nothin' wrong with you, there's nothin' wrong with me
Something's wrong with the world
There's nothin' wrong with you or me
There's something wrong with the world you see
There's nothin' wrong with you or me
There's something wrong with the world we see
There's something wrong with you or me
There's something wrong with the world
There's something wrong with the world
(There's something wrong with the world) Eh eh eh eh eh
There's something wrong with the world
(There's something wrong with the world) Eh eh eh eh eh
There's something wrong with the world...
