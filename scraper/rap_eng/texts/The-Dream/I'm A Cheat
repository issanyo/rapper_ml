The good girl in me is all gone
Ring the bell
She ain't home (she ain't home)
And this new girl in me so strange (so strange)
I used to be love it, love it (now)
Everything's changed

And now you
You saying you can do, do
Whatever the other man's failed to do, do
I can hear you clear like a wireless network (network)
Not have no problems with affection
Cause this is how I address it

I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
He had a problem with affection
I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
This is how I address it

I'm a cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat
I'm a cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat
I'm a cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat
I'm a cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat

All cheaters, y'all
No ain't cheaters
I can grantee like I'm no other cheater
All cheaters, y'all
No ain't cheaters
I can grantee like I'm no other cheater

Ain't it sad that you gave me your best
Cause your best was just like the rest
Crying rivers trying me don't fly
My eyes drier then a Las Vegas sky

It was you
You said that you gonn' do, do
What every other man failed to do, do
Your just another dropped clone in my network
He had a problem with affection
And this is how I address it

I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
He had a problem with affection
I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
This is how I address it

I'm a cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat
I'm a cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat
I'm a cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat
I'm a cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat, cheat

All cheaters, y'all
No ain't cheaters
I can grantee like I'm no other cheater
All cheaters, y'all
No ain't cheaters
I can grantee like I'm no other cheater

Yves saint Laurent stacks in my bag
Hit the club fly twenny threes on the jag
You know I'm on the throne
You know I'm on the yacht
Me and my girls posting in the back

Watch me do my 2 step
Yep, get my drink on
First my girl going to point them out
Then I get my freak on
All up on this guy
Shawty you know why
Now you can go 'head and ki-ki-kiss my ass goodbye

I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
He had a problem with affection
I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
I'm a cheat yey
This is how I address it

I'm a cheat
I'm a cheat
I'm a cheat
I'm a cheat

All cheaters, y'all
No ain't cheaters
I can grantee like I'm no other cheater
All cheaters, y'all
No ain't cheaters
I can grantee like I'm no other cheater

Watch me do my two-steps
Yep, get my drink out
First my girls going to point them out
Then I get my freak on
