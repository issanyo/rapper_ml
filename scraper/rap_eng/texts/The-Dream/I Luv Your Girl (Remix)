[Intro: Young Jeezy]
Oh he bought you that watch?
He's such a nice guy he's so generous
Ha ha ha!
You sucka ass nigga you!
Let's go nigga

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
It goes Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama
I made the world Trap Or Die ask DJ Drama
It goes free Big Meech and motherfuck Osama
He ain't talkin' 'bout nothin' so what's up lil' mama
I think ya girl want me; if she don't she should
3 or 4 blunts'll make the sex so good (whew)
I just fill 'em so fast we just blow 'em so fast
Before I even know it we don' blew a whole half
Young come through night time like a burglar
Type a nigga leave a skully on while he servin' ya
Type a nigga take a phone call while he servin' ya
So what he at the back door
What you think I'm strapped for?

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
We up in the club (club)
I see her do her thang (thang)
You might wanna rap (rap)
But she'll make you sing (sing)
I was on her (her)
She was on him (him)
She all up on my thang man my thang on her hip (hip)
She ATL poppin' (pop)
Don't know how to act (act)
She left for one song (song)
And came right back (back)
Grindin' on me (me)
The rest of the night (night)
Her man start muggin' (muggin)
He could see it in my eye

[Hook: The-Dream]
Lil' mama so hood, (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keeps them heels on high, (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty roll (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty go, go, go (I love your girl)
I'm sorry I got in for your girlfriend

[Bridge: The-Dream]
She run her fingers through her hair, he tryna call her over there
But she like, "Fuck that nigga"
She drop it down to the floor, I'm like shorty you should go
But she like, "Fuck that nigga"
Call it envy, I want her on me
All up in my head, and now she in my bed
I, I, I, I

[Verse 2 - The-Dream]
Me and lil' shorty in the back (back)
Talkin' bout this (this)
Talkin' bout that (that)
Got her on Patron ('tron)
She actin' all bad (bad)
Girl chose me. Don't be mad
Kelly told y'all don't bring 'em in the club
The way she rock that, got the boy in love
And I pray that y'all ain't serious, cause seriously shes on my dick

[Hook: The-Dream]
Lil' mama so hood, (I love your girl)

The American Dream
Usually, you won't see me hate
On another dude
Ma got me up in here willing to separate you
From ya boo

Plus I just found out that it's her birthday
