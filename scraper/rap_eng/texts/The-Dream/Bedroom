[Intro]
Calling all bodies to the bedroom

[Chorus 1]
I'm calling all the bodies to the bedroom
I know all the trappers, I know all the rappers
They who you see in the club, and I'm who you fuck after
Calling all bodies to the bedroom (To the bedroom)

[Verse 1]
All ladies read before 11
So you got all day to get your motherfuckin' nails done
Know you soak that pussy 'round 7
And it's already 4, go get your motherfuckin' hair done
Ooh, you look so sexy
Come and bless me
When you out the club, baby, text me
I'ma pull up with them jetskis
After you grind that and wind that, girl, bring it on to me

[Chorus 1]
Calling all bodies to the bedroom (Calling all bodies, calling all bodies)
I'm calling all bodies to the bedroom (Calling all bodies, calling all bodies)
I know all the trappers, I know all the rappers
They who you see in the club, and I'm who you fuck after
Calling all bodies to the bedroom (Calling all bodies, calling all bodies)

[Verse 2]
I see that look in your eye (Your eye)
I know just what it's sayin' (Ooh, girl I)
There's another place you need to be
Every Thursday night, same shit, same bottle service
30 niggas' intersection, makin' bitches nervous
When it could be me and you together like weave and glue
(Hold up, is that still a thing?)

[Chorus 2]
Calling all bodies to the bedroom (Calling all bodies, calling all bodies)
I'm calling all bodies to the bedroom (I'm calling all bodies, calling all bodies)
I know all the trappers, down with all the rappers
I'm the one you see before the club and the one you come fuck after, baby
Calling all bodies to the bedroom (Calling all bodies, calling all bodies)

[Bridge]
Hoo-hoo, whoo-hoo, whoo-hoo
Girl, come and fix your life
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo hoo-hoo
Come the morning light, yeah
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo
Call me up (Call me up)
Hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo, hoo-hoo
'Cause I'm on ya ('Cause I'm on ya)
Girl I'm gon' fix your life (Fix your life)
Even if it takes all night (Takes all night)
Call me up
Ooh, betcha got a nigga on me

[Outro]
Ooh, you look so sexy
Come and bless me
When you out the club, baby, text me
I'ma pull up with them jetskis
After you grind that and wind that, girl, bring it on to me
Ooh, you look so sexy
Come and bless me
When you out the club, baby, text me
I'ma pull up with them jetskis
After you grind that and wind that, girl, bring it on to me
