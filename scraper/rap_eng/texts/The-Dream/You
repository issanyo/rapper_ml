[Verse 1]
That body's automatic
See it clear, no static
Pull over, no traffic
Bring it back like elastic
Caught in LA like Aladdin
Colliding your love with my passion
Providing your love with compassion
Subsiding this love would be tragic

[Chorus]
You got the wrong nigga starin' at you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You got the wrong nigga starin' at you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You got the wrong nigga lovin' on you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You got the wrong nigga huggin' on you
Girl, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You got the wrong nigga starin' at you (You got the)
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (Wrong brother)
You got the wrong nigga starin' on you (You got the)
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (Heartbreaker)
You got the wrong nigga huggin' on you (Don't hurt her)
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (Live better)
You got the wrong nigga huggin' on you (Don't hurt her)
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, ayy (Ayy)

[Verse 2]
You got that thing automatic
You got that thing that stop traffic
You just appear here like magic
I swear your old boy don't want static

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with you
But I don't know for sure
You guarantee me your love
And I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
You got the wrong nigga starin' at you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You got the wrong nigga lovin' on you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You got the wrong nigga huggin' on you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
You got the wrong nigga thuggin' on you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you

[Bridge]
Tell your girlfriends you've gone
We'll bring you home to the coast at morn
Let's do it right now, stop wasting time
Could be coolin' right now, don't waste the sun
Tell your girlfriends you've gone
We'll bring you home to the coast at morn
Let's do it right now, stop wasting time
Could be coolin' right now, don't waste the sun

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm in love with you
But I don't know for sure
You guarantee me your love
And I'll never let you go

[Chorus]
You got the wrong nigga starin' at you (You got that)
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (Run back, back)
You got the wrong nigga starin' on you (You got that)
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (Hard breather)
You got the wrong nigga lovin' on you (Don't hurt her)
You, you, you, you, you, you, you (Live better)
You got the wrong nigga thuggin' on you (Don't hurt her)
You, you, you, you, you, you, you
