[Verse 1]
I wanna be whatever you want me to be
Oh, oh yeah baby
Hooked up to your love
I'll be whatever you need
Oh, oh yeah baby
Down pillows surrounding my head
I'm wrapped up in this bed
See i'mma comfort ya like a comforter
Tonight your love's a home and I'm your furniture

[Chorus]
After this you'll see
There ain't no one like me
I got that (supersonic ooh naa)
And just when you think that it's over
Won't let you get no sleep
I got (supersonic ooh naa)
I got that fire truck siren (roooroo)
I got that knock out love (throw in the towel)
After this you'll see
There ain't no one like me
I got that (supersonic ooh naa)

[Post-Chorus]
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Right, alright, alright, alright, alright
Right, alright, alright, alright, alright
Right, alright, alright, alright, alright

Texting
Meet me at my place, I'm texting back

Now she all up on blackberry, Texting
Dot...dot dot dot. Smiley face
You on mine, I'm on yours
Back and forth
Kissing you from your forehead
Down to your toes

So put this in yo blog, I'm the shit
See I can forget sarah marshall, But she can't forget me

And I don't mean to sound impartial
But there ain't nothing like me

I got that knock out love (throw in the towel)
So listen to me c. mili
Ain't nothing like me you'll see (supersonic ooh naa)
And if you ain't heard you need to go cop my shit
Baby, all I wanna do
Is place your body up on the moon
Anything you want girl I will do...

[Chorus]
After this you'll see
There ain't no one like me

And just when you think that it's over
Won't let you get no sleep
I got (supersonic ooh naa)
I got that fire truck siren (roooroo)
I got that knock out love (throw in the towel)
After this you'll see
There ain't no one like me
I got that (supersonic ooh naa)

Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
Right, alright, alright, alright, alright
Right, alright, alright, alright, alright
