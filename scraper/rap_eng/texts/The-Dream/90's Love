[Intro]
Contra, Contra

[Verse 1]
Girl, come and make love to your nigga
Feel that touch from your nigga
Held by your nigga
If you care for a nigga

Instagram pics of ass all day
But that ain't love
We ain't trending
They'll never see us on the blogs
Baby, that ain't us
What we got is that down-for-a-nigga
Get-clipped-do-a-year-still-around-for-a-nigga shit
We ain't gotta chase love
Baby, let it chase us

[Chorus]
So get on over here
Let me lay under that soft body
Can't wait to lay into that
When I'm on top of that soft body
Always missing that
Don't mind kissing that soft body
You everywhere with that
I'm everywhere in that soft body

[Bridge]
Now, let me body this, let me body this
I'ma body this, I'ma body this
Baby, let me body this, let me body this
I'm about to body this, let me body this

[Verse 2]
So come and fuck with a nigga
Shawty, come and put your trust in a real nigga
Bring your little body over here, baby, baby, baby, come on
Ain't no lying in my songs
I know a G when I see one
You know a G when you see one
Sip-sippin' on that Seagram's
Straight ridin' 'round this bitch with this young phenom, ??
We got that 90s love
That thing that make your girls hate us
Make niggas look at us in disgust
But still they wonder and have to discuss
Two minutes and forty seconds in
My lover, my mothafuckin' friend
Look at what you made me do
Extended verse two, and missed the beat section for you

[Chorus]
So get on over here
Let me lay under that soft body
Can't wait to lay into that
When I'm on top of that soft body
Always missing that
Don't mind kissing that soft body
You everywhere with that
I'm everywhere in that soft body

[Bridge]
Now, let me body this, let me body this
I'ma body this, I'ma body this
Baby, let me body this, let me body this
I'm about to body this, let me body this
