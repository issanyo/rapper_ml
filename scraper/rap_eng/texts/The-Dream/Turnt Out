Let's make out on the phone first
You're my bakery, where's my dessert?
Shorty bring it home, you know flirt
Just got off at five, now it's back to work

Your second job is waiting on you
This is exactly why them girls be hatin' on you
You get up on it, look back at it
Turn tricks on it, silly rabbit

Push up on it, chest down
Close your legs, turn 'round
I ain't never ever, ever burned down
I'm a beast

And I'ma do ya' 'til you're all turnt out
I'ma do ya' 'til you're all turnt out
Girl, I'ma do ya' 'til you're all turnt out
I'ma do ya' 'til you're all turnt out

Now all I need is just a fraction
In just a little bit I'll have you ready for action
Endless satisfaction
Got her open like a [Incomprehensible]

Full of love girl pour it out
She's a mess, ah so
Always leave me on a high note
She's a beast

She got me all turnt out
She got me all turnt out
She got me all turnt out
She got me all turnt out

Shorty got a nigga all crazy, cape on
Whenever I need savin', she on
Ridin' it out like baby, baby
My bad I meant to say baby, baby

Goodnight, good mornin'
Let's do it again, get over here woman
I poached her up, then I coached her up
And now she's a beast

And we do it 'til we're all turnt out
Yeah, we do it 'til we're all turnt out
Yeah, we do it 'til we're all turnt out
We do it 'til we're all turnt out
We do it 'til we're all turnt out

Yeah, yessir, yessir, that's my nigga' right there
Uh, yessir, uh, yessir, that's my nigga' right there
Uh, yessir, uh, yessir, that's my nigga' right there
