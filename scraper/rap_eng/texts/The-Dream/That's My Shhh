[Intro]
She likes, she likes, she likes
She likes, she likes, she likes
That's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
That's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit (yeah, Jason Derulo)

[Verse 1]
Now get on over here and get up on this bed
I'm all up on you, now lock me in with your legs
Pulled your shirt to the left and kissed that one
Pulled your shirt to the right, how did I miss that one?
I really want it but I love it that you're teasing it
Once I start I ain't gon' stop until I'm pleasing it
Almost time to come up out them jeans
Huh, you know exactly what I mean uh

[Pre-Chorus]
As we take it from the bed to the floor
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa
If you're ready, say you're ready and you'll see
First one's coming by the time you count to three

[Chorus]
One, like a teacher, you're sending me to the corner
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an all on ya
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
One, I can feel it coming down
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Oh, baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
Hey, referee, I think we're ready for round two
Stay right there, I'll come to you
Just relax while I analyze your tattoos
Tryna see where I'ma put my name on your back, boo
Just when you thought the waterpark couldn't get no wetter
I'm dripping down a back, like I'm doing it in my sweater
Rise above the oven, cream on the cupcake
Hazelnut flavored, Haagen Dazs milkshake

[Pre-Chorus]
As we take it from the bed to the floor
From the washer, to the dryer to the sofa
If you're ready, say you're ready and you'll see
First one's coming by the time you count to three

[Chorus]
One, like a teacher, you're sending me to the corner
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an all on ya
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
One, I can feel it coming down
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit (four, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Bridge]
Nobody-body is listening, let it go
'Cause I wanna hear you sing, baby, sing
Somebody-body better turn on the radio
'Cause I wanna hear you sing, baby, sing
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Oh, baby, yeah, woah-oh, woah-oh

[Chorus]
One, like a teacher, you're sending me to the corner (woo)
Two, grabbing and biting while I'm an all on ya
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit
One, I can feel it coming down
Two, grabbing on your head, turn the thing around
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit (oh, baby)
Three, that's my shit, that's my shit, that's my shit (oh, baby, that's when you're singing like)
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah (that's when you're singing like)
Woah-oh, woah-oh, woah-oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Huh, that's my shit
