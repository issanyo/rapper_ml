[Intro]
That girl wear fancies
That girl is fancy
Don't know, yeah, live fancy
All night girl, I live fancy

[Verse 1]
Through the sheets
She climbs her way up to this bed singing melodies
Run my fingers in her hair and say come to me
First there is a no, then she says, "Yes baby"
She’s the dream of a billion men
Go girl (haa haa)
Go girl (aah haa)

[Pre Chorus]
See she made her way from nothing
Can’t fault her for wanting something
She loves men that can afford (yea)
She wants to
Live fancy

[Chorus]
Trips to Monaco, designer names from head to toe (live fancy)
On planes that fly clean across the roaming skies (live fancy)
Brilliant cars, spend evenings among the stars (live fancy)
Diamond rings
All those things
Live fancy
Live fancy
Live fancy
Live fancy

[Verse 2]
She spends her time
Aboard yachts, if not, somewhere tasting wine
In Paris seducing me while we dine
She’s only 23, but ahead of her time
She’s the Dream of a billion men
Go Girl

[Pre Chorus]
See she made her way from nothing
Can’t fault her for wanting something
She loves men that can afford (yea)
She wants to
Live fancy

[Chorus]
Trips to Monaco, designer names from head to toe (live fancy)
On planes that fly clean across the roaming skies (live fancy)
Brilliant cars, spend evenings among the stars (live fancy)
Diamond rings
All those things
Live fancy
Live fancy
Live fancy
Live fancy

[Verse 3]
Cause of me all she do, is walk around in Italian shoes
She’s probably a girl you used to know
I can see her beauty with both eyes closed
But you didn’t notice she fell in love with what she noticed
That I’m fancy

[Chorus]
Trips to Monaco, designer names from head to toe (live fancy)
On planes that fly clean across the roaming skies (live fancy)
Brilliant cars, spend evenings among the stars (live fancy)
Diamond rings
All those things
Live fancy
Live fancy
Live fancy
Live fancy

[Verse 3]
You can be from the hood, but I know you wanna live fancy
(Shawty throw your hands up)
East Side, West Side, South Side but you wanna live fancy
(If you fly, know you're fly)
She’s with me, cause she wanna live (fancy)
(Anything she want I will provide her)
I’m with her, because she’s beautiful
(And you know I can't deny her)
And deserving
Oh yeah
(You know how we live)
She’s deserving (Uh huh, you know how we live)
Oh yeah (All we- spend, spend this mo-mo-money)

[Break]
Eh eh-eh, eh oh eh eh-oh
(You- You You know how we live)
Oh-oh eh eh-eh, eh oh-oh eh eh-oh
(You- You You know how we live)
*All we do, we spend this money
*All we do, we spend this money
*All we do, we spend this money
ATL, ATL ATL

[Verse 4]
She all on me cause all I do is ride around the Bentley coupe
Got no need, she got me, buying her them Fendi shoes
All we do is shop until we drop, right there in the floor
All we do is make love in foreign places 'til we can't no more
They say you can’t buy love, man they lying
If Christian LaCroix brings a smile, I’ll buy it
She wanna make love on the edge of the world, I’ll buy it
Have anything she want cause she my girl, say it, she got it
I'm flyer than flying in G-0 jets
On First class, coach class no disrespect
At my New York apartment to JFK
On the helicopter just the pilots goin' my way
I’m worldly swerving in Bentley whips
Don’t even have to watch how I spend my chips, no
Dollars to Euros, I’m every nigga’s hero
Cause even when I used to rock Polo I was fancy
