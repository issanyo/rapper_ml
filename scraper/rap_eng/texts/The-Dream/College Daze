[Hook]
I forgot about them things you did in college
Can you forget about them things I did last night?
And you can call it what you wanna call it
But I hope we had this fight for the last time
Girl why you make me promise it's the last time?
When you feel in your heart it ain't the last time
It ain't gon' get no better than you
It ain't gon' get no better than me

[Post]
I hope we had this fight for the last time
I hope we've had this fight for the last time

[Verse]
Why all the bad girls wanna be good when they get to you?
Only when they get to you
They get to you
Why all the bad girls wanna turn good when they get to you?
When they get to you
When they get to you

[B-Section]
Girl even though I knew you used to fuck around with Ye
Still I made you honest
Baby I made you my bae
I knew about your sophomore years up in Follies
0 12 down in Tootsies where you grew into your body
Friday in Miami
Weekends in Atlanta
Western Union money to your mama in Savannah
And still I never asked you how you got your first Benz
After bands, after bands, after bands since when

I hope we had this fight for the last time
Just want you, baby, just need you, baby
I hope we've had this fight for the last time
I just want you, baby, just need you, baby
