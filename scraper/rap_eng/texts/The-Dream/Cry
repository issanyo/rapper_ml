Oh yeah

[Verse 1:]
Girl you
You have done something to me
I can't but snooze
You have me handcuffed to your heart
And it's true

I feel nothing
Unless I'm by you
Girl!
Yeah

Something in my stomach starts to flicker
When you are around
Something in my soul
Starts jumping
Whenever you come around

And I will
Neva, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Let you down
No no!

And I will
Neva, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
Dissatisfy you I'll only stand by you

So girl I'm!
Putting these words in the air
And hopefully
When I wake up in the morning
I've got faith
That you'll be right there

[Hook:]
Cause all the ones before told you they loved you
But I'm telling you
I really fucking love you girl!

And all the ones before have told you
You were beautiful
But I really think your fucking beautiful girl

And all the ones before
Said that they would take care of you
But I really wanna take care of you girl

House, Car girl whatever!
Just put ME and YOU together

Want this so bad
And I don't know why
But I'm sure if u don't have me I'll
Cry [x26]
I'll cry

[Verse 2:]
Now baby can u please listen to me
I may not have the perfect life
Or big blue eyes
But what I got
Is deeper than the sea

Yeah!

But what I'm willing to give you
A million men in the world
Wouldn't give you
If they had it
To give for free

Are you listening to me
Woman!
Now I can't lie
I know I can have any man in the world, world
I can't lie
You would really be doing me justice
To be my girl

But don't get it twisted!
I'm a man in my own words
And in time, you will find out
That I'm exactly what you deserve

[Hook:]
Cause all the ones before told you they loved you
But I'm telling you
I really fucking love you girl!

And all the ones before have told you
You were beautiful
But I really think your fucking beautiful girl

And all the ones before
Said that they would take care of you
But I really wanna take care of you girl

House, Car girl whatever!
Just put ME and YOU together

Want this so bad
And I don't know why
But I'm sure if u don't have me
I'll Cry [x26]
I'll cry
I'm pretty sure of it

[Verse 3:]
I could see the water flowing down my face
Like a river
I'm pretty sure of it
Oh
And every time I think about it
I just start to shiver
I'm pretty sure of it
That I, I will die on this day
If you don't take my girl!
I'm pretty sure of it
I'm pretty sure of it
Baby baby
Please have me in your world

I want this so bad
And I don't know why
But I'm sure if you don't have me
I'll Cry [x26]
I'll Cry
