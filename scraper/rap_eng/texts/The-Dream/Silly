SILLY OF ME TO THINK THAT I COULD EVER HAVE YOU FOR MY GUY
HOW I LOVE YOU... HOW I WANT YOU...
SILLY OF ME TO THINK THAT YOU COULD EVER REALLY WANT ME TOO
HOW I LOVE YOU...

YOU'RE JUST A LOVER OUT TO SCORE AND
I KNOW THAT I SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR MORE
WHAT COULD IT BE IN YOU I SEE
WHAT COULD IT BE...
OH, LOVE, OH, LOVE, STOP MAKING A FOOL OF ME
OH, LOVE, OH, LOVE, STOP MAKING A FOOL OF ME

SILLY OF ME TO THINK THAT YOU COULD EVER KNOW THE THINGS I DO
ARE ALL DONE FOR YOU...ONLY FOR YOU
SILLY OF ME TO TAKE THE TIME TO COMB MY HAIR AND POUR THE WINE
AND KNOW YOU'RE NOT THERE

YOU'RE JUST A LOVER OUT TO SCORE
AND I KNOW THAT I SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR MORE
WHAT COULD IT BE IN YOU I SEE
WHAT COULD IT BE...
OH, LOVE, OH, LOVE, STOP MAKING A FOOL OF ME
OH, LOVE, OH, LOVE, STOP MAKING A FOOL OF ME

OOH

SILLY OF ME TO GO AROUND AND BRAG ABOUT THE LOVE I FOUND
AND SAY YOU'RE THE BEST, WELL, I CANT TELL THE REST
AND FOOLISH OF ME TO TELL THEM ALL THAT EVERY NIGHT AND DAY YOU CALL
WHEN YOU COULD CARE LESS
