We are born with wings to fly
Sometimes we can't reach that high
Cause it feels like the sky is falling down
Against the odds, against the rain
You dig your heels in to slow that train
So many wishes in the lost and found
One little thing can turn it all around
Holding on to a dream
Trying to keep hope alive
You can reach out to me
You can reach down deep inside
When the whole worlds gone insane
A ray of light remains the days you know it seems
Sometimes the hardest thing is
Holding on to a dream
At times you win, at times you lose
Sometimes life puts a rock in your shoe
Something in you keeps you walking on
Leave the fear and doubt in the past
Just believe and dont look back
Holding on to a dream
Trying to keep hope alive
You can reach out to me
You can reach down deep inside
When the whole worlds gone insane
A ray of light remains, these days you know it seems
Sometimes the hardest thing is
Holding on to a dream
It feels like an endless fight
All up hill, but thats all right, oh yeah
When the whole worlds gone insane
A ray of light remains these days you know it seems
Sometimes the hardest thing is
Holding on to a dream
These days you know it seems
Sometimes the hardest thing is
Holding on to a dream
