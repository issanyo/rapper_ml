[Intro]
Say I'm fucked up
Well, you just might be fucked up too
I might be fucked up
Well baby girl, how about you?

[Verse 1: The Dream]
You used to be my nigga
You used to be that cool bitch
You used to smoke wit' a nigga
But now you on that bullshit
You used to sex me crazy
You used to call me baby
Now all you do it nag me like a 5 year old from the backseat
You used to be so confident
But all that shit came and went
Used to be anti-internet
But now you constantly blogging and shit!

You used to strip for a nigga
Now you ain't got nothing but lip for a nigga
Halfway decent for me, but you dress up for your girlfriends?
Listening to what they say got your ass without a husband
Put you up in a Benz, you did everything to get me
Ain't did nothing since but keep talking about what it should be
Car note, daycare, paid all the fucking rent
Know you wanna run the world
But first, try running this
But yall don't hear me, oh, oh, oh

[Hook (x2): The Dream]
Stop fucking with me, woman
Stop fucking with me, woman
Stop fucking with me, woman
Stop fucking with me if you ain't fucking with me

[Verse 2: Casha]
You used to be my nigga
Way back when you didn't have shit
Staying out with your niggas
And always on some bullshit
I stopped my life for you nigga
To become a wife for you nigga
All up in that strippers face begging for ass you'll never have
All out of place lookin for something you already had
Used to want to touch me
Used to couldn't wait to fuck me
But took my pussy back
Cause it's obvious you never loved me
Texting and shit
Claiming you don't know her
Fuck up out of here nigga no breakfast you on the sofa
No lawyer let it burn
I wish I could leave your ass
Soon as I get my returns
I promise I'mma leave your ass
I can give a fuck about this '96 Benz
Swear I wouldn't give a fuck if it wasn't for these kids
Stop talking for I end up walking up out this bitch
No other girl would put up with your shit
So stop...hold up wait a minute
We ain't finished 'til I'm finished
All up under your mama whenever there's drama
Putting her two cents in it
Mamas boy man up I wouldn't even be tripping
If you ran this house like you run your fucking mouth
What the fuck you doing on twitter?
Grown ass nigga
I swear you be on them blogs
You need to be at your job
And I would get my hair and my motherfucking nails done
But you know like I know
I keep these motherfucking lights on

[Hook (x2): Casha]
Stop fucking with me, nigga
Stop fucking with me, nigga
Stop fucking with me, nigga
Stop fucking with me if you ain't fucking with me
