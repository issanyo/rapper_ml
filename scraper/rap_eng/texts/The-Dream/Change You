[Verse]
Remember how this started?
You and me, ecstasy, up in this club
On that wave
Remember how this started?
You and me and your friends, fuckin' around all night
Oh, didn't that feel alright?
Good times, good liquor
The three of us, you kissed her
No pressure, no lecture
Protection of affection

[Chorus]
Now don't let this dick change you
And I won't let that pussy change me
Ooh, ooh, ooh, uh
Don't let this dick change you
And I won't let that pussy change me
Ooh

[Post-Chorus]
Don't wait 'til you get to that nigga you gon' be with for the rest of your life (Life)
I know the fear can have you tight (Tight)
Now that you got something that you like (Like)
Don't wait 'til you get to the nigga you gon' be with for the rest of your life (Life)
Just to start a fight (Fight)
Don't forget what you like (Like)
Don't give 100 to a wack ass nigga in your past
That show up with half of that, tryna make it last
And what makes us good is that I always saw that bad in you (Always saw that bad in you)
See, 'cause it's easy to forget about the lovers in my past
'Cause I put your love on top and give you everything I have
Whatever love I gave them, I give you more than that, ooh, uh

[Chorus]
So don't let this dick change you
And I won't let that pussy change me
Real shit
Don't let this dick change you
And I won't let that pussy change me, oh no
We gon' be who we gon' be

[Post-Chorus]
Don't wait 'til you get to that nigga you gon' be with for the rest of your life
I know the fear can have you tight
Now that you got something that you like
Don't wait 'til you get to the nigga you gon' be with for the rest of your life (Life)
Just to start a fight (Fight)
Don't forget what you like (Like)
Don't give 100 to a wack ass nigga in your past
That show up with half of that, tryna make it last
And what makes us good is that I always saw that bad in you (Always saw that bad in you)
See, 'cause it's easy to forget about the lovers in my past
'Cause I put your love on top and give you everything I have
Whatever love I gave them, I give you more than that, ooh, uh
