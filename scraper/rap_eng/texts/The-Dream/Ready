[Intro]
Yeah, we got them motherfuckin' towels, nigga
Ain't even come here for all this, but

[Verse 1]
She only 22, but I think I done met my match
Head to toe Balenciaga, 22's up on the ac
Shawty love a father figure, and my figure's at the max
Hope your daddy don't get mad at me if I don't bring you back
Girl, I need that in my crib, put that thing on me for real
Hope you with that shit, like yeah
Fuck the bed up off the rails
Bet you think that you a player
Wasn't tryna hone in on your skills
Shawty, you better know the drills, yeah yeah

[Chorus]
I hope you ready 'cause I don't think you ready
But she get what she wants, she get what she wants
I ain't them lil niggas on your phone
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want
I hope you ready 'cause I don't think you ready
But you want what you want, you want what you want
'Til your back get tore out 'til the morn
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want
Girl, you not ready

[Verse 2]
Way you in here dancing, I can't lie, I'm lovin' it
And man, that shit's so fat, I can see that shit from the back
I only wrote one verse and I already got off track
She baggin' that shit up while she backin' that shit back
She'll be your Lois Lane in the morning
And plays Wonder Woman at night
Ooh, your body might be callin', but I see it in your eyes
Girl in disguise, playin' with that vibe
They say chemistry don't lie, lie

[Chorus]
Girl, you not ready (Ain't ready)
'Cause I don't think you ready (You're not ready)
But she get what she wants, she get what she wants
I ain't them lil niggas on your phone
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want
I hope you ready (I'm ready)
'Cause I don't think you ready (You're not ready)
But you want what you want, you want what you want
'Til your back get tore out 'til the morn
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want
Girl, you not ready

[Bridge]
Done got caught up with a bad bitch
If she sold her pussy, man, I swear I'd be a addict
Way she shake her ass, I swear she should work in magic
I'm jumpin' out the car, in my feelings, stoppin' traffic
I told her later on, I'ma come through and kill it, casket
Shawty put that shit on me and fucked me through the mattress
Pussy fat, pussy deep, pussy skeet, Gladys, all night
And that pussy taste like vanilla wafers

[Chorus]
Girl, you not ready (Ain't ready)
'Cause I don't think you ready (You're not ready)
But she get what she want, she get what she want
I ain't them lil niggas on your phone
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want
I hope you ready (I'm ready)
'Cause I don't think you ready (You're not ready)
But you want what you want, you want what you want
'Til your back get tore out 'til the morn
This ain't what you want, this ain't what you want
Girl, you not ready
