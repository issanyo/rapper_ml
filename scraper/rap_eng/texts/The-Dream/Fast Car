Baby, you're just a little too sweet for me
Oh baby, I don't know if you got what I need
And I wanna love you, baby
I wanna show you there's nobody like me
And I trust ya (trust ya), baby
I need a bad girl, you're just too good for me

[Hook]
I need a fast car, candy coated red
Drive me all night, and park it in my bed

Racetrack waiting in my bedroom
Show me the green light (oo-ooo-ooo)
Show me the green light (oo-ooo-ooo)
Show me the green light (oo-ooo-ooo)

[Bridge 1]
She's a pretty car, nice seats
Cooler than my A/C
Chrome wheels, perfect dash
Racing brakes, good on gas
She looks good when she's out on the road
But I'm living fast and I'm try'na lose control
Is it with you? Is it with you? Is it with you? Or someone else?
Is it with you? Is it with you? Is it with you? Or someone else?
Is it with you? Is it with you? Is it with you? Or someone else?
Is it with you? Is it with you? Is it with you? Or someone else?

[Hook]
I need a fast car, candy coated red
Drive me all night, and park it in my bed
I need a fast car, (fast car) I wanna see ya zoom
Racetrack waiting in my bedroom
Show me the green light (oo-ooo-ooo)
Show me the green light (oo-ooo-ooo)
Show me the green light (oo-ooo-ooo)
Show me the green light (oo-ooo-ooo)

[Bridge 2]
If you're sittin' on them 24's
I wanna see you make it go
Round and round and up and down
If you're sittin' on them 24's
I wanna see you drop it low
Round and round and up and down

Fast car, yes sir, I need a fast car, yes sir
I need a fast car, oh yes sir, Radiokilla
I need a fast car, oh yes sir

[Hook]
I need a fast car, candy coated red
Drive me all night, and park it in my bed
I need a fast car, (fast car) I wanna see ya zoom
Racetrack waiting in my bedroom
Show me the green light (oo-ooo-ooo)
Show me the green light (oo-ooo-ooo)
Show me the green light
Show me the green light
