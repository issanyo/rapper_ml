[Verse 1:]
It was the smile
It was the style
That had me gone from the jump
It was your name
It was your sign that made me want, to run

Flying to Vegas, packing my bags
Don't know where it will take us
When I'll come back
I'll be with you
You'll be with me
And the rest is history

Welcome to Vegas
Love on the runway soon as we land
In the airport, holding my hand

Welcome to Vegas
Louis duffle bags
We exit out the terminal
I'm forever yours

Welcome to Vegas
Ever yours
I'm forever yours
I'm forever yours

Welcome to Vegas
I'm forever yours
I'm forever yours
I'm forever yours
Welcome to Vegas

[Verse 2:]
It was your lips
And the first kiss
That had me rolling around in bliss
It was your touch, your home
You took my heart in from the cold

Flying to Vegas
Packing my bags
Don't know where it will take us when I'll come back
I'll be with you
You'll be with me
And the rest is history

[Bridge:]
It's just me and you
Baby, let's go and get low
Our love
Your love
I'm feina let the whole world know

Ooo, this will be a night to remember
We'll look back and remember (oh)
I'm standing in this chapel
And nothing else matters

Welcome to Vegas
Low, low, low, we go go go go
Low, low, low, we go go go go

Oh, oh, oh, oh, it's just me and you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, our love, your love
I'm feina let the whole world know

Oooh, this will be a night to remember
We'll look back and remember
Oh

I'm standing in this chapel
And nothing else matters
Welcome to Vegas
