Behind every great man
There's a woman, woman, woman
She never lets me down
She makes me feel so, so, so good

When she's loving me
Man, it's like, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
She's my ride or die
Twenty-four, seven, three, sixty-five

So no matter what is facing me
She has a way to give me strength
For her I'll wait a life but I can't go tonight
Without hearing the voice of an angel

The difference is
She makes the world a little better
The difference is
She makes it hurt a little lesser

The difference is
She can take away the pressure
The closest thing to heaven
Ooh, that's the difference

Now find a right one
You'll walk a little better
You'll talk a little better
You'll eat a little better

You'll dress a little better
She's the closest thing to heaven
Ooh, that's the difference
Hey, she makes the difference

She lets the weight
Right off of my shoulders, shoulders, shoulders
And with this girl
I can picture growing older, older, older

And if you got one like mine
Better pull her closer, closer, closer
Don't play the cool guy, you'll lose your chance
To show her, show her, show her

Oh, this is the best of me
A hundred percent she expects from me
That's why I'm blessed with life to see her every night
And feel the touch, the touch of an angel

The difference is
She makes the world a little better
The difference is
She makes it hurt a little lesser

The difference is
She can take away the pressure
The closest thing to heaven
Ooh, that's the difference

Now find a right one
You'll walk a little better
You'll talk a little better
You'll eat a little better

You'll dress a little better
She's the closest thing to heaven
Ooh, that's the difference
Hey, she makes the difference

[Incomprehensible] try to say
If you see a girl like mine don't [Incomprehensible] away
'Cause a girl like that don't come 'round everyday
Yes, I said that's the difference

The difference is
She makes the world a little better
The difference is
She makes it hurt a little lesser

The difference is
She can take away the pressure
The closest thing to heaven
Ooh, that's the difference

Now find a right one
You'll walk a little better
You'll talk a little better
You'll eat a little better
You'll dress a little better
She's the closest thing to heaven
