Chorus:
Its all good
When ya down they gonna hate you like that used to
And when your up they gonna love you like they used to
It's all good
When your looking for your friends
Taking all that s***
Ain't got nothing on your rent
Its all good
Now they just smiling in your face
Checking your account tryna see how much to take
Its all good
Hey hommie i ain't mad at cha
Just to let ya know i kinda feel bad for ya

Verse 1:
How ya gonna try and act like were cool
Where were you when i needed to know the truth
Everybody out for self and nothing else
Use you all up till ain't nothing left
Can't take whats for ya
Not even cricket ass lawyers
Still in the same place cos your still you
Now im lookin at dem haters in my rear view

Pre-Chorus:
Ive been around the world and back again
Still up in the coop still leaning back
Through all the pain i've learned some things
Had to get some dirt of my shoulder up at the laundromat
Since i've been away a lot has changed
Go out of my way so you can see me smile
To commited to erase you now i got a straight boo
I put that on my unborn child

Chorus:
Its all good
When ya down they gonna hate you like that used to
And when your up they gonna love you like they used to
It's all good
When your looking for your friends
Taking all that s***
Ain't got nothing on your rent
Its all good
Now they just smiling in your face
Checking your account tryna see how much to take
Its all good
Hey hommie i ain't mad at cha
Just to let ya know i kinda feel bad for ya

Verse 2:
People will sell there souls to get where ya at
But if they seen what i seen they'd be running back
Wanted to cry for so long
03 left the game i was so gone
Whatcha thought was really something
Spent all the time standing next to nothing
I see the smoke in the mirror has finally cleared up
Im looking at you haters in my rear view

Pre-Chorus:
Ive been around the world and back again
Still up in the coop still leaning back
Through all the pain i've learned some things
Had to get some dirt of my shoulder up at the laundromat
Since i've been away a lot has changed
Go out of my way so you can see me smile
To commited to erase you now i got a straight boo
I put that on my unborn child

Chorus:
Its all good
When ya down they gonna hate you like that used to
And when your up they gonna love you like they used to
It's all good
When your looking for your friends
Taking all that s***
Ain't got nothing on your rent
Its all good
Now they just smiling in your face
Checking your account tryna see how much to take
Its all good
Hey hommie i ain't mad at cha
Just to let ya know i kinda feel bad for ya

Adlib (It's all good)

Outro:
Cos what goes around comes back around

It's all good
