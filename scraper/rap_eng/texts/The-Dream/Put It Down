[Verse 1]
Oh, baby, stop whatcha doing
And bring your little body up, up in this bed
Have you ever had somebody do it to you
While they was playing in your hair?
You want it from the front or the back, on your side just relax
And let me lay between your legs
I see ya running through like a track meet with your baton saying catch me
Baby don't be scared

[Hook]
I'm all up on you like a monster truck
I'm all up on you like shawty what's up
I'm all up on you like a white tee on a thug
If you can hear me baby put your hands up
And when they ask about me you say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
When they say does he make that horn go beep? You say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
Is he any good from the back? You say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
Well, what about this way you say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down

[Verse 2]
Whoa, well if they ask you can I sing like Usher, say no
But I can make you sing like Mariah
Ooh, if they ask you do I dance like Chris, tell them no
But as much rubbing as we do I could start a fire
Hey, bring the water, we sweating out the sheets
Shorty bring that body back to me
Shorty round after round it's going down
Call me Ali the way I knocked your ass out

[Hook]
I'm all up on you like a monster truck
I'm all up on you like shawty what's up
I'm all up on you like a white tee on a thug
If you can hear me baby put your hands up
And when they ask about me you say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
When they say does he make that horn go beep? You say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
Is he any good from the back? You say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
Well, what about this way you say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down

[Verse 3]
A T L A N T A, GA that's where I stay
I get my motherfuckin' freak on like every day
If I invite you to my house it ain't just to say hi
It's like I took candy from a baby the way you cryin'
You fine, you sigh
Never had nobody put it on your ass like that
A sip of the 'Tron and I bring it right back
That's whatcha want I know you like that
She's at my house whatcha think about that
I love your girl, I loved your girl, she's screaming fuck that nigga

[Hook]
I'm all up on you like a monster truck
I'm all up on you like shawty what's up
I'm all up on you like a white tee on a thug
If you can hear me baby put your hands up
And when they ask about me you say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
When they say does he make that horn go beep? You say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
Is he any good from the back? You say
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
Well, what about this way you say

[Bridge]
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down
He put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down, put it down

[Outro]
I'm all up on you like a monster truck
I'm all up on you like shorty what's up
I'm all up on you like a white tee on a thug
Baby if you can hear me put your motherfucking hands up
Hands up, hands up
And if you hear me, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
