[Intro]
'Bout that time
I think it's 'bout that time again

[Verse 1]
I've been saving my conscience
Savin' it up for you
And I just have to admit it
That, girl, you and I invented fire
It's hard to hear the truth from a pretty liar

[Chorus]
And as we go twelve, three, six
Unravel in love, rage, sex
Recover this love we lost
I'm tuxedo
I'm tuxedo
Baby, I'm tuxedo

[Verse 2]
The first time, I wasn't ready
And now, I see the light
Promise you will keep me steady
When you rock me through the night, oh
Went two miles from glory, mmm
And we can't avoid the fame
And I just have to admit it
That girl, you and I live in a fire
It's hard to hear the truth from a pretty liar

[Chorus]
As we go twelve, three, six
Unravel in love, rage, sex
Recover this love we lost
I'm tuxedo (I just need your body now)
Then we go on and on and on
Until it goes on and on and on
(I ain't got nothin' but love for ya, baby)
Back up again, on, yeah, yeah
(And you ain't got nothin' but love for me, baby)
I'm tuxedo (Come on, come on, come on, yeah)
I'm tuxedo

[Outro]
(I'm ready, I'm ready)
I'm suited up (I'm ready, I'm ready)
Louis Vuitton, booted up (I'm ready, I'm ready)
You'll see soon enough (I'm ready, I'm ready)
I'm glued to you (Glued to you)
Baby, I'm glued to you (Baby, I'm into you)
Shouldn't be new to you (Shouldn't be new to you)
Never meant to make a fool of you, oh yeah
(I'm ready, I'm ready, yeah)
I'm ready, ready
I'm ready, ready
I'm ready, ready, yeah
I'm ready, ready
(I'm ready, ready, yeah)
(I'm ready, ready)
