Tell me what you want babe
I’ll do whatever it takes
I’ll make you my favorite
Tell me what you want now
I will give it somehow; I will be the best thing


I wanna have fun with you, tonight
I wanna have fun with you, tonight

You’ve been everything that I want to be apart of
You call me when you get home, I’ll be right over
You won’t have to go at it alone we’re too deep baby
You, I am today we lay in this love. Still young

Tell me what you want babe
I’ll do whatever it takes
I’ll make you my favorite
Tell me what you want now
I will give it somehow; I will be the best thing

I wanna have fun with you, tonight
I wanna have fun with you, tonight
