[Intro: The-Dream]
Baby let's roll away
Get lost in the day
I love that you love what you do
And just like any girl, baby I'll love you the same
I know you gotta go, the DJ is calling you to the stage
Go ahead baby, do your thing

[Hook: The-Dream]
Honey complexion
Body of a goddess
22s on the Lexus, named Alexis
By the way of Texas
Big face Rolexes
While she's undressing, man I'm stressing
She's extremely blessed
Extremely blessed

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Give us this day our daily bread
If you a chicken head, go somewhere and lay some eggs
I make you, make your bed, take that head
I got a move that will break your leg, know what I’m talking about
Known to kill pussy, nigga chalk it out
Our first date was the Waffle House
Different day, different escapades
If they don’t like it they opinions like Escalade's
Everybody got one

[Hook: The-Dream]
Honey complexion
Body of a goddess
22s on the Lexus, named Alexis
By the way of Texas
Big face Rolexes
While she's undressing, man I'm stressing
She's extremely blessed
Extremely blessed

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Yeahh
She slow grinded the whole time
I told her have a seat, you sitting on a gold mine
Big ass, long hair, thick thighs
Eat Lobster tail like French Fries
I’m the type to buy you a car for the fifth time
This skinny nigga doing big time
Oh wait, dinner dates I demonstrate how to penetrate
If you ain’t wit it, then its elimi-date

[Hook]
Honey complexion
Body of a goddess
22s on the Lexus, named Alexis
By the way of Texas
Big face Rolexes
While she's undressing, man I'm stressing
She's extremely blessed
Extremely blessed

[Outro: The-Dream]
Baby let’s roll away
Get lost in this day
Say it’s okay
Come to me
Extremely blessed
