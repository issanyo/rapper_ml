Uh, uh

Oh!

Ahh-ah-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh-ah-ah-ahh

[Verse 1: Gita]
Are you sure that you're up for this?
Do you think you can handle it?
It's complicated, you might get frustrated

We got the moves that you've neva' seen
Let me show you just what I mean
There's, really, no chance that you can do our dance

[Pre-Chorus: Gita]
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no
Try to keep up, try to keep up, yeah
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

Oh no, uh-uh, uh-uh
Oh no, show me what you got

[Chorus: Gita]
Try to follow, watch me, now
If you think that you know how
Then dance me (dance me)
Dance me if you can (dance me if you can)
Get it together, or fall apart
If you think it's not that hard
Then dance me
Dance me if you can (dance me if you can)
Oh!

[Interlude: Gita]
Dance me if you can
Dance me (dance me)
Dance me if you can

[Verse 2: Dorinda]
I know that you think you're in control
But watch and learn cause this is how we roll

[Chanel]
Work it just like this
Let's see you try do that

[Aqua]
What's the matter?
Can't you figure it out?
Cause you look confused, mixed up, no doubt

[Chanel]
There's, really, no chance that you can do our dance

[Pre-Chorus: The Cheetah Girls]
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no
Try to keep up, try to keep up, yeah
Can't keep up, can't keep up, no

Oh, oh
C'mon, c'mon
Yeah, yeah
Show me what you got

[Chorus: The Cheetah Girls & (Chanel)]
Try to follow, watch me, now (oh)
If you think that you know how
Then dance me (dance me)
Dance me if you can (oh, yeah)
Get it together, or fall apart (uh-huh)
If you think it's not that hard
Then dance me (dance me)
Dance me if you can (dance me if you can)
(Ye-ah)

Oooooh
[Bridge: Gita]
Is that the best that you can do?
(Oooo-ooooh)
You're gonna have to try much harder
(Oooooh)

[Dorinda]
Now's the time to make ya' move, ya' know?

[The Cheetah Girls & Gita]

[Chorus: The Cheetah Girls & Gita]
Try to follow, watch me now
If you think that you know how, then dance me (dance me)
Dance me if you can
Get together or fall apart
If you think it's not that hard, then dance me (dance me)
Dance me if you can


[Outro: The Cheetah Girls, Gita, & Chanel]
(Woooo!)
Everybody wants to win (wants to win)
If you think that you can handle it
Then dance me (hey-e-ey!)
Dance me if you can (he-ey, yea)
Make it look easy, that's the way (that's the way)
If you think you got what it takes
Then dance me (whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa!) (dance me)
Dance me if you can

[Chanel]
Dance me if you can!
