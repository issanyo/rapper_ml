[Verse 1: Juis]
You take the clothes off my back
And I watch you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Yeah
You curse my name
In spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it all for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much
Yeah

[Hook: Juis]
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from your cup
Till it runneth over
Holy Grail

[Verse 2: Trey Coachman]
Soak me with this holy water
This liquid will bother
The feelings of addiction and conflict-ion
Given from the TV screen
I’m a confused kid
Starting to question what that means
So I close my iris’s
And back my thoughts to what the parliament and pirates did
When they wanted to receive what they want
But that can be taken, but not my knowledge and I know this is the time I need to be awaken
To this day, I go in the rain
Trying to get the sword out of the stone
Used to be a sad walk home
But times and altered, into my favor
Not going home with a sword straighter then the beam of a laser
But I see, with my eyes still closed
This depiction of a horror is giving the culling of my toes
I put the sword back in the stone
I just knew I could do it, but don’t need the fame
This holy water coming down brightens my day
