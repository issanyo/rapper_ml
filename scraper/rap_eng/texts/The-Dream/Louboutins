[Intro]
Uh uh oh ahh radio killer
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love
Taking back my love

[Verse 1]
You said you changed
But still nothing
You're still the same
I'm just a part time lover
And I'm the blame
Should have went away
But yet I stayed
With a part time lover

[Pre-Chorus]
See, somedays you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

[Chorus]
Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm moving on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

[Verse 2]
I left the state
And changed everything
No more 818
For the part time lover
What goes around
Comes back around
One day you get what you deserve
You part time lover

[Pre-Chorus]
See, somedays you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

[Chorus]
Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm moving on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

[Outro]
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
