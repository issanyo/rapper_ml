[Verse 1]
O come, O come, Emmanuel
And ransom captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appears

[Chorus]
Rejoice, rejoice, Emmanuel
Shall come to thee, O Israel

[Verse 2]
O come, Thou Day-Spring
Come and cheer
Our spirits by Thine advent here
Disperse the gloomy clouds of night
And death's dark shadows put to flight

[Chorus] [x4]
