[Intro]
[Ciara]: I just wish I had extra, extra everything
[The-Dream]: Trick, we did it again

[Verse 1: Ciara]
Now I, I just wanna be wherever you are
And I will love you baby sun or rain
And I just wanna let you know that I will always be down
Boy I, I, I, I just wanna make you feel good
And I just wanna love you like you deserve
You'll never ever need for another girl

[Bridge]
I'd need extra day on the week
An extra hour on the clock
Just to show you how beautiful you are
You're so good to me boy
You're so good to me
Yeah I'd need an extra month on the year
One extra holiday just to kiss you all over your face
You're so good to me boy
You're so good to me

[Hook]
You got me
I'm speechless
I'm speechless
Ahw, you got me speechless
I-I-I-I'm speechless I-I'm
What do I do baby

[Verse 2]
Baby I, I wanna be the girl that gives you everything
My whole heart, every piece, every part of me
And I'm gon' do my best
To make sure that you never leave
And boy, you do your best
Cause you're the reason that I breathe
And sometimes we gon' fight
But at the end of the night I humble myself
Baby, we're alright
Make sure that we're tight
Your love is my muse
No more will I have to choose
You're my number one, there's no number two

[Bridge]

[Hook: 4x]

[Verse 3]
Baby, I'm thankful for all the days
You've had my back
Could've been anywhere in the world
But look where you're at
You're loyal to me
It's me and you against the world
And I'm loyal to you
I will always be your girl
I'll be wrong with you
I'll be right with you
So just take us both
You hurt him, you hurt me too

[Bridge]
