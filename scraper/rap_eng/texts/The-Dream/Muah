Oo, oo, oo, ah, ah, ah
Yeah
Electric

[Verse: Naomi]
Bet you never had nobody like this (like this)
Had lipstick kiss like this (like muah)
Girls come at the drop of a dime
But their candies ain't quite like mine
See I got this little thing that I do
If you were my man I would do it to you
Thanks for the drink, but you better move
Cause I'm up in here with two

[Chorus]
And I'm the shit with the shit shawty (x3)
I'm the shit with the shit
I kno wat I'm doin with this shit
Cause I'm the shit with the shit shawty (x2)
I'm the shit
Muah [x6]

[Verse 2: Binkie]
Now tell me what you really gonna do with that
Never seen a girl with an ass so fat
I'm not a stripper but I dance like that
I'm not a stripper but where the money at?!
I'm not a freak, I'm not a nasty hoe
Well I'm lyin', but I'm classy though
I'm like you, I wanna get get get it
To the bedroom hit hit hit it
I'm not a ditz I got a brain
You saw my titties before you see my face
It's all good nigga, don't be 'shamed
I would feel the same, Cause I know you know

[Chorus]

Muah [x11]

[Bridge:]
I have 'em like hey hey hey
And I know you had plenty but you never had a girl that put it on you this way
And it ain't no shame if I'm giving it to you, doesn't mean I love you babe
Anything for you baby, I got you going crazy
Love Love Love (x2)

[Chorus]

I got you crazy (muah)
I got you crazy (muah)
Yea I know just what you want (muah)
I'm a give you what you want (muah)
I got you crazy (muah)
Crazy [x5]
I got you crazy (muah)

[Talks: Naomi]
'cause I'm the shit with this shit
But I like you
Now, there's a couple things I'd like to show you
But you gotta stay sharp with it, you know?
I need someone I can ball out with, kick it with, do things with
But you gotta focus
I mean, I do what I do so I need to make sure you on point

Okay?
Alright
