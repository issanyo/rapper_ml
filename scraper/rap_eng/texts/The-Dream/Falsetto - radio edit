Started out talking right here
Putting it down like a muthafuckin mack
Selling candy all up in my ear
She wanna be down like the D's on the lac
Slow dancing in the club
Diamonds look like rainbows
She grindin on my dick
She looking for the pot of gold
We hop up in the AMG indeed we in the western
She putting moves on me, I coulda swore shawty's a wrestler
Talking all that shit soon as I hit
Now I got her talkin like this
In a falsetto
She like ooh ooh baby
Aah aah aah ooh

She like ooh ooh baby

She like ooh ooh baby
Aah aah aah ooh

Aah aah aah aah
She telling all her homies I'm the real deal
Every time she leave the crib shawty be coming right back
She talking dirty all up in my ear
And I'm finna put this dog right on her kitty cat
I wasn't gon show you up
But then you got that liquor in you
Calling last night fluke
Acting like she didn't remember
I hopped up out the linen and i'm finna defend my title
Finna put your ass to bed
Tell me which way would you like it
Talkin all that shit soon as I hit
Now I got her talkin like this (whoa oh oh oh oh)
In a falsetto
