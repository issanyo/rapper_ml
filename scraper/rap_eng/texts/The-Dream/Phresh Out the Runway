[Intro: Rihanna]
I see you walk

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
Love it, then come and get it
I know that ya fuckin' with it
Ya see me, ya like it, huh?
Heels Givenchy, huh?
Love it, then play it back
Plus where the 40 at?
I'm fucking ya cheap trill
On top of my 50 mill
We eating the cake killa
Own it, but don't kill her
My jewelers are diamond rollers
My rock, chinchilla

I got 50 muthafuckers in my watch
With my bandz out

But you so fucking pop?

And sound like you selling rocks?

Got change for small dollars
Everything plain dollars

You throwing up the gang sign
