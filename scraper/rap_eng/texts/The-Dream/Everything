[verse 1:]
When I'm out on the road
Going from show to show
Told my homie romeo
How much I miss you so
I don't know how much longer it'll be
I'm missing you, wanting you
And I really want to talk to you
(Oh no) I left my 2-way at home
Still sitting on the charger
(Oh no) my battery is dead on my cell phone
And I really want to call ya
J-boog gotta let me use your phone
Gotta call my baby back home
Let her know what she means to me
Cause we gotta be

[Chorus 2x:]
Your my (your my) angel (angel)
Your my (your my) heart girl
Cause your my everything (your everything I want in a woman)
Girl your my everything (your everything I need in a woman)

[verse 2:]
I got cha on the phone
You saying you wish I was home
But then you flip the script
Tryna put me in the wrong
And you think I'm lying when I been trying all day to talk to you
Juggling videos and photo shoots
(Baby girl don't think) that when your calls go by and by I don't really want to call ya
(Don't think) got me screening my calls while checking my caller I'd tryna dodge ya girl
Trying be all I can be
A young man in this industry
You mean the world to me
You are my everything I

[Chorus 2x:]
Your my (your my) angel (angel)
Your my (your my) heart girl
Cause your my everything (your everything I want in a woman)
Girl your my everything (your everything I need in a woman)

[hook:]
Girl
I want you to know
Nothing will come between you and me
Girl I want you to know
You'll always be
My everything

[rap:]
Baby girl I'm missing
Can't wait to get home so I can hold you
Planets loves when it comes to you
Faithful and true is what I stay to you
Your my homie when I chill with you
Throw on some sweats with some nike shoes
All gifts are diddy from me
Louie skirt with the mini tee
See times been hard for me
Being on the road without my wifey
Lookin at my watch as the time go by
Lookin at the skies as the days go by
Wishing on these days you could fly
Til the next time you'll be by my side
For you I ride
For you I ride
Me and you girl like bonnie and clyde

[Chorus 2x:]
Your my (your my) angel (angel)
Your my (your my) heart girl
Cause your my everything (your everything I want in a woman)
Girl your my everything (your everything I need in a woman)
