[Verse 1]
I'd rather be with you, but you never tried to holla
We can spend a couple milli actin' silly in Milano
Boy, hit your horn beep, beep, I'll follow
Have your whip in my driveway by tomorrow
Secretly I know you wanna hit it like the lotto
And after that, we can ketchup like tomato
We can make love in Italy in the Grotto
Fresh off the jet at the Met
They're screamin' bravo, bravo, bravo

[Pre-Chorus]
Steppin' in my Jimmy Choo's, yeah
I got it all cute for ya, baby
Nothing like them other girls
I would never be rude to you, baby
Can't wait, just say that you wanna be

[Chorus]
More than just friends
Boy, I'm gonna love you until the end
The end, the end, the end, the end
More than just friends
Boy, I'm gonna love you until the end
The end, the end, the end, the end
More than just friends
Boy, until the end

[Verse 2]
Boy, you got me all mixed up like Serato
You got me spinnin' 'round for ya like a lil' model
Steady fiendin' for you like them fries at McDonalds
I wanna be all on your lips like gelato
Permanently paint me in your picture like Picasso
Love me down till I hit the top of my soprano
We can pop bottles, get me actin' all me llamo
Then baby come and flip this thing like a channel

[Pre-Chorus]
Steppin' in my Chrissy Lou's, yeah
I got it all cute for ya, baby
Nothing like them other girls
I would never be rude to you, baby
Can't wait, just say that you wanna be

[Chorus]
More than just friends
Boy, I'm gonna love you until the end
The end, the end, the end, the end
More than just friends
Boy, I'm gonna love you until the end
The end, the end, the end, the end
More than just friends
Boy, until the end

[Bridge]
Who's gonna speak and start off this thing?
Is it you is it me?
We should say how we feel for real sugar, baby
Boo, I need your touch
Never wanted somethin' so much
Friendship just ain't enough
Boy, I wanna be with you until the end
The end, the end, the end, the end

[Chorus]
More than just friends
Boy, I'm gonna love you until the end
The end, the end, the end, the end
More than just friends
Boy, I'm gonna love you until the end
The end, the end, the end, the end
More than just friends
Boy, until the end
