Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Glory hallelujiah

Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Nobody knows my, my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Glory hall- glory hallelujiah

Sometimes I'm up and sometimes I'm down
Oh, yes lord
You know sometimes almost to the ground
Oh, oh yes lord

Still, nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Nobody, nobody knows my, my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Glory hallelujiah

If you get there before I do
Oh, oh yes lord
Don't forget to tell all my friends I'm comin' too
Whoa, oh yes lord

Still, nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Nobody knows my sorrow
Nobody knows the trouble that I've seen
Glory hall- hallelujiah
