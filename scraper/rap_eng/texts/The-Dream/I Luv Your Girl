And you know what I mean ahh, baam baam

Trick beat the track up like gorillas

[Verse 1]
Yeah we up in the club, I see her do her thang
You might wanna' rap, but she'll make you sing
See I was on her, but she was on him
She all up on ma thang, I got my thang on her hip
She ATL pop, don't know how to act
She left for one song, and came right back
Grindin on me, the rest of the night
Her man started muggin', he could see it in my eyes

[Hook:]
Lil' mama so hood, (I love your girl)
Lil' mama stay fly (I love your girl)
Wife beater with the denim (I love your girl)
She keeps them heels on high, (I love your girl)
Man look at shorty roll, (I love your girl)
Man, look at shorty go, (I love your girl)
I'm sorry I got it in for your girl, girlfriend

[Bridge:]
Now she run her fingers through her hair, he tryin ta call her over there but she like, (Fuck! That nigga!)
She drop it down to the floor, I'm like shorty you should go, but she like (Fuck! That nigga!)
Call it in "ENVY", I want her on me, all up in my head, now she in my bed
I, I, I, I, I

[Verse 2]
Me and lil shorty in the back, Talkin' bout dis diss, talkin' bout dat dat
Got her on the 'Tron, she actin' all bad
Your girl chose me, don't be mad

The way she rock that, got the boy in love
And I pray that y'all ain't serious, cause seriously shes on my dick
