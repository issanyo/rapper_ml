Whoooaaa!

Oh my God!

Whoooooaaaa!

Radio Killa!

I heard you ain't hittin' it right

He ain't got the right love for you
He got the job but he can't work it like I do
He's young-minded, sometimin'
And you need a man that can handle you
It's hard to find them rare diamonds
But you love it when you do
I know you're used to those fly-by-night boyfriends
But what you really need is me, woman

Always up in the VIP
Always yelling out, "Drinks on me!"
Always all tricked up
Always never not givin' a fuck

Got my playas over here
And my haters over there
I got my drink up in the air
'Cause she on her way over

'Cause I'm a veteran
She dancing up on me, dancing up on me, hold me all close
Diamonds on my wrist, got her eyes wide open
And the Belvedere got her coming out her clothes
I'm a veteran
First I buy out the bar, then I pop bottles
I own what I'm sippin'
They don't make a car I can't dip in
You trippin'

But she
You ain't hittin' it right
You ain't hittin' it right
You ain't hittin' it right
You ain't hittin' it right
You ain't gettin' it right
You ain't gettin' it right
You ain't gettin' it right
She needs some Dream in her life, yeah

Girl, I know you ain't getting the love that you deserve
No no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no no, no!
And girl I know I can please you, all you got to do is say the word
Girl you know, girl you know, girl you know, girl you know, oh!
The man you with ain't cool
He's full of insecurities
I can keep a relationship smooth
You should fuck with me

Always up in the VIP
Always yelling out, "Drinks on me!"

Always all tricked up
Always never not givin' a fuck

Got my playas over here
And my haters over there
I got my drink up in the air
'Cause she on her way over

'Cause I'm a veteran
She dancing up on me, dancing up on me, hold me all close
Diamonds on my wrist, got her eyes wide open
And the Belvedere got her coming out her clothes
I'm a veteran
First I buy out the bar, then I pop bottles
I own what I'm sippin'
They don't make a car I can't dip in
You trippin'

But she
You ain't hittin' it right
You ain't hittin' it right
You ain't hittin' it right
You ain't gettin' it right
You ain't hittin' it right
You ain't gettin' it right
You ain't gettin' it right
She needs some Dream in her life, yeah

Always up in the VIP
