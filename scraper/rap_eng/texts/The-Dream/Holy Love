No lie
I'm a rolling stone
I stay ultra high
It's gotten harder to live
Easier to die

But my rolling stone
She said there will never be
Love for me
But you'll have everything
But everything

Now no fancy car
Can replace my love
Not even a million women
Could help me feel that love
I sacrifice everything
For this love
On a rainy day in 07
I found an umbrella
Got a taste of it
And made a deal with her

For the holy love, holy love
I made deal with her
Holy love, holy love
The first and only love
You can't compete with her

I'm a a rolling stone
There will never be love for me
I'll be searching through
Forever endlessly
I sit amongst the throne
Inherited enemies
Became royalty
In this dynasty

Thought this fancy car
Would replace my love
Took the hands of women
To feel that love
I sacrificed everything
Yet I'm still praying for love
I came across another virgo
Every one knows
Got another taste
And re-up my deal with her

For the holy love, holy love
The first and only love
I made deal with her
Holy love, holy love
The first and only love
You can't compete with her

You can't compete with her
You can't compete with her
You can't compete with her
