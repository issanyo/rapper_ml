So we was up, up in the club
To the bar, hit 'em up
Now it's straight to the bar, hangin' low
Hips made him fall
Could you pick him up?

All up in my ear
Talkin' mad shit
So I was all up in ear with some mad shit
Played hard to quit
But you kinda cute
I'ma hard to quit
But you kinda cute

Now he all up on me wanna know, see
All up on me like he know, see
So I put it on him for a couple weeks
Now he can't keep his hands off my zipper

Always lovin' on me, zipper
Always huggin' on me, zipper
And always got you tuggin' on my
Tuggin' on my zipper

Ain't got nothin' on me, zipper
Always searchin' on me, zipper
All I know
But he can't keep his hands

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know

When he's with me, he know
There ain't no place I'll rather be
They ain't like me
I got him hugged up, loved up

Tuggin' on my zipper
Tuggin' on my zipper
Tuggin' on my zipper
Tuggin' on my zipper, zipper

Always lovin' on me, zipper
Always huggin' on me, zipper
And always got you tuggin' on my
Tuggin' on my zipper

Ain't got nothin' on me, zipper
Always searchin' on me, zipper
All I know
But he can't keep his hands

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, zipper

Always lovin' on me, zipper
Always huggin' on me, zipper
And always got you tuggin' on my
Tuggin' on my zipper

Ain't got nothin' on me, zipper
Always searchin' on me, zipper
All I know
But he can't keep his hands

I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
