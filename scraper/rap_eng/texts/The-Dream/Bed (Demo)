[Verse 1]
Girl, change into that Victoria Secret thing that I like
Alright, okay, tonight you're havin' me your way
Perfume, spray it there, put our love in the air
Now put me right next to you, finna raise the temp' in the room
First rub my back like you do, right there (uh)
Right there (uh,) you touch me like you care
Now stop, and let me repay you for the week that you've been through
Workin' that nine to five and stayin' cute, like you do
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it, I love it
You love it, you love it
Every time, every time
We touchin', we touchin'
I want it, I want it
You want it, you want it
I'll see you, see you
In the mornin', in the mornin'

[Chorus]
Wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
Then love you 'til your eyes roll back
I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
Tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'ma rock ya body, turn you over
Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touchin' you like it's our first time
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

[Verse 2]
I'm staring at you while you sleep, irreplaceable beauty
Put my face up in your neck and breathe (Oh, breathe)
Take you into my senses, wake up, it's time to finish
Round two, it's a round two
Matter of fact, it's closer to three
She like, "How long I been sleep?"
Shawty kisses turn into the sweetest dreams
Girl give it to me
And I can feel her turn weak
"My angel, this is wonderful"
Thanks for lettin' me bless ya
Come down, fly right
Drift back into heaven
Oh, oh, oh, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
I love it, I love it
You love it, you love it
Every time, every time
We touchin', we touchin'
I want it, I want it
You want it, you want it
I'll see you, see you
In the mornin', in the mornin'

[Chorus]
Wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
Then love you 'til your eyes roll back
I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
Tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'ma rock ya body, turn you over
Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touchin' you like it's our first time
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed

[Bridge]
Watch the sunlight peak over the horizon
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
The sun ain't the only thing that's shinin'
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Now I'ma send you out into the world with my love
Tell everybody, ayy, ayy
Everybody, ayyyyy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayyyyy
Tell everybody
Ayy, ayy, everybody, ayy, ayyyyy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayyyyy
Ooooh

[Chorus]
Wanna put my fingers through your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
Then love you 'til your eyes roll back
I'm tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
Tryna put you to bed, bed, bed
Then I'ma rock ya body, turn you over
Love is war, I'm your soldier
Touchin' you like it's our first time
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed, bed
I'ma put you to bed, bed, bed
