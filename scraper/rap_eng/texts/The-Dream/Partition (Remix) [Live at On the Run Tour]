[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Wet, wet skeet skeeted on the Met dress
Uh, word to Ricardo Tisci
She like, ‘Oh my God,’ I’m like, ‘Nice to meet me’
Damn, girl, you got that Versace
Left the curtains open for the paparazzi
A little TMI for you, TMZ
Hope I get my D-I-C on your E-Y-E
Uh, the K silent, I’m a Brooklyn nigga
I let the K (sound affect) on you looking niggas
It’s to the death in case you wondering
I don’t need a hundred bitches ’cause my bitch keep it one hundred
One hundred

[Verse 2: Beyonce]
Driver, roll up the partition, please
Driver, roll up the partition, please
I don't need you seeing 'Yonce on her knees
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club
Now my mascara running, red lipstick smudged
Oh he so horny, yeah he want to fuck
He popped all my buttons, and he ripped my blouse
He Monica Lewinsky-ed all on my gown

[Pre-Hook: Beyonce]
Oh there daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh baby baby we betta slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Hook]

I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like

I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like

[Verse 3]
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Driver, roll up the partition fast
Over there I swear I saw them cameras flash
Hand prints and footprints on my glass
Hand prints and good grips all on my ass
Private show with the music blasting
He like to call me Peaches when we get this nasty
Red wine drip, we’ll talk that trash
Chauffeur eavesdropping trying not to crash

[Pre-Hook]
Oh there daddy, daddy didn’t bring the towel
Oh baby baby we betta slow it down
Took 45 minutes to get all dressed up
We ain't even gonna make it to this club

[Hook]
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like
Is right here with me

[Bridge]
Est-ce que tu aimes le sexe?
Le sexe, je veux dire : l'activité physique, le coït. Tu aimes ça?
Tu ne t'intéresses pas au sexe ?
Les hommes pensent que les féministes détestent le sexe mais c'est une activité très stimulante et naturelle que les femmes adorent

[Hook]
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kind of girl you like, girl you like
Take all of me
I just wanna be the girl you like, girl you like
The kinda girl you like
Is right here with me
