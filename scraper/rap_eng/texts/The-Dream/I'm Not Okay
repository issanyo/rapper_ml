[Intro]
My heart's your heart, my love's your love
And I'm not okay unless you're okay

[Verse 1]
I've seen what you're facing, please don't be alarmed
If you need me just call me, you're never alone
Hey, I'm barely been sleeping and barely eating
Until the rain turns into change

[Chorus]
My heart's your heart, my love's your love
And I'm not okay unless you're okay
And my mind is your mind and my soul is your soul
And I'm not okay unless you're okay

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm headed wherever you're going and I mean that from my heart
In the end you'll see that I've been there from the start
I'm not walking away, not talking just to say
Your pain's my pain and your game's my game

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I want to be right here to make sure your tears don't form a river
I'm going to be right here until your vision becomes clearer
I ain't sleeping, I'm not eating
Until the rain turns into change

[Chorus]
