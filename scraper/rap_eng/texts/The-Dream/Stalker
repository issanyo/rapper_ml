Rolling through the streets
Though I got somewhere to go
Driving past your house
Though I'm creeping on the low

I look up and see your light on through the window
But your truck ain't there
So maybe you're not home
Then I get to wondering having all kind of thoughts like

Maybe there some other chick
Sleepin' on them sheets I bought
I'm not usually so damn insecure
But I don't know what's up with you no more

I can feel my heart beating through my chest
A hundred beats per minute
Pounding through this fast
'Cause I realize I'm in disguise
Sanity compromised

This is getting crazy
But your ass done
Made me be a stalker
Be a stalker
I don't want to be a stalker
Be a stalker
But I gotta be

Dippin' in the city
Inna nothin' but my car
With my girls up in the back
Trying to find where you are
You tell me that you love me
Page me every day
So why is it that I don't believe a word that you say?

The rumors or maybe it's the little clues
I don't trust you
But I love you what can I do
You tell me that I should relax
That I don't got no solid facts
But you dug your last girl
Pulled some shit behind her back

Listen up
I won't be nobodys fool, boy
Earn my trust
Until then I'm watching you, boy

I can feel my heart beating through my chest
A hundred beats per minute
Pounding through this fast
'Cause I realize I'm in disguise
Sanity compromised

This is getting crazy
But your ass done
Made me be a stalker
Be a stalker
I don't want to be a stalker
Be a stalker
But I gotta be
