[Intro]
Go, shorty, get it, right
Get it, right, get it, night
All night, get it right

[Verse 1]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way to you
To do the things your man don't never do, oh yeah
I suffer, suffer, so
Girl, give me that antidote
Open up a folio
Show me everything you know
For sure, for sure, for sure
Let's pretend like I don't know
A lotta men like bein' loved
Like, "We never did this before"

[Pre-Chorus]
Tonight, I'm tellin' you whatever
You lovin' it, I'm clever
All true, I'm into you, but
It's now or never
It's your choice, you choose
I know you know what a nigga tryna do
I'm just tryna get you to the room

[Chorus]
You know, those lips ain't never looked better
You're screamin' out of your lungs
It's all about those three letters
And it won't stop until it won't stop until we're done
Tonight I'll play your man
And for tonight, you'll be my girl
Tonight, I'll give in to you
Just tryna get you to the room

[Bridge]
Go, shorty, get it, right
Truth is, truth is
Get it, right, get it, night
Just tryna get you to my room
All night, get it right
Go, shorty, get it, right
Truth is, truth is
Get it, right, get it, night
Just tryna get you to my room
Truth is, truth is
I'm just tryna get you to my room
To my room
Go, shorty, get it, right
To my room
Get it, right, get it, night
All night, get it right

[Verse 2]
Pull up to the Waldorf
Motorcade, Rolls Royce
Escorts, no passports
Forty cal in the dashboard
I ain't tell no lie
I could be the realest rapper alive
Coulda been the realest trapper alive
But the truth is, I'm too sensitive
And I'd really rather just lie
Down with you
She said, "Me too"
I'm just tryna get you to the room

[Chorus]
You know, those lips ain't never looked better
You're screamin' out of your lungs
It's all about those three letters
And it won't stop until it won't stop until we're done
Tonight I'll play your man
And for tonight, you'll be my girl
Tonight, I'll give in to you
Just tryna get you to the room

[Outro]
Truth is, the truth is
I'm just tryna get you to my room
Truth is, the truth is
I'm just tryna get you to my room
Go, shorty, get it, right
The truth is, the truth is
I'm just tryna get you to my room
Go, shorty, get it, right
To my room
All night, get it, right
