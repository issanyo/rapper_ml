Getting my story together
So I can tell it to whoever needs to know
Some things just need severed
And some things should be left alone

I'm here to bury you
I'm here to send you on your way
Hey

So long
How does it feel to be gone?
I've been digging this grave for days
All alone, all alone
Picking out your stones
Send you on your way
Pick out the right stone for your grave

Black roses feel like bombs
Falling down in speed slow motion
Life leaks out and
You're all gone and all alone
Like you left me now

Ghost
You were the most
And now you're nothing
But an old dream

Here to bury you
Bury you

Send you off
Limestone
