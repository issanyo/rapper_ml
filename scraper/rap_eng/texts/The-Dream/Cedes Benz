[Intro]
Can I get some Skittles, some dips, Reese's Pieces, pretzels and a large popcorn?
(A large? You got money, he got money, get it all for him)

[Hook]
Brand new Cedes Benz, Cedes Benz, Cedes Benz
Brand new Cedes Benz, Cedes Benz, Cedes Benz
Brand new Cedes Benz, Cedes Benz, Cedes Benz

[Verse 1]
Nigga put me on, now I’m everything I wasn't
Got money in these streets, niggas love me like a cousin
Word to TMZ, keep it moving, I ain’t budging
My mama told me “nigga don’t stop until you bussin"
I’m bussin. I'm G, got 'Sace on my jeans
A million dollar smile, diamonds wrapped around my teeth
And this some nigga shit but you can’t ignore the feeling
Leather on leather, suede on the ceiling, on the ceiling, ceiling

[Pre-Hook]
Brand new Cedes Benz, you can put that on my uncle
Pretty black thing, she remind of my mama
Red guts over bone, creeping on the come up
Talkin' all that shit, I gotta tec-9 for that drama
Brand new Cedes Benz, brand new, brand new Cedes Benz
Cedes Benz, Cedes Benz

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oh Jesus and Jehovah, fuck you in your Rover
Got Mary in my shotgun, “oh my God” when I roll up
I don’t give a fuck bruh, I don’t give a fuck bruh
Money come and go but I guess I wouldn’t know
You see miracle on my whip
Ketchup on the inside
Relish in my pocket nigga
You know I’m out that west side
And I know them Germans made it
I’ve been hooked since the 80's
Name my next son Merc
And name my next daughter Cedes (Sadie), baby

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
But I could really give a fuck about my Benz though
Just like I really give a fuck about your car note
Fuck with my girl, come through
And you know how I do
Yeah, my girl be on ten
Then she turn up in my Benz
My girl clean in this bitch
My girl clean in this bitch
Call her Chanel, in Chanel she mean in this bitch
These bitches hate it when they see her
Bet you thought you was a diva
And she should apologize, Baker, Anita
Girl clean when she come through in this bitch
My girl clean when she come through in this bitch
My baby clean when she come through in this bitch
These bitches hate it when they see her
Bet you thought you was a diva
And she should apologize, Baker, Anita

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
Be my confidant, drive this all you want
Promise you can back it up, baby you ain’t gotta front
We ain’t gotta shift the mood, just keep riding
Just tell me what you want baby I’m listening, I’m listening
We brand new in that brand new, Christening, we Christening
Feels like the first time

[Hook x3]
