[Intro:]

[Line ringing:]
"Record your message after the tone."

[Beep:]

[The Dream spoken:]
Yo come pick up, I'm a get you soon as I leave the studio

Ahh, Ahh, Ahh, Rihanna
E, e
Dreamer
Aw, Aw
E, e, e

[Verse 1]
I wanna tell the world that your my girl and that I'm your man, ahh baby
And I wanna tell the world that you got me, why can't we be, ahh baby
I can't put my name on your kiss
And I can't speak your name from these lips
We froze
And nobody knows
Have to walk out the room everytime you call
Tellin' everybody I ain't seen you in so long
It feels like I ain't breatin'
This feels worser than cheatin'

[Chorus]
'Cause we out here livin' a lie
Out here livin' a lie
I'm out here livin' a lie
Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry
I'm out here livin' a lie
I'm out here livin' a lie
We out here livin' a lie
Behind these smiles I'm really hurtin'
Inside-side-side
Inside-side-side
Inside-side-side
Inside-side-side

[Verse 2]
Everytime I wanna put us on display time takes a breathe, ahh Baby
I hear about other relationships that ain't true, I wanna set it right, ahh Baby
And I can't tell nobody how I feel, ooh
And I can't tell nobody how we is, ooh
I wanna hop on the first thing smokin'
Tell our agent to book us a plane
I wanna be near you
I wanna be near you, too
I wanna wake up, wake up
Right next to you baby

[Chorus]
'Cause we out here livin' a lie
Out here livin' a lie
I'm out here livin' a lie
Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry
I'm out here livin' a lie
I'm out here livin' a lie
We out here livin' a lie
Behind these smiles I'm really hurtin'
Inside-side-side
Inside-side-side
Inside-side-side
Inside-side-side

[Bridge]
Rihanna baby
Dream baby
What on this earth will we do?
Assume that I'm not a su-ume
And everythin' in this world has got us crazy
I'm so through
You too?
We alone
What the worst that could happen baby if they know?
Won't be nothin'
'Cause you're inpecable, your everything that I love

[Chorus]
'Cause we out here livin' a lie
Out here livin' a lie
I'm out here livin' a lie
Why what makes you smile seem to make you cry
I'm out here livin' a lie
I'm out here livin' a lie
We out here livin' a lie
Behind these smiles I'm really hurtin'
Inside-side-side
Inside-side-side
Inside-side-side
Inside-side-side

I wanna be with you
