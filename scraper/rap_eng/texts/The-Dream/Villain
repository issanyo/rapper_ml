[Intro]
Radio love
Jennifer
JLo

[Verse 1]
Now somehow you feel left out
Somehow you're feeling doubt
Got an inch but took a mile, oh no
Right now your body's in need
Can't replace what you had in me
My words are cutting deep, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
You've watched me fall, now I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I loved you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

[Chorus]
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I gave you my all, but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, baby, I'm the villain of your love

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Baby, I'm the villain, baby, I'm the villain

[Verse 2]
Oh, now you get the picture
Oh oh, now you wanna fix her
Oh oh, now you're screaming, "Let's go back"
I ain't having that
But now my love ain't around
It's behind walls that won't come down
But now you wanna show up and turn my sour sweet
You gon' miss me

[Pre-Chorus]
You've watched me fall, now I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I loved you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine

[Chorus]
There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I gave you my all, but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, baby, I'm the villain of your love

[Post-Chorus]
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I'm the villain, baby, I'm the villain of your love

[Outro]
I'm a villain, I'm the villain of your love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
I'm the villain, I'm the villain of your love
