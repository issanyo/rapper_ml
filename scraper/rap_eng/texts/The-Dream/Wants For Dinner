[Verse 1]
I'm right here when he calls me, yeah
I'm right here when he needs me, yeah
I'm the one he screams for day and night
And always make things alright, alright
I'm what he wants, he's what I need
He's on my phone like a ringtone
Baby, please, like, baby come home
I'm like baby please, then baby come home
You're mine, you're mine (6x)
Baby you know that you're mine

[Bridge 1]
You can entertain him all day long but I know what he likes for dinner (3x)
You can be his sides all day long but I'm what he wants for dinner
You can entertain him all day long but I'm what he wants for dinner

[Hook: 8x]
Yo girl, yo girl


[Verse 3]
There's nothing you can do to take him away from me, girl
There's nothing you can say
That will ever break him away from me, girl
Huff and puff, try all of your stuff
But my love is built out of bricks, yeah
And your love is built out of sticks
He knows, he knows that

[Bridge 2]
You can entertain him all day long but I know what he likes for dinner
Girl, you can entertain him all day long but I know what he wants for dinner
Girl, you can entertain him all day long but I know what he wants for dinner
You can entertain him all day long but I'm what he wants for dinner

[Hook: 7x]

What he wants for dinner

[Hook: 7x]

[Outro]
What he wants for dinner
What he wants for dinner
What he wants for dinner
What he wants for dinner
