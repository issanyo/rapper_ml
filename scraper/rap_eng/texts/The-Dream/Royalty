[Verse 1]
My girl in like this
My girl stay on tip
Her persona, sitting there
Ah-choo! She the shit
Still stacking that B money
I'm fresh out of my weed money
But that Umbrella still up
And that frame just keep coming

[Bridge]
Say ?? ain't nothin' to a baller
??
My girl need a house with the chandelier
She in that Rari, not to change the subject, switchin' gears

[Chorus]
I got a queen on my lap
Baby, dance for me
All golden black robes, that's her thing
Isis, Osiris, infinity
Jesus, Mary, royalty
Royalty
I put that on everything, we royalty
That's love, loyalty
I put us on everything, that's royalty

[Verse 2]
Got Jesus juice in my glass
Jesus juice in her glass
Fuck what Lorde talkin' 'bout
I love my Maybach
I'm royal, royal
Crown, crown, crown
Royal, royal

Me and my 'Dite
We walk around this bitch like warlords
Aphrodite decreed Apollo

[Chorus]
I got a queen on my lap
Baby, dance for me
All golden black robes, that's her thing
Isis, Osiris, infinity
Jesus, Mary, royalty
Jesus, Mary, royalty
I put that on everything, we royalty
Isis, Osiris, loyalty
I put us on everything, that's royalty

[Bridge]
Say ?? ain't nothin' to a baller
??
My girl need a house with the chandelier
She in that Rari, not to change the subject, switchin' gears

[Outro]
I got a queen on my lap
Baby, dance for me

Royalty
Royalty
Loyalty
Royalty
