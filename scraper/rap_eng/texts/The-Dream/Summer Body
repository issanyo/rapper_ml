[Intro: The-Dream]
Oh summer body
You got that thing we pray for
Radio Killa

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
She put in work for it
She get to twerk for it
She had to grind for it
She get to whine for it
She accomplish anything she put her mind to it
She a dime that ain't have to pay a dime for it
She get tomboy, Air Jordan concord
And when it's time for a padlock, Tom Ford
Heard the doc got you given up fried food
Heard you out here given them side boob
I heard you pullin' up in workout clothes
Heard baggie fits, you even perk out those
Twenty somethin' with a fat ass yeah
Summer coming like that fast
So shoutout to summer baby
You knew it was coming baby
That ass was always stupid
But now it look dumber baby
That's a summer school body
Come and pool party
Knowing you number 1 cause you the number 2 shawty

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
I need that rendezvous
I need that in my room
I need that bunker down
Tell your man no not now
Tell me when you're around
I want to rub you down
I'm trying to get with you
Have your crew meet my crew

[Hook: The-Dream]
And you know just what to do, you know what I like
Oh baby, whoa oh oh, ohh ohh ohh, ohhh ohh!
You know just how to be, you know I got a type
Oh baby, whoa oh oh, ohh ohh ohh, ohhh ohh!

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Oh, summer body
You got that thing we pray for
You got that stay all day long
That twenty four omega
Oh, summer body
You just might make me faithful
Don't make plans without me
Don't drink one more glass without me

[Verse 3: The-Dream]
She got the perfect waist
Fresh out that yoga class
You know that Pilates body
You know that Chai tea body
You know that fresh face, that...
No makeup and Starbucks
She wake up, like that
26, with a fat ass

[Hook: The-Dream]
And you know just what to do, you know what I like
Oh baby, whoa oh oh, ohh ohh ohh, ohhh ohh!
You know just how to be, you know I got a type
Oh baby, whoa oh oh, ohh ohh ohh, ohhh ohh!

[Chorus: The-Dream]
Oh, summer body
You got that thing we pray for
You got that stay all day long
That twenty four omega
Oh, summer body
You just might make me faithful
Don't make plans without me
Don't drink one more glass without me

[Bridge: The-Dream]
Girl your body's on tip right now
Because you're no simp right now
I won't let them take the temperature down (down), down (down)
Girl your body's on tip right now
Because you're no simp right now
Won't let them take the temperature down oh, down oh
Girl your body's on tip right now
Crushin' all versace silk right now
I won't let them take the temperature down, down
Girl your body's on tip right now
Crushin' all versace silk right now
Won't let them take the temperature down (take the temperature)
Oh baby

[Outro: Fabolous (& The-Dream)]
You know you gotta grind all winter
So you can shine all summer, right?
That's that level up!
You see it
Hah!
