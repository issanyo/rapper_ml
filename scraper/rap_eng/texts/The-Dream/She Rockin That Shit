Girl I'm in love with you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm trying to be your's

(Radio killa, killa, killa)
(Oh yessir, yessir)

We beat it up like gorillas
(Check, where you at? Oh yessir)

She goin' right, she goin' left
I had her here, to myself
I got it on it, like I want it
She rode the d, like a pony
Cameras up, cameras flash
I'm tispy, tryna relax
I wanna change your name to Mrs. Nash
Cause there's nothing left to say

She rockin' that thing like
She rockin' that thing like
There's nothing I can say
She rockin' that thing like
She rockin' that thing like
There's nothing I can say
She's just rockin' that thing like

We out the door, we in the car
She under my shirt, I'm under her bra
She said take it if you want it
Then we made love 'til the first light of morning
So we did it, done it, get it, got it
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Baby, she said do it to my body don't move
Baby, ooh. Baby

She rockin' that thing like
She rockin' that thing like

There's nothing I can say
She rockin' that thing like
She rockin' that thing like
There's nothing I can say
She's just rockin' that thing like

Girl I'm in love with you baby
And I want you to know
That I'm hooked on your body
And I'm trying to be your's

Hear my words for their worth
Ain't just tryna get in your clothes
Okay, I'm lying. Damn you fine
And uhm..

She rockin' that thing like
She rockin' that thing like
There's nothing I can say
She rockin' that thing like
She rockin' that thing like
There's nothing I can say
She's just rockin' that thing like

Take me, I'm your's (Shawty)
As we rock to the left, rock to the right
Lend me your body, I'ma rock it all night
Don't leave us on this floor shawty
The door's to the left, I'm parked on the right
Tell my n**** holla back, tell your girls goodnight

The way you rockin' that up in this club
I swear you gon' make a n* fall in love
The way you rockin' that up in this club
I swear you gon' make a n* fall in love, love
