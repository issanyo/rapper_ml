[Intro]

Growing up as a kid..I was ready for the ride..But what i ready for the journey

[Verse 1: The Dream]
I came home, I saw you there. Family over, but still no help. Fights happening. Love bonding, call me now, or in the morning. Being myself, the greatest help, I didn't know, was the one you didn't show. I wanted this, to go away, but i knew as times pass, the times fade. You work hard, you succeed. You dont. You believe. There was a reason, I didn't know. You came home it was the same old same old. You spent nights, raising me. I struggled, yet i still believe. The roads long, but so am I. I won't give up, Ill always try


[Verse 2: The Dream]
There's always hope dont forget, be youself, be the best. Still young, finding my way, only reason for you to stay. I never knew what we were in, family troubles, bad sins. Im focused, i hope you are too, I grew up becoming the man I once knew. No time to play, I've had my fun, you all believe in me. I need to be the one. Never stop, Work hard, stay motivated till you get there lifes hard. Its not fair, being a kid, to get it taken away at such a young age. But you know, Im still determined, they were there for me. Ill be something
