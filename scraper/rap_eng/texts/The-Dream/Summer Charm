[Intro]
No
No-oh
No
No-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I just met this guy
Baby I'm so in love
My very best friend
She hooked us up

[Pre-Chorus]
So wrap your lovin' around me
And you know there's no other place I'd rather be with you
With you

[Chorus]
Oh
You're the one I need by my side
I know I'm young but here, boy take my life
You're all I ever need here in my arms
My summer charm
My summer charm
My summer

[Verse 2]
There's not a day that goes by
That I don't dream about us
For every star in the sky
I get a kiss and a hug

[Pre-Chorus]
Boy wrap your lovin' around me
There's no other place I'd rather be than with you
In the middle of June

[Chorus]
Whoa, oh
You're the one I need by my side
I know I'm young but here, boy take my life
July through August you're still in my arms
My summer charm
My summer charm
My summer

[Bridge: Cassie & The-Dream]
Baby, oh I don't ever wanna look back
And wonder what happened to me and you
Cause this just ain't some summer fling, it's something
Boy I'm tellin' you (So don't you break my heart)
Then say you'll be my baby (Baby girl, I'll be your baby)

[Chorus]
Oh
You're the one I need by my side
I know I'm young but here, boy take my life
July through August you're still in my arms
My summer charm
My summer charm
My summer
