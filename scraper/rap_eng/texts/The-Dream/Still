Come To Me
I Want to Love You Back
Oh Baby Run To Me
You are the best I  had
Under the circumstance
I barely see your face
Can’t forsake what we have
It just can’t be replaced

I’m still yours
Whenever you wanna come back
I’m still yours… just like that
Uh huh
Ooooh yeah
I’m still yours
Ooooh yeah


Yes, I ignore your texts
Wish I could write you back
You say you’re over her
But  I don’t know the facts

I want to be your lover
Want you to be my friend
I want this to go on
Hope this time it won’t end


I’m still yours
Whenever you wanna come back
I’m still yours… just like that
Uh huh
Ooooh yeah
I’m still yours
Ooooh yeah
I don’t know what she doing but she got me jealous
Look at what she ruined gotta run and tell it
I hope I don’t seem foolish or super careless
But I wish I feel asleep and woke up back in Paris

With you x2

I’m still yours
Whenever you wanna come back
I’m still yours… just like that
Uh huh
Ooooh yeah
I’m still yours
Ooooh yeah

Interlude
Boy come talk  to me
I just need to see your face
Boy come and walk with me
I promise I won’t step in the way
Baby I need you right now
To take these tears and hold me like I’m tender
