[Verse 1:]
Boy you know I'm lovin' what you do
Put your lovin' in my gun, I wanna shoot
You're not the kinda guy a girl wanna lose
The way you stroke that, got me all up under you

[Pre-Chorus]
Watch you go (giddy up, giddy up now)
First, you grind it slow (get it, got it)
Hit it like a pro (ooh)
Make my body explode

[Chorus:]
Go shawty, go shawty, go shawty, go!
Go shawty, go shawty, go shawty, go!
Mo' shawty, mo' shawty, mo shawty, mo!
Mo' shawty, mo' shawty, mo shawty, mo!
Tick
Boom
Explode
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm, I'm... (x3)

[Verse 2:]
I'm hoping what you did ain't a fluke
Caught one, but I'm tryna catch two
Now, some of these guys ain't got a clue
But yoou, got me like, "ooh-ooh"

[Pre-Chorus]
So here's a toast (put it up, put it up now)
Sip, sip it slow (sizzurp)
'cause after this Merlot
Boy I'm gone need some more (ohhhh)

[Chorus:]
Go shawty, go shawty, go shawty, go!
Go shawty, go shawty, go shawty, go!
Mo' shawty, mo' shawty, mo shawty, mo!
Mo' shawty, mo' shawty, mo shawty, mo!
Tick
Boom
Explode
I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm, I'm... (x3)

[Breakdown:]
Ooh, Ah (That's it boy)
Ah, ah, ah (Right there boy)

Go shawty, go shawty, go shawty, go!
Go shawty, go shawty, go shawty, go!
Mo' shawty, mo' shawty, mo shawty, mo!
Mo' shawty, mo' shawty, mo shawty, mo!
Tick
Boom
Explode!
