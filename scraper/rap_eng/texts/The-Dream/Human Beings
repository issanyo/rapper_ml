[Intro]
I just wanna talk to you
Let's go back, go back to where real love used to be
You and me in the sand on the beach
Gold ropes, Rolexes and jet skis
Exit in Lexus, 470
You remember when

[Verse 1]
Through anything, our love will be good
And sometimes you would be mad and I'd be sad for you
How the fuck can you deal with a nigga like me?
Don't you know in the end I would make it up?
And you can tell by the way we make love
This ain't just sex
Always like our first time, even in the worst time

[Chorus]
I break your love, but we always come back
Come back and put it together again
You, ooh, break my love, ooh
But we always come back
Come back and put it together again

[Verse 2]
You know how I miss you when you're gone
When you're gone, alone, sittin' on that throne, ooh
And no matter when ain't nobody home, alone, ooh
Sittin' there, chillin' out, waitin' like
Really lookin' silly when there ain't nobody callin' on the phone
"Hello?"
You always pick the right fights, you pick the right fights
But only the make-up parts I like, only the make-up parts I like

[Chorus]
I break your love, but we always come back
Come back and put it together again
You, ooh, break my love, ooh
But we always come back
Come back and put it together again
