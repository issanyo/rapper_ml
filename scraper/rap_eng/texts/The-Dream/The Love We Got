[Verse 1:]
My heart, he takes
He'll always be my baby
We may bend
Won't break
But we got no one else to take
He's the sun when my day is low

I'm his fan
Cheering front, front row
His love is the center of my attention (ooh oo)

[Pre-Chorus:]
See, I don't know
What he'd do for me
That guy is my everything

We argue
We fight
Then we make up by the end of the night
Don't even speak it
Speak it
We know what we got

[Chorus:]
And I love him, he loves me
And this is how love should be
I'm down for the love that he got that
He got

And he stays down for the love
That we got
That we got

I love him, he loves me
And this is how love should be
I'm down for the love that he got that
That he got
And he stays down for the love
That we got, that we got

[Verse 2:]
He's embedded in Myspace
Everytime he speaks
He blows me away

Don't care what people say
As long as he's in the same place
Where I lay

See, I'll be his echo
I'm his princess
He's my general
And no matter what you think about love
Time won't outlast us

[Pre-Chorus:]
See, ya'll don't know
What he do for me
And I'm telling you
He's my everything

We argue
We fight
Then we make up by the end of the night
Y'all don't know what we got

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
The miles I'd walk
For him are infinite
I'll run circles around the world

And everyday I'm beside him
Feels heaven sent
And all else is irrelevant
So keep on [?] your love on to me

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
