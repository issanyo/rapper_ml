[Hook]
Tron, tron, tron, tron, tron, tron
Used to, used to, used to
Used to nigga, I used to owe that rent
And used to talk that strap
15 million of an umbrella
And I said fuck that
Fuck I look like hating on rnb nigga
I an rnb nigga
Used to ride that ‘lac
Now I ride that Ari
Push the botton Atari
To the o zone I’m start
Fuck I look like hating on rnb nigga
I an rnb nigga
Let you niggas get high for a minute
But I be hot for a century
Let you niggas get high for a minute
But I be hot for a century

[Verse 1]
I pull up fucking that 2 chains
My 2 chains
My bad, I need 4 chains
Look like a nigga sell dope maine
Coke maine, cook right over that propaine
Me and you like these niggas
We just don’t smoke the same
Don’t see us nigga, just throw c’s nigga
With the beats nigga, we overseas nigga
That cheese nigga, that mula, that mumba
Heard y’all niggas ain’t fucking with me
Kiss my ass, muah!
Notorious, big nigga

You been saying the same rap for 10 years

Put it together by myself Voltron
Put it together by myself Voltron

[Hook]
I used to owe that rent
And used to talk that strap
50 million of an umbrella
And I said fuck that
Fuck I look like hating on rnb nigga

Used to ride that ‘lac
Now I ride that orange
Push the botton to start
To the o zone I’m start
Fuck I look like hating on rnb nigga

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna to be hotter in this thang
When I’m running it, when I’m doing it
While you doing her, doing her, schoolin her
Fuck you yeah, you and her
Stand up, so cover up
Bathroom and I’m shitting on you niggas
Tallest stools
Balling shot calling
My daughter’s too next generation…
My son’s got a good record, fuck use the motto
Check the mail box, super roll everyday
I’m sick of winning, I’m sick of spending
I got pockets on them, for my grades on them
Music genius, I’m the nerd…
Telling this, moron
Put it together by myself Voltron
Put it together by myself Voltron

[Hook]
I used to …the rent
And used to talk that strap
50 million of an umbrella

Fuck I look like hating on rnb nigga

Used to ride that ‘lac
Now I ride that orange
Push the botton to start
To the o zone I’m start
Fuck I look like hating on rnb nigga
I an rnb nigga
Let you niggas get high for a minute
But I be hot for a century
Let you niggas get high for a minute
But I be hot for a century
