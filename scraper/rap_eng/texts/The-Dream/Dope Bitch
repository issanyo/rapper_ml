Hoop Earrings
She’s my favorite baby
Watch her do her thing
Out here in the world
Her body calling me
Like AT&T
Hater girl
They ain’t got nothing on you

[Pre Hook]
So fine, so hot, so cold (yeah)
Beautiful, so bold, for sure (yeah, yeah)
Pretty little thing, I’m glad she’s mine
And I mean no disrespect by this next line

[Hook]
(I gotta) dope bitch
(I gotta) a dope bitch
(I gotta) dope bitch
(I gotta)a-a dope bitch

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Number threes
She ain’t in heels she walking round here
Dope like me
Cocaine, persona?, marijuana
Wish you would like trees
Sold on her like kis
Feeling all on her like keys
So it seems
(It’s whatever you want)
You got it baby
The dopest thing I’ve seen
I’m hooked on you like d.o.p.e
Like d.o.p.e

[Verse 3: Pusha T]
She dope like the shit up in my car
Feds came and she put it in her bra
So I sponsor Isabel Marants
Instagramin' everything she flaunts
Knows when to cut up
Know when to shut the fuck up
Know when to smile
And knows when to act stuck up
She like to talk who got it who gettin’ it
Which nigga all talk and who spendin’ it
She only like sports if she court side
And hoppin’ out the Panamera Porsche ride
She the Bonnie to my Clyde
The perfect somebody on the side
My dope bitch

[Hook]
(I gotta) dope bitch
(I gotta) a dope bitch

(I gotta)a-a dope bitch

Dope bitch, my dope bitch
A dope bitch, a dope bitch
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch
Dope bitch, a my dope bitch
I’m glad she’s mine
