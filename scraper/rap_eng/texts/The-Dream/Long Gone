[Verse 1]
Yeah, nahh no no
I don't know how to please you
Everything was lookin' up and now it's lookin' down
And I don't know what I'm supposed to say
It seems your mind is on the other side of town
And I don't know what I'm supposed to do
Another day with you is just another fuckin' day
Somebody please tell me what to say
Or is it ok to feel this way?

[Bridge]
'Cause I don't know about us anymore, no matter what my mouth may say
I don't know about us anymore, layin' beside you suddenly feel strange
If I say I love you, you gon' say you love me back
But the thing about that is so far from facts
See I don't know about us anymore, no matter what your mouth may say

[Hook]
'Cause your heart says long, long, long, l-l-l-long gone
Long, long, l-l-l-long gone
The heart says, long, long, long, l-l-l-long gone
Long, long, l-l-l-long gone
The heart says, long, long, long, l-l-l-long gone
Long, long, l-l-l-long gone
The heart says, long, long, long, l-l-l-long gone
Long, long, l-l-l-long gone

[Verse 2]
I forgot how to touch you
'Cause every time I reach, you pull away
Now I've forgotten how to fuck you
And now when you say my name it don't feel the same
But tell me how I'm supposed to hold you
Do you want to fix it or dismiss it? Baby just let me know
How I'm supposed to love you?
Girl stop acting like I'm tripping!
What y'all looking at? Mind your business!

[Bridge]

[Hook]

I used to love you babe
You used to love me baby
Now it's not the same
When your heart, gonnnneee, gonnnnneee
Long gone, long gone
Long gone, long gone
Yeah
