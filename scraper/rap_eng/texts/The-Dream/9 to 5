Boy, I want you to love me like the flowers love the sunlight
Don't stop
Oh baby, take me and touch me until

Do that, do that, do that, yeah
Hit that spot like you knew that, yeah
Rock me till I'm clueless, yeah
I'm foolish, yeah

I like when you work me like that
Like a 9 to 5
O boy work me like that
Make me feel so right
Yeah (x6)
