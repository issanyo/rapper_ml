[Intro: Lil Jon sample]
AT AT, what? AT AT AT, what?
AT AT AT, what? AT, don't stop, don't don't stop
AT AT, what? AT AT AT, what?
AT AT AT, what? AT, don't stop, don't don't stop

[Chorus]
I don't know where we going (I don't know where we going)
And I don't know what to call this (and I don't know what to call this)
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to (ahhhhh)
And I don't know where it's going (and I don't know where it's going)
And I don't know what to call this (and I don't know what to call this)
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to

[Bridge]
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump

[Verse 1]
Yo, she hit me with that killer
She make me spend that skrilla
Body tight for the summer
Get it, get it for the winter
Real playa niggas need something that they can lay on
That shit on my mind
I need something to spend my day on
And I love her like my niggas, my niggas, my niggas
She ain't 'bout my figures, my figures, my figures
And I can't live by these hoes
'Cause she the one I chose
Got the keys to the Benz
I don't even drive my shit no more
(I'm ready to...)

[Bridge]
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump

[Chorus]
I don't know where we going (I don't know where we going)
And I don't know what to call this (and I don't know what to call this)
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how it started)
But I'm ready to go (I'm ready to), I'm ready to (I'm ready to)
And I don't know where it's going (and I don't know where it's going)
And I don't know what to call it (ahhhhhhh)
And I don't know how it started (and I don't know how)
But I'm ready to go (ready to), I'm ready to

[Bridge]
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump

[Verse 2]
I know you feel me getting ready
'Cause you all that's on my mind
Tonight's champagne and confetti, hah
If you want, I'll stand in line
For a little loving
For a little bumping
I hope that you hear what I'm saying
I'm hoping and praying, I'll say it again, I...

[Chorus]
I don't know where we going (oh I don't know)
And I don't know what to call this
And I don't know how it started (I don't know how it started)
But I'm ready to go, I'm ready to (I'm ready to)
And I don't know where it's going (I don't know where it's going)
And I don't know what to call this (I don't know what to call this)
And I don't know how it started (I don't know how)
But I'm ready to go (ready to go), I'm ready to (ready to go)

[Bridge]
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
(Don't stop get it, get it, oohh)
Bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump (as we)
As we bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
Baby yeah, oohhh

[Outro: Lil Jon sample]
AT AT, what? AT AT AT, what?
AT AT AT, what? AT, don't stop, don't don't stop
AT AT, what? AT AT AT, what?
AT AT AT, what? AT, don't stop, don't don't stop
