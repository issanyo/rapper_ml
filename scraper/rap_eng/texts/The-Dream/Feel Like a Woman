I want you to rescue me
Take me from this misery
Put your arms around me, babe
Hold me close, please hear me say
(Ohh)
You really got a hold on me
(You do)
Right here is where I wanna be
(With you)
Boy, there's something I want you to do
Cuz tonight I wanna feel like a woman

I don't wanna compete
I just wanna be the only girl that you need
(Feel like a woman)
Boy, I want you to be everything to me
Don't wanna be deceived
(Feel like a woman)
I don't wanna fuss, I don't wanna cuss
I just wanna feel the love from both of us
(Feel like a woman)
Now I only wanna do what you tell me to
Won't you show and prove
(Feel like a woman)

If you're on your way home stop and buy me something
Boy, buy me a bag or buy me some shoes
Cuz this is a part of me I'm trying to get you used to
(Ooh)
(Hey, hey)
Boy, buy me diamonds
Buy me pearls
Buy me this
Buy me that
Make me fall deeper in love with you
I'm tired of screaming independent
I wanna start depending on you
Cuz tonight I wanna feel like a woman

I don't wanna compete
I just wanna be the only girl that you need
(Feel like a woman)
Boy, I want you to be everything to me
Don't wanna be deceived
(Feel like a woman)
I don't wanna fuss, I don't wanna cuss
I just wanna feel the love from both of us
(Feel like a woman)
Now I only wanna do what you tell me to
Won't you show and prove
(Feel like a woman)

Now I'm holding on baby
Your my life
Just lead the way boy
Treat me right
I, oh I
See, we can do this
Just be strong
I'm trying to tell you what a girl really wants
I want a man to make me feel like a woman
Yeah...(feel like a woman)
Yeah...(feel like a woman)
Yeah...(feel like a woman)
Yeah...(feel like a woman)

I wanna feel like a woman tonight
You know just what to do, oh baby
Cuz I am yours and you are mine
And we deserve each other
I want you to lead the way
Make me feel like a woman
