She been gone since three thirty
Been coming home lately at three thirty
I'm super cool
I've been a fool
But now I'm hot
And baby you won't get it
Now I ain't tripping (ha)
I ain't twisted (ha)
I ain't demented (ha)
Well just a lil bit (ha)
I'm kicking a---s
I'm taking names
I'm on flame
Don't come home babe

I'm breaking dishes
Up in here
All Night (uh-huh)
I ain't go stop until I see police lights (uh-huh)
She lose a man (tonight)
She lose a man (tonight)
She lose a man
A man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n

I'm still waiting
Come through the door
I'm killing time
You know bleaching your clothes
I'm roasting marshmallows on the fire

And what I'm burning is your attire
I'm getting restless
I'm getting tested
And I can't believe she is always out every night
And never checks in
Is she cheating?
Man I don't know
I'm looking 'round for something else to throw

I'm breaking dishes
Up in here
All Night (uh-huh)
I ain't go stop until I see police lights (uh-huh)
She lose a man (tonight)
She lose a man (tonight)
She lose a man
A man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n

I don't know who you think I am
But I really don't give a damn right now
If you don't come
Imma gonna huff and puff and
Blow this, blow this (oh)
Blow this, blow this
Imma blow this, blow this (oh)
Blow this, blow this
Imma blow this, blow this (oh)
Blow this house, house down
Dishes breaking, dishes breaking

I'm breaking dishes
Up in here
All Night (uh-huh)
I ain't go stop until I see police lights (uh-huh)
She lose a man (tonight)
She lose a man (tonight)
She lose a man
A man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n

A man, a man, a m-a-n
A man, a man, a m-a-n
