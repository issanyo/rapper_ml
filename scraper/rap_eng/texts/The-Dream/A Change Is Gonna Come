[Verse 1]
I was born by the river
In a little tent
And just like that river I've been running
Ever since

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will

[Verse 2]
It's been too hard living
But I'm afraid to die
Cause I don't know what's up there
Beyond the sky

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will

[Verse 3]
I go to the movie
And I go downtown
Somebody keep telling me don't hang around

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will

[Verse 4]
Then I go to my brother
And I say brother help me please
But he winds up knockin' me
Back down on my knees
There been times when I thought I couldn't last for long
But now I think I'm able to carry on

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming
But I know a change is gonna come, oh yes it will
