And the other nigga was like "Man fuck that nigga"

[Hook]
Girls like you turn men like me into haters
And I must admit it, been acting like a hater

Soon as she said she had a man, I was a hater
As long as I'll get you, I'll be a hater
Until you say you love me too, I'll be a hater

How did one look at you overtake the kind heart in me?
