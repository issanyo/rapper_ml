[Intro]
P-party music, party music
P-party music, party music
Party music, party music
Party music, party music

[Chorus]
Turn me up, turn me up
Turn me, turn me, turn me up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn me up, turn me up
Turn me, turn me, turn me up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm goin' out tonight, it's goin' down
Headin' straight to the front of the line, on the fly
On the floor I can't stand still
And I'm goin' to work like I'm playin' my bills, bills
My whole clique's on the floor
We're gonna party then party some more, some more
Ros√© up in the air
Feelin' good, feelin' great, just got paid

[Pre-Chorus]
And they playin' my jam, they playin' my jam
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam

[Chorus]
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, DJ
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
So I can rock the night away, away

[Verse 2]
I'ma burn it out tonight
It's goin' down by live via satellite
And all I see is angels in my eyes
And the buzz got me way up in the sky (bye, bye)
Maybach in the front, front
Pick out any boy that I want, I want
DJ, here I am
Feelin' good, feelin' great, just got paid

[Pre-Chorus]
And they playin' my jam, they playin' my jam
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam

[Chorus]
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, DJ
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
So I can rock the night away, away

[Bridge]
Girls in the building, fellas in the club
Boys spendin' money, the girls lookin' good
I'm on the floor, livin' my life
Feelin' so good, I'm feelin' so right
Got my hands up, celebrate like it's my birthday
Five more shots of tequila, I'm thirsty
Feelin' so good, I'm feelin' so great
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam
They playin' my jam, they playin' my jam

[Chorus]
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
Turn it up, turn it up, DJ
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
So I can rock the night away, away

[Chorus]
Turn me up, turn me up
Turn me, turn me, turn me up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn me up, turn me up
Turn me, turn me, turn me up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn me up, turn me up
Turn me, turn me, turn me up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Turn me up, turn me up
Turn me, turn me, turn me up
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
