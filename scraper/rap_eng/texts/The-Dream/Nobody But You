[Verse 1]
I'm all wrapped up in his arms
But you're the one I really want
Truly he's the nicest guy
But I want you and I don't know why
We fought more than Tyson and Holyfield
Something about us felt so real
Now I'm next to dude
I don't want nobody but you

[Hook]
I don't
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you
After all you put me thru
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you
After all you're still my boo
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you
After all you put me thru
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you (but you, eh eh)

[Verse 2]
I seen you in the store yesterday
I was hoping you would look my way
In line with things I used to buy us
Reminded me of me and you
I'm still wondering how I feel
So strong about something I left last year
It's scandalous how I sleep beside dude
But all dream of is you

[Hook]
I don't
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you
After all you put me thru
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you
After all you're still my boo
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you
After all you put me thru
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you (but you, eh eh)

[Bridge]
You got me sittin', right here
With my back facing this man
You're tormenting me, in my serenity
I can't get you outta my head

[Hook]
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you
After all you put me thru (eh)
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you (you)
After all you're still my boo (eh)
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you (don't want nobody but you, eh)
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want
I don't want nobody but you (but you, eh eh)
