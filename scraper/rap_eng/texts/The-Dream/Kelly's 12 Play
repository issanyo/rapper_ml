[Verse 1]
Now I'm looking through my CD collection, yeah
The last time it was right behind Confessions, yeah
I'm looking for the white cover
The name's in the red letters
Can't wait to pop it in my Bose
And put our bodies together, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Im fixin to stunt like my daddy up in here
Girl you got my lips hangin' off your ear
Clean the CD, check for scratches
Get up on my mattress, now we doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play

[Chorus]
You can't ruin it, while doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play
Like a DJ, we screwing it while we doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play
Ooh, ooh, ooh-in' it, while doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play
Your body's the cup my body's the coffee
And I'm brewin' it, while we doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play

[Verse 2]
We gon' come up off that bed
Push up to the dresser, yeah , yeah
Got her all up on my CD player
Skip, skip, skip-skip-skip-skip-skip
Skip back to seven, yeah
And we both sweatin' it out like it's a fire up in here
Reach my hand out to the remote
Gotta play that one mo again
As we repeat steps 1 through 12
She like, "Thank you Dream"
I'm like, "No, thank you Kells"

[Pre-Chorus]
Im fixin to stunt like my daddy up in here
Girl you got my lips hangin' off your ear
Clean the CD, check for scratches
Get up on my mattress, now we doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play

[Chorus]
You can't ruin it, while doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play
Like a DJ, we screwing it while we doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play
Ooh, ooh, ooh-in' it, while doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play
Your body's the cup my body's the coffee
And I'm brewin' it, while we doin' it
To Kelly's 12 Play

[Verse 3]
CD spinnin', I got you in the mood
Everything he say; Ima do
And I'ma keep it gangsta and stay true
Baby I promise, just hear me through
So let me hear those ooh, ooh, ooh ous
We're almost at the end girl let it out
12, 24, 36, 48, If you up for 60
Shawty press play

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm stuntin like my daddy up in here
Girl, you got my lips hangin off your ear
She pops out the CD
Pops in another
We under the covers
And now we doin it
To Dream's Love Hate
