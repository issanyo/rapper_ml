Take me away to a strange and foreign land
And leave me to be - let me lay my head down on the sand
We're reachin' out for something special, our minds may never know
It's the kind of place we dream of and then let go - ah please
I'm OK, you alright, just the same every night
Living for the here and now, yeah yeah, yeah
I love it, you love it, we love it - letting go, no no
Come on and
Take me away, come on and take me, come come, and take me away
Take me away to a better place than this
Sometimes it's better to die than to live
I will not miss all the hurt I feel around me these eyes have never seen
And the lines between the words we seldom mean - I mean words like
I'm OK, you alright, just the same every night
Living for the here and now, yeah yeah, yeah
I love it, you love it, we love it - letting go, no no
Come on and
Take me away, come on and take me, come come, and take me away
I'm living today just like every day
Come on and take me away....
