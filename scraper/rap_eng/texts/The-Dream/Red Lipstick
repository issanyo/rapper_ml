[Verse]
Red lipstick, all on the paper
Lemme take a hit while you sit and watch
Go 'head, talk shit, it's all in the papers
Lemme grab my dick while you sit on top
Do ya right here while the whole world's watchin'
All up in my mental, gotta get up in my physical

[Pre-Hook]
Don't know what you did
But you really got me feeling
That feeling tonight
All on you, babe
'Cause you really got me feeling
That feeling tonight
I want you, babe
Got me going cray
Hard to let it go, let it go
Just show me where you want me, baby
Can't fight the feeling
'Cause you really got me feeling
That feeling tonight

[Hook]
Can't fight the feeling
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
(What I like, can't lie)
I just can't fight the feeling
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
(Do whatever you like)
Can't fight the feeling
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
(You're gonna learn tonight, oh)
Can't fight the feeling
Can't, can't, can't fight the feeling, yeah
