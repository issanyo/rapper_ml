[Intro: The-Dream]
You try to make her wyle out
I just make her wyl out, wyle out

[Hook: The-Dream]
She don't love you cause if she did
She wouldn't be all on my phone right now like that's my dick
Nigga she don't love you cause if she did
She wouldn't be all in the club reppin' like she my bitch
Nigga that's my shit, you can't stand it but that's my shit
Don't need to be dramatic but that's my shit
Let a nigga try to come behind me
She met you while tryna find me
Try to never mind me
Ain't gotta remind me boy that's my shit

[Verse 1: The-Dream]
You tryna make her wyl out, I just make 'em wyl out
I put that pussy in the rain, you put that pussy in a drought
I make her wanna stay, you just make her wanna leave
She want me to put a ring on it, with you she don't wanna be seen
We've been places that you'll never, ever, ever go
I know shit about her that you'll never, ever, ever know
I know how to push that button, trust me yall just fuckin'
And you gon' say that you don't care but I know you give a fuck

[Hook: The-Dream]
She don't love you cause if she did
She wouldn't be all on my phone right now like that's my dick
Nigga she don't love you cause if she did
She wouldn't be all in the club reppin' like she my bitch
Nigga that's my shit, you can't stand it but that's my shit
Don't need to be dramatic but that's my shit
Let a nigga try to come behind me
She met you while tryna find me
Try to never mind me
Ain't gotta remind me boy that's my shit

[Verse 2: TI]
I call and she comin', you call, hit the button
Love it when I shove it and I have it all in her stomach
You the type to act "why you ain't call me or nothin'?"
And I wouldn't have that bitch in the mall with me for nothin'
You keep petty conversation
We know two words, orgasm and penetration
Big dawg, ball to the wall, goin' all in
Send her ass back to ya, hope you fall in
Kick it with her ratchet friend, you took all ten of 'em
With ya to the club and got 'em all in, scrub
Bet anything that you would give one day
To know the life a real nigga live one day
Know what it like when niggas fuck with you for real for running yay
And can still hit the streets and get a mil in one day
So bet bet, if she met the king
The only thing you could be is the next best thing

[Hook: The-Dream]
She don't love you cause if she did
She wouldn't be all on my phone right now like that's my dick
Nigga she don't love you cause if she did
She wouldn't be all in the club reppin' like she my bitch
Nigga that's my shit, you can't stand it but that's my shit
Don't need to be dramatic but that's my shit
Let a nigga try to come behind me
She met you while tryna find me
Try to never mind me
Ain't gotta remind me boy that's my shit
