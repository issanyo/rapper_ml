[Intro]
I wanna be in your fantasy
A fabulous ecstasy

[Chorus]
Hey gorgeous, hey gorgeous
Niggas like it but they can't afford it
And you dumb thick, you dumb thick
You're the freak of the week with that bomb shit
Now you fucked up, doin' dumb shit
Like fallin' in love over bum dick
Hey gorgeous, hey gorgeous (Whoo!)

[Verse 1]
Ooh, girl, you're the moonlight of my night
And I never saw the starlight shine so bright, ooh
Ooh, girl, could set the night on fire
You sure know how to make me feel alive, uh
Ooh, girl, in that midnight fire
And I'm ready to knock you out if that's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can do this anywhere
Here or there
I don't care, ooh na-na-na-na
All alone, I'll put on a show
Still be all in your, ooh na-na-na-na
Back and forth, up and down we go
On that rodeo, ooh na-na-na-na
24. all week, (We) on the peak

[Chorus]
Hey gorgeous, hey gorgeous
Niggas like it but they can't afford it
And you dumb thick, you dumb thick
You're the freak of the week with that bomb shit
Now you fucked up, doin' dumb shit
Like fallin' in love over bum dick
Hey gorgeous, hey gorgeous
Hey gorgeous
Gorgeous

[Verse 2]
Ooh, girl, I love that white on white
And that lace hang off that thing just how I like (Just how I like)
Ooh, girl, let's take our love offline
Leave it all behind, make this all the time
Me and you forever

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can do this anywhere
Here or there
I don't care, ooh na-na-na-na
All alone, I'll put on a show
Still be all in your, ooh na-na-na-na
Back and forth, up and down we go
On that rodeo, ooh na-na-na-na
24. all week, on the peak (ooh, whoa, baby baby)

[Chorus]
Hey gorgeous, hey gorgeous
Niggas like it but they can't afford it (They can't afford)
And you dumb thick, you dumb thick
You're the freak of the week with that bomb shit (That bomb shit)
Now you fucked up (Oh), doin' dumb shit (Oh)
Like fallin' in love over bum dick
Hey gorgeous, hey gorgeous
Hey gorgeous

[Bridge]
I wanna be in your fantasy (Yeah yeah yeah)
A fabulous ecstasy
And this is where everybody else go for they, intermission, but
We just keep that shit goin'
Grab that towel
You ready?
Yeah
We gon' do it like this, like this now
I need it, I want it, and not just 'til the morning
And I hope you feel the same, I hope you feel the same
'Cause I need that pretty face next to mine, babe
And when I wake up next to you, see my need, ooh yeah

[Chorus]
Hey gorgeous, hey gorgeous (Oh)
Niggas like it but they can't afford it (No, no, no, no, no)
And you dumb thick, you dumb thick
You're the freak of the week with that bomb shit
Now you fucked up, doin' dumb shit
Like fallin' in love over bum dick
Hey gorgeous (Hey gorgeous)
Hey gorgeous (Hey gorgeous)
Hey gorgeous
(Oh, I wanna be in your fantasy
A fabulous ecstasy)

[Outro]
Do it (do it), do it (Do it), do it (Do it)
Beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
Shawty speed it up, speed it up, speed it up
Nigga beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
(I wanna be in your fantasy
A fabulous ecstasy)
Shawty speed it up, speed it up, speed it up
Nigga beat it up, beat it up, beat it up
Shawty speed it up, speed it up, speed it up
(Oh yeah)
