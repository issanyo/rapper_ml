While I'm... sunk in that 745.. IL
Feel like a jet when I ride (when I ride)
So I ride nigga feel me on cruise control
Game tight nigga lose your ho
I smoke... take a few pulls of the reefer
Ridin under the tint doin the duece fever
Need some so I check the beeper
Before B.I.G. pasted he passed the number to Katrina
Get it right the game still remain
And I'm married to the shit, you niggas still engaged
Nothin change, twelve gauge still POP!
If you niggas wanna jump at the ROC!
You can come witcha BLOCK! If you want to
Yea Ease the same
I bet it all on dice so I could freeze the chain (now thats game)
All you hoes is a show (your truck come with a chaffeur?) Ma fa'sho
You know Ease the truth, they say sex is a weapon
You'll be dead when I shoot

Fuck a vest, tell ya boys have a bullet proof truck with'em
It's Geda K the young horse, and M. Ease of course we gettin cheese
Draw we don't squeeze, and SUV's on two-fours with t.v.'s
Probably with your bitch, playin the backseat
And you know I hit it, ain't the type to chill with it
Type to get rid of and never go to the crib with her
Shit, I move according to plans and still visit... park
And still kick it and pick my niggas up
And you know we be dro smokin, toten, loc'n
Live from BR-double-O-klyn, bitch its Get Low let me know whats up

Uh Oh..

And lock the streets again, ain't no policing him
Got cops on the payroll, killers on the lay low
Niggas be careful what you saying on that radio
I Nextel radio niggas have 'em at the radio before you exhale, nigga
The cats out the bag, but blast out the mag
Send them words back in your mouth, out ya ass
Talking shit, all you get is cleaned the fuck up
I ain't steamed the fuck up either
Hire the team of me, myself, and I-rene
I come through and lean you fucker, I'm trying to keep niggas from killing you
You still talking shit to me, you not as smart as you appear to be
I got dum-dums for dumb-dumbs
I'm a bright man, got a educated left hook in a right hand
Fuck like whoa, got a flow like damn
The new thug life be the Roc-A-Fella fam
No disrespect intended
But if you offended can't take it back; handle your business
I'm just stating facts, the whole worlds against us
And we will not surrender, and we will survive
Turn out ya lights like Teddy Pender-Grass
Get ready for the coldest winter as, I proceed..
