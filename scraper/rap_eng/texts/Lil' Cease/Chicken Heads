[Verse 1]
I'mma tell you how I want it, ahead of time
Lettin you know, Cease ain't givin no dough
All you get is the sneak preview, the freak show
Some La, last some mo, head to go
I don't need dough to own that ho, you get it?
Anotha nigga never will I owe, you get it?
In the video, the five we flossin in it
How I know every one that you had was tinted
Admit it, six O-O see me in it
Sunroof open, I'm smokin, haters rock wit it
Bithces cluckin, hopin they could go for a ride
Get a lady by my side, when we puff La
If a nigga try me, shit, rather die
She said her favorite song was, Ebony and I
The dick make em happy, I'm they baby daddy
Flossin in the 6 yeah, me and Puff Daddy

[Hook]
Just a little....(a little bit of sex is all it takes)
A little bit of head I'm on my way
Six naw shit col. I don't play
So lets have an orgy
Let me bust a nut all on your face
Give me 2 minutes and I'll be straight
If you freaky, can my man get laid?
So lets have an orgy, girl

[Verse2]
Ey yo, when my nut drop it's gon be sweet as candy
I'm so for real, thats why them bitches can't stand me
Cease a Lee, nuttin sweet, real nasty, and classy
My Iceberg pants, they stay saggy
Black Navy, I fuck hoez cuz they nag me
That was back when I didn't have a pot to piss in
Now my nigga Blake gettin head in the Kitchen
I'll bust off and get to missin, listen
If you ain't a freak, I don't need ya
I want a real bitch, that suck a dime out a parkin meter
Read the scripture
When I stroke, It's like I'm in a picture, Kodak
I love a bitch wit a pussy clean like, Flo-jack
I'm stuck in 86, still call my dick, my Balzak
Too young, stick it in these hoez know that
You wanna stay or roll?
Here's a .9 here hold that
Bust up on yo face, lips, tits and all that...

[Hook]
I said Just a little....(a little bit of sex is all it takes)
A little bit of head I'm on my way
Six naw shit col. I don't play
So lets have an orgy
Let me bust a nut all on your face (all on yo face)
Give me 2 minutes and I'll be straight
If you freaky, can my man get laid?
So lets have an orgy, girl

[Verse 3]
Yo, when the smoke is gone who they focus on?
When you hear the Mafia, a nigga know it's on
Call me Cease A Leo or Cease a LeLO
Long as me and Rock fuck bitches by the trio
Put that on my nigga B.I.G, Never will I be no
Cat ridin around in a nast ass Geo
Not even a year in the game, getin the range
And hoez give me head just for hearin my name
I been on three tours, mansion, three floors
Why should I have a bitch when I could see yours?
Before you start some shit, be sure
Cuz I still got Murda Mamiz down in B-More
Catz play me sweet cuz they see me grinnin
And I got a easy livin, fuck easy women
We aced out, take anotha G from the linen
A nigga day dream about the V's he be spinnin
Bitch
