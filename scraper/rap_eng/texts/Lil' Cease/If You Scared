What the fuck could you say to me?
About to do it major league
A lot of niggers locked cause the suckers just afraid of me
Who said to me a big … lot of bitches dig wreck
Homie keep hating, he gonna get his fucking wig wet
… want a face fight, catch him on a late night
It could be 6 in the morning the daylight
Every time he see me like a … he gonna take flight
Took over the script cause you wasn’t moving base right
I see that you clueless, let me show you how to do this
I’m a hustler at heart, motherfucker I’m the truest
Cause way you were sitting all along, I can move this
All I gotta do is make a couple maneuvers
Nigga like me I know the fiends and the users
But the same time is move things on both cruises
Niggers don’t want war see them throwing deuces
…wreck it’s gutter music

You come up in the game or you better be prepared
Get out the grind if you scared
When the beat was on the popping why you busting in the air
Get out the grind if you scared
When the shit hits the feds, your ass is never there
Get out the grind if you scared
Nigga you’re gonna rap or your ass will show crack
Get knocked on the street … it’s a rap

I’ve did been through it all, it ain’t much I don’t fear
And I don’t deal with gossip so fuck what you hear
And I can kill less with a … gota say
The more these niggers talk, the more I think they gay
They play for my downfall, what more can I say
They wanna see me dead or see my ass locked away
I’m just trying to fuck a bitch and smoke a pound a purple day
And I … night, but I’m biggy all day
Everything is hard body, … the logo
… aka call me k solo, yeah I rap for dollo
Niggers state your state
I do it for the real g’s the ones that relate
It’s hard body leo yes sir, I’m a boss
… to doggy diamonds yeah, you keep me on the forbes
And little kim clap clap round of applause
… yes, yes …

You come up in the game or you better be prepared
