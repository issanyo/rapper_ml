[Lil' Cease]
Yo, yo, yo
You wanna contemplate on Ceasileo the great
My motto fly states any where pick a date
Your man light weight, holding like a cake
With him comes the drama he like scared straight
I wanna girl who really don't sweat no stars
I wanna girl who can drive and not crash my car
I wanna girl that understands that what's mine is ours
I need a girl who could help me with these 16 bars
Come on

[Kelly]
Can't explain this feeling
I want you all the time
And soon I'll find a way
To make you mine
(Oh, gonna make you mine)
So baby, yeah
I wanna spend my life with you
So tell me, yeah, yeah
Can we share forever, baby
Oh, there'll never be another like you
So give me your love

1 - 	Your love is driving me crazy
	Your love always on my mind
	Your love is driving me crazy
	Your love always on my mind

I can't explain this feeling
You are the one for me
Can't see another day without my baby, yeah
So baby, yeah
You can make my dreams come true so please

Say you'll stay forever, baby
Oh, cuz I just can't go on without you
So give me your love

Repeat 1

Baby I'll show you the way that
I feel about you
The things that you do to me
I'm longing for the way you touch

[Lil' Cease]
QB, Rockafella, yo yo yo
You wanna front on the fly romancer?
Leo ganzer the sickest thing since cancer
I get my girls after, eat 'em good
Treat 'em good then I"m ghost like Casper
The game and the baby face
Got these hookers gassed up
But B.I.G. told me to watch broads
With they ass up
Told me that they spread that love
That niggas pass up
If they write like Kelly Price
I'll tear that ass up
If she's not that hot then I'll give that ass up

Repeat 1 until fade
