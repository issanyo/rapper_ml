Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt...

Cease know, all his hoes, go to my door
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more...

Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-A-Leo...

We just chilling, milk 'em, "Top Billin'"
Silk and pure linen, me and Lil' Cease...

I'm here, me and my man Cease-A-Leo
We just gon' do our thing forever, forever and forever...
