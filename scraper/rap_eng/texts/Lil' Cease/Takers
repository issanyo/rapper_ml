[Verse 1]
I’m a take it and with the strikers light it
Niggas talking cold as an ice cream
That nigga ain’t no killer if we hit them with ice cream
Like a bitch niggas ain’t no G as a crime scene
Strip him off the block took his watch and his light
Chain the call me Leo D we ballin in the night sand
Represent Brooklyn that’s where we were crowned king
Seventeen shots from the block but just one aim
We take it if you think something sneak we get you
Niggas ass stucked like two dogs in heat then we
Tie niggas up to the hands and the feet we can take you
To the streets leave them dead in the sheets
We going to take it we disrespect the rules we just
Just leave niggas like Houston music
Box and bruise and we do it all for a profit
It’s hard body RIP a robbery in progress

[Hook]
We take it from the bottom to the top
From the jet to the Jot from the land to the yacht
We gon take it from the grams on the block
Keeping hands on the Glock keep your eyes out for the
Cops we gon take it from the bottom to the top
From the jet to the Jot from the land to the yacht
We gon take it from the grams on the block
Keeping hands on the Glock keep your eyes out for the
Cops we gon take it
