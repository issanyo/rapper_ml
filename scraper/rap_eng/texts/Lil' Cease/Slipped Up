Lachie Dawson just shot me a text
Tryin flex he had a hickey on his neck
Wait you just dissed Slips FM
But tried to make out you’re gonna play for Michigan
Bitch you can’t even make the school starting five
Unless your last name was a Tresize
But shut the fuck up jimmy and josh
Fucking gay ass twins
Jimmy you look about three
But I bet you take your brothers fucking D
Zac McMinidick sucked up to Mr Gaze
Tyler got cut from stingrays

Yooo yo yo, hold up hold up
Dr DLight this may be the beat I want
But it ain't the beat i need
Yo Light spin dat shit

And now onto Papa you’ve got big fish eyes
What the fuck is up man shit is supersized
Man you always looking like you’re surprised
And now you’re putting up your hand screaming “mum's life”
It’s Lil No Dad coming at ya hot
Talking about Dawson always flexing that watch
Bitch you think you’re rich as fuck but you’re just a mummy’s boy
Leeching off your dad whilst you suck his toy
This bitch thinks its Sesame Street?
Big Bird looking motherfucker going balls deep
But only in his pants though
Got those Gucci’s on and he’s making those stains gross

Quabby’s up next, and it's time for you to get dissed
Putting up those snaps of you getting so pissed
Smelly pits, chubby fist, lay off the fucking Schnitz
Must feel so tough but you’re looking like real a bitch
But I feel bad for Luke what we're doing here is sin
But it ain’t my fault that my car weigh just as much as him
Luke I think it's time for you to to hit the gym

And now that it’s the chorus it ain’t time to click off
All our haters are queers and knockoffs
But what we’re about to say is gonna make your frown
Cause we still got another verse and shits about to go down
And as Gandhi said once that left us all in stitches
Light Cease and Dad ain’t a sucker for you bitches,.


Time to wreak havoc on a pussy made group
Now let me run you down cause here's the scoop
Your Lil Noonga gang has a nice collection
Of curries that share the same sized little erection
Y’all try and walk around like yo shit don’t stink
But you’re borderline a crew, what do any of you think?
Now onto the Indian that wears a satchel
Niv you’re white don’t inflict this battle
You R. Kelly, From New Delhi with a big fucken belly
If I had a penny for every time you ate healthy
My shitty life would not be very fucking lengthy
I’d be doing anything but driving my Bentley
Mark your cousin Anthony is a stumpy guy
Mark gives his cousins the sexy side eye
Vassan says he’s gonna start to hit the gyms
Coming from the guy who sinks when he swims
Every time I see a minor disagreement going down
All I see is the Noonga gang quickly rundown
Almost as if you dumb queers run the town
You guys are powerless, and nothing but brown
You single race gang, leave the world some space
About time somebody put y'all into yo place

And now that it’s the chorus it ain’t time to click off
All our haters are queers and knockoffs
But what we’re about to say is gonna make your frown
Cause we still got another verse and shits about to go down
And as Gandhi said once that left us all in stitches
Light Cease and Dad ain’t a sucker for you bitches,.

Chris remember them boys at that party?

Yeah don’t lie you wanted to kiss em
Now you're cut cause your fantasy was left begging
You the kinda type to go and study at Chisholm
Light bring the beat back I already lost my rhythm
And now I’m gonna start right where I left off
Hynd shut the fuck up I think you’re soft
Look at Niezgodka acting like he got power
Judging by your hair you don’t even shower
Matty Russell with his fat lambs
Safe to assume he sells 3 to 4 grams
Hayden and Simeth have no fucking brain
When they were kids all they got fed was cocaine
But don’t get us started on Daryl and Shane
What you did to us is just inhumane

And now that it’s the chorus it ain’t time to click off
All our haters are queers and retarded knockoffs
And fuck all the shits that said that the slips are dead
Cause now all your faces have turned a deep shade of red
And as Gandhi said once that left us all in stitches
Light Cease and Dad ain’t a sucker for you bitches

And now who's gonna return a track that’ll mess with our riches
None of you will cause you’re all our bitches
