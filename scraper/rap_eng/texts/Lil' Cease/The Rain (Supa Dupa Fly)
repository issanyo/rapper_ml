[Intro: Missy Elliott and (Timbaland)]
[Yawning]
(Run the track)

[Hook: Missy Elliott and (Ann Peebles)]
Me I'm super fly, super dupa fly, (I can't stand the rain) supa dupa fly
Me I'm super fly, (against my window) super dupa fly, (I can't stand the rain) supa dupa fly
Me I'm super fly, (against my window) super dupa fly, (I can't stand the rain) supa dupa fly
Me I'm super fly, (against my window)

[Verse 1]
When the rain hits my window
I take and *cough* me some indo
Me and Timbaland, ooh, we sang a jangle
We so tight that you get our styles tangled
Sway on dosie-do like you loco
Can we get kinky tonight
Like Coko, so-so
You don't wanna play with my Yo-Yo
I smoke my hydro on the D-low

[Hook (Ann Peebles)]
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I I can't stand the rain against my window)

[Verse 2]
Beep beep, who got the keys to the Jeep, vroom
I'm driving to the beach
Top down, loud sounds, see my peeps
Give them pounds, now look who it be
It be me me me and Timothy
Look like it's bout to rain, what a shame
I got the Armor-All to shine up the stain
Oh Missy try to maintain
Icky-icky-icky-icky-icky-icky-icky

[Hook: Missy Elliott and (Ann Peebles)]
I can't stand the rain
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I can't stand the rain)

[Verse 3: Missy Elliott and (Ann Peebles)]
I feel the wind
5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
9, 10
Begin: I sit on Hills like Lauryn
Until the rain starts coming down, pouring
Chill, I got my umbrella
My finger waves these days, they fall like Humpty
Chumpy, I break up with him before he dump me
To have me, (I can't stand the rain) yes you lucky (against my window)

[Outro (Ann Peebles)]
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I can't stand the rain)
(I can't stand the rain)
(I can't stand the rain)
(I can't stand the rain)
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I can't stand the rain against my window)
(I can't stand the rain)
(I can't stand the rain)
(I can't stand the rain)
(I can't stand the rain)
