[Hook: Mark Keds]
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
It's like we stuck in a prison
Suffering from lack of wisdom
Suffering from lack of substance
The systems lacking some ism
Since it's killing the misery
Hope my children remember me
Since I sing songs of symphony
Somethings just gotten into me
Message, don't kill the messenger
Message travel through seven seas
Ghetto passion is classic, been getting lashes for centuries
Aided, but mostly separated by color deficiency
Free to you, free the shackles, my mental strain from my ancestry

[Hook: Mark Keds]
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

[Verse 2: Meechy Darko]
Emancipation, castration, mass-hating, white washing
Black shaving patience, that I'm demonstrating, ugh
Segregation, separation, take my people, chain my people, ship them out, build a nation
Picket lines, demonstration
Kill switch, detonation, this takes dedication
Guess the NBA our reparation
Governmental medication the reverse of levitation
They put fluoride in our water
Guess they trying to kill our babies
Hearts racing, cops and robbers car chasing

[Hook: Mark Keds]
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliot]
Whatever your purpose is
Hone in and hold your kids
All of this is distractions and nobody notices
Fiending for knowledge we still in chains
Power tripping for digits we growing it every day
Fighting for free computers in service for student aid
Can't afford to be sick pay more them pills to get paid
Taught to follow the system that institution be prison
These coppers turn me to zombie
I'm walking dead while I'm living

[Hook: Mark Keds]
I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains with ease

I feel so tired of the lights
Fill the tank with gasoline
One match to burn these chains they weave

[Outro: Erick Arc Elliot]
Break the chain, break the chain
Why the violence is killing our kids and our brother man
Break the chain, break the chain
How police war with no recourse and you on your way
Break the chain, break the chain
Still identify with those who's have nothing still live in fear
Break the chain, break the chain
Been distracted by the glamor but don't question why we even here
Break the chain, break the chain
Why the violence is killing our kids and our brother man
Break the chain, break the chain
How police war with no recourse and you on your way
Break the chain, break the chain
Still identify with those who's have nothing still live in fear
Break the chain, break the chain
Been distracted by the glamor but don't question why we even here
