[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
I always liked the Spice Girls
Was never into nice, too-polite, clingy-type girls
You texted me them broken hearts, just say what's on your mind, girl
I see them three dots, for three minutes, go ahead and type, girl
Always into weird, feared, dark-type girls
Independent, "don't need no nigga, keep on they light" girls
Don't mean to be cliché but I like girls, that like girls
That like girls, that like—huh
I'm into "hood-type, ain't afraid to fight" girls
That be like "dead-ass" or "I put that on my life" girls
Them scam-type girls, "Take me to Barney's," straight swipe girls
Them gang-type girls, pass at the rager, see swipe girls
I'm into philosophical read-your-mind-type girls
That stay woke and eyes stay low from all the—ah!
Girl you more petty than pretty, get-the-last-laugh-type girls
And hey, I'm in your city, what you doin' tonight, girls?

[Chorus: Dave B]
Make sure the blind on the windows is closed
I swear you only hit me after my shows
What I fall into, it's the God in you
I could drown in your holy water, ooh
I'm only here for one night so who knows
It's that time all the homies, them chose
What I fall into, it's the God in you
I could drown in your holy water, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooohh, ooh, ooh, ooohh)
I could drown in your holy water, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooohh, ooh, ooh, ooohh)
I could drown in your holy water, ooh

[Verse 2: Erick Arc Elliott]
I wanted to rekindle this flame, man the rainstorm
Water her flower while making this moment ours
This combination exceeds the limitations
In all of our conversations, should validate love is sacred
Beauty, not cosmetical, manufactured aesthetic
It's magical when you get it, most'll love to forget it
In modem but spoken ethic, our future together heaven
However, love is all the things that ties the severe
Knowing this union that formed between us is the same reason
Your parents connected that time at the party as so-and-so's
Imagine all of this over Bacardi and Moet, bro
I'll be the heroic, she rollin' up something potent, though
And now she wanna hold my hand and shit
I ain't into that but dawg, I can manage it
Used to make me sick, now you make me sandwiches
I'm in this world without a girl will make a man forget
How could I forget?

[Chorus: Dave B]
Make sure the blind on the windows is closed
I swear you only hit me after my shows
What I fall into, it's the God in you
I could drown in your holy water, ooh
I'm only here for one night so who knows
It's that time all the homies, them chose
What I fall into, it's the God in you
I could drown in your holy water, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooohh, ooh, ooh, ooohh)
I could drown in your holy water, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooohh, ooh, ooh, ooohh)
I could drown in your holy water, ooh

[Outro: Meechy Darko & Erick the Architect]
Fuck with me, I'm a big deal
Before we fuck, I strut to that pussy like Ric Flair
Girl fuck with me, I'm a big deal
Take you to Benihana's and leave a tip for the meal
Girl fuck with me, I'm a big deal
I'll show you ecstasy's real, only no ecstasy pill
Girl fuck with me, I'm a big deal
Drinking that blue with you, so baby let's just chill
