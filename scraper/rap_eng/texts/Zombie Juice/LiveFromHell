[Intro]
La musica de Harry Fraud

[Verse 1: Meech]
Reportin'
Live from Hell
Hovi told you we was welcome
To sell, donâ€™t run and tell
Unless you want your heart to fail
Unless you want small with the real potato cutter
I, peel flesh on, hands and feet
And dump you in a tub of salt, sheesh

[Verse 2: Zombie juice]
Smoke yuh, burn up, psshh yoga flame
Zombie mahfucka, prepare for the reign
Shreddin through the world, slightly feel pain
Open up yo eyes, life is just a game

[Verse 3: Meech]
You don't like my music, well I hope you fuckin' die
Grab that pistol, kiss it, put it to your temple
Chris Benoit (kiss sound) Kiss of death your gum
Maricon, carry on
Lucid dream of feelin' martin, pain smoking Tommy Strong
My chick a gully jawn
She suck with a skully on Olde English and Jordan 1's
Cuz, my cup done runneth off like
Red pill, blue pill, plug in-plug out
Gang yo mouth, if shit shay, your out

[Verse 4: Zombie juice]
We ain't at the top, but we made men
Started from the bottom, seven grams and the blank disc
My ex girl wanna fuck, but I ain't rich
I saw myself die once, what a nice trip

[Verse 5: Meech]
You say you want the highest, well I am him
No such thing is a loss, so I reap on his grim
The demons bleed through the pen
The canvas drips from the sin
I mind bend spit shit to make a mannequin cringe

[Verse 6: Zombie juice]
Obnoxious like Nazis
Smackin' paparazzi like Kanye
Pardon my cocky, can't stop me
I'm on a million, the feeling I'm feelin', look to the ceiling
Smoke cut with the building
Buildin' a billion, fuck everyone who said that we couldn't
Dab city bitch, strollin' through your hood
Juicy long beard stroke the kitty like I should
Scalpel, cut yuh, ease yuh' like my dutch
Four fifth, morbid
Psychedelic, raw shit

[Outro]
Zombies existed across all cultures in mythalogical selections
And their imminent arrival is all but fortold in all the religious texts
My advice... "Sharpen your sword"
