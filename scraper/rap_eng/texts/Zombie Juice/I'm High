[Intro: AK]
Higher than I've ever been x2

[Verse 1: AK]
Uh, UA to the fullest
Took an eighth of shrooms now i feel like dodging bullets
It's a armageddon and I'm Bruce Willis
Here to save the day with a spliff to the face
Now let's drift to a place
Hidden in natures taste
This is rebirth all your sins are erased, erased, erased
This is rebirth all your sins are erased
Now remember today and the way that you sway
And the feelings that you felt
All the way to the grave
And explain to your friends that you cannot explain
Tell all these hoes that you can not be tamed, tamed, tamed
Tell all these hoes that you can not be tamed
Straight kush in the dutch no reggie
Super ghost, I told you already I'm

[Hook: AK]
Higher than I've ever been
Eat the shrooms up
Light the kush up
Tryna find us
Nigga look up
Uh, Uh, Nigga look up
Higher than i've ever been
Shrooms and Kush
You just tell your friends
Get up roll it up
Be one with the wind
And if you come down we gon do it again

[Verse 2: Juice]
Chillin in the condo
Yea my eyes low
Cali, Weed, Ciroc with the purple, Kush
Hit harder than my words though
I bring the heat
Im packin like Alonso, D Wayde or LBJ
C'mon C'mon girl gimmie head gimmie brain
They know I'm bout to take off, First class
Running like Diddy, Your ass on fire
I ain't busta rhymes, hittin notes like mariah
When I'm in the gina, big dog you just a minor
And yeah young bull
Im higher than i've ever been
Sweat-pants, hoodie and a pair of timbs
Headband Kush
With two foreign twins
Hit the blunt one time if you finna get
Higher, Higher, Higher, Higher

[Hook]

[Verse 3: AK]
Blunt two, the skies are purple
Like the weed i roll
Now here i go
All i took was three pulls
And my eyes were low
Like I'm chinese
Me and the kush we're siamese
Swallowed some shrooms just so i could make the time freeze
This feeling is the greatest, No Ali
Don't you spy me
Just look in the sky cause that's where i be
I be
On a never ending journey for the worthy
Enlightenment express, mama you don't have to worry
I'm still your son, but my minds so old
Make it hard to act young, what have i become
Stuck in the mind state
Of I'm great
So im high like DC's crime rate
Straight kush in the dutch no reggie
Super ghost, I told you already I'm

[Hook]
