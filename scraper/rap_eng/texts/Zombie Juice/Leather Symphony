[Verse 1: Zombie Juice]
She just want me like a wedding ring
I keep her dripping like some fucking paint
Money real, I'm smoking hella green
So much ass like Teyana Taylor
Run a trap tryna make a milli
She make it clap tryna make a milli
Don't lose yourself, remember who yourself
Don't lose yourself, remember who the best
Take a dab, she got hella ass
I just smoke and I don't never pass
All these niggas tryna be the man
I get green nigga, Peter Pan
Why they hating nigga? I be living
Why they hating nigga? I be pimpin'
Bad bitch looking so exquisite
Took a risk, double, triple, get it
Third eye feel like it's on fire
These niggas singing like they on the choir
Swisher blunts with Snoop Dogg
Dogg Pound, woof woof!
No sound, psh psh psh!
Wipe me down cause I'm gorgeous
Ric Flair with the horseman
What you bout man? Quit talking
Bout that work, I'm like Fergie
My moms didn't make it 'til 30
If I don't make it, don't worry
Zombie Gang, we ain't buried
Nigga always been a helping man
Don't bite the hand that makes you understand
I might go loony, catch you on the 'gram
Flipping, shipping, got a hundred grams

[Hook: Zombie Juice]
Bands, grams
Caught a jux and do my dance, yeah
Why they copy? They just fans, yeah
On my momma, I'm the man, yeah
Bands, grams
Count it, count it, got my hands full
All this working got my hands full
Why they hating like some damn fools?
Bands, grams
Caught a jux and do my dance, yeah
Why they copy? They just fans, yeah
On my momma, I'm the man, yeah
Bands, grams
Count it, count it, got my hands full
All this working got my hands full
Why they hating like some damn fools?

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvyy]
I'm a minute late, I'm a renegade
Twelvyy got a gauge, let me penetrate, pussy power KKK
Loaded it live, rock in my sock
Patrolling the block with a Glock
Stick to the code, bloody my O's
Study my notes on the floor
Stuck on this odyssey, huh, alone I need privacy, huh
Shooting my prophecy, only I can see everything I can be, huh
Fuck it, I get it, I get it
I chronicle Riddick, they couldn't forget it
Planning is hella specific
Start the beginning, a glorious death for the ending
I can't believe I existed, I'm bout to lead with a vision
I brought the heat to the kitchen
Y'all bout to sleep with the fishes
I run with the Pistons and beatin' them kittens
Zombie the menaces, all of my nemesis
Wrong on the premises
Brother got sentences, I'm moving sinister
Call in the defenses, Twelvyy ridiculous

[Hook: Zombie Juice]
Bands, grams
Caught a jux and do my dance, yeah
Why they copy? They just fans, yeah
On my momma, I'm the man, yeah
Bands, grams
Count it, count it, got my hands full
All this working got my hands full
Why they hating like some damn fools?

[Verse 3: Zombie Juice, A$AP Twevlyy & Both]
Mecca like Malcolm (and Biggie Medina)
A$AP the cleanest (rolled in the Beamer)
On Amsterdam, feel like I'm Yams, can't see me, John Cena
Everything money and violence, went to Flatbush for a nina
Live up on Lennox (Church Ave with the check)
Made no casino, got dope in the ringo, we high like the Beatles
Album gon' pop (live on Atlantic)
All over the planet, in Crooklyn we bandits and Harlem do damage

[Hook: Zombie Juice]
Bands, grams
Caught a jux and do my dance, yeah

On my momma, I'm the man, yeah
Bands, grams
Count it, count it, got my hands full
