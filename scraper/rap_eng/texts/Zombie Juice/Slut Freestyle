[Verse 1: Cadet]
Boom, so a big part of my life has been chicks
No, I can't lie about that
But for you to understand, I gotta take you on a journey and bring it right back
Me I'm talking about Chestnut Grove
I'm only gonna tell man facts, a young nigga, hairline intact
Yeah I was gettin' the gyaldem like that
See me I was the man in school, but it's like, I was so up my own arse
My teacher could tell me come to the front, I'd get a pen and try teach the whole class
I had four girls but two wives in school, and that was Cherise and Tara
And now I follow Tara on Twitter and trust me (tuts)
I shoulda chose Tara
Anyway I was all young and dumb
I weren't tryna' fuck, I was tryna' grab bum
A young nigga tryna' have fun, you know? Happy slap or grab phones and run
Now I'm making a name on the streets
And fam the first time I had sex was peak
Bus' so quick I didn't know that I beat
Hmm, ayo the kid was a neek, what you know about me though?
I had one message I'd copy and paste to every girl that's on Bebo
And profile pic too man I was wrong, but that's when this shit got long
It might sound like I'm going off topic but now I'm gonna tell you how I was a dog
Cause then I went college and I linked up with my boo thing
And I took her off of one light skin youte, who wouldn't fuck but we'd do things
And I cheated on her; she took me back and then she left me as you do
You know if you take a girl from someone, she can get taken, from you
Now these times she's doing her 'ting but she won't tell me that it's over
And my cousin he pree'd the whole 'ting but he's moving like it's kosher
And I can't lie, that fucked me up and that might be why I turned cold
Cause she done that monkey bar 'ting, where you swing on but you don't let go
But it's all good though
But it's on now (woof), I guess I'm a dog now
Tryna' find bitches like a dog pound that will blow me like they wanna get snot out
I will keep it one hundred with you, ay fam I don't know my body count
I've had bare exotic 'tings, even had a mixed race ginger I knocked down
How many gyal have I beat now? Lost count, I ain't even talking 'ucky
I tossed outside some girls, most man would drop out, but I'm tryna' buss my ting quick and knock out
And I would rock out, with my cock out, see I was moving scatty
And true say I'd be Cadet, Cadet, a lot of these girls would throw pussy at me and yeah I caught it
Dreams that I sold, yeah some of them bought it, but they couldn't afford it
And I ain't even talking about bare abortions, that's a deeper subject, don't worry I'll talk it
These girls, I wouldn't even have to move up, but I'm still picking them up like an Uber
I beat one, that chick say I'm a user
Cause I'd get around the whole team like a rumour
And I remember having gyal on the BB, that said if you don't wanna' beat, delete me
Believe me, enough of dem' girls were freaky, I had girls in sections wanting DP
Never once did I get an S 'n' TD
I guess I got lucky that my mum is a GP
Seems B, but they don't give them BD, like they automatically wanna' get neeky
Me I've had girls say that I'm broke, but they've seen what I make in a night
And I've heard that my dick is small, but they still complain I hurt their insides
And I even had girls on Twitter, talking like I ain't got change
But the same girl said she'll commit suicide if I don't make time and see her in the day
See me, I ain't brought a girl home and my family's thinking I'm nuts, even the last girl I called wifey
Something about her I just couldn't trust, I just want the girl I bring home to be the only one that I do
Just because you might call me a slut, don't mean there ain't shit I ain't been through
Like, when I got my ex-pregnant, been there I woulda' had to
But her parents are Moroccan, so they just saw me as a black youte
Now, Alhamdulillah I'm a revert, but no they didn't care about deen
They said culture should go with culture, you know?
And that's just how shit be
Now she never told her fam, and I never wanted kids from the start
But the fact that I never had a say, and that's what really sat on my heart (like I don't have a say, no?)
Like some real shit, that shit there had me stressing
Cause bare people can't have kids in the world
So who are we to say no to a blessing?
Uh, and when I think back in the days, of course, I woulda changed it
Cause I'm lucky I ain't got a BM, like them other youtes that were dressed in the same shit
Uh, and I swear if God gives me a bag of tots
What are they gonna say to my daughter?
When she doesn't know what her daddy was? I mean cuz, see I was nuts, I was out here tryna' buss nuts
I'm thinking of meeting girls for the first time and they got with a man that be fucked
It ain't about who you go bed with, it's who's there when you wake up
But you ain't gotta take my advice, you know, cause I'm just Cadet AKA the Slut
