[Intro: Joey Bada$$ & CJ Fly]
Badmon
Yo, Pow', this a really great beat
Yeah

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Got my leg up out the window, ay
I'm just flexing if you didn't know, ay
I see stars when I look up, ay (look up)
Niggas talk that talk until I pull up, ay ('til I pull up)
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up

[Verse 1: Meechy Darko]
Two freaks, one of I
Capricorn vs Aquemini
Slow creep like a orgy
Acid, acid, that's a different high
Roll fronto like pronto
I'm saying baby this a different vibe
Send nudes while the Benz cruise
Skrt skrt, never hit reply
Pussy dripping now I'm baptized
She got me changing religions, woah
Up, down, left, left, right
Mami be hittin them swishers
Don't kiss me there girl, I'm ticklish
Backseat gettin toppy, uh
Money bag like Monopoly
She do it better than most do it
Cause she figured a nigga got options
Pick up my phone like, "Who is Simone?"
I'm sayin, "Girl I don't know nothin'"
But really I don't know nothin'
Bust a U-ie down your block, uh
Middle fingers to the opps
Spittin loogie like I'm Pac but
I'm more Biggie on my block, cuh

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Wha-what can I say man? Most these boys are fakin'
Pull up by myself, if I want it, I'ma take it
Pull up, vacation, pull up in a spaceship
Feel the vibrations, I'm feeling amazing
Sold out tours from the rely, woo
Big pimping, call us UGK
I'm a real nigga nigga, real nigga drip drip
I might kill one these niggas, pill one us then get
Baby pull up, Juicey need what
She sittin' on dubs like a truck
I ain't got head in a month, I just been working like a dog
Feeling like I need me a Minaj
I'm talkin' bout Nicki in a thong, all my life been livin' for the cause
All my life been leanin' to the stars
Money over bitches 'til I'm gone

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
Got my leg up out the window, ay
I'm just flexing if you didn't know, ay
I see stars when I look up, ay (look up)
Niggas talk that talk until I pull up, ay ('til I pull up)
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, ay
Until I pull up

[Verse 3: AKTHESAVIOR]
AK pull up like a trainer, uh
Drop top, I call it no brainer, uh
Shorty keep sendin' me praises
I got the name but, no, I cannot save her, uh
Heard about a nigga like a rumor, woah
Broke ass rappers need a tuneup, woah
When they play the record, turn the tune up
Throw the trash niggas in the can like tuna, woah
Bought a new whip just to show the progress
But I still steal your bitch in the same process
Please do not push me, I know 'bout the ledge
You number two when I pull out the lead
Chillin in the coupe, all white, seats red
Lookin' like I opened up a white chick's head
Old girl text but I leave that shit read

[Verse 4: Issa Gold]
Uh, kick back, sip, push the whip real slow
Nigga drop four like it's Tic-Tac-Toe
Bruce Leroy watch a young nigga glow
Pulled up, real clean, super flex that ho
Woah, said she like snow in her nose
Top down nigga while I light my smoke
Feds on the creep but them niggas not low
Had the shit in the stash they won't find my dough
Woah, bet you can't do it like this
Old school shit, Super 8 my whip
Cop two fifths, crack a seal, she lit
Shorty looks scared, I won't crash my shit
No, Beastcoast niggas don't fold
Four leaf clover, my ducks in a row
Big Range Rover, yo we plowing through the snow
Meech and Juice in the twin Lambo
