[Intro]
It's been said that when you're one step ahead of the crowd, you're a genius!
When you're two steps ahead, you're a crackpot
In this era of discovering suddenly hundreds and hundreds of exoplanets
You know planets that are like Earth that can conceivably support life
That’s a major discovery, you’ve got to admit
In terms of the probability of life being discovered

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Lot of niggas never get through
A lot of niggas never get you
Thanks for the compliments
Only boosted my confidence
Make tunes for the in-tune
Smoke joints when I skip school
Like I shot from a pistol
Christians 'cause they pissed too
On point can’t see that wealth
And I wonder if I could ever just be myself

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
Alter perceptions, reality of questions
Psychedelic mushrooms, DMT sessions
I’m on another trip, ain't gotta get to stepping
Your windows in your eyes, the doors to perception
Broken homes, broken souls
Hurricanes, overdose
Crowded jails, for the weed sales
Conspiracies and casualties
Universal consciousness
My third eye swollen like boxing mitts
I ain’t a Muslim 'cause my beard so thick
Inspired by the light, the creator's gift
Sometimes I feel like I cease to exist
In the physical trapped in my head
Tryna open vaults back from the dead
You’s a God, just what I say

[Verse 3: Erick Arc Elliott]
Say, one day I was okay
'Til a nigga decided to look it both ways
I never got a chance never co-paid
Chilling with the fam and the homies
Niggas wanna talk reckless
Don’t rely on the police to protect us
Nigga gimme your watch, your bitch, and your necklace
Then I'm taking your life forget your inception
A healthy track record

[Outro: Meechy Darko]
This is rage
Everytime I try to write this I ignite my fucking page
If yo walk don’t match yo talk then we on a different page
This is rage
Everytime I try to write this I ignite my fucking page
If yo walk don’t match yo talk then we on a different page
This is rage
Everytime I try to write this I ignite my fucking page
If yo walk don’t match yo talk then we on a different page
This is rage
Everytime I try to write this I ignite my fucking page
If yo walk don’t match yo talk then we on a different page
