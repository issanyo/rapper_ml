[Intro: Sample]
Life, real life, that thing that we have been denied for far too long
Good morning my neighbors!
(Hey, fuck you!)
Yes! Yes! Fuck you too!

[Bridge: Bonnie B & Bodega Bamz]
Fuck you too
Pay for your goddamn titties, bitch
Fuck you too
The fuck you mean, so what I ain't [?]?
Fuck you too
Yeah I was out all last night, so what? What the fuck that mean?
Fuck you too
I just want my dick sucked, what's wrong with that?
Fuck you too
I wanna come home and get my back rubbed, what's wrong with that?
Fuck you too
I'm paying every motherfucking bill in this motherfucker
Fuck you too
Bitch shut the fuck up!

[Hook: Bonnie B]
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, nigga, nigga
Nigga fuck you too

[Interlude: Sample]
I just thought that I'd clean up just like you guys
But now, see I'm washing lettuce
Soon I'll be on fries, then the grill
A year or two, I make assistant manager
And that's where the big bucks start coming in

[Verse: Zombie Juice]
Find me smoking good up with my niggas tonight
Find me smoking good up with my niggas
And mami looking good I'm trying to get her tonight
Mami looking good, I'm trying to hit her
And I just wanna fuck you baby, let's keep it simple
This is not a record, this just me here with my people
I know I'm something special, but my eyes swole like my ego
Fuck you and your people, your mama and her [?]
That and, that and, back and forth again and
Fuck you, I love you, another finished sentence
Goodbye, oh my, Henny bottle for life
Talking 'bout some money well, I'll be that nigga for life
Smile in all my pictures if I want, I love my own life
Obsessed with pussy, alcohol and money, living this life

[Interlude: Bodega Bamz]
(I feel sorry for your mama)
Man what the fuck you said about my mami?

[Hook: Bonnie B]
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, fuck you
Fuck you, nigga, nigga
Nigga fuck you too
