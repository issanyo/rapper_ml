[Instrumental 1]

[Verses: Meechy Darko]
Every motherfucker with a gun ain't a mobster (facts!)
Every bitch with an ass ain't poppin' (facts!)
Every beat with an 808 ain't knockin' (facts!)
Bring it back please rewind this
Every rapper with a platinum plaque ain't a problem (facts!)
Every nigga flippin' packs ain't a hustler (more facts!)
Everybody buy 'cause profit ain't always progress (faaacts!)

All these new wave niggas lyin' when they rappin'
When they really just be talkin' about some shit that never happened
Same niggas rapping 'bout same whips, same fashion
And bitches tryna' get real love with fake asses (Haha!)
Chase asses, mind and your body got an equal the rule over the second
I think the side track I figure, I mentioned
Last chick i had super bad, but you burned me (facts!)
Thank god it wasn't herpes!
Lazy bitches screaming where the surgeons at
Now black girls off white, like Virgilâ€™s brand
Then you got these fake gangbang niggas on the 'gram
Snitchin' on themselves via cam
Excuse me I think Juice laced my weed again
I don't trust nobody, no not even my (self)
That's why I keep a condom on my (dick)
Before I leave the (crib)
You can't buy no bitch's love, boy there are always bigger (shrimp)
If she with you 'cause you fuck her she gon' find some better (dick)
Bitches party, party, party, like the spring break (effect)
See your booty on the 'gram and never pictures with your (kids)
Why your uniform so dirty and your timbs are scuffed to shit
Meanwhile, you are on vacation every weekend is (lit)
Niggas buy jewelry, buy jordans, buy bema, buy rova, buy rolex, buy gucci, buy louis, but you can't buy culture, nigga not my culture

Hey, ok
Lavish nigga expensive habits, nigga dramatic, nigga type to straight flip out and stab a nigga for a penny
Eventually he gonna win grammy nigga, the Plan-B giver
Won't see me in the family picture backwards
Fella hit the weed then beat the beat
Like Adrian Peterson to be his seed, her head so good that I invested in a guillotine
This is me, six feet deep, crabs in a bucket to kill my brother just to hit my peak it's sad but it is the way it be, savagery
Invest in carrots to cover my cavities
Paranoia sauce to capture (me), semi-automatic (me)
Blasted by the sheets enough to alter your reality
Don't let the reception be your reflection keep your balance G
Try to find the symmetry in the midst of calamity
My eyes glow red, like that room in Amityville
Be real, bitch I'm wit, pussy so wet nigga need gills (real deal)

Excuse my aggression my tribe call for questions
If I'm made in god's image why am I blemished
Two white lighters I made it through twenty seven
Zombie Gang, dead niggas throwing out like Hendricks
Die on the set, like Bruce and Brandon
A stranger is just a friend of an enemy you haven't met yet
But Satan was once an Angel, you don't you forget that
I gots a do what the fuck I want fetish
Name a nigga nicer, I slice and dice his life
On the mic, I rhyme like the life on the line
Do suicide, so me and Biggie and Big L can solve Mr. Ouija
Can Pac see me writing these lines?
Those ain't loses, those is lessons
Count my sins, but skip my blessings

I have some more for these niggas

I coulda been in the Wu, coulda been in the Commission
Coulda been in Tha Dogg Pound knockin' all the buildings
Coulda been a hot boy I'm already gold grillin'
Coulda been a Public Enemy tryna' make a difference
Hennessy gallons an enemy, blurred my vision
Drunk drivn', hit a dip and swerve my nigga
Vivid shit, illiterates could see these words my nigga
I could do better, I think that she after my cheddar
I check the closets before I fuck just to make sure it's not a set up

I think I'm done I ain't gonna lie

[Instrumental 2]

[Verse: Eric Arc Elliot]
Hit me with vivid image I knew it
And my influence assuming that I do it
The choices could buy movement
My voice wasn't hallelujah
We praising the wild but losin
Discression advised when yo watching the cops in the two
Impossible and flawless
Renegades with the stake of fortune
If you can't relate you ain't on it
Chases Forbes list
Zombie gang running mates
For the 8th orbit
Crosshairs right there, you are the main target
Hardest artist, stain full of garbage
We their fathers
Proudest, killing their sons and their whole squadron
[?], shit ain't working out, this seem [?]
Armani style, versatile we be in the tropics
I told Flex "Drop a bomb if you hear a problem"
I'm all black like I'm dressed with the daily departed
Blur the lines, I ain't blurring mine
Scratch the surface
Headstone down [?] on your casket purchase
Rap is easy but this rapping shit it make me nervous
Are you that determined, 'cause you lacking purpose
What I'm 'posed to do?
You niggas too emotional
I'm not even a sane man, I just look approachable
Hit or miss, whole game stuck on their nigga shit
Head crack [?], like Ventriloquist
Cops got me hammed up, here's a stitch
Here's a situation, tell her for a nation we don't even get impatient
Time's a wasting
Foul talk is metaflagrant
This shit is basic dog, waiting for elimination
Just 'cause you got streams don't make your song hot
Just 'cause you got a nose-ring, don't make your boy 'Pac
Unemployed, but I'm still working like a auto-shop
Tired of them warning shots
Zombies skrt the parking lot
Breathe easy
Rap timid, the game needs me
Independent nigga still produce his own CD
Plaque form, black form, balling like a PG
Only nigga making beats is talking this greasy
Easy, Arc'll bust a chest like a beatie
Been a long time 'til you niggas come and see me
Last time is on the line my Knicks niggas need me
Been around the back like I travel with a team, B
Niggas whole career, AirBnb
Need to see recepits
Don't own a [?] or a proper tee
Imockery, keep few grams in my pocket tee
Fiends blow my high but my pride ain't stopping me
Word to blabla why you lying to the Socrates
Raised dynamic like the range of my knocking beats
Architect and my man Flex on the Hot 9
Niggas out their pocket while you craining for the combine

[Interlude: Zombie Juice]
Yeah, April 6, Vacation in Hell
It's getting hot, it's getting hot baby, too hot

[Instrumental 3]

[Interlude: Meechy Darko]
Zombie Gang in this bitch
Vacation in Hell, April 6th
I think I just fucked your bitch
Yeah, let's get it bitch, yeah

[Verse: Zombie Juice]
Pass the weed now, I'm smoking by myself
I'm Kobe in 24 and I don't need no help
Hardest work, bag it up, I don't need a scale
Fuck the cops, fuck the ops, I don't sleep well
Now I heard they snitching, trying not to see sales
Blessing the Lord, I'm living
Let's get 'em all familiar
All that king talk, 'gon end up in a river
Self reclaimed, ain't the same, you just in your feelings
Been the same, how y'all changed, look up in the mirror
I ain't playing nigga, this ain't Fortnite
Punch you in the face, motherfucker I'm spitting all night
They trying copy flex, these niggas all bite
Avianne diamonds, these shits is all bright
I'm really truely living, these niggas truly gimmicks
Imma keep going, icon living
Jaden Smith moon walks, high as John Lennon
Lucy in the sky, I'm just tryna touch some lives
Paint a picture, change the world, I'm just too hard to define
All these cops killing niggas, man that shit is out of line
They control us by the masses, still we living like we blind
Rest in peace Prodigy, Sean P and Big E
If he stepping out of line I paint him like [?]
Most you rappers out of time, I feel like I'm Big E
New day, big three, I'm black and I'm still me
Most you can't come up here, free Shmurda
[?] murder, free Meek
We the Zombies and you might not ever heard us
Sold out around the world, coke leaders set the quota
Hit the wave on them boys, four quarters
Steph Curry, [?] fonzarelli
Coolest nigga on the block, Santana, free the [?]
Me Against The World like 'Pac
Beast Coast coming gunning for that number one spot
Put it on my headstone, they just do it for the clout
And it seems like these niggas out of touch
Last stop, 2 train get your baby momma fucked

[Outro: Zombie Juice]
Last 2 train, Flatbush Avenue
Last stop, it's going back home to Brooklyn with it
Haha, you already know
