[Hook: Project Pat]
See I gotta die, man, don't you even try, man
Enemies gon' bleed once, I let these bullets fly, man
See I gotta die, man, don't you even try, man
Enemies gon' bleed once, I let these bullets fly, man
Momma's gonna cry, man, I like to get high, man
Niggas passing plates, snorting line after line, man
Momma's gonna cry man, I like to get high, man
Niggas passing plates, snorting line after line, man

[Verse 1: Remy Banks]
I be that nigga, when I step out on the scene they all salute a G
With air 10 Jordans, got your bitch seducing me
Blowing haze by the QP
Queens bound, sipping Hennessy
Drunk as fuck in the H.O.V. with an eye out for the police
I'm yelling World's Fair, my middle finger to the law
Catch me out in London with the queen bumping Kalashnikov
I know I'm flexing but fuck it, I like to gamble life
Cee lo king, 4, 5, 6, roll dice 'til I see paradise

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
A young nigga, made man
Smoke an eighth and roll eight grams
Ted Bundy on a ho, gain her trust then slit her throat
From the track spitting that murder
Bloody hand, bloody hand
Double Gang, got my evil tan
I drink some gin, yeah
Love the bitches, slutty bitches
Fuck them all 'til I'm bored of bitches
Red flag, red clothes
Mix the coke with some inositol
Cut it up, flip it up, niggas must got me fucked up
My hair red and my bitch blonde
Smoking while I get my dick sucked

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A$AP Ant]
Givenchy, my shirt bark
Burner ain't shy, it do talk
He out of line, go get the chalk
Target practice, play darts
That Baltimore to New York
Run that work like relay
Been had tracks for rap days
Niggas turned up like Gunplay
These rappers, all gay
A bunch of female bi-mix
Don't give a fuck what a hater say
Young niggas run everything
Model shorty, sniffing yay
I'm a throw 'em man, in her face
New niggas in first place
Leave a body, no trace
