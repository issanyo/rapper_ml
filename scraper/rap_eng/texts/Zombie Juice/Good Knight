[Verse 1: Kirk Knight]
Look, of course like no mail watch it keep my eyes peeled, reveal
Watch if five connection is too real
Word is bond positive and negative
Black executives like "Hey", just find words for sedatives
Ill never fishy
I never understood the ugly ones with the jewels or the yarmulke
Don't get clapped through the monitors
"But what's in store?" she said "BJ"
"Yeah, just for all of us"
Industry chicks get crazy for a little tip
Hennessy and wine glass lying say they only took a little sip
Ya'll look cute but a nigga just a crazy one
Life and whisky, take it with a grain of salt
Cats like us, stay miscellaneous don't forget watch it
Protect your neck stop it before you get stomped in
We light it up, keep it ultraviolet
Consider the key that's defying us, nigga

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Everything was good until reality struck, never thought reality could cut me deep like a fatality could
A fake salary like we ain’t eating that green
Mama my dream be king and I’ma be honored
But I'm beyond it, not being a sapien, I’m a supreme being when I be rhyming
Outshining the Muhammads and the 'Bamas cause I’m a Brooklyn bomber
Bringing the drama, start tuning your timers
No Hakuna Matata, wake up that goon or your medulla oblongata
Stop thinking what your tinking with
Hold ya bladder, save the blabber
Roll a J with some grabber take a plane to Allah with the shit that I'm supplying
Or put you on the road to Zion no lying
Yo' flow tiring, I'm a flow tyrant
The best with the grip to your neck no violence
The best with the grip to your neck no violence

[Verse 3: Zombie Juice]
Live from the underground, peep the style
Wild motherfucker, golden smile
Tryna stay level headed, hold shit down
Walk around, no crown, champion bound
Flatbush raised me, the drug game paid me
Yo' bitch I’m blazin, and smoking in the same speak
Bust up in her mouth piece, nigga there, no seeds
Steady toking green, walkin' with a lean
Life ain’t, life ain’t always what it seems
Never gave a fuck, good at getting out my dreams
Beast Coast, we been here, permanent ink flow
Got the choppers, pop yo' partners, fill em up like empanadas
Young man, any given day could be yo' last
Elevate yo' mind, intertwine visions from the sky
We heaven sent, Zombies motherfucker for president
Your wack-ass music little nigga irrelevant

[Verse 4: Meechy Darko]
Hash oil and joints, my ball pen on point
You clown niggas is doink
See we don’t fuck with the police
Na we don’t fuck with the oink, swank – what my niggas say?
Krill, what my nigga say? Click clack – blaow
Grip steel like what my niggas say?
Sometimes I want to ball up and die or disintegrate
Sometimes I want to reach for – the sky or levitate
Elevate, success in my spliff you might want to take a hit of this
At least get some contact, nigga take a whiff of this
These rap bitches sensitive – like my bitch's clitoris
Vivid like Tarantino, cinemas with synonyms
You ever met God, well shit nigga I feel like him
Shrooms and helium – dancing on the ceiling
High pitching I’m Doc Ellis, I’m in dirty white denim, polo my sweater
You are not that better, your shit not venom
I spit hot peppers – bitch!

[Verse 5: Erick Arc Elliot]
I really think I'm high up on the brim
Knowledge infinite, tell your friend send it, I will dial in
String shorty's violin
That means I'm a player for a sucker not a goddess
God’s got my back, but the Devil’s got my eyelids
Step up to the throne, still high off the hot shit
Never got the pass but I pass for a pastor
Free form thinker move crowds with my chapters
Not a funny actor, I'm backwards
I orchestrate through the pass like Mashburn
Heat for the Knicks, end of the spliff
Marijuana fine cut, like a boob on a bitch
Since a younger man, in my younger days I was dazed
By the days, I didn't do what I say
Now I'm determined to reign, fuck bitches and fame
I’d rather remain payed
Rich in the mind nigga keep your change
Rich in the mind nigga keep your change

[Verse 6: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, fellow niggas, mind wounded a rhyme student
Ignorant, grew up in it but fine to it
Moms knew it, Dad wasn't around for it
A bomb to it, my voice is just like the sound of it
Niggas ducking I'm looking over they noggin
You will never be the hottest you nothing more than a Robin
False information, lost and I'm wasted
This should be the time that you niggas should get it poppin'
Told 'em I was in here, I ain't never been here
Fuck it, I'm a put this knowledge to his bucket
Hating on me, tuck it
You a LeToya Luckett, you a sucker in disguise I can see it in your structure
OGs, give me game and it's on me
Smoke weed, meditate and be on key
Never no beginner I'm finishing every sentence
We the reason these new niggas is looking vintage
Making my entrance, clear the path
Niggas better get it right or I'm a have this fuck nigga feeling bad
Joey Bad, Kirk Knight, the worst night
You ever seen a Flatbush ZOMBiE in real life?
Walking the dead, off the head in disguise of a educated man's third eye
Word
