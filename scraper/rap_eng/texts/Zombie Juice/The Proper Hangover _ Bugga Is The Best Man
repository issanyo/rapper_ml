[Bobby conversating with someone]
- Hey Bobby, what happened to your homie?
- I don't know man, he was hanging out with my dogs last night, but I haven't seen him since
- You haven't seen him since?
I can get a hold of him on the telephone
- That's crazy, we went to "The Strip Club In The Sky" yesterday
- How were the ladies?
- They were in the sky
- Something bad?

[Erick waking up in the morning]
*Alarm clock rings*
Oh god my fuckin' head hurts so bad

[Narration (Erick Arc Elliott)]
Erick shows up to the wedding with eminent signs of
Drunken-fuckery and a definite sign of a hangover
Oh yeah, he's fucked up
He stumbled in late for the wedding and soon he finds out he's gonna have to deal with more than a little stage fright for the rest of the night. The worst part is, the rest of the band is already there and he don't even remember shit from the last night

[Erick's conversation with band member Lionel (Zombie Juice)]
- What's up, man
- Hey man, where have you been out all day

We've been here all day, waiting
