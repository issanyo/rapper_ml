[Intro: Erick Arc Elliott]
Hey, I'm just doing everything that I can (I can)
Never been jealous of the white man
Black skin, I'm not better, I'm just different
He ain't never sold drugs, this is all a false image, hey

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott]
Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under siege boy, that's how we do
And they know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth
Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige nigga, that's how we do
And you know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth

[Verse 1: Erick Arc Elliott]
Pay a load of tax, take it out your check, boy, I know you know this debt
'Til you hesitate and right before you purchase that
New chain, new fame, original black
We are well-anointed with the knowledge of the slaves
Land of the free, yeah, home of the brave
Hard to close my eyes at night, I'm dreamin' of the day
Dark terrors in the ferry, turn the world grey
Somehow we gotta pray, it ain't 'bout religious praise
This is real shit, nigga this is not a phase
Born afflicted, misinformed children on the way
Eyes teary, blind fury, cryin' to be saved
Find another way, while escapin', a rude awakenin'
While we caged in, abomination
Clean water for the cavemen, salutations
Signin' off with a Molotov
Throwing salt while we marchin' off for the common cause

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott]
Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige boy, that's how we do
And they know we keep a blind eye to hide the truth
Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige nigga, that's how we do
And they know we keep a blind eye to hide the truth

[Verse 2: Zombie Juice]
This a new world, artificial, second brain in my pocket
Tell me how that live through, y'all don't hear me
Unless I talk about my skin tone, and what comes with it
If you live it then you stand strong, that's how we do it
Ain't no father figure, live and learn
Gotta get the money, little nigga making earns
Another day, another cop killed an honest man
Black skin, young-aged, probably had a kid, it never ends
They say government control the weather
How we bustin' all these guns but we can't get together?
Start a unit for all this and make that bread together
Are they crooks? Are they pedophiles or politicians?
Plottin' FDA poisonin' our children now, that's how we living
Throwing niggas in prison, unlivable conditions
Repeat offender, brown, broke, that's the agenda
Never surrender, keep your eyes wide shut, nigga

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott]
Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige boy, that's how we do
And they know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth
Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige nigga, that's how we do
And you know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Say "God bless America"
To the red, white, blue noose on my neck, wylin' for respect
Guess freedom ain't free, huh?
Really wanna see a difference, kill some politicians
Red men get executed and forgotten
Black men spent 200 years pickin' cotton
Now they poison our minds and put shackles on our conscious
But they will never get mine, never get mine, dawg I promise
Black American Psycho, ya like Tae-Bo, ya might just get
American Dream be doubling the money with no minusin'
Hate is a disease with no paradise they can’t find that shit
Honestly this shit here’s wave make climate shatter thermometers
Promise my mama, I see mañana, no matter what it is
Coppers be killin' niggas for nada, that shit gotta end
You probably think slavery's abolished, homie they got your brain
Never forget what they did to the man with the moccasin

[Chorus: Erick Arc Elliott]
Who's the best American? Is it you?
And I say never love again, but I do
Whole planet under seige boy, that's how we do
And they know we keep a blind eye, to hide the truth

[Outro]
"We are all the problem, when we don't make sure
Our dollars stay in our communities for more than six hours
We are all the problem when we don't make sure
That our children are safe going to the public school to prison pipeline
We are all the problem
When we don't homeschool, our children, after school
We are all the problem when we lay down
And expect somebody else to do the work for us
We are all the problem when we don't stand up to oppression
We are all the problem if we go back into slavery
That makes us all the problem."
