[Verse 2]
Every weapon weh rise against we shall fall
Brim stone and fire, weh mi put over the wall
Father God say, mi fi preach it like Paul
Slew heathen like Goliath and Saul
(Mi can't believe) small axe make big tree fall
(Read a Psalms) and answer God's call
Make a joyful noise to the Lord, unto the Lord make a joyful noise
He that dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High shall, forever live and never die
Passion of the Christ, that make me start cry
(It's a shame) When mi see Peter deny
Judas betray the Most High
That's why me nuh beg friend and friendship me nuh buy
Nuff of them nuh miss the well until it run dry
Keep it Jiggy, mi a look to the sky
(Scoobay!)

[Chorus]
We a burn bad mind, for we hypocrites can't stay
(You too bad mind)
So we draw our line, and tell Satan, "scooby!"
(You too bad mind)
Kiss the cross and touch the sky (Christian dip, Revival dip)
All bad mind things must stop, we a burn out bad mind
(Christian dip, Christian dip)
(You too bad mind)
We a bun out bad mind
(You too bad mind)
A weddi, a weddi, a weddi, a weddi
