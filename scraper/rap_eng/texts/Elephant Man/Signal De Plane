[Intro]
Give dem di dance
Give dem di dance
Shizzle
Give dem di dance
Dancers from all over all parts of Jamaica

[Chorus]
Dancehall nice again
(John, Bogle, Keeva, Stacy)
People smile again
(Sadiki and the whole fraternity)
Do what you feel like, nuh fight it
Dancing nice-nice-nice

[Verse 1]
Dancing a Jamaica middle name
Visa fi go a England a strain
Immigration a call out your name
Nuh make your friend get buss, signal di plane
Signal di plane, mek wi signal di plane (repeat x2)

Hot Monday, turn every dance a class room

Sweep them up fast, class a go start soon

Da one yah new everybody haffi catch it soon

People line off like them inna the platoon

Soupy a boil fish tea, dash weh him spoon
Turn over the hot soup, bun up chiney June

Hotty hotty Cherry fresh like a flowers wah a bloom

[Verse 3]
Me nuh like the segregation weh a gwan
John and Bogle, a Jungle di two a unuh born
United we stand but divided we gone
Carry news dancer, lowe we an gwaan
I guess we'll be dancing from dusk til dawn
John touch di floor, we nuh see weh them gone
Labba Labba deh inna di middle, everybody swarm
We naw weed and grab fi we hand full a corn
Labba Labba may old, but still deh pon form
Through di dance, bad mind nuh stop carry on
Dem hate Fire Links thru him mek hype a gwaan
Who nuh waan come a Hot Monday, dem can gwaan
Da dance yah mek everybody a kick up a storm
Show Jack Sowah di brand weh yuh have on

Enjoy yuh self, nuh mek nuh body keep yuh calm

[Chorus]
Dancehall nice again
(John, Bogle, Keeva, Stacy)
People smile again
(Sadiki and the whole fraternity)
Do what you feel like, nuh fight it
