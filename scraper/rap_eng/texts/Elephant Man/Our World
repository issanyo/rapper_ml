Demarco, Elephant man
Baby G
Ah our world
Some boy a fi pay fi a live in a it
Elephant man them a fi shu off, feel!
Wa you mek yo fren them boots yo fa
You life will lose quicker
Beware me evil me get free from lucifer
Real eye shutter
Any boy we go fa
Boy head a roll in a gutter
Tell them say ah, our world
Some pussy just fi live in it, our world
If we start it you will finish it, our world
Rifle shot in every whole a it
And body dump in a pit ohh ohh
Coulda in a the wickedest place we a go fi them
Rise up the dog and clear way the puppy them
In a juvinile they a him a mek the duppy them
Tell them a our universe this a nuff fi them
This a our world boy shouda glad sight see it
And the price them a pay fi live in a it no cheap
Ball cheap and reverse whem the sweeper sweep
Boy wa love peek under come bury deep
Like the sun in a the morning half drop rise
Mi alive we have open brains and alot eyes
Drop sighs when he see the nozzle and me Glock size
In a mi blood mi gun will make them baptise
Tell them say ah, our world
Some pussy just fi live in it, our world
If we start it you will finish it, our world
Rifle shot in every whole a it
And body dump in a pit ohh ohh
Them no smart get caught no look weh dem start
Muma ball when the rifle tek them head appart
Pure evil nothing good na deh in a we though
Take way yourself like a flight a the park
Cause we dark we ignorant no head no heart
We will make blood run by the pint and quart
We govern the culb the south east west north
Blood bath front page all the media a chat
Tell them say ah, our world
Some pussy just fi live in it, our world
If we start it you will finish it, our world
Rifle shot in every whole a it
And body dump in a pit ohh ohh
