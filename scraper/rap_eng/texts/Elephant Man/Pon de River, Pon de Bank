2003
I'm just doing this for the kids and me
And my fans all agree
Keeping it real, doing the music for the fans
Elephant Man
I dedicate this one to all the dancers and...you know..the dancehall music fraternity
We just keeping it bouncing and..letting the fans enjoy themselves
It's time to party
It's January going up to February
And December, remember
Shizzle!
Elephant Man, I'm bringing love in the music, and joy and splendor
Dance!
