[Intro]
Some gyal cyan buy a body splash
Good gosh!

[Bridge]
Hot gyal from foreign and country and town independent and have them money
Some gyal say dem hot and cyan buy a body splash, well you know say dem gyal deh a funny

[Chorus]
Gyal, you ever smell clean from the day you born
You ever have up your cologne and your roll on
You never smell green like no old Tiger Balm
Nobody can tell you say you carry moldy arms
Jump up and scream from you know you're clean
You smell like Fendi plus Louis Vuitton
Some gyal say dem a queen, but a inna dem dream
None of dem cyan wear clothes dem weh you have on

[Verse 1]
Gyal!
Tell some gyal, dem cyan do wha' you do
You fresh and clean, dem smell like - mhm
Hotness cyan done, know that from Bogle
Some gyal not even hot like your poodle
Clothes, you have a bag of, you nuh wear no raga-raga
When you fresh and come out, you hotter than Lady Gaga
Have man head spin, gyal, with your clean skin
Any gyal waan fi compete tell her -

[Chorus]
Gyal, you ever smell clean from the day you born
You ever have up your cologne and your roll on
And you never smell green like no old Tiger Balm
Nobody can tell you say you carry moldy arms
Jump up and scream from you know you're clean
You smell like Fendi plus Louis Vuitton
Some gyal say dem a queen, but a inna dem dream
None of dem cyan wear clothes dem weh you have on

[Verse 2]
Air freshener smell clean, my girl, you smell better
A bere namebrand perfume deh pon your dresser
You hotter than pepper, you a real trendsetter
When me a spell your hotness mi use capital letters
'Cause anytime you come out, you're properly attired
Hotter than Beyonce, Rihanna, and Mariah
Every man a road say, you set them pon fire
A you a di man dem desire

[Chorus]
Gyal, you ever smell clean from the day you born
You ever have up your cologne and your roll on
And you never smell green like no old Tiger Balm
Nobody can tell you say you carry moldy arms
Jump up and scream from you know you're clean
You smell like Fendi plus Louis Vuitton
Some gyal say dem a queen, but a inna dem dream
None of dem cyan wear clothes dem weh you have on
