[Intro]
*Girl moaning*
Bedroom Bully style
*Girl moaning*

[Verse 1]
Turn her on Ele'
Gal bruk out pon the cocky, the cocky, the cocky
Bruk it off nuh, fatty
Open like a Ackee
Make me bomb it, like down at Iraqi
Sit down inna saddle, bend your knee, and ride it like a jockey
Ride it like a jockey, rev it like a Kawasaki
Fling her up!
Gal from Nagasaki say me flexible like Mr. Wacky
Come a flock it, so me send it up, bend it up in and shock it
Up in and shock it, me send it and buss one outta the Glocky
Make she tic tocky, go 'round inna circle like a clocky
Turn her on Ele'
Knee, me send in her, me not friending her
Me bending her, straight cocky wha' me send in her
Me bending her, cut out the talking anuh seminar
Like a rope, a so me long, mi cocky hanging her

[Chorus]
Gal a fly down, just like a bird, fi mi loving everyday
Gal, if your man lef' you lonely, come over and check me
Make me give you the 'conda!
Fly down, just like a bird, fi mi loving everyday
Gal, if your man lef' you lonely, come over and check me

[Verse 2]
Turn her on Ele'
Whine pon the stiffy, the stiffy, the stiffy
Whine pon the stiffy
Come on nuh Nicki, use the muscle of the kitty grip it
When me lef' it chippy-chippy, handle it like a hippy
Like a hippy under mi Guinness and a bag of cliffy
Fling her up!
Nah go get no quickie, nah go get no quickie
Me nuh ricky ticky
Fi you come a road and you and your friend a laugh, "keke keke"
What a calamity, it's a pity how dem gal yah look so pretty
How dem look so pretty, gimme one of the titty fi hickey
Turn her on Ele'
Show dem how fi position, whine pon the dicky
Badman nuh deady-deady, the 'conda nuh sicky-sicky
Me and pretty Vicki, like how Alison to Pretty Ricky
How mi chase the Hennessy with the Courvoisier

[Chorus]
Gal a fly down, just like a bird, fi mi loving everyday
Gal, if your man lef' you lonely, come over and check me
Make me give you the 'conda!
Fly down, just like a bird, fi mi loving everyday
Gal, if your man lef' you lonely, come over and check me
