[Intro]
Let Jah arise...
All enemies scatter!
Ghetto youths, as long as you believe in the Almighty, nothing else no really matter
Jah Jah...

[Verse 1]
As I lift my eyes to the hills
From where my help is coming down
Haters a put a fight
Me know dem woulda waan fi see you drown
So, you fi put your trust in the King
No time you nuh fi have no doubt
You badmind, better you lay low
And ask God fi save you now
Make me see your hands raising...
Inna the air and praise Him
From you know you're not faking
Open your mouth and shout it out

[Chorus]
Jah Jah keep bless we more
I'm surrounded by hypocrites
Plead our cause when we pray, Lord
Wicked must fade away
Dem badmind and think we nuh know
It's written all over dem face
So, plead our cause when we pray, Lord
Wicked must fade away

[Verse 2]
Hey!
When me look up, me pray fi the wicked first
True dem cruel and evilous
Me slew dem with Leviticus
Make dem heart shook up, pon the evil network dem hook up
Turn over the pot of corruption weh dem have deh a cook up
So listen to mi sisters, open up your ears mi brother
Let your Bible be your passport and your pilot, mi Jah Jah
So if the evil have a...plan
Tell dem say, God a guide you
If dem waan to chat strong inna your ears, tell dem no bother
'Cause

[Chorus]
Jah Jah keep bless we more
I'm surrounded by hypocrites
Plead our cause when we pray, Lord
Wicked must fade away
Dem badmind and think we nuh know
It's written all over dem face
So, plead our cause when we pray, Lord
Wicked must fade away

[Verse 3]
Hey!
A so we stay
Read a chapter a day
That's why the blow weh dem a chuck unuh come our way
Dem worser than a tooth decay
No make dem make you rise no 'K
Just overcome dem from you know a God a lead the way
Him alone unuh fi worship, give your praises to no other
Crab inna barrel, no make dem climb upon you like no ladder
Leave all vengeance to Him, all when dem a tell you 'bout your mother
Stay cool, calm, and collected, 'cause a that Him woulda rather

[Chorus]
Jah Jah keep bless we more
I'm surrounded by hypocrites
Plead our cause when we pray, Lord
Wicked must fade away
Dem badmind and think we nuh know
It's written all over dem face
So, plead our cause when we pray, Lord
Wicked must fade away

[Verse 1]
As I lift my eyes to the hills
From where my help is coming down
Haters a put a fight
Me know dem woulda waan fi see you drown
So, you fi put your trust in the King
No time you nuh fi have no doubt
You badmind, better you lay low
And ask God fi save you now
Make me see your hands raising...
Inna the air and praise Him
From you know you're not faking
Open your mouth and shout it out

[Chorus]
Jah Jah keep bless we more
I'm surrounded by hypocrites
Plead our cause when we pray, Lord
Wicked must fade away
Dem badmind and think we nuh know
It's written all over dem face
So, plead our cause when we pray, Lord
Wicked must fade away
