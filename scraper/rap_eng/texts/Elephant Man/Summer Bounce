Brand new dance weh John Hype them a buss
Surf and balance when the wave rise up

Padlock it and forget it just like a handcuff
Give them a lot of dance, them can't get enough
Make way little fool and give the dancing tough

Do Summer Bounce, do Summer Bounce
Do Summer Bounce a weddi, weddi, weddi, weddi, weddi

Love how the girls look inna them stand and drop
Make me do the Weddi Weddi dance and stop

Turn back way, then you whine and stop
Get Jiggy with it then you whine and stop

Do Summer Bounce, do Summer Bounce
Do Summer Bounce a weddi, weddi, weddi, weddi, weddi

How some gal dress, that make laughing spoil
Send them back to basic, the dress code file

Say she want me plant it down inna the soil
Body look shine like she bathe inna oil

Do Summer Bounce, do Summer Bounce

Do summer bounce. Do summer bounce everybody we have fun
