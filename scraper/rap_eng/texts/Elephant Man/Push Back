Oooh [x7]

[Hook]
Girl I got you so high, and I know you like
So come and push it on me, if it feels alright
When you drop it low, and break me off
No, she doesn't mind (aight)
She doesn't mind (aight)
She doesn't mind

Girl I got you so...

[Verse 1]
Push it back 'pon it, bring it back 'pon it
Gimme di ting becah mi waah fi lock 'pon it
Wine it, wiggle it, set di track 'pon it
Two more shot, now we inna hot 'pon it
Two girl, and dem ready fi jump 'pon it
Two to my world, and mi ready fi tump 'pon it
Ready fi run 'pon it, ready fi dump 'pon it
Tag teaming fiyah truck mi pump on it

Hands up high, we burning up the sky
We got the dance floor crazy, we got the club on fire
I like the way you dance, you got me in a trance
My baby she don't mind at all...

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Wine yuh fi wine it, girl
Same time ah time she ah time it, girl
Same time I line mi align mi top
Fi pose sign it, prime mi ah prime it, girl
Dis ah nuh crime weh mi climb it, girl
Set di temperature, di climate it, girl
Check di rhyme, when mi ah rhyme it
She combine it, dis approve a private world

Hands up high, we burning up the sky
We got the dance all crazy, got the club on fire
I like the way you dance, you got me in a trance
My baby she don't mind at all...

[Hook x2]

[Bridge]
Ain't gonna be shy about it
Ain't telling no lie
Girl I'm a animal, animal
Animal, animal...
I'm breaking it down for the night and
I want you to come for the ride
Let's win it out, win it out
Win it out, win it out...

Oooh [x3]

She don't mind girl!

Oooh [x4]

Come on!

[Hook]
