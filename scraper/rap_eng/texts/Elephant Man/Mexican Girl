Ay hombre senorita (senorita) tenorita
Ladies, I am here to tell a story
About a lady I met in Mexico
This is my story
Crossing the border
You wish to listen (to listen, to listen) of El Paso (turn up your volume) eating a taco (shizzle)
Me and my girlfriend listen (listen, listen)

(Verse 1)
She say I'm a vato
Gangsta live is my motto
From the day that I spot you
I know that I got you
Playing my banjo
Me and my hombre named Bancho
I would like to get some of your el de gro gato

Who is that stranger coming in from Santiago?
Leaving his mark on the girl's underwear like Zorro
She's my Mexican girl (ah-ha, ah-ha) for the ladies senorita (ah-ha)
She's my Mexican girl (ah-ha, ah-ha) A hombre (ah-ha) listen its not finished

(Verse 2)
She say I'm a playa
She don't want no straya
My sweet senorita
My Tia Maria
I not a heart-breaker
I am a love maker
I'm not from Mexico
I am from Jamaica

Who is that stranger coming in from Santiago?
Leaving his mark on the girl's underwear like Zorro
She is my Mexican girl (ah-ha) shizzle (ah-ha) dedicate this for all the ladies all over (ah-ha)
She's my Mexican girl (ah-ha) ladies (ah-ha) shizzle shizzle (ah-ha)

(Verse 3)
Every night by my bedside
I pray for the Westside
Including the desert
Although it's the dead side
This Mexican woman
Deserves a good man
To give her affection
And nuff satisfaction
Who is that stranger coming in from Santiago?
Leaving his mark on the girl's underwear like Zorro
She's my Mexican girl (ah-ha) ladies (ah-ha) all over shizzle (ah-ha)
She's my Mexican girl (ah-ha) (ah-ha) shizzle A hombre (ah-ha)

Dedicate this for the ladies
Mexico, the Westside
Eastside, New York
London
How could I forget about Jamaica?
