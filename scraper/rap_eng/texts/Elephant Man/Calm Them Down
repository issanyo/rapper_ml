[Hook]
We nah stop dance and burn out badmind all the way
So, no bother listen the remarks them pass and what them say
Calm them down
New dance, a go mad them
Calm them down
New dance you fi know
Move up your shoulder, stretch out your two hand them
Calm them down
Calm them doooooown

[Chorus]
Come a, come a, come a, come make we calm them down
We calm them down
We calm them dooooooown
M.O.B., Ravers, Blazé, a di dancing team
KD and di Cayman team
Sweat a run like streeeeeeeeam

[Verse 1]
Alright!
Them waan see the dance, people a come from north and come from south
A di dance dem haffi catch, it dem a talk about
It easy fi do, lean back, move your shoulder in and out
Crazy Hype dem and Sri Lanka have it a run the route
Certain dancer, me hear dem a talk dem mouth, we nah go answer
Alright, since them want it, M.O.B. have the answer
Sri Lanka, run over player hater like a tanker
Sadiki, come cash in the money machine like a banker

[Hook]
We nah stop dance and burn out badmind all the way

Get force ripe overnight, man a go disarm them
Lyrics a go deform them, somebody warn them

New style a run the place, a buss the place, so go inform them
Acting like a storm, but how him fi blow?, so man a go calm them
Gangsta's a surf, pon di turf, bere hot gyal a swarm them
Since dem a di sea, we a di tide, watch it, make we calm them
Dancers run di place, go tell some fool, ring the alarm them
Dem style yah nah go dead, you nuh haffi ban them
