Yep, Davjoa Voo bun dem out

Fadda God say fi me fi bun down Saddam and Gomara so

Chorus:
Certain things wah gwan a foreign, can't gwan a Jamaica
Nah support no chi chi and we nah support no raper
Nah support no bwoy, wah bruk we foot and tek we paper
Dat can't gwan a Jamaica, that can't gwan a Jamaica
Certain things wah gwan a foreign, can't gwan a Jamaica
Man a worship Allah, like dem forget di Creator
How you fi diss we up and you nuh greet di undertaker
Dat can't gwan a Jamaica, that can't gwan a Jamaica

Verse 1:
(Wah you say) No fuck with no Jamaican, dem will change up like di weather
You and Saddam a plot together, then we shot off one a yuh feather
Cut your throat if we find out you and Bin Laden a bredda
Black you out like di light wey go way inna New York wah day ya
Wuk and send down di money, we don't intend fi stay ya
One a wayer we wha fi drive some big car just like di Mayor
Gal a sayer, Ele dey ya this a fi dem holidayer
Man a player without no delay ya couldn't be no gay ya
Ask Faya, di anaconda mek she a say she prayer
Then she laye when me pop it out cau man a nuh pussy slayer
No betraya, nah switch from di gal dem all when we old and graya
Pussy haffi kill me, a dat me say ya

Chorus:
Certain things wah gwan a foreign, can't gwan a Jamaica
Nah support no chi chi and we nah support no raper
Nah support no bwoy, wah bruk we foot and tek we paper
Dat can't gwan a Jamaica, dat can't gwan a Jamaica
Certain things wah gwan a foreign, can't gwan a Jamaica
Man a worship Allah, like dem forget di Creator
How you fi diss we up and you nuh greet di undertaker
Dat can't gwan a Jamaica, dat can't gwan a Jamaica

Verse 2:

Big up every yardman inna Rockers Island

Big up every dance crew, we nuh care you a who
Tek di videolight, cause your clothes new (oonu dance)
Jamaican island way we love, di land of food and water
Nah go run way from down ya cause nothing we nuh shorter
We have we own a cement company and coffee maker
If you hungry, go down a Treesland go visit up di baker
Big up di rasta man dem up inna di hills wah w beat di shaker
Way a reap di high grade dem by di pound and by di acre
Salute to all di farmer, wah a plant up di potato
Love me island me nah go be no forsaker, hey
