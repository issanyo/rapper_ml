[Intro]
Yeah, (true)
I dedicate this one to all my dogs and all my thugs (shizzle!) across the globe (all over)
My big bulla, my jackass corn
I can't believe my black brother dead and gone
You miss a friend, turn your lighter in the air like this
This one is the bad man anthem for life
Shizzle ma nizzle
Put your lighter in the air (put dem inna di air)

[Hook]
Bad man a bad man
And we nuh Rodman
Noooo
Bad man nuh freak man
Gunshot a beat man
Bad man nuh support gay
Same way Jamaicans stay
Yeahhh
Bad man nuh play-play
Pass me di AK
Anytime you buck up inna real bad man
Just hold your space, and give di toppa toppa some way

[Chorus]
My gun tall up to the sky
So, go suck your momma dry
Sure you can take it?
Yeah
Jungle, give him a face lift
Hmm
My gun put you in a hole
Rest my Glock against your mole
Sure you can take it?
Yeah
Gardens, give him a face lift
Bad man time!
Come!

Coming from Montego Bay
I stop in Gully, Flankers, Salem
I reach down to Ochi Rios
But first I pass right in Trelawny
Shizzle ma nizzle
Then I reach down to Ochi, come through Flatbridge
I stop in Spanish Town
I hail up to all my gangsta friends
Yeah
Then I reach over Village
Hail up Penny Irie and the whole family
Came down, I see Jungle

Riverton city, Duhaney Park, Callaloo Bed, Seaview Gardens
Back to Cockburn Pen and Delrock
