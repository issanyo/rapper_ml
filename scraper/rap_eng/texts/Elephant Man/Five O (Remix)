[Verse 1: Swizz Beatz]
Once you hear the police hatin (Hatin) Cause we makin money

Chillin in my Beemer, listenin to Ether
Smokin my reefa, can't find it either

Money in the bank, Swizz can't get it either
(Pull Over The Car!!!) Hands Up!

[Verse 2: Elephant Man]
Alright! Siren a flash I'm caught with di Glock from run inna real roadblock (Yeah!)
Nah get panic with the D.E.A. F.B.I. or di S.W.A.T
All yuh do play cool and don't act a fool mek sure yuh brain intact
Turn to yuh girl, inna di passenger seat, give har yuh strap fi lock
Tek mi outta di car, tell mi nuh move and have dem gun pon cock
Wonda if it's a racial ting like Rodney King because I'm black
Search di car, only ting dem find is just my CD stash
We good to go, like a don, and go hear some album tracks

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean] (Elephant Man) (*Assassin)
Search search search but they can't find nothin (Nothin)
Look look look but they can't find nothin
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!!! Five O!!!!!!!!

Oh oh oh oh oh oh!!! Five O!!!!!!!!
(*Versatile!!!! Check check, Assassin di best, a murda!!!)

[Verse 3: Assassin]
Well mi seh born as a juggler hustler but believe mi
Snitches a sell mi out like they wanna see mi
On COPS, America's Most Wanted or Court TV
Feds dem a hunt fah mi wid info from dem source
But everytime dem reach we disappear just like a ghost
It's not like mi a brag or mi a boast
But mi have my own a source, see di report, dem always keep mi posted

[Verse 4: Yung Joc]
I see the, five O watchin (Watchin) They got they eyes on me (Eyes On Me)
They wanna set me up, land a couple pies on me (Pies On Me)
I'm streetwise I don't ride with them pies on me
The feds takin pictures and they tellin lies on me
Oh see I'm way too clever (Clever) They'll never jam Joc
You with all of them snitchesm get you and your fam shot
I keep my eyes on my rear view, gotta get a clear view
Watch what you do when the five O near you

[Bridge:  Wyclef Jean] (Elephant Man)
Once you hear that WOO! WOO! WOO! (Come on!!!) put the stash away!
When you hear that WOO! WOO! WOO! (Weh yuh seh!!!) A.K. away (A lie!)
Yo! You got your thing on ya? (I got my ting on mi)
You got your thing on ya? (Of course mi have mi ting)
Once you hear that WOO! WOO! WOO! (Weh yuh seh!!!) put the stash away!

[Verse 5: Elephant Man]
Once you hear the (WOO! WOO!) Babylon cover di base
Dem a look fah machine and slugs, bloody on gloves
But mi nuh O.J. caan frame mi cause nobody caan touch mi
But we nah go sign nuh deal real yardie nah go squeal
Tell D.A. seh fi bun appeal, eh?
Dem come a search  search, bout dem a look fah somethin fi tek
Roll up wid dem army waan fi arm we but a Jah protect di I
When dem out fi crucify which is very unlikely
Then they find somethin a fi fry mi

[Chorus: Wyclef Jean] (Elephant Man)
Search search search but they can't find nothin (Nothin)
Look look look but they can't find nothin
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!!! Five O!!!!!!!!

[Elephant Man]:

My lawyer got me off now I'm sittin in somethin
Oh oh oh oh oh oh!!! Five O!!!!!!!!
