Hey, boy, who's that in the alley with a knife in her hand?
I think it's that girl from the autograph stand
She looks kind of sad, does she understand?

That we're only doing our job
Tryin' to make her happy
When we play these songs
But now the show is over

She's comin' over
Knife above her shoulder
I told you, I told you, I told you, I told you

[Chorus]
Run for your life
-You'll wish you had when she
Cuts you with a knife
-And leaves you
Lying on the sidewalk
-With your
Heart in your hands

Run for your life
-You'll wish you had when she
Cuts you with a knife
-And leaves you
Lying on the sidewalk
-With your
Heart in your hands

If you see a girl with a knife
Ridin' on your bus
With my name written on her face
Don't make a fuss, don't rush
Take time, this girl's dangerous

To guys like me
Who are on TV
Jamaican celebrities can hardly believe
That you're gonna act weird when you see 'em on the street
If you've seen what I've seen
Than you're better to believe, to believe me

[Chorus]
Run for your life
-You'll wish you had when she
Cuts you with a knife
-And leaves you
Lying on the sidewalk
-With your
Heart in your hands

Run for your life
-You'll wish you had when she
Cuts you with a knife

-And leaves you
Lying on the sidewalk
-With your
Heart in your hands

I like to drive by
Where you live at
I never stop though
'cause your wife is always home
And I know if she were to look into my eyes
She'd see that we are in love
Yes, we are in love

I'm so glad that we're together now
-Can someone call security?
Did you get that package I sent you?

Run for your life
-Better run for your life
Cuts you with a knife
-Or she'll cut you with a knife
Lying on the sidewalk
-You'll be lyin' on the sidewalk
Heart in your hands
-Hands, yeah

Run for your life
-You better run for your life, boy
Cuts you with a knife
-Or she'll cut you with a knife
Lying on the sidewalk
-Leave you lyin' on the sidewalk
Heart in your hands
-Hands, yeah

[Chorus] x2
Run for your life
-You'll wish you had when she
Cuts you with a knife
-And leaves you
Lying on the sidewalk
-With your
Heart in your hands

Run for your life
-You'll wish you had when she
Cuts you with a knife
-And leaves you
Lying on the sidewalk
-With your
Heart in your hands
