[Chorus:]
When you talk 'bout Bogle, every night is a new style
Young Ravers them find it
Everbody a do the crocodile!
Ding Dong, da one ya bring back memories
So make we bring back the dancehall
Make we show them how it used to be

Come catch the dance, run come catch the style
(New style!)
Just watch Ding when him a freestyle
(Fi him style!)

Croco-crocodile, crocodile
Colo Colo, make up your face like a reptile

Little baby become a land child
(Which style?)
