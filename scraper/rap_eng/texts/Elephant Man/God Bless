[Chorus]
Yea though I walk through the Valley of Death
Nuh haffi worry, we nuh haffi fret
When the heathen a draw you out, your faith dem waan test
You nuh haffi worry 'cause you're God bless
Then we read Psalms 23
It says, "Goodness and mercy shall follow me"
Nah go make dem make we live inna stress
You nuh haffi worry 'cause you're God bless

[Verse 1]
All who a dig hole fi we go down to zero
Tell dem go dig one fi that man inna the mirror
Jah plead we case, anuh Cochran or Shapiro
Burn out the heathens with we Bible like Nero
Dem carry news to Leftside 'bout Dr. Evil
Why people badmind so? I don't know
Jah by we side, you never see we go down
Find out dem heart no clean, leave dem alone
Waan pop you down true dem see you a reach far
No waan see you strive nor reach fi your goal
We nah stop, badmind better move up
We already know how fi dem ting go

[Chorus]
Yea though I walk through the Valley of Death
Nuh haffi worry, we nuh haffi fret
When the heathen a draw you out, your faith dem waan test
You nuh haffi worry 'cause you're God bless
Then we read Psalms 23
It says, "Goodness and mercy shall follow me"
Nah go make dem make we live inna stress
You nuh haffi worry 'cause you're God bless

[Verse 2]
Revelation reveals those badmind people
Who see we do good and a reward we evil
Even 40 camel coulda go through the eye of a needle
Then fi see we wish go true fi we go crash inna vehicle
For all those who never believed in me
Say dem a mi friend and deceiving me
The only time dem see the need in me...
Is when dem need something off of the feeding tree
Well!
We pray fi all of who weh say dem no like us
Nah go see Jah face if unuh no righteous
Read from Timothy go down to Titus
Inna Father God weh me put my trust

[Chorus]
Yea though I walk through the Valley of Death
Nuh haffi worry, we nuh haffi fret
When the heathen a draw you out, your faith dem waan test
You nuh haffi worry 'cause you're God bless
Then we read Psalms 23
It says, "Goodness and mercy shall follow me"
Nah go make dem make we live inna stress
You nuh haffi worry 'cause you're God bless

[Verse 1]
All who a dig hole fi we go down to zero
Tell dem go dig one fi that man inna the mirror
Jah plead we case, anuh Cochran or Shapiro
Burn out the heathens with we Bible like Nero
Dem carry news to Leftside 'bout Dr. Evil
Why people badmind so? I don't know
Jah by we side, you never see we go down
Find out dem heart no clean, leave dem alone
Waan pop you down true dem see you a reach far
No waan see you strive nor reach fi your goal
We nah stop, badmind better move up
We already know how fi dem ting go

[Chorus]
Yea though I walk through the Valley of Death
Nuh haffi worry, we nuh haffi fret
When the heathen a draw you out, your faith dem waan test
You nuh haffi worry 'cause you're God bless
Then we read Psalms 23

Nah go make dem make we live inna stress
You nuh haffi worry 'cause you're God bless
