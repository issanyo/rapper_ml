Then I'm a, ram it in and don't you be panickin
Whose dick on your clit stiff as a manequin
Bawl you up, fold you up, cut the pillow under your gut
Fuck, cause when we fuck best believe were gonna get stuck
So, take that sugar uh, and that sugar
Don't be scared I make that ass alot bigger
Made you shiver, quiver
Tell your friends put there order in I deliver Ghost that nigga
He hit things that make you come quicker
Like, hit it from the back and feel the long thicker
White chicks or sisters, latin Manhattan
Bitches I stop tappin raggin those ridiculous
Can't resist this nasty black licorice

[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah & Elephant Man]
Yo, yo, yo this is Tony and Ele and we smash them hoes
Keep a half a pound a ganja in the bid all rolls
Lampin, in the far places light we light can't be right
And chant murder and keep the walls damp
From Jamaica to Staten Island, y'all put your hands in the air
When y'all hear this shit y'all start whylin
Pop one for Kingston (Blaow!)
In every hood that be holdin it down in the struggle
Tony starts sluggin
