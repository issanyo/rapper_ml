Badmind and grudgeful, pon that me put a hex

Wha' you a go do, the truth come into your test
Nothing cyan save you, not even bulletproof vest
(Talk your mind now!) And release the stress

Fi envy people, a dem greatest interest
Sit down and chat, nah stop we progress
Still a fly Jet Blue, still a shop a Go West
The Bible never lie, the truth a manifest
Me nuh waan see the rest of them, not a dentist
Nah make them dutty life mash up my happiness
Nuh worry 'bout them 'cause nuff of dem a pest
How them so mix up? Like falcon chest

Push up your hand because you're God blessed
Alright!
