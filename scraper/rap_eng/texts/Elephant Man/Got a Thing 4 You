[Verse 1: Da Brat]
My dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me
But I know you very well
So let me tell about Da Brat-ta-ta-ta-ta
I'm light skin, redbone, peanut butter complxion
Very affectionate, very direct
When I'm expressing myself
I'm 5'5", my astrology sign is Aries
Thick in my thighs, 36Bs
Pretty brown eyes, no hair weaves
Put it down with these lucious suckable lips
Making you wanna reach out and touch'em
Come on and give me a kiss
Could it be those hips just pokin' out of my jeans?
I showed them once or twice
And some niggas have become feems
I'm a javouci rocking, hat cockin, blunt smoking
No stopping, weave cocking
With constant heat dropping
Bombs on nonbelievers charming
All the people, they call it the life of leisure
I'm preaching what I'm speaking
This you ain't used to seeing
So please, believe it, you needin the B to the R muthafucking AT

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go

[Verse 2: Da Brat]
I'm steppin in the club now ya'll, hey now
Niggas showing me love ya'll, hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggas, they got the ooh
I'd be sitting in my car waiting on you to drop off my package
A big zipped locked baggy to support my habit
We'll go together like Roger and Jessica Rabbit
I'm spoiled rotten, I'm rocking pink silk panties at the moment
But I'm sport cotton but jeanie's dreamin' of
Jeanie will blink me to scottie
So he can beam me pump adrenaline into my blook steam
Proceed extremely with caution
I'm probably gleaming
Because my bling bling is worth a fortune
It seems things will never change
So I puffed often cause these days niggas is crazy
You can't pay me to roll without my AK

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go
(Check it out)

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
I can't let go of this game
I can't let go of this fame
But for sure, before I go
You niggas gonna know my name
'Cause I'm so doogie, one in a million
Cop a brazzillion for the coochie that rides smoothly
Pass the doogie, the dutchie
Rudely interrupted, your regularly scheduled program
I throw down and bust it
There ain't no hoe around touching me
I'm sharper than cutlerly
I slice niggas to itty bitty pieces
I'm steppin in the club now ya'll, hey now
Niggas showing me love ya'll, hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggas, they got the ooh

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
And I can't let go, I smoke
So, so def
Here we go again for the 2003
B to the RAT
