[Verse 1: Elephant Man (Harry Toddler)]
Badman biggest enemy, that a police
Police biggest enemy a rudebwoy click
Badman rot, dem cyan get dem sleep
Police a patrol several days of the week
If you think a lie, go ask Matthew's Lane click
President down a Garden a monitor the peace
A youth just dead! We nuh know a who dweet
That dem waan see fi go skin dem teeth
All ol' dog, haffi lef' off of the street
The whole place nice, badman deh pon leaf

[Chorus]
Too much!
War, war, war

[Verse 2: Elephant Man (Harry Toddler)]
Some rudebwoy love go party and club
Some rudebwoy love old time rub-a-dub
While some of dem a ol' inna Mel, Jimmy mug
Some of dem love pose with dem little slug
While some of dem love go a rub go beg dub
Certain police we a go pull dem plug
Nuff of dem mouth, a run a real born thug
Take set inna you skin like parasite bug
Beat up people like old dutty rug
All when you a deal with peace and love
We nuh land to no slaughter, we humble like dove
Dem a gwan like the conquering lion up above
A pure!

[Chorus]
Too much!
War, war, war
Too much!
War, war, war
Too much!
War, war, war
Too much!
War, war, war

[Verse 3: Elephant Man (Harry Toddler)]
Society's biggest problem, that a the gun
A long time me tell dem say, the war thing fi done
A long time some gyal dem stop give the man bun
A long time the mama man thing, that fi done!
A long time some gyal fi stop hold baby down
A long time some boy fi stop draw man
What a long time the school dem fi get more veggie bun
Teacher fi stop beat pickney fi fun
A long time the ratta-tat-tat thing, that fi done
Full time badman stop break the law down
Time fi happiness and joy and fun
Hand inna di air! If you want it fi come
Fire me a burn fi wicked man thing done
Beat down injustice dem with mi drum
Haffi talk the truth because me know say me nuh dumb
Haffi talk the truth 'cause me nuh under no rum

[Chorus]
Too much!
War, war, war
Too much!
War, war, war
Too much!
War, war, war
Too much!
War, war, war
