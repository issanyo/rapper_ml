[Bridge]
Alright!
Ova Di wall, Ova Di Wall
Put your AK Ova Di Wall
Ova Di wall, Ova Di Wall
Dem diss man from Red Hills and White Hall
Ova Di wall, Ova Di Wall
Blood ago run like Dunns River Falls
Ova Di wall, Ova Di Wall
Like stretch limo, a so we gun tall
Hey!

[Chorus]
Badman no romp with informer none at all
Badman put your AK Ova Di Wall!
Wrong man name fassyhole dem go call
Badman put your AK Ova Di Wall!
No boy coulda never diss mi mother, none at all
Badman put your AK Ova Di Wall!
Take we simple and think we gun small
Badman put your AK Ova Di Wall!

[Verse 1]
If dem make we pop out we gun pon them
All five magazines we woulda done pon dem
Man a real badman like Joel and dem
Can't diss Tivoli nor Pen man dem
True unuh go diss a little man, and him run from dem...
Dem a fool, dem a idiot, anuh gunman dem
If a me, me woulda drop a bomb pon dem
Kidnap dem daughter and dem son from dem
Give dem 'K bullet, the Magnum 1 dem
To all badman, this a the gun anthem
'Cause we come fi set a better gunman trend
So big up all the shottas and we gunman friends

[Chorus]
Badman no romp with informer none at all
Badman put your AK Ova Di Wall!

[Verse 2]
From wah day, some boy a get bright and feisty
Tell dem say, no make we take the 'K off of safety
Boom down village, and town, and bere city
Boom up sodomite, battyman, and gay city
Only the sucking pon the breast, me maple it
Tell dem hold the peace, and make things stay pretty
Hollow point chop off informer face, you see
That a Black Rhino me use and paste, you see
Done an informer boy, make him gyal trace, you see
Full him up of shot from him head to him waist, you see
Tomorrow morning, nuff of dem better pray fi see
Ready fi done the boy dem in a haste, you see
Scoobay!

[Chorus]
Badman no romp with informer none at all
Badman put your AK Ova Di Wall!

No boy coulda never diss mi mother, none at all
Badman put your AK Ova Di Wall!
Take we simple and think we gun small
Badman put your AK Ova Di Wall!
