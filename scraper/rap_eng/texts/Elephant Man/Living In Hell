[Intro: Elephant Man]
Mhm hm
Give it to dem yah
Hum!

[Bridge: Elephant Man & Ricky Rudy]
Gyal!
You no walking cemetery (no)
Gyal!
You no dash 'way no belly (no)
And you never kill none of your pickney
Weh you fi say?

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Gyal, you never kill no pickney from you born yet
Some gyal a commit innocent death
Time alone, some of dem a sketel, hey bwoy!
Think dem in Heaven, but dem living in Hell

[Verse 1: Ricky Rudy]
Hear me nuh, hear me nuh, hear me nuh
Well, bwoy want dem son yah
Slam can't done yah
Hot inna the summer
Part it like a plumber
Nice and fat gyal, you know she anuh bunner
Say, the youth dem haffi come yah 'cause she nah nyam no son
And me love the gyal dem weh a tic and a whine like a clock
And a from you know you're fit, gyal anuh nothing if you're fat
Dance the punchline 'cause you no idiot
Elephant Man, nasty gyal dem fi attack

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Gyal, you never kill no pickney from you born yet
Some gyal a crucify dem youth!
Time alone, some of dem a sketel
Dem think dem in Heaven, but dem living in Hell

[Verse 2: Elephant Man]
This a simply the truth, some gyal a coot, dem no like bear fruit
Dem lucky say me stop from wear mi kung fu suits
Me no like fi see when the apple and cane a bear from the roots
Me no waan dem pluck, me no waan dem seed fi give me bad juice
No waan dem sour lime, so tell dem keep dem grapefruit
Me no waan dem serve it up come catch inna mi pants loop
Me no waan dem mix me up inna man ginup group
Dem make me talk mi mind...

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Gyal, you never kill no pickney from you born yet
Some gyal a commit innocent death
Time alone, some of dem a sketel, hey bwoy!
Think dem in Heaven, but dem living in Hell

[Verse 3: Ricky Rudy & Elephant Man]
Hear me nuh, hear me nuh, hear me nuh
Dem a modeler pose, and dem a wear duppy clothes
Dem a murder
Some gyal a gwan hype, original hype no right
But dem a murderer!
'Cause dem a modeler pose, and dem a wear duppy clothes
Dem a murder
Nuff gyal a gwan hype, original hype no right
But dem a murderer!
Me waan mi son, me waan mi likkle daughter
A murder! Anuh fi mi youth dem waan slaughter
Gwan flush dem out like dutty pipe water
Bling Dawg! A murder dem deh gyal deh fi charged fah
Gyal, you no filthy
Hand inna the air because you nah live guilty
'Bout Jackie no pregnant and her breast dem so milky
And a pressure the man fi buy nighty weh silky
Hey, girlfriend, you cool!

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Gyal, you never kill no pickney from you born yet
Some gyal a crucify dem youth!
Time alone, some of dem a sketel
Dem think dem in Heaven, but dem living in Hell
