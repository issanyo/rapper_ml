[Intro: Lady Saw (Elephant Man)]
Me tired of backshot and lay down pon it...
Me waan sidung!

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Loving you want, baby a that a dweet (a that a dweet)
Rip up pillow, tear up a lot of sheet (a lot of sheet)
Stay pon it whole night, nah drop asleep
Stamina inna back, we nuh weak

[Verse 1: Elephant Man (Lady Saw)]
You ready fi it?
Gyal
Gya-gya-gyal
Gyal, me love when you a whine and you a sidung pon it
Me know it hot, but you nuh mind when you still a sidung pon it
If it easy, shift your spine, you still a sidung pon it
She a tell me take time and still a sidung pon it

Me tired of backshot, me waan fi sidung pon it
A pon the edge me waan fi kotch when me a sidung pon it
It coulda slim, it coulda fat me know fi sidung pon it
Can do this, me can do that when me a sidung pon it

Gyal, me love how you a wuk it when you sidung pon it

You haffi give me a medal when me a sidung pon it
Know you like it when me pedal and sidung pon it

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Mi say, loving you want, baby a that a dweet (a that a dweet)
Rip up pillow, tear up a lot of sheet (a lot of sheet)
Stay pon it whole night, nah drop asleep

Loving you want, baby a that a dweet (a that a dweet)
Rip up pillow, tear up a lot of sheet (a lot of sheet)
Stay pon it whole night, nah drop asleep

[Verse 2: Lady Saw (Elephant Man)]
E-E-Ele', Ele' don' you love how me a whine and sidung pon it?
Me know it hot, but me nuh mind 'cause me a sidung pon it
Me know how fi whine and take mi time when me a sidung pon it
Gimme the whole 9, make me sidung pon it

Gyal, me love how you attack it when you sidung pon it
How you grip it and lock it when you sidung pon it
The way you lift it and drop it when you sidung pon it
That make me haffi slap it when she sidung pon it
She say...

Me nuh love the belly-to-belly whine
Me prefer fi back it up and feel it up inna mi groin
Early morning when a the wickedest time
When me just leave the club and waan recombine

Yeah!
Backshot was her favorite position
Now she upgrade, ready fi the next mission
Say, she want a chair, me give her something fi sit on
Her man lose him seat, just like a politician
Yeah!

[Chorus: Elephant Man]
Loving you want, baby a that a dweet
Rip up pillow, tear up a lot of sheet
Stay pon it whole night, nah drop asleep
Stamina inna back, we nuh weak (we nuh weak)
Loving you want, baby a that a dweet
Rip up pillow, tear up a lot of sheet
Stay pon it whole night, nah drop asleep
Stamina inna back, we nuh weak
