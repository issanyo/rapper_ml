[Intro: Elephant Man]
Elephant Man came, let it rain
Turn up!

[Hook: Elephant Man]
Every ghetto yout fi rich, we [?] light the puffer
Me and Kane, we make it rain, burn enough to float the water
[?], she no shotta
Every ghetto yout fi rich, fi rich, fi rich

[Verse 1: Kano]
Yo, I'm oh so illy
Miracle type like an old-school Dizzee
All about the pen, choose old-school Diddy
Old-school crep with my new-school Lizzy
Big riddim on the road
Cash in my pocket like Willy with the dough
See me in the Porsche, see Ellie in a [?]
Next thing your niggas might see me on a boat
A gyal in bikini, bottle of [?]
Rub that down till I make that (COLD!)
Gyal tell me wicked like General Levy
Rack it up, rack it up, rack it up (COR!)
Like showing off, yep lady (SO!)
Big arse Viviennes, big arse (ARSE!)
Gyal dem in love, caught loads of money
Loads and loads and loads of money
Fuck advance, got bags already
[?], make pounds from pennies
Small talk raves like Bradford Nelly
Eyes on me, no Machiavelli
Glastonbury but don't wear wellies
19-inch but don't drive Chevys
Keep it roared like Lambourne's Eddy
So hold tight old-school man like Reggie
Reggie, reggie, steady? (GO!)
One for the Marilyns, two for the pros
Inflation, inflation, but I
Keep making, keep making (DOUGH!)
Shout to them, shout to them, [?]
Right up the dance, get dumb to the beat
Wankers, [?], whores and chauffeurs
Playing with money like Monopoly

[Link]
Dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar
Dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, pound sterling
Dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, dollar, pound
Dollar, dollar [?]

[Verse 2: Kano]
Yo, straight money man
Take that paper straight to the bank
Still got some of that rubber band money
So [?] got me straight while I land
