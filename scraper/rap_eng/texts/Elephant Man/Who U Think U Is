Chorus:
Who u think u is just tru yuh get a gon fi borrow
When u take his piece ya friend a timmy friend a sorrow
Nobody no wif dem a go live fi see tomorrow
Cau, life is like da likkle road da way so narrow
Who u think u is just tru yuh get a gon fi bar

Everyday yuh get up you a preach beer war
No dem find them pon a cart dem problem are

Verse 1:
Full yuh take up badness mek up your mind same time
Cau Babylon no hitch when dem a blow carbine
Dem show to yar har dem, nah show fi yuh spine
No a beer there dead son dem a dat a find
Yah miss yar friend yuh miss yar son, check man purse
So tie me up fi wonder if it is a curse
How me a dead a year sey dem put people first
But di younger thing do fi put everybody in a hearse
Last night In bingo sey inna how much a worth
An den mi grammy sey she get a vision bout dirt
Inna di vision she sey sumthin bout church
God over devil an island come first

Chorus:
So Who u think u is just tru yuh get a gon fi borrow

Verse 2:
Sey dem a bad man don't know bout bein a revolutionary

Yuh wan fi a de fear yuh prompt de call on teary
But this with dem shine dem gangsta are no ordinary
People hear me find when me practice on the virginary

Got too cool a ton dem badness, uncle sam dem fear we
Dey put inna dem all de you no bomb no a dem no scare me
Stow dem a life a from di matrix, dat thing no come near me
Im a universe a futuristic cheer den what about Jeremy

Chorus:

Walker tell de youth dem both, sey u a star
Everyday yuh get up you a preach beer war
No dem find them pon a cart dem problem are
