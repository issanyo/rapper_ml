[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo, yo, I'm like Montana in Scarface while credits is running
Foes stretched out on a pool of blood, trust me I'm gunning
Most underrated, highly influenced, I'm rap's truest
More then an artist, my style embodies a whole movement
Me and mic form an intimate relationship, Monogamist
Knowledge's, I done touched more women then Gynecologist
A lot of this my adolescence stages
Now my mind is focused on billion dollar wages
Haze in the bloodstream, life is like a dream
Moving at the speed of light in my mind but going nowhere
From the East but still need a pass before you go there
Challenge me? Don't get yourself massacred
I'm just a G from a dark continent in Africa
You can find my rhymes on the livest walls up in Attica
When I was young fell in love with Hip-Hop so I married her
She got abused by some bird niggas so I carried her
Hood Messiah till I expire black cotton attire
Live wire climbing charts like Tobey Maguire

(Chorus) Tragedy
I'm the truest
I'm the truest

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo, yo, yo, it's just a G'd up presentation
Savior to the culture, Black Jesus
My revelation I write is prophetic
My style is the truest, far beyond industry credit
Yet I neva knew this child of the ghetto would grow so rich
To influence so many lives wit the rhymes I spit
School system said I was mentally incompetent
That was nonsense I'm just dealing wit a higher conscious
Foreva G tho my Tek still blow
Exclude the roof off the magnum sipping on merlot
Tell my enemies that they can come get it
But a gun come wit it
Tie my pride uptight so I can run wit it
Having fun wit it like when B.I.G. Pac & Pun did it
If I neva made a dime I'm still being loved wit it
Challenge is the inner demon fighting for my aura
Don't get it twisted a King is far greater then a balla
Mahdi hood Noble Drew Ali, Black Soprano
My swagga is like the Jenever's at the roundtable
Back when niggas pushed jetters wit the spoiler kits on it
Use to pull a jux snatching nigga chain running pointing
Things change like finding out your man's an informant
You don't know I'm ill like the AID virus laying dormant
Trust me this ain't a mockery, my moms died from it
2-5 on my bicep bullet wounds in my stomach
Use to putting hammers to a cowards head tell 'em run it
Now my mind is in the right zone plus I'm quiet grown
The greatest lines escaped from my mind when the mic's on

(Chorus) Tragedy
