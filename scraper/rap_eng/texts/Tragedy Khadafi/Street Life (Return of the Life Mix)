[Verse 1]:
A baby has a baby and she's wondering how
Has to take care of the newborn child
Forget about the father cause he's living foul...
No time for school and you dropped that lesson
I guess you could say, school's out of the question
Heard your mama flipped, she threw you on the street
Now you and your shorty ain't got nothing to eat
No one's around when the chips are down
And your baby's father nowhere to be found
Can't raise a kid, he's doing a bid
Wellfare stopped your check, you flip your lid
And everybody's saying that it's too late
Depending on the state you're on section 8
He ran the game that all men ain't the same
The world's on your shoulder but you gotta maintain
Pick up the baby and give him the last kiss
Hit the bathroom and slit your wrist
Love is life and life is love
Just enough strength to jump in the tub
And as your blood runs down the drain
Another poor soul full of sorrow and pain

[Hook] (x2):
Cause it's the joy and pain
Sunshine and rain
As the world turns, life remains the same
Return of the life (x4)

[Verse 2]:
Black men, you want money and fame
Hustle, hustle, now you in the drug game
Get your money up, get it up, get the ends
Dreaming one day you gonna drive that Benz
Getting cash and you don't stop
Til the hooker turns you on to needle pop
Through the vein, up to the brain
Used to get money now you caught in the game
Mr Big, used to be a threat
Now you don't even weight 40 pounds wet
The HIV gave you AID
You're history, in the cemetery
Rolling strong, had it going on
But now the money and the cars is gone
And you're lost in the game that remains the same
Another lost soul who's gonna feel the pain

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]:
I knew a kid named Peace who grew up on my block
Running through life,trying to be a hardrock
Started doing crime and the kid couldn't stop
Whoever had a little bit of cash he was wreaking
Got a big rep for his robbing and sticking
Pointing a gun at everyone - he was flipping
Thought he was fly and he just couldn't die
'Till one day he robbed a wrong guy
Around the way, on a hot summer day
A car pulled up and the bullets started to spray
Went through the vest, hit him in the chest
Rest in peace, cause peace is at rest
I guess you could say he's caught in the game
Out of control and he's gonna feel the pain

[Hook] (x3)
