[Chorus:]
What you think about me ain't none of my business
As long as you ain't fucking up none of my business
You know i shot niggers minumum sentence
If I loan money i want it back with interest
Elevate (elevate) [x4]

[Verse 1:]
Found my D in flipping the wrist
If you were a pock you can't see
Get high off the yapee
And get sloppy
Emphatically in al desiphor am a good with the wine
You hit this shit one time man this shit was flown in
Hydroponic weed it was water it was grown in
It’s getting me paranoid my mind start zoning
Ok pass me the bamboo I’m blank I’m about to go and get more
Whats up with Trav J
My brain frozen that shit will make Gone or the donkaden the Omen
Plenty bad bitch with me that will be how we rollin
Sometime watching her twist is even better than brain
I said when I’m on the bubble skunk metal
I came a long way from enditement
Jacqueline Hyde you use to get a free zipper bag
Better than five pound be some pot heads
CNN yea we chi chi chong hold up
Fuck a bowl you can keep your bong blow blow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Yea am in the distribution burgatory
Cocaine to sell a story only sold the product though
Always heard it's better for me
What got and got to go a rocking burgatory
Money on the elevator in my pocket showing
Elevation persuasion I land with an asian
Her friend caucasian less than United Nation
Ok mountains of cayucos asians
Rise for the cause my cause more amazing
Never be cubili relations i need locations
I’m good with that vovalvodo
Drop it like domino
Falling like its show debt in fresh press small
Smoke more or less stress we going to legalize it
Am going to head west
Innovative clip sprayers break walls with majors
Imallayers surrounds my neck while ice glacors
Laying on acres every shooters from my hood is famous
The handcuffs can't fit it's too big for the cages

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Knowledge to edge take the pledge off the glory
Paint time visualize now you know the story
Never trust a label neither invoicing the statement
Housing and tenements I’m not the one to play with
Spit the 88th ward that crack i laced it
Like I’m still in Karl’s hall slinging the grey shift
You stoned like medusa
Don't worry about pulling up
A shooter pull up on you on a scooter go

[Chorus]
