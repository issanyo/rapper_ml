The wail of sirens falls upon deaf ears
The bombs fall silent but for all to see
With eyes wide open we watch
In suspended motion we pray
As their bombs fall loudly
Where our silent bodies lay
We hug our children + say
We hug our sisters + say
In plain sight they prey
In plain sight they see the whites
Of the eyes + the grit of our teeth
And yet...they still defeat
Our hearing lost to blasts of tyranny
Our ears deafened from lifeline + defeat
They rely on submission
They depend on our lack of will
They thrive upon our ignorance
And salivate on our grief
