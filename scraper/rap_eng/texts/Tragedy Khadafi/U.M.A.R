[Chorus:]
They only give you flowers when you can't smell them
Well I’m a give you trees when you can not tell them
You did a bit for the team we won't forget that
Caught me any nights we would talk yea chit chat
Oh man you man’s all real
Ke Ke KE ke Keep it real
Oh man you man’s all real
Ke Ke KE ke Keep it real
Oh man you man’s all real
Ke Ke KE ke Keep it real

[Verse 2:]
You see a vision and a better life
The eyes or a dreamer until a poison
Got between us like a pound of venus
Every man is accountable for his own demons
Deep in the shadows of my mind i can hear the screaming

[Verse 3:]
Yeah you love to hear the story again
Too bad you will only shine so glory be towards my name
See you in the future tomorrow's mouse give me a pen
If your heart stop beating i go back in time
Reverse the sin in the hour glass
When you counting my crime
I wanted by my own cerebellum
Love unconditional but i could never tell her
Remember gum fire echo in my mind bending
I find it hard to even talk about it now bredrin
You sacrificed your life and paid the price for a legend
Facts it's really real what I’m saying yea so real I’m saying
Oh Lorenzo i wish i could apologize to make it simple
But life twisted life changing simple
Now facing these lines and everything we been through
Got me pouring my heart out over this instrumentals
Your mom gave me the number so i spoke with them
Always got that unibrow eyebrow i joked with them
Pakistan G i admire you if i get the label right
You know I’m a hire you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Yo i keep waking up thought i was done dreaming
Is it my que that i heard it again later that evening
I know that voice but that’s nobody but uptop
I thought he was in grain sing sing don’t stop
The next morning i caught him by the window walking
A child when i heard a No like i just peaked track
I got love for this nigga so I’m going to live
I pull to the house got to show him my strength
Everyday we reminisce about mommy you know the clip too
Laughing about the day he fell and got a chip tooth
Only nigga i know respected by everybody
And he ain't even have to sell crack to buss a shotty
The ore in the nigga pure flow in your blood
And you got a reputation until you lay in the mud
You trash hoe you can’t take his place
So i had a son too tatoo on your face
He was real and believe strong like everything we breathe on
Them moma heard the voice like the jeans long
When we were in that jail together
Which we would have kept it real for ever
Oh you my brother from another mother
You know nigga i love you for ever time will tell
Trying to seal the letter I’m gone
Your mom gave me the number so i spoke with them
Always got that unibrow eyebrow i joked with them
Pakistan G i admire when i get the label right
You know I’m a hire you

[Chorus]
