[ *shooting sounds from the tv set* ]
Yo
Yo, little man, what you're doin?
We're watchin a western
A western?
Yeah, cowboys
This ain't really no cowboy movie, man
Yo, ain't nobody on here black
Know what I'm sayin?
Peep the real cowboy flicks
What's a real cowboy flick?

A real cowboy?
I'ma show you what a real cowboy is
I'ma show you what a true cowboy is
Phat Katz, bring it

[ VERSE 1 ]
Billy The Kid was a well-known villain
But I know a black villain that did more killin
Dismissed from the western movies and tv
(Cherokee Bill) spillin blood, killin em easy
The final frontier adds another test
For slaves and Indians headed towards the west
Another showdown, so don't put your gun away
You start shootin like your name was Doc Hollyday
So it's safe to say real men wore black
Gunslingers that were quick to put you on your back
Cowboys that were black, we never heard of ya
In order to get respect, you had to be a murderer
In the year of 1895
Cowboys were wanted dead or alive
(The Rufus Buck gang) ripped like a chainsaw
The only law they followed was the law of the outlaw
Cause justice was a cowboy's rifle
You live by the gun, and you're bound to die trifle
Real men shoot it out in a ghost town
The six-shooters gonna spark after sundown

It's The Posse
Shoot em up
Shoot em up

It's The Posse
Shoot em up
Shoot em up

Down with The Posse
Shoot em up
Shoot em up

It's The Posse
Shoot em up
Bang shoot em up

[ VERSE 2: guest rapper ]
Long before John Wayne or Bronson
There was the gun-totin black cowboy named Britton Johnson
He was a legend for runnin things in Texas
He was reckless
However some were brave enough to test his
October 13th (what year?) 1864
Comanche and his boys started a all-out war
So there were bloodstained soils in the west
(Tell em why)
Cause there was no such thing as a bullet-proof vest
So he couldn't escape his date with fate, he was gunned down
By a gang of villains shortly after sun down
25 villains on a Texas plane
25 villains with skills of pain
25 villains livin life on the run
You live by the gun, you die by the gun

(Wild wild west to your chest)
(To your chest)  --]

[ VERSE 3 ]
So now you know the real deal about the wild west
About the land that puts a man to a test
1895 - the year of gold fever
Black cowboys, and now you're a believer
The blackman and redman, together we were riding
Outlaws and rebels and the non-law-abiding
In history the black cowboy was erased
Jesse Lee is gonna show you his face
One out of every three cowboys were black
But if you watch tv, you'll never know that
The blackman had a part in the west too
But if you don't believe us, now we're gonna show you
Another star in the wild west rodeo
(Suprise) was a jet-black negro
The blue-eyed cowboy wasn't the only one
To get respect and fame with the loaded gun
There were renegades quick with the fingers
I give respect to the black gunslingers

It's The Posse
Shoot em up
Shoot em up

It's The Posse
Shoot em up
Shoot em up

Down with The Posse
Shoot em up
Shoot em up

It's The Posse
Shoot em up
Bang shoot em up
