[Tragedy Khadafi]
Long live the Mahdi, 2-5 the Arab Nazi
Hydraulic stash wood grain dash where the Glocks be
Older God is back shutting down microwave rap
Serving the game wit that gourmet, exotic hood tray
Guerilla rap, when I strike is like combat
Aristocrat, Ghetto Diplomat
In fact I ride hard like 300 Spartans flying carpets
Israeli gun, vultures eating on their dead carcass
King Solomon swagga, Purple Heart violent, keep my grass low
Venomous snakes will hold daggers
I'm a champion, title hold and soul controller
Ayatollah when I roll up challenge any team of solo
Hardcore, heart so soft, fly women adore
Slang Cadillac doors when I touch the floor
Roll out the red carpet, Queens is who the FEDS target
