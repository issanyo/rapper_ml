[Intro]
Yeah..
That's that shit right here
If you got some haze... roll that shit up

[Tragedy Khadafi]
To my jailhouse niggas with scars, Allahu Akbar
You learn when you see the keda, Insha Allah
Rest in peace, bagged niggas, hit em up in his car
Lot of serpents get between real niggas with feelins
Fall Back, independent guerillas, we get millions
Take it back, to the arts and crafts, guns and black masks
Cruddy like bloody money, illegal cash
Let me unwrap your turban, you feel like a virgin
Take the V, shopping spree, just go splurgin
Gracious in them pink timbs, your attitude is like I can't win
Mosquitos cover your limbs
I done fell and resurrected, just to perfect it
Armani stripes on my airnights, we on some neck shit
Double R, shotty splash niggas in they mancotti
I rep for Black Gangstas, shit on John Gotti
I spit classics like a 4-Door Mazaradi
The clearest vision, handcuffed, Max-aid prison
Delores Tucker gave me head up in the fed prison
Im feelin like them Black Panthers, niggas still missin
Assada, Cuban refugees in Grenada
Hucci logos on the lamas, lift niggas out they prize
Mahdi's the hood's livest, still in the projects
X5 fly, unidentified objects
Niggas say how you still do it
This gangsta's prolific and he spit that Arabic shit fluent
Was on before Desert Storm, bulletproof gucci
Camouflage Sean John, Lebanon
So, Bless the God, don't Stress the God
Come out them parasucos and finesse my squad
I know it's your first time but it's not that hard
Feer: http://rapgenius.com/Tragedyr, cuz you a star
Put your lips on it, come on, just take *censured*
QB, we call it Kuwait, that old raw shit
Please believe we comin' back with more shit
Please believe we comin' back with more shit
[Right back, right back nigga]

[Outro]
This is hard kid, Littles said like this be the hardest little shit
Yknahimsayin, cuz this shit is real
It's all real, you gotta come from the heart
