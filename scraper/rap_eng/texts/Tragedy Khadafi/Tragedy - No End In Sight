Set your channel for imminent collapse
No reforms can save us from ourselves
A travesty generations old
A tragedy written in stone
Engraved on our tombstones that mark our scars on the earth

Etched in towers threatening to obey the curse
The churning continues
Accelerating so that short of complete and total extinction...

Days of destruction follow days of destruction
Reducing life to such horrid display
That a redefining of words is needed
To explain the wretchedness of the endless tunnel
With no light at the end

Only darkness following darkness swallowing darkness
Days of destruction follow days of destruction
No end in sight
