We comprise the backbone of this leprous body
Of this life(less) from
Ambiguous and vaporous, it moves through us
All Saturating all
With its foul odor of stale blood and sweat
From our tired hands that took out your garbage and swept your floors
Filled your orders and delivered them to your fucking doors
We carry the weight
We suffer the load
