Conditioned inside and out
To the point of no return
To what we may have been
Without all this shit we were born into
Poverty, depression, power and despair

Conditioned inside and out
To the point of no return
By a world not crafted by hands of our own
Yet still we march in step
To the cadence of its irregular beat

The damage has been done
Irreparable and all encompassing
Nature is as archaic word
That could never explain this mess

Worlds become obsolete like ideas
And they won't have to burn the books
When no one reads them anyway
