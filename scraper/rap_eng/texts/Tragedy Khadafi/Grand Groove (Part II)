Yo
This is the jam, you know I'm sayin?
About life and death
About living and dying
About losing people that's real close to you
You know I'm sayin?
Check it out, bust it

C-section, snatched me out by the head
I glanced at the calendar and it read
1971, the 13th of August
Denise gave birth to a dream
A single mother all alone, and it hurts
A bastard child, Pop Duke is in the dirt
Now I'm in the bridge on the block called Vernon
When girls didn't know a damn thing about burning
Rememberin' the days of my youth
Bust my first nut on a project roof
Now I'm on my way to P.S. 111
Miss other tricks living in Ghetto Heaven
That's when I first saw the face of death
And none of the other brothers are left
Like my man Tay-ya from around the way
On the Stagecoach where we used to play
You couldn't tell me then we wouldn't live forever
Welcome back, now we got it all together
Love is life and we live by the day
Peace to the brothers who passed away

To all my brothers who passed away
We love you to this day, you passed away
All my peoples passed away, they passed away
We love you to this day, you passed away
Check it out, bust a move
Grand Groove, bust a move
We love you, Grand Groove, bust a move
Grand Groove, bust a move

I try to maintain with the joy and pain
There's a lot to lose and a lot to gain
From beginning to end, again I intend
When I lost you, I lost my best friend
You gave me a home and a life that was decent
But instead, I ended up in the precinct
A lost soul, I didn't understand
How precious life was until I was a man
I seen a lot of my friends die in the projects
Lost their lives over material objects
But you tried to save me from a young death
So I strive to my last breath
You was the start of my family tree
Gave birth to Junior, and then came me
Grand Groove, Grand Mother
Sister and my brother
Best friend to me, there can never be another
Never, cause I really need you today
Peace to the mothers who passed away

(chorus)
Check it out, bust a move
We love you, Grand Groove, bust a move
Grand Groove, bust a move
We love you, Grand Groove, bust a move
To all my peoples that passed away
We love you to this day, you passed away

I understand you're going back to the essence
But I do miss your presence
Too busy tryna be slick and getting over
Back in the days I used to wish I was older
And I remember
And I remember
And I remember
I used to sneak in the house with my eyes all red, and
Duck the blow that was aimed for my head
Runnin' the streets like a runaway slave
I didn't know you was heading for the grave
Never miss a good friend until they're gone
As long as I'm alive, you're gonna live on and on
Who says your best friend has to be a brother?
A friend is someone who's always there for another
No more snakes in the grass when you're near
Grand Groove, I love you and I wish you were here
I still love you to this very day
One love, Grand Groove, you passed away

(Chorus)

To all my peoples that passed away
We love you to this day, you passed away
All my peoples passed away, they passed away
We love you to this day, you passed away
Check it out, bust a move
We love you, Grand Groove, bust a move
Grand Groove, bust a move
I love you, Grand Groove, bust a move
