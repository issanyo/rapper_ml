[Intro]
Ma this song is for you, cause I love you

[Verse 1]
My tears fall on the paper as I write this scribe
It's like somewhere in my life a part of me died
And through my eyes a forgotten pain, rotten vain
Escapin the hell fire runnin from flames
Seein moms on the kitchen floor
Not knowin that the dope she injected this time was too raw
Saw myself trapped in the womb tryin to get out
Consumed by this hell flamed pain I spit out
On the day we rest may our souls be free
I ain't mad cause this world made a cold like me
I forgive her cause my mother gave us all she could
Just another black girl lost enslaved by the hood
I would trade my existance to give you breath
Guess the only guarantes in this life is death
As I look around seein im the last one left
And the things I can't change I just gotta accept

[Hook: Joya]
I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now whats it gonna be
And I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now can we all be free

[Verse 2]
Watchin the heat throttle on trial cause niggas is tellin
My rap sheet be the novel of a predicate felon
D.A. narrator of a story untold
Homicide found some evidence, the truth unfold
Paintin' pictures for the jury that my heart seem cold
Let me explain this life nearly drove me insane
Cell 33, 'I' block lay in the flat
Eatin Jack Mack, too far can't turn back
Niggas rather see you layin on the coroner's table
Unprepared for the war and even more disabled
Turn they backs on you slay you like Kane did Able
Heard took two in the chest an one in his navel
See my mom chose dope, my pop chose the pipe
So I rhyme like a triple beam balance in life
Hope the scale lean on my side so I can prevail
Most of us lay in the casket or locked in jail
Urban warfare, guerilla combat
I seen a bullet tear a niggas head off upon contact
So pour some Henny out for those not comin back
I pour this Henny out for my nigga Killa Black

[Bridge: B-Minor]
My days and nights are getting longer
We can make it on these corners
I can't take it anymore death is knockin at my door
Will my whole life pass me by
I try to escape when I get high
I dont no if I will survive
Will I live or will I die
I dont wanna wait

[Hook: Joya]
I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now whats it gonna be
And I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now can we all be free

[Verse 3]
The criminal way, a foul price to pay
Another dark day reminisin' on Ty Yey
19 dead plus had baby on the way
Its real shit, chicken heads they dont be feelin shit
Pain runs deep in my life
It just reveals it late night
I'm jumpin out the bed in cold sweat
Drippin' wet playin my gate with cigerette
Up north six months and ain't seen my girl yet
She wrote me once told me she was doin' her thing
Wrote her back told her live her life by all means
Peep game, cause things ain't as real as it seems
Slit her own moms throat for the taste of cream
Had my man dead her, for the cheddar, time will come
But she bounced down south and took my son
If I could reach out and touch her, she'd just get bucked
But I'm locked out stressed out mad as fuck
And I down wanna wait

[Hook: Joya]
I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now whats it gonna be
And I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now can we all be free
I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now whats it gonna be
And I dont wanna wait for our lives to be over
I wanna know right now can we all be free
