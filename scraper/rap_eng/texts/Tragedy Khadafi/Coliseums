INTRO:

(*Dogs barking*)
The business is entertainment and what entertains the customers is the sight of blood

VERSE 1 - TRAGEDY KHADAFI

Peep the god Mahdi
Gem star bars is healthy
I ain’t tryna just be hood rich
I’m tryna get wealthy
I spit that Renoir
Your bars more like a selfie
Ain’t nothing you can tell me
Them dreams you tryna sell me
Faker than nose jobs on the face of Liza Minelli
Come on my nigga really
Guns coming out of Israeli
Moving with murderers from QB to South Philly
I’m what an artist is
Khadaf is miraculous
Hip-Hop’s the Roman Empire
Mahdi is Spartacus
Bars forever lit
Gladiator nemesis
Legendary expert making ya’ll just reminisce
2-5 mic assassin
I spit with killer’s passion
I got the game down
Nigga got it all mastered
That Golden Era struggle
Keeping the truth livin
Whether I’m free in the streets
For all of those biddin
Secure the bag
All my niggas goin hard let’s get it

PRE-CHORUS:

Queens get the money long time no cash
I’m caught up in the hustle where the guns go blast


HOOK:

Ayo I’m caught up in the hustle
Power moves require muscle
Gotta move it, gotta hustle
When the guns go blast
Know the wolves’ll tryna rush you
If you budge or move a muscle
I’m caught up in the hustle where the guns go
On the road to pot of gold
Holes that swallow whole
Dealers and counterfeiters
Children who turn to killers
Prone to squeeze and bust
Slugs’ll go astray
Grind and pray
Tryna survive another day

VERSE 2 - ROCK MECCA

From Jamaica to the Bridge
Surrender and don’t make a sound
The playground for the players who don’t play around
I roll with
The boldest, coldest, soul-less soldiers
The nine holders
The high roller Ayatollah
Genghis Khan don
The only wolf to teach the flock
Goin broke
Tryna beat the odds and beat the clock
Penitentiary chances
Stresses that sprout cancers and ulcers
From tusslin’ with vultures
In sulfur
My life story, allegories of gore and glory
Let champagne rain get your lady to pour it for me
These concrete poems of broken bones & soaken clothes
Composin tomes that baffle popes in Rome
If my casket drops, it’s got to be from the mountaintop
Reach higher heights
Like an astronaut
Like the Warriors movie plot
Fought on each and every block
See you in hell or at the top
I’ll be making both stops

(REPEAT PRE-CHORUS)

(REPEAT HOOK)
