Back to reality

[VERSE 1]
I know you're dreamin, dreamin you could take me out
But just think, cause that's somethin to think about
I'm Trag, so don't think you could take me out
Start thinkin, before you put your foot in your mouth
Cause I'm not the one to be slept upon
My rap is smooth and a step beyond
But it took a little time for the skill to grow
And it took a lotta time for my thoughts to flow
I wanna tell you a story, so sit and wait
Gonna take you to a time when I wasn't so great
When I used to run the street with miss-matched socks
And the summer of 1984 was hot
The jams in the park were really dope
And the girls on the block were playin jump rope
But I couldn't hang out with the guys who hung
Cause my mother always told me I was just too young
But she couldn't understand what it meant to me
That the parties in the park is where I had to be
But way back then I couldn't see -

[VERSE 2]
She would always disapprove, but I didn't care
Cause if a jam was in the park I just had to be there
She would send me to my room, and then lock the door
But it really didn't matter, cause I lived on the first floor
I thought about the girls I couldn't wait to meet
So I jumped out the window, then I hit the street
When the music started pumpin, everybody got up
The Vernon Posse had the dancefloor all sowed up
That's when I thought partyin was all about
Despite a few fights and a few shoot-outs
Everybody kept partyin without a care
You had to have fun, cause it was in the air
From blocks away you could hear them shout
And it got real hype until the power went out
It only lasted for a minute, but ist felt so long
Till the deejay got up and put the power back on
Everybody kept dancin to the record's groove
So I pushed up on a cutie, and we started to move
It felt too good to be true to me -

[VERSE 3]
My eyes were mesmerized by the DJ's cuts
And I knew later on I would have a sore butt
So I sat and thought what the beatin would be like
But I would take seven beatings just to get on the mic
See, unlike other kids, I wasn't athletic
But as I grew, I realized I was poetic
When other kids would wanna play with their friends
I would rather sit day-dreamin about my Benz
With the (diamond in the back) and the (sunroof top)
As I (diggin the scene with a gangster lean)
Yeah, that would be me -
