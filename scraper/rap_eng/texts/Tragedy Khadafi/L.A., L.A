[Hook: Prodigy]
L.A. L.A. big city of dreams
But everything in L.A. ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from outta town
Cos we coming from Queens it gets down

[Verse 1: Noreaga]
Jose Luis Gotcha, golden guns and tons
General, Emanual, Iraq emerald
Government out to get me, trying to stick me
Move quickly, yo the God study swiftly
Indian style, knees bent, hands together
Regulate, drop a cake in like each state
Money to make, first of the month son chop the weight
Break the law and got a score like before
Armageddon, marries street smoke wedding
Invest cheddar in shopping sprees in Reading

[Verse 2: Havoc]
My crew in the front got it locked
My live niggas in the back got the gats
Yo, we true to this black
4-4 likes to pour one to the dome, lubricate your thoughts
Black mask stole a ride to avoid up north
Jeopardize my freedom, blink out when I see him
But nine out of ten niggas wouldn't wanna be him
Rob him for his cash and spend it like per diem
Per diem, per diem, per diem
A-yo this rap shit is ill, kid you make mad dough but still
Hit your crew off so they can sling krills
Show some love kid ain't no selfish shit here
(One love to that nigga Marley Marl)

[Hook: Prodigy]
L.A. L.A. big city of dreams
But everything in L.A. ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from outta town
Cos we coming from Queens it gets down

[Verse 3: Capone]
I'm in too deep, losing sleep I can't call it
In love with this drug shit, loyal and all for it
What's a nigga to do, with no cash, and twenty-two?
Take it, or find out the best way to make it fast
My man's raking cash, fuck being lieutenant
I'm in it to win it so it might just take a minute
To gain grams, put my game plan in action
Ways to make it happen, today's to get the Jackson
Once the weight comes, I'm outta state triple sums
Stop my funds, I got guns to cripple sons
What's the use of heat, with no dough to flee the street
Caught a case with no trace of end, you're dead meat
Legal aid type of route'll have you shipped in greens
Ten thou for a lawyer now who splits your cream
Game is deeper than the sea itself
Agile moves that make fragile crews deflate under pressure
Take it to the next measure with all pleasure
And stack treasure, cheddar, illegal life forever

[Interlude]
(Open Sesame)
(Yeah all together, like a butter soft leather)

[Verse 4: Tragedy Khadafi]
Been on this planet for twenty-five years and still strong
The world's rotten like the veins in my father's arm
I remain calm, study Islam, read the Torah
World going in flames like Sodom and Gomorrah
Niggas dried up, laying in the box from the virus
Commercial thugs try to bust gats at the livest
This life of crime only will shine real survivors
Y'all half-way niggas, I advise you not to try this
So brace yourself before you get yourself laced
Fucking with the sick Arabic Scarface
La ilaha illallah illallah
You're fucking with the God that's Gomar Oz Dubar
Official, my missile rips through your bone gristle
While you sneak thieving niggas get locked and blow the whistle
For the jake, my mouthpiece remains minute
Team made my bail, scooped me up in the Lex Coupe
Now I'm out, back to the galaxy of Queens
In between the crime scenes serving fans like fiends
Fiends, fiends, fiends, so it seems
Eternally, the game reverse and burn me
My man turned state's and took the one to three
Snitching on me, how could it be? We was team
I guess we got divided by the cream
FBI ran in my crib, where I live
Snatched my wife, child welfare took my kids
Yo I can't live, I got hit with double life bid
From the stress, my head throbbing like a tumor
Its one o'clock, make a salaat, I catch Jumu'ah
Lay down my towel slide off my suede Pumas
The rumors spread around the jail like that
Been down for six joints holding down this flat
Latin Kings do they thing, ice pick for gat
Trying to lay my God Body cats all on they back
But never that

[Outro]
Yo, QBC, Two-Five and Mobb Deep
Mami, rest in peace
In sha'Allah
One love to that nigga Marley Marl

[Hook: Prodigy]
L.A. L.A. big city of dreams
But everything in L.A. ain't always what it seems
You might get fooled if you come from outta town
Cos we coming from Queens it gets down
