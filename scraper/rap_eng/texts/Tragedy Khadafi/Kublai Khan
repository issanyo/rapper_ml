[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]
God hates me, never keep my banger on safety
My mother raised me alone, you can't break me
My hearts pumpin' the blood of Royce Gracie
My thoughts dumpin' the slug and point straightly
You rhyme fakely, you still scarred
I'm studing deep thoughts like Bill Maher
I'm real raw, we just dumbin it out
And y'all ain't sayin' nothin' with a gun in yo mouth
That's what I'm about, but Vinnie Paz go deeper
Y'all still under the spell of dose ether
The Grim Reaper, its all nature
And every word from Allah is on paper
We all hate ya, we can't stand you
Chapter 8: Verse 3, Book of Daniel
You like a candle, you just burn
You never worship Allah, you can't learn

[Hook: Stoupe]
I melt mics 'til the sound waves - Nas
America's Cream Team - U-God
All y'all crab bitches ain't got to worry - Cappadonna
Brainwashed kid - Slick Rick
We're bombing this rhyme faker???

[Verse 2: Goretex]
Chemical, space ships, see dust splits, hit from the Matrix
Pig Destroyer, Anarchist kiss, splatter your patriots
Make coast stops, injectin' my pockets with Botox
Latex bitches be chokin' on cock like Blow-Pops
My flows hot, my Glocks like a popular friend
Sniffin' Oxycontin, we rock till the popular says
Merciful fate, we at the gates, I hurt you for cake
Cause Red Planets like a Shit Magnet, it counters with Jay
Digital cuffs, runnin' from the D's and the fuzz
Gut you out, rock Gas Mask, bleedin' an stuff
Into the void like blue velvet, goons and clerics
New synthetic designer jewels for moods in deserts
In heaven and earth, barcodes to measure my girth
That's like the J.D.L. joinin' the Zulu Nation for turf
Birth of the solar, we did so, write for the cobra
Goretex, freedom, and we all stand with iced out clothes

[Hook: Stoupe]

[Verse 3: Tragedy Khadafi]
Check it.. yo.. yo

Now what it be's like, niggas wanna stay tight, I stay right
Face fight, get your weak, split, shit then I spit
Most Accurate, Lex right in back of it
Range on the side of it Yo I'm tryin' to get a lot of it
I rock that exotic shit, spit the hottest shit
Blow trial, might get the same time Gigante get
Death before dishonor shit, gangster persona shit
Jedi Mind, 2-5 is who I polly with
When I'm tryin' to score the third, its who I holler with
Yo hood, its my project, exchange objects
Yo guns for my teks, yo range for my lex
From Q.B. to Philly, we control sets
I stay splurgin', heads stay wrapped in Turbans
Tighter than a virgin or Ford Excursion, nigga
So how you figure that we don't be reppin'
Wholesale drugs and weapons in the Dodge Intrepid, nigga

[Hook: Stoupe]

[Outro: Goretex]
Yo Stoupe, whattup baby, what's good
[Tragedy Khadafi]
Jedi Mind, the gracious, 2-5 collabo
Aura check
