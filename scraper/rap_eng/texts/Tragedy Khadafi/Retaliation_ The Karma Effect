[Verse 1: Tragedy]
Uh, Yeah, I'm back with a vengence, I hope you feel my presence
I'll leave your throat severed when you can't finish your sentence
That sounds tempting, a bloody mess with
Your shirt drenched in your blood pain never ending
I see your body trembling
Is it possible that the pain is spreading, I know what I'm sensing
You should've count your blessings when I leave you headless
You know I leave you breathless I hope you learned your lesson
You know what this track is you know retaliation
I'm retaliating, Retallying the times you fucked me over
Acting like a monster you're acting like an ogre
I thought a brother could get control over his boner
You never fight at my back like a fuckin' solider
You turn your back on me and give me the cold shoulder
My actions get colder
My lyrics get polar
I'll strike you like a bowler
No excuses you was sober
Floating triangles, squares, and circles boy you need to shape up
Wanna taste revenge when it lingers across your taste buds
I hope you sense the danger,I'll chase you with a razor
I'll cut your fucking throat while you say your fucking prayers
You used to be a stranger, Then you was a neighbor
I guesss you went back down to a fucking stranger
I don't even know you anymore I swear you fucking changed
They left me unrestrained. The act is unexplained
I've turned to drinking I really like that vodka
Theres a thing called payback, Its also known as karma
Wait til I get my hands on your fuckin momma
I'll hang her from a tree and I'll beat her like a pinata
I know I got you sweatin', step in to my sauna
I'm past the point of eruption you can melt in my lava
I'll tell you what now you may need a doctor
I don't think theres any hope I'm sure that you're a goner
Ask you again is there something you wanna share with me?
I wanna be clear in this moment of clarity
If you don't act carefully you'll be put in therapy
I swear your unbearable, like a pair of three
[Tragedy speaking]
Yeah how you like it so far?
I got one more verse for you buddy
Here it is
[Tragedy finishing verse]
You claim to be family, but you can't be
First class act applause you deserve a grammy
It was a cold act, in fact this act was clammy
You got broken legs, is that why you can't stand me?
I'm uncanny wouldn't stop a beat down even if I seen you damaged badly
Catch me In the alley, me and Cali, We stand our ground proudly
I promise there is no backing

[Verse2: Cali]
He ain't nothing but a bald face liar
Came outta jail acting like he went through fire
Spent about 48 hours behind the wire
The life he lead must be like froto and the shire
Look at you swag, mines through the roof
You try to fight me, I'm gonna break your fucking tooth
When you speak my name it's Tragedy in the booth
I'm spraying the ak going ham with no crew
I'm ice cold, heartless when I fucking shoot
No aim but my bullets still go through you
That lame ass apology we don't want that from you
Fuck his next girl, and we'll see what he'll do
5 weeks, and 5 days, while you sat loose
My boy sat in cell G5 where the fuck were you?
Telling the Jakes I really don't know who
Fire out Tragedys name like he was the goon
When I finish you they'll have to search the Lagoon
Me and my squad like a Vietnam Platoon
You the fucking Vietcong, we coming after you
So this is my final salute frome me to you
Fuck you and your life when you see me you better salute
