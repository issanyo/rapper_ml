Birthed into a fiery inferno
Faceless children inherit this hell
The modern currency: bomb shrapnel
And ammunition shells scattered in
The barren dearth and scarred hills
Where piles of human bones
Rise up from the arid earth
Like roots + litter the ground
With skulls + hardened flesh
The ravaged empty plot
With dismembered limbs and human ash
There are no gravestones here
There are no cemeteries here
There are no headstones here
To honour fallen ones
This site is desolate
The sight more desolate still
Scorched in summer by infernal heat
Swept in winter by bitter cold
Remnants of an unvanquished war
Remnants of a savage war
