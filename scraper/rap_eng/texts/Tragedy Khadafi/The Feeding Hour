Victims shrieking execrations
Thousands dead from heat prostration
Frightened by the beast on the other side
A mirrored nightmare poisoning blight
Remedies from the speeches of fools
Who gave us bandages to cure our disease
There will be no morals
Only each other left to eat
No one prays to the skies anymore
A cloud of ashen sickness
An unbreathable thickness
There will be no slumber when
Closing our eyes means certain death
The starvation marches have started
The scythe is being swung
Without aim or abandon
But we will carry on
The starvation marches have started
The bell will soon be rung
Marking the feeding hour
But we must carry on
