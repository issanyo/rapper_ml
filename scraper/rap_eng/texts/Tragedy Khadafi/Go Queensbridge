[MC Jade bka Tragedy the Intelligent Hoodlum]

Most exotic beats, high tempo and tone
My character and reputation may not be known
Rhymes I construct are emerged much greater
I’m the prince of poetry, and a rhyme narrator
Expressing these talents, rhymatical gift
The goal in my mind is frequently ??
I’m adored not a simulator as a rhyme biter
Only looked at as a poetry writer
My goals in life, as high as it can be
My comprehension, reading level, is 12.3
If you wanna get ill, watch how it’s done
We only had twelve battles, and all we won
MCs in the crowd, don’t try to riff
If you dare to cross paths, I’ll leave you stiff
You ignorant fool could never put me in fear
‘Cause I write like Mark Twain, recite like Shakespeare
A common MC, from off the block
And every time you say a rhyme all I hear’s "hip-hop"
The center of the streets is where your time is spent
You’re mentally ill, mechanically incompetent
I’m a headhunter and I’m going for kill
But enough about that - Hot Day, get ill!

Go Queensbridge! Go Queensbridge! Go Queensbridge!

The science of circumference down to my knees
Who keeps the cipher always going
360 degrees
I conduct electronics like an off and on switch
Most titans of the rhyme, is always a bitch
Produce bass and treble to control the pitch
My appeal and career as a talkologist
The old lyrical professor, greater not lesser
If you can’t fuck around, don’t play with the pressure
Hot Day’s nice and he’s on the cuts
He got a funky scratch to make you move your butt!

Go Queensbridge! Go Queensbridge! Go Queensbridge! (repeats to end)
