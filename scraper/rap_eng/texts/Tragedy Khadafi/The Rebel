[Verse 1]
I'm here to bust your shit, the mastermind of manuscripts
The force of extremity, my rhymes are the remedy
You can't deal with the T-R-A-G
Rap annihilist flowing like Pegasus
Rhyming this easily as the obvious
I bust your head pulsating rotating
This jam is generating with the motion I'm creating
I'm the boy wonder, Tragic super duper
Raised in the Bridge, cause I'm a Queensbridge trooper
The rebel of the treble, the ebony prince
'88 is on the way, I make a big difference
I make it visual and intellectually clear
(Tragedy) the Rebel is here

[Scratching]

[Verse 2]
Because I massacrate kids turning flesh to dust
And knocking all boots is a definite must
Cause I'm Havoc, Trag, Tragedy, Tragic
There are many ways to explain my magic
The explanatory category best fits me
Cause my lyrics are called sweet poetry
And I'm sick of b-boys just hipping and hopping it
I have you sayin, "Damn boy, shorty be dropping it"
Back in the '60s to know is to know it
And I'm the last remaining of the world's last poets
Talkologist, infinity from when I begin
And to disapprove the Trag is a mortal sin
Diabolical gangster, hoodlum and genius
I write poetry when I find it convenient
Snap a stage in half like a polar bear
(Your Tragedy) the Rebel is here

[Scratching]

[Verse 3]
I drop words you won't find in a dictionary
I write rhymes to improve my vocabulary
Drama, Art, English education
And I'm the man, I design the animation
Mentally and with jock control
The equalizer rises up on your FM mode
In which I use with telepath
And it's (Tragedy) who's on your phonograph
I confuse your conscience, and boggle your brain
You may think that I'm sick, but I'm perfectly sane
I design my rhymes with architectural construction
But that's another story, a different function
You see, it's mandatory to invoke fear
(Tragedy) the Rebel is here

[Scratch]

[Verse 4]
The rap automatical, the rhymatical
Forget ill, I get illmatical
Biceps pulsating in my lungs
Queensbridge Projects is where I'm from
Wicked like a witch doing sorcery
With a book and a pen, and my M-I-C
The outstanding ovation when things get drastic
You keep fantasizing while I'm fantastic
Black magic flowing smooth but strong
And I'll have you rocking and shocking

[Scratching]
