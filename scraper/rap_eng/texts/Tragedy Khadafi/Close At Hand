Choices are made, their bidding is done
Capitulation willing, tranquility consumed
And so here we are to confront yet again
Our willingness to accept
The fate they are prepared to give
Pills administered as the i.v. drips
The shots are given but the pain subsists
Black hole approaching, cold darkness takes hold
Take one last breath as the final curtains close
Imminent impendent doom
Close at hand
