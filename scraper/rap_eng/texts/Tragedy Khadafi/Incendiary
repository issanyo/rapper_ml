Pressure builds, ready to blow, flammable device
Set to explode, ire stabbing, never fades
Migraine fury, venemous rage, locked and loaded
Soon the snap, lost sanity, no looking back
Tolerance running low, day by day impatience grows
Peddlers of hope promising salvation, closing their
Eyes, proclaiming peace in a wartorn world of misery
Of misery, optimism is the madness of insisting that

All is well in a sea of disease, sea of disease
Do you feel the scalding heat? do you feel the urgent beast?
Do you feel the last hopes fading?
Incendiary, incendiary, incendiary, set to explode
