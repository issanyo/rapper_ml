[ VERSE 1: Tragedy ]
I keep strivin and never quit
Until I make the jam that hits
Cause my name is Trag and Trag never quits
Even though I had doubts in the back of my mind
And I felt like givin up from time to time
But I was destined for fame and one day I would shine
Cause I don't need rings and a fat gold chain
All I need is a aim and a positive brain
Cause you gotta stay strong and go for yours
Trials and tribulations form detours
But I keep on movin and never throw the towel in
Hungry, cause my stomach's growlin
Fame is a pool and in it I'm divin
I keep movin and keep on strivin
Keep strivin

Keep strivin
Keep strivin
Keep strivin

[ VERSE 2: Tragedy ]
You wanna hear hard times? Man listen
The Trag didn't even have a pot to piss in
I was sick of police snatchin me up by the collar
Cause I was on the block tryin to make a fast dollar
Cause I need money but crime's not the answer
Now I'm making money with my DJ and my dancer
When things got rough I had to sell my cable
Cause I couldn't get a deal from a record label
In the rap game you're bound to get jerked
But I kept the dream, then I put it to work
Kept my eyes upfront cause I couldn't look back
And I never had time for the jealous crap
Cause whether you're doin wrong or you're livin good
Somebody's gonna say you're not doin what you should
The more I learned the less I could care
Cause criticism is somethin I'm not tryin to hear
Fame is a pool and in it I'm divin
I keep movin and keep on strivin
Keep strivin

Keep strivin
Keep strivin
Keep strivin

[ VERSE 3: Tragedy ]
When the road gets rough and life gets trife
Just bear it, you're gonna have to sacrifice
Cause in this world only the strong survive
Many a mornings I've searched for a nine to five
My stomach growlin and my pockets hurt
And for the whole week I wore the same t-shirt
But I came too far just to turn around
So kept my mind on the higher ground
More sessions in the studio got delayed
(Yo man, today Kane's workin) Yeah, I got played
Hangin up at this radio station every week
Just to get on the mic and get a chance to speak
Just to show my talent like I knew I could
Cause deep in my heart I knew I was good
Motivation would build my skill
I never gave up and I never will
I take the chance to go for mine
So lay down the track and watch me shine
With dreams, some try to tear it
Hold me back and break my spirit
I battle and fight cause the struggle gets longer
The more you doubt, it makes me stronger
Fame is a pool, so let me dive in
I keep movin and keep on strivin
Keep strivin
