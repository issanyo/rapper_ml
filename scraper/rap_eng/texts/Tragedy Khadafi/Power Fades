We have waited, weak + lone
For your coming, mighty one
Our pockets empty, our spirits cold
Give us glory for blood + gold
To the earth their power fades
Like a dying prayer almost silent
Whispering: we have been triumphed
And anarchy, the skeleton
Bowed + grinned to everyone
To the earth their power fades
Police + priests, a sick charade
And to the earth their power fades
