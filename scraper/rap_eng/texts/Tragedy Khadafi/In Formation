They juggle their numbers, they examine their charts
The sum of our ignorance, they submit their reports
Year after year, information is suppressed
After years of toil and strife and decades of debate
The equation is solved correctly, all scientists
Finally agreed, happily report their findings
Too late to turn back now happily report
Report their findings: all life will cease to be
The defeat of mankind lies not in their answers
But in the question that we never asked in
The arrogance of our waste, in the knowledge we refused
To retain and when the waves hit again, with baffled
Blankness they'll stare, clutching their possessions to their
Watery grave, destruction no technology could save
Nature's final lesson: no one shall be spared
