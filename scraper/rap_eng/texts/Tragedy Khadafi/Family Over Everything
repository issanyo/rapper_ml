It's funny how u played me, u played me for a bitch
This the 2nd time nigga that u played for that bitch
U only 17 & u act like that's yo wife
In the end when she gone u will see that I was right
Family over everything that's what it suppose to be
But that just ain't how u think cuz u choose yo bitch over me
It's funny how u let take over yo whole life
U just left me in the dark while u out walkin the light
Man u know that shit ain't right
Ima be there when she gone
& she know wtf she doin & she know that shit is wrong
She got yo brain in her pocket zipped it up put a lock on it
I try to tell u what she doin but I guess it ain't no stoppin it
I tell u what u can have that bitch
I'm done with this shit
Nigga fuck that bitch
