Intro:

Let me ask you a question: Have you ever been shackled on a bus?
Are you afraid to die? Most of y'all niggas never did bids. Your hands
Never got dirty. Me, myself, I'm a thug - and I live and die for this
Shit. 25 To Life - the entity - forever and ever. Yo...

Imam T.H.U.G.:

Yo, they label us bastards
Raised in pen maxes
Hydro - blow 'til I burn in platinum ashes
Make it hard for niggas who blast, try and get at this
Two-Five - flooded with thugs in black mas'es
Station me ?, pants sag, divine masters
Comin' with drugs - o.d., your brain's captured
See my life condemned to weed and chrome biscuits
Ghetto sheist' fake emcees and crack infants
Murder one - killer disease my life sentence
Exit one - enter with truth, combined vengeance
Who'd ever think - we could blow and be spectacular?
Thug blazin' my gun, still comin' after ya
Tackle ya - bent, I snatch you out the Acura
Or Lex' bubble - scuffle, rise when you tumble
Bloodsucker - won't be sweet when mine's touch ya
Now pass that - lyrically strapped, attack that

Chorus(x2):
Yo, black gloves, black mask
Sit at the table like the Maffia and life ya glass
When it's time to go to war, who be the first to blast?
Real niggas shoot first and ask questions last

Tragedy Khadafi:
Yo, my last days on the Earth, bury me in the Bridge
My worst fear is a stray bullet killin' a kid
Born and raised where the fiends live
My pops did a state bid
All my niggas is locked and full of hatred
We can't make it
Caught in the beast, tied naked
That's why I spit immortal thug shit on every record
It's thug apparel
Resurrect the crime pharaoh
My thoughts travel
Like hollow tips through the barrel
It's all official
I hold a laser beam tryin' to hit you
My team died and came back, that's how we come to get you
My Arab missile penetratin' through your body tissue
Kidnap your wife and your kids - make it a foul issue
Cime rate, violate, guerrilla mind state
We all tryin' to escape - clappin' at the jakes(pap)
The holy wars - my soul be inside of yours
For all my niggas who brawl - locked behind the walls
For all my niggas who brawl - locked behind the walls

Chorus(x2)

Yo, yo
My life every day livin' Henney and weed
I know I need to slow down my speed
The police break me off with somethin' I don't need
Have me caught up in the law 'til I'm forced to bleed
My niggas fall on the floor and give Allah they plea
While this black cloud follows everywhere I be
Have me scared up in the mirror at the man I see
Flip constantly - cause my lady killed my seed
Took his life - 'fore he even had a chance to breathe
Said she killed him cause she didn't want him growin' like me
Like the Godfather Part III as far as I see
Try to stop me? I thought we had love, acqui
Older niggas comin' home, younger niggas get stuck
It's like - havin' weed and not havin' a dutch
Type fucked up - knowin' that you could get bucked
Leave the 'hood, try to come back, and then get stuck
Leave the 'hood, try to come back, and then get stuck

Chorus(x2)

My friend is losing his mind... for fear of going insane
My friend is losing his mind... for fear of going insane
My friend is losing his mind... for fear of going insane
My friend is losing his mind... for fear
