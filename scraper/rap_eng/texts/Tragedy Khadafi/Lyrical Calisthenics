[Verse 1:]
Define me as the greatest
Came off a year hiatus
Reemerged on the scene draped in the latest
My third eye shine when the Ds try to invade us
Ambidextrous my gun hand switch just like fate is
Infiltrators and haters bless the earth
And the mothers who made us
Real shit I submit to my creator
Watchin Feds watchin me and possibly
The god be laying up in the palace sippin on Dom P
Queens servin me salad the most violent
The one MCs fear to challenge
When apprehended by the beast my code of silence
We exist in a war of violence
Just a glimpse inside a gangster mind, my true talent
A revelation for this thug nation
For the fans patiently waiting I spit it hotter than Satan
Making the streets form and join my congregation
Yeah, the thug nation

[Hook:]
The trial is to feel that I'm in a race win it
Benz pedal to the medal till my breathe diminish
Alpha to Omega man till the cycle is finished
Life still moves on and the earth is still spinnin'
What I spit make the dead raise up and start livin'
Facing the man in the mirror existence is clearer
What it's worth true purpose, Modern Day Che Guevara
What it's worth true purpose, Modern Day Che Guevara

[Verse 2:]
Your Highness in every line is
Spontaneous combustion from the mind is
Just a young dude with the wisdom like the old timers
I let the beat the dictate my mind state
On any given day, trust me the real relate
Like violators going down state, we migrate
The crime rate increases, when I release the illest thesis
The beast love eating dark meat, endangered species
And right about now my style is like the biblical times
Burnin bushes red seas partin as I recline
Submittin' to the most high, embracin' all my nines
True story, forever shine but in due time
Bear witness a thugs drama I switch the aura holdin' a torah
Ridin shotgun in the impala
Thoughts of slayin?
Black Hand the Vatican Third World the 'sama
Time ta separate the real from the fraudulent
Cause being broke is too intense
See the world through Armani specs
It's the struggle and revolution that I represent
And I'm just playing my part, layin' getting bent
And I'm just playing my part, just layin' getting bent

[Repeat Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
The All Eye seein, Whatever happened to the art of MC'in
And rappers steady G'in as I hold a Mic tight
Open my eyes mind free in the zone
94 million miles away from home my throne made of chrome
Was a young one lost in the hood, now that I'm grown
Seein life with a realer purpose
Counterfeit spirits they fear it cause they just show the surface
And time'll tell, I seen some warriors die in a cell
Broken hearted, daily departed they soul just fell
Outside under the spell
My rhymes sacred like the Arch, or the covenant
The streets lovin it, arrest the president
Overthrowin' a dark government
Allustrious the gods flow, it's similar to dutches
Perfectly wrapped around dro
Street scholar like honorable Elijah Muhammad
Without the nation of Farrakhan movin behind it
Accurate timin with nines in the minks linen
Reinstated though I'm constantly hated I'm still shinin
The greatest story never told
But now manifested on a desert scroll, The arms I hold
Never stressin, Mic's I'm blessin the truth unfolds
Never stressin, Mic's I'm blessin the truth unfolds
