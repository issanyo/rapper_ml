Like prisoners in the perfect jail
The workers needn't be watched
Because they watch themselves
Not only those who give the orders
But those who command what orders to give
We are guard and guarded at once
Status, position, competition, reward
We are guard and guarded at once
Misdirection, deception, illusion, control
Teetering just on the edge, the edge of the abyss
The meaningless nothing, the grim infinite
We are guard + guarded at once
