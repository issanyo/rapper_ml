[Tragedy Khadafi]
Master the craft, master the style
Fastening these rap crabs on my nuts
But meanwhile like an asshole everybody got an opinion
Blast on these rap fools trying to conquer my dominion
Insecure aura's, try to belittle my character
Assassinate their whole plot
Look what you got for being weaker then the greater man
Lay where you rock
It's not about what I achieve or possess physically
It's more about respect and love, I show me
The streets don't define me I define the streets
Cowards bow down; G's just destroy the weak
Tomorrows neva promise, I accomplish enough
And one day just incase tomorrow neva came
If life is a game then I'm MVP
Most Valuable Player outta QBC
See I respect game so game respect we
Revolver's trustworthy automatic is the seed
Like seeing the affidavit, I'll buy your CO-D
El-Badji owe a death when I've touch the track
My lines is like methadone laced wit crack

I want my environment to be a product of me
