With step as soft as wind it passed
Over the heads of men so fast
That they felt the presence there
And looked and all was empty air
And the prostrate multitude looked and
Ankle deep in blood, trudged along
Without aim, trudging through
The freshly slain
Rise like lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number
Shake your chains to earth like dust
Which in sleep enveloped us
And anarchy, the ghastly birth
Lay deadened earth upon deadened earth
The horse of death whose hooves did grind
To dust the murderers from behind
A fervent chorus from beneath was
Heard + felt + at its close
A fervent chorus from beneath
These words of hate + fear arose:
Rise like lions after slumber
In unvanquishable number
Shake your chains to earth like dust
Which in sleep enveloped us
We are many, they are few
We are many
