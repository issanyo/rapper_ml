Marching in tandem, they come in drones*
Strictly waiting with their strongest intent
Polishing their guns and boots
Searching for moments of truth
They wait for direct orders under someone
Somewhere's sure fire command, polishing their guns and boots
And despite all... despite all the cries and screams
And despite all... despite all the death and defeat
Watching closely with absolute refusal to see
Searching for truths predetermined
Salivating for action, for god and country
Eyes glazed over with fear and confusion
Muscles tense from anxiety and fatigue
Senses overloaded from constant manipulation
And despite all... despite all the cries and screams
And despite all... despite all the death and defeat
Blindly they take closer aim
