Mouths hang agape and drool
Mumbling incoherent anthems of acceptance and fidelity
Trained by clever men
Hell, hell is here
In hidden laboratory backrooms splicing atoms
Reducing humanity to a study on a slide
With microscopes staring deeper into eyes glazed over by fear
And desensitization from injected violence and reruns of cops
With rods they prod at our culture: scanning for DNA
And an elusive gene that they can steal bottle
And sell for profit as the next new thing
Radiation settles, water turns black with ash and discharge
Chemical imbalance
Laden with synthetics, genetically engineered life end sustenance
Ingredients unknown
Chemical imbalance
Hell, hell is here
