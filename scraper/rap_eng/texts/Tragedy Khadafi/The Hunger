A fire sparks inside after a drought was declared
Ashes once dormant react and ignite
Chain reaction follows, reaction follows
Distraction on distraction, no tears will flow tonight
The corpse of the vanquished fight comes to life
Comes to life, what was forgotten now takes over
The mighty fools revelled in their victories too soon
Undead in our spirit to consume their fragile rule
Do you feel it? do you understand?
Do you feel it? do you understand?
Do you feel the hunger for the freedom to be free
Do you feel the thirst for something not so incomplete

As the sinking world we find ourselves
Forcefed to accept, as the stinking world we find
Ourselves repeating to reject, to reject
Do you feel it? do you understand?
Do you feel it? do you understand?
Do you feel it do you feel it, do you feel it
Do you feel it do you feel it, do you feel the hunger?
Do you understand?
