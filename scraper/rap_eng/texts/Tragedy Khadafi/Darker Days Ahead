Embracing the aftershock, prepared for loss
Stoking the fires of destruction
Basking in the blistering heat
I never think of the future, it comes soon enough
We never think of the future, it comes soon enough
Temperatures rising, storm clouds descend
On ignorant hordes, manipulation + control
By unseen forces in plain view before us
To their gods the tyrants pray
On the weak the vultures prey
We fight still through subversion
Until the foundation rots away
Darker days ahead, we have darker days ahead
