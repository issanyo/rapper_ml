[Intro:]
Sometimes they call you OG
They don't mean it they just calling you old
You got to read in between it
My ghetto path worldwide
7 continents the hoods worldwide

[Verse 1:]
Little man called me old head I kinda got offended
Principals to the street shit so shawty you suspended
Don't make me reach inside these stretchers
Shoot these niggers off the benches
My architect is armagen specialize in holding weapons
But your intentions really be trying to saying you washed up
I’m armied up what the fuck you little niggers all stuck
Yeah we all buck bumped and confused like
It's all a common like the time i got here
I was in your shoes for some hot gears

[Chorus:]
But i remember the time they call you OG
They don't mean it they just calling you old
You got to read in between it
My ghetto car path worldwide
7 continents the hoods worldwide
Sometimes they call you OG
They don't mean it they just calling you old
You got to read in between it
My ghetto car path worldwide
7 continents the hoods worldwide

[Verse 2:]
See I was raised around niggers who were raised around animals
And they ain't scrambling street dice gambling
Dope spot coke spot no lo trying to dodge swat
Most niggers snitch till they get shot
Eh yow blood covers humanism this is to expand the plan
Afghanistan pack of wolves you all a pack of lambs
Yow the aftermath is damn nigga hit you for a half a grand
Should have asked you man like what up dazzled in

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
You see they use and they sell cocaine i don't understand it
She ain't bring home too much still
And got remanded you gotta watch who you talk to
These young niggers never listen
They fuck around and put us in a bad position
It's a paint brush around my life is a living canvas
Even if his life is behind the bars is better than the average
A savage man street life we make the marriage the status
Rocking king turn isis four carrots

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
All the drug dealers inquiring interested in retiring
Four one K no that one came with it
He tried and he done did it then strippers we done hit it
Cause we done driven those houses got pools in them
Yow geese give a nigga somewhere to breathe
Jesus of nazareth if you really if you really get catch
I’ll find your life getting sealedin the coffin
Aerostyle on nexus
Billionaire dreams to reach the masses
Watching from Jake behind attend from classes

[Chorus]
