My mind shut off like a switch on a machine*
Rejecting all pleasure, denying all pain
Numbing of senses, body decays
Panic! panic! rabid panic
Caught in a shadow of doubt and confusion
Panic coursing through panic veins
Eager patients, we swallow with ease
Keeping us sedate
Panic! panic! rising panic
Like death walking, struggle each day
Go through the motions, fight to maintain
Panic! panic! rising panic panic! panic! rabid panic
Panic! panic! rising panic panic! panic! rabid panic
