(Tragedy talking)
Line up, word, G-Formation, Grizzlies
Militant Mind State, word, fo'real
I ride till the sun burn out

[Tragedy Khadafi]
Yo, yo, perpendicular gun spray, prolific my word play
Last Castle Ambassador, my hood neva decays
I'm the soil to the foundation, birth of a nation
For my fans patiently waiting spitted hotter then WHO?
My only challenge is "I" the reflection of "MY"
Own image what I envision, immortalize neva die
Rather die for cause then because to die
For no cause at all
While my soul get trapped in street wars
Ice Bengal, thug angel, the other half seems demonic
Based on what I've been thru in the worlds largest projects
Spitting in the face of the judge
Grill the jury, trapped in a hole like Saddam
Get caught in my blind fury
My rhymes express the scars that I bare in my face
Finger and arms, I want peace but stay tucked in my waist
I been laced by snakes betrayal
Smile in your face then spray you
Rather kill you then love you
The truth so they slay you...
