[Havoc] Illegal life...
[Capone] Illegal life...

[Capone] Take over...son...
[Havoc] Know Wha Saying...41st side

[Hook: Havoc]
We hate the law so we break it
Loyal to this life there's no way to escape it
You either make it or you take it
If the game's in you, dedicated stay true
Illegal Life

[Noreaga]
Yo, I was in Ramada, laid up with Goldschlager
Jungle room, cowboy hat around June
Monaga, had the 45th draga
Capone-N-Noreaga, the saga, sega, mega, network and bodega
Dream marvellous, scandalous, black mantis
Illegal life is like my A-alike
We B-Alike, hustle night to life
Desert storm, and cold form on your dorm
Run through, hard-boil you like John Woo
The law we hate, drop a cake cut like mix tape
Spoil coke plate, you buying fake weight
The next day, contemplate and score jake
Jesus, conduce, claim Bishop in Juice
Bloody up your goose, now who scream for truce
Lefrak is Iraq, illegal life contract
Keep 'em back, load up the big macs

[Hook]

[Capone]
We hate the law, escalated war with jake, raise the crime rate
Criminal minds regulate the tri-state
The legacy it never end, illegal life veteran salute
Get loot and stay true, corrupt jake make it happen
Snatch 'em catching oz's, put the game on freeze
Dedicated hustling won't stop regardless
Whatever charges, getting the dough til you go
Observation, direct sale, connects giving, reaching for ceiling
On the streets again, wild born, the enemy became your best friend
Meet the game closer, maped out many ways to get rich
[Havoc] Ay yo, for real crime pays

[Capone]
9 6 the deal, we real about this cheddar, forever
Corner standing, in any weather, heat holding you down
Controlling your ground, stick-up kids come around
And taste the pound, CNN, put our soul on the line
For this life of crime, 2 5 forever shine

[Noreaga]
9 6 stay hungry, son collect monthly
While the streets change, me and my man remain tough (ly)

[Hook]

[Noreaga]
C A P O N E with me, Papi, Hav and Pee
Tradegy Khadafi, N O Y D, a man and me
On some mobb shhh, spark up cigar shhh
Cubans sit back jack, my niggas smoke dat
Generate, be the coke razor on a coke plate
Back up the crime son, and try to see a triple double
And get my loot back on a time table
Ay yo it's CNN, you soon to see us on cable
At the round table, networked through the label

[Havoc]
Illegal life, illegal life, illegal life
Illegal life, illegal life, illegal life
