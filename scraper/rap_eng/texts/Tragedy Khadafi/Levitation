[Verse 1: MC MajeK]

I create crates of imagination
Mental levitation toss thoughts if they're imitations
I'm medicated, elevated, zen meditations
Store enough energy to crush four full nations
You're chasing weed traces while MC's walking jade adjacent
Rappers are sloppy, trying to copy
Need new hobbies rocking Abercrombie
So check it get closer
My grim rep amp pulses
Peep the flow repulser from the verse holster
Rehearse battles in a bandana cloaker
Musical soldier-turned beast strike like a cobra
Word heard verbs curve like a Wanted bullet
Crews get critically smashed if you run into it
My mind twist text and eject projectiles
Protect your child if MC switch his style to wildebeest
Willed to be Alpha Savage other rappers can't match this
Master of the cloak; try looking catch a stroke
Nigga
