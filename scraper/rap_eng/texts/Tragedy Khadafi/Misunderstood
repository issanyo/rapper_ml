Tragedy Verse 1

Drago, Scorzayzee, Khaddafi
Q.B to Nottingham
And everything in between

“take a look at me”
Look at me
“take a look at me”
Look at me Mother F******

Struggle in my veins
And my medallion and gold chain
Is pain
Word to the bloodstains of George Jackson
Flee the courtroom
Camouflaged with guns packed in
Verbally holding
And I been nice since
I sat in my pop’s scrotum
Khadaff blow em
Lyrical omen
Moving like the shogun
Sit on the throne when I’m zoning
Naturally king it’s birthright and melatonin
So walk with me
Travel the hood
Ghetto savagery
My faculty
Cut from the same fabric as tragedy
All things conceived in live thoughts
Salute to them O.G’s who hug the sky for it
N***** talking all that paper but they don’t see it
Lebron when I ball
You’re stuck paraplegic
You can’t talk this shit here without breathing it
Your highness
Q.B’s finest
N***** that’s no secret
Your highness
Q.B’s finest
N***** that’s no secret

Chorus
I’ll always love
I’ll always love
I’ll always
I’ll always
I’ll always love

You ooh ooh
You ooh ooh you
Ooh you ooh you ooh ooh

Verse 2 Scorzayzee

I’m jumping out the Trojan horse
Like what you quoting homer for?
You're Tony on the phone
I close your vocal chords
With no remorse
It’s lonely when there’s no support
And spitting is your only sport
An army of over 400 kickstarted Scorz into a holy war
With 50 A.k’s
Roly-polys on the frozen floor
This pompous life of pompadours and Zaza Gabors
Get punished like Pompeii do whatever the songs say
They loving Beyonce but no-speaka the Anglais
That’s why I say my piece
Staple the paper to the face of these
Hateful creatures and reverse their facial features
Pray and face the east
Wander through these ancient streets
Tell Owais this time I really blazed the beat
From Sneinton to the states we’re taking taking major leaps
Peace to the all the peeps in the grumbling stomach of the beast
We’re fire in the streets but staying humble when we greet
Smile like the master doing Zikr in his sleep
Flicking the Zikr beads from a couple of hundred feet
If it’s a mystery you seek then the history is deep
The system like a wolf creeping sleeping with a sheep
They teach me with the bleach of a pre-written speech
But I say peace to the puzzle til I reach missing piece
Take a look at me
Take at look at me
Take a look
A friend ashamed
Misunderstood
Misunderstood

Yo shouts out to Tragedy Khadafi
QB to Nottingham
But up to everyone who supported all these years
It’s all love
We’re just misunderstood man

Peace To the Puzzle…
