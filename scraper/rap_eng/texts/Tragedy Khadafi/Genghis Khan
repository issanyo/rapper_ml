[Intro: Tragedy Khadafi]
You about to witness a 2-5/Jedi Minds collabo
You know what I mean?
The God Jus Allah, you know?

[Verse 1: Jus Allah]
Megatraum is a Martian, feeding off weed and cash
I dash from my ship in the Roswell crash
You smash when you bash with the clashing ox
Saw you in half without a fucking magical box
Wet pussy always seems to splash my cock
I'm dead, they just didn't leave the casket locked
Pass my block I let shots drill in your spleen
We ill marines with hand held killing machines
Steal dreams with the armored steel, guard your grill
Nigga, I was brought up by the Kents in Smallville
Following Allah's will, harboring the skill
Caught up in the real, don't give me cause to kill
Nocturnal, I stroll where the darkness goes
If I had to follow the moon across the globe
With the staff and white robe, I still hold metal
Disciples who walk on glass and rose petals

[Hook: Tragedy Khadafi & Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Yo, last rites, we fast to blast twice
Jedi Mind 252 we mad nice
We smash mics, and blast too precise
Fast 40 days and pray for 40 nights

[Verse 2: Ikon the Verbal Hologram]
Yo, I'm savage, I write rhymes in pitch blackness
Any motherfucker that front, is left backless
Y'all motherfuckers just burn into ashes
Trying to step into the zone where Vinnie Paz is Black Sabbath
Put a slug in his grill
Because Jedi Mind, Two-Five thugging for real
You ever think there might be trouble then peel
Because a motherfucker like me dumping to kill
Y'all better pass the mic cause Vin's ill
Y'all learn the Facts Of Life from Kim Fields
I don't know how many kids my flow harmed
My gun control leaves y'all with no arms
Y'all ever smell the stench of dead bodies?
Left in the path of the Paz and Khadafi
5'9", tatted up, mad stocky
Animal thug who bust slugs in the lobby

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tragedy Khadafi]
I hit the turnpike on dirtbike with 2 heaters
On my way to Philly to fight for Mumia
Only thug guerillas will react to this
The laws try to destroy black activists
Half of y'all is performers and actresses
I keep at least a 100 grand in the mattresses
Shit so hot, soon as I write it I get indicted
I dare one y'all scared niggas to bite it
I done stood in hood lobbies getting my rocks off
With longjohns and 3 pairs of socks on
Ducking from the pigs so I don't get knocked off
Or popped off, and y'all thugs is soft
That's why your skirt get pulled up, clothes come off
Red Dragons, can't even fuck with my brain pattern
I'm online, Pentium Plus and Benz wagon
Mahdi, believe me it do ring bells
If you saw me do dirt you won't live to tell
I'd done lived in a cell, did bids in hell
Held niggas at gunpoint for ransom and bail

[Hook]
