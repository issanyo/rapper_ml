Hey yo, hey yo DUS what up man?
You already, you already know man
Two-five-two collabo

[Verse 1:Tragedy Khadafi]
Yeah... yo, yo
Raw narcotic lines, ya'll niggas still pushing garbage
Realer than ghetto soldiers dying inside of my projects
Analyze the livest, Kemetic hood prophet
I'll pull a ratchet fast, leave your whole body topless
Connect the most toxic, verbal fiber optics
UFO's unidentified flying objects
Peep the last of the, streets embrace me like ambassadors
What up brethren?, icon Legend like an Acura
On some classic shit, my Dutch is always lit
Food for the maggots, rotting slow that's what you get
Hip-Hop is resurrected, Netflix in the Lexus
I build with earths head covered, my science perfected
Connect with white dudes, attitude is most spiteful
Maki you the most trifle, rap goon with a rifle
I rep the East like Mello in starting positions
And I do it for political prisoners, yeah!
