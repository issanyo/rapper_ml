[Hook: Havoc]
Yo, parole violating fugitives on the run, son
Live by the gun, son, die by the gun, son
We can make it happen if we want to
Jakes'll get that ass quick if they really want you

[Noreaga]
Capone, you stay on street, and keep the cipher complete
2 5 circle, caught you snitching now we hurt you
Fake Scarface, coming out your mouth all loose
He think he thugging it, ice mugging it
‘Cause he drugging it
My rap loot, I still shoot
Ask Irak (Lefrak), you better bust back
Keep it like that
Real fact - my life revolve around gat
The heat is god
Guard me, like bodyguard
TNT, ESPN, CNN
We each bring 10, stick em up and break wind
Zion little royaum, he up in Tryon
Pumps he rule, run through, yo god - you
I got God-You, for him and you
Greg Tate (asshole), leave his mouth taped
Eliminate, news on BET, got pictures of me
Killer ki, the F.B.I. scanned the blocks
Use photography, want me and my team out the country (stay low)
Key Largo, shipped the cargo, back to Fajardo
In P.R., kid I came home on my C-R
Crisis, 2-5-to, we rock ices
Castro castrate, put the bogie out in his face
Leave him scraped, you fake nigga move fake
In Lefrak we regulate... what, what, what, buck-buck, what

[Hook]

[Tradegy Khadafi]
Khadafi L-I-C, that ol' fly shit
Coming from the Bridge, Kuwait, do or die shit
Jose Luis and Irak recognize it
You get laced before the jakes realize it
Guerrilla form all in your dorm
Don't be surprised, kid
Weak trick - go ‘head and snitch like your man did
War Report, cut ya life short
Babe Ruth niggas ain't ready for blood sport
Yo, we masked up, pointing the heat
Duct-tapin' her, gag her mouth so she can't scream
Start rapin' her
Camcorder, you won't miss it ‘cause we taping her, rapin' her
Fed Ex, you got the tape next day in the mail
Now you organize your team with gats, ready to bail
But you 180, my reactions 360
You ass-betting, know where I'll be
So come get me
Khadafi, gun-play
Artie Clay, use a Legal Aid
Tryin to go to trial with the DA
What!
