Like pawns on a chessboard, we are directed
Shuffled, misplaced and used to build a barrier
Between madmen and their enemies
In the eyes, in the eyes of madmen
In the minds, in the minds of madmen
Peace is a privelege reserved for those
Who can afford not to fight in the wars
They created, in the wars they create

In the eyes, in the eyes of madmen
In the minds, in the minds of madmen
In the eyes of madmen, we are just figures on a chart
We are just barriers in their path towards world
Domination, domination, domination
