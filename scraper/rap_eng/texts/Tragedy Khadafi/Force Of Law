Blindly followed out of fear*
Out of desperation for something more than this
The remnants of a life once significant
The remnants of minds once thoughtful
The remnants of hopes once realized
The force of law, the defeating of all life
The defeating of all life, defeat, defeat
Kept in line for years and years
Patience, obedience, clenching fists
The force of law, the defeating of all life
The defeating of all life, defeat, defeat
The pressure's mounting, shown in our vacant eyes
Hardened by never ending stares and obstacles
Unsurmountable, unsurmountable
Blindly followed out of fear
Blindlow followed history
Blindly followed out of obedience
Blindly followed out of fear, fear, fear
