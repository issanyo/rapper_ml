[Tragedy Khadafi]
Mahdi Khadafi all Haile Selassie
Federal Agents is flagrant trying to knock me
Merge from the block, cooked up coke and rocks be
It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back
America fears the planet that's consumed by blacks
Cointele pro crucifier Black Messiah
Flyest attire neva snitch neva wear a wire
Deep as the abyss, struggle for peace
The street enlightener, heart of a ridah
Soul of a freedom fighter
'71 Attica riots, so nighter
What I write excites the hood, the streets in hell
Double-life niggas locked in jail
Whether heaven or hell comrade prevail
I spit it Godly, genetically is in my melanin
Predicate felon to enemy shots I'm sending
A legend like Bob Marley when I'm reciting this venom
