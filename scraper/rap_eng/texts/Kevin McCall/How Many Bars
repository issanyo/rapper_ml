[Verse 1:]

California's back, thanks to K-Mac
I'm at the top like a high note
Killin' for Survival, Jeffrey Dahmer I'ma slaughter every beat that im on
Y'all were sleeping on me, so I had to turn the lights on
Running red lights, but I ain't fucking on her site though
Bad like Michael, modest Revitalaigo
All black everything
You'd swear you got your eyes closed
The label's spoilin' us
Probably out, voyagers
Got so many trucks
They call the dealership Toys R Us
I don't wanna grow up
Black Peter Pan
The mansion's so big
I call it Never-Never Land
I'm flyer than the bitch
And I don't think I'll ever land
If you think im the shit now
Just wait 'till I hit the fan
Damn, here we go again
More money more problems
When will it ever end?
For me it never will
Cause I keep getting richer
But when you go to heaven
You can't take the money with you
Why you think I never trip
I say it like this
Yeah it's a man's world
Life is a bitch
And I'm tryna fuck her
Fuck her real good
And I don't need a chorus
Cause I'mma have her hooked
Hooked like phonics
Nigga I wrote the book
I'm still writing history
Money don't mean shit to me
I'm making all the hits so you can call it flawless victory
If you got haters you're doing something right, so I don't let it get to me
If you want a feature then you gotta go through Tiffany
Call it family buisness we taking over the industry
So now it's too late to put your bid in
That's the reason they call me K-magnificent
Funny when the tables turn around, pay back
The truth will set you free so I'mma testify and say that
Balling like a preacher, catch me rollin' in my maybach
I'm shinning cause I blew myself up, Arab

[Outro:]
It's just something for the streets
Now how many bars was that? I dont feel like counting 'em, I'mm too busy counting money
Oh you wanna know who made the beat? That would be me
Oh you wanna know who wrote it? That would be me to
K-mac, holla
