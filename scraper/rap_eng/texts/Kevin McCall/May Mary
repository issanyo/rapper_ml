[Verse 1]

Love is war not a fight
So turn off the lights
And put this on
So me and you can make love all night
Love over lust
Faith over trust

I see that true love is blind
Just this one time see
With your heart and not with your eyes

(Oh pretty baby)

I'm the king your the queen living this black Americano dream Like prince hakim girl your my Lisa
No breezy baby but your royalty
Provide you love and loyalty
Instead of half it, you get all of me
My home is your throne
Me and you are one
So your never alone

Running thru my mind like a marathon
Let you come first I pass you my baton
You make a blind man wanna
See light again ain't got no time for

(no shade)

So fine even miles Brock wanna hit it....

(No shade)

You wear the crown backward like a LA fitted yeah

[Hook]

Searching for my future Queen
Imma arry Mary
Kevins jewler diamond ring
Imma marry Mary
Let's go half on a baby
Wish I could make one with you now
Cause you're my ride or die
Go 'head and ride dah dah dah dah-dide all night

[Verse 2]:

I got a APB out on my own family
I don't even get to see my baby girl
And she live in Cali
Still treated me like a Eastside Nigga
When I moved way to the valley

Ain't personal because I know they don't really
Know shit about me Even though they talk shit about me
Even though all the blogs write shit about me
Thank God for Sunday because Love that's what you found me
I would say f' authority but to many people abuse her already
Baby face I'll pay your rent and no I'm not a player
But I'm here to assist

Another angel fly ass you don't exist
More than my friend you my boo you my sis
I can offer more than real hard decisions
When you feel the stroke you can resist it
Want to beat it like Rodney in 92'
Ain't nobody bad as you
Body banging like these NS10's in the studio

(Bridge)

Ain't no have you seen her kinda love
This that Martin-Gina Kinda love
Matching drop top beamer kinda love

See they just hating on us
All this money in God we trust
All this money in god we trust
All this money in god we trust
