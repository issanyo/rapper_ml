[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Never seen no one as bad as you
Got be cancelling all my cheques for you
Got me buying a crib in the valley for you
I might fuck with a [?], if it made for you
I would do anything
It's so major that you understand me
Know what it is, don't get it confused
Just look what I did, look what I did

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & ?]
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you girl
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you girl
Look what I did for you
Yeah look what I did for you girl
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you

[Verse 2: ?]
Look what I did for you
Can't forget what I did for you
I hear what you saying
But baby believe me, the feeling is mutual
I cook and I clean
And I fuck the shit outta you
I call up your mama
And take care of your baby too
What have you done to me baby?
You know what it is, don't get it confused
Just look what I did, look what I did for you

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & ?]
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you girl
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you girl
Look what I did for you
Yeah look what I did for you girl
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you

[Bridge: Kevin McCall]
Girl you know I'd really do anything for you
And I'll do all the crazy shit that he won't do
Just look what I do for you baby
The truth coming on me on some Janet Jackson
Talking 'bout what have you done for me lately

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & ?]
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you girl
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you girl
Look what I did for you
Yeah look what I did for you girl
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
Look what I did for you
