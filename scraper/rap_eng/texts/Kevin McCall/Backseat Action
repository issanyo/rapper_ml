She say she wanna go to bed with a winner
To bed with a winner, to bed with a winner
I know you see all of this bread, we can spend all
This bread, we can spend all
Girl, you fucking with a winner

Backseat action
Back of the rainbow where the magic happens
You see, I'm bringing whips, I'm smashing
Don't be surprised if you see your main bitch in traffic
Roll a shotgun, rolling my weed, it's a fat one
She said tell me, tell me, tell me, is it true love?
Bitch, I love you like a stepson
Bitches love me 'cause I'm handsome, never romancing
Guess I'm bringing on the dick
Wave around your wand, I've got it doing tricks
Shorty fucking with a winner, I'm the head chipping in
She say she wanna go to bed with a winner
To bed with a winner, to bed with a winner
I know you see all of this bread, we can spend all
This bread, we can spend all
Girl, you fuckiing with a winner
Backseat action, backseat action
Backseat action, jolly let me in and the whip I'm smashing
Backseat action, backseat action
Backseat action, jolly let me in and the whip I'm smashing
Finally got you in his backseat
Shorty say I'm running like it track me
Uh, you nasty, shorty like this dick from the backseat
Flexing, flexing, bitch, ' we get an erection
Balling, balling, balling like I'm DeSean Jackson
She say she wanna go to bed with a winner
To bed with a winner, to bed with a winner
I know you see all of this bread, we can spend all
This bread, we can spend all
Girl, you fucking with a winner
I don't ever lose, I don't ever lose
I be bagging bitches, bagging bitches all day
I don't ever lose, I don't ever lose
She gonna let me hit it, I go MIA
After I hit it, I go MIA
After I hit it, I go MIA
After I hit it, I go MIA
Let that bitch chose, I ain't got a speed game
She say she wanna go to bed with a winner
To bed with a winner, to bed with a winner
I know you see all of this bread, we can spend all
This bread, we can spend all
Girl, you fucking with a winner
Backseat action, backseat action
