Even if it's just a message (uhh) in the middle of the night
Sayin' "What you doing up this late?"
I can't sleep with you on my brain (no) It's more than physical with you
But I'd be lyin' if I didn't say I didn't wonna (wonna) taste of you (you)
I can tell that you want it too, ahh
Did you notice when I kissed you on your thigh that's when you opened up to me? (uhh)
And did you notice when I asked you who's it is that when you said my nickname?

She called me daddy

Shorty call me daddy
Cause I kiss her body right
Shorty call me daddy
The way I do it on fire
Let's just vibe, let's just vibe, let's just vibe out
Let's just ride
And if you want to get on top of me and ride out, go 'head

(repeat)
