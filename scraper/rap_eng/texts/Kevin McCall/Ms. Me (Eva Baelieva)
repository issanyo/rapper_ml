[Verse 1]
Heart holding on but my arms feel empty, empty
Put that on the road, we been in and out the city, city
Heard you got a new man, I guess he keep you hella busy
Cause you been screening all my calls and that's how I know you still miss me

[Chorus]
That's how I know you still miss me
That's how I know you still miss me
That's how I know you still miss me
Acting up and I know it's cause you miss me

[Verse 2]
Still can't forget 'bout the wild and crazy nights when you used to sex me
Damn, remember when we had conversation, now you barely would text me
Text me, me, damn
I miss you, you miss me, miss you too babe, hol' up
Either you holding my past against me or that new nigga flexing
But me and you got a history that separate me from your exes
Must be lost, let me help him find the X's
No drama, I'm too young to be restless
Broke your heart when I swore to protect it
Sorry if I come off too aggressive, so sorry, sorry
Know you miss me babe
Even if it's wishful thinking baby
You ain't gotta say, a blind man could see
I been counting O's, one thing's for sure, I really need you babe

[Chorus]
That's how I know you still miss me
That's how I know you still miss me
That's how I know you still miss me
Acting up and I know it's cause you miss me
That's how I know you still miss me
That's how I know you still miss me
That's how I know you still miss me
Acting up and I know it's cause you miss me
