[Intro: Chris Brown]
It's like I can't let you go (on tonight)
But I got to (on tonight)
I'ma change it up a little bit, I'm a do it like this

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
We don been together for a minute
Now it feels funny to be doing something different
But it's all good, me and you finished
She gotta ball player, but a nigga ain't tripping
And I ain't saying that he don't love you
But I don't think he love you like I do
But it's okay, it's alright
My blackberry filled with a whole bunch of women
Wasting time
Steady tryna get you back
Get you back in my life
Yeah you don't care, you don't care
It used to be you that I like but I'm a do what I like
Tonight, I'm gon' get tipsy
Over twenty one, all the girls have fun
And watch the ladies jump on me

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm not looking for love, 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turnt up
I ain't gon' think about you (na na na na)
(Aye aye aye) I ain't thinking about you tonight (na na na na)

[Verse 2: Bow Wow]
You got the wrong one, if you think I ain't gonna go out
You used to be the only girl a nigga would Think About
I gotta couple of girls on call, I'm a bring 'em out
A Magic City stripper huh, so this is what it's all about
I'm in the club doing my two-step
I done pulled about eight broads already
I'm just getting my feet wet (Damn)
But I ain't even knocking your style
See I be here all day tryna count how many girls want Bow
Yea I See You On The Blogs With Your Dude And All That
But little do you know, you making yourself look wack
If Dude Gotta Problem, Better Tell Him To Fall Back
I'm blowing real big in VIP, yeah that loud pack
Shit, it's me and Chris in here, so you know it's real thick in here
Better cuff your girl because your bitch in here
Tryna see how many I can fit in my Lambo
I never go raw, stay strapped like Rambo

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm not looking for love, 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turnt up
I ain't gon' think about you (na na na na)
(Aye aye aye) I ain't thinking about you tonight (na na na na)

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Shawty wassup
Oh baby
All the girls in the club (God damn, you sexy)
You sexy, God damn you sexy
Oh you sexy, ohhhhhh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I'm not looking for love, 'cause she's gone
So tell all the girls that the bottles on us
Get your drink on
I just wanna have a good time and keep you off my mind
Find a little shawty I like
Girl when I'm up in the club, really turnt up
I ain't gon' think about you (na na na na)
(Aye aye aye) I ain't thinking about you tonight (na na na na)
