[Hook]
Bae'Anna, bae'Anna
Bae'Anna, bae'Anna
Bae'Anna, bae'Anna
Take a one way, take a one way to come through

[Verse 1]
Girl, your first name must be Robin cause there's no fucks given
Spend the night with me on Saturday, mess around, you gon' turn into a Christian
Red bottoms in the air, your legs on my shoulders, hold the center
It's better than soul food, oh, I live for you
Ramen, I'mma eat it like it's soul food
Thank you for giving me some one to love
You was my religion
For me kissing, I'mma bless it
I'mma make love to you way too gentle
Just have you staring at my Tity Boi
You shine bright like a diamond when I stroke
Better hurry up and get a mouthful

[Hook]
Bae'Anna, bae'Anna
Bae'Anna, bae'Anna
Bae'Anna, bae'Anna
Take a one way, take a one way to come through

[Verse 2]
Put this on core if I could be below zero
I go deeper than Rihanna
If love was war, you should jump battleship
Oh bae, I hope you can swim
Bae'Anna, need a trill OG like your stories
Cause the way that you stole my heart
I see why they named you Robber
Cause you came from the Hood
Buy you a one way ticket to the CPT
DJ, I wanna touch and wine with Rihanna
