(Chorus):

It's some bitches in the house
It's some bitches in the house
It's some bitches in the
It's some, It's some
It's some bitches in the house
Hell yeah, Hell yeah
She can get it, She can get it
Hell yeah, Hell yeah
She can get it, She can get it

(Verse 1):

Yeah I got it girl, when I'm not on tour, and I'm kinda sure
You're a connoisseur, and that agent provocateur
I just wanna see you drop to the floor, do not disturb lock the door
What's yours is mine and what's mine is yours
Though when I perform this CPR on your body, all over your body
I'll kiss every inch of your body, just don't tell nobody
Nobody but you and me, gotta know bout what we do when we
Up in the dark in that hotel suite, sweet dreams ima put you to sleep

(Bridge):

I put that on the hood babe, ima give it to you good babe
And I put that on my hood, introduce you to some new things
Ima put a smile on your face, ("oh")

(Chorus): 2x

(Verse 2):

She say all she want is conversation, I said I rather read your body language
I can hear it calling, you stalling, trying to fight the feeling baby, you gon' feel amazing
When I put these lips on your clit and start licking baby, and make it wet like it's raining I got you dripping baby
That's called precipitation, you ain't been fucked right til' you fucked a nigga from the east side, It's K-Mac I'm 3 fly
We outta here peace sign ("dueces")

(Bridge):

I put that on the hood babe, ima give it to you good babe
And I put that on my hood, introduce you to some new things
Ima put a smile on your face, ("oh")

(Chorus): 2x

(Verse 3):

Baby let me see your ankles in the sky, baby let me see you wave 'em side to side
Wave 'em side to side, wave 'em side to side, put you face down while I hit it from behind
And do it one more time, run it back, run it back, rewind
Dance for me lady, so many sexy girls up in this club

(Bridge):

I put that on the hood babe, ima give it to you good babe
And I put that on my hood, introduce you to some new things
Ima put a smile on your face, ("oh")

(Dialogue):

" This that grown and sexy shit right here. You see a sexy lady, point her out right now and sing this with me. Tell her something real smooth like..."
( My love, do you, ever, dream of, hidden springs or waterfalls, cause I got your body dripping in my bed and it's soaked.)
