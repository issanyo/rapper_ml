[Verse 1: Major]
Stop looking at me like we finished
It ain't no stopping when we winning
Can't get around it, no pretending
Rack 'em up, stack 'em up, be with you in a minute now
Best believe me, I'mma kill it
All that I been through, can't forget it
Classic man from beginning
But I go hard like I'm on, don't get it twisted now

[Hook: Major]
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Gotta keep it on
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Keeping on
Can't nobody take my pride
Can't nobody hold me down
Oh no, gotta keep it moving
Nothing to it but to do it now
Why would I wanna waste my time?
Why would I wanna slow it down?
Oh no, yeah we gotta keep it moving
Nothing to it but to do it now
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Gotta keep it on
Yeah we gotta keep it moving
Nothing to it but to do it now

[Verse 2: Major]
Them jokers thinking that we sleeping
I keep 'em guessing, make believing
But why we at it, we gon' go high
We'll see who's laughing when I fly by
Heavy rain, we gon' get down
Deep pain, all the same, I ain't never scared
Still marching forward like a soldier
We in the finals, watch your man cross over

[Hook: Major]
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Gotta keep it on
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Keeping on
Can't nobody take my pride
Can't nobody hold me down
Oh no, gotta keep it moving
Nothing to it but to do it now
Why would I wanna waste my time?
Why would I wanna slow it down?
Oh no, yeah we gotta keep it moving
Nothing to it but to do it now
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Gotta keep it on
Yeah we gotta keep it moving
Nothing to it but to do it now

[Bridge: Major]

[Hook: Major]
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Gotta keep it on
Keep on keeping on, keeping on
Keeping on
