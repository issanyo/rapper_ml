[Verse 1]
You're a breath of fresh air, I need you without you I can't live
You're in cahoots with my heart, that's the way you stole it, it's gotta be a insider job
You're a diamond, short of perfect, but you're body still sparkles
I'm on a knee holding your left hand, I know where that missing diamond should

[Pre-Chorus]
Go ooh oh ooh oh oh oh
Is there a magical garden where more of you
Grow ooh oh ooh oh oh oh oh
I didn't think so

[Chorus]
Feel like I just won the lotto, I found a 1 in a million you, oh
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mould
There will never be another you, ooh
Never be another you, never be another you

[Verse 2]
Now I can spend my whole life, searching for something that's better than my dear
But that's a waste of my time, cause what’s better than perfect love? Nothing that’s what my point is
You can stand in front of the mirror and there wouldn't be a reflection
Cause there's only one you and that's why I never let you

[Pre-Chorus]
Go ooh oh ooh oh oh oh
Is there a magical garden where more of you
Grow ooh oh ooh oh oh oh oh
I didn't think so

[Chorus]
Feel like I just won the lotto, I found a 1 in a million you, oh
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mould
There will never be another you, ooh
Never be another you, never be another you

[Bridge]
I'm a firm believer in never say never
But I can say I'll never find another you
They can say what ever and it don't even matter
Cause I know our love is true
I'm a firm believer in never say never
But I can say I'll never find another you
They can say what ever and it don't even matter
Cause I know our love is true

[Chorus]
Felt like I just won the lotto, I found a 1 in a million you
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mould
There will never be another you
Never be another you, never be another you
Woah woah oh, woah woah oh, woah woah oh, woah woah oh, woah woah oh
There will never be another you
Woah woah oh, woah woah oh, woah woah oh, woah woah oh, woah woah oh
There will never be another you
