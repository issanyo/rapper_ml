[Intro: D&D]
D&D
Boing

[Verse 1: D&D]
I know this ain't a strip club but it's lookin' that way
Bottle lady, bring them fireworks my way
She pop it on a nigga and I love it
I could throw a stack at it, baby girl, I can touch it if you want it
I can make it, make it, make it nasty
Guaranteed ain't a lot of girls'll walk past me, past me, past me
Girl, you lookin' fancy
Drop top convertible, you know I'll be smashin' (right)

[Chorus: D&D]
W-W-What's Gucci? (Gucci, Gucci, Gucci)
That booty (booty, booty, booty)
Girl, turn around (what?)
That booty do somethin' to me, t-to me
W-W-W-What's Gucci? (Gucci, Gucci, Gucci)
T-T-That booty (booty, booty, booty)
Girl, turn around (what?)
That booty do somethin' to me, t-to me
Girl, I wanna see you dance
Twerk up and down, twerk up and down
Wanna see you dance
Twerk up and down, twerk up and down
When you pop it for a stack (stack, stack, stack, stack, stack)
Twerk up and down
When you pop it for a stack (stack, stack, stack, stack, stack)
Twerk up and down

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
P-P-P-Pop it for a stack, girl
You know what it is (yeah) r-racks on racks on racks, girl (oh)

So which one a y'all comin' back to the crib?
T-Throwin' money in your face, girl
I see you windin' up your waist, girl
If you didn't know, girl, you're fuckin' with a winner
C-Conversation with your ass, can I take it out to dinner? (What?)

[Chorus: D&D, Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]

Twerk up and down

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
I got a lot of hoes (yeah) I should water somethin' (yeah)
They give me super head, call 'em wonder women (ooh)
T-Throw it in reverse, better blow your back out, ballin'
Crib full of money, call it stack house
H-H-Hop in the Panamera and smash out (smash out)
Keep it poppin' it for me, I have you racked out (racked out)
Bitch see the crib and wanna move in
After I hit it and quit it, I throw that ass out (yup)
These niggas mad 'cause they need money
You wasn't robbed blind, you just never seen money
Louis belt cost a couple hunnid
She wanna fuck with me and Breezy so I told her run it, run it
D-D-Dime piece, she a dozen
If you married, I can hit it better than your husband (yup)
K-Mac (Mac) I know you heard of me (ma)
I'm throwin' hunnids with D&D, so I pop it for a stack

[Chorus: D&D]
Girl, I wanna see you dance
Twerk up and down, twerk up and down
Wanna see you dance
Twerk up and down, twerk up and down
When you pop it for a stack (stack, stack, stack, stack, stack)
Twerk up and down
When you pop it for a stack (stack, stack, stack, stack, stack)
Twerk up and down
Pop it for a stack
