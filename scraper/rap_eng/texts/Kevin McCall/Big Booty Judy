[Intro: DJ Drama]
We thinking like 36, 24, 40
That's about right

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Judy got a booty from here to there
Make a nigga smile from ear to ear
Order three more bottles of that Belvedere
Then I point it out like you come here
You come here and you come here
Booty sitting higher than a flight of stairs
Some can make it clap, some really can't know
Them Alabama girls said it's all in the ankles
Speaking of ankles bend over and touch your toes
Pop it and make it roll I'm loving this angle
Ha, I love this view that I'm looking at
Dress so elegant, ass like an elephant
Shorty got me hotter than I've ever been
So I'mma give it to like a motherfucking veteran
Body so sick so this dick be the medicine
And I don't know her name, she told me but all I heard was
(Clap Sound FX)

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy)
And the way she move her body is amazing (amazing)
Yeah, she got me going insane
And I don't even really know her name, I just call her
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy (aye)
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy (aye)
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy (aye)
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Now, now, now Judy is her name, I beat it out of frame
She not messing with no busters or no suckers cause they lame
She drop it low and sit it up, other niggas freezing up
Cause when they see that ass they like "Damn what you feeding her?"
Her, her, her body so ridiculous, I kiss it where she ticklish
Big booty world record, you can find it up in Guinness
And no, no, no it's not a gimmick, shawty she the truth
And she got a big donk (big donk), alley-oop
Damn girl I'm horny and you know I want it
Booty so big I can put ten bottles on it
I tell her hold this, she got baby making hips
So I pulled her pants down and gave her lingerie a kiss
Miss Parker, Miss Parker
When you go let me (oh), Miss Parker?
She whispered in my ear "Right now"
Then me, her, and her booty all smile

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy)
And the way she move her body is amazing (amazing)
Yeah, she got me going insane
And I don't even really know her name, I just call her
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy (aye)
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy (aye)
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy (aye)
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I know this cutie, her name is Judy
She's a yellow bone, big chick mega booty
Shawty got a donk, booty superpunk
And she keep it keep it shaking, like a bass in the trunk
Well six fifteens, his swag so mean
And I wanna know how she get up in them jeans
She gon' be my baby mama, she is all me
She's a bad bitch, greet her "Hello, Barbie"

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Yeah, she make the club go crazy (crazy)
And the way she move her body is amazing (amazing)
Yeah, she got me going insane
And I don't even really know her name, I just call her
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy (aye)
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy (aye)
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy (aye)
Big booty Judy (aye), big booty Judy
