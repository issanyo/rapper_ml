(Intro)
This the type of shit that make ya...
This the type of shit that make ya...
This the type of shit that make ya clothes fall off
Clothes fall off, fall...

(Verse 1)
Girl i'm speeding in my rover
'cause im rushing to come over
'cause I need it right now but
I ain't trying to wake your home girl up
Oh, since you say she ain't home
We can get it poppin', we can get it on
We can do it 'til it's early in the morning
Make you come over and over and over again, yeah

(Hook)
Don't it feel good girl?
When I give it to you good girl
I'm in your neighborhood girl
So be expecting company, yeah

(Chorus)
Guess who's coming over
Girl I got a lil something somthing to show ya
Girl I hope you ready, for what, im about to do to you, yeah
So guess who's coming over
Girl I got a couple freaky things to show ya
Girl i'm trying to get up, all up, in ya
Oooohh I hope your home alone

(Verse 2)
Is anybody home? I hope your all alone girl
If I have you all to myself...
Soon as I show up, imma snatch off all your clothes and imma tear you up
Have you screaming so loud we wake the neighbors up
All over the house, girl it's going down
Let me take you upstairs to your bedroom, right now oooooohh
Baby hold it steady for me, and let me love you deeper, yeah

(Hook)
Don't it feel good girl?
When I give it to you good girl
I'm in your neighborhood girl
So be expecting company, yeah

(Chorus)
Guess who's coming over
Girl I got a lil something somthing to show ya
Girl I hope you ready, for what, im about to do to you, yeah
So guess who's coming over
Girl I got a couple freaky things to show ya
Girl i'm trying to get up, all up, in ya
Oooohh I hope your home alone

(Bridge)
So many freaky things I want to do to you
And your body baby
We can start off in the kitchen on the counter babe
Let me taste ya
Imma make you beg for more
And make you come harder than before
Girl I'm at your door, I hope your all alone

(Chorus)
Guess who's coming over
Girl I got a lil something somthing to show ya
Girl I hope you ready, for what, im about to do to you, yeah
So guess who's coming over
Girl I got a couple freaky things to show ya
Girl i'm trying to get up, all up, in ya
Oooohh I hope your home alone

(outro)
This the type of shit that make ya...
This the type of shit that make ya...
This the type of shit that make ya clothes fall off
Clothes fall off, fall...
