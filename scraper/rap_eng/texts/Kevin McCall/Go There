[Verse 1]
It ain't like you're always alone
And even when you are, I make sure you're comfortable
And I hold you when you need it
But I can't do it every single time but I try

[Pre-Chorus]
See I don't want you to take me but
I ain't begging you to stay no more
Cause I know you'll never find another lover like this
And that you want the key to my crib
Ain't that you rolling round in my bed?
It is, woah, that's my shit

[Chorus]
You can't keep going back and forth saying it's over
You say you this close to leaving but you're so damn far
Oh yeah, you should make up your mind and stick to it
If you wanna go there, go there

[Verse 2]
All of us have something to lose
But I bet I'll find another one just like you
And I ain't saying that I'm perfect
But you're the one tryna give up on us
If you don't get it, let me break it down

[Pre-Chorus]
See I don't want you to take me but
I ain't begging you to stay no more
Cause I know you'll never find another lover like this
And that you want the key to my crib
Ain't that you rolling round in my bed?
It is, woah, that's my shit

[Chorus]
You can't keep going back and forth saying it's over
You say you this close to leaving but you're so damn far
Oh yeah, you should make up your mind and stick to it
If you wanna go there, go there

[Bridge]
I should be used to you tripping
But I'm sick and tired of fussing and fighting
I ain't stopping you tonight
I ain't fucking with you tonight

[Chorus]
You can't keep going back and forth saying it's over
You say you this close to leaving but you're so damn far
Oh yeah, you should make up your mind and stick to it
If you wanna go there, go there
