(Hook)
It could all be simple
But we make it so hard
Find that true lover...lover
Gotta find that one lover...lover
It could all be simple
If heartbreak was painless
Gotta fight for one another...another
Not fuck with eachother...eachother

(Verse 1)
If beauties in the eyes of the beholder
You're reflection must be in the eyes of jehovah
Your bodies so c-c-cold you gon' catch pneumonia
Cause it's a cold world and heartbreak is even colder
If you ever truly felt love, you don't believe in fairy-tale love
If you believe in the dream you should sell one
To all the broken hearts that's tryna rebuild love
Wish they could feel love, I'm talkin' real love (real love)

(Hook)
It could all be simple
But we make it so hard
Find that true lover...lover
Gotta find that one lover...lover

(Verse 2)
Look, look I see shorties who never had they father
Always lookin' for love and always comin' up with nada
So as soon as a random nigga come up and holla
She fall in love and find herself in another problem, damn
Oh well that's the tale of heart so frail
Now she crying in the lobby heartbreak hotel
Love is real but it sucks for beginners
We all lost love, so tell me who's the winners?
Two fourteen is the day that she remember
That's the day her warm heart turned colder than december
That's the type of shit that turn a saint to a sinner
If love conquers all fuck it, I surrender...but remember

(Hook)
It could all be simple
But we make it so hard
Find that true lover...lover
Gotta find that one lover...lover

(Bridge)
Even with all your imperfections
You're beautiful to me
I love your flaws cause that's what makes you
So beautiful to me...to me and it could be...

(Hook)
It could all be simple
If heartbreak was painless
Gotta fight for one another...another
Not fuck with eachother...eachother
