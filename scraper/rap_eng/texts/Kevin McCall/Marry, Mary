[Verse 1]
Numbers 1 to 5, so turn off the lights
With these songs, me and you can make love all night
Love over lust, faith over truth, I see that true love is blind
Just one time, see me with your heart and not with your eyes
Oh pretty baby, I'm the king, you're the queen
Living this like an American dream
Prince of king, you're my Lisa
No Breezy baby, but you're Royalty
True [?] to love and loyalty
Instead of half of it, you get all of me
My homies a thong, hitting you a one
So you never alone
Running sumo like I'm African
Let you come first, I pass you the baton
You make a blind man wanna see light again
Ain't got no time for no shade
So fine, even Miles Rock wanna hit it, no shade
You wear the crown baby like you ill and fitted, yeah

[Hook]
Searching for my future queen
I'mma marry Mary
Kevin's jeweler, diamond rings
I'mma marry Mary
Let's go half on a baby
Wish I could make one with you now
Cause you're my ride or die
Go 'head and ride

[Verse 2]
I got a APB out on my own family
I don't even get to see my baby girl andshe live in Cali
They still treating me like a east side nigga when I move way to the valley
Ain't personal cause I know they don't really know shit about me
Even though they talk shit 'bout me, even though all the blogs writing 'bout me
But thank God for Sunday cause Lord, that's where you found me
I would say if I throw it to you but too many people abusing already
Steady face, I pay your rent and no, I'm not a player but I met her at 6
Another angle fly, I shoot on you bitch
More than my friend, you my boo, you my set
I could offer you more than the, hard decisions
When you feeling strong, you can't resist
Wanna beat it like Rodney in '92
Ain't nobody bad as you
Body banging like these NS10's in the studio
Ain't no have you seen that kinda love
That Martin/Gina kinda love
Matching droptop/Beemer kinda love
See they just hating on us
All this money, in God we trust
All this money, in God we trust
All this money, in God we trust

[Hook]
For my future queen
I'mma marry Mary
Kevin's jeweler, diamond rings
I'mma marry Mary
Let's go half on a baby
Wish I could make one with you now
Cause you're my ride or die
Go 'head and ride
Kevin's jeweler, diamond rings
I'mma marry Mary
Let's go half on a baby
Wish I could make one with you now
Cause you're my ride or die
Go 'head and ride
