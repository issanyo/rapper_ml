[Verse 1]
I know everybody on this planet wished that they had you
I feel so blessed, baby, it's an honour that I got you
I know every man, probably told you that he loved you
This ain't no ordinary love song, no, this ain't no ordinary love song

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'ma say it in the stadium
Scream it like an anthem, say it from the mountain top
Sing it like you favourite song
I'ma put my cards on the table for you

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
And baby, there's nothing in the world that I won't do for you
Oh, I love you
I gotta tell you 'bout a million, trillion times, baby, you're the best thing in my life

[Verse 2]
Put your hand on my heart, can't you feel that boom, boom, boom?
Only one reason that it beats is for you
In this love game, baby, I play the fool
This is no ordinary love song, no this ain't no ordinary love song

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'ma say it in the stadium
Scream it like an anthem, say it from the mountain top
Sing it like you favourite song
I'ma put my cards on the table for you

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
And baby, there's nothing in the world that I won't do for you
Oh, I love you
I gotta tell you 'bout a million, trillion times, baby, you're the best thing in my life

[Bridge]
For once in my life, once in my life
I can see clear 'cause you open my eyes
For once in my life, once in my life
No doubt in my mind, you're the only one for me, baby, can't you see? Oh, I'm so oh

[Chorus]
'Cause I love you
And baby, there's nothing in the world that I won't do for you
Oh, I love you
I gotta tell you 'bout a million, trillion times, baby, you're the best thing in my life
