[Intro: Kevin McCall]
Keke, you know I got you, right?
And before I let you sing to 'em with that pretty voice of yours
Let me clear something up
K Mac, look
Your mama said, "what?"
Your sister said, "who?"
C'mon you see what they're tryna do
It's impossible, but they still on a mission to break up a happy home
Like demolition, don't even listen

[Verse 1: Keke Palmer]
So baby, tell me
You don't care what they saying
Boy, you know me
So they can just keep on hating
We're the only ones in this love
No one can take this away from us

[Pre-Chorus 1: Keke Palmer]
And I know we got the real thing
Cause I feel it when you hold me, yeah
So, I wanna know...

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
What do they know 'bout love?
What do they, what do they know 'bout us?
And as much as they bring me up
The only thing that they know is I got you
Baby, I got you, and you got me

[Verse 2: Keke Palmer]
So baby, tell me
Why they wanna mess this thing up?
Maybe they be hating cause they wish they was us
They can't get between this love
No one can take this away from us

[Pre-Chorus 2: Keke Palmer]
And I know we got the real thing
Can you feel it when you hold me, yeah?
So, I wanna know...

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
What do they know 'bout love?
What do they, what do they know 'bout us?
And as much as they bring me up
The only thing that they know is I got you
Baby, I got you, and you got me

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
First I greet you with a kiss on the lips
No special occasion, but your presence's a gift
They tryna sink our relationship
But we cruising on a coast to Costa Rica, so don't trip
I fall in love with something new about you everyday
It ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
You got me singing, like I'm Marvin Gaye
Tyrese, with a chorus of Sweet Lady
Uh, match made in heaven
Lucky that I found you, I must of roll a seven or eleven
One, four, three
I got you, and you got me

[Chorus: Keke Palmer]
What do they know 'bout love?
What do they, what do they know 'bout us?
And as much as they bring me up
The only thing that they know is I got you
Baby, I got you, and you got me
