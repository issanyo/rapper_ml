[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Go 'head, do ya dance
I know you see all of this money in my hand
And if you keep doing it for me I'mma spend it all
Girl if you keep doing it for me I'mma spend it all

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Just got my check I'm 'bout to spend it on the whole club
Half of these niggas can't pay rent after it's over
Two chicks me, hit bipolar
Jamaican-Indian chicks they totem pole up
The way you move your body girl
Make me wanna feel your body girl
Girl I know you want it, ain't no change for all these hundreds
I'm about to make it rain, they should change your name to stormy
Girl you know my dick's enormous, girl I love your performance
She said she was from New Orleans, tryna sting her like a hornet
Upgrade her, that's a bonus
Her booty that's what I'm boning

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Go 'head, do ya dance
I know you see all of this money in my hand
And if you keep doing it for me I'mma spend it all
Girl if you keep doing it for me I'mma spend it all
It's alright, it's okay
Girl just keep popping that booty in my face
And if you keep popping that booty I'mma spend it all
Girl if you keep popping that booty I'mma spend it all

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Ha, yeah, leggo, my eyes shut cause her booty all in my face
I touch, no computer she in MySpace
Damn look at mami lose it watch her gyrate
Breezy up in this bitch like a vibrator
VIP with two of them
Got two cheeks use your booty for the ATM
Credit cards, take off your bra have a m√©nage
Particular, vehicular, call me the sarge'
Grown booty from the A-Town
Pull her hair, can't see nothing from the waist down
For them dollars make her holler like "whoa"
And my transactions got them Jacksons, Michael
Ha, you corny rappers can't be serious
Cause deep down we know you pussy, period
Ha, so now it's back to getting more hoes
You niggas lack delivery, Digiorno

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Go 'head, do ya dance
I know you see all of this money in my hand
And if you keep doing it for me I'mma spend it all
Girl if you keep doing it for me I'mma spend it all
It's alright, it's okay
Girl just keep popping that booty in my face
And if you keep popping that booty I'mma spend it all
Girl if you keep popping that booty I'mma spend it all

[Bridge: Sevyn]
I'm feeling myself, done had a couple drinks, I start to feeling myself
I start to dance up on ya, feeling under your belt
I need a tipper
When I'm dancing you can put the money on my thighs
Just watch me get low but I'mma need a little more if I'mma take it all off
Need you to dig in your pockets, deeper
You say you a wiling nigga
Then put your money where your mouth is

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Sevyn]
Go 'head, do ya dance
I know you see all of this money in my hand
And if you keep doing it for me I'mma spend it all
Girl if you keep doing it for me I'mma spend it all
It's alright, it's okay
Girl just keep popping that booty in my face
And if you keep popping that booty I'mma spend it all
Girl if you keep popping that booty I'mma spend it all
