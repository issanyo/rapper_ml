[Intro: Chris Brown]
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral
I just got hit by a bus
Shouldn't have been so beautiful
Don't know why I gave my heart
Gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different
Make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance
But I keep making the same mistakes before I
I see the danger but I go forward
I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone, I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

[Verse 1: Diddy, Chris Brown & Both]
Uh, give my all, you take it from me (From me, girl)
And don't even replace it for me (No)
I wish you'd just fake it for me (Fake it)
I wish I can make you love me more
You can't tell I fucks with you
I needed you
I thought that you understood that
Based on how I treated you
I don't pay attention to the rumors that you feed into
Know you're missin' somethin'
I wish I was what completed you (Damn, da-da, damn, damn)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Yesterday I fell in love
Today feels like my funeral (Yeah)
I just got hit by a bus (Bus)
Shouldn't have been so beautiful (Yeah, no)
Don't know why I gave my heart
Gave my trust, gave everything
You think that if I had the chance
To do it over again
I'd do something different (Yeah)
Make better decisions
Save me from my ignorance (Yes)
But I keep making the same mistakes before I (Ooh)
I see the danger but I go forward (Woah, woah, woah)
I'm sitting here trying to keep my composure (Oh)
Knowing inside I'm broken and tore up
She got me gone, I'm on her like a drug
I try to go but end up wanting more
Stuck in my head vivid as a picture
I wanna be clean but I can't get rid of her

[Verse 2: Diddy, Chris Brown & Both]
Uh, I feel like a killer hit me (Hit me)
The weapon was concealed initially (Oh, oh)
But I felt so much pain from it (Pain)
You deserved to feel it with me more
I feel like I beg with you, I plead with you
I don't comprehend how you can't love
When it's so easy to
I thought you could do it
I believed in the naive in you (Oh, oh)
I just need to breathe, baby (Oh, no)
Now I got the freedom to

[Outro: Chris Brown]
She's like a drug, yeah
And I don't think I can get rid of her (I can't get rid of her)
'Cause she got me in this curse (Yeah)
And then it dawned on me
I can't do nothing with her
This woman's worth (Yeah, no, oh)
I can't find my way out and it hurts
I tried but she won't let me go
She won't let me go
She wonâ€™t let me go
She won't let me go, oh
She won't let me go
She won't let me go
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Woah, oh, yeah
Yeah
