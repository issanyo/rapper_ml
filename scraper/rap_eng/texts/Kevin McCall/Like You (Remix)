[Verse 1: Tyga]
Girl, trench coat, black thighs
Hammer back, shoot it in the sky
I live by you my bride, load you up, it's hammer time
Hell yeah, I'm handle mine, but that's just just just just for one night
I'ma love you right, you protect my life
She can try to play you, but they gon' pay the price
A-A-Alfalfa on these hoes, standin' up at all times
No lie, just remember you forever mine (uh)

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Shawty, I ain't never met a freak like you, no shawty
I'm something like an addict for the things you do, do, oh oh oh
Oh, with you, oh, you drive me crazy, oh, things you do, yeah, yeah
Oh, I want you, oh, to be my lady, with you, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Parlay Starr & (Kevin McCall)]
Yeah, she's on like Donkey Kong
She got her body like a model showin' off her thong
She wanna put it in the mouth because she know that I'm a gangsta
On the streets, I'm a beast and she know I'm strong
But the paper long, I gotta cash it in
She just wanna be my homie, lover, friend
But I'ma set it off, pass her off
By the Hollywood sign, good kush, Ros√© and all
I got a super jaw with designer look
I call her Pocahontas, fresh up out the Playboy book
She like scream and squirt, I think she like when it hurt
And put it deep in the beach and she flow to the flow
Now she beggin' for more, she wanna touch the sky
G6, she's gifted, mile high
I'm so uplifted, creamy thighs
Appeal to me chill, well just take a dive
When I'm on the road, baby, slide me up
On my laptop posted on my tour bus
She don't give a what, she just play with us
She find out herself who brings the stuff
Just to give it up, that's the one for me
So I'ma keep her around just to strip for me (K-Mac)
She's the MVP, I'm talkin' 'bout the greatest
Take the last shot, just to keep big party free (brap)

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Look, this ain't R. Kelly song, we gon' skip the 12 Play (yeah)
Girl, I'm on that Usher shit, we gon' do this my way (yeah)
I play no games, go hard, no shame (yeah, yeah)
Girl, I'm like an animal, uncaged, untame
T-Pain, say he was in love with a stripper
Now I see what he was sayin', it's like heaven when I'm with her
She ain't no beginner though, this one's a professional
Even from the back seat, she could drive a manual
Freaky conversations when I whisper in her ear lobe (ah, ah, ah)
Now we hot and sweaty, condensation on my windows (ah, ah, ah)
I make the car sweat, she got my seats wet
She whisper to me like, "Can we keep this secret?"

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Shawty, I ain't never met a freak like you, no shawty
I'm something like an addict for the things you do, do, oh oh oh
Oh, with you, oh, you drive me crazy, oh, things you do, yeah, yeah
Oh, I want you, oh, to be my lady, with you, yeah, yeah
