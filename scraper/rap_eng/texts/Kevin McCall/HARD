[Chorus]
You must be tryna fall in love
Tryna fall, tryna fall hard
Go so deep in love
You must be tryna fall, tryna fall hard
I know I get it so hard
Oh, why you make it so hard?
Once she get a kiss, she gon' wanna get
Tryna hold back but you make it so
You must be tryna fall hard hard

[Verse 1]
Damn right, I must be tryna fall in LOVE
Tonight and I know that you're excited to see me
Girl, I can talk 'bout what you said
You want me to lay it on down
I hit your line and you hit me right back
Name another nigga that you fuck with like that
Eat it on the counter and I hit it for an hour
I know you want it bad, this I do
I know you wanna feel me deep inside of you

[Chorus]
You must be tryna fall in love
Tryna fall, tryna fall hard
Go so deep in love
You must be tryna fall, tryna fall hard
I know I get it so hard
Oh, why you make it so hard?
Once she get a kiss, she gon' wanna get
Tryna hold back but you make it so
You must be tryna fall hard hard
