[Verse 1]
Can't explain, this feeling is so familiar
Oh, I wonder if, I wonder if heaven can hear us
Wish I could stay, stay until the end of the world
So tell the DJ play us something that lasts forever, oh yeah

[Chorus]
Heaven above, I need a miracle tonight
Send me someone to bring this body back to life
Just let me know what I gotta sacrifise
For the DJ to send me the love
Send me the love
DJ save us tonight
DJ save us tonight
DJ save us tonight

[Verse 2]
Just when you thought
Just when you thought this night was over
I heard a voice, I could've sworn it came from somewhere up above
DJ, it was a DJ, yeah
It said "I'ma keep this party going all damn night for y'all"

[Chorus]
Woohoo, wow, wow, wow
I'ma keep this party going all damn night for y'all
Woohoo, wow, wow, wow
I'ma keep this party going all damn
A-a-all damn night, a-a-all damn night, a-a-all damn night
A-a-all damn, all-all-all-all damn night
A-a-all damn night, a-a-all damn night
I'ma keep this party going all damn night for y'all

[Chorus]
Heaven above, I need a miracle tonight
Send me someone to bring this body back to life
Just let me know what I gotta sacrifise
For the DJ to send me the love
Send me the love
DJ save us tonight
DJ save us tonight
DJ save us tonight
