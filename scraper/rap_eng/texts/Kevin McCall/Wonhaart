[Skit: Kevin McCall and his daughter]
Daddy, please teach me about Valentine's Day
Of course, baby. See, Valentine's Day is just a holiday where you show the people you love how much you love 'em, but a gentleman show that everyday
Daddy, do you love my mommy?
Of course I love your mommy, you look just like her, baby
Ewww... Gross, you're the worst man
Heh, I know, baby, but that's real love
Will you be my Valetine?
Every single day, baby

[Hook: Kevin McCall]
Only got one heart
So many girls I love
Can't make my mind
This time can take me time but I
Can't keep falling in love
With all of y'all
Keep falling in love
With all of y'all
Keep falling in love
With all of y'all
But if I could, I would
Make you all mine

[Verse: Kevin McCall]
So many beautiful girls everywhere I go
[?] romantic
'Cause I'll never let them go
Yeah I don't see nothing wrong
'Cause there's plenty love to throw around

Only got one heart
So many girls I love
Can't make my mind
This time can take me time but I
Can't keep falling in love
With all of y'all
Keep falling in love
With all of y'all
Keep falling in love
With all of y'all
But if I could, I would
Make you all mine
