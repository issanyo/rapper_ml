Picture you and me on a private beach
Black sand on our feet, you’re clear water
Girl, I’m going under
Don’t you take your eyes off me
I’ll be diving in your deep blue sea

Gotta take a private jet to this private party
Me and you on a private island
Only guy, home for two, that’s ok ’cause you’re invited
That dress you’re wearing is so enticing
Looking so good make me wanna bite it
Only feel Michael Tyson

Girl, you make me wanna travel your body, body
Make me wanna go deep see diving, diving
I ain’t coming up, no, I ain’t coming up
Till I make you burst, till I get your hair fucked up
I can’t let you leave till I make you come

Picture you and me on a private beach
Black sand on our feet, you’re clear water
Girl, I’m going under
Don’t you take your eyes off me
I’ll be diving in your deep blue sea

This water is kicking in
I’mma take you outta here
Let’s go short of slow
‘Cause I know you wanna dance
Baby, I’m diving in
I’mma let your love wash me

Picture you and me on a private beach
Black sand on our feet, you’re clear water
Girl, I’m going under
Don’t you take your eyes off me
I’ll be diving in your deep blue sea

Picture you and me on a private beach
Black sand on our feet, you’re clear water
Girl, I’m going under
Don’t you take your eyes off me
I’ll be diving in your deep blue sea
