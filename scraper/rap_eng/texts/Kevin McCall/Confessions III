[Chorus]
Down there where the water fresher
That's when I thought I was moving on
My baby mama's gone
Now she got a brand new bae
It broke my heart
Tryna act like none don't phase
Really crushed my heart
Knowing that it's Monday

[Verse 1]
Way you keep missing my calls you should've kept my last name
Lost our house then you walked out, then they repossessed the Range
Sunshine or cloudy skies with a chance of rain
Now you're singing that song by Miss Anderson
I know you heard it all before
Fortunate to have you girl, I really adore you
You, this time I'll tell you my confessions, 'fessions
Confessions 1 plus 2
Confessions 1 plus 2

[Verse 2]
Every time she be in LA
Shawty hit the club with her girlfriends
I remember back when I was with her
She didn't have no time for her girlfriends
Way before twerking for a Birkin
I was all about the bizz
Game tighter than a virgin
Even if she born again
Let's go back, show you how it all began
Staples Center going wild like I'm balling
Damn, you was my groovy baby
I was your superstar
True Carter, Carter
Now she serving me papers
Seems like yesterday we used to roll those up
Roll up the Buddha

[Chorus]
Down there where the water fresher
That's when I thought I was moving on
My baby mama's gone
Now she got a brand new bae
It broke my heart
Tryna act like none don't phase
Really crushed my heart
Knowing that it's Monday

[Outro]
Every time she be in LA
Shawty hit the club with her girlfriends
I remember back when I was with her
She didn't have no time for her girlfriends
I was all about the bizz
Game tighter than a virgin
Even if she born again
Even if she born again
Even if she born again
