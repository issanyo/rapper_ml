[Intro]
Bout that life
Bout that life
Bout that life

[Verse 1]
VIP, bottle-poppin' in the club, turning up
I'm gonna party all night; I'mma live it up
Let me do my thing 'til I had enough
I can never have enough

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm gonna tip them girls
Yeah, I'm gonna take the shots
Pour it up; roll it up
I don't think I'll ever stop

Because I love this shit
And this shit love me back
Yo' nigga fuck with me the long way
He lonely; he ain't comin' back

[Chorus]
You ain't really bout that life
He want a real one, a real one
That's bout that life
I said, boy, you're playin'
He said, I'm just sayin'

And I laugh it off like where the blunt
Where the blunt? Where the blunt go?
Break it down, roll it up, then I smoke some more
Where the blunt? Where the blunt? Where the blunt go?
Break it down, roll it up, then I smoke some more

[Verse 2]
2-0-1, he hit my line, say he wanna spend some time
Say he wanna cruise; we could do whatever I like
Well, let me do my thing; let's go out tonight
Baby, let's go out tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm gonna tip them girls
Yeah, I'm gonna take the shots
Pour it up; roll it up
I don't think I'll ever stop

Because I love this shit
Goddamnit, I love this shit
Yo' nigga fuck with me the long way
He lonely; he ain't comin' back

[Chorus]
He say you ain't really bout that life
He want a real one, a real one
That's bout that life
I said, boy, you're playin'
He said, I'm just sayin'

And I ask him like where the blunt
Where the blunt? Where the blunt go?
Break it down, roll it up, then I smoke some more
Where the blunt? Where the blunt? Where the blunt go?
Break it down, roll it up, then I smoke some more

[Refrain]
You ain't really bout that life
He want a real one, a real one
That's bout that life
I said, boy, you're playin'
He said, I'm just sayin'

And I laugh it off like where the blunt
Where the blunt? Where the blunt go?
Break it down, roll it up, then I smoke some more
Where the blunt? Where the blunt? Where the blunt go?
Break it down, roll it up, then I smoke some more

[Outro]
I tell you like where the blunt
Where the blunt? Where the blunt go?
Break it down, roll it up, then I smoke some more
Where the blunt? Where the blunt? Where the blunt go?
Break it down, roll it up, then I smoke some more, yeah
