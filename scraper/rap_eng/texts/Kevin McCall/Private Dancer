[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Yeah I would like this dance little mama
I thought you’d never ask, I got lot of cash
Especially more for ya yeah
‘Cause you’re the hottest thing up in this club
I can tell when you hit the stage, baby you getting paid
Your booty is like a money magnet
You looking like Jessica Rabbit
Putting these other chicks in the casket yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Here go a G stack, come sit on my lap
Now let me tell you what I'm here for
I'm looking to fill this position
And baby, girl you fit the description, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Private dancer, my private dancer
Said you gon' be my private dancer
Just pack your things up
Cause you coming home with me tonight
Private dancer, my private dancer

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I can quadruple what you making
I'll make your job description so clear
You ain't got to worry about your boss
I already paid him off my dear
See I got a mansion in the Hamptons
And a club in the back bartender and a chef, what else do you really need?
It's your show but anything goes
You ain't got to worry, you can lose control

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Here go a G stack, come sit on my lap
Now let me tell you what I'm here for
I'm looking to fill this position
And baby, girl you fit the description, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Private dancer, my private dancer
Said you gon' be my private dancer

Cause you coming home with me tonight
Private dancer, my private dancer
You gon' be my private dancer
Just pack your things up
Cause you coming home with me tonight

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
I be, I be in the strip club with my hands up
Tricking like I'm flipping I be spending all my ends up
Even if I never leave my seat she make me stand up
See that's why I could never move to Atlanta
All about her butt she would me think she came from Tampa
She stay on that new shit, no wonder why she paying for it
Get it she gon', she gon' let me hit it

We can take this to my crib, got a stripper pole up in it
Girl girl you know I love it when you pop that shit for pimping

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
