[Verse 1: Mila J]
You had me crying like a baby
You used to fuck me all night
You had it crying like a baby
You used to kiss it just right
Back and forth, left and right
In and out, side to side
Ain't that what it's all about right?
Night and day, day and night
Oh these 4 walls of mine
Ain't the same without you inside

[Bridge: Mila J]
Don't tell me that we're insane
Boy we had a good thing
Dunno how we both let it fall apart
Now we're driving in the wrong lane
Love is not a one way
Rear view mirror broken like shattered hearts

[Verse 2: Mila J]
Oh, I used to rock it on you
Rock it on you, rock it on you
Rock, rock it on you
You used to let me, rock you so steady
Think about all the things that we used to do
Wondering if you'll find you another lover, it's true

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
It ain't over 'til it's over
This shit ain't over 'til it's over
Boy tell me I like when we roll up
My love is deeper than the ocean for you

[Verse 4: Kevin McCall & Mila J]
Mind get to racing when I'm thinking about it
Heart get to racing when I'm thinking about it
Oh get this way when I'm thinking about it
Oh I can't live without, can't live without this
Need your surfboard cause I'm drowning
Missing the way you used to drown it
And I can't live, can't live
No I can't live, can't live

[Bridge: Mila J]
Don't tell me that we're insane
Boy we had a good thing
Dunno how we both let it fall apart
Now we're driving in the wrong lane
Love is not a one way
Rear view mirror broken like shattered hearts

[Verse 5: Kevin McCall]
I stay out, I stay, yes I stay waiting I like the grounding
I love the strong, strong like that bomb I puff the loudest
Back and forth, back and forth like a lever in the 90s
In the 90s
When I'm in this rocking chair it reminds me
I need you in this bed, loving you round me
Crazy thoughts in my head, you got me
Right where you want me, want me
Right where you want me, want me
Right where you want me
