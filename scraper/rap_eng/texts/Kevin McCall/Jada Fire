[Verse 1: Kevin McCall & (Sammie)]
K-Mac, look, look, this ain't a game, but I'm a player
In the club with my main, but I'm still a player (uh-huh)
Pick the baddest chick, told her hit me later (yeah, yeah)
If she got the fire? I'ma call her Jada (yeah, ayy)
Kush got me higher then the Himalayas (uh-huh)
Mami popping that P like the perculator (oh, oh, oh)
They all in my VIP, so it's plenty haters (oh, woah)
Tryna fake it 'til they make it call it perpetrator (ooh, woah)
Shawty hot, shawty smoking
I got her wet, it's like I'm super soaked (wet, super soaked)
Throw it back so I could bust it open (ayy)
Louis Armstrong, her cheek's swollen (ayy, ayy, woah)
Let me jump up and down on that pretty, pretty (pretty, pretty)
I'ma leave a frown on that pretty, pretty (pretty, pretty)
Tattoo on the cat say come and get me
Tattoo on my dick say hello kitty (hello kitty)

[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
She going hard, she ain't tired (nope)
Pop a pill, pull all night
Shawty wet, I'ma need a dryer

She got that Jada fire, fire, fire, fire fire fire fire
She got that Jada fire, fire, fire, fire fire fire fire
Ooh, she got that, ooh she got that

She got the fire that good, good shit (oh, oh)

Bitch hurt, get me a new chick (ooh)
Now I'm tryna picture her fucking another bitch (yeah)
Make it rain, she got that super soak (oh, oh)
From the ceiling to the wall, bring a raincoat (oh)

Gently down the stream, row row your boat
Look at her move, shawty get it in

So I'ma play it cool 'cause she turn me on
She got the Jada fire, turn the cameras on (ooh, ooh)

Ooh, she got that, ooh she got that
