Real sex (3x)
Schoolin' session, let me turn this room into a campus
I don't need parental permission to take advantage
Of your body, you's a hottie
Go on, work yo magic
Make my problem disappear 'n call that theramathematics
I'm a addict, fienin' for love, a hopeless romantic
Imagine me divin' deep in your ocean, like the Atlantic
Your body so cold, you're sinkin' my Titanic
Kiss you below your zero, goin' in like a savage

[Bridge]
