[Intro]
Let me take you higher baby
Let me take you higher baby (yeah)

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
I think it's going down, down, down, down, down
I think I want you now, now, now, now
Booty round, swisher brown
The kind you wanna smoke for a day
I'm addicted, so let me hit it
Coming through to get a taste

[Chorus]
Girl I'ma take you high, high, high
Higher than you've ever been
Take your body for a ride (high, high)
Higher than you've ever been (high)
Just one hit'll get you right
And I ain't even playing
When I tell you jump, you say how high, high
Higher than you've ever been

[Verse 2: Tank]
Cocaine, I'll have you smuggling eight keys a night
Oh it ain't the same (no, no, no)
Baby you gonn chase this high for life
I got your supply, I'm your pusher
I'm one hitter quitter killer, that brown sugar
You can try to leave me, you gon realize that you need me Sweating, shaking on the floor

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Tank]
Girl I'ma take you high, high, high
Higher than you've ever been
Take your body for a ride (high, high)
Higher than you've ever been (high)
Just one hit'll get you right
And I ain't even playing
When I tell you jump, you say how high, high
Higher than you've ever been

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Put your pretty lips on it and don't be shy
I'ma hit it more than a couple times
Promise I'ma blow your mind
Break it down, spread it out
And roll another one for later, later
One hit of that oowee got me woozy baby
Girl you know that booty lookin crazy

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Tank]
Girl I'ma take you high, high, high
Higher than you've ever been
Take your body for a ride (high, high)
Higher than you've ever been (high)
Just one hit'll get you right
And I ain't even playing
When I tell you jump, you say how high, high
Higher than you've ever been
