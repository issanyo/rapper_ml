[Intro:]
I'm looking for a sexy girl to dance for me
Can you be that sexy girl? Dance for me

[Verse 1:]
She said she wanna see the money
Kev show me the money
Take it off, take it off
I know you look better in that birthday suit
You don't need no lingerie on
Just some booze and I'm about to nut it off
We don't need no lights on
Baby I just wanna see you
Drop it low on this love
Girl will you do that
I'm about to spend it all on you tonight
I wanna see your

[Chorus:]
Booty in the air, hands on the pole
You're the superstar, I just came to see your show
Shake it in my face and I'm a throw this money
I'm your number one fan for the night
I wanna see you dance for me
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me
Shake it in my face and I'm a throw this dollars up
I want to see you dance

[Verse 2:]
And the way you rotate it, got me gleanin my wallet
Girl you're bad than a motherfucker
I can't take my eyes off you
And baby I can't lie
I want you with your face down
Ass up in the sky
Legs up I'm a handle that
If it's good baby then I'm a double back
Drop it low on this love
Girl will you do that
Before I throw this money
I wanna see you twerk something

[Chorus:]
Booty in the air, hands on the pole
You're the superstar, I just came to see your show
Shake it in my face and I'm a throw this money
I'm your number one fan for the night
I wanna see you dance for me
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me
Shake it in my face and I'm a throw these dollars up
I want to see you dance
[Interlude:]
Move, your body, yeah, yeah
Move your body, yeah
Move, move, body, yeah, yeah
Move, body, yeah, yeah
Grindin slow

[Chorus:]
Booty in the air, hands on the pole
You're the superstar, I just came to see your show
Shake it in my face and I'm a throw this money
I'm your number one fan for the night
I wanna see you dance for me
Dance for me, dance for me, dance for me
Shake it in my face and I'm a throw this dollars up
I wanna see you dance
[Outro:]
I'm looking for a sexy girl to dance for me
Can you be that sexy girl? Dance for me
