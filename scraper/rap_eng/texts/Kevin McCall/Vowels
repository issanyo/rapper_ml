(Intro)
Show me what your name is
Let me spell it with my tongue
Do that shit on incursive bet I, bet I make you cum
My sex game is like Novocain, bet I leave it numb
Bet I make you cum, bet I, bet I make you cum

(Verse)
Oh, she said I keep her warm in the winter, winter
And take away her lonely nights
Just hold on, baby, sit back and enjoy the ride
I don’t need you to say a word at all
I just want to hear you scream
I’mma make it worth it all

(Pre-Chorus)
She know I’m going in, but she try to hold it in
She knows she’s about to go off, off, off
She knows she’s soaking wet, she’s dripping in my bed
She’s about to go crazy, yeah, yeah!

(Chorus)
Have her screaming out the vowels like
A A A A A E O U
Have her screaming out the vowels like
A A A A A E O U

Uh, uh, uh watch when I put this grown man on you!
You gonna be like, baby
And you’re going so deep!

(Verse)
But I’mma go deeper!
I’ll be killing that shit
Girl, I got that ether
That ether, have you speaking in tongues like a preacher, amen
Girl I hope you’re ready I’m bout to go in
If you can’t take it all, then say when
I’mma find her spot, I don’t say
Shawty try to hold it back, but she

(Pre-Chorus)
She know I’m going in, but she try to hold it in
She knows she’s about to go off, off, off
She knows she’s soaking wet, she’s dripping in my bed
She’s about to go crazy, yeah, yeah!

(Chorus x2)
Have her screaming out the vowels like
A A A A A E O U
Have her screaming out the vowels like
A A A A A E O U

(Outro)
Show me what your name is
Let me spell it with my tongue
Do that shit on incursive bet I, bet I make you cum
My sex game is like Novocain, bet I leave it numb
Bet I make you cum, bet I, bet I make you cum
