(Hook)

From the jungle but we some headhunters
We stay high in them trees like Koalas
She's a fiend for the Gualas
She don't go for the green like a runner
I ain't mad at you girl get your money

Yeah yeah

Verse 1:

Damn your eyes might be greener than my baby mama (Eva)
Saw these koalas with green and got naked like fuck designer
Pulling up on you put some respect on my name baby I'm a Stunna

Rarely make a promise but one thing I promise you I'm a gunna
Try to play with Bae and you's a Goner
Persecuted me for loving these trees yet call me stoner

(Stone)

Top shelf OG I should invite Ri rih over
Me wanna see your French pedicure over my shoulders

You should come over seas

(Hook)

From the jungle but we some headhunters
We stay high in them trees like Koalas
She a fiend for the Gualas
She don't go for the green like a runner
I ain't mad at you girl get your money

Verse 2:

I think I'm in love Robin stole my heart
So high off your body you're my drug
Instead of him should be loving me soul 4 real no Heavy D

(Hi Rihanna)

You should come over seas

With a real cali O.G not a wanna-be
IDK but I don't See what you see in CMB
Cake cake cake cake cake cake

(Hi Rihanna)

Write my name again on it like i did Birthday Cake

Pre hook:

Try to play with Bae and you's a Goner
Persecuted me for loving these trees yet call me stone
Top shelf OG I should invite Ri rih over
Me wanna see your French pedicure over my shoulders


(Hook)

From the jungle but we some headhunters
We stay high in them trees like Koalas
She's a fiend for the Gualas
She don't go for the green like a runner
I ain't mad at you girl get your money
