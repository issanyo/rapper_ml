[Intro]
What do you believe in, who?
What do you believe in, who?
What do you believe in, who?

[Verse 1]
Do you believe in magic?
Do you still believe in shooting stars?
Just imagine what can happen
Once you find out who you really are
Ain't no secret about it
I hear the desires inside your heart
Say it like you mean it
I'm listening to you

[Chorus]
Tell me all your secrets
Tell me all your secrets
Promise I'mma keep it
Promise I'mma keep it
And that ain't much of a secret
I'm listening to you
I'm listening to you

[Verse 2]
Faith is something soulful
Evidence of things unseen, no
And there ain't no secret about it
I hear the desires inside your heart
All you gotta do is believe
And a promise is already yours
What do you really want?

[Chorus]
I'm listening, I'm listening
I'm listening, I'm listening
I'm listening, I'm listening

[Bridge]
I don't know if you even really heard me
Scared stupid, Lord this prayer is my [?]
I don't know if you even really feeling this
I'm listening, I'm listening
Guess I gotta say it then
I still miss the days I used to share with my girl
I'm listening, I'm listening
She left to change my world
That's when me and you got closer
I'm listening, I'm listening
Just get it started, it ain't over
Like this war, baby, I'mma be your solider
Just tell me what you want, what you want

[Outro]
What do you believe in, who?
What do you believe in, who?
What do you believe in, who?
