[Intro]
You ever been mind fucked before? (oh, oh, oh, oh)
I'm mind fucking you right now (oh, oh, oh, oh)
Can you feel my dick fucking your mind? (oh, oh, oh, oh)
See, thats it! Thats the art of it!
I'm mind fucking the shit out you

[Verse 1]
Yeah baby
Look look
Uh
I'm mind fucking, mi-mi-mi-mind fucking you
All up in your head, got you feeling like I'm touching you
My pocket rocket ready to launch all because of you
We both ready to take off so I'm rushing you
Get it?
I said I'm rushing you
Not like throwing blows
But to get you out them clothes
And not totally nude
Thats typical, I suppose
You could, leave on your heels, but I know they hurt your toes
Wait, we ain't even finish dinner yet
And I'm already rambling about hot sex
Is it hot in here?
Or I got you wet
You just think I wanna hit like a cigarette
But I want more than a hit
I want the whole pack
Go with your first mind
Don't hold back
Yea
Now let me make a couple of drinks for us to throw back

[Hook]
Yes, it's true
I don't mind fucking you
But 'til then
I'm mind fucking you
I'm mind fucking you
Slowly undressing you
Without even touching you
(But I'm) I'm mind fucking you
I'm mind fucking you
You
You

[Verse 2]
What's your name, girl?
Let me spell it with my tongue while I'm kissing you in places that I know will turn you on
This might sound like a oxymoron:
But I won't let you leave until you cum
Take you down like a old Chris Brown song
Mike Tyson in the sheets when I nibble on your earlobe
Cause that's what I'm into
I got room for dessert and you next on the menu
Baby I promise you ain't had it like this
I'mma hit it like I can't miss
Run and tell your friends how freaky I'm is
I kiss your body in like seven different places
Call that seven deadly sins
Girl, you make a nigga want that
I wanna put my name on it like I own that
Cause I'm on that
I said what's my name?
And she was like "k-k-k-k-K Mac"

[Hook]
Yes, it's true
I don't mind fucking you
But 'til then
I'm mind fucking you
I'm mind fucking you
Slowly undressing you
Without even touching you
(But I'm) I'm mind fucking you
I'm mind fucking you
You
You

[Bridge]
No, I ain't a player
I'm just flirty as hell
Take down my name and number
Girl, it's easy to spell
Hope to see you later
I'll be at my hotel
Already got you under my spell
Cause I'm mind fucking you
Oh
What's a classy girl like you doing in a dirty mind like mine?
Oh
Yeah, you the good-girl type but I'm
Mind fucking you, oh
Mind fucking you, whoa
Right now (right now)
Can't you feel it?
Feel it
Feel it

[Hook]
Yes, it's true
I don't mind fucking you
But 'til then
I'm mind fucking you
I'm mind fucking you
Slowly undressing you
Without even touching you
(But I'm) I'm mind fucking you
I'm mind fucking you
You
You

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh...
