[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah
You don't even hear me
You can't see me (ahh)
Wish I could touch you
Show you how I love you, but
You don't even hear me
You can't see me
Wish I could touch you
Show you how I love you, but (love you, but)
But, you don't even hear me
Wish there was something I could do (I could do)
For you, to hear me (ahh)
I need you to hear me
'Cause I miss you (I miss you)
I really do (I really do)
Miss you
