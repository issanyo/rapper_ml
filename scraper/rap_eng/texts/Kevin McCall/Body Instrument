Treasure Davis...

[Verse 1:]
Woooah
Just like a guitar
You can play my body, before the stromming starts
Whisper to me softly boy...
Tell me it’s all right ohh, it’s time to speed up
It'll turn the heat up, we ain't gotta rush nothing
Start it off slow then speed up.. for me boy, ohhhh

[Chorus:]
Baby we can listen to
The sounds that we make when I'm sexing you
Our bodies are like instruments
Play it over and over again, ohh yeah
Play me, make me feel everything
Your saying, show me how creative you are
Let me sing the key to your heart..
So you can use your hands, use your lips
Whatever you need to, show me how creative you are
Let me sing the key to your heart
Play my body like an instrument, ohh
Play my body like an instrument, ohh

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
I’ma put my hands on you
Play your body like a flute
I’ma work my hands and lips at the same time, (Like a freaky love song)
You can take the top, I take the bottom
I can go deeper that ain't a problem
‘cause I know you like my sexy baritone all in your ear
And I'll whisper to you baby
Bring your body here
To me, to me, I’ma play it like the symphony, baby..

[Chorus:]
Baby we can listen to
The sounds that we make when I'm sexing you
Our bodies are like instruments
Play it over and over again, ohh yeah
Play me, make me feel everything you’re saying
Show me how creative you are
Let me sing the key to your heart..
So you can use your hands, use your lips, whatever you need to
Show me how creative you are
Let me sing the key to your heart
Play my body like an instrument, ohh
Play my body like an instrument, ohh

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
You gonna get an encore
Baby girl cause I can tell you want more
And I'll get a standing ovation, ahuh
And I'm gonna take you backstage and

Know what, what am gonna show you

[Chorus:]
Play me, make me feel everything you're saying
Show me how creative you are
Let me sing the key to your heart
So you can use your hands, use your lips
Whatever you need to, show me how creative you are
Let me sing the key to your heart ooh...
