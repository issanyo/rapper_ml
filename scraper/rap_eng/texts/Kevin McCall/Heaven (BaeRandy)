[Verse 1]
You and me, girl we're like two angels
When we're winged to piece
Baby I swear only together we
We can make it to heaven if you hold on it

[Chorus]
It feel like heaven
It feel like heaven
It feel like heaven
Somebody call her heaven

[Verse 2]
If you're done with me, I'll make you believe it
Me and you were made for love, maybe it was just made for us
Together I swear that you and me should climb the stairway to heaven
Me and you were made for love or maybe it was made for us
Me and you were made for love or maybe it was
I really hope you know this, notice what I'm holding
Inside my hand, yeah it's closed but I'm open to you
Ain't closed to look in, see your heart's inside it
Butterflies got me flying high

[Chorus]
It feel like heaven
It feel like heaven
It feel like heaven
Somebody call her heaven

[Verse 3]
You're my mariposa
So damn fly, I need you close
Gotta know you, gotta show you
Just how much I love you
I hear 'em talk but baby, let 'em talk
I'm too busy listening to your body language
That kinky hair and that sexy walk
Really don't matter how high I get
As long as it's you I'm flying with
All my exes like damn, what I miss
All these love letters sealed with a kiss
No MC Hammer shit, this ain't too legit
Be true, mariposa, I love you
Let me help you undress your wings and fly away with you

[Chorus]
It feel like heaven
It feel like heaven
It feel like heaven
Somebody call her heaven

[Bridge]
Float away in the night sky
Bumping full moon

[Chorus]
It feel like heaven
It feel like heaven
It feel like heaven
Somebody call her heaven
