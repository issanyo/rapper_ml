[Intro]
DJ Drama, the Affiliates nigga, Trendsetters Sense

[Verse 1]
Shawty fine, walking by, make a nigga look
See the way she toot it up, got a nigga stuck
Suited and booted up, shutting down the club
Look at shawty's hip, once she winds it up
Now rewind that back
Put it in reverse baby I like that
Can't nobody do it better
Let you do your thing while I sip this Amaretto

[Pre-Chorus]
I love the way you wind slow, oh oh girl, girl when you crawl up on the ting
Make it touch the floor, oh oh girl, girl just keep on winding
Girl when you back it up, here a real bad man wanna see you back it up
Wave your hands in the air see ya clap it up, come look at yo-you work aye you girl in  tied up skirt

[Chorus]
Girl the way you move ya body make me wana hit it
I know you classy but you still can act a hoe wit it
It ain't no question bout it, shawty you can get it
The only question is, can you work with it?
Can you work with it? Can you work with it?
Can you work with it? Can you work with it?
Can you twerk with it? Can you work with it?
Can you work with it? Aha

[Verse 2]
Throw it back at me, I'mma hit of home run
Swinging my bat like my name A. Rod
I'mma have you screaming out "Oh My God"
When I find yo spot, girl
And I'mma have you running from this D
Like a crook running from the police
But I'm gon' get ya
Going down town lemme read you your Miranda

[Pre-Chorus]
I love the way you wind slow, oh oh girl, girl when you crawl up on the ting
Make it touch the floor, oh oh girl, girl just keep on winding
Girl when you back it up, here a real bad man wanna see you back it up
Wave your hands in the air see ya clap it up, come look at yo-you work aye you girl with the tied up skirt

[Chorus]
Girl the way you move ya body make me wana hit it
I know you classy but you still can act a hoe wit it
It ain't no question bout it, shawty you can get it
The only question is, can you work with it?
Can you work with it? Can you work with it?
Can you work with it? Can you work with it?
Can you twerk with it? Can you work with it?
Can you work with it? Aha

[Pre-Chorus]
I love the way you wind slow, oh oh girl, girl when you crawl up on the ting
Make it touch the floor, oh oh girl, girl just keep on winding
Girl when you back it up, here a real bad man wanna see you back it up
Wave your hands in the air see ya clap it up, come look at yo-you work aye you girl with the tied up skirt
