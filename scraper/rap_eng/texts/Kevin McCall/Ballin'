[Chorus: Kevin McCall]
Balling like a bitch, you can't tell me nothing 'cause I'm balling like a bitch
Filthy ass rich, swimming in this money 'cause I'm balling like a, balling like a
Balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch
Filthy ass rich, swimming in this money 'cause I'm balling like a, balling like a

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Look, BBC hat clean diamond snap hook
Take a picture with it like it's my last look
Gold Mac Book, cost 100 G's
I don't fuck with rats, I throw away the cheese
I'm balling baby, you see this nigga shine
I'm running shit, finish line
K-Mac cook that beat, I eat it like it's dinner time
Awards show gimme mine, loud and clear, intercom
Listen up, I show you how to stunt
Pocket full of money, you should see what's in the trunk
That bass got that bump, that shit that make you jump
Balling like a bitch, throw it up, slam dunk
V-neck like a quedo, rolling dice in the casino
Three bad chicks rolling trips, Cee-Lo
What's done is done, ain't no coming back
I'm balling like a bitch, roger that, it's Breezy baby

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Balling like a bitch, you can't tell me nothing 'cause I'm balling like a bitch
Filthy ass rich, swimming in this money 'cause I'm balling like a, balling like a
I'm balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, watch me do my shit
'Cause I'm balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, watch me take some shit

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Uh, snap back, nigga back up in this bitch
Throwing by the 100/s watching strippers do the splits
Go on hit that flex, I ain't tripping on the bitches
Probably, 1 out of a 10 in California, I ain't hit
Bitch, I'm raw smell that shit
Hold our jaw up in your lips
Get a silly straw, have a sip
Motherfucking Tyga, she ain't met me then she lying
I pull that rocker out nigga, David and Goliath
Melt your fucking face boy, like that nigga on the Wire
Them niggas washed up, need a dry, dry 'em
Free my brother Weezy, now we back up on your TV
I'm rolling at 250, speeding me my nigga Breezy
Right behind me, Range Rove, T-Rell
Bunch a bad bitches tongue tied and bitches, what it do?
It's Young Money 'til the death bed
If anything, we the best and it's probably this

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Balling like a bitch, you can't tell me nothing 'cause I'm balling like a bitch
Filthy ass rich, swimming in this money 'cause I'm balling like a, balling like a
I'm balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, watch me do my shit
'Cause I'm balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, balling like a bitch, watch me take some shit
