[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
I believe in love right now and girl, I can’t hold back, gotta let it out
Like a song stuck in my head, I wanna make love on this waterbed
You give me every reason to, to think about holding you
Touching you, loving you, baby, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
You got something special, I don’t wanna let go
Cannonball into my bed, we're loving on a waterbed
Hope you don’t get seasick, girl, aquafina under your body
I'll stroke it, stroke it, are you wet?
Can we make love on a waterbed? On a waterbed-bed-bed
On a waterbed-bed-bed, woah
Can we make love on a waterbed? On a waterbed-bed-bed
On a waterbed-bed-bed, on a waterbed, oh, woah

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Like an anchor, girl, it’s going down
Me versus you, baby girl, let’s go 12 rounds
Hold my hand, girl, I won’t let you drown
And don’t it feel good right now?
Baby girl, I'm looking deep in your eyes, your legs trembling
I'm swimming in your body
I'm your number one fan, girl
I want you more than anything

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
You got something special, I don’t wanna let go
Cannonball into my bed, we're loving on a waterbed
Hope you don’t get seasick, girl, aquafina under your body (you make m seasick, baby)
I'll stroke it, stroke it, are you wet? (Get it, get, it, damn, haha)
Can we make love on a waterbed? On a waterbed-bed-bed
On a waterbed-bed-bed, woah
Can we make love on a waterbed? On a waterbed-bed-bed
On a waterbed-bed-bed, on a waterbed

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Okay, my sex is like your next breath, so I know you need it
You on my waterbed, but I can't tell which one leakin'
You can let it spill like wine, this ain't no Tempur-Pedic
Sex so good, it'll have you screamin', "Hallelujah," think you Jesus
Guess the room pissed off 'cause it's gettin' heated
Just let your bra slip off, you don't even need it
Let me check your pulse, make sure you're still breathin'
'Cause once you in my waterbed, it's killer season, believe it

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Chris Brown]
Hope you don’t get seasick, girl, aquafina under your body
I'll stroke it, stroke it, are you wet?
Can we make love on a waterbed? On a waterbed-bed-bed
On a waterbed-bed-bed, woah
Can we make love on a waterbed? On a waterbed-bed-bed
On a waterbed-bed-bed, on a waterbed
