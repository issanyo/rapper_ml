[Intro]
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold, cold
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold, cold

[Verse 1: Chrishan]
Girl be careful what you say, to me
It ain't nothing but a thang, to me
I can make your life a living Hell
Thought I told you not to play with me

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you better watch your tone
Don't know what's been going on
But you' fuckin' up your home baby
I've been tryna keep it cool
But you breaking all the rules
I'm telling you

[Chorus]
You're hot and you're cold, cold
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold, cold
One minute I'm with cha...
Next minute you switch up
Sometimes I don't know, know

You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold, cold
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold

[Verse 2: Chrishan]
Girl you don't know who you' fucking with
But I know you ain't gone fuckin' win
You forget, I know you very well
But you' steady round here talking shit

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl you better watch your tone
Don't know what's been going on
But you' fuckin' up your home baby
I've been tryna keep it cool
But you breaking all the rules
I'm telling you

[Chorus]
You're hot and you're cold, cold
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold, cold
One minute I'm with cha...
Next minute you switch up
Sometimes I don't know, know

You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold, cold
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold

[Ad-Lib: Kevin McCall]
Yea.. K-Mac

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Bitch!
What the fuck wrong with you?
Ya hot then ya cold like you gotta fuckin' flu
How you don't see that the problem is you?
You hearing rumors about me
And they're probably true (true)
You know what it is (is)
You was plan A
But I keep a plan B
Like I don't want kids
Thing about it is, my nigga CJ and my big sis' told me
You was a crazy bitch (crazy bitch)
You think I'm 'bout to deal with all that drama?
I deal with enough of that
On top that I got a crazy ass baby mama (mama)
It never rains in Southern California
But you make a nigga sicker than pneumonia

[Chorus]
You're hot and you're cold, cold
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold, cold (I'm too rich for this)
One minute I'm with cha...
Next minute you switch up
Sometimes I don't know, know

You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold, cold
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold

[Fade Out]
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold, cold
You're like Winter...
In California
You're hot and you're cold
