[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Take it off, I wanna love you
And everybody, wanna touch you
You moving right, wanna see what's up under
You back it up, beep beep like a trucker
Nice thighs, nice waist
And you know I can't forget about your face
But don't none of that matter
I'm about to make your pockets fatter

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Girl I just wanna see you strip right now cause it's late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip
Girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip
God damn you sexy, for me
God damn you sexy, baby
God damn you sexy
Girl, I just wanna see you

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Got my shades on, with my Jays on
In the club with a pocket full of ones
This girl booty outta control
There she go, up and down the pole
Which one I'mma take home? Get my freak on
If you ain't freaking we ain't speaking
Think I'm playing? No I'm not
Let me see you back it up and drop
Yeah, I wanna see your legs in the air
Baby don't worry about your hair
All those tracks
I don't give a damn 'bout that
In the club and they playing my song
Turn it up, play it all night long
If you think you can and you know you can
I'mma give you all this money, money, money

[Chorus]
Girl I just wanna see you strip right now cause it's late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip
Girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip
God damn you sexy, for me
God damn you sexy, baby
God damn you sexy
Girl, I just wanna see you

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Pants, shirt, you could take it off
Panties, bra, you could take it off
Red-bottom heels, you could take 'em, wait, wait
Leave 'em on cause I like my women tall
Got a hot mama, you're hotter than a sauna
I want to peel them clothes off your body like a banana
The only reason I dress you in that designer
Is to get you out that Dolce & Gabanna
I throw this money up, she watch it all fall
Toot that thang up, pop it for a boss
Anything you wanting baby, you can have it all
Starting with my last name, now they call you Mrs. McCall

[Chorus]
Girl I just wanna see you strip right now cause it's late babe
Girl I just wanna see you strip
Girl take your time with it
Girl I just wanna see you strip
God damn you sexy, for me
God damn you sexy, baby
God damn you sexy
Girl, I just wanna see you
