[Verse 1]
It's a holiday, yeah, spend it with you baby
I think that I'm in love this Christmas, yeah
Just hanging stockings on the fireplace, you know that Santa's coming to town
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh ride now
So today is all about Cupid, the mistletoe can pull us closer
It's what I'm waiting for, it sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's

[Pre-Chorus]
So land on top of your roof, them sleigh bells is ringing
I'll be up all night with you, them carols are singing
Japan to Peru, baby me and you
This Christmas Eve

[Chorus]
Be my date this Christmas Eve, be my holiday, my dream
Lay your head on me, I got you babe
Kissing underneath the tree, I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need
Let me give you all of me, each year, together on this Christmas Eve

[Verse 2]
You leave some cookies out, I'mma eat 'em all
Nobody can see me but you, it's so magical
When we use imagination, we can fly to Never-Neverland
The north pole ain't that cold, if you wanna go, I got you baby, girl

[Bridge]
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Christmas
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be, I promise I won't do you wrong

[Chorus]
Be my date this Christmas Eve, be my holiday, my dream
Lay your head on me, I got you babe
Kissing underneath the tree, I don't need no presents girl, you're everything I need
Let me give you all of me, each year, together on this Christmas Eve

[Outro]
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Christmas
Be be be, be my, be my, Christmas Eve
Be be
