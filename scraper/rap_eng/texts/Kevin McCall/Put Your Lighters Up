[Hook: Chris Brown]
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your hands in the air right now

[Verse 1: Diesel]
Pull up to the club and a nigga hostin'
But when you walkin' in to that, pay me what they owe me
Paparazzi flash lookin' somethin' like a strobe light
Diamonds on my neck 'cause I’m blessed, kazoom type
Breaks old manner then it’s off to play house
My studio, bitches poppin' at my house
Secret Sundays pop a bottle, put your lighters up
If you ain’t make it in, it's aight, baby, go with us

[Pre-Hook: Kevin McCall]
I’m about to turn the lights down low up in this club
And if you really came to party, let me see everybody with your lighters up

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your hands in the air right now

[Verse 2: Diesel]
We break down, smoke up like a bull truck
Ace by the case, put your motherfuckin' lighters up
The squad in the club, mad Diesel turned up
Breezy boughtthe bar, we all for bottles of what the fuck
The booty is poppin', nigga, the bitches just plottin'
We choose a couple of hotties and put some drugs in their body
And just do it
Rock star life, spark a lighter for the movement 'cause

[Pre-Hook: Kevin McCall]
I’m about to turn the lights down low up in this club
And if you really came to party, let me see everybody with your lighters up

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your hands in the air right now

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
We poppin' bottles in the club and
Look at the ladies all upon us now
Could get a fuck about a hater
Countin' all this paper
Tell the DJ to play it back now
Come girl, if you lonely
And you know you wanna whine with me, girl
And move your hips and sway
Pull up DJ, put up your lighters in the air right now

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your hands in the air right now
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your lighters up
Put your lighters up, put your hands in the air right now

[Outro: Kevin McCall]
And we gon' burn it up 'til the DJ turn it up
Put your lighters up if you got that fire
Smoke in the air, got me feelin' so right
And we gon' burn it up in the club
We 'bout to set this club on fire, let the fucker burn
We don't gotta worry just let the fucker burn
