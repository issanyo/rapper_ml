[Intro: Eric Bellinger & Tank]
All I want is you, girl
All I want is you, girl
Yeah, oh, no
Woah, woah
Baby, yeah, yeah
Oh no, no
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
When I put it down on you, girl, you're gonna like what I do, girl
Keep it between me and you, girl, all I want is you, girl
When I put it down on you, girl, you're gonna like what I do, girl
Keep it between me and you, girl, all I want is you, girl

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Ay, shawty what's the deal?
You looking so fly and I gotta keep it real
I know I ain't the first and I won't be the last
But I found a new best friend in you
Girl, it's something about you, don't know what it is
But I loving it, it could be the way that you move on the dance floor
Girl, my body, body, want you to ride it, ride it
If you single, girl, let's get it, my place your place, go on with it

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Go and light those candle lights, dance all night
Sex you right, girl, you should come over
And get it on, all night long, that's nothing wrong
Girl, I promise
You can get it off, you can get it off
Girls there's so many things I wanna do
I wanna make your love come down, love come down, love come down
Baby, I'll make you scream out, whoa

[Verse 2: Tank]
Soon as the door opens, you know we gon' get it on
Like we never left the club 'cause I can still hear my song
Girl, I want you to come closer now
I wanna make your body scream and shout
My hand rubbing on your thigh, I see it in your eyes
You looking like you want it whoa, you sure, let's get rid of that
You know that I wanna do what you wanna do
Girl, let's get it on

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Tank]
I wanna light those candle lights, dance all night
Sex you right, girl, you should come over
And get it on, all night long, that's nothing wrong
Girl, I promise
You can get it off, you can get it off
Girls there's so many things I wanna do
I wanna make your love come down, love come down, love come down
Baby, I'll make you scream out, whoa

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
Give me a minute, let me catch my breath
I'ma give it to you 'til it's nothin' left
I'ma have you tellin' me I'm the best
But you ain't even really seen nothin' yet
On some Twilight shit, how I bite your neck
Leavin' hickies, no quickies, I'ma go all night, don't need no rest
Let me get you up out that dress, put you can leave them heels on
Let me taste your candy coated raindrops like that's for real so
Bedroom, call that the kill zone 'cause when I get you alone

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Tank]
Baby, I'll make you feel, make you scream, whoa oh
I said, baby, when I put it down

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
When I put it down on you, girl, you're gonna like what I do, girl
Keep it between me and you, girl, all I want is you, girl
When I put it down on you, girl, you're gonna like what I do, girl
Keep it between me and you, girl, all I want is you, girl
All I want baby is you, girl, all I want is you, girl
All I want baby is you, girl, all I want is you, girl
All I want baby is you, girl, all I want is you, girl
All I want baby is you, girl, all I want is you, girl
