[Intro]
Love is blind, love is blind
Love is blind, love is blind

[Verse: Kevin McCall]
Not too fast, you won't get me again
Now I caught you red handed
Thinking you were some super man
Like I'm so stupid, I'm a groupie, I'm a 20 dollar hoe
No, I'm not but I need adjusting, you now hot
What you to see just what I do, boy, watch
'Cause I'ma get you with your pants down, it's my turn

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I think it's finally your turn to get burned
So I'm about to burn ya, yeah
I can feel it deep inside ya
It's all up in your chest, you got heartburn
