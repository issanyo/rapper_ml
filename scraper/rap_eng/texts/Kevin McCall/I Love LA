Walk with me for a minute to my hood, man
It’s west coast shit

Look, the west got it out
Drug dealers and thugs yeah the west got it out
They say it’s cribs, bloods, the west got it out
So if you fix your … the west is falling off
All them niggers are just lames is waiting to set it off
Something like Queen Latifa and that movies set it off
Knock it off
Yeah I want no parts, call you the tin man, cause you got no heart
To the west you no match cause you got no spark
I’m rapping for the west, I’m making my mark
In the history of west coast music
On some mind tale shit, this is how we do it
This is for the kids, cause they’re easily influenced
I’ma make sure that I’m only speaking with the truth is
Ain’t nothing worse than a waste of talent
I ain’t gonna say that I’m the best when the … is rapid
But everything I do, I do my best at it
And keep my head up like a 2Pac rap alley
I see drug dealers, I see drug addicts
I see church folk and all 3 got habits
A whole bunch of Eves, a whole bunch of Adams
They ain’t learn from the Bible, they still ate the apple
Indy yellow on the beat, is so beastie
What’s up my nigga, I’m so easty
I think I’m dr. dre ice cube and easy E, a nigga with an attitude

They want that hood shit, they want that California love
My niggers will roll up that good shit
I got love for every hood, at the end of the day
I love LA, I love LA, I love LA, I love LA

You so beat dead bro, and my past life
That they call me king diamond I play my cards right
Look at my chain glow, diamonds lighting up
The chain swing low, sweet chariot
I make it Shawty aware so I call her Aquarius
I make such terrestrial you niggers are aliens
I got a dark chick and a yellow bone
They … like the
Get it, that mean they bad low key
Why these niggers fronting like they don’t know me
When they … play my song every night before she sleep, damn
Now I see while niggers… till the death of me
Till it’s nothing left for me
Lord … niggers can’t …
I mean fuck with us, oops, I ain’t meant to curse
I guess I got lost in my rhymes, warrup bussa buss
Picture me walking down Avalon
Wife beater and my chucks on
Hood famous, whole neighborhood knows my songs
But I ain’t stopping till all of my young niggers know
I’m from the land the gang stars and drug dealers
And next killers, praying to god forgive them
So I don’t do it for the game, Jehovah my witness
I do it for my hood niggers, the women and children

They want that hood shit, they want that California love
My niggers will roll up that good shit
I got love for every hood, at the end of the day
I love LA, I love LA, I love LA, I love LA
