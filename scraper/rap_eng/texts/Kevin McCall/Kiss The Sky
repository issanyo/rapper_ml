[Verse 1]

What if I made love to your mind?
What if I, sent chills all the way down your spine?
What if the birds had a fear of heights?
What if the stars had a fear of being the light?
They would never feel alive

[Hook]
They would never kiss the sky
They would never know what true love is
They would never kiss the sky (never)
No, they would never know the sweetness of her lips
They would never kiss the sky

[Bridge]
They would never kiss the sky, we would never kiss the sky
And the sky would never kiss us back
Sky would never kiss us back
We would never kiss the sky
And the sky would never kiss us back... we would never kiss the sky

[Verse 2]
What if a kiss had no goodbye?
What if me had no "U" and you had no "I"?
What if your ex had all the answers why?
[?]
Must got a twinnie, twin, twin I swear you twice as fine
I'm in your birthday suit must be a Gemini
If the tears we cried never dried

[Hook]
They would never kiss the sky
They would never know what true love is
They would never kiss the sky (never)
No, they would never know the sweetness of her lips
They would never kiss the sky

[Bridge]
They would never kiss the sky, we would never kiss the sky
And the sky would never kiss us back
Sky would never kiss us back
We would never kiss the sky
And the sky would never kiss us back... we would never kiss the sky
