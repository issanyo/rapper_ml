Tonight I'm gonna your Body,Body go limber
(Mmmmhm)Make your liver quiver
Tonight I'm gunna make you forget them other niggas

Wetter than a river (x2)
(Mmmmhm)Make your liver quiver
Tonight I'm gunna make you forget them other niggas

[Verse 1: Malik Lee]
Time to set the mood,Time to set shit right
Cause tonight I'mma beat that pussy up like Tyson fight
No Loverance,Ms Hot pants
Don't play games,Don't just dance
Got me enchanted off that first glance
Bring that ass here,Are those implants?
Naw,I'm playing boo
Gotta listen to what I'm telling you
Let's go back to the room
I'mma be bustin' soon
And maybe your friends can come too
Come to our next show
GT's on that next flow
Don't be hating on the next ho
Or tonight's gonna be stressful
Like lloyd said Lay yo head down
Opportunist after that next round
Ambitious Bitch,Wale sound,That slight work,That fast twerk
Said that's not how her man works
Why gotta bring up that clown
He made the flower squirt but I'll make that bitch drown
I'mma tell you what we gonna do
That pussy I'm tryna break through
I meant break in,Like a safe and
No limit & Restrictions
My Prediction,Like a psychic
Is you,me & a side chick
Come meet my sidekick
Get saved by this super dick

So you'll be

[Hook]
Wetter than a river
Tonight I'm gonna your Body,Body go limber

Cause you Wetter than a river
Wetter than a river
Wetter than a river
Make your Body quiver
Cause you Wetter than a river
Wetter than a river
Wetter than a river
Tonight I'm gunna make you forget them other niggas

[Verse 2: K.C.B]
Aye we should F.U.C.K
I could say it again thank you to the man who invented leggings
And my blood for my genes which made the girl come to me the king with those tight jeans and Concords
Peel them off like tangerines picking up your clothes like girl
You wore these jeans girl you wore these jeans
First we converse,then I immerse myself into her flood
Have her coming quick coming in deep new York knick hoop dreams
She said I should take my talents to south beach submarine
I say only if it's clean love is war and I'm a marine
And it would be good if we this our routine (Owwww)
Pow pow army now kill it and put it in a hearse
Are you on the menu that's gravy poutine you sweet candy
Just to let you know I bite Yo just gimme the green light
You where I stay my bedroom is the venue go like deep like the navy wavii
Ya man probly say he can make your panties dampen thatts nothing then again
I bet if I make you wet and sweat I'll show you your worth
And make him mad cause you say you say from Argentina
Mixed with Cuban and Jamaican and down there your Brazilian
I got a thing for those Spanish girls like Cubana Borica viva la Kodey
Keep it tight you know sexy for Kodey
If you from I make it wet Niagara falls and
If you from the south I make wet Hurricane Katrina coming down
From up above rain get you on all fours
Ha enough with the metaphor
Alright,alright,alright,girl what you doing tonight?
