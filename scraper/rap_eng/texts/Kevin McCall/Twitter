[Intro: DJ Drama]
Quality music, Trendsetter, Gangsta Griliz, Breezy

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Look, I does my S-H-I-T
Please excuse me for the smell
For certain thing does my jerk thing and I keep her working
She a star on the track like Pharrell
Look, I does my S-H-I-T
Please excuse me for the smell
For certain thing does my jerk thing and I keep her working
She a star on the track like Pharrell, na'mean?
Your money slow mo, my money like promo
Giving autographs with the cash no photos
Uh flow sicker than Polio, hit it from the back guarantee to give ya scoliosis
Sorry homie but I'm boning yo sis and she love it
When I take her down even when I do my dougie, like a DJ in the bed when I'm cutting
See the kid pull up in that big truck, call it tonka
Club like the chocolate factory, Willy Wonka
Girl, I want ya
But you're too much taste so sweet 'bout to give me a sugar rush

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I be going out, I'm a go getter
I be pulling all the chicks they follow me like twitter (twitter)
Follow me like twitter, follow, follow me like twitter
Hanging on every word that I say
They know what I'm about, colder than the winter
Y'all ain't messing with me, y'all just some beginners
Follow me like twitter, follow me like twitter (twitter)
Follow me, follow me (yeah)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
As I'm sitting on top of my ego
That's the world and I'm flyer than the eagle
And she a weapon and I know she kinda lethal
My flow sicker than cancer, need chemo
And as the world turns, yeah I get it in
Got Obama stacks, I'm counting presidents
Know who I'm better than, but I don't mention them
Number one in the game, they on the bench and shit
Cause I do my damn thing
My body tagged up like a Picasso painting
Neck full of ice baby lets go skating
Or we can take a trip to Beijing
Million dollar house, million dollar fits
Call me Jackie Chan with these million dollar kicks
And you know I'm the man with these million dollar chicks
So guess what's in my hand? These million dollar tits

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I be going out, I'm a go getter
I be pulling all the chicks they follow me like twitter (twitter)
Follow me like twitter, follow, follow me like twitter
Hanging on every word that I say
They know what I'm about, colder than the winter
Y'all ain't messing with me, y'all just some beginners
Follow me like twitter, follow me like twitter (twitter)
Follow me, follow me (yeah)

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
Ladies, how ya been?
I know you've been waiting for me, now I'm back again, again
Run along and tell ya friends and watch them girl them say
You know you down for the man name, Chris Brown
Introducing you to something new, something that you never seen before
The Lamborghini with the four-door, we can U-stream all the footage, babe
Tell me what it feel like to roll with a boss?
Hit me up on twitter baby we can kick it off, we can kick it off

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
I be going out, I'm a go getter
I be pulling all the chicks they follow me like twitter (twitter)
Follow me like twitter, follow, follow me like twitter
Hanging on every word that I say
They know what I'm about, colder than the winter
Y'all ain't messing with me, y'all just some beginners
Follow me like twitter, follow me like twitter (twitter)
Follow me, follow me (yeah)
