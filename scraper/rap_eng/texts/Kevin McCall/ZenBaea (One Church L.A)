[Verse 1]
I see you going up now, ZenBaea
To keep around, made me wanna take a chance on love now, ZenBaea, no stopping ever
Baby me and you can ride out, got a real one in your corner
Put that nigga on timeout
Money talk, I can't hear you, what you say now?
Hol' up, he from outta town and he tryna rep the game, I'm like how?
See this Rollie, I'm from watch so they know what time it is right now
I got church in the morning, girl I can't mess around with you, no

[Chorus]
You should come with me, the one
You should come with me, the one
Cause loving you is easy
Easy like a Sunday
I think you might be the one
You should come with me, the one
We should start a family
I be your Cam Newton babe, any given Sunday

[Verse 2]
Girl I'm far from rich but you make me wanna sing like Lionel
Girl your love so classic, make me wanna lay you down on vinyl
After church, we can hit Coolies while we listen to [?]
Shawty tryna get saved, shawty tryna get saved
The Lord gon' save ya, forget a bae, need a [?] on set
Type of woman that can pray for me
The type of woman that can pray for me cause I need it babe

[Chorus]
You should come with me, the one
You should come with me, the one
Cause loving you is easy
Easy like a Sunday
I think you might be the one
You should come with me, the one
We should start a family
I be your Cam Newton babe, any given Sunday

[Verse 3]
All that bumping of the gums
Really starting to take a toll on my main toll
Had to pull it to the back in the Benz
So, one word and it's murder she wrote
We gon' hit the 105, west off of central
Promise I'll be faithful like central
If you love God you know I mean to
You the one, I mean to
Sit next to me, right in the front view
I want the world to see I love you
East on the side, I wanna bump you
But I still serve you, you
But I still serve you
One word is all we need
To destroy captivity
And break the chains that are binding
One reign on world
This language your expertise
Take the faith in me, oh my God

[Intro]
You should come with me, the one
You might be the one
You could be my first lady
I be your toy
You be my center
I could take care of you
