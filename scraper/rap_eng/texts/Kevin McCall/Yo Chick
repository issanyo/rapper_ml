[Intro: Ty Dolla $ign]
She let me tag from the front (front), tag it from the back (back)
(Dolla $ign)

[Verse 1: Kevin McCall]
Told myself I would never fight over a broad
Till i was heartbroke and couldn’t get over a broad
Was it true love? Who the fuck knows?
Whacha think I did? Recruit a new ho
I see bitches cheat on me with a nigga they love (love)
So when it come to bitches, I dunno who to trust (oh no)
Rick James said cocaine was a hell of a drug (yeah)
But cocaine ain’t got shit on fornication and love
How would you feel that I told you that I fucked yo bitch? (I did)
Not yo EX girl, the-the-the-the one you with (???)
You should be ashamed for the shit she did (oooh)
Shit, whacha expect, these bitches devilish

[Hook: Kevin McCall]

You already know that you can’t trust these hoes (Nah, nah)
So before you try to wife her up
I think you should know, I...
I fucked yo chick (chick) (Oh!) x2
I'm telling you the truth, and now it's on you
These hoes ain’t sh... shit
And you know this (Oh, woah) x2
She know it (Ooh woah)
She ratchet

[Verse 2 : Ty Dolla $ign]
She let me
Tag it from the front (front), tag it from the back (back)
If I was you, I wouldn’t kiss that rack
I was balls deep in yo bitch like a hole in one
Call me Tiger Dolla $ign, bitch, I got more than one
I don’t stress a bit, I just stretch yo bitch
Now yo key don't fit, she call the locksmith
I’m in this bitch, gynecologist
I beat it up, I squashed it

[Hook: Kevin McCall & Ty Dolla $ign]

You already know that you can’t trust these hoes (Oh nah) (These bitches devilish)
Nah, nah, so before you try to wife her up (wife her up)
I think you should know, I...
I fucked yo chick (chick) x2 (You know I did)
I'm telling you the truth, and now it's on you
These hoes ain’t sh... shit
And you know this (Oh, woah) x2
And she know it (Oh, woah)
She ratchet (Yeah, ooh yeah, I fucked your....)

And you know this
