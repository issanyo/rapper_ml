[Chorus]
From the jungle but we still in harness
We stay high in them trees like koalas
Jail fiend, for the guala
She gon' go for the green like a runner
I ain't mad at you girl, get your money
I ain't mad at you girl, get your money

[Verse 1]
Damn your eyes might be greener than my baby mama's
Saw these koalas with green, they got nigga like fuck designer
Pulling up on you, put some respek on my name baby, I'm a stunner
Rarely make a promise, one thing I promise you, I'm a goner

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to play with bae and you's a goner
Pursecute for loving these trees, yeah call me stoner
[?] RiRi
Wanna see your French pedicure over my shoulders
You should come overseas

[Chorus]
From the jungle but we still in harness
We stay high in them trees like koalas
Jail fiend, for the guala
She gon' go for the green like a runner
I ain't mad at you girl, get your money
I ain't mad at you girl, get your money

[Verse 2]
I think I'm in love
Robin stole my heart
So high off your body
You're my drug
Instead of him, should be loving me
You should come overseas with a real gunner OG
I don't want no games, I do games but I don't see what you see
Cake, cake, cake, cake
[?] like I did [?]

[Pre-Chorus]
Try to play with bae and you's a goner
Pursecute for loving these trees, yeah call me stoner
[?] RiRi
Wanna see your French pedicure over my shoulders
You should come overseas

[Chorus]
From the jungle but we still in harness
We stay high in them trees like koalas
Jail fiend, for the guala
She gon' go for the green like a runner
I ain't mad at you girl, get your money
I ain't mad at you girl, get your money
