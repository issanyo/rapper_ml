Even when I'm not around, they know
Even when I'm outta town, they know
In that time you and me step out, they know
They know one thing's for sure
This shit is all yours, all yours
All yours, all yours
You ain't even gotta ask
Girlyou go it's all yours
All yours, all yours
You know it's yours and I know it's mine


[Verse 1 : AD]
You ain't gotta worry, girl I'm all you
So fuck these bitches, ain't concerned bout what they all do
And when I'm home, every time a nigga call you
You grab yo bag, you drop your plans and you gon' fall through
Hard true, when you need it I'll be right there in a hurry
I know it's scary thinkin' that your man is temporary
Your vision blurry, put my past behind me, girl it's buried
So lemme love you now, all night until [?]
I ain't playin', leave your business when I'm done with it
Wake me up and start it over, have some fun with it
And I ain't trippin' you my girl, I use my tongue with it
You the quitter every time I have to come with it
Guarantee you get the best of me, it's no stress to me
Give you ecstasy without the ecstasy
I'mma hold your hand, that's for my ex to see
So bring the cameras out, that's for the rest to see
I ain't, scared to let them know what it is
So if they push up on me, I'mma turn to buss'
You my girl, you my world, you my heart, you my wheel
Picture us a couple cribs and a couple of kids
Yeah, no gas got plans for the future
No neutral, I hope the feeling's mutual
See, I'm nothin' like them lames that you used to
Keep it simple, open doors when I [?] you and more

[Verse 2 : AD]
You know it's yours and I know it's mine
So fine all the time, let me see you shine
So when you cover, you ain't neva gotta go in line
So just relax, enjoy yourself and let me blow your mind
No crime, I'm lovin' you with affection
I want your girls, gon' bring them all to the section
You got the wheel for real, fuck the prudence
And when we sexin', no need for protection
Cause you my bitch!
Bring scales when a nigga [?]
Love the feelin', I really nail
All the time and I really made it
I swear to God, girl I never [?]
Cause a house ain't really home unless a woman in it
And the money don't mean shit unless my woman spend it
So any chance you get to make to a woman, get it
And no decisions bein' made unless my woman with it
Yeah
