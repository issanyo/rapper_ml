[Hook]
They think I'm crazy
They don't wanna see me at all
Champagne dripping on the floor
Wipe it up, wipe it up, wipe it up

[Verse 1]
Me and my crew, we step up in the building
Got these bitches choosing, now you niggas feeling us
Me and my crew 'bout to go up baby
'Cause this is elevation and that Keisha got me feeling right
I ain't never trippin'
I got a glass and I hold it up while I'm sipping
Everybody's digging my song
DJ play it for me all night long

[Hook]
They think I'm crazy
They don't wanna see me at all
Champagne dripping on the floor
Wipe it up, wipe it up, wipe it up

[Verse 2]
Married to the game like I wiped it up
Shitting on these niggas, man, somebody come and wipe it up
Wipe it up, if you got that kush go ahead and light it up
Pass that bitch around until your eyelids start to tighten up

Look at me, I made it, nigga
Look at all this liquor, why you think I'm faded, nigga?
Niggas these groupies is in movies so I'm x rated, nigga
Molly at the club 'cause it pay to get her
Five racks, niggas take shots like Iraq
Niggas tryina sneak in my VIP, just so they could be where I'm at
My head swollen and my pocket swollen, I'm amped up so let's rock and roll
Ain't with none of that bullshit but I'm number one like I'm Derrick Rose
Your girl think I'm sexy, she wanna be misses McCall
I can tell that girl her freak is on so wipe it up

[Hook]
They think I'm crazy
They don't wanna see me at all
Champagne dripping on the floor
Wipe it up, wipe it up, wipe it up

[Outro]
Drank in my club, be your bitch, you're my bitch
