[Intro]
You're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Miss me when I'm gone
Your lips won't kiss mine anymore

[Verse 1]
Just got a condo down in DT LA
Just to feel like I was in NYC
And sometimes I wonder if I ever went away
Would my city miss a man like me?
Would my city miss a man like me?
Would my city miss a man like me?
Do they understand a man like me?
Do they understand a man like me?
What if I was to just up and leave
To the city that never sleeps?

[Chorus]
Traded a new pair of Js just so I can catch a plane
So I can catch a plane, I'm already on my way
I'll be NYC
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be NYC
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
And I'll be NYC
NYC

[Verse 2]
Just rolled a backwood on my balcony
Cause of comfort or misery
I seen a couple making love in the window in the drapes
Kind of love, you don't give a fuck who sees ya
Love is a two way street
Like this downtown was meant for me
Oneway, just like the one way I'm taking to NYC
[?]
Ain't no biggie 'bout these streets be dangerous
Always been right and never been afraid of us
No lil bitch, I ain't talking 'bout the 51
Taking straight shots like this non stop
Taking straight shots like this non stop
I'm in NYC
I'm in, I'm in NYC

[Chorus]
Traded a new pair of Js just so I can catch a plane
So I can catch a plane, I'm already on my way
I'll be NYC
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
I'll be NYC
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be
And I'll be NYC
NYC
