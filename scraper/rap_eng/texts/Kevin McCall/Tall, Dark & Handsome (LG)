[Chorus]
No actor but these stylists love me like I'm Lance Gross
Tall, dark and handsome, quit believing, supermodel
Lance Gross, Lance Gross, Lance Gross
Take you out that house of fame, move you in my condo
Lance Gross, Lance Gross, Lance Gross
Body picture perfect, we should touch you in my bedroom
So tall, dark and handsome, last name should be [?]
Better watch your girl, she on my hair like durags
Who that? Who that?
I'm no saint but trucker, NO
That's abbreviation for New Orleans though, though

[Verse 1]
I'm a square nigga if you call it square
Small circles, same faces
Yeah it took a lot of work, ain't just make it here
So misunderstood, let me make it clear
Make it up, 'bout to watch, I can make it anywhere
Hit the roof and cowards never visit here
Scored off in the city, swagging 'til I come, Lance Gross
Hit night like black light, might pull up bumping Cosbo music
Can't wait to see my comma on you baby

[Chorus]
No actor but these stylists love me like I'm Lance Gross
Tall, dark and handsome, quit believing, supermodel
Lance Gross, Lance Gross, Lance Gross
Take you out that house of fame, move you in my condo
Lance Gross, Lance Gross, Lance Gross
Body picture perfect, we should touch you in my bedroom
So tall, dark and handsome, last name should be [?]
Better watch your girl, she on my hair like durags
Who that? Who that?
I'm no saint but trucker, NO
That's abbreviation for New Orleans though, though

[Verse 2]
I'm a square nigga if you call it square
Small circles, same faces
Yeah it took a lot of work, ain't just make it here
So misunderstood, let me make it clear
Make it up, 'bout to watch, I can make it anywhere
Hit the roof and cowards never visit here
Scored off in the city, swagging 'til I come, Lance Gross
Hit night like black light, might pull up bumping Cosbo music
