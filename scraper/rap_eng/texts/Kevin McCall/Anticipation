[Verse 1]

Girl when we're fuckin
My heart is beating like 100 miles an hour
Your body drippin
I got her lookin like you hopped out the shower yeah
You got that bomb
I got your panties falling like the Twin Towers
So imagine what it's gonna be like
When I really get it
Imagine what it's gonna feel like
When I really hit it
Imagine what it's gonna feel like
When I finally get you what you've been waiting for
For whoa
Ain't at it yet but I already want more

I know that you can't wait til I lay you down
But waiting is the best part oh na na
Anticipation oh na na
Anticipation oh yeah ahaa

No need for rushing
Go in the touching
Imma have your body trembling
The way I've been beating like it's a drum
You're gonna want to call me Timbaland yeah
She said let me get you like I'm out the dresser
Before you go away
Father forgive me for all my sins
But it feels like I got heaven in my hands whoa
You can't rush perfection girl noo ooh
