[Pre-hook]
It's no fun with you alone
But it's too early to move on
And no one wants to start all over, start all over
Unless it's me and you

[Hook]
I dont wanna start all over
Start all over, start all over
Start all over, start all over, start all over
Imma make you fall in love
Like the first time
Imma make you fall in love
Like the first time
Start all over, start all over, start all over

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I know you're lonely
And when you get cold at night
I know your body
I know the way you like it
Just say the word
And i'm coming over
To make you feel right, yeah
And we gon' get it right, yeah

[Pre-hook] + [Hook]

[Bridge] 2x
I wake up every morning thinkin' bout you
My head down and i think about you
Can't live without you
Why would i want to?
