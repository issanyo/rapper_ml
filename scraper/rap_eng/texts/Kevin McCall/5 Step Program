[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Treasure Davis]
I wanna rock to the music, don't wanna stop
Wanna get lost in the feeling, no holding back, letting go
I wanna rock to the music, don't wanna stop
Wanna get lost in the feeling, no holding back, letting go
Hit you with the 5 step program
Let me show you how you 'posed to slow down
Introduction to the romance
Let the DJ play another soul jam
5 step program
Let me show you how you 'posed to slow down
Introduction to the romance
Let the DJ play another soul jam

[Verse 1: Treasure Davis]
Look at the time, almost a quarter to 3
I'm getting tired, boy are you staying with me?
Boy you got me saying what if
Quit downtown but I ain't really tryna go there
Unless you really tryna go there
That talk baby, that'll get you nowhere

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Treasure Davis]
I wanna rock to the music, don't wanna stop
Wanna get lost in the feeling, no holding back, letting go
I wanna rock to the music, don't wanna stop
Wanna get lost in the feeling, no holding back, letting go

[Verse 2: Kevin McCall]
I'mma swoop you up
Tell your man sorry, don't mean to interrupt
I scooped you up in a 'rari cause girl I'm in a rush
I'm tryna head to the club, cut a rug or something
Follow these 5 steps for me
Slow dancing while our favourite song playing

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Treasure Davis]
I wanna rock to the music, don't wanna stop
Wanna get lost in the feeling, no holding back, letting go
I wanna rock to the music, don't wanna stop
Wanna get lost in the feeling, no holding back, letting go

[Bridge: Kevin McCall]
Now repeat steps 1 to 5 with me
I don't give a damn about who sees
What we do while we on this dance floor
It's me and you, love
Now repeat steps 1 to 5 with me
I don't give a damn about who sees
What we do while we on this dance floor
It's me and you, love

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Treasure Davis]
I wanna rock to the music, don't wanna stop
Wanna get lost in the feeling, no holding back, letting go
I wanna rock to the music, don't wanna stop
Wanna get lost in the feeling, no holding back, letting go
