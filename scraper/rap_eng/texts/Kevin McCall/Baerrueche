[Verse 1]
Still got your number in my wallet
Your Insta, your BlackBerry Messenger
Coulda swore I threw those things away
Lately he wanna call you babe, so ironic
Cause back in the day you was calling me

[Hook]
You know this ain't no bullshit, yeah
Ain't tryna run no game
I'm only tryna make you bae
Me and you should make a pretty black and Asian baby
And name him Tyson McCall
Make another, judge this on molly
Bae, bae

[Verse 2]
Still got your number in my wallet
Your Insta, your BlackBerry Messenger
Coulda swore I threw those things away
Lately he wanna call you babe
Cause back in the day you was calling me, so ironic

[Hook]
You know this ain't no bullshit, yeah
You can't wait to call her bae, yeah
Be afraid, call her bae
Be afraid, be afraid
To say what you mean and mean what you say
Don't be afraid to call her bae
Be afraid, be afraid
Call her bae, call her bae
