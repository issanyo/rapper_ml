Verse 1:

Now I'm thinking of ways
Thinking of ways
Thinking of ways
I wanna go about this

I'm still missin your face member the days you use to say
Boy I ain't going no where no

Thinking of ways
Thinking of ways
Can't find love on google maps
I need that new WAYZ app

Thinking of ways
Thinking of ways
Thinking of ways
To lovers Lane

(Hook)

I gotta find my way to lovers lane
Still trying to find my way to lovers lane
Tell me how a love so real
Turned around and went all downhill
We were supposed to go up from here
Turned arounda nd went all downhill

Verse 2:

If love is a one-way street  I'll catch a one way because I live in DTLA I still stay with purple and gold it's no wonder I grew up with the Lakers play
I've been taking cougars down you can ask around
Since mothers weekend at Washington state
If Clark let Lois keep her maiden name she probably named the baby lovers Lane

2nd verse:

Broken wounds and scars take time to heal but at least the stars don't seem so far from here
Wish you were here
Daddy's little child where have you been something just don't feel right says mommy LEFT

(Bridge)

Now when it goes downhill meditate and it gets easier I know it's dark now but it'll get brighter in the morning

Rap Verse:

First time I heard him say you was on sunset with Wale
Swear to God I really thought you was on sunset with Wale
Pulled up dolo no Van Peebles or "Posse"
Found out by then it was just a intro or something well

G's move in silence end of D...
If you thought that was a break let me translate end of discussion Usually don't be on Marco Polo
Looking for you in the daytime with the lights on

With the lights on make another Marley with the lights off or another pretty Jenesis MacCall
You can tells "I da Pappy"
Fuck a Maury show

We used to wrestle til your sheets would smell like my creed cologne Get my Mike B. Jordan on beat it up cameras record
I can't stand it when you leak your own nude photos
What do I tell my baby when she gets older?
