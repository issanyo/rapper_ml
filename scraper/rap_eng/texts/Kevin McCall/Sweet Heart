[Verse 1]
Sweetheart, when the sunlight's on your face
I hope that faith can have its way today
Sweetheart, it's like I'm drifting on the stars
Know you're in a rush and my love's on the way

[Pre-Chorus]
And I love that you are everything I want
And if you need anything from me, you can just ask me
Cause your touch does something to me baby
Cause you're my greatest gift, I seal it with a kiss and I just wanna tell you that you are

[Chorus]
A sweetheart is what you are
I said a sweetheart is what you are, you are wonderful
Sweetheart is what you are, oh na na, oh na na
Sweetheart, sweetheart

[Verse 2]
If I could take all the girls around the world and put them in a room, oh woah
None of them could compare to you, oh woah
And I put together all the pieces
Only thing that's missing is you yeah, is you yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I love that you are everything I want
And if you need anything from me, you can just ask me
Cause your touch does something to me baby
Cause you're my greatest gift, I seal it with a kiss and I just wanna tell you that you are

[Chorus]
A sweetheart is what you are
I said a sweetheart is what you are, you are wonderful
Sweetheart is what you are, oh na na, oh na na
Sweetheart, sweetheart

[Bridge]
Wind in your hair and the scent of your perfume girl
Nothing compares to you, to you
And I'm in paradise, you look so good in my eyes
Itâ€™s not a mirage right in front of me, you're not, you're not, you are the real thing
Hands up, for your love, if you really really love somebody body
Hands up, for your love, if you really really love somebody body
I said put your hands up, for your love, if you really really love somebody body
And I can see that it's more to what you are girl, baby you are

[Chorus]
A sweetheart is what you are
I said a sweetheart is what you are, you are wonderful
Sweetheart is what you are, oh na na, oh na na
Sweetheart, sweetheart

[Outro]
Wind in your hair and the scent of your perfume girl
Nothing compares to you, to you
And I'm in paradise, you look so good in my eyes
It's not a mirage right in front of me, you are the real thing
