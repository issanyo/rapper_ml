Don’t Know Me
Written By: Daven Wilson

[Verse 1: Daven]
Make it another day
Make it another round
Maybe get knocked down
But never knocked out

And all the recent decisions
By people in my division
Makes me wonder if my intellect
Points me in a different direction

No doubt
I’m just countin sounds
Boom, clap, pow
Seven seconds between thunderclouds

It’s been a minute since
I’ve been cruising and winnin
But behind the scenes I wanted to
Let the plot thicken

This is the storyline
And I’m the story-teller
I’m what the stories bout
This how the stories delivered

And if you listen in closely
You’ll recover the message
I placed deep within the lyrical content
Of this selection

Yeah
I’m a poet at heart
I like how you don’t even know me
Till you tear me apart

Then when I’m bleeding with the blood dark
You say I’m human
Never would have guessed from the start
Life of a star

[Chorus]
Don’t come here with that negativity
Cause we ain’t got time for that
And if your homies friends and family wanna do the same thing
Tell em' we ain’t got time for that

Cause I don’t know you
And you don’t know me

So

Why you acting phony
Yeah you gotta be joking
Acting all chummy with company
But you know you don’t know me

[Verse 2: Daven]
Whatcha doing at my crib
Actin like this where you live
Why when I’m out you shouting Daven
For the attention

Why am I finding it
So hard to believe you anymore
Maybe its because
You don’t keep it real anymore

Man this ridiculous
I been sick of it
Your fake friendship
I took it and got rid of it

Free and clear to do
Whatever I please
But here we go again
I’m hearing talkin in the streets

Sayin I'm a this and a that
Well it got back
If I’m a this and that
Well let me show you how that acts

SMACK SMACK
I’m not gonna hit you
It’s a metaphoric thing
That’s probably to advanced dude

Lets think of something different
Something to make a difference
How bout' tellin you your girl was into me
Before you man

Matter fact let me put you in a rap
Say hello to this track
Now roll it up
Cause that’s a wrap!

[Chorus]
Don’t come here with that negativity
Cause we ain’t got time for that
And if your homies friends and family wanna do the same thing
Tell em' we ain’t got time for that

Cause I don’t know you
And you don’t know me

So

Why you acting phony
Yeah you gotta be joking
Acting all chummy with company
But you know you don’t know me

[Bridge: Daven]
Haters talking to me like
We friends
Always wanting something
I’m like you don’t really know me man

Like you don’t
You don’t, you don’t, you don’t
You know
You don’t, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t

Girls doing tricks
And guys thinking they it
But they all don’t know me
That’s the truth, legit

Like you don’t
You don’t, you don’t, you don’t
You know
You don’t, you don’t, you don’t, you don’t

Hey!

[Chorus]
Don’t come here with that negativity
Cause we ain’t got time for that
And if your homies friends and family wanna do the same thing
Tell em' we ain’t got time for that

Cause I don’t know you
And you don’t know me

So

Why you acting phony
Yeah you gotta be joking
Acting all chummy with company
But you know you don’t know me
