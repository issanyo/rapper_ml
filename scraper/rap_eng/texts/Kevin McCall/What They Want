[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
These niggas mad, they mugging me
I like my pussy bald, Mr. Clean
She started waxing, my dick relaxing
I make her bed rock, call me the mattress king
She got a sick body, I'm like her vaccine
Come to think about it, Vitamin D
Her ass up out them jeans, but keep your heels on
The bedroom, yeah that's the kill zone
It's Young Money baby and it's CBE
Let my name spell it out CMB
Haters don't bother me, blogs swallow these
Oops, now watch that beat on TMZ
Breezy bitch you know it's me, your girl wetter than Poland Springs
So I go deeper under water, submarine
Now let me dive-in, head first
Yeah I'm a nice guy, but I'm a grown motherfucker

[Chorus: Tyga & Chris Brown]
All of these bitches in the party, these niggas fuck with me
But I don't fuck with nobody
I pull up in the back bitches waiting in the lobby
Come here, let me show you, do it like I'm 'posed to nigga
I'm what they want, I'm what they want
I'm what they want, I'm what they want
I'm what they want, I'm what they want
Come here let me show you, do it how I'm supposed to, nigga

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Hot damn ho, yeah I'm going in
Pussy poppers want me to eat it, then sister get it trim
Show me tits, grown men, I don't fool around with kids
Rob Kelly, tell her piss me up 100 bid
Cash Money in this bitch, Young Money in your bizz
Fuck around with that label, yellow labels on your ribs
That's the shit them niggas get, homie, bitches bend they ribs
One time for the shottas, black hogs on them choppers, bitch
Shit sound sick, water flow drowned bitch
Oh you smoke that seed a lot, my niggas on pounds bitch
We don't hit the club a lot, we be in them lounges
With them girls 5'10" front cover Vogue shit, bitch

[Chorus: Tyga & Chris Brown]
All of these bitches in the party, these niggas fuck with me
But I don't fuck with nobody
I pull up in the back bitches waiting in the lobby
Come here, let me show you, do it like I'm 'posed to nigga
I'm what they want, I'm what they want
I'm what they want, I'm what they want
I'm what they want, I'm what they want
Come here let me show you, do it how I'm supposed to, nigga
All of these bitches in the party, these niggas fuck with me
But I don't fuck with nobody
I pull up in the back bitches waiting in the lobby
Come here, let me show you, do it like I'm 'posed to nigga
I'm what they want, I'm what they want
I'm what they want, I'm what they want
I'm what they want, I'm what they want
Come here let me show you, do it how I'm supposed to, nigga
