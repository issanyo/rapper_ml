[Verse 1]
You would think I was addicted to 'shrooms
I live on the moon
I'm fly than a motherfucker
You still in your cocoon
All I want you to assume is your favourite position
Came in the room when I hit it
You can feel it, all up in your ribs
Then your body go numb 'til you can't feel shit
Enough being nasty
I done had enough of walking round like I'm happy
I done let a lot of precious time go past me
Never give a pawn opposition of a cap, bitch
I don't mean no yes man, no yes man
I'm fresh man, balling like a true freshman
This you blow is my wrist band
I stay dressed in that Topman
Top models my girlfriends
Top down, going top speed
On the 110, god damn
I can't believe there's really niggas out here like
Oh no, K-Mac took my bitch and K-Mac fucked my bitch
Sir, that is a lie, I did not fuck your bitch
She fucked me

[Hook]
I can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up
I found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up
Rich niggas don't do that
Last time I checked, only bitch niggas do that
I can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up
I found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up
Rich niggas don't do that
Last time I checked, only bitch niggas do that

[Verse 2]
Who that? I seen 'em in boxes
I seen 'em in YGF man, this fit game was popping
That nigga was stylish, I'm just being honest
I'm fucking amazing and fly as a pilot, that's just me being too fucking modest
No matter what nigga, I'm shining regardless
Too much a real nigga, sometimes I wish I was heartless
I wish I was heartless, sometimes I wish I was heartless
I reach for the light, but I live in the darkness

[Hook]
I can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up
I found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up
Rich niggas don't do that
Last time I checked, only bitch niggas do that
I can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up
I found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up
Rich niggas don't do that
Last time I checked, only bitch niggas do that

[Verse 3]
This song ain't directed at nobody in particular, you know
If the shoes fit, word Cinderella
You know I'm with the shits
Settle down, no fella
The jock, 2013
AKA, the ladies love 'em
AKA, he know you fine
Fuck you want me to do?

[Hook]
I can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up
I found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up
Rich niggas don't do that
Last time I checked, only bitch niggas do that
I can't believe these niggas tryna fuck my money up
I found out this bitch tryna fuck my money up
Rich niggas don't do that
Last time I checked, only bitch niggas do that
