[Verse 1]
For quite a while I was in denial
But now I realise there ain't no hiding how I feel from ya
I swear without you girl
I should be locked away, oh yeah

[Hook]
Cause you drive me crazy
Going insane, baby, yeah
If I go crazy
You're to the one to blame, oh

[Verse 2]
See it finally hit me, yeah, girl I feel it 150, yeah
But it's alright, all the kissing, touching, freaking, love it yeah
Never be sedated but without your love
Baby I would rather lose my god damn mind, yeah
Say it's got a hold on me and it won't let me scream
And I can't get your voice out of my dreams, baby
Stay, don't you take your loving away
Cause your loving's got such a hold on me

[Hook]
You drive me crazy
Going insane, baby, yeah
If I go crazy
You're to the one to blame, oh
