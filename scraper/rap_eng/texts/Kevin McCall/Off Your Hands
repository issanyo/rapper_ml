(Verse 1:)
Excuse me
I don't wanna mean to be rude, see
But you kinda treat her like a groupie
But I'm gonna make her feel like a star
Ooh!
You're choosin'
But you don't realize what you're losin'
Gonna put her up with some new shit
Will you follow me to the bar?

(Chorus 1:)
She can stay with you
All night long
But she's giving me the eye
Sleep with you
All night long
But she was sure it was I
I can tell you: think your way to fly

(Chorus 2:)
So let me take that off your hands
Cause I'm gonna do something weird
I got it, but you just don't get it
I do!
Let me take that off your hands
Cause you got a lover there, waitin'
Lookin like she needs some savin'
Thum-ta-da-da!
If I take it off your hands
Don't expect to fall gone
She's tired and she's long gone
So let me take that off your hands
You should have appreciated her
I'm gonna just please her later
Later
Let me take that off your hands

(Verse 2:)
She's already feelin' brand new
You ain't never really had a clue
How to make her show that freaky side to you
I'll be
Hopping all over her body
It's better that you know where I'll be
I'll be...

(Chorus 1:)
She can stay with you
All night long
But she's giving me the eye
Sleep with you
All night long
But she was sure it was I
I can tell you: think your way to fly

(Chorus 2:)
So let me take that off your hands
Cause I'm gonna do something weird
I got it, but you just don't get it
I do!
Let me take that off your hands
Cause you got a lover there, waitin'
Lookin like she needs some savin'
Thum-ta-da-da!
If I take it off your hands
Don't expect to fall gone
She's tired and she's long gone
So let me take that off your hands
You should have appreciated her
I'm gonna just please her later
Later
Let me take that off your hands

(Verse 3:)
We could have the best sex ever
Let her roll with me
I can give her what she needs
We could have the best sex ever
I'm gonna give her what she likes
Even if it takes all night

(Chorus 2:)
So let me take that off your hands
Cause I'm gonna do something weird
I got it, but you just don't get it
I do!
Let me take that off your hands
Cause you got a lover there, waitin'
Lookin like she needs some savin'
Thum-ta-da-da!
If I take it off your hands
Don't expect to fall gone
She's tired and she's long gone
So let me take that off your hands
You should have appreciated her
I'm gonna just please her later
Later
Let me take that off your hands
