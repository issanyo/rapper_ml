[Chorus]
(Ohh, ahh)
I'm not all in my feelings, just tellin' you how I feel
(Ohh, ahh)
'Cause I got caught up in a moment, tell me where you wanna take it from here
(Ohh, ahh)
Ohh
'Cause I'm ready for whatever
(Ohh, ahh)
('Cause I'm ready for whatever)
'Cause I'm ready for whatever

[Verse 1]
Let me know so I could make a move
I don't want just a dose of you
I prefer to have it all, whatever we wanna call it
I ain't worried 'bout no other bitches
Fell in love with me before the riches
Shit is cool when we're together
Me and you don't get no better

[Chorus]
(Ohh, ahh)
I'm not all in my feelings, just tellin' you how I feel
(Ohh, ahh)
'Cause I got caught up in a moment, tell me where you wanna take it from here
(Ohh, ahh)
Ohh
'Cause I'm ready for whatever
(Ohh, ahh)
('Cause I'm ready for whatever)
'Cause I'm ready for whatever

[Verse 2]
It's whatev-whatever
I'm not one to show feelings, 'cause I gotta keep it trill
Ohhh
But if you asked, I'd say yes, 'cause you already know the deal
You know the deal we could try if you want
Do this right now if you say it's a go
You know things nobody will ever know
In the bed already know you a pro (I know)
Either we both ain't gotta say shit
Or tell me where you wanna take it

[Chorus]
(Ohh, ahh)
I'm not all in my feelings, just tellin' you how I feel
(Ohh, ahh)
'Cause I got caught up in a moment, tell me where you wanna take it from here
(Ohh, ahh)
Ohh
'Cause I'm ready for whatever
(Ohh, ahh)
('Cause I'm ready for whatever)
'Cause I'm ready for whatever

[Outro]
It's whatev-whatever
'Cause I'm ready for whatever
It's whatev-whatever
'Cause I'm ready for whatever
