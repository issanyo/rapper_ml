[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Baby wanna take
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Plan A didn't work, now it's time to go to work
You're the plan I don't wanna see, now we're back at plan B
I ain't come to play games, now you running from the D
We gon' get it in, I'ma leave it in

[Chorus]
You don't need a plan B
You don't need a plan B
You don't need a plan B
No, woah
You ain't gotta say nothing, hear your body calling me
Real Gs move in silence, know you heard about me
Woah, yeah, yeah, you don't need a plan B
Ooh, woah
You don't need a plan B
You don't need a plan B
You don't need a plan B
No, woah

[Verse]
Gold chains like I'm Mr. T
Fuck a plan B, I'm on the A-Team
She climb on top, now she facin' me
Shots to the head, ain't no chaser
I kill that pussy like Jason
Freddy Krueger nails on my back
Show me what great is, yeah

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta say nothing, hear your body calling me
Real Gs move in silence, know you heard about me
Woah, yeah, yeah, you don't need a plan B
Ooh, woah
Ooh, woah
You don't need a plan B
You don't need a plan B
You don't need a plan B
No, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
Plan A didn't work, now it's time to go to work
You're the plan I don't wanna see, now we're back at plan B
I ain't come to play games, now you running from the D
We gon' get it in, I'ma leave it in

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta say nothing, hear your body calling me
Real Gs move in silence, know you heard about me
Woah, yeah, yeah, you don't need a plan B
