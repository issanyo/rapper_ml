[Verse 1]
Can you ride on it? Can you grind on it like BMX?
Ain't worried 'bout my BM, forgot about my ex
If the kiddy brandy, let the dogs out like DMX
I heard it's fire, but tonight girl, you gon' meet your match
You gon' spin around, girl, you gon' go up and down on it
Know how to please it, proud, girl that's my number, phone for me
I know you wanna grind, now let me see you grind on it
Girl, I can't even lie, I wanna make you my one and only

[Chorus]
Stay up cause show you that if you ready babe
1,2, you ain't gotta leave, no
Girl, I want you to stay
Lay up and just think, all these sex games we make

[Verse 2]
Love for lil mama to stay, promise I will never skate
First place since the first day, you should have my last name
Wood grinding on my wood grain
Girl, it seems like you ready
It's easy, you don't even need no practice
I'mma pick you up and tryna keep my balance
But first, we gotta get you out that outfit
It's sexy but you sexier without it, yeah

[Chorus]
Here we are, coming around again
Up and down, round and round again
Up and down, know I love that shit
Sex games, sex games with you
That's all I wanna do
That's all I wanna do to you
It's all I wanna do
You're all I wanna do

[Verse 3]
Love for lil mama to stay, promise I will never skate
First place since the first day, you should have my last name
Wood grinding on my wood grain
Girl, it seems like you ready
It's easy, you don't even need no practice
I'mma pick you up and tryna keep my balance
But first, we gotta get you out that outfit
It's sexy but you sexier without it, yeah
