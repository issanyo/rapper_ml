[Verse 1]
Wrote him a goodbye letter today
With conviction in every stroke, licked the envelope, and sent it away
Wanted to do it the old fashioned way
Didn't want no textin' and
Tweetin'
Want him to feel every word that I say

[Chorus]
Boy, I hope these tears I've cried on the paper dont dry before it make it to your side (your side)
I want you to know what it feels like (feels like, feels like)
When your heart is done I'm so tired (so tired, so tired)
I hope when he reads these words
This hurt I feel bleeds through before the ink dries (ink dries)
I want you to know what it feels like (feels like, feels like)
When your heart is done I'm so tired (so tired, so tired)
(So I need you to)

Hurry, Hurry please, Mr, Mailman
Overnight if you can
I need you to feel me feel me
This is a special delivery livery

Ohhhhh

Hurry, Hurry now before I take it back
Before he cleans up his act
I need you to feel me, feel me
This is a special delivery livery

[Verse 2]
Funny how words take a life on their own
When you said you loved me
That's what I believe but I was so wrong, baby
Boy in your arms I never felt more alone
But now that I got me back
Got my heart on track
And I'm moving on

[Chorus]
Boy, I hope these tears I've cried on the paper dont dry before it make it to your side (your side)
I want you to know what it feels like (feels like, feels like)
When your heart is done I'm so tired (so tired, so tired)
I hope when he reads these words
This hurt I feel bleeds through before the ink dries (ink dries)
I want you to know what it feels like (feels like, feels like)
When your heart is done I'm so tired (so tired, so tired)

(So I need you to)

Hurry, Hurry please, Mr. Mailman
Overnight if you can
I need you to feel me feel me
This is a special delivery livery

Ohhhh...

Hurry, Hurry now before I take it back
Before he cleans up his act
I need you to feel me feel me
This is a special delivery livery

Got me saying woaahhhhhhh
Special delivery
