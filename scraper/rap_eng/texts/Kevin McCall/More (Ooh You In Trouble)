[Verse 1: Mila J]
You on top of me and we ain't gotta creep with it
If I wake you up, you gon' want to fall asleep in it
Cause we on some grown, diamonds and Hennessy shit
Diamonds and Hennessy shit
Wetting the bed, breaking the headboards
We go so hard
Face to the mirror, legs to the ceiling
You know it's mine

[Pre-Chorus: Mila J]
Baby got me leaning like it's 1996
Bounce it up and down like a 64 Impala, hiting all my switches
Ride it like a rodeo then take a ride down Rodeo

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Mila J]
Cause I just want more
Cause I just want, I just want more
I just want more, I just want more
I just want more, more
Make me say oh
Make me say oh
Make me say oh
Make me say oh

[Verse 2: Mila J]
Don't need a reason, could be 8 in the morning when I need that baby
You got me, ain't no stopping
Long hair, get a handful
Breaking my back, you got me cumming for you
Any time that he need that and I got that, I'm running
Break it down like a swisha and he like the way that I'm rolling
You got that nasty shit that you know that I like
You keep me climbing all night, for more

[Pre-Chorus: Mila J]
Baby got me leaning like it's 1996
Bounce it up and down like a 64 Impala, hiting all my switches
Ride it like a rodeo then take a ride down Rodeo

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Mila J]
Cause I just want more
Cause I just want, I just want more
I just want more, I just want more
I just want more, more
Make me say oh
Make me say oh
Make me say oh
Make me say oh

[Verse 3: Kevin McCall]
What did the loving, came out and stopped
Look what we got and you got to drop it
Ooh you in trouble, ooh and I love it
Why you in trouble, ain't letting you go
Knowing tonight, ain't getting this 'til you leave
And I'm rocking to the beat, baby

[Chorus: Kevin McCall & Mila J]
Cause I just want more
Cause I just want, I just want more
I just want more, I just want more
I just want more, more
Make me say oh
Make me say oh
Make me say oh
Make me say oh
