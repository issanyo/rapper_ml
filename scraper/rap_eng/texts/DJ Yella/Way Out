[Chorus]
This jam is way out, way out
You fake MC's are on your way out
Way out
Too bad you're on your way out

[Verse 1]
This is a way out jam (jam)
For some way out girls (girls)
The ones that are constantly
Rocking your world

With the hyper cuts (cuts)
And the slamming beats  (beats)
That make you other girls sound oh so weak

But that's O.K
We know how it is
J.J. Fad reigns supreme in the rapping biz

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I've got something to say
(What?)
I'm kinda mad
(Oh yeah?)
This is coming from
The one and only J.J. Fad

You may try to bag (bag)
You may try to diss (diss)
That just lets us know who's running this

Yeah
We're getting stupid (stupid)
And there's no doubt
That this here jam
Is just so way out

[Repeat Chorus]

Sassy

[Verse 3]
We're busting the charts (charts)
Every week
And we'll stay on top
And you know that we are freaks

We're here to please (please)
So get on your knees (knees)
And pray to be like us
Before you take your Z's

We have a classy style (style)
That's worth your while
So sit back and relax
And let us get you riled

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Now that you know
What we're talking about
(Say what?)
Then you too can be way out

The W is for wild
The A is amazing
The Y is for you suckas that are perpetrating
The O is for outstanding
And the U is for unique
The T is for too bad
Your jam is so, so weak

[Repeat Chorus]
