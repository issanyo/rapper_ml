[Verse 1: B.G. Knocc Out]
Rolling in my hood, twisted on these D's
Age 19 and I'm moving straight keys
Me and my B.G.'s, baby gangstas
Putting it down right because we don't allow pranksters
Hoes come through, looking fly and all fine
And I know in their mind, all they see is dollar signs
So there for yo, I might met to a hoe
Wait 'til nightfall and take her ass to the mo-mo
Blaze up some indo, sip up a little 8-ball
5 minutes later, I'm all up in them drizzos
Knockin' down them Wizzos, with my bulldozer
When I'm ready to switch I'll tell the girl to bend over
Do a little smacking, flipping and then I'm through
Tell her to give me a call sometimes, tomorrow around 2
It's now 2 o'clock and she hit me on the hip
But I can't call her back cause I'm trying to stack my grip
Home-girl might trip the next time that she see me
Messing around to get herself slapped by the B.G
I'm not a women disser but still I ain't giving
Up a damn thing, cause bitch, that's how I'm livin'

[Hook: Marlon White]
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin in 9-6
(Yeah, for 9-6 yah)
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
Ooooohhh yeaahh

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Before the brother was rapping
The brother was straight robbing
Gaffling up my name was like a part time jobbing
I did it cause that's all I knew
I dropped out the school in the 8th grade
Cause I was going through a straight faze
Living foul as a child back in the days
Until I find out, that the crime does not pay
At age 13 I went to juvenile hog
And on the inside they treat the nigga like a dog
So being locked down really ain't the lick
They get to tell the nigga when sleep, eat, and shhh
Man fuck that, I'd rather be free out in the streets
Getting paid everyday and straight chilling with my peas
Be able to sleep and eat, when and where I wanna
Hanging with my niggas tossing 40's on the corner
Now I'm on wax, kicking straight gangsterism
Letting niggas know in '96
Cause yo, that's how I'm livin'

[Hook: Marlon White]
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
(Yeah, for 9-6 yah)
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
Ooooohhh yeaahh

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Now I see there's more to life than just banging
Flying state to state on the plane entertaining
The world, rockin' shows, knockin' those, everywhere I go
Everybody know K.O
And uh damn it feels good to make it out the hood
And be some body like I had always said I would
But though I'm still starving, no more drive-bying
The streets get worse but still the brother keeps trying
To be the best I can, with no time to waste
And since I went straight, I keep the smile on my mama's face
Now I'm a father, I strap a little harder
June 19th of 93 out comes my daughter
Sometimes I get a blur and think about doing dirt
But I checked myself and put my focus in her
That's how I'm livin'

[Hook: Marlon White]
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
(Yeah, for 9-6 yah)
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
Ooooohhh yeaahh
I'm letting you know
