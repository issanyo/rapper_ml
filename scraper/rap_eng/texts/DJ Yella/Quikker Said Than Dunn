[Verse 1: DJ Quik]
My name is Quik yeah this is true
Keepin' your attention is what I'm gonna do
Hardcore yo I could never be soft
Askin' me my defin' they say the boy goes off
Fillin' up my memo with the touch of my rhyme
Suckaz stayin' with me cause they know the time
Quiet on the set because I'm about to begin
And if you didn't hear me boy I'll tell you again
My name is Quik or just call me Q
But It doesn't really matter to you
Cause I'm the same person
Whether serious or rehearsin' I just gotta keep cursin'
This is for the radio so I better chill
They won't play it if I co get ill
But I'm like that and thats an actually fact
Because the street is where my heart is at
Yo I don't do dope but I'm dope not a dope
But I'm doper than anybody who trys to cope
If the rhyme I'm dispayin'
And the beat thats playin'
Yo you could try all day
And you still won't match up with the Ruthless P.O.W
Cause Quik's doin it Compton style
Thats the city and you say you could get some yo
It's Quik-er Said Than Dunn

[Chorus]
Wooooooo! Wooooooo!

[Verse 2: DJ Quik]
They made it easy for me to get my point across
So listen up close if ya don't ya might get lost
I'm not a role model nore a Dr. Seuss
But i'm not a gangsta and I'm about to get stupid
I guess its time for the trama
With the Q-U-I-K comma
Now thats drama so pay attention
By the way I must mention I'm comin' off hard in the third dimension
With the glare but you don't need no glasses to stare
It'll probably take you in and it's just like your there
With the Q on the Compton tip
So if you think I'm a flip or slip don't even trip
Cause I'm a destroyer
My homie Theo is a dj not a lawyer dope fly employer
On the (static) thats my station
To get the money, the women, while we dippin round tha nation
Boy, Mister Quiks of toys
I mean str8 while ya suckin' with the girls enjoy
You must be sick or ya lonely
How ya gone still my name if ya don't even know me
(Dj Quik: Blak Tone) (Blak Tone: What sup)
Get the gat show 'em where it's at and that's just the sound and next time
I'm peelin ya cap to let ya know where I'm comin' from
Quik said it and it shall Be Dunn

[Chorus]
Wooooooo! Wooooooo!

[Verse 3: DJ Quik]
Creatin dope jams are the part of the cycle
Quik-er said than dunn yeah thats the title
Rubbin' the lady's only the fly ones ya know
(Blak Tone: but would if she's ugly) If she come she a ho
Don't ask to battle me home boy
What's that you wanna battle me boy
Ya better be strapped cause where I'm from it ain't all about that playin'
(*gun shots*) now that's what I'm sayin'
Sevy thought that I was born in '73
Now everybody want's to know the A-G-E
Girls on the tip fellaz too it seemed
Had everybody thinkin' I was only 15
The fellaz would annoy me the ladyz would adore me
And what was I to do I wishin' nothin' ladies do
Cause the ladiez I luv 'em nice and then soft
I hate male groupies so just step the hell off
I'm the real Quikster cause others be fakin'
Tryin' to game fame off the name I'm makin'
Sayin' on your records you could get some
Yo home boy its Quik-er Said Than Dunn

[Outro: DJ Quik]
Just a Quik Dedication
To the creator of Gangsta Rap music
Mr. Eric Eazy E Wright
That's how its done

[Chorus]
Wooooooo! Wooooooo!
