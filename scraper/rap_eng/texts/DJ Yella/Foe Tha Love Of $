[Jewell:] For the love of money!

[Hook]
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now

[Verse 1: Flesh-N-Bone]
Gotta get on the grind, pop in the clip of my 9
And, bitch, if you slip, you hit the chalk
And fall in the night time, gotta get mine
Ain't takin' no shorts or no losses, hop on the phone
Call up my nigga, sittin' at home
Polishin' that MAC-10 chrome
Got a lick we can hit, so bring yo' shit
'Cause once again it's on
To the dome with a fifth of Bourb'
My wig to the curb, so we swerve and rolled out
To pick up the triple six thug
And follow the murder for robbin' the dopehouse
Smoke up outta me bong, so high
Now comin' to slay with four grenades and a gauge
I'ma play, watch all 'em fall in their grave and lay
Pullin' in the driveway
Wish spotted the place and quickly rolled up
Bulldozed through the livin' room
Hopped out of the car and started to blow up
Buck buck and a kaboom
And blew all them bodies all over the room
Them doomed, and gotta move fast, why?
The po-po's comin', snatch up me yummy
So, nigga, don't think it's funny
I'm comin' up quick in the nine-quat
'Cause Flesh be lovin' this money

[Verse 2: Layzie Bone]
I'm given up love to the hustlers, all them St. Clair thugstas
Makin' that money, stayin' on your feet
And you better believe, gotta have that cheese
For the green leaves, never catch me sleep
Steady on the grind, get mine
Stayin' down for mine crime, and I hit up the nine-nine
Givin' up that yayo
Makin' me sale twenties, nickles, and dimes
Beat up and stick up a lick up, that two-eleven
Gotta get what's mine, then bailin'
Me kickin' up dust, I'm trailin', feelin', 187
That's how it is, and I gotsta have it in the nine-quat
Mission to check a mill
And still be real, thuggin' on the Glock-Glock
Creepin' on a come up, won't sleep 'til I'm done up
Gotta blaze me a blunt up
Hunt up another plot and scheme
Gotta make some green, 'cause soldiers nut up
What up? Gotta get that business on
Even though the Buddha run me, stun me
Feelin' lovely, but I'm just in it for the love of the money

[Hook]
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Standin' on the corner, straight slangin' rocks
Aw shit! Here comes the muthafuckin' cops!
So I dash, I ducks, and I hides behind a tree
Makin' sure the motherfuckers don't see me
Now my fat sack of rocks, hell yeah, I stuffed 'em
Police on my drawers, I had to pause
And yeah, it's still muthafuck 'em
Now my game is tight, tight as fuck is my game
Eazy-motherfuckin'-E, or Eric Wright, it's all the same
Now niggas might trip on how I stacks my grip
I got to have it, bitch, for the love of this shit, MOTHERFUCKER!

[Hook]
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now
Gotta make that money, man
It's still the same now

[Verse 4: Bizzy Bone]
When dough got me thugsta
Thuggish ways, down for my crime everytime
Follow me down the nine-nine
And you will find all of me kind
Check out the ripsta, now drop down
Run 'em up outta me hood
Rip's straight when makin' me grip witha me click
Rollin' with Ruthless, the thug I be
Me put 'em in mud, buck 'em, and pump blood
Got nothin' to lose, bitch
You better respect rip, or you best just check this slug
It's goin' down, steady pump
And peel rounds, gunnin' witha me gang
Bang, gotta make that money, man
It's still the same, steady runnin' thing wild
And follow me now
While I take you up into a barrel of a gun
See, for the dub you're done
For the bud, I run, for the love of money

[Verse 5: Krayzie Bone]
Gotta get down for my thang off in this thug game
So peep as me creep or me crawlin'
Off on the mission to back in the days
When niggas was bailin'
With sawed-offs, and wanted to get paid
Runnin' to my side, little' nigga
Ripsta, both on the mission for money
You give up the cash, oh, that was your ass
'Cause me and me nigga was hungry
And, bitch, if you're stallin'
You might just catch one to the temple
And um, Bone raw doggin'
So, nigga, just make this shit simple and run
To catch one nigga, me fill 'em with bullets
And dump 'em in rivers, remember, me killer now
For money, me dig you six feet in a ditch
And get richer 'cause, bitch, you were slippin'
I'll cut you and rip you, then buck you down
Steady robbin' and stealin', makin' a killin'
Nigga drugdealin', needin' a million
Hustlin' drugs when the thugs be chillin'
For the money, these niggas be sinnin' off in the cut
Where you find a nigga thuggin' off in braids and skullies
And when I stick you and lick you
Remember I get 'em up for the love of money

[Outro: Krayzie Bone]
Yeah, Bone in the muthafuckin' house
For the nine-quats, nigga
Yeah, rollin' with Ruthless in this bitch
My nigga Layzie Bone, Bizzy Bone
Wish Bone and Flesh-N-Bone
And I'm that nigga Krayzie Bone
In the muthafuckin' house
