[Verse: 1]
You took my love and I'm willing
But there's no limit to the love I'm giving
The love I'm giving, Ooooooooo..

[Verse: 2]
There's no reason why
We should be apart
Ooh, Oh Baby
Cause searching for something out there
Will leave two lonely hearts
Two lonely hearts

[Chorus]
Baby don't you know?
We've come to far to let it all end
I've told you over and over again
How I feel inside but if you go
Oooh baby, there's something you should know

[Hook]
Something you should know
There's something in my heart
Something in my heart, something in my heart
Ooh it's got me hooked on you

[Verse: 3]
Baby if we try
Things will get better
No one can tell me different
We should be together
Baby don't you know?

[Verse:4]
The changes I'm going through
You know I'll never be the same
Your love has touched me so
There's no one else to blame
But you...

[Chrous]
We've come too far to let it all end
I've told you over and over again
How I feel inside but if you go
Ooh baby there's something you should know
Something you should know

[Hook]
There's something you should know
There's something in my heart
Something in my heart, something in my heart
Ooh it's got me hooked on you
