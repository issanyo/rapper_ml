[Intro: Eazy-E]
Yo Dre man, I take this bitch out to the movies and shit
Man we're kissin' and grindin' and shit
So we hop in the back seat
You know man, this bitch rubbin' all over my dick
And frontin' like she's gonna give me the pussy, man
And the bitch said 3 words, man: "Stop", "No", and "Don't"
I said biiiiiitch

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
You don't have to front on me dear
So why don't you just give that pussy here?
If you'd be good to me
Ohh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
All that I want is a little puss'
All that I want is just a little head
If you'd be good to me
Ohh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
You don't have to front on me bitch
Don't be afraid - it's only a dick
Give up the pussy soon
All I want is a little womb
Or get your groupie ass out my hotel room
Or get your groupie ass out my hotel room

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
All I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy
All I want is the pussy
If you'd be good to me
Ohh I'll be good to you
And we'll both ride home in my automobile
We'll both ride home in my automobile
