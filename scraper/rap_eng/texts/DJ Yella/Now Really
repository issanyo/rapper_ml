Everybody talking 'bout funky
But here's where's at

What can we play?
What, what can we play?
What can we play?

[Verse 1:]
We gonna drag you in the alley
Put some garbage on top you
And make you real funky
Kicking back wasting some time
Thinking 'bout some suckas and what comes to mind

Some females that despite me
In other words
The little bitches dislike me
But ask me if I care and I'll just laugh
Straight up while I'm signing my autographs

On the back of your glossy
I'll leave my signature
Cause just face it
Nobody wants a picture of you
Hanging anywhere that they may go
Cause I seen a better picture on a can of Alpo

On the serious tip
The girl is hurt with them big porkchop lips
That keep flopping
Saying nothing worth listening to
So if I ever say wack
Yo, I'm referring to you, homegirl

Yeah, you the ugly one
I'm tired of being nice
So I think it's time I come correct
And let you know where my mind's at
So face the facts

Your record's just wick wick wack too bad
With a capital W
Sugar and spice we didn't forget about you
Don't diss us
Cause you'll be pissing us
And right now I know you're sitting there listening to us

Thinking to yourself how can I get back
Now really, do you think that you can do that?
From what I heard it'll be a hell of a task
If you needed the money, homegirl
All you had to do was ask

And I'd a served you then
Like I'm serving you now
You stupid cows
Get off the tip

Now to the fellas
I'm known as a heartthrob
But everybody thinks of you as a rush job
Rushing everything you do and constantly failing
And then you wonder why you records not selling

Well, first of all it's the concept
For goodness sake
Dissing us now that was your first mistake
Cause when I heard the record I just dropped
I guess you can can
Can what?
Make a flop

Yo, it wasn't funky
It wasn't legit
Cause you're just like a soap opera
Young and the restless

Suckas
It was dumb
It was silly
Thinking you can get some of this
Now really

Yo this is personal on a serious tip
Sassy, tell what time it is

[Verse 2:]
There's only one thing to do
When I'm on the attack
Sit in the corner
Get fitted for the dumb hat
Cause it's me
I'm part of the three
The capital J.J. Fad

So everybody listen up
I got something to say about
All these suckas try a stand in my way

When we dropped Supersonic
Yo, it was a trip
Cause every girl in the world was cold riding the tip
Saying I can beat them their record
So damn sad

Saying let's make a record
Dissing JJ Fad
But we didn't care
Cause supersonic still busting
And at the same time filling our pockets up

That's right
We getting paid cold
Paying the rent
Why you on the sad label
Clocking five percent
Stupid
You so stupid
And I think it's funny
Don't you know the fool spending all your money

Homegirl, you surprised me
I thought that you were smarter that
But you need to put your rhymes back on the spice rack
Cause you a biter biting everything
You know something
I think you even cold bit your name

Sugar and spice
Now that was wack
You coulda been a lil more original than that

And you try to diss us
It was dumb It was silly
Thinking you could get some of this?
Now really (really, really)

Too bad
Sugar and spice
And anybody else who think they can get some
This one's for you
