[Verse 1]
Gotta get down for my change up in this rap game
My mission for jewelry and cars
These bitches are tripping because of my fame
Willing to do anything to get my last name
I’m laughing at ‘em, me and Flashy in the Caddy
Body black, interior gray
Like Snow was driving back in the day
Riding on them factory blades
My eyes is high and under my shades
Shawty saw me and fell in a daze
Then gave me the Miss America wave, hey

[Hook]
How does a nigga like me smoke and maintain, maintain
They saying

[Verse 2]
Vacation they taking the cool out
It’s Maui Wowi in Hawaii posted in the pool house
What y’all niggas gon’ do about me? Nothing
Young Money, we balling in public
Told you bitches is going and coming
Sisters, cousins by the dozen
Loving none of ‘em
My heart only divides into two sides
One devoted to family and one to the loot, right

[Hook]
