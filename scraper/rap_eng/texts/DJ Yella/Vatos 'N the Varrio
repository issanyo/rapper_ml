[Verse 1: Toker]
Rolling down the calle in my rag four
Checking out some hynas got a fifty dollar pore
Went to the park to hit the juice
Crazy homies out there waiting to get loose
A ranfla pulls up, who can that be?
It was crazy ass Danger throwing up the 1-3
He rolled down his window and he started to say
"It's all about crazy South Central L.A."

[Chorus]
Cause the vatos in the varrio are always hard
You come talking that shit we'll go and pull your card
Knowin nothing in life but the crazy Eastside
Don't fuck with us cause we let nada slide

South Central's in the house

[Verse 2: Toker]
Loco triggers down the block to give me the Glock
He said Crazy Speedy was on the rock
The vato Speedy was a friend of mine
Till I caught him in my Chevy tryin to steal the Alpine
Chase him up the calle to call a truce
The silly pendejo pulled out a duece-duece
Little did he know I had a sawed off twelve gage
One puto dead, LA Times front page

[Chorus]
Cause the vatos in the varrio are always hard
You come talking that shit, puto we'll pull your card
And nothing in life but the crazy Eastside
Don't fuck with us cause we let nada slide

[Verse 3: Toker]
Bored as fuck and I wanna get high
So I drove up to the hood in the crazy Eastside
The homies out there making that dollar
I pulled up in my rag-top Impala
They gave me a Corona and I started drinking
And from the buesto my breath started stinking
Left to get my hyna to rock that body
Before I left I hit the Bacardi
Ride to her chaca, so I walked in the pack
My hyna tripped out and she got me mad
She said something that I couldn't believe
Saying shit like all I wanna do is hit
Started talking shit, wouldn't you know
Jumped back like Chavez, punched the ho
Her father jumped up and he started to shout
So I gave his ass a beer and walked his old ass out

[Chorus]
Cause the vatos in the varrio are always hard
You come talking that shit, puto we'll pull your card
And nothing in life but the crazy Eastside
Don't fuck with us cause we let nada slide

[Verse 4: Toker]
I'm rolling hard, and down the street I go
I ran a stop light and hit a fucking pole
I looked at my ranfla and I said "chingado"
I'm not Eazy-E and I can't buy another
Walking home I see the G-ride
Now Lazy's driving feet low on the side
As they busted a U they got pulled over
An undercover crash in a dark green Nova
Filo got beat for resisting arrest
He slapped the pig in the head for dissin dos-uno-tres
Now the homey's locked up for putting up a fight
Third strike on their ass, now they're looking at life

[Chorus]
Cause the vatos in the varrio are always hard
You come talking that shit, puto we'll pull your card
And nothing in life but the crazy Eastside
Don't fuck with us cause we let nada slide

[Verse 5: Toker]
I went to get them out but there was no bail
The homies stuck some putos in the county jail
Two weeks later in Municipal Court
Crazy Filo on trial, mad-doggin' hardcore
Fucking up the court said the judge
On a double life sentence, my homies didn't budge
Baliff walked over to lock them up
The homies looked and grinned and didn't give a fuck
They yelled out their hood and tried to run
Lazy hit the pig and Feelo went for the gun
With shackles on their feet and chains around their waist
The homies fucked up now they got a new case

[Chorus]
Cause the vatos in the varrio are always hard
You come talking that shit, puto we'll pull your card
And nothing in life but the crazy Eastside
Don't fuck with us cause we let nada slide
