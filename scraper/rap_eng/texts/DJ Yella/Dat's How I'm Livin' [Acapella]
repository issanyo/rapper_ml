[Verse 1: B.G. Knocc Out]
Rolling in my hood, twisted on these D's
Age 19 and you can't get with these
B.G.'s, baby gangstas
Putting it down right because we don't allow pranksters
Girls come through, looking fly and real fine
And I know in their mind, all they see is dollar signs
So there for yo, I might met to a trick
Wait 'til nightfall and see if I can hizza
Blaze up some indo, sip a milazay
Cause when I'm with a female, I'm chilling stylize way
And when I get busy homeboy, you know I'm hardly sober
I'll let her work me first, K.O. is taking over
Do a little smacking, flipping and then I'm through
Tell her yeah give me a call sometimes, tomorrow around 2
It's now 2 o'clock and she hit me on the hip
But I can't call her back cause I'm trying to stack my grip
Home-girl might trip the next time that she see me
Messing around to get herself dissed by the B.G
I'm not a women disser but still I ain't giving
Up a damn thing, cause girl, that's how I'm livin'

[Hook: Marlon White]
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin in 9-6
(Yeah, for 9-6 yah)
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
Ooooohhh yeaahh

[Verse 2: B.G. Knocc Out]
Before the brother was rapping
The brother was straight robbing
Gaffling up my name like a part time jobbing
I did it cause that's all I knew
I dropped out the school in the 8th grade
Cause I was going through a straight faze
Living foul as a child back in the days
Until I find out, that the crime does not pay
At age 13 I went to juvenile hog
And on the inside they treat the brother like a dog
So being locked down really ain't the lick
They get to tell the brother when sleep, eat, and shhh
Man forget that, I'd rather be free out in the streets
Getting paid everyday and straight chilling with my peas
Be able to sleep and eat, when and where I wanna
Hanging with my partners tossing 40's on the corner
Now I'm on wax, kicking straight gangsterism
Letting tricks know in '96
Cause yo, that's how I'm livin'

[Hook: Marlon White]
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
(Yeah, for 9-6 yah)
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
Ooooohhh yeaahh

[Verse 3: B.G. Knocc Out]
Now I see there's more to life than just banging
Goin' state to state on the plane entertaining
The world, rockin' shows, knockin' those, everywhere I go
Everybody know K.O
And it feels good to make it out the hood
And be some body like I had always said I would
But though I'm still starving, no more drive-bying
The streets get worse but still the brother keeps trying
To be the best I can, with no time to waste
And since I went straight, I keep the smile on my mama's face
Now I'm a father, I strap a little harder
June 19th of 93 out comes my daughter
Sometimes I get a blur and think about doing dirt
But I checked myself and put my focus in her
That's how I'm livin'

[Hook: Marlon White]
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
(Yeah, for 9-6 yah)
K.O. letting you know
That you can't live with this
That's how livin' in 9-6
Ooooohhh yeaahh
I'm letting you know
