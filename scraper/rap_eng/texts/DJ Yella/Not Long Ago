[Hook]
Not long ago
Remembering the days of you and I...

[Dialogue 1: DJ Yella]
I can sit back and think about the old days
Mean, me and you on the first hooked up, you know?
That was hard, doing all those free shows
Making no money back then but we stuck together
We did all we had to do
But that was cool, you know what I'm saying?
I can remember that

[Hook]
Not long ago
Remembering the days when you and I...
...used to kick it?
Not long ago
Thinking 'bout the past
Thought it'll last
And now you're gone...

[Dialogue 2: DJ Yella]
Remember the last time was on the plane together?
Was going down to Vegas for a convention?
And all we did is talk about business all the way up and back?
Remember that?
I just wish; we could have talked about more thing besides business
Those times were so precious but I didn't even know it then
And it makes me wonder, what's really important?
I can remember that

Remembering the days when you and I...
...used to kick it?
Not long ago
Thinking 'bout the past
Thought it'll last
And now you're gone...

[Dialogue 3: DJ Yella]
You know, there's a lot of things I could've said back then
Like that old saying, "You don't know what you got 'till is gone."
It's true, I do miss you
But I'm glad I stuck around from the beginning to your final resting place
No matter what happened, I never turned my back
I was there, always
I can remember that

Remembering the days when you and I...

Thinking 'bout the past

And now you're gone...

I'll never forget you
(Now you're gone...)
Rest in peace
