Straight outta Compton, a crazy mothafucka named Chuck Taylor
Ridin with a 12 gauge, nigga fuck haters
I got a debt to pay, this for Eazy
And I'll blast any punk mothafucka' don't believe me
I spit 16's
Fuck rap, I got a Mac that'll turn your white T into a Ms. King
I got a attitude, so fuck it
And I'm in the field with them birds like TJ Duckett
LA to NY, the public love him
He the next Ice Cube, so what he thuggin'
And he signed to Aftermath, so what he Bloodin'
You heard that Whoo Kid, I'm in New York buzzin'
Get a XXL and read about me
Page 86, the West can't breathe without me
Kevin Liles, how the fuck could you even doubt me?
I smile, now I got the A-Team around me
In Compton, that's where Dr. Dre found me
Gangbangin', chain hangin', cane slangin' but we turn it to rock
Dope spot so hot the shit burn in the pot
The O.G.'s kept the fiends in line straight
When I was a juvenile, gettin' cash money in '98
That's gangsta, and I'm 21 now
I ain't pick up the mic and put the guns down
It's survival of the fittest
So let's see if he can survive with ten bullets flying through his fitted
These niggas is bitches
And I gotta let the world know that I'm a mothafuckin' straight up menace
I got a semi so don't fuck with me
Or the Compton PD gon' have to come get me
Off your ass and I don't really give a fuck
I let the Eagle blow, nigga what
I got work, so listen to the words, man
We fuck with the rock but don't call us the Byrd Gang
Nigga we criminals
You got beef? Say my name on wax, nigga fuck the subliminals
And it don't matter if you Blood or you Crip
That bulletproof vest don't stop them blue tips
You see me in the streets, you got a Glock then use it
We mob deep, but this ain't Murda Muzik
Keep poppin' that shit, then the tools'll spray
Cause I'm a natural born killer like Cube and Dre
And I'm down with the capital CPT
And you niggas can't fuck with me
Straight outta Compton!
