[Intro: MC Ren]
The year is 1991, N.W.A back on the streets yo
Taking out all you commercialized suckers
And we're on this laid back track
And we're doin' this one kinda smooth
So whatcha gonna do, Dre? - Kick it!

[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
And so on, let the beat flow on
Because I need something to go off on
The one and only D-R-E servin' a death wish
So I'mma hit you like this
Early in the morning, hop into the B-en-z
I got 44 ways of getting paid
Sitting in my lap as I roll off the Compton blocks
To scoop up Ren, I heard shots
1-2-3, then I seen Ren
Hopping the fence and with the .45 inside his hand
He ran to the Benz, got in and said
"Dre, I was speaking to your girl O'Shea"
And as we roll on, I seen the patroller creep
So we got ghost before they peeped
Me and Ren in a black CE, yo
Bumping some funky tracks by the D.O.C
I gotta get paid, paid in a hurry, see
I got a habit if I'm not paid thoroughly
I start takin', makin' sure the money is steady coming
Because I'm always into something

[Interlude: Admiral Dancehall]

[Verse 2: MC Ren]
I heard a dope beat, somebody told me to go through it
But if Dre didn't do it I can't flow to it
N.W.A is like a mix of hard time and hard rhymes
In the same lines
You're taking a chance when you think that
Talking under your breath won't lead to young death
Taking a life, ainâ€™t nothing but a killing
For a brother labeled as being a young black villain
But you don't know me, a record can't tell ya
How so many prayed that I be just another failure
Real G's ain't about faking but taking
I hooked up with N.W.A and started making
Funky hyped lyrics for your system
Might sound nice so it makes you wanna listen to a
Sample of a ruthless organization
But you don't want a confrontation
Real G's don't play
Yella, Eazy, me and my homeboy Dre
Yo, always making sure that my beats is steady bumping
Because I'm always into something

[Interlude: Admiral Dancehall]

[Verse 3: Dr. Dre]
Yo, because I'm in it for life
And in the beginning I was stacking
Now everyone wanna jack-in
Watching a softy, punk strong as coffee
A brother like that best to back up off me
Yo, cause these are the days and the times of the real G
You cross me, you getting tossed see
And that's on the real, cause I'm know to get ill
Again and again, so tell them what's up Ren

[Verse 4: MC Ren]
If I'm not into nothing, I don't feel right
So I get my boys and we roll yo, and start some wrecking at night
Because I can never conceive myself from sittin' in a cell
Where the crime was too tragic I couldn't make bail
So now they gotta hold me
And listen to rehabilitation over and over, sayin' they told me
But I don't really care, cause I know my music is bumping
Now Ren is always into something
