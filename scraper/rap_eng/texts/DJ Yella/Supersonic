[Intro: MC J.B., Sassy C., & All]
We're J.J. Fad and we're here to rock
Rhymes like ours could never be stopped
See, there's three of us and I know we're fresh
Party rockers, non-stoppers, and our es are def
See, the "J" is for "just"
The other for "jammin'"
The "F" is for "fresh"
"A" and "D," "def"
Behind the turntables is DJ Train
Mixin' and scratchin' is the name of the game
Now here's a little somethin' 'bout nosy people
It's not real hard, it's plain and simple
Baby-D

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic
Supersonic

[Verse 1: Baby-D]
Supersonic motivating rhymes are creating
And everybody knows that J.J. Fad is devastating
We know you like us girls so you better get stirl'
Cause we are the home chicks that are rockin' your world

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic
Supersonic

[Verse 2: Sassy C. & (Baby-D)]
Supersonic is a word when people start to listen
Especially bigger people, they pay close attention
You might not believe it, you might not even buy it
But when it comes to our lady (beatbox)
You might even try it

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic
Supersonic

[Verse 3: MC J.B.]
Now all you supersonic people try to bite our rhymes
You may think that you are def, but you're way behind
S-s-so, you better listen good to what we have to say
'Cause when it comes to J.J. Fad, you can't get no play

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic
Supersonic

[Verse 4: Sassy C.]
Now he's the freshest DJ from coast to coast
My man can cut and scratch, but I don't mean to boast
He may be a little light, but that's okay
'Cause when he cuts to the beat, it sounds this way
Hit it

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic
Supersonic

[Verse 5: Baby-D]
Uh, uh, uh, yeah, it's finally my turn to rock the mic
Because my devastating beats I know you will like
You see my beat box is fresh, it'll blow your mind
And if you don't like my beats, I'll go big in your behind
(Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-uh-uh-ha)

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic
Supersonic

[Verse 6: Baby-D & MC J.B.]
Now you party people know what Supersonic means
We didn't try to brag cause J.J. Fad is just too clean
Now baby, don't you know that our rhymes are so bionic
Don't listen too hard, don't be supersonic

[Chorus: All]
Supersonic
Supersonic

[Verse 7: Sassy C., Baby-D, MC J.B. & All]
You see, the "S" is for super
And the "U" is for unique
The "P" is for perfection
And you know that we are freaks
The "E" is for exotic
And the "R" is for raps
So tell those nosy people just to stay the hell back

[Bridge: All, Baby-D & Sassy C.]
Supersonic
Them big everlasting ears
Supersonic
They can hear what I say faster than I can say it
Supersonic
They better chill
(Rockbox) It's like, it's like
She's supersonic
You ran out of words
Hit it, Baby-D

[Verse 8: Baby-D, MC J.B., Sassy C & All]
I'm light-skinned, devastatin'
I know one thing that he is hatin'
That's right, 'cause doll, I think
I'll take your man and you made him
Always rappin', always clappin', everybody say I'm happy
If you try to hang with me, you should finally, truly see
I'm always rockin', never stoppin', devastatin' rappin' lady
When I'm on the microphone to see here all these imitators
Figure is the difference is that everybody say I'm different
There's no other angel lover
Everybody know I'm covered
Clientele is a pearl, everybody know in jail
To the beat so you can tell everybody know your cell
A sama lama lama lama doo ma nama  seema nama
Lama nama doo ma nama lama nama seema nama
Lama nama doo a nama nama nama seema lama
Lama nama seema nama doo ma nama hama, yeah
Yeah, that was it
That's it
