[Intro]
Hello this is Dr.Dre. I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name
And number at the sound of the beep
I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return
(Hello, Dre, this is Patricia. My husband's out of town and I was wondering...Do you make house calls ?)

[Verse 1]
Ridin' in my car alone not doin' anything
Stopped the answering service because
I knew my phone would ring
Heard it ring once so I picked it up and said "Hello"
It's Dr. Dre, baby, not your average gigolo

[Chorus]
'Cause I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac
House calls, the human aphrodisiac
I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone
House calls, when your husband's not at home

[Verse 2]
It's a quarter after two, I said I'd show around three
Her husband's out of town and she would like some surgery
Stopped at the stores so I could get a little wine
But all they had was Thunderbird 1979
So I left the store, got in my car, drove to her house and then
Knocked on the door and heard this sexy voice that said 'come in'
Opened the door to see what I got from this house call
Tall, dark and lovely, 5 foot 8 in a camisole

[Chorus]
'Cause I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac
House calls, the human aphrodisiac
I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone
House calls, when your husband's not at home
'Cause I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac
House calls, the human aphrodisiac
I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone
House calls, when your husband's not at home

[Verse 3]
Now my name is Dre, 6 ft tall with weavy hair
The one that comes around when your man just doesn't care
So if ya feelin' sexy late at night and you're all alone
Just think about the doctor, pick up the telephone

[Chorus]
'Cause I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac
House calls, the human aphrodisiac
I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone
House calls, when your husband's not at home
'Cause I make house calls, it's Dr. Dre the maniac
House calls, the human aphrodisiac
I love those house calls to the girls that's all alone
House calls, when your husband's not at home

[Outro]
Hello this is Dr. Dre. I'm not in right now
But if you leave your name
And number at the sound of the beep
I'll be sure to give you a call as soon as I return
(Dre, this is Rene. Do you take American Express ?)
(Dre, this is Alicia. You know what the mood is...)
(Yo Doc, Lonzo, Two jaccuzis free. Bring yo trunks)
(Yo doc, it's me again. About those trunks, Forget 'em)
(Yo Dre man, whassup, huh ? Cathy's back in town)
(Dre, I think Luther knows about us)
(Say fool, you left ya driving licence over here last night
Now I'm a have to whoop yo ass)
