I don't know what was said, my baby
I thought that everything was fine
You said you got to get away to find yourself
Now baby can't you tell, it's written all over my face
My days and nights would be living hell [If you go away]
So think about the misery [That you're going to put me through]

Goodbye
Doesn't me a thing with you and I
No baby...
Our love had stood through all of test of time
Yes it has...
And if you're planning to leave me behind
Oh...
Let me put one more thing on; you're mine

If you ever need me baby
[Send for me]
I'm just a telephone call away
[Send for me]
Listen, put a message in a bottle, baby, baby
[Send for me]

Mhm and I'll be alright
You see, you're my everything
My whole world revolves around you
And nothing is what I am without you here in my life
