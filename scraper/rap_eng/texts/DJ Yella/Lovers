[Cli-n-tel]
The whole crew was chillin at this club
And we had just got into town
There were so many fine young ladies
We just had to throw down

I spotted a girl sitting all alone
And she was looking exceptionally well
So I walked over and said
"Hello my name is Cli-n-tel"

And here is one point I'd like to make
And I'm sure you'll understand
If you spend some time with me tonight
I'll take you to Wonderland (oh girl)

We could pass through time
Or take a terrestrial flight
You and I one on one
Making love all through the night
But she said...

[Michel'le]
I don't want to be lovers
Before we are friends
I don't want this love to start
Before it begins

You say that you want me
You say that you care
But deep in my heart it's saying
I better beware

[Dr. Dre]
Hey what's happening, baby
Dr. Dre is who I am
And would you please tell me
That your name in not Roxanne

They call me to surgery
Seven days a week
And if you come with me tonight
I'll prove I'm a freak

You look like the type of girl
Who expects a lot
But I'll give you just what you want
At The Snooty Fox

You can come or you can stay
It'll be your decision
But I'm Dr. Dre
And you'll love the way I make my incision
But she said...

I don't want to be lovers

You say that you want me
You say that you care
But deep in my heart it's saying
I better beware

[DJ Yella]
Excuse me miss
I notice you're sitting all alone
And you're looking so good
I'd just love to take you home

My name is DJ Yella
And you're the girl that I choose
So if you take a chance on me
There's no way you can lose

Yes I'm a Sagittarius
And I love to have fun
So if you're searching for a man baby
Look no further because I'm the one

My hotel room is right up the street
And you're such a lovely sight
I'm only going to be in town for one day
So let's make love tonight
But she said...

[Lonzo]
I was the last one to approach her
It was almost time to go
I walked over sat down and said
"Hi, my name is Lonzo"

I'm the leader of the crew
The pilot of the ship
And if you come with me
I'll take you on an unforgettable trip

Come fly with me
And you'll feel what you never felt
You can relax in the cockpit
As I unfasten my safety belt

And before we land
Oh girl you'll discover
That Grandmaster Lonz is a
An international lover
But she said...

Don't want to be lovers

You say that you want me baby
You say that you care
But deep in my heart it's saying
I better beware

Well I thank you guys for the compliments
And all of you are real cute
But unfortunately
None of my needs you'll suit

I'm not looking for a relationship
Not even a one night stand
Though I'm sure all of you
Are masters of romance
