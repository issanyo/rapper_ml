[Intro - samples]
Kick that x5
Cold kicking ow
Kick that
Funky fresh Eazy-E
Kick that
Cold kicking ow
Pull up a chair and I'ma tear it up

[Verse 1: Eazy-E]
I don't drink brass monkey, like the beat funky
Nickname Eazy-E, yo 8 ball junkie
Bass drum kicking and a snag I nag
And if ain't rap, then you know it's crap
Crowd rocking sucker stomper from around the way
I got a six-shooter, yo, mean hombre
E rolling out, to find the Boyz
To kick dust and cuss, crank up some noise
Police on my tail, I don’t like jail
40 ounce in my lap and it's cold as hell
Hook a right turn and let the dim go up
Then I say to myself, they can kiss my butt
Hip to get drunk got the eight in my lips
Put in the old tape Marvin Gaye's greatest hits
Rolling so hard had the bass cold whomping
Cruising through the Eastside, South of Compton
See a big butt, and I say word
I took a look at her face, and the girl was to the curb
But she was on my tip for the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's getting busy got the 8 ball rolling

[Hook: Samples]
I, was...cold kicking ass
I, was...raised in L.A
I, was...cruising down the street in my six-four
Too much posse

[Verse 2: Eazy-E]
Riding on Slausson, looking for Crenshaw
Turned down the sound, to ditch the law
Stopped at a light and wouldn't you now
A Cadillac almost wrecked the six-fo'
Flipped him off, cruise by the mall
Went to the store for some Olde 8 ball
Acting real ill cause I was drunk
See a sucker punk, had to go in my trunk
Reached inside cause it's like that
Came back out with a silver gat
Pointed at the fool, and it was all because
I had to show the boy what time it was
When I turned around it was like a mirage
Knucklehead like that got out of dodge
Suckers be illing cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's in affect and got the 8 ball rolling

[Verse 3: Eazy-E]
Olde English 800, cause that's my brand
Take it in a bottle, forty, quart or can
Drink it like a madman, yes I do
Forget the police and a 5-0-2
Stepped in the party, I was drunk as hell
Three girls already said," Eric yo' breath smells! "
8 ball in hand, that's what I got
"Yo man, you see Eazy hurlin' in the parkin' lot?"
Punked your lady, stepped on her toe
Asked her to dance and she said, hell no
Called her a skizzy because that's the rule
Boyz-n-the hood trying to keep me cool
You tell my homeboys you wanna kick my butt
I walked in your face and we get 'em up
I started dropping the dogs, and watch you fold
Just dumb stupid bum, got knocked out cold
"Made you look sick, you snotty nosed prick
Now your fly ***** is all over his ****"
Fool got dropped cause the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's hardcore and got the 8 ball rolling

[Verse 4: Eazy-E]
Yo pass the brew Ren while I tear shit up
And y'all listen up close to roll call
Eazy-E's in the place I got money and juice
Rendezvous with me and we make the deuce
Dre makes the beats so funk funk funky
Do the Olde 8, forget the brass monkey
Ice Cube writes the rhymes, that I say
Hail to the homies from C.I.A
Krazy D is down and in effect
We make hardcore jams, so give us respect
Make a toast stupid punk to the title I'm holding
Eazy-E's breaking out and got the 8 ball rolling

[Outro: Eazy, (MC Ren), ]
Man I'm outta here
(Yo Eazy, you forgot to tell 'em what city you chill in)
