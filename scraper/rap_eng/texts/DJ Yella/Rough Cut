It's now time to lay a rap about the cold hard streets
People strugglin hard just tryina make ends meet
I just stand tough, hold down my beat
Never understand the meaning of the word 'defeat'
So you say it's like that and that's the way it is
But when I'm on the microphone it goes somethin like this
Body-breakin, booty-shakin, the money for the makin
You just put it in my pocket cause you know I gotta take it

It's rough, it's tough
Let me see if you can hack my stuff

It's rough, rough, rough, rough

It's rough, it's tough
We gonna rock you till you get enough

It's rough
It's rough

Russians got a thing about shooting down planes
They did it before, now they're doin it again
Can't you see that this world is comin to an end?
I wish that everyone would just go make friends
You're tellin me shit about the friendly skies
But to me it's all just a big pack of lies
Sit at your TV set, get all hypnotized
But it's about time that you realized

It's rough, it's tough
We gonna rock you till you get enough

It's rough, it's tough

Let's rough, so tough
Let me see if you can hack my stuff

Rough, rough, rough, r...

So you tried to stay on the good side of the law
But then [?]
You make one mistake and you're behind the brick wall
Told you sooner or later you'd take the fall
Thought you was bad 'cause you joined the gang
But let me tell you, billy boy, you've just been had
'Cause your homeboy, he didn't wanna do no time
While you do your thing, he dropped the dime
Is this something you can call a real true friend
Turn around to backstab you in the end
Now he's on the outside looking in
There's a frown on your face, a grin on him
You see, things like these happen every day
I know there is a a better way
Instead of being in the [?] with nowhere to go
Searching for your pot of gold in the end of the rainbow

It's rough, it's tough
I'm gonna see if you can hack my stuff

It's rough, it's tough

It's rough, so tough
We gonna rock you till you get enough

It's rough, rough, tough, tough...

So now you heard of the negative part
And we wanna see you make a brand new start
Let me tell exactly like my mama told me
Be a doctor, be a lawyer, get a PhD
Making your mark on this world [?]
So wise up, kids, and stay in school
So when after you learn your ABC's
You can come and rock the party with me

Well, i'm Kid Frost, and that's my name
And when i go to a party like i run my game
With the utmost ease, i tell you right now
If you got that funky feeling and you're wondering how
My rhymes are hard, and never soft
I just get on the mic and never wanna stop
I'm so full of action, the ladies' attraction
I won more awards than Michael Jackson
Breakdancers, romancers
Ain't got no time for no second chancers
And when the sucker MC's try to be like me
Let me tell you now boy, how it's gonna be
If you need some help you better call your mom
You better stick to your hat like bubble gum
'Cause the K-I-D F-R-O-S-T
Kid Frost, better known as [?]

Yeah, Kid Frost, the rappin boss
Guaranteed to make your body wanna twist and toss
Loosen up your back and then you [?]
If you ain't [?], well your woman just might
But before i get you lost in my originality
You gonna have to wait for my next LP

It's rough, it's tough
It's rough, it's tough
I thought you'd know, it's rough
