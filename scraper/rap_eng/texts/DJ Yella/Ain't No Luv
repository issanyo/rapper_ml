[Intro: Opening Skit]
(*Inhale*)
[DJ Yella]  Shit, so where the fuck we're goin? (*EXhale*)
[Dirty Red] Let's go fuck with the bitches there
[DJ Yella]  Aww house bitches, ha ha ha, hell yeah, shit
Fuck off man, put the shit out
These mothafuckers behind us and shit
(*Inhale*)   (*EXhale*)
[Dirty Red] Fuck the mothafuckers man, I ain't put my shit out
[DJ Yella]  Speed on, and let's do this shit

[*The Beats Started*]
[Dirty Red] yeah, that's right
[DJ Yella]  Dirty Red is in the house
[Dirty Red] Once again, nigga
[DJ Yella]  The Y-E-Double-L-A in this mothafucker (*Laughter*)
[Dirty Red] Awww shit
[DJ Yella]  You can do somethin' like this?
[Dirty Red] What you wanna do it like?
[DJ Yella]  Now, I'm about it like, kick back, come on
[Dirty Red] Yeah

[Verse 1: Dirty Red]
Born black, now I'm livin' in a fucked place
Tryin' to survive, as I stake my case
I took due without a clue in the early mornin'
Cops beatin' niggas down, so I knew it was on
They got my drawers and the stash from my shoe box
As I rushed to the bathroom to flush my rocks
I heard BOOM and a voice sayin "GET ON THE FLOOR NOW!"
Now, I'm hopin' the God these mothafuckers don't kill me
Illegal search, with no evidents
But took me to jail, although the nigga was innocent
Life is a bitch when you're in the streets
But I see the same shit happened every week
Nigga, ain't no love

[Chorus]
I said ain't no love, I ain't gettin' love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love, love, I ain't gettin' love
Nigga, ain't no love
Ain't no love, haaayyyy
Ain't no love
I said ain't no love, love, love, haayyy

[Verse 2: Dirty Red]
Now, I'm pissed off cause I'm couped in a jail cell
Sick into my stamock from another nigga shit smell
But oh well, what else can I do?
But sittin' mad in the mothafucker, drapped in county blue
Now, they're talkin' about Chow time
Brought me a tripe full of green ass slime
I'm doin' time for a crime I didn't commit
They say I'm doin' 5 Streach but that's bullshit (*Gun Shot*)
I need to use the phone G
Gettin' touch with my girl so she can bring 5 Gs
Cause I'm finna make bail
Before I be broke nigga, fuckin' with the jail
Cause there ain't no love for a nigga from the ghetto
Especially with cops, they like to break the young fellow
Fool, life is a bitch when you're in the streets
But I see the same shit happened every week
Ain't no love

[Chorus]
I said ain't no love, I ain't gettin' love
Nigga, ain't no love
I said ain't no love, love, love, I ain't gettin' love
Ain't no love
Ain't no love, hoo haaayyyy
Nigga, ain't no love
I said ain't no love, no love, no love

[Break: DJ Yella]
This is dedicated to my nigga E
The mothafuckin' Hip-Hop Thuggster
Straight from the C-P-T
R.I.P. nigga

[Verse 3: Dirty Red]
Now an hour went by, since I made bail
I'm back in the streets and about to raise hell
A nigga showed on the ki and I have five Gs
Finna put on some work with all the dope fiends
Back on my feet and hardly know time
I got the gat from the crib
And now I'm searchin' for the nigga who dropped the dime
So I can do him in close range
I know the shit sounds strange but nobody can change things
When you're thinkin' about the time you spent
Locked up for what? - to take the pay cut
Fuck that! pay back as a mothafucker
Although, I hate takin' out young niggas (*Gun Shot*)
I gotta do what I gotta do
And if you was in my shoes I think you probably do it too
Found the nigga, put my finger on the trigger finna spray
Cause there ain't no love everyday all day

[Outro: Dirty Red]
Nigga, ain't no love
Ain't no love
Nigga, ain't no love
Ain't no love
Nigga, ain't no love
Ain't no love
Nigga, ain't no love
Ain't no love
