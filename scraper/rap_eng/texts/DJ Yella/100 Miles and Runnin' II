[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout to rip this instrumental, I’m temperamental with the flow
My bars are so detrimental
I’m the only rapper out here that will dismantle your mental
I attack this rapping viciously, I never come in gentle
I’m still spitting it clean, my albums don’t need Parental
Advisory stickers on them, if they do, it’s accidental
I’m monumental, you can see where I’ve been like a lentil
I’m not stopping till intercontinental cities are on my schedule
Potential, I’m all around it like it was an axis
Putting my city on the map, taking over the atlas
If you try to come near me, I’m stabbing like a cactus
I’m dangerous so why you sleeping on me like a mattress?
I'll attack it, and steal the show like a bandit
Like a rabbit, I got Trix and my lyricism is magic
I’m just ripping this diction, no description for my linguistics
I just spit it and kill it and there’s nothing that you can do about it

[Verse 2]
It's understandable how you could doubt the flow cuz I'm impractical
I’m only a quarter-way to the top as far as ladders go
No such such thing as rational when you’re getting that capital
It's eating at my insides like cannibals, I'm an animal
My words are flammable, Michael B. Jordan, I'm a human torch
My fire be burning boom boxes blasting from your porch
My flow is diamond and everyone else be spitting quartz
Not really, I'm just talking mess with no remorse because I'm gifted
Your perception of rap will be shifted if you just listen
If your checking logistics, I’m just another statistic
Some black kid fulling a vision that’s unrealistic
No need to be pessimistic, I get it
I realize no matter how I try the odds aren’t in my favor
Probably have better chances being a basketball player
Or a skater, or something governmental like the mayor
Either way I’m not stopping till I finally get to hit the paydirt
It’s in my nature, that everywhere I go I do it major
And leave an impact like asteroids, I'm making craters
I’m blazing my own path like I'm a navigator
All these haters can go bite me like an alligator
I’m a creator of something that you ain’t heard about
I’m gonna get to my destination without a doubt
This is that music that your playlist couldn’t live without
My flow’s so hot that I can send total cities into a drought
Evaporation, that what I'm talking (Uh)
Get the beats ready, I'll get it popping (Yeah)
And I'm still going, there ain't no stopping (Ha)
Who's at the door? Opportunity is knocking
And its telling me that I got the potential to be something good
I took that and made myself into what I knew I would
I'm not fronting, I’m so cunning, I'm so stunning, I'm so buzzing
I’m so high up that if I ever fall I'ma hit the ground running
