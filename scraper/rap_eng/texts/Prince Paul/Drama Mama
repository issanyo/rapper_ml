[Hook]
I used to be your fool baby, but I ain't gon be your fool no more
I used to be your fool baby, but I ain't gon be your fool no more
I used to be your fool baby, but I ain't gon be your fool no more

[Verse 1: Truth Enola]
Drama queen, givin' a man
Best of the sex, Worst of the stress
Half of the love, half the respect
Overstand your emotional moods, it's a blank
When it comes to my technical ways, gettin' bank
First message on my cell, "Daddy please come home."
Second message, "Daddy please, I don't wanna be alone."
Third message, "I know you fuckin' them bitches out there."
Forth message, "When you get home, I won't be there."
Lady, givin' me drama, more than my soul can accommodate
Watch your shit miss, I need some time away
A little liquor I'm, a little drunk I'm
Gonna wash away the way you front
When you know I spend a lot right (Right)
Hit the spot right (right)
Split your back right, even lick your cat right
Fuckin' with you, spectacular brain
End of the game, I'll probably be shackled and chained
Drama queen

[Hook]
I used to be your fool baby, but I ain't gon be your fool no more

[Verse 2: Trugoy]
You made me hit you once and kick you out four times
And you're still in my two way lookin' for a lemon
Stay givin' me hell when all I want is peace, pussy and progress
To make our little [shack/Shaq?] Shaquille
I hustle state to state, smugglin' two inches into studios
Just to cut the dope deal
You stand on my moods when you got your heels
Dead center on my back, bitch get off me
You wanna 9 to 5 mono-typical Joe
Well I'm a 12 to 12 stereo, extra ordinary
You stay with your hands in my face which makes it very
Difficult not to reflex (reflex)
Picture me on The Source cover
Ike Turner smile big headline "Peaceful rapper goes wiiiild"
We at it again, it ain't gon' end
My niggas whisperin', "It must be the sex."
She's my drama queen

[Hook]
I used to be your fool baby, but I ain't gon be your fool no more
I used to be your fool baby, but I ain't gon be your fool no more

[Outro:???]
Love, Life
You holdin' me too tight, and if you up and leave
Still gon' be alright

[Skit: Dave Chappelle]
"I love this shit more than... what's something a nigga really love? Yeah, I love this shit more than pussy with barbeque sauce on it nigga this is fucking delicious"
