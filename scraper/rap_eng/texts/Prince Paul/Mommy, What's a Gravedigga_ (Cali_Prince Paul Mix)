Mommy, what's a Gravedigga? [x5] (Gravediggaaazz)
Mommy, what is a Gravedigga?

[VERSE 1: Rza/Rzarector]

Yo, I had a nightmare!
That I slept for a light year
And a thousand roaches had crawled inside my right ear
Then I found myself trapped inside of a circle
Surrounded by 40 wicked women who was all dressed in purple
They promised they would harm the nations with the abominations
Fortification, indoctrination of intoxications
It was at that moment, I realized who was my opponent
It was Gog from Magog he said he wanted to slay god
He brought his rapture from Ezekiel 29th chapter
Said they wanted to fracture my skull, so he could capture my soul
My body got drawn to a life left deformed
As my essence tried to squeeze through the crack of dawn
But I got trapped in a void, watching thousands of paranoid
Humanoids floating in space like asteroids
The pain in my head, was excruciating
It must have been the dust that had me hallucinating
Then I was facing Satan and he was debating with Reagan
Over who killed Kennedy, the true identity of the Holy Ghost Trinity
And lack of masculinity
About to lose it, but I flashed back to blunts dipped in honey
The first jewels that I mastered when I learned 120
About who's the original biochemical father
The cream of civilization, the universal author
It was me, it struck me, and caused me to figure
I realized to myself, that I'm a Gravedigga!

[Hook: All]

Mommie, what's a Gravedigga? [x4]

[VERSE 2: Too Poetic/Grymreaper]

On a cold night in January, foes invaded my sanctuary
With the archbishop of Canterbury
To cause confusion, they drugged my plasma solution
Till I saw visions and illusions
My body hit the bottom of a dark black pit
Full of snakes with poisonous lips swimming in piss
The spell was atrocious, I stood still
Getting vexed, ferocious and ready to kill
My soul was a vast innovation of trife
Like Job or The Last Temptation of Christ
As I acknowledged the blackness, survival tactics
Got active, my soul wore a Full Metal Jacket
Interrogated by djinns, who penetrated my skin
With pins to learn the secrets of the Grym
The fire that burns in my bosom like Jeremiah
Sparks through the dark on those who inquire

[Hook: All]

Mommie, what's a Gravedigga? [x4]

[VERSE 3: Frukwan/Gatekeeper]

As you rotate on your axis, vaporize the skies
Make it dark like solar facts is
Still amongst the solids, liquids, and the gases
Steady building heat as the rain turned to acid
Yo, we came strong stimulated with the drugs I'm the potion
Swelling, my brain cells constantly in motion
I charge like a lightning bolt caught in a note
A spinning black pole swallowed me like a throat
Yo, it felt like a prison, the walls was a living organism
That had mad curves like the wisdom, but it wasn't
Cos knowledge is the key to confusion
Man made pollution, child I was abused with intrusion
Tossed in a hole, 6 years old, "Let me go!"
At 12 I was a shooting arrow
Cause now my degrees are passed to my youngest seed
And when she stepped to my queen, she said:

[Hook: All]

[OUTRO: Prince Paul/Undertaker]

Mommie, what's a Gravedigga? [x5]
Walking in the shadows you realize
Mommie, what is a Gravedigga?
That life is nothing but a form of
Animated death
Yo, I had a Nightmare! [echoes]
Animated death [echoes]
Gatekeep [echoes]
