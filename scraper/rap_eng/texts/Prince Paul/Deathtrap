[Intro: Masta Ace]
The Masta, the Ace-Inc
Lost is the ghetto dweller trapped in a cage
There's no way out of the death trap

[Hook: Frukwan]
You can't come back
No matter what you do when you fall in a death trap
You can't come back
No matter what you do when you fall

[Verse 1: Frukwan]
Time and time again life's getting shorter
Fear in the air what appears is the porter
A nigga named Stef, was shooting up meth
With some coke, had a stroke, so I chilled for his death
Time has arrived, fallen one mine
All the sin stepping in on my face is a grin
Another dumb vic once moved now stiff
Grabbed em by the wrist, come to the abyss
Meet Katie, abortion was known with this lady
A Ph.D. many degrees had Mercedes
Car. She took it to a bar got lit
Like a skunk got drunk, danced with a punk
Boom, she took the car to the nigga's pad
She didn't want to kick it so the bitch got stabbed
Wrong place and wrong time don't exist no more
Or for, according to the Gravedigga law
So watch what you do 'fore a fool talks back
And behold, riding on your shoulders a Death Trap

[Hook]

[Verse 2: RZA]
This crab named Black, brother sell up crack
And it's a natural fact, in his pockets he had stacks
Bad ass Beamer he drove, cause he sold his soul
To get a hold of the chrome and gold
True, he felt good as he walked his hood
Being hunted every night, like a bear in the woods
See cops play the role of a fox
If they catch your ass out on the block hot
It's back to the penalty box
But Black was the type that was like
"Yo fuck the C-cipher, I got to get papes, every night"
Chills but you can't for kills
C-Cipher, ain't the only niggas on the bill
He had like a quarter mil stashed on him
With the click, came through, and he blasted em
So perhaps you're catching mad snap like that
Nigga Black, smack, but you caught by the death trap

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Too Poetic]
Lizzie had a body like a Lexus Coupe
Her step-father, was robbing the cradle banging her boots
Her heartbeat increased at night she couldn't sleep
Daddy dearest, was bringing her grief between sheets
Deep scars invaded her soul force and mind
Six years of torture started at age nine
At age sixteen already an old maid
It seems, she was caught like Freddy in a bad dream
Meanwhile her body is being defiled
Telling her mother, only brought a stage of denial
Moms telling pops to low-down
Led to a showdown, for a week shit slowed down
But one night overcome by lust
Father Dukes tried to score just one more thrust
He should've held back cause Lizzie got an axe
Gave his dick forty whacks and threw his ass in the death....

[Outro: Frukwan]
You can't come back
