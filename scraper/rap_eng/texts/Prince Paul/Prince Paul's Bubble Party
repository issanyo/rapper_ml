[Intro: Spongebob + (Patrick) + Squidward]
Could I interest you in some lessons?
Only 25 cents
(Uh...very well then)
Oh boy
Good morning to you, sir
Would you care to blow a bubble?
(How much is it?)

[Verse 1}
It's a nice day and the water's cool
Spongebob's looking for something to do
To earn money and stay out of trouble
He built his own stand for blowing bubbles
Squidward said no one in the water
Wants to blow bubbles and pay him a quarter
But Patrick would if he hadn't spent it
He's not worried, Spongebob will lend it
Spongebob gave him the bubble wand
So Patrick could have to blow bubbles on
Use his breath then borrow 25 cents again from Spongebob and get some lessons like

[Bridge: Spongebob + Prince Paul]
First go like this
Spin around
Stop!
(It's all in the technique)
Double take three times
Alright
One, two, three
(It's all in the technique)
First go like this
Like this?
Spin around
Stop!
(It's all in the technique)
Double take three times
Alright
And...
Pelvic thrust!
(It's all in the technique)
Woooo!

[Verse 2]
Bubbles can be any size
Big as elephants, small as butter flies
Round as a ball like [?] ducks
Use one or two hands to blow them up
So if you want the bubbles not to pop
I suggest you check out Spongebob and watch

[Bridge: Spongebob + Prince Paul + Squidward]
Now it's time to bring it around town
Bring it around town
'Round and 'round
Then you do this
'Round and 'round
And this
And this *dolphin noise*
Then that and this and that *boat horn* *shore bell*
And this and that and that
'Round and 'round
How can you two possibly make all this noise just blowing bubbles?
Bubbles
Bubbles
Bubbles
Bubbles

[Verse 3]
Squidward wouldn't blow bubbles at first
Because it wouldn't work or quickly burst
Blowing bubbles he thought was easy to do
Lessons from Spongebob, he needed them too
He blew so hard he got red cheeks
Then he tried Spongebob's blowing technique

[Bridge: Spongebob + Prince Paul]
(It's a-, It's a-, It's all, It's a-, it's all in the technique)
First go like this
Spin around
Stop!
(It's all in the technique)
Double take three times
Alright
One, two, three
(It's all in the technique)
First go like this
Like this?
Spin around
Stop!
(It's all in the technique)
Double take three times
Alright
And...
Pelvic thrust!
(It's all in the technique)
Woooo!

[Outro: Spongebob + Squidward]
Ladadee, ladadoo, ladadaa
It's just annoying
Ladadee, ladadoo, ladadaa
Blowing bubbles
Ladadee, ladadoo, ladadaa (Ladadee, ladadoo, ladadum)
(It's all in the technique)
Ladadee, ladadoo, ladadum
(It's all in the technique)

WHO BLEW THIS BUBBLE?
