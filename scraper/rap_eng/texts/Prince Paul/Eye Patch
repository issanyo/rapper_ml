[Intro: Pete Rodriguez]
Thank you, thank you
And for my latest basket of cheers, here it goes, baby!

[Refrain]
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind
Mess up my mind wit the eye patch
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind
Mess up my mind wit the eye patch
Mess up my mind, mess up my mind
Mess up my mind wit the eye patch
(Everything I do gonna be funky)

[Verse 1: Pos + Dove]
Channeling in sync so my would bring (What!)
Wit dat, causin' all fat I'm responsible for ya diet (Keep it quiet!)
Yo I got beats, State this stitch on my national fabric
My daughter will speak the arabic that's how I live
Levitate to my nation when holding up your nickels
I pie like crumble so I Don like Rickles
Like green on the pickle
My papes are the up master of the cabbage patch
Ya eyes got the latch
So catch the cut, I hold the rut
For the people's reminder when in Maseo Path
I be the finder of the patch

[Verse 2: Dove]
Can the cat's tongue slip, ya do the 'da zip'
Take the horse into the jolly ranch
Keep the hush
The good, the bad, and Uncle Tom, beat it kid (Whoa!)
Do doo doo do do do do do
Show the sheep cause I found the food
When I string the man wit the eye patch, the eye patch
When I'm walkin' it and could ya make it go sha na na na
(Mmmmmmm)

[Verse 3: Pos]
It sniffs good
Punks show disguises when I'm standing in the wood
I be the in cause the brother holdin' Glocks is out
I be the in cause the pusher runnin' blocks is out
I be the in cause the kid smokin' weed
Shootin' seed which leads to a girl's stomach
Being 'bout a half a ton is out
Show the finger print and give me good grief for my lumber
Pants will sag cause my license as a plumber
Feel the Plug (yo, something's wrong here)
Now give a shout

[Outro: Dove + Pos + Mase]
Yo what's up, I'd like to give a holler to Big 4-7 off in the Oakenone!
And I bring an income in to my baby girl Twyla in White Plains and all my peoples out in Delaware
Yeah yeah yeah, and I like to give a shout out to all those r appers who dissed us on records, and I wanna let you know you're still wack. And oh yeah, I ain't mentioned no names cause you might f-

(All right. I'm sorry, I didn't know you were going back to that)

(Ecoutez. Ecoutez.)
