[Verse 1]
Paragraph paralyzer rhythmic aristocrat
Mister rap it's the Gift of Gab about to twist your caps
Swift the fist so fast fury worry hit the switch ya ass
Its 'n bits 'n fragments so midget quit this diss ya ass
Sit ya ass down while I rip the tracks and spit the facts
Hit the grass--green, brown, or purple I'm the diplomat
Rip your raps, really you don't get the math
Just a half-breed phony rhymer, I was meant to rap into that
Fire breathing, rhyme heathen, kidnap your mental black
Hijack your fly dap or con head your intellect
Mind state, arrow blast, center crack, mind gaps
Blind from their eyes back, send ya back crying act up
A pencil pad, my utensil grab thine attention
Get hit so bad with jiu-jitsu stabs I avenge you
And if you rap I'ma send you back rappin' in a tavern
If you mad kid it's just too bad
Tell 'em it's the

I have asked America's foremost young poet to read his latest poem for us)

[Verse 2]
Hit you with the funk it's like, "who cut the provolone?"
Government officials put taps on my mobile phones
Nations overthrown hold my own on my zone
Prone to leave your dome blown poem after poem, homes
Jones for the tones roam with me turn your motor on
Overall this war just got it goin' on
Overgrown child never growin' old sowin' oats pokin' notes
Till the never nose ho overdose
On my flows those flows goes deep
Hold your nose bros knows foes yo don't sleep
Slow your roll, show my soul, total hold
Domination don't ya know
I'm the comet like Muhammad with the verbal rope-a-dope
It's the

Paragraph president
He's been sweeping the nation with a hard hitting campaign
Paragraph president
As a politician he regards himself as a national harmonizer
Paragraph president
And so mister president we urge you to do something about the deplorable
State of our nation

I pledge allegiance to the pen and the pad
And the mic and plates of America
And to the republic, kiss my ass
Thugs fakin, actin' hard to get this killer beef
That was given to me
I must bust it for all

[Verse 3]
Leave your city burnin' like Gomorrah
Stamina, blaze up your space, plus I got it on camera
And I'm a animal, animator landin' a
Blow cleaning clocks nothing left for the janitor
Punching through your granite a goodwill ambassador
From another planet I could kill and smash ya up
And it won't stop and I can't stop - better-er
Can erupt and it does had enough amateur?
A rammin' ya feel the goats horns slammin' ya
Ham it up every single time that I stand in a
Crowd of emcees backin' up when I'm actin' up
On a frenzy after ya yellin' "that's enough!"
And it tempts me, that it does, and I'm glad it does
When I flip see spatula style's stackin' up
Many big threes rappers on never catchin' up
Passin' up, ride passenger, is it black enough?
Spectacular! Now ya know who's attackin' ya
Crackin' up mashin' top mind capturer
I'm the
