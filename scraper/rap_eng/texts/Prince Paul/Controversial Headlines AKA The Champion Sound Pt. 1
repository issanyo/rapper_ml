[Hook 1: Horror City] {x2}
We're Horror City baby, we came to get down
We're here tonight to bring that champion sound, champion sound

[Hook 2]
It's Big Sup', Rhyme Va Lore and Paul
We came to rock for all of y'all
If you shot call or ball or brawl
Just get crunked out from wall to wall
I came to drop a rhyme or two
For the hustler, the thug in you
DJ give me a rub or two
Lovely ladies we loving you

[Verse One: Big Super Star]
I'm butt naked overseas on the beach
So far no worries or troubles, I'm out of reach
Lil' Kim bringing me drinks, heard she packs heat
Destiny's Child crunked out in my suite
Prince Paul let me find out [?]
Hey hey hey, Mr. D-D-DJ
Heard Juvenile's a mother, not really
Would Ray J be on if he wasn't Brandy's brother?
Trina bootie really fat like that? I wanna know her
Snoop really got rims on his lawn mower?
These questions motherfuckers be asking me, stuck
I don't know why, but I don't give a what what
Loved by the old school popping this
Like when L ripped a whole up in Canibus
I invented this
Apocalypse, black mist
Love when it gets ghetto fabulous

[Hook 1]

[Verse Two: Rhyme Va Lore]
"Va Lore what's good? Where you been at?
What you doing here? You still working at the shop? When your record gonna drop?
Yo How 'Pac make CD's with songs that new?
Do you think he still alive, yo you heard that new Clue?
I heard Nas dissed Jay, I heard Jay dissed Kiss
I heard Kiss had 30 thousand 'round his wrist
That's a whole lot of jewels huh?
I guess Snoop Dogg and Eminem is cool, huh?
You from the 'Ville, what's going on with De La?
Can you tell Paul to call me?
What's up with Poetic? Rest in peace to the god
Yo I heard Cash Money and No Limit be rolling."
"Yo B, I don't know, they all the way out there in New Orleans."
See this the type of questions motherfuckers be asking me
And every other day there's something different there has to be
A million better things for two people to talk about
But you gotta give the people what they want or they walking out
It's not about your ad, record sales or commercial
It's more about what the people find controversial
Controversy, risky business
Dead witness wanna tell my life story, in Horror City

[Hook 2]

[Verse Three:Big Super Star]
Six tricking, niggas
Politician as I cruise uptown, cop a pound, half a brick and
Catch me in Chicago on Navy Pier
With a trunk full of cargo
Copped from [?]

[Rhyme Va Lore]
You might find it kind of hard to understand my plan
Until you catch me in Japan hanging out with Jackie Chan
And so you know the kid got doe
We can talk about it in the front row at the Chris Rock Show
Or V.I.P. with Jermaine Dupri
At the [?] walking in behind Mary
And like sixteen girls
At the bar we drinking expensive wines
Reminising on the way we had to get it, through relentless times
From looking at Mr. Bookman, Thelma, JJ and Penny
Winnona lived on Natalie, Cameo earned a salary
A bullet through the window killed my mother's friend Valerie
I'm talking about Amnity-ville, Long Island
What else was you thinking?
Smoking, drugging or drinking
Choking, bugging or winking
Hope it wasn't just shrinking
No Bone Thug and linking
Ya open cousin you're pink in
I'm loc'ing, buzzing my mink in
