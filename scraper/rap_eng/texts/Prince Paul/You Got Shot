You got shot 'cause you knocked-knocked-knocked
Who's there? Another motherfuckin hard rock
You got shot 'cause you knocked-knocked-knocked
Who's there? Another motherfuckin hard rock
You got shot 'cause you knocked-knocked-knocked
Who's there? Another motherfuckin hard rock
You got shot 'cause you knocked-knocked-knocked
Who's there? Another motherfuckin hard rock

[Verse 1: Sha/Tru]
If you knock on my door, you better been there before
Cuz for trespassin, you know I got the cure
I sleep wit hot lead, and it'll be dawn 'fore dead
I'll let my girl go 'fore my gun leaves my bed
Every man want heaven, but no man want dead
As the Pope once said, 'fore the dread lost his head
So I keep my door locked, my gun cold-cocked
First nigga that knock, I'm lightin up the whole block
Test me not if you don't want to get hot
'Cause I have missing posters filled with all you hard rocks
And I suggest, if you don't want to get blessed
Just remember to wear your bulletproof vest

You got shot 'cause you knocked-knocked-knocked
Who's there? Another motherfuckin hard rock (BLAOW!)

[Verse 2: Tariq/Breeze]
It's showdown, brother, high noon, my soul questing
Like old Westerns, the low down gonna die soon
The Tru-Fake, you gonna fall to rock-bottom
When my Glock spot em, then, for you, snake, you gonna crawl
Crumbling, messing with me definitely humbling
Mumbling mercy, thirsty, I need to hear it
I need your spirit decimated, desecrated my core
I'm to the extreme, before you do your next scheme
Deserve to leave you suffering, you gots to get the payback
From her to me, your brother and your brother kid from way back
Ain't no shame in your drama, you will be feeling the heat
From you stealing my beat down to you gaming my mama
Aiming a bomb to finish with you, diminish/split you
You done pushed me, shit, I didn't even get to kill that pussy
But now I'm 'bout to kill it, fill it, spill it on this pavement
Your scream'll satisfy my Wes Craven

You got shot 'cause you knocked-knocked-knocked
Who's there? Another motherfuckin hard rock
You got shot 'cause you knocked-knocked-knocked
Who's there? Another motherfuckin hard rock

[Interlude: Breeze/Tariq]
Yo, word is bond son. I'm sayin, niggas, when I see that nigga, yo, that's my word. Shit is gonna be so real for that nigga. Yo, I'm saying! Yo...

[Verse 3: Sha/Tru (Breeze/Tariq)]
My cream I protect, your dreams I respect
My plan, that hard rock shit be snappin at your neck (ah!)
I thirst for beef, hot lead spells relief
So play your position, brave nigga, I'm the chief
And all that hard rock shit gon get you closer to redrum
And reachin for your pistol, I can say that's quite dumb
So leave it alone, you've been dethroned
That's only if your black ass wanna make it home

[Verse 4: Tariq/Breeze]
You're getting carried away with pallbearers, twist you
While I'm wetting, that be the way it's all clear with Mr. L
Gone, black, I'm telling him you was plotting for cheddar
To hell wit him, you forgotten, against my contract
We could do this like Judas, blast you with your style
Mastered it so foul, leave you clueless, like, "Who this?"
Karma caught you, kid, I'm fucking sicker than true lies
I'ma scorch a nigga, coming thicker with new rides
It's hard to live, knowing that you doin the same
Knowin about you and your game, let God forgive
I won't, see, I don't give a fuck son, I give a buck in gross earning
You eating the heat, and my toast burning

You got shot 'cause you knocked-knocked-knocked
Who's there? Another motherfuckin hard rock
You got shot 'cause you knocked-knocked-knocked
Who's there? Another mother- [*gunshots*]
