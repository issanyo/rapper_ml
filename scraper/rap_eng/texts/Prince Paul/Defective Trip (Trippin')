[Intro]
*coughing*
You alright, man?
Nah that nit dog
Word?
Shit was good, but was not it
Yo money, bet so check this muthafuckin hyperformic shit out
This is from molten rocks broken down in it's purest form
Have some of this, check this shit out
Let me try this shit

"How y'all feel out there? Aw Yeah"

[Verse 1: The Gatekeeper]
Wanna see something that can make you sick?
Stand in front a jet on the Gaza strip
I used to take puffs from a car, jet in my garage
Then I get blitzed from the charge
I felt my head swaying, my eyes in a daze
Felt balanced then off balance, I got drugs for days
A room full of smog
I dipped it in my dart then I threws it at my dog
I need another hit, hurry, quick, hurry, quick!
My high's taking sides and the shit's about to kick
I'm gasping for air, my vision disappears
I'm blinking and I'm thinking hmm yeah
Word, cause that's the shit I was hawking
So stay the fuck away cause I spit when I'm talking
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid punk
When I'm Trippin'

[Chorus: De La Soul sample]
"Life of the check can be stopped by accident
When you're trippin' (trippin' trippin' trippin') the wire of the"

[Verse 2: The Grym Reaper]
Some people like cheeba, some like brew
I get mad lifted off a gallon of glue
Pretty soon I spin like a top
In the middle of the room and the shit won't stop
Know what I see when I trip?
The rats in the basement all start to flip
All through my building from door to door
I swear there's a fire, so I piss on the floor
Now down the corridor was old fat Ned
Scheming on a blowjob from a crackhead
He was like, "Hey, want a piece little man?"
I was like, "Yo, I'm better off with my hand"
Oh shit, reality returns
I need another hit but the glue won't burn
I'm cuckoo and murderous, just plain nuts
Smoking Sodium Pentothal, cigarette butts and Trippin'

[Chorus: De La Soul sample]
"Life of the check can be stopped by accident
When you're trippin', trippin', trippin', trippin') the wire of the"

[Break: RZA]
Yo, pass it man

[Verse 3: RZArector]
'86 on the strip, aiyo my hands was rusty
Grym Reaper, Gatekeeper, my niggas let's get flusty
Leaky leaky, I feel the high from the stimuli
I'm acting two faced, like the signs of Gemini
My head keeps on spinning, constantly continuing
Two tabs of mescaline fucks up my adrenaline
I'm in a 'fuck that shit' and I can't escape it
It's like goo-goddamnit, I hate it
Sometimes I get blind from the grapes of the vine
The wine, it fucks up my mind every time
I'm going and all I wanna be doing is boning
But like a Dopefiend character of Donald Goines
I'm stuck, flipping, slipping
I'm tripping

Life of the check
Can be stopped by accident
When you're tripping
(Cause I'm Trippin')
