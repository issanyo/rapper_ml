[*lots of gunshots & people shouting*]

[*silence*]

[*EMT siren blaring, getting closer*]

[*heartbeat pulses under Tariq’s narration*]

TARIQ: Ah, damn, the pain! Ah, shit… Like they say… Every beginning must have an ending. Why’d it have to end this way? Laying here, looking back, tryna figure out how and why… How could someone so close to me hurt me so much? We were like brothers. Damn, look at Tru, man! I know he’s dead! I know it! If I make it, how can I explain this to my mom? My girl? Organization gon’ kill me anyway. Damn, I can’t live with this shit. Fuck it!

[*gun cocks*]

CROWD MEMBER: Oh, shit! He’s picking up a gun!

[*gunshot, people screaming, chaos, EMT siren*]

[*all fades*]

[*crowd noise returns*]

MALE MEDIC #1: Ehh, this one’s gone. Killed himself

MALE MEDIC #2: Hey, what about the other?

FEMALE MEDIC: I think he’ll pull through. Apparently, he was wearing a bulletproof vest

[*Tru laughs*]

TRU: Damn, I can’t believe this stupid motherfucker!
