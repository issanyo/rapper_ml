Trust me guys, it's all under control
The judge is my uncle, he'll take the
Insanity plea... oh yeah, don't foget
My retainer balance
Stressed full, try to avoid all impure thoughts
I am loosing my mind . . 
Ahh... fuck it!
Another day, another ducat
From here to Nantucket MC's kick the bucket
I'm rugged ruff flow-in' up till I bust
While other rappers is flatter than a white girl's butt
I manifest my name N' the reason I came in the first place
Word, shake your brain like an earthquake
A lot of people admit that I am raw
I cover my ass like a V-I-M store
My forms are real wicked like Dahmer
A whole mob of a lot of niggas is like a meal ticket
It's nowhere to run to, baby
It's nowhere to hide
