Catch you on the flipside
I'm slip slidin' away
The relationship died
Of natural causes
The stature of pauses rose from nose bleed and can't be patched up with gauzes
I was good to you for the most part
You joined the coast guard
Send me a postcard
You broke it off like a Toblerone
With an overgrown child with no home but a mobile phone
Opposites attract, composites detract
When two become one, someone got subtract... shh!
(sobbing)
Don't go, don't go
If you need alone time oh
No, no
I know you still love me
(more sobbing)
