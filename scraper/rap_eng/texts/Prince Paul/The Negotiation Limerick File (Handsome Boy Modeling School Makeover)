"Bet you're wondering what's been going on
Bet you think I've almost lost my mind"

My DJ's got the cuts and the beats are on
We're comin' with the limericks, and we're comin' strong
And the rhythm's on time, to every word and rhyme
When it comes to keep it real, I keep it really wrong

At the risk of sounding crass, I would like to mention
That I am well aware of your wack intentions
To usurp my prose you so-and-so
It's my primary bone of contention

I tell you, everybody, I've had it
With all these people with static
I'll go insane if it don't rain
Sucker MCs are problematic

I love it when you hit those switches
A curve ball's what my pitch is
So here weâ€”here we come
Like dum-ditty-dum
I keep all five boroughs in stitches

"You're right, man"

Sound, sound, sound, sound, sound, sound
Sound, sounds sweeter through the echoplex
It'll spin you around and throw you in a hex
Until you feel no pain inside your brain
All your worries are soothed by the sound effects

Read it in the Post and the Daily News
Listen everybody lets show improve
Don't let me begin about heroin
Living six feet deep just ain't the move

We're giving you soul power
I like it sweet and sour
When it comes to rhymes and beat designs
I'm at the control tower

Tell me what makes you so afraid
Of all these people you say you hate
Just give it one time for your mind
And let's try to negotiate
C'mon, let's try to negotiate
Let's try to negotiate

"Bet you're wondering what's been going on
Bet you think I've almost lost my mind
Bet you think I've almost lost my mind"
