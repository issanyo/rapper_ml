Brace yourself for the awesome and rare
The real, the right dynamite is in the atmosphere
As there's a time and place for everything that's under the sun
This is the time and the place that we have some fun
Now take a see to check the pedigree
Of the band that's spelled S-T-E-T
The rhymerator, Dee-Lite, the R-O-D
And on the keys, my brother D-P-C
Wise, Frukwan and my DJ Paul
We puttin competition back, up against the back of the wall
Me and the band that I just mention
Present to you a new invention

We-we-we-we regulate a Stets-a-flucture
So def, a listen to the structure
Formulate ya own, but please don't touch a
Good lookin out, we thank ya very much a
Heed this style on the cartwheel nightcha
Fight to the end, I bet we'll bust ya up
And ya welcome to a force that creeps
Slowly but surely, enough we'll defeat you, BREAK.....

Break: (*scratchin*)

Straight to the letter witta hip-hop band
Of America, London and even Japan
And you surely will admit by bein a fan
Nobody else does it like we can
To battle us is truly a gamble
Excellence is proven by example
The ladies smile while the bodies are in shamble
Back off Puba, this ya can't handle
The rhythm homeboy is definitely ringin
The beats and rhymes are the chords that are tinglin
So grab your girl, let's start the jam
For at the helm is a band who's in demand, BREAK.....

Break:

Go (x31)

Ch-ch-ch-champ wit the punch of a verbal grenade
And a rhyme that's equipped as a barricade
Cool and clever, crack I never
Wit my crew I will never sever
Brooklyn, New York is our home town
That is the place we always go down
And every night a party goes down
And when it starts, it never slows down
We boogie to the DJ's non-stop
To the sound of the Brooklyn hip-hop
And if you've ever seen Brooklyn rock
(*scratchin of 'Brooklyn'*) rocks it non-stop, BREAK........

Break:

Go Brooklyn (x15)

Point blank, our deliverance is me but smooth
Stands out like a winner at'cha favorite tune
All tension is released upon the call of the beat
As you rock along to a funky treat
Like a torch, we're keepin you active
Our rhythm will hold you captive
We're perfecters of the poem we sing
Marketing to the top with the style's that's addicting
No doubt, about what we capture
A-nother classical treasure
So productive and effective
Chuck it out as a jam that's spreading

It-it ain't nuttin like hip-hop music
You like it cos you choose it
Most DJ's won't refuse it
A lotta sucker MC's misuse it
Don't think that Stet can lose it
Too much to gain to abuse it
The name of the game is rapture
This song is complete and captured, BREAK.....
