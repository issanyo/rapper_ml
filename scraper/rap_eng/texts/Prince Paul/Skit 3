LAWNGE: Blaahh! Oh man, this album sucks, man they starting
To sound just
Like MC Shan's. I don't like it, I don't like it
MASE: I know, that jam 'Who Do U Worship'? What they on
Some old devilish
Shit or somethin'? What's up?
LAWNGE: 'Afro's got a slammin' beat, but what are they saying?
AUB: Yo... 'Afro's is... wack!
MASE: That's really cool, gee!
AUB: I don't like it
(WHAP!)
MASE: Why don't you stop [crocker] with him man!
LAWNGE: Listen, listen! I'm Hemroid! I'm the leader! Now put
The tape back
In and give me the tox!
