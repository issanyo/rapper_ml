[Intro] [Prince Paul on his voice mail]
Y'all know what time it is. Just leave a message

[Pissed off girlfriend]
Hi sweetie. It's me. Remember? Your girlfriend?
You know the one that you fuck from time to time
I call you, I e-mail you, I page you and yet, no phone call back
Why is it that I don't get a phone call?
Let's think. That god damn music of yours that's why
That comes first, not me
I know we've had this argument time and time again
But for some odd reason, over the past, how many years have we been together?
Music still comes first to you. Where do I fit in? When am I ever gonna fit in?

[Hook] [Truth Enola] (De La Soul)
Love
(Dealin' with the drama in your...)
Life
(Pressure from your queen)
You're holdin' me too...
Leave
(You can leave now)
Be all right
Love
(Dealin' with the drama in your...)
Life
(Pressure from your queen)
You're holdin' me...
Follow my lead
Be all right

[Verse One] [Truth Enola]
Drama queen, givin' a man
Best of the sex
Worst of the stress
Half of the love
Half the respect
Overstand your emotional moods
It's a blank
When it comes to my technical ways, gettin' bank
First message on my cell, "Daddy please come home."
Second message, "Daddy please, I don't wanna be alone."
Third message, "I know you fuckin' them bitches out there."
Forth message, "When you get home, I won't be there."
Lady, givin' me drama, more than my soul can accommodate
Watch your shit miss, I need some time away
A little liquor I'm
A little drunk I'm
Gonna wash away the way you front
When you know I spend a lot right (Right)
Hit the spot right (right)
Split your back right
Even lick your cat right
Fuckin' with you
Spectacular brain
End of the game
I'll probably be shackled and chained
Drama queen

[Hook] [Truth Enola]
Love
Life
You're holdin' me too tight
And if you up and leave
Still gonna be alright
Love
Life
You're holdin' me too tight
And if you up and leave
Still gonna be alright

[Verse Two] [Trugoy]
You made me hit you once and kick you out four times
And you're still in my two way lookin' for a lemon
Stay givin' me hell when all I want is peace, pussy and progress
To make our little shack/Shaq Shaquille
I hustle state to state, smugglin' two inches into studios
Just to cut the dope deal
You stand on my moods when you got your heels
Dead center on my back
Bitch get off me
You wanna 9 to 5 mono-typical Joe
Well I'm a 12 to 12 stereo, extra ordinary
You stay with your hands in my face which makes it very
Difficult not to reflex (reflex)
Picture me on The Source cover
Ike Turner smile big headline "Peaceful rapper goes wiiiild"
We at it again, it ain't gon' end
My niggas whisperin', "It must be the sex."
She's my drama queen

[Hook] [Truth Enola]
Love
Life
You're holdin' me too tight
And if you up and leave
Still gonna be alright
Love
Life
You're holdin' me too tight
And if you up and leave
Still gonna be alright

"Gotta change the way it's goin' down" - De La Soul 'Itzoweezee'

[Hook] [Truth Enola] (De la Soul) [x2]
Love (dealin' with the drama in your...)
Life (pressure from your queen)
You're holdin' me too tight
And if you up and leave
Still gonna be alright
Love
Life
You're holdin' me too tight
And if you up and leave
Still gonna be alright

[Outro] [Girlfriend talking]
You know what? You're probably there right now
You just got those god damn headphones on you can't hear me
I'm tired of this. I'm tellin' you this
I'm really fuckin' tired of it. I don't like coming second, to music okay?
