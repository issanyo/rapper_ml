[DIALOGUE]
TRU (w/ (sample)): Damn, everything getting cold. 'Cept for them bullet holes. That's the only thing hot... Why the fuck did he had to do this to me? (PAIN!) Why? Damn. Hmmm. (PAIN!) shit...

[Verse 1: Sha/Tru]
This is how it's all gon' end, fuck that
You bust at me? I'm busting back again
Feel the heat, ain't no way that you gon' fuckin win
Shiiiiit, I set fire to a fucking friend
Fried in the end, you think of death, you gon' think of me
With your last breath, it's how it's got to be
The shell brought me closer to my God-to-be
Hell brought me closer to my soul set free (PAIN!)
It's so much pain I'm almost giving up
Phlegm mixed wit blood is what I'm bringing up
"I hope I don't die" is what keep ringing up
"You better off dead," is what somebody saying
Now nigga, hold your head up, I'm only playing
Never prayed before, but I'm praying now (PAIN!)
Seen a flash of light and I'm going down
The last thing I seen, the crowd was gathering round (PAIN!)

[Interlude]
[*crowd sounds, EMT sirens*]
(PAIN!)

[Verse 2: Breeze/Tariq]
It got real with hot steel coming in
Cutting and jigging, digging deeper, aching
Keep awaking, the rest is long, but goddamn it
The pressure's strong, fucking pain, clutching my brain
Touching the vein's arteries, bleeding heavily
Part of me leaving steadily, getting harder to breathe
And yet I be still alive, I'ma make it, I will survive
I'ma take it to the next level, yo, I'm wilding
Do the vexed devil know my styling?
Held down, hell-bound gravity having me sinking
Thinking I'm a motherfuckin' man (PAIN!)
Got a brother stuck in a jam, drive my son
A buck and a scam, getting me, wetting me, crimson drenched
In my mind, son, I find some hymns entrenched
A lot of mournful, faint humming
Tomorrow's dawn, I swear that shit ain't coming

[Outro]
(PAIN!)
(PAIN!)
