See, those flowers, they need love
See, the bluebirds, they need love
See, the babies, they need love
All God's children, oh, need love
See, your mother, she needs love
And my father, he needs love
That's true, baby, and I need love too

See, those rain drop rivers, they need love
And the mountains and the valleys, they need love
God forgive us, and send us more love from above
Don't find good love every day; we ought to think
Before we throw good love away

Doesn't matter what you are
A thief, or a beggar, or even a superstar
As long as you were made by God above
Oh, I know, I know, you need love; we need love
Baby, oh, I need love, I need your love

(I'm standing here, ) oh baby, standing in the need of
Love, I need love
I need it; I got to have it, baby
Oh, can't you see that I'm standing in the need?
I'm still here 'cause I need love
I'm still with you, dear
Cause I need your love
And I know, oh yes, I know
Though you feel you don't need loving
You still need loving too, oh yes, you do

It don't matter, no, it doesn't matter what you are;
A thief, or a beggar, or a superstar
As long as the Lord made you from above
I know, I know
You were made for love ('cause love is what you need and understanding, ) oh, understanding
You were made for love, sweet understanding why can't we see we were made for love
You were made for love, baby; sweet understanding, why can't we see?

We, (you, ) were made for love
(Why is it so hard for us, today, to see the real?)
We were made from love; you were made of love
Baby; you were made to love, baby
What's the only thing that's gonna get us together?
(Love's the only thing that's gonna make this cold-blooded world alright.)

What is this we're singing about? For the love of Jesus, let's do it
I need a whole lot of love, sugar
I need a whole lot of sweet love

It's a fact
(Who?) Even the slightest thing needs love
(Who?) All of the folks in jail need love
(Who?) Even a mean old man needs love
