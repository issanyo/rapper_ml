"Everybody used to think of him as..
Well more like a bum, sort of, a musical bum..
Than anything else"

[Singing]
Your love, is my sanity
Your love, brings me sunshine
I like what you do to me
I like what you give to me
I wander through this world
Needing you so much
I wander through this world
Dreaming of your touch

[Both]
If I could see you again..
If I could just see you again..

Forget about your sorrows
Forget about your heartache
Life is nothing but a shadow
("Ooooh-weeee man!"}
Forget about your worries
Forget about the bad times
Life is nothing but a shadow..
("Ooooh-weeee man!"} ..without your sunshine

[Father Guido Sarducci]
Everybody's been wondering where you been
And, now that we know what happened
We're all wondering where you are
And even though we feel bad we won't be seein you around anymore
We want you to know we feel better, we won't have to worry anymore

[Singing]
There's a new star, in the night sky
Could it be you, making me so high
Shine on, shine on, shine on, shine on
Shine on and on and on and on and on..

[Both]
If I could see you again..
If I could just see you again..

Forget about your sorrows
Forget about your heartache
Life is nothing but a shadow
("Ooooh-weeee man!"}
Forget about your worries
Forget about the bad times
Life is nothing but a shadow..
("Ooooh-weeee man!"} ..without your sunshine

[Father Guido Sarducci]
We know your only worry now is
You worrying about us worrying about you
And even though we stopped worrying
It doesn't we're not still sad
And we're happy to let you know that, we always will be

[Sean Lennon]
I used to think time, was on my side
I used to think the world, could be so kind
That was another day..
That was another time..

[Both]
If I could see you again..
If I could just see you again..

Forget about your sorrows
Forget about your heartache
Life is nothing but a shadow
("Ooooh-weeee man!"}
Forget about your worries
Forget about the bad times
Life is nothing but a shadow..
("Ooooh-weeee man!"} ..without your sunshine
