[Verse One: Grym Reaper]
Ahh... fuckit! another day, another ducat
From here to nantucket mc's kick the bucket
I'm rugged ruff flow-in up till I bust
While other rappers is flatter than a white girl's butt
I manifest my name and the reason I came in the first place
Word shake your brain just like an earthquake
A lot of people admit that I am raw
I cover my ass like a v-i-m, store
My forms are real wicked like dahmer
A whole mob of a lot of niggas is like a meal ticket
It's nowhere to run to ba-bay
It's nowhere to hide
