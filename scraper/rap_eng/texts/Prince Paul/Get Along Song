[Verse 1: MC Paul Barman]
You're invited!
Mogul Mayfield hatched domino and Reagan unites a catch of common foe
It don't matter who said the wrong thang
We all get along
We're the Get Along Gang

[Hook 1]
Hang with the gang
Get loose the caboose
Chill with the skilled
Relax then act

[Verse 2: MC Paul Barman]
RSVP in Forrest City
For down-home loyalty in a brownstone sequoia tree
It's a joy to be a member where its safe to loose your temper
Even then were listening
You're a valued participate
Diss and break up
Then kiss and makeup
Shake hands I insist
Athletes, scientists, we make art with our hearts
Get up be a part
Of the brand new start of the Get Along Gang

[Hook 2]
Hang with the gang
Get loose the caboose
Chill with the skilled
Relax then act
Bounce with the town
Get loose with the moose
Glam with the lamb
Research with the beaver
(He's in the Get Along Gang)

[Interlude]
Oh boy I can't wait to join the Get Along Gang
Well, you and all your friends are invited
But what do we do
We go on all kinds of adventures

[Verse 3:MC Paul Barman]
Adventures from the Earth core to the North Pole
Break down barriers like the fourth wall
Kick a pine-cone, whistle, and whistle more
You got an invite from Mrs. Brisselmore
A boy whose mad at you shares the same attribute
He may shout and yell because he hates part of himself
How can he be aware of what he's not aware of
We spread light like a headlight when we share love
And the benefit benefit of the doubt
See all the end of it come out
You can be headstrong, dead wrong, still get along
And instead of saying I sang a song for you
THE BRAND NEW GET ALONG GANG

[Hook 3]
Hang with the gang
Get loose in the caboose
Chill with the skilled
Relax then act
React with the cat
Go a-gog with dog
Mix with M6
The Get Along Gang

Hang with the gang
Get loose in the caboose
Chill with the skilled
Relax then act
Hang with the gang
Get loose in the caboose
Chill with the skilled
The Get Along Gang
