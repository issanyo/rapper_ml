[Intro: Prince Paul/The Undertaker]
One, two, you're ready?
Yo, this one goes out to Prince Paul
My man Frukwan, The Gatekeeper
Prince Rakeem
And last but not least, The Grym Reaper
(Some motherfucker's out robbin' your home)

As your soul enters the next stage
Reality becomes obsolete
You have nothing to fear, nothin' to fear
Walking in the shadows you realize
That live is nothing but a form of animated death
(Gravediggaz)
And to my right is the one that they call, The Grym Reaper

[Verse 1: Too Poetic/The Grym Reaper]
Sparks through the dark, I'm diggin' in the dirt
Or diggin' in your brains or your skirt
Burying the past is a very hard task
I make loot and now everybody's diggin' up dirt
I spark the night like a rasta with reefer
And to my right is The Gatekeeper

[Verse 2: Frukwan/The Gatekeeper]
Here comes the one, the one wicked sun from the slums
That's how I do when the Gravedigga crew comes for
Example, leaving carcass bliss
Half hypnotized with my mark on their wrist
The protecta, spector of death, the selecta
It's the RZA, the RZA, yo RZArecta

[Verse 3: RZA/Rzarector]
The bloody, ferocious, attack, hits the body
Explosive diagnosis, it's fatal like multiple sclerosis
Oh it's, not the hocus-pocus
Gravedigga nigga, just to keep the focus
Fucking up the tracks like the Fist of the White Lotus
Catching trichinosis if you ever try to smoke this
(Gravediggaz, Gravediggaz)
