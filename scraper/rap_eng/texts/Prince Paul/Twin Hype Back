[Intro: Prince Paul as Chest Rockwell]
Now come over here and let me give you a tongue kiss on your hot pocket...

[Verse 1: El-P]
Me and Mike'll go Twin Hype and do a dance on your windpipes
Put your fucking jazz hands back in your pants and get them shits sliced
Caught the ghost when I was yay high so today I stay way high
Do not worry about my habits, without sin I'd probably hate life

[Verse 2: Killer Mike]
This is dope as that hard white you stuff in a crack pipe
A hit of this, a kid with Tourette's will chill out and act right
I'm fat but I dress nice and bitches finesse Mike
They suck the dick and squeeze on my belly like bagpipes

[Verse 3: El-P]
I slap and I suck clits, I fuck in my church shoes
Humblest guy in the room and I am in the room too (get it?)
I'll bend you over on the roof while whistling Audio Two
They say that once a girl go Brooklyn no more soft dick'll do

[Verse 4: Killer Mike]
I'm so Rakim and Eric B bitches check out my melody
I might Slick Rick on a fella (foul), catch me a felony
Hey, I might Shyne Po a ho, POW! Catch me a case
Producto must have rolled this L because this blunt feel laced

[Bridge: Chest Rockwell]
I must say you do look stunning
I mean, you're the kind of girl I can really see myself artificially inseminating
Oh I'm sorry, I'm being a little aggressive, right?
Can we start from the beginning?
My name is Chest Rockwell, right?
And I love to make love to your booty...hole
Bad boy

[Verse 5: El-P]
This is born alone die alone, so my dialogue's dastardly
Life's a tragedy generator operating at max capacity
This is porno for piraters, to the crooks it is relaxing
I am foreign to that soft talk, you can tell it from my accent

[Verse 6: Killer Mike]
This is arrogant fat black, it is what it is
This that stingy with dick bitch, not a fuck do I give
I'm no respecter of person, I'm no respecter of rules
I catch the Prince of England slipping
He goin' run me the jewels
I could wake up brain dead tomorrow and my soliloquy still will be
The illest there'll ever be cause I be what you'll never be
My pugnacious rhyme patterns prove pitbull in my pedigree
And dogs fight to the death
You say you better, you better be

[Verse 7: El-P]
Not one shit given, El-P's chillin'
Raised in a shack in the back of the village
Trained by the wolves in the woods
To avenge on the men who elected themselves my killers
Mike's a villain, Nick Hook's chillin'
We don't have a need to know your feelings
We don't believe in the same shit anyway
Run the Jewels is not for your children

[Outro: Chest Rockwell]
How you feeling now sweetheart? A little more relaxed?
Maybe it's that half a molly I put in your Mountain Dew
Yeah, works like a charm. Just chill out for a second, relax, relax, I got it under control
I got you a glass of Beefeater, I got a brand new deck of Uno cards...
Oh yeah baby, the night's just getting started
Ok, how about I come over tonight and pick you up in my brand new Segway
We can go over to Long John Silver's, get a fish platter
You can take me home and massage me with butter all on my neck
I love you
