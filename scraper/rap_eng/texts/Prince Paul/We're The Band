[Intro]
Read the lines
Read the lines

[Verse 1]
Read the lines as I write the script
About six young men who are fully equipped
To be the first rap fan in all the lands
So get a grip y'all, 'cause we're taking a stand
First in line and most likely to
First to conceive and first to do
Grandstand hip hop, Stetsa style
The style of the Stet, the bold, the wild
The free, the brave, the New York-made
We're Brooklyn-bred, Long Island-fed
Six-man parade, twelve-pocket paid
Musicians by trade who made the great
Living proof of tearing the roof off
Party peoples go to setting the course and of course
[?] and the six go hand in hand
And on stage, the Stat expand 'cause we're the band

[Break]
Straight to the source
Straight to the source
Straight to the source, straight to the source
Straight to the source, Straight to the source

[Verse 2]
Straight to the source for those who felt lost
Confused conclusions about our cause
Play back the track if you wanna unwind
As we begin to show and prove and define
Turn out the lights, come on, and pump the sound
Stetsasonic is back and ready to go down
Listen to the session, the missions, the lesson
That we rise up to the top of our profession
The night in light, the ladies delight
Stets in effect with a different type of hype
The band with a solution, Stets an institution
Here to make clear all misillusion
Not four, not three, not two, not one
The six of the fad is sons of fun
The tribe, the posse, the gang and the clan
Get the picture? We're the band

[Break]
Supreme ultimatum
Supreme ultimatum

[Verse 3]
Supreme ultimatum, Stet generator
The goal is bold but it's [?] to create a
Feel that appeals to the Stets's envy
What you think is opinion to most, is longevity
Vicious death, Stet the band I stress
Confident as a mole and a mole is just pressed
In gave the race that's deeply open
This is the force to make you doubt and soaken
Fragile and different, six men terrific
We elevate and upgrade a statistic
This rage of terror creates a new era
To crew who you thought was a group, wasn't
We're a hip band and a hop chance to ram
Down your throat and continue to grow
Like a title that I write on my notes
'Cause we're the band

[Break]
Pace
Ain't it funky?
