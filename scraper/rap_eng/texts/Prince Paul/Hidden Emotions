Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it

[Grym Reaper (Gatekeeper)]
Like the older you get the more you regret
(YaknowI'msayin, wanna know what we like?)
Do the knowledge, do the knowledge of this
Check it, yo

[Grym Reaper]
Ever watch a hard rock when he got a seed?
Turn a whole hundred and eighty degrees
The nigga that you never saw smile before
It's like the warrior at peace with the child at your door
It's mad wild how he holds the mold
It's so fragile knowin that this little soul is agile
Meanwhile deep in his thoughts
Is how do I protect it from the streets and the courts
There's stress and strain tryin to maintain
When you're poor workin odd jobs for small change
You either rap, rob, girls slob knobs
And niggas sell crack, weed or coke for the mob

[Gatekeeper]
The Al Corleone idol was his mentor, gangster
That came up short
You're needin dentures
Built his rep for killin Aztecs in distortion
Front page news for the projects
Carried the weight for his mom's operation
25 years workin for the train station
Cause he was black the community reacts
Summer tricks, picnic for kids, he gave it back
He ain't accept it, grinned and helped the church, clear his debit
Wind up helpin young brothers makin records
When the people lookin at cha from the outside
Open your mouth wide and say "Aiiight!"

Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it

[Gatekeeper]
People wonder why when my man died
I didn't even cry
Melted on the inside
Now I'm becomin like a runner
Sweatin like a plumber
My heart started poundin like thunder
Yo am I ready for revenge that depends
On how my future look in the bends
Is my life worth losin
My seed, my wife
Gettin my life snatched for makin wrong right

[Grym Reaper]
I was always on the calm tip
Last brother to harm or bomb shit
Now I'm on some real Vietnam shit
The quiet storm til the riot is on
I despise doin harm but my foes gotta be conquered
As I warn my peeps "Beware the beast that creep the streets"
Spillin your plasma on the concrete
Killin the murderer, acts of war
Villains attack the poor
Women and children pack heat now
Growin up I was sad young buck
Dad said "Son look don't become corrupt"
I knew he really meant well
To see me represent and excel
But yo the torments of hell lay dormant until
I try to escape out of the muck and the mire
Nearly got killed bein stuck in the fire
Like Jeremiah
I weep for my peeps gettin bucked from the streets to the choir

Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it

I'm lettin mines out
I can see through I can see through
Who you want me to believe you are?
Front shine and son knowin you're a fallen star
I see the look in your eyes when I pass you in my car
I been felt the vibe so I played you from afar
Your problem is you think too negative
It perpetuates your condition and cuts short your ambition
You're not a wicked one son
You need development
Don't worry when things are irrelevant
You need to let it out cause it could cause you bad health
Hidin your emotions could rob you from yourself
(Gravediggaz) Hide you from yourself

Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it
Hidden emotions, you and I control it
Don't get pissed cause this is how we show it

[Grym Reaper (Gatekeeper)]
Yeah
The older you get the more you regret
(Just let it out
If you can heed it, the only way to defeat it)
Hidden emotions, hidden emotions
(Is to let out what's hidden)
We all got em
Gotta let em shine
