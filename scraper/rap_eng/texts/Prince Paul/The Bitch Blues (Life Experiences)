[Verse 1]
I know this girl named Jan
She lives down south
She the only girl we know
Like to stick four dicks in her mouth
She drove one of my niggas
S'dogone crazy
The nigga dyed his hair gold
And swore he was Patrick Swayze
I know this nigga name, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Now he all fucked up
He ain't even got a buck
We knnow this girl named Jan
Tits fit right in the palm of your hand
Her clit is real small
She like to fuck in the sand
I got two friends that like her
And one friend that don't
And I'm the only black nigga
That likes to smoke coke

But it don't smell that bad
