[Skit]
Lemme holler at you for a second man
What's up man?
Fuck is this nigga man, you know he white rap
Nah, he just light skin

[Verse 1]
Everytime we on the road it's the same old thang
Dames wanna roll around, dudes wanna go hang
In South Dakota the promoter refused to see you sober
He had a bucket of herb [?]
Slung over each side of his shoulder
He said "Bet you can't smoke it all"
When I fell over homegirl broke my fall
Listen, Pissin' ointment isn't a dissapointment (squirt, squirt)
Shall we? I was way up her alley
Girls wanna be down, guys wanna be paley-waley

[Verse 2]
Male groupies stuck to tour bus windows like they're bugs (windshield wipers!)
Love letters turn into hate-mail when they don't get hugs
We love your back abstract, I believe you are my peers
Don't gotta be high end to be my friend
Got to have been friends for twenty five years
[?] rap a critic had girls and asked us to share 'em
So my man and I got separate hotel rooms and separate whole damn harems
When I was done one kissed my sons off another one's gums
Women wanna hump, men wanna be chums
DJ Paul made a song and asked me to get on it
Your girl wears a thong, it's got shit on it
My ego's so big, it takes ten days to sightsee
Ladies fall in lust, fellas like-me like-me

[Verse 3]
Yo son it's not all about pimps, whips and chicken heads
Or else you'll end up eatin' shrimp chips, sick in bed, skippin' meds
And lickin' eggs (Pow!)
I ain't scared of no psychotic bomb
My mom knows I love her, my fans know I'm a problem
And that's word to my peoples growing fat in New York City
What was once my third nipple's now a true forth titty
It's not [?] yet you continue to blunder
I gave 'em info
Women know, men wonder
