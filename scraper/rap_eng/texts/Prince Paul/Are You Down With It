Are you down with it?
Are you down with it?
Are you down with it?

In my words that I mend
Hand in hand, across the land
For the line in time
Peace of mind for all mankind

Yeah, right, you know how it is and if not, here's a pop quiz
Who's gonna strike first for better, for worse, well, that's us
And either with us or against us
So put up or shut up, it's kill or be killed
An eye for an eye, you're gonna get strung up
Like a P O W M I A in California
We're all going AWOL like fuckin' a holes
And there's shit on the flag and blood on the rainbows

Buildings fall after all but we're still livin'
Drop the bomb right or wrong but we're still livin'
Turn the page on the rage, I get down with it
Keep on dreamin' on, dreamin on'

Buildings fall after all but we're still livin'
Drop the bomb right or wrong but we're still livin'
Close your eyes, I'll surprise, I get down with it
Keep on dreamin' on, keep dreamin' on

Are you down with it?
Are you down with it?
You know

Peace and love, one truth
High above, no me or you
One side, one love
One way, which side are you on?

Oh, I'm sick of the smiles the Destiny's cChilds and being lied to
I'm sick of the boys and girls and being paid no mind to
I gotta look out for number one and that's me, a man with out a country
Who's lookin' out for me who's carvin' my name in a tree
Wouldn't be here without me, wouldn't sleep here without me
Couldn't die in the street here in the land of the free
Gotta try and find my Stars and Stripes
And be all I can muthafuckin' be

Buildings fall after all but we're still livin'
Drop the bomb right or wrong but we're still livin'
Turn the page on the rage, I get down with it
Keep on dreamin' on, dreamin' on'

Buildings fall after all but we're still livin'
Drop the bomb right or wrong but we're still livin'
Close your eyes, I'll surprise, I get down with it
Keep on dreamin' on, keep dreamin' on

Are you down with it?
Are you down with it?
You know

Are you down with it?
