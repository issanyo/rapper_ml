I hope this old train breaks down so I can take a walk around
And see there's no time you see cause time is just a melody
But the people in the streets walkin' fast as their feet can take 'em
I just rode through town
And though this window's got a view but the frame I'm looking through
Seems to have no concern for now, so for now

I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I need this here old train to breakdown

Well this engine screams out loud, centipede gonna crawl westbound
And I don't even make a sound cause it's gonna sting me to leave this town
And the people in the streets that I'll never get to meet
If these tracks don't bend somehow
And I got no time that I got to get to where I don't need to be, said

I need this here old train to breakdown
Oh please just let me please breakdown
I need this here old train to breakdown
Let me please breakdown

You know you can't stop nothing if you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind that you kept and you know
That you don't know nothing but you don't need to know
Cause all the wisdom's in the trees, not the glass windows
You can't stop wishin' if you don't let go
Of the things that you find and you lose and you know
But you keep on rolling, put the moment on hold
But the frames too bright with the blinds down low

You know you can't stop nothing if you got no control
Of the thoughts in your mind that you kept and you know
That you don't know nothing but you don't need to know
Cause all the wisdom's in the trees, not the glass windows
You can't stop wishin' if you don't let go
Of the things that you find and you lose and you know
But you keep on rolling, put the moment on hold
But the frames too bright with the blinds down low
