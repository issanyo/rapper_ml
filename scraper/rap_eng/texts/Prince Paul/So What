It's the return
Of the world's most famous [?]
Ladies and gentlemen
Funk extraordinaires
Ladies and gentlemen

West Coast, East Coast
Cocaine, check it out

What do you say to a man that brags about his car?
(So what?)
What do you say to a man that claims he's a rap star?
(So what?)
Bam-diddly-diddly-bam-ba-see
Isn't is a MC comin' up to me?
Then that he stuck up in my ear
Your halitosis is burnin' up my nose hairs

Why why why
Must we talk about your car
And your dope ass house
Why why why
Must you be braggin' about the dope
You be slangin' in the South
Why why why
Why you claim to be knockin' fools out
Why why why
Apparently you don't know what life's about
No no
Why why
Why why why
Ooh ooh

What do you say to a man that brags about his car?
(So what?)
And what do you say to a man that claims he's a rap star?
(So what?)
Burnin' up my lungs here, get out my face

Hey yo, same shit, different toilet
I can't call it
I'm just tryin' to have a good time
Nigga you tryin' to spoil it
Cause from the moment you walkin'
You shit-talkin'
Knowin' that these cats watchin'
And chicks hawkin'
Braggin' about that shit you own
A new pager and cellphone
The Benz on chrome, the brand new home
Talkin' shit like that's gonna get you stuck up
Ain't nobody impressed nigga, so shut the fuck up
I see you talkin' to the dime with the tight weave
Make sure you roll up your right sleeve
Ten more time before the night leave
To make sure she can see the wrist glisten
(Nice watch!)
Now you think you a baller, but just listen
Tired of you niggas tryin' to put on a show
I'm tired of you braggin' about the cars and dough
I'm tired of you talkin' about niggas you don't know
Wrote a song about it, wanna hear it? Well here it go
[Chorus]
What do you say to a man that claims he's the shiznit?
(So what?)
(All the felonious capers)
What do you say to a man that say he got a hit?
(So what?)
You ain't really makin' no paper
(Y'all ain't shit!)

Niggas always talkin' bout what they got
Niggas always talkin' bout how much they clock
Niggas always talkin' every way they go
I'm not impressed by you niggas, I just want you to know

Niggas always talkin' bout what they got
Niggas always talkin' bout how much they clock
Niggas always talkin' every way they go
I'm not impressed by you niggas, I just want you to know

I don't care about a bitch or a 6
Chris Don or a mode
All that shit just to show?
You can't take it when you go
I'm a survivor
And I only speak for the riders
And I don't wear Prada
Cause I think the horses are hotter

These other cats talkin' 'bout the jewels they got
I'm talkin' 'bout the jewels I got from the dudes I shot
Check my record, I made plenty niggas strip naked
You wouldn't expect it so when it happens,  just accept it

Locked up, I been there
Two years, I've done that
Sellin' cats run at
Or I'ma put you where a pun at
I love being me
Don't you wish you was me?
Could take a nigga key
And tell your friends it was weed?
I'm too much for this world
(Y'all can't stand me)
I look better than my girl
(Well goddamn it)
I was once a hot boy but now I'm a cold man
Only time y'all wanna brawl is all drunk and got the rams
I don't need any, this thug life isn't in me
I keep a pack of gum my gun and two jimmies
I wouldn't leave a block until I knocked my last rock off
Wishin' I could be that boy, drivin' with the top off

[Chorus]
What do you say to a man who claims he has all the girls?
(So what?)
Ooh-ooh
La-aah
La-aah
