[Verse 1: (?)]
Introducing my tools
The pen and paper I always use
To put people on the dance floor, out on a cruise
Beyond disco, or rhythm and blues
News from the pen is called pen news
View from the pen are called pen views
First was the pen, then came news
Folks heard the news and then came views
The pen's ink is the blood of the body of rhyme
The paper's the abode of where the rhyme unwinds
Together as a unit are paper and pen
My pen and paper blend, then I start rhymin'

[Verse 2: Frukwan]
Lyric is a formation of rhythm
Concept explained the song given on file
Is an act of honor
My pen and paper symbolize my armor
Explosive, just like a Stet show
An idea perfected by the ratio
Sentence is the place where two blend
(?) an idea when the mind meets pen upon paper
The ends explain the work
(?)
Making a sentence hurt
Can't make this king of paper and pen
Like six man band of hard writing men
Cause sucker is a person that rhymes on a tip
Biting the act, which makes him submit
On paper and pen, the greatest story
With the whole damn stock of rhyme inventory

[Verse 3: (?)]
Cliches
To keep you excited
The pen and paper, that's how I write it
Dope phrase
To keep you humming along
Cliches in a phase to another def song
Blueprint
To lay down on paper
It becomes clear that the pen does the labor
Paragraphs on the paper form composition
Pictures on paper are called hieroglyphics
Views on paper are called viewpoints
The news on paper, yo we're the joint
If you view the news
Pen and paper is funk
Get down one time and man we're awesome
