Now just sit back, and listen

Yo man, let me get a shot of vodka, straight up, no chaser
[?]
Yo, I had a rough day man
Yo, LeRoy man, let me get another drink man
I have to tell you man
Yo, you ever have a day, man, when absolutely nothing goes right?
[?] the wife is giving me problems
You know what I'm sayin', the old lady, I came home late last night
I was workin' late last night, you know, she think I'm out seein' other broads, man
[?]
Give me another drink man
Alright
Yeah man
Yo and then, to top it all off, I come to the office, the boss is on my ass
[?]
You know, he's up my ass
I mean, you know, I go out for lunch
And he's callin' me, pagin' me, wanting to know where I am man
[?]
What the fuck is with him man
Hey, give me another drink man
Man, you ever meet somebody, that
They just can't shut the fuck up man
They just keep talkin' to you and just keep talkin' to you, even when you...it's clear you're not listening to them no more, they still want to talk to you
[?]
Give me another drink man
Aww man, that [?] yeah, yeah man
Man
[?]

Give me another one
So anyway, um
What were we talkin' about there?  Ahhhh
Yo Paul
And my kids
Prince Paul man (Jesus Christ, these kids)
Is that you Terry? Good, don't, don't even think about it
Don't even think about it
Look, I love 'im, but he's just a pain in my ass
Let me get another drink, he's a pain in my ass
And then everyone's bothering me telling me that I drink too much
[?]
And that's just the thing that fuckin' pisses me
When the glass is empty, put a little more in it there
You know what I'm sayin'
[?]
And ah
Oh, the bottle's, the bottle's empty?  You gotta go downstairs to get another bottle?
Alright
[?]

Hi baby
[?]
Hey not bad for a 2000 year old man
[?]

Do try to escape, escape from yourself
You try everything, movies, television Zen Buddhism, travel
But wherever you go, you go to, and spoil everything

I don't know man, just give me another drink
Yo, Paul, I don't know what the fuck, you know Prince Paul man?
Isn't he just the weirdest?
