[Gatekeeper]
Back in the ghetto it rained for 40 days
Ear like slain but I can't show no pain
My headache, enormous proportions is the size of a bucket
Pain killers can't touch it, yo
What my little brother's gone
Now I'm torn apart as I stand with the knife at my heart
We shared the good and the bad times
When moms broke out to the store it was halftime
Remember she came back yo
And we got beatings with the Hot Wheels track
I felt the hurt from your own predicament
Lost your scholarship
Can't play pro ball with torn ligaments
Career suddenly ended, your goal was offended
Suicide deft tips recomended to try black
But you and I verse as we bless the earth
So let us pour the wine preventin suicide

[Grym Reaper]
Nicole strolled away from home at age 12
In search of herself she found an angel of hell
Who deceived her like Eve and convinced her to leave her family
You could see she was very naive
The fallacy she was taught was brainwashed thoughts
In a cult with no culture, soon she was forced
Into showing her skin tones for thin grins and moans
To please her saviour Jim Jones
Her pops was a ex-marine, him and his team
Got M-16's so they could blow up the scene
"No tambourine beatin deacon is freakin my seed every weekend
As long as I'm breathin"
They parachuted in
Started shootin men recruited by Jim
Grabbed Nicole and threw her into the trunk
She was that close to drinkin the punch
And realized false prophets lead to suicide

[Rzarector]
I was born in the bed of thorns
Surrounded by men with horns, wicked forms
But still I was happy to be born
I grew up in a house of ten
Of mouse and men, rats and roaches lackin oxygen
Every night I dreamed I saw ghosts
Babies cryin, David uncles dyin, mom's tryin, pop's lyin
Mom's goin across his head with a frying pan
Me and my man made plans to rule the land and raise a fam
Now my man stands six feet deep in a box covered with sand
Tears are droppin, niggas droppin off
Droppin out the 2 to 5 smokin plus
Do or die suicide
About to face a bid cause I tried to erase this kid
Made him to embrace the biscuits in my face
Pull it back erase it kid
Pull the trigger, but I figure
That I got a little RZA
Can't let him get trapped by the evil wizards
Wicked men apply genocide, homicide for you and I to try
Won't figure this out til you die
