[Posdnuos]
I was born in the Boogie Down catscan, when my building…

[Biz Markie]
Nah, I’m not even going for that this time
You got to kick that new—you ain’t been out for years
Why you gon’ be actin’ like that on this track?
Kick some old funk joint like this…AH!

[Verse 1: Posdnuos]
You know P-O-S-D-N-U-O-S
Usually the reason for a cardiac arrest
The back off you silly hardcore wannabes
Plug’ll fly to blow that ass from the ground like stacks of leaves
(Check the sleeves) Not a trick when sniffin’ in my word ‘cause
(Only practice makes a real jam) Heard
I’m just a man without the man con tan
‘Cause my tan been sittin’ in my DNA plan
I’m a rap fan who never saw Bam rock the parks in the Bronx
Yet I still snap skulls in the dark
I can raise mad heads in the sky without a tool
Which requires a clip to play a nigga for a fool
I be the blessed cheer for an upset ear
Who had to hear “Say ‘ho’” forty times
‘Cause I’m…(So fresh)
Yep, you heard from the one of many queens
Who dissed The Educated Rapper when I was just a teen
Back then fame was just a dream
But now I be the physical scream shoving speaks for weeks
And as for the girls like the Crew that Crash, I adore
So let’s put the chorus to the floor
Girls, girls, girls, girls, reach out and clap your hands
I be the fabulous man, so just play the fabulous fan
And bring the breeze, bring the breeze

[Hook: Biz Markie]
Gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)

[Verse 2: Biz Markie]
It’s the Biz Markie as you can see
You know I got more rhymes than Muhammad Ali
That’s why I rock the mic and I’m in control
This is a rhyme dedicated to De La Soul
I’m the M-izza, M-izza, M-izza, A, A, R
R-izza, R-izza, R-izza, K, K
I’m not Jack, Jill, John or the Marvin, ay
But hey, I rock the mic and I’ll break your day
The B-I-Z M-izza A-R-K-I-with the E
And every record that I make I’m rockin’ history
Hey, you know me as the man that go “ah, ah, ah, oh”
It don’t matter ‘cause you know I got pull
I rock the microphone down, I’m rockin’ Gotham town
I do a dooga, dooga, dooga with the funky sound
Hey, hey, you know it’s me, the R in rhythm-B
The hip, the hop, I rock the microphone and I do, G
Hey, they want me go crazy, they want me go nuts
They want me rock the funky rhymes for the big ol’ butts
No, um, I got to do what I could what I could do
‘Cause I’m down with the rhythm of the De La crew
Native Tongue, gotta give a shout to my man Tip
Bound to wreck your body and rock the ship
So check me out without a doubt, you like the way
That I could rock it to the rhythm with all the blasé
M-izza A, R, R, R-izza, K
The man appointed rap king of rock break of day
Hey, ‘member in Long Island when I used to kick
Yo, I gotta stop, gotta stop (Rock) quick

[Hook: Biz Markie]
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
I gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)
Gotta rock it, don’t stop it (“Gotta rock it, don’t stop”)

[Verse 3: Trugoy]
Hey, see ya tomorrow, it’s the early bird
Silly Chattanooga got the shits for your curb
What’s a million bucks if your life is disturbed?
Who’s in the shade if you’re picking up the third
Listen, duck duck goose, watch the cockle-doo with ‘Nuos
‘Cause ain’t no stiff behavin’ when you’re David
Mister Party Maker but only to my peers
You could say ‘My niggas’ but daughter’s open ears
So put a sticker on it, and dig it, doggone it
Respects to the Biz ‘cause he is who he is
Let me catch my pace, give me sugar, Mase *scratches*
Oh, you’re just so ridiculous
I gots to move it like a U-Haul, give me a call
7-8-9, oh shit, that’s my behind
Lovely how I let my mind float
Now I’mma take my baaad ass home ‘cause I’m a goat
