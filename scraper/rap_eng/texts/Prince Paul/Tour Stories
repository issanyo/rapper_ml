"we tryin' to represent real hip hop worldwide
We been on this tour damn near two months you know what I'm sayin?"

[Verse 1: A-Plus]
Ain't no way to count all the flights I'm takin'
Chillin' in Australia with them white Jamaicans
In Tokyo I wasn't relaxin' when I smoked
They throw the book at you if they catch you with a roach
International ladies be givin' up the numbers
Homie get around like Christopher Columbus
And they know I'll be back like Arnold
Act carnal soon as I slam the car door...
That's hard fo' a lot of brothers but not me
You could watch the Travel Channel probably spot me
And I'm very thankful I ain't gotta be cocky
But I'm flyer than a motherf**ker somebody stop me

(we used to read about this never thought it'd be real
Now we all in planes trains and automobiles)

[Verse 2: Opio]
Me I be relaxin' though skiing in Jackson Hole
Eating baked Alaskan steaming a bag o' droll
Schemin' on stacks of dough either it's fast or slow
Steadily as we go better react
Now you could walk like a zombie or monster mash
While your braindead mommy give me all the cash
Get that fake broad freakin' like Nate Dogg singin'
Without the grapes or the eight ball drinkin'
Playboy Bunnies with O' snappin' pictures
Cuz I got the gift of gab like Blackalicious
And your African princess acting different
If you ever disrespect youâ€™ll have to get shit checked

[Verse 3: Tajai]
It's pandemonimum when Souls touch down
Bus like the grey goose that shit is home for now
Buzzed off the Grey Goose then the Patron come out
Woods roll way loose and they flowin' around
And Woods whole day booze when I'm patrollin' the crowd
Cuz they can hold they booze and fo' sho goin' put out
I used to stand in they shoes and hope to get out
Fools had to pay dues finally broke us some ground
Now my toes'll touch ground, where the seasons is opposite
I done folded some pounds I done folded some bassam yen
From rockin' it yeah rockin' it
And I'm back to rock again that's the best part about the sh*t

[Verse 4: Phesto]
Sweet for her cuz she made porn
Orange Crush broke down and they sore Wow, stay torn
Went from transport trans to Astro vans
Never had no plans to Sambo man my fam won't flam
Freaknik'n passed out in Amsterdam
Sugar water got a mule kick em' back on land
Uncle Ron played the guitar for forty years
Said he never been around the world like us his eyes teared
When we took the learjet before we got our ears wet
All across the hemisphere and we ain't even there yet
Clear net to the Tascam twenty minute set four mics intersect
Tours heighten intellect
