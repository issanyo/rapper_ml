[Verse 1: The Grym Reaper]
Beware! Four figures appear through the fog
Yeah, Gravediggaz cut like sword... AHHHHHH
Fear makes ya brain go numb
You ain’t got a clue where the gods come from
I told myself to exist and then I fled over
Millions of sperm cells and I found the egg
No luck or mere chance
I came to enhance represent and get open as a vent

[Verse 2: The Gatekeeper]
Psychopathic, a deep thoracic
Gravediggaz have mastered putting niggas in caskets
Blowing like the wind, when I’m in my spin
You got fucked across the path of the twister
You face the storm and bring it on
And get chopped in the blocks from Hitchcock
The Birds, my mental ward is my brainstorm
Somehow I flipped and came equipped with a chainsaw

[Verse 3: The Grym Reaper]
Mixing gravy pays my rent for the day
Some hate the image that I must portray
Critics say, "Go to Hell", I go, "Yeah
Stupid motherfucker I’m already here"
Frustrated, mentally aggravated
To be the rebel that society created
I’m good most times but when I’m foul then I’m flagrant
Living in the shadows like a government agent

[Verse 4: The Gatekeeper]
I'm one side of the story
Shit cooked up from Gravediggaz laboratory
Transferring brains with remains of a slug
Let the Undertaker make the beats that’s bugged
Path we're creating splitting genes
Chopping necks with the fat guillotines
I’m your nightmare, fright with the worst
One verse will put your ass in my black hearse

[Verse 5: RZArector]
RZArector, ha ha ha ha, ha ha ha ha
Hooah, hooah, hooah, hoo!
Danger, enter the Graveyard Chamber
It’s like someone digging inside your ear with a hanger
I inject my poisonous stinger to your finger
Of all your life forces, I’ll drain ya
I’m blood thirsty, thirsty for sure
About to blood suck the same ones who blood suck the poor
You’re not safe any more
To all the holy spooks, I declare war
I’ll gravedig them up from Hell, RZArect them
From the poisonous worms of swine, I disinfect them
Positive Energy Activates Constant Elevation
Positive Energy Activates Constant Elevation

[Outro: The Gatekeeper]
Out of the darkness
Out of the deep of the darkness
Lies the Gravediggaz
From the parts unknown
The world that’s unknown
People fear what they don’t understand
So, this is why we’re here
To explain that there’s nothing to be afraid of
Have no fear, Gravediggaz are here
