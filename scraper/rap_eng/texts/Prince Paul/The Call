TARIQ: [*sigh*] Aight, then, I’ll see

TARIQ (NARRATION): Now, it’s off to Tru’s house to call my girl, Tammy. This definitely would not be the first time she bailed me out of a situation. She’s gonna wanna know why we both not going to work. I can’t tell her it’s my first day hustling. All I know is that I had to think of something, quick

[*sound of Tru watching TV*]

TRU: Ayo, it’s next to the bed

[*Tariq walks over to the phone*]

TARIQ: Aight, man, I’ma call. But this ain’t gon’ be easy
