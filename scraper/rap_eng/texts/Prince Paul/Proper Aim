[Tajai]
Uhh, the deadly pedigree leave little for editing
Thoughts of deadin me inevitably put you ahead of me
I'm steadily battering your chicanery
With battery after battery BLAST your smattering
To smithereens, y'all ain't as tough as y'all appear to be
Kinda queer to me (HI!) soft lyrically, scared of triggery
Get to steppin cause I'm quick to check 'em with the Heckler
In the chip and peppers restin next to my pecker
I stress the maximum effort; I can't relax cause I'm reppin
So face the fact that I'm fresher and take it back to the essence
With my spectacular methods of slayin tracks with a vengeance
Send 'em packin when attacked with an immaculate sentence
It's Tajai

[A-Plus]
Let me introduce myself, my name is A-Plus
No need to check 'em, I got big ol' ape nuts
I'm in love with hip-hop, it ain't lust
Whenever we drop, people they thank us
Can't stand rapper a talkin shit but cain't bust
The flamethrower hit 'em up and makes dust
Tell 'em fold, I'm workin with a straight flush
Get to steppin before you miss the late bus
You lame fucks wanna get your frame touched
I hear 'em talkin but they ain't sayin much
A jump to that mission to make bucks
Niggas done came up but listen it ain't luck
I'm A1 mayne, you? You can't cut
The same stuff you some lower grade huff
Fiends tried your dope and no one stayed up
Maybe cause your flow and your show is straight butt!

[Hook]
It's not a game, nobody playin
We can drop your whole team with a proper aim
Nobody playin, know what I'm sayin?
Souls of Mischief got a beam on a lot of lames
They all the same, that's why we came
We can drop your whole team with the proper aim
It's not a game, nobody playin
Know what I'm sayin?

[Opio]
Op don't need amphetamine
Op is an adrenaline fiend, Op live for the filthy scheme
Op gotta get the fettu-cine, similar to Medellin
Cartel, you never met a king
That's pushin with a head of steam like I'm Edgerrin James
Biggest Kilimanjaro bantamweight spaghetti green
They whylin in the mezzanine with a heavy chain
Follow to your limousine, stuck you like a nicotine patch
My reaction time is like a matador
If it seem imagined or inflated, check your vantage point
In-between the inconvenient truth you can't afford it
Hey! When it's me it's guaranteed like the planet's orbit

[Phesto]
Yeah she leave yo {?}, geometric patterns
Tattoed on a battle wound, red Phes' rocker
Deep my gastric juices, battery acid
Placid opacity capacity massive
Tenacious assassin in dark glasses
Sasketchewan to TexArkana spark advancements
My hallmark art enhancement, often transmit
From the ballpark, transit, for start ransom
Parkin lot dance a lot, bound to cop a pound of pot
Off the countertop and cops canceled out the counter plot
Hoes serve, but think fast it's impulse
To the motor nerve, it's mo' to burn, quarter germ

[Hook]
