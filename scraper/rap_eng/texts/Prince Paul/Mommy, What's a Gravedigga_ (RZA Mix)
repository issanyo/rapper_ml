Mommy, what's a Gravedigga? (7x)

[The Undertaker]
As your soul enters the next stage reality becomes obsolete
You have nothing to fear, nothing to fear

[Rzarector]
Yo I had a nightmare that I slept for a light year
And a thousand locusts had crawled inside my right ear
Then I found myself trapped inside of a circle
Surrounded by forty wicked women who was all dressed in purple
They promised they would harm the nation with the abominations
The fortifications, indoctrinations of intoxications
At that moment I realized who was my opponent
It was Gog from a Magog, he said he wanted to slay God
He brought out his rapture from Ezekiel's 39th chapter
He wanted to fracture my skull, so they could capture my soul
My body got drawn to a life left deformed
As my essence try to squeeze through the crack of dawn
But I got trapped in a void, watching thousands of paranoid
Humanoids who was floating in space like asteroids
The pain in my head was excruciating
It must've been that dust that had me hallucinating
That I was facing Satan
And he was debatin with Reagan over who killed Kennedy
And the true identity of the Holy Ghost Trinity
And lack of masculinity
About to lose it, flashed back to blunts dipped in honey
And the first jewels that I mastered when I learned 120
About who's the original universal father
The cream of civilization, the biochemical author
It was me, it struck me, it caused me to figure
And realize to myself
That I'm a Gravedigga

[Grym Reaper]
Sparks through the dark by diggin in the Earth
Or digging in your brains on your skirt
Burying the past is a very hard task
I made cash and now everybody's digging up dirt
I spark the mic like a rasta with reefer
Darkness and light both bleed out the speaker
The Reaper's context is not complex
I reflect intellect, Gatekeep is up next

[Gatekeeper]
Here comes the one, the one wicked son from the tomb
Bodies are consumed as I rip the immune
Collected subject, vocals are perfected
Devils know I'm hectic, foes are disconnected
Your brainwashed state narrate, new mark hits the target
I cut you open wide like a carpet
The terrorizer, the murderous could slither
A knife across your back as you're screaming Gravediggaz

Mommy, what's a Gravedigga? (4x)

[Gatekeeper]
I transform 85ers, devils and connivers
Wanna step to this you spit out blood like a geyser
A gusher, I guess you couldn't mess with the pressure
I stroll the globe in pursuit of the oppressor
Obliterate, disintegrate type theories in a manner
And transform like Bruce Banner
Gatekeeper executioner, not vegetarian
Varying bloodthirsty the barbarian

[Grym Reaper]
I don't come to justify all of my words
I just come to crush the lies that you was served
Turning your devotion to old hymn the number ten
You was washed in the blood of a lamb to be cleansed
So I'm Grym, as I pass the pork chops, clocks a benz
Your moms and your pops are singing the gospel hymns
Dropping jewels on a mentally enslave figures
Who dig up the tracks of a Gravedigga
