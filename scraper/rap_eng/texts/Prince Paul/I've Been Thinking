[Cat Power]
Be my boy, be my boy
Be my boy, be my boy

Be my boy, be my boy
Be my boy, be my boy

I've been thinking about those things you said
I've been thinking about those things we did
I've been thinking about those things you do
I've been thinking about those things you made me do too

Be my boy, be my boy
Be my boy, be my boy

I was hypnotized
By your fairy eyes
Like a tiger in the dark
You were hungry from the start

Be my boy, be my boy
Be my boy, be my boy

Diamonds, candy pills
One million dollar bills
You can try
But you can't buy me, buy me

Diamonds, candy pills
One million dollar bills
You can try
But you can't buy me

You can slide slide
Slippity slide
Hip hop
And don't stop
I'll never be
On my knees

You can slide slide
Slippity slide
You can hip hop
And don't stop
Cause I'll never be
On my knees

When I saw you on the street
I just had to look away
You were so sweet
Sexy Steez
Laid back, relaxed
Street boy please
Wait a second it's gonna take awhile

Slide slide
Slippity slide
You can hip hop
And don't stop
I'll never be
On my knees

You can slide slide
Slippity slide
You can hip hop
And don't stop
I'll never be
On my knees

I've been thinking 'bout
Why you act so proud
I've been thinking 'bout
What's this shit about
Am I losin' control
Am I losin' my soul
Just tell me am I losin' you

Be my boy, be my boy
Be my boy, be my boy

Be my boy, be my boy
Be my boy, be my boy

Diamonds, candy pills
One million dollar bills
You can try
But you can't buy me

You can slide slide
Slippity slide
You can hip hop
And don't stop
Cause I'll never be
On my knees

You can slide slide
Slippity slide
You can hip hop
And don't stop
Cause I'll never be
On my knees

I've been thinking 'bout
I've been thinking about
I've been thinking 'bout
I've been thinking about
Losing you
