[Prince Paul]
You all have three minutes to do what you all wanna do
Yo, so speak as free as possible

[Chorus]
Check the clock!
Watch me!
Come on!
Funky!

Repeat

[Plug 2]
Bright everyday I wake up
Look at my travels they stuffed up
Ring go the telly which I pick up
Turn on the news as it screws up
Mase on the line to see if I'm up
Wrong thing to do at 5, I hang up
Lay on the floor sit and think up
Why the whole world alone is messed up

[Chorus]

[Plug 1]
Woke up the same morning I felt fine
Took me a shower I smelled fine
Checked out the weather it looked fine
Made some breakfast, I cooked fine
My girl calls me, she's so fine
Wanted me to help her go find
Some shoes but I had work to define
And it was Tuesday, I had to take P-Fine

[Chorus]

[Plug 2]
Folks styling jokes get the time set
Movement of the tune growing and set
Positive it is and perfectly set
Soul go to show soon we all set
Slipping lunatics shipping one set
Meet us for these now we upset
Chance to spread word we at full set
Rhythym weighs more than your weight set
3 will be the number till sunset
Plug 1 & 2 now we all set
Dove praises flow in your headset
Flow De La Flow there is no threat
Categories carry difference in sets
Differences are equal to an offset
De La from the Soul and its kept set
Soul is the revivor, Masey you set?

[Bridge]
Watch me!
Put it there!
You got to get it!
Get it!
Shout now!

[Plug 1]
My name's Posdnous and I'm above sink
The world is so out of synch
A lot of emcees can't play synch
That's why unfortunately they sink
But problem and speak are no way synch
We wash problems like hands in a sink
I hate to make this rhyme leave synch
But the reason De La bad is cuz we think

It took us a time but the crew's here
Activate a dance when you hear
A roll from the Soul like this here
And respond to the bond that assists here
Politics of speaking are intended here
And the president of paragraph will end it here
Cuz the 3 has completely lured here
That freedom of speak is assured here

[Plug 2]
Folly set the frequency in your show
While

[Prince Paul]
Yo, you all only had 3 minutes!
