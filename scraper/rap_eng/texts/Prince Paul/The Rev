POLICE CAPTAIN: Hey! What’s all the commotion in here? Tariq Jenkins, you have a visitor

TARIQ: Reverend!

THE REV: The captain explained to me what happened here. You know your mother is worried to death about you

TARIQ: Reverend, I can explain

THE REV: The captain already told me, Tariq! You’re such a good young man… How could you let the Devil’s way manipulate you?

TARIQ: I don’t know, Reverend

THE REV: Well, I told your mother I’d talk to you before I got you out

TARIQ: Yes, Reverend
