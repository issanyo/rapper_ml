That's why I was to get tore up on I Am I Be. That rhymed. Ummm... Qu'est que c ? Yo, man, they dissed me in the Source, man, they gave me no credit for my songs. For the Slick Rick stuff. Gave ____ credit for songs I did. That's a diss. I'm mad. Man. I hate ____ and I hate ____. And you can quote me. And you can record this and put this on a record. I hate em, I hate em. And I'mma get em. If it's the last thing I do. Anyway, hope you have a pleasant day. Peace
