[Intro]
Biofeedback

[Verse 1: Pos + Des]
Ya go "ichi, ni, san shi"
I can't cook, but being a cook I'm servin' much to eat
I got multiple stabs of jazzy
Sassafrassy as I caught the fame of soul
Years after mama had me tell ya gladly
I plugged for the Tunin'
Which cause eyes to zoom in
Which put your person into focus
No longer Kelvin Mercer but the Posdnuos
Plug One yo I found fun
In the scribblin' of speak
On a naked white sheet
Most recognized by my dark-brown self
Yo you found some wealth?
More in my mind than in my pocket
But I's got every Girbaud that ever sagged
I met some hoes, met some girls
Did a tour that took me all around the world
Did a tour that took me all around the world

[Verse 2: Dove]
I hit the shines but I'm shooin' it now
Remember when the floor might have had a spine
Well it's all bent over
The DayGlo nigga gets the red door mat
It's a roller coaster when your shit's burnt toast
Now Mr. Club Owner knows your jam
When your jam is the jam and there's a tab at the bar
My mindstate's great, no thanks I don't drink
I sip the bobo, then I kettle it quick
I felt the heave in the jeave, tap it in the basement
Diggin' my own understanding quick
Let me get the single out
Think Mr. Radio say the starlight
Is the same star bright
I'm thinkin' how a nine and a blunt is a switch
But turn out the lights and some will go bitch
It was one MC after one MC
Play the lamp post do the blow wit dynomite
Well it's okay and it's alright
Cause our birthday cake's external light
It'll all get graphic
People made of plastic
Look at the shine wit my 50 Watt eye
But when I got the eye patch I hit the latch
I fame it to a name from Denver up to Maine
And lovin' deluxe, she won't catch me in no tux
Nah, man I won't honor the style

Break: Dres +"Shorty" + [Sample]
(Serious, serious, serious, serious)
Yo, shorty! Oh my goodness
How you doing, my name is Dres, listen-
Oh, isn't that Posdnuos? Oh, my God, yo
Honey you are-
Yo wassup,yo,  man
Look, what's wrong with me? Honey, heck this out
Da da da dun dun
Da da da dun dun
Da dun dun (Dun dun dun dun)
Da da dun da da dun da da dun dun (Da da dun dun)

[Post-break: Pos]
Funny funny how time flies
When you have some

[Verse 3: Pos]
Light on the face cause the focus is the fickle
'Stead of fusin' I'm a use it to the utilize the trickle
Caught aa rush, but I played hush
While Andres Titus is the grabbin'
As a fan will put the hearts to mush
Lush Dalea would hear the public beat
The same way for Titus when he Blacked the Sheep
But as the Knee went Deep, to deeper off the charts
The album faded to black, that's when the amnesia starts

Break: Dres +"Shorty" + [Sample]
(Serious, serious, serious, serious)
Aren't you Dres from Black Sheep?
Oh my god, what are you doing here?
Who are you here with?
I'm with my man Pos, you know Pos
Oh yeah, Positive K yo, I like your music

(Stickabush, stickabush, stickabush, stickabush)

[Verse 4: Dove]
Hey boy, I watch that star man, shit's all in
Should I shot it or begin
I saw bootleggas no shinin'
I saw Big 4 go get shinin'
A typical flick was the moment
When the man said
"Ain't you?" Yeah I is 'im
Hush your mouth fallin' in cog
Caught the light being True dog
A fist of funk and I pocket that screen
In the scene or in between
Gimme but a little bit of the starlight
I mail my ass to the darkness
I dig it, I dug it, I dig it, I dug it
I wiz it, I was it, I wiz it, I was it
Oh Lord let me switch it off
Because ya find some'll do it all
For the light
(Stop jivin')
