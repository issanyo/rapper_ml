Alright it's getting really close to the election day
I'm voting please don't cut off my section eight
As soon as pastor pass the collection plate
I'm like shit I'm trying to stack for a escalade
But pay your tithes, time's money
I divise wise cunning little plans
To withstand when cats drive by funny
Like I ain't got what he got I don't play that
Nigga we fade cats that don't fuck with j-cats
You're trying to act like a boss save it patna

And you know that money for the baby

Cause I can flow like donovaon bro sound supersonic
Pouring gin and tonic with some chronic to blow

The lawless warrior William Wallace
Rappin' 'till I get a million dollars
Like home girl strippin still in college
Trying to get paper'd up

Rock the mic in your favorite club
Rock flavors like haters might step on the the gators right? shit...
From the bay to decatur the mic motivator hold a mic like yoda hold a saber
You know the flavor watch your behaviors
Cool I'm off to Handsome Boy Modelling School
And best believe I got a locker full of Vodka and Backwoods
