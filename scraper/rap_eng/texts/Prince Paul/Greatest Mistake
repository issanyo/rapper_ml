Open up your eyes baby
Let the truth and sun shine in
One day, one day, one day you’ll understand
You’ll grow up and you’ll see
There’s a truth between friends and enemies

And I should have listened to my intuition of the way
When your moves and your moods were saying
They were sayin’ no more, no more, no more, no more
Can’t stick around until you take me down
And I’m alone and dealing
With the confusion that I’m feeling

I made the greatest mistake of my life
When I let you get away baby
And I, I made the greatest mistake
And still am, still am, still am

I can see clearly
That there’s no love lost between us
Misguided, lost child I pray, I pray for you
I hope that your lies can keep you warm

Oh if I, I could rewind the time
And keep those records playin’, playin’, playin'
I say play on, play on, play on, play on
About the love we never left behind
Forget about the broken hearted
We got to pick up where we started

I made the greatest mistake of my life
When I let you get away baby
And I, I made the greatest mistake
And still am, still am, still am

Wish I read the writing on the wall we made around us now baby
Mistakes can turn your world go round and build it up and tear it down baby

I made the greatest mistake of my life
When I let you get away baby
I made the greatest mistake of my life
Make the greatest mistake
And it’s still there, still there, still there

I made the greatest mistake of my life
I never should have let you get away baby
I made the greatest mistake of my life
Make the greatest mistake
And you’re the real thing, the real thing

Still am

I made the greatest mistake of my life
When I let you get away baby
