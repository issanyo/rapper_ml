[Intro]
Look, there goes Dexter
And there goes his sister, Dee Dee
Oh boy, wonder what they're gonna get into today

[Hook]
Uh oh back to da lab again
Oh no back to da lab again
We messed up back to da lab again
Not again back to da lab again
(2x)
Uh oh

[Verse 1]
Dexters in da lab again
Makin' up anything he's' imaginin'
There goes Dee Dee, his sister
He always argues with her
She thinks she knows it all 'cause she's older and she's bigger
What ever Dexter wants, he just goes and creates
Robots, it doesn't matter the size or da shape
He's always doin' crazy tests and makin' a mess
And if they don't come out correct
Boy you know what happens next

[Hook]
Uh oh back to da lab again
Oh no back to da lab again
We messed up back to da lab again
Not again back to da lab again
(2x)
Uh oh

[Verse 2]
Dexters laboratory he can always count on it
To get him into trouble or to get him out of it
Sometimes if he needs Dee Dee then he'll use her
But Dexter's only true best friend is his computer
It's always alot of fun when you experiment
Dexter wit all his new acting experience
So tune into Dexter the worlds youngest inventor
So you can join him for his crazy adventures

[Hook]
Uh oh back to da lab again
Oh no back to da lab again
We messed up back to da lab again
Not again back to da lab again
(2x)
Uh oh

[Outro]
