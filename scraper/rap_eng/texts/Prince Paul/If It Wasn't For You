This is the story of you, what makes you special, where you come from
This is one of the most exciting stories ever told
Because it's about you
And you are one of the most important things in this world, you

She ride 'cuz her testament has been day one
A nigga got trust 'cuz she been day one
They one's done, build a fam Bruce Lee
So we K-I-S the BS goodbye

Damsel in distress so I stress good guy
Tarzan and Jane more like Bonnie and Karem
Could you be my sugar water, tonic and cream?
Put the dean in my yard, like religion and king

And diamond you a sight
Like unidentified rims spinning in the night
Me without your balance just wouldn't sit right
Like written wouldn't be past tense without ten

If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you
If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you

Hey, because of you my little lady named fame
People spot me like nerves spot pain
You put the S on my chest and inside my veins
Before that this darkie had to smile for them to see me

Now them same kids that used to diss wanna be me
Due to me being down with you
Hooked up in 82' plus six when you gave me my fix
You fixed my house and banking accounts
You fixed me up with too many women to count

Only right for you to have your side niggas too
And even when you don't come back
At least when you was here for me
The world cheered from you

If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you
If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you

Pen you my muthafucka, I'm a hold you like piss
Even when the itchy burn make me wanna let go
There you go smudgin', see actin' mad funny
But you kissin' loose leafs so I can't be mad

You my confidant when I couldn't tell pops that report card came
You signed off with me
So when the checks come you'll be signin' off with me
But when I'm dead and gone will you sign off?

Oh, Paper mate you light like paper weight
But you pack ink, can make tattoos turn pussy
And when it's mush time you be there like a man
In my hand spillin' my heart with you blood

If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you
If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you

You're my first born, my little Capricorn kid
Slid in this world at one pound eight ounce
My miracle baby grown in to a little lady
So fast, like pressing the gas while the tape bounce

Through you, me and your grandfather grew closer
I understand now, all he try to give for me
I wanna give it to you the same way
But sometimes fall short and you still live for me

I just want you to know
I may not show all the right feelings or say the right words
But you're my little black diamond
And always shining in my heart and that's way beyond words

If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you
If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you

You've been with me on the inside homie
Puff life in me ever since I was a knee high, I knew I had heart
Ain't gang related but you relative to blood
AB negative you represent love

Though you break like Pringles, you're heroic in your size
You make David beat Goliath, you heart beaker
Broads love you on Valentines day
Quaker brought beats to my chest before hip hop
Just take some time to remember

If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you
If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you

If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you
If it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you, if it wasn't for you
I need you
