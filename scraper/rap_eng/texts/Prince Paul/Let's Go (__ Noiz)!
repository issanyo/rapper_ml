Chorus: É Noiz! Let’s Go!

[Verse 1: Gorila Urbano]

Boom, Coming with that talk of the third
Voice of the unheard
Smoke out Frank and Myrrh to choke out the blur
Flying high in the Brooklyn sky
Styling wild, on the beat Vai-Vai
Straight from Brasil licensed to ill
I kill Bill at will with no frills
No fillers just a raw fella
Old school rebel a cause with no pause
No gloss no floss self-made man don’t call me no boss
I bless up let the rest fall back
Soul intact go head and hold fast
A love supreme for the ones that’s passed
You know my team I get cream with the best
And at your request it’s Ladybug Mek

[Verse 2: Mariana d'Ossãe (Ladybug Mecca)]

Indigenous disgraced right in front of your eyes
Let the dirt below my feet boost me up to the sky
Then take rise and I take what’s mine
Not all the empty reasons coming to light
Peep the ancient hoop kicks rock the bamboo knockers
Public access dutty whine out to rockers
Shrewd if I have to move with a laughter
Mood unsaid and my love is adaptive
Make em clap to this make em pay a fee make a plea to dark matter
I’m present in the essence so nothing else matters see
She a fighter set fires so wicked I spit and twist it like so
Observe the feeling heal it then go


[Chorus: Mariana d'Ossãe + Gorila Urbano]

Let’s Go! É Noiz!
É Noiz! Let’s Go!
