CHORUS:
Off wit ya head (x)8

[Verse One: The Gatekeeper]
Yo, aaaarrgh as I step out the depths
Yo, my reputation is known for bloody objects
The GateKeep prevails
I'm hard as the lyrics on the holy grail
Pick up your skull and blow of the feathers
Yo, I'm on a viking hike for buried treasures
The insane, terror remains out ya brain
Stalk the whole range from the darkest plains
It is I a homicidal we crazy coming at ya
Like an invasion of the what? body snatchers
I'm in ya dreams ya thoughts yo, everywhere you walk
When you speak that's the Gravedigga talk
The devils approached and get roast
Can't plant seeds on a grave with dead folks
From the darkest level of death
Rza, pass the shovel and step

[Verse Two: RZArector]
Check it, check it
Up from the bottomless pit this is it
Undertaker make beats and shit that sound sick
Me I be the mental disturbed, call the doctor
See if they got the nerve to try to stop the
Crazy crucial booming sound that's inhuman
Scream when I sting that ass like Paul Newman
Somebody knock on wood (knock, knock, knock)
All boys in the hood (drop, drop, drop)
When I come through with the shovel don't puzzle
Then I'm out the trouble, motherfuckin' trouble
So like Barney Rubble, back to the gravel pit
Smoke a fat spliff on the graveyard shift
Off with ya head, off with ya head
I wanna go where the buffaloes roam
Chop off ya head while I'm puffing on a bone
Yo I got a stack I'm never slacking in my macking
Styles go back to the days of Bob Backlund
Catch 'em in a suplex oh no who's next?
To get wrecked pass the shovel and step

INTERLUDE:
Hey y'all feel out there
Now we are ready if you are ready, ah yeah
Ah, ah, check this out
Yo, you can't fuck around wit death boy
Death will take you away and forget it
Unless you John Wayne or somebody who can kick death's ass

[Verse Three: The Grym Reaper]
Uhh, Gravedigga rites so enforce the night
Foes are froze likes deers in bright lights
I maintain my reign for godbody god frame
Niggas are runnin' like Ichabod Crane
Grym Reap is deep as the Lochness
Whenever I'm seen rocking teens, queens drop their jeans
I stomp too to rain over the crews
Like Monsoon with the lyrical force of typhoon
Doom is quick cause when the God attacks
90 years later you find the artifacts buried in wax
Frozen left on displayed, covered in the ash like Pompeii
As you enter the dark like Jurassic Park
You in search of devils with no hearts
Cardiac arrest from stress is the cause of death
RzaRect pass the shovel and step

[Verse Four: RZArector]
Yo, slap me five on the black hand side
The styles I devise is kept to terrorize
Don't be afraid of the dark watch me spark a flow
That got my crew rippin' up the charts
Cause I come ferociously no one is close to me
I bag bitches like I'm bagging up groceries
Now get binoculars so you can clock the
Popular hip-hop phantom of the opera
Now should I say "figaro, figaro'
The next thing you know I got a pocket full of dough
Yo and what did you expect choppin' mad necks
Pass the shovel and step

Outro: [RZArector], (The Gatekeeper)
[Uh, word, Gravediggaz boy from the grave, yeah]
(It ain't no cure chop the bodies all over the floor) (x)4
[Better bring your holy water and crosses]
