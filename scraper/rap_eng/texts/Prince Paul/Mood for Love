[Verse 1: Don Newkirk]
There I go, there I go, there I go, there I go
Pretty baby, you are the soul who snaps my control
Such a funny thing, but every time you're near me
I never can behave
You give me a smile and then I'm wrapped up in your magic
There's music all around me, crazy music
Music that keeps calling me so very close to you
Turns me a slave
Come and do with me any little thing you want to
Anything, baby, just let me get next to you
Am I insane or do I really see Heaven in your eyes?
Bright as stars that shine up above, you're in the clear blue sky
How I worry about you
Just can't live my life without you, baby, come here
Don't have no fear, oh, is there a wonder why
I'm really feeling in the mood for love

[Break]

[Verse 2: Don Newkirk]
This little dream might fade away
There I go I'm talking out of my head again
Oh, baby, won't you come and put our two hearts together?
That would make me strong and brave
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
If there's a cloud up above us, go on and let it rain
I'm sure our love together can endure a hurricane
Oh, my baby, won't you please let me love you
And give you relief from this awful misery?

[Verse 3: Female Singer]
What is all this talk, about loving me, my sweet?
I am not afraid, not anymore
Not like before, don't you understand me?
Won't you please pull yourself together? do it soon
My soul's on fire, come on and take me
I'll be what you make me, my darling, my sweet

[Verse 4: Sweet Dee (Breeze)]
Uh, I'm loving you from the first look
Like Mobb Deep, you got me all shook, uh
(Yeah, your love is real good, honey
It even feels better 'cause I didn't pay money)

[Verse 5: Don Newkirk]
Oh, baby, you make me feel so good
Let me take you by the hand
Come let us visit out there in that, new promised land
And maybe there, we can find a cool place
To keep our loving state of mind
I'm so tired of being without love
Never knowing what love is about
Hey, Mr. Houston, you come on in man
And you can cut now if you want to
We're through
(Yeah)
