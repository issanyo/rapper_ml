[Verse 1: Abstrakt]
Blood splatters in lateral, hit collateral
Body parts are parted in part of a field of catapults
Infallible, flow is logical like quantum physics is
A mind equal only to that of a wanted physicist
Caught eating porridge on the porch of a poor porn star
Stole her car tore out the security system, OnStar
It’s clear that this adolescent flow is unheard of
Crosses inverted, making sure to offend the newly converted
Semen inserted, perverted priest who’s assertive
Over teen anus; it’s heinous, I know, his goals are insertive
This is a place where your faith can’t save you
You’re tied up and gagged now, so who you gonna pray to?
Now if I catch you running it’s best to be certain
I’ll slice your meat curtains so have a seat, courtesy
Of me, I got a Gatorade refilled with Windex
Pour it down, fuck around, you open up to incest
You princess, shit, you’re fucking nasty get off of me
You’re calling me you’re making every day look like its Halloween
Let’s not forget, not only are you kooky but you smell like dookie
You’re better off as sloppy seconds for my man Boogie
You’re so stupid that you’re leaving me speechless
Kind of like how Puff did to Krabs, I repeat this
Here eat this, it’ll make you feel better that’s a promise
Just kidding, it’s a sandwich full of mayo and my friends’ pubes
You say ew, but you know you’re just another dirty hooch
That’s not an invite, to me you’re still a surly pooch (Ooh)
Now pink is getting stinky, I’d recommend some Vagisil
But in your case you’re gonna need a window sill
Alright enough is enough
