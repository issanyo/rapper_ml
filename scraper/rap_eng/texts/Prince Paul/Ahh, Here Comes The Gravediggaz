[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen give it up to the top notch
Stepping up not merely stepping over
Let’s here it for the “Gravediggaz”

[Hook 1: Frukwan]
Yo we going to dig ya grave (4x)

[Verse 1: Poetic]
Boo, you little bastards, rappers are in a casket
Situation is drastic, you’re under the plastic
Compound fracture, huh, my skill a sing
I’m rugged as the cross on a hill far away
As you react and shake to the track
I make rappers will evacuate
Cause I pack weight like
When bad I bury my vocabulary is, hahahaha, mad scary
The Grym Reaper appears I drink Redrum
Dead bones will cover the stage like bread crumbs
All I gonna say to ya’ll brave niggas is
(Ahhh!) I’m a Gravedigga

[Hook: RZA]
Yo, it ain’t safe, it ain’t safe no more
Yo, it ain’t safe no more
Oh, it ain’t safe, it ain’t safe no more
Yo, it ain’t safe no more

[Verse 2: RZA]
I was born deep in the valley of death where I stay hard
A buck mad child was raised in the graveyard
Straight from the darkness, I strike you regardless
Of who? It’s obvious, my crew can demolish
Lounge in a burial ground point my death spot
I built my house on top of Salem’s Lot
Crazier than Hitler, boy how could you figure
Yaaaaah! That you could mess with a Gravedigga

[Hook 1: Frukwan]
Yo, we going to dig ya grave (4x)

[Verse 3: Frukwan]
The homicidal Gatekeeper, death is my speaker
I live in the dead zone, my graves getting deeper
The killer my gates, are closed for those basing
The Undertaker chase niggas like Jason
Master of death, I hold your breath
Like a ghost, G-Drink more blood than Bela Lugosi
Been in more dreams than Freddy prepare to get ready
Lilly was my mother and my brothers name is Eddie Monster
I’m liver than the hell raiser
Sport a black long blazer, chilling in the morgue
I’m insane with the trigger, raaaaaaaha! The Gravedigga

[Outro]
Meanwhile back in a jungle
