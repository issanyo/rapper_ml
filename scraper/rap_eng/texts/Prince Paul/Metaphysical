Metaphysical style
M.A.H.O
Metaphysical style
With the good day style

[Miho Hatori]
Hyposes scientifical parabolus, milytical projectile punctured
Chronicle moderate bisected, injected refractions
Computating thoughts through a terament of ground stored in a floppy
T 1 line connect, intersect riding brain waves
Like a silver surfer whale is molding hand
Perforating a family of swords
I get metaphysical

It's a good day

Good day
Metaphysical style
M.A.H.O
Metaphysical style
With the good day style

And the fabulous clothes you wear
And the way you weave your hair

[Miho Hatori]
Investor's toxic fumigation symmetry cochlear resort
And want to express a way through u.s. skull piece
Rat-tat-tatering of the industrian austral domes
In the form of the cats and the dogs
Defogging the mind's eye's view
In the never ending quest for Cheddar
Just call me mini as the bar ages and the fries
And for room service nervous infections
And ticks in the metaphysical landscape

It's a good day [x8]

[Mike D]
Good day
Good day

Epical-lyptic fusion equips secondary solved processes
Interjection over introspection, (hmm?)
Reflective imagery burned into the cornea of
Inter-dimensional trans-global marketing schemes
Lube, dreams culminating over fribrontal poetry
Intertwining sheet music epic in proportion
Rhythmatic implosions inclusive with the masses
I get metaphysical

It's a good day
