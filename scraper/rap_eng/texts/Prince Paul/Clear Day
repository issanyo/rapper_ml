[Verse 1: The Last Emperor]
Yeah, you know I'm checking it out
I wanna know what it's really about
How they exit the party, cold kicking it loud
How the man on the right, be motivating the crowd
How they only exist at the top of the list
For the holiday season I be the popular gift
If I can kick it like this with an adventurous twist
The Last Emp will get chips without the ice on his wrist
I got rhymes you can keep, you can pump in your jeep
Or you can kick to your kids when you put em to sleep
I am the creature from the deeper [?] to the beat
When summoned by the drums I comes from beneath
So I pack up my throne, and I'm ready to go
Constantly in search of this lost city of gold
Somewhere down the road I met a man who was old
When I asked for directions, this is what I was told

[Refrain: The Peddlers]
On a clear day
Rise and look around you

[Verse 2: The Last Emperor]
Cooling in a crib, banging beats in my room
I hit the streets and I'm released from my toll
And as I walk down the streets, rocking to the beat
I get inspired by the lies of the people I meet
See someone'll hold me, then try to control me
Someone'd like to de-thrown me, but they can't overthrow me
Some pretend to be friends, then act like they don't know me
Was it a slump until I bumped into a couple of homies

[Trugoy the Dove]
I made my way through the scariest blocks, and various spots
And know the first names of the area's cops
I meet Shawna, selling her soul on the street corner
Had to run away from her father that beat on her
It's sad, but I still got a few of them news clips
She ran track, right #1 on a school's list
Now she's standing out on the stroll with a bruised wrist
And just then my cellphone ringed and opposed this

[Masta Ace]
After it all sets in, the next time's gonna be a sin
I pinched my skin just to see whether I was out
(She's not in her dreams anymore)
But how was that, clouds and kaleidoscopes
(How'd they hide the ropes?)
He's using see-through training to swing on the balance
Talents have my momma in the air before she bare her child
Pedophiles for her optic and identified
Admission under raps for the first MC to fly

[Refrain]

[Verse 3:]
They said once I was airborne they'd just shoot me down, in six, five
Don't they realize that I was destined to hold joints griptight like arm wrestlers
Vessel my flight into airwaves and pain
A little bit of frontlaws and all
(Suburbian style)
Happens like comics, we swing beats for leisure aspects
Past this, them dudes we done paid em
(We melting the Metropolis quicker than chocolate)

[Masta Ace]
I got the dunk when these kids start bursting, the world worsen with every shot
Hit every person on every block
The summers is very hot and not in the forecast
Giuliani got more gats with his law pass
But now that it's shooting season they hoping for a reason to stop your breathing
Straight leaving ya moms grieving
Yesterday I got stopped frisk and I got this cause I got this
And I'm only alive cause a cop missed

[Last Emperor]
Now, Masta Ace came to set the party off
Trugoy came to set the party off
We ain't Tough Tonys, but ain't hardly soft
And we rock more shows than sid at Mardi Gras
Well, I hope you've come to see, you don't want none of me
My observations date back to the electric company
To some degree, what I looked for was right in front of me
Boys and girls around the world acompan thee
Cause they know that, today's show was sponsored by Dove and Ace
And the magic number three
