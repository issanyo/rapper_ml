You know it's been about four years since I graduated
From the Handsome Boy Modeling School

And I just want to say that their 60 dollar course has changed my life
Since my graduation I've traveled to Prague, Milan, Paris
And Buffalo New York

And I now drive a fifty thousand dollar LaForce Automobile
With total suede package, with subwoofers
And specially designed custom glass rims

Also, in my closet, shoes, so many shoes you can't believe
And next to it a drawer with the socks, full of the socks
More than enough for each pair of shoes, yes that's a many

And the women, let me tell you, the women, my God
I can't go in through the details, but all I could say is
I know all about the secret garden

So let me just say, "Thank you" from nearby the bottom of my heart
To Nate and Chest for showing me that beauty is truly
In the eye of the tiger
