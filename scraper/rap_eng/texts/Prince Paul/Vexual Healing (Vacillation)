The child was as black as a raisin, and her hair looked like, looked like it'd been burnt in the desert
Nuff respect

Here it is

Let me tell you what happened at my job
Working for the boss, you know
And how come she stress me so?
Lord, I say to her
Boss lady, me know want no trouble, me just want to work, d'ya hear?
She said, "Black girl, get down on your knees and you clean the bathroom"
So rasclat lady, I bash upon your head!

The child was as black as a raisin, and her hair looked like, looked like it'd been burnt in the desert.  It was burnt off completely.  I mean, I couldn't see the child, she had nice teeth though

Jump high rope, jump

And she came in and I said "Holy shit, man, this is the child?
This is her?"
I mean, she was a very, very tacky, very drab dresser
Very drab
14 maybe, yes, maybe
She constantly said, that she was 17
And she really, really liked me when she came over
'Cause I did not lie about myself
Like she did on the phone
That's why, oh my God, it was that made me mad, because her people...they don't know who this child is
And I usually keep a cute one around, you know?

From Jamaica man, this would not be a very good question
Even to ask then
Because, there's tings that go on in Jamaica, all day like this here
Nuff respect
