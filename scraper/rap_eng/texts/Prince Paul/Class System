[Intro: Pharrell]
La la la la la la la

[Verse 1: Julee Cruise]
Yes, I got it all
Prestige, class, fortune
Good help is so hard to find
Except my tennis pro
(My husband doesn't know)

[Hook: Pharrell] x2
They're all trapped in the system
Unbeknownst to them they're trapped with no glass
Hello there

[Verse 2: Julee Cruise]
I give to many charities
It's just a tax write off
They breed, just like rats it seems
Why don't they get a job

[Hook]

[Interlude]
I mean really it's so simple for them
I mean we're the ones paying the rent
And the food and..all the taxes
My God what more do they want

[Julee Cruise]
Money Money Money Money Money
Money Money Money Money Money
It makes the world go round

[Hook]

[Outro]
I was bred to be special
You're not one of us
So don't try to fit in
We'll just laugh you away
I get meloncholy sometimes
My shrink says im repressed
I'm just like my mother I guess
Same class, wealth...bland husband
