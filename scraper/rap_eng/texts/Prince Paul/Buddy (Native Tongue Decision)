[Dove + (Q-Tip)]
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany, mean
(Oh, you gotta do that again, Dove)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany (Say what?)
Meany, meany, meany, meany, meany, mean (OK)

Hello, it's the Soul
Troopin' in wit the Jungle patrol
And this one's about the KO's, the knockouts out there
Who I call my buddy
Hold up (Wait a minute)

[Pos]
Now just wait
We're gonna talk about Buddy on this plate
But before we let the herd out the gate
Make sure the all the levels are straight out
(The Jungle, the Jungle, the Brothers, the Brothers)

[Afrika]
De La Soul, on a roll
Black medallions, no gold
Hangin' out wit Pos, hangin' out wit Mase
Buddy buddy buddy all in my face

[Mike G]
For the lap, Jimbrowski must wear a cap
Just in case the young girl likes to clap
Ain't for the wind but before I begin
I initiate the buddy with a slap

[Phife]
Now drop the beat, for the Phifer from A Tribe Called Quest
When I see Buddy, I will never half step
I just do her Tribal style and then jet
The Buddy that I like is to be sexy and nice
Just good enough for the one they call Phife
A brown skin Buddy with shoulder length hair
Nice firm breasts and a round derrierre

[Q-Tip]
Now for the next, I'm the Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest
And if you quest for the Buddy, don't fess
If your jimmy wants nothing but the best (the best)
The best (Ooh Wee!)
Let's stick out the jimmy and see what we can catch
(Stick 'em up, stick 'em up jimmy)
Nets won't be needed unless
(Jenny wanna get right to the flesh)

[Afrika]
Dancin' on the dance floor
Girl, it's you that I adore
Step off stage, you scream for more
Native Tongues got rhymes galore

[Mike G]
Snap my fingers, make you mine
If not, I'll snap a second time
After that, I guarantee
You will be standing next to me

[Afrika]
Fly buddy (buddy) don't you know you make me go nutty (nutty)
I'm so glad that you're not a fuddy duddy (duddy)
Not too skinny and not too chubby (chubby)
Soft like silly putty
Miss Crabtree (Crabtree), I know that you're not mad at me (at me)
Cuz I told you that it was your buddy (buddy)
That was making me ever so horny (horny)
Junglelistically horny

[Pos]
I won't lie, I love B-U-D-D-Y
Cause I never let it walk on by
When it comes to me and Jenny, I seem (very serious)
Like a peek freen
Buddy is an act that occurs on the lift
When Jimmy and Jenny start shootin the gift
Boy let me get shot, I won't even riff

[Dove {Q-Tip}]
On the dial, my Buddy talks to me for a while
Plug Two is the {Q to her Tip}
On the A-side or sometimes the flip (word up)
Buddy, is the bud to my daisy tree (uh huh)
And the luden to my do-re-mi
And the pleaser to my man Plug Three
(Plug Three gets the whole caboodle)

[Mike G]
Behind the bush, my Buddy likes the way that I push
And like a champ, just knock it on out
Never ever once sellin' out
(Well let loose the juice)
My Buddy helps me to (De La my Soul)
Keepin Jimmy in total control
Without Buddy, I'd be on a roll

[Monie Love]
Now as the lady
I thought that Jungle and Quest and Soul would just maybe
Give me the chance to say that I get crazy
Due to the fact I let Buddy amaze me
As a matter of fact, it crazes me in many ways
I decided that it was time for Monie Love to say
That when it comes to the B, you know that I don't play
'Cause to me chasin Buddy is the perfect way (perfect way)
To spend the day (to spend the day)

[Q-Tip and Queen Latifah]
Oooh child, things are gettin a little easier
Oooh Buddy gets easier (yeah)
Oooh child, things are gettin a little easier
Oooh Buddy gets easier

[Q-Tip]
Girl, I heard you're lookin' for some good times
If you Quest from the Soul, guess what we'll find
Whole lotta fun, lots of fun together
Just like kissin' cousins (Yeah, that's kinda clever)
Close like bosoms, bosoms stay close
If you be my Buddy, I will toast
That we're like Ethel Mertz and Lucille McGillicuddy
You can be mine and I can be your Buddy

[Dove]
The best Buddy's in evening wear
Long lovin' lets Tru know (he's in there)
I feel sorry for those who pay a fare (a fee?)
Word to the D
I don't beg, I just tease my Buddy with my right leg (ha-ha)
And then when it's ready what's said
Is Buddy is best in bed (Word to the D)

[Afrika]
Buddy buddy told us all to get into a circle
Said don't bug because I won't hurt you
All I really wanna do is freak you
(You know what? She freaked us)

[Mike G]
And I watched and then I checked my Swatch to see the time
The Tribe had formed a Buddy line
And that Buddy was mine, all mine

[Pos]
Now when Quest, Jungle and De La Soul
Is at the clubs, our ritual unfolds
Grab our bones and start swingin' our hands
(Then Jenny start flockin' in everywhere)
'Cause Jenifa just wants to stay aware
Yo fellas, should we keep her aware?
(Mmm, Hmm...yeah!!!)

[Outro: Samples and dialogue]
J-I-M, B-R-O, W-S-K-I
And the girl was next to me
In order to make his cave girl smile
He had to improve his whistle's style
Here he comes now
Jim Browski
It's very stimulating
Oh the dic-dic-dictionary, is very necessary

Ooh I don't know what to do about this Buddy stuff man
It driving me crazy
Sing French to me baby
Oh my god, what is that in your hand
Wait a minute what are you doing with that
Ay dio mios
Oh my goodness
There's something about these french men out here today
Buddy?
Let me tell you something
You can be my Buddy anytime
