(feat. Fabolous)

[Fabolous:]
Ay shake I told you I got you homie wut sup brutha?
Let's get this done homie this what I do right here baby (haha)
Shorty you the one I give an air to
They can turn the music up if they care to
Pull up right here and shorty right here
Her ass make room even in a tight pair
The truth is I'm on top like a roof is
So they trying to get where my blue tooth is
But I get cocky on the low
And when they holla I get foxy on a hoe
Yeah that mean I go deaf
My game so official it don't need no ref
If you stop winning, I stop winning
Like I'm in a club and the D.J. stop spinnin
Baby I can turn you on
Why them otha niggas tryna learn the song
It's LoSo in case you ain't know so
Can't hear haters they talk low so

[Brutha:]
Unlike anything that I have ever seen
Like a face that been cut out a magazine
And a body like a goddess
Got these dudes trying they hardest
But it ain't working
Ohhhhhhh
I just sit back and observe the way you move
Something about you make me wanna get to you
And then the lights go dim. (Yeah)
And then I get this feeling
Ohhhhhhh

Cause I can't hear the music. (Cause I'm focused on you)
I can't hear the music. (When I'm dancing with you)
I can't hear the music
Feels like it's just me and you, in here, nobody can hear
I can't hear the music. (Cause I'm focused on you)
I can't hear the music. (When I'm dancing with you)
I can't hear the music
Feels like it just me and you, in here, nobody can hear

Unlike anything that I have ever felt before
When we laid eyes, I can see that there was something more
She was sexy and so innocent
Guilty and magnificent
I knew I had to have that girl
There was a silence that fell upon the core
Here comes the spotlight and all I can see was her
We started moving to her heartbeat
You became a part of me (a part of me)

Cause I can't hear the music. (Cause I'm focused on you)
I can't hear the music. (When I'm dancing with you)
I can't hear the music
Feels like it's just me and you, in here, nobody can hear
I can't hear the music. (Cause I'm focused on you)
I can't hear the music. (When I'm dancing with you)
I can't hear the music
Feels like it just me and you, in here, nobody can hear
(Nooooooo)

Your so beautiful like an angel on the dance floor
All eyes are on you your impossible to ignore
Since I laid eyes on you I don't think I'm a need them anymore
Your what I'm listening for

Cause I can't hear the music. (Cause I'm focused on you)
I can't hear the music. (When I'm dancing with you)
I can't hear the music
Feels like it's just me and you, in here, nobody can hear

(Cause I'm focused on you)
(When I'm dancing with you)
Feels like it just me and you, in here, nobody can hear

Ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhh, (I can't hear the music)
Ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhh, (I can't hear the music)
Ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhh, (I can't hear the music)
Ohhhh, ohhh, ohhhhh, (I can't hear the music)
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh
