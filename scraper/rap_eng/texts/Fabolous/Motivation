[Intro]
It's like, what make you do what you do?
What's your motivation?

[Chorus]
Money keep a nigga motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keepin' her motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keep a nigga motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keepin' her motivated
We all need a little motivation

[Verse 1]
Keep all the real niggas motivated
Keep all them lil niggas motivated
Maybach 600, it drove her crazy
Shawty gon' do it, she motivated
I've been neglectin' the Rover lately
I've been neglectin' the sober lately
If I do say like I'm HOVA baby
This paper say "bend it over baby"
Trickin' and treatin', October baby
She call me Mr. October baby
Yeah, Reggie Jackson, the motivator
Young OG Jackson, the motivator
Hope that is worth it, it ain't overrated
You talkin' dues then I overpaid it
Swear that I can't even call 'em haters
What they be doin' is overhatin'
Let 'em know, motivational speaker
Just motivates you through your speakers, know
Lookin down on a nigga, know
Less she checkin' my sneakers, woah
You bet the check that she sneakin', woah
I bet the check that she freaky, woah
Now you askin why I kill ya
Takin' pics in Waikiki

[Chorus]
Money keep a nigga motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keepin' her motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keep a nigga motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keepin' her motivated
We all need a little motivation

[Bridge]
This for the ones who be grindin'
This for the ones who be shinin'
Keep on till you blind 'em
This for the team that's behind 'em
If they don't know then remind
And put trust in the timin'
This for the lady beside him
One he confide in
Keep him on top, let you ride him
This for the OG that got him
This for the right hand who ridin'
They out here not hidin'

[Verse 2]
I came from the dirt but I made it big
Now I can push that Mercedes-Benz
Just had a son, I might baby blue it
Bitch I'm so loco, my navy blue it
Shoutout the ones that were shady to me
That hate from y'all probably made me do it
Knew they was doubt, never catered to it
Love that dough like I'm related to it
Comin' through with the family
They all related to me
Mommy say she love the boy
Like she related to me
Feed her Ros√© 'til she motivated
She from the Lou so she motivated
Pay me to be here, promotervated
Know we gon' ball, let's keep motivated
(Let's get it)

[Chorus]
Money keep a nigga motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keepin' her motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keep a nigga motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keepin' her motivated
We all need a little motivation

[Bridge]
This for the ones who be grindin'
This for the ones who be shinin'
Keep on till you blind 'em
This for the team that's behind 'em
If they don't know then remind
And put trust in the timin'
This for the lady beside him
One he confide in
Keep him on top, let you ride him
This for the OG that got him
This for the right hand who ridin'
They out here not hidin'

[Verse 3]
Crib is so out there, it feel like we hidin'
So many cars I had trouble decidin'
On which one I'm ridin'
But I never had trouble with knowin' who ridin'
'Cause my niggas slidin'
We the base runners who beat out the throw they providin'
And tell the back catcher that we had no problem collidin'
Just to get home safe
Always believed that one day I'd be Big
I had my own Faith
All of my niggas gonna keep ridin' with me
Till they get they own Wraith
I'm they motivation, I'm your motivation
Since Superwoman, a little motivation
A little motivation, clap for a nigga
Dap for a nigga, brrrat for a nigga
Coulda been a wrap for a nigga
Coulda been a trap for a nigga
That's why I run laps for a nigga
Find a way on a map for a nigga
Ain't no app for a nigga
Like for real, you should be happy for a nigga
Motivation... motivation
Like for real you should be happy for a nigga
Motivation, that it even happened for a nigga
Motivation... whoa

[Hook]
Money keep a nigga motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keepin' her motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keep a nigga motivated
We all need a little motivation
Money keepin' her motivated
We all need a little motivation
