You be killing ‘em, Girl you be killin‘ em

She do it with no hands and I be feelin’ that
Then she yellow tape anywhere she chillin’ at
You need tear drops baby, killer tatts
From New York to Cali, back down to Florida
Her shoes made by a foreigner, call the coroner
They should arrest you, at least isssue you a warrant for
They way you be killin’ em Neyo bring the chorus bruh…
