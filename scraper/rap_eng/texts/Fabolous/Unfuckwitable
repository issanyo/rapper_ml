[Chorus: Red Cafe & Fabolous]
All the bitches say, "I'm unfuckwitable"
The real niggas say, "I'm unfuckwitable"
Twenty-four seven, three sixty five
How the game dead when I'm still alive?
Live bitches say, "I'm unfuckwitable"
Real niggas say, "I'm unfuckwitable" (what else?)
Twenty-four seven, three sixty five
How the game dead when I'm still alive?

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Hold up, I'm hotter than a fugitive (yeah)
America's most wanted, that swag lucrative
Unfuckwitable, slanging that mineral
Talking that G talk, living like a general
Ten bottles in the club sound like the minimal
My niggas them killas for real, I'm talking federal
It's fuck you, it's fuck you -- never no subliminal
Stacking ones every day, active criminal
Me and twenty million cash look identical
If you broke and you in the streets, you suckers pitiful
Hoes say they love a nigga after they fuck a nigga
But I ain't looking for love, that's for sucker niggas
Let him be your man, I'll gladly be the other nigga
Cuddle with dog all winter, I'm your summer nigga
Hustle from sunup, hustle til the sun down
Bullshit aside, I'm the realest killer in town
Most the niggas in the streets, they know how I get down
Bad bitch riding shotty when the top let down
Look, as a young boy I used to have hoop dreams
Now I'm like Shaq, I still got hoop dreams

[Chorus: Red Cafe & Fabolous]
All the bitches say, "I'm unfuckwitable"
The real niggas say, "I'm unfuckwitable"
Twenty-four seven, three sixty five
How the game dead when I'm still alive?
Live bitches say, "I'm unfuckwitable"
Real niggas say, "I'm unfuckwitable" (what else?)
Twenty-four seven, three sixty five
How the game dead when I'm still alive?

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I ain't feeling niggas, I ain't that sentimental
I got no words for 'em, let's just keep it instrumental
I put it down where I stay, word to incidentals
And guess who opened the door you niggas entered in through?
Y'all would never measure up using my ruler
You're more soft than a second-year high schooler
My nigga Hov told me finish my breakfast
And now I'm looking at you niggas like breakfast
French toast, turkey bacon
Shit's in bad shape, too many squares circulating
Money talks and y'all voices are unheard
When they ask about us, one word
Unfuckwitable, we be in the town too
That's why them boys call us the not-fucking-around crew
Brooklyn keep on taking it, known to get our Deebo on
When you touch down, bow down -- get your Tebow on
You won't say it in the street, don't say it in your tweets
You won't say it when we meet, don't say it on them beats
Real nigga shit -- RNS
Last night was a movie, starring us

[Chorus: Red Cafe & Fabolous]
All the bitches say, "I'm unfuckwitable"
The real niggas say, "I'm unfuckwitable"
Twenty-four seven, three sixty five
How the game dead when I'm still alive?
Live bitches say, "I'm unfuckwitable"
Real niggas say, "I'm unfuckwitable" (what else?)
Twenty-four seven, three sixty five
How the game dead when I'm still alive?
