[Verse 1 - August Alsina]

They don't ever see you like i do
First thing when you wake up, before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like i do
Cause with me you ain't the same
You ain't gotta run no game
Girl cause what you do and what i do ain't different
We both on a mission, i love your ambition
And i know how it is to hit the block and get the guap
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damn i hope somebody spend some money today
And i pray nobody come and try to take it away
Cause i'm just out here doing what i gotta do
Cause all these fucking bills are due
And i see all this money to make


[Hook - August Alsina]

So girl you know that, I ain't judging you
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Baby, i salute
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Make that money girl its yours, Spend that money girl its yours
You work hard for it, it's yours, Work that body baby its yours
I ain't judging you
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money

[Verse 2: August Alsina]

Single mother in college, working hard for them dollars
Girl we got something in common, making money with ballers
See you pussy popping that onyx, keep it clapping that magic
Got them niggas tricking their phallus
Come on making it happen
Girl i love seeing your back bend
They cashing out And you cash in
They going broke and you working
Back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be, when income is uncertain
Hustling just to make a way, and i know you thinking
Damn i hope Somebody spend some money today
And i pray nobody come and try to take it away
Cause i'm just out here doing what i gotta do
Cause all these fucking bills are due
And i see all this money to make


[Hook: August Alsina]

So girl you know that, I ain't judging you
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Baby, i salute
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Make that money girl its yours, Spend that money girl its yours
You work hard for it, it's yours, Work that body baby its yours
I ain't judging you
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money

[Verse 3: Fabolous]

We grind together, we shine together
Show the single folks how to double
Two wrongs don't make it right
But two strong's make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers
Talking down on the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win
And sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty, stacked up shawty
And if i ever need it, she the back up for me
Blacked up foree, his and hers Mercedes
No hoes to the house, just the first lady
So gone and get your money, don't let nobody stop that
Even if you gotta pop that (Work that body baby its yours)
We do it big, and know together we about to do it bigger
My little mama hustle harder than a lot of these niggas

[Hook: August Alsina]

So girl you know that, I ain't judging you
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Baby, i salute
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Make that money girl its yours, Spend that money girl its yours
You work hard for it, it's yours, Work that body baby its yours
I ain't judging you
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
Gon and get cha money
