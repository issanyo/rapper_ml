[Intro: Fabolous] +{Ne-Yo}
{Oh Oh}
{Whoa-oh}
Yeah

Around somebody's house after this one
They gone Make babies to this
I mean it feels good
Oh yeah the song too

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
I told her I'll be there in a minute
She knew I'mma take it down soon as I get it
You can leave your hair in a mess, don't even get dress
Tonight we makin love
I told her lets stay home, she was with it
She know I'mma take it down soon as I get it
Tonight we're making love making love

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
June 22, think I came in 20 seconds
I was watching honey peck it while she lay on tummy naked
To the pace of the base and this cash money record
She just drop, drop, drop, damn you Manny fresh
But I got my thing together, told her she could bring whateva
Get some green, we could puff get the cream get the cuff
Baby even when I'm gentle, it might seem like its ruff
But if neighbors ain't comlpaining, you ain't screaming enuff
And yeah they might hear as I'm slappin to the jewel
She said baby right there, do it rappid do it smooth
I said baby right where, kept tappin to the groove
She said nigga right there, I'mma slap you if you move

[Hook: Ne-Yo]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Can't forget the feeling when you stairing at the ceiling
And you can't catch your breath you just laying there chilling
Like 1 and then the 2, 2 and then the 3, 3 and then the 4
Damn I want some more
So I slam her to the floor, set the camera to record
Throw them legs up in the air, just like lamborghini doors
See we might have had some problems with the stamina before
I'm no amature I'm sure, I cold ram until you're sore
But I ain't trying to hurt ya
I'm jus trying to nuture
Them nigga just flurt to hit it and to hurt ya
What I'm throwin dity for, I'm trying to alert ya
But Fuck that lay it down, let a nigga work ya

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
Till you tell me that you had enough
I'mma slow it down and I'mma speed it up
And I will not stop
Do it to you like a dude that ain't got no job
I ain't got nowhere to be so I don't gotta leave
Get the itis in the sheets I'mma eat and go to sleep
Then we wake up in the b, everything you do to me
I'mma turn and do to you
And then I'mma black and blue that thing (dance for me)
I love the way you move that thing (so nasty)
I look and say ohh that thing
Make me wanna sing a song (anybody every seen a)
Make em wanna sing along

[Hook]
