[Intro: Jazzy]
Now when I see you get tough
You know where I'm at, come get me
Just sit down lookin' rough
But you have another Coke when you ready

[Verse: Fabolous]
I be drinking, you be drinking till we both be litty
I'm a winner, why wouldn't I have my trophy with me
Nothing's free, gotta charge like the Mophie with me
Everything costs bread, she know that loaf be with me
If I'm sippin' Bobby Brown you know I might go for Whitney
If I'm in a different world I might go for Whitley
Pack the linen suit, I got the loafers with me
Fly to Hawaii, I got Sophie with me
D'usse and lemonade, I call it Jay and Bey
Niggas love watermelon, I'm just sayin' be
I been drinkin', I been drinkin'
Couple times it was like, "Fuck was I thinkin'?"
Hol' up, one time for the catfishes
All them "You don't really look like that" bitches
When I was drunk she looked like Amber Rose
Sobered up she started lookin' like Derrick Rose
I don't worry 'bout that with bae though
I don't worry 'bout that with bae though
Make-up off and she's still pretty
I'm on my way and I'm still litty

[Outro: Jazzy]
Said me and my baby we don't really need to turn up
'Cause we turn up naturally
When we need that action, for that action
It's a good old time indeed
Said me and my baby we don't really need to turn up
'Cause we turn up naturally
When we need that action, for that action
It's a good old time indeed
It's goin' down
