[Verse 1]
Yo, yall gon' hear this in the nightclubs for a year
When the song go on, throw on, ya tight mugs or ya stares
It's like Bugs up in here
Like Thugs up in here
Throw ya fingas up like you gon' snipe slugs in the air
Haters - might have a slight grudge when I'm there
See the strobes on my wrist, light bubbles in my ear
Ladies pass through, I might rub on her rear
Pop Cris' in her face, make her wipe suds from her hair
Even dykes tug on my gear the way I like strut up in here
Don't get the Nike's smudged that I wear
Drinks be flingin, minks be swingin
The way the pinky-ringin, link be blingin, you think we slingin
I wanna see the roof of your coupe, sittin behind ya
18 inches and up, no sittin on minors
After tha club hittin a diner, spittin the lines
And end up in a hotel, gettin vagina

[Hook]
Ladies- Rub ya tits if ya gettin right (Hey)
Niggas- Grab ya dicks if ya gettin right (Ho)
Don't be thinkin bout that nigga that you wit tonite
Don't be thinkin bout that chick that you wit tonite
Ladies- Rub ya tits if ya gettin right (Hey)
Niggas- Grab ya dicks if ya gettin right (Ho)
If gettin right is the only thing you wit tonite
Ladies (Hey)
Niggas (Ho)

[Verse 2]
Ma, it's hard to stop and not admit it
You like the way the drop I got is kitted
Cops can't spot who is it
You wanna stop and jot ya digits
Must be how I hop on yatchs and visit, tropic spots I did it
The top the watch is glitted
Make niggas wanna bop they knots, stop and plot to get it
Like I won't pop a shot in fitteds
I got the type of machine guns that cops and swats prohibit
I wanna drop but not to hit it, stop we not committed
Think we hittin shoppin spots, forget it
Move ya neck, rock from side to side
Neva get checked, me and my Glock side and side
This in ya deck let it knock inside ya ride
We in the 'jects of the blocks in the widest five
Spendin a grands nutin for 'lous (lis)
You ain't got on a badge playa, so why you handcuffin the chicks?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yall hardly see I be 'round
But when I do, I be, I be down in a VIP lounge
I get in the club, I dont need ID now
Bulky knit, can't even see my 3-pound
Yall know how that kid from B-Stuy be down
Yall see my C-pound, yall see yall be drowned
Skee-o, gotta, re-ply she down, which sheet I meet down
I know she gettin right- HEY
Ladies tug me when I strut
So this thug be in the cut, takin bubbly to the gut
Rays beamin, yall think I be day-dreamin
But I stay schemin like, "Shortie could get it"
Next screenin, they see all this ice and grey gleamin
They like "Damn, Shortie could get it"
And I may be crazy
But I see some ladies tonite that should be drinkin my baby's baby
