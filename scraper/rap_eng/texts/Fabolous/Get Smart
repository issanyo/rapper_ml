[Verse 1]
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Asian
Who have the weekend occasion
Sneak in the Days Inn
I'm never tweakin' off hazin', frequently blazin'
Now if they ain't on ya face it ain't the cheeks that I stays in
Can't deny it, used to take weeks of persuasion
Now I just be lookin' down at these freaks in amazement
With a girl, the first thing I peep or notice
Is how full her lips is and deep her throat is
So, you ain't gotta be perfect
I'll buy you whatever you want, but your head's gotta be worth it
Still what I mean is
Your brain gotta send chills through my penis
'Til I feel like a genius
Look at it from a playa's position
I got a scholarship, I get smart without payin' tuition
My classes be like two, three hours
That's why I'm the smartest young guy since Doogie Howser

[Hook]
Still what I mean is
I really just wanna get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades in all of my classes
Still what I mean is
I really just wanna get smart until I feel like a genius
And all that I ask is
That you help me get good grades, Ma in all of my classes

[Verse 2]
These bitches they done got real bad
Cause now I pull out, leave 'em lookin' like models for a "Got milk?" ad
I'm a teacher's pet
And even if you good at math ma
You'll have trouble countin' each baguette
All it takes wit' hood tutors is some good buddha
And promise to buy them some of them Razor foot scooters
They don't care where the cops is
Outta the blue they stop biz
Teacher start givin' me a pop quiz
I stay 10 minutes in night clubs
Pocket full of green, Duke on it that invented the light bulb
I might pass on a female, and call up a substitute just for night
Class in the CL
Ya man don't know why his chicks knees be scared
Can't tell her from givin' my dick CPR
If ya lift up and say ya jaws hurtin', before squirtin'
It's for certain
You are the weakest link, "Goodbye"

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You know my girls in North and South Caddy
They all for mouth waxin'
And the whores in Texas, oral sexes
I head to Cali, take more blows to the head than Ali
And the Philly mamies suck the kid outta Willie Bonnie
And the way females show southern hospitality in ATL
Don't even know them hoes
In South Beach, they let me jimmy dip in they mouthpiece
Forget about Vegas, the head is outrageous
The broads in Seattle will make ya knees rattle
Fa shizzle da snizzle get smizzle down in VA
Them hoes in Detroit will suck the whole Brevoort
My dick don't get to die down when I'm in Chi-Town
My bitches in B-More, blow me 'til they knees sore
Good damn, there face I, ain't screwed out in St. Lou'
New York, it ain't got no pipe instructions
They just suck it outta you like liposuction

[Hook]
