[Refrain]
Wanna be your number one fan
But from the stage
Know it's hard to see way up in the stands
I understand, but damn
I understand, but damn
Wishin' I could be that one man, but you juggle
Way too many of them with one hand
I understand, but damn
I understand, but damn

[Verse 1]
Slow down baby, let me be your yellow light
The way we met is wrong, let me say hello right
You need a yellow light, a break from this ghetto life
The way I roll make the haters want to yell, no dice
She said what matters is that you keep those stilettos nice
And when you slap this ass, it shake like Jello, right
What I like, roll them cigarellos tight
I nick-named her big chicken and yellow rice
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair
And she know they talking but she never gon' care
Cause when you ballin' trash talk is what you gon' hear
I can't imagine what would fall upon LeBron's ear
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line
Niggas buy her watches just for making time
Fakes say "give it up" I never had to ask
Call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch the last plane?
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames
The same dudes will see her and give they last name
Funny how I became the apple of her eye
The game went South and I'm a rapper from NY
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love "Trap or Die"
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy
And fell in love with a 2009 verse
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck
I walked in strong, mentally palming my nuts
I got em swarming and stuck, she calm in the cut
You know me, I can spot a swan from a duck
My approach? Smoother than an Armani tux
The diamonds going off like the alarm on a truck
Small talk, warming her up, palming her cup
She told me I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck
But for now she had to go
The chat just quickly changed
She was chillin', now she leavin'
That was kinda strange
Asked can we meet again
She said that can be arranged
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged
We did, she slid, but that'll be explained
But for now she hopped into a Platinum-colored Range

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Ohhhhhhhhh ohhhhh
Ya see baby
You gotta get ya mind right while there is still time left
You know, life. more than VIP sections and flight confirmations
You jump star to star, got your own constellation
I ain't tryna say, shit, maybe i am…
…never follow your heart
You’re sure to lose your mind if you never follow your heart
You need to slow down (yeah baby, you need to slow down) [x2]
Slow down
You need to slow down
You need to slow, you need to slow, you need to slow down
(you need to slow, you need to slow)
Baby, forreal you need to slow it on down
