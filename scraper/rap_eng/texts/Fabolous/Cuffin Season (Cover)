(Hook)


These slides keep calling

(I ain't picking up x2)

(Told these slides I'll be back around June x2)

Better yet I change my number

For the whole summer

Damn I'm so hot in the fucking summer

These slides keep calling

I ain't picking up

Damn im so hot in the fucking summer

Verse 1


Phone getting

No ring like Lebron did

She got a new daddy

Fresh Air farm kid

Out in Florida

Move faster than Dora

Call Her open milk

Need sun to spoil her

She live in his crib

Even drive his car too

Playing wit his money

While he working hard too

But she in my son inbox

With the same old shit

Thought he been blocked ?

Love you

I miss u

I really wanna kiss u

Had 2 abortions

Now u grabbing the tissue

We don't feel sorry for u

Should call child services on u

U Swallowed a lot of kids

Ya Pussy hole is taco big

Got more bodies

Than the Wayne Perry bid

Give up the jig

Stop playing little bitch fisher price

Love don't cost a thing

But feelings come wit a price

Verse 2


You was in Rucker park all summer

You was at Cool out  Mondays

All summer

Don't forget about Dyckman

Uptown sipping Nemo wit da

Light skins

Ya Instagram so exciting

Ya body so enticing

Yea u got the cake

But no icing

All in a nigga ear

No Tyson

U want me to take you to AC ?

Bitch come to my crib for some AC

Cause we know u don't got none

Ya shared room is a hot one

How got 20 thousand followers

But ya bank account

Don't got 20 dollars

U say I think I'm the shit

Cause I got a car

Bitch save that cheap shot

For the fucking bar
