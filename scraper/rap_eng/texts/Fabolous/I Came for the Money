[Intro]
I heard this nigga be right here man
Up in some bitch crib up here on the third floor
Yeah he come out this building I'm a warm his ass up
This nigga playing with the money man, fuck
This nigga been ducking me all fucking week man

[Verse 1]
I'm waiting on my green like I'm sitting at a red lightIt's been a week nigga better have my bread rightHeard if the head right nigga there every night
So I'm outside in the ride no headlightsGot the semi 9 with the red lightHe goin' give me mine or he dead alright
It's a dead night nobody on the block
In the morning John Doe body on the block
I'm waiting crazy on the day I got the fucking call
This nigga and his bitch shopping in the fucking mallI'm blowing up his phone, pussy nigga ducking calls
Spending my money on the slut who's sucking balls
Heard he in the club popping bottle after bottle
Whatever car he in that's the ride we'll have to follow
Can't wait to walk up pop him hollow after hollowPass me that shit son here this nigga go

[Hook: Repeated]
I came for the money
I ain't here to play with ya'll

[Verse 2]
I caught him walking out the building slow
Quickly I draw the toastYou shoulda saw his face look like he saw a ghost
He kept backing up I'm tryna draw him closeHe saying "chill I know what I got for ya Los"
Give me a lil time a nigga got jammed in jailYou know my fam Jamel look like Sam CassellGot knocked with like 900 grams of scale
On 75 north Alabama saleI don't know the nigga don't give a damn as well
You no negotiator and I ain't SamuelI squeeze 2 then the chamber got jammed with shells
And they say life is a gamble well
Guess today was his lucky day
He gotta move now I know where the fuck he stay
Catch his little chick and fried up Kentucky way
Bet if he flashed that she know where the stash at

[Outro]

That bitch know where that money at man
That's what we going to do, we going to lay on this bitch
This nigga going to come through here, that's it
This nigga playing with the money
