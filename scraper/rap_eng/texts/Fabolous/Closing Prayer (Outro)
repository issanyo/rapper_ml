[DJ Drama]
As we now give our final words
And lay the competition to rest
I just want you all to know
That you're in good hands
There's really no need to mourn
They weren't that good anyway
But I promise you if you leave the streets
In the hands of Fabolous a/k/a Funeral Fab
You will never have to worry about whack product again
And I guarantee
We will continue
To kill, the competition
