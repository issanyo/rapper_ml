[Intro: Pardison Fontaine]
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah
I said now I was in the club boppin' shit we love, yeah
Fuck this sweet shit

[Chorus: Pardison Fontaine]
Look, say where you at?
I'm in the field right now
I had to bust a doggie 'cause shit was getting real right now
If you broke I know how you feel right now
I got a baby on the way, I got bills right now
Where you going for the kilo right now
I'm in the store looking for some shit to steal right now
They think I won't, but I will right now
Face down, ass up, you know the drill right now

[Verse 1: Pardison Fontaine]
I said the cops still wildin'
My stock still risin'
These niggas still frontin'
And these bitches still lyin'
They know that I'm the one
I'm a mouthafuckin' problem
And the only thing I'm scared of's a mothafuckin' siren
Look, summer days was the worst days
We was drinking tap water, we was thirsty
A nigga lookin' for a come up in the worst way
Hungry on Friday and don't get paid till Thursday
They gon' tell you how it is
They say that touchin' bricks is better than touchin' ribs
And now I make it rain in the club, got the hoes getting loose
It used to rain in my crib, I had holes in the roof

[Chorus: Pardison Fontaine]
Where you at?
I'm in the field right now
I had to bust a doggie 'cause shit was getting real right now
If you broke I know how you feel right now
I got a baby on the way, I got bills right now
Where you going for the kilo right now
I'm in the store looking for some shit to steal right now
They think I won't, but I will right now
Face down, ass up, you know the drill right now

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
And tell them strippers
I'm in the field right now
I might bust a milly rock and pay some bills right now
Cause it's hard to spot the fake from the real right now
On the frauding like they balling its some real life Bow Wow challenge shit
I'm tryin' balance shit
Some let these niggas know but move in silence shit
I'm on the islands lit
Smoking wild shit
She twerking while she sucking, that bitch is talented
Jimmy Fallon shit
Imma host for the dough
I'm just sticking to the roots, I need bands for the show
Gotta homie with a drum, Gotta homie with dem keys
Need a Maybach Coupe cause I'm the one who in the seas

[Chorus: Pardison Fontaine]
Where you at?
I'm in the field right now
I had to bust a doggie 'cause shit was getting real right now
If you broke I know how you feel right now
I got a baby on the way, I got bills right now
Where you going for the kilo right now
I'm in the store looking for some shit to steal right now
They think I won't, but I will right now
Face down, ass up, you know the drill right now

[Verse 3: Casanoova 2X]
I'm heading to the field right now
So if you trap in my 'ject I got bills right now
[?] That ain't gon here right now
If you an opp I'm on your block I'm on your heels right now
Ohhh
You know I keep that chopper
And how you [?] in my locker
Like Golden State I added shooters to my roster
I was born some [?] I was moving like a lobster
But shit getting real right now
I couldn't scam I'm on the gram I got a deal right now
Swore I'd give my little brother an appeal right now
Dreamchasing, Like Meek Mill right now

[Chorus: Pardison Fontaine]
Where you at?
I'm in the field right now
I had to bust a doggie 'cause shit was getting real right now
If you broke I know how you feel right now
I got a baby on the way, I got bills right now
Where you going for the kilo right now
I'm in the store looking for some shit to steal right now
They think I won't, but I will right now
Face down, ass up, you know the drill right now
