[Verse 1]
Ay Look
Ain't nothing changed but the leaves on the trees
And ya'll coming short like the sleeves on the tees
The money long here like a weave to your knees
So I don't just stunt man, I'm Evel Knieve
And I don't just front man, I back it up
I'm so cool you might wanna zip your jacket up
I breeze through, bullshit
I seize through
With the snub nose .38, bullets just squeeze through
**Choo**
And he's through, just like autumn
Where niggas slip, they fall
Guess who caught em?
Fuck it, kill 'em all like God sought 'em
Next year, Gucci shoe, yeah I sport 'em
And I would tell you where I bought 'em
But they ain't from here, and they might deport 'em
So fall back like the seats in the back
Niggas late, take the seats in the back, Church

[Verse 2]
And ain't nothing up but the top on the coupe
The pockets are fat man, the guap lookin scoop
Got three little women like the pop singing group
I make my point, the ball drop through the hoop
They on my joint, cause I'm rolling with the paper
Under the wing niggas just fold up like the paper
You go make me put you in a headline
And you're girl go help you come up with a hairline
Her suck game while I'm driving is a fool
She know it's head first like she diving in a pool
Right stroke, left stroke, was a death stroke
Bitch blow a whistle like she got a refs throat, foul
And I'm so flagrant
Aim at the neck when I spread that fragrance
I went chrome like cologne
Smell me, nothing you can tell me, gone
