"Playa"

[Intro: Sample of Playa by Notorious B.I.G.]

[Verse] [Fabolous]
Playa, Playa
First you tell the jeweler to Audemar Piguet ya
Then you tellin' waitresses to Rose her
Bumpin VIP and you meet your first Dreya
In the strip club, ones in the air
Nothin' but attention that they wanna pay ya
Dancers tryna welcome to L.A. ya
Shake it like a polaroid picture, Hey Ya
Let 'em know you ballin', you that nigga playa
And you run the city you the new mayor
Tonight is full of hoes and the flyest playas
Can't forget the jackers and the playa haters
And shady hoes can't wait to be-tray ya
It's hard to tell which one is here to slay ya
Nigga be that pretty redbone layup
Texting to the niggas that are tryna lay her
Lights is coming on and you drunk as sailor
Shawty like where the after-party playa?
You grab her by the hand and tell her I'ma take ya
Shawty rollin' with it she is not a faker
Now you with your wheel like a roller skater
Pullin' out the lot you tell your homies 'Later!'
Stopping at the light corner of La Brea
Niggas ride up on ya like a escalator
Wearing all-black Oakland Raider
Screaming run your shit 'fore they AK ya
Begging for your life hoping they don't spray ya
Shoulda left that balla shit for the Lakers
Yeah

[Verse] [Every Ave]

Playa, Playa
Coming from the hood everybody hate ya
Every single day i was serving playas
Talking to the law they put your name on paper
Where the fuck you get my name i hate these nosie neighbors
All up in my business i pray God can save us
Cause its roaches in my fridge
This how we lived
And you know how I can get if i'm needing paper
If Your in the game Playa, Playa
Do it independent Cause the industry will rape yah
Some shit you never seen can't nobody save ya
Before the money come make sure your niggas straight up
Gotta take care of these kids Playa, Playa
Give a fuck about them hoes I'll see them bitches later
Want a nigga cause im fly as jerome Playa
Young nigga but i hustle like i'm roscoe Playa
When I pull up ask me What up Playa, playa?
In my city, Out my city like a sports Playa
I know they hate that We The Best Playa, Playa
Seen my watch asked what team I Playa, Playa
Nigga it ain't bout a check im'a have to play Ya
Playa, [Playa Repeat]
