Yes
It's Lo-So
J-Man
Israel Aka It's Real

[Fabolous:]
Now You No I Gotta Start With Florence
I Met Her At The Heart Of New Orleans
That Was When The Astin Martin Was Orange
A Body That Could Speed Up A Heart Performance
But She Change Character Like Martin Lawrence
A Real Dr. Jekl, Miss Hyde Chick
Flip Out On Ya Call Her Miss Sidekick
So I Told Israel Don't Make It His Gal
Hope She Just A Friend Better Play Up His Style

[Israel:]
Think About The Time That We First Met I Was So Glad I Found Ya
Had Me In A Spell The First Moment That I Laid Eyes Upon Ya 
What I Would Do To Feel Like That And No The Way To Make You Smile Again 
I Would In A Flash Cause

[Israel:]
You Ain't The One I Knew
Have We Been Introduced
Cuz Clearly Ive Thought And I See The Gemini In You
Its Pushing Me Away From You
But Im So In Love With You
Oh I Just Want My Baby Back
Cuz I Didn't Fall For The Gemini In You

(Nonono)

[Israel:]
How Did We Ever Get Into This Point
Wasn't Really In Our Plans
Think About If Life Had Been A Coin
The Other Side Sooo Different
Your Just Reacting
Whats The Cause
Or Are You So Good To Walk Out The Door
When Im Tryna Make A Truth

[Israel:]
Tell Me Do Really I Deserve To You To Just Treat Me Like Some Other Guy
Thought I Was The One You Wanna Be With
Dont Leave Me To Do This Alone
We Came Way To Far To Quit So
Don't Let This Go. And Im Hurtin Baby Cuz

[Chorus: Israel]
You Ain't The One I Knew
Have We Been Introduced
Cuz Clearly Ive Thought And I See The Gemini In You
Its Pushing Me Away From You
And Im So In Love With You
Oh I Just Want My Baby Back
Cuz I Didn't Fall For The Gemini In You

[Israel:]
Oh My Girl How I Desire For Us To Be So Close And Nothing
Could Break Us Apart Girl Gotta Admit Im Scared When You Change On Me

[Fabolous:]
Now I See What Your Ex Was Talking About
One Minute Ya Muslim Then You Porkin It Out
First You Dont Like Rap Then You Walking It Out
And You No Were I Live Then You Stalking It Out
Woow
Id Be Telling Women Why Be A Vergo
And Act So Gemini
But You No Me A Hommie Is Hip To This
Ill Snap You Out Of It Like A Hypnotist (Los)

[Chorus: Israel]
You Ain't The One I Knew
Have We Been Introduced
Cuz Clearly Ive Thought And I See The Gemini In You
Its Pushing Me Away From You
But Im So In Love With You
Oh I Just Want My Baby Back
Cuz I Didn't Fall For The Gemini In You
