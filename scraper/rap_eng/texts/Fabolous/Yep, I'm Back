Now everybody get your hands up
Now everybody get your hands up

[Verse 1]
More better (more better), more cheddar (more cheddar)
I do the Ros√©, im not a "moet-er"
Challenge me with the bling these niggas know better (what)
The wings are as big as the logo on those sweaters (yes)
Hoes better have a fall back attack
I come through like a funeral all black on black
Couple 6-deuces all back to back
Few flying Spur, all back to back
Need a 04-05 Duncan and them (yes)
When it come to makin O's we like dunkin with them
(Nahh) I ain't talking doughnuts
I'm talking white ones like the Nike low cuts
You couldn't see me if ya stood on ya tippy toes
But you could smell this Cali Kush with the zippy closed (yes)
Damn skippy though, seats is peanut butter
You've never seen a stutter like (street) Fid-Di-Di-Di-Damn

[Hook]
Yup I'm back stuntin, yup I'm back frontin
Yup I'm somebody who made somthin outta nothing
Yup I know ya see something that you're wantin
It's just something about me, ya can't go without me y'all
Said ya can't go without me y'all
Said ya can't go without me y'all
Now everybody get yo hands up
Now everybody get yo hands up

[Verse 2]
More stuntin' more frontin'
How ya getting it homie, show something (ya can't tell)
You can ask about him, he go hard (yes)
With that A-M-E-X negro card (yes)
Last time I was seen in a strip club
Rain, I hurricane Katrina'd the strip club
May I say I made a way
Stay fly till the day I fade away
Hey I pray I stay out of a haters way
Let me play like A.I. just get to the point
Let me hear him say I when he spit to the joint
You gonna hear him spray blah when I get to the joint
And the blind men could see that them niggas with Fab is gon
Come like them dudes came for Tony at the Babylon
Rapid fire, do you know a rapper flyer?
Than L-O-S-O, I guess no

[Hook]
Yup I'm back stuntin, yup I'm back frontin
Yup I'm somebody who made somthin outta nothing
Yup I know ya see something that you're wantin
It's just something about me, ya can't go without me y'all
Said ya can't go without me y'all
Said ya can't go without me y'all
Now everybody get yo hands up
Now everybody get yo hands up

[Verse 3]
More wining, more dining
More slow wining them gangstas throw signs in
I can't help that the chain is so shining
And that the shit on my wrists is just co-signing
They don't search us, they know we got the flamers
Still let us slide through the door like Kramer
I believe in God, but my true religion
Is stuffin big faces down in these true religions
We everywhere you ain't never there
New coupes, shoes shine like patent leather airs
Pushin something we ain't got our names on
Two 0-7's neither one of us is James Bond
We in the V-I-P's with the big names
Fendi aviators with the big frames
The streets is watchin, hood is lookin
Brooklyn's back and look how good I'm lookin

[Hook]
Yup I'm back stuntin, yup I'm back frontin
Yup I'm somebody who made somthin outta nothing
Yup I know ya see something that you're wantin
It's just something about me, ya can't go without me y'all
Said ya can't go without me y'all
Said ya can't go without me y'all
Now everybody get yo hands up
Now everybody get yo hands up
