[Intro]
Y’all niggas better stop playin with me
Y’all know ya ain't bout that life
"SOUL tape"
Niiiccee

[Hook]
I’m calling them out
I got their phone numbers
When that money calling, everything gone on hold

[Fabolous - Verse 1]
I’m having doubts, what they really believe
Starting with these Stefan Urquelle, who really be Steve
Photoshop dont make it better, it really deceive
Long hair don't care, but it really be weave
Lets get back to this real shit
That life, I’m bout
Anytime that I’m out, I keep ballin like there’s no time out
On the kush I’m stoned out
On you haters, I zone out
Y’all opinions don't make me money
So what yall thinkin' don't count
I mean the nerve of these niggas giving me attitude
When I be serving these niggas
You rappers platter food

[Hook]
I’m calling them out
I got their phone numbers
When that money calling, everything gone on hold

[Verse 2]
Saying they overrated is a understatement
Them niggas is broke, look like they under maintanence
They rapping bout mansions, but from they momma’s basement
Swear they in phantoms, but drive a Honda station
Lets get back to this real shit
Stay away from that counterfeit
That fake-it till you make-it life, really dont amount to shit
Talkin never bothers us, sometimes it do bore me
So if ya makin movies, hope it based on a true story
Freck said “nothing worse than a rich hater”
When money call, pick it up and call that bitch later
