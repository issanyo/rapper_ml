[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
Wanna see some action baby
Up close and personal
Cause I've been watching baby
Had to come and let you know
That baby girl you got it
Let me see just what you can do
Turn it up tonight you gon' have me all over you
Bet you didn't know that I like your body

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Watch this..
I'm so on her, I can't get off of her
I mean I be on watch like officer
So I give her hard liquor 'til it soften her
Then I take them tight clothes off of her
She just offered me head, how thoughtful, huh?
I can see myself going back and forth in her
I know, I know, that it's awful, huh
But I in-debt her, I usually would've coffin her
But shorty alive, if I give her a mic
Bet shorty a five, classic bitch

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
Wanna see some action baby
Up close and personal
Cause I've been watching baby
Had to come and let you know
That baby girl you got it
Let me see just what you can do
Turn it up tonight you gon' have me all over you
Bet you didn't know that I like your body

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
Psycho, psycho, fuck with a winner
Red Cafe, ahh, Shakedown
I get paper, everything else irrelevant
Before that girl met the Don, she was celibate
Maybe she keep it 100, maybe she lying
Fuck who she fucking tonight, that thing mine
Boss nigga, gettin it ev'ry day
If I ain't getting blocks of money, I'm getting laid
Trees spark up then the champagne pour
Take her to the dog pound, chop her down, score
I'm a winner, lobster dinner
Sauvignon Blanc, Tokyo, Hong Kong
Worldwide hustler, Red Cafe
Keep her on her does, she doin that ballet, what else?

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
Wanna see some action baby
Up close and personal
Cause I've been watching baby
Had to come and let you know
That baby girl you got it
Let me see just what you can do
Turn it up tonight you gon' have me all over you
Bet you didn't know that I like your body

Wanna see some action baby
Up close and personal
Cause I've been watching baby
Had to come and let you know
That baby girl you got it
Let me see just what you can do
Turn it up tonight you gon' have me all over you
Bet you didn't know that I like your body
