[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Ayo Game, what they do boy

[Chorus: The Game]
All I know is bottles and rockin' J's

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
All I know is how to smash on everybody record and do what I do
And make somebody have to go and get a hearse
Yo, Game I don't really give a fuck if it's your record
And you my brother my nigga look I gotta rhyme fresh
See the way I coming, how I do the game, church
Ask somebody, you gotta know you need to get a nurse
Let me bang em with another killa, then we put a couple bottles on the chiller
Kill em with another verse
Everybody see the way I be going and going
How I do it
Niggas the only way we know it, but then again, yes we do
We knowing how I be banging
And every sheet that I get
All the heat I be packin;
And I show it off
With all this money you know where I'm heading
And I'm gonna get the Jordan's the patent 11 leathers
They really banging all the way down to the [?]
And I get a couple pair with all this money I be getting
And I kill em with the bounce, you see the way a nigga steppin
And we pop bottles and we rock J's, see me reppin
Let me show you way I do it before I hit you with the weapon
Don't be spillin' liquor all over my shit, give me a second
Shiiiit, anyway, see we gotta get it up, fillin bottles up
Let me [?]

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Bitches, I'm gettin money, bottles and rocking chains
Money like I'm LeBron, my whip collection insane
Suicidal thoughts, highway to heaven riding like a boss
Condominium in the clouds, 60g's a month
50 floors, marble walls, pictures of Boston Georgia
Bitches snortin' blow, f-ckin fast and cookin' dope
Sanctify, Bally shoes, Audemars, Franck Muller [?]
My new bitches must menage I'm a G

[Chorus: The Game]
All I know is bottles and rockin' J's

[Verse 3: The Game]
Bottles and rockin' J's
Smokin' and sippin' Spades
Pistol tucked in my Louie
Heated up like I'm Wade
Nigga don't do LeBron's, Kobe up on the weekends
Jordan's Monday through Friday especially when I'm freakin
Them cool grey's, thats Monday
Them Space jams thats Tuesday
That Spike Lee's on Wednesday
23 in my Benz eh
You know I love them 6′s especially on my bitches
13′s and them spandex on Thursday, it's your birthday
And Friday I ain't lying, King Of Diamonds I'm in heaven
Red Bone pussy poppin' on my black and red 11′s
Patent leather when I step in
You know what I'm reppin'

Black number 4′s I ain't get it from the store, Buss know

[Verse 4: Fabolous]
I put footprints in them couches
I put so much in my two step
Put on for my city, I ain't got no choice but to rep
I put straight shots in they hair
Make pretty girls, do the ugly face
And they just my song on
Move back I need dougie space like ay, ay
Then its right back to my muggin' face
Niggas said put the weed out
BBM, you buggin face
We walked in, want somethin', bottles pop like we won some'n
Raise a glass for err'ybody that's done something from nothin'
No grind, no shine, dress code, we pay no mind
Cargo's and J's on, they let sun in, no blinds
All I drink is my shit
Stop playin, Youtube
But tonight we on that Red Berry and Cranberry, Soo Woo

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
And I'm smokin' on that purp
Sippin' on that purp
I came in this bitch with some niggas that will murk
And we ain't bout all that talkin', you a dead man walking
Stomp a nigga ass out, in these number 4 Jordans
Got a scope on the barrell that's a hammer with a camera
Hollow tips nigga, tip a nigga like a dancer
I don't know nothing but bitches and gettin money
Blood gang kill a nigga in public
Young Tunechi
Shoot a nigga ass up then it's Deuces
Head shots that fucking vest is so useless
Yeah, yo chuck, fuck these niggas
You know who Piru?
Killer bees nigga

[Chorus: The Game]
All I know is bottles and rockin' J's
