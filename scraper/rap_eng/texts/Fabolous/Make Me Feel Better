[Ne-Yo and Fabolous intro]
Timbo
Hey, Ne-Yo
Say what? Loso
Hey, hey

[Ne-Yo Chorus]
I'm a movement by myself
But I'm a force when we're together
Mami I'm good all by myself
But baby girl you, you make me better
You make me better
You make me better
You make me better
You make me better
You make me better
You make me better
You make me better
You make me better

[Fabolous verse 1]
You plus me, it equals better math
Ya boy a good look but, she my better half
I'm already bossin', already flossin'
But why have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frostin'? (Yep yep Yep)
You keepin' me on my A game (Wit' wit' wit')
Without havin' the same name (They they they)
They may flame (But but but but)
But shawty, we burn it up
The sag in my swag, pep in my step
Daddy do the Gucci, mami in Giuseppes
Yes it's a G thing, whenever we swing
I'ma need Coretta Scott, if I'm gonna be king

[Chorus]

[Ne-Yo verse 2]
First thing's first, I does what I do
But everything I am, she's my improve
I'm already boss, I'm already fly
But if I'm a star, she is the sky (Ah ah ah)
And when I feel like I'm on top (She she she)
She give me reason to not stop (Eh eh eh eh eh)
And though I'm hot (To to to)
Together we burn it up

[Fabolous verse 3]
The caked up cut, the cleaned up ice
When shawty come around, I clean up nice
Dynamic duo, Batman and Robin
Whoever don't like it, it's that man problem (Eh eh eh)
And when I feel like I'm tired (Ma ma ma)
My baby be takin' me higher (Ah ah ah ah ah)
I'm on fire (But but but)
But shawty we burn it up

[Chorus]

[Ne-Yo bridge]
Beside every great man, you can find a woman like a soldier holdin' Hm down

[Fabolous verse 4]
And she treats me like a don, watches for the hit
Checks where I go, even watches who I'm with
The right when I'm wrong, so I never slip
Show me how to move, that's why I never trip
And baby girl, you so major, they should front page ya (Front page Ya)
God bless the parents who made you (Who made you)
Middle finger anybody who hate the
Way we burn it up

[Chorus]
[Fabolous speaking]
Yeah baby, them lames you playin' with
They gonna put you down
We tryin' to compliment you, you know?
Make it better
Top notch Tim
Nice look Ne-Yo
Livin' good Loso
They ask you how you doin' now, tell 'em better 'den them
Ha ha ha ha ha ha

[Chorus]
