And shawty we all the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up
All the way turnt up

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
We ballin' over here
Tune into the game
Call me Rose Bryant
Call Patron James
We walk up in this jawn thick
Tell em play my song quick
And we gone make a fuckin' movie
Like a porn flick

We on a mission
We the James Bond clique
We gon' kill em till the bars close, Convict
Shawty I was born slick
Short temper long dick
Hit you with this magic stick
After that we gone trick

Wala no leash on my colla'
And if that bitch is molla'
I'm single as a dolla'
Smoke west coast kush
In my boy Impala
Got me in the Carmelo
Fuckin' with that Lala

Niggas say they can't be seen
Ain't nobody lookin' though
Turn the heat up on that beef
Ain't nobody cookin' though
A section full of them bitches
That Yo Gotti Lookin' foe

Yeah that's them 5 stars
They get money drive cars
They got them bangin' bodies
With out the knife scar
They take them shots to the head
And survive y'all... NICE

This the flyest shit you may have heard
We all the way up in this Too Short's favorite word

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]

Hit the spot like a god knowin' hoes and greenery
Watch full of cuts blowin' spinach check the scenery
East side high tryna not to spill my lean on me
Oh shit dope dick bet your woman feign on me

Mic check test 1, 2 blue sing on me
You destined for fame don't you be ashamed
Tune into the game if that's Patron James
Then call me Dwayne Spade
Ain't no body in my lane

Purple Rain True Trees Reggie Kush
She don't do meat call her Veggie Bush
I'm a fall back though I don't ever push
1 head 4 chicks 8 legs Octopus

Nigga you don't know all about that
I'm a Telemundo freakin for the weekend
Eatin' clams mussels lobster
Kitchen bed sofa
Stretchin' like Rosa Acosta partna
You know I'm the coldest
On my North Pole shit
While you on your rockin' South Pole when it's cold shit

Don't ask me for hooks you can't afford my focus
Ya turns up Trigga turnt up
