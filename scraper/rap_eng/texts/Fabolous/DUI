[Intro: Fabolous]
Nice
DUI shit
Nice

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Do you know why I stopped you?
With your fine ass, I was in the cut, you came flying past
Wish the way we met would have been different, yo
But you was doing 55 in a 54, so
So pull over, that ass is too fat
I'd Rodney King that till your ass is blue-black
You you and I, I
We a team, high five
Long time no me, who you been doing?
I get overexcited under your influence
Head in the whip won't blink the eye
Let you swallow, but you really shouldn't drink and drive
Got your body swerving, I'm trying to slow down cause the body curves in
Making me wanna bring it like bottle service
That 'whoop-whoop' got you nervous
C'mon, T

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
You might think I'm crazy, but I'm serious
I think it's best that you know now
That when I'm with you, boy, I get this feeling
And I don't wanna slow down
It's so unusual, the doctor can't prescribe it 'cause I'm loving, oh
It's you
Something beautiful, strapped up behind the wheel, the way you lose control, for you

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
You make me wanna ride, I crash into your love, you got me high, oh baby
Another DUI, your touch is like a drug you got me high
Intoxicated, I got another DUI, a DUI, a DUI, whoa
Another DUI, a DUI, a DUI

[Verse 3: Teyana Taylor]
Every time you pick me up to ride around
My mind goes into danger zone
Only meant to kiss my lips and I don't wanna stop
My body says go, go
What's gotten into me? It's like I grabbed a whole bottle of fantasy
And took it to the head, you got me dizzy
Tell my ex boyfriend I DO'd
Tonight we wanna [?]
Won't let me go, oh no

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Jadakiss]
You make me wanna ride, I crash into your love, you got me high, oh baby
Another DUI, your touch is like a drug you got me high
Intoxicated, I got another DUI, a DUI, a DUI, whoa
Another DUI, a DUI, a DUI
Yeah, I like this, uh, yeah, yo

[Verse 4: Jadakiss]
Yeah, strap up, put your belts on
And you know it's alright, but it felt wrong
Matter of fact, it felt good and it felt warm
Like hot wax on your body when it melts on
I see you into him, what you been doing, huh?
Driving under the influence, like a special vibe that you trying to send to him
But you purposely tryna crash into him
That's what love is, that's what the bug is
That's what the benefits of messing with a thug is
Yeah, even know we above this, I just hope you got full coverage

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
You make me wanna ride, I crash into your love, you got me high, oh baby
Another DUI, your touch is like a drug you got me high
Intoxicated, I got another DUI, a DUI, a DUI, whoa
You make me wanna ride, I crash into your love, you got me high, oh baby
Another DUI, your touch is like a drug you got me high
Intoxicated, I got another DUI, a DUI, a DUI, whoa
