[Chorus]
Its clap on, clap off in this bitch
Don't let make turn off your own switch
You couldn't see in the daytime with a flashlight
I got my cash right so..
I don't see nobody [8x]

[VERSE]
I walk up in the spot and see tonight we have a pack house
We all in the building and its rocking like a crack house
All the sexy women wearing dresses with their backs out
My neck is usually lite up but tonight we have a blackout
Call me Tom Edison cause I'm about to light up
My head is in the cloud
Felt like it just took a flight up
They tryin to slow me down like that sizzurp in them white cups
Clear that Imma bubble like you shoke a fucking sprite up
I don't see nobody but I ain't going blind tho
I don't see nobody stoppin me from mine yo
We the money game
We throw up dollar signs hoe
My gun from out a town and make you change your state of mine hoe

[Chorus]
Its clap on, clap off in this bitch
Dont let make turn off your own switch
You couldn't see in the daytime with a flashlight
I got my cash right so..
I don't see nobody [8x]

[VERSE]
Bottles of Rosae keeps finding its way to my section
And groups of pretty bitches with them light skin complexion
Told her Imma kill it and I use magnum protection
I just slide up in it baby thats lethal injection
I'm about that money
Pussy is what a fool chase
Hoes will have you tied up
Bitch I ain't no shoe lace
Smurkin in my black shades
My bbm cool face but I will fix you niggas
You'll make me get my 2k
I don't see nobody but it ain't my vision
I see I'm what it is and you are what it isnt
Lights out niggas, assume the position
With my eyes close I see there is no competition

[Chorus]
Its clap on, clap off in this bitch
Dont let make turn off your own switch
You couldn't see in the daytime with a flashlight
I got my cash right so..
I don't see nobody [8x]
