I guess I ain't got no reason to mingle 'round
I found a superwoman that can leap from a truck in a single bound
Mommy, I'm tryin' to bling you down
So niggas without shades on can't stare when I bring you 'round
She put her lips on the weed and pull it
Then work her tounge to make me cum faster then a speedin' bullet
Her love is stronger then a locomotive
But only for the F A B O L O U S, sing to me ma
Baby, they can't play you
'Cuz I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your superwoman
They don't make any girls like me, no, no
Take a girl like me to get a guy like you
To understand why boys and girls sing
I'm not your average chick
'Cuz they can't do it like this
I've been sent to save your day
And things won't be the same
Baby, they can't play you
'Cuz I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your superwoman
Boy I told you once before you ain't gotta look up in the sky
'Cuz the girl you need is right before your eyes
Get so sick of all these broads
Ain't got nothin' to stand for
'Cuz with me you won't fall off, no baby, ohh
Baby, they can't play you
'Cuz I'll save you
With my super powers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your superwoman
Everyday, everyday
I love you in every special way
Chicken heads
They can't stay, they can't stay
And now that I'm here, I'm here, I'm here
This superwoman might have saved my day
Them CO's I put and gave some play
Naw I wouldn't even wave that way
I understand why them ugly chicks behave that way
They see the icy 'S' on your chest engraved in gray
Be whipped I might 'cuz usually my tips be tight
The only green I keep from you is kryptonite
The way the blowin' red suit fits ur hips so right
I'd be like, da-da-da-dada-da-da-da-da-da-damn
It's like I'm under your spell
If feelin' you is a crime
They gonna have to put me under the jail
You probably hear the details that I be in everything
From lairs to CL's with my share of females
What, you know I care for you
(Care for me)
And anytime this nigga is there for you
(There for me)
These feelings I only share for you
This makes it a lil' more clear for you, bounce
Baby, they can't play you
(Baby)
'Cuz I'll save you
(Gonna save you)
With my super powers
(That's the power of love)
Boy I'm only human
(Only human)
But I'll be your superwoman
(But I'll be your superwoman)
Everyday, haha
Baby, they can't play you
(Baby)
'Cuz I'll save you
(Gonna save you)
With my super powers
(That's the power of love)
Boy I'm only human
(Only human)
But I'll be your superwoman
(But I'll be your superwoman)
Everyday, haha
Baby, they can't play you
(Baby)
'Cuz I'll save you
(Gonna save you)
With my super powers
(That's the power of love)
Boy I'm only human
(Only human)
But I'll be your superwoman
(But I'll be your superwoman)
Everyday, haha
