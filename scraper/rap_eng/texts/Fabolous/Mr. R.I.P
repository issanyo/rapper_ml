R-R I-I P-P
R-R I-I P-P

[Verse 1:]
Picture the top on a 6 series goin poof
It goes underneath, call it burying the roof
I keep it a hundred, don't worry about the proof
And I stay chipped up, don't worry bout my tooth
Clark Kent flow, I just hurry in the booth
Come out so fly you would think I had a cape on
Fresh Prince J's, I got them grapes on
I keep killing shit till all the yellow tape's gone
I look like money, resemblance so striking
28 for the A-P, no Viking
Used to pedal that shit nigga, no cycling
Had them Dominican connects, I'm so Dyckman (Niiceee!)
Shoutout to Tahiry block
Remember me: Range Rover, canary rocks
Swag from BK, haze from Enrique
Dimelo mama it's Dique, Loso

[Hook: x2]
Not errbody who don't know what it be (What it be)
It's ya boy, Mr. R.I.P. (I.P.)
Yeah, you gotta kill these niggas (niggas)
Dead these bitches (bitches) Funeral nigga (say word)

[Verse 2:]
Ask them hoes about me, They know how I D-O
Make them open wide for them bills like T.O
Mama said till ya find he one, Neo
Keep a hat on ya head, so I'm on my Ne-Yo
Niggas talkin Bentley, but be on they Geo
You see the signs of them lyin', they ain't even Leos
Just came from Cabo, bout to go to Rio
Catch me if you can, Leo Dicaprio
F-A-B-O, I be on them lil' planes
Passport tatted up like Lil' Wayne
You niggas O-T, but I'll be O-C
Out the country with that Bobby Johnson, that O-G
Free blue D, free 102
Horace stickin niggas, ride funeral
Errbody put ya guns up, please (up please)
Now errbody hold the one up, squeeze (braah)

[Hook]
