[Intro: Red Café]
What it be like?
Shakedown
Top flow with it
Ah, Yeah

[Verse 1: Red Café]
I be doing me, making the haters mad
Pop tags everyday, I'mma show my ass
Photogenic swag, get automatic cash
Big wheel in the front, 200 on the dash
We running the streets, tell them niggas "hang it up"
Diamonds on my neck, you see my niggas tatted up
We be in the club, never catch me at the bar
Call a waitress, tell her "bring me the bar"
Couple years back an O.G. gave me the word:
"Stop screwin' byrds, start movin' birds"
So I put it down, now I'm the hottest in the hood
If you're looking for me it ain't hard, I'm in the hood

[Hook x2: Red Café]
I'm the realest (Yeah!)
I'm the realest (Yeah!)
If you're looking for that raw meet the dealer
All these hoes up in here know I'm the realest
It's shakedown, look you're fucking with the winners

[Verse 2: Lloyd Banks]
Banks! Nigga meet me at the top
And every weekend spending frequent like my CD about to drop
On your TV, but still see me on the block
I got that South Jamaica shit with me, Three V's off the lot
Lamborghini screaming hear them bitches pulling up
... riding shotgun, put the strippers in the truck
Rake the fucking mall up, ain't no telling what I spend
Living life, kind of like some shit that I done dreamt
The clock's ticking, I'm on my way
I'm Glock gripping, in case they want my pay
Kush crushing, you can smell it when I pass
Wings on the steering wheel, I'm stellar when I smash

[Hook x2: Red Café]
I'm the realest (Yeah!)
I'm the realest (Yeah!)
If you're looking for that raw meet the dealer
All these hoes up in here know I'm the realest
It's shakedown, look you're fucking with the winners

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Yeah, they abuse it like a motherfucker
Everybody winning, somebody loosing like a motherfucker
Ciroc and pineapple juice is like a motherfucker
On my bullshit, Carlos Boozer like a motherfucker
I pulled up in whatever, does it make difference?
They still jump in the car, them bitches Blake Griffin
Smoking all out, call that shit to the max
Suckers smile in my face, they call me shit to my back
But my team ride out, and your team died out
Heard your boys didn't make it, should've never tried out
Getting money over here, like "recession over where?"
And I heard that money talks, so that's all I over hear

[Hook x2: Red Café]
I'm the realest (Yeah!)
I'm the realest (Yeah!)
If you're looking for that raw meet the dealer
All these hoes up in here know I'm the realest
It's shakedown, look you're fucking with the winners
