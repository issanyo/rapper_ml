[Hook - Fabolous]
A thug changes and love changes
And best friends become strangers, Pachanga
P-P-P-P-P-P-P-Pachanga , P-P-P-P-P-P-Pachanga

[Verse 1]
Yo, everything ain't love love, cause if it is
My definition of love must differ his
I mean every friendship has its differences
But these Young Bucks remind me of Fif' and his
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-leges
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his
He a funny little nigga like Eddie Griffin is
Between smoking and joking then you got to live
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give
You 'posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast
Fifteen years, fifteen years!
And now when we say "what's up" the shit seem weird?
But there's a question I prepared for you
How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?
A thug changes

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
There's a parallel path 'tween friends and enemies
And whenever you cross it you make frenemies
There's no remedies for these sick memories
My doctor said there's no cure for the Emilys
Had a crush on you, now we Kim and Cease
We don't even talk no more, it's no biggie
I was so Biggie, you was Faith
I let you slide in my home, you was safe
I thought my ability to provide you stability
Was what was really G--okay, silly me
I was Billy Dee, smooth cat but really street
Really she attract niggas like the "A Milli" beat
And I happen to rap but something about this beat strange
Soon as I try to flow with it, the beat change
Never thought she change
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change
Love changes

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
See when the love is gone then it's just B.S. left
Just niggas with chains on trying to be S.F
That's when your ace boom coom ya B.F.F
Who Pachang ya like they was a P.F. chef
D-D-D-Danger, it just feels Mystikal
I miss the cool nights sittin' in the Carlo
Now it's like "boooo"--we sitting in Apollo
It used to be all good, then shit just went malo
And that's bad--matter of fact, that's sad
Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss
They do some bitch shit, gotta give your a man a divorce
End up watching friends like Joey, Chandler and Ross
Ya see, most of these niggas ain't never love 'em
And these bitches just think whatever of 'em
So maybe playing dumb was kinda clever of 'em
Unless friends are your best friends become strangers
