[INTRO]
IT'S JETSON... LET'S ROCK IT!!
TAHIR I GOT YOU...
UH HAAA... UH HAAA... UH HAAA... YA KNOW
YOU KNOW I DOOSE IT... YOU KNOW I DOOSE IT
CHUM ON... CHUM ON...
HOUSTON WE GOT A PROBLEM...

[VERSE 1: L. ROY JETSON]

CALL NASA, I THINK I NEED A NEW WATCH
SPACE FACE AND A BAND FULL OF MOON ROCKS
ALL THAT STUNTIN' THAT YOU FAKE NIGGAS DO, STOP
YOU JUST RATCHET, YOU BELONG IN A TOOL BOX
ASTEROID BELT, ROCKIN' IT ON A REGULAR
AND THE BIRTHSTONES, LOOKIN' LIKE I'M A NEBULA
SATELLITE PICS VIA DEEP SPACE NINE
CAUSE I'M A BEASTIE BOY ON INTERGALACTIC TIME
WATCH ME?! NAH WATCH YA MISSES
LEAVE 'EM STAR STRUCK, PAPARAZZI YA VISION
SINCE WOMEN ARE FROM VENUS, I'MMA MAKE IT MY MISSION
TO LAND ON HER SURFACE, MISSIONARY POSITION
ROCK STAR STATUS, JUST TO CHECK THE CLARITY
YOU WOULD NEED THE HUBBLE SPACE SCOPE AND SOME THERAPY
LEAVE 'EM G SHOCKED, YOU SHOULD'VE TIMED IT CAREFULLY
YOU MUST BE RABBIT IF YOU THINKING THESE ARE CARROT SEEDS

[Chorus: FABOLOUS (SAMPLED)]

CAME BACK WITH SOME SICKER STONES
I GOT THESE-
CAME BACK WITH SOME SICKER STONES
I GOT THESE-
CAME BACK WITH SOME SICKER STONES
I GOT THESE BROKE NIGGAS LOOKING AT ME LIKE THEY CHOKING ON A CHICKEN
CAME BACK WITH SOME
CAME CAME BACK WITH SOME SICKER
CAME BACK WITH SOME
CAME CAME BACK WITH SOME SICKER
CAME CAME BACK WITH SOME SICKER STONES
I GOT THESE BROKE NIGGAS LOOKING AT ME LIKE I'M CHOKING ON A CHICKEN BONE


[INTRO 2]
VERSE 2 LET ME SHOW EM HOW I DO IT

[VERSE 2: L. ROY JETSON]

POW... HAVING NIGGAS AFRAID
LET'S TAKE IT TO THE JEWELER JUST TO HAVE IT APPRAISED
YOU CAN CHECK THE HUE THE SUN IS SHINING IT'S RAYS
BEAUTY SHOP ROCKS, YOU AND GET IT FROM KAY'S
GLAZE, THEM SHITS DON'T EVEN CUT GLASS
LAWNMOWER MEN ALL YOU DO IS CUT GRASS
QUIT ALL THAT JACKIN' THAT YOU DOING YOU DON'T TOUCH CASH
WEARING THEM CUBES, ILL END UP WITH A ROUGH RASH
FUCK THAT, I'MMA KEEP IT EXQUISITE
I LIKE TO WEAR ICE YOU ONLY SEE IN EXHIBITS
I'M A REAL NIGGA THIS IS WHERE IT'S A DIFFERENCE
YOU FAKE IT TIL YOU MAKE IT CUBICS IS ON A CLEARANCE
AUTHENTIC, SHINY YOU ROCKING DIM CLONES
YOU AIN'T BALLIN' NIGGA STOP QUOTING JIM JONES
