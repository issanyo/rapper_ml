[Hook]
They wan' do whatever I wan' do
I got the 40 cal and my nigga got one too
They wan' do whatever I wan' do
I got the 12 gauge and my nigga got one too
They wan' do whatever I wan' do
I got the MAC 11 and my nigga got one too
They wan' do whatever I wan' do
So go 'head and fuck around we me if they want to

[Verse]
I hear the rumors, but niggas won't say they said it
They know Duke got a shooter like J.J. Reddick
You'd think niggas was G4s the way they jetted
'Cause when they AK's wet it, then your Pelle shredded
They sick, I got the chick that some say they sweated
But cryin' over chicks is the shit that got AJ deaded
Plus, I wipe my ass wit the pay they netted
Couple scams, couple grams, that's the way they get it
But me, wasn't for rap I'm probably down South
With the coke that give the fiends the Bobby Brown mouth
Strung like Whitney, I brung like 50
It's toxic, shit'll have em' sprung like Britney
Now nigga, you think I'm lettin' a young'n get me?
Without gettin' chest shots losin' a lung an' kidney?
I'm trey pound revolvin', butterfly carvin'
Starvin' to get my jab Antonio Tarvin
Anyone botherin' anything I'm involved in
It's Gs on they head like the helmet Brett Favre in
Got a girl I put the X on like she Malcolm
The outcome, she get to suckin' like she a vacuum
But when it wear off, she could pull a Pam Grier off
Give her a couple hours she'll knock the whole sway off
Them niggas got fired, I just took a year off
I really just was tired of niggas talkin' my ear off
I heard it all before like Sunshine Anderson
The flow'll have niggas that's unsigned panickin'
I might turn ya' back to a punchline fan again
It's crazy how many niggas that one line can offend
(Yo they think you talkin 'bout 'em Fab)
But I don't give a flyin' fuck
Bet I got that iron tucked when I'm in that Cayenne truck
I'm like crappin' out when it come to tryin' luck
I like ya ace to the dukes when you placed in the booth
Another bishop, who wanna taste of the juice?
But you gonna end up fallin' on ya face from the roof
I'm waitin' to get the call that Mase on the loose
Next time you see 'em, he'll have his face in a noose
I'm in the club snub on the waist by the boost
Just a taste of the juice just ta' chase wit' the goose
I need a mami who want her face introduced
To the man behind the zipper, and then I flip her
You could ask the strippers, I'm a very good tipper
I'm paid like a playa but move just like a skipper
I gettin' older, growin' wiser
I been shinin' since 3 fingers and high-risers
I tell the model chicks meet a nigga at the Plaza
And then I beat it up somethin' like a womanizer
Without a doubt they walkin' out like Kaiser
And you can try me when I'm comin' out but I advise ya mothafucka
