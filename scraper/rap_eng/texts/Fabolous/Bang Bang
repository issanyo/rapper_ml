Yo if niggas don't know nothin
They know not to try me though
Yeah I like pussy, just not standing by me though
My man did 15, he came home grimey though
Hold his gun eh'day, still think he in '94
We missed him, but we caught up with his slimey ho
Shooters ain't picky so it's Inny Minny Miney Moe
Catch a nigga by his toe
We don't play no games
But it sound like Call Of Duty when we let that P90 go

It's not a pretty thing so it might get ugly
It could get knifey, it might get slugly
I send the family at em I might get Pugsly
Might get Wednesday, Gomez, Cousin It
We on some can't find em, we run up on ya cousin shit
Always sayin what they does and knowin who they wasn't wit
All we tryna do is make the pieces to the puzzle fit
So we question niggas wit the gun out
The story changes, the excuses never run out
It's Summertime so we gonna make sure the heats felt
See me reach hear the clip, don't think it's a seatbelt
Think of 9mm think of .45's
I get away wit a bitch, I must let shorty drive
I tell her keep it running, honk if them people coming
I bought her a Louis bag, it's just to keep the gun in

Stand back click clack, watch me do my thang
