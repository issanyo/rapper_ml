[Intro]
Keep the change my nigga, (nigga bigga than that baby) it's too late for that
Shit changed my nigga, (smack a nigga bigger than that baby)
I know you hate me now
(Ya feel me?) Keep the change my nigga, it's too rich for that
Shit changed my nigga...yea

[Hook]
My nigga please
You ain't cockin no guns like these
My nigga please
You ain't rockin no 1's like these
My nigga please
You ain't gettin no chicks like these
My nigga please, (yea)
You ain't gettin no bricks like these

[Fabolous]
You ain't go from the CL to the CLS, (naw)
Just to get it detailed on Sprewell's best. (naw man)
When they spin it get windy like BLS
And it's early so I know it's gonna retail less
But when I hop out, a nigga gon be well dressed
Things pokin' out the shirt like a female breast
And yea, I may reek of the sour
But I'm so clean it's like I spent a week in the shower
Blind niggas, just wanna peak at my power
Till he say my name I ain't gonna speak of the coward
But when Loso be there, the fofo be near
My ho toe be in a Manolo B pair
Y'all don't come around unless the popo be there
Then this little bird like "Koko be where?", (damn)
And your label want me for your next look
They see the way my neck look, go get your cheque book

[Hook]
My niigga please
You ain't cockin no guns like these. (yea!)
My nigga please
You ain't rockin no 1's like these
My nigga please
You ain't gettin no chicks like these
My nigga please
You ain't gettin no bricks like these

[Fabolous]
White and golden on him, stop from afar
Take the top of the car, and fold it on 'em
Nigga please don't trouble yourselves
The engine in the coupe is a W12
The tunes gon' knock from the subs and the 12's
I usually crawl up to the clubatlike12
I walk in, women start rubbin theyselves
And the bartenders start bringin' bub and the belve. (woooo!)
I'm always seen in EV Jeans
Dark shades on and the vv's clean
I ain't into pullin guns on the TV screen
I pull when it's need to, I'm pullin a weed too
Starvin ass niggas there's bullets to feed you
The hollow tip diet, c'mon and try it
Now picture niggas coming at the family
You have a better chance of it snowin' in Miami

[Hook]
My nigga please
You ain't cockin no guns like these
My nigga please
You ain't rockin no 1's like these
My nigga please
You ain't gettin no chicks like these
My nigga please
You ain't gettin no bricks like these

[Outro]
I'm 'bout to get the t-shirts printed up man, y'all niggas need that
Y'all holla at me man...my "nigga please" shirts
The girls, I makin' the girls ones too
I want the girls to tell these niggas that too
Soon as they try to holla ma you just say..."my nigga please"
Hahaha...
