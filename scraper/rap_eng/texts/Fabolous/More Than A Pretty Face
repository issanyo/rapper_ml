Street family

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Not any girl I be involved with
Uh-uh
Don't necessarily have to be in all of it
Uh-uh
I don't really feel like being balled up
Uh-uh
Until I find a girl who could know what the problems be
And solve it (yeah)
I need to holla at somebody who real (uh)
Not some hottie in heels (oh)
Chasing somebody with mills (oh)
I want somebody with skill (oh)
Somebody who will (oh)
Put the pump shotty and will
Till she had to (bad)
Could be the dollar's bad two
With some loving there
Stick it in the bath, flew (ooh)
But I done
Been around the world (oh)
Still ain't found a girl (oh)
Most woulda given up hope
But nope
It's hard to turn it down (uh-uh)
They say the best way to find a new one
In the haystack is to burn it down
So if you got a pretty face
Let it be shown (woo)
But don't forget to let it be known that (woo)

[Chorus: Farrah]
See, I'm more than a pretty face
I got game, I got brains
I'm not here tryna make my way
And I just need someone who'll...

[Verse 2: Farrah]
I'm just
Tryna get some understanding, yeah
Looking for someone who understands me, yeah
Who knows I'm on the block
Tryna get mine
I'm just tryna make a dolla outta 25 cents
He gotta know
See, it don't matter wherever I go
It's about us, and baby
That's for sure
So he can sit back and be comfortable
While I get this on

[Chorus: Farrah]
See, I'm more than a pretty face
I got game, I got brains (I got game, I got brains, nothing changed)
I'm not here tryna make my way (oh)
And I just need someone who'll (someone who'll follow)
Support, so I follow my dreams (follow my dreams)
If he loves me (loving me)
Every day (every day)
And says to himself that she got game (she got game)
And he's never threatened by me (threatened by me)
'Cause he know she's (got game)
Got game, baby

[Verse 3: Farrah]
I'm not
I'm not impressed with the celebrities
Just want somebody who is good to me
Who knows just what I need
He gives me space, I breathe
That man won't ever leave (won't go)
See, it don't matter wherever I go
For him, I'm representing
That's for sure
Within himself, he must be
Comfortable
And let me get this on

[Chorus: Farrah]
See, I'm more than a pretty face
I got game, I got brains (I got game, got brains, nothing changed)
I'm not here tryna make my way
And I just need someone who'll
Support, so I follow my dreams (follow my dreams)
If he loves me (love me)
Every day (every day)
And says to himself that she got game
And he's never threatened by me
'Cause he know she's
Got game, baby
