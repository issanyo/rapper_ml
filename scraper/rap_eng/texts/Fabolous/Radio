[Intro: Fabolous]
You had me stuck off the realness, fearless
The head was sick, I call that mental illness
Maybe I'm crazy, singing to myself
Looking in the mirror, pointing fingers at myself
Here was you, living off me
Smoking loud, speaking softly
Now I'm in the car, singing off-key like:
"I'm just saying you can do better"
I'm heated, I can't say that I'm chilling
Ain't feeling what you say if you won't say what you're feeling now
Take the words back and think them through
The songs on the radio might be about you

[Verse 1: Cassie]
Why am I thinking of you after all you've done
Why's my heart fighting for you when my mind wants you gone
Held on for too long, oh, oh, oh
I've heard it before, I'm singing the same old story now

When I used to hear from SWV and En Vogue
Mary J. Blige all wrote a song about you
It seems that you're old news, and now I wrote one too
I should have learned about guys like you...

[Chorus]
On the radio
When the DJ used to play what I thought was my favorite song
Who knew that they were trying to tell me about you
And the crazy things you do
How could you be so cruel
And now I wrote a song that's on the radio
And I'm sure that this will someone's favorite song
I hope she knows I'm trying to tell her about you
And the crazy things you do
I know you we don't seem that crude
But you can learn from the songs on the radio

[Verse 2: Cassie]
Now I'm sitting here listening to all those old songs
Crazy they're talking about you and I just sing along
How did I go wrong, oh, oh, oh
They gave me the sign but I didn't listen to 'em no

I used to hear songs from TLC and Destiny's Child too
Xscape and Total had a couple songs about you
Seems that you're old news, now I wrote one too
I should have learned from all the songs...

[Chorus]
On the radio
When the DJ used to play what I thought was my favorite song
Who knew that they were trying to tell me about you
And the crazy things you do
How could you be so cruel
And now I wrote a song that's on the radio
And I'm sure that this will someone's favorite song
I hope she knows I'm trying to tell her about you
And the crazy things you do
I know you we don't seem that crude
But you can learn from the songs on the radio

[Bridge]
I call the request line to ask the DJ how soon would be the next time
That I can expect you to play what I like
The song of my life, at least for tonight
I wanna hear it...

[Chorus]
On the radio
When the DJ used to play what I thought was my favorite song
Who knew that they were trying to tell me about you
And the crazy things you do
How could you be so cruel
And now I wrote a song that's on the radio
