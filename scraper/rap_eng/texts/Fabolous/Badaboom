[Intro - Marques Houston] + (Fabolous)
Yea, yea, yea
(It's B2K) It's B2K ya'll
Welcome ladies and gentlemen (Uh-huh, uh)
Yes, to the You Got Served Soundtrack (Street Family)
Yea, we about to do this
You know how we get down
Oh Yea, you know dat
Come on, Omarion hit 'em wit it

[Verse 1 - Omarion]
Like whoa, you know
Girl you're the star of my show
In this club, poppin bub
The way you shakin deservin some dubs
Turn around, make it bounce
Shake it like you come from out of town
What's yo name, what's yo sign
Girl you leavin with me tonight

[Hook - B2K]
Mami shake it like you care for me
You know I like it when you do that little dance for me
Mami I'm just tryna get you in my room
And see that big bada-bing go bada-boom
Mami shake it like you care for me
You know I like it when you do that little dance for me
Mami I'm just tryna get you in my room
And see that big bada-bing go bada-boom

[Verse 2 - Omarion]
This one, I seen
Couldn't believe the ass in them jeans
To myself, had to think
Any room for me up in them jeans
Ghetto star, you are
Eat you up like a chocolate bar
What's yo name, what's yo sign?
Damn you got me weeping inside

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
I wanna see ya bada-bing go bada-boom
And my house got a wing, with a lotta rooms
I can do a lotta things, get you hot as June
I wanna watch ya body swing, to the hottest grooves
I'm tryna slide behind it, when you throw it 'round
So I can ride and grind it, when you slow it down
Bring it from the top, then take it to the bottom
I'm clingin to ya top, tryna make it to ya oh
The way you move is fab-o-losa
It makes me wanna grab you closa
You know I like it when ya (Bounce! Bounce!)
Throw ya hands up and ya (Bounce! Bounce!)
I don't back down, when I'm pressin ya
I'm finna "Lay the smack down" like the wrestler
But nobody get it to poppin like this man can
Have them girls, get it to poppin on a handstand, ghetto

[Hook x2.5]
