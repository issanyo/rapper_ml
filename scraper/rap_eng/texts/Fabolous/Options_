[Intro: PnB Rock]
Hitmaka!
Yeah
Oh, yeah
Yeah
Ooh
Sound!

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ball, drip, [?], drip, yeah
Ball, 40 got a dick, yeah
Ball, pull up with a stick, yeah
You don't want it, yeah, yeah
Making my way downtown
I got options
Pulling up on you, right now
But I got options
Is you fucking right now? 'Cause I got options
You ain't gotta lie now
'Cause I got options

[Verse 1: Fabolous & PnB Rock]
You move right or get left, only option
If you ain't with the gang, you the opps then
On sight any place we see the opps in
Get popped or get dropped, I got options
