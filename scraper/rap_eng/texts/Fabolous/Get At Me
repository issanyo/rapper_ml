[Intro: Farrah and Method Man]
(Farrah)
Hola papi...

(Method Man)
What? What?
Come on, come on...
What the deal now?
Method Man
Hey yo, Farrah
Baby, come on...

(Farrah)
I've got something for you
You want it?

(Method Man)
Yeah!

(Farrah)
Get at me...

[Method Man]
Show them what? Show that you...

[Verse 1: Method Man]
You's a big girl now
No more daddy's little girl
Ass like wow
You walking at that blad
No more of a lady
Like a livin'-well lady
You traded them big tails
For high heels and did nails, ha
Look at that pose, you's a cover girl and it shows
Look at them tough, how many chicks can fuck with those?
So watch the pose
If I come with these clothes
If I take it too slow
I might lose out on my soul sister

[Chorus: Farrah]
Get at me, get at me
We could be a possibility
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me
Get at me, get at me
We could be a possibility (possibility)
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me

[Verse 2: Farrah]
You are so persistent, man
Insistin' that you (you)
And I could work together, be forever, you (you)
Think I'm the type that need some thug
In my life
And it can't be wrong
'Cause it feels so right

[Chorus: Farrah]
Get at me, get at me
We could be a possibility (yeah, yeah)
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything (I'll be)
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me
Get at me, get at me
We could be a possibility (possibility)
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me

[Verse 3: Farrah]
I can get you twisted, so addicted
And I'm willing to gamble
You can't you handle me and
I could be your Bonnie and you, my Clyde
Let's ride at night
Just get at me and you will see
It could be alright

[Bridge: Farrah]
Boy, you got me feelin' so good
Wanna make sure that I'm understood
Day and night appear when you need
Let me be your fantasy (come on, fantasy)
Boy, you got me feelin' so good
Wanna make sure that I'm understood
Day and night appear when you need
G.E.T A.T M.E (get at me)

[Chorus: Farrah]
Get at me, get at me (oh oh oh)
We could be a possibility (a possibility)
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything (everything)
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me
Get at me, get at me (yeah, come on)
We could be a possibility
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me

[Rap: Method Man]
I'm not a 'That chick, job me!' raper
I'm naughty, but girl that ain't my nature
Johnny Cash all about this paper
You playin' with them big boys now, we rate it all
There's no place for what chap, seventeen - not allowed
Without parents and it's apparent that you belong
With a full grown man, with a mind just as strong, ha (for real)
So here's your chance to advance
Get in your stance and we gon' set it off like true romance
That's my word

[Chorus: Farrah]
Get at me, get at me
We could be a possibility (possibility)
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me (holla if you wanna get at me, get at me)
Get at me, get at me
We could be a possibility (could be a possibility)
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything (I'll be your everything)
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me (yeah, yeah)

[Breakdown: Farrah]
Get at me, get at me (uh huh, uh huh)
We could be a possibility (uh huh, uh huh)
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me
Get at me, get at me (uh huh, uh huh)
We could be a possibility (possibility)
(I'll be your everything, yeah yeah)
Holla if you wanna get at me, get at me
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything
Holla if you wanna get at me
Get at me, get at me
A possibility
Baby, we were meant to be
I'll be your everything
Holla if you wanna get at me
Possibility
Holla if you wanna
Get at me
