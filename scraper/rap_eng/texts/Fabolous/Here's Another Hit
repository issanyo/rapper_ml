[Intro]
And you know the flow is on steroids this year right?
It's Loso just in case you ain't know so
I'm feelin like Arnold in the 70's in here y'know?
Real icy, Call me Arnold Froze-a-nigga or some'n
Yeah... I mean your wife like c'mon, life goes on
Steppin in the spot with that rich young on
Somethin crazy on my arm, yeah, yeah
We're so out of here baby, yo, let's go

[Verse 1]
They say New York's got a problem, I'm their solution
I'm the breath of freshness through this air pollution
Dog you the smog that clogged up the city
I jog through ya fog, dog I'm the Diddy
Of this rap marathon, I'm lyrically in great shape
My late tapes are like how to lose weight tapes
The worst entertainers use me like a personal trainer
They try to use my verses as gainer
But these lightweight rappers, don't know what they up against
I put they pockets on a weight loss supplement
You're powder sniffing if you can't see our difference
It's like dumbbell curls compared to powerlifting
The way I pull up in whips
It looks better than the pullups and dips
I'm being done by the bartenders
I mean maybe it's my star spending
But better get her to that car window
And shorty said her name was Carlinda
That's cool, now won't you get up in this car Linda
Later I could bend you like a car fender
Have that ass waking up tomorrow tender
The Perfect Pushup, it make ya pecs swell
I light the purple kush up, and then I exhale
You gotta breathe, one and then the two
I do a couple laps and be running it in 2
I'm nutritious, I ain't in GNC
Try the new dishes on the truck from GMC
He emcee, he ain't got to do no dancing
These diamonds are just so performance enhancing
I'm princess cut up, canaried them stones
And I'm well known for how I bury 'em home
I just do my thing, and then I carry 'em home
I mean the world don't need another Marion Jones you heard?
Crying, lying that she never did it
Some women are Clemons, they just keep going with it
Don't sweat it, be like Pettite, just admit it
And for the record they be saying Barry Bonds hit it
Get it? We outta here baby
Loso is so outta here baby
Street Fam is so outta here baby
And here's another hit Barry Bonds
Uhh, uh-huh ohh
