[Intro: Mysonne]
This ain't no remix
This a real nigga reunion, ha ha

[Verse 1: Mysonne]
This is for the city, New York, I got you
They ask me why I'm goin so hard, I said I have to
Cause they forgot I'm official and I can rap too
Now I gotta carry this torch like the statue
I'ma bring it back to when rappin' was factual
And if you was a rat, it was a wrap if they catch you
Niggas didn't @ you, they get at you
When loyalty was more than your tattoo
Y'all remember that too, just watch
I'ma bring the Grammy back to Big Pun block
Lick one shot for Trayvon and Ramarley
To all the moms who lost they kids, I'm sorry
Watched Eric Garner get choked, that shit scarred me
Now I'm on it like a young Marcus Garvey
Mami tried to slob me, told her don't even bother
If pussy the only thing you got to offer
These niggas softer than Ms. Parker
I'm on it like 'Pac, he's just a lil' darker
Death before dishonour, that's how I was taught it
Real niggas do real things, that's how we on it

[Chorus: Mysonne]
That's how we, that's how we on it
That's how we, that's how we on it
That's how we, that's how we on it
Walk up in the spot like we own it
That's how we on it

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Tell me what you know about obsession dope
Boy George, Bob Lymon, stretchin' coke
The TEC on me like I stuck my hand in ice water
I'm tryin' put a bullet where the knife caught him
This for my niggas in the yard on they 10th set
Thinkin 'bout they son or they daughter while they bench press
Know a couple real rights, understand you can get left
My hairline would've receded if I had been stressed
Never cuffin', shorty buggin', this bitch an insect
I ran the trap so long I'm just gettin' my wind back
Mys told me this how we on it, my city been back
Tryin to fit it all in them baggies, the fuck you been at?
I never see you, quite clear you very see through
VVS's on my finger, I need at least two
Duckin' indictments, blowin' money, I feel like Meech do
Number one rule on the streets, watch who you speak to

[Chorus: Mysonne]
That's how we, that's how we on it
That's how we, that's how we on it
That's how we, that's how we on it
Walk up in the spot like we own it
That's how we on it

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Young OG, look
You gotta pull up on us and see how we really on it
From nothin' to my name to a check with a milli on it
Had nothin' to show, but now we can really flaunt it
For all the Christmases I ain't get what I really wanted
Now I sit up in a new toy, light up the tree
'member Santa skipped us and went right up the street
Nigga, that's why we on it like that, blame the struggle
Hands full, threw more at me, I had to juggle
Told her I'm from Brooklyn, shorty I gotta thug you
That just mean I'ma grab yo' ass when I hug you
That just mean if I don't know you, I'ma mug you
And if I can't get no money with you I'ma dub you (fuck 'em)
That's how we on it my nigga
Ghost in the garage like the house haunted my nigga
Got the fifth, got the nine, how you want it my nigga?
It could go either way I'm double jointed my nigga
You let me know

[Verse 4: Raekwon]
From the P's with the (?) on the jeans
HD rocks on us, clean, sittin' in the Beamer
Graveyard flow, livin' lean
So many teams, get you whacked for some greens
Stay in green cream, the lake house is mean
With steak, shrimp steam, I copped it out in Queens
(?) or Celine's, my visual game mean
Now Rae to the blings, thanks to rollin' with kings with wings
God bless Carter, restin' in a powerful spot, now you a martyr
My darts got darker, sword named Arthur
The carpenter, stay under cars
And creep up then blow flames through your partner
Look you up and down then I park ya
Just like the Joker when he deaded Batman father
I roll with a ark of deadly poisonous barkers
All rock (?) to light up the spot then chalk ya, we the real
The captain with tamil on the wheel, we the real
Then pop up for a bill and chill, be for real
Be for real, nigga, be for real, nigga

[Chorus: Mysonne]
That's how we, that's how we on it
That's how we, that's how we on it
That's how we, that's how we on it
Walk up in the spot like we own it
That's how we on it
