[Verse 1: Jarrell]
Gtwinz
As you can see, there is no competition
So let me breathe, we're killin the game so listen
Gtwinz is on a come up, we ...
So if you wanna run up, our lyrics will make you bleed
We're putting our own twist up on this track
Sorry Fabolous we've changed it up so don't get mad
MyLife1977 we got your request, so right
And we love our fans because they be treating us so nice
This instrumental is making my pencil press down
Now really gentle because my mental are wild
It's everywhere it's not supposed to be
But when I express they seem to understand me
We coming up with something different, the clock is ticking so fast
Justin tell me why your chick is so bad
Take a picture while you got your chance
Cause the picture is about the only thing that will last, Gtwinz

[Verse 2: Justin]
Uh
Hands down its obvious that God blessed her
Cause I can't find nothing on her that God messed up
With her stood out features, every time I see her
I start thinking like another Killer Mike with some Adidas
And you can tell she paid for everything she got
And she's even got my Terminator vision locked-on
I wanna put it down on her like Jeremiah
And unleash my hidden dragon all up in her crouching tiger
She walking like a model when she leave the grocery store
While cars give unnecessary beeps like it's the Maury show
Just pulling out their camera phones and taking snap shots
Then Bluetooth the pics they took to record to their laptop
Acting like the Black Ops, following her scent
You can tell that she a pimp, that ain't walking with a limp
But I teach her how to act, 101 like ...
Put my 187 on that undercover cop
