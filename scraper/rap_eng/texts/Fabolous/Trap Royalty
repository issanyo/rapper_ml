[Chorus: Mike Davis (Fabolous)]
Trap king need a trap queen
Every trap king need a trap queen, yeah
Trap king need a trap queen
Every trap king need a trap queen, yeah yeah

Every trap king need a trap queen, yeah
(Miss each other while we do our trap ting
But when we link you already know the happenin')

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
She gotta hustle like my hustle, so I figure she for me
And we both chasin' dreams so it's bigger than money
When I met her, she was grindin' and I was diggin' that youngin'
Was chasin' money but she wasn't chasin' niggas with money
And she a hustler, all she needed was that support system
I cashed out, she stacked up went out and bought business
Most girls woulda' copped bags and bought Christians
I ain't judgin' I'ma save it for the court system
I just see that she 'bout somethin' and thought different
And if it ain't about nothin', then she abort mission
Ya boy vision is get money and avoid prison
And shorty make sure that the boy isn't
Slippin' or slackin' or trippin' or lackin'
I save that up front dough and flip all the back ends
Trap King done got to the throne from the dungeon
Rockin' that Trapstar from New York to London, yeah

[Chorus: Mike Davis (Fabolous)]
Trap king need a trap queen
Every trap king need a trap queen, yeah
Trap king need a trap queen
Every trap king need a trap queen, yeah yeah
Trap king need a trap queen
Every trap king need a trap queen, yeah
(Miss each other while we do our trap ting
But when we link you already know the happenin')

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Trap king need a trap queen that's royalty
Told her we'll be rich forever, that's loyalty
Baby get whatever from papa, that's spoilty
Hustle like Russell so I need a young Kimora Lee
Both from the mud so we know know that soil be
Don't slip but we know how slick that, that oil be
Gotta keep a stash for the bail and that lawyer fee
Still play Santa 'cause I got her every toy you see
Rolex crowns, his and her accordingly
And we drink royally, the Vodka is Royal Elite
Cheers to the new deal, cheers to the new wheels
Feels like thrones and they even give massages
What the car cost is, shit, give you menages
House like a castle but come from the projects
Dead all that lil shit 'cause we live the largest
Dead all that lil shit yeah we live the largest

[Chorus: Mike Davis (Fabolous)]
Trap king need a trap queen
Every trap king need a trap queen, yeah
Trap king need a trap queen

We got to take risks and prosper
Fuck all that fake shit and gossip (yeah, yeah)
We tryna eat, we want that steak with the lobster
Matter of fact, make it with pasta, room for dessert (yeah, yeah)
I got some cake mix in boxes, whip it up make it a Boxster
Hop off the porch, hop in the Porsche
Hop into mine and you hop into yours
Different rides, same destination in the nav', nigga (yeah)
Ain't no hesitation on the ave, nigga (yeah)
Fuck the reservation that you have, nigga (yeah)
We buy the preservation, livin lav', nigga
I wouldn't cater that 9 to 5, all up and down that I-95
Can't kill my hustle, so I'm alive
And if I die bet my grind survives
Johan and Jonas gon' sit where that throne is
Make sure they notice and don't go unnoticed
Those my trap Princes, hope they find a Princess
That way my boys'll livin' trap royalty
(That way my boys'll livin' trap royalty)
That way my boys'll livin' trap royalty
