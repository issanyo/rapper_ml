It's time to get money
I got a million reasons why I'm better than them (a million)
Yeah (I'm about to give you one right now)
It's Loso in case you ain't know so baby; let get right into it

What's really the dilly with these silly muhfuckas
Buncha fake ass Milli Vanilli muhfuckas
Yet still these muhfuckas say they feel these muhfuckas
But I only smoke Dutches I don't feel these muhfuckas
They gon pull and shoot what?
No really muhfucka
You gon run, prolly pull ya achilly muhfucka
Nigga please, you wouldn't pop a wheelie muhfucka
You wouldn't raise the heat if you was chilly muhfucka
I will kill these muhfuckas
Till' these muhfuckas know that I Am Legend
Call me Big Willy muhfucka
I'm wit Freck Billi and some West Philly muhfuckas
And you can be a vic if you get silly muhfucka
So if you feelin froggy leap that lily muhfucka
And I'll serve yo fruity ass like Wet Willies muhfucka
I'm like Obama to these silly muhfuckas
And you niggas is Clinton, Hill Billy muhfuckas
Niggas said you niggas is Clinton. Hill Billy muhfuckers
Hillary, Bill Clin--Fuck it. They don't get it

I am a million-aire in some Louis V millionaires
White bucket like Gilligan wear
La familia in here, don't care who over there
Red rover red rover send them bitches over here
You can also send the waiter, yeah I think his name Ramon
Tell his slow ass to c'mon wit that Grey Goose and Patron
Tryna get em in the zone da da da zone
So I can pick and roll like Stockton and Malone
Ya smell me, nah baby not my cologne
Let me be clear as some Bacardi Limon
Looky here Simone, you can call the phone
But if you ain't tryna bone you'll be talkin to the tone
I'm so cocky that all I wanna do is bone
I'm so Rocky my last name should be Stallone
I ain't Jimmy baby, I ain't here to Jones
Fuck whatcha talkin bout....its Los
