[Hook: Red Cafe]
Boss bitches and fast cars
Look I'm back stuntin' my ass off
Got the drinks on ice and the watch on ice
Now the hoes feeling nice
Every year my year dog
You know how we give it up over here dog
Got the drinks on ice and the watch on ice
Now the hoes feeling nice

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
I only give a fuck bout my team
Now all the bad bitches fuck my team
Look i measure stacks with a ruler
Im getting googled by the youngins and the cougars
Got a team of dimes working at hooters
These niggas wearing fake Gold trying to fool us
My female friends they all boogie
Off that molly courtsey of yours truly
Yeah every hood red good!
Baby girl life easy, if you head good
I feel like i got wings on
Chain so heavy them slim bitches can swing on...

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Look! I ain´t got to tell a story..(Facts!)
I get to it and let the money tell it for me...(Facts!)
I turn my J´s to a black and yellow forie
Now thats a street nigga cinderella story..(Word!)
Time is money in the sky i dwell at 40
So in the City i be Car-Melo scorin
Wack bitch I´m not the fella for you
I cut a dame off... Roc a fella shorty...(shortyyy)
My bitch look way outta your budget
The hoes they talkin about she make´em change the subject
Thats how we give it up over here Boy
Got shots, got strong...Team Steroids!

[Verse 3 - Pusha T]
Red, you know we shared us like a couple
Them VA Girls used to ride them Lex Bubbles
Fab, you know we shared us like a couple
In B.K. they like they bad boys with a duffle
I´m looking for trouble, a pair made of double
We all knew the play I ain't have to call the huddle
The perk´s when you ballin like the Heat do
South Beach the whole condo is see through
Atlantic Ocean backdrop has us see blue
We was sea sick fuckin with them Sea-Doo´s
Talk Money and them nights to remember
Get your feelins crushed like the ice in a blender
(Gone!)
