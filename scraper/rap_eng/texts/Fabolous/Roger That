[Intro: Freck Billionaire]
Breaker, breaker 1-9
I am here now and all the competition are dead
There are no survivors
I'm here now, I repeat there all dead, do you copy

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Roger That
Ra-Ra-Roger That
My team about green, Rondo roger that
I take the la to the head like a Dodger hat
I do it big baby, where they do it larger at
These niggas dead, where the hell they charger at
These bitches washed up, straight out of the laundromat
I'm so far ahead of my rivals
When I show up it kills em, dead on arrival
They said New York was dead but I led the revival
I guess I'm just built to last, bred for survival
Unstoppable, unbreakable
I keep one nine like breaker-breaker do
Shorty say what it do is what I make 'er do
Get her on the first shot, yea one take, boo
Now she need the black mamba badder then the Lakers do
I d-d-t the pussy, I'm Jake the Snake to you
I put em in the coffin, I'm the Undertaker too
She met the God now her man gonna meet his maker too
What's beef? That questions mistakeable
I mean I done had a well-done stake or two
But as far as rap niggas go, we slaughter cows
Apron on, tape a song, flow slaughter house
You niggas porterhouse, filet, t-bone
I'm Macaulay Culkin homes, leave me alone
I'm in the zone, who want some of this college D
You sorry ass niggas owe me an apology
I'm about a dolla-G, master in grindology
Groupie-ass niggas must have took Astrology
Cause all they do is follow stars
Pride won't di-gest we don't swallow ours
Swagger out this world, I get my style from Mars
You add that with the fact that Loso spittin asylum bars
You understand why competition is extinct
Them boys is gone, word to N'Sync
I'm the black Timberlake in black Timbalands
They all dead you could send back the ambulance

[Intro 2: Freck Billionaire]
Breaker, breaker 1-9
This is West Philly Freck
He wasn't lying, theres no competition left
Nothing but dead rappers everywhere
Fake chains all over the ground everywhere
Please stand by

[Verse 2: Freck Billionaire]
It's West Philly Freck stunting on the breaker, break
I put them oils in the hood like Quaker State
OG Kush yes I do the wake and bake
I got them circles and them squares bitch take a shape
So holla at me if you niggas tryna find a key
I get that ass tuned up like Meineke
Mr. Bar for Bar rappers need to buy a line
I get you VIP passes to the flyathon
I be running through shutting down mad spots
Out in Short Hills Mall I'm the mascot
In Alaska, you couldn't find a colder nigga
I still push it in the hood like a stroller nigga
I still crack the block up like Meet the Browns
And if your money right I might let you meet the pounds
I pop rose like the shit is Miller Draft
I'm so cool that them young bitches feel a draft
Street Fam, bo y, yes we the casket flowas
West Philly Freck, I will get your casket lowered
I dare tomorrow, breaker breaker 1 9er
It's the mutha fucking king of all the one liners
A hundred thousand for the watch, yall chipped in
And I ain't ask them for a bargain I just chipped in
Down in Bar Harbor when I hit a shop or two
I got that amex that look like Shaka Zulu
On some real shit motherfucker credit score
Cause when you got the cake, what you need the credit for
I'm usually in the cut like nip/tuck
Or that tangerine coop getting lip-sucked
That's just how we go down when the woman kick it
They know I'm gettin money like the winning ticket
West Philly Freck, I be on that road strapped
When it' comes to being fly I'm the road map

[Outro: Fabolous]
Oh my God this beyond what you could have imagined
This is, this is this is worse then the Black Plague
I never seen anything of this kind of devastation
Um it's of catastrophic proportions
I think we have a instinction level event on our hands
Dead bodys everywhere
Eww it reeks of dead rapper down here
I'm gonna need to get outta here
Roger that
