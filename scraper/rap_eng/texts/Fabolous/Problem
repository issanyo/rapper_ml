[Hook: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I had a problem
I had to eat so I was a robber
I got a problem
I bought a Wraith
I fucked up the ‘Rari
I got a problem
I was a target
Now I’m a topic
I got a problem
I sleep with my watches
Fucking my arm up
I got a problem
Grizzley a monster
I am a monster
I got a problem
Loso a monster
Don is a monster
I had a problem
Cause of the dead man
Now he a zombie
You got a problem
You got a gang and I got an army

[Verse 1: Tee Grizzley]
These niggas ain’t killers
But these niggas kill me
My bullets 3 dollars a piece
These niggas gon’ feel me
My niggas rocking that real ice
When the lights off
You can still see
This shit I’m rapping the real me
I hit yo hoe
That’s the real Tee
Who the GOAT?
Who the GOAT?
Tee, you and Grizzley
But nigga you the GOAT
Ran up the miles on the Wraith
We just orchestrating how to run in jewelry stores
Shooter shot everybody
Why he do that?
Cause he ain’t know who to smoke
They got a problem
With me and my niggas
But they ain’t gon’ do shit though
Loso a legend
She tryna fuck me and Boogie to meet him
When I got a problem
We gotta solve it
Somebody bleeding
I don’t got a jewelry box
When I don’t wear it
This shit in the freezer
My diamond link hold a monster
Try to snatch this
You won’t make it to meet her

[Verse 2: Don Q]
I got a problem with bitches who just sit in the house and just argue in pictures
I got a problem with niggas who just wanna come out and party with niggas
‘Cause if it go down in the club
Is you gon’ pullout and target them niggas
I pullout the card as my foot out the ‘Rari
I spin through the trap where they argue with niggas
Teaching you how to be bosses
Rule number one: You gotta be cautious
Sit at your thrown with your strap
‘Cause niggas be planning on knocking me off it
I turn my home to a trap
You want a pound?
Just come to my office
I turn my hoe to a brat
Gucci, Chanel, I got it imported
Tracing the steps that we took
They tryna study the strategy
We came in the game
We gained some power
Now they tryna copy your majesty
I think them people is after me
They tapping my phone and they hacking me
Been through the pain and the agony
Fuck it
I go on the run ‘til they capture me

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Went from
Locked up
No bail
No love
No mail
Now it’s 5-star hotels, mansions, doorbells
Came from hoopties, 4 deep, 2 heats, no Ls
Now we ride in foreign, new R-O-Ls
Got one question: Why you niggas so jeal’?
They wish they had my chain
I’m like, “Oh well.”
Old ass wifey, okay C-O-O-L
Still caught that in New York
Word to Odell
He got a problem
He got a China
She tryna rob him
The head is a problem
Shawty be weaving
Shawty be dodging
I be in Gotham
Me and my hammer
Batman and Robin
Green like the Goblin
I’m Peter Parker
Swinging through Harlem, look
Bitch I’m a hero
Niggas is robbers
Parish, they zeros
Bitch I’m a problem
I’m getting Robert
I mean Dinero
I know more problem
Come with more money
Get it and solve them
Niggas be starving
And die over shit
That doesn’t involve them
