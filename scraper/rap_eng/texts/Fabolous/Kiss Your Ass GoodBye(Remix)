[Intro: Sheek Louch]
Hahaha
Ya'll know what this is
D-Block
Oh yeah by the way
This is the remix
Whoooo!

[Hook: Sheek Louch]
You can kiss your ass good-bye
D-Block D-Block D-Block D-Block
La da da da da da

[Verse 1- Sheek Louch]
Ayo the flow is here, the dough is here
They gon' call this the hardest remix of the year
The wrist is sickled, the nine is nickled
The inside tanned, the outer pickled
The dutch is rolled, the yak is poured
You runnin' your mouth, I'm gettin' you jawed
I'm wavin' the blade, I'm tellin' you back up
You empty your pockets, I'm pickin' your pack up
You can act stupid if you wanna
Like you don't know what block I'm in front of
I'm out in New York or down in the south
I'm out in the trap with gold in my mouth
They booked me for the clubs in the hood
Where niccas scared to go but Sheek Louch good
Its loaded when I get out the car like la da da da da

[Hook: Sheek Louch]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Yeah D-Block
They say hate spread faster than love
So the Bentley is black, same color as the mask and the gloves
With me, I'mma send a bastard a bub
Before he get a police to first and last ????
These dickhead niggas, you shoot 'em they bleed cum
And two pussies they with, just makin' a threesome
They growin' up quick, you gotta buy your seed guns
Matic spray magazines before they could read one
My glass jaws had a hell of a we run
La da da da da da as we proceed son
And I know, every hood got a street flame if not they need one
I'm thinkin' short range, give me a sport range
And when it get warmer, I'm jumpin' in the stormer
Duck when I'm passin' by
Put your head between your legs, kiss your ass good-bye, braaa

[Hook: Sheek Louch]

[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]
You niggas lost ya'll game, I'm throwin' a rock down
Just to put ya'll D, I'm back on the block now
Runnin' your mouth, 'fore I shit all in it
All ya'll ass and I'm about to dig all in it
I birthed you niccas, I fed and I burped you niccas
Quick as that, I will urf you niccas
Clothed you niggas, wiped the snot from the nose of you niggas
Want not to expose you niggas, fist knife or razor fight
I got a year in the day, still played it like they gave me life
Can't walk through the jail without shackles and two cops
Throwin' shit on the warden outta the food slop
Got connects with pop, he boofin' the weed plants
Get my cackies washed, I'm pressed for the food stamps
Respected in the jail, a check in the mail
I stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill
You let them DC niggas have secks in your cell
You live with a gun, you like gettin' hit from the front
You stay on some ish like two !!s with no chick
Rumor has it you like your chicks with no !!
FYI your PSI said you snitch, how you blow trial and stay on rich
Now its time to set it off
You got somethin' on ya chest man the tec'll tear it off muaah
