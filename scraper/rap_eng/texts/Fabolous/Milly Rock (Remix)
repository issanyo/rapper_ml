Meek Milly cocked on them Philly blocks

Straight up, but my bitch curvy
My shit clean but my piss dirty

Now she with the team, now she with the team
And we really poppin' them tags
We really droppinâ€™ them bags
Them diamonds really be dancin'

Do two milli in the summertime, now you Milly Rockin' like Fab
Word on the street's your bitch is Milly Rockin' the Ave
Giving mad neck they say she really like a giraffe (ha!)
