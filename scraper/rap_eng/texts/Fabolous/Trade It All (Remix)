Fabolous:

P.Diddy ::talking over jagged edge::
(yeah whoa) This the moment they all been waiting for playboy (ok)
We here now we in the house now for sure
Check this out, im tired of playing games
And yes im definantly sure ill trade it all
Fabolous

(Chorus - Jagged Edge)
Girl I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl I'd trade it all

Fabolous:
I assumed im so into you
Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends with you
When they ask I ain't gotta say whom in them interviews
My sweetthing never believe them rumors that been the truth
Like I had numerous friends its true
But you was wifey can chase me to a room in a minute boo
Maybe, my sense of humer gets into you
But girl they can make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you away for like june and december to
So what you think about cancun till the winter through
I dont know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a days decide to go to blooms and just spend with you
Like any other man I would of zoomed to the clinic to
Now I wanna see if me and my juniors identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear that everything, that same afternoon he'll be in the news
Feel me?

(Chorus - Jagged Edge)
Girl I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl I'd trade it all
Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl I'd trade it all

P. Diddy:
Yo
Come here girl, come and take a walk with me
So I could, take you places you dont often be
Come on ma, come and get lost with me
As far as the other chicks can't get em off of me
Everlasting love in a whole other fashion
All im asking let me cash in

Cause id give all the cash in, all of the Sean John fashion
Im already flashing perhaps when
You figure out, exactly what diddy bout
If we could take this whole city out
Now who gonna stop us, who gonna knock us
Top us, we can't find coppers to lock us
Liah jets and choppers, love hella propers
Separate the weak for the obster
Leap hard to keep I got cha, I rock ya
Word to big poppa, I got cha
Yeah

(Chorus)
(P. Diddy Talking)
(uh..yeah)
Id give this all up for you shorty (now what you want huh?)
Get cha mind right, ride with me (now what you want huh?)
Take this for me, fabolous come on

Fabolous:
Yo
This newcomers known, to move with the seasons
Couple winter lodges, few summer homes
Im there for every eww um and moan
And make sure when the new hummer roam, the shoes coming chrome
I ain't going buying white yellow and cucumber stones
That same shit the sewer woman bones
But life gets gruesome alone
Even though I got that kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Lights out I flew some alone
Now I wanna wake up everyday with you in a new number zone
Mamamia, its you ima phone
Just to erase, all the negative views from your dome
And I promise this fellas G
And so can stay in the calm over jealous and drama you telling me
So mama come yell at me
So i can put the top down and we can cruise like tom and Penelope
My charm is a felony

(Chorus)
(P.Diddy talking)
Yeah there it is, diddy
Desert storm, rock on and rock on
Bad boy, yeah, rock on rock on
DJ CLUE, DURU
Rock on rock on
Trade it all baby
And thats a lot
For real, stop playing
Holla at your boy, stop playing
