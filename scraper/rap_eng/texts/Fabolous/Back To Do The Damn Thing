Just keeps callin me man
Just keeps callin me

Im hooked

Im back to do the damn thing (x4)

Feel like the ex champ back in the title fight
The young contenders are lookin at me in idol light
Fresh taper, waves lookin title tight
Yea I'm in the building, like a Corey Lidal flight
I'm married to the streets, this is my recital right
I got the Phantom drop dressed up bridal white
Hehe, you know them doors are suicidal right?
Sorta like they slit your wrists when I'm tryin to sit your miss
Nigga picture this, like a Kodak moment
I'm off the bullshit, 'bout to go back on it
And I ain't hard to find, bet ya Lojack on it
Call it corn row roof, cause it go back don't it?
I gotta get it now, ain't no pension plan rappin
Fuck bein friends, save me the hand dappin
Understand captain, you'll be under land nappin
If you keep thinkin that it can't when it can happen
Ask Scarface, faster than a car chase
At ya grandma's place, lettin AR's waste
Sports Coupe, not too much car space
The trunk look like Desperados guitar case
If you say a thing wrong, I won't let it string long
All I gotta do is push the button like ding-dong
I don't play the back and forth game 'less it's ping-pong
Mike Tyson flow, so I ain't in the ring long
Nigga you ain't King Kong, thinkin that you bit shit
You gon have your man sick, someone sing his theme song
My nigga Freck plugged me in with this Beijing joint
So hot, she play Alaskan with a string thong
Real delicate, I just call her China Set
Fendi fur, Gucci gators, guess she like designer pets
She saw a few things, that get her vagina wet
SF, G4, and it's not a niners jet
But check the body drop, baby boy shittin
But it's just sittin, so it's like I made a potty stop
It's like karate chops, we be breakin bricks down
Cocaine tour, I been through six towns
Open with crack as the openin act
Heroin headliner, stage name China
(What you call that?!) That's what you call a trap star
I could get the kingpin charged for these rap bars

That's right nigga, we still do this shit
Man on the street tip too man, we touch things
Knah mean like the body shop we touch shit up man
Get this shit movin man, it's Loso
Big shout to that Street Fam, what it look like y'all?
What's goin on Brooklyn?
It's your boy, I'm back man
We got Brooklyn lookin better than ever now man
These niggas can't fuck around man
I'm back to do the damn thing
