[Chorus]
Leave you, I never meant to
Leave you, I never meant to
Leave you, I never meant to
Leave you, I never meant to

[Verse 1]
I guess making sure that you good was my bad
I kinda thought you had the same feelings I had
And you helped sell it like a fly ad
But you was mac'in out the house, iPad
Not mad, but there's a few disappointments
Let’s just say that I canceled all the few appointments
I blew paper with you, not a joint, bitch
I say bitch when I'm tryna make a point, bitch
Other times I call it how I see it
I won't give you the title if you don’t know how to be it
Which proves, I love it when the shit's smooth
But show yo' ass to yo' nigga, that's a bitch move
I’ma ride but what are you about yo
You gon' pull a Trey and say let me out Dough
Never saw it coming, what a cheap shot
Your strongest enemies the one who know ya weak spot

[Chorus]
Leave you, I never meant to
Leave you, I never meant to
Leave you, I never meant to
Leave you, I never meant to

[Verse 2]
I kinda wonder if I cross ya mind
Maybe you my ex 'cause you crossed the line
Maybe you just never saw the crossing signs
'Cause the hand up means don't walk
We don’t talk, and somewhere there's a disconnection
You take it the wrong way so much misdirection
Baby what it is, tell me what it does
This is what it is, fuck what it was
But it was good while it lasted
But when its dead let it go, put it in a casket
And don't dig it back up, got my swagger back up
I pick up to call you then I hang it back up
Yeah, and I'ma get back to 'em
To know a backstabber, gotta turn ya back to 'em
Well maybe its just me and I'm going crazy
But let me ask you this, where you going baby?

[Chorus]
Leave you, I never meant to
Leave you, I never meant to
Leave you, I never meant to
Leave you, I never meant to
