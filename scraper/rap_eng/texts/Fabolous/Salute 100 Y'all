One hundred if you real, dawg
This for my squad, my hood, my street, my city
My real niggas all across the world, fuck with me, yeah
Salute, salute, one hundred y'all
Salute, salute, one hundred y'all
My young niggas, to the OG's
Never said a word to the police
One hundred if you real, dawg
I said one hundred if you real, dawg

I'm one hunnid, go ahead, let's speak on it
Church nigga, I preach on it
Authentic like Meech on it
Same nigga I start with, out the gutter, ate garbage
Same niggas I bought cars with, shrimp, steak, and ate marvelous
And while you playin' ball, tryna D up
I'm with Tiger Woods playin' golf, tryna tee up
Find me at the crib with my feet up
While niggas on the block, off the corner, screamin' "We up!"
This for the hood, and everybody ain't make it
There's paper out there, if you don't want it, I take it
Yeah, if you don't want it, I take it
There's paper in the hood, if you don't want it, I take it

This for my squad, my hood, my street, my city
My real niggas all across the world, fuck with me, yeah
Salute, salute, one hundred y'all
Salute, salute, one hundred y'all
My young niggas, to the OG's
Never said a word to the police
One hundred if you real, dawg
I said one hundred if you real, dawg

[Money J:]
I been there and I done that, and I still pop my gun
My Louis blue and my rag blue and I'm always one hundred
My top down and my Loc's on, any block that I post on
Go and get my West Coast on, Louis belt with my toast on
Just came to put my folks on, guess what?
Clubbed 'em
Every time I hit the city, they screamin' out:
"We love him!"
I'm a real nigga that love real niggas
Not a hate bone in my body
In every state that I touchdown
Real niggas, they got me
It's all in my talk, it's all in my walk
It's in me, not on me
It's somethin' that can't be taught
I'm a real nigga that do real shit
Killed niggas I done killed with
You talk about, then be about it
Half of y'all ain't built for this

This for my squad, my hood, my street, my city
My real niggas all across the world, fuck with me, yeah
Salute, salute, one hundred y'all
Salute, salute, one hundred y'all
My young niggas, to the OG's
Never said a word to the police
One hundred if you real, dawg
I said one hundred if you real, dawg

[Fabolous:]
Start salutin', the director's here, start the movie
I yell "action", these young niggas'll start to shootin'
I had a dream that I'd be rich, call that Martin Lutin'
Cause bein' broke was immature, word to Marques Houston
For the top dog that once was the underdog
See him shinin' well he came from bein' under fog
One hunnid, dawg
They can't stomach, dawg
A hundred bottles last night, now here come the blogs
One nation under God, now here come the feds
Where them choppers lay 'em down, they should come with beds
If you ain't with a real nigga, then who are you with?
Keep ridin' with a fake nigga, see how far you get

This for my squad, my hood, my street, my city
My real niggas all across the world, fuck with me, yeah
Salute, salute, one hundred y'all
Salute, salute, one hundred y'all
My young niggas, to the OG's
Never said a word to the police
One hundred if you real, dawg
I said one hundred if you real, dawg
