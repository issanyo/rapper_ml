[Intro: Fabolous]
Ain't nothin' funny about not gettin' this money man
What's funny about that?
You niggas got it twisted man

[Hook - Fabolous]
I'm like ha ha ha ha ha you niggas make me laugh
C'mon if it don't make me math
I'm like ha ha ha ha ha what you can't take a joke?
Well I can't take bein' broke
I'm like ha ha ha ha ha, make money money money
Ha ha ha ha ha,  money money money

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
You niggas are comical, who me?
I'm seven digits two comma cool, on my mama fool
I'm gettin' this money and that kill'em
They lookin' at a pimp funny, I'm Katt Williams
Money Mike, I get money on the mic
And some say I'm wild'n out
In a Bugatti stylin' out, pushin' seven digits, dialin' out
But I ain't got a fuckin' choice
My money talks in a Chris Tucker voice
"And you know this man"
You a stand up rapper, hip hop comedian
I start laughin' as soon as I put your CD in
You joke, you joke, you kid, you kid
Should have went to Comedy Central with the vids you did
But ok, you on B.E.T. only if its Comic View
Promise you I'm funny style, I can be a comic too
I'm Marty Mar, add a Audemars
Cute snotty broad, tits like Dolly Par
Ed Hardy naw this is Cardi ma
But that was a good one, hardy har
Lambo Gallardi car getting my last laugh HAW

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Pusha T]
The jokes on you niggas
See the figures don't add up to the claims
You Sam Kinnison, you just screamin' names
My brother my partner for real like the Wayans
Plus everything in live In Living Color
High rise check diamonds the size of Robin Harris' eyes
I Bebe Kids my neck
You call it a tribute, or proof that I distribute
Sales was slow I got Paco to contribute
Some mores in each state, move weight, get caught
Don't talk, Dave Chappelle niggas might break
So hilarious, how chariots, carry us
The Phantom is light gray sort of like Ashy Larry is
King of the one liners lil' rhymers watch what you say
You just a potty mouth like Andrew Dice Clay
I pop collars on niggas, I drop dollars on niggas
I jell O's together, I Bill Cosby on niggas
Got you lost in the smoke, I Micheal Colyar you niggas
Or watch you burst into fire, I Richard Pryor you niggas
Said enough nigga sort of like Kramer
I'm jokin' you don't wanna see the anger
Fab tell'em

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
Mane look, the diamonds in your chain look
Funnier than Dane Cook, you hit the Sufi
I am to fly, in the booth I make joke of them
I ain't the richest nigga but I ain't broke as them
I'm serious, petty worth
I make a man delirious like Eddie Murph, girls get curious
Is he really funny? Don't be silly honey
I'm the burner packing, Bernie Mac'in
I ain't scared of you mafuckers kick ass
Hon stack thick ass, a deck of card VIP section hard
They try to holla at me you know the heckler broads
I'm poppin' Rose, I don't do the neck to God
Don't front yo, I be in the front row
Watch your wise cracks or I'll be at your front door
And I push up on a female smoothly, in a GL but keep that on the D.L. Hughley
LOL this is LOS
Oh no your money's coming so slow
I guess this mafuckers a no show
Oh oh oh

[Hook]
