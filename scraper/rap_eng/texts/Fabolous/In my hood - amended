Im always close to, feeling like a corner stander stoop to sit on, hallway post up. No matter where i go its always post up, feels just like it IN MY HOOD, cops drive in it every 5 minutes. Look at your faces pat your waistes, try to find a stash where the gats and base is, i can't say that they racist. But i know it ain't the same in they town and as fucked up as it may sound IN MY HOOD, theres two ways to make it happen off the streets, balling on the courts or rapping off the beats. You hear the shells tapping off the crete and they clapping off the heat then the yellow tapes trapping off the street. But thats the way we were raised praying to god hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays

They drink til the cups dry, eat til the plates clean, niggas be in state greens before they turn 18, round here you never let the beat slide twice, everybody raised on four wings and beef fried rice. The mothers are getting younger today, got one in the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way. We dont have role models but we got those hand guns that hold hollows IN MY HOOD. Ain't no diploams or degrees, but you can get high from the aroma of the trees IN MY HOOD. I know it like navigation and fuck having patience, im gonna get mine you better get yours, cause every day is a struggle and one time ride through everyday just to bug you. Thats how it is cause your rights be wrong and everybody got a white T on when you in my hood

We try to make the most of what we got, you either been hit of been close to getting shot IN MY HOOD, any nigga who pulls be getting got and dope heads fiend to get a dose of what we got. Young niggas be like they slow but you give them a blunt, bet they roll the weed like a pro, if you a chick it nots a problem to get you laid, but if you stick without a condom itll get you aids. No sesame street kids, watch BET, look up to niggas that ain't got a G.E.D, i know a dude with the deadbeat tag, kids dont got diapers but hes riding in the red g wag. In the hood you and your hoods is sure to bump heads and everybody grew up sleeping on a bunk bed there telling me to vote... and i would if it make a change in my hood. Motherfucker
