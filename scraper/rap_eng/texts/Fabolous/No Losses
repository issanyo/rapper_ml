[Hook]
You in the presence of a street nigga
I’m just tryna keep my plate full
Hammer on my hip you wanna play fool
Know I gotta keep figures
I’ve been wilding out since grade school
Stay out on that corner where that weight move
I ain’t taking losses here from nobody
Fly nigga I’ve been bossin’ since my nose snotty
I ain’t taking losses here from nobody
Yea I came up out the ghetto as a nobody

[Verse 1]
Ayo where they taking losses at I ain’t from that town
Silverback Gorilla Yonkers nigga back em down
Clap at your block leave then come back around
Started with grams look at me now famous as a motherfucker
My career is lit and my Dutch is lit, about to get into some shit
You see them foreign cars pull up then you know it’s us
My nigga’s got their orange on getting off the bus
20,000 on his commissary doing time but his murder was involuntary
Lil hustling nigga with his dreams of getting bigger
Then I started rapping bitch

[Hook]
You in the presence of a street nigga
I’m just tryna keep my plate full
Hammer on my hip you wanna play fool
Know I gotta keep figures
I’ve been wilding out since grade school
Stay out on that corner where that weight move
I ain’t taking losses here from nobody
Fly nigga I’ve been bossin’ since my nose snotty
I ain’t taking losses here from nobody
Yea I came up out the ghetto as a nobody

[Verse 2]
I came out of the mud brush the dirt off
I be riding no top with my shirt off
Always been a cool nigga piss the nerds off
Bergdorf looking like I knock birds off yea baby everything is for sale
They gotta feel what I’m saying like everything is in brail
You will point us out use everything finger to tell
Go and talk to the cops do heavy singing Adele
So we don’t fuck with you niggas and ain’t exchanging no numbers
Cus I don’t talk to frauds and I hate changing my number
We ain’t taking no losses like we undefeated nigga
You can overstand that I’ll be undefeated my nigga

[Hook]
You in the presence of a street nigga
I’m just tryna keep my plate full
Hammer on my hip you wanna play fool
Know I gotta keep figures
I’ve been wilding out since grade school
Stay out on that corner where that weight move
I ain’t taking losses here from nobody
Fly nigga I’ve been bossin’ since my nose snotty
I ain’t taking losses here from nobody
Yea I came up out the ghetto as a nobody

[Outro]
You in the presence of a street nigga
I ain't talking losses
I ain't talking losses
