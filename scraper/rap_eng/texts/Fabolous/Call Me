See ma, I think you took it
I think you took it wrong like
You got it misunderstood or something
You got it confused

I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together
(I mean, when was this ma?)
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever
(I never said that, I never said forever)
Call meee (Na, I don't do this. You already knew this, ma we been thru this)
Call meee (Na, I can't do that, once I done blew that. Ma, we been thru that)

Girl, that was a one night fling
You was turned on by the moonshine and the sunlight bling
You kept licking your tongue at me, knowing how quick that this young'n be
To pull out his dick from his dungarees
Besides, we had enough liquor and jungle trees
That both of us woulda got sick or had lung disease
I remember every gesture made (ooh)
During the escapade (ooh)
In the back of the Escalade (whoa)
When it come to tricks, I have some up my sleeve (uh huh)
But Shorty dived in head first and didn't come up to breathe (shit)
I usually don't get to rag em (uh)
But it's so real, I made the caddy chauffer hop out and get the magnums (uhhhh)
We getting close the Parker Meridian (uh huh)
She pulling her skirt down (uh huh)
And tucking her titties in (uh huh)
I'm walking this biddy in (uh huh)
Caressing her pretty skin
She said "I love the video that you and P. Diddy in" (yeah right)

This girl hobby was to slob me down (uh)
Got me walking wobbly thru the lobby lounge (ohh)
In the pent house blasting Mobb Deep and some Bobby Brown (uh huh)
Do not disturb sign probably woulda not be found (yeah)
If theres one thing I'm giving her, it gotta be back shots (uh)
She screaming like she just won the lottery jack pot (ahhh) (uh)
At the same time she jerking and wiggling (uh huh)
Smirking and giggling (ha ha ha)
Cuz I'm like Dirk when I'm digging in (uh)
The way she working and figuring
She must have be a gymnast
Cuz the positions wasn't hurting her ligaments
Ma I know you got centerfold measurement features (uh huh)
But after a nut, it was a pleasure to meet ya (uh huh)
Get ya under and outta wear (uh)
You ain't gotta go home, but you gotta get outta here
So write your number on this paper (uh)
I might wanna scrape ya (uh)

And she still calling and paging (what the fuck)
I don't even know how she got my numbers (damn)
But I been hiding (uh huh)
Cuz, this girl looking for the kid like Bush was searching for Bin Laden (damn)
Before I didn't care if she where I be (ut uh)
But now I mean it be scaring me (uh huh)
To get year of free therapy (uh huh)
She said her heart broken; it caused her to start smoking (uhhh)
And the hours of deep thinking, making her keep drinking (uhhh)
Since Hiedi started stalking me (uh huh)
I hadda get body guards to walk with me (yeah)
If you wanna get Fabolous, that's on you, that's on you (okay)
Long as you know they at on you (I said okay)

Hoping that this don't turn into a fatal attraction (ut uh)
She screaming "fabolous give me one more chance
Fabolous give me one more chance" PLEASE?!
