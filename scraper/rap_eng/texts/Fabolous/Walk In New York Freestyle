[Intro]
All my niggas in Brooklyn, and ya don't stop
Uptown, and ya don't stop
Boogie down, and ya don't stop
Queens, and ya don't stop
Staten Isle, and ya don't stop
Long Isle and ya don't stop

It's the -
I ain't got all day for this shit man
Let me get my money, let's go

[Verse]
Yo I'm riding this addiction
Yeah but its American-made
You know crack rock magnum heroin laid (yes)
Interior suede pair of them blades 06-07 was the year they been made
I mean L-O-S-O clearly I'm paid
White and canaries is laid [?]
Your boy be, wearing them shades, tearing them day
With the tape up on the Cesar I ain't wearing the fade
Might catch me in the [?] with a pretty hoe
One way outta hand a braids and a video
Cooler then the air in the shade she's a Diddy tho
And she likes carry and blaze, kinda gritty yo
Stand here and be sprayed, hit ya leg and ya make the same screams Mason Carrigan made (ahh)
Better learn 'bout homes, I got burn out chrome
Use it or lose it like burn out foams, nigga
And you talking like it something new
I just hopped outta the car that you jumped into
Bitch how you cool with [?] fella humping you?
When you know hes turning back to a pumpkin boo
When the clock hit fab, it might get the attention that 'Pac shit grab
When I caught McNabb
But I can tuck the eagle and just rock with jabs
I'm quick, nigga you would rather box with Zab
I stay fly they should call me cockpit Fab
Nigga my swag is on autopilot (yes)
Hemmy wit the semi had to auto my shit (yes)
Flying first biz auto my shit (yes)
Scream Brooklyn when I win, just like Big did it
Bentley in the projects, just like Jig did it
Nah I'm really the street La Familia, rah rah
I'm killing ya, most know it's Loso
