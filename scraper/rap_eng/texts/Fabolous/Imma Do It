[Intro/Hook: Kobe]
The block got my back
And my boys do too
And my baby mama trippin
Said she need more loot
Every block
Every hood
Every ghetto got beef
I got a heater on my lap
And another in the back
Shit, how I’m supposed to cope
With all this stress on me?
Er'body and their mama callin fed's on me
I don't know what I'm a do but I'm a Do It (I'm a Do It)
Look I don't know what I'm a do but I'm a Do It (I'm a Do It)
I got money on my head but I'm ridin in a drop, (drop)
Drop, (drop)
Drop, (drop)
Drop, (drop)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yeahhhhh!
Feelin just like JFK
In the city that let em fly like JFK (Ayyye)
Sometimes LaGaurdia
I ain't gone lie to ya
If looks could kill
Then my style might body ya
That's why I'm with naudia
I call my gun naudia
When she say hi to ya it's
Buh buh bye to ya
Make it sound like Saudi
Arabia
Maybe
The haters should
Watch what he say to her
You think
I can hold my head high and die
Or I can live and duck
My attitude is celibate
I don't give a fuck

Drop, (drop)
Drop, (drop)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Yeahhhhh!
Now who are you to tell me
How to conduct myself
Why don't you go practice safe sex
And go fuck yourself
The rumor is that I'm a hazzard to a sucka's health
I coulda told you that
Yeah I coulda told you that
Picture me
Not fly
Where are them exposures at?
Right here
On my lap
That's where my composure's at
I'm back like a gun cock
I'm so cool that
If I go to hell
All I need is my sun block
Nigga hold ya high and die
Or live and duck
My attitude is celibate
I don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I mean let's be honest
You never liked a nigga
Tryna lesbian-us
So I kept the strap on
Clap off
Clap on
Lights out
Like flights out
You could be departed
Never me who started
I Lambo Gallarded
I am vehically challenged
That means the car is retarded
But regardless
I'm "Tin Man" heartless
No love
If son lookin for love
Get a show on VH1
Nigga hold ya high and die
Or live and duck
My attitude is Virgins
Still don't give a fuck
