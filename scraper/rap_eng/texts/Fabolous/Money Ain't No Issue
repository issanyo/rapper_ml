[Intro: TakBar and DJ Drama]
Yeah, it's DC nigga
You see what we doing in these fucking streets
Pushing the flyest whips, fucking the baddest chicks
Big guns with 30 shot clips, motherfuckers can't see us
All gold AP's, these niggas wearing G-Shocks
We sending G4 pilots to the Wing Stop
Going where they said we wouldn't and doing what they said we couldn't
We come from nothing nigga, let's get this fucking money
I got my money right, call me Rich Homie Dram

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm sipping on patrón nigga
My bitch bad to the bone nigga
She fucked up, I'm fucked up
She like how we gon' get home nigga
I can't smoke that strong nigga
Swear that's word to my PO
That lil chick to expensive for you
I'll take her back like repo
Say, shorty want a pair of red bottoms
Fucked her good then I went and got 'em
Percs got me fucking for a hour
Got a boyfriend, forget about him
I got young niggas that'll get it popping
And all my niggas get a dollar
Started of with an impala
Now all my whips a hundred thousand
Hold up, Now throw your rollies up in the air
And wave that shit to the side nigga
Bad bitches just popping pussy, you dead broke just die nigga
On private jets, we fly nigga
Sipping lean, we high nigga
Stand tall, feet five nigga
They riding for ya, they die with ya
Say foreign whips my fucking problem
Got a couple, don't fucking drive them
My homies whip them like fucking molly
Mo' money mo' fucking problems
A Wraith coming, I take that
I'm everywhere that that cake at
Them hoes stunted, this the the payback
I'm in a Rolls-Royce screaming out Maybach

[Chorus: Future]
Money ain't no issue
I'm on them mollies and prescription
Lean inside my cup I beat that pussy till she miss me
Fuck nigga die slow, I don't give a fuck if he come up missing
Any nigga gettin' money I salute ya, I salute ya

[Verse 2: Future]
Young nigga in a beemer coupé with a lot of money and a lot of booze
Young nigga getting plenty money I'm turnt up than Tom Cruise
Mollies all in my cup nigga, screwed up I ain't slowing down
AP I'm trigger happy nigga, young niggas at Atlanta Zoo
Shootin the A up out the chamber nigga [?]
Bad bitch from Beverly hills, I'ma fuck her good on TMZ
Quarter mill for the AP, Quarter mill for Lambo
Quarter mill for a new truck, quarter mil' that's on the counter
Freebandz I'm eating now, rock and roll, no guitar
A lotta drugs and a lotta bitches
I'ma fuck the bitch like a porn star

[Chorus: Future]
Money ain't no issue
I'm on them mollies and prescription
Lean inside my cup I beat that pussy till she miss me
Fuck nigga die slow, I don't give a fuck if he come up missing
Any nigga gettin' money I salute ya, I salute ya

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I'm just tryna chill but niggas really really want to make me talk reckless
Have these niggas on your neck, you don't really really want to talk necklace
Heard you got L's in the hood you don't really really want to talk Lexus
We got it right now man you thing niggas really want to talk Nexus
Fuck the nigga like his bitch say if she with me in a 6 trey
She ride the stick every which way while shit play from the mixtape
She say shit go hard, she say shit go hard, shorty sound like Big Sean (Swerve)
Bitch keep saying "Oh God" (Oh God)
I done fucked around and got used to money
Fuck game I just use the money
All the suckers get is middle fingers
And the bum bitches get deuces from me
So if you getting money, I salute you I'm saluting
And if you getting mad I rebuke you, Final Solution
Niggas like y'all find excuses
Niggas like us rock exclusives
I come through, beat them streets up cause my whip game so abusive nigga
This that getting money music nigga
When they play it all the winners gon' lose it nigga

[Chorus: Future]
Money ain't no issue
I'm on them mollies and prescription
Lean inside my cup I beat that pussy till she miss me
Fuck nigga die slow, I don't give a fuck if he come up missing
Any nigga gettin' money I salute ya, I salute ya
