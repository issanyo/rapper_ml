[Hook: French Montana]
Made it from these corners, we already won
It ain't where you at, nigga, it's where you from
I'd rather pawn my chain 'fore I sell my gun
Talking 'bout the shit we already done
All about it (yeah) I know all about it
All about it (yeah, yeah) I know all about it
All about it (yeah, yeah yeah) all about it
All about it (yeah, oooh) I know all about it

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Riding round the city with a loaded gun (loaded)
If them people grab you, then you know you done (finished)
Get indicted, give a lawyer all your ones (married)
Now, you gotta fight it or go on the run
Re-ing up, bagging up
Weekly profits ain't adding up (nah)
Keep spending the money, you keep swagging up (why?)
You got bad energy, that's why you bad with luck
I don't wanna hear the story about you had it rough (no)
Short money to the plug and he had enough
If he kill your whole family, it's sad as fuck (sad)
But you knew what the deal was
When you grabbed the stuff (Woo!)
Situations, sophistication
Death is waiting, anticipation (coming)
Feel the hate and humiliation (feel that)
Hit your loved ones, affiliation (ah, man)
It's all in time though, we fall, we climb though
Just ease your mind though, but read the sign though (relax)
Light your weed up, sip your wine slow
Kick your feet up, believe me, I know (I know all about it)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
They say one thing, but do the other, I know all about it
Actions speak louder than words, we don't talk about it
I knew we was gon' make it, but they all would doubt it
Them crabs in the barrel hate to see you crawlin' out it
Fuck it though
Keep my head high and my bucket low
Everywhere I go, gotta tuck it though
A baller gonna still get buckets, yo, not chucking tho
I'm just shooting my shot every chance I get
Won't let the fake love romance my shit
Need mine upfront, advance my shit
Or get three in your hat, don't chance that shit
Them sticks crack, not Kit-Kats
We click clack, not chit-chat
No six pack, but a big gat, in the 6, black
But my shit matte, you ain't with that
Stop the mouthing off get my guys involved
Stomp you 'til your shit crack, mazel tov, yeah

[Verse 3: Chinx]
You ain't catching double hommie, that was 2 attempts
Pull up on a bitch, cracking lobster, eating shrimp
Gotta her swimmin' with a [?] that was from her crib
Hoe if you ain't fuckin' with the captain, told her jump ship
I know all about it
Hang a picture of your face make your a target out it
Got some cars and houses
Came in here a 100 strong
Fuck all them pigs, I'll prolly get the number wrong
I know all about it, seen this shit a 100 times
Work jumping on these niggas from the dotted line
Niggas that came out the projects
Smoking this shit like we harvest
Knees down and with my back to the walls
I'ma fuck with my niggas regardless
