(Fabolous)
(hahahaha)
Yeah, I'm a Ghetto Superstar nigga
Most niggas trying to get one chick, right?
I'm trying to get two
You know, two is always better than one, right?
Yeah..

(Verse)
I'm trying to kill two birds with one stone
It's 151's prone, that have you and hun's stoned
Trying the unknown
Doing things I know y'all parents wouldn't con-done
It's you, her and me; eyes too blurred to see
Speech too slurred to G
But you know "Young'n" would love ta
See ya upon each other, feeling on me while tongue'n each other
Wow! it's a wonderful thing
To have a pretty female under each wing
The cake can prob'ly Pollie, both of these Bobby Darlies
That take off their Rockavalis?
My job is narly from getting slobbed on Harley's
Getting smoke from the supplier, robbin' Marley
I hope this ain't tooking wrong
But ma now I wanna see how both of y'all look in thongs

(Chorus)
I got a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by
Said a bad bitch on my left side (oww)
Bad bitch on my right side (okay)
I suggest it be best if we get by

(Verse)
I'm willing to geese 'em if they feeling a threesome
I'm pulling up in the GT before the dealers release them
I ain't with the blazay blah
Cause I hold the record for the most Menage ' Trois and lama taje (?)
I got a bad chick on my left lap
Bad chick on my right lap
Do as I suggest, I confess
At my request they gon' get right
So when you see lipstick on both cheeks
That mean I slip dick in both freaks
They started calling me Two Time Johnny
After repeatedly leaving the club wit two damn mami's
This brother done had 'em
From close friends, the girls all know each other from Adam
I'm always this humble boo, HELL YES!
It's cool for your girlfriend to come through too

(Chorus)

(Verse)
At the most it'll take an hour together
To get these girls from dancing wit each other
In to taking showers together
They know, it's a studio in Fab crib
One of y'all can rock the mic while the other one ad libs
Boo, my government is personal
But I got enough sets of twins to make Doublemint commercials
After trying X, I can only imagine what y'all be trying next
The stacks that I be splurging have girls in the back of the Excursion
Forgetting bout the fact that they was virgins
I don't care who you bringing wit you
Just let her know that I'm poking her while I'm fingering you
I love that thing that you do
And I know about the tongue and nipple
But I ain't know you had a ring in it too
I can tell when they came, cause they start spelling my name
Like F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S (oww)

(Chorus)
