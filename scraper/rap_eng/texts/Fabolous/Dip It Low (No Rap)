Spen Cow, baby

[Verse 1]
Says he wants you, he says he needs you
It's real talk, then why not make him wait for you
If he really wants you, if he really needs you
Really got to have you
Take your time and feel him out
When he's a good boy, I mean a really, really good boy
Why not let him lay with you?
That's when you give it to him good

[Chorus]
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"

[Verse 2]
You're gettin' bold, he's growin' cold
It's just the symptoms of young love growin' old
You think it's time
Then you're thinkin' of leavin', but give it time
It's late at night, he's comin' home
Meet him at the door with nothin' on
Take him by the hand, let him know it's on
If you understand me, ya'll come on

[Break]
All my ladies wind it up if you know just how to move (ooh, ooh)
All my fellas jump behind and show her what you wanna do (show her what you got, buddy)
All my ladies wind it up If you know just how to move (know how to move it on)
All my fellas jump behind and show her what you wanna do (ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
Dip it low, pick it up slow (oh)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh" (I'mma show you how to make him)
Dip it low (ooh), pick it up slow (I'mma show you how to make it)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go (said I'mma show you how to make it)
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"

[Bridge]
We can move if you wanna
We can move if you wanna
We can move if you wanna
We can move

[Chorus]
Dip it low, pick it up slow (slow)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thang (yeah)
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh" (Oh)
Dip it low, pick it up slow (you can)
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"
Dip it low, pick it up slow (oh)
Roll it all around, poke it out (oh) let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh" (oh)
Dip it low, pick it up slow
Roll it all around, poke it out, let your back go
Pop, pop, pop that thang
I'mma show you how to make your man say, "Oh"
