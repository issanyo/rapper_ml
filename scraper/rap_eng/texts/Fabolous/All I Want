[Hook: Trey Songz]
I just want to make you right
In the past, we done both had others
Girl, I'm tired of the lonely nights
I just want to be your lover

Listen, I can't lie, I think I'm fallin' in love
Girl, I just want you, you, you, that's all I want
You, you, listen, I can't lie, I think I'm fallin' in love
Girl, I just want you, you, you, that's all I want
You, you, all I want

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Say my name, say my motherfuckin' name
My sex drive is doin' a fuckin' change
Red rover, red rover, ain't talkin' 'bout no rain
So, why don't you come over and just let me explain?
It's one o'clock in the mornin', still up and I'm yawnin'
Obvious that I'm tired, but I'm late up just dawnin'
On all the things that we been through, all the places we been to
I can't see myself wit' no one else other than you
My appetite continues, you're the main cause of my menu
Feel like I'm at that stage and you headlinin' my venue
You think I play by what I say, but I don't
If I know nothin' else, I know what I want, Trey, tell 'em what I want

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
My advice: make your next move your best move
Yeah, and use your ex-boo as your excuse
I'm moving like a king, yes, I'm just a chess dude
And protecting your queen, now, that's a good chess move
Cause king and queen, that's royalty, all I want is your loyalty
If it's wrong, you'll make it right, all I want is that warranty
Ain't even your birthday, but you could get a couple gifts from me
That black box say 'Chanel' on it, that blue box say 'Tiffany'
Tan box say 'Louboutin', brown box say 'Louis Vuitton'
And you got them Js though, size six in them new LeBrons
You think I play by what I say, but I don't
If I know nothin' else, I know what I want, tell me what you want

[Hook]

[Outro: Fabolous]
Uh, I want is you now, all I want is you now
If you know what you want, let me hear you say, 'Oh'
And if you know what I want, let me hear you say, 'Oh'
You got to use what you got just to get what you want
Them hips give it away, I can see that shit from the front
Want to hold that, feel that, touch that really slow
Up, down, left, right, in, out, really though
Had some bad ones, even had fun all at once
That's temporary, check cemetery, that's dead, you all I want
