[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
Shawty made me feel like the summertime
Feelin' like the summer's mine
Yeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga went
To hang for a hundred grinds, a hundred grinds
Yeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga been
Down for a hundred nights
Yeah, down for a hundred grinds
I been on a mission, I been on a mission
I need you and shawty kissin'
I been on a mission
It ain't too much I can
It ain't too much that I listen, but I listen
Still gettin' paid off this vision
Still gettin' money off the mission
Still came down off a mission

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You are the 4am flex for me
You are the 4am flex for me
You are the 4am flex for me
You are the 4am flex for a nigga
Light the weed and like to go, baby
When I light this blunt inside your show, baby
I'm gettin' high as fuck, I'm high enough, baby
And baby, I wanna get to know you

[Verse: Fabolous]
Yeah...
I be out late tryna get it but you wait up for me
Miss dinner 'cause I'm eatin', tell 'em put a plate up for me
They be comin' sideways, you gon' get that straight up from me
It's always get your weight up not your hate up from me
It came to me from finessin', baby
By they time it get to you, it's just a blessin', baby
They tried to overlook me, underestimate me
Shinin' like a diamond, I guess I been under pressure lately
Make-up off and she still pretty
I'm on my way and I'm still litty
I like her 'cause she needs no practice
Don't wear panties, I like easy access
Know her role like she's an actress
Laid up with your boy, G's in the mattress
4am flexin' on them lonely hoes
Sippin' Bobby Brown, Tenderoni flows
My heart belongs to a Roni
She's my only lover, she's my only love
Yeah, my heart belongs to a Roni
She's my only lover, she's my only love, ha...

[Refrain: Tory Lanez]
Shawty made me feel like the summertime
Feelin' like the summer's mine
Yeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga went
To hang for a hundred grinds, a hundred grinds
Yeah, she don't know the nights that a nigga been
Down for a hundred nights
Yeah, down for a hundred grinds
I been on a mission, I been on a mission
I need you and shawty kissin'
I been on a mission
It ain't too much I can
It ain't too much that I listen, but I listen
Still gettin' paid off this vision
Still gettin' money off the mission
Still came down off a mission

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
You are the 4am flex for me
You are the 4am flex for me
You are the 4am flex for me
You are the 4am flex for a nigga
