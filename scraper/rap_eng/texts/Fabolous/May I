[Intro - Trey Songz]
Track’s so phenominal I’m ’bout to spit venom
I’d like to thank Phenom
Yeah

[Verse 1 - Trey Songz]
You see I’m something like a player
But mamma may I
Get down on my knees
And say a prayer
Cos your body’s a blessing
Yeah I love it I want it I need it
And I ain’t happy til I hit it and get it succeed it
You know i’m hungry as a mother f-cker
Would you feed him
I’m on a bad bitch diet
You niggas should try it
Higher than a pilot
Tryna see how high the sky
Get whoever said the sky is the limit’s on some lie shit
Cos i’m looking down at it
You looking ass backwards
Everything I have is everything that he is lacking
Baby you are so attractive
You the baddest
All I wanna know is can I may I have it

[Hook:]
Mamma may I
Can I bite off a lil piece
You look edible to me
I’d like to have you with my coffee, sugar
Mama can I call you Billie Jean
Cos the girl is not my lover but my love is what she needs
May I
Show you what you missing
May I
Girl I know you different
You got me thinking saying baby may I
May I…

[Verse 2 - Fabolous:]
Now I tried to ask politely
Cos they love when I say nice
But that nice shit don’t excite me
She say pull it she say bite me she say grab it hold it tightly
And so rightly I be tryna tear that mother f-cker up
Give it to you rough still be the smoothest around
Feed you Ciroc til the moon start moving ‘em round
You wanna act like a nun I’ma prove that you down
The nuns be them ones you seen that movie The Town
So may I take a couple steps forward
If the bad bitches had a crew you would rep for it
You could give me top quiz girl I’m prepped for it
When them other chicks stopped baby girl just kept going
Dat’s that Energizer bunny put my face in it I'll be Pooh Bear for you honey
Them niggas are a joke I told her don’t be fucking funny
And the kush clouds got the room looking partly sunny

[Hook:]
Mamma may I
Can I bite off a lil piece
You look edible to me
I’d like to have you with my coffee, sugar
Mama can I call you Billie Jean
Cos the girl is not my lover but my love is what she needs
May I
Show you what you missing
May I
Girl I know you different
You got me thinking saying baby may I
May I…

[Verse 3 - Trey Songz:]
Yeah they say I’m rapping like Wayne, Jay and Kanye
Where’s Amber Rose told them I don’t know they
So mind your fucking business I know Trey does
But I would still hit it shit nigga Kanye shrug
Gotta hit a gaylor but my tux don’t fit me
Told my style is get it Taylor baby do it swiftly
Puerto Rican Rum out in Jamaica feeling tipsy
She know i’m doing well I make a fortune so she tell her friends gypsy
Pockets on catch me if you can come and get me
Bitch this is my moment you can catch me on demand
If you missed me from Japan back to Whiff Street
Any place I wanna go what the fuck
AKA for envelope it’s Trigga ‘n’ that’s the way your woman lick me
Life is but a dream man somebody come and pinch me
I am such a feen this rap shit is so addictive
I ain’t even gotta say why it’s over though may I
May I may I
