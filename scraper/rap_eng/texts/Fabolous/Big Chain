[Intro: N.O.R.E.]
This is
We built them up
We want these artists to be these artists
And then new artists start acting like the hardest
And you get mad
'Cause he's acting like an artist
It's exactly what he is

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
Uh, it's just one of them days you rocked the big chain
Summer time no rain, you rocked the big chain
You just go to the club, you got the big chain
Walked through show love, you got the big chain
When you good in the hood, you got the big chain
Sun dresses is out, you got the big chain
And you hitting the corner, you got the big chain
Yeah you drink with the homies, you got the big chain

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
Momma used to call me Dick Cheney 'cause I never took my chain off
When I got my brain off
Live by my old hood, I drop cocaine off
Nicknamed my chain "Chain Reaction"
'Cause when you see the chain, the chain start to flashin' (yo)
Yeah, everywhere I go this (yo)
Dangerous like unprepared blow fish (yo)
Your charm is whack, it ain't the same B
(Your shit don't shine, this ain't the same piece)
Your jeweler should go to jail for neglect
He froze when he saw what's on my neck
But I got your back, got the connect 'cause, uh

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
Uh, it's just one of them days you rocked the big chain
Summer time no rain, you rocked the big chain
You just go to the club, you got the big chain
Walked through show love, you got the big chain
When you got in the hood, you got the big chain
Sun dresses is out, you got the big chain
And you hitting the corner, you got the big thing
Yeah you drink with the homies, you got the big king

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
A lot of these dudes' jewelers is lazy
Just like they clients, they diamonds fugazi
Raphael of the chain, they got it broke off
Smoke blunts in the front, we have a smoke off (smoke off)
Big chain, big charm since the 90's
From Far Rock to Flatbush in the 90's
Big chains for the grimies
Shots of niggas that live shiny
(Sierra Leone diamonds) you see me alone shining
(Sierra Leone diamonds) away from the crib it's still shining (yeah)

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
It's just one of them days you rocked the big chain
Summer time no rain, you rocked the big chain
You just go to the club, you got the big chain
Walked through show love, you got the big chain
It's just one of them days you rocked the big chain
Summer time no rain, you rocked the big chain
You just go to the club, you got the big chain
Walked through show love, you got the big chain

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Yo, switch names, call me big drip sauce
Leave big stains, wet it like big rain
Shit man, sound like Terrence Howard with a bitch staring
Blame it on the big chain
Cuban with the Jesus piece, Big chain
Put a lot of ice on that, big sprain
How's life? I'm great dog, Big Dane
Call me Daddy when I'm in it, Big Kane
Rope chain with a Nefertiti on it
Gucci link looking like a CD on it
Ask my nigga Pharrell
Pull the cool J's out, and pass you niggas the L's, huh

[Chorus: N.O.R.E.]
It's just one of them days you rocked the big chain
Summer time no rain, you rocked the big chain
You just go to the club, you got the big chain
Walked through show love, you got the big chain
It's just one of them days you rocked the big chain
Summer time no rain, you rocked the big chain
You just go to the club, you got the big chain
Walked through show love, you got the big chain

[Outro: N.O.R.E.]
See you don't rock the big chain everyday
The big chain come out on special occasions, only
Ya figure smell that and just because you don't got a big chain don't mean you don't gotta feel like you ain't got a big chain
B, having a big chain is a feeling
You gon' wake up in the morning and feel good and feel like you got a big chain
Ya feel that
Respect
