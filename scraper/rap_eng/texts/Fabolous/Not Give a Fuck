I'm somethin' like a phenomenon
But still dumpin' whenever the drama's on
Y'all hustlers can't eat fit meals
And it feels somethin' like when it's Ramadan
Hope you chumps been walkin' with armor on
I'm who they dumping 2 Cole Hamels on
Somethin's turnin' this momma on
I love to see rumps in Ferragamo thongs
Bet it look plump when you got pajamas on
Jump in, let's hit the Bahamas ma
And it's crunk whenever I'm on the song
Bumpin' like "Bumb-ba-Bump"
I'm particularly picky
When it come to licky licky
Have 'em slidin' off them Vickies quickly
Under the doo-rag thick three sixty
It's the hypno and sticky icky
I said Okay!

Fly enough, to do better
But pimp enough to not give a fuck
Thug enough, to do better
And gangsta enough to not give a fuck
I'm hustlin' enough, to know better
But ballin' enough to not give a fuck
Old enough, to know better
But young enough to not give a fuck

D-d-d-d-dammit man
I'm in a throwback so old
It'll make your grandma glance
And everybody know, everybody go
So please, call the stretch ambulance
These dudes don't stand a chance
When I pull up like the pamper brand
Doors in the Lambo slants
With a madame from France
With a ass so big
You couldn't hide it in Hammer pants
Who else be in New York
With Miami tans
Got everybody doin' the Street Family dance
I'm sure this hammer can
Make you save that gangsta role for the camera man
It's F-A-B, you preferably
Don't wanna F wit me (Please believe it)
I'm definitely as responsible
For getting the City High as Clef would be (Believe it please)

I'm introduced to your women friends (Hello)
Cause I buy double deuces to rim a Benz
Like they boots made by Timberland
I have to remind, since I got drafted and signed
Ya'll playa's get used to the scrimagin'
Now one of the Jesuses got lemon gems? (Damn)
Know y'all lips get loose like y'all feminine
I prove letting loose with the semi can boost my adrenaline
You never had no use with that limb again
Half my roots is Dominican
Faboloso mi gusto les Benjamins
This dude got the juice of a pimp in him
Turn to stones like Medusa had glimpsed at him
But right now you can lie and gossip too
And later be the guy who the mas run to
And right now you can try to prosecute
But later on you gonna die in the hospital
