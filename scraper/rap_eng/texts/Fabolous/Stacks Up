[Chorus: Pnb Rock]
I got the mag, I just came through
I just flex in a new Jag'
I just hit the mall
I just blew another bag
I can't count it all, I got way too much to add
And it just keep on stackin' up
I got them mad, I just came through
I just flex in a new Jag'
I just hit the mall
I just blew another bag
I can't count it all, I got way too much to ask
And it just keep on stackin' up

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
They keep on actin' up, I just be crackin' up
They keep on reachin' and I just be stackin' up
I be too high for they down talkin'
When I do say that's the round talkin'
I do my numbers and let them keep count
I got keys in my mattress, so fuck your sheep count
Listen, have you ever, ever seen a focus switch
Like you went to sleep broke but you woke up rich
Like you pulled up in foreign to some local shit
And made them niggas go crazy on some Joker shit
I said shout my Harley Quinns, lookin' like Kylie Jenns
We gon' hit the club and light it up, halogens

[Chorus: Pnb Rock]
I got the mag, I just came through
I just flex in a new Jag'
I just hit the mall
I just blew another bag
I can't count it all, I got way too much to ask
And it just keep on stackin' up
I got the mag, I just came through
I just flex in a new Jag'
I just hit the mall
I just blew another bag
I can't count it all, I got way too much to add
And it just keep on stackin' up

[Verse 2: Pnb Rock]
Stack it up like Legos
Spend it all like play doughs
I ain't on the top but I'm on my way though
So all this girls ain't doin' what I say so
I was chasin' the bag
I'm on my way to some cash
So if it ain't bout no money, my niggas they don't even ask
Yeah, you know I'm on my way
Poppin' addies so I stay up
Like a marry jeans
Breeze be supreme
Gucci be so clean
I'm a Louis fiend
Big body, yeah
Chopped out, yeah
Haters they gon' stare
You know I don't care

[Chorus: Pnb Rock]
I got the mag, I just came through
I just flex in a new Jag'
I just hit the mall
I just blew another bag
I can't count it all, I got way too much to add
And it just keep on stackin' up
I got the mag, I just came through
I just flex in a new Jag'
I just hit the mall
I just blew another bag
I can't count it all, I got way too much to add
And it just keep on stackin' up
