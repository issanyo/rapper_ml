You know me I got money
Being broke is not funny

And Follow me cuz I got tree
And I'm higher than mountain
And your body's bada bing
I don't snitch I don't sing
I don't Kanye album ting
I won't tell no one a ting
I'm Boriqua, I'm Coqui
I'm Moreno, I'm low key
I'm just checking out your stee
And I'm hoping you don't drink
This Nuvo got you pink

[Albe]
You know me I'm NYC
So you know I'm rolling deep
Some with you, some with me
We get off and in the jeep
You just have to have a seat
And you have to answer me
How'd you get up in those jeans
And can you stay for like a week
I ain't tricking I ain't cheap
We wake up and then we beat box
Rock you back to sleep, ma
Oh my God you Linda
And you roll a chiba
Damn I think I'll keep ya
Or I think I'll lease ya
See ya, See ya
Older than a beeper
And I am a G, 1
2 Fingers Peace Sign
Bye-Bye, Bye-Bye
We goin, we goin
Fly-by, Fly-by
Call the bartender tell her
I-buy, I-buy, Me
So ven aqui
No ven aqui, Yeah ven aqui
Ven aqui, ven aqui

[Fabolous]
Mira Mira que lo que
What's yo name she say, Monae
Pretty mami from the Bronx
She was raised the J-Lo way
Hey OK, ain't no way
Ballers do not sway your way, offer you to pay your way
Glasses are Moway Rosay
She tell him No Way Jose
Don't care how much, pesos they gave for pay
She won't be on TV chasin Flava Flav
And I dig that bout her though
I'm a nigga bout his dough
It ain't right, then it ain't right
Her nigga is out the door
We giggled about that though
Then I say I'm Locito
We should go to Sofrito
Order us Blue Mojitos
Or Sangria if you want
Afterward we dip and front
Have a talk and grip a blunt
Get hi-igh, hi-igh
We can go
Bye-Bye, Bye-Bye
Back up the I-I
9-9,5-5 Si
So Mira Ven Aqui
I always been a G
I'm so Fly-I, Fly-I
Live like Kennedy
