[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
I be in them foreigns like I got the bonus
I just hit a lick, yeah, I got the bonus
Shawty fuck with me, you just got the bonus
You just got the bonus, squad, ayy

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
I just hit the jackpot
I just hit the jackpot
I, I just hit the jackpot (we did it, we did it)
I just hit the jackpot
I just hit the jackpot
I, I just hit the jackpot
I just hit the jackpot (we did it, we did it)
I just hit the jack

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
Jackpot, jackpot, yeah
Rolls-Royce, that time, yeah
Blackjack, blackjack, woo
Money team, dope team, ooh
I been gettin' paper all day
I ain't seen a hater all day
I been goin' hard, I don't play
If you want the wave, you gon' pay

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Hol' up, fuck how you feel, you can't stay
Take your boujee back to LA
Rolled up, then she hit the J
Splash brother, had to hit your bae
Jackpot, jackpot, damn
Baby got back, goddamn
Mask on, fuck it, mask off
Hard head but the ass soft, woo, hol' up

[Chorus: Red Cafe & Fetty Wap]
I just hit the jackpot
I just hit the jackpot
I, I just hit the jackpot (Zoovier, we did it, we did it)
I just hit the jackpot (1738)

[Verse 4: Fetty Wap]
Ayy, she give extendos out the window, babe
Ayy, you see the wings wherever we go, babe
Ayy, they can't control me, ain't no remote, baby
They pop out and cut a hater, freethrow, baby
Ayy, it's Zoovie, zoovin' like what you mean?
Before he check me, let them bangers squeeze, babe
I hit the season like pound a week, baby
They keep it real, you gon' have to leave
Before your dope bitch take two of these
I brush it off, it ain't nothin' to me, baby
These niggas hard to try and box with me
Baby, ain't no dog fight, ain't no referee (squad)

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
I just hit the jackpot
I just hit the jackpot
I, I just hit the jackpot (we did it, we did it)
I just hit the jackpot

[Verse 5: Fabolous]
Oh, jackpot, jackpot
Lil' baby feel the jewels
Dealer dealt me a good hand
Got me dancin' like Uzi
Shawty think she a baddy
She be bangin' to the Boosie
She be twerkin' to the RiRi
See my lifestyle in 3D
Gon' get it, gon' get it
'Bout to check, I'm all with it
Girl, you got a lil' sauce with ya
I like that, I'm all with it (splash)
Hold up, shawty sex so good that she don't fuck for free, baby
But she gon' bust that thing for me, baby, ooh

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
I just hit the jackpot
I just hit the jackpot
I, I just hit the jackpot (we did it, we did it)
I just hit the jackpot
I just hit the jackpot
I just hit the jackpot
I, I just hit the jackpot (we did it, we did it)
I just hit the jackpot
