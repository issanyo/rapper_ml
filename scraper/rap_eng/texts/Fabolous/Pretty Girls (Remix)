[Chorus: Weensey]
Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke
Ask 'em what do they know, ask 'em can we go
Pretty girls, sunshine in the air
Perfume everywhere, girls are everywhere

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Uh, pretty girl, pretty girl, that the ladies all follow
I know you got a man, but your body, I can borrow
And baby girl a model, I'm callin' later, tomorrow
And we drivin' from VA to DC up in my Gallardo
Make it clap, it's your time at the Apollo
Paper planes, so my brain straight on auto
Shorty's mind right so she study Aristotle
Leonardo DaVinci, you's a perfect Picasso

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Shawty, what you say, I'm looking for a plus size model
Leaving this club, have to have all the bottles
'Cause I can give you, I can give you what you need
Photoshoot with me
Pretty girls, smile so beautiful
From your head to your cuticles
So what you waiting on? You the bad chick they hating on
'Cause you the only one I'm taking home

[Chorus: Weensey]
Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke
Ask 'em what do they know, ask 'em can we go
Pretty girls, sunshine in the air
Perfume everywhere, girls are everywhere

[Verse 2: Wale]
(Ayy, let's move it out, uh)
A lime to a lemon, I got 'em all in it
I like 'em all shades, all races, all figures
Dig it, you know I got a plethora of women
But I'm tryna find a sister with the measurements of Nikki
Yeah, she don't even gotta ask much
She my little dancer, she don't need a FAFSA
Brain so good, messed around and got a bachelor
Call me Tiger Woods, I'll be back for my Masters
The pretty girls make it happen
All the ugly girls, why the hell is y'all clappin'?
Velcro love for the night, no strings
Let me see you Twitter, shorty, I can make you stream
Cool beans, I be out the college
She play her red and white, shorty, lemme see your diamonds
Lemme just remind ya, I cannot help
I gotta pink and green girl, she don't even fly Delta (Wale)

[Chorus: Weensey]
Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke
Ask 'em what do they know, ask 'em can we go
Pretty girls, sunshine in the air
Perfume everywhere, girls are everywhere

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
(Yeah, wassup DC? Uh, love pretty girls, Wale, what it look like? Loso, uh, yeah, nice)
You see I be more fly than B.W.I
To all the pretty girls, just be clubbin' with I
Last night I had so much free bubbly that I
Let one suck me and she caught a D.W.I
Say ah, found out she a swallower
Twitter name, Miss Brain, you might wanna follow her
Met her out in D.C. homecoming, Howard U
Told her I'm the sickest nigga 'round and, "How are you?"
My name Loso in case you didn't know so
They say I'm on some bullshit call it Derrick Rose mode
If you put it that way, okay, I suppose so
We ballin' over here. welcome to the Rose Bowl
Just got the new Penny's, they look rose gold
Like a hooker in the winter, them hoes cold
Pretty girls raise ya hand and let me see ya
Style keep shittin' on 'em, call it flyarrhea, ill

[Chorus: Weensey]
Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke
Ask 'em what do they know, ask 'em can we go
Pretty girls, sunshine in the air
Perfume everywhere, girls are everywhere
