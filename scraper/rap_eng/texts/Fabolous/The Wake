[Verse]
I am logged on to FuckNiggas-dot-com
And I am everything these fuck niggas not, Dram'
Must be some confusion you niggas are not me
I am an illusion really what you can not see
So picture me like a paparazzi
H... dot N, dot I, dot, C
We don't play when we roll, no Yahtzee
And I hate you niggas, no Nazi
But this the Holocaust, rap genocide
Ike Turner, take that, bitchslaps in the ride
My shawty tellin' me "Kill the competition boo"
And I be tellin' her "There is no competition to"
(Nice!) There Is No Competition 2
It's good to wake up look in the mirror
And the only competition's you
And even that nigga ain't seein' me
My reflection have a hard time being me
So that tryin' to do me shit it's time to dead it
I'm what you don't do even if Simon said it
I kill em with the shine, give these black diamonds credit
And my watch is sick but I have no time for medics
Black ice in the Audemars; this is custom order, bruh
First I call a jeweler up; then, I call the coroner
My car is a foriegner, my bitch is from Florida
I killed the pussy last night so now her man is mourning her
Good morning, sir, I good-night niggas
Y'all on Death Row; I Suge Knight niggas
Time to depart, I book flights nigga
Wassup, son? What it look like nigga?
Black dress, black suits, black shades, black boots
Black trucks, black coupes; guns blow, black flutes
Black card, black jewels, black party bag
Black Friday, throw it in a body bag
Black Barbie: that's what I call my black broad
African plug: that's what I call a black cord
Get your sharps, get your flats: that's the black keys
Gettin slick will get you holes in your black tees
Black limos, black town cars, black hearses
Black register books signed in black cursive
Black tears, white tissues out of black purses
That's procedure when I'm sendin' back verses
