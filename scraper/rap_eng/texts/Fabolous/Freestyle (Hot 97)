Feel like I'm big meech
When I be cashing out
Holding my bottles up champagne splashing out
We all got rooms nobody crash the couch
More K's at the crib than a Kardashian house
No Brian Pumper jewels just large links
A lotta ice in em, I'm talkin large drinks
Lets see what the Audemars thinks
My necklace make chicks Nicki Minaj blink
There is no challengers
F what the dodge thinks
I'm ridin in some....
My garage stinks
Coconut Ciroc
Coca loso
Pretty boy swag never coke my nose though
Got your baby mama eatin off Philippe plates
It means the world to her to me it's just a cheap date
Plenty fish in the sea
And I keep bait
You're a broke rollerblader, cheap skate
My g plate say "tune into the game"
Competition killer
Funeral's the name
Listen up son
I'm immune to all the lame
If I fathered your style, put a junior to your name
I searched the whole planet
There's no comp on earth
Sky blue J's look like I stomped a smurf

Life is but a dream
Ain't always what it seem
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream
Raise your glass
Now lets toast to when we didn't have
Hustle plus muscle equals success, I did the math
I see haters in passing yea they round
I be on the way up
They be on the way down
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip Payless
Won't be on Craigslist
Lifestyle's A-list
On my way to vegas
Ipod playlist
Yea, just another page in my success story
I make my worst enemies work the best for me
My only job, persistant and consistent
I go so hard my assistants need assistants
I'm living my hands on, get the feel of it
Life's a bitch you might want to get familiar with
Yea...Yea...I ain't done...I ain't done...Can we keep going?

This the flow that put haters on their deathbed
And make the chicks blow the whistle give me ref head
Somebody call 911 like 'Clef said
Before my mans and them black out - Meth Red
The newspaper said 'young rapper left dead'
The only suspect they have is young funeral
And when you see him, he might be on his goony prowl
So just put em up in the air George Clooney style
Slow motion for me, Soulja Slim Juvenile
Don't shoot move, a dude can't move his bowels
Or catch it like Larry Fitzgerald
Kurt Warner bullets pourin out the fifth barrel
Baby Im'a make it
My shits thorough
Shootin blanks
Yall ?
The competi-
Can't hold me
But first lay in the box
And cross your hands for me
Fan base killer blame your loss of fans on me
I triple what you see's like Ross's mans homie
Dudes get to New York look lost as D'antoni
You pick the place everybody cross the land know me
Keep it real, I can't endorse of stand phonies
Unless we arm wrestle never force my hand homie
These YSL's cost a grand only
My white girl bought that Porsche sedan for me
Sweet, sweet like Georgia peaches
School of hard ... I get brain from gorgeous teachers
Funeral in the house, no mortgage either
Any competition he see, the boy is ethered
I can't feel my face, this that Boston George's reefer
You lie if you say I ain't hotter than August weether
I mean weather, you can't see me I mean ever
Ever ever? Andre 3g
This is me, G
Gucci print G G
Clean ice, neck full of frozen fiji
Been in the game long as Mario Luigi
No Juvenile, Wayne, Turk, or BG
I'm still hot boy
But its not a game jack
You bang right the first time they don't bang back
Dudes can't ball like me they quickly nearing horse
I bring death to em
No hearing loss
Nice
