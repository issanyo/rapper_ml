Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Intro: Fabolous]

[Verse 1]
One day you're gonna break my heart
That's what they told me from the start
But no, no, they don't understand
No matter what they say
It's something I can't just explain
I feel it when you say my name
I don't care nothing 'bout your past
Just what you do to me

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh, I know I need to check myself
Cause if I don't I know I'll have
You thinking that I'm going crazy
But oh, you're doing what you do so well
And baby there's nobody else
And baby you know you amaze me

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you
All I see is you, yeah yeah
Evey time I hear your name
Every time that my phone ring
I'm missing you
I'm missing you

[Verse 2]
Listen
If this is wrong it can't be right
Cause there's no way I'd want a fight
I love, love how you shut it down
Yeah, I like it
I swear that this was meant to be
And I don't care what people think
I pray that if you lie to me, I'll never know it

[Pre-Chorus]
But oh, I know I need to check myself
Cause if I don't I know I'll have
You thinking that I'm going crazy
But oh, you're doing what you do so well
And baby there's nobody else
And baby you know you amaze me

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you
(All I see is you, yeah yeah)
Evey time I hear your name
Every time that my phone ring
I'm missing you
(I'm missing you)

[Bridge]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I love what you do to me, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
And if I'm blind I don't want to see, Oh

[Chorus]
Every time I close my eyes
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you
(All I see is you)
Evey time I hear your name
Every time that my phone ring
I'm missing you
(All I see is you)

Every time I close my eyes
Every time I close my eyes
All I see is you
(All I see is you, yeah)
Evey time I hear your name
Every time that my phone ring
I'm missing you
(I'm missing you)
Yeah-ah
Oh yeah
