[Verse 1 - Freck Billionaire]
I'm gettin money, heres my explanation
The Lambo's milked out, no expiration
And I ain't ask for an estimation
I just pass the cake off, no hesitation
Ya' see I'm nothing like y'all guys
I just do the stuntin'
Y'all niggas fall guys
And everyday I get the Benny washed
It's Deja Vu, like Denny Wash
The budgets too big, Billionaire’ll hurt a label
Play it tight spray the creed on the Purple label
Pave' set me and Jacob got me linked up
The bentley wag' bullet proof, like a Brinks truck
CVL, we dont care what ya homies sell
Rubberbands round' the stacks like a ponytail
I could meet a ho sweeter than Damita Jo
She act conceited, though, her number get deleted, yo
I'm not a musician, but I play an instrument
The raging bull handle any kind of incident
The Black latex D’s can't get the prints
The Flying Spur so fly, I had to get the Bent
Got initials on the door scrappy
Initials on the floormats
I ain't braggin', homeboy, this my format
The 22’s look like they ridin' on four flats
Young octopus, I carry arms

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
I'm gettin' money is my quotation
Family man so I need the Lambo station
Slick talk'll put a chamber into rotation
Directors style I shoot 'em on location
My hoes Haitian, Trini and Croatian
Ass clap louder than a Oprah ovation
Double D's on her chest like Dare Devil
Her shoe game's at a nine hundred a pair level
I'm in P-rada the color of Ri-cotta
Cheese? Please, you can't tell me nada
I don't share keys nor do I give her codes
I set run through records down on River Road
Then I switched up, posted on Palisade
The Denali stay smellin' like Cali grade
A couple Bond Number 9 squirts
Osama Rich--that's the hard-to-find shirt
Your rocks keep to they self? Well mines flirt
They too clean, board of health couldn't find dirt
I'm rich bitch and I'm screamin' it like Ashy Larry
They call me Brinks boy. Maybe it's the cash I carry
Rubber bands pop you gon' need a scrunchee for me
If she a jumpoff, bet the chick bungee for me
I came a long way and I still stroll the avenues
Move in style, Louis V, rollin' travel
Local nigga, you never been to Poland have you?
So you couldn't judge me if you was holding gavels
And I used to get the raw from Bolivia
That was back when Raven Simone was Olivia
I did the take out, meaning that I ran orders
I had the transporters sittin' by the land borders
The Rockefeller make you rather do a manslaughter
They goin' in juniors, comin' home with granddaughters
So homie if you got a weapon, tote it
You can't jump ship niggas won't accept you boat it
When I was doin it for TV I kept it loaded
Cause these hatin' niggas tryna' final episode it
A half a clip in ya hip'll make ya Elvis shake
You'll more than moan when the bones in ya' pelvis break
Bentley drop cost 200 and 12 to take
Red gut, white paint: Red Velvet cake
