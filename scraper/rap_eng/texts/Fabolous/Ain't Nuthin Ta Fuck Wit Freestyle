[Intro: DJ Clue]
Yeah, live from the 718, the World Famous DJ Clue
Desert Storm, that boy Fabolous
Friday Night Freestyles
You know how we get down
Stupid

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo, two things fam I ain't nuthin' ta fuck wit'
My crew ain't playing and we ain't for the fuck shit
I'm ridin' wit whoever that I hop out the truck wit'
Slidin' with the sticks on some slap-in-the-puck shit
No hockey, just riders, no jockey
Chinese food, less beef, more broccoli
My fortune cookie said stay humble, flow cocky
Call the jeweler A$AP, time to go Rocky
My chain glisten, bright enough to change vision
Shortie see I'm everything that these lames isn't
Told you I could take your bitch, you ain't listen
I heard the friend zone feel like you in Bane prison
Fly little joint, her weave just hang different
Bought her that Malaysia, she went plane missin'
I put her in that fast lane no more lane switchin'
Told her keep curvin' them niggas don't change pitches
Benchriders, comin' in the game dissin'
Fame fishin', tryna-get-a-name mission
My team gon rush you niggas, we came blitzin'
My boy got that AK wit' him he came swizzin'
I bang vixens, main chicks and game kicks in
Hit it and fall back on em, game sixin'
Keep them broke bitches away, we ain't fixin'
You chasin' baby? I'm straight, ain't mixin'!
Dusse straight up, cause dues say paid up
It's go time Rugs, fuck who say wait up
You in ATL, then my crew may skate up
Like T.I. flick, handle B.I. quick
All my niggas bring em home, R.B.I. chicks
All you niggas talk to the FBI Quick, rats
Sprinter full of Splinters
I was gettin paper like a printer through the winter
Weather break I might get the Bent or the Aventa-
Dor, more, adventures of a center
Big nigga ballin', big figures callin'
She hooked on me, she a big-dick-a-holic
Tryna stay above water that's just some duck shit
Tryna stash a hundred mil, keep it a buck shit
We stay winnin' baby this ain't no luck shit
Rest of these niggas ain't nothin' to fuck wit

[Outro: DJ Clue]
DJ Clue, Desert Storm
Fabolous, that Street Fam
Oh yeah!
