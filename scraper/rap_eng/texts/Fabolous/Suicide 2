[Intro: DJ Drama]
Ok, it's time
I know y'all thought y'all was doing somethin
Might as well just get it over with
SUICIDE!!!

[Hook: Fabolous]
For all of y'all, know you feeling yourself
Going against me is like killing yourself
It's a, suicide it's a suicide
It's a what? Suicide it's a suicide
It's a what? Suicide it's a suicide
It's a what? Suicide it's a suicide
It's a suicide, It's a suicide

[Verse One: Paul Cain]
For all of y'all I know you feeling yourself
Going against me is like killing yourself
You've seen hot cars, you ain't never wheel 'em yourself
You've seen money, but never took a million yourself
You've seen things stole, you ain't never steal 'em yourself
You've seen drugs sold, you ain't never deal 'em yourself
You've seen men die, you ain't never kill 'em yourself
But you the realist right? Nigga you ain't real wit yourself
What I spit, I don't do it for a deal or for wealth
The fans dig it, when you spit what's real and your felt
Trust and believe that, they know when he raps
It's trill talk, he really lived it if he speak that
The hood favorite, they could all relate
They really saw me walk the pavement, the dope boy that made it
So all the bragging and your tough talk, save it
Spare me the details, I'm not in amazement
Dick, I've seen better done more shit
I really seen cheddar slung raw, I did the things you just saw
Your net worth, shit I made that on one tour
And this is back in '04, what I got to front for?
Nigga that's no lie, no joke, no game
No fabrication, last name must be Cobain
Must be on cocain, cause for you to ride
Along with those stupid guys, against us is suicide

[Verse Two: Freck Billionaire]
If I get bucked, cause a nigga testify
Same nigga might as well swallow pesticide
West Philly Freck, I'm a Street Family member
AKA Torquise Blue Lamby spinner
Yeah I ball with no roof like a stadium
Preferably I been seen with a lady friend
And the hoes know Freck, I'm only out for sex
I cum first like "A" up in the alphabet
When I hit the shop, the niggas seen me spend it all
I make them hating ass niggas wanna end it all
Just face it playa, you ain't got to clout yet
You might as well stick a fork up in a outlet
I got the stacks so high I could barricade
Got the stock on deck like Ameritrade
You hating ass niggas should just share a blade
Suicide music, this is just a serenade

[Verse Three: Fabolous]
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell
Cause I doubt the man upstairs would let you blow a L
Don't make sense walkin in Heaven like "what's goodie?"
Dressed in black, with black Tim's and black hoodies
So, your boy back like I'm revenge or something
Lock yourself in the garage with the engine running
Or you could sky dive with no parachute
Play Russian Roulette with a .9, don't be scared to shoot
Use your chain to strangle yourself
You faggots in the closet, coat hanger yourself
They said "try me", bitch they musta told you wrong
You rather fuck Magic with no Trojan on
Whoever said you got a shot is tryna load you wrong
I'm a battlefield that you don't send a soldier on
Word to mama, they call my flow Osama
Your future look as bright as a suicide bomber
My co-defendants names are DJ Drama
Kobe, Cain, Mr. 10-Digits-and-3-comas
And my nigga Rojo, respect my congloma'
Sleep is the cousin of death, and y'all got on pajamas
Nigga you gon sow just like you reap
The old folks'll say "you look just like you sleep"
No TLC, I just like to creep
The black box in the plane look just like my jeep
Yeah, I be where the crash at
My Twitter location is "Where The Cash At"
Niggas get camera shy when you flash that
Stop recycling rhymes and just trash that

[Hook]
