Peaches and cream

[Fabolous]
Ma
I can't get enough
I'm a fiend for peaches
I done freaked everywhere from
Limousines to beaches
The kids well known by
Deans and teachers
It's that player who even
Scored in between the bleachers
Chicks used to be
Seam and speechless
Now they talk because the
X-5 got so many
Screens and features
Thats why I threw marines
On each-trice
Look its the F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S

[112]
Let me tell you
What I wanna do
Let me show you
That I'm feelin you
Wanna sex wanna
Ride with you you
Wanna kiss wanna
Put my lips all over you
Can't get enough of you
Always taken of you
So sweet so very wet
So good girl
You make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout
Peaches and cream

[Hook]
[112]
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know
That I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my
Bentley limousine
It's even better
When it's with ice-cream
Know what I mean

[Repeat Hook]

[112]
I never thought that
I would be so addicted
To you on top underneath
On the side of you
Better yet baby
Inside of you
Love the way
You just flowing down and
I can feel it all around
In the front in the back
Of you oh
I love the taste of you
Girl you know
What I'm talkin' 'bout

[Repeat Hook twice]

Yeah oh yeah yeah
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S

[Fabolous]
My nigga Mase gonna
Bust through those doces
Few mo roses
Meet me in room uno doce
You know mo say
It's even better
When it's with ice-cream
Know what I mean
I ain't with the ordinary
I get the strawberries
Straight to the hole
With my sh*t like Marbury
Never down with a quickie
And it ain't no secret
I'm trying to strip you
Down to your vickie
Some girls be tweakin'
Believing I'm lookin'
For a freak in the morning
A freak in the evening
That'll do more than kiss me
On my cheek
When I'm leavin'
Can change a way a man
Speakin' and breathin'
Sugar. I know you love
Some cream in your coffee
I'll give it to you till
You scream get him off me
Ya pants is up now
A minute ago
You was shaking like
You was doing that
Dance from Uptown
Oh

[Repeat Hook twice]
