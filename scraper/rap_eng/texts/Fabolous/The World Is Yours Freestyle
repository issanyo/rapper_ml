[Intro: (Pete Rock sample) & Fabolous]
(Whose world is this?)
The world is yours, the world is yours
(It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?)
Yo the world is yours, the world is yours
(It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?)

[Verse]
Ayo I can't stop til I kill 'em now that's dedication
You slow niggas get .38 special education
You ask who the sickest and in need of medication
They ain't gotta think too hard, ain't no need for meditation
It's me and my federation, flowing with steady pacing
I'm a nightmare on Fridays, call me Freddy Jason
I'm ill with it, sometimes I lay in bed like patients
But can't sleep at night, the thoughts in my head are racing
'Bout niggas having runs and forget the Feds are patient
They jog behind niggas when they out here cheddar chasin'
Wait til your legs are tired, flip a regular buyer
Crack 'em and watch you scramble like eggs in frying pans
The Testarossas turn to testifying, man
The don't knows start identifying, damn
That's why I bullshit with them generic hoes
Hit it and show no emotion like I'm Derrick Rose
Bend 'em over put 'em in the Walls of Jerichos
But I need queens not Hillside or Merrick hoes
Nigga every lyrics goes, I don't take a bar off
My chain hang like big tits with the bra off
Don't push buttons except for when I turn the car off
But homie in the Yankee let the AR off
Yeah, I call him A-Rod nigga
If I point he start shooting like we play guard nigga
And that's the reason that I'm chilling Big Willie style
Check the chip tooth smile and my whips roof now
Got the stars in it and a honey with talent
The Wraith black like homeboy from Money and Violence
I keep ballin' but never falling six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me
(Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me
(Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

[Outro]
(Whose world is this?
Its mine, it's mine, it's mine
Who's world is this?)
Aye every morning I tell my son he gon' be a king
And every night I tell em the world is yours
I want him to believe that shit
