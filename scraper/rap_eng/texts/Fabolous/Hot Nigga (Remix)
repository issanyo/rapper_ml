[Intro: Fabolous]
Niggas got me on my Brooklyn shit, aye, what I told 'em? I said
Bein' hot get you the MVP, stayin' hot get you the hall of fame
It's Loso, Brooklyn forever, Shmurda, what up, son?
Brooklyn, what up, son? Huh?

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yo, I hit my shmoney dance when I caught the lick
I hit my shmoney dance when I caught ya chick
I Bobby Shmurdered that when she came 'round
Threw the hat up in the air, it never came down
And I just caught that body like a week ago
Real quick, click clack, get to freakin', hoe
She want some hot nigga chillin' out in Mykonos
Or thot niggas all summer, every weekend, hoe
I ain't no killer but don't push me, yo
I had 'em killers in yo bushes, yo
Them trick niggas splurge on the pussy, yo
You give me one day, I'll Purge on that pussy, yo
You ain't seen these kicks since like the fifth grade
Back when Bo Jackson and Ken Griffey played
On my 90s flow, nigga, Young OG shit
On my GSC, Meet the Family shit

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Can't hold you forever, you gon' get a date
Tell 'em free my nigga Critter Mate
Hold ya head to all my niggas in the state
D-Block, GS9, nigga, get it straight
Got the semi and fully on me
Gloves, mask and a hoodie on me
'Case we need to steal a V, I got the pully on me
I know you shocked, right? They got me on bully, homie
It's fake love 'cause they really hatin'
For my downfall, they really waitin'
Hundred yardies, a hundred Haitians
I'm a hot nigga by affiliation

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Look, fresh up out the county, I done did a lil bid
Let the popos run up on me, I won't tell them coppers shit
All this money in my pocket, you might think I sold a brick
I got four hoes and some Hen', some low pros on my Benz
And if I catch that nigga slippin', I'ma shut him down
Let my homies separate his body, call that Seven Pounds, better cool out
I'm nice with the hands, you keep talkin' that shit, I'll knock you out
A nigga be pickin' you up off of the ground for thinkin' you 2Pac
And shawty give me neck 'til I pass out
And she just gettin' checks 'cause her ass out
Makin' money, gotta be the fast route
Bitch, if you ain't fuckin', better get yo ass out

[Verse 4: Rowdy Rebel]
Pow, pow, that chopper make him Diddy Bop
Free Slice Billy, let my billy rock
And free A-billi, let A-billi out
When Flex drop a bomb on us, watch the city rock
Made Diddy shmoney dance right on Biggie block
Make him bring a hundred bands and the city out
When French pull up in that brand new Yacht
Watch me slide off with ya thot 'cause I'm worth about a milli now
Niggas think 'cause we dancin' 'round, niggas won't get shot
That's Bobby Shmurda, not Bobby Brown, known to pop up on the block
These pussy niggas better calm it down, get the same drop from that thot
And these fuck niggas don't come around 'cause they know they gon' get shot

[Verse 5: Busta Rhymes]
Fuck around and get ya shit popped
Like hangin' out too long on 91st and Winthrop
See, you the type to probably get got
See, this where all the fuckery nigga shit stop
Shawty climb this money mountain to the tip-top (get it)
Throw a hundred fifty on my wrist (watch)
Stayed with the heat, they call me Chris Bosh
Angry 'cause niggas see me leavin' the bitch block
Shout my nigga Web, shout my nigga Luger
Free my nigga Smiles, free my nigga Scooter
I suggest you probably pray to Buddha
Conglomerate and GS9 niggas full of shooters

[Verse 6: Yo Gotti]
Let's talk about a hot nigga
My dogs'll sit and rot, nigga
Fuck the judge, we never cop, nigga
Who the first to bring that Lambo on the block, nigga?
Poppin' Aces in the studio with Bobby 'nem
Before all the labels started callin' him
'Cause bitch, I understand him 'cause I'm one of them
So know you hatin' on me if you hatin' on 'em
Memphis shooters, that's who we are
Made a million out a glass jar
Cocaine, I got dope bars
My nigga Snootie just caught a gun charge
Fuck a law, we gon' ride strapped, bitch
We be 'bout that beef, fuck that rap shit
And free my nigga Meek, I'm on my Philly shit
And my New York bitch from Dyckman, she Dominican

[Verse 7: Bobby Shmurda]
Grimy savage, that's who we are
Grimy shooters dressed in G-Star
GS9, I go so hard
But GS for my Gun Squad
And bitch, if it's a problem, we gon' gun brawl
Shots poppin' out the AR
I'm with Trigger, I'm with Rasha, I'm with A-Raw
Broad daylight and we gon' let them thangs bark
Tell them niggas free Meeshie, hoe
Some way, free Breezy, hoe
And tell my niggas Shmurda teamin', hoe
Mitch caught a body about a week ago
Fuck with us and then we tweakin', hoe
Run up on that nigga, get to squeezin', hoe
Everybody catchin' bullet holes
Niggas got me on my bully, yo
I'ma run up, put that gun on him
I'ma run up, go dumb on him
Niggas got me on that young shit
Got me on that go dumb shit

[Outro: Bobby Shmurda]
Got me on that go dumb shit, man
Trap mode in this motherfucker, hotter than a bitch
Ayo, pour up, I need some more drank
