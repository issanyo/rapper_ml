[Fabolous Talkin]
Yeah, ugh...
F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S
Ugh...
Desert Storm
Jimmy...
Okay.... ladies...

[Fabolous]
Ugh, ugh, yo...
You just don't know
All I got is you
You wanna pick up the phone
The only one that call the spot is you
Only one that ever withdraw the knot is you
And walk from spring to fall in the hottest shoe

It's just two-way tagging, dating
Sitting in the Jag
Debating whether to go match or dating
Sometimez relationships get aggravating
Know now it's real
And J know how I feel
Ugh, Cozier... yeah

[Jimmy]
I wanna tell y'all about my ol' lady
Sometimes, I think she's really crazy
She blacks out at the drop of a dime
But she's still my baby
She likes to get into confrontations with me
Testing my patience to see how far she can go
Before I lose my head

Chorus [Jimmy]
Sometimes I love her
Sometimes I love her not
But I ain't lettin' her go cause she's all I got
Although she nags me and complains a lot
I ain't letting her go
No, no, no

[Jimmy]
The next minute she can be sweet as ever
Grinnin' from ear to ear
That's why we're together
What could make her change so fast
It's very confusing

Many times I felt like up and leaving, oh girl
But I'm way too deep in love with her
As crazy as she is
I want her to have my kids

Repeat Chorus

With her
I have grown
With her
Home is home
I would never turn my back on my baby
I can't do that

[Fabolous]
If you heard what the F I did
You woulda left my house on fire like Left-Eye did
I done stuck through the nag and
And pushed from Sedan to the coupe
To the truck, to the wagon

You gotta have faith and some patience
Stop trippin' mama
You get can the safe combination
It's nothing but love, make sure you put nothing above
F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S
Wha?

Repeat Chorus til fade
