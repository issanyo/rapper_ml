We stumble
We fall
We trip
Times like hipsters in the night
Times like hipsters in the night
You drink
We don’t
We love
You won’t
Times like hipsters in the night
Like hipsters in the night
Ahhhhhh

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
In this life don't you ever stress the could haves
Baby, if it should have, it would have
I get a good laugh when people showing up at meal time
And then they disappear at real time
We try to eat like it's thanks giving or something
But I don't like looking like thanks giving to someone
And Cali switching up trynna Aunt Vivian something
Looking for the money like being Frank Levin or something

[Verse 2: Jordan Bratton]
White dust in your system
Green lights in your face
Red blood running down not a trace
Oh yeah, oh yeah

[Pre-Hook: Jordan Bratton]
I've been mislead for way too long
Took this trail like a hundred times
If this life should take over me. The End!
It will be the death of a good man

[Hook: Jordan Bratton]
The time it takes, takes to find your way baby
It will be the death of a good man
More can't you wait to seek revenge on me
It will be the death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to find your way baby
It will be the death of a good man
More can't you wait to seek revenge on me

[Verse 2: Jordan Bratton]
White dust in your system
Satans falling through your system
Paved this path full of gold
Thought it lead to your soul
To your soul, to your soul

[Pre-Hook: Jordan Bratton]
I've been mislead for way too long
Took this trail like a hundred times
If this life should take over me. The End!
It will be the death of a good man

[Hook: Jordan Bratton]
The time it takes, takes to find your way baby
It will be the death of a good man
More can't you wait to seek revenge on me
It will be the death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to find your way baby
It will be the death of a good man
More can't you wait to seek revenge on me

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Its a game full of snakes that'll swallow you whole
The leeches empty pockets then hollow your soul
A gold digger chased behind as you follow your goals
And you only live once but the motto gets old
Then you die
You resurrect as the new guy
You hit new lows, you tryna find yourself a new high
Now you to high
You look down and can't see the ground
You didn't see it coming but you see it now

[Hook: Jordan Bratton]
The time it takes, takes to find your way baby
It will be the death of a good man
More can't you wait to seek revenge on me
It will be the death of a good man
The time it takes, takes to find your way baby
It will be the death of a good man
More can't you wait to seek revenge on me
