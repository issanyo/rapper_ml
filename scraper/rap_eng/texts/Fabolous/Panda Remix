Panda [x6]

[Verse:]
You ain't fam I don't trust you
Niggas will jam up your hustle
Your own man want to crush you, that's a D'Angelo Russell
Set him up, got em
Welven up, got em
Wet em up when they spot em
7up red dot em
I leveled up from the bottom, redded up on the bottom (walk with me nigga)
I leveled up like the volume, Kev what's up what's the problem (talk to me nigga)
It's playoff time for the D Boys, I get love like the Cavs nigga
I went indy on a rap tour, OKC do the math nigga
On the Grizzly like I'm a Spur, in a Maybach I'm a skrr
Talking Hawks cause we really Celtics (selled it)
Talking birds cause we really dealt it
Got the Rockets for the Warriors
Blazing Clips making 40 up
Woulda got you if we wanted you
Pull the heat and blow the Hornets up
In these streets in a foreign joint, a free throw ain't more on point
I know some niggas that'll flatline you, get you robbed like Blac Chyna
The white party in Atlanta, the black party was bananas
Dabbing on em like a Panther (Cam)
Freddy glove on the panda
Krueger sweater on a bear face, bust down from a bare face
Remember me from the staircase, now the loft got a staircase
Now you see how I stepped it up, got it up and then kept it up
Freddy Jason on a Friday, proly shoulda never slept on us
We not the same got to separate us, we ain't never put the weapon up
We authentic y'all replicas, y'all niggas can't rep with us
