Oh, oh, oh

[Diddy:]
I like this right here
Bad Boy
Come on
It was all a dream
Just a story

It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
It was all a dream
{Bad Boy, baby)

[Dream:]
As we proceed (seed)
To give you what you need {need)
Two thousand three (three)
It's time for Dream

All the letters that you sent
They don't bother me at all
And when I'm with my friends
Just feel free to call

And when you keep me up
On the phone at night
You just know that's alright
(Alright)

I'm kinda cool with you stressing me
And I'm kinda cool you won't let me be
And I'm kinda cool that you're up on me constantly

And I ain't mad that you pager me
(Oh)
And I ain't mad that you're chasing me
(Oh)
I don't mind you bugging me
That's okay
That's okay with me

You keep calling me
Bugging me
Tugging on my zipper
But that's okay with me
(Okay with me, baby)
That's okay

You keep pulling up
Showing up
(Oh)
Popping up uninvited
Unexpectedly
But that's okay
Okay, yeah

You see
You don't make me sick
But I'm sick without you
You're infatuated
Not the one too hated

The fact that you won't share me
With anybody else
That's okay with me

I'm kinda cool with you stressing me
(Oh}
And I'm kinda cool you won't let me be
(Oh)
And I'm kinda cool that you're up on me constantly

And I ain't mad that you pager me
(With paging)
And I ain't mad that you're chasing me
(Oh)
I don't mind you bugging me
(You bugging me)
That's okay
That's okay with me

You keep calling me
Bugging me
Tugging on my zipper
But that's okay with me
(Okay with me, baby)
That's okay

You keep pulling up
Showing up
(Oh)
Popping up uninvited
Unexpectedly
But that's okay
Okay, yeah

If your love is just what a girl like me
Is wishing for
Hoping for
Baby, you're the one I adore
At night when I'm home
Loving you
Just keep doing how you doing it
It's all okay with me

[Fabolous:]
You can come if you want to
Call if you want to
Put my pictures up on your wall if you want to
But any other girl
I wouldn't have called back
I show 'em I'm all that
Tell 'em to fall back

Cause I'm always on the find
Always gonna shine
And it's kinda cool that I'm always on your mind
You been bugging me
I feel like you're hugging me
And when you be stressing me
It feel like you blessing me

I ain't mad at ya
Come on to the Empala
And letting the fab catch ya
But don't let dad catch ya
Guy gon' grab at ya
But when you got a playa like me
Why let a butter knife get a stab at ya?

We never have a hard time getting each other
And our friends always say
We be sweating each other
But if it's okay with me and it's okay with you
Then it's okay with we and it's okay to do

[Dream:]
(It's okay with me)
You keep calling me
Bugging me
Tugging on my zipper
But that's okay with me
(It's okay)
It's okay with me
Okay with me

You keep pulling up
(Oh)
Showing up
(Oh)
Popping up uninvited
Unexpectedly
But that's okay
Okay, yeah
(Okay, okay)
That's okay
