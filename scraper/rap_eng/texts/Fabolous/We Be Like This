[Intro: Fabolous]
Getting it on
Brooklyn we back
Ghetto Fab

[Repeat 4X]
Like that I got on, I got on

[Hook: repeat 2X]
From the rocks to the trees
We be like this
From the blocks to the P's
Streets be like this
From the cock to the squeeze
Heat be like this
Ghetto F-A-B
Keep it like this

[Fabolous]
I'm an ordinary gent, in a strawberry Bent
Air Force Ones, check out the Burberry print
It's the kid, who do you fuck with
Ya'll should stop starring, unless Gucci make bullet proof buckets
Street family boys, kisses on they cheek
And why the D.A. and see the whip misses in a week
Ghetto gotta admire, man on it like this
And Prada work, retirement plan on my wrist
Niggas don't like that I got on
It's easier to find Bin Ladden, then the nikes that I got on
I used to love apartments, now I'm laughing in a mini mansion
I feel like I'm in a glove compartment
I'm far from jealous
But you ain't smoking good if what you buy don't look like the ?
I'm the reason your chillin'
It's no problem ridin? up
Puttin' a few of these in your melon
Why I'm breezing and yelling, ghetto

[Hook: repeat 2X]

[Jadakiss]
Ay yo, never get caught holding a gram
Never take a bitch word over your man
Stay close to him
Never let em know where you live
Never let get familiar with your dough or your kids
Put the toast to em
Always stay quiet and humble
But don't be scared to take it to the knife or the gun in a rumble
I could show you how to get your neck broke
Stretch coke, the middle of the ocean on a mean duplex boat
Look here, there is no competitor
See now with the space ship doors, they open up regular
Get it on with the hard plastic
My sixteens had niggas feel like they trippin' off acid
Trust me, I can't see a loss
Know that if you wack me, you can't be a boss
Ryde or die, cry or lie, get your hustle on
Hold the block down, for life, truly yours

[Hook: repeat 2X]

[Fabolous]
Keep it like this
Keep it like this
We be like this
Streets be like this
Heat be like this
Keep it like this
