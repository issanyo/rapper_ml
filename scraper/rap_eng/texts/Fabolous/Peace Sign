[Hook: Jeremih + Red Cafe]
Hey girl
Let me tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fuckin'
Hey girl
Let me tell you a little story 'bout this thing called fuckin'
Lay you on your back
Got your legs in the air like a peace sign
Lay you on your back
Got your legs wide open like a peace sign
We can make it nasty
I know you love to get nasty
I be countin' this money
You can get freaky while I'm rollin' my Cali

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Aye sexy girl, pull your boobs out
Hop up on it and ride, I pull the moves out
I know it's juicy as fuck, I done heard 'bout you
Turn niggas to stalkers, I done heard 'bout you
I'm different though, I'm on a mission though
Shit I might even lick it before I stick it though
Have you bussin' like a chopper, la la la
Used to be mellow when I was off the lala
You taste like a peach, what you told me
And you should get the sweetie pie trophy
If it's sticky I need more than a quickie
Round 1, round 2, I'm strippin' you out them Vickies

Hey girl

I know you love to get nasty
I be countin' this money
You can get freaky while I'm rollin' my Cali

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Chuck a deuce, chuck, chuck, chuck a deuce
Girl you hit it on the head like duck duck goose
Love me some head but bruh sucka-proof
Bust off, now I got the mothafuckin' juice
2pac, I'm holdin' onto 38
I want in, girl that pussy like the pearly gates
Fly ass nigga, I ain't ever nosedive
'Til she put them legs up, 11:05

[Bridge: Jeremih]
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh
Ohhhh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 3: Jeremih]
Fuck you in my Guccis, know I stay G'd up
Heels to the ceiling, keep your legs V'd up
V12, ride it, love it when she speed up
Call me when you need me, know I got that re-up
Drill, drill, drill, leave that pussy beat up
Pill, pill, pill poppin', poppin', we up
We up, feet hot, touch the roof
She give me peace, I lay it down, chuck a deuce

[Outro: Jeremih]
Hey girl
Hey girl
Lay you on your back
Got your legs in the air like a peace sign
Lay you on your back
Got your legs wide open like a peace sign
