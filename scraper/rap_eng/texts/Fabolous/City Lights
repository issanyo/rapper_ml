Sky lines and city lights are all I see as I'm wasting away
I need the city to remind me
There is life out there surviving

If you could see me, I would thank you
‘Cause I can’t see anything you see through
I can't look straight and I can’t believe
That the heaters not a burning just a bad dream
I could _ france, so you think I'm in
I could play it off, as life is playing out my sins
But I come on like a traitor fool?
When all I really want is something real from you
Life keeps on moving even when my heart has stopped
This world keeps spinning
Even when your love has left my heart
Time’s not affected when you decide to just be still
My thoughts are holding me against my will

Sky lines and city lights are all I see as I'm wasting away
You came into my life only to waste it away
Sky lines and city lights are all I see as I'm wasting away
I need the city to remind me
There is life out there surviving

Can you check me? Can I rank you?
Can we stir up an emotion I can break through
On a twelfth floor, in a dark room
There’s no living when you look from my window view
Do it just as is, cause when no one plays
I win from millions so we live inside this crazy space
Do we want more or hate change
Am I wasting all my time wasting all my pain
Life keeps ya moving even when you wanna stop
This world keeps spinning even when you have left my heart
I hear the people move when nothing is moving
I see the city sleep but nothing is soothing me

Sky lines and city lights are all I see as I'm wasting away
You came into my life only to waste it away
Sky lines and city lights are all I see as I'm wasting away
I need the city to remind me
There is life out there surviving

Sometime I look at the sky line
And I don’t know if it’s the light that makes you … dark

[Fabolous]
I'm just happy to be real
In a world that’s mad fake
That can’t stop me, my life got bad breaks
Dreams come true, I finally convinced myself
And still wake up every morning and pinch myself
I’m a role model, she’s centerfold models
And we both ghost but in the royce model
There's ups and downs to my understanding
To be flies, gonna be take-offs and landings
While you doing at least get to see the sky line
The good life contract, where do I sign?
So when I shine, baby you shine
‘Cause life’s a bitch, that you can't two time
I’m so original somebody may copy
My son points at the tv and say papi
This reminds me there’s people behind me
& God to guide me with you beside me

Chorus
