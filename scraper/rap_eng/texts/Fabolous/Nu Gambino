[Intro]
(It was slow dough, then it sped up)
Mark Henry
(It was slow dough, then it sped up)

[Chorus: Fabolous]
If I get that kiss on the cheek
It's rest in peace
Leave yo' body wrapped in the sheets
Go clean my piece
Two come together make one
And if we have a son, he gon' shine like one
Feel me?

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I said pipes on the 'rati like sawed off shotties
Like my pockets knotty and mob like a Gotti
Don't want your thotty that hoe pussy probably
Burn like the deserts of Mojave, Wasabi
Abu Dhabi, summertime in hell
Heard that box hot like summertime in jail
Need a bitch to mob with me, Nu Gambino
Let her meet The Family, give her my bambino
You want the big fish or a damn Nemo
See these New Jacks is just too damn emo
You ain't got cash money brother you couldn't have been Nino
Ain't even G-Money if you ain't got the ten C-notes
My lady friend she knows, my tints three oh
So you can't see her neck in the Benzino, feel me?
Power turn her on, cowards turn her off
Yeah, left her dripping like the shower turning off

[Chorus: Fabolous]
If I get that kiss on the cheek
It's rest in peace
Leave yo' body wrapped in the sheets
Go clean my piece
Two come together make one
And if we have a son, he gon' shine like one
Feel me?

If I get that kiss on the cheek
It's rest in peace
Leave yo' body wrapped in the sheets
Go clean my piece
Two come together make one
And if we have a son, he gon' shine like one
Feel me?

[Bridge: Jazzy]
I'm your nu Gambino
I'm your nu Gambino
I'm your nu Gambino
I'm your nu Gambino

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Me and shorty like Ginger and Nicky
Tell me her man problems then she give me the licky
She say I always make her laugh then take off her Vicky's
One time I hit her from the back, screaming out Ricky (Riiicky)
Ha, she like you so fucking stupid
Then proceeded to fuck me stupid
She say I need a good girl like she the fucking blueprint
How can I fall in love, bitch is probably fucking cupid
Too much time on the road, he wifed a fucking groupie
Treat her like a Bentley, she really a fucking hooptie
She looking at me like, why you can't commit? (what?)
I'm looking at her like you why I can't commit (bitch)
What if Bonnie would have cheated on Clyde? (Clyde..)
Let another nigga beat it on the side (side..)
Is that still your ride or die?
Can you still look him eye to eye?

[Chorus: Fabolous]
If I get that kiss on the cheek
It's rest in peace
Leave yo' body wrapped in the sheets
Go clean my piece
Two come together make one
And if we have a son, he gon' shine like one
Feel me?

If I get that kiss on the cheek
It's rest in peace
Leave yo' body wrapped in the sheets
Go clean my piece
Two come together make one
And if we have a son, he gon' shine like one
Feel me?

[Bridge: Jazzy]
I'm your Nu Gambino
I'm your Nu Gambino
I'm your Nu Gambino
I'm your Nu Gambino

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Mob flicks and chill
Godfather, Goodfella
I start moving in way before the movie end
This the part when they wack the boss
Now come over here and wack a boss
Dinner at Carbone
It's kinda heavy on the carbs though
Veal and escargot
The bill look like a car note
Mafioso, told her call me Mafiloso
When we out on that Amalfi Coast though
My son the prince King Jofi Joflow
(It was slow dough, then it sped up)
Look, we stead mobbing riding with me
You ready Robin? They petty robbing
Taking shots but Cheddar bobbing
We get it popping, really caking we Betty crocking
One eye on the money got to keep on Fetty Wapping
One eye on you snitches
'Cause I know the Feds be watching
Bought my son a Rollie so that boy already watching
Watch him grow into a young Corleone
Young Rollie on, the boy outta here
Young OG gone

[Verse 4: Jazzy]
Wrist this, wrist that
Where your time at?
Click this, click that
Where your nine at?
Pull up and we just might meet ya
Don't know?
Got a nigga that'll teach ya
Let a nigga then try to get low
Hate to break it to him but he gotta go
Claim top ten
Nigga where ya dime at?
Wrist this, wrist that
Where your time at?

[Chorus: Fabolous]
If I get that kiss on the cheek
It's rest in peace
Leave yo' body wrapped in the sheets
Go clean my piece
Two come together make one
And if we have a son, he gon' shine like one
Feel me?

[Bridge: Jazzy]
I'm your Nu Gambino
I'm your Nu Gambino
I'm your Nu Gambino
I'm your Nu Gambino
