Ah, she won't let me have sex with me (She won’t, she won't)
I know you wanna rap with me (I know i know)
Please, don't get with me (please don’t, please don't)
She fucked bout that, when my lean got me crazy
Said she wanna fuck, get on the danm pole
Ain't had a hater, you gon' fuck though

[Verse 1: DJ Mik]
Now they fuckin, them niggas just mad
2009 is where when I got black dreads
She wanna fuck, and now Im making her ass bigger
Kylab saying im lightskinned, but Im a black nigga
I got mo' money now, that nigga just broke as hell
He only drop records, but they dont sell
Uh, i got bigger rhymes than these niggas
Drake like God, man we some bad hitters
