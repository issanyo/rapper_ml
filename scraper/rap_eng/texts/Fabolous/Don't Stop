So Hunter baby
F to the A-B
Okay okay shorty
Okay okay shorty

(Don't stop) okay

Now I just lay back and enjoy the ride
You better stay back when the boy's inside
With the Marvin Gaye track get the moist inside
Tonight the Maybach is the choice of ride
Got a bedroom, with alot of leg room
And all I got to do is put the curtain on the glass
Adjust the seats and put a hurten on your ass
Now thats how you ride

[Chorus: Female Vocals]
Baby don't stop get it get it
Closer boy, I want to feel it
Front back, side to side
Just relax enjoy the ride
Don't stop hit it hit it
Give that thing now if you with it

Okay okay shorty okay okay shorty

[Alfonzo Hunter]
I saw her in the party, moving that sexy body
I see the thong in jeans, move it close to me
We started a slow-motion, I could tell shorty was open
Now I'm caressing her curves, kissing oooh baby neck like furr
(ooh baby) girl whats your name, I'm glad you came
(ooh baby) baby are you alone, can I take you home
(ooh baby) Shorty money ain't nothing, to the bar lets get a little something
She looked me in my eyes and said to my surprise

[Chorus: Female Vocals]
Baby don't stop get it get it
Closer boy, I want to feel it
Front back, side to side
Just relax enjoy the ride
Don't stop hit it hit it
Give that thing now if you with it

Okay okay shorty okay okay shorty

[Alfonzo Hunter]
There we were, middle of the floor
I'm all over that J-Lo
We gon dip, high above
Give me a sip of that ??? punch
Get low, get low, watch yourself don't lose control
Baby(let me be your fantasy)
(are you ready) baby we could get it poppin
(are you ready) girl once we get started, it don't stop
(ooh baby) and I know you got that good love
(are you ready) and baby I want it so much

[Chorus: Female Vocals]
Baby don't stop get it get it
Closer boy, I want to feel it
Front back, side to side
Just relax enjoy the ride
Don't stop hit it hit it
Give that thing if you with it

Okay okay shorty okay okay shorty

Dot though dot though shorty

More like dutch-o's, got yo shorty
See the watch-o watch-o shorty

U think I'm gonna stop if she with her man?
A little bit of convo, get her to the condo
Turn her little boyfriend into a John Doe

[Alfonzo Hunter]
Yo fab these chicks they wanna get buffed
Two big figures in the club with us
Louis 13th, Cristal poppin
Once the bottle is open there ain't no stoppin
(So Hunter) I heard somebody calling my name
Yo Fab, it's a gang of dames
Let me pull around the range and break it down for these lames
