[Hook - Keys]
If only I could see you again
I will make sure that those days never end
If only I could do it all again
Just to have one more chance
I'll never let it go

[Fabolous talking over Hook]
I mean life's not like that though
Sometimes you only get one shot
Most times, yeah

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Don't you hate a could of, would of, should of nigga?
Could of did, would of did, well you should of nigga (nigga)
I am never on the iffy shit
You see her with me, you ain't gotta wonder if he hit
My daddy was a player too, Ken Griffey shit
He said kill these hoes and get the death certificates (haha)
So when I do me, I over do it
In the red Rover sendin bitches over to it
Might use the Caddy, part-time golfer
But act now I'm a limited time offer
And I'm off the, chain like a stray dog
If I want it, I'm a fetch it, I don't play dog (I don't play dog)
I see the game from a sick angle
New York had a chance, the bitch pick Tango
In my case you get one opportunity
Minus convertible, so let's call it drop-tunity, haha

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Get a slice of the pie now, you wait 'til the pizza's cold
Then you sayin what you +Shoulda+ did like Keyshia Cole
+I Should Have Cheated+ (nah), I +Shoulda Let You Go+ (nah)
I just shake 'em off (yeah), Etch A Sketch a ho (haha)
I draw a blank, back to the drawing board
I'm like Michael Jordan if we talkin scorin broads (damn)
To me you got one chance to miss ya shot (yeah)
Better get ya J up (yeah), life is not a layup (nah)
Meanin, sometime they make it hard
Like a straight dude, naked broad get on top of me
Why give an inch if she can take a yard? (woo)
You land on "Chance," take a card, it's Monopoly
I think past "Go" (yeah), 200 on my mental dash though
And my foot is on the gas ho
If opportunity ain't there, make one
They ain't give me a chance, so I had to take one, Los'

[Hook]

[Fabolous talking over Hook]
Niggas be lookin at shit that's right in front of 'em man
They don't even see their chance is right in front of 'em
You know? It's fucked up

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
I look at Obama and I more than glance
I don't just see change, I saw a chance
How many hustlers do you know waitin for a chance?
Some pedal more than Lance in the Tour de France
How many convicts inside waitin for a break?
That's rare, short time, waitin for a steak
How many shooters holdin heat, waitin for a shot?
Fall asleep in the car waitin for a shot
Sniper's in D.C., I know what he see
I'm tryin to put you on to it, Cici
Just ate fried chicken, I took greasy
I told this bitch I'm a Mac/Mack not a P.C. (haha)
I sit niggas down, don't let 'em stand a chance
Only way you squares ride is a ambulance
Kill 'em while you got a chance in a Bronco
Or it comes back in the end, Benny Blanco, yes
