[Intro: Fabolous]
Why they look mad though? (Haha)
They get mad when you get your boo back (word)

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
See I'm a hustler, only boo I wanted was a Bugatti
But if you got one ridin' with you, better keep your boo shottie
'Cause ain't nothin' out here but clout chasers and cheap heels
And they all got a dream they out chasin' like Meek Mill

If they keep it a hunnid, I'm hunnid grandin' out this bitch
Aye, you can't deny it, boo, the vibe is undeniable
It's on some Love & Basketball, Omar and Sanaa with boo
You in denial, boo, that nigga still denyin' you
You thought he was reliable, that nigga just a liar, boo
I love when boo say go and get that D'USSÃ‰
I wake up in the morning, breath smell like pussy
I need that warm water, that Jacuzzi
Not that pool party Biggie threw in Juicy
Way too many niggas splashin' in that
See that ain't even my style, what type of fashion is that?
'Cause yo, you fall in love, couple boo boo's is cool
But I be damned if you got me lookin' boo boo the fool, I got
