Tonight

[Chorus]
I don't know if I love you
Or I just wanna fuck you
Either way you're going down
Tonight,Tonight
I don't know if I love you
Or I just wanna fuck you
Either way you're going down
Tonight,Tonight

[Red Cafe]
Yeah
Daddy want girl 2 go down
Damn I think I love her
Ass so round
Skin so soft and her hair so long
First I go deep then I go long
Call me makaveli I be thuggin on them hoes
Red bottom heals she got blood on her toes
I was like "damn where you from? What's your name?"
You know what I'm reppin got it swinging on the chain
Seven one ocho
We don't do popo
Come to my town you can fuck with me and Loso
It'll go down (Down,Down)
Imma pop the cherry before we hit the telly

[Chorus]
[Fabolous]
Look I don't know how I fell in love so fiddast
Bet I'm gonna kill it from the back
Deadass
Yeah I'm funeral
I am on a killing spree
Bitches can't get in touch
Still feeling me
Always on the iChat I stay on the phone
They be at my neck like when I spray on cologne
Never said I love you

Okay now come on
Don't listen to anything
I stay on patron
Where's that on your own student loan college chick?
You can give me brain when I'm free
Scholarship
If you have me open on the head
Hollow tips
Imma spend a couple bucks
Godamn love sucks
(Nice!)

[Chorus]
Love Come Down

[Chorus]
All the way down (Down)
I can make your love come down (Come Down)
All the way down (Down)
I can make your love
Come down (Come Down)

[Verse 1]
Ha hah

Bob barker bars
Back up in the spot
Like when you park a car
I heard she good
I like chocolate bars
I climb on walls like Peter Parker ma
I'm in the spider
Yeah the Peter Parker car
Gray with the black top
Like sharpie markers are
Hatin on a brother
Go ahead Obama me
