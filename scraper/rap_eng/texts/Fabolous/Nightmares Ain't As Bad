[Verse]
I be having dreams of my niggas winning, every one of them
And nightmares of something happening, and losing one of them
They tell me that it's all in my head, but I look deeper in 'em
My dreams and nightmares have the same people in 'em
I say prayers before I sleep, and I keep them in 'em
Too many wolves in these streets and snakes creeping in 'em
I used to dream about the mansions, now we sleeping in 'em
My worse nightmares is still the Feds sweeping in 'em
When you wake up broke, how does sleep feel right?
Get up out the bed and make your dreams meet real life
You should be a Dream Chaser trying to Meek Mill life
You make money in your sleep, that's when your sheets feel nice
You make money in your sleep, that's the real tooth fairy
And I know the youth hear me, so I speak the truth clearly
Gotta dream my nigga, when you dream, my nigga
Them nightmares ain't as bad as they seem, my nigga
Ain't been getting no rest, and if you wondering why
'Cause I been getting this money, I feel wonderful, why?
Gotta pardon them moneybags that's under my eye
Just left London, Dubai, then had to run to NY
And I'm fly 'til I die, so sometimes the flight scare me
I keep leveling up until the heights scare me
30 bottles in Dream, 'member that night, Mary?
Feezy stopped the music and turned out the lights, scary
All you saw was bottles lighting up and nice jewelry
Reminds me in dark times, keep something bright near me
You pay the cost to be the boss, but the price varies
And I ain't even spitting bars, these is life theories

[Chorus]
Gotta dream, my nigga, when you dream, my nigga
Them nightmares ain't as bad as they seem, my nigga
Just dream, my nigga, 'cause when you dream, my nigga
Them nightmares ain't as bad as they seem, my nigga
Gotta dream, my nigga, when you dream, my nigga
Them nightmares ain't as bad as they seem, my nigga
Just dream, my nigga, 'cause when you dream, my nigga
Them nightmares ain't as bad as they seem, my nigga
