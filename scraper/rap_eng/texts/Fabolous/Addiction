And I'm his running mate Loso, in case you ain't know so

[Verse 1: Ryan Leslie]
You've got fashion and style
I'm lovin' your smile and
The way you get down
I can't see no one else
It's you by yourself, yea
In spite of the crowd
(Baby no one else matters)

Honey, you are all I see
And it could not be no clearer
That I need you here with me

The way that I like to
Have you around
Listen and you will find that
Your heart beats for me
