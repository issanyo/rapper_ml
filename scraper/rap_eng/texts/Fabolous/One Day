(*Fabolous humming to the beat*)

[Verse 1]
It's easy to look at my life and don't see no pain
I remember takin 3, 4 trains to re cocaine
Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain
Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train
Sometimes I ain't see no gain
Cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains
I was lucky I ain't seized or maim
Get shot or stuck up standin at them cee-lo games
But now shit with these skios changed
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain
Be saying "That's nasty," wouldn't give me no brain
Y'all surprised F-A-B-O's sane
In my road to life I done jumped in and outta 3, 4 lanes
I'm still here

My momma used to tell me
"Son, you're gonna make it one day, it'll happen"
Who knew I had what it takes to be famous
And one day I'd be rappin - though
My papa used to ask me "Son, are you prepared?
Cause one day it could happen"
I dreamed about this game, but who would've believed
That one day I'd be trapped in - dough

[Verse 2]
I just want some peace of mind
Niggas will risk havin cuffs on their wrists
For this masterpiece on mine
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined
But on a small island, too far for police to find
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined
I gotta make sure my niece is fine
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time
Some be like "At least you signed"
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime
Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I wish I could go way back when
I could walk thru and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson
Everything was OK back then
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin
I gotta go back through my ol' way packin
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O'Shea Jacksons
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s
And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin
These hoes may crack grins
But I swear to God I won't never take O.J's actions
If I would've let this flow stay packed in
I'd probably be with Nick and 'Rome, spending my whole day shacked in
For now I just roll on those eight Jacksons
'til Clue and Duro brings those gray plaques in
Yeah

[Hook]

One day it'll happen
That one day I'd be rappin
No
One day it could happen
One day I'd be trapped in
No
