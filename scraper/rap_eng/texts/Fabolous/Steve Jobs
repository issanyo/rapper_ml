[Verse 1: Fabolous]
It goes however I want it to
These bitches never say "can’t"
I just call her angel, she look like heaven in pants
Big house, couple rides
Call that shit Neverland Ranch
Tre Pounds, shoot fast, call that shit Kevin Durant
You niggas beneath me
Now go get fucking stomped, son
Know I run this city, I am Brooklyn’s Nucky Thompson
If they make me go in
I’m-a go right away
My fly ass can’t be stopped, no flight delay
Got a crew of bad bitches
Call 'em the Nice Girls
Yo bitches look scary
But she ain't no Spice Girl
It’s 9 AM when you clock in, you’re an office-worker
It’s big Ben's in my pocket, I’m a Roethlisberger
Coconut Cîroc and pineapple, easy order
Now I got this chick showing me what Yeezy taught her
Welcome to the funeral, pay respect
Me and your girl, unibrow, may connect, wait a sec
Let it breathe
{Deep breathing}
I said, "Let it breathe"
{Deep breathing}

[Hook: Fabolous]
It's goes getting more money
It come with more problems
I used to be Mac-ing, but now I’m Steve Job-in’
See, you got two choices
You can stay broke or grind
Life is a bitch, and I’m just tryn-a Oprah mine
Gettin’ more money, it come with more problems
Man, I used to be Mac-ing, but now I’m Steve Job-in' man
Got two choices
You can stay broke or grind
Life is a bitch, and I’m just tryn-a Oprah mine

[Verse 2: Paul Cain]
Always been a squeezer, I’ve been on the hollow niggas
Always been a leader, no Twitter, I don’t follow niggas
Fuck a glass, drink Rosé out the bottle, nigga
I promised to keep it 1,000, you know my motto, nigga
Don’t just talk it, be about it
You talk it, but we about it
We do it, you read about it
Leave 'em, don’t speak about it
We live it, you dream about it
How could you even doubt it?
Couldn’t get a quarter round here
Unless we allowed it
This is our city, our town, our turf
We eatin’ and y’all thirst
Don't shoot back, bomb first
Get 'em gone first
Let 'em fire, arms burst
Regardless of size or status
Stuff 'em in that long hearse
I think I’m Malcolm X, Huey Newton
Marcus Garvey, I’m surrounded by my army
Dare a nigga try and harm me
Fuck what a hater think
How could niggas try to rob me?
If I’m out in Abu Dhabi, Ferraris and Maseratis
Fleets pulling up in Nobus and Ciprianis
Or that F1 race track, good luck tryn-a find me
Wherever I’m at, I’m smoking some Bob Marley
Seven-star hotels, you can see the ocean from the lobby
Riding in the ghost, riding to the coast
Believe the great deal of stress
I’ve been through the most
Changed my whole way of thinking, got a new approach
Fly private if it ain't first class, I’m through with coach
Street Fam for life, this we all owe the 'Los
Whole gang, bottles in the air
I propose a toast
We done seen the world
Partied with emirates
We all come from nothing, always remember that
So you should be thankful every time you spend a stack
For the all classy restaurants we ate dinners at
All the cars, Audemars with the different straps
But always strive for more, never be content with that
No beginner rap, number-one contender, jack
Arnold Schwarzenegger returns, Mr. December's back
