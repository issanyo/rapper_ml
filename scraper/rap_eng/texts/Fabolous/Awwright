[Pre-Hook]
You ain't even know
Every day a so-called friend turn foe, nigga
'Member we was in the yo
Talkin' 'bout how they don't wanna see you blow, nigga
Then you get a little dough
Then a motherfucker start actin' like you owe, nigga
Had to switch up the flow
Now I gotta stay on the grind, but c'mon, nigga

[Hook]
We gon' be awwright, nigga, we gon' be awwright
Nigga, we gon' be awwright, nigga we gon' be awwright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be awwright
Nigga, we gon' be awwright, huh? We gon' be awwright
Nigga, we gon' be awwright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be awwright

[Verse]
Swear there ain't never been a doubt
Now I got everythin' that's out
Hot say every since about '01, '02
Nigga, I ain't never been without
They let me get my first dope bitch
Since then, it ain't never been a drought
Bullshit, I never been about
I'm no angel, big gates, white leather on the couch
So it feel like heaven at the house
Ain't no reverend at the house, but I run it at the crib
Nigga, like you, all you runnin' is your lip
Don't let me catch you, or run into your bitch
I chase you up the road, make you run into a ditch
But 'til that day come, we awwright
Money over here, we awwright
The bitches wit' me, they are nice
The bitches wit' you, they awwright

[Pre-Hook]
You ain't even know
Every day a so-called friend turn foe, nigga
'Member we was in the yo
Talkin' 'bout how they don't wanna see you blow, nigga
Then you get a little dough
Then a motherfucker start actin' like you owe, nigga
Had to switch up the flow
Now I gotta stay on the grind, but c'mon, nigga

[Hook]
We gon' be awwright, nigga, we gon' be awwright
Nigga, we gon' be awwright, nigga we gon' be awwright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be awwright
Nigga, we gon' be awwright, huh? We gon' be awwright
Nigga, we gon' be awwright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be awwright

[Bridge] (x2)
We gon' be awwright, we gon' be awwright
We gon', we gon', we gon' be awwright, we gon' be awwright

[Outro]
Niggas ain't gotta like me, right?
Ain't the first time they've been wrong, right?
I don't like broke niggas neither, right?
Some people just won't get along, right?
