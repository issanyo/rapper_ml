(feat. Fabolous)

(Fabulous:)
I remember when just seein you would have my tremblin
Never new my gizmo would turn into a gremelin
I shouldve let you go, like keyshia cole and lil kim and then
I thought we were gonna get out but somehow we back in the jail again
I used to buy you nice shoes, keep you looking feminine
Nowadays I just wanna give your xxx to timbaland
Yeah to boo, I mean yeah you're cute
But I drop em' fast like a diver with no parachute, baby

(Asia Cruise:)
You and I, toe to toe, eye to eye, go figure
Finding out who lives a lie, how could you point the finger
You're telling me to calm down, my emotions are in it
And I'm so offended cause you played me for the fool
Thick and thin, rain or shine, I had your best interests
Even in the hard times, we had hugs and kisses
Then somewhere along the line you started acting different
I never seen it come and I hope that I protected it

(Hook:)
I could'ntchange it, cause I didn't notice
Could'ntmake it better, if you didn't show it
You used to talk to me, now you just ignore it
Ignoring it is not the thing to do so

(Chorus:)
Let's rewind, take me back to the exact point where I went wrong
Let's rewind, what did I do that was so bad to make you move on
Let's rewind, take me back to the exact point where I went wrong
Let's rewind, rewind, put all this behind, just rewind

Packin up, and movin out it hurts for me to see it
Instead of shapin up, your shippin out, I shoulda new it
I thought that we had history, damn I feel so stupid
What am I to do with all the pain I feel inside
Back and forth, I'm asking why the relationship has ended
Please don't walk away, cause I'm not finished
Lookin for someone to sav?, could you reach the limit?
I never seen it come and I hope that I protected it

(Hook:)
I could'ntchange it, cause I didn't notice
Could'ntmake it better, if you didn't show it
You used to talk to me, now you just ignore it
Ignoring it is not the thing to do so

(Chorus:)
Let's rewind, take me back to the exact point where I went wrong
Let's rewind, what did I do that was so bad to make you move on
Let's rewind, take me back to the exact point where I went wrong
Let's rewind, rewind, put all this behind, just rewind

Wait a minute, let's press pause for a second
Why you acting so reckless, disrespectin?
Ooh, you actin like I expected for us to fall out of love(fall out of love)
Relationships skip let's go back to the beginning
3 minutes up, now were closer to the ending
Let's put this in reverse, we gotta make it work
Let's put the past behind, it's time to press rewind

(Fabulous:)
I said wait up, wait up, bring it back, come rewind
Let's just take it from the time, I think it was summertime
When I walked up from behind. and then there come that line
What's your name, what's your sign?
And you got your giggle on, you said, "boy you need to stop
You got that from the biggie song"
So I always love the clapper, he ain't steer a nigga wrong
Shawty what the biz, baby what it does
I can see what it is, I just want what it was

(Chorus:)
Let's rewind, take me back to the exact point where I went wrong
Let's rewind, what did I do that was so bad to make you move on
Let's rewind, take me back to the exact point where I went wrong
Let's rewind, rewind, put all this behind, just rewind
