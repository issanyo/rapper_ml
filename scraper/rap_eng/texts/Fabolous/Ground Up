[Chorus:  Luis Santiago & Jadakiss]
Now you gotta be careful in my town now (yeah)
You know I'm the man with my crown on (yeah)
My goons pull your skirt and fuck a clown up (yeah)
We built this empire from the ground up (yeah)
Ground up (ground up), ground up (ground up)
Chopper leave a body looking ground up (ground up)
Ground up (ground up), a grounder (grounder)
Chopper leave a body looking ground up (HA-HAAAEEH!)

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Uh, now what?
I got the regulators to mount up
Go ahead and thank us for elevating the town up
That boy 'Kiss is a bastard, you gotta see him
He giving out free caskets and mausoleums
My first tour, I copped work off my per diem
Emotional motherfuckers hurt, that's a EM
At least a quarter mil' for the V, the for-eign
Some niggas that'll kill you for free just off a DM
Damn shame what they did to his body
You know me, I keep a alibi, slid to the party
Mingle with a couple skeezers, dark Caesar, Ducatis
To top it off, all white so they could see that I'm godly
Yeah, crooked niggas get set straight
When you increase the death rate, it's less hate
Mmm, real niggas can relate though
True master of ceremonies, what's the ratio?
Impossible for me to get full off your plate, bro
I ain't tryna make new friends, I'm tryna make dough
And they gon' do what I say so
(Kill kill kill kill kill kill)
That's the Camp Crystal Lake flow

[Chorus: Luis Santiago & Fabolous]
Now you gotta be careful in my town now
You know I'm the man with my crown on
My goons pull your skirt and fuck a clown up
(I only fuck with ground up niggas)
We built this empire from the ground up (word)
Ground up, ground up
Chopper leave a body looking ground up
(You gotta be from the mud with this shit)
Ground up (ground up), a grounder (grounder) (yeah)
Chopper leave a body looking ground up

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Ayo, I built this from the ground up, that's how I found patience
Came up from the mud and that's how you foundation
Don't stop, pop that, that's if you found hatin'
Face down, ass up, that's how you found facin'
No witnesses, that's all that they found, casings
I dipped in Crystal Lake and that's how I found Jason
(Kill kill kill kill kill kill)
That Bentley Bentayga, straight violation
The truck so fire, it came with a Dalmatian
Hit the lights, cock the ladder, then slide down slow
Them niggas don't want no smoke, they better lie down low
These bars are still flaming, never died down flows
And I know some fire hoes that slide down poles, whoa
I'm used to the sirens
I don't jump when I hear shots, I'm used to the firin'
I come from the COD, but got used to the wirin'
I could talk it 'cause I live it, I just use my environment
See these old niggas washed, and I used to admire them
Now they begging for a job but they used to be hirin'
Ain't no, use of retirin' if you still inspirin'
She ain't ground up like Cookie
She can't share my Empire then, nigga

[Chorus: Luis Santiago]
Now you gotta be careful in my town now
You know I'm the man with my crown on
My goons pull your skirt and fuck a clown up
We built this empire from the ground up
Ground up (ground up), ground up (ground up)
Chopper leave a body looking ground up (ground up)
Ground up (ground up), a grounder (grounder)
Chopper leave a body looking ground up (ground up)
