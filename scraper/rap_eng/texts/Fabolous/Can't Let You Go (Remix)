No, no, no, no, no, no, no

Homie, I don't think you know me (No)
And I don't think I know you (No)
But this clip on the 16
You actin' like I can't let them (Shorty!)
I don't think you know me (No)
And I don't think I know you (No)
The way you shakin' that ass (No, no, no)

Now there's nothin' in this world that I can't get ya
I can't sweat ya, but I can't let ya
Don't get carried away, I just met ya
Or you can get carried away on that stretcher
And you respect this gangster
When you lookin' at this big diamonds and the
Necklace, ain't ya?
Checking the 22s on the Lexus ain't ya?
Peepin' at them black air mex's ain't ya?
Friends would say I'm gassin' ya
Cause there ain't enough room in the coupe for more passengers
But while they feedin' and hatin'
We be leanin' and escapin'
Keep these beats circulating, but you mean I be thinking
Shorty's, a little bit too hype
But if a nigga give her anything
It will be the pipe, and it will be alright
Cause you know the kid will be the type
And do it like Lewinsky, beeyatch!

[Hook]
Homie, I don't think you know me (No)
And I don't think I know you (No)
But this clip on the 16
You actin' like I can't let them (Shorty!)
I don't think you know me (No)
And I don't think I know you (No)
But you lookin' so good
And that's just why I can't let them (No)

You will never step out of line and come out your face
Cause you don't want to see these guns come out the waist
It'll be weeks before your neck come out the brace
Months before the verdict come out the case
When I'm there, the hypno come out the case
Hip hop pops wait for me to come out the place
But you know whenever fellas go through
I'm in the platinum and yellow gold too
I'll always get them girls do the kinky things
When they see the size of the pinky ring
It looks like a bracelet on my finger
Wedding ring in my ear
Earrings on my neck, yeah what you expect
Nigga, I'm something like a pimp
Something about the limp
Before something like I'm pimp
Instead I'm something like a pimp
Cause every thirty days I'm pulling up with something with a tint

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And I know something that you don't know
Can't nobody stop my nine
Can't nobody stop my shine
Can't nobody stop my grind
And I know something that you don't know
Can't nobody stop my flow
Can't nobody stop my glow
Can't nobody stop my dough

Uh oh, you might see me in Brooklyn
My heed is homie if you ever see me in Brooklyn
Cause my hat is on the top down when I go back
My bulletproof vest on under the throwback
I don't see no other platinum rappers doing good like me in the hood like me
But keep it in the stat for when they pull the rover
You heard what happened the last time they pull me over?

[Hook]
