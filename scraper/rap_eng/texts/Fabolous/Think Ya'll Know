[Verse 1]
You ain't never seen a nigga this large
Motherfuck the house, the nigga's garage is as big as the projs
I move from city to city like a nigga at large
Smooth as Billy D, but it's Jigga's da bars
Like you really gon' get me
You look hard, but on the inside you softer than a silicon titty
The chilla's wrong with me
You can look at the kid and see just how them Chinchillas gonna fit me
I strut through like I conceal a chrome with me
Pockets bulgin like I got some millions with me
Any bitch that chill or jones with me
End up butt ass naked inside a Villa home with me
I got a ziplock the killer grown with me
A hit of this Bobby 'll let me feel up on Whitney
Justin will cry rivers like he feel I boned Britney
I really don't get me, I really won't get me
YEAH!

[Hook]
I think y'all know by now that I ain't nothin' to be fucked with
I think y'all know by now that I don't care 'bout who you fuck with
I think hoes know by now that I'm that nigga they should bump with
I think y'all know by now it's F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S

[Verse 2]
I'm often asked, HEY, ain't you that guy
There's no one else from head to ankle that fly
Who put slugs point blank through that guy
And there's nothin' that these dudes ain't do that I, can't do at my
Earliest convenience, your girlie ain't been seen since
The feature with Lil' Mo, over 2 million people, I've reached with my little flow
They said sounded like the kid's speech was a little slow (uh huh, uh huh)
Personally I think they was reachin' a little though
But now they callin' just to get a feature so it'll blow
I'm teachin' my little bro
To stay on the grind and away from the leeches and little hoes
I use the Black Star Power on broads
Even devil worshippers gotta bow to the God
I know all you cowards, it's hard
Your career's dead so I send flowers and cards
Without regards, nigga

[Hook]
I think y'all know by now that I ain't nothin' to be fucked with
I think y'all know by now that I don't care 'bout who you fuck with
I think hoes know by now that I'm that nigga they should bump with
I think y'all know by now it's F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S

[Outro]
Uh, uh, nigga
I think they know by now
Who the fuck I be
Uh, yeah, but um
I'm with that S-T-R-E-E-T-F-A-M-I-L-Y
Uh, for all you non-spelling motherfuckers, Street Family
Yeah, uh, Brooklyn
Uh, Fuck up, word to Brooklyn
Ha Ha!
