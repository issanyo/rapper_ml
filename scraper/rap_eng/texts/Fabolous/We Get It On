[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Million dollar deals I'm involved in
Girls come and go them doors is revolving
Baby, you fine like the wine in my cellar
Now I got her wet, can't find a umbrella
Ow, so fly, elevated
Everything Louis Vuitton, Taylor made it
In about a year you look hella good on me
It's our anniversary, Tony Toni Tone, What else?

[Hook: Omarion]
Ayye ayye, Ayye ayye

Ayye ayye, Ayye ayye
Feet all on the couch and now I'm sippin' something

You know, you know, you know, you know

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Bet I can read your mind

All of that bullshit, that he put in your mind
This is a lot of work, meet me in the middle
Make it worth it baby, You know I'm so official
Don't be dealin' with them scrubs tonight (tonight, tonight)
Get with a boss, you need a thug in your life (yo life, yo life)

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Real winners gon' throw the cash on yo ass

Go deep till you feel it
Every night I'mma kill it

You wit the money team, we live in another world

[Hook: Omarion]
