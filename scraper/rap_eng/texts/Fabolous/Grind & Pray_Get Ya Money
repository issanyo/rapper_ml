Grind & Pray

[Verse 1]
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to Lord my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake
I pray to Lord my soul to take
My cup full I'm laid back, I'm bout mine you know that
I'm rag racing, zoom zoom in a rush too get all that
Cross my heart, I die hard, throw your hood in all black
If you real you recognise

[Hook]
All I do is grind and pray, riding through these streets all day
I'm just getting to this money, getting-getting to this money
Getting to this money, getting-getting to this money
All I do is grind and pray, riding through these streets all day
I'm just getting to this money, getting-getting to this money
Getting to this money, getting-getting to this money

Get Ya Money

[Verse 1: August Alsina]
They don't ever see you like I do
First thing when you wake up, before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
'Cause me and you ain't the same, you ain't gotta run no game
Girl, 'cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission, I love your ambition
And I know how it is to hit the block and get the guap
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damn I hope somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody come and try to take it away
'Cause I'm just outchea doing what I gotta do
'Cause all these fucking bills are due and I see all this money to make

[Hook: August Alsina]
So girl, you know that I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Take that money girl, it's yours, spend that money girl, it's yours
You work hard for it, it's yours, work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Single mother in college, working hard for them dollars
Girl, we got something in common, making money with ballers
See you pussy popping at Onyx, keep it clapping at Magic
Got them niggas tricking at Palace, Kimora's making it happen
Girl, I love seeing your back bend, they cashing out and you cash in
They going broke and you working, back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be when income is uncertain, hustling just to make a way
I know you thinking, damn I hope somebody spent some money today
And I pray nobody come and try to take it away
'Cause I'm just outchea doing what I gotta do 'cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money to make

[Hook: August Alsina]
So girl, you know that I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Take that money girl, it's yours, spend that money girl, it's yours
You work hard for it, it's yours, work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
We grind together, we shine together, show the same folks how to double
Two wrongs don't make it right but two strong's make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers, talkin' down on the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win and sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty, stacked up shawty and if I ever need it, she the back up for me
Blacked up fories, his and hers 'cedes, no hoes to the house, just the first lady
So gon' get your money, don't let nobody stop that, even if you gotta pop that (work that body it's yours)
We do it big, an no together we about to do it bigger, my little mama hustle harder than a lot of these niggas

[Hook: August Alsina]
So girl, you know that I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Baby I salute, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
Take that money girl, it's yours, spend that money girl, it's yours
You work hard for it, it's yours, work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you, go and get your money
Go and get your money, go and get your money
