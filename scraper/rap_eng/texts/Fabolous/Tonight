Jahlil Beats, holla at me

[Chorus: Fabolous & Red Cafe]
I don't know if I love ya (yeah)
Or I just wan' fuck ya (yeah)
Either way you goin' down (uh)
Tonight, tonight (what else?)
I, I don't know if I love ya ([?])
Or I just wanna fuck ya (Red Cafe shakedown)
Either way you're goin' down
Tonight, tonight ([?])

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Yeah, daddy wanna girl that go down
Damn, I think I love her, ass so round
Skin so soft and her hair so long
First I go deep, then I go long
Call me Machiavelli, I be thuggin' on them ho's
Red bottom heels, she got blood on her toes
I was like, "Damn, where you from? What's your name?"
You the one I'm reppin', got it swingin' on the chain
Seven-one-ocho, we don't do popo
Come to my town, you can fuck with me and Loso
It'll go down, down, down
I'ma pop a cherry way before we hit the tele'
I was like

[Chorus: Fabolous & Red Cafe]
I don't know if I love ya (yeah)
Or I just wan' fuck ya (yeah)
Either way you goin' down
Tonight, tonight (uh)
I, I don't know if I love ya (uh)
Or I just wanna fuck ya (uh)
Either way you're goin' down (let's go)
Tonight, tonight (let's go)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Look
I don't know how I fell in love so fiddast
Bet I'm gon' kill it from the back: dead ass
Yeah, I'm Funeral, I am on a killin' spree
Bitches can't get in touch, they still feelin' me
Ho is on the iChat, I stay on the phone
They be at my neck like when I spray on cologne
Never said I love ya, okay, now come on
Don't listen to anythin' I stay on patron
Where's that on your own student loan college chick?
You can give me brain when I'm free: scholarship
If you had me open on the head: hollow tip
I'ma spend a couple bucks, goddamn, love sucks
Nice

[Chorus: Fabolous & Red Cafe]
I don't know if I love ya (yeah)
Or I just wan' fuck ya (yeah)
Either way you goin' down (uh)
Tonight, tonight (what else?)
I, I don't know if I love ya (yeah)
Or I just wanna fuck ya (yeah)
Either way you're goin' down
Tonight, tonight (what else?)

[Verse 3: Lore'l]
Yeah
I'ma go down, down, down
If you bossed up, I don't fuck with no clown
H—Holla at a bitch if you wanna break bread
M—My thing bomb, juice box stay wet, I said
I'ma—I'ma go down, down, down
I'ma—I'ma—I'ma go down, down
I'ma—I'ma go down, down, down
M—My thing bomb, juice box stay wet, I said

[Chorus: Fabolous & Red Cafe]
I don't know if I love ya (yeah)
Or I just wan' fuck ya (yeah)
Either way you goin' down (uh)
Tonight, tonight (what else?)
I, I don't know if I love ya (yeah)
Or I just wanna fuck ya (yeah)
Either way you're goin' down
Tonight, tonight (what else?)
