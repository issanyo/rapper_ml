[Chorus: Tory Lanez & Paloma Ford]
Connection, yeah, good sexin', yeah
Finessing your body, good love and good sex for you, shawty
I want you to let it be known that, I'm the only nigga on that
I want you to let it be known
We got that connection, yeah, good sexin', yeah
Finessin' your body, good love and good sex for you, shawty
We got that connection, yeah, good sexin', yeah
You want to teach me a lesson, got my body confessin'
I want you to let it be known that, I'm the only nigga on that
I want you to let it be known
We got that connection, yeah, good sexin', yeah
Finessin' your body, good love and good sex for you, shawty

[Verse 1: Fabolous & Tory Lanez]
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, please go somewhere else
See I'm just a vibe you won't find nowhere else
When you got the total package, why get someone else?
Let's Kim, Keisha, Pam but I want no one else
I want no one else, but you
Said you gotta believe me, when I say it's true
Ayy, I be the Puffy in your videos, dancin' in the back of you
Then take that out, put it back in you, I'm Craig Mackin' you
Whisper flavor in your ear, you my baby, baby
Know I think big but just have faith if you my lady
Bad boy, bad bitch, still a good connection
Tell me where to take it, girl, you give good direction
Slap you on your ass, girl, that's just hood affection
Fuck your ex with all that coulda, woulda, shoula textin'
Tell him you got a new connect, no stopover, do direct
You come over, you collect, got that check, so you correct
I just wanna do you right now, yeah, and I wanna do you right now

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
I want you to let it be known that, I'm the only nigga on that
I want you to let it be known
We got that connection, yeah, good sexin', yeah
Finessin' your body, good love and good sex for you, shawty

[Verse 2: Davo]
I finesse, the connection with no pressure
We know what we want
5 in the morn', driving along
You in a blind spot, losing control
You are the answer
I been calling you
Wasting time when
Nature's calling your name

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
Connection, yeah, good sexin', yeah
Finessin' your body, good love and good sex for you, shawty
I want you to let it be known that, I'm the only nigga on that
I want you to let it be known, we got that connection, yeah
