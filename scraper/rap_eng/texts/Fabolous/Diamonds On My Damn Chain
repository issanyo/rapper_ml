Diamonds on my damn chain
It ain't hard to tell
Diamonds on my damn chain
Diamonds on my damn chain
I'm like ooh daddy, I see you do the damn thang
Got my vote, I'm feelin' your campaign
I like you but I really like your damn chain
Diamonds on my damn chain
Diamonds on my damn chain
It kinda explains the way she be actin'
She liked my necklace so she started relaxin'
Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Yo, you think they like me now, wait until the light hit me
I bet the house somebody girl spend the night with me
They gotta love it, if not, then I guess they haters
This kinda necklace'll turn on the investigators
They ain't got one problem with this
Square face watch look like Sponge Bob on the wrist
One white, one gold, one nice, untold
You can look but don't touch, guns might unload, now
I respect them thugs who get the jackin' on
But we squeeze set every slug that we be packin's long
You boy got the drug money we be stacking on
Lotta carrots, not the one's Bugs Bunny snackin' on
Got 'em, get 'em close and lookin' like I scooped up
The Titanic chain from the bottom of the ocean
I play them diamonds well when I got that jewelery on
They should call me Parot Jeter, maybe Canary Bonds
Diamonds on my damn chain
Diamonds on my damn chain
I'm like ooh daddy, I see you do the damn thang
Got my vote, I'm feelin' your campaign
I like you but I really like your damn chain

Damn, what happened? He's blindin' everybody
Hey ,it must be Jeezy out shinin' everybody
(Yup)
Ready for the show, you can call me the light man
(Diamonds on my damn chain)
You can call me the bright man
See I don't do brightless, I do, AP's
Yeah, I spend G's on all these VV's
Blowin' on chief, yeah, I got it from Harlem
12 carrot pinky ring, shit, I got it from Robert
Step it up a notch, iced out ski mask
Places in the projects to hide my weed stash
Dominican chick, shit, I got her from Fab
Yellow stones in my chain so I call it the cab
Diamonds on my damn chain

Now that's what the fuck I call a chain reaction
Yo, maybe it's them VV's, 'cause they sets Susters'
Sit on the next bus like that show on MTV
The wings on the chain, make a nigga fly like the wings on a plane
When you're sitting in between 'em
They hittin' when you clean 'em, glitenin' when you seen 'em
Beemin' through the tints when I'm sitting in the phenom
Oops, I mean Phantom, my words got tangled man
But this tiger stripe watch, make you bitch a Bangles' fan
We all know Jacob, check the shit he did
We spent more time making the band than Diddy did
You feel my campaign, then drop your old spouse
I'm out in DC, at the white and gold house
(White and gold house)
Wanna convince me love? Secret service
Me with some of that Lewinsky love
She saw the chain, gave me brain, no strain ever since
Now that's what the fuck I call a good chain of events, nigga
Diamonds on my damn chain
