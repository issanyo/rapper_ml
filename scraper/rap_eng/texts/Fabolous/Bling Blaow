[Verse 1: Red cafe]

Why would my 2 door have a top on it
Why would bitch box have a lock on it
Show me where the Brinks at, I'll put the drop on it
Shorty this the D train you could hop on it (Yeah!)

Ride dirty on the freeway, cop guns off of Ebay, ga go DJ!
All my hustlers that miss BI, put your Rollies in the sky, wave em side to side

Ya bitch on mine cuz everythings long
The 6 duece driver keep the MayB warm
The chain with the virgin marys baby charm
