[Jeremih]
(Sighs)
Yea
Go hard, today
(Fabolous) The past is the past, you know
Can't worry about the past cause that was ye-sterday
(Fabulous) It's a new day bro
Ima put it on the line cause it's my time
(Fabulous) My day, gotta do it now
Hey hey hey heey
I gotta stay on my grind cause its my time (hey)
My time (hey), my time (hey)
If your with me let me hear you say, c'mon
My my, my my, (dah dah dah dah dah)
If you're with me let me hear you say
My my, my my, (dah dah dah dah dah)
It's my time
[Fabolous]
Guess what time it is?
My, my, my time
You can check your I phone
Bet it say it's iTime
I don't even need a watch
I don't even see a clock
Soon as a I walk in, it feel like me o'clock (Nice)
Yeah, me a clock every time I check
Niggas don't measure up, and try and blame the Pyrex(Damn)
I'ma do it bigger than a 5 X
Can't ride with an L, so I don't drive Lex
Game so bickery
So full of trickery
Nursery rhyming, hickory-dickory
Blowing that sour, the hood call it pickle-ry
Biggie, Puffy, Busta, victory (Yes)

[Chorus]
[Jeremih]
Go hard today
Can't worry about the past cause that was ye-sterday
I'ma put it on the line cause it's my time
Hey, hey, hey, heey
I gotta stay on my grind cause it's my time (hey)
My time (hey), my time (hey)
If you're with me let me hear you say (come on)
My my, my my, (dah dah dah dah dah)
If your with me let me hear you say
My my, my my, (dah dah dah dah dah)
Oh, it's my time
[Fabolous]
My time is more like fly time
Don't call it gettin dressed, call it in a sky time
If you ain't a pilot, you probably couldn't style it
Unless you was a stewardess, you won't know what to do with this
First I take the time out
Then I put the time in
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing
So I got the Audemar
Flawless diamonds
In other words that's called perfect timing
I feel like I'm favored
I feel like a savior
They clockin my neck, I feel like I'm Flava
I go so hard
Loso god-damn
Street Fi-di-di-di-dam

[Chorus]
[Jeremih]
'09, all mine
It's been a few years now it seem bout time
You know I got committed with it since I been up in the zone
Sign the dotted liiiine now its on
So ya'll better check your wrist piece
Why? Cause its time to make history
Since I been here up on this here street
Howda, howda, howda hell you gon' evict me?
You know I'm here stay, never clockin' out
Big bottles we poppin now
No telling when we stopping now
And I represent the Chic-A-G-O
On the track with F-A-B-O
You know we

[Chorus]
