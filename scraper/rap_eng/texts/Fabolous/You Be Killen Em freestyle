Yea; you already know that we right here in “Poncho's Palace”. “Poncho's Palace” in 1998 was when this took place; even though I had a “Kingdom Come” thy Kingdom Come thou will be done; that's why I went to “The Kingdom Come State Park” and that's why I'm hitten up “The Rotary Park”. I'm goin up to the blue courts in Lynch, Kentucky and Harlan, in Middlesboro, in Pineville, in Toronto, and California; and you see me all over the world, that's why I got 18 blocks in “the Harlan County Men League nobody has my record, except my brother Hunter
