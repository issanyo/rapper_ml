(Verse)

Swagg champ I got da belt
Diamer squares on my Loui belt
Givenchy smell
Dress YSL
Her Louboton shoes
Make the pavement melt
But she low blow
Below the belt
Ace of spade
Bartender dealt
Balling harder than
A Jordan flu game
In play off 12's
20 patches on my polo
Macking bitches like Manolo
Ride around
My side of town
Get hopped on like a Pogo
7 days 7 night
Posing for the photo
Nudies Pocket filled to the
With el poyo loco
Cazel frames
Can't see the room
Fresh to death
Meet your doom
Or the competition either
Really Gonna need a zoom
Or a broom
Waste'em  like a fume
Throw'em in a tomb
Leave  No contenders in the room
Cuz I'm Taken all these lil niggas out
Like a mother's womb

(Fabolous)  [Hook]
Swag champ I got the belt
Swag champ I got the belt
When it's done come talk to me
Youâ€™ll see I got the B
B is for them big boys with the grown money
And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend their own money
