[Intro]
Renegade
Chea chea!

[Chorus: Future (Fabolous)]
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up (stand up)
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up
Heard you caught them bodies, and you kept it silent
Get more money than a nigga graduating college (turn up)
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up (stand up)
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up
Put your hands up in the air, if you never fold
Death before dishonor, yeah we sticking to the code

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, them people ran up on me
Asking me do I know something
Looked them in they eyes and said, "If I knew something
I wouldn't know nothing" (facts)
Heard a lot about me
You ain't never heard that I told nothing (facts)
If I'm hungry I go hunting, I ain't doing no Go Fund-ing
In the afties at four sumthin' (lit) drink up, smoke sumthin' (lit)
Big boys, no youngins (no)
Run it up, no Runyon (no)
Big rings, no Funyuns (no)
Lamb chops with no onions
And a bad bitch that knows money
She so cold, have your nose running (ha!)
Lost friends when I found stacks (yeah)
Lost it all and then bounce back (yeah)
Only counting on my niggas
Any other time I count stacks
But money don't make real niggas, real niggas make money
Money come and go, real, you can't take from me

[Chorus: Future (Fabolous)]
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up (stand up)
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up
Heard you caught them bodies and you kept it silent
Get more money than a nigga graduating college (turn up)
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up (stand up)
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up
Put your hands up in the air if you never fold
Death before dishonor, yeah we sticking to the code

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yeah, HA-HAAAEEH!! Uhh
Lips sealed, I can do sign language and order a key
What I look like being thirsty, when water is free?
I ain't bring them people to you, you brought them people to me
Still I never said a word, I just knocked off every bird
All them bundles on the benches
On the front line in the trenches
All them Bentleys, all them Benzes
Shit you was doing was senseless
On the road, we was caking
The code, you was breaking
Get exposed when you faking
Let you tell it, I'm just hating
Not the case, I do the safe (yeah)
You rather do the mall first
Lord forbid they ever pick you up
Who you gon' call first? (who?)
Yeah, you know how I'm getting down (you know)
Nah, I hold it on the strength, I don't know 'bout sitting down
All my, what, stand up, what

[Chorus: Future (Fabolous)]
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up (stand up)
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up
Heard you caught them bodies and you kept it silent
Get more money than a nigga graduating college (turn up)
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up (stand up)
Real niggas stand up (stand up) real niggas stand up
Put your hands up in the air if you never fold
Death before dishonor, yeah we sticking to the code
