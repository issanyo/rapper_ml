Verse 1:
Do, Do you got a first aid kit handy?
Do, Do you know how to patch up a wound?
Tell me
Are-are-are-are you?
Are you patient

Cause I might need some time to clear the hole in my heart and I

[Fabolous Verse 2:]
Do do you know that this is what I do
I'm so good at what I do
You can say it but I do
And the only way I manage to walk away with damage is when they lick me till it hurts and I call that brain damage, baby

[Danity Kane:]
I've tried every remedy
And nothing seems to work for me

Baby, (baby)
This situation's driving me crazy
And I really wanna be your lady
But the one before you left me so

Chorus:
Damaged, damaged
Damaged, damaged

That my heart is
Damaged, damaged
So damaged (so damaged)
And you can blame the one before
So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it?
(Baby, I gotta know)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it?
(What you are gonna do, baby?)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it?
(Baby, I gotta know)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it?
(What you are gonna do?)

My heart is missing some pieces
I need this puzzle put together again

That my heart is
Damaged, damaged
So damaged (so damaged)

Post-chorus:
So how you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (it's that type of pain)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it(this feels deep inside)
How you gonna fix it, fix it, fix it (it's that type of pain, makes you pray, makes you cry)
But it's gonna be allright one day, it twists your passed
My heart is damaged, damaged, damaged
(sometimes you have to go through the pain)
