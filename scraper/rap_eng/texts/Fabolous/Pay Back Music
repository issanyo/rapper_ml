{Intro}
You know it's people who wanna see you fail
And I owe those people
Ima pay em back with success
Y'all niggas take cash or credit?
Yeah

{Fabolous Verse}
Having nothing was the worst, now it's the best of everything
They used to tell us "no", now it's yes to everything
And I get high on the low just to level things
The worst I ever looked is probably the best you ever seen
Yeah, so fresh and forever clean
Produce section style, being fresh is everything
Now sit yo ass down girl, rest that heavy thing
Gimme that sloppy head and make a mess of everything
If they don't see that I'm a winner then it's their loss
I say "fuck niggas" and you won't hear pause
We work hard all day over here boss
So every night we go and ball, no hair loss
From the bottom but we end up being top notch
Thinking out the box while everybody Hop Scotch

{Hook}
Everybody knows, how the story goes
Friends turn into foes, I seen it all before
I guess I'll take the blame, but you and me ain't the same
For what it's worth, nigga really can't complain

{Freck Billionaire Verse}
Payback motherfucker
This the Homecoming King fresh off of paycation
Nigga from Penn State fresh outta the state pen
Thanks for the fan mail too

Paybacks a motherfucker, I would hate yo be ya
I'm back to lay it flat like a casadia
Crocodile Hermes kick collector's item
Fugitive outta state, they had to expidite him
I'm back to put the game on Ramadan
Like grated cheese, a six deuce parmasean
Compared to other cat, do Phiily freck get paid less?
Absolutely negative like my AIDS test
I'm getting chauff'd, I'm in the back on Alisha
Tell the driver go long like the Packers receiver
I still got the most hoes, it's affirmative
Every bars hotter than a furnace is
You heard Freck fuckin' with the chick, now he want her
He search for 'em t then he cuff 'em, he's a bounty hunter
They make the ugly face when he raps
I'm back on that shit like a relapse
