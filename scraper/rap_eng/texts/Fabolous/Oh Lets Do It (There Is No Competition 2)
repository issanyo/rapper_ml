Rest in Peace Niggas
God Bless You

I'mma kill 'em dead
Come and get the bodies up
Bitches tryin to kick it
Like they just took karate up
They talkin some Christmas shit
Saying what the fuck they want
Need to call the next nigga
Who care bout what the fuck they want

Hung up on that ho bra
Save that talk for Oprah
When I spit I kill shit
Should have been a cobra
Hit you with that sober
Call that shit the come down
Call me Young Funeral
AKA Cemetery Nigga
AKA I bury niggas
My verse go first like it ride in a hearse
You jerks get merked when I put in work
RIP pigs put on shirts
All you niggas get put in dirt
Any nigga ever step foot on earth
Get laid down like football turf
Face down blue niggas look like Smurfs

YEAH
OH lets do it
OH lets do it
OH lets do it
YEAH
Get embalming fluid
These niggas blew it
Time for some new shit

I'm just holding my nuts
Like you rolling, whats up
Girl these pall-bearer niggas
Are just holding, you up
Tell them they can find a hole and go lay they ass in it
Or sip a vanilla shake with broken glass in it
Hop up in this two door
You know I black on black mine
I bought this to kill niggas
That's that black on black crime
You ain't seein my watch
That's that black on black time
Black rocks, black gold
That's that black on black shine

Too much sour Diesel got the homey moving slo-mo
9 been on me bitch, way longer than Ro-mo
Catch yo ass in New York City why you here for Promo
You know that your ass fucked, pause No-homo

Ya'll are just wavey niggas, this is a tsunami here
Ya'll are Abercrombie gear, this is black Domier
First 48 flow, I jus' caught a homi' here
There Is No Competition 2
