Write another song for the money
My shawty say
Write another song for the money
You know you need
Money in the bank to keep her
You know you need
Money in the bank to keep her
My shawty say
Write another song for the money
Hey, hey, my shawty say
Write another song for the money
You know you need
Money in the bank to keep her
She said you know you need
Money in the bank to keep her

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Ugh, who the hell said they was cheaper to keep
Cause if you ain't getting money when you call you get the beep
She can't pick up the phone you broke ass she leave a message
And my guess is if she never call, well you get the message
You like what, you can't call nobody
I've been tryin' to find you like Waldo, shawty
She said she bout her paper if its there she gon get it
And when the money gone she gon' be the fuck gone wit it (hey)
I mean come on, she like Luis Vuitton
Yorkie in the speedy bag that she named Milan
Hair stay did, like she live in a salon
Her and money go hand to hand, yeah like a baton
I swear on a stack of Holy Bibles and Qurans
We could be the dream team baby, Kobe and LeBron
Only if you gold I never do the bronze
Cause if you could have Beyonc√©, would you take Solange

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
I'm in a tricky little mood, I trick these little dudes
I tell them that I love them but I never really do
See I like pretty shoes, I like pretty minks
I like sightseein' the pyramids and the Sphinx
He cop Italian pieces, so I do the fist pump
And I can only push it, if the trunk is in the front
If the trunk is in the back, then you gotta take it back
You can him me on the jet, iChat on the Mac
Cause I am who I am, Nicki M muthafucka
If she say she not a fan, she a lyin' muthafucka
Always shoppin' in Paris, so I speak a little French
Oui, oui Raggedy, time for you to hit the bench
Indecisive, so I always got to pick two
I guess that's why I've got the Yorkie, and the Shitzu
I told Fab, get that Michael Knight Kitt coupe
Before I put this pussy, on your chipped tooth

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I hate to see her poutin', she wants some Louboutin
I say how many pairs, she say who's countin'?
Money ain't everything, with her it's the only thing
You don't treat her like a queen, you gon' be a lonely king
Her daddy must have spoiled her, ain't no expiration date
Fuck dinner and a movie, she wants a vacation date
Fly her out to London, cruise to the Bahamas
Presidential suite, we check in as the Obamas
Take for instance, Nicki, when she shops, she picky
Fucks up fifty G's fast, then calls it a quicky
I only deal with ten cents, my dick game is intense
Bent that Barbie over, she ain't seen Ken since
These niggas be feelin' her, affordin' her's another thing
She was married once before, lookin' for another ring
So I call her Peyton Manning, that's amongst the other things
She say she like my flow, I think she love the scene
