[Verse 1: Jazzy]
Remember all the days
When lovin' you was easy
You used to hold and squeeze me
All through the night
I wanna make you feel
Like you never felt in your life
Just wanna make it alright
So hold on tight

[Pre-Chorus: Jazzy]
Baby I'm goin' down
'Cause you're never around
And I'm feelin' like I can't let go
Please stay with me (baby please stay with me)
Inside I'm slowly dyin'
And through all my screams and cryin'
I am holdin' on with all my mind
Why can't you see

[Chorus: Jazzy]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
Ayo

[Verse 2: Jazzy]
Please tell me why
You feel this way inside
I really need to know
So I can ease my mind
I wanna make you see
That I'm everything you need
You're every wish, your dream come true
Your fantasy

[Pre-Chorus: Jazzy]
Baby I'm goin' down
'Cause you're never around
And I'm feelin' like I can't let go
Please stay with me (baby please stay with me)
Inside I'm slowly dyin'
And through all my screams and cryin'
I am holdin' on with all my mind
Why can't you see

[Chorus: Jazzy]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down

[Pre-Verse Ad-Libs: Fabolous]
Yeah, yo

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
I try to speak real to the bitches
They think I'm Meek Mill with the bitches
They think it's a menage e'ery night
Foreigns come out the garage e'ery night
Private jets for me and the entourage e'ery night
They don't know the struggle real niggas gotta juggle
When the foreigns was shuttles, when the pools was puddles
All the slick rebuttals turn to come through and cuddle
Niggas that acted subtle now wanna be in the huddle
But everybody who doubted gettin' flexed on first
And everybody who hated gettin' flexed on worst
They don't wanna see you level up, they holdin' you son
The one you take a bullet for's probably holdin' the gun (foreal)
And they can't wait to sell you out at your next auction
Don't you ever pay to play: no extortion
Get yourself a baddie in them Rolex watches
Take her home and fuck her like your ex watchin'

[Chorus: Jazzy]
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
I'm goin' down
