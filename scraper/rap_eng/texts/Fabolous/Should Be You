[Intro: Fabolous]
You know, things don't always go as they should
(oh oh no), right (oh oh no)
Don't you hate a could've would've should've nigga
(oh oh no, oh oh no)
Could've did, would've did, well you should've nigga
(oh oh no, oh oh no)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
If I had a dollar for every should be, you know how rich I would be?
Like they say it is what it is, not what it could be
Can't cry, feel guilt over spilt milk
I'm too fly, I'm too cool, word to Versace silk
And my watch be filled with mad diamonds
I got good watches, just bad timing
The chick I met at the club was cute
Still feel like I'm getting brain from the substitute
Cause this ain't you and I ain't me
Claim you happy then why you so mad at me?
Can't hold on to what you had, just what you got
You should be here, but you're not

[Hook: Ne-Yo:]
I'm doing it again
What I told myself I would not do, oh
It's 4:15 AM
I'm sitting here drinking, reminiscing on you, oh
And how I used to let you smoke even though I don't
You get blowed then we both get low
As I lay here with some girl I don't know
In the back of my mind, one millionth time
I tell myself it should be you, should be you
Should be you with me, right now
Said it should be you (should be you)
Should be you (should be you)
Should be you with me, right now, uh

[Verse 2: Ne-Yo]
As I watch her sleep, all that I can think
She's beautiful (beautiful), but she's not you
Love for just a night, then out of my life (out of my life)
Damn, why can't I do this right when you told me you wanted to leave? (wanted to leave)
I pretended it didn't hurt me (didn't hurt me)
But as I lay here, I can hardly breathe
Laying next to she, when in reality, it should be...

[Hook: Ne-Yo]
It should be you (oh), should be you (should be you)
Should be you with me, (with me) right now (right now)
Said it should be you (oh) should be you (oh oh)
Should be you with me (oh with me) right now (aha)
(ooh) should be you, should be you baby (ahh)

[Verse 3: Puff Daddy]
Ay yo check this out
My life, lights cameras fame and action
Feeling drained from all this private planes I'm catchin'
Willing to trade all the flashy chains I'm flashin for a night
Back for us, exchangin' pain in passion
Romances, kinda like the phantom doors we used to ride
Cause it's tryin' to open up, it's like suicide (suicide)
God teaches lessons every day
You was all I need in life, Meth and Mary J (come on)
The sun don't shine forever
Anytime that we fall, it just means we climb together (together)
Guess we avoided when we couldn't went through
That don't change the fact that it should'be been you

[Hook Until Fade: Ne-Yo:]
It should be you (oh), should be you, should be you
Should be you with me, right now, right now
Said it should be you, should be you
Should be you and me, right now (aha)
Uhh uhh, said it should be you, it should be you baby (ahh)
