[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
This is separation, somethin' like segregation
You ain't nothin' like us, nigga
You can't stand wit' us, you can't sit wit' us, you can't ride wit' us
Fuck you talkin' 'bout?
I don't fuck with you niggas, can't ride with y'all
I like my checks marked up nigga
Nothin' like you

[Verse 1: Problem]
What
I don't love 'em, I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em
Niggas is suckas, think they gotta cuff 'em to fuck 'em
Goin' through customs with your sweety squeezin' her muffins like it's all good 'cause it's all good
Money on the wood
If niggas wanna challenge mine, you niggas hearts is Valentine
Calculated grind
Silent when doin' any crime
I'm just not your kind and that's fine
But please don't push me nowhere near that line 'cause oh my
Let me spark my weed
Keep havin' dreams of makin' plays wit' ease
Ferrari clean, top down, what an amazin' scene
The shit I teach ain't got shit to do with A's and B's
Don't give a F, niggas see I did my thang with D's

[Bridge: Problem & Dave East]
Yeah
I don't love 'em, I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em
I don't love 'em, I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em
Pass me that, yeah
Need a light, uh
Know I don't love 'em, nigga
I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em, fuck it
What!

[Verse 2: Dave East]
Makin' my way through traffic (Traffic)
Lately I just been stackin' lame niggas' hate with a passion
Shot 'em out his VaporMaxes
Don't want no smoke, when I see 'em, they pass her (Pass her)
My niggas investin' in ratchets
My bitch in the valley get hit with the package
Not talkin' 'bout Trina, this bitch is the baddest
Hard to show love and I never chase (Yeah)
I'm up in Chase high off a eighth, maybe a quarter
Just got off the phone with my lawyer and he said they threw out my case (Yes)
Everything straight
I'm duckin' these hoes like niggas is shootin'
After we fuck, I get right back to recruitin'
I still got bitches that's boostin'
I still got hittas that's shootin'
Trust me
This pimpin', I might let you touch me, uh
I get this shit right through custies, uh
I gave her some dick, now she love me
I ain't had not a dub not in my pocket back when them bitches dubbed me
Now I'm in the club, snub in my pocket
Tell the bouncer not to bump me
But fuck 'em, I don't love 'em
I don't chase 'em, duck 'em, replace 'em
In the bank, cupid shuffle, Goyard duffel

[Bridge: Problem & Dave East]
Yeah
I don't love 'em, I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em
Never
Yeah
I don't love 'em, I don't chase 'em, I duck 'em

Hahaha

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Ay, shawty lookin' at me like she know somethin', ay ay
Came and gave me brain now I know somethin' (Look look)
Cops question me, think I know somethin'
But I don't know nothin' even when I know somethin'
You know somethin'? Errybody know somethin'
But before I talk, a Yes Man'll know somethin' (Yeah)
Rap didn't work, nigga, just know somethin' (Just know)
I'd be robbing son, could know somethin' (On God)
Gotta thank God he musta knew somethin' (Bless)
Everyday these kids need a new somethin' (Facts)
Can't even pronounce it, it's a new somethin' (What?)
My old hoes like, "You actin' new or somethin'?" (That's hard)
