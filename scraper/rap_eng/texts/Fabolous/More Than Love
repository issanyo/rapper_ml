[Chorus]
How can we make it, love, when I don't trust?
How can we make it, love?
How can we make it, love, when I don't trust you?
We need more than love

Cause everythin' is everythin'
When we're just makin' love
But how can we make it, love, when I don't trust you?
We need more than love, more than love

[VERSE 1: Amerie]
It's a bad situation and I'm tired of pretendin'
Everythin' is alright when we argue
Half the time, almost every night

It's a hard road I'm facin'
So maybe I should keep it movin'
Cause I can only trust you, baby
Far as I can see what's in front of me

[PRE-Chorus]
You keep tellin' me
That I keep askin' you these questions
That don't make no sense
But we both know they do (they do)

Now we arguin'
And now you're leavin' once again
And I just sit here wonderin' what will I do (I do)

[Chorus]

[VERSE 2: Fabolous]
Answer me this, now do you really wanna go there?
Cause if we go just know we won't make it back
Just cause yo girlfriend said it don't make it fact
If anythin' her corny ass just make it wack

We all say you shit then take it back
I think I listen to too much drake in fact
Cause I'm the best you ever you had
Your friends just mad cause I'm the best they never had

And if you don't trust nothin' you can trust that
I come with new shit and have 'em like what's that?
That's loso in case you didn't know so
And trust me, I don't even trust me

[Chorus]

[BRIDGE: Amerie]
And I don't care that you're thinkin'
Every time you turn around I'm trippin'
I got my intuition and I got receipts
I ain't seein' things

It's hard to live with the question
Who you with and what you're doin'
I'm keepin' one eye open
So don't even try to Jedi my mind

[PRE-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[OUTRO: Amerie]
It's a hard road, baby, it's a hard road, baby
It's a hard road, baby, lovin' you, lovin' you, yeah
Cause I don't trust you, baby, I don't trust you, baby
But I love you, baby, but I need more than love from you, yeah
