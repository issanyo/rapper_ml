[Hook]
A nigga young, say they coming on a one-way
Wake em down, I be in town Monday
It's for my niggas on the freeway
Riding dirty, do the limit, take it easy
Everytime you see me on that 9-5 (rollin!)
22's sitting on them shit's boy!
Bad bitch on a steering wheel just
A nigga just (rollin!)

Everytime you see me on the 7-5
We got them choppers in this bich, boy!
26's and we sitting on high
A nigga just (rollin!)

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
It's on y'all, I'm on call
That check come, we gon' ball
Like wiz work, like John Wall
You hate that shit, don't y'all?
Real niggas, no cornballs
Pussy just a phone call
You stand for something or you gon' fall
I make it happen, I don't stall
Bullshit: don't try that
That full clip in my strap
That logo on my cap say "NY"
That's my trap. Shout out to my hood
Too real to fake that. A BK nigga, I was
Brought up on "take that
Then flip that, then take that"
You got ass, then shake that
Them ones drop like leaves hoe
Tell somebody rake that
Riding down that 95 on my way to 85
I'm rolling while my lady drives
An all-black Mercedes ride

[Hook]
(Rollin!) Everytime you see me on that 95
22's sitting on them shit's boy!
Bad bitch on a steering wheel just
A nigga just (rollin!)

[Verse 2 - Young Jeezy]
I'm riding, I'm rolling, I'm holding
Stop hoping my cell phone ?
Stop smoking. Beep beep! Phone call
Nigga you joking
M.I., NY, A-Town, East Oakland
Just counted, they too short
No words like Too Short
Vanilla cig Dutch Masters
I smoke them like Newports
Hood nigga in that Turbo
Naw we don't do sports
Failure to appear
Real nigga don’t do court
Like a wife beater
I bare arms
One time that bail bonds
In an outa the same house
In the same spot with the same powder
A-town that my trap
Rich off that my rap
Yeah ho you see me
Real walk that my dap
Shades on im so cool
Foos with me its so foo
28 getchya two six
Yeah nigga that’s old school

Bad bitch she shot gun on three beans she fucked up
