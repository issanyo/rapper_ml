[Intro]
Where you at?
You know I'm at the studio man, what you doing, you gon' come through?
Yeah I'ma come through. I might rock the mic too
{"C-SICK"}
Haha, I bet. Yeah, hahah

[Pre-Chorus]
I just got the crib with the studio
You could say I live at the studio
Shawty come and give at the studio

[Chorus]
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
(at the studio)
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
(at the studio)
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
(at the studio)
(All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette)

[Verse 1]
Got a condo with nothin' but condoms in it
Same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette
Shawty came through just to hear the mixtape (Soul Tape)
Ended up starrin' in a sex tape (ohh!)
With a player from New York, no Knicks tape (swish)
Might need your bitch for my next day (hah!)
I come upstairs then I come get them drawers
Come back downstairs then I come up with bars
Shit feels so good it might come out tomorrow
Beat that shit up, she might come out with scars
I do not lie, I been the truth
If I'm in her box, I say that I'm in the booth
Comin' up with the headlines
That's off the top of the head (whoa, whoa)
Heard she nasty on the mic
Offer the sloppiest head (whoa, whoa)
Then she gon' bust that thing wide
I'ma just let that thing ride (whoa, whoa)
{*squeaking*} Ohh, I'm cumin!

[Pre-Chorus]
I just got the crib with the studio
You could say I live at the studio
Shawty come and give at the studio

[Chorus]
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
(at the studio)
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh

All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
(at the studio)
(All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette)

[Verse 2]
No slow jams just street nigga rap
Want R&B smooth, get an R&B dude
Got a Range and a Benz, I make R&B moves
But I can call Trey, you in an R&B mood?
And get him, to the, studio
Like "wassup this Fab
Got a bad bitch with me and she up for grabs"
Talkin' 'bout "ask him what's up with this collab?" (huh)
And she waitin' at the studio
Sign on the door that say "No hatin at the studio" (no hatin')
And I always keep it playa at the studio (real playa)
Every time she ask I say I'm at the studio (nice)
Layin' somethin' down (haha)
See how I was snappin' on my last shit (yeah)
How I start off with the slow flow (feel me?)
Then switch it up to some fast shit (feel me? feel me? feel me?)
Nigga don't make me go Bone Thug your bitch (Bone, Bone, Bone)
I love this shit but I don't love your bitch

[Bridge: screwed]
Rap.. sex
Rap.. sex
All I do is rap and sex, all I do is rap and sex
All I do is rap and sex...
Pussy got me screamin', Meek Mill flow (ho!)
Spray it like Ma$e ("uh-huh") speak real slow
You with a boss one, Rick Ross grunt (Ugh!)
Nasty like Nas, One Mic wise (all I need is one mic)
Best I ever had (crazy), word to Drake
Bustin off the grill leadin' Chiraq, murder rate (let's get it!)
Kiss on it (HA-HAAEEH!), excuse my French (haan!)
Hit the studio, rap and sex

[Pre-Chorus]
I just got the crib with the studio
You could say I live at the studio
Shawty come and give at the studio

[Chorus]
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
(at the studio)
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh
(at the studio)
All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette, uhh

(All I do is rap and sex
Nigga see how I was flowin' on my last cassette)
