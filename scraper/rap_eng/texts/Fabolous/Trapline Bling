[Hook: Josh K]
You used to call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs
Call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs
I know when that trapline bling
That can only mean one thing
Cause I know when that trapline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1: Josh K]
Ever since I left the city you
You got a new connect now
Say you got that work and you got pounds now
I see you charged up cause you the plug now
Ever since I left the city you
Started getting money, now you got hoes
Spending hella bands ant the new store
Hanging with some lames I've never seen before

[Hook: Josh K]
You used to call me on my trap phone

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
When the pay callin, that's bae callin'
I played the field now I'm play callin'
In the old days it was Jays callin'
Now it's Lenny sayin Jay's callin'
And them some old hoe just hit this number
Want the wood, tryna get this lumber
Got me sounding like X in Belly
"How the fuck did you get this number?!"
Know these girls love a street mogul
That catch plays and eat noble
With the Balmains, knees ripped open
And the burnout, that flip open
Trap King, need a trap Queen
We call that trap royalty
If we lick together we'll be rich forever
Call that trap loyalty
So stay down, I'ma hit you back
Got one, tryna get two back
Whip a Benz, tryna get two back
Let a real nigga sit you back
Fly you in then get flew back
Got your ex tryna get you back
Grab the mic, tell that bitch move back
I would like to make a shout out to
All my hustlers out here that just love to grind
You gon' have to call me back another time
Bitch I got El Chapo on the other line
So only call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs

[Hook: Josh K]
Call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs
I know when that trapline bling
That can only mean one thing
Cause I know when that trapline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 3: Josh K]
Can you tell me somthin'?
Why all on my line
Tellin' me that I'm a liar
Thinking I'm out with these hoes
When I'm really at the studio
I'm out here in these streets risking my freedom just to
Give you a better future
Shawty I'm out trappin'
Which means I'm taking risks and prospering

[Hook: Josh K]
You used to call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs
Call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs
I know when that trapline bling
That can only mean one thing
Cause I know when that trapline bling
That can only mean one thing
You used to call me on my trap phone

[Outro: Fabolous]
Fabolous: Yo, I thought I told you not call me on this pohne, what's up?
