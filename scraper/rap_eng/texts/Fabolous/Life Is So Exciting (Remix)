[Initial Sample]
So why don’t you leave me alone?
For life is so exciting on the island in my room
And as I sing and dance along the shadows of the moon

[Intro: Fabolous]
You know it's funny
People on the outside don't really get what's going on
But they always got something to say
Yeah

[Hook: Fabolous]
It’s the life, the life, the life is so exciting
The life, the life, the life is so exciting
The life, the life, the life is so exciting
The life, the life, the life is so exciting baby

[Verse 1: Ryan Leslie]
Black tints, black suits
Black trucks, black boots
Black chucks, bandanas
My Spanish chick, she loves Santana
Supernatural, Carlos
Buying cash - no car notes
Boss status, Donnie Ienner
Your wife but that's my vagina
Take a picture it'll last longer
You fast-talking I'm cash-talking
Past-talking about old problems
My new crib it got gold columns
Statues, Hirst skulls
Lear jet to my rehearsal
Wool coat with that mink lining
My Black card is not declining
I'm certified - Chase Private
Self-made but I stay striving
Red 'Rari I'm race-driving, switching lanes and I'm Face-Timing
My accountant - stock trades, short-selling I'm not afraid
High-risk, high-reward. So blessed. My Lord

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
It’s beach weather over here nigga, sky’s clear nigga
That’s flip flops, that’s Americana, that’s Hilfiger
Yacht Masters at the yacht party, sitting at the dock is a drop 'Rari
That’s pole position with a joystick, that’s push-button that’s like Atari
Raising the bar, no parallel, so many horses, carousel
How we roll out like a caravan, ghost in the snow, see Carol Anne
Maryland, tags on it, heroine, bags on it
Hermes throw pillows, Missoni couch and they clash on it
Take a look in my viewfinder, see seven figures and two commas
See bad bitches, see blue diamonds, I see-saws I two time'em
Jiggalo, juggle hoes, jigsaw, I puzzle those
Crosswords, cross birds, I cross country with a couple those

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Where the sun is out, we runs about
Let the world see what these honeys 'bout
Ain't seen this since the one was out
With Jay, Pimp C, and Bun
We out here, still pimpin' that Big
Lookin' at Jig, somebody go call Hype Willi
We need slo-mo, mo' Rose Mo'
Niggas is drunk and type-silly
We dancin' like Dame, holding up chains
Look, got PMBs on a big-ass boat on molly rolling up jane
This life is so exciting
That money be so inviting
So fuck what they're indicting tell my lawyers keep on fighting
For the life...

[Hook]

[Verse 4]
South Beach, spent time there, Offshore's my time wear
Whole crew got they own watch, nigga we ain’t buying no time-shares
The lifestyle, too fly, my new bitches get next-flighted
I'd say I'm back to the old me, but my old bitches'll get excited
Ain’t going back, I’m stepping forward, don’t test me, been prepping for it
Got no time for that hating shit, my young niggas got weapons for it
Got Chief Keef's that ain’t shy, that bang-bang, that blocka
And all you niggas is blockers, change your name to Ibaka
Shit real, shit been real, and shit just get realer
I’m showing bitches my car keys then ask them what’s the dealer
Ain’t saying that’s your girl, ain’t saying shit like prank callers
Cause it’s a small world and hoes make it even smaller

[Hook]
