[Hook]
I got you under the red lights right now
And that body looking right right now
I bet you I could make them red lights turn green
I bet you I could make your red lights turn green

[Verse 1 - Ryan Leslie]
I see you built your defense, thats why the mazes in your mind are so complicated
We found a spark I'm saying its time we consummate it
I hear your friends say he's shady you won't' make it
Lets pull that bullshit off until we're both naked
Fully exposed - standing in your honesty
The difference between who you are and who you wanna be
And this is just a preview you know there's more to see
Class is in the details hidden in the embroidery
And its obvious you feeling me
Turn your pillow talk into a script from a soliloquy 
Real page turner, Shades of Grey trilogy
Body language for dummies I'm a master of ventriloquy 
Master of the talk game, words my artillery
Master of the "please Ryan, slow down you're killing me"
You gotta body that was made for the camera
Let me see how it hold up 'gainst this legendary stamina

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
This be her scene
Look at her and me
So incredible it be getting her green
But she be flirting, she be curving
Stop acting 12 girl, its 20 13
Put her on the first thing, Julius Erving
That mean I 6 her til I get in her jeans
I ain't thirsting I'm just knowing what I want
They be hiding how they feel, I be showing what they won't
I be going where they don't
I could take you where they can't
I could score when I want now don't make me go Durant
To the hole if coach give me the go 'head
She say she can't stay but she gave me some to-go head

[Verse 3 - Ryan Leslie]
It'll only take a minute
One chance and I swear you won't forget it babe
I could take you anywhere that your heart will allow
If you take that chance on love
We could find ourselves in love
We'll be getting it til the morning
Oh yea
Up until the morning
Can we get it baby
Up until the morning light
Said we high on love
Up until the morning
Can we get it baby
Up until the morning light

[Hook]

[Outro]
Turn the lights down
There's no one around (oh no)
Just you and me babe
Make them red lights
Make them red lights
Make them red lights turn green
