[Verse: Joe]
You and me, girl, it's just right
So why do you deny?
How you feel, yeah, listen girl
You should be up in my arms at night
And by my side
It's the way it should be, now listen

[Hook: Joe]
We can talk 'bout this forever
Or we can just do what we know is right
So let's just move on 'cause we got love to make girl
Let's do it tonight, don't put up a fight

[Chorus: Joe]
Gotta make you believe that
You and me together would feel so, good
Best believe it
I know you can see that
You and me together would feel so, good
Best believe it
So let's just do it

[Verse 2: Joe]
Baby, you and me fit hand in glove
I'm in love, you're in love, ain't it good to be? yeah
All my life, girl, I've been searching for the perfect one
To be with me, could you be?

[Hook: Joe]
We can talk about this forever
Or we can just do what we know is right
So let's just move on 'cause we got love to make girl
Let's do it tonight, don't put up a fight

[Chorus: Joe]
Gotta make you believe that
You and me together would feel so, good
Best believe it
I know you can see that

Why deny how you really feel inside
Cause baby, all I wanna do is love you
And I swear that it's gone feel, babe
Feel so good

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Now if you be my B-A-B-Y
I can be your P-A-P-I
I need a girl to J me
Sorta like Yonce did to Jay-Z
Kinda like Janet J. did to J.D
And maybe, you could do F-A-B
Maybe baby trying to say we
Don't feel right in the back of that maybe
Yeah, and they want to convince me
That we don't look good on the front of the Bentley
So let's just do it, dress fresh to it
SF to it, with the necklace through it
Wake up in the morning eating breakfast to it
Or keep trying to get up on the guest list to it
J-O-E and they know me
Keep figures, keep niggas on they J-O-B, yeah

[Chorus: Joe]
Gotta make you believe that
You and me together would feel so good
Best believe it
I know you can see that
You and me together would feel so good
Best believe it

Gotta make you believe that
You and me together would feel so good
Best believe it
I know you can see that
You and me together would feel so good
Best believe it
So let's just do it
