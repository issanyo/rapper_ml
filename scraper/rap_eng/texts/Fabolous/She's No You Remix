[Fabolous:]
Now if I ride with a dime, why hop out for pennies
And real talk, I don't really bring the drop out for many
Girl, the way you cop out a mini
I look at your OG, baby, my only
The dudes wanna get in your zipper
Girls hate Cinderella, but still try to fit in her slipper
But they can't compare, 'cause it's all that and some here
Jesse's back... with Jesse Mac, yeah
They got a lot of girls
Who know they got it goin' on
But nothing's ever a comparison to you
Now can't you see
That you're the only one I really want
And everything I need
Is everything you do
Any girl walk by, don't matter
Cause you're looking so much better
Don't ever need to get
Caught up in jealousy
She could be a super-model
Every magazine, the cover
She'll never, ever mean a thing to me

[Chorus:]
She's no you, oh, no
You give me more than I can ever want
She's no you, oh, no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you
They got a lot of girls
Who dance in all the videos
But I prefer the way you do
The way you move
You're more than beautiful
And I just wanna let you know
That all I ever need
Is what I've got with you
Any girl walk by, don't matter
Every time you're looking better
I think you're perfect
There ain't nothin' I would change
She could be a super-model
Every magazine, the cover
She'll never, ever take my heart away

[Chorus:]
She's no you, oh, no
You give me more than I can ever want
She's no you, oh, no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you
No one's ever gonna get to me
Oh, the way you do
Now baby, can't you see
That you're the one, the only one
Who's ever made me feel this way
Nothing's ever coming even close
No one's ever been comparable to you
[Fabolous:]
She's alright, but she's no you
Please know, boo
I'm cool as when a breeze blow through
And it's worse than Chicago
Yeah I'm gettin money, so personally I'll go
Merci-a-lago
Wait 'til the doors go up
'Cause you can see from the torso up
They're gonna floss you up
I'll bring ya to the best
F-A-B-O-L-O-U & to the S, yes
I don't want nothin' I don't got
I don't need nothin' but you
I can't get more than you give me
Don't stop anything you do
You're all that, all that and then some
You know what, just what I need
And no girl, no place, no where
Could mean a thing to me

[Chorus:]
She's no you, oh, no
You give me more than I can ever want
She's no you, oh, no
I'm satisfied with the one I've got
Cause you're all the girl
That I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you, she's no you
She's no you
They got a lot of girls who know they got it goin' on
(You give me more than I could ever want)
She's no you
Now can't you see that your the only one I really want
(Satisfied with the one I got)
Cause your all the girl that I ever dreamed
She's only a picture on a magazine
She's no you
She's no you
