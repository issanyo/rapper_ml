Sippin' on this Brandy, Smokin' on that Keisha
Fell in love with my AK, with a new swisher to Licia
She in between my verses, I'm in between her legs

Damn Misses Badu, there's just something about you
Tell me next lifetime, I'm shooting myself for proof, oops
Tinashe, I'm tryna show you love
Heard you get 2 on, I just need one then I'm good
Mary J, got your number from Puff
I'm young enough to be your son, but what's that 411?
You know I'm just playing, you know I love them ladies
You know I love you like a sister, unless you thinking maybe

[Hook]
