[Intro: Red Cafe]
Yeah, what else...
Shakedowwwwn
No Witnesses, yeah

[Chorus: Fabolous]
This is it, what
Them dollars falling from the sky
Let's get rich, what
Gon' get this money 'fore I die
I can't quit, what
Now pop the Rosé, hit the kush, let's get lit
What, what, what

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Introducing, coconut CÎROC with no juice in
Trying to steal my style be like boosting, I be duecing
On bump bitches talking loose and
You ain't hurting me baby, I just hate a nuisance

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
Huh, it's about that time, now I'm looking at my Audemar
Shorty it's now or never, see tomorrow, I ain't calling ya
I don't give a fuck how many athletes stalking ya
I'm that nigga with the certified sticker
Dynamic uno, dynamic duo
We be the dream team, y'all still induco, Izzr..

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
.. and Loso, I'm only claiming one son, that's Prince Joso
The rest you niggas I be sonning with the flow so
I'm guessing there ain't no need for me to go to Maury Po'
Split ya shit to the white, nigga, Oreo
My shorty blow, call her detonator
She call me Funeral, she think I'ma dead her later
My money too heavy to play 'round with you featherweighters
And y'all ain't doing good enough, I need some better haters

[Verse 4: Red Cafe]
Yeah, huh, yeah
East coast, killer bitch puller, kush burner
Suicide doors on that double R, swerver
Waves so sick, I'm like a Malibu surfer
Pimp game easy, middle name Ike Turner, huh

[Chorus: Fabolous]
This is it, what
Them dollars falling from the sky
Let's get rich, what
Gon' get this money 'fore I die
I can't quit, what
Now pop the Rosé, hit the kush, let's get lit
What, what, what

[Verse 5: Red Cafe]
Huh, you know I smoke good, Willie Wonka in the dutchie
Ten Patrón shots, she in the club trying to fuck me
Tell a friend tell a friend - I'm back, dope peddling
I'm half past seven, want it all, no settlement
On a world tour, bottles on pour
Fresher than Febreze, please, I need a encore (what else?)
Lyrically, Cafe connected umbilically
I'll leave ya body bed critically, it's moving

[Verse 6: Fabolous]
And who the hell would wanna go against the movement
'Cause if you do, tool time, Home Improvement
No decoration, no speculation
I ain't playing with you niggas, no recreation
I got a line on you cats like a Tiger strip
So you got it coming to you like Tiger wife
Diddy call me Goldie 'cause I'm a smooth speaker
Foot to her ass with a red bottom sneaker
Goldie said.. I like that.. put a foot to her ass, I like that, hahaha

[Chorus: Fabolous]
This is it, what
Them dollars falling from the sky
Let's get rich, what
Gon' get this money 'fore I die
I can't quit, what
Now pop the Rosé, hit the kush, let's get lit
What, what, what

[Outro: Red Cafe]
Huh, it's too easy
It's that Shakedown, Street Fidda didda dam experience
Yeah, believe that...
