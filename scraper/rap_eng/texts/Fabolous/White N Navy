Ah huh, you know what it is
White and Navy, white and navy, white and navy, white and navy
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
White and Navy, white and navy, white and navy, white and navy
Nice

Ah huh, you know what it is
Welcome to my city where we do it big
Ah huh, shawty thats nothing
When you put on for your city baby that's something
For my town I am known to put it down
White and Navy, white and navy, white and navy, white and navy
Who at the city say it with me and lets shut it down
White and Navy, white and navy, white and navy, white and navy

I wear my Yankee hat like it was crown
I did it big then, like I does it now
Thats why they throw it at me, like the own the mall
Came up so it's more than likely going down
When I'm in the town thats Ciroc pourin'
And that Marley Marl, 4 doorin'

Screaming whats up, I'm like damn cutie
You got a Pam booty, that ass Cole stupid
I bet she got some Gina head that be so stupid
I be the biggest fan, no groupie
Ask about me they gon say they want none of son
So its amari on these niggas still number 1
Nice

[Chorus]
Ah huh, you know what it is
Welcome to my city where we do it big
Ah huh, shawty thats nothing
When you put on for your city baby that's something
For my town I am known to put it down
White and Navy, white and navy, white and navy, white and navy
Who at the city say it with me and lets shut it down
White and Navy, white and navy, white and navy, white and navy
