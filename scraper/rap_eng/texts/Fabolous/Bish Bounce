[Chorus]
Let these niggas know your worth
Ain't no discounts
They ain't got it better get it
Tell a bitch bounce
All dimes see a nine point that bitch out
She get ejected and corrected like a miscount
Bitch bounce
Had to tell that bitch bounce
Vinylz on the track and that bitch bounce (yeah)
Bitch bounce
Had to tell that bitch bounce
(Lemme tell you what I told her)
Ass like that make that bitch bounce

[Verse 1]
You should make more moves and make less announcements (yeah)
Ain't with that talking bitch save that for counseling (say it)
Looked in here brown skin just keep that shit bouncing?
All of these boys with me bring large amounts in (woo!)
All of these gold chains weigh 36 ounces (uh-huh)
All of this foreign shit can't even pronounce it (uh-huh)
Is it Givenchy or is it Givaunchy? (I don't know)
Tisci the seats and now it's a Givenjeep (woo!)
Top off that wrangler
You know me no stranger (huh)
Hang like a dangler, bitch look like Topanga (okay)
That boy meet world, I swear you are in danger (okay)
Its time to score, I don't choke I'm no strangler
I ball, I'm balling my nigga
Ball on these bitches
That's word to Sky Digga (yeah)
Gimme my shot and I'm squeezing my trigga (woo!)
My homies bust too and that's word to Rah Digga (woo!)

[Chorus]
Let these niggas know your worth
Ain't no discounts
They ain't got it better get it
Tell a bitch bounce
All dimes see a nine point that bitch out
She get ejected and corrected like a miscount
Bitch bounce
Had to tell that bitch bounce
Vinylz on the track and that bitch bounce (yeah)
Bitch bounce
Had to tell that bitch bounce
(Lemme tell you what I told her)
Ass like that make that bitch bounce

[Bridge]
Bounce up and down, need no trampoline
Made it slow down, no Promethazine
Run me my money, no hesitance
You know my work, no need resume - bounce

[Verse 2]
Look, ain't go to say that I flex check my biceps
In your bitch mouth like I’m gossip
That boy be so fresh to death bury me in my closet
Don’t make excuse make deposit
Ain't even suppose to be here boy I come from the projects
Shawty just fuck with my progress
I swear I came here with nothing, all this shit is profit
Should look at me like a prophet
And when these niggas throw subs, it just confirm my gangsta
Scared to say my name now ain't cha
No disrespect, we just on different sides of the wave
I'm providing the wave, you just riding the wave, bounce

[Chorus]
Let these niggas know your worth
Ain't no discounts
They ain't got it better get it
Tell a bitch bounce
All dimes see a nine point that bitch out
She get ejected and corrected like a miscount
Bitch bounce
Had to tell that bitch bounce
Vinylz on the track and that bitch bounce
Bitch bounce
Had to tell that bitch bounce
Ass like that make that bitch bounce

[Break]
Ery'body know I got more pounds than a ounce...
Ery'body know I got more pounds than a ounce..
Ery'body know I got more pounds than a ounce...
Ery'body know I got more pounds than a ounce..
Bounce...

[Bridge]
Bounce up and down, need no trampoline
Made it slow down, no Promethazine
Run me my money, no hesitance
You know my work, no need resume - bounce
