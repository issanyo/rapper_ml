[Verse 1]
When you think of me, you think of the nicest
My slow flow's a modern-day crisis, these freestyles are priceless
All you gon' hear is God damns and Jesus Christes
While these 90s beats become religious sacrifices
Rap game's ISIS, studio terrorism
Lira Galore came through, helped me with the lyricism
These is hard bars, type you only hear in prison
Swag rap got you blind, this shit'll clear your vision
Grass cut low, so you can catch em' being snake
Cause everybody real 'til you catch 'em bein' fake
And I write my mean shit when I'm in a nice mood
And Friday's ain't been this good since Ice Cube's
See, behind every nice dude is a monster
They say behind every bad bitch is a sponsor
Just remember that this time could be your last time
That's why I'm out here rappin' like it's my last rhyme
So, stop complaining and get in your swag
In other words, get out your feelings and get in your bag
My nigga, your biggest problem is you care too much
And you always around, you be there too much
And it's, Fuck what you heard cause you hear too much
You just a lookin'-ass nigga and you stare too much
And over here we don't care for such
It's so real, shorty still hop in and be like, Here's your dutch
And now we rollin', blowin' Cali in the whip, stylin'
She actin' like it's a molly and her shit smilin'
She ain't listen, she probably in the whip wildin'
Suckin' like it's the Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge
Uh, play-off game on the seventy-inch
And I'm the type of player that never get benched
Bitches wanna hang you, never the lynch
I'm tryin' to live this dream and never get pinched
Just somethin' 'bout my shit, I got it figured out
Bitch, I don't need your number, I'm seven-figured out
Nowadays, it looks like talk is all these niggas 'bout
Seems like the smallest pockets always have the biggest mouth
And being broke is a joke, I know I shouldn't laugh
That's why I come for everything they said I couldn't have
Before I go, only thing I want to mention is...
Money ain't the root of all evil now, attention is

[Hook]
Chillin', sittin' in a Ghost, quarter-million
While all these niggas actin' jealous in their feelings
Next few years, I'm a stack it to the ceilin'
All for the love and keep killin', yeah

Chillin', sittin' in a Ghost, quarter-million
While all these niggas actin' jealous in their feelings
Next few years, I'm a stack it to the ceilin'
All for the love and keep killin', yeah
