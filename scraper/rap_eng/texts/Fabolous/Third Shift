[Verse: Fabolous]
Pullin' third shift outside of the chicken spot
Jimmy and king of New York but a (?) not
All black on, dark shades, no chain
Somethin' bout the way he moves say he sold cane
Get my nigga work, give the lil kids dollars
Extra phone'll let the niggas doin' bids holler
If hustle was religion y'all would have faith in me
I pull money out like I got a safe in me
Swish, my J's nice as shit
Life's a gamble, why not play dice and shit
I made ice my shit
Cause gettin' out the hood was 4th & 29 and I Ray Riced the shit
Watch your money even if somebody watch it for you
Time ain't on your side, don't let your watches spoil
Came up hard now I goes down easy
The game on rookie mode, I'm who your girl lookin' for

[Hook]
I got that hard, got that work
I got a couple draws of that perc
I got that hard, got that work
It's just another hard day at work
It's just another hard day at work
It's just another hard day at work
It's just another hard day at work
