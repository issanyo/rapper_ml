Richgirls, Loso, here we go, uh

Swagger opposite of left, money opposite of small
Being fly is a crime then the cops would get a call
I could move through a room full of roaches nice
And I still turn heads poltergeist
Rock a cold chain neck full of Soulja Ice
You young boys should listen to me like adults advice
I could help ya get ya swag elevated
My look is copy written, you could tell I made it
It should be celebrated, national holiday
I'm just doin' me, I flash a few dollars, hey
My fashion's modern day, my passion probably
Thug like Henny with a splash of Alize
I be with Richgirls, you niggas pay respect
And y'all ain't eatin 'cause ya probably couldn't pay the check
Swagga right, my shit stay correct
Them boys go hard, my dick stay erect

I'm posted up right here
Go on and drop a line on me, on me
DJ playin' my song
Better make a move on me, on me
Get your swagger right
(If you wanna push up on a girl like me)
Get your swagger right
(If you wanna push up on a girl like me)

I'm lookin' like a centerfold, so fly
Shawty walk by, tried to catch my eye
Had him on his tippy toes, won't lie
A Richgirl put 'em on a natural high

I know you wanna play it off and act hard
It is what it is, better play your part
See you wanna run a game on my heart
Here's the opportunity for you to start

I'm posted up right here
Go on and drop a line on me, on me
DJ playin' my song
Better make a move on me, on me
Get your swagger right
(If you wanna push up on a girl like me)
Get your swagger right
(If you wanna push up on a girl like me)

That alcohol got you faded, boy, don't fall
Better put ya back up against the wall
Don't be yellin' me ear, boy, when you talk
Come a little closer or don't holler at all

Make sure that yo' confidence is on 10
Gotta make me feel like you in it to win
Every boy wants a Richgirl they can get with
Listen to the song givin' you the blueprint

I'm posted up right here
Go on and drop a line on me, on me
DJ playin' my song
Better make a move on me, on me
Get your swagger right
(If you wanna push up on a girl like me)
Eh, get your swagger right
(If you wanna push up on a girl like me)

Don't be
(Heart donor, heart donor)
No
(Don't turn out to be a love loner)
A love loner
(Have dinner, just to get with her)
Just to get with her
(I ain't lookin' for no Indian giver)
Oh, no
(Heart donor, heart donor)
Heart donor
(Don't turn out to be a love loner)
Try not to be a love loner
(Have dinner, just to get with her)
Just to get with her
(I ain't lookin' for no Indian giver)
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I'm getting money, I can never be the same
New address but the neighbors know my name
I confess I'm addicted to your frame
It took a Richgirl to come and set this shit clean
Pocket full of tokens is the camera lens focused
Flyer than a falling star, I see your swagger need coachin'
Follow your boy, no, not Twitter
Give that nigga back his ring, mine a whole lot glitter
Excuse me, bigga, Biggie, Jigga, Ricky Rosé
Madamé liquor
Ring side fights, late night Skypes
Sincerely yours, Mr. Swagger Right

Hey, I'm posted up right here, yeah
Go on and drop a line on me
(On me)
DJ playin' my song, oh
Betta make a move on me
(On me)
Get your swagger right
(If you wanna push up on a girl like me)
Eh, get your swagger right
(If you wanna push up on a girl like me)
