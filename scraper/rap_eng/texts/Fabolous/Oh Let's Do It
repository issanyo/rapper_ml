[Verse One: Fabolous]
Unh I'ma kill 'em dead, come & get the bodies up
Bitches tryna kick it, like they just took Karate up
They talkin' some christmas shit, sayin what the fuck they want
Need to call the next nigga, who care 'bout what the fuck they want?
Hung up on that ho bruh, save that shit for Oprah
When i spit i kill shit, should of been a cobra
Hit you with that sober, call that shit the come-down
Call me Young Funeral , A.K.A Cemetery nigga, A.K.A I bury niggas
My verse go first, like it ride in a hearse
You jerks get merked when i put it in work
R.I.P pics put on shirts, all you niggas get put in dirt
Any nigga ever step a foot on earth, get layed down like foot ball turf
Face turn blue, niggas look like smurfs

[Hook: Fabolous]
Yeaaaaa, ho let's do it; ho let's do it; ho let's do it
Yeaaaaa, get embombing fluid, these niggas too wet, time for some new shit

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
Holdin' ma nuts, like you rollin', what's up?
Girl these Paul Bearer niggas are just holding you up
Tell 'em they can find a hole & go lay they ass in it
Or sip a vanilla shake with broken glass in it
Hope up in this two door; you know i black on black mine
I want this to kill niggas, that's that black on black crime
You ain't seein' my watch, that's that black on black time
Black rocks, black gold, that's that black on black shine
Two much sour diesel got the homie movie slow-mo
Nine been on me bitch, way longer than Romo
Catch yo ass in New York City while you here for promo
You know that your ass fucked, PAUSE, no homo
Y'all are just wavy niggas, this is ah sunami here
Y'all are Abercrombie gear, this is black  Damier
First 48 flow, i just caught a hommy here
There's is no competion 2

DJ DRAMA yeaaaaaaa
