[Intro]
[Fabolous] Fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all [x8]
[Red Cafe] (What else?)

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
You so lame it should be your first name
And I'm so raw, I'm Bolivian cocaine
I'm the next of kin to Loso or Kane
I'm disrespectful I'm drivin' in both lanes
They pushin' my buttons to fuck with my campaign
They know Jermaine is here to take over the game
Now Arm and Hammer chain or the Konvict chain
The Shakedown chain, I clean it in champagne (what else?)
Then I take aim and I blocka, blocka
Them heavyweight shots from the choppa, choppa
You could google Cafe, I'm a shotta, shotta
And me no play play wit no rappa, rappa
Since the bubble L-E-X-U-S (yeah)
I been swervin' and servin' the whole U-S (ah)
The Remi' and the Bourbon be burnin' my chest (uh)
S-F we the best, middle finger to the rest

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
I said fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
Cause I shop so much I smell like the fuckin' mall
There so many guns, ain't no where to tuck 'em all
And you might dodge one, let me see you duck 'em all
No way, no how, shit I know that
Almost as much as I know OJ will blow trial
I be in the club, Rose', no smiles
Few pretty chicks like OK can we go now
I must be da niggy I run in your house
Snatch your little Russie and Diggie
It's nothin' no biggie
And if I have to I do it myself
I'm feelin' like a Puff with no Biggie
Now these joker nigga's O.D
Pullin' the Heath Ledge'
So I'm a kill a cow, make sure that the beef's dead
Burger ass nigga's I look further past nigga's
And go over the head of Uncle Murda ass nigga's
I said, fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all
