[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I walk in rooms and get attention I ain't even want
Coulda flexed when I saw you, I ain't even stunt
Pull up on 'em in the back I ain't even front
Eating off of a day party, I ain't even lunch
But sometimes you gotta miss a meal to make a mil
Just because you making money that don't make you real
Put her hands in my pants, had to make her feel
Playing with that black mamba, how that Laker feel
I might go Kobe in that thing
Might go Kobe with the rings
Slide up in it five times
Pop them bottles five times
I hit 50 on 'em niggas, came through with 5 dimes
5 shots, five lines
Soo-wu, five slimes
Ay, all my girls shaped like Donald Jones guitar
She said tape it just so you can watch it on your phone tomorrow

[Verse 2: Dave East]
I got misses in different cities, they ain't never meeting
I do hotels then see the penthouse, they ain't ever leaving
I told her I don't do no drugs, I just be heavy weeded
She know I really was outside, I been in every precinct
She bended over, I get closer, lotta heavy breathing
She told me I was in her stomach, I get very deep in
That ass for me, she splashed the cheeks until that bed is leaking
My iPhone keep me in drama, I wish I had a beeper
The loudest reefer, cold champagne, I'm in Italian sneakers
She never speak on how we creeping guess that's now our secret
Monday to Thursday I'm grinding so we get wild as Weeknd
Smell like she fresh out the shower, no doubt I'm down to eat it
We in Christians his and her
Daily switching different purse
I do Henny, she do vodka, hit it before she go to work
Out in pubic we be touching, people talking like yo y'all bugging
Me and her be taking flights, we got matching Goyard luggage, uh
