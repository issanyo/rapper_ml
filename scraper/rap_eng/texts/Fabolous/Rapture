[Intro: Fabolous]
I love that, I love that
I love to see the homies getting to it
(Ain't nothing realer than that)
You know I love that crew love (the gang)
You know with the home team eating like, everybody level up
(The Family, we all chasing a bag, real recognize real)
And the baddies recognize that too, that's why
(They wanna be with us) I got one, and the bro got the other one
(They get the best view over here) and cuz got the other one
(You know kings need queens, right?!)
Oh, they loving the crew, man

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yeah, caught up in the rapture of love
Rock the 7's in Toronto, show the Raptors some love
Take a picture with my niggas trying to capture the love
We from the bottom but we trying to adapt to above
See for y'all that'll prolly be a caption you love
But for us it goes back to the strap and the gloves
Back to the birds of the white, we was trapping them doves
Here today, gone tomorrow like a Snapchat for thugs
So you gotta keep your circle tight, never let it hula hoop
Niggas gon' shoot they shot especially when you the hoop
I'ma do the Sprinter van 'til we all can do the coupe
The war stories sound way better when your crew the troops
I want for me what I want for them and I'm not a quitter
Most haters don't get better, they get bitter
My nigga couldn't hit her, so he said I had to get her
And if we both want her, fuck it, we can split her
One night with a hitter made her reconsider
Paper on the strip club floor, bitch we came to litter
But everything ain't gold just 'cause it fucking glitter
And if she ain't a go getter, then fo'get her
Before the road money we was hood jugging
Before the baddies we was plucking hood boogers
That just make the level up better
When life is a bitch and we ain't never upset her, my niggas

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
And it feels like love
And it feels like love
When it feels, oh
Drop top coupes in the winter, babe
We just moving like the winners, baby
Drinks up, if you feel the same
Ooooooh, na na na na
Oh baby, yeah, oh na

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
(Kill kill kill!) HA-HAAAEEH!
Caught up in the rapture of love
From where they shoot it out, slap box and scrap with the thugs
Went to all different cities on the map with the drugs
Instead of re'ing up, we just came back with the plugs
This is post rap, yeah I'm talking after the buzz
We became legends, they was pushing Acuras cuz
With the same brethrens, we ain't know what accurate was
We had each other though, that's what impacted the love
This is back when you could bring gats in the club
Had to step light, like it's thumb tacs in the rug
But you still down, though a few cats is a dub
Trying to smoke something, we was really after the bud (light up)
'Cause the fly cats can't really adapt to the mud
If you ain't God it ain't in your actions to judge
It is what it is turns into it was what it was
And umm, you know the thirst come with the grub (always)
And the dirtiest is the first one in the tub
And the tough guys really just be wanting to hug
Yeah, when they calm down after they bug
And realize they just caught up in the rapture of love, what?

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
And it feels like love
And it feels like love
When it feels, oh
Drop top coupes in the winter, babe
We just moving like the winners, baby
Drinks up, if you feel the same
Ooooooh, na na na na
Oh baby, yeah, oh na
