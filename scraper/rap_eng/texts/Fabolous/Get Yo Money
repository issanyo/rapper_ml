Now I could ride through and scoop up a shooter
I find a nigga that could spot a whore like a hooper recruiter
Then I sit 'em on the stoop with the Ruger
Cause them groupie intruders'll
Rush ya spot like a group of them Lugers
I got a one, two as super as Judah's
For them niggas thats *disturbing the peace* like the group who with Luda
And I just met the connect who hit Snoop with his buddah
So I'm probably lookin as high as Jupiter to ya
Shorty say I'm cute, but in the coupe I be cuter (damn)
Explain, she gives me brain like she Superhead's tutor
On another note, she like Betty Crock
With ready rocks
Get pounds of that shit that smell like sweaty socks
But I did my share of choppin' and baggin'
Swappin' and draggin'
Poppin' the Mag in
And gotta see to believe just stop and imagine
I'm shoppin' with swag in
Poppin' them tags in (yeah)
I do alot of shit poppin' and braggin'
And flip my middle finger as I hop in the wagon nigga
I'm too fly for the hi and goodbyes
And the hate is too obvious to try to disguise
I keep my hand on my gun, my eye on the prize
High as the skies
Nah pimp I ain't suprised (come on)
I knew you would like it
Maybe I'm psychic
Thought you would love it
You know they can't get enough of it (come on)
And every verse was cold
My first one sold
And as a matter of fact my worst was gold
I'm as good as any rapper you know
Capital -L capital -O capital -S capital -O
You rappin' too slow
I laugh at ya flow
I'm about ta force niggas go back to trappin' for dough
And I grew up with the arm they be hatin' since knee high
Thats why me and Cain is like Payton and Eli (yeah)
Strong like the Clitzgos
Ball like we crazy
Splurge like skitzos
You see the way my shits froze (damn)
And its hangin' off me like icicles
I used to pedal hard but its not on bicycles (no)
This is way back when everybody would buy nickels
Nigga I was blowin' through them lincolns like the tunnel
'97 3 quarter minkin' in the tunnel
God damn you got a nigga thinkin' of them bundles
Get ya money money f*ck them broke niggas

Chump change
But it belongs to me
I don't care if its a million dollars
I don't care if its a hundred dollars
I DON'T CARE IF ITS 20 DOLLARS!
When you take something thats mine
You spit in my face
And it hurts me
