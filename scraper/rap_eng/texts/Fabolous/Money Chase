[Verse 1: Lloyd Banks]
Million dollars richer u can tell that by the picture
Coogi green twister so i'm smelling like the crop
Pop by the bucket, liquor by the pitcher
Bitches by the borough bet a bottle I'mma pop
I'm giving y'all new styles, boy don't bite that hand
You're local as your corner, they know Lloyd out Japan
I'm too ghetto in a day, bring the porno out a fan
Mr Hefner swagger on auto, I'm the man
Why your clothes still on? Girl don't turn me off
Fly nigga, reason you already know the cost
I'm a Southside nigga from 134th
Tryna hold all in my mind, fly 730 Porsche
I'm a stunner during the spring and summer
You know i got the pussy from her if i got the number
I ain't nothing but a lover, you can have her if u want her
'Cause pretty bitches ain't shit to me today i have another

[Hook]
We counting money all night, keep it G errday
Real nigga on sight, with my demons away
I got a beautiful bitch and I walk like I'm rich
Just my morals and word, I don't break em for shit
Ain't no foot on the brake, now I'm making em sick
You see the hood on my face, niggas want me to slip
Name a time and a place, I'll be in line for the race
Marijuana by the case and my mind on the money chase

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Failure's not an option, Charlie Sheen edition
Never saw em like us, you prolly seen who isn't
I'm hardly seen for dissing, I follow things up different
Masked up at your house Halloween tradition
Treat but never tricking, throw it in the bag
Bout twenty of em rose' Moets on the the tab
I'm up in perfections, where nobody's perfect
But they pay attention, cause they know I'm worth it
Cash cures ADD, that's what the study show
My Nina give it up, i love that slutty ho
Uh, running your mouth like a bloody nose
Fake rapper, who does live what he flows
Call me BBM, bad bitch magnet
If she with me she's a Fabolous ad lib... nice
Gettin' to the money, final destination, why the hesitation?

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Christian, Louie, Gucci, Coochie like it just came out
Daddy was a Mack, that suit me to take the same route
Counting money cut in coupe and that's what my day bout
Ghetto license plate says stupid, Cuban chain out
I'm shitting, and every diamonds sitting
I spend a bunch a money on the vehicle I sit in
When you start doing better, everybody treat you different
But I ain't big on attention so the shit don't got me tripping
I'm new dollars addicted, hundreds got my twitching
Cumming on your baby mama with the baby kicking
Flying down Long Island, full one eighty whipping
Pull the role reversal got the pretty ladies tricking
Blue... they don't make em like they use to do
They see me slipping suicidal C notes like the musical
Don't matter they got class, I cut em like the students do
Fuck I care, they beautiful, macking is a usual
