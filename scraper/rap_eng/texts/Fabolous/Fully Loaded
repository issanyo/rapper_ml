[Intro: Red Cafe]
She got an arch up on that thing...
Shawty healed up... Chanel bag'd up

[Hook: Red Cafe]
Shawty loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty fully loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty got ass, all the rich niggas love her
I’m from the PJs, wear my Jay’s when I fuck her
Shawty loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty fully loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty got ass, all the boss bitches love her
She from the PJ's wear my Jay’s when I fuck her

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Shawty got ass, all the bitches want her
Hallelujah I caught her, all them ballers be on her
I woke up faded, turn around and blazed it
Been like ten years, me, me and  this money, baked
I got cash overload, she got ass overload
Ciroc, by the bucket, ask give myself her, no
I might need my protein, I’m scheming out her whole team
Her ass got a purpose, so work it, work it, work it, man
That booty be on request, she never on recess
She just bout that paper, get it, girl, by no BS
Loaded, she loaded, that gas got me on Pluto
That Marley got her on Pluto, her ass fat sumo

[Hook: Red Cafe]
Shawty loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty fully loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty got ass, all the rich niggas love her
I’m from the PJs, wear my Jay’s when I fuck her
Shawty loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty fully loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty got ass, all the boss bitches love her
She from the PJ's wear my Jay’s when I fuck her

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
I cock it, now that’s one in the head
She blow it, she pop it, she busting in the bed
She busting in the chair, she busting on the stairs
We busting everywhere, shit, I’m busting in her hair
I don’t fuck with that red dot if she infra-red
Than it’s only head shots, I be giving lead shots
Always got my safety on, always make her legs lock
She ain’t never saying stop, spray me, leave a wet spot
Chopper break her down, she fall back when I swing that
Hit that and I hit that, and the guts just where I aim at
Looking at her marks-man, pussy precision
Knock that motherfucker down like it was tripping
My nigga, nigga, nigga, why you think they call me trigga fo'?
Keep that pussy busting, baby, fuck them other niggas hoe
I just get you open like the track was in the envelope
I be killing pussy, tell me, can I get a witness though?

[Hook: Red Cafe]
Shawty loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty fully loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty got ass, all the rich niggas love her
I’m from the PJs, wear my Jay’s when I fuck her
Shawty loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty fully loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty got ass, all the boss bitches love her
She from the PJ's wear my Jay’s when I fuck her

[Bridge]
You need a fully loaded bitch up in your life
You need a fully loaded bitch to be your wife
I need a fully loaded nigga on my team
I need a fully loaded nigga on my team

[Verse 3: Fabulous]
That girl be fully loaded, I keep that thing off safety
That girl be rolling with him, her nigga travel safely
That girl is something special, like that 38 be
Them hoes be throwing shots, but shawty’s catching murders lately
Your body bags, body bags, make sure they Chanel
I told her let me squeeze it, and make sure that it’s real
Got a little bitch, her friend though, it’s colt? Extendo
I told her blow her cartdridge, then I slide in that Nintendo
Ain’t gonna be no games play, just game spray, she can’t stay
Then I pull back that white sheet like oh, shit, you’re damn late
In my bed, in my head, I’m thinking salute her
Her nigga' couldn’t make a bust, she got with a shooter

[Hook: Red Cafe]
Shawty loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty fully loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty got ass, all the rich niggas love her
I’m from the PJs, wear my Jay’s when I fuck her
Shawty loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty fully loaded, loaded, loaded
Shawty got ass, all the boss bitches love her
She from the PJ's wear my Jay’s when I fuck her
Shawty loaded
