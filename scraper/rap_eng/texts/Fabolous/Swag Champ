[Verse 1]
Now I don't jerk off in public, but I been outdoing my self
Undisputed swag champ, that big H be my belt
Fresh pair of them Jordan 3′s, all black Givenchy
That snapback with that snake skin, you niggas gotta see Don C
Muthafucka we rolling with some brown skin girls and some Beyonces
Ball like this, you gon see the kind of hate Lebron see
Pop a band, throw a bill up, them strippers call me Chauncey
Look so cool in my leather jacket, they should be calling me Fonzie
But I ain't got my collar up, I just got my dollars up
Big fish see little fish, and you little niggas get swallowed up
Shouldn't have been in this shark tank, ain't my fault if I eat them
Why would I wanna join them, when I always knew I could beat them
Keep a foot on they neck, fresh pair of them wheat Timbs
Ain't no love in hip hop, but still let you eat Em
Came for the competition, but there wasn't much around
I let you kiss the ring but you’ll never touch the crown

[Hook]
Swag champ I got the belt
Swag champ I got the belt
When it's done come talk to me
You’ll see I got the B
B is for them big boys with the grown money
And bad bitches who ain't gotta spend their own money

[Verse 2]
Now I ain't come here to be playing, showtime expect me out
That hotel, that noon shit, yea I see em tryna check me out
That new chain just came in, guess what, my neck be out
Funny I be going in, everytime they let me out
Ran through that Louis store, once I blow that, check me out
Threw me 2 tees, felt like they was tryna tech me out
No discrimination, I will still sweat your sexy out
Like ‘em with that Keisha ass, but gotta have that Becky mouth
Rep my town but I’m hardly here
Gotta go in when I party here
Drinks so strong, I can barely lift em
Weed so loud, I could hardly hear
Love the way that track suit, lay on those shell toes
Money talks, you ain't got it, convo, hell no
Stick to bein’ you boy, stay on yo, velcro
Hate to see y'all bend backwards, rondo, elbow
Came for the competition but there wasn't much around
I let you kiss the ring, but you’ll never touch the crown

[Hook]
