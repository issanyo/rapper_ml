Unh. It's the duh-duh-duh-duh-duhduhduhduhduhduh-damn

[Intro]
Damn, it the way he grab on himself
Before he getting closer to you, girls be like damn
Damn, it's the wife beater
Wish you were the one in the drop top two seater
Damn, I can't blame him
If he wasn't mine shit, I would try to claim him
Cause he's so fly, I'm so fly
You play yourself if you try to deny it, damn

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm nothin' like the other brother
I got no choice but to slut her
Cause I'm in a tan six with a base gut
That look something like a nutta-butta duhduhduhduh
Mami you'll be in St. Tropez
Riding jet skis and mopeds, nodding like dopeheads
Paparazzi snapping pictures, they must think you J. Lopez (bitch)
Let's roast in spinach, hit a club and just post up in it
What you mean are we here yet?
I got a lear jet that gets to the west coast in minutes (hehe)
I'm smoother than white vanilla fudge and white and yellow studs
Cause if they witness how I'm killing them out here
These girls just might go tell the judge I rest my case

[Hook]
Damn, it the way he grab on himself
Before he getting closer to you, girls be like damn (you feelin that right)
Damn, it's the wife beater
Wish you were the one in the drop top two seater (come on let's ride)
Damn, I can't blame him
If he wasn't mine shit, I would try to claim him (I'm sure you would)
Cause he's so fly, I'm so fly
You play yourself if you try to deny it, damn (and what you say girl)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You could be prancing through ghettos
In Dior pants and stilettos
All you got to do is swallow some kids
Like that witch did Hansel and Gretel
Who's as handsome as ghetto?
This mans earring looks transparent
And my Mitchell & Ness throwbacks be so old
They could be somebody grandparents, baby like (Damn)
I want the kind of money athletes consume
I have to assume, I'm no fool but I'm so cool
When I walk in, it feel like it's a draft in the room, Whoo (Damn)
I'm so sick, I drive in reverse pass
Call me a nurse fast
Shorty just lay back in the Maybach
Get a feel like you sitting in first class, relax

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
They ask for it
So I put TV's in the headrest and the dashboard
You got to catch it on tape cause when the truck stops
The rims still look like they on fast-forward, unh
Damn, I'm sipping liquor the colour of Smurf skin
As long as the earth spins, and you'll get seasick
And my waves be thick enough for them Cali dudes to surf in, cowabunga!
Your low riding denims look like midgets is hiding in them
They say I like it from the front, they like it from the back
But when the kids is sliding in them, they be screaming (Damn)
The biggest dykes these switching for dudes for figures like me
And um I'm not bragging
But imagine that you could even fuck with a nigga like me

[Hook]
