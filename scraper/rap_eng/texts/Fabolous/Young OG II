[Chorus: Abir Haronni]
Troubled tears, they'll land you here
Open your eyes it's all a disguise
The fear that you feel is not real, not real
The fear that you feel is not real, no
Similar sky, similar ties
But I know all about you, I do

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
It's not real, yeah... look
The saddest stories comes from those who once had the glory
Had the forei's, diamond watches and the baddest shorties
Now they in their latter 40's, bunch of kids, scattered shorties
No respect from the neglect, they call they daddy Corey
I'm from a different cloth, that ain't the pattern for me
There's levels to this shit, it's different categories
Can't be like these niggas out here, lookin' fat and gaudy
They ain't never won no rings, but be mad at Horry
Talkin' 'bout, "Man that nigga don't deserve that shit"
Like, "I was really in these streets, I used to serve that shit"
We started from the bottom, had to topsy-turn that shit
Get it while the getting's good after that preserve that shit
My ex texted me last night, but I curve that shit
Coulda end up hittin' it, be too late to swerve that shit
That's a young mistake, Lord knows I made me some
I love gettin' brain, that never made me dumb
All that did was made me cum, swear these hoes made me numb
Only feelings for this bitch, you been shoulda gave me some
I knew some niggas who had some bread never gave me crumbs
Drank the whole fuckin' juice and never saved me some
I know how young niggas feel, I had to live through shit
See the world as constipated, nobody gon' give you shit
I learned that niggas gon' be niggas, yeah we shouldn't do it
But hoes gon' be hoes, they just ain't admittin' to it
Where I been? Gettin' to it, goin' through and gettin' through it
Runnin' round killin' shit and tellin' cops, "I didn't do it"
That's why they call me "Young OG"
And I'ma spit this dope shit until my tongue OD
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG
She got me chillin' in my city but my lungs OT, yeah
And fuck them niggas online, reply why
Broke niggas talkin', 'cause it's free Wi-Fi, yeah

[Chorus: Abir Haronni]
Troubled tears, they'll land you here
Open your eyes it's all a disguise
The fear that you feel is not real, not real
The fear that you feel is not real, no
Similar sky, similar ties
But I know all about you, I do

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Yeah, haha
My son gon' be a king, I tell him every morning
I put my chain on his neck, right now it's heavy on him
One day it'll all be his, so I'm forever on him
I test him all the time and I never warn him
I pop quiz him like stop, listen and drop wisdom
Pops vision; the bottom's crowded, the top isn't
We talk guap missions, cops, prison
I help him see it clearly, I'm his life optician
Could learn from my experience but youngin' gotta live
Just not with that mentality, that something gotta give
'Cause that's how we grew up, probably should've picked for boogers
Nah, we was on them streets, juggin' for that mugger
Still, scared that you still could get killed
That fear that you feel was that real
But I'm there like, "I will not get killed"
So that fear that I feel is not real, boy
I'm a true King, tryna raise a new king
I wanna show him stuff, teach him how to do things
How to ride a bike, how to tie his shoe strings
How to be a man, how to treat his boo thing
Gotta have the OG, give you that "Go 'head"
I don't blame you niggas, I blame your old head
I know all about that, my poppa wasn't down
Poppa used to come through, poppa doesn't now
Shoulda' protected me, but poppa wasn't 'round
So now I got this 9, that pop-a-dozen round
Them kids grow up quick, usually grow you up too
Turn you to a big dog, that's what havin' pups do
Did a lot, but I know I ain't done yet
Before it goes down, I make sure that my son set
You made so strong, you made this whole song
You made me Young OG, love you Johan

[Chorus: Abir Haronni]
Troubled tears, they'll land you here
Open your eyes it's all a disguise
The fear that you feel is not real, not real
The fear that you feel is not real, no
Similar sky, similar ties
But I know all about you, I do

[Outro: Abir Haronni]
I do...
