[Hook - Jeremih]
Go hard today
Can't worry about the past cause that yesterday
I'mma put it on the line cause it's my time
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Gotta stay on my grind cause it's my time

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Guess what time it is? My, my, my time
You can check your iPhone, better say it's iTime
I don't even need a watch, I don't even see a clock
Soon as a I walk in, it feel like me o'clock
Yeah, me o'clock, every time I check
Niggas don't measure up and try to blame the Pyrex
I'm a do it bigger than a 5X
Can't ride with a L, so I don't drive Lex
Game's so bickery, so full of trickery
Nursery-rhyming: hickory, dickory
Blowing that sour, the hood call it "pickery"
Biggie, Puffy, Busta, victory

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
My time's more like fly time
Don't call it "getting dressed", call it in the "sky time"
If you ain't a pilot, you probably couldn't style it
Unless you was a stewardess, you won't know what to do with this
First I took the time out, then I put the time in
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing
So I got the Audemars, flawless diamonds
In other words that's called perfect timing
I feel like a favor, I feel like a savior
They clocking my neck: I feel like I'm Flavor
I go so hard, Loso God, damn
Street fi-di-di-di-damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Jeremih]
0-9, all mines
It's been a few years, now it's me, about time
You know I got committed with it since I've been up in the zone
Sign the dotted line, now it's on
So y'all better check your wrist-piece
Cause it's time to make history
Just hop in here up on this hit streak
How the, how the, how the hell you gonna evict me?
You know I'm here to stay, never clocking out
Big bottles we popping now, no telling where we stopping now
And I represent the Chic-a-g-o
On the track with F-A-B-O
