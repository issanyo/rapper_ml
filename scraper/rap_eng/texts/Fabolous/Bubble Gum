[Fabolous]
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some

[Verse One: Fabolous]
Ma you better off coming with a Anna Nicole plan, tryna get ya hand on a old man
Maybe he's plannin' to romance, hand you a gold band and spend a couple grand on a po dance
...When it comes to splurgin chips, I'm tighter than virgin lips
If there's some who like to trick, who like a chick
And +come out the pocket like Michael Vick+
Or some who want a patient man
....or go with a payment plan
...wanna go to department stores
Then they want the keys to your apartment door
Nowadays a girl'll come with a price tag
And give it up for nice shoes and a nice bag
+they must have bumped their head, give them an ice bag+
And i ain't thirst, but show em.....

[Chorus: Fabolous]
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
And guess what, im fresh out of bubble gum
But i happen to have a whole lotta dick and a whole lotta chicks
Who wanna get sum
Hurry up if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
Now a chick who gold dig, look for a nigga who roll big
Rather than a nigga who hold gigs
Unless you bring her what you bringin home
Keep her finger with the bling and chrome
She try ta cling on everything you own
Even singin on them ringin tones
I rather be single and swing alone
+before you do me like ginger did sam+
+they catch you if they can like the ginger bread man+
But i know it's all about the benjamins mam
And maybe another man responds to you
At the most i could get you in the ???
Cause im not interested in buyin a chick
But you can call me about tryin ta dick
1-800-GIT-SUM....
.......
....

[Chorus: Fabolous]
All I got is hard dick and bubble gum
And guess what, im fresh out of bubble gum
But i happen to have a whole lotta dick and a whole lotta chicks
Who wanna get sum
Hurry up if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some
Hurry up girl if you wanna get some

Thats right im gettin money, and you ain't gon git it from me
???????????? ????????

[Verse Three: Fabolous]
Most of them frontin like players, they nothin but haters
Who really dont want a fella to know
They spend they paycheques in the ??? ???
They suckin up nuts like the elephant yo
After one night stands, you hadn't seen them since
Till they came to court ??? ???? ?? ??? ?? ?
Now a diamonds be a flawless ???
??? ?? ?? ? ?? ? ? ? ?? ?
Nigga, you on welfare, you ???? bills and you need health care
