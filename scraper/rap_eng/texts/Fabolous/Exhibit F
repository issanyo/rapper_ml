[Intro: Fabolous]
Its so sad
But I would like to thank everyone who came along, to the funeral service
Somehow, someway, we will find a way to move on
As we proceed, to give you what you need
2010 mothafuckas
Bring that money in mothafuckas
Everything comes to an end
And therefore, I bring you, Exhibit F

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
One day Im gon be sleepin' in a box
But when that time comes, it comes
Ain't no need to keep peepin' at the clocks
The hood is like an anchor,think deeper than them blocks
My boat was made to float, not for keepin' at the docks
They sweepin' through the blocks
Slam you on the floor, for what you keepin' in your socks
16 year olds be sleepin' with their Glocks
I tried to tell him chill, just keep it on them rocks
He looked at me and transformed
Thats like making sand castles, in a sandstorm
He said its a cold world, not the sandstorm
But the heat's the only way I keep my hands warm
I told the lil nigga God got a plan for 'em
He said im Hollywood, go back where they plant palms
This the jungle bro, this ain't no fuckin' ant farm
And out here, life's a bitch that you can't charm
Damn, that's the realest shit I ever heard
Sometimes a dumb ass drops a clever turd
Smokin' sour diesel from 173rd
I'm bout fly shit, so if I ever bird
I can't fly with pigeons, gotta soar with eagles
A wise man told me, vultures don't war with seagulls
If looks could kill, ain't a nigga more illegal
Closet lookin' like you walk through the door at Segal's
Spot they sell clothes, Crescent & Melrose
I run d mc's, check my shelltoes
I'm on the red carpet, takin' pics jail pose
I see through your bars nigga, the cells closed

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Know what
They call me Fab Electronica
Presedential suite, so it's Fab and young Monica
Stevie Wonder niggas better grab ya harmonica
Screamin' go daddy, so its Fab and young Donica
Shit, I mean Danica
Pockets full of Benjamins, Franklin not Banneker
Thick as a Brittanica
Death comes to all, when it comes, don't panic bruh
If it goes down, stay on ya Titanic bruh
Never jump ship nigga
You know I'm packin' if we ever bump hips nigga
I'm Jive Records, I dump clips nigga
Count it , or cock it, I'm a thumb tip nigga
We eatin' over here, check my crumb lips nigga
I wipe my mouth, right before I wipe 'em out
Shootin' videos, thats what niggas hype about
Shit, we makin' movies, introducin' Fab Pitt
Crush stations, only time I deal with crab shit
This the funeral, sit back and reminisce
You should be cryin' by the end of this
NICE
