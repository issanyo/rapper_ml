[Verse 1: Paul Cain & Broadway]
Damn Ma
I love you like the lye
I get a rush from your touch, sort of like a high
I used to adore your presence but now I'm like goodbye
Kept it a hundred with you..What gave you the right to lie?
We in two different spaces, and you done turned Gemini
Completely changed faces
You wouldn't understand even if we trade places
You'll never find another me, face it!
My life ain't sweet
I don't know who told you that?
My shoes, might want to tiptoe in that
Walk slow with that
I'm the same, ain't changed
But the haters where home is at
Got me like damn
Where my homies at
Fuck it, it's just me
Can't hold me back
You just can't bite the hand that feeds you
Especially when the hand's illegal
I guess you could
Consider it a lesson learned
I'm guessing it was just my turn
To learn the hard way
You can't always trust the ones you love

[Chorus]
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah... ahh probably not
You look so familiar too..
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry, I must have you confused

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
You got to take the good with the bad
Love what you got, remember what you had
Always forgive but never forget
Learn from mistakes, but never regret
I feel like it's coming it just ain't evident yet
You wanna take off, go head rev up the jet
Ain't gotta act like our paths should never have met
Let's be happy apart instead of together upset
I got the least out of something I put the most into
It's fucked up when assholes are who we toasting to
You remind me of somebody that I used to know
Me and that other you weren't introduced before
And I don't like that bitch
Rico from Belly voice
"I don't like that shit"
Who's gonna fill your space
That's still a case
Ben Franks the only familiar face
Get money

[Chorus]
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah... ahh probably not
You look so familiar too..
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry, I must have you confused

[Verse 4: Paul Cain]
I guess she forgot how I used to hold her
The nights she was goin through it
Crying on my shoulder
And did a 360 it's like she got colder
I'm starting to regret all the things that I showed her
But I'm a rider
She used to be my roller
I guess the general just lost his best soldier
I thought I felt some type of bond and got close to her
She be Demi Moore
Cuz ya boy a ghost to her

[Chorus]
Oh yeah I think I remember you
Yeah... ahh probably not
You look so familiar too..
But you just wouldn't do this to me
I know you just wouldn't do this to me
Not you, I'm sorry, I must have you confused
