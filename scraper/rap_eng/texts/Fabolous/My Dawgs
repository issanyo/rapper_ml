[Hook 2x]
What the fuck we gon' do with all this money
What the fuck we gon' do with all these hundreds
I'm gon' spend 'em with my dawgs
And I'm gon' spend 'em with my dawgs

[Verse 1 (Mally)]
I said they come through with 'em kilo
Nigga I ain't playin' I got the money I'll pay ya
Nigga I'm just sayin' I'm bundled up with that paper
Nigga got Talla Benz, we blowin' up and outweigh her
Niggas never understand I been the man, and I been the man, with that fly shit that yo bitch is on
She come through and she fuck good, and she talk cash, we get along
Whenever she shinin', it might blind 'em, when they [?]
I told my momma it's no problem, her son got her, I'll set 'em off
I'll set 'em off, I'll dead 'em all

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 2 (Mike Davis)]
I said I come through with that chaos
Nigga that's too sick and I'm flexin' hard so just pay up
Nigga I'm too rich and I'm 20 now so playa
Nigga got 2 bitches, got 2 bottles of flaya
Nigga that's too sick and I'm too high, and I'm too fly and I'm so wasted I set 'em off
Vacation, no playstation, no playin' games, [?]
Make paper, don't fake faith to get [?]
Make a snake's face to go to any of 'em niggas for that fake shit they set 'em off
I set 'em off, I set 'em off

[Hook 2x]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Said I come through with that paper (go with that paper)
Nigga that ain't news, I either win or I learn from it (nigga we win)
Nigga I can't lose, your homie keep it so playa (niggas don't play)
Nigga need a contract, you can call my team the Rosayas (bottles on the way)
Niggas need done caps, and I'm shinin' where, who I was grindin' with
Nigga I ain't changin' and we ain't changin'
Got new trucks, nigga rearranging, got chicks naggin' and she ain't changin'
I'm paper-chasin', you paper-hatin' on this fly shit, we the pie nigga
We in the building, my whole circle done step it up, like spiral stairs
Ain't trippin' though, ain't trippin' but
