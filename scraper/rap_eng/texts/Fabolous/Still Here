[Hook: Red Cafe]
Could have been anywhere else in the world but we still here
I done lost a couple of my homies in the hood but we still here
So when they see me they see you like I'm still here
It could have been anywhere else in the world like here
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I said na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, Shakedown
Could have been anywhere else in the world but we here

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
You told me not to trust 'em, they ain't nothing like us
I should have listened to ya, we hustle lately for luck
What else, it's death before dishonor where I come from
Loyalty before royalty where I come from
I'ma rep for ya like I'm right next to ya
Still locked in my phone tryna send a text to ya
Man we still right here stunting like ya never left
Yeah, I yeah uhh
They running round with fake jewels
Disrespecting God, fugazi  they hate Jesus
The lil' Bullet just graduated
I bought a crib in Dubai, these haters they aggravating

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Could have been anywhere else in the world but we still here
I done lost a couple of my homies in the hood but we still here
So when they see me they see you like I'm still here
It could have been anywhere else in the world like here
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I said na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Could have been anywhere else in the world but we here

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
Forever rep my daughters, gone us its on light
Blowing loud, that yet is on the night
They kill for the drug
They kill for the money
They killing over these slides, they for errybody dummie
I do this here for my niggas
I do this here for my kids
These suckas don't wanna work, they just holla can I live
Kill yourself son, do us all a favor
Put my life on the line the day I got the paper
R.I.P. Chinx, Bullet and my pops
Big Pop, Stack and homies killed from the cops
I done lost more homies than veterans in Iraq
I ain't proud of it, I'm just stating the facts (Shakedown)

[Hook: Red Cafe]
Could have been anywhere else in the world but we still here
I done lost a couple of my homies in the hood but we still here
So when they see me they see you like you still here
It could have been anywhere else in the world but we here
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
I said na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Could have been anywhere else in the world but we here
