[Fabolous' Verse]
You niggas are comical, who me
I'm seven digits two commacal on my mama fool
I'm getting this money and that kill'em
They looking at a pimp funny I'm Katt Williams
Money Mike, I gets money on the mic
And some say I'm wild'n out
Bargadi styling out, pushing seven digits dialing
But i ain't gotta f**king choice
My money talks in a Chris Tucker voice
"And you know this man"
You a stand up rapper, hip hop comedian
I start laughing as soon as i put your CD in
You joke, you joke, you kid, you kid
Should have went to Comedy Central with the vids you did
But ok, you B.E.T. only if its Comic View
Promise you I'm funny style I can be a comic too
I'm Marty Mar, at a Auty Mar
Cute snotty broad, tits like Dolly Par
Ed Harty naw this is carty ma
But that was a good one, Hardy har
Lambo Galardi car getting my last laugh HAW

[Chorus]

[Pusha T's Verse]
The jokes on you niggas
See the figures don't add up to the claims
You Sam Kinnison you just screaming names
My brother my partner for real like the Wayans
Plus everything in live In Living Color
High rise checks diamonds the size of Robin Harris'
I Bebe Kids my neck
You call it a tribute, a ?? distribute
Sales was slow i got Paco to contribute
Some morals in each state, move weight, get caught
Don't talk, Dave Chappelle niggas might break
So hilarious, how the chariots, carry us
Phantom is light gray sort of like Ashy Larry is
King of the one liner lil' rhymers watch what you say
You just a potty mouth like Andrew Dice Clay
I pop collars on niggas, i drop dollars on niggas
I jell O's together i Bill Cosby on niggas
Got you lost in the smoke i Micheal Connelly you niggas
I watch u verse from the fire i Richard Pryor you niggas
Said enough nigga sort of like Kramer
I'm joking you don't wanna see the anger Fab tell'em

[Chorus]

[Fabolous' Verse 2]
Mane look, the diamonds in your chain look
Funnier than Dane Cook, you hit the Sufi
I am to fly, in the booth I
Make joke of them, i ain't the richest nigga but i ain't broke as them
I'm serious, petty worth will make a man delirious like Eddie Murph
Girls get curious
Is he really funny, don't be silly honey
I'm the burner packing
Bernie Macing
I ain't scared of you maf**kers kick ass
Hon stack thick ass
A deck of card VIP section hard
They try to holla at me you know the heckler broads
I'm popping Rose, I don't the neck to God
Don't front yo, i be in the front row
Watch your wise cracks or i'll be at your front door
And i push up on a female smoothly, in a GL but keep that on the D.L. Hughley
LOL this is LOS
O no your money coming so slow guess this maf**kers a no show, Oh oh oh

[Chorus]
