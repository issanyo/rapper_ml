[Intro: Teyana Taylor]
I got something to say, no
You gon' listen today, no

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor (Jadakiss)]
Can we talk about the lives being taken?
Can we talk about the guns going off and the false accusations?
I'm afraid of my own generation, can we talk about it? No
Can we talk, can we talk 'bout the blood on the pavement?
I bet they gon' be afraid to play this song on rotation
But I'ma talk about it, well, I'ma talk about it
Baby, can we talk about it? Hey, oh no
(Yup, we most certainly can) Can we talk about it?
(And I ain't gon' take too much of your time) no, no

[Verse 1: Jadakiss]
Yeah, first thing they say is stop killing
But can we talk about the cop killings?
Before we talk about the crack dealing
They acting like blacks ain't got feelings
Knowledge of self is through wisdom
So can we talk about the school system?
Young girls raped and knocked up
Will Hillary release niggas that Bill locked up?
Can we talk about the cost of living?
We can talk about guns, but we forced to get 'em
It's a new race every time you cross the ribbon
Might've skipped the beat, but we never lost the rhythm
You don't understand, so you ain't able to feel it
When my momma's in pain, I ain't able to heal it
Fatigues and field boots, the outerwear
Sponsor what? Vote for who? Fuck outta here

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor (Fabolous)]
Can we talk about the lives being taken?
Can we talk about the guns going off and the false accusations?
I'm afraid of my own generation, can we talk about it? No
Can we talk, can we talk 'bout the blood on the pavement?
I bet they gon' be afraid to play this song on rotation
But I'ma talk about it, well I'ma talk about it, baby
Can we talk about it? (We can't remain silent)
Can we talk about it? (We gotta speak up)
Can we talk about it? (They say it's justice)
Can we talk about it? (I feel like it's just us)

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Look, I know y'all tired of talking and going to demonstrations
But if we don't speak up, you help the discrimination
We need a one-on-one before it's goes gun on gun
People skip the front page, 'til they see they son on one
And now it's too late to talk, the topic has changed
They shooting at black targets like these cops at a range
Can we talk how many died for the birth of a nation?
And how this national anthem ain't worth my ovation?
And if I am standing up, I'ma stand up for equality
It's brutality, we need more than that apology
Can we talk about it? Not just artists, but the players too
Y'all on the field, not the mic, but y'all can say it too
We need more Kaepernicking, not just what the rapper kicking
We need more than Instagram posts with smart captions
Black actors, stop acting and start action
Kerr got the credit, forgot about Mark Jackson, damn

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor (Jadakiss)]
Can we talk about the lives being taken?
Can we talk about the guns going off and the false accusations?
I'm afraid of my own generation, can we talk about it? No
Can we talk, can we talk 'bout the blood on the pavement?
I bet they gon' be afraid to play this song on rotation
But I'ma talk about it, well I'ma talk about it, baby
Can we talk about it? (Ahem)
Can we talk about it?
Can we talk about it? (May I have your attention, please)
Can we talk about it?

[Verse 3: Fabolous & Jadakiss]
Sensitive subject, but can we talk about it? Yeah
Step straight to it, not try to walk around it? Nah
How we make America great again? How?
If we open up the doors and let haters in, wow!
It's nothing, we winners
But that could all change, since Trump won, we finished
Much realer than we thought
I'm saying, all I really wanna know is can we talk?

[Outro: Teyana Taylor]
Can we talk for a minute?
I just want to know, know, know
Can we talk for a minute?
I gotta know right now, yeah
Can we talk about it?
Can we talk about it?
Can we talk about it?
Can we talk about it?
