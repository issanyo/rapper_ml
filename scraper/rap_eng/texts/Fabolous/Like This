Might pop some tags
But you was never fly like this

Make a 36D from a A cup bitch
Sleep with me you might wake up with (with what)
A set of keys to a pad and a Jag
Fendi spas Paddington bags
Cockiness to add in ya swag
Take a look at what you had and then gag

Uh Roc-A-Fella
Black people usin' black cars isn't it ironic?
Smokin' weed on the yacht isn't it the chronic?
Plus the hoes good
Its feelin' like rose wood
That plus all the bullshit we on it
Cops'll pull you over like isn't there a problem?
No sir
But I realize the windows so blur
That you might've mistaked a nigga for a chauffer
Ya might mistake that backseat for a sofur (sofa)
Now the dreads said to rap on everything
Cause he know that I snap on everything
Listen, when my flow commisions
It caused the commisioner to throw a cap on everything
My accountant said

Right beside the fountain
And decide on the Phantom

Matter fact whoever the dick riders is
Get your own style don't Winona Ryder his
Ferrari Fab or you could say Spyder Spizz
SLR pullin up on the side of his
Shortys success ain't even near as hot as his
This dudes paper thinner than Easy Wadha is

But if you do the math though
I've been gettin money since Kojak had a afro
I've been fresh since
Will Smith was a Fresh Prince
Had hoes when Kermit was a tadpole
So of course the officers wanna off us
Came off the corner to up in the corner office

Where the hell all of ya'll been?
