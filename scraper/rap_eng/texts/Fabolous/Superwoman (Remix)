[Fabolous]
I guess I ain't got no reason to mingle 'round
I found a superwoman
That can leap from the truck in a single bound
Mami I'm tryna bling you down
So niggas without shades on
Can't stare when I bring you 'round
She put her lips on the weed
And pull it to work her tongue
And make me cum faster than a speeding bullet
Her love's stronger than a locomotive
But only for the F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
Sing to me ma

1 - Baby they can't play you
Cause I'll save you with my superpowers
Boy I'm only human
But I'll be your superwoman

They don't make any girls like me, no, no
Take a girl like to me to get
A guy like you to understand how girls ain't the same
I'm not your average chick
Cause they can't do it like this
I've been sent to save your day
And things won't be the same

Repeat 1

Uh, boy I told you once before
You ain't gotta look up in the sky
Cause the girl you need is right before your eyes
Yes I'm sick of all these broads
Ain't got nothing to stand for
Cause with me you won't fall off, no baby oh

Repeat 1

Everyday, everyday
I'll love you in a special way
Chickenheads they can't stay
Now that I'm here, I'm here, I'm here

[Fabolous]
Uh yo this superwoman might have saved my day
Them skeeos I might have gave some play
Now I wouldn't even wave that way
I understand why them other chicks behave that way
They see the icey S on your chest engraved in gray
Be whipped I might
Cause usually with my chips I'm tight
But only green I keep from you, is kryptonite
The way that blue and red suit fits your hips so right
I be like duh-duh-duh-duh, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh DAMN
It's like I'm under your spell
If feelin' you is a crime
They gon have to put me under the jail
You probably hear the details that I be in everything
From leers to CL's to my share of females
But you know I care for you
And anytime this nigga's there for you
This feelings I only share for you
This makes it a little more clear for you that...

Repeat 1
