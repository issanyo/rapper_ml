[Intro: Will Smith from The Pursuit of Happyness]
Hey. Don't ever let somebody tell you... you can't do something
Not even me, alright?
(Alright) You got a dream... you gotta protect it
People can't do somethin themselves
They wanna tell you, you can't do it
You want somethin, go get it, period...

[Verse: Fabolous]
Look, I been down this road before
Made it through with no detour
Where I'm from we go to war, not them tweets @Soulja Boy
Load up mine you load up yours
What we need them soldiers for? (huh)
Ride like I ain't rode before
I changed the name you know me for (huh)
You know me for, girls at the house, Facts of Life (for real)
Never Hollywood, I'm not about that actor life (for real)
I barely ask at all, never had to ask 'em twice (never)
It's just however do I want it, then it's Back to Life (ha)
Don't call my phone when she come home, nigga ask ya wife
I killed the pussy, she came back to you, in the afterlife (it mean she came back)
You wanna share your thoughts, okay just be mindful that (check this out)
Click-click-bang, "Ain't Nobody Got Time for That"
Sweet Brown shit (uh huh), on some Sweet Brown shit (uh huh)
Lord Jesus, it's a fire when I heat down shit (Lord Jesus, it's a fire)
Yeah, lettin' people take advantage ain't my style at all (nah)
You'd rather ask Bill Cosby for a Tylenol (wooooooo!!!)
On some real shit, I just want some real shit (yeah)
On some real shit, she just want some real shit
On some real shit, we just want some real shit
Now watch the family get this money (nigga), Will Smith
Will Smith, w-w, Will Smith

Will Smith, w-w, Will Smith
Now watch the family get this money, Will Smith (yeah)
