[Verse 1: Ransom]
I've been having some deep thoughts with that L blowing
Niggas in jail knowing
When you do it, do it yourself
And never tell no one
You see them shells blowing
I'll go to hell knowing
That I had them eagles sit em down like Terrell Owens
I spell evil backwards
I gotta live
If money's the root of evil
Then fuck it I'm an evil bastard
You know that diesel acid
When it reach the masses
I swear to God it'll burn
Turn the streets to ashes
Dope in the Charger
Still smoking L's laughin
I'm coaching the carter
Call me Samuel Jackson
Nigga's been fags
Funny like Sinbad
Me, I'm from the hood
My life saving's in a gym bag
I'm flaming the forty
I ain't even sorry
If you're with your kid
Then I'll put your brain on your shorty
I ain't open that damn Glock for the fame and the glory
I was hoping to jam rocks like Damien Marley

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Hey yo, I'm living better
Second letter with a set of wings
Butter leather
Hoodie sweater and some better bling
Black Beretta
These niggas better not have said a thing
For that cheddar I'm not a forgetter or regret a thing
I could get her
Don't have to sweat in order to get her things
I'll forget her
It feel better just to let her cling
When you met her she was better than Coretta King
Ya'll lived together
She was gonna get a wedding ring
She chose me and blows me like she owes me
You know me
I take whatever life throws me
Shows me
Girls don't like boys
They like cars, money and some of that good smoke
Kush jars and twenty
Tell a few good jokes
But it's far from funny
When you in the hood broke
You see I understand what make niggas underhand
So I put a hundred grand just to put you on the lam
This ain't what you wanted man

[Verse 3: Paul Cain]
I'm a problem for every rapper breathing
On every track I'm meeting
It's a fact
I'mma be factor in rap this season
I pull my strap and squeeze it
Coming with a pack of demons
That'll leave the pastor bleeding
You ain't gotta ask the reason
I know what Shaq was scheming
You can see the tiger stripe J from a mile away
Yellow, white, and glasses gleaming
Chain so sick
I don't need a piece for it
I can hear the streets talking
I dare you to reach for it
I'm strapped
If you look closely you can see the torrents
Hate niggas that keep talking
They usually be informants
That Brooklyn bullshit
You better believe I'm on it
You know if I mean I bought it
Flow sick, put G's up on it
And naw
I don't get along with these rapping cats
They mad my chain's the same size as their platinum plaques
Thats a fact
Let me get mine first, then after that
I'm completely done with rap
You cats can have it back

[Verse 4: Stack Bundles]
Had a Hummer and Range Sport thoughts for the winner
Summer thoughts for the winter
It's Long John weather
Fiends come with shorts in the winter
Shoveled snow in the winter
Hope you're getting my drift
You should hold your head back when you get in a drip, drip
A little grip
I could cover the order
Wanna floss, I'm a boss
I'll confront you, recorder
See the cross all flooded
Little stones on the border
And I just got a divorce
So I'm looking for Run's daughter
Tell the rev that I'm dealing with some evils
The sun shine on em cause the coup ceiling's see-through
Dainty women, Antique denim
His pockets gotta be nauseous
The man's keep spending
Tricking on niggas
Throw a little kitty on em
My niggas will sic em and empty out the semis on them
You'd rather spit on God than go against him
Ain't no second guessing
It's SQUAD UP convinced em

[Verse 5: Jaz]
They can't take me in the dark grey Jag
Seats the same leather as the Mark Jake bag
But Jaz the kind of bitch that the narcs may tag
Cause I'm bringing the kind of butter like Parkay had
And no, I ain't the ho that want a nickel to earn
The street bitch need a stack that's as thick as a curve
And you might catch a chick in the burbs
Maybe cause I'm, nice with the nouns
And slick with the verbs, yeah
It's Ms. Jizzaz
Fizzaz and spizzaz
I'm like Betty Shabizzaz
With a little pizzaz
I wasn't sworn in just to join in
Been family since the morning that I was born in
And getting money is hereditary
That California kush got my eyes red as cherries
These bitches waiting on they next pay day
I'm in a XK-8
With the body of an ex-Playmate
And I'm still holding the SK straight, nigga
