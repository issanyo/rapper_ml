[Fabolous & Ne-Yo Speaking]
Timboe
Hey... Ne-Yo
Loso...
Hey, Hey...

[Chorus]
[Ne-Yo]
I'm a movement by myself
But I'm a voice when we're together
Mami I'm good all by myself
But baby u make me better
U make me better (X8)

[Verse 1]
[Fabolous]
You plus me it equals better math
Your boy a good look but she my better half
I'm already bossing already flossing
But why have the cake if it ain't got the sweet frosting?
(Yep, yep, yep, yep) Keeping me on my A game
(Wit, wit, wit, wit) Without having the same name
(They, they, they, they, they) They may flame
(But, but, but, but) But shorty we burn it up
The sag in my swag, pep in my step
Daddy do the Gucci, mami in Giuseppe's
Yes, it's a G thang, Whenever we swing
I'ma need Coretta Scott if I'm gonna be king

[Chorus]
[Ne-Yo]
I'm a movement by myself
But I'm a voice when we're together
Mami I'm good all by myself
But baby u make me better
U make me better (X8)

[Verse 2]
[Ne-Yo]
1st things 1st, I does what I do
But everything I am she's my influence
I'm already bossin I'm already fly
But if I'm a star, she is the sky
(I, I, I) And when I feel like I'm on top
(She, she, she) She give me reason to not stop
(And, and, and, and, and) And though I'm hot
(To, to, to) Together we burn it up
[Fabolous]
The caked up cut, the cleaned up ice
When shorty come around, I clean up nice
Dynamic duo, Batman & Robin
Whoever don't like it, it's that mans problem
(And, and, and) And when I feel like I'm tired
(My, my, my) My baby taking me higher
(I, I, I, I, I) I'm on fire
(But, but, but) But shorty we burn it up

[Chorus]
[Ne-Yo]
I'm a movement by myself
But I'm a voice when we're together
Mami I'm good all by myself
But baby u make me better
U make me better (X8)

[Bridge (Ne-Yo)]
Cuz outside every great man you can find
A woman like a soldier holding him down
[Fabolous]
She treats me like a don, watches for the hit
Checks where I go, even watches who I'm wit
The right when I'm wrong, so I never slip
Showed me how to move, that's why I never trip
And baby girl you so major
They should front page ya
God bless the parents who made ya
Middle finger anybody who hate the
Way we burn it up

[Chorus]
[Ne-Yo]
I'm a movement by myself
But I'm a voice when we're together
Mami I'm good all by myself
But baby u make me better
U make me better (X8)
[Fabolous speaking]
Yeah baby
Them lames u playin wit, they gone put u down
We trying to compliment you, you know? Make it better
Top notch pimp
Nice look Ne-Yo
Living good Loso
They ask you how u doing now, tell 'em better then them
Hahahahah

[Chorus]
[Ne-Yo]
I'm a movement by myself
But I'm a voice when we're together
Mami I'm good all by myself
But baby u make me better
U make me better (x8)
