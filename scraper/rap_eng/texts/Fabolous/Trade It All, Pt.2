[P. Diddy]
This moment they all been waitin' for, playboy
We here now
We're in the house now, for sure

[Chorus:]
[Jagged Edge]
Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

[Fabolous]
I assume I'm so into you
'Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends with you
If they ask, I ain't gotta say whom in them interviews
My sweet thing never believe them rumors that been untrue
In fact I had numerous friends is true
But you was wifey could change me into a groom in a mintue boo
Maybe my sense of humor gets into you
But girl, they can make a perfume from the scent of you
I wanna take you where it feel like June in December too
So what you think about Cancun till the winter through
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do
I put a daytime to go to Bloomies and spend with you
Like any other man I would have zoomed to the clinic too
Ma I wanna see if me and my junior's identical
A dude put a wound on the skin of you
I swear to everything that same afternoon I'll be interviewed, feel me

[Chorus:]
[Jagged Edge]
Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

[P. Diddy]
Come here, girl, come and take a walk with me
So I could take you places you don't often be
Come on, ma, come and get lost with me
As far as them other chicks, can't get 'em off-a me
Everlastin' love in a whole other fashion
All I'm askin', let me cash in
'Cause I'll give her passion, all of the Sean John flashin'
In orderly fashion perhaps when you figured out
Excatly what diddy about 'cause we can take this whole city out
Now who gon' stop us, who gon' knock us
Top us, we can't find coppers to lock us
Leer jets and choppers, love helipopers
Separate the weak from the obsolete
Me hard to keep, I gotcha
I rock ya word to big poppa I gotcha

[Chorus:]
Jagged Edge
Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

[Fabolous]
Now what you want, huh

[P. Diddy]
(I'm gonna give this all up for you, Shorty)

[Fabolous]
Now what you want, huh
Now what you want, huh, huh, huh

[Fabolous]
Yeah
Yo', this new comers known to move with the seasons
Couple winter lodges, few summer homes
And there for every uw, hum, and moan and make sure when the new hummer roams
The shoes come in chrome
I ain't know if I buy white yellow and Q'cumba stones
That would send chills threw a womans bones
But life gets grusmoe alone
Even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown
Flights I done flew some alone
Ma I wanna wake up every day with you in a new number zone
Mama Mia it's you I'ma phone
Just to erase all the negative view from your dome
And I promise this Fella G
And so gangsta it calm all that jealousy
And drama you tellin' me, so mama come yell at me
So I could put the top down and we could cruise like
Tom and Penelope my charm is a felony

[Chorus:]
[Jagged Edge]
Girl, I'd trade it all, money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Money, cars and everything
All, even give up my street dream
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all

Even give up my good green
All, and I'd give the watch and pinky ring
All, anything to have you on my team
All, baby girl, I'd trade it all
