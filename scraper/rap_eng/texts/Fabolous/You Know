[Bridge: Young Jeezy]
Fuck that shit, real niggas get fetti (fetti)
And why the fuck he ain't in the Feds already? (Hah)
And why the motherfucker ain't dead already? (Hah)
And why you ain't ran through his fucking bread already? (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Young Jeezy, Fabolous & both]
I'm the motherfucking man, nigga, all these hoes know it, know it
I ain't with the game, nigga, all my folks know it - HA-HAAAA!
Ain't a thing for my gang, nigga, all my bros know it, yeeeah
Never fronted me a thing, nigga, I'ma pay for it, hah - AY!
And you know, you know, you know, you know
You motherfuckers better act like you know
Time to talk that shit, they don't wanna see Snow
You know, yeeeeeaaaahhhh
And you know, you know, you know, you know
You motherfuckers better act like you know
Yeah, these other niggas cool, but they ain't Loso

[Verse 1: Young Jeezy]
You know you doing something right when they gossiping every night (night)
Back and forth shit niggas caught up in all the hype
Niggas don't know shit about shit
Let these motherfuckers know every chance I get
Bitch, I'm self made (that's right)
See, I pried myself then I got paid (paid)
Then I copped me a Lex, then I got laid (WOO!)
Mars tried to catch me slipping, almost got sprayed (sprayed)
They ain't playing around here, this ain't the arcade (HA-HAAAA!)
See, half of these niggas really bitch made
Talking like they open keys with a switchblade (daaamn!)
Put 'em on Netflix where them movies are (yeeeah)
Fuck you know about bricks? You a movie star (OH!)

[Chorus: Young Jeezy, Fabolous & both]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
You niggas trying to get noticed (hah), I'm here to be remembered (remember)
Came through in June, they still talking in December (remember)
Ain't no weak links over here
We all solid, nigga, we the Cuban links over here
We don't blink over here
We've seen it all and y'all ain't seen shit yet (y'all ain't seen shit)
Little niggas trying on my shoes, they don't fit yet (they don't fit)
When you get shit, guess that's how shit get (oh yeah?)
Trigger finger to your pussies, get your shit wet
Straight up, I ain't never been a slouch, nigga
And your wifey just hit me; ouch, nigga
Putting footprints all up in the couch, nigga
Shit these shoes cost more than the couch, nigga

[Bridge: Young Jeezy]
Fuck that shit, real niggas get fetti (fetti)
