[Intro/Hook]
[Fabolous/Trey Songz]
I'm ridin round and I'm gettin it
I'm ridin round and I'm gettin it
I'm ridin round and I'm gettin it
It's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it
I'm ridin round and I'm gettin it
It's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it
It's mine, I spend it

[Trey Songz]
I'm smokin on exotic, she bitching about her stomach
When we have sex she felt it in the stomach
Throw that money up, shid, make that money vomit
And when I'm with the school bitch, money was the subject

[Hook]

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
I'm ridin round through my city, emphasis on my city
This bullsht ain't gon carry on
No none of that shit fly with me
Yeah I'm back with my guy with me
That boy named Trigga Trey
We ridin round we gettin it
Maybe I stay out them niggas way
Just like the late Bigga say
More money, more problems
Matter fact I'd rather that to having no money be your problem
If hustle plus muscle equals success then it's no problem
Think I care if you fuck with me
No sir that's a ho problem
We be on the loud shit
Y'all be smoking that low volume
Over here is going down, over there ain't no slalom
I'm so fly I need a co-pilot
Need a ride but with low mileage
And all my girls be holding in the back, no wallet

[Hook]

[Trey Songz]
I'm ridin round windows up
Young peace town can't wait to fuck
Another one in the back can relate to her
Got tittes big and they fake as fuck
My niggas got em pistols I'll never catch no case bra
Life is like a strip club and I always got my paper up
Swears like a nigga can make enough
Fame for the kk beggin up
Stop it, watch it, pocket, scrap it
Niggas know I got it
Knowledge where she drop after that I take her shopping
Bitch niggas be talkin we just call it pussy poppin'
Trigga's home, where he go though? I been on what you ain't know ho
Snatch the doze up on that photo
Make that girl tattoo my logo
She go below the belt cha that's a low blow
Made her say ah and I ain't talkin coco loso

[Hook]
