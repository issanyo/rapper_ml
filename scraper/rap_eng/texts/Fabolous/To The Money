[Intro: Jam & Spoon]
Fall in love with music, fall in love with dance
Fall in love with anything that makes you want romance
Make a little something from the way that you go
Just think that everything you touch can turn to gold

[Verse 1: Broadway]
Nightmares, I’m waking up in cold sweats again
At least I’m waking up so fuck it hope it never ends
Enemies now, once was the best of friends
But I won’t sleep until I see the death of them
Toppers on d-d-d-deck, bitches on d-d-d-dick
Hustlers turn corporate, now tell me what the bizness is
Baby fucking with me you might can benefit
It’s interesting, I records days you wasn’t interested
Now you all know a nigga fly as me
Clipper, policy, rich young society
Get money, you are old and broke
I’m high off life, still rolling smoke

[Hook]
But I’ma keep on fighting, till the day I die
Make me feel alive, oh oh
I’m a one way fly to the money, money, money, money
Shout to getting money, shout to getting money
To the money, money, money, money
To the money, money, money, money

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
It’s your boy checking in, find a reservation
Non stop to this money, final destination
They say they get into it, but there’s signs of hesitation
They looking suspect without the crime investigation
Money on d-d-d-deck, haters eat d-d-d-dick
Yeah I’m all for the check, but I don’t do this for kicks
Funny, thought I was under now look love to me
But kicking was down, never been what’s up with me
What’s up with me? What’s up with you
It ain’t funny, y’all broke is a joke
I’m high off life, my focus is dough

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Broadway]
Over everything and it might not be right
But it damn sure looks like
It’s all I ever need
Bitches true… this money

[Outro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
To the money, … love right
Keep away the blue from you
Come to … sky… right
…The light on you

[Outro: Jam & Spoon]
Fall in love with music, fall in love with dance
Fall in love with anything that makes you want romance
Make a little something from the way that you go
Just think that everything you touch can turn to gold
Fall in love with music, fall in love with dance
Fall in love with anything that makes you want romance
Make a little something from the way that you go
Just think that everything you touch can turn to gold
