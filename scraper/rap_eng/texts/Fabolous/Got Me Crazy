(Fabolous)
Momma said, you know better
Yeah, the flow better
Tryna knock theirs don't make yours no better
Rode through the MIA with go-getters
Money talks niggas need Rosetta
Cause y'all don't speak it like us
Y'all don't freak it like us
They looked away but now they peeking at us
You put us any way on Earth we can adjust
Go tell your friends about it if you spend the weekend with us (Yeah!)
Shoutout to Abel
So many bottles Feezy gotta shoutout my table
You know a nigga fly ain't gotta shoutout the labels
You know I'm thoroughbred, and my pockets are stable
OK now we out

(K. Michelle)
This feels alright
And boy you got me open wide, boy you caught me by surprise
Hold up! Wait a minute!
This ain't how it's supposed to be
But you got something that I need
(And I wanna know if I let down my guard)
Don't make me regret it, 'cause I can't take a
('nother broke heart)
And I've been down this road before
(Don't let me down)
'Cause ain't no second chance with me
'Cause I done told my girls that you might be the one

(Hook K. Michelle)
I (love you too much x4) oh you drive me crazy and I keep thinkin' 'bout you baby cause there's no better love
I (love you too much x4) oh you're so amazing and I keep thinkin' 'bout you baby cause there's no better love

(Rick Ross)
You say I'm always late so happy belated
Just made bond be happy I made it (I'm back!)
And the clique is sick watch it it's highly contagious
Whole team live like the Baltimore Ravens
Left Club LIV just brought a Mercedes
20K in ones I share with the ladies
She said her best days were back when we dated
Still in the same heels but those were her favorite
Spendin' drug money but give me some credit
Sated on her "H" you know that I wet it
Went against the team I know you regret it
Lookin' at me nigga, my money confetti
In a red Wraith in the drive-thru (Wingstop)
No tints they can see me as I smile too
Ever need me I'm the one to dial to
Same one now we're sweepin' up in aisle 2

(Hook K. Michelle)
I (love you too much x4) oh you drive me crazy and I keep thinkin' 'bout you baby cause there's no better love
I (love you too much x4) oh you're so amazing and I keep thinkin' 'bout you baby cause there's no better love (x2)
