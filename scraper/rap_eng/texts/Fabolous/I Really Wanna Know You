[Jagged Edge]
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you, girl
I really wanna know your name
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you, girl
I really wanna know your name
'Cause you look so sexy; you really turn me on
Blow my mind every time I see your face
'Cause you look so sexy; you really turn me on
Blow my mind every time I see your face

[Fabolous]
And even though whatever they call you
Forever I'm loyal, do whatever to spoil you
The way you fit them jeans, seven should call you
That ass have me makin' heavy withdrawals
I'm smooth when I approach, and I stare at them stones
Make you move in with the coach, and leave them players alone
We could talk 'bout it, get a bottle, pull the cork out it
One convo, and then you in the condo

[Jagged Edge]
I've been watching you for so very long
I'm trying to get my nerve built up, and be so strong
I really wanna meet you, but I'm kinda scared
'Cause you're the kinda lady with so much class
I get my thoughts together for the very next day
But when I see you, lady, I forget what to say
Your eyes and hair, such a beautiful tone
The way you dress and walk; it really turns me on

Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you
Come and talk to me
I really wanna meet you
Can I talk to you?
I really wanna know you

[Jagged Edge]
There you are again, since finally, babe
I wanna know what it is that make you feel this way
I wish I could grab you, tell you what it means to me
You walking my way, and it really makes my day
Before I go to leave, and dream about you
I'm a single man, and I hope you are single too
But we'll see something that will set my mind free
'Cause curiosity is bugging the hell out of me, yeah

You wanna tell me your name?
I wanna play your game
You wanna tell me your name?
I wanna play your game

[Fabolous]
J.E. boys
F to the A, B
See, I catch a girl eye when I play the club
'Cause they ain't seen a diamond dance like this
Since Lisa Ray in the players club
They might say it's love, but you seen the way it rub
I would say they must've missed a couple inches, boo
I seen them heels you wearing a couple inches too
Come with me, I'll show you what a couple inches do
But first, I was hoping on
We could sit and talk
You know, get our Oprah on
And we can down martinis
Faster than Lamborghinis
At places where they only wear trunks and bikinis
I don't talk game like a sports commentator
That'll get you sex now
And a court problem later
I rather be real, 'cause even while having these mils
I'm down to earth, like gravity still
But you look so sexy
You really turn me on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on

[Jagged Edge]
I wanna know
Whoa
Whoa
Won't you tell me your name?
Oh, oh
