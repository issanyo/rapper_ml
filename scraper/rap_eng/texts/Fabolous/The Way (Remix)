[Intro: Ariana Grande]
I love the way, you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way, you make me feel
I love it, I love it

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Yeah
This chick got me feelin' some type of way
If men are dogs then I guess I be the type to stay
Feelin's grow over time
Diamonds go over time
So we gotta stop playing, no over time

[Verse 2: Ariana Grande]
You give me that kinda something
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I’m at 100
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care who sees it, babe
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way
(I love the way)
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way you love

[Verse 3: Ariana Grande]
Oh, so crazy you get my heart jumping
When you put your lips on mine
And honey it ain’t a question, (quick question)
Cause boy I know just what you like

[Pre-Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So If you need it, I got it, I got it everyday
Be your lover, your friend, you’ll find it all in me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave you
And I ain’t going nowhere cause you’re a keeper

[Chorus: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care who sees it, babe
I don’t wanna hide the way I feel when you're next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way
(I love the way)
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way you love

[Verse 4: Fabolous]
Looking good feeling better
Picture us still together
Haters see the shine
Want a jack it like chilly weather
But we ain't worry about nothin' we ain't worry about nothin'
I know you gonna ride like that car parked out front
Boy don't even talk about stuntin'
She walk out when she want
Bought them red bottoms 'cuz she ain't walked out once
And I love the way you make me feel
My thirsty ex get no refill

[Outro: Ariana Grande]
So don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got it bad boy, must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care this is it babe
I don’t want another way to feel you next to me
I love the way you make me feel
I love the way
(I love the way)
I love the way
Baby I love the way you make me feel
I love the way, the way I love you
The way I love you
The way I love you
The way I love you uh, uh uh yeah
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
The way I love you
