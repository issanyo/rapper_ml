[Intro: Mariah and Fabolous]
I can’t leave it like that
M-C, F-A-B, H-B
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets and holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie, cause I come home to you

[Chorus: Mariah]
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you

[Hook: Fabolous]
Come on Mariah and let’s get higher
Come on Mariah and let’s get higher
Hit Boy on the beat, oh yeah that’s timeless
Oh you know that’s timeless

[Verse 1: Mariah]
Baby cause your love is good
That’s why I be on it
Zoning, calling, phoning for you babe
And I dream the impossible dream
When you and I are alone

[Chorus: Mariah]
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Shorty like to vacay, do it with the hood here
Shorty like a bad boy, ask em what’s good with her
Shorty like a good shoe, shorty like a nice bag
Shorty be expensive, it shows like a price tag
Shorty swole back there, I’ma need to ice that
Shorty got the cake though, you niggas never slice that
Shorty like them Rollys, shorty know what time it is
Met a few gaysies, I showed her what a diamond is

[Chorus: Mariah]
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you

[Verse 3: Mariah]
Baby cause your love is good
That’s why I be on it
Zoning, calling, phoning for you babe
And I dream the impossible dream
When you and I are alone

[Chorus: Mariah]
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you

[Verse 4: Hit-Boy]
Money over here, we ain’t even gotta say it
Just know I’m getting money every time they play it
I ain’t got no beef but when I do I’m gon’ filet it
And it costs to be the boss so I go ahead and pay it
Cause that’s just who I am
Eating like it’s thanksgiving, not just for the fam
Picture me rolling 2 Pac and for the gram
With my Rolly in the sky, do it big baby baby

[Chorus: Mariah]
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you

They don’t mean nothing
They don’t mean nothing
They don’t mean nothing
They don’t mean nothing
They don’t mean nothing
They don’t mean nothing
Baby are you

[Chorus: Mariah]
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you
Money, this, that, the other
Don’t mean nothing other than
Jets on holidays and
Chefs with hollandaise
Expensive lingerie
Cause I come home to you
