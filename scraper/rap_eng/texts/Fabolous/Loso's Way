[Intro]
Everyday I want you to remember one thing!
You still alive, cause of me...

[Verse 1]
Straight out of Brooklyn a baby mama fucker named Ghetto
Invisible set glow
Full clip to let go
Back in the metro
Fresh off the jet though
Fifty grand, richer from a thirty minute set show
Gangsta but I'm the flyest you ever met hoe
Button up etro
The Air Jordan Retro
Million dollar neck row
Got niggas upset so
Now I get the bank and make them petty niggas bet mo'
Told you from the get go
Ya'll can't deny it
I just supply it
For those who buy it
Now I ride by it
It might start a riot
Chicks won't quiet
Long enough to try it
Fuck dirt they throwin' mud slides on my name
They never seen this kind of stud size in a chain
I analyze that like I'm Billy Crystal
I'm forced to move around with this nine milly pistol
And tell Mason, I got his name on a shell casin'
And meanwhile, a nigga's multi million cell chasin
You chumps wanna see the kid in a cell pacin
You can't get back, the time you jail wastin
Im livin for the moment, 100 to own it
Expensive, but this shit look good, dont it?
YUP! Ya boys is back like a spinal cord
Got every Dj spinnin the vinyl hard
Im with this lightskin damnit albino broad
I told her 'easy you can't pull on the vinyl hard
On occasion, it pop like champagne
A clinton scandal couldn't stop my campaign
I got the peoples votes, stack'a dead people notes
You in a cheaper boat, still can't keep afloat
I'm used to the hatin, maybe niggas do it for the rooster they datin
Wanna boost in they ratings, and ya self them niggas ridin dub deuces relatin'
If I catch em imma hang, the nooses is waiting
And no lie, my best friend is 4-5
For a check I be at ya neck like a bow tie
So I blow by, catchin ya hoe eye
Dro high, got me singin 'No woman, no cry'
L dot O dot S dot O, everywhere you not hoe, ain't hard to spot yo
Bracelet on the wrist got a 40 watt glow
Quatro Quatro, ready to let a shot go
You can't touch me, I'm delicate as China
They see the S F & think a fella with the Niners
One phone call I make dem fellas get behind ya
And everybody knows that the fella is vagina
And we came to fuck ya so bend over man
And get this gang bang by The Fitititaaaam
