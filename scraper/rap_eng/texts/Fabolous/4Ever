Baby, I'm at the point at my life
And I'm tired of playing games
I'm ready to settle down
I'm ready to buy a house
And I'm ready to change my last name

Ready for the life to live
And all love has to give

Ready to be your wife

Slidin from weddings with bands on
Headin to San Juan, gettin our tan on
Girl, you must be forgettin your man's long
Most tuxes I have trouble gettin the pants on
And I know things run through your head when your man's gone

We upsettin they plans on
Gettin they chance on
Gettin they hands on F-A-B-O
