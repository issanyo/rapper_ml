[Intro: Fabolous]
I won't lose (Fabolous)
Somebody tell 'em I won't lose
Low so I won't lose (The Young OG)
Somebody tell 'em I won't lose

[Verse 1: Jessica]
Invisible, push through the fog
I had to find my way (yeah)
A glow of light, a spark of hope
If you imagine it you'll find

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica]
You reaching for all things
To follow your dreams
But nothing will stand in your way
You're not far, you're close
So stand up for yourself
It's written in the sky

[Chorus: Jessica]
Just spread your wings
Reach for your dreams
There's no mountain that's hard to move
Take a chance and try
You would never know
You're a hero, you can fly
You can fly
You're a hero, you can fly
You can fly

[Verse 2: Jessica]
Unthinkable, best is to come
The light is shining so bright now
No looking back, keep pressing on (hold on)
Cause your wings are made to fly

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica]
You reaching for all things
To follow your dreams
But nothing will stand in your way
You're not far, you're close
So stand up for yourself
It's written in the sky

[Chorus: Jessica]
Just spread your wings
Reach for your dreams
There's no mountain that's hard to move
Take a chance and try
You would never know
You're a hero, you can fly
You can fly
You're a hero, you can fly
You can fly

[Bridge: Jessica]
I don't plan on breaking down
I don't plan on falling down
I won't lose, I won't lose
Oh no no no no no

[Verse 3: Fabolous & Jessica]
Yeah, let's go Jess
You should've never doubted yourself
Matter of fact you should be proud of yourself
'Cause you had to find a way, go about it yourself
Nobody gave you direction, had to route it yourself
And you never got lost, losing's not an option
No time for L's, no time to fail
Winning like Steph Curry and them we warriors
Haters wanna see me in a crown, Victoria
But I'm in a Benz AC on 70, won't lose my cool
Gotta move cleverly
Chess, not checkers
Playing it with strategy
Me and Jessica, that's a win automatically

[Chorus: Jessica]
Just spread your wings
Reach for your dreams
There's no mountain that's hard to move
Take a chance and try
You would never know
You're a hero, you can fly
You can fly
You're a hero, you can fly
You can fly
