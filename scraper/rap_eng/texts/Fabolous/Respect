Yea, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers
I ain't no killer right
But y'all niggas gon' make me one
For real.. leave me alone, shit
You fuckin with the wrong one brotha
I'm telling ya

I'm sittin in the crib dreamin 'bout killin ya
With machine guns shotties, desert Eag' dillingers
Putting a bullet as big as a battery through a niggas anatomy
And watchin him die slow
You need full clips to push up in the joint
When you in the kinda truck that I push up to the joint
Cuz theses motherfuckas will push him to the point
That you'll end up locked down doin push ups in the joint
But they'll box you in the corner
And you can throw ya fists up and act like you a boxer on his corner
Ride wit ya gun in your glove box instead of on ya
You'll be six feet deep in one of them boxes if you wanna
Not me, I squeeze the clips drop from the handle
Till your remains is in a urn on top of the mantle
Till everybody scramble off the block like they Randall (run)
Till there's a mural on your block and some candles
Who wanna die?

I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
Cuz I'mma have to kill someone just to get some respeck

My teflons will have you screamin like Wyclef Jean
(someone please call 9-1-1)
But if they ever get the watch on my left arm
Ima have Marbury (more buried) than that guy Stephon
First, they put that white sheet over you brother
Then the newspapers put you all over the cover
Then you in a suit one hand cross over the other
Last you in the earth with the dirt over you brother
A tinted hearse is what most men leave in
Followed by a limo full of family and close friends greavin
One pull of marijuana
Ima wanna kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor
But, I'm loosin my patience
Fuck it, send me to the island I could use a vacation
Now it's easy for me to understand
How you could just kill a man

[Hook]
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
Cuz I'mma have to kill someone just to get some respeck

I'd rather be
Judged by twelve than carried by the six
My gun ain't on my man or carried by my chicks
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six
If I'm right here nigga then its right here nigga
Picture me put in my hearse
Like I ain't gotta clip full of hollow tips to put in these jerks
I might as well put in the work
Spit 'em up outta here then get 'em up outta here
I got the juice, like bishop had wit him
That just don't give a fuck, semi
Like ol' dog had wit him
I'm sayin prayers for my enemy
I hope god bless him, before the fucker run into me
I dunno what the fuck has got into me
But I know I don't want them slugs goin into me
I'm just tryin to live my life
So niggas better give me my respect or give me life

[Hook]
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin punk
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin chump
I don't wanna kill no one but I ain't no motherfuckin clown
Cuz I'mma have to kill someone just to get some respeck

Look what you made me do man
Look what you made me do man
I didn't want it to come to this, right
But fuck it..
Niggas will push you to that point man
Niggas will play with you so fuckin much man
Aggravate you so fuckin much man
That you wanna kill a nigga man
Yea
