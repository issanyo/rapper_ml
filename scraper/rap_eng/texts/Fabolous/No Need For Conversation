Ugh...
It feels good
If it feels good don't even fire again, you know
Get up man, real talk in New York for u man
Ooh

(fabolous)
Its all eyes on me like mister straw
So they wanna f**k you right in the door
Chicks coma around and put chest in the chore
So i ain't a playa that need a assist to score
Any messes with shore
The criss on that craw
Climb on a couch kick off the Christian Diors
I don't pop till a spend my pist on that boy
But i do it again if you miss me before
Its no big deal
I have so a big will
And them little cars with so big wheels
Put a little box for them all big steels
Pretty little chicks and none's big heels to me, i never give o's
Most girls are diggers who ain't going never hit gold
I get under the sun when the weather gets cold
8,4,5 when the 7 gets old

(Chorrus)

Stop that mamma
Can't u see that i'm a east-coast fellah?
Aye, aye

But i'm a black cars whiper
Thats just tighter
And u ain't give a damn like me
They say i'm the sickest since car the droped
The girls jumped to a quick demz car is hot
Its the truck with the 20" star in stops

If he staying to going
The stairs at the ear will be saying he's glowing
And they like my style in the way i been trowing
But thats when im boddered and they say that im blowing
Now you could make the choise if u're staying or going Girl
We could go any place in the world
In the jet whole 12 so we space ass hell ,girl
Nobody in the streetz is gonna hear

Most lanes track allongs

But can't keep with up like a bag of done's
Keep frontin like you spend
But your bag is lighter and lighter then micheals skin
But the other hand
Im the kind of brother man
With 50.000 of ice just the butter hand
Bentley, braclend, rock yourself a fan
In the zone that the teller time in them other land
Girls spred them legs ain't day im pragnum
Its the most to got, neon magnum
In the 22" with some brother who's schine
Thats why everbody want a mother like mine
A bralley be, with a walleys be
That ain't bigger dude's thats smove since balleys be

The eagles i f**ked by the lakers crew
Haha
