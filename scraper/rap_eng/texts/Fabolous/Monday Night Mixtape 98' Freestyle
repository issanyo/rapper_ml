[Intro]
Yeah it don't stop baby, it dont stop
Yo yo yo yo yo
Uh
1, 2 it don't stop
1, 2 it don't stop
Like this, like this
We gon' hit y'all like this
It don't stop
Yo

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Just in case y'all was lost, I'm the face in the Source
Long Cuban, white ice placed in the cross
Slow bros hate to see me race in the Porsche
Wanna call po's, have me gettin' chased by the force
Didn't know I got dough, my case gettin' tossed
And I steal y'all hoes, that's why y'all base when I floss
On a case to endorse, paces of franks
Turn star, now y'all wanna scar our faces wit' shanks
Can't stop to my dough done bought cases in banks
And me and my army, show in places in tanks
Blowin' pounds of the buda, throwin' rounds in the ruger
BK get hot, we gon' lounge in Bermuda
This nigga tryna seize more cheese than Sbarro
Pull up slowly, in the P's in the Camaro
Use to hustle, and go on knees for de niro
Now you hear me on the radio like Cease De Janeiro
Ain't nothin' changin', wit the track I lay now
'Cept I pack and spray now, a track you lay down
Say nothin' but got-

[Verse 2: Noreaga]
Now let me know who reppin'?
Who catch AND1's like Stephon?
Marbury
Who in the club without a weapon?
Shoot at ya feet, make you do the Puff dance to perfection (WHAT!)
End ya session, throw out a lesson
Been doin' this, since the days of Soul Sister
Go sister, sooooooul sister
Worlds biggest, diss ya whole click
Plus I know my.... bigger then ya man
Yo the way I make you cum quick
Quicker than me, slicker than me
Have the chick lickin' my knee
Yo I'mma nigga for life, nigga for ice
Hardly gamble
But here and there, still roll dice
If itâ€™s beef with me then you better think twice
Cause I go at ya head, at ya head it's a price
Y'all niggas is wrong even when y'all right
While I'm thugged out, finna be the next Suge Knight
Yo love women, they reason I still write
Uno dos tres quatro, pick one, and stick one
They all fall victim
That's why they wisdom
Only meant to know the knowledge a man give em
And if you know that, you're known to get lots of rhythm
You lose that, and be lost in the system
For any chalk, I pour them I'm like Atari
Nore ya man, only live to say sorry
Here to school youth like my little man Bari
The hood is a cage, trapped in the ill safari ya won't
Catch me alone without a gauge
What, won't, catch me alone out on stage
Cause my platoon, slick like Vidal Sassoon
Together we stand, while united we doom

WHAT! WHAT! WHAT!

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
Every week I'm in a different S, smokin' a spliff of cess
Bulky Coog' wit the vest, cop Smith and Wes'
Nigga riff or 'fess, he'll be at peace wit the rest
Tote a weapon, still be steppin' wit finesse
It's the F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S
In a new S, circling the US
Kissing at honeys I spot, smoke twenties of pot
Til my eyes is red, and it's hard to rise my head
Niggas who cause lies and spread, I supplies the bread
Go cap the empty clips, then fill you guys wit lead
I swarm the ghetto, calm and mellow
Sippin' Amaretto, til my eyes is almond yellow
That nick jay that Janay, sworn to hello
Stay armed for niggas who try to harm a fellow
Cause I winks to ya chick, rock links to my
Go in clubs, pop bubs, and drinks to I'm sick
Pop the most, roll dro in Optimo's
Push the drop to show, for niggas who pop for those
Who pop the Rose
Wit the stones in the face
Chromes in the waist, puttin' gnomes into place
These hot 9 shots'll put ya bones into place
BGS cream thieves and 80 of cream sleeves
Twist y'all honeys for 20's of green leaves
WHAT!!
