[Intro: Funk Flex]
Funk Flex, Fab
{You are now listening to Araabmuzik}
Champ whattup?

[Verse: Fabolous]
I ain't even gotta say much, ya know?
It's the money, haha...
Familiar with pain, but wanna know Joy
Money talks so you gotta raise your voice
Taking pictures in my latest gold Ro' boy
My Jewels on Cam? Oh boy
Undisputed Swag Champ, Flow Floyd
No L's, riding in that Rolls Royce
Or that Martin with shawty screaming "You Go Boy"
Smoking loud while killa rolling up more noise
You niggas playing with it but its no toy
I'm here to milk the game not go soy
Can't give these choosey bitches no choice
Can't give these loser niggas no voice
Only let the winners speak
Money talks, better make it count when you speak
And how that broke man gon' talk when
I'm riding like this and he Antione Walkin
Taking care of hoes, was they bad ain't the question
Sometimes a bad bitch is a even badder investment
Thirsty ass nigga, you should've had a refreshment
You moved her at to Cali, thought you had you a Fresh Prince (niceee)
Now go and grab me some breath mints
Haha, I be talking that shit
Have ya bitch hosting at the crib
Got a section and the bottles when she walk in that bitch
Keep walking then, bitch, you and ya cheap leggings
I'm the one with the change you can keep begging
With ya bum ass, shoulda changed her
Coulda had a little something in ya change cup

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Money talking over here we ain't tripping
Money talking over here we ain't tripping
Money talking over here we ain't tripping
I swear we ain't tripping, I promise we ain't tripping
Money talking over here we ain't tripping
Money talking over here we ain't tripping
I swear we ain't tripping I promise we ain't tripping
Money talking over here we ain't tripping

[Outro: Fabolous]
I got one, I got two
I got three - you and me
Money talking over here we ain't tripping
Money talking over here we ain't tripping
Throwing ones in the air like its singles
Chucking deuces up and all the shots are doubles
Hitting threes we just balling, we ain't tripping
I swear we ain't tripping, I promise we ain't tripping, yeah
