What you're looking for
Feelin' like you’ll never find
You spend the money but it never seems like you spend the time

Are you even sure
Could you make up your mind
Lookin' for all the answers
You should probably get in line

But not so fast
Just slow down (just slow down)
Maybe you should look around

Just get lost
Turn up the sound (turn up the sound)

‘Cause we get so high that we just fall, fall
Don’t need sleep tonight to dream this all, all

So come on (so come on)
‘Cause you know (‘cause you know)
What you want (what you want)
Here we go (here we go)

‘Cause we get so high that we just fall, fall

Come and find me now
‘Cause I’m where you wanna be
Don’t need no clocks to know that it’s time for you to come and rock with me

Open up your eyes
No tellin' what you’ll see
Now it’s time for you to stop
Just breathe

Told you not so fast
Just slow down
It's time for you to look around

Just get lost
Turn up the sound (turn up the sound)

‘Cause we get so high that we just fall, fall
Don’t need sleep tonight to dream this all, all

So come on (so come on)
‘Cause you know (‘cause you know)
What you want (what you want)
Here we go (here we go)

‘Cause we get so high that we just fall, fall

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
On the way up we going to all fall
On the elevator don’t you calls fall
You got to bounce back, gotta to brush it off
If you stay down then it's y'all fault
Imma ball hard 'til my ball falls
And god say my years are done
I know the top is where I’m goin'
Even though the bottom is where I’m from
And I get so high, cheap seats
Pillows of OG, we fall in deep sleep
That double R like roadrunner, all you hear is that beep-beep
I fall through like wintertime and you fall in love

‘Cause we get so high that we just fall, fall
Don’t need sleep tonight to dream this all, all

So come on (so come on)
‘Cause you know (‘cause you know)
What you want (what you want)
Here we go (here we go)

‘Cause we get so high that we just fall, fall

But not so fast
Just slow down
