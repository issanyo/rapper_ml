[Verse 1: August Alsina]
They don't ever see you like I do
First thing when you wake up
Before you put on your make up
And they don't really know you like I do
Cause with me you ain't the same
You ain't gotta run no game
Girl cause what you do and what I do ain't different
We both on a mission
I love your ambition
And I know how it's to hit the block and get the gwop
And you know what it is to hit the stage and make it pop
Like damn I hope somebody spend some money today
And I pray nobody come and try to take it away
Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money to make
So girl you know that

[Hook]
I ain't judging you
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Baby I salute
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money
Make that money girl it's yours
Spend that money girl it's yours
You work hard for all of it, it's yours
Work that body baby it's yours
I ain't judging you
Go and get your money, got and get your money, go and get your money

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
Single mother in college, working hard for them dollars
Girl we got something in common
Making money with vowels
See you pussy popping that onyx
Keep it clapping that magic
Got them niggas tricking that chalice
Come on making this happen
Girl I love seeing your back bend
They cashing out and you cash in
They going broke and you working
Back broke when you twerking
I know how hard this shit can be when income is uncertain
Hustlin just to make a way
I know you're thinking
Damn I hope somebody spend some money today
And I pray nobody come and try to take it away
Cause I'm just out here doing what I gotta do
Cause all these fucking bills are due
And I see all this money to make
So girl you know that

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
We grind together, we shine together
Show the single folks how to double
Two wrongs don't make it right
But two strongs make a power couple
And our trouble is small talkers
Talking down on the big spenders
But the winners focus on the win
And sore losers focus on the winners
Stacked up shawty, stacked up shawty
And if I ever need her, she the back up for me
Blacked up foree, his and hers 'Cedes
No hoes to the house, just the first lady
So gone get ya money, don't let nobody stop that
Even if ya gotta pop that (that body baby it's yours)
We do it big, and know together we 'bout to do it bigger
My little mama hustle harder than a lot of you niggas

[Hook]
