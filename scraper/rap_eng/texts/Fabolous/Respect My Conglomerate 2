[Intro]
This motion picture is being presented to you by the conglomerate entertainment
Please be advised that you should consider this as a warning

[Verse 1: Busta Rhymes]
Now we came here to demonstrate
All the real live shit that we create
We the master of the street fuck what you heard
Cause everything else is quite absurd
And you know we keep it tight, that's what they say
And when you whip it in your truck just bang this everyday
We won't stop rockin', we comin' correct
And all these rappers can't stand us but give us respect

[Hook]
Stop what you're doing ‘cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
You see we droppin' that strong shit, more powerful and dominant
So just respect my conglomerate

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Look, bitch I'm back, it's bigfoot
Giant King Kong boss presence, they've been shook, try it now
Lock the street, let the kid cook, tie it down
Don't be mad when your bitch look, quiet down
You don't sound too convincing
Low stamina rap niggas, you need ginseng
I godfather this shit, pinky ring king
I bomb shit, nuclear missiles is whistling
(Now ya'll niggas wanna run and hide like roaches)
Cargo of coke on them boats, let the ships in
It's been a drought, coke prices is up, ching-ching
Shell a nigga from Brooklyn house to Sing Sing
Cold winters get real warm, hailstorm
Like the shakin' and beefin' in jail dorms
Got a nigga beastin' aware, I'm in rare form
Now watch how they respectin' when ringin' the air horn

[Hook]
Stop what you're doing ‘cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
You see we droppin' that strong shit, more powerful and dominant
So just respect my conglomerate

[Verse 3: Fabolous]
With success comes stress if it's my grind
So I light up every night nigga, skyline
I keep gettin' better, they should call me fine wine
While these used-to-bes wish they filled with my time
But nah, it is what it fuckin' is
And goin' hard is just a part of the fuckin' biz
No porno, right now I'm in the Bordeaux
We usually in a pair of "damn I never saw those"
Glass of pink for everybody
They say stay hungry and never thirsty
So I'm buyin' drinks for everybody
Problem is that I can't link with everbody
And nowadays everybody think they everybody
You think you Big Meech? No you don't
Bring the strip club to the house? No you won't
And I'd invite you to the top but I'm sure
It's for real niggas and you'd get stopped at the door

[Hook]
Stop what you're doing ‘cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
You see we droppin' that strong shit, more powerful and dominant
So just respect my conglomerate

[Verse 4: Jadakiss + Styles P]
Yeah, a real nigga never worry bout what a coward do
Time is money
So I respect what an hour do
One phone call
And the posse'll shower you
You know my regime is much more powerful
Same plans of course
Every gram is nos
Get charged to the game cause every man's a boss
Respect my conglomerate, nigga
Cash in the stash and the mask
My connect is anonymous
You don't wanna problem with
Niggas that get your momma hit
No death where the flesh rule
Nigga I'm the shit no restroom
No room to rest
Them niggas'll test you
See where it gets you
Baptize these rap guys, the gat flies
Cocaine crack pies, big niggas get half size
When the sword hits the waist or the four hits the face
He gone need a prayer, put the call into Ma$e
I put it all in the coke
Put it all in the Chase
All in Wachovia
All in the H
9mms and Tec-9's, you will respect mines

[Hook]
Stop what you're doing ‘cause I'm about to ruin
The image and the style that you're used to
You see we droppin' that strong shit, more powerful and dominant
So just respect my conglomerate
