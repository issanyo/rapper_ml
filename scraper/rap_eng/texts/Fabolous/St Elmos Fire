When I start to care, then I find there is no one there
But I think of you and I know we are something new
We get high and higher, crazy blue like St. Elmo's fire
Love so sharp and flat, that it's hard to know just where you at, where you at

We get higher and higher, crazy blue, like St. Elmo's fire
Love so sharp and flat, that it's hard to know just where you're at
We get higher and higher, crazy blue, like St. Elmo's fire
Love so sharp and flat, that it's hard to know just where you're at

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Stimulate your mind, girl, it's Friday you ain't got shit to do
I put you on some real shit if you ain't scared to to take a hit or two
Stay away from that reggie, can't deal with the middle men
Who gives a fuck if he keep em clean, you can't ride on them lil' 10's
They say they got it, they ain't got it, they don't seem to feel no guilt
Got peanut butter, but no jelly, got cereal, but no milk
Where I'm from that's a half ass nigga, half of the time ole "half past" nigga
Mad cause they can't get down with the team
Still sittin at the end of the draft ass nigga
Getting high on these low lifes, dead the chumps, give em no life
Cut em loose, keep your knife
Don't meet a ho and make her your wife
Don't make a ho your husband either
Hard to win the game when you're playing with a cheater
I be telling them that you can't change niggas
Better off keeping that change for the meter

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
How high? How high? Just came from the OG, man
My eyes so red, man, that M-E-T-H-O-D, man
Im talking about pimping been since
Pimping been since been pimping. UH
I'm talking about "Don't dare nutta motherfuckers saying that near nutta." UH
Tell em no more Mr. Nice Guy, you hoes way past Half Baked
If I got paid to hear chicks lie, would make more cheese than Kraft make
And these niggas be acting up, Rhi-Rhi must be serious
Wonder what that shit hittin' foe, real niggas is curious!
These niggas stuck on my whole joint
Already know how the high feel
Let the chick know she is not low, even though she in high heels
Six hundred for the gas, that ain't nothing but a high bill
Bitch, don't be a high kill, you know over here
