Invisible in the fog
I have to find myself, yeah
The hope in that small light
Just by thinking about it, you’ll find

When I hold my hand out
To that high place
It feels like I can touch

Days I looked forward to
Are they closer now?
I can draw it in the sky

Just spread your wings
To the end
Follow the sound of your heartbeat
Close your eyes
Spread out your dreams

You’re a hero you can fly
You can fly
You’re a hero you can fly
You can fly

A world that you’ve never seen before
Will appear before you
Fly above the clouds
Cause your wings are meant to fly

When I hold my hand out
To that high place
It feels like I can touch

Days I looked forward to
Are they closer now?
I can draw it in the sky

Just spread your wings
To the end
Follow the sound of your heartbeat
Close your eyes
Spread out your dreams

You’re a hero you can fly
You can fly
You’re a hero you can fly
You can fly

I won’t cry now
I won’t give up

I won't lose
I won't lose
Oh no no no no no

Yeah let’s go Jess
You should’ve never
Doubted yourself
Matter of fact you should be
Proud of yourself
‘Cause you had to find
A way to go about it yourself
Nobody gave you direction
Had to route it yourself
And you never got lost
Losing's not an option
No time for L's no time to fail
Winning like Steph Curry
And them we warriors
Haters wanna see me
In a Crown Victoria
But I'm in a Benz
AC on 70
Won't lose my cool
Gotta move cleverly
Chess not checkers
Playing it with strategy
Me and Jessica
That's a win automatically

Just spread your wings

To the end
Follow the sound of your heartbeat
Close your eyes
Spread out your dreams

You're a hero you can fly
You can fly
You're a hero you can fly
You can fly
