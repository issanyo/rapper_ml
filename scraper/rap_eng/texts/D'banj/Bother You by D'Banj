Eh ah, I’m Dbanj
I say, I’m Dbanj
Baby I dont mean to bother you
But can I borrow some of your time, some of your time
Oya tell me who discovered you, tell me who discovered you
Cause you’re the treasure I don dey find
And if I find you e go be
When I find you omo e go be
Fiesta, forever, whenever, however, the weather, together
Can I borrow some of your time
I’m not leaving without you, baby not tonight
Tell me what I gotta do to make you feel alright
Let me take you round the world, meet you anywhere
Dont tell me that you’re far away
Want you by my side, take you on a ride

Omo omo call me up and I’ll be
Time to make a wish oh

But can I borrow some of your time, some of your time
Oya tell me who discovered you, tell me who discovered you
Cause you’re the treasure I don dey find
And if I find you e go be
When I find you omo e go be

Can I borrow some of your time
Wanna love you like a wantintin
Give me your heart girl wantintin
Oh wanna give you all the finest things
Because you’re the cutest girl I’ve seen
Hey you too sweet like cake icing
Oh ah what have I seen, hey lets change this movie scene
We gonna wild out like charlie shin
Anywhere you go I go go, even if you run I go run
How you dey do me I don’t know, dont know
Baby I dont mean to bother you
But can I borrow some of your time, some of your time
Oya tell me who discovered you, tell me who discovered you
Cause you’re the treasure I don dey find
