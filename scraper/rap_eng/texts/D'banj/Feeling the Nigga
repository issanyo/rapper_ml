[Akon:]
Baby I know you feelin' me
But you know you killin' me
And if I didn't know any better
I would thought you were my enemy
By the way that you teasin' me
Even though you wanna give it to me
But you keep holding back on the cookie
Sayin' that I got too many
But you know it's a lie
I'm that type of guy
That will make you feel so nice
That you can't deny
But you so attached to me
And you don't know why
And you goin' end up in the limo
Showin' me how to ride

[Akon:]
Say she mad at her boyfriend
Looked at him like a toy friend
Always on the corner doing nothin'
Teasin' the girls that loiterin'
Never asked for nothin'
She just wanted a little bit of lovin'
She prayin' to God everyday
That He will come give her somethin'
I got plenty
What you wanted is right here
Baby I know that you are out there searching for tender loving care
Baby I know that your heart is out searchin' for something right here
And you want me to pull your hair
And tell you how much I care

[D'Banj:]
So I met her in gwagwalada
Never seen a baby like that
Approach her, give her my word
Suddenly we start a loving like that
Everythin' so cool
She lovin' everythin' I do
Then all I wanted to do
Is to show you a repeat of my world
So I take her to Lagos
I open my mansion
I show her the coco
She show me the loda
We started the nackiin'
I took her shoppin'
I took her to polo
We started the spendin'
We started the ballin'
She got addicted
