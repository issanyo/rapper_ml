[Chorus]
Don’t know nothing about me
I don’t know nothing about you
But you feel you gat the need to be talking shii about me
But you can’t deny that you gat no clue
If you know what have known
If you see what have seen
Everywhere you see me, salute…
You see driving through you, salute…
You know my money source is from the root
Son of the soil be balling from the root
So salute… Salute

[Hook]
Wa beri fun mi now
You see me driving through you, salute
Wa beri fun mi now
You know my money source is from the root
Wa beri fun mi now
Son of the soil be balling from the root
So salute… Salute

[Verse 1: D’banj]
Beri fun mi, i’m ahead of the game
Turnup up for me
Make you see as my money dey rain
Beri fun mi, cos you know we’re not the same
You know i ball out till sun down till sun up
Top of the morning in Dublin
Bourne appétit in paris
Drinking my tea in London

Got a deal now in Beverly hills
Gotta be there tomorrow
Have been around the world now
Still eating amala in lagos

[Chorus]
Don’t know nothing about me
I don’t know nothing about you
But you feel you gat the need to be talking shii about me
But you can’t deny that you gat no clue
If you know what have known
If you see what have seen
Everywhere you see me, salute…
You see driving through you, salute…
