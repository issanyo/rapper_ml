[Chorus]
As I dey go (x10)
Plenty blessings just dey follow me everywhere as I dey go
Open doors in all my ways everyday as I dey go
If dem like make dem do anyhow I go still make my money
Some of them dey ask question na God write my story, my series
If at all dem jealous us we still sweet like honey, like sugar
Dollar like na one thousand we go still buy Ferrari pelu Bugatti
