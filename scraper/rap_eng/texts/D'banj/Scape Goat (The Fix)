[Intro: Kanye West & (D'Banj)]
GOOD Music, Yeezy
(I'm D'Banj)

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
If you ask me
Anybody who ain’t tell you you was beautiful today need their ass beat
As we proceed, Island breeze, light the weed
I couldn’t find the words on how I feel
But what I lacked in skill I made up for in real
Time, the most precious thing a man could give
Because what she givn' back is why that man can live
We need to take a break, minus the screech, oh
Find a resort, what? Private beach, Oooh
Pina colada sippin', by the sunset
My mission is to find every position, we ain't done yet

[Hook : D'banj]
Take my heart, take my love
Take my body, come build my home
Stay with me di Iyawo mi
Cause you love me

I will be your Scape goat honey
Cause you came through for me
You gave me break through baby (x2)

[Verse 2: D'banj]
Baby Boo I can see your eyes
Say you don jam many fools for your life
Them go come as lovers as them disguise
But as time goes by, na your body be the price
Your back side sef...wey you carry na die
That's why sometimes I no dey surprise
Them go say them love you but that na lie
Chop and clean mouth, tell you bye bye
Me sef i no tell you say na me holy pass
Some people dey talk say i dey use jazz
Them say I bush, Some say I razz
Them say I be nobody, I no get class, Well
I've been bad and I know it and I'm sorry - wanna show it
But no one would give me a chance to prove myself
Despite what you've heard of me
You still went ahead to be with me
You have chosen to be there for me
To you, I make this vow
I say...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kanye West]
You getting louder than a two year old drumset
That's a mean gift, you work a mean stick
You’re like a phoenix, you could be my phoenix
Just rub your hands all over my v-neck
Swag, swag on Mach 5
Pac, 'cause don't it feel like Pac alive?
Feel my apocalypse, feel like I could just
Touch heaven with a Goddess in my fingertips
And I’m just trying to kiss every single lips
Hey Yeezy, what’s your next single is?
That D'banj causing hysteria
Soon as we hop of the plane in Nigeria

[Hook]

[Outro]
Omo toh good oh (toh good oh)
Oh nice oh (toh good oh)
Omo toh clean oh (toh clean oh)
Omo to set oh (toh set oh)
Toh sweet oh (toh sweet oh)
