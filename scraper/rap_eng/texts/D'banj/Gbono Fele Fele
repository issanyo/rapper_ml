[Verse1:D'Banj]

Don't know about you but I'm handsome
Most people wanna hold me for ransome
See the kokolets all up in my mansion
Hmmn.. African Michael Jackson
Just to see me now dem dey pay a large sum
And on stage I dey give them all the action
In the room, maximum satisfaction
So don't hate me now cos...

[Hook]

MO GBONO FELI FELI BI AMALA TO JINA GAN GAN

(* 2)

[Verse2]

Everybody listen when I speak (Are you with me?)
I get ten million in a week (Are you with me?)
I pull up in the club in a drop (Are you with me?)
And when the people see me dem dey stop (Are you with me?)
Before I bin dey hustle just to chop (Are you with me?)
And that time nobody dey talk (Are you with me?)
But Baba GOD put me on top
Bebelube make them shut up

[Hook]

[Verse3]

In life people will hate you
Do anything to break you
Don't let nothing faze you
Even if they forsake you
You can stand up tall
Na your enemy go fall
Don't fear them and believe in yourself
Make dem know say na you fine pass
Make you look them in the eyes and say

[Hook]

I'm hot and you're not
Im hot and you're not
He's hot and you're not
I'm hot and you're not
