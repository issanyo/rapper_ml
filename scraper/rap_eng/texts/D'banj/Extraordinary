I thought that she was ordinary
Only saw her body (Only saw her body)
So I thought that she was ordinary
But she revealed herself in the night of the day
What I found out omo i dunno (i dunno)
When I caresses her in the night of the day
When I saw what i saw i was blown

You're that girl that captured my heart
As she revealed herself in the night of the day
What I found out omo I dunno (I dunno)
When I caresses her in the night of the day
When I saw what I saw I was blown
