Verse 1

Oya suddenly
Step in the club, they're loving me
Standing so far, yet they're touching me
I can feel their fingers robbing me
She's calling me
Late in the night she's fucking me
All day long she's stalking me
And all these happen suddenly, so suddenly
She go say ori yato sori
If you ask her why, she go say
Ori yato sori
If you ask her wetin she go say
Owo yato sowo
Gbogbo wa mo wipe
Koko yato si koko

Verse 3

I wan talk about this young girl
One of the finest girls I've seen
When she step over the dance floor
Her dance step so enticing
She would say kokomaster
You too strong like
When we act to the movies
Especially the late night scenes

Well I remember the time
When just to get a girl to be mine
Dem go tell me say I no fine
And I poor, I poor I no commit crime
Dem go dey yap me no be small
Dem no even send me at all at all
Jus to bring their number make I call
Dem go still dey hala at at all at all

Now dem know the kind of living
I'm living, I'm living
I say Now dem know the kind of living
I'm living, I'm living
