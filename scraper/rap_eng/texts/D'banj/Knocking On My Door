Oh ah oh ah don need anybody to tell am fly
You know that am bad but I do right

Oh flexing flexing desperado
Turn up turn up spending my dough
Paparazi all in ma tho

You say why, why am so fly
The the question now will be bugging your mind
He’s one of a kind

See you wondering why you see him all the time
