From sun up to sun down
Decisions make my head spin round
Make me drunk, sick and tired
Keep me up 'til I retire
And while I could be out bar hopping
Meat market, rocker chick shopping
Out there, chasing my dick
In its never ending search for chicks
But I'd rather be sleeping
In my bed, crashed out
A slice of death, wrapped up
All in wool, passed out
Drunk, you stupid fool
No more waking hassles
Weary of the daily battles
So on my bed, I lay curled
A 'Could be' man of the world
But I'd rather be sleeping
In my bed, crashed out
A slice of death, wrapped up
All in wool, passed out
Drunk, you stupid fool
