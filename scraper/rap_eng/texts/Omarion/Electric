Go head from the top!
Yeah. Ye!
Turn my music up (Haaaaa)
Is y'all wit me?
You know, I can feel your presence
Come closer
Yeah

You turn me on
You flip the switch
I feel the current
Pushin me, pullin me
Cloooose to you
Shocks in my system
There's an attraction
Look how I'm actin
Hard for me to keep my coooool

Vibratiooooons
Feel it in my chest! (feel that? haha)
When we toooooouch
There's a charge I get!
(uh, you feel that? I feel that)
There is an energy
That I just can't control (It's electric)
When it takes over me
I let myself go!
(It's electric, oh, so, so electric)

Let's start some static
A bit of friction
Feel so magnetic
Pullin me more into youuuu! Ho!
I got you open
The waves are flowin
So now you're glowin
I knew you were feelin me toooo!

Vibratiooooons
Feel it in my chest! (ah, you feel that?)
When we toooooouch
There's a charge I geeeeet! Woo!!
There is an energy (energy)
That I just can't control (Oooooooh, oh)
When it takes over me (Over me, oooh)
I let myself go!
(It's electric, oh, so, so electric)

It lives inside of me (alright)
A seperate (ye!) entity
I can hear it's heart beat
It's electric, It's electric, It's electric!!
WOOO!!

There is an energy (energy!!)
That I just can't control (I just can't controool, no no!!)
When it takes over me (Over meee! Yeaaah!!)
I let myself go!

Oh!
Woo!
Oh no!
Aha!
Oh!
Give it to me!
You gotta watch me!
'cause you know I'm dancin right!
It's electric
He!
Yeah
Stop that beat - keep it going
Yeah, keep that
