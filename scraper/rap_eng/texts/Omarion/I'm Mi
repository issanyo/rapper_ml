[Intro:]
Yeah
This is raw, nigga
Mila J, Omarion
This is smooth (let it go)

[Verse 1: Mila J]
I come from the land down under
Blaze up
It's Mila, the girl wonder
Back with it

Get it cracked
Just like thunder
'Cuz the flow will vibrate the tundra

And my glow will radiate the summer
Bang this in yo' Coups, Lex and Hummers
Move to the rhythm
Like I'm an old drummer

Niggas swarm the dance floor
Like piranhas
'Cause I'm keeping it hot like Tijuana
But I'm hood as Shaniqua and Kiana
Sexy as Aaliyah or Madonna

Donna Karan
Bitches starin'
But I ain't carin'
They know she will kill a song
Ever seen a girl in a chinchilla thong?

Have your eyes
Deep fried like won ton?
Can hate if you wanna
Just throw up the one, oh

[Chorus:]

[Mila J:]
Back in the club
Once again
It's me
This ain't your average chick
It's me

[Omarion:]
Go head
Work your body
And let me show you
How to party, girl

[Mila J]
Back in the house
Once again
It's me
(Smirnoff)
Over long island ice tea

[Omarion]
Go head
Work your body
And let me show you
How to party

[Bridge:]
Let it go [repeat x8]
That's whussup, y'all
The party has just begun
All the fellas throw your cash out
But you can keep the ones

[Verse 2: Mila J]
Bad little mama
Slick with the grammar
Bionic like dun, na, nun, na, nun, na, nun, ah

Dookie rope chain
In the pink leather bomber
Niggas can't see me
Haters tryna find me like Osama

Rock like nirvana (Mila, Mila)
Chicks love throwin'
They hips to my heater

Anywhere I sit
I'm gon kick my feet up
Re-up
Flow
Get slow
Watch me speed up

You know I can make 'em
Into every single synonym
Sweet as cinnamon
Got 'em as soon as I put my venom in
Got his toes curlin' and rippin' out of his Timberlands

I ain't even give him my booty
Look what I did to him (damn)
Now, he trippin'
Give him some Ritalin

Mila J
Black, Asian and Indian
That's why the flow
Mix up so smoothly
Ask Jamba Juice
Who really invented smoothies
Ooh, wee

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge #2:]
Let it go [Repeat x8]

Attention, all cars
Coups, SUV's and drops
Turn your systems up!
It's time to pack the parking lot

[Verse 3:]
So gutta
But butter like Parkay
M-J getz biz like Markie

Zoom-a-zoom-zoom-a-zoom-a-zang
I know you love the swagga
When I'm doin my thang

I know you love the way
I pull up in the Range with the audacity
To rock like two chains

Rings on all five fingers
Assault with a deli pepper
Like I'm a legend from Queens
Knaw mean?

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge #3:]
Let it go [Repeat x8]

Party people
Your dreams has now been fufilled
All the ladies
Report to the dance floor
And spill your drinks
Ha ha!

[Repeat Chorus:]

Let it go
