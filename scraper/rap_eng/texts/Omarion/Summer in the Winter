[Intro: Omarion]
Tell me what your body wanna know
Fly you anywhere you wanna go
Baby I just really wanna know
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Hook: Kid Ink & Omarion]
I know I've been gone for a minute
Just made it back to the city
Lil' mama got the shorts on, in December
It feel like the summer in the winter, aw yeah (Woah)
It feel like the summer in the winter, aw yeah (Uh-Huh)
It feel like the summer in the winter, aw yeah (Uh-Huh)

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
We out in L.A
These bitches all tryna show their belly
It's a poolside party at the telly
This my city, ain't nothin' you could tell me
But I still ride
Pistol grip pump on my lap at all times
I knew she was from the dark side
Cause soon as she walked in the door she wanted wi-fi
Woah, it's about a hundred in the Valley
It's about a 4 hour drive to Vegas
11 A.M. they in bikinis half naked
Just dropped out of college, all year, spring-breakin'
Take off my shirt, say I'm tatted like Jose
Tell you've been tannin', your skin look like Ros√©
Your body, I'll throw a stack for
Off the backboard, she came back for it

[Hook: Kid Ink & Omarion]
I know I've been gone for a minute
Just made it back to the city
Lil' mama got the shorts on, in December
It feel like the summer in the winter, aw yeah (Woah)
It feel like the summer in the winter, aw yeah (Uh-Huh)
It feel like the summer in the winter, aw yeah (Uh-Huh)

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
It feel like summer in the winter
It feel like I hit the game winner
I went from a bucket to a Bentley
And now I'm hittin' donuts in that bitch 'til I'm dizzy
But I still ride (Skrt!)
Hit the corner like I did a drive-by
I know, it was like 2
And you still walkin' around in your bathin' suit
Hot damn, I'm sayin'
The more that you dance is a chance that I might not control my hands
From them hands
I went downtown and hit Club Sands
But ain't nothin' like Tootsies out in MIA
Where them Latin girls like ven aqui
I alley oop off the backboard
Throw a stack for it, she came back for it

[Bridge: Omarion]
It comes at no surprise
We do this all the time
Every day is like the weekend
It feel like the summer in the winter, aw yeah (Uh-Huh)
Everyday is like the weekend
It feel like the summer in the winter, aw yeah (Uh-Huh)

[Hook: Kid Ink]
I know I've been gone for a minute
Just made it back to the city
Lil' mama got the shorts on, in December
It feel like the summer in the winter, y'all
It feel like the summer in the winter
It feel like the summer in the winter, y'all
It feel like the summer in the winter
It feel like...

[Intro: Omarion & Kid Ink]
Tell me what your body wanna know
Fly you anywhere you wanna go
Baby I just really wanna know
Can we just link up?
Can we just link up?
I just really, really wanna
It feel like the summer in the winter, y'all
It feel like the summer in the winter, aw yeah
