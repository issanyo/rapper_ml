[Verse 1]
Temperatures are warms
How'd you get me home?
Girl I need your love
Pull me into your storm
Cause I want your rain
To fall on my face
Just like that morning dew
Listen to the voice inside you

[Chorus]
I feel her pulling, pulling
She keep on pulling
I empty the clip
I took a bullet
Feeling so foolish
You want me to shoot it?
She want me to shoot it

[Verse 2]
(Hol' up) [?]
But imma let you do you
You know what I'm about to
Go diving in your monsoon
Cause I'll drink your [?]
Just say okay
Just say okay
I'm feeling [?]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Pull me into your storm
Don't you let me go
You know that I know
They say you never know
Til you let it go
Cause I want your rain
To fall on my face
