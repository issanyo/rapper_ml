Girl nobody else can make me feel the way you do
Because the way you do
Because your love is true
Oh girl your loves the truth

VERSE 1
I like the way you touch me
I like the way you feel
I'm glad that we're together
This here feels so real
Nobody ever told me
That it could feel like this
That i could find heaven, heaven with a kiss

Woah girl, you are the one that is sold out
Your what my momma was talkin bout
Oh baby girl you got me

CHORUS

VERSE 2
Oh damn I'm so addicted
Addicted to you girl
Sometimes it even scares me
That you've become my world
People think I'm crazy
They say I'm in too deep
There's more than meets the eye
That they could ever see

Woah girl, you are the one that is sold out
Your what my momma was talkin bout
Oh baby girl you got me

CHORUS

Oh girl, aye, wwwooooaahhhh

Everytime I need some love
I run to you
I run straight to you
Because your love is true

Everytime I turn around
Ooohh, you're right there(x2)
You pretty girl
So fine, yea, uh
