[Chorus: Problem]
When you on the pole
Everything be stopping
Girl you in control everybody watching
I admire what you do
I see you when you walk, gon' mommy pop it
Green make you go, I don't want you to stop it
I admire what you do
I do

[Verse 1: Problem]
What?
What?
Baby you are so sexy, a maniac, yeah a brainiac
Shit maybe you should come test me
Balling big, yeah balling big, shit I should win the espy
Jay-Z thanks for that line
I heard about you from the home boys but I didn't think you was that fine
Like damn, where you been?!
Body like a house girl let me in
Your man is a loser bet I win, bet I win, bet I win
Your looking like a lick I could run up in
Bet if I hit you your mind be gone,til November
Then cold as December,last love stop me if I'm wrong
Shh,quiet huh?
Make you laugh I'm a riot huh?you can tell by my look
I'm a bad bitch crook
Walk in the spot every bad bitch look
Walk in the spot every bad bitch took
Had so many bad bitches with ass in my past
No gas,i should write a bad bitch book
Holding the book with that average look

[Chorus: Problem]
When you on the pole
Everything be stopping
Girl you in control everybody watching
I admire what you do
I see you when you walk, gon' mommy pop it
Green make you go, I don't want you to stop it
I admire what you do
I do

[Verse 2: Omarion]
I come in, a cool night, she pulling on my chest
My tattoo she kissing, my tattoo she kissing
Her panties, got missing, Hennessy I’m sipping
She so wet, I’m swimming, she so wet, I’m drowning
And it all happened at your job
K.O.D., Sin City, Perfections, Stadium, Onyx
I'm just being honest
I tip her she owes me
The tip in,no clothing
Looking at my Rolex,while your hands in motion
To myself I'm toasting
Lame niggas get no sex
Turn around and back it up
Drop it low then arch it up
Fuck a hater they don't know
Just keep dancing on that pole

[Chorus: Problem]
When you on the pole
Everything be stopping
Girl you in control everybody watching
I admire what you do
I see you when you walk, gon' mommy pop it
Green make you go, I don't want you to stop it
I admire what you do
I do

[Bridge: Problem]
If you want to cut ,baby I can chop it
Put you on the ropes,beat it till I knock it
If you holding bags, you should gone and drop it
I got all this cash,you should gone and drop it off

[Verse 3: Tank]
I'm willing to manage you and take this whole thing over
Find out what your real name is and get a little closer
These other niggas in here playing with your feelings
I would take you outta here and make you have my children
Yeah,i'm gone,a nigga really out here getting turnt up
But quicker now but in the work up
I go work up in this thang
I got bands playing all night,bands set to take flight
Bands that a niggas wanna give you
Then a band is for life
