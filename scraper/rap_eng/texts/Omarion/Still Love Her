[Intro:]
Welcome to the Care Package 2
Sit back and enjoy...

[Verse 1:]
Is it all in my head
More patron I done ran out
Used to be right here
She ain't up in my bed now
Now she up in this club
Walking 'round with her legs out
Showin' everybody love
Fucked around and got left out

[Bridge:]
Pour some for a minute
'Fore I knew it we finished
So they gave me time
Let me figure out
Then before I could we'd finished
Niggas all up on her
I'm actin' like I don't want her
Real nigga shit I'm dealing with
Can't accept that it's over

[Hook:]
I still love her like she came with it
I still love her like she came with it
My money up
My bottles up
My whole section turnt up
Still it ain't enough
I still love her like she came with it
I still love her like she came with it
My money up
My bottles up
My whole section turnt up
Still it ain't enough

[Verse 2:]
It was us, nigga
Pull up in the truck with her
She was fly, so was I
We was both killers
Bonny, Clyde, down to die
We was so trilla

[Bridge:]

[Hook:]
