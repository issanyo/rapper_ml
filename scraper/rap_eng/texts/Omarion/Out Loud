Hook:

Baby girl I wanna lay you down
So take your clothes off right now
I'mma make you scream my name out loud
I'mma make you scream my name out loud
Baby light the candles
Lay you on the table
So we can make love love love
So we can make love
I'mma make you scream my name out loud

Verse:

There it is, you standing there
Looking so sexy right now
Yeah I drank too much
I promise let me take your clothes off
Let me satisfy your mind
Girl you showed up right on time
I can hear you body speaking to me
And its saying things that I like
So I'mma lay you down tonight

(Hook)

Verse:

Say baby when you’re giving it to me
Look at me when you throwing it back
I’m going deeper
Got your legs shaking
Making it a little steeper
Your skin touching my skin
Arch it up arch it up
You were chosen for tonight
I'mma kiss your body how you like
When I lay you down

(Hook)
