[Hook: Omarion]
Cocky vs Panani what does it mean to you baby
If we are getting each other’s then you can be my lady
It will be me and you for eternity we’ll get married maybe
So I’ll be waiting upstairs in our bedroom for you bubby

[Bridge: AmarieMowatt]
See I’ve been waiting in the same position for too long
Lit all of our candles, can smell fragrance it was strong
Was in the shower for about an hour hoping you’d come
Went to bed woke up with no one on my left or right baby where did I go wrong

[Hook: Omarion]

[Verse 1: AmarieMowatt]
Baby girl you know that you’re a slut
A slut that I love, but
But time goes over
And I don’t know who to trust
Of course you can say to trust me
But no one knows where that pussys been
Especially not me, and neither a yg
Now baby girl you best answer all my questions
Come through the door stop lying
See I think you were sleeping
With another guy named Jason
Jason anonymous, fuck it tell me who he is
If you was sleeping with him
I’d clap like him a bitch
Telling him to not touch that shit
But hit his momma fat top lip
Then he goes crying and doesn’t know when to finish
Nigga likes limo but he can’t see me though

[Hook: Omarion]

[Verse 2: AmarieMowatt]
Just remember the door always opened to you son
I can disown you like that man, then you’re gone fam
Go back to the past, to your childhood, it tells a story daddy
Just tell-el-el, my baby I won't be lazy
All that pussy being up in my face, I licked you
And that dick being up your fanny, yeah I fucked up

[Hook: Omarion]
