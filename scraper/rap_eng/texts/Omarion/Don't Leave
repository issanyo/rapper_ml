[Verse 1]
Don't leave me now, now that I've turned around
Don't leave me now, cuz I finally figured it out

Don't leave me now, cuz you deserve to keep
The man you made out of me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna hurt
Don't want you to cry, I don't wanna do dirt no more
Don't get back the keys, don't walk out the door
Need you here with me, girl this love is worth fighting for

[Chorus]
Don't leave me
Don't leave me, no
Don't leave me
Don't leave me, no

[Verse 2]
Don't leave me now, now the game that a n***a play done
Finally drove you away
Don't leave me now, cuz I can do better
Girl I can do better

Don't leave me now, you say I don't do you the same
I done fell off, now you wanna walk away baby hell no

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna hurt
Don't want you to cry, I don't wanna do dirt no more
Don't get back the keys, don't walk out the door
Need you here with me, girl this love is worth fighting for

[Chorus]
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me
Don't leave me, no

Say you â€˜bout to leave but what you're going for?
You already know I ain't bout to let you roll like that
You'll be talking shit and I'll just go alone
Even if you go, I know that you gonna roll right back
She say that I don't listen, I do the big thangs with the little shit, I miss it
She really just wanna fuck with a n***a, that's official
I promise that I'm tryin' to give you my last initial
Don't leave now

Cuz I don't wanna go crazy
But you're driving me there
Now you're fucking with my ego
But baby I don't care

I don't wanna fight, I don't wanna hurt
Don't want you to cry, I don't wanna do dirt no more
Don't get back the keys, don't walk out the door
Need you here with me, girl this love is worth fighting for

Don't leave me
Don't leave me, no
Don't leave me
Don't leave me, no
