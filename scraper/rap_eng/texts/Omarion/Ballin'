[Intro]
Omarion
(is it the shoes)

[Verse 1]
Westbrook with the ball
Number one in the Rose
Ballin' out of control
Big whip with the hoes
Drive 40 on the road
[??]
AP on my wrist
Nigga you ain't got this
I park my whip in the hallway
Call it the Timothy Hardaway
I'm MVP on my all day
Just might sell out the Barclay
I just might jump on the foul line
I'm eatin' up on my down time
Every time you come around
Put on a show like it's half time
(Swish)

[Hook]
Ballin', ballin', ballin' (Swish)
Ballin', it's Magic, Jordan
I'm scorin', I'm scorin' (Swish)
Ballin'

[Verse 2]
I turn a lay up to a dunk
See I've been ballin' from the jump
Ok see KD, Rondo, no KG
Black card got no limit, call that Master P
I'm from the west like Delonte
I got my Yeezy's from Kanye
I'm pass for a week
[?] with the ball mayne
Y'all niggas got hoop dream
I'm MJ with the hoop [?]
Call me [?] all your friends come
Told her "baby that's a Air One's"

[Hook]
Ballin', ballin', ballin' (Swish)
Ballin', it's Magic, Jordan
I'm scorin', I'm scorin' (Swish)
Ballin'

[Outro]
Is it the shoes?
Is it the shoes?
Is it the shoes?
I turn a lay up to the dunk
I've been ballin' from the jump
