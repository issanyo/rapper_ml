[Verse 1:Bow Wow]
I'm young, I'm right, I'm flashy, I'm fly
So fly, I'm about to take off
Now O is the R&B, the Hip-Hop, that's me
Tonight we about to Face Off
Now watch as I drop that top on the Aston Mar', few shots then we left the bar
Anything she's asking for, I'll make it appear like a magic wand
I got the antidote, I got the stroke right and a pole
Gotta do it right on camera though
Bring another friend so my man can go
O
