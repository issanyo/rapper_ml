[Hook]
You've got the power long as you want it
Long as you got me inside
You've got the power long as you want it
Long as you got me inside

[Verse 1]
Girl are you crying? You're moaning like that body's dying
The only lonely, thoughts your body's ever known, ooh
Girl we've been doing things so long
My voice is almost gone
But if you need girl I can help you breath

[Pre-Hook]
And we can go on, on and on all night
That's tellin' me
It’s worth the sacrifice

[Hook]
You've got the power long as you want it
Long as you got me inside, got me inside

You gave your all, its no denying
You sped it up then your body made you slow it down

Girl we been goin up for so long
And every part of you is so soft
Girl when your eyes are closed
My love will help you see

[Pre-Hook]
And we can go on, on and on all night
That's tellin' me
It’s worth the sacrifice

[Hook]
You've got the power long as you want it
Long as you got me inside, got me inside

And we can go on, on and on all night
That's tellin' me
It’s worth the sacrifice

You've got the power long as you want it
Long as you got me inside, got me inside

You've got the power long as you want it
Long as you got me inside, got me inside
Long as you got me
Long as you got me
Long as you got me (inside)
Long as you got me got me inside
