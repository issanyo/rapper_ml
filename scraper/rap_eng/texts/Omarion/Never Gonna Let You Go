Second you caught my eye
Girl, I couldn't deny
That you got me on fire, baby
Something 'bout the way you walk
I just can't get enough
Girl, you got that good stuff
I think I'm losing my mind
Girl, can we just talk, baby?
In case you haven't noticed
Your body's got me focused
Just wanna let you know
My name's OmarionÂ, oh
It's nice to meet you
Baby girl, you're a keepa
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said, I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause you're a keepa
You're something special
Feeling you since I met you
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said, I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause you're a keepa
Girl, it's official, really
Really wanna get with you
Girl, like no other
Girl [Incomprehensible] tonight
Let's go somewhere quiet
Get to know each other more private
Whatever it is about you
Just feels so right, baby
I like your conversation
Just wanna take my time
And come over 'round you, girl
I gotta have you in my world
Come here, baby
It's nice to meet you
Baby girl, you're a keepa
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said, I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause you're a keepa
You're something special
Feeling you since I met you
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said, I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause you're a keepa, baby
Girl, I just can't get enough
Girl, I just can't get enough
'Cause you're a keepa
Girl, you got me burnin' up
And I just can't get enough
'Cause you're a keepa
Girl, I just can't get enough
Girl, I just can't get enough
'Cause you're a keepa
Girl, you got me burnin' up
Girl, you got me burnin' up
'Cause you're a keepa
The horns are making me horny
Sugar, darlin', I adore thee
These other girls are boring
Really don't got nothing for me
Freaky in the worst way
Me and Rick James got the same birthday
Simply means I'll grill you from Thursday to Thursday
7 days, 1 week, 168 hours
I got the power to make you shout
But now, I'll knock yo' ass sour
Scream, scream, permanent on the team
Like a Bantu or a Duke or a Just For Me
No lie, relax, lay down, you need a T-shirt
You can sleep in the bed with me
At the foot of the bed, with your feet first
And I will twirk you, [Incomprehensible]
You the only good smoking
Puffing better than purple, girl, I hope you fertile, girl
So we can have a baby boy or a baby girl
To Chuck E. Cheese's and Disney World
I'm just saying you're a keepa
From the day Big Boi was born
Till the day I see the Grim Reaper
I'm keepin' her
It's nice to meet you
Baby girl, you're a keepa
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said, I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause you're a keepa
You're something special
Feeling you since I met you
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said, I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause you're a keepa
It's nice to meet you
Baby girl, you're a keepa
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said, I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause you're a keepa
You're something special
Feeling you since I met you
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said, I'm never gonna let you go
'Cause you're a keepa
