[Verse 1]

9-1-1 gotta call, said hurry send the ambulance please
They ask me who was involved and I told them that the victim was me
Stabbed me in the back and left me on the street
Now who would do this to me?
I thought the suspect would get off clean
That's when they saw your fingerprints on the scene

[Chorus]
And as much as I don't wanna believe it
The evidence is plain to see
I don't wanna know the truth but I need it
And the jury finds you guilty, guilty oh
Of breaking my heart
You're guilty, guilty
Of murder in the third degree

[Verse 2]
Oh shorty's a criminal and I'd never seen it coming
Wouldn't have guessed it for a hundred years, years you did it
You even told me you admit, but I told them not my baby
That's what they told me that's been happening daily
Mmmh they threw the pictures out on the table, wanted to point you out but I wasn't able
'Cause I thought I fell in love with an angel
Never thought something so beautiful could be fatal


[Chorus]
And as much as I don't wanna believe it
The evidence is plain to see
I don't wanna know the truth but I need it
And the jury finds you guilty, guilty oh
Of breaking my heart
You're guilty, guilty
Of murder in the third degree


[Bridge]
Girl all the things you did to me
Should be a felony
They should lock you away and burn the key
Now all I do is sip Hennessy,to get rid of memories
Cause every thought of you brings misery

Girl all the things you did to me
Should be a felony
They should lock you away and burn the key
Now all I do is sip Hennessy, to get rid of memories
But I can't escape the fact that you're guilty, Yeah

[Chorus]
And as much as I don't wanna believe it
The evidence is plain to see
I don't wanna know the truth but I need it
And the jury finds you guilty, guilty oh
Of breaking my heart
You're guilty, guilty
Of murder in the third degree
