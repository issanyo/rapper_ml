[Verse 1]
The distance between our bodies
Make me feel like I want ya
Girl I feel like I want ya
The distance between our bodies
Girl you whine like a woah yeah
Put me gun in your holster
The distance between us

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Roll tide like Crimson
That's how I like my women
Like  I like my chicken
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Girl come closer to me
Girl come closer to me

[Chorus]
So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies
So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies, yeah
So much distance between us

[Verse 2]
Hit me on the phone
I be up late night talkin' like a smooth operator
Losin' all control
I need that poom-poom right now, ayy
Got me in the open
Like a drop top Chevy in the hood sittin' low
But I'm tryna put you in the Wraith
So girl don't get ghostin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Roll tide like Crimson
That's how I like my women
Like  I like my chicken
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Girl come closer to me
Girl come closer to me

[Chorus]
So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies
So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies, yeah
So much distance between us

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Roll tide like Crimson
That's how I like my women
Like  I like my chicken
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Girl come closer to me
Girl come closer to me

[Chorus]
So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies
So much distance between us
Distance between our bodies, yeah
So much distance between us
