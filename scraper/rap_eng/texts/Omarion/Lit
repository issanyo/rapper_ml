[Verse:]
Wake, Babe, you know you fire
Faith, waves, got me tired
Fry cry by design
Ah, ah, am I tied
Baby we ain’t got to be in love (no, no) [x2]
This is what we do, do...bring your girls
Bring em like a motherfucker
Pop on sip, we lit [[x2]
Let go, Let go, Let go
Ah, ah, ah
Let go, Let go, Let go
I heard you got the flame girl
Why you trying to play girl
Trying to run  away girl
Did you enjoy that? Hahahaha
