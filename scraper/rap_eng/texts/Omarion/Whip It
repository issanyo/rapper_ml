[Verse 1]
You know I'm a star, Akeem Olajuwon
Super foreign bitch, super foreign car
Floatin' in my Ghost, hold up don't approach
Hop up out that pretty motherfucker and I pose like

[Hook]
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip (whip)
Whip it whip it, whip (whip)
Whip it whip it, whip (whip)
Whip it whip it, whip it

[Verse 2]
Butt naked, what they in for
Hotel, presidential
Back seat of the rental
Hol' up, un momento
I always wanna hit it like a nympho
Tell me till you cop it baby, [?]
[???]
Smiling when you get it with your kinfolk
I said you're smiling when you get it with your kinfolk
Smiling when you get it with your kinfolk
I said you're smiling when you get it with your kinfolk

[Hook]
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip (whip)
Whip it whip it, whip (whip)
Whip it whip it, whip (whip)
Whip it whip it, whip it

[Bridge]
You know I'm a star, super foreign bitch
Floatin' in my Ghost, floatin' in my Ghost
Akeem Olajuwon
Hop up out that pretty motherfucker and I pose like

[Hook]
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
Whip it whip it, whip
