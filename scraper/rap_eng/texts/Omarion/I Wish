[Intro:]
Corna Boys
This feel real good right here man
It's a good look
I ain't mad at you (Omarion)
Sometimes I wish I didn’t know you but I’m glad I do (TUG)
(I, I) I ain't mad at you
Sometimes I wish I didn’t know you but I’m glad I do (I, I)
(I, I) I ain't mad at you
Sometimes I wish I didn't know you but I'm glad I do
(Sometimes I wish I didn’t know you but I’m glad I do)

[Verse 1:]
I shoulda
Known I (known I-I-I’d)
Fall in love with your game
Guess I had it coming
Now I
Can’t escape what I’m feeling inside
So ain’t no use in running
But (oh no)
I don’t know if you feeling me the same
You gotta tell me something (gotta tell me something)
Cause I don’t wanna be in love with a girl
Who’s way too busy fronting

[Pre-Hook:]
I wanna go back to when
To when you were just a friend
No complications
Not my heart's racing
When I see you baby
But it ain't the same cause now
I can’t resist your smile
You got me buggin
I’m caught off your lovin'
And I know it’s crazy but

[Chorus: 2x]
(I, I) I wish I didn’t love you (3x)
Like I doooo

[Verse 2:]
Baby
Sometimes
I try to act like it ain't what it is
Girl I gotta face it
Cause I (Cause I value all of the time that we shared)
And I don’t wanna waste it (I won't even waste it babe)
You got a hold on me that I can't shake
So I won't even fight it (no I won't even fight it)
Girl you keep a smile on my face
And I be so excited

[Pre-Hook:]

[Chorus: 2x]

[Bridge:]
If loving you is wrong and I ain't right
Cause I can’t leave you alone
Babygirl you have made my heart your home
It's forever you and me
So never leave
I said if loving you is wrong and I ain't right
Cause I can’t leave you alone
Babygirl you have made my heart your home
It's forever you and me
So never leave
Baby yeah

[Chorus: 2x]

[Outro]
(I, I) I ain't mad at you
Sometimes I wish I didn’t love you (I, I) but I’m glad I do
(I, I) I ain't mad at you
Sometimes I wish I didn’t know you but I’m glad I do
No noooo ohhh I
