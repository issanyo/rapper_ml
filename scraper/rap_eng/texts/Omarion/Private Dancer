[VERSE]
Curse them Vicky Secrets you wearing for making me feel so inferior
And curse that little bottle coco butter that blesses your exterior
(Woah)
I can see the way your lingerie is looking like it's tryina test me
And I don't like the way them dollar bills are sliding up and down your body
They make me so jealous but I can't help it
Girl just go and get it call me foolish or even selfish
But baby I can't fight the way I feel

[HOOK]
That pole should be my body
This floor should be my bed
And everything they throwin' at ya baby I'll double it
This club should be my crib
You're my private dancer
You're my private dancer
Throwin' 100'S when I should be throwin' 1's (x4)

[VERSE]
Girl I hate the way that your necklace is hanging like it's coming on to you
And I know that them earrings you wearing are whisperin' all the nasty things I wanna do to you
I can't help but feel a little angry 'bout that water bottle on your lips
And who gave you permission to get roses and that bible tattood on your hips
They make me so jealous but I can't help it
Girl just go and get it call me foolish or even selfish
But baby I can't fight the way I feel

[HOOK]

[VERSE]
Get mad when I know I should be having fun
Lately I've been trippin' thinkin' that you're the one
They make me so jealous but I can't help it
Girl just go and get it call me foolish or even selfish
But baby I can't fight the way I feel

[HOOK]
Throwin' 100'S when I should be throwin' 1's (X8)
