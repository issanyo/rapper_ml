Put your body on me
Put your body on me
Omarion (ahh yeah)
And your chick

Oh come get it
About to catch on my fly
Just come with it
Yeah come get it

You’re the only when I see
I’m just being honest
And I know you want to leave with me
Why you trying to hide it

Baby when we’re grinding
I get so excited
The way you’re feeling on me
Want you put me on

Put your body on me (yeah), on
Put your body on me (yeah), on
Put your body on me, put that on
Yeah yeah yeah

All nights just fine
Anytime is a good time
And pour a drink or two
Cause you know we got things to do
A little bit of this
A little that
Don’t you know I want you so bad
Cause I know what you’re thinking
But save that for later

Baby when we’re grinding
I get so excited
The way you’re feeling on me
Want you put me on

Put your body on me (yeah), on
Put your body on me (yeah), on
Put your body on me, put that on

Put your body on me (yeah), on

Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah
Put your body on me
