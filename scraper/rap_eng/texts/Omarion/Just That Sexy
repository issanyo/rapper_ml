Hey, yeah

(Verse 1)
Baby everytime you walk I get turned on
The way you're switching that thang, do it for me
The way that your lips move when you say my name
Whisper anything to me

(Bridge)
(All night)
You can rodeo for me (all night)
Get up on that O for me (it's alright)
Like ya supposed to be (so why?)

(Chorus)
So why you gotta be that sexy?
Sittin' up there knowin' you be that sexy
I'm already knowin' that your sex be, crazy
Always on my mind it's killin' me
'Cause your S.E.X is the most
You bring me down to my knees
From the bed to the floor
Oh girl I'm begging you please

Work with me, work, work with me
Oh work with me
Work with me ma
Baby you're just that sexy

(Verse 2)
Never get enough of you give me some more
I ain't gon' front, you're twistin' me out
Hmm Whatever it is they should sell it in the stores
Best believe they'd all be sold out

(Bridge)
(All night)
You can rodeo for me
(All night)
Get up on that hold (pole?) for me. (It's alright)
Like it's supposed to be. (So why?)

(Chorus)
So why you gotta be that sexy?
Sittin' up there knowin' you be that sexy
I'm already knowin' that your sex be, crazy
Always on my mind it's killin' me
'Cause your s.e.x. is the most
You bring me down to my knees
From the bed to the floor
Oh girl I'm begging you please

Work with me, work, work with me
Oh work with me
Work with me ma
Baby you're just that sexy

(O talking)

Witcha sexy dress on

Damn!

Work with me, work, work with me. (x4)

(Chorus)
Why you gotta be that sexy?
Sittin' up there knowin' you be that sexy
I'm already knowin' that your sex be, crazy
Always on my mind it's killin' me
'Cause your s.e.x. is the most
You bring me down to my knees
From the bed to the floor
Oh girl I'm begging you please

Work with me, work, work with me
Oh work with me
Work with me ma
Baby you're just that sexy

Work with me, work, work with me. (x4)
