[Intro:]
Thank you, thank you for coming
You could be with anyone else in the world
But you came with me

[Pre-Hook:]
Girl I'm so anxious for you
I've been so patient with you
We don't need to rush we can take our time
You and me, you and me, you and me

[Hook]
(Love, Love, Love)
Your hair done, and your nails done already
Your dress on, and your heels on already (Already)
(Love, Love, Love)
I don't know 'bout you girl but I'm ready
I'm ready. I'm ready

[Verse]
I can have a motherfuckin' helicopter scoop you from the water to the land, baby hold up
Breakfast in the morning more important bitches calling, I ignore it, who's the master?
Baby, sho' nuff
You telling me you might change
But I tell you not to
Baby you're a star, you're the one

[Pre-Hook:]
Girl I'm so anxious for you
I've been so patient with you
We don't need to rush we can take our time
You and me, you and me, you and me

[Hook]
(Love, Love, Love)
Your hair done, and your nails done already
Your dress on, and your heels on already (Already)
(Love, Love, Love)
I don't know 'bout you girl but I'm ready
I'm ready. I'm ready
