[Intro: Omarion]
Yeah, Omarion, Dutchboy

[Hook: Dutchboy]
Are you excited?
'Cause you invited
Roll up the doja
Twist it and light it
Lets shoot the moon
That's you, the pilot
Say that you leaving
I can't [?] you
One more drank
And I'll be talking this bitch
I've been gone (?)
I know some girls in the hills
Ten more bitches
And they just want to get in
They just want smoke weed
Tell your friends where they live

[Hook: Dutchboy]
