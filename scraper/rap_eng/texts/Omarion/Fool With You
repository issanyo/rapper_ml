Verse 1:
At the movies one night
Sportin apple bottom jeans and them gucci boots
Saw you walkin my way
With some M&M's and a Mountain Dew
The way you switch ya booty when you walk by
Ya handcuffed to a nigga but its alright
Girl before ya go (go)
Slide ya number on the low
I wanna-

Chorus*:
Fool With You
(are you down with that, with no strings attached, I wanna)
Fool With You
(keep it on the low, he ain't gotta know, I wanna)
Fool With You
(gotsta put it down, when yo man ain't around, I wanna)
Fool With You

Verse 2:
I see ya sittin real close
Got ya man on the side but we doin the most
Put my hand on yo thigh
So I can feel underneath your clothes
Ain't nobody knowin and it's so hot
Got a nigga goin baby don't stop
You'll be more than just a lover
But for now we undercover
*Chorus*

Verse 3:
Can sneak out the exit door
Go to the movies so he won't know
When we sip on the cris
I'll give you some of this
Be back before the credits roll
You know (you know), I know (I know), that you want me to grab that waist
'cause I know (I know), you know (you know), that I gotta get a taste
I really really gotta-
*Chorus*

Verse 4:
(Baby tonight I'll freak ya body right), I'm gonna freak ya body right
(I'm lovin them lips them hips them sexy thighs), Those sexy thighs
(Meet at my place so we ain't gotta hide), We ain't gotta hide so I can, (Fool With You), Fool With Your body honey
*Chorus*
