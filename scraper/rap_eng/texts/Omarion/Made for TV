[Verse 1]
Looking back on it all I-
(Wish you would've said something)
Before we got this far I- (And I wouldn't be caught up in)
Another situation that really got me breaking
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
I know

[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you see me) See me on music TV
(Your making money) Making money doing your thing
But I don't
I don't wanna up and leave and try to be with who the media says

[Chorus]
I don't want something that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
And I know everybody thinks that it
Might sound crazy but I
I love my baby, I can't leave her no
I don't want something that's
Made for TV (oh no I)
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
And I know that everybody thinks that it
Might sound crazy but I
I love my baby
I don't want something that's made...

[Verse 2]
I know you think I'm lying (Every time that I say)
I don't wanna see you crying all because of me oh
The thought of me and you is ill
But with her it's something real
And I can't let that go, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
(I know you see me) See me on music TV yeah
(Your making money) Making money doing your thing
But I don't wanna up and leave cause of something that the media says

[Chorus]
I don't want something that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
And I know everybody thinks that it
Might sound crazy but I
I love my baby, I can't leave her no
I don't want something that's
Made for TV (oh no I)
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
And I know that everybody thinks that it
Might sound crazy but I
I love my baby
I don't want something that's made...

[Bridge]
Made for TV (yeah yeah yeah did ya hear what I said)
Made for me (uh, girl it's gets a little crazy, yes it does)
Might sound crazy but I
I love my baby (huh, na na na na na na na naaaa)
Made for TV (aww yeah)
Made for me (you make me say awww yes)
Might sound crazy but I (you make me say aww yeah)
I love my baby ('cause I don't, 'cause I don't want something that's made for TV)
I don't want something that's made...

[Chorus]
I don't want something that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
And I know everybody thinks that it
Might sound crazy but I
I love my baby, I can't leave her no
I don't want something that's
Made for TV (oh no I)
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
And I know that everybody thinks that it
Might sound crazy but I
I love my baby
I don't want something that's made...

I don't want something that's made for TV
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
And I know everybody thinks that it
Might sound crazy but I
I love my baby, I can't leave her no
I don't want something that's
Made for TV (oh no I)
Rather fall in love with a girl that's made for me
And I know that everybody thinks that it
Might sound crazy but I
I love my baby
I don't want something that's made...
