INTRO
I don't know
Should I stay or should I go
(USHER: You Gotta make your move now lil homie) Yeah I know
It's Louso, its the remix (the remix)

FABOLOUS:

We been so strong, for so long
Where did we go wrong
For so long, I prolonged, until I said hold on
This is off the hook, Not a good look
True story yall, I dont write fiction books
Her two wrongs dont make right, but they make us even
You put my business in the street
Now this lake is leaving (lake is leaving)
I play my game (my game)
You play yo game (yo game)
Baby you can stay but I'll be M.I.A

VERSE 1:
When this began we were friends
She knew all my business (business)
Through all my good all my bad
Said that she was wit it (now)
I got memories (uh)
This is crazy (uh)
She ain't nothing like that girl I used to know
Didn't believe she would creep
Thought we was forever (ohh)
She broke out
I broke down
And that's just on the level (no)
Now these memories (oh)
They be haunting me (oh)
You ain't feelin me
My girls about to go

CHORUS 1:
Girl I really wanna work things out
Cuz I'm tired of fightin (if that dont' work)
And I really hope she still wants me the way I want her
(usher: you'll get your feelings hurt) (omarion:the way I want her)
Yeh I really wanna work this out
Damn girl I'm trying
Don't be so cold on these chicks, it's the remix (remix)

I got this icebox where my heart used to be(but i got this)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be(said I got it)
I'm so cold (x4)cold
I'm so cold (x3)
(But I got this)
I got this icebox where my heart used to be
(said i got this icebox where my heart used to be)nooo
I'm so cold (x4) cold
I'm so cold (x3)

Hold up now
Take your time
Let me get this right (o:uhuh)
Your trippin on what's in front of you
Cuz your lookin behind yah (o: yeh but i mean)
You got memories
Take it from me (yes)
She ain't nothin like ol girl you use to know (o:right)
Shorty's doin right by you
Maybe you should let it go (o:let me talk)
At the end of the day it ain't worth it
Wanna know how I know (omarion: how you know)
Remember confessions (o:yeh)
So you already know that it's gonna hurt
Shoulda learned your lesson
Homey
You don't really wanna feel the burn (noooooo)
Listen

CHORUS 2:
If you really wanna work it out then stop denyin (denyin)
Quit livin in the past
It's time you face the truth (truth)
If it's ever gonna work out

Stop blamin her when it's you
