Fussin' and fightin' we back at it again
I know that it's my fault you don't understand no
I got memories, this is crazy
You ain't nothin' like the girl I used to know
Good with mom, good with pop, cool with all my niggas (niggas)
I should try to decide, wanna let you in, but no
Damn these memories, and it's crazy
You ain't nothin' like the girl I used to know ohh
Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse
But I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Said I got this icebox where my heart used to be
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Said I got this icebox where my heart used to be
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
Why can't I get it right? Just can't let it go?
I opened up, shit let me down, I won't feel that no more
I got memories, this is crazy
She ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
I don't mean to take it out on you baby but I can't help it
Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it
And I, I apologize, for makin' you cry
Took me in my eyes and promise you won't do me the same
Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
It's no excuse, no excuse
I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Said I got this icebox where my heart used to be
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I got this icebox where my heart used to be
Said I got this icebox where my heart used to be
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
I don't wanna be stuck up in this cold cold world
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
I don't wanna be stuck off in this cold cold world
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl
Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
