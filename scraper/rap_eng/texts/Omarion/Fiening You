[Intro]
One of those
Kind of things
T.U.G
Listen (Baby Girls)

[Verse 1]
I’ve been noticing you been going in and out when you feel the need baby
But I can’t help but to wonder where
Where you are (aww no)
See I’ve done my dirt
Chasing all them skirts
All around the world I’ve done my do
But when it comes to you
I will loose my head
But it’s hard to sleep alone

[Chorus]
And I know when I’m away
You miss me all day
But driving me crazy girl I’m fiening you
But you leave me all alone
I’ll be back 4sho
Just so that you know girl I’m fiening you
When you need to be relaxed lay down on your back
Know who you can ask cuz I’m fiening you
Baby know all threw the day you keep me in my place
One thought of your face and I fiening you

[Verse 2]
When you’re not around
Baby girl I’m down and out cause I’m thinking about you (whoa)
(Are you creeping on me?) Baby just let me know
Who it is?, What it is? Right now
Fo it get real ugly
This situation bugs me
Tell me if you love me
Or if this means nothing (whoa)

[Chorus]

[Bridge: 2x]
You know what I’m about
I’m not just a thug
He’s tryna turn you out
I’m there for you girl, I’m found
What it is, said what it is
I wanna let you know that I’m fiening you

[Chorus]
