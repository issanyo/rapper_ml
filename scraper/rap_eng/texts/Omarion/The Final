[Intro: DJ Carisma & Omarion]
This that vibe, DJ Carisma and Omarion
Baby
DJ Swift

[Chorus: Omarion]
Only here for one night
She staring me down
Know I'm 'bout to catch a flight
So she turned turned around, merry go round
No time left, your concept
You know my flights
Girl, it's the final, final
Get undressed, 'bout to test those legs
Text me your address
It's the final, final

[Verse: Omarion]
Ooh this gon' be like it's supposed to be
Girl, you so bad, ain't no good for me
Show me the things you can do to me
This is your one opportunity
I got that thing, keep it company
Don't tell your boyfriend, know he come for me
Pull up to the function, I hop out like what the bloodclat?
I, I can paint your picture, have you posing for your shots
You realise that you mine when I recline ya, how I lay it down
Lay you down, I don't play around

[Bridge: Omarion]
Gotta get you on my lap, yeah
Shots of the Ameret'
Baby, you ain't gotta say, say no
Trust me, you can let go, woah

[Outro: Omarion]
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Lay you down, I don't play around
