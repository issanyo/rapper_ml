[Omarion]
Y'all ain't ready for this one! Woah!

[50 Cent]
Yeah!
You gon' like this one!
New 50 Cent!

[Omarion]
Omarion! Woah!

[50 Cent]
We call this one...

[Omarion]
What we call this?

[50 Cent]
"Ghetto Superstar!"

[Chorus: 50 Cent] + {Omarion}
Now I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know I'ma superstar
Now bitch come grab my bags be a part of my entourage (Super fly chick)
{Baby I want you to be my entourage}
{If you want then we could take this very far}

[Omarion]
Omarion! Let's Go!

[50 Cent]
Let's rock and roll baby, lock and load baby
You think I ain't runnin' the show run the show, you got to be crazy
I explode on the scene like crack in the 80's
Rather catch a slug, then let a nigga play me
I'm the don of New York, bow down to your highness
Or go against the grain and get moved on with llamas
Rappers keep sayin' they bringin' New York back
I ain't go no where, I am New York Jack!

[Omarion]
I don't need nobody else around see
Love the way you compliment my style
Though you may end up bein' my only girl
Cause when you're with me you're my whole world
Like when its just me and you
Vibe is crazy between us two
You're my homie my lover and even my friend
Now I said this before I'ma say it again

Now here is the situation
I like what we've got happenin'
And I don't want nothing comin' in between both me and you
I'll let you be lieutenant if you let me be captain
Tell me if that's cool

[Chorus: 50 Cent] + {Omarion}
Now I shouldn't have to tell you, you should know I'm a superstar
Now bitch come grab my bags be a part of my entourage (Super fly chick)
{Baby I want you to be my entourage}
{If you want then we could take this very far} (Super fly chick)

[Omarion]
You're a star in your own right
At times you steal the whole spotlight
I don't mind girl you're fine put a smile on my face
Besides who want a chick that no dude would chase
Sometimes I know you're unsure
Wonder if this will endure
Don't make me make a promise that I can't keep
Cause its cool how it is lets not complicate things girl

[50 Cent]
I'ma ghetto star, started out with less than nothin'
Got a little money now I'm on to somethin'
You know a special man need a special woman
The type before you call, she already comin'
You know the kind to listen when you tellin' her somethin'
First sign of a problem, she ain't runnin'
Buy her expensive shit, she don't want it
Sounds like I wouldn't need a prenup don't it? DAMN!

[Chorus: Omarion]
Baby I want you to be my entourage
(Super fly chick)
You could be my personal superstar
(Super fly chick)
Baby I want you to be my entourage
(Super fly chick)
If you want then we could take this very far
(Super fly chick)

[Omarion]
Omarion! 50 Cent!
Oh Yeah! T.U.G.!
G-Unit!

[50 Cent]
Now once I say G-Unit you should know just who we are
Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, Tony Yayo, 50 Cent, we the superstars
I want you to love me, I really do
