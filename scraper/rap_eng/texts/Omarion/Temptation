[Intro]
[Rosa Acosta]
Hi Papi

[Omarion]
Yea

[Rosa Acosta]
Necesito estar contigo

[Omarion]
So what you trying to do?

[Rosa Acosta]
Te aseguro que puedes confiar en mi

[Omarion]
Oh forreal?
Let me hit you right back then

[Verse 1]
Now this girl at work, she's on me really bad ya'll
And the looks she gives my girl, she be mad ya'll
She has no shame in her game
She lets it be known that she wants me, she wants me
She gently touched my arm as she walks by
The girl is dope and I cannot lie
But it's not worth the pain or the shame
And it's sure not worth losing my baby

[Chorus]
She's begging me, come over, over
I'm tempted to drive over, over
But if I do it's over, over
I got a girl at home
Temptations calling me
She's texting me come over, over
I'm tempted to walk over, over
But if I do it's over, over
I got a girl at home
Temptations calling me
Temptations, temptations
Temptations, temptations
Temptations, temptations
([Rosa Acosta spoken]
Omarion, you're so, ooh, you're so good)
Her body keeps calling me, her body keeps calling me
([Rosa Acosta spoken]
I want you so bad)

[Verse 2]
Now my momma used to warn me about these types of girls
How they break up happy homes and they do it well
And their style is to kiss and never tell
What goes around comes around
She whispers in my ear
([Rosa Acosta spoken]
You should come see me)
She whispers in my ear
([Rosa Acosta]
Nu-uh, I won't tell)
[Omarion]
She whispers my ear
She's telling me to come, come over
([Rosa Acosta]
But you need to hurry up)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Got my baby waiting at home, so I can tap
Aight, I'm coming home to you baby
You know I love you even though she bad
Even though I heard it's good, I'm all good
Yea
