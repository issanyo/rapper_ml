[Verse 1: Travis]
Don't know where to start 'cause something ain't going right
Feel it in my soul 'cause I've tried, oh baby
Tried to keep you satisfied, please don't cry
I just think we both need time

[Pre-Hook]
I just feel that we are in the same room
But live in two worlds apart
And it's causing too much pain

[Chorus]
(She said) 'Baby can you please just stay?
It ain't too late to work this thing out'
(I said) 'Girl, this ain't easy for me
At least the truth is coming out'
(She said) 'Why can't we make up like the last time?
I'm just afraid to hear you say go'
(I said) 'Baby I'm sorry
I think it's time we let go'

[Post-Hook]
Baby don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Tell me you'll stay and you'll stay and you'll stay
I gotta leave, gotta leave, gotta leave
'Cause I think it's time we let go

[Verse 2: Kevin]
See those teardrops falling from your eyes (From your eyes)
That don't change my mind, oh baby
Please don't make things more difficult than they gotta be
I can't take no more, this is killing me

[Pre-Hook]
And every time I look at you
I see more reason for me to leave you
And it's causing me too much pain, yeah

[Chorus]
(She said) 'Baby can you please just stay?
It ain't too late to work this thing out'
(I said) 'Girl, this ain't easy for me
At least the truth is coming out'
(She said) 'Why can't we make up like the last time?
I'm just afraid to hear you say go'
(I said) 'Baby I'm sorry
I think it's time we let go'

[Post-Hook]
Baby don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Tell me you'll stay and you'll stay and you'll stay
I gotta leave, gotta leave, gotta leave
'Cause I think it's time we let go

Baby don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Tell me you'll stay and you'll stay and you'll stay
I gotta leave, gotta leave, gotta leave
'Cause I think it's time we let go (Time that we let go)

[Chorus]
(She said) 'Baby can you please just stay?
It ain't too late to work this thing out'
(I said) 'Girl, this ain't easy for me
At least the truth is coming out'
(She said) 'Why can't we make up like the last time?
I'm just afraid to hear you say go'
(I said) 'Baby I'm sorry
I think it's time we let go'

[Post-Hook]
Baby don't leave, don't leave, don't leave
Tell me you'll stay and you'll stay and you'll stay
I gotta leave, gotta leave, gotta leave
'Cause I think it's time we let go
