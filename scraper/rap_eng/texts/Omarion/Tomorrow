[Verse 1:Omarion]
Sometimes cupid doesn't hit you and her at the same time
Sometimes it takes love a while to wipe the tears from her eyes
I know you been hurt before so baby girl I don't mind
Baby you're first to fall in love waiting at the finish line
I know you've got trust issues
But one day you will trust me
I've broken my [?]
But one day you will love me
So girl I wait on you
One day I get lucky
So you ain't gotta love me now, love me now
But someway, somehow you will

[Hook:Omarion]
Love me tomorrow
Wherever your heart goes I'll follow
Girl just love me tomorrow
Wherever your heart goes I'll follow, follow
Loving you, is all I wanna do
Loving you, is all I wanna do
Loving you, is all I wanna do
You can love me tomorrow, you can love me tomorrow
But girl, girl..

[Verse 2:Omarion]
I know patience is a virtue
So girl I give it time
I'll be closer in the morning
Than I will be tonight
Everyday the walls are falling
And I'm closer inside
So girl believe me when I say, believe me when I say
You're an angel in disguise
I know you've got trust issues
But one day you gonna trust me
I've broken my [?]
But one day you will love me
So girl I wait on you
One day I get lucky
So you ain't gotta love me now, love me now
But someway, somehow you will

[Hook:Omarion]

[Verse 3:Czar]
Ah, she going to love me tomorrow
Why not? I'm hot as David Navarro
Just playing my part as sweet sorrow
Loving with thy the limit when every minute is borrowed
What you mean you did it for us?
Taking the whole pie, leaving me with the crust
When her mood swing, then I have to adjust
Forever the king of hearts I'm sick in your royal flush

[Verse 4:Casey Veggies]
Yeah, you gonna love me tomorrow
I'm just a dreamer and my mind be up in the stars
A lot of scenes in my dreams it's just me and you
At the [?] closed off we rendezvous
Yeah I wake up all the time just thinking it's true
So I gotta call you up, and tell you come through
She at the supper club, and trying to fall in love
Just trying to have a good time all of the above
