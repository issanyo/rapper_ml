[Verse 1]
I remember my heart was feeling cold and
Dark clouds were rolling in
Told me to pull over
The you told me to get over it yeah
Don't need the phone light
Girl it's too thick to see through
Stopping at the wrong light
Girl ain't no need to speed through
Nah they can't see ya
But even if they could
Still couldn't see us
Your love is like the sun
Girl you know I need ya
Way too thick to let go
Hands off my heater
But you could put it back on my neck though

[Hook]
I love your steam
Rising off your body like a dream
High with no smoke
Even if they come close
They'd never know

[Bridge]
Cold feels so lonely
But it brings you close to me
Baby I can keep you warm
But if you don't take off your clothes
We'll never know

[Verse 2]
I like the way you ride
You like the way that I drive it
They compliment my ride
Don't know what's going on inside it
You said my love's a crime
That's why you feel so excited
Girl you cannot deny it
You're feeling closed in
Well you should let me inside it
I got your open and undivided
Attention on me now
It's cold in here
Call me sensitive
That's what I can give, oh

[Hook]
I love your steam
Rising off your body like a dream
High with no smoke
Even if they come close
They'd never know

[Bridge]
Cold feels so lonely
But it brings you close to me
Baby I can keep you warm
But if you don't take off your clothes
We'll never know, yeah, oh

[Outro]
I love your, oh
Oh baby, love your..
Love your steam
Like a dream, it was all a dream
