[Intro]
Yea
All this time I been waitin'
To get you in this room alone
Now you're here it's time
Listen

[Verse 1]
This can't be real
The time has come
For us to do our thing
What I mean by do our thing is
Come in and shut the door
Your phone ring then press ignore
I'ma give you what you waitin' for
I am so anxious but a little nervous
I know that you're the one
So I can't explain what you do to me
So turn off the lights
Lets make it right
Girl I wanna take it yeah

[Chorus]
In the dark
We can get touchy feely
I'ma make sure you feel me
Girl I can't wait to get us
In the dark
This time can't be wasted
Girl I'm tryna taste it
Baby come and meet me
In the dark
Don't be afraid when I touch you
I just wanna love you
We can get busy
In the dark
It's time to get our grind on
Baby don't be shy no
All these things can happen
In the dark

[Verse 2]
Don't want to complicate the situation
So I'ma try my best to make it comfortable for you
Girl you won't believe what's happenin'
You gon' feel like a virgin again
Guarantee you come back again
One, we don't need no candle lights
Two, the moon is shinin' bright
Three, Baby all I need is your legs wrapped around me
Four, we don't got no time for games
Five, I wanna hear you scream my name
Six, Cause it's time for me to slip myself up into you

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
All day I've been waitin'
Oh for you girl
Gonna take you
Gonna take you on this ride
I'm gonna show you how I get down
Gonna show you how I get down
I know that things will happen
If you don't know baby I will
Tomorrow we gon' do it again
And again and again and again
But there's one more thing that I gotta tell you
Please don't tell nobody what we do

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Now its really time
In the dark
For everything to happen between me and you in a special place
In the dark
Yea
