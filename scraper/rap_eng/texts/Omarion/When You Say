[Verse 1: Jay 305]
I'm a baller, baby
September 4th, just like Beyoncé, baby
Save the small talk, girl, I ain't no counsellor
Hit the 10, free, pay see you bounce it, so bounce it
I know you heard about Jay through your father probably
Got a couple R&B bitches in my pocket
Left the studio with ScHoolboy Q
Now I'm tryna see what's up with you
I tried to told you, girl, I tried to warn ya
Have you wish that you live in California
Upset, it's a hell of a view
Got you sayin' I'm in love with you
But that's all, yeah, you played yourself
I was gon' work, work, work but you played yourself
So I'm ready to go when you ready
But first I got somethin' to say, baby

[Chorus: Omarion]
When you say you love me, it don't mean a thing
I'm just doing what I do but I'll make it up to you, baby
When you say you love me, it don't mean a thing
Ride it like a bull when you climb on top, girl, you know I'ma give you all I got
I'ma pick you in the foreign
A couple shots of Patrón, we pourin'
Who that nigga on your phone? Ignore him
Tell him you be back home in the mornin', mornin'

[Verse 2: Jay 305]
Ooh, I'm back at it
Baby so thick, movin' fire traffic
Had to hit the backstreets for my lil' freak
GPS at 35, I be dead 3
Got a full tank of gas and the AC blowin'
Smellin' good, feelin' good 'cause the money keep comin'
I'ma get up in that thang while I'm palmin' your ass
I see you feelin' yourself, I gotta tell you somethin'
I'ma let you hold me on your front team, yeah
But really you ain't sayin' nothin', yeah
But I'm ready to go when you ready
But first I got somethin' to say, baby

[Chorus: Omarion]
When you say you love me, it don't mean a thing
I'm just doing what I do but I'll make it up to you, baby
When you say you love me, it don't mean a thing
Ride it like a bull when you climb on top, girl, you know I'ma give you all I got
I'ma pick you in the foreign
A couple shots of Patrón, we pourin'
Who that nigga on your phone? Ignore him
Tell him you be back home in the mornin', mornin'
