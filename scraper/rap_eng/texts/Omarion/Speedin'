[Verse 1:]
When I looked over my shoulder
It got a little bit colder
It’s like I lost love from an angel
And now I’m feeling like a stranger
Abandon, I’m stranded
I gotta get back to you
I called triple A
They say they on their way
Times ticking fast
Gotta see you today

[Hook:]
But if my time is up
Let me know right now
I will find a way
To your heart again
So I’m speedin
I’m speedin (Whoa)
Speedin’
I’m speedin’

[Post Hook:]
Ugh, ugh, ooh, whoa whoa whoa
Ugh, ugh, ooh, whoa whoa whoa

[Verse 2:]
Ight, no time to be impatient
Just got the confirmation
And now I’m flying down the highway
She’s crying, "Try love my way"
I’m with it (so with it)
Committed
To ride away with you, girl
And give you what you need
More than your eyes could ever see

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
Times moving fast but not fast enough so I’m speedin’, speedin’
I’m raced and fast but not fast enough so I’m speedin, speedin’
I’m doing 90 down the highway (highway)
Gotta make this turn, I’ll be there right away, baby
Hop out the car, I’m at your door
Open it up and there you go
I gotta scoop you in my arms

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Oh, oh ho oh ahhh
Oooh oh ho oh oh ohh WHOA!
Speedin’
I’m speedin’ (x5)
Ohh, oh oh ohhhh
Speedin’
I’m speedin’
