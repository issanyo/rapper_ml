[Verse 1]
Drunk off emotion
Lost in the moment
Two guns, we smokin'
Wraith, now we're ghostin'
P.C. we coast there
Sex in the ocean
Promises broken
All over nothin', yeah

[Bridge]
Have you ever lost someone that you cared about?
Wished that the chance would ever come back around?
Said we were ride or die, but couldn't hold it down
Don't we all have our reasons, to run away?

[Chorus]
Word for word
You got my soul
I
Don't you let me go
Why lie?
You've got control
I, I, I, I

[Verse 2]
Ass lookin' fatter, like you J-Lo (Ok, though)
Why you actin' like you got a halo? (Halo)
Girl, I know you know I need to let go (Let go, hungover you)
It ain't really over 'til we say so, say so
'Cause I wanna know...

[Bridge]
Have you ever lost someone that you cared about?
Wished that the chance would ever come back around?
Said we were ride or die, but couldn't hold it down
Don't we all have our reasons, to run away?

[Chorus]
Word for word
You got my soul
I
Don't you let me go
Why lie?
You've got control
I, I, I, I
