[Verse 1: Omarion]
There’s a couple things that I’d do to make you lose your mind
I be all in your head, we up in your bed at the same time
You got me, you don’t even know it prolly cause I don’t even show it
Gotta keep you on your toes, that marble floor so cold
Let me touch you then let me take it
God you so erratic, you ain’t even naked
Had you on the table, took you to the floor
Your body wasn’t able to handle anymore
I taste your lovin, I go crazy
And I ain’t never had another woman phase me
She will never know cause I keep it in control
That’s why I got you comin back for more oh oh

[Pre-Hook]
First you get in my bed, then you dim the lights
Then I get you wet, like sure we’re doin right
Gotta put it down like a first payment
Make it sound good as you say amen
Tell you want my lead, you want me to stay in
But I ain’t going nowhere, I just wanna hear you say

[Hook]
Don’t go, say don’t go
Please don’t go, baby don’t go
There’s somethin' 'bout the way when you drop down naked
When you say don’t go, don’t go
Uh you turn me on... don’t go!
I wanna hear you tell me don’t
Want you to tell me don’t go, go, go

[Verse 2: Omarion]
I’m not ego trippin', that’s not my mission
I just wanna put my key in your ignition
And drive you, and drive you
Don’t wanna do you like them other guys do
An I’ll make sure you’ll get yours before I get mine
See it’s more important that I get your mind
Cause when you’re cryin' for me and you get lonely
Said I wanna be your only one you’d call

[Pre-Hook]
