Oooohh
Why you fakin?

Look it's the D-I
Double G-Y from the empire
That's N-Y
Yea
It go like this, it go like this
It go like, it go like
Ok

[Verse 1: Diggy]
Baby I ain't nothing like your old dude
Everybody got a past but that's old news
I'm the only one that know the shit you go through
I just want you to be treated how you s'posed to
Your ex nigga was a clown
Came straight out the circus
But I can make you feel good
I can make you feel nervous
You fine with the natural hair
You ain't got to perm it
I be over your crib so much I got a parking permit
So baby how you think you running game?
On the same nigga that run the game
You know I got more pull than what's his name
I make P. Water pull up on him, go and run his chain
You know it's like that
You text a nigga I hit right back

Cause we a book and it's only the first chapter
I'm tryna cuff you before I spell cuff backwards

[Chorus: Omarion and (Diggy)]

Cause girl I know you (you) want me
Baby girl you the one
(Baby you the one)
Baby girl you the one
(Baby you the one)
And baby I know you want me
Baby girl you the one, (you the one)
The one (you the one), the one (baby you the one)

[Ty Dolla $ign and (Diggy)]

Why you always get the fakin?
(You be fakin)
Baby you be hella fakin?
(Why you fakin?)
Fakin like you don't want this
(You know you want it)
Thinking that I won't notice
(You know I notice)
And baby I know
Oh you want me
Baby you be fakin
(Be fakin)
Fakin
(Be fakin)
Fakin
(Tell me why you fakin?)
Yea, yea

[Verse 2:Diggy]
Fakin like you don't be twatching me on Twitter
Fakin like I'm just like every other nigga
Fakin like I won't get you that bag you want
Fakin like I don't know how to turn you onnn
Baby I ain't fakin it's facts
Take you to Barney's
See the garments that ain't dropped in the back
Get you whatever you want and put a smile on your face
Show you that penthouse view
Look at the clouds when you wake, when you wake
I do shit your girls can't say that they saw already
Cause I'm a nigga that ain't ordinary
I promise to you that I'm more than ready
And if you have my baby we wouldn't need Maury or Jerry
You know you like that
So how could you ever fight that?

Cause we a book and it's only the first chapter
I'm tryna cuff you before I spell cuff backwards

[Chorus: Omarion and (Diggy)]

Cause girl I know you (you) want me
Baby girl you the one
(Baby you the one)
Baby girl you the one
(Baby you the one)
And baby I know you want me
Baby girl you the one, (you the one)
The one (you the one), the one (baby you the one)
