[Verse 2: Soulja Boy]
Baby, I been thinking lately so much about you
Everything about you, I like it, I love it
Kissing you in public, thinking nothing of it
Roses by the dozen, talking on the phone
Baby you so sexy, your voice is so lovely
I love your complexion, I miss ya, I miss ya, I miss ya
I really wanna kiss you but I can't
Six, seven, eight, triple nine, eight, two, one, two

[Chorus: Sammie]
Baby, you know that I miss you, I wanna get with you tonight
But I cannot baby girl and that's the issue
Girl, you know I miss you, I just wanna kiss you

Kiss me thru the phone (kiss me thru the phone)
See you when I get home (when I get home)
