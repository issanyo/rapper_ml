[Intro]
Matters is crazy, it's whatever, whatever
All day yeah, it's whatever, whatever
Oh, oh-ohh, oh, oh, oh, oh-ohhh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I've been only single four months
I'm just tryna get my swag back
Probably try to catch a few kids
It's like I never let 'em ride back
Torn apart, catch me, I'm on the run
Told my BM she can have that
Put that on my daughter and my son
Every night I'm having flashbacks

[Hook]
So it's probably wise that you know that I'm on
You don't cross the line
Fuck your glass of wine
It's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever, it's whatever
It's whatever, it's whatever-whatever, it's whatever

[Verse 2]
I musta did it to myself
Look unfamiliar to myself
You don't remember what you did
I can do bad all by myself
I had to put this shit on record
I'm probably better by myself
I had to put this shit on record
Just so you can get the message

[Hook]
So it's probably wise that you know that I'm on
You don't cross the line
Fuck your glass of wine
It's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever
It's whatever, know we on, it's whatever, whatever, it's whatever
It's whatever, it's whatever-whatever, it's whatever

[Bridge]
I musta did it to myself
Look unfamiliar to myself
You don't remember what you did
I'm probably better by myself
Whatever, whatever, whatever
You like to talk 'bout forever
Talk 'bout what's right for once, yeah
[?]
So far, can't turn back now
I guess we found out no basic
[?]

[Outro]
So usually around this time I'd drop a mixtape way back. You know and the truth of the matter is that I'm putting my soul into my next album. Make it a true reflection of now and I can't wait for you to hear it so
