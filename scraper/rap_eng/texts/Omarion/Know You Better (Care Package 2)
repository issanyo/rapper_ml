[Intro: Omarion]
Haha, yeah, I'mma let it ride
I'm just tryna know you better

[Verse 1: Omarion]
Tell me what's your name, tell me, tell me what's your sign
Tell me what you into, tell me, tell me what you like
If you was rich tomorrow tell me what would you do with it?
And if you could see the future, baby do you see me in it?
Would you date me for a minute, girl before you let me hit it?
Are you single? are you taken? working towards your education?
I'm just askin', I'm just sayin, what's your current situation?
Cause I see you 'cross the room and you the baddest in the building, what's up?

[Bridge: Omarion]
See I don’t wanna get into your draws yet (oh yeah)
Are you one of them girls that’s askin' where the bread's at? (Oh yeah)
See first I need to know the way your head at
Before you give me some (heh, I’m playin')

[Hook: Omarion]
I’m just tryin' to know you, better
I’m just tryin' to know you, yeah
I’m just tryin' to know you, better
I’m just tryin' to know you, yeah-eah-eah
If I told you my secret, shawty would you keep it?
Are you the type to kiss me right after I eat it, yeah?
I’m just tryin' to know you better

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Tell me where you goin', tell me, tell me where you from
Are you a smoker or a drinker? Are you none of the above?
Are you more domesticated? Do you love to hit the club?
Tell me do you like to fuck, or do you just like making love?
Tell me do you have some kids? And if so girl, how many?
And if not, then shawty tell me, can I be your baby daddy?
I’m just playin less you let me, I won’t know unless you tell me
I just gotta ask cause girl you super bad
What’s up?

[Verse 3: Nipsey Hussle]
Can't be one of them all arguin'
Can't be wonderin' what car I'm in
Game I play, there's no part for them
Silent bitch, I got heart for them
Can't be one of them old blow-me-ups
Can't be one of them old quick-to-fucks
Can't be one of them old number one's
Think you running game
You ain't slick enough
Can't be on of them old fall-in-love's
Can't be one of them drunk-in-the-club
Can't be tryna fuck with a boss
When your Ex nigga's a fucking scrub
Can't be one of them old hate-your-daddy's
Can't be one of them gone make me slacking
Could be one of them gon' pull your own weight
You glossing up, I can't wait to match it
Teach you new game and make you happy
Pick your shoe game
You ain't the average
Make 'em lighter cause your face immaculate
And your purse is matchin'
Yo shape is savage
Can't be one of them old easy fucks
Think it's cool but you a pretty slut
Cause there's niggas in it that's really us
So before I hit, we gon' chop it up
