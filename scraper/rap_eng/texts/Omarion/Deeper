[Intro: James Fauntleroy and Omarion]
This is gonna take, some getting use to
Some getting use to

[Verse 1: Omarion]
Hittin' you up and then pickin' you up
And then hittin' the beach till like four
Soon as I get to my door
Got your hands down on my dance down  on my sand down on my floor
Cuz it's up in my bedroom, wave slow to your body
Eyes are asking for more and more and more

[Pre-hook 1: Omarion]
I'm up on your shore, If you need me to rescue, I'll be there for sure
Head first girl I'm diving, your water is so pure
All I want is a little more

[Hook]
I'm not afraid to go in
Even though this is getting deep
Yeah, it's getting deep girl
It's getting deeper, shit gets deep when you're in love
Let's go deeper

[Verse 2]
No stoppin' you, clothes' optional, towels' onto the door
Roll up then we soar, I'm so in love with you
That's why the whole room looks like a storm
Bathing suit in my bedroom, don't know what that's for
Eyes are asking for more and more and more

[Pre-hook 2]
All up when you're sure, If you need me to rescue, I'll be there for sure
Head first girl I'm diving, your water is so pure
All I want is a little more

[Hook]
I'm not afraid to go in
Even though this is getting deep
Yeah, it's getting deep girl
It's getting deeper, shit gets deep when you're in love
Let's go deeper

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
Hell yeah, girl I'm ready
I'm ready for, ready for
Hell yeah, girl I said it
I'm ready for, ready for you
Hell yeah, let's get married
I'm ready for, ready for whatever
Right in front of the whole city
Hell yeah, girl I'm ready
I'm ready for, ready for
Hell yeah, girl I said it
I'm ready for, ready for you
Hell yeah, let's get married
I'm ready for, ready for whatever
Right in front of the whole city

[Hook]
I'm not afraid to go in
Even though this is getting deep
Yeah, it's getting deep girl
It's getting deeper, shit gets deep when you're in love
Let's go deeper
I'm not afraid to go in
Even though this is getting deep
Yeah, it's getting deep girl
It's getting deeper, shit gets deep when you're in love
Let's go deeper
Let's go deeper

[Bridge: James Fauntleroy]
