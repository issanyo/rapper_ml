[Hook: Omarion]
Baby you're all of mines
So we can leave on all the lights
I'mma love you all the time
Like I've been waiting all my life

[Verse 1: King Los]
He forgot how to love you
I remember your secrets
But act like I forgot 'em
Yeah, that's how solid I keep it
I can feel your vibe through every wall in this room
Cause I orbit your moon frequently
I'm in tune with your frequency
Freaking you like I'm Jodeci
Things that you haven't said
Fall out you as I enter your love like a Jagged Edge
Let's get married, meet me at the altar
After all, at the altar, is where altercations get buried
All the hatred and worry, afraid she's wasting her time
Cause time and patience may vary, if complications involved
Conversations get scary, let's make them all jealous
We  should listen to music and do shit the stars tell us, like
We should take a walk through the galaxy cause you balance me
Love the way that you challenge me, I could make all your fantasies life

[Outro: King Los (Omarion)]
Do you believe your perception of seeking for more perfection
Reaching in your direction cause
(Girl I love you cause you half of me
What you have for me, takes a hold of me gradually
We could defy the gravity, twice)

[Hook: Omarion]
Baby you're all of mines
So we can leave on all the lights
I'mma love you all the time
Like I've been waiting all my life
