[Verse 1]
You to fly to be workin', workin', workin'
You to fly to be workin, workout, workout
Got me going back to kinko's
Back to Kinko's back to Kinko's
You can throw me another free throw, free throw, yeah

[Hook]
Ooo Last night, last night
When I put you on the copy machine
Body printed out so right, so right
Yeah mami, can we do it the same?
Just like last night, last night
When I put you on the copy machine
Body printed out just right, just right
Ooh mama, can we do it the same?
Just like last night, last night
Just like last night, last night
When I put you on the copy machine

[Verse 2]
This photo you ain't never gotta work
Never gotta work, never gotta work
Ooh a little exposure ain't never gonna hurt
Never gonna hurt you
U got me shootin' like porno, porno, porno, porno, porno
Bitch stick to me just like a bag of fritos, fritos, fritos, fritos, yeah

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Baby, just last night you was just lookin' so right
I ain't try to put up no fight
I had them legs up, Lamborghini Suicide
Body so fly, I just had to scan you
Put you on my hard drive
Why? Cus last night

[Hook]
