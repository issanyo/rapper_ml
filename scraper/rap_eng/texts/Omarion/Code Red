[Intro]
Omarion, yup, 253!
It's a code red, a code red
A code red, i'ts a code red

[Verse 1]
I get the girls that's pretty in face
Real nice booty, still skinny in the waist
I like the way she move when she shake it in my face
(It's a code red when we move up in the place)

Steady coming in and they all got friends
Couldn't be the alcohol, it's the beauty to blame
Pop this bottle, passing out rose
(It's to many girls, VIP is going crazy)

[Chorus]
Like race cars, we stopping them
Like Cop cars
A code Red, a code Red, a code Red
It's a code red

[Verse 2]
Steeze so fresh, lil mama's like "Wow!"
Baby I'm a king, I'm a hand you this crown
Number one lady, baddest chick in the city
(They all look witty, it's about to get silly)

Trapped in the corner, baby putting on me
I'm coppin hella feels, I can tell that she want me
(She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to momma
First you get the name, and then you get the number)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
(She's a very freaky girl, don't bring her to momma
First you get the name, and then you get the number)

[Chorus x2]
