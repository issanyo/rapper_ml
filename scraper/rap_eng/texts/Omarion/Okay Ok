[Hook : C'Zar]
Okay, ok, ok…
Okay, ok, ok..
My way, I say, I say…
Yo way,no way, jose…
Okay, ok, ok…
Souffle, who play, who play?
One time, a ball way up
I can who lie you up

[Verse : Omarion]
We was talking head shots
Bouta check the weather
Had to make a pit stop
Had to kick a bitch out
Tell her take a picture
And it could make ya richer

[Bridge : Omarion]
I could fuck around
I could fuck around
You can set it up
Ima knock it down
But ima fuck around
Ima fuck around

[Hook : C'Zar]
Okay, ok, ok…
Okay, ok, ok..
My way, I say, I say…
Yo way, no way, jose…
Okay, ok, ok…
Souffle, who play, who play?
One time, a ball way up
I can who lie you up
