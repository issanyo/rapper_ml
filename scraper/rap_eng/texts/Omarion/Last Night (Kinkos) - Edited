You too fly to be workin' in
Workin' in, workin' in
You too fly to be workin' in
Work out, work out

Got me goin' back to Kinko's
Back to Kinko's, back to Kinko's
Just so you could throw me another free-throw
Free-throw, yeah

Last night, last night
When I put you on the copy machine
Body braided out, so nice, so nice
Yeah, mama can we do it the same?

Just like last night, last night
When I put you on the copy machine
Body braided out just right, just right
Ooh, mama can we do it the same?

Just like last night, last night
Just like last night
When I put you on the copy machine

This photo, you ain't never gotta work
Never gotta work, never gotta work
A little exposure never gonna hurt
Never gonna hurt you

You got me shootin' like a porno
Porno, porno
Bitch stick to me just like a bag of Frito's
Frito's, yeah

Last night, last night
When I put you on the copy machine
Body braided out, so nice, so nice
Yeah, mama can we do it the same?

Just like last night, last night
When I put you on the copy machine
Body braided out just right, just right
Ooh, mama can we do it the same?

Just like last night, last night
Just like last night
When I put you on the copy machine

Baby, just last night
You was just lookin' so right
I ain't tryin' to put up no fight
I had them legs up Lamborghini suicide

Body so fly, I just had to scan you
Put you on my hard drive, why?

'Cause last night, last night
When I put you on the copy machine
Body braided out, so nice, so nice
Yeah, mama can we do it the same?

Just like last night, last night
When I put you on the copy machine
Body braided out just right, just right
Ooh, mama can we do it the same?

Just like last night, last night
Just like last night
When I put you on the copy machine
