Hold on, looking at my watch think its time to head out, gotta throw some clothes on..
Im your entertainment what you tryna do tonight?
Its all up to you girl, and I can garentee that you will have a good time
Baby you know you are.. a star and we can kick it..

[Chorus]
Baby what do you say
If you wanna ride, come on baby girl its nothing
We could make this a date, you can spend the night
No tellin what we're gonna do late, what do you say babe..
We could talk about the birds and the bees and being grown..
So what do you say lady

You on my level I like us together and thats straight from the heart..
Let me know cuz girl im ready whenever you are..

I could take you to the beach, moonlight black sand underneath your feet
Roll around on the ground like we in the sheets
Who knows when we gone sleep? The hell with the time baby

[Chorus]
Baby what do you say
If you wanna ride, come on baby girl its nothing
We could make this a date, you can spend the night
No tellin what we gone do late, what do you say babe..
We could talk about the birds and the bees and being grown..
So what do you say lady
Trust me, cuz knowing me is not enough..

Constant paradise, what you dont know
You can count on me.. what a time it would be
