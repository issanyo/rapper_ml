[Hook: Tha Clip]
Man I really wanna kill this douche cause I'm tired of dying
My castle turned into wooden planks because of you
Man I really wanna kill this douche cause I'm tired of dying
I'm mad at you (mad at you)
I've got these Ice Blocks where my house used to be
I've got these Ice Blocks where my house used to be
It got old, it got old, it got old
Nooo
It got old, it got old, it got old
I've got these Ice Blocks where my house used to be
I've got these Ice Blocks where my house used to be
It got old, it got old, it got old
Nooo
It got old, it got old, it got old

[Verse One: Tha Clip]
Arching and fighting with white eyed Herobrine
I know I got the mod, you don't understand
I had diamonds
Now I'm crying
I lost it all to Stevie's long lost bro
Made a sword, made armor to try to kill him
Didn't have to open my door to let you in (no)
You just multiplied
Right before my eyes
You sent all my stuff to where only Notch knows

[Repeat hook]
