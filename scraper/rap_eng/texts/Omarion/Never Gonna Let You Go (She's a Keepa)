[Verse 1: Omarion]
Second you caught my eye
Girl I couldn't deny
That you got me on fire baby
(Some' 'bout the way you walk)
I just can't get enough
Girl you got that good stuff
I think I'm losing my mind
Girl can we just talk baby yea

[Bridge 1: Background Singers & (Omarion)]
In case you haven't noticed
Your body's got me focused
Just wanna let you know
(My name's Omarion oh)

[Hook]
It's nice to meet ya
Baby girl, you're a keeper
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said I'm never gonna let you go
Cause you're a keeper
You're something special
Feeling you since I met you
And I'm never gonna let you go
Said I'm never gonna let you go
Cause you're a keeper

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Girl it's official
Really, really wanna get with you
You're like no other
(Girl that's dancing tonight)
Let's go somewhere quiet
Get to know each other more private
Whatever it is about ya
Just feels so right baby

[Bridge 2: Background Singers & (Omarion)]
I like your conversation
Just wanna take my time and
Learn more about you girl
(I gotta have you in my world, come here baby!)

Girl I just can't get enough
Girl I just can't get enough
Cause you're a keepa
Girl you got me burnin' up
And I just can't get enough
Cause you're a keepa

[Verse 3: Big Boi]
The horns are making me horny
Sugar darlin' I adore thee
These other girls are boring, really don't got nothing for me
Freaky in the worst way, me and Rick James got the same birthday
Simply means I'll drill you from Thursday to Thursday
Seven days, one week, one hundred sixty eight hours
I got the power to make you shout, but not like your ass sour
Cream, scream, permanent on the team
Like a Bantu, or a duke, or a (Just for me!)
No lie, relax, lay down, you need a t-shirt
You can sleep in the bed with me, at the foot of the bed, with yo feet first
And I will twirk you, unless you in that purple
You the only good smoking, puffing better than purple, gurl
I hope you fertile gurl
So we can have a baby Boi or a baby gurl
To Chuck E. Cheese and Disneywurld
I'm just saying you're a keeper
From the day Big Boi was born, till the day I see the Grim Reaper
I'm keepin' her, Ha ha!

[Hook] x 2
