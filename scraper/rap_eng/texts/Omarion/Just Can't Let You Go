This feels so good

Omarion

In the beginning we were supposed to be temporary
But you put that thang on me
They tryna explain to me
That I should just let it be
'Cause I'm lookin' crazy
But I can't be concerned with that
I'm tryna get it again

[Chorus]
Said I'm not that hard
You pull my card
Girl I'm tryna kick the habit
I'm an addict
I can't let you go
Even though I know
That you're not worth me, and ain't good for me
I just can't let you go

You got a man buy you all up on me
And I know I should let it go
You knockin' at my door
And put the pain (thang?) on me
And you're talkin to your homies
I ain't concerned with that
I'm tryna get it again

[Chorus]
I'm not that hard
You pull my card
Girl I'm tryna kick the habit
I'm an addict
I can't let you go
Even though I know
That you're not worth me, and ain't good for me
I just can't let you go

Let it go
Yeah
Ho!

(Just can't let you go)

Yeah!
Whoo!
Omarion!

[Chorus]
I'm not that hard. (oh yeah!)
You pull my card
Girl I'm tryna kick the habit
I'm an addict. (Just can't stop it baby)
I can't let you go, (yeah)
Even though I know (I know)
That you're not worth me, and ain't good for me
I just can't let you go. (for me, for me, oh baby)

Uh
Just can't let you go...
[breathing]

Ahhhhh!
