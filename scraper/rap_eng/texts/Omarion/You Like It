[Verse 1]
You've been showing me signs
You've been blowing me kisses
You've been tryna be mine
Girl, I'm down if you with it
But you know I got a girl
And I know you got a man
But there's one thing you need to understand
I don't give a damn about how he feels
You shouldn't give a damn about how she feels
Cause you and me know what we've got is real
So we should quit playing and close the deal

[Hook]
Girl, I know that you like it, you like it, you like it
And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it
Girl, I know that you like it, you like it, you like it
And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it
So Imma get what
I want
I ain't worried about nobody but you, girl
Come and get what, you want
Ain't no need to hide it all
Girl, I know that you like it, you like it, you like it
And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it
Girl, I know that you like it, you like it, you like it
And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it

[Bridge]
I like the way you comb your hair
I like those stylish clothes you wear
It's just the little things you do
That show how much you really care

[Verse 2]
My girl, she be playing them games
And you've been dealing with a lame
We both be feeling the same
Fuck what he's saying
Fuck what she's saying
Swerving, switching lanes
Stead on up to the bank
Counting the money we make

[Hook]
Girl, I know that you like it, you like it, you like it
And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it
Girl, I know that you like it, you like it, you like it
And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it
So Imma get what
I want
I ain't worried about nobody but you, girl
Come and get what, you want
Ain't no need to hide it all
Girl, I know that you like it, you like it, you like it
And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it
Girl, I know that you like it, you like it, you like it
And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it

[Bridge]
I like the way you comb your hair
I like those stylish clothes you wear
It's just the little things you do
That show how much you really care

[Verse 3]
I know you've got your someone
And I've got someone
But I can give you more, more
I can't stop thinking about you
Girl, I want you
Tell me am I wrong? Wrong?
Girl, I've been hoping, I've been praying, I've been wishing
That you'll say you love me
And you'll work with this decision
And I know you like
And I like it
Let's not wait no more

[Hook]
So Imma get what
I want
I ain't worried about nobody but you, girl
Come and get what, you want

And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it
Girl, I know that you like it, you like it, you like it
And you know that I like it, I like it, I like it
You know I like it, oh-oh
