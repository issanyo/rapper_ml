Last night I was thinkin' 'bout back in the day
When you and I was so happy together every way
But now, reminiscing
I can see the signs was right in front of my face
So I guess, you was right the fault's mine
Say you loved me, whatever
So completely, whatever
I see you was wrong but guess what, baby
I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you
I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you
Shorty, it was only one mistake
Can you forgive me? No
You and me, we got a special thing
I can't let you go, no
One more time, girl, you know I got chu
You know I'll take care of you
Give you anything, be the man you want me to be
You're everything, you know I love you
Girl, I love you, come on now, girl
Lemme show you, I know I was wrong
Then you shoulda kept a smile on my face
I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you
I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Now I've found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you
Come on, tell me how does it make you feel
To know I don't need your love? I'm happy for you
Come on, tell me how does it make you feel
To know that he hot? You're not
I'm happy for you, I'm telling you, fool
I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you
I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you
I got a smile on my face
Don't trip, didn't take long to get over you
I'm good, ain't got no attitude
Found another on the quick finer than you
And that's the truth, fool, I'm happy for you
