Money over bitches, stick to the script (stick to the script)
Drinks that we sip, so they feed us more liters of Crys'

And this is good as it gets (come on, come on, come on)
We on some down south playa shit, it's a trip (hahaha)
And I'ma get fresh for all my women (yeah)

Puff in the back with my dollar stacked up to the ceilin'
You will see when they show me on "How I'm Living" (on "How I'm Living")
And I'ma take this time to point out
All my mami's and Gucci and the money (money)
And we can chill on some cool shit, yeah (come on, come on, come on)
More money than we know what to do with, for real (ha)

[Chorus: Omarion & Smitty]
Tell me, tell me
If you feeling it right
If you still play, if you still play
Put your hands way up in the sky
With someone like me, oh, oh
Let 'em know you's a playa tonight
Tell me, yeah, yeah
If you feeling it right
If you still play
All my ladies put 'em up in the sky
Let 'em know what's the deal
This is for the playa in you
True playa for real

[Verse 2: Smitty, Chris Brown & Omarion]
Who you kissin'? Who you wanna be huggin'? (Wanna be huggin')
Made something from nothin' out this life of crime (life of crime)
Money is time, so I spend mine hustlin' rhymes (hustlin' rhymes)
With another foot stuck in the grind (stuck in the grind) (haha)
Now lemme ask you this
Have you ever been on private jets with a private chef?
First class eatin' lobster tails
All types of exotic fish, straight shit (ooh)
Don't know your name but excuse me miss
Lemme offer you some wine, pass strike the 9 (just take, just take this)
Light a cigar, fill my cup with the best liquor (yeah, yeah)
Real life is what we are
I ain't ashamed of this, it's all fame (not ashamed of this)
The money just came with this, true game (true game)
I spit to the lamest chick
See my clique so big (why don't you tell me? Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Omarion & Smitty]
Tell me, tell me, baby
If you feeling it right
If you still play, yeah
Put your hands way up in the sky
With someone like me
Let 'em know you's a playa tonight
Tell me, tell me, yeah
If you feeling it right
If you still play
All my ladies put 'em up in the sky
Let 'em know what's the deal
Oh, I said, this is for the playa in you
True playa for real

[Bridge: Chris Brown & Mario]
Come with me, come with me, baby
To the after party, oh, that's where you need to be, you need to be
Ecstasy, ecstasy, oh
We gon' get it started if you come with me, don't you just wanna come with me?

[Verse 3: Smitty, Omarion & Chris Brown]
And all my dogs with me (with me)
In the penthouse, rent out the F50 (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Lovin' this life, keep that wrist all glitter with ice
Show 'em what bein' out the hood is like (ooh, yeah)
And we done done it again
Hit the top of the charts, such a lonely star (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I ain't got this play (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Tell me why these niggas hatin' my game, go figure

[Chorus: Omarion & Smitty]
Tell me
If you feeling it right
If you still play
Put your hands way up in the sky
With someone like me, oh
Let 'em know you's a playa tonight
Tell me, tell me, baby, tell me, tell me
If you feeling it right
If you still play
All my ladies put 'em up in the sky
Let 'em know what's the deal
Oh, I said, this is for the playa in you
True playa for real
