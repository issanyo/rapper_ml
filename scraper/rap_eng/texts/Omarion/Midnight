[VERSE 1]
It started out like any other day but it was any thing but
Something 'bout the way the moon was shining something seemed so different ooh
Got in the car but didn't have no reason swear I was driving but something else was leading me
Lost all track of time (damn) the next thing you won't believe

At 9 o'clock I saw her
By 10 I had her number
11's when I called her
At 12 o'clock it happened I gotta blame

[Chorus]
Midnight
I was caught up it's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
Blame it on midnight
If she found out about it would it be a good excuse
Midnight
It's 12 o'clock tick tock tick the clothes drop she's on top and I don't even wanna stop no
It made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight

[VERSE 2]
I'm still here I know I'm in trouble but I'mma finish what I started
My heart is telling me to leave here but my body's saying stay longer
We going strong while my cell phone blowing up
I know it's wrong but something else was leading me
Lost all track of time (damn) the sex is just to good to leave

At 1 o'clock I'm in it
2 o'clock still in it
And 3 o'clock I'm finished
At 4 o'clock I'm driving home I gotta blame

[Chorus]
Midnight
I was caught up it's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
Blame it on midnight
If she found out about it would it be a good excuse
Midnight
It's 12 o'clock tick tock tick the clothes drop she's on top and I don't even wanna stop no
It made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight

What have you done its 5 a.m ooh
Hooking up with somebody that you don't even know
How you gonna get yourself outta this one
You gotta girl at home
I can blame it on my car breaking down or
I can say that I was working late and didn't know
That you was waiting up I never showed up
Girl I know it's my fault blame it on

[Chorus Repeat 'til end]
Midnight
I was caught up it's like I couldn't help myself if I wanted to
Blame it on midnight
If she found out about it would it be a good excuse
Midnight
It's 12 o'clock tick tock tick the clothes drop she's on top and I don't even wanna stop no
It made me disregard and break my baby's heart
I know I did wrong but I blame it on midnight
