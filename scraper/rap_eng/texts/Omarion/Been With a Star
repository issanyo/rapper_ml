You see me on TV
Different videos
Ive got a new chick every week i know
Don't use that to judge me
Come and get to kno me
Hopefully i can show u just what im all about

(you never know)
What u might be missin'
(gimme a go)
Yes I'll beat your interest
(this is a show)
You won't be dissapointed heres your invatation come on (right now)

[Chorus]
Have you ever been with a star everywhere you go everybody knows ya
Have you ever been with a star
24/7 red carpet
Have you ever been a star
Its obvious to see where you should be, with me have you ever been with a star

I bet you never thought I'd wash my own dishes
Ill take out the trash girl u know im getin
I know ur asumin that it's just a song
Only chasin groupies you couldn't be ma wrong

[Chorus]
There's only so much i can say
To persuade you my way
(oh girl) girl u need to trust in me
Forget about what you heard
Baby ima show you what im all about (baby)

[Chorus]
Have you ever been with a star
Have you ever been with a star
Have you ever been with a star
Its obvious to see..
