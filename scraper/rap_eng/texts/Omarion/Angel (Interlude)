[Intro: Omarion]
Okay, okay
I say, I say
Omarion, Kehlani
Heyyyy

[Hook / Verse: Kehlani]
Every morning there's this tension
Hate to leave the bed cause I miss ya and I
Wish I had another minute
Can't believe how hard you got me trippin' (I)
I watch you while you're sleepin'
Thanking God 'cause you...
...

[Hook? Omarion & Kehlani]
Damn I got a confession
I don't know if I need to go to heaven
Everyday is a blessing
'Til I get to the days I ain't stressing 'cause
I woke up kissing the lips of an angel
(On your lips, between your lips)
I woke up kissing the lips of an angel
I-I-I
