[Chopped & Screwed Intro]
Pretty, pretty ass hoes in my room wearin' lingerie
'Bout to make a scene, puffin' green, sippin' chardonnay
Face down, ass up that's the way we like to uuh
Face down, ass up that's the way we like to fuck

[Verse]
You show me things I ain't heard of (heard of, heard of)
The way you poppin' it is like murder (the way you poppin' it is like murder)
The way you callin' me daddy (daddy, daddy)
You can make anyone happy girl

[Chorus]
Let's get turnt up, have a hell of a night
You can bring your friends (you can bring your friends, friends, friends)
It'll be alright yeah

Baby turn up the lights
Cause we going to paradise
