(Chorus)
If your chick come close to me
She ain't going home when she post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
Ooh all my niggas close to me
And all them other niggas where they post to be
Ooh the hoes go for me
Have your chick send a pic like pose for me
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be

(Verse 1)
Tuesday and the club bout to go up
We poppinâ€™ bottles til we muh fucking throw up
Back then they hate me, Now they all on me
Want a bad boy bitch, call me Mike Lowry
This the type of shit that make a broke nigga bitter
Rich motha fucka, wrist froze like the Winter
Come get her, A nigga like me ain't cuffin these hoes
I got bitches who wanna fuck me in every area code
But I ain't fucking with these thot ass bitches
Swerve on em, man they even get the digits
Better keep your chick where she post to be
Bitch want me Nicki want Ogelvee

(Chorus)
If your chick come close to me
She ain't going home when she post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
I'm getting money like I'm post to be
Ooh all my niggas close to me
And all them other niggas where they post to be
Ooh the hoes go for me
Have your chick send a pic like pose for me
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
That's how it post to be
Everything good like it post to be
