[Verse 1: Omarion]
All these girls in the club
Far away I notice her
She's looking hella good
Approach her, I think I should
I sense some rose over there
Somehow she's over here
Gotta whisper in her ear
Let's leave

[Hook]
Infatuation has got me nice and clear
No information about her, I don't care
Maybe I do, but I just want what I get
I'm just a man, might not get another chance

[Hook]
Seem like we forgot about love
Seem like we forgot about love
Spend so much time in the club
Seem like we forgot about love
Seem like we forgot about love
Seem like we forgot about love
Spend so much time in the club

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Racing, getting home
Now we're all alone
I'm getting in my zone
It's getting sexual
I looked in her eyes
She said let's take it slow
Lets be responsible

[Hook]
