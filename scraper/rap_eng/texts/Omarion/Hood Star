[Intro: Bow Wow & Omarion]
Hey man this what the world've been waiting on dawg
New beginning my nigga
Prince of the rap game you know
Me bow weezie
The ambassador omarion
Dig that homeboy
You niggas ready

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
I squeeze the life out of the game
So call me python
Nigga I transform when they turn them lights on
Mic on ice on yeah gets my shine on
Mr. money ain't a thing
Junior with Omarion

[Verse 2: Omarion]
And I confess that I'm feeling myself
I confess that I'm winning through wealth with money under my belt
So much R&B fever that my show can be shelfed
I'm lost in the flow I can't be helped

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
I got a swag that can't be cloned
Got a Benz and a Bentley and a lac and a jag all chrome
I'm a boss watch your mouth boy (who you think talking to)
The hood love what I do (fuck you think talking to)
Respect what I does

[Hook: Omarion & Bow Wow]
We live the life of a hoodstar
Cause your boy nice with it
Girls line up at the bar (at the bar)
That's cause I'm nice with it
Forget the price get it
They talk it but we live it
They talk it but we love it
The definition of nice
[Repeat]

[Verse 4: Bow Wow]
Look I can't describe how I feel man
It's like everytime I breathe I make a million
Shows we can back them out
Money come in large amounts
Balling till we fall nigga
Yeah that's what I'm talking about

[Verse 5: Omarion]
Screaming like guns started popping in the club
Only thing popping is bottles filling my cup
When we step on stages like the twin towers are blown
Fire in my eyes ice in my veins its on its on

[Verse 6: Bow Wow]
Aye the pimp game is ruthless phantom roofless
Young bow weezie
Defintion of what the truth is
I'm everywhere the money be
Everywhere the honeys be
You looking at the real shit
Other niggas wannabe
Columbus to L.A
You lames know just how we get down
Go to any city and we shutting down your whole town
[Omarion]
We young with it and cocky
[Bow Wow]
Yeah we the problem dynamic duo
But not Batman and Robin

[Verse 7: Omarion]
I got a swag that can't be matched
Got a house in the hills and it looks like a carshow in the back
I'm a boss boy (who you talking to)
The hood love what I do (fuck you think you talking to)

[Hook (Omarion, Bow Wow)]

[Verse 8: Bow Wow]
I'm saying man this what we do
You know what I'm saying
24/7 365
The definition of nice
You know
They talk it but we live it
They talk it but we live it
The definition of nice

[Hook (Omarion, Bow Wow):]
We live the life of a hoodstar
Cause your boy nice with it
Girls line up at the bar at the bar
That's cause I'm nice with it
Forget the price get it
They talk it but we live it
They talk it but we live it
The definition of nice
(nice, nice, nice, nice, nice)
