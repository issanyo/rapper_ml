Omarion Ice Box
Fussin' and fightin', we back at it again
I know that, its my fault, you don't understand no
I got memories, this is crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
Good with ma, good with pop, cool with all my niggasniggas
I should try to decide, wanna let u in, but no
Damn these memories, and its crazy
You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know

Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
There's no excuse, no excuse
But I got this

I got this icebox where my heart used to be but I got this
I got this icebox where my heart used to be said I got this
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold,girl
I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
Why can't I get it right, just can't let it go
I opened up, she let me down, I won't feel that no more
I got memories, this is crazy
She ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
I don't mean to take it out on you baby but I can't help it
Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it
And I, I apologize, for makin' you cry
Look me in my eye and promise you won't do me the same

Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
Its no excuse, no excuse
But I got this

I got this icebox where my heart used to be but I got this
I got this icebox w
