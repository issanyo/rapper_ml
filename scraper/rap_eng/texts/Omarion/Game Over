[Hook : Omarion & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I'm running late but I will stay for it
She wanna blaze, I got the flamethrower
Said she need a baller, I got the plane
She hit the "J" and now it's game over
Baby girl I got everything that you need
I know you feeling good now you hit the weed
Bomb bud, big ass and some Hennessy, it's game over
I got to play, game, I got to play, it's game over

[Verse 1 : Omarion]
Pull up on the lane, out up of the Range Rover
I be switching lanes, in my change over
Niggas better pray, I done catch a case on 'em
Put that on the grave, word to J Hova
Fuck her on a plane, call that bitch a lay over
Who am I to play? I know why you came
All these niggas lame, baby what you say
[?] you ain't gotta pay for it

[Hook : Omarion & BJ The Chicago Kid]
I'm running late but I will stay for it
She wanna blaze, I got the flamethrower
Said she need a baller, I got the plane
She hit the "J" and now it's game over
Baby girl I got everything that you need
I know you feeling good now you hit the weed
Bomb bud, big ass and some Hennessy, it's game over
I got to play, game, I got to play, it's game over

[Outro]
Game oh nah oh, it's game over (Game)
Game, it's game over
Game, it's game over
Game, it's game over
(Even if this song is [?])
Game, it's game over
