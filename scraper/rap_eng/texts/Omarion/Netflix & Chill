And I was goin' in, don't know why you tryna front
Like I don't know how to make you beg for it

[Pre-Hook]
Cause soon as my tongue hit that pussy
You know you be losing your mind babe
The moment that you give it to me
You know you be screamin', it's my name
So don't be playin' with a nigga girl
You know how I am when I get off that liquor girl

So I'm on one tonight (Yeah)

[Hook]
So gone girl, let me know how you feel
Don't want, nonthin' on but ya heels

So do it for the thrill, do it for the thrill (Yeah)

[Verse 2 ]
When she come over and bust it open just for old time sake
What would you do if I told you to come and sit it on my face
(That's how I'm feelin' right now)
Let's make it happen, don't hold back baby
Go and make it nasty, go and make it
Nasty for a nigga cause you know that I'ma give you everything you want without you even asking
