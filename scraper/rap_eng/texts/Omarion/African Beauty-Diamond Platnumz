[Verse 1: Diamond Platnumz]
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Hhhmm Hhhmm Hhm Hhm Yeeh!
Am in love with you
There's nothing that i wouldn’t do
Catch a bullet for you
As long as you want me too
Am in love with you
There's nothing that i wouldn’t do
Catch a grenade for you
As long as you want me too

[Bridge: Diamond Platnumz]
Penzi twalipamba Ngonjera
Huba kama Tanga Segera
Kwa viuno vya baikoko
Kutoka Manzabee
Picha twa zitwanga kisela
Post Insta wanga kuwakera
Baada ya chali kimoko
Cause i just wanna let them know

[Chorus : Diamond Platnumz]
Your my African Beauty

Aah! Your my
African Beauty
Your my
My African Beauty
