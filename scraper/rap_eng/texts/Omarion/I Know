[Verse 1]
With him thinkin about me
Huggin me and kissin me
Say that you're dreamin bout me
So what the hell ya doin wit me?
On the phone, tellin me what he does wrong
Can't keep singin that same song
Girl, it's obvious that you need to be with me

[Hook]
Baby, I know that you want me
Know that you need me
Can't live without me
But babe, you got a man
And I know that you pretend that you're in love with him
But, he can't put it down like me
That's why I know that you want me
Know that you need me
Can't live without me
I know it's hard on you
But you try to pretend that you're in love with him
But I know that you really want me, girl

[Verse 2]
Said ya at home all alone while he's gone
Tryna act like what he doin ain't wrong
If your heart says follow him, then do it
Baby girl, I'm just tryna help you through it
4 months at a time, you don't see him
Wishin that I switch places with him
I'm not gon' pressure the issue
Just let it be
And if you're meant to be with me, we'll have to see

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Baby girl if you're really feelin me
Here is where you need to really be (girl we can't play these games)
And if you feel me say oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And if you feel me say oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, whoa

[Hook]

[Breakdown]
No, no, shit, I know that you pretend the
Whooop! Said I know that you really want me girl
Whooop! Whooop! Uh, yeah Uh, yeah
I like this right here
I know that you pretend that
Whooop! Yeah, uh

[Hook]
