[Intro: Rick Ross]
Streetmix, Omarion
And a few rich niggas, you hear me?

[Hook 1: Omarion]
Fuck her I don't care
Done looking for love, cause she took away her
Ah, fuck her I don't care
Done looking for love, cause she took away

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm screamin' "fuck it I don't care"
All my bad bitches gotta share
Cartier things come in pairs
Twos, menage, make love after massage
Hoes kept findin' my garage, tadow
Wouldn't send flowers but I kept her on allowance
She'd check the ATM, say I kept it one thousand
Wow, in the black Range Rover her heels get scuffed in shoot outs
She my soldier
(Pour one up) My sneakers Balenciaga
(Pour one up) I'm drivin' the Murcielago
(Pour one up) I'm smokin' that caviar
(Pour one up) She lookin Italiano, my homies stick to the code
Never been a lame
Sixteen in the Birkin, no she never been the same
No she never been the same
Double M baby hottest niggas in the game

[Hook 2: Omarion]
Now I'm M.I.A. (M.I.A.) , M.I.A. (M.I.A.)
On love, on love - M.I.A
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
And now we're spendin' money like, like fuck it, I don't care
Go ahead and get another pair
Young nigga get it so I got enough to share
I even went and spent fifteen hundred on her hair
Before she went M.I.A. no paper planes
Swishers twistin' when she used to roll a nigga Mary Jane
Lately I've been on her brain
She hope I don't go and get infected by the fame
If she heard Electric Highway, she know I stayed the same
And recently I been tryin' contain the freak in me
Show her I got decensy
Be everything she needs to be
But she be trippin' and these hoes be everywhere
And everytime these bitches there
Man it's fuck her I don't, fuck her I don't care
Yeah

[Hook 1]

[Verse 3: French Montana]
Shorty said she leavin' me, I already left nigga
Go on kick that bullshit to the next nigga
She must be gettin' high with DMX nigga
Don't make me bomb on your ass like Flex nigga
Hundred thou outfit gettin' dressed nigga
Mind on my money, full court press nigga
I'm in the club with your BFF
Heard about them Coke Boyz new BMF
My chickens never leave the nest
And shit just went away, what's with the PMS
Shorty said she ain't a jump-off
Now I call that bitch Hulk Hogan, she rip her clothes off
Me and Rozay on the yacht smokin'
With your main bitch with her twat soakin'
Watch a young nigga peel that Rose off
This relationship nastier than coleslaw

[Hook 2]

[Bridge: Omarion]
Since you've been away
Love's been M.I.A. (M.I.A.), M.I.A. (M.I.A.)
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love

[Hook 2]

[Outro: Omarion]
Done looking for love, cause the took away her love
Fuck her I don't care
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love
