[Intro: Twinnzel Washington]
I just want to know can we have a good time?
Keep it on the low if we have a good time
I just want to know can we have a good time?
A good, good time
I just want to know can we have a good time?
Keep it on the low when we have a good time
I just want to know can we have a good time?
A good, good time

[Bridge: Twinnzel Washington]
Where you can forget the things that you know
Take this drink and you can sip slow
Ain't too many sexy like you
And you know how many women I know
And don't take too long cause I got to go
Just write me when you miss me
Then I'll get you and we'll go

[Hook: Twinnzel Washington]
Go
Ridin' (Ridin')
Ridin' (Ridin')
Go (Go)
Ridin' (Ridin')
Ridin' (Ridin')
Go (Go)

[Bridge: Omarion]
Tell me what's your name
(Tell me) Tell me what's your sign
Tell me what you into
(Tell me) Tell me what you like
If you was rich tomorrow tell me what would you do with it
And if you can see the future baby do you see me in it?

[Verse 2: Dee Day]
Her ambition’s attractive
Her vicky’s on and they matching
You roll with me from the bottom, bae
Now we’re top floor like attics
I fiend for it like addicts
Have you updating your status
On facebook, up late nights; talking about you’re think about marriage
Yeah I got the, a fact
Its more than smoking and sex
My heart is involved, he heart is involved, we’re taking it slow on what we do next
And baby I know
And maybe you know, that we can be close
Take this approach, I’m right by your side
You need me the most
And just for tonight, she’s taking it off
And dropping it low
I’m taking my time, enjoying it all
And taking it slow
Whoa

[Bridge: Omarion]
Tell me what's your name
(Tell me) Tell me what's your sign
Tell me what you into
(Tell me) Tell me what you like
If you was rich tomorrow tell me what would you do with it
And if you can see the future baby do you see me in it?

[Twinnzel Washington]
Where- Where- Where-
Where you can forget the things that you know
Take this drink and you can sip slow
Ain't too many sexy like you
And you know how many women I know
And don't take too long cause I got to go
Just write me when you miss me
Then I'll get you and we'll go
