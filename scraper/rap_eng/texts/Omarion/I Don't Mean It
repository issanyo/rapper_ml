[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
This gon' be your favorite song

[Verse 1: Maquambe]
She the baddest in the club (Baddest in the club)
I'm lying cause I'm drunk
But I'm still young (Young)
And I'm just tryna get some
Bured balls, black purse I'm not thirsty, I'm prosistant
Chillin', doing reps, [?]
Doing these sets and then I won't remember
I don't mean it, I've been drinking (I've been drinking)
One hand on my dookah, one hand on the daub
Getting money, never stoned weed
Needed more, that's why she burned free
Spend a few, blew a hundred
That's why I gotta wash my [?]

[Hook: Omarion]
Don't mean to be rude, in this club (this club)
Got a drink all up in my cup
And might kiss, and might touch, might see things I can be in love
I don't mean it, I'm drunk
I don't mean it, I'm drunk
I don't mean it, I'm drunk
Too fucked up to sit with one girl

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Yeaah
Throwing Henny in my club, rolling up 'til I'm leaning
So if I tell you I'm in love in the club, I don't mean it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't mean it, ay

[Verse 2: Omarion]
I just wanna set the record straight
And fuck around, now I hesitate
I got a deal from one every day
Oh, you know I'm colder then the everglades
Other girls don't know Omarion
And then pop champagne, all the time
And we going, get it going for the night
I'm on for the night, yeah let's go for a ride

[Verse 3: Maquambe]
Seeing you girl, no I'm busy
Dope vision, can't see straight
Living like a dolphin
On this D and you let me see you [?]
You're always what you wear
Black bottles with the flare
Throwing money everywhere
Nice style, we up in here

[Hook: Omarion]
Don't mean to be rude, in this club (this club)
Got a drink all up in my cup
And might kiss, and might touch, might see things I can be in love
I don't mean it, I'm drunk
I don't mean it, I'm drunk
I don't mean it, I'm drunk
Too fucked up to sit with one girl

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Yeaah
Throwing Henny in my club, rolling up 'til I'm leaning
So if I tell you I'm in love in the club, I don't mean it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't mean it

[Hook: Omarion]
Don't mean to be rude, in this club (this club)
Got a drink all up in my cup
And might kiss, and might touch, might see things I can be in love
I don't mean it, I'm drunk
I don't mean it, I'm drunk
I don't mean it, I'm drunk
Too fucked up to sit with one girl
