If you wanna fight

That may be a body guard tonight

I'm ready for war it's one for all

I'll be your army

If you wanna win

There is no way i will give e in

Let if the war it's one for all

I'll be your army

I'll be your, I'll be your I'll be your

I'll be your

I I I'll be yours, I I I'll be yours, I I I'll be yours

I I I'll be yours, I I I'll be yours, I I I'll be yours

There we are in the dark wondering who we are

Givin love and givin up

Discovering what's in our eyes

Don't push too far

No don't run away

â€˜cause i'll give my height

But you gotta get me something baby

If you wanna fight

That may be a body guard tonight

I'm ready for war it's one for all

I'll be your army

If you wanna win

There is no way i will give e in

Let if the war it's one for all

I'll be your army

I'll be your, I'll be your I'll be your

I'll be your

I I I'll be yours

I I I'll be yours, I I I'll be yours

I I I'll be yours

I I I'll be yours, I I I'll be yours

I I I'll be yours

I I I'll be yours, I I I'll be yours
