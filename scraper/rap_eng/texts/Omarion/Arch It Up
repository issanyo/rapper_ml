[Trae Tha Truth:]
Baby threes nothing saying but stay major
Lace off ain't nobody trying to come save ya
Trying to run up in ya like it was game time
Got a few in the body and can't fade ya
Say you man got a lock but I'm a pass him
I'm the king of the streets you better ask him
I hear you riding stick when you in front of the rari
I ain't worried about it I'm bout it I'm bout to crash him
I know that fly shit cool but I'm a thug for days
Old school with the swag franky beverly mase
I know the streets ain't safe but you can tell him it pays
Wardrobe high-class trying to get him a raise
I've been in it a minute but I ain't ready to stop
I ain't nothing like haters rather see you on top
Haters get off your clothes rather open up shop
I ain't worried bout time stone froze up the watch
I don't say shit boy I shoot shots
Headboard knock you can hear it up the block
In a minute I'll have it going down like Joc
Ain't nothing here fake you can tell how I rock
Bout that life tell him stop that pose
My grill is platinum baby then yours gold
See the truth is hot but everything else cold
I'm what's not everything your soul

If you was rich tomorrow, tell me what would you do with it
And if you could see the future baby would you see me in it
Would you date me for a minute
Girl before you let me hit it
Are you single are you taken
Working towards your education
I'm just asking I'm just saying
What's your current situation
Cause I see you across the room and you the baddest in the building
What's up
