[Verse 1:Omarion]
From the moment you came in
You knew I been watching
Been picturing you out of
Them clothes that you wearing
You're naked
Girl can you blame me?
When your hair long and your ass fat
And you know how much I like that
Heels high and that dress tight
And I'm wondering why you wore that
To tease me
Can't be no other reason
And there's so many girls in here tonight
So many girls in here that's so so fine
But shawty I can't lie
