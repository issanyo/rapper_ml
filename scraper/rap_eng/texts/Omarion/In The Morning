Baby you summertime fine, I let you get on top, I be the underline
I'm trying to get beside you like the number 9, dime
You fine as hell, I guess I met you for a reason, only time can tell
But well, I'm wondering what type of shit you wantin'
Do you like the finer things or you a simple woman
Would you drink with a nigga, do you smoke weed
Don't be ashamed, it ain't no thing, I used to blow trees
Gettin lifted, I quit but shit, I might get high with you
Its only fitting cause I'm looking super fly with you
A flower, you are powerful, you do something to me
Cause girl I caught the vibe like you threw something to me
So i threw em back, now all my niggas hollerin, who was that
Oh boy, she bad nigga, what you bout do with that
I'm finna take you home, just sip a little patron
Now we zonin', baby you so fine

Can I hit it in the morning?

Sun risin’ while you yawning
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?

[Fabolous]
Shawty you Autumn-time cool
But they don't see your beauty, fuck all them blind fools
Body so mean that it's borderline cruel
Work 8 to 3, then from 4 to 9 school
Dominican girl who knows more than Mangu
She say lets stay in the room and order Dom Cruz
It sounds like a plan
Cause girl once I got you by your limbs
That guy who spot you at the gym can't put it down like I can
I wanna take you places further than where your feet walk
Why scream when your voice is better for sweet talk
A little accent, cute ass lisp
First a toast is said then a flute glass kiss
I like it when you whip yo hair, but thats Willow fault
I speak body language, fuck pillow talk
We can wake up ’round noon on a Saturday
And make a fuckin movie, now thats a matinee
But on the weekdays I wanna be yo’ wake up call

Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Sun risin’ while you yawning
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?

Uh, baby you winter time cold
The night is still young, drink that dinner wine slow
I'm trying to make the goose bumps on your inner thigh show
I'll let you beat me there as far as finish lines go
Yeah, and if you gotta leave for work
I'll be right here in the same bed that you left me in
I love thick women cause my aunt, she rode equestrian
I used to go to the stables and get those kids to bet me
And I would always ride the stallions whenever she let me
I'm joking, I mean that thing is poking
I mean you kinda like that girl that's in the US Open
I mean I got this hidden agenda that you provoking
I got bath water that you can soak in
Things I could do with lotion
Dont need a towel, we could dry off in the covers
And when you think you like it, I promise you gon' love it
Yeah, when lights coming through the drapes and we both yawning
I roll over and ask if..

Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Sun risin’ while you yawning
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?

You left me stranded in the morning
It was so moving
So
Something so precious  with the lips like a soft pillow
Straight to the touch
You kept me hustling all night , oh
It was something the wettest that I ever really flowed into
It was oozing ziggling don't be giggling
So hard on it you don't want to really want to damage
The package that came with the short time paradise
That lasted for something more then they really
Want to be calling the medicament
I gave you something right you
You want just like the maid
That all that matters
But I don't really want to speak on that now do we
And I hit like these when I did it in the morning

Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Sun risin’ while you yawning
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?
Shawty, can I hit it in the morning?

Can I heat it while its storming, storming
While the weathers transforming, transforming
Can I heat it in the morning, morning
Can I heat it in the morning, morning
While the weathers transforming, transforming
Can I heat it while its storming, storming

Baby this your morning
Go ahead and own it
Be the landlord
Property owner
All exclamations
Its how it happened
My Aston Martin
The sex was trapped in
I didn't get a chance to take her to dinner
I saw the front ? shes no beginner
Even in her 2 seater I had to pin her
Then got on the fly
Do you remember
Cause I do I do
Will there be a round 2
Question mark
Damn I should have missed my flight my flight
He would only be right on right in
To cook you breakfast bacon eggs and toast
Dont forget the ring

Can I heat it while its storming, storming
While the weathers transforming-forming
Can I heat it in the morning, morning
Can I
Can I heat it in the morning, morning
While the weathers transforming-forming
Can I heat it while its storming, storming
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
Can I hit it in the morning?
