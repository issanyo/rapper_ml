[Verse 1]
I’ll be long gone by the time you read this
I’ll be long gone by the time you read this
What am I here for
What am I here for
I’ll be long gone by the time you read this
I’ll be long gone by the time you read this
What am I here for
What am I here for

[Chorus]
You’re all I need
You’re all I need
You’re all I need
And all I needed was you

[Verse 2]
I love you so much, but you just can’t see it
I love you so much, but you just can’t see it
What are you here for
What are you here for

[Bridge]
When time passes
When time passes
I hope you see
I hope you see
I hope you see
I hope you see

[Chorus]
You’re all I need
You’re all I need
You’re all I need
And all I needed was you
You’re all I need
You’re all I need
You’re all I need
And all I needed was you

[Post-Chorus]
Girl I’m gone
How do you feel
How do you feel
How does it feel

[Outro]
I want a bad girl tonight
Mischievous and clever
Caught up in my fame
Trying to capitalize on our time together
Acting like she bigger than she is
Looking seductive
Wanting me to sweat her
Playing hard to get know damn well she gon' get in here
And do whatever I tell her
