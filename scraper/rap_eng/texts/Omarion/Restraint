Try to prevent this but i see you everyday
This crush is fckin stupid make me act a certain way (way yeah yeah)
We won’t work as lovers
You more like my brother
Keep these feelings undercover (cover)

Well we got it comin
Period, point, blank, comma
I’m more like bring bottles
And you be poppin bottles with these models
I know it sounds cocky but
I’m gonna get over it

Try to convince myself it’s not that easy
I'm not the girl who really acts as needy
S’not out for discussion
True i wanna touch it
But I don’t even trust this n*gga (woah)

(CHORUS)
I can’t describe
What’s this s’pose to mean?
What’s this s’pose to mean?
We can’t define
What these feelings mean
What these feelings mean
What do they mean? What do they mean? (x7)

Well you look like a doll
We’re supposed to be friendly
Why you walk like a doll
Everything is so temptin’

Had had had to stop and now go
You fckin up my flow
Wanna be in control
But that ain’t gonna happen
You you you you say this
As so foolish foolish foolish
But you be actin’ clueless clueless clueless clueless
Im a shenanigan but this sure mo-mo-mo-move me move me
While I’m dividing you
I’m multiplying inside
(??, i don’t give a fck)

You say I’m like your brother
But we must be kissin’ cousin
Well i dont give a fck
Somehow i end up
Butt naked and bruised
I ain’t gotta lie that’s the truth coz

(CHORUS)
I can’t describe
What’s this s’pose to mean
What’s this s’pose to be
We can’t define
What these feelings mean
What these feelings mean
What do they mean? What do they mean? (x7)
