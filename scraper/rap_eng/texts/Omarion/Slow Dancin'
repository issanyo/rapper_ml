[Verse 1:]
I, see you across the room
I had to come get at you
You want it
Model Chick
Ooo you done true so I
Stepped to the DJ quick
I told him to drop that I'm Mr. Biggs
Just give me the chance
To put my hands
On you

[Pre-Hook]
Made the DJ slow it down
So I can put my arms around you
Had to get you next to me
Girl we about to be, doing our thing

[Chorus:]
Slow dancing
Bumping and grinding and maybe (maybe)
Romancing
So into you
Not, trancin’
Hands on your waist
We face to face
Slow dancing
Bumping and grinding and maybe
Romancing
I’m all in your ear
And I’m whispering (oh!)
I’m feeling this
Cause we chilling baby

[Verse 2:]
Now that I got you right here
I’m feeling you girl it’s clear
You know what I mean
I’m thinking bout what’s in them jeans
I ain't tryna let you go
Don’t want it to end oh no
Fienin for you for sure
So tell him to drop one more

[Pre-Hook]

[Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
I, want this to go on all night
Ooo baby it feels so right
Me up on you
Holding you tight (yeah)
So nice
Baby don’t you go no where
Keep it right there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: 3x]

[Outro]
This is my song for real no doubt
And the DJ making me feel thugged out
As I walked onto the dance floor
Baby get your dance on
Put your arms around me
Cause I’m feeling on your booty
