All on your body. It's like power
Giving you energy to work

Getting that raise that you deserve
Cause understand it baby

Hard to stay dry with 10,000

Hard to stay dry with 10,000

Girl, you got my permission to take off from work
Tomorrow I’ll commission you
Baby you are the work
I vouch you’re a magician
And you got me trickin'
So much money on the floor
Ready to go
Don’t matter what your rent is

You got me tricking
So much money on the floor
I'm ready to go
It don't matter what your rate is

Girl, you got my permission to take off the work tomorrow
I'll commission you
Baby you such a flirt
You know you're a magician
You got me kissing
You know what I want
I'm ready to go
It don't matter what your shift to go to work

Getting that
Getting that raise that you deserve
Cause understand it baby

All I wanna get you in the shower in the water
I'm gonna stay dry with 10000
All on your body
You're so ambitious baby
