[Verse 1:]
Second you caught my eye
Girl I couldn’t deny, that you got me on fire, baby
Something ‘bout the way you walk
I just can’t get enough, girl you got that good stuff
I think I’m losing my mind. Girl can we just talk, baby?
In case you haven’t noticed, your body’s got me focused
Just wanna let you know, “My name’s Omarion!” Oh…

[Chorus:]
It’s nice to meet ya, baby girl you’re a keepa
And I’m never gonna let you go, said I’m never gonna let you go
‘cause you’re a keepa. You’re something special
Feeling you since I met you, and I’m never gonna let you go
Said I’m never gonna let you go, ‘cause you’re a keepa

[Verse 2:]
Girl, it’s official. Really, really wanna get with you
Girl, like no other, girl that’s in here tonight
Let’s go somewhere quiet, get to know each other more private
Whatever it is about ya, just feels so right, baby
I like your conversation, just wanna take my time
And come over ‘round you girl. I gotta have you in my world
“Come here, baby!”

[Chorus:]
It’s nice to meet ya, baby girl you’re a keepa
And I’m never gonna let you go, said I’m never gonna let you go
‘cause you’re a keepa. You’re something special, feeling you since
I met you, and I’m never gonna let you go, said I’m never gonna let you go
‘cause you’re a keepa
“You’re a keepa, baby!”…Yeah! …Oh!

[Hook:]
Girl, I just can’t get enough, girl I just can’t get enough
‘cause you’re a keepa. Girl, you got me burnin’ up, and I just can’t get enough
‘cause you’re a keepa. Girl, I just can’t get enough, girl I just can’t get enough
‘cause you’re a keepa. Girl, you got me burnin’ up, you got me burnin’ up, ‘cause you’re a keepa
[Big Boi Rap]
The horns are making me horny. Sugar, darlin’
I adore thee. These other girls are boring; really don’t got nothing for me
Freaky in the worst way, me and Rick James got the same birthday
Simply means I’ll grill you from Thursday to Thursday. 7 days, 1 week, 168 hours
I got the power, to make you shout, but I’ll knock yo’ ass sour
Scream, scream, permanent on the team, like a Bantu, or a duke
Or a Just For Me! No lie, relax, lay down, you need a t-shirt
You can sleep in the bed with me, at the foot of the bed, with your feet first
And, I will twirk you, you the only good smoking
Puffing better than purple, girl. I hope you fertile, girl
So we can have a baby boy or a baby girl. To Chuck E
Cheese and Disneyworld. I’m just saying you’re a keepa
From the day Big Boi was born, till the day I see the grim reaper
I’m keepin’ her. (Ha ha)

[Chorus (out)]
