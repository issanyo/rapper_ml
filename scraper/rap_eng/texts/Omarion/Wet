[Intro]
Can I lick your body down?
Do you like it like this?
Can I push it right there? Hey!
Can I lick your body down?
Can I push it right there?
Do you like it like this? Yeah!

[Verse 1]
I'm gon' take my time
You should know that before we start
I hope that you're ready girl
Cause it's time for you to get punished
Inside of this bed
Oh I'm goin' crazy messin' up your hair, oh no

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby you turn me on, baby you turn me on, baby you turn me on
Baby you turn me on, baby you turn me on, baby you turn me on
I wanna knock it out, I wanna knock it out, I wanna knock it out

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm gon' make you see that you gon' want me back
Girl you won't forget
Whip cream, baby oil, spank you cause you spoiled
I'm gon' get you wet
Candles is all burnt up, I'mma have you turnt up
Imma make you wet
Imma make you wet, wet, wet, wet
I'm gon' make you wet
Wet, Wet oh, wet yeah!

[Interlude]
You know, imma just let the music ride
While we doin' what we do

Can you feel me? Can you feel it?
Is it heavy? Do you feel it? Is it heavy?
Do you feel it? Can you feel me?
Do hear me, do you feel it?

Feel it?

You gon' want me back
Whip cream, baby oil, spank you cause you spoiled
Wet, wet, oh, wet yeah!

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm gon' make you see that you gon' want me back
