[Intro: Omarion]
Damn
I can't believe this is happening to me
But I guess sh*t happens, right?

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Damn, so this is how it's goin' down
Me and you ain't talkin' now
What about everything we've been through
You just gon' throw all this out
What about the good times we done had
All the times that I made ya laugh
What about the times when I cheered ya up
When you was hurt, and you was sad, yeah

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Seems like yesterday you were my woman
Shoppin' malls and holidays couldn't tell us nothin'
Now you all up in my house with another brother
And I'm thinking to myself I'm about to kill this mother...
And I said, "Girl I'm sorry"
Even though I know it's late for apologies
Babe, how could you do this to me
You were supposed to have my baby

[Hook: Omarion]
I'm tryna act like I don't wanna be with you
Like I would be okay
If you just walked away
I'm tryna act like I don't wanna see you
Like you were just a phase
I'll forget you in a couple of days
Tryna act like I can do without feeling on your booty
Find another ghetto cutie
(To) Do me like you do me baby, yeah
Girl I'm just so addicted to you
I'mma try but I can't
Cause you're all I'm tryna do

[Verse 3: Omarion]
I see ya here and there with your friends and I start that frontin'
Act like I been doing my thing and I don't need your loving
But I see it in your eyes girl you want me back
And I'll give anything just to have you back
Can't believe, that you got, with my homey
I don't know, what to do, you confuse me
Girl this is crazy, you're supposed to have my baby

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Bow Wow]
Yeah, I've done a lotta things wrong
But I guess that's something I gotta live with
If I could then I would turn back the hands of time
Girl I woulda re-did this
I guess that saying is true
"You don't know what you got until it's gone,"
Now I'm sittin' here all alone
Wishin that she'll come back home
But she ain't comin back
Homey ain't no cure for that
A woman can take so much and once it get that point
She gone like that
I'm tryna be the best I can
I'm tryna be a better man
I'm trying all that I can girl
I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying girl

[Hook]
