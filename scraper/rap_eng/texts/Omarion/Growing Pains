[Verse 1]
I can’t live with you, but I can’t live with out ya
Not breathing with you, but hard to breathe without ya
Think to myself everyday
How they split us apart, four different men that shared the same heart
It had to happen this way
Us go our separate way
Would be lying if I said I didn’t miss col-fax days
Sit and think to myself how this thing has changed my life
Damn we was suppose to be boys for life

[Chorus]
This is my growing pains
Caused by the fortune and fame
Thought we’d be together forever and ever and ever
Never thought that we’d go our separate ways
Now look how things have changed
Looks like there never ever be the same
So hard to explain what went wrong?
After we were together for too long
Now, never be the same again
Tell me how this thing happened
Damn, this is my growing pains

[Verse 2]
Some people don’t know
That I tried it again
Even though I was sour (sour)
I tried to be a man (man)
I couldn’t hold a grudge, knowing in my heart I still had love
But If ya’ll knew what went down you’d be like what the fuck
They say you don’t know what you got until it’s gone
Loyalty, honesty, where did we go wrong?
I guess it was God's plan for me to be alone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
How could this ever be, them no longer apart of me?
What did you do to turn them other boys against me?
I just have one thing to say
What you do comes back your way

[Interlude:]
So many things were said, so many false statements about me against my manager Chris
Sometimes I just feel like giving up
Like I was nothing
Like I couldn’t go on with out them
But know I feel like God is looking down on me and he shall carry my soul
As I take this solo journey
I never meant for none of this to happen
I’m sorry, but I have no regrets

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Damn, this is my growing pains
