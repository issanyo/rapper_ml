[Verse 1: Omarion]
Falling
I thought you was everything I needed
Everything I wanted
Thought I found love, true love
Baby, girl you have my heart
I knew it from the start

[Hook:Omarion]
Cause it feels like love
Swear I didn't feel like running tonight
But I thought we made love
Suddenly woke up, feels like
Swear I saw you in my bed I know that perfume
Girl you messing with my head I be all confused
Tell me what's the difference between love and other drugs
Because in the end it all comes crashing down
Tell me what's the difference between love and other drugs
Baby girl you're just as dangerous
You keep me falling, keep me falling
Like I'm free falling, got me feeling like I'm falling
(Keep me falling)

[Verse 2: Omarion]
High off love, feeling like I'm crashing
Into that ocean
Baby you got me surfing
And I can do it
You're the only one for me
Don't you leave me lonely
Baby I never do you that way

[Hook:Omarion]
Cause it feels like love
Swear I didn't feel like running tonight
But I thought we made love
Suddenly woke up, feels like
Swear I saw you in my bed I know that perfume
Girl you messing with my head I be all confused
Tell me what's the difference between love and other drugs
Because in the end it all comes crashing down
Tell me what's the difference between love and other drugs
Baby girl you're just as dangerous
You keep me falling, keep me falling
Like I'm free falling, got me feeling like I'm falling
(Keep me falling)
