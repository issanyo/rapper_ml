[Verse 1]
Cannot believe I got her all alone
Cannot believe the timing when this song came on
Oh, know how I feel but don't know what to say (On the low)
Turn this up and let it play
Already played a few about nothing
Then 1 or 2 about fucking
Then I played a couple I made  for you, on the low
Girl but I didn't say it was you
All along while you were on the phone on your way
Already getting played, girl you don't have to say shit


[Pre - Chorus]
Girl you know why I played this
Girl this is the sex playlist

[Chrorus]
Girl you, Girl you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou. You know

[Verse 2]
When I lay my head on your lap, I'm never tired
Don't get me started by the way that you roll
You keep me higher
And I'm serious, girl you know you don't have to play
Not if I got the play, girl you don't have to say shit


[Pre - Chorus]
Girl you know why I played this
Girl this is the sex playlist

[Chrorus]
Girl you, Girl you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou. You know
Girl you, Girl you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou. You know
Girl you, Girl you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou. You know
Girl you, Girl you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou. You know
Girl you, Girl you-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou. You know
