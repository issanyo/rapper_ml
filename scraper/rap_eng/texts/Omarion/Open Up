[Intro]
Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up, open up

Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up, open up (Touch, Touch)

[Verse 1]
Reach out and touch, touch, (touch)
Reach out and touch, touch, touch
You lookin’ yummy, yummy, yummy
Wet like tsunami, nami, nami
Girl I won't rush it, rush it, rush it
I wanna plug in, plug in, lemme plug in
You lookin' gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
Just might reach out and touch, oh

Oh (woah)
Late to my show (woah)
You already know (know)
Hotter when it's colder (It's colder)
Let me see you gettin' gold
Oh, woah ,oh woah, oh woah
It's colder

Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up, open up

Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up, open up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll take my time with you
Won't waste my time with you
I'm on my vibe with you
Sit back recline with you

[Chorus]
I’ll never say no
I’ll never say no
No compromising
With your permission, I’m gonna touch you

[Verse 2]
Came up on a couple commas
Full whip, no Hondas
Prolly take a group to Collins (Su Collins)
I’m one in a million
Pulled up to my Lil Yachty
Bout go full Monty
Asap I’m rocking, it’s high levels yeah yeah
Girl you know when to flex
I don't mean disrespect
Threesome in the mornin'
You ain’t gotta be gone yet
All you gotta do is call me

Open up with just one touch

Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up, open up

Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up with just one touch
Open up, open up

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll take my time with you
Won't waste my time with you
I'm on my vibe with you
Sit back recline with you

[Chorus]
I'll never say no (I'll never say no)
I'll never say no (I'll never say no)
No compromising (No compromise)
