She can run with you
Lay with you
But I'm gonna stay with you
And I'm gonna leave with you

She can run with you
Lay with you
But I'm gonna stay with you
And I'm gonna leave with you

So it's probably wise that
You don't cross the line
Fuck your glass of wine
It's like I've never let 'em ride back
Torn apart, catch me
I'm on the run right back

Baby I, I love your steam
Risin' off your body like a dream
Wait could you tell me
If that's really where you wanna be?
It's whatever, it's whatever
It's whatever

Do you see what I see?
A girl that's more than lonely
Cold feels so lonely
But it brings you close to me
It's whatever, it's whatever

Do you see what I see?
A girl that's more than lonely
Cold feels so lonely
But it brings you close to me
It's whatever, it's whatever
It's whatever

Do you see what I see?
