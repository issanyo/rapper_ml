Face off, face off
Keep popping at the mob
I’ll knock your face off
Face off, yeah I’ll knock your face off
Keep popping at the mob
And we gonn face off
This ain’t what you want, this ain’t what you want
I said this ain’t what you want, this ain’t what you want
This ain’t what you want, this ain’t what you want
Old lame ass nigga, old pussy ass nigga
You popping guns, I ain’t with it
You talking shit, I don’t wanna hear it
You can tell a nigga violent, when you see his face
Fuck probation, erybody bout to catch a case
Ok, I don’t told it, but my folks got it
And I told them, let this noggin if he out of pocket
Get on any nigga grill like I’m …forms
Earthquake blows, bitch no warning
Call security, niggas tryna get at me
Wiling total, bottles busting heads, in the vip
Fucking being a celebrity, that’s the way it gotta be
Supercharged …man these niggas shouldn’t have started me
A pencil to these niggas, I erase them
Any hoes ain’t no better, I replace them
Another man is one thang that I can’t fear
If he come near, then he outta here
Face off, face off
Keep popping at the mob
I’ll knock your face off
Face off, yeah I’ll knock your face off
Keep popping at the mob
And we gonn face off
This ain’t what you want, this ain’t what you want
I said this ain’t what you want, this ain’t what you want
This ain’t what you want, this ain’t what you want
Old lame ass nigga, old pussy ass nigga
I’m stressed to the point, I could kill a nigga
And fuck a bottle wanted bitch, I’m on some hard liquor
And niggas saying, but they don’t understand
If you was me, you would be quick to pop a rubber band
Man these niggas over, bitch I’m ..
Knock your face off, now you need a make up
The game’s over, and the way too
It’s got push back not they gotta stay for you
Warrup new, what that ankle do
Act a motherfucking monkey when they let you loose
Wharrup Dick, I’ma hold it down
Ain’t no circumcised chip but we gonna let the clown
Don’t play with me peso, tell chichi get the yayo
I’m fin to get the …
Niggas kill me with that mugging shit
Then you run up on the nigga, the mugging don’t exist
Face off, face off
Keep popping at the mob
I’ll knock your face off
Face off, yeah I’ll knock your face off
Keep popping at the mob
And we gonn face off
This ain’t what you want, this ain’t what you want
I said this ain’t what you want, this ain’t what you want
This ain’t what you want, this ain’t what you want
Old lame ass nigga, old pussy ass nigga
