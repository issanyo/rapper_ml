[Chorus:]
If you fall up in the club
And them niggas want to mug
When you step up to they face
What they gon' do (Shit!)

If you fall up in the club
And them hoes start acting up
When you step up to them hoes
What they gon' do (Shit!)

What they gon' do (Shit!) [Repeats]

[Repeat: x2]
Pussy nigga what's up
Hell naw you ani't gon' buck
All that poppin' at the mouth
Gon' get you fucked up

[Repeat: x2]
You done came in the club
With your motherfucking click
We don't give a fuck hoe
Ya'll pussy like bitches

It's some Eastside niggas and they deep in this bitch
And they step to any nigga that be talkin' that shit
It's some Westside niggas and the deep in this bitch
And they step to any nigga that be talkin' that shit
It's some Northtside niggas and the deep in this bitch
And they step to any nigga that be talkin' that shit
It's some Southtside niggas and the deep in this bitch
And they step to any nigga that be talkin' that shit

[Chorus]
My brain is taking in too much pain
I'm bout to explode first, and then take names
But it's cool lil' shorty don't be so alarmed
I learned to buck nigga when I jabbed in the arm
I don't play wit motherfuckers 'cause the shit be real
Make you hold your breath longer than the Navy Seal
And them bows gon' leave you ass dead in the past
Ain't no way you can differ your dick from your ass

I drop bows wit my nigga fuck hoes wit my nigga
How the fuck you think I feel about this arm in your figure
It's a closed casket for them hating bastards
It's some G's that's real, it's a mess of faggots
Who you talkin' to bitch, what you gon' do trick
When it's obvious to see that you ain' t do shit
Lil Scrappy the prince and I ain't takin' no junk
I'm a quiet crunk nigga and fuck being a punk

[Chorus]
I'm walkin' round this motherfucking club
(What!)
Them niggas still looking over here and shit
(Lookin over here talking and shit!)
Think we gon' have to get some motherfucking straightening going on this motherfucker (Yeah!)
This what we gon motherfucking do
(What's up!)
We gon walk over to these motherfucking niggas
(Yeah!)
Talk to their ass like this (Like this)

Only bitches talk shit
Only bitches talk shit
Only bitches talk shit
That's why we bustin' your shit [Repeat: x2]

[Chorus:]
