The Game - Southside Lyrics

Yall dont want it with the southside

(ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

Yall dont want it with the southside

(Ain't nothin, ain't nothin, ain't nothin, ain't nothin, ayy)

Yall dont want it with the southside

(ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, crank it)

Yall dont want it with the southside

(ayy, ayy, ain't nothin, ain't nothin, ayy)

(Verse 1 - Lil Scrappy)
Ill leave your ass cripled

Like some frosted flakes

What you call it sneakin up

Tha man Jake the snake

Every nigga on the street

Got something to say

Until they get sprayed in the face

With a gay like mase

I dont hate the fagget

Lets get dashed and crunk

I was lifted by a precher

So my mom pushed weight

Now I hooked up wit game

Real nigga with flame

He show me cali love

And I ain't in no gang

Every nigga that role wit me

Betta keep it G'd

Ill put the verdebrate

Push a DDT

Lets get the sippi

Yall niggas ain't even gifted

Bust a shot at your chin

Your top getting lifted

G's up get your G's up

Scrappy with your weed up

I f**k with g-unit

So yall sake get they ass lumped

Your homeboy really going

Through something

I can't change

I f**k hoes that would make

Mya look lame

(Chorus)

(Verse 2 - Game)
The reallest of niggas

I role wit them killas (yeah)

The world gotta feel us

My clique is gorilla

You niggas in trouble

Im in the track with B-M-E cliqueing

You ain't gotta know

Im sigend to Dre to know that he sick

P-89 thats what I handle my beef with

Put them hollow tips under your arms

Like speedstick

Ride through your hood

In a blue impala

Like we crips

Roll down the tints, G-Unit

Im a head busta, lil scrappy

When the lead touch ya

And they ain't no comming back when you dead f**ker

Sleep in your earn

And get eaten by worms

Trying to fight a fire with

Bottled water heat and get burned

They tampered my phones

Like D-R-E and the firm

'cause im buzzing like WuTang

And it ain't even my turn

So who it may concern

Youll get your whole mouth wide

F**kin with them gang bangers

In the SOUTHSIDE

(Chorus)
(Outro - Lil Scrappy (Game))

Hey hold the muthaf**ker up mi nigga

This your boy little scrappy shorty

(BME) A-town (A-town)

Mi nigga game (Comptown)

You know, its westside (G-G-G-G) in this bitch

They want (G-G-G-G-G-G Unit) to get that ass hit

They wanna get that ass hit

Ayy, ayy, ayy, (G-G-G-G)

Who you lookin at?

Nah not me nigga

Who you lookin at?

Nah not me nigga

Who you lookin at?

(Chorus)
SOUTHSIDE (X2)
