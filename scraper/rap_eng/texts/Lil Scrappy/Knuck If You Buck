Knuck-knuck-kn-kn-kn-kn (it's going down)
Knuck if you buck, boy

[Verse 1: Lil Jay]
Yeah
Well, I'ma gat-toting, pistol-holding nigga on your damn street
Stomping, jumping, bumping, and we crunk off in this damn thing
Throwing them bows up at these hoes, they screaming, they bleeding from they nose
But when we start to swing, we make them niggas hit the flo'
Ain't no game off in this thing, we be deep off in your party
Crime Mob niggas getting started, Ellenwood niggas be the hardest
So, if a nigga come and run they mouth just like a hoe
Punch them dead up in his nose and stomp his ass down to the flo'

[Verse 2: Princess]
Yeah, we knucking and bucking and ready to fight
I betcha I'ma throw them things, so haters best to think twice
See, me, I ain't nothing nice, and Crime Mob, it ain't no stopping
It be like Sadaam Husein, Hitler, and Osama Bin Laden
Now they steady gum popping and I am acting a fool
I wish a hater would get crunk up on this Crime Mob crew
Now, enough is enough, boy, rough and get stuffed, boy
Luck is a must, boy, knuck if you buck, boy

[Hook: Lil Scrappy]
Knuck if you buck, boy

Knuck if you buck, boy
Knuck if you buck
Knuck if you buck
Kn-kn-kn-kn-kn-kn
Knuck if you buck, boy

[Verse 3: M.I.G.]
Jumping off from on the stage, throwing bows like Johnny Cage
All my niggas starting riots, knocking down the barricade
Ellenwood, we be too deep, and M.O.B. is too elite
Flawless niggas, lawless, you'll be jawless getting close to me
Bullets busting constantly, rapping in your city streets
Broken bones lay alone, scattered across the concrete
Knucking if you bucking, you'll be ducking if you get too close
In my eyes, you wasn't wise, I think it's time I knuck you, hoe

[Verse 4: Diamond]
I come in the club, shaking my dreads
Throwing these bows and busting these heads
Bitch irrelevant, step to my residence
Best to back up 'for I send you a lick
I been in drama and committing a crime
Not leaving a trace, not leaving a line
We knucking and bucking 'cause I got a nine
I'll blow you away cause you wasting my time
Stupid ass niggas, I know what to do
I waste your ass, you fuck with my crew
I'm through with you haters, so watch what you do
You talking 'bout me, then I'm talking to you
You bucking on us and we leave you in plastic
You busting on me and that shit gon' get nasty
I'm colder than ice and I'm freezing out here
I target your city, but you cannot tell

[Verse 5: Killa C]
Knuck if you buck, boy, but you betta come equip
I got some shit off in my trunk that's gonna make your body flip
Hollow tips, busting out the rib soon as I hit the do'
Anybody make a false move, dead bodies on the flo'
Fucking with no hoes, ain't never been no lames
Ain't never been no pussy, niggas scared to throw them things, mane
Crime Mob niggas up in this bitch, Break Bread Records I represent
Fucking with them HP niggas, you 'bout to get your wig split

[Hook: Lil Scrappy]
Knuck if you buck, boy
Knuck if you buck, boy
Knuck if you buck, boy
