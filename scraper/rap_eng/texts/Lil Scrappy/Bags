I got a bad bitch and she stupid fine
She a vampire I think she read minds
She like to shop and got her own cash
She like clothe' but really little bags
All she want it bags, how she want it bags
Red bottle high heel don't match the bag
All she want it bags, how she want it bags
Doopie doopie trade don't match the boobies bags
All I want is bags, all I want is bags
Buy me a bag and I'm a know how to bag
All I want is bags, all I want is bags
Buy me a bag and I'm a know how to bag
Cash
You got that little, you got that dorky
If you ain't got them racks
And nigga you ain't even work it
Monday out the [?] Tuesday on the lobbies
[?] bad away their true religion had the bootie
Got me swag, don't mean the bread
Got these mother fuckers mad 'cause the bitch bad
Ball shit, balls bitch
AKA I'm that mother fuckin bottom bitch
Don't play no games stayin in line
Jump the shit for a mother fuckin piece of chain
It's human though this for my real hoes
Know me loud with my bitches and my can foe

Up in the cash up she might hole up I ain't fin it
