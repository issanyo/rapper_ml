(feat. Olivia)

[Chorus:]
Oh
I like that real g shit
You make me loose some
My body's like
Ouuu ouuuuu ouuuu
It's like where ever you ready to do
For the way you do what you do

Oh you love that g-shit when I got you naked?
I play dawg, you can be my passion
Rust me man it's ok bounce with me in slow mo
When they hear the kid in the house it's like oh no
50 got 'em locin again, they open again
Got 'em sippin on that juice and gin
You could find me in the background burnin that backwood
Stylin and stuntin doin my two step frontin
Now I'm a tell you What Em told me homey
Just lose the parental discretion's advised this is grown folk music
Now blend in with me, as I proceed to break it down
It's always off the chain man when I'm around
I play the block bumpin, it was all for the dough
I get the club jumpin, cause I'm sick with flow
You know it's sold out, like wherever I go
I jam packed the show man that's fo' sho'
I got the info you already know
Man I get it poppin in the club everybody show me love let's go

[Chorus:]
Oh
I like that real g shit
You make me loose some
My body's like
Ouuu ouuuuu ouuuu
It's like where ever you ready to do
For the way you do what you do
