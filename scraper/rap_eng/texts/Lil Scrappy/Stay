We're going no stop

Hook:
She got her bags and she talking fast
She throwing things 'cause she super man
She say she can't take it no more
And she's ready to go, and she's out the door
But she wanna stay, she wanna stay
I just tell by the look in her eyes
She wanna stay, she wanna stay
She wanna stay, she's just harder the games in her life
But she wanna stay
She wanna leave with can't stand us in nobody will
On top of that she know she work too hard to get it
You sing the house and god damn acres
And getting still yo scream loud up the waiting neighbors
Shop the spreeze over sea 'cause you believe that
And all this Gucci..you wanna leave that
Your demons got you screaming but I can't hear said your told moe
I guess you can't do like DJ..gonna roll it up
You know I hate it when your ass start acting crazy
'cause your add it to be shit it like a pimp to her baby
You say you wanna leave so I said get out
But I know that I'd go outside in the rain and work the shit out
Look:

Hey, she need God or something like a mentor
She wanna leave but she like the way I get to em
She's bored 'cause all she do is shop and watch cable
I'ma bring the pool home you just set the table
She throwin this man I swear she buggin
She getting at me like I'm so unsuspicious and thug in
If you don't trust me why you love me
You don't love me why you cup me
Yeah you act damn bullshit and you should be feeling lucky
Tell the truth I think you're puffing
And who you ain't gonna do nothing
Throw them bags up in the closet
And bust it over for the fussin
Hey she loving the lights, she lovin the scene
Why wish you on the lean when she's part of the team

[Hook:]
I don't know what she think she doing
