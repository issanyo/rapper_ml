[Intro]
I can't hear y'all turn it up
Motherfucker didn't know I was gonna go crazy over here

[Hook: Lil Scrappy]
I'm back, hotter than a nigga in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell

I'm back, hotter than a nigga in hell
I'm back, know you sick so I'm wishin' you well
I'm back, grindin' hot and tuck in yo' tail
I'm back, soon as I hit da crowd gon' yell, well I'm back

[Verse 1: Lil Scrappy]
Click clack, tha prince is back
Even tho I been here I still owe y'all that
A nigga been low key, but I'm off da rack
Just off da corner sold weed, now I'm back to crack
Had to get some new bullets and some even bigger guns
Movin' in and out of traffic like I'm still on the run
Got my vest on shawty and I'm strappin' a ton
Ev'rythang all good cause I'm fuckin' with Jon
That's where, a nigga straight fell to the airport
Bought 2 first class seats to New York
To see if I could go and ball in the same coat
Me and my bitch both, two guns we tot
A nigga was weak, now the goon is woke
Ain't even no question about the nines I roll
Got hit with a bottle and I still got flow
BME and G-unit, that's all she wrote

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil Scrappy]
On behalf of the first verse, ya know I'm coming
Still deep in the club with my niggas thumpin'
Every show I do, ya know I have um' screaming and jumpin'
Ya niggas still hatin' but ya know they be poppin'
Through the course of this album, ya your boy dun went through it
Like getting pushed off the stage by the police station
I dunno what the hell wrong with all these pigs
Another police touch me and I'm gonna sue him again
He might have been broke, I gotta raise these kids
I don't think some of y'all know what you're playin' with
Had a sick manager who took my benefit
Fuckin' with violator now that picture look real big
On some real shit, my nigga Vic gon' be rich
Pray to God forgive him for the dirt that he did
When I wasn't on TV you forgot about me
I took it upon myself to remind you 'bout me

[Hook]
