[Verse 1: Lil Scrappy]
Yeah, ah, so we fighting, fucking then we loving
In the AM maybe we'll be nothing
And you say you like that real thugging
But you hate it when them
... cuffin
Confused flow, for real though
Love came through the front
Went out the back door
Emotions are running, depression is coming
Can't
Believe you love me, cause your feelings are funny

[Hook] X 2
I'm so tired of going up and down, round and round
I'm so over it, I'm breaking down
I'm bout to call it quits, I done had enough of it
My heart is so cold, I can't find no love here

[Verse 2: Lil Scrappy]
My heart on broken, confidence stolen
Mind going crazy, should I stay or keep going
She don't love me, well I gotta embrace it
If I don't love her, baby girl you gotta face it
The thang about love you can't find it you neither trace it
If love was a test, you either fail or you ace it
Love me, for who I am
If not, shit I don't give a damn
You want the cars, house and designer things
I get it baby girl, you want the finer things
And I ain't hatin on you, go and get it now
Matter fact, go and get it Now, matter fact make daddy proud
Erythang change when you say the L word
Cause I can't say it back I don't know what to tell her
I can't find no love here
You say what is love, it's a powerful word
And it's more than great, man that shit can hurt

[Verse 3: Tocarra]
Got a lot of hard feelings, wall up
Barred up, caught up, start up
Don't wanna fall cause
I can't let another one in

[Hook] X 2
I'm so tired of going up and down, round and round
I'm so over it, I'm breaking down
I'm bout to call it quits, I done had enough of it
My heart is so cold, I can't find no love here

[Verse 4: Lil Scrappy]
Live on the web, we're shooting up the celebs
And I'm goin through hell, wanna release a couple shells
You wanna upgrade baby and that's a fact
But you don't get a nigga just like that
You don't throw away what we had, just like that
You leave a real nigga shawty I bet you come right back
And you say that I cheated in the past, that's true
And in the future I did erythang you asked me Boo
Yeah I cheated and you cheated
But in the end, it's in the wind baby where we meet
It's not the end, we pretend ...
And make this our little secret
Emotional roller coaster, the pain is almost over
The monkey is off my shoulder

[Tocarra]
I can't find no love here
