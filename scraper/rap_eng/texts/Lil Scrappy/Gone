(verse 1)
I really ain't givin a fuck and even if I did,still wouldn't hesitate to split yo weed,pop back
At a wimp like ??
Through da pure ass magic I disappear in traffic,a lot of folks gon hate cuz dey know I'm a fool
And dey know I'ma shit,I finally git out da school,if I spit out da tools,I'll spit out da
Bluez,don't bug it and confuse,I will not lose,I come through on shoes and why 2 hoes choose,on u
Know who,I have no clue,I just do wat I do,I just know wat I know,I'ma tell u once nigga don't
Fuck wit Bo

(Chorus-repeat)

Straight leggin up on folks wit da dubs or digits,I'll hit yo ass so hard,feel like tearin

Pull da steel,don't u think yo cap can't get killed
