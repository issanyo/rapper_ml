[Verse 1:]
I'm a Grady Baby ATL
And all my life duh avis so crunk as hell
You dont' wanna step to close or go to far
Cuz where i'm from shawdy niggas beat you down wit they cars
Fila brought up from my head to my feet
Niggas on the block wit the rock they don't sleep
Man, South dekalb mall be the crunkiest shit
Uh you can roll through buckhead and go to fall on a bitch
I'm a giant ass playa i'll stomp on a hater
I'ma pop the shit off in zone 3, the decatur
We can go back down to where my grandma stay
Depending on the area you better watch what you say
And i 'on care if you over there lookin all crazy
When i get locked up man them broads wanna save me
This the home ass whoopin biscuit in and the chains on the street charge more than the pendent

[Chorus: lil scrappy (lil' jon) 2x]
Forever I love Atlanta
Forever I love Atlanta (what!)

[Verse 2:]
Niggas grind time let my A shine
When i'm bussin rhymes smokin pine
My blood see through the georgia rhine
And niggas don't love the A like i love the A
I just love the way the A smell everyday
A time to yo time yea this how it go smokin dro'
Fuckin' hoes on the city road
When i stomp that bastard I left him with a bruise
Got fila on my feet so it had to be a shoe
I live 4 the A i die 4 the A i ride 4 the A
So fuck what you say
What you know about I-20 to 285
Got a fine atlanta bitch givin head in the ride
Gd's up get yo gd's up in the classroom crunk
Got benny by my Shit so i stay supa drunk
Ridin downtown wit a shot of tiquila
