$50 thousand stuck into my Louis bag
I'm married to the game, call it my newlywed

Born broke nigga, I been on the hustle since
Now my niggas on the board holding corporate meetings
I feel like what I live like
Dead president: covered up in green and white
Oh I love that
Rack up 50 thousand bitch, then it's good night

[Hook]
$50 thousand stuck into my Louis bag
I'm married to the game, call it my newlywed

Live broke or die rich: gotta be persistent
And when I look into my daughter's eyes
It gives a nigga chills

I started with a C-note
Got 2 50-slabs and chopped it
Chopped the whole ounce into 20's then I hit the door
Went in for the 9-piece, now my trap is going live
Now I got enough for a whole thing, so holla back
I call up my connect, tell him I'm ready for the pigeon
Light a tree up bitch!
