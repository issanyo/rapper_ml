Yeah, ey yeah

[Hook:]
I need some niggas to minaj me
Diamonds to massage me
Scrap my low but they call me Mr. Cosby 'cause
I let em suck my pudding pop
I let em suck my pudding pop
Let em suck my pulling cup, let em let em suck my pudding pop
They call me Mr Cosby, they call me Mr Cosby 'cause
I let em suck my pudding pop
I let em suck my pudding pop
Let em suck my pudding pop, let em let em suck my pudding pop
You know she like the strawberry, bananas kill em nilla vanilla
The boy like the fush a real ass nigga
They paint a vivid picture
Mixing before I picture
I'm something like jealous puttie
Ice cold when I liquor
Girl, if I was a beer than you were [?]
The hungsta balls [?] of you right now
Unstoppable the flavor is barely rare
My suggar ball I'm stingy I can even shot
She say scrappy you knows like that seat
'Cause when she on me she's like goodness on the stick
My Kanye book with us don't call me dangerous

[Hook:]
'Cause call me Mr Cosby 'cause
I let em suck my pudding pop

Let em suck my pulling cup, let em let em suck my pudding pop
They call me Mr Cosby, they call me Mr Cosby 'cause

Let em suck my pudding pop, let em let em suck my pudding pop
Yeah pud pud pudding pop, pudding pop

She try to go but she love my pop
May you never gonna see again
I turned her on, on the spot
And you may never gonna see again
And she liked it 'cause she tried it
So excited and she wanna fight it
Then she placed it it's not be crazy
Looking faded this is what she say it
She say she like to pop out the box
The old school feeling, I leave her taste with the shop
I knock her out her socks, while she get a little taste her
The shawty look dick and I try to make it fig
And the nigga say ey
She say she the girl from the calender
We got the same tapes so I'm matching her
And I don't know what kind of flavors doing after her
But the way she throw that pussy to make a message her
And I'm asking her is you cold girl
And do I taste good enough to beating your world
My pudding pop delicious
Don't call me merlow baby call me Mr Cosy 'cause

[Hook:]
'Cause call me Mr Cosby 'cause
I let em suck my pudding pop
