Born be a player but I like you
Got a nigga but she did not wife her
Man I can’t help but to thank what she do
Make a nigga be cool being walk with number 2
Showed her she the shit, I can tell when she sex me
Hop above the dick be home and then she text me
Said she in love but she in the bed with me
Love locked down, she just wanna be free
And I ain’t get nothing, but straight thugging
Give it to her when she want and straight fucking
When she look in my eyes all she do is cry
Can’t contain all the feelings she got inside, I wonder why?

You can be my little secret
You can be the one I creep with
Say, you can be little secret
Just as long as you can keep it
And let hey, ease your mind just close your eyes
Baby let me be your get away
Come to me when you stress inside
And baby I can take away the pain
I’ve been a good boy lately
Girlfriend acting like she hate me
Girl across town wanna date me
Roll a nigga feet, and thinka nigga so fool
Yeah she do all the shit my girl don’t do
I head dreams over ménage, but not Nicki
I hit her jaw, give her a quickie and light hicky
When I’m feeling, sour, she give me the power
Sirock shots on her, at the after hour
Duck … tell yeah, I’m a beast
I pay for that pussy baby no lease
I seen you, and you seen me
I freed you baby so free me

[Hook]
You can be my little secret
You can be the one I creep with
Say, you can be little secret
Just as long as you can keep it
And let hey, ease your mind just close your eyes
Baby let me be your get away
Come to me when you stress inside
And baby I can take away the pain
I just wanna know what you doing
Cause you the only chick I’m pursuing
And we can keep it moving
Girl you know our lives are alike
Why you stay this moment wrong
When the time’s so right
We gotta be low key, no shining lights
When they ask you where you been tell them living life
I seen you, and you seen me
I freed you baby so free me

[Hook]
You can be my little secret
You can be the one I creep with
Say, you can be little secret
Just as long as you can keep it
And let hey, ease your mind just close your eyes
Baby let me be your get away
Come to me when you stress inside
And baby I can take away the pain
