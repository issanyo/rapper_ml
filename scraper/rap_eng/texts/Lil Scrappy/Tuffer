[Intro]
As I get this money
Pass these busters
The game gets rougher
Skin tissue gets tougher

[Verse 1]
I’m so out my mind that my brain is hard to find
Merlot, not my wine
How you doing? I’m doing fine
Where you’ve been? I’ve been on my grind
They say I’m broke, them niggers lyin'
Spit that dope when niggas buying
There's no hope but niggas trying
Nigga's pussy, vaginal
Playing with that beef I turn you into a vegetable
Your girl having thoughts of me, sexual
Don’t get mad at me, get mad at my testicle
I’m the prescription bitch, antidote
2 shots motherfucker, medical
Where the bucks at and are they gettin no action?
I got the nigga stomach hurting just call it contraction
You niggas playing so fugazi and you wear it well
I can't be lazy, buy Mercedes for my baby girl
Looking for me, I’m somewhere across the fucking world
Fucking up the money with no condom like the pussy scared

[Hook]
Tuffer than, tuffer than Nigerian hair
Tuffer than, tuffer than Nigerian hair
Tuffer than, tuffer than Nigerian hair
Nigerian, Nigerian hair
Tuffer than, tuffer than Nigerian hair
Tuffer than, tuffer than Nigerian hair
Tuffer than, tuffer than Nigerian hair
Nigerian, Nigerian hair

[Verse 2]
Scrappy for the hustlers, merlot for you busters
Cooler than the fair, but bitch the money keep me stuck up
I hear them niggas sayin tell them niggas shut the fuck up
Cause I’m still getting bread bitch balling like Butler
And I don’t need bragging ho, I'm just being valid
I'm digging dollar pallets, yes I'm winning like I'm Khaled
Got a fetish for that lettuce so I'm moving like I'm ready
Chips, the bust, what the fuck, tell them niggers we can bet it
Yeh I said it fuck your credit, we can put it all on debit
I'mma curve you like Nike, ho, go ahead and check it
Stay inside your lane, you can’t steer in my direction
Mel Gibson flow, bitch, call it Lethal Weapon
I'm textin another B, cause the last one wasn't doin shit
And I'm stupid rich, with a foolish whip
E Pluribus Unum, y'all counterfeit

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Aiight
Stampede, damn B
Bitches coming at me, all they see is jewellery
All over Scrappy
But not me, Merlot
Can't be no Virgo
Racing to the money and I'm jumpin over hurdles
I treat it like a track meet
Honey you're the trap skeet
Bitch press the mothafuckin game like an athlete
Niggas got amnesia like they don't know Scrappy
Bitches know my mothafuckin name, (what?) nasty

I get it, get it, get it, I’m gone
I get it, get it, get it, I’m gone
I get it, get it, get it, I’m gone
I get it, get it, get it, I’m gone
I get it gone, I get it gone

[Hook]
