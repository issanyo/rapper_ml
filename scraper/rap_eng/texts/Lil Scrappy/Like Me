[Verse 1]
I know you see me shinin'
With the yellow diamond
Don't be thinkin' dat ya boy ain't been grindin'
I was with my momma
And there was alot of drama
We sold crack from the winta all through the summa
Yea, we went through pain
We was stackin' change
Payin' the cost to live in the street, mayn'
Sold cocaine, just a lil' powda
Sellin' weed trynna make a coupla extra dollas
Tha shit I been through, a nigga should've been a schollar
All nite trynna sleep hearin' pistols holla (Damn!!)
Now when ____ died
You know a nigga cried
Not havin' him around
You know it hurt inside
Gotta have shelta ova my lil' sista
Momma wonderin' round cause she a drug deala
I gotta give it to her cause she a real nigga
I'll kill any muthafucka doin' somethin' to her (Yup!!)

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Uhh.. Look
They wanna be on stage, (Riiight)
They wanna get paid (Owh)
But they don't know the hurt (Hurt!)
And they can't feel my pain (owhh!!)
On stage gettin' hit with a bottle
Knocked out, not even know if I'ma rap tommorow (Aye!)
In the hospital, straight bruised up
Got a cut from my lip and my thumbs up (Damn!)
It's kind of fucked up (Yea)
Cuz I was showin' love (Love)
I was givin' hugs (Hugs)
Chillin' with the thugs (Thugs)
All I'm trynna do is show love to err'body
God let me alive so I can tell about it (Amen)
See I don't scream and shout it, but I go to Church
What ya know about puttin' in dat ____ work
They throwin' up signs and they dyin' for it (I'm Crip and a Blood)
Niggas takin' lives goin' jail, payin' fo' it
Ain't nothin' left afta Death but Heaven itself
And if ya go to jail ya seed will have no help

[Chorus till end]
