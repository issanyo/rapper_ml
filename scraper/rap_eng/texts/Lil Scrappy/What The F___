Talkin' all that shit, bitch, take it outside
Pop ya 'bout 3 times, now ya turn clockwise

Damn near took a life, used to call me Chuckie
'Coz I stabbed a man wit a knife

My life tatted on my neck, so you best respect

All I punch is niggas dawg, I don't fight no bitch
I gotta hoe in the car, that'll get up in this shit

Hataz dress to impress but they missed a spot
It takes chest to distress the longevity plot
But I gotta 380 waitin' so, keep ya eyes up off me
Keep ya eyes off my dick an' get ya own damn money

You bony mothafucka, getcha head split right open
I do it in the street an' leave ya neighborhood spoken
An' they hopin' that the mothafuckin' war is over
These lyrics so diverse that a click clack an' break ya shoulder

I done rolled up on the south side of the Av
If you keep lookin', I'ma bust ya ass in ya face
I ain't gon' bless, I'ma just make an example
All that unloyal shit gon getcha fuck ass toppled

When I cock back, my piece is gonna sound like, ?Bam?
Hit ya ass so hard, the fuckin' crowd say, ?Damn
You just got knocked the fuck out"
That's the way we do niggas that's eyein' in the south

What the fuck is goin' on?
What the fuck is goin' on?
That nigga eyein' me, that nigga eyein' me
Fuck, nigga eyein' me, he keep on eyein' me

Fuck, nigga tryin' me, he keep on tryin' me
