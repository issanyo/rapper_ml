OH, and i gave you the cars
Then i give you the moon
Then i show you the stars
Put you in a big ass house
Put money in your purse
Put food in your mouth

And i was real as hell
And all you could give me was a taste of hell
And i told you i cheated
And thats all it takes for you to tell me to beat it?

Dont be offended
Of anything
I might say

YEAH, then i give you a baby
And when i told you i love you
You drive me crazy
Treated you like a queen
So you wouldn't feel like the ugly lady

Oh i gave you the world
And then you walk out my life
Cause i f**ked another girl
Man we gotta get this thing tight
Gotta get this thing right
Cause it kinda sounds like..

Dont be offended
Of anything
I might say

YEAH, then i take 3 or 4 days
To spend time with you. (come on girl)
Came home off the road, shawty
Even when i wasn't supposed to
Sure i gave her a lil' dick
But i gave all my love to you. (come on)
No it ain't about the money

Buts it funny when you get mad, shawty
Cause you never keep it true

Dont be offended
Of anything
I might say

Of course you were there for me
When my mouth was hurt
And a nigga couldn't talk
I remember when you were prgnant
I was there when
You couldn't even walk

No i dont give a f**k about them other hoes
As long as we can live life like gold
Yeah im looking at your pockets
Tey lookin kinda swoll
Do that make you a hoe? (NO)

Dont be offended
Of anything
I might say

OHH, you had drama with my mamma
But i stayed with you ate it all up
Like a runna
And when you find out shit
You got mad and got the hell on
And skeeted on like a road runna
I hope you chill out
Cause you got my baby
And to me shes the number one stunna
You gotta cool that shit down, baby
Even if you dont wanna
You gotta keep it true

Dont be offended
Of the things
I might say
