(repeat X2)
This little piggie ran home(home)
And that little piggie ran home(home)
(x2)
Erroby wanna know what happenned in the land
We had a complication but they dont wanna let it go
Trying to push me, oh bitch police
Actin hard with ya suite but a badge can't fool me

Come on dawg, dont take your job that serious
A gun'll kill any f**kin cat that's curious
Is a lot of hard heads in the streets thas furious
Ain't nothing you can tell, ain't nothing you can do to us
With ya chest all out, trynna be bad
Nigga i can tell you broke 'cause you took my cash
One side of a ? imma whoop yo ass
Come on man why you trynna arrest
Dont wanna let a nigga out the hook wanna go by the book
When we blow dope in our eyes you da biggest crook
Stop actin you know you on that powder
Punk ass probly sniff dope bout a f**kin hour

(chorus)
