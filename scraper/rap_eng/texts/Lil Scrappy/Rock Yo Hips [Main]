Lil Jay on the track nigga
And you already know
It's ya boy Lil Scrappy
We fin' to have the whole motherfuckin world rockin' in this bitch
Shake it shawty, check it out
I like it when she rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips then wave and sip
Look at them hips I like how she rock it
She bend that thing over and to the ground she gon' drop it
And pop it hard as she can, got me hard in the pants
Because she all in her stance doin' her motherfuckin' dance man
Look, lil' buddy cute in the face
She rock her hips to the bass, she take a sip then she wave
And wanna get wit Lil Jay, after she dance on that pole
I pull my cash so quick and fast when that ass hit the flo'
Now I got thirty-two flavors of that bootylicious bubblegum
Raspberry, grape, cherry, come and get this honeybun
Yummy yum baby, not your ordinary lady
Known to drive a nigga crazy, Willy Wonka wanna pay me
On the daily, off the hizzle, rock my hizzle, shake my Skittles
Soda poppin', watch it sizzle, man this shit right here's the shizzle
Smokin' on the highest drizzle, wanna taste it just a little
Rock my hips and make it wiggle, wavin', sippin' in this bizzle
I like it when she rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips then wave and sip
I like it when she rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips then wave and sip
I like it when she show me she can rock 'n' roll it, drop it to the flo'
Bouncin' slow, shorty's all pro, that's the way to go
Jello booty ooh-wee, got a nigga glancin' every time that ass react
"I tawt I taw a puddy cat," gimme gimme gimme dat
Fat cat, don't act on a pimp
You got me enticed by the way you rock them hips
You's a trip girl, doin' all them tricks, that's what's up
I like that shit a lot, come and holla at a thug
A-Town's finest I'm the top notch glamour chick
Tell me if I throw it at cha baby, can you handle it?
â€~Cause the cause is Russian if a hater wanna run they lip
Step up in the club and have them whisperin', "God damn she thick!"
Take it to the bar, Hypnotiq and Hennessy is on my list
Seductively movin' my body, now watch me rock my hips
Take a sip of the Goose, I'm lookin' good and livin' lavish
Big boy pimpin', poppin', dippin', now tell me I'm not the baddest
I walk in the club and she whoppin' and shakin'
I wanna take her to the house so a player start breakin' in
Her motherfuckin' back like a player supposed
God damn lil' buddy, touch yo' toes
God damn lil' buddy, take off yo' clothes
And let me see that apple bottom and that brown booty hole
Shorty slide up and down on that pole
And V.I.P. is how it motherfuckin' goes
I like it when she rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips then wave and sip
I like it when she rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips then wave and sip
She rock her hips, she rock her hips
She rock her hips then wave and sip
