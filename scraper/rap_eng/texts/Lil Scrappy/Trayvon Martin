Punks, these assholes always get away
Those were the words in that grown man's mouth
As he followed in the dark a seventeen-year-old boy who we didn't know
And excuse my language, but those were his words, not mine

Can't just kill a ma'fucka for no reason and get away with it shawty
Gotta have some justice
Whether it's street justice or legal justice

I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
In the hoodie I can walk anywhere I want
Don't shoot me I can do anything I want
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
In the hoodie I can walk anywhere I want
Don't shoot me I can do anything I want

I’m sick and I’m nauseous.This is obnoxious
Even though that it’s obvious.How free the compartments
We was reaching for freedom.Now we’re seeking out justice
Then they get away with it.Like they paid off the judges
Mom and dad cryin.Sad that their son died
It’s killers on TV.Telling these foolish lies
My ronic is advertised.I bomb it on genocide
They takin away pressure lot.Gotta come from my daughter’s eye
And this relief repetedly.I feel like they keep beating me
It’s 1957!They killing people sisters Lee
I feel this all so vividly.I’m losing my identity
Your world is in a crisis.Gotta want what he who stricken me

I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
In the hoodie I can walk anywhere I want
Don't shoot me I can do anything I want
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
In the hoodie I can walk anywhere I want
Don't shoot me I can do anything I want

I walk the streets of my hood No flexin, J cool it
Makin juice and some Skittles.So why did he shoot me?
It was for innocent livin.Them blows were given
I don’t know how he was driven.To the point of no feelin
See I don’t play with folk chillin.So why you come following me?
It’s self-defense.Ain’t nobody harming me
Black and starving,So you call us retarded
Man we build the new skills.Like Malcolm and Martin
We don’t listen to a sharpener.I’mma be the starter
You talkin bout a circus.We do this for a purpose
The world is filled with pottery.People speaking utterly
I’m bout to bail all.And don’t care about who goes with me

I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
In the hoodie I can walk anywhere I want
Don't shoot me I can do anything I want
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
I'm Trayvon Martin
In the hoodie I can walk anywhere I want
Don't shoot me I can do anything I want

He pressed that pistol into Trayvon Martin's chest and pulled the trigger
And then as the smoke and the smell of that fatal gun shot rose
Into a rainy Sunday Sanford night
Trayvon Martin, 21 days removed from his 16th year
Was face down in wet grass laboring through his final breaths
