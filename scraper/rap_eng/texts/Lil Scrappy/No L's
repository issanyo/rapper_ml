Chorus:
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I'll be so high, so high, so high
With the thing on my side, my side, my side
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I ride, I ride, I ride
I'm out of my mind, my mind, my mind
Bitch, I'm often dangerous
Nigga better know you... a bus
Can't a nigga thinking about rolling up?
Or can't a nigga think about riding us?
Put them hands on the wheel, we're... off
Dollars, we hush 'em off
I'm too fat, I may keep 'em up
They keep 'em up, but we're talking up
When it cold outside better...
Nigga my package stay bundle up
Hey, you better go get your money up
Baby, can't get yours, I don't give a fuck!
So I'm riding dirty, on probation
With a nine, twelve behind
So girl no, I don't... my mind
..I do it by one hundred cause I face the time
Ain't no real stopping me
I got a flow, no mocking me
..with a chop of beer
And then I bet the mother fucker won't follow me
They say that I'm a felon, I'll be like so what?
I stay strap when I ride, bitch, I don't give a damn

Chorus:
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I'll be so high, so high, so high
With the thing on my side, my side, my side
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I ride, I ride, I ride
I'm out of my mind, my mind, my mind
Still got the ... up in the back
In a trunk reckless to the max
And they gotta try right next to that
And a bullet convincing that's bad
If the.. put me.. it's a...
And I'm all going back down the...
And I'm all going get my nigga down
Shit, I don't know, I run them out!
Miami, Atlanta, DC, Alabama
Shut time and Carolina, the white girl is...
Sweet... that gets paid
New York, you gonna show
LA and Vegas, I still get to them papers
They sent me a subpoena said I had to come and see 'em
I just got me a warrant, so you know I couldn't see them
If they say it's crap, you're famous
I'm like so what?
..show up in court, bitch I don't give a fuck!

Chorus:
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I'll be so high, so high, so high
With the thing on my side, my side, my side
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I ride, I ride, I ride
I'm out of my mind, my mind, my mind
Ride with no L's yeah, ride with no L's
Ride with no L's yeah, ride with no L's
I said I ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I said I ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I said I ride with no L's, ride with no L's
Go, go, go, go!
Go, go, go, go!

Chorus:
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I'll be so high, so high, so high
With the thing on my side, my side, my side
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
They got me ride with no L's, ride with no L's
I ride, I ride, I ride
I'm out of my mind, my mind, my mind
