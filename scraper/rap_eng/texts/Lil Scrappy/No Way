Hook
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
Call me a quitter
No Way, No Way
A broke nigga
No Way, No Way
I'm worried bout a bitch
No Way, No Way
I'm scared to get rich
No Way, No Way

DC Reverie Verse

Ay Yo
You stupid niggas think my songs be about you
You do a lot of slick dissin in yo post too
You got opinions bout my work but ain't nothing new
Im just damned if I don't, I'm damned if i do
I'm gettin money so the haters start to learn my name
But I forget them when I realize that they all the same
I've been deprived of what I wanted since my first day
So I'm just ready to get this shit in my own way
Cuz this is everything I ever thought it could be
For all my loyal niggas that stayed true to me
Them bitches telling me go right, but I went left
I guess it's good I listen to my got damn self
You never had shit good to say about my life
But now I'm getting bread so you handing me your knife
For all them thirsty ass hoes trying to get laid
Ima be the only mutha fucka getting paid

Hook
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
Call me a quitter
No Way, No Way
A broke nigga
No Way, No Way
I'm worried bout a bitch
No Way, No Way
I'm scared to get rich
No Way, No Way

Lil Scrappy Verse

Merlo
See my life filled with dedication
These niggas hating on my situation
These niggas need medication
Because they suffer real refuckeration
Look, I'm up in the book, known as a crook
All the pain I took, I'll never be shook
Use to politic while I was moving bricks
When Ma Dukes had the flyest shit
PoPo, they was taking pics
When i was riding round hitting all them licks
So hate if you want, gone head do your own thing
I'm popping the trunk, I'm finna kill the whole gang
Long flights and ciroc nights
Big ice nigga my life
Scrap hit em bout once or twice
Then I'm out, it's bye bye
All real ain't no running
All my goons we straight bussin
Keep my head up I know they coming
I'm One Thousand, nigga fuck A hundred


Hook
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
I keep my head up, middle fingers higher
Call me a quitter
No Way, No Way
A broke nigga
No Way, No Way
I'm worried bout a bitch
No Way, No Way
I'm scared to get rich
No Way, No Way
