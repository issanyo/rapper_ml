[Intro: Lil Scrappy]
You ain't know
You ain't know
You ain't know
You ain't know

[Hook: Lil Scrappy]
I'mma go and hit ya bitch first (you ain't know)
After that then go in her purse (you ain't know)
Dog her out if the pussy is the worst (you ain't know)
Know all the niggas with the fuckin' work (you ain't know)
Holla at ya boy if you want the purp (you ain't know)
Talk shit then ya get ya ass murked (you ain't know)
Showin out gone get ya feelings hurt (you ain't know)
And I'm to real to have my name in da dirt (you ain't know)

[Verse 1: Lil Scrappy]
What's up nigga is you lame wit no name
Cryin on my phone cause you ain't got no brain
It ain't my fault cause yo brain can't explain
Da and missles the pain that you get from the cain
I went through da sunshine and da rain but I had to maintain
Walkin' bus to a plane
They knocked me out but I still feel da same
Can anybody help me, Can you feel my pain
Speeding down da highway
Truck an impress
Got da tool on my seat, and da vest on my chest
I'm da 05 chain ya ain't stuck in da rain
I'm so fine, no lie, shorty just gave me da brain
I'm too real, I give dap to errbody
And I don't give a fuck I'll slap errbody
And you don't like me
And I don't like you
You go around and fuck my bitch
And Imma fuck yours too

[Verse 2: Lil Scrappy]
I keep it poppin' ain't no stopping
Pistols poppin' heads dropping niggas
Dats mad at me 'cause they fuckin' wind is floppin
I'm da topic wheels choppin
Haters watchin
Niggas poppin' dem thangs dat a leave ya damn head rockin'
I don't recommend dat you don't pay attention
Until maturally you in the fetal position
Scrappy be getting money
Yeah I know you was wishing
Sayin' a nigga ain't real, you was bullshitting
I was born as a militant midget
I got guns and funds and a nigga can get it
I got da cain, bet ya 15 digits
I got that hard night-quil, if you need a fixin
I bombard 'em straight charge em
My boys shoot towards any cop and squad em
No leg no arm I kick rocks you lame
Lyrics so sick you form a voice spear round ya dame

[Verse 3: Bohagon]
Now off top I'm Bohagon

Understand what I'm sayin'

Gotta couple bad bitches
Gotta few girls dat take me state to state
And help me make da cake

Might cost a couple grand

So when shit fuck up I know dat shit in advance
Niggas wanna play wit it thank it's a game and
Come at me sideways
Thank I'm a lame like I ain't got real shit running through my veins
Like I want pull that real thang and bust those veins

Given alot more brain
