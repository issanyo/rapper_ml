[Verse 3]
Hataz dress to impress, but they missed a spot
It takes chest to distress the longevity pot
But I gotta 380 ready, keep ya eyes up off me
Keep ya eyes off my dick, and get ya own damn money
You bony mothafucka getcha head split right open
I do it in the street, and leave ya neighborhood spoken
And they hopin that the mothafuckin war is over
These lyrics so diverse that a click-clack and break ya shoulder
I done rolled up on the southside of the 'A'
If you keep lookin, I'ma bust ya ass in the face
I ain't gon bless, I'ma just make an example
All that unloyal shit, gon getcha fuck ass ???
When I cock back, my piece is gonna sound like BAM
Hit ya ass so hard, the fuckin crowd say damn
"You just got knocked the fuck out"
That's the way we do niggas that be eyein in the south

[Chorus]
What the fuck is goin' on
What the fuck is goin' on
That nigga eyein' me
That nigga eyein' me
Fuck nigga eyein 'me
He keep on eyein' me
What the fuck is goin' on
What the fuck is goin' on
That nigga tryin' me
That nigga tryin' me
Fuck nigga tryin' me
He keep on tryin' me
