[Intro]
Dear lord
Hope you can look, deep into my heart
And know that I mean good, can you forgive me for all my sins

G's up
It's a g thang
You motherfuckers know me man
G's up
It's a g thang
(eeeaaayyyy) B.M.E

[Chorus: Lil Scrappy]
Lord have mercy on me
Heard a nigga say there's a heaven for a g
If there is please save a spot for me
I don't wanna burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me
Ridin around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me
I don't wanna burn
No, no

[Verse 1]
Dear lord, this a letter to you
A young nigga hurt and I don't know what to do
I try to live life right but these cowards hatin'
It's like everywere I go I run into satan
Im on this earth, with my blessing and my curse
Just thinking that how we live
The ridin hurts
Even though you know me
Ever since I was birth
I'm innocent 'till you judge me and that comes first
And I ain't trying to burn lord 'cause that's the worst
Forgive me for backsliding on the rock for the thirst
I knew it was wrong got to snatching the purse
But it was cold outside I couldn't afford a shirt
Yeah I wanna go to church
But I can't be faithful
I'm always doing shows but you know that I'm grateful
I turn weak for the fruit 'cause it be tasteful
I dunno how in the world I can ever repay you

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy on me
Heard a nigga say there's a heaven for a g
If there is please save a spot for me
I don't wanna burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me
Ridin around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me
I don't wanna burn
No, no

Hey Chris can you sit your little ass down my nigga
Dammm, I can't even write to god, shit

[Verse 2]
Dear lord I thank you for looking out for my fam
Helping my little brother who don't give a damn
You see my little sister done got pregnant
And my moma acting crazy it ain't changin'
And I pray, that you keep my pops preachin'
Cause if he ain't around there's nobody teachin'
And please keep my baby mama from bitchin'
Excuse my language lord but it's always friction
I wanna thank you for blessing me with my little girl
But please give me the power to fight the whole world
'Cause I swear on you if they touch my kid
I'ma be sittin down writing to you again

[Chorus]
Lord have mercy on me
Heard a nigga say there's a heaven for a g
If there is please save a spot for me
I don't wanna burn
I hit a nigga up before a nigga hit me
Ridin around with my strap on me
Just in case a nigga wanna fucking clap me
I don't wanna burn
No, no
