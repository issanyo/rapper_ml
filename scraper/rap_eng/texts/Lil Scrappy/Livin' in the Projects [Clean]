Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
Livin' in the projects broke with no lights on and I was

Growing up off section A
Momma in the other rooms cryin' b'cause she got bills to pay
And it ain't no chores to play
Only thing to outside is a sand box and a gate to hate
And the show ain't gonna show money, soul of a show money
Only thing around town Brooklyn is that *** money
(Livin' in the projects)
Dem boys on the corner and there pockets
Getting stronger momma did it for the hunger
We sold about a hundred, everybody still running
And we sitting on the block b'cause the *** feigns rolling
Videos, I ain't trynna be no rap
I ain't tynna be no act, I'm trying to make my stack up
(Livin' in the projects)
I ain't gotta chiropractor, so if I'm on the streets
Then come greet or tear my back up
(Livin' in the projects)
The police better call back up
B'cause if I can't feed my daughter, I'mma come and rob ya' and I was
Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
Livin' in the projects broke with no lights on and I was
Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects

Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
Livin' in the projects broke with no lights on and we was
Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
Livin' in the projects broke with no lights on
Remember when the food stamps used to look like dollars
I ain't have no clothes so the *** wouldn't holla
Get outta here would all a *** want
When I hit the lights all the roaches hit the floor, ***
Momma had got into a accident
It's *** up man she can't even pay the rent
And the heat and light been out ever since
So you know when a *** gone it get cold in the ***
You know what I'm gonna do? I'mma go get rich
Put on my ski mask and go hit me a liq
It's all you could do when you young and from the BrixÃ¢s
I'm from the hood lil' shawty I'mma represent and I was
Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
Livin' in the projects broke with no lights on and I was
Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects

Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
Livin' in the projects broke with no lights on and we was
Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
Livin' in the projects broke with no lights on
Now it was never ever supposed to be like this
My teacher told me I wasn't gonna be ***
A surely young *** when our dad got rich
A-town *** you can *** my ***
Now you made it outta the projects, a young *** getting cash
Gotta keep that steady flow running while the time past
Can't let them get you down move or be moved out
Gotta get that money shawty, that's what I'm talking about
When time get hard better pray to God
Don't stretch the *** game on the boulevard
No, my daughter never will
And if I have to kill she gonna get another meal
***, play the hand I was dealed
If a man stepped to me I got a right to grab the steel
Chyea, I'm on top and I still remember
Those cold *** days in December and I was
Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
Livin' in the projects broke with no lights on and I was
Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
Livin' in the projects broke with no lights and you was

Livin' in the projects broke with no lights on and we was
Livin' in the projects, livin' in the projects
