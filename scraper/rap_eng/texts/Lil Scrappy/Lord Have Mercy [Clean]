Dear Lord, I hope You look deep into my heart
And know that I mean good
And You can forgive me for all my sins
G's up it's a G thang
Y'all motherfuckers know me mane
G's up it's a G thang near me
Lord have mercy on me, heard *** say there's a heaven for a G
If there is please save a spot for me, I don't want to burn
I hit a *** up before a *** hit me, ridin' around with my *** on me
Just in case a *** wanna *** clap me, I don't wanna burn, no no
Dear Lord, it's a letter to You
A young *** hurtin' and I don't know what to do
I try to live life right but these cowards be hatin'
It's like every where I go I run into the same
I'm on this earth with my blessings and my curse
Just thinking how we live threw riddin' the hearse
Even though You know me ever since I was birth
I'm innocent till You judge me and that comes first
And I ain't tryin' to burn Lord 'cause that's the worst
Forgive me for backsliding, I only rob for the thirst
I knew it was wrong that I was snatching her purse
But it was cold outside I couldn't afford a shirt
Yeah, I wanna go to church but I can't be faithful
I'm always doin' shows but You know that I'm greatfull
I churn wheat for the fruit 'cause it be tasteful
I don't know in the world how I could ever repay You
Lord have mercy on me, heard *** say there's a heaven for a G
If there is please save a spot for me, I don't want to burn
I hit a *** up before a *** hit me, ridin' around with my *** on me
Just in case a *** wanna *** clap me, I don't wanna burn, no no
Aye Chris, can you sit your *** down my ***?
Damn a man can't even write to God
Dear Lord, I thank You for lookin' out for my fam
Havin' my lil' brother who don't give a damn
You see my lil' sista done got pregnant
And my momma actin' crazy and ain't changin'
And I pray that You keep my pops preachin'
'Cause if he ain't around there's no body teachin'
And please keep my baby momma from being a ***
Excuse my language Lord but it's always friction
I wanna thank You for blessing me with my little girl
But please give me the power to fight the whole world
'Cause I swear on You if they touch my kid
I'ma be sitting down writing You again
Lord have mercy on me, heard *** say there's a heaven for a G
If there is please save a spot for me, I don't want to burn
I hit a *** up before a *** hit me, ridin' around with my *** on me
Just in case a *** wanna *** clap me, I don't wanna burn, no no
