[Verse 1: Dirty Mouth]
Just like I said, get the fuck back
Get up on my level jack
Bread and chips is all I stack
Roll a seven, bring it back
Never crapped out
'Cause my pimpin' is too slick for that
But if you think I'm jokin' then I guess
That's yo ass jacked
Beat 'em down, stomp 'em out
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Dirty Mouth off in this bitch
Trillville, we represent
Any city, any hood
Any state, it's all good
Wish you lames can get up on my level
But you never could
In the club, throwin' bows
Niggas grillin' with they gold
Mean muggin' hard, 'cause they crunk out the rainbow
BME, is the clique, North, South, East and West
Get up on my level cause my clique is the fuckin' best

[Verse 2: Twista]
Nigga I got too many stars, too many stripes
Too many thumpers, and too many pipes
Get up in the club, I'm a kill in the fight
Hit 'em in the mouth with the left and a right
Fuck yo boys, fuck yo laws
Keep lookin' at me I'm a hit 'em in the jaw
Mac-11, 30 calibers, and SK's
In the trunk for the haters if you really wanna draw
See a bitch, smack a bitch
Up that thing, then my gat to click
Bust yo dome in the back of it
Then I ride to the black Cadillac and split
If you do really wanna get the picture then I gotta hit you with real steel
Let it ride then I scream "You can't fuck with Twista and Trillville!"
Cause we got them thangs, got that dust
When I'm in the club, gurls twerk that butt
Make them shawties wanna cut
With the spinners on the Benz, 24's on the truck
Wood and leather
You really wanna get ahead of motherfuckers like me
But I'm bringin' better cheddar
When it come to out-doin' motherfuckers like me
Nigga you could neva eva

[Chorus: Trillville, Lil Jon & Don P]
Bitch nigga, you can neva eva
Eva eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva
Get on my level, ho! What!
Get on my level, ho! What!
Get on my level, ho! What! (Yeeeahhh!!)
Get on my level, ho! What!
Bitch nigga, you can neva eva
Eva eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva
Get on my level, ho! What!
Get on my level, ho! What!
Get on my level, ho! What! (Yeeeahhh!!)
Get on my level, ho! What!

[Verse 3: Don P]
My, my Benz, look at my 'Ac
Look at my Benz, look at my 'Ac
Get on, get on my level, hell nah neva that
Get on, get on my level, hell nah neva that
My nigga chill, let a nigga know
Your clique: 1, my clique: 4
Lookin' at my watch, time for y'all boys to go
I used to get in hell but that's when I was broke
Always crunk with my niggas - usually
Always drunk with my niggas - usually
Think this shit a joke, Mr. D.L. Hughley?
Poppin' at the mouth, how 'bout ya life
Ya feel like losin'?
Yeeeeeah! Now take that
I knew you wasn't real 'cause all you do is chit-chat
High, drunk and drunk and get my, get my roll back
High, drunk and drunk and get my, get my throwback
Yeeeaaah!

[Verse 4: Lil Atlanta]
Lil LA off in this bitch, ya still ain't on my level ho
Crunk as fuck, ready to buck, ya better duck, we comin' four
Get on the floor, kick down ya door
Skip, passed to me and I got the 'dro
And I'm on pose, so what ya know about the ATL, ho
It's what we play, "Trillville U.S.A."
It's three times as real, any city, any state
Evacuate the place or catch a blow to ya face
Them niggas think they hard, sweet as muthfuckin' cake
A cupcake, a mistake
Hit ya dead in ya mouth
Now what we reppin' mothafuck?
That dirty south
So throw your clique up nigga, we stompin' it out
And if ya smell like trash, we takin' ya out
Bitch

[Chorus: Trillville, Lil Jon & Don P]
Bitch nigga, you can neva eva
Eva eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva
Get on my level, ho! What!
Get on my level, ho! What!
Get on my level, ho! What! (Yeeeahhh!!)
Get on my level, ho! What!
Bitch nigga, you can neva eva
Eva eva, eva eva, eva eva, eva eva
Get on my level, ho! What!
Get on my level, ho! What!
Get on my level, ho! What! (Yeeeahhh!!)
Get on my level, ho! What!

[Outro: Lil Jon]
When I see you duck

Run around the motherfuckin' club!
Run around the motherfuckin' club!
Run around the motherfuckin' club!
Run around the motherfuckin' club!
