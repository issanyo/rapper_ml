I'm made up my mind that I'ma strike (background - wha wha ...)and I'm ready to fight
Checkin out my steel killin every punk nigga in site
We expite, I knew you bitches didn't wanna brawl (uh what you say?)
Bitch I'll swang on all of y'all
I'm the beast from the east, wit da fangs on my teeth
I'll murder all of y'all bitches in da middle of da street
And I don't give a fuck if you don't like me
Straight knock yo ass out in captain T !
Down south, I'll ride, shoot and kill homicide
It be nothin shawty till the day that I die
We strive, on tearin heads up !
And everywhere we go we gon tear dat bitch up

Dat ain't got my back and ain't takin no shit
Excruse me shawty, get the fuck out my face
Befo' we get mad and shoot up the whole place

(Chorus)
I speak my mind, cuz bitin my tongue hurt
Murder yo ass and lyrics and put ya face on a shirt
I'm a mothafuckin rida, cuz I thought y'all knew
And I reppin nothin even it's twenty of you
I think it's plenty of you that really want da shawty dead
Watch what ya said lil shawty, I'm makin bread
Fuck all y'all born hataz wit hatred born to match
A long way but plus I roll wit G's and Gat'z
And shawty matter of fact these trill g's and dub's
We ain't talkin behind yo back and we ain't scared to bust
I'm by myself, but bein alone makes you strong
I stepped out the porch young, so shawty I been grown

(Chorus)
ATL off da chain down here
Ya come wit dat gat and no action, you gon disappear
You walk in da club, it's tight like brass knuckles
Straight info on hata like be chumpin off turned brothas
Beatin in ya door with dat clip on da tech
Beatin down ya block in that 89' Chevy
Tellin stupid bros we throwin bows that we ready
Screamin "swang shawty" to da boys dat can't stand me
Yeah shawty - I'ma ATL slugga
Knockin out heads on you pussy mothafuckaz
Shawty be sayin "scrap you cool boy"
But I known in my heart dat I'ma headbussa boy !

(Chorus)
