Get some crunk in yo system! {​*repeat 8X*}​
(Rapper talking in background)

[Verse 1]
I can feel it
These haters don't like me
They see me at a show
Them niggas get excited
Cuz they think they finna get me
But nigga I'mma riot
Found myself a riot
So nigga don't try it
Guns I collect 'em
Guns fo' protection
Guns fo' dat nigga dat tried me and learned a lesson
And ain't no second guessin
I'm good wit my weapon
I ain't never been a lame in da game I'm respectin
???
I'm looking fo' trouble
My own label just found out that I'm a monsta
But its too late cuz I signed for a hundred
It's something
Ain't nothing
I'm roofless
Still producing
Cut me a tape and you'll buy yoself two
???
Niggas say I'm trill
They ain't hard I can prove it
YEEAAAHHHH!!!

[Verse 2]
I'm sippin on da crunk juice
Hennessey to get me loose
Niggas getting buck and shit
Drinkin all da grey goose
Throwin signs up in da air
Representin from wher I came
Its da same shit in da club niggas fightin mane
Throwin bows and breakin chairs
Niggas pullin hoes hair
Runnin threw the club wit dey click cuz they don't care
Screamin out whateva side
All my niggas down to ride
If you think I'm lyin then you pussy niggas bet not try

Bustin niggas brains over fuckin wit my game ho

[Verse 3]
Guess who they called up
Out of the wood works
Take off my fuckin shirt
I'm reppin to da dirt
I'm reppin to da grave
I'm reppin for da 'A'
I'm ridin twenty-one
On my impala son
I'm smoking big dro

Her cousin got da blow
We kicked dat nigga do'
Off da hinges
I'm relentess
I represent this
Can I get a witness (Amen!)
Amen I work hard for da south
These niggas playin hard with they thumb in they mouth
The house the car
The bitches bustin out they bras
Just so they can show they titties to a star
Baby my door ajar
The passenger too

So what's up boo

Keepin it trill (trill)
Reppin da ville (ville)
