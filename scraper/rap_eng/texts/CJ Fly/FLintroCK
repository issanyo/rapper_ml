This is the way I see it
This is the way I see it
This is the way I see it
This is the way
FLY

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Got ‘em thinking he saw so it’s less than likely he solve
Gotta be street smart
Not come off as weak heart
My chest is filled with sour, though chicks call me sweetheart
He sparks tree bark when he walks through the park
Getting high off the low like a fucking see-saw
Check it always got the answers not the one to cheat off
Still not the one to test
I’m nothing like the rest
From Bed Stuy
And still not the one to sleep on
From the depths of hell
Who dumb enough to ring my effing bell
Lucky I ain’t hang his ass from his tail
[?] we into sorcery you can’t even tell
Catastrophe these cats should be up in my casualty kills
I’m saying "Oh I got that fire if you down to smoke"
I looked at him like he was stupid laughing at his joke
Was wondering how he was feeling ‘cause the game switch
Made him think he feel with his lines yeah a sales pitch
Then it’s time of reckoning
57 shares so I’ma let him in only because I’m feelin’ -
Well think he would try to be a tab bit more intelligent
I damage it and I put that on everything
I haven’t sinned because I know I am heaven sent
Put in my two cents and now they say they smelling it
And this pros been a con ever since
The development of melanin into his very skin
