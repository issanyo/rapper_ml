[Verse 1]
Wrote this song and I got cold chills
Old enough to pay my own bills
This how living on your own feels
How did I do this shit with no deal
I was never one to coattail
Working hard I know I won’t fail
How the hell you keep it so real?
So much bars could have my own jail
So much flows could own a hotel
If it ain't Roshes then I won’t wear
They talk shit but no I don’t care
Swear my future lookin' so clear
Go to work but I don't ever clock in
I can’t take the risk that’s why I gotta watch them
They conspirin' and all these haters plottin'
Gotta thank the maker
I’m still that Jamaican
Take a sheet of papers then I put the plot in
Then I’m gettin' higher
No I ain’t the hardest but I’m still a product
Think about it when they ask me when I’m droppin'

[Hook]
Tell me why they been prayin'
Tell me why they been prayin'
Tell me why they been prayin'
Prayin' for my downfall
Tell me why they been prayin'
Tell me why they been prayin'
Tell me why they been prayin'
Prayin' for my downfall
Tell me why they been prayin'
Tell me why they been prayin'
Tell me why they been prayin'
Prayin' for my downfall
Tell me why they been prayin'
Tell me why they been prayin'
Tell me why they been prayin'
Prayin' for my downfall

[Verse 2]
I’m just me I cannot be no other nigga
Ain’t a lot of cats out there that’s fucking with us
They can’t touch us because we got a couple hitters
My whole squad the coldest get cold bumps and shivers
So much on the line I’m not your average critter
Gotta watch the snakes as soon as you see them slither
So deceptional because they try to trick ya
And protect your neck because they might just slit ya
Now I view things different
Probably cause this is a new commitment
Can’t be sluggish gotta move with swiftness
Drink the b no tops so we get lifted
Kids is wildin' abusing prescriptions
Generation got a few addictions
Show they lights, seems like it’s the mission
They can’t stop us got no inhibition
So we need to fix things
