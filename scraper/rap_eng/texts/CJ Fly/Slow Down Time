[Intro/Interview: 2Pac]
So, what type of women would it take?
A very, very, very strong women
And, one who was more in love with me, than i was
Because i have to be more in love with her, than she is
And that's what it is, and every time i fall in love in with a woman
I dont fall in love with the woman she is
I fall in the love with the woman she could be
I haven't found a woman, yet
That fit's up to my standards (okay)
And I'm sure i dont fit up to anybody's standard

But I haven't found one yet, but I've found one's that i think
That have the potential to be rawest woman in the world
Ya' know what I am? I feel like it's natural
For a man, especially being black to feel like he's a king
And he's looking for his queen, and that's where I'm at right now

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Starring at blue sky's, I remember your blue eyes
Kick it wit'chu, it don't matter what's you shoe size
I'm crazy 'bout you, but you still keep me sane
I'm saying beauty and brains go well with your name
When we first met, I still remember the day
Don't trip, let's take a trip down memory lane
I know you're mine, 'cause our soul's are entwined
I know we're young, but girl you are the one
My love for you, what I could never deny
Everything is great and only getting better with time
If I stole your heart, they'd probably give me federal time
What we both have is ours, but the pleasure is mine

[Bridge]
There's something that ain't hard to see
Give you my heart, blood, veins and my arteries
You're my world, but you won't learn that in geology
I can tell your my philosophy, girl I can be your Socrates

[Hook: T'nah Apex]
Every time I think about you
I can't get you off my mind
Anytime i get around you
I wish we could slow down time

[Verse 2: Dessy Hinds]
Time couldn't proceed without me having that dream girl
Sometime's the way you think it's real is in a dream girl
It is what it seems, I'm making it true
But the only way it seems like making it, is if it's with you
I grab my, pen and my pad, write feeling I ain't know I had
Simplicity beauty is something you never know you have
So I noticed that, but still you gotta know the fact's
And know it ain't fo' show, but if it is I'm the opening act
I turn the mack on, so vigorous with the rap songs
If your voice was a beat it would be something I would rap on
And really add on, my impeccable lines of elements
And every record I make replace's lame compliments
The confidence would never condescend, the astonishment
You the bad one, and I'm the one you wanna punishment
For you it's like I'm punishing for publishing 'til tip-top
It's Dessy, now this is what you call real love and Hip-Hop
