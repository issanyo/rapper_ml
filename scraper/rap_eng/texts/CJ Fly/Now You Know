[Intro]
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know

[Hook]
Now you know you fucked up
Cause a nigga lucked up
Now you really look dumb
Tell me how that shit go
Tell me how that shit go
Now you know you fucked up
Cause a nigga lucked up
Now you really look dumb
Tell me how that shit go
Tell me how that shit go

[Verse]
(FLY!)
Seen too many niggas switch sides
Getting tired of the dick riding
You Luke Warm, I'm John Blaze, my shits fire
Either in the stu or I'm getting high
I don't make a lot but I'm getting by
I know I've sinned but a nigga try
I could roll this weed in a nick of time
Toby break it down smell a whiff of pine
Only 22, so I'm in my prime
Made it here without committing crimes
Making paper off some different lines
Took my life and put it in these rhymes
Transformation like I'm megatron
Give my music everything I got
And I don't think that I'll ever stop
A liter you won't catch me with a fo
Some people say that Iâ€™m a witty foe
Why the hell a nigga quitting for
Gotta get a mansion to put in my folks
I just gotta make a bigger quote (x2)

[Hook]
Now you know you fucked up
Cause a nigga lucked up
Now you really look dumb
Tell me how that shit go
Tell me how that shit go
Now you know you fucked up
Cause a nigga lucked up
Now you really look dumb
Tell me how that shit go
Tell me how that shit go

[Outro]
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you hear this and you know
Hope you...
