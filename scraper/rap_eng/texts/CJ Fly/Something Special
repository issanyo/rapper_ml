[Chorus]
I've been waiting all year long
For this day to finally come
[?] once
All the gifts to open up
Even if we don't get much
And don't get all that we want
We don't [?] we still got us
Something special 'bout Christmas
Something special 'bout Christmas, yeah
Something special

[Verse]
Gotta be a miracle, pray for snow
Ain't no surprise the weather getting cold
Winter wonderland
Outside you gotta wear a coat
Singing carols
All the children playing in the snow
Some of us don't got no plans, got nowhere to go
Christmas just ain't what it was for me some years ago
When Thanksgiving come around I know it's getting close
Break the eggnog out because it's time to make a toast
[?]
Remember when I was a kid
When I would get tons of gifts
I knew where they all were hid
Memories that I won't forget
I waited a whole damn year
For some toys and some beer
Losing you's my only fear
Next time ho, you gon' be here

[Chorus]
I've been waiting all year long
For this day to finally come
[?] once
All the gifts to open up
Even if we don't get much
And don't get all that we want
We don't [?] we still got us
Something special 'bout Christmas
Something special 'bout Christmas, yeah
Something special
