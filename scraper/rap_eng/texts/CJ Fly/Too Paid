[Intro]
Want to change my ways but just trying to make a decent pay
Fuck working for the man I want my shit the easy way
I'm scheming on the block just trying to find a get away

[Verse 1]
Had way too many sleepless nights
Compete with guys delete on sight
If you selling white add a cheaper price
Truth is it don't matter about your brain matter
Your brain splatter you slang cane, it slang faster
The same bastard that aim at ya, gave you the name Casper
To have you in a wood grain casket
You had your shot, now your going to the top for a kick
When you'll return, I'm just hoping that you got your receipt
Oh you'll be calling people's phones like you forgot about me, sheesh
I suggest you take a different route
Got my home smelling like weed, yo mom gon' kick you out
Get a job set some goals man, plan to get a house
We all tryna get this cheddar but sometimes there's bigger mouse
We all got dreams and sometimes we try live em out
Gotta make it happen, opportunities ain't given out
Ain't nothing but Swiss accounts with nothing but big amounts

[Hook]
Want to change my ways but just trying to make a decent pay
Fuck working for the man I want my shit the easy way
I'm scheming on the block just trying to find a get away
I'm getting laid while I'm in a daze
I'm too paid and headed for the top like toupe's
Cooking up that recipe like soufle's
On the real I'm hoping for a new day
I just hope i got time and I ain't too late
I'm too paid and headed for the top like toupe's
Cooking up that recipe like soufle's
On the real I'm hoping for a new day
I just hope i got time and I ain't too late

[Verse 2]
Clay you been in the can for spraying cats but couldn't hurt a Fly
You don't wanna be versus I cus when i lurk inside I'm murking gods
I versify rehearse my lines to the (?)
Living devine bending trees like turpentine
We ain't missing any components
So puff on it, on our buddha it come potent
I'm up on it, Show me who my next opponent
I unload, the gun blow
?
Then I roll up in a rag top
I'm just a young half knot
Reach in stash spots
To blast *Bleep*
I cook 'em like lamb chop
Blood all on the floor like a backdrop
? Caps lock
I breeze from then scene cause I ain't tryna be seen
Pay the price for you to fine, I ain't tryna be mean
No I ain't trying to be mean
No what I mean? I'm just tryna get green

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Don't get it mistaken
You you could get your miss taken
Forget changing I'm tryna be known for risk taking
Even chicks with buns get Nathan's
Them Pros get ?
We burning down, not a sound even though it's loud
See them how I'm serving round when I murder clouds
Staying in the same time zone when I purchase pounds
Once a bag is filled, she don't care if her purse's in style
Sargent Fly shit is my ?
And shit get hot, I'm entertained
I start to fire I'm letting them go
? well I'm pedaling dough
And I know the world will better, days to come
But I ain't trying to be dead at very young
Sometimes it feels like I'm ahead of everyone
Can't tell you what it was, but I guess it's where I'm from

[Hook]
