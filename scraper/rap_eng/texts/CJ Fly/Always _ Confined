Always

[Intro]
Uhh, turn me up a lil' bit

[Pre-Hook]
You'll be with me always
I know you'll be with me

[Verse]
Uhh, something like my guardian
Watch over me 'cause I can only see so far from start to end
I'm on tree like ornaments
See my best giving all I can
Hurry so bad like I caught a cramp

The only nigga I would ever call my granps

[Hook]
You'll be with me always
You'll be with me always

[Skit]
All you can do is do your best until the day come

Confined

[Intro]
Fly!

[Hook]
I got a lot on my mind, trying to not go insane
I know I got so much pride, don't really like asking for things
Got way too much on the line, people depending on me
At times I feel so confined but I'm gon' have to break free

[Bridge]
So confined
So confined

[Verse]
Shooting for the stars and they [?] around
Got too much supporters and I can't let 'em down
Now i'm in the wick like the candle lit now
When my grandfather passed he got buried in the ground
Got so depressed smoked the cannabis down
Now it can't help us out, I'm so sad that you gone
You the only grandad that I've known
Only dad that he know, you ain't even get to catch you a show
Dealing with this shit is mad difficult, you don't have to move on
That is something you just have to endure
Only growing so I have to evolve, family can't get along
Balance something that we have to restore and that is something that I can't do alone
That's something that I can't do alone
Yea that's something that I can't do alone
Fly!

[Hook]
I got a lot on my mind, trying to not go insane
I know I got so much pride, don't really like asking for things
Got way too much on the line, people depending on me
At times I feel so confined but I'm gon' have to break free

[Outro]
I got so much on my mind
I know I got so much pride
