[Hook: T'nah Apex]
If you will it, I'mma kill it
Whatcha askin' for, whatcha gon' get
If it's true then close your eyes and feel it
I'm plottin' on upliftin', with my trillion
Is it a go, is it a go
Is it a go, is it a go
Is it a go

[Verse 1: T'nah Apex]
Is it real in me
Just wanna know, wanna see
On the next degree selfie self havin' sit down
Like many compounds
Words and similes assimilate
Mind to fate, assemble 'em late
Them in the dirt face-first
You need to stop actin' up, woman up

[Verse 2: Chelsea Reject]
Ownin' it is I prosper, one time
See my opponent that I conquer, two times
Chelsea been a reject
You so long now, you can't stop her
You imposters, with yo' sponsors
And yo' concerts and yo' encore

[Verse 3: CJ Fly]
Fly!
I been fly like a Concorde
You ain't have to see flow like this
Cause I'm 'bout to drop like Ã¤nchor, I mean a anchor
Cause the Pros got it in the pocket like handkerchiefs
We the new tribe though we ain't gon' chief
In the year we smokin' like rituals
Just wish me well, I'm hopin' that I'm rich and well
Throwin' money like a wishin' well

[Hook: T'nah Apex]
If you will it, I'mma kill it
Whatcha askin' for, whatcha gon' get
If it's true then close your eyes and feel it
Connect the dots, get what I'm feelin', with a trillion
Is it a go, is it a go
Is it a go, is it a go
Is it a go

[Verse 4: CJ Fly]
Won't need a main stream to be flowin' in sync
'Bout to fill the raft water, fill the raft, then you go in the sink
Talkin' loose, thought we would lose, got me tighten
The shit that I might spit won't even stink, still need my Trident
Feelin' real mystic, might need my stick and then I might stick
My fork into my steak, make no mistake, just suppose I dent
That power like Poseidon
Is just the god inside him
They sayin' it's the praise
They raisin' hands when they sing "ahh" hymns
Ahem!

[Verse 5: Chelsea Reject]
I never fly when they aimin'
I was never the type to go and praise them
All I ever really lacked was patience
Just wanted to be free like a mason
Uh, is that the life you're chasin'
I got the heat for the street like cajun
Cause you can never decide, you always stuck in yo' mind
You're so caged in, outrageous
How am I gonna take this
To another location, when the devil soul gazin'
You better hurry cause the episode changin'
I can't take it, and I'm jaded
But I played it, and I made it
They can't kill my vibe, this amazin'
I might testify for the nation

[Verse 6: T'nah Apex]
A balance of things that think
Unsealin' the prophecy
Just want the land
Think I'mma be whatever I'mma have to be
Passin' whole trees
Down the avenue with ton of you walkin' too and straight on through
But the stairs to clean yo' jewels just spit for free
Think I know how much infinity feeds the whole foods God seeds
(Somethin's gotta give, gotta pay
Gotta live 'nother way)
Think I know how much infinity feeds the whole foods God seeds
