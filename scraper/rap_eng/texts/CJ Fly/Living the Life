[Hook]
(Fly!)
People stay thinkin' I'm livin' a lie
You woulda' thought that they would know
Everything ain't gon' be sweet all the time
You woulda' thought that they would know
Can't be that real if you're livin' a lie
You woulda' thought that they would know
As long as my niggas with me I'm alright
(Fly!)

[Verse 1]
No dirty laundry, it's all on the line
Pray that I fall off, but I don't know why
Smile through it all, its a lot on my mind
Sometimes I might lie when I'm asked if I'm fine
Some people be needy, ask for things
They ain't worried 'bout your well being
Put thought in these words, but do they get the meaning?
Saw Kanye recently, but ain't get to meet him
Fuck it

[Bridge]
Life is only what you make it, aye
Me? I'm used to being patient, aye
I could bet that Nyck he know we almost lost our life when we was in the basin, aye
Swear that party it was crazy, aye
Coulda' been the one to [?], aye
I'm just thankful that we made it out
Most them niggas they don't take this route

[Hook]
People stay thinkin' I'm livin' a lie
You woulda' thought that they would know
Everything ain't gon' be sweet all the time
You woulda' thought that they would know
Can't be that real if you're livin' a lie
You woulda' thought that they would know
As long as my niggas with me I'm alright
People stay thinkin' I'm livin' a lie
You woulda' thought that they would know
Everything ain't gon' be sweet all the time
You woulda' thought that they would know
Can't be that real if you're livin' a lie
You woulda' thought that they would know
As long as my niggas with me I'm alright

[Outro]
Some people gon' think
Some people, some people, some people don't think
Some people, some people, some people gon' think
Think, think, think things
Some people don't
You woulda' thought that they would know
