[Hook]
Feeling sentimental, who do I call?
Sober going crazy, what am I on?
Feeling like a fucking ticking time bomb
Type of thoughts I’m thinking have your mind blown
Feeling sentimental, who do I call?
Sober going crazy, what am I on?
Feeling like a fucking ticking time bomb
Type of thoughts I’m thinking have your mind blown

[Verse 1: Dirty Sanchez]
I been a I don't give a F type
Whipping in the F type
Appeal like a pill to an addict
Appeal to the masses
[?]
Appreciate your life while you have it
I've had it but my gun keep jamming
Music so good that my gun keep jamming
None the less my parents getting older, god damn it
Looking for the fountain of youth in the tavern
Why we got nukes if we supposed to be family?
But we can go to war til the last man standing
You can get shot [?] eating pills like candy
Trying to ease the pain
Always rocking Timbs, I'm used to living in the rain
Sipping on that Lil Wayne
Listen to this Pro's pain
I hate to be a downer but that's why I'm on
Plus all my niggas dying, bro I'm tired of the mourning
This is for my dead homies, keep the Henny pouring

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
Telling you I'm down like pulling you on quicksand
Thinking I should do it alone cause I'm a big man
I don't never tell a soul any time I get sad
Once it rock bottom like a plane soon as it hit land
And when I'm getting mad
I tell myself "don't be ungrateful just remember all the times before when shit was bad"
Sometimes you gotta leave the past in the past
Tryna live in the now, you can't get old times back
I swear I be feeling dark, keep the paper [?] so if I ever need a spark
I lost a couple homies and I wish that we could talk
Thinking telling someone else your problems it could be your [?], then again it’s really [?]
So sensitive by everything afflicted by your thoughts
Listen to the words of Jah
I know right now things are making sense
If you got someone, you call your friend and take the time to feel...
