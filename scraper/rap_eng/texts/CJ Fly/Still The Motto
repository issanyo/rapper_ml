[Intro]
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen
I go by the name of, Captain Fly
And my Co-Pilot on this flight today is, Cookin' Soul!
Ya know what I'm sayin, that's that crack music
Cra-cra-crack music, ooouh, Check check

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
As you can see
Do this rap shit with accuracy
Your old dude got his Acura
Seized
Must have not had drive
If you sittin' in the passenger seat
Ain't tryna
Make you baffled, so please
I could have your bath filled with ease
Glasses chilled, champagne spilled kind of accidently
Now we both messed up, can't just leave
So we have to come clean
Truth be told, my tooth go gold, I Midas well be your king
A rubio, whose rubies glows, she might as well be my queen
Memba the Platinium card shards for the silver
You ain't never had the pebbles but you will ma'
Bring you into the conglomerate, its up to you if you rocket
Keep it exposed, whether or not you got cliffs
Take it all while you can, wallet last
Lo horses looking like a maverick
Feeling like Dallas real negus in existence
Soul get holy need a prayer, I spirit with my 6th sense
Don't trust in god then money, you won't get Lent

[Hook: CJ fly]
She know she wanna roll with me (x2)
Ain't ridin' in a stolen Jeep
Ain't ridin' in a stolen V
I'm carrying the O on me (x2)
So I'm just ducking police
Ducking the D's, I say fuck the police
My nigga puff on your weed!

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
I'm tryna be one of the best to do it
So don't you be clueless thinkin that you could just
Maneuver quick this is a movement
My newer shit ain't like manure shit
Went to school with kids, who was cooler with the Hoover Crips
I'm tryna be stupid rich
Have bread and not know what to do with it
Always knew these tricks, what you want from me
The doob or spliff, my boots is Timbs
So I got a little bit of tree up in 'em
It's in my family genes to get it, denim going missing
But if the shorty got the riches, then things might go different
I won't go broke on paying for dates, I break her off, she chipping
Tummy full, least I could do is put my tip in
We get sauced then I dip in, act as her stuffing on thanks giving
Hit them curves, then I be drifting
Energy exerted made her give in
Eye got bags cause lately you've been trippin'
Could see we had a spark and I know we caused friction
All I gotta is good riddance, later

[Hook: CJ Fly]

(Motto never changed, it's still fuck cops!)
