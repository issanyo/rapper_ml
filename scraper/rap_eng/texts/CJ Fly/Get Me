[Intro]
Fly, you've finally made it. We've been expecting you
There's a hunger to be fed, and a void to be filled
But the choice is yours, either you're in, or you're out

Welcome to the flytrap

[Verse 1]
They more focused on what city they can spend a weekend in
And I'm just tryna find my path of spiritual awakenin',            but so be it, Stallin', countin' ruble like a Soviet and gone too lit
Any booty tell me that I won't be shit
Stink twice as Bad keep your two cents
On the floor like your shoes is a New York nigga
That could always tell you where the roaches is
Take you somewhere it ain't great, buildin' seven section 8
Out of their projects thank the state and OBE our best escape man

[Pre-Hook]
If it don't concern me I don't care
My only chance to make things right [?]
Could be trapped in all my life won't be controlling me with fear
The only thing that's on my mind is when we gon' get outta here lord
If it don't concern me I don't care
My only chance to make things right [?]
Could be trapped in all my life won't be controlling me with fear
The only thing that's on my mind is when we gon' get outta here lord

[Hook]
Only thing they worry about is making commas
Way they was sleeping would've thought it was a coma
Got to make up for not having my diploma
Gotta get me some awards to show my mama
Gotta get me some awards to show my mama
Only thing they worry about is making commas
Way they was sleeping would've thought it was a coma
Got to make up for not having my diploma
Gotta get me some awards to show my mama
Gotta get me some awards to show my mama

[Skit: CJ's Mother]
"After spending all my money sendin' you to private school, this is what you decide you gonna do. Play rap music. You droppin' out of college for this? You better make something of yourself. This is what you wanna do? Just make us proud son"

Fly!

[Outro]
I promise you, I think it was worth it all
I promise you, I think it was worth it all
I promise you, I think it was worth it all
I promise you, I think it was worth it all
