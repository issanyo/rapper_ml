Overthinking
A little too much , little too much

Overthinking
Maybe a little too much
Overthinking
Have I lost my touch
Could I still be the one ?

So much time has come
So much time has gone , I’m still here
All those moments in the past
That we’ve made it through, we killed fear
No regrets , never forget
But you must forgive
To forward in pure love
And dash away all the negative
That’s the life I’m trying to live
Life I’m trying to build
Wake up to my goals
And my goal is live, positive
Maybe I’m too comfortable
And maybe I should change a bit
But life is getting dangerous
And I just want your angel wings
In my own zone I’ve been quite
I’ve been vibing
Cause all the voices in my head don’t silence
And they speak of violence
Cause outside is madness
And my conscious is turning monstrous
My soul is trapped in badness
Or maybe I’m just

Overthinking
Maybe a little too much
Overthinking
Have I lost my touch
Could I still be the one ?

Red razor Motorola
N64 controller
300zx my dad would roll up
Back when Trevor cut my hair I had a box cut
Now I’m at MGM Grand with the boxers
Oh how I’ve grown up
I’ve seen a lot from what the cities showed us
Always felt the cities on our shoulders
So we carried it
Any problems buried it
Killed all of my arrogance
Or at least i masked it and Jim Carry’d it
Now I walk around chip on my shoulder
LA sipping corona
Liquor fill the aroma
Rolling up potent Doja
Studio in the basement
Rick introduced us to Skee
And Skee left the keys to the spaceship
And now we off
Riding around hunger paining in that slingshot
Eyes red learning standard, stalling I made it stop
No lights and licensee in Hollywood passing cops
The city is filled with ops but I’m here for the toast and Gauc
Thinking thinking too much my brain is scattered
Reminiscing cause my distance on what really matters
Mind over matter
If you don’t mind it don’t matter
The moments what I’m trying to capture and stop !

Overthinking
Maybe a little too much
Overthinking
Have I lost my touch
Can I still be the one
Overthinking
Maybe a little too much
Overthinking
Have I lost my touch
Can I still be the one
