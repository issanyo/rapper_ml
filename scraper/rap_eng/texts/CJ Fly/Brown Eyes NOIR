[Intro: Mint Condition]
Girl, I wanna hold ya
Your head on my shoulder
With you I'll never tire
We'll take it higher and higher

[Hook]
Whenever you run into
Some things that they say aren't true
Don't forget who you are
Girl, you came way too far
Brown eyes NOIR
Yeah I knew I wanted Brown Eyes
I met her at the function
Met her at the function
Met her at the function
I knew I wanted Brown Eyes
I met her at the function
Met her at the function
Met her at the function

[Verse 1: K. Forest]
Brown eyes noir
So much pressure, you never fold up
See they hated you at first
Until they seen that you glowed up
Now they all wanna be your friend
'Cause your pictures getting likes
And now they wanna hang
But I don't think it's right
But oh well, what can you do?
That's just how some people made
See, they never feel good
Unless someone givin' em praise
Listen girl, I'm not the type too
Dress to impress, I have my days
I'm comfortable wearing sweatsuits and J's
Yeah, let's talk about your dreams, I'm all ears
What's your favourite colour?
Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
Tight Jeans, I love it when you dressing so modest
Natural hair, don't care
That's my West-African Goddess
I ain't got a lot of bread
Substitute it for the bed
Where we could dream instead
Mesmerize 'bout what led us here
I met you at the function, met you at the function
Never thought for a second it was you I'm trusting

[Hook]
Whenever you run into
Some things that they say aren't true
Don't forget who you are
Girl, you came way too far
Brown eyes NOIR
Yeah I knew I wanted Brown Eyes
I met her at the function
Met her at the function
Met her at the function
I knew I wanted Brown Eyes
I met her at the function
Met her at the function
Met her at the function

[Verse 2: CJ Fly, K. Forest]
Now I say what are the odds?
That you wear shades to cover beautiful eyes
Could take you away from home, Wizard of Oz
Girl, you know I am not lyin'
The window still your so open
Swear that I been lookin' right in
Now baby, don't you be frontin'
Don't know bout your spirit, I'll teach you the science
Came in from tourin', I just landed from foreign
No, it ain't time for the talking
'Cause it's early Juvet morning
I just ran into K. Forest
Yo, all the gyaldem look gorgeous
Who you tellin' that notice?
Couple paintings and shorties
Bare tings in NY, no shortage
Like chicks with beauty and brains
Don't gotta be in that order
And looking into yourself
Is what I want you to do more of
Fly!

I met her at the function
Met her at the function
Met her at the function
I knew I wanted Brown Eyes
I met her at the function
Met her at the function
