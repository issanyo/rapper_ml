[Intro: Dessy Hinds]
Yeah, turn it up, turn it up right
Turn it up, turn it up uh
Turn it up, turn it up word
Word, word
This that soulful shit, word
This that soulful shit uh
Check, check

[Verse 1: Dessy Hinds]
Ain’t no felicity for toying out the specimens
Joint skeletons with no joint that skeleton's
Could skill his ten out of the pen
Can’t fence vents with a stop on the ink
Best thinking when this drops and it sinks
And the sense tips
Defenseless when I vent this
Because you had the right amounts to sense this
The right amount descendants
Ambition turns ambidextrous
Thoughts of a black male riding in a badmon new Lexus
Complex intellects move in a Lex too
With a tec too, it only teck two shots to let thru
And project proof of an iller nigga let loose
From the vet’s room cause no pet zoos could let him loose
Began the roots with a few trees
How many mics did ya’ll really rip before the Fugees?
With a few needs from the help of a few emcee’s
And then the end seize, with a AK-47 and the pen bleeds...

[Verse 2: Chelsea Reject]
Yo
Devise a thesis where I’m seated on the throne
Mama asking me questions sometimes I wish I had my own
Globe
Except for with college she like
‘Oh, no. Where you gon’ go?’
Ima try a different route with a whole different elation
Enjoying life with admiration for all the world’s creations
But looking back at the past is the reason you can’t save it
Live your life to the fullest and have some patience for all your aspirations
They saying I’m Godly like golly
Never saw a future with this rapping so it’s Ali
Messing with my mind, soul, and body
Bars fire like Kamikazi
You can’t stop me
I do this at my leisure
Ya’ll just a finger painting compared to a Mona Lisa
Never see defeat like a podiatrist cause eye exist
And I insist
I bet you can relate
It’s just these fumes humans consuming
Boosting the crime rate like wait

[Verse 3: T’Nah Apex]
I close my eyes in lotus
Feeling the whole unfolding
Mhm mmm mmm mmm
Untighten and twist it
I’m gonna resist it
Mhm mmm mmm mm mm
I know my light has come
I’m messing with the spell
Learning my real language well
If each one would teach one
We would come prevail
And no apologies to tell
On each other we could go ahead and bail
In history as it seem we never fail
How do I get down to get it
How do I let em know it’s real
Get thee originals and fuck the spiel
Apparently too real to reveal
What an invert
Such a slim introvert
Chatter clutters in my whole brain
Then I get nice not to hurt feelings
Sometimes
And it never works it holds me back and rewind
Only moving forward toward Zion tryna well inform

[Verse 4: CJ Fly]
It’s a heist
I think it’s safe to say that I’m the highest
Always savior the highs
Say au re·voir and say goodbyes
Keep your guard up
Only one that can save you is Christ
Praying he hears your cries
Shredding paper on sight
With not a tear in my eye, goddamn
I gotta live like the God that I am
Heard cleanliness is next to godliness and
I decided to start sweeping the competition
We get it in, we getting it
You take the loss, we don’t ask when
Might hit a lick, on your loft
But only if you choose to get large
Have your chest gone like you been smoking them menthols
I’m mental
When I said I was taking it I meant all, been sharp
Some sort of deadly my thoughts been edgy I went off
And flow like arteries cause my artillery is heavy
Ain’t know it was art 'til they read every line why
They can’t see me
When I spit like a semi cause it’s
Over heads when I let it
Fly
Would it hurts we know sometimes
I barely even try
Can’t judge like we on court
Or even in a trial
Open up and chose to vent too late
Get a breath of fresh air as the space ventilates
Saw that they felt a way
As we wait
It felt like my shoulders gained some extra weight
And then, I realized that this ain’t too great
People start acting fake the trust disintegrates
Think it’s time to escape, thoughts of saving the day
Like the man in the “S” cape
My opportunity it came
Tricks of the trade
As I decided to skate
