Yeah yeah yeah
Look what 24 years done built
Realest nigga never ever need no milk
Came from the house where the dealers delt
Always got to flood the streets we can see no drought
Never that * x 24

Devontée *
30 like curry I’m not talking Seth
I’m not talking Steph, I’m talking Dell
I am the originator been a woe working on excellence
I don’t care about these tings in the VIP
Only here just to get me a grip
These dimes like my diamonds I make em both drip
Turn dummy to dupi I make em all dip

CJ Fly*
Cemetery right next to my crib
Honestly this the best place to live
Sometimes make me think about death
Smoke rituals to pay my respect
Love thy neighbours but my neighbours are dead
Get me vex then you might be next
To em laying in a fresh flower bed
Free willy put a hole in his head

Devontée *
Honestly doggy I feel you
All for the gwalla they squaking and squeaking
If they beaking we beefing they bleeding they leaking we leave them where no one can see them
Honestly doggy I feel you
If they preeing they plotting to kill you
They keeping they tabs to bill you
I just keep building cause time reveal you

Look what 24 years done built
Realest nigga never ever need no milk
Came from the house where the dealers delt
Always got to flood the streets we can see no drought
Never that * x 24

Never that
Tell the selecta to level that
I don’t take breaks I don’t pedal back
One of mines all of yours how I settle that
I meant what I said when I said all that
All the chit chat I ain’t into that
I’m the same man in real life and the internet
For the low that’s what I get it at
For the high that’s what I ship it at
Gimme dat
I’m rinsing dat
A hot boy I can’t simmer man
Nina sing sinner man
Not Simone but she hot like cinnamon
Smoking a pack no cigarette
She want to chew me like Nicorette
She say she never seen a nigga bigger yet
But mi nah into that
You take me for a idiot ?

Look what 24 years done built
