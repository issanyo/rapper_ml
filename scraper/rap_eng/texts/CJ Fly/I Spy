[Verse 1: King Draft]
I see more in you, city full of warriors
We stuck in a oracle, I'm thinking 'bout balling
I'm tryna find a way, I've been accepting my calling
God gave me hands to help you up when you falling
On God, niggas is warring, court cases and warrants
Children basketball jerseys with [?]
Thought life was a cycle before I stepped in the cypher
Drug the kids up because they too hyper
Everybody think it's weird when you tryna live righteous
Like a Thriller video, these walking bodies is lifeless
When ya mother crying it's hard to give a fuck about science
Queens city, fell asleep to the sirens, I think we bigger though
Yo
Them school halls was different, them school balls was crippin'
But they ain't figaro or figure out in reversing the trigger so
[?] should be that you holding yo nigga close
No I never in forever but it don't mean that that nigga won't but
I think we smarter
Tryna live longer, save our sons and daughters
And it's hard to keep your cool when you living in a sauna
Bitch I see the bigger picture

[Chorus: King Draft and CJ Fly (4x)]
I spy with my eye what you gon' be
What you gon' reach, you'll be a star
You gon' see

[Verse 2: King Draft]
I see you in me
Pray to whatever God that I don't hear your eulogy
Forgive me if I slip, this experience new to me
Make me wanna be better, can't explain what you do to me
It's crazy 'cause usually
I just see yo face and every day it looks new to me
Every day I get better, ten times better for you and me
And yo mama calm and confident a star you would be
And I can say the same, you remind me of newer me
I remember days where temptation would lure me
But now I got you with me, losing you is like losing me
I can tell you're watching, when I'm near you're like glue to me
Your smile is contagious and your teeth like achoo to me
Tryna be twice the man since you're here it's like two of me
You give me purpose on days I ain't know what to do with me
I pray that if your mother ever catches the flu in me
I don't excuse the man that I still expect you to be
And always spread love, there's happiness [?]
And be a quick learner 'cause ain't no life in no truancy
You can see the world, to yourself still true you be
A king in no time

[Chorus: King Draft and CJ Fly (4x)]
I spy with my eye what you gon' be
What you gon' reach, you'll be a star
You gon' see

[Verse 3: CJ Fly]
I seen it all from a young age
I found a hammer in my house, the streets exposed me to the gunplay
I barely went to church on Sundays
It's crazy how the tables turn, you can't be fucking up the feng shui
It's all in alignment, fly towards the horizon
Couldn't pick a better moment, that's called perfect timing
I won't say we wasn't rich but we sure was surviving
I wasn't spoiled but I make do with the tools I'm provided
Shit was rough when the recession hit
Memories blurry I was just a kid, hungry needed extra bread
Learned about pride when I was told I was to never beg
Used to always dream of fucking Pamela And' and wet the bed
I was distracted and pussy all I focused on
Thankful for the positives and not the shit that's going wrong
Cut some people off, I had to remove those that don't belong
Our time is coming just be patient 'cause it won't be long

[Chorus: King Draft and CJ Fly (4x)]
I spy with my eye what you gon' be
What you gon' reach, you'll be a star
You gon' see
