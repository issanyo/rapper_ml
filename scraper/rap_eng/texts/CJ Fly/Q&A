[Verse 1]
I see you in the picture not because you photogenic, I said it
No other chick can fuck with your aesthetic, we beggin'
For a segment, I just think that it's pathetic
I kid, we can get it, no pretendin'
Something come between us, it can happen if you let it
Like [?] we control it, playing tennis
We can be self-centered, whenever, it's whatever
Just don't ask why your organs feelin' like they bein' touched
Shorty really being afraid I cheat, but she got fear in me
That another side of me that she a-scared to see
After my lips, her favorite thing my chin, hair, and teeth
Let me know when you got time to spend for free
Watch this as the clock tick, I realize how much you got thick
Killin' the scene, where is the Oscar?
Someone call the cops up
Tell 'em they might need the [?] cause it could be toxic
This thick skin hot, guess we're tenderloin
I'm makin' her sweat and I'm makin' her moist
Get a hotel room that's vacant, your choice
Never got dismantled, she got destroyed
Ain't tryin' to make you know me but myself is bein' deployed
I do my job well while you make me wanna ploy
You a warrior, my man, you the type she avoid
Love my music, but she couldn't match my age with the voice

[Hook]
I said ladies put your hands up
I pour my heart inside these stanzas
What can I say? My sign's a cancer
Got some questions to ask her
And I just hope she answers
(x2)

Put you close to me
This is how we s'posed to be
Listen to some Jodeci
Then fuck all night then go to sleep
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Whenever you're around I forget how to talk
On my mind so much can't get you out my thoughts
Now they sayin' a transplant, I still have your heart
You might've crossed the line when I said "Don't start"
Disqualification, it's all triggered now cause you flow in my mind like [?]
You got me floatin, I was hoping later raw-baby-dog you and Fly could do some pollination
I swear I've seen it all based on experience
Marriage is a life sentence, plus a period
Sick thoughts live alone, but I care and this
[?] I'll get us one
Yea, maybe cop some drinks or five
Baby girl, relax your mind
You're looking so fine
Let me see your thighs, girl

[Hook]
