Yeah
Yeah

[Intro]
Know I waited my whole life for this moment
Swear I waited my whole life for this moment

[Verse 1]
Uh, border to border heading to Toronto
They got me cornered, got no where to run to
Kick a flow, go toe to toe if you want to
And shit but a [?] if they know I'm the one too
Just met a chica, felo in abundance
Just so you know call me chulo and play with my pelo while I bun this
Hold up, amusing that you haven't gone to the MoMA
Swear it's genetics, came off from my momma
Throw it at me, won't get caught in a moment
Can't miss my flight, I got called in the mornin'
My buzz like a hornet
I know that you horny
It's not like I'm wanted
Don't want to be hunted
Always on point so I won't be a target
Cause cops killing black kids and then they just walkin'

[Outro] (3x)
Know I'll get it by how badly I want it
Know all them bitches is mad cause they fronted
Left [?] itching, hope I get some money
Swear I waited my whole life for this moment
