[Intro]
La la
La, la la la
La, la la
La, la la la, la
Fuck up my day
Nothing could fuck up my day at all
Fuck up my day
Nothing can fuck up my day at all

[Verse]
I know me with a cloud over my head what they would love to see
Resilient to the bullshit, don't think anything can fuck with me
My grandma should be able to be ageing a little comfortably
And I'm just looking out for them cause they were looking out for me
Supported me from jump and said there's nothing I could not achieve
I made it out of nothing right in front should call it alchemy
We looking for results not understanding what the outcome means
Something is wrong internally, that's if you got it out for me

[Outro]
Fuck up my day
Nothing could fuck up my day at all
Fuck up my day
Nothing could fuck up my day at all
Fuck up my day
Nothing could fuck up my day at all
Fuck up my day
Nothing could fuck up my day at all
Fuck up my day
Nothing could fuck up my day at all
Fuck up my day
Nothing could fuck up my day at all
Fuck up my day
Nothing could fuck up my day at all
Fuck up my day
Nothing could fuck up my day at all
