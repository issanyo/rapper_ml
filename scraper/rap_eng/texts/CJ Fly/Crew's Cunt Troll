Part 1

[Verse 1]
She blow like a gun at the track meet
Tell her run with the wind
Told me she gotta make a call
So I go fuck with her friend
Up in her ribs
Didn't know that I was fuckin' with twins
Weeks later she hit me up and said "Link up at the crib"
I jump in the Benz
I'm driving this shit
Opened the door barely got in
She gave me head we ended up in the bed
I told her strip and told her let me get in
I hit it again; I swear man I be doin' my thing
Before I can blink twice, her cellphone starts to ring
Her man called to let her know he found out 'bout the fling
From a wierd ass number like he fuck with the Feds
Fuck if you fed, you mad cause I'm up in your chick, PRICK!

[Interlude (Boyfriend on the phone)]
"Tell him that's it, I'm bringing my clips
And know that I'm gon' aim at his hip
Next to his limbs, then up to his lip
Until his blood starts to drip
When I buck him and dip
So what the fuck did he think?"

[Verse 2]
I told him, "Fuck you I'm about to bust in your chick"
I let one off quick, put my clothes on and jumped in the whip
Shook her up till she told me where the fuck does he live
Rolled me a spliff, I puff a few hits then I tuck in the grip
I'm laughin like something funny and shit
Saw his friends, then I told em' that I want his head, and wanted him dead
Then told em' "gimme the loot" they came up with some bread
Now sit and enjoy your day as I head to the bank
On the way home, I seen the nigga picking up meds
Cocksucker saw me and looked like he was pissin' his pants
I let go two, he hit the roof, I'm ready to rip him to shreds
About to kill him, tried to jump buildings, put some shit in his leg
Was stuck on the edge
My trigger finger itchin, life has come to an end
Caught slipping as he hung from the ledge
I bet he wish he could have done something productive instead
I said "Wassup now mothafucka, dummy you dead!"

[Verse 3]
Bitches they throw at me, then I start catching mad feels
I'm mad chill, we fuckin' and I throw on the mag shield
I get rock, we get stoned, and she get that ass drilled
I got her running out like she just took her last pill
I sit higher than mountains when I'm showing these cats skills
Make a bad deal, gon' be you last meal, if the gat's steel
A beast yet to be tamed, I'm suggesting that you stay back
You'll be living in color, black and blue cause' homie don't play that
All my women got racks and they stay strapped
Don't wanna relax then say smack
Then they gon' have to lay back
And then things fade to black when you takin' nap
Wishing you could take it back but its too late for that
