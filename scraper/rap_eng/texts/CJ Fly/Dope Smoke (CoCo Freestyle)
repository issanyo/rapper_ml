[Intro]
Fly!

[Hook]
I'm in love with the dope smoke
In Love with the dope smoke
I'm in love with the dope smoke
In Love with the dope smoke

[Verse 1]
Just like the Olympics I got more than four O's
All that happened, now I need a four door
Just so I got space to fit in more pros
Fans run up to me like "Fly, I need a photo"
You still sleepin' on the floor, well you a hobo
Always catch me puffin' some Old Chron
Joey, I will come and soon get off my homie groin
Think it's time that I just use my own flow
I been poppin'
I don't fuck with beans and plus I ain't cofee
It can't be no good weed if I ain't coughing
Put it in the 'wood like I'm buying coffins
That section 8 buildin' right by the projects
Niggas frontin' when they say that they got my project
I fuck with you if you came and bought a copy
Heard I did a P-mix, now they buy they copy
Quitting not an option
You can try and stop it

[Bridge]
Get rolled over like a bulldozer
Never sober, never fully sober
Takin' over, yeah we takin over
I'm replacin Hova and replacing Hova

[Verse 2]
My flow is nasty might need a maid
Could get hit by a qurter like ?
?
They want somebody to follow our leader with
Just about two boys, two pounds with a liter ?
But either way, nowadays a music need a message
And a baby singing, they don't even get it
Like a student teacher, they don't give me credit
You ain't go to calsses, you won't even get it
On a bad path, they might need directions
Maybe they just needed detention, they needed attention
They did mary jane and I can't be ? because...

[Hook]
I'm in love with the dope smoke
In Love with the dope smoke
I'm in love with the dope smoke
In Love with the dope smoke

[Outro]
Marijuana
You done run out of marijuana
You done run out of marijuana
