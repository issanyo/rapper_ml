[Intro]
You niggas got me fucked up
You niggas got it fucked up
You niggas got it fucked up
Fly!

[Verse 1]
Eyes all red it don't matter though
Kitty catapult put a cat on pole
Had defense but never guard the ho
Ain't it green still eatin' at your artichoke
Drivin' the whips that you outta know
Lately I've been feeling like I'm on a roll
And the whitties that be with me they ain't on ya bowl
Plus the pot that I got it ain't on ya stove
And it ain't in ya kitchen
Mind state of a kingpin and I'm making a killin'
Though I'm makin' a livin'
Turn keys to my city so it's thanks that I'm givin'
Younger guys say I'm driven
I could pass in the class ain't the tassels decision
Bunch of niggas with me like a civil rights sit in
I'm great with advice but just bad with decisions

[Hook 1]
Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done
Gotta make myself my own plate
There ain't a task I had that I ain't never complete
And I'm doin' pretty good so who am I to complain
That's why I'm sayin'
Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done
Gotta make myself my own plate
There ain't a task I had that I ain't never complete
And I'm doin' pretty good so who am I to complain
That's why I'm sayin'

[Break]
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, G-g-g-g
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, G-g-g-g
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, G-g-g-g
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, G-g-g-g

[Beat Change]
G-g-g-g, G-g-g-g
G-g-g-g, G-g-g-g (Fly!)
G-g-g-g

[Hook 2: Devontée]
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
My hood holdin' me to get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
My hood holdin' me to get it done

[Verse 2: Devontée]
I had to get me some
Ballin' out like ESPN
Timb's tan like they was in the sun
With my woes we'll never run, no
You could tell I'm gone
Remember when I had a telus phone
Text message say my minutes done
Tell em all they can't tell us nothin' no mo'
Now my plan's unlimited, tryna get my grands unlimited
I gotta peel off of livin' this
So ya'll know what my limit is
All I need is some dividends
Woah!
So my mind like a militant
I know the plug fuck the middle man
Got 'Bare Tings' and they know I ain't a middle man
They know I get it done and I get it in
Woah!

[Outro]
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
Get it done, Get it done, Get it done, Get it done
