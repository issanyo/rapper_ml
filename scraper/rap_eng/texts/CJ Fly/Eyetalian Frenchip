[Intro]
"What people? What are you talking about? What's on you're mind?"
"I met this girl"
"Yeah So..?"
"I like her and everything but.."
"The only thing that matters is
What's good for you and how
You feel about each other
Let me tell you something
When you're alone late at night
In bed just you and her under the covers
That's all that matters see..
You gotta do what your heart tells you to do."

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Was one of the happiest fellas when I first met Bella
We started off as just friends
Then exchanged love letters
Became best friends
And figured there was no one better
I told her we was gon' be homies forever..
You're not the type that i would often meet
You're from the magazines, not off the street
Feelin like a man whe she would walk with me
Her momma's a lawyer, her daddy a cop
Got another chick on the side but I ain't
Scared of her pops, she don't talk about her family a lot
When I'm with her she loves to stare at the watch, i connected the dots
Third eye squinting cause I'm trying to see things through
Figured out what we gon' do, I'm kind of hungry let's go eat some food
To Little Italy her family spot
I'm trying to change my diet so I won't be having alot
An older head said â€˜when you go, to sit facing the door
So you can gaze at the floor in case he break in the wall'
We walked in, they sat us down pronto, had a short convo
And even I know, not to hurt my Italiano
She told me get her a drink and be ready for this
I said what, her dad popped up and started asking bout a wedding (shit)
Said "let me know when I got a reverend friend, its either you get her a ring or we get in the ring"
Her brother asked me if I wanted a slice
I said that one would be nice
I said that hoping he ain't came with his knife

I'm in a love triangle
How did I get into this love triangle
Love triangle
Fuck it don't give a shit I'm infamous for having chicks

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
I got this freaky chick from France
She love to get in my pants
I guess I'm the man, got two chicks and don't give a damn
But see,really mean more, that's why she mi amore
She the type of chick you would sport
I call her Eda for short
She don't need diamonds but I always keep her shining for sure
Couldn't maintain a job cause she got fired before
And I don't blame her
She did some crazy things she ain't ashamed of
Told her I'd hire all I ask is be straight up
Now things got greater, a job well done is in my MO
Goes into foul play, she told me keep it in MO
Try to protect me if someone tries taking my life
And I love her to death I guess that make her my wife
Ride or die, if there's a problem she getting involved
Only work for me so when the times right I let her off
Like any boss, I speak my piece before I let her talk
Whenever we get home then I'm regularly calm
If Fly lying, then fly lioness in the bed
She rest in my arms, sometimes on my chest
We share a pillow, whenever she aligned on my head
A little dirty mouth on her every time she speak French
