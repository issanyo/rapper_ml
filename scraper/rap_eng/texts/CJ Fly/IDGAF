[Intro]
Fly in the night that's a red eye flight

[Hook]
I done gave a fuck for too long
I done gave a fuck for too long
I done gave a fuck for too long
Screw y'all, y'all done gave a motherfucker blue balls
I done gave a fuck for too long
I done gave a fuck for too long
I done gave a fuck for too long
Screw y'all, y'all done gave a motherfucker blue balls

[Verse 1]
If you could tell me why they hatin'
I ain't talkin' bout a statement
But I'm takin' rappers out like a permanent remover
I've concluded I done gave a fuck for a bit too long
You niggas think I'm nuts, when I bust it's like screw ya'll
Must be gettin' richer my lil palms just keep on itchin' so much
I could probably go and scratch myself a new pond
While my lines and verses they've been soundin' like the new songs
Askin' "What's next?" they just wanna hear a new song
Ain't no filter on me doe you broken roll with crutches
While I'm rollin' with the punches
It's the only way that you roll
I been on a rap tour, you down to sort that you raw
She think that I'm marryin' her
When I swim in some woman I be yelling out hoorah
Soldiers got deployed and I just went AWOL
Whole lot of baggage imma rent you a U-Haul
I can't deal with bitches I ain't tryna' burn no bridges
I just wish you would get over me and one day really move on
Take it to the dome I'ma do me no approval
You tryna' do numbers then I'ma Pro too cold
Bout to crush all things I'm bouta' get real crucial
Floatin' and I'm flowin' like a motherfuckin' cruise show
You don't got a quarter of the talent that my crew show
If you niggas don't like me better know the feelings mutual
Ya'll amusing I'ma get a muzzle just to mute ya'll
Crudest vocals in the game I'm a modern day Lou Rawl(s)

[Hook]
I done gave a fuck for too long
I done gave a fuck for too long
I done gave a fuck for too long
Screw ya'll, ya'll done gave a motherfucker blue balls
I done gave a fuck for too long
I done gave a fuck for too long
I done gave a fuck for too long
Screw ya'll, ya'll done gave a motherfucker blue balls

[Outro]
Can a nigga get off? Can a nigga get off?
Can a nigga get off?
Off?
Can a nigga get off? Can a nigga get off?
Can a nigga get off? Can a nigga get off?
Off?
Can a nigga get off?
