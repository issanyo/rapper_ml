[Verse 1]
Give it my all until there's no more left
Till the death I won't stop until they know I'm the best
And I ain't waiting my turn cause I'm gone take what I've earned
Fly like the early bird catching the worm, that's what I happened to learn
Sometimes I'm terrified when I should just feel terrific
And the teary eyed tear a cry wanna rip it
Just my imagination a figment of justifiction
Only ask for so much my descriptions are so specific
Of the things that I inspire in life
When I start running my mouth I'm exercising my rights
At times wish I wasn't too busy to kiss my mama goodnight
Cause she's a queen, and me I'm just an honourable knight
That's how I feel but I won't let it show
Double knot on me, cause she's my mother call her to let her know
Our parents was just guarding us but they still let us grow
The bread they gave me kinda spoiled me but still let me mold

[Hook] (x4)
Head in the clouds with my feet on the ground
View from the top and ain't afraid to look down
In my emotions you can see how it sounds
I been a Pro so my work is profound

[Hook]
Do it for the love (x3)
Won't sacrifice it all just to ball for the bottles of bub and the broads in the club
Really passionate inside, do have fun while I'm at it so what cause we all having fun
I know the day gonna come where a buster might say that I'm nuts but I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2]
Kill shit then I cremate
Get respect when it's earned start winning but your team ain't
Till the lesson get learned in this game with my team-mates
Should take it serious when we play it
Stood up strong in the weekend
Funschway if the tables get turned
Ripping these shows, when we on tour
Picking up the pieces where we once left off
So ill, they get me in a war
So ill, I should begin a war
Whole squad now the drill can't get beaten in the war
Magnificent magnetics now we gravitate towards
And never had to take to words, thanks to gravity I'm up
The bong ? but I'm glad that I'm above
That's my worry in the world
Try to live my life without a worry in the world
Fly in the sky in the clouds must disperse
Orbiting space and the stars say ya first
Spitting that heat make the sun do a verse
Walking the street make the cars have to swerve
Dogs when they see him they bark ?
Oh it's just my imagination
I admit this is a lot to take in
Won't be another year wasted
When the crown's for the taking
And me I play my role for the taken

[Hook]

Ain't an alcoholic but I see it how I call it
?
Players getting sauddered when the players getting sawed up
?
Stood in winter before we make em' freeze
We leave and they falling get autumn
All day, pardon, certain things I just don't want to part in
Could never have a good time
Solved it with the ?
Learned that balance is key
?
Trying to get my point across
Get myself on the grid
Now my ex when she asks us why
You know that I'm fly like Clark Kent
I can kick a flow you clarks can't
Try to sell me lies I ain't buying it
It's an ? product of our environment
Mary Jane sticking to me cause it's Spider Man
Always felt out of place to go buy my grams
Keep the peace and stop violence
Till the fat lady sings with the violins
They ain't a rival clique
Leave if you trying to live
Have you dead on arrival quick
Gonna need a revival kit
We ill like some viruses
Quarantine cause ain't nobody can find this sick
When my dad got inside a net, he proved just what a viral is

[Hook]
