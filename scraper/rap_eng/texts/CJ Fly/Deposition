[Intro]
Check it out
Check it, check it out
Check it out
Check it, check it out
Check it out
Check it, check it out
Check it out
Check it, check it out

[Hook]
I'd imagine he was doing things that made you bored
He ain't giving you enough, then I could give you more
Likely to show you some things that would leave you in awe
I could bet he never made you feel this way before

[Verse 1]
My cougar call me a Millennial
I guess that's true, I just ain't ever know
She claim she only like to give me head
I think she like sucking dick in general
Your job got you stuck at work, work, work
Squeeze me in your busy schedule
What time you get off, what's the word, word, word
Get buzzed, then bust like we were letting go
Your inner-freak, you gotta let her show
I put that pussy on a pedestal
Love when you ride it like a bicycle
Legs shaking like you tryna pedal still
In your guts won't say it hurt, hurt, hurt
Scream for God like we in church, church, church
Hate it when I'm coming first, first, first
Out of rubbers, damn what's worse, worse, worse
If I can't get inside, it's time for sixty-nine
Show you a different side, you ain't saying shit now
Just like it was lunchtime, you tell me quit the noise
Girl when you done with me
You'll be in love with me

[Hook]
I'd imagine he was doing things that made you bored

[Verse 2]
Deposit in the pussy, this my deposition
You know you love it when I put your ass in that position
Screaming, you can't resist it
So good, might tell your sister
Might make your friends fight over me, got no time for the mix-up
Fuck you like we was making babies, condoms for prevention
Magnums keep me protected
Though I ain't being defensive
What you get is what it is
So I'm not being pretentious
Swear our sex is electric, connect to my extension
Just in new development
Went deeper than I've ever been
I'm drilling 'til I make a bigger hole
Could do this shit all day
It's dark in here just like a cave
Hit the walls like I was lookin' for some gold
From pebbles to some sediments
Know everything I said I meant
Would think that I was tryna reach the core
Consider this like medicine
Injection I put my dick in
You ill and I'll provide you with the cure

[Hook]
I'd imagine he was doing things that made you bored
He ain't giving you enough, then I could give you more
