[Intro]
Know diamonds form from pressure
But don't be so hard on yourself
Know diamonds form from pressure
But don't be so hard on yourself

[Verse]
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, just keep shinin'
Show them how bright you are even if it blinds 'em
If you like to dance depending on the lighting
Some people see you and they get so excited
Make this one for all the miners
In a dark place, where you might just find us
Made it out and we're the few survivors
One of them once [?] their desires
What I learned it made me wiser
'Cause we been tough
Lose a lot as soon as we get cut
You know where we came from, it was rough
Hard differentiating what is love
Don't feel no way if someone try to pick you up
Resilient even when they give you funny looks
Got a [?] like some cuffs
Steal from you 'cause that's the shit that money does
Don't let your dreams get crushed

[Hook]
Know diamonds form from pressure
But don't be so hard on yourself
Know diamonds form from pressure
But don't be so hard on yourself
Know diamonds form from pressure
But don't be so hard on yourself
Know diamonds form from pressure
But don't be so hard on yourself

[Outro]
You keep on shining, you keep on shining
You keep on shining, 'cause you are a diamond
You keep on shining, you keep on shining
You keep on shining, 'cause you are a diamond
You keep on shining, you keep on shining
You keep on shining, 'cause you are a diamond
You keep on shining, you keep on shining
You keep on shining, 'cause you are a diamond
