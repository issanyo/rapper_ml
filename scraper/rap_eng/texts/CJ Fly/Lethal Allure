[Hook: CJ Fly]
Beat it out the framing it may leave you with a wobble, girl
Crash right at my crib with those emotions that you bottle up
What I give you may kill you but you gotta know
It may feel like heaven understand it if you gotta go

[Verse: CJ Fly]
If I'm thinking with my dick before I hit put on a thinking cap
We both know you gotta ride but I still think that you should take a cab
You gon' really feel the fingers when I'm in it ain't no faking that
Gonna have you discombobulated so I point you and attack
Ain't a surgeon but I'm workin' on your body
Fuck the talkin' girl you know that I'm about it
Let me get myself behind you like the Heimlich
Cut the PG now it's time to get erotic
She can drink I'm only fucking with the chronic
Know she lovin' party favors and narcotics
Ain't been trifilin' but she swear that she don't mind it
Said she love it when I sing in such harmonics
So

[Hook: CJ Fly]
Beat it out the framing it may leave you with a wobble, girl
Crash right at my crib with those emotions that you bottled up
What I give you may kill you but you gotta know
It may feel like heaven understand it if you gotta go
Beat it out the framing it may leave you with a wobble, girl
Crash right at my crib with those emotions that you bottle up
What I give you may kill you but you gotta know
It may feel like heaven understand it if you gotta go

[Bridge: CJ Fly & Eryn Allen Kane]
Got what you need, got what you need
Got what you need, got what you need
Got what you need, got what you need
Got what you need, got what you need

[Outro: CJ Fly & Eryn Allen Kane]
Lethal allure, lethal allure
Lethal allure, lethal allure
Lethal allure, lethal allure
Lethal allure, lethal allure
