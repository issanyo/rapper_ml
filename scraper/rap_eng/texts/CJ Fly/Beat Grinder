[Intro: Chuck Strangers]
Uh, it's Chuck, what the fuck ?
Alright here it go, it's Chuck
Actually I won't even rap on this shit
I ain't even produce this shit neither, This is Doom's shit
Fuck ya bro, fuck ya'll nigga. Ya'll ain't even take one of my beats and shit
CJ on this shit. That horny ass nigga STEEZ. (No Homo Though)
Fuck ya cardigan wearing niggas. P.E. Nigga
Thought I was done talking shit, huh? Thought I was done, huh?
Naw, hold up
CJ get em!

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Ready set go, you run the tech blow
This the threshold to let those vets know
A few old cats being let go
Taking bitches for just strolls
Haven't been having fun in heaven
When de mon ask if you down say "hell no"
Immortals that just grown
Don't get old We get stoned
And spit it like chest colds from the get go
Wake up yawn, it's the break of dawn
Pass the raw tray to break up on
Wanna cop, I'll make the call
Breaking laws when we blaze the bong
Face it doll, put your make-up on
She got curves but ain't in shape at all
Been in the cut, never lick her in the cunt
Rolling up and dick her, to disable my limiter
Use telepathy to tell a bee he don't fly as well as me
Been with at least seven teens ever since the age of 17
Women definitely, but no I don't have no STDs
Must've been a dream if she seen me with a wedding ring
Left my name out but I don't let the bloggers get to me
As long as I still see my face on MTV
Pro Era, we the next MCs, that's complexing things
F'n up the game, where's the referee, Get em' STEEZ

[Verse 2: Capital STEEZ]
Look they got it misconstrued, the illest dude
First day up on the yard and he's already trying to steal your food
And ima keep fly until I'm finish
A lion in his kingdom, y'all lying in your sentences
So he's more so a brave heart
Sick with the flow now I'm schooling all these great sharks
At the same time finding myself
If it's desire for the belt or just the power and wealth, well fuck it
I'm taking the power combo
Label em' John Doe, now my broads looks like monroe
Pro, you need to simmer down
Instead of getting loud, I'm over heads like thinking clouds
Illest sound killing in the inner city crowd
We on the throne and you Simba now
Look, matter of time and my clock is ticking
I'm still kicking until I got a pot to piss in
