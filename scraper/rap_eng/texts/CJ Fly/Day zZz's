[Verse 1]
Alarm going off, fuck, my dad he would call up
To make sure that I make it to the system we gon' learn
Gotta move the car first, ticket written, wrong description, well I thank you, dear officer
Don't gotta take withdrawals from my accounts that are off-shore
Check, check

For work mom would departure, this would be the part, yuh
Supposed to just walk her, to make sure it's all good
Like an elder I held her down like she needed a walker
Get to bruisin', just in case some crazy dudes try'na stalk her
Taking things a tad bit far, for lies and truth is deep
Just to straighten me out, the irony of ironing
I'm sure there wasn't any crease, in the street the crime increase
In the coast where there are beasts, rotten apple NYC
Knew I was my father's seed, that ain't fall too far from tree
I plan to grow, so I will put water on me before I leave
And get slower, just the flow when I rose from the pot
Used to get in twined with time, I might be late I might just not
Wouldn't know if my grade declined, if I didn't get a drop
No bull, might have to bear with me, value company I got
March in tardy, learned by margin, next semester I took stock
Things were different, 'bout my business, from then I would always plot
I was never seen shootin', the end like the takeover
Somewhere down the line they give me credit, gettin' closer to the closer
I grew older, inches a lil' plus
Introduced to Henny and soda
Flu glasses and champagne drinkin' mimosas
Wasn't gonna take shots yet I holster
It's sad to say I'm a product of what I'm exposed to
Went from, "Mama, au revoir" to, "Mama, I'm tired"
Dawned to feel caught up, so I likely yawn
My day, it was long, patience, it was saught
I could use a quad, think I'm 'bout to make that call
Waitin' for him, I get bored
He like, "Yo I'm on your porch"
Comin' soon so say no more, see here it's all yours
Don't have to ask him if it's cut, he dropped the tree
Rationalized with the spliff, as I face reality I finish this fatality
