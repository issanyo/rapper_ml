[Hook]
Bottle service on the plane how I'm raising the bar
Think it's high jumping, we play how I'm raising the bar
Flexing 'til I bust a vein how I'm raising the bar
You'd think that this shit is a game how I'm raising the bar

[Verse]
'Bout to take the game by storm
Waiting for our reign to start
Don't get gassed you ain't a star
Really more just like a thought
You just looked that way for fun
Stay pulling strings, I don't use a guitar
They look up to me, didn't know that I'm tall
New work so big I could use a U-Haul
Heard your new shit, didn't move me at all
Trapped in your house and you need to get out of it
I'm here to show y'all the difference between counterfeit
They be like "Pro Era, damn y'all demolished it"
Can shop at our show like we the mall and shit
All out here like we the Molly Kids
My generation, we the Molly Kids
You trying to hard, need to call it quits
You be with them jokers like harlequin
The ones who oppose is who I'm against
They think like us, well we opposites
Who better than us? Hold on I'ma guess

[Hook]
Bottle service on the plane now I'm raising the bar
Think it's high jumping, we play hard I'm raising the bar
Flexing 'til I bust a vein now I'm raising the bar
You'd think that this shit is a game how I'm raising the bar
Bottle service on the plane now I'm raising the bar
Think it's high jumping, we play hard I'm raising the bar
Flexing 'til I bust a vein now I'm raising the bar
You'd think that this shit is a game how I'm raising the bar

[Verse 2]
Raising the bar like I'm popping Xanax
I'm just saving the world like I'm Captain Planet
Tell 'em give me my seeds just so I can plant 'em
That way I know it will not do damage
Take what I want and I act like I got no manners
Got a full house like Danny Tanner
Then I'm ghost just like Danny Phantom
Play my cards right like I was Gambit
Never home like my house abandoned
Breaking down stories like wrecking balls
I used to go to the Wrecking Ball
Gotta give back I feel less involved
Know shooters that got them ARs
I do not mean artists in repertoire
Pro Era, Beast Coast, yeah that's the squad
Claiming you with us, man that's just fraud
Story don't add up, man that's just odd
My city so cold, the AC look like snow and the tree that I'm blowing will have you frost

[Hook]
Bottle service on the plane now I'm raising the bar
Think it's high jumping, we play hard I'm raising the bar
Flexing 'til I bust a vein now I'm raising the bar
You'd think that this shit is a game how I'm raising the bar
Bottle service on the plane now I'm raising the bar
Think it's high jumping, we play hard I'm raising the bar
Flexing 'til I bust a vein now I'm raising the bar
You'd think that this shit is a game how I'm raising the bar
