[Intro]
Cookin' soul

[Bridge]
Yo x28
Pro Era yeah we running this rap shit
PEEP the aPROcolypse and call it the rapture
Was on a rap tour, now I feel like a raptor
Blame wack rappers for this disaster

[Verse 1: CJ Fly]
Aw yeah guess they didn't know it was our year
To us it ain't at all fair we makin' them all scared
Rethinkin' they sound worried bout they career
Felt it was an accident while bumpin in the car rear
Wanted more but he wasn't sure
In a great depression why he willingly indures
School of hardnocks eye the pupil let life take his course
Way too much momentum for you to stop this force
Either you run with us or get ran over bad enough I'm poor
In my chalice where they pour, til I get hangovers
In motion for some time now
On the top ain’t tryna climb down
Keep the throne we won’t stop until they give us our crown
Stand up guy that won’t need deceit
Living my dream, so only in death I’ll get me some sleep
Not a homo sapiens feel like an alien that came from kings
You read bull if you think that Red Bull's what gave me wings

[Hook]
Wherever you go, just know
Always remember you pro, you pro
I said we came so far, came so far
So I'mma aim for the stars, and I'mma aim for the stars

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
It's inevitable, though I never do bull
Kind of bugged feel like a tug when I take every pull
The illest bars I kick em when the drums starts hitting and the melody good
Writing these verses til my personal and memory bank full
Might be a lot for me take in
Flowing from the basin to the great springs
Yeah I'm tryna eat but rather feast like we became kings
Gone keep on saying we the best until it's inculcated
Til the message get pervaded
Said we next the best the heaviest and deadliest invasion
Those who know about the era won't view us on a disdain tip
Stay sharp with murderous thoughts while I'm killing their hopes
I mean business with my company but still feel alone
Committing crimes in the past times just been getting me stoned
I been iller than most sitting in their limos
If it get cold in my zip code, then I zip up coat
Hit the mainstream only hope should be stay afloat

[Hook]
[Bridge]
