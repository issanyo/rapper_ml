[Hook]
Seen the realest niggas come and go
Get out the hood we got a common goal
Swear I love it when we on a roll
I just wanna be perennial
Seen the realest niggas come and go
Get out the hood we got a common goal
Swear I love it when we on a roll
I just wanna be perennial

[Verse]
If it's my energy and good can't waste my life force
I got the sneakers you've been saving your whole life for
I used to have Jordans when I was like four
Don't ask me why I sell them YSL kicks I had like four
The all white valley sneakers with the patent leather
Navy blue Prada shoes just to match the denim
Blue suede Gucci sneakers man I had to get em
All my jackets vintage and they came in lambskin leather
That's fly, never had it but got by
Feel real good only things that you can't find
Not about the money, some things you just can't buy
Canâ€™t reveal my sources some people would chastise
Impatient and I never like waiting
My music savin' lives and you just spend your life savings
Back when God be turnin' a new leaf this shit is life changing
The flow is cold so yo my toes show up like we ice skating
Just hopped off a flight, I'm tryna find my bed
Dead stock with designers wanna buy your bed
Certain chicks I really wonder why I tap
Get it off your chest with no rap snitchin' like a wiretap
Got a taste for the finer things I acquired that
Been makin' waves remember nights that I applied to DEX
I'm the moon tied to earth, I aspired that
Put my pinky in cassette tapes to rewind it back

[Hook]
Seen the realest niggas come and go
Get out the hood we got a common goal
Swear I love it when we on a roll
I just wanna be perennial
Seen the realest niggas come and go
Get out the hood we got a common goal
Swear I love it when we on a roll
I just wanna be perennial

[Outro]
I just wanna be perennial
I just wanna be perennial
I just wanna be perennial
I just
