[Intro]
They can tell me I ain't up
I can feel the vibration
They can tell me I ain't up (Fly)

[Hook]
They can tell me I ain't up, told my niggas stay patient
Maybe try meditation, can't describe the sensation
I can feel the vibration
I can feel the vibration
They can tell me I ain't up, told my niggas stay patient
Maybe try meditation, can't describe the sensation
I can feel the vibration
I can feel the vibration

[Verse 1]
Be stressin', sometimes we forgettin' to breathe
Don't play with me because you're not in my league
Was sleepin' on me like I had em' for tea
Droppin' gems like I'm a clumsy jewel thief
Admit that we strayed off the path a bit
My chakras could use some balancin'
Been goin' through it but we been managin'
Word, all the temptations is challenging
I utilize every chance I get
If they talkin' shit I ain't hearin' it

[Hook]
They can tell me I ain't up, told my niggas stay patient
Maybe try meditation, can't describe the sensation
I can feel the vibration
I can feel the vibration
They can tell me I ain't up, told my niggas stay patient
Maybe try meditation, can't describe the sensation
I can feel the vibration
I can feel the vibration

[Verse 2]
I do not need a Xanax 'cause I'm feeling Zen
Only positive vibes what I'm trying to send
I can only get flyer, I'm trying to ascend
It don't work the first time then keep trying again
Things won't be smooth in the physical
Unless you fine from within
I roll up every leaf, swear it's such a relief
So much stress I'm releasin', for once I'm at peace
No one troublin' me, nothing fuckin' with me
Now I got buzz like a bee
I'm not worried about what shouldn't be

[Hook]
They can tell me I ain't up, told my niggas stay patient
Maybe try meditation, can't describe the sensation
I can feel the vibration
I can feel the vibration
They can tell me I ain't up, told my niggas stay patient
Maybe try meditation, can't describe the sensation
I can feel the vibration
I can feel the vibration
(Fly)
