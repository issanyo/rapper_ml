[Hook]
Young when the doc cut my umbilical
This the shit I had dream't about in middle school
Watched the B.E.T. awards inside my living room
Like the Beatles, double deckers out in Liverpool
Young when the doc cut my umbilical
This the shit I had dream't about in middle school
Watched the B.E.T. awards inside my living room
Like the Beatles, double deckers out in Liverpool

[Bridge]
Might gain your respect
When I make it big ain't a thing to expect
And I know as strange as it gets
Still the same gang I ain't changin' my set (Fly!)

[Verse]
Either gettin' seventeen Toyotas or that Masi' that I wanted
Prayin' for my downfall I don't want to plummet
Might be way too soon to get the Ghost
My nigga I don't want to haunt 'em
That and 'cause they know I'm lyin', can't afford one
People love me, I should probably run for POTUS
Got a chick that I get into, swear I love her
She be ridin' cause she foreign
Stare at my balls like she be tryin' to tell my fortune
Ain't seein' things straight, it's the pine that we smokin'
Cause our eyes keep on lowerin', its the mind of distortion
Ain't tired of tokin' L's, I guess I'll never forfeit
It occupied my time to keep my mind off the bullshit
My flow is so in sync, I swear that I'll never force it
Can't deny I've been focused (Fly!)

And I know as strange as it gets
Still the same gang I ain't changin' my set

[Verse 2]
Waited for this my whole damn life
Don't care what you say, I did mine
Stopped skatin' but still on my grind
Money won't make everything right
No things won't change, just ease our pain
Energy is what we get paid
Been feelin' low, could use a raise
Then the struggle gets viewed as rage
If we remain things stay the same
So much wisdom at this young age
Only thing to do is share it, I can see they don't be carin'
This that flame shit, can't you see the torch that I'm carryin'?
They just ain't shit, need to bring the alcohol
We sippin' by the cases, something like the plaintiff
Really underground, we started from the basement
Things was lookin' ugly, now the game could use a face lift (Fly!)
