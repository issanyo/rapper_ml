[Hook]
You tell em anything, but don't
You just wanna get it in, that's you
You can talk bout everything but won't
You can spark some type of change but don't

[Verse 1]
Truth is most these rappers actors
That don't think before they act
Stop putting on a show homie 'fore you get clapped
You might end up bow put yo head in yo lap
The hammer go baow, you won't l never come back
Usain on the flow when I get on these tracks, when I get on these tracks
Tryna eat, not junk food, and still get a few plaques
Don't play me like a pussy, just cause I'm a cool cat
Facts, I'm like  a glow stick that be on yo bitch
And shit get lit when I'm ready to snap
We don't need to chat, and I ain't talking about using no app
In their momma house claim they be in the trap
And some how the streets is the scene they attract
You see where I'm going, or need you a map
Can someone please tell me the meaning of that
This feel like a moment of clarity
Eat my food straight off the farm not the factory
Got myself covered, ain't nobody backin' me
Still won't stop 'til theirs millions in my salary
Workin' hard, this an artist and a masterpiece
Knew that I had no limits since I heard Master P
Schooling y'all, should've been a part of the faculty
If they still sleepin' that's jet lag
Couldn't be a freshman, ain't get left back
Only tryna progress, nigga 'F' that
Like tryna call my mother nigga step dad, nah
Just imagine that shit
Along with a list of other things that I know won't ever ever happen

[Hook]
You tell em anything, but don't
You just wanna get it in, that's you
You can talk bout everything but won't
You can spark some type of change but don't

[Outro]
They ain't saying nothing
(They ain't saying nothing)
They ain't saying nothing, They ain't saying nothing
(They ain't saying nothing)
They ain't saying nothing
(They ain't saying nothing)
They ain't saying nothing, They ain't saying nothing
(They ain't saying nothing)
Welcome to the fly trap, recording live from beast coast
