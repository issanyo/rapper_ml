[Hook]
Dollar signs, the values we respect
Living by their standards that they taught us
You already know what it is
If you don't it's depending on the way that you was brought up
Gotta keep it real with the kids
For centuries our people been tortured
Don't need to be complainin' about a thing
Got it easy, if you think you got it bad, they had it harder

[Verse 1]
Where your ass was at when they built pyramids?
Who the fuck you think had built a palace for the kids?
Stay exaggerating like you do with everything
Woulda thought that they was goin' through it everyday
Every task ain't as hard as it looks
They ain't have cars, had to walk there by foot
Just imagine how long that shit took
Then they couldn't even buy food that was already cooked
Now they sayin' they a hustler cause they sold it with an 8-ball
Claimin' movin' bricks ain't nothing like the ones that built the great wall
You can act like you don't know and be the only one to play dumb
Think we started from a ship, the motherland is where we came from
That's before they decided they wouldn't save us

[Bridge]
You think you got it bad, they had it harder
You think you got it bad, they had it harder
Don't need to be complainin' bout a thing
They was risking their lives just to maintain order
You think you got it bad, they had it harder
You think you got it bad, they had it harder
Don't need to be complainin' bout a thing
They was risking their lives just to maintain order

[Verse 2]
Sittin on my conscience, different type of conscious
Worship those with money, shit on those with nothing
They think I won't make it, treated like I ain't shit
I ain't constipated, knowledge we not ancient
Spread it like wild fire, never been a liar
Swear I been a prophet, my name ain't Elijah
Gotta get this profit, my boys keep on piling
Mama working gotta move her out the projects
Everybody know the police out here wylin'
Killin' niggas even children gettin' bodied
This is why all the rules I do not follow
They just showin' us the power of the dollar
They just showin' us the power of the dollar
Dollar signs, the values we respect
