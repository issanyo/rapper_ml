(Smoke)
Anybody want to take a look at my life
I swear they only ever see the highlights
There's been a couple times I coulda died right
It's funny now but looking at an old man at hindsight

That was a close one (that was a close one)
That was a close one
Things coulda got real bad that day
That was a close one (that was a close one)
That was a close one
Things coulda got real bad

[Verse 1]
We just left the house party in the hood
It was lit as fuck
Then a van pulled up throwing bottles at us
Then I heard "what, what" (run)

Leaping over fences [?] driveways, man
How did this night turn sideways (sideways), damn
It was me Boomin' and a few other homies
I wish I never had these Timbs on

They jumped out the back with a baseball bat
Life was the only thing I had a grip on (skrrt)
I'm out of breath I need new lungs
All I could hear "where you from?"

All I could hear "where your money at?"
All I could hear "where your shoes from?"
Ooh, say what, say what, say what
What's the last song playing

Now we looking for each other (fuck)
Did they really get a brother (stop)
Got me (praying), it coulda been worse
That's just another Friday
We never learn
Saturday coming up next

[Chorus]
That was a close one (that was a close one)
That was a close one
Things coulda got real bad that day
That was a close one (that was a close one)
That was a close one
Things coulda got real bad

[Verse 2: CJ Fly]
Party in a murder [?] it's my parents
[?]
Almost died, thinking they'll never know
Thick head, hard to hit, needn't care, had to [go/grow]
Shout to [?]
My nigga [Trevor?] was drinking way too much (too much)
But I was never in a place to judge
Bitch you know me then you know I never gave two fucks
[?]
[?]
I wasn't [?] they shoot us
[?]
Whatever happens, gon' happen
You don't bring the strap then you just got caught lackin' (flock)

[Chorus]
That was a close one (that was a close one)
That was a close one
Things coulda got real bad that day
That was a close one (that was a close one)
That was a close one
Things coulda got real bad

[Verse 3]
Red and blue lights in my rearview (yeah)
Police knocking at my door (knock knock), we don't hear you
Went and headed to a party down at central
[?] was the venue
We was looking up [?]
[?] at the party so we had to dip
On foot it was me, [Reggie?] [?] and some chick on the way out to St. Lukes
Going over fences like I'm Babe Ruth
Car slippin' down the [?] in the sea of blue
They tried to check us for our shoes
Yelling out "C's up"
Til they realised they [?] were cousins
So they us with the [?]

[Chorus]
That was a close one (that was a close one)
That was a close one
Things coulda got real bad that day
That was a close one (that was a close one)
That was a close one
Things coulda got real bad

[Voice]
What's really good?
Yes today was a bad day
Man, shit really hit the fan day
Mmm, what about tonight?
If they pull up at the lights
Get [?] out the van day
What's really good?
Yes today was a bad day
Man, shit really hit the fan day
Mmm, what about tonight?
If they pull up at the lights
Get [?] out the van day
