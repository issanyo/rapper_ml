[Verse]
Now once again, a deep thought of Aaliyah
Crosses my mind, I rethought that I seen her, all in my mind
Memories of Big, all in the lime light
All of the time, all on his grind, right
I'm blacking out about 'Pac, blacking out on them cops
Middle finger, after blacking out from them shots
And I go visit Shyne, in my distant mind
I tell him stay up, cause in there it's a different grind
I see Eazy and Jam Master laughin'
Big L still rappin', like it never happened
I got a sixth sense with me, God picked then sent me
To this earth place, to win in the first place
Visions of mommy, on an island somewhere
Yeah, I designed just for my mommy, oh!
My whole life is a blessin', that's why I'm so nice, so right
Approach mics with aggression
I got the type of obsession I would like to progress in
I write about me, and the life of my henchmen
I blow dice, roll twice to the deuce
That was nights, that was life on the stoop
This shit gotta change, can't forget the hard white in the boot
White car stripped with the blue
NARCs parked right in the coupe, damn
They ridin' around with a license to shoot
I'm ridin' around with no license and hoop, follow me now
Follow me down, this yellow brick road
187, hello, every ghetto's zip code
I had to change my pace up, so I went left, while everybody went right
Had to switch the race up, now I'm better off
Met Cam set it off, did the mixtape now look Dipset is off
Put the bid in Def Jam bet it all
First writers refusal, Dame wouldn't let us off
So we matched it, we signed labels with Dashius
Cam goes platinum, the 'Set is up next
A double album, we set for the best
Juelz is the test, which is me, fail or succeed
But still I'm here in the flesh, handing you breath
Mixed with a lot of thought, The Santana Robb Report
I bring you more than just music
I bring you me and all of my movement
I bring my whole life all in the booth, shit
And I'm all in the booth with, the headphones on
The lights cut down, and all of this true shit
