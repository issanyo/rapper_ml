[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
As I kick back and relax, shorty head in my lap
In the back of the Bentley, getting head in the back
And she ain't got a head from a nap, so pushin on her head from the back, give me that
Up and down, down and up, give me that
Laffy Taffy came on, she give me head to the snaps
She make me like the song, she wrong
She bout action, bout work
She suck dick like a vacume suck durt
I'm a quick picker upper, cause she quick to pick me out
Quicker than a nigga tell her, pick the nut up
Now let me tell you bout this 6 shot Roogger
That I keep for you busters if you twitch, I shoot shit
I'll buck ya, I'll bang ya, move ya like a dead car battery
Trust me, boost ya, no car cables
I'll hang ya, like a coat in the closet, no coat on the hanger
Just hanging in the closet, boy, I could just leave you where you stand, or I could just shoot you in the end, meet you where you land

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I came to rep my hood, I gotta ride clean
I gotta smoke good
I'm ballin on big, fancy cars like Suge
I ain't gotta explain what's already understood
Baby, I'm a G, I'm just tryna get more
I'm hot as 3 80, keep it warm like wool
Niggas talkin shit, I wish a nigga would
Boy, smellin like shit, from a bull, boy
I gotta lot, but I could never get enough
Man, the 26 inches got the Lolo sittin up
Mack could fix it, so you need to hit him up
Rocky Marsiano, I beat the pussy up
You not a Saprano, pussy nigga, get fucked
Hit a nigga from a hundred yards away
You really ain't prepared, dog, chopper split your ass in half, not even share ya
That's the game, stop lookin for a fair call
Pussy cat niggas, watch you cough up a hairball
Lookin at niggas, like why you scared, dog
Chopper rip you apart, doesn't cut hair, dog
These niggas Aerosol, soft shell Taco
Move in the Farari like a wild horse, or in my case, a mob boss
Feel my swagger, nigga
I'm walkin round with a chopper and a dagger
You play with me, faster
Pop pop, don't play with me, Casper
Duct tape, don't play with the rapper
I send it to m whole, they goin cut it faster
Bitch, make me bitch
If not, make me cum, then make me twist
Bitch, blowin these dice, make me bitch
Watch me grip my whole hand on the 8 or 6
The 5 or the 4 or the 10 or the 9
Hey lil rapper, it's fighting time
