[Intro]
Man all I hear is Santana this, Santana that
Santana you can't do this, Santana you can't do that
Man why I can't I just smoke a blunt and be me
That's how I feel..
Okay it's Santana, I'm back again
You know what man? What? What?
This is... (hooow I feeel) yeah, oh

[Verse]
You fuckas don't know a damn thing about me (nope)
A piece, a part, a hamstring about me
The streets my heart you can't get it out me, it's (hooow I feeel)
You fuckas know me, it was a sharp throb in my bones
I looked it was my own flesh, heart, and my bones
Problems at home
So I left 'em there, got up out the hemisphere
Misery loves company, I don't respect that there
Dipset on the posta, boy for comin' so close to
Being the black La Costra Nostra
Jim is my big buzzin', Zeek's my big cousin
Killa's my big nigga, also my big brother
We are the Dip family, get a grip, family
Nothin' alive can divide this family
So come on roll with the Set, come on roll with the best
Where pain is felt niggas notice you stressed, oh!
The game itself don't notice your stress
You get left smokin', zonin' on steps, no!
That's not the way to go, but that's the way you'll go
If you don't get up off you ass and find a way to go
Streets to rap, yeah that's the way I went
Now it's beats and rhymes, that's the way I pay the rent
Fuck what ya think nigga, 'cause this is.. (hooow I feeel)
Niggas know me
