[Chorus: Young Ja]
Bitch hit my brother, your mother die
Niggas ain't playin', it's homicide
Hundred round drum, we gon' let it fly
Came with my dog, we can't let this slide
Dissin' my brother, the summer done
Summer of Cane goin' number one
Dissin' my brother, the summer done
Summer of Cane goin' number one

[Verse 1: Young Ja]
Nigga keep callin' the truce shit
Nigga you dummy, you stupid
We sendin' them shots, we root shit
My niggas get mad, they get ruthless
It was a set-up, you next up
Hit everywhere from your neck up
Didn't tell my dog, man that's fucked up
Kenya, he know we don't check up
Look around all of them trigger spots
Don't wanna see news when these bodies drop
Fuck all you niggas from other sides
They tell my brother it's time to slide
They killin' for me, shootin' for Mike
Nigga you should've thought twice
Play with the gang, score on my bro
Nigga you losin' your life
Oh you thought you was gon' get away?
Nigga we knockin' like 808's
We find the shooter, he die today
We pullin' up where your mama stay
All of them bitches, they gettin' shot
All of the killers, they spinnin' blocks
Nigga sneak dissin', we hit his top
All of them niggas, they gettin' got, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Young Ja]
Last time I was with my nigga we was ballin'
Now I gotta see him laid up in that coffin
Late night, I got that call, I almost lost it
Now we lurkin', spinnin' blocks, we tryna pause shit

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Damn, this shit is really ugly
They took my nigga country
They took my nigga from me
Now all the killers hungry
They lookin' to eat
They ain't lookin' for peace
They treat this shit like halal
When it's beef they cook in the streets
Summer of Cane, we gotta keep this shit runnin' for sure
We took a big loss, now it's just time to run up the score
They took my brother, will never sleep
'Til them niggas layin' forever deep
And you know we put that on everything
My niggas slidin' on everything
My niggas poppin' on everything
Them bullets is flyin' at everything
Somebody droppin' on everything
My nigga Cane was so lit
AKA explosive
No we don't tolerate ho shit
We bust him down like a whole brick
As soon as we find out who lined him
We callin' the barbers to line him
You know them clippers gon' fry him
Niggas get hit with the iron
And you know we twist 'em like pliers
And they wonder why we rode with the grip in the ride
'Cause we dyin' to live, but it's like we just livin' to die

[Pre-Chorus: Young Ja]
Last time I was with my nigga we was ballin'
Now I gotta see him laid up in that coffin
Late night, I got that call, I almost lost it
Now we lurkin', spinnin' blocks, we tryna pause shit

[Chorus: Young Ja]
Bitch hit my brother, your mother die
Niggas ain't playin', it's homicide
Hundred round drum, we gon' let it fly
Came with my dog, we can't let this slide
Dissin' my brother, the summer done
Summer of Cane goin' number one
Dissin' my brother, the summer done
Summer of Cane goin' number one
