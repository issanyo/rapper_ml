[Jim Jones]
Yo, my homey Cash, well he's gone for five
Send my prayers, do your thing, I'll be going for mine
Cause, we live life to the fullest
Three hundred and sixty five nights on the strike, that's a bullet
Now, uncle Ricky got a month and some change
And it feels like the garbage truck just dumping the pain
All on my shoulders, I'm warning my soldiers
The nights could get chilly, the morning's much colder
I've seen summers get cold
And playa's do it up until the point and that they done and they fold
They can't succumb to the cold
Those of frostbitten, up north sitting
Just like some f'n lost kittens
They get locked up for carrying boy
They doing time up in Marion, boy, uh
I respect you
You do your time like Gotti, and come home like that Marion boy
Dipset, Holla

[Juelz Santana]
It's Santana, get ready
December
Messin with the gangstas, riders, uh uh
Ya'll messin with some gangstas, riders, 9/11 survivors
Ya'll still want beef, then holla
You think you 'bout it, get your piece and holla
Squeeze the piece when I think it's problems, do you follow?
Young Muhammad Atta, no plane lessons
Cocaine lessons to supply the towers, I had
Before they crashed and divided the towers
I'm hurtin' working hard to reprovide the towers
Told you, you messin with a gangsta boy
You messin with some gangstas, boy
Don't do that
You got coke, don't move that
These blocks belong to us, homie
Remember I told you that
As for your boys, there’s no more messages
If I see you pumping, I'm steppin' in my weapons and
I'm shooting off to the death of him
If he try to run shots ahead of him
He's already done and tell 'em (tell em)
Welcome to New York City (uh ohh)
No, Welcome to Dipset City (holla)
And thanks to Cam, I'm Harlem's new anchorman
Yes, chump, you should shake my hand
Cause the coupé will make you too cocky
And I'm not gon' wanna talk to you dudes who move sloppy
So move, watch me
Stand still - don't move, watch me
I'ma show you how to do this, yeah

[Cam'ron]
I'm gonna break it down real quick, yo
Ayo, look, dog, I bought villas
Stayed in resorts, scrilla
How extort Killa? I extort killas
Man I caught killas, disarmed four killas
Cat frontin'?: pop pop, poor killas
Who more realer? Weed in the four wheeler
Eff Mike, till you see me you never saw 'Thriller'
Fishscale, fish scales, gorillas
Dirty whore want me to go raw, will ya?
Smart Pisces fresh from the Archdiocese
You got heart, fight me, I'll dearly depart wifey
I'm Anfernee I do things the Hardaway
Pardon me, Escalade, marmalade, mama stayed
And I send 'em where stars'll play
And i do cop a car today, color pink Chardonnay
And I'll clap at ya man, clap the clappers
Clap on clap off, clap at his hands
Only thing he ever clapped was his hands
He'll get butt-raped, duct-taped, the Michelin man, bastard
Get in the van, listen to Cam, maggot
Get in this van, listen to Cam, maggot
Listen, let's bring it back, you know why?
Cause this is the year when cats get shipped in the van
Envision my plan, listen to me, listen
I miss the era of the BMBB's
I was ducking GMDC
Had that scope, aim and I'll light ya
Seen all islands, Caymans to Rikers
Contain, detain, maintain, complain
The game is for lifers
I don't care
I'll put flame in the fire
Christian, atheist, you pray to Allah you just
Don't play, okay, just pray I don't snipe ya
Cause with the SK
Doggy I'm OK
My AK was my AKA
Before my ABC's had me A' OK
I'll show you how to make 2 million out ya deal
For the right price, I could get you out ya deal
Smack ya CEO
That's when the TEC is soarin
$4 mil' from Def Jam and I ain't sold a record for 'em
