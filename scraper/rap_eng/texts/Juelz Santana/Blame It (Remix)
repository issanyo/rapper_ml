80 Q get my levels right (let's go get it)
Ay tell the waiter pick up the whole bar, and just bring it over here
We trying to get drunk, and we get money
Yeap
Uh, Blame it on the goose, the patron, or the henny
Blame it on them all, cause all of them bottles empty
I'm a leave this club when I'm dizy, and all I wanna know is who's comming with me
Blame it on the liquor, cause by the end of the night that ain't the only thing you gonna have in ya
You tryna get with me, I'm tryna get with ya
I can see me inside you like a mirror, and I got a whole bedroom full of mirros
Let's use it, so we see what we doin, what we do, and how we do it
Go to sleep, wake up like "why the hell we do it? "
"What the hell was we doin? ", and "Why the hell we do it? "
Haha
I must of been drunk cause if not I would of kicked your ass out when I was done
But for now, raise your bottles and your cups up, say it with me
Everybody in the club gettin tipsy
Blame it on the Goose (goose)
Got you feeling loose (loose)
Blame it on Petron ('tron)
Got you in the zone (zone)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the Vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the Blue Tap
Gotcha feeling dizzy
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the alcohol
Uh, yeah
Blame it on who, blame it on me
She drank till she sleep and she drank it on me
I live in her cup, I watch the ice sink
She sippin all night on some shit that's light pink
Ya know they say, ya always to drink
But baby I gotta be Louie the thirteenth
And I could talk to, but nobody hear
I lick her so good she don't go around beer
Yeaah, heh, and shawty got class
Shawty got class and so she pour me in a glass
Ayy shawty take me to the hay
One more shot of me and shawty be dead
Hehe, and shawty just love drunk
She need a designated driver cause she love drunk
Hey there bar tender what's your name
Lemme buy this woman a bottle of Lil Wayne
Blame it on the Goose (goose)
Got you feeling loose (loose)
Blame it on Petron ('tron)
Got you in the zone (zone)
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
Blame it on the Vodka
Blame it on the Henny
Blame it on the Blue Tap
