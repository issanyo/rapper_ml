[Intro]
Guess what
I'm back
A!
Santana, DipSet Bitch!
You know, you know

[Hook]
We stay G'd up, we make these bucks, we make things jump
No thanks to you
We blaze weed up, we invade these clubs, we make things jump
No thanks to you
From the beat to the boogie, to the street to the hoody
This is gangsta shit
Let you get down to the beat, and just boogie to the beat, shake your tooshy
If you like gangsta shit

[Verse]
Gangsta niggas, gangsta bitches
Get on up, get gangsta wit us
Or should I say, get gangsta wit me
I gangsta boogie, through this gangsta city
Get dough, hit hoes, hit flow, big 4, get low, 'for I bang at you
Pitch blow, big blow, big thang, big 'Rols, you know, no thanks to you
And shorty you can catch me stuck, cause the weed, yup
Screamin "Hi! My name is" Deez Nutts
G's up, hoes down, thats how it been, how it is, and how it goes down
From my young G's wit the clip in the black 5th
To my old G's wit the pick wit the black fist
This is gangsta shit, full blown gangsta shit, you kno, gangsta shit, A!

[Hook]
We stay G'd up, we make these bucks, we make things jump
No thanks to you
We blaze weed up, we invade these clubs, we make things jump
No thanks to you
From the beat to the boogie, to the street to the hoody
This is gangsta shit
Let you get down to the beat, and just boogie to the beat, shake your tooshy
If you like gangsta shit

[Hook]
Check it
Now don't you wanna be like us?
Cut it out
You can't be like us
Now don't you wanna be like us?
Cut it out

[Verse]
Pop it like its hot, like Snoop said
*pop pop* Dr-drop it like its hot
Which one of y'all want your coochie rubbed?
Im fucked up and Im lookin for some groupie love
Yall hoes know why Im here
And its not to send y'all bottles or buy y'all beer
I might send over some eye contact
And let you know Im tryin to hop on that
And if you send back the eye contact
Then I know, its time to go to the pop off shack
Im a gangsta, I like to do gangsta shit
Like gangsta boogie wit my gangsta bitch
So come, gangsta boogie wit a gangsta bitch
Come see how the gangstas live
And you'll see it ain't no fronts or tellin lies
This gangsta shit here, must be televised

[Hook]
