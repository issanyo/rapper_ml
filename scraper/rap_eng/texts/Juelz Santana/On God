[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Ay (Freekey)
Dip-set (Jones, Killa, Ay), bitch
Ay
M-M-M-Murda

[Chorus: Belly & Juelz Santana]
Whoa
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the set
All my dawgs camouflaged-out lookin' like it’s war
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Lookin' like it's war
Dipset
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the squad

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
No stress, boy, we blessed
We stunt, yeah, we flex
But we don’t play, this ain't recess
This ain't a game, ain't no reset
Pistol sound like a boombox, you don't want me to press eject
Defense, defense, my niggas stay on defense
Let a nigga touch mine, bet he die, that's an instant reflex
Do it all for the squad, put that on God, no false pretense
I'm at the bank, co-signin' big deals, only time I get G checked
My life’s a movie, yeah, action-packed, no green screen special effects
Bitch heard ’bout the pipe game, she askin' me if she could be next
Told her, "Hell yeah, damn right, but you gotta let the squad beat next"
Gotta know never trust a hoe ’cause she just a Devil in a cheap dress
Money comin' by the load, get it, spend it, then repeat that

[Chorus: Belly & Juelz Santana]
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the set
All my dawgs camouflaged-out lookin' like it's war
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Lookin’ like it's war
Dipset
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the squad

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
(Capo)
Same niggas I would die for, over them niggas you might die for (Facts)
Always ready to apply war (Work)
What'chu think I pack four-fives for? (Get 'em)
Main events we got fly for (Drip)
Doesn't matter what the ride cost (Skrt)
Two doors but it drive four (Skrt, skrt)
Too much drip, gotta dry off (Drip)
Clap a nigga wit' my Rollie on, it's bust down when I bust around (Buck!)
Take the shooters on a jet with me
It's five choppers when we touch down (Boom!)
Turn tough guys into fuck boys, fuck boys get fucked around (Fuck 'em)
I'm just sayin' what we ready for, let's keep a piece when I touch your town
How ya starrin' in a movie? (Denzel)
Ain't nobody gon' be actin' (No)
Kane gang, what's good? (Soo woo!)
Hoppin' out, what's brackin'? (What's brackin'?)
The young boys on everything, pills, weed, they be on the drink (Damn!)
Clap a nigga where a nigga stand
Then pour it up and won't even blink (On God)

[Chorus: Belly & Juelz Santana]
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the set
All my dawgs camouflaged-out lookin' like it's war
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Lookin' like it's war
Dipset
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the squad

[Verse 3: Cam'ron & Belly]
Kill, kill, kill, Killa
Kill, kill, kill, uhh
Look, I ride around, you could buy the pounds I got in the trunk
Listen here, let's get real
You fuckin' with a big deal
Girl with some pigtails
We in some sick hills, baggin' up fishscale
Breakin' them big bills, six mil', sit still
Fuck around and get killed
Bullet holes get filled
Ice is nice, don't ask the price
It's nothin' nice, you might just get chilled
God, I would die for anybody in the squad- squad-squad-squad
So please believe me, that's all for G.B
I was with the Set when I got shot in D.C. (I was!)
B-B got shot (Yeah)
Ze-Ze-Ze-Zeek got shot (Yeah)
It's all for the Set, all for the Set, we all off the block (Yeah!)
My Ohio niggas (Who else?)
Niggas from Opa Locka (Yes!)
My Cali crew they stay high off coke and Vodka (Woo woo)
Boat-boat-boat-boat is dockin' (Dockin')
We load the choppers (Blow!)
For you bitch niggas (Fuck boys) and hoes that watch us
Kill, kill, kill, yeah

[Outro: Belly & Juelz Santana]
On God, I would die for anybody in the squad
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
Die for anybody in the squad
