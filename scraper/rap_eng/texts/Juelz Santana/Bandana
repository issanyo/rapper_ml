Dipset
Juelz Santana, man
I mean I'm drownin' you niggas out there
I swear
Ay! You niggas know me!
I mean, the pictures gettin' clearer and clearer, baby
Oh yeah, holla atcha boy
You niggas know me!
Album coming soon What the Game's Been Missing
I mean, I'm just gettin' comfortable, baby
You know what it is
Ay!

I'm the most incredible, yes, to ever do this here
You'll never do this here, I'll forever do this, yeah
Santana, man you bandana
Damn you wrapped around a cannon handle
So sicker, so swiffer I just won't give up
Till my clock stop tick-a-tick-a-tickin' nigga
Rap is my duty I'm back to my duty
So supplying the streets with crack is my duty
I will not fail, I will be chopped, scaled
Sold, used, Glock, bail
I will be everything that these rappers are not
Hard, hot, real, stop, chill
Don't confuse it, stupid
Look around, Dipset, we the only movement movin'
Watch you creeps play out before the beat play out
Here's a brief layout
My aim is to blow, I can't be contained or controlled
It's comin' through my veins like it's dope
I live to have it
I'm itchin', twitchin', I need it, I can't kick the habit
And just because I'm focused on rap
Don't be focused on that, I'm always loaded and strapped
So you bustas ain't fuckin' safe
I'm still man handlin' that fuckin' 8

Ay!
Hahah, aww man
I see it's gettin' real dark for you niggas out there, man
The clouds is really startin' to come over you niggas, man
I swear to God, Juelz Santana, More Crack
Look forward to the future
Ay! You niggas know me!
