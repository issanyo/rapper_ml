[Vere 1: Lil Wayne]
Like I dropped straight from heaven
Five strong words: rest in peace Lil Kevin
And this ain't how I was born
But this is how I live
So that's how I'll die, and do not close my eyes
So when you see me in the casket I'm a look right back at ya
Cause I don't trust none of y'all
Fuck every one of y'all
Now which one of y'all wanna brawl?
And overall I got that pistol under all of my garments
Torment, torture
Tragedy, catastrophe
No battery, just murder in the coldest temperature
And that means first degree
Even deaf motherfuckers done heard of me
I ain't gonna let you motherfuckers worry me
And tell that beef I'm Burger King
I represent that saint's sign
I'm so high I can paint signs
And if she ain't fine, she ain't mine
Thank god that I'm alive
But if he end it all today, I have done more that I can say
(Amen)

[Hook: Lil Wayne & Juelz Santana]
Let's pray (let's pray)
Ten fingers (ten fingers)
Together for forever (forever)
Let's pray (let's pray)
Together (together)
Forever, forever

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
The Lord is my shepherd
You haters can't harm me
I walk with his blessings
The angels be my army
Of course there's a weapon on my waist within arm's reach
That's my baby keep it strapped in like a car seat (yes)
Though I walk through the valley in the shadows of death
Forgive me Lord I had to carry my tech
I touch cash and get cheese
Play with that cash I bust mags, indeed
Forgive those who trespassed against me
For they know not what they do until they history
Gone, memories
Lord grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change
Like what happens when I get up with my enemies
Paybacks, penalties
Bang back, send em' these
Funerals, these people got to waste more Hennessey (yeah)
They got to pour it on the floor for ya
Maybe next time they'll pray a little more for ya

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kidd Kidd]
I pray to God not Lucifer
Devil I'm rebuking ya
Lord have mercy on my soul when I'm suited up
Daddy was a hustla, mommy was a Christian
Momma said prayers, daddy steady cookin' chicken
If I'm living life wrong, I don't wanna be right
Send me blessings to the cloud, hope I make it through the night
Dear Lord as you lay me down to sleep
I pray to the Lord my soul to keep
If I shall die before I wake
Then I pray to the Lord my soul to take
There shall be no other god before thee
Lord please forgive me of my sins if I O.D, slowly
I know I should not kill but I will
If a nigga try to shoot me and lay me still
I'm so sorry for the wrong thing's that I've done
This the end of my prayer we all say amen

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Dear God
As I begin this day, my thoughts turn to you
And I ask for your help and guidance in everything I say and do
Give me the patience that I need to keep my peace of mind
And with life's cares, I hope dear God, some happiness to find
Let me live but for today, not worrying what's ahead, for I have trust that you
Will see I get my daily bread
Give me the courage to face life's trials and not from troubles run
And let me keep this thought in mind "Thy will, not mine, be done."
And if some wish I do not get though I have prayed to thee
Please help me to believe and understand you know what's best for me
I've failed you many time, I know
But tonight when I rest
I hope that I can say, "Dear God, I've tried my best....rapper alive."
