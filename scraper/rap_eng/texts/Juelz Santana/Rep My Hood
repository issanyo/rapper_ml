[Juelz Santana:]
As I sit back relax shawty head in my lap
In the back of the Bentley gettin head in the back (you know)
And she ain't gotta head full of nap so I'm pushin on her head from the back
Gimme that (gimme that)
Up and down, down and up gimme that laffy taffy came on she gave me head to
The snaps like (doom doom da doom doom)
She made me like the song and she wrong
She bout action, bout work, she suck dick like a vacuum suck dirt
I call her the quicker picker upper cause she quick to pick a nut up
Quicker than a nigga tell her pick the nut up ya dig bitch
Now let me tell you about this six shot ruger that I keep for u busters if you twitch I'll
Shoot ya, I'll buck ya, I'll bang ya
I'll remove ya like a dead car battery trust me I'll boost ya no car cables
I'll hang ya like a hanger in the closet, no coat on the hanger
Just hang ya in the closet
Boy, I can just leave you where you stand or I could shoot you in the air
And then meet you where you land

[Lil Wayne:]
I can't feel my face
Yeah I can't feel my face (yea)
I came to rep my hood
I gotta ride clean
I gotta smoke good
I'm pullin on big fat cigars like Suge
I ain't gotta explain, what's already understood
Baby I'm a G, I'm just tryna get full
That hot ass 380, keep me warm like wool
Nigga's talkin shit, I wish a nigga would, boy
Smellin like shit from a bull, boy
I got alot but I can never get enough
And man them 26 inches got the low low sittin up (yup)
Mama I can fix ya so you need to hook it up (yup)
Rocky Marciano how I beat the pussy up (yup)
You not a soprano play pussy get fucked
Hit a nigga from a hundred yards like (puck)
You  really ain't prepared dog
Chopper split ya ass in half now they can share yall
That’s the game stop lookin for a fair call
Pussy cat nigga's watch them cough up a hair ball
Lookin at nigga's like why you gotta stare dog
Choppers cut heads off, it doesn't cut hair off
These nigga's air soft, yea soft shell taco, mild sauce
Move the Ferrari like a wild horse
Or I'll get chauffeured like a mob boss
Yeah feel my swagger knacker
I'm sharper than a knife sword blade and dagger
Don't play with me bastard (buck em buck em buck em)
Don't play with me Casper
Duct tape don't break the wrapper
I sell it to em whole they gon’ pay me faster (yea)
Bitch make me rich, if not make me cum then make me grits
Bitch blow these dice, make me rich
Now watch me bet my whole hand on a 8 or a 6
A 10 or a 4, a 5 or 9
Hey hey little rappers it's survival time
