[Intro: Belly]
The realest high is being high alone, you know
The realest high is being high alone, you know
Born alone I'mma die alone
Realest high is being high alone

[Verse 1: Belly]
Take a second, you should take a second
You already took one, trynna take a second
You over there waiting, they over there hating
You fly to L.A., that's Californication
Borderline obsession, keep possessed by possession
Every girl look like sunday, girl that body's a blessing
Go to church every Thursday, pop that pussy on Monday
XO shit bitch we run it, put these drugs in your stomach
Like down to hatch, down to hatch
She's just down to match, now she found a pack
I swear ride alone, no ride alone
You know I love to fuck with you
But...

[Pre-Hook: Belly]
The realest high is being high alone, you know
The realest high is being high alone, you know
Born alone I'mma die alone
Realest high is being high alone

[Hook: Belly]
That's why she wanna take the pain away, she do
Drugs, pills, that too
Alcohol, that too
Trying to numb her body, cause love kills
Love kills, love kill, love
And she want it in the worst way
High heels, she take it all
She just wants your money, cause love kills
Love kill, love kill, love kill, love kill

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Love K-I-double-L-S
But we rather die having sex
So I kill that pussy
And she just fuck me to death
We be licking and sucking, we be tripping and bugging
We be sleeping and fucking, we be drinking and drugging
Between this dick and these drugs
She might OD all this D in her stomach
But then again why we fucking
It's like she [?] out the mouth while I'm pumping
Hold op she cumming, I just keep pumping, I get it in
Just stick in the toungue and bring the pussy back to life
Just to go kill it again
Treat that pussy like soil, I'm looking for oil
There I go drilling again
This dick got her addicted, she keep trynna kick it
But there she start itching again
There she go twitching again, she need that fixing again
She know I'm with again, I'm 'bout to get again

[Hook: Belly]

[Outro: Belly]
The realest high is being high alone, you know
The realest high is being high alone, you know
Born alone and die alone
Realest high is being high alone
