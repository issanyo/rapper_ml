[Hook: Sam Cooke]
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Where my muscle, you be dazzing
But hustling's a hassle
Percocet, Demerol, capsules of Paxil
Cops wanna cuff you, niggas wanna clap you
Bitches might burn you, they running with that clap too
But the monster made it
Do it for those who incarcerated
Who had it confiscated?
Hate it when they take powder
I'm steady take showers
Baby mama on Greyhound for 8 hours
See her man face to face through a glass
On the phone, 10 years he got chasing that cash
Cocaine, he had the game in a smash
Felt like the towers, when the planes went on crash
It wasn't 9-1-1, but it was 9 on 1
Gave him 9 plus 1, dropped a dime on dun
I told him get his 9 and run
Turned himself in, I had to find that dum
That's too long

[Hook: Sam Cooke & Cam'Ron]
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come
Dipset bitch, Dipset bitch
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come
Oh yes it will

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Nowadays, dawg, they raid up in the ballparks
Blaze 'em when they cross sharks
We raiders of the lost art
I'm like a ball player, shake up and cross narcs
They get mad when I lay up in the Porsche box
More props, RIP my poor pops
Can't see a son shine like the Four Tops
That's just what I sold dope for tops
For a second, 4 a rocks, for a burger, 4 a blocks
Shot out to the 4 building it's like Fort Knox
Bullets like freethrows though, sure shots
My antennas will block the scanners
I got blammers, you'll drop your hammers
Lawyers to watch lawyers
Cameras to watch cameras
Niggas to watch bitches
Nana to watch grandma
In pajamas, I snug out to watch Santa
Now look at Killa, you gon' watch Santana

[Hook: Sam Cooke]
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Now I was born by the river in a little tent
Little gate, little fence, I climbed over
Little scrapes, little dents, I got over
That was just the beginning it's not over
It's been a long time coming Cam
It's been a long time riding and a long time running man
Shit done changed since The Wop and the Running Man
Since Nino, G Money, the Carter and the Duh-Duh man
It's no longer a New Jack city
It's cop fast and move that quickly or cops crash
Spent a long time coming up this road
And I ain't talking rap man, I'm coming off this road
I'm talking crack man and coming up with O's
I'm coming up with halves and I coming out with wholes
Shit got hectic, had to come up with my hoes
They would boof it and go, I received it, moved it and roll
I was coming from the QC, Zeek was coming from the O
Jim chose to give his work to smashin' dough
We was all on the paper run
Yeah, waiting for a change to come
Now look the change has come
7-Pick up, Yukon Range is come
The day has come, Dipset remains the ones
Most hated by you other motherfuckers in this game
We remain, it's a shame cause

[Hook: Sam Cooke]
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come
It's been a long
A long time coming
But I know change gon' come
