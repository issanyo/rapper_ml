Juelz Santana:
Trips with the dufflebag, bricks in the dufflebag
Hope the dog don't come sniff through the duffle bag
Hit the town up I'm passin the dufflebag
Let the niggas know I'll be back for the dufflebag (I'm back)
And there better be cash in the dufflebag
If not, that's yo' ass, yo' ass in the dufflebag (Yep)
Life's a broad a bitch, so I brought her dick
And she enjoys all of it, ya dig (Ya dig)
The peacemaker, my piece make a mess, believe hater
You'll die now, you won't see later (Never)
For some dough and some bread
You'll be in pieces like loaf of some bread
I have your girl holding her head (hold)
She telling me I'm like a cobra in bed
I'm telling her to roll over instead (I got this)
Listen, I got some work I need boothed
After we fuck, I got some work I need moved
Now that you work for me boo
Pimpin' included, get in a skirt and these shoes
And get to workin' these dudes
(It's S.A.N.T.A.N.A. fuck wit cha boy)
I'll be back for them dollars lil' mama
And it better not be short a dollar lil' mama

We get that bread boy, we get that bread boy
We get that bread boy, we get that bread boy

Lil' Wayne:
Yeah, bitch the game ain't sweet to sugar
The coke is in the bundles, meet the pusher
I'm smokin' on the blunt of the Ashton Kusher
It's fuck you, pay me, ask a hooker
I run up on the Homie with the mask, he shook up
Honey, put the money in the bag, don't look up
Fuck y'all, boy we come cash ya cooker
Once y'all niggas switch stash is put up
I flash that dough, where the hoe bitch, G's up
I ain't doin' nuthin' but gettin' paid, y'all niggas stuck
Maserati movin' with the legs, all chromed up
21 inches man I gotta ride grown-up
Open up the belly on that new Mercedes
Got that bitch lookin' like a stray havin' a baby
But that ain't fair, but I don't care
I'm a muthafuckin' Cash Money Millionaire
I'm gettin' bread boy
