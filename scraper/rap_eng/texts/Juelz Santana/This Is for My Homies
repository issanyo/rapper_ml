[Intro: Jim Jones (Razah)]
My God, or should I say dear heavenly father
There's a lot of loved ones I'm missing out here
And I miss them dearly, it's real heartfelt
Sometimes I even cry and blow kisses to them
(This is for my homies)
So, now I lay you down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep
(For my homies that's lost and gone)
But if I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take
(See you when I get there)
Right there next to his throne
They say the floors up there is made of gold
(This is for my homies)
So, I hope they got Maybachs and all that up there
(For my homies lost in the game)
So when I cruise by I'm still flossing (see you when I get there)
And for all my G's, I hope there's a project in heaven
Y'all ain't hearing me when I say that, holla at 'em L

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Lost in pain, you already know
Okay, I see men walking, ten men walking, dead men walking
Them my peoples too, what I speak is truth
That's why Dipset is more than just the eagles dude
We know what the evil do
This for my homies man, lonely in the holy sand
Allah spot 'em, God's got 'em in his holy hands
Wish I could step to you, blow you a breath or two
But I can't, so I pour Cris' on every stoop
This is for every troop, every soldier every nigga dead and over
Let you know, you still here, it's never over
I remember days, play ball, laugh at hoes
J-Dogg, Parry O, that day's gone daddy-o
From the patio, to the el barrio
Rest in peace Jazzy-O, you know how the Caddy roll
It's a strange game, it's a changed game
We still recovering from the day that them planes came
Lot of lost souls, lot of kids parent-less
Lot of cross roads, lot of kids scared of shit
How do you cope with that? Knowing it's your closest flesh
Dead and gone, left to mourn, now hold ya breath
I'm a soldier yes, but I cried too
Ride through the rain and terrain, watching the sky move
Watchin the sky blue, that's how I do
Eyes red, high head, watching through the sky's view

[Chorus: Razah (Jim Jones)]
This is for my homies
For my homies that's lost and gone
See you when I get there (see you I get there, yeah)
(You know I'm missing you, know I miss you, my)
This is for my homies
For my homies lost in the game
See you when I get there
(I told you this one was gon' be hard, that's right)
(You know I'm missing you, know I miss you, my)

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
For everybody that's missed and gone
I don't know how to start it, so much love that departed
So I'ma start with my father, a purple heart for my father
I still remember his words, it makes me tremble in here
Had so much love for my sister, he was hugging my cousin
Thought he was hugging my sister, one of his last request
Was just to hug and to kiss her, and he been gone for years
Just to know he loved and he missed her, it had me gone in tears
I miss Sally Jones, my grandma left this child at home
Oh yeah this child's alone, she watched this child get grown
And plus I thought it was wrong, but just the thought of her gone
I'm drinking Coors 'til the morn
Back and forth, thought it was on
Yeah, I was lost for a while, but ya child, he's back
And shouts to Bloodshed, you know what left me scarred
To know you crashed the FDR, they say you left your neck ajar
You gave your breaths to God, so I know you straight
He opened up them pearly gates, me? I'm stuck a worldly fate
So I gaze at the stars, you know them glowing lights
And I say to my God, "What about my homie's life"?
Oh yeah he was a star, up in his own right
Dog I got little light, and trust me I'ma guide 'em right
So to my homies locked behind the G-wall, I miss ya
Trust me Dipset Byrd Gang man, we all do miss ya
Sending this kite to you, especially the lifers too
When you make the moves, make sure that they righteous moves

[Chorus: Razah]
This is for my homies
For my homies that's lost and gone
See you when I get there (see you I get there, yeah)
(You know I'm missing you, know I miss you, my)
This is for my homies
For my homies lost in the game
See you when I get there
(You know I'm missing you, know I miss you, my)
