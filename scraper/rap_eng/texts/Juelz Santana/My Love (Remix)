[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Uhh, for lovin' me girl
Just wanna thank you
(We gon' take it there one time, yeah)
Look at what you can do, man
(Uhh, OH! OH! Yeah)
Free, I like this shit right here man (Santana, c'mon)
Girl, c'mon
Yeah, let's do it like this

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Santana's so focused on you
Come holla at a boy that's focused on you
Uh huh, uh huh
Shorty I ain't tryin' to give you the run around
I'm just tryin' to come get you a run around
Skip through a couple towns
Maybe skip through a couple rounds
If your man act dumb I'ma shut him down
I'm sort of a long distance brother
Long trips, long chips, long dick and rubbers
Come roll with a pimp or gangsta
Hustler by nature
Trust that I'll take ya (and you know what)
I'll show you the rules and perimeters
Show you how to move with the Uz' how to handle it
Show you how the coke move soon as we scramble it
On the block as soon as the moon hit be scramblin'
And you can be my down ass
Yeah baby, that's for sure
I'ma show you how package raw
How to strap it on
How to take trips with the package on
How to go and come back with the package gone
Just stacks of cash we on, c'mon mama, oh!

[Chorus: Juelz Santana & Jim Jones]
And y'all niggas better cuff ya girls
Cause Santana and Jones is runnin' up the girls (yeah, yeah)
No game, just fuck your girls (yeah)
Uhh, pollute her mind and corrupt the world
Yeah, give her pounds, give her pies, give her cakes
Hit a town, hit a city, hit a state
Every club, every party, we fly
Bagging bitches every party and high, yeah

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Yeah, please believe me Jimmy Jizzy's the truth (yep!)
Every where I go to breezies I'm cute (yep!)
Man they tell me that I over does it
You need to slow up you over thuggin' (so what)
But the hoes slugging in the open public (uh)
I smoke like fuck it, I just roll and puff it
Now they roll up fuckin'
Take two totes and love it
Yeah yeah, plus my bitches swear (what?)
I'm like Richard Gere (yeah)
Put them in my Coupe moving fast switching gears (slow up)
Tell 'em listen here, get it crystal clear (uh)
Stay crispy to the fit and every kick I wear
Yeah yeah, she was feeling my gangsta (gangsta)
Summer time Air Ones, jeans and my tank top
I'm on the scene with the dice like bank stop
(Gettin' money, man)
Yeah, uhh, baby girl I'm a player with passport
Moving fast hundred grand on the black Porsche
Please love get your feet up off my dashboard (respect)
This is cash bought, we gonna crash course (oh, oh)

[Chorus: Juelz Santana & Jim Jones]
And y'all niggas better cuff ya girls
Cause Santana and Jones is runnin' up the girls (yeah)
No game, just fuck your girls
Uhh, pollute her mind and corrupt the world
Yeah, give her pounds, give her pies, give her cakes
Hit a town, hit a city, hit a state
Every club, every party, we fly
Bagging bitches every party and high, yeah
