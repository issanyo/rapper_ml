[Intro]
Yeah, y'all probably ain't expecting this one
Nope, yeah clap clap un hun

(Sha ba doop doop dooooo) uhh, uhh
This something my grandmother would dance to or something
(Sha ba doop doop dooooo) get up, dance with me
(Sha ba doop doop dooooo) come on now

[Chorus: singer]
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall... baby
(I know you wishing it would rain)
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall...

[Verse 1]
Yeah, ay grandma and grandpa
Look at ya grandson, I done made it far
Damn nana, I know it's killing ya bones that damn cancer
I wish I had an answer, but I don't I'm just wishing for an answer
Watchin my mamma cry, she watching her mamma die
Every second I'm drying my mamma eyes
She so proud of her son, see right through my mamma's eyes
She just follow the drips
You can't dodge the rain, but you can follow the drips
And every drop of rain that falls
Has a drop of pain involved, you better believe
'88 was cocaine and sobs
Now the dope 'caine's in charge, yup
I see my niggas for what they really are, what we really are
The Dips we really are, let it rain

[Chorus: singer]
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall... baby
(I know you wishing it would rain)
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall...

[Verse 2]
It has been long fights like this
Long days, long nights nights like this
I'm wishing for rain, nothing but the wind ever came
Little girls with they skirt up, the world's getting worser
Man I twirled through the world in a roaster
Twirling the smoke up, I be so high
Shit a week goes by, I still think the week just started
Man weed still sparking, still in tune with the street man
He still sparking, go 'head nigga leap feel frogish
These streets I harnish, my peeps my partners
Cam, Jim, Zeke, my sponsors
Black, Britz, Snags, my monsters
Paper, drugs, twin, my archor
Robs, Rawdy, Doe, guard
Bug, Train, they go hard, let it rain

[Chorus: singer]
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall... baby
(I know you wishing it would rain)
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall...

[Verse 3]
Yeah, this is a story, about a young boy wishin for glory
Rap, riches and glory
Some people I'll love to share it with
Yeah my people my thugs I'll share it with
You can't eat through this love I'm dealing with
You can't see through this love I'm dealing with
You can't be through or eat through this love I'm dealing with
It's real I'm feeling it, my niggas, caps peel I'm killing it
Rap's real I'm realing it, all men like fishermen
Say (hey, hey, hey baby)
Yeah, drive sticks while sticking 'em
Young chicks I'm dicking 'em all down, and yeah they all down
But why it gotta be like this?
Why every girl I meet gotta be like this? Let it rain

[Chorus: singer]
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall... baby
(I know you wishing it would rain)
Nights like this I wish
That rain drops would fall...
