[Intro - Juelz]
Get money people
Do what you do
We was born to lose, but built to win, ya dig?
Reagan Era

[Hook - Juelz]
These are the days of our lives
Like coke, they want us to straight drop
But we rise (hands up) We just trying to get by
They wanna see us broke, But they won't, we on the grind
They wanna see us fall, but we ball out of control
Living above law, so fuck em all, (I said)
They wanna see us fall, but we ball out of control
So fuck em all (fuck em)

[Verse 1 - Juelz]
I was tought never stop, till the money comes
Now look ya boy life sweeter than a honey bun
Don't think I mean sweet like sweeties, I amputate you niggas
I'm diabetes, and I get the girls wet like bikinis
Squirt like a uzi on a hot like Jacuzzi water
Waiter bring me another drink for me and my niggas
We made it through another week and that's Bantom
We just trying to get by, trying to make it to the top
But the mountain so high, Good thing I know how to rock climb
Swinging over you niggas, like monkeys, I find vines
My rhymes crush grapes, fine wine, Yes boy
I'm out my mind, It's be a billionaire, or die trying
And I stay higher than a high fly, Can I get a high five?
You see the dollas bitch I float em, if float em
Got the boy lookin like he got Christmas ornaments on him, ya dig?
And my cars are imported, want it, The whips are foreign
They want them deported, I'm a die hard rockstar, if ya looking for birds
I know where the flocks are, Money long, so I know where the cops are
And I stay in a chick buns, I'm a hot dog

[Hook - Juelz]
These are the days of our lives
Like coke, they want us to straight drop
But we rise (hands up) We just trying to get by
They wanna see us broke, But they won't, we on the grind
They wanna see us fall, but we ball out of control
Living above law, so fuck em all, (I said)
They wanna see us fall, but we ball out of control
So fuck em all (fuck em)

[Verse 2 - Juelz]
Yea, I mean that to the fullest
Nobody wearing diapers but they want us doing pullups
Want us doing push ups in a yard full of niggas
We just out trying to feed a squall for the niggas
Shoutout to my squall full of niggas
This is for the hood, I'm nuttin without ya niggas
Look like the tide, we rise high
They wanna see us broke like the levys but they won't, we level 5
And like..pedal bikes, I pedal bye, Right by ya, niggas can't flatten my..tire
That's why I stay high, So high, sky's the limit
But you can touch the moon if you try
Now the moon's mine, Basically what I'm saying is
You could be the sun but my moon blocks your shine
You can be the 1 but the 2 spot is mine
Do what you do, I don't mind waiting in line (now)
Knowing I'm not far behind, it's cool (cool)
Patience is a virtue (yes) I do it big for my niggas that can't
Niggas that got caught in the rain and left damp (wet)
For my niggas treating jail like camp, this song is a peice
Of mail Santana sent (yea)
So holla at me if you got my letter, I'm signing off hope you got my letter (dipset)
