[Intro]
Day by day I'm just losin' it
Could it be I'm losing my love?
Could it be I'm losing my love?
Could it be I'm losing my love?
Could it be I'm losing my love?

[Verse 1]
Okay people, welcome me back
It's been a hell of a year, but I'm healthy and back
Long time no see, huh? Where I been, where I be, huh?
In the street, huh
Now I'm back to ride this horsey like, "Yee-ha!"
Yee-ha yee-ha, giddy up now
To the sound of the touchdown, A!
I just scored a touchdown, yay!
And I sit in a déjà, twisting the hay-ja
I don't listen to rap, I listen to 'dre, I listen to "Hey Ya"
I'm one hell of a fly, hell of a guy, who better than I?
Nobody, I'mma tell you that
And believe me, I never did lie, so

[Hook]
Could it be I'm losing my love? (For this rap shit)
Could it be I'm losing my love? (Man, I've had it)
Could it be I'm losing my love? (For this rap shit)
Could it be I'm losing my love? (Damn, I've had it)

[Verse 2]
Y'all labels got it all confused, kid
I'm not at all amused with
The boring music y'all approving, it's all some bullshit
Seems that y'all amused with
Everything that got to do with party music
Well, I ain't in a damn partying mood
But we could still party too
Just clap!
C'mon clap!
So steaming hot, believe or not, can't seem to stop, nope
Til the day I get leaned and popped
My breathing heart beating stop, so

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I might as well keep puffing my weed
Like this shit just means nothing to me
And I'm what I call "G's", y'all what I call "fleas"
Y'all what I call "sucker emcees"
So, all y'all sucker emcees, come along please, class is startin'
Everybody raise your #2 pencil up! Now lay your #2 pencil down!
And that's your career, after a year, so glad that I'm here
So glad to be here, after a year, but I've had it to here
With all this faking rap, shaking this, you faking that
Homeboy, you are fake and wack. So please stop faking, jack

[Hook]
