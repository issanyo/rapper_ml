[Intro]
Yeah, c'mon
Y'all can't fuck with me, man
Let's do it, I got this

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great
Bandana his face, blam hammers then skate, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Holla at your boy, OH!, holla at your boy, OH!

[Verse 1]
Uh, y'all know what crack sound like homie
Or what the MAC sound like when it's strapped on me
Please back off me
'Fore this MAC that's strapped on me, gets snatched off me
Cocked back used to crash your homies (OH!)
Y'all can't fuck with me man, I guarantee man
It's Santana the rap He-Man
Y'all Skeletors get your melons torched
When this weapon start letting off (OH!)
Santana no, don't hurt 'em, don't squirt 'em
Don't let the nine burn 'em in the sternum
They don't wanna go to war with ya
They ain't ready to bang or go to war with ya
So leave 'em alone, don't feed 'em the chrome
Y'all labels that stopped watching me
I tried to tell you before, I was ready, I was always hot property
Now look, I'm Diplomat slash ROC property
Stash rocks probably, fucka, you're not stopping me (OH!)

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great
Bandana his face, blam hammers then skate, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Holla at your boy, OH!, holla at your boy, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great
Bandana his face, blam hammers then skate, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Holla at your boy, OH!, holla at your boy, OH!

[Verse 2]
I'm so.. gangsta, there's no one just like me
Smooth thug will Pretty Tony your wifey
So you better keep your bitch away
'Cause I will get her number
Call her up, make her my bitch today (OH!)
Y'all can't fuck with the Great
Santana, bandana, get rid of clips and weight (OH!)
Hammers will split your face
Shift your waist, to a different place, holla at me (OH!)
Next thing you know, I'm in a different state
Back next month, new whip, different plate
Damn, Santana delivery the raw
Delivery the four, for sure man, I did it before
So, if your bitch is a whore, don't fight for her
Don't waste your life for her, trying to make it right for her
With all that fronting you're doing, and stunting you're doing
I'll shoot the pump while you moving
And shut you from moving (OH!)

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great
Bandana his face, blam hammers then skate, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Holla at your boy, OH!, holla at your boy, OH!

[Verse 3]
Y'all niggas don't ride like I do
Slide through in that 7-4-5 blue, right beside who? Killa
Where Jones? In the pick-up truck
Yeah, we use that to pick up stuff, pick up bucks
And my Denali is often parked, inside my condo
How much did he sign fo'?
(OH!) I bet you wanna know that money
Yeah I bet you I won't show that money
I keep it stashed away, right next to the fo'-fo', money
Keep a lo-pro money, this is slo-mo money, shit
I'm used to that fast crack, bag crack
Re-cook, bag that, give it out, half that
If it still bags, that's that
No more running back to me, coming back to me
I'm on the corner with a hundred packs of these
(Shit, I got this, let's do this, OH!)

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great
Bandana his face, blam hammers then skate, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Holla at your boy, OH!, holla at your boy, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great
Bandana his face, blam hammers then skate, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Uh-oh, it's Santana the Great, OH!
Holla at your boy, OH!, holla at your boy, OH!
