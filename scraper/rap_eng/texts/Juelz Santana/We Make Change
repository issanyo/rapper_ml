[Verse 1 - Cam'ron]
I'm official nice, y'all niggas Fisher Price
Fuck trout, you bout? Let's fish for ice
This a wrist of light, get it right, a vicious price ($50,000)
Plus my kicks are Nik', this what the bitches like
Like your bitchin' wife and sister might get tonight
Mister right, kiss her right, make sure that her lips get wiped
She don't suck nothing, buzzen, but she lick it nice
She a hummer - nah, plumber - she could "twist the pipes"
When I was 15, bang-bang, I called my moms'
Cell, she snorting long....that don't even correspond
All the Ganj all is gone, just came from Autobahn
Came back with the foreign Palm (I'll holla!)Shit, before I go berserk, jerk, when I sold it hurt
Urf told me go to school: nah, bitch, go to work! (Get a job!)
And gave the coldest smirk
Right after she stole my work (Where you going with my shit?!)
And the nerve to hold her purse (I'll holla!)

We make change yay, we slang yay
It sound like merengue, like "ay ay ay ay ay"
[Cam]
And we crazy, homes
.380, homes
To your baby's dome: bang bang bang bang boom!
[Juelz]
And we bomb like "La Bamba"
With bamba, send bombers to bomb ya
With bombs in their bombers
[Cam]
And the ladies, they lay me, they crazy
They love me, they hate me, like (ay ay ay ay ay!)

[Verse 2 - Cam'ron]
Ok, here come the rundown
Niggas gonna run down, tell you put your gun down
Puff puff puff, shutdown Uptown
In the house, holla back
Going round, dunn clown
I'mma do this fast or slow
When I rap or when I bag a O, when I wrap that
Pass that, catch back, fast that
Motherfuckers had to know
Oh, oh, I'm about that cornbread
Believe me, I'm beyond dead
I do this for blood shed, do it for Bloodshed
Derek Michael Armstead
Me and him soul-to-soul
If you bowl your fold, better slow your role
Before your roll get popped
And them hoes them hop from pole to pole

Lemme slow it up (why?)
So y'all can cope n' touch
I'm heroin and sex in one: dope as fuck
I'm hoping I'm ropin' the Trojan
And goin' a-hoin', "open it up"
If not, dogg, I'm choking the slut
Am I poking or what? You got to figure, dogg
The game and a chicken wing, stupid "figure four"
I'm that nigga y'all - I just ball
Best-dressed, dress fresh, oh yes yes y'all
