[Juelz Santana]- Intro
C'mon, Yo Rell, we missed you while you was gone man
But you came home just in time, its Dipset season again
Its time to go off

[Hell Rell]
So Gangsta, So Thug
Rap Game, Sewed Up
Sold Guns, Sold Drugs
(juelz) Hell Rell, Hold up!

[Juelz Santana]
I sold crack, I am crack
I am back, bet stacks
Everything you niggas lack
I give back with the mack

[Hell Rell]
I've been realer, you racoons
I'm chinchilla, i send killas
To your crib, with 10 milla's
You're nobody, We're them niggas

[Juelz Santana]

That's true, That's right
What's new, That's life
Deal with it, fact is
Real niggas, is still Dip

[Hell Rell]
It's my world, It's my rules
My guns, My jewels
Both great, You won't pay?
You want war?...O-kayyyyyy..

Black Truck, Big Goons
Full Clips, Full moons
I rise, They fall
I win, they lose

[Juelz Santana]
Stay tuned, this is
Just a preview, of what we do
What we bring you, Dipset
When you see us picture
He's so fresh, Oh yes, Coke stretch, Oh yes
Mix it, i'll whip it, its counter-clock-wise to the mack
