I move, I move the damn thing
I move the damn thing
I move, I move the damn thing

I move, I move the damn thing
I'ma-, I'ma have that ho swallowin' coke

[Juelz Santana]

I wake up and head straight for the kitchen
You would think I'm making beats, all this bass in this kitchen
I'm tony the tiger, frosted flakes in the kitchen
My bitches bag up for a living
Yeah those my BNA's
Butt Naked Assistants
And they keep the house smelling good like incense
And I know niggas wanna run up in my entrance
But big guns keep the dogs out like fences
Trespass here but there's no exits
Just a bunch of niggas in red ready to set-trip
Boy you ever seen that Heckler & Koch cop
Make a nigga head lift, then drop
And all my bitches that's down is so fine
They can swallow coke lines and follow road signs
(Ya dig?)
To get from point A to point B
Point C is me!
Where that cash at?

Ok
I got it on Monday
I was too busy Tuesday
I opened it on Wednesday
By Thursday I was moving
Friday it was gone by the weekend I was cruising
Peak into the alley, watch them shoot it like a movie
Monday comes back and I just redo it
The letters are OG, I ain't tryin' GQ it
Terminator guns, I just T2 it
My eyes are like bullets and I can see to it
And I'm in the kitchen when they're ain't no ham
Just me and these 28 grams
Now step aside, let me demonstrate man
You got to cut it while it's hot
Or you end up with a block
And if you end up with a block
That's when you end up with a block
That is no longer street
That is now my shop
Stubborn ass coke, sit down in my pot
Every time I turn the fire up
It just rise to the top
