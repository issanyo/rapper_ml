[Verse 1 - Jim Jones]
Ayo my Dip Set Taliban, we are not a crew
We're more like a movement, more like in tune with
The moon and the stars
Some say I'll soon be doomed for them bars
But I could be caught - pissy clubs
Saloons and some bars
Industry think that they grooming a star - nah
I'm more like a thug misproving the odds
Run around my city all crazy
With my goons in some cars

[Bridge - Cam'ron]
I tell 'em
Wake up, wake up
Gotta go get that cake up, break up
Divide that payroll, ayo
Go get that yayo, yayo
Killa, paper, holla at Pedro
On the 8-0 and wait for my son, the lay low
Ba' bro

[Cam'ron]
When I beef, names will be said, tool will be spread
Two in your head, body be bagged, eulogy read
Dog in the news will get read
Cause what I deal with is usually feds
On the first

[Hook]
Ayo, ayo, ayo, ayo
It's the first of the month
Yayo yayo! Yayo yayo!
It's the first of the month

[Verse 2 - Juelz Santana]
Now I'm the type of dude
Post up, sell drugs on your property
Stone cold hustler, ain't no fucking denying me
I sell drugs in varieties: You want it? I got it
You see it, you like it
We count it, you buy it from me
I'm what the people call a "menace to the public society"
Fuck 'em I'm riding, my gun on the side of me
Fuck it, I'm driving, I'm puffing, high as can be
I'm speeding, I'm weaving
I'm bugging, my eye on the street
Cam signed to the Roc, it's time that we eat
Harlem's back, this time it's for keeps
You rolling or not?
The Takeover's now, y'all focused or not?
We been ready it's just that our promotion was not
But I can't blame no one for this, I'm all right with that
Can't be racist cause I sell too much white for that
So I decided I'mma milk these crackers
For all their milk and crackers
Until I'm rich and these mills don't matter
You niggas follow my plot?
If not, swallow these shots, Santana swallow your block
I run with enforcers, big dudes and bosses
Black, British and Walter, the phone call will cost ya'
Keep rolling in them caravans acting
We got big trucks with chrome Taliban action
Send one up to Jabar, my nigga maxed in
T-Money's home and he's never going back in

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Cam'ron]
Aiyo, I swear to God, you think I had a violin the way I fiddle triggers
How you older than me and still a little nigga?
On the first, I hate these chickens
Get their check, hair, nails done
Steak and chicken for the fridge
And their kids fly.. I ain't open, friend
On the 11th, you gonna be broke again
Word to Jehova man, hoes in they shoes
Barking like a Doberman
Coming to see Cam for some coke again

[Jim Jones]
Shit, it's the first of the month
Yo, I'm the first on the block for the cycle
A rock that is first like shoots from a rifle
See they tainted our image
It's fucked up how the game painted our image
They say we dangerous people
Why? Because we sell caine to the people
That don't be the reason I be aiming this eagle, my aims to get equal
The first and fifteenth's got some restraints on my people
