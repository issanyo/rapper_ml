[Intro]
It's Santana, holla at ya boy
Ay Weezy you got me?
I'm bout to take it to these niggas real HD
Real high definition
Ya digg?
Aye!

[Verse]
Sling dope, sling coke, sling pot
Whatever you niggas want I got
Come get it
But I prefer to stand over the same pot
Mix the soda with the coca whip over the same rock, yes
Cars clothes and bankrolls, can't stop
Bank close, I chase hoes? I think not
They chase me you ain't know? I sling cock
I give it to 'em the right way, they stay hot
I break walls, keep em comin' like rainfalls
She take dick, take it all til' she can't walk
She take balls take it all til' she can't talk
I bang her off bang the four til' it's taped off
People gather round like "damn who the tape for?"
Cameras on they like "damn who the tape for?"
Me, it's $59.95 you gotta pay for it
You seen Menace and how O-Dog did it
Well I'm a menace like O-Dog with it, don't y'all get it?
Y'all pussy cats I know y'all kittens
If we was young and it got cold I woulda stole y'all mittens
Now I might just steal y'all ladies
Send her home with a mouth full of stillborn babies
You chumps been lunch meat
My dogs love munching on lunch meat
Here boy, come eat
