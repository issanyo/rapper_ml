[LiL' Wayne:]
I tell em' da bitch ride da dick like a new Honda
Wit da cops behind her im kinda
Sorta watcha calla'
Superstar now some on tryin fuck some superstars mouth
Straight up and the guns come wit the money
And the work come with the luggage
Fuck it
These niggas talking big wit a rapper budget
I get paid off rappers buddy
And I ain't fuckin wit da rat pack
I pull up as any day wit some tap tap
And that's that

And when u runnin don't look back
Cuz im be coming out dat back pack

Money over bitches
Reporting to u motherfuckers live from da kitchen
