Nobody knows what I go through, nah
Nobody knows, facts
If you can put yourself inside my shoes, red bottoms
You got friends is not friends no more, fuck em
They don't understand this life that I chose
Get money and when the money and fame, it can hurt everything you love
That's right, I got some people that depend on me
I can't give up, don't know what I'm going through
You don't know, yeah, ah
They don't understand what I've been through
They don't understand what I go through
You think everything's all good
But you only see what I show you
They don't understand that boss life
Gotta take care of my whole crew
They depend on me my f-ckin niggas
They know the love is real and I'm a f-ckin winner
We all gonn eat, Sunday dinner
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
One day we broke together, next day we rich forever
They hate it when you up, they love it when you down
All we got is us then told my niggas look around
Look around, look around
If if I gotta be the one to lift for sup, I won't let em down
So at the top it's just us looking down
Sorry I delayed us, but we gon' get this paper
Had a couple issues, I dealt with them, now it's payback
It's like everybody got they hand out
Acting like they you owe em something
They expect you to throw em something
When they really need you to show em something
One month, every broke again
Acting like you ain't throw em none
Ungrateful ass niggas, they only love you when you giving
And the day you say you ain't got it
They forget the days that you did it
You forgot me when I was loosing
So forget me when I'm winning
Where the dark day was frenzing me
Till the day they be friend of me
One day we broke friends, next day we rich enemies
It's hard being a real nigga, when these niggas got bitch tendencies
Female emotions, I can't waste my energy
For them I got that remedy, kill em with success
Royalty is my pedigree, too fresh to be stressed
But thank god for memories, god willin I'm blessed
My comeback's they penalty, these haters gon' be upset
And I done lost a couple friends on the way
Fuck 'em they wasn't really with me all the way
I'll be okay
Nobody knows what I go through, nah
Nobody knows, facts
If you can put yourself inside my shoes, red bottoms
You got friends is not friends no more, fuck em
They don't understand this life that I chose
Get money and when the money and fame, it can hurt everything you love
That's right, I got some people that depend on me
I can't give up, don't know what I'm going through
You don't know, yeah, ah
