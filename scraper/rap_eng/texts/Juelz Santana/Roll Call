[Verse 1: T.I.]
I'mma watch you sucker niggas suffer when the heat on you
I'mma let you see what all this hating lead gon' to
And I die before speak on you
I'm a G, play around something we don't do
[?] we want to
Niggas wonder how he do it [?]
Simple I'm a vet nigga, man of respect
You a detective but you can get out [?]
I done shot dice, sold blow ran with the best
Old hoes [?] exist
Better get your [?] vest
Before you [?]
Got a partner doing life I love him to death
I wanna brang 'em home but I'm wanted for sell
Remember when we used to [?]
Talking shit, slang crack got strap with the belt
[?] with a real ass real nigga [?]
You see the Source, niggas locked up and killing theyself
Other niggas, got a million left
So all the fuck niggas walking 'round killing theyself
But I'm still found out in ATL on the grind
Still hit the trap and shine like the summer time
Rubberband bank's like I slung a bunch of dimes
For Dipset, Grand Hustle man it's up with time

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
Soldiers this is a roll call
Soldiers this is a roll call
Soldiers this is a roll call
Soldiers this is a roll call
Soldiers this is a roll call
Soldiers this is a roll call
Soldiers this is a roll call
Soldiers this is a roll call

[Verse 2]
You people

I will

The same time

Spend

Faster than Speedy Gonzales

So face it

Lethal injection, I'm the medicine
Come on people, time for medicine
