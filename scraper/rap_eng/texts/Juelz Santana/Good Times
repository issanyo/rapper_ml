You know me, yeah you niggas know me

'Member that good old fade
'Memember that good old brush, you kept in your back pocket After that good old cut
'Member them good old block parties and cookouts
Everybody on the block party and cookout
Nobody get shot during the cookout
Maybe a fight, niggas box during the cookout
Niggas laugh, shout during the cookout
"Damn! How you get knocked out during the cookout"
'Member your good old fam
'Member that one dude you could count on, ya good old man (my nigga)

As long as you had your good old Auntie
Your good old Nanny, your good ol family
Yup..
