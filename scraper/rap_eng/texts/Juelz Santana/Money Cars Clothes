We getting to the money, what the fuck you doing? Nothing
If you ain't getting money then you fuckin stupid
Riding round smoking Keisha nigga cashin out
Sboe, only thing we care about is
Money, cars, money, hoes
Money, hoes, money, clothes
Money, cars, money, hoes
Money, hoes, money, clothes

[Verse 1]
Big faces in my pocket, bigger faces on my rollie
Big dunk on my hip and the hood niggas they know me
Versace's on my face, match my gold Jordan lace
Sboe nigga I start my own gang
Pussy nigga don't fuck around, talking money ain't adding up
Garbage bags attached, in the back seat of that lambo truck
36's and 24's, yeah nigga, that's cold
Break em down and bring em back
101 all off the track
They say we getting money, well nigga that's an understatement
We been getting this money, 7 summers they straight hating
5 whips, paper plating, whole crew, damn badies
Still grinding, paper chasing, d boy, day paytin

[Hook]
We getting to the money, what the fuck you doing? Nothing
If you ain't getting money then you fuckin stupid
Riding round smoking Keisha nigga cashin out
Sboe, only thing we care about is
Money, cars, money, hoes
Money, hoes, money, clothes
Money, cars, money, hoes
Money, hoes, money, clothes

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
45 on my hip, 45 on my wrist
2 45 for my whip, now that's what I call lick
Vegas night roulette table, lost 45 in one spin
I'm a harlem nigga, I double duck, bet 45 again
Lost that, made it right back, in a 45 minute trip
Nigga wanted to and I fronted 2, charging 45 each brick
Nigga you road boat, and I'm show boat
And you're joe rogan, I'm hulk hogan
My car foreign, next season
You jet skiing, my jet leaving
And I brought your girl with me
She a zombie, she be head eating
Wanna see a movie come see me
Fuck hd, I'm 3d
What I smoke be 1 hunned
And I'm 300 like chief keef
Screaming oh I, bang, bang, you know the drill
Overkill for that money

[Hook]
We getting to the money, what the fuck you doing? Nothing
If you ain't getting money then you fuckin stupid
Riding round smoking Keisha nigga cashin out
Sboe, only thing we care about is
Money, cars, money, hoes
Money, hoes, money, clothes
Money, cars, money, hoes
Money, hoes, money, clothes

[Verse 3]
Tats all on my arm, money all in my pocket
Keep your bitch from round me, I be plugging hoes like sockets
And my louie belt and my newdy jeans
Horseshoes I'm truly clean
Turn this shit to a movie scenee
And my team we do this thing
We do right like spike lee
Double g's on that white t
Double cup of that sprite lean
Bitch say she don't like me
Probably cause she dikin, flow cold like ice age
Go hard like vycan, just ballin like Michael
Fresh pair of them jays, getting money 4 ways
20 racks in her rack, yeah they faker than tupe
Catch me rolling them planes, taking off like jet blue
With a model bitch off that runway
I make her take off like jets do

[Hook]

If you ain't getting money then you fuckin stupid
Riding round smoking Keisha nigga cashin out

Money, cars, money, hoes
Money, hoes, money, clothes
