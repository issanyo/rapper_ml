[Intro: Drake]
I was-I was in Atlanta with 40
And I was like, man
Just make me some Dipset, Heatmakerz shit
Heatmakerz
Crack music

[Break: Jim Jones]
Uh huh
We strike again
Harlem, what's up?

[Verse 1: Jim Jones]
I put it on for my hood when they wanted to off me (Facts)
Lawyers on retainers, man, them fuckers was costly (Fetti)
Put it in that bag, what the fuck could it cost me? (Fuck that)
In the hood with all my jewels, who the fuck could extort me? (Skrt-skrt)
Never said nothin’ when they cuffed and they caught me (Shh)
Copped two when papi had a couple to toss me (¡¿Qué lo que?!)
The pump'll make 'em Jump, when the fuckers Kris Kross me (Ya hear that?)
A savage wit’ them hoes, once I'm fuckin' her, all key (Missin' that)
The engine in the Porsche like they stuffed it with horsies (Skrt)
Durant scuffed my kicks outta bounds on the floor seat (Oh shit)
Shit, outta bounds in the floor seat
And, yeah, I went to school, what the fuck did it taught me? (Loco)
Man, I'm watchin' all you grown men dancin' to the Kiki (Word)
Shit, up in Harlem we was dancin' on them ki, kis (Facts)
Sixty eight and I owe you one, you gon’ pay me that fee, fee (Uh huh)
If this is the NBA, then you’d play in a D League (Fucka)

[Chorus: Trav]
It was none of they business, I had inches but they take yards (Take yards)
I got niggas in the jails to the graveyard (Graveyard)
If the judge give the bail, we gon' straight ball (Straight ball)
If papi my amigo, we gon’ take off (We gon' take off)
Got to stay chill, stay down and stay loyal (Loyal)
'Cause in this game, these niggas don't have no morals (No morals)
Niggas stay down, stay trill and stay loyal (Stay loyal)
’Cause in this game these niggas don't have no morals
Niggas stay trill

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
What'chu know about bustin' moves in the freezin' cold?
Turnin' down sales just to keep it whole
Why break it down when my connect want me to flip the load?
That's like settlin' for silver when you gettin' gold (Don't)
Small money on the breakdown, believe it though
I'm more concerned with the risk, I'm tryna keep it low (Low)
Peter pay Paul, if not, they gettin' pita rolled (Yeah)
Young Rondo with the give and go (Go)
I was always thinkin' upper echelon (Uh)
They was thinkin' Nino Brown, I'm thinkin' Pablo Escobar (Yeah)
No disputin' what the truth is (Nah)
They was more Nicky Barnes, I was more Frank Lucas (Ha)
They was thinkin' like Bishop, I was thinkin' like Q on the roof
Never cared about the Juice (Never)
Only cared about the points and the score
So every time I shoot, it's like swoosh (Swoosh, swoosh)

[Chorus: Trav]
It was none of they business, I had inches but they take yards (Take yards)
I got niggas in the jails to the graveyard (Graveyard)
If the judge give the bail, we gon' straight ball (Straight ball)
If papi my amigo, we gon' take off (We gon' take off)
Got to stay chill, stay down and stay loyal (Loyal)
'Cause in this game, these niggas don't have no morals (No morals)
(Dipset, nigga)
Niggas stay down, stay trill and stay loyal (Stay loyal)
(Dipset, nigga)
'Cause in this game these niggas don't have no morals
Niggas stay trill

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Dame Dash my man, he shootin' then I'm buckin' with him (Pop, pop, pow!)
They shootin' at us? Shit, I'm duckin' with him (Yo, look out!)
But I had to be firm and tell him
That Kanye only fuck wit'chu when no one else is fuckin' with him (That's a fid-act, fid-act)
He told me he was bipolar (What, nigga?)
I looked and said, "Bipolar?" (Come on, now)
Don't be ridiculous, he wasn't in the mix with us (Nope)
Bricks from Hamilton Terrace
He didn't take the risk with us (Not at all)
Ain't boil a coffee pot, ain't open the barber shop
Where we sold hydro at, where we pissed off the cops (G-O-D)
The ones in the Taurus, nigga, he a tourist (Yup)
Uncle Tom nigga know nothin' 'bout this chorus (Dipset, nigga)

[Chorus: Trav]
It was none of they business, I had inches but they take yards (Take yards)
I got niggas in the jails to the graveyard (Graveyard)
If the judge give the bail, we gon' straight ball (Straight ball)
If papi my amigo, we gon' take off (We gon' take off)
Got to stay chill, stay down and stay loyal (Loyal)
'Cause in this game, these niggas don't have no morals (No morals)
Niggas stay down, stay trill and stay loyal (Stay loyal)
'Cause in this game these niggas don't have no morals
Niggas stay trill
