[Hook]
Who that mothafucka all up in my window?
He want the lineman, end up in the end zone
Ocho Cinco, all my mami's Ocho Cinco
Oye mami, ya tu sabe, yo soy lindo
Who that mothafucka all up in my window?
He want the lineman, end up in the end zone
Ocho Cinco, all my mami's Ocho Cinco
Oye mami, ya tu sabe, yo soy lindo

[Verse 1]
Oye, oye
Okay okay, que lo que
My niggas getting money
What 'bout them? Yo no se
Might pull up on your bitch
Ven aqui andale
She don't fuck with you cause you underpaid
And I got money busting out the fucking safe
And I run with them young niggas that'll bust your face
Still got a couple girls that stash it in they chocha
They get bagged, they know the rules, callate la boca
All of my niggas is solid, valid
Money keep coming and piling
And I got the keys, I got the keys
No, I ain't talking 'bout Khaled
She want a dame besito
Mami know papi que lindo
She know I got mucho dinero
Said she wanna chupo mi huevo

[Hook]
Who that mothafucka all up in my window?
He want the lineman, end up in the end zone
Ocho Cinco, all my mami's Ocho Cinco
Oye mami, ya tu sabe, yo soy lindo
Who that mothafucka all up in my window?
He want the lineman, end up in the end zone
Ocho Cinco, all my mami's Ocho Cinco
Oye mami, ya tu sabe, yo soy lindo
