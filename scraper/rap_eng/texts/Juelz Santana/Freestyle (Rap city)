I got diamonds dripping off me, Carats and stones
Lookin' like I just left Sierra Leone
And my money gettin' heavy puttin' calories on
You fools just carrying on, F'em
They all watch me, They all copy
My flows﻿ past murder, It's autopsy
What are you senseless? This forensics
I don't spit, I throw up my intestines
And with the money I'm reckless, relentless
I'm in the mall spendin what you call a pension
Girls with horse legs, I ride'em like a western
I give'em extra time, I'm detention
I'm a samurai up in'em, Y'all fencing
The flow sicker than anything you could mention
I wasn't born, I﻿ was sketched, then invented
A lab test gone bad, I'm the invention
It's for respect, Y'all hustlin' for a check
I'm paid, Thomas Edison's on my neck
Light blubs, I sink con-edison checks
Ya dig, ya dig, ya dig
Don't be mad at me
Smile for your majesty
I'm so bright
The sun wanna battle me
My neck look like it's from another galaxy
My wrists﻿ look like I bought the whole gallery
Watcha know about that hard case Louis box
I open it up, it looks like a jewelry shop
