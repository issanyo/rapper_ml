Harlem breed niggas who ball
So understand it wasn't a choice for me
And I ain't never stoppin at all
I rep Harlem forever man, ever man, ever man
From Jewelry on down to the car
It's all about catchin a stunt for me
They hate the way I pull up and floss
I rap this shit forever man ever man...
First name Forever last name Harlem
Roca park flow, let em' know don't guard em'
How could you compare those mothaf*ckin' weirdos
To a nigga like me when they swaggas on zero
Here I come to save the day, super hero
Pocket on casino, Robert DeNiro
In my town, niggas slinging pounds, kilo's
Cars paid in full, so they never get repoed
Niggas throwing dice against the wall, CeeLo
This is my movie, you an extra, B-role
Your girl insist I got a very big... Ego
I'm here to take the game from these lames, Deebo
And I got chips, cheese, dorito's
And I get in your ass, no homo, speedo's
Bitches like me cause they really think I'm cute to them
Bitches like you cause of the things you could do to them
Bitches like me because I f*ck em till the cum
And bitches like you because your money make em cummm
Forgot it, ain't tricking if you got it
But guess what bitch I ain't tricking and I got it
But you could hit the strip and we could start splitting the profit
Got it
Difference between me and them guys
They get fly, I am fly
Harlems in me
Harlems in me
Harlems in me
Family's headed up town
All white uptowns
If I had to change my last name they could call me Mr Uptown
Fords just dropped so you know we get the Pelle's
Take the fly girls to Juelz to the tele's
I'm a vampire, True Blood like Sookie (suu woo)
Know niggas that die for this shit Tookie
Niggas be acting like bitches pussy
So we turn the whole situation ugly whoopee
I be on 15's nini b with me
Don't care if you blind you can see we be drippy (bling)
Haunted by Harlem
Dreams so richie and you know we keep the fix if the fiends get itchy
Itchy, please get with me
Got niggas in Queens you can even ask 50
The credit scammer's the heavy gamblers
And my young niggas walk around with heavy blammers
Damn, I'm fly
