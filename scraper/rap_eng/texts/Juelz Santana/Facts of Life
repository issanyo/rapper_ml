[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Lemme see you do this
C'mon, lemme tell you about the facts of life

[Hook: Theme song from "Facts of Life"]
You take the good, you take the bad
You take 'em both and there you have
The facts of life, the facts of life
You take the good, you take the bad
You take 'em both and there you have
The facts of life, the facts of life

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Ayo I tried to take the good, I tried to take the bad
I tried to take 'em both man, look what I have - nothin'
Look what I'm stuck with, dirty streets corrupted
Nothin' to do but sell drugs to the public - fuck it
I'm on these corners hustlin' eighths of crack
From the day to the night, to the day come back
And these hoes'll try to get you for cribs and get you for loot
Stick you with kids you didn't produce
Sorry lady, but I'm just spittin' the truth
Yeah I know niggas do creep shit too - fuck 'em
See it's a fact niggas is dogs
Just like it's a fact that if I can't rap
I'm in the kitchen whippin' the raw
Gettin' it hard on the corners, dishin' it off
Hopin the cops never catch me and ship me up north
The hustle's inside me, no one or nothin' can guide me
I'm stuck in this lobby with crack
That's my life, that's the facts, c'mon

[Hook: Theme song from "Facts of Life"]
You take the good, you take the bad
You take' em both and there you have
The facts of life, the facts of life
You take the good, you take the bad
You take 'em both and there you have
The facts of life, the facts of life

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
Killa, facts of life, facts of life, facts of life
I got a ROC habit, I copped carats, how could I not have it?
Ice drippin' down my neck, even the lock lavish
But my most prized possession - cop badges
That I got from a scuffle with these cop bastards
I unlock handcuffs, I cock 'matics
I don't wanna talk to y'all if ya not addicts
I'm not average, my old school, stop passed it
Seen my principal, showed off my fox fabric
No hard feelings though sir, got passed it
See y'all failed me in math but I got passed it
Guns, credit cards, dog - got plastic
When I floss in the street, man I stop traffic
You should stop, cherish and pay homage
How I got cabbage I tell you I love you ma, it's not marriage
But L with the speech you spit
You'll have ya own beach and six and that's a fact of life

[Hook: Theme song from "Facts of Life"]
You take the good, you take the bad
You take 'em both and there you have
The facts of life, the facts of life
You take the good, you take the bad
You take 'em both and there you have
The facts of life, the facts of life

You take the good, you take the bad
You take 'em both and there you have
The facts of life, the facts of life
You take the good, you take the bad
You take 'em both and there you have
The facts of life, the facts of life

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Yo, now you could catch me holla'n at every bitch walkin' my way like "Hey"
Ma, you feel like talkin today?
My name is Juelz, I promise I will feed you the ice
If anything I'll teach you, I lead you through life
I'll tell you not to go down that alleged street path
I'll keep you from the losers and deadbeat dads
I'm just tryna live the facts of my life
But I realized, yo it's just a few facts in my life
This rap, this mic, this pack I got strapped in my Nikes
Damn my ankle hurt, these straps is too tight

[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
I know just how it is dog, I'm still pitchin'
Right around the corner from Bill Clinton
Beef and broccolis on, you know the grill chickens
You need sixteen, Cam is down
How you want it - rhymes, O's, grams or pounds?
Come though ban-damn it down
Put cha hammers down, from now on its Santana's town

[Verse 5: Juelz Santana]
You take the coke, you take the bake
You shake and scrape and there you have
The crack and light, the crack and light
You hit the block with the rock, watch for cops and there you get
The stacks in life, stacks in life
Mommy always said "Will you ever grow up"
I think I'll never grow up, I think I'd rather blow up
Cause I love to run the streets, chasin' ladies, gettin' money
That's a matter of fact, life's a matter of fact
Cause when you livin' up to ya dreeaamms
I'll show what my hood's about, I'll tell you what my hood's about
When you livin' up to ya dreeaamms
I'll show what my hood's about, I'll tell you what my hood's about
