[Intro]
"What's that? A gun?"
"I got a gun, he got a gun
He got a gun, everybody got guns!"

[Juelz Santana]
Nigga, where the fuck I be nigga
You niggas won't last
Bang bang, shoot 'em right now gang nigga

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Count to sixteen, that's how many in my nine clip (shoot 'em up)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Now count to fifty, that's how many in the semi nigga (shoot 'em-shoot 'em up)
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
Count to one-hundred, I won't stop, yeah that's how many in the chopper
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em-shoot 'em up
Shoot 'em up, shoot 'em up

[Juelz Santana]
Uh, still riding dirty (dirty), won't catch me slipping
Strapped up shorty (shorty), big nose like Pippen
Racked up shorty (shorty), big dough I'm gettin'
Presidential Rollie (Rollie), my wrist Richard Nixon
Twenty grand on hammers, they drove in from Richmond
Lord forgive my past, but these streets ain't forgiven
I'm from a place where these niggas don't play
Everybody got guns, even killers ain't safe
Real niggas die young, for me that won't be the case
I'll let murder be my case 'for I let 'em see the day
No mercy for these niggas, but I pray for these boys
Let them choppers make noise, sad day for your boys
Shoot 'em up

[Hook]

[Bounce]
Still sleep with that forty, in case I hear 'em coming
Gotta wake up and get 'em off me, big nigga ain't running
Wanted nigga, I'm gunning, gotta keep that on me
Don't know none of y'all pussy niggas, ain't none of y'all my homie
Bang bang, shoot 'em up, gang nigga we bangin'
I'm riding 'round in that 'Rari, that MAC-11 I'm sprayin'
Want your bitch cause she playing, yeah baby we winnin'
Come hit the club, we threw thirty bottles, you can see the cash that we spendin'
Who the fuck said I was pimping? Nah baby just listen
S.B.O.E. bitch we get money, no limit
They start shit and we end it, and we don't stop til they finished
And we still T.C.B. bitch, we taking care of bid'ness

[Hook]

[Juelz Santana]
Shoot 'em-shoot 'em up {*echoes*}
