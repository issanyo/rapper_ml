Hot damn, ho, here we go again, (yeah)

(Chorus: Juelz Santana + (Fabolous))
We can't drink or smoke (uh uh), We can't eat or joke, (uh uh)
If we ain't gettin' it on, so what's it gonna be
I ain't tryin' to go there with you, (uh uh)
I ain't even tryin' to go there with you (uh uh, uh uh)

(Verse 1: Juelz Santana)
The boy's back in the building, yes I iiiiis
OK, OK, OK, Yes I iiiiis
Oh he didn't, No he didn't
Oh, oh, yes I diiiiid, ay!
How 'bout that big 'ol thing, in that big 'ol mink
Like my shit don't stink, Yes I did
And them hoes know how I get on down
I'm like, ho, is you down, now come and get on down
But I can't stay and grind, I can't waste the time
If we ain't gettin' it on, So what's it gonna be
Is we crushin' or not, chick, is you suckin' this rock dick
'Cause I'm lovin' ya hot tits, (yep!)
If not I must go, I must split, I must leave
Grab my pants and my phone plus weed (aaand)
I won't leave a damn thing behind, not a damn piece of shine
Not a damn bit of money, just a damn piece of mine, ay!

(Chorus: Juelz Santana + (Fabolous))
We can't drink or smoke, we can't eat or joke
If we ain't gettin' it on, so what's it gonna be
I ain't tryin' to go there with you
I ain't even tryin' to go there with you (no! no!)
I can't play around, I can't stay around, (Street Fam, bitch...real life)
If we ain't gettin' it on, so what's it gonna be (quit playin' bitch, haha)
I ain't tryin' to go there with you, (come and get some of this million dollar deal)
I ain't even tryin' to go there with you (uh uh, uh uh)

(Verse 2: Fabolous)
I like the way you make it shake, ma (shake, ma)
The sexy faces that you make, ma (make, ma)
Makin' me do what it take, ma (take, ma)
To make you come and pet the snake, ma (snake, ma)
And I'm carryin' a python, scary when the mic's on, (uh)
And I walk around with them canaries and them whites on, (woo!)
Light up the club, when they barely got the lights on, (that's right)
Prolly got you thinkin' 'bout, marryin' this icon, (yeah)
I'm buryin' the bygones, (yeah) f**kin' like a pornstar
I've got niggas hookin' they hoes up to Onstar
The rich rapper, a.k.a. "The Bitchsnapper"
Who have ya baby girl held hostage in a Phantom, (oh!)
Callin' her man, sayin a nigga look so handsome, (oh!)
She gon' just stay, ain't no need to pay the ransom, (nah)
I'm on the Range's line, (uh huh) every time they change design, (uh huh)
Bitch, hurry up and get in, before I change my mind, huh?

(Bridge 2: Juelz Santana)
If you want it then nod ya head like this, (like this)
If you don't want it then nod ya head like this, (like this)
If you want it then nod ya head like this, (like this)
If you don't want it then nod ya head like this (like this)

(Verse 3: Juelz Santana)
Is we gon' get it poppin' easy, get it kinda freaky
(tell me) Or is we gon' just sit and watch some TV
(yeah? huh? what?) It's a yes or no answer
I'm not Kobe Bryant, it's a yes or no answer
I ain't here to chill, I came here for thrills
Is we gon' get it on, now what's it gonna be
Is you shakin' it all or, is you takin' it all off
I'llbe waitin' for your call, PSYCHE
I'll be waitin' for your friend, She shakin' it all man
And she takin' it off, damn, damn, damn
I do not wanna kick back, do not wanna chit chat
It's late, yes, I wanna hit that

(Chorus: Juelz Santana)
We can't drink or smoke, we can't eat or joke
If we ain't gettin' it on, so what's it gonna be
I ain't tryin' to go there with you
