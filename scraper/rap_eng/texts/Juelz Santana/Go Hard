[Intro]
And we go by the runners
(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
DJ Khaled, we the best
(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
I'm goin in, I'm goin in
I do it for the hood, cause the hood told me I should
(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
If you rep yo' hood and you goin' hard
If the they hatin' on you don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best
(I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ay)
You can't stop this
Fuck the best, we run this game
Kanye West, Khaled, and Pain

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
Cause it's in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard
I am gettin it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I go the hardest
Flow so retard
I'm disgusted with myself
I mean ughh, where do I start?
First I spin around and vomit
Then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad won't nobody get up on it, I
Flow sick, nigga how sick, sea sick
Got your hand out, don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I have some wins, some losses
Just a life of a god damn boss's
With the top off, lookin' for a girl with a ass as fat as Tracy Ross's
This is dope as it get
Dope as a mother fuckin' acid trip
Fly as 57 passengers
This finna be another classic bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it, then get at it
But I ain't gon have it
No I ain't gon have it

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure Imma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
Cause it's in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard
I am gettin it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go hard

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scared
Never been a type to bite my words
When I came up ya'll gave me shit
Now I'm finna make ya'll eat them terds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Gon' head, spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care what you felt
Fuck you nigga, I know I'm dope
Felt Like I couldn't really give it my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top, ain't no where to go now
Instead of me, she gon' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down if I knew what I know now
I'm scooby, I know I'm dumb
It could get fuckin' old, well it's good I'm young
'Fore my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one?
I guess it's gon' be what it's gon' be
But here's one thing ya'll got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck ya'll niggas, I'm out of here

[Chorus: T-Pain]
If you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure Imma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo yard
Makin money ain't shit to me
Cause it's in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, you gots to go hard
I am gettin it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go hard
