[Ace Hood]:

No one on the corner has swagger like this
Cause i'm so incredible, they not compatible to me
Eat them up like I was hannible, they cattle to a beast
Graduated from the hunger, now it's rappers that I feast
And i'm coming for each and every one of you
Said that I couldn't do now i'm swiggity-swaggin on you bums on this interview
Call it an interlude, talkin to you and the fools
Got nominated, I know they hated, they sick of dude
But if you sick and new, I feed them lames the theraflu
Get them mad, and buy a coupe, and drop the roof, adjust the cruise
Show you what the swagger do, it's on the highest altitude
They can't fit my sneakers, show the best rapper attitude
See the youngest and its on the beaches
See the features on my face, I can't erase it
Though my swagger so amazing oh
Catch me at the top, i'm throwin Big J and ocka low
Ballin like i'm Karl Malone i'm the next best, it's on


[Juelz Santana]:

There's only two men I fear when it comes to a battle
God and my shadow
Everybody else get a ravel
Tangle, mangle, totally disabled
Hung from a roof watching dangle
Then i'll make your wife feel the pain too, anal
Juelz Santana, forget those busters
The boy flow harder than Kimbo's punches
Your boys better step aside, 'fore I get it guys
You're just bugs, i'm spittin' that p-pesticide
You're not mobsters, wait, stop the fate
Or you found dead what you had in that lobster plate
Money in the bank, I benefit from my benefits
I'm makin it while i'm spendin' it
You go to the Louis store
You go to the Gucci store
You go to the mall, spend it all
What you do that for?
You can buy the rags, you can buy the bags
But there ain't no sign that say they sell swagg
But you can watch me and do your best imitation
You need a little time, a little preparation
But sooner or later, you're gonna have to face it
I'm like the penthouse, you're a fixed up basement
As far as chicks go, I get it you take it
I give them more flakes, they call me Mathis


[Fabolous]:

Yeah, do it, it don't matter
Upper come on has beat
I'm in your ass B, who's the next raz beat?
Word playing king, i'm not the one to scrabble with
The rocks got more carrots in it than rabbit shit
Yeah, and after these airlines
You might see why, lie, I need a deal signs
Cause everybody coming in and yeah it's failing
That's why they need to blame Sarah Palin
I'd rather be in Maui, para sailing
Cause when you wanna lead, you don't care we trailing
So get you're little money, you isn't a threat
And we's making it rain, you wasn't drizzling yet
Right meach, death before the sauna
The swaggers like mine cause I left it on the corner
So fly gotta shop at the sky mall
And this time i'm gonna get more drops than eyeballs
Los


[Jadakiss]:

I'll tell you this once, hip hop is not dead
Change gon' come just like Barack said
Money, power, respect, like the lock said
You'll be the man of the house, my pops said
Heat the streets up right quick, it's all time and
Gucci everything, Sierra Leone diamonds
You can know so much yet, but know nothing
If I don't know nothing else, bet I know hustling
This ain't even a rhyme, this a control substance
Strictly, I ain't swinging, no tussling
I just do business, I don't do friends
Brand new M1's and 9mm's
Long as money's involved with it, i'm in
You ain't gotta second guess to best i'm him
I will wrap circles around these Irkles
Everything's digital, purps is still purple
So i'm staying in my lane til I open up
I'm like a sponge in the game, just soaking up
All gone, I deserve a hit
I know you heard it kiss, this is the cypher
I murdered it
