[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yessir, Weezy F. Baby, ya

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I thank the lord each and every day
And I'll have three blunts to sip air'y-aid
My grill looks like an iced out barricade
And I got more green than the everglades
I'm the shit, I am funky like I never bathe
Baby, I'm tryin' to do numbers like a yellow page
When I was 14 I told my ma we will see better days
And sure enough I got Ms. Cita in a better place
I fucks with Marley and Capito from the eastside
On the eastside we all blood, we all family, never Di-vide
Keep my knees high in my levi, Now, don't fuck up my de-sign
Yeah, I am big dog, big dog, barkin' at you felines
Yeah, you niggas is simple, what's a Bentley to a Nissan?
I don't fuck around by the store, but go head and get your lease sign
Yeah, go head, add another finger to the peace sign, that's the W and B sign, bitch


Yeah, ya' understands me, Mack they gonna' respect me

[Hook](x2)
Cause I'm a rider, I'm just another mothafuckin southsider
I'm on that syurp, so I act a 'lil tired
And everybody sippin', baby, I'm a rider
And everybody with me


[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
(Haha)
Money over everything, except blood
For money I do everything; shed blood
Spill blood, kill 'ya
Fo sho paper, you get slow'mo paper
They say my money fuckin' up the ozone layer (Woah)
I got yacht money, you got robo' paper
Told ya, my money waver tip yo' robo ova (Ova')
I let the gats flare (Yep), quicker than the mac flare (Yep)
I hear ya' pussies need a pap-smear, haha, yeah
So come follow this (Come), gun-dermatologist (Me)
One gun by the hip (Uh-oh), show you how the Poppa's sit (Pop, pop, pop)
Believe me, my bullets bite with a lobster grip (Damn)
And trust me, I know how to fish (Gotcha'), Boy
And I feel like a shark on his worst day (Move)
Cause you're just a little mermaid
I got that promethazine flow (What's that?), Slow
They can't fuck with me (Nope)
Let's go, come'on

Dipset, you know what it is, Santana, ay', ye'dig, all right, Dipset bitch
