Daddy?
Daddy?

Daddy? (just to hear you breathing)
Damn man this shits crazy
Got a little son now, little me
Runnin' around, its crazy
I'd do anything man, do anything
Life is precious, remember that

And if I die then my child'll be a bastard

I just had a newborn
Shorty weighs 7 pounds, 6 ounces, 20 inches, too strong
I'm happy now, I'm a daddy now
I gotta be there, I ain't get to see my daddy around
We ain't never get to ball out kid
I was young, the game caught him before I did, but
Back to you son, as for you son
I'd do any and everything, that's the truth son
From the dirtiest diaper, till you get old enough to dirty your nikes up
I'm your clean up man
You ever need a hand, need a foot, need a heart, need a lung
Reach for the phone, call me up son
Yes, everything drops for you, everything stops for you
I'll bury a block for you
I'll let go every shot for you, and I'll reload the clip, just to make sho he's hit

[Chorus]
I gotta little boy to look after
I gotta little boy to look after
Said I gotta little boy to look after
And if I die then my child'll be a bastard
And if I die then my child'll be a bastard

Everyday I look in your face, I sit back and I smile
Look at his face, its just like mine, wow
Damn, this kid shines
Authority and prioritys, this kids mine, so
That means I gotta beat him if I have to
Keep him out of bad schools, teach him how to rap smooth
Show him the ropes like, make sure his rope's tight
No screws loose, no loose screws
Got manners, got morals, got sense of respect
Cause when you gone, boy that's all you got left
You ever get craze for candy, don't take a strangers candy
Open a strangers candy, those are the strangest candys
I'm your rider, your guider, pusher, provider
But most of all I'm your father and I'm just looking out for you
When there's a problem, man I'm just looking out for you
I'm not talking man, I'm just pulling out for you
The ford, a sword, the hood'll come out for you
And what I'm about to do, you shouldn't go out and do
You just make sure your good to me, you good to mom
Respect your elders, you grow to be good and strong

[Chorus]
I raise you up in the sky, like behold
The only thing greater then I, YOU, my greatest achievement
Fuck a platinum plaque, this is history in the making, believe it
Without you I can't make or succeed shit
I can't think, I can't wake up and eat shit
You the reason, that I'm breathin'
And I will stop at any moment to see this, child live a better life
Wow its a better life, but you better throw down if you ever fight
Like Rocky do, don't be no punk when its time to get up and put on your boxing shoes
You lace em up tight, you fall, get up fight
You lose, oh well, we all lose some fights
Just be a man about yours, life is all about handling yours
So you just keep handling yours

[Chorus]
