[Juelz Santana:]
I'm just a rocka dude
Lookin for my rocka girl
Baby I'll rock your boat
Rock your bed, and rock your world
But you gotta be as fly as me
You gotta know how to rock your stuff
VH1 Brett Michael, Be my rock of love
VS 1, big stones
Lemme rock ya
Maybe marriage, baby carriage
Lemme knock ya up
I could be your rocka daddy
You could be my rocka mommy
I could your chilly pepper
You could be my hot tamale
Have your ever made love to a rockstar?
In a hot car with the top off
In the middle of a parkin lot
You don't care who see, who look, or who watch ya
Pretty face
And the body soft as baby skin
She hopped on me and rode
I thought my name was Harley Davidson

[Girl:]
You got your tattoos
I got my tattoos too
We stay up all night and do what rockstars do
We got the music
Bumpin thru the system
The room is real smoky
Highlights in a mansion
We lovin all night
We sleepin all day
Wake up and hit the mall
Stay fresh and rock our way
They try to imitate us
They could never duplicate us
Pull up in the Ferrari
Saying hello to all my haters

[Hook: x2]
Have you ever made love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. made. love

[Girl:]
You drive a fast car
I drive a fast car too
Suicide doors with the topless roof
Now we're cruisin
Glasses on the face
Cus he ducking paparazzi, they high speed chasin
We got a maserati but we drivin in a range
Cus we don't give a damn
Switch rides by the day, day, day
Now this is what I call rockstar love
This was the question I was thinkin of

[Hook: x2]
Have you ever made love
To a rockstar
In a hot car
With his guitar, playing on the side
Have. you. ever. mad. love

[Lil Wayne:]
I'm a r-o-c-k star
And I can play with that pussy like I play my guitar
Call me Weezy F the best you ever saw
She the best you never saw goo you ain't even lookin
Got a chauffeur but he ain't even lookin
We in the back seat poppin like fried chicken cookin
And I'm tied to that pussy like flies on my duce
Shawty got class
And no I won't play hooky
But no not never
Put my feet on the pedal
And make that guitar go madder like
Told ya girl
I could play with that pussy like I play my guitar
