[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Ayo lately i've been going through some family matters
My mother keep telling me "family matters"
I got this attitude like, damn these matters
I'm grown now, I know how to handle matters
Chrome four four handle magnums
In case he run and now I don't get a chance to grab'em dog
I'll catch you while you parallel parkin'
Gun in each hand start parallel sparkin'
Kill you and your man put y'all in parallel coffins
Yeah these big guns we riding with
And my clips stay wide and shit
The bullets stay the size of Twix
You don't wanna get popped with this
Homeboy so watch your lips
Y'all talk real tough but I know y'all very weak
You fucking with a ghetto beast that never sleeps
I don't need a hundred niggas to settle beef
Just my arm and hand stretched out with that metal piece
Ye all laughing and think it's a game
'Til I pop you and you leaking in pain
Oh you in a casket and ya baby mom thinks it's a shame

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Now I'ma have my mommy mad again
When she found out that I'm back to playing with these keys like Tommy Flanagan
And my girl said if I have to tell my man again
If you end up in that can again I'm through with your shenanigans
But I'm back on the corner and I'm panicking
With a big gun that'll have you stiffer than a mannequin
Shit is brain damaging
All this cocaine handling
You can catch me on the corner crazy crispy with the chain dangling
And in the same way I'm running the clubs
Oh yeah dogs I'm one of those thugs
That's allowed and drunk pissy and blooded on drugs
Shit a hundred of bloods my gun and my slugs
The way I be feeling y'all niggas want it then WHAAAT?
I had you pay the ultimate price
Like dealing with my vultures ain't nice
They coming for them long chains and pieces that sculpt you with ice
Just the same shit that scuffed my life
Ah fuck it man this culture ain't right
Some say I hopped out the jag and the rag fell
But I say when I hopped out the jag did you know that the top of the rag fell

[Verse 3: Cam'ron]
Ayo everybody out at the Up in smoke tour
I was uptown gats out up in coke wars
Bootleg gunshop up in both stores
Both grip, both hands held both 4's
Ups downs highs lows see both doors
Die or to live decisions are both yours
But two cats fronted I broke both jaws
I'm with 2 chicks you know I fucked both whores
Homicide, robbery I broke both laws
I do you like food I assume you roast yours
I been so poor couldn't afford a condom had to go raw
Next day in the free clinic, oh lord!
When you became a willy
Is you insane or silly
I will aim the milli dog yeah at your brain for rilly
It's not a game my nilly
I'ma do this 'til every last damn chain is chilly
How many came to kill me
I hustle with greed my voice is real bitter
She fuck up my money ain't no choice but to hit her
Bust your [?] leather 'til the boys come to get her
That's the difference in our money six sixes to a figure
Hookers and hoodrats using sex as a gimmick
I got a tournament for handicaps, special olympics
Next to the clinic in case one of they leg gets dismembered
Last year Richard tip broke a hip he was injured
Won a hundred go to Nerway, per se
Feds want niggas up in the birdcage for shit back in the third grade
Lord you see I made it back
Love to send a slave a track
NYPD told you trace raise the rat took and gave it back
Betray the fact they bugged the jeep seats, floors and lightbulbs
So I had to change the Range up and game up with these white thugs
Now on it two, see the station
Meet Jimmy Iovine, give me my cream
Shapiro, Peter Gatien, relation
Spot a club in L.A just to touch it up
Got rugged up thug it up but named the club suck and fuck Whatever nigga what is what respect power the sets our
Two guns we on news one, next hour lead shower
With weapons involved our kappa revolved
Now we deluxe apartment George Jefferson bar
I'm from where Nicky Barnes, Mr. Fricks got rich as fuck
Rich and A hit the kitchens that was pitchin' up
Rob Base, Mase, Dougie Fresh switched it up
I do both who am I to fuck tradition up
