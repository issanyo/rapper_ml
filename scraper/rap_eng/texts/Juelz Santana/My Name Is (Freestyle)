Hey, so I'm back, dough I got that, and I rock that bandanna
Hi, my name is what? my name is who? my name is Santana
Hey, so I'm back, dough I got that, and I rock that bandanna
Hi, my name is what? my name is who? my name is Santana

Hi guys
Do You like my life?
Tell me, do you like guns, pussy, drugs, the life?
Are there any one of those three things you do not like?
Number two? pussy?
Are you gay? do you like guys?
Are you one of these dudes that sleeps with a night light?
Bright, bright
So the bed bugs don't come and bite, bite
Thought you was gangsta?
Oh that was just an image drawn on paper, no I'm gonna erase ya
Stay back you rap dudes
The game is hungry
Now bring the steak back
You make the fast food
My brains mixed up
That's why I spit stuff
To make a chick in a strip club
Give me a tit cup
After I tip hup
You wanna engrave it and get dub
Then guess what?
You'll be the one digging it, idiot
You getting it? you digging it? you bleed
Just like a chicks period, I'm serious
And I've been watching you rappers acting, acting rapping
You're still in my ways, you're swagger jacking
And I'm not surprised, but I'm here to tell you
I already got a son, stop it guys
Don't bother nigga
I'm a father nigga
Go look for someone else to be a father figure
I do this niggers, and I do this well
But I'mma stop now, and leave it up for you to tell
