Thick lips, hips, tits, a** like no other
I get big chips, cash like a no other

Bring the boat out, smoke out
Watch the water move

Surfing the (wave), I'm hurting the (wave)

Could it be I'm from the eighties
They know what I'm up against
Call me a grinder, call me a survivor
Why should I (wait), how could I (wait), no
Plus I'm a sex symbol (symbol)
That'll make your b**** bed tremble
Floor shake, bar rock, hard cock (cock)
Hit it left once, right twice, work the middle
Stoke her, then I smoke her

(Chorus - repeat to fade)
