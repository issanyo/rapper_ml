[Intro: Cam'ron]
Hey Ma remix
Diplomats Records.. let's go

[Chorus: Toya (Cam'ron)]
I like it, you like it (hey ma, what up, let's slide)
I love it, you love it (you drink, I smoke, alright
We all here in the building, Jim Jones, Killa)
You want it, I got it (got trucks, got jeeps, let's ride, let's ride)
(Freekey, Santana)
There's no need for you to be afraid  (hey ma, hey ma)
(Holla at me, ma)

[Verse 1: Cam'ron]
Yo, where my baby at? Not home
I heard her drop's chrome
V-12, uh-oh my little girl done got grown
Stocks grown, whereabouts are not known
But she check on the kid, hit the block phone
See you beat your girl
You need to free your girl
Let her breathe, B, go see the world
Wanna lock her down like she on punishment
That's why every time I hit it dog, I punish it

[Verse 2: Toya]
Let me tell ya why I seen you many times
Can't describe the way you make me feel
Hang over his or mine, you got me feelin high
Could chemistry be the real?
Boy it's so true that I'm wanting you
Can we hook up and spend some time?
You're the first one, boy the only one
That's always on my mind

[Bridge: Toya]
In a summer day, in the winter time
When you breathe the heat, gotta make you mine
And I'm liking all the things you do
Can I get the chance to know you, so come on

[Chorus: Toya (Cam'ron)]
I like it, you like it (hey ma, what up, let's slide)
No need to front when I'm around
I love it, you love it (you drink, I smoke, alright, alright)
That's why you keep on staring me down
You want it, I got it (got trucks, got jeeps, let's ride, let's ride)
And I'm telling you that
There's no need for you to be afraid  (hey ma, hey ma)
I like it

[Verse 3: Toya (Cam'ron)]
So you walking by, again you caught my eye
I knew right then you were the one I needed in my life
So check a lid and find, I nearly lost my mind
When you graced me with your presence for the second time
Let's get together and do whatever
There's no need for you to waste your time
I wanna make moves, if it's alright with you
Hit me up so we can chill sometime (this is remix)

[Bridge: Toya (Cam'ron)]
In a summer day, in the winter time
When you breathe the heat, gotta make you mine
And I'm liking all the things you do
Can I get the chance to know you, so come on (remix)

[Chorus: Toya (Cam'ron)]
I like it, you like it (hey ma, what up, let's slide)
No need to front when I'm around
I love it, you love it (you drink, I smoke, alright, alright)
That's why you keep on staring me down
You want it, I got it (got trucks, got jeeps, let's ride, let's ride)
And I'm telling you that
There's no need for you to be afraid (hey ma, hey ma)
I like it

[Verse 4: Cam'ron]
Killa, uh, uh
Hey ma, what's up?
Yes, you rather hot
That car I copped? I just had to drop
It for you though, paint the thing apricot
When you take off, you'll feel like an astronaut
When I get pulled, momma say pass the Glock
Stash the rocks, F cops, smash the drop
Watched her go from Benetton to Dolce
Via speaker Louie, now her gold is rosy

[Verse 5: Juelz Santana, (Toya) & Cam'ron]
Hey ma, what's up?
Let's slide - I got the ride parked right outside
And once again we must discuss something
Calm down, don't touch nothing
Remember I still ain't crush nothing
I ain't trying to be rude
I'm liking your groove, liking your move
The red stripe on your shoes
Those are Prada, right? Damn, I'm her type
She trying to get to know me
I'm trying to pop tonight cause
(I like it, you like it)
So let's do it, let's move it baby
Once again we up the west side
Only difference is she leaning on my left side
Playing with this, damn!
I call Cam, know he waiting for this shit
Phone rings, know he waiting for this
Yo Cam, what up?
I stuffed, say word
That's right, that's right
And y'all got it on toniiiight

[Bridge 2: Toya]
I like the way you move the things (say word) you do to me
Your smile (my smile) got me feelin you (feeling me, huh?!)
(This is remix) your attitude
Your style goes out on 23 (on them Jordans)
I know you're feelin me (yeah, I'm feeling you)
I like it, you want it, so get up on it! (This is remix)

[Chorus: Toya (Cam'ron)]
I like it, you like it (Dipset, Killa Cam, Santana)
No need to front when I'm around (Jim Jones, Freekey, uh)
I love it, you love it (Toya, holla at ya boys)
That's why you keep on staring me down
You want it, I got it
And I'm telling you that
There's no need for you to be afraid
I like it (this is remix)

I like it, you like it
No need to front when I'm around
I love it, you love it
That's why you keep on staring me down
You want it, I got it
And I'm telling you that
There's no need for you to be afraid
I like it (this is remix)

I like it, you like it
No need to front when I'm around
I love it, you love it
That's why you keep on staring me down
You want it, I got it
And I'm telling you that
There's no need for you to be afraid
I like it (this is remix)
