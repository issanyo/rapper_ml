What is this? What is this, man?!
This sounds like some graveyard shit (Uh-Oh)
Well that's what the fuck they gonna need
Cuz I'mma bury these niggas this time around (Chea)

(Verse 1)
Who better than me? You better than me?
Shit you never will see, If you dead and deceased
Keep tools, lead, and the piece
And I'm bustin it off right
Leave a trail of smoke like a FUCKIN exhaust pipe
Took the coke up out the stash, cause they know about the stash
Now I'm like swallow these dope up in the bags
Coke up in the bags, Yea sown up in the bags
I do my chicks like Ludacris, "Blow it Out Your Ass!"
I'm a mean pimp, You know what I mean, pimp?
Four hoes on each strip, All bringing me chips
Futuristic
So when I'm gone they gonna have to do ballistics
Just to prove I'm this sick
You niggas need to be spanked by your mommy
For ever thinking you'll be greater than I'll be
You get that short, late, waist-pack money
I get that all straight ASAP money
Bring it here now!

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Touch the coke, touch the pot
Add the soda, what you got? Me! (Yea!)
I am what I am, I be what I be
And that you will see, I am crack

[Verse 2]
Who want with I? You want it with I?
I'll shoot one in your eye, You'll lose one of your eyes
I'll jam, move, and slump ya
Leave ya body in Ranch Cucamunga with ants moving under
My flow so in order
I could turn soap and water to ocean water and float the border
You never will be what I forever will be
Your tombstone never will read "We buried a G" (No!)
I'm so mean and nice, with the things I write
Jesus might say "Jesus Christ!"
It's only rap, so why y'all tryna hold me back
Like y'all ain't ask for the old me back (I'm here!)
My peoples play and slang cocaine
More than Billy Blanco from +Carlito's Way+
So you can find me on the streets, okay?
With the big fucking piece, okay?! ('K'?!)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Too dope for this, but you won't admit
So my tool smoke and spit, make you choke on spit
You ever seen a man gagged and goggle
Sound like a newborn tryna ask for bottle
They like cut it out you slackin, But I bust it out in rappin
Can you name a nigga better without me bustin out and laughin?
Nigga you couldn't spit enough to get at me
I'll stretch you for extracirricular activities
Forget hollerin for help
I'll make you wanna pull your lip over your head and just swallow yourself
You're not on my level, you're not on my shelf
But you can and you will be just another notch on my belt
I'm more 'mazing than Grace is when I say shit
You should say 'Amen' after my name, kid
Yes, this is that of greatness
You should say 'Amen' after this statement

[Hook]
