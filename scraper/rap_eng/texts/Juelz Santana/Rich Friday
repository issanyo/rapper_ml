Walking downtown with a fat booty freak
You get a ring, so they don't visit your door
20 G's on me
Designer from my head to the floor
These niggas ain't seeing me
These niggas think they wanna be me, but they know that they can't
I got worldwide streets status
Affiliated with the gangstas and killers
Yeah, now my niggas, I ride for my niggas
And I'm down for my niggas
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Whipping salt harder than tank door
Smoking killer, I am with a killer
Pull up to the dealer looking like a dealer
