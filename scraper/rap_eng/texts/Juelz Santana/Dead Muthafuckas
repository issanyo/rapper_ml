We told niggas about eight years ago
We had this shit in the smash right (Aight)
This shit too light man
(In the building)
I got us, Dipset
Lets go
Freekey
(I'm sorry I'm late, lets get it rockin')

[Verse 1]
Everybody out at the "Rock The Mic" tour (Word?)
I'm back in the kitchen rocking the white raw (Right!)
Coping your pie for
Locking your nice doors
I pop up in like four wit chicken that like gores
They click if they like war
Fixing to fight for, me
Look at my ice for sure your sight sore (Whoa)
We all wearing links
As I prepare a drink
Glare and think how I got the whole new york wearing pink
Girls they stare and wink, how I flare the mink
Drop the top
Pop a throttle
Hock a Glock
Pop a bottle (bottle)
Seen "Paid In Full", now I'm up in "Blockbuster"(Busta!)
And I'm paid in full, still on the block busta
'94 rock "Rucker", '01 rob "Rucker"
Shoguns show guns, Blow one, you're not gutta
Little inside joke for you cocksuckas (sucka)
My Block, sucka, pop corn and hot butta
Like its the movie theater
But its the oozie area
Hoody Hoo, call hoody hoo produce hysteria (Hoody Hoo!!!)
And me I ain't no coattail bitch
I get the Motel 6, where them hoes sell bricks

Killa

Dipset!

[Chorus]
[Cam'Ron and (Juelz Santana)]

Jump! Back!
Glock! Cock!
Aim! Shoot!
(Y'all some dead motherfuckers)

[Repeat Twice]

[Verse 2]
I bitch straight up, get in the car (Oh Shit!)
I'm the shit in the car
I do like Alfre-do, shit in your car
Pop-a-squat in the drop
Take a drop in the drop
While you dropping the top, unlocking your locks
Damn!
Last year y'all got a mask in your ride
Y'all imagine its hard, y'all asking for jobs (Jobs?)
Realize I'm attached to the mob
Selling crack in the park, building sacks in the Saab
And chrome, give you skin burns
Leave your dome like ringworms (Worms)
And niggas coming home, they my interns
We the cake couple, put together great puzzles
Hood they love us, the hood together we stay subtle
Juggle bubble, why you niggas hate tussles? (Y'all don't wanna fight)
I didn't always hustle, I was Ma$e muscle
He had the ones so he bought the body
I had the guns so I caught the body
Done son off in the lobby (Finished)
I stay wit the gun shooters, drum movers
Raazoo Kahlua turn one ruler to son doola
And the same brother that you knew
Came through in the rain same color as +Yoohoo+ (Y'all don't know)
Now you know thats the same color as doo doo (Shit)
I'm the shit, call me Pepe Le Poo-Poo
And I got eses thats cuckoo
You freshe like they LuLu
From freshe they don't doo you

Killa....Killa

Dipset!

[Chorus]
Killa!
