Kane is in the building, nigga
Hahaha

[Intro: YelaWolf]
I'm on the pavement, thinking about the government
Santana's in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
Mixin' up the medicine
Mixin' up the medicine
I was in the basement, mixin' up the medicine

[Juelz Santana]
I'm baaaack

[Hook: YelaWolf]
Mixin' up the medicine
Mixin' up the medicine
I was in the basement, mixin' up the medicine
I get jail, jump bail
Get jail, jump bail
Get jail, jump bail
Join the Army if you fail
(x2)

[Verse 1: YelaWolf]
Catfish... Yeah
Mixin' up the medicine
Tripping on the mescaline
Moonshine in the bottle
Got the rooms running like peppermints
Spinning like a ceiling fan
Hotter than I've ever been
If you wanna chop it up
You need a propeller, man
Cellophane, sell a gram
Don't sell me the weather, man
If you wanna make it rain
'Make It Rain' a better jam
Y'all weaker than baby's hands
Faker than a rent-a-van
Take it back, make a track
Then give a pen to Yela, man
An' I'll stomp on that beat
Like its a fight that I'm just jumping in
The south is getting crunk again
In-and-out like I'm punching in
Bitch better go take lunch again
I'm working with a bomb of confidence
Politicking  and flipping the system
Using my wrist and mixin'...

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Lights, camera, action
I'm feeling fantastic
Flyer then a pair of wings flapping
Take my picture
You a freak, I'mma freak
You goin' home? Take me wit'cha
I'll look at your baby pictures
But I won't have no baby wit'cha
Back up boy ya heard me
Back up boy ya heard me
I'm ballin' like the '80s
Yeah I'm so James Worthy
Still making money off the white girl - Fergie
I ain't a new boy so they know they can't jerk me
No limit how I get it, call me Percy
Miller, I'mma killer, no mercy
And I'm so dope you'd think Frank Lucas served me
So hot fire couldn't burn me
Bitches wanna nurse me
Take her out and trick around
I take her home and dick her down
And send her back to you
Like "Baby, I was at my sisters house"
Y'all niggas remember me
I'm every rapper's enemy
Cause they know once I get the lead
They'll never get ahead of me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Swag on rooftops
Air Ones, new Glock
You wanna get loud, you get blasted - Boombox
Attitude like 2Pac, when Juice dropped
Still go to the dealer, with the money in a shoebox (Gimme Dat)
This wasn't 'posed to come out
This wasn't 'posed to come out
They let that new drug out
They let that new drug out
My niggas 'bout to dumb out
My ladies 'bout to bug out
And if her body crazy, I'mma take her to the nuthouse (Pow)
You lames ain't interesting
The games been missing this
You niggas full of sugar and I came with the insulin
Whatever's your addiction
I got the prescription
I get it how I'm living and I'm loving every minute
You got that shit that just came out, that new-new
I got that shit that ain't come out, its too-new
I'm so intriguing, your girl so deceiving
I'm so exciting and she's so conniving

[Hook]
