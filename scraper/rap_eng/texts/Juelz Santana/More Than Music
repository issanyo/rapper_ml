[Intro]
Yeah, okay
(we gon' do it like this)
I'm back again, Santana (OH!)
Fuck with your boy (Dipset)
Dipset, Heatmakerz
(Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Yo, I try to be easy
I try to be calm, breathe easy, it don't seem easy (nope)
I'm on my P's and Q's (what else?)
Y's and Z's, 4-5's on the side of me
Plus, four guys on the side of me (with what?)
With 4-5's on the side of them (yeah)
We can play now, this is a war, not a playground
We came to lay or get laid down, spray or get sprayed down
Waterfalls any day now, cops with their wall to wall raid downs
I'm ducking and weaving, running and leaving
Not trying to feel the cuffs when they squeezing
Or the plugger they stuck to Lumina
So I'm stuck with this Nina, I'm stuck with this finger
Itchy as fuck, you fucked up I'll leave ya, chump
Went to school, but ain't stay in class, hated class
Only first period, yep, I could relate to math
Played games, but the games is bad
You know, cops and robbers, laser tag, see what I was aiming at
Hop scotching on niggas faces left my ankles bad
That ain't stop me from working I got me a worker
Gotta him to work, and yeah, chopping the work up
Keep him on the clock, clocking my work up, niggas know me
Taught him how to cook, liven his work up
Told him it's not the pot, it's the worker, gotta mix shorty
Gotta do it like this, shorty (this shorty)
Clockwise, counter-clockwise, it's all in the wrist, shorty
Fuck with me (shorty)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Chorus]
This is a movement, this is a union
This is more than what you people call music
I'm part of this Dipset confusion
TECs up, we moving, catch up, y'all losing
Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope
This is powerful music that I bring to the table
Seat for the able, fuck with your boy, OH!

[Verse 2]
You motherfuckers really don't know (nope)
You motherfuckers really won't know (nope)
I'm real, fucka, I really won't fold (come on)
I kill fuckas and wheelie off roads (yeah)
Bangie rapper, like I'm really off road (let's go)
The pain I feel, I really won't show man
The game is real, I really don't know, Cam
If I'ma make it or not
But my plan was to take it straight to the top
Bring my fame to the block, with me
Harlem's my home, so I'm making it hot with me
Til the day I'm layed on the block, with shots in me
Stay weeded, stay cheifing a blunt
Stay losing some more pounds, I ain't eating enough, nope
Stop fronting holmes, you won't do nothing holmes
Killa locked this, I'm what's up and coming holmes
You better believe
One thing I was always taught in my household: better achieve
No matter what you do, you better succeed
That was embedded in me, yeah, the rest was left up to me
So I, played my position, I stayed in the kitchen
Base tripping on the bottom of the plate when I'm mixing
Cake whipping on the bottom of the plate when I left it
Eight digits when I take it, break it and flip it
This is the Matrix, I take it we live in
Shit, I'm seeing the sun, I'm Neo the one, believe me
Hand picked like cotton, I've been sent here not to be forgotten
My hands grip the dots in, I gets it poppin
Shoot shit, shit is poppin
Move bricks get it rocking, y'all know me
Ya young homie from the block, y'all forgot me already?
Holla back, the young Rocky is ready, whoa!
Yeah, come on, okay, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh...

[Chorus]
This is a movement, this is a union
This is more then what you people call music
I'm part of this Dipset confusion
TECs up, we moving, catch up, y'all losing
Y'all ain't big enough to be at the table, nope
Y'all ain't big enough to eat at the table, nope
This is powerful music that I bring to the table
Seat for the able, fuck with your boy
