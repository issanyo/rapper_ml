She weighs 4 hundred (oh shit)
4 hundred and 3
Oh she's a fat bitch
A fat bitch indeed
And she loves to eat

[Chrous:]
Now I ain't saying she a fat bitch
But she weighin' more than average
And she ain't turnin' down no sandwich
And she damn sure ain't sharin'
Go head girl go head eat on
Go head girl go head eat on
Go head girl go head eat on
Go head girl go head eat on

Now I notice this girl walkin' in the grocery store
Lookin' like she weighs about 4 hundred or more
I'm like, damn
She a fat bitch (fat bitch)
She weighin' more than average
Go head girl go head eat on
Go head girl go head eat on
Go head girl go head eat on
Go head girl go head eat on

Now I notice this girl walkin' in the grocery store
Lookin' like weighs about 4 hundred or more
I'm like, damnnn
She a fat bitch (fat bitch)
She weighin' more than average (average)
Now I wasn't tryna watch her heavy
I wasn't tryna watch steadly
But I couldn't understand why the bitch had her hand fulla junk and a diet pepsi
What kinda diet you on?
You ain't on a diet, you know you lyin' you wrong
You gotta get up, get out and do somethin'
You ain't gotta lose it all, but lose somethin'
Now I ain't the one for talkin' dissin'
But baby girl you lookin like a walkin' kitchen
But don't worry, I come here late
I fuck fat bitches I don't discriminate
At least I know that ma dinner straigt, I know I'm gonna get fed, I know it's a dinner plate
I just I can't let her get all hot
When it get on top, that's when the shit all stops
Get out girl go head stay out
Don't come back girl I said stay out
I told you don't get on top of me man your too big for that shit baby
What you tryna kill me man

[Chorus:]
Now I ain't saying she a fat bitch
But she weighin' more than average
And she ain't turnin' down no sandwich
And she damn sure ain't sharin'
Go head girl go head eat on
Go head girl go head eat on
Go head girl go head eat on
Go head girl go head eat on

Eyy, I mean I heard fat bitches know how ta dance
Plus I already know how to drop it like it's hot
Drop it like it's hottt
I'm just playin' to each his own, to own his each
This is your boy juelz santana, dipset
Fat bitches you already know I love you like I love myself, ya
