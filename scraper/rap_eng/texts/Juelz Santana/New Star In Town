We got a new star in town
Talk to 'em baby
(lalalalala)
Santana
Dipset (ha)
Skull gang
Ya' digg?

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
Let me open up your legs like suicide doors
The goose got me loose, patron got you gon'
I can keep a secret, so you can take me home
I can make you moan, you can make me grown
Sex like you do that, we can make a song
Smoke, drink, party, I'm coming down ya' lane
Slam dunk

1, 2, 3 and to the 4
I don't shine, I glow
My dough like wow
Tonight's the night I get in some shhhh, no?
Tonight's the night I get in ya'
And I don't kiss and tell
I sniff and smell
And if it smells good, I'll lick ya', well
And I can get you wetter than a wishing wale
Get it like a hammer when I hit a nail
I keep it on a hush honey
You could be my hush puffy
I could be your playboy
You could be my hush bunny
Shhhh
Come play and get a taste in me
And basicly your secret is save with me
Ya'digg?
