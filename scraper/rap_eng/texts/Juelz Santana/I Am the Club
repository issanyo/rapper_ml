[Chorus: Skull Gang]
I am the club, now put your bottles up
I am the club, you know what's up
I am the club, why you hate on us
I am the club, you know what up

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
It's party time, and I'm the life of the party
I step in the spot, you know how I come through
Like, it's my party, and I do what I want to
Make a move if you want to
Shake it, baby, while I hump you
I don't know how to dance, but I'll give you my 1 2
Give you some funky fresh, if you give me enough room
I break it down, I break it down
You see the swag, drippin, they know who to come around
See them bottles poppin, they know it's money around
Man, calm down, you know the gun is around

[Chorus: Skull Gang]
I am the club, now put your bottles up
I am the club, you know what's up
I am the club, why you hate on us
I am the club, you know what up

[Verse 2: Skull Gang]
Woke up in the party, it feel like I'm at home
At least 20 numbers I'm trna have in my phone
If 10 of them is bad, I have m sippin Patrone
And the other half, shake m, and I'll be gone
Headed to the place, we about to get it on
I know what you niggas sound like, but you wrong
Tell the DJ keep playing it, then play another song

[Chorus: Skull Gang]
I am the club, now put your bottles up
I am the club, you know what's up
I am the club, why you hate on us
I am the club, you know what up
