*Opera Singing*
Dip Set let's get it on (x6)

(Verse)
This is marching music, this is monster music
Everybody get the fuck up, get to stomping to it
Get the band, get the drumline, we marching to it
Get your aunt, get your uncles, get your mom's into it
This is lovely noise, this is club knocking
This is razors out chump, this is club ox'ing
This is grab a bitch, get the club rockin'
Hit the bar, big spender, get the bub' poppin'
This is move, get the fuck out the way
Or get moved the fuck out the way, chump
Niggas get tools the fuck in the club
Niggas get moved the fuck in the club, don't play punk
Niggas get schooled outside of the class from tryin' be fast
Shots hot and pop in your ass nigga
Bitches cut school to get with the boy
Your wife'll cut you to get with the boy, it's Big Pimpin' here
Big lobster, big shrimp in here, big mobsters, big fish in here
Yeah, get your fishing gear, they'll flip ya yeah
They'll twista ya yeah, they'll let you know the Dips is here
Get it clear

(Chorus)
This is monster music, this is contra music
This is arms out, bombs out, bombin' music
This is launchin' music, this embalmin' fluid
Everybody get the fuck up get to stompin' to it

This is monster music, this is contra music
This is niggas, this is bitches, this is all our music
This is marchin' music, this embalmin' fluid
Everybody get the fuck up, get to stompin' to it

(Verse)
My Kappas, my Sigmas, my clappers, my niggas
My Alphas, my Beta's, cowards and haters
Come style with the players, crack a thousand gators
Big gun, get wild and I'll spray ya
Big gun, sit down for I spray ya, or quick run
I'll shower you later, I don't mind nigga
I ain't got nothin' but time nigga
Plus you ain't hard to find niggas, three blocks from my niggas
Where they squeeze Glocks, divide niggas
And that green top suplies niggas, lean drop beside niggas
Easdrop and watch niggas, we cop and ride niggas
Coke hard, go hard we block niggas
Young Joe Clark lean on me, shots go off
Should've told you not to lean on me
Your bitch won't fuck you I told her not to cheat on me
I think you're a clown she totally agrees with me
She comes over and she sleeps with me
USe the bathroom and pees with me, and goes home and eats with you (Damn)
You a chump nigga, you a punk nigga, get a grib, get your weight up nigga

(Chorus)
This is monster music, this is contra music
This is arms out, bombs out, bombin' music
This is launchin' music, this embalmin' fluid
Everybody get the fuck up get to stompin' to it

This is monster music, this is contra music
This is niggas, this is bitches, this is all our music
This is marchin' music, this embalmin' fluid
Everybody get the fuck up, get to stompin' to it
