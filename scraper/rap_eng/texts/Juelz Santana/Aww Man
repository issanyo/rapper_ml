Hood fame got my swag so hot yea I'm the man (aww man) (gat gat gat)
Cush man got me feelin' like a pilot flyin' in a plane (aww man) (gat gat gat)

Ice chain around my neck like a hooded mane
And when I fall up in the club check
I be lookin' for something thick and red
But (she she she) gotta have head on deck
And a (pop a big pill) if she ain't scared
(Pop a pop a pop a bottle) if she got bread
Sell me a whole thang if you ain't the fed
Cush pack (pack) got 'em helicopter high (high)
He ain't comin' down (why) he like it in the sky (whew)
White shit fish scale got 'em cross eyed
And if you wanna try then you gotta buy (gat gat gat)

Cocaine it'll make a nigga do strange thangs (aww man) (gat gat gat)
Money man it'll make a bitch do strange thangs (aww man) (gat gat gat)
Hood fame got my swag so hot yea I'm the man (aww man) (gat gat gat)
Cush man got me feelin' like a pilot flyin' in a plane (aww man)

[Santana]
I be in the club studs shinin'
My red stones call 'em blood diamonds
Poppin' bottles blowin' weed in here
Throwin' dough in the air like a pizzeria (yea)
Come get a slice I be pumpin bottles
It's like a Popa Johns in the trunk of my ride
Im a real nigga you don't wanna collide
Fuck if he bigger that choppa will cut 'em aside
What it do…bitch give me the loot
I treat that money like honey Im Winnie the Pooh
Now get on the strip and do your best walk
Make sure yo pussy ain't smellin' like a wet dog
Hood nigga smoke perk by the pound
Shot to I knock 'em down…know Im outta rounds
Im so high I be surfin' on the clouds
Got my weed got my lean shit I surfin' on 'em now

Cocaine it'll make a nigga do strange thangs (aww man) (gat gat gat)
Money man it'll make a bitch do strange thangs (aww man) (gat gat gat)
Hood fame got my swag so hot yea I'm the man (aww man) (gat gat gat)
Cush man got me feelin' like a pilot flyin' in a plane (aww man)
