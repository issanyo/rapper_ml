[Cam'Ron]
Uh, Coke I get it and gram it
Respect the kids that demand it
Girls be lickin and stickin
Showin me tits like they Janet
Drivin a stick is a standard
When you sit in the porsche
Of Course the wrist is on force
I put the Cris' in of course
(Lets go)
Jump Jump Jump jump, get your rocks and roll
Pumpin on the pump, hit the pump da da doe
Dats the cop call, chow bow down now (squally)
Go in girls ass (ah ah ah)
Be in Houston with Flip
In Memphis with 6
Atlanta T.I
We handle D.I
God damn I be fly
Hi so Cameron D I
Bye from hammers to pies
My tan is a 9
Shit, my man I'mma grind
Mixed gram or a dime
The phantom of phantoms
My phantom is lime
Outlandish I shine
They ain't understandin my rhymes
How I shoot cannons and 9s
Then always vanish in time
