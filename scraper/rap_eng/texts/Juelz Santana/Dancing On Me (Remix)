[Juelz Santana:]
Grind on me (Go!), Whine on me (Go!)
Now Turn Around And Put Yo' Behind on me (Go!)
Now grind on me (Aye),now grind on me (Aye)
Now Lemme Take You home, you can ride on me (Aye)
She ladies love me, Girls they adore me
The Haters Hate me, but they can't avoid me
She Wanna get kinky, She all on me
I Wanna get Freaky, me so Horny (AYYE!)
So I Whispered in Her ear like "What is we gon' do?" (Huh?)
She Looked at her friend, I'm like, "She could come, too" (Let's go)
All Three of us should get one room
And do the things we like to do, ay! (Yurp)
