Move it around, and around, and around, and around like a clock chick
To the sound, of the sound, of the sound of the clock's tick

And spin around to the sound of how the clock work

The grind on paper chase
The block on day to day
Listen, I'm always ticking
Like the clock on Flava Flav

Give cock, and don't stop giving
So can you
Wink wop, and don't stop whipping
And just
Make that clockwork (tick), get that clockwork (tock)
Shake that clockwork (tick), flip that clockwork (tock), shorty
AY, do what you gotta do for that clockwork
Nine to five, side moves for that clockwork
If you a soldier, homie, get you a doja (?) homie
Move the homie, tell him get that clockwork (homie)
AY, teach him how to mix that pot work
Right to left, all day, he'll get that clockwork
Listen
Tick, tock, tick, tock (homie) AY
That's what I call clockwork for ya
Holla at me, I got work for ya

If you out there pimpin' homie, that's clockwork
