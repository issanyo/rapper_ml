[Intro: Fly-Ty]
Yeah, these niggas out here ain't right, y'all
They out here singin'
Fly-Ty, y'all know what it is
Fly-Ty, what up

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
30,000 on my wrist, fuck you saying?
Count the cash at the lot, no complaining
Pussy niggas pointing fingers at my arrangement
They out here singing in these streets like Usher Raymond
Usher Raymond, Usher Raymond
These niggas singing in these streets like Usher Raymond
Usher Raymond, Usher Raymond
These niggas singing in these streets like Usher Raymond

[Verse 1: Fly-Ty]
30,000, all twenties, blew that on one watch
100 bands, all hundreds, blew that on one drop
Five bricks, broke down, sold that on one block
Those Taj Mahals go for ten dollars, one color on one block
Play around with Fly money, a nigga must wanna die money
I'ma get rich or die trying, put that on Sha Money
Did fifteen, came home, ball hard like I never left
In the town house, on Lenox Road, made with it, and the chef
It's Fly-Ty, know the name, I get money, know the game
I trip poppy, one call, he bring mo' trucks
Queens nigga, ballin' hard, my gear, slow bucks
Balenciagas on my feet, Fly-Ty don't walk cheap

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
30,000 on my wrist, fuck you saying?
Count the cash at the lot, no complaining
Pussy niggas pointing fingers at my arrangement
They out here singing in these streets like Usher Raymond
Usher Raymond, Usher Raymond
These niggas singing in these streets like Usher Raymond
Usher Raymond, Usher Raymond
These niggas singing in these streets like Usher Raymond

[Verse 2: Cap-1]
A hundred bricks gone out of room service
Any bitch seen with me, she's 'bout to serve her purpose
Flat foot pimpin', I don't have feelings
Pulled up to the club, I don't have a ceiling
200 K large, 'bout to Instagram it
With my centerfold bitch, she 'bout as thick as Janet
These niggas singing songs, niggas Usher Raymond
How the fuck you pull that bitch? These niggas must be payin'
I don't pay that bitch shit, barely pay attention
Tryna whip that new Mercedes, that's my favorite engine
Shouts out to my real niggas, steak sauce sweet, A1
Only fuck with the bossest bitches, first deals when that yay come
Run around with them shooters, nigga, my young niggas, they'll shake something
And these niggas singing in paper work, you don't like me nigga, then say something, I'm gone

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
30,000 on my wrist, fuck you saying?
Count the cash at the lot, no complaining
Pussy niggas pointing fingers at my arrangement
They out here singing in these streets like Usher Raymond
Usher Raymond, Usher Raymond
These niggas singing in these streets like Usher Raymond
Usher Raymond, Usher Raymond
These niggas singing in these streets like Usher Raymond

[Verse 3: Lil Durk]
These niggas be singing, tell 'em hold up
That mac barrel look like doughnut
From Chiraq back to New York
One nigga get smoked like Newport
Head shot full of veg, that red dot
Red beams on his face like red hot
Got a couple young niggas with dreadlocks
Rob me, bullets flying through dreadlocks
Ask about me, I'm 'bout that life
Change niggas and I won't think twice
These niggas, they snitch, they mice
Gave my nigga Young Cory life
[?]
No new niggas, no tellin'
LV on my feet, they illin'
Big Rollie on, we chillin'
My youngins shoot like barren
I got that D spot jammin'
My youngins shoot like Kevin
I got that D spot jammin'
I got it by the weight, I'm never changin'
And I gotta stay low, I see Usher Raymond

[Hook: Juelz Santana]
30,000 on my wrist, fuck you saying?
Count the cash at the lot, no complaining
Pussy niggas pointing fingers at my arrangement
They out here singing in these streets like Usher Raymond
Usher Raymond, Usher Raymond
These niggas singing in these streets like Usher Raymond
Usher Raymond, Usher Raymond
These niggas singing in these streets like Usher Raymond
