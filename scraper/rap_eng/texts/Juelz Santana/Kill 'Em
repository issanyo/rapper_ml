[Hook]
(Kill 'em) You niggas ain't nothin'

(Kill 'em) You niggas don't want it (kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em)
My niggas they get it (Money)

We'll kill you to get it (Money)

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
It's like everything I'm doin' is gangsta
My whole movement is gangsta
I maneuver with gangstas
I put the T R U in the gangsta
I'm a nuisance to gangstas
I be shooting at gangstas (kill 'em)
If he blink wrong (kill 'em)
If he think wrong (kill 'em)
Show this motherfucka these ain't no paintballs (kill 'em)
Put his eight ball dead in the side pocket
Some lead from a hot rocket
Left in his side pocket (kill 'em)
Fuck a microwave, that will turn his head to a hot pocket
I'm beggin you ock stop it
Cause never do I stop it
Whenever do I pop it I
(Kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em, kill 'em)
I lay around all day with the pound all day
Dog, I don't play around all day (no)
I pop up with the Glock up like its Groundhogs Day
And then I let a round off mayne
Now how that sound off mayne
When that pound go bang
Your face chow lo mein (bye)
Ciao lil' man
I'm great, when you see me bow lil' mayne

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
When the Glock go bang
When the shot go bang
All you gon' hear is (kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em)
And I'm not no game
I pop those thangs
All you gon' hear is (kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em kill 'em)
For them nachos I'll kill ya
For my block yo I'll kill ya
Let this nigga know he's not no guerilla
And that's not no chinchilla
That's a chopped up guerilla
That they chopped up to get ya
And you bought it (kill 'em)
This is not a real nigga
He is not in my picture
I eat lobster for dinner
He got spam on his plate
He got ham on his plate
I don't eat pork, hand me some steak
Nigga hand me some cake
Before I hand you the eight
Like a motherfuckin hand that you shake (shake, bitch)
Give you five nigga
I'm a live nigga
Who, what, where, when, why nigga, I nigga (kill 'em)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Cam'Ron]
What's my name? (Killa)

What them bitches say? (Killa Killa Killa Killa)
Uh oh, there go a catfight, bitches they spar for dome
Get in the car they foam
Never seen cars with phones? (never)
Santana, I give any part to holmes
Eye, ear, heart or bone
Back out the orange cones (back up)
Even though I go right at the sergeant stoned
Right with my orange stones
We are at home
Get moving and took out
I'm using the hood route
Hustla please, man you was the look out
Man just look out, I'm a raging bull
With amazing songs, so I'm Paid in Full
But there's no movie pra, doggy this the uzi ride
That leave you cutie rootie tootie little booty pie
It's my duty doc, you try to sue me, stop
How you try to judge me, I get Judge Judy shot
Now sue me ock, I just lay and smile
I'll rape your child
They won't make the trial (Killa)
