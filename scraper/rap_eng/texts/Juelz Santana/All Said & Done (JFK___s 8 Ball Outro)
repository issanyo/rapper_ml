Part I: All Said & Done

[Intro]
All said & done
This is how it's supposed to go
Why you acting all emotional?
All said & done

[Verse 1]
You know I'm numero uno with the fly talk
[?] Star Wars, Luke Skywalk
I slide off, jump on the jetty and fly off
You should have a app on your phone, iLost
And I'm about to get the champion plaque, the champion back
Hoodie on, champion black
Every song that I'm on it's a sample or crack
Talent still exists, I am an example of that, facts
I've always been the same, I ain't changed yet
I skate across the track like Wayne Gret
Lil homie, your life is a train wreck
I be kicked back smoking on train wreck
The word around town is I'm very nice
And how I'm catching the vibe is like Jerry Rice
I love women, I mingle with every type
I lay the foundation and then bury pipe
I got soul on the song, young Barry White
I wore every Adidas and bought every Nike
Yeah, the heavyweight champ is here
I'll rhyme so all you see is hands in air
Shit rare light beaming off the chandelier
You can't compare, you lighter than [?]
Brodie I took the title and it can't be shared

[Hook]
All said & done (We won)
This is how it's supposed to go
Why you acting all emotional?
All said & done
You [?]
And never [?]
All said & done
Ride the wave [?]
You never been on a boat before, woah
All said & done
This is how it's supposed to go
Why you acting all emotional?
All said & done

[Verse 2]
Santana, y'all niggas know me
All said done, they all said I'm done
Bet I be the one when it's all said and done
Been that nigga, plus the best shit to come
Still living for today 'case tomorrow never come
Wonder if my prayers for better days ever come
Then we elected Trump, fuck
Turn on the news, all you hear is another one
[?] how they killing us
Straight out of Harlem, you know the birth place
Better than you niggas on my worst day
So fly you would think everyday is my birthday
Not to mention how I get it, I serve cake
[?] playing get scraped like [?] plate
Or the bottom of the pot when the work's made
[?]
Wait, did I do that?
Dropping heat unexpected like the LV Supreme collab
[?] say most of these emcees is trash
Look at all these weirdos, I'm just sitting back
Getting brain like [?]

[Hook]
All said & done
This is how it's supposed to go
Why you acting all emotional? (Get back, boy)
All said & done
You [?]
And never [?]
All said & done
Ride the wave [?]
You never been on a boat before, woah
All said & done
This is how it's supposed to go
Why you acting all emotional?
All said & done

[Outro]
You trying to celebrate
Good living nigga

Part II: JFK's 8 Ball Outro

[Intro]
(Statik Selektah)
Yeah, what
As we journey on
On and on and on and on
Yeah
Statik, JFK yeah
Yeah, let me talk to 'em

[Verse 3]
Running through life trying to find my true speed
And there's too many R.I.P. across my news feed
I try to succeed [?] above that stress
But it's always [?] screaming they they're so blessed
They try to bury you, never let you see the light
Do they even listen? Wonder why I even write
And at night I toss and turn
And every day I understand, value every lesson learned
I'm eyeing the finish line, I swear I'm gonna finish mine
In a minutes time, nothing comes to a timid mind
We live to die, gotta balance regret
Adjust to the change, yeah the biggest challenge yet
Traces of hate circulating the circus
Monkey suits with no purpose
So deep my thoughts can't surface
Under the hood [?] service
[?] with a [?] spitting verses
All the way up, but look what's beneath you
They'll set you up then beat you, take your drugs and tweet you
You a weak dude, do you smell what the Rock is cooking
Rattle snakes from Austin to Brooklyn
This game will leave you vacant, shaking
Plus I heard the rats got a taste for the bacon
[?] have your whole body aching
Living life on the edge surrounded by razor, Gillette Stadium
Word

[Outro]
Yeah, whether you're stripes or solid, keeps your eyes on the 8 ball. Where the losers rack and the winners break. This is album number 8
