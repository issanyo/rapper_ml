[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Four, five, six, I need the bank back (Bank back)
That money always runnin', gotta chase that (Chase that)
R.I.P. Triple X, gotta stay strapped (Yup)
Nigga test me, I’ma ace that (Ace that)
Stay drippy and your girl wanna taste that (Taste that)
Okay, now you could have her face back (Face back)
All beef's gettin' served, where the plates at? (Plates at)
Hit ’em with the lead and erase that ('Rase that)
Let a nigga draw, we don't trace that (Trace that)
When you gettin' to the money, yeah, they hate that (Hate that)
Got 'em super mad, where they capes at? (Capes at)
Like a wig, nigga front, we gon' lace that (Lace that)
I'm P. Diddy with the semi, nigga, take that (Take that)
Chain all Rocky, word to A$AP (A$AP)
Touch mine, all I know is payback (Payback)
Spin his ass like a wave cap (Wave cap)

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
Grey doesn't matter, summer or the winter (Uh-uh)
Convertible coupes like it’s summers in the winter (It’s hot)
Blowin' money fast like I got a money printer
Might book you for a show and start dumpin’ at your Sprinter (Boom)
Forgive me, Lord, because I've become a sinner
Talkin' beef, you better pray 'cause you become the dinner (Stupid)
You know my lady, she be steppin’ on rose petals (Facts)
And not the flowers, man, I'm talkin' 'bout rose pedals (Yeah)
They talkin' smoke, we be here when the smoke settle (We be here)
You got put up by the fan when the coke settle (We got dry)
I got lost on the yacht with like four levels (Where you at?)
And I still make it hot with the cold metal (Grr)
Who else you know still be drippy to the floor? (Get it)
Splashin' up a mess, fashion at its best (Ahh)
Gettin' fly, which of course I be passin' every test (Facts)
Young nigga from the block, I was passin' off the TEC (Uh-oh)

[Chorus: Juelz Santana]
Who them boys everybody wanna be? Dipset
Who them boys all them bitches wanna meet? Dipset
Who them boys really get it in the street?
We them boys, now everybody repeat it after me
Dipset, Dip
Dipset, Dipset, bitch
