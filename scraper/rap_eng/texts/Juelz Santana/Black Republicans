[Intro]
Now this is what they've been waiting for
Ya dig, Santana
Weezy F
Ay Wayne
What up man
What you been workin' on nigga?
Oh you know, I got Curren$y's new album
And prolly workin' on my album, ya dig
Oh I'm ready to brush my shoulders off and drop my next album too nigga
That's what it is
But dig this, they wanna know what we been workin' on together
That's that "I Can't Feel My Face Shit" they know that
So if they ever thought the South and the North was gonna collide
Guess what, we already did

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
I'm feelin' like a black Republican, naw, I can't call it
More like a black Democrat runnin' 'em out of office (Get out)
Young Barack-a Obama, I'm all for it
The Rock of Gibraltar has now fallen, on ya
I protect my land like a farmer
Pockets stay chubby like Toccara
Or should I say fat like the Parkers
Tote big guns like I'm still playin' Contra
Y'all washed up like money that's laundered
Y'all funny, I'm bonkers
Honest, girls strapped to my dick like a harness
Rock star, flier than an ostrich
And I cover east, west, north, south like a compass
I shall shine forever, never tarnish
Money buried behind my house like a garden
All green, my bank account's like a forest
I Can't Feel My Face is gettin' started
And Weezy is my accomplice, ya dig
A black activist like Sonny Carson
Stripes of a sergeant, salute me
And chicks, I get 'em high, higher than turbulence is
White Phantom, lookin' so Fergielicious
I'm from the city of big drugs and murder victims
Its get rich, go to jail or be a murder victim
Ay! Now all y'all listen
If you can't take the heat, get out the kitchen

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I feel like a black Republican, tote the MAC in the public and
Act so southern n' die for my brethren, money
Money, money, like money Mac and publishing
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan
Streets cold but the heat make me feel covenant
Been had cake, you late like Ed Sullivan
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them
And my mind is on another continent
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politic
But I get all in her mouth like Polident
New Orleans representer to the end. I
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep
Wake a nigga ass up like he got somewhere to be

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
I feel like a black Republican, drug money comin' in
I'm a volcano filled with lava about to erupt again
I stay with the iron, don’t make me plug it in
Stay outta rich kids' business, don’t be buttin' in
I stay with a chick that's ready to unbutton it
Forget a tongue, she put a lung on it
My Listerine come out, she start guzzlin'
I’m above you dudes, I’m hoverin'
Juelz, why you duckin' them?, Duckin' who?
I’m in the hood like, “What it do?", comfortable
And believe me, it's nothing to
Send my London boys to English muffin you
You poodles barkin' too much they bringin' muzzles through You ain't gully, you gullible
They need love, they need hugs
They need church, Jesus! Could it be 'cause
They them (Losers), and we us (Winners)
And we up, this is just a sample, yeah, a free drug
The shipment is in, we done re'd up
But, I don’t trust dudes, like a prenup
They cockroaches, they gotta be bugged
I’m ballin' for real, you gotta D up
I don’t hear you boys, you gotta speak up
What are you guys saying?
I have the chauffeur hold the umbrella over my head when it's not raining

[Outro]
And we wanna let the world know
This is not a diss song either people
We don't diss them we dismiss 'em, ya dig
Recognize or step aside, ya dig
We let the music talk, Drought 3
And by the way, it's Santana, I'm back
It's Weezy!
You dudes gotta stand in the mirror backwards cause you can't face yourself
Assholes
DipSet for life
Cash Money, whaddup
Young Money
