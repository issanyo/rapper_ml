[Hook: Juelz Santana]
Hello? What up nigga
Hello? What up bitch
Who me? I’m doing fine
Hold on, I got that money calling on the other line
My phone clickin’, my phone clickin’
If you ain’t talking bout money, I ain’t tryna’ listen
My phone clickin’, my phone clickin’
I got that phone clickin’, my phone clickin’

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
My phone clickin’, hope that’s the plug
That’s just your girl, I know what she want
My phone clickin’, is that you honey?
Not you bitch, thought I was talking to the money
Phone clickin’, you need something?
My phone clickin’, you need something?
Cheap beef like climaxing
Telling pussy’s, I keep busting
All you do is listen, you air hustling
My phone clickin’, I’m air hustling
Rick Ross when he came out, everyday I’m still hustlin’
Hit the block and I’m head hunting
Big gun like I’m deer hunting
Bring it back like cook crack
Yeah nigga, I still trouble
Blowing money, I’m still stunting
Take mine, I dare someone
Like 2 Chainz I kill weaves, but I send ‘em back with they hair done
My eyes low from the loud, I’m comatose
I need a new safe, my shit done overflowed
Just called the bank, my account on overload
Still got that Novocaine, bitch don’t overdose

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Where my trap junkie? My phone clickin’
You owe me something, and the clock tickin’
My phone clickin’, my bitch drippin’
My work ain’t jumping back, I’m in the kitchen clickin’
Bitch I feel like ?
Traveling the world while you niggas hate
Blew a twenty piece in K.O.D
Other piece in D.O.A
Bitch called me on three-way
Niggas better pre-pay
Cause once I get this work in, I’mma hit the E-way
Pulled up in a Phantom, you don’t know the feeling
Money to the ceiling, tryna’ make a killing
Ain’t got time for these bitches cause I’m on my grind
Clicked over, tell that ho I’m on the other line
