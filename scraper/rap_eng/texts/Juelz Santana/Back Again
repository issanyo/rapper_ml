[Intro: Juelz Santana]
Yeah nigga (okay, y'know)
I heard my man Luca was out
I guess you..

[Chorus: Razah]
(Back again)
Back with my .45, got a new car to drive
Tryin' to stay alive
(Back again)
Same gangsta team, new gangsta lean
Chasin' the fuckin' green
(Back again)
Fitted to the back, throwy well intact
Ladies holla back
(Back again)
This time we're here to stay
Ain't got no time to play
Stay out my fuckin' way

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Now I'm (back again), just like flash was
Bad like Shaft was, react like Cassius
Clay did in the ring with his back up
Against the ropes, jab, jab, back up
It's all for what, all for us, all for bucks
You chumps remind me of mister softee trucks
Icy niggas, banana boat milkshake ice cream niggas
I don't like these niggas, nope
I pop shots, hot Glocks, shoot through vans too
Ooo bop bopa-alu bam boo, move
And I'm fo' really with the milli yo
Oh, leave many holes like the cereal Cheerios
You into funny money, I'm rakin' in silly dough
The type that don't really fold, just sittin' gettin' old
I got the game in a loop kid, kinda like Snoop did
It's more than me, it's more than the music, I'm

[Chorus: Razah {Juelz Santana}]
(Back again)
Back with my .45, got a new car to drive
Tryin' to stay alive
(Back again) {Rocky}
Same gangsta team {I'm back}, new gangsta lean
Chasin' the fuckin' green
(Back again)
Fitted to the back, throwy well intact
Ladies holla back
(Back again)
This time we're here to stay {uhh}
Ain't got no time to play
Stay out my fuckin' way

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
Yeah, come through new coupe Z
Three plus fitty, me plus Jimmy
Speed up slow, ease up quickly
Yeah we puff really, yeah we just silly
Puddy-buddies, yeah he just kills me, shit
And I'm sick in the mind
They don't understand this trife style lifestyle livin' of mine
But still I'm (back again)
Back with my .45, Cadillac that my shorty drives
Maggy-mackin' my shorty's live (back again)
Straight from 445, West five three in Amsterdam
Also known as Gramsterdam (oh!), way before the Santana, man
Long time ago, way before the bandana, damn
Young scrammy scram on the block, hand to hand
Hard, I was slangin' it, straight LaRon James with it
No big star, no big car
One big rock, one big block, I'll go far

[Chorus: Razah]
(Back again)
Back with my .45, got a new car to drive
Tryin' to stay alive
(Back again)
Same gangsta team, new gangsta lean
Chasin' the fuckin' green
(Back again)
Fitted to the back, throwy well intact
Ladies holla back
(Back again)
This time we're here to stay
Ain't got no time to play
Stay out my fuckin' way

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
Now this has been one hell of a year
This has been one hell of a ride, I'm tellin' you guys
They'd thought we'd never survive, Jekyll and Hyde
Or the great American pie, weapons collide
Dead or alive, left with no choice but to um, better our lives
Get up and strive, but um, get up and roll, get up ya know
Get up and go, these motherfuckers ain't lettin' us go (no!)
So we get up and take it, get up and make it happen for us
Nobody can get up and take this
In rappin' we trust, gat packin's a must
It's part of my nature, part of my wake up
Part of my waist yup, pardon my waist chump
For this part of my waist chump, come part of your face, yup (Yeah) It's Santana, part of the great stuff
But really man, pardon I'm great chump

[Chorus: Razah]
(Back again)
Back with my .45, got a new car to drive
Tryin' to stay alive
(Back again)
Same gangsta team, new gangsta lean
Chasin' the fuckin' green
(Back again)
Fitted to the back, throwy well intact
Ladies holla back
(Back again)
This time we're here to stay
Ain't got no time to play
Stay out my fuckin' way
