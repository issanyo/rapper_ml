[Intro]
Uh-ohhhh!
Cold cold time again baby
I'm back in the, back in the, back in the building
Juelz Santana (Aye!)
Dip Set bitch
I need all my soldiers and my block men to stand up for me
It's 'bout that time you know

[Hook]
My hood, my city, my side
Whatever you wanna call it nigga I ride
My town, my corner, my block
Whatever you wanna call it nigga I rock
My state, my strip, my ave
Whatever you wanna call it nigga I'm bad
My building, my porch, my stoop
Whatever you wanna call it nigga I'm proof

[Juelz Santana]
Straight for paper
Paper chaser
Gangsta gangsta
Gangsta gangsta
I know my block is a crazy zoo
But it got me crazy glued (stuck)
I got to make these moves
So I hustle the hardest (drugs)
I got no team
Just a connect and a couple of partners
I keep my street niggas, my street niggas (yup)
I keep my cheese niggas, my cheese niggas (Yup)
I keep my beef niggas, my beef niggas (yup)
And I keep my weed niggas, my weed niggas
Keep business business, keep pleasure pleasure
And I never mix it, ever ever
Yeah the code of the street
Eyes open don't sleep
(whoop-whoop-whoop-whoop)
There go the police
That's why you catch me moving through dolo
Moving through solo, steel weapon, still reppin'

[Hook]

[Hell Rell]
Niggas always catching bodies in the hood (yup)
Stay shootin up a party in the hood (uh-uh)
Mafia ties, I'm like Gotti in the hood
Tint a hoopty or the black Maserati through the hood
Remember when we used to play karate in the hood (remember)
Now my rims look like ninja stars
Nigga I've been a star (been a star)
I remember when I didn't have shit to borrow (I ain't have shit)
Now I can lend you a couple of clips
You hungry homey you could eat a couple of clips
Come through my strip, you gon see niggas G'd up cuz
We slangers (slangers)
Gang bangers (east-side)
And when it comes to squaley we strangers, plus
I keep my thug niggas, my thug niggas
I keep my blood niggas, my blood niggas
Spend it all I ain't no cheap ass nigga
I'm always gonna ride cause I'm a weed sack nigga, YUP!

[Hook]

[Juelz Santana]
I represent mine to the fullest (oh yeah)
I represent the grind to the fullest (oh yeah)
I represent scar time, bar time, hard times
Yeah, our time to the fullest (oh yeah)
We need to have a million man march again
We need to have a million man march up in
The white house start a million man argument
Like Bush why a million men starving and sh-
My city, my town, my hood
Whatever you wanna call it nigga what's good
We riders, we rollers, we survivors, we soldiers
We don't crack under pressure
We relaxed under pressure
Most of all, we don't rat under pressure
We bang, and we pitch this crack
'Till the cops shut us down or our wigs pushed back

[Hook] - repeat to fade
