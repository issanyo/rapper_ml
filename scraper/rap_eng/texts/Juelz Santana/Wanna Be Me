They don't wanna see me
They just wanna be me!
(Fuck em, I'm getting money!)
Uh, they don't wanna see me
They just wanna be me!
(Fuck em, I'm getting money!)
They don't wanna see me (yeah)
They just wanna be me!
(They just wanna be me!
They don't wanna see me (yeah)
They just wanna be me!
(Fuck em, I'm getting money!)
They don't wanna see me
(They just wanna be me!
They just wanna be me!
They don't wanna see me (yeah, yeah)
They just wanna be me!

(Verse:1)
They don't wanna see me, they just wanna be me
Yeah, I'm getting money, but your bitch gave me a freeby
Yeah, all my bitches freaky, that money's what they bring me
Like a boss that's how they greet me
Like a king that's how they treat me
Oh, she like wearing gold, I call that bitch Nefertiti
Got a bitch that don't speak English
I bought her up back from Tahiti!
Pull up to the club, tell her park my shit
Ninja Turtle whip, I'm on the hard top shit!
Just bought me a new Beamer, just bought me a new Benz
Just caught my old bitch, told her, "bring some new friends!"
Half of ticket, that's loose changed
My car need two lanes
New Bentley, call that, sit down, move aside!

(Hook)

(Verse:2)
They just wanna be me, tell them they can't be me!
Everyday fresh tag, swag on graffiti!
Your girl don't wanna leave me, she blowing on my dick
Told her blow and make a wish, and out will come a genie
Since a youngin, bitch up in that nigga ass, where is she?
Fly into Skeevy pockets all Luigi
Leave that pussy leaking then I'm gone, Houdini!
I ain't got no worries, just a strong 30
I watch these niggas trying to clone me
So now as fuck 'em, do my dirt up on my lawn, nigga!
I equipped for the bullshit
Extended clip for the bullshit!
