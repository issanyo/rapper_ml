[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
I know I always say it's about me, ain't it baby?
But every time you see me
I'm with two or three ladies
With two other chains
Ain't nothing change
But I ain't with them lames
So everything's okay
I do this like everyday
Take your mind, elevate
Victor Cruz in that pussy when I touch down I celebrate
Don't hesitate when I'm in it
Damn right I'm gettin' it
Round round I'm in it
It's mine I spend it
Everyday I wake up
Pillow full of her makeup
Hundred dollar for the shape up
Steak sauce, A1
And when I do this
I get brained like tutors
And I got that drank
All we need is some juicers

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that don't really need you
Girl I know how much you really want somebody
Want somebody that ain't trying to keep
You heard what I said, that could put you to bed
That ain't tryin' to love you baby, just fuck you instead
And don't tell 'em nothing baby, you know that I'm comin' baby
Just hit up my phone whenever you need you some company
Got this drank in my cup, oh yeah
I got this drank in my cup
I got this drank in my cup, cup, cup

[Verse 2: Kirko Bangz]
I done came down, hold up
Up'out this way, roll up
And if ya car ain't poking ya chokin' mayne
I'm from Texas mayne (Texas mayne)
I'm H-town, playa mayne
Yo girl lovin' my playa ways
I'm coming through with those 'Sace shades, just to match my pinky ring
Flippin' through, they be rapped on
When I'm in my city I'm tippin' off
24's, 84's double cup you know I'm throwed
Wood grain, Diamond chain
Young Kirk, most shining mayne
Bad chick on my side
Donaraque, switching lanes
Drapped up, dripped out
H-town know what I'm talkin' about
Pull up, Drop the top
I'm holdin' mayne in their parking lot
I love the feeling of 84's
Coming down, slamming doors
I break'em off, I'm from the South
(H-Town all in ya mouth)

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Girl I know how much you really want somebody

[Verse 3: Juelz Santana]
New Ferrari, watching my lanes (lanes)
Bad bitch, she's watching the frame (frame)
That's yo girl? Pardon me
It's not gonna change
She wanna nigga that be ballin'
Not watching the game
Double cup of that lean (swag)
20 stuffed in my jean (swag)
So fresh, so clean, Alexander Mcqueen (swag)
She call you when she wanna shop
She call me when she want the cock
Started playin' some Lil Wayne
While she li-li-licked me like a lollipop
She just want me to climb on her
She climax whenever I'm on her
I ain't gotta spend a dime on her
Happy that a nigga like me got time for her
You in the party, I am the party
You stand around, I stand out
When she with me she got her legs up
When she with you she got her hand out
She hit me like come get me
Next thing you know she with me
You care 'bout her whereabouts
All I do is let her out
Same water we're fishin'
But my bait is different
So don't be surprised if it's your bitch I'm reeling
Face it you basic and I'm so appealing
Yo shit just ordinary, my shit extraordinary
G'd up, bossed up
She like that, I'm like that
Yo girlfriend want a nigga like me cause you just ain't like that
