[Intro: Scarface sample]
"You know Frank, if anyone ever wanted to assassinate you, you wouldn't be too hard to find
(Assassinate me? Who the hell would wanna kill me? I got nothing but friends!)
You never know…"

[Chorus]
I know they love me nigga, I know they do (I know they do)
I know they love me baby, I know they do (know they do)
I know they love me baby, I know they love me (Melo, Melo)
I know they love me baby, I know they do

I know they love me baby, I know they do
I know they love me baby, I know they do

[Verse 1: Young Melo]
Got the foreign double-parked in the ghetto (skrt, skrt)
Drop the bag on that rose gold, yellow
They must be rockstars wearing all that metal (wow, Melo, Melo)
I know they love me, yeah I know they do (yeah we love you)
If she too old to love me bet her daughter do (I know she love me)
Blow a hundred in the club that's promotional
If you flying private baby why he coaching you?
Hold up wait (hold up, hold up)
Can I be honest (can I?)
Light showers and it still covers the counters
They watching me I should be paid by the hour (pay per view)
Brooklyn we did it, kill 'em, send 'em flowers

[Chorus]
I know they love me nigga, I know they do (I know they do)
I know they love me baby, I know they do (know they do)
I know they love me baby, that ain't the problem (Melo, Melo)

That’s your bitch I know she want me, yeah I know she do (know she do)
Do not fuck me that's what your hoe should do
But she a hoe, she gon' do it if she told her to
I'm bout to slot my mic in the vocal booth (in the vocal booth)
She look like she ride the mic, yeah I know she do (know she do)
She love that money more than you and you know she do (know she do)
And I get more money than you so you know the rule
Got the .40 on me, you can see it poking through (that's right)
If I ain't got it on me bet one of my homies do (okay)
Fuck up a check every day, yeah you know I do (every day)
Collect cash all day call me toking booth (nigga ay!)

[Verse 3: Sen City]
Dropped that lupus on 'em, told them ain't no cure for that
Little sporty beemer dipping, nah you relax (skrt)
They don't love you, line you up like a barber would (word)
Turn your ass into steak in front of starving wolves (get 'em)
Bricks of money, roof the only thing that's folding (only thing that's folding)
Police said slow down, get to strolling
Twenty piece a day and we still growing (and we still growing)
They listening so scratch that, we just joking (haah)
M.O.B. and Chainswingers still alma mater (alma mater)
Standing over stoves where it's muggy like nirvana (muggy like nirvana)
She ain't my girl, it's complicated but I got her (boo)
Pussy ain't the only thing that's left at the Ramada (City!)

[Chorus]
I know they love me nigga, I know they do (I know they do)
I know they love me baby, I know they do (know they do)
I know they love me baby, I know they love me (Melo, Melo)
I know they love me baby, I know they do
I know they love me baby, that ain't the problem
I'm a get money nigga like I'm from Harlem (wooo)
I know they love me baby, I know they do
I know they love me baby, I know they do
