[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
Saw my life slippin' bunch of minor setbacks
Now it's time to get it, focus on the get back
Everything I lost yeah it's time to get back
Niggas wasn't with me, won't be with me when I get back
Get back, get back it's the fuckin' get back
Niggas touched mine, you know I'ma get back
Stretch that, it's the fuckin' get back, get back
Nigga it's time to get back

[Bridge: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]
I need good vibes and no problems
Good trees where ever we go the hoes follow
Chinese for dinner yeah that was old problems
Pillow talkin' and switchin' up that's a hoes problem
You know that, I'm talkin' bout that you know what
You know what, we doin' nigga you know what
You know what, we doin' yeah yeah you know what
You know that, I'm talkin' bout that you know what

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Real niggas on the rise
Fake niggas we despise
Real niggas on the rise
Fake niggas we despise
Lil boy fresh all grown up
Still got a trunk full of that you know what
Still hit a nigga up with that you know what
She slapped your hoe and gave her that you know what
Can't let the fast money slow up
Show off for show out, everytime I show up
Yeah, on the piece like a steady cam
Young nigga ballin' hard, jelly fam
Whippin' so much wish I had a extra hand
Bad as MJ, so fly I might never land
Young niggas winnin' that's they only fear
They gave Bobby and them boys like a hundred years
These days we just free slaves
Programmed to think that things change
Prayin' for my niggas that got court today
I got it on me, pray I don't get caught today

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]]
Saw my life slippin' bunch of minor setbacks
Now it's time to get it, focus on the get back
Everything I lost yeah it's time to get back
Niggas wasn't with me, won't be with me when I get back
Get back, get back it's the fuckin' get back
Niggas touched mine, you know I'ma get back
Stretch that, it's the fuckin' get back, get back
Nigga it's time to get back

[Bridge: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]]
I need good vibes and no problems
Good trees where ever we go the hoes follow
Chinese for dinner yeah that was old problems
Pillow talkin' and switchin' up that's a hoes problem
You know that, I'm talkin' bout that you know what
You know what, we doin' nigga you know what
You know what, we doin' yeah yeah you know what
You know that, I'm talkin' bout that you know what

[Verse 2: Juelz Santana]
They gotta steal it like the Knicks, can't win for shit
Man, this for Eric Garner and Kalief Browder
Be smarter when you always grab the heat, boy
Don't let a fuck nigga trick you off the street, boy
Long trips up the road gotta get it sold
Spend more than you niggas sold on tour
Lord knows I had to rose a 20 years old
Ridin' for my niggas 'til the end of the road
Remember nights, hot as fuck no AC
Small crib we was bunched, no Brady
Before you heard of Perry boy I had Katy
Sheesh, gotta keep the piece in arms reach
I watch love change in a heartbeat
Seen a black rose break through the concrete
Blunt full of brocolli, niggas wasn't for me
Like my name on a jersey I had to put them behind me

[Chorus: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]]
Saw my life slippin' bunch of minor setbacks
Now it's time to get it, focus on the get back
Everything I lost yeah it's time to get back
Niggas wasn't with me, won't be with me when I get back
Get back, get back it's the fuckin' get back
Niggas touched mine, you know I'ma get back
Stretch that, it's the fuckin' get back, get back
Nigga it's time to get back

[Bridge: A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie]]
I need good vibes and no problems
Good trees where ever we go the hoes follow
Chinese for dinner yeah that was old problems
Pillow talkin' and switchin' up that's a hoes problem
You know that, I'm talkin' bout that you know what
You know what, we doin' nigga you know what
You know what, we doin' yeah yeah you know what
You know that, I'm talkin' bout that you know what
