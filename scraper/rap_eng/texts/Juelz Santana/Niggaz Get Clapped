(feat. Gravy & JR Writer)

[Verse 1: Juelz Santana]
Im Still Poppin A Roog-A-Dook
Still Hoppin In The Newest Coupes
Still Got Me A Hula Hoop
Still Got Me From Off The Toon (Yeah!)
And She Will Swallow A Hula Hoop
Come To, She Will Swallow Some Juicy Fruit
All She Needs Is A Bed, Bottle And A Lucy Lius
And She Go Like A Gear Throttle In Mula Shoes
My Lifes Cloudy
Tight Rowdy
Bad Boys 2 The Hood Mite Allow Me
I Bow These Streets To The Dirt
I Drown These Beats With A Verse U Fuckin Wit Me
I Proudly Squeeze It And Murk
And A Zee Wit The Doors Up Speedin Thru Forester
All Wagner Skeetin A Broad Up
I Believe Its A Daughter
Ill See Ya Tomorrow

[Chorus:]
Niggas Get Jacked Wit, I Unn Care Who U Rap With
I See U Shinin Brotha Man, Take Off That Shit
U Niggas Ain't Learn Yet, Ya Hustlin Backwards
I Sell Drugs, Hooks, Bullets And Rachets
Niggas Get Jacked With, I Unn Care Who U Rap With
I See U Shinin Brotha Man, Take Off That Shit
U Niggas Ain't Learn Yet, Ya Hustlin Backwards
I Sell Drugs, Hooks, Bullets And Rachets

[Verse 2: Gravy]
Yo Im A Crook When I Spit It
I Dunn Even Gotta Write It
Im A Star Man, Got The Whole Hood Excited
Lettos, Baking Soda, Cocaine, Bottled Water
Let It Drop, Bag It Up, Read The Scale, Add It Up
Mars Stars Get Set, Y'all Niggas'll Get Wet
Who Wouldve Ever Thought Man, Gravy And Dipset
Im Baggin Em And Crushin Em (Eh!)
Chicks Wanna Fuck With Em (Eh!)
But I Ain't Trustin Em, Never Lovin Em (Eh!)
The Nervin Em, Im Servin Em, Fans Want A Word With Him
Cuz The Flow Is Murderin Em
Yo My Shits Hot, Y'all Niggas'll Get Dropped, Get Shot
We Handled That Coke Nigga, Wrap It Up In Ziploc
You'se A Homo Thug, Wit Ya Toes Out Of Flip Flops
Wait Till My Shit Drops, After Ya Shit Flops
Im Highly Anticipated, Niggas Mad I Made It
So They Hate It While I Wait It
Im So Disturbin I Got 32 Ways To Handle U Niggas Like Julius Erving Berwitz

[Verse 3: Jr Writer]
Niggas Get Jacked With, I Unn Care Who U Rap With
I See U Shinin Brotha Man, Take Off That Shit
U Niggas Ain't Learn Yet, Ya Hustlin Backwards
I Sell Drugs, Hooks, Bullets And Rachets
Niggas Get Jacked With, I Unn Care Who U Rap With
I See U Shinin Brotha Man, Take Off That Shit
U Niggas Ain't Learn Yet, Ya Hustlin Backwards
I Sell Drugs, Hooks, Bullets And Rachets

Uh, The Dips A Fire, Getcha Flyers
Posters, Y'all Jokesters Like Richard Pryor
Niggas Say I Ain't A Pimp That Pricks A Liar
I Mite Drive Thru The Hood In A Whip Rekaya
Bump In A Joint, Bump Her A Joint
Puffin Like This Is Nothing
This Just Something A Bump
Watchu Kno About Hustlin Appoints
It Get Crazy At Nights
Heads And Dopefins Cravin For White, Right?
Thats The 80s Delight
Its So Much Niggas Wit Rocks That Look Like A Palestanian Fight
But I Roll Wit Arabian Nights
Taliban, Pakistan
Man About 80 In Sight
80 More In The Bushes, Baby Thats Right
Anotha 80 On The Roof Just Waitin To Bout
Hate It, Thats Life
I Stay In With The Boxers
Open Up My Sun Roof And Stay In Da Boxa
With Cannon A Glock Ya
Cannons'll Pop Ya
Startin With Ur Nana
Grandma And Papa
Mama, Kids, Ram In Ur Casa
U Gon Need Nurses, Ambulance, Doctors
U Ran Wit The Coppas
I Ran Wit The Coblas
Platinum Why As Ran In The Copper
Damn This Imposter, U Den Ran From Schemes
I Den Ran Sum Schemes That Ran For Some Chocolate
Care Man I Got Cha
U Ain't Even Got To Spit
Soon As I Start The Click
I Hand-Do The Rossla
I Hand-Do Wit Rosters
The Hand-Dos With Rosters
The Boy Is Hot, Hot Damn
Hand Him An Oscar

Delirando Oh Its A Prada
U Can Tell I Spend Her, Whole Enchilada
Then On 5th Ave, Big Bag Shit Dag
Holy Moly Mother Of God, Who Is This Bad?

Ritz Sick Big Pad
Five Bites Six Jags
Rise Like Six Flags

Headshot, Bed Cop, Stitched Abs, Piss Bag

[Chorus:]
