I'm hot, you ain't
I'm what you wanna be but you can't
I'm the man, you a fan
You love when they bangin' my jam
I, I, I do it big, nigga
I, I, I do it big, nigga
I, I, I do it big, nigga
I, I, I do it big, nigga

Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
The realest nigga to do it, boy and I ain't fuckin' with ya
I got a agenda to end you to market
I don't know if you niggas noticed but I'm just gettin' started
Now listen, I do it big, mo' fucka
From the cradle to the grave that's how I live, mo' fucka
That's how I live, we don't back down from niggas
We back down to niggas who back down to niggas
Let's get back to the situation in hand
I'm the man, shit is startin' to go exactly how I planned
I, I'm 'bout to do it big, boy
Start understanding and recognizing me as a big boy
I'm down for the cause, I'm down for the wars
I'm down for the beef, I'm down for the brawls
I'm down for the peace, I'm down for it all
Down for whatever the situation calls
For, big pistols with them big clip fulls
If not, it ain't shit and I don't deal with kid issues
Get this, brotha, this kid's gutter
I ain't a joker I ain't related to Chris Tucker
I ain't cool with Eddie Murphy, Dave Chapelle ain't my big brotha
You know how I get, brotha, when I'm on my shit, brotha
I ain't close with Dwayne's family, that toast in my hand's deadly
You roll up, I bang, hear me?

I'm hot, you ain't
I'm what you wanna be but you can't
I'm the man, you a fan
You love when they bangin' my jam
I, I, I do it big, nigga
I, I, I do it big, nigga
I, I, I do it big, nigga
I, I, I do it big, nigga
