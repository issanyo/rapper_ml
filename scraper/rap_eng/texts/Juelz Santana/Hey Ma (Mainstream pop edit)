Now I was down town clubbin, ladies night
Seen shorty she was crazy right
And I approach baby like
Ma, What's your age and type?
She looked at me and said you's a baby right?
I told her, I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And I know what the ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe
Come with me come stay the night
She looked at me laughin', like boy your game is tight
I'm laughin back like sure you're right
Get in the car
And don't touch nothin', sit in the car
Lets discuss somethin'
Either we lovin or I'll see you tomorrow
Now we speedin' up the westside
Hand creepin' up her left side, ready to do it
Ready to bone, ready for dome
55th exit, damn, damn already we home
Now let's get it on

Hey ma (what's up) lets slide (alright) alright
And we gonna get it on tonight
You smoke (I smoke) I drink (me too) well good

Got drops (got Coupes) got Trucks (got Jeeps) alright
Cuz we gon take a ride tonight
So ma (what's up) let's slide (alright) alright
And we gonna get it on tonight

Now that I got a girl, my ex wanna holla and spit
Told me to acknowledge her quick

On that Dave Hallister tip

I promise you dick, usually have a problem with chicks
They all say i'm rotten and rich
But not her, boo be's real
High heel dooby feel, plus got them gucci nails, uh
You a cutie still, and this my down girl too
Ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzies, Suzuki wheels
To the jacuzzi, I tell you my boo be's real
I mean she do be winning, louie spinnin
Go to the crib she got the gucci linen
I see boo be grinning
She looked and said Cam, I know that you be sinnin'
Naw, I'm a changed man, look at the range mam
I got a whole new game plan
Looked and said that's nothing but game Cam
She was right; she was up in the range man
Droped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell
That's right I had to call up L

Yo L, what up, I hit, what else, plus dome, say word
