Juelz Santana
Don't wanna play around we'll squeeze bananas
(Santana x6)

[verse 1]
Okay, I'm reloaded
Okay the heats loaded
Okay now we rollin
Okay, cut! (Santana)
My 44 piece talking
Sound oh-so-sweet talking
Do more, more street talking
Than Stone Cold Steve Austin
And I bang it well
Slang it well
Shave it well
Hell, you looking at a preview of The Matrix twelve
L rock them, I'm here to shake the bells
Shake ya bells
What's my name...? (Santana)
You got that there right
I'm not that queer type
Nasty behind the wheel, but my mind ain't steered right
Fuck driving reckless
My mind is reckless
Plus I stay with two timed crime offenders
I can't give it up (nope)
Like an old man who can't get it up
I'm not a man till it's up
So now I'm rapping bad, I'm back I'm badder
Shit y'all probably think I'm taking rap Viagra
Got as many songs as Pac had, on lock stash
I could pop songs, just like I pop tags
I do not brag
Just watch fag
I'm here to get the keys to the lock back
Open the door, close it and relock that
Don't touch stop that it's locked black
And guess what... I'm back!

I've got a problem, his name is Santana
Don't wanna play around, we'll squeeze bananas
(Santana x6)

[verse 2]
Say hello to my little friend
Hello, for I pull again
And show you my bullets man
Hello, my name please (Santana)
Straight blam the llama
For cake stand behind ya
And make plans to drop ya, I ain't Aunt Jemima (nope)
I ain't here to wine ya
I ain't here to dine ya
I came here to pop ya
And I came here for lobster
The whole damn shebang, and they ain't bring the pasta
Now I got to be rude
They ain't brought me my food
I'm not gon be used
These shots gon eat through
And this kids small body
With this big long shotty
Well that'll just make shit hit all sloppy
Straight out the pot, I'm ready
Straight out like rock, I'm ready
Or more proper, I'm straight out like hot spaghetti
It's rock and roll time
It's lock and load time
Adios amigo, gotta go time
But I'll be right back at you
Twice back at you
Like Christ back at you
You be like damn that's one nice ass rapper
I kinda like that rapper
I wanna be like that rapper (nope)
But if you bite that rapper
I might bite back at you
With that rifle at you
I know that might sound bad but....
I'm back!
