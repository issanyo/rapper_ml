[Jim Jones]
Louie belts with the guns still tucked in em, whats up
New cars, bad bitches gettin fucked in em, nasty
My “Billie Jeans” got 30 thousand bucks in em,im loaded
He’s a “get money nygga”fuck with em
Til the FEDs come after us
Vampire life, true blood….Dracula
I double park cars and back traffic up
You can hear the fly bitches say “He actin up!”
Yeah bytch, I always stay actin up
I’ll have you and you girlfriend both lappin up, listen
And then she dropped it like it’s hot and tried to back it up
I fukked her brains out and then I told her I’ll get back at her
We drank Rose til we laughed it up
Treat bitches like Ferrari’s…gas em up
She was wearin pumps, headed to the Trump
Ridin shotti in the Mazi dropped the top UHHHH!

[Chorus]
[Camron]
The Aston…had to rag it out, paper plate tag it out
Bottle after bottle, Vado wit me and Snagz is out
So the cash is out, you know what that about
I need you “ATM” ma….A$s To Mouth
Then “MTA”….Mouth To A$s
The handcuffs on you….Alcatraz
So run with the kid, it’s coke in the house, guns in the crib
One to your lid, under a bridge, “And my dudes fukkin with me!”
And forget what you heard, get you a bird, and hit up the curb
I lit up the herb, I’m sick wit the words, “Man, who fukkin wit me?!”
I’ma treat em like Cool C and my man Steady B
“Bum, Diddily, Diddily” yeah I sell “Heavy D!”

[Chorus]
[Juelz Santana]
Catch me drivin the Phantom like it’s a sports car
2 door, drop head, top less, sports bra
Red bone passenger and she ain’t got on no bra
No panties….freaky….nasty….porn star
I be at the club ballin….All-Star
Wit more bottles at my table than a Sports Bar
It look like we at a “Champagne Campaign”
We do the damn thang and you won't do a damn thang!
2 steppin, bytch I got my new Airs on
I been fly since a baby….I was “Air Borne”
Lookin at me is like lookin at a Lear fly
I’m so fly I’m bout start my own airline!
