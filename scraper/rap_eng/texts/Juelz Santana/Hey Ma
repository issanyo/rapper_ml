So ma (wassup) Let's slide (all right)
All right - and we gon' get it on tonight

[Verse 1: Goody Grace]
Yo, now I was downtown clubbing, ladies night
Seen shorty, she was crazy right
And I approach baby like: "Ma, what's your age and type?"
She looked at me and said, you's a baby, right
I told her I'm 18 and live a crazy life
Plus I'll tell you what the 80's like
And I know what ladies like
Need a man that's polite, listens and takes advice
I could be all three, plus I can lay the pipe
Come with me, come stay the night
She looked at me laughing; like "boy, your game is tight"
I'm laughin' back like, sure you're right, get in the car
And don't touch nothing, sit in the car
Let's discuss something, either we loving or I'll see you tomorrow
Now we speeding up the West Side
Hand creepin up her left side, I'm ready to do it
Ready to bone, ready for dome
55th exit, damn, damn, already we home
Now let's get it on

[Hook: Gnash & (Rosa Beales)]

[Verse 2: Gnash]
Now that I got a girl, my ex wanna holla and spit
Told me to acknowledge her quick
She like "Gnash, stop fronting on that Dave Hollister tip
Come over let's swallow and sip." I'm like: "momma is sick
I promise you dick, usually have a problem with chicks
(Why?) They all say I'm rotten and rich"
But not her, boobies' real, high heel dooby feel
Plus got them Gucci nails
You a cutie still
And this my down girl too - ain't no groupie deal
We left the movies with Uzis, Suzuki wheels
To the jacuzzi, I tell you, my boo be's real
I mean she do be winnin', Louis spinnin'
Go to the crib, she got the Gucci linen
I see boo be grinnin'
She looked and said: "Gnash, I know that you be sinnin"
"Naw! I'm a changed man, look at the Range, ma'am
(Look) I got a whole new game plan"
Looked and said: "That's nothing but game, Gnash"
She was right, she was up in the Range, man
Dropped her off at the L, now I'm flippin' the cell
That's right, I had to call up L

[Gnash & (4e)]
Yo L (what up?) I hit (what else)
Plus dome (say word) and we got it on tonight
