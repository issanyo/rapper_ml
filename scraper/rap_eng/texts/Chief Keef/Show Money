[Hook]

Bitch, I got show money, Dro money, fucked your bitch, got ho money
Come on the block, lay a bitch nigga down, now I'm walking around with your money
I don't save the shit, I blow money, hit the stadium and I throw hundreds
Smoking on the dank while I'm dranking on the drank, I be laughing to the bank, it's so funny

[Verse 1]

Bitch, I got show money, Dro money, and a trap fit that get more money
Pull on up, weed up, bring it back, I ain't never had to touch my old money
I can't walk around with no money, ?
These niggas broke, they ain't got no money, I need to rob a stripper for that pole money
Me and Sosa ride around with toasters, no stash boxes and no hoochies
We smoking dope, and we ?, gotta wet a nigga up like a ocean
I'm sipping lean, feeling like a fiend, and I'm walking around in slow motion
No movin, nigga four-o totin'
I'm in ? smoking swisher sweets, and they smoking dope, I call it Chief Keef
GBE, SB, SB ball around 3 deep with a hundred heat
In the hotel with a hundred freaks, looking like a sold like a hundred keys
Only chains on me, only thangs on me, best believe GBE gone bang with me

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]

Getting verse money like blow money, I got trunk money and old money
It's Sosa baby and Ooch baby, run up on you with the pipe, take your money
Broke niggas be so funny, got a red nose with no money
Put the pipe to your face for your money, hit the stadium with Slutty Boyz, global money
Got bank accounts, that's more money, Fendi belt, four hundred
Nikes on my feet, they five hundred, I use hundreds if my nose running
For Slutty Boyz, I'll blow something, down to the ground like I'm low something
Niggas talking drunk, shoot him sober something, cause GBE, we don't tote for nothing
???, counting newer money with my older money
Your money, your bro money, your momma money, your ho money
Smoking on dank while I'm sipping on drank while I'm laughing to the bank, it's so funny
Smoking on dank while I'm sipping on drank while I'm laughing to the bank, it's so funny
