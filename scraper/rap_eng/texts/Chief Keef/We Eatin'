[Verse 1: Boss Brick]
All I do is grind flip a brick triple profit
Hood celebrity hit the block now its on and poppin'
Time is money so I always work around the clock
Watch out for them thirsty hoes plus them crooked cops
I be hitting licks, with a project bitch
Flipping racks on racks
You could call me hood rich
True religion jeans, filled up with that cream
Shout out to my team, ho we EMG
I'm getting paid, like everyday
All I pay to pop em sipping Hennesy and Alize
I be sipping lean like I'm from the H
I'm married to the mob so my money stack like wedding cakes
I'm tatted up, I be smoking big blunts
I prefer the finer things, I'm raised out the slum
Connected on the map from the Sota to the Chi
We eating in this bitch I'm bout to go worldwide

[Hook x2]
From the sota to the Chi damn right we eatin'
Boss Brick and Chief Keef damn right we eatin'
Breaking down a brick, call it government cheese
Breaking down a brick, call it government cheese

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Lots of clothes and bankrolls so you know I'm eatin'
I'm smokin' on this dope bitch I'm soul seein'
I got bands in my pocket and I know you see it
Rocking a Fendi belt, you get a Fendi beatin'
Sosa mothafucka bitch I'm semi beatin'
That choppa took yo life and you couldn't see it
Ashes on my Trus shit I don't like
Had to take em off, and they was all white
Shooting pistols we can do that all night
We don't talk and we don't fight
Reese out the cut shoot your momma up
We shootin' niggas up they can't get down with us
GBE we just signed with Interscope
Spend my money on Gucci clothes and penny loafers
It's GBE we just signed with Interscope
Spend my money on Gucci clothes and penny loafers
