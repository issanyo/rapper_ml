[Hook]
I tell my niggas, find Nemo, find Nemo, find Nemo
I tell my niggas, find Lil Gay, find Kemo, and find Nemo
When we see ya, Terentino
Pistols be Terentino
Who I trust? Me, Al Pacino
Come through clapping out a Venom

[Verse 1]
Come through busting out the trap like what to the fuck
Buck to the buck, cut to the cut
Gun short, it'll smoke a nigga like a duck like dududu
Hop in my truck, caught a nigga lacking, caught him by the bleechers
The other bleechers, But I didn't see nothing
I'mma shoot [?] cause it's me and Nina and Reefer
Leave a nigga in the ER
Car faster than a Cheetah
Come to your block, me and two Glocks, rocking ya porch and leave ya
I ain't turnt up, I'm T'd up
Take the bail for [?]
Got ugly ass throw away guns, and some cute ass keepers
I told my boys to getcha, boy, don't get got
Come up in your kitchen, shooting up your pots
Shooting up your dishes with some guns with knives
Lookin' for ya nigga, where ya at?
Sneak dissin' where ya [?] at?
I'm king Mufasa, but I ain't no Simba yet
But I got KayKay, that's my little princess
Gave my nigga a golden spoon, like, could you cook with that?
I'm coolin' with my young niggas, don't start up, then it's done with ya
Black guy come through shooting up cars nigga
Three hundred come shooting up Mars nigga

[Hook]
Find Nemo, find Nemo, find Nemo
I tell my niggas, find Lil Gay, find Kemo, and find Nemo
When we see ya, Terentino
Pistols be Terentino
Who I trust? Me, Al Pacino
Come through clapping out a Venom
