[Intro]
Pull up, and I glo
Pull up, in that woah

I eat spinach tho, nigga
Money shit, hundreds fifties tho

[Hook]
Pull up and I glo, pulled up in that wow, wait
I ain't finish tho, all I eat is spinach tho
Money shit, fifty shit
Hundred shit, twenty shit
Plenty shit, I get all that money then I spend the shit
Flexing on these niggas, ain't I
I can buy a Bentley, can't I
I can have your bitch, can't I
I am not a bitch, am I
'Member smoking earthy earthy
Niggas smoking dirty dirty
Niggas untrustworthy worthy
Bitches untrustworthy worthy

[Verse 1]
Click clack pow, girl I know you heard it
My car, girl I know you heard it
Pulling out that guap, girl I know you heard it
My song, girl I know you heard it
Niggas flexing like they don't know me
Pull up in that motherfucking truck, macaroni time
Buck buck, catch a nigga lacking, nigga, tough luck
Tough luck, buck buck, buck buck, buck buck
Your earrings are my lunch money
I swear you niggas so fucking funny
Your baby on my line, dummy
But you be calling her for money
Pull up in a Lamb with the gat to the back
Click clack nigga, rat to the tat
Me and my niggas staying back to the back
Your niggas pussy, that's a cat in a cat
Green eggs and ham, cat in a hat
Fuck I look like with my hat to the back
Up my pole nigga, bitch go brrah
Brrah, brrah, grrat to the grrat

[Hook]
Pull up and I glo, pulled up in that wow, wait
I ain't finish tho, all I eat is spinach tho
Money shit, fifty shit

Plenty shit, I get all that money then I spend the shit
Flexing on these niggas, ain't I
I can buy a Bentley, can't I
I can have your bitch, can't I
I am not a bitch, am I
'Member smoking earthy earthy
Niggas smoking dirty dirty
Niggas untrustworthy worthy
Bitches untrustworthy worthy

[Verse 2]
Pulled up, hopped out
Where it's at? Glocks out
Throwing bullets, rocks out
Rock out with my Glock out
No lacking, watch out
Pull up with the mops out
Mop your ass up, do the dishes then I'm out
Bag on my llama
Grrat on my chopper
Flocka like Waka
Block a bumbaclot up
Pull up, I park up
Handicapped my autostick
With this shit, and this clip, I pulled up with this bitch whip
Nigga better get your crip
Lace up, nigga better not let slip
Got a 45 on my hip
Let a it grip, then dip
Then hop up in my whip
Smoking gas out my face, that zip
Going 'round in space in a ship
Young nigga ain't faking it here
Pull up straight to the strip

[Hook]
Pull up and I glo, pulled up in that wow, wait
I ain't finish tho, all I eat is spinach tho
Money shit, fifty shit
Hundred shit, twenty shit
Plenty shit, I get all that money then I spend the shit
Flexing on these niggas, ain't I
I can buy a Bentley, can't I
I can have your bitch, can't I
I am not a bitch, am I
