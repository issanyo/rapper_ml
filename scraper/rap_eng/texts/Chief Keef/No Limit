[Verse 1: Ballout]
I'm in a meeting right now tryna post a big deal
At the car wash you know I'm gettin' detailed
Ima do 200, you better put on a seatbelt
Red light, green light
I'm doing a fish tail

[Hook: Ballout]
She callin' me poppa cause I carry big bills
Engine a V12 it won't even sit still
New rolley white diamonds I bought it off fish scale
Ballout baby you can call me "fish tail"
In the T.I. breakin' bags down on a big scale
That's my trap phone (beep) goin' off like a bell
Buy a new car for a new car smell
Back to back we speed racing, we'll leave 12

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Went and got a carwash and told Ak don't miss a spot
Got a new carbon and we not gon' miss a block (aye)
Nah it ain't no lil ceasars but you block gon get it hot
And these bullets longer than a line at In-n-Out
Fuck a bitch so quick she callin' me a minute man
Got that eeny meeny miny mo for many, many man
And I got enough for any semi man
And I named the drum "Drummond" but he not from Michigan
Diamonds blinging like I got em' out a pyramid
Bitch don't call me Chief Keef call me "I don't give a shit"
Smack a nigga with the lean bottle in the head
Was gon' wrap my shit orange, but think I'm gon wrap it red (aye)

[Hook: Ballout]
She callin' me poppa cause I carry big bills
Engine a V12 it won't even sit still
New rolley white diamonds I bought it off fish scale
Ballout baby you can call me "fish tail"
In the T.I. breakin' bags down on a big scale
That's my trap phone (beep) goin' off like a bell
Buy a new car for a new car smell
Back to back we speed racing, we'll leave 12

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
You know I'm smoking no more gas than 3 shells
DEA know to get me, they gotta have the proof like D12
When them bitches Uber arrive, I send em' out like emails
You can have all the money, it don't cost nothin' to be real
A band for these motherfuckin' flip flops
The way the choppa get to beatin' he reinventing hip hop
Man these niggas two facing, man these niggas flip flop
And my hoe say I be mean when I be off that drip drop
Aye I'm in a hot car and I got on a tank top
Ready to leave a cop car, get away like "thank God"
Came in this world vlone, man I feel like Asap
Ballin' like the Sixers, man I feel like A.I

[Hook: Ballout]
She callin' me poppa cause I carry big bills
Engine a V12 it won't even sit still
New rolley white diamonds I bought it off fish scale
Ballout baby you can call me "fish tail"
In the T.I. breakin' bags down on a big scale
That's my trap phone (beep) goin' off like a bell
Buy a new car for a new car smell
Back to back we speed racing, we'll leave 12

Sosa on the beat bitch!
