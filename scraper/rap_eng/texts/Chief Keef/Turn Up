Turn up, I turn up
I smoke loud get burnt up, ain't ma fault im burnt up
You get shot you run up, I have no competition
I be turnt up, an im fuckin all the bitches I be turnt up
Pills I pop kush I smoke bitch I feel like floatin
Gucci belt showin its O an da no end
Dont care bout no bitches, on ma road to riches
If you owe me money, better pay me back with intress
I love hittin malls up, hell yea we ball what
Never give a bitch none savage what you call us
Im turnt up we turnt up we burnt hush we turnt up
You hear sosa turn up get money turn up
