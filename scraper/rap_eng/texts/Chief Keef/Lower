[Verse 1: Ballout]
From Starter jackets to Gucci, From Air Force 1's to Louie
My [?] icy like Boosie, Bitches throwing me coochie
Riding round' with my shooters, Robin Jeans, I'm Buddah
Pouring lean I'm blue though, 9-11 the two door
Fire red like Rudolf, Imma' wrap this hoe blue though
Moving more than U Haul, You ain't real if you talk
That's why they call me Ball, Cause' all I know is Boss
Stacking hundreds' in the wall, Spent a hundred at the mall
Paid a hundred for the car, Look like a walking lick, but I'm a walking dog
Nigga I'll box you off

[Refrain: Ballout]
I ain't Young Jeezy I ain't swapping shit out
Pull the sticks out, hollows hit scalps

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I could show you the real definition of Lean, definition of Scheming
Pull up choppa waving out the back window, leave a nigga with dreams
I could show the define of spending G's, the very least
All the bad bitches up in the strip club, Subtract this cheese
I got bands so I just spent 10 thousand on a coat
And the feds asking questions but I don't really know
I just wanna count pay checks and smoke this dope
Even though I real high, my choppa real low

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
In the Louie store, getting sized ; Foreign car, getting high
Bakery, getting pie; Look up, I'm in the sky
Off the two, energized; Big shells, get minimized
Weight the steel, exercise; She suck me now I'm paralyzed
Counting racks in bed, I'm finna' get a sled
Got a bam bam in the car, Finna' turn a nigga Fred
Take your name up off the lease, hit that bitch with a shred
Like eeny meeny miney mo, click clack cause Simon said
Heads down, thumbs up; Time to play 7-UP
Lil Folks got a 7 tucked; Don't arrest the messenger
Riding with that Duck Duck Goose, It's musical chairs in this top notch Coupe, no scoop

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I could show you the real definition of Lean, definition of Scheming
Pull up choppa waving out the back window, leave a nigga with dreams
I could show the define of spending G's, the very least
All the bad bitches up in the strip club, Subtract this cheese
I got bands so I just spent 10 thousand on a coat
And the feds asking questions but I don't really know
I just wanna count pay checks and smoke this dope
Even though I real high, my choppa real low
