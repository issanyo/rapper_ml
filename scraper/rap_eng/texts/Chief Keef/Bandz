[Hook: Chief Keef]
I got bands (x33)

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Sosa Ben Franklin
You know I got them bands
Cruising in my ‘Rari me and my shooter Tray Savage
Smoking on this popeye, this shit’s some strong cabbage
And we let them shots fire [?]
Got rich, all my old hoes say they don't love me no more
Cause I be busy stunting hard and touring fucking these hoes
I got signed all my old homies started acting like hoes
But I just bought a crate of guns ‘cause I can’t trust a soul
I’m winning, I’m winning
I be at the finish line, you started where I finished
Plenty Glock 40s, get semi’d
Boy don’t get your ass smoked, boy don’t start what you can’t finish

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Verse 2: Tray Savage]
I’m getting bands, that money longer than train smoke
I’m spending cash and these bitches they know my lingo
Tray Savage get that cash I act a asshole
Pull up in that foreign act a asshole
I’m chasing bands no I can’t wife a bitch just play your role
And these niggas I can’t trust them, I just fuck they hoes
Buy a zip of earth I smoke until my eyes closed
That’s your bitch, she fucked the team now that bitch on the road
Pull up on you while you talking all that tough shit
Have my shawty run up on him on that tough shit
Noodle knocker on that brain dead band shit
I be cashing, yeah I’m rolling ‘cause you know I get it
