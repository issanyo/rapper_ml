[Verse: Chief Keef]
Bitch, don't even want you no more, fuck that shit
Every nigga toting around me, he better bust that bitch
Heard y'all niggas flav, what's up with that shit?
He gon' get you played up, get your paper up, but don't cuff that bitch
My squad, we'll fuck that bitch
She ain't even know I'm the CEO, that dumb ass bitch
Forty thousand in Moncler, yeah, I run that bitch
And I run with O'Block but yo' block, I'm on that bitch
Imma stuntin' ass nigga
Hood nigga, love money, I throw bands, look up for that shit
She spilled some liquor on my Louie, I'm off that bitch
Then I took that bitch virginity, I got some top and I fucked that bitch
