[Hook]
Like O-Dawg, I show y'all
Click clack, one roll call
Smoke tooka with my roll dogs
No bitches allowed
They only want glory, I only want top
He's a opp saying fuck me
Come through, he ducking
Shootin' out vans or truck me
If I miss he lucky, fuck nigga disgust me
Shoulda been getting that money
Now it's ugly, pistol bubbly
Shoulda kept yo damn mouth closed, you lil dummy
Pull up niggas runnin', lil bitch

[Verse 1]
I want breakfast bitch, don't lunch me
Remember posted up on Front Street
I was toting dumb heat
Boy don't get in front of me
Boy you will be done to me, cooked meat
Boy you could be under heat
Leave you where you standing on that concrete
Where I come from a jungle
Smokin' on dope, no fu
Nigga I ain't mad at you, nigga I ain't mad at yo crew
All y'all do is get money
I ain't even worried about you
You don't need to worry about me
All you need to worry about is you

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rollin' real fast in the coupe
I got alot of cash with me too
And I got my louie bag with me too
And it got cash in it too
And I got my rocket in my pocket
Pull that bitch out and pop it
When I see a motherfuckin' opp
Spot him, drop him, got him
Smokin' on tooka with the crew
Finna take a trip to the zoo
Niggas sneak diss out the blue
What the fuck is wrong with you
Pull yo skirt down, B
For we let off a hundred rounds, B
Pull yo shirt down, B
Cuz I see you ain't got none heat
I was in the county
Niggas thought they was gone clown me
That ain't going down, B
Fuck from around me
I made it from the ground, B
Still eat ground beef
Niggas act like I wasn't down here
Bitch, I was all around here
