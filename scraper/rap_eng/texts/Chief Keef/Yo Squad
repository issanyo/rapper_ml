Get my money like a doctor, I gotta get it up

Want me to blow something? Nigga let me know something
Chopper let me hold something
And I'm trying to fold something
Got my mans looking out just incase the po' coming
See, these hoes say I'm slow but they go so dumb
Got a big booty bitch screaming "Oblock"
When I'm in [?] park be screaming "Sosa"
See a bitch at the park screaming "Sosa"
