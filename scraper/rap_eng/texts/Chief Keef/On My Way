? commas for a show
Put it in the water let it float
It's icy like the fuckin' North Pole
Don't need no stoppin' might as well
Baby I got the fuckin' pack
And I got the motherfuckin' sack
It's alot of snakes in the grass
I buy anything I want
Anything I want and any more
I ain't never been to Mexico
But I'm smokin' on Texico
Remember peelin' out in 4-4s
