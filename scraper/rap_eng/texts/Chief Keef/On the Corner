[Intro: TwinCityCEO]
Damn Sosa
No one smokes weed out here on the-
On the corner, no one smokes it like you man!
You smoke trees all day? These mother fuckers donâ€™t know what they're doing

[Hook: Chief Keef]
No one on the corner got swag like us, like us
No one on the corner swag like us
No one on the corner tote, fucking traps like us
No one on the corner gonna get a bag like us
No one on the corner tote jocks like me
No one on the corner let it pop like me
No one on the corner
I swear no one on the corner

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
No one on the corner tote a strap like Sosa
No one on the corner let it clap like Sosa
No one on the corner make it happen like Sosa
No one on the corner is da captin' like Sosa
Ridin' and the hoes act up hyped though
Wherever Benji go, thats where I glo
Seen too many hoes, get too many hoes
No one on the corner got it like Sosa
Flexin on these niggas bet they like Sosa
Smokin Ganja nigga never light hoes
I'm a handy man I let the pipe go
If you scared nigga read a bible

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
No one on the corner get money like Sosa
No one on the corner got them hundreds like Sosa
No one on the corner rock shows like Sosa
No one on the corner rock hoes like Sosa
Like Sosa, like Sosa, these bitches love Sosa
If you're fine, you get closer and closer
These niggas hate Sosa
Its okay, I'm a put them thangs on ya!
Gas and then you're the first to flame on ya
Volcano your ass, King Kong ya
The choppa come through red flame on ya
Who got some money on the corner?
