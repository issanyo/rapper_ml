[Hook]
She make me feel like I got lucky, I got lucky, I got lucky
But she really only fuck me for my money, fuck me for money, fuck me for my money
Every nigga know, that lil monkey, that lil monkey, that lil monkey
I'ma CEO, baby, these niggas flunkies, these niggas flunkies, these niggas flunkies

[Verse 1]
Girl, you want some money, aye
Some money for your monkey
Girl, you lucky that you fucked me, you lucky
I'm smokin' skunky
I don't smoke duckies, I'm not a honky
Smokin' out the pound
You don't wanna fuck, bitch, watch ya mouth
'Fore you gotta get out
Get the fuck up out me house now, wow
You smoke mow mow
I'm coughing up this dope like ow ow
Baby, I see pounds of clouds
Pull up to the spot like where's my money, where's my money, where's my money
'Cause you know it was a hard life for me, hard life for me, hard life for me, guess I got lucky
