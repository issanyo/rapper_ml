[Intro: Chief Keef]
Sosa baby you know how I'm rockin' baby
Like cut off stockins'  baby keep kush in my pocket baby
All designer get your grind up
Got a Breitling for the time up
Big boss Fredo you know how I'm rockin' squad shit

[Hook: Chief Keef & Fredo Santana]
Baby girl you know I got the heat
Baby girl you know I got the G's
Baby girl you know I live that life
Baby girl you know I got that ice
Walked in this bitch
Smellin' like a pound
God damn gas so loud
Hunnid round choppa

Bang bang bang couple bodies on the ground

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Pull up on you smokin'
18 wheel rollin'
It's a problem, smoke 'em
We ain't gotta choke 'em
I don't need no holster
It's on my hip and I'ma blow it
What you bang, where you hang

Menace to society I'm Caine
Pull up in that thang that bitch stain

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
Savage Squad, Glo Gang
Killa a nigga watch 'em die dang
We don't give a fuck, we insane
Skurt-skurt pull up in that range
Bullets goin' crazy, Wu-Tang

Tell he whipped Japanese bitches eatin' sushi
Suck me so good damn, think they's my new boo thang

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Pull up in a trucks

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Nigga ain't no foldin' up

Trickin' ain't nothing if you got it and I am rich as fuck

[Hook]
