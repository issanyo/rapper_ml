[Hook: Chief Keef]
Chief Sosa love smoking on loud
I'm in my Rari smoking on loud
I hit shawty she screaming loud
She loud she loud she loud
My boys tote desert eagle they loud
So boy you best watch your mouth
Got hundred shots cause we gun you down
Guns go bow go bow go bow

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I pull off on that bitch I'm so loud
And what I'm smoking on I'm so loud
Shawty know how Sosa get down
Chief Sosa gone cum in her mouth
Damn boy your pockets so so slim
Man I can't be up in that jam
Watch Chief Sosa ball break the rim
We got lots of kush make a sell
I spend all my money on clothes
Never spend my money on hoes
Man I just be stunting on hoes
On hoes on hoes on hoes

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Verse 2: Ballout]
You know me and Chief Sosa off loud
Every time we come to your town
We smoke dope bitch and we smoke off that pound
We got choppers and I swear they so loud
Sneak diss us and we come to your town
Pull up in a 'Rari so loud
All the bad bitches be going wow
Every time we come around
They be like Ballout and Sosa so wild
Is it cause we smoke so much loud
We at the top bitch and we ain't coming down
Ballout Ballout Ballout
