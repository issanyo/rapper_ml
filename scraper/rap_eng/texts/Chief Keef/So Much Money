You’ve got 30 fucking problems if you think ’bout robbing me
I got get-a-nigga-whacked money, and they’ll go overseas
Cops pull me over they like, jeez
‘Cause I’ve got so much money on me
And I’ve got a QP with me
That’s why I’ve got so much bond money on me
And I’ve got this nina with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
So much molly, I done took so much molly
I can’t even feel my body
So much molly, I can’t feel my body
This party ’bout to turn into an orgy
See in here, it’s just one me
I’m leanin’, drank so much Codeine
Promethazine, think I’m ’bout to OD
I think I need to smoke some weed ’cause I’m really geekin’
It’s Tuesday, I’m freakin’, but we listenin’ to The Weeknd
I’m tryna mix this Vietnamese with this Puerto Rican
This fine Cali bitch’ll let me sneak this Georgia peach in
“Good grief, I can’t breathe, can we take a break?”
She’ll suck your dick through your briefs, eat beef like a steak
She put my dick on a plate, then she said her grace
She said that money make her cum, she love the way I’m paid
