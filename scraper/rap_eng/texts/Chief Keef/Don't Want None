[Intro]
Aye gang bang
Gang bang gang

[Hook]
You don't want none, nigga you don't want none (2x)
You don't want none, you don't want none
You don't want none, nigga you don't want none
You don't want none, bitch you don't want none (2x)
You don't want none, you don't want none
You don't want none, bitch you don't want none

[Verse 1]
I'm off the dope right now I'm fucked up
Nigga caught me slippin' then he lucked up
Nigga caught me slippin' then I buck buck
Macaroni time like a Kraft box
Bitch told me that she wanna let me fuck her
Told her if she let me fuck then I won't have her stuck stuck
But she gotta have some hair just like Repunzel
If she ain't got none then I don't want none
Pull up on you with my truck beatin' like a tumtum
I pull up on you smoking loud, he sound like a dumb dumb
The shit I smoke have you stuck, I swear you don't want none
I got a hollow .45, I know you don't want one

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
If you smoking reggie, I don't want none
If you drinking Quali, I don't want none
I shot from the shotty, yeah you don't want one
My gun and yo gun can have a one-on-one
She think I love her, she must think she is some money
I was in love when I first got with the money
You say you don't want none then I say you trippin' homie
Then you say you want some, I'ma send ya gift bag homie
That bitch right there on the corner waitin' on Chief Keef to speak
Waitin' on that shit, you gone be waitin' a whole year and a week
Tryna marry me, bitch'll be better waitin' on til you 53
Niggas tryna bury me, they'll be better off waitin' till they 63

[Hook]
