[Intro: Yae Yae Jordan]
Cheeks, got your mag on you?
Hold on, let me go grab mine
Sosa, got your mag on you?
I know you do, let's go

[Hook: Yae Yae Jordan]
Strapped, so I'm acting like a a-hole
Nigga, I'm acting like a a-hole
Strapped, so I'm acting like a a-hole
Nigga, I'm acting like a a-hole
Strapped
Strapped

[Verse: Chief Keef]
I'm smoking Tooka, so I'm looking like a Asian
You wake up turn yo Swag on, I wake up and turn my K on
I'm ruthless, naw baby I ain't babe naw
Niggas want  gun play but shooting down the playground
Move it
I say bitch we on that fuu shit, who this?
I say nigga we ain't cool, bitch
Me being a professional, break in your crib with a tooth pick, no new shit
I just bought a house, with a pool shit
Fuu shit
I'm on that "Go get your bitch, get groovy" I bruise it
Beat that pussy up, and abuse it
Nigga owe me money, up his ass goes the pool stick, we do's this
We got movie clips, and news clips
Top off the truck fuck all that Panoramic roof shit
My mood shit, I just go by what my fucking mood is
Mind steady telling me to kill them, then I do it
My gun should've told me something, but I can't acuse it
My mind I lose it, that's why I'm always smoking tooka
Your mind I shoot it, that's why I always hold my Ruger
I'm off a flat, fuck all that leaning with the toolie
I'm out West cooling, out West booling
Call Lil Yae Yae, pistols automatic shooting
That chopper make 'em nae nae, it's an automatic movement
My auto starting car, with my automatic toolie
Nigga pull up on me, it's a automatic shooting
Strapped

[Hook: Yae Yae Jordan]
Strapped, so I'm acting like a a-hole
Nigga, I'm acting like a a-hole
Strapped, so I'm acting like a a-hole
Nigga, I'm acting like a a-hole
Strapped
