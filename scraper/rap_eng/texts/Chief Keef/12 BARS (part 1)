[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Goddamn my swag O.D
No seeds in my weed
30 clip in my waist
Bullets spraying like sheen
I'm hitting shit low-key
Like my nigga Odee
RIP Odee, that was the bro-skey
I'm living life fast
Can't give a nigga no pass
And bitch trained to go, so on sight I'm gon' blast
Kush got me chokin'
Let's toast if you blowin'
Let's smoke if you hittin'
Let's roll if you rollin'
Sosa blowing, he ain't goin'
It's killing season for these fuck niggas when I get to blowin'
Smoke on the low end
And I ain't with the romance
You gotta do the team, for 300 she go in
