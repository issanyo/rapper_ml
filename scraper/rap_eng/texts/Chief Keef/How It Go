[Chorus]
You know how it go, baby you know how it go
I'm doing shows on the road
Getting dough girl you know how it go
Fucking hoes girl you know how it go
Counting rolls girl you know how it go
I got my pole girl you know how it go
I can't trust a soul girl you know how it go

[Verse 1]
I be counting stacks smoking Thrax on the road
After she give me neck break the back on ya ho
I ain't with that cappin' put a cap in yo skull
I know it's usually Tray Savage but I got this Mac to your skull
Give my .30 to Tadoe
Bullets fly like birdies so lay low
Like Friends niggas actin' so it's me and bankroll
I am pistol packing and I know, they don't need to say so
Smoking loud pack for my problems
But I got a mac that a solve them
I tote .30's no revolvers
Aim at ya medulla like, "Now what?"
Kush got me brain damaged smoking all this sour
And I got my cowboys, for all these cowards
He say he a clout boy? then fuck it cloud them
Fucking with my racks boy, buck shots gon' find him
He say he a clout boy then fucking cloud them
Fucking with my racks boy buck shots gon' find him

[Chorus]
You know how it go, baby you know how it go
I'm doing shows on the road
Getting dough girl you know how it go
Fucking hoes girl you know how it go
Counting rolls girl you know how it go
I got my pole girl you know how it go
I can't trust a soul girl you know how it go

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I ain't with the actin' but I got (ex)tended clips
Flexing like you bout it but your chest can get ripped
He think he Titanic put a gat to your ship
Pistol got me vibrating fuck a nigga in here
Only thing I know I ain't scared lions or big bears
Only thing I know better stop worrying bout mine and get theirs
But that's how it go when you at the top looking at the
Bottom of the world like, "Damn I used to be there"
I ain't with that opp shit or that cop shit
But I am with Glo Gang we get the gwap quick
All these niggas up in they feelings
Smoking loud pack I can't hear my feelings
All a nigga want is some billions
But I'm smoking loud pack while I spend my millions
No MC Hammer bitch I'm Sosa Jigga
No I don't know nothing no I didn't did it
No MC Hammer bitch I'm Sosa Jigga
No I don't know nothing no I didn't did it
