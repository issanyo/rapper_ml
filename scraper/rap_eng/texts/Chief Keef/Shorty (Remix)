[Hook]
They my shorties, they my shorties
They my shorties, they my shorties
I get my shorties 40's
They come throught blowin' blowin' blowin'
They ain't missin'
They come through scorin' scorin' scorin'
They my shorties, they my shorties
These niggas shorties, these niggas shorties
I get my shorties 40's
They come throught blowin' blowin' blowin'
When we pull up, hop out
Now we blowin' blowin' blowin'

[Verse: 1]
Gambino grab the strap
Flash grab my racks
Ball drive the car
Tadoe grab the thots
Tray Savage grab the Mac
Cap grab the bag
Throw bag, grab a [?]
This ain't what you want
They my shorties
Yeah we love shooting guns
Caught Caper from the front
He came through with a pump
Call up Juice from Savage Squad
He came through with that [?]
Caught Fredo out the cut
He came through with the mops
Very scary, goosebumps
I come through with the skunk
Blowin' on the skunks
Skunk reeking on my truck
And I don't give a fuck
I got money now no luck
I ain't never gave no fuck
Was always with the Buck-Buck

[Hook]
They my shorties, they my shorties
They my shorties, they my shorties
I get my shorties 40's
They come throught blowin' blowin' blowin'
They ain't missin'
They come through scorin' scorin' scorin'
They my shorties, they my shorties
These niggas shorties, these niggas shorties
I get my shorties 40's
They come throught blowin' blowin' blowin'
When we pull up, hop out
Now we blowin' blowin' blowin'

[Bridge]
They come throught blowin' blowin' blowin'
When we pull up, hop out
Now we blowin' blowin' blowin'

[Verse: 2]
Johny bitch, on my necklace
Come through with that cabbage
We no drama, young and reckless
My niggas always wilding
I swear they off protected
We don't know no detectives
We don't   know who shoots the weapons
Don't care 'bout Lexa
All I care about is money
Don't give no fuck 'bout court
Don't give no fuck 'bout Ronnie
I'm so accounted with money
It's more money than tsunami
I'm so [?] With my shorties we be [?]

[Hook]
They my shorties, they my shorties
They my shorties, they my shorties
I get my shorties 40's
They come throught blowin' blowin' blowin'
They ain't missin'
They come through scorin' scorin' scorin'
They my shorties, they my shorties
These niggas shorties, these niggas shorties
I get my shorties 40's
They come throught blowin' blowin' blowin'
When we pull up, hop out
Now we blowin' blowin' blowin'

[Outro] x4
They my shorties, they my shorties
