[Intro: Chief Keef]
You know how I'm rockin
Cut off stockings
Keep kush in my pocket
All designer
Get your grind up
Got a breitling for the mothafuckin timer

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I'll never leave the house without my burner man
Without a pack of swishers and some marijuana
I'll never leave the house without my gat
I'll never leave the house without my thumper
I'll never leave the house without my pack
I'll never leave the house without my strap
I'll never leave your bitch up in my house
And I a'll never leave that shit up in my house

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I'll never leave the house without my thing
Nigga say you want problems, nigga swing
I'll never leave the house without my loud
I'll never leave the house without my bling
I'll never leave the house without my hollows
Boink a nigga, give his ass funky feet
I'll never leave my house where the motto
I don't give a fuck if she was fine as cream
Come from broken playgrounds
Now I like, valley swings
Pistols still be like congos and tambourines
Off the thoinks jump around like pogos and trampolines
I'll never leave my house without my weed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Andy Milonakis]
I'm a midnight runner cause come on I lean
This sippin' got me limpin' I should call it Hi-C
I got sicker whips than Indiana
And these thots ride with me like country grammar
Sosa comin' through and he glo'n like a black light
Fredo in the cut, just in case ya'll don't act right
Stackin' more bricks than an Eskimo, just to let em' know
And I sext yo ho, that bitch pussy open like the letter o
Imma let her go, never wed a ho, only wet a ho
Imma high school drop out, wit a couple millie
Knockers in my pockets, be just so silly
Tryna cop an island in twenty-sixteen
And then i'll fill the ocean up with henny and lean (bitch)

[Hook]
