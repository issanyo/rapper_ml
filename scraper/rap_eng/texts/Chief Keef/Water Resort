[Chorus]
Woke up, brush my teeth
Thank the lord that I'm here today
Stole Toyota's, now I hop out the 'cat, hop in a Wraith
I'm a fuckin king, where's my throne?
Bring a young nigga some grapes
This bitch talk too much, oh my god
Bring a young nigga some tape
Just cuz I got cash don't mean I won't smoke your ass like a Newport shorty
I guess I gotta learn, it's just just some shit that I can't do no more
Don't come when not ready, it's a young nigga
Tell ya crew to abort
Hop in that wet wet shorty, somethin' like a water resort

[Verse 1]
With a bitch named Arissa
Going faster than a missile
Too blunts with a tissue
Girl shooting at me like a pistol (Bang)
Hit a bitch with a whistle
What's on my feet? They Balenci's
I got a dirty mouth need to rinse it
I need all the bread and the biscuits
Slippers came with shoestrings
Timbs still got a shoestring
Three flexed up too clean
Twenty thousand and I bought two things
Sent granny n' momma a 50
Bitch want me to sign her titties
I need you to mind your business
Where the cash at? Go get it
Where the bitches at? Go fuck em
Where the opps at? Don't duck em
The law hate me so fuck em
These niggas fake don't hug em
Sosa bipolar, don't bug him
You already know he don't trust em
The nigga too cool, get a oven
He one egg short from a dozen

[Chorus]
Woke up, brush my teeth
Thank the lord that I'm here today
Stole Toyota's, now I hop out the 'cat, hop in a Wraith
I'm a fuckin king, where's my throne?
Bring a young nigga some grapes
This bitch talk too much, oh my god
Bring a young nigga some tape
Just cuz I got cash don't mean I won't smoke your ass like a Newport shorty
I guess I gotta learn, and this is just some shit that I can't do no more
Don't come when not ready, it's a young nigga
Tell ya crew to abort
Hop in that wet wet shorty, somethin' like a water resort

[Verse 2]
You ain't smokin by the ounce, you can bounce
I don't smoke no mid, I smoke super loud
Damn near quit the lean see if I can do without it
On illustrator makin' me a new medallion
Be careful this package is super fragile
And my dog keep eating my Gucci sandals
Hoe see me in person like "ooh he handsome"
Tryna stuff this cash in my Gucci pants
Man these niggas be having me fucked up
When the boss talking shut the fuck up
Some of these hoes say I act stuck up
Know it's fuck you if it's fuck us
Chief Sosa how come you don't trust us?
Wish Chance's light came down and struck us
Need to learn how to take down your instructions
Gotta have Ben Frank grand jack all in structure
My dog fresher than you
My daughter is too
My heat get to stuttering
Get barbecue-cue'd
My heat get to stuttering
Duh duh da doo doo
Foes at my door like doo doo
They know I'm gorilla like mmm mmm

[Chorus]
Woke up, brush my teeth
Thank the lord that I'm here today
Stole Toyota's, now I hop out the 'cat, hop in a Wraith
I'm a fuckin king, where's my throne?
Bring a young nigga some grapes
This bitch talk too much, oh my god
Bring a young nigga some tape
Just cuz I got cash don't mean I won't smoke your ass like a Newport shorty
I guess I gotta learn, and this is just some shit that I can't do no more
Don't come when not ready, it's a young nigga
Tell ya crew to abort
Hop in that wet wet shorty, somethin' like a water resort
