Forgiatos came on a sprinter van, do the race

Still take the mollys, jaws lock like a diamond in a safe

Big SSET, whip it out the ball, uh, uh, uh (cook up, cook up, cook up)
Lil mama soaked with lip gloss, uh, uh (fuck nigga)
Big thick bitch on the pole, uh, uh
Told that bitch to stop playin', come closer (yadigg?)
I'ma put my finger in her, test the water (eh)
Got pH balance, pounds half, tight rubber (yuh, yuh)
Ate her out on Christmas, my teeth colder than my shoulder (tuh)
