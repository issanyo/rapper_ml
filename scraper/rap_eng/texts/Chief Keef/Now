Aye x3
Aye x13

(Hook)
I been toting poles
Since a runny nose
Got a big choppa
Come shoot up you honey comb
(Hide out) Aye
We gone find out where you ride out
Shoot yo block upside down (inside out)
We gone get in and out im penny proud
Cuz im gettin pennies now
I make money fly like pigeons now
Where dat money, im gone get it now

(Verse 1)
Now
Need to buy some shit now
Niggas need to buy my bitch now
Cuz she getting on my shit now
My nerves.... Thats my word
Finna swerve bitch im so absurd
Say you smoking purp
You is smoking dirt
Im smokin private reserve
You thought i was smoking earth
You niggas from the burbs
Pull up on da curb
Let my pistol squirt
Leave a nigga hurt
You prolly sneak dissin now
Boy pull down your skirt
My niggas with me now
They put down to the work

(Hook)
