I gotta get my racks up (my racks up), I gotta get my back rubbed (my back rubbed)
I need to get my hoes up (my hoes up), I need to get my rolls up (my rolls up)
Gotta get in a hot tub (hot tub), with 'bout 5 thots (5 thots)
And 'bout 5 women (5 women), with 'bout 5 guns (5 guns)
Gotta get it no matter what (no matter what), gotta make my mind up (my mind up)
Gotta make my mama proud (my mom proud), that's who get my love (get my love)
Gotta put it in the Swisher, 5 dubs (5 dubs)
Gotta glo on these niggas, light bulbs (light bulbs)
You got your time (your time), it can be time up

[Verse 1]
You ain't fuckin' on yo bitch, I was
You ain't countin' on a million, I done
Smoking dope with this (?)
Gotta a thot sellin' dope and I told the cops I was
Cause I don't give no fuck, aye
This Breitling I got cost 33 puffs (33 puffs, aye)
This life that I got cost 33 nuts (33 nuts, aye)
This chain that I got cost me fucking 20 (20)
And I'm only 18 with this money
I spend it, make it back, aye
She top me, I break her back, aye
Live life like a model, so I bring that sack, aye
Give KayKay twenty thousand dollars every time she cry, aye

[Verse 2]

Light it up, light it up, light it up, then ash that shit (ass that shit)
All these bitches on my dick cause, I get a lil pass and shit (pass and shit)
When I ain't had nothing, where they ass had went, aye

But they time's up, I fuck 'em then fire 'em (fire 'em)
And she thought she was getting a chance, she was flying down

Thinkin' 'bout Ben Franklin
But he in a better place and that's my pocket
