[Hook]
Taxing all these niggas, Uncle Sam
My forty fell down my pants, pardon him

[Verse 2]
Shoes on my feet, I don't know what the fuck they call em
But I know how much the fuck they cost
They cost fifteen hundred dollars
Remeber when I couldn't get a dollar
I had to make a fuck nigga holla
Pistol to his fucking skull and daughter
Put this pistol to his fucking mother
Told his mama "your son got my cheddar"
I don't wanna have to use my Beretta
My Beretta go through your damn leather
Boy, you better have a teflon
Taxing all these niggas, Uncle Sam
Sosa, Sammy Sosa, I be him
I hit a homerun after party with him
Come through shooting up your party and dem
Catch you in the lobby, you get lobby left
I don't give a fuck, bitch I am a fe-lo-ny
Now this felony get cheese
This felony got bitches on they knees, making them bleed
Counting this cheese, counting them G's, nigga
I don't fuck with police, nigga
Up this mothafucka, I'm like "freeze nigga, freeze nigga"

[Hook]
