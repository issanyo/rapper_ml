[Intro]
Go and grab the K
Spray it in his face
In the fuckin' way

[Hook]
Who is this fuck nigga, go and grab the K
Lock and load that mothafucka, spray it in his face
You're just an obstacle in the fuckin' way
I ain't like yo fucking ass any fuckin' way
Did what they said I couldn't, done what they said I wouldn't
Went where they said I can't, and that's the fucking bank!
Smokin' on this fuckin' stink and I know it fuckin' stink
Niggas snakes, bitches snakes, money ain't, money can't

[Verse 1]
Nigga what yo money funny
You ain't runnin' round, here money hungry
Smokin' on that skunky skunky
I'm ridin' wit my homies homies, I'm high I'm on Mars
Remember being locked up behind bars, now I got dem bars
Hit you in ya heart wit this fuckin' gun, my gun look like Big Pun
And these shells look like Big Glo's teeth
Up this bitch it's a big ol heat

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This fuck nigga I don't even know him
Where the fuck he come from
I was somewhere ridin' round wit guns
I was somewhere ridin' round wit drugs
All the street niggas show me love
All the thots wanna gimme hugs
These bitches know that Sosa ain't no scrub
I up this fuckin' chopper and I bust
I'm success, you lil niggas sus
Suspect, you lil niggas knew it
I get dumb checks, you lil niggas funny
Do a walk up, you lil niggas runnin'

[Hook]
