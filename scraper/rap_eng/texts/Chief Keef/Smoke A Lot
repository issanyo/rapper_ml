[Verse 1]
Thirty clip on my hip
Talk shit it's slappin'
D-I-S fucking Glock
And get to clappin'
Cuz I'm rollin' off a pill
Bitch I'm triple stackin'
All I need is six guns
And I'm pistol packin'
Smokin' loud
This shit is gross
This shit is gross
This bitch hit it
She did the most
She did the most
These bitches know I like to show
T.U.O I'm with the folks
We off the shits, we off the smokes
Like some slaves, I'm in the field
Totin' steel
We're sick, we drill for real
So don't get killed
It's only right
We hit a stain, we smokin' all night
Bitch I go hard, everyday in the dark
Must come to the light

[Chorus x2]
Bitch I'm smokin' a lot of clips
This shit is gross
Off a pill, I like to roll
Let's get a 4 in a Sprite
I'm up all night like 24
I like to roll x3

[Verse 2]
I like to roll, bitch you won't
24 Fredo Santana and Reesey Money
Go clap them poles
You know we leaning like kickstands
Cuz we off a 4
We all hit, we drill your bitch
I bet she go I-N every the time
All the bitches do 300 Glory B-O-Y's
All the bitches know me
When we step up on the scene
And get to fading
Turning blood into some art
And get to painting
Pop a pill, this shit is real
How I feel, don't get killed
Like [?]
We [?]
She on my dick x3
My eyes the color of fucking piss
Of fucking piss

[Chorus]
