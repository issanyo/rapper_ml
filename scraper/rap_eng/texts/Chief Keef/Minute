I like, I like, I like, I like hunnits
On my, mother-fuckin' mind is money (Ghost)
Riding Rolls Royce lookin' like some money
Master P ridin' with that unh in a Hummer / Oh no
Know these niggas wanna be petty
Make-up, these bitches wanna be pretty
Ri-der, make her put the heater in her panties
Got bands, pussy, I'll be there in a minute

[Verse 1]
I ain't got a minute
Baby wait a minute
Before you start, you don't need to finish
Every fuckin' text, you don't need to send us
You a good girl, you don't need a menace
Ridin' in the car, lookin' at the stars
Cause I dropped the top, this been done before
I done got the cops, focused on the car
Bitch up in the passenger, focused on the watch
Walked in double G, lookin' for a fit
Step up on my kicks, I'ma have a fit
I'm ridin' in a Porsche, lookin' like a scorch
Photo shoot on the Porsche
So much designer, I'm endorsed

I like, I like, I like, I like hunnits
On my, mother, fuckin' mind is money (Ghost)
Riding Rolls Royce lookin' like some money
Master P ridin with that unh in a Hummer / Oh no
Know these niggas wanna be petty
Makeup, these bitches wanna be pretty
Rider, make her put the heater in her panties
Got bands pussy, I'll be there in a minute

[Verse 2]
Dolla, dolla bill y'all, we play big ball
You think it's on a crate, how that bitch sit tall
Get the car waxed, and had the dirt ripped off
Boy, that shit ain't real, those some Gucci rip offs
These ain't out, these some Hermes flip flops
You thought that you saw these, you sniffin' Chris Rock
I'm in that tic-toc, and I'm making pit stops
2 4 14's, bitch we got big blocks
The dope, dope, dope keep me calm
This fuckin' chinchilla keep me warm
It's Chief So, it's Turbo, it's a bomb
I just flamed a loud pack, AKA alarm

I like, I like, I like, I like hunnits
On my, mother, fuckin' mind is money (Ghost)

Master P ridin with that unh in a Hummer / Oh no
Know these niggas wanna be petty
Makeup, these bitches wanna be pretty
Rider, make her put the heater in her panties
Got bands pussy, I'll be there in a minute
