[Hook]
I swear I'ma keep it real, tell you how I feel
Only squad I trust, for the squad I bust
You be honest, be foreal, that's how you feel
I'm touring on my tour bus smoking la la la
I don't care how you feel, that's how I feel
I'm higher than the stars and you like blah blah blah
I swear I just wanna chill, and smoke some kill
And watch my numbers just rise rise rise

[Verse 1]
For the squad I bust, for the squad she bust
I used to be broke, well not anymore
I got racks all in my drawer, I got racks all on the floor
I think that I'm shit so I blow hunnas out my nose
I throw 50s on a bitch, 650 on my kicks
Couple thousands on a shirt
For my pants 5 hundred bills, my belt 15 hundred bills
This shit down 3 hundred here
You know we throw hundred here
Strip club they love us there
Words of Ben Franklin in God I trust
And when it goes down in my squad I trust
I swear you'll never find a squad like us
A squad to shine bright in the dark like us
Because we the Glory Boyz, we just hope you know that
We full of ignorance and we a bunch of shooters
Because we the Glory Boyz, we just hope you know that
We full of ignorance and we a bunch of shooters
