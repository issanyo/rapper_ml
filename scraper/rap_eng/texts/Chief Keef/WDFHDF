What da fuck, how da fuck did you let your friends come
In between us and what we’ve done
How da fuck, what da fuck your thot thought this shit was
Nigga dream on, get you big money
How da fuck, what da fuck, Sosa got that good stuff
Since I smoked that good pack, I won't look back
What da fuck, how da fuck you fit those subs on yo trunk
Baby I got the tool in it, bitch I'm the mechanic

[Verse 1]
I'm the mechanic, one eyed bandit
Fix this shit with all mah linens
I ain't got my diamonds dirty now I got to go and clean them
Pulled up, bitch what's happening
Bitch, she's down to hop in traffic
Walk up in the stores, I'm cashin'
Then I'm walking the fuck up out it
Niggas faggots, bitches maggots
Riding fast, thought it was tragic
Love Ben Franklins, thought it was magic
Uncle Sammy, bitch I'm taxin'
Bling bling, racks in mah jeans
Bling bling, look at mah ring
Bling bling, look at mah chain
Ring ring with my ring
Smoke K.I, smoke Tooka, K.I was a shooter
And I'm Almighty but I got on fuckin' Buddhas
300 for these Trueys
500 for the new ones
I riding with my boo thang
Finna pick up my new thang

What da fuck, how da fuck did you let your friends come
In between us and what we’ve done
How da fuck, what da fuck your thot thought this shit was

How da fuck, what da fuck, Sosa got that good stuff
Since I smoked that good pack, I won't look back
What da fuck, how da fuck you fit those subs on yo trunk
Baby I got the tool in it, bitch I'm the mechanic

[Verse 2]
Had to paint my car red, fire red
Pull a hoe like aw shit
Talk shit, niggas like to talk shit
Cause they walkin', aw shit
Pull up on them bitches like aw shit
This dope got me coughin'
Thought I was going up in a coffin
Aw shit, what them niggas say when we pull up sparkin'
We ain't parkin'
Got a bad ass bitch riding for me
