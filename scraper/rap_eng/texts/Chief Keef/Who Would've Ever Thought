[Hook: Future]
Who would've ever thought that I would grind like this
Who would've ever thought that diamonds cost this much
Who would've ever thought that nigga's can't be trusted
Who would've ever thought that girl wouldn't give it up
Who would've ever thought Future wouldn't ride in foreigns
Who would've ever thought that I would never kill the chorus
Who would've ever thought that I would take the streets again
Who would've ever thought that I would never be the man

[Verse: Chief Keef]
Who would've ever thought that I would be Almighty So
Who would've ever thought I'd drive these cars
And fuck all these hoes
But I'm still the same Old Chief Sosa from the O
You disrespect the squad then itâ€™s over, vamanos
I'm leanin' off this Act, this shit got me fallin' over
Got these Robin's on my ass, all this money fallin' out
You ain't ever fuck with me these niggas think that I forgot 'em
Who would ever thought I'd hit the top from the bottom
I remember posted on the block totin' slammers
And if a opp pull up on the block, we gon' blam 'em
And if I get arrested by the cops I don't remember
And if that ho ain't tryna gimme top, I'm gon' suspend her
These niggas actin' hard but they sweet they hard vanilla
I nicknamed my Carbon 15 "Carbonella"
I'm smokin' on this Earth, you smokin mid ain't hard to tell ya

[Hook]
