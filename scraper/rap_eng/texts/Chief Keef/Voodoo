[Hook]
I'm with my crew them my loose screws
And no we don't pack no deuce deuce
Got 4 O's with bout two two
At your nose and your to to
Smoking on a big blunt of TuTu
When you snooze thats when you lose
What you do thats what you knew
How you move just like voodoo

[Verse 1:]
I ride down and I hop out
Got ambulance and the cops out
And cus my mans bought the Glocks out
Cus your mans want to talk now
I was smoking dope with the pole on my own
With them racks in my pocket, all that I know
Let a fuck nigga try me blow him and I quote
Can't come through boy without no chain adios
Glock 18 come through wrestling like who do rhino
Can't trust no thot they be done stole all my clothes
And I got my pole I like it slow watch I blow
He can act like he bout it whole time I know
You wearing Fucci, my life Gucci I get coochie
I got my .30 I'm a squeeze it at your tooty

My niggas Looney they like Louie clips like movies
I'm with my goonies and we riding spot 'em got 'em
All these niggas steady talking bout they savage
And all these bitches steady talking bout they love me
Got a millennium in the torch, they look like cousins
She gone do my chores if I fuck her
But I was always told to never trust her
Keep my pole with me and always bust 'em
Never know who will try your ass in public

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Smoking on a big ass blunt of Aiki pack doe

And I got my .40 got 50 fucking 4 0's in his stomach
Thats 50 shots up in the clip for all of those who ain't know how I'm rocking
You know how I'm rocking cut off stockins
Keep kush up in my pocket with my Glock and

Don't make me put this choppa to your bandana

[Bridge]

I'm a sin with my gun and say amen with my gun

[Verse 3:]
