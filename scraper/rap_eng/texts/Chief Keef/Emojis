[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Since that bitch like emojis, she like to text emojis
I sent her a emoji like don't call my phone please!
No I don't like Macaroni, no you can't cook it for me
That bitch make me wish I never made that song
She get the stalking trophy!
Balling hard bitch I'm Kobe
You ain't balling hard, I don't know you
Damn bitch you nosey, please don't touch my phone please
Like sending my hoes emojis
I'm too high you gone blow me
Riding around smoking OG, no I don't fuck with no G

[Hook]
Emojis, emojis, the bitch like to text emojis
Emojis, emojis, so I sent emojis
Emojis, emojis, and now we send emojis
Emojis, emojis, all she send is a emojis
