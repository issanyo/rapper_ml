[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Bang bang, bang
Bang, Sosa baby
Bang, bang
I'ma Glory B-O-A, I get chips like Frito Lay (get back)
Told y'all 'bout cracking cards, just step up your B-O-A (step up)
10 thousand dollars that's a month, cut the royalties away
Huh huh huh huh

[Hook]
I'ma Glory B-O-A, I get chips like Frito Lay (get back)
Told y'all 'bout cracking cards, just step up your B-O-A (step up)
10 thousand dollars that's a month, cut the royalties away (cut it up)
I get a lot of cheese everyday Dorito's day (Sosa baby)
I'ma Glory B-O-A, I get chips like Frito Lay (huh)
Told y'all 'bout cracking cards, just step up your B-O-A (step up)
10 thousand dollars that's a month (huh), cut the royalties away (nah)
I get a lot of cheese everyday Dorito's day

[Verse]
Got the city on fire,  got a lot of hoes on me
I done been around the world, I met all type of hoes
I swear I love all my bitches but they won't get my soul
Cause I can't trust a bitch, so I just slut all my hoes
Like bitch don't call my phone leave me lone, leave me lone
That bitch love me because I'm a pot of gold, pot of gold
And how these bitch's stuck on Sosa know, Sosa know
I'm a boss, bitch I rep three double O, don't you know
I can't trust that she might wanna fuck my mans, yeah my mans
I got hella racks and I got hella bands hella bands bands
