[Hook]
When I'm done counting money
I gotta take a fuck me break
I should take a vacation
I should take a stuntin' break
I'm always taking juice breaks
Got hit Thursday, told her don't hit me till Tuesday
Told her take a high break
Can you tell me what the sky say?

[Verse 1: Tadoe]
On instagram I got a blue check
In my pocket got them blue checks
Just flew in on a blue jet
Got a draco, I ain't blew yet
Glock 17 blew 30 times
Where da pints, i need 30 lines
Hit the stu, drop 30 grand
Lil folks got a Glock, it's a dirty nine
You could take some shots, if you run it up
I'ma get the Guap, i'ma run it up
Off the blue strips to make your boo leave
Keep the ranch sauce, i want the blue cheese

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Phone keep on vi-vibrating
Bitch want my time, sa-save it
Niggas don't speak my la-language
Looked up at God, sa-save me
Momma told me, stay out of ja-jail
My homie 'n 'em they got nail-nailed
[?] folks nem so solid they ain't [?] they ain't tell
Just bossin' shit, them knocked the train off the rail-rail
Momma told me, look boy be care-careful
Momma told me, stand up on your legs
This bitch sta-stand up on my bed
Bitch cut em up [?]  ga-gave me head

When I'm done counting money
I gotta take a fuck me break
I should take a vacation
I should take a stuntin' break
I'm always taking jewels breaks
Got hit Thursday, told her don't hit me on Tuesday
Told her take a high break
Can you tell me what the sky say?
