[Intro]
Yeah
Thuggin' in these streets, I put the test, nigga

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't hard, they some lil' niggas (On God, bitch)
Thuggin' in these streets, I put the test, nigga (Thuggin', hah)
These niggas dissin', lil' nigga, go get your big homie (Yeah)
I might put that nigga to rest, nigga (Grah, grah)
I put codeine in my veins, I'm goin' insane (Codeine)
Tired of all these niggas actin' like they insane
If you crazy, nigga, put them FN's on you (FN's on you)
If you crazy, nigga (Yeah), we put them blue tips on you (God, nigga)

[Verse]
We rip through you like tissue (Tissue)
We catch 'em all like Pikachu (Trapnanana)
Don't link with no fuck niggas (Yeah)
That's why we called Non-Neutral (Trapnanana)
It's a lot of shots come behind this gang shit (Gang, gang)
My opps can die today or tomorrow, they still gon' be nameless (Trapnanana)
They keep on askin' why I'm rappin' 'bout this murder shit
'Cause I'm traumatized and a nigga been through some shit (On God)
On the late night, me and Puffo, we ride through some shit
They ain't out on they block, we'll come back again (Graow, graow)
Feel like I'm wastin' my time 'cause niggas ain't on shit (Graow, graow)
These niggas be gettin' disrespectful so I ain't squashin' shit
If I got it on me, I'm poppin' shit (Trapnanana)
Ain't the only one that tried to diss
I'm Sprite, these niggas Sierra Mist
Got the Glock with me, I won't never miss

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't hard, they some lil' niggas (Trapnanana)
Thuggin' in these streets, I put the test, nigga
These niggas dissin', lil' nigga, go get your big homie
I might put that nigga to rest, nigga (Bitch, Trapnanana)
I put codeine in my veins, I'm goin' insane (Codeine)
Tired of all these niggas actin' like they insane (I'm tired)
If you crazy, nigga (Boom), put them FN's on you (FN's on you)
If you crazy, nigga (What?), we put them blue tips on you
