[Intro: Capo]
I know why you niggas hate me
I know why you niggas hate me
I know why you niggas hate

[Hook: Capo x2]
I know why you niggas hate me
I see the looks behind my back boy why you hate me?
Cause I ain't do nothin' but do me
Cause I'm a glo boy
And your bitch left you, and chose me

[Verse 1: Capo]
Now I know why you niggas hate me
And I ain’t do nothing but doing me (no!)
Matter fact I know why you hate me
Cause I got up in work then you play lazy
I Gotta go and grind , bitch I gots get mine
If that boy don’t grind, then that boy don’t shine
Lot of niggas on my ear, do this, do that, can’t tell me shit!
Get back on bro n'em, ain’t trying hear that boy
Who you playing with?
Lot of niggas playing around and they ass ain't saying shit
If you hating on that man, you been waiting then
Smile in my face, boy with that shit
I been seeing you sneak dissing and me hating and shit

[Hook: Capo x2]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I’m smoking on this Kush pack
I swear last year, I ain’t had shit but how I look now
Pull a forward, take a look back
Posted on O'Block front street 300, Ain't got it I took that
I know why these niggas hate me
Cause I don’t fuck with niggas, for a verse, they gotta pay me
Why all these niggas trying do me?
Cause I’m a G L O W boy, my life a movie
Sixty grand in my Robins
These niggas ain’t talking no money
They talking that nonsense
These fuck boys know how I’m rocking
I’m Almighty so I got as much money as my confidence

[Hook: Capo x2]
