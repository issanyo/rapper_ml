[Intro]
GGP, G..G..P, GGP
My car ain't got no roof on it, yo car got a boot on it
I'm on it like blue bonnit, my weed is just so toxic
Gang, aye
*Sosa On The Beat*

[Hook]
I'm flexing hard up in this bitch no I do not know what to say
I dont really gotta say anything, I just gotta pull out my K
It's a finesse-a-thon we juggin' everything
Flash Flood warning coming through, I'm wetting everything Gang!
I'ma Lil flexer don't wear no Mason Margiela, Gotta hit up my bank teller
I'm just tweakin' like The Goodfellas, blowing this gas from the loft
When I pull up yeah they smell us

[Verse 1]
My car ain't got no roof on it, yo car got a boot on it I'm on it like blue bonnit
My weed is just so toxic, cut the crap, cut it out, in the cut Neosporin
Off a flat hear every sound laugh to the bank, flex Tracy Morgan
I'm flexing they gettin pissed, I want more, more no less my wrist froze piss
Take em' out, do the chores and take it step by step
It's time to collect... collect, collect
My blunts a collector's item, this bitch gon' do whatever I say just like I'm Simon
Simon says go out and get it, keep your eyes up on the prize Rappers falling off, they cannot climb
Yeah I'm bugging, Buzz Life is what I'm living
Almighty killed the beat, Lil Flash he took the life sentence
Out in Texas, in yo bitch mouth like a dentist (Gang, Gang, Gang)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Geeking like I'm off 10 flats, I do not pass just check my stats
Watchu smokin ain't no pack, that pack make you get a rash
Got white like Ku Klux Klan, I'm glo-ing just like it's a lamp
Want a feature from me? A band
Flexing like I'm Undertaker, Kane
If ya talking out ya brain, swisher music to ya face
All I do is flex WWF, I roll up too much gas ya I confess
Glo Gang , them my jets
And I just walked down from the jet, I'mma walking trap house yeah I'm always on deck
Remember rolling up under my school desk (Gang, HaHaHa Ha)

[Hook]
