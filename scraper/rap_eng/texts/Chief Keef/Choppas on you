[Intro]
Man I'm woke off the xans
These niggas sleep off the xans
These niggas can't take xans man
I'm on three xans man, I'm up man, turnt up man

[Hook]
I just bought a chain cause I'm glorious
She can get the thing cause she's glorious
Pull up in that thing it look gorgeous
I'm in California, plates say Florida
But i'm from Chiraq, It's no order
Coming out here it's like you trying to cross the border
You better have your weapon and your badge
We gon' put them choppas on yo' ass

[Verse 1]
Stop playin' all them games yo' lil kiddie ass
And just maintain yo' lil bitty ass
I'm humble with my choppa I'ma spit it fast
Niggas on that snake shit I don't get it man
Sold my S-R-T it cost 50 man
Check out my watch bitch it's 50 bands
Sit and watch me buy it if I fit it man
How I'm always gloing you just don't get it man
I name my pistol, pistons; Detroit, Michigan
Got some thick hoes in Detroit, Michigan
And steady blowing O's bitch, I'm Michelin
Point at your ass, shoot, ain't missing shit

[Hook]
I just bought a chain cause I'm glorious
She can get the thing cause she's glorious
Pull up in that thing, it look gorgeous
I'm in California, plates say Florida
But i'm from Chiraq, It's no order
Coming out here it's like you trying to cross the border
You better have your weapon and your badge
We'll put them choppas on yo' ass

[Verse 2]
We going to put them choppas on yo' ass
You gon' need a doctor for yo ass
You gon' need a helicopter for yo' ass
Them choppas spitting real fucking fast
And that car driving, real fucking fast
I almost crashed
Smoking this fucking dope man
And I got it from my dope man
You smoking on that ass pack, Lil nigga
I'm smoking on that gas bag, Lil nigga
And I get cash sack Lil nigga
Racks on racks on racks, racks Lil Nigga

[Hook]
I just bought a chain cause i'm glorious
She can get the thing cause she's glorious
Pull up in that thing, it look gorgeous
I'm in California, plates say Florida
But i'm from Chiraq, It's no order
Coming out here it's like you trying to cross the border
You better have your weapon and your badge
We gon put them choppas on yo' ass
