[Verse 1]
I got cash
All I need is some cigars
And a pistol
For my enemies, they friend of me
Fuck boys tryna get to me
I think they think it's Swisher Sweet
I'm rolling up a Swisher Sweet, I don't smoke dutchies
And when it comes to thots I don't love 'em

[Bridge]
I just fuck 'em, pass 'em to my dawgs, can't trust 'em
Cause they busted, discussing, they can't be trusted
All these thots act like they in love with me
My house so big, fuck a street

[Verse 2]
I think my pistol can't stand me
Told me get up off your feet
Do a drill
Do a kill
Bitch I told 'em cops how shit real
They gon' lock me up
Fuck I'll get out like before, I ain't snitching though
I just wanna go to my big ass home
Where my big ass mattress I spend them bands on
Keep declining the shit, she calling my damn phone
Niggas mad, what the hell is wrong
Cause I getting guap and you ain't getting none
You will never hit the top like me
You will never see some guap like me
I can go to sleep and wake up, guap with me
It's right by me or right across the street
In the bank

[Bridge]
I just got a car
Remember when I wasn't old enough
I still had them bands, though
How much I get signed for? 6 mill

[Verse 3]
Bitch chill
Cool like a windmill
Blowin smoke, damn this shit kill
You want gun smoke? Nigga, get killed
I know how bagging a whole brick feel
Hop off the car, don't put my windshield
Hop out the car, hoes on my damn heels
Bitch, get money or get damn killed
You can't get killed getting money bitch, hell yeah
Scared, go to church and holla redrum
And I'm still going hard, since they free'd damn guap
Still going hard 'til they free Slick
You know thats who I be with
You know that's who I tote heat with
Blow heat with
Smoke trees with
That's my brother from another mother
I say fuck them other motherfuckers
Niggas ain't loyal
But bitch I am Gloyal
Glo Gang

Your bitch know my name, you hate me
But your bitch always play me
