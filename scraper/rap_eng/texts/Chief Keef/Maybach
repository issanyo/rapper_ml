[Intro]
Yo, your mother's a ho bag
Sachi

[Verse 1: Andy Milonakis]
Young Sachi, colder than a Maybach
Got some new Versace, it cost me a Sajak
That's a fortune, Illuminati rolls
Illuminate, illuminary diamonds on my blueberries
My stoned epiphanies worth more than stones at Tiffany's
You insta hoes mean shit to me
Shake my head in disbelief
A ho is a ho, it just go like that
These racks is easy when I flow like that
I got the loud blowing O's back to back
And if you ain't me, you're wack

[Hook x3]
Young Sachi, colder than a Maybach
Colder than a Maybach

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Look up out my window, I see a pretender
He is a beginner
He shiver when its winter
My blunt just burned my finger
Gucci on my slippers
Raised down the window
Nigga why you slipping
Trapper how you flipping
Then you know I'm dippin' things
Doing money, whippin'
Hey Andy slow me up
I got nerve, I'm sipping
[?] so i got my la clippers
[?]
Doing 110 in a 55, got the cop behind me they slippin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Fredo Santana]
Hundred bands in my shoe box, I'm a young trapper
Come to Front Street if you want to see my trap spot
I remember when I was just a fucking have not
Now I got a fat knot, now I'm shooting it at you
Flexing like I'm Ken Shamrock, bitches on my damn cizock
She's sipping syrup while I'm pouring sizzurp
See this rollie on my wrist, it don't do no tick-tock
[?] is how I been when I [?]
Got this nine on my waist, it's gon' push you back
When I pull it out, I don't do a push up or a pull up

[Hook]
