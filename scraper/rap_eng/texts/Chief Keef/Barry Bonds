[Hook]
I know that these streets don't love me
I know that these bitches don't love me
I know that these niggas don't love me
Where you were when we were on front street
Phony love, these niggas filled with phony love
Gotta keep doing the shit that shorties love
I ain't got no time, hurry up
Another home run, I'm Barry Bonds

[Verse: 1]
Bitch call me daddy
Bitches older than me call me Daddy
I'm movin' on up, George Jefferson
I ain't Lil Mouse but i got hella bands
Skinny jeans but I used to wear baggy
You a scooby doo you a Shaggy
That shit you be talking - irrevelant
Been knocking at the door, bout to let 'em in
She steady talking 'bout she celibate
Still gon' fuck me because my necklace bling
And I'm counting check after check
Phone keep going off and I lettin' it ring
Nigga you fake can't cover that up
Get your clique and huddle dat up
Say she wanna ride told her back dat up
Told me slow down, told her shut that up
Take a bitch dreams and wet that up
Bro got a plan told him set that up
If you fall down nigga get back up
My ex just said she wanna kick back up

[Hook]
I know that these streets don't love me
I know that these bitches don't love me
I know that these niggas don't love me
Where you were when we were on front street
Phony love, these niggas filled with phony love
Gotta keep doing the shit that shorties love
I ain't got no time, hurry up
Another home run, I'm Barry Bonds

[Verse: 2]
The dope got me light
I was hitting a bitch she was light
Always wanted to be like Mike
Now the kids wanna be like me
But you not on my speed
We fuckin' on the B, that's Sunny D
So Chief Keef finish on your feet
'Fore you leave bitch brush your teeth
Walked in the club using my fake
No Betty Crocker, got hella cake
I'm the burger king, having it my way
4-5 with the 38 in my bank
You can't get shit up on my tray
Long as my kids do what I say
You gotta be careful wit' what you say
Nigga they'll use it in the court the next day

[Hook]
I know that these streets don't love me
I know that these bitches don't love me
I know that these niggas don't love me
Where you were when we were on front street
Phony love, these niggas filled with phony love
Gotta keep doing the shit that shorties love
I ain't got no time, hurry up
Another home run, I'm Barry Bonds
