[Intro]
Know how I'm rocking man
Like cut off stockings man
Keep kush in my pocket man
All designer get ya grind on nigga
Got a breitling for the time nigga
Bang!

[Chorus]
10 toes down
I got shows and verse I'ma bring 'em to your town
For the right fucking amount You can hit me up right now
50 for a show and 20 for a 12
I'ma loose screw I ain't no nail
Walk up in the building she either smell the loud or Chanel
I think she going for the kill
She steady calling my phone, my battery she damn near killed it
My phone steady ringing, this bitch done damn killed me

[Verse 1]
What's on my line? That fff beep, it be calling all the time
What's that? My gun
I up this motherfucker, blow it, make ya run, better run
Lil' Gump, Run Forrest, Run!
3 grams in the blunt, we have 1 on 1s
I love getting money and I know ya know it man
You don't like me then show it why the fuck you hold it in?
I walk in and break the bank, then walk out and close you in
What the fuck you looking at? I swear I don't know you man
I'm saying, Im a Glo man, I don't need no tan
I pull up, hop out, standing in my stance

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Eurrrt Skrrrt pulling off, I'm so raw
Haha high a lot, ruff ruff I'm a dog
Chh-chh go my paws
'Cause those fuckers itch a lot
Bitch I got my bong, I don't want you, take me home
I be smoking skunky, got it from the loft
'Member selling junkies, now I gotten dope
'Member red monkeys, closet full of Trues
If you looking for me, I'm probably on the news
1 plus 2, that equals a few
I want ten times 500,000 cool
I pull up rude, my jewelry du-du
Brick and balony in my pocket, Milonakis stew!

[Chorus]
