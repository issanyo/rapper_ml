[Intro]
Skrr skrr skrr
Skrr skrr skrr, skrr, skrr
How you doing? Bitch, I'm f... (fine today)

[Hook]
How you doing? Bitch, I'm fine today
Walking 'round the trap, find a K
All these niggas fake, niggas hate
All I do is money penetrate
All I do is flex on they thots
Pull up, I flex on they block
Diamonds shining, K.O.D and it's dark
Pull up to the office in a Rarri

[Verse 1]
Pulling up to cameo in Bentleys
Pull up to the mansion in that ten ten
That ten Lambo, it ain't rented
A nigga let me get it
Man I swear to God
Now I be living large
Now I be in then cars
And, I be shining hard
Got that money, then I put my car in park
And I rain it in the dark
Smoking kush and  this shit hard
Bitch, I'm dumb and I'm smart

[Hook]
How you doing? Bitch, I'm fine today
Walking 'round the trap to find a K
All these niggas fake, niggas hate
All I do is money penetrate
All I do is flex on they thots
Pull up, I flex on they block
Diamonds shining, K.O.D and it's dark
Pull up to the office in a Rarri

[Verse 2]
I got some money in the closet
Money in the bank deposit
Money for a show
And I might not even go
Pull up to the G5 in a Rarri
And pull off with they thotty
My car an autostarter
My car on autopilot
Bitch that money be my logic
And you know that shit is obvious
I'ma get a hundred mill, no flarging
Just sit back and watch me
Bitch my birthday in August
I'ma lion in the target
Going fast like a cheetah
When I hop up in my Beamer

[Hook]
How you doing? Bitch, I'm fine today
Walking 'round the trap, find a K
All these niggas fake, niggas hate
All I do is money, penetrate
All I do is flex on they thots
Pull up, I flex on they block
Diamonds shining, K.O.D and it's dark
Pull up to the office in a Rarri
