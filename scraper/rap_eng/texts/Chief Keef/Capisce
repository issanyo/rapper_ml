[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
What's happening? Wagwan?
She give me neck then forgot
I'm in the future like Tron
You know it costed, it's from designers
Don't be crossing the lines
But you won't watch lights [?]
It's glory boys jet - ain't no a car
These niggas ain't seeing
These niggas blind
I can get flyer than a Kay
Whatchu been smoking is ice
She gon ride it like a bike
I dissapear out of sight
You know it can't beat my [?]
And i know a lotta essays
More ink...

[Hook: Chief Keef]
Where My Shoes, Capisce
One hundred degrees - Capisce
Get the fendi - Capisce
I got the bitch - Capisce
Hit the Xan - Capisce
I won't stay - Si
I told my chef he say Si
Tell you woulda seek
Cops ask what i did see
You need the A you got the C
You speak Español - Si
So much smoke out of the window - Si

[Verse: 2] Tadoe
Sippin on this damn lean i failed my piss test
Sippin on this damn mud i missed your bitch text
Blew me up, all night, i'm gonna hit that
...
