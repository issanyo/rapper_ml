[Hook]
I go anywhere for some fees
I go anywhere smoking trees
I go anywhere with my G's
G L O G A N G
I go anywhere for some cheese
I go anywhere we can meet
I go everywhere with my heat
I go everywhere with my P's

[Verse 1]
Look at my pieces
The diamonds turn to pieces
Its all up in my necklace
I feel like I'm neckless
Bitch I'm a genius
I gotta thank Jesus
Jesus
When you getting money they hate you
I dont give a fuck
I still keep my pistol tucked
I still let my pistol blow
And I still hop in my truck

[Hook]
I go anywhere for some fees
I go anywhere smoking trees
I go anywhere with my G's
G L O G A N G
I go anywhere for some cheese
I go anywhere we can meet
I go everywhere with my heat
I go everywhere with my P's

[Verse 2]
I'm off this dope I be fiending
Go to sleep I be dreaming
Of a hundred fucking bills
Bills, hundred fucking mils
I dont fuck with niggas
But I be fucking these bitches
I be riding in Bentleys
That ain't shit to me
I be fucking all the women
Now that I get Benji's
When I was broke
I swear I think I was a joke

[Hook]
I go anywhere for some fees
I go anywhere smoking trees
I go anywhere with my G's
G L O G A N G
I go anywhere for some cheese
I go anywhere we can meet
I go everywhere with my heat
I go everywhere with my P's
