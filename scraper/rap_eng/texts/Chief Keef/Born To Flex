[Hook]
Bitch I was born to flex, I am gonna flex
Put it up on my set, I am gonna flex
I still carry my Tec and I am gonna blow that
Let a nigga try to flex and act like he ain't know that
We bussing our gat, that is your death
I'm smoking this pack, got me so there
Cops knocking on my door, no he is not there
Bitch you can't be with me, be with yourself

[Verse 1]
This bitch got me fucked up
Come through, shooting shit right up
Pussy boy see us, duck
Niggas know what to us, nuthin'
Hop in the whip, I press buttons
She ain't tryna top me, press the eject button
I hop that she ain't left nothing
Cause I'm taking off with this car, paid a jet buddy
Flexing hard and throwing sets, buddy
You flex me, shoot your chest buddy
AK with a knife, this bitch coming
I ain't got time for hoes but I fucked a ship of hoes at 6 something
I want extra something, I flex overnight
Come through scaring shit bitch, Poultergeist
He sneaking dissing the Glo, he must not want his life
We send shots for free, holidays and overnights

[Hook]
Bitch I was born to flex, I am gonna flex
Put it up on my set, I am gonna flex
I still carry my Tec and I am gonna blow that
Let a nigga try to flex and act like he ain't know that
We bussing our gat, that is your death
I'm smoking this pack, got me so there
Cops knocking on my door, no he is not there
Bitch you can't be with me, be with yourself
