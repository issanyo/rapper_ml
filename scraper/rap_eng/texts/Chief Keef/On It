[Intro : Chief Keef]
Thotties, Posse!

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I got alotta bitches, and I got alotta niggas
And I got alotta shooters and I got alotta killers
And I got alotta money, I been with this money bunny
I can't help my money funny, baby I am money hungry
More Sosa less Tony, I bought an island no Coney dummy
I'm coolin in Hawaii, countin' money countin' money money
All these niggas phony phony, all these bitches bony bony
Niggas act like homies homies, that's why I be on it on it

[Verse 2 : Chief Keef]
Niggas act like they your friends
But niggas all pretend
Niggas act like they your homie
All these niggas fuckin' phony, I know it
Riding in that mortal combat
With a lot of fucking combat for combat
Nigga don't run, come back
Told your bitch "don't run, come back"
Take this dick, nigga clit clat get back
On that hot shit, you can get whacked
18 wheeler shit, you can get wet
Throw it back to my bitches
