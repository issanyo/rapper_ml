[Intro: Chief Keef]
Gang gang
You know how we ballin, man

[Hook: Chief Keef]
Poor the lean, I go to sleep
Poppin out, ? loaded
In a spot that's all OG
Ten? with me?
Fourty shows a day, that's me, you get ten shows a week
Slide through, ten gloccs?

I go more nuts than a pay day

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
But I go more nuts than a nutty bar
I pop out, and make it rain lke it's pay day
Getting ? aka me roll ?
