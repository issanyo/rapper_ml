[Chorus]
All these niggas talk like they trap gods, talking like they so hard, they ain't never sold hard
And I know that I'm a rapper, I can have thirty niggas up in your yard
And I sip too much damn lean and you would think I always had a cold
And his bitch saw my pistol and touched it, I'm like, "What you touched that for?"
Unless you finna shoot some shit for So
Don't touch my pistol
'Cause I don't wanna have to blow ya
'Cause I don't wanna have to go to jail

[Verse 1]
I'm high as fuck like oh well
Shooting shit like hold them
He said he know me, I don't know him
I'm flexing on these niggas, no gym
I got indicted selling coke and selling dope
I don't wanna do that shit no more
But you can come and sell it for me though
Don't tell nobody on me though
I don't wanna have to move to Puerto Rico
And change everything on my ID though
'Cause I'll never snitch on my 'migos
'Cause when I bought 6 from him, he gave me 4 more

[Chorus]
All these niggas talk like they trap gods, talking like they so hard, they ain't never sold hard
And I know that I'm a rapper, I can have thirty niggas up in your yard
And I sip too much damn lean and you would think I always had a cold
And his bitch saw my pistol and touched it, I'm like, "What you touched that for?"
Unless you finna shoot some shit for So
Don't touch my pistol
'Cause I don't wanna have to blow ya
'Cause I don't wanna have to go to jail

[Verse 2]
Don't stalk me now, got a Glock on me now
Wish a nigga would try to follow me, BOW
The block hot, the cops hot
Finna go to New Orleans to the Mardi Gras
She a hot thot, she was already dropped
I'm tryna see if money love me or not
But I think money love me a lot
Try to take my shit, let the chopper flop
Like grah grah, grah grah
Chopper going for 'em like rah rah
Like ah ah, ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah
All these niggas talking like they trap god
Till they ass get robbed

[Chorus]
All these niggas talk like they trap gods, talking like they so hard, they ain't never sold hard
And I know that I'm a rapper, I can have thirty niggas up in your yard
And I sip too much damn lean and you would think I always had a cold
And his bitch saw my pistol and touched it, I'm like, "What you touched that for?"
Unless you finna shoot some shit for So
Don't touch my pistol
'Cause I don't wanna have to blow ya
'Cause I don't wanna have to go to jail
