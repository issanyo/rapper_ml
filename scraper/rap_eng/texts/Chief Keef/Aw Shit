[Intro]
Aw Shit (x4)
Be Cautious (x3)
Aw Shit (Hann)

[Hook]
Bitches see me, they like aw shit
All my cars foreign
All my niggas reckless, don't run up on them
My click is enormous
My bitch's ass is humongous
This what them hoes say when I pull up on them
Aw shit (x16)

[Verse 1]
Boy please be cautious
Chief Sosa money talking
If you ain't money taking then why the fuck you talking
Walk up in the club and them bottles get to sparking
Bitch I don't drink you can give that to my brothers
Chief Sosa a reefer chiefer get that from my momma
I fuck that nigga's bitch that he was undercover loving
I even fucked his cousin and that bitch gotta husband
I know I be stunting and I don't talk tough for nothing
Bitch I'm money hunting
You ain't got enough checks
I leave niggas upset cause he ain't got nothing
My 24s they rubbing, I'm O'Block 300
They see us they like aw shit look at all the foreigns

[Hook]
