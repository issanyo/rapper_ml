[Hook: Tadoe]
Remember runnin' in the house just ridin' steamers
Now I pull up mansion, foreign beamers
That bitch she all on me, take a breather
A nigga try to rob me, I won't leave him
Caught tha nigga lackin', let him have it
I'ma buy 10 traps instead of a mansion
He don't want no smoke, he scared of that gas
Nigga don't want no money I think he scared of that cabbage

[Verse: Chief Keef]
You say you gon' buy 10 traps instead of a mansion
Well I'm gon' buy a mansion instead of 10 traps
Cuz I got indicted doin' that shit already
And judge [?] trynna send my black ass back
Pussy you better watch that back
That bitch gave me top and it's not that bad
Cuz you know I got that bag
Took that bitch to my house and she seen that maid, checkin out that trap//trash (?)
Bitch these Balenciagas on my feet
[These ain't no damn] 11s or no 5s
Nigga totin' revolvers for they heat
Niggas ain't shootin' no 40s or 45s
Give Tadoe the 30, my 40 tote 45
Blood money got the mac and he gon' pimp your ride
Niggas ain't gettin' no cabbage
Took 20Gs motherfucker, and I done count it back
Say you gon squeeze motherfucker but i doubt it, that shit happened
Tryna kill me muthafucka like tryna kill Captain America
"What's your chain Chief Sosa?", about 84 karats
And I'm only 18, muthafucka but y'all just live with your parents
Got niggas with heaters, need feature, [?]
Bad bitch say she seen us, but hood friends ain't believers
She'll eat us like a pizza, cuz i'm cool like a freezer
Remember ridin' steamers, but now I can have 10 beamers
