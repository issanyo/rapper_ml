Paul Walker bitch, Fast N Furious
Ridin' real fast and I'm serious
Is ya getting money boy? I'm curious
All this money making me delirious
Paul Walker bitch, Fast N Furious
In a jet, bitch I am lerious
Shining bright bitch, my diamonds are the silliest
My bitches are the prettiest
My cars are the hideous

[Verse]
Bitches look like monsters
Bitch them bitches look like Tonkas
I'm riding in a Tonka
Looking like I'm Yahweh
Yao Ming, bitch I'm with the Houston Rockets
And I got the rocket in my pocket, best believe I will pop it
Best believe you'll get dropped and be rolling
Can't tell witcha breath nigga hold it
Hear the ambulance come
I hope they can save ya, son
I hope they can save ya, homeboy
Shouldn't have been playin' homeboy
What the fuck was ya sayin' homeboy?
GRA-TA-TAH-DUH-DUH-DUH, we ain't playing homeboy
