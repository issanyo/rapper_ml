[Hook: Chief Keef]
Man I got that swag, and I got that bag
When I hit the mall, I love poppin' tags
I love poppin' tags, I love poppin' tags
So much shit in my bag, cause I love poppin' tags
I love poppin' tags, I love poppin' tags
Smokin' loud gotta bag, and I love poppin' tags
I love poppin' tags, I love poppin' tags
I get so much cash and I love poppin' tags

[Verse 1: LeekeLeek]
100 round drummer
I come from the slammer
Ski mask in the winter
Rob a dice game in the summer
Bank account, Obama
Bitch I'm flexin' with these commas
He just lost a stack
I know where's at cause bitch I took it from 'em
Your bitch been on me lately
Is she suckin' dick or somethin'
Cause I'd rather count some 50's
She say, I'd rather blow some hundreds
From West Coast to the East Coast
I got hoes with different numbers
I can't see you with binoculars
Cause boy you ain't been doing nothin'
If I don't do nothin' I'ma keep two greedy hustlers
Money gettin' old, growin' legs money runnin'
Choppa standin' tall, pill jab in my balls
With that .30 and that .50 ain't no problem I can't solve

[Hook]

[Verse 2: LeekeLeek]
Ballin' with money, how you think I got this money
Livin' life like ain't no money
Bitch designer shit is for me
Chasin' hoes not a chance
Hit the block and chase a band
Bein' broke again, that's that shit won't see again
Hoes all on my Instagram, like I'm turnin' up for them
Too greedy in demand so bitch I'm goin' ham
JB Guapo who is that? That's Lil G he blowin' back
Disrespect I'm at yo front
Paperboy still got the back
Paperboy still got the mac
Shout out A-block, keep it cool
I be out west countin' oochie
Off a dice game break a fool
Hittin' licks, hittin' licks
Shit ain't been the same since
That Ballin' beat, ho that Ballin' beat

[Hook]
