How can I not spend it? I’m so used to getting it
Club shit ape, your bitch so used to spitting

Cribs longer than a projects, loud
Smoking like a fire place
And I thumb through a check, I’m a A1 vet
Back then I didn’t really have much, but right now I’m getting it

But that don’t mean I love her, so save that shit
