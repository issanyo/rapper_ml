Dirty Sprite baby that's that dirty citrus
Flexin' on these niggas, Bally Total Fitness

What I'm doing bitch I'm tryna get some bitches
Walked up in the bank just to get my riches
Walked up in the bank with Glo them my niggas
Look at my wrist, look like I be flippin' chickens
Put on all my jewelry, pulled up on some bitches

I came in the club with my snub
Nigga flexin then he get that tough love
