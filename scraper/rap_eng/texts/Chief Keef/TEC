[Hook: Chief Keef]
Boy hold my jewelry it's a pound
Brick on my wrist right now
And I'm finna go and scoop ya bitch
And I'm finna go and scoop some kicks
Finna pull up on my ex
Pull up on my ex make that bitch mad
"I ain't got no fucking type of respect
But I heard you get respect with TEC"
Boy hold my jewelry it's a pound
Brick on my wrist right now
And I'm finna go and scoop ya bitch
And I'm finna go and scoop some kicks
Finna pull up on my ex
Pull up on my ex make that bitch mad
"I ain't got no fucking type of respect
But I heard you get respect with TEC"

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
D-Moe go grab the pound
Thots coming over to suck us right now
Roll up let's get high
Smoke a nigga frown
Let 'em come up in this fucking house
Pistol to his motherfucking mouth
I told him "watch this motherfucking mouth"
Who the fuck talking now?
Flexin, look at my muscle (look at my motherfuckin' muscle)
My truck got a muscle (truck got a motherfuckin' muscle)
It ain't American, it's foreign
My bitch ain't American, she foreign
She is from Dubai
I got that check, then I flew by I roll by
Didn't stop for nobody
I don't fuck with nobody
I'll hop out and fuck your body and your party
We'll come through, shoot your party
Who told you to party? Not GloGang
Fuck boy you is a no name

[Hook: Chief Keef]
Boy hold my jewelry it's a pound

Finna pull up on my ex
Pull up on my ex make that bitch mad
"I ain't got no fucking type of respect

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
I just bought a chopper let's do a hit
You wifin' her, she doing dicks
I got a .30 with a stick
I'm Glo Gang, we hella rich
These niggas hate but niggas bitches
These niggas tellin, niggas snitches
And you know snitches they get stitches
Pulling up and you get digits
Talking numbers, hunnid rounds
Catch you lacking it's man down
When I kill you, Ima frown
Ain't no fucking laughing or playing around
