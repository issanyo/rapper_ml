[Hook: Chief Keef]
Put your techs up, put your macs up
SK's HK's, put your gats up
Put your setz up, put your setz up
Put your setz up, put your setz up

Put your techs up, put your macs up
Sk's hk's put your gats up
Put your setz up, put your setz up
Put your setz up, put your setz up

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Put your setz up, put your setz up
From the other side you get wet up
We don't believe in luck, but I am next up
Have that ambulance come and get up
Shoot his fuckin' face, blood on my wheats
We got a lot of heat, we can shoot for weeks
You a dead nigga, in big words, deceased
I ain't gotta talk, let this choppa speak
Ima go nuts, dont worry 'bout it
Gon' kill me bitch nigga, don't be a girl about it
Otf man, cause niggas snitches
Throwin' L'z up till I'm dead or in prison
Fuck a MOB, put money over bitches
Fuck a Shondale, Imma rot in hell
Imma maintenance man, I gotta lotta nails
Attitude stink, kush what you smell

[Hook]
