[Chorus]
Count that cash fast
And you know I'm smokin' big gas bags
Hit Saks with big ass cash backs
Don't come to Chiraq, you're better off in Baghdad
Where the fuck is the money? Let me get that
Everyday designer, but it's mismatched
Where that Reese money 'cause we need that
Ain't see you on yo block, but we gon' be back

[Verse 1]
I got big knots, in my Balmains
I be balling, like a ball game
Get to sparkin', no talkin'
Chopper in the bag, make the mall rain
Bitch, it's Chief So, where the beef go?
Talking like you 'bout it, where your teeth go?
I got the heat though, for niggas trickos
Stack blue cheese up, like they Pringles

[Chorus]
Count that cash fast
And you know I'm smokin' big gas bags
Hit Saks with big ass cash backs
Don't come to Chiraq, you're better off in Baghdad
Where the fuck is the money? Let me get that
Everyday designer, but it's mismatched
Where that Reese money 'cause we need that
Ain't see you on yo block, but we gon' be back

[Verse 2]
Hop in a switch up, commit a pick up
I'm in a foreign truck, gettin' my dick sucked
New Louies, come take a picture
Commit a touchdown, from a kick-up
2 3 finna stick up, how your stick-up?
How your funds up? How your quick-up?
When it's time for the hit, uh, don't catch the hiccups
You ain't really 'bout it, give that stick up

[Chorus]
Count that cash fast
And you know I'm smokin' big gas bags
Hit Saks with big ass cash backs
Don't come to Chiraq, you're better off in Baghdad
Where the fuck is the money? Let me get that
Everyday designer, but it's mismatched
Where that Reese money 'cause we need that
Ain't see you on yo block, but we gon' be back
