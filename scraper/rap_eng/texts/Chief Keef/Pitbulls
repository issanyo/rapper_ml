[Verse 1: AM]
Drop-top, headshot when your roof down
A Mally with the bali, got a new sound
Boop-boop-boop-boop, that's a tre pound
And now your thinking that you should’a never came out
12-gauge dot-dot
Chat shit, get shot
This spots got hot, gotta change out
Catting for a hot-wok, or a steakhouse
And if my nigga don't eat, I'mma spray rounds
And if my nigga got beef then it’s my war
How many niggas in your set would you die for?
And if your nigga got shot, would you shoot back?
You got a gun, but you don't know how to use dat

[Chorus]
Mind how you talk on the phone
My two pitbulls walk around on their own
It's best that you leave me alone
My bro got his watch from Sierra Leone
Mind how you talk on the phone
My two pitbulls walk around on their own
It's best that you leave me alone
My bro got his watch from Sierra Leone

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
You got a trap but don't know how to get it jumpin'
You in a fast car, but don't even know how to push it
I'm in a fast car, getting T like I’m Pusha
You say you a killer, but now we gotta push ya’
Two 30's under tee, like I’m Booker
Slide on ya late night, like a hooker
Send my young boy to smoke you like a hookah
They gon' think that he a chef when he cook ya'
Pick a chop stick up, and chop you like a butcher
Take the magazine, now we pluggin' like it’s hooked up
You be shootin' in the air like your shit looked up
Let it go til' ain't no more like my shit booked up

[Verse 3: Skengdo]
They're like "Skeng, you better calm down"
Your gonna end up locked or rottin' in the ground
But they know I can't stop, I gotta make the pound
Old school, out the window, wouldn't make a sound
Hella man chatty, yeah they're bitches
The bitches tellin' me I should do kissing
She's mythin'
Only the cash I'd be lipsing
The big ting, she shoves it in her mouth, she ain't thinkin'
Dem man der fear the kitchen
But that's cool, cah the corn game is different
You don't wanna see my dargs when we risen
You don't wanna see my dargs when we risen

[Chorus: AM]
Mind how you talk on the phone
My two pitbulls walk around on their own
It's best that you leave me alone
My bro got his watch from Sierra Leone
Mind how you talk on the phone
My two pitbulls walk around on their own
It's best that you leave me alone
My bro got his watch from Sierra Leone

[Verse 4: AM]
Gimme one chance, gimme one chance
Shouts Drake but, I don't need One Dance
Need a big red bone, with the bumboclaat?
And hometime, if she can't hold firearms
I don't fuck with that bitch, if that bitch is lame
The only reason she about cah' she givin' brain (Noddy)
And she a 10 out of 10, then I'm running game
And I attempt to catch a M, it's in my fucking name
I attempt to catch a M, it's in my fucking name
I attempt to catch a M, it's in my fucking name
And she a 10 out of 10, then I'm running game
And I attempt to catch a M, it's in my fucking name
I was upsuh, billin' up, billin' up grub
I'm a shotta, living up in the gutter
With a rasta
Spinner up, helicopter
Then I fucked up
Hit and run
I got sucked up

[Chorus: AM]
Mind how you talk on the phone
My two pitbulls walk around on their own
It's best that you leave me alone
My bro got his watch from Sierra Leone
Mind how you talk on the phone
My two pitbulls walk around on their own
It's best that you leave me alone
My bro got his watch from Sierra Leone
