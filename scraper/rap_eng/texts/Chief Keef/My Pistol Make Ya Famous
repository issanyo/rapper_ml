[Hook: Chief Keef (Fredo Santana)]
You could find me in the trap, on the map
So much lean, I might collapse
You could find me in a bank
So much rank
So much stank
I'm finna faint
(You can find me in a trap, gang banging
Smoking stank
Pistol hanging
I'm on the block
Gang banging
Chain dangling
Let my pistol make you famous

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
My choppa make you famous
Want beef? I got the Angus
This iPhone on me ancient
Where's the recipe, I'm Plankton
I got this foreign stanking
Man I deserve a spanking
I'm in here eating ramen
Noodles with a banger
I'm always on the catch up
Pour it without it measured
I am the young flexer
All this gold on look like treasure
All these fucking pints
I am a professor
But don't make my shooters
Put you on a stretcher
I'm smoking on this dope
Counting on these bandz
Big ass four nickle
It is in my pants
Fucking up my stance
I'm fucking up these bandz
When you get a glance you see I don't do the playing

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Basic man, ya'll basic man
I'm the king of trapping, embrace it man
Have them killers pull up and straight change your plan
They'll kill you first then they will wack your mans
Niggas think it's sweet till I pull up slaying their mans
Remember posted on the block off the exit rim
Now I sell wock and I think I lost a kidney
I nigga wanna box, what he don't see my semi?
Beat his ass up, smoke his ass like a chimney
Cooling with some thots and they gone off the Henny
But I smack one of these hoes if they ever try to offend me
I'm shooting shit like the old Michael Finley
Bought a FN but I could have bought a Fendi
