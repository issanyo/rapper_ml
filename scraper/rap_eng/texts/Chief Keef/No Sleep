[Chorus: Eearz]
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
Don't wanna be a sheep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
Don't wanna be a sheep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Don't wanna be a sheep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I'm so hungry you hear the creak in my tummy
I'm so high off greek you hear the creak in my tummy
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us

[Verse 1: Eearz]
You can live for me, you wanna seek out your glory
Say a prayer mama taught me before I sleep (Amen)
Me and my family we proud up in the bed six deep
I was caught up and then I saw my pops and peeps
I can hear the weeps and the hallways can hear the weeps
Brought me to the rooms and he told me something so scary
Blank stare at the wall, I swear I couldn't even blink
Me fourteen years old, going on like thirty-three
Tapped into the savage on that day is what I mean
Tables turned you feel you cannot turn the other cheek
From then on everything was a plate no nigga eat

[Chorus: Eearz]
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
Don't wanna be a sheep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Don't wanna be a sheep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I'm so hungry you hear the creak in my tummy
I'm so hungry you hear the creak in my tummy
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Walked up in the bank there's so much cash I gotta take
Twenty-sixteen there's so much cash I gotta make
Excuse me, vegetarian that's so much bad up on my plate
That's steak, spicy garlic, man that's a normal date
I'm hot now, I can't stop now, I'm on fire
I make your bitch tat me on her back, I'm a wire
It take blood, sweat, and tears, but I am not a crier
The way Ben Franklin sing, he make me think I'm a choir
Sosa got the strap, you know I wear it like a bomber
Act like you don't in the middle of December, turn to summer
The way I make your bitch hot, I'm a stove, Harry Potter
This mathematics, you can leave if you ain't talking numbers

[Chorus: Eearz]
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
Don't wanna be a sheep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Don't wanna be a sheep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I'm so hungry you hear the creak in my tummy
I'm so hungry you hear the creak in my tummy
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat

[Verse 3: Eearz]
Lean on me like Morgan Freeman, no further you shall see
Pacing in circles in the darkness, won't the light come follow me
But to lose your heartâ€™s been molded to withstand all of the roads
Stomach folding, this the greatest story ever told
I knew that I was a legend more now than before
Wait two nights to my last bitch and let this money mold
Flew by you in quite a flash, few nights I saw you pass
Stay up on my path, I bet I be here laughing lastly

[Verse 4: Eearz]
Wings up on your back and the wind beneath your feet
Watch the game we play, you can get tricked up off the street
Days like Halloween, you can get tricked and be a treat
Won't happen to me, I sink my teeth into they sweet

[Chorus: Eearz]
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
Don't wanna be a sheep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
Don't wanna be a sheep I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I'm so hungry you hear the creak in my tummy
I'm so hungry you hear the creak in my tummy
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
We don't get no sleep it mean way more for us to eat
