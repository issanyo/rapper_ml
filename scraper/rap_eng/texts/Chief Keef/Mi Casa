Bitch mi casa su casa, I'm the black Hugh Hefner
I love gettin' money, I got band like some contra
Girl go smoke this ganja, this ain't no Willy Wonka
First I had a 'Rari, now riding in my Tonka
Watching out for coppers, set hoppin' boppers
Used to sell that shit they put up in they nostrils
'Til I got indicted off it
Now I'm Almighty Sosa, I put it out, they cop it

[Verse 1]
Y'all ain't sippin' lean, that's some Karo
I need 20 for a verse and 50 for a show
I be killing niggas like Liu Kang do 'em
'Cause I just came from Nielsen's, spent 10 bands on a four wheeler
Got some bad bitches out in Cancun
Ready to give me knee knee, and do what ever I say to
I hit DC, yeah, let's go to Stadium
Order 3000 ones just to make it rain on 'em
I know you see me, give me some knee knee
Niggas put your glasses on 'cause I'm comin' 3-D
Bitch, I'm a genie, you gon' need me
But you got some good brain, you a genius

[Verse 2]
I got 6 bedrooms
I got 6 bathrooms, bitch
What you wanna do, bitch?
Steady asking what I would do if I was you, bitch
I got a question, should I buy a coupe, bitch?
And if you see the opps, is you gon' shoot, bitch?
And if you see the cops, you ain't gon' snooze, bitch
Well, don't be worried 'bout me, ain't worried 'bout you, bitch
Don't make me spill this Act' up on my shoes, bitch
I'm high off this thrax, it got me boomin'
They like, "Sosa stop using auto-tunin'!
You ain't the same, your career is through, bitch"
