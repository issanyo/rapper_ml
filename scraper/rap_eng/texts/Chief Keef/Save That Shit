[Hook]
She say she love me whatever that is
Do me a favor, save that shit
Like bad kids, bitch we reckless
Ball hard, stunt like taxes
He say he know Sosa, he be lacking
Do me a favor, save that shit
You fuck niggas better stay packing
A lot of extended clips, no acting

[Verse 1]
She say she know Sosa, he be flexing
Pull up windows down, smell refreshing
Good loud pack, smell like cat piss
Hanging out the roof, young and reckless
Rocking in my Rock jeans
@CampaignSosa every nigga following
I ain't with the arguing
My niggas come, click clack, no arguing
She say she love me whatever that is
We see a opp, shit get hectic
A lot of extended clips, no acting
No sex bitch I only want the neck bitch

[Hook]
She say she love me whatever that is
Do me a favor, save that shit
Like bad kids, bitch we reckless
Ball hard, stunt like taxes
He say he know Sosa, he be lacking
Do me a favor, save that shit
You fuck niggas better stay packing
A lot of extended clips, no acting
