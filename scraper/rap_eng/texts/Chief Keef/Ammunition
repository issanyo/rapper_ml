[Hook]
Why they didn't took my shit in that alley
Say she love me, whatever that mean (stop it)
The only colors I like is blue, pink and green
Think I play guitar how I'm pulling these strings
Think I play Fifa How I'm kicking with your bitch
She steady talking 'bout knocking you of the pick
"His lifestyle really ain't expensive"
Put a drum on, it be giving that ammunition

[Verse 1]
O-K, I'm re-loaded
Going down begin, call these, explosives
My gas tank over, I didn't even know it
This bitch got [?] I didn't drove it
I don't even like them all, I don't even go there
This bitch got nothing in there, I don't blow them
Got new thots named Codie and Sonia, both got long hair
Pull the mic up outta my pants and let 'em perform there
Pull out bag of cash out the baggy bag
Whatever you know as a two, bitch, don't ask me that
Talking that military code with the gang, 10-4 copy that
Anything but late for dinner, I be that

[Hook]
Why they didn't took my shit in that alley
Say she love me, whatever that mean (stop it)
The only colors I like is blue, pink and green
Think I play guitar how I'm pulling these strings
Think I play Fifa How I'm kicking with your bitch
She steady talking 'bout knocking you of the pick
"His lifestyle really ain't expensive"
Put a drum on, it be giving that ammunition

[Verse 2]
Giving ammunition
[?]
Doing duh-duh-duh that's the hicups
Ion give three two or one fucks
Free T-slick outta the Joint
Even though folks got only one eye
Don't keep him from being on point
[?] see your sin
Gotta stay low-key gotta stay blended
Granny ain't cared if i finished [?]
[?] told me to handle my business

My fucked up ways I'm trynna get rid of it
[?] Ain't trynna get cuffed, ain't trynna [?]
[?]
This shit that you talking I ain't trynna hear it

[Hook]
Why they didn't took my shit in that alley
