[Intro]
I don't trust no one
Baby, I don't tust no one but my gun
But my gun
I don't tust no one but my gun
And my ones
No one but my gun
No one

[Hook]
I don't trust no one but my gun
Kush fucking up my lungs
Niggas talking from behind
Bitches tryna set you up
There go Almighty, they like what
My guns be strong bodied, bitch play tough
My niggas hard bodied, bitch say what
Now your block red taped up

[Verse 1]
Now your block red taped up in it
Pistol shots, take that shit
Smoking on dope with a little cigarette
Got the racks on my pocket and the Tec on the bed
A nigga on the front door, a nigga on the back door
Come in here and blanked out forgot what I said
I wonder what Tec would've said
I wonder what Mac would've said
Coolin' with the lean, (?) would've said
Disrespect then that's a cap to the head
Come on your block set up shops,get the popping at heads, arms, shoulders, bitch and them legs
Broke wrist on my wrist, broke leg on my neck
Glo on you, not down for this shit
Niggas wanna gamble with their life, put them in a jeopardy van
Smoking on this reefer, sipping on this lean tequila
Come on your block, me and ether
Shooting your family tree up
The Glo got clips like theaters
Walk around the whole wide world, just t'd up
Jay said he gone buy me a kilo, I'm gone be key'd up
Kilos in my ears, tryna take it, me speak up
And the .233 speaking, what nina need to speak for
Momma always told me never follow be a leader
Riding in a foreign ass car with no license, hop in the seat belt

[Hook]
I don't trust no one but my gun
Kush fucking up my lungs
Niggas talking from behind
Bitches tryna set you up
There go Almighty, they like what
My guns be strong bodied, bitch play tough
My niggas hard bodied, bitch say what
Now your block red taped up

[Verse 2]
My name Sosa Peter
Don't make these pans get to ringing
Fucking around with my green and
I ain't friendly bitch, I'm greenly
Me and green fight like Ike and Tina
Cause sometimes I be lazy, minding my business
And sometimes I be fucking with other bitches
Walk in the bank like give me all of my riches
Remember when I was broke but now I'm full of richness
I still got niggas on my hit list
I still got bitches on my to-do list
And I still got niggas on my boot list
Her majesty came through, after we came through banging
Little bitty boy ain't have no business gang banging
Bought a little bitty toy and a big Tonka truck just to hang in
Bought some credit guns and bought a bunch of clothes just to hang with
Cause...

[Hook]
I don't trust no one but my gun
Kush fucking up my lungs
Niggas talking from behind
Bitches tryna set you up
There go Almighty, they like what
My guns be strong bodied, bitch play tough
My niggas hard bodied, bitch say what
Now your block red taped up
