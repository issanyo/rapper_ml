[Intro]
Turn me up Josh
Kingston
Yeah man
Booted up
Kingston
Count up

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
I've been grindin' bustin' money, juugs round the city, ah yeah
Can't stand these fake niggas, please get 'em from round me, ah yeah
All I ever needed was my squad and a bad bitch
All I ever wanted was a foreign and a mansion

[Verse 1: Sean Kingston]
All I ever wanted was a chick that stayed down now
Smokin' on this kush got me high off in the clouds now
Woah now, I'm so up, can't come down
Movin' too fast, baby slow down
Started from the trap, now we here now
And we here now
Badman, badman, so we go flex
Pussy while I talk, boy we no check
Got a kilo diamond chain around me neck
Wastin' my time when I see them
Make them shawty like the deep end
(?) weekend

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
I've been grindin' bustin' money, juugs round the city, ah yeah
Can't stand these fake niggas, please get 'em from round me, ah yeah
All I ever needed was my squad and a bad bitch
All I ever wanted was a foreign and a mansion
I've been grindin' bustin' money, juugs round the city, ah yeah
Can't stand these fake niggas, please get 'em from round me, ah yeah
All I ever needed was my squad and a bad bitch
All I ever wanted was a foreign and a mansion

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I done got a mansion
She ain't tryna fuck till the bitch get up out it
Look in my pantses
Tryna find the racks but it's oh-so crowded
You could be my tenant
I could be the land lord, how you wanna go about it?
You could be lieutenant
I'ma flip the Marlboro do you wanna blow about it?
Pulled up while goin'
She like "Chief Sosa, I'm surprised you got the top on"
And I got my Glock on
But it's got a stock clip on, put the mop on
Frog nigga hop on
Pulled up bling-blinging, thought I was a Hot Boy
Bought 50 Trap Lords
I be from Chicago but we just not goin'

[Hook: Sean Kingston]
I've been grindin' bustin' money, juugs round the city, ah yeah
Can't stand these fake niggas, please get 'em from round me, ah yeah
All I ever needed was my squad and a bad bitch
All I ever wanted was a foreign and a mansion
I've been grindin' bustin' money, juugs round the city, ah yeah
Can't stand these fake niggas, please get 'em from round me, ah yeah
All I ever needed was my squad and a bad bitch
All I ever wanted was a foreign and a mansion
