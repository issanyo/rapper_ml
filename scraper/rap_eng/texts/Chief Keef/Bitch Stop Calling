[Verse 1]
She keep stalkin me
I keep changing my number trying get her off of me
She want talk to me but sosa hate talkin'
She say just want to get to know me but chief sosa hate talkin'
Because sosa antisocial
Steady sendin' my quotes
She steady texting my phone
I don't reply i leave it open
Smokin on this dope i swear it got me floating
She finna blow my high she like damn i love you sosa
She might be a fan so i think again
But then again she just want fuck me and my mans
She might be a fan so i think again
But then again she just want fuck me and my mans
