Hey, I be kush smokin', car ridin'
Hey, lotta gwop in my pockets now
Hey, nigga disrespect then we knock'em down
Hey, big guns, trees they knock'em down
Hey, so high I take a helicopter down
Hey, show you how I make this fucking chopper sound
Hey, them niggas opps, no we don't fuck wit them
Got ignorants guns, it's gon' up at them (Start cussin')

[Verse 1]
Remember standin' on the block, my hands was on the Glock
Ready to slam it on a opp and give'em all I got
Now I got hammers on the block and drugs on the block
Cops got cameras on the block, they tryna catch us off
Untrustworthy ass bitch, they tryna set us up
Lil dirty ass niggas always stealin' some
Dirty .30 ass wit me and it'll hit you up
I got my jewelry out and my hammer tucked
I got some niggas wit me, come thru blam' it on ya
Shoot him, him, him, and then her
Cause niggas steady talkin' and we didn't know nun
And when the feds grab me mane I didn't know nun
Catch you snoozin' then it's done wit you
I hope you got yo gun wit you
Got 30 shots for Lead, you gon' hold number 2
Cum on yo bitch face like my nut do what cucumbers do

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No Versace, this belt 14 hundo
Opps livin' on a prayer, Bon Jovi
Like a cigar, I catch a opp I'll smoke'em
Like who is these niggas, I don't know them
Eni-meni-minei-moe them, catch a opp 'bout to tote him
Don't know if I'll let go off him, Eni-meni-minei-moe I know it's him
He ain't shootin', I can't roll wit'em
That's my Glo Gang, that's my bro-n-em
Yes I tote things and I'm blowin' dem
Leave you boppin' like Kemo Nem
I just had a baby and I'm keepin' him
He already got a name, his name is Beefilin
Bitch got in my car like what kinda seats is them
You know BMW, my people nem
