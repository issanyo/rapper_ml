[Intro]
Chopsquad
Glo Gang (gang in this bitch, man)
Aye (know how we rockin' like cut off stockings man, keep kush in my pocket man)
Terintino (Almighty Glo Man)
Send a nigga to the doctor
The same young nigga man, nothing changed man
Bang, bang, bang, bang
Blocka, blocka, blocka
Bang, bang

[Hook]
Went and got me a chopper
Just to send a nigga to the doctor
This ho called me, said she need a doctor
I said baby I fix bitches, that's no problem
Would you write me if I was locked up?
Would you like me if I wasn't guaped up?
Balenciagas, I don't wear no Prada (hell nah)
Straight hundreds, I don't take no dollars (hell nah)

[Verse 1]
5 thousand, turn 'em into dollars
In the strip clubs, throw 'em, make 'em holler
I touched 50,000 dollars down to Johnny Dang
But I had to make sure my Grandmama rent paid
'Member playin' cops and robbers
Niggas was cops, I was robbin'
Just seen a car, finna cop it
And how dare a nigga tell me that I'm not, bitch
Baby like why he be on that hot shit?
Boy fuck that hot shit, fuck that hot shit
If it's that guap shit I be on that, I be on that
Lonely at the top, I ain't going back

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Went and got me some guap
'Member when I ain't had none
Went and got me some Baleinciagas
Cause I remembered that's what I wanted
Ridin' in anything I want
And I fuck any thot I want bitch
I be gettin' money, gettin' money
And I be spendin' money, spendin' money
Pull up, sku sku sku, better cuff your honey
If you want her cause I know she love money
And that money shit ain't funny
I always be gettin' money

[Hook: x2]
