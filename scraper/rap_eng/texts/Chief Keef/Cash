[Verse 1: P Wild]
Okay, I started out flexin', ended up finessin'
28 rims with the grams, diamonds bustin'
All I know is work, watch me twerk with the work
Watch me drop a couple blocks
Wash your block with the gloc
Got some bitches on my block, thats gon' set your ass up
Got some shooters on my roster, bet they'll wet your ass up
These bitches call me thirsty, I got liquor in my cup
These niggas think they trapping, but they barley making bucks
I'm a Sluttyboy baby, all you niggas know whats up
All that talking out your mouth is gon get you tossed up in the trunk
I'm with lightshow, Wild, and Chief Keef. GBE, and SB
My real live niggas from the South Side, back to North East

[Hook: Lightshow]
I like my bitches with an ass on them
She want a nigga with some cash on him
But I ain’t spending cash on her
Unless I'm in the strip club throwing cash on her
We play with choppas, don’t get chopped up
Sucka' niggas can't eat, get that gwaup up
Keep your box, get that top up
I'm a flex till I’m dead, I ain’t locked up

[Verse 2: Dew baby]
Adidas in Atlanta I'm in L.A. kissin' Ella
Diamonds in my pinky and my chain sit on my belly
The shit my shooters shootin' leave you shakin' like a dancer
And if you niggas want some smoke, you're not gon' get the cancer
Run em down, gun sound, yellow tape, no escape
I break the whole thing down and bag the shit that’s on the plate
Money chase the bitches, bitches got to chase the money
I pulled up in the Chrysler just to keep that shit 3 hunna (BEEP)
Icy like the winter but I'm shinning like the summer
And we don’t go nowhere without the sticks we like some drummers
Crack just like a plumber, shootin' pistols like they're jumpers
I don’t know what niggas doing, but I know we doing numbers

[Verse 3: Meatchi]
All right, I like my bitches with an ass on em
Who like your bitches to fuck and you spend them bands on her
This niggas tripping and flipping  like they some damn quarters
Fifty ass niggas drown, they can hold they water
Go get that top pried, 30 make their heart stop
With no love, lost my heart, cold like my damn watch
These niggas faggies I hate em, get out my damn car
I got a bitch who suck my dick and then she want to rock
These bitches love me and love me, I see why niggas haten'
And Toby told me kill it, keep them patiently waiting
Cause he'll be home soon, bitch its coming real soon
And everybody screaming “BEEF,” wondering what we doin' to him

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Lightshow]
BITCH
Yeah you babber with the headlight
She ask if that’s the shit I like, bitch you damn right!
I'm that nigga, I'm that nigga, had to say it twice
Middle finger to them blue, white, and them red lights
They say I came up, they say my name poppin'
Now niggas sneak dissin', but they name droppin'
They say that Sluttyboyz game poppin'
And GBE real life, losing ain’t an option
We winning bitch, we fucking up
We bout that check so she gon' fuck with us
I ain’t with that sucka' stuff
I go get that bag just to fuck it up

[Verse 5: Chief Keef]
Ayy, hoes like a nigga with some racks on him
If I was to go broke I'd pull my mask on em
Take him down for his kilos and his marijuana
Sucka' niggas can't eat, we gon' smash on him
Bitch I only like the ass on ya
She gave me top, she let me splash on her
She know I ain’t spending cash on her
But I be counting a lot of bands on her
Hop up in my foreign, do the dash on her
Heat up in my reach, Imma spaz on em
All my niggas savages, don’t make em blast on you
And they gon' leave some toe tags on you (HAWH?)

[Hook]
