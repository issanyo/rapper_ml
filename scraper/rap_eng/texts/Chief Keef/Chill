[Hook]
I get a thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 300 thousand
I get two thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 600 thousand
I get three thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 900 thousand
I get four thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 1.5 mill, nigga chill

[Verse 1]
Shit real in the field
It's either kill or be killed
Bitch I'm swerving on the wheel
With my hand on the gear
With my feet on the pedal
And my heat on my lap
Counting guap, I can't trust a soul
Cuz for money turn to foes
Niggas friend of me
Acting like they kin to me
Acting like they brodies
But they tryna snake me, I know it

[Hook]
I get a thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 300 thousand
I get two thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 600 thousand
I get three thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 900 thousand
I get four thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 1.5 mill, nigga chill

[Verse 2]
For this Moncler, I break bands
No bitch, I don't wear no Ray Bans
I wear Gucci, I wear Louie
Bitch I wear Truey
For these Robins, I pay bands
I be cashing out all day, man
I like coochie, I like movies
I like File Mignon, don't like Sushi

[Hook]
I get a thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 300 thousand
I get two thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 600 thousand
I get three thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 900 thousand
I get four thousand mothafuckas give me 300
That's 1.5 mill, nigga chill
