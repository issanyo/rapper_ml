[Hook]
Swag, throwing b's up
I got my gat and I'm throwing b's up
I'm throwing b's up, smoking trees up
She ain't top me, then I leave her
I'm blood gang I be throwing b's up
Them diamonds in my chain put them c's up
Seazy I throw a b's b
Blood gang pistols knock down tree tree

[Verse 1]
What I'm doing, smoking tree tree
Getting that knee knee
With a thot name Kiki, her nigga wanna be me
I’m throwing up big b’s, bullets flying like lil BB’s
Watching my chain go bling bling, this shit like lil pee pee
Almighty Sosa Big Glo, made that boss shit look easy
Say you wanna catch me though, if you walk in you won't see me
Pull up playin' repo takin' every nigga I'm seeing
What I ain't I'll never be, what I am I'm being

[Hook]
Swag, throwing b's up
I got my gat and I'm throwing b's up
I'm throwing b's up, smoking trees up
She ain't top me, then I leave her
I'm blood gang I be throwing b's up
Them diamonds in my chain put them c's up
Seazy I throw a b's b
Blood gang pistols knock down tree tree

[Verse 2]
These choppas knock down trees trees
Choppas knock down heads and knees knees and feet, feet
Shooting up fefe’s
We shootin' targets we don't shoot no teetee
I'm too turnt, bitch I'm TT
We know drama just like TNT
It's no comparin' he and me
Up this gun, shoot his ass, cause it's he or me

[Hook]
Swag, throwing b's up

I'm blood gang I be throwing b's up
Them diamonds in my chain put them c's up
Seazy I throw a b's b
Blood gang pistols knock down tree tree
