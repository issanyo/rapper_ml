[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm a motherfucking fool, cut the check
I'm a working motherfucker need a desk shit
I don't got a heart, I don't even need a chest
I'm a mess, they be saying they up next, that's a stretch
Hold your breath let me bow to the crowd, shit I'm blessed
Well I must be, bitches want to fuck me, bump uglies on front street
The cards on the table, gin rummy
Have a blast, have a ball, have a motherfucking great time
Beast, I'm a dog, got a squad full of K-9s
I'm a motherfucking fool, cut the check
I'mma get it 'til there ain't shit left to get
No stress, running suicides, don't even break a sweat
I'm a threat, code red when your line get pressed
You getting fucked by your contract what the fine print says
Told you once; I told you twice; I get the lamb; it's over rice
I whip the Lamb, it's overpriced, the life is goodâ€”the hoes are dykes
The type of shit don't happen overnight (God damn)
I'm a motherfucking fool

[Hook: Mac Miller]
This shit on 100 degrees, hard as fuck ain't in a rush
I let the money come to me, I'm a business man
I'm way too young to be this rich
I don't know what to do with all this shit
I'm out of control, Lord can you save my soul?
How convenient, you ain't worried about shit right now
How convenient, you're just tryna keep it lit right now
How convenient, screaming money over bitches right now
How convenient, bet you're feeling like the shit right now

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
How convenient, undefeated
Walked up in Neimans spent the sac then I'm leaving
Smoking on reefer, OG reeking
If the cops pull me over they gon' want to take the Bimmer
But I'mma do the dash, beat it like Tina
And I got my nina boy, you better be subpoenaed
Walked in the spot, ice on, lights on, blingin'
Someone start a fire cause it's fucking freezing
I'm high off life give me the blunt I'm a roll it
I got hot rocks I'ma let you hold it
I was posted with the hammer y'all was telling police
Now I wrestle with racks, bitch I'm Mick Foley
Shit made me go woo like Rick Florer
I mean Ric Flair bitch boy I've been player
You a bench warmer boy I've been playing
Walked up the stairs look at my shoes like them cleaner
But I should've worn the other ones cause them better

[Hook: Mac Miller]
This shit on 100 degrees, hard as fuck ain't in a rush

I'm way too young to be this rich

How convenient, you ain't worried about shit right now
How convenient, you're just tryna keep it lit right now
How convenient, screaming money over bitches right now
How convenient, bet you're feeling like the shit right now
Cut the check
