[Verse]
Niggas be like when I see Sosa I'ma treat that nigga on everything
But niggas don't be on a damn thing
Niggas ain't next to my damn chain
Smoke so many trees, wonder what my breath like
But I be shining bright like a damn light
Bitches be like he ain't shit girl, baby girl you damn bright
Cuz these thotties going any damn way
I'm like me, you can't do it any better
I'ma do this shit in any weather
And I bet I'll have your bitch following my campaign
Try me, guns be like I am 'Bang'
Cuz I got 2 shots when I'm done blowing, bang
Let me catch a nigga from the low end, bang
Let me catch a nigga from Insane
He gon' be on the (?) right along with Ben Frank

[Hook]
I'ma be that nigga forever
Forever

I'm gon' be that nigga forever, I'm gon' be that nigga forever
I'm gon' be that nigga forever, I'm gon' be that nigga forever
I'm gon' be that nigga forever
