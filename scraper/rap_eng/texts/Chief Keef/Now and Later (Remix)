[Intro]
Climbin' up big ass trees
Higher than Jack and the Bean
Bitch, now I'm back poppin' beans
And I ain't mixin' that with the Lean
She got her mind made up
(Mind made up)

[Hook]
I'm gonna hit that now and later
(I'm gonna hit that now and later)
I'm gettin' money now and later
(Now and later)
Shit ain't sweet like now and later
(Now and later)
I be ridin' round town like I'm the mayor
(I'm the mayor)
Ready to get all that paper
(Gotta get all that paper)
I be fuckin' on thots like I'm a player
(Like I'm a player)
Thots when I go to sleep and wake up
(They go to sleep and wake up)

Thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker
Thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker, heart breaker
Thot breaker, thot breaker, heart breaker, thot breaker
Heart breaker, thot breaker

[Verse 1] Chief Keef
All I know is go hard, less Tony, more Sosa
Pull up on your block like cockadoodledoo and roosta roosta
Pulled up on your thot and she like God is that you? And I don't know her
But all these bitches love Sosa
And they down to hold the toaster
Grandma saying now and later
I'm about 30 thousand dollar loafers

[Bridge]
Thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker
Thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker, heart breaker
Thot breaker, thot breaker, heart breaker, thot breaker
Heart breaker, thot breaker
Bitch I'm a heart breaker
