[Hook]
I got a hunnid in my tec
I got hunnids in my pants
Got a hunnid on my neck
And a hunnid on my hands
And a hunnid on my hands
And a hunnid on my hands
Paid a hunnid for my whip
Hunnid guns up on my strip
Let a nigga try to rob me get a hunnid hollow tips
Got shooters in the hunnids, I got some that's not from here
Got a hunnid bitches tryna suck my cock from all the way here
Got a hunnid niggas with me, that's a hunnid volunteers
Dropping hunnids hunnids hunnids, get them ones up out of here

[Verse 1]
Got a hunnid for my AK12 that's a hunnid hunnid
Rep that block with my niggas yeah, them 3Hunna monkeys
Got a hunnid in my robins, Balenciagas cost 6 hunnid
Give opposing niggas a shadow, I got some shotters on 600
30 hundreds for my bed thot came over and I fucked her
And she know that she can't trick me, she know it's me and my weapon
Me and my weapons, me and my niggas
Let 100 niggas try me I'll burn em
Put bullets on niggas like a freckle
Coming real far with a wesson
But I like that instrumental
Tryna cop me some billions
Hunnid niggas here, a hunnid niggas there
Hunnid niggas everywhere with their guns in the air
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo karma in the air
Hunnid dead bodies, hunnid damn sheriffs
Got money in my back pocket, money in my front pocket
I got hunnid in this fat rocket, I'ma let it bombard
And I be with the Simpsons, been friends with young Bart
And I got all this green with me, I look like a young tart

[Hook]
I got a hunnid in my tec
I got hunnids in my pants
Got a hunnid on my neck
And a hunnid on my hands
And a hunnid on my hands
And a hunnid on my hands
Paid a hunnid for my whip
Hunnid guns up on my strip
Let a nigga try to rob me get a hunnid hollow tips
Got shooters in the hunnids, I got some that's not from here
Got a hunnid bitches tryna suck my cock from all the way here
Got a hunnid niggas with me, that's a hunnid volunteers
Dropping hunnids hunnids hunnids, get them ones up out of here
