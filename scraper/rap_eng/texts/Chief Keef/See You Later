[Intro]
I can't trust a soul, I ride with toolie
I swear that is glued to me
In case some fuck nigga run up tryna do me
I'ma get to fucking shooting
I got a Glock that bitch hot, time to trade it
Niggas really mad cuz I done made it
And I get paper
They can't get nathin'
Cross me, bitch, see you later

[Verse 1]
That nigga cross me, he gone need God
Ride up on 4-O-6 and heat their block
But they ain't out there
We don't ever see them
Bitch, my .45 wanna meet them
But I'm rich, let me T down
Cuz I'm T'd up
Off reefer
I still feel this flat
But I just popped two Xanax
This that Xanax music
This that flat music
This that go-and-get-your-gat music
This that get-it-cracking music
This for my white boys that be going hard
Fucking thots like porn stars
Smoking on that dope
We don't smoke that fucking bubble gum or  Girl Scout Cookies
Bitch I don't want no pussy, I want top
Top me then I'll leave your car
Go back, where the fuck you came from
You know what my name was, my name is Almighty
And I'm hardbodied
I ain't scared of nobody
My gun don't fear nobody
Let it blow, my gun don't hear nobody
Or see nobody
But it will air somebody
Shoot your ear off, buddy
Meet my little friend, his name is Tommy
I don't snort coke, I don't do molly
I don't sniff dope, I don't do nothing
But smoke trees
I just get high
Get high till I damn die
Niggas hating on me, I don't know why
But you know I got my .45
Tadoe got the 4-O
Get him off a flat, Remy and Patron tho
And he at your door
Causing commotion
Knocking shit over and down
Blowing down your trees
Blowing down your kitchen, blowing down your knees
And he blowing down your feet and your top
I bet to death he will not
Where your pounds and your bucks? And your bricks?
Where your bitch?
So I can fuck her and make her tell me shit
Why? Cuz I got that good dick
She sucking on this dick
Guess what, she loving on this dick
