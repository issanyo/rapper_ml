I'm on it, I'm on it
I'm on the block and it's pumpin', it's pumpin', it's pumpin'
I'm in the kitchen, it's jumpin', it's jumpin', it's jumpin'
This kush is loud, it's tumblin', it's tumblin', it's tumblin'
This da squad, we comin', we comin', we comin'
Extra clips we dumpin', we dumpin', we dumpin'
Bitch niggas stop runnin', stop runnin', stop runnin'
Your whole hood, we stompin', we stompin', we stompin'
This da squad we comin', we comin', we comin'

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
We Brick Squad, we runnin'
In my pocket, all 100's
If it ain't about that money, everything else is nothin'
(?) in my Louis, everything else is rugby
Spent 20 bands for my ice, that's why she wanna fuck me
In my bedroom I spent the Rollex
Livin' room cost Polo bed
I'm that nigga, you know that
This .40, don't make me blow that
I throw money, hoes know that
(?) we sold that
I was doin' that shit before that
Red beams where you nose at?
Now he's callin' you Rudolph
Silencer on the gun, no shoes off
Let them pistols off, turn the news on
Bitch I'm the plug, can't put you on
Now he's callin' you Rudolph
Silencer on the gun, no shoes off
Let them pistols off, turn the news on
Bitch I'm the plug, can't put you on

[Verse 2: Richie Stackz]
My team full of them maniacs
All about that paper so there's no time to relax
Every day I'm on it, today I'm with your main ho
Truey's on my ass but, everything else is Polo
I'll go places you won't go
Just to move that coco
I do that shit on the low-low
Watchin' out for the po-po
(?) I got them things for the low-low
Everyday I stack dough, I'm blowin' on that loud dro
Typhoons that pump, 5OTs that pump
Lotta dope boys that pump
That's a lot of work I pump
Five bricks in the trunk, five goons with pumps
Five hoes that slut, I stack racks and I nut
It's jumpin', it's jumpin'
This block I'm on, it's pumpin'
I started off with nothin' nigga, I turn that shit into somethin'
Everyday I be hustlin', I triple that or I double it
I do that shit in the dark or I do that shit in the public
