[Intro]
Get this money
I do this for my daughter, I don't do this shit for nothin
It's all about the Glory and that's why I stay stunting

[Hook]
She like you told me you'd never leave me, gotta go and get this money (guap)
I do this for my daughter, I don't do this shit for nothing (Kay Kay)
It's all about the Glory and that's why I stay stunting (you know)
I got so much money I can buy a bank, huh (Ben Frank)
Is you gone give me top, she say she prolly say so (huh bitch)
When you gotta get out, bitch imma say so (yeah, bitch)
I got all this cake like it's my birthday though (that guap)
Just don't call me broke, but you can call it what you want

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Watch me come through killing shit, R.I.P. the parking lot
Imma make her give me top
Imma go and drop the top
I be counting lots of guap
I be fucking lots of thots
Say I got some awesome ears, awesome chain, awesome watch¬Å
You wearing trues, my daughter tho
Versace shit, Louis Vuitton
That bitch say help her, she say she ain't going home
Imma have to kick her out, Kay Kay you leave me alone
Boy you shouldn't be mean to me
Tell your bitch to leave me alone
I'm swaggin', I'm swaggin with my Louis rag and
Got 500 cash up in my Louis bag and
Sosa you be swagging, bitch I ain't askin'
I'm smoking on this dope, this shit smellin' like some cat piss
All these niggas mad and I'm cooling relaxing
Coolin' in my mansion with my shoota Tray Savage
And he got that MAC-10, this ain't no old western
Spot 'em, got 'em, drop 'em, shoot his ass bitch no exceptions

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I be with them snow boys
You be with them broke boys
I be smoking loud pack and you ain't making no noise
Get dough boy or you gon' die broke boy
Cause fuck with us, we gon leave you dead, nothing to show for it
I fucked your bitch, she all up on my phone now
You lookin' for her, she in Sosa world boy she gone now
But I do not like her, that little pussy fucked it
I fuck 10 hoes a day and bad bitches come in dozens
Smoking on this kush pack, strong pack, musty
I don't wanna fuck her anyway bitch you musty
Sayin' that them red bottoms bitch them red nothings
40's with the 30's and you can meet they cousin
You bitch a bug and you little niggas buggin'
I'm crazy I take $40,000 spend it like its nothing
It's nothing, with my conjunction function
And I'm posted on this black wall but I ain't from Compton
