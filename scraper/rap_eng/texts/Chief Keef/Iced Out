[Hook]
I got a band for every bump on your fuckin' face
Came to LA to dodge a fuckin' case
Before you eat say your fuckin' grace
Have lil shawty come over to bake a fuckin' cake
I got a motherfuckin' robe on right now
Buyin' out the whole mall right now
I'm a trend setter, I don't bite styles
Soon as I got my check I got iced out
Bang-bang

Buyin' out the whole mall right now
