[Hook]
I don't like lil bets, I win whole pots
I don't like lil hoes I get old thots
I like new guap and old guap
Remember letting tools pop in O-block
Ain't no more verses that shit sold out
I don't like white nigga, bring that gold out
Smoking on this green dope is so loud
I got enough Tooka for the whole crowd

[Verse 1]
Walk up in the show that shit sold out
And we walk up in the show with poles out
Let a nigga try me he get blown down
Referee whistle I am so foul
If you ain't know nigga now you know now
I'm in my BD stance, ten toes down
Life a roller coaster bitch it Glo round
Went and scooped some kicks finna go and scoop your ho now
When I hit the bank I am so proud
Just got some money in and it so loud
You smoke dirty weed that ain't no loud
Boy that pack for kids that is so child
Pull up on your bitch then take off wild
I push it to the limit I'm Rick Ross now

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got enough Tooka for the whole crowd
Who wanna smoke now, I got dope now
I got a lotta pack, lotta thrax
Lotta X, lotta flats bitch, lotta narcotics bitch
I pop a flat, and I'm in that, at your neck bitch
Catch you lacking, should of had your asses bitch
Pull up in that wolf this is not a Lex bitch
She like "ain't you Chief Keef," I'm like "Yes bitch"
Bitch nigga it's cracking
Get up off the porch no lacking
Ride up on you slide the door back, audience clapping
We take what you taxing, split it up like magic

[Hook]
