[Hook]
My glove department filled with residue
Had to shit on you cause you thought you was cool
When I pull out them hundreds boy I'm blessin' dude
I got a hundred for you, you, and you
Hop out at the gas station cause I'm a star
Full tank cause I didn't even charge my car
I let the doors go up, then your bitch get in
She sees all this money, she say, "Chief Sosa you winnin'"

[Verse 1]
I rolled up 10 joints, I got weed for days
I got all this green I swear that its my baby
I've been getting money since my senior days
But I forgot I didn't go to school I'm crazy
I put Margiela's on my fucking shoes
I poured 2 deuces nigga fuck some booze
I'm rollin' up 3 grams in the fuckin' wood
Don't worry bout me, I'm getting money I'm good
I pull up to the club and them doors go up
Motivation? No-you's only dumb fucks
Gotta use the shower, hella hundreds in the tub
The police can run in here, I don't give no fucks

[Verse 2]
I got a million un-read texts
I got a million read text messages
I only read 'em if you're talkin' benji's
Can't be talking small, gotta be talkin' plenty
I got 6 hoes in 6 different beds
Dro and Mike told me I'm the black Elvis Presley
I got hoes in 50 different states
Been all around the world, can't tell me bout a penny
Member kickin' doors and hittin' stains
I'm eatin' good, fuck your Craig Jenny
For all you dumb ass fucks, I'm talkin' Jenny Craig
Try to make me go on a diet, pussy I ain't wit it
(BANG BANG)
