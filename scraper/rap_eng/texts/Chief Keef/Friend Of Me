[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
He ain't no friend of me kill that fucking nigga like my enemy
I'm tired of this niggas being frenemies
Only thing thats killing me, my energy (Gang)
Catch a fuck nigga show him what he mean to me (Bang Bang)
And I got this MAC, it go ratat
You tote a duce duce sound like a high hat
I'm toting  on this chopper, it go grat grat
Same puss I beg for then I pay for my head
Set me up, baby girl, don't try that
I got my friend with me and that be my gat
Too much tooka pack where my life at
Bullets come out this chopper where the knife at
They say when you're rich, you can't have broke friends
I guess I just noticed that
They with you when you're rich but when they owe ends
Bet that shit be all over with
