Pull up, we some artists, bitch, we paint
With the wing in the sling, and some dope and the 'caine
And the pills and the drank and a hundred in the thing
Guns and they aim, hollows in the thing

Got some money on me,  I got my shine on
I got some hunnas on me, got some hunnas on me
I'm smokin' jumbos
When I roll up the Swishers, roll up the Swishers
I'm rollin' up Backwoods
Fill that Backwood with reefer, Backwood with reefer
Slapped off this lean, tequila, my phone be my beeper
My money be the ringer, don't call if you can't speak it
Boy you be a Tweeter, I pull up on the tweaker
I'm the Grim Reaper, demon with an Eagle

[Hook: Lil Durk]
