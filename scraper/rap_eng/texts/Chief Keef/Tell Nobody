[Intro]
Baby girl I want you, and I know you want me
It's a lot going on, so you can't be my main squeeze
You ain't gotta tell nobody, nobody
You ain't gotta tell nobody, nobody
Nobody, you ain't gotta tell nobody, nobody

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Baby girl I want you, and I know you want me
It's a lot going on, so you can't be my main squeeze
But damn baby you hit my line at three
So fuck it you know I'ma freak
You ain't gotta tell nobody, you ain't gotta tell nobody
You ain't gotta tell nobody, you ain't gotta tell nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
You ain't gotta tell nobody, nobody, nobody
Knew you was fuckin in the party, fuckin in the party, party
You ain't gotta tell nobody, nobody baby
That's me you was fuckin in the lobby, in the kitchen, and on the counter baby
Bitches in my hair, dandruff (Dandruff baby)
You don't want no smoke, don't want no cancer (You don't want no cancer baby)
Shawty wanna be wit the romantic, I ain't wit the romantic
When I walked in the room I was knocking down candles, cause I'm average
Then we was freaking loud
When I hit it hard she like "owe"
It all happened in my house
You remind me of my Jeep or my Beamer
Baby look just like my nina, baby shot me down when I seen her
Smokin on dope, countin up rolls
Asked why I love her, I told the bitch no
Only love dough, Ion love hoes
Ask me if I want her, I said maybe Fredo

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Baby girl I want you, and I know you want me
It's a lot going on, so you can't be my main squeeze
But damn baby you hit my line at three
So fuck it you know I'ma freak
Baby you ain't gotta tell nobody, you ain't gotta tell nobody
You ain't gotta tell nobody, you ain't gotta tell nobody
Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody

[Verse 2: Chief Keef & Fredo Santana]
You ain't gotta tell nobody, nobody, nobody
What's goin on, between me and you
Babygirl I fuck wit' you, but I cannot fuck wit' you
Meet me at the airport, maybe I'ma fly you 'round
Introduce you to this trap life, show you what I'm all about
Babygirl I'm bossed up, you should see my bank account
Suck me so good, I had to take her shopping and take her out
Please don't take no pics, I don't want nobody to find out
Tryna get some head, and see what your mind about
Baby girl I like you, but I might one night you
Baby girl I'm young, ain't ready, to settle down in a relationship
So don't think about it, save that shit
You already know how temptation get
I can't fuck wit' no basic bitch
Seen me in my glo, now she wanna know my name and shit

[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Baby girl I want you, and I know you want me
It's a lot going on, so you can't be my main squeeze
But damn baby you hit my line at three
So fuck it you know I'ma freak
You ain't gotta tell nobody, you ain't gotta tell nobody
You ain't gotta tell nobody, you ain't gotta tell nobody
Nobody, nobody

[Outro]
Nobody
You ain't gotta tell nobody baby
