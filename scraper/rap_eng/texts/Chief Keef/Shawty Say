[Hook]
Shawty say the nigga that she with ain't shit
Shawty say the nigga that she with ain't this
Shawty say the nigga that she with can't hit
But, shawty ima hit it
Hit it like I can't miss
[X2]

[Verse]
Shawty say the nigga that she with ain't shit
I asked if she a virgin
She said her nigga can't hit
But I don't give a fuck
Cause that ain't my bitch
I'm just tryna hit it
Hit it like I can't miss
Now I ain't gon' lie
I won't wife no bitch
I like a boutique chick
On some slim weight shit (I do!)
She asked me where the money
I said we gon' die rich
I asked her where her man
She said that nigga gone
I said gone where?
She said gone home
So I gave her my number
Told her hit my home phone
Now she callin me
She even got my ring-tone
She playin hard to get
Now I got her in a zone (I do!)
If it wasn't for me, shit
She wasn't even known
Know I gotta ask for -inaudible-
Sum like a red phone
