[Hook]
I got nothing but killas up in my squad
We shoot the gun first, then we talk to god
Early morning move the soft, later move the hard
This the life of stang city on the boulevard
On the boulevard, we be going hard
Early with the soft, later with the hard
Shoot the gun first, later talk to god
I gots to get it, gots to get it so I go hard

[Verse 1:Beece Daytona]
You can call me James Bond cus I'm on a mission
Hit my trap, big garbage bags full of taped chickens
I got my hands full of water like I'm doing dishes
I give you niggas so much cake, it's like I'm giving wishes
You say you don't care bout the town, but why you act suspicious?
You say you out here on your grind, well nigga hit me
I gots to get it, gots to get it serve it strapped with digits
One thing about me, I won't let no bullshit slip me
I ain't slipping, I'm just plotting what I'm bout to do though
I make one Call, I'll have bout 8 niggas bunched in the 2 door
Strapped with loaded Oozo's
Send this bitch off to Pluto
The way my boulevard kick, you can call it ju-do
Say you can call it ju-do
Yea you can call it ju-do
But quiet down, heard they listening, better keep it D-lo
Word around, I'm the one, like my nigga Dee-bo
Probably cus how I whip the sea or how I make the D go

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
