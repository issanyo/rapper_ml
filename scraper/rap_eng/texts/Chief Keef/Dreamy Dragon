[Verse 1]
Oh, you want me to be good for you
But you gotta be bad for me
Complete these tasks for me
Can you catch this pass for me?
And if the tires pop, would you still ride for me?
If everyone else was fake, would you still have loyalty?
I had to get the royalties, dodging them bumble bees
I gotta keep my eyes wide open
We livin' in a world of creeps
Fast car I gotta pipe down
Before I fuck around and wipe out
Here my love come right now
She's comin down in a nightgown

[Chorus]
I had to catch my breath
Jump on a boat and sa-a-ail
Feelin' like Johnny Depp, out I never will sell
You love me I can tell and I can tell more than I can feel
Sorry I didn't mean to yell, bang bang

[Post-Chorus]
I had to catch my breath
I had to catch my breath
I had to catch my breath
I had to catch my breath

[Verse 2]
Oh, you say you live by canoga
I'm gettin tipsy, I might come over
I'm gonna put my hands on you
Hands on you like my controller
And I can never sleep, that money be smelling like folgers
Pick you up in a 600, you know it smell like dope
Don't worry about how I drive
Just know that I'm a pro and I'll never get full
I'mma always want some more
And I thank God everyday that my feet make it on the floor
And if Benjamin didn't die you know he'd be callin' my phone

[Chorus]
I had to catch my breath
Jump on a boat and sa-a-ail
Feelin' like Johnny Depp, out I never will sell
You love me I can tell and I can tell more than I can feel
Sorry I didn't mean to yell, bang bang

[Post-Chorus]
I had to catch my breath
I had to catch my breath
I had to catch my breath
I had to catch my breath

[Outro]
I had to catch my breath
I had to catch my breath
I had to catch my breath
I had to catch my breath
