[Intro]
Fill a cup up, fuck a slut bitch
Fuck you talkin' 'bout nigga
You know what the fuck it is nigga
Niggas rowdy, with that ruckus
On Folks

[Hook]
I'm in that robot
And this bitch don't stop
And I got a tanktop with a knot
Prolly finna pick up your thot
Bitch I'm gang til' I ride
Tooting Glock like a fox nigga
Me and foe 'nem be getting on the 'gram
Back-to-back doing dash in the traffic
Grandma told me that I'm livin' too fast
I fill a cup up and I sip it too fast

[Verse 1: Chief Keef & Tray Savage]
[?] they dunkin' to fast
You tried to run but they coming too fast
Better fall, I got them shooters on yo ass
Then I take a flight to Cuba on yo' ass
What's up in my cup? Mud
What's up in the choppa? Slug
Swingin' bitch like Nunchaku
Send this bitch right at ya'
Sneakdiss, we can't let ya'
Running out of Pesos
Stack that shit like lego
Always act the A-hole

[Hook]
I'm in that robot
And this bitch don't stop
And I got a tanktop with a knot
Prolly finna pick up your thot
Bitch I'm gang til' I ride
Tooting Glock like a fox nigga
Me and foe 'nem be getting on the 'gram
Back-to-back doing dash in the traffic
Grandma told me that I'm livin' too fast
I fill a cup up and I sip it too fast

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Fill a cup up, fuck a slut bitch
Semi too big, I can't tuck it
Niggas rowdy, with that ruckus
I'm in the kush coma, uncoussion
I'm in [?] banned trousers
In New York smokin' sours
So much chicken, I need flavour
At the spot out in Braurer
I need space because I'm outer
That shit new but this is louder
I just exit off a garage
Foreign got that money power
Get it hoe? I'm money shower
That bitch know that world is ours
I don't care to race man, bring the prowers
[?] kicks and Gucci trousers
Imma need 'bout two-three hours
Before I come get the bag and
Hit the stain and do the magic
Hermes belt but I'm still sagging

[Hook]
I'm in that robot
And this bitch don't stop
And I got a tanktop with a knot
Prolly finna pick up your thot
Bitch I'm gang til' I ride
Tooting Glock like a fox nigga
Me and foe 'nem be getting on the 'gram
Back-to-back doing dash in the traffic
Grandma told me that I'm livin' too fast
I fill a cup up and I sip it too fast
