I say these boys ain't got no gwap
No gwap no gwap, no gwap no gwap
No gwap, I say these boys ain't got no gwap

Ay girl, bitch a pornstar, she like them foreign thangs
She like me, I'ma foreign thang
No, she like me cause I'm in foreign thangs
Foreign cars, foreign watch, foreign chains
Versace shining, it's all gold mane
You ain't getting cheese boy, that's nachos mane
Rollie on inside gold mane
You wear your homies clothes, boy, that's not yours mane

I say these boys ain't got no gwap
No gwap no gwap, no gwap no gwap
No gwap, I say these boys ain't got no gwap
