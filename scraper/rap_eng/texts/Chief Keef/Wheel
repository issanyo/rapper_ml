[Intro]
She wanna ride me like my wheels
She wanna ride me in the hills
She wanna ride me cuz I'm a star
She wanna ride me cuz [?]

[Hook]
I'm rollin' hard like I'm a ferris wheel
Me and Sosa racing Raris, Beverly Hills
I don't want the pint if it ain't sealed
I don't want the car if ain't got no wheels
I don't want the bitch if she ain't got no heels
I don't want the house if it ain't in the hills
I don't want the weed if it ain't got no smell
The car parked by itself, i took my hand off the wheel

[Verse 1]
She wanna ride me cuz i'm a star
She said she want to suck me in the car
I'm smokin' weed and I don't do bars
I'm infatuated with new cars
I'm a glory boy, trap star
I'm not just a rich rap star
Got long money, drive fast cars
Pull up they like the wheels on the car
In my condo eatin' like a boss
At the top floor but it look like a lock
When I hit the parking lot its a kill
When we pull and they rep its a drill

[Hook]
I'm rollin' hard like I'm a ferris wheel
Me and Sosa racing Raris, Beverly Hills
I don't want the pint if it ain't sealed
I don't want the car if ain't got no wheels
I don't want the bitch if she ain't got no heels
I don't want the house if it ain't in the hills
I don't want the weed if it ain't got no smell
The car parked by itself, i took my hand off the wheel

[Verse 2]
I don't want to smoke if it ain't the dope
That ain't no tooka if it ain't a choke
I don't ride waves if it ain't a boat
I don't wanna hit her that bitch ain't the store
I don't wanna taste it if it ain't a cup
I'm the cashier let me ring you up
You know i got that green mill, walkin' bus
I think it's time to bring ball out the cut
Nigga ooh you just stepped on my shoes
Gas pedal when he steppin' on you
I remember when we use to dip out the scoob
Look at us now how we dip out the coupes

[Hook]
I'm rollin' hard like I'm a ferris wheel
Me and Sosa racing Raris, Beverly Hills
I don't want the pint if it ain't sealed
I don't want the car if ain't got no wheels
I don't want the bitch if she ain't got no heels
I don't want the house if it ain't in the hills
I don't want the weed if it ain't got no smell
The car parked by itself, i took my hand off the wheel

[Outro]
She wanna ride me like my wheels
She wanna ride me in the hills
She wanna ride me cuz I'm a star
She wanna ride me cuz [?]
