[Hook]
All a young nigga know is finesse
Before you come to me, you better get a check
Ride down Normal road, roll down windows flex
Hopped out on 'em looking like a check
$6,000 backpack with some Louis boots
All he do is talk, all we do is shoot
All I do is pull out racks
All I do is fucking ball
All I do is pop tags
All I do is fuck the mall

[Verse 1]
All I do is hit Neiman’s
All I do is hit Barney's
All I do is hit Gucci
All I do is get money
All I do is hit Herman's
All I do is hit Louis
All I do it hit Burberry
All I do is get Jewelry
All I do is call my Jeweler
Have him pee on my neck
Your girlfriend just text me like when are we having sex?
Baby and can fuck you the week after next
When I’m done I’ll need something to eat after that
These niggas hate me, I give zero fucks
I’m in a Rolls Royce, I’m doing donuts
He wants to spray me, she wants to rape me
She's looking sneaky, he's looking flaky

[Verse 2]
She just got here and she like how I drive my fucking car
You have a ass and I saw that from a fucking far
She like for real, that’s all?
I’m like girl you fucking smart
When I hit the finish line, throw you back into the start
When you done eating my pickle, throw it back up in the jar
Bitch I’m balling Scottie Pippen, Michael Jordan, Dennis Rodman
And I get high like I’m growing weed in my garden
I ain’t going nowhere, I’m going to finish what I started
You can walk a thousand miles in my Louis boots
Don’t wanna have to do the drill so I’m screwing loose
Had your girl down there that’s why my Louis belt was open
Boy your diamonds blurry, let me turn up my focus

[Outro]
You can walk a thousand miles in my Louis boots
I ain’t going nowhere, I’m going to finish what I started
