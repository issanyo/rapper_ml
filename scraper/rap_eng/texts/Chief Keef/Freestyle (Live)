[Verse1: Chief Keef]
Put that on my daughter OTF til the grave, gun play
Runnin from me and shots broad day, yâ€™all fake
Better wake up smelling coffee, wale
Down to the ground shot on face
Stacking lace, better play your cards right. Playin' spades
See you niggas is some slaves and my gun be the case
And someday, I mean one day Imma be at the Grammy's trying to fuck Beyonce
On the leg, get your bitch, she on me, steady rubbing on my dick, she gon' get me horny
And hooray, I'm screaming hooray for these niggas, catch outside, I've been gone all day
First day out, Imma smoke a lung away, Imma pop a flat pill, move like a zombie, bitch
