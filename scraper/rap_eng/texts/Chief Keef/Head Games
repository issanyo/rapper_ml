[Verse]
I swear the way she kissed me
On my lips it must of opened up my soul
Im Glad she ain't Medusa, when she kissed me would of turned me into stone
I need you everyday, i swear to god, you gunna need a clone
You touch me
You give me chills i feel it in my bones
You hear me out, I wanna turn around, its like..

[Hook]
Why you gotta play these, why why
Why you gotta play these head games baby?
Why you gotta play these, why, why you gotta play these head games with me?
Why you gotta play these, why why, why you gotta play these head games?

[Verse]
I swear the way i felt
I wouldn't change it and i traded it for time..
You'd go up all my things, put it on you girl, I'd make your body shine
Every single noise you make its pretty girl your sounding like a charm..
We be the stars, when were together, perfectly aligned
But when i turn around your gone
When i turn around your gone

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Whats thats in your cup girl?
Why dont you slow down...
I know your tryna move up girl, but hes not in the home now
I feel it
Oh yeah i feel it. Oh yeah i feel ya
Do ya' kill it?
Oh yeah you kill it, hands to the ceiling
Move that body, girl move that feeling, girl move that feeling
Im all up, im all on that, but you dont see it baby

[Hook]
Why you gotta play these,(gotta slow it down) why why
You gotta play these head games baby?
(got 'em moving around, got 'em moving around, got 'em moving around.)
Why you gotta play these, why why, (girl im all on that, but you dont see it baby.)
Why you gotta play these head games with me?
Why you gotta play these, why why
Why you gotta play these head games?
