All these foreigns, all these foreigns

Foreigns, foreigns, foreigns

All these foreigns
Take a look outside my house, tell me what you see
Foreigns (x9)
All these foreigns, all these foreigns
All these foreigns, all these...

[Hook]
All these foreigns (x16)
All these
Foreigns (x9)
Take a look outside my house, tell me what you see
Foreigns (x9)
Bitch I'm riding in the house, it ain't nothing to me
Foreigns, foreigns

[Verse 1]
When I pull off in my foreign, that bitch sound like a thunderstorm
All this ice it got me cold bitch, like where my undergarments
I'm smoking earth, I think it's foreign, this shit smell like underarms
That bitch ain't wanna give me top, I fired that bitch now that bitch unemployed
I can have anything I want in this world, from a Bugatti to a Rolls-Royce
Now I'm finna buy a Maybach, ain't have to say that, but I'm shitting on you lil boys
All these foreigns I need 'fore Rehab, so for foreigns I got a warrant
And cause I got all these foreigns, I got all these thotties going
She say she miss chinese, but he think his thottie foreign
I'm riding smoking on weed, call me Sosa Molly Foreign
That bitch a hooptie but she think she Ferrari foreign
She only wanna fuck me cause my foreign, but boy I'm on St. Lawrence
Mercedes and Beamers, Ferraris, Bugattis
Lambos and Lotuses, Bentleys, Maybachs please
Ride Nissans and steamers but God came and got me
Only thing I got american made is two SRT's
For all these foreigns, foreigns, foreigns, foreigns, foreigns, foreigns, foreigns, foreigns, foreigns
That bitch can't come to my house, meet me at the DoubleTree
And I'll be blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing, blowing
If that bitch come to the DoubleTree, tryna set up me
Cause I need ten foreigns instead of three
I got all these foreign bitches but they scared of me
But ain't nothing to regret with me
Send my niggas on St. Lawrence, Lawrence, Lawrence, Lawrence, Lawrence, Lawrence, Lawrence out a foreign
It's just them, thirty shots, BD company
Going, going, going, going, going, going, going, got a boy
I gave them some foreign guns, and some foreign weed
