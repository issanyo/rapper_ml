[Hook]
I got Louie, I got Gucci
I got bitches give me coochie
I wear Louie and Gucci bitch
Call that shit that Gooey
I wear Hermes wear Burberry
And my Trueys hold my toolie
My Louie hold my cash and my Gucci hold my jewelry

[Verse]
When I'm traveling my Gucci hold my clothes
When I'm traveling my Louie hold my clothes
And my pants hold my rolls
I gotta take off my damn shoes cause I ain't got no jet yet bitch
Still making niggas upset bitch
Come through we shooting at your neck and shit bitch
Like I thought you was with the shit bitch
They steady asking why I don't go to the awards
Cause I can't go to the awards with my damn pole or my bros
Cause they gone act a fool
Taking chains niggas act up then
Boom-Boom BANG BANG!
Money be the color of my veins nigga
Gold the color of my chains nigga
Yellow diamonds white diamonds
Bling bling nigga Bling bling nigga
