I just poured a 4 of that purple stuff (that lean, that lean)
Swear this shit is purple as fuck (damn, damn)
Remind me of that Barney shit (haha)
Shout out 300 bitch, we blamming shit (bang, bang)
That's the squad that I ride for (squad)
That's the squad that you die from
Bitch I'm from the O (O'Block)
I do this shit with my eyes closed
You ride Challengers, I can't ride those (damn)
You ride Jaguars, I can't ride those (what we do?)
Bitch rolled a 3.5, I can't light those (hell no)
I just smoked a QP, got my eyes closed (I can't even move)
They see them foreign cars pulling up (Beamer Gang, bitch)
And now they on that looking stuff (damn)
Always tryna see who I'm rolling with (Glory Gang, bitch)
Just so they can saw

[Hook:]
I smoked too many blunts, this shit got me stuck
Don't want war with us, bitch we damage ya

Boy get your bands up, boy get your bands up
Boy get your bands up, boy get your bands up
