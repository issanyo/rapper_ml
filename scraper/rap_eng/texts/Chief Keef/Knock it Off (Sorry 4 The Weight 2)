[Chorus]
I had a .30 in my Hollister
Now I go in Gucci and I cop it all
Get out the way if you're not involved
Do me a favor, knock it off
Bang, bang, bang

[Verse 1]
Don't approch me if it ain't 'bout money
Boy you know how I'm comin'
No, I cannot pull up
She say I'm actin' funny
I hop out, get bags of money
Rock out like Led Zep-pelin
Thot like, "What you up to?" Nothin'
She let me fuck this mornin'
Went and picked up a bag
These niggas is stealin' swag
I cannot fuck with you
If you don't fuck with gang
Roll up and blow your brain
Roll up, it's to the brain
Your life spent on my chain
She unbutton these Balmains
It's 300, them guys with me
We 'bout it, no Master P
Smokin' this celery
Countin' a salary
You did not ride with me
'Cause you were doubtin' me
You could've had your name on a Big Falcon tee

[Chorus]
I had a .30 in my Hollister
Now I go in Gucci and I cop it all
Get out the way if you're not involved
Do me a favor, knock it off
Bang, bang, bang

[Verse 1]
Don't approch me if it ain't 'bout money
Boy you know how I'm comin'
No, I cannot pull up
She say I'm actin' funny
I hop out, get bags of money
Rock out like Led Zep-pelin
Thot like, "What you up to?" Nothin'
She let me fuck this mornin'
Went and picked up a bag
These niggas is stealin' swag
I cannot fuck with you
If you don't fuck with gang
Roll up and blow your brain
Roll up, it's to the brain
Your life spent on my chain
She unbutton these Balmains
It's 300, them guys with me
We 'bout it, no Master P
Smokin' this celery
Countin' a salary
You did not ride with me
'Cause you were doubtin' me
You could've had your name on a Big Falcon tee
[Pre-Chorus]
I'm swervin', I'm not suburban
We ain't worried, yeah, we searchin'
Don't get nervous, eat this bird shit
We at it early, mac burnin'

[Chorus]
I had a .30 in my Hollister
Now I go in Gucci and I cop it all
Get out the way if you're not involved
Do me a favor, knock it off
Bang, bang, bang
