Bang
Hit the mall and I ball (swish, swish)
Remember when I ain't had nothing at all (nah, nah, nah)
I remember nothing at all (nah, nah, nah)
Had them [?] stuffed in my draws (damn, damn)
Bad bitch in my missed calls (damn, damn)
Foreigns in my front (skrt, skrt, skskskrt)
Give strippers a lot of ones (beep, beep)
I love them hundreds (beep)
Aye, aye
Aye
I only fuck with my money machine (machine)
Cause it don't say nothing but beep (nothing but beep)
And I made my gun speak
Go bang bang
My gun tote a hundred
In my pocket, hundreds
My car cost a hundred, thou
Smoking on this ganja, wow
We got extensions on the room
I got my bitches in the room
Getting freaky in the room
Guns go click clack, bang that bitch
Boy, we be in that bitch
Let a bitch try to set me up, I'm gon' bring that bitch
Aye, and get away with it
That bitch should've known I don't play that shit
Remember I used to be taken and shit
Now I can spend thirty on the chains and shit
Nigga, who you banging with?
Almighty still on that same damn shit
Almighty still on that same damn shit
