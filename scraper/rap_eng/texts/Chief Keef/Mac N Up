[Hook]
I up 100s on niggas wit 50s
I get 20s from niggas wit pennies
I give nothing to these hoes nigga
Nah bitch can't get a penny (hell nah)
Glo guns comin' down your chimney (Glo)
And my cars whip this fuckin' semi, a massacre
Blow the boss if he fuckin' wit me, I'm captain duck 'em
Niggas talkin' and fuckin' wit me, I'm Mac N' Up

[Verse 1]
Nigga I ain't actin' up, I'm Mac N' Up
Macaroni time, I can duck
We just came through in the blackest truck
I seen the car, passin' 100 down the hunt
Walkin' round your block, I hunt and round you up
Dominos, ground you up you down get us
Niggas think [?]
As long as gettin' money they was on the assets
Give a lot of 100s to fortunate less
Pound of drugs on me so I'm so possessed
I been in here floatin' we ain't soap his bitch
And if he act up, I'm soap his bitch

[Hook]
I up 100s on niggas wit 50s
I get 20s from niggas wit pennies
I give nothing to these hoes nigga
Nah bitch can't get a penny (hell nah)
Glo guns comin' down your chimney (Glo)
And my cars whip this fuckin' semi, a massacre
Blow the boss if he fuckin' wit me, I'm captain duck 'em
Niggas talkin' and fuckin' wit me, I'm Mac N' Up

[Verse 2]
Certified bang, niggas actin' like they certified gangstas
Nigga you a certified wangster, nigga I'm a certified banger
You'd be in danger, catch you in traffic
You'll be a lamer
Should've been getting paper paper
I'm grindin' on your paper like a skater
I'm gettin' money day and night, bout to light
Poltergeist, pull up on you park it right
Hop out, pull a pistol, spark it right
Always tight, money you won't talk about it

[Hook]
I up 100s on niggas wit 50s
I get 20s from niggas wit pennies
I give nothing to these hoes nigga
Nah bitch can't get a penny (hell nah)
Glo guns comin' down your chimney (Glo)
And my cars whip this fuckin' semi, a massacre
Blow the boss if he fuckin' wit me, I'm captain duck 'em
Niggas talkin' and fuckin' wit me, I'm Mac N' Up
