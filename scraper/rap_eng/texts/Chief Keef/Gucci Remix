Double G on my belt buckle, don't you know that's Gucci
Own niggas sneak dissing, hating, but it's Gucci
Me and her chilling, riding, smoking, in a two seat
My car got no doors, and two seats
Double G on my belt buckle, don't you know that's Gucci
Own Niggas sneak dissing, hating, but it's Gucci
Me and her chilling, riding, smoking, in a two seat
My car got no doors, and two seats

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
My buckle is a beauty, it's a cutie, it's a Louis
Shawty say she wanna do me because I got on Louis
Smoking Dope 'til I'm woozy
My life a movie
Met me a little cutie, a-and she got a booty
She grinding all on me, she all on my Gucci
On my face Gucci, on the waist Gucci
I got it tatted on me, that means I'm Gucci
Don't fuck with fake Gucci, don't fuck with fake Louis
Me and my bitch Gs, made in Italy
Own niggas sneak dissing, called that frienemies
Me and my bitch Gs, made in Italy
We be spending Gs, green long like centipedes, geesh

Double G on my belt buckle, don't you know that's Gucci
Own niggas sneak dissing, hating, but it's Gucci
Me and her chilling, riding, smoking, in a two seat

Double G on my belt buckle, don't you know that's Gucci
Own Niggas sneak dissing, hating, but it's Gucci
Me and her chilling, riding, smoking, in a two seat
My car got no doors, and two seats

[Verse 2: Edai]
Got on Gucci, Louis, Truie
All the bitches wanna do me
She got on Truie
Bad bitch and she bugie
I told the bitch to chew me
She said she don't like the new me, and I don't like the new her
But we both love double g
We can shop and buy double g
I can tell she in love with g's, that's why she's in love with me
She in love with me, cause I be spending g's
I be spending racks, I got plenty cheese
She can't get enough of me, Edai I'm a triple g
Popping pills off triple c's, throwing up the b's
You call a girl, I represent BaldyWorld
I said you call a girl, I represent BaldyWorld
