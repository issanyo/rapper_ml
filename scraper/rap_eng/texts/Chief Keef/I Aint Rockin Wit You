[Hook:]
I got a lot of hitters
I only rock with killers
And if ain't letting pistols pop
Then I ain't rocking with you
I'm L's ass nigga
Glory Boys be my agenda
And if you ain't letting pistols pop
Then I ain't rocking with you, nigga
I ain't rocking with you
I can't be rocking with you, boy
You ain't letting pistols pop
So I ain't rocking with you, nigga
I ain't rocking with you
I can't be rocking with you, boy
You ain't letting pistols pop
So I ain't rocking with you


[Verse 1:]
I can't be rocking with you
I only rock with killers
You say you letting' pistols pop
But boy[?]
3hunna ass nigga, L's up ass nigga
And I ain't rocking with you
I leave your ass missing
I'm boss man kind, I got a lot of hoes
I save money like a bitch
Cause this money come and goes
Bitch I'm in the field
This shit is for real
You can get your ass killed
Talking about all you do you kill
I gotta see a mill
At least before I'll be killed
All I know about is smoking drugs
And then popping pills
This money so high
With the L's in the sky
Drop a "L" in tookavile
Screaming "Fuck the other side!"

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
That bitch ain't rocking with us

You sucked on my dick
Can't be thinking I'm miss you
I'm wild ass nigga, OTF we the team
And if you ain't with the team

The clip super long, we be shooting for months
Roll up the dope, we live few blunts

Fucking hoes is the thing
Shooting niggas in the brain
These niggas lames, they loud on many things
Bitch I got a lot of fans
And I got a lot of flames

[Hook]
