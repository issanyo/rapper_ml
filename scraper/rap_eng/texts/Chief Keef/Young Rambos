Let a bitch try to play me like GTA
And she'll be on her way
Could've had cake all over her face
'Cause I get it like it's my birthday

And she'll be on her way
Could've had cake all over her face
'Cause I get it like it's my birthday
Let a bitch try to play me like GTA
And she'll be on her way
Could've had cake all over her face
'Cause I get it like it's my birthday
Let a bitch try to play me like GTA
And she'll be on her way
Could've had cake all over her face
'Cause I get it like it's my birthday

[Bridge]
Let a nigga try to play me like he want war
And he gon' be a dumb boy
And he gon' meet my young boys
Coming through like young Rambos
