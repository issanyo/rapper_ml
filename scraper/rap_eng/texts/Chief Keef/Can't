But your dirty ass can't
You thought you was hitting my blunt, but your dirty ass can't
You thought you was hitting my blunt, but your dirty ass can't
Hitting my blunt, but your dirty ass can't (hit)

You thought you was hitting my blunt, but your dirty ass can't
My Beamer too fast for your Jag, mane
This ain't no YMCMB, I keep that Mac, mane
And I keep some shooters, snatch you out your damn chain
Boy, don't make me go call me a loud thing
I gotta scope myself, don't need a damn thang
Ain't had shit, that shit, now I got everything
And when it comes to my thangs, bitch, I buy everything
