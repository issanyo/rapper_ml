[Hook]
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me
She love me, she love me not (she love me)
But she know, she know that she love me
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me
She love me, she love me, she love me, she love me
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me

[Verse 1]
She love me cause I got a sack
I be spending racks
Walk in the mall I buy, fuck a tag
She love me, she love me, she love me, I know that bitch dead
She say she love my swag
How I be swagging, my swag is in my bag
And my bag cost bands, it's Louie
(And I got bands in these Trueys)
It's a Glo, fuck a movie
(Fuck your show, bitch we shooting)
And I'm with yo boo thang
She told me "will you hang?"
She love me, she love me not
She love me, she love me not
I'm still getting that guap, I don't even give no fuck
She love me, she love me not
But I'm smoking on this pot, and I'm hot

[Hook] (x2)
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me
She love me, she love me not (she love me)
But she know, she know that she love me
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me
She love me, she love me, she love me, she love me
She love me, she don't but she know that she love me
