[Hook]
This bitch gave me top, already
I'm bout to spend this guap
I'm bout to send some shots
I think I seen a opp
I think I seen the cops
Played that shit already
Smoke straight for breakfast
Flexin' get justice
Cops tryna Breathalyze
But they know I'm high

[Verse 1]
Already fat, too much food in my belly
It's already got one, I seen it, I get it
She already askin' me one hundred  and one questions
She already gave me top, I'm gone, no second guessin'
They already gave me guap, I ain't goin' back flat man
They already gave me love, I ain't goin' for less man
I already sprayed me Glock, I ain't gettin finessed man
I already played these cops, they ain't finding my weapons
Already, already, they call ready, already
She gon' give me top, guess what, my balls ready
Already, and I got a ball so yes I'm ball ready
Already, I'm ball til I fall, I guess I'm fall ready
Already

[Hook]
