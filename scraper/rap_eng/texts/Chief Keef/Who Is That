[Hook]
Boy my fucking watch cost a brick
And my favorite car, the S6
Stop the fucking flexing boy you not with the shits
Point this pistol at his stomach , blow it nigga shit
Once we start taking streets, we start locking these shits
We popping shells, same size as Budweiser 6
Got some money still tote choppas and shit
Knock knock at my door, I'm at the peep hole like who is that?

[Verse 1 ]
What you need a fucking six pack?
Knocking on my door, is you with the damn feds?
What you need a fucking 10 pack?
Give me a hundred, pussy you can get that
You say fuck Glo out your mouth we push your fucking wig back
We got pistols in the club, fuck security we slid that
I flow so hard, it made bullet proof shit crack
I’m Snoop Dizzle I’m the motherfucking shiznat
Im rolling in that Koenigsegg, the car that
All these hoes wanna give a kiss

You smoking on that shit pack
And it smell like you just got done taking a shit
Imma customize a SIG MAC

Knock knock at my door, I'm at the peep hole like who is that?

[Verse 2]
Pull off coming back, turn you into a running back
Pull up in New Jersey, Mapes and Bergen nigga, slump yo ass
Im off the Henny, and the Pepsis, Xanax, and the Thrax
In the flesh, pull up leave a nigga flat
Leave a nigga on his back, he should've fucking had his backup
Bullets gave him a disease, now this pussy need a fucking checkup
Bullets gave his ass the hiccups, you want war nigga get up
I’m an artist I paint pictures nigga, I bang nigga
