[Intro]
Say she like my car
Seen me with the stars
Un un
Buck buck
Huh
Phew, Bang
With the stars, now she wanna now me now

[Hook]
She say she like my car, she like how my Forgis ride
She seen me with the stars, now she wanna know me now
Un un, bitch I told you now I'm acting phony now
Buck buck for these niggas, think it's macaroni time
Couple bucks for these bitches, let me slap them on they ass
Tough luck for these niggas, think they next I'm on they ass
So what? Walk in court smelling like pack, I got them bands
Glo boys, that's what Almighty Sosa got them saying

[Verse 1]
I'm cooling around Japan
Or I'm cooling in Benihanas, man
Eating macaroni, man
Cause I'm allergic to lobsters, man
I got macaroni cheese
Macaroni tote fifty
Let a nigga say he want the beef
Got loony niggas with me, give 'em Macs, they blow for me
Coolin' overseas, smoking trees
My niggas in the streets, smoking G's
I don't know anything, you po-police
But this weed and this dirty Sprite on me
That bitch got a ass, she eat a lot of bread and macaroni
When she threw it back I was like holy matrimony
Cooling with the owner of the club, baby girl I got my 40 and
Pull up in the macaroni Beamer on macaroni rims, rim
I swear I'm ballin like Kobe, I am
High off this earth, you know I am
Get the MAC out the back of this all black truck and go macaroni, I am
These niggas ain't going loony, I am
Tell the cash giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, treat it like a little pony, I am
Kay Kay like it so buy a lot of macaroni, I am
Flexing on my opponents, I am
Eating all this macaroni in here

[Hook]
She say she like my car, she like how my Forgis ride
She seen me with the stars, now she wanna know me now
Un un, bitch I told you now I'm acting phony now
Buck buck for these niggas, think it's macaroni time
Couple bucks for these bitches, let me slap them on they ass
Tough luck for these niggas, think they next I'm on they ass
So what? Walk in court smelling like pack, I got them bands
Glo boys, that's what Almighty Sosa got them saying
