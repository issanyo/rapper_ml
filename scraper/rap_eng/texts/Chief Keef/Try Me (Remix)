[Hook]
Let a nigga try me, try me
I'm a get his whole mothafuckin' family
And I ain't playin wit nobody
Fuck around and I'm a catch a body
[x2]

[Verse: Chief Keef]
These bitches love Sosa
And they love them Glo' Boys
Know we from the 'Go boy
But we cannot go boy
No I don't know ol' boy
I know he's a broke boy
Raris and Rovers
Convertibles, Lambos boy
You know I got bands boy
And it's in my pants boy
Disrespect them O Boys
You won't speak again boy
Don't think that I'm playin boy
No we don't use hands boy
No we don't do friends boy
Collect bands I'm a land lord
I gets lotsa commas
I can fuck yo mama
I ain't with the drama
You can meet my llama

[Hook]
