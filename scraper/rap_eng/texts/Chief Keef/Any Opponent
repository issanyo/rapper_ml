[Hook]
She's a very thot bitch, I saw her on the corner
That ain't my bitch, I just wanna fuck her momma
Xbox shit, I'm the only one
That's my shit, every time they cut me on
Came in the trap on the floor goes the money
That's a loud pack and I put a lighter on it
How my doors flap I be thinking I'm a hornet
Where he at I'm gon' have to kill my opponent

[Verse 1]
You said I ain't getting money, what you talking about?
I remember I used to live in my mom's house
Now I'm living large got a nice house
And the mansion man, I had to get the mice out
Tell her, "Baby girl who told you bring my pipe out?"
This bitch tripping because I cut the lights out
She cooking chickens in my shit got the rice out
35 for a show tell 'em right now
Went up in the club have my ice out
I'm blinging and they got the fucking lights out
Call Desperado for the chrome, he put the auto to your dome
Call Capper for a cappe he like right now
I'm like right now? This nigga got his ice out
Me and Jusglo riding strong
Yeah I have you waiting 30 hours long

[Hook]
She's a very dark bitch, I saw her on the corner
That ain't my bitch, I just wanna fuck her momma
Xbox shit, I'm the only one
That's my shit, every time they cut me on
Came in the trap on the floor goes the money
That's a loud pack and I put a lighter on it
How my doors flap I be thinking I'm a hornet
Where he at I'm gon' have to kill my opponent

[Verse 2]
You got a very freaky momma
We can do a slumber
She asked for my number
Gave her the Jack Lumber
Rolling in that uh-huh they like there go Obama
Rolling of that um-hum bitch I can't even mumble
This bitch tripping off of nothing, told that bitch stumble
Imma get this money you'll see how the cookie crumble
Go and fall bitch I won't be there to catch you
Go and sneeze there bitch I ain't gon' be there to bless you
20 grand my i8 can beat your Tesla
Foreign king ready, I'm like i just have to test it
Bitch so what it looks like I'm riding in the flexer
I saw that motherfucker and I'm like I gotta get 'em

[Hook]
She's a very dark bitch, I saw her on the corner
That ain't my bitch, I just wanna fuck her momma
Xbox shit, I'm the only one
That's my shit, every time they cut me on
Came in the trap on the floor goes the money
That's a loud pack and I put a lighter on it
How my doors flap I be thinking I'm a hornet
Where he at I'm gon' have to kill my opponent
