[Hook: Chief Keef]
Wait wait, told that bitch

Wait wait, bitch I'm finna scoop you

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Told her meet me at the hotel and wait
Give me a second baby, I'm going to get this cake
So baby can you wait, if you can't then skate, bitch
Cause I can't wait, I can't wait, bitch
For a bitch that's trying to play me

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
W-A-I-T wait

I'm waiting for the shit, for the shit
I'm pacing for the shit, for the shit
Racks up in my pants then I spend it
Also in my pants is the slammer
Up this bitch, it slam 'em
Up this bitch, it blam 'em
I shoot 'em with the hammer
He don't even get shot by a hammer

Let's go hit the safe
That bitch told me wait, told me wait
I told that bitch to get up out my face

[Hook]
