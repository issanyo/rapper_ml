[Hook]
I just pulled up in that old color of glue
I just spend 20 on a chains , thousands on some shoes
I done fuck every bitch you wanted to
They don't fuck with you cause I dont fuck with you
They like Chief Sosa, "When we gone hit the stu?"
I'm like when you put the O on side the two
They like Sosa and I got ya album too
If I was you, bitch, I will buy two

[Verse 1]
They like Sosa you so mean to me
You don't know what you mean to me
Ever since you came in the game
You been fucking up the scenery
I know I feel like John Cena
Ain't no nigga seeing me
Tryna rob me they meet my damn Nina
Ain't a nigga getting a thing from me
Had to put that bitch out
She was doing some things to me
She ain't wanna shake her ass
She wanted to sing for me
Tryna blow nigga oh no
Cause I brought my thing with me
I feel like G.I Joe tho
I come from the meanest streets
Almighty Sosa from the O
That what it mean to me
Balling with no basketball
Got a basketball in my beamer seats
Popping shit like vegetable oil
You popping shit like season wheat
I take the moment to thank the lord
But I pop some shit I'm my meeting greet
Cause I got all this Johnny Dang on
And I got all this damn bread on
You ain't taking shit
You can take one to the head, hom'
Now I got all this damn red on

[Verse 2]
Chief Sosa shiting on you lames man
She like I know I follow you on instagram
She give me nose like she toucan Sam
Smoking on this dope and I'm coughing like damn
Bitch stop acting dumb you know who I am
I be balling hard and flexing no jams
And if you want a verse send my check in the mail
You niggas ain't gone shoot man you niggas gone tell
Get yo ass smoke if you dropping the L
They like hold up chief so I be bopping the L
Get yo ass smoke if you dropping the L
They like hold up chief so I be bopping the L
