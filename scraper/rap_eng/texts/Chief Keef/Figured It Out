[Hook]
I got big bank rolls, they know
The feds on your ass, lay low
I'm out poppin' tags in Barbasso
This life was heaven sent with a halo
I wrap my blunt in wax
Seal those Bs with plastic
Fill my jeans with racks
Don't hate on me you faggot
Smoke loud fuck bitches, counting money, living in a big house
And they hate me, I just figured out
