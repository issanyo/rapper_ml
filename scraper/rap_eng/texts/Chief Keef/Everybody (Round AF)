[Hook]
I'm high off this earth, bitch I'm high as fuck
Got this 50 on me and it's round as fuck
Had to get a new number, now I'm dry as fuck
But I don't need no bitch, I got lots of stuff
My niggas gorillas, bitch, they animals
Got lot of ammo for niggas with animals
Send shots like Rambo, come through, we end the party
My niggas don't give a fuck, send shots at everybody

[Verse 1]
Can't hit my weed, bitch, I brought something for everybody
I got fifty, bitch, I got shots for everybody
I'm off these trees, bitch, and I'm higher than everybody
After you give me knee, bitch, give some to everybody
I got this nickel on me
Blow this bitch inside like shotty
I got my pistol on me
And I wish a nigga tried me, aye
And that goes for everybody
I'm blowing at everybody
You wifing that bitch, she going for everybody
I'm at the top 'cause I don't do it like anybody
Loud hit so hard I need some antibiotics
And some lean to chase it, I might end up dying
I'm eating too good, I don't wanna diet
And I think I'm better than everybody

[Hook]
I'm high off this earth, bitch I'm high as fuck
Got this 50 on me and it's round as fuck
Had to get a new number, now I'm dry as fuck
But I don't need no bitch, I got lots of stuff
My niggas gorillas, bitch, they animals
Got lot of ammo for niggas with animals
Send shots like Rambo, come through, we end the party
My niggas don't give a fuck, send shots at everybody
