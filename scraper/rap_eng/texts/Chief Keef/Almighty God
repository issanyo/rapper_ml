[Hook]
Somebody just killed somebody, aye my name is Almighty (2 x)
My soldier just killed somebody, yeah my name is Almighty
I don't fear nobody, my name is Almighty

[Chief Keef]

I'm smoking kush, taking breath
See a nigga in my lane I'll take his breath
I'll take his life and I'll take his wife
I'm Almighty, bitch Gloin' breaking lights
You want war, in this war somebody gon' die
No time for detours I'm taking flights
I'm Almighty, Almighty
I just bought a gun and it's Long Body
Hog Body hit ya in ya heart and body
Off a flat I'ma catch a homicide
Too much stress I might catch a heart attack
Defense, I'ma catch the Quarter Back

[Hook]
