Let's get it

[Verse 1: Fredo]
45 I got that, 30 clip that's in that
Them problems? Don't want that
Trust me we on that, pop a pill I'm on that
She a bad bitch I hit that, I smash that and quit that
You know I'm getting that I'm getting that I'm getting that
300 I'm with that, fuck all that chit chat
Ain't got time get kidnapped, all you hear is "click clack"
Them bangers blow, you get whacked
Them hollow tips you feel that, you feel that, you feel that
Money talk I hear that, street shit I live that
You ain't did what I did, I'm in the shit, I'm in the shit
I'm off the shit, let off the clip
Shoot with the shit, then off the bitch
She rocking wrong not how I'm rocking with
Got bad bitches come see me
Bang Bang like Chief Keef, R.I.P to Odee
R.I.P to Big Lean, got big techs got big macs
Got big 30's with big beams, trust me you don't want that
Got big guns we on that, we on that we on that

(Hook: Fredo Santana x2)
Off a pill I'm on that, sipping lean I'm on that
Smoking loud I'm on that, getting money I'm on that
Fucking hoes I'm on that, shooting niggas I'm on that
I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that, I'm on that

(Verse 2: Chief Keef)
I'm on that, we on that, now bullets flying past yo' head
For that money I'm holding, don't care about it I throw that
Kush yeah I smoke that and God damn I'm choking
I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling, I'm rolling
Rob you you holding, for my niggas I'm blowing
Give me the gun I'll blow then, shoot you, you, and yo mans
So much soda and coke man, I'm into coke then soda man
Big guns flip yo bro man & duck clips; it's so expand
I send niggas to do hits, have yo bitch sucking my dick
And the whole 300 clique, get that suited; she coming with
Shooting niggas I'm on that, OTF I'm with that
This Kush let me hit that, that reg shit forget that
Shooting niggas I'm with that, popping Xan pills to forget that
You ain't did what I did, I ain't gotta shoot I'll send hitters
Matter fact them 10 year niggas, and I only fuck with real niggas
And when it's time, they always down to ride around and kill niggas
