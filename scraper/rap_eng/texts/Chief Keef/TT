[Intro]
I'm T
T
Turnt up, aye

[Hook]
I'm TT, aye
I'm TT, aye
I'm TT, aye
I'm TT, aye
I'm getting tree tree
Getting head by Keke
Nini with me
And she sitting pretty
And she sing like Whitney
And Britney, and Gaga
Like grra grra
'Til I die
High like Bob Marley
They like Sosa why you flexing, why not?

[Verse 1]
You don't want no smoke, bro
I'm tryna tell you what you don't know, bro
I pulled out 40 then bro broke
He took off running for the popo
My niggas gon' get you, fifty shooting like whistles
All I gotta do is whisper, karma gon' get ya
Bullets gon' hit ya, banana split ya
You want attention, it's gon' get ya
I give Tadoe the 4-O, boy
Nina turnt up, let her blow boy
Effing Keisha, I'ma 223 ya
I'm too turnt, bitch I'm too TT ya

[Hook]
I'm TT, aye
I'm TT, aye
I'm TT, aye
I'm TT, aye
I'm getting tree tree
Getting head by Keke
Nini with me
And she sitting pretty
And she sing like Whitney
And Britney, and Gaga
Like grra grra
'Til I die
High like Bob Marley
They like Sosa why you flexing, why not?
