[Verse 1: Chief Keef]

Roll dope fuck count money with a bitch name nina
Fuck with me and you'll get wet like aquafina
You don't want click clack my chopper beat 'em
And the if you standing you know I gotta leave 'em
Cock back are guns then we spazzin' out
When we hit the mall bitch we cashin' out
Gucci goggles on my face so I can't see 'em
Fuck nigga wanna get wet man I can't believe 'em

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]

Fuck nigga wanna get wet man I can't believe 'em
Choppas beat 'em
Went to see us then we leave 'em
Niggas can't never seen me shining so when they see us
We keep ninas

My block known for fucking up a happy house
Bitches be smiling 'cuz they see money Bitch what you happy 'bout
