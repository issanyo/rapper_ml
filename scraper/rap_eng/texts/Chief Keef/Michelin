[Intro: Chief Keef]
I just put a silencer
Almighty
On my gun
Glo gang
Know how we rockin' like cut off stockings
Keep kush in our pockets
Fuck nigga stop it

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I just put a silencer on my gun
I'm just like a scavenger on a hunt
These hoes don't like a nigga, they like my money
These niggas don't like a nigga, they all want somethin'
Well I'ma send my savages on a hunt
I had to put a bounty set on my hunt
Show no love, that shit get you killed and get you caught
I'm rollin', I'm Almighty Sosa Michelin

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Rollin' like the Michelin Man, with my many men
Fuck your petitions man, aye let's get it man
What's up with Benjamin, that's a nigga friend
God came and got me out and let a nigga in
I remember pushing white O's like the Michelin Man
I remember robbing white folks for they shit lil' man
I remember totin' my pole ready to get your man
I remember selling white dough to the piggies man
'Cause they came to get me man, at my grandma's house
And I let them in but I ain't open my mouth
They say 'How I get that?'
I told on my grandma, I get a damn check
Get my damn shit, and I spend it on dope
They ask how I sell it, I say I break it up hoe
And put it in that fast and then I sell it to those
Clucks who come to the back door
Tryna get a fix doe, and buy this shit doe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Matti Baybee]
Pockets like Michelin, hundred Benjamins
Don't do division, on my dividends
Cause my homies in penitents
Doing sentences, green face my president
Hundred Franklins
'Member when I wore the same clothes for a minute man
Now a youngin' counting bank rolls, making millions
So much designer I might change clothes, True Religion
Just might pull up in the Range Rove, hop out the mini vans
Kickin' doors with Timberlands, but I made it out
I just cashed a check, finna spend it on a house
Just got off the phone with Sosa he say 'Make it count'
Money on the counter, money on the couch
So we getting a check
You better not send no shots 'cause then we send it all back
I do not like no Prada, wear Giuseppe with that
These rapper think they hotter we add pressure to that

[Hook]
