[Hook: DKG]
That shit you talkin’, you ain’t bout that
In my hood, all my niggas ‘bout that
Never catch me slippin’, without that
Oh you ‘bout that? Dog, I really doubt that
You ain’t ‘bout that, nigga, you ain’t ‘bout that
You ain’t ‘bout that, nigga, you ain’t ‘bout that
Oh you ‘bout that? Dog, I really doubt that
You ain’t ‘bout that, nigga, you ain’t bout that

[Verse 1: DKG]
Put that fire on his grill if he playin’ chicken
Heat up in my hand but it ain’t from no damn mitten
Execution in my hood, like its san quentin
We don’t repeat, we switch gears like transmissions
‘Cause I go hard, replace fear with ambition
Face him with the ammunition if that man snitchin’
I go straight to the connect, I’m middleman pitchin’
‘Cause when y’all I was payin’ bitches I was payin’ attention
Saving street money, nigga I don’t need a pan or picture
I’ll be in the hood, it’s like you’re looking at a ninja
See my intention is to move weight just like I’m bitchin’
You ain’t bout that, nigga, all you niggas snitchin’

[Hook: DKG]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Pull up on a opp, push his scalp back
Pull up on our block, bitch, I doubt that
You gon’ freeze up with that glizzy, you ain’t ‘bout that
With loaded macs we show up where your house at
Nigga, put your money where your mouth at
‘Fore I put this forty where your mouth at
And blow your fuckin’ mouth back
You niggas inside , my niggas outside
On the block, where them scouts at
We got hundred shots with choppas, don’t make us sound that
On the block, where them scouts at
We got hundred shots, with choppas, don’t make us sound that

[Hook: DKG]
