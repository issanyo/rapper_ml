[Hook: Chief Keef]
So shawty make it clap shawty bring it back
If she throw it I'mma catch boy you can't handle that
GBE the squad GBE some stars
Live life like there's no tomorrow
This cash I throw it all

[Verse One: Ballout]
So shawty make it clap I’ma throw some stacks
But you gotta make it jiggle, gotta make it clap
Girl I'm Ballout, I got racks on top of racks
Everybody know Ballout gotta bag
I used to be on the corner pushing packs
Now every time you see me, I’m throwing stacks
In the strip club popping bottles, throwing stacks
Broke ass niggas can you boys handle that
Whats really finna hurt em, Sosa say he finna murk em
He say he finna charge $50,000 for a verse
I’m thinking like I’ma try to do it worse
Throwing all this all Monday night just splurging
Watching bad bitches just twerk and they work
You ain’t gotta show out Ima throw the money on purpose
I don't give a damn if your ass I ain't worth it
I’m ball out like I'm fucking Julius Erving

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Dro]
So shawty make it clap like a nigga spent a stack
And I'mma bring it back, like a nigga holding racks
Your bitch is on my sack, she says she like the way I rap
Been seeing her for a while, she knew me when I used to trap
AMG Benz in the lot on 4's
Lamborghini doors help finesse these hoes
I'm in strip club dropping bands on her
Bitches getting mad on how I’m fucking with her
But I don’t give no fuck cause I’m a Glory Boy
See us in the club making all the noise
In the parking lot with them foreign toys
Thotties from the burbs call us foreign boys
Gon make it clap like you know we got them stacks
And we gon do our thing, and blow a couple racks
GBE the squad
Ya'll know just who we are
Sosa, Dro, and Ballout all of us are superstars

[Hook x2]
