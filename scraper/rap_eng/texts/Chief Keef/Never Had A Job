[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
Wake up every day, bitch I feel like a star
Gang with me don't get your ass popped
Tweak with the squad we gon' take this shit far
Finesse a fucking clown don't get your ass rocked
Just bought some pints man, finna get some pops
When I'm in the mall don't leave my gun in the car
Real trap nigga, man I never had a job
Real trap nigga, man I never had a job

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Spent a real big sack and it's still on the receipt in the register
I just stepped out Balenciagas lavender
Baptized your bitch you know I gotta Reverend her
Shit we just committed I ain't telling her
Jury say I'm guilty, tryna stick me in the box
Told my lawyer I was counting guap and getting top
My young niggas fighting for they life, I gotta break them out
Just found out your hiding spot, I got them staking out
Slide down, we ain't dining in, we gotta take them out
Leave a fuck nigga on the ground and have them rake em out
Call up the nearest Clark Kent, tell him save them now
Peel off in that Bruce Wayne, gotta make it out
I'm addicted to money and fancy cars
You ain't Glory Boy you ain't Savage Squad
You know you can't be out after dark
Let the tech and mac off, that's a damn menage
My bitch got an ass like Nicki Minaj
Went through her phone all I see is my collage
I'm 61st and foreigns all up in my garages
They be hating on me trying to sabotage

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
Wake up every day, bitch I feel like a star
Gang with me don't get your ass popped
Tweak with the squad we gon' take this shit far
Finesse a fucking clown don't get your ass rocked
Just bought some pints man, finna get some pops
When I'm in the mall don't leave my gun in the car
Real trap nigga, man I never had a job
Real trap nigga, man I never had a job

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Sneak dissing on the net, I put money on your head
Damn, the next day they found your ass dead
All face shots man we don't shoot at legs
Middle fingers to the opps, Middle fingers to the feds
I let them play with big guns like them ARs
You ain't Glory Boy, you ain't Savage Squad
You ain't from the streets, you ain't with the mob
Caught a nigga slipping, I was camouflaged
Shoot him in the face leave him in his fucking yard
With that fucking chopper, I be flipping cards
Got shorties 15 ready to catch a charge
And they be on Front Street yelling Savage Squad

[Chorus: Fredo Santana]
Wake up every day, bitch I feel like a star
Gang with me don't get your ass popped
Tweak with the squad we gon' take this shit far
Finesse a fucking clown don't get your ass rocked
Just bought some pints man, finna get some pops
When I'm in the mall don't leave my gun in the car
Real trap nigga, man I never had a job
Real trap nigga, man I never had a job
