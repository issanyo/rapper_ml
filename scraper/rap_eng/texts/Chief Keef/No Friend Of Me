[Hook: Stunt Taylor]
If he broke he ain't no friend of me
Wearing fake designer, he ain't no friend of me
Money long and still stretching like a centipede
Extended clips and prayers for all my enemies

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
He ain't no friend of me kill that fucking nigga like my enemy
I'm tired of this nigga being in front of me
All these dinners killing me, my energy (Gang)
Catch a fuck nigga show him what he meant to me (Bang Bang)
And I cop this MAC, it go right back
You told those dudes dude sound like a high hat
I'm towing on this chopper, it go grat grat
Same puss I beg for then I pay for my head
Send me up, baby girl, don't try that
I got my fellow me and every mob gat
Too much tooka pack where my life at
Roll this calm out this chopper, where the knife at?
They say when you're rich, you can't have broke friends
I guess I just noticed that
They with you when you're rich but when it all ends
Bet that shit be all over with

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Twista]
I still want none, get on a track and I go dumb
Keep talking shit, you see them BDs come
And the Lords come and them folks come
And they be coming with some shit, better click at it, clack
Clip after clip after Mac and some shit that'll rip out your back
Hollow heavy hitter, bullets'll slip out the crack
My haters get ghost, what, chewing all that money
You were saying to me you ain't got a prop or job
You're a shame to me, half nigga always in the club
You were thot to me, can't pay for VIP, parking, you broke to me
Used to got no money, you mistaking me
For that other nigga that you seen, he ain't none of me
Pull up in that Benz with no key, sit on 4 G's
Killers all behind me, send this bitch up, G
