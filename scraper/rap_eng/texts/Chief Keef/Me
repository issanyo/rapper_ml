[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I got a bitch, she is from Italia
Smoking on this earth, this gas and shit be filling me up
You think it's your time but it could be up
That's why I got a 30 on me nigga try me it could be up
Tell Tadoe slow ass pour a four of that lean
I love that gwop like I love Kay Kay, it's like my daughter to me
Shit my bank account looks like Norbit to me
Say you gettin' gwop, nigga show it to me... Or try me

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Like Tony Montana who I trust: me
But it's still more Sosa and less Tony
I know niggas plot, and I know they want me but this hammer on me
I got some niggas in that cut ready to blam you, homie
And they don't give a fuck about your family, homie
Bitch I'm glo'd all up, put the cameras on me
Bitch I'm Almighty Sosa, no Capone, no Meech
I glo niggas up, get them guns and they gon' be blowing for me
I was tryna disguise how'd you know it was me
You got a pistol nigga blow it at me
You know I'm flexing

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I got a bitch, she is from Italia
Smoking on this earth, this gas and shit be filling me up
You think it's your time but it could be up
That's why I got a 30 on me nigga try me it could be up
Tell Tadoe slow ass pour a four of that lean
I love that gwop like I love Kay Kay, it's like my daughter to me
Shit my bank account looks like Norbit to me
Say you gettin' gwop, nigga show it to me... Or try me

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
I'm working the trap, I'm checking a bag, I'm shaking the D
I'm selling a half, I'm selling them fast, they sell it for me
You run in my trap looking for stash, I'm shooting for free
Aim at your chest or shoot at your head, you fall to your knees
Niggas be like for a verse from Tadoe, gon' cost me a Jeep
House look like the mall, took the bitch there and I bought her some D
These niggas they watching, these bitches they watching, eyes all on me
Pop out the cut and light his ass up, hope he don't fall on me
Pick my lil guys up, take their ass shopping and it's all on me
Just came back from another show, all the God damn 100s on me
Got a club headed back to your friends come through bitch party on me
I tell that bitch to ride it fast like a Ducati on me

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I got a bitch, she is from Italia
Smoking on this earth, this gas and shit be filling me up
You think it's your time but it could be up
That's why I got a 30 on me nigga try me it could be up
Tell Tadoe slow ass pour a four of that lean
I love that gwop like I love Kay Kay, it's like my daughter to me
Shit my bank account looks like Norbit to me
Say you gettin' gwop, nigga show it to me... Or try me
