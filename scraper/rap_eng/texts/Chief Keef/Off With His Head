[Intro: Chief Keef]
Smokin' on this Tooka
Plottin' on a million
Got alotta children
These niggas my children
Tryna smoke some Tooka
This shit it might kill you
Tryna get some money
My nigga I feel you

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Coolin with the Glo
That's my La'Familia
For my family I'll kill ya
At the red light drill ya
Pull up on you slow
Ride off like a Steeler
I think I'm from Pittsburgh
Bitch I got my steel up
'Member being a stealer
Your car could get peeled up
Baby I heard your car on E
Fuck with me, it get filled up
When I look in the mirror
I see a young black nigga
That made it out the South Side where the fucking drills was
Ridin' with my toolie
And I'm down to drill ya
Waste your ass, spill ya
Flintstones, Fred and Wilma
She gon give me coochie
Until my fucking deal up
It can go down anytime but I'm still up

[Outro: Chief Keef]
Niggas at your freaking head
Click clack, runnin' scared
I'mma run these mother-fucking people just like Diddy did
Get my alcohol, weed, and my business is
Savage just like Bean's, thats who Beanie Sigel is
At them poles he shoot
Like I play for heat and shit
Pistol beatin' shit
You don't know what a pistol beatin' is
Ridin' round town praying to god with the sig
Smoke a nigga like a cig
Bang! Off with his head
Aye!
