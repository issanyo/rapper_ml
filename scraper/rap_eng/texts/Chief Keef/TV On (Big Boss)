[Chorus]
Long live the big boss (Fredo!)
Put you on a big cross
I'm a fuckin' big dog
New scope, get picked off
My plug love me
He know I get it all
50 in the glickie
You can come get it all
A bitch face in a nigga draws
I'm the nigga your bitch be calling
Bitch, I'm higher than Cheech and Chong
Cops behind us, keep it calm
Bitch, don't bother me, leave me alone
You don't need to know what street we on
Bitch, put yo 3Ds on
Ice movie like the TV on

[Verse 1]
You got the ammo?
You want the Anna?
Better be a cheetah
Better be a panther
We in the spotty
Watchin' the cameras
Flew a bitch to LA, from Atlanta
You niggas funny
Y'all should do stand up
That heat in hand, turn your shit to winter
Bankroll all up on my mantle
Chef here, wonder what's for dinner?
I don't give a fuck, fuck, fuck
Two doors up
Told the clerk you ain't done
Bitch it's two more of us
I just lost my fuckin' cousin
Ain't no tellin' how I get it
Don't be fuckin' with my mulah
We'll air ya bout this shit

[Chorus]
Long live the big boss
Put you on a big cross
I'm a fuckin' big dog
New scope, get picked off
My plug love me
He know I get it all
50 in the glickie
You can come get it all
A bitch face in a nigga draws
I'm the nigga your bitch be calling
Bitch, I'm higher than Cheech and Chong
Cops behind us, keep it calm
Bitch, don't bother me, leave me alone
You don't need to know what street we on
Bitch, put yo 3Ds on
Ice movie like the TV on

[Verse 2]
Chief Sosa up in the cut
Feds asking bout me, don't give me up
Dopey dopey it get me rushed
Nigga say he gon' get me touched
Used to tell niggas, "Pick me up"
Used to tell bitches, "Look me up"
Used to ride around semi'd up
Behind my foreign there's a semi truck
Me and [?] got semis in it, foe 'nem go dummy in it
You can't fit in the whip, bitch I'm actin' funny in it
Drank put my tummy in it, dope smokes got a onion in it
Bitches showin' they fuckin' titties
Let's make a toast, we fuckin', did it
Glory Boys, bitch that's the movement
Six cars and seven toolies
Real smooth, that's how we movin'
Go [?], yeah that a [?]
I just fucked a bitch named Miranda, too
And I fucked in my Yeezys, too
And I'm stackin' this shit up
And I put that on Jesus, too

[Chorus]
Long live the big boss
Put you on a big cross
I'm a fuckin' big dog
New scope, get picked off
My plug love me
He know I get it all
50 in the glickie
You can come get it all
A bitch face in a nigga draws
I'm the nigga your bitch be calling
Bitch, I'm higher than Cheech and Chong
Cops behind us, keep it calm
Bitch, don't bother me, leave me alone
You don't need to know what street we on
Bitch, put yo 3Ds on
Ice movie like the TV on
