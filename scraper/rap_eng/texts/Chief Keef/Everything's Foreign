[Hook x4]
She only like me because everything's foreign
Don't fuck with white tees because everything's foreign
I'm GBE, and your boyfriend super nomal
If it ain't foreign, then I don't want it

[Verse 1]
I'm smokin' dope, I ain't fucking with that normal
Pull up on yo' bitch, yeah she's a goner
You can have her back, homie I don't want her
All a nigga want was the top from her
Chief Sosa came in hotter than the summer
That bitch want my number, she got to fuck my brother
I got a foreign bitch, that bitch native
I treat the hoes like Kelly, motivate them
Smoking dope, I think I'm in a spaceship
I pull me out some lean, and I take sips
I rock Gucci, Louie, shop in Italy
That's why all these hoes they be feeling me
