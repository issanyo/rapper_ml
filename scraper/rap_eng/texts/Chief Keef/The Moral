[Hook]
The moral of the story is the glory
The moral of the story, these niggas shorty
The moral of the gas I smoke a week
The moral of the cash I blow a week
The moral of the X, I pop an E
The moral of these niggas, they act like a lot of me
The moral of the story, hear the shots, my G
The moral of the story, bitch I brought my guap with me

[Verse 1]
The moral of the story, gang, gang
The moral of the story, gang bang
Chain on, nigga, bling bling
The moral of the story, Johnny Dang
He sayin' somethin', he hears shots for days
The moral of the story, I ain't playin'
My dick feel like, "fuck I don't, not today"
Moral of the story gotta get this paper
You don't wanna work for me? I'll slave yah
The moral of the story, I'm a president, not a mayor
Roll up in the shop, I be spendin' paper
Moral of the story, nigga, I be gettin' paper
Moral of the story, if I see your thot I take her
Moral of the story, that bitch rape me, I don't rape her
I'm flexin' real hard, shoes cost 2 school bus drivers paycheck
Moral of the story, my shoes cost what you ain't get paid yet

The moral of the car I drive
The moral of the thots that I got
The moral of the cash that I spend
The moral of the numbers I get
The moral of the TECs that I pop
The moral of the shots in my Glock

Moral of the story, can't trust, watch niggas
On the fuckin' piss, here pi√±a colada, nigga
Moral of the story, I ain't worried 'bout nada, nigga
