[Hook]
I got lots of cash in this Louie bag
I got pistols in this Gucci bag
I can't trust a sheriff they fuck you for a Gucci bag
Fuck that shit I spent 3,000 on a Louie bag
Why bitch? Cause I get that Louie cash
Dont make me up this pistol out this Louie bag
And get blood on my Louie bag
I'm shooting slugs out this Louie bag

[Verse 1]
Bitch, I ain't no postman Im the movie man
Got clips like the movie man
Come through niggas moving man
We ain't Foe nem we shooting man
At your top
Shooting up out the tee top
Coming through your block gratata
With the choppa waka flocka
You was gambling with your life, pay me back
If that nigga owe me he gon pay me back
Pull up in the foreign
All the bad bitches going

[Bridge]
Where we going, bitch we touring
Prolly won't be back till the morning, or next year
Gotta get some gifts
Gotta get 160 mil

[Hook]
