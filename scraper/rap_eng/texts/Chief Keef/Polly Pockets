[Hook]
Damn, look at how my diamonds dancing
Look at how she money dancing
Look at how this money dancing
Niggas acting funny, damn it
Bitches acting like they want me
But they really want my money
I told that bitch stop being dumb please
You only want my pockets Polly

[Verse]
I got a bitch named Kesha
But I call her Polly Pocket
I got a bitch named Britney
But I call her Polly Pocket
I got a bitch named Kesha
But I call her Polly Pocket
I got a bitch named Britney
But I call her Polly Pocket
Cause they only want my pockets
Cause they only want my pockets
Cause they only want my pockets

[Hook]
Damn, look at how my diamonds dancing
Look at how she money dancing
Look at how this money dancing
Niggas acting funny, damn it
Bitches acting like they want me
But they really want my money
I told that bitch stop being dumb please
You only want my pockets Polly
