[Intro]
I'm working on dying
Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo
Oogie Mane, he killed it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay, Brandon, why you do that?

[Chorus: MATT OX]
Walked through with them knots and I feel like Cheddar Bob, yeah
All my diamonds gloss, all my diamonds, yeah, they glossy
Stop talkin' (woo), pull up, I make you want that (Yeah, yeah)
My diamonds, they gon' keep on jumpin' (Yeah, yeah)
I came from the block where you cannot even cross, yeah (No way)
I ain't never had no Santa Claus, yeah (No way)
They mad 'cause I'm gettin' bags (They mad)
I ain't even sleep yet, I still got jet lag (Jet lag)

[Verse 1: MATT OX]
I ain't leave the streets yet, I'm still in Philly (Philly)
Eatin' filets ('Lets), with my whole gang (Gang), that's it (It)
It's time to get rich, it's time to get lit, that's it
Young Matt is the kid, they had to go flip, that's it
Heard you drivin' while I'm driftin', that's it
Ridin' round in birds, we ain't whippin', that's it (We ain't whippin')
Heard you fryin' when I'm winnin', that's it (I win)
My lil shawty saw me with a woman, donâ€™t trip

[Chorus: MATT OX]
Walked through with them knots and I feel like Cheddar Bob, yeah
All my diamonds gloss, all my diamonds, yeah, they glossy
Stop talkin' (woo), pull up, I make you want that (Yeah, yeah)
My diamonds, they gon' keep on jumpin' (Yeah, yeah)
I came from the block where you cannot even cross, yeah (No way)
I ain't never had no Santa Claus, yeah (No way)
They mad 'cause I'm gettin' bags (They mad)
I ain't even sleep yet, I still got jet lag (Jet lag)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I'm poured up, dope give me a buzz (Dope)
Ho, hold up, light 'em up like bugs (Let's get it)
That's your job, get up off my nuts (Get off my dick)
He actin' tough, light him up like a club (Boom boom boom boom)
I heard your trap slow, it's a lightyear like Buzz (Bitch)
Yeah, he a clout daddy, he do shit for the plug (Nigga, you a bitch)
I pull up, like a bird, kacaw (Kacaw)
He's all that shit, how the fuck he in love (Damn)
Stop talkin' 'fore we pull up, spark it (Skrt, gang)
Your security, they can feel this hot shit (Brr)
It's the dirt gang, boy, don't be a target (Don't be that shit, man)
I be flexin', she wanna meet the spark team (Catch up)

[Chorus: MATT OX]
Walked through with them knots and I feel like Cheddar Bob, yeah
All my diamonds gloss, all my diamonds, yeah, they glossy
Stop talkin' (woo), pull up, I make you want that (Yeah, yeah)
My diamonds, they gon' keep on jumpin' (Yeah, yeah)
I came from the block where you cannot even cross, yeah (No way)
I ain't never had no Santa Claus, yeah (No way)
They mad 'cause I'm gettin' bags (They mad)
I ain't even sleep yet, I still got jet lag (Jet lag)
