[Hook]
Phone going dumb
Bitches going bonkers
Baby I come from the sun
That's why I'm always Gloing
I pull up these niggas run
Cause I'm always fucking blowing
You know these niggas be my sons
How you know and I ain't even know

[Verse 1]
Ooh, I gets lots of ooh
I don't beef with you
I beef with no fool
Counting a lot of cool
Hundreds and they blue
White on my shoes
Fuck whatever you want to do
You get pussy cool, you get money cool
Pull them blue hundreds out my pocket
I pulled them up out the blue
Jumped up in the pool, your bitch in my room
She can't come to the pool, it's only for Glo
I got weed, I got aim, I got bills, I got drank
Where you from? What you bang?
What you claim? Where you hang?
You whipped that bitch like she ain't fucking
But that bitch out here thoting like it ain't nothing

[Hook]
Phone going dumb
Bitches going bonkers
Baby I come from the sun
That's why I'm always Gloing
I pull up these niggas run
Cause I'm always fucking blowing
You know these niggas be my sons
How you know and I ain't even know

[Verse 2]
Pull up skrt-skrt-skrt, hop out duh-duh-duh
Riding a real a deal, real a deal
Shoot at foot and foot, What a deal a deal
What I'm smoking uh, What I'm sipping uh
When I ride uh
I got your bitch last night
She hit me and said she riding uh
She just want to waste all of my time and I ain't got enough
All is want to do is count my money and get high as fuck
She gon' suck me up then I pull up
The she do what I told her
Baby girl I know I'm bi-polar
I remember when I dreamed of riding Rovers
Know I'm shining from my wrist to my shoulders
Looking for your bitch we be up in my mansion fucking

[Hook]
Phone going dumb
Bitches going bonkers
Baby I come from the sun
That's why I'm always Gloing
I pull up these niggas run
Cause I'm always fucking blowing
You know these niggas be my sons
How you know and I ain't even know
