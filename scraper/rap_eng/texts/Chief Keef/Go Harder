[Hook]
Bitch I go harder (x8)
We be goin hard, hard, hard, hard, hard, hard

[Verse 1]
I be at yo front door for my money waiting on it
I go hard for this cash you can go debate on it
When I get some new cash what I do lay on it
When I get some new cash I let my daughter play on it
When I get some new guns, know I gotta beat em'
Got he subpoena playing with the nina just like it was Tina
You can gone and act dumb till I up the heater
I'ma Beat em' Ima beat em' just like his father would treat em'
I am the one, the one with the gun, the one with the bitches
The one with the money, the one with the cars
The one with the plug, the one with the pills, the drink all the drugs

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Goin hard, Goin Hard, Go hard or go home
Get up in ya car take a spin lil bitch
Disappear lil bitch dont come back here lil bitch
You ain't giving up shit
Remember pulling up on St. Lawrence
Bullets fixing niggas Dr. Carter
Remember walking up on St. Lawrence
Y'all gon' send shots but we gon' send em harder
Bitch we go hard, hard, hard, hard fuck all the fraud
We don't need no Guards, Guards Guards
We don't need no motherfuckin' Bodyguards

[Hook]
