[Verse: Chief Keef]
GBE the squad it's just us we don't need nobody
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's going down that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange)
If nobody's holding you back from me
(Cause I know how you usually do)
When you say everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who

Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby

All these bitches, know I get dough
Pop a nigga soul like crisco
I’m smokin on the gas like Citgo
Fat ass on my bitch though
Big rims, on my whips though
30 clips, all my clips go
You talk a lot but you ain’t on shit though
We let off shots, you ‘bout to get hit though

I’m Southside, I’ll pop out
OBlock bring them Glocks out
300 bring them chops out
We shoot up your block now
Fredo bring them Glocks out
Reese bring them crates out
I'mma bring them racks out
Make your bitch wanna stay out
But don't think she gone get paid now
I just like to play round
With niggas I don't play round
My boys shoot up the playground
So please don't get sprayed now
Sirens on the way now
We can do this all day now
Shoot you what you say now
I know she wanna come up
Cause I got lots of commas
Louie and Ferragamo
This why I'm so stuck up
High off earth I'm fucked up
Bankroll got me puffed up
She got a fat ass then you know that I'mma fuck her

All these bitches, know I get dough
Pop a nigga soul like crisco
I’m smokin on the gas like Citgo
Fat ass on my bitch though
Big rims, on my whips though
30 clips, all my clips go
You talk a lot but you ain’t on shit though
We let off shots, you ‘bout to get hit though
