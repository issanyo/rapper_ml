[Intro: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci, brrrrrrrrr
Metro, metro

[Hook: Gucci Mane]
I be first day of school fresh
First day of school fresh, first day of school fresh
First day of school fresh
Kill 'em with the J's, I'm the first to get 'em
My denim so exclusive everybody fuckin' with 'em
Cause they first day of school fresh, first day of school fresh
First day of school fresh

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I be first day of school G
Wear first day of school jeans
First day of school money, first day of school things
If I still went to school, I would walk in so icy
I'm always winning trophies, that's why niggas don't like me
First day of school, if you ain't first then you lose
Second day of school but that's under you
Walk up in the school with a tool, I'm a fool
And I got the dope, Like who wanna smoke
Then I'm catch 'em [?] hey
Hennessy out I pour
Money all in my pores, that's how I was born
Ain't even going first day of school
They gone call my mom and I know it
Always on the block, hanging with my boys

[Hook: Gucci Mane]

[Interlude: Chief Keef]
Ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey, ey
With the J's, how I get 'em?
I walk in the school, everybody fuckin' with him
Where the J's? How I get 'em?
I walk up the school and everybody fuckin' with 'em
Metro
