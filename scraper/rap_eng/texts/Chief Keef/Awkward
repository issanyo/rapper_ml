[Intro]
Niggas acting very awkward (did you see my car)
Pussy pull down yo skirt (Did you see my gwop)
Smoking on gas, it hurt (Did you see them)
Aye, aye, aye, duh-duuh
Did you see gwop
Did you see my car
Did you see my daughter
Got so much ice on her
Did you see them (4x)

[Hook]
Did you see my gwop
Did you see my car
Did you see my daughter
Got so much ice on her
Did you see my mother
Did you see my father
They been lost me back then I was raised by a bunch of apes
Smoking on Lord Farquaad
My weed the same price as my quad
Foreigns all up in my yard
Niggas acting very awkward

[Verse 1]
Niggas acting very awkward, aye
Pussy pull down your skirt, aye
I'm smoking on gas, it hurt
Niggas try me, bullets fly like Nerf
What I need with my pancakes, syrup
What I need with this me, money, and no one
Cause niggas is about to turn
So I gotta be ready with my pole
Niggas always talking shit til we come through popping shit
30 always dropping shit
Handling problems, doctor it
30 went the opposite
Kill a nigga, hyper shit
Get some money, buy some shit
Guns singing like Ronald Isley, bitch
Big house in the woods, on some Tiger shit
Smoking sour, on my lemon shit
This bitch do what I say, on my Simon shit
I guess I'm Almighty Simon then

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm belligerent, but my neck is like a fridgerent
When I come through niggas fidgeting
They don't want no cancer from this cigarette
I'ma eagle, you just pigeon shit
Bitch you roll to the end of it
Kay Kay home, you need some M's lil bitch
Get what I want, bitch I just sent for it
Nigga try to rob me, my chopper gone go dudu-duh
Pull off in my car, my car go skrt-skrt
I rather you talk about what you used to do
Not what you coulda did
I swear I was doing 117
Smoking dope got me heaven man
Me and Ben Franklin arrogant
Moving on up, bitch I'm Jefferson
Cause I like Pelle's bitch, never know we shooting at yo bitch
Smoking gas and shit
Never know when I lose my life lil bitch
Acting deaf and shit
But I bet you hear these pops lil bitch
Taking breaths and shit
Pull up on yo block, incite some shit
Bang
Come take all yo drugs, indict some shit
Boy you smoking on Kay Kay diaper shit
She like me cause I live by Mikey shit
And no matter what bitch I'm the shit
