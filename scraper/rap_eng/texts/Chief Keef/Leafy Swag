We in the big body hogging up two lanes
With the loud pack kicking like Luke Cain
Bitch I been establish my status I ain't no new name
When I'm in the building I don't give a fuck who came
Hold up, roll up, slow up, pour up
Flip a hand and the six for the fifty, b-b-b-bitch I'm tow up
Red eyes dark shades bitch I'm high a fuck
Still on point though if a nigga want to try me let him try his luck

Ridin' round we swerve
Had alot of guns no words
My bitch smell so purp
She sucking dick so perf'
I'm ballin' hard like Kobe
Shootin' bricks like Kirby
Young wild ass nigga
Wild ass bitch burping
One time we keep cameras on
Fuck PM's I stand alone
Holding bricks put your cameras on
Young niggas, getting hoes
OTF we in this now
Real niggas, be with us
We stank shit ain't killing niggas
We ain't shootin' shit can't be with us
