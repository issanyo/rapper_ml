[Hook]
I bought two pounds off Earth﻿ and smoke with no one, I am that nigga doe
Yes I am a star but I got niggas that will kick ya door
All these hoes thirsty, no they can't kick it doe
These hoes just want credit that's why ain't none in my videos
I rather have my 'migos, three zero zero
I think I'm El Chapo, boy you worth a kilo
I'm coolin' wit my vatos, cause they speak my lingo
It's just me and Wop doe, lookin' out the peephole

[Verse 1]
And we see you niggas on the outside looking in doe
Bitch, I'm rich as fuck, bitch I be outside smoking indo
Pull up in my M6, I ain't got no tint doe
I just love stunting when I see your bitch doe
And I can’t trust niggas, Ben Franklin my friend doe
Where I'm from its fuck niggas, I only fuck with endo
I just met a bad bitch, that bitch in Brazil doe
Said she like me cause I'm icey, we can't have no kids doe
I just got a Jew bitch, she don't like no negros
Look at my jewels bitch, I'm shining like a disco
I'm smoking on this dope, I swear this shit’s some gas from Citgo
I don't fuck with fuck niggas, I fuck with their bitch doe
