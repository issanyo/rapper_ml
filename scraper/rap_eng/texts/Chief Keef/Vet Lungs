[Hook: Chief Keef]
Glocks tucked man I up (I up)
I ah Damage ya (damage ya)
Wassup with all these fuck niggas? (fuck)
I'm sorry for the weight I couldn't help (I couldn't help)
I was always smoking on the skunk (smoking on the skunk)
Bad bitch in my truck she tryna fuck
My necklace it be shining to my junk
I be smokin' dope baby I got vet lungs (bling, bling)

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Blood gang, Blood dripping over here
You want problems, you can get it over here
You don't listen, better listen over here
If you don't, I bring them pistols over there
I come through and put the pistol to your ear
I come through, I put the pistol to your rib
I was getting money I was taking it as gifts (taking it as gifts)
I'm still getting money I'm still getting it how I live (getting it how I live)
My wrist real, real chill, I chill (I chill)
I ain't never cold bitch I feel how I feel
I got 10 fans on and I live how I live
I'm a plan to keep growin' and I peel how I peel

Sorry for the W-E-I-G-H-T
Bitch I know it's W-A-I-T, ight b?
Aye I come through Mr.T
White Tee and bright things
Ain't got no cuban links, I got on a breitling
We know drama TNT, Hercules, Disney
We got cannons, Nicki, Nickelodeon, Jimmy
I got that cartoon network, and that net work WG
If you looking for me, I'm with money in a meeting
Me and you we got money disagreements
Can't come to no conclusions
Cause your money ain't worth me yet
If I upload a status I don't need no feedback
I don't give a mothafuck who fuckin' we at
