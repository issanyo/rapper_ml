[Hook]
I ain't have no choice
No choice
Baby, you ain't got no choice
Nigga, you ain't got no choice
I bought this car, I ain't have no choice
I bought this house, I ain't have no choice
I bought this watch, I ain't have no choice
I got this guap, I ain't have no choice
You can get shot, I ain't got no choice

[Verse 1]
No choices, no choices
I'm off loud, I hear voices
And I brought my boys with
And we brought our toys with
We gon' get to scoring shit
Number one on our D. Rose shit
Just be buckets with this pole, bitch
I'm at the three line and I'm going in
Eating so good, got money on my chin
Bought a car, spent ya rent money on my rims
Glo Gang on everything, Glo Gang on my Timbs
Toss some shit, now you face all like (?)
All my guns up in Tonka, smoking on that skunk stuff
No choices, my chain 84 karats, bitch, Bugs Bunny
Brought my boys with and I'm gonna let 'em blow, I really can't say nothing
No swords on this motherfucking booth, we got Glocks and bitch I'ma pop it

[Hook]
I ain't have no choice
No choice
Baby, you ain't got no choice
Nigga, you ain't got no choice
I bought this car, I ain't have no choice
I bought this house, I ain't have no choice
I bought this watch, I ain't have no choice
I got this guap, I ain't have no choice
You can get shot, I ain't got no choice
