[Intro]
Now I got fucking wings
Now I got fucking wings
Gave a nigga Redbull, now I got fucking wings

[Hook]
Shouldn't gave a young nigga Redbull, now I got fucking wings
Nigga say he gon' defeat me, in his fucking dreams
Bitch say she wanna (?) me, I only sleep with the cream
Bitch look at my watch how it's glistening, look like a whip cream

[Verse 1]
Gold watch, white diamonds
Johnny Dang, white shining
Gold chain, white diamonds
Gold diamonds, I'ma diamond
Sneak diss, white lines and
Never on time, but it's right timing
Fishy shit, I be slamming
Eating every fucking thang
Bitch I lease shit
Bitch I need some credit
Pull off in that anything
I fucking won
Swear to fucking God
Pull up in that 22, flexing

[Hook]
Shouldn't gave a young nigga Redbull, now I got fucking wings
Nigga say he gon' defeat me, in his fucking dreams
Bitch say she wanna (?) me, I only sleep with the cream
Bitch look at my watch how it's glistening, look like a whip cream

[Verse 2]
The pills got me heating, my diamonds are breathing
Why am I not breathing, these pills are some demons
Swear this shit so scary
Scare-o, run up pull up in that narrow
Shoot you with an arrow
Had to name my Forgiatos fargo
I call fargo like hello
They say I need a bullet proof or something medical
Pull up, hoes can't believe I did this
Turn my Rollie to a bullet proof missile
If I found him, blow the whistle
Can buy anything, remember telling grandma my picture

[Hook]
Shouldn't gave a young nigga Redbull, now I got fucking wings
Nigga say he gon' defeat me, in his fucking dreams
Bitch say she wanna (?) me, I only sleep with the cream
Bitch look at my watch how it's glistening, look like a whip cream
