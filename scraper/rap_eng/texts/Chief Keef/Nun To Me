[Hook]
Damn I heard your nigga phone
Well baby, fuck with me
You wanna get high, wanna hit this strong?
Well baby, cough on me
His bitch won't stop calling my phone
She wanna fuck with me
'Cause I've been doing these niggas wrong
Can't none of them fuck with me
We see a opp, we get 'em gone
We don't discuss a thing
Pour a 4 in a 25
And now I'm off the lean
Tell your bitch to fuck with me

[Verse 1]
I spend that shit, it's nun to me
I hit that bitch, she nun to me
I did that shit, it's nun to me
Tell yo bitch to fuck with me
In my pocket hundred bricks and hundred keys
On my watch and chain I spend a hundred G's
She like Sosa, when I seen you on TV I couldn't believe
I'm like I don't know but bitch I feel undefeated
Tony Romo bitch, I got my nine on me
Smoke his ass like some vienna beef
She wanna smoke some earth and get up off some lean
I told her ass to fuck with me

[Hook]
Damn I heard your nigga phone
Well baby, fuck with me
You wanna get high, wanna hit this strong?
Well baby, cough on me
His bitch won't stop calling my phone
She wanna fuck with me
'Cause I've been doing these niggas wrong
Can't none of them fuck with me
We see a opp, we get 'em gone
We don't discuss a thing
Pour a 4 in a 25
And now I'm off the lean
Tell your bitch to fuck with me
