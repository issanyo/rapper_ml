[Intro]
I'm so cold
I'm so cold
I'm so cold, my wrist froze
I'm so cold, wipe my nose
I'm so cold, wipe my nose
I'm so cold, my time froze
Hop out Glo, my white clothes
Nothing but poles and bankrolls

[Hook]
I'm so cold, wipe my nose
I'm so cold, my time froze
Hop out Glo, my white clothes
Nothing but poles and bankrolls
My bitch be cold, my niggas be cold
My guns, my cars, my house, my city be cold
But I grew up out that shit like a centipede though
And now I'm Glo'd, bitch nigga try me, it'll be cold

[Verse 1]
Cops behind me, I don't know
Where go where I want go
I was touring, come home
Bitch I'm cold, I got the smoke
I got some dough, I want some more
I'm off this dope, I want some more
She got this dope, she want some more
She want some dope, I told her no
Now you know it's time to go
Grab your coat, hit the road
Bitch, don't come back no more
'Cause you couldn't Glo fucking with So
It's me and my hoes and my hoes
It's me and the Glo, them my bros
I'll sleep in the cold with my pole
'Cause I can't trust a soul

[Hook]
I'm so cold, wipe my nose
I'm so cold, my time froze
Hop out Glo, my white clothes
Nothing but poles and bankrolls
My bitch be cold, my niggas be cold
My guns, my cars, my house, my city be cold
But I grew up out that shit like a centipede though
And now I'm Glo'd, bitch nigga try me, it'll be cold
