[Chief Keef Verse 1]
When I saw you last night
I tripped out cause
Last time I saw you
You was mad right
Now you smiling
Now thats right
You were in love and
I was on drugs
I wasn't rich yet
I was a thug

[Chief Keef Chorus 1]
Girl you make go
Whoooaaaaoooo
You make me go
Whoooaaaaoooo
You make me go
Whoa
You make me go
Whoa
You make me go
Whoa
You make me go
Whoaooooo

[Chief Keef Verse 2]
When I see you, I smell, my brothers like, "what's that?"
And I'm like, "when she leaves my mind she comes right back"
And they're like, "ooh baby, you're tripping in that stack"
'Cause I'm smiling and they know that we didn't have sex
I'll ride with you in my passenger seat
I'll stop seeing women that I see every week
I'll put my guard down and we'll go out to eat
If this was all a dream, I'll see you in my sleep
