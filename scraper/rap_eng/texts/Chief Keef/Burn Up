[Verse 2]
This nigga say he wanna run up
I heard that he don't have a gun up
He come for me, he better have his gun up
Cuz it's dangerous, my gun is hungry
Make a nigga bleed, through his head, his nose and his teeth
I cool with the B's, I cool with the C's
All them niggas know Chief Keef
I'm like turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
Finna hit the club, turn up, turn up
A nigga act up he get burned up, burned up
No talking, just burn 'em, burn 'em
Run up on 'em with this .40
Run up on 'em with this shotty
It's a 12 gauge buck shots in that hoe, 'bout 40
Cuz I brought some extra shit, cuz I am an extra nigga
Everything I do is extra, niggas in their extra feelings
