Hop in my car, swag and I swag
Niggas mad cuz I got swag in a bag
He bought his bitch a bag
I put his bitch in a bag
It can't fit in my pocket, cash, put that shit in a bag

Walk in the bank with bags
Moonwalking with the cash
Blitzing these niggas straight Madden
Hail Marying the cash
Walk up in it, it's bout swagging
Gettin' every bitch that's bad with my swag

[Verse 1]
I'm getting every bitch that's bad with my swag
