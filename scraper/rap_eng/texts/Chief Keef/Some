[Hook]
Everything in the dark comes to light
Pull up in my car, hop out feeling right
Niggas ain't right let me live my life
Before I pull this pistol out and end your life
She said she wanna have fun, but I wanna have funds
If it's about that money you know I wanna have some
Just seen the judge still ride with guns
Just got some money still gotta get some


{Verse 1]
Just seen the plug so I'm ridin' with pounds
If it's about that money you know I'm down to get down
Just seen mama hit her with 10 thousand
I told her this money go on go ride around
0 to 1000 I'ma make it count
If I gotta go public houses and break it down
[?] see ya with that money they gon take you down
Come out with them pistols up and lay you down
Pull up on your block and knock it down
Where your coke boy? You know my chopper down
I just hit these streets and lock it down
Can't no locksmith unlock it now
[?] party pull up pop it down
These niggas already know how I get down


[Hook]
Everything in the dark comes to light
Pull up in my car, hop out feeling right
Niggas ain't right let me live my life
Before I pull this pistol out and end your life
She said she wanna have fun, but I wanna have funds
If it's about that money you know I wanna have some
Just seen the judge still ride with guns
Just got some money still gotta get some

[Verse 2]
Niggas already know how we come
Them bullets go re run
And then we run
Right to our car
And  we gone
Lets play ping pong
With these ninas
I got 30 in my nina
[?] ring the alarm
And it's full of [?]
Best bitch delete ya
Niggas want a feature
I need 15 bud
You got it then here we come
Blink ya eyes bitch we speeding
I ain't speaking bitch I'm money bleeding
Check out my veins it got money in them
Check out my brain it got nothing in it
I smoke too many loud blunts, I think I'm gon end it

[Hook]
Everything in the dark comes to light
Pull up in my car, hop out feeling right
Niggas ain't right let me live my life
Before I pull this pistol out and end your life
She said she wanna have fun, but I wanna have funds
If it's about that money you know I wanna have some
Just seen the judge still ride with guns
Just got some money still gotta get some
