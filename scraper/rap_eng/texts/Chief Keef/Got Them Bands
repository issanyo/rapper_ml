[Chorus]
She know papa hella rich
Any bitch gone let me hit
Got them bands
Got them bands
She know I got them bands
Got them bands
And I blow it all in France
Italy and Vienna
I'm the mans I'm ballin'
And Kobe I am him
Got Versace on my lens
And a Rollie on my hands
Hit the stand do my dance
She know papa hella rich
Any bitch gone let me hit
Got them bands
Got them bands
She know I got them bands
Got them bands
And I blow it all in France
Italy and Vienna
I'm the mans I'm ballin'
And Kobe I am him
Got Versace on my lens
And a Rollie on my hands
Hit the stand do my dance

[Verse 1]
Them bitches act like fans
Gettin' payed ever since
My daughter's heaven sent
She rock Gucci Louie shit (kay kay)
She be flexin' like a bitch
She know papa got that cash
She know papa hella rich
Any bitch gone let me hit
Your baby's mom let me hit
I just tell her blow all that
Couple stacks don't give me lip
Any bitch gone let me hit
My baby's mom let me hit
I just tell her blow all that
Couple stacks don't give me lip

[Chorus]
She know papa hella rich
Any bitch gone let me hit
Got them bands
Got them bands
She know I got them bands
Got them bands
And I blow it all in France
Italy and Vienna
I'm the mans I'm ballin'
And Kobe I am him
Got Versace on my lens
And a Rollie on my hands
Hit the stand do my dance
She know papa hella rich
Any bitch gone let me hit
Got them bands
Got them bands
She know I got them bands
Got them bands
And I blow it all in France
Italy and Vienna
I'm the mans I'm ballin'
And Kobe I am him
Got Versace on my lens
And a Rollie on my hands
Hit the stand do my dance

[Verse 2]
I'm finessin' countin' bands
Got louie on my pants
I got gucci on my stomach
I got bands don't give a damn
I just splash, I just splash
She know that I just splash
In the mirror do that dance
And you know I'm full of bands
Show that cash in my stash
Bitch I got plenty cash
And he think about robbing me
I'm gone let that semi spazz
You can't stand you won't last
You ain't ballin' like I am
And I stay countin' stacks
I'm ballin' like a gym
Finally rich ain't that a bitch
They gone let a nigga in
Gbe is the mans
And we be setting trends
Finally rich ain't that a bitch
They gone let a nigga in
Gbe is the mans
And we be setting trends

[Chorus]
She know papa hella rich
Any bitch gone let me hit
Got them bands
Got them bands
She know I got them bands
Got them bands
And I blow it all in France
Italy and Vienna
I'm the mans I'm ballin'
And Kobe I am him
Got Versace on my lens
And a Rollie on my hands
Hit the stand do my dance
She know papa hella rich
Any bitch gone let me hit
Got them bands
Got them bands
She know I got them bands
Got them bands
And I blow it all in France
Italy and Vienna
I'm the mans I'm ballin'
And Kobe I am him
Got Versace on my lens
And a Rollie on my hands
Hit the stand do my dance
