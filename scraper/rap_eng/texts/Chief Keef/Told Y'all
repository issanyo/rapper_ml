[Verse 1]
I'm in a new whip, you ain't seen it
Finna hit the sprite with the remix (lean!)
All this fuckin' Fendi, I'm the cleanest
I'm so wavy, make a bitch sea sick
I can only pipe a bitch if she thick
Pistol beat like Bankroll & D. Rich
Two grand on these LV kicks
Couple hundred horse power, eat this
Okay, you niggas wanna sneak diss
Chasin' after money leave me sleepless
Type of nigga fall off for a weak bitch
I took her to the crib, let her eat this
Billie Jean told a bitch to Beat It
Ugh, how she let a nigga beat it
Would've told her she'll make a good parent
Until she swallowed my semen

[Chorus]
I told y'all I was gon' ball
I told y'all I was gon' shit, no stall
I told your girl, I was gon' call
But here her number back 'cause it ain't happen at all
I told y'all I was gonna rock designer
I told y'all I was gonna get them bands
And if you wanna get super fuckin' rich
Then only thing you need to stop fuckin' with is friends
I told y'all I was gonna eat good
I told y'all I was gonna make it out the hood
I told y'all I'ma count big racks
Hop in my lane and I'm grabbin' the wood
Told yall that I got the Mac, Steve Jobs
All this motherfuckin' horse power, yee-haw!
Bitch, I got bigger guns than T.I
He told y'all that I don't, then he lied

[Verse 2]
I just hit this blunt so motherfuckin' hard
Your bitch just jumped in my motherfuckin' car
I'm authentic, you's a motherfuckin' fraud
And my clip is a motherfuckin' large
If I take the pedal in this foreign
Oh can't you tell 'em, I'm ignorant
Used to be slidin' down St. Lawrence
If we catch you lackin' then we scorin'

[Bridge]
Pull up in that all-white like a nazi
Lookin' out for police and paparazzi
This bitch hotter than a Taki
Told her give me that asap, Rocky
Pull up in that all-white like a nazi
Lookin' out for police and paparazzi
This bitch hotter than a Taki
Told her give me that asap, Rocky

[Chorus]
I told y'all I was gon' ball
I told y'all I was gon' shit, no stall
I told your girl I was gon' call
But here her number back 'cause it ain't happen at all
I told y'all I was gonna rock designer
I told y'all I was gonna get them bands
And if you wanna get super fuckin' rich
Then only thing you need to stop fuckin' with is friends
I told y'all I was gonna eat good
I told y'all I was gonna make it out the hood
I told y'all I'ma count big racks
Hop in my lane and I'm grabbin' the wood
Told yall that I got the Mac, Steve Jobs
All this motherfuckin' horse power, yee-haw!
Bitch, I got bigger guns than T.I
He told y'all that I don't, then he lied
