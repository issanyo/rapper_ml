I remember posted on the block
You was sellin' weed, I was sellin' rocks
I was runnin' houses, I was stealin' cars
You was tokin' taurus, I was totin' Glocks
Foe was toting 'Rettas, we was holdin' shots
We was posted on the block until it got dark
We ain't give no fuck about no one
Who would've thought I would be a star tomorrow

[Verse 1]
This shit is gnarly
10 iPhones, iCarly
Bitch named Carly steady callin' me
Gettin' money be my prodigy
Ridin' in this M like it's a Harley
Do you love these hoes? Hardly
Didn't showed up to class, I was tardy
I was posted on the blocky
I was totin' on a glocky
Ready for a opp-y
So I could poppy
Leave his ass on the concrete

[Verse 2]
Who would've though that I would be a star?
Ridin' in 'em cars
Fuckin' on a thot
Living large
'Member posted on Lamron
Pull up on O'Block
Then walk up on the front
Bitch gang, no squad
I 'member going to school on 051
Them fuck niggas opps
Pull up on 'em sendin' shots
Then walk up on St. Law
