[Verse 1]
Pull up flexing on everybody I see
Everybody wanna be like Keef
Everybody don't like Keef
But won't nobody try Keef
Like hookah, smoking Tooka
You smoking fufu, call it G
Bitch, I ain't no fucking Mubu

Guns go blocka

Choppa
Glocks, FNs, and Macs, we going to an opera
Round, shooting niggas down
Where my fuckin crown?
Bitch, I'm King Glo
Tryna copy my style, no Kinkos
I'ma lion from the wild, you a fish, Finding Nemo
Acting like Sub Zero, gon' leave his ass defroze
I'm flexing, niggas pissed
I see you walking, got a pistol
Shoot it at me, you know I'm down
Nigga nigga
I can fuck your sister and your mama, lil nigga
You don't want no drama, lil nigga
Bullets flying like Compton, lil nigga
Choppas go brrocka brrocka, lil nigga
Block guns go bang bang and ping ping
30 shots in this ning ding
Got a 50 and a 40, lil shorty
You ain't got more money than my shorties
I gave some money to my shorties
They gon' come and kill your ass for me
Blah, blah, scah
Pussy nigga, I need an Oscar
I need a Grammy for my grandmama
Flexing on every woman, everybody, let 'em know
I mean, act like they ain't know
Sosa was gonna blow, making big dough
Now I'm with Interscope
Jimmy Iovine, fuck with me though
Chris, fuck with me though

You know how I'm rockin though
Pistols get to popping, hoe
You tell me you love me, stop it hoe
Tryna set me up for my diamonds, hoe
I'ma shoot you right there in your throat
Put this dick down your throat
See your lil dumbass home
You a thot but you thought I was wrong
Wanna glo? Just be like Chief Keef, 'lieve me

Bitch, I'm rockin Herman's peewee
Gold, my necklace look like peepee

[Hook]
Can't trust every face bitch i gotta watch
