[Hook]
One thing for certain
I'ma eagle, not a bird
Believe that, boy, ya heard?
Bitch, that's my word
Nigga, I'm 'bout my word
Pulling up on the curb
Hop out, thots on my nerve
Cops come, hop in and swerve

[Verse 1]
Hop in my car and go skrrt skrrt (Come on)
I be flying like a bird
Thought I was in that red V
Bitch, I was in that Beamer
Remember waiting on the first and the third
Thot top me, know I had to swerve
In my car, right? Smoking reefer
I am up, girl, I'm not no sleeper

[Hook]
One thing for certain
I'ma eagle, not a bird
Believe that, boy, ya heard?
Bitch, that's my word
Nigga, I'm 'bout my word
Pulling up on the curb
Hop out, thots on my nerve
Cops come, hop in and swerve

[Verse 2]
Teachers said I wasn't gon' amount to shit, couldn't believe her
'Cause now I can fuck my teacher
Not a follower, bitch, I'ma leader
Got cash, fuck yo bitch when I see her
Too many blunts, I might have a seizure
She said she selling, I don't wanna see her
Two hundred on this Beamer meter
You know I had to basketball seat her

[Hook]
One thing for certain
I'ma eagle, not a bird
Believe that, boy, ya heard?
Bitch, that's my word
Nigga, I'm 'bout my word
Pulling up on the curb
Hop out, thots on my nerve
Cops come, hop in and swerve
