[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Everywhere I go I spend a lot of cash
Spend them stacks, spend them stacks and get it back
OTF my niggas they invented that (OTF)
Smoking on this loud, call it the stinky pack (dope)
Count so much money that my fingers cramp ('sgetit)
All my niggas wildin’ we don’t give a damn (Looney)
Ask your main bitch she know who I am (Sosa Baby)
Rob him for his taxes if he’s a son of Sam (bang bang)
Who gives a fuck, we don’t care bout nothin’ Fam! (nah, nah, nah)
Got money for a verse, send it through money gram (beep, beep, beep)
I'mma drop the top when I buy me a Phantom
Kidnap this fuck nigga for some ransom
And if his mouth moving, my gun dance some
I pull up in that Porsche, they like "Damn, son!" (skrr)
All these bitches on me, I won’t wife none (nah, nah, nah)
I have them bitches runnin’, when the pipe come, ay

Two door Murcielago and its smoke grey (yeah)
Keep that 50 cal. that bitch come in handy (whoo)

In the barrel, look like a Cambell’s soup can (soup can)
Banana clips in the closet like a fruit stand (haha)
Talkin 36 O’s and I'm the OG (OG)
One time I sit and watch a nigga snort a whole key (damn)
Muzzle on the rock, while it flash it go bang (bang)
Spent a hundred grand one ring, no chain (that's right)
Got em pitchin wild 100‘s, keep it 300 (300)
Man that head so good bought her a 300 (300)
Understand me, nigga understand me?
If thuggin was a catgory I'd win a Grammy
