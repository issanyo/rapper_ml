Sosa where you going? To the money
Runnin' to it, bitch I'm runnin' like I got on cleats
Pull up, stuntin' like I'm going to luncheon
You call my phone, you talkin' a hundred
Million yea, bitch I want it
Baby, I can take you on the island
I ain't talkin' Stony
How you just keep in it floating?
Baby I can buy you a new sew-in
Baby I be pistol toting, got my pistol and you know it
I go too fast, she like boy slow it
I'm like okay baby I'm gone floor it
She like boy that's a hundred mill on the table
I'm like I know it

[Verse]
Jewelry blingin, bitch I show it
They like boy you gettin' bloated
I'm too turnt yeah bitch I'm loaded
And my style this nigga stole it
Choppa come through wrestling Mick Foley
Bitches like oh god I'm gloly
I remember when I ain't have nothin'
I woke up like oh god I'm gloly
There go the damn police
I'm gone get up out here slowly
Baby I got on a Breitling
I could buy you a damn rollie
Cause if I bought hoes anything
I be ballin' now you know it
I done gave yo ass a chance
You done fucked around and blowed it
I get money just as fast as the damn stores did
Ion't need Shaq, I ball like I am Kobe
Ion't need Yao, I ball like I am McGrady
Just call me when you talkin money
Swear I am money brazy
