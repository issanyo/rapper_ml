[Intro: Chief Keef]
Sosa baby
Lou what it do baby
Bang
Go, goooooo, go

[Hook: Chief Keef]
Run up on me you get flat lined
I'm buying AK's and Macs now
I say bitch look at my background
She wanna let me smash now
Fuck nigga we ain't for nothing
Unless we pull up in that foreign
Bitch I'm balling like I'm Jordan
Say we full of ignorance

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Bitch my ice shine so bright
Bitch you need me in yo life
I'm three zero-twice
O-Block bitch 4 life
Say she like me cuz my name ring
I say money ain't a dang thing
I spend it on the same thing
Same Gucci belts, same jeans
Kush smoking I'm in God's turf
Start shooting now that's fireworks
Wrist black that's oil work
Dirty money that's hard work

[Hook]

[Verse 2: King Louie]
Twenty thousand, all hunnits, thumbin through a check
Twenty thousand, all hunnits, thumbin through a check
Twenty thousand, all hunnits, thumbin through a check
Got a hunnit in the auto, leave them ponies wet
Got on shit that ain't out yet
I'm too cool, airy jet
Use your brain it could eject
Bendin up, I gets erect
Throwin' bands on my set
I'm fly as fuck like a jet
Got a bitch from the Jets
Pussy tight and its wet
I'm young, rich and ignorant
Purple mix, kept in and rinse
My life's a movie, so intense
A dead K for the rims
No tints, Supaman flow kid
Goldie bitch I po' pimp
Mack a bitch, then crack her shit
She pop her gum but smack her lips
I spented cash and stack up chips
Get wasted and fuck new chicks
M.O.B until I'm real, pause script

[Hook]
