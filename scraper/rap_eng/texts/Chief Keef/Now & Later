[Intro]
Climbin' up big ass trees
Higher than Jack and the Bean
Bitch, now I'm back poppin' beans
And I ain't mixin' that with the Lean
She got her mind made up
(Mind made up)

[Hook]
I'm gonna hit that now and later
(I'm gonna hit that now and later)
I'm gettin' money now and later
(Now and later)
Shit ain't sweet like now and later
(Now and later)
I be ridin' round town like I'm the mayor
(I'm the mayor)
Ready to get all that paper
(Gotta get all that paper)
I be fuckin' on thots like I'm a player
(Like I'm a player)
Thots when I go to sleep and wake up
(They go to sleep and wake up)

[Bridge]
Thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker
Thot breaker, thot breaker, thot breaker, heart breaker
Thot breaker, thot breaker, heart breaker, thot breaker
Heart breaker, thot breaker
Bitch I'm a heart breaker

[Hook 2]
Now and later, your bitch on the table
Goin' up like elevators, running up escalators
Clubbin' on big ass trees
Higher than Jack and the Bean
Bitch, know I'm back poppin' beans
And I ain't mixin' that with the Lean

[Verse 1]
All I know is go hard, less Tony, more Sosa
Pull up on your block like cockadoodledoo and roosta roosta
Pulled up on your thot and she like God is that you? And I don't know her
But all these bitches love Sosa
And they down to hold the toaster
Grandma saying now and later
I'm about 30 thousand dollar loafers
Boy, get your bitch, she callin'
Better catch your bitch, she fallin'
Had that pussy, yeah, she show me
Cause I'm Almighty Sosa Kobe

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Bout my paper
These bitches keep callin' me, I'm too busy stackin' paper
Plus I got a big booty right in-front of me, motherfuckin' heartbreaker
She ball breaker
Phantom droppin' she know it's Nathan
Meet a new bitch on a daily basis, emoji faces
Girl, give me that open mouth baby, ooh
Ferrari dick drive you crazy, ooh
I know that shit sound crazy
I'm a young nigga, these young bitches pay me
I ain't payin' for the pussy
But I'll put you on retainer
She said that's the same thing, I said no it ain't
I hit it when I want when I come through
Roll up a blunt, tell your girlfriends roll up a blunt
Yeah, all we do is fuck, yeah, all we do is fuck
Few hours later then we wake up and fuck
Gotta king me, Cartier rings on my pinky
I fuck that bitch like she was Pinky
Then I'm gettin' brain on the plane
Jet size with a big flame
Hold your horses, we crossin' borders
Pop a pill, she used to wylin'
Oh shit, I forgot your name again
Was it oh shit? Man I must be drunk again
Never sober
Like a college kid, I'm 24 should be in college, man
But I'm rich as fuck without a college, man
