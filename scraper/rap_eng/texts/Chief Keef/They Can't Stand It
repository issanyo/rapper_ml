[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Riding in the foreign with a bad bitch
She suck the dick like a savage
Diamonds outside the Cartier glasses
I got them racks in my baggage
I got them racks, they can't stand it
Louis bandana, wrapped up like a bandit
I got them racks, they can't stand it
I just might fuck your little bitch in a mansion
They pour up the lean when I landed
I got them racks, they can't stand it
Pull up in foreign, my diamonds dancing
Rockstar like I'm Marilyn Manson
I got them racks, they can't stand it
Louis bandana, wrapped up like a bandit
I got them racks, they can't stand it
I just might fuck your little bitch in a mansion

[Verse 1: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Riding in a drop top foreign
Got a foreign, gon' get me the top when I'm horny
Just popped the seal on the Hitech, we pouring
Made a pineapple Fanta dirty orange
Hold up, wait
Tatted all over my arm
Ice all on my charm
I walk in the club, make it storm
Louis to the head up, Farrakhan
Roll up a baseball bat, Barry Bonds
Turbo OG, smoke all up in my lungs
I fucked that little bitch like a savage, then I'm gone
I got the savages selling and heroin
I like that raw Hitech like the redbone
Good brain, so she got a good head on
Pablo and Sosa, the world in our palms

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Riding in the foreign with a bad bitch
She suck the dick like a savage
Diamonds outside the Cartier glasses
I got them racks in my baggage
I got them racks, they can't stand it
Louis bandana, wrapped up like a bandit
I got them racks, they can't stand it
I just might fuck your little bitch in a mansion
They pour up the lean when I landed
I got them racks, they can't stand it
Pull up in foreign, my diamonds dancing
Rockstar like I'm Marilyn Manson
I got them racks, they can't stand it
Louis bandana, wrapped up like a bandit
I got them racks, they can't stand it
I just might fuck your little bitch in a mansion

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I got some big O's, Ben Frank, big bankrolls
Young niggas riding around big dracos
The pineapple look like a cherry Faygo
And you know I'm down for life like I'm Fabo
And I'm smoking loud packs, so I can't lay low
And I'm pouring up the purple out the rainbow
We don't take L's, we ain't no fucking lame-O's
Throwing up this cheese, get them bitches raincoats
Let's get it

[Chorus: Hoodrich Pablo Juan]
Riding in the foreign with a bad bitch
She suck the dick like a savage
Diamonds outside the Cartier glasses
I got them racks in my baggage
I got them racks, they can't stand it
Louis bandana, wrapped up like a bandit
I got them racks, they can't stand it
I just might fuck your little bitch in a mansion
They pour up the lean when I landed
I got them racks, they can't stand it
Pull up in foreign, my diamonds dancing
Rockstar like I'm Marilyn Manson
I got them racks, they can't stand it
Louis bandana, wrapped up like a bandit
I got them racks, they can't stand it
I just might fuck your little bitch in a mansion
