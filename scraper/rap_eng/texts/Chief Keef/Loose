[Hook: Chief Keef]
I'm toting a big ass bone crusher
Excuse him, he don't know better
Now watch him go through your leather
Like click-clack, we on your schedule
If you knew better, you would do better
I'm getting money now, I used to shoot niggas
Who that in the cut? It's the crew, nigga
They my dawgs, boy, don't make me let 'em loose, nigga

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Don't make me bring my dawgs out the cut with them sticks
I might just pop out the cut with your bitch
I'm up in the club, in the cut with the shits
Rolling whole pounds and I'm pouring whole bricks
I can't talk to you, pussy boy, you's a Narc
Think that you a shark, hit your ass with a dart
Hop up in this foreign, hit your ass with the car
Thinking that you cold, put this heat to your heart
I got King Kong in my blunt
I got Donkey Kong in the trunk
I got Caesar in my backpack
Up this bitch and go grrah

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I'm toting a big ass bone crusher
Excuse him, he don't know better
Now watch him go through your leather
Like click-clack, we on your schedule
If you knew better, you would do better
I'm getting money now, I used to shoot niggas
Who that in the cut? It's the crew, nigga
They my dawgs, boy, don't make me let 'em loose, nigga

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
I love all my dawgs, GBE, bitch, that's the clique
Hop out with that choppa, bitch, you swear I'm with the shits
Niggas flexing, man, they ain't on shit
Ask that nigga, man, I been to fuck his bitch
If you knew better, you would do better 'cause it ain't shit
Niggas tweaking, man, we hit 'em in they shit
Word around the town he run his mouth just like a bitch
(What he is then?) I guess that nigga is a bitch
Better not compare me to him, that nigga ain't on shit
Same nigga, I've been with the shit
I can't switch up, I know what I'm in for with the shit
Excuse all my niggas 'cause all they love is shooting shit

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Who that in the cut? Them my motherfucking dawgs
Hide your credit cards 'cause these niggas fucking frauds
Pussy, go and leap if you feeling like a frog
Cops pull me over, car looking like it's fog
Walk up to the stage and I'm feeling like a champ
No USPS but I'll get any nigga stamped
I'm all about my motherfucking wheat like some Timbs
Disrespect then you get beat like an amp
I got Barney up in my cup
I'm a boss without the tux
I got some dawgs and I let 'em loose
Where the man? I gotta set some rules

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Outro: Chief Keef]
Bone crusher
He don't know better
Go through your leather
If you knew better
I'm getting money now
Who that in the cut? It's the crew, nigga
They my dawgs, boy, don't make me let 'em loose, nigga
