Look at the cherry on my blunt
I flame it up I know you smell the skunk
All this money got me saggin'
Bitch you see my Louis trunks
It's been six years since I smoked a 51
I stuff the Tooka in a cone then I blaze
Iâ€™m sittin on clouds wit Glock, I gave the stars my AK
I'm sipping on Sprite Tequila
Bitch the red be the chase
Is you mad? I see red in your face (Ayeee)

[Verse 1]
Called a tooly, knock off you goofies, so many clips, it's a movie
I'm a rich kid bitch call me Skooly
Sip so much drank, call me Smoothie
Let the doors back to chopper shootin'
That's how my partners doin'
We hold up, turn that shit down then get you some chopper music
So many rocks in by my time, they like boy are you blind?
I call Johnny Dang like why my shit on Alaska time?
God damn I got me a rapid 9
Pro wrapping my 9-5
I got  NFL chopper, he like quarter back to 9
That mean pass it back to folks
100 grand in my mattress hoe
I'm flexing, I got the dough
I should get my mattress a boat
I should get my jewels a room
I should get my shoes a broom
Cause if a nigga step on my shoes, he knows, he doomed

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I see the red in your face, my bad, I was late, I was getting dough
Got red in my drank, got hollows and K, he hit you hoe
Look at my tool, bitch step on my shoes, he wrenchin' hoe
She looking at me, don't talk to Chief Keef, he billing hoes
She know we bang bros, she act like she don't, we blitzin' hoes
Is it Halloween? or it's just Keef, he tricking hoe
She look at my chest, she look at my wrist, she feeling on me
Step out of the car, they like look at his shoes, we gettin' those
I'm done gettin' money, until tomorrow, I'm getting old
This beat from a bitch, that's top from a bitch, you already know
Pull up in that monster, these hoes fall out, I'm killing hoe
I'm riding foreign, I'm from the streets, yes, Chiraq, Drillinois
