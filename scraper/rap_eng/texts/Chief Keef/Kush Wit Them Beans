[Hook]
I’m on that kush with them beans, counting all this green
All us get money bitch, we the money team
We got 40s on our waist, 30s and them things
I’ma let this hammer blow, I ain't worried 'bout a thing
I got all the shells on me, bitch I'm never lonely
I got all this money on me, bitch I'm never hungry
I got all these diamonds on me, yours is whining on me
Say you wanna get like me, keep grinding homie

[Verse 1]
I’ma go to the mall, I’ma buy that bitch
I’ma hop in my 'Rari and I’ma ride that bitch
See my drop sittin' on 4's, can’t ride on no lows
And bitch my pockets on swoll, blow hundreds on my nose
I put Fendi on my belt, Robin all in my jeans
I don't wanna go to sleep, so I don't do that lean
Big knots in my pocket, I don’t carry no wallet
Sneak dissing just stop, and go get you some money
I love bankrolls, I don't love these hoes
Unless y'all one of my bros, keep y'all mouth closed
High off that Earth, I don’t smoke that purp, I don’t smoke that mid
And I don’t smoke that dirt

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got all this kush on me, all these bitches on me
Steady texting my phone, leave me alone please
I'm busy counting this green, all 100s and 50s
They say its dope money, with Slutty Boyz
We the Glory Boyz, all the bitches know me
All the bitches know we
And all these bitches want we
Plus we be throwin' money, we straight stuntin'
Fredo always ballin' then shoot up the party
Bitch I'm on some mikes, cause I don't like them spikes
And I be doing them mollys, I be high as a kite
Come on O'Block and you gone lose yo life
300 for life on the block with the pipes
