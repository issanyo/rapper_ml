Niggas acting like they fuck with me
But I don't trust no nigga, No

Niggas acting like they know me
But I don't trust these niggas

Niggas acting like they kickin' with me
Niggas acting like they fuck with me
But I don't trust these niggas
But I don't trust no nigga

[Verse 1:]
We pull up, click clack whatsup
Hummer trucks and they mounted up
Thots in it, gwuap in it, weed in 'em
Now the cops in it
Shoulda took 'em on a high speed
Fucking with Almighty Keef
I had the Glock in the passenger seat
Ridin' with no license
Ridin' in a 'Rari
Pull up on your pull up, sorry
I gotta go it's early
You ain't talking 'bout no currency

[Hook:]
Niggas acting like they homies
Niggas acting like they know me

But I don't trust no nigga
Niggas acting like they kickin' with me
Niggas acting like they fuck with me
But I don't trust these niggas
But I don't trust no nigga

[Verse 2:]
When I ain't had non'
Where these fucking racks were
I swear that shit so backwoods
I been moving forward
Got racks up in my True'ers
Going on a tour
Probably go to Florida
Cause I fuck with them thugs
And I fuck with the hoes
And I fuck with the fish
I'm a shark in the sea
You diss me you deceased
You deceased it's complete
It's okay it's copy

[Hook:]
Niggas acting like they homies
Niggas acting like they know me

Niggas acting like they kickin' with me
Niggas acting like they fuck with me
But I don't trust these niggas
But I don't trust no nigga
