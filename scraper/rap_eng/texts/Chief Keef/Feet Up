[Hook]
I'ma kick back with my feet up
Need a hundred pounds when I re-up
I'ma sip lean out a tea cup
We looking out at you like we up
Blood gang I'ma put B's up
Cap gang I'ma put C's up
I'ma boolin' in the palace like Caesar
Kicking back with my heat up
Thot just walked in the building
I'm actin' like I don't see her
I'ma get some Gucci slippers
Fuck whenever my feet hurt
Might pop out in a foreign
Might pop out in a Steamer
She let me hit her on the first date, it was nice to meet her

[Verse 1]
I pull up in a boat, so I dap for cruche of monster
Kickin' it with your hoe, I'm t'd up playing soccer
I'm kicking back, eatin' lobster, while yo bitch getting conquered
I'm t'd up, tweakin', got bitches going bonkers
Yo bitch wanna be on my roster, she just tryna get sponsored
She said she wanna eat some gourmet, but I bought that bitch a whopper
Remember I ain't go to school a lot, I never seen my locker
Now it's time to geek up, t up and get ten Oscar's
Nine times you'll get lose finesse he give me the flu
My Jimmy Choo's is true
Got my dog in the back, let him loose
So high I think I can fly, look out use your eyes
Got grinders for the time damn you know they high

[Hook]
I'm kick back with my feet up
Need a hundred pounds when I re-up
I'ma sip lean out a tea cup
We looking out at you like we up
Blood gang I'ma put B's up
Cap gang I'ma put C's up
I'm boolin' in the palace like Caesar
Kicking back with my heat up
Thot just walked in the building
I'm actin' like I don't see her
I'ma get some Gucci slippers
Fuck whenever my feet hurt
Might pop out in a foreign
Might pop out in a Steamer
She let me hit her on the first date, It was nice to meet her
