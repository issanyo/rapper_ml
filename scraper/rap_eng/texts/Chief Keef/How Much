[Intro]
Can I save you boy? I be like "how much?"
If you a opp, we leave you where we found ya
Riding real fast, smokin this Ganja
If they hate me now, can't wait till the summer

[Hook]
That bitch say she like me, I'm like "how much?"
For a verse, they like "how much?"
When I bought this car, they like "how much?"
When I bought this watch, they like "how much?"
When I bought this chain, they like "how much?
When I bought this ring, they like "how much?"
When I bought my earrings, they like "how much?"
They see me walkin' up with my thang, they know how much

[Verse]
Can I save you boy? I be like "how much?"
If you a opp, we leave you where we found yah (true)
Riding real fast, smokin this Ganja
If they hate me now, can't wait till the summer
How you know me? I don't know you
Ballin like I'm Kobe, I dunk on you
On that D-Rose shit, I pull on you
Let me check my Rollie, it's a quarter till two
1017, I be getting Guwap
Disrespect my shooters, shoot at your medulla
I be sippin' lean, catch me in White Castle with Kumar
GloGang, we disturb the peace like Luda

[Hook]
