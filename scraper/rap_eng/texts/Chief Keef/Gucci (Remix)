[Hook/Intro: Edai]
Me and her chilling, riding, smoking, in a two seat
My car got no doors, and two seats
Double g in my belt buckle don’t you know that’s Gucci
All niggas sneak dissing, hating, but it's Gucci
Me and her chilling, riding, smoking, in a two seat
My car got no doors, and two seats

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
My buckle is a beauty, its a cutie, its a Louis
Shawty says she wanna do me because I got a Louis
Smokin' dope till I'm woozy
My life a movie, met me a little cutie, and she got a booty
She grind all on me, she all on my Gucci's
On my face Gucci, on my waist, I got it tatted on me
That means that I'm Gucci
Don’t fuck with fake Gucci, don’t fuck with fake Louis
Me and my bitch jeans, made in Italy
I know niggas sneak dissen', call that frenimies
Me and my bitch jeans, made in Italy
We be spending G's green long like centipedes

[Hook: Chief Keef]
Double G in my belt buckle don’t you know that’s Gucci
All niggas sneak dissing, hating, but it's Gucci
Me and her chilling, riding, smoking, in a two seat
My car got no doors, and two seats
(x2)

[Verse 2: Edai]
Got on Gucci, Louis, Truie
All the bitches wanna do me
She got on Truie
Bad bitch and she bugie
I told the bitch to chew me
She said she don't like the new me, and I don't like the new her
But we both love double g
We can shop and buy double g
I can tell she in love with g's, that's why she's in love with me
She in love with me, cause I be spending g's
I be spending racks, I got plenty cheese
She can't get enough of me, Edai I'm a triple g
Popping pills off triple c's, throwing up the b's
You call a girl, I represent BaldyWorld
I said you call a girl, I represent BaldyWorld
