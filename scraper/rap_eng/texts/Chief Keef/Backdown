[Hook]
These fuck niggas better back down
Act up 30 shoot him back down
I'ma rich nigga thumbing through a sack now
[?] where we at now
I can do it, 40 for a show hoe, bitch you can call me Sosa Mojo Jojo
I don’t care as long as I get dough, hoe
And all the niggas I roll with is gon' blow

[Verse]
I got big Ben Franklin bankrolls, hoe
Walk in the mall and spend it all on clothes, hoe
Fuck it spend 60 on a roro, I ride 44s, we riding on [?]
That nigga upset he ain't got no dumb chicks
And this new bitch I been fucked that
In my pocket a lotta hundreds, I come from the jungle where they be drumming
Got what you signed for up in my closet
I’m finna put some Forgis on a 'rari
Time is money my shit is tocking, throw a [?] we get it popping

[Hook]
These fuck niggas better back down
Act up 30 shoot him back down
I'ma rich nigga thumbing through a sack now
[?] where we at now
I can do it, 40 for a show hoe, bitch you can call me Sosa Mojo Jojo
I don't care as long as I get dough, hoe
And all the niggas I roll with is gon' blow
