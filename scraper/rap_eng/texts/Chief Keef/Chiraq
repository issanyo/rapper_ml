[Intro: Chief Keef]
*clears throat*

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Can't even be in my own hometown
They said that I wouldn't make it out (I made it to Beverly)
My aunty miss her baby
My grandma, that's who raised me
My mommy is my queen, that's an understatement
That's probation, move vacation
Letâ€™s toast to more life and more paper
She don't love you, then replace her, like peace see you later

[Chorus: Jenn Em]
Chiraq, Chiraq
Chiraq, Chiraq, I will come back
Don't lie, don't lie
Don't die, don't die, I will come back to you

[Verse 2: Chief Keef & Jenn Em]
They trying boobie trap you go around
10 toes I'ma stand my ground, if I lean baby hold it down
Used to steal my granny car to ride around
Everybody be like when you coming home?
Tryna get my life straight, I need a comb aye
I've been busy out here on my own, tryna figure out a way to live on
We will let you go

[Chorus 2: Jenn Em]
Chiraq, Chiraq
Chiraq, Chiraq, I will come back
Don't lie, don't lie
Don't lie, don't die, I will come back to you

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Light gettin' at me, like an Oakland Raider
But I'm a player, lady persuader
You a alligator, I'm a tiger
Can't see the vision hand on the bible
I'm a disciple, so I'm forever ridin' (yeah)
If you against me, you're my rival (yeah)
It's people waitin' on my arrival
If you miss a jet, it's gon fly right by you
My daughter told me daddy: "I admire you", aye

[Bridge: Jenn Em]
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Love will come back
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Waitin' on my own, but I keep believin'
Love will come back
Love will come back
Love will come back
Love will come back to you

[Chorus 2: Jenn Em]
Chiraq, Chiraq (Chiraq, Chiraq)
Chiraq, Chiraq, I will come back
Don't lie, don't lie (don't die, don't die)
Don't lie, don't die, I will come back to you

[Outro: Chief Keef & Jenn Em]
When you come home
[?]
She don't love you, then replace her, like peace see you later
Stay mad
