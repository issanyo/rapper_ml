[Intro: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not bout' that life man, catch him in traffic

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not 'bout that life man, catch him in traffic
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action
I lost so many niggas, turned into a savage
And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clap
Where I'm from? This Chiraq, you get left as a tragic
Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic
And where I'm from that's 300, normal spelled backwards

[Verse 1: Lil Reese]
Letting a nigga goon me, I can't imagine
But I'm out here in these streets, catch me in traffic
My niggas shoot for free, they'll let you have it
My niggas do it for me, ain't no way around it
Blood hound for that money, bitch I gotta have it
Going crazy, 20's, 50's, 100's, bitch I'm cashing
And I ain't really with the talking, bitch I'm money stacking
And he ain't really bout' that life, cause he don't love that action
And they don't come from where I come from, they wasn't born a savage
Late night shit, catch him in traffic
I ain't really gotta talk, bitch catch me in traffic
And you know I got it on me, so I'm never lackin'

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not 'bout that life man, catch him in traffic
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action
I lost so many niggas, turned into a savage
And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clap
Where I'm from? This Chiraq, you get left as a tragic
Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic
And where I'm from that's 300, normal spelled backwards

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
We don't really play, homie we about gun action
Pistols get to flappin', ball like the Mavericks
Chief Keef bitch I'm savage, I'm paper stackin'
Pistols get to clappin', niggas get to lappin'
Bad bitches packed up inside a Maxima
That bitch gon' give me neck, neck like a Dracula
Fuck nigga talk shit, delete him, no schedule
That bitch want some ransom, she say I'm handsome
I need me a dancer to come and dance up
On me while I'm wildin' and I'm throwing sets up
I need me a dancer to come and dance up
On me while I'm wildin' and throwing sets up

[Chorus: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not 'bout that life man, catch him in traffic
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we love that action
I lost so many niggas, turned into a savage
And real life, no movie shit, bitch we clap
Where I'm from? This Chiraq, you get left as a tragic
Kicked your bitch to the curb, she was too dramatic
And where I'm from that's 300, normal spelled backwards

[Outro: Lil Reese]
We ain't really with that talking, bitch we 'bout that action
He not bout' that life man, catch him in traffic
