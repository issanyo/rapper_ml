( Verse 2 )

Bitch im hot as a tender
And im a sinner
Furs for the winter
Hand full of millions
Bounced back out the trenches
Im Great but I can be better
Shawty we can't be married yet, Fly like a feather
Yeah bitch im bout my cheddar et cetera , et cetera
Please do not question
I dont like pedestrians
Keep spraying guns like mexicans
Smokin Keisha gettin top by a lesbian
Ain't no CVs in my pendent , these stones inside my pendent

( Chorus )

You not cool boy im cooler
Thanks to my jeweler
I walk in the stores , Shop til' i snore
You tell jokes you a fooler
Got Pistol i'll shoot ya and ima score
Shooting Glocks shooting forward
Walk in the spot like wheres my food? Niggas used to Window Shop

Fuck Iggy i would if i could fuck Brittney i would then
Get all this money i couldn't
Fuck all that i shouldn't
