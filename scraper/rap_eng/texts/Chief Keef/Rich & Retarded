Snippet

[Intro]
Ride around the cities man
(Nard & B)
I'm really sippin' man
I've been trippin' man
Fuck around (?) Glock man
(?) man
(?) man
Really rich man

[Hook: Tadoe + Chief Keef]
I just hit a strip club with a friendly little nigga
V12 under my hood little nigga
Walk up on a bitch like what's good little baby
Baby girl sees and my truck come down baby
You know I'm really rich and retarded, look at the dash
Two trucks behind us, they got a stash
Ridin' around on Beverly, I'm smokin' weed
Turbo, pour a pint of Fanta, I go to sleep

[Verse]
Pour up (?) tickets man
Get into the trash bag man
I don't really accept the man
Y'all been trippin' man
Fuck with (?) Glock man
Fuckin' rocket man
Guap man double up man
(?) really rich man
(?) man
Ridin' away man
(?) when I say it
