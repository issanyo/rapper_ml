The diamonds on my chain is so solid
My niggas ain't scared of nobody
I'm leaning, I feel like an old lady
Capital one like what's in your wallet?
Geekers they geekers all these bitches geekers
A thousand for this lean girl, a thousand for my sneakers
Sneak diss, we'll beat ya, don't care about no female
I'ma go to jail for beating your ass but bitch you gon' go to jail just for retail
Off keisha, fuck Pinger, hello I can't see her
I got so much money right now that I can fuck my teacher Keisha, she geeked up, let me go grab my nina
30 all on my nina, I'ma blow all you guys soon I see ya
Blow him and smoke him, you ain't gonna even know him
This nigga had his high right, so we left him sold out

All these niggas say they know Chief So, Chief Sosa don't know them
Ah no, I don't wanna go, I got so much money in sacks first but that's cause I wanted to
I say ah no, I don't wanna go, I got so much money in sacks first but that's cause I wanted to
Cause I spend so much money, I spend so much money
I get so much money, god dam I get so much money
I gotta roll for money and I will take your damn money
I got love for some knot, but I still got your whole crew money
Balenciagas my sneakers, Jordans make my feet hurt
Boy, you gonna get your damn feelings hurt charging 20k a feature
She a eater with a case on, that bitch can't be my back bone
She think I'ma 90's guy, I'ma do that ass wrong
Let me find out my cash wrong
Let me find out my bank's gone
Let me find out my jewelry gone
And I don't need no jewelry, homie
