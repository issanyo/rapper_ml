Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood

And we still cop 'gars and stuff 'em up with good
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
And we still cop 'gars and stuff 'em up with good, aye

[Verse 1: Marty Mard]
Young ass nigga from these New Orleans streets
All a nigga know is that a nigga gotta eat
Bring me to the table, watch a young nigga feast
Bring me to the booth, watch me unleash the beast
Got the brand new (?), not a stain, not a crease
And if it ain't ten thousand then my fit is not complete
Got a bad bitch checking her reflection in my teeth
She gave me an erection and her mouth is where I skeet
I'ma young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
I pull up in that Rarri then she suck me on the hood
God damn, I'm feeling like this girl she do it good
I may keep her ass around 'til I find a (?)
Megan Fox, (?)
Take your girl, feed the whore
Walked to a billionaire and told the owner I need the store
I got money, I need more
I'm off shows, I need tours
This Marty Mard and Chief Keef
We come (?) niggas bleed more, bitch

[Hook: Marty Mard]
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
And we still cop 'gars and stuff 'em up with good
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
Young ass nigga tryna make it out da hood
And we still cop 'gars and stuff 'em up with good, aye

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I made it out da hood, thank God
My mama made me, so thank her
That cash I made it, so thank I
Aye, where the bank at?
I gotta pick up some cash
Where yo bitch at? Gotta pick up her ass
She top me then I drop her back off
I'ma knock her back off
I just dropped the top
Drop the Glock on the block
So they can bust
They gotta play Keef and, they ain't saying nothing
Remember when I was posted on the block, selling D
Young, catching felonies
Now I get mills
And I get thousands just to chill, you feel me?
They had K9's come and smell
I had weed all up on the chair
And my gun in the armrest
Cops, I can't be no dummy
The opps are tryna come and slump me
Glad I made it out that
But I'll still send my niggas to get you, clout that
Coming where yo house at
You know I'm 'bout that
Getting a lil' money, a fucking a lil' thotties
I'm that nigga, bitch, I'm Almighty
Remember when I was Sosa Baby
Remember when I was Sosa Baby
Remember when I was toting and blowing, baby
Bitch, I wasn't born in the 80's, born in the 90's
Fuck you, pay me
