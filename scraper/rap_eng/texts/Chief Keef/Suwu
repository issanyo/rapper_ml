Posted at Voilà’s with that ten sack
Till I seen a nigga icy, let me get that
Hit up my connect I need a six pack
When I got that, I thought I was rich Jack
Bitch I ain't rich, bitch I'm hood rich
Steel on the Front, hitting hood licks
Engine in the trunk pounds under the hood, bitch
A nigga try to rob me I wish he would, bitch
