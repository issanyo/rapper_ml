[Chorus]
We smoked some dope, I fucked your ho
You wifed that bitch, she love but she gon' go
You like that bitch in the way she like me
She only like me 'cause I'm fucking icy
Ten chains on, I feel like Mr. T
Six rings on, I feel like 23
My gang on my back as you see
Fifty for a show, baby, that be me

[Verse]
That be me
That be me, that can't see
Cause I'm off this tooka pack, all this Tooka thrax
Like Tadoe, I'm just too damn smacked
Bussing everywhere
I'm pointing my nine up everywhere
I got my guys up in here
And they blocking everywhere
Rest in peace Ben Franklin
I swear I need Ben Franklin
I need to keep Ben Franklins
I needa be Ben Franklin
And that's a bill
For the bill you get killed with the steel to your tip-top
(?), got a pint of lean, got it for the zip locks
That's all I need
And we gon' be at it until we scream
Bang

[Chorus]
We smoked some dope, I fucked your ho
You wifed that bitch, she love but she gon' go
You like that bitch in the way she like me
She only like me 'cause I'm fucking icy
Ten chains on, I feel like Mr. T
Six rings on, I feel like 23
My gang on my back as you see
Fifty for a show, baby, that be me
That be me
