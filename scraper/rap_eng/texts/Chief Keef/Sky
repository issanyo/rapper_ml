[Hook: Chief Keef]
I used a bank roll as a fan
All pink faces cuz I can
Smoke so much weed I should buy a land
What's that on them stacks, rubber bands
Well respected worldwide
Went from stealin cars to foreign rides
From 3 flexed in the sky
Dodge the fuckin system, I intend to try

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Haters tellin', ion't know
Gotta be fast, I'm not slow
I just faced a fuckin' 8
Fiend it down and po' a 4
They like, "How you comin' So?"
Order me a bunch of ice
Future on a summer night
Balmain make pajama [?]
Gang shit, fuckin' right
Hellcats, imma slide
Just bumped in someone right
Then she trynna get some tonight
Let a lil nigga have somethin' to say
Imma fuckin' start today
She gon' send her address
Imma tuck the other way
The hotbox got me dazed
Streets got me fuckin' great
The man got a nigga made
My eyes rock expensive shades
These niggas is mini me
Back to back like a parade
Glad I ain't in another cage
Free my niggas up out the cage

[Verse 2: Ballout]
I'm dodgin' potholes in the Lam'
I'm with Sosa, I'm with Tadoe, she got friends
We got passports, we might go to France
Gucci bag, I can't hold these bands
Foreign car, I can't do no ram
We got it and we taxin', Uncle Sam
We got the mansion and the condo and the bands
We got Miami lookin' like the Lam
I'm in the TI ziplock gas wraps around
I'm in the need for speed, watch how I take off the ground
I'm in the TI ziplock gas wraps around
I'm in the need for speed, watch how I take off the ground
