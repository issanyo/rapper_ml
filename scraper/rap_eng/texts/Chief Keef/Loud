Chief Sosa loves smokin' on loud
I'm in my 'Rari smokin' on loud
I hit shawty, she screamin' loud
She loud, she loud, she loud
My boys tote Desert Eagles, they loud
So boy you best watch yo mouth
A hunnit shots, we squeeze 'em, you down
Go BOW!, Go BOW! ,Go BOW!

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I pull off on that bitch, I'm so loud
And what I'm smokin' on, I'm so loud
Shawty know how Sosa get down
Chief Sosa gonna cum in her mouth
Damn boy your pockets so so slim
Man I can be up in that gym
Watch Chief Sosa ball, break the rim
We gots lots of kush, make a sale
I spend all my money on clothes
Never spend my money on hoes
Man I just be stuntin' on hoes
On hoes, on hoes, on hoes

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ballout]
You know me and Chief Sosa off loud
Every time we come to your town
We smoke dope, that's it, smoke off that pound
We got choppas and I swear they so loud
Sneak diss us and we come to your town
Pull up and the 'Rari so loud
All the bad bitches be goin' wild
Every time we come aound
They be like Ballout and Sosa so wild
Is it cause we smoke so much loud
We at the top and bitch we ain't comin' down
Ballout! Ballout! Ballout!
