[Hook]
Glo boy, I been with it since jump street
Right when we was selling D, right there on Front Street
You drunk bitch, what bitch don't want me?
I just had a six some, them hoes was acting country
It's ugly cause that bitch say she love me
Cause I don't like the texting, I don't want no company
I dick her down she like 'Sosa you drugged me'
Told all her friends now them hoes wanna fuck me

[Verse]
Aye, aye I'm bankroll shawty
I got so much money, I bought a bitch to match my 'Rari, Sosa
I'm can't go shawty
A nigga try and rob me he'll be brains blown shawty, oh
I got 2 Glocks .40's
They both got 30's in it
Run up then you shot shawty, oh
And all I ride is 'Raris
But I just bought a Bimmer truck
I'm sittin' on some Forgis
I got the set with me
This shit ain't Aquafina but I got get wet with me
Bitch I got what you need
Is you gone suck my dick and if you not you gotta leave
Cause I'm a cash cow
Bitch I be high off the earth, she hit my weed, she passed out
I'ma laugh now, I know this bitch, I told you bitch can't stand me, sit yo ass down

[Hook]
