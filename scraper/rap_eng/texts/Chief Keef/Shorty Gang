[Hook]
This the shooters song, where my shooters at?
Where your ladders at? Where rulers at?
This the shooters song, where my shooters at?
Where your ladders at? Where rulers at?
This the shooters song, where my shooters at?
Where your ladders at? Where rulers at?
This the shooters song, where my shooters at?
Where your ladders at? Where rulers at?

[Verse]
My shooters call, we'll do your ass
I got this (?) pipe on me, don't make me shoot your ass
Glory Gang, it's the Glory Gang
Smith & Wesson shorty, I'm with the Forty Gang
2-4-14, I'm with the Shorty Gang
Bitch we the Thirty Forty Gang
You ain't gon' shoot shit boy, I know you ain't
And I never snitch, what's my lawyer name?
Don't be trying to run boy, you know you can't
My niggas gonna walk up and blow your brain
Don't be trying to run boy, you know you can't
My niggas gonna walk up and blow your brain
