[Intro]
Tomorrow
'Til tomorrow
(Say a thing) Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow I'ma hit the stu, tomorrow I won't say a thing
Cause there's too many niggas waiting on tomorrow to tell on me

[Hook]
Tomorrow I'ma hit the stu, tomorrow I won't say a thing
Cause there's too many niggas waiting on tomorrow to tell on me
Tomorrow I'ma fuck your bitch, tomorrow I'ma buy a chain
Depends on if you live, you can do a lot of thangs tomorrow
Tomorrow
Niggas got any problems, we will solve 'em
I bought some guns today to shoot tomorrow
Life is all about who tomorrow, tomorrow

[Verse]
I got a bitch named Tamara
Baby, I'ma get some kicks made tomorrow
Niggas be like I ain't bitch made yesterday
To show you that they bitch made tomorrow
I can turn a model to a thot
And I can turn a thot into a martyr
I can have niggas running down your block
I ain't say today, they'll wait until tomorrow
I got a clip full of hollows
And it's long, I be shooting 'til tomorrow
Today is not yours, it's tomorrow's
Cause I might fuck your bitch Tamara

[Hook]
Tomorrow I'ma hit the stu, tomorrow I won't say a thing
Cause there's too many niggas waiting on tomorrow to tell on me
Tomorrow I'ma fuck your bitch, tomorrow I'ma buy a chain
Depends on if you live, you can do a lot of thangs tomorrow
Tomorrow
Niggas got any problems, we will solve 'em
I bought some guns today to shoot tomorrow
Life is all about who tomorrow, tomorrow
