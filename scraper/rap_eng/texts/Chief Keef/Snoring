*Full song hasn't dropped, this is all we have*
[Verse 1]
I'm counting cash, ain't never going to sleep
Jesus help the devils onto me
Smoke so much dope that my lungs are R.I.P
I bring the semi out for murder scene
I [?] up on your bitch and honk the horn
She saw me with this bitch she [?] foreign
Never run up on me, I ain't going
This nina up on my hip leave niggas snoring
I remember selling dope like it was cookies
