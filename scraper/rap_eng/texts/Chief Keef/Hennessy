[Intro]
Sosa on the beat, man
Gang!
Ay! (Gang, Gang!)
Buh!
Turn me up, man (Gang, Gang, u know)
(Tag: Sosa on the beat)

Sipping on this Hennessy (2x)
Sipping on a lot of this lean
Like I am from Tennessee
He is not a friend to me
That band is a friend of me

[Hook]
All the dope
All the hoes
You know I
I got the most
[?]
Act a ho
Flexing with all [?]
I am sick with the shit
You heard the song, you caught a cold
She gets what she likes to fuck she
Make his body flop, yeah I'm Lebron
They at your crib your doorstep knocking (like Muhammad Ali)
Forgis crawling like a newborn
Pull up on your stu and on your ho
Blowing dope
Fuck the [?]
Pull up on your ass and take your lean
And pour a 4

[Verse]
I am making a shot like Joe Johnson
Running through, it's Tommy Jones
Ice cream on my wrist
I swear I need to [?] more
Doing 4 songs in an hour
Shouts out to Big Glo
They like 'Damn, who's that?'
That's that Glo Boy Lil Flash
Walk up in the Glo mansion
With twenty thou in my left
Hop up out the AUDI
In a [?]
I taught you how to finesse, man
Call me Mr. Flip
If he's asking for some smoke
Give him a pack of cigarettes
Glo Gang flexing every day like we're getting rich
I am getting high just like a blunt
Yeah, you know, I'm off the shit
You can never get this dope
It's 500 for a pack

[Hook]
All the dope
All the hoes
You know I
I got the most
[?]
Act a ho
Flexing with all [?]
I am sick with the shit
You heard the song, you caught a cold
[?] bands up in my pocket
No, I cannot use no wallet
She gets what she likes to fuck she
Make his body flop, yeah I'm Lebron
They at your crib your doorstep knocking (like Muhammad Ali)
Forgis crawling like a newborn
Pull up on your stu and on your ho
Blowing dope
Fuck the [?]
Pull up on your ass and take your lean
And pour a 4 (Blood Gang!)

[Outro]
Gang, Gang, Gang, Gang
Sosa on the beat, man
