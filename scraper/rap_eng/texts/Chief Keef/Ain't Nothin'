Been gettin' money since '08 summer, I been riding hunnids
That ain't nothin' That ain't nothin'
I been getting money been spending money boy that's little money
That ain't nothin', That ain't nothin'
Made it out the jects now I'm on a jet
Still throwing up my set
DJ Khaled we the best
With Wop on Bouldercrest
Thats the way show no stress
Thats your bitch she showin' stress
It ain't nothing its a test, nigga

[Verse 1: ]
Pull up in that wet, throwin' up my set
Hot shit you get wet nigga, It ain't none of that nigga
It ain't none of this, what you want with this
You don't war with this where ya boys is
Hit that bank on that Lloyd shit grown boy shit
Pistol knock your ass out it be on that Floyd shit
In my lane bunch of bullshitI can do it
By my pistol I'm a scoot it at your booty
In ya head now your dead nigga
