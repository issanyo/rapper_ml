[Intro]
I know doe, I know doe
Sosa you flexin', babygirl I know doe
It ain't just me girl
She like Sosa you flexin' babygirl I know doe

[Hook]
It ain't just me girl, I'm riding Forgi’s in the snow doe
It ain't just me girl, you know I got my pole too
It ain't just me girl, and I'ma let it blow too
It ain't just me girl, it's just me and Cobra
It ain't just me girl, still slumpin' niggas over
It ain't just me girl, still I'm Almighty Sosa
It ain't just me girl, that's the type of shit you gotta take notes of

[Verse 1]
It ain't just me girl, I'm still pourin' 4’s up
I'm still smoking dope when I'm not suppose to
Put this Glock to ya brain, let it blow
Now I got yo blood, over these Balenciaga's
That I just paid 6 double O fo'
I'm still a smoker cause I hate being sober
I ain't scared of no nigga that can bleed all over me
It's about money then I’ll be all over it
Smoking weed with THC all over it
Boy yo weed got seeds all over it
Like Tony Montana who I trust me
It ain't about money don't talk to me
They shooting for me they walking with me
Come thru lightin' shit up like get in a coffin please
She like you Sosa flexin' babygirl I know doe

[Hook]
