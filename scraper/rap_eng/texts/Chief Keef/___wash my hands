[Hook: Chief Keef]
Flamin' this gas up
Pullin' my pants up
Knew you a fan, though
Runnin' them bands up

Clip hold 30, got a lil nigga [?]
Spend this cash faster than a friend turn foe
As for the flame and the dope, watch the fire rise
You wanna get some money, nigga likewise
I gotta wash my hands
Don't end up on me, it ain't 'bout bands

[Verse: Chief Keef]
Kept up, [?] and lettuce
Gotta grind the dopey, every time I step out
Yessir, we gon' camp out
Make them blocks wavy, like we goin' [?]
Yo hoe up in my Rarri catchin' this vibe
Me and my niggas never switch sides
Big .45 on [?]
You ain't gotta know it's on me to get striped
She feelin' lucky, she singin' the charm
A summer day, oh no, it's snowin'
I'm in that turbo, oh no, it's foreign
She came to the pad, oh no, she's drawn

[Hook: Chief Keef]
Flamin' this gas up
Pullin' my pants up
Knew you a fan, though
Runnin' them bands up

Clip hold 30, got a lil nigga [?]
Spend this cash faster than a friend turn foe
As for the flame and the dope, watch the fire rise
You wanna get some money, nigga likewise
I gotta wash my hands
Don't end up on me, it ain't 'bout bands

[Verse: Bobby Raps]
Uh, yeah, I don't use CashApp, uh, got my cash up, uh
My grandpa's a nice guy, I'm his grandson
Uh, fed up, yeah, no I ain't fed up
I'm just gettin' that gravy, ok, come and catch up

I blow tooka like it's hookah, but I'm not from Lebanon
I just pulled up in that old school drop top, 1991
And I gave you my whole heart, but I'm not the only one
Praise that fire to forget, watch it rise like the sun
Now I'm Charmander, lit up like jack o'lantern
Oh, I have no fear, my heart's a chandelier
You just tried to commandeer, but I still persevere
Keep that iron, I keep that steel
That ain't beef, that shit's veal

All this dirty money in my hands, I need to rinse them
All this purple on me right now, I'm like a Prince fan
That girl gave me brains like a bird, she go hard like the Tinman
I'm in, uh, outer space like I'm on The Jetsons
These boys ain't my sons, ain't even my sons; They're my step-sons
Don't do nothin' foolish, take that L, learn that lesson
Yeah, I go arch-nemesis, turn to Megatron
That's your baby momma? Turn her crib to a traffic stop

I do what I want and I get what I want
I need all the bread, I don't like bread, I like croissants
Hit the club and I'm Rain Man, idiot savant
In the cut, I'm in the spaceship smokin' mids with your mom
Flamin' this gas up
