This bitch be calling my phone
This bitch won't leave me lone
This bitch wanna smoke all my strong
This bitch gotta go home

This bitch think she the shit
So she ain't lie, she like me but I know she is
Baby girl, tricks are for kids
Naww, I don't trust that bitch

[Verse 1]
I don't want it like Tommy, I'm Nesquik with this bitch
I'm about my money, can't mix that with this shit
You about that gunplay, then with that you get hit
We ain't bout that Bombay, go red rum with this shit
What's that backwards? Murder
Got killed for that bitch and all she wanted was further
Hand back, just hit that, told her get back
Then this bitch say she love me, I can dig that

But I act like I ain't heard her
