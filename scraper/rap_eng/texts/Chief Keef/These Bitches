[Intro: Chief Keef (distorted)]
I got hard dick for all these bitches
I get all these numbers I don't call these bitches
No patience for relations kiss my rari bitches
These niggas don't know us we never saw these niggas

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
I got a V12 sittin on rims and I put the bulk back in my Benz
Got a FN with a seatbelt strapped on it cause it's my friend
Breaking bricks down in my den, I got bills stacked to my chin
Diamond Gems cost an M&M, watch so bright cut off a limb
Look at me then look at him, hard top Bentley Bentley rims
Fucked two sisters wet the crib, In a drop top dunk I broke the rims
Back to back bitch call them twins, Got a hard top X and a drop top M, call me iceberg slim can’t fuck with him
2k on weed - hell, that’s a bill, 5k on lean, I'm leaning now
Drunk two whole pints, I'm dreaming now
Your girlfriends a semen demon, Big Guwop she screaming out, drop top Rarri showing cleavage
I'm on Cleveland, call it Believeland
Knocked your bitch didn't need no reason, take my bitch then call it even

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I got hard dick for all these bitches
I get all their numbers I don’t call these bitches
No patience for relations kiss my Rari bitches
Niggas don’t know us, we never saw these niggas
You can hold this 30 out this 40 nigga
You die, you hit forgis - that's on shawty, nigga
We don’t trust these bitches or these niggas
Got the big face Rollies 40 on us niggas

[Verse 2: OJ Da Juiceman]
Nigga tried to knock me off
But these niggas extra soft
How the hell you just start robbing come and try and test a boss
Played the hand that I was dealt,40 make you patty melt
I don’t send no niggas dawg I do that shit by myself
Co-defendant that's a no
Can’t have that shit fly in court
One thing about young juice my
Niggas spied the pussy like a scope
Since you pussy I'ma send these hollow tips down your throat
Killa killer murder murder flip that nigga like a burger
I don’t shoot for legs so you know ain't no attempted murder
And Young Juice man stay with fire
Make me put you on a burner
Smoke you like a cancer stick
Make your momma deal my load
Talking all that tough talk but your ass know you bologna
Born to go to war, man you got me talking like I'm Tony

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I got hard dick for all these bitches

You die, you hit forgis - that's on shawty, nigga
We don’t trust these bitches or these niggas
