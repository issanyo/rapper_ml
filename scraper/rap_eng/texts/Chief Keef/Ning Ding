[Hook : Chief Keef]
I just pour a four in that ning ding
Boy you do some Actavis, boy you on the dream team
The only bitch I know is that nin nin
And that bitch will clap at ya, that want anything
This earth got me looking like a ling ling
Boy don't make me clap at you, I'm with the red beam team
The only thing I know is the green green
Bitch I'm Almighty So, bitch I be the king king

[Verse : Capo GBE]
It's me and Chief Sosa sipping lean lean
Boy you don't sip Actavis, you sip on that green green
The Glo hot, shoot boys out here, burned by ning ding
