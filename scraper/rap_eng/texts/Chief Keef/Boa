[Verse 1]

I just lit a big ass blunt on fire,yeah
I'm who your main bitch admire,yeah
I am a doer your a tryer,yeah
On your bitch first day at work she's fired, yeah
Come get her please boy
She really has to leave boy
I'll make a scene go and get some tea boy
Meanwhile the dope I'm smoking really gotta  [?] boy
I smoke so much dope you would think I was a crack head
Only sipping on the purple ghost off of Pac-Man
Come through with an axe I'm the lumber jack man
I got more ink guns than a fucking tatt man
I pop more rubberbands than a fucking bank do
I might take my Fendi belt off and spank you
I got real guns couldn't tell you what a blank do
Put your pussy ass on a corner and slang you
Damn, I think they sipping on that I hate you juice
If you was me and I was you then I would hate you too
Smack the shit out you and
