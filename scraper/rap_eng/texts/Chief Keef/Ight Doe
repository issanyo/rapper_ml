This ho actin' like she don't wanna let me fuck, Ight doe

[Verse 1]
Smoke a 3 gram blunt to the face, ho
And a 50 shot came with my chain, ho
A yellow envelope came with my bankroll
I'm flexin' on this bitch, I think that her shit stank, though
I don't drink liquor but I sip lean, though
Bitch I payed 600 for this pint, though
I got 30 shots in my thing, though
If this nigga want my gun to glo up, ight though
You say CDAI got 22 shots but he really got Michael
Come through shootin' and I'm shootin' so fast givin' any nigga lypo
Someone took his money from him

Lil nigga try to take my banger from me

Let the bitch try to set me up, I got my pipe close

But you don't need to be lookin' for me, you need to find your ho
She steady askin' me where I'm at, she tryna come find me, though
Run through a 50 thousand dollar bankroll
'Member when I use to ain't get allowance though
Cause I ain't never wanna do none of the chores
Now I pay maid a to do all the chores
I don't want that bitch, she been around like revolvin' doors
And I don't trust these niggas as far as I can throw em
