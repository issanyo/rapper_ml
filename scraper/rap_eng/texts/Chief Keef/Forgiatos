[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I be getting dough, fucking all these hoes
And I can tell my number but why you don't call me though
I say bitch I'm in my glory, stunting on all these hoes
Now can I get some head while I'm leaning off a 4
See these niggas they be mad, they hoes glad they saw me though
And we don't do no pass, I'll pass you in 'raris though
See these bitches they be going cause I got all the dough
I pull up in that foreign Beamer game Forgiatos

[Verse 1: Ballout]
I be getting money, counting so much damn money
Counted up a 150,000 last Sunday
Then I went to the strip club that Monday
Made it rain all night, all I threw was 100s
They like "Ballout, you getting too much damn money"
Never too much, I got too much damn money
Pulled up on them 40s, had them hoes going donkeys
I don't trust these hoes, I don't fuck em with no condom
I don't trust these hoes, I just fuck 'em then I dump 'em
Leanin' off this act got people talking 'bout my stomach
Fresh as hell make a hood bitch straight vomit
Still in the hood riding Forgiatos bitch stunting

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I be getting dough, fucking all these hoes
And I can tell my number but why you don't call me though
I say bitch I'm in my glory, stunting on all these hoes
Now can I get some head while I'm leaning off a 4
See these niggas they be mad, they hoes glad they saw me though
And we don't do no pass, I'll pass you in 'raris though
See these bitches they be going cause I got all the dough
I pull up in that foreign Beamer game Forgiatos

[Verse 2: Capo]
I pull up in that foreign Beamer game Forgiatos
And, I get so much dough, I got it off of you, it's slow
And, you can't get no money, you dark and I do the glo
And, yeah we cocky arrogant, reggie man let them hammers spit
All these bitches going, don't want them no more, ain't none to pick
2 cell phones and [?] you promise you still won't call a bitch
All these niggas rapping for out the sky checks, man that's some shit
When I'm at the top we the Glo Gang, then us take on yo' bitch
And we ride with tech macs and .30s, left hand all type shit
And we cocky, arrogant reggie man let them hammers spit

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
I be getting dough, fucking all these hoes
And I can tell my number but why you don't call me though
I say bitch I'm in my glory, stunting on all these hoes
Now can I get some head while I'm leaning off a 4
See these niggas they be mad, they hoes glad they saw me though
And we don't do no pass, I'll pass you in 'raris though
See these bitches they be going cause I got all the dough
I pull up in that foreign Beamer game Forgiatos
