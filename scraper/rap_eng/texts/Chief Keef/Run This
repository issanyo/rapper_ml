[Intro]

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I'mma run this shit 'til my feet hurt
I'mma run this shit 'til my knees hurt
I'mma run this shit 'til my chest hurt
Sosa watcha smoking on
That work, yes sir
I'm just tryna see a nigga's worth
Pull up in my foreign, that bitch go 'skkrt'
Run up on So you gon' get put in the dirt
He gon' blow, but Nero gonna shoot first, yes sir

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I came through stunin', came through ballin'
And that motherfucker wants [?]

But don't be stalling, if you're stalling bitch I won't be calling
I love chasing after guap, bitch I'm Meek Marlin, Meek Millin' with this [?] straight ballin' [?]
