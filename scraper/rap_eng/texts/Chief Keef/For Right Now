[Hook]
I just wanna fuck for right now
I can't show you love, not right now
I’ma flame this bud up right now
Push come to shove, not right now
I ain't tryna talk for right now
I'm just tryna ball for right now
Stay away from the law for right now
You just got to kill them with kindness

[Verse: 1]
For right now I can use me some breakfast
Came a long way from 8 section
Got a lot of bottles in the section
And a lot of diamonds in the necklace
Throwing cash up like "bitch catch this"
Bitches so sweet, I can use a dentist
Kick the cash door down of the hinges
For right now I can use me a pen
For right now girl I’m in my air and in my air
I am not a superhero, I can not save
That shit that he flamed up, it smell like sage
She let me smash hit her with that one two three, Johnny Cage
Bang bang

[Hook]
I just wanna fuck for right now
I can't show you love, not right now
I'ma flame this bud up right now
Push come to shove, not right now
I ain't tryna talk for right now
I'm just tryna ball for right now
Stay away from the law for right now
You just got to kill them with kindness
