[Intro:]
Bang baaaaannng
Ha ha ha, I know man I'm just tweaking
Bitch let's have a chopper party
Bang bang bang kamikaze

[Hook]
Bitch let's have a chopper party
It's a movie and them choppers staring
Produced by Uzi and them Glocks and Carbons
Bang Bang, kamikaze
I bought a watch it cost a Maserati
I bought a car it cost a fucking mansion
It go skrrt skrrt and it scuff the driveway
I'm a young rich lucky bastard

[Verse 1]
Baby I ain't have no father
I only had my mother
They say that mothers raise soldiers
Well my momma raised Almighty
Remember when I was best friends with Byron
Now I'm best friends with Ben Franklin
I know you see my wrist dancing
Turn off the lights, now my wrist complaining
My choppa got tourettes
It's steady screaming out this and that
Shooting for your neck and your head
Like, who next?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
You know I'm always glowing
I even got my bitch glowing
She ain't getting no cash, doughing
That bitch just got IG famous on em
I had my choppa snoring
Now you got my choppa roaring
Try to drive-by, that shit not so smart and
Now my niggas shot up your car and
Now you got your face on a carton
And now your name is your block and
I got all my ice, I won't tuck it
Niggas don't wanna get killed in public
Like, welcome to the opera
Meet Ms. Choppper-a
If you got a fucking problem with us
She gone chop you up
Im still bussing like a Dillinger, but I'm on my childish stuff
They be cuffing like a officer, Chief Keef won't lock you up
Cause who gone hold me down? my chopper
Baby I'm still running from them coppers
I'm still screaming fuck the oppers
Spot 'em got 'em then I drop 'em

[Hook]
