[Verse]
Where Ya ass was at, when we was climbing across the gates
Where Ya ass was at, when we was in the grass waiting
Where Ya ass was at then?, Now you here today
Where Ya ass was at, when the hood was going crazy
Where Ya ass was at? Ion care, Ion Know
Where the cash at, I'm coming to get it y'all know
Where Ya ass was at, couldn't see ya went ghost
Where Ya ass was at, when we was giving smoke
Where Ya ass was at, when we was posted on front
Where Ya ass was at, when we was on Lamron
Where Ya ass was at, when we ain't have a job
Where Ya ass was at, when all my niggas had to rob?
Where Ya ass was at, like i was looking for ya
Where Ya ass was at, i grab the TEC and bring it to ya
On that mob shit, finna cut ya dick and feed it to ya
Got a scope up on the choppa, it look up and see the fools
Where Ya ass was at, when grandma drove a school bus
Where Ya ass was at, when mama was a booster
Where Ya ass was at, when pops was a loser
Where Ya ass was at, when my teacher said i couldn't do shit
Where Ya ass was at, when i was stealing
Where Ya ass was at, when i was drilling
Pull up in a foreign, off pilling
I count the cash, to get my mind off drilling
Where Ya ass was at, when we was in the streets
It hit like a possum, running threw the streets
Where Ya ass was at, when we was taking D money
Make ya bitch say 'Oh My God', Cause i get OMG money
Rockaflia, PPV money
Where Ya ass was at, when i was starting phenoms
Only time you ball, its like hair on LeBron
Where Ya ass was at, when they was giving me time
Where Ya ass was at, when i was using coupons
Where Ya ass was at, when we made his whole crew run
Where Ya ass was at, like i was searching
You can get 45 shots, 5 Curtis' (Bang!)
Where Ya ass was at, when i was using the same sheets
Coming back with all that Sosa, boy we want the same streets
Im coming to get a billion, you gotta change streets
It ain't matter when i been, its where i ain't be
It ain't matter when i been, its where i ain't be
Im legally blind, bitch i can't see
Im legally blind, bitch i can't see
Bang!, Bang Bang!
