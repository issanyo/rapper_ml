[Intro]
S-O-R-R-Y, the number 4, or F-O-R, W-E-I-G-H-T bitch

[Hook]
Double cup me please
Your bitch hit me like "fuck me please"
She say she love me, she like "love me please"
My response was "suck me please"
Please, please, give me a lighter please
I just rolled a blunt, give me a fire please
Please, please, run up on me
I got 50 in the thing, won't hesitate to let it speak

[Verse 1]
Choppa presidential, come through, give a speech
Gang on my fuckin' back, runnin' hurt my feet
Where the restroom, cause my chain gotta pee
Call my Sosa Wonder I'm gettin' money and I ain't gotta see
Still locked out, I ain't gotta leave
Bitch came gave me top now she gotta leave
My gun got no limit like I'm Master P
When you callin' my phone speakin' crazy cops tappin' me
Gotta be lowkey, cause the cops after me
Smokin' on the loudest weed, K-9 dogs after me
You say you gon' be at the top, ha, long after me
I'm Sorry 4 The Weight, I was somewhere chiefin' keef

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
This be that Sorry 4 The Weight
