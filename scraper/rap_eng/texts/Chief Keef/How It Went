I be smoking piss You be smoking shit
I be spending money, you do not spend shit
My jewelry look like piss, baby I'm the shit
Walk up court like fuck the judge, tell him suck my dick
I'm a young nigga with cannons like I'm Nick
Tell that bitch to put me out, I'm a fire bitch, I'm lit
Rolling with the clique don't make 'em have a fit
Click clack bang bang, that is how it went

I be back to get weed that is where I went
I ain't on M.E.A.D., niggas got me bent
Rolling in that thing, corners bitch I been
The freshest thing on the corner, bitch I'm it
Nigga I don't want a order it don't sent
You ain't talking making money it don't make no sense
Sosa Rover landlorder, where my rent?
I can't do nothing but keep growing cause I’m a plant
Trying to make some money bitch I got a plan
They wanna shoot some guns well bitch then I'm they man
Already popping Glocks and I just fucking landed
And I hate losing bitch I'm just fucking winning

[Hook]

Walk up in court reeking, reeking like a fucking Puerto Rican
My bitch bad, she's a Puerto Rican
But I switch hoes like I switch coats every season
Hop up in my car and I'm fleeing
Hoes buggin me these hoes some flees and
I be riding round spending G's and
A big ass mansion by myself I sleep in
You'll get word from me that's what I told your honor
Don't lock me up I'll give your ass a dollar
Air Force 1’s, I don't wear no Prada
I'm just getting money I ain't have no father
I'll rob a nigga fo' I get money
I gotta watch out for these crocodile dundees
Married to money with children, bitch I'm Al Bundy
Smoking on this skunky pack, your shit is not funky, dummie
