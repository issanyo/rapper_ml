[Verse]
You ain't bout' that life, [?]
See your bitch in the club she like hug me back
Got lazy in the gat, she like fuck me back
Get the [?] home, but they brought me back
I ain't wait for bitch to love me back
Bitch I ain't gonna lie, like call me back
So I eat too much, bitch call me fat
Ten fat at the light and I wrap it up
In a muscle car like I'm flexing up
Ohh, she's boring
Yawing on her like I'm just getting up
Take a nigga shirt and rip it up
Take a bitch spirit and lift it up
The K was the axe how I hooked it up
Then the K was the box how I lifted it up
Bang

[Hook]
Catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up (bang)
Catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up (bang)
Catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up (bang)
Catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up (bang)

[Verse 2]

[Hook]
Catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up (bang)
Catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up (bang)
Catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up (bang)
Catch up, catch up, catch up, catch up (bang)
