[Intro]
Flexing, they know flexing (beep, beep, beep)

[Hook]
Niggas know I'm flexing, they know I'm flexing
I'm buying all these clothes cause I'm straight finessing
Smoking kush blunts and let's start a session
End it in a second, it's gon' get reckless
Pop a couple X's and sip some Texas
I just love my money, it's straight fuck my exs
Smoking turn me up, I hate feeling regular
I'm thumbing through that check cause I'm straight finessing

[Verse 1]
On these hoes I'm flexing, they know I'm flexing
I'm flexing on these hoes that thought I was nothing
Now that I'm something, these hoes coming
I'm smoking on that Compton, I'm holding hundreds
Gucci on my face, Louie on my belt
Trues and expensive shoes, man I need some help
Man, I love my money with her conceited self
I'm giving flexing classes if you need some help
I got it all from nothing, them commas coming
If a nigga play, put the choppas on him
I got it all from nothing, them commas coming
I give a bitch nothing, that's why I love her

[Hook]
