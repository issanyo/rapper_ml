[Hook]
Bet me, I got 10 stacks, nigga
You trippin´, I got them racks, nigga
Come to my house, the gang gotta pat niggas
Down, the gang love to wack niggas
Mmm, mmm, Chief Sosa love to slap bitches
Let's get it done, Chief Sosa love to wrap shit up
The green I love, I don't care about no black nigga
Or no white niggas, skinny nigga, fat nigga

[Verse 1]
You saw me walk up with the fuckin' racks, right?
Flamin' hotter nigga, bitch it's snack time
Gummybear a nigga just like trolly
I'm in the choppers gettin' head by lelonnie
She said you fucked my friend, why you try me?
She said she ain't a thot, I´m like bitch don't lie to me
Bitch I ain't a bed, you can't lie on me
I fuck around and leave ya, don't rely on me
I got hella guns, right now they tweakin'
Gotta wake 'em up, right now they sleepin'
I got hella cash and she want me to throw it
He say he got cash but I want him to show it

[Hook]
Bet me, I got 10 stacks, nigga
You trippin´, I got them racks, nigga
Come to my house, the gang gotta pat niggas

Mmm, mmm, Chief Sosa love to slap bitches
Let's get it done, Chief Sosa love to wrap shit up
The green I love , I don't care about no black nigga

[Verse 2]
I don't care about you lil´ too boys

[Hook]

Mmm, mmm, Chief Sosa love to slap bitches
Let's get it done, Chief Sosa love to wrap shit up
The green I love , I don't care about no black nigga
Or no white nigga, skinny nigga, fat nigga
