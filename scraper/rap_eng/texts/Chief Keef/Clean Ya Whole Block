40's with the 30's
We'll clean ya whole block out
Got block boys we on top now
Now we can't fuckin' stop now
[x4]

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Forties, Fifties, Hundreds, we'll clean ya whole block out
300 we pop out
Pop out bullets, pop out
I been gettin' cash
She say she love me, bitch stop now
All up on my cock now
Cause I am at the top now
I'm rollin', off a triple stack
Talkin' money lemme get to that
Smoke a nigga like a cigarette
Bullets surf like the internet
I'm so at the top, I can't even see
Now it seem like no more bad bitches wanna be with me
OTF nigga, bitch, I'll be with weed
I got that bitch so high that she can't even see
I'm at the top, nigga catch up
Hundred round drums spray, leave a wet opp

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jigg]
Now 40's with them 30's means we'll clean your fuckin' block out
To rock all the opps out
They know when a opp out
Soon, all that money cars, you know that I'm out
Step right out the door, cause your mama stack in my mouth
My mouth..
And this shit is serious
Feds movin' fast, fast like Fast and Furious
300 and Block Boyz, nigga we clear
40 hit your ass, and the doctor can't cure
Welcome to the ??? boy, we do that shit fierce
Don't fuck with bang niggas
Them niggas on they period
Shootin' anything lookin' curious
After all, we do that shit fierce, fierce...
