[Hook]
Even though you're dead and gone
I won't let you fade away
I promise I will never change
I will see your soul one day
I think about you everyday
I know you're in a better place
I think about you everyday
I know you're in a better place

[Verse 1]
RIP Keta
I miss you a lot
With WIc City
She was from the block
God took her on his own
Luckily she ain't get popped
Keta ass was hard
Hard like a rock
Shout out to Teresa
And her three little brothers
Two big sisters
And [?] was her lover
I dream big
So I put my head under covers
With Wic City
We some crazy mothafuckers
Have you ever head the saying
That say good die young?
Keta went to college
And shawty ass could run
Keta World crazy
Shawty we ain't done
And she was bright
Real bright like the sun
Everybody's dying
It's starting to be my issue
Now Keta in the sky
Seeing white like some tissue
RIP Keta
Girl I never will forget you
It's your boy Chief Keef
Real clear no pixels

[Hook]
Even though you're dead and gone
I won't let you fade away
I promise I will never change
I will see your soul one day
I think about you everyday
I know you're in a better place
I think about you everyday
I know you're in a better place

[Verse 2]
Boom boom to the moon
RIP Bebe
I wish you was alive
Copy that mayday
When I say dead and gone
I mean dead and away
In a better place
Fed out but hey hey
The whole block miss you
Double L 'nem got you
Coming from Chief Keef
We won't forget about you
We won't forget about you
You are [?] everyday
I kept it in my mind
[?] in every way
Disrespect Bebe
And you can get Wic stomped
Calumet whooped
So tell me which one
You can get help from ransom
From money you ain't got
I'm still here to rap and get money
And thank God Bebe was tight
Something like a tank top
My nigga Bebe is the only thing I ain't got
Missing Bebe I ain't talking what's not
Keta World,  [?]
I gotta take it to the block

[Hook]
Even though you're dead and gone
I won't let you fade away
I promise I will never change
I will see your soul one day
I think about you everyday
I know you're in a better place
I think about you everyday
I know you're in a better place

[Verse 3]
Big broski moski
RIP LIl Tenz
Lamron  crazy A
Nd all was his lil mans
I wish he was here
To show sixteen with his hands
Damn moski broski
He had a lot of mans
Fuck them pussy niggas
Who ever did it to folks
He was bout that money
[?] us get it and go
He started off a mogul
Destined to be bro
I got a lot to say
But shit I don't even know
I know he's our mans
I know that he was cool
He was bout that dough
And he wasn't scared to hold a tool
Yeah it's fucked up
God took him for a reason
Lamron was beefin
And it was war season
Disrespect folks
And I'ma start treating
Bang bang bitch
Yeah I'm hotter than some heat
And RIP Lil Tenz
I did this song for a reason
Moski in my heart
Straight up no tweaking

[Hook]
Even though you're dead and gone
I won't let you fade away
I promise I will never change
I will see your soul one day
I think about you everyday
I know you're in a better place
I think about you everyday
I know you're in a better place

[Outro]
