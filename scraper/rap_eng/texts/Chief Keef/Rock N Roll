[HOOK]
She think we go together she my friend
She wanna roll with me so she hop in
She like "Almighty can i see them bands"
Babygirl yo ass tripping
You said you wanna fucking house key
But you a lil thot please
Stop talking to me like im slow
Bitch you know how i roll n rock

[Verse 1]

Gotta have them bankrolls
Just in case the bank close
And I gotta change clothes
I spilled ashes on my clothes
I spilled lean in my car
Driving so fucking hard
Put the petal to the floor
You gone hear this motherfucker screaming roar
Me and money i can't take none of yall
I beat her up she thought i was cheating y'all
That ain't my baby, girl we going to maury dog
Fake the DNA test, i paid maury Ten thou

[Hook]
