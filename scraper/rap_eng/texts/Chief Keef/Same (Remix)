[Intro]
My bitches thought my number was the same
In Gucci coat dancing in the rain
She say she want some I want the same
She know I be passing 50's out this change
My bitches thought my number was the same
In Gucci coat dancing in the rain

[Hook]
She know I be passing 50's while be passing 50's
She know I be passing 50's while be passing 50's
She know I be passing 50's while be passing 50's
She know I be passing 50's while be passing 50's
I changed
So I changed? No
I changed
So I changed? No
The same shit
On the same shit

[Bridge]
In Gucci coat dancing in the rain
Chopper, what now?
Let me cool down I got my gun hot
Your lil baby is a lollipop
Say that's my baby - I did not

[Hook]
She know I be passing 50's while be passing 50's
She know I be passing 50's while be passing 50's
She know I be passing 50's while be passing 50's
She know I be passing 50's while be passing 50's
I changed
So I changed? No
I changed
So I changed? No
The same shit
On the same shit
