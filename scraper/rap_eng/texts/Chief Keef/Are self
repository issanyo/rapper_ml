Baby it's just you and me, lets take are time in the shower babe
We don't need to fight, we can watch movies all night
From blue ray to h d, we in a room with the lights cutoff
I want to make love to you, hold you tight and make you feel special too
Want to get naughty well turn on the radio lets jam to something old
My finger tips running all on your body it kinda smooth just take off that top let me see something smooth about you
Gripping on you so fast trying not let go
My heart  beating at a 101 tasting your fumes as we getting in the bed
What hold up let me slip on this rubber just to test it out on you
I want to do something freaky to you
Don't let me go just gold on to me as we making sweet passionate
Love
Your body so new to this o why you got twerk with it you know i love your body when you drop it low for me keep hoping till you finish baby
