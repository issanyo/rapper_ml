[Intro]
I can't trust a soul, I ride wit' tooly
I swear that it's glued to me
Catch a fuck nigga run up tryna do me
I'm a get to fucking shooting
I got a Glock, that bitch hot, (?)
Niggas really mad cause I done made it
And I get paper, they can't get nothin'
Cross me, bitch, see you later

[Verse]
That nigga crossed me, he gon' need God
Run up on 4-O-6 and heat they block
But they ain't out there, we don't never see them
Bitch, my .45 wanna meet them
But I'm rich, let me T them cause I'm T'd up off reefer
I still feel this flat, but I just pop two Xanax
This that Xanax music, this that flat music
This that go-and-get-your-gat music
This that get-it-cracking music
This for my white boys that be goin' hard
Fucking thots like pornstars, smokin' on that dope
We don't smoke that fuckin' bubblegum, organic kind of cookies
Bitch, I don't want no pussy, I want top
Tommy that'll leave your (?), go by
Where the fuck he came from?
You know what my name was, my name is Almighty
And I'm hard 'bout it, I ain't scared of nobody
My gun don't fear nobody
Let her blow my gun, don't hear nobody or see nobody
But it'd hear somebody's, shoot your ear off, buddy
Meet my little friend, his name is Tommy
I don't snort coke or do molly, I don't sniff dope
I do nothin' but smoke trees
I just get high, get high 'til I damn die
Niggas hatin' on me, I don't know why
But you know I got my .45
Tadoe got the .40, get up off a flat, Remy and Patr√≥n though
And he at your door 'causing comotion
Knockin' shit over and down, blowin' down your tree
Blowin' down your kitchen, blowin' down your knees
And he blowin' down your feet and your top
I bet do death he'll not, where your pounds and your bars?
And your bricks? Where your bitch?
So I can fuck her and make her tell me shit?
Why? Cause I got (?) dick, she suckin' on this dick
Guess what? She lovin' on this dick
