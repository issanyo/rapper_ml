[Hook:]
My leather so soft, my gun is so hard
Cock this mothafucka back and shoot his ass in broad day
He layin on the ground, they like oh God
Glo came through and started stomping on the yard
We got Glocks and chops, start poppin on the yard
You ain't jump off the porch, you just jumped out the yard
That money money, throw it to me, throw it 100 yards
I’m a wide receiver, catch it, I'm a Randy Moss

[Verse 1:]
I be catching everything, I think I’m Randy Moss
Threw that cash like wedding rice, that bitch she Randy Moss'd it
She said that she want some kids, opened her mouth she caught it
Pull up on em, niggas flexin, like my car flossin
I ain’t gone matte it, I think that  I’ma gloss it
Almighty So a captain, I don’t think that I’m a boss bitch
Spent some racks at saks fifth, the queen she Randy Moss'd it
I could be runnin backwards, I still Randy Moss shit
I’m ridin' in that Randy, Big Glo, boss shit
& I get my semi, nigga talk shit
You can keep on runnin', bullets Randy Moss'n
Cause I got my gun and you teach me what I taught you

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I don't hoop bitch, I play football
Glo on who bitch? I make lil talk
& I got a big gun for lil boss
This a Randy Moss this ain’t no damn revolver
Catch his ass, mothafuckin hollow
They gone wet yo ass, mothafucka swallow
Get ya ass, mothafucka run ho
Run up done up run up then you’re done ho
He ain’t talkin money, he can’t even approach
I’m a fuckin viking just like Randy Moss
That bitch patriotic, just like Randy Moss
Cause I been gettin guappy since like '84

[Hook:]
