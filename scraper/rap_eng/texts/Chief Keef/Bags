I got 10 niggas out here that's gon blast for my ass
I got 10 shooters on the front and on the rooftop
I got 10 traps and them bitches movin' nonstop

[Verse 1: Chief Keef & Fredo Santana]
I got trash bags full of money, ay
I got mad bags full of money, ay
I got glad bags full of money, ay
Don't get mad, go and get some money, ay
I pity the fool that go against me, ay
So much ice, thought I was Mr. T, ay
GBE the new Cash Money, Bling Bling
Hunnid pints on the dresser, I'm a fiend
I don't wanna focus, get up on yo knees
Finna pour a four then take my ass to sleep
Don't need no cosign, bitch I'm certified in the streets
And I don't go nowhere without my fuckin' heat

Everywhere that I go, it's a shootin'
