[Verse 1]
I'm sitting in my lamb, smokin' palm trees
Girl you be stunting, you can get about me
I gotta hit the mall, bitch I like to stunt
And I gotta get high so number two up on the blunt
And them bitches scream "Musubi", everywhere we go
And I'm Chief Keef shawty
Yes I get alot of hoes

[Hook]
And girl you know, I gotta get some doe
I gotta hit a stain, I can't walk around broke
Man I'm in a daze, sippin' on lean
On my way to get some cash
Shawty gone for the the team

[Verse 2]
Where I'm from, we get it, get it in
And I'm 9 to 5 shawty, while you niggas minute men
She say she dig my steelo but bitch I'm in a rush
And I got five niggas, so bitch you finna bust
Lil Tony about that mula, I love him with my heart
He too busy finding Nemo, while I'm swimmin' with the shark
I'm livin' in the dark, my mind is a slave
If you disrespect the Wic, all you hear is bang bang

[Hook]

(Verse 3)
Feeling ? cause I ain't feeling shit
Chief Keef motherfucka and my niggas feeling it
And my music got the bitches steady rockin'
If a nigga talking shit we can get it fitted poppin'
She did me like I'm famous, saw them  bitches wavin'
If a nigga try to touch me, crossed his ass like amen
F-L-Y, haters screamin' "Ah man."
Guys just poked the bud got my niggas ballin''

(Hook)
