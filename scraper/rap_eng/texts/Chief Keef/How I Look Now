[Intro]
'Member postin' up on the block man, totin' Glocks man
Out there in the field, while niggas getting dropped man
Aye

[Hook]
Been sellin' crack, been about that sack
Bottom to the top, nigga I did that
Remember askin' momma, lemme get some cash, nigga
Six hundred dollar Balenciagas,  I did that nigga
We don't know [?], I look back nigga
Swear that dope so good, they like that I cook that nigga
Got up on my hip, cash in my bookbag nigga
What I ain't, I'll never be, tell me how I look now nigga

[Verse 1]
Cash in pocket, nigga fuck a wallet
My debit card my credit card, both got deposits
Flexin' be my hobby, flexin' in the lobby
Ridin' round in 'Raris, pulled up to the party
Pullin' up in Beamers, seats color Bacardi
I ride around a Audi, fuck a Maserati
.40 in the party, please don't tell nobody
Tadoe got the shotty, off the shots we call it
Woah Kemosabe, pocket full of money
Head full of dreams, all of 'em gettin' accomplished
I love the smell of laundry, I love the smell of money
3D like a Sony, and I'm also sunny

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm ridin' in a Tonka, you ridin' in a Honda
I still claim 300, bitch that's where I come from
Niggas can't tell me shit, can't tell me nuh-uh
But I am a rich m-mother fucker
Pull up in that trucka, we like buckuh! buckuh!
Niggas runnin' runnin', takin' cover cover
Your bitch a freak, I got her under a cover cover (Thotties!)
She give me head, she don't give a mother fucker
I think I shoulda never told her that I loved her
But the only thing I really love is money
I shoulda never ever ever ever fucked her
Cause I swear that bitch gon' always be on me

[Hook]

[Outro]
How I look now (x3)
How I look now, nigga
How I look now (x3)
How I look now, nigga
How I look now (x3)
