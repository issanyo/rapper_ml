[Intro: FTR Drama]
Ballin' like I'm Michael, cuz Sosa from Chiraq
Keep that GG and that rifle, that chopper from Iraq
BSG, we 3Hunna, we be thuggin' peep my tats, You be fuckin' with them ho niggas
Get blown off the map. FTR shit nigga, GBE shit nigga, Chiraq to Clipsburg Sosa in this bitch (Sosa Baby)

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I be shining, cus all my diamonds, I spent a dub on
I got plenty Louis and Fendi, yo bitch she love it
My lil niggas hot, they knock ya top off
Indicted for sellin' out my house and doin' drop-offs
I get so high, swear I be so high I feel like Top Dog
Im from 300 O'Block, you a real nigga, knock-off
Glock 40, clip hold fifty boy don't shot down
That Mac hold a hunnid shots, don't get shot down in yo' town
I make it rain 100's and 50's, on all these stripper hoes
No feelings but I'm addicted, to all these stripper hoes
My shooters, tote K's and rugers, look like a gun show
Talk outside of yo' mouth, boy you gone get gunned down

[Hook: FTR Drama]
Hittin' licks and movin', bricks I'm servin' all the white folks
Shawty wanna fuck with me, she heard that I might blow
Ballin' like im Michael, shining like some white gold
Got some hittas in the midst, loadin' up them rifles
Go (2x) she heard that I might blow
Go (2x) I'm ballin' like I'm Michael
Go (2x) I'm shinin' like some white gold
Go (2x) They loadin' up them rifles

[Verse 2: FTR Drama]
This 40 I keep it on me, like it's hoey
She on me, she wanna fuck me, but she don't know me
Its Drama, I'm 'bout that drama, I do the troopin'
I'm ballin', bitch I'm ballin' but I ain't hoopin'
My dog gone, my car do 1 5 we 'bout that shootin'
We winnin', ain't no prentendin', You niggas losin'
He tryin' me, somebody found 'em, with his eyes shut
You bitch niggas try and diss niggas, you will get lined up
Foreign, my gun is foreign, these Gucci's foreign
GG, through the GG, boo and its borin'
Strip club I threw 'bout ten up
I had it pourin', Harm he
Bitch at the body, my niggas scorin'
