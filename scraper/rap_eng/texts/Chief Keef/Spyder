[Intro]
808 Mafia
BasedKash on the beat

[Hook: Ballout]
Boy that ain't no real dope
Better call my cellular phone
I got gas OG skunk
Reeking out my Cali home
Ridin' on that candy paint
Lookin' like an icy cone
My wrist is so icy hom'
I can take your wifey home
Spend one night with me, now she can't sleep at night at home
I pull up in Spyders, I let my lil niggas take rifles home
Cashin' out at the dealer, I just took a new title home
Cashin' out at the dealer, I just took a new title home

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Just took the title
Pulled off in the spyder
Some much ice, who's brighter
Fuck a jewel buyer
Someone pass me a lighter
Fendi belter two sider
Bitch I'm with a one nighter
I don't wanna her, I don't like her
Just cashed out Barneys
Me and Ben Frank's army
Cash fallin' now war me
Splash a bitch named stormy
I keep a first aid on me
Walk around with all this cake
Got people's birthday on me
It must be your first day homie
Ain't no nice guys, it might be your worst day homie
I keep them big racks on me
It don't take a show to see I keep that good gas on me

[Hook: Ballout]
Boy that ain't no real dope
Better call my cellular phone
I got gas OG skunk
Reeking out my Cali at home
Ridin' on that candy paint
Lookin' like an icy cone
My wrist is so icy hom'
I can take your wifey home
Spend one night with me, now she can't sleep at night at home
I pull up in Spyders, I let my lil niggas take rifles home
Cashin' out at the dealer, I just took a new title home
Cashin' out at the dealer, I just took a new title home

[Verse 2: Sada Baby]
Duck with a rifle
Lean in my apple cider
Diamonds bite like a tiger
Chopper end a nigga lifer
I don't fuck with both siders
Foreign whip a two seater
Stuff three bitches in it
And got three pistols wit' it nigga
Scuba Steve baby I've been ballin' since the third grade
Choppa [?] turned his momma crib into a bird cage
Turned a nigga great-granny house to a haunted house
Mobs talk through a nigga window fairly runnin' out
Gotta love the street Gucci down let that Uzi sound
Prada and nightlights in yo' town scuba booby mouth
Make me send a bullet through yo' mouth hollow root canal
Keep my shooters proud cuz I don't know what I'd do wit' out 'em

[Hook: Ballout]
Boy that ain't no real dope
Better call my cellular phone
I got gas OG skunk
Reeking out my Cali home
Ridin' on that candy paint
Lookin' like an icy cone
My wrist is so icy hom'
I can take your wifey home
Spend one night with me, now she can't sleep at night at home
I pull up in Spyders, I let my lil niggas take rifles home
Cashin' out at the dealer, I just took a new title home
Cashin' out at the dealer, I just took a new title home
