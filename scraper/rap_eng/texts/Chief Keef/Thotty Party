[Intro]
Feel like I'ma old man
Feel like I'ma

[Hook]
Feel like I'ma old man
I've been doing this shit a long time
I've been on my grind a long time (bitch)
Don't know why I'm never on time (never on time)
'Cause I got a watch, this bitch shining (shining, bling blow)
Tracked all the thotties (tracked all the thotties, thotties)
Run with the (?), come on (running with them)
I'm finna have a thotty party

[Verse 1]
My wrist, it look like potty
My chain look like potty
I'm sitting here, looking at this thotty
Tryna see if I wanna pipe it
Turn my Beamer to a skittle
I think I need to cut my ceiling
Turn that bitch to a drop X6M
I see it and I'm coping it, or them
Riding in that foreign, finna make a film
Finna make a movie, finna make some bands
Spend a couple bands on that Mercedes-Benz
MG kit, riding fast, tryna break a (?)
