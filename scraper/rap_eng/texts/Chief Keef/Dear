I  just hit a lick, I'm finna take a trip
Might go to China, with a lotta grip
Grip up on my hip, Imma let it rip
And my pocket money, I'm professor built
Blood gang, I fuck with crips, nigga I'm fuckin' dipped
Glo Gang, nigga we the fuckin' shit
I'm high bitch, I'm smokin'
They play me on your fuckin' strip
I got a letter, Imma start it off with "Dear"

[Verse 1]
Come thru in all black
White chocolate whistles
I got a gun
Why the fuck would I call some niggas?
A nigga said that he went on Chief Sosa, neva
I'm a fuckin' dog, ruff ruff get em'
Benihanas, ridin' through your block chefin'
If you gon bring a knife nigga don't bring not a weapon
I'm smokin' on the skunk and this is smelly
Chief Sosa Buddha cuz I got a big old belly
She said she want my time, but I can't tell it (thotty)
Its bling blingy, a nigga felt it
Swear these niggas always jokin'
Fuckin Mike Eppin'
Bitch I'm gettin' money, how am I jealous?
I ain't got no jets so I ride first class
I swear my fuckin' seat turn into a bed
The pilot saw my eyes and said they awfully red
I told him "I get high as you, I'm the man"

[Hook]
I  just hit a lick, I'm finna take a trip
Might go to China, with a lotta grip
Grip up on my hip, Imma let it rip
And my pocket money, I'm professor built
Blood gang, I fuck with crips, nigga I'm fuckin' dipped
Glo Gang, nigga we the fuckin' shit
I'm high bitch, I'm smokin'
They play me on your fuckin' strip
I got a letter, Imma start it off with "Dear"

[Verse 2]
Dear miss, I'm that fuckin' nigga
Hot as ice, swear that I'm so cicle
Ruler in that contagious, that sicka
It's lookin' like a fuckin' sticker
I caught a stain, he get stepped up
With my zo's in Miami, flipped up
They bring them sticks out and stuck ya
You thinkin' that you hard, they push ya
I'm finna take a trip to Russia
Just gave 10 thousand to my fuckin'  mother
And 20 to my grandmother
I left and told em' that I love em'
Called Kay Kay on the phone she like "Hey daddy"
"I like what you doin" swear she so happy
She want all the clothes
She wanna be so swaggy
I named my son Your Highness
I named my MAC Macky

[Hook]
I  just hit a lick, I'm finna take a trip

And my pocket money, I'm professor built
Blood gang, I fuck with crips, nigga I'm fuckin' dipped
Glo Gang, nigga we the fuckin' shit
I'm high bitch, I'm smokin'
