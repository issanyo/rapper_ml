[Intro: Cdot Honcho]
Grrah
TrellGotWings, bitch

[Chorus: Cdot Honcho]
Ayy, sadity bitch, Amiri fit, Hellcat hitting 206
Biscotti smoke, Givenchy kicks, before the taxes, I paid about 6
I did it dolo, I ain't owing shit, fuck all them niggas we ain't rolling with
It's snakes in the grass, so we keep mowing it, prices went up and I ain't lowering it
Ayy, sadity bitch, Amiri fit, Hellcat hitting 206
Biscotti smoke, Givenchy kicks, before the taxes, I paid about 6
I did it dolo, I ain't owing shit, fuck all them niggas we ain't rolling with
It's snakes in the grass, so we keep mowing it, prices went up and I ain't lowering it

[Verse 1: Cdot Honcho]
Focused on cash, get up with me later, green in my pocket matching my laser
Standing alone, fuck whoever ain't with, who tryna race me? They ain't trying to bet us
New ice on my body, I'm cold as a penguin, eyes getting lazy, I'm high as a pigeon
Riding with equipment that rip off a ligament, ceiling high window, fuck her in the kitchen
Two door know magic, I call it Houdini, teleport all around, you barely seen me
Redbone waist 'bout slim as my TV, I'm fucking, not cuffing, bailing when fussing
Backwood look like a turkey with stuffing, pockets bloated, FN loaded
Draco included 200 in total, YSL polo 500 in total
Fucking on sisters, I thought they was cuzzos, one of them yours, you would think she was Honcho's
Riding with a pistol that spit like an auto, sadity bitch, body shaped like a bottle
Dick make her turn to psychopath, new money, just got it, it never last
Dripping, I'm fresh as a bubble bath, I live it up 'cause this shit I ain't never have

[Chorus: Cdot Honcho]
Ayy, sadity bitch, Amiri fit, Hellcat hitting 206
Biscotti smoke, Givenchy kicks, before the taxes, I paid about 6
I did it dolo, I ain't owing shit, fuck all them niggas we ain't rolling with
It's snakes in the grass, so we keep mowing it, prices went up and I ain't lowering it
Ayy, sadity bitch, Amiri fit, Hellcat hitting 206
Biscotti smoke, Givenchy kicks, before the taxes, I paid about 6
I did it dolo, I ain't owing shit, fuck all them niggas we ain't rolling with
It's snakes in the grass, so we keep mowing it, prices went up and I ain't lowering it

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I hit New Orleans for soul food
Oh, you got mula? I do too, oh it's fuck me? Fuck you
Put pieces on ya, puzzle, light your shit up, bulbs too
Abracadabra, bug you (Huh, yeah, yeah)
Gon' drop a pin, we coming through, married the stendex, I do
So where you been at? Counting my loot (Huh, yeah, yeah)
That pistol go pap, Remy, du-du-du-du-du, he dizzy
Baby say it's hard to get me (Huh, yeah, yeah)
She give me McGuire, no Lizzy, hold up, bitch, slow down, I'm busy
I shake it up 'til it's fizzy, baby tap me, ask "What is we?"
She see me takeoff in that 6 speed, the cookie get crumbled, no Sarah Lee
Yeah, I got 30, shoot 17, shoot the cannon like its a 7D
Can't have no nigga that's better than me, counting this money like heaven to me
I really donâ€™t care, let be what it be, I got places to be and people to see
Niggas stop hating, I hate when they do, they be acting like it's okay what they do
Stick got a drum and he came with that too (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
One lil slip and you making the news, you really so sweet as a ache in my tooth
Who hitting the melodies? AK Badu (Yeah)

[Chorus: Cdot Honcho]
Ayy, sadity bitch, Amiri fit, Hellcat hitting 206
Biscotti smoke, Givenchy kicks, before the taxes, I paid about 6
I did it dolo, I ain't owing shit, fuck all them niggas we ain't rolling with
It's snakes in the grass, so we keep mowing it, prices went up and I ain't lowering it
Ayy, sadity bitch, Amiri fit, Hellcat hitting 206
Biscotti smoke, Givenchy kicks, before the taxes, I paid about 6
I did it dolo, I ain't owing shit, fuck all them niggas we ain't rolling with
It's snakes in the grass, so we keep mowing it, prices went up and I ain't lowering it
