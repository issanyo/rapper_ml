[Verse 1: Big Lean]
Bitch get down with the get down
Y'all gonna wait till I'm rich now
All you see me with Sosa
So you know I'm getting closer
Keep that strap with no holster
Just to pop at a joker
You should know from way back
That lean don't play that
I'm trying to live how a king should live
Thinking back, when my mama lost a crib
Thinking back, on when they told me
My brother would live
Now it's us against the world, something gotta give
I'm on a roll and nobody can stop me
The fliest thing looking out of Gianni Versace
The diamond rings you could swear I'm related to Papi
T.O, lean back, get that dough
I stay on my humble, I came up in this jungle
Raised in the 'jects of Toronto
They clap for tweets we don't follow
Might just send you a holla
And tell you to hold that
I'm just letting you know that
Fly down here might not go back

[Hook]
Money, Cars, Clothes, that's my lifestyle
Ice keep me flows, that's my lifestyle
You can call it pimpin', but that's my lifestyle
More henny overflowed, that's my lifestyle
That's my lifestyle x4
Keep them pussies on they toes, that's my lifestyle (Bang, Bang)
That's my lifestyle x2

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I pull up, get out, bitches pull their tits out
I'm Chief Sosa, the shit now
I meant to say I'm rich now
I'm bout' what I pay now
I don't work for shit now
Either get hit or get down
Merk you, you can't snitch now
Chief Sosa from O-Block
300 on both blocks
On both blocks we tote Glocks
On both blocks we blow Glocks
On both blocks we kill Ops
Sad stories Soap Ops
You ain't no gangsta, 2Pac
Shoot you up like O-Dog
Now I think I might cue
One phone call a roll call
I'm coolin' on frontstreet
In the field with my bro gods
And I think I might cue
One phone call a roll call
I'm coolin' on frontstreet
In the field with my bro gods

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Lean]
Degrees, we up in here
Swaggin' in my fur
Young baller like Corey on the bench
The money over there, right on the dresser
Told you I'll see you again baby there's no pressure
These rappers try hard just stay current, they can't keep up
No endurance
Ass fine, she suckin' while I'm starin'
A girl in the back, she can't stop starin'

[Hook]
