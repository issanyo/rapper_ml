[Hook]
I'm a lil nigga nigga but I came to shoot
Thirty in that [?]
All these rappers they be so damn fu', pull up and do you
You's a dumb nigga, pull up to yo' block and I'ma drum nigga
Drop the gun, I just saw cops and I'ma run nigga
I got thirty in my heater, do you want to meet her
My Glock .40 a grim reaper, aye, let these hundred rounds blow

[Post-Hook]
Pull up on yo' block, that's a Faneto

[Verse 1]
Baby girl it's now or never, baby girl I gotta chase this cheddar
Hell naw, I cannot get fed up, pull up on yo' block it's a set-up
Ridin' down the opp block, gotta let this tool pop
Snatch y chain and I ain't goin', you know I'ma get to blowin'
For my chains they be so frozen, by my wrist you know I'm glowin'
Niggas mad at me, because my pockets stuffed wit' that cake
And they really gon' be mad my .30 stuffed in they face
Niggas ask if I'm fine, I done lost my mind
Got this Tec-9, now it's yo' bed time

[Hook]
I'm a lil nigga nigga but I come to shoot
Thirty aimed at you
All these rappers they be so damn fu', pull up and do you
You's a dumb nigga, pull up to yo' block and I'ma drum nigga
Drop the gun, I just saw cops and I'ma run nigga
I got thirty in my heater, do you want to meet her
My Glock .40 a grim reaper, aye, let these hundred rounds go

[Post-Hook]
Pull up on yo' block, that's a Faneto

[Verse 2]
Look at me the wrong way, let this .30 go to waste
Them bullets place up in yo' face, off the dope boy I'm spaced
Off this Tooka pack, double trigger Ruger
Pull up like a scooter, I need me some shooter
My Glock longer than a ruler, smokin' on you losers
Got the Mac, it go rat-a-tat, shoot it to your back
I got the chrome, dressed in all black, and I'm off the Ac'
Got the sack, I just spent it all, I'ma get it back
Got some guns and a couple choppers, don't make me attack, no
No-o, nah, nah, nah

[Hook]
I'm a lil nigga nigga but I came to shoot
Thirty in that [?]
All these rappers they be so damn fu', pull up and do you
You's a dumb nigga, pull up to yo' block and I'ma drum nigga
Drop the gun, I just saw cops and I'ma run nigga
I got thirty in my heater, do you want to meet her
My Glock .40 a grim reaper, aye, let these hundred rounds blow
