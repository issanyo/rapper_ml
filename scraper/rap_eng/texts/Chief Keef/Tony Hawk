[Intro: Chief Keef]
Damn baby, look at these diamonds
Walk up in this motherfucker shining
I'm Almighty
Tony Hawk

[Hook: Chief Keef]
Walk up in this motherfucker shining
Damn baby, look at these diamonds
Anything I see I wanna buy it
Tony Hawk bitch, always grinding
Niggas on that hating shit, I don't mind it
Niggas know we about that violence
Seen the cops, I was hiding
Thots see me, I was sliding

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Money be my right hand, I got my Breitling on my left
That money be my wifey, you know I ain't got no spouse
Look at that hoe up over there
Look at that thot, watch I get her
She seen my ice then I hit her
What I do? Pass her to my niggas
I'm cooling in Benihanas but I don't eat lobster
Bitch I'm eating 10 steaks, call me sosa big ball
Sosa 2Pac
Riding around the west side in Bevely Hills in a new 'Rarri
She know niggas will never be too sorry like Tadoe
Aye, with my bankroll
Don't get mixed in that mango
Come through chopping shit with my Johnny Dang on

[Hook: Chief Keef]
Walk up in this motherfucker shining
Damn baby, look at these diamonds
Anything I see I want, I'm buying it
Tony Hawk bitch, always grinding
Niggas on that hating shit, I don't mind it
Niggas know we about that violence
Seen the cops, I was hiding
Thots see me, I was sliding
