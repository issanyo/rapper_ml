[Verse]
Kush to face, that's the antidote
Cops pull us over, don't panic hoe, aye
Hey, hittin' home runs just like Sammy Sosa
I'm smokin' dope, you smokin cantaloupe
You smokin' watermelon, you smoke fruit pack
Where they do that at
Bitch I smoke the best O-G
My breitling better than your Rollie
Who you?,aye I don't know you!
Glock on me, turn your ass to tofu
Turn your ass to Thai food
Do a drive-by by you
Hit you aye, guarantee won't miss you
Boy I know your momma's gonna miss you
And kiss you, give her a tissue
Time to pull up on the opps get our pistols
Niggas too old, I swear these niggas too grown
I'm too young, with all this money
What the fuck I'mma do with all this money?, aye
I'mma spend it then get it back, aye
I'mma spend it, just make niggas mad, aye
I'mma spend it, I ain't gon ride in Jags, aye
I'mma spend it on a fuckin' M-5, M-6
Aye, aye and a Rari
Aye, aye, pull up, pull off sorry
Ain't no talkin'
Aye, you knew that the coppers lurkin'
They lookin' for Almighty
Cuz they see me in that tall body
Ridin' round look like Yao Ming
It's a bird, it's a plane, it's almighty
Money in my right and left and back pocket, aye
Aye all these bitches polly pocket
Aye, all they want is all me pockets
Aye, I just told them thottie stop it
Aye, I just told them thottie pop it
Aye, You gotta little butt
Can you turn it up?
You got some lips, what can you do with them?
Can you handle this pipe?, aye
Girl it probably change your life
I'm rollin' off a flat too
Bitch you know what a flat do
We gonna fuck all night
We gonna bust all night
Glowin' hard bitch, I bust all the lights
Too cold, I bust all the pipes, aye
Like Dro say, when you're right, you're right, aye
