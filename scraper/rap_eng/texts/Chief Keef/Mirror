I'm bout my check, Nike Air
I am so unfair
I think you need a chair
Waiting on me to fail
You say you seen some money
Nigga tell me where
Is it over there?
Or is it in here?
I'm going overseas Im so used to Navy Pier
My car from overseas, at the light bitches stare
But I dont really care
Hop out look at my gear
I see Almighty Sosa when I look in the Mirror

[Verse 1]
I get money bitch Im serious
Riding fast my car so fierce
My car bet my cops so furious
My car bad like a lil kid
I beat my bitches like my kids
I treat these niggas like my kids
Your inquires serious and I'm so serious
Know I'm riding and Im so feared
And I'm so weird
Member posted on the block selling beats
Every motherfucking club that I see
I be pulling up in the Rarri, felon-ney-neyy
Walking up in the clubs, they're with me-me
Walking up in them stores buying everything I see
In the Jewlery store get my diamonds tested
Then I take a look up at ya everything sheisty
The Balenciagas super big, man everything Nike

[Verse 2]
Take a look up in the Mirror, I see me
I don't wanna be nobody, I be me
Who your bitch going to see nigga? Prolly me
And she Spanish so you know she papi me
Can't come to the mansion, told her lobby me
Then we walk up in there told her Harley me
And then when we finish you know I be clean
Out the door, in my car, riding mean
She was on top of me and topping me
I was counting money in the money machine
Don't give a fuck if you a train, ain't no stopping me
And I ain't gon be on time, so ain't no clocking me
Sosa is your rollin, bitch I might be
Nah baby I just do it just like Nike
And baby that money flowing let me wify
All you can do is suck and scrap me
