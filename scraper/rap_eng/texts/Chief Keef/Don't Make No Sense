[Intro : Master P & Chief Keef]
Sosa, (?), Master P
This shit don't make no sense
It's like a movie, I'm the director
My lil nigga (?) he (?)
They say what don't kill you make you stronger
Niggas scared to fuck with us though!

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Ganja Ganja, I be smoking Ganja
I gets lots of commas, and I can fuck yo momma
Tote .30s no revolvers
Flexing in the summer
Riding in my Hummer, 24s vellano's
Thumbing through the check
Steady buying them tecs and shit
I got no limit in the clip in my fn and I let it spit
Ay Trel over here, he pull up in the whip
Gotta lot of banana clips, fruity nigga don't get mixed
I say bitch I'm from Chiraq, we got more killers than Afghanistan
O-block its just us, we the new Klux Klan
All my boys knock hammers
Now all of your niggas damaged
Some of your boys won't make it
From these 300 cannons bang

[Hook: Chief Keef]
This shit don't make no sense (nah)
This shit don't make no sense
This shit don't make no sense (nah)
This shit don't make no sense (huh)
I say this shit don't make no sense
This payroll in my pocket
This shit don't make no sense (huh)
I say this shit don't make no sense
This 100 in my clip
This shit don't make no sense (huh)
I say this shit don't make no sense bang

[Verse 2: Master P]
In the jungle with killas
Tell the streets that we made it
Untouchable niggas, we was born to be hated
Me and Sosa won't tell it, we get money together
Hood niggas we eating and we die for whatever
See they sacred of my niggas, they wouldn't give him a ride
I said free C-Murder and we gonna ride for Trayvon
Taking pictures in the hood, some of these niggas be snitches
Pillow talking with hoes, while I'm counting my riches
Bad bitches we call it, I'm on the block with my niggas
Louie V on the pillows smoking weed with them killas
I'm a ride for my niggas now the world gone feel us
Underrated by some, disputed by many

[Hook: Chief Keef]
This shit don't make no sense (nah)
This shit don't make no sense
This shit don't make no sense (nah)
This shit don't make no sense (huh)

I say this shit don't make no sense bang

[Verse 3: Fat Trel]
This shit don't make no sense
All the money all the bitches I get
Ride high but my 40 ride low
It's on my lap I don't tote it in the air
I can't forget to flip and whip and make a pot
Molly high you can see it in my eyes
Give her dick cause I know she likes to ride
And she fuck me anywhere at any time
I make a hit she take a brick and break it down
Stuff the brick and make my bitches wait in line
It's nothing new cause boy I do this all the time
And since I shoot she better knew to have mine

[Hook: Chief Keef]
This shit don't make no sense (nah)
This shit don't make no sense

I say this shit don't make no sense bang
