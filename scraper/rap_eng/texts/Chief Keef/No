Is it something I gotta know?
Baby is it something I gotta know?
Is it something I gotta know?
Is it something I gotta know?
Baby is it something I gotta know?
Baby is it something I need to know?
Let me know now
So you can go now
Move the fuck around
Don't come back, around
Nooooo
Is it something I need to know?
Is it something I need to know?
You know, I need to know
I don't mean to treat you though
But baby is it something I need to know?

[Verse 1]
She gave me top it's that wet pack
Whilst smoking on cat pack
I don't know about that pack
Nigga this is that jetpack
You be smoking on wet pack
That out the ass crack...pack
I be smoking on jet lag
Don't think my jet landed yet
Steady texting my phone
Baby tell me what's wrong?
Out the front of my home
Baby ain't there I'm gone
Love me cause I got guap
Would you like if my hair was gone?
Would you like me if my hair was shorter
Or if my hair was long?

[Bridge]
Know, ay, know
I want you to know this
Know
You can tell me any day
(Nooooo)
You know, you know where I am
I only got, I got thots
I just wanna know
Keep keep it real with them you know
I know you wanna chill later
Just keep it real with a nigga though you know?

[Verse 2]
Would you love me if my hair was gone?
If my hair was short or if my hair was long?
Would you love me if I didn't have the throne?
Would you love me if I didn't have a song?
If I didn't have mills would you still chill?
Would you still be cool as fuck like a windmill
And if I got locked up would you write to me everyday?
And if I was in the army would you Skype me every day?
