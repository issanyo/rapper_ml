[Hook]
You can smell when I'm coming
White bitch, man she peel like it's nothing
I got the weed rolling up and a lighter in my hand
Got some money in my pocket, let's get right onto the van
$4000 for the coat, boss shit
Paid a thousand for my loafs
Bitch I'm fly, propellers
Fuck the Pradas, I'ma take the Margielas

[Verse 1]
These niggas hating, that's what she telling me
Tell them boys, man I'll be what they never be
In a mansion smoking hella weed
Riding foreign, doors up, bitches loving me
I get top like a satellite
I'm going crazy man I think I need 7 mics
Told her catch the holy ghost
Bitch you can call me Reverend Mike
Bitch you sleep like you ain't slept in 11 nights
I got a crazy ass timepiece
Breitling gets in her pants, he's a mindfreak
I'm sitting outside of the club and she told me she like my timepiece
I told her if he help out he can make the line tweak

[Hook]
You can smell when I'm coming
White bitch, man she pale like it's nothing
I got the weed rolling up and a lighter in my hand
Got some money in my pocket, let's get right onto the van
$4000 for the coke, boss shit
Paid a thousand for my loafs
Bitch I'm fly, propellers
Fuck the Pradas, I'ma take the Margielas
I just left the Cap center

[Verse 2]
I bought 10 pairs of Margielas
Bitch my job is to make these niggas jealous
They be digging my pimpin'
I see stars, oh man am I tripping
I got marble floors, don't slip baby
I always got my feet up, don't trip baby
You get it, I have my feet up so much you would trip baby
But tell me something, do I got money on my lip baby?
I call my Margielas Mar-jealous
Cause every time I put 'em on niggas jealous
Cause I be cashing out I'm hot, check my temperature
I be capping, riding round like a cylinder

[Hook]
You can smell when I'm coming
White bitch, man she pale like it's nothing
I got the weed rolling up and a lighter in my hand
Got some money in my pocket, let's get right onto the van
$4000 for the coke, boss shit
Paid a thousand for my loafs
Bitch I'm fly, propellers
Fuck the Pradas, I'ma take the Margielas
