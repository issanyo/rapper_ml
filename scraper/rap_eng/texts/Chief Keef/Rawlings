[Intro: Ballout]
DP on the beat
Smokes! Glo!
Blood gang, man
Motherfuckas know how we rockin', man
Glo Gang or no gang, man
Stupid blunts man, four wheel drive man, stupid kush
So motherfuckin' high right now man
Motherfuckin' mansion man, got all these acres
I don't know where the fuck I'm at man, feel me?
All type of whips outside
M6's, Audi's, and shit

[Verse: Chief Keef]
Aye, Bally
Aye, aye, pass me the rawlings, aye, aye
So I can ball
Bitches already know that we ballin'
I'm at The Mardi Gras in New Orleans
Choppas out, get 'em, boys
Got them dogs out, sniff 'em
Runnin' round your kitchen, where yo shit at?
Send my locksmith at yo door
Send my block, at your folks
Send that glo, we posted on the glo block with big ass poles
Where the glo block at? North suburbs
In my mansion, bitch, ya never heard
Where it's at? You never know
Try to follow me, then I'ma blow
I can be drivin', still got the pipe
Be drivin', and I'll still take your life
Pull up on ya bitch, I'm still taking flight
I'm off the tooka and I'm still getting high
And higher, aye
Waiting for the days to go by, and by-er, aye
Only thing that matter is the money, aye
Wake up in the morning yawning aye, gettin' money
Fuckin' honey's, fuckin' thots
Fuck nigga, fuck up your party or your posse
Turn it to a pool party
Almighty, you mighty
In my 290
Catch you, you a body
Under him, aye, what was wrong with him?
I don't know, 'cause I'm bipolar
When he shoot, he shoot at your shoulder
Have yo pipe up, catch you, rawlings
Nigga we don't carry holsters
Riding with a interlapse, ain't got time for that chitter chat
Fuck nigga got me I'ma get em' back
This choppa break a niggas back
(Duh-da-da) nigga
