A lot of niggas you know talk and walk
To what I’m saying stealing beats and shit
Niggas just mad cause I upped the jock on them with Khaled
And then you know
Carl Hagyard type of shit is running out
And like damn how they do that how they
Do that for how who do that man who call
I can’t believe he is talking about you playing
With guns and shit you know but they know
They know how it really go they know I been
Glo gang they know I been a wild out boy
Since day one 10 years nigga and all shit
That I rock with im 'rond the team you need to separate yourself
Around me they know I’m with this shit for
Real they just know toilet instagram shit
I’m fighting two cases around here in two
Different states both fatal both bound over
A hundred thousand and I’m bonding out
And 20 hours later they know what's up
