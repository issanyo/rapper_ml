[Hook]
Girl I know you wonder wonder
When I'm when I'm coming home
I am getting money money
Chilling on my own
I be countin' hunnids hunnids
Girl please leave me 'lone
Smokin' tooka blunted, at the top where I belong
Hop up in my car I'm ridin' ridin'
Lookin' for some money money
Told a bitch stop I'm coming coming
Gotta go and get this money money
Been woke up niggas runnin' runnin'
These niggas ain't on nothin' nothin'
Sorry baby, I gotta go get this fucking money

[Verse 1]
Aye she like how I walk, how I talk
She like that I get gwop, spend some gwop
Fifty cent bitch, hop up in my car
I walk in the club, don't drink go buy the bar
She gave me brain, she so smart
I need to get that top for 24 hours

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
All I see is money money
Ray-Bans on my face it's money money
Rasta like it's selling money
Jump in count this money coming
Fuck hoes all in London London
Katie went out there to get me some money
Money money money money
All I care about is money money
Money money money money
Money money money money

[Hook]

[Outro]
Money money money money money
Aye Aye

Gotta go and get this money money money honey
Gotta go and get this money twenties fifties hunneds
Money money
