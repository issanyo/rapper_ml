[Verse]
Niggas be like when I see Sosa, I'ma treat that nigga on everythang
But niggas don't be on a damn thang
Niggas ain't even snatch my damn chain
Smoke so many trees, wonder what my breath like
But I be shinin' bright like a damn light
You should be like Asian girls, baby girl you damn right
Cause these thotties going any damn way
Unlike me, who can do it any better
I'ma do this shit in any weather
And I bet I'll have your bitch follow my campaign
Try me, guns be like I am bang
Cause we got two twelves, when them guns blow and bang
Let me catch a nigga from the low and bang
Let me catch a nigga from Insane
He gone be on the first song right along with Ben Franklin

[Hook]
