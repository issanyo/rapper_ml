Can't Wait
Fuck Nigga, Can't Wait x3

(hook)
Can't Wait
Fuck Nigga, Can't Wait
I can't wait to catch his ass and shoot him in his face
I can't wait to let these shells put him in a case
I can't wait to get that check today
Spent the other one yesterday, nigga
I can't wait
I get too much damn guap
Get another one tomorrow
I can't wait

(verse)
Walk up on St. Lawrence
With this gat bitch I'm blowing
Fuck nigga keep talking
Then imma get to shouting
Bitch i still got this ice
Tadoe got that mother fucking pipe
Smoking fucking tooka
Catch that fuck nigga on sight
Im a shark in the ocean
Pop a flat then im rolling and toting
Catch a opp i blow his fucking face
Mexicans, blacks, and race, every race
Pull of then we racing
See the cops now they chasing us
We don't give a fuck
Been doing this shit from since 061
Ask me what the fuck i got next
Flexing nigga in this fucking shit
My chopper look like big glo
Don't make me run up in your shit
