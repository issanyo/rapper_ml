[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Cause she know I got that good wood
I wham and I bam and I juug juug
She leave out my house on a good foot

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I hit her ass up with that Worldstar
I Lollapalooza her good spot
She swallow the kids I say "good girl"
Even though she'll make a good mom
She said she never met a met a good nigga
I said never met a good cop
She suck on that dick like a push pop
She get mad as hell when I pull out
She knows that there's only one Tunechi
She be like Weezy I love Tunechi
I be like baby don't confuse me
Then I play with that pussy like a Rubix
Between me and you she call me sexy chocolate
And I swear that pussy like fudge to me
She say come over and come get it
She said cum on me, cum in me, cum through me
Cause she ain't never been dicked down
She don't know how that feel
She ain't ever been licked down
From her earrings to her heels, Lord
She ain't ever been in a big house
I gotta watch her so she don't steal
She ain't ever been with a millionaire

[Verse: Cheif Keef]
She on me like why you don't go to sleep?
I'm like baby girl I don't know what's sleep
All I go is crazy, you can go with me
You can hop in my car and hit the road with me
You was smoking blunts, can't smoke with me
You was rolling blunts, can't roll for me
Girl you can't even hit the club with me
You can't walk in the house with the dub with me
Shorty said she want to rule the world with me
She said Chief Sosa the new Hercules
She said she wanna pull up on me urgently
But I told her [?]
I ain't got no time, no time, got no time
I can't even tell the time
I'm I motherfuckin' [?]
She was flexin' the whole time, the whole time
Actin' like she wasn't goin'
But I know she lyin'
I brought the woods, brought that good weed
I need money to do good deeds
I need money I got good needs
She take off her shoe she get good feet
She give me head, yeah she got good knees
She started runnin' she got good cleats
Then she started talking about she love me

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
I hit her ass up with that Worldstar
I Lollapalooza her good spot
She swallow the kids I say "good girl"
Even though she'll make a good mom
She said she never met a met a good nigga
I said never met a good cop
She suck on that dick like a push pop
She get mad as hell when I pull out
She knows that there's only one Tunechi
She be like Weezy I love Tunechi
I be like baby don't confuse me
Then I play with that pussy like a Rubix
Between me and you she call me sexy chocolate
And I swear that pussy like fudge to me
She say come over and come get it
She said cum on me, cum in me, cum through me
Cause she ain't never been dicked down
She don't know how that feel
She ain't ever been licked down
From her earrings to her heels, Lord
She ain't ever been in a big house
I gotta watch her so she don't steal
She ain't ever been with a millionaire
