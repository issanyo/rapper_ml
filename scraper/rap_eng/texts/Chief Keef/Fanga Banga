[Verse 1: Rocko]
Real niggas are in danger
Cause that money never changed us
Stacking by the milly, fuck all the remainder
Keep the lawyer on retainer if you a gangster
I ain’t gon’ eat her, but I’m gon’ bang her
A few actresses, a few singers
A few models, I got all of the new models
Business is business, I live by that motto
Smash out I ain’t gon’ linger
Straight to the point, I float the boat to the hanger
I do this for the sport
Kick shit, hummer hummer, cross country runner
Quarterback, I never fumble
Natural born runner

[Hook: Rocko]
Finger on the banger, finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, I keep my finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, I keep my finger on the banger

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Walked in the bank, came out running
Skrt skrt in my car, you would’ve thought I stole some money
Head held high, mailman disguise
I’m riding ‘round the Flats, popped like a popped tire
Be cautious or you’ll be in trouble man
Me and Rocko, winter bowl, or we see Miami Dolphins
She wanna hang with the gang
Rub off on her like some lotion
I grab my AR, click clack, it’s in motion
So much bud, Budweiser
Man, I’m the energizer
Bunny, call me Bugs Bunny, eh what’s up doc?
If you selling dope, keep it on the low
Put your hands to the ceiling, throw the money on the floor

[Hook: Rocko]
Finger on the banger, finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, I keep my finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, I keep my finger on the banger

[Hook: Rocko]
Finger on the banger, finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, I keep my finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, I keep my finger on the banger

[Bridge: Rocko]
Finger on that bang, bang, bang
Finger on that bang, bang, bang
On that bang, bang, bang
I keep my finger on that bang, bang, bang
I keep my finger on that bang, bang, bang
Keep my finger on that bang, bang, bang
Keep my finger on that bang, bang, bang
Keep my finger on that bang, bang, bang
Keep my finger on that banger, banger
Nigga all I make is bangers, bangers
Get your bitch before I bang her, bang her
Yeah, yeah

[Hook: Rocko]
Finger on the banger, finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, I keep my finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, finger on the banger
Finger on the banger, I keep my finger on the banger
