[Intro]
Ridin' wit my chopper
I'ma beat him like his father
Now there's blood on my Giuseppe's
I don't like no fuckin' Prada
Fuck he say, the fuck he say?
Fuck that nigga say?

[Verse: 1]
Ridin' with my chopper
I'mma beat him like his father
Now there's blood on my Giuseppe's
I don't like no fuckin' Pradas
Put a knife up on my tec
Little FaceTime little Skype up for my tech
And it all happened right up on my set
SOS look like her for my tec
She give me top right before I jet
I need a yacht right before my jet
I smoke some dope right before I get
Mad, blast his ass then forget
Glo Gang them my jits aye
Octane right here
I'm not saying what I did
Look at my watch Johnny God damn
We are smokin' out
Catch him in an open field that's an open fall
Bitch I will never fail or turn my fail to fall
I promise I'm not seeing y'all or hearing y'all
I get my karats flossed
Flexing like Dave the barbarian
This what I'm wearing y'all
My chain win chains by experience y'all
Smoking swishers
Counting money getting blisters
Handle your man we will fix you
All red right now I'm no Clifford
Cause I'm a dog, when it comes to fucking bitches
Cooling with my fans and taking pictures
And I got my pistol for them niggas
I'ma a pistol fuck them niggas
What you see? Pistols popping nigga
Your cars on E fill em up little nigga
Your squad on D get em up little nigga
I got my feelings tucked little nigga
Right where my pistol tucked little nigga
