What I demand in this bitch
Some bands in this bitch
Some bands in this bitch
What I demand in this bitch
That loud got me lit
So bitch get up off my dick
Cause I demand in this bitch
Some bands in this bitch
(2x)

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Bitch nigga we drill, forreal
So don't fuck around and get killed
On probation but I'm still
Chasin' that bag till I get killed
Money be the medicine cause bitch we need it
And those snitch niggas don't see it
Like Michael Jackson they ass can beat it
Hit a bitch once then she know I'm leaving
And they say I'm hot, but bitch I'm steamin'
On my dick for no apparent reason
Taking off ain't what it's seemin'
God be tellin' me that I'm a demon
I be smoke be the color of lemon
That loud pack what I'm meaning
"I need money" what I'm screaming
And like kickstands bitch I'm leaning
Bitch I go hard, can't fuck with me
Yo baby momma know Chief Keef
And every time I come around
Yo baby momma, she see me
I like gettin' tree tree
Wit a bad bitch named Keke
Tried to fight, you'll hear ping ping
This a drill bitch, get hit ding ding

[Verse 2: Lil Reese]
I just hit anotha lick
Stained his ass cause he a vic
Hollow tips all in my gun
30 poppa for the clips
Catch me snoozin', this ain't that
I got bands all on my wrist
He just acting, he a bitch
I know he ain't wit tha shits
I know he ain't wit tha shits
Shoutout to yo main bitch
Free da guys all in this bitch
64th man we do hits
Pop a pill, I'm off tha shits
Now I'm feelin' like tha shit
Famo steady talking slick
I pay no mind yo man cause he a snitch
Now let's take it to yo bitch
She eater she do dicks
She gon' bust and then we dip
Cause I'm the man in this bitch
What I demand in this bitch
Boy that remy kept me lit
Tell you bitch get off the dick
Cause I'm the man in this bitch
