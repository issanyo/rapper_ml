Hoes and Oz
Bitch how don't you know
It's in the air this L-O-U-D
I don't like sober
I'm off the lean I'm falling over
I fucked his bitch, she like to smoke
You dumb bitch, you gotta go
He spilled his act 'pon my shoes
These ain't no Jordans, bitch these Balenciaga

[Chorus]
Oh no, Oh no, Oh no, Oh no
No more hoes and oz (hoes and oz)

[Verse 2]
Smoking out this pound nigga I don't smoke skinnies
Ride pass me, niggas mad cause my truck cost a Lamboghini
I got all this money on me, I know all these bitches see me
Getting top by a wanna be Lady Gaga but she got an ass like Nicki

She like do I gotta bring my weed with me
I'm like hell nah bitch you know I be chiefing keef
She like haha you mean to me

Tryna bring her own weed but it smell like
