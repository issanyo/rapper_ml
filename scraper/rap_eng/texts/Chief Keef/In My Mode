[Intro:]
You know how Im rockin' man, cut off stockins man
Keep kush in My Mother Fuckin' Pockets
Matter Fact I Ain't Even, I Shouldn't Even Say That Shit No More
Aye Look Man, Like I Say Man
You Know? Youngest Flexer Of Mother Fuckin' All Time Nigga
Ain't Shit Changed But The Mother Fucking Address Nigga
Yeaaah, Lets Get Ittt

[Hook:]
(Sosa Babyy)
Boy you can keep that, you ain't smoking on no dope
You ain't tryna spend shit, you ain't holding on no Rolls
In Hawaii with the gang, and I'm hollering out on folks
Walked up in LV, you know I gotta pullout them O's
Comma zero zero, Comma zero zero or more
Beat the case, no P.O or no piss test, no
In a foreign driving real fast, they think that I'm on coke
You can set the difficulties, either way I am in my mode

[Verse 1]
No bitch get set wet, choppers stutter like rat-tat
Actin' like you knee deep you go fuck around and get your fuckin' neck wet
Stil spending cheese no major come back for set back
Smack a nigga with a box of dots, tell a fuck nigga to connect that
I dont get my hand dirty, but bitch i'm in it like a wet back
What about 4 pt's studio cash on the flow check that
All this cash that i'm trowing in the club look nigga try to match that
I ain't no hacking ass nigga girl i ain't trying crack that
