I just wanna know man, El Chapo 24/7 man 24. Hell I'll meet you at the backdoor get em 2 for 4 man, what's really poppin' man. I wanna know, you know? Bang, bang, bang

[Hook]
Let me go, get on the floor
What a dough
Lemme get the dope
Like you was all on me, let me go
Want problems? Then let me know
Obie's car is sexy though
I’m too turnt bitch, the levy broke
You want smoke then let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Like you holding me, let me go
You want smoke then let me know, let me know

[Verse 1]
Tell me why, every time I turn around this ho look
See I only want the top, she want me to dive in the puss
Bitch I'm fresh, I ain't actin'', this how I'm actually lookin'
Bullets going eight miles, bunny rabbit boy, don't tell me he cookin'
Tryna hang with me? Tell me he wouldn't
How they let the gang in and ebony couldn't get in
When I say ebony I'm talkin' about a bitch nigga
My niggas take your bike, you ain't gettin' shit nigga
Feel like I got a fuckin' freezer sittin' on my wrist nigga
You ain't got a ho for us, yeah the force is with us
How I'm runnin' to this money, yeah, I'm Forrest Gumpin' niggas
How I'm ridin' in my car, you would think I'm runnin' from niggas

[Hook]
Let me go, get on the floor
What a dope
Lemme get the dope
Like you was hollering, let me go
Want problems? Then let me know
Obie's car is sexy though
I’m too turnt bitch, the levy broke
You want smoke then let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Like you holding me, let me go
You want smoke then let me know, let me know

[Verse 2]
I'm boomin' like an amp
Glowin' like a lamp
You would think I was Lil Wayne
How I'm rollin' up the ramp
And just sing it like it's hymn
That's was my music teacher
I should go and search for him
I wanna fuck two of my teachers
Dunk on em Shawn Kemp, my shit off the meter
You thought I wasn't gonna blow the pistol
Til I pull up and kill you
When I say kill that's another
Chief Sosa's a dun dada
You'd think I was Jamaican
Rastafari with a chopper
I up this bitch and cock it
It say 'blaow' like Waka Flocka
They still playin' that "Love Sosa"
They like damn that was a knocker
Come through my car twisted
My whip game's proper
You gettin' us and twisted
Cause my whip game's proper

[Hook]
Let me go, get on the floor
What a dope
Lemme get the dope
Like you was hollering, let me go
Want problems? Then let me know
Obie's car is sexy though
I’m too turnt bitch, the levy broke
You want smoke then let me know
Let me know, let me know, let me know
Like you holding me, let me go
You want smoke then let me know, let me know
