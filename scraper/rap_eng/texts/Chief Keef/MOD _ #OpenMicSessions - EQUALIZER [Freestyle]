LETS GET IT

[Verse 1]
I remember the days sitting on the street
Looking at the sky chilling with Sherene
Now 13 I'm a teen
Don't talk to to them from back a day its peak
Lie, Earl, Rio, Tyreece
Not forgetting Ty, Ty, and Tyreke
Not blood but It felt like family

[Verse 2]
I heard lie left the country
I got pissed I didn't get worried
I'm chasing the music for you, got me hungry
On 'Lyrical Media' the first track I heard
Marshy, Cobra spitting their verse
Not to forget... JayDotCee
Not many friends stick out a hand for me
Don't worry I don't mean It literally
I've worked hard to get on 'MOD'
Now I'm making a path for my family

[Verse 3]
BBM status "Back round ends" or "Route to Tesco"
Not now but that was years ago
Big up everyone that has helped me grow
I'm still learning though
It annoys me that my Dad wakes up at '3'
To give a good life for my brother and me
Grateful the cupboards are filled cah many peoples are empty
I want my fam to have a house a next to the sea
So I'm not just doing music for me
One day Mom you'll see me on TV

[Verse 4]
2014 come back from a school trip Kelly was dead
I couldn't stop barling on my Nan's stairs
It got me wondering "Who's going next?"
Like Mist said "The only thing you're promised in life is death!"
2011 Nicky had her last breathe
Hit me in my heart... Not my head
It took a while, to sink in
To anyone listening
You're alive its a blessing

[Verse 5]
In life there's lessons to learn
Nicky got buried and Kelly got burned
I know one day It'll be me in that herse
For now I'm writing my own verse
To go far I need to grind
Don't worry about sleep be up all night
I can get sleep when I've got that life
But for now I'll be in bed watching 'Family Guy'
Puts me in that happy vibe
And numbs the anger in my mind
Ready for take off just waiting on time
Guess I'm still waiting in line

[Verse 6]
I ain't gonna lie I've got a long way to go
To improve on my rap to improve on my flow
I'm only one person on this spinning globe
Write whatever you want in the comments
Click the dislike button I ain't bothered
Rest in Peace Kami
Your death unexpected to say sadly

[Verse 7]
For now this is just the start
Fire in the booth, how many parts?
For now I wanna spray heat
There's no shame in loss or defeat
Hold tight Chief Keef on the beat
We ain't in class but you best take a seat
For this track, this is the end
Know one day I'll be setting trends
I've got family but not many friends

[Outro]
