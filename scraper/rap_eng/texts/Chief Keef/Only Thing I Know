The only thing I know
The only thing I know
The only thing I know

[Hook: Fedy]
The only thing I know is how to get this money
I'm a get it going, told amigo keep it coming
The only thing I know is busting down a brick
If shit get fucked up finesse a nigga out of chips
The only thing I know is busting down a bail
Throwing it in the bag and putting it on the scale
The only thing I know is how to break a bitch
Put her on the strip and told the bitch to get me rich

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Bitch, I'm a nut
Everyday is payday
I'll kill a nigga, put that on Kaykay
Shots fired, man down, bitch nigga, Mayday
Pull them pistols up, I bet them boys vacate
Only thing I know is all these niggas stunt
Kill him for his bricks then roll me up a blunt
I'm smoking on the skunk, on this money hunt
I'm a Glory Boy, and I be gloried up
Tatted like amigos, amigos front me kilos
We just money repo, bank account 8 zeroes
Call me Chief Sosa De Niro, flier than a seagull
Give my young boys kilos; they serving to your people
These niggas ain't 'sleep, though, know they know 'bout me though
Who that? I don't even know. I'm finna go see though
Hope he holding kilos, Rose bring 'em to me though
That's why I am CEO. Fuck you fuck boys mean though?
