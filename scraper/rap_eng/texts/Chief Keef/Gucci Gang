[Intro: Chief Keef]
Free Wop, aye Justo
Free my nigga Slick

Free, free my nigga you know

You know, you got to spend money to make money
Glo Gang y'all know how we rocking man

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Boy gon' duck when my orange on him
Shoot you now it's orange on ya (red on ya)
Now it's dead on ya
Dead mans in my pockets, and I spend all 'em
On 4,000 Gucci jackets
She gave me top then Gucci tapped it
Tag team, then I hop in my car drag wrestling, racing
You pacing, I'm racing to the cake and I'm icey
You basic
Every fucking thing I wear costs a thousand, or better aye
Fo a Gucci sweater 3,000... 3,000 Burberry
Riding fast the cops is chasing me
They can get wet with them pistols playin' Hail Mary, aye
Cause I'm tired of getting locked up
That's the reason that officer got shot up
Running with this paper like a running back
Boy, you can't get none of that
Foghorn, I'ma let this dog out at you
Bull Dog, coming through fuck the law

Justo tryna get them rolls
See a opp, he gon' score
After doing hits, make the kill, call D-moe
I think I need a pill and I need some smoke
Bring some pound, bring some Remey, bring the hoes
It's all about the Glo, Free D-rose
Who is you? I don't know
Move around, cock it back, I'ma blow, GRATATA!
Kill your father and your mother and your fucking son

[Verse 4: Chief Keef]

Bitch I think I'm Godfather, off this dope Tony Montana
But I'm Sosa and I glo way harder
