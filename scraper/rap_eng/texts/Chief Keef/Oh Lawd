[Intro]
Oh lawd
Looking back then you’ll be like oh lawd

[Hook]
Looking back then, you’ll be like oh lawd
Look at me now, you’ll be like oh lawd
Looking back then, you’ll be like oh lawd
Look at me now, you’ll be like oh lawd
That bitch seen my chain and she was like oh lawd, oh lawd
I gave her that thang and she was like oh lawd
Niggas seen my earrings and they was like oh boy, oh boy
But he know never try to rob Almighty So, boy

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Come through killin' shit, droppin' shit
Or I do a hit list bitch on my Dodgers shit
Niggas steady talking about poppin' out
We gon' start poppin' shit
Nigga gon' be on that roster again
Like fuck the Feds
They mad cause a young nigga made it and got ahead
They wanna lock me up and throw away the key
That's not fair, I made it up outta there
Now I'm ridin' round totin' choppas
Ridin' round shootin' blocks up
Everybody mad cause I'm gettin' that gwap up
Like that's gon' make me stop it
Nuh-uh, no
Give it to me, money, choppa waterfall
Don't give a fuck 'bout no cars but I am warning y'all
We some Energizer bunnies y'all
Even though I believe in God I'm...
I'm still goin' out with my Glock up
I just spent 40 thousand on Balenciaga's
Baby I don't like no Prada

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
I took her to the crib, she like "oh lawd"
She never seen a mansion with glass floors
I’m stuck up in my glory, I ignore her
I got some top and kicked her out the door
I put her in the whip, she like "oh lawd"
She said she done fuckin' with lil boys
They ain't got no guap, ain't makin' no noise
She hit my dope, it knock her out like Floyd, oh lawd
For these shoes I paid bout four, oh lawd
I bought a pint and po'd a fourth
Pockets fat like ass on contour
200 on the dash in my car, oh lawd

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
My pockets fat like the ass of Kim K, oh lawd
How I'm runnin' through this cake, oh lawd
Car I'ma drive today, oh lawd
Remember when I ain't have nothin' before
Now I can have it all
Problem is that I won't stop 'til I fall
Don't care bout none of y'all

[Hook]
