[Verse]
Imma come and get you with the seat way back
I'm a rich nigga but I came from way back
We could record all moments and press play back
I couldn't find you like a needle in the hay stack
I couldn't find you like sale on a whole store
We can hit every city on a tour bus
We can hit every state on the jet plane
I swear this shit won't be over 'till the cat sings
I know you know that a cat can't sing though
You are not every bird, girl you a flamingo
Then I hit it on the head she like bingo
At six flags "Aight let's hit giant drop", she like please no
I had to hit your heart with a repo
I called Michael Blessing for the scene though
Babe what you mad for, I'm Mr. Meaner
You know when I get inside her I'm Mr. Cleaner
Bang bang
Bang bang
