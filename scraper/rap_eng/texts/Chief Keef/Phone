[Intro]
I'm double in it
I ain't had no sleep in 'bout a week
Got your thottie to my house, she's bout to freak
'Bout to freak, 'bout to freak
I ain't had no sleep in 'bout a week
Just got your thottie to my house, she's bout to freak
Fucking with her, geek
Beep

[Hook]
I ain't have no sleep in bout a week
Just got your thottie to my house shes bout to freak
I'm fucking with whoever ride with me
Is you gon blow your pistol boy we's bout to see
I dont owe you boy I got here on my own
Back in them days I was out here on my own
Now these boys dont like I'm on the throne
Ain't no peace treaties boy don't call my phone

[Verse 1]
Smookin on Tooka with my click clack fuck the chi-chat
Fuck nigga you better get back before your ass get whacked
Niggas all about that chi-chat over that iner-net
I ain't with that damn chi-chat on that iner-net
Blammin at these fuck niggas like “Bow, Bow, Bang”
And I got them damn wow-wow's in my chain
And I got them damn wow-wow's in my earrings
Finna get them damn wow-wow's on some rings
Put some wow-wow's on that range
Put some wow-wow-wow's on that motherfucking beamer
Hoes say I talk like im from Ala-Bama
Nah bitch this ain't country grammer

[Bridge]
Jackson just like Samuel
Did you read the motherfucking manual
Lemme check my schedule
Choppa go dududuh let go

[Hook]
I ain't have no sleep in bout a week
Just got your thottie to my house shes bout to freak
I'm fucking with whoever ride with me
Is you gon blow your pistol boy we's bout to see
I dont owe you boy I got here on my own
Back in them days I was out here on my own
Now these boys dont like I'm on the throne
Ain't no peace treaties boy dont call my phone
