[Intro]
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
Now it's over
It's over

[Hook]
I keep a big bankroll and some designer clothes on
Last year I didn't have shit well now it's over
Keep me some hoes, a lot of hoes here
Last year I cuffed that bitch, well now its over
Now its over, now its over
Last year I didn't have shit, well now its over
Now its over, now its over
Last year I cuffed that bitch, well now its over

[Verse 1]
Learned how to record myself, well now its over
I'ma kill these beats like a fucking soldier
She gone give me top then I'mma slump her over
And we ain't with the talk boy, we'll slump you over
I be riding Rarris, Rovers
I got lots of guap, you know it
And we ain't with the talk, we blowing
I got guap, just watch me throw it
They say I'm handsome cause my bands up
And I dont hold no ho for ransom
And if we see a opp, we blam him
If he ainâ€™t one of ours, then damn him

[Hook]
