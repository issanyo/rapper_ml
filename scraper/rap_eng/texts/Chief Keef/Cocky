[Intro]
This is your last chance
After this, there is no turning back
You take the blue pill, you story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe
You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland

[Hook]
My niggas goonie loonies
Six thou for my Rollie
Fifty thou for my Breitling
Bitch, three chains cost a Lotus
For a verse, cost a brick
For a show, cost a G
It's not an accident girl, baby you know I'm cocky
Cause I'm splurging, I'm splurging
I'm in a fast car and I'm swerving
Cops just got behind me, now I'm nervous
I think they did that shit on purpose
But I'm cocky and I know it
Baby, I ain't afraid to show it
L-E-D lights on, I'm always glowing
I'm cocky, I'm cocky
Baby girl, I'm cocky

[Verse 1]
I pull up in that what-to-call-it
He pull up in that Honda
In my pocket, what to call this?
In his pocket, nothing
My house six thousand, what's to call it?
He still living with his mama
My truck cost two hundred, what's to call this?
Just for me to ride around in
Cocky, Balboa Rocky
Come through knocking shit down, Ali
Now we gotta run from Aiki
Fuck 12, we going on a high speed
Cause my car cocky
He think he can outrun everybody
My jewelry arrogant, and it's very cocky
But my pistol the friendliest one

[Hook]
My niggas goonie loonies
Six thou for my Rollie
Fifty thou for my Breitling
Bitch, three chains cost a Lotus
For a verse, cost a brick
For a show, cost a G
It's not an accident girl, baby you know I'm cocky
Cause I'm splurging, I'm splurging
I'm in a fast car and I'm swerving
Cops just got behind me, now I'm nervous
I think they did that shit on purpose
But I'm cocky and I know it
Baby, I ain't afraid to show it
L-E-D lights on, I'm always glowing
I'm cocky, I'm cocky
Baby girl, I'm cocky
