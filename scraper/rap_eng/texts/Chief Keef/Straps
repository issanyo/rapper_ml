[Hook: Chief Keef x2]
We got straps on straps on straps
And now we on the map
I'm getting to that money nigga that's a fucking fact
I promise I'm the swag
Throw it in the back
I buy a lots of shit, not even looking at the tags

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
We got straps on straps on straps
I need to go to rehab
I swear I spend so much money
I can't do nothing but laugh
At these fufu ass niggas
Don't make my niggas spaz
The pistols get to busting they go blat blat blat blat blat
I'm burning this shit (?)
Giving niggas the clap
All these clothes that I'm buying, I need designer rehab
Flexing hard, 'till I crash
Pull up in that Jag
Niggas know I get cash
Rob me, know what happens
We got straps on straps on straps
I promise I'ma blast
Leave you in the past
I'm at the top, you niggas last
That's why these niggas broke
See this ain't no joke
I'm smoking on the dope
(?)

[Verse 2: Gino Marley]
We got straps on straps on straps
Ride around collecting bands
Blowing stupid fruity pack
Trues fit with the hat
Leave 10's just to match
Keep them straps stay in tact
Flashing 'till we clap
Get hit no coming back
Team floating off them flats
Spend money make it back
We on top that's a fact
Hella cash what's a tag
Bitch throw it in the back
Sit back and count some racks
GBE we on the map
They go louder than the pack
That's a 30 in the strap
So you know we never lack
Come around you seeing that
And them thots they love our swag
That's a 30 in the strap
So you know we never lack
Come around you seeing that
And them thots they love our swag
