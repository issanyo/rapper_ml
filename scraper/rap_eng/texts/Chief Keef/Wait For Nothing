[Hook]
She say she in love with a young nigga, she wanna have fun
Think she want my funds, think this bitch think I'm dumb
She say she in love with a young nigga, she love my sun
Now she want a sun, this bitch finna make me run
Gotta get the fuck away from her
Hit the trap in the kitchen, baking up
I be thinking 'bout money when I'm waking up
Bitch I'm Almighty, I don't wait for nothing

[Verse 1]
Hit a (?)
Tadoe grab the Mac, finna spray this bun
Take his thrax, take his racks
Take his packs, take his back
Fuck, might just pull off in this car
Might just pull off with his thot
She was in the whip too
Fuck, she wishing too
She say she will let a pistol rip too
So I'm like come on, let's roll
You know you snitch on me, it's over
Let's hop in the Range Rover
Don't let a bitch drink 'til she had a hangover

[Hook]
She say she in love with a young nigga, she wanna have fun
Think she want my funds, think this bitch think I'm dumb
She say she in love with a young nigga, she love my sun
Now she want a sun, this bitch finna make me run
Gotta get the fuck away from her
Hit the trap in the kitchen, baking up

Paper (?)

Pull up to your party and we taking hoes
Ain't tryna fuck it out bitch, we breaking hoes
I got a fifty thousand fucking Breitling on
You don't know me bitch, what your whole life been on?

Hoes get a number, that shit ain't right with hoes
Swear I can't spend my life of hoes
Bitch I ride and spend my life with my bros

[Hook]
She say she in love with a young nigga, she wanna have fun
