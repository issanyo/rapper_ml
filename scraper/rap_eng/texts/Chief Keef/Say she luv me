[Intro]
She say she love me whatever that is
Do me a favor and save that shit

[Hook]
She say she love me whatever that is
Do me a favor, save that shit
Like bad kids, bitch we wreckless
Ball hard sorta like Texas
You say you know Sosa, he be lackin'
Do me a favor, save that shit
You fuck niggas better stay back yea

[Verse 1 ]
She says she know Sosa, he be flexin'
Pull up windows down smell freshin'
Good loud packs smell like cat piss
Hanging out the roof young and wreckless
Rocking in my rock jeans
Campaign Sosa, every nigga following

She say she luv me whatever that is
We see a opp, shit get hectic
Alot of extended clips no acting
No sex bitch I only want the neck bitch

[Hook]
She say she love me whatever that is
Do me a favor, save that shit
Like bad kids, bitch we wreckless
Ball hard sorta like Texas
You say you know Sosa, he be lackin'
Do me a favor, save that shit
You fuck niggas better stay back yea
Alot of steady clips no actin'
