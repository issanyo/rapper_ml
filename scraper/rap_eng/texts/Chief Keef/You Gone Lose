[Hook]
All my niggas maniacs, flooded with them tools
Nigga you a fool, try us you gone lose
All we do is win, my niggas don't lose
We twisting nails at any nigga, don't get screwed
All my niggas maniacs, flooded with them tools
Nigga you a fool, try us you gone lose
All we do is win, my niggas don't lose
We twisting nails at any nigga, bitch don't get screwed

[Verse 1]
Coming in my hood, know this shit ain't safe
We wet your ass with bullets, throw you in a lake
Riding around with nines, we don't fuck with eights
Hood on my back, running in a race
Y-Yo we keep them tools nigga, don't get screwed
Riding-Riding through my shit, them guns aimed at you
We blow y'all off, then your ass gone lose
Rolling-Rolling off a nigga, shoot a nigga ooohh
On my momma, bitch I'm L's to death
And all my niggas foul, we ain't playing fair
On my momma, bitch I'm L's to death
And all my niggas foul, we ain't playing fair

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rolling kush cuz I feel like getting high
I was born in this shit, see it in my eye
I don't wanna die but I ain't scared to die
Sosa bitch (?)
Riding with my niggas, we all love the shooting
We sliding doors back and shooting out the roof
Red beams, green beams aimed at you
Please don't get screwed, all my niggas loose
This the life of them (?) niggas
Middle fingers to the cops, we don't snitch nigga
This the life of them (?) niggas
Middle fingers to the cops, we don't snitch nigga

[Hook]
