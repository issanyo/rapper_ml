[Hook]
I got two chains on, I got two thang's on me
Shawty gave me head like she got two brains on her
Can't wear these trues no more, bitch I got food stains on 'em
This nigga say he don't like me, this bitch got who ringtone
I got play-do, I don't play though
And I just smoked earth boy, not no mango
And right now, I like Beamer trucks not no Range Rovers
On my way to pick up 50 thousand but the bank closed

[Verse 1]
What you say though, I got a K hoe
Shoot a nigga dead then go smoke my brains out
I donâ€™t wife no bitch, I ain't got no main ho
Ion't fuck with niggas, I see hater, Maino
Get Franklins hey ho, checkout my bank roll
I ain't answer my FaceTime, so this bitch try to tango
And I know I'm a rapper, I still got them thangs though
Spilled a drink on me, I slapped her cause I had to change clothes
Then the cops coming
Had to smoke a nigga cause he a lame, I'm not one
What you think I bought this double trigger, I'ma spark something
Tadoe off that molly, tryna pop something
Try to take my jewelry you'll get shot up

[Hook]
I got two chains on, I got two thang's on me
Shawty gave me head like she got two brains on her
Can't wear these trues no more, bitch I got food stains on 'em
This nigga say he don't like me, this bitch got who ringtone
I got play-do, I don't play though
And I just smoked earth boy, not no mango
And right now, I like Beamer trucks not no Range Rovers
On my way to pick up 50 thousand but the bank closed
