I be ballin' like I play for the Thunder
I was ridin' with his momma
Let her roll a blunt of ganja
She say I'm narley then I say cowabunga
I know right, yeah lil momma saw me pull up in that tonka
I know I'm heavy like my ice gotta a lot of drinking ice
You say can you spend the night, nah baby that shit ain't right
She say what's the hold up
I got these bands in my pants
I need end on everything that I told ya

[Verse  1]
Money giddy up, giddy up, giddy up, giddy up
I smoke 93, you smoke 51
Pop out the truck, out the truck with the semi up
Lil nigga act up, Chief So hit him up
Motherfuckers snuck in the club with the snub, hit the dj up
Made a million dollars for my motherfucking penny though
Pull up to the strip, hop out, whats the dealio
Fat ass Backwoods looking like a Philly ho
Let his bitch hit the weed she a silly ho
She start talkin' about being in my videos
Pull up like a video pop me a wheelie though
She start screaming, I got me a silly ho
Ion't talk bands bitch I talk milli though
I can be outside in the biddy like Diddy though
Bitch stay saying she love me really though
Say she like me for me but bitch what's really good

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I got the ruger and the ruger hit yo medulla
Ain't gotta be on the radio to turn it up
Pull up to the party, you know I'ma turn it up
When I stop ballin', you know I'ma do him
I'ma see so much money, I done through it up
Pull on an opp block and you know I blew it up
Came to the club, bitch you know that I'm toolied up
Dirty ho act like she won't gone give the coochie up
Sosa Jefferson, bitch you know I'm movied up
Posted up ? bitch you know that I'm booted up
Ready for the war, I'm suited, I'm booted up
Bitch ain't tryna fuck you know I rude it up
I sip lean nigga you can't brew it up
I don't like to much if the shit ain't new enough
Say you got a background fuck nigga pull it up
Talking 'bout war or money, I'm pulling up
