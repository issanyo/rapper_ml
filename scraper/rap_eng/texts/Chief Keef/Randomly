[Intro: Tadoe & Chief Keef]
Got a 100 pounds coming in from Jamaica
Smoking on this damn purple, like the fuckin' Lakers
I just fucked on your thot now she wanna date me
See these rings I rub my hands together like I'm Baby

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
White VVS, Grey SRT, It’s a hellcat you hear us pass your street
We playing defense we can’t let it be
You might see me pass you smoking dope randomly
You might hear me stop and hit the gas randomly
I might ride pass and hear bitches spazz randomly
You might see me hop out getting gas randomly
You might see me pickin' up a bag randomly

[Verse 1: Chief Keef & Tadoe]
I might randomly be in a track hawk it
I just wanna fuck her that’s all yeah
Swish swish swish the basketball yeah
Mama ask did you eat your vegetables yeah
You might randomly see me in your hood
I ain’t gotta explain what be understood
With the AR15 call me Elmer Fudd
Your bitch said you was sexy chocolate now you fudge
White diamonds ‘round my neck like a fuckin racist
Smoking on this thoink counting all this damn paper
And I’m steady chasing guap so niggas steady hating
Slap forgis  on a hawk now I’m fuckin' skating

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
White VVS, Grey SRT, It’s a hellcat you hear us pass your street
We playing defence we can’t let it be
You might see me pass you smoking dope randomly
You might hear me stop and hit the gas randomly
I might ride pass and have bitches spaz randomly
You might see me hop out getting gas randomly
You might see me pickin' up a bag randomly

[Verse 2: Chief Keef & Tadoe]
Smoke out the 448 that’s randomly
Walk in the club 20 grand that’s randomly
Left out the club I ain’t got no bands on me
Play with them blue berries split yo tangerine
Got the trap house jumping like a trampoline
Fourth person I can’t be on the feds magazine
We at your head bitch, like maybe yeah it's Maybeline
She heard my engine she got more water, then a sour creme
First I woke up with yo hoe head by my dick
He the type of nigga who gon kill you 'bout his bitch
Lift my wrist up that bitch feeling like a brick (Brr)
Big bags like I'm Santa but I’m feeling like the Grinch
Might randomly pull up fa-fa-fa like World War Two
She randomly see maneuvering and text me like "wasn't that you"
Pick her up she saw me pour a cup like up give me some of that juice (lean)
She hopped in smelled that mother fucking
Smoke she was like give me some of that too (dope)
On the highway, dodgin that, black and white Ford it
But all I see is green
I don’t see black and white boy
[?] just told me fuck niggas my appetite boy
Squeeze that bitch like a fruit, make strawberry lemonade boy
Ayy fam

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
White VVS, Grey SRT, It’s a hellcat you hear us pass your street
We playing defence we can’t let it be
You might see me pass you smoking dope randomly
You might hear me stop and hit the gas randomly
I might ride pass and bitches spaz randomly
You might see me hop out getting gas randomly
You might see me pickin' up a bag randomly
