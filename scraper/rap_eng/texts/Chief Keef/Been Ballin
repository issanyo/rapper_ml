[Verse 1: Ballout]
Ballout baby, I've been balling since the sixth grade
Earrings was so big you couldn't even see my damn face
Did you get the mix tape? Ballin no NBA
I been ballin not with the ball but with the damn K
In the kitchen cooking cakes, but its not my birthday
I never seen your bitch but, I bet I can fuck her on the first day
Damn near passed out when I pulled up on 28s
Gold everything but I don't look shit like Trinidad James
Ballin like Lebron James, smokin' on that 2 Chainz
But I have on 1 chain, I don't have on 2 chains
I will get another chain when I hit another stain
O'Block 300 bitch, GBE the gang

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Chief Sosa baby I been ballin hard no discounts

And I got a maid, so I ain't takin shit out
Ain't tryna fuck get out, this a suck a dick house
Money house, bitch house, a pound house, brick house
I even got a AK sittin at my bitch house
Don't make me switch out pull up get out
Start throwing cash everywhere and fucking every bitch now
Look at my wrist blah, chain blah, ears blah, my car blah
My earrings so damn big that I can't hear now
Boy lets get serious now you know you ain't gettin count
20 in my left pocket hundreds wore that shit out
