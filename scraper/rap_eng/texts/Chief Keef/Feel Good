[Verse 1]
Feel Good
(Bang Bang)
She gon' make me feel good
Make me feel good
Women be like, “Sosa do it real good"
Smoking on this dope make me feel good
She give me top, she know she make me feel good
She gone bust it open make me feel good
Ridding Rari’s and Rovers make me feel good
I got lots of guap man I feel good
I know that I’m rich but I’m still good
And women be like Sosa do it real good
I just might call yo' bitch
