[Hook]
Way before my raps, man I knew how to swag
She say she ain't calling back no more, I'm glad
Got my Maisons on with the Trues to match
I don't watch the tag it don't matter, clerk give me that
I'm the biggest flexer, I'm your dad
I'ma teach you niggas how to flex and how to swag
Swag school
I'm gone teach you niggas how to pass
Aston with them Shantis on, I'ma teach you how to drive

[Verse 1]
I'm getting money, got a lot of niggas mad though
My cash up and you sad cuz your cash low
Ain't talking T-Pain but I'm Fifty with that cash flow
I'm flexing like I'm George, Griselda Blanco I'ma asshole
Ding ding, bitch my engine where the ass go
And my shit so old I put my bags up where the gas go
TNT no TMT, I got that cash though
I flex for Blood, so I'm in this bitch with all my chains on
Little  girl, who you thought ain't put no ring on?
Get some girls, I will get you some to slang on
In the party with my pistol like I'm J-Ro
And if a nigga play, boy then I'm gone put my K on

[Hook]
Way before my raps, man I knew how to swag

I don't watch the tag it don't matter, clerk give me that
I'm the biggest flexer, I'm your dad
I'ma teach you niggas how to flex and how to swag
Swag school
I'm gone teach you niggas how to pass
Aston with them Shantis on, I'ma teach you how to drive
