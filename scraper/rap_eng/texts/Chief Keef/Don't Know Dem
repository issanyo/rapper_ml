(CHORUS)
This nigga looking at me like he want some
Pistol to his face if he owe some
My boys they keep them tools make em blow some
OTF they ride for Sosa

Riding with my hitters bitch we on some
Ride on an opp and then smoke them
Yea we keep them horns we will blow them
Who is these niggas, I don't know them

(VERSE)
GBE bitch we hot bitch we smokin
I'm chokin, what I'm smoking potent
I'm leaning, rolling and I'm totin'
You know where it's O and the no end

300 bitch don't make me bring them killers out
Real shit, free all my hitters out
Don't make me bring them killers out
Youse a dead man that ain't even written so

Tec chop like lawn mowers
Feds listening, shit, short convo
Hit a nigga with a combo
What I'mma fight for? My choppers drum roll

(CHORUS)

(VERSE)
Throwing L's up, Glocks up
Don't start us, can't stop us
Everywhere they spot us
Chopper light, kill a cop though

Word around this nigga Stevie
I don't a fuck with contacts, see me
I love getting tree-tree
Smoke kush get head by Kiki

I need that, I'm up now
A problem, we up now
My gun screaming "what?" now
You want that tough shit? Our guns act tough now
