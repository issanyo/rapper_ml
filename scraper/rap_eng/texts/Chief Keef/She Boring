[Chief Keef]
I love foreigns, foreigns, foreigns
You boys ride Chevrolet's cause yall normal
You can have yo' bitch back cause she boring
I'm everywhere I'm tourin' while yall boring
Big band franklin bank rolls off in my robins
You boys ain't gettin' no money, stop it

Because they know I got stacks in my pocket
And I love smokin', smokin', smokin'
And not no normal, normal, normal
