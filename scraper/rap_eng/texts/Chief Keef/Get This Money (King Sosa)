[Hook]
All blue hunnids, get this money
All green twenties, get this money
All white hunnids, get this money
All pink fifties, get this money
All green ones, get this money
All green fives, get this money
Get this money, get this money, get this money (yeah, yeah)
Get this money, get this money, get this money (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Boy you ain't smokin dope, what the fuck you talkin’ 'bout weed
Say you got everything why the fuck you talkin' bout need
Pillow talk to these hoes, why you wanna talk about me
AK go A B C de-de-de-dede-D
Tell a bitch pull out get your bag here
Girl come and get your hair pulled
Put your face in the mattress
I just met a bad bitch
I hope it ain’t catfish
Pull up in a M6
M boy reckless
Your boyfriend found love
You tell him "Calm Down"
Before he get his ass beat
Me in a compound
He wouldn't last one round
Tell him, turn the fuck down
Boy, I'm gettin' money, I can't give a fuck now
