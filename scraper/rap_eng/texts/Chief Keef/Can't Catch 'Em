[Intro]
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
Catch 'em, can't

[Hook]
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
If I stretched her, she ain't special
It's endings to this shit with this .50, it ain't levels
For the runners, and their medals
Gold diggers, and their jewels
I ain't ever going broke, bitch never, say never
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
My car's too special
My house too big
So thots be stretchin
And I live there by myself
Me and a lot of weapons
Money to buy whatever
Surrounded by lots of protection

[Verse 1]
Nigga say he want it beef, then slide then
I'm in a car driving fast, no license with the pipe and
'Member I used to fuck around, had a white hand
I got my money in this Louie Suitcase but its trifling
Cause I done spilled codeine all over it
And I was rolling weed all over it
2004, LV's all over it
I really don't fuck with G's if y'all ain't notice it

[Hook]
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
If I stretched her, she ain't special
It's endings to this shit with this .50, it ain't levels
For the runners, and their medals
Gold diggers, and their jewels
I ain't ever going broke, bitch never, say never
Catch 'em, can't catch 'em
My car's too special
My house too big
So thots keep stretchin
And I live there by myself
Me and a lot of weapons
Money to buy whatever
Surrounded by lots of protection
