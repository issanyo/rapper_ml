Rolled up on your girl, riding in that skrt (skrt)
Hop out with that swag, pay the bills like for a fur
Boy don't make me swerve, you smokin' on some dirt
She told me that she loved me, and then I closed the curtains
I'm something like an old head, pull up in that oh yeah
Hey are you Sosa? I'm the man, oh yeah
I've seen Burberry, but I ain't gonna go there
I walk in Louis, and buy a couple coats, yeah

[Verse 1]
Damn, I hate being sober
Hop out, show love
Buying all the Louis, Jazze Pha, Sho Nuff
The feds tryna get me, but I don't know none
I do not speak English, I don't show ya
But I'm partying like it's my last day
Text yo bitch one emoji and she text a
Butterflies up in her gut from my wrist, damn shame
Got Hillary up in my Bentley, I'm the campaign
Hit the club, it's crackin', she hop on the wagon
She sees I'm swaggin', but I'm not matching
Run up on me, who's lackin'?
What's up? What's brackin'?
I was a True Religion Fiend 'til I started getting racks in

[Hook]
Rolled up on your girl, riding in that skrt (skrt)

[Verse 2]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
No no no no
That's not no dope
Get out of this robe
I'm up in Fendi, they offer champagne
But I'm sipping lean, and I do not drink
I'm off of the drugs, and he want some puff
And she wants a hug, and I want the love
I knew we would fuck when she got in my tub
Glory Boyz Musical, young Zac Efron
I'm off the dope
I'm off the drink
Hey love, what's the name?
Do you smoke?
Does it stank?
Then what was falling, wasn't rain
