[Intro]
Niggas fufu as fuck, as fuck, as fuck
Get Doowop out the cut, gun up, light up
Bang, you's a lil boy
As fuck, as fuck
Glo up, bang
Gun up, light up

[Hook]
Niggas fufu as fuck, as fuck, as fuck
Get Doowop out the cut, gun up, light up
You's a lil boy, glo up, light up
Got my .30 on my side if a nigga try to take my stuff
I'm shooting out, straight up, straight up, straight up
Niggas know we ain't selling, ask then it's straight up
I got this .40 on me and I'ma end this bitch straight up
And if you know me know this shit ain't made up
Straight up

[Verse 1]
Straight up
Can't fuck with dem niggas 'cause dem niggas ain't straight up
Niggas ask if I'm O'Block, I say straight up
Posted with dem Glocks and .30's, boy, come make it spray up
Straight up, straight up, straight up
Stop all that flexing, boy, you ain't getting paper
Yo ass stealing out, fool, but you say you doing K bucks
And I'm still smoking dope even though I'm on (?)

[Hook]
Niggas fufu as fuck, as fuck, as fuck
Get Doowop out the cut, gun up, light up
You's a lil boy, glo up, light up
Got my .30 on my side if a nigga try to take my stuff
I'm shooting out, straight up, straight up, straight up
Niggas know we ain't selling, ask then it's straight up
I got this .40 on me and I'ma end this bitch straight up
And if you know me know this shit ain't made up
Straight up
