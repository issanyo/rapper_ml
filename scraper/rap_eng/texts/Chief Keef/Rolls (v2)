[Hook]
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I got all the rolls, I be on the road
I can count this money with my eyes closed
Ride by you, bye-bye hoe
'Cause I'm bout my rolls, bitch I'm bout my rolls
You ain't talking rolls then I gotta go
I thought you knew, baby I am 'bout my rolls

[Verse 1]
I'm 'bout my pesos, my rolls
You ain't talking pesos, I shoot you in ya nose, and ya mouth
'Cause you wasn't talking right
Better bring that money to the light, bitch nigga
'Cause I'm a rich nigga
For a show I need 6 figures
You talking 30 bands, I'ma take it
But your show I might not make it
Hoes think I am Jamaican
Rastafari dreads, they be shaking
Pull up on they block, nigga, shake it
Click clack, this ning ding finna get baking
Bitch, I eat bacon
But I don't fuck with big, see them then I shake it
They gon' try to strip me naked
Take me to the cell, I can take it
It ain't nothing
Aye, nigga try me then it's bussing, 10-10
Call a 10-10, code 10
'Cause that ning ding be my twin twin
That's the only friend I got, other than guap
Momma told me trust no one
Snakes in the grass, one of 'em gon' bite

[Hook]
I got all the hoes, I got all the hoes
I got all the rolls, I be on the road
I can count this money with my eyes closed
Ride by you, bye-bye hoe
'Cause I'm bout my rolls, bitch I'm bout my rolls
You ain't talking rolls then I gotta go
I thought you knew, baby I am 'bout my rolls

[Verse 2]
I thought you mothafuckin knew
Pull up bitch i'm bout my rolls
You ain't talking rolls then we bout to blow
At your mothafuckin skull and your fucking nose
And your teeth nigga
We gonna make your dumbass bleed nigga
30 in this ning ding nigga
It's a drill bitch, ding ding nigga
