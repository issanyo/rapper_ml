[Hook: LeekeLeek]
This shit ain’t been the same since the money came
These hoes all tryna cop no time just give me brain
Now the money I’m spending bitch I go insane
My niggas all riding foreign European thangs (2x)

[Verse 1: LeekeLeek]
That shit ain't been the same since that balling B
Sosa party, now only bitches follow me
Old family, been hating on me, they frenemies
Sneak dissin' ain’t with the it, see me in the streets
I’m turnt up can’t turn down, ho catch up
(?) racks up
I sip slow, I live fast, don’t act up
Lot of niggas don’t like me, that’s wassup
I don’t like you either, no I don’t like you either
Stop dick riding on LeekeLeek cause I’m hot as fever
You fuck nigga, you duck nigga, no I don’t need you
I’m balling now you broke nigga, stop sharing reefer

[Hook: LeekeLeek (x2)]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Bentleys, Benz and Beamers they them foreign things
Bitch I got lots of cash I know you know my name
I done got indicted selling cocaine
And dope man, it started off my propane
I’m still O'Block nigga, ain’t shit changed
She go'n give me brain no need to spit game
I’m too busy tryna fuck your bitch man
You ain’t in the rich lane, then nigga switch lanes
Gucci, Louie, Trus and expensive kicks
Man I swear these fuck niggas ain’t on shit
Bitches on my dick they wanna fuck my clique
But if she wanna fuck my clique she gotta suck my dick
