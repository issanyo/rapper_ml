Smoking on this dope, it got me deezy
Deezy (2x)
Sosa baby, Gbe baby
Huhh, bang bang

[Hook]
Smoking on this dope, it got me deezy
Stop talking all that, roll me up a bleezy
I make this shit look easy
I swear these hoes, they love them some Chief Keef
I'm feeling like John Cena, you can't see me
Getting head by Kee-Kee gettin tree-tree
All these niggas wanna be me
Can't trust no bitch these bitches fuck on anything
