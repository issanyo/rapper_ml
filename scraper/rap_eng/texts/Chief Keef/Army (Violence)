[Verse]
Niggas coming through with that violence
Niggas mixxed two with that molly
Ain't got nothing to do with that money
I'm coming through with that choppa
Niggas come and deal with that violence
Just bought a gun that's silent
Police grab me about that violence
Ain't know nothing about it
Hop out my car, it's cloudy
I'm a hundred nigga, big bounty
Ain't nothing funny but money
Look fuck nigga get money
We come through and we redrum'ing
Murder a nigga, upping that doggy
I take my car and I self park it
Hop out then get to sparking
Remember when I used to watch Barney
Now I'm running around with my army
Get it to you however you want it
I am 2Pac for the moment
Nigga told me I got talent
Remember when I used to be abandoned
Ready to make that damage
To him, him, and him

Naw baby, I don't eat candy
Ain't shit sweet but sweet damage
