[Hook]
It's 'bout the glory, I ain't for nun, I pull up in foreigns
Since I get so much dough boy, I act like a moron
She acting she ain't going, man that bitch is going
I don't love no hoes boy, man these bitches boring
So this is it, we ain't for nun, we gon' get to blowing
Stick out like a sore thumb, bitch we them Glo Boys
No we can't go un un, we so used to scoring
We counting them hundreds, you niggas is snoring

[Verse 1]
All these niggas know, I be smoking on the dope
All these bitches know that I be fucking all these hoes
Everybody know that I keep a big bankroll
And all the opps know, we up them poles and let 'em blow
And we smoke
We got a lot of O's, and we get a lot of clothes
We have about 100 shots for niggas to let 'em know
Just to let you know, we roll with a pot of gold
On that pretentious shit, shots will go
