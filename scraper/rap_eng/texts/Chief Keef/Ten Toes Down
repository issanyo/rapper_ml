[Intro]
Need to be happy...

[Hook]
Ten toes down, I got shows and verses
I'ma bring 'em to your town
For the right fuckin' amount, you can hit me up right now
50 for a show and 20 for a 12
I'm a loose screw, I ain't no nail
Walk up in the building
She either smelled the loud or Chanel
I think she goin' for the kill
She steady callin' my phone
My battery she damn near killed me
My phone steady ringin'
This bitch damn near killed me

[Verse 1]
What's on my line, that “ffffffffrrrr beeeep"
They be callin' all the time
Bang bang, what's that, my gun
I up this mothafucka, blew it, make him run, better run
Little Gump, run Forrest, run
3 grams in the blunt, we have 1 on 1
I love gettin' money, and I know you know it man
You don’t like me then show it, why the fuck you hold it in
I walk in and break the bank, then walk out and close you in
What the fuck you lookin' at, I swear I don't know you man
I'm sayin' I'ma a Glo man, I don't need no tan
I pull up, hop out, standin' in my stance

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Skrrt pullin' off, I'm so raw
Ha-ha high a lot, ruff ruff I'm a dog
Chh-chh go my paws
Cause these fuckas itch a lot
Bitch I got my bong, I don't want you, take me home
I be smokin' skunk, got it from the loft
'Member sellin' junkies, now I gotten dope
'Member red monkeys, closet full of Trues
If you lookin' for me, I'm probably on the news
One plus two, that equals a few
I want ten times 500,000 cool
I pull up rude, my jewelry du-du
Brick and balony in my pocket, Milonakis stew

[Hook]
