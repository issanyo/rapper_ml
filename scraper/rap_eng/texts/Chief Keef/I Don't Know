I Call You Back
I Don't Know (x2)

(Hook)
Is It My Watch My Earrings Maybe I Don't Know
Is It My Swag My Big Bank Maybe I Don't Know
Is It My Walk My Mean Talk Maybe I Don't Know
Cause I Got Guap In My Car Maybe I Don't Know
Is It My Watch My Earrings Maybe I Don't Know
Is It My Swag My Big Bank Maybe I Don't Know
Is It My Walk My Mean Talk Maybe I Don't Know
Cause I Got Guap And I Ball Maybe I Don't Know

(Verse 1:Chief Keef)
Cause I'm Ballin' With My Niggas That's It
Like My Money All Hundreds That's It
She Shoot Me Down And I'm Gone Punish That Bitch
Put some Ben Franklins In Front Of That Bitch
We Hit The Strip Clubs 3hunna Deep
And All These Bad Bitches Be Starring At Me
Cause They Know Chief Keef Be Throwin' A Couple Of Gs
It's Guarantee Them Bitches Leaving With Me
I Say They Knowing When The Rarris Pull Up
Man All The Bitches Wanna Party With Us
Cause They Know We Get The Party Turnt Up
Catch A Opp You Get Your Party Burnt Up

(Hook)
