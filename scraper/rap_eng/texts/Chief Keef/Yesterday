[Intro]
Ladada
Gats go bang

[Hook]
I'm fucking on these hoes, I'm swagging on these hoes
Let a nigga try me, gat is gonna blow
I'm nuttin' on these hoes, splashing on these hoes
Pull off in that 'rari, dragging on these hoes
You gotta know me though, my gat is on me though
And I'm still off these blunts from yesterday
Shoot a nigga ass for today and yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday

[Verse]
Bitch wanna fuck me, lets see what my schedule say
She a dumb thottie, I met her yesterday
Got a pound of dope and it's smelling great
I bought that yesterday, yesterday
Had she been gone, I smoke that yesterday
I remember posted on front street selling that ye
I remember that shit like yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday

[Hook]
I'm fucking on these hoes, I'm swagging on these hoes
Let a nigga try me, gat is gonna blow
I'm nuttin' on these hoes, splashing on these hoes
Pull off in that 'rari, dragging on these hoes
You gotta know me though, my gat is on me though
And I'm still off these blunts from yesterday
Shoot a nigga ass for today and yesterday
Yesterday, yesterday
