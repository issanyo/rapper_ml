(Hook)
Hopped on the road and let's go get that money
I pull up hopped out and I'm smokin' on Chronic
Explain this to me boy how ya allergic to money?
Ya can't be allergic to them 50s and 100s
I pull up hopped out and I'm reekin' of weed
I pull the racks out and I'm reekin' them G's
I pull the guap out and I'm singin' them G's
Like Ba-da-ba-ba-ba singin' to the cheese

(Verse)
Boy ya know, pissy wrist pissy throat
My pissy finga, pissy ear get pissy hoes
My palm itchin' plenty guap get plenty o's
Ya think it's sweet them weapons I get plenty those
I want sum' head this nigga bitch she 1-10
I want sum' grands, want sum' millions
Want sum' billions, don't want no friends
Want sum' weed, want sum' killas
I want sum' streets, want sum' houses, want sum' buildings
I pull up flex a nigga like 'Gotta be kiddin' me'
I got the Tec the P11 it got to be with me
Don't be against me boy ya betta be with me
Ya betta call the SWAT and they betta come get me
Bitch I'm rich but I still got that savage in me
I'm high as fuck bitch I got two sevens in me
Point out the fuck nigga think he betta than me
This is an Anarchy, I got that Jax up in me

(Hook)

(Verse 2)
Like biddy-bop-ba-bop singin' to the cheese
Like Sosa Wonder I be with the keys
Call Me Sosa Ray Charles or Sosa R n' B
Told yo bitch come here call me Sosa King
Call me Sosa Subzero I'm the man with the Big Glo
Call me Sosa Liu Kang I'm the man with the kicks on
Call me Sosa Budokai I'm the nigga with the Dragon Ball
Call me Sosa Yu Gi Oh I'm the nigga with the dragon card

(Hook)
