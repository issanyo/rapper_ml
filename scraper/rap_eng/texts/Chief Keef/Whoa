[Verse 1: Capo]
That bitch seen my bankroll, she was like whoooaaa
I know she wanna glo up baby, I ain't talking bout yo clooothes
Girl get the fuck out my face if you ain't tryna gooo
Can't beef with a broke nigga, I'm about my bankrooolls

And when a opp see me, I'ma up that fifty like whoooaaa
Run up on me, get back like whoa
And it's too many of y'all bout two of y'all gettin' poled

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
That bitch hit my dope, that bitch choke
I told that bitch don't fuck, I want throat
But bitch after this top, you gotta go
I just blew some racks at the store
Can't shot at JB's, not no more
Just spent 50 hundred on this blow
Trapping all summer til it snow
All white Forgis on the floor
All white mansion look like coke
Just got a 100 bricks, fresh off the boat
They gone super quick, connect like whoa
And these fuck niggas know I tote
I do a drill while she roll my smoke
This kickback from this nickel, I'm like whoa
I send some shots, I almost hit his throat
That fuck nigga lucky I was off this 4
I come back in the morning, won't miss no more
She seen me in the store, spending rolls
She know I sell coke just by my clothes
I'm smoking three, this shit got me like...
