[Intro]
Otto!
Aye man look God dammit (Let's get it!)
Aye man (Catchup)
You know I'm a, I'm a trend setter (Catchup)
This is what I do you know
Niggas take the shit I do
It could be anything God dammit (Beep, beep)
You know what I'm saying, take what I do
You know what I'm saying, they put it in themselves
And they run with it, God dammit (Sosa)
You know? Ok so look (Bang, bang)
Like a stolen gun you know? (Bang)
When they see the serial number right (Sosa Baby, GBE Baby)
And they come back to a nigga
That be me you know (Bang)

[Hook]
I started in the basement, now I'm in a mansion
I took Ben Franklin, and held him for ransom
I lived with my granny, now I got 10 bedrooms
I rolled in a putt putt, now my car got so much leg room
I turned nothing into something, I am a MacGyver
And the way I do this shit, I am not a tryer
You say you got that wockhardt, I might be your buyer
Nigga think he going crazy, I might be your driver

[Verse 1]
You try shit, I buy shit
Get the blicky, It's lightning
No 30, It's Mike Vic
Thats 52 shots in this hundred
Cause if you fill it up it cannot breath
This cash in my pocket cannot leave
Get seasoned and fall just like leaves
Girl your nigga wanna ball just like me!

My whole fucking body numb, larocaine
I'm a motherfucking boss, you're a lame
How I bowl through these niggas, you're a lane
Knock your neck down your chest, now you're a chain

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I'm going so crazy they should put me in a psych ward
She eat me in my Louie shorts, she bite shorts
The weed make me project, there's science in the weed
Let a nigga try me, he be dying with them trees
You think I'm flying on this glo wood, aladdin
Treat my life like Orlando, Its magic
Play this shit up in the club, Its tragic
You ain't getting money, I can see it, no statics

Up to the top, I climb and climb
No cash for me to see, then I'm going blind
I'm gliding like a GLOverboard, I don't need no wheels
I don't think its purple rain if I don't see the seal

[Hook]

[Outro]
My whole fucking body numb, larocaine
I'm a motherfucking boss, you're a lame
How I ball through these niggas, you're a lame
Knock your neck down your chest, now you're a chain
Bang
