[INTRO]
Man I'm woke off the xans
These niggas sleep off the xans
These niggas can't take xans man
I'm on three xans man, I'm up man, turnt up

[Hook]
I just bought a chain cause I'm glorious
She can get the thing cause she's glorious
Pull up in that thing it look gorgeous
I'm in California plates say Florida
But I'm from Chiraq, It's no order
Coming out here it's like you tryna to cross the border
You better have your weapon and your badge we'll put them
Choppas on yo' ass

[Verse 1]
Stop playin' all them games yo' lil kiddie ass
And just made 10 yo' lil bitty ass
I'm humbla with my choppa I'ma spit it fast
Niggas on that snake shit I don't get it man
Sold my s.i.t it cost 50 man
Check out my watch bitch it's 10 bands
Sit and watch me buy it if I fit it man
How more it's going you just don't get it man
I name my pistol, pistons, Detroit Michigan
Got some thick hoes in Detroit Michigan
And Steady blowing O's bitch
I'm Michelin point at your ass shoot, ain't missing shit

[Hook]
I just bought a chain cause I'm glorious
She can get the thing cause she's glorious
Pull up in that thing it look gorgeous
I'm in California plates say Florida
But I'm from Chiraq, It's no order
Coming out here it's like you trying to cross the border
You better have your weapon and your badge we'll put them
Choppas on yo' ass

[Verse 2]
We going to put them choppas on yo' ass
You goin' need a doctor for yo ass
You goin' need a helicopter for yo' ass
Them choppas spitting real fucking fast
In that car driving, real fucking fast
I almost crashed smoking this fucking dope man
And I got it from my dope man
You smoking on that ass pack, lil nigga
I'm smoking on that gas pack, Lil nigga
And I get cash sack Lil nigga
Racks on racks on racks, racks lil Nigga

[Hook]
I just bought a chain cause I'm glorious
She can get the thing cause she's glorious
Pull up in that thing it look gorgeous
I'm in California plates say Florida
But I'm from Chiraq, It's no order
Coming out here it's like you trying to cross the border
You better have your weapon and your badge we'll put them
Choppas on yo' ass
