[Intro]
Aye
I don't talk that much
I observe niggas, I read niggas
'Cause we...
Moms ain't like you if you was slow and...
She'd beat yo ass if you was slow
[?] mothafucking pillow

[Hook]
Don't let us catch you lacking, catch your ass in traffic
Shit is gon' get hectic, riding with that Mac-10
Woop, there go the police, act like you don't know me
Smoking 'til I OD, bankroll never folding
I done seen some bitches, pulled up then I get them
Tell them bitches get in, if you wanna fit in
Four thousand for this Moncler, I buy 20 a year
Don't give a fuck if the sun come, bitch I'm the sun's son

[Verse 1]
Something like a light pole, riding with my 'Sciples
Them Black Disciples, in case you ain't know
I ain't got no jet yet, finna go and get that
I buy it, I fit it, throws out, I shit it
Riding in the Range Rover, all I do is change clothes
All I do is change hoes, all I do is change bros
I can't have the same bros, niggas act like snake hoes
Bouncing like a kango, but they wanna hang tho

[Hook]
Don't let us catch you lacking, catch your ass in traffic
Shit is gon' get hectic, riding with that Mac-10
Woop, there go the police, act like you don't know me
Smoking 'til I OD, bankroll never folding
I done seen some bitches, pulled up then I get them
Tell them bitches get in, if you wanna fit in
Four thousand for this Moncler, I buy 20 a year
Don't give a fuck if the sun come, bitch I'm the sun's son

[Verse 2]
Riding up Lawrence, see it then I cop it
Pistol, I'ma flop it, fop it, pop it
Riding in a red truck, looking like a damn Blood
Suwu to them damn bloods, cuz to them damn crips
My niggas coming doing hits, don't give no fuck 'bout no camera
When I look in the mirror, I see a rich nigga
Remember when I was broke on Front Street, selling D
And catching felonies, now I get paid to make melodies
Aye, still Dipset
Since 20-O-8
Now it's 2014
Bitch, and I get my own cake
Get my steak and I eat my own plate
I smoke my own blunts
I blow my own gun
I run my whole clique, nigga
And I'm the youngest nigga
I got the mothafucking largest check
I got the fucking finest bitch
Ball got some fine bitches too
Ball got some dime bitches too
Me and Bally Ball riding in Lambo
Lambo like 'ello
Like shawty 'ello
Done it all, bitch, I'm mellow
Pull strings like a chello
I ain't blue bitch I'm yellow
'Bout my green mothafucker, bitch I'm ghetto
You ain't talking green don't call my cello
'Bout green then I push it to the metal
Then I roll me a 'rello
