[Intro: Chief Keef]
All of my bling on
Smoking on the strong
They yayughu ugh  een gone
All of my bling on
My watch on
And my chain on
And my gwap on

[Hook: Chief Keef]
All of my bling on
Smoking on the strong
They like, “Sosa where you been?”
I've been getting money, “you've been gone.”
Come back with my watch on
And my chain on
And my gwap on
Getting my bawss on
They be haten. (x5)
They be haten. (x5)
Hate
Haten. (x4)
Hate
Haten. (x4)

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Well I got money all up in my palms
Bitches all up in my phone
Niggas start to haten, and then stop participatin'
Then gon' get it gon' get it on
Im big from my chain to my arm
Pulled up flexin' on the low
Remember taking dope money back like, “Ay sir I'm Shawn.”
What the fuck you thought?
I had to go get me some gwap
I don’t like no snow
I had to go get me a loan
These niggas come through before
Me, I come through more hard
Something like MIMS
This is why I'm hot

[Bridge: Chief Keef]
Need some M&Millions, I like Chocolate
Peel up with no ceilings on, I think that I'm hot
I think that I'm Wayne, big timers blang blang

[Hook: Chief Keef]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Air force ones, with no socks
Remember having rocks in my socks
Bitch I got my jewelry that I dont even wear but I'm a put it on and get hot
All these fuck niggas jealous, they don’t want me to kill it. They dont give a fuck if I flop!
But I'm a keep on killin', I'm a keep me Millin' I'm a straight go chase that gwap!
Pull up smoking skunk to the skunk
Shawty got some junk in the trunk
And these niggas keep on haten but I dont give a mother fucking fuck to the fuck!
Sneak dissin' like what to the what?
Im like huh to the huh?
I'm just getting money that’s it homie duh duh duh duh duh

[Bridge 2: Chief Keef]
Ayyy 110 in a 55 now running from the cops
She say I got style, baby I get that a lot
I get that a lot
I get that a lot

[Hook: Chief Keef]
