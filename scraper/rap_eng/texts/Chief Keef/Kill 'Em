I'm burning up, I start hella fires

But you think it smell like hella loud

Pull up on yo block, tell my shawties go get 'em
You can't drive my car bitch, go to yo dealer
You can't lay here with me bitch, go to yo nigga
Two pints of lean to sip, two pounds of earth to smoke
Them ain't real diamonds, what you purping for?
Get a M-6, paint it bright like what you purply for?
Officer, what you searching me for?
Got a zip in this Burberry coat
