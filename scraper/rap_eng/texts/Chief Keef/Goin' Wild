[Hook]
Got that 4-5 on my hip, let it rip and I dip
On my kids, niggas sneak dissin' on right here
I don't trust a peer, cops roll in the rear view mirror
I'ma keep going, push it to the limit, getting out of here
I'm in the (?)
Smoking on jet lag, that jet pack all in my ears, it's loud
Shooting them bullets in the crowd
Almighty Chief Sosa goin' wild

[Verse 1]
Hop in my car then steer
I'm work that mothafucka like I'm work the wheel
In the kitchen, whipping up them kids
Bitch, I don't eat nothing but chips
That's cake
Swear to god these niggas fake
They always want some off your plate
Can't get none of my steak
Paid fifty for the Breitling
Look at how that mothafucka shining
The same price for my Glo Man
What you mothafucking do with that Glo then?
Shine
I'm always grinding, with my nine
Tadoe, aye
Walking around with that nina
Doing drills up out of Venoms

[Hook]
4-5 on my hip, let it rip and I dip

I'm in the (?)
Smoking on jet lag, that jet pack all in my ears, it's loud
Shooting them bullets in the crowd
Almighty Chief Sosa goin' wild

[Verse 2]
Goin' crazy
Eighteen with all these babies
Shit crazy
Should of been in the navy
Choppa go gratarra, duh duh duh, save me
Shit crazy, they going crazy
Call 911, tell them save me
Almighty Sosa don't play
Thousands in every room when I wake up
Wake up and get my cake up
Walk on the block then I shake up
Walk in the kitchen, shake up
Put it in the stove, just bake up
Watch it crack up
Tell them fuck niggas lace up
Look at all this mothafucking paper
Running with that mothafucking cheddar
Just wanna spend four thousand on the fucking leather
