[Intro: Wiz Khalifa]
Let me tell you something man
When you see a nigga like me
Look me straight in the eyes
Talk to me man, not at me
And if I pass you some weed
Don't hold that shit for too long
Let everybody get high
It's real nigga's in here

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm a rider
I'm a roller
I'm a gangster
So I'ma roll up
I'm a rider
I'm a roller
I'm a gangster
So I'ma roll up

[Verse 1: Wiz Khalifa]
Just bought a brand new car, backed it straight in
Smokin' on this strong, the pack just came in
I rep my gang hard, it's tattooed in my skin
I'm such a fucking boss, I run with made men
Diamonds in my chain, OG in my paper
Fuck a bottle loss, Fuck about a hater
Fuckin' up the club, fuckin' up this paper
Fuck with GBE, fuckin' with them gangsters
Ridin' it like I ain't never had shit
Gold in my mouth, I'm talking cash shit
Left her with the gang, he need a new bitch
I ain't sweat her, she was comin' at my crew neck

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm a rider
I'm a roller
I'm a gangster
So I'ma roll up
I'm a rider
I'm a roller
I'm a gangster
So I'ma roll up

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I'm a rider, pistol toter
Pistol blower, kush smoker
Bands all in my pocket
Think you goin' take it?  Stop it
My youngins get it poppin'
Now you on the news, they watchin'
Fuckin' with my gang, you goin' end up in violence
Fuckin' with Taylor Gang, you fuckin' with the pilots
Smokin' on this dope, thumbin' through the checks
Thots on my dick like who gonna do me next
I spent so many checks, I coulda bought a jet
GBE 'till I die, I do it for my set
Go Go

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I'm a rider
I'm a roller
I'm a gangster
So I'ma roll up
I'm a rider
I'm a roller
I'm a gangster
So I'ma roll up
