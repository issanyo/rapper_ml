Oh shit this nigga trippin'

[Verse 1: Yae Yae Jordan]
Strapped, so I'm acting like an A hole
Tell Reezy animal I want the same head she gave Tadoe
We reckless, what you wanna play for
Got some shooters with me, yea they shoot when I say so
I'm quick, then that K blow
They hit you then they lay low
Quit thinking shit sweet, you a llittle nigga to me
Lil ass nigga, lil Craig on the streets
Lil ass clothes with them lil jesus piece
Big ass gun cause I got a lil beef
Stealing niggas lives; yea call me a thief
Black ball cap with that bright yellow P
Posted on the block where them goons and killas be
You a killa boy, yeah you really killing me
All these fake ass niggas nowhere near real as me
Being real ain't hard, how hard can it really be

[Bridge: Chief Keef]
Let me get a water

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I'm smoking Tooka, so I'm looking like a asian
You wake up turn yo swag on, I wake up and turn my K on
I'm ruthless, naw baby I ain't babe naw
Niggas want gun play we shooting down the playground
Movie, I say bitch we on that fuu shit
Who this, I say nigga we ain't cool bitch
Me being a professional break in your crib with a tooth pick
No new shit, I just bought a house with a pool shit
Fuu shit, I'm on that "go get your bitch get groovy"
I bruise it, beat that pussy up and abuse it!
Nigga owe me money up his ass goes the pool stick
We do's this, we got movie clips and news clips
Top off the truck fuck all that panoramic roof shit
My mood shit, I just go by what my fucking mood is
Mind steady telling me to kill them then I do it
My gun should've told me something, but I can't acuse it
My mind I lose it that's why I'm always smoking tooka
Your mind I shoot it that's why I always hold my Ruger
Im' off a flat fuck all that leaning with the toolie
I'm out west coolin', out west boolin'
Call Lil' Yae Yae pistols automatic shooting
That chopper make 'em "nae nae" its an automatic movement
My auto started car, with my automatic toolie
Nigga pull up on me it's a automatic shooter, strapped

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Yns Cheeks]
Pussy niggas clear the set, Mac 90's lay em down
Take his head off his neck when them bullets flip around
If the nigga make me sweat. I gotta put em in the ground
All I know is, shoot first and leave the scene on time
Don't let me catch you on this side
I put them beams in your ride
If you ain't ridin for the cause
Then you dont need to be outside
I got a eye for real niggas, bitch I'm livin' like the mob
Never had a money problem and if I did then I rob
At the top its just us nigga 40 on the side
All we do is get loot while you play around
All my niggas gone shoot when its going down
Take your monkey ass off the earth bananas all around
My PA boys, said he was never found
You know I mask up nigga every time I'm bout to clown
I know y'all fed up nigga, cause I'm ballin' all around
Don't get ya head bust nigga, have you leaking on the ground

[Hook]
