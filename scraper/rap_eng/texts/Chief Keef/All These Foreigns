When I pull off in my foreign, that bitch sound like a thunderstorm
All this ice, it got me cold bitch like where my other gun

That bitch came up to my house, meet me at the Doubletree
And I be blowin' (9x)

I got all these foreign bitches but they scared of me
But ain't none in the grave with me

I can't hustle foreign guns, I sell foreign weed
