[Intro]
Sosa baby
GBE baby
Bang Bang
O'Block
Let's get it

[Hook]
I sell, I ship, I bag, I seal
I swag, that Gucci, that Louie, for real
Big knots in my Balmains, it is
The thing under this Louie, it kills
I sell (that dope)
I bag, I seal, I swag (that Gucci)
The Louie, for real, big knots (I got in my)
Balmains, it is the thing (that's up under)
This Louie, it kills, bang

[Verse 1]
So high up off this dope, I need a parachute
I'm in this Bentley coupe, it's filled with residue
I got my dawgs with me and now I let them loose
Tell the cops lies, 'cause I can't tell the truth
I'm rocking Louie sandals, my son got on Louie pampers
So many Gucci sandals, my house smell like Gucci candles
Smoking thoinky oinky, you know I got that thoinky on me
Smoking thoinky oinky, you know I got that thoinky on me

[Hook]
I sell, I ship, I bag, I seal
I swag, that Gucci, that Louie, for real
Big knots in my Balmains, it is
The thing under this Louie, it kills
I sell (that dope)
I bag, I seal, I swag (that Gucci)
The Louie for real, big knots (I got in my)
Balmains, it is the thing (that's up under)
This Louie, it kills, bang

[Verse 2]
I got a half a pound, it's rolled up in a joint
You can't hate me now, I'm in foreign cars
She used to hate me now, now she wanna fuck
It's only one way from down, bitch I'm going up
I got the dope and it's in my Louie backpack
In a sportscar, racing to the racks
Keep on hating on me, you not doing that bad
I'm in this M truck, the plates say fast

[Hook]
I sell, I ship, I bag, I seal
I swag, that Gucci, that Louie, for real
Big knots in my Balmains, it is
The thing under this Louie, it kills
I sell (that dope)
I bag, I seal, I swag (that Gucci)
The Louie, for real, big knots (I got in my)
Balmains, it is the thing (that's up under)
This Louie, it kills, bang
