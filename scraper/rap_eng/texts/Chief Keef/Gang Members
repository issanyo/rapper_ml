The other day a nigga died up in my city (boom boom boom)

[Bridge: Terintino]
Gang members

[Verse 3: Terintino]
Niggas tweaking, I'mma have to up the semi
Smoking Tooka, Truey jeans and some Fendis
I'm in the Audi truck hell no this bitch not rented
I'm steady running red lights, I'mma get a ticket
Tadoe off the molly, steady riding Raris
Bally off the Xannies he gone crash the party
I'm steady rolling Swishers, getting high like Marley
I might just pull up on you, shooting off a Harley
Jusglo just called me, said he need some molly
Cause he got some thotties and they ready to party
Almighty grab the 30, I'mma grab the shottie
Taking big hits like Muhammad Ali
I'm off hella Xannies feeling like a zombie
Alright, aight

[Sample]

[Bridge: Chief Keef]
Aye
Aye man, it's Illinois in the field man
I'm running around where niggas getting killed, man
Niggas talking about I changed
I ain't worried about no little change man
Wen't and bought me a Ruger

[Verse 4: Chief Keef]
Just went and bought me a Ruger
Just to shoot at a nigga medulla
With the crew cuts, and we go too nuts
Pull up, get to shooting at you, and you nigga
Better have your vests and suit nigga, suited and booted
Come in then we screw shit
I'm a screwed up I was raised by a bunch of screwed kids
Remember when I was a school kid
I dropped out, now look who is I is
Wish a nigga would try this
Got the SIG on me and I would blast it
Shoot a nigga in his temple
And go and hit the temple forgiveness
Ask god for forgiveness
Forgive me for all my sins, I'm sinning
