[Hook]
Dope so good, they put they foot in it, they couldn't have
I'm flexing boy wife that bitch, I wouldn't have
Baby say I'm handsome, girl you shouldn't have
Check my pockets, Ben Franklin my other half
Niggas always talking 'bout what they coulda did
Man these niggas always talking 'bout what they shoulda did

[Verse]
And what they would of did and what they could of did
I don't give a fuck you should of did it
I got some niggas in the cut that'll shot you dead
And they gone do you big
They shot you cause you made the wrong move and you knew you did
Niggas say they smoking loud they smoke stupid mids
Man, these niggas always run they mouth like some stupid kids
As she put my dick in her mouth, I leave that lil hoochie scared
Cause I can't trust try to set me up, I'ma shot the stupid bitch

[Hook]
Dope so good, they put they foot in it, they couldn't have
I'm flexing boy wife that bitch, I wouldn't have
Baby say I'm handsome, girl you shouldn't have
Check my pockets, Ben Franklin my other half
Niggas always talking 'bout what they coulda did
Man these niggas always talking 'bout what they shoulda did
