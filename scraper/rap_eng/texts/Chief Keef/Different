[Intro: Ballout]
Yeah
Ballout Baby in this bitch
We in Philly and shit, you know
This some different shit goin' on
ChopsquadDJ on the beat so this a banger

[Chorus]
We pull up in different cars, I pull up to a different mall
I got so many bitches, dawg, I'm havin' paper, I can get you tossed
Water lookin' like some Voss, money fallin' out the vault
We got pistols in this car, Aventador look like it's crossed
I'm always ballin', pass me the dawg
Different spot, a different phone
Different chain, a different charm
Different watches on both arms (I'm so different)
Stay flexed up with different shoes
I pull up in different coupes
At the top is a different view

[Verse 1: Omelly]
Ridin' with the mop and I'm lookin' for the opps
Catch a nigga lackin', I'ma do him on the spot
Got them niggas bitchin' every time I spin a block
Four pound with the lemon squeeze, make it pop
Glock-33, got twenty-three with me
Love for the squad, whole team eat with me
Whole gang strapped, everybody get busy
Left arm froze and my pockets on benji
Pour out a pint, yeah, I'm as high as a kite
Woke up and I fell asleep at the light
Double cups when we pourin' up Sprites
Twin llamas, yeah I keep double pipes

[Chorus]
We pull up in different cars, I pull up to a different mall
I got so many bitches, dawg, I'm havin' paper, I can get you tossed
Water lookin' like some Voss, money fallin' out the vault
We got pistols in this car, Aventador look like it's crossed
I'm always ballin', pass me the dawg
Different spot, a different phone
Different chain, a different charm
Different watches on both arms (I'm so different)
Stay flexed up with different shoes
I pull up in different coupes
At the top is a different view

[Verse 2]
We just pulled up in different 'Cats, ayy
Different TEC's and different MAC's, ayy
She say I'm actin' different, uh
Bet she still gon' fuck again, uh
Bitch, these two different Yeezys
Bitch, this six different, chains
I just bought six different silencers
You better shh when it comes to the gang
Bang bang, this a different Glock
Slide on the opps in a different car
Slide on the opps with a different clock
In the trap with a different pot
Yeah, I get the guap, this a different knot
New J, this a different watch
Hellcat, that's a different lot
Yeah, you work, but you sniff a lot

[Chorus]
We pull up in different cars, I pull up to a different mall
I got so many bitches, dawg, I'm havin' paper, I can get you tossed
Water lookin' like some Voss, money fallin' out the vault
We got pistols in this car, Aventador look like it's crossed
I'm always ballin', pass me the dawg
Different spot, a different phone
Different chain, a different charm
Different watches on both arms (I'm so different)
Stay flexed up with different shoes
I pull up in different coupes
At the top is a different view
