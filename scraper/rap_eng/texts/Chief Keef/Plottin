[Intro]
Niggas plottin' on me
All these niggas plottin' on...
Niggas plottin' on me

[Hook: Chief Keef]
All these niggas plottin' on a nigga
You know I keep a Glock up on a nigga
You know I'll pull my Glock up on a nigga
You know I'll put some shots up on a nigga
You know I'll send my shottas on a nigga
You know I'll send my partners on a nigga
You know I never got my mind up on a nigga
Momma told me don't waste time up on a nigga

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Smoke with tooka pack it hurt my kidneys
Kay Kay called me "Keef" it hurt my feelings
Kay Kay have me cursing (?)
Your bitch want any persons she can finish
She only want the glory, she can't get it
The moral of the story? Keef ain't with it
I'm smokin' on this tooka like forget it
Two tears in a bucket and say forget it
I'm smokin' on the smoke, it be the killest
I take a swisher blunt and then I fill it with my killers
My niggas be the realest
Some niggas snakes and I will not forgive them
Niggas want me to die naked with you
She just want me to cry, she keep kissin'
On my feet, low part, she keep feelin'
She gone pull it out and suck it in a minute
Pistol, I'mma pull it out and bust it in a minute
If you can be a little scout, they touch you if you with it
I'm just sittin' back watchin' niggas sneak dissin'
If you can't stand the heat get out these kitchen
Pistol look good with it, I'mma be tension
If she look good, you know I'mma be in it
Nigga sneak dissin', I don't agree with it
I'mma get a street sweeper and start sweepin' shit

[Verse 2: Fredo Santana]
Coolin' in the trap playin' with my pistols
Niggas sneak dissin' but they bitches
Sosa ordered hit then you know they finished
That's my blood cousin so you know I'm ridin' with him
She only want the glory she can't kick it
Keep a bad bitch face where my dick is
Niggas act all tough they some lil kids
Semi automatics killin' when they kickin'
(?) face wide, she can kick it with it
I only trust myself that's who I'm drillin' with
Need a couple murders (?)
When your dad come? nope, nobody know anything
Niggas all talk, nope not on anything
(?) money talk for a little change
A lot of niggas change for a little change
This 30 shot Glock, I got great aim
Bang-bang
