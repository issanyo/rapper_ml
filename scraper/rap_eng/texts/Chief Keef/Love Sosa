[Spoken Intro: Jordan Gilty]
Fuckers in school telling me, always in the barber shop
“Chief Keef ain’t 'bout this, Chief Keef ain’t 'bout that
My boy a BD on fucking Lamron and them
He, he, they say that nigga don’t be putting in no work”
Shut the fuck up!
Y'all niggas ain’t on shit!
All ya motherfuckers talk about...
“Chief Keef ain’t no hitta, Chief Keef ain’t this, Chief Keef a fake”
Shut the fuck up!
Y'all don’t real with that nigga!
Y'all know that nigga got caught with a ratchet
Shootin' at the police and shit
Nigga been on probation since, fuckin', I don’t know when!
Motherfucka, stop fuckin' playin' him like that
Them niggas savages out there!
If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Chief Keef
I’m fucking beating they ass!
I’m not fucking playing no more!
Know those niggas role with Lil' Reese and them
(Young Chop on the beat)

[Chorus]
These bitches love Sosa
O End or no end
Fucking with them O boys

Hit him with that cobra
