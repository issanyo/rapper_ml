[Hook]
Bad bitch, want my number
I'ma fuck her, If I wanna
I don't wanna, I don't love her
I love the way she suck me up, but I don't trust her
I don't love her, I don't love her
I don't love her, I don't love her
I don't love her, I don't love her
I'mma love her, I don't love her

[Verse]
I smoke loud, smoke that thunder
You smoke that uh-uh, I don't want none
She's a runner, I don't want her
Boy, you love her, you put your trust in her
I be flexin', she be textin'
She wanna pull up, so we could be sexin'
I ain't with it, she can't forget it
She can give me top, I only got a minute
I'ma eagle, nigga fuck your pigeon
I'm like Weezy, nigga fuck your feelings
She call my phone, ring ring, I'm like "what is it?"
She like, "I'm in town and I wanna give you a visit"
