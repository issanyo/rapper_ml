[Intro: Tadoe]
Can you roll the thoinkz for the kid
You know how I'm rockin' when I cut off stockings keep kush in my pockets
You feel, nothing but Thoinkz
Break down that swisher man
Smokin' out the pound I don't want them out the sack

[Hook: Tadoe]
We got Thotties, Thoinkz & Joints
Thotties, Thoinkz & Joints
Disrespect the squad cock it back we gone point
You want beef it's more annoyance, smokin' on this Thoink
Trappin' on the block never lackin' we on point
Shawty ass annoying ask me where I'm going
My life is about foreigns Thotties, Thoinkz & Joints
Shawty ass annoying ask me where I'm goong
My life is about foreigns Thotties, Thoinkz & Joints

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Thotties, Thoinkz & Joints
Thotties, Thoinkz & Joints
Glock FN's and Mac's this ain't what they want
Shells drop like coins, I don't care bout coins
I like fuckin' girls, I don't care bout boys
Ho's be like Chief Sosa cute, like god damn ain't that you
I send my shootas through, and they gone damage you
They got hella 30 shots and they got 50's too
Say I'm broke, gone head tell that lie my chain gone tell the truth
You niggas ain't gettin' no loot
Niggas ain't even worth more than my coupe
How you gone try and pass me nigga and you slower then my coupe
Got niggas with scopes on my roof
You ain't smokin' dope that's how i bool it
Give my niggas the guns and glo and they gone shootin'
I got 50/50 shots, give them to 50 niggas they hit 50 blocks
Like don't come back my way till you kill 50 opps
Member movin' 50 blows and 50 rocks
