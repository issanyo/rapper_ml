[Hook]
I’m 'bout my scrilla, smoking on killer
I say that bitch already know I'm that nigga
I hang with killers, her ass a killer
And she gone wanna go cause I'm that nigga
These tracks I kill 'em, these racks I spend 'em
I make it rain on them cause I'm that nigga
Say I'm that nigga, say I'm that nigga
I make it rain on them cause I that nigga

[Verse 1]
I'm with my killers, smoke with killer
I made it rain on 'em on her cause I'm that nigga
O'Block afila, ain't it nigga
As long I'm on bitch we is them niggas

Put your hands up if you hang with killers
You got that scrilla, you sold vanilla
And never snitched up on one of your niggas
See I'm that nigga, she want that nigga
Catch me on the block with them Normal killers

[Verse 2]
We hit yo' thot, she on my cock
She suck me the next day she suck my block
Cause we on top and we won't stop
Everything I put out be hot like the block
Used to have rocks, in my socks
But now I got over a million bucks
Cause on that stuff, they say yeah it's nothing
I spend a lotta bands, bitch and it's nothing
Ménage à trois, bitch and it's nothing
See she go suck me then here come the other one
Aye Ballout, go get the auto
And toast his little ass like he was Aiki

[Hook]

Say I'm that nigga, say I'm that nigga
I make it rain on them cause I that nigga
