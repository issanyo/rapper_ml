[Chorus]
We don't fuck with new niggas, fuck with new niggas
What you in this shit for show? who the fuck is you nigga?
On that gangbanging shit, this is what I do nigga
So give me room nigga, I act a fool nigga
We be packing tools nigga, dont get screwed nigga
Red beams on the gun and they aimed at you nigga
We be packing tools nigga, dont get screwed nigga
Red beams on the gun and they aimed at you nigga

[Verse 1]
Middle fingers to that reggie, cause all I smoke is loud
Them guns super loud, will shoot a nigga down
We don't fuck with new niggas, so don't get screwed nigga
Yous a motherfucking stain, and we wiping you nigga
You bullet proof, nigga? Then lace your shoes, nigga
We be blowing like a fan, we will let that cool get you
But them bullets hit you hot, show no love for a thot
Or no love for a nigga if that nigga with the ops
So get your top dropped, like a drop top
If you calling the police you gone get a cop dropped
Cause he Pelle Pelle like a fox, ain't talking to the cops
Like a motherfucking thief you can get your ass got

[Chorus]
We don't fuck with new niggas, fuck with new niggas
What you in this shit for show? who the fuck is you nigga?
On that gangbanging shit, this is what I do nigga
So give me room nigga, I act a fool nigga
We be packing tools nigga, dont get screwed nigga
Red beams on the gun and they aimed at you nigga
We be packing tools nigga, dont get screwed nigga
Red beams on the gun and they aimed at you nigga

[Verse 2]
Its a OTF parade, make you dance like Final Phaze
For them fucking new niggas that can't get the time of day
Chief Sosa this and that, bitch what you tryna say
I hit stains I get cake, for a bitch I don't pay
Talking niggas I don't play, is what I'm tryna say
Yous a fucking new nigga, you can't get up in our way
Bullets shoot super far, I'm somewhere with them stars
And this kush that I'm on, just to get it, bitch its hard
Your bitch neck, very far, click clack lets go to war
Got this bitch with my squad then passed her to my dog
Throw some bullets hit him hard, if he talking very hard
My young niggas with the shits, they'll shoot you in your heart

[Chorus]
We don't fuck with new niggas, fuck with new niggas
What you in this shit for show? who the fuck is you nigga?
On that gangbanging shit, this is what I do nigga
So give me room nigga, I act a fool nigga
We be packing tools nigga, dont get screwed nigga
Red beams on the gun and they aimed at you nigga
We be packing tools nigga, dont get screwed nigga
Red beams on the gun and they aimed at you nigga
