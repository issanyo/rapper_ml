[Intro]
Almighty Sosa, Know how I'm rocking
Glo Gang, Glo Gang

[Hook]
Goofy ass nigga tryna kick it wit' no legs (You can't)
If ya outcome ain't income, you thinking wit' no head
Broke Boy I wonder why you ain't getting no bread (Dumb ass)
Told yo' bitch to get on her knees I don't want no sex
Goofy ass niggas sipping cough syrup that ain't no lean (Stop it)
Goofy ass nigga tryna fly without no wings (Stop it)
Goofy ass niggas wish I die up in your dreams bitch
You goofy ass niggas just lie for no reason

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
I'm cooling in the trap, getting high fo' no reason
T roy grab my strap, he gon' blast for no reason
If you knockin' at my trap, betta' knock for a reason
Tray Savage got the Mac, calling shots for the whole four seasons (Bang Bang!)
I got that bitch number I didn't need it
Cause if I text her she gon' wanna call me for no reason (What you want?)
And I don't like talking for no reason (I don't like talking)
I fucked her then made her walk for the four seasons (Dumb thot!)

[Hook/Outro]
