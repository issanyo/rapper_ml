[Intro]
Thank god it's friday
Thank god it's friday
30 on me
Got this 30 on me
Got this 30 on me
Capo!
Damn!
30 on me, don't try me
30 on me, don't
30 on me, don't
30 on me, don't

[Hook: Chief Keef & Ballout]
30 on me, don't try me
Doin' 100 on the highway
Got a bitch blowin' dope, flamed up
Bitch fuck what the cops say
Got bond money on me right now, nigga I ain't gotta wait
For a verse I did want 20, now I want 35K
It's the weekend, wait a minute (2x)
Bought a pound, finna smoke the whole weekend
That mean I'mma be gettin' high the whole weekend
Might bring my V12 out, just for the weekend

[Verse: Ballout]
Doin' a 100 in my V12 cause it's the weekend
Nigga fuck 12, it's the weekend
Smokin' gettin' high, reakin'
Ion't want no lean, that shit have me sleepin' (dreamin')
Shit, I up, it's the weekend
Tryna get fuck up for the weekend
Fallin' off my pill, tweakin'
Let us see a opp, pistol beatin'
Pull up on my block, pullin' 30s out
I got 30 niggas workin' in some dirty houses
Countin' dirty money, watchin' for them dirty mouses
I was movin' dirty bricks, know you heard about it
Drink this dirty cup, I know you worried about me
His bitch called me on the weekend, she must be worried about me
I'm coolin' smoke dope, I ain't worried about it
