[Verse 1: Capo]
Fuck nigga, you ain't with the Glo
Ion't know no G-L-O, that's all I know (Glo gang, glo gang)
Wonder why the fuck these niggas say Capo my pro (Fuck them all)
Bitch you can't hit my weed, here roll yo own
Bang but it really don't bother me (Let me go)
Had to change my number cause this dumb ass bitch keep callin' me (Dumb thot)

If we catch a opp, in the storm, hectic now (Glo gang, glo gang)
