Me [7x]

[Chorus]
I be smokin´ tree
I be spendin´ Gs
Who I see? I
Who do you want to be? Me
Your bitch love me
Wanna fuck me
I ain´t gotta get her high
She wanna drug me

Who be smokin´ dope?
Me, me...
Who be stackin´ dough?
Me, me...
Who be packin´ heat?
Me, me...
Who brought [?]

[Verse 1]
That lil´ ass dope you smokin´ on
That lil´ ass pour you holdin´ on
Wait, where they do that at?
Tell me what is goin´ on
Them lil´ ass racks you holdin´ on
That cheap ass hat you throwin´ on
That lil´ ass drank you pourin´ out
I bring [?] and foreigns out

You son of a bitches got me [?]
(Me)
But sons of Anarchy I´m so commited
(Me)
Broad day, broad wait
I am so damn wicked
(Me)
Treat your bitch like a posted
I gotta stick it
(Me)

Catch a fuck nigga in traffic
Run ´em down
(Me)
Catch his bitch ass
Tie ´em up
Sat ´em down
(Me)
Take his fucking ice
Piece him up
Melt it down
(Me)
Chop his fingers up
To his family
Mail it down
(Me)

[Chorus]
I be smokin´ tree
I be spendin´ Gs
Who I see? I
Who do you want to be? Me
Your bitch love me
Wanna fuck me
I ain´t gotta get her high
She wanna drug me

Who be smokin´ dope?
Me, me...
Who be stackin´ dough?
Me, me...
Who be packin´ heat?
Me, me...
Who brought [?]

[Verse 2]
Pour a 12
In the Sprite
Give it a sun kiss
Muah, muah, muah, muah
Cus´ I love this
With this racks
Bitch I buy it
If I touched it
You can call it a nigga´s bitch
Cus´ I fucked it
I keep necessary unnecessary commas
(Me)
All this light on me like the end of the tunnel
(Me)
And bitch I got the belly of a bagel
(Me)
I´m makin´ cold in the sauna

I keep the 40 in my waist like it´s trash
(Me)
Touch the money, ay
I treat it like a dash
(Me)
Ben Franklin
He treat me like I´m his dad
(Me)
My jewerly water
But I treat it like it´s glass
(Me)

[Chorus]
I be smokin´ tree
I be spendin´ Gs
Who I see? I
Who do you want to be? Me
Your bitch love me
Wanna fuck me
I ain´t gotta get her high
She wanna drug me

Who be smokin´ dope?
Me, me...
Who be stackin´ dough?
Me, me...
Who be packin´ heat?
Me, me...
Who brought [?]
