[Pre-Chorus: Joji]
Fucked up every hour on a week day (week day)
Flexin' on my exes, oh my god (oh my god, oh my god)
I just fucked another freak, aye (freak, aye)
Doin' donuts on the quad (on the quad, on the quad)

[Chorus: Joji]
Geeked up on the motor, got the engine runnin' deep
Poppin' rocks at the bottom of my feet (of my feet, of my feet)
I don't care about the topic if you're talkin' 'bout me
Got another couple racks up for the cheese
Like oh my god (oh my god), I don't know (I don't know)
What the fuck (what the fuck), is goin' on
Like oh my god, yeah, you shouldn't pull up
'Cause we don't give a fuck about love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse: Chief Keef / Instrumental: MYRNE]
Sit and watch me eat up brun'
A vampire, I'm a and-a-one
That check, I want the biggest one
Left and right pocket on Big and Pun
I'm leanin' off my fucking heels (ay)
I just moved to the fuckin' hills (phew)
She don't wanna give me grill (ay)
But she want me to fuck her still (ay)
These niggas just lil' fruit cups
We got 3K's, no Ku Klux
In SoHo in the suite with two sluts
It is 3AM and they are too much
You see the bank roll in my pocket
Talk crazy, I'll blow your ass with a rocket
Took the plug, cause he was out of socket
Gettin' top cause she was out of pocket
When she said that she wasn't

[Pre-Chorus: Joji]
Fucked up every hour on a week day (week day)
Flexin' on my exes, oh my god (oh my god, oh my god)
I just fucked another freak, aye (freak, aye)
Doin' donuts on the quad (on the quad, on the quad)

[Chorus: Joji]
Geeked up on the motor, got the engine runnin' deep
Poppin' rocks at the bottom of my feet (of my feet, of my feet)
I don't care about the topic if you're talkin' 'bout me
Got another couple racks up for the cheese (for the cheese, for the cheese)
Like oh my god (oh my god), I don't know (I don't know)
What the fuck (what the fuck), is goin' on
Like oh my god, yeah, you shouldn't pull up (pull up)
'Cause we don't give a fuck about love, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

[Bridge: Joji / Instrumental Drop: MYRNE]
Like oh my god
'Cause we don't give a fuck about love, yeah, yeah, yeah
Like oh my god
What the fuck
