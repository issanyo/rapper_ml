[Hook]
Ay, I pull up stuntin’
I was trying to get some money
I came through with the onion
They say that shit smellin’ funky
The cops pulled over me
They say they ass smellin weed
Cuz I be smoking on the tookah
And you be smoking on the fookah

[Verse 1]
I’ve been smokin’ on the dope
Made my lungs black, oh well
You better stand where you at
Don’t try me, pussy don’t go there
You better watch your hoe
Cause’ she give me top so well
All the keke’s call my phone
They hit me like I got a [???]
I’m ringin’ like I got a doorbell
All my [?] give em more hell
Hop out the whip, it feel like a [?]
He squeeze, he can't breathe, give him more L
Imma wait outside his house and build a fort there
Midnight, ring his bell, give him more mail
Gotta lot of beef, talk of me, more shells
You know my cash longer than your whore hair

[Hook]
Ay, I pull up stuntin’
I was trying to get some money
I came through with the onion
They say that shit smellin’ funky
The cops pulled over me
They say they ass smellin weed
Cuz I be smoking on the tookah
And you be smoking on the fookah

[Verse 2]
The cops pulled me over and i [?] on it
He say he smoke tookah, he got nerve on him
[?]
He think he hard cuz he got shot but we gon put another burn on him
Bitch thinks she's bad, gotta curse on him
I be fresh til death, I grab the hearse for him
Stop hatin, sit back and you can learn somethin
Bitch I'm Cyclops, I'm always tryna burn somethin
I knew you knew she money in, you can get some
Walk me down to the ground, like i spill some
Enough about you, here your bitch come
I was doin nothin and she suck me off like I did somethin
I don't talk about muscles when I say I got big guns
You think you real, but your ass really fiction
You niggas really pussy, Imma get you all some tampons
You want a autograph, I need something to put my step on

[Hook]
Ay, I pull up stuntin’
I was trying to get some money

They say that shit smellin’ funky
The cops pulled over me
