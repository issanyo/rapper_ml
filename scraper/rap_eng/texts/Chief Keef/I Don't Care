[Intro]
We smoke dope here, tote poles here, fuck hoes
Sosa baby, what we do?
Almighty, huh
Glo Gang
What we do?
Almighty

[Hook]
We smoke dope here, tote poles here, fuck hoes here
Wanna glo up? Don't glo there, just glo here
You know us, we rolling, we gloing
These .30's on us, we up them, we blowing
And that's why I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And that's why I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And that's why I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And that's why I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And that's why I don't care

[Verse]
Nigga you ain't gloing, boy you don't belong here
My bitch holding my .30 and it's long like her long hair
Tadoe po'd up an 8, I'm like "boy why you pour that?"
Now you finna have me tweaking, leaning and falling over
Hold on, damn
I'm with all my soldiers
I'll make sure all them gloing
And I buy all them .40s
Now all I'm blowing

[Hook]
Tote poles here, fuck hoes here
Wanna glo up? Don't glo there, just glo here
You know us, we rolling, we gloing
These .30's on us, we up them, we blowing
And that's why I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And that's why I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And that's why I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And that's why I don't care, I don't care, I don't care
And that's why I don't care
