" Leave everything else alone man, only thing you need to be doin' or worried bout or tryna get high wit is marijuana. If it ain't dat den YOU TRIPPIN man!  But other then that man, like I said man me and holiday we been doing this shit since motherfuckin'...2 years, its been 2 years 3 years now you know what im saying na mean im still rockin wit him you know he gang. Gang shit, you know, and what makes it so special is that shiit... Im different, he different. You can't say we are the same as him or say we are the same as them, you know what im saying? Cause I got people copying me and im sure holiday got the same type shit. Motherfucka's biting styles biting. You know what im saying, biting hands, biting biting arms, you know what im saying biting, just biting and motherfuckers just biting but ya know. I dont bite, this what I do, if im inlfuenced by a person, like if im influenced by Weezy. If I'm influenced Wop, if im influenced by Roc, if im influenced by Jeezy. You know what im saying? If i'm influenced 50 if im influenced by those type of people. My music that I make will be ' influenced by ' but it will always be Chief Sosa being himself at the same time you know what im sayin' ?
