Bitch I'm Chief Sosa, if yo man ain't acting right
Tell all your friends about it, homie, after bragging rights
I know we just met but is you gon' let me smash tonight
I was just playing but is you gon' give me head tonight
You might get a chance, girl, to live your life and rock my ice
You can have all of me, everything, just not my life
You can smoke all my weed, everything, just don't do white
Do me a favor, don't do pints, and you can do what you like
