[Intro]
Thank you, thank you
Thank you, thank you

[Hook - Chief Keef]
Thank you, thank you
I woke up this morning, told the lord thank you
Try almighty Sosa, watch my niggas break you
And we are totin, boy don’t make us spray you
You gon’ need Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
I don’t trust you boy, and I don’t like you
I was smoking bud done glo with my troops
For these 30s in my Glock I told the lord thank you

[Verse 1 - Lil Flash]
Thank you, thank you, thank you
Used to thank you but I did not pay for you
Better pray to Jesus Jesus ‘fore we spray you
But saying thank you is something I can’t do
Woke up this morning blessed, look up to God like thank you
Be like thank you to your haters
There’s a reason they hate you
They made you, they want to copy paste you
They sneak dissing on you ‘cause they can’t do what they do
I’mma let the heat just bake you
Better jump your ass right behind that table
Glo Gang, we’ll pull up on you and watch you drain you
Treat a pussy like Windex, pull it out then I spray you
Art gang, we pull up, paint you

[Hook - Chief Keef]
Thank you, thank you
I woke up this morning, told the lord thank you
Try almighty Sosa, watch my niggas break you
And we come talking, boy don’t make us spray you
You gon’ need Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
I don’t trust you boy, and I don’t like you
I was smoking bud done glo with my troops
For these 30s in my Glock I told the lord thank you
