Put ya sets up, Put ya gats up

Walk up in the store with my check up
Walk up in that office where my check at
Or I’m a blow this bitch, on my exploding shit

They like please calm down Sosa but I won’t for shit
Blow my gun at anyone on my 3hunnid shit

I’m a catch a mother fucker every night and every morning
She seen my ice she think it’s snowin'
You try to take my ice bitch thank the morning
Is you gone wake up to thank the lord?
Glo up like wake up you can’t avoid
If you don’t smell the coffee we come through chalkin'
Have this pistol on me come through sparkin'
I have my dogs with me come through barkin'
You ain’t have no fucking business talking

My dogs pitbulls they talk with Glocks and forties
The cops grab me ain’t talkin' without my lawyer
