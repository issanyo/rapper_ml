[Hook: Chief Keef]
I'ma smoke ya smoke ya smoke ya
Kush I'm smoking smoking smoking
Big ass 4-0 I am toting
Don't make me put this bitch in motion
I'm off a flat I don't know where my car went
I named my nina Gina just like Martin
My blunts look like Peter, swear it got rolls in it
She ask me why my pants sagging cause bank rolls in it

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Wait, hold up
I'm smoking on a big blunt of Carlton
Trying to figure where my car went
I think I parked it up that mountain
I don't know, I was off Xanax
I don't know, bitch I was off ten flats, aye
I don't know how, I was off them ten blunts, aye
I don't know I was high as a fuck, aye
They know ion't give no fuck ,aye
Come through catch yo bitch ass light you up, can't throw up
Tell yo mans to get up, aye
50 knock him down he can't get up, aye
Smoking Tooka Tooka Tooka
I'm smoking Tutu like a hooka
I'm smoking Tutu like a blue one
A BLU cigarette, alright now
You gone meet my two drums

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Flexing on them
Baby girl I'm counting checks up on them
I got these bitches wet up on them
Niggas can't even get seconds from them
And I don't even pay them though
But my shit playing on the radio
That's if I want it to
You know ion't give a fuck or two though
I ain't got no Hublot
Got a Breitling with bout 82 stones
I got a chain with bout 84 stones
And I'm only 18 what you on
I'm off this Xanax right now
Need a fucking flat right now
I'm smoking on this blunt right now
Still screaming fuck rehab right now
