[Intro]
Almighty So

[Hook]
Hell shit, bitch I'm hot as hell shit
My niggas in the field toting steel bitch, get killed quick
Now I'm rich as fuck, remember I used to steal shit
Now I go crazy, kill shit
Now I buy the bigger shit, can't get the lil shit
I'm tired of all these hoes sway me over lil shit
I'm tired of getting money, naw real shit
Bitch I'm from O'Block, I don't feel shit

[Verse 1]
You smoke mild, tryna smoke what I smoke, it's the killswitch
An opp in my lane, all I know is to kill bitch
This bitch on Twitter subtweeting but you all in my heels bitch
Just got a house in Beverly, call it my hills bitch
I'm high off that earth, I'm on that Shondale shit
These niggas claim Insane, just don't got killed bitch
Get your ass smoked, screaming out "die L's" bitch
And I ain't gotta do shit, nigga I melt shit
Spent 15 thousand in Pearl Harbor and that was a lil bit
You niggas ain't even got more money than my lil bitch
You spook up whenever you see me, y'all some lil bitches
Y'all ain't ever real niggas, y'all some lil wieners
I got indicted when I was getting money but nigga I'm still getting it
I'm Almighty nigga, I can sign you if you worth that mill ticket

[Hook]
Hell shit, bitch I'm hot as hell shit
My niggas in the field toting steel bitch, get killed quick
Now I'm rich as fuck, remember I used to steal shit
Now I go crazy, kill shit
Now I buy the bigger shit, can't get the lil shit
I'm tired of all these hoes sway me over lil shit
I'm tired of getting money, naw real shit
Bitch I'm from O'Block, I don't feel shit
