[Intro: Chief Keef]
Aye, aye, aye, aye
Bang Bang Bang!
Doh, doh doh doh
Skert, skert, skert
(DP on the beat)
Hundred for the one's and two hundred for my...

[Hook: Chief Keef]
I paid hundred for the ones
And two hundred for my gun
Paid a hundred for the drum
Just to go up in my gun
Paid fifty for some bullets
That's a box of bullets
Shoot 'em at your stomach
And shoot at your medulla
With my ruger
Smoking Tooka
In my beamer
I'm a fooler
Pull up on ya
Pull up to ya
Switch cars
Did I fool ya?

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Pull up in that 'Rari, hallelujah
Then I hop up in my Beemer just to fool ya
Fool your bitch, I pull up in that fucking Hummer
Hummer H2 bitch, nah this ain't no scooter
It go faster than a Harley
Someone please pass me the damn Marley
Even though I don't smoke with nobody
I don't need no bodyguard I got my body
Got my Tommy
Shoot this shit right up at your tummy
Now you're looking like a zombie
Trying to get help but you couldn't find it
My Beemer colored soo woo ravioli
'Member when I used to eat ravioli?
Now I can buy Kay Kay a little pony
Anything she want, you know I'm on it
That money I be on it
I ain't got no business sitting on it
I just got some business with getting money
You ain't talking money, that shit funny

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
So we're coolin' in my mansion
Holding your bitch for ransom
How much you got to get her back fam
She ain't worth shit so I hope you got a bounty
Boy I heard your belt Versace
I got 50 times Versace in my pocket
Money be my logic
So you know I'm all about it
