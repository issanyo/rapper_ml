[Intro]
Aye, pass me a whatchamacallit
Told that bitch whatchamacalla
She ask a nigga whatchamacall that shit

[Hook]
Load 'em, let 'em, hold 'em
Smoking, poured up
Fry ‘em, he holdin’
I'm gloing, you know it
I'm blowing a four fifth
Got 18 shots in it
That fuckboy can hold 'em
I'll get some more and I'll do it over
I fucked ya hoe, I'm sorry didn't know that you want her
His bitch a whatchamacalla
My watch how muchamacalla
She don't like Chief Sosa cause he pulled up in that whatchamacalla

[Verse]
My plug just came through with the lean
It got me moving all slow, doing retarded things
50 thousand dollars up in my Robin jeans
Let a nigga try to take it, smoke his ass like I am barbecuing
I got my chopper with me
So that's like a hundred shots with me
Got a fat ass Glock for this fat ass guap like I got Chop with me
I ain't never going broke I'm so used to winnin' bitch, no lottery
Steady say you getting money but you ain't, making my head hurt, stop it please
I see 1's and 5's, I see a lot of things
Can't wife that thot, wanna know what my momma think
'Cause of that karma thing, I got my gun with me
We come through and we send shots at your tip top with this big Glock
Knock that nigga head off, he tried to take my wrist watch
Hoes call me Big Papa, all eyes on me, call me Lil Pac
Boy you got that old ass car, that ain't no damn push start

[Hook]
Load 'em, let 'em, hold 'em
Smoking, poured up
Fry ‘em, he holdin’
I'm gloing, you know it
I'm blowing a four fifth
Got 18 shots in it
That fuckboy can hold 'em
I'll get some more and I'll do it over
I fucked ya hoe, I'm sorry didn't know that you want her
His bitch a whatchamacalla
My watch how muchamacalla
She don't like Chief Sosa cause he pulled up in that whatchamacalla
