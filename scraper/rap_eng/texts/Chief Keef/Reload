[Intro: Ballout]
Ooooooh, what the fuck?
This bitch made my spill my muhfucking cup!

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Take it out, stuff it
Half ounce, fuck it
This track bitch, you love it
Already fucking
That ain't straight drop, that's Tussin
That fake ice, tuck it
'Cause this bling on me bussing
Believe that, trust it

[Verse 2: Tadoe]
Balling real hard, I ain't hooping nigga
Fall in love bitch, I ain't Cupid nigga
I get money, get stupid figures
Got your gun but you ain't shooting nigga
Hit a nigga pockets like a goofy, nigga
Blue Robbin's jeans with the Ruger, nigga
Just copped a Porsche, real coupes nigga
Hit a few blocks acting foolish nigga
Smoking on the dope, got a toolie with us
Smoking on the thoinks, got a cutie with us
All my niggas solid, no fruity niggas
And I'm getting guap, still shooting niggas
Shawty bounce her ass like I'm Juvie nigga
Shawty bounce her ass like I'm Juvie nigga
In this bitch, we gon' make a movie nigga
In this bitch, we gon' make a movie nigga

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Niggas steady talking that tough shit
Me and gang be on that fuck shit
This car I'm whipping be on that rough shit
Kentucky Derby, we on that dust shit
You want something nigga, meet me at the function
Don't make your bitch meet me at the dungeon
All this muhfucking designer on me
Fuck around, thought I was up in London
Drive the car like it's muhfucking stuntman
Shoot the ball like I'm muhfucking Kobe
Shoot the pistol like I'm muhfucking Odee
Ice on me, got me colder than a polar
And the dope got me higher than a solar
In that thang, switching lanes like a bowler
Crack the window then tropical aroma
Imma smack the Barts skatin, call me Homer

[Verse 4: Ballout]
Top of the world, in my penthouse
Just fucked yo bitch, kicked yo bitch out
Just took me a quick shower
It ain't even been an hour
Counting this money up
Know I had to run it up
Hopped out to get some cups
Hellcat, still running bruh

[Verse 5: Tadoe]
Hellcat, we just copped new Jeeps
Rims sitting higher than a dually
Trap spot got like two or three
Hit my phone if you need a few P's
In the strip club serving QP's
New jeans cost me 'bout two keys
Keep the ranch sauce, smoke the blue cheese
Keep the ranch sauce, smoke the blue cheese

[Verse 6: Chief Keef]
If I rob the bank I take the Nemos
If I hit yo block I take the venom
Bitch you know I got the more than nice meatrolls
I got more tools than Home Depot
Hit yo block going crazy, call me Cee-Lo
Seagull what I name Desert Eagle
I'ma decock when I reload
Wrist looking zero below
Rolling 'round this bitch in a pea coat
Having me some steak on pico
Shells catch a nigga like Chico
Folks knock 'em out like Deebo
Pockets on full like tito
Looking bossed up, might catch the R.I.C.O
Green on me, young eco
First twenty hit ya, now I gotta reload
(Let's get it, bang bang bang)
Hit the back if you need dope smoke
Sending shawty that's only 16
Sell ya what you want with the 44
Stop, do not try to run off
Tell him go, he gon' let the gun off
And this shit, real clear like Smirnoff
On the phone with the plug talking bird talk
