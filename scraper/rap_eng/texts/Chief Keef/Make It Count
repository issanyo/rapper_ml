[Chorus]
Niggas ain't on piss, niggas ain't on shit
I just bought a 40 cause there ain't no kick
Got a 30 in it I'ma make it spit
I'm gon' make it count, bitch I'm spraying shit
I'ma count this money while I take a shit
I'ma spray that dummy if he try to take my shit
A situation is what all you make of it
Well I'ma make these pistols get to saying shit

[Verse 1]
I got old guns on that cranky shit
I got new guns can't wait to spray that shit
I swear my Mac be on some player shit
But don't make them get to spraying shit
Smoking Tooka like a hookah
Run up on me I'ma shoot ya
No Versace Medusa
1400 for this belt like booyah
Diamonds on my neck like tumors
Hurting my damn neck like ooh ah
Ben Franklin in my pocket
Try to take it put your ass on the front of New York Times
Can't see me boy cause you are, blind
You say you getting money
You are, lying
Got a car 'round my neck now who wanna, drive

[Chorus]
Niggas ain't on piss, niggas ain't on shit
I just bought a 40 cause there ain't no kick
Got a 30 in it I'ma make it spit
I'm gon' make it count, bitch I'm spraying shit
I'ma count this money while I take a shit
I'ma spray that dummy if he try to take my shit
A situation is what all you make of it
Well I'ma make these pistols get to saying shit

[Verse 2]
Posted up on frontstreet
Selling dope up out my grandma house
No I can't have no company
Unless you tryna sell dope up out it
Ain't no security with me
It's just me and 40 and Johnson
And I can't trust niggas
So I went and bought me a fucking golden choppa
That bitch got tourettes
She be screaming out shit like "shit"
Bitch, fuck niggas
We don't fuck with fuck niggas
Coming out the cut, when you see us, duck nigga
Coming strong nigga
Smoking on that fucking strong nigga
Bitch I got my arm nigga
Armed gun and my own alarm nigga
I'm my own man I'm standing strong nigga
Try me you won't be going home nigga
Kushy Kushy, my cologne nigga
Walk to court they like "you smell like strong nigga"
Glo Gang shit that's what I'm on nigga
You a opposite you meet my horn nigga
We don't mean peace we mean war nigga
Shoot your ass, you and your boys nigga
And I still believe in god nigga
But I don't believe in frauds nigga
I'm a Glo Man so why would I shiver
Up this 4-5 get to porcupine them niggas
