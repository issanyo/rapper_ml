[Intro: Suav Corleone]
Corleone y'all mane
Everything go thiyow
If you ain't know you know by now don't you

[Chorus: Suav Corleone]
Thiyow (thiyow), thiyow (thiyow)
Thiyow (thiyow), thiyow (thiyow)
In the trap serving that thiyow
Run up and I'm up in that thiyow
Hit a nigga bitch like thiyow
Young nigga getting rich like thiyow (thiyow)

[Verse 1: Suav Corleone]
Everything thiyow, everything thiyow
Everything thiyow,  plus I fuck your bitch like thiyow
Neck and wrist, my shit so glist can't you fucking see
Pull up on that 7 mile and I'm serving all that best weed
Baby that's that thiyow
Dope, that's that thiyow
Your bitch head, that thiyow
I get it all like thiyow
Drop her off like bye bye
Picking up that pie pie
Stirring up that chicken noodle, the junkies want that pie pie
Shoot an opp like bye bye
Right between his eye eye
Take a puff of that thiyow, got me feeling  just like popeye
Your bitch give me that good pussy, I save her number as thiyow
I'm in the trap in that black hoodie and I'm gripping on that thiyow (Thiyow)

[Chorus: Suav Corleone]
Thiyow (thiyow), thiyow (thiyow)
Thiyow (thiyow), thiyow (thiyow)
In the trap serving that thiyow
Run up and I'm up in that thiyow
Hit a nigga bitch like thiyow
Young nigga getting rich like thiyow (thiyow)
Thiyow (thiyow), thiyow (thiyow)
Thiyow (thiyow), thiyow (thiyow)
In the trap serving that thiyow
Run up and I'm up in that thiyow
Hit a nigga bitch like thiyow
Young nigga getting rich like thiyow (thiyow)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I'm smoking Pacquiao (Smoking that dope)
I brought the Maccy out (I brought the bang)
I brought the fifty out (I brought the fifty shots)
There ain't no backing down (There ain't no, aye)
I'm sipping hella drink (Sipping drink)
I'm smoking hella thrax (Smoking dank)
I smoke that underarm (I smoke that ugh)
You smoke that jello pack (You smoke that aye)
Pick your bitch up like thiyow (Thiyow)
I'm only gonna have her for a while
She say she wanna spend the night out? (Spend the night out nigga)
Her nigga act tough, then it's lights out (It's lights out bih)
Cops grab me and read my rights out (Rights out)
I call my lawyer up, then I'm right out (Right out)
Tooka hitting hard like thiyow, thiyow
Shit got me blanking like whiteout (Whiteout)
A nigga say he's serving that thiyow (That what?)
I brought a lot of racks for the buyout
Rolling off the flat, I'm high as fuck, I didn't even know I had the pipe out (I didn't)
Them niggas need some milk (Some milk)
Cause we're hitting their Honeycomb hideout (Skrrt, skrrt)
Pull up, click clack, piyow (Skrrt, bang)
Shoot night time or light out (Bang)

[Chorus: Suav Corleone]
Thiyow (thiyow), thiyow (thiyow)
Thiyow (thiyow), thiyow (thiyow)
In the trap serving that thiyow
Run up and I'm up in that thiyow
Hit a nigga bitch like thiyow
Young nigga getting rich like thiyow (thiyow)
Thiyow (thiyow), thiyow (thiyow)

In the trap serving that thiyow
Run up and I'm up in that thiyow
Hit a nigga bitch like thiyow
Young nigga getting rich like thiyow (thiyow)
