[Hook]
She say she choose me cause she like my jewelry
And I come through choppin' shit like young black Bruce Lee
I'm smoking gooey, got clips like the movies
Smoke a motherfucker just for suing me
She say she choose me, she say she choose me
Say she love me, don't ever wanna lose me
She love my white t, my cars and that I'm icy
Black Bruce Lee, my jewelry love fighting

[Verse 1]
'Member ridin hoopties, now I can coupies
Lived with grandma, now my house big enough to lose me
She wanna give me coochi cause my life so gucci
And I pull up choppin' shit like young Bruce Lee
Walk in them stores, I don't give no fuck I'ma cash out
Choppers in here, we gon blast out
I'm off that Tooka, June Bug, Aiki, and Fat Head now
You can see what I got and what I had now
I got that guap
Sosa I like your car
Tell them other niggas catch up to Glo, they fire
Try me he gon' get shot
Never tell Almighty what he not
And Ben Franklin my dude
Niggas with me for Ben Frank they might shoot
Sike ass niggas ain't no tellin what they might do
Chiraq ass niggas start a war upon my jewels

[Hook]
She say she choose me cause she like my jewelry

Smoke a motherfucker just for suing me
She say she choose me, she say she choose me
Say she love me, don't ever wanna lose me
She love my white t, my cars and that I'm icy
Black Bruce Lee, my jewelry love fighting
