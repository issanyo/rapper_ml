[Hook]
I just spent a lot of money, now I'm tired
'member when I use to fantasize
Got this nina wit me, you know she gon' ride
Blow a nigga down, do or die
You scared to go to church bitch, Kumbaya
Them pistols get to bussing, Boo-ya-ya
You ain't with the Glo Gang nigga, who are ya?
Steady texting my phone, this just bitch just blew my high

[Verse]
This bitch just blew my high
And I was high off all of these drugs
I walk in the mall and buy out all of these stores
Nigga came out with two bags he thought he was
I was off that dope and I was high of all this lean
Let a nigga try me, I got my Glock forty
It got thirty shots in it, it gon' make em scream
(SCREAM!)
Hey Sosa, why you so high?
I gotta get high, to balance my low
I'm moving too fast, I gotta pour a four
Spend lots of cash, 'member used to be broke
Sosa, what you got a gun for?
Cause I'ma shoot when I see my opponent
Shoot late ass nights and early ass mornings
But hold up I gotta roll me a Dutch

[Hook]
I just spent a lot of money, now I'm tired
'member when I use to fantasize
Got this nina wit me, you know she gon' ride
Blow a nigga down, do or die
You scared to go to church bitch, Kumbaya
Them pistols get to bussing, Boo-ya-ya
You ain't with the Glo Gang nigga, who are ya?
Steady texting my phone, this just bitch just blew my high
