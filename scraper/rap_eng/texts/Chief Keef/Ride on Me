Bitch, this Gucci shirt cost 1500
Bitch, this Hermes cost 1600
Fifteen pairs of 1's cost 1500
I need a quarter pound, cost 1500
I need a zip, bitch, that's 200
Nigga tried to charge me 500
He think I give a fuck cuz I got money
Ain't no nigga gone tryna ride on me

[Verse 1]
Nigga slide on me
They gone bring yo guys on me
Bring yo .40 wit you
Nigga, bring your shawtys with you
Just do it, Nike
Nigga, you don't like me
Nigga, I don't know you
You got your hand out, I don't owe you
Pistols up, pistols blow you
We got them pistols tucked but we will show you
What the fuck we gone do?
Have them fucking pistols fucking on you
350 in the coupe
Nigga, who the fuck is you?
200 in the truck
Running niggas over, running thots up in the truck

[Verse 2]
Ball, Ride a 5180 on the dash
He was driving fast
Thought he was gone crash
It's a Super Charger
I bought a Hemi on that ass
He drinking gold bottles, I bought Remy on they ass
Straight block shit
Pull up, get shot quick
We pulled off quick
Why, bitch? Cuz we seen a dick
This that straight drop shit
Straight out the pot shit
Turn a 100 into a brick
Turn a 60 into a lick
Turn a 50 pack into a fit
Turn a 500 pack into my wrist
Yeah I'm shining, bitch
I turned some money into diamonds, bitch
