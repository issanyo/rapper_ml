[Intro x3]
Make you viral
Make you viral
Make you viral

[Chorus]
Hello world, how you?
If you got a price we could buy you
Don't fuck wit' your boss, I'll fire you
You say you wanna travel, I'll fly you
Coolin' with my dogs, come and find you
You can call me rich but I ain't Lionel
I told her when the cops come give a signal
'Wop in the cut, he make you viral
Make you viral

[Verse 1]
These hoes be tryna kick it, no taekwondo
Yellow bitch wit' me look albino
Nigga go long, we throwin' spirals
Chief Sosa a psychic slash psycho
What's on my mental there is no tomorrow
I think I see a light at end of tunnel
I swear these hoes be suckin' me like it's normal
Got flavored lube for you lil bitch and it taste like carmel
I'm the king of the jungle
No WWE, but let's get ready to rumble, ayy
Fuck a lil bitch so good she wanna cuddle
She thought I got time I had to bust a lil bitch bubble
I'm dancin' wit' a lil bitch like Usher
And if ya fuck wit' me then ya know it's fuck ya
Hop on a plane for a bitch can't think I'm gonna rush ya
The watches I wear ain't ever on fakewatchbusta
Make you viral

[Chorus]
Hello world, how you
If you got a price we could buy you
Don't fuck wit' your boss, I'll fire you
You say you wanna travel, I'll fly you
Coolin' with my dogs, come and find you
You can call me rich but I ain't Lionel
I told her when the cops come give a signal
'Wop in the cut, he make you viral
Make you viral

[Verse 2]
Can you hear me
Bitch we ride 'round Philly totin' them frisbees
Just bumped into a bad bitch and her name Mackenzie
In the SRT wit' my watch, it cost a Bentley
[?]
And my pockets ten times [?]
Came in so fuckin' fast like a thunderbolt
Hey lil big nigga pass me the [?]
Hey nigga you gotta spend them racks and get it back
And I hate Chief Sosa, I'mma kill his ass
Three point shot wit' the Glock, Tadoe wit' the pass
Feel like Rocko got the gift of gab
Never had a lil bitch off Instagram like ugh-ugh
Done rolled too much have to take a breath like huh-huh
Put that silencer on the rifle, buck-buck
On her toes, if you feel froggy then jump-jump
Hit and serve you can call me first come
First couple mils long, went and bought forty guns
And that's facts
I ain't talkin' drank when I say I give bitches the Act
I'm prolly somewhere nice in the back of the back
I ain't have no hobby in school, no ball no track
Bitch wanna talk a lil bit but I'm callin' back
Hang up on her then text my phone back
Make you viral

[Chorus]
Hello world, how you
If you got a price we could buy you
Don't fuck wit' your boss, I'll fire you
You say you wanna travel, I'll fly you
Coolin' with my dogs, come and find you
You can call me rich but I ain't Lionel
I told her when the cops come give a signal
'Wop in the cut, he make you viral
Make you viral
