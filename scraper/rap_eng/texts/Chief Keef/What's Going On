[Hook]
I'm smoking strong out the pound
Riding 'round, my niggas they down
Baby take a look around, these niggas clowns
When I pull up, they know Chief So in the house
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?

[Verse 1]
Im so cocky, won't smoke Keisha with your people
I'm so stingy won't share Keisha with your Keisha
These bitches thotties, they be eating, out here eating
These niggas bitches, they be tweaking, out here tweaking
These niggas haten on, but treat 'em, I'ma treat 'em
If these bitches faking, I'm gone leave 'em, I'm gone leave 'em
Smoking on this dope, try and match me I don't need it
Niggas say they Glo, I'm tryna see how I don't see it
These bitches say I'ma dog, well if I was you then I wouldn't keep it
She say she see me balling, well if I was you then I wouldn't leave me
See you calling my phone, but I act like I turned off the ringer
Got his bitch number then I texted that bitch off Pinger

[Hook]
I'm smoking strong out the pound
Riding 'round, my niggas they down
Baby take a look around, these niggas clowns
When I pull up, they know Chief So in the house
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?

[Verse 2]
Hello?
What's going on?
What you want?
Is you talking dough? No
Fuck you calling my phone?
If you talking dope nigga, we can get it on
I ate all of it 'til the shit was gone
Chief Sosa love flexing like I feel it in my bones
Gave the bitch a D, made her feel it in the O
Came through swagging, you can feel it through the door
Got a fat ass hammer, you can feel it through my coat
Don't leave a little biddy bitch with Chief So
I'ma leave that bitch in the middle of nowhere
Smoking on this '93 dope, but that kush rolled up on cause she got long hair
Fuck I look like? Nemo? You ain't gotta find me bitch, I Glo here
Fucking bitches, counting money, having fun, you don't belong here
Smoking Backwoods, not no bong here
You smoking mid, well bitch I brought that strong here

[Hook]
I'm smoking strong out the pound
Riding 'round, my niggas they down
Baby take a look around, these niggas clowns
When I pull up, they know Chief So in the house
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?
What's going on? What's going on?
