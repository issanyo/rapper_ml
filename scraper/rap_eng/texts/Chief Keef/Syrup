[Hook: Lil Flip] (x5)
Rainbow colors in my cup
Jolly Ranchers man, that shit be good as fuck
That's that syrup muthafucka, that's that syrup
That's that syrup muthafucka, that's that syrup
I'm throwed-throwed-throwed

[Verse: Chief Keef]
Po' up some lean, now I'm leaning, geeking
Pop a flat, now I'm in it tweaking, niggas tweaking
This lean got these bitches tweaking, now they sleeping
Can't sleep on me, can't sleep with me, bitch, now they leaving
I just bought ten PTs and now they finished
This lil thot ain't wanna freak me, now she freezing
Niggas be like "Sosa called Johnny Dang up, now he freezing"
Rest in peace DJ Screw, and bitch I'm Pimp C tho
I was off some Xanax and leaning, came doing hits on a T-top
Mac 99 and nina, beat in your face like a beatbox
But since you mustard you can't catch up, fuck nigga then just keep up
Walked in the club just T'd up, like "fuck nigga where the reefer?"
Steady uploading on Tgram, then fuck nigga wanna lean now
Just bought ten PTs again, fuck nigga I need to pee now
Now I'm finna po' this lean, pineapple catching shit like a rebound
Purple in my cup, green Jolly Ranch, get some Barney now
