[Intro: T.I.]
Hustle gang patna
Let me talk these niggas one time Chief
Leggo, GDOD
I'll tell my A-Town, Chi-Town
Man, you know what I'm sayin'
West side of the west side to me homie
Bankhead represent

[Verse 1: T.I.]
I don't sneak dissin' and no weak niggas
I'm paid on like chief niggas
On the west side with Chief Keef nigga
Fresh strong path, we chief nigga
I'm a young OG street nigga
You try me and we creep
With a fully auto, pull up on your block and we skeet niggas
Fuck boy be on fuck shit that's why I don't need greet niggas
Say what's up then get gone, get shot at, you get wrong
Where all the dough that I'm getting?

Catch me right now on the west side of the Chi Town, go hundred
In the A-Town I'm the king, best bow down, 100

[Hook: Chief Keef]

A snitch nigga, that's that shit I don't like, nah
Don't like, like, don't like, like

[Verse 2: Trae tha Truth]
I'm king, sittin' in my chair nigga
Try to take me off, I dare you nigga
Tell me something that's real nigga
Any hood, I'm there nigga
And look don't stare nigga
Diamonds got me looking like a flare nigga
Look bitch, I'm an asshole
Fuck everybody up, 'bout to take you down nigga
Broke niggas I don't like, neck looking like show lights

Bitch I'm talkin' Snow White

No flute, I'm a show her how to play your pipe
Fuck is you thinking?
Ain't no one realer than me in this bitch
What the fuck is you drinking?
Tipping this water
Bitch I'm so deep in the gutter to the point you'd think I was sinking
I don't really give a fuck, I'm off in this jungle
Look at this jacket I'm minkin'
Everything got to a movie, it ain't my fault if you missed it
Shouldn't have been blinking
Nigga fuck about 'er my way
Alicia try'na go to sleep
I don't fuck with you bitches who brand new
Tell 'em this dick ain't for cheap

Shout to Teresa, shout out to Sosa
Shout out to Waka, shout out to me
Yea I'm a let my nuts hang like a poster
