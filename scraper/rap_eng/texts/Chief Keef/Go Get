Go getcha gun, go getcha funds
Go get police, go getcha your moms
Go getcha your hundreds and your ones
I'm at your head, go get the Feds
Where is it? Go get your bread
Boy four Peace, we mean no legs
You's a lil boy, go get your parents, hey hey
You don't get the pic, go get your lense

We a go getter, all my boys, gon' getcha
We do not pull up, my boys, no anger
Went and got a new nina, and I'm gon' finger it
Went and got some under on you, I'm gon' send with
Went and got a big house for my kids
I still ain't even get props for what I did
I still believe in God, not true, I'm scared
Went and got a gun just for my fears
I need to go get me another car
And I need to go get me another watch
Need another chain, another house, another Glock
Need to go get some more clothes and some more guap
Told that bitch "You got a car?" Then go get it
Thought Almighty So was gonna come getcha
Bitch I'm gonna get dope and some more swishers
That bitch better go on get liquor and some more bitches
That money, I'mma go get it
All around me already know that shit
Cause I'm gonna get that shit
Niggas be on that ho ass shit
I'm gonna get my gun out my pocket and blow that bitch
I'm gonna get my gun out my pocket and blow that bitch
