Choppers gettin' let off
Now, they don't want no war
30 clips and them .45's, gotta go back to the sto'
And that Kush gettin' smoked, gotta go back to the sto'
Cock back 'cause there's trouble, my mans gon' blow
So they ass better get low or get hit
Oh, shit!
That Bulldog made his ass split
I'm tryna get rich, fuck a bitch
Only thing she for is to give head
I'm talkin' this dick
If she snitch, she can get the 30 clip
All we know is bang and then dip
And them bangers hollow tips
I swear to God, that shit dead
Let's show these niggas how we do it
We got big hawks and Eagles that's gon' knock you out yo shoes
You better be a smart nigga
On that R.I.P. Dart, nigga
Two bangers, going hard, nigga
Soft nigga, go hard, nigga!

Glock nine, TEC-9, 30 clip, .45
When I hit him, he ain't comin' back
Smokin' loud, this Buddy loud, so I ain't comin' back
And I'm Chief Keef, bitch
Off a pill, I feel like E.T., bitch
When I hit, you spin like a CD, bitch
Can't get caught by CPD, bitch
My nigga Dooski, he got my back
Just bring a nine, we ain't got a MAC
You better listen, we got a MAC
And on your back, we make the 'Nolia clap
We got 50-shot TEC's, so don't get wet
We gon' make some bullets rain on your block
Your bitch suckin' all on my cock
On the block, we the chop shop
Smokin' stank, all I know is bang
Fuck run a train, we gon' roll a train
Big propane like Novacaine
Chief Keef, bitch, I'm so insane
It's Glory Boys, Lamron
Wic City and Blake Gate
Young Money and 46
Flip a nigga like patty cake
