[Hook]
Bitch, I'm smoking on these trees
Flowing on these beats
She like "Sosa don't be mean, can I see yo car keys"
Bitch, is you crazy?
You ain't know me before they payed me
Now that I'm Sosa baby
You wanna have my baby
Beamer, Bentley, and Mercedes
Dada that's how Kay Kay be
Blat blat that's how AK be
I'm just getting off these drugs with my thing off safety

[Verse]
Getting off these drugs and I got my gat, bitch
See a opp, shit still gon' get hectic
They like Sosa on that new shit
Nah, Sosa on that next shit
Why niggas on that old shit?
Niggas rapping like the old me
Thought that I ain't know, bitch
But I don't get no shit
Cause I'm with Glo, bitch
And you know we smoking
And you know we toting
See yo big bitch ass, you know we blowing
