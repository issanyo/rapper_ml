[Intro:]
(You know what the fuck I want, nigga
Give me your motherfucking jewelry, nigga
Take that shi..)
Ay, Ay

[Refrain:]
Chest up, skrr skrr with your vest up
Gratata with the chopper, leave your block messed up
Ketchup, tell that nigga catch up
Ridin' real fast, cops behind, told 'em catch up

[Verse:]
You stuck in mayonnaise, catch up
You got mayonnaise ways, catch up
And mustard, catch up
Mustard mothafucka
Heinz
You get red for this green of mine
It's mine (it's mines, nigga)
For that green, we come through causin' crimes
We ain't droppin' dimes
We just poppin' dimes
Got a lotta dimes
Committed a lot of crime
I'm Tony big homie
I got this Arab bitch on me
And she blem my shit, homie
We ain't for none of it, homie
