[Hook: Tadoe]
Remember running in houses and riding steamers
Now I pull up mansions, foreign Beamers
That bitch she all on me, take a breather
A nigga tryna rob me, I'ma leave 'em
Catch a nigga lacking, let 'em have it
I'ma buy 10 traps instead of a mansion
Nigga don't want no smoke, he scared of that cancer
Nigga don't want no money, I think he scared of that cabbage

[Verse: Chief Keef]
Tadoe say he gon' buy 10 traps instead of a mansion
Well I'm gon' buy a mansion instead of 10 traps
Cause I got indicted doing that shit already
And the judge already tryna send my black ass back
Pussy you better watch that back
That bitch gave me top but it's not that bad
Cause you know I got that bag
Took the bitch to my house and she seen that maid taking out that thrash
Bitch these Balenciagas on my feet
These ain't no damn 11's or no 5's
Niggas tote revolvers for the heat
Niggas ain't shooting no 4-O's or 4-5's
Give Tadoe the 30, my 4-O toting 4-5
Blood Money got the Mac and he gon' pimp your ride
Niggas ain't getting no cabbage
Took 20 G's mothafucka, and I counted that shit backwards
Say he gon' squeeze, he gon' fuck it, but I doubt if that shit happen
Tryna kill me mothafucka, like tryna kill Captain America
Wanna see a chain, Chief Sosa bought 84 carats
And I'm only 18 mothafucka, but you still live with your parents
Niggas with heaters be feature
Fucking on that Keisha
That bitch say she see us but her face ain't believe us
Gon' eat us like a pizza
Cause I'm cool like a freezer
Remember riding steamers but now I can have 10 Beamers
