I smoke tookah, he smoke oh no
Hi, Miss Codeine, I just want you to know
That all I want is you, if you only knew
I don't care about your ex baby, he not on channel 2
He's not on the news, I don't know the dude
I know you want me and I want you too
What are hungry for? I'm out here gettin' food
You tryna sell me some red, you can get sued

[Verse]
Me and purple got a contract together
We make goals like we raised a runnin' back together
No you can't get none of drink, you prolly got ebola
All this gank I pour, I think I'm a professional skin toner, bang
Why would I lie to you baby?
I only sip you, I sip red? girl you crazy
Tell my assassinate, go get ice, boy you lazy
Your man sippin' yellow, if I sip green, you can tase me
I aim with the red, how much you wanna bet me?
I don't sip qualitest, knock me out if you catch me
I don't sip no label stretch me out if you catch me
You tryna see me hit, broadcast you on this here .50

I smoke tookah, he smoke oh no

I know you want me and I want you too
What are you on me for? I'm out here gettin' food
You tryna sell me some red, you can get sued
