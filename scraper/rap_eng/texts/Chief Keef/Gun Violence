[Hook: Fredo Santana]
Turnt up bitch, I'm super cappin
Turnt up bitch, I got them stupid weapons
Turnt up bitch, kill you in a second
Turnt up bitch, somebody call 9-11
They like "Fredo be cool, man you too turnt"
They like "Fredo be cool, somebody finna get murked"
I don't wanna have to put you on a t-shirt
I don't wanna have to put you in the fucking dirt
They like "Fredo be cool, boy your ass wild"
I don't give a fuck, nigga I'm with that gun violence
I'm with that gun violence, I'm with that gun violence
I don't give a fuck nigga, I'm with that gun violence

[Verse 1: Fredo Santana]
I don't wanna have to put you in a fucking hearse
Whole family rocking you on a t-shirt
Stay your ass in your lane, boy the streets hurt
Pull up on your block and see if my heat work
We can get some money or we can beef first
Pull up on your set and shoot whoever I see first
Damn, I done got blood on my t-shirt
Look down got his brain on my sneakers
Kick his ass out the trap, he selling cheap work
Pistol slap his momma til her teeth jerk
I'm with that gun violence, I'm with that gun violence
I don't give a fuck, nigga I'm with that gun violence

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
We put you on a milk carton
Pull up pull your pimp card
You a Will Ferrell, get hard, mean time I sip hard
Drive through, no smalls, aye, cuz I live large
Pull up, get the count, pull off like I didn't park
All red Louie, yeah I be on my santa shit
How these racks hang off me, what is that? banner bitch
12 poured up, in a soda, is not a Fanta bitch
Pulled up in the night light, it's not a candle bitch
I know how to make these bands
And your bitch know how to make me mad
Blood watch over my shoulder, Cap watch over the racks
Shawty go watch for police, Fredo watch over the trap
