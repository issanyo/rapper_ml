[Verse 1: S.Dot]
I'm runnin' shit, my gun'll spit
100 clips, 600 shit
I'm Dotarachi, bitch I'm Dotarachi
Let me get myself together 'fore the paparazzi
I'm goin' hard, I'm ballin' out
I'm Debo to these lil niggas, stomp 'em out
I'm posted up, can't guard me man
Off loud, sleep walkin' like a zombie man
OG 'n me in the crib, my bitch need a rack
Now I'm in the trap, tryna make it back
My shooters got shooters, for real doe
District Hustlaz on top hoe, for real hoe
My nigga Edai got the Eagle so you better chill
It's rainin' bullets outside hoe it's been a drill
They say the boy's this, but nobody know 'em
Who the fuck is you? Just a fucking stupid
No L's I get chauffeured in a fucking coupe
Sneak dissin' that'll get you on the local news
I got some killas over east who'll kill a nigga
Call me Mr. No Hands, I don't feel you niggas

[Hook: S.Dot]
Out here on the block, each and every day
Drillin' with the guys, out here gettin' paid
OG 'n me in the crib, my bitch need a rack
Now I'm in the trap, tryna make it back
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Bitch I hustle hard, bitch I hustle hard

[Verse 2: Edai]
Rappin' off my spot bitch
Defense runnin' no options
30 off in my pocket
It's too fast know that we droppin'
Gettin' these niggas like coffins
Smokin' loud no coughin'
Drillin' hard no options
Got yo bitch her pussy she poppin'
45 we shoppin'
100 thousand in our wallets
Tryna to stain us? Stop it
Tell broski, pussy he pop 'em
We drilled out them drills though
Blue dolphin popped pills too
Big 30 them drills do
Fuck around and get killed too
Sippin' lean, I'm off that
Drinkin' syrup my cough bad
600 you big dummies
Tell broski 'nem to get off that
Polo shoes, Polo golf hat
True Religion they cause bands
You fuck around with the fuckin' rounds
You fuck around and get popped then

[Hook: Edai]
Out here on the block, each and every day
Drillin' with the guys, out here gettin' paid
OG 'n me the crib, my bitch need a rack
Now I'm in the trap, tryna make it back
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Bitch I hustle hard, bitch I hustle hard

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Pelle Pelle on my back man
These bitches know when I come around
When it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Like show and tell, we show around
She go around, she go around
She with the team, she goin' down
Smokin' loud, I'm on the pounds
Tell broski 'nem let off rounds
I'm in the hood, these niggas know
Ain't never seen you over here before
And Z-Bro my hit for low
He with me, then he'll blow
Chief Keef on this beat
Tell 'em niggas to get beef
You fuck wit me, you fuck wit me
My niggas'll put you 6 feet
D-E-E-P, no contacts you see me
Only 17 and my name ring
Man it's a drill bitch ding ding
He get shot, in his face
Now this life, my 6 take
Bitch made, he get played
We poke him and I get payed

[Hook: Chief Keef]
Out here on the block, each and every day
Drillin' with the guys, out here gettin' paid
OG 'n me in the crib, my bitch need a rack
Now I'm in the trap, tryna make it back
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Hustle, hustle, hustle, hard
Bitch I hustle hard, bitch I hustle hard
