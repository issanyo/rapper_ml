[Intro]
Yeah bitch, I'm back Terintino Gang where yo jocks at nigga?
I got my sig on me right now

[Hook]
Yeah bitch the Grim Reaper
Smoking on this Tooka pack this shit got me tweakin'
If a nigga talking crazy Imma up fajita
Keep walkin' back and forth lookin' out for people
I can't serve you boy you look suspect like them people
If he holdin' weight then his ass got faneto
Me and Tadoe off the molly ride AMG hoe
All white Forgi's mounted up you know how we Glo

[Verse 1]
Where the fuck my money yeah you owe me couple hunchos
Hop out 18 niggas at yo mf front door
I'm all about my cheese I need my mf nachos
Finna fly my Mama to Cali and put her ass in a condo
Remember posted on the block smokin' Tooka up in bandos
Now just to show my face you better up them damn hunchos
Now I'm poppin' out flexin' walkin' round with bout 3 hoes
She know I don't trick off she can't get none of my hunchos
All white Audi truck mounted on Villanos

Serve yo ass through the window, you look like the po po (Is you them people bitch?)

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Bitch my pockets on sumo

And I'm riding in that you know
But i don't know the name I just know it got 2 doors
Yeah bitch im Kobe 24
I be overflexing bitch look I be too glowed
I ain't lackin' I got 2 poles
If you run up on me you gon' feel all typa hollows
On the E-way bitch I'm flexing in that Jumbo
I'm with my killers we gon leave you in the jungle
And if you over tax the gang we gon rob you
Thinkin' that this shit a game we gon clap you
(Thinkin' that it's sweet bitch)

[Hook]
