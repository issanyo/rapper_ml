[Intro]
Bang, Bang, Bang
I got a bag, hold up
Gino got a bag
Sosa got a bag
Y'all know

[Hook: Ballout]
I got a bag but I ain't braggin'
I know these niggas mad because i'm swaggin'
You say they ain't even mad tell me why they mad then?
GBE the set and bitch we some savages

[Verse 1: Ballout]
Yeah I got big chains off my ass girl I be swaggin'
Runnin' through all this damn cash I coulda bought an Aston
Instead I bought some thirties and some mack tens
All these bitches on my dick because I don't be braggin'
I wear everyday but Gino is no lackin'
Bitch I be crackin' you better haven't
Everybody know 300 team no stackin'
If we catch an opp then we gon fuckin break his back then

[Hook] 2X

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I got a bag so a hundred on the hoe
We pull up on the opps, let these lammas blow!
I'm smoking on the dope , thumbing through this roll
Got so much damn cash I coulda bought a Hummer 4
I be stuntin' on the hoes don't know why I bother though
I know we be gettin' dough we pull up with all this dough
My clout is all the best I love braggin'
Fifteen hundred on the belt coulda bought some Mac-10s
Bang, Bang

[Hook] 2X

[Verse 3: Gino Marley]
I got a bag, so I be cashin'
Chains be hanging off my ass bitch i'm just swaggin'
We be runnin' through them bands but I ain't braggin'
Way i'm throwin' all this cash I coulda bought an Aston
Thumbin' through these grants it's a habit
Getting money is a must but I ain't braggin'
Niggas hate cause they mad tell me why they mad then
GBE the squad and we some savages

[Hook] 2X
