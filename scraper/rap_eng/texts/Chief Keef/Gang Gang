[Hook]
30 get the vocals, laying down on Protools
My expensive snow shoes, vegetarian tofu
Big Ben Franklin, I love you
Loyalty I love you more
Cheese on my fingers, but I ain't talking doritos
Put a bitch on the plane
Since I get cash, I ain't been the same
I spend two grands
In case get caught up in the rain
These boys fuckin' lame
They sure love the gang
Walking in the store like, (Gang Gang)
Everybody know, (Gang Gang)

[Verse 1]
Who they locking up? (Gang)
Who the hoes gon' fuck? (Gang Gang)
Who they need to free? (Gang)
Who put niggas to sleep? (Gang Gang)
Who need to be on a leash? (Gang)
