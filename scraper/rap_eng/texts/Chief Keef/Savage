[Intro]
Sosa baby
GBE baby

[Chorus]
My young boys clap heat
My young boys don't care
Yeah, them O'Block boys savage
Boy, don't go over there
They shootin' shit on site
Guns bangin' like a snare
And if you think that you is tough
And you get popped oh well
Cause my young niggas savage
My young niggas savage
They stay with the ratchets
Cause my young niggas savage
My young miggas savage
My young niggas savage
Hope you got your ratchet
Cause my young niggas savage

[Verse 1]
I'm posted on O'Block
Smoking dope with BossTop
And he totin' the Tech 9
A hundred shots please don't get popped
And Edai he got the Glock
Boy don't get your cock chopped
Don't stunt on O'Block
Or spend your life on a watch
T-Roy he got the semi
He'll send yo ass to heaven
All you scary mothafuckaz
Go to church see a reverend
This ain't no diss song
This a message
My young boyz savage
No lackin' or they stretchin'
Now, this shit done got hectic

[Chorus]
My young boys clap heat
My young boys don't care
Yeah, them O'Block boys savage
Boy, don't go over there
They shootin' shit on site
Guns bangin' like a snare
And if you think that you is tough
And you get popped oh well
Cause my young niggas savage
My young niggas savage
They stay with the ratchets
Cause my young niggas savage
My young miggas savage
My young niggas savage
Hope you got your ratchet
Cause my young niggas savage


[Verse 2]
We put that Jimmy Iovine money in the trap
Shoutout to Young Scooter man he taught me that
We put poles in all our videos they copied that
Got Brutus on they car no Forgiatos damn
You Brick ass niggas don't know what to do
Y'all broke and y'all tired and y'all so confused
You don't know me, I'm Big Gucci Sosa to you
Disrespect my set then it's over for you
My young boys walkin up and it's over with you
You ain't talking money, my convo over with you
My young boys walking up and it's over with you
You ain't talking money, my convo over with you

[Chorus]
My young boys clap heat
My young boys don't care
Yeah, them O'Block boys savage
Boy, don't go over there
They shootin' shit on site
Guns bangin' like a snare
And if you think that you is tough
And you get popped oh well
Cause my young niggas savage
My young niggas savage
They stay with the ratchets
Cause my young niggas savage
My young miggas savage
My young niggas savage
Hope you got your ratchet
Cause my young niggas savage
