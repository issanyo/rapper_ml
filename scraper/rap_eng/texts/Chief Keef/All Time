[Intro]
Glo Gang
Holiday, sup bro..
Tell them what we got?

[Hook]
AK, shotgun
We let off shots and we watch y'all run
Y'all dumb, y'all ain't getting no money
I'm flexing on these suckas all the time
Spend my money, it's all mines
Running through a hundred thousand cause I get money all the time
Say they getting money, they all lying
I think I'm the youngest flexer of all time

[Verse 1]
I'm on this dope, I'm all high
Just bought a new gun, let's go do a drive-by
Ain't even gotta do it, my niggas gone do a drive-by
You better duck, lil goons finna shoot ya graa graa
I will never snitch and I will not lie
Nigga try to take my jewelry bye bye
No bitch, I don't want no pussy bye bye
If yo' nigga think itâ€™s cookies graa graa

[Hook]
AK, shotgun
We let off shots and we watch y'all run
Y'all dumb, y'all ain't getting no money
I'm flexing on these suckas all the time
Spend my money, it's all mines
Running through a hundred thousand cause I get money all the time
Say they getting money, they all lying
I think I'm the youngest flexer of all time

[Verse 2]
She gave me top, like she know how
Tell me why you bitches do that all the time
I got some Cubans that'll do it all the time
Used to move dope got some niggas that do it all the time
I used to rob I got some niggas that will do it all the time
And on sheroid bitch I was shooting all the time
I'm from O'Block where they be shooting all the time
But we ain't worried because we got all the guns
Bitch, we got...

[Hook]
AK, shotgun
We let off shots and we watch y'all run
Y'all dumb, y'all ain't getting no money
I'm flexing on these suckas all the time
Spend my money, it's all mines
Running through a hundred thousand cause I get money all the time
Say they getting money, they all lying
I think I'm the youngest flexer of all time
