Every damn day I'm taking chances, Every damn day I'm taking chances
Anything happen I can handle it, I'm addicted to this gambling
Gambling with my life, I'm gambling with my life
I'm gambling with my life, I'm gambling with my life
Every damn day I'm taking chances, cause I'm addicted to this gambling

[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
Addicted to these streets
Diamonds and money
Taking chances for my kids
Cambien Money
Stomach full of Freebands
But i jugg like I'm hungry
Even if i ain't got no bands
I still look like money
I finesse you out your cash
Then dress up like I'm homeless
Niggas still screaming drought
When birds everywhere floating
You take a chance you fuck with me
I hate when you buss it open
I'm selling wet it won't lock
I got juggs I motion
Gotta sell it how it look
It'll crumble up on you
36's look like books, you get 7 for 100
Jugg with these OG bosses
I don't be around runners
I never think about a loss
I just keep getting money

[Hook]
Every damn day I'm taking chances, Every damn day I'm taking chances
Anything happen i got handlers, I'm addicted to this gambling
Gambling with my life, I'm gambling with my life
I'm gambling with my life, I'm gambling with my life
Every damn day I'm taking chances, cause I'm addicted to this gambling


[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Taking chances, taking chances taking chances aye
Bitch I'm shining from my wrist up to my necklace aye
God came and got me, bless me hachoo aye
Glo Gang posted like a statue aye
Taking chances having this bitch in my hotel aye
But my niggas with me rolling like a ferris wheel aye
Taking chances having this pipe up in my car aye
But I rather get caught with then without it aye
Taking chances no security everywhere I go aye
It's me and Glo no security at my show aye
Taking chances I got all my jewelry on aye
Taking chances something long up in my chrome


[Hook]
Every damn day I'm taking chances, Every damn day I'm taking chances
Anything happen I got handlers, I'm addicted to this gambling
Gambling with my life, I'm gambling with my life
I'm gambling with my life, I'm gambling with my life
Every damn day I'm taking chances, cause I'm addicted to this gambling

[Verse 3: Young Scooter]
My momma mad at me cause I gamble too much
I had 200,000 in high school but I fucked it all up
I took a chance on the road just to run it back up
And then these niggas started snitching, I had to switch my route up (Iâ€™m gone)
I dry my own packs I love gambling
Shooting dice, I done throwed my whole hand in
A free 75,000 I done cashed in
Police get behind me I be smashing
7 days a week I'm taking chances
I can't get no sleep I keep on gambling
Lost 20 bricks last week, but I can stand it
But won a quarter million betting on Kansas
