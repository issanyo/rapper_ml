[Intro]
Huh?
Umm
Lean, lean
Skrr, Skrr skrr skrr
Bang bang, bang bang

[Hook]
Boy, I'ma catch it, teach you a lesson
He be texting, and we be sexing
I'm dressed in designer, and she be naked
And She go up and down, I'm like let's get it, let's get it
Girl you got a hold of me, don't let go of me
I'm sorry but I can't eat it like groceries
I'm sipping on lean and smoking on OG
You don't have to worry, girl it's just you and me

[Verse]
She like, what were you doing with your friends at 2 AM
Sipping lean like soup, I'm finna pick you up in this coupe, what it do
I don't see nothing wrong with a gangster being on your mind
You know I got them bands
You can't throw shade because I was taught to shine

[Hook]
Boy, I'ma catch it, teach you a lesson
He be texting, and we be sexing
I'm dressed in designer, and she be naked
And She go up and down, I'm like let's get it, let's get it
Girl you got a hold of me, don't let go of me
I'm sorry but I can't eat it like groceries
I'm sipping on lean and smoking on OG
You don't have to worry, girl it's just you and me
