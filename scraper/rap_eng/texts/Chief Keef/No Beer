[Intro]
Don't care 'bout no cameras
[?]
That bitch only want to fuck with me
'Cause I got my bands up
Damn right
I'm T'd, feel me?

[Hook]
I'm Almighty So-So
'Member I used to sell co-co
Got rich off of rapping now I can go buy a whole boat
Oops, I meant a whole yacht
Check out my earlobes though
Boy your shit look fu-fu
Johnny got me fucked up
Let me check where i parked a car
I'm Chief Sosa
Bitch up on this GLO wagon let's go on this GLO [?]
And I think it's Christmas, got so many Ho Hoe's
I got all the bitches cause I get all the dough

[Verse 1]
And I cough so damn much, 'cause I smoke so much dope
No I don't fuck with them bricks but all my niggas cut throat
Don't care 'bout no cameras, so what you try run for
Nigga's silly, die out, they lil' ass is done for
I'm T-T'd up on this pill, chiefin' keefer
I'm movin' slow, I just put four in a two liter
Get your hoe before I turn to a believer
That bitch sweating me, and I don't want no fever
Bitch I'm 17, I don't want no beer
Fuck with lean, I don't want no beer
I'mma fuck her once, then I don't want to see her
I got what you want, whoa boy I'm serious
They like, "Sosa boy the war boy for real"
Tadoe done got them hoes off a pill
These niggas fake, I'm ballin' out for real
You think I give a fuck 'bout how you feel?

[Verse 2]
They say I don't care enough...
