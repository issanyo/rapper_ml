[Hook]
I'm toting a big ass, bone crusher
Excuse him, he don't know better
Now watch him, go through yo leather
Like click-clack we're on your schedule
If you knew better, you would do better
I'm getting money now, I used to shoot niggas
Who that in the cut? It's the crew nigga
Them my dogs boy don't make me let 'em loose nigga

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Bring my dogs out the cut with the sticks
I might just pop out the cut with ya bitch
I'm up in the club in the cut with the shits
Rolling whole pounds and I'm pouring whole bricks
I can't talk to you pussy boy you's a narc
Thinking shit was sharp hit yoyr ass with a dart
Hop up in this foreign hit your ass with the car
Thinking that you cold put this heat to your heart
I got King Kong in my blunt
I got Donkey Kong in the trunk
I got Ceaser in my backpack
Up this bitch and go grat-grat

[Hook]
I'm toting a big ass, bone crusher
