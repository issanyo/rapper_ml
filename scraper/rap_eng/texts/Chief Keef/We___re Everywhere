[Intro]
We over here, we over there
We over here, we over there, ayy

[Hook]
We over here, we over there
We everywhere, you never there
Rock Human Races, got every pair
We're here and there, we're everywhere
My team, yeah, here, there, they're everywhere
I got these 700s everywhere
And my coat made out of fuckin' bear
I still got Yeezy's I didn't fuckin' wear

[Verse 1]
You dig? These diamonds everywhere
Leave the restaurant, the paparazzi everywhere
I swear this bitch so freaky, she gon' top me anywhere
Yeah I got on my chains and I'ma rock 'em anywhere
Trippin' over shit 'cause I got designer everywhere
Just flew a lil' lady out, but I her hair is sheddin' everywhere
Send her fine ass right back, without an ordinary care
And the kicks thats on my toes are not an ordinary pair
My house got TVs everywhere
Three here, three there, three there, three there
I ain't gotta type and I sure don't got a care
For the Pledge of Allegiance I'm sitting down in my chair
You cannot check me, 'less you writin' a check to me
Act like she don't be everywhere tryna fool me
Bitch went to the bathroom, she was trippin' over NMDs
Welcome to the show, this is a Chief Sosa assembly
She love the Glo Gang briefs, she stop suckin', said "I'm stealing these"
Diamonds in my bezel, lookin like motherfuckin' earrings
And this white gold, this ain't motherfuckin' sterling
Had to tell my bitch, "get out your motherfuckin' feelings"

[Hook]
We over here, we over there
We everywhere, you never there
Rock Human Races, got every pair
We're here and there, we're everywhere
My team, yeah, here, there, they're everywhere
I got these 700s everywhere
And my coat made out of fuckin' bear
I still got Yeezy's I didn't fuckin' wear

[Verse 2]
I got shit I forgot about
Bitch, your weak ass service goin' in and out
FN a blow dryer, air you out (aye)
I'm doing too much loud, can't hear you out (aye)
What these is, bitch? These AMIRI
She ask me somethin', I told her bitch ask SIRI
They like "where you get "Almighty So" from?", from Jim Carrey
Cops shot 17, shots they missed, that's legendary
Aye, 762, Hail Mary, make shit, very scary
I don't give a fuck if y'all everywhere, spread a little bit fire everywhere
Off-White everywhere
Plus [?] trippin' my Hellcat, that bitch fishtailin' anywhere
Bitch I got Bape everywhere and I got apes everywhere
Swear the bitch head was a fairy tale
I'm a lion so I got a hairy tail
Got a thong-wearin' pussy from Riverdale
Way she give it to me, she don't give a damn
Got a bitch from 8 mile like Eminem sell the SL11 for some M&Ms (bang)

[Chorus]
We over here, we over there
We everywhere, you never there
Rock Human Races, got every pair
We're here and there, we're everywhere
My team, yeah, here, there, they're everywhere
I got these 700s everywhere
And my coat made out of fuckin' bear
I still got Yeezy's I didn't fuckin' wear
