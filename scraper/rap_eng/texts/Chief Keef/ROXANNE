[Intro]
Aye, Dnny Phntm, you made this shit?
1k

[Chorus: Ca$tro Guapo]
Drop my top, she get off her tot
Gettin' head from a thot, think her name Roxanne
Lean, lean, Wock, bitch, I ain't gon' stop
Only pour straight drop, think I need more Xans
Your bitch on go, got the blicks on go
But the clip so long, can't fit in my pants
Chain on froze, gotta wipe my nose
I don't need no flash just to make these dance
Drop my top, she get off her tot
Gettin' head from a thot, think her name Roxanne
Lean, lean, Wock, bitch, I ain't gon' stop
Only pour straight drop, think I need more Xans
Your bitch on go, got the blicks on go
But the clip so long, can't fit in my pants
Chain on froze, gotta wipe my nose
I don't need no flash just to make these dance

[Verse 1: Ca$tro Guapo]
Quit playin', C-M-D-W-N on my chain
You fool, quicksand, chopper bullets cook a nigga like ham
You cute, my son, lil nigga tryna be like his dad
Do you, I'm sayin', stop downloadin' sauce from my Gram
Red Bimmer so you better think fast
Yeah, 'cause you know we ain't goin' out sad
Won't hit your line 'cause I'm all about bands
Blow the show money, spend it all on Acme
Make it all back, spend it all on Raf
Since I went broke, said I ain't goin' back
Niggas say it's rap but I swear it's all cap
You ain't got fans 'cause your music all trash

[Chorus: Ca$tro Guapo]
Drop my top, she get off her tot
Gettin' head from a thot, think her name Roxanne
Lean, lean, Wock, bitch, I ain't gon' stop
Only pour straight drop, think I need more Xans
Your bitch on go, got the blicks on go
But the clip so long, can't fit in my pants
Chain on froze, gotta wipe my nose
I don't need no flash just to make these dance
Drop my top, she get off her tot
Gettin' head from a thot, think her name Roxanne
Lean, lean, Wock, bitch, I ain't gon' stop
Only pour straight drop, think I need more Xans
Your bitch on go, got the blicks on go
But the clip so long, can't fit in my pants
Chain on froze, gotta wipe my nose
I don't need no flash just to make these dance

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Catch up, bang, bang
Don't care what hoes say, call me Jose
I got dreadlocks like Buckwheat, Otay
Cops tryna lock me up, it's on low bay
At the Wells Fargo, don't go to Chase
New, mix Gucci with the Yeezys
White diamonds look like Fiji
I'm the sauce power, call me Speedy
My new wrist a Lamborghini
Crawled out fresher than a genie
Your bitch on my head like a beanie
What's in the Glock, it's weenie
You know I got greens, Cabrini

[Chorus: Ca$tro Guapo]
Drop my top, she get off her tot
Gettin' head from a thot, think her name Roxanne
Lean, lean, Wock, bitch, I ain't gon' stop
Only pour straight drop, think I need more Xans
Your bitch on go, got the blicks on go
But the clip so long, can't fit in my pants
Chain on froze, gotta wipe my nose
I don't need no flash just to make these dance
Drop my top, she get off her tot
Gettin' head from a thot, think her name Roxanne
Lean, lean, Wock, bitch, I ain't gon' stop
Only pour straight drop, think I need more Xans
Your bitch on go, got the blicks on go
But the clip so long, can't fit in my pants
Chain on froze, gotta wipe my nose
I don't need no flash just to make these dance
