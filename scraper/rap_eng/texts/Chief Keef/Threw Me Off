[Intro]
You threw me off with that

[Chorus]
You threw me off with that fuck shit, you thew me off
You threw me off with that love shit, she thew me off
You threw me off, say she love me, that bitch might as well find a cliff
You threw me off, rolling joints and the cops tryna catch me slipping
You threw me off, I was minding my damn bidness, aye
Don't make me send my lil niggas up out them trenches
Threw ya off, like fuck boy you shouldn't've
You threw me off, if you wanna fuck, boy, you wouldn't've
You threw me off

[Verse]
I took a throw away gun and I threw it off
Throw some money up just to throw it off
'Member having throw away crack up in my balls
The dead boys coming down the alley, throw 'em off
These shells, I throw 'em all, I blow 'em all
This silencer at the top, it throw 'em off
And after she give my top, I throw her off
I will be in the sky before the referee throw the ball
Office tryna throw me off, I broke the rim and broke the ball
Feds tryna throw me off, [?]
Niggas tryna throw me off, tryna set me up, get me gone
Bitches tryna throw me off, say they love me, I know they don't

[Chorus]
You threw me off with that fuck shit, you thew me off
You threw me off with that love shit, she thew me off
You threw me off, say she love me, that bitch might as well find a cliff
You threw me off, rolling joints and the cops tryna catch me slipping
You threw me off, I was minding my damn bidness
Don't make me send my lil niggas up out them trenches
Threw ya off, like fuck boy you shouldn't've
You threw me off, if you wanna fuck, boy, you wouldn't've
You threw me off

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You threw me off with that fuck shit, you thew me off
You threw me off with that love shit, she thew me off
You threw me off, say she love me, that bitch might as well find a cliff
You threw me off, rolling joints and the cops tryna catch me slipping
You threw me off, I was minding my damn bidness
Don't make me send my lil niggas up out them trenches
Threw ya off, like fuck boy you shouldn't've
You threw me off, if you wanna fuck, boy, you wouldn't've
You threw me off
