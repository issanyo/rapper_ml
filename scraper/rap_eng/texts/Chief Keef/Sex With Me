[Hook]
In Beverly Hills, riding Rarris
Shawty said she wanna do some Molly
I told that bitch that I do ecstasy
Now baby, is you gon' have sex with me
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Riding 'round Miami on cars
What I'm in? That fucking red Rarri
Then I take a trip to Lil Haiti
Hop out, the zoes on my safety
I was riding in a coupe
Me and Bally too
Then Ballout done brought a tool
Then we hit that other mall with a scope
Danced in it too
And I'm taking tours
I show up to your show
Unless you talking 'bout some rolls
I want 50 G's
You ain't got 50 G's, please
Don't talk to me
Bitch, don't offer me
Got 30 fucking G's
Bitch, I got 30 in my jeans
I spend 30 on some weed
Ship it up to the city
Windy city
Got my thirty up on me
And the birdies up on me
Your heard it's on me
They know that it's on me

[Verse 2]
I told 12 Million, Glo up
Don't get slow bucks, get Glo bucks
You be on the Glo toting bus
And we got about 50 shots
And we got about 50 thots
Think we just seen 'bout 50 opps
Time to let off 50 shots
Can you get 9 shots like 50?
Bitch, I turn a penny into 50
G's, aye
Got young jeans in my jeans
Got that heat in my jeans
Got your bitch in my jeans
She tryna suck me
She tryna love me
I ain't got time for lovey
All I got time for is money
