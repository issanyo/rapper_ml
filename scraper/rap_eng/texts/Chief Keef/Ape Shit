[Verse 1]
Remember selling blow out my grandma house
Now I got enough money, get grandma a house
Try to rob me I'ma pull that nina out
It's extended so the clip sticking out
You lil Mickey Mouse, don't be snitching now
Cause I'll send my hittas to come chase you down
Nina tote a dildo and she'll dick you down
He say he with the Clout, put him in the clouds
I'm thirsty, trigger finger itching now
Let me catch a nigga then it's nigga down
I was toting 50 now I'm Pippen now
I need to buy some missiles now

[Hook]
And go ape shit, go ape shit
Don't make us put them guns in rotation
Nina let me down then oh baby
We pulling out them choppers like the Haitians
Like the 80's, I'm going crazy
All this gwop, all these foreigns, baby
Lotta shots in all these guns baby
I know you wanna have my son, baby
