[Hook: Gucci Mane]
If your boyfriend selling bricks then why that boy can't pay your rent?
He can't pay your rent, he can't pay your rent
And that boy ain't who he say he is that boy there full of shit
That boy full of shit, that boy full of shit
Now I'm not your boyfriend, lame as hell and ain't that bout a bitch?
Ain't that bout a bitch, ain't that bout a bitch?
If your boyfriend selling bricks then why that boy can't pay your rent?
I can pay your rent, he can't pay your rent
Girl your baby daddy broke
He can't even come close to me that boy there is a joke
He can't even smoke with me cause Guwop selling dope
He got nothing over me cause el chapo my folk , folk , ho

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Smoking on that dope
Let your bitch hit it she choke, gang
I up this 4-0 and bang
Leave a nigga fucking brains on the pavement
Pulled off, escaping
Nigga wanna race me
But I only race thots
I chase gwop, I don't chase thots
I'm running from the cops
I'm dodging holes pots
Don't buy holes, I buy whole lots
Don't like lil bets I win whole pots

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Pussy gon crap out
Who that blowing, that's us
Me and the gang
Me and the gang in this thing
Cooling with Wop
Pull up on any nigga block and send a shot
We don't fear cops
Baby girl your boyfriend snitching on his boys

[Hook]
