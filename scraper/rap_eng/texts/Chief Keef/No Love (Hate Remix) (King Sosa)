[Intro: J Tuda]
I ain't got no love for no bitch
I ain't got no heart for no hoe
I ain't got no heart for no hoe

[Verse 1: J Tuda]
I ain't got no love for no bitch
I ain't got no heart for no hoe
You can get some of this glo
But your ass can't get no dough
Woah woah we can put it on the floor
Knock knock I'll be at a nigga door
Chop chop hitting through the peephole
You a hoe lil nigga that's glo
For dough they'll be at a nigga throat
No dough but he answer my hoes
'Cause you ain't Freddy Kruger with the score
I don't lose lil nigga I'm the goat
Well spoke make a nigga wanna quote
Grind hard make a nigga wanna croak
Get in his face 'till his ass go broke
'Cause hoe ass nigga you a joke
Get some bread 'fore beef for the loaf
Cook the burner on your ass now your toast
Six point niggas know I'm the folk
Double love remixed with the coke
Call up young head give a nigga smoke
Have your grandma pressed to the pole
It don't matter what float a nigga boat
Get wet, turn your ass to a ghost

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I'm smoking on this Tooka pack
You smoking on that fooka pack
Tell me where you do that at
Where the fuck do you be at?
I'm sipping on a brain surgeon
Got it from the doc shop
Fuck with Chief So
You'll end up in a chop shop
I got bread like I own Sara Lee
That be me
And I come through
And my car kicking like Jet Li
Turn your bread jelly
Smokers, that's deadly
You think you're smoking strong pack
Boy you smoking reggie
I was committing crimes
Now I'm committing millions
I was committing love
But love will get you killed
Get hit with this Pittsburgh steel
Get hit with a license chill
Get killed by the hands of a boss
Get killed by the hands of the mills
God damn it swag ODed
No seeds in my trees
100 in my AR
Doo-doo, it's knocking down trees
I'm posted up in Brightmo
With Cheeks and J-mo
Click-clack we'll leave your block
We giving out free halos
You gonna need security
Are you hearing me?
Are you fearing me?
Up this click-clack and terror be
I can sail my boat 'cause I'm the captain
And we sending free shots at your scalp lil nigga
Actually free shots like I'ma wet a nigga
Tag his ass up
I'ma spray can and spray a nigga
And Louie buying all the shit
I don't debate it nigga
And Gucci making me some brownies
I got cake lil nigga
What you smoking on? Blue dream?
Nah I'm straight lil nigga
Niggas put you in a trunk
Nah cradle a nigga
