[Intro: Chief Keef]
Yeah, Sosa, Soulja
Yeah, Sosa, Soulja

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm up now, up now, up now, up now
I'm up now
Riding round with the choppers right now

[Verse 1: Soulja Boy]
I'm up now, I'm up now
Lean got me stuck now, stuck now
Pulling up like what now? What now?
Two hands up, touchdown, touchdown
Baby drop that ass down
I'm counting this cash now
Floating on a pound of loud
Speaker beating so loud
Turnt up, can't turn me down
Piped up in the city, send a hundred rounds
In that Forgiato and I'm skrting through the town
Chopper bang like a gang sign
Lotta money coming and you know I'm getting it all the time
Badass bitch with some thick thighs
Yellow bone bitch with some red eyes
Hit it from the back
All I see is matte black paint on my 'llac
Smoking on dope, man and I'm serving packs
Posted in the trap with that 100 round strap

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm up now, up now, up now, up now
I'm up now
Riding round with the choppers right now
I'm up now, I'm up now
Riding with the chopper and the Draco right now
Riding with the .345 right now

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
I'm riding with this big ass Draco right now
Know Young Jeezy bitch bite down
I got a logo made and got it iced out
I got that bitch wet, bring the rice out
I'm sipping, cannabis, pouring up some mix
Bitch I'm in this foreign going special ed
You can catch these shells, while I catch the bread
I got these 762s put 'em in your head
I got a Fendi bag full of cash
I got a closet, that's full of swag
Hit the bank now
With the re-up deal, smoking weed your honor
Bang bang, bang bang
What you smoking on? You ain't smoking loud nigga
Got a fat chopper, shoot it at the crowd nigga
Enough weed on me to pass around nigga
Yeah I'm a Yung Joc cause it's going down nigga
Cops pull me over, I was full of smoke, woah
Ask me if I'm drunk and I said, oh no
I'm from the streets I don't rock with popos
I got my own going if you want smoke

[Hook: Soulja Boy]
I'm up now, up now, up now, up now
I'm up now
Riding round with the choppers right now
I'm up now, I'm up now
Riding with the chopper and the Draco right now
Riding with the .345 right now
