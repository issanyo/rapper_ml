[Intro]
Thotties, Posse!

[Hook]
I got alotta bitches, and I got alotta niggas
And I got alotta shooters and I got alotta killers
And I got alotta money, I been with this money bunny
I can't help my money funny, baby I am money hungry
More Sosa less Tony, I bought an island no stony dummy
I'm coolin in Hawaii, countin' money countin' money money
All these niggas phony phony, all these bitches bony bony
Niggas act like homies homies, that's why I be on it on it

[Verse 1]
Ridin' in that Moto Morini
Pockets filled with hundred money
I am not no dummy dummy
Pistol hit your tummy tummy
And I got a Tommy Tommy
Glock 10 marked doin' bunnies bunnies
He want beef its farmie farmie
We come through, army army
All we see is running running
Guess what, I am blunted blunted
This shit smells like onions onions
Trae Cas Stacy be smokin' that funny funny, funny
Swear that shit ain't funny funny

Then I might just bone it bone it
Walk in the label, then I run it run it
I need my cash at this fuckin' moment
This is business, we is not no homies
Don't make me catch a fuckin' homi

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Niggas act like they your friends
But niggas all pretend
Niggas act like they your homie
All these niggas fuckin' phony, I know it
Riding in that mortal combat
With a lot of fucking combat for combat
Nigga don't run, come back
Told your bitch "don't run, come back"
Take this dick, nigga clit clat get back
On that hot shit, you can get whacked
18 wheeler shit, you can get wet
Throw it back to my bitches

[Hook]
