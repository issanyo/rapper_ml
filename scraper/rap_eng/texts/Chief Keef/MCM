She say that I'm her MCM (girl you lyin')
But I dont wear no MCM (no I don't)
All I wear is Hermes when I do (I spend 15 bands)
Ridin' on, flexin' on you (like skr skr skr, skr skr skr)
She posted me up as her MCM (as her MCM)
But I don't wear no MCM (i don't wear no fuckin' MCM)
I spend 20 hundreds when I do (20 hundreds when I do)
Bitch I'm cold bitch I'm sick got the flu (bitch I'm sick got the flu)

[Verse 1]
She say I'm her MCM i be stuntin'
She say I'm her MCM i be swaggin' (swaggin' swag)
Hop up in my car and then I drive it
I mean I don't drive it I ride it fast
Put my feet to the gas
Smokin' on this gas
Put your shit in the trash
Shawty know that I'm the man
Seen my ice she like damn
Baby I dont need no fan
She seen my car she like damn

[Verse 2]
MCM, MCM, baby why am I your MCM?
Tell me now, tell me now
I don't ball bitch I Gretzky now
I don't fuck, bitch, don't let me down
I'm on point bitch on every sound
I'ma fly up you take the levi down
Always in something foreign I'm heavy now
Spend 50,000 in true religion
You spend 10,000 think you just shitted
It's Louis Vuitton for my lou-religion
They had Gucci for my gu-religion
