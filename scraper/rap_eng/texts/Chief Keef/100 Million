[Hook]
I need a hundred million, bout two times
And ten thousand dollar full times
My shorties now doing gang signs
I got loan money, all that hang time
Collect the real wards no milk carton
No Walmart cause we hit Targets
Take the package cheerily box it
In and out all day talking and walking

[Verse 1]
I’m a get it by any means necessary
I’m a go out fucking legendary
We bought the things through the bag go missionary
Cutting front line like the military
This shit through blood, sweat and dedication
Som’n wrong with the engine I think they laced it
Feds grab me for false investigation
All I know is ball that’s what I told em that’s how we played it
Feet down on the concrete
I know some niggas do anything for money
And they got three K’s new nazi’s
Hit a hundred six parks no roxy’s

[Hook]
I need a hundred million, bout two times
And ten thousand dollar full times
My shorties now doing gang signs
I got loan money, all that hang time
Collect the real wards no milk carton
No Walmart cause we hit Targets
Take the package cheerily box it
In and out all day talking and walking

[Verse 2]
I got on all white, I’m not a Nazi
I’m in a drop tower come and talk me
I’m in a new ‘Rrari going top speed
Police try to pull me over not me
I just pulled a six and I found I need a chaser
We on break it down we hoping you can take it
Blue cheese, facetime call when I kick it
California crib, ten gallons [?] the basement
It was basic, home runner pussy I’m the basic
Johnny Dan did the thing jewelry gang crazy

[Bridge]
The judge tryna give me life no I’m gon escape it
And I travel shooting darts you know I’m gon shake it

[Hook]
I need a hundred million, bout two times
And ten thousand dollar full times
My shorties now doing gang signs
I got loan money, all that hang time
Collect the real wards no milk carton
No Walmart cause we hit Targets
Take the package cheerily box it
In and out all day talking and walking
Bang
