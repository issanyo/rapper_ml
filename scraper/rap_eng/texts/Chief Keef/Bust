(Verse 1 : Chief Keef)
My diamonds dance like a jewel party, On my neck Bugatti
She so wet issa pool party
She ride me like Ducati
It's enough jewels on me for two bodies
Ooh Johnny, I only count the cash, Ion't count no punani
No star clique it's the ruler, Call me Chief Rick the Ruler
I'll get the pussy later, get the money sooner
That's ya ho im gon' do her, She's in the Uber
Tell Cash to order that shit, and order two hearses
Cuz I'm killin' these niggas, Hilary Billin' these niggas
Hilary Duffin' these niggas, Got bands and duff on me nigga
They like "Whats up with Keef nigga?
He went def on me nigga."
Naw that's these big ass earrings
Try me we (Bust on a nigga)
Pulled up in a hot car, with a hot fire
And we hot-boxing a hot car
Hop out of the hot car, with the hot ice
And I gotta thank my mama
Countin' all this Muhfuckin' green
And you know I gotta thank God too
Only thing I'm worryin' bout is waking up in the morning
Fuck what they say they goin do

(Chorus: Chief Keef) x 2
Bust on a nigga, (Try me, we bust)
(Bust on) Bust on a nigga (Try me, we bust)
(Bust on) Bust on a nigga (Try me, we bust)
(Bust on) Bust on a nigga (Try me, we bust)
