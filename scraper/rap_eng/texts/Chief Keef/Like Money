[Hook]
Why these niggas pillow talking, this bitch face in the pillow when she fucking
Pull up and valet my car cause I'm going to get this money
Hoping to the mothafucking money like a bunny
Going to the money and I'm smelling like money
You don't like money, you better like money
Wake up in the morning feeling like money
I got a green like money, yellow like money, red like money
Pull up in money, take the bitch up here, bet she'll like money

[Verse 1]
Obama like money, Michelle like money
All like money, Tadoe like money
12 Million like money, Terintino like money

[Hook]
Why these niggas pillow talking, this bitch face in the pillow when she fucking
Pull up and valet my car cause I'm going to get this money
Hoping to the mothafucking money like a bunny
Going to the money and I'm smelling like money
You don't like money, you better like money
Wake up in the morning feeling like money
I got a green like money, yellow like money, red like money
Pull up in money, take the bitch up here, bet she'll like money
