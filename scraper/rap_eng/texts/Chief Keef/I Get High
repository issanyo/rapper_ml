[Intro]
Get high, I get high, I get high, I get high
I get high, I get high, I get high
I get high on yo memory, high on yo memory
HIGH on yo memory... (gang gang)

[Hook]
I get high-high-high-high (I get high)
I get high-high-high-high (All the time)
I get high-high-high-high (Bring me mines)
I get high-high-high-high (Bring the scale)
I get high-high-high-high (This shit is some killa)
I get high-high-high-high (I need a zip, that's fat as a whale)
I get high-high-high-high (I get high)
I get high-ighhhhhhh

[Verse]
I get high, I need that OG
Off the OG, better no nigga approach me
I smoke swishers to the face, I don't smoke with the gang
You smoke that boogus, boy, won't you stay up in your lane
I need a zip that look just like a whale
Give me my key, now where my fucking scale?
Just like the cartel I can't go to jail
And just like Jesus I can't go to hell
That opp pack, it be reeking on a nigga
That block pack, it be creeping on a nigga
Get three stacks, what you want, beefing off a nigga
This 93 Octane, no Keef on us lil nigga

[Hook]
I get high-high-high-high (I get high)
I get high-high-high-high (All the time)
I get high-high-high-high (Bring me mines)
I get high-high-high-high (Bring the scale)
I get high-high-high-high (This shit is some killa)
I get high-high-high-high (I need a zip, that's fat as a whale)
I get high-high-high-high (I get high)
I get high-ighhhhhhh

High-high-high-high
I get high-high-high-high
I get high-high-high-high
I get high-ighhhhhhh
