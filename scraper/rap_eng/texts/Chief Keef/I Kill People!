[Intro: Tadoe]
Ayy, what's poppin'?
You know how the fuck we bleed, man
We get money and kill people, man
You hear me, man?
We don't rap beef, man
We slide, man, we drill people, man
Bummin' like Obama do and in traffic with a gun or two, man
I only speak facts and count racks, man, and send packs, man
Let's get it

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill boy, yeah
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill boy
Foenem tweaking, we gon' show his ass for real boy, yeah
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bus' him up, yeah
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bus' him up (ay)
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bus' him up

[Verse 1: Tadoe]
Tote somethin' illegal
Hit your block with them guys, hop out, kill people
Got a Glock four-five, and it's real lethal (let's get it)
Bitch, you know we fry, we really kill people (bang bang)
Bitch, I'm with the gang, we catch a body gang (gang gang)
Bitch, we gang bang off in the lobby man (bang)
Catch a nigga lackin', it's a hobby man
Pop him in the noggin, leave him sloppy man
Hit your block, we gon' swerve shit (skrt skrt)
In the trap, I'm posted with the birds, bitch (skrt skrt)
I don't rap beef, what's the words, bitch? (huh?)
Niggas sneak dissin', let me hurt 'em (bang bang)

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill boy, yeah
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill boy
Foenem tweaking, we gon' show his ass for real boy, yeah
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bus' him up, yeah
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bus' him up (ay)
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bus' him up

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Everyone same side for lil bro, Ice Age all on my throat
How I ball, you think I went pro, I'm in the hood, Brisco
She show me her thong, Sisq√≥, she's hot and ready to go
I'm hungrier than a hippo, Aim that thing high, get low
Got a new scope and it got zoom, and I'm in that yoom
Baby, I know you smell that fume
Just get down, you hear that boom
In the back of the 'Bach, and this bitch got room
Magazine got colored shells, half green, half blue
Smoking on that cook', someone bring me a pot
All these diamonds, I don't get hot
Young nigga really from them blocks
Ayy pussy, here we come, if you ready or not
On probation but I tote Glocks
Walk through court, smellin' like pot

[Chorus: Trippie Redd]
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill boy, yeah
Shawty know I kill people, real people
From the trenches where it's real lethal, tote real regals
Big body, what's your build boy? Ill boy
Nigga need to find his chill boy
Foenem tweaking, we gon' show his ass for real boy, yeah
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bus' him up, yeah
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bus' him up (ay)
Foenem tweaking, I'ma bus' him up
