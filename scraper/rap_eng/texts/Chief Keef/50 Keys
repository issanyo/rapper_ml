[Hook: Chief Keef & Lil Flash]
I be smoking out them pounds with no seeds
'Member when I was pushin' 50 keys
Ain't never like them fucked up police
What the fuck is they gon' do for me?
I'm super high, I think I might OD
For a feature now I need like 50 keys
I'm blowin' all this OG, I can't breathe
Glo Gang, we ball out like we in the league

[Verse 1: Lil Flash]
Savages poppin' out the cut, they movin' through trees
Serve his ass that food, that's apple bees
I got Air Force shooters on my team, they rockin' with me
Air Forces Ones on my feet, yo kicks look beat
I like yo bitch that look better when she on her knees
Finesse, finesse, I gotta eat, it's gone be a feast
Fuck boy saying that he want the beef
We gone slide up on his block with the macaroni
This P-I-S-T-O-L right by the double G's
I'ma pull up and blow out that energy
I'm sippin' on this weed and smoking this lean
You dreamin' off the drink and coughing up green
Remember when I went from Chiraq to overseas?
Yo bitch be all op the top and she T-O-P
M-G-E-T-T-I and a few G-L-O-C-K
I'ma from Chiraq, I ain't from the fucking bay or LA
