Snippet

[Intro]
Oh he just hopped up out the old one
You see, yall want me show y'all
Come out with that throwaway and dispose y'all
High tops and Uzis like I'm O-Dog
Catch me smoking on this potent
Loud should be my slogan
Put 100 on a nigga, that should be my token
Got (?) on your bitch and that can be her lotion
When I hop out that skrt make sure them cameras is on focus

[Hook]
Got these bands flying like a falcon
There are landmines all around me
Smoke so much dope it's fogging mountains
After a couple shows we all be counting
We gon' ball, relentlessly
I'm flexing on my ex and my enemies
Balling, you can't walk if you don't crawl, skrt
Pillows, oh the heaters hopped up out the oh lord

[Hook]
Got these bands flying like a falcon

After a couple shows we all be counting

I'm flexing on my ex and my enemies
Balling, you can't walk if you don't crawl, skrt
Pillows, oh the heaters hopped up out the oh lord
