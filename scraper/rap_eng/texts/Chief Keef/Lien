[Intro: Chief Keef]
She say she love me but I know she lien
She only love me 'cause I got that shine
Shine

[Hook: Chief Keef]
She say she love me but I know she lien
She only love me 'cause I got that shine
Why you lien, baby? You's a dime
You so hot that I think it's a crime
You say you love me but I know
And I wanna see where we gon' go
And I heard that you's a lil hoe
You say you not, girl, whatcha lien for?
Quit lien

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Why you lien, girl?
Why you be lien all the time, girl? Aye
Make up your mind, girl, aye
Get you some money, girl
You like a black girl, aye
Get off my line, girl
Smoking on kush, girl
Smoking weed in Holly with the wood, girl
Saying you's a good girl
But I ain't ask if you was, girl
My pockets on my [?]
[?]
Steady saying that you not thot, I can't imagine, girl
Girl you lien, what you lien to me for?
You don't owe me, no lie, but you owe me coochie though
Say you're mine but I already know
I know you's a badass, you on your Boosie flow

[Hook: Chief Keef]
She say she love me but I know she lien
She only love me 'cause I got that shine
Why you lien, baby? You's a dime
You so hot that I think it's a crime
You say you love me but I know
And I wanna see where we gon' go
And I heard that you's a lil hoe
You say you not, girl, whatcha lien for?
Quit lien

[Verse 2: Tadoe & Chief Keef]
Girl you fine as wine, girl
I swear you always on my mind, girl
But I don't have no time, girl
I promise I'm not lien, girl
I ain't lien
Shots flying
My money steady multiplying

Tadoe, what's that? Bitches lien
Girl you know I leave you tearing
She like, "You stay disappearing"
All you wanna do is get head
She like you ain't listening to none of this that

[Hook: Chief Keef]
She say she love me but I know she lien
She only love me 'cause I got that shine
Why you lien, baby? You's a dime
You so hot that I think it's a crime
You say you love me but I know
And I wanna see where we gon' go
And I heard that you's a lil hoe
You say you not, girl, whatcha lien for?
Quit lien
