[Chorus:]
I'm sipping on this drink, it tastes like candy
I pull up, I got on a cool twenty
Watch I turn a bitch head, just like Timmy
She got a Neutron head, just like Jimmy
Tell that bitch get out my laboratory, Dee-Dee
I'm fresh look like I'm bout to hit a fefe
She say she don't smoke, then watch me get tree-tree
Look at my chain, and you see them s's, VV

[Verse 1]
Look at them VVS'
Look at the lean, he stretched it
You smoking fu, not dope, watch you need, weed lessons
Was with Sasha and Tasha when I got Keke message
I play these hoes the other way, call me Chief Keef Hendrix
All these thots, they gave me top, like that's Chief Keef misses
Pulled out the Glock, like this Chief Keef misses
Gone try to tell me something but will Chief Keef listen?
My watch [?] your thot, pussy boy, your Chief Keef [?]
She seen my car, and she let Chief Keef hit
Right over the head, she let Chief Keef split
I ain't need nothing but a sweet three minutes
A hoe can't get all of me, don't call me Chief Keef Legend

[Chorus:]
I'm sipping on this drink, it tastes like candy
I pull up, I got on a cool twenty
Watch I turn a bitch head, just like Timmy
She got a Neutron head, just like Jimmy
Tell that bitch get out my laboratory, Dee-Dee
I'm fresh look like I'm bout to hit a fefe
She say she don't smoke, then watch me get tree-tree
Look at my chain, and you see them s's, VV

[Verse 2:]
I'm in that photo but no flash, freshest in the class
Don't need no hall pass, I'm not headed to class
I'm smoking on gas, car made out glass
You ain't first boy you last, if you can't touch the grass
At the mall spending bands, they like come back again
Say they party need GLO, I'll bring some captain in
My car so good like Meghan, cause it think like a man
I whip the union like Gabrielle, want to fuck Taraji
I'm out of time with the clan, Margiela's in sand
Dirty Sprites and Fantas, tell your bitch come again
She say she coming in, I say dick going out
If I let her keep her phone, it's like I gave her come clout

[Chorus:]
I'm sipping on this drink, it tastes like candy
I pull up, I got on a cool twenty
Watch I turn a bitch head, just like Timmy
She got a Neutron head, just like Jimmy
Tell that bitch get out my laboratory, Dee-Dee
I'm fresh look like I'm bout to hit a fefe
She say she don't smoke, then watch me get tree-tree
Look at my chain, and you see them s's, VV
