[Intro]
I love the Private Club
DJ on the beat, so it's a banger

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Louboutin, she want Christian Louboutins
Bad bitch, wanna hit the movies, huh?
X pill got her feelin' groovy, huh
All my diamonds on in jacuzzi, huh (Huh)
Louboutin, she want Christian Louboutins
Bad bitch, wanna hit the movies, huh
X pill got her feelin' groovy, huh
All my diamonds on in a jacuzzi, huh (Huh)

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
You didn't think that I would press you, huh?
You ain't think that you would feel the pressure, huh?
You ain't think that I'd teach a lesson, huh?
You ain't think that Twenty really dressin', huh?
20, 40, 50, 60 sessions, huh?
Told Count just add compression, huh
You ain't think that I know you fake, huh?
You ain't think I know what this would take, huh?
You don't call me Rizzy, not my day one
You thought you knew me but I'm not the same one

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Louboutin, she want Christian Louboutins
Bad bitch, wanna hit the movies, huh?
X pill got her feelin' groovy, huh
All my diamonds on in jacuzzi, huh (Huh)
Louboutin, she want Christian Louboutins
Bad bitch, wanna hit the movies, huh
X pill got her feelin' groovy, huh
All my diamonds on in a jacuzzi, huh (Huh)

[Verse 2: Chief Keef]
Talk, baby, it's me, baby
Spaceship, you see me in a spaceship (Spaceship)
Day shift, she hit work on the day shift (Goddamn)
Them ain't real hundreds, baby, them fake strips (They fugazi)
Gettin' dome from a bitch with fake lips (Uh, uh)
You want a evening, I can feed you, carry clips
And the car pull off like I'm pulled by eight deers
And I ain't fuckin' with these niggas 'cause they weird (Hell yeah)
And I ain't really takin' these fuck niggas serious (On God)
I see a real nigga every time I look in the mirror
I flame that loud and I said, "Baby, cover your ears"
Now this ain't soul food, but I can get all up in your ribs
She like, "Sosa, baby, love when you sayin' your ad-libs" (Talk, baby, it's me, baby)
I told her, "You like to talk, huh? You wanna wear my ice, huh?
You want that new LV, yeah? You want that new bling bling, uh?
You want me to make you scream, huh? R&B, make you sing, huh?
You want me to stay off the lean, huh? Wanna get off a bean, huh?"

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Louboutin, she want Christian Louboutins
Bad bitch, wanna hit the movies, huh?
X pill got her feelin' groovy, huh
All my diamonds on in jacuzzi, huh (Huh)
Louboutin, she want Christian Louboutins
Bad bitch, wanna hit the movies, huh
X pill got her feelin' groovy, huh
All my diamonds on in a jacuzzi, huh (Huh)
