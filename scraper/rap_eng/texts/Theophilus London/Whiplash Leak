Whiplash, whiplahs, whiplash, whiplash

I can peep it in your style lil theo huh
Now they looking like they seen the ghost
When they know its my vibe they need the most
They need you around

Put the car in the c star
When the heat start lurking
B star burning

Heads in the future but your necks in the past (all of the damned)

Big big smoke, im eating all yall dinners
Tell big peppers im getting warm this winter
Big bonds big rocks im getting all ??

[Refrain]
I see you
I see you outside with the up and down
You realise you ??
Walking outside like the 4th of july
Looking like its labour day in brooklyn
I see you too acting like theo 2013
With the chelsea boots on
