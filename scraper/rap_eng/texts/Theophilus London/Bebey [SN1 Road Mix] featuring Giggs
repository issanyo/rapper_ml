[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Breaking the evening, off
Catching a nice breeze thru the day line
Singing in my mind it's the way life goes
Ain't cutting a man slack imma take mine
The love is alright and the grace shall show
Sun down I'll meet you by the sea line
I'll whip it off ya top while ya braid my hairrrrr
Braid my hairrrrr

[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Baby you on top of me
Fills my heart times three
I'm flawed in ectasyyy
Baby you on top of me
Fills my heart times three
I'm flawed in ectasyyy

[Verse 2: Giggs]
I just, pull up just down the road
Drop off the princess
You know just how we roll, I get the interest
Taking them sisters home, and it ain't incest
Holla back in the zone
Back in my kings nest
You know just how it goes
I'm at my kings desk
Got the boy on the phone
He has the ting set
You know about the throne
I took the king steps
In and just out the zone
And then my ting texts (jheez)
Ten percenting
You know where I'm reppin'
Coz i'm representing (yeah)
Make that shorty jumpin' as I pump the engine
You know holla man i get that happy ending (ummm!)
Can't you see me shopping yeah i'm happy spending
First they see me bond street then it's back to kensing
Got these niggas shook
I got em' back pretending (yeah yeah)
Man is so emotional I'm back offending (haha)

[Verse 3: Theophilus London]
This is your father boy
Yeah I'm feeling like a new me
Yeah I'm feeling like a new me

Yeah I'm feeling like a new me
I hop on the next flight to Soweto
Man pull up dat ting
Them woman's flapping man with them hot panties, chilling in the air
That ting hot man
Yeah I'm feeling like a new me
Yeah I'm feeling like a new me
- - I'm feeling like a
Yeah I'm feeling like a
I hop on the next flight to Soweto
These two girls they sat right behind my chair
Dear god, I thank you for the double
Bismillah you know jeans Dior
Oh lord she move to the baseline
And her top lineeee it make her waist line
Goooooo it make her waist line goooo

[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Baby you on top of me
Fills my heart times three
I'm flawed in ectasyyy
Baby you on top of me
Fills my heart times three
I'm flawed in ectasyyy

[Verse 4: Theophilus London]
Watch how she grooves to the baseline
It make her west line gooooo
It make her west line gooooo
Baby babe gave u all my trust
I done paved the way to make all this such
I love u more, do you love me more?
I'm waiting and waiting to get off this tour
Baby babe as we take our hearts
Learn to pray as we make this start
Lonely sins they come out the dark
Love will wash them off

[Outro]
Breaking the evening, off

Fills my heart times three
