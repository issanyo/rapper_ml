[Verse 1 - Theophilus]
Uh, uh
Smooth Lover
Whom other knew color, cool brother
Two summers grew, numbers flew under
Few bummers, newcomers lose some of their art
Their heart, ain't just in it
I depart in it, start gimmicks, smart idiots
I depart in a minute, like the lies and the cheat that caught with the sinnin

I'mma be raw me, raw be then all 3
Score on me, he foresee
The light that shed, make water make bread at hand
My man, not my nigga but you're my fam, get it
We cousins or brothers, something from colors, energy in all sorts
Jungles, bookbag is in all ports
Sit, sit down on my porch

The ball's my court, all in
You're thin, not in or ready for the in crowd
Scream it out loud, I'm black and I'm proud
Not race I mean space I mean faith I mean grace
Amaze ones

[Hook x4]
So sit there and enjoy the sun
I just love everyone
Baby I'm glad you come and
Dance with me

Stalagtite, stalagtite
Stalagtite drum

[Hook]

Sleepless nights, teach us fright
We do whatever you say
You say kill, we go kill
And wait until the sky goes grey
Most of the villagers never make it out
They're still stuck in they caves
And one out of many will climb to the top
I guess I must have been brave!

[Hook]
