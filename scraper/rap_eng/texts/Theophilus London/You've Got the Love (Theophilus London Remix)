You got it, you got it
You got it, oh you got it

[Theophilus London]

I think it's safe to say I'm in your heart and you can't get me out
The city streets, I scream my name, I think we took this route
But déjà vu, you say "I do", oh maybe I've gone too far
But neither less, let's take it slow, leave faith behind the stars
You know me best, how many years?
One or three? how many tears?
Three or four?
And those were just makes no joy, sticks (sticks)
You play that game, you play it well
I just touched down, no NFL
The heath throw it properly
They say my passport look like a property (uh)
Mister London, welcome
Missus London, welcome
If you see something, help uh
If you see something, help 'em
Oops got a dream I woke up
In about one week that we broke up
That means no sleep, no meals, no cars, no fills, no deal

[Hook; The XX]

Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I could count on you
Sometimes I just feel like saying "Lord, I just don't care"
You've got the love I need to see me through

[Hook; The XX]

Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through

(hey! ho!) When food is gone you are my daily meal
When friends are gone I know my saviour's love is real
Your love is real

You've got the love (you got it)
You've got the love (oh you got it)
You've got the love (uh)
You've got the love (you got it)
You've got the love (oh you got it)
You've got the love
You've got the love (you got it)
You've got the love (oh you got it)
You've got the love (uh)
You've got the love (you got it)
You've got the love (oh you got it)
You've got the love (ho!)
You've got the love (you got it)
You've got the love (oh you got it)
You've got the love (hey! ho!)
You've got the love (you got it)
You've got the love (oh you got it)
You've got the love (-oveee You know!... )
