[Hook]
(Sample of Michael Jackson's "Baby Be Mine")
YSL, the best of the best things
YSL, the best of the best things
500 Bentley, 500 Bentley

[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
I got all these gold chains, call me Mr. T
All these girls praying to me like epiphanies
Might lick you in the morning, fuck you in the evening
Kiss you when I’m leaving, the gold grills beamin’
Hoes call me Theo, but I ain’t their uncle
Fuck her to my mixtapes, and now I want you
She said my favorite song is the Oops cover
She wants to get her swag on with real lovers
Vinny Cha$e got his cup all drawn up
Every club, every venue – tore it up
Keep the champagne flowin, baby pour it up
Bring more sparklies, I’m ragin’ like Barkley
Rest in peace to the jheri curl Mike Jack
I do my dance so tight, I know you like that
Trapped in the matrix, drinking that lean
Cheers club and the lovers, we’re the team

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse 2: Vinny Cha$e]
The more I smoke, the smaller the blunt gets
A whole crew of niggas who be fly and who run shit
Who want this, I’ll give it to anybody who fly
And anybody who ride five-hundreds
Chick with me, she nice, she ride, she like, she love money
When I get pulled over she hides the drugs for me
I want her in my arms, I like, I love that
See the sky, take a look at the stars, I does that
YSL, the best of the best things
Five hundred Bentley, the best whip I stepped in
Guest list, skip that, we be in the marquee
Poppin bottles and models and big stacks
All types of shades, but these be Carrera
To match the Carrera Porsche Panamera
I see a winner when I’m staring in the mirror
When a chicks staring at me I swear I’ma get her
I’m wearing a leather, my chick’s bag Burkin
A 100k cash for a bag, was it worth it
Nervous, shakey, more money more problems
More problems, I get more cakey

[Hook - 2x]

[Verse 3: Vinny Cha$e]
I upgrade ya from BCBG
To 5 star hotel drinks and weed leaves
I know dudes who is white collar criminals
Who hold dice games twenty thousand dollar minimums
Getting em, see, me and money got a friendship
A nigga get fly, so fly its offensive
Bentley, I ain’t gonna front, I ain’t cop yet
The money that I got, Vinny spent it on watches
