[Verse One]
She smelled like cigarettes
And her voice was partly dirty
I can smell the Vodka in her breath
And I plead her beg for mercy
And midnight struck
And when she barfs she coughs just to alert me
Mascara melting down her face and her grip stockings are flirty
And her tattoo's and hair do's will have you on a journey
And in fact you will have to buy a house in Jersey
She knows where she's from, She knows what she wants
You ain't got to front, You should pack a blunt
This will happen once

[Hook: 4x]
You and me and he
A short ride to three
Stop rewind and lets go again T-N-T on me

[Verse Two]
Committing Suicide, don't try this at home
This is grown this is flown
From here to there
You are everywhere
Lose your underwear
And lets just say goodnight
And depart, shameless promotion
My fangs got you open
Open toes that is
Cause if your feet ain't right I dispose that is
Those ain't ribs girl
See that's steak not beefing
Cause I ain't no rapper you ain't no gangster
So leave it my Jesus
I said it in vain
I say how hers came
I killed able, I met a girl named Sable
And she was a Dinosaur
Girl you are my Dinosaur
Yea, I make your legs sore you my legs sore
We make our legs sore
(Tell em)

[Hook: 4x]
You and me and he
A short ride to three
Stop rewind and lets go again, T-N-T on me
