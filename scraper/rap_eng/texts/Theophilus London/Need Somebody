[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Close your eyes and let it go
Drop and yank the tidal rope
We've seen so many places, we've seen so many graces
Hit you three times in a row, strike 'em out like a pro
It's time to bring the action, it's time to bring the mack out
These girls are social climbers, they'll climb and blow your back out
Leave your bags by the door
Make sweet lovin' on the floor
Hit me 2 now hit the 4
If you don't know, now you know

[Chorus: Theophilus London]
Girl, you're gonna need somebody
Who can show you the ways to go
Show you all my love and my devotion
Just give me your hand to hold
Girl, you're gonna need somebody
Who can show you the ways to go
I wanna be your only lover
Just give me your hand to hold

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
I really need to change up (Oh my God what am I gonna wear?)
But I can't make my mind up
All they see is dollar signs, they view you like a trophy
The buzz is runnin' out, they want to ball like Kobe
Every day it comes and goes, got the shove, predict the pull
Got the covers, got the heart, had the brains from the start

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Leon Ware]
Hold, hold my hand (x8)

[Chorus]
