Oh, oh, starry eyed
Hit, hit, hit, hit, hit me with lightning

Handle bars, and then I let go, let go for anyone
Take me in, and throw out my heart and get a new one
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

So we burst into colors, colors and carousels
Fall head first, like paper planes and playground games
Next thing, we're touching
You look at me, it's like you hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching
Next thing, we're touching

Hit me with lightning

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes

Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And everybody knows
Oh, everybody's starry eyed
And my body goes
