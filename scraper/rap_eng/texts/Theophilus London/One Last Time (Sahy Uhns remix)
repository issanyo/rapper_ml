Gone until the early evenin', search for her, a voice inside
That I've been yearnin' for your love, if there's a way to catch you
Through the air waves, to change your mind
Tonight I hope you hear me callin' one last time, hey

Everybody is somebody's baby
Until the point till you drive me crazy
And no answer, no phone, I'm not home
Drop everythin', headed over to Stockholm

You dealt with your fears, hide the truth
The out lookin' in, ignited the fuse
The words you made emerge
Leadin' on a verse to a path you should deserve

People around town tell me words, it's absurd
Now I got a light in the dark, I'm at the curve
Lookin' for my love like you're mighty but only hurt
Never face to face but it's time we make it work, make it work

Hold up, got stories to tell
Someone pack us in smile, have recorded the mail, the mail
My love, my love, see you next time
Just know, never forget mine, hey

Gone until the early evenin', search for her, a voice inside
That I've been yearnin' for your love, if there's a way to catch you
Through the air waves, to change your mind
Tonight I hope you hear me callin' one last time, hey

Talk to me, I need you now
Sing to me and soothe my ail
See it was all giggles when you was here
And now the snapshot, is it shoe for nail?

You the queen bee on some love kim shit
Let's fly away, handle our business
My best bud and my hug bug
And now you know I've got bitten by a love bug

And when you're dancin', shake that curly hair
Strange takin' back to the early years
Had a skin tick, I was lookin' for a clue
I'm checkin' in, ask the clerk if he saw you

And on some young shit, hum drum dumb shit
Skyline great, got my body on some numb shit
If not now, guess I'll see you next time
Just know, never forget mine, hey

Gone until the early evenin', search for her, a voice inside
That I've been yearnin' for your love, if there's a way to catch you
Through the air waves, to change your mind
Tonight I hope you hear me callin' one last time, hey

Gone until the early evenin', search for her, a voice inside
That I've been yearnin' for your love, if there's a way to catch you
Through the air waves, to change your mind
