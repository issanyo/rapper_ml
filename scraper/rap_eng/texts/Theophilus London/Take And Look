I want to live like a breath to you
Let me out and do positive
All I want is to dance, electric lights
Let me see your body
I want to swim also, honey

I'm like a [?] after a [?]
Let me hear, send a fare, but not under the palm tree
They may have lost it

Ramabama
Ramabama
Ramabama
Ramabama

All I want is to rock your jolly hips
I do, it's still erotic
I do, it's still erotic

(Let's cruise and look around)
