[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
The race is on, baby, yeah
For just how long?
They attack, they defend, baby, woah
To reach the end

[Chorus]
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

[Verse 2]
They race to the top, yeah
Until they drop, ohh
And they take all the pain
Is it all in vein?

[Chorus]
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

[Verse 3]
They've lost their minds (lost their fucking minds)
And they seek to find, ooh
The very top of the hill, ooh
And some of them will

[Chorus]
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

[Outro]
They've lost their mind, woah
They seek to find
They've lost their mind, woah
They seek to find
