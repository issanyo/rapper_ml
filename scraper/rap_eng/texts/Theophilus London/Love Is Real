[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
I fell in love with a disco queen
In the heart of the city at a bistro scene
A long story short, chick kind of lost, turned to the house that I bought
We took a trip down Mexico, I nearly shot myself like Plaxico
But with a mouth so fire she was technical
And don’t turn into a vegetable , hey

[Hook: Holly Miranda]
You walk to the sun, I sleep through the day
But nothing more
The sky lit up the stars, a million miles apart
To get where you are
Is that what you want, cause love is real
Just look at the times
Is that what you want, cause love is real
Just look at the times

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
Catch rest in the motel room
When the roosters call I escape this doom
The humming bird meets the humming man
Six years later you will understand
I spoke 4 words with her last night, night, yikes
The motherland for another life or another man, damn

[Hook: Holly Miranda]
You walk to the sun, I sleep through the day
But nothing more
The sky lit up the stars, a million miles apart
To get where you are
Is that what you want, cause love is real
Just look at the times
Is that what you want, cause love is real
Just look at the times

[Verse 3: Theophilus London]
Try and make the most of this
Don’t throw it all away
She had to change her number twice
And no time to count the days
She a disco queen, party all night like her shit’s so clean
If you meet those eyes, it might be me in a deep disguise

[Hook: Holly Miranda]
You walk to the sun, I sleep through the day
But nothing more
The sky lit up the stars, a million miles apart
To get where you are
Is that what you want, cause love is real
Just look at the times
Is that what you want, cause love is real
Just look at the times

You walk to the show, I sleep through the day
But nothing more
The sky lit up the stars, a million miles apart
To get where you are
Is that what you want, cause love is real
Just look at the times
Is that what you want, cause love is real
Just look at the times
Is that what you want, cause love is real
Just look at the times
Is that what you want, cause love is real
