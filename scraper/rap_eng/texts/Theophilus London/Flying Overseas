[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Mr. Taxi Man
It's been along time, I'll be back again
The birds and the bees be attracting them
The pretty little flowers on the racks a'blend
Fulfilled with meaning, let's sip the Riesling
I'm thinking about white to match the season
Let's visit the gardens, the rivered parks
I'll bring it to your eyes, delivered hearts

[Bridge: Devonte Hynes]
Do you remember me
Do you remember me
Ms. Hilary
Do you remember me

[Hook: Solange Knowles]
I'm going overseas
Come fly with me, I'll give you all
I'm going overseas
Come fly with me, I'll give you all

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
When I'm overseas, your love just come over me
Attacking me viciously in a sweet way that's loving to me
Gifts and diamond rings, a car, that's nothing to me
You send a picture, a mail package, that's something to me
Have a cup of my tea
All the suckers should leave
Baby, I'm no sucker, I'm free
Age is numbers to me
You send a picture, I send a picture, that's comforting me
A star gets lonely at night
Only if moments are bright
We just can't get enough of us
This is our night
The moon is saying something to us
At all times bright
Her eyes said it all, lips are the softest
Let's go in the wind and get driven by the forces
Let's lay in the wind and get driven by the forces

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Break: Theophilus London, Devonte Hynes & Solange Knowles]
I ache for you, this heart of mine
Don't be afraid to crack a smile, my dear
Ohh she said to me, what a tragedy
Live happily in life throughout the years (x2)

[Hook]
