[Verse 1]
And this here is my destiny
And if I fail motherfuckers it's death for me
Last night, evil stole my heart but somehow I feel it resurrecting me
So don't stop now keep testing me
And you can talk your shit but have a check for me
And if your whole team feel I don't deserve to damn pop
Tell them they can get off my Herbie Hancock
It's what a fresh breath could be
And if you don't know I tell you what's next for me, for me
From the bird's view, from the third view
In the sky without no curfew
From the bird's view, in the sky without no curfew
I know you've been waiting for the thunder
Let's give them the Indian summer

[Hook]
Last name London, first name Theophilus, Theophilus, Theopilus
Last name London, first name Theophilus, Theophilus, Theopilus
Last name London, first name Theophilus, Theophilus, Theopilus
Last name London, first name Theophilus, Theophilus, Theopilus

[Verse 2]
People back to calling me Kapps, like when you gonna drop that new shit
Home boy it's Theophilus the surname well known don't take me for a fool shit
Pick, pick up the phone
It's a girl trying to interview speakin' my cool shit
Is she coming over, fifty fifty win no huh takin' no Ja Rule shit
Oh shit, the whole city covered in white, she discovered the light
Yeah, she get naked on Skype and now she wear my Nike, airs
I ain't gon' bow down to no mami
Want me to say I'll do, that's cold hymen
I don't battle, I pro rhyme
G-g-get with the program

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
And this here black excellence
It's a nation of bloom black wrestlin'
I give them the elbow like Dwayne Johnson
I'm on Elizabeth like C Ronson
I'm with a rap chick and 'fe Dobson who got her hair red like D. Rodman
Can't stop now, Homie keep boppin'
You a day one fan nigga keep rockin'
Rap terrorist Funk Flex shit
So cops shummyshummy for the next trip
We Velvet blaze on some next shit
They call me flavor cause I rep shit

PoPo in the back we wrap shit
Super rap savior
Do me a favor, keep getting your paper

[Hook]
