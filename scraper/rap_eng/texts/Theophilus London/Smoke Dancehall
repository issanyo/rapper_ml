[Verse 1]
I met this girl named Shirley
And every day she fin' wake up early
To be my sunshine (my sunshine)
She'd take a spin in me bimmer
So she could link up me cousin Karima
And see me and Fox mash up arenas
Girl you're right on time

[Pre-Chorus]
Come in here sweet thing, girl you're hot
I know you want me, baby
It's not hard to please me, love me up
You know I want you, baby
Come in here sweet thing, girl you're hot
You know you want me, baby
It's not hard to please me, love me up
You know you want you, baby

[Chorus]
In the hall, hall
Tell 'em that you want me baby
In the hall, hall
Girl I know you want me, baby

[Verse 2]
Show up to your party, girl, like a top dawta
Top dollar, worldwide, top rapper
Talk to the princess on the top yachta
Block, blocka, all haters kick soccer
Get your information by lil' killer
Ring, ring on each finger, bounty killer
911, you can call my blow dealer
Top model, D'Amato, go gaga
I ain't tryna school you, just spittin' game
Make my country proud every time they hear my name
New York bad boy, Trinny to the bone
We don't fuck around, you can hear it in my tone
Say every good girl want a bad boy
Who only gon' be good to her
And they say every bad boy want a good girl
Who only gon' be bad for him


[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Outro] x2
You make me love like I'm the one
And it feels right to be yours
And in the morning when you smile
And your eyes meet mine
