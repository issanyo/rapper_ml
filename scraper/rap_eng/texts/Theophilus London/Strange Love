Uh oh., uh oh., uh oh., uh oh... Oh oh. ( Continues )
Oh my how time goes fast but not on a lonely night
His way is off to the west yes to catch his flight
Her bedroom was painted red to sleep through the nights
Is something cold in the air, something just don't feel right
Oh well god damn, oh man, chicka ah.! Chicka ow ow
Oh ma how nice of you to disregard all I do, do
Sing sex songs, love is in the house this ain't the fool do
Saying it's a visitor, I'm saying It's a visitor
Strange love, strange misery
Strange days are definitely coming upon me
Strange hearts beat so strangely
Was I right, Was I wrong, Was it you all along
( Love is strange )
A Girl went to Africa, said two demons were after her. ( her )
And I don't like harassing her, so I took a breathe without asking her. ( her )
I took a good laugh with her, left flowers in the bed & bath for her
With a note I resumed a massacre. Took, took right off after her. ( her )
A fall approaches, something starts to reek for soldiers
I can smell the sex as we cross over
Sweet loves Bliss rocky bolders
We smash fists then brush shoulders
She's my gift, I'm vise versa
The more she gives we get closer
I don't read minds I read hearts
Strange love, strange misery
Strange days are definitely coming upon me
Strange hearts beat so strangely
Was I right, Was I wrong, Was it you all along
( Love is strange )
Six days, five months, we searched but no luck
No den and no lunch, it's funny how something's don't mean much
The pic's in my phone, hotel says your not home
And she leaves me to just Rome, on that day without knowing
Who you are, who you are, felt a lil looser
But do I have to stalk you.?
Hey, you know some guy named mark ???
Who flew from the sky to reincart you??
In the basement and he brought you
The floors down, I'm in court now.??
I'm yours now, I'm yours now
Strange love, strange misery
Strange days are definitely coming upon me
Strange hearts beat so strangely
Was I right, Was I wrong, Was it you all along
( Love is strange )
