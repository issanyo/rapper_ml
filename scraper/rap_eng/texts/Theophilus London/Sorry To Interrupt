[Verse 1]
There ain't enough love in the world right now to fill my cup
You can put the charming beyond, but I'm still getting people warmed up
The cookies warm, put your slippers on, turn the movie on, and sing my song
The eyes behind my scat game, I came to interrupt
Your scheduled programs, your hectic romance is getting blown up
This is the feel-good, real-good shit you hear right when you first wake up
She called me a good hugger, I called her a good lover
The penny loafs, the shoulder pads, can I show up?

[Bridge]
All night I've been trying to tell you, the secret I can't ignore
So many reasons I want to hold you, but the time I can't afford

[Hook]
Hey! I'm feeling awful fine, I'm trying to lose some time
And get you off my mind
I'm standing in this line with a couple friends of mine
I take it as a sign, it's time that you should shine
Hey! I'm feeling awful fine, I'm trying to lose some time
And get you off my mind
I'm standing in this line with a couple friends of mine
I take it as a sign, it's time to make shit shine

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Stay young, get active baby, the young can't get hoked up
I know you visit clubs with your fake id and we get stoked up
You got your curly hair, your black underwear, I know you're feeling grown up
You smoke your cigarette, are you finished, yes?
Sorry to interrupt
There ain't enough love in the world right now to fill my cup, cup
Ain't enough love in the world right now to fill my cup, cup
She called me a good hugger, I called her a good lover
The penny loafs, the shoulder pads, can I show up?
