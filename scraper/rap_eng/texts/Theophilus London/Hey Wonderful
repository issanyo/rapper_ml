[Verse 1]
Ah Chichiuhuhuh
When the night crawls down and creep
Catville ah you can call my town
Creep Creep Creep, No fleet we steep
2 flights 1 jeep, 4 nights no sleep uh
I think I ran into Manute Bol and Mutombo, in a bar once
And she rambled on how she met a star once
And he dashed her, for the car stunt
A U turn, like 5 months
Like ears change, you fear change
You ears strange, my bare game
I had to do foul fair change
I'm back on my English shit
They like, "Hey when you back on your English trip?"
I'm like, "Hey Hey, you and my babe bay, plus my business go and make play play"
You can make pay pay and it comes that day, when you shake my head
And my eye view straight, uh
Sawali talked about world peace, from London to New York
All cease, I like to read with you
I like to talk to you, I like to hold your hand
I like to walk with you, This Emotion music if need be
I got 2 words, "HEY STEVIE!"

[Stevie Wonder - Love Light In Flight]
Makes me feel like Paradise
Give me what I'm missing
Send me to the highest heights
Take me up and away

I've tasted Love so many times
With something always missing
But I know that you got the kind
To take me up and away
