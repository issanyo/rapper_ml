[Intro: Theophilus London & Lana Del Rey]
(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh
Uh oh, uh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
(Uh, this love is dead)

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
You always buy me roses when I’m mad
Do you think I’ll forgive you just like that?
Did you forget who you were seeing, yeah?
I’m not letting you off easy, I’m still sad

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
I’m kissing you hard, you got my lipstick on your face
I stole your girlfriend’s keys, kicked her out of your place
Cause I want you more than I did before, -fore
I’m missing you hard, give you my softcore babyface
And then we start to fight, tumble down the staircase
And when we hit that floor, you want me even more, more

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
You always buy me roses like a creep
Asking for forgiveness, unsexy
What happened to the man you used to be?
If you still want my love then work for me

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey & Theophilus London ]
You’re kissing me hard, you got my lipstick on your face
You show me what you got and put a girl in her place
If you want me more than you did before
(Uh, feeling's gone, feeling's gone)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright

[Verse 3: Theophilus London ]
We had conversations, ain’t nothing said
This girl is crazy, I've done lost my head
"Her life is awesome", the doctor said
But my shit feel awful, this love is dead

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright
And then you buy me roses and it’s fine
I forgive you almost all the time
As long as you remember that you’re mine
I’ll let you off easy, it’s alright

[Outro: Theophilus London ]
See I could see the pain
In her eyes, in her eyes
This love is dead
This love is dead
