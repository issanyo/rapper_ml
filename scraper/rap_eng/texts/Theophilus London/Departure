[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Hello Ma'am
I'm present in your presence I feel
It's time I depart in your soul see
I'm a flower that was built by the man
Or the woman that I fair
He she resides up there and
Time is so irrelevant
Conspire it's a line finds a design
A creature so benevolent
Your soul fuses a fume of desire
That senses my senses
Trigger blend so tremendous and
The world that I reside in
Sometimes Im hiding, so makes dividing
Nights are unwinding
Pleasure that I thought I once knew
Huh. It never grew

[Hook]
Once again it's time to Depart (4x)

Alright so get focused
Beautiful women of America here it goes

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
Talk to me baby I am lost for words
But this is something new, I am often heard
[Girl speaks]
Oh, thats your real name? I thought you were called the second?
[Theophilus returns]
Word? On the earth I am called the 3rd
Theophilus London power ensured
But enough about me see its about you
And how much we grew and what's true
Huh. Is true...

[Verse 3: Jesse Boykins]
Baby! Just sit right there
Don't go no where
I've got somethings to show you
Just be well prepared
Baby! Take my time
Just put your faith in me
When I'm around you
Oh Baby!

[Hook]
Once again it's time to Depart(4x)
[Theophilus sings in between Hook]
Take me outa here Im finished girl
I don't wanna go right now
[Jesse Boykins sing in between Hook after Theophilus]
Never want to let you go

[Verse 4: Theophilus London]
Back in the days when I was young
I'm not a kid anymore
But some days I sit and wish I was a kid again (entire verse 3x)
Want to go back to the days where everything was so pure
I'm so sure that everything will be the same way
Girl... The evolution of your body it's amazing
It's like I seen you grow right before my eyes
Im breathless... Im speachless...

[Hook]
Once again it's time to Depart(4x)
[Theophilus sings in between Hook]
Take me outa here Im finished girl
Can I talk to you now girl
[Jesse Boykins sing in between Hook after Theophilus]
Just want to take you back

[Theophilus falls from an emotional break down]
Yea... Uh
