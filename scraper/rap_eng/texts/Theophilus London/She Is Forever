[Verse 1 - MeLo-X]
I was gone for a minute, now I'm back with that black shit
Deep Space Nine, I return with the blackness
Traveling through time, but never hustling backwards
Gotta craft classics so you know that the fact is
In the future, my music will be better than its ever been
I can feel the melodies dripping from my melanin

It's evident, these lyrics is heaven sent
You can see the planet shift every time I represent

Its like I'm on a collision course with fate
Some of you got hatred written across your face
Cover it up with smile I still see that it's fake
But I bet you can still see that I'm great
It's The God

Jesse's still munching off the 'Itis
Everything I touch it's like I got the hands of Midas
Might just, bless a track shit you know I'm righteous
About to get buck, lick a shot, flick the lighters
It's sort of religious, my color is so vivid
It lives within my soul and it travels through my spirit

No matter who's the hardest, we're going the farthest
Even in the limelight you can call us the darkness


[Chorus - Jesse Boykins III]
We absorb the light
Stay one with the night
Manifest our charm, she means us no harm
She takes within our soul, the entire, all we know
She's treasures, past goals
She's back for us to take control

Take control (x4)

[Verse 2 - Theophilus London]
The sky is black, she said it's blue
See that was then, but this is new
Remote control, I got your mute
When you move your mouth, I think it's cute
The Black bamba, world ruler stop mama
And no crying, no rumors ask papa
See the Vibe here, you're the Ebony
You know the saying, we don't live like memories
