[Verse 1]
Bad boy is back, back in town
Bow down now
Nine girls, they freak me in the room
I found God
Gimme power, hear my spirit, heavenly lord
Thou shall not
Take my arm and eject your system
Why? Just to make me a victim?
What you want? What you got?
What you got? What you wanted?
I can feel the force take over
From the back to the front
And the boys and the girls from the future
Bring us back all the love
Indigo baby I stuck in the misses
Easier to form the electric connections

[Hook] x3
When you got someone who can fight for you
Give you what you need
Know your every move
Close your eyes and just catch the groove
Take control of me girl, come over me
Baby just set me free
And inject your soul, my heart

[Verse 2]
Right by now, reset your clock
Our time now
Yeah, you was with the shit all summer but
I shall not
Take a look over your shoulders
Girl you give me the blues
When I'm with you I got nothing to lose
And love has been away and confined in the groove
And confined in the groove
And confined in the groove

[Outro] x2
Take control of me girl, come over me
Baby just set me free
I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna get you
I'm gonna get you right now
And inject your soul, my heart
