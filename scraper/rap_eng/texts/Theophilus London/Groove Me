I want you to groove me baby
Take us to stars that's miles away
Let's groove if you want to (ohh now)

As I go off, don't get lost
We back in the city of the gems
Kiss me off till you get near
A new city shall began
Hold me down and catch this sound before it blows off in the wind
And realise in here the wise don't fear for years we campin in (come on)

I just got this feeling deep inside of me
Groove me baby
Catch my love
It could offer something
(aha aha aha)
I want you to groove me baby
Take us to stars that's miles away
Let's groove if you want to (ohh now)

Don't give it up dear you're so sincere the light lit up the room
In a deep space there's no return
I guess I'll see you in June
Land of the queens land of the kings
Let's rejoice and let's all sing
Take a vow or take this ring
Funky love that's y thing

I just got this feeling deep inside of me
Groove me baby
Catch my love
It could offer something
(aha aha aha)
Think about you every day every night
I know you want me baby
Catch my love
It could offer something
(aha aha aha)

Come to the lovers house it won't be far
The lovers house at night they go to sleep alone

Throw tissues in the air
The fire gather round
Her brother said to me she's not your cup of tea
Oh what a mystery at night they go to sleep alone

I just got this feeling deep inside of me
Groove me baby
Catch my love
It could offer something
(aha aha aha)
Think about you every day every night
I know you want me baby
Catch my love
It could offer something
(aha aha aha)

Come to the lovers house across the yard
The lovers house at night they go to sleep alone

Throw tissues in the air
The fire gather round
Her brother said to me she's not your cup of tea
Oh what a mystery at night they go to sleep alone
