Let me See ya hands, hands, hands (4x)

The night is at its peak, got the﻿ eye of a tiger
Been this way forever straight out my momma vagina
Theophilus divine, music my recliner
Separate, hella great, multiply her and divide her
This that New York nigga, belly of the monster
I run laps so on stage I'm a dancer
I inspire you, yeah I inspire you
And water inspires me, see waters inside of you
And the way the trees was made on the earth for us to breathe
You're a chick, or a breeze, you're a cough, I'm a sneeze
This is karma, Brooklyn yeah we on ya
Leave your head in the fridge, I'm talkin﻿g jeffrey dahmer
Yeah, these tight jeans, I don't rock 48's
Me on a verse is like you against 40 apes
40 nights, 40 days, I bet I eat 40 steaks
And I ain't mad, you can still rock the corny Bapes

[Hook - Jesse Boykins III]
I want to know, I want to know
I want to know, I want to know

So show me who you are, show me who you are
Show me who you are, show me who you are
Show me, show me, show me who you are
