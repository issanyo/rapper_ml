[Intro: Theophilus London]
Hey boy, hey, hey girl, hey
Hey boy, hey, hey girl
Hey boy, hey, hey girl, hey
Hey boy, hey, hey girl

[Verse 1: Rose Elinor Dougall]
I've done some dirty deeds
But I've never done a dirty deed to you
Years in the wilderness
'Til you found me and gave me something true

[Pre-Chorus: Rose Elinor Dougall]
Hey girl, you've lucked out
All the other girls, they can only stare
That boy, he's so beautiful
Sleeping in the chair

[Verse 2: Rose Elinor Dougall]
People change but we're still here
We set sail without a destination
Weathered storms along the way
Face-to-face with temper and temptation

[Pre-Chorus: Rose Elinor Dougall]
Hey girl, you've lucked out
All the other girls, they can only stare
That boy, he's so beautiful
Walking over here

[Chorus: Rose Elinor Dougall]
I've found what heart is
It's being next to you
Without a single breath
Between us (between us)
I've found what heart is
It's being next to you
Without a single breath
Between us (between us)

[Verse 3: Theophilus London]
Check it out
Let me tell you 'bout this girl called Rose
She just got the sensation
Said I'd be there around 3 o'clock
Inside your house, I've been waiting
Her mother and brother
They greet me, they're wonderful
Your house looks nice and your son does too
On his way to Sunday School
Summer's coming back on my mind
Get the girl, baby, I'll stand in line
You could bring your girls, I don't mind
Three nights, two days, I'll be fine
Get the bread, get the cheese, get the wine
Music blasting, have a good time
You and me, we're aligned
What ya say? What ya say?
Hey girl, hey

[Pre-Chorus: Rose Elinor Dougall]
Hey girl, you've lucked out
All the other girls they can only stare
That boy, he's so beautiful
Sleeping in the chair

[Chorus: Rose Elinor Dougall]
I've found what heart is
It's being next to you
Without a single breath
Between us (between us)
I've found what heart is
It's being next to you
Without a single breath
Between us (between us)
