This one for my day one fans

[Hook]4x
This one for my day one fans
Thank you y'all for making me who I am

[Verse 1]
How can I lose like never, homie it's obvious
Last name London, first name Theophilus
Can't lose, don't think I can
It's caps man who you think I am?
And if you don't know
Hello, hello
And if you want to rock
Fasho fasho
We never stay the same
We grow, we grow

[Hook]8x
This one for my day one fans
Thank you y'all for making me who I am

[Verse 2]
And this be the victory lap
I want our history back
Don't give me that
And yeah yeah, the mystery back
And let's watch the people react
I remember my first show
And you was front row
And outside was just slow
Like six, seven people
But you didn't care
Cause everybody had their hands in the air
Shout to the Flatbush fans
Shout to my cousin for the gear
Shawn, I love you I shed a tear
You put the mic in my hand with no fears
My grandmama do care
Mama JoAnn still care
Papa Moses still care
Don't worry, love, I'm almost there

[Outro]

Thank you y'all for making me who I am
This one for my day one fans
Thank you y'all for making me who I am
This one for my day one fans
Thank you y'all for making me who I am
