[Hook]
I want to be alone
I guess I'm in this world, tears of a lonely girl
A private place to roam
I left the best of me, up in the Western Sea
I want to be alone
I guess I'm in this world, tears of a lonely girl
A private place to roam
And this feel wanna bring me down, this feel wanna bring me down

[Verse 1]
In my Ber, I just came inside her
Oh my, he sacrifice her
Some talk, can't decide her
You cannot deny her
I just quit show, 9 to 5 her
Some trips, he try to buy her
BCs, ain't 'bout to drive her
You cannot deny her
She got a demon deep inside her
Some Catholic church revive her
And they say please bring the father
And that red, he try to dot her
Here, the only fear
I think I dropped it around last year
Bongo, bongo sounding clear
Let's take a walk along the pier

[Hook]
I want to be alone
I guess I'm in this world, tears of a lonely girl
A private place to roam
I like the best of me, up in the Western Sea
I want to be alone
I guess I'm in this world, tears of a lonely girl
A private place to roam
And this feel wanna bring me down, this feel wanna bring me down
I want to be, I want to be, I want to be alone
And this feel wanna bring me down, this feel wanna bring me down

[Verse 2]
Last night he tried to bribe her
Some rings and things to buy her
He said she's the woman of his dreams
Somehow, he can't deny her
She got a slight thing for Prada
She loves [?]
She chose to whisper louder
Seek the urge inside her
And once he gets to find her
The first instinct is to try her
And once she shines to pass the test
Yeah, she's the right girl
[?]
Escape this life for life girl
Damn, I'm sick as ham
Delivered man, in withered lands

[Hook]
I want to be alone
I guess I'm in this world, tears of a lonely girl
A private place to roam
I like the best of me, up in the Western Sea
I want to be alone
I guess I'm in this world, tears of a lonely girl
A private place to roam
And this feel wanna bring me down, this feel wanna bring me down
I want to be, I want to be, I want to be alone
And this feel wanna bring me down, this feel wanna bring me down
