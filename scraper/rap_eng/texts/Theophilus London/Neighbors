Uh, hey, hey what to say
Intend to stop me this given day
And oh, don't live in fear
Set the mid bar that visits here

Uh, it's gonna take the stars to convince me
To prepare or to be far when it hits me
You be here or you be gone at the new speed
You a roam from the room and it gets me

Ticka-ah ticka-ah, I want you
Butterflies, butterflies deep in to haunt you
In a nice way, and you have a nice day
And we both part ways and you feel hardly safe

Expect change and you protect names
And you say emotions gonna be the exchange
For all the lovers in the house tonight
If you feeling good than get frowst tonight
Tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, come on

Hey, hey, what to say
Intend to stop me this given day
And oh, don't live in fear
Set the mid bar that visits here

And uh-oh, who's gonna help you now?
What the mystery in this house
And no, don't blame my child
He would attempt to die for you to the end of days

We're pressed together when we're side by side
You hold me down baby, door by door
Uh, I got a feeling we should leave this town
Try with a run in my four-by-four

Moving away would be hell for me
I can't explain the way you smell to me
Hearing the wind, let's hear it again
With sibbolese and melodies seronating begins

Take time, get mail to them
Laying a tent, get hills again
Hey friends, because it because us
How the holiday got her

I make her proper and now we're enemy
Chick-ah ah, so innocent
I'll see you later but do me one favor
Promise to be a good neighbor

Promise to be a good neighbor
Promise to be a good neighbor
Promise to be a good neighbor
Promise to be a good neighbor

Hey, hey, what to say
Intend to stop me this given day
And oh, don't live in fear
Set the mid bar that visits here

And uh-oh, who's gonna help you now?
What the mystery in this house
And no, don't blame my child
He would attempt to die for you to the end of days

Hey, hey, what to say
Intend to stop me this given day
And oh, don't live in fear
Set the mid bar that visits here

And uh-oh, who's gonna help you now?
What the mystery in this house
And no, don't blame my child
He would attempt to die for you to the end of days
