[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Bad boy just stepped in town
Bad boy stepped in town
Ask for me, I'm world renowned
You ain't heard? I'm the baddest motherfucker around
Uh, we're what the people came to see
We came to break it down
Cut the lights, cue the sound
See the bodies hit the ground
Them pretty girls be textin'
They wonder where my stacks at
They call me futuristic
They think I am Mister Jetson
Uh, follow this tour bus
We'll get you to the next show
Un-forgetful
Dudes still be gettin' low

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Ooh, we go all around the world everybody singin' along
Never lookin' back, it's a long, long way from my home
Ooh, just tell the sheriff that the party's goin' on all night long
We are back and makin' music like it's nineteen sixty four

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
Hey, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, hey
Back on the road again
Hittin' Paris on a ten
Kiss my mom and call my friends
Seems like this tour would never end
These kids is fly, these kids got attitude
This is a little somethin' that I had to do
Cause tired of hearin' your crap
About who need to bring rap back
The girl, they snuck back stage like
"Can we get your autograph?"
The stupid interviews
Questions make us sorta laugh
Who are you to ask?
Tell my PR I'm gonna pass
Skip the whiskey, roll a joint
Plus my outfit stays on purple

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Ooh, we go all around the world everybody singin' along
Never lookin' back, it's a long, long way from my home
Ooh, just tell the sheriff that the party's goin' on all night long
We are back and makin' music like its nineteen sixty four

[Bridge: Theophilus London]
Melbourne, Paris, Tokyo, Berlin
London, Liverpool, Beijing, New York
Melbourne, Paris, Tokyo, Berlin
London, Liverpool, Beijing, New York
Uh, this feels so good right now
You're now listenin' to the world renowned international
International player, uh
All around the world, seen all around, the best
See many places, many different things
Every night I wake up and I respect
Close your eyes and go to dreams
I've seen it all, baby

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Ooh, we go all around the world everybody singin' along
Never lookin' back, it's a long, long way from my home
Ooh, just tell the sheriff that the party's goin' on all night long
We are back and makin' music like its nineteen sixty four

Ooh, we go all around the world everybody singin' along
Never lookin' back, it's a long, long way from my home
Ooh, just tell the sheriff that the party's goin' on all night long
We are back and makin' music like its nineteen sixty four
