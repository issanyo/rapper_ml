[Hook x2]:
Who you 'posed to be, nigga?
Can't see me, nigga
Ain't no cheap nigga
Don't know me, nigga

[Verse 1]:
Tell you who I am, Brooklyn don, in Japan
London town they flew to France
Hold it down, oh yes I am
Pack steam, turbine on
My ashy hands, foreign cars and 'em foreign lanes
Pound yo [?] in 'em Benz
Lead in 'em, you know I can
I got smokin' [?]
By the bar, I toke that champ'
Promote this gin
Get 'em scoping, get 'em hopin'
Get 'em open, yes I can
[?] focus, I'm the dopest, you the coldest
Know it then
Who you 'posed to be, trip?
Can't see me if
Not all my gin fit
Grind time, my team strip
Fine wine my G's dip
Get off my penis
Cannot live, just exist
I get it in, you peep this?
This gene is chocolate, unique skin
[?]
My hands lit, you hair set
Blue hairs, the air lit
I'm steppin' up and you [?] bitch

[Hook x2]:
Who you 'posed to be, nigga?
Can't see me, nigga
Ain't no cheap nigga
Don't know me, nigga
