[Verse 1]
Time I-I
Believe-eve that you-u
Just might be the one
Helped me see the light
Opened up my mi-ind
And made me whole
The fire in me
Drives me overboard
I'm lost in here
Take me far and wild
Take me to the sea-ea
And bring me home home

[Hook]
Hey Lisa why don't you come ov-er
Hey Lisa I wanna tell you everything
Hey Lisa been hanging by the telephone
Oh Lisa, my Lisa
Said I want cha body
Said I need, your body
Said I want cha body right now
Said I want cha body
I need, your body
I want cha body right now

[Verse 2]
You take my hand hold me
Make me your o-own
And drain my pain (um um)
Inspire the young
And all who believe-eve
That time will change-ange (oh oh)
Ti-ti-time again
I'm going to catch the city (ay ay)
Before the morning light (ay ay)
Ti-ti-time again
I'll meet you in the city (oh oh)
And look you in your eyes
And tell you (hey) baby!

[Hook]
Hey Lisa why don't chu come over (why don't you come over)
Hey Ashley I wanna tell you everything (I'll tell you all)
Hey Lisa hanging by the telephone (handing by the phone)
Oh Lisa (hey Lisa), my Lisa (say Lisa)
Said I want cha body
Said I need, your (oh oh) body
Said I (my lisa) want cha body right now
Said I (my lisa) want cha body (right now)
I need (oh oh), your body
I want (my lisa) cha body right now

[Outro]
So hey Lisa, keep hanging by your phone girl

Keep hanging by your phone girl(x2)
