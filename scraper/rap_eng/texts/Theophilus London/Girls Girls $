[Verse 1]
Tell these girls "Come over, let's have a mosh-pit"
I'm on my Ed jeans shit, hadn't lost it
Get your panties, keep 'em wetting like a faucet
Photo we just took, end up in Boston
Look, I'm just saying, on my Ric Flair clothes
Chest hair out, fresh pair of boats
Listen, I know you took the summer off
But it's the party of the year-take it off!

[Hook]
Money, girls, money, take it off
Money, girls, money, take it off
Money, girls, money

[Verse 2]
You fuck with TL have your world stop
She got drunk, showed her pussy on World Star
It's 1 to 9, and these girls bossy
(?) party where the girls are
Smoke in the air, fire (?)
That's your homeboy, no plus ones
I know you took the summer off
But it's the party of the year-take it off!

[Hook]
Money, girls, money, take it off
Money, girls, money, take it off
Money, girls, money

[Bridge]
