She give me loving in the morning time
A couple kisses and I’m good to go
Giving me honey in the rise and shine
Just a quickie but I want it so

She give me loving in the morning time
A couple kisses and I’m good to go
Giving me honey in the rise and shine (so bad)
Just a quickie but I want it so (I want it so bad)

Um, for morning sex
From nap until day of death
Hit you up, took the stuff to the left
Give it to you girl and looking on and back
Before I make business too
I take you down in my business suit
Come over here girl, yeah you cute
Enough’s been said, now play my flute
Hot sex between sheets
Like the way you receive me
About to text her, she need me
And this the place where you need to be
The morning dew, prepare the evening great
That’s no time for us to wait, hey

Giving me honey in the rise and shine
Just a quickie but I want it so
