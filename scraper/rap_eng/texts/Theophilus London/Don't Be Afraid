[Verse 1: Theophilus London]

Oh we should take a seat
One day, oh just you and me
And I just feel alive, when my heart, you got to use your mind
How could you deceive, when you love, that's not fair to me
Don't blame it on a child, and while you blame it on TV
And I just like to fuck, but girl, no need to be shy
Oh you will get your time, your mine, you will get to shine
Don't be afraid to die, 'cause one day you'll be allowed to fly

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]

Oh we should take a seat
One day, oh just you and me
And I just feel alive, when my heart, you got to use your mind
How could you deceive, when you love, that's not fair to me
Don't blame it on a child, and while you blame it on TV
And I just like to fuck, but girl, no need to be shy
Oh you will get your time, your mine, you will get to shine
Don't be afraid to die, 'cause one day you'll be allowed to fly
Oh we should take a seat, oh girl, let's have some wine and cheese

Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
