[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Tell you what I did last night
I came home, say, around a quarter to three
Still so high
Hypnotized
In a trance
From this body, so butter and brown and tantalizing
You woulda thought I needed help from this feeling that I felt
So shook I had to catch my breath

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes her skirt dropin' to her feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch careesing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
I tried and I tried to avoid
This thing from happening
Swallow my pride
Forget about it and party
But this body felt just like mines
I got worried
I looked over to the left
A reflection of myself
So shook I couldn't catch my breath

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes her skirt dropin' to her feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch careesing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?

[Verse 3: Theophilus London]
(Hey!)
Uh, midnight lover
Sex in the afternoon
I met you last night
I didn't mean to have it soon
Laughin' with each other
The tappin' one another
She tryna get it twice
She whispered under covers
T-H-E-O-P-H-I-L-U-S
L-O-N-D-O-N
Umm who else?
You best
It's just
???
They'll never know what's next
So it's just best to have them clueless

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes her skirt dropin' to her feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch careesing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?

(I looked over to the left, left, left)
Umm she was looking so good I couldn't reject myself
(I looked over to the left, left, left)
Umm she was feeling so good I had to touch myself
(I looked over to the left, left, left)
Umm I was eyein her thighs butter pecan brown
(I looked over to the left)
Umm comin outta her shirt and then her skirt came down

[Hook: Theophilus London]
Oops, there goes my shirt up over my head
Oh my
Oops, there goes her skirt dropin' to her feet
Oh my
Ooh, some kinda touch careesing my legs
Oh my
Ooh I'm turning red
Who could this be?

Ooh My
