[Verse 1: Theopohilus London]
You stole my heart like a thief in the night
Stopped in your tracks in the middle of a fight
To make it right let the brimstones burn
I’ll let you live yours, now let me have my turn
But you're wrong thinking you could stop time
A few hours ahead baby girl not mine
I look ahead I know you see the stop signs
Blind men know, it’s not green all the time time
You drive me insane Mrs. rain cloud
Moving on the road, took the same vow
Now I'm trying to u-turn on the way out
The fire all around us is played out
Standing on all fours on the bed
They say some things is better not said
But I think you better stick horns on your head
I think you better stick horns on your head

[Hook: Theophilus London & Sara Quin]
If you think you’re special, you’re probably not
Why even try (why even try)
Just living a lie (living a lie)
Never been like that (never been like that)
Why even try, why even try to change?

[Verse 2]
Okay okay Mrs. rain cloud
Make the sun shine 'til the days out
You’re not alone, call my name out
But what if, there’s no way out
And look, your words are inaudible
Reception is bad when I’m calling you
Confusion, and it’s the thought of you
You’re no spy, I’m onto you
This letter was written in bitter form
So read carefully, don’t get it wrong
See that's us, but that's gone
The scarecrows, in the back lawn
That's another dress, well put that on
I keep it real, is that wrong?
I think you better stick horns on your head
I think you better stick horns on your head

[Hook]

[Bridge: Sara Quin]
Making little sunshine
Til the days out
Making your sunshine
Til your calling my name out
What if there’s not a simple way out
Reception is bad and you’re calling me now
Never been like that
Never been like that


[Hook]
