[Verse 1]
Sitting by my window
Watching the moonlight
In my home
Suddenly my mind
Is bringing out desire
In my home (Baby)
So I got a woman
To put out this fire
Burning in my soul (Hey)

[Chorus]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Verse 2]
Soon I had a phone call (Hello?)
From a woman
In my home
She was burning
Burning of desire
Just like I do (That's right, baby)
She wanted me to
Put out this fire
Burning in her soul (What she say to me)

[Chorus]
Only you, Theo
Can put out this fire
Only you, Theo
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you baby
Can put out this fire (Only you)
Only you baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Verse 3]
Suddenly my woman
Was in my arms
In my home
She was loving me
69 times
In my home (Are you sure?)
She was putting
Putting out the fire
Burning in my soul (Really?)

[Chorus: Theophilus London and Kevin Parker]
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby (Only you)
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
Only you, Theo (Ahhhh)
Can put out this fire (Only you baby)
Only you, Theo
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul

[Outro]
Only you, baby (only you)
Can put out this fire
Only you, baby
Can put out this fire
Burning in my soul
