I got some, Crazy Cousins
I love my, Crazy Cousins
I got some, Crazy Cousins
I love my, Crazy Cousins
Hello my, Crazy Cousins
Hello my, Crazy Cousins

[Verse 1]
In the black cab in the fast lane
In the same town as my last name
London, and I'm wondering
The lover's trying to take down something

She earned two hundred pounds, and I ain't talking about the money shit
I'm just talking about a honey dip
I'm just playing on my funny shit

I love my fam
The best thing is they rep who I am

In my London accent
"How are you?" I'm excellent
"Who are you?" I'm excellence, nigga ask my cousins
They reside in London pimpin, and don't forget Brixton

[Bridge x2]
Sometimes I wake up early in the morning
To play my con con congos

I love to play my bongos in the morning
