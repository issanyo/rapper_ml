[Intro: Theophilus London]
Uh, uh, woo!
Yeah
96, 92
Uh, whiplash, whiplash
Whiplash, whiplash
Whiplash

[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Them boys acting all brand new, huh
I can peep it in your style, lil Theo, huh
Now they lookin' like they seen a ghost
When they know it's my vibe that they need the most
They need you around
She said Theo we need you in town (now)
And when the belly of the beast start churnin'
And the streets start burnin'
And the freaks start lurkin'

[Chorus: Theophilus London & Kevin Parker]
Whiplash, Whiplash
Head's in the future but your neck's in the past
Whiplash, Sitback
Whiplash, And they said
All of the damned
Head's in the future but your neck's in the past
All of the damned
Whiplash, Whiplash
Pressin' on the metal, got the blicky in the stash
Whiplash, Sitback
Whiplash, whip

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
I'm at the Knick game, big chain, all my spender
Big big smoke, I'm eating all y'all dinners
Tell big Kev it's gettin' warm this winter
Nick balls, big rock rock, I got winter

[Chorus: Theophilus London & Kevin Parker]
Whiplash, Whiplash
Head's in the future but your neck's in the past
Whiplash, Sitback
Whiplash
All of the damned

[Refrain]
I see you
I see you ain't outside lining the up and down
We don't wear lines we do lines
Walking up outside like its the 4th of July
Looking like its labor day in Brooklyn J'ouvert
I seen you act like Theo 2013 with the Chelsea boots on

[Chorus: Theophilus London & Kevin Parker]
Whiplash, Whiplash
Pressin' on the metal, got the blicky in the stash
Whiplash, Sitback
Whiplash
Whiplash, Whiplash
Head's in the future but your neck's in the past
All of the damned
Whiplash, Sitback
Whiplash, Whiplash

[Verse 3: Theophilus London & Kevin Parker]
Blam Blam, we might just Van Damme ya
Van Damme, the stuntin on Santana
Six foot stud, yeah understand her
Kevin Theo, back, back in Rio
Throwin' money off the boat, just like Leo
Girls on my shirt, yeah, here's some Theo
Lot of y'all startin' to look like clout chasers
I remember all of y'all faces
All of the damned

[Outro: Theophilus London & Kevin Parker]
Pressin' on the metal, got the blicky in the stash
All of the damned
Whiplash, Whiplash
All of the damned
