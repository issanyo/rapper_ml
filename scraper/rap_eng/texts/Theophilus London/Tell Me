[Chorus x2:]
Tell me if I’m hurting your heart
Tell me if I take it too far
Tell me if you wanna leave
Just tell me if I’m not what you need
Cause I'm seeing that things ain’t clear
Haters all in your ear
Baby I can understand
But I still gotta hear you tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
Sacred Layers, please do respond to the ones in need
Your eyes tell me something is needed, its bleeding
I know I know the coma arose to those that share your light
And fear your might, please be honest and ship your flight flee
Show me who you are tonight and you’ll be satisfied aight
But your mind speaks other and those propose their goes like brothers
And soon be men, but you who suspect and try to correct and often reject
When the right one sets his mind, his soul, his body, his goal, his time, his rose on you
You rose you are, how closed you are, I’m not tyson not here to fight
I recite the writings for lovers like us,  right
I recite the writings for lovers like us, right

[Bridge 1:]
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Oh

[Chorus x]
Tell me if I’m hurting your heart
Tell me if I take it too far
Tell me if you wanna leave
Just tell me if I’m not what you need
Cause I'm seeing that things ain’t clear
Haters all in your ear
Baby I can understand
But I still gotta hear you tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me

[Bridge 2 x3:]
I want to hear you say it
Girl I got to know the truth
Just let the words go
Girl I won't be mad at you

[Chorus:]
Tell me if I’m hurting your heart
Tell me if I take it too far
Tell me if you wanna leave
Just tell me if I’m not what you need
Cause I'm seeing that things ain’t clear
Haters all in your ear
Baby I can understand
But I still gotta hear you tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
