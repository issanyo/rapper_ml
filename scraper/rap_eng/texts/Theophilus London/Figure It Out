[Verse 1]
I've been running away from you for hours
I've been running away from myself
Can you believe in us? Worth fighting?
By ourselves, wanting to be more
You can wonder
Anything you’ve told yourself
It’s one thing you can never do yourself
Just lay relax I’m here to help
Baby it’s the only night that could be worth it
I can help you if we figure it out

[Chorus]
Tell me something that you (that you) think is worth it, oh I know someway so we can figure it out
So we can figure it out
So we can figure it out

[Verse 2]
The more you treat me, I adore you
That's why I don’t mind doing these things for you
When I reached the doors, I caught you on a Wednesday
Mr. TL on the phone, fuck what your friends say
It's the realist, it's trending, tell me, if you hear me
Lord, fuck the faith, give up any boredom
I fucked up, it's hard
