[Verse 1]
You enter emotion
And yes I enter perception
She gets a little closer
And I was gettin' all interested
Hopped in the 2 door [?] like a schoolboy
And we headed to the lake
Show me, show me, show me
Erotic love after the break

[Hook]
Gooooo
Talkin' 'bout tonight
Feel you want me
I can read the signs
So take it farther
Galaxy arrives
To be a heartbreaker
In the night

[Verse 2]
My mind is tellin' me no
But my friend downstairs says yes
I think you're sweet and innocent
But goddamn, wanna take off that dress
Immoral sex to impress
Kind of guy, I can't lie
So tell me, tell me what's next
Fly to the moon and see the sunrise
Pinot Grigio, LBRS in this ho
Fuck your politics, fuck your 9 to 6
Girl let me kiss your lips
When I dip, you dip, we dip
I'm on my guac and salsa shit
Take a hit, you've never had a taste like this
Only bosses floss like this

[Hook] x4

[Outro]
Feel you want me
So take it farther
Feel you want me
