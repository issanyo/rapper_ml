[Hook]
I turn my back on you
See I was blindfolded
Now I'm so sorry that you're gone, gone
I couldn't see the sun
But now it's brighter baby
Now I'm so sorry that you're gone, gone
My days is colder My night is long aye
I haven't seen you in a long time
Won't you come back again
I swear I promise baby
That, that nothing will go wrong,﻿ wrong
It seems like life is moving on
Don't know where where we went wrong
My friends are like "Man you gotta be strong"

Can't take the fact that you've been gone
You're the reason I write this song
Seems like days just look so long
Can't figure out where I ran out of words to say
You smell like some sweet parade
I guess words can't speak for﻿ me
You don't know what you mean to me
It's like you showed up like dream to me
A blue lookin like green to me
I sometimes can't sleep and eat
I still remember the scenery
I just hope that you come back

[Hook]
I turn my back on you
See I was blindfolded
Now I'm so sorry that you're gone, gone
I couldn't see the sun
But now it's brighter baby
Now I'm so sorry that you're gone, gone
My days is colder, my night is long aye
I haven't seen you in a long time
Won't you come back again
I swear I promise baby
That, that nothing will go wrong,﻿ wrong
It seems like life is moving on
Don't know where where we went wrong
My friends are like "Man you gotta be strong"

Don't know if we will ever be right [x2]
Oh can you find her, she lights my fire [x2]

I close my eyes sometimes And I feel you by my side, side The more I dream reality It just don't seem right, right
I wonder why﻿ we sunk and died over night, night
So true, so true [x2]

[Hook]
I turn my back on you
See I was blindfolded
Now I'm so sorry that you're gone, gone
I couldn't see the sun
But now it's brighter baby
Now I'm so sorry that you're gone, gone
My days is colder My night is lonely
I haven't seen you in a long time
Won't you come back again
I swear I promise baby
That, that nothing will go wrong,﻿ wrong
It seems like life is moving on
Don't know where where we went wrong
My friends are like "Man you gotta be strong"

Don't don't know know if we'll be right [x4]
Oh can you find her, She lights my fire [x4]
