[Intro]

[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Talking you like Mr. Braham
Fucking you all over emotion
You not tuned in to Theophilus
Younger to...like oh, shit
Tonight, I'mma slit my wrist
So I can pull out my vein
And play with that bitch
Like its a Guitar
Singing the song in the rain
Fucking the head, what's up with the head
Come talk in the bed
Her lipstick all red
My dick its all red
Just cut off her head, chop this...
Hello there, come on and suck
Just kissing on you
Got some problems, I'll listen for you
Have you ever made love to a psycho?
Made myko?
I like a hoodrat bitch with a stink bitch fucked up attitude
Who wear thick tights, smoke Newports
I like to go pick her up after school
Hmm, should I pay for the pizza
Or should I pay for the pussy?
I'mma pay for the puss-ty

[Hook: Lunice]
Loving you, til it all goes down
I wanna kill you, til I hear no sound
I dream of us, to live a life so far
I'm gonna kiss you, girl I'm in your town

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
Dream about me, dream about you
Think about me, ain't an option
Won't surprise her
Close your eyes girl
Open eyes, you got the power
All desire, I am your heavenly king
I am your heavenly boss
King & Queen
Hop on the wings
Making us fuck, head's on the cross
Heaven got a ghetto cus' I'll be there
Never gone settle bitch, I don't care
Take off your blouse, show me your rose
Disposable swag, give me a pose
Take off your blouse, show me your rose
Disposable swag, we're out of control

[Hook: Lunice]
Loving you, til it all goes down
I wanna kill you, til I hear no sound
I dream of us, to live a life so far
I'm gonna kiss you, girl I'm in your town
