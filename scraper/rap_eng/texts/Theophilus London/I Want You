[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Accept the new, Your picture on my phone I was expecting you
Arrived at the airport, I meet you outside
The girl in the blue dress, palm trees wild
Hazy streets, pale air breeze
Luggage is black and Balboa Sleeves
Crucifix me, Crucifix me. Mr. Lucifer ain't got nothing against me
Hotel stop! Pull up at the Ramada, light years ahead, she don't wear Prada
Church bells ring erp it was her momma
It's German built homie it ain't no Honda
I want you dear, I made it clear
I had dreams of us. A trickles glare
Blouse undone, and nibbled ears
Sunset drive, lipstick smeared
I need to tell you, there's sexual tension and not to mention, I'm getting red
This is black cat, won't you get ahead. Start a new day let the better spread
Monotone fops hit my Moscots I'm thinking we should dash over time with sash-spots
Because your hands on my hands, your skin on my hands. Your skin thats my plan
Follow through

[Hook: Marvin Gaye]
Hey, Hey, I want you. I want you, I want you the right way
You know I want you but I want you to want me too
I want you to wan me to, just like I want you
I give you all the love, I want in return sweet darlin'
But half of love is all I feel
It's too bad, it's just too sad
You don't want me now
But I'm gonna change your mind
Someway, somehow, oh baby
