[Verse 1:]
It's time to live it up, oh
You get sent the fine wine deliverables and chocolate candles
It's time to live it up, oh
Horse and carrots, ride round the riddler and rock chinchillas
Girl I ain't going nowhere, sit here and play cops and robbers down by the moonlight
Sunrise it's time to go, grab your phone take some pictures
Love in modern time

[Hook:]
If we just go for a ride
Speed of light ignoring the signs
I'll race you to St. Harvest Way

[Verse 2:]
It's time to live it up, oh
You get sent the fine wine deliverables and chocolate candles
It's time to live it up, oh
Matching shiny shoes dressed like Thriller and watch Godzilla
It's a lovely Sunday, sit here and crack a big ole lobster, shrimp and pasta
I seen your face when I call, grab you phone change your status
Love in modern time

[Hook:]
Hey
If we just go for a ride
(If we just go for a ride)
Speed of light ignoring the signs
(Speed of light)
I'll race you to St. Harvest Way
(Oh, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon... c'mon, mon)
Diamonds what were sending in time
(Diamonds what were sending in time)
Illusions they can fall through the mind
(Fall through your mind)
Hey lookout go the other way
(Hey c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)

[Verse 3:]
Hey
It's time to live it up, oh
Alright I want to introduce you to Mr. London
Take the night out I've been wondering
Hit the coast, and cruise the beach
Cop the flavor, taste like peach
Conversations go your way, talk to me take it to the U.K
T.N.T. consider the topic it's the function for why I'm in the Tropics
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon

[Hook:]
Hey
(Not one place, not one time)
If we just go for a ride
(Read my face and drink your wine)
Speed of light ignoring the signs
(Speed of light)
I'll race you to St. Harvest Way
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Hey
(Not one place, not one time)
Diamonds what were sending in time
(Diamonds what were sending in time)
(Read my face and drink your wine)
Illusions they can fall through the mind
(Fall through your mind)
Hey lookout go the other way
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon)
Hey
