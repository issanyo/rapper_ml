All lyrics will be available for "Alone" will be available upon release

My mind knows words that you keep
Cause like you just prey on the weak
I had to hit one time for the road
Alone, a-alone
My mind knows words that you keep
Cause like you just prey on the weak
I had to hit one time for the road
Alone, a-alone
