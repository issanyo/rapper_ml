[Intro]
Baby, you're the one for me
Beautiful, in magazines
Something that I've never seen
Let me in your dreams
Baby, you're the one for me
Beautiful, in magazines
Something that I've never seen in this century

[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Uh, take off like a rollercoaster
Lights off, layin' on the sofa
Time passes, I move it closer
Take it down for the night, it's over
Wake up, can you paint my canvas?
Hot chick, so your name is Candice
So fly, you'd think I'm plantin' this
Senorita, that's Spanish
From my knees I can't manage
My past life, it's damaged
Had to break her in Paris
And now I'm just stuck on the image of you
We ain't got to front, it's the little things too
And when I'm far away, I'm missin' my boo
Have a drink on me, and here's to the century

[Hook: Devonte Hynes]
I don't wanna waste my time
I just wanna love your mind
Give you all my good, good time
And let me you see you melt your mind
Baby, you're the one for me
Beautiful in magazines
Something that I've never seen
Let me in your dreams
Baby, you're the one for me
Beautiful, in magazines
Something that I've never seen in this century
In this century

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
Let's go
Cheap pass, first class, slow it down, just a lil' bit
She caught the bait you cronies, take a snapshot, killin' it
Take you around the world
Backdrop, feelin' it
Seashore, fishermen
It'd be more intimate
Search Earth for a hundred years, still can't find no one closest there
Look like we got a stormy night
Let's camp out til' the coast is clear
Seagulls approachin' us, predicting the isle is close to us
Til' then, have a drink on me
And here's to the century

[Hook: Devonte Hynes]
I don't wanna waste my time
I just wanna love your mind
Give you all my good, good time
And let me you see you melt your mind
Baby, you're the one for me
Beautiful, in magazines
Something that I've never seen
Let me in your dreams
Baby, you're the one for me
Beautiful, in magazines
Something that I've never seen in this century
In this century
