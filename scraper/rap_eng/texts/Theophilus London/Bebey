[Verse 1]
Breaking the evening, off
Catching a nice breeze thru the day line
Singing in my mind it's the way life goes
Ain't cutting a man slack imma take mine
The love is alright and the grace shall show
Sun down I'll meet you by the sea line
I'll whip it off ya top while ya braid my hairrrrr
Braid my hairrrrr

[Chorus]
Baby you on top of me
Fills my heart times three
I'm flawed in ectasyyy
Baby you on top of me
Fills my heart times three
I'm flawed in ectasyyy

[Verse 2]

Get our groove again
She want a fine grown fella
Something smooth again
Take the top of feeling make me ooze again

Kissing on her neck I got respect for the coochie
Groove to groove me don't groove to lose me

[Verse 3]
I hop on the next flight to Soweto
These two girls they sat right behind my chair
Dear god, I thank you for the double
Bismillah you know jeans Dior
Oh lord she move to the baseline
And her top lineeee it make her waist line
Goooooo it make her waist line goooo

[Chorus]
Baby you on top of me
Fills my heart times three
I'm flawed in ectasy
Baby you on top of me
Fills my heart times three
I'm flawed in ectasy

[Verse 4]
Watch how she grooves to the baseline
It make her west line gooooo
It make her west line gooooo
Baby babe gave u all my trust
I done paved the way to make all this such
I love u more, do you love me more?
I'm waiting and waiting to get off this tour
Baby babe as we take our hearts
Learn to pray as we make this start
Lonely sins they come out the dark
Love will wash them off

[Outro]
Breaking the evening, off
Breaking the evening, off
Breaking the evening, off (haha, I told you, I told you I was gonna [?])
Breaking the evening, off
You on top of me
Fills my heart times three
