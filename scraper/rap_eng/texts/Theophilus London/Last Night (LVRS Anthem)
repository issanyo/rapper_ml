Show your nasty side
Show your nasty, uh
Show your nasty side
Show your nasty
Show your nasty side, girl
Show your nasty
Show your nasty
Show your nasty

[Verse 1]
Blue shoes on my feet
? on my ?
Like from another ship
Just can't fuck with it
King in the fuckin streets
In and out of ?
Airport, back seats
That's how I'm lovin' that
Sorry for Diddy but no Ciroc
Hope you got Bushmills all in stock
Call up her, call up I
With all of y'all, we call the shots
When I go in, it's all no end
And y'all don't want cause y'all won't win
Fuck it, whatever situation you in
Prosper and acknowledge the
Teach us and inspire then
Come with us into this end
Sacred hearts til we begin
Journey of love, a journey of sin

[Hook 1]
Got that good drink in my cup
Got that little purple, roll it up
See that party from last night got me fucked up
Switch it up nice
Hit my tongue out while I'm doing my thing
Man I'm crunk and I'm bumped
It got me fucked up
Cause I'm on a ride
Feelings alive
I'm on a ride
Feelings alive
Got that good drink in my cup
Got a little purple, roll that up
See that party from last night, it got me fucked up
Girls in the cut
Rolling that dice, nigga nigga wassup
See that party from last night, it got me crunked up

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
I been hittin that back all night
Girl yea, it's numb, numb
This some new shit for the year
Watch the club go dumb, dumb
Gettin that new money, throw the old money in the trunk, trunk
Til my heart rate speeding up like the beat in the drum, drum
Brooklyn baby, no introduction, no recital
Did you miss me boo, cause when you kiss me boo that's your revival
Nigga I met all my idols
Plus the feeling in New York is vital
Trilled kegs, doin' real big things
Tryna kill things, take the title
Wake up, look in the mirror
I see the image of a natural born killer
Girl I know this road will take us far
But I know a road that can make us iller
Make us killers, make us realer
Smeared the fake love, the feat of a billa'
Put this in the sky, you know I look high
And I'm just fly
Baby bye-bye
Mama don't curse, papa don't curse
She said "boy you better watch your tongue!"
I just took her up on my tongue
Open her blouse, say lemme get some
Sleep all day, drinks in the night
Peeps at night, I wanna see her with the lights on
She said "TL you good" I say "right, uhh"

[Hook 1]

[Hook 2]
Girls in the cut
Rolling that nice, nigga nigga wassup
See that party from last night, it got me fucked up
Switch it up nice
Got my tongue out while I'm doing my thing
Man I'm crunk and I'm bumped
It got me fucked up
Sippin' that good drink in my cup
Got a little purple, roll that up
See that party from last night, it got me fucked up
