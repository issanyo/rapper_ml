[Intro]
I'm Ultraviolet, but they say that I'm blue
I'm Ultraviolent, but they say that I'm cool
(Ultraviolet)
Gimme gimme gimme some more
Gimme gimme gimme some more
(Ultraviolent)
I'm Ultraviolent, you Ultraviolent too

[Hook 2x]
No, you don't have to go, tonight you must stay
No, you don't have to go, tonight you must stay
No, you don't have to go, tonight you must stay
No, you don't have to go, tonight you must stay
They say that life will never end
I hear it time and time again

From Here, the lyrics vary slightly in each song:

(Ultraviolet)
It's my nightmare, my nightmare, my nightmare
This is my nightmare, my nightmare, my nightmare
Can you feel it? Can you feel it?
This is what you do to me

(Ultraviolent)
[Verse - Sample Singer]
It's cold, but I'm warm
Standing in the shadows, they resent my face
I'm alone, it feels good
Away from everyone, just when I should

[Verse - Theophilus]
I can't feel my face, what's happened to me
Thoughts don't get slow, more rapid for me
There's a whole world lonely, clapping for me
You are me so, just tap into me
I can't feel my face, what's happened to me
Dark soul, misnomer rapping for me
There's a whole world lonely, clapping for me
You are me so, just tap into me

A riot, can you feel it? (x12)
