[Hook: Trouble Andrew]
Snow angel
Snow angel
You're no angel
Fly away now
Snow angel (Uh in the heavens up above)
Snow angel (Uh in the heavens up above)
You're no angel (And all the angels take care of this fly nigga)
Fly away now (And all the angels take care of this young nigga)

[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
Poured the Ace of Spades on the ground, call it gold snow
Had the black ice on me so I drove slow
She want the cake, she want the Molly, want the cold blow
She got her wings, her Jeremy Scotts, my nigga blow smoke
Blow, blow, take me to the heavens
Balmain white suit, (I think I'm Yoko Lennon)
Don't fuck with trouble, that's my cousin, he got the semi
Protect your neck, protect your set
Protect your bitch, protect your checks, (protect your checks)
Giuseppe diamond slippers got me looking like the hamburglar
She wanna dance in my fur, let's take this thing further
I might go to 106 and Park with four blondes
On my Dennis Rodman, I'm 'bout to go yellow
L'uomo Vogue ciao bella muthafucka hellooo
At the darby late night like I'm Jay Lenoooo
Steaming in the jacuzzi, feeling woozy
Tripping, sipping on the patrucy, bumping Boosie

[Hook]

[Break: Trouble Andrew & Theophilus London]
Yeah, it's going down (It's going down baby)
Oh, watch it go down (What you gon' do nigga?)
Yeah, it's going down (It's going down baby)
Oh, watch it go down

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
Yo trouble, I got these demons hiding in my living room
TL style, meanwhile I was in the edit room
Sketching my lifestyle that they gon' get in-tuned
I already wore that shit, I already fucked that bitch
Nigga, you gon' get it soon
We the children of the moment, mu' fucka better not condone it
This that Ricky Owens, I only wear it when it's snowing
Flight after flight in my flight like I'm Boeing
Sometimes I only see the nights, I never get to see the mornings
Hit you with the blocka, hit you with the choppa
Hit you with the Popeye, hit you with the Conan
Nigga you are so-so, thought I'd let you know bro
Tell 'em let it go go, nigga we up on it
When the lovers walk in, you see all the cameras surround us
Yo trouble, look at all the snow angels around us

[Hook]
