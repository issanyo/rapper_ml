[VERSE]
If you wanna build a home
Where the seasons fairly warm
Summer birds they sing their song
To you and me
You're 300 miles away
I'm not coming home today
Not until the flowers bloom
For you and me

[HOOK]
Even if you're in Rio de Janeiro
I'll give you all my
Affection affection
Making it easy, when you're lonely
You can just call me, I'll be there

[Rap]
All the girls in rio all the girls in São Paulo alright

[VERSE 2]
Girl I'm down and on my knees
Saying darlin won't you sing for me
Can we meet at Lovers lane
When the morning rise
You coming down on me (down on me)
This feeling is all I need (all I need)
The vision of love is purely bright
Through the darkest nights

Woo, hey, go on girl
Wooo, hey, uhh, woooo

[Hook]
Even if your in Rio de Janeiro
I'll give you all my
Affection affection
Making it easy, when your lonely
You can just call me, I'll be there [x2]
Even if you're in Rio or São Paulo
Ill give you all my
Affection affection
Making it easy, when your lonely
You can just call me, ill be there
