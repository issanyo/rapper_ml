[Hook]
Don't lie
When I'm askin' for the truth, you've got to say it
Don't tell me when it hurts cause I won't care
You've got to be the past for what you are
That's the law
That's the law

[Verse 1]
Stand up
You've been layin' down next to the office in the hallway
Don't tell me when you're not on your vacation
You have no time to even take a shower
Oh please, please tell me what I'm up against

[Brigde]
Hey I, I, I
Hey I
Hey I, I, shit

[Verse 2]
You ain't even know it
They was waiting for you to tweet out your location
These satellites [?] to reach you
Black and blue as the skies is the boy's head
Oh please, please don't, she's innocent
That's the law, that's the law
