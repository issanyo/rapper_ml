I fell in love with a disco queen
In the heart of the city at a bistro scene
A long story short, chick kinda at lost term
In the house to the port

We took a trip down Mexico
I nearly shopped myself like plexico
And with a mouth so fast, she was technico
Don't turn to a festival, hey

You walk to the show
I slept through the day, done nothing more
The sky lit up the stars
We're million miles apart to get where you are

Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time
Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time

Catch rest in the motel room
When the roosters call, I escape this doom
The humming bird is the humming man
Six years later you will understand

I spoke four words from the last night
Night, yikes
And the motherland for another life
Or another man, damn

You walk to the show
I slept through the day, done nothing more
The sky lit up the stars
We're million miles apart to get where you are

Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time
Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time

Try make the most of this
Don't throw it all away
She had to change her number twice
And no time to count the days

She a disco queen
Party all night like ya shit so clean
If you meet those eyes
It might be me in the deep skies

You walk to the show
I slept through the day, done nothing more
The sky lit up the stars
We're million miles apart to get where you are

Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time
Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time

You walk to the show
I slept through the day, done nothing more
The sky lit up the stars
We're million miles apart to get where you are

Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time
Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time

Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time
Is that what you want?
'Cause love is real, just look at the time
