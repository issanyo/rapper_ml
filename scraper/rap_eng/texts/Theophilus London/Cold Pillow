[Bridge - Jesse Boykins III]
And I wonder
The strangest feeling taking me under
You had purpose, see you were my lover
And now you're taking chunks of me

[Theophilus]
Don't wanna free her, her
Tearing me up, up
Don't wanna need her, her
Don't wanna see her, her
It's gonna be a, a

[Hook x4]
It's gonna be a, a
It's gonna be a cold, cold pillow tonight

[Verse - Theophilus]
I can't speak no more, for I'm speechless
You made me strong, but you became weakness
Rain in town, I'm down tryna defeat this
This sickness, that I witness

Times together, they became senseless
Her minds were other wheres, other fares
Came true to light, like love affairs
But you took for granted how a brother cares
[This verse 2x]
And now you're changing it up, up
Don't wanna give up, but
Don't wanna live uh, uh
It's fucking me up, up
But waking me up, up
Forsaken for what, what
It's taking me up, up
Mistaking for her, her
It's gonna be a

[Hook]

Gotta get her uh uh (x a lot)

[Verse 2 - Theophilus]
So I'm rolling around town, inbound just trying to figure out
Came a close pros, now foes ripping the picture out
Clothes, dirt thrown, we're grown but still kiddin out
Trying to maintain my sane, but you trippin out

What do we get from this
Best kept on this
Let's bet on this
I'm set on this
Get wet on this
You next on this
Your neck on this
B-Bless on bitch (6x)
You Bless on Bitch
Bless on Bitch
