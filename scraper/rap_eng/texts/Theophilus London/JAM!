[Verse 1]
OOM, 6 inch Boom
You better get ready for the sound that's (Ah)
In tune with what you doin, I iPod, you Zune (ah ah)
Do you understand this mission? Inventing, you listening
You kids make records that's void, I make records build noise
Milk can take your toys, you go play with boys
No disrespect to the man on this song
I'm like, "why can't we all get along?"
I'm here for a reason, Got Tofu music, Vegans
That's beef that's good with seasoning
Yo Micheal tell these Heathens

[Micheal Jackson's JAM first verse and Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ok, I'mma change it up
All you gangster guys your fame is up (Sorry)
Do you got the fame or what? If not dog why even bring it up?
So I'mma Jam, like Mike in 89'
I can say whatever I want in any line
What you rushin for babe? We got plenty time
It's time to give me mine

[Heavy D's Verse and Hook]
