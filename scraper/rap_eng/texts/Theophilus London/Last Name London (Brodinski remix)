And this here is my destiny
And it felt more fuckers death for me
Last night, evil stole my heart
But somehow I feel it resurrect in me

So toast out now, keep testing me
And you can talk your shit but have the check for me
And if your whole team from Long deserve the hip hop
Tell them they can get off my Herbie Hancock

It's more refresh breath could be
And if you don't know I tell you what's next for me, for me
From the bird's view, from the third view
In the sky without no curfew

From the bird's view, in the sky without no curfew
I know you've been waiting for the thunder
Let's give them the Indian summer

Last name London, first name Theophilus
Theophilus, The-Theopilus
Last name London, first name Theophilus
Theophilus, The-Theopilus

People back to call me caps
But when you gonna drop that new shit
Home boy it's Theopilus the son
They wrote no more taken from a full of shit

Pick, pick up the phone
It's a girl trying to interview the spit in my cool shit
Is she coming over, fifty-fifty win
No home takin' no job, oh shit

The whole city covered in white
She discovered the light
Yeah, she get naked on Skype
And now she wear my night

Yes, I ain't gon' bow down to no man
I'm gonna say, "Aldo, that's cold, huh?"
I don't battle, I come program
Ge-ge-get broke to come grind

In this here blight excellence
It's a nation of bloom black wrestlin'
I give them the elbow like Ray Johnson
I'm on Elizabeth like Steve Vossen

I'm with a rap chick gettin' a feed 'doption
Who got her hair red like Dee Votman
You can't stop now, I'ma keep boppin'
You a gay welfare nigga keep rockin'

Back to the rich front reflection
Some cops gave some change for the next trip
We go out for blaze source of action
They call me Flavor 'cause I rap shit

If you bite your directions
Popo in the back we rap shit
Super bad, save you, do me a favor
Keep getting your paper, come on
