[Theophilus London]
The journey starts beneath the stars I stand alone
I put all my fears to all these years, swept away they're known
And know I run this town to be near you
And no gray skies ever turn blue

[Hook: Theophilus London]
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone

[Verse 1: Theophilus London]
The rain is phenomenal, the way that it falls
Slammin' down like a domino and lay in the moss
Said today is a new day, I'm lookin' for new prey
I'm tryin' to survive, tryin' to take in this loss
The clothes don't make the man
It's the man that makes the clothes
And if this war doesn't end there's nothing left to fight
And I'm sure you'll have it tonight

[Hook: Theophilus London]

And know I run this town to be near you
And no grey skies ever turn blue

[Verse 2: Theophilus London]
It's the skill and the confidence
The will and the dominance
The deeper you get, the more the Reaper is prominent
When Uncle Sam knock on door
I tell him that I'm headed for the dock on the shore
Sailin' away, are you comin' with?
Just pack for the stay, cause we're finna get, get (heh)
The war don't end there's nothing left to fight
And I'm sure you'll have it tonight
'Till I stand alone

The journey starts beneath the stars I stand alone
I put all my fears to all these years, swept away they're known
And know I run this town to be near you
And no grey skies ever turn blue

I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
I stand alone
