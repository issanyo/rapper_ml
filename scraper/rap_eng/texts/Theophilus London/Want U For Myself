Want you for... (fades in)

[Hook: Peter Hadar]
Oh. I really want you for... want you for myself
And no one else (2x)

[Verse One: Theophilus London]
I don't want to be stingy, but I want you to come home with me
You don't know me but your gone miss me
Take my hand and the rest is history, uh
Come on on me girl and let me whisper in your ear
And tell you things you like to hear, in my life I have no fear
Um, Only him, only God that is again
Feel the breeze, touch the wind
Kiss my lips, let's make sin
Only cause we ain't wedding rings, lets just, lets just settle in
Learn and grow, close the door
Touch the floor, let me know
Peace

[Hook: Peter Hadar]
Oh. I really want you for... want you for myself
And no one else (2x)

[Verse Two: Theophilus London]
This is forever making the dance floor turn to fire (Crowd repeat once)
When you see me, three wishes Im your Genie
Sweet kisses girl believe me
Lipstick pink black hair it and your bikini
And I wonder like Stevie
When you dream, do you see me?
And it seems it's so easy, it don't take too much to please me
Im yo dollar, in me you trust
In me you lust, in you I bust

[Verse Three: Peter Hadar]
Oh girl, I've seen a lot of beauty before
But, yours is one that I can't ignore
It's doing something great to me
Uh, Hm. Im greedy so I just want more, so much that I can not store
I said that it would bring some better days and oh
Baby, yea yea

[Hook: Peter Hadar]
Oh. I really want you for... want you for myself
And no one else (2x)
