[Intro]
I told 'em I'm way up
Vibin', vibin'
Don't you know that we way up
Vibin', vibin'
Thought I told you I'm way up
Vibin', vibin'
Don't you know that we way up

[Verse 1]
Look, yeah
You told me life's what you make of it
Every momentâ€”I take it in
I'm not embarrassed to say that we've always had issues
I'm embarrassed to say that we never took care of 'em, yeah
Pain will always find its way to the surface
No matter how deep we bury him
Growin' up, I felt like no one ever listened to me
Eventually, I took that out of relationships (woo!)
I put my arm around you, and I mean it, I love you to death
These are the moments I know I'ma always hold onto and cherish 'em, yeah
Life's about taking chances, making moves
Not about what you did, it's what you do
Life's about taking chances, making moves, yeah

[Chorus]
I said that we way up
Vibin', vibin'
Don't you know that we way up
Vibin', vibin'
Taught I told you I'm way up
Vibin', vibin'
Don't you know that we way up
Vibin', vibin'
I said that we way up
Vibin', vibin'
Don't you know that we way up
Vibin', vibin'
Taught I told you I'm way up
Vibin', vibin'
Don't you know that we way up
Vibin', vibin'

[Outro]
Vibin'
