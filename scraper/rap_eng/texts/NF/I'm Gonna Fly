[Intro]
Yeah
You ever have one of them days
When you wake up and you wish you could just forget about everything
Throw the pain away for just one minute?
Look at the sunshine instead of the rain
You know what I mean?
Smile

[Verse 1]
I was driving down the road today
And saw the sun shine through my window
It made me smile
Yeah, I ain't done that in a while (that in a while)
Yeah, I saw a rainbow up in the sky
It made me wanna grow wings and spread them and fly
I could if I tried to
Listen, heck, the birds in the sky do (the birds in the sky do)
Sometimes I see the rain coming up in the clouds
I could care less, let the rain come down on my face
Wash the pain away (wash the pain away)
See, I don't like the feeling of losing control
But at least for one moment, Imma let things go and just be myself
Spread my wings and yell (wings and yell)

[Chorus]
I'm gonna fly
I don't care what nobody says
And I don't care what nobody thinks
I'm gonna fly
Forget about everything else and put a smile on and just be me
I'm gonna fly
Forget about the tears in my eyes and for a moment, leave it all behind me
I'm gonna fly (yeah)
Yeah, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I was driving down the road today and saw the rain fall on my windshield
It made me sad
But then I laughed (then I laughed)
Cause everybody knows it's gotta rain
Sun wouldn't feel so good if it never felt pain
I like that sound
But when I look around (I look around)
I see people just like me
Sick of dealing with the pain, trying to follow their dreams
And I get lost in the moment
In case you haven't noticed (yeah)
Everybody wants love, but I don't know where to find it
So I wrote a song as a little of a reminder
Just be myself
And nobody else (nobody else)

[Chorus]
I'm gonna fly
I don't care what nobody says
And I don't care what nobody thinks
I'm gonna fly
Forget about everything else and put a smile on and just be me
I'm gonna fly
Forget about the tears in my eyes and for a moment, leave it all behind me
I'm gonna fly (yeah)
Yeah, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly, yeah)

[Verse 3]
This is my moment
So I'm gonna do my best to control it
I feel like I'm walking through a door that has never been opened
What's on the other side
I don't have a clue where I'm going
To be honest, I could care less if anyone knows it
I put on a smile
And both of my feet through the door
All of a sudden, I don't feel the pain anymore
For some reason, I feel like I'm apart from the ground
Like every pain that I'd ever felt is off of me now
Must be flying or something
What am I, up in a cloud?
Look at me, wow, well this is kinda freaking me out
Must be a dream
Either way, I don't wanna come down
Like the feeling of feeling like I've no longer been bound
Turn around for a second
I look back and the door shut
Maybe I should go back, but I don't know for what
Come on Nate, you must be losing your mind
Maybe so, but here I go
Follow me up to the skies (singing)

[Chorus]
I'm gonna fly
I don't care what nobody says
And I don't care what nobody thinks
I'm gonna fly
Forget about everything else and put a smile on and just be me
I'm gonna fly
Forget about the tears in my eyes and for a moment, leave it behind me
I'm gonna fly (yeah)
Yeah, I'm gonna fly (I'm gonna fly, yeah)
