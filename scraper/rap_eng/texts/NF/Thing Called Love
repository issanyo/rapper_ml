[Chorus]
This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

[Verse 1]
Check, check, ayy, listen!
Yo, love is like a drug that everybody uses
You wanna know the outcomeâ€”depends on how you use it
Love could be your best friend, love could be your enemy
Love could be the thing you wish you had, but you don't ever see
And love can be the reason why you're afraid to have it
Some say it like it means something, others it's a habit
And some would say it's tragic, and some would say it's beautiful
Some would say it's black and it's dark like a funeral
And some would die for it, some don't think it's even real
Some say they understand, but really don't know how it feels
Some say that it's alive, some say that it can kill
But most of us that been in it know that sometimes it will
I ain't gonna sugarcoat it, yet sometimes it might surround you
One minute it's savin' you, next it's tryin' to drown you
Some people want to show it, but were never taught how to
And some of us is searchin', feelin' like it never found you

[Chorus]
This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

[Verse 2]
Yo, love is like a privilege, a lot of us abuse it
Do with it what we want and then start drama when we lose it
Pretend like it ain't nothing to us, pretend that it's useless
And we don't know why we do this, but yet we still pursue it
And love, it can consume you, turn you into something else
Bury the real you so deep that you can't even find yourself
Love, it can change you, love, it can tear you down
Be the best thing you ever had and kick you on the ground
Yo, you get on that high level, yet you scared to fall
'Cause you know if that person hurts you, you gon' lose it all
They told you they would be there for you, they don't even call
So that openness you used to have has now become a wall
And some say that it's patient, some say that it's kind
I don't think it's invisible, but I know that it's blind
To some it's only physical, or all up in their mind
See, it probably isn't there if you're strugglin' to find it

[Chorus]
This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love

[Verse 3]
This love has got me down low, now I guess I'm up high
One minute I'm on the ground, next minute I'm in the sky
I feel invincible, and so unrejected
Forget it, I'm invisible, and I feel unprotected
Yo, I don't need nobody else, trust me, I'm fine
I can't do this by myself, I'm losing my mind
Yeah, I can see clearly, forget it, I'm blind
My heart says, "danger," can't you read the signs?
Yo, but through all the pain, I swear I love it
No matter what you do, it don't disappear, does it?
Yo, I'd rather spend a minute with love in my life
Than go a million years without knowing what it's like
You better grab it, you don't wanna lose it
And yeah, it brings pain, it's insane, but the bruises
My God can take that all away, you'll find that right person
And everything you thought that wasn't becomes worth it

[Chorus]
This thing called love can be so cold
It can be miserable, or it can be beautiful
This thing called love can be so cold
Sometimes it's amazing, sometimes it's crazy
This thing called love
