[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Verse 1]
When I was 12, I created a dream and told myself that rap was all that I need
You put a knife in my heart, I swear to God, music is all that I bleed

[Verse 2]
I don't hide behind beats, I am raw, listen
These beats hide behind me, y'all are all trippin'
I cut 'em open, I let 'em leak, I'm what you call vicious
A boss with it, I write a song with my arms missin'
That's off-of-the-top music, I am bar rippin'
Y'all lookin' for lukewarm rhymes, you're in the wrong kitchen
I'm known as a lot of things, but calm isn't one of them
I'm close to the music, never been long distance
The industry had the doors locked, but I barged in it
I don't belong here? Ah, who are y'all kiddin'?
You against me, you're all victims, all thinkin' the
