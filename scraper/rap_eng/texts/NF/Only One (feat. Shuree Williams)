[Verse 1: NF]
God if you ain't in the picture, I don't wanna be apart of it
Tryna keep my pride with me, You tell me to swallow it
Yea so I swallowed it, broke open and bottled it
You took all my sins and told me that You'd demolish 'em
And I ain't gotta live like I ain't got no direction
You just took my hands and You gave me the directions
Now I'm on the right road lookin' at the right map
I might take a bad turn but You steer me right back
Let's go, yea
I'm feelin' better than I ever did
Uh, yeah, better than I ever was
I dare someone to say what better is
Can feelin' better than this is somethin' I never done
I put my hands up and I praise You
I ain't even gotta trip, I'm unashamed too
You see the things of this world, they don't fill me up
You're pourin' out Your love, I want You to fill my cup

[Chorus: Shuree Williams]
And I'll show the world
You're the only One for me
You're the only One for me
(2x)

[Verse 2: NF]
Yeah You give me grace, even though I don't deserve that
Don't know how to thank You, don't know where the words at
On the other hand, I just feel speechless
But I got a lot to say, so might as well speak it
I'm nothin' but a sinner, I don't know why You accept me
Your arms wide open, why are You so accepting?
Hangin' with the world, thought I had the best things
Then I turned around and realized that y'all left me
And it upsets me that I fail
But at the same time I know You will
Show me Your mercy, I ain't even worthy
I'm lower than derpy, but You are for real
And I ain't gotta worry 'bout You leavin' me broken
And I ain't gotta worry 'bout You leavin' me hopeless
You are what hope is, and I put hope in You alone
I want the world to know this

[Chorus: Shuree Williams]
And I'll show the world
You're the only One for me
You're the only One for me
(4x)

[Bridge: Shuree]
Woah woah, I'll shout it
Woah woah, the mountains
Woah woah, don't doubt it
That I am Your's
