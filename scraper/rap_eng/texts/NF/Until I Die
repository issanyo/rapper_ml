[Intro]
Yeah
Record four
Let's go
Yeah, it's record number fo'!
'Errybody knows
Yeah!
I'ma let it, I'ma let it, I'ma let it go
I'ma let it go
Yeah
Listen!
Oh, no! Yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't the type to take a gat and put a hole in your head (nah!)
I'm the type that take the mic and clean your soul up instead (yeah!)
What I say and what I write is motivation, forget it
You want a Shady number two, man that's not what this is (not what!)
It's like we all take sin and adapt it
Used to seem ugly, now it's lookin' attractive (real pity)
Used to let it bug me, now we like it when it happens (crazy)
It's like when it happens (nah!), your life is inactive (yeah!)
World's satisfaction will play with your mind
Got you think you're gettin' 'head, but your fallin' behind
Yo, DMX said, "Lord, send me a sign"
Read a little Revelation, and that's what you gon' find
See, in every line, I present you with facts
And yo, in every rhyme I desire to impact you (thank you)
Go inside of your mind
I rewind and go back to a place or a time
You traveled off of the map
Do the math, yeah
Money put a smile on your face
Same thing that make you smile will make your smile go away (yeah!)
See, the riches of the world might get you the chains and Nike's
But in the end, neither one of those'll save your life

[Chorus]
Until I die
I'ma take my hopes and dreams
And use 'em to glorify His Name
Until I die
I'ma rep the one true God
And I don't care 'bout what nobody say
Until I die
I'ma spread the truth to this nation
And show 'em there's a God that can save 'em
Until I die
And here I take my last breath out of my chest
I'm gon' praise Him

[Verse 2]
MTV knows how to get the alley-oop (yeah)
All they gotta do is mix a little lie with some truth
Come out here, girl! Let me fix that face up
Need a little less clothes and a lot more makeup (haha!)
Get all caked up
Oh no, here we go
Another episode, skippin' down the Hollywood road (haha!)
Where you goin'? Nobody knows, nobody cares
Then you wonder why the girls around the world insecure (yeah)
It's so stupid
You want the truth, kids?
The media's just one big lie of losin' (come on!)
It's like I'm watchin' a movie, world's so full of actors (actors!)
Take a moment listen to me, I'm not actin'
I'm just askin'
Tell me if you're ready to die (nah)
If it happened today, where would your soul reside?
Devil laugh 'cause he know how to play with your face
So I just laugh back and pick up the mic and I say

[Chorus]
Until I die
I'ma take my hopes and dreams
And use 'em to glorify His Name
Until I die
I'ma rep the one true God
And I don't care 'bout what nobody say
Until I die
I'ma spread the truth to this nation
And show 'em there's a God that can save 'em
Until I die
And here I take my last breath out of my chest
I'm gon' praise Him

[Verse 3]
I'd rather die today for what I believe in (come on)
Than die a hundred years from now for no reason (well, why?)
Atheists are like, "I don't know why I'm breathin'
Yeah, there's gotta be a reason, but there's no Jesus" (haha)
Standin' up screamin', "He's not real!" (he's fake!)
Honestly, I'm sorry that's the way y'all feel (fake!)
World's kinda like, to me, just a roller coaster
You in it for the ride? Well, what's up when it's over? (yeah, yeah)
You keep doin' wrong when you know it ain't right (yeah)
How you live today, it turns eternal life (eternal life)
You let it slip away, and it's gon' blast you
Keep the sin up in your face, then the truth gon' pass you
My momma used to tell me I should follow my dreams (come on!)
But most of my life I just been followin' me (yeah!)
So I'ma take this moment to release my shine
And yo, forget about me
Let His will be done, man, not mine

[Chorus]
Until I die
I'ma take my hopes and dreams
And use 'em to glorify His Name
Until I die
I'ma rep the one true God
And I don't care 'bout what nobody say
Until I die
I'ma spread the truth to this nation
And show 'em there's a God that can save 'em
Until I die
And here I take my last breath out of my chest
I'm gon' praise Him
