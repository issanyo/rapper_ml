[Verse 1]
You put your hand into mine, and baby we flew
And whenever you're not around I don't know what to do
And I'd rather die than go on living without you
You're the one for me
You're the one for me

[Hook]
You're the only one, only one
Nothing's gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it

[Verse 2]
I put my hand into yours, and baby I knew
That you would be there no matter what we go through
You're not alone. I'll always be there for you
Cause you're the one for me
You're the one for me

[Hook]
You're the only one, only one
That is gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it

You're the only one, only one
That is gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it


[Verse 3]
Girl, I don't want to sound like I'm on repeat
I know that it sounds like it might seem weak
Been through too much, I know it ain't easy
To look at my face, it's difficult when you see this
Hey we been falling apart and we've been trying to fix this
I'm hoping and wishing that things will be different
I don't want to lose you, I know that I miss this
Cause you're the only one on my mind I listen to

[Bridge]
Trying to be the man that you need, I need time
And I know that it seems I don't try
But I promise I won't lie, Won't lie
Every time I look in your eyes, Your eyes
Girl, I get this feeling that I never had
And I just want you to understand

[Hook]
You're the only one, only one
That is gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it

You're the only one, only one
That is gonna hold us up
I got you and after all that we've been through
We've been through some things
But it's okay, okay
There's no way I'm leaving
Baby believe it
