[Intro]
Yeah
I'm looking for that overdose
Heh
Yeah

[Verse 1]
When I say I want that overdose, it ain't about the drugs
I'm talkin' 'bout the Holy Ghost  runnin' through my blood
I'm lookin' for that overflow, somethin' I can love
You think the show's over? Oh no, it's just begun (c'mon)
You can call me special feature, yeah it's nice to meet ya
But my name is not what I came to teach ya
Yo, I know a God who can save ya, won't leave ya
He don't show His face, well He don't really need to
I give Him the glory for everything I have
He's more than just a story or something of the past
I ain't afraid to talk about it, ain't afraid to act
See, I'm just being me, man, and I don't need a mask
You all about the fast life, livin' for the money
A lot of people act like rap, tight gunnin'
Runnin' from the cops, see, to me that's nothing
But according to you, yeah, that might mean somethin'
That's why I give it to you in a form you understand
Cause sometimes in life things never go as planned
And sometimes you might feel like there's no chance
Quit tryna control it and just put it in His hands
You feel me?

[Hook]
He could be your comfort when you're broken
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow
He could be your Savior, be your friend
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow

[Verse 2]
If God's so real, why the world so crazy?
The rape rate climbin' and girl's havin' babies
Murders in the streets, murders in the schools
If God really cared He wouldn't let the pain pursue
But a lot o' y'all are lookin' from the wrong angle
And overdose in sin, and hey, your whole life tangles
You look in the Bible, even Satan was an angel
That just goes to show what lust for power will create you
Into something crazy, into something pitiful
You don't want the truth now, you'll get it at your funeral
Some think it's a joke, overdose, keep laughing
Ain't gon' be so funny when you layin' in your casket
God, He can save you; I ain't tryna play you
I'm just tryna represent the one and only Savior
Lies of the world will leave you like a broken heart
Hey, you lookin' for the same thing that tore you apart

[Hook]
He could be your comfort when you're broken
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow
He could be your Savior, be your friend
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow

[Verse 3]
God could be your overdose, so let me explain it
Ye ain't got the picture yet, you got the wrong paint
Now I know I'm hittin' you with a lot of information
But what I'm tryna do is introduce you to a Savior (Jesus)
I worship a God that made the world in six days
I worship a God that will never turn away (turn away)
I worship for truth, yeah, I worship for faith
And even if you kill me, you couldn't take that away
I'm livin' for that overdose, someone get me high
I'mma represent Him with my flow until I die
Devil say you're hopeless, it's just all up in your mind
I'd rather die for truth than live forever for a lie

[Hook]
He could be your comfort when you're broken
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow
He could be your Savior, be your friend
I'm lookin' for that overdose, yeah
I don't care, let it overflow

[Outro]
He could be, He could be your comfort
He could be, He could be your Savior
