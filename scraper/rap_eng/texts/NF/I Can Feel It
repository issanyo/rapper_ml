[Chorus]
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it
Yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it
Yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it
Oh yeah
I can feel it, I can feel it
I don't know, yeah
I don't know

[Verse 1]
Used to drive a car that ain’t running right
Overheats in the day, so I drive at night
And I know it sounds funny but it’s real life
Yeah, I know it sounds funny but it’s real life
I'm pulled over 'cause I'm dyin' at a red light
I thank God for the hard times
'Cause I guarentee without him I wouldn't be here
Let's be clear
I was given two cars, I ain't really outta money
Tryna rap, makin' $9,000 a year
I don't say it so you feel for me
I say it 'cause it's real to me
I go to my grandma's, hoping she can make a meal for me
Now I got some labels on the tables
Saying that they got a deal for me, ah!

[Chorus]
I can feel it, I can feel it
(I can feel it)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Oh yeah, yeah)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Oh yeah, yeah)
I can feel it, I can feel it
You know, you know, you know
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Oh yeah)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Oh yeah)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Oh yeah)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Yeah)

[Verse 2]
In Michigan, them winters cold
We wouldn't wanna turn on the heat, keep the bills low
We sitting in the living room in our winter coats
Yeah, we sitting in the living room in our winter coats
Me and my room-mate, we like "they don't know!"
Driving around town in the Grand Prix
People telling me that I should get a Plan B
Snow on the windshield, can't see
Tryna work 6:00 in the morning, that's me!
Sometimes I miss all those memories
They pop up back in my mind like, "remember me"
Records stop selling, these people won't care for me
The older you get, the more family is everything!

[Chorus]
I can feel it, I can feel it
(I can feel it)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(I can feel it)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(I said, I can feel it)
I can feel it, I can feel it

[Bridge]
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Oh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
I can feel it, I can feel it
I said, I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it, I can feel it
I said, I can feel it
I can feel it
Oh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Yeah!

[Chorus]
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Yeah!)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Yeah!)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Been a long time coming!)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Been a long time coming!)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Here we are!)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Yeah, I said, here we are!)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(Oh, yeah)
I can feel it, I can feel it
(I said, I can feel it)
I can feel it, yeah!
