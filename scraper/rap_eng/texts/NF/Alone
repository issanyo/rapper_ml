[Intro: NF]
Yo, to be honest, I feel completely alone
Like nobody knows me
Nobody understands me
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, it's kinda like this
Check it out

[Verse 1: NF]
I'm a little bit numb, little bit frozen
A walking emotion, but nobody knows it
Nobody knows me
I'm lost and I'm caught in a cold dream
But they don't see that I'm walkin' around so boldly
'Cause nobody out there knows these
Thoughts in my mind, am I wastin' my time?
I know, I won't survive; hold me
'Cause I'm bleedin' to death
I got these holes in my chest
I feel like no one respects the fact that I'm up to my neck
I've done my best, but still, yet it seems like I'm out in the cold
Look at me froze; here on my own
Please, don't let me die here alone

[Chorus: Sean Simmonds]
I cannot face this alone
I can't get by on my own

[Verse 2: NF]
Lost in the moment
Life in a coma
Lyin' around, see my life getting colder
I'm alone, but I go nowhere
Living in a prison in my mind; so scared
I don't wanna be this way, nah
I don't wanna feel this way, nah
I don't wanna die this way
Why am I this way?
Wish I had wings so I'd fly away
Nothin' around me, up where the clouds be
I'm the real definition of drowning
My pain and my head keeps pounding
How's he even living in the state he's at?
Left the pain, swear I'd never go back
But it's right here and it's quite clear that it's not leaving
Does anybody hear me?

[Chorus: Sean Simmonds]
I cannot face this alone (I need You) (I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You) (I need You)
I cannot face this alone (I need You) (I need You)
I can't get by on my own (I need You) (I need You)

[Verse 3: NF]
I was a little bit numb, little bit frozen
Kinda hard to see when your eyes ain't open
How you gonna breathe when your sin keeps chokin'
You to the point that you feel hopeless?
Hopin' things will turn around
Kinda hard to fly when you layin' on the ground
Jesus is the only reason any of us breathin'
Yeah, so don't get down
You ain't gotta live your life in the cold
Thinkin' nobody out there knows
What you been through, where you been to
Yeah, you ain't gotta live alone
He's Messiah, He's Creator
There ain't no one out there greater
Forget about them haters, accept Christ and make a change-up
Yeah, 'cause you ain't gotta die this way
Let Him wipe them tears right from your face
Life's a dream
So you better get back on track; in other the words, I'm saying:
Give Him your pain, give Him your hurt
Faith is way more than just going to church
Making your money and going to work
You don't give it to God? You'll watch everything burn, yeahh
And this ain't no game
Living without Him is just so insane
People, they livin' for money and fame
Things never change 'cause we living the same
I don't wanna be alone; hate the cold
I'm so broken, I'm so froze
But no longer
'Cause I got my Jesus, and he makes me stronger

[Outro: Sean Simmonds]
Yeah, woo!
I can not face this alone (I need You, Lord) (I need You, Lord)
I can't get by on my own (like the fly what meets the rain, I need You)
I can not face this alone (alone) (I need You)
I can't get by on my own (Lord, I'm here) (Lord, I'm here)
Beggin' You, beggin' You, please
I'm down on my knees
I need You, I need You
Ay, oh, I need You, I need You
Lord, I can't make it without You, make it without You, no
No, Lord, I can't make it without You, make it without You alone
