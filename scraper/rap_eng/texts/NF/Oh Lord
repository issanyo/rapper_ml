[Verse 1]
When I die, put my ashes in a trash bag
I don't care where they go
Don't waste your money on my gravestone
I'm more concerned about my soul
Everybody's gon' die
Don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder…

[Chorus]
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"

[Verse 2]
Listen! Yeah, everybody wants change
Don't nobody wanna change though
Don't nobody wanna pray
'Til they got something to pray for
Know everybody's gon' die
But don't everybody live though
Sometimes I look up to the sky
And wonder…

[Chorus]
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"

[Verse 3]
It's easy to blame God, but harder to fix things
We look in the sky like, "Why ain't you listening?"
Watchin' the news in our livin' rooms on the big screens
And talking 'bout, "If God's really real, then where is he?"
You see the same God that we're sayin' might not even exist
Becomes real to us, but only when we dyin' in bed
When you're healthy, it's like, we don't really care for Him then
Leave me alone God, I'll call you when I need you again
Which is funny, everyone will sleep in the pews
Then blame God for our problems like he's sleeping on you
We turn our backs on him, what do you expect him to do?
It's hard to answer prayers when nobody's prayin' to you
I look around at this world we walk on
It's a smack in the face, don't ever tell me there's no God
And if there isn't then what are we here for?
And what are y'all doing down there? I don't know, Lord

[Chorus]
"(Do you see us? Oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"
"Do you see us down here, oh Lord (oh Lord, oh)? Oh Lord?"

[Outro]
Do you see us down here, oh Lord?
Can you see us down here, oh Lord?
Oh Lord, oh Lord
Can you see us?
Can't you see us?
