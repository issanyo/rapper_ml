[Chorus]
'Cause I've been there
And I know how it feels to lose your way
And lose the real you once knew existed
And I know
I know how it feels to go astray and feel the pain
You feel like something's missing

[Verse 1]
I've been there
The enemy is wearing me thin
I called your name, God
Guess you didn't hear me again
I keep praying to you
Seems like you don't want me to win
Want me to lose, 'cause
I feel like you're offerin' sin
To me on a silver platter
So my mind it get lost
Not just a little bit, I'm seein' all that I want
So I take it, thinkin' that my pain will dissolve
Back to square one, now I ain't got nothin' at all
What should I do?
How should I react when
Everything I thought that wouldn't happen happened?
All my dreams out by the road where the trash is
Something's missing but I don't know how to grab it
I know that you see me, but I don't feel your presence
And somethin' in my heart is startin' to get infected
I'm startin' to fall apart
Headin' in a direction
Opposite of the stars
Oh yeah
And did I mention I've been there?

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been there
And I know how it feels to lose your way
And lose the real you once knew existed
And I know
I know how it feels to go astray and feel the pain
You feel like something's missing

[Verse 2]
Satan's a liar
I hate the way he lures me in
Forget the Bible, I'd rather take a sip of this sin
And once I take a sip of it, I realize that I went
Over the edge, so I repent and then I do it again
Look at me go like the true buckram in my funeral
Black tie, black suit, now isn't it beautiful?
Uh huh
In other words, I'm tryna say that I'm dead
Don't know what's missin' but I'm pullin' hairs outta my head
Tryin' to grasp it
God what am I lackin'?
Whatever it is, I know I gotta have it
I'm fallin' harder than I ever imagine
I say I'm givin' my best, but I know that I haven't
It's tragic
You're knockin' at my door but it's locked
What's wrong with me, Doc?
I don't think this pain's gonna stop
Ain't you ever thought, Nathan, maybe it's not what's in your heart already
It's what you ain't got

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been there
And I know how it feels to lose your way
And lose the real you once knew existed
And I know
I know how it feels to go astray and feel the pain
You feel like something's missing

[Verse 3]
Lord, forgive me
Please fill this hole in my heart
I got a life full of cracks, and I'm fallin' apart
Lord, forgive me
I need you to make me clean
So when they look, they see you and not just me
Lord, forgive me
Please fill this hole in my heart
I got a life full of cracks, and I'm fallin' apart
Lord, forgive me
I need you to make me clean
So when they look, they see you and not just me
Fill me up
I'm amped and I'm ready to go
Fill me up
I don't care if it's outta control
Fill me up
To the point that I'm so full that I'll be livin' and breathin' to get more
Fill me up
I'm amped and I'm ready to go
Fill me up
I don't care if it's outta control
Fill me up
To the point that I'm so full that I'll be livin' and breathin' to get more

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been there
And I know how it feels to lose your way
And lose the real you once knew existed
And I know
I know how it feels to go astray and feel the pain
You feel like something's missing
'Cause I've been there
And I know how it feels to lose your way
And lose the real you once knew existed
And I know
I know how it feels to go astray and feel the pain
You feel like something's missing
