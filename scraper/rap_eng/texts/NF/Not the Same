[Chorus]
(Yeah)
(Ooohh, yeah)
Sometimes I look out the window of my life
And I can see you
I can see you there
Yeah (yeah), oh
Sometimes I like to pretend like I'm not scared
Like I don't need you
I don't need you here, no (yeah)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I don't deserve it
I ain't even worthy
Yet you give me water when I tell you that I'm thirsty
Still I take some things in life that really wanna hurt me
I say I'm livin' clean but I be livin' dirty
Back and forth swervin' like it don't mean nothin'
I'm married to my sins so I treat it like I love it
I kiss it and I hug it and don't put nothin' above it
You tell me to just let it go, I say that I ain't budgin'
I rather be a killer, be a sinner, be a liar
I make my own wings, yeah
That's how I'm flyin'
It's all about me, I don't see that I'm blinded
And one day I'ma wake up and wonder where all my time went
I just

[Chorus]
Sometimes I look out the window of my life
And I can see you
I can see you there
Yeah (yeah), oh
Sometimes I like to pretend like I'm not scared
Like I don't need you
I don't need you here, no (yeah)
Yeah

[Verse 2]
You gave me a gift, God, I ain't gon' waste it
I don't want the whole world, I just wanna taste it
I just want a little bit, you know, somethin' basic
What's wrong with doin' drugs, gettin' high, and gettin' wasted?
You tell me to face it, but I can't confront it
I look at my problems that turn around runnin'
I don't like what I'm becomin'
And even though I say that
Once I get away from it, I know I'ma stray back
Sick of wakin' up, wondering where my faith at
Told you I'm a liar, that's probably why I hate facts
Nevertheless, as I look out this window today and see your outstretched arms and tears on your face
I realize, God, really need your help
I ain't been livin' for you, Jesus, I been livin' for myself
Been caught up in the world and caught up in the sin
Time to unlock the door, kill my pride, and let you in

[Outro]
Sometimes I look out the window of my life
And I can see you
I can see you there
Yeah (yeah), oh
Sometimes I like to pretend like I'm not scared
Like I don't need you
I don't need you here, no
And now I raise my hands for the Son of Man
You're all I neeeeed, yeah
And now I praise your name
Lord, take everything
You're all I seeeee, yeah
I'm not the same as I used to be
Yo, you wanna see a change, there's a change in me
I'm just tryna make you understand, basically
I'm not the same, I'm not the same
I'm not the same as I used to be
Yo, you wanna see a change, there's a change in me
I'm just tryna make you understand, basically
I'm not the same, I'm not the same
No, no, no
Sometimes I look out the window of my life
And I can see you
I can see you there
Yeah (yeah), oh
