[Verse 1]
You say that you love me
Let's talk about it
And you swear that you'll always be there
I doubt it
When I look in those eyes
I can tell you're lying
All those tears that you cry
Why do you keep denying

[Chorus]
You say that you care but I know you're lying
Please spare me the tears
There'll be no sympathizing
I act like I'm fine
But you're antagonizing
My heart is falling apart

[Verse 2]
We lay in my bed, so irritated
All the things that we said
Yeah, it's so frustrating
Who am I to tell you that you're not perfect
It's just that I thought that you were a different person
We smile and pretend like nothing matters
When in fact, in the end, it just makes us madder

[Chorus]
You say that you care but I know you're lying
Please spare me the tears
There'll be no sympathizing
I act like I'm fine
But you're antagonizing
My heart is falling apart

[Verse 3]
I look at you now
Yeah what I used to see
Is breaking me down
Why ain't you like you used to be?
Still beautiful as ever, yet I feel no unity
Usually, I just feel like you're using me
You're telling me you love me, yeah, from the lips of your mouth
But honestly, honesty isn't what I think's coming out
Seems the people you love the most, push you down, let you go
That's why I'm here to let you know, we lie to people just for show
You pretend you care, but really it don't bother you
Wonder if it will when I decide to say goodbye to you
I'm trying to fix it, what you think I'm trying to do?
You don't like my attitude, then wonder why I'm mad at you
I've had enough of it
My heart, you ain't touching it
You say you're in love with it
But really, you're crushing it
I don't hate you, I'm just trying to understand how you feel
There ain't no point of continuing this if it ain't even real

[Chorus]
You say that you care but I know you're lying
Please spare me the tears
There'll be no sympathizing
I act like I'm fine
But you're antagonizing
My heart is falling apart

[Outro]
You say that you care
Please spare me the tears
I act like I'm fine
My heart is falling apart
