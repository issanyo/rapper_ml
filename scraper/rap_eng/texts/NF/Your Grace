[Intro]
Yeah
Sometimes I feel like
(Feeling like I lost my mind)
I'm as close as I've ever been to you
And then the next moment
(You are not a waste of time)
It's like I'm running from you
And I'm sorry
This is not how it's supposed to be
But sometimes that's how it happens
Forgive me
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I feel lost in my mind
Just another pain in my head
I feel so broken inside
With memories I'm tryna forget
I don't feel like I used to
Matter 'a fact not even close
I don't feel right
Yet I choose to
To go to a place I don't know
Maybe I'm crazy
Maybe I'm not
But I feel like I'm outta control
And God, I need you
Right now
I never should've let you go
Now I'm just so out of control

[Chorus]
And now I don't know who I am
This was never my plan
This ain't how it's supposed to be
I took it out of your hands
I took a chance
But how am I supposed to see
When I'm blinded
And when I'm broken
Lookin' for a way to escape
I can't find it
But then I'm reminded of your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Of your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
I thought I was fine
I guess not
If I was I wouldn't feel this way
If I was okay
And I was so perfect
Then why do I feel so ashamed
I'm no liar in my head
Screaming I don't need any help
I say I'm tryin', yet in the end
I'm only tellin' lies to myself
I say I want answers
Complaining
Yeah, I'm just looking for truth
Unless I got problems
Which I got 'em
I seem I only blame 'em on you, whoa
It's like I don't know what to do, whoa, yeah

[Chorus]
And now I don't know who I am
This was never my plan
This ain't how it's supposed to be
I took it out of your hands
I took a chance
But how am I supposed to see
When I'm blinded
And when I'm broken
Lookin' for a way to escape
I can't find it
But then I'm reminded of your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah)
Of your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
Lord, forgive me
I feel so cold
Livin' in the wrong
Yeah, here I go
I don't want to cry
I don't want to show all the emotion
I got froze
I don't know how say this easy
Look in the mirror but I don't see me
I don't see the things I used to know
Swore to myself
Never let you go
Here I go
Pain again
Here I go
Playin' pretend
Actin' like I'm fine
When in my mind I'm just breakin'
Lookin' for a reason
Wonder why I'm breathin'
Wonder why my momma had to die
Lord Jesus
I don't understand this
I ain't never planned it
My plan did never evolve
We feelin' trashed in
I feel like I keep falling down
Lord, please help me up
I've had enough

[Chorus]
And now I don't know who I am
This was never my plan
This ain't how it's supposed to be
I took it out of your hands
I took a chance
But how am I supposed to see
When I'm blinded
And when I'm broken
Lookin' for a way to escape
I can't find it
But then I'm reminded of your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah)
Of your grace
(Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah)
