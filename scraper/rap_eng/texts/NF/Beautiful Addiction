[Verse 1]
We're born in a storm
It started in a dream
And God made me realize
Life ain't what it seems
Selfishly inspired
A heart exposed
Hit me with a passion that brought me to my knees

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, anymore, no
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, anymore, no

[Verse 2]
Hearts healed
Eyes open wide
Paradigms shifted
Communities engaged
Vindicated by grace
God's now in control
I'm finally addicted to this beautiful change

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, no, no, anymore, yeah
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, no, anymore

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, oh, anymore, yeah
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be selfish
Anymore, oh, anymore

[Outro]
This is the time
This is the moment where everything changes
This is where I, I draw the line
I can no longer take it
This is the time
This is the moment where everything changes
This is where I, I draw the line
I can no longer take it (oooh)
This is the time (this is the time, this is the time)
This is the moment where everything changes (to change)
This is where I, I draw the line (this is the moment, ooh, yeah)
I can no longer take it (I draw the line, I can no longer take it)
