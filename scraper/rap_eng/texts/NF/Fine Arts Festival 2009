[Verse 1]
When it come to my music, I'm like the preacher
And y'all are in the classroom and I'm the teacher
God gave me the gift, so I can reach you
You give me a life, it ain't gon' never leave you
Rappers like to talk tough in they wife-beaters
Think they hot when they not, they ain't got Jesus
I don't wanna be the bearer of bad news, I will if I have to
Give the Devil a chance, guarantee he gon' smash you
Always like to bring up your past
I don't know what's dumber, the Devil or Soulja Boy rap, son
Yeah, but on a serious note
My God can save you, I'm being serious, yo
I used to live like I ain't got a reason
Talk about God, I's like I don't really need 'em
Knew He's right in front of me but I didn't wanna see 'em
Now I realize I'm nothing without Jesus

[Chorus]
I got Jesus, and nothing in this world is comin' between us
I'ma let it out, this ain't no secret
So everybody put your hands up and scream it, yeah
I got Jesus, and nothing in this world is comin' between us
I'ma let it out, this ain't no secret
So everybody put your hands up

[Verse 2]
You're confused like you don't know what I'm talking about
Genesis 1:1, ay, pull your Bibles out
You don't get it yet? Yeah, you can't see
Scientist will land on the moon, but they can't read
My God is magnificent; world is twistin'
The atheists are like little kids, "I ain't listenin'"
People caught up in them things of the world
Want the money, want the fame, got my chain, want the girls
Seems crazy to me, basically
I find it funny that money's become a god so bleak
Thinkin' 'bout, makes me laugh
Why would you wanna worship something I can rip in half?

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got Jesus, and nothing in this world is comin' between us
I'ma let it out, this ain't no secret
So everybody put your hands up and scream it
I got Jesus, and nothing in this world is comin' between us
I'ma let it out, this ain't no secret
So everybody put your hands

[Verse 3]
A lot of people live they lives so powerless
Give their life to the Devil, he devours it
You look closer and, Satan, he's a coward, kids
Give your life to God, He'll show you what power is, yeah
What I gotta do to make you see my God died in one day but rose in three?
Supposedly, soldiers said they fell asleep
Nah, God knocked them off of they feet, nah
Keep thinking that you fly with your money
While you're rollin' in your Corvettes chillin' with the honeys
Quit living for the chicks and pieces and give your life over to the one true Jesus

[Chorus]
Yeah, I got Jesus, and nothing in this world is comin' between us
I'ma let it out, this ain't no secret
So everybody put your hands up and scream it, come on!
I got Jesus, and nothing in this world is comin' between us
I'ma let it out, this ain't no secret
So everybody put your hands up and scream, "Yeah, I got Jesus"
