[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen
Welcome to tonight's show
Next up, we have one of the greatest
You know who he is
Hello

[Verse 1]
Whoops! I must be losin' it
They don't make medicine for as
Sick as my music is
Got no time for foolishness
Who do you think you're foolin' with
I been doin' this ever since I really knew what music was
My music's a
Well, how should I describe it?
I take a rhyme then I make it shine
In your face like a diamond
I'm in a position in which I shed light 'til it blind ya
Comes a time when your life
This show your dream look
Look what the time is
Why is everytime somebody's bein' themselves
Somethin' comes along
Like TV says to be someone else
Just bein' myself
Oh Nathan, look what you've done
Got no weapons or guns
Shoot, I'm probably white as they come
Got you on the run
Yes, I guess I'm out of my mind
Only time I've ever murdered
Is when I'm writin' these rhymes
God's what I'm on
I ain't smokin' dope to get famous
One of the greatest
Like fifty cents, you can love it or hate it

[Hook 2x]
Yeah Yeah
I got the Lord with me
Yeah Yeah
I got the Lord with me
I got the Lord with me
This ain't a game to me
Put your hands up if you feel the same as me

[Verse 2]
911, what's your emergency?
Some white boy with a microphone just lyrically murdered me
We've had that call six times this weeks
And we still can't find him yet
So you're gonna have to find a hole
And probably just climb in it
His rhymin' is so ballistic
It's hard for us to track him
And we're so far behind
I don't think we're gonna catch him
He's got that Jesus in his music
Which to us is crazy
Cause he ain't gonna make no money
Talkin' about that Jesus baby
Maybe
I'm back like you ain't never seen me
Grabbin' a mic make this look so easy
Chessy rappers are runnin' around
Talkin' about they're wearin' a crown
I'm wearin' them down
Don't believe me? Fine
That white boy that should be signed
Above your mind
With every single lyric
Every single rhyme
Some people look at you
And think you're just a joke or nothin'
Some people see me probably think
That boy is smokin' somethin'
I ain't smokin'
I'm just out of control
Here we go
Q-Quit pretendin' you don't already know

[Hook 2x]
Yeah Yeah
I got the Lord with me
Yeah Yeah
I got the Lord with me
I got the Lord with me
This ain't a game to me
Put your hands up if you feel the same as me

[Verse 3]
When I come through
I'mma get you movin' back
Better than ever baby
You know how I do it
Christ in the music
Yeah, that's me
Quit waitin' for me to change
That's how it's gonna be
Ain't about the money
I would rather have my family close
Sounds sweet little somethin' like candy
Yeah
And that's the way I roll
Like Lecrae said
"You either go hard or go home"
I ain't playin' with ya
Spit it like a preacher
Welcome to the show boy
I'mma special feature
Moment of slow stuff
Comin' out your speakers
I make you go crazy
Go crazy
Let me see you move
Yeah Yeah {3x}
Let me see you move {2x}

[Hook 2x]
Yeah Yeah
I got the Lord with me
Yeah Yeah
I got the Lord with me
I got the Lord with me
This ain't a game to me
Put your hands up if you feel the same as me
