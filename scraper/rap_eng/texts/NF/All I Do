[Chorus]
This is all I do, this is all I do
This is all I do, this is all I do (oh)
This is all I do, this is all I do
This is all I do, this is all I do, oh

[Verse 1]
I just put a hundred in the bank
I don't mean a hundred thousand
Haha, yeah, yo, I mean a hundred dollars
They say that I got no humor in music, then why am I smiling?
Why am I smiling, you do not feel it? (woo!)
Why are you lying?
You know somebody that's iller than me?
I wanna meet 'em
I wanna meet 'em, enough with the talking, woo!
I wanna see 'em!
I do not look at these rappers out here like I wanna be 'em
I look at these rappers out here like I wanna beat 'em
I am competitive, always been that way
Always been that way, that'll never change
Fans hit me up on my Instagram, like, "You've been singing too much"
Then the moment I stop you gon' write me and say I ain't singing enough!

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like LeBron (yeah!)
I feel like LeBron (they don't know, they don't know)
I feel like LeBron (woo!)
This is all I do, this is all I do, this is all I do

[Chorus]
This is all I do, this is all I do (this is all I do, woo!)
This is all I do, this is all I do, oh
This is all I do, this is all I do (this is all I do, woo!)
This is all I do, this is all I do

[Verse 2]
I have been at this for years, this didn't fall on my lap
I get so personal with you, you feel like you know me
You feel like we met
Fans getting into the music, relating, woo!
Tell me what's doper than that (nothin'!)
How you gon' say you the best in the game when you sound like you don't even know how to rap? (hahaha!)
I used to hand out my demos at shows, like, "Listen to me" (real life)
This ain't what it seems
I never sleep, which is funny, 'cause I'm out here living the dream
You say you livin' the dream, no, you just live in the dream
Y'all need to wake up, and get out of yo beds!
And quit sleepin' on me!
I got my head in the game, you know what that means?
(You know what that means?)
Oh yeah, you know what that means?
They got no clue, they got no clue
I thought I already told you before, this is all that I do, agh!

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel like LeBron (okay)
I feel like LeBron, I feel like LeBron
You don't it know by now, you don't it know by now?
What's wrong wit'cha?
I feel like LeBron
You don't know it by now?
This is all I do, this is all I do, woo! (yeah, yeah!)

[Chorus]
This is all I do, this is all I do (this is all I do, woo!)
This is all I do, this is all I do, oh
This is all I do, this is all I do (this is all I do, woo!)
This is all I do, this is all I do

[Outro]
What you know about that?
What you know about that? Nothin'!
What you know about that?
What you know about that? Nothin'!
What I know about that?
What I know about that? Somethin'!
What I know about that? Somethin'!
