[Intro]
(Ay, ay, ay)
(Ay, ay, ay)
(Ay, ay, ay)
(Ay, ay, ay)

[Chorus]
I'm ready (ay, ay, ay)
I'm ready (ay, ay, ay)
I'm ready (ay, ay, ay)
I'm ready (ay, ay, ay)

[Verse]
Yo, I ain't what you assume, so think twice
I guarantee that they don't have a clue what I think like
I might come across like a rebel, I see life
Out of the box, don't put into there, that I might
Start a revolution, break out of it, rewrite
The history that you made and take it to new heights
Every loss is a lesson, that's why I never lose fights
And I learn from my mistakes and I use 'em, that's my right
To tell you how I feel, whether you 'gon listen or not
You don't agree with it? Then you can listen and watch
You ain't in peace with it? How do you envision the plot?
I've taken everything I love and makin' it rock
You see, my mind doesn't work like your's does
When I fall down, I just stand up more tough
And I'm not afraid to die, I don't care if the war comes
To my front door, see I just open the door up

[Chorus]
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready
I'm ready

[Outro]
I'm ready
They won't break me—I might fall, but that won't change me
I'm ready
And you might pull me and take your shots, but you won't move me
I'm ready
They won't break me—I might fall, but that won't change me
I'm ready
And you might pull me and take your shots, but you won't move me
