[Verse 1]
I'll keep swingin' for the fences
It's like this heart is defenseless
Against the passion that's pumpin' through my veins
Blood, sweat, tears, it's a callin'
And if I can't walk, then I'm crawlin'
It might flicker, but they can't kill the flame

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop
I can't quit
It's in my heart
It's on my lips
I can't stop, no
I can't quit
It's in my heart, yeah
I'm all in

[Chorus]
Til the wheels fall off
Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
I will lift your banner high (hey!)
And til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days, ooh
I'll lay it all on the line
Til the day I die (woo!)
Til the day I die (woo!)
Til the end of the line
Til the day I die (woo!)
Til the day I die (woo!)
It's Your name I'll glorify
(Tell 'em, Tob!)

[Verse 2]
It's runnin' deeper than the ocean
This ain't religion, it's devotion
365, every minute, every day
So in the middle of the madness
They can stretch me out like canvas
But I ain't ever gonna fit in their frame

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop
I can't quit
It's in my heart
It's on my lips
I can't stop, no
I can't quit
It's in my heart, yeah
I'm all in

[Chorus]
Til the wheels fall off
Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
I will lift your banner high (hey!)
And til the walls crash in
For the rest of my days, ooh
I'll lay it all on the line
(Til what!?)
Til the day I die (woo!)
Til the day I die (woo!)
Til the end of the line
Til the day I die (woo!)
Til the day I die (woo!)
It's Your name I'll glorify
(Let's get it!)

[Verse 3]
Til I die and they put me in the coffin
Don't matter if I'm on the road or if I'm recordin'
What they think about me, that really ain't important
You know I'ma represent 'em, I ain't playin', can't afford to
I only got one life, but I get it though
This is not an act, not a movie, not a TV show
I don't know what "quit" means, I don't ever take it slow
You know I'm on the grind when I'm all up in the studio
I do it for the King, what you know about that?
Say you goin' harder, mmm, I doubt that
You say you doin' work, but you're asking where the couch at
How you doin' work when you asking where the couch at, huh?
God is not a crutch, you can't use Him when you wanna (wanna)
You only look to heaven when you goin' through some drama (drama)
When you're goin' through some problems, that's the only time you call Him
Guess I don't understand that life, wonder why?
'Cause I'm all in
Til the day I die

[Chorus]
Til the wheels fall off (hey!)
Til the spotlight fades
I will lift your banner high
I will lift your banner high (hey!)
And til the walls crash in (yes sir!)
For the rest of my days, Lord
I'll lay it all on the line
(Til what!?)
Til the day I die
Til the day I (woo!)
Til the day, til the day I die
Til the end of the line
Til the day I, uh, woo!
Til the end, til the end of the line
Til the day I die
Til the day I (woo!)
Til the day, til the day I die
Til the end of the line
Til the day I, uh, woo!

[Outro]
It's Your name I glorify (ooh)
It's Your name I glorify (ooh)
It's Your name I glorify
