[Verse 1]
Baby, I guess I don't understand
How did we let this slip through our hands?
We were so in love, and then we lost it all
And now it's over, now it's over
I know we said that we could just be friends
But I can no longer play pretend
Because the memories of us cloud my head
And I'm sorry, so sorry

[Chorus]
But, I have to say goodbye
Yeah, goodbye
I don't wanna say it
Nah, I don't wanna say it
I don't wanna say goodbye
Goodbye
But we have to
But we have to

[Verse 2]
And baby, I guess I can't comprehend
The fact that this could really be the end
I wish we could talk this out instead
But we've tried that
Haven't we tried that?
I'm doing my best to let this go
'Cause it's obvious that we're on different roads
You consume my mind when I'm alone
And I miss you
Oh, how I miss you

[Outro]
But I have to say goodbye (Why?)
Yeah, goodbye (I don't wanna do it)
Yeah, I don't wanna say it (I don't wanna do it right now)
Nah, I don't wanna say it (Yeah)
Yeah, I dont wanna say goodbye (I don't wanna say goodbye, no)
(Listen) But goodbye
(The fact is) But we have to (We have to)
(Baby) Baby, but we have to (But we have to)
