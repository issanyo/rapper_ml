[Intro]
Yeah
Now everybody's felt pain if you know what I mean
Every single one of us
So I'ma explain some of my pain
And some of y'alls
You know what I mean?
So listen, it goes like this
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm sick of lettin' pain in, it tear me to pieces
I know the church talks like "Yeah, give it to Jesus"
It's hard tryna give my pride up to God
Tryna tell my mind I'm fine but really I'm not
I act like I'ma be able to carry it
My mind gets a trip on my pain and it buries it
I talk it away like it'll never come back
Like the Devil's in my face sittin' right in my lap
Yellin' in my ear but I never gon' make it
Think I got it together but it feels like I'm breakin'
I'm patient, my prayer got me down on a knee
Yeah, this is when look out at the crowd and I say, listen!

[Chorus]
I don't know what you've been through
And I don't know where you been to, and listen
I don't know how you livin' your life
But you better get it together and give it to Christ, listen
I don't know what you've been through (c'mon)
And I don't know where you been to
I don't know how you livin' your life
But you better get it together

[Verse 2]
Look, I really need You to save me
The world nowadays got my mind goin' crazy
I think they known what pain is ever since I was a baby
Seein' you're all that I got, you're the matter, it made me
I was angry
Especially when I turn on the news
And another twenty kids are gettin' shot in the school
It's a truth, it's a mystery, yeah, and it's sad
How'd you like to have your life end in your history class?
When I look in the mirrors like I look in my past
Sometimes I wake up in life and I don't know where I'm at
You give it a chance, world will get the best of you
You give it a piece, it's gon' try to take the rest of you

[Chorus]
And I don't know what you've been through, and yeah
I don't know where you been to, and listen
I don't know how you livin' your life
But you better get it together and give it to Christ, listen
I don't know what you've been through
And I don't know where you been to, and yeah
I don't know how you livin' your life, listen

[Verse 3]
Now everybody's felt pain, gotten pushed to the floor
They got pushed to the point they can't take any more
But I know a Savior, take can save you, man
It ain't difficult, nah, it ain't that hard to understand, Jesus Christ
He came and died for your sins, He's knockin' at your door but y'all ain't lettin' Him in
Just give him a chance, man, He'll climb in your heart
'Cause if you don't, then the world's gonna tear apart, yeah
Guess that I can leave it at that
This ain't all about the money, it ain't all about rap
Just remember, man, that God can save you
Not the world, I'm talkin' about the God that made you

[Chorus]
Yeah, I don't know where you been to, and listen
I don't know how you livin' your life
But you better get it together and give it to Christ, listen
I don't know what you've been through
And I don't know where you been to, and listen
I don't know how you livin' your life
But you better get it together and give it to Christ, yeah
