[Intro]
Hey, welcome to reality
Yeah
Sometimes, we all get away from that real life
You know sit back and think about, "What if my life was like this?"
It's crazy
And when you think about it
Kinda like a dream
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 1]
Imagine a life where you ain't got no reason to cry
It ain't hard to tell the truth when there's no reason to lie
Picture everything bad that ever happened to you
Snap it in two then laugh at those that laughin' at you
Imagine your pain disappears like magic
Everything that ever hurt you never happened
Your dad never left, your mom never cried
Your relationships' perfect, and nobody dies
You feel far from reality yet
I do, so I'mma bring reality back
You never met your dad, gone since you was a kid
Matter fact, he left before you even cried in the crib
And you momma always cryin'
Startin' to mess with your head
To the world, you alive
But to yourself, you're dead
Look in the mirror, heart's so full of rejection
So you cock your fist back, then crack your reflection like

[Hook]
Yeah
I don't like the way that I feel
Lookin' for reality, but this ain't real
What am I supposed to say, yeah
I ain't supposed to feel this way
It's like
Yeah
I don't like the way that I feel
Lookin' for reality, but this ain't real
What am I supposed to say, c'mon
I ain't supposed to feel this way

[Verse 2]
Imagine everyone you knew respected you
Put your name up high when they mentioned you
Never talked about you bad behind your back
And what they say is what they do
And what they are is how they act
Imagine every girl you had never hurt you
And every guy you fell in love with didn't desert you
Every lie on the earth was real
And didn't mind really lettin' out the way they feel
But hold up
Let's slow it down for a minute
Oh no! Lies in your face
I don't get it
What happened? I must have been dreamin' again
Another fake friend in your face playin' pretend
Another liar
Yellin' it ain't nothin' but truth
All cryin', screamin', "I would never hurt you"
Yeah, like we ain't heard that befo'
You want the truth? What you think I'm rappin' fo' like

[Hook]
Yeah
I don't like the way that I feel
Lookin' for reality, but this ain't real
What am I supposed to say, yeah
I ain't supposed to feel this way
It's like
Yeah
I don't like the way that I feel
Lookin' for reality, but this ain't real
What am I supposed to say, c'mon
I ain't supposed to feel this way

[Verse 3]
Picture a man that never did nothin' wrong
Got beaten 'til most of His flesh was gone
Put thorns in His head while they laughed and mocked Him
Devil laughin' down in Hell like, "Yeah, I got Him"
Imagine nails goin' into your palms
Strapped to a cross
Soldiers strechin' your arms
Like a joke, people all gather around
"If you so powerful, then why don't you just come down?"
Your mother cryin' at your feet
Breathe your last breath
You want reality, man that's as real as it gets
The one true God came down to earth to die
Never committed a sin, yet He died for mine
And seems we all so caught up in the crazy life
Die for the world, then we'll know what crazy like
Gotta be blind homie if you can't see it
So think about it next time yeah before you scream it like

[Hook]
Yeah
I don't like the way that I feel
Lookin' for reality, but this ain't real
What am I supposed to say, yeah
I ain't supposed to feel this way
It's like
Yeah
I don't like the way that I feel
Lookin' for reality, but this ain't real
What am I supposed to say, c'mon
I ain't supposed to feel this way
