[Intro: Britt Nicole]
It feels like a tear in my heart
Like a part of me missing
And I just can't feel it
I've tried and I've tried
And I've tried

[Intro: NF]
Tears on my face I can't take it
If lonely is a taste then it's all that I'm tasting
Do you hear my cry?
I cry, oh

[Chorus: Britt Nicole & NF]
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?

[Verse 1: NF]
Just wrap me in your arms, in your arms
I don't wanna be nowhere else
Take me from the dark, from the dark
I ain't gonna make it myself
Put your arms around me
Put your arms around me
Let your love surround me
I am lost
I am lost

[Bridge: Britt Nicole & NF]
If I ain't got you here
If I ain't got you, I ain't got nothing at all

[Chorus: Britt Nicole & NF]
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me?
Can you hold me in your arms?
In your arms

[Verse 2: NF & Britt Nicole]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, I feel like it's just me, like it's just me
What it gon' take? What it gon' be?
I don't even know
(It's not just you)
But I'm lonely
Feeling like I don't even know me, I don't even know me
(I feel it too)
Gotta have you, gotta see you
(You're the only thing I have to think about
The only one I that can't live without)
I see you
(I need you, need you to hold me now)
