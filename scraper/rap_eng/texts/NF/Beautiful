[Hook]
There she goes
She's so beautiful
She's so beautiful, yeah
But she's so broke
She's so incredible
Wonder if she'll ever know

[Verse 1]
Yeah, Oh she lays in her bedroom
And she cries
Yeah she cries (whoa whoa)
And she feels depressed as
Tears fall from her eyes
From her eyes (whoa whoa)
All she wants is love
But she never finds it in herself (whoa whoa)
And she just feels broken
I can tell that she's hopeless looking for help (whoa whoa)

[Hook]
There she goes
She's so beautiful
She's so beautiful (whoa whoa)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible
I wonder if she'll ever know (whoa whoa)

[Verse 2]
She gets attention from every direction
But she doesn't care (whoa whoa)
She prays for protection
Scared of rejection
Is anyone there? (whoa whoa)
She used to laugh
But now she's crying
Sick of the pain (whoa whoa)
She puts on her mask
Pretends, and she acts like she's okay (whoa whoa)

[Hook]
And there she goes
She's so beautiful
She's so beautiful (whoa whoa)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible
I wonder if she'll ever know (whoa whoa)

[Verse 3]
There she goes again putting on that fake act
Hard to see the real her when she got that fake mask
Daddy left it, he ain't never came back
Tears her apart but, she would never say that
She wants love, but don't know where to get it from
It's hard to learn respect from a man that never gave her none
So she cries and she yelling in the mirror
Is anybody out there? Does anybody care?
And people think they know her, but they don't really have a clue
Working three jobs, yeah she's doing what she have to do
Getting stressed out, and boys say she's beautiful
But that don't really mean a thing if she don't believe it though
Insecurity starting to take over
She looking for warmness, but keeps getting colder
Yeah, I know ya tripping on your looks and such
But quit looking to world, and start looking up
God made you beautiful

[Hook]
And there she goes
She's so beautiful
She's so beautiful (whoa whoa)
But she's so broke
She's so incredible
I wonder if she'll ever know (whoa whoa)
