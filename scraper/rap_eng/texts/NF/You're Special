[Intro]
Yeah, you, baby, you
You're something special
Baby, I know
I know what you're thinkin'
Maybe, maybe, I'm wasting your time
But I promise, but I promise
I know that I go back and forth
But I won't let you, I won't let you, I won't let you down
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I meant it when I told you I would change
Meant it when I told you I would stay
Sick of talkin' on the phone, babe
Time to pack your car and come to my state
Come to my place, look at my face, oh, yeah
You know I ain't playin'
I'm savin' some money, yeah, hop in the car
And get on the road, here we go
Baby, I can't lie
I'm a little bit, I'm a little bit scared right now, girl, girl, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you want more
And I can't blame you for
Askin' me for somethin' you deserve

[Chorus]
You're special
Yo-yo-you're special
Oh yeah, you're special
Yo-yo-you're special

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I knew it, you was my type
We ain't gotta skip to the highlight
You're the highlight, girl, of my life (woo)
Both of us have got a past, but it's alright
All night car rides
Drivin' through the city, yeah, the view's fantastic
It's automatic, could see you smile, gotta have it
She got me thinkin' maybe I'ma have to put a ring on it, girl
I ain't never been a romantic, but I can romance ya
Get your shoes on, baby, I am not asking
I'm 'bout to take you out to dinner, put the black dress on
Got the room gaspin', how did this happen?
I don't even know
She's the type to sing my words at the show
She's the type to pick me up when I'm low
And remind me she got my back, no matter what
Yeah, I think she hearin' me now
Say what I think, so I'm thinkin' out loud
I need a woman I know I can trust, and I got one
I guess you can say that she down
Callin' my phone, and she told me she proud
She said my name and I like how that sounds, oh, yeah
(I like that)

[Bridge]
I like how this sounds
(Baby, Iâ€”yeah)
Baby, don't make me lose myself
Baby, I need somebody I know I can trust (yeah)
I mean, I'm being honest
I ain't ever met a girl like you (no)
Baby, you can call me
You can call me anytime
You can call me any day, anytime
You know I'ma answer
I won't let you, I won't let you down, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you want more
And I can't blame you for
Askin' me for somethin' you deserve (you deserve it)

[Chorus]
You're special, yeah
Yo-yo-you're special
I said, girl, I said, you're special
I said, you're special
