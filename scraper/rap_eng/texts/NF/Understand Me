[Chorus]
It's obvious that they don't understand me
It's obvious that they don't see what I see
Yeah, they used to tell me I was crazy
Now they listen to me like, "Whoa, maybe"

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this is more than a dream, this is more than a passion
Don't ignore what you see—this is more than just rappin'
Here's a picture of me
Take a minute, now let's go backwards
To a time and a place when people thought that this would never happen
Sittin' in the back of the bus
Rappin' it up: my emotion
Ain't nobody really got a clue what I wanna do, and I'm like: my devotion
Don't go nowhere unless I got my CD player with me
Everybody lookin' at me like I'm nuts
"He ain't serious is he?"
Became a pain relief, called it my intervention
Little way to release my tension
Oh yeah, and did I mention?
Too all them kids that told me, "Nate, you just so overrated"
I took them haters and made them into my motivation

[Chorus]
It's obvious that they don't understand me
It's obvious that they don't see what I see
Yeah, they used to tell me I was crazy
Now they listen to me like, "Whoa, maybe"

[Verse 2]
I got lost in the movement, I got lost in the beats
Don't just talk to the music—music's talkin' to me
Don't make it hard, see, it really ain't that complicated
But people complicate it, let me clear the complication
Some said the music's fly
Some told me I was basic
Some say shoot for the sky
Some said, "You'll never make it"
Don't know what's in this mind, don't know my situation
Put my life in these lines, put my pain in these pages
Age twelve, walkin' around with a dream that no one knows
Ain't nobody else in my zone, just me and these headphones
Some people crack their jokes
Some people laughed at me
But in the end, he turned them dreams into reality

[Hook]
It's obvious that they don't understand me
It's obvious that they don't see what I see
Yeah, they used to tell me I was crazy
Now they listen to me like, "Whoa, maybe"
It's obvious that they don't understand me
It's obvious that they don't see what I see
Yeah, they used to tell me I was crazy
Now they listen to me like, "Whoa, maybe"
It's obvious that they don't understand me
It's obvious that they don't see what I see
Yeah, they used to tell me I was crazy
Now they listen to me like, "Whoa, maybe"
It's obvious that they don't understand me
It's obvious that they don't see what I see
Yeah, they used to tell me I was crazy
Now they listen to me like, "Whoa, maybe"

[Outro]
Yeah, a lot of people don't understand
A lot of people don't know
I been doing music since I was twelve, man
It's been a dream, it's been a passion for so long
And like I said, it's way more than that now
It's way more than just something I wanna be
This ain't about me just wantin' to be famous
Me about wantin' to make money
It's like, part of my life now, you know?
Yeah, let's go
