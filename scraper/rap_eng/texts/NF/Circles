[Intro]
(Yeah, we all make mistakes
Yeah, here's some of mine)
Yeah, it's my life
Lord forgive me (c'mon)
For the way I'm livin'
(I'm a sinner man, all of us are)
Lord forgive me
For the way I'm livin' (yeah)

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive me, I know I've made a lot of mistakes
When you look at my face you can tell I'm ready to break
Ready to snap, lost, where am I at?
I keep looking for light but why am I in the black
It's invisible I've been mixing and twisting the principles
There I go talking 'bout my life, how it's miserable
It's pitiful I live in this prison I been in through
Tryin' to minister when I'm the one that needs to be ministered to
Lord forgive me
I don't know why I do this
I betray You stab You in the back like Judas
Like Peter I deny You, like I don't know
Tears running down my face as the rooster crows
I'm a liar living in a world of 'em
I'm dyin' sins starting to fill my lungs
Oh no, I can hear the devil of my head
Great, Nate it looks like you're doin' circles again

[Hook] x2
It's like my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell

[Verse 2]
I wake up in the mornin'
My minds on me
Never said a prayer, Lord, never even noticed
Why am I so open to blaming when I'm broke
The moment I feel fine, I let the door close
Dealing with insecurity but not about myself
I'm having a hard time trusting anyone else
I treat you like a toy
So I put you on the shelf
Like I'll come play later if I need any help
And yeah I think you're calling but I don't really hear you
Seems I should be concerned with what I see in the mirror
What I see in the mirror's more than my apearance
I see anger eating away at my spirit
And maybe I should change, but I don't really want to
Unless I feel pain it's like I don't really want you
I know, by now it seems like I'd be smarter
The worst part is, now I'm right back where I started

[Hook] x2
It's like my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell

[Verse 3]
Father please, I know I don't deserve your grace
None of us do, yet, your mercy remains
You were perfect, there I go running away with nothing to say
Lord, I'm ready to change
Take me, and mold me into something that's right
Sick of living my life
Like I'm out of your light, I'm out of your sight
I need you to charge in
Take me out the darkness
And wrap me in your arms cause
Without you I'm just another phony
And without you it's like I don't even know me, show me
Pull me in the right direction
Need your life protection
Need the mic directed
I'm sick of living life like I ain't gotta have you
When in the end we both know that I have to
It's sad too
'Cause every time I'm falling away
I can hear the little voice inside my head say

[Hook] x2
It's my life is one big circle
I'm trying to go forward, but I'm in reverse still
It's like my life wants me to fail
Say I'm lookin' for heaven, but I'm headin' for hell
