[Intro]
You and I, we've been through a lot together
And I look back and I just, uh, I appreciate all the times that...that we had together, you know?
I remember just goin' down in my room and, you know, dealin'... tryna deal with some things
And you've always been there for that
Always, just me and you

[Verse 1]
You and I been best friends, ever since I was a young kid
Everything we did, where has time went?
Got a lot of years comin' up ahead of us and ever since we met
I knew we'd get somewhere, but the fact is I ain't really, I ain't really know when
I don't really know how either, but I can feel the goosebumps, my skin writin'
And I've been waitin' for the moment, you and I can make it happen
Lot of people think we ain't gonna make it rappin'
I ain't got a problem with 'em though, they don't even matter
We ain't lookin' for the people tryna say that we the baddest
No, I never liked that
Came a long way, never did it for the money
We ever make it big, I'ma give it to the family
Lookin' back now everything is lookin' funny
You and I in the room writin', up late when the mood strikes us
We don't care if they do like us
Writin' songs for the haters we ain't even got yet
Freestylin'? Somebody turn the mic up
Talkin' 'bout things we don't really understand
Talkin' 'bout things we don't really comprehend
Me and you tryna get it, we ain't quittin' 'til the end
Now I'm standin' on stage tryna give it to the fans, yah!

[Interlude]
We took that karaoke machine from my room and, uh, we put it up to the CD player and played the instrumentals
Man, we've come a long way
A long way

[Verse 2]
I made a lot of mistakes, you've been there for the whole thing
Help me with the drama
Rappin' in the car outside daily
We don’t care if it’s the winter, we don’t care if it's the summer
I remember writin' raps with the curse words
I just wanna hear it, seems like everybody does it
Did it for awhile wasn't into all the cussin'
Tried to find who I was, bein' everything I wasn't, real life, yeah!
Got a lot of anger, you know where I'm at, put it all over the pages
And wrote it into raps, said that we could be amazin'
If I give us a chance now I'm lookin' round like yeah, look at where we at
Look at where we at now, we ain't made it yet
But they can hear us in the background comin'
Some are gonna hate it, some are gonna love it
I'ma put it in His hands and let God do the judgin', yeah
Remember me and you, always had you in the backpack
Took you into school writin' on you like it's nothin', a lot of people in the room
See me scribble on a page but they ain't got a clue, nah, they ain't got a clue
We at the beginnin'
Hopin' someday you and I can say we made it and we did it
You ain't nothin' but a notepad to me, who you kiddin'?
I'm just runnin' out of space, I'll be back in a minute
Turn the page, homie

[Interlude]
You know what’s crazy is
This just started as somethin' that was an escape for us, you know?
And now I look around and there’s a lot of people out there goin' through the same things, you know, we've been through
Now this music we write is actually makin' an impact, it’s crazy

(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)
(Oh oh, oh oh)
