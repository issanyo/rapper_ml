[Verse 1]
When did I become so numb?
When did I lose myself?
All the words that leave my tongue
Feel like they came from someone else

[Chorus]
I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

[Verse 2]
When did I become so cold?
When did I become ashamed? (ohh)
Where's the person that I know?
They must have left, they must have left, with all my faith

[Chorus]
I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

[Bridge]
I'm paralyzed
I'm scared to live, but I'm scared to die
And if life is pain then I buried mine
A long time ago, but it's still alive
And it's takin' over me, where am I?
I wanna feel somethin', I'm numb inside
But I don't feel nothin', I wonder why
I'm in the race of life and time passed by
Look, I sit back and I watch it
Hands in my pockets
Waves come crashin' over me, but I just watch 'em
I just watch 'em
I'm underwater but I feel like I'm on top of it
I'm at the bottom and I don't know what the problem is
I'm in a box, but I'm the one that locked me in
Suffocatin' and I'm runnin' out of oxygen

[Chorus]
I'm paralyzed, where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things, I know I should
I'm paralyzed, where is the real me?
I'm lost and it kills me inside, I'm paralyzed

[Outro]
(I'm just so paralyzed) I'm paralyzed
(Yeah, I'm just so paralyzed) Where are my feelings?
I no longer feel things (I have no feelings)
I know I should (Oh, how come I'm not moving? Why aren't I moving?)
I'm paralyzed (Ay, yeah)
Where is the real me? (Where is the real me? Where is the real me?)
I'm lost and it kills me, (I'm paralyzed) inside (I'm paralyzed)
I'm paralyzed (I'm paralyzed)
