[Verse 1]
Maybe you and me could take a trip to the sky
Feels like I'm already there when I look in your eyes
Ay, listen, baby, I was thinkin' maybe
We could take a trip and go around the world
Wouldn't really matter where we at as long as you're my girl
Some say I'm crazy, but that don't faze me
You remind me of the sunshine when it's rainin'
Even if it's for a minute, I forget where my pain is
And that's for real, that's the way I feel
Got me feelin' so good every time you laugh
I wonder how we got here, how did this happen
I don't care, and baby girl I swear

[Chorus]
Baby, you and me are like the stars in the sky
Sometimes we look dim, sometimes we look bright
And that's okay, yeah
And that's okay, yeah
And baby, you and me are like the rain in the clouds
Sometimes we stay up, sometimes we fall down
And that's alright, yeah
And that's alright, yeah

[Verse 2]
But baby, hold up, I just gotta notice
You look kinda mad, was it something that I said?
'Cause you know I didn't mean it
Yeah, you know I didn't mean it
You look kinda upset, was it something I did?
If I had the chance then I would take it all back
But I don't
But I don't
I don't wanna sound like I think I'm perfect
'Cause that's not me
Yeah, that's not me
I don't wanna act like I'm that kinda person
Why can't you see?
Why can't you see, yeah?

[Chorus]
Baby, you and me are like the stars in the sky
Sometimes we look dim, sometimes we look bright
And that's okay, yeah
And that's okay, yeah
And baby, you and me are like the rain in the clouds
Sometimes we stay up, sometimes we fall down
And that's alright, yeah
And that's alright, yeah

[Verse 3]
I don't wanna sound like I'm jokin', yo
'Cause the point I'm at is emotional
Look at me go, talkin' about the pain I feel and the way, I don't
Wanna see you walk out that door
Can imagine not seeing you no more
But I guess I'm just gonna have to get used to it and just learn to cope
I don't know which way we're supposed to go
Lookin' for the pieces of our hearts, it's obvious we're broke
I'm so sick of the overload that's holdin' on them roll and go
Maybe we should turn around if we forget we ever--No
That would defeat the purpose, now wouldn't it?
And this relationship isn't how I envisioned it
This ain't how I pictured it, but I don't care
'Cause even when you're gone, it's like you're still here
So, I don't wanna hear about how this ain't workin'
And this relationship don't have no purpose
And maybe tomorrow we ain't gon' be feelin' the same
That's okay, as long as you know how I'm feelin' today

[Chorus]
Baby, you and me are like the stars in the sky
Sometimes we look dim, sometimes we look bright
And that's okay, yeah
And that's okay, yeah
And baby, you and me are like the rain in the clouds
Sometimes we stay up, sometimes we fall down
And that's alright, yeah
And that's alright, yeah
