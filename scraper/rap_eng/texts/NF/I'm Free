[Verse 1]
You in that tough place (yeah!)
You in that life prison
You at that rough stage but pretend your life isn't (quit pretendin'!)
I know a savior who can save you, take you out the chains
My God is major, can't contain it, gotta spread the name
Your life has got you low, (low!) that donÂ´t mean nothing
Let Him run the show (show!) and make you mean something
Wonder why you feeling broken, feeling empty
'Cause if you ain't got the Lord, you've never been free

[Chorus]
I don't feel chained no longer
Used to feel so weak, now I feel stronger (ayy)
What I got to do to make you see?
I been through the struggle and the pain, now I'm free
Yeah, now them weight's off my shoulders
Feeling brand new and I thought I done told ya
He got me out the place I was at, yeah
And I promise you, I ain't going back, baby

[Verse 2]
Free, now you know you trippin' majorly
Your eye gone off the ball like you playing in the major league
Making bad calls, striking out, livin' dangerously
Tryna steal bases, face it, think it's time to change your team
Basically, He can take your life and rearrange it
Say you want freedom, but you ain't ready for changes
He can flip your life around, somethin' like the Matrix
Used to feel chained up, now you feel amazing
Amen (uh-huh!)
You know that feeling like you're brand new (brand new)
No longer are you living like you can't move (can't move)
He took you out the bondage and he freed you
Instead of yelling: "Chained up!"
Now you yelling: "Freedom!"

[Chorus]
I don't feel chained no longer
Used to feel so weak, now I feel stronger (ayy)
What I got to do to make you see?
I been through the struggle and the pain, now I'm free
Yeah, now them weight's off my shoulders
Feeling brand new and I thought I done told ya
He got me out the place I was at, yeah
And I promise you, I ain't going back, baby

[Verse 3]
I want You to free me, Father
I'm so sick of the pain that bothers me
To the point I scream and holler
Lookin' for a way to get away, better wait to get away, no option
Gave me the ball, I dropped it
Had your plan in my palms, I mocked it
Told you I would give it all, but I'm not, so you gave me a chance
I blew it, I bombed it
See, I know I don't deserve it
But I don't wanna be this broken person
Living in the dark, no hope incurving
Losing all my heart, hopeless, nervous
Choking, burning, I hate these burdens
They break and torture me and they forcing me into something I know I was never born to be
But now I'm free

[Chorus]
I don't feel chained no longer
Used to feel so weak, now I feel stronger (ayy)
What I got to do to make you see?
I been through the struggle and the pain, now I'm free
Yeah, now them weight's off my shoulders
Feeling brand new and I thought I done told ya
He got me out the place I was at, yeah
And I promise you, I ain't going back, baby
I don't feel chained no longer
Used to feel so weak, now I feel stronger (ayy)
What I got to do to make you see?
I been through the struggle and the pain, now I'm free
Yeah, now them weight's off my shoulders
Feeling brand new and I thought I done told ya
He got me out the place I was at, yeah
And I promise you, I ain't going back, baby

[Outro]
I ain't going back, baby
I ain't going back, baby
