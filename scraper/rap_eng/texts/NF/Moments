[Intro]
Here I come, here I come
There I go, there I go
Yeah, I'm a dreamer (I'm a dreamer)
Here I come, here I come
There I go, there I go
Yeah, I'm a dreamer (I'm a dreamer)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, you all about the money (Ayy), I'm all about the dreams (Yeah)
All that cash talk, that don't mean a thing to me
See I don't run the streets (Nah), I don't run the hood
I'm spittin' real life, most y'all are Hollywood
I'm comin' with a flow that's crazy (Ayy)
Got your movement from the moments, y'all play me (What?)
Trust me you don't wanna mess with me, baby
I have you runnin' in circles (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Here I come with a flow so fly
Lookin' at me nuts like I lost my mind
Flow's so hot when write these rhymes
I ain't gonna stop, let it pass me by
You too slow, gang, in the rest, gang
With the base, get out of the way
I don't wanna lose you, but
I'm kinda in the mood to, what?
You thinkin' for a minute, homie, that you faster (Faster)
When it come to flow, we both know I already passed ya (Passed ya)
You like an apprentice in this game, I'm like the master (Master)
My lyrics are bullets, and I'm about to blast ya, have ya
Considered the person that you're dealin' with
All y'all ever talk about is how you makin' millions
See, that's the difference between me and you and this rap
Rather have my mama back than stack a hundred stacks
So I don't wanna make a scene but you don't know what it means to me
Grabbin' a mic has filled my dreams, this means everything to me
Basically, it's makin' me develop into what you see
What you see is all o' me, composin' around, so, follow me

[Chorus]
This is the moment of your life
You better grab it while you got the chance to
This is the moment of your life
You do what you wanna, I'mma do what I have to

[Hook]
Got me sayin'
Hey, hey, hey
And you got me sayin'
Hey, hey, hey
And you got me sayin'

[Verse 3]
Bob your head (Bob your head)
Get in the zone (Get in the zone)
Yeah, give it your all, just lose control
Another shot to prove all, you could extol
That's why I stay focused and keep my heart with the Lord
Tonight's make or break, what's yours to take
A moment of destiny, a moment of pain
I'll move the pace, no time to waste
Mind the line, how to win, let me demonstrate
Now take ambition, a moment's given
Have a heart that isn't finished
Slapped in the face, them heartless critics
Ha, now you with me
The things you say I never do
What else will I have to put with you?
Nevermind, let me take you back to school
Let me show you apes a thing or two
Fight for existence like black or blue
Mind the ball game and you'll get a clue
Head about to bust like you blow a fuse
Pay attention, don't get confused
To be the best, you can never rest
So we'll call it good cause you make the rest
Yeah, my heart's full of dreams that you can't accept
Came through the side, I got nothin' left
But I'm fine
I got my pride
I got my mind
That's all I need
I'm settin' bombs
Sorry, I got my self-esteem

[Chorus]
This is the moment of your life
You better grab it while you got the chance to
This is the moment of your life
You do what you wanna, I'mma do what I have to

[Hook]
Got me sayin'
Hey, hey, hey
And you got me sayin'
Hey, hey, hey
And you got me sayin'

[Bridge]
Here I come, here I come
There I go, there I go
Yeah, I'm a dreamer (I'm a dreamer)
Here I come, here I come
There I go, there I go
Yeah, I'm a dreamer (I'm a dreamer)
I'm a dreamer
Yeah, I'm a dreamer yeah (I'm a dreamer)
Oh, yeah, oh (I'm a dreamer)

[Chorus]
This is the moment of your life
You better grab it while you got the chance to
This is the moment of your life
You do what you wanna, I'mma do what I have to

[Hook]
Got me sayin'
Hey, hey, hey
And you got me sayin'
Hey, hey, hey
And you got me sayin'
