[Hook]
I wish, that I could leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where no one can find me
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could take parts of my past
Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape

[Verse 1]
Have you ever been so broke, or frozen, it's so cold
Emotions are so blown, hoping you won't go
Back to that war zone, the place that you don't know
It's hard to go the right way when you're on the wrong road
Feel like you're so low, you're 'bout to explode
And you'd do anything to get back what you let go
Stuck in upset mode, 'cuz you can't seem to figure this out
Living without a reason to live, thinking about
What you should have done, things that you could have changed
And maybe if you had then things wouldn't be this way
And you wouldn't feel this pain, but that's too easy now isn't it
Wishing that you could go back and things would be different
Got a time machine up in your mind
Wishing you could push a button and your life would unwind
But that's not how it happens, you can hope and imagine
Instead of looking forwards, lot of us looking backwards

[Hook]
I wish, that I could leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where no one can find me
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could take parts of my past
Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape

[Verse 2]
Have you ever been so lost, you feel like your hope's gone
And know you need to let go of some things but you hold on
Hoping and wishing that some things would be different
So you scream in your room, it feels like nobody's listening
You're mad so you scream louder, things that you're not proud of
Wishing you knew a way to escape but you don't know how the
Heck are you supposed to cope with something you can't let go
You get emotional, wonder if you'll ever know
Came to get lost in it, wishing back lost minutes
Your anger's involved in it, so you get engulfed in this
Pain that you come to hate, wishing you could escape
But you don't know where to run, it's written all on your face
Look at me losing control, I just don't know where to go
I'm getting lost in the mo-ment, look at me woah (Yeah)
I think it's time for me to escape
Time to relate, follow me as I put this pen to this page

[Hook]
I wish, that I could leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where no one can find me
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could take parts of my past
Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape

[Bridge]
I'm so sick of feeling
Like I don't have a clue what I'm doing
Like I don't have a clue what I'm doing
Yeah
And I'm so sick of feeling
Like I don't have a clue where I'm going
Like I don't have a clue where I'm going
Yeah

[Verse 3]
See all of us need a place, where we can go escape
Get away from the pain, be ourselves and just run away
But where are we running to, this lane we've been running through
Starting to get harder and it's starting to bother you
Some of us get depressed, some of us go to music
Some of us get stressed, others just push through it
So I'm gonna push through this, now and get lost in this
Escape and get lost in it, get ready we've all said it

[Hook]
I wish, that I could leave it all behind me
Go to my own world where no one can find me
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
And I wish, that I could take parts of my past
Hold on to the good and throw the rest in the trash
I guess it's just the way I escape, yeah
I guess it's just the way I escape
