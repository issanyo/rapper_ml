Know the talk is irrelevant, I'm a heck of a gentleman
I'ma do what you never did, take a microphone and show you why I'm miles ahead of you
Put a dent in it, I ain't playin', it's evident
I'm just doin' whatever everybody ever told me I never could, so intelligent, never tentative
Somebody call up Guinness'
I don't really care what your record is, I am wreckin' it
