[Intro]
Oh, I miss you
Whoa, I miss you
Now you're gone, yeah
Now you're gone
Oh, I miss you, yeah
Oh, I miss you
Oh, now you're gone, yeah, yeah
Now you're gone, no

[Verse 1]
I should have been there, told you that I loved ya
Held a little tighter as I kiss, and when I hug ya
I should have called ya, told you that I missed ya
Tears on my face as I'm lookin' at your pictures
Yeah, I'm with ya, but only in this mindset
Since you've been gone you ain't never left my mind yet
And I'm upset, not because of you
I wish all I remember was the good, I never do
I guess when you lose somethin', that's when you appreciate it
If you were here, then I'd show you my appreciation
But you're not, so I'mma have to learn to cope with it
Got a box of memories, but I'm scared to open it
I see you smilin', but only when I'm dreamin'
I know you're gone forever, but somehow I don't believe it
Somebody wake me up, my eyes closin'
I'm hopin' some day you'll be there when they open, but

[Chorus]
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now you're gone (And now you're gone)
And now you're gone (And now you're gone)
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you (And I miss you)
Oh, I miss you (Oh, I miss you)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I wish you can hear me, I know you don't
And I wish you would call me, I know that you won't
But why I gotta cry? Sick o' dwellin' on the negative
Use what you love, it'll will take you where you never been
Yo, depression, naw, far from it
Have I cried? Oh, yeah, I've done it
If I could I'd change, and I'd go back
Problem is if we could, yeah, we'd all do that
I can see you laughin' in my memories
Sad part is that's the only thing I'll ever see
Used to wear a tough face and play pretend
Now the fact is I'm never going to see you again
See, my life just doesn't seem right without ya
I can feel the tears comin' when I think about ya
Matter fact, I think I feel some now
I'm sick of holdin' them back, that's why I'm lettin' them out

[Chorus]
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now you're gone (And now you're gone)
And now you're gone (And now you're gone)
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you (And I miss you)
Oh, I miss you (Oh, I miss you)

[Verse 3]
I look in the mirror, I can see you in my face
I could care less now about your mistakes
Not 'cause they don't bother me, not 'cause they ain't bruise me
I just kinda feel like you ain't never knew me
I'm all mixed up, lost in the emotion
Loved you so much, too bad I never showed it
Yeah, but on the upside there's one thing
You put a smile on my face most times I sing, so
Mom, if you were here today, I would put my arms around you
And tell you I love you, yeah
I'd tell you I love you, I'd tell you I love you
Yeah, I would put your hand in mine, and tell you everything's okay
Oh, I miss you
Oh, I miss you, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye to you so soon
But now you're gone (And now you're gone)
And now you're gone (And now you're gone)
I never thought I'd have to say goodbye but now I do
And I miss you (And I miss you)
Oh, I miss you (Oh, I miss you)
