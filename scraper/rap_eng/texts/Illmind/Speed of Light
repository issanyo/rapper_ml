[Verse 1]
I have been far away
Losing myself in the night
I, I, I don't know which road to take
Can't tell what's wrong or what's right
I, I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to fly
I can feel the force waking up inside
Stronger than before, now it's do or die

[Chorus]
Living at the speed of light
I'm dancing with the dark side
With the dark side of my heart
Living at the speed of light
I just wanna shine bright
Like a bright sky full of stars

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I find myself
Feeding the shadows inside
Why-y-y? I don't want any help
I'm sinking deep in my mind
I, I, I

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to fly
I can feel the force waking up inside
Stronger than before, now it's do or die

[Chorus]
Living at the speed of light
I'm dancing with the dark side
With the dark side of my heart
Living at the speed of light
I just wanna shine bright
Like a bright sky full of stars

[Bridge]
Night after night I've been fighting it
The war that's inside of me
But if I open my eyes I'm defying it
I'm defying gravity

[Chorus]
Living at the speed of light
I'm dancing with the dark side
With the dark side of my heart
Living at the speed of light
I just wanna shine bright
Like a bright sky full of stars

[Outro]
With the dark side of my heart
With the dark side of my heart
With the dark side of my heart
