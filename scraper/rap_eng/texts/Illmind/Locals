You might catch us locals mobbing
At yo corner store
2 for 1 get them blunt wraps
Exhaling sour diesel smoke
You know We still
To get it
Oh so humble
Oh so vicious
Flower Power got me floating
Yeah it hit my system

[Verse 1:IshDARR]
Bring another ounce
(Ounce, Ounce)
IshDARR with the bounce
(Bounce, bounce)
Too many brauds
Had to kick a few out
I don’t need you to call
One text then I’m out
If we caught
Sorry clears my mind
The herb is OG only
Keep ya pine
Frosty as a goalie
Keep that dry shit
Doming blunts or doobies
All the time shit
We can get lost in a cloud
Muthafucking lost in a cloud
(Get so lost)
Niggas need to put that mid out
Please can put that mid out
(Put the mid out)
That matter is
The whip
Is where the action is
Squad like god damn
Can u pass it ish
Dome Malone
I laughed
Took one mo' hit
Mind is hazy
Curtiosy the diamond swish

You can catch us local niggas
Mobbing at the corner store
2 for 1 them blunt wraps
Exhaling sour diesel smoke
Staying humble staying vicious
Still no time for these hoes

[Verse 2: IshDARR]
I'm on 10
But I'm still piped down
I'm right here
With a bong
Clear it out
Gotta paper tucked
So nah never doubt
McBobs
I told them no sour Krout
It was
56 grams
In the pouch
It's one rule
No narcs in the house
Ozium just in case we spark
Squad was hotboxing dat garage
Poppa pulled up
.5 of that sour
Tester blunt
Just hit me up in a hour
With the punches
So when she don't function
I just call my other
Yeah the leaf emoji
Do I really even need the substance
Shit why else would i keep it on me
4 posted rolling  ever green
CCM STILL the only regime
