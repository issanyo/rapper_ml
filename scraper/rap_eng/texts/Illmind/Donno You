If you ain't from around here, better make it count
Or we gon' make you take it off
Like strip, I don't know you mothafucka
Strip, I don't know you mothafucka
If you ain't from around here, we don't never talk
We gon' leave you where you are
Like strip, I don't know you mothafucka
Strip, I don't know you mothafucka

[Verse One]
They said I'm guilty by association
All my homies is goons, they always on probation
When I was goin' to school (day ones)
Livin' incredible, doin' whatever to get to the revenue
Told me, "Emilio, stick to the records
And we be the ones with the criminal record"
Now hold up, hold up, I just seen them D's up in a black Impala
They pass in silence, when they gassed it
Then they flash the sirens, we young and lackin' guidance
So they out here actin' violent, brrrttt
And they better be gettin' response like it's a gentrapolic
The city that raised me crazy, they literally make or break me
Remember the times they let up the 9s they had to make for safety
They caught the homies in a vacant lot
And they was stuped like vaccinations
They ain't sick but they was takin' shots
We gon' make it out, we gon' make 'em proud
But there ain't no fathers, we all was raised by doubt
So who gon' save us now when they shoot and break us?
We don't trust no unfamiliar faces, I told ya

Strip, I don't know you mothafucka
If you ain't from around here, we don't never talk
We gon' leave you where you are
Like strip, I don't know you mothafucka
Strip, I don't know you mothafucka

[Bridge]
If me, ya would never been redgerin'
Ya can't come around without checkin' in
What ya doin round here?
Me wanna know what ya doin round here?
Ya run up into danger, stranger
Come round ya son without ya gun
Ya set up ya grave, ya feel ya a major problem
(Fuck ya doin' 'round here nigga
Come up off that right now)
Ya run up into danger, stranger
Come round ya son without ya gun
Ya set up ya grave, ya feel ya a major problem
I don't know ya mothafucka

[Verse Two]
And I live in the middle of uptown
Where the homies are lookin' for plugs now (and I never pitch)
And one of the people I'm fuckin' with bringin' the drugs down
In the middle of Baltimore to go get a pack
Takin' the bus down, as soon as they stop to park
We sittin' in back and pullin' the car round (in front of the pack)
Full of the xans, a couple of stacks
And they said when it done, it come back
And then they givin' the cash in thick rubber bands
He said it be comin' in fast, to build a demand and build up my clientele
Everybody be high as hell, all the homies in YSL (day ones)
Was walkin' down the stairs of my buildin'
I'm spendin' money I ain't makin', thinkin' I'm makin' a killin'
While he was posted by the fire hydrant on the homie Jag
He pulled me to the side and told me cats is askin' for they money back
Something about the work was bad, the product was weak
And that they heard some fake deals was makin' rounds in the streets
He said my price was so low, they probably thought it was me
Yeah, fuck it though, I got it for cheap
I went inside and called up my connect
I told him they were fuckin' up my checks
While I was gettin' texts on the block, sayin' they tried the shits
And ain't nobody buzzin' at all, not even slightly
Cats wanted to rob me, cats wanted to fight me
('Cause people act funny)
Fast money in distribution, don't wanna die or see inside an institution
The guilt is killin' me man, I don't gotta do this
But I gotta stop actin' stupid

[Hook]
If you ain't from around here, better make it count
Or we gon' make you take it off
Like strip, I don't know you mothafucka
Strip, I don't know you mothafucka
If you ain't from around here, we don't never talk
We gon' leave you where you are
Like strip, I don't know you mothafucka
Strip, I don't know you mothafucka
