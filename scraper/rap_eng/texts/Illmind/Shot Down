[Verse 1]
We've been here before, surrounded in the cold
You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you

[Chorus]
But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Verse 2]
I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku

[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?

[Bridge]
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down

[Chorus]
I've been shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
