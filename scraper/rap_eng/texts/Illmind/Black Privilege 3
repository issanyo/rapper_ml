Daddie Notch [intro]
Haaaa
Outta di dust
Our people shall rise
And victory shall not be denied

Napoleon Da Legend [verse 1]
Hope obliterated post race liberated
Familiar names in Obituaries in the papers
Corpses cremated strange fruit on trees hanging
Slaves segregate incarcerate 3 phases
Deshumanizing our nature in the legislature
Emancipation was joke just to test our patience
Kaleif browder is dead another martyr bred
Our time on earth is short like Eric Garner’s breath
Violence in our language is trivialized
The music business rewards the uncivilized
Misunderstanding the complexity of my complexion
In the mirror conflicted when seeing my reflection
Is it my Power you afraid of ?
My prowess with the cadence
I can just smile and exude greatness
The world best scientists couldn’t explain it
And everyday we make it thru despite is amazing

Daddie Notch [Chorus x2]
Straight through the struggle and trife we fight
Straight through the pain of life we rise
They wan' take our life
But  they can't break our pride

Napoleon Da Legend [verse 2]
Standing strong after the storm and the winds settle
The pains only boosting up my strength level
Pressing my luck cause being oppressed sucks
Police pressing us the situation messed up
Woman and man up we don’t get rest up
Gotta give the best of myself I gotta step up
Cause the stakes is raised up some wanna erase us
Racist and then again afraid to face us
So I praise everyday I day I wake up
Shaking the game up adrenaline is pumping my veins up
Making my way up we not from the same cut
We gave you a chance you turned around and betrayed us
Changed up the channel just to channel my anger
Still surviving despite being embattled and banged up
Blessed highly favored and prayed up never gave up
Shaped up on the path to be great what!!??

Daddie Notch [Chorus x2]
Straight through the struggle and trife we fight
Straight through the pain of life we rise
They wan' take our life
But  they can't break our pride
