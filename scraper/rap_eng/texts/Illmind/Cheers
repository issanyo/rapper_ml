I read the words of Carlin as I fall to sleep
I found my calling in the words, listen to the Sheik
See no need to floss or ball for shiny objects
You lost the main objective being selfish need to think
My heart extends to victims, innocent bystanders
Found a higher power, golden soul, Midas type of power
Love is a flower
Third eye towers over like Sears, empire is near
Smoke One Rap Vibe vision so clear
Grab a beer, find a chair, audio dope is here, cheers
I said grab a beer, audio dope is here, cheers

(Chorus)

Who seeks world domination
Racing for the traces, quit chasing chasers
Answer ain't found in that bottle
Started from the bottom, gripping 'Scato, to a line off a model
Vision Aristotle, golden soul drives the throttle
Lost the mission in the prison some debacle
My ambition, demand a listen
Lyrical ammunition, demolish any criticism
Fuck the opposition, Class the new addition
Get it started like ignition
Third eye guides, I ain't into wishing
Cost to live, born gifted
I found a fucking stick so I went fishing
Rap game keep me up yup I'm still itching
Couple tapes in I still ain't get my fixin'
Who we kidding, I scripted this vision
SORV listening to Gnarls Barkley
These barb wires hardly scar
I'm packing ammunition for a barb wire war
Can't see me in the stars
I said you can't see me, bitch I'm the stars
