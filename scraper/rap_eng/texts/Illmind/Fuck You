(Verse One)

Sun coming up and I ain't even pass out/
Cookin 24 my studios a trap house/
Only 22 im livin in a fast route/
Product of the people boy you know I gotta cash out!

But anyway I do this everyday like addiction/
No substances Ill fucken quit the second that I get it/
Have it back (i dont want that shit)
Start to battle rap, im bout i like a cataract/

Imagine that im all in.. i have no people that i call friends/
When i did honestly it got exhaustin..
Now i want a plaque.. no flossin
But look what im involved in i got no options/

Cop it drop it get the profit then repeat cycle/
Dont know what worse between my eating and my sleep cycle/
I do know that im doing me effectively so what do you expect from me this is what you get from me a fuck you!

(Verse Two)

Always been the type to run and say fuck that/
Got a nice clit positioned on my mustache/
I might hit it quick but i dont wanna rush/
Less we talkin bout rap noo i dont even bust fast/

Screamin fuck you prolly wonder where the loves at/
Once i get there imma unpack/
Start to settle in and i notice like oh shit?!/
This where all the drugs at/

On the way to heaven imma get into it one day/
No church.. poppin cherries on a sundae/
Do your research, weve had enough pain/
And all that bad energy is fucken up my feng shui/

So fuck you if your only gonna throw shade/
Fuck you when i drive i got road rage/
Fuck you and how the fuck you feel about it/
Fuck you fuck him fuck her and everybody..
