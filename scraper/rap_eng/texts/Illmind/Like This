[Verse 1]
I come of the tongue slick like Goldie
Start playing, the rap budget can't hold me
Quick to change lanes, got a couple of choices
Either way a nigga still eating muscles and oysters
Spilling Champagne on bitches, rockstar
Doing the Rick James on top of a cop car
I came uptown for a thousand grams raw
Back home had everything with the lockjaw
Now I'm in the BM and it's missing the roof
The Pittsburgh Nas without a chip in his tooth
Free Beanie Sigel, it's time to give him the truth
This one for the city, you know I did it for you
Like bang bang, nigga, shining like a DS
Turn it up a notch on these Plain Jane niggas
We ain't the same, nigga, you'se a lame nigga
I let my nuts hang like orangutang, nigga

[Hook]
We rocking on the mic like this
Like this the place that I belong
Everytime I rock a mic like this
I rock it all night long
Yo, don't I been whipping in the Benz like this
Like it's the whip that I belong
Everytime I drive a whip like this
I take a bad bitch home
She wanna, she wanna ride with a G

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I pull up, hop out and shine on 'em
Hating niggas wanna drop a dime on him
Bad bitches wanna naughty whine on him
But I'm grinding, shit, I ain't got time for 'em
Speeding down the parkway, hand on that woodgrain
Sitting on the park, can see the ice from far away
My nigga, I be working on my off day
Rap don't work I move up with my all yay
Big car? Check - bad bitch? Check
What we really do it for? Money, power, respect
Stones in the face, got me telling time on Breguets
Hand a label a bag, go take it out of my check
That hustling shit, you better believe it
Getting cold hearted cash, you can take it and leave it
Make a hater believe it
Little kids see the car and give chase when they sees it
It's a gangster achievement, nigga

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Real rap universal
Niggas get in the way with these half ass bars
Shit, man - we letting that shit slide?
Nah, it's murder

[Verse 3]
Yo, the microphone Godzilla
By the end of the song a lot of y'all out there gon' need pallbearers
Bong ripper sipping on hard liquor
Mad bitches trying to pull down my PR zipper
I shoot 'em with the venom in my denim
Two of my niggas, now she saying when ''I see 'em I'mma kill 'em''
Bottles of PJ, I chill 'em before I sip 'em
I hear a lot of niggas, but I don't really feel 'em
Before this rap shit it was everything foreign
Spots to vacate, I never seen touring
Living the fast life, ain't never got boring
Never stopped eating, got old cheddar mold
What you niggas holding? Play your cards right
You niggas start folding, I see these niggas posing
This grown man business, don't put your nose in
I'm from the jungle they grew the concrete rose in
Kick the player haters out and let the hoes in
