[Verse 1]
I jump in the pocket it's like if M A $ E up, 
In Purple Tape jewelry, '95 features, 
Aura never lie how we got it's how you see us, 
Caught in the design bet I'm flyer than a re up, 
Bottom line, we up, can't nobody see us, 
Invisible ghost writer how I light a screen up, 
I been up for hire like I got it by the liter, 
You ain't heard better since son was hollering "chea"
Cheer me on, look at the tier I be on, 
I done been acclaimed so long I'm cleared beyond, 
Music for my friends who never could steer me wrong, 
Straps all over their front like a pair of Deion's, 
For realla, and it get for realla like, 
Killing the top to figure out what the ceiling's like, 
From in the new shit, new shit, roof split like Goyards, 
Know I'm for the city like Olaf's 

[Chorus]
I been on my newfound crown holder, 
But it ain't nothing new now from how you know it, 
I been on my newfound crown holder, 
But it ain't nothing new now from how you know it
We don't even gotta back and forth it, 
I done made whoever come up off it, 
I been on my newfound crown holder, 
But it ain't nothing new now from how you know it

[Verse 2]
You can call this my new shit, but it ain't new tho, 
I done helped raise a couple stars that you know, 
Know the fans I be attracting is 'bout a loophole, 
Circling the check cash, tryna catch a new zoe, 
Talk keynote or kilo', I can do both, 
Crowned me for being the first to put 'em too close, 
Underrate him but over pay him is how the loop go, 
Still got the line on whoever is what you do know, 
And you know, jump in your lane and pull the echoes, 
Son I'm all over the aim, I'm hoodie Melo, 
Been up, to look like I wasn't wasn't an accident, 
So if I'm still sitting I'm Kaepernick, 
I tell ‘em like for realla, and it get for realla like, 
Killing the top to figure out what the ceiling's like, 
From in the new shit, new shit, roof split like Goyards, 
Know I'm for the city like Olaf's 

[Chorus]
I been on my newfound crown holder
But it ain't nothing new now from how you know it
I been on my newfound crown holder
But it ain't nothing new now from how you know it
We don't even gotta back and forth it
I done made whoever come up off it
I been on my newfound crown holder
But it ain't nothing new now from how you know it

[Bridge]
And I tell em realla, 
And it get for realla like, 
Killing the top to figure out what the ceiling's like, 
Killing the top to figure out what the ceiling's like, 
Aura never lie so you know what it’s hitting like
