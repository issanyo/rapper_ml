[Intro]
Ey man, if you got a problem with somebody
Whatever happened to approaching them?
Looking at em eye to eye
Too much tweefin' going on in this world
Thumb thuggin' is at an all-time high
They startin' to take this shit a lil too far Jack
Rappers all in they feelings
Well here goes a little lyrical healing

[Verse: Ludacris]
And hip hop is, uh
Too many rappers gettin' sensitive
Ya'll should start a pussy ass nigga initiative
Cuz even when I'm not mic'd up
I'll fuck your life up
Come to your show when ya crowdsurfin' and hold a knife up
I tell your momma you ain't shit
I hope you skydive and all land in an alligator pit
Your album ain't shit, you couldn't sell it at an auction
Your five minutes is up, like Antoine Dodson
Meanwhile that Mary Jane got me wiser
And Mr. Jack Daniels is my spiritual advisor
Now everybody said I'm strapped and I'm too scary
And keep a hand under the pillow like the tooth fairy
Your favorite rapper say I'm sick and they ain't no antidote
They kidnapping my flows they ain't even leave a ransom note
Your shit is faker than the knockoff man
I'll make you niggas quit rappin' start a hot dog stand
