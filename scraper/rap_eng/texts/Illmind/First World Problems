[Verse 1: SaeMonae]
We complaining about these cracks in these roads in these streets
When our future barely got enough food to eat
Now that’s food for thought
Materials come and go
But this life is all we got
But we focused on the trends
Who’s hot and who’s not
As my heart beats through my chest
My hands together praying on my knees as I rest
Praying that the lord come take me away
From this scary scary place
Everyday I get closer and closer to being insane
Yet they telling me that I’m the problem
That I ain't never gonna solve it
Cops picking fights like who we gonna brawl with
The citizens is who they don’t wanna go to war with
We put our hands up but it’s bullets that we fall with
So stop complaining  about your cracked screens
There’s babies out here losing their lives to crack dreams
While we weeping over someone else’s fruit of labor
We the one’s with the money shelter and the paper
What do you do when it’s too late to pray to your savior
I guess we’ll push it to the side and deal with it later

[Chorus: SaeMonae and A.S.H.E.S. The Chosen]
First World Problems (x2)
No Gas in the tank
We third world callin’
First world problems (x2)
No money in the bank
We third world ballin’

[Verse 2: A.S.H.E.S the CHOSEN]
Tell Jesus pick up his phone…
I’m in the studio
Gettin’ in my zone
(Hello?)
I been all over the world wit it (*echo - world wit it)
They stories made up
Cover Girl wit it (girl wit it)
Don’t let ‘em fool you
They absurd wit it
Brothas section on some take over the world shit
(Look, Nigga) I don’t like shit…
Yep, I’m on my Earl shit
Ain’t nothing odd in my future nigga
Cuz I earned it
Gettin drunk wit a gypsy as she kiss me on my cheeks
More afraid of polices then the leeches in these streets
Pastor walkin’ past us need to practice what he preach
Got the whole thang backwards
He react to what he see
Like the Slavemaster
White Jesus lookin’ at ya'
Lookin’ like the crooked coper
Send me to my grave faster
Mr. Holier-than-Thou
(Who)Tell me how I pray matter
Is the one defending’ cops as he watch our brain splatter
Like that…
Yeah...Like that
I took some time off
But a nigga right back
A million public opinions from all fuckin these minions
All I hear is granny wisdom tellin me to just rap
Like that

[Chorus: SaeMonae and A.S.H.E.S. The Chosen]
First World Problems (x2)
No Gas in the tank
We third world callin’
First world problems (x2)
No money in the bank
We third world ballin’
