[Verse 1: Sean Price]
Fifth split your wave cap
Bring beef where y'all niggas
Shit, shave and bathe at
Brave acts committed
Spray gats at midgets
Shorty shit stained felt the forty-fifth bang
Heat up your fam, you see the heat in my hand
My pistol, turn the punk into Peter The Pan
P, never step in my path, partner
I'm a vet sending threats to draft dodgers
The epitome of rap
Pity the fool that's rapping after me and that's fact
P's in town, weed green, leaf is brown
Seize the crown
Holdin' it, I'll beat you down
Listen Sean can spit nigga
Sean can split niggas
Chrome to your unknown
Nondescript niggas
I'll punch your head off your neck
Sean Pittsburgh
I spit words show me respect, P

[Hook]
Psycho killa!(x2)

[Verse 2: Boaz]
Yeah, okay
I'll jump out a nigga bushes in black attire
Empty out a magazine with rapid fire
I used to be the neighborhood crack supplier
Made so much paper need the music for a pacifier
What you niggas witnessing is evolution
I murder these tracks with no retribution
I'm sick of rappers with their internet pollution
Fabricating stories tell me who these labels been recruiting
Sucka niggas trying to wear camoflauge
Niggas only tough around the entourage
Your real life is nothing like your monologue
Niggas want a problem bring the drama to you mama yard
Squeeze the cannon without planning off instinct
My clip extension got me walking like my shit stink
This brand new automatic hair trigger
Got me itching to put a hole inside a square nigga
Yeah nigga!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Illa Ghee]
Graphic artist, I draw up on your face with a razor, lyric incubator
Black swastika, a freak of nature
Shoot a crowd of babies, I fucked a bitch with rabies
Flow don't water, arson of rap, I call it Navy, yeah
Rapid fire, spitting fire, fire in the hole
Nigga breathes the last dragon, dues, smack the booth
Life stress crack and coke
The first 2 was like an animal
The last two ones spitting like an antidote
Ante up, ended up in the g of the hand me ups
Hand me up the hammer
Pussy niggas pull ya' panties up
Family, I'll Grand Theft Auto the whole Grammys
A New York Knicks nigga
Guns bigger than Camby
Blood made of anti-freeze
Blast the track sneeze, bring the cognac
A couple rifle bullet where your home's at
Every order with a murder degree
My occupation is the murder to be
I'm Illa Ghee

[Hook](x4)

[Outro: Sean Price distorted voice]
Fist split your wave cap
Bring beef where y'all niggas
Shit, shave and bathe at
Brave acts committed
Spray gats at midgets
Shorty shit stained felt the forty-fifth bang
