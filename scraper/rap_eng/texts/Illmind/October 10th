[Intro]
Dream on, Dream on surely someone will understand me
What do I say when I know I've said too much?
I think that now I'm wastin' time, I am going, I am gone you are the absence in my mind

[Verse 1]
I remember when it was October 10th I heard the bad new I lost my best friend
My right hand man we was like fam, damn. He was with other kids I didn't know their names
They were going fast in the slow lane, he was in the car they went through the light....gone

[Hook]
If heaven wasn't far away I'd find a way to fly away so it could be the same, and its life
I don't got no time to wait so I'll try to change, live for today and I'll be okay and it's life
I don't care what anyone says cause you'll always be, you'll always be my friend
I'll never forget cause you'll always be, you'll always be my friend
Up until the end, you'll always be, you'll always be my friend
Oh my friend

[Verse 2]
Now I'm sitting here and everything is clear, even know your gone your still right here and I don't need to cry cause you told my why. And im maybe twelve for me to understand, all I need to now is we had a past that's the bottom line, just
Celebrate your life

[Hook]
If heaven wasn't far away I'd find a way to fly away so it could be the same, and its life
I don't got no time to wait so I'll try to change, live for today and I'll be okay and it's life
I don't care what anyone says cause you'll always be, you'll always be my friend
I'll never forget cause you'll always be, you'll always be my friend
Up until the end, you'll always be, you'll always be my friend
Oh my friend

[Outro]
I don't care what anyone says cause you'll always be, you'll always be my friend
I'll never forget cause you'll always be, you'll always be my friend
Up until the end, you'll always be, you'll always be my friend
Oh my friend
