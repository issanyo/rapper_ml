[Intro]
Check yourself
Check, check, check
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Chiddity-check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Ch-ch-check yourself before you wreck yourself
Yeah
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Before you wreck yourself, check, check, check

[Verse 1]
Hey, I'm back, so what's the deal now?
I still don't give a fuck 'bout how they feel now
I got you hot, lil' nigga, chill out
Say he coming for the spot? Bitch Itâ€™s a spill now
Leave a stain in the game, bruh
Fuck the niggas waiting on Young Tiller to change up
Niggas waiting on me to run out of paper
I don't ever speak on niggas, nah, I barely say much
Fuck, I look like, bringing niggas names up?
I can't let a fuck nigga get famous
These niggas, they wanna de-fame us
They wanna betray us, they wanna play games, oh no, no
Disloyal, this how they won't portray us
Looked at my dog like, "Fuck it, let's make 'em hate us"
If you got paid for the attention that you paid us
You would be a rich nigga but you just a bitch nigga
Foreign whip, make you throw a fit, nigga
Foreign bitch, I know you won't get with her
Lame niggas not the type that she consider
You thinking of speaking with her
Boy, you better reconsider
Hey, I'm my daughter's keeper
And I don't take with the threats or promises either, nigga
You gon' have to see me one way or another
And for my blood, bruh
I'm a cold motherfucker
(So!)

[Chorus]
Before you judge me
Check yourself before you judge me, hey
Shit could get ugly
Next time you might not be so lucky
What you want from me?
What these niggas want from me?
Listen "Don't fuck with me", hey
Think twice before you fuck with me

[Verse 2]
What it is though?
2016 Tiller on this shit, so
Most likely I'ma vent up on this shit, so
Well, um, damn, here it go
You see the shit is so new to me, bro
Not the music, that's easy, it come smooth to me, bro
When I should've been in school, I was making tunes, truancy, bro
Low-key, them cool kids weren't as cool as me, bro
I fell in love and had a mini me, thank you, Jesus
Ten fingers, ten toes on her pretty feet, seriously, thank you, Jesus
Pray for it every day in the UPS trailers
And you gave her to me like I asked, that's amazing, Jesus
I know the saying, give them an inch and they take a mile
But Jesus, I really need this, I gotta make it out
Studio shit on eBay, I gotta purchase
I told my niggas "Lend me 600 dollars, it'll be worth it, let's cop it"
(Check, check, check, check)
So many times I second guessed myself, nigga, I never wanted to be an artist, nah
(Check, check, check, check)
I don't wanna be the centre of attention but I guess I do this shit for lil' Harley, nah
(Check, check, check, check)
If you know me, you know I just want to be able to walk into Target and people not be astonished
Man, let me do my shopping
But this in my job, I asked for it, I got it, let's go
Just got a new manager, my last one was fucking up my vision
Can't believe this nigga still tryna get a percentage
I gave you back your investment, get out your feelings
Telling people that the money changed me
Nigga, the money saved me
Nigga, money is the reason that you fuck with me, ain't it?
And even though this shit got me angry, I'ma let God fix it
'Cause I know if I fix it, my daughter gon' have to grow up without a father figure
I'ma end up in prison
Wishing I never got into this business
It's nothing personal, I made a business decision
I might have a job for you if you shape or you could fill the position
That's as real as it gets
And sometimes I don't know how to deal with this shit
I've been searching for the answers in my idol's music
In his earlier days, man, I know he went through this
He got through this, I'll get through it

[Chorus]
Before you judge me
Check yourself before you judge me
Hey, shit could get ugly
Next time you might not be so lucky
What you want from me?
What these niggas want from me?
This is a, "Don't fuck with me"
Hey, think twice before you fuck with me

[Outro]
Check yourself
Check, check, check
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Chiddity-check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Check yourself before you wreck yourself
Yeah
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Before you wreck yourself, check, check, check
