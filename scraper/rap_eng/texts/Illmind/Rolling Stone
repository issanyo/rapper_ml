[Verse 1]
This suburban Pee-Wee Herman is presented as a rolling stone
Never been evicted, i'm not even from a broken home
I was in the slums of my mind, just pleadin' for a chance at these rhymes
They was just too busy sleeping like a lullaby (lullaby)
Justified reasons so I molded and I customized
Grievin' kept me breathin' through this era we inherited
Plagued by the arrogance, vergin' onto death with my beauty so American

[Bridge]
Back to square one, two times for that fake shit
Spotting out the spineless, stains for that bracelet
Back to square one, I watch my father grab his whiskey
If the fables tell the truth, I hope he comes to heaven with me, goddamn

[Hook]

[Bridge 2 x2]
I swear you lost your touch like you were fuckin' Colin Kaepernick
Always moving druggy, love the money, never passionate
Bout' to cop a pint and spend your paycheck on some Actavis
Welcome to the times, whole generation blasphemous

[Verse 2]
They always hated what they never had
Wishing for some love, it's like they asking for a better Dad
I see it in your father, society's depriving
Way's we living isn't proper, killin' by the dozen coppers
They always hated what they never had
Wishing for some love, it's like they asking for a better Dad
I see it in your mother, society's depriving
Way's we thinking and we wonder when the sorrows gonna end and when we gonna feel some comfort?
Say when we gonna feel some comfort?
Say when we gonna feel some comfort?
Goddamn, the way we thinking and we wonder

[Bridge]
