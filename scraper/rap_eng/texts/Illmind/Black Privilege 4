[BBass Chorus]
We shall overcome
We will pick up the pieces
We've always been so strong
We can build empires with our will
And I will climb so high
And the people will rise once again
It's in my DNA
It's my privilege yea

[Napoleon Da Legend verse 1]
I Gaze at the horizon see the sun rising
With an idea that sparked a barrel full of gun powder
Been bashed and laughed at bad mouthed and assed out
Crashing out on a stranger's couch passed out
I never tapped out got myself a laptop
Treat it like a trap house and make sure that the track hot
Always had to fend for myself investing in myself
I refuse to put the blame on anybody else
Was told I needed hits was told my numbers too low
Was told I was too lyrical and I needed some new clothes
Was told nobody knows you, you need some more publicity
Get some tats, dye ya hair, make your image more interesting
Follow fads, matter fact, take ya pride and swallow that
That’s where you wrong, I don’t show my ass for follow backs
Then it hit me like a ton of bricks up in my gut
They banking on the fact we thinking we not good enough

[BBass Chorus]
We shall overcome
We will pick up the pieces
We've always been so strong
We can build empires with our will
And I will climb so high
And the people will rise once again
It's in my DNA
It's my privilege yea

[Napoleon Da Legend verse 2]
We cried a desert of tears enough to fill up all the Great Lakes
And made us sing amazing grace so they can save face
Endangered like honey bees we the worlds melaninators
My soul stuck inside a Paisley Park elevator
This ain’t for the charts, travel to the uncharted
We bombarded tackling obstacles unguarded
Bout to finish what I done started
Mix some black magic with some mutant powers to become marvels
And from a spark all things are possible
No weapons that’s formed against us shall prosper
And no longer shall slander against our name stick
Left our baggage on that boat and we abandoned ship!
Game face like everyday’s a championship
And take flight without thinking of a landing strip
From a seed grows trees like Malcom by any means
Word to Combat Jack we gon' dreams those dreams

[BBass Chorus]
We shall overcome
We will pick up the pieces
We've always been so strong
We can build empires with our will
And I will climb so high
And the people will rise once again
It's in my DNA
It's my privilege yea

[BBass Bridge]
Know your place
Know your worth
It was written
With blood
In the dirt
That you are
A child of kings (yea)
Every time they tell you no
You have to take a swing (yea)
I am living proof
Descendant of slaves
They try to tell me no and make me behave
We can't help but lift our voice and sing
(lift every voice and sing)
We found our power
And the joy that it brings
