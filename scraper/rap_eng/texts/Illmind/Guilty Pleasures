[Hook]
This was never supposed to be
(Just like that)
But I started feeling you and you started feeling me
(Just like that)
And I don't know what it is you do, you got me trippin over you
We're not supposed to feel the way we do, but we do

[Verse 1]
You know your situation, I know mine
You all locked down, committed, the whole nine
But we still got down and did it the whole time
Raphael Saadiq and repeat the Slow Wine
Underneath the sheets slow grind and talk nasty to me
In the streets you wink and walk past me
Hand-in-hand with your man
I understand your plan but don't like it
It's alright I won't fight it, it's alright we both like it
The rush and the thrill
Of having secret meetings to sneak in the touch or a feel
I trust that you will
Eventually squeal and come clean and sing
And not to mention this "being in love" thing
That got you ready to leave me on the sideline thinking
What's the use of chasing if I can never replace him?
Even so I'm still planning to ride
Even though I'm just the man on the side

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I know my situation, you know yours
I'm all locked down, committed but so bored
Ol' girl made me wait to get it, was no whore
Got with her in '03 and hit it in '04
Now it feels like we been together for so long
It feels right to sit and weather the whole storm
But I still might slip, so whether the [?]
I've been doing it wrong for so long it's a trip
She may wig out and scream on my side chick
Cause a scene flip out like screens on a Sidekick
(Why this) happen at a time when there's so much on the line
Got me feeling like I'm going out my mind
(Borderline) schizophrenic I'm calling you baby she aborted mine
Hit the clinic now she calling me shady (I'm confused)
Am I cheating on her or cheating on you?
Guess I got my cake and eating it too

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
How do you define commitment?
Her opinion and mine is different, no time to nitpick
I got a girl that's a nine, fine, and gifted
Been looking for a dime to get with
The saying goes, "if it ain't broke don't fix it"
Go figure a nigga would risk it
I'm so restricted, and plus I feel so conflicted
Between what I know and what I hope to get with

[Outro]
I think it's time that we just
Make up our minds cuz we just
Can't be just, creepin around sneakin around
And I'm not the kind to be sleeping around
