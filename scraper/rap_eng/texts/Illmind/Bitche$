[Verse 1]
I ain't going for that
Better watch out nigga cause I'm too doper to copy cat
I rap to mean with it, that's just me with it
Even with a girl, I rap bout hoes fiending this dick
Now fall back, cause that's uber real
I am just a young nigga loud that's too true to chill
Can't fuck with it, it's best you just honor
And if you don't I might haunt ya like monsters
My old fashion is the future to these new niggas
All my lyrics tight their's loose nigga
All my fist be like lets lose niggas
I'm too nigga to even notice him but hey I'm a nerd
Still pulling the baddest swarming to play in my herd
Like I'm a pimp but give 'em cake like a third
I can't help it, cause this is how I'm living
But baby boy a king, be on the watch for Diff.Rnt
