[Intro]
Yeah
Huh
What
Yeah

[Chorus]
You can call me crazy yea a screws loose
Raise the murder rate when I let the goons loose
You fucking with a nigga who ain't got it all
You fucking with a nigga who ain't got it all
32 shots I got the Mac on me get clapped I send your ass to your dead homies
I ain't got it all, I ain't got it all

[Verse]
I told that a screws missing that Mac get to spraying like a
Fu-Schicken
Use to sell soap now I get it off the boat
Stean had it 19.5 the King of cooking coke
Square Biz Stunna on my Queens shit I don't need good aim it got a beam bitch
Still riding through the ghetto with the hard white rock I ain't talking heavy metal
They on because I gave the word that nigga green like he play with Bird
Cheese on his head like a Packer, prepare for the life after


[Chorus]
You can call me crazy yea a screws loose
Raise the murder rate when I let the goons loose
You fucking with a nigga who ain't got it all
You fucking with a nigga who ain't got it all
32 shots I got the Mac on me get clapped I send your ass to your dead homies
I ain't got it all, I ain't got it all


[Verse 2]
Gem star in that black tape I get to cutting like a DJ
Still on that can peanut butter in the oatmeal
Nigga I blam quick
0-9-R-32-32 jump bad I turn your head to a convertible
Pockets still on creatine, bank account steroids I been getting cream [Hannnn]

[Chorus]
You can call me crazy yea a screws loose
Raise the murder rate when I let the goons loose
You fucking with a nigga who ain't got it all
You fucking with a nigga who ain't got it all
32 shots I got the Mac on me get clapped I send your ass to your dead homies
I ain't got it all, I ain't got it all
