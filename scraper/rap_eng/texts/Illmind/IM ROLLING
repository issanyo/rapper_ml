[VERSE 1: GREEKDAGOD]

Rappers I eat those
Bad shawty I need those
Catch me in my co5
I make your halo rise
Make you kiss the sky
Cloud that's in your eyes
You pray for da day
You won't cross my sites
Looking for a legend
Here I arrive
Won't catch me outta space
Just surfing da sky
Where I float on clouds
That look like pies
O I'm getting you hungry ?
Foreign girls like Yeah
Back when I started in da class room
Just a few rhyme
Made it out da classroom
Just a few took it beyond da class room
I sign a contact to my promise
Just To murk this fool

Back in 08
I announce my promise ima get cake
Man how time pass
When You riding around
And you getting cash

[Hook:GREEKDAGOD]
I'm rolling (8x)

[VERSE 2: GREEKDAGOD]
Yeah they call greek
Yeah they call greek
3 or 4 chains
Just to feel complete
My new jeep
Only if I did cop dat new jeep
Feeling super fresh
In my new sneaks
Better buy a fan
Cause I bring da heat
Lost niggas , who though they could figure my flow is way bigger then they mind could even figure

Behold the legend in your eyes
Don't blind the flames is burning up in da sky
And don't think I won't come up right up in your side and rip the 45 and a-ks blasting on ur side

[Hook:GREEKDAGOD]

You know what I'm talking bout
I'm riding around
I'm riding around and getting it
I'm riding around (2x)
So catch me

I'm rolling (6x)
So catch up
I'm rolling (6x)
So catch up

They call me greek
