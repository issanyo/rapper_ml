[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, huh I'm back again muh'fuckers
Rapper, Rapper Big Pooh, yeah, uh, yo

I welcome all to the evolution, better yet
This is the revolution, and it will be televised
The round table where we strategize
I got a plan in my hand, said I plan to land a perfect prize
Lay my hand between the perfect thighs
H.O.J. what it is, you don't really want it with us guys
Check my stock cause the Dow say I'm on the rise
I'm more determined than before, you can check the eyes
Got 'em hating on me +Shawty+, you ain't heard of +Plies+?
Me and my niggas got a bond, this is family ties
This is more than a recording, this is life reporting
I'm through courting with you niggas, time to Ken Norton
Knock 'em out, I really tried to block 'em out
Tighten your belt, get prepared cause ahead's a drought
Real niggas round the world gotta hear me out
I'm tryna tell you something good, that's what I'm talking bout

[Hook X2]
Hold up, you know I'm still in the groove
Thought I'd remind y'all, I cannot be moved
A chip when I rhyme cause I still gotta prove
To most muh'fuckers that I will not lose

[Rapper Big Pooh]
They wanna know how I feel about my current state
I tell 'em "Never been better yo, I'm feeling great"
I took a step off the wagon, had a piece of steak
Now niggas hopping off the wagon, good, it's less weight
I can't wait for the day my album does hit shelves
Niggas back in the lab, remixing themselves
I'm hell on peers, and conquered all fears
Never got gassed when I first heard 'em cheer
Never got mashed so I'm still standing here
A vision more clear, Goodie Mob in my ear
Dope as I appear, they still got questions
Mind on my money, all that bullshit is second
Top of the pecking order and I reckon
For you to take a second, look what I've become
A star in my own right, Rapper Pooh take flight
Niggas still hating like I only just begun

[Hook X2]

[Rapper Big Pooh]
Yeah, haha, I can't lose man
Rapper, H.O.J
You know what it is nigga, uh
