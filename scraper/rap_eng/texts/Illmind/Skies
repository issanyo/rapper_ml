[Verse1: KING Z3US]

Time and time again/ i gotta show them/ i been hella focused/ think about my life and where im going/ babe no hocus pocus/ i just want my mama in that foreign/ in her driveway/
No more nights on that couch boy i done came a long way/ hustlin n hustling man i done blew my re up/
Fuck it im back in the trap so ima put my feet up/
Fire in my eyes i can't lie soon you gon need us/
We just gon do this forever balling u gon see us/
Gold on my neck gold on my wrist look how the wrist work/
I need the bands i gotta pull up n show out/ skurttt/
Gold on my neck gold on my wrist look how the wrist work/
I need the bands i gotta pull up n show out/ skurttt/
