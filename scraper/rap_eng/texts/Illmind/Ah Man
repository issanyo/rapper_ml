[Verse: Fabolous]
Yo, dog been gettin' money, DMX like
Been in these streets since BMX bikes
I just do it, in a pair of 3M check Nikes
Why not? That's who I'm tryna see them checks like
I'm who you dream of bein' fresh like
Put holes through your fly shit, leave 'em distressed like
We'll be rich forever, we invest right
You know he's doin' more if you see him less, right?
Still remember BMF nights
Remember that night? Your BM left, right
Oh my mama she was in my DM left, right
Thick ass thighs, I was in between them next night
Ah man, you see him stressed right?
You didn't think I would be impressed right?
Bitch ass niggas get PMS right?
Now you bleedin', screamin' for the EMS like
Ah man, ah man
Ah man, ah man
Ah man, ah man
Ah man, ah man
