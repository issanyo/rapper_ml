[Sample]
"You better quit while you're ahead"

[Verse One]
Motherfucker you ain't a tough guy
Your songs lie
You fucking herb I got a cosign from Illmind
Ask the block if they know Bam'
Every phrase will start with "Oooh man" and end with "goddamn"
"That brother nice wit it."
Even the critics dig it
I only say important shit like a prison visit
I see your internet videos and I shake my head
"You better quit while you're ahead"
While the block keep my albums bought
Cause I tackle issues that ain't talked about with your moms and pop
Homie
It's a fragile life
A revolutionary man of color like Jesus Christ
Over your head ain't it?
Like a Basquiat painting
I guess that's why the class dummies in the back hate it
And gravitated to that low brow rap instead
"You better quit while you're ahead"

[Hook]
Don't believe what the numbers on your Myspace say
Half of those is fake profiles anyway
You ain't scaring nobody with that tough guy face
You are better off dead than living that way
You are taking up space (yes)
Quit right away (please)
Or jump off a bridge and try landing on your face
You suck motherfucker, how much better can I say it?
"You better quit while you're ahead"

[Verse Two]
Ayo this is dedicated to the sucker in his bedroom
Who studies street life off the clips off Youtube
Pirate Pro Tools
Get a compressor mic
Then make a record 'bout a life he ain't living like
And my beef is
Just on some street shit
You exploiting all my murdered friends who been through it
Who would rather be alive than dead
"You better quit while you're ahead"
All good cousin
I guess the fake is funner
Photo shopping bullet holes on your album cover
While bullet holes riddle little babies out in Haiti
I'm sure that they'd appreciate the murder that you faking
Never tell the consequence, post gun smoke
The life sentences
Children at funerals
Gangsta, you ain't even a dirty Sanchez (hahaha)
"You better quit while you're ahead"

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
What's up to Dirty Jerz
Hasan Salaam and 'em
Illmind produced a banger that make your neck bend
Look at your best friend
Like, "Are you hearing this?"
Keep the sample on homie, I ain't clearing shit
Anyway, back to the topic of discussion
But then again I made my point so enough with 'em
But just in case you missed the point once again
"You better quit while you're ahead"
If you thinking 'bout dabbling in some crack smoking
If you trying to keep going after the condom broken
If you desperate for money and think of robbing me
If you a concert promoter who think of jerking me
If you thinking of driving after a night of liquor
If she got a boyfriend and you trying to kick it wit her
If you thinking, "It's just a little info to the Feds..."
"You better quit while you're ahead"
"Or you're better off dead"
"Better off dead"
"Better off dead"
"You better quit while you're ahead"

[Verse Four: Geologic]
Me and Bam' been fighting a cold struggle
Fight, sleep so much our eyelids have grown muscles
Seven stacks of islands that's in trouble
Now we gotta bring it back for our sons so they can see the sun
And not have to run all day
If they ever made a group they can be A.K
I'm trying to see them play
Watching Yo Gabba Gabba's Biz Mark's beat of the day
Mad rappers wanna see us decay
But we're still running laps around them other cats
And now I'm coming back like Douglas McArthur without the coward act
He never stuck around to see Hukbalahap fight back
From the bottom to the top like that
Make noise like your uncle at a cock fight back
In the Barrio again
Make sure that you get exact change if you spend
