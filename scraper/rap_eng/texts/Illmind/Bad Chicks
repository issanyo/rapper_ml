Told y'all I'm tired of playin with y'all

[Hook]
All the bad chicks in the building
Let me see you put your hands to the ceiling
A young G about to cut, God willing
Got her screaming I love this feeling
All the bad chicks in the building
Let me see you put your hands to the ceiling
A young G about to cut, God willing
Got her screaming I love this feeling

[Vamp]
All my wild women get get it on the floor
Get get it on the floor - get get it on the floor
All my, all my wild women get get it on the floor
Get it on the floor - get get it on the floor

[Verse 1]
40 thousand dollars on a gold watch
Still ain't gon' help me tell the time better
Still ain't gon' help nobody rhyme better
I still spend on it so I shine better
Hatin from the side - that's a clown's life
Spending money on these women that's what clowns like
!llmind on the track - you know it sound right
Put my record on and that's what money sound like
Tick tock - click clack
Tell iTunes I need my shit back
New G-Wagen on that pitch black
Show sold out I need that bitch packed

[Hook]

[Vamp]

[Verse 2]
Shorty starin' cause she know that I'll damage her
At least a milli every year with no manager
No label - straight off the iPhone
While you lames is switchin' lanes I'm switching time zones
Ferrari California on Luanda streets
Still ain't gon' help me get to Hell faster
Still want a home out in Redondo Beach
Church of the G's homie I'm the Pastor
Hundred thousand dollars in that offering plate
That's enough to make a nun wanna fornicate
Make her get up out that robe - take her on a date
Told her all we got is now I don't wanna wait

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And baby all we got is right now
All we got is right now
No use in being shy now
Find out right now
All we got is right now
All we got is all our love and
All we got is right now
All we got is right now
And I want you to carry my love child
Baby won't you carry my love child
I want you to carry my love child
Cuz you're the one I care about
Let's just make a love child
I want you to carry my love child
Baby won't you carry my love child
I want you to carry my love
(She aim to please - you don't need to ask her)
I want you to carry my love child
I want you to carry my love child
Baby won't you to carry my love child
Carry my love
I want you to carry my love child
Baby won't you to carry my love child
I want you to carry my love child
Right now

[Outro]
No use counting the days
We've got now there's no need to waste it
Wasting time
Quit wasting time
Quit wasting time
