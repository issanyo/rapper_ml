[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
The fucking thought of you’s repulsive
Don’t you think you got the right to right consultant
Gave your letters to the kids but I don’t know if they been opened
You cheated on me with Lisa but now we close friends
She said you got her pregnant twice and ran away from those kids
We fucking bonded over hating you
The more time that passed, it’s like the less I got to say to you
You fucking piece of shit, had attorneys and social workers all chasing you
They said you left the country and then made that Venezuela move
I paid your way through school, your degree because of me
Now I’m working triple shifts to pay the bills you stuck to me
Been trying to keep the kids in school and make sure there’s enough to eat
We gave our son your name so when I talk with him, it fuck with me
Now that’s the families you left and should’ve never had
Should’ve been a fucking sperm donor and never been a dad
You're writing letters when you should be writing checks to me
And having kids with bitches, man, you shook, it all suspect to me

[Hook]
Ain’t no sympathy for the devil, (Diablo) nah
Ain’t no sympathy for the devil, (Diablo) nah
Now I ain’t feeling bad for ya, I give a damn ‘bout ya
There was a time when I gave everything I had to ya
Ain’t no sympathy for the devil, (Diablo) nah
Ain’t no sympathy for the devil, (Diablo) nah
Now I ain’t feeling bad for ya, I give a damn ‘bout ya
There was a time when I gave everything I had for ya

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
Emilio surprised that I forgot you hitting mom
Forgot about you stalking her and all the times the pigs were called
It affected me I guess ‘cause I can’t get along with men at all
And senior year, I even took a chick to prom
Refuse to date men, a lesbian, I hate men
I’m looking at ‘em like they all liars, cheaters and rapists
And the last thing I remember when you used to call me Chacas
And you flew us to Caracas to meet you on that vacation
And we stayed at our Abuela’s apartment while you just visited
And hid the other family you living with, all the kids and shit
You said I had a sister that reminded you of me
But you left twelve years ago and said that she was two or three
Me and E from mom, Jake and Madison from Lis
And I’m guessing all the time between, you added two or three
Right? So I had to cop an attitude and leave
I thought I’m daddy’s little girl, yeah, sad little truth for me

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Emilio Rojas]
Don’t never say I'm like you, man, I don’t even like you
I barely even know you, wouldn’t know where I could write you
I thought that I would fight you when we met again
Instead I’m sitting, looking at yo ass like we ain’t never met
Acquaintances, we never friends (Who the hell are you?)
I’m spending every second trying to be a different man
But we share a lot of similarities, the shit is bad
And I’m a little mad you wrote me all them notes to me
And all the shit you told me at the end, nobody knows but me
Now you a lonely man, it’s only right
But suicide’s a coward’s way out of a problem, you took your fucking life
But they don’t know you like I know you, they think you’re alive
I know it’d make my sister cry, it’d probably make my mother smile
Mama after closure and Sis want you to hold her
But me, I’m happy acting like I barely fucking know ya
And everybody told me I’d forgive ya when I grow up
It’s too late for that, I saw your casket close, it’s over
