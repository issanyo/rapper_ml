[Verse 1]

I'm so fucking ill you'd think I was from Park Hill
The land of the warriors, notorious and victorius
My city dirty but worthy, they'll sell you for 30 pieces
Like Jessus, leave you in pieces, tell me where your peace is?
I grew up told I was wrong
That I don't belong
But I belong on a throne
Don't worry it won't be long
Benevolent and righteous but they call me irrelevant
Im the fire element and my style is evident
I should be elected for president
I should be crowned as a king
But I'll leave you faceless like the movie 'The Ring'
I'm a breath of fresh air you would think it was spring
Everywhere I walk by 'chaching-chaching'
Supreme supreme
Forever young is my theme
Fo real, fo real?
I chill, I chill
But the problems aren't standing still
Still I got some skill
And curiosity the ferocity of my nature makes me wanna kill
Fresh Poet Society, the world's variety
I'm screaming defiantly
The gods are standing quietly
Waiting on a miracle to be recognized as lyrical
Put you in hypnosis with some wisdom so satirical
Crack a book open don't book a crack moment
It seems I'm on the brink and god is my opponent
We live in a society built by poor snobs
Where even the most qulified can't find a good job

[Hook 2x]

Believe in your dream
It's not always what it seem
Don't let the gleam fade
Cuz you might as well be dead
Fast life lights are moving fast
The future is the past
And the present just a test
What matters is in your chest

[Verse 2]

Degrading, fading, made to fail
Still I play this game for real
Brain frozen, maybe it's an omen
Roaming on these streets
On the corner with the creeps
Swallowing another cup
Hearing 'homie the fuck is up?'
Slaping hands stained by mud
Get a hit from a fucked up bud
I feel my eye they become like blood
I see my lies and how they flood
I see your lies and how they cut
I'm trying to tell you something vital before I go insane
My anger keeps on feeding on smoking, drinking and major pain
I could stop at anytime, but my mind most likely not contain
I keep my focus so ferocious on the all things that I can't obtain
But it seems I can't complain, because Im no pussy, I'm a man
Sometimes that shit is more important than your brand new golden chain
I constrain myself from the luxury of strippers and cocaine
But I feel the day is coming when I'll hardly hesitate
Overdose inflicted on me by depression and a loss of faith
If you are trying to find some answers then you probably can relate
Im dead

[Hook 2x]
