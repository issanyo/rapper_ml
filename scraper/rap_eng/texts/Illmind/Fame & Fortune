Verse 1 (Dae):Im not tryna be a rapper
I'm tryna be great ,and legend is my middle name ,you want beef i got steak
I was high like the stakes
To your heart with the steak
So don't try to mistake me for any but great
If life is a race you need speed to dip
But your life's a act better read the script
Aye b brought the clips you ain't seeing this, you're the captain get capped then
Now lead the ship , they say Dae why you want the fame , you're the Irish just fighing like Notre dame , ima dig up my past til they know the pain, ima keep yellin dae till they know the name , i ain't passing the sticks they don't know the game , i can't show them no love i ain't tory lanes
Need a fortune at or before the fame
And every line is fire can't ignore the flame
I came in this game as a orphan
For fame and the fortune
The pain and the torture
The hate and the worship
I can't maintain i'm just torching
Burn all the skin off their corpses
Working till my pockets big as norbit
Tryna take off be in orbit
Forcing the fortress to break
Watch me when i orchestrate
My styles the source of your hate so they force me away

Hook(manny) : I'm here for the fame and the fortune
I'm here for the fame and the fortune
Miss me with anything else i ain't come here to talk i just came for the fortune , i'm fly like i play for new orealeans
Just wait for the day that i'm touring
Watch out for the smoke cuz i'm torching
I'm better than any before me

I'm here for the fame and the fortune
I'm here for the fame and the fortune
Miss me with anything else i ain't come here to talk i just came for the fortune , i'm fly like i play for new orealeans
Just wait for the day that i'm touring
Watch out for the smoke cuz i'm torching
I'm better than any before me

Verse 2(illmind) : how you fit bars in a rap like tht
How you rap like that?
Why you snap like that? Bro you really gotta chill don't spazz like that
Grinding to the top no cash like that
But if I invest time I need my cash right back
I'm a ga)wd in a world filled with peasants
Murdering the game it ain't pleasant
Got hands in the air like they saying that they present
They typical killable stacking these syllables flipping reciprocals following principles
Schooling these kids yall talking to literal
Forbidden
Fruits so let me get at em(Adam)
Our skills are not even(Eve) dawg I just been had em
They couldn't imagine the little known dragon to grow up be rapping
I hopped on the track and I'm snapping
Why is you acting you swear you be trapping
Yo gun is not active
Actions speak louder than word You wouldn't be nun without it
I feel like I'm a doubted my mind is so crowdedÂ 
I stay pulling Jack's so my bean stalk has sprouted
Step in the booth and I'm feeling so comfortable
Stacking up bills so I can live huxtable
Alphabet soup and snacking a lunchables
Bodies the track now i'm feeling uncomfortable

Hook(Manny):i'm here for the fame and the fortune
I'm here for the fame and the fortune
Miss me with anything else i ain't come here to talk i just came for the fortune , i'm fly like i play for new orealeans
Just wait for the day that i'm touring
Watch out for the smoke cuz i'm torching
I'm better than any before me

I'm here for the fame and the fortune
I'm here for the fame and the fortune
Miss me with anything else i ain't come here to talk i just came for the fortune , i'm fly like i play for new orealeans
Just wait for the day that i'm touring
Watch out for the smoke cuz i'm torching
I'm better than any before me

Verse 3(dae):All rap aside , im from a place where black is pride, you tlk that blood stuff you actually died , and i have survived , im in a place where you're classified , as a thug just for packin nines , you dont act in time , you get popped when you grab your nine , that's why the jail rate can't decline , cuz we all fall down it's domino affect that's what happens when you stand in line , but i ain't havin that , need money fallin like a avalanche , so i can feed my fam instead of makin only half a ant , rn im only makin half a cent , if ion do it no one will that's the reason why i can't depend , i won't ever let you have a win , and if words can kill then ik i already have a clip , so better watch at who you lashin at , im not a pacifist im always ready to go grab the clip, i been workin now i'm numb from the pain , donald trump the way i run a campaign, i feel above you like i jumped from a plane , raps the blood that's pumping under my veins , call me dae i want you humming the name ,yes it's dae i brought the sun to your pain , so how does any person plan stop the shine , when that's the only thing that comes with my name, fortune and fame
