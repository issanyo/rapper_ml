[Verse 1: GreekdaGod]
It's feel like
It was all a dream
Bitch niggas scream
Killer kings the theme
Smackafella the theme
But who knew
Real niggas obsolete
Grown man need help
Crossing the street
For the love of money
They start the beef
The way I'm killing
These beats, it's murder You see
Golden gun flow
Y'all all decease
Me against the world
We all could meet

Tell me who hotter then I
Super hero flow
I don't need to fly
You wouldn't punch concrete
That's I , You won't stare into a lions eye
If you live under my roof
I'm the house on fire
You wouldn't survive
You couldn't stand the heat
Don't u lie
Cause I'm Always on the rise
Like smoke in sky

[Hook: Martin Luther King speech]

[Verse 2: GreekDaGod]
Dreams that wash away that's a deficit
Working together
That's a lost method
Since the 1960
We didn't learn shit
We all in denial
But we all know the true
We treat are black skin like dirty gooey
Black women don't wanna keep
There natural roots
For the cash and green we all deceive
Family & Friends
We don't give respect until they r.i.p

[Outro: Martin Luther King speech]
