[Verse One]
Look at me now, the new cat from Carolina
That came to the game for dolo with no co-signers
Or big names behind him or established producers
I came with a flow and a passion for music
No animated flows no make believe tales
Skippin' over retail
For them overseas sales
I don't flow for females
I just speak my mind
To real women who appreciate beats and rhymes
Each time I pick up a pen, you must admit it
I make beats sound taylor made and custom fitted
And plus I spit it
For more than a loop and a drum break
A plague to the industry, the future is unsafe
Now let's be rational
I'm international
You got an attitude
Where niggas cut your groupies in one place
And you seein' Sup on the front page is painful
I feel the animosity but that ain't gonna change dude

[Verse Two]
Now my flow is throwback and my style is straight forward
I feel people deserve the truth if they pay for it
And I ain't with a gimmick or image I'm authentic
Never suffer from unlimited penmanship every sentence is original
Unique in it's own way
I built a reputation spittin' wordplay that other niggas won't say
Regardless if it don't pay more than minimum wage
I can still respect myself at the end of the day
Unlike so many in this industry who made it to gold
They got a plaque on the wall but no creative control
But with my music, I'm breakin' ground, pavin' the road
Like jazz legends gettin' praise when I'm 80 years old
And I'm part of the new generation, renaissance movement
Stop tryin' to label it
It ain't conscious music
So pardon me if you think I'm too deep and serious
I just write what I feel and speak from experience

[Verse Three]
I got a catalog collection of music I made
And I got battle scars that'll prove dues that I paid
And Sup can deal with any obstacle that you throw at him
After all the road blocks of rockin' with Soul Spazm
Object, and it won't matter
The checks, have grown fatter
Respect, I don't battle
I guess, I've grown of 'em
Yep, back in the day I never thought I was gon' change
Now I got an album out and I'm thinkin' long range
Refuse to drop a single, do my thing and fall off
The Lost Colony, that be my team of all stars
And if you don't think that we all raw, I'm warnin' ya
After the show you can get hauled off by the coroner
Back for the encore with raps that's hardcore
You cats is all soft, go back to the drawing board
Advanced and far more, believe it people, I'm real
I got a style that's more deadly than fallin' asleep at the wheel
Let's go y'all
