[Intro: Peter Labeaud]

You ignored me be fore
I bet it don't happen no mo
Who's your friends and who's enemies, no
Who's against you and who's with  you till the end

[ Bridge: Danny B & Peter Labeaud]

Have ya felt down on your luck
Well, it’s time to pick ya self back up
Them battles scars and wounds will heal
Knowing the difference in
Whats fakes and what’s real
(Who’s against me)
Now, Who’s against me?
(Who’s against me)
Now, Who’s against me?
(Who’s against me)
Fuck who’s against me
(Who’s against me)
Now, Who’s against me?

[ Verse 1: Peter Labeaud]

What I gotta do to show theses kids
That they can do better?
Pave the way so they can drive away
From eskimo feelings
But you don't know what they feeling
Mentally 24/7
How can i make your life better?
It’s a hell of a blessing
To grip this mic’
I've been contemplating
Freeing all these free nations
But if they already free
Then why you gotta free em again?
Aha, good question
Hope i sparked something
The powers in me
The powers in you
The power’s in all of us
You just gotta know how to use it
Most of us hold it and don't use it
But whats gonna change
From silencing myself in the dark
Either you can fade away with regrets like sand grains in the desert
And keep your dreams and aspirations to yourself because you were afraid of rejection
Or stand up for what the fuck you believe in
And be willing to die for that shit
No neglection or second guessing
Once you thought it then confirmed it
Chase it don't waste it

[Hook: Peter Labeaud]

Never Afraid
To let my dreams go to rest
I ain't never afraid
To get rejected again
I ain't ever afraid to let you take my life
I ain't never afraid
So I ain't ever Gon stop
And I ain't ever Gon stop
And I ain't ever Gon stop
And I ain't ever Gon stop
Im gon’ fight ‘till I die
And I’m fight ‘till you kill me
In the street until we get the
People free
But you’d rather kill me before
You let me be free

Ah!!!

[Hook 2]

I’m ‘bouta take it way, ay, ay, ay, ay back
I’m ‘bouta take it way, ay, ay back
I’m ‘bouta take it way, ay, ay back

[Verse 2: Peter Labeaud]

‘Bouta take way back
Back to when they my fucking
Culture and my heritage
What I inherited
Hate and cold stares on your faces
Like you never saw a (nigga, nigga, nigga)
Oh wait, you’d rather call me (slave, slave)
We all slaves, white slaves, black slaves
We enslaved, we in chains
No kun-te
You been changed
I don’t know how much more
Oppression that I can take (hey)
What you gotta’ tell me (say)
Fuck you think of me (hey)
