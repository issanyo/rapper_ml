Wassup
And it don’t stop, and it don’t quit
The ultimate, uh, yea
Till the break of dawn
Early morn' we go on and on, uh
And it don’t quit, and it don’t stop
To the body rock, uh
We go on and on
Till the early morn, break of dawn, uh, uh

(Let It Ride, Uh)

[Verse 1]
My head’s shook with ache, trying to shake the stress barriers
Striving to carry a substance to maintain this character
Ransom no different, standing specifically indented presence of the wickedness I'm clamming
And God's my witness that I overcome the sum of the
Conviction possibilities around approximately inner me
Whole identity could be my enemy,misery trapped inside assembly planning to better me, coercing taking virginity

Definitely I'm not innocent problems are infinite and to fall is rather the simplest way to opposite enter
Digging deep into my cellar and I look to see whether it's my tormentor/killer
But I touch that this corrupt subject is what's next
No means to an end, unlike a year 2000 musket
Pointed at a thug's neck or opposite justice
With scores of gorillas and militias the judgement is coming


[Hook]
Pick it up piece by piece (Yea, yea)
Pick it up piece by piece (Yea, yea)
Pick it up piece by piece

[Verse 2]
I just wasted an hour of my life watching videos
Stilletos and silly hoes, sex scenes and mini-blows
Cheap shots on God, everybody's a rockstar
I'm glad we got endorsements, but some of them are not art
It makes me wonder what I'm trying to get into
Beyond fighting these social issues, subliminals now literal
Hidden is now visible, symbols are so visual
Even if minuscule altercations become critical

I thought a metaphor would get a crowd
Forget applause, and let it marinate
So I season their intellectual appetites instead of raps that's half as nice, snaps that's mad precise
And feed 'em a bitter treasure all at once
Dunce, stupid I should have guessed that all
These bad investors want is to sell short
I'm purchased from hell long going for an increase of profit
Securities in God over the devil's bond, stock it

[Hook]
Pick it up piece by piece (Yea, yea)
Pick it up piece by piece (Yea, yea)
Pick it up piece by piece (uh, huh)

[Verse 3]
I'm too simplistic to be statistic, twisted
Predictable, be specific
Viscous, miscellaneous, missile misfit
Gorillas in the mist it's a risk if you missed it
Tiskit, load a bullet biscuit
Pull it within inches, sniper
The eyes part, split vision, refrigeration of a Christian
Dead to the sin sick sadistic in the land of the quick and

Count it all loss from a titular rip
With particular precision, this vision stick figures
You can't hang a man dead when he's deceased
Released from his last breath, six, feet deep and get the big picture
This hipster hangs head, hunger pangs spread
Brain dead, aneurysm
Mystifying the lion without lying
There's a silver lining in laying' your life down, try it, lighters
