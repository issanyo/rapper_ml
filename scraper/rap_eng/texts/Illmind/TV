[Intro: 1K Phew]
Aye, y'all see them folks over there
Them folks watching too hard, boy
Leggo live

[Hook: 1K Phew]
They must not believe me
I just took it easy
(Huh?) Just turn on the TV
(Huh?) Don't watch me, just watch the TV

[Chorus: 1K Phew]
Live television, goin' live television
Live television, goin' live television
(Huh?) Goin' live like the TV
(Huh?) Don't watch me, just watch the TV

[Verse 1: 1K Phew]
Had to flex a muscle up
We should keep the struggle out
Thick and thin we had to tussle out
Got a lot to hustle 'bout
We gon' make some noise, they know we them boys, yeah
Grabbin' trophies just to bring the family joy, yeah
Be your own boss, never unemployed, yeah
Springtime, man, that May weather, they gon' call me Floyd, yeah, we the champs
Gotta spark a fire if you comin' with the camp
Drippin', so be careful, it might get a little damp
Movin' like a mailman, finally got a stamp
In my own channel and I'm amped
Oh yeah!

[Hook: 1K Phew]
They must not believe me
I just took it easy
(Huh? Aye) Then turned on the TV
(Huh?) Don't watch me, just watch the TV

[Chorus: 1K Phew]
Live television, goin' live television
Live television, goin' live television
(Huh?) Goin' live like the TV
(Huh?) Don't watch me, just watch the TV

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Wait, I say ok, ok, ok, ok
If they see me fall like OJ, they be toastin' Rosé
When they see me win they quiet, they all be like no sé (shhh)
No comprendo, lo siento, olé, olé, olé
Miss with the bull, yeah, catch me on the tour, yeah
We don't shuck and jive, we tryna give these people tools, yeah
We're so well informed, no, muscled up like Arnold
Terminate the hate and never had to lift an arm
Eastside of Atlanta, used to stay off Moorland Ave
I told Phew I'm on my way, man, he ain't ever pictured that
Put some money on your partner books and look out for your fam
Yeah, they might see me on TV, we just tryna light the path like

[Hook: 1K Phew]
They must not believe me
I just took it easy
(Huh?) Then turned on the TV
(Huh?) Don't watch me, just watch the TV

[Chorus: 1K Phew]
Live television, goin' live television
Live television, goin' live television
(Huh?) Goin' live like the TV
(Huh?) Don't watch me, just watch the TV

[Verse 3: 1K Phew]
We should turn the volume up
I've been shinin' since the sippy cup
I'm 1K and not a cover-up
I'm a winner, not a runner-up
Never sleep 'cause I might miss it if you cross me
People catchin' feelin' 'bout the kid, tryna moss me
Boomerang back, every time they try to toss me
Payin' dues, if I lose, boy, it might cost me
Blessings falling down from the sky, I'm talkin' mayday
First class favour on the way, I'm talkin' Grade A
Friday nights, I think I'm Montell Jordan, Craig, and Day-Day
If you think we lost, you must be next you little pay day

[Hook: 1K Phew]
They would not believe me
I just took it easy
(Huh?) Then turned on the TV
(Huh?) Don't watch me, just watch the TV

[Chorus: 1K Phew]
Live television, goin' live television
Live television, goin' live television
(Huh?) Goin' live like the TV
(Huh?) Don't watch me, just watch the TV
