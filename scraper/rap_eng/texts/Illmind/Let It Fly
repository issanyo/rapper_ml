[Verse 1]
The intro to Belly how we posted
100 on the table, I'm just drawing up the opus
16s like I'm in the stall Tryna load this
Working on a light show, clip full of glow sticks
I'm Sincere how I pens here
With all kinda Iceberg pulled outta thin air
Lil' bit of Murda like if Puff and his men's here
Room full of Inga's and Aaliyah's and Kim's here, you know how this goes
Doors off baby hold all your gold
I sit up inside the pocket like I'm throwing you stones
The doubles the only logic baby, low and behold
Roof tucked, wings up like it's flown off the stove, let it fly
I'm back on my never mind, like never mind these mufuckas they're letting by
Hands on whatever the moment we get inside
Winter's only so the summers can turn into better rides

[Chorus]
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Shit I ain't seen nobody else in my design
I ain't seen nobody up like me and mine
If you seen 'em point 'em out and let em try
Tell 'em let it fly
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Shit I ain't seen nobody else in my design
I ain't seen nobody up like me and mine
If you seen 'em point 'em out and let em try
Tell 'em let it fly

[Verse 2]
You know I can't see less, than a ES, the GS' BS
And I'm from up out the Brook but my women from out the BX
Old habits is hard to die, you know how we get
The motto is a Rover but drop off in a Prius
All in the DNA, juggle a week a day
Music for the looters who perusing thru a B.O.A
Dump it in the Bape store, plug playing keep away
Cribs in Jamaica Estates, Kisha lead the way
Rope tied over the arm the way they rep in here
Pull em off of sweatsuits, call it Nike Tech affairs
Laced it with the Bombay, 6 TVs a system, knocking Conway, all day
And word is I'm long like the arms on Antetokounmpo
Your broad like God we prolly will sumo
Tag all over the walls like I was Hugo
I'm Scorsese off the arm, like let it shoot tho
Blaow!, the aim different
Came for the bag yo the rings came with it
Came for the bag yo the rings came with it
We winning out the bag, either way
Same difference, I tell 'em let it fly

[Chorus]
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Shit I ain't seen nobody else in my design
I ain't seen nobody up like me and mine
If you seen 'em point 'em out and let em try
Tell 'em let it fly
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Shit I ain't seen nobody else in my design
I ain't seen nobody up like me and mine
If you seen 'em point 'em out and let em try
Tell 'em let it fly

[Bridge]
Blaow!, uh, the aim different
Came for the bag yo the rings came with it
Came for the bag yo the rings came with it
We winning out the bag, either way
Same difference, I tell em let it fly

[Chorus]
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Shit I ain't seen nobody else in my design
I ain't seen nobody up like me and mine
If you seen 'em point 'em out and let em try
Tell 'em let it fly
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Let it fly, (let it fly!)
Shit I ain't seen nobody else in my design
I ain't seen nobody up like me and mine
If you seen 'em point 'em out and let em try
Tell 'em let it fly
