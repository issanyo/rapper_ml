[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
They consider this shit backpacking  when a nigga just love rapping
Club packing, word flipping acronym acrobating
Verb spitting and nouns only your mind fathom
Synchronize with the drums on a Illmind's pattern
Long as I got this beating heart, I’m ripping beats apart
I ain't know myself when [???], and still piece of art
No frat boy, no skinny jeans
I’m more like the Fat Boys and Heavy D
In ’86 spitting free in the park
I’ve been patiently waiting
Busting my brain and creating this album making a statement's
An understatement, I’m taking rap flow to a plateau
These assholes you clap fo’
Just  can’t go they mad slow this fast forward
Thinking [mind of mine] be skipping pass those
Theatrical fiascoes in your whack show
I’m baffled by the skill you niggas lack though
Choruses repeating, its boring whatchu speaking
I’m at war with all you heathens
I’m a warrior emceeing. Man I’m killing ‘em


(Samples)
[he’s back give him room to breath]
[Ortiz don’t confuse him with these other cats]
[The best across the board ] [New York]
[When I'm holding this mic I don't just speak]
[he’s back give him room to breath]
[Be proud of me and coming up in rap]
[The best across the board ]
[When I'm holding this mic I don't just speak]


[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Niggas tiptoe around me , bunch of ballerinas
I see ya’ll calling out of work with the coward fever
Shit, I wouldn’t want it  with the Yaowa either
[Man y'all don't hear me tho, Alopecia]
Nigga line a hundred niggas up and watch a hundred niggas drop
In a hundred different spots, bunch of Dalmatians
I play this fire in my drive when I’m riding through your block
Lifting everybody up call that salvation


(Samples)
[he’s back give him room to breath]
[Ortiz don’t confuse him with these other cats]
[The best across the board ] [New York]
[When I'm holding this mic I don't just speak]
[He’s back give him room to breath]
[JO E double L O]
[Another Yaowa chant when I touch the mic]
[When I'm holding this mic I don't just speak]


[Verse 3: Joell Ortiz]
I deliver you from evil when you’re listening to yo’ speakers turned up
Like the club, yeah I get in with my sneakers and my workout [attire]
Feel my dick through these Adidas sweatpants
I don’t dance, two stepping with a liter of whateva
But whateva though I’m clever so you never know
When I’mma leave [that cadence and let Cadence] kick a better flow
