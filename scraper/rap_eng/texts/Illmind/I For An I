[Verse One]
For all those who respect the mine, the feeling is mutual
Spitting the truth out is much more suitable
A proud wise man and I try to stay youthful
Commercial verses underground, brother I'm neutral
Used to the endless debates
The weak mind states
The real and the fake
And many people wonder what motivates my flesh
Yo
Let's take a trip through my thought process
Not the one to talk much but I think a lot
And I can tell if you exercise the brain or not
You be living for the right now
You talk shit about the pioneers
But I hear you like to bite styles
Kill the noise, rebuild them boys and feel the joy
Of spitting skill from your own mind
You will find the originality flowing through
You gotta just do you

[Hook] {x2}
Yo, hip hop's world wide agenda
While Slycemysta's looking out for Edgar
Pleasing everybody?
Ain't no need to try
Watch your own back, eye for an eye

[Verse Two]
As I collect my thoughts it's now time to take action
You can't start matching the physical with just yapping
Got to show and prove
So I chose to move while your whole crew still owe dues
You should please remit or else you won't get shit
No choice but to forfeit and quit
Check your local scene
4/5th are cliques
Won't make it out the state or the city limits
Some cats don't know how to sacrifice
Some too conceited, thinking they that nice
Some in they own world with no focus
And yes, some are just afraid of success
My long term goal to be one of the very best
With the ultimate, audio your mind has ever met
First impression, I hope many will love my work
But Floe gotta approve it first

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Life long education
Right beside a strong dedication
Make a tight song instead of fakin'
You gotta maintain an ill mind
Cause the road of life remains undefined
Yeah the questions, trial and error
Learn the lessons
Get that strength
Steady building to your profession
You better tweak them skills yo
New comers wanna take your spot for real though
Slowing up? Never
Birds do flock together
But you on the wrong path, flying north for the winter
Trust all your instincts if you wanna be a winner
You going nowhere being a great contender
I see a lot of y'all just wandering without aim
All you envision is fame
Man your brain is fogged up, your physical is so shook
Looking out for self is a good look

[Hook]
