[Verse One] [Silent Knight]:
Ayo fam I'm a grown man
My grammar could go hand in hand with the best out
But I'm stressed out with this old plan
Examine the whole damn perimeter
No chance for amateurs
I won't stand to be made a character of
I give a damn what your caliber was
I'm embarrassing punks
Starvin' like a pack of some mutts
Know exactly what's up
I ain't tryin' to suffer I love my life
But hittin' up the rich and corrupt? Now that's a Hunger Strike
Buggin' like
There ain't nothin' nice these cats can say since back in the day
I've been nicer than cats my age
Now I'm back to take what's rightfully mine (get it)
Any track or stage or cipher I shine
It's a brief introduction for those that don't know
Just a small fast set of the whole arsenal
Still I have sweat, tears, heart and soul
And that's a promise
Every single bar is gold

[Hook] [East]:
That's how we hit 'em
Somebody better get 'em
Just rock to the rhythm
We're tryin' to keep it movin' aaaaand
We hit 'em
Somebody better get 'em
Just rock to the rhythm
We're tryin' to keep it movin'
Let's go

[Verse Two] [Skyzoo]:
Differ, Scott done risen
Stand still if you want, I'll body your position
I told y'all to look out, I'm buzzin'
But you ain't seen it comin'/cummin' like a porn star forgettin' to pull out
Pause
Pushin' 2-20 on the meter
And y'all, is sittin' too comfy with your feet up
Cause dawg
I'll pull the rug right from under you like
"What the fuck you gon' do besides call Jesus?"
And as far as that go, I'm Jesus in the flesh when it comes to rap flows
Except I pack chrome
So go long if you a football fan
Mayor of the Corner Store from the Brooknam land
Me
I do a show, get my doe, split the scene
And end up in your bitch mouth like Listerine
Skyzoo, and no one in your crew come close
Owner of the yellow school bus flow
It's retarded

[Hook]

[Verse Three] [Emilio Rojas]:
Y'all need to start makin' peace with your God
Cause a beast has arrived so all sheep see a priest to confide
While y'all speakin' in confessional chambers
We've been after the stars like three kings being led to the manger
Speech rings with the breath of an angel
Cause the verse and bars are the word of God like New Testament pages
Lessons for ages to learn
Take the stage that I burn
Put these cats to the stake like saints, ashes placed in an urn
Challenge your faith plus I'mma leave you in doubt
Leave your status in place, everything you preachin' about
? of anything you dreamin' about
A gatekeeper like St. Peter and I'm keepin' you out
? with drums, uh
I spill rhymes to kill time, ain't no speakin' in tongues
I will shine if you sleepin' on us
You'll be fallin' from grace like a deacon when he leap or he jump

[Hook]
