[Hook: Cee & Aria Zenua]
[Aria Zenua] No conversation
[Cee] It's like I dived into her head but homie nothing was said, we had
[Aria Zenua] No conversation
[Cee] I'm looking right into her eyes but all I'm hearing is the silence, there's
[Aria Zenua] No conversation
[Cee] And not a word was uttered, our bodies had a discussion, there was
[Aria Zenua] No conversation
[Cee] And word life, I'm just glad we involved, so I’ma let it evolve

[Verse 1: Cee]
Yeah, coz all I'm wanting is a partner y'all
Someone who can hold me down, and I rely upon
Not a woman whom respect that I might accord
I'm tryina find a Megan Good type that I be dyin' for
She got a strong mind and man she challenge me with it
Independent, yeah she embody the definition
Cool and suave, she smooth and calm me
When the stress is getting too hectic, dude she got me
Uh, on the real, I can picture it now
The cameras flashing when we out on the town
With her hand in mine and god damn she fine
And folks is staring, I don't care because I'm lost in her, I'm staring too
Honey let's play life like its Monopoly
Stuntin’ off of nothin’, but the love we do it properly
Ma, we got the whole world waiting for me and you
And yo I didn't say a word, it's like she already knew it, we had

[Verse 2: Cee]
Yeah, so I'm thinking I done found her y'all
It's like she heard what I was sayin’, she all of that and more
Dude my head swayin’, this chick is a 10 here
Feels as new as 10 days, as comfortable as 10 years
And ain't a need for those subliminal hints
Man we even seem to agree on all the trivial things
I guess my luck just amped up, and what
I'm sayin’ she beyond any standards, she everything a man want
Sometimes we getting to talking until the high is landing
And other times we be chillin’, we have an understanding
I swear she hit me like a slow addiction
Keep the conversation light, Speak Easy, Prohibition
Yeah, words are overrated anyway
And how I see it, why talk when I can demonstrate?
So I figure I’ma keep this one
Mouth shut, dog she knowin’ what's up, no doubt we had

[Verse 3: Aria Zenua]
Communication, 90% body language
You know (you know), like I know (like I know)
After staring in your eyes, it’s gonna be you and I
Love the stimulation
Yes I, prefer no conversation
You make it real for a woman like me (like me)
Rough with the right amount of sensitivity (ooh wee)
Align with my vision and creativity
You know you got me (you got me), you got me (you got me)
I make it real for a man like you
Standing by your side while you do what you do
Keeping the loving real and the energy true
There was no need for
