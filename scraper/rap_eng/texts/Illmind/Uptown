[Intro: Andy Mineo]
New York City
New York City
New York City
New York City

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Uptown, New York City, where you can spot me
Uptown, New York City, where you can spot me
Uptown, New York City, where you can spot me
Uptown, New York City

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Look, we in love with the invention, we don't love the inventor
On a quiet block, they puff the loud, it be smellin' like it's Denver
And they hit you with the fake smile, I ain't talkin' dentures
Starbucks on the corner, pushin' bucks for that rent up, uh
Dippin' in all black like I'm venom
Keep it G, I'm not a star, but I'm raw like this denim
Them dope boys push the big body, Jerome Bettis
I got Santería hexes from my exes, but I'm protected
You heard that man got shot for his necklace?
That's a 1-8-7 up on 1-8-7, uh
You know that uptown lifestyle reckless
When they eatin' mangú and fried cheese for your breakfast
Baby, how you gon' complete your life checklist
Spendin' every night watchin' Netflix?
Time is so precious, gotta invest it where you spend it
If we prisoners to comfort, we judge our own sentence
I be uptown

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
Uptown, New York City, where you can spot me
Uptown New York City, where you can spot me
Uptown New York City, where you can spot me
Uptown New York City

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
Yeah, look
Alright, I wake up in that mornin', gettin' that café con leche
Doña, hold that azucar, my stomach been showin' lately
Plus the crossover crazy, don't get caught out here sleepin'
That's why they call me Allen Irishman when I ball at Cabrini
I'm throwin' swishes
This right here that new school vintage
I been spendin' money tryin' not to spend up all these minutes
And I ain't been present, man, look at what my gift is
Some push the white cause they ain't have the privilege
Let's get it!
Ain't no other city like the one I'm in
I got that Bustelo in my cup again
Jim Carey with this here, I'm goin' dumb again
Me, myself and I, the only thing I'm up against
New York stayin' lit, rent high, payin' it
La Marina by the water, date night favorite
My bodega on the corner, I ain't even sayin' it
They already know my order, they just started makin' it, woah!

[Bridge: Andy Mineo & Willow Stephens]
Alright, ain't no other city make me feel this way
I been all around the world, baby, but I'm here to stay
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Ain't no other city make me feel this way
I been all around the world, baby, but I'm here to stay
Oh-oh-oh-oh
There's no place like Uptown, New York
Alright, ain't no other city make me feel this way
I been all around the world, baby, but I'm here to stay
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
There's no place like Uptown, New York

[Outro: Flaco Navaja]
Padre mio!
Padre mio!
Protégeme en las calles!
Guarda mi mente
Porque el mundo
Porque el mundo miente
