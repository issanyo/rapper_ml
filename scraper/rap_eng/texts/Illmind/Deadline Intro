[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you all, to what we like to call...
The Deadline, Deadline
Bad Luck is over now. A lot of beautiful things been goin' down
This is for everybody that's been down from day one (day one) day one (day one)
To all the naysayers and nonbelievers, you got a few months to start believing
That's your deadline. Ha, yeah

Your times up, lucks runnin' out
Your times up, lucks runnin' out
People wanna know when the album is coming out
Your times up, lucks runnin' out
The deadline, deadline
The deadline, deadline
Deadline, deadline
Huh? What? The deadline

Listen
I heard all of those comments
Yeah, all the talk and the rumors
Look, let me get it straight now
I got a new fam, new label, new style, new sound, who's down?
I think you've been misinformed and hoodwinked
Cause I've been on the move longer than some of y'all would think
Before +The Williams+ shit was boomin' in your ears
I was puttin' in ground work for numerous years
I persevered, fist fought my way in the game
Baby powder pimp slap y'all for sayin' my name
Takin' subliminal shots, but I'm sorry you missed the target
So let's get it started, peace to Greenville, Charlotte
N.C., S.C., down south, let's see
Niggas on the ASR, MPC and SP
Yes we get it live, I got it sewn up
The deadlines approaching, times almost up

The deadline
The deadline, deadline
The deadline, deadline

It's time to start the show

"For some reason I've been given a second chance
So, I'm taking my work underground
I can't let it fall into the wrong hands"
