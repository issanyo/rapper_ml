[Chorus: Lovele$$]
Trap nigga keep-keep pumping
Trap nigga keep-keep pumping
Trap nigga keep-keep pumping
Trap nigga keep-keep pumping
Working Monday to Sunday
Working Monday to Sunday
Better not play with my money
Better not play with my money

[Verse 1: Lovele$$]
Federal investigation, monetary conversation
Slangin' all these fish scales got me taking hoes across nation
Dope price  go up call that inflation
Malibu with the skrrt skrrt call that vacation
Verizon activation real nigga celebration
When I feel the sensation choppa sing like the  temptation
Drug negotiations ion need no donations
New spot doing so good 'imma need another location
G-5 elevation, v-12 acceleration
Your bitch and my bitch mad 'cause I'm bad at communication
Leaning less conversation, fuckin' up concentration
Must have been your imagination you were just decoration

[Chorus: Lovele$$]
Trap nigga keep-keep pumping
Trap nigga keep-keep pumping
Trap nigga keep-keep pumping
Trap nigga keep-keep pumping
Working Monday to Sunday
Working Monday to Sunday
Better not play with my money
Better not play with my money

Took a loss get my whole weight up, look ma nigga got his trap back
Hit the block just like Tetris pussy nigga don't wanna test this

Finesse finesse, I got the best the best
Used to work for that hoe, they used to bust my chest
Then I ran into the plug he showed me so much, love
