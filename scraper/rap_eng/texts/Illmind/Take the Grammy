[Hook]
They used to make fun, chuckle at my craft
I used to skip hoops, Now I skip class
Once weak and frail, now vigorous and strong
I used to take shit, now stand and respond
Spent too many hours had to many rows
Just to raise the white flag and throw in the towel
I smell that grammy that grammys in my grasp
Tell everyone at the top my arrival is eminent and to watch their backs

[Verse 1]

Walking out of asylums with blood on my hands
Shutter island with silence as far as the stands
Sightings of half human, half beast fuming
Flew of the handle somebody go and  dial  the police
Murdering messing with pros im not an amateur
Piles of body fatal harm massive blood massacre
If you dont want to be in danger then bow down to your leader
Staples in my eyes I'm as stable as Santa Maria
Sanctioned my task to carry out and complete
Decisions tough but no calamity's
But if i disagree, i will not be discreet
My anecdotes are in better shape then athletes
Im not after beef, that shit to strenuous
Attention on me  im not trying to
Sound sententious
Studios are church's ,beats are foundations
My voice a instrument to be intricate   and courageous


[Hook]

[Verse 2]
No longer tip toeing round dragons caves
Sharping my daggers im ready to slay
Dig out the graves and pursuance the coffins
You can survive who you codding everyone know I'm the problem
Modest or just plain headed, i will their jaws dropped
Yeah i leave them astonished
And really only using the tools i was handed
You find me top the iceberg is where im standing
And never will i fall into any puddle
And fitting every piece piece to the puzzle
As long as led in my pencil, Will be lead by these angels
Through the fog and mist I remain grateful and faithful
My skin is insulation, my brain a machine programmed
For one purpose to simply live out my dream
Leave my environment, venom in my veins
Leave my environment
My assignment is to leave them silenced

[Hook]
