[Verse One: Stro Elliott]
In the morning I rise to news about a woman gettin' brutalized
Drive by shooters and drugs and teen suicide
I get a sickening feeling for three seconds
Then exhale, dwell on the words that God left in my heart
I was born with a spark, we born with a flame
To burn, the lessons I learned on secular terms
Losin' my firm grip on the world
The battle zone
Even when I'm not at home fightin' to bring the cattle home
There's no confusin' that I'm God's for the usin'
Though my thoughts be gettin' foolish and it's hard not to do it
And I admit I was wrong for assumin'
That I was stronger than a student
Unflawed as a human, yeah
But God knew it and he offered a solution
Wasn't long in confusion, I'm in awe feelin' stupid
Cause it's oh so simple ya see
I ain't dead to sin, but the sun/son shined and died for me
Yo, no matter how hard it gets
We can't do it if we ain't got God in this
With this mic
We've been given a tool
To find truth and we give it to you and you
Yo, it's high powered

[Hook]
It's high powered y'all

[Verse Two: Mr. J. Mederios]
Higher power
You're never really out of His range
Behind the stars lies a meaning and a reason for change
We in the season for rain, whether or not we see it the same
We gettin' wet, the threat of the evening remains
And you can bet I believe in the name of the Son
He won't let me be deceived in the days to come
You wanna rap to receive cause the pay is none
And if it's wisdom that I need let me pray for some
Our Father in Heaven my heart is begging for healing
Start my engine, I'm parked confessing my feelings
It's dark, I'm headed but now I'm bending and kneeling
The art of lettin' it go and lettin' you receive them
Forgive us the ways of men
Deliver us from the days we in
Keep me living till the day you say when
And all of this in your name I pray
I pray
Amen

Amen {x 20}

[Hook]
It's high powered y'all
