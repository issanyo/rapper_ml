Verse 1
Biblical divides, addicts in fist fights
Precise eyes got you walkin on thin ice
Crack, smackin you outta your disguise
Pissed my, chances by hittin this liq..I
Diss thy, whos runnin his mouth when
Fountains are outed as being a mountain
To those who without em, doubt em
 But who built those buildings
Cover your children while you make a killin
Villains, pillaged our villages, still in
History books and depicted as billin'
Us who in debt Depreciate in the millions
Poisoned in thought and then forced us to give in
Britains written hate for my Christians
Risen outta the darkness ive lived in
System, depression spawned an addiction
Now you goin tell me that we have been gifted


Hook
They wanted to shut this shit down
But we said oh no
They wanted to build on our ground
But we said oh no


Verse 2
Agency benchmarks Slavery Stretchmarks
Cadences vacant, been savin my best art
Pester, like they did to the falklands 
Now its 06 with the killins and robbins
Often, my city done charted, exhausted
Bossin, this flow they gonna say that ive lost it
Crossin, you ever been to a mosque n (fuck it)
Sat wit the people absorbing
The culture people enriched with a fortune
No money, that value is torched in
The Qu'ran but you callin it dogma
Your dogshit but yet you dwell on the former
Loathing enforcers since i was like 12
Harrassments in fashion yeah i had no help
 the records on shelves, was reppin my hell
Can't threaten me with jail all ive known is a cell



Hook
They wanted to shut this shit down
But we said oh no
They wanted to build on our ground
But we said oh no


Verse 3
Biblical divides, addicts in fist fights
Thats all ive known so chasing a rich life
Bitch i, might just end up in this life
A kingpin, delinquent  who knows what im thinkin
Drinkin, tonic we onit my conscious is sinkin
Blinkin, decade off 30
Its early, jazz why do you worry?
You start to concern me, your visions is blurry
Deter me, from reachin the peak of existence
The greatest persistence not cover the distance
For instance, say you ain't making it out
Say you ain't rakin amounts
What would you do
What would you do?

I dont know


Hook
They wanted to shut this shit down
But we said oh no
They wanted to build on our ground
But we said oh no
