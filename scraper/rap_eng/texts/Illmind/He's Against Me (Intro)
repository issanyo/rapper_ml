When i'm drinking it's all shots and not sips
I just block you out son, eclipse
Since nfl blitz i been seeing tits
I'm not acting or playing CAL ain't ever been a script
Ripped off medicinal, your girl can get a pistol full
Overdue no minimal, kinda always cynical
Never been subliminal an outright criminal
Mothafucka, i finally reached the pinnacle

22 years it took to manifest
Now finally ya mans the best
Fuck the rest like a bitch with no standards
Commander an primetime like deion sanders
Holy field of my own first name ain't evander
Lackin manners no construction workers goons be packing hammers
Give me a gander, i'm not a good character
She calls me her gladiator never been fair to her
Only cause she's glad i ate her
These neighbors chickens like they grewup in incubators
Blacked out darth vader, serving you like waiters
Are these persons or haters? your boys come to enjoy
Growing paranoid, trying to a-void
Become less social even though i got the best vocals
Total exhaustion, but i know that i'm worthy
Before i'm in a coffin want rings like coughlin

Why are all these people still coming for me me?
Dont wana be another biggie story
Why are all these people still coming for me me
Dont wana be another pac story
Why are all these people still coming for me me
Dont wana be another big l story
Why are all these people still coming for me me
Dont wana end up like eyedea story



Hits barreling like dimaggio, where's my monroe?
You got no dough, all your raps blow bro
I'm wearing polo, gassed up son-o-co
The one so-lo, all the hoes know
U have no idea, young rocky biamilla
A g i be a, u flimsey i -kea
Blunts fat as fa-jitas, in charge like vi-sa
They like damn son since bantam
This mans the one throwin tantrums
And some, you know i got a brag a little
This bitch some eye candy like a bag of skittles
The middle console the bread is in
Brighter then edison, pumpin adrenaline
The reginimin, fuck over my associate
It ain't appropriate look how low she get
Never quit, grindin like bob burnquist
Young diablo grab a blunt to burn an twist
Piece of shit?  I'm at least the shit
The whole kitten coodable
Putting poison in your ramen noodles
Ima pitbull whos stoppin poodles
Putting white cream on hoes like they're toaster strudels
So tootles, to believin in karma
Sends shots at anybody even in armor
I want a see a better fucking liter you can ask farva
Been huffing on ether since a larva
All my pro-teges are like yo-no-way
I'm way to dope i hate you folks
I take two tokes and make you jokes
Lyrically you can clearly see
The unfairly apparanty I'm the heir to the
Fake throne i take clones, leave em decapatied
Fried off vaporization livin in a hater nation
