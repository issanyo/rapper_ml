I got 20 bands worth of tats
Now I don't need no mothafuckin’ Rolex
I got 20 bands worth of tats
Now I don't need no mothafuckin' Rolex
I got 20 bands worth of...

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
I’m skatin' through the city in some dirty Vans
Tatted like the fuckin' Warped Tour: 30 band
Where my murda fam? Yeah, it's Fort Apache for life
You can't afford it if you askin' the price
So I don't be bringin' ’em where I live
Ain’t bringin' ’em into they crib
Instead I be bringin' 'em into the tele
Then I be gettin' up into they ribs, okay
Like Adam and Eve, hittin’ it adamantly, they lovin' the tats
So many women wanna get in the straddle of me
So I told her better hold that, then I go back
And I stroke that but I don't fuck with no girls
With a MK or a Coach bag, so live it up
But baby, you in my world, y'all want suicide doors
I got suicide girls and all my women known freaks
Even when they ass naked, they get full sleeves
Yeah, you know me, I give a damn about the cash that we blow
My skin lookin' like a gallery show

[Verse Two: Hi-Tone]
20 on my skin, 20 on my wrist, 20 on my neck
Lookin' like Picasso in this bitch (bitch!)
I done seen a whole lot of insecure men at my spot
While I tat on they bitch (bitch!)
Everybody lookin' for a plug, I don't need a plug
I got me some plugs in my ears (ears!)
I know me a couple real homies, caught a couple bodies
Got a couple tattoo tears (ooh)
But I don't give a fuck, mama got mad 'cause I tat my body up
Couple Benz records and we got Rollie'd up
And you don't wanna trip hard, homies in the truck
This ain't a fad, this a lifestyle, this is permanent
This is murder with no fuckin' trial, this is not a joke
Heath Ledger with a fuckin' smile
Heath Ledger with a fuckin' smile
