[Verse 1 – Boaz]
I used to dream of that V dozen six double zero
The quickest recipe to get it was to cut a kilo
Young boss nigga, respecting my OG though
Buying lotto tickets and chips at the casino
That’s what we call finessing, salad with the dressing
Hard headed, bout that cheddar nigga, I ain’t learned my lesson
Blaze tire, burn fire, while I fire off the Wesson
Burn fire, stay higher nigga, I ain’t ever stressing
Counting every blessing, counting every second
What’s on my mind is money, it’s time to cash the check in
One zero zero comma one zero zero comma
Keep on running up the numbers
Fuck these haters and they mamas
These lil niggas still wearing their pajamas
With the feet in em, ain’t no street in em
I already kill em with the blow, time to kill em with the flow
Illmind let the beat hit em

[Hook - Boaz]
We rocking on the mic like this
Like this the place that I belong
Everytime I rock a mic like this
I rock it all night long
Yo, don't I been whipping in the Benz like this
Like it's the whip that I belong
Everytime I drive a whip like this
I take a bad bitch home

[Verse 2 – Crooked I]
Shady 2.0, we them monsters
I'm either with the slaughters or walking with ten copsters
When I'm in Detroit, that shit is kinda ironic
I'm eating Alfredo with Marshall discussing imposters
You niggas counterfeit twenties, live your life like a dyke
Cause when it come to beef, nah, you ain’t down to get busy
I let off a chopper round, spin your block around
Your whole town’ll get dizzy huh?
Like a merry go round, if we ain’t rocking turn your stereo down
I still grind on my rap shit, the gun is still mine when the strap kick
It sound like an Illmind black kick, clap shit
Like, it’s Crooked I
Same west coaster, who got ya?
BM in my DM, meeting at 9 PM
She gon be on her knees son, like Liam

[Hook]

[Verse 3 – Sean Price]
Boot camp, the team that roll
Big numbers with the same move, Kareem Abdul
Top of the game, so far papa knocking his cane
[?] I see is a green being
Extreme mean, meaner than mean
Mediocre motherfucker is something you [?]
Skat [?] dooby, he can truly eat the vet, brother Tech, wearing Louis sneakers
Respect to the maximum
In the tech tech 22 shooting rapid son
Nosy niggas taste talent
Catch me from the key, your big Ray Allen
I woke up and slapped my mom
She ran out yelling “help, something wrong with Sean”
Sean is wrong, shoot shit Sean is on
Arm being strong, the chrome [?]

[Hook]

[Verse 4 – Chevy Woods]
MJ from where ever nigga, I’m nice with it
Bet that oil lock up when the ice hit it
Uh, it’s that gold ropes velour music
56 in the pot, and I ain’t tryna lose it
Word, you niggas stuck tryna make a dollar
Word, my niggas stuck ducking Impalas
Word, and all of y’all lightweight
Get cold feet when I come around like ice skates
Hell yeah I’m tryna body you all
You chop the head then the body will fall
You need a van and a morgue
A couple hazmat suits and it’s on
Fucking with me, what the fuck is you on?
Know that this kid is strong
Rap niggas out here doing the pills
The heat is on, but do it in chill
You weirdos can’t box with G’s
And all snitches love freedom of speech
Fuck them niggas
