[Intro]
El pueblo unido jamás será vencido
El pueblo unido jamás será vencido
El pueblo unido jamás será vencido
[Verse 1]
This that high society
High philosophy
Fulfill gods prophecy
That new technology
Aim it y'all way probably
Spread equality
Through songs of quality
New Illuminati
Peace with Allah and Saudi
Buddha and body
Jehovah and Yeezus
Praise to all mighty Jesus
The broduses and Cesars
The real and deceivas
Tryna deceive us
Sparking curiosity
Doing it properly
Verses Greek mythology
Lyrical Zeus
Cronus we rebuke
Hate to Lucifer sorry
God enlightened new Illuminati
[Hook]
New Illuminati
New Illuminati
New Illuminati
[Verse 2]
Young grown 16 bars you just a fetus
Born a decade after DMC wore Adidas
I'm Malcolm meets Don Juan
Mind far gone
Corporations devious
CEOs mischievous
Niggas shooting for in god we trust
Girls showing out they bust
Ice the just
Get our fucking rights back we must
Welcome to the revolution
Knowledge is key it's been proven
Low school system commit more crimes
Better school system build better minds
But that's not gonna happen probably
Welcome New Illuminati
