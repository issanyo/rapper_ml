[Verse 1]
Man, fuck around and I just might
I just might go up to the Heights on my new bike, painted Spyder white
Pull up on your bitch, an indictment like
Helmet half off and get some head later on inspired by the pipes
Or I just might, hit a spot on Steinway right, see the vibe is like
Tell 'em bring a few bottles over but don't provide the light
Get the aluminum pole and fire right
And smoke ? and hookah the entire night
I just might fill my truck up with some lady friends
Front on the hood like the Mercedes Benz sign
You ain't ever seen this kind, they all Canadians
That'll hop out this whip with big apples like the state we in
Nigga I just might say fuck and slide up to Harlem and check my nigga PO
Post up right on his corner and light a cigarillo
It's a million fish in the sea up there, I chase mine while sippin' the Nemo

[Hook]
Wait, wait up
I just wanna, I just wanna pull up in a Benz
Fuck around with shorty, tell her she can bring a friend
Got a couple thousand layin' 'round that I can spend
Wait, wait up
I just wanna, I just wanna pull up in a Benz
Fuck around with shorty, tell her she can bring a friend
Got a couple thousand layin' 'round that I can spend
Wait, wait up

[Verse 2]
I just might do a business dinner in my slippers
Be 30 minutes late and then show up with a stripper
Pay the whole check in cash and tell the owner he should tip her
I'm grown, call me Mr
I just might rock this mean hat that I bought
Throw on some clean basketball shorts
Hit a Nets game, give Jay Z dap at halfcourt
Then slide to 40/40 for a shot of Jack and take off
Or I just might make my jeweler make a piece at 4 in the morn'
Tell him meet me outside the club and throw the shit on
Have it swingin' in the afty, swing on you if you tap me
Bloody your khakis
I just might do what I fuckin' like
Fuck shorty cause her and my ex look fuckin' alike
And do shit in the bed that my ex wouldn't like
And fly my ex in on the next fuckin' flight, fuckin' right

[Hook]
Wait, wait up
I just wanna, I just wanna pull up in a Benz
Fuck around with shorty, tell her she can bring a friend
Got a couple thousand layin' 'round that I can spend
Wait, wait up
I just wanna, I just wanna pull up in a Benz
Fuck around with shorty, tell her she can bring a friend
Got a couple thousand layin' 'round that I can spend
Wait, wait up
Wait, wait up
Wait, wait up
Wait, wait up
I just wanna, I just wanna pull up in a Benz
Fuck around with shorty, tell her she can bring a friend
Got a couple thousand layin' 'round that I can spend
Wait, wait up
I just wanna, I just wanna pull up in a Benz
Fuck around with shorty, tell her she can bring a friend
Got a couple thousand layin' 'round that I can spend
Wait, wait up
