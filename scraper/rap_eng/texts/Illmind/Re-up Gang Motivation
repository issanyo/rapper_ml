[Verse 1: Ab-Liva]
Two-door, four-door, sedan, roadster
Cabriolet convertible, careening in the coaster
Christian Louboutin, straps is like a holster
We balling -- ESPN highlights, posters
Tangerine Lambos, Mimosa, raise a toast
We at the Grammys, then Miami playing Boca like it's poker
Had a room at the La Quinta, full of soldiers, full of coca
Feel a ulcer, hundred grand up in the sofa, reupholstered
I am twisted, I am Heath Ledger, Joker to you jokers
If you Tony, I hang up, send a hit, I am Sosa
I am cultured, I am legend, I am Liva, I am closer
To the best writer alive, other two, I'm the closest
No holsters, no chauffeurs, no mask, no witness
No corpus, no guts, no glory, no joking
All-Star we play -- C-I-two A
And 2 Chainz, with my bad bitch -- it's my b-day
This life that we live is for the connoisseurs
Carnival, Gansevoort everyday poolside cabana floss
Mami in Manolo's, I'm in that Gucci polo
With the multi-color collar moving dolo on my solo
My niggas that's in prison, I'm they eyes I'm they ears
Every champagne night for every laugh there's a tear
There's a picture being shown in every jail, every tier
Representin' so my niggas know I'm here
Polaroids being shown in every jail, every tier
Representin' all my niggas know I shared from the heart
