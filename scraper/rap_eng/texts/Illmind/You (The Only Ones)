[Verse 1: Myone]
Elegant thoughts travel at Godspeed on a plane
Headed to the west coast, so [?] are tellin' my seeds
Daddy gotta leave, no need to cry, wipe your eyes
Little girl, my priceless pearl, surrounded by them diamonds
You in school still shinin' while I'm on the road signing
Autographs, finding time to sleep between days and doing shows
And interviews, checking out the flyest venues
I send you my love my beautiful queen, you represent the beauty in me
Understand this life is hard work for me
I slice the game, cut it open like surgery
Missing my fam, constantly on the road
Damn near driving with my eyes closed, so much love from my soul
A brother gettin' old, but shit don't stop
Gotta make the body rock, poppin' and lockin'
Freestylin' till the break of dawn in the early mornin'
Wake up and take a shower, hit the road and do it again

[Chorus]
This is for you and you and you and you and you and you...
Somethin' to grow to with nothin' to hold to
This is for you and you and you and you and you and you...
Just let it control you, we bringin' the soul through
This is for you and you and you and you and you and you...
Somethin' to grow to with nothin' to hold to

[Pre-Verse Ad-Lib: Myth]
Ayo, peace to Aaliyah

[Verse 2: Myth]
My Cinderella, losing her glass slipper
What was your last thought, your final word, or whisper?
I woulda stood in line for hours just to hug and kiss ya
Soul sisters sold ya, fantasize 'bout being a mister
If you a misses [?] who could be prouder?
A million men feelin' the same, can't say it louder
I've been drowning in my thoughts for hours, days to months
And now my bottle's bone dry and I'm completely outta blunts
So I guess I gotta face it, race to replace the painted traces
Erased it from the tainted page of this basic arrangement
You got it better so if I could I wouldn't change it
You out of reach from the evil, terrorism, and hatred
Hopefully, I'll approach you at Heaven's Gate
If fifty-thousand people die, they'll be saying ten elevate
And I'll be one outta that ten-thou', speakin' to my pen pal
To you for my own and your Fairs, Jews, and Gentiles
'Cause we love you

[Chorus]
This is for you and you and you and you and you and you...
Somethin' to grow to with nothin' to hold to
This is for you and you and you and you and you and you...
Just let it control you, we bringin' the soul through
This is for you and you and you and you and you and you...
Somethin' to grow to with nothin' to hold to

[Pre-Verse Ad-Lib: Symbolyc 1]
To the fam

[Verse 3: Symbolyc 1]
Similar to writin' a letter
It's so excitin' and never will I cry tears
In light in the mess to travel these dry years together
Fightin how I bury these cold fears of terror inside of me
Some back out while other, victims of poverty
Told me to stand firm, residin' on Gods property
And y'all can holla with me whenever
I'm only a phone call away from [?] forever so don't get it twisted
My fam's the most important of all things in existence
Though the music pulls me away at times in the distance
I pray that God bless ya, mums and dad I hope I never stressed ya
Out, without a doubt told me to handle the pressure
Thanking meditation because Satan will test ya
Give an order like God, not anything lesser
'Cause, 'cause, 'cause

[Chorus]
This is for you and you and you and you and you and you...
Somethin' to grow to with nothin' to hold to
This is for you and you and you and you and you and you...
Just let it control you, we bringin' the soul through
This is for you and you and you and you and you and you...
Somethin' to grow to with nothin' to hold to

[Outro: [?]]
Yeah. These days have changed, you know what I'm sayin'? We're still tryna feel good. 'Song right here is all love. Doin' this for y'all: fam, fans, anybody who all over the rise, you know what I'm sayin'? Puttin' it down, down here in Texas. All a' y'all, peace.
