Yeah, it's gettin' wild out here
It makes me wonder how a black man could ever raise a child out here
You know the old krumbsnatcha's in this land of decay
So why we killin' for the crumbs when there's so much at stake?
We're no longer suposed to be slaves
I bet Harriet Tubman will be turnin' in her grave
Like remind my soul

Of the time we were great before the self hate

My elders all feel the same there's no bravery
We're supposed to fight for freedom not just the end of slavery
Are we too selfish to even bless the kids with jewels
So our youth don't get played out for fools?
Will they get program how to behave?
Malcolm X must be turnin' in his grave
Like remind my soul

Of the time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate (x3)
The time we were great
Wait, we still great, but

I met up with this dread, said "Peace, Respect"
He said "Respect? Me not seen that around here yet
Black man kill himself for limited amount of wealth
And them disrespecting women so him disrespect himself"
I agree for what the dread had to get off of his chest
Bob Marley will be disturbed from his rest
Like remind my soul

Of the time we were great before the self hate

Can't work a dead end 9 to 5 for what
To be another victim of social security cuts?
I gotta cut myself from the chains and run free
Empower myself to be my own authority
People die so I don't have to be a runaway slave
Nat Turner must be turnin' in his grave
Like remind my soul

Of the time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate (x3)
The time we were great
Wait, we still great, but

We're taught to worship these rappers and athletes and actors
Many who think they better and they walk right past ya
It's what you do off camera and off the court
That really makes you worthy of the people support
But some brothers get those millions and forget how to behave
Arther Ashe must be turnin' in his grave
Like remind my soul

Of the time we were great before the self hate

We crabs in a barrel, you ain't gettin out until I do first
And that's why the guns burst
Whatever happened to strength in numbers?
Some of the greatest minds on the planet are among us
But so many start on strugglin' and never get saved
Man, Martin must be turnin' in his grave
Like remind my soul

Of the time we were great before the self hate
The time we were great before the self hate (x3)
The time we were great

Remind my soul
Of the time we were great before the self hate yo
Yeah
