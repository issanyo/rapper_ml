[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Why is it so hard to love you?
Why is it so hard to love you?
You make it easy, but I make it hard
Oh my God
You take the blame when I don't deserve it, no, no
I break your heart, then I do it again, do it again
You give me patience when I keep you waitin'
I don't know why you call me your favorite

[Refrain: Andy Mineo]
Are we for real or not? (tell me, tell me)
For real or not? (tell me, tell me)
Are we for real or not, I gotta know
(Tell me, tell me)

[Pre-Hook: Andy Mineo]
You're givin' me all you have
You saw me without my mask
But I can't change my past
So can you promise this gon' last?

[Hook: Mac Powell]
Make me a believer
Cause all I've ever seen is pain
Make me a believer
Promise me I'm not the same
Make me a believer

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
They tell me seein' is believin'
But all ever saw was the schemin'
All I ever saw was the people that I loved
They was gettin' up and leaving, throwin' peace signs
What's up, what's up, aye (tell me, tell me)
What's up lately?
How did you love me?
You stayed when I went buggin', you stayed
It's messin' with my head now, it's messin' with my head
Why you haven't left now?
I still can't guess, tell me

[Refrain: Andy Mineo]
Are we for real or not? (tell me, tell me)
For real or not? (tell me, tell me)
Are we for real or not, I gotta know
(Tell me, tell me)

[Pre-Hook: Andy Mineo]
You're givin' me all you have
You saw me without my mask
But I can't change my past
So can you promise this gon' last?

[Hook: Mac Powell]
Make me a believer
Cause all I've ever seen is pain
Make me a believer
Promise me I'm not the same
Make me a believer

[Outro: Kelly Shahbazian]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
