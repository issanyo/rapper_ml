We will give you what we came to give you
Where we gonna take you
To another place where we can elevate your mind
All The Way
Girl I'm gonna make you hit your soul
And make you feel it
Take you all the way inside
Baby
All The Way
Make you move it
Make you feel it
Put your hands up in the air
And let your troubles go away
We're gonna make you feel real good inside

Ay yo, everything is everything
Love is the light of my heart
Get rid of the heavy thing
I will forever sing
Forever will bring
And never come between
The terror of life and better things
This is my medique
That lifts off the scene from
Music is my everything
We enter my kingdom
God bless

We will give you what we came to give you
Where we gonna take you to another place where we can elevate your mind
All The Way
Girl I'm gonna make you hit your soul and make you feel it
Take you all the way inside
Baby
All The Way
Make you move it
Make you feel it
Put your hands up in the air
And let your troubles go away
We're gonna make you feel real good inside

Yo, feel on this

I want to be free
How free?
Ay yo, free as can be
I want to walk the streets without all the jealousy
So what you're selling me?
Pennies for my thoughts?
Dimes for the stress?
Incense to relax this pain up in my chest?
Bless your soul
I've seen it all kid
Generation after generation we continue to fall
Give me a call if you want to talk
We're like brothers, kid
Let's build
And continue to live
All the way
All the way
All the way
All the way
Yo

This is the song of inspiration
For the many who have not experienced the ups and downs what is life and love
So many choices we can make
But what you need to do is take your time
And figure A through D
Or all of the above
To some my diction may sound foreign
No, I hope I ain't borin'
What I'm trying to do is fit your mental like a glove
In hopes that you might understand
That joy and pain go hand-in-hand
Until demandin' 'spect
When pushing comes down to a shove
So on this day
It's for you that I pray
That you will listen with you heart
And cast away the things that you have heard
So on this day
It's for you that I pray
That you will listen to my own
And hear a soul instead of just my words
Instead of just my words
Instead of just my words

All the time

We will give you what we came to give you
Where we gonna take you to another place where we can elevate your mind
All The Way
Girl I'm gonna make you hit your soul and make you feel it
Take you all the way inside
Baby
All The Way
Make you move it
Make you feel it
Put your hands up in the air
And let your troubles go away
We're gonna make you feel real good inside
