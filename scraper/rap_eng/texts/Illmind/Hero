[Sample 1:]
Is there no one else?
Is there no one else?
Who are you soldier?
Achilles, son of Peleus
Achilles?
I'll remember the name

[Verse 1: Evan]
Chryses in crisis Agamemnon seized his prize with a gleam in his eyes prayers to Apollo
Appauled God swallowed his breath and the let the arrows do the rest
In peace the Greeks seek the seer to cure the disease that brought them to their knees
Achilles pleads to return Chryseis but Agamemnon wants Briseis
Abandoned the war until Patroclus dies Achilles' eyes get wide as he cries out to the sky
Return with intent to avenge his fallen friend Hector's only plan of attack is defend
And run he has no chance against the rage of Achilles with his fists clenched
Holding his neck the menace of Achilles is so intense
Hector only wants to allay the attack now he lays on his back
Achilles killing Trojans carried the Hellenes in his knapsack
Tackle the terrors that tower before him
Reap the rewards of wars grim when the swords hit!

[Sample 2:]
Get up Prince of Troy
Get up
I won't let a stone take my glory

[Verse 2:]
He out for the plunder, he’s a hunter for Hector
His fate already chosen, power of a dozen
Achilles blood frozen, I see the fire in his eye
Hawk with power, wings wide he’s ready to die
Fly away Hector already chosen to lie
In Hades, Andromache already ready to cry
Hector brave to fight for his glory and pride
Even if it means go against   Achilles
Don’t dilly, dally, near a Greek rally
Sadly, he not sure if he is actually ready
It’s torture, his fear is a scorcher
The bestial composure, to Hector’s horror
Plunder riding right over, it’s all over
He slams his spear right near his shoulder
Hector rolls over, he lays on his back
In fact,content with the fact
That Achilles was the one to attack
The end of the swords click, clack
And the arrows, so narrow split the bone marrow
Standing tall like a scarecrow, he scares foes
The war is no more, but is Achilles really the hero?
Is he really the hero?

[Sample 3:]
Imagine a King who fights his own battles
Wouldn't that be a sight
