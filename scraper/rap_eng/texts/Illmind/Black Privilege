Verse 1 [Napoleon Da Legend]

Highly debated documented from the bottom how I made it
On a long journey got a marathoner’s dedication
Muscles sore double shot of adrenaline in my core
Feeling the hot sun beating on my melanin more
You’ll never understand my pain and what I effin’ endure
“No” is “Yes” don’t accept rejection anymore
The embodiment of strength god gave me the gift
All these jealous haters patiently waiting to see me slip
Climbed a mountain just to find another mountain to climb
They wanna muffle my voice they tried to silence my mind
But I’m here! You can’t humiliate or kill me with fear
I’m full of life that makes me rich I’m billionaire
Regardless your education your bank account and your privilege
I’m achieving more with less and that’s where the difference is
I’m focused can never take it away from me
Salute the G I’m going all in pray for me!

Chorus
Verse 2 [Mad Squablz]

Sellin me short I’m sellin my knack for dying
They say cause I’m black I’m showing my lack of triumph
Attack and conquer we have to prosper they can’t decline us
Try to desecrate as we pose a threat to ya whole environment
Strength in numbers they hate to love us we know
That’s why a lot was taken from us there’s strength in color was infiltrated
Mainly to make sure you hate ya brother giving us drugs and weapons
To help us erase each other its wicked listen
They privilege is white our privilege is death
They living the life we live in distress scrambling
Tryna find the answers to this madness the sadness
Why the hell a white man gotta to kill us for us to realize we matter
Batter and bruised I’m either mad or confused
We have to win every battle either that or we lose unbeatable
When united that’s the only way to fight it
Fists up eff the system yeah they know we the truth
