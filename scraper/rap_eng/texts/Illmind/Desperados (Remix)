[Chorus]
They know when I'm in this town
But they don't want me around
I heard they're hunting me down
Perk of being a desperado]
(Bang)
That's five of them now
(Bang)
That's ten of them now
(Bang)
Oh boy I've lost count
Perk of being a desperado

[Verse 1]
You know and I know that I'm straight up, a desperado
Grabbing at me for business but I prefer to fly solo
Say signing me guarantee's that bad luck would follow
But I don't believe em, no I don't believe em, no
I got plenty
Bars yeah I got plenty
Type up a message to send me
I don't accept then they try and forget me
They say "aw just forget em."
He wasn't worth nothin
I'll turn that nothin to somethin
Don't say there's something I can't do
I'll do it just to prove that ain't true
I have a tough soul, I'm not like you
The number of people like me is few
You all know I'm one of a kind
Trying to achieve peace of mind
I'm unique to my time
In a wrong world
Trynna do right
Losing my soul
Just trying to give life
Trying to give like it's Christmas
Then go on and get back to business
People will never get this
That with God I am the richest

[Chorus]
They know when I'm in this town
But they don't want me around
I heard they're hunting me down
Perk of being a desperado]
(Bang)
That's five of them now
(Bang)
That's ten of them now
(Bang)
Oh boy I've lost count
Perk of being a desperado

[Verse 2]
Ha! I see that they trying
But now matter how hard they try, they still can't catch me, no
I turn around look behind me (Ha!)
They giving they all but they knees deep in my dust
Dear Houston, Houston, these boys got a problem
They far off when I take off
Know I fooled 'em when they shout "we caught em!"
Pass through a town, without them even knowing
Then they realize that it was me, when they hear what was flowing
Watch me do my own thing
And see all that I bring
They ain't mad, they just jealous
But that's not what they tell us
Won't you all please, pretty please take a seat
I'm fooling with you all, escape with my magic feet
Dusting those boys, has become a regular thing
Taking flight with my pair of wings
Magic combo, I'm like Hermes
Delivering the message, out to all the people
I'm in outdoors, not just in the steeple
Now my name is desperado
And I'll be gone tomorrow
And these guys, that want my hide
They say my life is shallow
But don't worry about me
Worry about how you'll be
Those guys want the whole town
And then wanna bring it down
Don't let them get near
Unless you want a new fear
Those guys have good firepower
But they can't take what's ours
I'm up on that wanted sign
Cuz they want what's mine
How I got that is, why they all surprised

[Chorus]
They know when I'm in this town
But they don't want me around
I heard they're hunting me down
Perk of being a desperado]
(Bang)
That's five of them now
(Bang)
That's ten of them now
(Bang)
Oh boy I've lost count
Perk of being a desperado
