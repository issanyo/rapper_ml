[Verse 1]
Nothing's changed, still wanna be just like you
You used to give me advice, on how to be just like you (like you 2x)
And I'll always remember when I stole from your room
I still imitate every move you make

[Pre-Hook]
I'm done wasting my time, running 'round tryna figure it out
I could just copy your blueprint that you filled out

[Hook]
Always looking for a master plan
But you gave me the light it's shining in my hand
I could die if I knew that I could be just like you
I would lie if I said I'll never be just like you (like you)

[Verse 2]
You can even ask my sister, I tried to paint a copy of my brother's picture
And my big brother was the one that gave me wisdom
When I was just 5 who would have thought where I would end up
When I got in trouble, you know you saved my life
Even when it was my fault, you made me feel alright
I didn't know how I should talk to bitches, I was shy
And all the things you taught me, man, they made me real
Made me realize

[Pre-Hook]
I'm done wasting my time, running 'round tryna figure it out
I could just copy your blueprint that you filled out

[Hook]
Always looking for a master plan
But you gave me the light it's shining in my hand
I could die if I knew that I could be just like you
I would lie if I said I'll never be just like you (like you)

[Bridge]
I will never find another mentor like you
All my teachers, man, they let me down, they're all the same (like you)
I don't know how I'm supposed to fix it all (like you 2x)
If I said I'll never be just like you (like you)

[Hook]
Always looking for a master plan
But you gave me the light it's shining in my hand
I could die if I knew that I could be just like you
I would lie if I said I'll never be just like you
Always looking for a master plan
But you gave me the light it's shining in my hand
I could die if I knew that I could be just like you
I would lie if I said I'll never be just like you (like you)
