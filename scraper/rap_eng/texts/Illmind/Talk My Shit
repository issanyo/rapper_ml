[Verse 1: Joell Ortiz]
Barbaric, bar none I'm authentic
Car tinted, nobody can see the God in it
Broads vicious, publicly they be all timid
Behind doors I stroke different, tarred bridges

Extra extra what 'chu reading 'bout
If it ain't me then you should throw that shit you reading out
Just pulled the european out and took the scenic route
Driving 10 minutes and I still ain't even leave the house

[?] rims on the nose brim
Pockets full of cheese like the old timbs'
Bad DMs, all in my DMs
Dick game muy bien, they tryna BM

I be in this booth spitting good
So rappers stay clear but sometimes I wish a nigga would
Y-A-O, W-A they know
This shit Eazy, NWA ayo

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
Lemme talk my shit (oh, no)
Yeah nigga I'ma talk my shit (oh, no)
Aye lemme talk my shit (oh, no)
Yeah nigga I'ma talk my shit (oh, no)
Lemme talk my shi-

[Verse 2: Joell Ortiz]
Jeans sagging, g-status, G Wagon
G fabric all over the feet, G Mackin'
Gee wiz, I'm never on IG yappin'
Cause I done seen life switch when a tweet happen

I'm going for the gold rotten apple huh
Y'all doing rose gold on an Apple watch
I'm 18k gold rollie bezel apricot
Never has a tic, never has a tock

Yeah nigga lemme talk my shit
I never plead fifth, always brought my 5th
Extended the mag, look how long my clip
Saw one nigga flip, and y'all all might flip

I live this lifestyle, they be on my dick
Answer your wife's phone like "don't call my bitch!"
Hustle on mic-phones, this is all my strip
But trust me, this ain't all I rip

[Chorus: Joell Ortiz]
Lemme talk my shit (oh, no)
Yeah nigga I'ma talk my shit (oh, no)
Aye lemme talk my shit (oh, no)
Yeah nigga I'ma talk my shit (oh, no)
Lemme talk my shi-

[Outro: Joell Ortiz]
Yeah nigga I'ma talk my shit
Aye lemme talk my shit
Yeah nigga I'ma talk my shit
Lemme talk my shi-
