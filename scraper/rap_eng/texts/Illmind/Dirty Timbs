[Verse One]
No one gave me nothin', I had nothin' handed to me
If you talkin' money, then you got an understandin' with me
I can't believe I ever treated you like family homie
I let you in and now you actin' like you barely know me
Fuck 'em, I don't want 'em, I don't need 'em
I don't bite the hand that feed me ain't the reason that I'm eatin, nah
Man I did it with my mothafuckin' talent
But these corny mothafuckas want credit for my achievement, nah
Listen, are you a liar or a grown man?
Yeah, 'cause you can't be both, right?
Yeah, you ain't ridin' with me, we ridin' on you
The least that I could do is let you know, right?
I stand alone, I gotta handle it
Yeah, 'cause if you ain't gonna do it yourself, it isn't happenin'
And management said can it with that Hispanic shit
But mira mira mothafucka, es mi vida mothafucka
Ain't nobody tellin' me how to live my life
I'm comin' back like I'm Buddha, I'm 'bout to live it twice
Don't ever listen to no one, now that's the best advice
You don't gotta a clue what I sacrifice, I told ya

[Hook]
Now I don't owe nobody for a damn thang, hell nah
(Hell nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
They lyin' if they told you that you can't change, hell nah
(Hell nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
And we out here in some dirty ass Timbs
It's the mothafuckin' outfit and these bitches ain't about shit
A middle finger in the air for the people that'll doubt it

[Verse Two]
People still are askin' what happened with that Ross shit
He made some promises but he was only talkin'
He said the lawyers would call me with an offer
But what the hell type of boss answer to bosses?
I was gettin' calls on the label, I sat across at the table
From Wendy Goldstein, we talked and we played her
Couple songs from the tape that I would drop a week later
Then she stopped and said she had to put the offer on paper
But we waited and it never came
They wanted me to sell my soul so they could go and sell me dreams
These label people, they tell you things to tell you things
You gotta see through their bullshit like cellophane
I am not embellishin', I just had to speak this
I don't want them thinkin' that my silence is weakness
Imagine if I had signed and started beefin'
Would he had turn his back on me like after that Meek shit?
Man, I ain't even sleepin', I gotta get it for my family and nieces
Yeah and I probably shouldn't release it
But I ain't never listen to reason, I told ya

[Hook]
Now I don't owe nobody for a damn thang, hell nah
(Dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams)
They lyin' if they told you that you can't change, hell nah
That's why we out here in some dirty ass Timbs
It's the mothafuckin' outfit and these bitches ain't about shit
A middle finger in the air for the people that did doubt it
Now I don't owe nobody for a damn thang, hell nah
(Hell nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
They lyin' if they told you that you can't change, hell nah
(Hell nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)
And we out here in some dirty ass Timbs
It's the mothafuckin' outfit and these bitches ain't about shit
A middle finger in the air for the people that'll doubt it
Dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams
Dreams, dreams, dreams, dreams
