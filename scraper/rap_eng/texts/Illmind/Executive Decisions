[Verse 1: Anyextee]
I'm sticking needles in you rapper dolls, Yes!
The lyricist hex you fear is from Anyextee (Pronounced "Next")
Cause y'all rappers stay in the fuckin red; period sex
Period
Boardroom to the mixing board room
Whoever's mixing your tune is gonna be bored soon
Your not committed I was in the 80's rocking fitteds
Send it where? The engineer? He tried to pay me NOT to mix it
CEO Status, usually I'm not for shouting
But y'all was doubting so I dropped an album on Amalgam
Ever seen tears from a babies eye while his dad waves goodbye?
His sentence was the max b, he had to wave goodbye
And thats my G, one of the realest in these shady times
Shady Times like Marshall's rolly over Haley's eyes
Talcom soft, you not ready for war my styles been camoflouge, dummy
I been getting money since Amalgam analog
With the same hand you cats bite off
Daniel son, I'll take ya wax right off, ya tax write off

[Hook: Anyextee]
I ain't stressing
And since they wanna know the same question
I let 'em know to buy the album or remain guessing
I ain't stressing
And since they wanna know the same questions
I let 'em know; buy the album or remain guessing
Don't ask me about Max B, ask me nuffin' about Budddens
Executive Decisions, and that's why I had to cut him

[cut up vocals and scratches] "Executive Decisions, Executive Decisions"

[Verse 2: Anyextee]
While y'all was hating, I was making a lot of skrill
Signed Curren$y without defacing a dollar bill
Your rhymes worry me, I pout my face that you got a deal
I made from the bottom to the top of the Hollywood Hills
Probably could polly for real
But your too busy out chasing molly and pills
All them chemicals in your body could kill
I'm not a hippy, I just know a lot of history
Am I paranoid or do they really got a plot against me?
Ok, maybe I am the hippy type, no shit
Maybe they want the micro chips inside those wrists
Might wine and dine a serious dime, sign a lyricist
Earn some cash, burn some wax, go out and climb a pyramid
My muscles and hustle and the skills an evolution
Shot a movie about it, filmed a revolution
Passport looking like who could ask for more?
I see y'all in the building but I'm moving past the door

[Hook: Anyextee]
I ain't stressing
And since they wanna know the same question
I let 'em know to buy the album or remain guessing
I ain't stressing
And since they wanna know the same questions
I let 'em know; buy the album or remain guessing
Dont ask me about Max B, ask me nuffin' about Budddens
Executive Decisions, and that's why I had to cut him

[cut up vocals and scratches] "Executive Decisions, Executive Decisions"

[Verse 3: Anyextee]
I wrote this verse from up above with a Cloud Pen
Listen to how the nouns blend, never will the style end, Never bro
I'm on the couch with two E's and two L's like it's the Ellen Show
Most of y'all will never blow
Your like wet dynamite at a fire works show
Don't hate the work ethic though, just admire it bro
Quite your tone, I went from eating out McDonalds trash bins
To hitting the bank and putting a lot of cash in, Gotta laugh man
Autographing your CD and I'm not even a rapper
Go to Egypt and after come back teaching a pastor
I'de school you on the knowledge but you cowards learn slow
Hold up, I gotta take this call, It's the Howard Stern Show
Is it true you really started Joe Budden TV?
True, you broke the contract with Jimmy that Freed Max B?
Are you really the one who started Lil B cookin?
Buy the album if you want the answers, Good lookin

[Hook: Anyextee]
I ain't stressing
And since they wanna know the same question
I let 'em know to buy the album or remain guessing
I ain't stressing
And since they wanna know the same questions
I let 'em know; buy the album or remain guessing
Don't ask me about Max B, ask me nuffin' about Budddens
Executive Decisions, and that's why I had to cut him
