Verse 1:
If I jump would I fall? You'll consider a fail
Well then phukk what you thought meet Jenny & Taylor
Watch your mouth of these crumbs there are birds in these streets
I don't swerve with police not a word say the least
Say at least if that word of all words did increase?
And with that being said "Say Dat" phukk with me
Lay back puff a tree East coast under siege
How you fly with no buzz? Bet it sting bumble bee
On my shit but I'm on talk my shit humbly
That's that shit take a sip that's a smooth cup of tea
I ask God to just watch me streets tryna clock me
I say what I want Who on Earth finna stop me?
I'm back

Hook:
If I'm back at the moment
Then where was I going or roaming to say where I go?
Haven't gone anywhere I been here for the longest
I done lost all my mind this is left Cerebro

Verse 2:
Let it breathe take a breath
This the end of the road Are you brave? Take a step
Are you sacred? Take a step back and chill take a rest
Take a nap little rapper I'm taking the bet
You just taking up space What you say? Say you next?
Rub your chest in some shit say that shit with your chest
Are you scared? Get a dog If you brave go to war
If you mean get a heart Are you nice? Grow a ball
Who you race on a bike? I am nicer than y'all
Do as I preach Get two more? Guess Ill throw a ball
Got no time on the clock to recline and be off
When my mind is on incline Its climbing a wall
Do you have any space in a wall to go hide
Inside and stop rapping and die for a while?
I ask God to just watch me streets tryna clock me
I do what I must Who in Hell gonna stop me?
I'm back

Hook:
If I'm back at the moment
Then where was I going or roaming to say where I go?
Haven't gone anywhere I been here for the longest
I done lost all my mind this is left Cerebro
