[Intro: Mali Music]
You know I'm a wanted man
For reasons you won't understand
Prices on my head, for like a hundred grand
Cause I'm wanted dead or alive

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
(Bang, bang!)
You woulda thought I was whippin' and pushin' and sellin' this dope
(Bang, bang!)
The way that they tell me to get out of town and then aim for the throat
(Bang, bang!)
They trying to ghost your boy, they pullin' the gun out the holster
(Bang, bang!)
But I'm doin' me, I'm doin' me like I'm 'posed to, yeah!
You're smart
Out here like the Wild Wild West
Shawty right here with the wild, wild dress
They tell you can be more if you show less, hol' up
I been around the block a few times, I got a new mind, I'm lit
Man, I was sleepin' on futons, bread small as croutons
Now my business legit
How many beats do I got to poop on to prove I'm not a fluke?
I want true, a true sign a growth
For you find ways to refind yourself
You win when you lose, aye!
Seem like every team them got a Judas
But I don't care
Give me a snake and I'll make a nice pair of boots, yeah
I ain't tryna be liked, man, I'm tryna be a light, bang!
I ain't tryna make a livin', man, I'm tryna make a life, bang!
Ayo, that's way different
Nowadays I pray different
Used to ask for mo' blessings
Now I thank Him for the ones He givin'

[Hook: Mali Music]
You know I'm a wanted man
For reasons you won't understand
Price is on my head, for like 100k
Now they want me dead or alive
Bang!
They gunnin' for me now
Bang!
They got they weapons drawn
Bang!
They say get out of town
Cause I'm wanted dead or alive

[Verse 2: Andy Mineo]
How do you terrify a man that ain't scared to die?
So while I got a mic, I'ma air the lies that paralyze my people
I live by the fear of God (uh)
I'm sick and tired of songs that don't dignify a lady
But, baby we givin' them power
The moment you go out and buy it and give 'em yo' dollars
Why they try to define us by how many commas we got?
They don't know what's inside us
But let me be honest, there's somethin' beyond us
Yo, homie, preach!
I gotta speak on my peace
Man, I can't keep it a secret
The only way that you get acceptance is when you know you don't need it, yeah
Freedom is a mindset, and I ain't in my prime yet
Miner League and one sixteen, yeah
Them my folk I grind with
I think about all that time spent way before success
Get to see the kid shinin', that's the glimmer from the sweat
Get up and go
Homie, we live by the code
We don't got minutes to blow
Time is more precious than gold
Sharp with the flow
Mix it with lyrics that fix up your soul, oh
I ain't tryna be liked, I'm tryna be a light, bang!
I ain't tryna make a livin', man, I'm tryna make a life, bang!

[Bridge]
Alright, now we some desperados (we are)
Livin' by the motto (you know)
If I die tonight, man, I'm ready for tomorrow (you got)
They say get out of town (hay)
The truth won't let me lie though (what else)
They gunnin' for me now (alright)
They know the way I go (lets go)
They want me dead or alive
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm wanted dead or alive
I'm wanted

[Hook: Mali Music]
You know I'm a wanted man
For reasons you won't understand
Price is on my head, for like 100k
Now they want me dead or alive
Bang!
They gunnin' for me now
Bang!
They got they weapons drawn
Bang!
They say, "Get out of town"
Cause I'm wanted dead or alive
Bang!
