Bridge:
Keep pushing away
They working against me
Keep push away
Keep pushing away

Intro:
Whether or not,They're subtle or in your face
Someone always scheming to get you out of place
Take your moment,Block your shine
The test of real strength is to stay align

Verse 1:
As a youngin',Nothing seem out my reach
So at 9,I decide to try & spit on these beats
And with each rhyme,I thought my shit was in prime
I could rivals my idols & make 'em witness their time
I'm Unbreakable,Mindstate Bruce Willis
The illest muthafucker who spit & ever do kill it
Permitted to breaking physics & Committing who hit
Haters really 'gon mad at my next visit,You get it?
Growing up, No one gave it up a fuck
Everyone was like "Nigga,You will never be good enough
Never be rich as Puff,Never be big as Jigga
You gon stay down here,Just a broke ass nigga"
It seems these dreams bring out the worst
The ones closest to you the ones dishing the dirt
The ones that say they love you could be making you hurt
But once you at the top,watch their feelings convert

(Bridge + Hook)
Keep pushing away
They working against me
Keep push away
Keep pushing away

Tryna silence my sound
These the same niggas tryna hold me down
(Tryna hold me down) Drop a nigga in the water
Watch a nigga drown

Verse 2:
They gon' have to kill a nigga 'fore they kill my drive
Dreams of dipping out this hell is what kept me alive
I preside where bullets fly & never care where they land
Where you're selling that white or got that Glock in your hand
Understand most of these niggas never saw a way out
Without a doubt,Without a paddle down a dangerous route
Staying devout that he'll make a way
But everyday,Homie wake up to a starving baby in that section.8
Full Plate,No time for dreams,Childish things
Steady hustling to get his child his things
What the day 'gon bring,Don't pop in his mind
Cause if a nigga gets to testing then he'll pull out the nine
Define life cause that ain't what that is
Don't hate a nigga if he wanna life different the shit,You bastards
Never want to see a nigga do better
But they jumping at the chance to get you cheddar,Fucking beggars

(Bridge + Hook)
Keep pushing away
They working against me
Keep push away
Keep pushing away

Tryna silence my sound
These the same niggas tryna hold me down
(Tryna hold me down) Drop a nigga in the water
Watch a nigga drown
