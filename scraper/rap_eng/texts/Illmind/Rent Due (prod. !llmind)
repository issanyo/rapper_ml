[Hook 1]:
A nigga on my grind like the rent due
Hit the pavement to fill my pockets like the rent due
Said a nigga on my grind like the rent due
Get up out my way or catch a lyric to the temple
A nigga my grind like the rent due
(shit) like the rent due
Said a nigga on my grind like the rent due
(shit) like the rent due

[Verse 1]:
Said a nigga on my grind like the rent due
Get up out my way or catch a lyric to the temple
Judah Jabb punchline, Mayweather metaphors
Man turned beast feast
Watch a nigga animorph
Seven headed hydra spitting fire from my lyric core
Sitting next to God scribing verses you call miracles
Niggas stay ascending like an anime protagonist
Went from flipping words to flipping brains on they axis
Similes like scalpels to your scalp just for practice
Up on pins and needles turn sleeping beauties to cactus
And to all my drowsy niggas did you catch this?
Wanna nap on me? well here's a Freddy Kruegar mattress
(shit)

[Hook 2]:
Said a nigga on my grind like the rent due
Hit the pavement to fill my pockets like the rent due
Said a nigga on my grind like the rent due
Get up out my way or catch a lyric to da temple
A nigga on my grind like the rent due
(shit) like da rent due

[Kendrick Lamar Interview Snippet]

[Verse 2]:
The illest to ever do it on the east coast
Murder she wrote and the bic gotta deep stroke
Busting through the pages, graduated to the keyboard
Started with a dagger now a nigga swinging flaming swords...
But it's no Eden on my back
Jus my fucking city on the eastside of the map
Been bumping Capital Steez to raise my inspo
No Pro Era flow but my era slow-ly approaches
Crushing you cockroaches, buenos noches
Wordplay Leukemia sick
Venomous Anansi with that dark matter atom spit
Fuck around and get your atoms split
Have your anatomics on nuclear fission shit
Rap physicist
Miracle scribble archangels from different angles
Like the blade of Gabriel, soul is in danger
And that bul from da manger
Ain't gon' save you
So ain't no point in calling him
Your death here was inevitable and he's the one dat called it in
Hitman from the heavens so this murder more divine than sin
Can't fit your hands in the pockets you gon' find me in
Said that I'm too soft well nigga lets make it grimy then
Lets hear you scream it from that coffin they gon' find you in
