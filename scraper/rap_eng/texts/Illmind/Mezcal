[Hook]
For the world, for the city, for the fam’
We taking over man, the team expands
Pour a little something out for the crew
You, you, you, you
Pa' arriba, pa' abajo
Para centro, para dentro

[Verse 1]
Salud! Spill something, let the glasses bang
Standing on Earth, blessed with intergalactic range
One love, one aim, one destiny
One way or another Mother Earth’s testin’ me
Now, some say they’re tired of hearing it, tired of fearing it
That life is only here to experience
Carpe diem now, seizing the day
But one world feels like six billion people away

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Late night taco truck, K-Town Barbecue, [?]
Young soldiers mobbin’ through L.A
Known Gallery, Mid-City Arts to Crew S
Lakers runnin’ Staples Center, doin’ what they do best
Downtown drinkin’, skyline flashin’
Buildings blinking at me as they fly right past me
The best natural [?] on the planet, it’s a fact
Once a nigga, can’t believe the access to the tax
Medical cause, licensed legal dispensaries
I knew they welcome caregivers eventually
I’m coming live from the middle of the city
Capital of the world, the brochure is so pretty
My fault like the San Andreas
I shook the world from L.A
Globetrot around the world in a day, land
Pour a little something out in the sand
Celebrate the life of those that kept the world in their hand

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pourin’ mezcal until the gusano’s free
Goin’ numb trying to set me hermano free
But it seems like the beast don’t want to hear about my niece
At this point justice is time served and released
My baby brother looks different through glass
Though hourglass sand and the seconds do pass
It’s been a little too quiet for a year and a half
I love seeing him stay strong, but miss hearing him laugh
Though early morning with them others, baby mothers’ brothers’ ladies
Belly of the beast, into the guts of Hades
His wife in a daze, I’m hung over so were’ both in a haze
Feeling anxious like I’m walking on stage
Phonin’ the locker, through the line last name
First name Rakaa, crazy thoughts running through my mind
What does a [?] cost? Setting the [?] off
P.E. black steel in the black hour of chaos

[Hook]
