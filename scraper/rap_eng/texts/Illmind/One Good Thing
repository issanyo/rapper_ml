[Bridge]
One good thing about music is
When it hits you ,you feel no pain
One good thing about music is
When it hits you ,you feel no pain
So hit me with music
Hit me with music now,yeah
Hit me with music
Brutalize me with music

[Verse 1]
It was '98 when I bought my first CD
40 Oz. to Freedom and Hello Nasty
I had the ill Communication with The Slim Shady LP
This was my escape when nothing else helped me
Oh now

[Hook]
Yo flip the record, don't skip skip the record
Just play the music I really wanna check it
This is most definitely
The thing I L-O-V-E
So whenever the music fades
There'll be nothing left in the world
To remove the pain, I said
Whenever the music fades
All we should do is just remember one thing

[Bridge]
One good thing about music is
When it hits you ,you feel no pain
One good thing about music is
When it hits you ,you feel no pain
So hit me with music
Hit me with music now,yeah
Hit me with music
Brutalize me with music

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go I take my headphones with me
And build a stairway to heaven as a college drop out
Cause I was miseducated like Lauryn from the Fugees
And this was my escape when no one else helped me

[Hook]
Yo flip the record, don't skip skip the record
Just play the music I really wanna check it
This is the most definitly
The thing I L-O-V-E
So whenever the music fades
There'll be nothing left in the world
To remove the pain, I said
Whenever the music fades
All we should do is remember one thing

[Bridge]
One good thing about music is
When it hits you ,you feel no pain
One good thing about music is
When it hits you ,you feel no pain
So hit me with music
Hit me with music now,yeah
Hit me with music
Brutalize me with music

So hit me with music
Hit me with music now,yeah
Hit me with music
Brutalize me with music
So hit me with music
Hit me with music now,yeah
Hit me with music
Brutalize me with music
