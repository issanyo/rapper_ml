[Intro]
Yeah, shout out Big Juice and that champagne he's drinking
You know, yeah uh

[Verse 1]
Circle's always small, keep a certain few
Only ever us, just the perfect crew
People ask for help, "can we work with you?"
Got me on the verge of rude
If I may ask you kindly, please fuck off, I got work to do
Moving on, every day improving on
Came a long ways, they're like damn G you're stupid on
Something must be in the water, let us know what you be on
Studying my moves and they follow every groove we on
Bad idea to go bad on us
Hop off the bus and get left in a path of dust
Imagine us, if I don't help 'em, they get mad and fuss
Then they turn bitch and talk shit and start acting sus
Chips are down in my hands a flush
So I flip them off while I grab my nuts
You ain't catching us
Improper grammar, sorry, grandma, but I had to cuss
Fuck 'em, now I see why these fuckboys mad at us

[Hook]
Heard they was talking sideways
Uh, oh word that's what they say?
Uh, I would say it's sad to see you go
But I never gave a fuck about you anyway
Oh well
Lately I've been living so swell
Uh, if you ain't fucking with us, oh well
Phony homies always tryna ride the coattail
Uh, and don't I know it so well
Oh well, hahaha
Oh well, yeah

[Verse 2]
New deal's working out, it's how my money stays in shape
Always draped, in some A.P.C. or bathing ape
Life changed, on the day Tez played the tape
I reflect on the journey as I chill and hit the Vape
Now I'm here bitch, need a 'Rari not a Subaru
Only coming through the party if I get my crew in too
Twenty deep, no I.Ds, moving through, leave, there's no room for you
Every time you take the stage they boo at you
Uh, moving mean gas never losing steam
Rap game DiCaprio I should be on the movie screen
But the lab's where I'm usually seen
Pussy boys throwing sneak shots, I'm like, who you mean? Huh?
No shades of gray here, my wardrobe is jet-black
Fuckboys beware here, that's your cue to get back
Regardless of setbacks, I do what I'm best at
That's spit facts, bless tracks and fuck hoes and get stacks

[Hook]
Heard they was talking sideways
Uh, oh word that's what they say?
Uh, I would say it's sad to see you go
But I never gave a fuck about you anyway
Oh well
Lately I've been living so swell
Uh, if you ain't fucking with us, oh well
Phony homies always tryna ride the coattail
Uh, and don't I know it so well
