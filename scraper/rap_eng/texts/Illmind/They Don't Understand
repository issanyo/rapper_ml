I used my favorite snare on this one (that I made, of course). This one is chaos in the brain. Like, you have all these thoughts in your head and you wish you can interpret and translate them for people to understand you, but you can't. There's a sense of letting go. The minor chords in this kind of play that role. Definitely one of the dark joints on the EP. Again, signature siren chops at the end. Just a ton of fun to make
