[Intro]
"!llmind mix it"

[Pre-Verse]
I'm exiting with no hesitance
Better get injected with infections and choke on medicine
I'll get a spirit burner and melt your skeleton
I'm never credited, shits negative but you finna be dead from my adrenaline
I'ma turn your head like the bitch from exorcist
I'm threatening, resurrected from the dead again
I'm not even human, I'm a forgotten experiment!
I don't have no common sense nor intelligence
I only got a misbegotten head with it, it's in development

[Verse]
I need no syndicate in this shit while I'm ripping this into bits
I am spitting this intricate and be killing it infinite
My main mission magnificent
This is death of a lyricist, and I'm splitting their ligaments
Beaten brutally like a kid with an instrument
Fake insomnia, you just be drinking a stimulant
I need some time in prison and
I'm Asian so you know these bars are legitimate
I ain't a snake but best know the flow is so venomous
I'm getting sickened creating these wicked images, but bars be so unlimited
Living so limitless, I'm just straight killing it
Without stopping is how I'ma earn my certificate
I'ma cut up my enemy and show it to court witnesses
For a different murder case of mine which was more vicious and
I'm morbid, luring these bitches to the morgue and lynching em'
Swords with sticks is the method I'll be tormenting victims with
I'm sore as shit and my brain is a horror flick, I'm withering
I'm shaking the game with another mistake
Rappers be acting so brave when they put the gun to your face
But they be afraid of a blade and have a cop at their place
People thinking that London is safe
Little know fact, at night I'ma be munching your brain
You better be running away
I got no love for a bae, summer ain't great
I live among the hundreds of fakes
I promise forensics won't discover a trace
And yes I'm RizzyDizzy, the one from the cave...
