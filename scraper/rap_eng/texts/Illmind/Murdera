[Intro]
We know how that song go...
This one called, The Murdera

[Verse 1: Havoc]
Die, nigga, die...
Die, nigga...
Look into my crystal ball I see murder for y'all
First things first order a hearse for y'all
First nigga open his mouth first to fall
Watch who you talking to nigga first of all
My gang don't get along we arrogant
Take a while for you to assess what the damage is
Give a fuck POP where them cameras is
New York shit under new management
Blessing in disguise black mask and black gloves
Forecasts; grey skys, tears of a black dove
I can change your life I just need you to act up
Yeah thats karma we don't believe in no bad luck
He without sin cast the first stone
Good in any hood I blend like an earth tone
I murk microphones it's a homicide
As I watch the soul from your body rise

[Hook: Havoc]
Pop, pop, pop murder, murder, kill, kill
Do it for the money or we do it for the thrill
Hustlin' the goal till my nose run and spill
Blood on the streets I'm bout that dolla dolla bill

[Verse 2: Prodigy]
I'm out for gunshots to represent me
Do it for the principle and do this shit for free
You scared motherfucker? You stay away from me
You snitch motherfucker? You're supposed to be a G
The chickens and the rats and the snakes all click
They can't come outside no more I'm on my shit
I'm talking right now, you talking back then
Yeah its a new day wake up and get a whiff can you smell it?
That’s a bitch nigga’s flesh burning
I put pussy holes all over your back
You run from the tech squirtin'
Oh suddenly these niggas is feeling me
And all that bloodloss got em catching epiphanies
Young fly rap nigga and I BRAPP niggas
I understand why you upset I'm that nigga(ugh)
Shooting star, I'm a gun totin celeb
I wield pistoles, put em in wheelchairs
Fuck a peace treaty, they tried to O.D. on me
But now you want me to chill and call police on me
I'm outside of the law, above the system
I piss on the courtroom floor, I don't give fucks

[Hook: Havoc]
Pop, pop, pop murder, murder, kill, kill
Do it for the money or we do it for the thrill
Hustlin' the goal till my nose run and spill
Blood on the streets I'm bout that dolla dolla bill

[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Yeah, R-I-P for those try to go against we, (rest in peace)
We the M-O-B-B make you swallow all your teeth (you take that)
And fuck the police, we New York's finest
Top shelf gangster shit, yeah, we the grimiest
You send me up the river? I send you up the river Styx
Bitchy ass nigga, you bleed infamous
Come again

[Hook: Havoc]
Pop, pop, pop murder, murder, kill, kill
Do it for the money or we do it for the thrill
Hustlin' the goal till my nose run and spill
Blood on the streets I'm bout that dolla dolla bill

The murdera
The murdera
This one called; the murdera
