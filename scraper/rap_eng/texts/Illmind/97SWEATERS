[Verse 1: Jay Diem]
It’s possible I was birthed in a mental hospital
To lead the church of hip-hop say hello to your new apostle
New arrival I’m nuking rivals
Polluting cyphers
Dreaded menace I’m like the homicidal Mekhi Phifer
A pied piper a rough rider the best writer
Loney Toons rooming with his goons
The most despised Kaiser
King among men spitting crack until his lip blow
Pistol Pete on tracks for Pete’s sake he’s got a pistol
Don’t move
No shoes
Obvious he’s piss poor
Got a little cash spent it on time and crisp flows
And some Ritalin
Swallow while he riddling the little men who twiddle
Thinking they can match his pillagin’
Move up your men and I’ll break em’ down by the barrack
Burry em’ by the bayou and burn up all of their merits
Lyricists trying to line up their bars just because of Kendrick
I’ll hop on top of your track take your bucket hat and then kick it
Kick up dust in your lenses
Dust you off like forensics and finish you
Tell your manager that your career is finished
I’m Eminem and you Cannabis
Man to man with us
I’ll press you down where you stand corrupt
And damage all of your stamina
[Verse 2: Jay Diem]
Pick pocketed Pac’s rhymes out his pocket
So all these hip hop tops lips lock
Whenever I plop these winter flows I had since Kid Rock rocked a flat top
Doing rap-rock in hi tops till his strings popped
Dilapidate any mixtape like an M-80
You just an M-8 forgetting lyrics like you Wayne Brady
The kid crazy like Gnarls and Charles Barkley
Not a role model but I still lead like I’m Paul McCartney
Hardly barking like these no bite niggas you see on TV
It’d take a team of their leaders to even pee on my EP
Secrete the feces on tracks and then cruise through the city streaking
From a window seat just so all of the little kids can see me
Hollow lobotomist
Bottle swallowing arsonist
Artisan pauper who’ll put a molotov where your mama is
Hope you inside of the house while you tear and cough
Claw you in the face and sanitize it with some Smirnoff
I don’t smoke crack dumb nigga I sell it
Forget a born sinner Im a new born felon
No disrespect to J
I just feel a little rebellious to labels selling us cages
Im raising hell in a cellar
Oh it’s so unfamiliar they hate the way that Im ripping
These turn up vegetable rappers until they come up missing
The point you missing is that I’m so young and just getting better
Im burning up like I’m running on the track
