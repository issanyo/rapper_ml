[Chorus]

One upon a time on the J Block yo!
My homies had to get the dough
Once upon a time on the J Block yo!
The homies hit the liquor store
See we was kids so many loss innocence
Caught feelings, caught charges caught sentences
Good catching up but what's worth remembering ?
Letting go of yesterday even tomorrow's different

Bruce Wayne dark nights during car rides
Bumpy roads sharp rights on apartheid
Round the corner from poverty and hard times
Boys taking shots like paparazzi at bar fights
Still black lives going for cheap
Tributes with lip service make it harder to sleep
Right in the triple six, yea the mark of the beast
These crackers shooting up churches but they targeting me?
Look, I been black longer than I been my first name
Called nigga before a nigga ever learned names, a lot of schools underserved since the first grade
Now a nigga like 'fuck school' and never learned trades
Off the porch with the flocks in his flip flops
Veering left everyday a nigga pissed off
Back on the block or what I'm still a chip off
Between a hard place and rock but never pitched raw

All we wanted was a piece of mind
Right wrongs in the dark trying to see the light
Silver lining dark clouds when we see the sky
At the bottom looking up trying to see the heights
Yea, all I wanted was a piece of mind, a piece, a slice of the pie that America divides
Speak truth to the power ain't no need to hide
So my kids and they kids will never be denied, yeah

[Chorus]

Them boys in front the Dillon's with the Demi Lovato
Sending clucks to the store like get me a bottle
Got plenty bravado when the semi is auto
Like get to the point or send me the hollow
Still, in the color section no respect for the twelve
Since adolescence been neglected for real
Crooked corrupt methods been expected as well
Many deceptions exceptions I recollect for myself
Extremes, heaven or hell, or weapons and shells
Department of corrections maybe references jail
Indictments, with lack of evidence, expected to fail
Innocent, guilty, alleged, man a blessing would help
Brown paper bags or your check in the mail
Connections with the Mexicans, what's left on the scale
Death before the dishonor, all that's left is betrayal
Empathy, indifference, loyalty, we stressed in a cell
