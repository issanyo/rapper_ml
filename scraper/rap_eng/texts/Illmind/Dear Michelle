[Verse 1]
Once upon a time met this girl she was crying
I ran down the hall to go vomit in a stall
But I didn't pay her mind which hurt her more
Cuz I was gonna be curled up on the floor
Puking my guts out, gotta let my stomach shout
Stop abusing me, stop drowning me in liquor
I was done after a couple minutes she was still there
Her blank eyes stare, gazing into my soul
I looked down asked her why's the world cold
Young beautiful and restless i'd make her my wife
If I didn't see what happened 3 thousand 600 hundred seconds ago
She says she knows this is common practice
Wants a baby soo bad so she has to practice
Wants to find love, be wanted for a couple minutes
I tell her babygirl you're beautiful just quit it
She screams noo...I can't
You don't know what its like
Tryna have a conversation about life
And it ending soon cuz guys only wanna fxck right?
Just a thing, not a being with emotions
Smoke a ton of weed, alcohol is always choking em out
Sometimes I wanna shout, I tell her break down
I can see what she sees, your parents were never there
You just wanna go to school, your dad tried to rape you
Guys fxcked you to be cool you were the school whore
You don't speak your opinions
Cuz you're scared they'll get bored
I've met you before, I was just like you
Haven't been with 20 men but I think like you
Now I'm thinking to myself
I'm a scum of human being
I was drunk but I was in
Damn we ran a train
She gave us head and I was first
Now I'm stuck writing a verse
About the curse this girl lives
Brand new crib for her new born baby
She's gone missing and lately
I don't think about her, we don't talk
I still want her but if I go for it
Ima be another sucker falling for a broken heart
They say you can't save a slut
But I could save a poor soul
Looked her in the eyes and told her
I'll be here when it gets cold
I'm not in love, or lust but she shouldn't ride the bus
If you relate to this girl
I swear you're gorgeous don't let yourself slip
You know you deserve better I'll call you girls
Michelle here's my broken heart's letter

[Outro]
Can't save a slut...
