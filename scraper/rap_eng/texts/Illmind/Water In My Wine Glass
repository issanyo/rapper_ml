[Bridge: Peter Labeaud]
Yeah, they want the money
They want the money
They want the clothes
They want the
(Continuously hums)

[Chorus: Frontrunnaz]
Oh, poppa
Poppa was a rolling stone
Poppa was a rolling stone
Poppa was a rolling stone
Yeah, poppa was a rolling stone
Oh, poppa was a
[?] on the block
[?] up the block
24/7 ‘cause the hustle never stop, no
Poppa was a rolling stone
Poppa was a rolling stone

[Verse 1: Kay Anthony]
Uh, The glass half empty
This water in my wineglass
They wanna see my lose
But can't
Because i take substance
And turn it into something
They stories be about nothing
Everyone in a trap
And most of them fronting
They writing bout drugs
In they stories nobody
Truly talking ‘bout the glory
The world getting darker
Let's talk about these belligerent fathers
That starve us
‘cause they out late night on them corners
Hanging with niggas
And smoking marijuana
Niggas getting locked by the cops
And my pops
He was a rolling stone
He did nine years
And last time I seen him I was five
I haven't seen him since
Good thing I'm a prophet
Because I too would be selling white
Straight outta my pockets
Y'all niggas all liars, stop it
Lord please, God and protect me
From these fuck niggas that wanna wet me
I used to lie
Just to get these people to accept me
I rather tell the truth and watch ‘em reject me
Six months and they still tryna [?] me
They still tryna wet me
They still tryna get me
But they can't
Becuase I'm a man and I made it
From the bottom
And these niggas looking at me
Oh my god
God, Got ‘em (AH!)
And no they really can’t stop me nigga
I’ma keep on doing this shit ‘till
They stop me nigga (uh)
Oh my god, they can’t stop me nigga
Yeah, they can’t stop me

[Chorus: The Frontrunnaz]
Oh, poppa
Poppa was a rolling stone
Poppa was a rolling stone
Poppa was a rolling stone
Yeah, poppa was a rolling stone
Oh, poppa was a

[Verse 2: Peter Labeaud]
Am i gonna end up like my father
And leave my baby boy on that door step
Before he sprouts
Leaving his mother to wilt with no will
How could you be that wicked
These feeling been feeling
Like they were destined to reach you
I know my destiny ain't to clear
But i know ones things for certain
The apple won't ever
Fall to far from the apple tree
Been watching time repeat itself
Feel like I will never be free
Locks and chain
They lock the chains
Now we wearing chains
And wanting change
Killing ourselves
& bullets tumbling now
As I tumble down
They tearing down
Everything that we built
Why you fake creativity, toast to longevity
Fuckery, what the fuck is shit
I hate all of this radio shit
Where is the greatness and shit
The the legends and shit
No leverage in it
Most of you niggas
Is doing your shit
But most of you
Know you ain't shit
Take this pencil and pad
And don't come back
‘till something dope hit you
And you can take this
Microphone home with you
This 8 Mile
You can hate now
And it was up to a nigga
Who cared about the game
Then they'd play
Kendrick, Cole, soul 05 ye, em
Snoop, Mary, with some old Jay
Pac and Biggie
Luaryn Hill, some wale, Lil Wayne
And maybe even Drizzy Drake on the basis
And so on and so on
But hey it's a business right
And you need to make some ends right
And if I don't talk about
Fucking bitches, getting high, popping pills
And spending millions on bullshit
Then I won't get to spin huh
Well I ain't tripping then
Ima keep it real with the world
If you ain't trying to create more for the people then fuck you, die slow
I don't got no time to waste on you
I know you just hustling
But you could have put some passion and purpose up in it
Before expecting the dollars to come in
How senseless
Nigga then slept on the ones that they been dreaming bout
Where are those wack niggas you been speaking so fucking highly about?
How many of the legends let u niggas down and you still buying they shit?
Shit, should I drop names
In hopes that they gon step they shit up
And drop another classic album
And it's funny
While the niggas who was preaching the truth and could potentially set you free from being a slave in your head
A human being being used as less than human
Thats senseless
How you slept on the truth
The one that god chose to deliver the message
In a bottle


[Chorus: The FrontRunnaz]
Oh, poppa
Poppa was a rolling stone
Poppa was a rolling stone
Poppa was a rolling stone
Yeah, poppa was a rolling stone
Oh, poppa was a
