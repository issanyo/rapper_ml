[Hook: Your Old Droog]
Let's parlay
Just came home from work, you know I had a hard day
There's a time for work, and there's a time to play
Then there's another time: to parlay
Let's parlay, ay, let's parlay
Just coming home from work, I know you had a hard day
There's a time for work, and there's a time to play
Then there's another time: to parlay

[Verse 1: Your Old Droog]
All that dressing up mess is obnoxious
Sometimes I just wanna chill in my boxers
Roam the crib in a white tee
I'm grown and all that going out shit don't excite me
Rather watch a game or some Netflix
Plus I never had to hit the club to get chicks
I could meet 'em on the street, on the train
Spit a couple slick words and [?] they brain
[?] far from a scrub
That's why you hardly see me in a bar or a pub (I'm too fresh)
Picture Droog spending racks in some corn club
Rather go to XVideos or PornHub
And those whack events where I show face is a dub
Stayed home and [?]
No more [?]
Got somebody's wife hitting up my [?] tryna parlay

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Your Old Droog]
I see you shorty - looking good enough to eat up
Been on the move all day, kick your feet up
Wearing no bra, whether D-cup or A-cup
I know how early you wake up
Work hard all year round
Tonight's time to relax, let your hair down
Lotta things are on your mind, you should save it though
Kick back on the couch, watch your favorite show
Read a book, chill, have a home-cooked meal
I know in that kitchen you be slaughterin'
Or you could order in
Pick a spot to eat
I'll come through, I ain't even gotta beat
Do this a aapella
Only the truth is what I could tell her
[?] all day
But I don't even wanna smash, baby girl, I'm tryna parlay

[Hook]
