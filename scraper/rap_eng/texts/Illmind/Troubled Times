[Verse 1: Torae]
Uh, what cha wanna do
Wanna be ballers, shot callers
I’m talking ‘bout all us could get it, all us could live it
All us that send it, all us could win it
But somehow we all in divide and conquer
Disturbed the foundation, destroyed the roster
Created a monster for the fame
And money, power, respect, and nothing was the same
But nothing you could gain is worth the disdain
They put it on the airwaves, put it in your brain
Put it back to slave mentality, faked the reality
All that formality make for a casualty
Make sure you candidly fiend
Gave us AIDS first, now Ebola is the thing
And took it out the crack pipe, put it on the screen
Took it out the dope house, put it on the scene
Paint how I mean

[Hook: Mac Wilds]
Troubled times for troubled mines seem to go on and on and on and on
I’ll find a way, but there ain’t no stopping you when you’re born into the game
Game, game
When you’re born into the game
(Troubled times combined within my troubled mind)
Troubled times combined)
Born into the game
Game, game
When you’re born into the game
The game, yeah
(On and on and on and…)

[Verse 2: Torae]
Four times out of the week, she in the nightclub
For all stars and fights, she book a flight for it
According to her IG, she live the life on it
Looking for love while the lights pour in
Troubled times we’re in, she never knew who her daddy was
But scream “Daddy it’s yours” back at the caddy truck
At age 15, the 14 passes
She bug you to book the W before you smash
She ‘bout cash and clothes, hit the flash and pose
That’s Welven the Great date, who ain’t got no hoes
She look at thots as those who ain’t shit
As long as she getting money, she feel she that bitch
As long as the kid ain’t bummy, she thinking that’s it
But never realizing the trap she trapped in
Her baby girl turning 15 in a couple of days
Now I just seen her in the Escalade
What my brother Mac saying

[Verse 3: Torae]
It’s like Bishop and Steel back in the arcade
We was side by side until the law came
It was all a game in the before stage
Used to be ride or die, then it all changed
Fork in the road, you went left
I thought I’d see Def Jam before you see death
I’m learning breath control, you’re on your last breath
Them throwback Thursdays is all I have left
But ain’t enough words in the hashtag, we used to crash pads
And crack jokes and pranks, who get the last laugh
And now I see your face in every flashback
Wish I can take it all back
The time pass don’t reverse pain, penning this first pain
I swear the shit the worst, mane
I can feel you smiling down on me when I’m murking the stage
I got an angel I know by first name
Listen to Mac saying

[Hook]
