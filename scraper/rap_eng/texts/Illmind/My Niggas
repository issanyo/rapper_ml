[Verse 1]
I ain't tryna shit on y'all niggas
I don't want y'all to feel a way
I'm just livin', my niggas
Tryna make today a better day
How can you not feel that, my nigga?
I grew up in the 'jects around killers
MAC-11s, TECs and 9 millis
Welfare checks and wild dealers
I'm just happy I made it out the slums, my nigga
We scrambled over crumbs, my nigga
Tried to get fly, to avoid bein' bums, my nigga
It's rough where I'm from, my nigga
Back block fakin', crack pot shakin'
Welcome to the hood, my niggas
It's never all good, my niggas
They thought I'd be in jail
They thought that I'd get high
They thought that I would die, my niggas
I looked inside my grandmother's eyes
Promised her I would try, my niggas

[Hook]
Y'all hatin', I'm like, "Why, my niggas?"
I was like you, barely gettin' by, my niggas
Barely gettin' by, my niggas
Ridin' in the hoop, doin' like 5, my niggas
Tryna duck the 5, my niggas

[Verse 2]
Out there on the grind, take a 9 for a dime
Just tryna get mine, my nigga
Lookin' back, I was out my mind
How the fuck did I find time to try to write rhymes, my nigga?
Crab niggas tryna pull you down
Know how hard it is to climb, my nigga?
Let a nigga shine, my nigga
I'm finna cop the coupe and I'm rippin' off the roof
Whenever the sun shine, my nigga
My nigga, we talkin' 'bout me
Before the record deals, dealin', tryin' not to get a record
Boy we got it crackin' on that hill
Niggas cracked but I ain't squeal
I've always been real, for the record
Damn right I made it, you niggas gon' take it how you take it
But no if/ands, all the bitches are butt naked
You sittin' there hatin'
I'm standin' here shakin' the dice, we out Vegas

[Hook]
You mad, I'm like, "Why, my niggas?"
I was like you, barely gettin' by, my niggas
Barely gettin' by, my niggas
Ridin' in the hoop, doin' like 5, my niggas
Tryna duck the 5, my niggas
New niggas try to give me dap, but I just duck the 5, my niggas

[Verse 3]
When I was just startin', they was just watchin'
Friendship, I can't justify, my niggas
It's just us, yup, just me and my niggas
Cups up, fucked up, we some wild niggas
Y'all niggas is lame, it's a shame
You change the way you look at things
The things you look at'll start to change

[Hook]
You blamin' me? Why, my niggas?
You mad, I'm like, "Why, my niggas?"
I was like you, barely gettin' by, my niggas
Barely gettin' by, my niggas
Ridin' in the hoop, doin' like 5, my niggas
Tryna duck the 5, my niggas
Tryna duck the 5, duck niggas
