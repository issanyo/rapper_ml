[Intro: Illmaculate]
Yeah this is that warning shot; your last warning!
I can't be held accountable for my own actions...

[Hook: J-Rome]
Momma always said to me
To don't let people get to me cause it probably be the death of me
So I advice you not to mess with me
Cause ain't no second guessing when my ego get the best of me
Last call, homeboy, don't make me show ya
What can happen when my ego take over
Careful that you don't upset me
Fall back, know my pride won't let me

[Verse 1: Illmaculate]
I ain't never had to front when I mention what I did
I ain't never been a punk and I'll never be a bitch
Get jealous if you want, I'ma tell it like it is
That's my downfall, my homie homie...
It goes music, drugs, women
Add money, subtract friends like fuck 'em
I ain't cool enough with 'em
I mean it... they all fake and I know it
They all enemies in a [...] clothing
And I see 'em... and that's why I'll never be around y'all
Now jealousy will never be my downfall
Cut the dead weight that I can't afford to bear
They think I'm paranoid, I think I'm more aware

[Hook: Illmaculate and J-Rome]
Before I swallow my pride I let my heat blow
I feel it building inside, I'm 'bout to e-xplode
Put my feelings aside, no more ego
That's my downfall, my homie, downfall...
Momma always said to me
To don't let people get to me cause it probably be the death of me
So I advice you not to mess with me
Cause ain't no second guessing when my ego get the best of me
Last call, homeboy, don't make me show ya
What can happen when my ego take over
Careful that you don't upset me
Fall back, know my pride won't let me

[Verse 2: OnlyOne]
Don't trip, I'm with the People, you know the set
Cause when you have a dream then it's over heads
So I'ma sleep when I'm old and dead
So I don't see a thing but my own success
Police got a quarter with your face
Ride with me, I got about a quarter in the tank
Yeah, mixing soda with my drank
This my pay, all out and throw it in the bank
More money, more sheriffs, more feds
Snitch on us; your parents both dead!
You must have air in your head
Wake up with a horse head there in your bed

[Hook]

[Illmaculate]
I ain't never had to front when I mention what I did
I ain't never been a punk and I'll never be a bitch
Get jealous if you want, I'ma tell it like it is
That's my downfall, my homie homie...

[Bridge: J-Rome]
I ain't really trying to play with y'all
Just so y'all know that
If you want it I can make a call
My goons gon' go mad
You ain't gotta be hard, you ain't gotta be a G
It ain't never been a secret
If you want it with my fam, if you speaking on my team
I'll leave somebody leaking

[Hook]
