Ain't nobody really f ing the road dawg
When you riding with me better take the top off
Let it be a drop top
These ladies see me walk now they jaw drop
Oh my gosh it's the stunner now the clock stopped
I'm bout to take it to the head
I'm finna push it to the ledge
I'm in the kitchen cooking music that my medicine
I mean I let it go, when I jump in a song I go all in
Word to the ladies if you want me (better show me what that neck do)
But I grew up on that golden eye mentality
You f ing with my money you getting dropped
Double oh 7 you mess around with The mafia you get the drop
Back to back my name stunner got the spirit of pac
Got a spiritual past
Ridicule all my plans
Don't come to me like that homie you ain't never been my mans
We just got the album of the year - hands down

I see you questioning my rap skills homie I'm a master
Cliff Stunner on the mic Imma make it a disaster
You had a good run but to talk to me you better have stats yeah, you really need to match dat

I've Been through a lot in these last months
Low and high relationships
Most of my friends becoming enemies
Been losing my mind just thinking
Like really
Where the f the love go
I mean I show a lotta love though
Why you people really, gotta do me like that though
At times I wanna go off on you on people! but Leqx be the bro he won't let me
He a real one
He know that I don't really need any, of you people but he still telling me to make room for forgiveness
Them people negative energy
Time to remove all the heads of the snakes and these leaches


And fuck all you snitches
Them boys bitches
Burry you in ditches
...GlitchesÂ 

I got more bars than a jail aye
Please pay homage like bail aye
Look at me now aye
RIP xxx aye

Amma motherfucking killer
The villain you see in marvel movies
Lemme channel my inner hulk
And fulk up this beat
I mean fuck up this beat
Me and voice of the streets
Serve beef with a diss
Side salad with dis

Dis a feast of the beasts
In Versace I hiss
Am sick sick sick
Niggas think am luminati like 666
And i preach in a Jesus piece
Am the star of the east
I don't have a broken moral compass
Everything i do with purpose

Even if maybe i pee on your carcus

Rocking Versace like Gucci
Am killing fashion with uzi
Walking like damm whos he ?
Am like oh thanks who me ?

Ghost tape might be dropping soon 40 tracks on it
44 more if i pass it to Stunner,The 1NE with the gun huh
AK 47
24/7 am working on the project like mad scientist
Hahaha
Disect your favorite rapper like a frog
Pin him on the wall next to the rats and the snitches
