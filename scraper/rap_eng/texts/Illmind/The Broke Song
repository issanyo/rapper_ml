[Verse One: Myth]
Not a dime to my name, what's the price for fame?
Cats thinkin' I'm rich, got me standin' in the rain
Wishin' I had change
In my pocket when I'm rockin'
A broke MC with bad credit
And I'm still droppin' albums like I'm so hot but I'm not
A broke cat with a tore back ride
I'm from the old school and momma told me to throw back pride
Be humble in life
It's gon' be a struggle in life
Keep yo' mind right

[Symbolyc One]
I'm 'bout to give it up, give it up
See a nickle on the ground, pick it up, pick it up
The Broke Song, I'd rather be singin' The Hope Song
I never the less stress keepin' my throat strong
Money I tote wrong
Hopin' the rope's long enough
S-1, the brother with the oak tongue
No need to prolong
Stuck, got a brand new truck
Hopin' the note's gone
Come along to the song

[Scratch Hook]
"Throw back ride"
"Give it up, give it up"
"Keep ya mind right"
"Gotta work a 9 to 5"
"Don't struggle, just hustle"
"Wishin' I had change"
"What's the price for fame"
"I'm still broke"
"Cause the way we livin' now is wack"

[Verse Two: Myone]
Let's hustle like we bubblin' crack
Find a way to educate and elevate and sell this shit right back
To the powers that be
Because I know they ain't empowering me
And that didn't take me two towers to see
Know
That the world is slowly dying every day
We livin' so broke, check to check
Minimum waging ain't enough, below income stuff
Yeah I could serve kill but it's hard to pay the bill when in cuffs
So let's, flip the 5-0 until it's 0-5
Till we dictate the cost to survive
I hustle dead or alive
With the U.S. debt on the line
I wanna climb till I'm dead or resign
All I'm hearing is
"Your check bounce", a gram short of an ounce
And it's hard to pay the rent with nothin' but common sense
And since we've been dealin' with the power of the yen
We made a vow to keep hustling here until we rise up

[Scratch Hook]

[Verse Three: Myth]
My man skill on the beat
Yo I need something to eat
This hunger makes me wonder why I'm praying my soul to sleep
Threw the 20's on the Jeep
God makin' them ends meet
But I gotta produce more heat if them 20's I want to keep
So
I'd rather watch my seeds grow
Cause they foul you to shoot, call it a free throw
Knowin' a brother need doe
Blow
I'm 'bout to put the horns down
The Heavenly Father stricken me when I'm weak and when I'm torn down

[Symbolyc One]
Yo I'm stressed from the job that's got my head twisted
Livin' like I got money, I'm ballin'
Not even close y'allin'
Maxed out credit cards with a bottle full of [?]
Semi po' folks that ain't no joke
Tryin' to get my seeds some of them beautiful things
A pool in the back with a set of swings
A lot of dreams, sometimes I gotta scream
Plot and scheme ways of makin' them collared greens
Droppin' the hottest heat, rockin' the beats
