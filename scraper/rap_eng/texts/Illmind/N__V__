[Verse 1]
Dancing by my windowsill
I want you, you always drift away
I can feel you disappear
Warm me up, but you don't ever stay
Little piece of heaven, sleep and rub my neck
And go in circles round my eyes, I get hypnotized
You could be so reckless
Give me just a second of the sweetest lullaby
And drift into the sky

[Chorus]
I need you some more
All the heat from before
It's too cold on the floor
Melt away all my worries
I need, at least, the ghost of you
Again, again

[Verse 2]
Dancing by my windowsill
Float around in faded lingerie
Love the way you're never still
Oh the way you move, it paints the day
Little piece of heaven, leaving is your weapon
Feels so good I want to cry, vanish right before my eyes
In love with your presence
Tangled in my breath until the moment you decide
You still love the sky

[Chorus]
I need you some more
All the heat from before
It's too cold on the floor
Melt away all my worries
I need, at least, the ghost of you
Again, again

[Verse 3]
I can't feel my limbs
I can't feel my limbs
You sweet as jelly, you sweet as jelly
You look like a jellyfish
You sting like a jellyfish
You look like a jellyfish
You sting

[Bridge]
Baby, baby, baby
Why you keep on fading?
Baby, baby, baby
You should keep on dancing
Baby, baby, baby
Why you keep on fading
Baby, baby
You should keep on dancing

[Chorus]
Oh I need you some more
All the heat from before
It's too cold on the floor
Melt away all my worries
I need, at least, the ghost of you
Again, again

[Outro]
Dancing by my windowsill
I want you, you always drift away
