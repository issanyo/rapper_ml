[Hook]
You know that cash loud, you know that weed loud
Bad bitches throw it back until they scream loud
And everything that I been putting on my feet loud
And everybody on the motherfucking team loud
If you a hating ass bitch, it’s quiet for you
If you a broke motherfucker, it’s quiet for you
If you ain’t fucking with my team, then it’s quiet for you
You fuck around and we could start a fucking riot on you

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
They say I’m young, fly and impressive
Them bad hoes get aggressive, I just take ‘em home and undress ‘em
They telling me all they secrets like that pillow talk a confession
I bring ‘em down to they knees like they praying
And then I bless ‘em, amen, I went to school with y’all
I never finished class so everything I learned, I learned from falling on my ass
Them bitches sending me pictures, just so they back
If a picture worth a thousand words, then why am I saying damn?
I’m the man, they grabbing me to start families
I ain’t tryna build with no broke cats, this ain’t habitat for humanity
Now I don’t wait for my money, my money wait for me
And there ain’t nothing you could say to me

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
They know that E block is that tree spot
And they pump in there, it’s like Reeboks
They throw duffle bags in them Nissans
In that weed spot with that heavy weight
We box or we entertain ‘cause ain’t no spics in the NBA
And they don’t show spics with no MBA
I’m on the coast of Venezuela with a ten
And all she do is tan and roll with me in bed
Nobody starting with us ‘cause they knowing we the best
And you got have a little heart in you to be a threat
I run with a clique of some troublesome spics
My people are making they money off bricks
And showing no love if it doesn’t exist
No wonder I only been fucking with chips
I don’t wait for my money, my money wait for me
And there ain’t nothing you could say to me

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Emilio Rojas]
Nah, they know I still ain’t hitting my prime
I did the tracks with them other cats but ain’t one I didn’t outshine
My city with me, they riding with me like they was sitting outside
Pretty women, they eyes is chinky, yeah everybody is high uh
My wallet staying full, there ain’t no vacancy
Hate on me, I make you take a seat like I’mma maitre d'
And every day the team been going out on them flights
But when I’m touching down, I’m going right back to them Heights
There ain’t no yes men on my team, my people say what they mean
‘Cause you can’t trust a cat that don’t say no just so everybody is pleased
Nah, now I don’t wait for my money, my money wait for me
And there ain’t nothing you could say to me

[Hook]
