[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
It's yours, the likes of which that you had never seen
Do it how you knew it, the influence never leaves
Your inhibition is kicking while they shooting up a scene
Come and do it to your pocket while they do it to their sleeve
Said to do what you believe, well we believe in more amounts
More around, more to find, more top cop, more to count
On it now, borderline mortified, stalling out
Take a leap of faith and lead the way into a smaller town
Town business like you found business when you brought it down
Borderline til a 745's brought around
And you 'round it forever whether you know it or stay away
You mount up together knowing you throwing a stray away
Thrown in a position to be lifted from a day away
Drumming like your heart beat, numb to what the song be
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

[Hook]
Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that?
Point out what you want and it's yours
Cause you gonn ask Bodie for a package, believe that
And everything will be the way it should be on the feedback
Hands up over fists' when it's clicking, you see that?
Point out what you want and it's yours

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
It's yours, the likes of which that you already knew 'bout
Decisiveness is everything in shoot outs
The ills of the wills when the chill don't exist
And the risks become more than the rewards that they threw out
Paint the town mint green, the intrigue stays at the front
Same story illustrated from the jump, you know the wagers that they want
But retro's is a weekly occurrence
And I'm in mine now so my deterrence, is flourished
In irony, like either make a poem or make a zone
Become a flight and do what you wish you could do and make it home
'til they teach you bout a throne and the leather that the seat on
Is from the same couch you got your feet on
Shit is more or less until the rest become a seance, you see on?
Grew up idolizing like "if Jay on, then we on"
Thrown in a position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed you denied, doe or die

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Skarr Akbar]
It's yours, the product of the environment you've confided in
Pressure bends knees like the side effects of klonopins
You deep inside the sea of the streets, look for leviathans
The beast pray on the weak, no repeats and no try agains
Silence, talk less and do more
No time to ask "who is it?" when knockers knock at your door
Put yourself in a position to listen
Or be a victim
Or another bad static of a tale in Baltimore
When summer falls, we spring into the winter
Recruit 'em at front and center
Move product with new beginners
So the package that we lend ya
Out of respect for ya father
Jell it all and have the money by tomorrow
Just do it how they taught ya
And everything will work if you believe that
Be careful, and watch for the feedback, you see that?
Thrown in the position to be with it if you want piece
Whether you agreed or denied
Doe or die
