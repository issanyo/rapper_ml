[Verse 1: Jordan Fisher]
I see what's happening here
You're face-to-face with greatness and it's strange
You don't even know how you feel, it's adorable
It's nice to see that humans never change

[Pre-Chorus: Jordan Fisher]
Open your eyes, let's begin
Yes it's really me, breathe it in
I know it's a lot, the hair, the bod
When you're staring at a demigod

[Chorus: Jordan Fisher & Lin-Manuel Miranda]
So what can I say except "You're welcome"
For the tide, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcome
I'm just an ordinary demi-guy
So what can I say except "You're welcome"
For the tide, the sun, the sky
Hey, it's okay, it's okay, you're welcomeI'm just an ordinary demi-guy

[Rap: Lin-Manuel Miranda]
Honestly, I can go on and on
I could explain every natural phenomenon
The tide, the grass, the ground
Oh, that was me, I was messing around
I killed a snake, I buried its guts
Sprouted a tree, now we've got coconuts
What's the lesson? What is the takeaway?
Don't mess with Maui when he's on the breakaway
And the tapestry here in my skin
Is a map of the victories I win
Look where I've been I make everything happen
Look at that mean mini Maui just tikkity tappin'
Singing and scratchin'
Flipping and snappin'
People are clappin', hearing me rap and
Bring the chorus back in

[Chorus: Jordan Fisher]
Well anyway, let me say you're welcome
For the wonderful world you know
Hey, it's okay, it's okay you're welcome
Well, come to think of it, I gotta go
Hey, it's your day to say you're welcome
'Cause I'm gonna need that boat
I'm sailing away, away, you're welcome
'Cause Maui's the ultimate god woah

[Outro: Jordan Fisher]
You're welcome, you're welcome
