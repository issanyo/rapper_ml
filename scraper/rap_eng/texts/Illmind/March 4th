Pedicure from the pavement
10 toes down
General labour...

[Verse 1]
Working 10 hour shifts 5 days, weekends spent getting extra dollars
Shopping resumes, waiting for responses
Been waiting too long, time to get all up in their faces
Take initiative, till they can't refuse the offer I'm making

Attention on Gerontology, and getting on beats
While prepping for the economic apocalypse, too much dishonesty
Vault keepers only talk that walk so I keep marching
Cause freedom should be the default, instead of people defaulting

My partners tell me I either ought to enjoy life or be cautious
But that's exactly what I'm doing if you see past the fraudulence
At the end of the day I'm really conscious
Just because my perspective isn't popular, doesn't mean it's nonsense

Nah man
I'm just offering an alternative
Consider how wise Will Allen is, 1 million pounds of food on 3 acres,
Iceland prospered when it took interest in a no interest populace

Aquaponics, alternative energy, atmospheric water generators, get generous in the 21st century
The age of Aquarius may be upon us
And if not then then mass extinction and poverty should be symbolic, our calling...


[Chorus]
So I keep marching
Cause even if I didn't speak on it, I'd still be the target
Freedom keeps calling
So we speak often, trying to reach nirvana as I keep marching (x2)


[Verse 2]
Deficit spending's never ending, currency based on debt leads to inflation itself
Savings worth less, isn't that something selfish?
I'll be the one to tell it
While they get credit for material embellishments, I'm out here getting money, get it?

Tapping networks 'till we tap-out but I'm just tapping my toes
According to the naked eye, the emperor has no clothes
The so-called social contract is broken, null and void
Avoid the truth because its nothing nice
Mind blowing like getting your skull destroyed

Ring the alarm like Beyonc√©
Not sure if my pronunciation wasn't a teeny bit off
The best way to control people is make them believe they have no power
Money's supposedly time, so life is per hour, but still we never die

Saving the world is ultimately saving yourself
We're committing suicide by being afraid to rebel
No need to be brave, sorry to say it
But if you're not on a watch-list being surveilled you should be ashamed of yourself

Practically impossible not to let the eye see you
Planet's getting battered by carcinogens
Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ourselves out of the ICU
For those providing courage in the struggle,  'nuff respect, I see you

Tell me to reconsider my assumptions, I'll politely discuss it
Get Jigga-like, "Risking my life I'm already dying, so fuck it"
The system will poison your plate and planet while attempting to intimidate you by threatening it won't kill you if you dont mention it

With no savings, saving those responsible for enslavement  and killing
Kill the messenger, while heroes get framed as villains
Pain inflicted due to useless waste
Orwell said, "If you want to imagine the future, picture a boot stomping on a human face, forever"


[Chorus]
So I keep marching
Cause even if I didn't speak on it, I'd still be the target
Freedom keeps calling
So we speak often, trying to reach nirvana as I keep marching (x2)
