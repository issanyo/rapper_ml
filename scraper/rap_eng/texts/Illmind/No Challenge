[Chorus]
Saint Laurent shoes keep me balanced, Mary Jane, she stain my pallets
All you rappers versus me, ain't even worthy, bruh, no challenge
We the best like DJ Khaled, fuck your wifey, spoil your marriage
Said you never made her squirt and now she feel a lil' embarrassed

[Verse 1]
No director, cut the actin', only Cs up in my faction
Split them D's out like some fractions, my team always eat, no fastin'
Losing my mind, think I'm losing my patience, this shit be deeper than just entertainment
My nigga say trappin' the only thing payin', won't be a slave to a rich corporation
I need a blunt in rotation, I be blessin' the world, I'm the savior
Every time I get out, I create shit, it come straight from the heart to the paper
I'm just spreadin' the wealth in the stealth, when you stuck, my nigga, put a quit to the hatred
I'm just spreading the wealth in the stealth, when you stuck, my nigga, put a quit to the hatred

[Chorus]
Saint Laurent shoes keep me balanced, Mary Jane, she stain my pallets
All you rappers versus me ain't even worthy, bruh, no challenge
We the best like DJ Khaled, fuck your wifey, spoil your marriage
Said you never made her squirt and now she feel a lil' embarrassed

[Verse 2]
Overheated, flow like lava, mix the greens, I'm smokin' guaca
Sippin' tea, but this ain't Java, this that one night trip in Hogwarts
You got one-night, bitch just swallow, save her name as Misses Gobbles
Catchin' planes, don't hit them potholes, every show, I hit the lotto
Hop in the coup with the stash
Don't got a license to drive, I just pull up to dealer with cash
Smokin' bisquette, my vision is cloudy, but still I won't give you a drag
No 'lluminati, but gold in my body like I'm in the band with the brass
Collectin' them bands like a pass
Hit that bitch hard like a bass, none of ya'll matchin' my pace
Can't see me like he was Ma$e, nigga just copy and paste
Throw that shit right in the waste, eat 'em up, I got a cannibal taste
Throw that shit right in the waste, eat 'em up, I got a cannibal taste
Golden soul, can't help but glow up, next three years, I'm votin' Oprah
But until then, never sober so much weed, I'm like a grower
Throw my Gs up, movin' global, if you know, then you supposed to
Don't got time to code them vocals, just don't let my thirds approach you

[Chorus]
Saint Laurent shoes keep me balanced, Mary Jane, she stain my pallets
All you rappers versus me ain't even worthy, bruh, no challenge
We the best like DJ Khaled, fuck your wifey, spoil your marriage
Said you never made her squirt and now she feel a lil' embarrassed
