[Verse 1: Skyzoo]
Walk of shame out this Gansevoort
Pockets full, but you laying there, I can't afford
But I'll be good baby, maybe this is hand in arm
And we was just getting our handle on, wonderful night
Shit I never seen, shit that you never felt
Wanting to never leave, twisting whatever's dealt
Talking to let it be, listening when you melt
Still on my G, baby, let it tell
Tell you what you love and picturing me to mean it
Told me "give that up Sky, I want it and I need it"
And you ain't have a prob showing me the way you keep it
Like this will go beyond where we are, fuck a reason
And I can love or leave it, but I ain't leaving none of this to part with
So I'll just play the part for the bargain
You put it where your heart is, baby I ain't mean it
Its not that I ain't want to, its just that I ain't see it
Just call it Drew & Derwin

[Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
We made the night
We made it a wonderful night
I didn't wanna fall in love
I thought that one time was enough
But tonight, if we do it all again
I hope we don't fall in love
Let's just make tonight
Another wonderful night

[Verse 2: Skyzoo]
Two finger hooking your murder heels
Memories double timing, look like you're hurt for real
We never pictured last night becoming today
We both wanted us, shit we one in the same
Carrying on like I'm with it all
Laying underneath you and treating you like this is yours
Word to the Mags and the bottles of Cavit that's by the dresser
I build walls after I compress 'em
I'm told that I turn cold, giving them hard dick and
Straight to the hole like Kemba Walker it was taking its toll
And feeling awkward is the way I suppose that this supposedly goes
Cuz on the low I'm supposed to be home
And you'll prolly meet a dude who's due up to find a role
And after like a month, dude will prolly propose
And I'll applaud it, and all that it's coming with
I'm nowhere near that, I usually run from it, just call it Drew and Derwin

[Hook]

[Bridge: Raheem DeVaughn]
Hope we don't, hope we don't
Fall in love, fall in love

[Verse 3: Skyzoo]
And it was nice while it lasted, right?
I gave you mic, you gave me adlibs, right
It wasn't right but that was past tense
I guess that I wouldn't be mad if
You was to move on and pretend I never happened
You giving me all, just pretend that never mattered
You gripping the walls, and getting on your ladder
Let's call it time lost, let's put that all in back of us
And leave that over there
