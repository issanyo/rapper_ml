[Verse 1 – Dutchmassive]
I sway once in and out the track
Wanna stay collapsed with my headphones attached
Pshhh… Really not concerned about stats
Point is to reach you, not for feedback
Numbers ain’t important—we don’t need these plaques
And that hotness you yell about is straight disease rap
If you hear between the lines, you can tell the freeze back
Cool like that… I’m cool like that…
Cooler than a polar bear (Dude, not that...)
I don’t play—I stick on my grind all day
And lay a foundation for our kids these days
Many stray away from the truth.  They say
“May our words be forgotten.”  And that’s not okay
Let’s redirect, focus, and reform our aim
When we know they hang on every word we say
I’m making music for a brighter day

[Hook]
I fell asleep with this beat on repeat
We better than you, life seems to [creep?] me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me

[Verse 2 – Median]
An Illmind had to provide this here
Had to be the rhythm that’s inside to spit
Median’s the violence that’s prescribed by the kid
Plus, the Dutch and the rhythm—when they got it, I’m here
I’m obliged by the rhyme that I build
Next, surf the network and it’s time to bill
Known for the prose, so the job then appears
And I do what I like.  Yo, do what I feel
The truly cool presumed a movement was in here
They can feel the music move the ruler up the hips
The jeweler of the newness influenced by the iddish
Congruent to the you and I, the brewer of the fix
Yo, yo, gotta bring it back in this here
The jeweler of the newness who’s influenced by the iddish
Walking over this here is kind of like a bridge
It’s magnificent.  Kind of like a biz’

[Hook]
I fell asleep with this beat on repeat
We better than you, life seems to [creep?] me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me

[Verse 3 – Von Pea]
You want it?  I got it.  Floating like water
Rouse up and swim and cut past borders
Some are down the drain, no matter the build up
I don’t let it clog my path.  Peep, I’m still up
Cold, solid, I’m Cube in his heyday
Friday’s all week, so we avoid melee
Rappers hate, they get gassed, evaporate
Claiming original, they ain’t even a candidate
Seventy percent of you is me
I do believe you pay less to choose a Pea
My reign S-O-N, ease
And I don’t mean Illminds, homie
I mean it’s so lonely
Sittin’ in a cloud all wrapped up in humidity
So for fun, I come down on stupidity
[Causin’?] in minutes ‘til the so-called street stuck
Like a light finished
Yo, Dutch, I’m finished

[Hook]
I fell asleep with this beat on repeat
We better than you, life seems to [creep?] me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man, please believe me
Trying to be a better man…
Trying to be a better man…
Please…  Please…
Trying… Got me battling my own mind state
At a divine rate.  I ain’t in it just to rhyme [weight?]
See, the truth has got me battling my own mind state
At a divine rate.  I ain’t in it just to rhyme [weight?]
See, the truth has got me battling my own mind state
At a divine rate.  I ain’t in it just to rhyme [weight?]
See, the truth… Please believe me…
