[Verse 1]
This for my juniors on JV
Looking at the coach just thinking “If they would play me”
The class of outcasts from children who just laugh
They wanna call me a name? Okay Im calling em’ back
Bastard
Introverted cause I just wanted to hurt them
The fire inside my belly was burning up to my sternum
I wanna just light a match throw em all in the gasoline
Just listen to how they scream
My God I swear it’s serene
I used to die in my dreams and wake up feeling pissed off
So lanky and plus the lent in my pockets would get me pissed on
Dirty apartments with roaches crawling the carpets
I’m always playing the victim of fights that I didn’t start
It’s a shame, mama was right, kids are cruel
Cause cool kids at our school aren’t cool if you aren’t cool
Taking twitpics out the back of a carpool
Me and papa resorting to blows whenever we argue
With all this going at home
I just wanna be all alone
But nobody ever listens, my difference put me at distance
You don’t know why I put my whole life inside of this music
You’d probably start yelling too if they all thought that you were stupid
But you worked hard in that class ad it’s never appreciated
Those kids just don’t like you either
Oh well least you got a playlist of songs you can listen to
When you feel like you wanna give just start bumping some of them tunes
And youll find a reason to live

[Verse 2]
This for my September Children
Hated for who you love so put a rope to the ceiling
Or poppin’ pain killers till the pills popped em’
Overdosing
Either that or getting called faggot and your bones broken
Thrown and choked by their own parents as if they provoked it
Helpless cause they felt an emotion and so they tried to show it
Stop worrying who other people choose to be
That goes both ways but for now Im just speaking musically
Drop your weed raps I still smoke so who am I to lie
But papa used to tell me only idle men idolize
So many idle minds Im still so different
So many thoughts I got to keep inside cause they won’t listen
Or play it in their systems let break up out of this
Take the power from these little cowards
Look whos down with this?
Refuse to drown in this pool of conformity they found me in
We’re not a mistake, were a majority
Misfits you can count me in

[Hook x2]
Label me, label me
Dumb, nerd, faggot, too tall, too small
Hop on the band wagon and

Label me, label me
Every girl and every boy is a resident of the Island Of MisFit Toys
