Yeah some people grind
And everybody hustle
That simply means you try
Just pieces of the puzzle
Some people use their mind
Others use their muscle
How're you defined?
True design or foolish struggle?
And pain seem like the theme to ya
Mind on the beat, knew ya
Might let me speak to ya
Some love money
Me? I love freedom
Treats? I don’t need ‘em
I’m already too sweet, um
That's sweet meaning nice
Your mantra's fiction
I'm a contradiction
Mean and nice
I'm a pizza slice with a side of beans and rice
Bein heated up by Jesus Christ
You couldn't see me twice
Using TiVo
I'm no fiend though
I won’t go pop on a weasel for green, yo
I mean I'll go chop up a beat for some cream
Oh, the green that I speak of’'s the root of all evil

He got his hat turned back
And his sneakers untied
Headphones, backpack
And he’s smiling wide
But he’s workin
All day
And when the sun goes down
And the feeling’s right
He puts down the pen
And picks up the mic
And he’s workin
All night
Yeah, that’s right

Cuz yeah I earn money
You could learn from me
You ain’t heard of me?
It’s no concern to me
Half of the time I'm Santa Clause with a backpack
History and math facts
It's who I am personally
Me as a human
You seen what I'm doin?
50-hour weeks I be tutoring
School’s an institution, me I’m independent
I think the grading is degrading and delaying true improvement
30 kids weekly depend on me
80 other kids are workin with my employees
And I own that company
We LLC
OK check the initials on my LL Bean
That's JAH
The most high
I stay floatin
Learnin more from teaching than I ever did as a student
That’s why I got no error in my syntax
You check for me on iTunes like my students check the index

He got his hat turned back
And his sneakers untied
Headphones, backpack
And he’s smiling wide
But he’s workin
All day
And when the sun goes down
And the feeling’s right
He puts down the pen
And picks up the mic
And he’s workin
All night
Yeah, that’s right

So just imagine it
Picture just a day
Wake up with no alarm clock consistently at 8
Check my emails and texts like everyone in the world
Cook some breakfast for myself and my girl
Read about some new debacle with the Knickerbockers
Peep some tweets and beats then, uhp, there’s a shocker
A parent is disparaging
Gotta change the schedule
This isn’t original
Repetitive, a ritual
On my phone
At the gym
I check prospective resumes
And text message some DJ’s between sets of bench press miseries
Bathe
Shave
Then I’m off on my journey
Hittin five houses daily
Teaching as I’m learning
When I was in school wasn’t for knowledge I was yearning
But now it’s my concern
Instantly earning while I’m working
Till ten o’clock I’m with these kids repairing all their grades
After that I’m at some venue straight tearing up a stage

He got his hat turned back
And his sneakers untied
Headphones, backpack
And he’s smiling wide
But he’s workin
All day
And when the sun goes down
And the feeling’s right
He puts down the pen
And picks up the mic
And he’s workin
All night
Yeah, that’s right
