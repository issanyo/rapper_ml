[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jamal HD]
Use to raise my daughter on Alief Clodine and D.A
Now we sippin XO in sessions when we get thirsty
Find my self giving a fuck lesser each day
Maybe because past don't come rewinds or replays
Illmind said this beat was Kanye's for the cop
But I did it cuz it went with kicks that I got
Came from nothin but when a nigga's future gave a little light
I couldn't help but think this heaven
Especially when it sounding like

(laughs)

[Verse 2: Jamal HD]
Whoa god
Please god
Please guard us
From black hoodies
Wit black faces and door knockers
Thats they pack similar to those coppers
That hate on us at stop lights where they stop us
And jealous motherfuckers in corners
Where they watch us
Plotting for the perfect day where they got us
Writing off HD bio like they authors
To see us on our back wit pastors standing over
Is what im dreaming a Lamborghini when it roll up
Or grey hoodie pack ah skittles and Arizona
Take advantage cuz when its ova nigga its over
If life ah bitch who you Ike Turner or Casanova
The world wanna kill me and honestly niggas outa
But who Im kidding feelin immortal living regardless
Yet still the tryda hold me under water
So everyday may they pray like ah father

[Verse 3: Jamal HD]
I could of sore ah long time ago
Before the grind before a line before a rhyme ago
When I was young and I was stun from what the world done show
And my MO from lack of doh it was my time to grow
And high school heroes years later niggas barely know
Finding comfort through ah pipe behind ah corner store
Girls sayin im the one and that its time to go
But back out call me a stranger when its time to stroke
I use to be the motherfucker that was full of jokes
Now I be the motherfucker full from folks
Feeding me that bullshit like Im far from dope
And what im tryna do they advise me don't
Of course I can change into suit from tee's
But I can't change the past cuz that'll change me
I can't ask God to forgive me for my sins
Because in the same breath that's forgiving me for my wins wait
