[Verse 1]
Whoa
My hearts beating slow
I don't know if it's the smoke from the dro
Or these hoes telling jokes at my shows
People hating on the low, like damn man y'all really gotta go that's fasho
Whoa
Everything's moving slow
I don't know if I'm stoned or how I'm getting home
I just know when I do I'm not waking up alone
Oh fasho mane you already know
Whoa
Step outside and the suns up just a young man on the come up
But I'm moving slow, so slow, like a dump truck
At least I'm not anything like these dumb fucks
Whoa
Excuse my use of profanity
But I'm in her mouth like I'm filling in a cavity
Actually, I could jump off of this balcony
And not even be held down by gravity
Going crazy like I really lost my sanity
Girl put me on like makeup when you're looking in a vanity
I'm a king in this thing you should call me your majesty
But for real you need to stop living in a fantasy

[Verse 2]
Rappers like us?
We don't ever make it
Always keep it real see?
I don't ever fake it
Never settle for anything less than the greatest
But what about your girl mane?
I guess I got impatient
Goddamn I'm so amazing
Run my hands up her thighs got her heart racing
Shining like a light bulb in a dark basement
I'm the one and only there will be no replacements
Pardon the rhyme scheme my minds dreams of fine things
I'm finding I can see life clearer without Visine
I'm climbing and the moons shining like a high beam
Other rappers whining how labels aren't signing
But I'm wining and dining dimes just to fuck up their spines
And grinding and rhyming rhymes just to abuse up my time
Rapping a little fast but I think it's still sounding fine
And I bet you've never heard anyone with a sound quite like mine
I can switch up the flow
And rip up these hoes
Kids'll be like goddamn this intro goes
Yeah yeah I know
This tape is too dope
That's why you're addicted and cannot say no
And I don't want you to go
Stay for a while and enjoy the show
Whoa
My hearts beating slow
This intro is done, Goodbye Adios
