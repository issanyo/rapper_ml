[Mr. J. Medeiros]
Welcome to the struggle
Where a poet’s gotta rhyme hustle
Going through it blind
Cus I know its more then mind and muscle
When the Divine humbles my pride crumbles
My eyes bubble with tears
Making it clear where I stumble
It’s like I’m double when in trouble I got two sides
My life’s a puddle till the sudden glimpse of blue skies
Carries the rain away it varies from day to day
No matter where we say we’ve changed
Remember Who remains the same
We sending prayers out in His name
With the hopes it might help you cope
Given the praise to God if you felt what I wrote
Head nodding till I melt into notes
Heart throbbing put a swell in my throat
Smooth sailing till we fell of the boat
Now we swimming in sin
Treading waiting for out ship to come in
Deep breath just before the water entered my chest
The Author of Life offers His life vest
