[Hook]:
Be a champion
Be a champion
Be the winner team champion even when they say it can't be done
You give me something to believe in
You give me something to believe in

[Verse One]:
Yo, What`s the point of living if it isn`t my way?
My city knew I`m driven that minute I hit the highway
Yo fuck a dead end job cause they do not pay
Monday I`ll be spending that money I`m due Friday
Another cash advance, so my phone will stay on
They talking with a fucking dead man like it's a seance
Homie I'm all the way gone, play when my debt is paid off
And I made off with that paper like I'm Madoff
And I`m getting nauseous, when they call me in they office
Cause the jobs that I was working, I was smarter than my bosses
My momma scoffin', like you see this
You could have finished school with As and Bs
Instead you working on that C-shift
She was conveying she felt ashamed to be working conveyor belts
Saying I need to develop my own education and maybe I'll save myself
That`s why I`m walking from the factory lines
No treading water now, my arms are busy practicing flying

[Hook]:
Be a champion
Be a champion
Be the winner team champion even when they say it can't be done
You gave me something to believe in
You gave me something to believe in
Be a champion
Be a champion
Be the winner team champion even when they say it can't be done
You give me something to believe in
You give me something to believe in

[Verse Two]:
And I`m living my days, working on minimum wage
Busy forgetting to pray, hoping to God I be given a raise
Telling them "Amen" when I pay rent
Hoping to never be late again
But I`m wishing that I could be living off one of my women like I was K-Fed
With a lame check and a work day
Manager leaving my nerves frayed
Pegging me under the table like I had been running away from an earthquake
No benefits, and no benefits
Having no sick days or co-pay
Feeling like Faith Hill whenever I`m sick and I`m praying it go away
We going late, and I'm feeling like I`m gonna crack Yeah
Cause half of the time, there isn't no time and a half
And they be sending me down in the back
And they be telling me all that I lack
I know when I`m better than all of them now that I`m leaving and not coming back
And if they want to put me up on them crosses
Instead of me punching clocks, I`ll be punching my bosses
If I ain`t running it then fuck it I`m walking
I`m a winner now, I`m cutting my losses
Baby cause I'm a champion

[Hook]:
Be a champion
Be a champion
Be the winner team champion even when they say it can't be done
You give me something to believe in
You give me something to believe in
Be a champion
Be a champion
Be the winner team champion even when they say it can't be done
You give me something to believe in
You give me something to believe in
