[Verse 1]
Blogs ain't support record this with no backing
I put my foot through the door like fuck it I dare you stop me
Got that silk on boxers like nigga hop off my dick
I mean it's blatten I fathered you, nigga that a nuttin
Yeah I came in aggressive that passive shit ain't work
'til girl started dropping that ass for that Nuvo fix
And nigga flexing his rent money you ain't it
Only time your burning through green When you light that spliff
I'm That Bronx kid wanna run for NEW YORK mayor globe trotter
Ratchet bitches, trappin it ain't fair
Cause I never moved keys but fans turning into feins how I'm serving up dope
Your calling it Trap P's [Trapeze], I call it that foreign currency
Haters don't worry me, while I watch my girls do the diplo
Ass to the floor in the clubs lights off major lazer while I'm yelling illmind can we make these bitches clap some
How did you figure that the bands won't make you dance
Constable on lock we got you in a trance, Dance floor packed do with it with no hands
I thought I told you we gone make it how we can Throw your hands up high for the man
Jump up In this bitch kicks straight from japan
Grab the mother fucking mic drops jams for the fans nigga fuck being local we're taking this shit global
I got my girl out in London, Pari next in that givanchi, got it all off of rap
Touring your girl no masseuse I've got some rich friends but still that shit ain't enough
We talking racks on racks and deposits talking bout condos up in Miami smoking that maui In those exotics
Tellin my niggas fuck it we got, let success speak for itself switch lanes and blowing that loud;
Don't talk much, but nigga we present, cause my present is a prescience on my Kanye kiss my ass
It's a harsh world word to my nigga Al Luciano; Cuban cigars got them links
And they hanging right off the chain, on a slave thing niggas only waiting for his whip
Give a toast to the new Maison Margiela like oh, lord
