[Intro]
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beat
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beat
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beat
Just clap your hands to the beatbox
Just clap your hands to the beat

[Verse 1]
I get up too late and I head to the classroom
I'm wondering why I'm wasting my time, losing my mind
Every day at school, they all laugh at me
They say, "Charlie Brown, you're such a tragedy."
Picking on me in the parking lot
Just swallow your pride don't cough it up

[Hook]
So I tell them hit the road
What you coming at me for
To all the people that hear me
You could win the fight
But no matter where the wind blows
Nothing ever goes my way
Ohh, woah

[Chorus]
No they won't stop chasing me anyway, anyway
And this black cloud follows me everyday, everyday
But I won't be my own worst enemy, enemy
They bring me down, I'm Charlie Brown

[Bridge]
*Whistling*
Lalala lalala la, la lala
Lalala lalala la, la lala
La a, la a, la a, la a

[Verse 2]
The kid is an outcast
Always kicked out class
They, they pointed fingers and say how will he outlast
Inconsiderate, the teacher's very omnipotent
They say that kids a problem where the fuck is his Ritalin
Uh, again and again I be stuck in these incidents
If hatred is the proof I can show you the evidence
And that's the type of world that all these kids is living in
So how could I give thanks when they don't know where the giving is

[Hook]

[Outro]
Nice try, Charlie Brown!
