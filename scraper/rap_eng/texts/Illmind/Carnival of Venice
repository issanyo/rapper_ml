Les
I'm tryna see the best of things
Lace my girl, 5 carats in her ring
Get my moms a crib, my pops a new whip
When it's all said and done - stack a mil for my kids
Work hard, play hard, stack dough, live well
Get away
Stay on an island in my own hotel
Got my little sister proud - like, check him out
She happy I put a pool in her house - she love to swim
I'm known for my taste in ladies
Plus a Murcielago and a pair of twin grey Mercedes
Staties leave me alone when I cruise the expressway
Can't touch me the community loves me
I'm on the news shaking hands
Had to give back
Salvation Army get a hundred grand
And - I own a company of which I'm the chair
I'm the boss, El Jefe premiere
And I'm knowin' they stare
When they see me at the Rolex store
On the low - the rose gold cost a hundred and 4
That's a house on the arm, couple cars on the wrist
Yea - success served cold is a remarkable dish
When they see me, yea - they might stand around for a photo
Watch for a king, got a crown for a logo
Owe it all to God, so the greatest, I thank
The whole team gettin' green, celebrate at the Bank
Yea- that volcano flow slow burn thru your stereo
You know what the business is, you know the scenario
Black Mozart flow, hated like the Taliban
With a black fur coat made of astrakhan
Thick in the club, man, you know I'mma turn up
Money here to get, homie, you know I'mma earn up
Ace for the entourage, bring the Methuselah
Envy make haters turn green like arugula
Still make a fool of you - 'Pagne (pain) in a gold bottle
Stunt hard these lames need a role model
Shorty with the pretty face that's my plus one
Feature presentation - word to Suss One
Gold on the wrist - no time for the gimmicks
Living a self-made "Sweet Dream" Annie Lennox
Class in session, hope you all in attendance
Puttin' the mask on for the Carnival of Venice
