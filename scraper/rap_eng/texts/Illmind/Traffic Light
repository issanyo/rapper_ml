Everyday when i wake up, wake up
They tell me to wake up, wake up
I dont know why the life i live its slow
Tell me what the laughing is this for
Dont be afraid to let go
Its late at night, i see a light
And it goes flashing through my soul
Am i loosing sight, is it all alright
I make these choices on my own
But it ain't over until its over
And i dont know which way to go

Said im sitting at the traffic light
And its flashing bright
Said im sitting at the traffic light, oh, oh
And i dont know which way to go

You say im rock but im not
Im hip hop but im pop
And all they label me as is a kid rock with a shot
So leave me alone and let me just sing
What i want to, because i got to
When i was a kid, my daddy played guitar
He showed me led zeppelin, the beatles and the doors
Yeah, it wasn't only rock and rock, hip hop was embedded on my soul
So how the fuck do they define me
My musics like a maze and all they do is try to find me
Why they gotta prime me
Open up and scrutinize pick a better person to pick on and fucking criticize
Dont let me, feel like that, listen to me then you can take the mic back
When will i get home

Said im sitting at the traffic light
And its flashing bright
Said im sitting at the traffic light, oh, oh
And i dont know which way to go x 2
