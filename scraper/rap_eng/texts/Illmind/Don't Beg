[Diamond D]
Woooooo~!

[Chorus: Diamond D]
You know that's the shit a lot of dudes just dig to see {beg}
But at the end of the day, you can maintain your dignity so don't {beg}
Go on and humble yourself, it's too big to me, I don't {beg}
Cause if I put out, you gon' have to pay the vig to me so don't {beg}

[Diamond D]
Listen, how I look with my hand out?
Now that's one thing that you can't doubt
And we all want to expand out (right), but show some reserve
Or the left'll make you land out
Damn begging ass dudes, no one likes 'em
When there's a jump-off no one invites 'em
Dawgs, it's just too much
You wanna blow on the kush but can't spring for a dutch
C'mon; I heard it all before
You all ready - yo dukes, run to the store
Fuck it, you know, man I don't cop
And you ain't payin for the shit, just don't get stopped
C'mon, see, we all have our place
And I'm not arrogant, we all have our space
But, but I can see a leech
Trust me fam its squizzy I can see a reach, c'mon
Fuck out of here

[Chorus]

[Diamond D]
Yeah you pop up on the scene, holdin your nut
And I ain't even cracked it yet, and you holdin a cup
Wanna tag along - yo D, I'm rollin whats up?
Okay you twist for the night, now you rollin whats up
Listen, I know it's hard out here
It's way too much avant garde out here
Look, look, you need to find a skill
Learn to stand on your feet fam, find the will
Because, nobody likes a beggar
Matter fact, in the 90's you borrowed my Sega
Look, look, we still Kool and the Gang
We celebrate the good times like Kool and the the Gang
But, but, what you need to do
Is get your hustle on and bubble, heed the two
Listen, fuck a handout, get it yourself
Cause at the end of the day you gotta live with yourself so don't...

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, stand on your motherfuckin feet or go have a seat
Squizzy (squizzy)
