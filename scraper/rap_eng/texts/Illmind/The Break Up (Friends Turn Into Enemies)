[Emilio Rojas]
Now I been losin' sleep to my anxiety, this world is full of fiends
I’m losin' friends to my sobriety, no one’s what they seem
My girl just spent the whole night cryin' for me
She swear to god I cheat so every time I step outside the crib
She beg me not to leave, I know relationships need trust
And we don’t got enough, y’all findin' friends
I’m findin' alibis inside the club, nowadays I’m talkin' less
Every conversation leads to arguments
And I don’t care who right or wrong, I just want it all to end
I started textin' other broads again
‘Cause you just been accusin' me non-stop
I might as well do what you thought I did
And I been harborin' resentment so it’s hard to a keep a friendship
When your heart just isn’t in it girl
It’s hard to keep pretendin', all my dogs is tellin' me
That I should leave like yo, you bad for my career
You say you not, I believe you, ain’t no spark
And we ain’t fuckin', we can’t come to an agreement
I’m addicted to the drama, I don’t love it but I need it
We been screamin' at each other, other day, I almost hit you
Shit, I never thought of touchin' a woman till I was with you
And that scares me, now I don’t like that side of me
If you don’t understand why I been driven
How the fuck you plan to ride for me?
It been bubblin' inside of me, I’ve been dealin' with it quietly
Are you strugglin' with trust ‘cause I don’t struggle with monogamy
Truth is, it don’t really make a difference
‘Cause it don’t matter if I’m honest if you still are askin' questions
We been stressin' over money, we been beefin' over bills
And keepin' track of who been spendin' what
That petty shit’ll kill ya, I don’t care ‘bout other bitches though
I’m grown, I’ve had my fill, I’m tryna lay this foundation
That the both of us can build from, we supposed to have some children
And adopt your nephew and get a condo in the lower
With an Audi and a dog we rescued
Sometimes I wish that it could all be simple
But ain’t no way that’s gon happen
When you think about the shit we been through
Your father hit you, shit, you hinted at him touchin' you
It’s probably why you love to call me daddy when I’m fuckin' you
You validate yourself through sexuality and love from dudes
And girl, it’s been a while for us so tell me who you runnin' to
You stayin' late at work and sleepin' out
Got me feelin' like a guest in my own house
Shit, I been sleepin' on the couch
Comin' home in clothes I know you can’t afford
And it’s crazy, who been buyin' them for you
‘Cause girl, I know it ain’t me
Who been takin' you for dinner? You don’t eat at home
Already know the answers to these fuckin' questions
I should leave ‘em ‘lone, shit, I don’t even know you lately
You a stranger and the closer that I get to my success
The more you change up, you claim you want me winnin'
But with every little victory gon’ come another argument
You bitch and talkin' shit to me
You beggin' me to keep you company in all your misery
You tellin' me you’d die for me but you refuse to live with me
See women in my industry and call ‘em like I’m fuckin' ‘em
But I’m just workin' with these girls
You think I fall in love with ‘em
And after that shit happen, when I see ‘em, I be duckin' ‘em
‘Cause I don’t want the drama to catch up with us
I know I should be done with us
But somethin' keep me here and keep you with me
Conversations give you more ammunition to use against me
Try to see you, you won’t let me and you text me like you miss me
How the fuck your full lips feel empty when you kiss me?
Wish it was different, yeah, but girl, it isn’t
And now the one that I can’t live without is not the one I live with
I been out with different women every night just to forget it
But it don’t feel the same, now somethin' missin'
Somethin' feelin' out of place, ain’t no reachin' you
What the fuck you wantin' me to do? You’re dead to me
Now I ain’t gettin' over you, I’m grievin' you
You made an enemy of someone who believed in you
But somethin' ‘bout us make me wanna be with you, damn
