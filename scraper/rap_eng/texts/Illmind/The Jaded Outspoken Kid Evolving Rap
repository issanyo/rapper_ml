[Verse 1: JOKER]
I'm blasting off with a rocket ship attached to my pocket, cocking it back and popping it pressed against your noggin
Cause I don't think that you're rotten, you're just egging me on, Cutting you up inside a hospital, like Beth did to Dawn
I'm attempting to bomb every rapper stuck in the dawn of the planet, if you don't want to be called an ape, then don't act like one
You say you're smart and you understand all my rhymes but you gotta snort kool-aid in order to get my punch lines
Wheels turning without being lubricated, your girl makes noises for me that for you she would be faking
It's fake and lame the way you pay for your fame but I'd rather dive out of a plane head first than play your games
Again with the bombing, Jon, please would you stop it, you're scaring me with your lyrics, I'm fearing that you're psychotic
I thought that we were past this, please listen to my past shit, or at least take the time to read all of the songs on the tracklist
You're trackless, but still would like to give me advice on how to be the best rapper alive in your eyes
But I can't tailor who I am just so I'm characterized as a "real rapper" by some criticizing strangers online
All I can do is take your comments with a sip of wine while you whine from behind a computer monitor
And now you bitches are coming at me and commenting your lies insisting that I went and stole my moniker, but I'm all JOKER

[Verse 2]
I'm the jaded outspoken kid evolving nothing, but please don't take that seriously, I was only JOKEN
Really I'm a token, a bloke who wants to keep you focused by sticking your noggin through the noose in a rope and kicking the chair out from under you to watch as you choke, I'm not loco, I just thought you should know that since you smoke, your lungs were breathing toxic chemicals and you would die anyway, so who fucking cares when you croak
You try to stay calm but lyrically I drop bombs, better call Saul Goodman if you're feeling distraught
You listen to my hearty flow and everything I'm pumping
"But he's white, he's just a wannabe Macklemore or something"
I'm whiter than Eric Foreman, but I do not resent him
At that 70th show of mine I'll still be spitting venom
Feeling like a better version of myself, being a virgin doesn't help, but at least I'm not infected
I'm 16 years old in a country of rich men, if money doesn't grow on it, then who'd they rob to get ahead?
Every student self-medicating with sudafed would do so much better if they had the option to clear their heads
But overtop of them is this cloud of tuition debt or maybe they want to be dead because they fail every test and their parents will bring them hell if they can't break free from their shells but if your tank is on empty  you can't keep fueling yourself

[Verse 3]
It's hard being a kid when inside you want to be big but when you're grown you will wish you could go back and just live
Youth is wasted on us, if we let go of the drama, we would all be better off, so why exacerbate your problems?
Oh yeah, because without them our lives are boring, and we feel so unimportant cause no one wants us to forfeit
But still fuck a hater for giving me these endorphins, thinking I've gone corporate cause I have these vacaciones
So extravagante, chupe mi pene if you think I'll sit back while my family has the summer of a lifetime
You only live once, but fuck saying yolo like it's a reasonable excuse to lose your mind
I'm here to live it up as intelligently as I can, but what I don't understand is why these teenagers can't just enjoy life without partying to excess and not protecting themselves when they're having their drunken sex
And they cry when they get pregnant
But if they had been prepared they prolly wouldn't be parents
I don't think we have to live life to the barest, but maybe you should think of the cause and effect before you act careless
And maybe eat carrots once a day, it would at least explain your rabbit-like craving for getting laid
I'm not preaching some sermon, but before you go Tyler Durden you should think of how the things you do can affect a person
