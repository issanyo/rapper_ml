Can't nobody touch my swag

Wanna hang with my bros, yeah, I gotta know
Boy you know you're so rough, baby, rock my show
Yeah these diamonds on my rock, nigga yeah I'm rockin' gold

[Chorus]
Let you know, I'ma let you know
You can't keep 'em close, diamonds they so froze
Water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast
She know I'm a soldier, girl, I'll let you know

Prolly on your poster, get that guap just like I'm posin'

Diamonds they so froze (Yeah!), water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast

[Verse 1]
80k a show, 100k a show (Alright)
Why my neck so frozen? Why my Rollie golden?
Walking with my .40, and my money showing
Walking with that stunned AP, my money ain't foldin
Boy I am not slow, you hate on the low
You was still at home, I was on the road
Know that I'm a dog, I'm bad to the bone
Dior my cologne, smoking gas it's strong
Leave me alone, stop calling my phone
Already know what you're thinking lil baby, girl, oh what up though?
She said "Uzi baby, they ain't got no dough"
Why you're so dope? Yeah, you oughtta know

[Chorus]
Let you know, I'ma let you know, you can't keep 'em close
Diamonds they so froze, water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast
She know I'm a soldier, girl, I'll let you know
I done let you know, diamonds they so froze, water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast
Prolly on your poster, get that guap just like I'm posin'
Get that thot just like I

[Verse 2]
Boy you took that L and we can see that
Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, daredevil could see that
Pockets giant just like Andre, addicted, let me do 3 stacks
I get money, fuck your bitch, stay real, ooh, that's three facts
Diamonds on my fist, my wrist, my grill, ooh, I mean that
Made your girl swallow my dick like a pill, ooh, don't relapse
She keeps stalking on my phone, think this thing's tapped
Diamonds all up on my pinky, think this thing's tap
I do not fuck with these niggas, man I mean that
Woah, money envelope
I was just so broke, I didn't have hope
Now I'll

[Chorus]
Let you know, I'ma let you know, you can't keep up close
Diamonds they so froze, water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coasta
She know I'm a soldier, girl, I'll let you know
I'm a let you know, diamonds they so froze, water like a boat
Spanish girl named Rosa, and she from the coast, yeah
Prolly on your poster, get that guap just like I'm posin'
Get that thot just like I

Wanna hang with my gang? Yeah, I gotta know
