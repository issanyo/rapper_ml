[Interlude]
Your choice is simple: Join us and live in peace
Or pursue your present course and face obliteration
We shall be waiting for your answer

[Verse 1: A-Dre]
I'm the answer to your prayers
I've been asked to become a slayer
And I'm here to declare; you don't have to worry
I've warned these weak Emcees
Whether or not they get mad at me
It's no one's fault I flow nicely with ease
I aim to please, keep my distance from cheap ones like coupons
They keep on pleading me to stop
I'm never off the clock
Sought out to gain a name in the game, at the top
Something like the sniper that shot
Kennedy on his noggin'
I'm rhyming about nothing ordinary when pertaining to legendary status
Glad this is merely a small step for my success to come
I'm feeling enemies have become scared near me
They fear me, they can't think clearly
Nothing really can compare, to my invincible flair
Unpredictable every year, you're predictable everyday, you're doing typical stuff
Why lie? Why bluff? Too many white lies
I've had enough, of these so called "artists"
So I'm going the hardest, flawless in this spittin' business
Been doing this for four years, Performing for all my peers
Welcoming cheers, ignoring sneers
Making sure I steer to the right career, Staring at my path with no fear
In the future you'll look back at my past, definitely reminisce and revere my success
A-Dre!

[Interlude 2]
The decision rests with you

[Verse 2: Johnny Parker]
Nevermind that mu'fucka' we made it
Temper on my back, hail to this rap shit
I swear, I (been) rapping for too long
Took long but I came in dissing a couple of you
(Ive) Got this game at a W
Most of this fame is a double you
I ain't here to wait, not gonna wait to come on through
I'm in here to do what I gotta do
I'mma do, I'mma do, I'mma do me
Stay back, stay strapped, I'm on the flee
Gotta get, gotta spend all of that green
All of them, I'mma spray all that Febreeze
Honestly, all of these stink
Epic like the Odessey scene
They asking man, "How does he sing?"
I ain't none of that Glee
Ho, I'm the whole rap scene, bitch

[Verse 3: Backbone]
I'm beginning to feel like the King of Brownsville
People jealous of me because my sound's ill
Murder, pop, lock and drop cause my flow's so hot
Drop the act, show me what you've got
Shot on the block, call the cops; don't care
I grab that mic and they stop and stare
Voice in my head like a mental asylum Bodies, I pile 'em up and I light 'em up, and ignite the fire
I'm trying to make it big and these haters won't buy it
You can hear it on the track, that every time it make a rap, the King of rap is me
And all these other suckers standing back
Amazing what I cold do with my tongue-tongue
Rap fast, stand back, cick clack
Brrrrat-at-tat-tat
Blah blap!!

[Interlude 3]
You have underestimated our lyrical abilities
Tranquility is no more, therefore there will be no hesitation
We've been patiently waiting, but the Production must rise
It has begun; Welcome, to a New Gen

[Verse 4]

[Backbone]
Backbone, that man; king of the rap band
Dark Knight; Batman! Back-hand; Smack!
Damn!

[A-Dre]
Trapped in my lyricism, emphasis on my vision
The whole universe should hear my verse
I'm all about the peace, but if you want a piece of me, I guarantee you're gonna get beat completely
Ballin' like Kirby and Kobe on a cold beat!


[Johnny Parker]
(Be)'Coming the illest in this rap shit
We be listening to Wu-Tang, now they listen to that all new, New Gen
