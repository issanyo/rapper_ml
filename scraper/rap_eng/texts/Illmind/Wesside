[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know you comin' home with me
I said wassup ma, you know you comin' home with me
Yeah, we ridin' down the wesside
I got a bad little ting up on my left side
I said wassup ma, you know you comin' home with me
I said aye, aye, wassup, you comin' home with me
Aye, we ridin' down the wesside
I got a bad little ting up on my left side
I said, yeah, you know you comin' home with me
I said wassup ma, you know you comin' home with me

[Verse]
Aye, yo I met her at Griffon, she had no inhibitions
Crushed her '30 Impali, lined it up when she sniffed it
Gettin' money from dancin', wasn't doin' the strippin'
Did a couple of videos but she wasn't a vixen
Okay, I been so numb, I didn't know that I was feelin' her
Quick to put a dude in his place like a realtor
Uh, now I'll be real witcha, ya isn't my type
But I like how ya approached me so let's kick it tonight
She said, uh, okay I'm with it, I asked her what she sippin'
If she want another one, she said, nah, I know my limit
Cool, now don't be timid, you ain't gotta be shy
I got the Uber outside, if you want, we could slide and that's why...

[Hook]
We ridin' down the wesside
I got a bad little ting up on my left side
I said wassup ma, you know you comin' home with me
I said aye, aye, wassup, you comin' home with me
Aye, we ridin' down the wesside
I got a bad little ting up on my left side
I said, yeah, you know you comin' home with me
I said wassup ma, you know you comin' home with me

[Outro: Female Voicemail & (Emilio)]
I know you don't check your voicemail
But I'm pretty sure you're gonna check this one, ya little homo
(Oh shit)
Lemme explain somethin' to you
If you're upset and you have mommy issues and sister issues
'Cause your sister's fuckin' bipolar and your motha's a whore
(Emilio laughing)
She's the one that sucked that wetback's fuckin' dick
She shoulda swallowed you instead of fuckin' pop your ass out
Like seriously, leave my daughter alone
I'm not playin' with you Emilio, you could take this with the fuckin' cops
I got lawyer money, you don't even got rent money, okay?
You and your fuckin' wetback little fuckin' girlfriend that you have now
You know what? You guys, you're a wetback, she's a wetback
It's perfect, stay the fuck away from my daughter Emilio
(Yo, you fuckin' Puerto Rican, you crazy bitch, ah my god)
I'm, I am not even fuckin' playin' with you
Call me back if you're a fuckin' man which I know you're not already
Call me back, let's deal with this as two fuckin' adults
Let's see where it goes from there, faggot
(Ah, she's fuckin' crazy)
