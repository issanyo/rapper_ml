Malota
Return of the Mola, Postmortem
Never came close to folding. I'm still holding
Still showing you the ways of the lost golden years of rap
Hold my cognac. I'm bout to go in

You'll be surprised I'm leaving when I rev the exhaust quick
Exercise my demons like the devil does cross fit
Your team's even-Steven with the levels I crossed bitch
Your whole crew's manure, g'head and revel in horse shit

Mic Jesus. My cross to bear and still carry it
Cam'ron on a horse and carriage. I'm on a chariot
Pisces Iscariot. Ignite a lariat and
Swing it around a fire and nick cannons. Hilarious

America's got talent. Who wanna move on?
Aware of all my challengers. Shit is lukewarm
I'm there with all my management, with a suit on
And Erica toss salads, who wanna crouton?

I'm in a Rolls with fifty shades of grey poupon
Condoms my condiments, I'm trying to get my Groupon
You Living Social or Living Single? You trying to mingle?
Kringle like Chris, Pringle like chips, dog - Bingo

Biased to Bilas, but shout out to Trey Wingo
I gotta go to work on the track. I Kraft Singles
Grilled Cheese, I'm filthy when I fill these lines
With words that I got to rhyme at least sixteen times
