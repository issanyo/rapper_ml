[Verse 1]

I´m looking at the sky beyond the limits
Mine is infinite. Illmind symphonies, Cres lyrics
I don´t care anymore about critics
Nope. I create, all you do is destroy, take note. No gimmicks
Flow´s so smooth, yeah, mad nice. Eyes closed
I´m in the booth, rhyme paradise. Oh
The wave sounds are in me. Why the fuck are you signed if you sing like Britney?
Things like that, that I don´t understand
It´s kind of like women behavior, damn!
Can´t live with out them, hard to live with them...
This shit is serious man...fo real
I was put here to make things happen;
And I really make things happen, word!
On the track no fears, the mic is like I steer
And I´m a drive my rappin all over the world
Yep!

[Verse 2]

Look it´s 3:10, a.m. on a friday, uhm I love it coz I´m writing...
Ojos cerrados, oscuridad, estoy en el espacio...
Hay música y gravedad, repito y no me sacio
No me sacio, I need this like O2
My heart beats, the beat´s in my heart, is all you
It´s all you
Vivo enganchado
Describo un estado;
No me preocupa el resultado
No no, no no, mira los pies se han despegado
Don´t ask me how? Shit, escribía y ha pasado y ya está...
Sale de mí, qué quieres que te diga?
Sale de mí; a tí te cuesta la vida
Lo siento, I´m sorry for you, for you, for you...
Lo siento I´m sorry for you
If your flow ain´t shit, man what cha want me to do?

I did tried to tell you they´re not me
We are way beyond, way beyond, way beyond...
They can´t see (that) hate is not the way
Love is and is way beyond anything...
