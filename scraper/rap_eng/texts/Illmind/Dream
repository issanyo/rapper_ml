[Verse 1: vChenay]
Lately, I'm just going through the motion
My mind is filled with thoughts about you, thoughts about it
Captivating, like the waves in the ocean
I don't know what's real
But I got this feeling about you, got this feeling about us

[Refrain: vChenay]
[?] that I had an obsession
[?] that I made sure you don't get the wrong impression

[Pre-Chorus: vChenay]
'Cause I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love ya

[Chorus: vChenay]
Have you ever thought about me?
'Cause all I wanna do is think about you
Baby, are you with it?
Are you with it, are you with it?
If you want it, come get it

[Verse 2: vChenay]
Waiting, like stars in the sky
Can't shine 'til the night
Let's get lost, explore this reality
Can't sleep, my eyes wide open
Wondered how it would feel
To have your body next to mine, right now

[Refrain: vChenay]
We're just humans, baby, we just need a little affection
Believe it when I say that all you need is some sessions

[Pre-Chorus: vChenay]
'Cause I just wanna love ya
I just wanna love ya

[Chorus: vChenay]
Have you ever thought about me?
'Cause all I wanna do is think about you (It's all I wanna do)
Baby, are you with it?
Are you with it, are you with it? (Tell me if you with it)
If you want it, come get it

Have you ever thought about me?
'Cause all I wanna do is think about you (you, you, you)
Baby, are you with it?
Are you with it, are you with it?
If you want it, come get it
