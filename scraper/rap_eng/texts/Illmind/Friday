[Chorus]
I can see a body drop right now
I laugh at a nigga right now
In the Hellcat, I'm switching them out
Ridin' round with your bih givin' mouth
I'm in her tonsils right now (I'm smokin' big dope)
This shit ain't new to me
I'm getting a whole lotta money, this shit ain't new to me
Fridays, I'ma Pinky, nigga
Heavy D, I'm smoking cookie, nigga
Ice Cube, beat the shit out you nigga
(Damn, son)
And I send a shot like Big Worm
Smoking your pack like I'm Smokey, nigga
Big dog, I done fuck with Felicia
Deebo, I mistreat 'em

[Verse 1]
You a cartoon, washed out
Hand me down, not a lot of rounds
Come around, we strip a nigga down (Yeah)
Pants down, money giving out (Yeah)
Itch now, took your chain nigga (What), Deebo
Slimeball with a ego, turn a nigga subzero
It's cold outchea... (It's cold out here)
Im a cold hearted motherfucka
Don't trust me? I wipe you out (I'll wipe you out)
You got the bricks and you got the bags
Ima sends young niggas in your house (Young niggas in ya house)
I don't care what you talk about (Naw)
I got guns and I got shooters
You got guns, and you got shooters (Okay)
Well show me what you talk about? (What you talkin' 'bout)
I'm in the real one (I'm in the real one)
O the block with the real ones (Real ones)
Hang in the block with them niggas that pull up and kill you (Pull up and kill you)
Nigga, for a lil one (Lil one)
It's nothing to me (It's nothin')
Shit, it's nothing to me
Get a nigga wet for a couple racks (Yeah)
That shit ain't nothing to me (That shit ain't nothing to me)

[Chorus]
I can see your body drop right now
I laugh at a nigga right now
In the Hellcat, I'm smashin' in route
Ridin' round with your bih givin' mouth
I'm in her tonsils right now (I'm in her tonsils)
This shit ain't new to me
I'm getting a whole lotta money, this shit ain't new to me
Friday's on my pinky, nigga (Friday)
Heavy D, I'm smoking cookie, nigga (Heavy)
Ice Cube, beat the shit out you nigga (Ice)
And I send a shot like Big Worm (Big worm)
Smoking your pack like I'm Smokey, nigga (Smokey)
Big dog, I done fucked with Felicia
Deebo, I mistreat her

[Verse 2]
150, bitches and titties
Countin' that green, get in between
Lets have a party, Percocet machine
Fucking these bitches and selling hoes a dream (Yeah)
I just be selling white cream (Cream)
Ice cream call me snowman (Snowman)
Getting money, no broke man (Broke man)
False claiming you a hoe man (You a hoe man)

Niggas be talkin' bout none of these niggas (None of these niggas)
Pfff, you lil' bitty niggas (You lil bitty niggas)
Pfff, you lil' bitty niggas (Fuck wrong with you niggas?)
Pfff, you lil' bitty niggas

[Chorus]
I can see your body drop right now (Got it)
I'll laugh at a nigga right now (Ha)
In the Hellcat, I'm smashin' in route
Ridin' round with your bih givin' mouth
I'm in her tonsil right now
This shit ain't new to me
I'm getting a whole lotta money, this shit ain't new to me
Friday's on my pinky, nigga (Friday)
Heavy D, I'm smoking cookie, nigga (Heavy)
Ice Cube, beat the shit out you nigga (Ice)
And I send a shot like Big Worm (Big Worm)
Smoking your pack like I'm Smokey, nigga (Smokey)
Big dog, I done fucked with Felicia
