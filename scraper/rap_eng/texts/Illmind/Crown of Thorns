[Intro]
I used to believe if I played by your rules
I'd win, I’d win, I'd win
All these thorns in me proves our gods are feared
By men and I ain't gonna save you now

[Verse One]
I’m from a small town, small minds, trouble fittin' in
When I skated through my city, it was different then
And I ran with gangstas that was on parole
Or students on that honor roll
Left catholic school in seventh grade
I can't believe in god no more (Amen)
'Cause they told me Emilio, follow your dreams
And you could be gettin' whatever you want
And you could be anything that you believe
I got on my knees and prayed to beat it, it was futile
We never had males around us growin' up
I learned to tie a tie on Youtube
Tryna find out how to sue them, only smoke until they stupid
Doin' harder drugs, if it was put it front of them, they'd use it
There was aliens in my family but me, I’m only human
I’m what happens after Jesus learned his only friend was Judas
Everybody who's around me, they really wanna con me
They really wanna drown me
Wanna get slick with a little bit of bread
But they gonna get it right when I hit ’em with accountin'
Everyone that I trust dead or they locked up in that county
So it's time to take these fuckin' thorns and crown me, amen

[Hook]
I used to believe if I played by your rules
I’d win, I'd win, I'd win
All these thorns in me proves our gods are feared
By men and I ain't gonna save you now
I ain't gonna save you now, I ain't gonna save you now
I ain't gonna save you now, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no
I ain't gonna save you now, I ain't gonna save you now
I ain't gonna save you now, no, no no, no, no, no, no, no

[Verse Two]
Say a prayer for me, dear god, say a prayer for me
If hell is freezin' over, tell the angels send some flares for me
Gave these dudes careers, it's like I ran a fuckin' charity
Why they mentionin' my name with all these lames that don't compare to me?
I shoulda been blown by now, I should been known by now
But I guess that it coulda been worse, I coulda been gone by now
Everything coulda been over now
Whey coulda been rippin' the posters down
But I hold my ground, crushin' the world in my hands
I am shruggin' it off of my shoulders now
We wasn't supposed to make it
We wasn't supposed to break in
We wasn't supposed to get all this dough
We wasn't supposed to rake in
I'm sittin' in first class with a leather duffle
I'm thinkin' fuck 'em, they never got dirt on they hands now
'Cause they never hustle, I came from nothin' man
I came from nothin', they wanted to crucify me
But I broke the nails they tried to hang me up with
You better believe I'm makin' 'em pay for all the pain and sufferin'
We not the ones that they should fuck with, amen

[Hook]
