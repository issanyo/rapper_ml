[Intro]
This ain't R&B smooth
I ain't a R&B dude
This ain't R&B smooth
I ain't a R&B dude
This ain't R&B smooth
I ain't a R&B dude
Turns the lights on
I got bars in the room

[Verse 1]
In a room fully loaded
So truthfully the flow is
Covering every one of them that you was trynna roll with
I do this off the open
I'm truthfully the dopest
So they cover they arms thinking you ain't even notice
Addicted to the bass line
Posted by the monitor
Close enough to think that she can see it when the volume up
Kickin' got her trippin' but she trippin' for the top of us
Shout out the needles and whatever the Serato does
Independence Day the way shorty hold the bottles up
Play the part well
Word to Gordon Gartrelle
In my Gordon Gartrelle y'all can turn this to a runway
They say my car alarm is like a Juliet Sunday

[Hook]
What we on
Is what you need
And what you want
Is where it leads
Until we gone
We what it be
Word to the drums
You know what it be
You know what it be
Atypical
Call it Atypical
Atypical
Call it Atypical
Atypical
Call it Atypical
If you can play along shorty
You can play typical

[Bridge]
She play along as long as we get the picture
Well I got that off the jump
She wantin' me jumpin' with her
I say I got that off the pump
Off of whatever she live for
She living for exactly when I get her
Exactly

[Verse 2]
And I got her from the outset
Know what I'm about yep
Know I'm from the borough cause my sneakers wasn't out yet
She got cherry reds on
Murder for her outfit
Reach across the table baby you gettin' the couch wet
BBM Pin game
Acapella flirtin'
BBM pen game
I be sellin' verses
But back to the surface
I'm back by the demand
And her battery dying so she tattin' on her hand
And her battery tryin' to react to how she panned
And I'm plannin' on this Henny to be Black
That's the plan
And she standin' on the table like she paid for it to be there
The bass made a way for me to see there

[Hook]
[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Nothin' more exact then the way the be at this
My fitted is the same as no one else's if you askin'
My shit is a lane you couldn't pay to get a pass in
Baskin'
Past it
Center of my attraction
Asked if
Face in the flow
Like she reacted
As if
Facing a glow like that's a package
The back end is everything she hopin' it would be
And the bass still close enough to see
So know that

[Hook]
