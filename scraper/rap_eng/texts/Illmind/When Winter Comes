Intro]
See look
Umm when it's almost over, and when winter comes it's really like beautiful because it's just white

[Pre-Verse][2x]
They killed the old me but I'm too alive
How can you be the one when I'm still alive?
All I got is time
All I got is time

[Verse 1]
One beat, one womb, one November night
Two beings, two souls, one potential life
Three names, one suffix, I conceive dreams
Giving myself instead of a gimmick or a theme
Heart on Willie Cager, creativity on Basquiat
Gifted by God, but working like I ain't got a lot
Heat I spit you listening to, even make your momma hot
Feeling pressure, Worm told me you gotta drop
Im dropping harder than expectations we got for one another
Won't be in the shadows, no, I ain't Steph Curry brother
Young Daniel Radcliffe they trying to keep me in the cupboard
I'ma dog leave your white tee looking like you went to Southern
With lines I spit
Joy, struggle, and pain
In and out like an A.I. crossover or west coast burger chain
They know I'm willing and Abel
Got the keys but I never sold Cain
Shit a shame how the game done changed
Rappers be two nickels short of dime in they mind
If I gotta break a dollar for them to get it , then I'm inclined
Caveman flows and metaphors, for me they gotta dig
Grind harder than a NFL player knees without a cartilage
It's everybody I'm targeting, I ain't deep I'm bottomless
You sold your soul so well, you ain't need marketing

[Verse 2]
Accidental pregnancy, niggas made it apparent
They throw stones, my pain is something I ain't open to sharing
I'm at my own funeral, the old me is what I'm burying
This ain't the AJ niggas laughed and picked at at Marian
Ain't the AJ that got railroaded by the state
It ain't the AJ that'll hold all of his pain behind his face
Trying to balance the ying and yang while trying to keep it true
I've evolved but see a shallow being when I peek at you
Rap like East Side High, I see everybody dropping out
I hold myself to a high standard, y'all got cotton mouth
I never was a talker, but somehow I always went harder
When explaining that my heart darker than Luke Skywalker father
The ball in my hand, I see no need to audible
Knock it off the hinges when I'm at a door, y'all spit a lot of bull
I'm still holding on like LeBron hair follicles
The physical manifestation of anything is possible

[Outro][2x]
They killed the old me but I'm too alive
How can you be the one when I'm still alive?
All I got is time
All I got is time
