( Verse 1 )
It's a one time fuck i told myself
I lied ,time and time again
It just made my heart melt
You gotta love your self before you love any one else
Because if you don't foes will bring demons
And demons will bring more demons and they will invite more
You have to have a certain level of real within ya core
I'm not saying to not be a hoe or anything
I'm just saying you have to notice who loves you dearly
This a letter to my fans who are just like me ,I write this note sincerely
There's more i want to say but first i want to say
(Hook)*4
Love Yourz
(Yeah Love Yourz)
Keep that real in your core to notice who love you dearly
(Who loves you dearly )

( Verse 2 )
The sad thing about this game we call love is that you can never win
You can never be to sure who to give your heart to and who to give ya trust to
You just gotta hope your consumer ain't here now and gone later
Now here's a message to my baby
Baby you drive me crazy
I'm proud to call you my lady
We both needa get to that money like we hustling like bonnie and clyde
Just know anyone talking to you crazy i'd
Ride and die for ya
I don't know what more to say other
Than i love you baby
