Que te pasa?
You ain't got no wins en mi casa? [x 8]
Que te pasa?

[Verse 1]
Dead in the middle like a stir fry pan
From the crossover era used to hit em like Shan
God, called upon when you down
Move a pawn when it's war
Pop a collar like Fonz
Damn! I'm 1-0-1 like a Mona
Lease-a new Ferrari got me looking like a foreigner
Yeah, both hands wash the face
Both eyes on the safe
Got cops on the take
They're saying I'm the successor of Christopher Lee Rios
These other Latinos hating
I told them "cry me a rio"
These niggas Owen like T-O
Put them on a T-O
George Gervin in the Spur
Both fingers frio
Talk about work, but you lie like Leo
Say you got work, but you lie like a Leo
Had to say it twice, I ain't trying to be nice
You rap niggas is sick
But that flu last the night

[Bridge]
Everybody wanna do what a player do
But everybody can't do what a player do
I see you player, all in the mix, right?
I see you player, yeah I got my shit right

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
From the depths of the beast
Back to the streets
P-A-P-I from the, the, the East
City Is Mine like Jigga in '97
When Mase wrapped it up
Trying to buy his way to Heaven
I'm Hellbound in the back of a Greyhound
Passing through the state lines looking poised
Move in silence, sleep on the rest
There's noise
Mind state like a marine
So I need a bigger cut when my buzz grow
And I ain't taking less like Ludlow
"No" like Mutumbo
There's a place to be humble
And a time to let guns go
How you want it? My jeans is 3 hundo
These ain't Lee's, these A-P-C's
Top to custom, move any 14 K from 98 on my neck
Pay for each of appearance, charge for each step
Motherf*cker should check
Tanboys get pesos

[Bridge]
