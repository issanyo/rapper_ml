It’s just a room
Four walls and a floor
Yeah it’s a venue
To us it’s a menu
Men who genuinely aren’t gentle
Play an instrumental
It turns to a temple
Just you wait
Adjust your fate
It fluctuates when I waltz in the door
I once was ignored
But that was just once
And I winced a little bit but now there’s jaws on the floor
When I spit a little shit I’m like The Riddler on Ritalin
No fiddling with middlemen
It’s four times four
Bars
Clubs, bars, pubs
I fill them up like jars, jugs
Chew em
Spit em
Cigar stubs
But the music isn’t mine
It’s ours, us
We is the pronoun
Cuz the scene that I’ve seen is obscenely serene how it goes down

Hey yo
Look around you
Look at what surrounds you
All the faces
And the place is
So amazing
Good gracious
Whatchu all about?
(The scene)
Whatchu call it now?
(The scene)
Whatchu all about?
(The scene)
Whatchu call it now?
(The scene)

I go to different shows
And hear em kickin flows
And in an instant go from miserable to ‘this is dope’
The way an infant grows from the chin to the toes
From the stem to the rose
I’ve seen it all
From biblical to minimal
Fictional syllables are criminal but typical
Still I ain’t cynical
And when you hand me a flyer
Prepare to acquire one back when I unpack
Every show I’m at there’s 140 characters
Tryin to write a book with 140 characters
Tweetin on their cell phone 140 characters
Put your phone down you are witnessing a massacre
Yeah you ignore me in person but
You show me love on the internet
I hear you preachin them sermons, huh?
Keep burnin that intellect
Hey yo
Look around you
Look at what surrounds you
All the faces
And the place is
So amazing
Good gracious
Whatchu all about?
(The scene)
Whatchu call it now?
(The scene)
Whatchu all about?
(The scene)
Whatchu call it now?

Take heed, y’all
This is for the NYC, y’all
Jersey, CT
I see y’all
Down south, west coast and between, y’all
All people
Get free, y’all
Be whatever you wanna be, y’all
Eyes closed, lean back, just freefall
I know it seems wack as can be, y’all
But be all that you can be
Whether you’re Bambi or Candide
A Camry or Lamborghini, yep
Play it however you wanna play it
My vowels are on the pavement
My fouls are always flagrant
My bowels are never fragrant
I scowl at every agent
Who’s sayin we’ll never make it
We’re makin it in a basement
So blatant never complacent
Impatient my generation
Is achin for deviation
With ancient articulation
It’s radiant so we’re sayin

Hey yo
Look around you
Look at what surrounds you
All the faces
And the place is
So amazing
Good gracious
Whatchu all about?
(The scene)
Whatchu call it now?
(The scene)
Whatchu all about?
(The scene)
Whatchu call it now?
