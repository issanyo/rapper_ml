[Intro: Ryan Leslie (Jasmine V)]
Yeah, uh, uh, yeah
Heavy hangs the head that wears the crown, Les'

[Verse 1: Ryan Leslie]
They tryna break a nigga's spirit
That hate shit they talking, I ain't even tryna' hear it, nah (I'm rolling)
I'm rolling up, you see I'm on a roll
That Harvard education, homie, I been honor roll (fifteen)
I tell 'em, you see me taking off
I'm kinda' tired from the jet lag, shake it off (money)
In Vienna with my whole crew, on deck (classic)
What you talking for, homie? I write my own checks
Down for my Renegades, check my interviews
Lead singer even fucking with my interludes (real talk)
So I'll guarantee, I'mma pick up the pace
Hundred miles I'm running, y'all niggas running in place

[Hook: Jasmine V]
He who wears the crown
Never let the block or the city down
He who's on the throne
VVS cuffs and a vintage Rolls
Hear you tryna mess with his city
Hear you tryna mess with his money
He who wears the crown
He don't mess around
He'll put you down

[Verse 2: Ryan Leslie]
I'm getting high off the fumes of my Aston
Compton to Aspen, everybody asking (what?)
Who's the genius? King of new media
Don't believe everything you read on Wikipedia
Candy painted, my thoughts tainted with dark flows
God flows, convos, and condos (money)
Fast lanes, fast cars, and cash dreams
Who's that pretty little lady in them Guess jeans? (pose for me)
Oh, she looking like a winner
Take the camera out, you know I had to document her (twerk)
Take them clothes off, show me what you stand for
You rolling with a god, what you need a man for?

[Hook: Jasmine V]
He who wears the crown
Never let the block or the city down
He who's on the throne
VVS cuffs and a vintage Rolls
Hear you tryna mess with his city
Hear you tryna mess with his money
He who wears the crown
He don't mess around
He'll put you down

[Verse 3: Ryan Leslie]
I'm here to disrespect what you expect
I would never short a man who was due his debt
Yeah, they say that I'm a fraud, how true is that?
The Wall Street penthouse, what kinda' view is that?
[It'll have?] to see the crabs, crabs in the barrel
These niggas looking crooked, I'mma take the straight and narrow (yup)
On that propeller out the Rio De Janeiro
Woody Allen of rap, you can be my Mia Farrow (yeah)
Look me in my eyes, I'm never gonna apologize (no)
I see your bullshit, man, I heard a lot of lies
The road to hell is paved with some broken dreams
And being at the top ain't never what it seems

[Hook: Jasmine V]
He who wears the crown
Never let the block or the city down
He who's on the throne
VVS cuffs and a vintage Rolls
Hear you tryna mess with his city
Hear you tryna mess with his money
He who wears the crown
He don't mess around
He'll put you down

[Outro: Ryan Leslie (Jasmine V)]
Heavy is the head, cursed by the bread
I just pray to God they remember me when I'm dead
And not for what I said, but what I did
I'm just leaving a legacy for my kids
The road to hell is paved with some broken dreams
Being at the top ain't really what it seems
