[Verse 1: GreekDaGod]
O i dont think they like me fresh in my white t
Buzzing for to long to let these niggas ice me
Came back for da rings , came back for the chains
Came back for the girls, all man i make it rain
Bring it back bring back for a real nigga
Stand back stand back i don’t pull triggers
Matter fact I came just just a smooth killer
Come on im with a crew of niggas
Yall nigga kno the name they call me H
Shots that would damage your fame  u can relate
More money more money
Tell shawty to get low man im tryna ball
All i see is green in my eye i need it all
Kingkillers, k2 , u kno the theme
You dont have to be in outta space to roll with star
R.L. , J.Q. the killer crew

[Hook:GreekDaGod]

Momma told me go knock them out
It been to long no doubt
They took the keys and flew south
Ima eastside rider, where's my crown (2x)
They took the keys and flew south
It been to long no doubt
Momma told me go knock them out

[Verse 2: GreekDaGod]

Late night writing, racing against time
Mark with the dead lessees sin , dinner time
They told me go get em,  i told i got em , they broke the cage
Now they running for their life , they wish i never rose
Im trashin all feos , kill em with my killer flow , haters boost  the most
Riding coast to coast , just to smack a ho
Now they got out of my character now i gotta boost
Ride around with six chains like every day is a holiday
Cause every day is a new, so f what that shawty said
Im riding fast in that c5, u  really dont kno me T.I
It was a dream B.I., my flow leave u sea side
My flow is so raw like pornos
I pray to lord i get six boats
I pray to lord. I get more doe
Pow pow u dead, dats your promo
I got 100 flows ,man i mean a billion flows
Flow wit the holy flow ,make you see the holy ghost
Trash talking i do the most
I close eyes when i spit this flow
This is easy to me two shots free-throw’s (laugh) :)
