Pali Kamma means "Karma". This beat kind of tells the story of that. What goes around, comes around. I focused a lot on texture in this one. Some world instruments incorporated into the track, but with a boomtrap bounce to it. The thing about boomtrap is that the bounce and swing have to be right. They have to evoke emotion and urgency. I heard this vocal sample and knew I had to flip it. This was the first single and it represents the them and overall feel for BoomTrap Volume 4. This is one of my favorites
