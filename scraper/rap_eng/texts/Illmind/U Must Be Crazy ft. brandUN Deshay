[Verse 1: Ken Rebel]
Now I done fall off my pivot
Cause Kenny Rebel don't listen
But now that stays depressin'
Learnin' the essence of lessons
Living so free in this world, but I'm seeking progression
Hoping my music will spread like Magic Johnson's infection
The rebel's deeper than a mile on some inFamous shit
Fuck infection, I'm dickin' and dippin' like Trix in this bitch
