[Intro]
Les
It feels so good to fly
The view is so beautiful from up here

[Verse 1]
She told me come and get her in that white horse
Hotel menu we take the night course
Then I lay her down in a bed of roses
She parts like the red sea spread for Moses
Is that really so ridiculous?
Take my time, she say Ryan's so meticulous
Attention to every detail
I'm a god, you a goddess of a female
Now these haters screaming blasphemy
Let em talk cause these hoes never last for me
If you looking for a G, homie ask for me
I hold on to my lady cause she would blast for me
Fire shots - take a bullet too
That's why they hate us for our love man its bullet proof
In the line of fire I'mma pull her through
And when she's tired I'mma tell my baby lay down
[Hook]
Lay down (lay down)
Lay down (lay down)
I can hear you now (Let that body talk)
I can hear you now (Let that body talk)
Lay down (lay down)
Lay down (lay down)
I can hear you now (Let that body talk)
I can hear you now

[Verse 2]
I only count my wins, never count my losses
Late night G5 conversate with bosses
We travel to an exotic place
Damn right I put a smile on that exotic face
She help me through my daily regimen
Hold me down make me better than I've ever been
A superhero to these other men
They may test but they don't know what they up against
Where're my ladies that appreciate that good D?
You ain't getting that from your man, girl, you should be
Ask my exes they'll tell you the way it could be
Just keep it real baby throw me back that good V
And I'll show you the way we get along
Tell them niggas leave our shit alone
They'll be mad when they hear this song
But you'll be happy when I tell you baby lay down

[Hook]

[Bridge]
And as I lay you down to sleep
Trust me baby all your secrets I'mma keep
Be my angel, I'll be your protection
I can see my future girl in your reflection
Fly so high that it's heavenly
A better you a better me
It's better than amphetamines

[Hook]

[Outro]
Can we wait a while
Can we wait a while
Can we wait a while baby
Wait a while

If you see me walkin' down the street
If you
If you see me
Can we wait a while baby
Wait a while

I'll do what you want me to, baby

You - you deserve a king
I deserve a queen my love, my love
You deserve a king
I deserve a queen
That you are
That you are baby
