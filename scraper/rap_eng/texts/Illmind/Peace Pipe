The thing that Windy love about the dopa
It don't fuck you up like the coca (tha coca)
When I sell my weed to the people
I know I'm uplifting they life through the weed smoke
This shit helped Windy get his cheese up (cheese up)
I know this shit safer than peanuts
You can blow a whole bag in just two minutes
It's gonna make you high enough to see Jesus
I know this shit can kill cancer
It's bring folks together just like them high school dances
If you get locked up fortunately they give you more chances
If you got questions, then Windy got the answers
