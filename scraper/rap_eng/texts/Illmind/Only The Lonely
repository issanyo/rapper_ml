[Verse 1 - Ryan]
She tried to rape me with no record deal
Put my record on, I show you how good records feel
You tried to take advantage with that sex appeal
You tryna buy a track well homie that's a mil (Pay me)
Let your guard down - show me where your mind's at
Tell me where your secrets are and I'll show you where mines at
Rewind that - I'll show you where mines at
Been around the Universe and I ain't got no time left (Game over)
We playin' - we, we, we playin, girl
You speak in body language - what you sayin girl?
Venus and mars - we ain't from the same world (different)
You ain't happy here then go on do your thang girl

[Hook - Courtney]
Only the lonely can make you feel this way
Pain in my heart means I can't stay
I'll be gone in a minute - gone in a minute
My love's got a limit, yeah
Only the lonely can make you feel this way
Pain in my heart means I can't stay
I'll be gone in a minute - gone in a minute
My love's got a limit, yeah

[Verse 2 - Ryan]
I keep my paper in that paper bag (cash)
Once you take that paper bag then you can't take it back (never)
You took my heart, girl, you can't take it back (never)
Go 'head and spend that money I'mma make it back (ballin)
Back in the club - turn me to my old ways
Got my new Givenchy's on and I can't rock them old shades
Get it - I'm fly (fresh)
Homie, I'm space bound (fresh)
Ask me how I like my chicks - I like 'em face down
No disrespect (I'm zonin')
I'm in my own zone (king)
Catch me in Versace slippers in my own home (king me)
Got my gold chain (shinin')
That's how I feel good (stunt)
You don't want a nigga back you know I'm still good

[Hook - Courtney]
Only the lonely can make you feel this way
Pain in my heart means I can't stay
I'll be gone in a minute - gone in a minute
My love's got a limit, yeah
Only the lonely can make you feel this way
Pain in my heart means I can't stay
I'll be gone in a minute - gone in a minute
My love's got a limit, yeah

[Verse 3 - Ryan]
You got your problems, I got mine too
Put your lighters up and baby we gon' shine thru
I said we shine thru - baby - we gon' shine thru
Let 'em talk baby, you got me and I got you
We put that time in it, now just put our lives in it
We put that time in it, girl, I swear we not finished (you mine)

[Vamp]
And put your lighters up (up, up, up)
Put your lighters in the sky for love
