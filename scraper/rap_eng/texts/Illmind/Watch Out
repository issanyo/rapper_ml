The better the spitter
The more toxicin in the venom
Talking slick, snake eyes
Bites, and double vision
8th try, to take me out
The fights in him
He know what I'm about
But there's spite within him
So he keep on spittin'
Aim the shoots high
They spread, rumors
Feed into lies, Defeat em in one try
If i tired
But ill half ass they ass whoppin'
Out last
GED an educated outcast, pause
Who's top 10 and who's a member of the gods?
Weigh the odds, are they in ya favor?
Rockin' different flavor
Save it for now and later, hold up playa' we should know
Are you lying to your hoe?
How many times you switch your flow?
You a copy of an idol or original but
Aye
That ain't my place, i can trend across all of the states
I can transcend any race, win a race
Any pace, take my gold, purple lace
Yes I'm great you a disgrace
You ain't got money
Get the fuck up out my face

Boy they sleeping on me X2
My oh my i know (aye)
Boy the sleeping on me X2
Why oh why, i know (aye)
The jealousy is too real
They jealous of me that's how they feel boy
The jealousy is too real
They jealous of me that's how they feel

Yo
I see through it all
I'm on another call
Y'all got some butter fingers
Cause you always drop the ball
I was born a fucking star
Been shinning my whole life
Y'all talk behind my back, but yall better think twice
Before you make an enemy that you don't need
I'm shy upfront
A humble king who can always bring you to your knees
Bow down, i had the crown before you even knew about it
West Coast Funk
Stash you rappers in my trunk
I puts, on
Shouts out my Yagoo, he keep it real
I'm just trying to see who really bout it
And who only bout my skill
So how you feel?
Bars like steel, i only hunt to kill
If you ain't here now, ill see you bitches after i sign some deals
Kissing my ass, i know you love this
I'm top tier because there is no other rapper that's above this
I make the buckets
And ladies love it when i talk shit
Think different than ask yo bitch

WATCH OUT!
Im comin' for the game better
WATCH OUT!
You better know the name needa'
