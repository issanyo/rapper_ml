[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
We weren't supposed to dance this long
But our connection was just too strong
We started out in a room full of people
But now we dance the night alone
I'm not havin' fun anymore
But I can't seem to find the door
I'm not havin' fun anymore
But I can't seem to find the door

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
When these strange motions
They tell me don't get lost in heaven

[Verse 2: Willow Stephens]
Strange motions turn me into the spin
Dance me to the endin' that's about to begin
Forgettin' where we started so we just pretend
Strange motions
