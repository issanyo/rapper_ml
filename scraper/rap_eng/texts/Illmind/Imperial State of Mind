[Verse 1: Lord AV]
Rebel like Toussaint in Saint Laurent
Pushing DuPont’s off flaming lakefronts
Converting this dough to croissants
With nuance, In Paris
Embarrassed by lack of care of the cost
Aware of the perils of lux apparel on envious hearts
The air of a Pharaoh, Tutankhamen on steroids
Building blueprints my Banneker architect dreams as little boy
The need for acceptance when favoritism would be employed
Made the hunger for my respect turn to ambition for the world
Wanting them Richie rich riches & power, tempted by bitches and showered
With gifts by princes and Providences with wives and dowry
Look like two Tamara Mowry's, they say that be double the fun
Double the pleasure well my dick double-mint for them gums
I'm just trying to get golden bricks higher than Giza pyramid
Till I stumble a geezer and pass my empire to my kid
The hood that I grew up in nepotism did not exist
That shit was an urban legend, but watch me debunk the myth
Young Imperialist

[Hook 1: Lord AV]
I will take your town
I will take your crib
I will take your crown
I will take your bitch
Till I'm in the ground
That’s just how I get
Till I'm in the ground
That’s just how I live
That’s just how I live

[Verse 2: Lord AV]
Her main mane claim he know how to ball man
But bought her Balmain on train off purse hustling bald man
And on my balls, say she faithful, but me she calling
But'll let me bang get brain if I gain a lil’ rap fame
I over stand, go a lil harder than Hova then
Double back in that rover, just to bone her then go fuck her friend
I'm just the product of pain
Too naive in my younger days
Now I'm out here like hunger games
Drunk with power, let you chase, while I sing
I'm taking dykes and they girlfriends
Black Napolean
I tailpipe them hoes again
Axel Folying
What happens when you taught you a god
When you 3 years old a child
And you grow up in this wild
All I know just go hard
Genghis Khan in this bitch want it all and I don’t give a shit
I'm a god, nail your bitch to the wall, now gone and feel this dick
Till a nigga be the master I'll be scarred off in this whip
Till a nigga be the master I'll be scarred off in this whip
Bitch

[Hook 2: Lord AV]
I will take your town
I will take your crib
I will take your crown
I will take your bitch
Till I'm in the ground
That’s just how I get
Till I'm in the ground
That’s just how I live
That’s just how I live

[Verse 3: Lord AV]
Since been legal, tried to keep my mind off these bitches
Feel like Steven Segal all these fucking spines I be twisting
Have ‘em doing Kegels’ while I'm on the grind for these riches
Cause they know I'm regal, I ain't got no time to be slipping
I'm a Calipha, Sultan of high caliber
Go to war like Galaga
Crush your head like Gallagher
Battlestar Galactica
Send it up like Attica
Send me back to Africa
I'll come back more blackerer
All this crack is named after crackers
Back then bull whip crackers
Caught us lackin, now suburban whites
Getting it crack-a-lacking
Bound to happen
8 white girls off Molly clapping
Thanks to Miley re-enacting
Twerk a nigga throw it back then
Make it whistle, no open casket
Bitch

[Hook 3: Lord AV]
I will take your town
I will take your crib
I will take your crown
I will take your bitch
Till I'm in the ground
That’s just how I get
Till I'm in the ground
That’s just how I live
I will take your town
I will take your crib
I will take your crown
I will take your bitch
Till I'm in the ground
That’s just how I get
Till I'm in the ground
That’s just how I live
That’s just how it is
