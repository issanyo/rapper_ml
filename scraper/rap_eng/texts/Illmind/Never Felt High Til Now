Yeeaaahh
And I don’t think I’ll ever come down from how I’m feelin right now
Naahhhh
Head’s in the sky but my feet on the ground
Yeeaaahh
I like how that feel
I like how that sound
Y’all think I could touch the clouds?
I ain’t never felt high til now

[Verse 1: Jesse Abraham]
Hands up if you're twisted
So close to the sky that you kissed it
Your lifestyle is hedonistic
Be realistic
If you smokin some trees you ain’t a misfit
Water for the fishes
Yeah I used to get lifted
But I also used to listen to Limp Bizkit
Don't judge me
If you got the luxury of puffin trees
Grab some shrubbery and pass it to your friend and say 'twist it'
But
I ain’t fucked up
When I'm on stage
I mean I get right
But in the wrong ways
Man you could get high
But I ain’t gone blaze
Keep your haze, man
I'm high cuz my song plays
I say mic check but this ain’t a protest
No it's more like a show
Let's go

And I don’t think I’ll ever come down from how I’m feelin right now
Naahhhh

I like how that feel
I like how that sound
Y’all think I could touch the clouds?
I ain’t never felt high til now

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott, MC]
Extra extra
Read all about it
You say you be the voice of the hood but I doubt it
So I’m a be the hood CNN
You know, reporting all the things the hood seein and
I’m a rebel with a cause
Mover and a shaker
Bad little emcee
Been a trouble maker
Occupying where the vultures at
All my true school cats bring the culture back
Yeeaahhh
Now how’s that for a headline?
I get it in like I had a fuckin deadline
And I ain’t never felt hit til I saw a whole crowd of the fans with their hands to their hairline
Yeah
So salute to the fans
Hands to the crowd
Middle finger to the man
Nitty Scott
Gets high

Y’all think I could touch the clouds?
I ain’t never felt high til now

[Verse 3: Jesse Abraham]
In the beginning my opinion was that sinning wasn’t for me
My head spinning wasn’t that alluring
And I seen my friends grinnin
Makin out with girls who look like dead women
Hear the next day bout how she threw up on the bed linen
14 when my world really started morphing
“You ever watched porn in the morning on morphine?”
No
“Oh. Yo, you wanna do blow and go snorkeling?”
No thanks
I don’t wanna snort snow banks
“Look how I grow plants!
The shit is so dank!”
I know the difference between good and great
"For example?"
Hmmm, let me condomplate
The feelin that I'm feeling's exceptional, yes
So I really wanna feel it
Is that cool?
"I guess"
