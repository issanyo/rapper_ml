Transylvania in the moonlight
Superstition of the dark on your mind tonight
Held captive as a guest in my dark fortress
Watch my fangs tear your pretty skin and tell me you want it

Transylvania in the moonlight
Werewolves and scary sights, better stay inside tonight
Don't get caught x5
Stay inside x4
Crucifix round your neck tonight
Better pray you don't get caught tonight
Better pray
Better pray
Better pray
Don't get caught
Don't get caught
Don't get caught
Don't get caught
Tell me you want it

Transylvania in the moonlight
Scientist of ill repute in your room tonight
You're my victim now
Running through the halls
Of my abattoir
Terrified
Running from my avatar
Terrified terrified
