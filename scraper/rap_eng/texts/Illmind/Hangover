[Verse 1:]
I think I'm in trouble baby
How the fuck did I end up here?
Got me feeling kind of lazy
I can't even think or see clear

[Bridge:]
No, I don't know where things went wrong
How could I be so blind?
The only way to figure it out is if we could just rewind
Where were you when I needed you?
Where were you when I needed you?

[Hook:]
I think I'm hungover again
Must've been drunk off your love
I don't want to black out again
Never know where I end up
Never know where I end up
Never know where I end up

[Verse 2:]
How sick you make me
But I'm addicted to your poison
Why does your love intoxicate me?
It doesn't matter because it's awesome

[Bridge:]
No, I don't know where things went wrong
How could I be so blind?
The only way to figure it out is if we could just rewind
Where were you when I needed you?
Where were you when I needed you?

[Hook:]
I think I'm hungover again
Must've been drunk off your love
I don't want to black out again
Never know where I end up
Never know where I end up
Never know where I end up

[Break:](Instrumental)

[Outro:] x2
I think I'm hungover again
Must've been drunk off your love
I don't want to black out again
Never know where I end up
Never know where I end up
Never know where I end up
