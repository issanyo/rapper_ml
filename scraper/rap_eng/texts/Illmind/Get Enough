[Chorus: Teon Gibbs]
Said I'm on way shit
Tryna give it up
Ain't about some paper
Then I don't give a fuck
I ain't for the fake shit
That ain't really love
I ain't with the majors
No I ain't given up
Said I can't get enough
(Yeah) I ain't get enough
(Young nigga) I ain't get enough
Cause I ain't get enough
(yeah) I ain't get enough

[Verse: Teon Gibbs]
They ain't wit me
All these bitches here came wit me
Boy I really got it they ain't ready (they ain't ready)
Hot nigga propane in me damn

We all different colors no apartheid
I just quit my job I was part-time (yeah)
I'm 'bout to do it big no I got shine
(Whoa) I seen a Kelly Rowland
Bad mami wanna know if Kelly rolling
Got a man but tell me that it's over
Oh Lord say come a little closer

[Chorus: Teon Gibbs}
Said I'm on way shit
Tryna give it up
Ain't about some paper
Then I don't give a fuck
I ain't for the fake shit
That ain't really love
I ain't with the majors
No I ain't given up
Said I can't get enough
(Yeah) I ain't get enough
(Young nigga) I ain't get enough
Cause I ain't get enough

And I feel like it's fate that put me in your plans

[Chorus: Teon Gibbs}
Said I'm on way shit
Tryna give it up
