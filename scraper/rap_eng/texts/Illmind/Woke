Look

Verse 1:

Feeling ferocious
Gimme more doses
Feel as tho I am chozen
Every letter potent
Knew that I'd be poet
Knew that I'd be heroic
Knew that I'd catch the flow and I'm waking up in the morning
With that savage mind set
Yeah nigga I'm next
Just gimme the mic and I'm killing niggas progress
This ain't a contest
Don't mistake the context
Maneuver shit so easily they saying I'm blessed

So yeah

Thank god for this gift I really feel it tho
Cause when grip it I'm spitting and feeling spiritual
Chasing my dreams like I'm mario homie here we go
On top of that my dna is a miracle

I never saw my ability
Then realized I'm a poet with unlimited energy
And have you ever noticed that my team got the synergy
Recognized it now we got ridiculous chemistry
They giving me

All that I need to excel
And if I try my hardest know I'm never gonna fail
Be a creative artist do you know what that entails?
And there ain't no way to stop it when my mind sets sail
Yeah I find this chill

No one can stop the man
Figured out how to do it then I took it and I ran
And if I gotta prove it I'll show you the man can
Reintroduce myself as the king of the damn land

Here's what I can't stand

It ain't about the money nah it's deeper
I want the world to know when Vonte hop up on a feature
They'll listen to the flow and be stuck in a mild seizure
And then I go pro with the lense of a wild eagle
I'm not eager
I stay cool
And when I fuckin make it I swear that I'll stay true
I'll never be a fake and that's word to Jesus
I love speaking my mind and I'm willing to pay dues

In my mind you will find
That I'm hardly ever
Thinking about the time nigga it's stormy weather
I'm in a bind on my grind and I'm awfully clever
But believe me when I say that I been strong forever

And with my.......pencil in hand
Never missing a chance
Create these images in a way that you'll understand

From my brain comes a wave of knowledge in advance
And even tho I never finished college here's the plan

Imma take over the world with my words and my past
Defeat the evil as it keeps emerging in the path
I didn't mean to be the illest nigga with the craft
I'm rollin with it though so lemme have it while it lasts

But here's the thing I'm never losing the grip
And yeah we all got a choice and so I'm choosing to spit
So imma leave it to the gift and let it boost me to win
And yeah I'm nasty with a pen and yet I proved it again
And again and again and again
Man I'm nasty as hell
Imma surpass every artist that's including adele
Every time I do this man I swear to god I excel
And I'm ready for success but also ready to fail

Cause what the fuck is failure without no valuable lesson
The world is wet sement and imma leave an impression
I believe that I was sent to be a powerful message
To every person on this earth that need a sense of direction

So I'm here to tell you now lemme infiltrate
All of your thoughts and your heart lemme demonstrate
How to pick a mind apart using my inner state
And I ain't sleep homie you should know I been awake
