[Verse 1]
Outside still smelling like where the winners at
Look at all these empires under these fitted hats
Look at the grills on the cars we could be leaning on
Now look at all these unmarked cars that's grilling back
Fuck, how real is that? How real it is
All of us is just pictures of what the city did
The city made us to keep it the way you see it though
Or be alone when the world say what the city is
And we is who we say we is, you know us well
Part nerd, part grind like I know Pharrell
Frenzies outside, don't ever slow the deal
No circulars here you can't hold a sale, for real
Lo sweats and aqua 8s
Blew through the caution as long as you got a plate
Fruits of the labor whoever should want a taste
Swear we heard it all yo, everything they would say, all of it tho'

[Hook]
Everything's for sale
Told us 5 passports
And we never going to jail
So we working on the 2nd
And the 3rd and the 4th and the 5th
Til it clicks like everything is for real
For real

[Verse 2]
Six degrees from whoever you need to get you yours
And tryna get it is everything they applaud
Applause come by the doubles in double R's
The rhythm of it is trusting in the facade
Of an 80 thou' genie but it's flyer than Lashonte
Tinted up, me and mine hiding like I'm Wanya
Role players rather stand around til your part change, out for your cast, everybody
On they Andre, right?
But we the products of seeing product and comprehending
You see a bottle, you see a model, you compliment it
Early morning on that Mourning off a hard block
Calling Zo season tryna make a couple cards pop
Pop! Like when you sitting in your living room
And you can hear pop! on the daily til it's typical
Tying up the motives like my double entendres
Until my friends can tell you that I LeBron'ed them

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
As real as they told us to be when the lights get to us
Like do it right and them fluorescents might stick to us
Star gazed like "see them and picture us"
The top flies off the Veuve and you steal the rush
Cause me and A' was going half on a hero while we'd pass by the heroes
Added how they had it then we passed by them heroes, elevator awe
Kills us to show them what a respirator's for
But all of us came up hearing everything's for sale
