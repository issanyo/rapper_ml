[Intro]
Someone is always doing what someone else said could not be done

[Hook:]
Ayo, I'm fed up, fed up with the bullshit
Artists are bullshit, Industry bullshit
I put my time and energy in all this bullshit
And the return on my investment is bullshit

[Verse 1: Anyextee]
So it's time to turn the tables and invest in myself
Im the C-E-O, I put myself on the shelf
Take your shit off, make sure it never sells
You inconsiderate shits are bad for my health
Cease and desist, the reason is this
Your thievery emits plots of deviousness
I been had my money right, shits straight dick face
Built Amalgam Digital off hustlin' Mixtapes
You never walked in my shoes
Put yourself in my position, I don't expect you to listen
This is for the risk taker, the entrepreneur
The big chip makers chillin' on the top floors
From play writes behind the scenes to young hustlers
Without us You ain't nuffin you ungrateful muthafuckers


[Hook:]
Ayo, I'm fed up, I'm fed up with the bullshit
Artists are bullshit, industry bullshit
I put my time and energy in all this bullshit
And the return on my investment is fuck you

[Verse 2: Anyextee]
Now, I see you like shittin' where your eatin'
You spoiled lil' brats need to stop, look, and reason
You think its talent alone that brings you success?
Without the proper management you will not touch checks
You will not touch cash, You won't become blessed
You'll be the same baby clutching on your mom's breast
I'm the voice of the labels in the industry
The same voice against the standard of the labels in the industry
Speak the truth, I'm nobodies puppet
From A&Rs, executives, sponsorships, publishing
Big wigs, to majors, your not even a player
Who can save you from the reality that Anyextee makes paper?
The paper trail of my existence is write off
Now take your ass to bed and don't forget to shut the lights off

[Hook:]
Ayo, I'm fed up, I'm fed up with the bullshit
Artists are bullshit, industry bullshit
I put my time and energy in all this bullshit
And the return on my investment is fuck you
