[Intro]
I been locked in my bedroom for months on end
I don’t really mind though cause I’m on ten
I been going in so I know something’s gotta give
I been doing my thing so I’m ignoring my friends

[Verse]
I don’t know what to say
But get the fuck out my way
I work hard every day
And I know that’s gonna pay off
Preseason but I’m going in and treating every game like the playoffs
I don’t ever take a day off
So I’ll do things that they can not
Every thing that I want
I just see that at the top
They wanna see me falling off
I don’t give a fuck at all
I been going up an awful lot
I been feeling like a god
I been feeling so phenomenal
And lately that’s been kinda hard so

[Pre-Chorus]
I been locked in my bedroom for months on end
I don’t really mind though cause I’m on ten
I been going in so I know something’s gotta give
I been doing my thing so I’m ignoring my friends but

[Chorus]
Thank you, thank you
I just wanna say thank you, thank you
Everything that I do, I do
I couldn’t do this without you, without you
Thank you, thank you
I just wanna say thank you, thank you
Everything that I do, I do
I couldn’t do this without you, without you

[Verse]
Thanks a lot for making me who I am
Thanks a lot for making me feel like shit
Thanks so much telling me that I can’t
Thanks to you I’m really boutta go get rich
777 I’m boutta go hit the jackpot
Everyday I bury myself inside a laptop
Making all these beats and I’m trying to make these raps hot
Investing in my Future and I’m tryna take my mask off so

[Pre-Chorus]
I been locked in my bedroom for months on end
I don’t really mind though cause I’m on ten
I been going in so I know something’s gotta give
I been doing my thing so I’m ignoring my friends but

[Chorus]
Thank you, thank you
I just wanna say thank you, thank you
Everything that I do, I do
I couldn’t do this without you, without you
Thank you, thank you
I just wanna say thank you, thank you
Everything that I do, I do
I couldn’t do this without you, without you
