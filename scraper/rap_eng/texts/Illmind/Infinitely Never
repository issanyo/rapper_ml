[Verse 1: Rossi]
The preconceived notion that things can last eternally
Has yearningly
Got my soul questioning discerningly
As if we live forever shadowed by the just uncertainty
It certainly seems that situations don't work out to be
Just what they seemed or what they looked on the fucking surface
If everything is temporary then i see no purpose
To make commitments if nothing ever lasts
Evolving personalities, the old you's in the past
And it casts
A dark tint over the thought
Of lasting forever, cause that's obviously not
At all possible
Like bro lets not pretend
Even one day the world's gonna fucking end, so

[Hook 1: Rossi]
Infinitely Never
Because nothing lasts forever
Tis' why I draw lines
Through all infinity signs
Because the trials and times
Made me realize
People expect to live life based off a lie X2

[Bridge 1: Rossi]
Not one thing, I've ever seen last
Welcome to forever, but forevers in the past
And I've always been one to die young, and live fast
I got a James Dean mindset before he fucking crashed X2

[Verse 2: Rossi]
Time constraints disallow me to try to wait
Denying fate, in the face of large debate
But they conjugate, having plans to actuate
But the time they waste, thinking thoughts that lead to hate
And I can't relate, feeling distant trapped inside
Cause without death there'd be no need to be alive
What's to strive for
Better yet what's to die for
Thinking what's to be alive for
So this is what i get high for
