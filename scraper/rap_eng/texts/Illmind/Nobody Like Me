[Intro: Big Pooh]
Yeah, it's ya boy man
Illmind on production of course
I got my nigga O-Dash with me tonight
I got Phonte in the house with me tonight
I got my nigga Young Krysis on the boards
D-Brock I see ya in the back baby
But check it out yo

[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]
Uh, I got my headphones steady
And you are not ready, cause the flows too heavy
Pooh be navigate over tracks like Mario Andretti
I'm sharp as a machete, you tossin the confetti
Go against me that's doors on a Chevy
64' Dishin, niggas still pitchin
Sittin' in the kitchen banging on moms table
The rap Clarke Gable
I'm kinda fly with it
I was blessed with the talent to rhyme
And motherfuckers I'm a die with it
Taking yall in the high with it
It's my shit from the captain you wanna take a ride in it?
I'm the truth when I step in the booth
AKA a hundred proof raps gasoline
Americas nightmare, but a black mans dream
My eyes on the prize no sacrfic-ing
That's how we do it man, yeah

[Hook: Darien Brockington & Rapper Big Pooh]
(Ain't nobody like me)
Tryin to be hot like me ya'll niggas keep trying
But you not like me
Never, D-Brok tell 'em man
(Ain't nobody like me)
All day they trying to walk wit' it
But there's only one Pooh one true authentic
Uh!

[Verse 2: Phonte]
It's been 5 long years since we started this
Group that was targeted
To people so annoyed with fads
And them wannabe niggas and they gorgeous past
Who ask me if I changed, fuck man, of course I have
Cause I got more records to sell
More dollars to clock, I hate it but that's how it's gotta be
Got more stories to tell, more people to watch
And ten times more people watching me
So fuck the masquerade, just let me have a say
I still be spittin' regardless of the accolades
Ya'll can take back the mics in The Source
Take back the props from Pete Rock Quest and them boys
Take back the night we did "Speed" at 4 in the mornin'
Even take back the day I met 9th in the dorm
Ya'll can re-write the history to settle the score
And I still be writing wizardry like never before
Cause I broke down this year almost lost my clarity
Felt weak at times needed God to carry me
Like, when I found success but lost me family
In the process I will not let you bastards handle me
Looking for some guidance, so I figured
I pray to god, and he said Tigga-lo
I ain't let you run it back this far
Just so you can go and fumble on the one nigga
Hahaha, what he sayin dog for real

[Hook: Phonte & Darien Brockington]
(Ain't nobody like me)
Tryin to be hot like me ya'll niggas keep trying
But you not like me, uh
Yo, you better tell 'em dog
(Ain't nobody like me)
All day they trying to walk wit' it
But there's only one Tay one true authentic
What!

O-Dash, where you at man, c'mon

[Verse 3: O-Dash]
Keep thinking shit gravy man
I heavy man, bet you all a dollar
I can change the game
Ain't gotta change the name just change the aim
For months we gon' have to rearrange ya frame
Stay strapped on the hip, for those wanna trip
Cause I got fresh feet on the whip
Man gimmie a half I'm like Dominique Dawes on the flip
No respect when I'm clutching ya grip
Paranoia sets in, thinkin 'bout the time you investin'
Could be gone in a second, that's life in perspective
Ya ace froze, case closed, leave ya body found up in Texas
No witnesses to see who that is
That's how I handle my biz, yup for sho'
Might kidnap your broad in exchange for dough, hah
You know how it go

[Hook: O-Dash & Darien Brockington]
(Ain't nobody like me)
Tryin to be hot like me ya'll niggas keep trying
But you not like me
(Ain't nobody like me)
All day they trying to walk wit' it
But there's only one O one true authentic
Yup!

[Darien Brockington]
Ohhh yeah
Ain't nobody like me
