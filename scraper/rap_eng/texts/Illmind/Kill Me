[Intro]
Feel my pain, yo I got an addiction
She's a drug she be all in my system
Sort of like a fiend when we fuck be blowing and sniffing
And all I really need's a prescription

[Verse 1]
If she's weed I can't smoke enough
She's like heroine and sex man, she's dope as fuck
And I ain't getting any better here
I'm still sick with illness, kill me cause everything will be forever clear
Ever since the pain I can never bare
I'm loosing my brain but she gives it to me everywhere

[Hook]
I'm addicted baby, so why don't you kill me?
You're a sickness baby, but I need you to heal me
I can take this no more, I've been having withdrawal
I've been feeling so alone, so I need you to kill me, kill me
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up

[Verse 2]
She's like crack and I finally hit
There's chocolate up and have sex in the kitchen
Living in this ecstasy we be rolling and tripping
Bitch you be getting me lifted
Blacked out and we up in the bed
We ain't rubbing, we ain't touching, we just bumping instead
When we done with the sex, I be fucking her friend
Cause Mary Jane and Miley lay together again
This is a game that will never end
I'm loosing my head but she gives it to me everywhere

[Hook]
I'm addicted baby, so why don't you kill me?
You're a sickness baby, but I need you to heal me
I can take this no more, I've been having withdrawal
I've been feeling so alone, so I need you to kill me, kill me
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
Throw your hands up, throw your hands up
