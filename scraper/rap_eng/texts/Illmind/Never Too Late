[Intro]
Once upon a time I had a big ole dream
So we took the city with a big ole team
Mama told me, "Baby it ain't what it seems
Just because you got a lot of green"
I go crazy, I go loco with the knowledge
Stack it up and then go 10 percent deposits
Plus I thought them folks was staying on ten
Boy I thought them folks was staying on ten

[Hook]
And I thought them folks would never go 'head
Same ones tryna celebrate
Gotta keep some food on my plate
Never too late
And I thought them folks would never go 'head
Same ones tryna celebrate
Gotta keep some food on my plate
Never too late

[Verse 1]
Coming through, we just making moves
Got a lot to prove
They gon' feel it real smooth, solid with the groove
I'm stomping on the turf like I'm Bigfoot
Boy, I bet you couldn't walk a mile in my shoes
Dodgin' all these haters with the Milly Rock
We just want the tippy top
I remember days with the zippy lock
Plus I thought them folks was staying on ten
Thought them folks was staying 'til the end

[Hook]
And I thought them folks would never go 'head
Same ones tryna celebrate
Gotta keep some food on my plate
Never too late
And I thought them folks would never go 'head
Same ones tryna celebrate
Gotta keep some food on my plate
Never too late

[Verse 2]
I'm at home plate, fresh up out the dugout
One time for my brothers still posted in the dugout
Home run hitter, boy we outta here for real
I just played what I was dealt
Now I got a deal
Eating up my problems, got a stomach full of struggle
But I knew we was winning as soon as I left the huddle
Plus I thought them folks was staying on ten
Thought them folks was staying 'til the end

[Hook]
And I thought them folks would never go 'head
Same ones tryna celebrate
Gotta keep some food on my plate
Never too late
And I thought them folks would never go 'head
Same ones tryna celebrate
Gotta keep some food on my plate
Never too late

[Outro]
Had to wait to find the whole way
Never too late
Never too, never too late
Never too late
Had to wait to find the whole way
Never too late
Never too, never too late
Never too late
