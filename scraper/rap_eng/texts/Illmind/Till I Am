I heard the
Sky went dark
Fire went cold
When they lost their spark
I heard the rivers froze over and they lost their ark
Girl don't tempt me just play your part

I'll play god till I am one

Smile for the cameras
Make a hundred grand offs stanzas
Stand up for it



Let me be the answer for banter
Bucket of bank rolls they bag for the cameras

Who really real if the world a stage
And how you really love if it's bringing you pain
A couple of things you can't change
Till they're loving your name

Your Gold chains are still chains
Man they're one and the same
I need change in exchange
Lord bring on the rain
They identities nicknames
They're afraid of the fame
They can't follow our footprints
They all been erased
It's just part of the game

Man it's all in a daze
And I been in it for days now
It sure looked good thinking back to the playground
I told you that I would
And there ain't shit you can say now
Looking back
Looking back
Prolly wouldn't choose a different path
Where the hook attach
Better look up fast
This a shot in the dark
Where book of matches at
I just kicked the flask
While the whole worlds looking
I'll be what the whole worlds looking at
Believe that

Profit on the d lo
Product getting delayed
Fighting getting destroyed
Something like is d day
Love me like a local
Knew that I would be great
They dislike when I walk in
I don't really see hate
Smile when I see them
But I don't think they see great
Feel like it's my b day
But I don't really eat cake
Balling put me on a cover up at ea
Running relays
Too fly I need a pj
Put the wheels up
Real stuff
Never be fake
Working thru the nights no sleep
On these week days
No week ends off
Only weak pay

I need to double up
On a cheap skate
