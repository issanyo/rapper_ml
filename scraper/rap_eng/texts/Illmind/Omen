Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen
I like black Timbs and black hoodies
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen
I like black Timbs and black hoodies

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
I'mma pull up in that matte black ooh
All the pieces on my skin black ink, all black tattoos
Shorty bendin’ like a black cat do
Black hoodie, all black Timb boots
You could get your ass stomped on the black top
Runnin' in the middle of black tie parties just like we black ops
Well I'm all bout black flag, I’m Black Sabbath
They wanna black ball I but they gonna need black magic
‘Cause I b-b-b-black out on these back stabbers
‘Cause I am black tar heroin to a crack addict
In black APCs and shop black jackets
And now we don't leave Barneys until they black bag it up
Hold up, now my heart black and my leather black
Gotta wipe they memory clean just like the men in black
I fuck suicide girls, bumpin' the Black Keys
Say hello to the black sheep, I told you I'm…

Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen

[Verse Two: Jarren Benton]
Yeah, I'm dressed in all black like Huey be
Hop out the elevator, stick a shank in your Louis V
Ain't nothin' new to me, aye who the fuck are you foolin' b?
Still kill a mic, then make you run out your jewelry
Not in a mood to be fucked with, I beat you brutally
I’m usually calm but I’m sick of these niggas' buffoonery
I come to your wake and ruin your eulogy
Nothin’ you could do to me, please put me out my misery
Bitch, I'm out in Italy with Tiffany gettin' head consistently
R.I.P. if you insist on dissin' me
Allergic to the bullshit, hand me an antihistamine
Used to take sips of lean, hot, I’m sizzlin'
Give these bitches cock in a limousine
Jealousy and greed go kill a teen
Put a nigga's head in a guillotine
I like my bit ‘cause ya all actin' really slow
Dressed in all black when I kick your fuckin' door with Emilio

[Refrain]
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen
I like black Timbs and black hoodies
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen
Dressed in all black like The Omen
I like black Timbs and black hoodies

[Verse Three: Hi-Rez]
I'm wreckin' the second I'm steppin' over, can't mez in depression
Only thing left is to conquer all those who step in my presence
Swear that I'm gon die a legend, verses I'm spittin' like reverends
All of the idols you idolizin' are fuckin' pathetic
Sicker than syphilis, I have cognitive dissonance
I get lost in the midst of the women, drugs and the liquor
I feel like I'm Bradley Cooper, consumin' pills out of Limitless
Swear I used to be innocent, now I'm leanin' towards villainous
The friend of my enemy is probably my enemy
When I step in the room, you could feel the change in energy
I got bars that'll knock you out like overdose on canopy
My records dope, put ‘em with the bath salts and amphetamine
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven with the goodie goodies
Dressed in white, I like black chucks and black hoodies
I just reached the verdict for these haters like a damn jury
I give no fucks, I'm comin' back with damn fury, Rez
