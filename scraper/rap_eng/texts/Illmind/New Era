[Verse 1]
7 and a half Yank New Era
Spank whoever feel like their knuckle game do better
Bitches try to bag me, I never chase pussy
And we could never be family, I don't relate, pussy
I still hop off trains then hop on planes, yeah every single state book me
Word to my chain, a nigga ain't book me
Learn the name, rookie
Ayo, I think my new AK's JO
Everything I rhyme cook yayo
I grew up on the opposite side, I'm not you
My niggas brought them choppers outside for Fox News
[Knock on the door, Rasta's inside, the pot move
Roll up an L of chocolate Thai and cop booze
Me and Twon play Monopoly, my property gone
I lost him before I knew how to properly mourn
I do my rappin' nowadays in apology form
Like I'm sorry, that shit that you're rockin', that's not what we're on

[Hook]
7 and a half Yank New Era
It's real underneath this 7 and a half Yank New Era
7 and a half Yank New Era
It's all real underneath this 7 and a half Yank New Era

[Verse 2]
Mama ain't ever raise no fool or no sucka
Escape from who? You've never been a threat
You pillow talk with birds and hover over green like vinaigrette
Suck another nigga's dick to get a check
I check in hotels, kick off my checks and have disrespectful sex
That whip breakin' your neck, I coulda bought it, I don't want it
And just cause son got it don't mean that he could afford it
Lot of smoke and mirrors, feel like I'm walkin' all through a haunted house
First nigga jump out, I'ma drop him, y'all can record it
I stay camera ready, cause I don't change for the cameras, ready?
Now watch me go pro on these amateurs
Hand steady, I race against Andretti
And 9.6 volt remote control cars with old Eveready
I'm too mothafuckin' grown, y'all too mothafuckin' petty
Y'all worried 'bout Barneys, I'm upstairs fuckin' Betty
Think I lie through raps? Get smacked, boy I combine two hats
The nigga under this fitted'll snap

[Hook]
7 and a half Yank New Era
It's real underneath this 7 and a half Yank New Era
7 and a half Yank New Era
It's all real underneath this 7 and a half Yank New Era
