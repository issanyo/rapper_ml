[Verse One: Emilio Rojas/Raks One]
Push the levels to the blood red
I got a style so live that when it comes my time, it's gon' be undead
I run with track stars coming off the bat hard
With a team of heavy hitters from the sandlots to backyards
Act hard but money still don't try me
Cause I fucking hate rap, they call me Bill O'Riley
I'm ill with timing
Pass, leaving gassed rappers assed out
A sinner that'll cast the first stone at a glass house
I got a bad mouth of solid gold
But yo it's powerful enough to tip Stone Henge like dominoes
That's how it goes if you messing with me
My bloods boiling, it's natural I'm letting off steam
My method of speech is villainous but I'm only killing time
I'm iller than cats that's rapped longer than I've been alive
So I'm gon' strike while the iron is hot
And pull your heart strings to leave your stomach tied up in knots
I'm caustic
Venomous in every bar spit
Putting rappers outta they day job like Rawkus
Y'all cats talking?
Trust I'm gon' get you
Keep spilling your guts, I'll mop the floor with you
You're horrible, with no style
My flow's bile, I'm disgusting man, I'm so vile
A known tyrant, I say it raw
Plus, touched so many of y'all I gotta register for Megan's Law

[Supastition]
Now a days you got a hand full of rappers who talk trash
On record, but they quite every time that you walk past
But I don't care about battling on wax or Pro Tools
I'm old school but I will approach you
And Supa's no punk
Try scaring him
You stand a better change of Lil' Jon leaving rap and becoming a librarian
Then, seeing a drop a fear and still in me
I done killed enemies worse the way that they killed Kennedy
I'll shit on your name, assassinate your character
Drag your name through the mud, whatever it takes to bury ya
There's no comparing us
I'm the illest in the streets and you can't even compete
With niggas in ya area
Prepare for the takeover
Me and my crew full of goons
Get talked about more than 50 Cent bullet wounds
Ironically, a few years back, no one would mention me
Now I'm praised with the flow of the century
Uh, you think you raw, someone in his camp lied to him
Bring your favorite rapper, I'll make an example outta him
Me and sicker raps will run laps around y'all cats
Fall back like you got smacked with a baseball bat
I spit raw raps at a legendary caliber
The voice and the flow is a threat to every challenger
I'm Supastition, you don't wanna test the S what?!
I'm done with it, run with it if you next up
