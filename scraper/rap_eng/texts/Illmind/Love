[Intro]
What we got if we don't got (love, love, love)
What we got if we don't got (love, love, love)
What we got if we don't got (love)

[Verse 1]
Sorry to keep y'all waitin'
Album was supposed to drop, I had a situation
Me and this fine thing started datin'
I spit game, but I wasn't playin'
I threw a ring on it, found (love) ah
Should've seen the celebration
20k in savings, yeah, that's some preparation
Suit was handmade, 5,001 flavors
Fallin' in love is easy, buildin' it takes patience
That's (love)
Man, that covenant commitment
Not the type that's lookin' like a business
On some, I give you what you need just to get what I need
So when I'm givin' it to you, I'm really givin' to me
That's not (love)
I'm talkin' 'bout the real stuff
That kind that make you vulnerable and reveal stuff
That kinda dealin' with your pastor, get healed stuff
Fellas say they real tough, but nothin' braver than (love)
Love, yeah

[Hook 1]
Yo, what we got if we don't got (love)
Everybody searchin' for
And everybody need that love
(Love, love, love)
And nothin' more timeless than (love, love)
Two-steppin' in the name of (love)

[Verse 2]
It's no word more abused than "you"
Sometimes I be gettin' lust confused for you
Watch a man real close, what he choose to do with his money
That'll tell you the truth about what he really (love)
Ayo, you're more than just a feelin'
You're more like an action, more like a decision
You listen even when somebody think different
Don't insist on gettin' your own way, that's no way to (love) ah
Cause of you I told my boy he was trippin'
Even though I knew it bring friction
I tell the truth without you around, nobody listen
Yo, how you celebrate a blessin' when you ain't get it, that's (love)
You motivate my whole mission
When I think about God, you the definition
Yo, why I never see you hang with the religious?
I feel you when you know I'm forgiven
I, I, I love (love)
You been so gracious and been so patient
You don't throw them past mistakes up in my face
You remind me no matter the skin we one race
If you had a daughter, I bet her name would be Grace
Cause you're (love, love, love)
You're love

[Hook 2]
Yo, what we got if we don't got (love, love, love)
And everybody searchin' for (love)
And everybody need that (love)
Yeah, cause nothin' more timeless than
Two-steppin' in the name of
What we got if we don't got
Love
