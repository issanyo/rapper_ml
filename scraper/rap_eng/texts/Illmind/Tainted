[Hook]
I wonder where my place is
But I won’t choose a side
So tell me where do I stand
They said that we got tainted but fuck you
That’s why I’m the way that I am
I wonder where my place is
But I won’t choose a side
So tell me where do I stand
They said that we got tainted but fuck you
That’s why I’m the way that I am
I’m the way that I am, I’m the way that I am
I’m the way that I am, I’m the way that I
I’m the way that I, I’m the way that I am
I’m the way that I am, I’m the way that I am
I’m the way that I am, I’m the way that I…

[Verse One]
They told my mom to fuck her own kind
Go and find somebody white
A white man that’ll love and treat you right
A white man that ain’t gonna need a wife
Just to make sure his paperwork right
They said my father was a fuckin’ spic
And the thought of it disgusted them
Like how the hell’d you fall in love with him?
God forbid y’all gon’ have a couple kids
Better hope that god forgive what you done to them
They like, “Emilio, where you gonna fit?”
High school lunch room, where you gonna sit now?
They told my mama if he gonna speak Spanish
Better keep his dirty ass up in the crib, right
That’s just how it is, right?
In a small city full of small minds
Growin’ up in an American apartheid
And then my mama used to tell me it’ll be alright
And then I hear her cryin’ all night like damn

I’m the way that I am, I’m the way that I am
I’m the way that I am, I’m the way that I
I’m the way that I, I’m the way that I am…

[Verse Two]
What’s the expectation for Hispanic males?
They say we gettin’ women pregnant or stayin’ in jail
They told us we supposed to be the plug
We supposed to be the kingpin on boats that’s filled with drugs
We supposed to be the ones that sellin’ cocaine or sellin’ crack
Who got our daughters at the border with orders
We been to hell to back
Out chasin’ ass, not takin’ care of our fam
With aliens up in the crib like it’s American Dad
Wanna hoard us up till the border’s shut
And exploit our women, use our daughters for they lust
And they caught them immigrants, don’t see no laws as just
But they wanna pimp us just to save a couple bucks
And they keep us workin’ class, less than a minimum wage servancin’
Our women visitin’ surgeons to get the perfect ass
They got ‘em thinkin’ that bein’ vixens’ the only path
To get somebody to love ‘em or get that Birkin bag
I got a letter from a girl who about to graduate
She got straight A’s and told me she can’t get financial aid
‘Cause both her parents is illegal
They brought her when she was two
And she still ain’t got our freedoms
But she can join the army and enlist in it
So basically she can die for this country but she can’t live in it
While we globalizin’ the third world and we cripple it
We runnin’ round like we the victims, the shit is sickenin’
