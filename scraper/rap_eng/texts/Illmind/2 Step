[Verse 1]
It’s the brown demon relax
Off 3 xanax, had to relapse
And I’m turned up with my nina
4 perks and my body bleeding
Diamonds dancing on my wrist like a stripper
Bitch money’s gleamin
Compressing finessin' xans all my life
That shit was no reason (ay)
Fuck up out my way
I feel possessed and in a maze
And if I’m dancing with the devil
Hold me tight and then we straight
Black plague running through my fucking veins
And these niggas sleepin’ on me
But get mad cuz a young nigga paid
I ain’t with that bitchin' listen
I fuck up the pot
I'm Betty Crocker in the kitchen
And if this gets disrespectful Rich Life
Comin’ through the building
I’mma swing up on that pussy
Boy I’m A-Rod with that ridged
Money long just like Rapunzel hair
Watch me grip her fuck her deep
Future Trunk up in that bitch
I’m cutting shit like it’s Freeza
Hold up, fuck nigga, test it
He ain’t makin’ it to the next sequel
Hold up, fuck nigga, test it
He ain’t makin’ it to the next sequel
Future trunks up in that bitch boy
I’m cutting shit like it’s
