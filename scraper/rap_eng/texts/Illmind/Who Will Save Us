Ahh, the last track on the EP. This one is emotional. The whole premise of this one is built off of emotion. It kind of still has a dark tone to it. Like, it's not all good. We might not know all of the answers. Definitely a creepy question mark of a statement. Who will save us? We don't know. I don't know. Do we need saving? From who? For what? A lot of unanswered questions, but I do think that there is light at the end of the tunnel if you can find it. That's what the outro represents
