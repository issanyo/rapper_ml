[Verse 1 - Skyzoo]
The life of Kings and everything we call it
The realization of everything that we forfeit
The last scene of the night, with no applaudin
Tryin to circle back to when the curtains were called in
I talk to you, cause you told me to throw my all in
And now it feels like I'm too far in
Told me regardless, as long as I could show you where the heart is
Another day shouldn't be a problem
But now the more I come to you, the more it feel like, real life
Couldn't of been built right, you told me to still write
Said that you would help me make sense of it all
And we would never have to censor our talks
So I told you everything, I never worried about if you could hear
I assumed your attention was a sign of how you cared
See with you, I was different, I ain't try to hide fear
Nor anger, nor excitement
Played you my life as, quick as I was livin it
Gave you my life as, quick as I could give you it
And never had a second thought
Hopin is for the better and forever more
I put you in front of everyone around me
From the first moment that you found me
BFF, I fell for it, by far I fell
And you was the help for it that I would call myself
So if your ears are off or tainted in the least
Then how can I explain this to me?

[Hook - Skyzoo]
So now I'm like - dear whoever
When I put this together
I felt like severin ties, may work better
I felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Could be the best thing for the both of us, forever

Dear whoever
When I put this together
I felt like severin ties, may work better
I felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Could be the best thing for the both of us, forever
Forever, forever

[Verse 2 - Skyzoo]
In all honesty, plannin on how to leave
Is just more proof of the fact that I'm all out of me
Just more truth that exactly the way I tried to be
Was either too much or not enough
No middle ground, so to talk to you and pen it down
Is not as easy no more, I think different now
The idea of tellin you what I wouldn't repeat
Only for you to be wrong is what I couldn't believe
Ran to you anytime I was lookin for me
And I took your advice on how to carry it
No barriers, no doubtin you
Until doubt was the only thing I knew how to do
When the doors close on me, day ones fold on me
You would get a hold of me and tell me to word it
But shit is gettin old on me, shit is monotone homie
Same metronome homie, I already heard it
Same metronome homie, I already heard it
Feelin like everyone before me who support me
Is deservin of a reason to applaud me
And if I ain't able to give 'em that much
Due to how we matched up
I could of scripted out a different story
I threw all caution to the wind, when you told me it was worth it
And pictured that the picture would be perfect
At the end of the day, dear notebook, thanks for all the listens
But we should probably both stop pretendin

[Hook]

[Outro - Skyzoo - talking]
Dear whoever, dear whoever, dear whoever
When I put this together
Felt like severin ties, may work better
Felt like steppin aside, instead of together
Be the best thing for the both of us, forever
