[Verse One] [8thW1]:
Peace of mind's the only thing worth killin' for
Exhaust all options, be sure that there isn't more
It's the closest we can get to Heaven in this lifetime
A quiet mind in an energized corpse
My homeboy gettin' closer to Christ
Studyin' the Gospel at first I was hostile
"Religion's all bullshit, why do you try?"
With bags under his eyes he said, "Man I got to
And if it's not true it's only through my view."
So I well wished him and offered my assistance
Who am I to tell that man how to sleep
I'm an MC, not a posturepedic physician
Cause I don't got the answers my damn self
Insanity and genius, I'm straddlin' the boarder
Like indecisive immigrants already missin' home
But what could be, to not see would be torture
Forwards the only way to move
We backslide, but don't let them record you
And if so, own up
Don't let 'em have your pride like, "Ooow, ah ha, look man I got you."
Guilt, exercise through, tryin' to deny you with hopes to demise you
So if it's the Bible or the Koran that keep you from killin' a moron, I got you

[Chorus] [8thW1]:
We all here for survival
The life you live is the ultimate trial
I ain't sayin' it's not your world
Just remember that it's mine too
And you can't hide, it's gon' find you
And you can't front, it's behind you
I ain't sayin' it's not your world
But just remember that it's mine too

[Verse Two] [Fresh Daily]:
They say they want peace so bad they'll make war for it
If that made sense to you then I'm all for it
If you like me, you see the flaw in the logic
Not the needle in the hay, don't squint, it's mad obvious
Terror situation is preposterous
Niggas dyin' on the front line is so monstrous
All that for oil, now look at the consequence
Holler at your Congress
They holler back, it's all nonsense
T.V. be soundin' like gibberish
Play a CD and they soundin' so niggerish
Somethin' kinda fishy like clitoris
Medicine lyin' in bed with big businesses
Can't tell the difference between the cure and the sicknesses
Side effects worse than the shit you gettin' rid of it's ridiculous
I ain't never claim to be deep in the politics
I can see plain you tryin' to feed me a pile of shit

[Chorus] [8thW1]:
We all here for survival
The life you live is the ultimate trial
I ain't sayin' it's not your world
But just remember that it's mine too
And you can't hide, it's gon' find you
And you can't front, it's behind you
I ain't sayin' it's not your world
But just remember that it's mine too

[Verse Three] [Silent Knight]:
Peace God
Hotem shalam
Asalamalakum, walaikum salam
That's just, a few examples of ways to respond
But we, loose track and run away from the bomb
We got, more in common then we're led to believe
But hate mongers, go around and spread a disease
We stay in conflict, "He said he was better than me?
Okay, watch then. He gonna regret that speech."
I've been in constant, jeopardy since I can remember each
Year that passed by, still lost as ever
Meanwhile, lookin' better he's a Yogi
Last has Islam and Moseir caught the ghost
Monique whole fam know they plan
That don't mean it work for me cause it work for them
I can't search for Zen, I let it find me
And finally be the change that I wanna see
See

[Chorus] [8thW1]:
We all here for survival
The life you live is the ultimate trial
I ain't sayin' it's not your world
Just remember that it's mine too
And you can't hide, it's gon' find you
And you can't front, it's behind you
I ain't sayin' it's not your world
But just remember that it's mine too
