[Verse 1]
Black Water, looking glass
No wind it's still at last
Cold whisper in the air
"Storm's coming, please beware!"
Storm's coming... gonna need
Sand bags and batteries...
Old pictures, letters too
Frozen moments, favorite shoes
Wine bottles, diamond rings
No value in expensive things
How do you measure, by the price?
What is precious to my life?

[Hook]
'Cuz all I'm in love with is the music
'Cuz all I'm in love with is the music
(All I need)

[Verse 2]
Black Water, deep as night
Too quiet, no moonlight
Take caution, don't be fooled
Storm's coming, coming soon!
Storm's coming, so prepare
It's worse on the unaware
Ohh
When all the signs are saying that it won't be enough
Then everything inside me screams 'I'm not giving up, no"
I'll stay afloat while they're drowning in
Black Water, Black Water, Black Water, Black Water

[Hook]
All I'm in love with is the music
(All I love, I love)
'Cuz all I'm in love with is the music
(All I need)
