[Verse One]
Do you know what it's like when your parents fuckin' hate each other?
They were married but he treat her like a baby mother
And they were fightin' over custody
It got so violent at times, they need a referee
Mama tellin' daddy to pack and move his shit
The cops are comin' through so much, I thought that they were movin' in
So mama caught a beatin', she couldn't sleep in her bed
'Cause she was hidin' underneath it
While he was makin' friends with everyone in the precinct
The charges never stuck, man he ain't even stay a weekend
Another bruise, another scrape or cut, yeah
Another reason to cake make-up up
When he was boozed and all the anger come, yeah
The shit is true, I wish I made it up, I swear
Yeah, the shit is true, I wish I made it up, I swear

[Hook]
Hey, mom fucked up just like us
It's not our fault we're so fucked up, no way, no way
But we still gotta pay for all of your mistakes
There's nothin' you could say to me
So please don't point the blame on me
'Cause we still gotta pay for all of your mistakes
There's nothin' you could say to me
So please don't point the blame on me, blame on me

[Verse Two]
They tried to settle it in court but we ain't get a penny for support
Damn, remember goin' to the store and then we get in line
And worry if the card we were payin' with was gon' get declined
She always put up a front like shit was fine
Workin' three jobs just to get us Reeboks
And makin' sure the fridge and the kitchen would be stocked
But she did her best just to get us what she want
And his family didn't say shit 'cause they ain't family
They just people that I share some DNA with
But we ain't wait around for somebody to come and save us
'Cause you could waste your whole damn life by bein' patient
Another bruise, another scrape or cut, yeah
Another year goes by where he ain't pay for nothin'
Sometimes I lie to myself and I say I'm well adjusted
The shit is true, I wish I made it up, I swear

[Hook]
Hey, mom fucked up just like us
It's not our fault we're so fucked up, no way, no way
But we still gotta pay for all of your mistakes
There's nothin' you could say to me
So please don't point the blame on me
'Cause we still gotta pay for all of your mistakes
There's nothin' you could say to me
So please don't point the blame on me, blame on me
