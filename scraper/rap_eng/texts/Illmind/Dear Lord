Verse 1:

They couldn't recognize me in rare form
I stepped into this game with my angel wings and my horns
To my copiers, copy this to your floppy disk
Gave oppositions options and now their families mourn
Dear Lord he just wanted that four-door Porcshe
Give him fortunes, let him know that he deserves more
World tours, gold counter-tops and Marble floors
Give me more, I want everything I can't afford
Niggas came a long way, whippin' in that Hyundai
Riding down Hampton but I'm feeling mucho grande
Making money legal even though I know that crime pays
I can't be another statistic to this crime rates
Homicide; bodies going up, pain coming down
Mama look, your son is blowing up, where's he going now
Father never bothered showing up, such a lonely child
They don't know how to seize the moment, I can show you how

Hook:

Look how they wish they had my shine
But you can't steal my light
And everybody knows that it's my time
These niggas want to live my...

Verse 2:

My mama was raised in the era when
Crack rocks were being served to the darkest skin
'93 she gave birth to infinity, that rose grew from concrete
Look what these cracks did to me
What's the meaning of being dope when you come from it huh?
In a world that's so sick, you can't stomach huh?
I don't care about your cars and your clothes
Niggas talking fly shit, but they always seem to plummet huh?
Dear Lord I can only pray for my enemies
It seems the only thing stopping me is my inner me
I'm steady being chased by night terrors, I an't even sleep
Is this what I get for not wearing my heart on my sleeve

Ending breakdown (x2):

Who's gonna break me down?
Who's gonna break me down now?
