[Jhene:]
You don't know me
You don't know me
Yeaaaaaaaaaa no no no
[Jhene drop tha vocals]
[Jhene:]
I tested you that you let me know
The otha side of you
Boi you had me fool
Got me twisted yo with the adverage gurl
Doin me like that you in anotha world
Thought you were tha type to love and treat me right
Boi i was wrong caught up in yo ghetto hype
Tryin to play me out who you dealin wit
It ain't me 'cause you don't know me

[Chorus 2x]
Do you really think you know me
What Do I look like a puppet on a string
What you think is so suddenly
You gon' play me
What you don't know me
'cause i know me

[Dude:(second verse)]
[Jhene:]
I let you in my life
You tried to pull me down
Almost feel for it
But boi i need to quit
Tell me what to do
I'll be on my year
See i been schooled to these fakin moves
Betta get it straight 'cause i know the rules
So don't question me and try to run my base
It don't go that way
Neva will go that way
Trust me when i say you don't know me

[Chorus 2x]

[Bridge:]
I know you don't know me
Tryina pull sumthin on me
Tryina play games on me
I know you don't know me
I know you don't know me
Tryina pull sumthin on me
Tryina play games on me
I know you don't know me

[Chorus 6x]
