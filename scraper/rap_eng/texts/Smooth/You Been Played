[Intro: Smooth talking over the hook]
It's real funny though cause you thought you was getting me. All the while you was being eyed

[Hook]
You know it, you know it, you know that you've been played
Get out my face
Get out my face
You know it, you know it, you know that you've been played
Get out my face
Get out my face

[Verse One]
You've been played and I think you know it
You're too large to even try to show it
But I used you
I used you as a stepping stone and when I was through I sent your sorry butt home
I was calling, begging for the third legging
But truthfully, Smooth was only playing
I was on my mental was how that I could do thee
But now you jock so hard baby that you play the groupie

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
I'm young, but baby I'm a tender
My game is fresh I know what you don't remember
You thinking you can get but ya gotten
From the get go
Smooth was already out plotting
So think twice before ya step
The way I'mma come here is fo' my due respect
And you can't stop me (Naw he can't stop me)
I'm looking at my clock and I slowly see you clocking me
When I was in the womb of mom before the birth of me
I never aggravated or kick, I was a smooth baby
So feel the wrath of Smooth as I start slashing
No need for compassion, in a psychological fashion
I beat ya for your mind and not for your money
And now it's coming quick and baby looking kinda funny
People are ya ready?
People are ya ready? Here's a clue, baby I smooth played you

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Another notch to the scenario, the story get's deeper
But pay your mind for a smooth unorthodox creeper
I had a tip
A tip of the one
And now ya sprung
On the smooth vocally cause I'm the one
You thought that you could get but baby now that you've been gotten
From the get go Smooth was only out for plotting
So skibby scram hot damn cause you can't understand
That you've been played

When I was in the womb of mom before the birth of me
I never aggravated or kicked, I was a smooth baby
So feel the wrath of Smooth as I start slashing
No need for compassion, in a psychological fashion
Not taking for the money
Taking for ya mind and now the stuff's kinda funny
People are ya ready?
People are ya ready? Here's a clue
Baby I smooth played you

[Hook]

You can't figure out what's on my mind, oooh oooh
I don't need you, no
I told you
But you wouldn't listen
Yeeeeah

[Outro]
See you know um, it's not easy to play a player baby. So you can't play me. Let me tell you um...
