[Chorus]
I don't know if you don't know
Where our love should go
Loving you's impossible
Girl, I don't know
Where our love should go
Loving you's impossible

[Verse 1]
You call me late at night
Trying to start a fight
Girl, you know you've changed
I won't play these games
I sit and reminisce
Of us just kicking it
Now you wanna trip
I'm not having it

[Chorus]
I don't know if you don't know
Where our love should go
Loving you's impossible
Girl, I don't know
Where our love should go
Loving you's impossible

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna front
You used to treat me right
I don't understand
What happened to our plan
No man's supposed to cry
But girl, I can't deny
What I feel inside
These feelings I can't hide

[Chorus]
I don't know if you don't know
Where our love should go
Loving you's impossible
Girl, I don't know
Where our love should go
Loving you's impossible

[Bridge]
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo, doo

[Chorus (4x)]
I don't know if you don't know
Where our love should go
Loving you's impossible
Girl, I don't know
Where our love should go
Loving you's impossible
