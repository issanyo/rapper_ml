[Intro]
Uh, listen up

[Verse 1]
I know you want it, you wanna hit it
But you can't have it, oops, can't touch it
Maybe a kiss on these lips
In holding hands it ain't nothing
Nasty is what you call me
But not sure you can't handle it
'Cause I'm not ready for what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not the average kinda girl

[Chorus]
I might let you touch me
I might let you hold me
I might even let you kiss me
But you can not take my virginity
I might let you tease me
I might let you squeeze me
I might even let you kiss me
But you can not take my virginity

[Verse 2]
Can't imagine what it feels like
My friends say it's alright
But then they go and do it all night
But I prefer the marry life
Patience is what you gotta have
That's what it takes to be my man
I'm not like that bad if you like me
Keep it with you then maybe

[Chorus]
I might let you touch me
I might let you hold me
I might even let you kiss me
But you can not take my virginity
I might let you tease me
I might let you squeeze me
I might even let you kiss me
But you can not take my virginity

[Bridge]
Baby, it's not like I don't really like you
You just gotta know
That if you're not willing to wait for my loving
Then you gotta go
Baby it's not like I don't really like you
You just gotta know
That if you're not willing to wait for my loving
Then you gotta go

[Verse 3: Needa-S]
God damn, what part don't you understand?
The N or the O?
You get nothing from TG4
Let it go
Here we go with this everyday scenario

Got the jeans painted on
Cleavage out
Don't mean she easy
Girl, you gotta keep your integrity
I wouldn't let him get over on me
Don't fall for the same game
Him calling you boo
Telling you he love you and all the things he gon' do

Treat your body like a temple
The best thing ever made
'Cause once you let him hit
Watch how those feelings fade
You gotta be the best at this game being played
Don't give it up now
Some things are better off saved

[Chorus]
I might let you touch me
I might let you hold me
I might even let you kiss me
But you can not take my virginity
I might let you tease me
I might let you squeeze me
I might even let you kiss me
But you can not take my virginity
