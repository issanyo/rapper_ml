[Chorus]
I love you, you know it
I ain't too proud to show it
When it's love

[Verse 1: Batman]
What will I do for love (what will I do)
My love is real
Girl you know, you know, you know
You knock me out
You give me good love
Without a doubt (without a doubt)
No one can tell us
What to feel inside

[Chorus (2x)]
I love you, you know it
I ain't too proud to show it
When it's love

[Verse 2: Batman]
You're so understanding, my friend (you're so understanding, my friend)
There through thick and thin (there through thick and thin)
So girl, let's not pretend (girl, let's not pretend)
Who's to say what's right or wrong
Our love is strong (love is strong)
Girl, you know our love is on
It's on

[Chorus (2x)]
I love you, you know it
I ain't too proud to show it
When it's love

[Verse 3: Romeo]
Girl, you know you knock me out , without a doubt
Nothing on my mind but you 'cause you're my boo
My boo, my boo
You're so understanding (understanding)
My friend through the end, through thick and thin
So don't pretend
So don't front on my love
'Cause I get deep in love

[Chorus (2x)]
I love you, you know it
I ain't too proud to show it
When it's love

[Bridge 1: LDB]
What's up, girl?
You know I love you
You're down for anything
Immature just kicking it
Just thinking about you

[Chorus (2x)]
I love you, you know it
I ain't too proud to show it
When it's love

[Bridge 2]
Ooh-oooh-oooh, oh, oh
Ooh-oooh-oooh, oh, oh
Ooh-oooh-oooh, oh, oh
Ooh-oooh-oooh, oh, oh
Ooh-oooh-oooh, oh, oh
Ooh-oooh-oooh, oh, oh
Ooh-oooh-oooh, oh, oh
Ooh-oooh-oooh, oh, oh
Ooh-oooh-oooh, oh, oh

[Chorus (repeat until fade)]
I love you, you know it
I ain't too proud to show it
When it's love
