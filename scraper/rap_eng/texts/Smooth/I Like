Ooh, boy
Oh, yeah

I like the way you move
I know that I like you
I know that I do

I like the things you do
I know that I like you
I know that I do
Boy, I wanna get with you

One day I took a stroll walking down the streat
And when I bumped into you
That's when I knew you were the one
Oh, yeah
We were friends for a very long time
Back then I was young
I'm a woman now
So, listen to me when I say

I like the things you do
I know that I like you
I know that I do
I like the way you walk
I like the way you talk

Baby, won't you give me your seven digits
So I can give you a call
And baby, we can talk all night
Oh, yeah
Every girl in town wants to get with you, boy
I never give 'em a chance
You're meant to be my man

I know you like him
But don't be a fool
Take it from the Smooth
Don't let him play you like a fool

It sounds good when a woman wants your man
Scoping when you walk down the block and they clock
And if he's all that
Keep the bowie owie strapped

Nicey, take your time
Do it right
Give it a chance
If he's what you like, yeah
This is Smooth
And that's the way it goes

I like the things you do
I know that I do
I knew you were the one
I like the things you do
I know that I do
Take the chance of my love

I think it's time for us to talk
To get more acquainted
I wanna hear the things you like
Oh, yeah
Being more than friends and more like lovers
I never wanna leave you baby
Please hold me tight

I like the things you do
I know that I do
I wanna get closer to you, baby
