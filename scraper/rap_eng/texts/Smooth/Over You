Hhmmmmm yeeaaah yeah yeeeah
I never got over you
(now what i do is think about you)
It seems so much went wrong
Even though so much was right
So many unspoken words
So many sleepless nights
What i wouldn't give to have baby you standing by my side
What i wouldn't give to have baby you still here in my life
Tell where it all went wrong(all went wrong)
Can you look me in my face
And tell me where it all went wrong (all went wrong)
Cause i don't know what i did
Tell where it all went wrong(all went wrong )
Can you look me in my eyes
Tell where it all went wrong(all went wrong )
Cause i don't know what i did
Girl am not over you, not over you
And i really need you back
Girl am not over you, not over you
And am missing what we had
Girl am not over you, not over you
And i dont think i`ll be soon
So can i get you back
Cause am missing what we had
Girl am not over you, not over you, not over you
(I said am not over you )
Ammm nooo (girl am not over you)
I said am not oooovvvveeeerrr you
Hmmm those thing that make us weaker they also make us stronger
You can`t just give up every time we disagree nooo
I`ve given so much to this
And i don't wanna see whether away
So baby can you take the time
To come and try explain to me what`s happening, what`s happening
Can you look me in my face
And tell me what`s happening, what`s happening
Cause i don't know what i did
Tell me what`s happening, what`s happening
Can you look me in my eyes
And  tell me what`s happening, what`s happening
Cause i don't know what i did
Girl am not over you, not over you
And i really need you back
Girl am not over you, not over you
And am missing what we had
Girl am not over you, not over you
And i don't think i`ll be soon
So can i get you back
Cause am missing what we had
Girl am not over you,over you, over you
And i really need you back
Girl am not over you,not over you
And am missing what we had
Girl am not over you,not over you
And i don't think i`ll be soon
So can i get you back
Cause am missing what we had
Girl am not over you,over you, over you
