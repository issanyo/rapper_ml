Song:   Strawberries and Hennessey

[Intro]
Coming at you once again
Yeah, uh huh
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessey)
It's the one and only, yeah
The female Mack, yeah
Oh, oh, oh baby, yeah
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessey)
That's right, yeah, babe
(Strawberries on top)

The store is open boy
Won't you come inside
Try some goodies on isle 69
(Let me love you down)

Your appetite for love
Is what I like
Oh, won't you let me give you some of this
Chocolate tonight

Feel like sippin' on your spell tonight
Baby, Hennessey up under candlelight
(I like that)
Run some bubble bath and let's enjoy the night
I'm that tight
(Strawberries on top)

One little kiss on my lips will be
Enough to start it off, you will see, baby
Bring some strawberries and Hennessey
We can make love endlessly
(Do it baby)

Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessey
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows
(The way my love flows)

Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessey
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows

If you could keep it real
Right when my body feels
Good and ready
To satisfy your needs

Just when I'm 'bout to let you
Get inside
I'll be your Mary Jane
Boy you know I'll get you so hot

Feel like sippin' on your spell tonight
(oh, yeah baby)
Baby, Hennessey up under candlelight
(I like that)
Run some bubble bath and let's enjoy the night
I'm that tight
(I'm freaky)

One little kiss on my lips will be
Enough to start it off, you will see, baby (yeah)
Bring some strawberries and Hennessey
We can make love endlessly
(Let's make love, baby)

Strawberries on top of me (yeah)
Candlelight, a little Hennessey
(A little Hennessey)
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows
(On top of me)

Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessey (uh huh)
That's the way, (right) that's the way
My love flows

[Rap]
Gots all the right tools to get you hooked
Ya gots to have it
Taste this flava, now ya feenin', it's a habit
You wanna come inside
From the rain
This girl's got more game than "The little"
Headed straight for the top
That's the way it's going down, boo
Once I get my props
I want a little bit of this
Little bit of that
Wanna baby oil ya cuz the female Mack is back, wit

Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessey
That's the way, that's the way
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessey)
My love flows

A real good man
Who ain't afraid to do it right
Serving me sounds nice
Even if it takes all night

I want a real good man
Who ain't afraid to do it right
Serving me sounds nice
Even if it takes all night

Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessey
That's the way, that's the way
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessey)
My love flows
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessey)
