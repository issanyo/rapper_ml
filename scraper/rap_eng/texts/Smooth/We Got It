[Chorus (2x): Immature]
I'm giving you all my time
Just come and feel the flavor
Whether it's rain or shine
'Cause we got it

[Verse 1: Batman]
Thinking of you is all I do
Daydreaming about my boo
Crazy days, I like your silly ways
Just thinking 'bout you
What can I do

[Chorus (2x): Immature]
I'm giving you all my time
Just come and feel the flavor
Whether it's rain or shine
'Cause we got it

[Verse 2: Batman]
I know our love is real
You make my mind do flips
It's funny how you make me feel
Toss and turning in my bed
My time is just for you
24/7, our love is true

[Chorus (2x): Immature]
I'm giving you all my time
Just come and feel the flavor
Whether it's rain or shine
'Cause we got it

[Verse 3: Smooth]
It's the mack of the year in your ear
With the flavor you've been waiting for
A taste in your face, don't take it personal
Four deep, we gonna creep for the street
Smooth, Batman and Romeo and LDB
Throw your hands in the air, put the bounce in your body
Microphone check, now scream lodi dodi
Ain't no party like an Immature party
Give them props 'cause you love what they got

[Chorus (4x): Immature]
I'm giving you all my time
Just come and feel the flavor
Whether it's rain or shine
'Cause we got it

[Outro: Immature]
Don't you wanna feel the funk (we got it)
What we got is what you want (we got it)
Don't you wanna feel the funk (we got it)
What we got is what you want (we got it)
Don't you wanna feel the funk (we got it)
What we got is what you want (we got it)
