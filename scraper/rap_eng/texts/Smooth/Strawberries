[Intro]
Coming at you once again
Yeah, uh huh
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessy)
It's the one and only, yeah
The Female Mac, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh baby, yeah
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessy)
That's right, yeah, babe
(Straw-berr-berries on top)

[Verse 1]
The store is open boy
Won't you come inside
Try some goodies on aisle 69
(Let me love you down)
Your appetite for love
Is what I like
Oh, won't you let me give you some of this
Chocolate tonight

[Bridge 1]
Feel like sipping on Cristal tonight
Maybe Hennessy up under candlelight (I like that)
Run some bubble bath and let's enjoy the night
I'm that tight (Strawberries on top)
One little kiss on my lips will be
Enough to start it off, you will see, baby
Bring some strawberries and Hennessy
We can make love endlessly (Do it baby)

[Chorus 1]
Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows (The way my love flows)

Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows

[Verse 2]
If you could keep it real
Right when my body feels
Good and ready
To satisfy your needs
Just when I'm 'bout to let you
Get inside
I'll be your Mary Jane
Boy you know I'll get you so high

[Bridge 2]
Feel like sipping on Cristal tonight
(oh, yeah baby)
Maybe Hennessy up under candlelight (I like that)
Run some bubble bath and let's enjoy the night
I'm that tight (I'm freaky)
One little kiss on my lips will be (uh)
Enough to start it off, you will see, baby (yeah)
Bring some strawberries and Hennessy
We can make love endlessly (Let's make love, baby)

[Chorus 2]
Strawberries on top of me (yeah)
Candlelight, a little Hennessy (A little Hennessy)
That's the way, that's the way
My love flows (On top of me)

Strawberries on top of me (with strawberries)
Candlelight, a little Hennessy (yeah)
That's the way, that's the way
(That’s the way my love flows)
My love flows

Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
(Won’t you be my freak tonight)
That's the way, that's the way
(Come on daddy, do me right)
My love flows (yeah)

Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy (uh huh)
That's the way (right), that's the way
My love flows

[Rap]
Gots all the right tools to get you hooked
You gots to have it
Taste this flava, now ya feenin', it's a habit
You wanna, come inside, from the rain
This girl's got more game than a little
Headed straight for the top
That's the way it's going down, boo
Once I get my props
I want a little bit of this
Little bit of that
Warm the baby oil ‘cause the Female Mac is back, wit’…

Strawberries (on top)
Strawberries on top of me
That’s the way (yeah)
On top of me

Strawberries
Strawberries on top of me
That’s the way (yeah)

[Bridge 3]
Feel like sipping on Cristal tonight
Maybe Hennessy up under candlelight
Run some bubble bath and let's enjoy the night
I'm that tight (I’m freaky)
One little kiss on my lips will be (uh)
Enough to start it off, you will see, baby (yeah)
Bring some strawberries and Hennessy
We can make love endlessly

[Chorus 3 (Repeat 2x)]
Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
That's the way, that's the way
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessy)
My love flows

A real good man
Who ain't afraid to do it right
Serving me sounds nice
Even if it takes all night

I want a real good man
Who ain't afraid to do it right
Serving me sounds nice
Even if it takes all night

[Outro Chorus]
Strawberries on top of me
Candlelight, a little Hennessy
That's the way, that's the way
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessy)
My love flows
(Strawberries on top with some Hennessy)
