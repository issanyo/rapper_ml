[Verse 1]
Bitch, I wake up
Wake up everyday
Get my cake up, get my cake up
Tryna stack in every way
Damn, it's great, my life so great
I Swear to God, sip pink lemonade
And I don't know 'bout whatchu say, say
Give a fuck 'bout whatchu say

And I be high...

[Bridge]
Toast to the sky
Most of my niggas be high
Most of my niggas we do this shit just to get by
These niggas be mad, they be lyin' though
Lyin' on the man, that so crazy
And I don't even know why y'all hate
Sippin' this pink, bitch I'm lazy

[Verse 2]
And bitch I be slowed up
Slowed up, slow motion
These bitches be goin'
They go for the nigga
They go for the team, we all in the team
We only split bitches, we only split swishers
We split open bags, we never split money
We smoke our own grams
These niggas be mad
Toast to the mans (x2)
We toast to the mans

[Verse 3]
Slowed off them xans, we slowed off them xans
We just might OD off them xans
These niggas be mad, they got out their hands
Cause we gettin' bands, cause we gettin' bands
Niggas is trippin', these niggas be lyin'
They tellin' these bitches we just wanna try 'em
They tryin', they tryin' but they can't pass by us
You know we be fast in the whip we be drivin'
You try us, you dyin'
You think that we're lyin' then try us you pussy
Swear all of you dyin' (x3)
