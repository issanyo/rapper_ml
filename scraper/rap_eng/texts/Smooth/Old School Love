[Smooth]
You know you want it baby
You know you need it baby
Come and get it baby
Old school love
You know you want it baby
(Where you been at all this time?)
You know you need it baby
(The one that I've been thinking of)
Come and get it baby

[Immature]
Way back in the day
I had a thing for you
But I was too young
You said it wouldn't be cool
You said give you a call
After a year or two
Now the time has past
And now I'm looking for you

1 - [Smooth](Immature)
You know you want it baby
(I can't fight)
You know you need it baby
(I can't deny it)
Come and get it baby
(I wanna try it)
Old school love

2 - [Immature]
It's time you took the time to see
Just what a man I've come to be
All the patience and maturity
I know that you are feeling me
[Smooth]
Where you been at all this time
I've been searching trying to find
The one that I've been thinking of
Come and get this old school love

[Immature]
I finally found you
I can't believe its true
You're looking so good
I can't believe its you
I'm all bad now
So what's it gonna be
Let it flow, never fear
Your curiosity, yeah

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

[Smooth](Immature)
What? What?
Yeah, I watched you grow up from boys to men
From rolling hot scooters
To pushing a chromed out Benz
Went from never lying to satisfying
From 7up sippin', to Lex Coupe dippin'
You used to run around the stage
Yeah rocking them shows (Right?)
Now you all grown up laced in platinum and gold
Uh-huh, playtime is over ain't no kid no more (No, no)
You used to rock small theaters now it's sold out tours
You turning heads boo, you know the game that you chose (Right?)
No need for getting caught up and chasing them hoes
Girls twenty-one plus, yeah they waiting on you
To put it down, hanging at your shows when come to town
You know the ones, the ones that used to sleep
(I can't fight it)
Yeah they checking now
(I can't deny it)
(I wanna try it)
(Old school love)

Repeat 2

[Smooth]
Where you been at all this time?
I've been searching trying to find

[Immature]
It's time you took the time to see
Just what a man I've come to be
Oh, oh

Repeat 2
