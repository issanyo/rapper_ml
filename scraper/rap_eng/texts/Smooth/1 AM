[Intro]
YG: Alright, come whoop me nigga, I’m right here nigga
Bang my line when you know what’s up
Unnamed Caller: Fo sho, alright

[Verse 1]
It was 1 in the mornin' and I was up yawnin'
Moms asked where I'm goin', to the hood if you ain't knowin'
Pops locked up so mama couldn't stop me
I was out the house, ASAP Rocky
And it wasn't cause she couldn't control us
We was her babies, she just wanted to hold us
And we ain't get disciplined, her friend started whisperin'
About how she was a bad mama, mama said "fuck 'em then"
I was in the streets stylin', nobody could tell me nothin'
Grandpa or grandma, not my auntie or my favorite cousin
I was buzzin'
Fuckin' all these hoes wearing no condoms, no nothin'
I used to ditch school when the homie had the Chevy
I used to sneak and smoke stress weed

[Hook]
But now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
Now I'm rollin' on dubs
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?
All these hoes showin' love
How you feel, whooptie woop, nigga, what?

[Verse 2]
SKKKRRRT, I was on a mission
On a mission to the money, sun down till it sunny
Know my family love me
Ridin' in the car with two niggas and a pistol
This ain't funny, I do it all for the money, hold up
Slowly as I pull up to the donut stand, I already know the plan
Hop out and get on your mans and take what he got
Go through pockets, wallets and socks, dig all the knots
It's a stick-up, phone ring, it's my mama
In the middle of some drama, so I don't pick up
Thinking I gotta get my shit up, I gotta pick my bitch up
Let's hurry up and leave, I feel the police near us
So we left with a thousand dollars cash
It was me and my nigga, so you know I went half
Then shit get real when niggas get greedy
Pop, pop, pop, pow, that's when he leave me
