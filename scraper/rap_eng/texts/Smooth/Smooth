Man, its a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well, I hear you whispering the words that melt everyone
But you stay so cool
My munequita
My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause youre so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
It's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real or else forget about it
Ill tell you one thing
If you would leave, it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word
I hear your name calling me out
Out from the barrio
You hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause youre so smooth
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Its the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real or else forget about it
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Its the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart, make it real or else forget about it
