VERSE I
My ADD
You know it got the best of me
ADHD it got me feeling free
And I'm happy as I wanna be
But my head is so spacey
And I'm laughing while the preacher is talking to me
And I'm laughing while the counselor is talking to me
They say "You're not serious enough
Walter Reed", as I take a puff
I used to have a handle on life
But it broke
I see the government as a joke
Peeping his emotions through the weed smoke
One by one the squirrels steal my sanity, now I need hope

HOOK
Right over left (x7)
Good over evil
Hallelujah, praise is king
Is it James, is it Lutheran or Constantine?
Just copped us a jar of weed, puff and pass with the homies (x2)

VERSE II
So wake the heavens
Shake the Earth for the sun has smirked
And the moonlight on our beautiful dirt
I'm just high, watching it go by, just watching it go by
And the preacher said "Let the church sing and say Amen"
I'm just high, passing some Hen
So let the people rise
With our palms to the skies
Rejoice to the Most High
But really, we're the most high
I punched Ty
The usher sees us
In disgust she says "Jesus"
Grabs us by the collar
Kick us out the church
I seen the tray, I leave a dollar, put God first
The stars burst, look up
The sky is rainbow colors
A dog walks by and said "Hello"
I said "Good doggy", he said "Good fellow"
Now tell me there ain't happiness in the ghetto

VERSE III
Listen up, boys and girls, this is the mystery
They shoved in the pockets of history
See, God's a tailor for fabric of existence is sewn
And now it's shown
Psalm 147 and 4
Mount Seri
Under the stronghold
The base of the Anunnaki
The mass planet decays into anarchy
Alien strong hold remote
Views and army control
Watch files
Who design the Adam to be
The covering protector of Eve
Built a Martensite city
With Hematite glass windows
Precise formula restore mankind
Precise formula restore mankind
