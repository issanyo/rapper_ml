[Intro: Killah Priest]
M-Eighty, Dreddy Kruger, Killah Priest, Iron Sheik
Yeah, you know we gon' do this all the way from Indianapolis
Empty, you wanna empty the gat's, whatever
Its Black Market, Wu-Tang Clan, you know how we do it
Yo, M-Eighty, yo Dred, check this out

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Between these nine's and these four shells, their stories will tell
Behind prison walls, niggas fell out their wars
Wyling out in their hoods 'til they wind up in morgues
Inside a pool halls, staircase, or black hallways
I recall days of youngster bringing home poor grades
Mom's beefing, took my weekend from b-ball day
I truly feel if it wasn't for rap there would be more grades
I politic with the Preacher with his hair all gray
I politic with the Arabs, What do you want for that gauge?
Matter of face let me test the MAC next to that gauge
For blacks to kill blacks is why these weapons were made
The best are engraved, the worst is still here
May the hurst of will chair
You choose how you wanna lead, follow my lead
Cause it's Killah Priest, the Revolutionary
White people will go bald, while blacks suited from vary
You know it's legendary, it's Killah Priest the Iron Sheik
CHAMPIONS!!!

[Verse 2: M-Eighty]
Hip-hop again, homey's want what they suppose to be
Mostly wanna be like emcees and coming close to me
I wear them out like rosary, wanna kick it with Priest
These fat-less wanna succeed
The fact they threw my lyrical speech
I'm hearing you preach, but nowadays the older guys ain't listening
Newborn's novice, rappers I'm daunting you at your christenings
Country fries are sizzling, gravy up on my Grandson's
Bought my Dick Clark's and Wallaby's, fan stand
Digi stands in hands pennons up on the podium
Crack the bath, crackers get smoked with baking sodium
Sold on the block it's a rock wrecked with the aluminum
Dealers deal the evil to people; look what you do to them
It's hard to breathe, the starving seed's
Like when it all falls down for them autumn leaves
They're running under bridges
Cook up a cake quicker than biscuits
So watch me sell something raw
While I'm slinging for the slickers
CHAMPIONS!!!

[Verse 3: Dreddy Kruger]
I love my music to death, I'd rather die then be deaf
I got CD's from shelf to shelf
I got CD's on health, wealth; knowledge is self and my self
From Classical to R&B, Hip-Hop to Rock
Hill Scott to Jill Scott
On the block with S. Dot's and ankle socks
Reading an Autobiography off Kenyatta Jone's Pop
I learned a lot, who gives a fuck about what you got

[Hook: M-Eighty]
I'm the CHAMPION! What the fuck you say?
I'm the CHAMPION! What the fuck you say?

Outro) Priest
Yeah, knowwhatimean?, Dreddy Kruger to Killah Priest, M-Eighty
We doing it, yo they gon' always champ for the CHAMPIONS
They're always gon' champ for the CHAMPIONS is here
The CHAMPIONS, it's the CHAMPIONS, uh, one...
