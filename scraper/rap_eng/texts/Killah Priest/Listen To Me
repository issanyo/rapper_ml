[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
I light my candles under Saint Anthony
Burning rosemary for friends and families, for those buried
For all humanity and soul's heavy
Ride through life like an old Chevy
Look at the world through your rear view
And honk your horn till they hear you
So after you're gone it's tribute
For all the pain that you've lived through
Rainstorms are now clear blue
A king's gone on your mural, wings form in the spiritual
The ritual for those we long here's my tears and a tissue
I opened it, look how they turned to diamonds
Shows your reflection cause you're still shining
The worldly body had to do some dying
Transformation, so I leave this here with the plants of fragrance
Before you roam the land of the ancient
My mind's an enigma filled with broken pictures
The spiritual thug could see clearer now

[Hook: Killah Priest]
So, just listen to me, just listen to me
Just listen to me, just listen to me

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Light up a cigar let the aroma reach ya
It's like the smile on the Mona Lisa
Holding a child that rose on Easter
Like a cloud passing over Giza
Peep the style of my older teachers
Sipping Crown as he blow his cheeba
*raps in Hebrew*, the brother’s keeper
Where hustlers lead up
The mothers and grievers receive a hug from the preacher
Abundances are cousins and nieces
And nephew, God bless you
Markus daily you made the heart heavy, departed too early
You the seen the reign of stock on that dark prairie
On know your ghost floats through them bars pearly
Comfort for Aunt Chery
After cremation we dreaming their faces
In Kingdoms that’s gated, though it seems spacious
It’s meditated in Heavenly places
All human families that destined will make it
God became Man so that Man becomes God
On the land and amongst stars
Reminisce when I ran with my young squad
Cuff his hands, caught a gun charge
Bullet wounds, jailed, some scarred
Shout outs to Love, Shop, Brood, Tommy, Rocket, Sun God
From Gates Ave. Niffy was a great man
Put his face inside a stained glass
Wearing crucifixes and gang flags

[*Verse Removed from album version*]
His weed storm passes on then it rains down on my peoples
I see Sean Bond walking through walls
I see Mark Spark flowing through halls
Tommy Rock coming through floors
Plus continue grieving my heart
When I speak in the dark, I weep in the park
The spirit departs of Mark
Lyrical sharp as shark
From the roots to the trunk to the bark
This is my art; this is my Ark of Noah, Joana
Farewell I sail from the Narc's which is the holy body
Stained Glass paragraph, preparation of the gospel of peace
Apostle or Beast, colossal on streets
Starring at the walls till the walls become a door
The Door opened, before me was a great ocean
And a throne with my two sides, my Omens and my chosen, fantasize
I let it fly from hell or rise
Mesmerized by the enterprise starship, mega-size
God lifts then our hypnotised projects flipped its scribes
I start climbing out this hell-hole as the souls go

[Hook: Killah Priest]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
There's no eyeing like understanding
There's no blindness like ignorance
Better then a young man's knowledge is the old man's experience
There's no evil to sickness, nothing so dreaded as death
What's the heal for forgiveness?
Pride before fall, look inside myself and did some cleansing
Drop my defenses, begin the rinsing
Tonight a lion sleeps in the heart of every brave man
Like a cave in the African lands
The Immaculate stand to inhabit what's grand
Above is the black poison clouds
You only got one life so enjoy it now
And cherish the day before you perish away
We all inherit the grave; these are the letters that say:
Together we pray, Heaven's amaze
Shed tears in my silver Offering bowl
Incense burn Patchouli smoke for the lost souls
At the fork in the road

[Hook]
