VERSE I
Wonderful lost civilization called the Land of Mu
Supreme life marine animals
Long ago when this planet ruled
A fate speaker, a great leader, a snake creature
That taught from a cave called the holy reef
And divine coral
We're not immortal
Time portal he would preach
The king of grief
'cause they took his peace
He was sad because the prophecies he'll one day meet
And his people
As he falls to sleep in his water cathedral
Then they ordered the evil

VERSE II
Crash landing of extra terrestrials
Nursed back to health by a small sect of Eskimos
Then they taught them that the air can grow vegetables
And the stars that align and you are symmetrical
Held a serpent entwined
Like what you see today used by the medical
Wait Meta Khemet sin
Sumerian I guess, that's the pre-script-ion
Somehow we related to Dolphins
Melaninated though carbon
Then elevated to soverign
They extended their mythic art
With science that can rip physics apart
See my lyrics is art
The scriptures are dark
A Kabbalistic chart
By releasing the captive Messiah
Ten practice in ciphers
Dressed in crimson sacrificial attire
Open the book of legends
The smoke ascend into heaven
The seven spirits descending in seconds
Feeling the frequency of the Phoenix when it's breathing
All the planets and everything living we all in sequence
