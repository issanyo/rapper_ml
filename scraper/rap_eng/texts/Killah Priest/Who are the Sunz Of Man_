[Chorus 2X: Hell Razah (all)]
When I say 'Sunz of', you say 'Man'
(Sunz of Man, Sunz of Man)

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
When my lyrics touch the frozen, he crosses the lost as I've rosen out my mental grave, living dead trapped in my head
I know the ledge and still learnin, the ignorant brain surgeon
Here's your permanent effect of a death servant
To all satanic maniacs when I give these raps
Your mental will collapse back down to the surface
Of the Earth with these murderous disasters
For all wicked pastors, they burn to ashes
And blew to churches, with verses, curses
Now we bury them in metal hearses, cemented clones
Fuck his tombstone, the unknown dimension
Don't close your brain yet, be my guest
The holder, when I release the stress, unusual
Running over you, with my rhymes with jewels, rituals
Dealing with your spiritual reality
Fatalities come from inner me through the outer me
Disbelievers get amnesia on a trip to the higher galaxy
My shadow leaves your soul through the white hole
I tried to swallow me, demons don't follow me

[Verse 2: Prodigal Sunn]
I be the planet inheritor, master, soul controller
Writer of the lyrical manifold, I explode with the Craftmatic scrolls
Giving you a taste of death, seven bullets through your chest
Then I rest in peace, then you die in stress
I torch your carcass in the middle of the Dead Sea
You drown in misery, lost his shroud in reality
And through my mental chemistry life is propelled
In this pit of collision, America, for sure to call it Hell
It came to pass that I was sent as a visionary
I travel with the humble, still bled through the struggle
The last of survival, soaking knowledge both sides of the equator
Science and mathematic refills my attic
From what I visualize I'm stranded in the wilderness
I'm forced to fight, driven into the darkness
Opposing war with mercenaries and devils
With the Sunz of Man I stroll through Hell, defeating fucking rebels
But feeling the bolts of Ovadiah
I led the dead through the fire, persecuting the liar
It said the meek shall inherit the Earth
For all it's worth I teach my seeds to take heed or bleed during childbirth

[Verse 3: 7th Ambassador]
Tensions in the atmosphere so you're best to beware
Or be burned by my flames of fury
Cause I be the executioner, judge and the jury
And once I've reached the verdict your ass will be murdered
In a second, execution style, decapitate your head with my wreck
When I fling it like a Frisbee, I throw two LPs
To bust a dome down into three different parts
Plus I have some CDs aiming for your heart
As I shoot 'em, they're left lodged in your bone and your flesh
Protruding through the surface of your chest
The fluids are still leaking from your neck, what a mess
Can be created, when my explosive temper's activated
Niggas don't know the anger I possess, within
The conscious capability of sin, it's killing me
Slowly, even the unholy can't control me
When I'm on that different level, go to Hell with the Devil
And the God that you say I must pray to, give my soul away to
Before I lay my head down to sleep, peep the thief
When you gamble with your life, you should know you play for keeps
Situations made me trife when depend upon the streets?
It's Hell in these days that we live in

[Chorus 2X]

[Verse 4: Killah Priest]
Two kids fought in the womb
One brother will be stronger than the other
The mother, Rebecca, Isaac was the father
Abraham, the author, one white, the other slightly darker
The children, the prophecy, Genesis 25 Verse 23
The elder shall serve the younger, I heard the thunder
Passed out from hunger, plus I was thirsty, I begged for mercy
Am I worthy to be the Priest? Behold seven Greeks
I pulled my sword out my sheath
But the vision made me weak, imprisoned in the deep
My mind risen from the East, the wisdom of a Killah Priest
Now take you through 60 Sec. of the elect

[Verse 5: 60 Second Assassin]
Ahh.. a new era, I'm like raisin terror
So highly recognised, nigga die
To measure the inevitable, be on like episodes
Deadly technicals, scribes giving rise to time
Before celestial, don't beam no lyrics ever hit precise
The double sight, I take flight
Through crews, the trips of night
Spark synthetic flames, a meteorite
Seventh Heaven burst seven horn to lyrics of thunder!
And fight to strike snakes out from under
Cloudly men trip six miles of flyin myst, words of the gift
Playing for the tales of the crypt, of the dark dense senses
God's Heavenly business, count backwards, a Total Recall
Deep in an eclipse, leaving our lip stitched
You couldn't mind your business, so when it came!
Throned to this rap, you should have vacated the premises
And make way for Attilla, thriller, down low killer
Getting civil, turn back, get burned
To a pillar, fought, total loss, which way I swing from?
The East to North, two in a row, one pitcher
The Land of the Lost, on the Ave. screamin "Warpath!"
A mad cash in the stash, you can't last, a psychopath
I packs a mag. in other words a 'matic
Magnetic gift of gab, why need a jewellery when I strapped up under the booty?
Doin major damage, throwing lyrics like ceramics
With enough kicks, flush the bullshit, you could cram it
Along with the dildo, straight to your ass like a field goat
Hush! Your mouth's closed, so yo fuck all that Willie boast

[Chorus 4X]
