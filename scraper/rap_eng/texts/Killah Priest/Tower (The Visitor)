Verse I
Behold from Nibiru
The 900 souls of a pharaoh
Speaking through my lips to the ghetto
Hello
Shalom salaam
From the Om beyond
Alone from the eons
Now devil be gone
I come to talk to your presidents
Why do you have aerial defense?
I have evidence
Global dragnet space system
The World Wide Web
From Egyptians listen, vision
I talk from The Emerald Tablets from Thoth
Just rapping my thoughts
Inhabitants of the world with gravitational force
From the cabinets of Nazareth
I gathered this
Astro-theology versus Castro’s philosophies
Knowledge, eyes to see
In my afro’s astrology
The Leo, Virgo, emerge souls
Libra, the ether it gets deeper
In Scorpio, Horus shows Judas
Seems foolish?
Did Christ feed a multitude with two fish?
Pisces, I write these
Crown of thorns the sun to rule us
Before they bury us, Sagittarius, the mass of gas over areas
Capricorn, in the blackness it was formed
The Aries, Aquarius, squares in the circles fit
Virtue off my lip I spit mucus
Showing you that the future exists
(Hook)
Look through my eyes
Become solar energized
Higher powers
I am the tower travel inside
The head of the Sphinx is a woman
The body’s a lion
Transform
He who stands godly vs science
(Repeat)
Verse II
Greetings earthlings
Where herbs spring
Which dirt brings
Where birds sing
And chirp with perched wings
Deny god, prefer kings
Even England serves Queens
So how y’all searching?
To every person, man or a woman nursing
Ultimate light
The solstice bright
Focus the sight
Plague of locust from my mic
Washing my chakras
Cleansing my aura
Transcending from water
Beginnings of Torahs
The cube within the cube
The wise can pretend as a fool
But the fool cannot contend with the wise
Most High, multi-skies
Solar energize spectrums over Nephilims
Crop circle makers
Planets, strange craters
It’s just human nature
Shooting lasers sky fireworks
I’ll take you to a higher verse
This is for the babies that died at birth
What’s life worth?
(Hook Twice)
