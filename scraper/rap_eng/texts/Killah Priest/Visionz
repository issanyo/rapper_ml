[Intro]
Vision
To give you vision [x4]

[Verse]
Intervention
Life adventures
White winters
Israelite upon the night remembrance
Celebrate existence
Snowflakes take the shape of a bright empress
My cold hands reach for the princes in linen
But then there’s shoot outs
Drug wars
Liquor stores
Cops kick in the door (yo yo what up?)
Visions of war
Prison ward so high
Bodies stiff in the morgue
Drug sniffin dogs piss in the halls
They frisk us on floors
While hitting our jaws
Twisting the laws
System is flaws
Wisdom no more
Hating ourselves
Gated in hell
Overpopulated
Those that thought they made it
Still taking our wealth
Raping ourself

Pyramid falls
Into stone man lakes
Most high would call
We used to hear him from space
Mosaic laws
Appeared in our face
Angels applaud
Mothers embraced
Strangers explored
Manna we taste
Cosmic thoughts
Turn my brain into a gothic quartz
Crystal
Now Israel
Kneel before a coptic cross
God knowledge was lost
Used to be flossed
Now its nudity taught
Your beauty decoursed

Light menorahs
Recite the Torah
Anoint my head with white waters
Bright aura
Welcome to the psychic life of Walter
Israelite Christ talker
The sky walker
Faithful Gabriel angel
Husband son wife daughter
The righteous order
The sun light the moon night
Yo who’s the author
I write by torture
All so the good life can offer
Street reporter
Priest speaks to pro tools recorders

The wise man
From the highlands
Hold our wives hands
Righteous eye scan
The mind span
The tribes stand
We’re aryan
The most high’s plan
If the eye brand
Skys is tanned over the hot sands
Yo we entrepreneurs since dinosaurs
Yom Kippur
Palms on floors
On Rosh Hashanah
Love thick as a rasta’s ganja
Twelve sit in the father’s honour
Natural mist was cast upon us

The tea ceremony
The holy of holies
Sacred testimony
The trees a bodhi
The priest were bony
They pointed slowly
Showed me it was me
In Nairobi
Teepees of the Hopis
Inside it was smoky
The chief spoke ghostly
His eye was stony
The sky was snowy
The vibe was cosy
The tribe watched closely
I got at them with poetry
Culturally
Nobly
Vocally
Ultimately
Globally
Totally I flow Jehovatry

[Outro]
To give you vision
To give you vision

That’s all I wanna do…
To give you vision

To give you vision

We just vibing out…
To give you vision

Thats what we do…

That’s why we write rhymes…
To give you vision

Why we speak on the mic…
To give you vision
