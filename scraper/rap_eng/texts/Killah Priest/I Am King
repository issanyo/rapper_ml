[Intro: Killah Priest]
We do this for sport
Yeah

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
The vocal words from the prince from Persia
Silent weapons for quiet wars, expensive murder
Savage [?], snakes, half man half ape
The migration of the black space, fat lake
The [?] his own fate
Reflection eclipse on lunar
The medicine man with boxwood should have came sooner
Heavy breathing, the fox feeds on tuna
The pusher's drug, the moon lit his blood under a tree
The warrior priest bush ran spear pinpoints the deer
The armor shows his drama, the blood shows his honor
His mug show the horror, his tongue show the herb of garlic
Milk weed and seeds above the starlit
Below the prophet, the stone breeds the warrior
Golly his body submerged in garment

[Hook x2: Killah Priest]
Who am I King? Who am I Lord?
What was I a peasant? What was I a boy?
What I do pray pull me out the grave
During my journey back this is what I'll say

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
My kingdom of glory, rose as scrolls of stories
Behold 8 million eyes before me
The test of resurrection, my steps to edge of perfection
I leap into the force of winds to sounds of organs
Harps are flying dormant since God's angels are calling
Whirlwind from the orbit
Infinity runs down the vacuum wings, they crown me Black King
The hands of time push me forward
My face frosted 'til I forewarned them of the warlord
All embrace all, the sword take off limbs
Leaping through rims, the space horse
Great thoughts, if my name died, then rap is back
The psychic on a prophet, I write it, you watch it
Under clouds are dark rings strumming harp strings
I ask this question, who am I?

[Hook x2: Killah Priest]
Who am I King? Who am I Lord?
What was I a peasant? What was I a boy?
What I do pray pull me out the grave
During my journey back this is what I'll say

[Outro: sample]
Now clear your minds, it knows what scares you
It has from the very beginning
Don't give it any help, it knows too much already
