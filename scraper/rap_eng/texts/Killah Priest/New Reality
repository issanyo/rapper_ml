[Intro: sample]
Its true! It’s a tiny little planet
I leave it sometimes and travel all over the universe
I go to other galaxies and visit strange alien planets
I zoom right through things like meteor showers
And skim over black holes
It’s exciting

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Children of the lower worlds less fortunate
From the orphanage, tear drops, coffin lids
The upper world feels your pain
120.000 years of rain for the young and the slain
Your memory last for centuries
A tribute for what you been through, may your life continue
Live on on other planets where you see the great ones standing
Even though they took life for granted
It’s like the untold stories of Kelvin Martin
Investigation found the macs and volts in his apartment
The informant, mob cops, crime bosses
And cover ups, FBIs and flying saucers
Watching night watch, online love affairs and true crimes
Congregation of Masons showing new signs
Government conspiracies
The X9 hollow in the hands of this Killa Bee
Jericho flesh build walls around my mind from a speck of dust
To my exodus to the black holes to the nebulas
I hear mystic messengers in raindrops
Crack the code of the crop, my brain locks
Then slide out the chamber
Ink sprays all over the paper, the diary books of a gangster

[Break: Killah Priest]
Welcome you to the New Reality
I welcome you to the New Reality

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
No more prosecutors’ excitement remarkable federal indictments
Million dollar drug bust while thugs discuss
Mathematical enlightenment with masterful writing
Mind travel need no license, just high science
And incredible rhyming what happened to Tyson?
They killed his mind, he stopped fighting
Early eighties the man was a giant
A nightclub owner secret friends with two Columbian drug lords
They all traffickers, Saint Valentine’s Day blood massacre
The heart in my chest is the shape of Africa
My brain is lavender
Accepting calls from 9/11 plane passengers
They say they never aboard the government used remote
So let’s revolt, someone cut the cord, at night the sky ignite
What’s that falling fiery rings I am king
From higher heights I sit beyond the neon cloud
For aeon my name rings out loud the future is now
Eternal life is in the journals I write
Exit, I exist as one, there is none besides the Son
Beyond boundaries without change of movement
Only elements and ruins concealed within myself
Thoughts of a seahorse submerge deep in the cosmic water
I breathe the source of life then force planets
Small to gigantic, gave them commandments
The wings of the wind, fly by flapping across the entire atlas

FWelcome you to the new reality
