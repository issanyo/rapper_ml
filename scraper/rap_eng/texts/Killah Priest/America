[Intro: Killah Priest, Raekwon]
Continous
Yeah, youknowhatI'msayin?
Wu-Tang
Aiyyo aiyyo, come on yo yo yo I'mma shoot over here
On that AIDS thing
YouknowhatI'msayin? I'm gonna just slide in the studio quick and get this done
Yo, yo

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
When you're sexually frustrated, plus waited for a long time
You both had strong minds
Combined with feelings, she seems appealing, for each other
Discreet lover, no longer keeps rubbers
Smothered under deep covers
Erotic programs, Moet and slow jams
Enough to make you hold hands and plus you a bold man
You fall in a manhole, where the forbidden tree grow
And bullshit ego, of fly negro
Her garden sour, polluted with a dead flower
Months later, he's layin on a respirator
Depending on a generator, to keep his heart moving
And start losing sight in his right eye
In weeks he might die

[Raekwon]
I know this dope-fiend cat, word up, his name is Javier
Part-time shooter sharing needles in the stairs
Wise guys disguised as a fly guy, you getting high right?
Weeded up with red shit in your right eye
You's a menace, your brain cells finished
Begging forgiveness, calling that up top shit syphillis
You know what you was gettin into
Try to guess on what I've been through
Fuck shorty raw then she scared you

[Hook: Raekwon]
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real

[Verse 2: RZA]
My nigga Chuck, he loved to fuck
Everything exotic bitches down to ugly ducks
Like Nancy, who liked the fancy tickles so he put popsicles
On her nipples to make her sex passion triple quadriple
Until she bust
Overcome with passion, big ass want lust upon him
But nigga he forsake to grab the condom
Fuck it, he said AIDS, was government made
To keep niggas afraid so they won't get laid no babies be made
And the black population will decrease within a decade
German warfare product against the dark shade

[Hook]
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from my crew, it's real
AIDS kills, word up respect this, yo
Coming from the Wu, it's real

[Verse 3: Masta Killa]
Caught by the gravitation earth rotation
Six in the sex is deep, when you can't see clear
Through the sheer brassiere, toke back
Smoking a spliff, sippin cognac, God
You know my two love songs, Bobby Womack tracks
Got her fat ass layin flat on her back

[Inspectah Deck]
Yo, as she lay, she wore a silk gray neglige
Alize pours, the radio play, Marvin Gaye
What's Going On? As she screams Sexual Healing
Couldn't fight the feeling her legs hit the ceiling
Hitting all positions dipped in for quick love
She's professional, she does this shit in strip clubs
Flied in June until she Acquired Immune Deficiency
Now misery is the syndrome

[Outro: Raekwon and others]
Oh shit, God that's wild
Damn, that's some cherry flavor shit going on though kid
For real, knowhatI'msayin?
What about the exotic type
Caskets is waitin for brothers
Word up slide on the joints baby
Before you go to sex take protection
Word up

AIDS kills, word up respect this
America Is Dying Slowly (4x)

Yeah, word yo, sliding up in this store right here
I ain't even playing that man, for real
Dig it
Respect how I'm living kid
Here forever, word up
Lubricated joints, ribbed joints is bangin
But they still playing the hotel door man
Word, you know how that be though, you know how that be
Yo, just gettin to be too old
Chick over there lookin like Sonny and Cher
Over there
Yeah
America Is Dying Slowly
Surely
America Is Dying Slowly
America Is Dying Slowly
Remember that! Syndrome, be the resident
America Is Dying Slowly
Wu-Tang, Syndrome, be the resident
