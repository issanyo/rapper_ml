(Sample from "Some Other Time" by The Alan Parsons Project)

"In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time
It's the evening of another day and the end of mine"

[Killah Priest]
They counted me dead and finished
Though I never reached my limits
Alcohol and strange women
Soon it gave me tunnel vision
Sun will glisten in time
Humble listen for a sign
His baby mother on his mind
Stressing him for every dime
Filed divorced, while in court
She smiled across, wildest thoughts
Child support, now I lost
And I'm like "DAMN, why recourse"
Meanwhile no deal, cold meals
Flow still, it's so real

"Now the starlight which has found me lost for a million years
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes till it disappears"

[Killah Priest]
Now I got my mojo back
Listen how I flow on tracks
Priest when opposed to rap
I could never be a poster cat
Blind faith lost my way
Many times, I often pray
Walking near where coffins lay
Names on them crossing graves
Or outlined in chalk on pave
Or an entrance to a court from a cage
The highway speeding like
I'm riding a Ducati bike
Finally I can see his light
Flying through a neon night
I could see beyond sight
Like Stevie on them keys of life
Playing for my freedom right
Esau called 'em Edomites
It's rare what you perceive as white
Dreads crush there weed in pipes
The head for the meteorite
It was you that gave me power
My first baby shower till I'm pushing up daisy flowers
Pull ups for eighty hours
Running to the mountain top
Like the man on the balcony shot
Know it was planned before Malcolm dropped
He stand before them cameras pop
While his wife and family watch
Hatred of a man pray this cancer will stop

"In a matter, of a moment lost till the end of time
It's the evening of another day and the end of mine"

"Now the starlight which has found me lost for a million years
Tries to linger as it fills my eyes till it disappears"
