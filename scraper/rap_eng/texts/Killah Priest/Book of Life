[Intro]
Damn Priest there's more?
Ya'kno'man
There's more man? Priest
You still gon' at it?

[Chorus] (x2)
So look at life, where will it take us?
Into the lights, stay strong and don't break up
Band together, the strength and unity
Be strong and live longer, this is not ya eulogy

[Verse 1]
Dearly beloved we gather here to celebrate life
Peace to Empuls he found my wife
May y'all never depart, I reach deep into my heart
Pull out every foul thing I've done
Where my eyes browse upon my son
Remember y'all the one so listen
Got a third part, which is the best part
So when you get out in the world the game of chess starts
Remember concentrate before you make a move
Deal with the truth in ya square
And remember God is in you
So you don't have to search outside the Earth
Just go inside this verse, plant the seeds in ya mind
Watch it grow high as a turf
Just look around - remember you are the Church

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Victory is yours if you lead of course
End all, make sure you know what ya end is for
Remember every seed is pure, military wants you
The cemetery will taunt you if you let it
Help you escape the hands of the medics
Perfection and this message
You my sons, my reflection
And this is a deep lesson if you keep stressing
Will bring about a deep depression
The only answers is your friends in a weed session
Look read a Proverb a day, observe life's survey
Think of my grandma in the words should say..
"Don't run down the halls" Now she's joined with the Lord
Walking down the halls, bless it the all
People rise, some fall, stand tall
Y'all gon' be the next leaders
Ecclesiastes, the words of the preacher
Hear the teacher

[Chorus]
