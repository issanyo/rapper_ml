[Intro: sample of 'Inhabited Worlds']
Each unit of the ascendant life is a veritable training school that the stage of existence just ahead
A school which is attended by ascending mortals until their translation to the regime of the superuniverse and the attainment of spirit existence

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
I hear nothing in the halls of gods
See me walking on floors of stars
Paintings on walls so large
A sea of orbs and stone citrine from the planet of Mars
As history takes my hand
Leads me to a victorious land, down ladders that spiral
Resembles the helical strands
Of DNA or Jacob's ladder or the pineal gland
Beyond Pluto, saw the hidden places, the creations of new globes
As we travel I look at 9 like whoa
As we ascend into the divine abode
3 billion 6 hundred and 80 million miles away from the Sun
Divine clouds open up, my density comes
And with it, its kings from off every planet
Trillions keep coming while the rest is standing
We stood enchanted, I spoke first
"I represent the planet Earth, my place of birth"
There was silence around the Universe
For a time and times to come

[Hook: Killah Priest]
"You're in the galleries of the gods
Amongst the legends, in their presences from galaxies of afar
Kishar, Melchizedek, Enoch, Ishtar
Moses, the man from Nazareth, Khufu and Set
The Merkavah Machael and Gabriel
Abel, Adam and Seth
Gallery of the gods
Amongst the legends in their presences from galaxies of afar"

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I said "I am the king of dark words
That put rhymes together in proverbs"
Again they said nothing, they just observe
Then the silence broke, one spoke and said that we're honored
Well done, now welcome the lord of lyrics
They all applaud as I'm standing in my over spirit
It's ultra mystic, travelling through our bodies
Are lightning bolts and blizzards
They said, "Come, we'll build an upper room in the place
And spread a roof in the black silence
We'll call this place your rap Island
Where you'll be writing rhymes forever and making albums"

[Hook: Killah Priest]
You're in the galleries of the gods
Amongst the legends, in their presences from galaxies of afar
Kishar, Melchizedek, Enoch, Ishtar
Moses, the man from Nazareth, Khufu and Set
The Merkavah Machael and Gabriel
Abel, Adam and Seth
Gallery of the gods
Amongst the legends in their presences from galaxies of afar

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
The day I was thrusted to the councillorship
They shown my cinematic clips
Proto-Sinaitic scripts, enigmatic words of magic and hieroglyphs
There were people and tongues in tribals and cliques
The empirical contemporaneous data from black matter
That hammered the ring in the heavens
They said, "Your being will be a rap legend"
I got power, picture rottweilers running up the watch tower
Into the omnipresence, my cinema
My brain is a replica of Nineveh
The heavenly body produced the celestial body
At high rates produced the terrestrial copies
All up and down Ur, through the Nile valleys
Up in Kish to the land of Mali
Decorate the temples with Walter Reed's initials
His writings and epistles all through the gods' galleries
Emotionally paralyzed as the pharaohs died
Dogmatic, unable to see beyond rules
Grip closely on doctrine is not cool
They can't agree to disagree
They don't discuss, they attack
A-alike attracts
Do not choose to proceed to understand the world
Disconnected as their souls were hurled
They copy the ideas
And take credit without contributing new things
They are addicted to hype and conspiracy evils
Emotionally paralyzed when the pharaohs died
Gallery of kings, description archeology Odyssey
