[Killah Priest]
Y'all niggas thought that I quit the game?
Thought you seen the Stonehenge tomb stone, inscript my name thought you saw all of the Ice wit Cube
Nah I'm equipped wit flames, mummified in Gucci, I live again
Abominated my body wit all y'all hate
(Abominated my body wit all y'all hate)
Dress me in a suit of negative thoughts of all the fake
The caretaker places a smile on my face
Then threw me in the pit, that's it
He made his glory in '98 but now it's 840
He gave his story, but above his grave it was stormy
Which made the dirt to kick muddy
It's about to get ugly, trust me
Thirteenth day, unlucky, fuck me, nah fuck you!!!
Dust move from off his cloth
He begins to cough then begins to talk, I am rough
840 Babylon, then he smatch his palms through the coffin
The comin' of his second Offering
There was no death so there is no mournin'
(There is no death so there is no mournin')
His second Stained Glass see his hand pushin' through the grass
Yeah, see the sand slippin' through the glass
The Reaper held a sickle for that ass
I prepared you a plate of violence
The quiet surround ya grave with violins
Be afraid of goblins to resurrect again is my greatest challenge
Before I fell, I cast you in Angels in the Hell
His skull is fire, his horse is pale
In the soul of this writer, his force is a dwell
I'm the abomination you're facin'
My rhymes conjure Satan in an armor of caveman's
The final conflict awaitin'
And my palm grips the ink wavin'
Inside me is fiery, hundred eyes of the P
I'ma split altar inside of a broken tabernacle of slaughter
The threshold for dead souls
I finish ruins of castles in the Soviet Union
Y'all love death, y'all married my anger
Y'all played Russian Roulette, y'all souls is the wager
Who wanted, I'm comin' for all y'all
And after I kill ya, I'ma walk through the graveyard with a shovel like the Devil
Dig up your skeleton and grind it 'til there's more evidence
Then take your powder to my residence
Open up a dutch, sprinkle the dust
Then light the shit up and take a gigantic motherfuckin' puff
(And take a gigantic mothafuckin' puff)

[Outro: sample]
Ah, mama sure is cool and I thought we was tight
We is tight but if you ain't got no quarter you can't get in
Ah man, come on man
Party ain't nothing anyway, don't wanna come in
