[Intro: Killah Priest, (Tekitha), [Killah Priest in background of his intro]]
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
KP, [Killah Priest] Iron Sheik
In these times we gotta take one step [Prodigal Sunn] forward [Hell Razah, Royal Fam]
Put one foot in front of the other [Dreddy Kruger], my brother
Yo, check this out

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Early natives related to thrones of David
Captured by some patriots and thrown on slave ships
They stripped us naked while their wives picked they favourite
Lives were wasted in the hands of the hated
Driven from the garden
Now we starving in the modern day Sodom, they call it Harlem
Worldly problems got us at the bottom
The Earth crisis and the righteous grab their ice picks
Seekers like us for our rices, I stay in ciphers
Our life is connected to second son of Isaac
Which had a tight grip on the heels of his brother, revealed to his mother
"The elder should serve the younger," words heard in thunder
Down from under, rose and fled to grow in hunger
Now it's cold in summer, the soldier slumbers, behold a number
600, 6 and 3 score
The same as Esau, who ate his meat raw
In the time before they climbed aboard a dinosaur
Information held behind the doors
We came from the atmosphere, the physical trapped us here
Then they gave us crack and beer
In the back of the stairs, please adapt your ears
Add or subtract the years
And form the unwise and watch the sunrise from sunset
None slept, one flesh, one breath

[Hook: Hell Razah, (Tekitha)]
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Devil's marveled, they caught us playing with the gold marbles
We wrote novels, now we live life in the bottle
Before the Devil sold me to the unholy
He called my father Toby, I live life amongst the lowly
The President just ordered the Navy to hit the borders of Haiti
Slaughtered babies from the waters of Euphrates
Maybe they sent germs that polluted our sperm
And made us live uncircumcised in the serpent eyes
And told us certain lies and each day a servant dies
But in the halls of Pharaoh, the walls are narrow
And religion is like a prison for the seekers of wisdom
Now Freedom, let's feed 'em, feed 'em
They took the first book of Jacob to Jamaica
Promised us 40 acres and a mule
Treated like an animal, understand the jewel
Brought to the 50 States
Deuteronomy 28, Verse 68, it all relates
1555 is when we first arrived
We tell jokes with some get high and watch the fish fry

[Hook x2: Hell Razah, (Tekitha)]
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)
One Step, One Flesh, One Breath
(Your arms too short to box with God...)

[Outro: Tekitha]
One step, one, one step, step
One, one flesh, one, one step
One, one breath
One step, one step
