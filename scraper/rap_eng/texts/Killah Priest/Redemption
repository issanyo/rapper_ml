[Killah Priest]
Boast not against the natural branches
But if thy boast thou bearest not the good root
That the Lord has planted
You who will rule the planet
For if the first fruit be holy
The lump is also holy
The roots and the whole tree
And thy will grafted in amongst them
Being while olive trees
I'm looked at your trunks stem
I see the strange fruit hiding in your leaves
A dollar tree, trick-knowledge is their policy
My souls be set on fire
I rose from the depths from liars
Breath of Elijah
Never the less be full of joy and comfort
To the worldly things and out with things and conquered
Strange women and parties and alcohol
I devour them all
And gave 'em back when I heard my call
Cause I felt you there
You had my back when no one else cared
It's like a flare burning in mid air
All I could do is stare
I feel something in my system
It's more than a rhythm
It's just a voice calling me back to redemption
I'm walking over heated coals
Like Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
This life's eternal, I write my journal
If y'all could feel this
Feel something touching my spirit
I see the clearest that I ever seen
This must be what heaven means

(Chorus) Priest
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
Hallelujah
This is my redemption
Hallelujah
This is my redemption
Hallelujah
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption

[Killah Priest]
Name till I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And my buckles where my barrels is kept
But I don't need it anymore, it's pure
Devotion I saw, I'm hoping he open this door
Remember not to transgression of my youth
But witness my grand presence; God made me new
The patience, the aching, the praying
Long suffering, the dedication, the new creation
To my adversaries that I would have buried
It's not necessary, the old things become new
And this is true, straight out the blue
My spirit is renewed
Out of body experience what's my options?
The adoptions, the glory, the covenant
The giving of his judgment, the government
The service, the promise, and the fathers
And that shall cover it for Israel

(Chorus) Priest
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
Hallelujah
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
Hallelujah
This is my redemption
Hallelujah
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
And the angel sung
This is my redemption
And the angel sung

[Killah Priest]
Having to abolishing their flesh, amity
And the Lord has slained all my enemies
I live for centuries
All of them make mockery of the prophecies
That's the devil's psychology
I'm on top while they bottom feed
No longer strangers and foreigners
But fellow citizens of his lineage
Ghettos missing this
I can not peak, why? Cause the Lord have no limits

(Jeni Fujita w/ Priest)
The meek shall inherit the Earth
And the rich will perish with her
And the Saints will rejoice over her
When she's swallowed up under the Earth
For the meek shall inherit the Earth
And the rich will perish with her
And the Saints will rejoice over her
When she's swallowed up under the Earth
