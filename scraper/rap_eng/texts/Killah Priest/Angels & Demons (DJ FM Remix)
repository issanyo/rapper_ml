(Verse 2:Sick Jacken)
Shall gangsters on the curb
A rap meant to street vengeance
Hieroglyphs on the wall tell who  leave fences
That's why we lost angels feel like we need penance
Right there on Union between seven, deep tendance
While life is short but death is endless
????????????????????????????????????
Heart cold like New-York winters
That’s why we walk with heat
Temperature drops as you work on triggers
I’ve been Master of Ceremonies
You can give it on me
I got soul cause i deal with spirit only
You wanna fuck with this ?Bring it on me
I got a mark of Sick, platoon ink the brand on me
Whole Sick Side hangin' on me
My brother paralyze but we got movement to carry homie
My rhyme rebellion is mind ghrelin
My pin fame drip venom in to lines
That telling-street life is to see the light
Scenes of light
We got harmony with scenes i write
The only peace is that one on my head
The one that i spit with
My words are bullets and audio clips
The streets are filled with radios cliques
I don’t know how we exist
We are in food chain on top of the list
You’re eyes blind just choke design art with rhyme
My words are gospel of violent time
