[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
You an android something that my hands destroyed
The feds built you I'm a push you into a asteroid
Then hole till you turn into the black noise
The super God has no time for you Wrap Boyce
Go head rap about how much money you got
How many guns you shot, how much jewelry you rock
Go head act it ALAN just stand here and WATT
I'm still not impressed The Rhymes mean cruddy special-effects
Now watch the bodies I catch
And I'm a take you apart in the valley of death
Are you a man or robot, open his face just like a post box
Body swell shots a Botox
The beast sit over the city like co-ops
Kids slam dance to Biggie with mohawks
The missiles to Mars attack of the gods
The cat people found the math to the stars
The wizard of Oz The Land of Nod
Noble Drew Ali Master Farad i'm back on my job
My writing is pure de ospa, street opera part film noir
A French movie about gods in war, a Greek lexicon the gout amos                                                                   medieval African poets during the sau
Walking the labyrinth looking for the amethyst
Nuwaupians returning from planet rizq                                                               grad donkey y'all can flee into a Mammoth ship
They called em evangelist plus the philanthropist
In the catacomb Beneath the gravel and stone
Lives'll ruin supercities that battle for thrones
A Pharaoh unknown I'll unravel his bone
I saw a gold microphone in the master of poems
A castle disowned jumped into a time capsule alone
Flew to a current time stood up in a Tabernacle fully grown Build
Rhymes like The old macks old Tex I zone castles with chandeliers
With my enemies hands and ears all over the dome I inhale a universe exhale a super verse that foretold
The coming galaxies and the future Earth i call it my home
The new graffiti is the Kundalini kool herc girls with Wu bikinis

(Chorus)
"I destroyed you in an island called berzerk x8"

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
The scenery apocalyptic 0 Dialogue just Heroes with firearms
Empires of the gods The fighter from the star
The might of the saw he light a cigar star day cap is long
The MC from the breeze from the Big Bang galaxies
Far as the eye can see the bit range
All hail the man with the swift rain
A scientist with a thick frame destroying the planet
Rappers cliffhang NY they keep dangling
While I crack they rib cage pass me the mic like a hand grenade i'm much different then the man you played
You barely breathing like the last cancer stage
And your rhymes are disturbing
Look how many eight-year-old you have to twerking
And it ain't real when people out here Hurt
Throw on the operating table close the curtains
Face the surgeon whats wrong too many Molly's probably
You got the kids dream about Bugatti's
It's no longer illuminati it's the illuMennazi's
Robot world cartoons of parties
So if a biuld you I'm gonna take you apart
They give you a brain I'm taking your heart
If they build you a wall i'm putting up art
A clud all this nasa David types
Stomp his compressor and megabytes
Take out his conductor destroy his framework
Reactors shut off can't talk his senses are lost
The beast killed the chief of finance on top of a power plant
The towers in France caught signals
Original digital beam from the planet of God
I'm living proof I bet his eyes has sparks
No where to go in the ocean women taiga Shark
Greatest of all time got writers block
He ate the whole rhyme up the finest watch
The type business like quiet professional
Mature but un pure skeptical more vulgar lil older
Chain-smoker the games over he takes yoga I destroyed you

(chorus)
" I destroyed you in an island called berzerk x8"
