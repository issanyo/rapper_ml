[Verse 1]
My crown of glory, you rappers y'all bore me
Seven billion stories, angels kneel before me
I build it for majority, seniority, I photography
Prophecy, my bread conceal maturity
The one man that's more than everyone, minority
I stare in the mirror and see infinity
Deep entities, galaxies and planets
A king leading infantry, I see immortals
Majestic, since boar head - the Caesar
The afros, the cornrows
I'm blessed with more flows
Just accept it, no homo
The holder of the rainbow and the volcano
Flows both fierce and precious
My garment alike, these are bar mitts I write
Like the Bar Mitzvah of Christ
Hare Krishna when I'm holding mics
Behold when I spit a sight
Israelite, I could spit death and hell
Dead body's skeletons inside a cold cells
Or the ringer of Church bells
The breaker of spells, the healer
Hopes life is well, the Killah
My raps come out of a shell
The pen hits, my mind click
Tongue led off hot nails
Crucifix, Judas' pix, you wanted to flow
The lifestyle, what if I had doe?
Y'all wanted the gold and all the ice now
I write down, what if I was rich?
None of y'all wouldn't exist
I'm convinced my son is a prince
Under my skin is wonder of men
Kingship, wings sprout pass the genes
Cover my clips; I'm strapped with mac-10's
That murder y'all demons

[Verse 2]
The suffering poet, the ladder to Imhotep
From the grave of Joseph, the journey like Moses
The mercy of Jehovah, thou requirements
From my higher intelligence, from my wars in heaven
The Lord is my Shepherd, born again
Draw my weapon, days of longing
Strong within, over grave that's storming
I descend and sit in my throne
Out of hells catacomb, the ladder of stones
The castle, I prepare my rhythm and poems
Take off these chains, Priest speaks 700 names
No one is the same, until redemption
My rhyme concealment to the time of revealing
Intertwine, smell the hemp scent
Smoke the weed that's growing in my thoughts
I stand next to the Pale Horse
The captive emcee, the sleeping prophet
Rappers forcing the end, calling on the comet
Rhymes are atomic from out of God's department
Topic, my head is the cave of four winds
The plague, I draw with the pen
Armaged' I saw with my lens
I stand in front of you all
Divided by a Red Sea walls
Look ahead I see shores
Walter Reed, peace, I endure
There, where there's no vacant place or an empty place
Gases avoid, I started with the one thought asteroid
Eye lids open up, solar flux, burdens uncoiled
In this formless mind, the asteroids erupt
The small rocks blew up into dust

[Verse 3]
I said to my son, my son said to me
That we gather my beam, behold I am the three
The trinity, the words said to myself, let us form a rhyme
My spirit moved across my mind
We debated for days with wordplays
And the word became flesh when I entered the text
Enter my page thru no sex
The rap conception, immaculate
My rap's to die for, the lost lessons
Crucified the rhyme, to rise in three minutes
A new sentence was invented
My rap's adventure is endless
My poetry is strong, my art's pure
But my heart and my rap is relentless
Not to get religious but these rhymes are pictures
Vivid as Black August or historical scriptures
For listeners and visionists
From the carving of the rhymes talk
Awakens an ancient force
Imprisoned in my poem's source
Zone, no limit in the realms of thought
Unborns must die
Loosen up the saddle of the ghost horse galloping in the sky
Divinity track lucky seven, infinity's back
God codes been broke, now the memory's zapped
