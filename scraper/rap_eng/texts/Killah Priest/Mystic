[Intro: Killah Priest]
Beyond divine intellect
Yeah, spotted
The almighty Priest
Body, it's Priest that's gave body, thirteen

[Killah Priest]
Priest the goblin, the yellow, streets be robbin'
I'm throbbin', into my head, we move in cobwebs
You see a large bed filled with holage
Just do the knowledge, remind them
Sit down, their palms are red, I'm the Mystic
Black finger nails, blue lipstick
Who is this? You hear music in the background
You see backs and hear sounds, your trapped now
You see wolves and blood hounds
You the big bear in the hood and still a thug now
I'm turnin' the streets into graveyards
We lay them in cages, the eons left precise in clay jars
Put 'em in tombs with mummies, and foreign countries
Slept under the stars monthly, I'm starvin', hungry
I pray to God on one knee
Explodin' quasars confront me
In the heavens I'm one legend, peace to Genie
Many Shieks have seen me, many gypsies are misty
Present from the Pharoahs themselves
Share their myths in pyramids
Late wives bein' curious, my spirit lives
Forseen sectors from my ancestors
Burried beneath the sand treasures
You should know I'ma one legend

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
I inherit this jewel, never sit with a fool
Never eat with no booze, they'll poison ya food
Who in ya ?, enter the room
That main body shit rule
I inherit this jewel, never sit with a fool
Never eat with no booze, they'll poison ya food
Who in ya ?, enter the room
That main body shit rule
That main body shit rule

[Killah Priest]
Turn into King Tut when my ink touch the paper
I seen images of Asia, had visions of saviours
In the ghettoes the Devil's painting is that of serpant
Who does he worship, better serve us or turn to dust
I bug out like I'm smokin' a bomb
I seen niggas in coat of arms
Vikings, Knights, Kings the sky's brightenin' from lightenin'
Angels give me white wings to fly away
In Heavens hotter ways, night turns to day
Back to darkness over the projects
The Indians fear and clap calm 'til they bodies dead
And wings come out their back bone and they flap home
Crack thrones with King's slumped bodies over
Killed by my soldiers I've told ya

Chorus

[Outro: Killah Priest]
Bodies baby, 2002
Give it to 'em
Get away, the guns'll spray
