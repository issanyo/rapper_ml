(Chorus) 2x
I'm the rose and I give this to you
It tears my clothes and this life's so crucial
Prepare the road and my ride's in neutral
Beware of my soul cause my eyes see through you

And my eyes see through you
And my eyes see through you

[Killah Priest]
Love and happiness, drug and marriages
Slugs from the ratchet spit
Secrets of the dead when that casket lift
Bullets left to pull bastard stiff
Mix messages, rich heritage
I come form the Hyksos araget
Six thousand miles through the strong currents
We survive with endurance
Made it through the waves, kid
Outrageous, put in cages
Slaves for ages
Something out of the Bible pages
What made our survival contagious?
Its tribal, species endangered
The rose with the cuts on his clothes
His pedals had fallen in the ghetto
Crowds echo, screams and I've seen the devil
Angels with the same clothes

(Chorus) 2x

[Killah Priest]
Is it the seven in the crescent?
The G in the compass?
Reverend and his message?
It's me in a conflict
Star David - The Mosque or The Masons?
God or the Atheists?
Tomorrow are the ancients
Which way do I go? Which ways do I roll?
New age or the old?
Ways of the crow to the grave in the cold
Or to the grave in the soul with the sun-rays and I can grow
To the pavement in the road
God dealt with Nations so I deal with concentration
So deep in conversation
I reap for combination
Read Psalms when I'm shaking
Call moms when I'm aching
Push your palms when you praise him
My calm words drop bombs on Satan
Farrakhan's congregation
Escaping the longs arms of the state pens
Abomination taxes, television distractions
Her religion is backwards
Asking were they in these chapters?
Will it end with the rapture?
Or will we assail with the master?
Will the devil be captured?
Will the rebels have laughter?
Or will the ghettos be after?
From the baby showers to the grave with the flowers

(Chorus) 2x
