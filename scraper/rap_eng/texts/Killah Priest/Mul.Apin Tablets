What you see in the planet?
The stars?

VERSE I
A crew sent, investigate the silence from a planet
Inhabited by the angels of Atlantis
What they discovered was each other
A band of brothers and sisters
That resemble themselves
Chemtrails
But their skin bare fins and scales
A new beautiful world
A digital heaven
Nine crystal moons and suns that formed a rainbow seven
The scientist took notes of their sector
While the astronauts recorded it in their records
On board was a crew of doctors and professors
That took pictures for their lectures
What happens next is disastrous
The land and crew was destroyed by an asteroid
Only two survivors a man and a woman
The man was from the crew
The woman was from the planet
That didn't see the asteroid coming
She kneeled down and draws in the sand
So he can understand
She said her people called that land Idan
And that her name was Eva from a planet called Urt
His face full of dirt he just smirked
He said we'll name this planet after yours, then he pause
He get on his knees, then he draws
He said his name was Utam
She said Utam, he said Eva
Then the hug between a tree of Keter

HOOK
Mulapin tablets
A helical rising
Dates back to the gods before Osiris
Equatorial path of Anu
The digital rivers that came
Out of the garden before Emmanuel

VERSE II
According to black scholars like Rudolph Windsor
Said black Jews were all up and down the African peninsulas
Bobby Hemmitt said it was probably Kemet
So thier hair, make-up and the robes they wore
We proudly mimic
Now an out of body experience
Let's talk about the kings of Mali
Like Sundiata that means Lion King
Yeah so Judah had rulers through Ghana
Angola, Euphrates, Ethiopia up the Nile streams
The black Madonna at the Czech Republic
It's worshipped by the popes they kiss it and they rub it
They have to touch it
So the ebony women you have to feel something
They change the faces of Queen Kahina
I guess they didn't want the African features over Medina
They couldn't change the faces of Makeda
The queen of Sheba
That made Solomon faint when he seen her
But that was a trick, he had to think before he breed her
Alexander the Great
Desire was to make his own race
Eurasian
After the invasion of the Asians
He put his troops in all nations
And after the pillage he starts raping
Whose monument's the oldest?
Let's do the dates through water erosions
Who's the Arthur of Moses?
Ahmose?
The god is the closest
The start of the poets

HOOK

VERSE III
We the same niggas with different options
See I still pick cotton
But only when I'm at Macy's shopping
And I might pick up some silk too
But that's only for my boo
'cause she says "I'm so into you"
Fossils of the elongated skulls
Is found near Senegal
See these people was here before the Mesopotamians
They had long craniums
