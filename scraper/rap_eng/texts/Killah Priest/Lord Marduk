[Intro: Killah Priest]
Yeah, Killah Priest the Iron Sheik
Moon Cricket, yeah, like I said
There is no beginning no ending to this rhyme
This Kingdom Rap

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
When I brainstorm, power outing
Flash light flickers, showers cells, devour the trails
Like thunder I’m under the spell
Rain dance, thoughts splash take a glance
I’m in a trance, note words across my pad
Until the meteorite ignite, strike the paper
Then I write over some human nature
Zigzag lightning, frightening, white wings
Left hemisphere of the brain, through my thought glass
See the forecast, try to explain, the weather man
With letters I can do anything I want
Put together interviews, it becomes cloudy
Then I can’t see the boundaries
The rain drops of these ink blots
Won’t stop till I paint art
Of thunder rolls into a scroll

[Break: Killah Priest]
The first chapter. Number 1
Number 2. There’s no beginning no end. Alright

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Ancient villages, lived a man of Gilgamesh
Pre-dates the pyramids, wrote from clay cylinders
Deeper than Homer and The Iliad, Enkidu
Welcome to the wise man and the idiot
Before synagogues, before incense and mosques
There were Demigods, men from stars
Sent from the wonderland of Oz
Nebuchadnezzar, Nimrod, built towers of Ur
Been heard Aristotle blunted the herbs
"Let there be light" God under those words
From Atom to Adam to Atum, life begin in the womb
The cradle, the casket, the crater
To other planets, the Sun and the moon
From Neanderthals to cannonballs
To Moses stood on the rock
The burning bush, returning to Kush
From worlds now and worlds to come
Not found in no books, no hook
Seven Tablets of Creation

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
The black king sits, wearing a hat with the wing disk
Ashes from the Phoenix, Supreme Genius
Saw myself in a million dreams killing Philistines
Brilliant King, Brazilian Queen on my arm
Y'all catch fire, liars like Cilvaringz
Forgive me but this is napalm
Call me Marduk from Stardust
A new attribute according to my Pharaoh suits
Priest celestial counterparts, removes his ship
This is it, the zoo from the cliff

[Break: Killah Priest]
Mercilless
This is Gebu sight chess boxing, your move
Yeah, Rhyme theory

[Verse 4: Lord Fury]
We’re under power movements
Dominant on continents
Hard like a stiff ya nigga
Soft like an impotent
Magnificent, blackness, your high excellence
Got mad power, so keep your dead presidents
The highest level, pray to Imhotep epoch soul rebel
Tamed men Tasmanian devils
What better, to be a wise man or a fool?
I’m wise, but I can play the role of a fool
Fuck school, unless you learn the lessons of life
Don’t piss against the window, fuck your friends wife
On a roll like dice, I poker before twice
Ya never saw me or sold for a small price
General Idi Amin Dada
I kill traitors, close your mouth, level lever
Blood diamonds cause violence, code of silence
We need international African alliance
To make life more better, with more cheddar
Times are getting redder, and I’m a go getter
So where the loot, cave dweller, with Ogallala
My fist sniffs your beats and your a capellas
Amazing like grace, my sweet sounds embrace
By the millions and millions from my race
The new deadly doers, so now you know lugging
I slug Batman, yo Priest come robin

{Outro: Lord Fury]
I am the Angel Gabriel, with my brother Michael
We are responsible for the destruction of Sodom & Gomorrah
Any weaker conception must have the celestial correction
Annunaki. Annunaki. Annunaki
