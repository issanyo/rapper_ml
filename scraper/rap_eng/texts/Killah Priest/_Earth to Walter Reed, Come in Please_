[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Transplanet contact not found on the map
Signs of life here, there's water in gaps
This place is light years but still is intact
Y'all have no idea, there's an oasis with tracks
Space fighting gear in case this place is a trap
But its gorgeous just saw a plant called a capsella
Pyrola vulgaris flora inside an interdimensional forest
That's surrounded by a diamond orbits
I need an ancient dictionary corpus
To decipher the writings on stone so enormous
The Prometheus new world with lithium orotate
Coordinate with love, fire, air, water, they swirl
The foundation is jasper, sapphire, emerald and pearl
Mystic waterfalls where milk wash over pearls
Where Amethyst and Moldavite is gathered by squirrels
Where image birds flies over the Merkaba that twirls
I am all and all is one, many more shall come

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Come up to the Cosmos, enter into the divine abode
Reconnect the codes
In a cage that echoes from the darkest night
The Blackest Sun, the house is the soul

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Our ancestors made bricks come down to build pyramids like Tetris
Telekinetic, writing ambidextrous in their lectures
When I'm rhyming it's esoteric
Actual facts Mt. Everest, 29,141 feet high
What's the weight of the sky? The actual length and size
All I know is that I can't fit in it when I rhyme
I'm about this high, use your mind for measurement
I'm about to give you an estimate
Use the scribes for testaments
When I spit it's either a polar shift or a solar eclipse that's it
So when I write I breathe the breath of life into the Tree of Life
Chop meat like the Edomite
So raise your fist for your freedom rights
I visit like the Rizqiyians visit Nigerians
Or Reptilians visit Native Indians
The Abyssinians visit the Caribbeans
Priest is rapping so let's visit the Millennium
Black Europe, I sit like Justinian
Stationary, the ability to maintain body equilibrium

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Come up to the Cosmos, enter into the divine abode
Reconnect the codes
In a cage that echoes from the darkest night
The Blackest Sun, the house is the soul

[Ad-lib: Killah Priest]
