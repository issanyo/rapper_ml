[Shanghai the Messenger]
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Just not need a friend, now I yearn it every day
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Was it the blind then, the blinded goat, then follow the pig
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Jus not need a friend, now I lurk in the gutters (Watch this!)
If you blind then, the blinded goat and then follow the pig

[Bridge: Shangahi the Messenger]
Since the dawn of day, men be usin they minds
To do, wickedness, but ain't nothin changed
My God, things are still the same
So I got on my knees and prayed
Lord, oh Lord, above, shine on us, your previous love
That is what we need today, that our flocks won't go astray
Cuz some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing

[Verse: Killah Priest]
Shock waves...
Now after survivin brothers connive and some smoke the lie
Sendin vibes like they shocks, I recognize
Then inspect the eyes when I detect the lies
I analyze standin wise in my enterprise
I judge wisely, as if nothin ever surprise me
Loungin between elevators and lobbies
Pockets knotty, full of Bills like Cosby
Smooth as Isley's, Brothers
No time for lies in your alibis
This style'll have you die, evil multiply
The snake slivers, plus the bite is bitter
They play you like the fiddler
The truth makes you sicker, June 4th put me on cause
351 bought off the third son, the rain drives plate of drums
I use the truth to overcome, a soldier from the slums
Call Solomon, Rudy is like a ruby to me
Zaria is like a sapphire, teach her daily
Words are clearly, yearly come near me
I prepare thee for the future, future
Tribulations and liberation, for ya nations
Killah Priest keeps it deep, plus the slogan
Wolf in sheep clothing

[Chorus 2X: Shanghai the Messenger]
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
Some of dem are wolf in, sheep clothing
[Killah Priest]
Shock wave ... shock wave!
I face the east in my place of peace
And wicked men divide sin
They have a zil, but lack the will
So they kill rather then build, a fed
Too many brothers die, while the mothers cry
And in the White House, are names are being wiped out
I got the right route, I hold a tablet, control the savage
Like I'm Moses, brains thick as water hoses
Starve the devil like a bed of roses
And use dogs to sick 'em, while the TV noise will trick 'em
Exploit our victims, while the rich applauds the system
But I'm the sheep in wolf clothing, only feats if the hoofs cloven
Priest explosion...

[Chorus]
