The streets, the Lord of Hosts and a portal for ghosts
Born to be immortal face buried in mountains of coke
We sail 100 winters, Black Fridays and 12 storms
The wind hurls on through heron(heroin) we bare arms
The beast is updated, no ancient Babylon just a computer that skeets lasers, a freak of nature stole our peace replaced our street
With gangsters no longer 666
Its 9 digits, mind physics, defined eurythmics, scene fiction
Psycho glyphics
The news is now Youtube, every eye glued survival statans the God of the new bible, the lake of fire revivals, graven idols, Obamas Moses, a red sea of refugee solders, the crucifixion of the old Jehovah that blew out millenniums and rolled Jeeps over, The skys beige today the color of that dead mans skin is grey, breathe life in em, stand up come out of them graves the young hood daughters that that hold the kings forbes keep turning stay in your orbit, they like the diamonds, anklets, baguettes reflect, but its Yah light thats truly shining

Lord of the netherworlds a wasteland, necklace holds the devils pearls, angels sexing every girl, birthed the giants from space they were hurled to earth, 2000 year curse, Sarah Palin pagans, McClain
The black clouds are hailing Martins death that day the sun was Jezebel earrings, 1000 years of reigning, the microchip phones, prince of the ghetto, the devil is home, no love perching miracles, gramma bills are medical the star place alphabetical, seductive how the devil moves, black jack, race horses and lotto tickets, borrowed riches time, its like the bottle listens, politicians, drug bakeries since 83, Crack agencies on 6 floors, Thugs bodies stiff in morgues, bullet clips in store, God chariot flies from one end of the universe to the other in the blink of an eye, Gods throne is a part of that chariot, For every ghetto Jesus theres a Judas Iscariot, palm readers reading the tarot scripts, psychopathic bliss, my mathematics is sick

The devils big foot sasquatch, the paper money is cyclops, the pyramid i watch, every hand that buys in shops i want nike size 13 in high top, so i can sport em for all the girls on my block, funny thing is when i got there, all i saw were strange stares and plain gear, stitches across everyones brains under their hair, young affairs, they say that we all in Gods prisons for hard living, coated bar system, stomachs bloated, with facial scars, and heart conditions, sine the Mamodees created the monsters, invaded the youngsters, Made it to conquer, made the homon cloous(possibly homunculus), Roman God, Zeus bow, Lighting rods amongst the giant stars, I am God, so please dont come too close, The Elohim use the power of dreams to devour our kings, Gandis birthday, Planted lotus flower by streams, Blue Tea, show my son natures truest beauty, under each arm i carry 18,000 worlds from beyond, in my mouth is the song of zion, on my back is the black madonnas icon, the CIA got secret coverage of me on the mothership, stole the files downloaded to the public in clips, footage of Brooklyn lift off, and the hood spins as you see you later, power equality, Allah sees everything around me
