[Intro: Killah Priest]
Bring it back, back, back
Allah sees everything

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Allah sees everything, everything
Allah sees everything, everything
Allah sees everything
Allah sees everything

[Bridge: Killah Priest & P.R. Terrorist]
In the eyes of God all's being seen
From young kingpins to crack fiends
Through the ears of God all's being heard
So look, listen and observe

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Allah sees everything, everything
Allah sees everything, everything
Allah sees everything, everything
Allah sees everything

[Verse 1: P.R. Terrorist]
Master thought, inaudible to palms, swing your magic wand
Disarm ya firearm when my palm dislocate your arm
Hear the sirens flee the scene calm, through the eyes of God
I reside in modern day Vietnam
Filled with young minds designed to be curious
Soldier where's your warpaint? Situation getting serious
New cops and Glocks, government issue new positions
To take the gods off the Earth, is what the Devil's wishing
You won't last with religion, it deals with division, Allah's all
United we stand son, divided we fall
Throw a mic through a stage floor and hear the crowd roar
Pandemonium, Killarm' selling out in stores
Alcoholic beverages, white boys sweating from their pores
Screaming, "Hip-Hop is what we're living for"

[Hook: P.R. Terrorist]
Allah sees everything, everything
Allah sees everything, everything

[Verse 2: Islord]
Aiyo, aiyo, what's today's mathematics? Son, you can't quote?
You get your throat chopped by the sword I possess in my palms that's coming down like napalm bombs that cause explosions
Now you frozen, thirty-two below the equator
Cause you savor, the flavor that the God branded on ya dome
With the microphone, that's multiple like a lifesaver
Coming from all angles that hit ya pressure points
And ya joints like a chiropractor, that leave ya paralyzed
From ya neck on down to ass-crack
So where we at? We in the middle of a war zone black
Politically word life you better open your eyes
And realize the game plan that the Caucasian man got mastered
And you only plan with one man left on the battlefield
So grab your steel and your shield and stand firm
With your God-U-Now to guard you right now
Cock back in all safety with one in the head, enough said

[Hook: P.R. Terrorist]
Allah sees everything
Allah sees everything

[Verse 3: 9th Prince]
Poetic extremely urgent material hit the streets that's made of criminals imperial
My eagle claw snatch out your testicle
I'm a killler without the serial spitting poisonous darts
Seize the charts, attack the heart, under siege like sharks in the dark
Visionous lyricist with a pen that's poisonous
Deadly venoms, the ink that'll drill 'em, stick 'em, pill 'em
Reveal 'em and kill 'em like the pilgrims
Challenging executioner, you must be stupider than Jupiter
I turn your ass into stone like Medusa
Nighttime addition when I vision
MCs are prisoners, the stage is the prison
9th Prince the warden, mind is made of platinum
I feel a million civilians, I flow like water skiing through the region
Lyrical avenger with a two-shot Dillinger
Prime Minister of ninja
Plot assassination with a Desert Eagle silencer

[Hook: P.R. Terrorist]
Allah sees everything
Allah sees everything
Allah sees everything
Everything
