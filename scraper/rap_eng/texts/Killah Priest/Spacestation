[Chorus: Robbie G]
I take you on a vacation on a spacestation
I take ye way way up
No looking down, I take your feet off the ground
We getting high, going higher than the clouds, c'mon
I take you a vacation on a spacestation
I take ye way way up
No drama for you now
No time to waste, my minds in space and I ain't coming down
Spacestation

[Verse 1: Robbie G]
Yo we spaced out, way out in the farthest reaches of the galaxy
There's abnormalities in what you're trying to say
Get our space away, I hope we find a way
I get blinded by your ultraviolet rays
Yo I'm losing my mind, trying to choose between this beautiful dime
The music and rhymes, the crew that's behind me
They say shoot for the stars
But how to stay apart from what's moving inside me
Ain't a physical pleasure you could deny me
The metaphysical, existential, extraterrestrial
Nothing less than exceptional
Levitating to another level, raisin the decibels
Devils settle your disputes the misuse of rebels
Love how music uses treble
And the levels of the bass
There's so many levels to this inner outer space
See I could win without a race
I could spend without the cake
I could sin without the hate
It all begins without a face
I need to get up out this place, c'mon

[Chorus: Robbie G]

[Verse 2: Robbie G]
Yeah we following a dream
I say why fabricate you should just call it what it be
Don't be following who's always in the lead
People waiting for you to fall back
Dominate the scene
Make our own constellations on the star maps
What's your knowledge? Where's your heart at?
What you calling a fallen angel, a martyr?
Pictures that's similar to all of the Holocaust survivors
While ye got a ball o' cash in ye wallet, all of them fivers
So many people fake balling I ain't calling out your names
It won't matter like matter when we're all in outer space
How's the place you keep your thoughts? you need to weed it a lot
If you can't handle the trip, leave if you need to get off
On earth in space I conversate and get people to talk
And let the DJ know it's time to get the needle to drop
Told you before if you hating you need to just stop
I'm on a spacestation out having a meeting with God

[Chorus: Robbie G]
[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Solar flares, polar air, breath deep techniques
White frost when the lights off, the mics a torch
DNAs, gamma rays, brain waves, new age radio active rapping
Plutonic gases, supersonic law of attraction
Radiation, aviation, hold the mic like planets
Verses I wrote contains ten billion volts
Open the vaults, quarantine
God like spawned the genes, seven ether
Richter is off the meter
When I go off the mic loses liters
Sumerian science or the giants
Alien alliance
Make me and the rhyme defiant
The red sun star, 40 million miles
Thatâ€™s how far I take the crowd
Competition I move them like clouds
In the four door car
I'm from the planet of the Gods

[Chorus: Robbie G]
