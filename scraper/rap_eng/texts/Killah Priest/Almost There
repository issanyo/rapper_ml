[Intro: Killah Priest]
First time in rap history your mind will be tooken to a level
Prepare yourself

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
When I relax my thoughts and my brain hovers New York
My third eye glides with the view like a hawk
They find my mind is automatic
Rhymes are tragic, found in the attic
Lost you in Asia, minor, find you in a laser beam
I'm supreme, my mind state is like a dream
Stargazer scarred from the radar
Beyond Gods and moms and airwaves and channels
Desert rats and camels, reptiles and mammals
Standings of Daniel, Emmanuel and Samuel
Ezekiel's wheel over tall trees and hills and mountains
Fountains, rivers, lakes, brooks and ponds
Inhabit by rabbits, snakes and swans
Energy is solar light barrelled beyond the Sun Controller
Over Jehovah through the days of Noah
Tremendous speed around the Octaman Sea
Black Sea, Sea of Caspainia
Persian Gulf all the way to Mediterranean
City of Atlantis, skin is getting tight as a mantis
Priest style is organic, mechanic seagulls, swings over the eagles
Soars over cathedrals built during the medieval
Shall remain in the ordained Byzantine Empire
Take you higher one stage as a massive fire
But still like Niger, arch rival of Constantine
Dark Ages got sparked through the stages
307 A.D. Constantinople ruled mobile
Seeking global floating motion over the Arctic Oceans
Scan the land, every inch of the sand
Never bring plans, animals, woman, child and man
Beasts and fish every inch, length and width
Come through the abyss over Egypt
A space odyssey with more angles than photography
More exotic plus it's erotic like pornography

[Break: Killah Priest]
Am I almost there?
Yeah I'm almost there?
Am I almost there?
Yeah I'm almost there?
Am I almost there?

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I'm a space cadet from a tape in the cassette player
By fasting and prayer, I'm passing the ozone layer
I meditate then I'm near top of skyscrapers
View fluid nature, dropping, blew through a vapour
Then there's paper, the wind that take you
Quiet as the breath in your nose
Appear in the cold from the depths of our soul
Which has no weight, constants rotate at a slow rate
Through the black holes over rainbows in Kuwait
Destination, operation, alternation of the Sun
Circuit stars, positions seasons, I weigh a tonne
Immortality through galaxies, I'm burning
It's like accomplished, plus the compass keeps turning
Pure as a virgin, release heavy burden
I travel when I preheated the urban
Hit the firmament, shock waves are permanent
Rays of children gaze and stand amazed
So long, I'm going to the place Paul Apostle was born
Which is in Tarsus, small city in Cilicia
Then I moved south, all the way to Nigeria
Row the Tigris River all the way to Assyria
Mesopotamia all the way to Syria
Euphrates to the Ur of Chaldees
Up the Highland located near Iran
Further crescent till I reach a section
From each direction, from East to West and
From North to South, all over the equator
Neptune from the womb of the creator
Killah Priest the Iron Sheik from the Middle East
I'm Almost There so prepare, I say peace... peace...
