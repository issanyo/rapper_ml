[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
His heart lifted like a glass of champagne
Fame Streff off his name from Brooklyn projects to hoods in Fort Wayne
Stand and applause by the hands on the clock
Above the audience watch pitch dark as he stood on his block
The night is agitated D's invaded with affidavits
Places faces and cases some were crack related
The young dude stood on his Q spoke to his crew
Words were smooth watch how he move
Glock on him to fly words that's in the ears of his peers
Words sincere tie not prepared 89 in fly gear
Before our eyes he took it there, said this is Sodom and Gomorrah                                                              years are numbered days are shorter
We need to switch up study the Torah
Kick the Shabbat change our name and call our brothers ak
I'm tired running ducking from cops
The crew wrestle with thoughts
No longer the transport and hit lil man off
Too many transplants in our camp we loss
I knew this judge his words was exceedingly strong
Unnaturally warm handout sentence like a storm
Rain on your boar from his horn
It was classic how he took the weed and passed it
Dumped the ashes and blew out the cosmic gasses

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
Bridges of dark matter giant clusters of rocks
Harmony of the universe a trillion years of buzzin lights
The only thing the cosmic world rose petals and snowflower water
Drawn up to shower fills up the macabre
To love is the true meaning of power

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]                                                                                Theres got to be more than just this
He sells his drugs and alcohol and they Rich
Took a fall become poor because of snitch
My will stands as pillars of Testaments
Repent to restrenph there goes that weed sent of peppermint
Stay focused the final hour approaches
Just try the coldest The Lord drinks from the cup of the sort saint
Magic fire Choctaw Indian we cover our face with warpaint hold up I think I need more ink
My arm the tattoo Lady drawn the sphinx
Silver needle that oolong tea that green and white in the winter mountain
Where they pick tender leaves we brew to smell aroma
God called but I hid like Jonah, I'm in my crib studying yoga                                   healing my ulcers ride the cosmic Wave like Noahstanding in the Celestial court caught thought till it's over

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
Bridges of dark matter giant clusters of rocks
Harmony of the universe a trillion years of buzzin lights
The only thing the cosmic world rose petals and snowflower water
Drawn up to shower fills up the macabre
To love is the true meaning of power
