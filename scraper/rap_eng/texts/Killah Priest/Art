[Hook x2: Killah Priest]
Art imitates life
So when I write my heart, that emulates life
All heights and all depths
Large nations and small sects
Standing ovation for old texts

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Who wrote the Bible or the Holy Qu'ran
While the pictures show 9 Templars holding arms
Crusade wars assumed their cause, produced their swords
The Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want
I called to the heavens, through Hell I walk
Humming the hymns within, salvation from a foul nation of sin
Genesis 10, how the races begin
After clouds brought this place to an end
Crowds of people occupy the spaces again
Eve children, weed building from the same tree that killed 'em
And Adam became a dragon, he said that he was from Saturn
He rubbed a lantern within his tavern
He came to build pyramids within the villages
Put up statues but it wasn't in their images
He say they built it from the top down
Mysterious circles found within the crops on the ground
His hand pointed slowly show his teeth was all black when he smiled
His garments smelled of myrrh but couldn’t hardly understand the word
Malnurtured but he bowed when he worshiped
And it seem that he shout a loud verses
And between 3rd steps he lift his hand and said, “Bless”
He take a bite of this plant and recycle a chant
His voice would get lower then he was sort of in a trance
Then he extend his hand and gave me the plant
As soon as I touched it, with this mind he instructed
I could be corrupted or abducted
I ate, I felt dusted, I started bugging
All of a sudden I saw the destruction and the reconstructions
I walked on fire and talked to Elijah
Saw empires implore their writers and reward their fighters
Kings that wore the hoards of tigers

[Hook x2: Killah Priest]
Art imitates life
So when I write my heart, that emulates life
All heights and all depths
Large nations and small sects
Standing ovation for old texts

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
A glass of water, a tank for all
Carry the blood in a pit of fire [?]
Under my pits of wire, strapped with bombs
The whole world is gone, see you in the sequel reborn
A wise man said we're dying in dread
Children won't last, chemical gas
Save the world, difficult task
Hollywood is much different from a Cali hood
Burn down the government? I probably would
Me and my Annunaki army is good
Even the mantis prays twice and once a day
He keep his arm folded just in case he forget
And even a snake praise His name when he hiss
Dance with the Devil so I had to split

[Hook x2: Killah Priest]
Art imitates life
So when I write my heart, that emulates life
All heights and all depths
Large nations to small sects
