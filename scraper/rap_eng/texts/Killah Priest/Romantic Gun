[Intro: Killah Priest]
Peace, my name is Leo Angel
I speak on behalf of the Black Market Military
Know what I mean? Revolution

[Hook: Killah Priest]
My Romantic Gun
Dance with me
My Romantic Gun
Dance with me
My Romantic Gun
Dance with me
My Romantic Gun

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
The way I romance my gun is like Cinderella at a ball
Slugs are the glass slippers when I squeeze the trigger they fall
I do the walks with my nine, two steps with my tec
Quick to come with the glove, leave a nigga wet
Play it like a clarinet, hold it like Louis Armstrong
Hell is home, when it starts to blow, you niggas know it's on
Black Market, know it from the projects

[Hook: Killah Priest]
My Romantic Gun
My Romantic Gun
My Romantic Gun
My Romantic Gun

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I dance with the devils, take a glance at the ghetto
Blam-blam with that metal, the beef is never settled
Like pulling up a medal bikes
Riding through the ghetto at night
Feel the fright, who wanna fight?
There's blood on the dance floor
Hold her arm she's .44, the other one's .22
May I have this dance with you?
She bust off shells, leaving cats falling straight to Hell
When I romance with her

[Hook: Killah Priest]
My Romantic Gun
My Romantic Gun
My Romantic Gun
My Romantic Gun

[Verse 3: M-Eighty]
They say that home is where the heart is
I’ve started out as an artist
Not trying be the hardest, I’m dying to be the smartest
My harness can hold a lot of heat
Honestly, I’ve been on the streets
Watching you while you’re watching me
Romantic Gun unraveling
Vocabulary visions our vices are often vicious
I start ‘em off then you finish
Each Sentence is cataclysmic like a Zodiac
Attack, slapped with Orion’s belt
Iron’s Held, Boom blast to the sky like Lions Yell
On the 11th Hour, 11th letter becomes a King
M-Eighty’s the modern David, Goliaths the industry
And these prophecies, Israelites light up the Seven Seas
Nemesis to enemies, lyrically I’m a genevese
