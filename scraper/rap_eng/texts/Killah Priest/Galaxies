(Intro) Priest
In search deep in the mind
You'll find it funk always living the heart
You know what I mean?
Brainstorming till the ink change form
Doing it

(Killah Priest)
From black space to face of the deep
Passing cosmic lights, till our Earth spin beneath the passage
Till the funky cosmic rhythm, that lies up in our solar system
Now I unfold this wisdom
"If you suck my soul, I'll lick your funky emotions"
Sound's coming from these deep Omens
Tap upon my pineal glands
My third eye swift as the bird fly
The eagles did land

(Chorus) Priest X2
In Galaxies we meet, Aliens and Sheikh's
Kings in the streets wrapped in gold sheets
For one common 'cause we came for the beat

(Interlude) Priest
You know, somebody had to plant it
That's where we in, somebody planned it
Since we lived on the planet Earth
So it was a plan at first

(Chorus) Priest X2

(Interlude) Priest
I could see further then my eyes could look

(Killah Priest)
A new government swerving in my mother-ship across the globe
Pop out wearing a Sorcerer's robe
Musical keys flying out my sleeves, funkyfied the masses
Got Aliens pop, locking with Aztecs
Green afros, resemble the Astros
Tripping of an acid, my eyes turn purple like I took the tablet
Looking Lazarus, moon-walking from his coffin
Octopus on the corner talking

(Chorus) Priest X2

(Interlude) Priest
Do you see? Do you see?
Travel so far to get to the past
And I turned back and looked into the future

(Chorus) Priest X2

(Interlude) Priest
In the beginning there was the pen and the pad
And the pad was without form, no writing

(Chorus) Priest

(Interlude) Priest
And the spirit of the hand moved across the path

(Chorus) Priest
