[Killah Priest]
Yeah me and the devil was cool
We both dropped out of high school
Started gettin' high and shootin' pool
He taught me all of his rules, which was none
[Lemme show you this gun]
Yeah we was wild about havin' our fun
We played cards and shot dice
Four, five, six, ha-ha-ha-ha
[Bet you can't roll that twice]
So we drove in this expensive car
He introduced me to broads, who loosen their bras'
And seduced me in bars
He showed me the loot; it was fun being a rap star
All the drugs he snort and shoot then pull out a black card
Everything charge, we neva max, we livin' large
The flyest suit, but it was all a facade
But somethin' in me was empty
Those mass of smiles was buried by me laughin' out loud
And our nights ended wit countless of women
It was temptin', a smooth dude I befriended
But then he said... and that made me go
Oh shit, then at the end of the night we broke out to a fight
Some he said got to my head
Something about him had me really on edge
And the ho's were laughin', I mean it was embarrassin'
And the devil got mad and told me to take a cab
I said you take a fuckin' cab
This is my car, my whip
All these of chicks, all these ho's that gave me away
This is mine and not yours
I looked 'em in his face
Then a hand touched my shoulder, and said:
"Sir you had too much to drink, come out the bathroom
Get out of the mirror"
Huh? What? Where's Sheila?
Ahhh, now I remember, I had beef wit this mothafucka
Where he at "Who sir?"
The mothafucka who brought me out here
Nigga was standin' right here
"Sir I don't know what you're talkin' about, but we about to close"
So I staggered to the couch and hit the door
It's cool, you mothafucka "Get home safe sir"
I feel bad, but I'mma get you
