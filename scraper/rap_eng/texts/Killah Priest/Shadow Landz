[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
My pen's the goggle lens, rap is ATVs
Hopping over sand dunes of mans' dooms
The grip'll tell where a killer dwells
Hides out in Cancun, fucking Spanish women
Tanning in sands his hands is trembling from rubbing lotion on her
On nude beach, two freaks, she's a goner
From street corners with heat on us
Come horseback riding with a tyrant who loves whores
But acts violent, he lures old women inside tents
Gets the knife in, slicing, it’s trifling
Lighting, spells out letters as he streak across the skies
P-R-I-E-S-elec-Tricty!
Come snowboard with the Ghost Lord
This what I wrote for, this what the horoscope saw
Soar from out a celestial academy
Look at the tree of life diagram see Priest's anatomy
From the medieval family called the Maccabeez
I grew up, left the Abbotcy, now they call me “Your Majesty”
Don’t be mad at me; I’m just a deity
I took on an alias
Cause we can’t pronounce the true name of the aliens
The African-Aborigine-Israelien, King Arthurian
Half-Nazarian, half-celestrian barbarian
The Sefer Yetzirah cards said Priest is a God
Go ahead read them all, you'll still see me as Lord!
Father's Enoch, my Mother's the Sephirot
Blessed, born naked near a barn in a dessert
Placed in the arms of a shepherd
I let the truth loose, before I take exit
Laugh to myself, how y’all calling me Walter? Body never dies
It just turns to the white suds on top of ocean water

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
The transformation of my lines, the transmigration of the mind
See what’s in mine, a seed full of rhymes
Magicking classics, tablets go way past time
The Moon is for season, the comets for signs
When I’m writing, I have actual sightings
Come bring the good tidings, my offerings is essential
Take a glimpse into my view of my mental
I’m washing in the lonely streams
The blood stain cloth, king on his horse
Only in my dreams he would talk
Telling me this is Hell, just leave
He was compelling showing me the music industry
My records not selling, my ruins and the end of me eventually
Said if I don’t go back, the road is black, the crows attack
I step back, spoke in a rap then formed into a Golden Axe
Blood and feathers, it seems like we fought forever
The skies turned terror, his eyes and flesh turned leper
Then I turn to this heffer, she told me "the skeletal figure
Rides a white horse slowly across the fields, this means end change
Accept that life is cyclical and that you're lyrical immortality"
Then I saw morgues around me, it got cloudy
She walked away, paused, she said "justice will be yours
A fair decision will be made in your favor", then I transformed into a gangster (Priest), can’t believe that I wrote this on paper

(Stranger, damn, stranger, damn)
