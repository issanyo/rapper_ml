[Intro: Killah Priest]
In the Beginning, no different from the ending
It's the Killah Priest, Iron Sheik from the middle east
Lacing it Sunz Of Man, you know what I'm saying
Big Moe up in the house
Ty G and Dreddy Kruger representing

[Chorus: Trebag, (Hell Razah)]
We make that music, that moves your body
(Natural high, natural high)
We make that music, that moves your body
(Natural high, natural high)
We got the fire, that gets you higher
(Natural high, natural high)
We got the fire, that gets you higher
(Natural high, natural high)

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Roaming in the 4Runner all summer
Laid back, state maps and 8-tracks
It's great that, I laugh at competition
I'm champion nigga, I can't be sunned
Check the royal posture, by the way where's my Oscar?
Crack your legs like a lobster, break your arms
Beat you to death, snap your neck crack your chest
Lay you to rest then confess
I judge wisely all spies, trying to size me
If you phony, I leave you lonely with your Sony
Headphones, laying stiff in the dead zone

[Verse 2: Hell Razah]
In the dead zone they lay
King Nostradamus with Golden Armless
Teaching hartlets that be stripping for they garments
Searching for a broken promise
Regardless though who your God is
Still feed you full for your conscience
Red Ant now launch this, rockets from Red Hook Projects
Come to street profit Alicia, to fish ya
Roll with a militia Mr. Military, now
Roll with a team of Jim Kelly's send my hoes to your telly
Spraying holes through your belly, you ain't ready
For the deadly, gently MCs
There ain't a school boy to test me
East coast to Wesley Snipe
Those who stress me, we strife
Fuck you with the fight, fight, fight, fight

[Chorus: Trebag, (Hell Razah)]
We make that music, that moves your body
(Natural high, natural high)
We make that music, that moves your body
(Natural high, natural high)
We got the fire, that gets you higher
(Natural high, natural high)
We got the fire, that gets you higher
(Natural high, natural high)

[Verse 3: Prodigal Sunn]
A young king at the age of 15 caught up in things
The golden Scorpio sporting material diamond rings
Physical, historical, mystical, shining crystal-like
Stacking packing pistols, FA and they brought the crystal meth
To Crown Heights where the fiends get high
Cross Atlantic Avenue, bone down through the Stuy
What we do or die unite the kingdom, multiply
I'm sick of seeing his mother's cry, it's time to purify

[Verse 4: Trebag]
Like an Alaskan breeze, I blow through your April's
Stuck to your mental like thumb-tacks and staples
Been to temples, learned Egyptian time-tables
My trade marks on labels and biblicals from mavels
Give life to trapped ex-cons and expedites
You can't escape my prison, I'ma living Israelite
Killing more [?] and build my paradise
Green grass grows, the white house is wiped out
Keep your red meat, I'll be fishing for trout
That means I'm the mouse, I'll figure my way out
Pinky and the Brain had to find another house
Whereabouts, go walk and frolic in the forest
Next time you lie, think about being honest, I bomb this

[Verse 5: Hell Razah]
We kill with calmness, words come forth like a savior
A wicked man's Heaven is the Hell for the Razah
Raised up in Brooklyn, two decades of meeting slaves
From prenatal to the grave, from the cradle to the cage
State pens be like play-pens, the government enslaving
Inside a science project with no escaping
Unless they die for it, you for the cream so you lie for it
While other thieves already spy for it
I watch snake eyes everywhere around me
Devils try to drown me in the water and the town built for slaughter
Without order you got chaos, player haters
Who play us, death-bed layers, who forgot to pay us
Now they covered up with layers
It's too deep for you rap duplicators who's packs be betrayers

[Chorus: Trebag, (Hell Razah)]
We make that music, that moves your body
(Natural high, natural high)
We make that music, that moves your body
(Natural high, natural high)
We got the fire, that gets you higher
(Natural high, natural high)
We got the fire, that gets you higher
(Natural high, natural high)
