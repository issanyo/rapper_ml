[Intro: Full Moon (Killah Priest]
Peace Killah Priest (peace, wassup man?)
Chilling baby (I'm with you)
Yo, I wanna know what's going on
Ever since that Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth
I wanna know what you gonna do for us right now
It's been a while baby, we waiting
I've just been chilling, been chilling
(I been in the lab writing and stuff y'know?
I just been on my, y'know, know what I'm saying on some)

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Guns, shootouts and crack sales
Black males who pack jails, trapped in Hell
No peace, cold streets, surrounded by police
This whole week, buildings with no heats
No lights and gas pipes with slow leaks
Dog fights and lowlife throw dice
The whole night thieves creeping in the midnight evenings
We saw through the misty regions
Go to your house, take a vial for the demons
Moonlit, the lunar eclipse
Prophets stand in the midst of the seven candlesticks
I can't take it, beauty that was once sacred
Is now getting facelifts, fake tits
And fake lips, cold embraces
Memory erases, from the slave ships
My princess, I used to spot her from a distance
Holding my infant, burning incense
The moment intent for her to step into my white tents
Now we step in precincts for your ebony prince
The smell of frankincense, once treated like a Pharaoh
With royal apparel, anointed with myrrh and aloe
We used to wallow amongst the mallows
We had herd sheep and cattle, now we battle
Used to pass over brooks of Kidron
Towers of Lebanon, the pool of Gershom
We used to sing songs upon Mount Hebron
How is gold turned to bronze and shhh
How is gold turned to bronze
We was the wisest and the richest, now we turned to snitches
Women turn to bitches, in the time of harvest
We was the smartest, worshipped Wisdom like the Goddess
Now we act retarded, forsook the Wisdom of the Fathers
We used to have a thousand flagons of wine
In Palestine, now we drink Ballentine
And raise up in the violent mind
We used to have a hundred measures of oil
Eighty measures of wheat and barley, we live Godly
Listening to Bob Marley, before the devils robbed me
Chasing us through the African safaris

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
From Then Till Now
What goes up must come down
What goes down comes back around again
Where it all began, began, began, began
From Then Till Now, From Then Till Now, From Then Till Now
(repeat 2X)

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Singing holy anthems, lamping with all my handsome grandsons
Hair long as Samson, inside my gold mansion
They used to wear purple Pampers
But now we Black Panthers, some are actors and dancers
It's funny how the dollar bill have my seeds holla for meals
Mother swallowing pill
Roads seem hollow but still, grab a bottle to heal
It's like a noose of seventh seal over Brownsville
What's the difference between the ghetto and death row?
I'm trapped up with kleptos, the Tec blows
I'm left to say a flow, where the cries echo
And echo and echo and echo and echoes
From the Crystal City, near Getti
Children used to grow on lilies, now they roll up Phillies
But the Pyramids of Cheops is my weed spot
Sometimes I eavesdrop in the books of Enoch
We went from studying epistles of Paul
Beneath a waterfall, rubbing crystal balls
But now we spray paint initials on the wall
On the wall, spray paint initials on the wall

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
From Then Till Now
What goes up must come down
What goes down comes back around again
Where it all began, began, began, began
From Then Till Now, From Then Till Now, From Then Till Now
(repeat 3X)
