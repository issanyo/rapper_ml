[Alan Watts]
An Alternative Myth:

If, there is any such thing at all as intelligence
And love, and beauty, well, you found it in other people

[Killah Priest]
Sitting in my chair, then the vision appears
Staring at the wall, the wall turned into the spheres
And the spheres held the planets
Some were distant, some near
Outer limits, I in a instant was there
Warm currents were rushing, infinities came in abundance
Centuries seasons Zodiac by the dozens
Prophesying thy coming, and it was told
I hold the mic way beyond the hundreds
The mic turned to greatness
Greatness took me to the sacred places to give
Threw glory over me like a blanket
Then I reclined so I can see the design
Voice said close your eyes, cuz all we need is your mind
And the rhyme like a storm as the currents blew me on
Through gasses, I saw places where planets were born
And the voice that spoke to my ghost majestic
Let's show you the essence
Let's reveal to you the presence
The Seventh Seal of the heavens
Within the will of the legend
The seal of the lessons
The skill is perfection
Knights kneel before the weapon
Alchemist of the sinister
To heal within the message
To build effervescent
I feel shadows all around me
They said they're just the pharaohs tryna crown me
There's tarots of crystal balls within your boundaries
You're now free to explore
All the visions encountings your mind can soar
For all the wisdom and counseling
A psychic mystique; I've been writing for weeks
Every time I say a rhyme it whitens my teeth
Make angels pillars of stone - people pillars of salt
What I reveal under the cloth, when Killah would talk
Swimming in the cosmic gulf, and the rivers of thought
Where the healers was taught
But in the mirrors seem lost
And they finished the planet Tiamat on the Shabbat
Then they planted Eden crops when the evening would drop
When there was nothingness
That's when Yah made the covenant
On the cross' blood would drip and the corpse buzzards pick
Time and admiration, stress and aggravation
I don't do yoga but I can stretch your imagination
God tears turns into prayer beads
Falls over the neck of Cardinal wearing the wooden Mary
Whisper verses over the buried, in the Celtic cemetery
And he held it till his visions were heavy
Like a time machine saw the dynasty of kings
Through the mind it was seen, the skyline turned to wings
We wear paint beads, water or oil
Saint holy men, beggar or royal
Angels, devils, or aliens, which do you believe in more?
Do you receive or restore?
Do you want peace or war?
Do you wish to live free or by law?
It gets deep to the core
We perform prayers faster than charities
Go on pilgrimage but do we know what real healing is?
Research a million in years, the real healing is here
Without the billion, I became a billionaire
From natural disaster, till the days of dinosaurs, the raptors
To common laws, to all kinds of war, till the rapture
