[Chorus: Ann Peebles sample]
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan

[Verse 1: Hell Razah]
We break your plans up, Sunz of Man, what?
Throw your hands up
Stand up soldierly, enemies close to me
The president shipping coke to me
The same one that threw a rope on me
Pick on dead brains like the vultures be
Build like construction, bring plans destruction
Malfunction your internet with intellect
There's doors in the Sunz of Mansion you ain't enter yet
Booby trap you like Solomon's Temple
Caught you tryna steal a jewel out my mental
Who sent you? Devils drive your soul like a rental
The hell what we been through
Ssince we stopped speaking Hebrew
We got robbed, stuck up with needles
Be careful they need you, they plan to delete you
My seeds soon'll lead you, it's good versus evil

[Chorus: Ann Peebles sample]
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan

[Verse 2: 60 Second Assassin]
Undollar, black power to destroy the real McCoy
We off the roof, oh yeah
One hundred proof, my plans
Sunz got it locked up, oh yeah
Chase begin with Vodka, oh yeah
Sunz of Man, could stop us, the plan
Set up perfect why flop us, my man
It be me and you, oh yeah
Down by the river, oh yeah
Without guns and triggers, Wu man
Sunz plan is perfect, don't dare
Think what I know when the nine ran
To the eight to the nine to the two G's
Never plan to fail, never fail to plan

[Chorus: Ann Peebles sample]
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Sleeping on Persians, we used to wear turbans
Daughters were virgins, gold slippers, now they go-go strippers who can't hold they liquor, they fight and bicker
Gossip throughout the projects, no logic
Jobless, digging out garbage, no welfare with no health care
The pain is felt here
They deceive Eve with TV's
Turned her into a species, won't feed the seed
The government raise the rent
Birth control pills, we owe mills
The black man and the black woman can't get along
Because Ricki Lake is on with two horns
Let's take it back to the applejacks hat
Before they shackled blacks
We was above things, we was supreme
Now we drug fiends
Shooting dope in our bloodstreams, we love cream
We love dreams, when their feet are soft
Coming up to me with three fourths, tryna get the freak off
But you know Priest thoughts, if knowledge is a free course
Keep your knees crossed
I can see fork tongue taught when I was young by the older
Brush it off our shoulders

[Chorus: Ann Peebles sample]
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan

[Verse 4: Hell Razah]
This plan ain't written we be living it
Wisdom flow ocean leak to deep to swim in it
Women, Lil' Kim and them instead of being militant
Be feminine, you guilty or innocent?

[Verse 5: 60 Second Assassin]
Rap black internationalist, niggas kill me with that old fashion shh
Claiming buy this, they ain't real with they topics
Claiming worldly knowledge, you get tossed like the Thomasses
It is a promise, kid, your English will get buff and
Based on like David then Rufffin
Your whole majors is frontin, tripling your front loot
So why y'all still thieving from the Sunz of Man independent group?
Information must be leaking out my faucet
True, out the blue and still ain't nothing new
In the Sunz whipping, even as it was written, as it was written

[Ann Peebles (sampled)]
You think you got it all setup

[Verse 6: Prodigal Sunn]
Interception of your production, self-destruction of the Sun Of Man
Never thought the alien, would eventually make grands
Hand in hand, peace to black man, woman, and child
Juveniles rock the poor, dedicated to Rikers Isle
The young peace and liberated, some deceased or separated
Non-educated, rated out-dated, they never made it
Swift wisdom precision, Islam my definition
The coalition make solid brolic wise decision
Snakes missing the fiction, out of jurisdiction
Too late to listen, I watch you burn my competition

[Chorus: Ann Peebles sample]
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan
You think you got it all set up
You think you got the perfect plan

[Outro: 60 Second Assassin]
I'm your father, I'm your daddy, I'm your brother
Asiatic, I'm your doctor, when you bleed
From heroin, teach your seeds
What they need, is true knowledge
From the tree, to be free
I'm your Sun of Man, I'm your Sun of Man
