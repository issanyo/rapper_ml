[Verse 1]
Jesus' angels
Pull another out in Beirut
Damn, hangman with daggers in his hand
She told me switch my plans, dreams of ladder like the Israelite man

The seven spirits of the virgin emerging
In my right hand
Fly crawls up her eye, she spoke
My head low, replied: "Why?"
She said: "Eat bread" jumps out the spiritual dumps
Holding a ultra-gun
I triumph, my life slump

So y'all niggas better beware this year, prepare
For the uprising, this is my assignment

[Verse 2]
Eagles and black wishes, Black Christmas
A Santa with the hammer, L's, loading clips and shells
Thunder *, bodies hanging from the antlers
Call the ambulance, cuz, transplant thugs
I emerge
From the verge

Bullshit
Sever the life cord, the axe of the reaper
Y'all hate nature, well, welcome to the urn of the cremator
Court's adjourned, attend to the king later
Stars alignin' when I'm rhyming
Welcome to Orion and to my second assignment

[Verse 3]
The murder angel wants you
Black dogs want food, black fog myst in front of the moon
Hawks grunt, * did you throw up your lunch
Light-headed, at the sight of your windpipe shredded
Your wife beheaded, your pets put in pots
Cooking pot, a Brooklyn plot
Is a cushion for ox
Been stabbed in the back more times

Write witches kisses

I'm working with, blood vacuum through the room
I write this doom priceless tomb above his head
I once said: "I'll be the best"
Put time to test, enemies to rest

You know fam, it's the tyrant
If y'all truly knew, y'all would stay silent
I turn violent, my last assignment
