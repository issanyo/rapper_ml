[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, manifest measures of life without the heat on
Phillies bare the central air, near the frozen green lawn
Eat by the handful, the handwriting sprawled
On 40 gold sinks, quicksand the colored thoughts
Bleed pre-meditation, we never get caught
He thinks to himself; would he bleed for the cause?
I'ma global warming heat soaring, street exploring rebel
Saw the face of the devil; it glowed like my blunt tip
Snake tongue, voodoo waterlogged imprint
Grand nationalist spin a web so thick
You can't escape, read the pro's prose see through the gate
Administer the sinister winds
To blend with similar slurs of vinegar darts create a curse
Elevated words measured on triple beams
Seasoned with regret, get skillful for our means
Self fulfilling profit from the bottom of scenes
Potent thoughts could kill if you discover what I think
Murder scenes covered in ink, all for the thought
Premeditated, levitated, sold and bought
'89 Pistons move in silence with no witness
Sling the grammar arm and hammer, Chambers Brothers bake shit
Gratiot to Gun Rule, get fitted for your hard hat
Spar with the shadow of self, perfect my portrait
Corporate drive-bys, tsunami rhyme high tide
Stand by, emergency mode damage the anti Wu related
My mind stay rejuvenated
Flagrant holes in patients singing like Betty Davis

[Killah Priest]
Uh, this Israelite... Yeah
Israelite literature makes me write vivid for listeners
Pictures of Saints in my ink, Stained Glass of a King's past
When my death began on Geffen
Till I rise to my old enterprise of Proverbs
Live words, colossals of my rhyme that block the mind
I jot in time, beauty of life, truly I write
To my seeds - may it lead you in war
Pleomorph, free Apost, squeeze that sword
Like Judas Maccabeus, Sir Maximus, the masses breath
I laugh while y'all dance with death
Establish the Tabbath
The Lord's commandment's for the Sabbath
Ya, Yarmulke's, honor of love, conquer us
My armor of thugs, armor of love
Yo, the pen blend minds with men in time
Priest, the prophecy, the odyssey
Biography of the God emcee
My artistry like no one could mark me
Michelangelo with the canvas, I make it glow
Like neon lights --- when I write

When I said I was the Da Vinci of the century
Uh, yeah, sculptures, when I wrote this

[C-Rayz Walz]
Chronic think tank
Dialogues my dimension & dare
Dark thoughts dwell in depths of despair
But on the other hemisphere is a section of flare
So solar soul controller's chauffer stars to stares
A supreme symphony where sunshine saturates
Symbols & shapes Rayz turn raisins to grapes
Planet of the blank tape renegade Rah Rah
Ventrilla-Native, Viking from Valhalla
V.I.P. vindicated, vanished in vapors
Transporter of the black plague disease data
Trainspotter, superhero weirdo zero knowledge 1 before ice
The Hall of Justice cut with a rust knife
A slice of reality this must be like...
A Think Piece....Yo resonate the beauty of sight
Now imaginate the essence of light
And Take a Stroll
The solar motorist composed it
Colder than the soul is
And the toll bridge he reaped so he sowed it
Quiet as a peep he thinks deep and she knows it
The code is spoken
And it keeps going when gold
Something like a bird choking on wind in the snow
Sword over head dread sight beyond damn sight
Grasshoppers watching ants grind near a campsite
Feeling Sunnyside and the price of gas mad high
Water Bill crazy & you can't get a land-line
Hibernate the heartache in criminal court
You could score if you get charged
Pay.....Subliminal thought
The Feds watching the head chopping Hob Goblin
That fell from grace in the face of the God and got pardoned
For my skaters & surfers who Billabong
Kill a song
So nice when he right...I feel I'm wrong
And still it's on
A Kings link Think Piece
