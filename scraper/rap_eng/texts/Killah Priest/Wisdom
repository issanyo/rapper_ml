[Intro]
Love of my life
You are the love of my life
You are the love in my life, my life
You are the love in my life, my life
You are the love in my life, my life

[Verse 1]
With God control, I take a photo of the globe
Like a space probe, let your tape roll to roll
My ways of life shine purple rays of light
Ways that are right take long days and night
Then I enter where there's no interfere
No sense of care, tense at the prayer
Then we exalt like cities of Lebanese
Drop with heaveness, must be Heaven-sent
Left with evidence, ever since you left
Seventh prince, and the pleasant scent of sweet smells
Exhale, I'm as deep as a well
Watch Priest prevail by fear and love
Let's soar through the air like a dove above the star circuits
Where Allah is perfect
It lies like an olive tree, woman follow me
Through the galaxies, just acknowledge me
We'll walk the calorie across the Sea of Galilee
I give you rubies for your beauty, you look as fine as jewelry
I chose the finest, your highness
I chose the finest, your highness

[Interlude]
You see my instructions are not silver
In knowledge forever then choice gold
For wisdom is better than rubies
And all the things that may be desired
Are not to be compared to it
Our wisdom will dwell with Punics

[Verse 2]
You're my one and only, during our holy matrimony
Attract my homies, subtract the phonies
What it manifold, make a man explode
Love episode, give me rest when I'm old
So clear and unbefouled, plus running wild
Caught you as a child, brought you under clouds
Never earthquakes when I'm home from work late
Never forget your birth date, I love you
Damn your understanding have me hunger like a famine
Prepare for landing, for landing, for landing
Aborting the River Jordan like a RZA recording
Fourth Disciple, bring forth the cycle
Or a tidal wave, it's like a B.I.B.L.E. page
