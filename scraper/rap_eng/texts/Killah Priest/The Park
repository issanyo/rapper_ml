[Intro: Killah Priest]
The park we do this
Yeah, the park we do this

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Candy apple, honey kisses
Play the pharaoh, one with riches on the throne
Harrow bones, stand alone, cow will moan
Finger pop the [?] with the rastas, y'all imposters
We the mobsters eating pasta
[?] so influenced by the music
