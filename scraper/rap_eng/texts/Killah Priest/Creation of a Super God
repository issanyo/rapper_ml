VERSE I
First the brain created itself
Inside of a mind
Around the island of thoughts
In a world before time
Then a fiction process starts
By telling itself it had a heart
The imagination began putting itself apart
This is called the animations period
By collecting proteins from the star Sirius
Let us create gods after our own images
From his own genes formed the king mysterious
Later transformed into a ruler
Then placed inside of a computer
Then later turn the mic into the future
That turned pens into bazookas
I'm from the world where gods are the prophets
Technology turned cheetahs into rockets
And lasers turned eagles into starships
The mind can build y'all never stop it
The rhyme's a wheel within the cockpit
Twelve hundred leagues under the sea
The god scientist formed this MC
My mic haunts the future city of dreams
Artificial gravity space viking around rings

VERSE II
Through the galaxies fallopian tube
I came out in a goo
Widen my view
Horizon atomic energy fuel
The first post-cyber rappers were used like super robots
With a fixed sequence of subplots
Hundreds of rappers would come from one blood drop
Blood clots wizardry on gold box
This science was called the stock character process
With organic arial objects
His first planet life feel
Was called the play test
Where he spit on the clay and made flesh
Infinite mind where the great light spun
In the orbit of the  eight white suns
The double phoenix ring
I came from Venus a king
Submerged in my mother's womb I was a submarine
Shooting rhymes like a pilot of a giant bio-machine
Attacking the central nervous system of religion
Read the verses on my pigment
Before I bust into the pigeons
And flap around the earth with a bat's envision
I rap intuitions
So listen to my mission
Then I turned my telescope into the heavens
The skeleton the ghosts the legends
The rhymes I wrote were weapons
As I rise out the molt a shepherd
Your demise 'cause you approach a leopard
The results it supersedes the expectation
Millions of volts breathe into a X-nation
Always inventing something new
I'm above the sun the stand point of this view
A billion worlds above the noon universes
Revelations
Space locations
Vanilla sky
After planets collide
Genocide
Alien hive
Lost tribes on horse rides
Holding a torch it's dark get scorched in the stride
Rappers falling short circuits
The thought merchant
Sea urchins MCs worship
Bottom feeders
Look at Solomon features
Y'all followed the leader
Now followed the creature
Tokyo witch
The flows I spit
UFO off a cliff
Cosmos ships
