[Intro: Killah Priest]
Yea niggas, its Priesthood back up in this motha'fucka bitch
Yea niggas, tear niggas down, +The Offering+ is comin' soon
Yo, the next beat yo

[Killah Priest]
I sit back watchin' The Discovery Channel on Hannibal
Wonderin' if it's sortin' Elephant intangible, Priest is animal
I can result to a Cannibal
Fly ya motha'fuckin head like its put into catapult
Or turned to a T-Rex, dependin' on what beats next
I rock fatigue ya niggas rock v-necks
I slap a rapper in Brooklyn so hard - the nigga get up out of the BX
Is that ya man? Well you'll be next
I literally push a nigga face in
'Til it come out in the other end
'Til he see his crew out the back of his head runnin'
"Like yo dawg don't fuck wit him"
And while you thinkin' of a rhyme
I sprinkly season on yo ass
I got pots cookin', this is not the lookin'
This nigga don't see it comin', I'ma make a pasta wit 'em
Two shots for Brooklyn, two shots for BIGGIE and Jay
Fuck that peace can make his own piggy bank
Ya'll wanna name names -- but see I fuck wit Nas and I fuck wit Jada
Fuck wit D-Block and fuck all you haters
I fuck wit Ra, fuck wit Canibus
I fuck wit real niggas who can spit
Who can do it like this?
You shake my hand I crush your fingers and pop your wrist
And if a nigga respond to me -- he gon' to bleed
Fuck a rap group, we gon' to need an Army
And I got nuclear rhymes, so you gotta get use to these lines

I'm like George Bush before the buttons pushed
Niggas loosin' they mind, I snap your back like broom for a spine
Priest is an epidemic, invented inside a clinic, define all rap and end it
Wit punch lines to give a nigga crenches
And When I spit the Statue of Liberty flinches
My sentences go inside a niggas heart and rip it apart
This is heart, this is Mozart, on acid you bastard
You a fuckin' faggot, open that nigga casket put 'em in
Ya haven't met the strangler, I got a torcher chamber
Wit ya names on and I name ya, I rearrange ya, cremate ya
I'll change ya, I complicate ya, you in constant danger
I use a nigga air for souvenirs
Your blood and guts all up in the mic booth smeared
Nigga use to screw face, now his face is on screws
Hangin' up in my crib, this is what I do to you
I use your head as a vase, Priest is a beast
A dark force, A dinosaur wit lock jaw
A killin' machine the breathin' guillotine
A demon hearin' your scream, you?re bleedin'
I'm still in ya dreams I'm not leavin'
I'm like the curse of Emily Rose when I entered your soul
And I kill you from the inside out
First let me burst your heart, then cry out
And your scream sounds like music to my ears from a beat machine
It's sweet to me; I listen to it like its classical music
I bring through it, I beat your ass wit a motha'fuckin' pool stick
Poke ya eye balls out wit a tooth pick, want me to prove it?
I'll do it; I'll spit 'til my mouth is all white
Like it's covered wit cool whip, BITCH!, +The Offering+ nigga, Priest!
I'm comin', I'm comin'
