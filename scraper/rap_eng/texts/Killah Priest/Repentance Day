[Intro: Killah Priest]
Yo, it's that time

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
As the door close, the cold wind blows
Down America like the Wall of Jericho
Some are wolf in sheepâ€™s clothes
Many are called but few are chose
Who knows until the day they be exposed
UFOs surround the globe, the world is prepared to explode
So I grab hold of the North Pole
Not tryna meet the lost soul at the crossroad
We're being sucked up into the black hole
Young becomes old, mighty clouds roll
Unfold the scrolls that were foretold
By the forefathers, the end of the world saga
Streets flooded with lava, mamas and papas
Toddlers, hip-hoppers and Rastas
Rock stars and mobsters, above streets in helicopter
Filled with doctors, reading the death roster
Guts spilling out like pasta
Sky, misty, often tipsy from off the whiskey
The gypsy  told me  my chances were risky
Cops, pull up and frisk me but never could they get me, too shifty
I will go, into my dungeon, and summon up the second coming
People started running
Aliens with hair like rastafarians
Captured, placed inside of aquariums, studied by scientists
This is it, the Apocalypse, I see the mother ship
Above the cliff, over Egypt, it made me sea sick
I see the eclipse, and the abyss, the night shifts

Chorus: Hell Razah (repeat 2X)
It's Repentance Day! Repent for your sins
When the gates of Heaven open up and Hell's closing in!

[Verse 2: Poetic]
An archangel imprison my soul into a prism
Using cell division and molecular collision he then made Me
Listen and analyze the heartbeat and rhythms
Of children living brutalized
My ears became used to the vibes of ruined lives
Sounds in the chamber I was hidden in
Was so spine-tingling I was trembling
Envisioning the fear, here within a new Millennium
Where rain became toxic, the air's stale and noxious
Comets hit co-ops with force that made blocks split
Flocks tried to escape a fate that made even hard rocks slide
As nuclear dropped out of the sky
Causing burns too severe for hydro peroxide and sodium oxide
Deep outta basements
Fish turned lopside and upside down from atomic facelifts
Through the blackness I saw John the Baptist on the atlas
Holdin the masters to my Psalm under his arm
But long before I even wrote 'em
23 elders each wrote me a Psalm
And placed them within my motor neurons
It contained the approximate date of The Apocalypse
Deposited in scripts of the 20th century prophets
The clock ticks, tick, tick, tick upon the land borders
I count down the manslaughter
Military camcorders under ocean waters
Red October causing fish to grow arms, legs, tits and double heads
Mutating the eggs as the radiation spreads over the water beds
I watch Mother Nature as she bled
Grym was placed in skin casing
To begin lacing hymns through the basement
Won't be no escaping from the South to the North
Where you run ten paces and your face is falling off

Chorus

[Verse 3: Hell Razah]
Raised in Hell, waiting for angels like Raphael
Coming from space to trace, they race
Thrown in jail cells I had a purpose since the sperm cell
To bail out and get Braille for the blinded children in Israel
Kids kill forget the bill for dollar bills and drug deals by the mayor
Controls the people living legal
Sit back and chill until time will reveal
Two thousand and one holy men with forcefields
Levitating space ships, earthquake hits, United States splits
Projects turn to snake pits
Secrets of the Masons came to Revelations
Babylon destroyed by the nations aggravations
Riots in the train stations, criminals grabbing cops
Snakes rattling, angels dragging
Seven head dragons out the Roman empire surrounded with fire
Liars in the Pentagon drop their nuclear bombs, ran, panic
But still was trapped on the planet
Died before the mothership landed
Only the chosen ones understand it
Some can't cause of TV brain damage, no time to be romantic
This day your independence and repentance, 'pentance, 'pentance

[Break: sample]
"Now I see clearly, my whole life is moving in one direction
I see that now, there never has been any choice for me."

Chorus
