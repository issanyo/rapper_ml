[Killah Priest]
My millennium years is in the hundreds
The abundance of the Earth's circumference
More verses under the summits, reverse the compass
Bursting of thunders, let it rain from the brain there's a storm
Each unit is drawn like a cuneiform, grow wings like the unicorn
I sit down writing rhymes from noon to dawn till the moon is gone
As I remain in solitude, I do the impossible
I can move a molecule like a marble move
The hollow the cube dissolving into two
The rhyme revolved and turned them back into fuel
Thought of mind and it turn into food
I drop a jewel that's too heavy
Bars is over his head, he's getting sweaty
Can't pick up the line he ain't ready
Steady doing push up with you pushing your luck
Pressed for time then I wait, this gem is for the class of the great
The star elder, the cosmic heart astrology chart
Mars dweller, body becomes cellular
Encoded with DNA of poets, sky gapes
Guided to the cosmic on a landscape, my phantom escape
Saw myself standing in a round structure, dome shape
I heard the gods Ausar, Abzu, and Heru
Somewhere near a pyramid in Peru

The Adonai, Most High, I and I
[?Al-Lo'chaim?], Elohim, King of Kings
The Nommos from the cosmos, serpents for the logo
The first Sapiens were the hobos
Quetzalcoatl from the star Sirius B
Gods from the period B.C
Perfect like the pendulum through energy continuums
Half brain reptilian called the Anunnakis'
Landed in the safari of Mali saw the Dogon tribes
They had scaly skin, proton eyes, floated on in the skies
Nibiru, Vishnu, Neteru, the disc move from the sphere cube
The Earth was void and formless, empty without voyage
Weight and density they formed their assembly
Darkness was upon the face of the deep
With their conscience they found the space to create heat
So they moved upon the face of the waters to create in these quarters
Moving through space in these saucers to show and prove
It got so hot it evaporated then made it cool with their aura
Then one spoke, "Let there be light!"
Then they took the ray and called it day and the shade they called night
Within their specs they formed the gas clouds
Of energy, mass perfect and round
With widths, depths, and pounds a system of planets, inorganic and organic
Amino acids, chemical catalysts,  catalysts becomes enzymes in time became cells
That fell until oceans, became whales (wells?)
Creature with fins, then skin and shells
So they started high above us, the sky structures
Then they made pigment and eye colours
Their glory transmitted to man image through chromosomes
Divide the combined clusters divine wonders
Multiplied in wide numbers, knowledge, singular
That's one from plenty gods
In their glory they spun us the Sun, a duality
Two wisdom when in their glory again created a system
New reality, a school of alchemy
They formed the trio, understanding
Meaning under the heavens is standing above your ego
And culture was the tetra-geometric of four
Freedom gave them the power to add one more
5 that's a pentagon
This gave man the idea to draw the shape of stars
Equality, the subtublet the blueprint of God
The 7 sides of the heptagon
They wrote their names in the book of life, the angelic lexicon
Complex they begin to build a octogon
That's eight and every nine thousand years is born in space
And reformed and reshaped
God's spirit inside a hydrogen case
That let us create, body then face at perfect temperatures
At 37 Celsius
And give them trees for vegetables and cereals for healthiness
Have you not heard, have you not seen dimethyltriptamine to the mausoleum
Back to the gods, back to the star beams

Origin, their cells fell and the ocean became whales (wells?)
Organisms and the time before, then the dinosaur
