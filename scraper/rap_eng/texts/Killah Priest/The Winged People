[Intro: Killah Priest]
Do you really know? Or were you taught what you know?
Do you believe or do you know?
Is your faith blind?
Or is it bright as the Sun?

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
They were here before Adam, descendants of Anu
Took on mortal fashion, built themselves statues
In the image of themselves to worship themselves
Built towers to themselves to remind them of when they fell
They came from a station in space, an angelical race
Giant in stature, helmets and capes
That they wore, visiting this planet to explore
Long journey from their own because their race had war
It's said they called their planet Nibiru and that they were fallen heroes
They saw gold, saw trees and life more liberal
Astronauts with afros and locks
Jet beaming into a ziggurat, they crashed on rocks
1.21 gigawatt, some passed over crops
In the tablets of legend, they said they opened the floodgates of heaven
Describing ten monstrous brethren
Chopping up their grandparents into seven pieces
Now they're looking for a region, they traveled eastern
Found a garden called Eden, they saw a being
Forced to bow before Ba'al or be exiled with the tribe of reptiles
Now called the Rothschilds and X-Files
Life begins breathing hydrogen inside of high winds
Milky Way violins heard by the wise men, observed in Orion
The windows with no end, the black glass in the sea that extends
Within that sea exists carbohydrates, these gods were hybrids
That went back and forth 'till they mixed with star bread
In the foods of thought with proteins
Protons and Adams produced the whole gene
To infinity to density to matter to atom to cells to organisms
To metamorphism to waters of the living to bodies back to godly
