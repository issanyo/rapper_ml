[Killah Priest]
I burped upon my mothers skirt, threw up it church
Lift my little head, looked around the room, that alert
At first I seen two ladies who reminded me of a nurse
The first creatures I seen while coming to this Earth
In search, my mind still seeking
I seen this little lady life her little arms, shouting glory while she reading
Curiosity, I start reaching for her book
My mommy took my little head, laid me on her shoulders and shook
Almost went to sleep but no not this time
A lot on this young toddlers mind
Dreams of kings, and graveyards and thrones and dollar signs
No one interpret but I guess this day was my purpose
I lift my head again and start searching

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
My ancestors brought from Africa on the slave ships
Now return in the air with first class trips
Passenger six, window seat, relax and viewing the fish
The trees, the seas are blue like the jewels on my fist
From the islands of Costa Rica we share the same life
Children play with marbles of gold, return the plight
We share the same life, we share that same life

[Killah Priest]
I heard his voice in the side of my ears, mad raspy but clear
So I start to turn around real slow, y`all know
I`m shaking and stuff, that baby thing about to fall
You might laugh but I`m two inches tall
Finally, I see this black man in a black robe
His hair all white, turning pages, saying lets read Job
And above him this white image on a cross
Then suddenly, a light enters my thoughts
Indian Gods look like them, Chinese Buddha looks like them
Arab`s Muhammad look like them
I thinking why I`m in an all black church
But then Jesus have to have white skin
Like him, it`s kind of frightening
That`s why everybody else prosper `cause they won`t convert to me
Your own are supposed to always come first
Not only that but Moses was Pharaoh`s favourite
Made ruler over everything, lay with Egyptian maidens
And Pharaoh loved Moses like his own
Same lips, same nose, same skin tone
Even Hebrews hated Moses, they thought he was Egyptian
Put Ramzi and him together they couldn`t tell the difference
And learn this fact, history proved that
Ancient Egyptians were always and still is black
That makes Moses, Joseph, Jesus and David
The same colour as the tribe chained on the slave ships
Not only that but Moors ruled in Spain
For a thousand years they reigned, we complete that chain
We have black scholars like J. Rogers
While the devil government praise their dollar
I pray for the day they holler

[Chorus]
