[Intro: Killah Priest]
Yeah, it's Killah Priest right here, The RZA
You gotta go in on 'em, youknowhatimean
It's been a long time, a long time coming, play games with him, yo
It's going on, I'mma go, ight

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
I spit dope, a triple mean, mixed with Listerine, in my sixteen
Kill rappers pon contact, rap combat
I drop lyrical bombs at, my palms crack
Microphone tribal stone, long gats, bullets get thrown
Tear up your flesh, break your bones apart, complicate your heart
Flatten your arteries, put your brain in a park
It's hard to breathe, arguably, my niggas glide on the arc
Lyrically, rearrange your face, banana clip for my apes

[Interlude: Killah Priest]
Nahimean, you know what this is, it's Priest and the RZA
Ugh, yeah, yeah, we been doing this for a long time
Yo, Wu-Tang, Sunz of Man, we gonna go all the way in

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Black heavens, a palace with bulging walls, that push the paintings awkward
Above the broken floors, Roman war
Iron fingers, look, I just broke his jaw
Bodies lay like dolls, coming from the great fog like Greyskull
From a graveyard, through cave walls
Check out the cover, it's that Malachi Z. York? Nope, that's just warped
With a psychic mind and deep thought
From a palace or a shrine with street talk, ready to blow heat off
From other worlds, balance on a see saw
No one's rougher, hang with Goliath brothers, snatch a table cloth
From the last supper, wrapped around my dome
Just grab the microphone, and spit the bible through poems, I'm in my zone

[Interlude: Killah Priest]
Youknowhatimean, you know what's going on
Priest and the RZA, RZA and the Priest
Youknowhatimean, Psychic World, let's go

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
I'm like King David, wings waving, psalms in my mouth
Armed in my trials, with gauges
Holy orbs been doused, I'm royal from the 8th house, great bout
Seven churches, seven virgins, seven spirits, seven lurking
Seven stare, seven lamps, seven prayers, seven seals
Seven ant, seven horns, seven angels, seven trumpets, I crack you like the dawn
I break day over your head, pray for the dead, golden veil, chosen hell
