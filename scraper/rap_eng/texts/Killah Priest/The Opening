Initiating startup sequence
We're going to turn it on
We're gonna bring you the power

[Intro: Killah Priest]
Peace yo, yo my name is Priesthood
I’m from a planet of a thousand suns
A million years and I came down to your galaxy to MC
Know what I mean?
I’m from a time called forever, that’s eternity, know what I mean?
We get into this right here, uh, get into this, yo

[Verse: Killah Priest]
Amazing platonic solids, rhyme tonic with knowledge
Robotic machinery hand blasting mic rockets
Take off then dock it, futuristic lizard with lyrics
Jewish mystic descendants, Hindu with vision
Temples, Hasidics with Christians that listen
My mission of them, who came to Earth first from a star burst?
God-shirt warm with pockets of conscious logic
Cosmic garments, doctrines, Lord Marduk from stardust
That God touched, planet’s space product
Fell from grace to hard luck
My wings became arms, feathers became fingers
On that day it stormed, my face grew meaner
Till it screwed to a cruel demeanor
Chasing money pursue till the beast bring his crew with FEMA
There will be war between us forever

[Outro: sample]
During the battle Harlock realised the Zetons were trying to lure him away from the Earth, leaving it unprotected
So he turned away from the enemy spaceships
And chartered a new course back to his native planet
