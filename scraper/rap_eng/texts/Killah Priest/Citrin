[Verse 1]
Gentlemen you’re about to witness lyrics by a chemist
Witness biophysics written like hieroglyphics
Predictions like Bible scriptures traditions and tribalism
So step right up see it all if  you’re quick enough
To get in line for the most prolific rhyme

[Dialogue]
Any clear idea what you’re trying to trace?
An asteroid, an orbed mineral safe in a shell, a shell of stone
With power, in this shell something travelled to the Earth
Alive – as far as we know it

Is there a fifth planet, there’s no doubt about this it’s giving us CS sequence
It’s the Asteroid
What’s the distance?
Something over 500,000 miles

[Verse 2]
Where these stones were once computers is tomb raided by looters
Excavation rumors said these rulers died from a tumor
From the Land of Sumer, sat around blowing hookah
The unknown off the coast close to Montezuma
The ancient man from the future
Raised on thoughts of Buddha
In the page I lost my humor
Now rage is my consumer now the rhymes are incredible
Format impeccable concepts intellectual
My page is bi-sexual my pen grabs its testicles
Cause the mind is very flexible
I fuck with the track because the rap could be edible
Digestible medical terrible incurable
Identical to hetero terrestrial [tentacles] for his genitals
Rap professional I can reach celestial pinnacles
Or catch a mineral place it in the subliminal memorable
Remove the nitrates watch his mind break
As his soul vibrate at a high rate
His spirit gyrate at a speed he can’t titrate
Brains broken, it’ll never work again
Malfunction

[Chorus]
Now I got the Citrin, polish it with the friction
Word of diction make you scared like superstition
I got the Citrin, polish it with the friction
Word of diction make you scared like superstition

[Verse 3]
432 Hertz I put in this verse A elder from Earth
Welded the universe into the heavens and hammered the bracelet
Around the god’s basement then going into myself
Then coming out multiplying the creation
By adding and separating playing with the magnets
Of the planets the size of thought is gigantic
Engineering the data on my writing base
That’s where all the gods would gather - life in space
Increasing the lights in the matter for size and shape
Throwing the matter into the stratosphere
Am I clear can you hear picking up some static fanatic
New exhaust memory loss wintery frost on your mothers board
Impale a rapper then grab another sword
All gauges locked to prepare for shuttle war
Shoot nukes from out my booth
Send rocket dogs envied the size of parachute
The comet at night, the Cosmic Christ
A cross, made of quartz, you’re in a gothic night
He bleed til his arteries shut off
I put his conscious on ice tombs with air compressors
For the ancestors – to wait. Roll back the stones
I’m coming from space I told him he’ll never repair again
Take him through currents and RPMs take off his head then his limbs
Rip him apart then put him back together, Press start
Destroy his ego with the torpedo sharks
Took the Citrin from the planet Saturn
Placed it in the Garden of Eden for Eve and Adam
It’s for liberation and Karma, check my armor in rapping
I took Armageddon and placed it in my pages for ages
As disaster

[Chorus]
Yo I got the Citrin, polish it with the friction
Word of diction make you scared like superstition
I got the Citrin, polish it with the friction
Word of diction make you scared like superstition
