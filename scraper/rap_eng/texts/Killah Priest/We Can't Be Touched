[Hell Razah]
9-7, grab your righteous thougts
And get rid of em, its the 5 Deadly Venomz
Grab your righteous thoughts and get rid of em
Its the 5 Deadly Venomz
Grab your righteous thoughts and get rid of em
Its the 5 Deadly Venomz, yo

[Chorus x4: Hell Razah]
Ain’t nothing new about the Sunz of Man
We can't be Tony Touched
You either build or destruct us

[Killah Priest]
Near em Tony Touch, I grab MC's within my clutch
And crush, I wipe my hand off, while opponents stand off
And look sad and worthy, bloodthirsty
No mercy, I kill 'em while they curse me
And damn po-9 to search me, don't get me started
I flip retarded and start choking artists
And leave they kids broken hearted
And fatherless, I'm too marvaless
Why would you bother this
I squeeze you neck til the saliva drip
So tight, I bite off my bottom lip
Until your head pop and your soul leave
Whoever told you I was holy, I'm Killah Priest

[Makeba Mooncycle]
Eliminate my competition like a Shogun
So bad, I have you switching colors like Michael Jackson
Represent from Crown Heights to Bed-Stuy
You either do, you either die, while your trying to survive
All these street lyrics are like Psalm
So, Brooklyn maniacs remain calm
So, come get some from Park Place to Putnam
We hold shit down like Franklin Av
You get shot, gaged and stabbed, buying guns from the Arabs
Ah, Makeba a true bitch beater
Gotcha hot like a heater when it's pumping out your speakers
Flipping American like Nacirema
From Gracia Garriga, behind a Sun of Man you see Mooncycle

[Prodigal Sunn]
4th Disciple, what, blazing like a rifle

[Hell Razah]
I see too many wannabes be living comfortably
Southern, comfort me, whats the reason why you front to be
Something like it only took you months to be
Personally, I take your mentality to Mercury
Bring you back to Earth to see, the same ol
Check the Sunz of Man lingo, we got for minutes, defendants
Wack students get suspended, shoot you down with a sentence
As you back for repentance, Sunz of Man can't be Tony Touched
Dreddy roll the dutch, crunch berries in my cup
Bitches stress to test my lust, quick, you busting guns on us
We move crowds like clouds, lightning struck whoever sucks
Some claim to be Allahs, but they force gods
Selling out for cars, telling lies to the stars
Why you front at clubs and bars, I be in tune with Mobs
Royal Fam, United Kingdom, now expand
Go to war like the Pakistan
Been fighting devils since the sonograms
Now it's, programs on my avenues, satin out to master you
Live daily masker you

[Prodigal Sunn]
Yo, in these dark days of Vietnam
Death is a pawn, that's word is bond
Sound the alarm, we surround calm
Bury arms, spark a mega-charm
Rocking charms, true and living Islam
My supreme wisdom becomes a realistic sitcom
On the grounds of Brooklyn, sent you walking through the Crooklyn
So, until then I make ends meet, war with the beast
In the streets of heat, moving is weak, formation concrete
Medina soldier, mathematical, alphabetical
Quoted an intelligent sire, contain the element of fire
Mental igniter, who said the student 'bout the lighter
As it was written, bitten in the Book of Obadiah
Shower soldiers, sold for papaya
Original soul writer, the golden fighter
Swift, clever like the tiger
So, on the contrary, you can get bloody like Mary
Head flown, like a tooth fairy, crushed like some berries

[Chorus x3: Hell Razah]
Ain’t nothing new about the Sunz of Man
We can't be Tony Touched
You either build or destruct us

[Hell Razah]
Black Rose Family, Gray Rose, Touny Touch, what
Tru Masta, yea, what, 4th Disciple, Killah Priest
Prodigal Sunn, Hell Razah, 60 Sec., what
7th Ambassador, what

[Chorus: Hell Razah]
Ain’t nothing new about the Sunz of Man
We can't be Tony Touched
You either build or destruct us
