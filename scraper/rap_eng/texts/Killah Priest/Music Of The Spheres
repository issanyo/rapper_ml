[Audio Sample 1]
To the pythagorians, that discovery had a mystic force, they felt that all the regularities in nature are musical
The movements of the heavens were for them, the 'Music of the Spheres'...

[Killah Priest Chanting]

[Audio Sample 2]
As they had bare the Ark were coming to Jordan, and the feet of the priests who buried the Ark were dipped into the brim of the water, so the Jordan overflowed all it's banks at the time of the harvest, that the water that came down from above, rose up...

[Killah Priest]
My brain's the throne of glory
My voice is seven million stories
My slippers walk through space, Gods territory
The Devils mad, he cast hell before me
But I prevail, broke the spell, fortune teller foresees
Black years for you rappers
The aftermath is here
While I recline listen to the Music of the Spheres
I spit above your ears
It's that Angel music
That sky crack, that wormhole, that star acoustics
Let God acque it
Play it, In the Mosque(Mask?) out my mouth is a fusion
No illusion
My cosmic conscious
Coming like a hail of comets
Godly contents
I sit between two universes
Judging every rapper upon the surface
And laugh at them like a circus
Ya'll mad nervous
I wrap a cloud around my dome like a turban
You can't live to see me in person
You just a servant, so now bow and worship
It's the wordsmith... x2

[Hook][Scratches & Cuts]

[Killah Priest]
My mic's the microchip
My rhymes are the hieroglyph
From the edge of a spiral cliff
Hurling my rap books to the wind
Like a staff through a tree I cringe(?)
Then get up with a sick grin
The sacrifice
Thoughts are magnetic
I bring down satellites
Forget ya'll earthlings
I spit for the afterlife
Astral projection
My face see inside of paradise
Either ya'll half man pussies
Or ya'll straight hermaphrodites
Parallel worlds
Your bodies I twirl
Then throw ya'll far into the galaxy
Who want to challenge me?
You out of reality
I come down your flight of prayers
As if they were escalator stairs
The death relate is here
Your respirators prepared
I bake myself a cake using the ozone layer
Happy birthday
Blow out the stars in heaven
Get high taking mushroom clouds
Spit bars of Armageddon
The super God of weirdness
Sincere-ness
Share bliss
I spit that heaven & hell, life & death
That here & now, to outer realms
Genesis to twenty twelve
In heaven, what separates good from evil
Is a giant iron curtain
Guarded by a lion with manes of serpents
Priest, the wordsmith

[Hook][Cuts & Scratches]

[Killah Priest]
King of kings
Lord of lords
I hold up a gold cup, filled with ???? of rap(?)
Making an acoustic ball
Revealing all
