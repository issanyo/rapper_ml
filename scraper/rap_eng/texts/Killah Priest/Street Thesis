[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
The artistry night settles down over Montego Bay
The hustlers and ballplayers come in to play
Lifestyles give a grand view as Pan Am flew
Some nest down from the iron wings of Jet Blue
Dress shoes beach front penthouse, pimped out villas
For fly niggas, quiet killers
Millennium condominiums with wide pillars
The finest community’s resorts for golf, digital room keys
Luxury spas for broads, shopping, dining
The beach chair with the mayor reclining
A clear atmosphere, see the planets aligning, shining
Dive in the turquoise water, during sun-time
During the moon skyline the stars reflect like quarters
Then it’s casinos, poker the gamblers come out
But on the other side its soldiers, the hammers dump out
They shoot up corners, five Gs stashed for the lawyers
In case someone saw ya’ amongst the snake-talkers
The night walkers the native New Yorkers
All the way across the borders, we hit the streets like savages
Start apartheid like the Africans
M-16 with banana clips
The streets made us like this, I told my psycho-analyst
Can’t handle it

[Hook x2: Killah Priest]
Better than a young man’s knowledge is an old man’s experience
Skin tatted up, my mind is luxurious
Though I stumble I rise, seven times stronger
More thorough in the mind, street thesis

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
We all in prison, none of us free
Shop in the richest neighborhood, it’s still government cheese
Shove ‘em and squeeze, gut ‘em and leave, blood on their sleeve
Cut ‘em with these, roll ‘em in a rug under trees
Mob dude laughing, cartel assassins
Fucking guy, I use a barbell to bash ‘em
Democrats and the fascists, nukes pointed at the continent
Armed defense board of education decaying
Bombs commence attacks in Iraq, sign of the times
Money over mind soldiers in the line, Jehovah or the wine?
The news takes over the tube, face confused
This place is a zoo, meanwhile at Mr. Chow’s
Sitting down with black cards and fast cars are rap stars
That attracts y’all, if we don’t tell the truth to the youth
About their roots what they planned for you
We deserve the punishment due

[Hook x2: Killah Priest]
Better than a young man’s knowledge is an old man’s experience
Skin tatted up, my mind is luxurious
Though I stumble I rise, seven times stronger
More thorough in the mind, street thesis

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
How I stay afloat as the GOAT, the rap game needed a pulse
Y’all beat it to pulps, what I seen was a bulb
Above my skull, I took the oath
Expose y’alls team as a hoax, what I seen was a joke
I went in the vaults
The murder I wrote never heard my approach
Silence will I kill the giant? I’m still a lion
With the courage to give y’all the street coverage
Heat busting, flights with the Louis V. luggage
‘Till police cuff ‘em coming through customs
Slug ‘em or they drug ‘em
Bullets through his chest or his stomach
Death is sudden coming from the east, north, west and southern
Streets is stubborn you cheated, you fronted
The priest is governed by higher forces, maybe flying sources
From another orbit or they hide in waters
Found by scientists when I’m rhyming I am Hiram Abiff
My lines are the bricks

[Hook x2: Killah Priest]
Better than a young man’s knowledge is an old man’s experience
Skin tatted up, my mind is luxurious
Though I stumble I rise, seven times stronger
More thorough in the mind, street thesis
