[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Ancient worlds with airplanes, scientists canâ€™t explain
Shadow pharaohs travel aboard portal trains
Through wormholes abode, without burning coal
At dusk priceless busts like Tut and sit on gold
Before the lord raindrops hit the globe to wash away the giants of old
Before Adam lying in the garden with his ribs exposed
Reconstruction of the cosmos, the worlds that God rose

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
The imagination has a bridge to fascination to which we live
In Genesis take a pilgrimage to the wilderness
Stop searching for the wiz
What you need? Courage, heart or a brain?
Rediscover each part, I'll explain
The tin man is the working man, he had no heart for retire plans
The scarecrow was the Farmers
Y'all know they say southern people had no brains
Without them we get no vegetables or grains
Zion was the lion, had no courage
Dorothy and the dog now is now uncovered

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
The origins of the kabbalah
The Moors bend before Allah
The articles of the merkabah
God moves in the aggadah
Black Jews salute, Yahawah
Yahweh, Yahuwah
My medulla go through futures
A pearl in the sky
A cloud in the shape of a shell in the land where Oysters die
I stood on the beach, I started to cry
Sand shot from eyes, I dive in the ocean to dry

[Verse 4: Killah Priest]
Memoirs of of tomorrow, a ship lodged in a bottle
Societies beneath a sun inside a Earth that's hollow
Fuel burst from Apollo, a crew search for a marble
That can give each human the feeling like it hit the lotto
The sky fell by the head of a swallow
A thousand eagles lifted it off it's body
And back to the cosmos, book scrolls and novels
Subatomic clouds above a conscious crowd
That stand on radio actives sand
Hundreds of white garments bow
Beneath the moon is the barn owl
Land of the black alien wizards
Alpha Dracon star human seas, Luciferians and mystics
Priest the autoraptatrone, the megaspitacron
The grand mic holder, the HipHopgrapher niggergon
Melaninated wars, he elevated from floors
Back into the light holding a mic
Through metal spaceship doors that hover the lake fog
The color of ideas Everybody loves the sunshine from Roy Ayers
Play em back to back sit back enjoy the spheres
