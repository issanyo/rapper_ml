Pharoahs..
Pharoahs..
Pharoahs..
It is you that God brought

Places Where Pharoahs Go (Pharoahs)
Mind... (Pharoahs)
The mind, Places Where Pharaohs Go
The mind...
(See you father)

Places Where Pharaohs Go
Places Where Pharaohs Go
Here I am deep in my soul
Here I am walkin on the sand
Talkin to a man in a language that neither he or I understands
Felt painless, though I'm anxious to ask him what his name is
His clothes looked the ancient and his face was ageless
His hand were sacred as if travelled through places
And I was an Atheist until I was greeted by the warm embraces of the local natives
Now I'm in the middle of an oasis singin praises to a gigantic spaceship
Walkin in the middle of a desert, I felt pleasant
While Kings and Queens and men with wings stand in my presence
In their pure essence, now take me to where my ancestors are restin
They begin to take me by my hands and walked on the sands
To the deep wilderness behind the villages
I looked up; we went to a mystic spot
He said, "Here it is, there's the pyramids where your spirit lives"
I walked inside, seen myself as King Tut, layin in a green tux
Wings came out in dusk
I saw mummies moon walking out of their coffins
Then a voice said, "Well done"
Then they greeted me in welcome
The Places Where Pharaohs Go
Places Where Pharaohs Go
Places Where Pharaohs Go
Which word best describes this urge?
I refer to a proverb, observe the third optic nerve
It moves clockwork, times stopped but I'm not disturbed
Nothin that you can smell, touch, taste, or even be heard (heard)
The Places Where Pharaohs Gos
