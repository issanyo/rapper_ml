(George Plimpton)
What would you like people to think about you when you've gone?

(Muhammad Ali: "Recipe for Life")
I would like for them to say....he took a few cups of love
He took one tablespoon of patience
One tablespoon/teaspoon of generosity
One pint of kindness; he took one quart of laughter
One piece of concern, and then he mixed willingness with happiness...
He added lots of faith, and he stirred it up well...
Then he spread it and expanded it over a lifetime
And he served each and every deserving person he met!!!!

[Killah Priest]
My soul's on fire, burnin' like the Bush-Moses soul
Broken ghettos, Iraq plan to bring the Holy War
Crusades, religion, blood and death
No love is left, Malcolm wit slugs in his chest, fell
I'm just a thug in the step, Martin marchin' for peace
Sign of the time; behold the Beast, firin' the nine
Code of the street, no talkin'
They lower coffins inside a six feet grows
Yo, this how it goes, cuz we black negros
Life and Death is like a carnival in cemeteries
Ain't nobody left that's honorable they all been buried
The Chronicles, from Muhammad's schools to Gods names vary
Black people are the promised Jew's 'cuz we lost already
My cross is heavy, I carry it - this is my burden
Look at the sky, see chariots, that's why the Earth is just burnin'
The worst is determined, by the birth of a person or off a hurtin'
Soul searchin', I go to the liquor store, I want more

(Muhammad Ali: "Recipe for Life")
He took a few cups of love
He took one tablespoon of patience
One tablespoon/teaspoon of generosity
One pint of kindness; he took one quart of laughter
One piece of concern, and then he mixed willingness with happiness...
He added lots of faith

[Sonny Seeza]
Homie I'm greatly rescind, that escaped in the ruin
We makin' a new State of the Union, the day of improvin'
We major, we movin', so savor the fluent
Slowin' ya hearin', go in ya ear and lettin' you know
You so incomparin', seein' life get much tougher, in my own eyes
Sworn in all gon' suffer, in their own lies
You can find ya self in a crowded room alone wise
Gotta stay one step ahead, those chrome guys
Comin' in force to give you the mark
Make you invisible dark
When the Generals bark, ya interview stops
The hospitals don't save you no more
This is chop-shop
Niggas sellin' all of ya parts befo' you drop
My man, Big Tye' still strong and alive
Upped his heat to military size, look at the time
You get too big; they wanna see you fall from the sky
These days it's better to be certain then suprised
