VERSE I
A time traveller mistakenly kills the older version of himself
A baby grab a Mac 10 from off the shelf
Fighter planes that's coming from the four arms of
A giant flying stealth
God holds up the universe by wearing Orion's belt
The man from God's country
Where the monuments reconstruct themselves
A futuristic mind
Computer design
Modern tech priest nukes the world of crime
Of rogue elders hybrid warriors evolved angels
Pyramids become live volcanoes
Astronauts that found heaven
A crew of convicts and twenty-four scientists
Went their own direction
They discovered a god with a child face
Sitting on a throne with a crown and cape
He held in his hand book of the resurrection
They know on earth land they'll become legends
This Wu technology Wu great minds
Creation of a Killah Priest Wu-Tang designed
Wu-Tang explorers Wu flying saucers Wu-Tang everything
Wu-Tang enforcers
They saw the world to come
The gospel of apostles as blue flares shot from a mechanic sun
They all grabbed their gamma guns
Helmets was hellish
As my Uzi weighs a ton faces angelic
As a throne of fire creation of the Messiah
11 47 hours high-powered
Captain of the tower 51 Stargate a system
The target of victims
Are a new Jerusalem
The iron rust of the craft aluminum
The officers floated through the tube of titanium
Shooting at the creatures with the wide cranium
Sky Mesopotamian
The language that they spoke was Akkadian
As he blinks at the ball of fire
He saw the red rocks the dust filled air
Engineers from the spheres
They called his name Enoch
In his hands was a computer called a Sephirot
The Hebrew astronaut
Landed on an Egyptian planet called Ma'at
They said you're standing on wave fields of consciousness
The feet the black invisible light as the comet is hit
His man said let the monsters talk
It's like Malachi Z York meets Mr Roarke
The plant the plane the mothership lands
Those from heaven to earth they came
Let us make man

VERSE II
A metaphysics student is kicked out of class
For peeping into his teacher's soul
He's only 18 years old
The astral plane it falls asleep it dreams of black holes
Melchizedek on a GPS
Watching my TV set
With OCD and it's in HD
Thief goons riding through sand dunes
To the Skull Woods with their power gloves
Overlord followed by wolves
With their horned headdres like a bull
Nine Bronze Age
The older gods struggling with the priest
And they're warring
The kingdoms grew violent
Over time after the war it was silence
The older kings blood rivalries and beliefs
Hit the streets
The prince is dead
The priest convinced it was the plagues
The sky was dark blue bleeding into purple
A hundred thousand demons feeding on her virtue
Spitzer space telescope
We saw the falling craft leave a trail of smoke
The man from God's country has a power glove
I can feel the emotions in water
Can punch out demons
