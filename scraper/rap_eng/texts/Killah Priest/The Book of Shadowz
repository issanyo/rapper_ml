[Intro: Killah priest]
Yeah, as the door close inside the sanctuary another one opens
Aslan and Killah Priest and the Book of Shadows
The lion family lives on (book of shadows x3)
Yeah, light the black candles
Killah priest the Iron Sheik, the whole Wu-Tang Family

[Hook: samples]
Nocturnal, I stroll where the darkness go
I write rhymes in pitch black
Nocturnal, I stroll where the darkness go
Red dragons, can't even fuck with my brain pattern
[2x]

[Verse 1: Aslan]
I cause 7 plagues over the land and bring a damn flood
The devils curse your first born, mark your door with the lambs blood
Hope it passes over, feast on unleavened bread
Cause I won't stop till I'm taking the beast 7th head
The Black Hebrew I wear the charms of a scarab beetle
I pray the staff of Moses and grab my Arab people
The witch doctor (What?) check my cauldrons for me
Now you heard the stories of the sorcerer that walks on water
???? up close, read forgotten scrolls and lost journals
A nocturnal warlock, I draw the crop circles
A black sire riding chariots of fire
Never step to me forever ready to stake a vampire
I see you lunatics are howling at the moon
Bury you down in the blackened tomb of an underground catacomb
Sending adversaries to the dungeons of Hell
I let the boatman at the river sticks ferry you to the underworld

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Skull and crossbones, tombstones, a womb grown enormous
Metamorphasis inside the month is black august
Horse bit, dormant torment, Torah author, I wrote torture, scorch ya
Meet the holies of holies as the scroll reads in a empty graveyard
Grey fog surround me cloudy, owls in the trees
Wolves prowl through the leaves, howl
A tabernacle of jackals of black wolves, statues move
The Saint Matthew tattoo written across my abdomen
Like the roman letters written across the walls of the Vatican
The sabbath end the wrath of men, the night drift black as the wind
Big great stone church, 8 hooded rabbis read from a verse
A Basic Instruction Before Leaving Earth
The evening is cursed, paintings of Mary receiving birth
Demons burst when I start breathing the verse
King of kings, priest, the lord of lords
Wings unseen, swords of war
Priest slay the evil horde, which is the beast
Hebrews sing on one accord
According to the Book of Life the earth shook that night
Like the cold cool nails push through the palms of Christ
I write, his blood drips through my ink
Judas picks up a cup and drinks, stars in sync about the sphinx

[Verse 3: Aslan]
I speak the 9 evils, spit verses darker than Christ features
For idiots stupid to worship white Jesus
Use to be judges now they serve Nike and Adidas
Babylonians got an army of sodomites like Caesars
Turn the kingdom to a pit of ASSULT
Like to see you Sodom ---crush your seed
Sit in a temple burning weed like king Solomon
360 divided by 3, the mathematics
85ers caught cipher with me I spit that black magic
Use symbolic architecture, not the work of a mason
You will never catch me serving the church worshiping Satan
Cause I'm like Canaan, but I'm not pagan, cremate 'em
Put their ashes in a urn, place 'em in the dirt and raise 'em
That's my word, aim and kneel and say 50 hail Mary's clutching your rosary
I'm unholy seeing devils come close to me
The Hell raiser, spell breaker, self-savior
Tell your maker I'm coming to punish your gender
Worlds in danger

[Hook]
