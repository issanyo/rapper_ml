(Priest talking)
It's been a long time Solomon let's get 'em...

[Solomon Wise]
The story of life, the story that moves you
Hold on tight to the melody that soothes is usual
I looked through the eyes of man, woman, and child
I couldn't find a good time and I ask why they don't smile?
Find it hard to believe while we hardly communicate
Strike up, talk to conversate
Like sox as a young buck commonly relates
We're in harm's way and in a frantic state
Constantly made to look down
As we allowed a world to go around
While we walk on stolen grounds
Unfold the truth it's the easy part
But when the greedy start
We don't see how easily they break her hearts
Make her mock, take a stand
I shake hands with a man who creates art
By telling the children while they're killing
I fill her mouth, as a son asks about guns
Daughters get slaughtered in our slums
Is there someone's fund that can protect us from police?
'Cause even the Beast prays on the weak
Can't remember what it is to speak
They can't remember what it is to be free
It's deep thoughts in my sleep
They keep me up all night with poor sighted of the innocent
They said it's all right but we know it isn't
I wanna live in an infinite world with love
Where skies the limit, the limit that's in it is above

(Chorus) Uncredited female singer
I can't live a lie
Sometimes in my mind
Not scared from the time
Sometimes I fly
Sometimes I fly away
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry at always
Sometimes it rains
And we're all just a sunshine away from a brighter day

[Killah Priest]
Fallen from grace, burnt wings, Angels pouring from space
Upon our planet from the Lord's vase
Hell catches us till I exodus out the modern Egypt
I see an e-clipse; a man preaches
America is 6-6-6 arithmetic
May our feet not slip in the devil's grip
Whose ghetto is this?
I pray for every real cat in the grave
Who got hit by a stray
My own demons torture me, they tell me crude things
Till I turn to a king, Priest Solomistic, linguistic
Hieroglyphic pictures of all my niggas at the Last Supper
Sipping on the killer, Solomon

[Solomon Wise]
In the mind state and the state of mind we in
We only in it to win from beginning to end
Backwards started from a poet with a pen
A rhyme with a reason, a sign with a season, breathing
Don't forget to breathe out, leave out the frustration
For such a face shouldn't have impatience
Such a lovely nation, ashamed the Government cuts our circulation
I can see the hurting faces
Traces of a false education, but instead of dictation
I patiently wait for those to give their own shit of tasting
No time for hating, sooner or later we wait for Savior
Or you can save yourself now then save your neighbor
Till that time do me a favor hold your composure
Even though it seems major it's almost over

Keep on moving on, the streets is thee genome
We keep our believes so strong
We keep on holding on
We keep on moving on
We keep on moving on
We keep on moving on
We keep on moving on

(Chorus) Uncredited female singer x2
Sometimes I fly
Sometimes I fly away
Sometimes I cry
Sometimes I cry at always
Sometimes it rains
And we're all just a sunshine away from a brighter day
