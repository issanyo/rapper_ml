[Intro: Killah Priest]
Bad person, in the underworld
The bad persons are the bad egg
A bad news, a bastard, a black sheep, the black god
All the vagabonds, thieves, the bums, the mask of the cowards
Villains, the criminals, the scoundrels, robbers, the racketeerers
The Angel said...

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Look at the killers, dealers, scramblers, hustlers, pimp
Tho lives are running, police coming, gunning, jumping over fences
Hide in trenches, fight, defenses, ducking bullets
This is that hood shit, show more footage, speak from pulpits
(Fellow Americans, you are now under a new era, A New World Order)
We're all the same as Angels, watching, ain't no stopping
Sky's crack, You lie back, watch, you're in, burning skin, turning in
Hell bound, hell hound, with scales down, 'til their tails ground
Chasing us, barking, we're darking, dropping revolvers in the apartments
Here comes the Marksmen up the stair case, I start busting backwards
Slipping, where is the Pastor? Too many distractions, 9/11
Signs from Heaven, find a weapon, AK, SK, HK's, MK
Mayday, mayday, mayday, rocket launchers, my project's bonkers
We sold drugs 'til it's over, it's time to close up
Yup, let's go, closure, judgement day, thugs will spray
Devil's is running, 'cause they'll realize something worse then Hell is coming
A black bird burning down until it turns to a fire breathing dragon

[Chorus 2X: Killah Priest]
Look at the things we done, (OH MY, MY, MY)
We live like dangerous, (JUST DRY YOUR EYES)
Until the Angels come, (OH MY, MY, MY), for us

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
It seems like, a giant hologram of the President's head above my projects
Or the night crawling down like a Panther from a tree where the fog sets
Where you hear whisper out from the darkness, like we've survived
Yo, yo, come here, shorty, shorty, shorty, come here, come here
I got something here for you; Priest beloved, immortal
Travel through portals, behold the Pharaoh before you
I was once a radical poor dude that stood on the corner
Teaching blacks we're the Lost Jews
Why? 'Cause my people's were deprived of Yale and Law Schools
Now they walk around with a head full of lost screws
Never been into rabbit's foots or horse shoes
Or superstitions trying to make me lose my vision
Look up, the nukes are in position

[7th Ambassador]
Repute the system, our people are too conditioned
Too persistent, many will come, a few will listen
Razah, Priest, and Obadiah, a new dimension, chose your henchmen's
Crucial business, lunaticing 'til the roots of lineage

[Chorus 2X: Killah Priest]
Look at the things we done, (OH MY, MY, MY)
We live like dangerous, (JUST DRY YOUR EYES)
Until the Angels come, (OH MY, MY, MY), for us

[Verse 3: Hell Razah & Kilah Priest]
We're surrounded by... Births, abortions, churches, organs
Don't bury me; these Romans will only dig up my coffin
We was orphans who was born into wars and slave auctions
(KKK) Better pray for the day they burnt them crosses
We're the spooks who threw them torches up inside the Bush's office
Wicked forces, Kissed their daughters and sons
And take precaution, now the Priest released this Offering
Renaissance, we're born again, my pen drip the ink for the sinks
Blood of the Sphinx, kissed my eye, wool on his head
While I feed him unleavened bread
Point the infrared on enemies who wish to see me dead
The Pope opened up and read... "Revelations" Then he blared:
"I met an Angel" and he said To drop the gun that's on my leg
I rolled up out of my bed, walked on synagogue floors
My house, Cathedrals, ceilings with Egyptian walls
My diner room, Last Supper style, twelve chairs with King Tut cuts
Cave bathrooms and medieval towels

[Chorus 2X: Killah Priest]
Look at the things we done, (OH MY, MY, MY)
We live like dangerous, (JUST DRY YOUR EYES)
Until the Angels come, (OH MY, MY, MY), for us

[Outro: Killah Priest w/ distorted voice]
Ha, ha, ha, ha, where are you're going? You ain't going nowhere
Bring your asses to me, you're coming with me tonight
Ha, ha, ha, ha, you're coming with me
1And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit
And a great chain in his hand. 2And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent
Which is called the Devil, and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years, 3And cast him into
The bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive
The nations no more, till the end of a thousand years be fulfilled: (Rev. 20:1â€“3 KJV)
Ha, ha, so where do you think you're going nigga? Where do you think you're going nigga?
Where do you think you're running to nigga? You're coming with me, all your asses are coming with me
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, I own you, I own you for a thousand years, Till The Angels Come
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, you rappers, you sold your fucking life for over to me you bastards
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, This is the stroll for the apocalypse, you bastards
'Nah'mean?, so while you're walking in your motherfucking cars, sexing these bitches
Spending your fucking money, going to these god damn clubs, it'll be me motherfucker, in the end
