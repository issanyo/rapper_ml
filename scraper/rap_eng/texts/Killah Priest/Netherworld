Killah Priest: Yo what up man, it's Killah Priest. Wu-Tang Clan, shout out to Tones Bad Karma and HI-Q. You have now entered the Netherworld

What would I do without Hip-Hop man? It's all I got

I won't be deceived if I see what I believe
A concept I kept with me since before I was conceived
The metaphors perceive they own universe
And put words to the music but the truth it hurts
It's been awhile (right), now I'm able to smile
While men are stuck living wild since the days of a child
I've calmed down, put on sounds meditate for peace of mind
When I freestyle, close my eyes speak the lines
You just read your rhymes off your phone you're no killer
Tones wacko, must be rolling tobacco he got no filter
But I'm the same person in person and still searching
Lurking on the under, beneath a different version
So you can check on the web but never get what I said
I recommend you listen close cause every letters meant
Spoke in sentiment, let my brother rest
Everyday I wake up to another test

Hook: Hold your weight. I take the long way 'round. I find my own way down, as I should

I ride the sail for my brethren with souls that's frail
Judge denied my bail now I'm laying here broke in jail
It don't fail, searching for the path all day
It's like this always, fuck it I'll take the long way
It's hard to say what I'm feeling inside
There's no words to describe being really alive
If it wasn't for this feel like I wouldn't exist
Live how I should it's a gift while I'm looking off cliffs
Or at the ocean with an el lit, this story I'm a tell it
Don't miss it, watch it as the plot thicken develop
A picture of brilliance shining light by the trillions
To the heavens in a second from the essence stillness
You gotta feel this, these ain't drums this is love over beat
It got the realest touch, it make my soul complete
It's so unique how I speak, style and create
Years ahead of, you never catch up while we wait

(Hook)

Blinded by the misconceptions, timing in the presence
Find in all the directions, aligning with descendants
The remnants of a better past for those that never laugh
Can't deal with what you feel, keep it real let it pass
Forever ask why, don't ever let them convince you
From thinking for yourself, talking to yourself what you've been through
It's all a struggle, and we all the lower class
A debt owed from gold, being sold for cash
I checked the forecast it read destruction of the planet
Handcuffed to the panic, suffered the damage
I can't manage to get a grip on saving the earth
I barely escape being a slave to the words
And it's making it worse when dwelling on the negative
Remind myself to stay positive while the hook is repetitive
This book is edited by the world's deepest poet
Don't just live for now Tones you got to be the moment

(Hook)
