I really like peace, but niggas only understand war
So I'ma give 'em what they lookin' for
Either I, or, you got guns, man, but we got more

[Victorious]
Peep the bloodline, you dig I'm royal
A hundred women for the roster, best believe they loyal
No, spoil you outta all your chicks admit it
Y'all know vedic, spit it, but won't admit it
Shit it, cock sucka anybody can get it
Uh, bucky eye, black six she rollin', I put five in
You and that bitch you hoin'
Put the pound in your anal dukes, split you cold
Cuz ain't a damn thang gon' stop my team
All hail when I pop my thang, black-on-black 16's
Shit's mean, hit's king, pop, dome on the block, known
Wrist gleam, Glock, chrome on a hot phone
Crist clean like out ya ass, you heard?
Bitch nigga but I'm for the cash
Out for the longevity baby, out to last
Out for the luxury livin' playa
Out to mass, out for the young
Black entrepreneurin', ask ya aunt if I'm ballin'
I thug it out dick and I'm out for the warnin'
First draft pick, off the bench and I'm scorin'
We gettin' big money now for them chicks who shit it
Pretty thug nigga wit chips, official wit it
Thug-thug G nigga, admit you did it
Cuz I'm comin' for the throne, my gun rinse who in it
You gon' be mad when I'm in a CL Benz Coupe tinted
And I don't smoke weed, don't need to be high to be a gangsta
I'm authentic, winter gel two to vibe for my anger
Your girl outta pocket, lookin' in the eyes of a stranger
You whylin', ridin' for danger, headed for trouble
Plottin' you blame her? Might of saw me
Pottin' wit bangaz, Riker's Isle you heard niggas, C-74
9-5 still live up in Beverly morgue
Beverly Hills, glocked wit the heavenly steel
You betta be real, clock infrared at ya grill
A hundred G's none playa? We headed for mills
Millions for the children
Rebuildin', mirrors speakers on the ceilin'
You tweakin' up the feelin'
Brown skin, chinky eye, got 'em leakin' off the drillin'
Uh, yeah, leakin' off the drillin'

[Interlude] Victorious
I don't really wanna hurt nobody
It's to easy for me to hurt somebody
It's too easy for me

[Killah Priest]
I understand how to handle these niggas
Or put a hand on these niggas
Or their dawgs, or their family members
But what I do is call a meetin' wit their head of their teamin'
Ask 'em clearly, what's the beefin'?
What is their meanin'?
My faculty heard some shit that got back to me
We tryna keep it Godly, please no more bodies
Poppin' up out the rivers, courtesy of my niggas
And they don't like movin' abruptly
They quick to buss B
Y'all niggas touch me, we throwin' cocktails
Hot curls, cartels, OG's secret Roswell
Niggas mad cuz we walk wit Jesus like Kanye
And we talk like Yahweh Ben Yahweh wit an AK
And the gauge at ya rib cage
Come at as wit ya gentiles style and ways
I'm the nigga they hated like King David
I write psalms then I grab arms, the bravest!
