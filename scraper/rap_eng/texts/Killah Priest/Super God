(We need help… we need help…Please)
I’ll save you. (Priest, help us!)
Here I come to save the Rap-World
(Super God, Super God)
Up-up and away, down-down here we go…
(Super God, Super God)
Super God
PriestHood!!!!

From off the planet of a million years
Standing on a beginning point
I’m forever bursting into a billion spheres
In a vehicle faster than the speed of light
Then he turns his headlights on…
Dodging meteorites, passing strange life forms
Robotic movement in his right arm
Cyborg text work on his writing palm
Black oil spill from his electric grill
His glide like the movie Tron
Great Scott, Mother Mary, The Coat of Arms
What’s the speed of dark?
I'm lighten if it didn’t zig-zag
I stuck my hand in the witch bag

Come on, Super Gods
(Super Gods)
Super Gods, he’s with the Super Gods
He’s with the Super Gods

Hero of the ring
Pillows sit between
In flow, spit supreme
Nero fit the scenes
I saw lighten in the day time
A sure sign
Two pictures beside me
The Grey kind
One called C-O3-64
The other don’t speak, just says “N.E.E.K.-N.E.E.K.-N.E.E.K.”
We were approached by this dummy
Who wanted to battle, I ate money
Knew he was a clown cause he taste funny
I told him light travel faster than sound
That’s why you appeared bright as before you spoke
Then record to him a joke
I’m back to the desktop
I call it work-shop
Where the fake world end
And scientifical words drop non-stop

Super Gods, (Super Gods)
(Super Gods I’m telling he’s masterful, he’s one of the illest!)
(Yo, we the Super Gods)
(Priest,)
Yes…
(Tell them how you never existed… the scientific break-down of your name…)
Killa-bee
Latitude
Longitude
Altitude
Helium
Protons
Rotate
Ions
Electrons
Space
Tailwinds
Whirl wind
Merlin
Hell pen
Pearl gem
Burling
What’s that swooping from afar? A shooting-star?
No, it’s Super Gods

Super God, (Super God)
Super Gods, (He’s Super God)
(He’s Super God, He’s Super God)
Great Scott, (He’s tearing up the city!)

Alright then, I’ll be back for more…
Priest I want to stop this madness…
Enter The Psychic World and The Super God
The Story of Billy Manson…
I time called forever…

(And we out…)
