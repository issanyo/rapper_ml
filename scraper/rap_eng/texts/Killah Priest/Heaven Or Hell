Galactic frames, starship around my wrist and ring
Play your orbit Norbert, my mind's in different planes
Ya slander, I shoot gamma rays
Planet of the apes, the monkeys know my name
Victory rocket gun blam in your face
I lounge under the cameras in space
What's today's mathematics? What's the rage across the planets?
My words, the blunts for ya ear's canvass
The crayon for your mind's colouring pamphlet
Priest-anthics my thesis, I build it like Egypt
Ability increases, my mic possess the soul of all living creatures
Crawling out the black waters
Falling from the furthest of the orbits, his name is Walter
Amongst the New Yorkers and slick talkers
To the followers of underworld crime, to the gangsters regions of mind
That wears a heart of caves for legions inside
To the shooters that decrease the future
This not the same old street shit that your used to
I'm here to bring Heaven and Earth, put the Devil back in the dirt
Pull up Leviathan's skirt capture the first slave master
Make the US tanks reverse, I'm too fast for y'all kids
Every time I blink I read new data on the back of my eyelids
It's Priest the 5th kingdom
Every second a dynasty rise in my mind, I spit so you can see them
A throne on my tongue that sits a king for telling what to come
A thousand years of blackness for rappers who don't practice
My rap lift like the mother hover craft
I kill four hundred emcees, call me The Number Man
Understand I'm talking to you like Uncle Sam
It's the Son of Man, I talk with the mouth of Jesus
My brain cell produces ether, that pours from my skin like juice
On the stoop with pharaoh features in the 'Psychic World of Walter Reed'
I'm talking in 3D, it's bought as a CD
And I'm giving one away free, so what you like?
