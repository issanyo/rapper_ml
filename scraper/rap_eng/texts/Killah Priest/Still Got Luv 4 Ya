[Intro: Killah Priest]
Still got love for you...
I still got love for you...
I still got love for you...
I still got love....
Still got... I...
Still... got... love for you
Still got love for you
Still got love for you
Still got love for you
And I know, that you got love for me too
It's in the spirit...

[Killah Priest]
Though it's hard to understand you, my love
I send you a dove, sweet melodies & motions above
Jo' we almost a same, I soak in the rain
Calling your name, passions from past time
Float through my brain, from your neck to your solarplex
And know enough sex, your shoulders and breath
Heaven blessed, I can rest every part with the art
Before we depart, I got something to say

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
I still got love for you
The kind that'll make your blood boil
Our love, will always be royal
Plant my seeds inside your fertile soil
And when I dug in, I struck oil
I still got love for you
Huh, I still got love for you
Uh, I still got love for you

[Killah Priest]
Your my love, my black pearl, my girl
A ruby, you're all my jewelry
Your hair smells like pear
I love it when your in underwear
I go in your brassiere
Though you left me, my dear
I know one day you will return
In my stomach there's a flame that burns
And a pain that yearns, but I adore you
I still got love for you

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
Baby, I love your instructions
The way you got me sucked in, I'll start nuttin'
Diggin' your back out, yo, until I blackout
It's so deep, I can't write it down
Cuz the way that I'm feeling now
My heart just pounds, like a rock upon the ground
Cuz the way that I'm feeling you
Is always been true
I eat your fruit, you sip my juice
It's so deep, I won't get no sleep
At night, I can't even rest
Thinking about you on my chest
Baby, meant to be together forever
Yo, no matter what's the weather
We will go through the storm
We will carry on, and on and on
We will carry on, and on and on
I got love for ya

[Chorus]

[Killah Priest]
Baby, you just got to understand
These demons, they got the upper hand
But if you wait, I'mma show you the plan
Will show you how to stand
Against the trials & tribulations
Yo, ain't no tribute to Satan
Forget them cats, just let them keep hating
I'm talking to your spirit
And I know you could feel it
If you out there, and if you care
Yo, give a nigga a call
Sometime, baby, sometime, sometime
Cuz you on my mind, sunshine, sunshine

[Outro: Killah Priest]
I still got love for you
The kind that make your blood boil
Not the kind that make you royal
You bitch, you should of never hurt my feelings
Now I gotta start killing...
