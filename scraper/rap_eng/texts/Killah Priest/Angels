First came the wings, then the angel
His spirit actually appeared to you?

[Intro: Killah Priest]
Word, know what I'm saying?
Straight up. I gotta talk to y'all about angels right now
(Don't be bugging) I dunno if you be knowing that you having them all around you?
Protecting you, angles, just wanna talk about angels
Something different we ain't discussed

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Yo, Angels Elohim in the skies, fly with eagle wings
Angels Elohim in the skies, fly with eagle wings
Angels Elohim in the skies, fly with eagle wings
Angels Elohim in the skies, fly with eagle wings

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
First Genesis mislead us, fist of all
We have to discuss who is the us
Who helped form the man from out of the dust
Who helped make the lands and fill the sea up? It was us
In greater form, we helped create the storms
That take newborns and embrace them in their arms
They hold harps and play God his favourite songs
Touch the heart and make it warm
They taught the preachers, they sit on ether
Some say they touch women in the bleachers give them seizures
They fight demons, they like creeping
Angels, they govern kingdoms, yo come on

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Angels, they brought the message from the heavens
Confused man about immaculate conception
They dress in all black in their presence
They know the answers to mans questions, while he's questing
The cherubim in the jeroboam
Man should cherish them, but don't worship them
Why? 'Cause they here to service men
Angels, they walk with plain clothes never let their wings show

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Angels in which you imprisoned, show us visions
Play with your children, introduce us to women
They surround leaders and politicians
Acknowledged by Christians, followed by wisdom you can hear them
They could be around you right now, sitting with their wings hidden
The ghosts of the night drifting, float on the night skipping
Put my soul in conviction
Just listen to the energy, channels into the angels, come on

[Hook]
