[movie sample]
Our reason for fighting is this..
We were only meant to fight in one war only
That battle between the sons of light..
And the sons of darkness, ordained by God
That is our service
Now we see that this is that battle and we will fight..
Under your command

[Killah Priest *humming the beat during sample*]
Priesthood..

[Verse 1]
I stepped in a church ashamed, naked and hurt
Wet from the rain, my face shows pain
I'm desperate in search for answers
Grabbed the pamphlet that the ushers handed
Blood stain shown through my shirt
Cause beneath, my arm was bandaged
I walked up the aisle but didn't stop 'til I got the altar
I was being blocked by the preacher's supporters
But he'd seen my torture
So-called friends filled me with false love
I spoke "Sorry I have nothing to offer
But lost hope and an empty soul"
See the Devil tempts me like Jobe, everything I had I now owe
He took my girl, shook my world, lost my crib
It was all his except for my kids
That's what I thought 'til I'm at court with my wiz
She doubled-crossed me then slid
She forced me to live in solitude now the bottle's my food
I follow no rules but if the gospel is true
Then I'm his apostle like you
But he stopped me cold and called me a fool
He said I was rude the way I'd intrude
Then I tossed him this jewel..

[Chorus]
The greatest thing I've ever known..
Greatest thing I've ever known..
The greatest lesson ever learned..
The greatest lesson ever learned..
Most precious thing I've ever owned..
Most precious thing I've ever owned..
Though it left it shall return..
Though it left it shall return..
All I know is what I've known..
All I know is what I've known..
The greatest lesson ever learned..
The greatest lesson ever learned..
Most precious thing I've ever owned..
Most precious thing I've ever owned..
Though it left it shall return..
Though it left it shall return..

[Verse 2]
You judge me but what would you do if you was me?
If you saw through my eyes
If you've felt the pain that I've felt inside
What would you do? Would you cry?
Ah, thought so, I do sometimes..
See you have a home and a swimming pool, the big backyard (yeah?)
Large living room, fed with a silver spoon
You probably sinning too but don't know
Pardon me if I'm offending you but I won't go
I question my faith, been in a depressional state (yeah man)
Self-hate, one day blessings will wait
Stared death in his face, planning my 'scape
I've seen D's stretching out tape
I've 'visioned prison dates, injected with the venom of snakes
Women with grapes, slept with in rooms pyramid-shaped
Walls covered with hieroglyphics, I'm far from religious
It was said in my first introduction
Which was Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth
For me it went deeper than just reading a verse
Seeing it first, I needed work

[Hook]

[Outro: Killah Priest]
You know it's real, K.P
The picking cot had been lockened
Daily..
