[Verse 1]
8 o'clock, the door knocks
Black wakes up, grabs his Glock
Looks for his girl and his man Scott
Scott at the door with the nine cocked
His girl grabs the box, she tells him "Meet me at the other spot"
Blows a kiss, hits the back window and hops
Black runs over toward Scott, "How they figure our plot?"
Then far away, they both hear shots
Thoughts of his girl shook his world
He scream "Cassandra!" then dropped
The scenes just stopped, the camera pops

[Verse 2]
Earlier, 7:55, Scott's peeking through blinds
He sense a set up, so he reach for his nine
Looks at his man, Black, on the couch sleep
He's out deep, in the background this loudmouth freak
She's filing her nails, sucking her teeth
She saying "Y'all should've followed me to my spot
Through the woods, it's right up the street"
He said "I know" then, and then they both paused
He said, "Shh, I hear a car's pulling up near the door"
He called Black, he called him once, twice
But he didn't react, look at the clock
It struck 8 o'clock, then he heard a knock
Nine cocked at the door, Black calling his name
Heard something in the back, sounds strange
Heard the mumbles, box, fumble
He quickly look back, saw Black staring out a window
What the fuck, Black runs over asks him "How they figure the plot?"
Then they both heard shots, Black face stood up, he screamed and just dropped
Scott opened up the door firing shots said "Fuck it", shot in the leg
The scene just stopped, the camera pops

[Verse 3]
Earlier, up early, 7:30, mad worry
She's thinking, thoughts sinking
About her in cuffs in the precinct
All because of that box, she kept a good watch
On the door and the lock
Her man that she met not too long ago named Black is out on the couch
They all in the house, the toilet flush, Scott comes out, the bathroom
She said "Excuse me", he's mad rude, G
He gave her the quiet side, took out his nine
She said, "What the hell, you keep acting nervous, oh well"
Took out a nail filer, and start filing her nails
She heard a knock, then Black called her name
Her filer had dropped, she grabbed the box
She said, "Meet me at the other spot, love you"
Jumped out the window, into the cold
She's running in fear, then she hears "Freeze!"
She slip, falls, drops to her knees, gets up runs
The police shoots, in hot pursuit
Running through the woods, trying to make it to a stoupe
Then she hears a couple of shots
Coming from the house she's just escaped back a couple of blocks
Then she finally makes it to her spot
Along with the box
The scene just stops, the camera pops

[BRIDGE]
The time, 8:15, ahead
Scott's bleeding from his leg
Black is on his knees in a daze
Police raid
He said "I don't wanna be this way
I don't wanna live without my whiz'"
Put he Glock to his wig, then pulled the trigger
Cops surround the body of a stupid nigga

[Verse 4]
Two weeks prior, Cassandra's in police uniforms in the line of fire
Acting coach, wearing wires, FBI showing pictures of one Michael AKA Black Washington
And one Scott Peterson, and how she should meet with them
While eating out with the co-workers
She didn't notice Scott staring at her while she was ordering burgers
She didn't notice Scott always alert with the burner
She didn't notice that he soon will have her murdered
I guess at the time it didn't concern her
Now rewind this song, see if this picture is perfect
