[Intro: Killah Priest]
They got a problem now
There's like, too many corny rappers
Pretenders (put a end to you)

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
There's too many phony MCs out there this year
They best to beware
I've burnt thousands already
So get ready, lyrics are deadly
There's too many phony MCs out there this year
They best to beware
I've burnt thousands already
So get ready, lyrics are deadly

[Verse One: Killah Priest]
Niggas keep fronting, ain't saying nothing
Killah Priest remains calm yet carry on
Go 'head sing your song, claim y'all the dons
Rap superstars look cute with your cigars
Bitches like that but where your mics at?
Bite me I bite back, plus I break backs
Fuck it, you can sue me, from yours truly
When niggas sound booty
There's too many rappers in the East wanna be gangsters
Too many gangsters in the West wanna be rappers
Bunch of actors, I ought to smack ya
Who's your master?
Sit down take a lesson, stop guessing
For years I had grace, saw your mad face
That only showed bad taste, run around like you're delirious
Foaming from the mouth like you're furious
I'd rather be serious it keeps the audience curious
These fantasies are nothing for your fans to seize
It might cause casualties
Hollywood is not your neighborhood
And if it is, give the mic to Natalie Woods
And y'all can be off to see the wizard
The wonderful Wizard of Oz, which are the A&R's
And you and Toto, doing promos along with the Scarecrow
You will see no dough

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
There's too many phony MC's out there this year
They best to be aware
I've burnt thousands already
So get ready, my lyrics are deadly
There's too many phony MC's out there this year
They best to beware
I've burnt thousands already
So get ready, my lyrics are deadly

[Verse Two: Killah Priest]
I lay in the cut like peroxide
Looking at you cock-eyed 'cause your music sounds lopside
They sound tongue-tied
Bunch of young guys, have 'em hung high
Watch their lungs fry from the sunshine
Which is one rhyme generating from the mind
Killah Priest now or late, I terminate
I burn and break and intimidate
I come cold as when the winter break
I put an end to snakes, pretenders and fakes
Shake like a earthquake, I judge wisely
Between two pillars of poison ivy
For those that despise me, attach 'em to the I.V
Your pops should've bust you on the couch
Or sent you down the mouth
Next time wear a condom, when I step upon them
I make MCs memories
Whenever there's a symphony, I look sinfully
Been doing this for centuries
I write shit sick as Shakespeare tripping off of acid
Roll on you like John the Baptist with the rusty hatchet
I preach the word of God before I murder y'all
I swear I never heard of y'all
There's too many MCs out there..

[Hook - overlaps last line]
There's too many phony MC's out there this year
They best to beware
I've burnt the thousands already
So get ready, my lyrics are deadly
There's too many phony MC's out there this year
They best to beware
I've burnt thousands already
So get ready, my lyrics are deadly
There's too many phony MC's out there this year
They best to beware
I've burnt thousands already.. {*fades out*}
