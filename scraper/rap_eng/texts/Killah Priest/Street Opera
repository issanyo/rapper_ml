[Intro: Killah Priest & Hell Razah]
Gates Ave, back in the day, times, struggles
940 in the ghetto
Going through hell to come out right
This is what we must go through to reach heaven
This what we go through to reach heaven
To escape hell ha

[Hook: Hell Razah]
In the Days of Our Lives we got One Life to Live
As the World Turns around negative and positive
At the edge of the nights, The Guiding Light
That leads to Another World
For the Young and the Restless beware of your Deathwish
To All My Children in the General Hospital
The most impossible
We got for you the final saga of the Street Operas

[Verse: Killah Priest]
In my location is where they run the operations
You either stuck or getting bucked by the train station
Word is bond if beyond after dawn
They hit you up bad and watch you drop and they gone
They 9 mms, make bitches scream high-pitch like a tweeter
But shorty is a strong believer when he hold his heater
I use an ounce of my mind to make rhymes
And a half of brain to cause rain
'Cause life is like a game with no instructions
Streets they be tussling to have a brother busting
The adolescence carry weapons in they section
A wrong direction, when they all pack protection
Forgotten knowledge, is all symbolic
And hedonistic, they need statistics, for cops to search
They pop you first and dig your pockets later
And maybe catch you for money or your pager (give me that!)
Or slice your throat with the razor.. *echo*
An old man told me once, sitting on a chair rolling a blunt
"I had a son your age, that ended up on front page
From the impact of a 12-gauge
His assassination drove me in a world of hatred
Today is hard to face it"
He shown me old flicks, "he was up for a scholarship
Today is hard to swallow it
Damn, I never thought life could be so short
I still see him on a basketball court
The bullet took a part of me, the doc said it hit the artery
Every now and then it bothers me
And all the prayers that I gave God
Wouldn't bring him from the graveyard"
That's when he took his picture
And said, "young buck the streets'll get ya
It's either that or the price of liquor
Even me, I learnt as the days grew
That death is only a stage of phase two
Thank Allah that he made you"

[Hook x3: Hell Razah]
In the Days of Our Lives we got One Life to Live
As the World Turns around negative and positive
At the edge of the nights, The Guiding Light
That leads to Another World
For the Young and the Restless beware of your Deathwish
To All My Children in the General Hospital
The most impossible
We got for you the final saga of the Street Operas

[Outro: Hell Razah]
The final saga of the street operas
Of the street operas
The final saga of the street operas
