[Intro]
No monument will mark my resting place. I will leave only this, the story of my life. I have lived fully and deeply. I have tasted passion, crime and even murder. It is for you to judge me. You must weigh the good against the evil, the passion against the tenderness, the crime against the charity, the pleasure against the pain

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
It goes: life, difficult times and mad crimes
Some pay the price, while others refine
Blessed are those who struggle, God loves you
And Wisdom is the principle thing for Kings and Queens
(repeat 2X)

[Verse One: Killah Priest]+
Many of lives will end, it's like a sad song from a violin
Trapped like Daniel's in the Lion's Den
Tryna pierce the iron skin of Leviathan
Souls blowing in the violent winds
God help us, if we die in sin
I hear the trials in the cries of men, that's when the riot begins
Like things never get better, we forever
Serving Nebuchadnezzar since the days of our ancestors
Slaves to a mad pleasure, building great architectures
Sharp dressers, smart professors
Start my lecture, I build lyrics like an art director
Show it to you like the film projector
Blessed Are Those who struggle, from day to day we all hustle
Coming home with sore muscles, scarred faces
Scuffed knuckles, we all share the same trouble
Separated couples, sometimes it seem like
There's no escaping, the clutches of Satan
Spending years in state pens, awaiting patient
Dreams of a scholarship, ended by a hollowtip
Politics and number slips

[Hook]

[Verse Two: Killah Priest

Once shoved in ships, now we Bloods and Crips
Thugs with clips, niggas who love their cliques
Hit the clubs and shit so they can rub their hips
Hugs and flicks, niggas with drugs and whips
Cash Rules this Rotten Apple, they got a worm in it
Corrupt sinners, in my man's Jeep
With the windows tinted, sipping Guinness
Observing all the clinics and liquor spots
They make me lick a shot through the rooftop
I never seen the glory, in the ghetto it's the same story
Cigarette butts and cold coffee
Black faces and white mouths
They cry out, for the White House
Ain't no wealth shared, it's welfare
And poor health care, self scared
It's senseless, the way they got our black princess
On public assistance to end our existence

[Hook]

It's a blessing... to struggle
It's a blessing...
(repeat 2X)
Yeahhyeahhh, it's a blessing, just a blessing
It's a blessing... *fades*
