[Intro: Killah Priest]
Weed and money, weed and money, man

[Chorus 3X: Killah Priest]
Maccabeez, we them killas, man, we them killas, man

[Killah Priest]
Now niggas talk but they don't get to pushing and ducking
Niggas run to duck it, watch this gun, they be busting
Fuck it, end the discussion, give a nigga concussion
Smack 'em like a percussion, now I'm not into tustling
Just revolution and fucking, see the movement is everything
Homies mean nothing, just slicing and cutting
Fuck it, weed and fucking, ya'll niggas need something
My M-16's make ya'll niggas go get thrillers
Swing around like gorillas, killas and drug dealers
Hummers and four wheelers...

[Chorus 3X]

[Hell Razah]
I play the pastor's beside, with a gun in the stash
Running up in CitiBank, with a president mask
It's Maccabeez, be official, take a look at the badge
You don't wanna get shot to rags, taking a bath
Murderville, niggas go home in body bags
Wipe your blood of my Nike, find a party to crash
I'm a mad scientist, when I sit in the lab
Einstein, when I'm dealing with math
Solomon, when I'm dealing with ass
Got a drink, with my name on the glass
Yeah, pour me some more...
Aiyo, I'm sipping on an Absolut vanilla, black nine berettas
The son shine, in all kind of weathers
Summer, Spring or Fall to the Winter
Shaq got play center, and eat up your whole squad like dinner
It's hard to be winner, but God, I am a sinner
Striving to live, but we still rolling them dices
Tray six in c-lo, project casinos
Why ya'll hiding ya'll chain, we ain't Debo
It's Friday, we on a highway, with Priest and Timbo
When Maccabeez hit the club, hit the floor, hit the floor
When Maccabeez... have our dough, have our dough..

[Chorus 3X]

[Killah Priest]
Niggas tricking on chickens, I be spitting my rhythm
Egyptian, exorcism, watch me get in 'em
My mack, it holds the venom, more magazine's split 'em
I'm Emmanuel that's powered, with yayo acrossed the table
Known cats from the 80's, rocking gold cables
Put my dick in your bitch, watch me hit her naval
Bitch won't even be able to walk, because of him
Muthafucka, I'm from Live from New York, Maccabeez, nigga

[Chorus 3X]

[Outro: Hell Razah]
Yeah, Maccabeez album coming soon
Hell Razah, coming soon
My Life: Heaven or Hell...
And if you ain't got that Black August, Killah Priest album
Ya'll niggas was panicking when it was the blackout...
Hahahah... panicking, son, we live this shit
We was ready, baby... down south...
West side, east side, we ride out, we ride out, niggas
Maccabeez, yeah, Priesthood, yea
Robin Hood, nigga, Bo King, nigga, yeah
