Pray for me

[Verse 1]
All I need is this beat and a sheet on my desk
Seven candles around me and the CD/cassette
Maybe you'll pray for my thoughts, silver bow for my sins
A Mac-10 on my rug, now where do I begin
Do I talk about the night that my nephew departed
Do I talk about my wife I never walk down the isles with
Do I talk about the knife that I pulled out from darkness
I'm stepping closer to the light, I feel celestrial and cosmic

Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, pray for me, pray for me
Pray for me, Pray for me, while I pray for you

[Verse 2]
