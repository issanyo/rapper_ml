VERSE I
Hip hop's been altered
Since the Psychic World Of Walter
Now it stands like the Rock of Gibraltar
Hood clips footage of flying saucers
Magi rabbis close the Torah
Fallen angels disguise themselves as planets
Reprogramming from ape man to kings riding a mammoth
Moldavite falling from the heights like it's manna
I heard once you can't serve both God and Mammon
And it all happens on the 3rd rock
Sunspots, graveyards and gunshots
Space gods the ones watch
Nazis flee to the moon, build empires and a space fleet
To return to earth to take police
Camouflage avatars
Mutagen agents
Chasing
Leaving unknown lubricant trails inside the staircases
After two thou hit
Prepare for foulness
Space gear with gods striking our planet with battleships
The stone pharaoh splits
And nuclear lightning left the castle chipped
Left the casles chip light your candlesticks

VERSE II
The CIA plan to murder the evil galactic dictator
Over big paper
Rich gangsters
Diamond traders
Smuggled into the city of the skyscrapers
E pluribus unum is the one-eyed saviour
They massacred millions of African children
Trafficking women
Assassins for emblems
Psychiatric advisers interview the survivors
Books and schools prove to be liars
Crooks rule they move on messiahs
Help gather the unwanted beings
From all the kings in his control
Transport them to this globe (earth)
Beings stacked around the base of volcanoes
While preachers and drug users claim to see the face of angels
Just stuck looking up for months in the same clothes
Memory editing from medicines
Virtue worlds from the heroin
Hold on we just got here let us settle in
Inside the moon is a night club
With trillion watt light bulbs
A green woman took us in and showed us nice drugs
Parents of a young genius killed in a plane crash
We all kneeled before the faces in stainless
Two armies charge and disappear into each other
And where they disappeared a UFO hovers
The god holds the mic
No two MCs flow alike
And no two stones are sodalite
(golden pineapples of the sun
King of the amethyst catacombs
If another ice age grips the earth
Prepare ourselves to fly home)

VERSE III
We went from reading the future in the cosmos
To computer consoles
To every human in a household
Having to have a barcode
Make me wanna leave the condo
And flee back to the Congo
The great Sphinx head of Giza originally portrayed Anubis
The heads of Saint John, Paul and Peter
Under the feet of Seleucus
Then Jesus betrayed by Judas
Then Caesar betrayed by Brutus
Only drink tea when it's made by buddhists
But nowadays teachers betrayed by their students
Drug kingpins are sprayed up by their ruins
In the first modification
Of the god races
Left scars on faces
Spoke through a storm using Mars language
Body cellular network communications
Is an angelic dialog
Multidimensional cities
Reversible the planets of the gods
