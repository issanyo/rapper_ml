[Verse 1: Liquid Stranger]
Coming in from the cold, doing what I’m told
Roaming like a soldier, carry out the order
Hear my ancestor’s voices in my head
Telling me the future government wants me dead
Cause I got the people moving in lockstep
Heavyweight the crew, the skills, the rap
From the belly of the beast I release this heat
Cause even behind enemy lines we shine
Step on my message, break bread at my last confession
Split the sea in half, raise my staff
Hand orchestrate raise ya fist, blaze the shit
Burn these mother fuckers down
Take over the town, I've back to new system
And make em listen to the message in the music, intelligent movement
Make room for revolutionaries ready to ride
Raise a fist to resistance to the sky

[Verse 2: Liquid Stranger]
From the school house to the jail house
We on lock down, take a look around
Everywhere you go video surveillance
Watch ya every move, waiting with patience
Soon as you get out line is when they got ya
Can’t trust anybody, snitches on the block
Jobs not in jails when the stock market fails
Protesters take to the streets against the beast
A collective selected, highly respected
Well connected bringing some next shit, blessed it
Ascended when I grabbed the mic, open up your third eye
Be the breath of life underneath the ground crew run it
How chronic, the cheese I’m the champion I rise
Watch your record sales plummet make move
For revolutionaries ready to ride
Raise a fist in resistance to the sky

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
America’s an abomination George Bush is Satan
The governments a secret society of communist Masons
Vegans run the planet, ozone is damaged
Two wars close to home, kids plagued with famine (what)
His prophecy the economy has fallen like monopoly
Atrocity the beast is calling, I grab a magnum
Crap it and grab it and imagine a severed head
God’s message is spread
I read it and it’s said how the Lord of Babylon
Chopped off his leg and grabbed his heart
And then he wrestled the devil, god bless a rebel
Born in the ghetto saved this song with my metal
Jews suffer daily give me my blanket, give me my turban
Your lives are disturbing you're
Staring at the eyes of the serpent like its god in person
