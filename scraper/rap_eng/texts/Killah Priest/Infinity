Peace, its Priest
Took me a while to find this
I wanna shoutout Jay Elect
And all the Gods..

[Verse: Killah Priest]
Was he born in the cosmos, formed in the fossils
Unified the wheels, left the seal where the crops grow
Left shapes that’s visual, cut by a spiritual lawn mower
Did he walk with the apostles? Talk with the gospel
Disappear in a synagogue, or die in mosque old
Or appear with men of god, or discovered the lost scroll
Was he reborn as Van Gogh, Aristotle or Picasso
Was he formed from New York lights or winds from Chicago
How’s he one man? that sounds like an ensemble
Will they dig him up like charcoal, when they find his soul is part gold
Preserve his mind for millions of years, or display it in an art show
Because the words that he uses, only a few can imagine
At night, when I write, my soul infuses with the Dragon
There’s nothing new under the planet, there’s nothing new under Atlantis
There’s nothing new under the sun, you’re confused with the enchanted
I vibrated out of the universe, at nine thousand terahertz
Sound and light formulated, from matter I was due at birth
The story of every plant, animal and human’s birth
They said they built Sumer first, some say it was Egypt
Let’s reveal the secret, they say Lucy was a priestess
An open letter to the church, more mummies more tombs to search
I’ll be out of sight, out of mind, do the work
And I’ll be back at the end of time and I’ll prove my worth

[Outro: Lecture Extract]
The esoteric fabric of the Universe this is the blueprint, everything in existence comes out of the vibratory state which is called in quantum science quantum mechanics, the unified field

[Outro 2]
What has been will be again and what has been done will be done again, there's nothing new under the sun
We think that we have the leading edge in technology
"We are the apex" of the world civilizations but I don't think this is true
More and more despite the foot dragging and... and the, nay saying by archaeologist and historians and everything else
We are more and more coming to learn that apparently at one point there was a planet-wide highly technical civilization on tthis planet... and something happened
