[Intro: Killah Priest]
This cigar's good
I’m gonna tell a story
Yeah, that's what we’ll do

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
At night the lepers break into the temple
And drink the sacrificial vessel dry, a condor into the sky
Cigar smoke reverse in front of my eyes
Back into my mouth, the fire goes out
My room turns black, the Moon gets fat
Beneath it there are secrets, dealers with crack
Killers with gats, hoodies and cap, I’m out of body
I become the streets breathing through the sewer hole
I am the belt that shooters hold
I became the building that’s chilling, Murals, R.I.P
Across my brick stomach, someone’s coming
Barely could hear what their lips are mumbling
They stash a bag between my bones
Suddenly, I am the bag, holding three crystal stones
The crack inside me yelling they can’t breathe
I tried to use my cemented abdomen to push them free
They told me if they find their supplier, he usually finds a buyer
Then it’s off to the Lighter, the tube of Fire
They said then we become as One
We transform into something strong, a gas, toxic form
From solid to killing brain cells
It’s insane in this hell, so please free us
Fall upon us, crush us to Dust
Just then two fingers grabbed him, one wore a ring
I became a sleeve, the wrist spoke to me
He said his hand's about to freeze
Heard a conservation between a ring, told a story of a finger
Who pushed the trigger for them little killers, we call them rocks
His hand got hot, I became as hard as liver
Yell, "Stop!", he's riddled from shots
His turned dark, I woke up and lit up a bark

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Glory, money, judgement, fame
Demons, temple, alter, the flames
Paradise, Ein Sof Paradise
The Glory, the money, the judgement, the fame
The Demons, the temple, the alter, the flames
Paradise, Ein Sof Paradise

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
When I sleep I dream of deers, a black forest. rivers of blood
Pentagrams on the mirrors of thugs
Scary mares of my enemies filling me with slugs
Haunting my memories, it’s the misery I love
I wake up with prayers under my breath
Make sure the stairs is under my steps
Lately I’ve been writing pages under distress
I want to see the new life that’s promised
I want to see the men who lived honest
I want to see the things of Nostradamus, Prophet Muhammad
I look around; all I see is garbage
Kid searching through a dead man’s pockets
The projects, we try to survive
Why we only ask questions when we high?
I want to see the Messiah's enthronement
I want to see the peace and light on the night of atonement
I want to see Heaven on Earth, the afterlife the rebirth
The Nazarite bring Peace to our turf
I know the Devil want it all reversed
It’s all up in the Universe, but you have to some research
If you a leader of your crew, they wanna kill you
You see higher than your team, they wanna shill you
If you talk about the problems in your hood, they wanna replace you
If you try to do good, they gonna hate you
With this mindstate, what do you do?
What path do you choose? Either way you have to pay dues
They say we all born to lose, we're set up to fail
I’m on my roof top, "Victory!" I yell
Like Obama did it with the girls and Michelle
I look at this government and load up my shells

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Glory, money, judgement, fame
Demons, temple, alter, the flames
Paradise, Ein Sof Paradise
The Glory, the money, the judgement, the fame
The Demons, the temple, the alter, the flames
Paradise, Ein Sof Paradise

[Outro: Killah Priest]
Uh, Let us pray
A story of a man, who told a story of another man
Who told a story of another man
Ein Sof, Keter the Tiferet
You know, the tree of life inside the tree
Look inside
