(feat. Ras Kaas)

Oh so you a killer now?
What part of the game is that?
O so you a thug?
What part of the game is that?
So you sold mad drugs?
O so y'all gangsters now?
What part of the game is that?

[Killah Priest]
First of all everybody can't mc
Second of all, y'all all sound wack to me
Third y'all sound like a group of wannabes
Either it's 2Pac or another B.I.G
Here's the truth for you rappers, be your self
But y'all scared to do that, 'cause won't see no wealth
Matter of fact when y'all leave the ring leave those belts
I ain't gonna stop till every word is felt
See most of y'all cats never bust no gats
And most of y'all cats never sold no crack
And most of y'all cats better thank God for rap
Cause most of y'all left the hood and can't come back
Believe that, niggas ain't trying to see no plaques
Specially if your pockets are fat and theirs is flat
Niggas like an applause, ever heard of gun clap
Ever heard that click clack, rat a tat tat
Damn money what part of the game is that?

So y'all gangsters now?
What part of the game is that?
O so now y'all thugs?
What part of the game is that?
O you sold mad drugs?
What part of the game is that?
O so you killers now?
What part of the game is that?
O you gangsters?
What part of the game is that?
You gotta be something
What part of the game is that?
O you a hustler?
What part of the game is that?

See a lot of y'all cats never been upstate
So why you getting mad and all bent out of shape
Gangster rap? Come on y'all was on roller skates
And now ya trying to blow up on the next man's mistake
I've been broke too long to let a nigga rob me
Be up in your lobby, at least 5 deep
Creep in your crib and pop 5 in your sheet
Pop another one nigga trying to rob me
We ride in these streets, survive in these streets
Niggas get high, niggas die in the streets
Fuck that, I roll up on the side of your jeep
In the range asking for change, hiding my heat
Get smart, I let one fly through your seat
Through your heart, leave a nigga lying beneath
2000 who wanna side with the Priest
And I'm lounging all my niggas playing for keeps

Chorus:
Oh so you Biggie now?
What part of the game is that?
Nah you think you Pac?
What part of the game is that?
Oh you a warlord now?
What part of the game is that?
Hey yo Ras tell em
What part of the game is that?

[Ras Kass]
I'm live evil, I know live people
Anxious to bang you wit heavy metal like Magneto
Now who really on some gangster shit?
Not every nigga with a stomach tattoo, bandanna and a click homey
You ain't dope just 'cause you sniff it, or lace ya blunt with it
That just makes you a wack rapper and a drug addict, get it
These niggas rhyme like they AK spray shit
Sell a ki of yay shit, gotta ride, homicide, every single day shit
Get smacked in the streets by some real nigga who don't play shit
Hit the pavement screaming it's just entertainment
And that ain't it, life sucks like fumigation
My obligation, expose all you funny bunnies
Rappers acting slash fudge packing for the money
'Cause next week if the new fad was hip hop fags
You'll find a lot of these thug niggas in drag, believe that

Oh so you a thug?
What part of the game is that?
Nah you a gangster
What part of the game is that?
Oh now you a killer
What part of the game is that?
Oh now you a warlord
What part of the game is that?
I can't get no money?
What part of the game is that?
