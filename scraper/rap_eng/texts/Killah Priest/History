Killah Priest:

Now hold up, ya'll wanna know whats up with the psychic?
Aight then, new deals on the table
Between the show dates with Ghostface
We listen to old tapes
Distribution for my label
New artists to market
So january, february's dearly departed
Sincerely from the comet

But the diss already, and theres two of them
Wait, this is deadly
Since hiphop to deathly?
Stood by his bedside until the world left me
The crouching tiger, hidden dragon like Jet Li
This is the promise of paradise on mic
To minister with might
Magnificient master of the ceremony
The Holiest of Holies
Pharoah on a throne, in the zone G
I taste the angel blood
Got back in the game
Spit blasphemies
Broke the Baphomet
Left the alter in a circle of flames

Chorus: (Heddy Fur)

The psychic world of Walter Reed
Will make History
It's a victory
(x2)

Killah Priest:

(This is what we're doing this for
Let's get 'im)
The beneficiary of Mary
?scary pagans of satan?
A Mason leads the Nation
Free from agents(/aging)
Illegal pagans and the seed of David
The Beast bathes in the blood of ravens
And fur from rabbits
A black book of magic
And practice with graphics
Cracking the tablets
When I'm tapping in cameras im tapping in planets
And then the Baphomet's back (bat who wears black?)
I rap with a cannon

(you damaged him.. looks good)

(Chorus)
