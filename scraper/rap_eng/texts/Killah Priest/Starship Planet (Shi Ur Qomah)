VERSE I
Mercury thirty-six million miles from the sun
Venus sixty-seven million miles from the sun
Earth ninety-three million miles from the sun
The water in the Nile make it weigh six sextillion tons
Unit followed by twenty-one ciphers
From the caduceus one of those millennia writers
From the county of the gods in the land of messiahs
Path of the thirty-three stars in the hands of Osiris
Babylonian talmudic setting
Speaking the Shekhinah in God's wedding
The messiah has a palace in the highest heavens
In a celestial temple mirrors the image of a earthly presence
Sit in mystic Hasidic circles
With God virtue
No curfew
Bars will unearth schools
For a hundred thousand years one king ruled
Then read the Talmud then Midrash
The pyramid vast
Beneath the universe
The moon will burst into gas
Rabbi ben holds a zohar
That speaks of the old gods
That walks in space becomes solar
God studies the Torah
Then split the night
Dividing the upper and the lower waters
Thus creating order
Then breathing deep
Into the subconscience sleep transporters
Unfinished creation
Creation of the angels
The first twelve hours of Adam's life
The nine heavens empowers the body of light
Spaceship planet

VERSE II
When I open the Tanakh I'm a astronaut
A Sefirot on a astral circle
Damoo to the gods unlock
They submerge the tablets
Broke 'em up into fragments

Spoke in mathematics
Put them up in the attics
The earth becomes a star
The birth of a god
Bloodline of the divine
Outpost on Mars
A tribe of vampire indians
Speak to the snake queens
On the star Sirius
Egyptian Hyksos
Appeared in a burst of smoke
The epic of paradise
Turn Israelite from Thoth
Look at king Leonard William
And what he put in the British Museum
Astronomic seasons
The Gnomon tablets
Bone extractions
Details of shadow-length and water clock data
Earth intercalary practice and equators
Become one with nature
The sun is savior
Mars is a hundred and forty-two million miles
Away from the sun
Worlds in the past and worlds to come
Mercury distance born born
Venus distance born culture and freedom
Before Eden was formed
Earth born understanding
The third planet
Moses was given the commandments
And Daniel knew the patterns of Saturn
After the garden Adam was handed
Sound travels one thousand one hundred twenty
Feet per second
Shi'ur Qomah
