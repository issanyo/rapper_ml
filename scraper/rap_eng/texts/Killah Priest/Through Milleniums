[Verse 1]
As the Sun fades within the horizon
In the sky Orion is seen clear in this sphere—planets alligning
The contrast changes fast in the vast from a pink to a dark orange
It's turning darker to a bluish violet
The finally the sky lit up with stars, the red one is Mars
The same star seen by the Three Wise Men
Define the child—lead us out of this blindness
And teach man peace—finally it's kindness
Darkness brings the cold, so that change the climate
Stare at my wall, look at the thermometer
The red line slowly declining
Finally the sky's black is a raven's wings
That slowly flap down upon the Earth
The place where fiends are doing base
Sirens are heard from police cars...
