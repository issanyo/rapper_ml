[Intro: 60 Second Assassin]
I ain't want nothing known but a bank roll
On the other side of 123rd St., bro'
Nothing known but a bank roll
On the other side of 123rd St., bro'
Bringing it straight off the curb
Now this shit is tough
I got this shit magic from here to Texas trap
With the Guard U's stash
I ain't want nothing known but a bank roll
On the other side of 123rd, bro'
Yo, that's that
I ain't want nothing known but a bank roll

[Break: Prodigal Sunn]
Life is reality, reality is life
People living trife, the world filled with strife
The gods living, writing exact, too many blacks
Black on black crime, no vest, another victim laid to rest
Life is reality, reality is life
Niggas living trife, bitches living sheisty
The gods living, writing exact
Too many blacks, black on black crime
No vest, another victim laid to rest
Life is reality, reality
Life is reality, reality
Life is reality, reality is life
Niggas living trife, bitches living sheist
The gods living, writing exact
Too many blacks, black on black crime
No vest, another victim laid to rest
Life is reality, reality, life is reality
Life is reality, reality

[Prodigal Sunn]
I break bread, eliminate feds and dead heads
I seen the bloodshed, devils decay, torture, enslave
From Red Hook to Compton, Fort Green to Albany
Galleries of artillery, a symphony, military
Some adversaries and fairies caught the bad decision
Physical collision, we leave 'em holy like some Christians

[60 Second Assassin]
A new incorporation, your rap exoriantation
Not a reorientation, or interntation
More and more foes is what I'm chasing
Low down international business, players exchanging
Your ears pound, throw down erasing

[Prodigal Sunn]
Maneuvering, moving like slugs from a silencer
My fleet of seven on your calender, fuck an amateur

[60 Second Assassin]
Game premeditated, crime related, crime anticipated
Chess, some hardest gamers, the world black as entertainment

[Prodigal Sunn]
Your time is short, change your thought, rearrange your sports
Stop being pork on a fork, I get scorched by the torch
In this Sunz of Man federation, pure meditation
Righteous advigation for the blind in my nation

[60 Second Assassin]
That still remaining through all the shot reigning
Hit grim, stitchy grain, playing half, broke that untouchable
Still tapping plants, by the forced in, rap street, yo extortion

[Chorus: Prodigal Sunn]
Life is reality, reality is life
People living trife, the world filled with strife
The gods living, writing exact, too many blacks
Black on black crime, no vest, another victim laid to rest
Life is reality, reality is life, reality

[Killah Priest]
In the beast like orcra, swim across the border
Walk upon the water, holding the minora
Reaching for the Torah, face full of torture
One deeper than my ora, I stalk ya with the offer
Law and order, cut your day shorter
Slaughter everybody in the party

[Hell Razah]
Check the godly, from prenatal to the graves
We hell raise you, break your bread at the table
With my real Kane and Ables it gets fable
We build stables, we drop jewels that enslave you

[Killah Priest]
Wear the wooden bander, seven shield commander
Wave the golden banner, swinging down the hammer
In the house of David, we gold, true laces
Diamond bracelets, niggas on that snake ship

[Hell Razah]
There ain't no love without the hatred
The cure for the snakes in the snake pits
Created and those that's belated
It's too deep, you fear, must prepare scuba-gear
Got a ocean of the dry potion, we mind smoking
I'm blind for the thugs and drug dealers
Who used to be pyramid builders, ancient healers
Stand for mirrors, all they see is cap pealers and reflection
Moon do me right, give me night life, the shine in all directions

[Killah Priest]
Worldly impressions, natural infections, massive depression
Dealing with reality, fantasies is nothing but a fantasy
I see it's all vanity, humanities, who volcanically
Satanically, on the edge of my sanity, can't we be all family

[Outro: Killah Priest]
Simple, keep it all in the mental
It's so simple
Never cash your jewels amongst mine
Only through the struggle
In your mind
Going through the struggle
We gotta form a huddle
Ain't no sunshine when we gone
After darkness takes day
Ain't no shine when he gone
We build to make knowledge born
Anytime, for darkness today
I want everybody to realize
From darkness to day
