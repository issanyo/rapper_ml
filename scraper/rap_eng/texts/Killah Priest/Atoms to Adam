[Hook: Shanghai the Messenger]
Ohh ma, ma, ma, ma, wow, wow
I see chariots in the skies
Men and Earth looked surprised as they flow across the sky
And I see the light deep into the night
Up there on Mars among the stars in that distant land
Swift as light, we took our flight, the chosen people
Ohh ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, Lord, Lord
The reasons why we here
Ohh ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, woah, woah
The reasons why we here

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Before being born without physical form, a void in the vast
My space voyage begins between the asteroid
Before I landed upon the planet, it looked abandoned
Lost and stranded
I became a force that demanded life laws took flight
One course of the night, searched for any source of life
Light was the know the ledge coming from the edge of the Universe
When past the Moon to the Earth, then from the womb to the nurse
With a slight remembrance how I came from a distance
To an instant existence with 5 senses
The quest for man repentance
While others cried, I exercised my third eye by hearing a lullaby
Then I magnified inside and became intelligent and wise
Transformed from the celestial
Shot through a sexual terrestrial's testicle vessel
Small as a decimal where I nestle
Nine months later, special delivery, the Killah P-R-I-E-S-T
From the fetus to the cleavage, from atoms to Adams
From atoms to Adams, from atoms to Adams

[Hook: Shanghai the Messenger]
I see chariots in the skies
Men and Earth look surprised as they flow across the sky
And they see the light deep between the night
Up there on Mars among the stars in that distant land

[Killah Priest]
So I begin between the meteorite, now I walk like Christ
Except I'm not sacrificed by the righteous parasite
Searching for paradise which is the birthright
Of a celestial Nazarite with appetites to bite from the Tree of Life
To smite Edomites, Sodomite, Moabites in the land of Canaanites
Following 6 flaming lights burning over 1 million degrees Fahrenheit
Bright as neon beyond the satellites
The flight takes me over cattle stocks
Blocks of ice, I began to flock, flock, flocked
Flocked across Mecca with a vivid projector
Seeking my accepter, looking at Rebecca
Two sons bopping through Jerusalem like the hoodlum, aahh
Principalities enables me to see the other galaxies
Releasing all calories by 8 author biters and allergies
I'm the author and the writer of a biography with God prophecies and challenge Egyptology philosophies and Greek mythologies
Going through the glossaries of Socrates
With Pharisees and Sadducees
Going through geology with degrees I contact the Hasmonean dynasty
Approximately 168 BC
Transform from the Wu Killa Bee into the families of the Maccabee
I can see every species in 3D and hear them clear as CDs
During my pilgrimage, I walked through the wilderness
I had the privilege to see the pyramids
Which gave me the will to live
To roam through the villages and heal the kids
Walk across a bridge strong as Farrakhan
As a voice echo like Sarah Vaughan across the great Amazon
Stretching out my hand like Yon till it reach Babylon
Behold the physic phenomenon, quiet storm
I wander out on horizon from the top of holy mount Zion
Holding a staff and turned into a python
Killah Priest a living icon
Sitting in the form of a pentagon in the center of the octagon
Walking from Tyre to Sidon to Lebanon to the walls of Hong Kong
Recite the 23rd Psalm, long gone before the crack of dawn
Dodging and weaving through the Garden of Eden without eating
Speeding, throbbing, lobbing, evolving all the regions

[Break: Shangai the Messanger]
As they flow across the sky

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Those that were uncivilized was chastised
While the civilized were baptised
Twelve Tribes began to rise like bees from the hive
Causing seeds with their wives
Starting apartheid as scribes carried the archives
Follow the star guide as we glide through the windows of the far side
Across the dark sky, then over the ocean tides
The unidentified flying object hovers the projects
Scenery, Gothic sky can pass for darkness
As the thugs transform into prophets, the body becomes cosmic
As the floor becomes carpet they rise from out the toxic
And the wasteland and the garbage
Where faces of various shades of chocolate
Dropping their narcotics and the pork sausage
No longer Hell's hostage

From atoms to Adams..

(as they flow across the sky..)

From atoms to Adams..

(as they flow across the sky..)

From atoms to Adams..

(ever see the light, deep into the night
Of daily mars among the stars
In that distant land...)
