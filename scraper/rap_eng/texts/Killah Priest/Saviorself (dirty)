[Vinnie Paz]
Yeah, I built with Alexander the Great
He told the Persians they should stay gone
Then he told me about the Oracle of Amon
He gave me no clue where it is
Men feared time, yet time fear the pyramids
He gave me more jewels, he told me that
Amenhotep was immortal, I can't overstand hieroglyph
So I called Killah Priest, and he taught me how to follow it
I walked through the Valley of the Kings
With a white robe, white rose and what I will brings
And your whole team Judas, my road thin, gold skin like Zeus's
I speak the dialog of the dead, I practiced the same war tactics
In King Arthur's head, so let the swordsmen kill the beast
It's a Legacy of Blood, with Vinnie Paz and Killah Priest

[Killah Priest]
I paint flows with the feathers from the wings of angels
Red ink from saint blood, nigga, you ain't thug
Stare into the face of a king's mug
Crush grape, feel the wine jug, ill thoughts
Build from the mind of rhyme, rolls off the tongue like fine rugs
Let me walk you through this, for the clueless
I'm Shakespeare'ing, with grey earrings
Speak like Tiberius, write novels
Spit it like Aristotle, face half Pharoah
And half owl, I took the path of Cairo
Came back with the Dead Sea Gospel
Now im known as the Dead Street Apostle
See dem feds, shoot them hollows
Bullets spread, til they meet Diablo
Stars in alignment, Priest meet with Jedi Mind Tricks
Reach them climates, where you can't breathe
Stay high off that dead weed, in the mind is where I plant seeds
To grow fruit, of kings so brute, of army troops
Mighty men in celestial suits
You need healing, my mic give you incredible boost
Where I use satellite vision, stare at my alphabetical soup
Plus I use the Big Dipper to take, more than one scoop, it's Priesthood

[Chorus: Stouple cuts up samples]

So if you can't be trusted, may you return where the dust is" -

Burn him as a sacrifice"

[Vinnie Paz]
I studied element 1-15, with the Elohim
Saw the Canaanites, Sumerians, and the Philistines
This is street gospel, if you don't believe
In life on Mars, that mean the beast got you
You don't wanna see me and Killah Priest hostile
You don't wanna see, desert eag' heat pop you
This is Mothman Prophecy, walk back
To the sand of Iraq, and let the prophet breath
We turned all our water into toxic seas
And walk on water with armor that I copped in Greece
Then I shot the beast with a long arrow
Studied Imhotep to be a strong Pharoah
It's a war when the Gods spit
It's Allah, when I split the icebergs, in the Arctic
I don't care what the cause is
And I'mma ride for my fam, no matter what the cost is

[Outro: Vinnie Paz *Stoupe cuts samples to end*]
Yeah, Vinnie Paz, Killah Priest, yea
