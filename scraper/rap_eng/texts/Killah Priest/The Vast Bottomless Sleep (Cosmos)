[Verse 1]
My writing's like sci fi, population of the earth spread wide
Till it inhabited the twelfth planet on the sky
But back down on the land
To kill the Pope and the leaders of the alien tribe
The son of man must find the reptilian hive
Where they hide, the six human beast inside
With six fangs as teeth, six pairs of eyes
Beware of his pride blasphemy is his bride
Wearer of the dragon crown
Sitting in the spirit wagon with flaming bulls pulling him around

[Verse 2]
I'm from where volcanic ash blotted out the sun
Till the earth begin to freeze
I'm a prisoner from the lost universe
Behold the prophetic MC, they captured beautiful women
Began the mutating 'til they never stop aging
Scientist capture beautiful women
Start the mutating til they never stop aging
But I'm such a prolific writer
What happens if the lady is a martial arts fighter
And mutated to half a tiger and half fire
I'm the wizard from the white Phoenix city
Where Elohims come out crystal frisbees
From the super rap committee
From the future back centuries
Indy lift up veils to unseen worlds
King of tales dark the art has spells
Hundreds of infants with wings
Grey smoke surround my body like ghost
The darkest words I ever wrote
I spit words into a sea
My quotes flow as quick as my eternal spirit

[Verse 3]
Define the most high beginning
Multiply the living poltergeist in my writtens
Approach solar lights high yellow
Burnt orange and crimson
Dimensions depth width lengths
Gaining strength
Take a glimpse read the glyphs
In the valley of the dark side of the Moon
Through an alley of art lies a tomb
