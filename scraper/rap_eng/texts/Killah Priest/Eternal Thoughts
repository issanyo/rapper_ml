(Intro)
What happened here officer?
Detectives have seen a dead body on the floor
I got this
Stand back, stand back
Stand back, stand back
There was a man there... there was a man there
-
[Killah Priest]
A young man solves a murder case by touching the bodies of victims
Put his hair to the dead mouths to listen
A woman wakes up in a bed screaming cuz her ovaries are missing
She's paralyzed, then the warm lights glisten
A man lifts up a truck to save his son
Another visits his son in the grave over a gun
A family attends the graduation; the other family visits a prison
Caught up in the system, or you rise to prism
Childbirth to ploughing dirt
From a smile to a smirk to a frown, now we hurt
Everything in the ground of the Earth
To billions of planets and elements found in the Universe
The question - the answer - the problem - the solver
The puzzle - the single - the couples
Life and death to life after death
To resurrect this mic I adjust
The sermon - the prayer - the ritual
We all prepare -
The Church - the Mosque - the Temple to the school
The mystery is the future, it's the history
The failure to his victory
