[Intro: Priest talking]
Uh, looking inside my book
Uh, one time, uh 4th Disciple
Uh KP, dimes, uh, in the looking glass
Live for everything, when I open up my book
None for nutting knaw'mean?
Seeing the looking glass

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Life and Death is like a carnival in cemeteries
Ain't nobody left that's honorable they all been buried
The Chronicles, from Muhammad schools to Gods name vary
Black people are the promised Jew's cause we lost already
My cross is heavy, I carry it - this is my burden
Look in the sky! See chariots, why the Earth is just burning
The worst is determined by the birth of a person. I'm also hurting
Soul searching, I go to the sermons of elder Gerry Burns
Life as a failure, my worries return
I know cats who could of went pro
Wasn't born with a silver spoon to his mouth
But put a silver spoon to his nose
He was nice in football but every time the hood call he would go
The projects is like the insane asylum, full of gangs and violence
Pain and problems, heavy rain I hear violins
At funerals, it's the usual - explain this knowledge

[Chorus: Allah Sun]
Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass

Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
The pastor preaches, wives and widows open their purses
Throwing dollars hoping one day they meet Jehovah in person (The Lord)
Miracles; a man who can't walk leaps out of his chair
Saw the same man a week before walk up his stairs
An old lady who can't hear, she just stares
Showing no facial expression
She's a victim of racial oppression
Her grandkids she pray Angels protect 'em
A knock at the door - it's agents and detectives!
"Your kid's been hit by a stray" (Oh Lord!)
Another dollar got to find a better way
Another day, another lesson, life stressing
Dice games, liquor stores and pool halls
Money on the table, spot that Q-ball (Rack 'em up)
Winner takes all, now rack 'em
The nine ball symbolizes the planets
The last ones to get the black one
To get 'em you have to crack 'em
Listen to this "innerstanding"
Absorb is more than just gambling

[Chorus: Allah Sun]
Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass

Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
Remember W.D. Fard Muhammad
The prophet that gave Elijah his knowledge
Elijah gave it to Malcolm
But on their way to the promise they ran into problems
And only through death they resolved
From the Mosque to the school up in Harlem
'Cause Clarence X left, started his own set
Gave a new breath of fresh air to the projects
With the Supreme Arithmetics
Young teens got hip to the devils tricks
But in '69 the God got hit
But you can still hear him when Poppa Wu parts his lips
And there was Dr. Malachi Z. York with deep thought
Called himself "The Lamb," "The Nuwaubian," "Godly Man"
Built his own Egypt on the top of the sand
Then there's Yahweh Ben Yahweh, called down UFOs
All these men the U.S. knows
It's like our mind deteriorated when drugs came in
And it took us back to the cavemen

[Chorus: Allah Sun]
Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass

Every time I look and close my eyes
My mind I can see the end of time
Looking at the world - it's so divine
While I'm staring through my looking glass

[outro: Killah Priest]
Uh-huh, world wide G-Sciples
Yo Rest in Peace
To Allah Sun on the hook baby
He was never buried he was only planted
'Cause we're gonna grow from this
