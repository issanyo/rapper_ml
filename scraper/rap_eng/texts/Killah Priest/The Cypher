*The cypher, yeah you know the deal*

[Verse 1: Aspects]
Yo the matches and gases right next to the burner
If it ain't about cash, then it's all about murder
Pyrex empires, who's next to die? (who's next?)
Never leaving witnesses, nobody testify
Now I'm hard like Escobar, the fuzz keep coming
We keep pushing hard, 100 Miles And Running
There's more coke than there's ever been, (ever!) yeah it's evident
The key to not getting caught is never leaving evidence
Stealth mode fighter jets, making sure my life is set
I don't really fuck with you unless you fucking writing checks
And speaking universal language of getting CREAM
All about my dolla, dolla bills, you know what I mean?, I'm eating
Break me off a piece of the cake
If not, I'll have to take the piece right off of your plate
I got a large appetite for this money in life
And I'm making moves across the border like they moving the white (move!)

[Hook]
The cypher, yeah you know the deal
This is our secret garden
Shit ain't real unless it's real in the cypher
Representation
Rapper after rapper
Rhyme after rhyme
Who's next?
Tony Starks
Bring it on, so bring it on

[Verse 2: Ghostface Killah]
Mask and gloves, with the bulldog snub
The liquid drano with acid is next to the tub
Crack spots, my texture of bass fluctuates
Politician that spend Gs [?]
Lord, the gate's open, with mountains and slopes and
The Columbian perico leave rocked up it's potent
With Jiggy on the payroll, Santa Claus bags of coke
That's so heavy that his motherfucking sleigh broke
The Paris kingpin is far from extinction
The days of Tony Montana is back with a sequence
For many reasons, never seeing the precinct
Y'all could just call me obese cause I'm eating

[Hook]
Yeah, you know the deal
In the cypher shit is true
Shit ain't real unless it's real in the cypher
Representation
Fuck where you're from, it's time to shoot your lyrics kid
Who's next?
Swisha T
Bring it on, so bring it on

[Verse 3: Swisha T]
This is the time for my essence, don't try to mess with it
I'm on the track with Killah Priest, this is my final testament
I'm on my way to excellence
They feel my power and presence like I invented this
Leaving these MCs trembling
Nothing's above me, I slang fifty Ps of that fluffy
Sticky icky and that Philly, turn college kids into flunkies
I'm embarking on my future of living lavish and glorious
I kick a rapper's flow, get it popping like pandemonium
I need to wrap the story up
I got a call from my homie saying he's rolling with Ghostly
I'm faded, but I'm blazing up, paper making Arabian
Amazing how I play with my verbals, I need a stadium
To show these motherfuckers they're sleeping on something epic, and
What you talking? You rappers need to just get on my level and
Take a pen, just be original, cause we're well aware
That everything you write is just fictional like a fairytale (Swisha)

[Hook]
The cypher, yeah you know the deal
Shit ain't real unless it's real in the cypher

Rapper after rapper, rhyme after rhyme
Who's next?
Killah Priest
Bring it on, so bring it on

[Verse 4: Killah Priest]
Peace to the seeds and the air that we breathe
The dirt from the trees, the birds and the bees, the herb from the leaves
My interest for insects was vintage
Salute to the animals, digest the lamb and wolf
Understandable, beautiful land in full
Tribute to the sun, you the only one
The golden drum, nothing exists 'till you are hung
Before brain, hearts and the lung
Before his reign, the golden heart was sprung in heaven
Credence of life, the sky seasoned with light
Shalom to the moon, you a beautiful bright
We all see you before the tomb, magnificent
We breathe in the womb, water, the aura
Before the coroner saw us, The Torah
Modern technology that history taught us (uh)

[Hook]
The cypher, yeah you know the deal
Yeah, you know the deal
The cypher, yeah you know the deal
Yeah, you know the deal
In the cypher, shit is true
This is our secret garden
Shit ain't real unless it's real in the cypher
