[Interlude: Killah Priest]
Yo one day this kid told me a story. He said a man approached him and asked him, "When you grow up, what you wanna be?" The kid said nothing he just stared. The old man said, "What's the matter son, why you so quiet? Why are you just sitting there". The kid simply he said, "I'm tryna listen to the Universe of what destiny was shaping him to be. It's not about what we want, it's about who we are". You know, that's how life is. That kid {?} was W.R. And I'ma just leave it at that. That's how life is, man
