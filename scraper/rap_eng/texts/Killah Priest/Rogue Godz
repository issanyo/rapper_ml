VERSE I
Pilot dragons sailing through the eyes of monsters
Conquer island of the scientist
Iron ship flying disk
Landed on the shores of the moors
Men of war swinging swords
Battle axe pharaoh hats
Shadows trap the light of the day
As we pray
Approaches the end
The vultures ascend
The coldest of winds
Blows over men
Poet transcends
The holder of pens
Soldiers begin to shoot
At the birth of Zeus
From God's roof
Then disappear like poof
Gog and Magog
Rogue gods
Torpedo cigars
The baldheaded villain
Rubbing the emerald skull
His words were chilling
From the land of Null
Tell the account
Send the amount
For the count
On Mount Yugoslavia
Removed the bodies of Dr Smith and his sexy sidekick
The bitch was high risk
Right then bullets flew through the iris of his Isis
He grab the nurse that gave him his dialysis
They both fall into his gold obelisk
Beneath an iced out sign that read
"Annuit coeptis novus ordo seclorum"
Bleeding, one bullet caught him right between his ???
His native tongue he began talking
Zat Yat art grabbed his heart
His eyes rolled back, he said ------ lie
Close his eyes, then he died
His demise
Tomb raiders
Ziggurat builders

VERSE II
Space pirates, skeleton kings
Snake empire seraphim wings
Star Osiris reptilian queens
Eggs of vipers build the machine
Ghost ships on the rivers of blood
Float silent through the cliff killers above
The evidence fits between the murder and glove
Prosecute justice and handcuff love
By then the dragon will win
The world's beauty pageant
And take home awards to every movie imaginable
Also the winner of fashion
Become the biggest star
Right before declares himself a god
Speak in an unholy accent
And grab access to everything that's blasphemous
Wear the head of a Baphomet
With the 7 on his chest like Kapernick
But his team will block out the sun
As he leaves the people as savages for the Nazareth
