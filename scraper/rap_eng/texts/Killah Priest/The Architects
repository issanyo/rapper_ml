[Canibus]
Stars come to life like UFOs moving in the night
I memorize the movements of the lights
Stingray sharp barbed darts launch from the heart
Of the Sephiroth sloth that can make you bleed thoughts
So be advised, my rhymes override the mind
But you'll be fine after average recovery time
I'm heavyweight slim face, I breath when the wind breaks
Breast plates move when I give chase
Jumped the boundary like Space Jam, wait 'til I get up in your base camp
You gonna have to face the champ
Roman shield is composed of a rose coloured stone
My sword is honed from Red Dragon's rib bones
The bow is quietly cocked, watch, I'm a take the shot
If the target ever stands in one spot
