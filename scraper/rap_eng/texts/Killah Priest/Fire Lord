[Verse: Killah Priest]
He stood beside the gate and twist his back, arch holding a stick
Beneath a cliff, his back hard
His face and eyes seem molded and fixed on the beyond
Unknowing, unspoken
He reaches his arms, then turned over to his palms
And said, "Inside is the writing of the Holy Scribes"
His eyes shut but then slowly rised
He gave off ghostly vibes
Smile his gold teeth shined
"Ah yes, would you like me to explain what's on the walls"
Such a frail frame, his hand shaking as he pointed
"This way, follow me
It's right outside a hollow tree where owls be
Near fountain peak right below powerless creak
Our rates are hourly
Mister, I didn't get your name
He turned around into a big ball of flames
The walls and the halls of the kings
Standing in awe at a god
