[Verse 1]
The great rebellion say hailing Van Halen
Inhaling continents make me fatal to angels' halos
Grave clothes, eight crows peck death
Switch minds up, drink blood from a cup
Wizards and witch fables
Keep out of the reach of children, poison seeps through buildings
The psychic and the healing, the tarot deck
The pharaoh's death, the apple [?]
The maid paid one million for her crew dealings
This product can be ignited under certain circumstances
The virgin of a candle standing
Shake, and turn the can upside down
His spray, priest is on his way
From down syndrome to grabbing the crown to infinitive thrones
The clowns ascended from stones
Remove the small cap, from the spray nozzle and write "Priest"
The praised apostle, running clockwords outside a circle nine times
Sit down, Indian style, to sip black wine
All competition is given death
From her words: "All praise Elizabeth"

[Verse 2]
Crack unsaturated fat, this is King David's sedated rap
Praise and save your amen, I'm misbehaving on tracks
Arms of heron with elephant palms
The medicine strong I'm on
An death to all, cholesterol flow
Vegetable oil, mixed with hydro
He's wheezing, [?] needed, losing ounces from bleeding
Tube feeding, blood oozing from all regions
Of the body, harmful when swallowed
Palm full of hollows, songs of apostles
What's important, give it to you in portions
Call it caution, read directions if affected
Call 1-800-something, the operator answer blooded
I'm from the dungeons, who can fuck around, nigga?

[Sample]
The immortals...

Ora e sempre
Today and forever
For and ages to come
'Till the last trumpet sounds!

Her majesty, the queen of the water spirits
(Immortality...)
