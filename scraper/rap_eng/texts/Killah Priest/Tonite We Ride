Verse I
My peeps creep up in black jeeps
Black motorcycles, Harley Davids jackets
Tattered dragons, Skull disciples
The one eye of the great seal on our shoulders
Street soldiers. Heat holders
Any tension will make you lean over
Niggers hate flinching and sudden movements
We get to shootin’
Gangster music
Killers with pool sticks, so much cake
We drive around in the cool whip
My mind state is William Crowdy
Killers around me. My vision gets cloudy
Now we on thrones, wizard douse me
Chosen water
Stone pillars, porcelain alters
Come talk to Walter
Fine women all draped in line
All my niggas got crowns on ‘em
This y’all warning, my destiny is calling

(Hook)
Come. tonight we ride, pray we don’t die
Tonight we fly. Ride, fly, pray we don’t die
Verse II
They call me the great terrible king
My back leans. My hands joined with the palms of my queen
Vision fades. we still on the block AKs and crack
The usual daps and holla backs
This brick and martyr rap . . 
I bring flowers for you cats
It’s funeral day
For you and your corny DJ, now replay
I’m up in Amsterdam coffee shops puffing hash
You at the club in the circle spankin’ your own ass
This is stained glass, chrome blast. Now, walk the angels’ path
I laugh and dump my ash. Another toe tag, body bag
You pussy-clot
Trying to test the God
The rest of y’all wear panties and bras
I see a little fanny from your squad
No homo that’s for me and Biggie
He’s gone, now I run the city no P. Diddy
No making of the band
Just me breaking your hand
Crushing like soda cans
Conan, throwin’ lightning bolts at your fam
My fifth shoots fireballs
Why you all tryin’ to front
You know we fry you all up at once

(Hook)
Come. tonight we ride, pray we don’t die
Tonight we fly. Ride, fly, pray we don’t die
Fly, fly, pray we don’t die
(Closing by George Clinton)
Blow us up, they have set to blow us up
Blow us up, with no regret they blow us up
Blow us up, you want to bet they blow us up
Ask ‘em what we did and when we did it
They say glorify, lock us up
They attempt to lock us up
Lock us up, with no regret they lock us up
You want to bet they lock us up
Ask ‘em what we did and when we did it
