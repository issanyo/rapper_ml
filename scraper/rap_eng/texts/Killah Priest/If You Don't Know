[Intro: Killah Priest]
Killah Priest... King Masada
Landed on a sick canvas
Now I roam this dead planet, head bandaged
Insane, preachin God's commandment, feel me

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
I move through the dark regions, and won't stop
'til we even, until you bleedin, until you stop breathin
Givin careers a severe beatin for emceeing
It's something that I don't take lightly
How the fuck you ever invite me to a duel?
I drool before I break fool, then I drag MC's
Beat em down to they knees, grab your necks and squeeze
Till there's no life left, they lifeless
Then micless, what a crisis
I give them a good night's rest
I break they biceps, and triceps, thighs and necks
Breast area is the best area
Before I bury ya, I make sure that you never ever, ever, ever try that shit no more
KnowhatI'msayin? (Word is bond!)
Your ambition put you in that fucked up condition
Leave you with your own conviction, shit was not fiction
Now you in a state of non-fiction
Make you beg for mercy if you ever approach me
I blow your head off when I talk, chop off your arms
And bash your head in, you know where this shit is headin
For a dead-end, stop your sweatin
Like Otis Reading, got your pants wettin
Snuck up on you at your wedding, at your honeymoon
Turn that shit into doom
Turn your rap cassettes into your fucking caskets
You God damn bastards
Lyrics I mastered, rhymes burns like acid

[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
I'm complete analyzer of your entire eye
Gave you no time to crawl, so walk on by
I'm the insect in your pie, the hair to your lie
The good to your bye; your question to your why?
The wing to your fly, low to your high
The Dirt Dog, I be the God; the tear to your cry
I drop in it, cleanse the Earth's
My place to birth strong, gave me the eye

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
The fatal brave to grave, the ceremonies from religious cults half man and half goat
Tomorrow hopes, based on the horoscopes
We followed goats, our nose and hella smoke
Fire breathin dragons, I rubbed the gold lantern
To the see the future through the crystal ball
The triple walls of fisher wants to miss the fall
Offense see the coffin often
I fell at the doorstop coughin, I heard the pipe organ (cough)
Saw some men of a white origin
I saw Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan and George Bush
Barefoot, sucking from the titties of a wolf
Upon the brazen altar
Six men offer their only daughter splashing holy water
I ran for the, camcorders, now I'm plagued with curses
I roam the Earth's surface, snatchin purses
Allergic to catholic churches, what's the purpose
Religious worship, is worthless
I visit ancient sanctuaries, where the saints were married
But now they buried cause of Satan's fury, I faced the jury
Held in court like Christ nailed to a cross
Confront my knowledge like Christ in front of Pontius Pilate
Days of violent, standing in a haunted palace
The government wants my wallet

[Chorus: Ol' Dirty Bastard] (x2)
I'm complete analyzer of your entire eye
Gave you no time to crawl, so walk on by
I'm the insect in your pie, the hair to your lie
The good to your bye; your question to your why?
The wing to your fly, low to your high
The Dirt Dog, I be the God; the tear to your cry
I drop in it, cleanse the Earth's
My place to birth strong, gave me the eye

[Outro: Killah Priest]
If you don't know... now you know
Killah Priest, now you know
