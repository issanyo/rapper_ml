Oh so you a killer now?
What part of the game is that?
O so you a thug?
What part of the game is that?
So you sold mad drugs?
O so yall gangstaz now?
What part of the game is that?

[Killah Priest]
First of all everybody can't mc
Second of all, y'all all sound wack to me
Third y'all sound like a group of wannabes
Either it's 2Pac or another B.I.G
Here's the truth for ya rappers, be ya self
But y'all scared to do that, cuz won't see no wealth
Matter of fact when y'all leave the ring leave those belts
I ain't gonna stop till every word is felt
Most of yall cats never bust no gats
And most of yall cats neva sold no crack
And most of yall cats better thank god for rap
Cause most of y'all left the hood and can't come back
Believe that, niggas ain't trying to see no plaques
Specially if your pockets are fat and theirs is flat
Niggas like an applause, ever heard of gun clap
Ever heard that click clack, rat tat tat tat
Damn money what part of the game is that?

So yall gangstaz now?
What part of the game is that?
O so now y'all thugs?
What part of the game is that?
O you sold mad drugs?
What part of the game is that?
O so you killers now?
What part of the game is that?
O you gangstaz?
What part of the game is that?
You gotta be somethin
What part of the game is that?
O you a hustler?
What part of the game is that?

See a lot of y'all cats never been upstate
So why ya getting mad and all bent out of shape
Gangsta rap? Come on yall was on roller skates
And now ya trying to blow up on the next mans mistake
I've been broke to long to let a nigga rob me
Be up in ya lobby, at least 5 deep
Creep in ya crib and pop 5 in ya sheet
Pop another one nigga trying to rob me
We ride in these streets, survive in these streets
Niggas get high, niggas die in the streets
Fuck that, I roll up on the side of ya jeep
In the range asking for change, hidin my heat
Get smart, I let one fly through ya seat
Through ya heart, leave a nigga lyin beneath
2000 who wanna side with the Priest
And I'm lounging all my niggas playin for keeps

Chorus:

Oh so you Biggie now?
What part of the game is that?
Nah you think you Pac?
What part of the game is that?
Oh you a warlord now?
What part of the game is that?
Hey yo Ras tell em
What part of the game is that?

[Ras Kass]
I'm live evil, I know live people
Anxious to bang ya wit heavy metal like Magneto
Now who really on some gangsta shit?
Not every nigga with a stomach tattoo, bandana and a click homey
You ain't dope just cuz ya sniff it, or lace ya blunt with it
That just makes ya a wack rapper and a drug addict, get it
These niggas rhyme like they AK spray shit
Sell a ki of yay shit, gotta ride, homicide, every single gay shit
Get smacked in the streets by some real nigga who don't play shit
Hit the pavement screaming it's just entertainment
And that ain't it, life sucks like fumigation
My obligation, expose all ya funny bunnies
Rappers actin slash fudge packin for the money
Cuz next week if the new fad was hip hop fags
You'll find a lot of these thug niggas in drag, believe that

Oh so you a thug?
What part of the game is that?
Nah you a gangsta
What part of the game is that?
Oh now you a killa
What part of the game is that?
Oh now you a warlord
What part of the game is that?
I can't get no money?
What part of the game is that?
