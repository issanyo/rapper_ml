[Verse 1]
Dive into my offering like a dophin
Swim through tracks, look out for lost gems
Spit proverbs, take heed to our warning
From my intro to where a child is talking, that's my clue
Y'all do the rest, I can only give you portions
It's too deep, Heavy Mental Part 2
God blew breath into my skeleton
My lungs start working, I inhaled the wind
Skies cracked, it started raining myrrh
Then I was cured
Then I was lured to the alter to give y'all The Offering
These album verses are written out so I can't do fuck ups
Like they did on Atoms to Adam
All I hear in my head is "Priest, get at him, get at him"
First let me slay the dragon, then I'll spray the magnum

[Outro]
I'm glad that I could do this, you know what I mean?
I kill a blindfolded lady
Fuck that bitch
America I'm coming for you
Country I'm coming for you
The secrets going to be revealed
Just wait 'til the album is here
The clue is, the child that speaks in the beginning - that's the intro
