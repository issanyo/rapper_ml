[Intro]
Yeah, it's Priest
It's that carbon light flow
UFO

[Verse 1: Killah Priest & Auto-tuned Killah Priest]
Uh
I'll take your brain around the universe
Like how Uber works
Grab some peppermints
And here's some bottle of water if you in thirst
Now computer search
I dial-up the location, destination, is through this verse
The pen I write with is nuclear
When I sit on my throne all I do is smirk
Easy
I used to catch the train on Kingston to utica
Easy
Came disguised as a jeweler from Jupiter
Pull out your heart to [?]the carbon like my in the hood
Easy
Holy rhymes that intimidate, Lucifer
Show me any god or king I'm not ruler of
Pull out your heart to [?] in the hood
On my way to Jerusalem
Whats running through my vein is the super blood
Easy
Yes, I'm Harry Potter of the Chakras
Wait, I'm Harry Potter of Cabalas
My mics magic it entertains toddlers
The unexplained is conjured when i sit with dalai lamas
And deep rastas, puffin marijuana
Moon crickets, pyramid Cabaka
The tombs lifted Lord Fury spit the lava
Killah Priest between pillars my mystique is like a jaguar
Easy
So my condolence to my opponents, for atonement
Easy
Took you apart, put you together like components
You break my bridal to me, losing control
My bars a scripture, trap listeners
Become prisoners of the moment
Government clonin, diss yall till yall faced like christ and the romans

Kill devils, execute satan, persecute romans
Wind blowin,  [?] , musical rhythms
Funeral admission, visions, savage rain, [?]
Flood waters, blood offers, flyin saucer , no warnin
