[Chorus x1.5: Killah Priest]
My life, though things may seem hard
My life, I know I can depend on God
My life, things might not always go right
My life, but at the end I'll see a bright light

[Killah Priest]
So many types of women, a life that I was livin'
The clubs, the thugs, the nights that I would give in
It didn't feel right in my system but I was with 'em
Trying to fight the feeling but I was just like a victim
Caught up in the rhythm of dough I was spendin'
Drinking down venom, the bacardi and lemon
The bartender grinnin', the party's just beginning
And I was sent into it, it was probably endin'
I mean the stars, the cars, the cards that you charge
To the brauds that you meet at the bar, it's all a mirage
I even ignored my true calling from God
Hid like Jonah in the club with bottles of corona
Surrounded by models and owners, and cronic smokers
The ones that you find in a coma, play the corners
Gun holder sprayed the foreigners
But today I'm no longer, much stronger
Witness my song, cuz

[Chorus x2: Killah Priest (singer)]
My life, money, girls and material things
In my life, it means alot to a player when he's chasing his dream
My life, it takes alot to turn a player around
My life, especially in the playa moment when he lays on the ground
(In my life)

[Killah Priest]
Taking straight shots of liquor, leave a spot on my liver
Bustin' shots at my niggas praying cops come quicker
Cuz the life I got, somethin' not to live for
My kid's 4' 5", and 12, surviving hell
My nigga Boog died in jail, the rest of my niggas crying bail
Laying in an iron cell, I tried going to church
But it seems like the Pastor keep molding a verse
Until my mom go in her purse
The Lord knowing I search, I needed therapy
My heart's beating heavily, I'm seeking heavenly
For the rest of me, my man says stay weeded, that's the recipe
Until the cops arrested me
My destiny is to leave a legacy, I don't have much
But if the Lord credit me, you'd see the best of me
I found a new life the day within the Bible page
While the popcorn's in the microwave, I hop on a tidal wave
I'm being stress free, I can do it if you let me
If I'm wrong then correct, or it just could be
Or it just could be

[Chorus x2: Killah Priest (singer)]
My life, money, girls and material things
In my life, it means alot to a player when he's chasing his dream
My life, it takes alot to turn a player around
My life, especially in the playa moment when he lays on the ground
(In my life)

[Killah Priest]
Since this record is nearly over, bring the song to it's closin'
Jahova, lights that novas over life and cultures
I'm seein' nights turn solar, ultra brightens the globe up
I roll up to niggas with no luck, slow bucks
Spent, hold up, silly cops coppin' doughnuts from bakeries
Shootouts awaken the seeds, D's chasin' the thieves
In projects hoping to receive large checks
For their children, police and the mayor chillin'
While they're the biggest villians of them all
I'm building with the children by the mall
I hear the rumors saying "Priest be on some other shit
Trying to unite the bloods and crips"
To show 'em how to overthrow this government
I start spazzin', talking about the mothership
Throwin' off my publicist and start talking about the Hebrew covenant
While I'm still thuggin' it, I keep it real, that's why they lovin' it
In my life...

[Chorus x2: Killah Priest (singer)]
My life, money, girls and material things
In my life, it means alot to a player when he's chasing his dream
My life, it takes alot to turn a player around
My life, especially in the playa moment when he lays on the ground
(In my life)
