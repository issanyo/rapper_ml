[Verse One]
The solar light made me glow all night
Become one with me, inwardly
Take these limbs off of me
Like a winter tree, flesh leaves
Shedding the body of his leaves like a breeze
Buzzing like a bee
Infinity, my center being
Divinity, I inner breathe
Higher awareness, higher of self bliss
A ball of energy pulling the chi from my pelvis
To believe to be free and careless
'till out of my body, the shell lift
Warm, calm, gone, psalms
Inner prayers to find my inward stairs
The center chair is just there
Nothing compares, how one become pairs
Back to one into layers, becomes clear
I'm not dead, but not alive
Only inside, the inner vibes
Snow leopard creeps upon me
But my surrounding changes to palm trees
The praying mantis, enchanting
With a swaying standing, advancement
My head turns seven directions at once
But I'm still staring at the front
A journey to the shortest distance
Sort of like a resistance
As the rigor mortis stiffens, the coffin's risen
Absorb and listen, I'm orbiting, I glisten
From wisdom I'm given, all in my system
Till it comes out of me like a prism
I'm fringing, cringing, looking for that emblem
Staring into the darkness inside myself
Cosmic calling for someone else
But the voice just echoes, echoes, echoes, echoes
Finally my soul let goes
No more depressed soul
Looking down a threshold
My heart begins to beating, I start believing
I start breathing
The art I'm conceiving from a dark region
No more pyramids, but these are clyramids
Changing to pyramids, this is my puramid

(Hook) x 2
This is the journey to see Cairo
Inside my soul
To seek higher than what I was told
Further than ancient Egypt
This is ancient Me-gypt
Hieroglyphics exchanged for tattoos
Believe it

[Verse Two]
The nine visible attributes
During my lyrical path, salute
Drop the jewels without parachutes
The math come in groups : Love, joy, peace
Long-suffering interrupting my being
Abruptly seeing
Gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness
Temperance, deliverance from outside interference
Join the experience, the spirit go inward, in
Remove the nine thousand year cloth, I cough
Arms coming uncrossed
Holding the Ankh for months, and millenniums
I spoke like many of tongues
Counting backwards from infinity
To the first century
All the way before B.C
You still can't figure me
From the song I did from a Didgeri[doo]
I am the temple, I am the pencil
I am the mental, I am the symbol
All tremble
I'm the peninsula to your state of mind
The inventor to the greatest rhyme
The adventurer, travel quasar time
I am the eye between the crack of dawn
I am the weight that broke day
I am the pilot aboard the higher planes
I'm the conductor on your train of thought
On your tracks to your past
Tunnel vision, wisdom
I am your opposing team when you're in the zone
Just to bring you home
Who am I? I'm just a poem
