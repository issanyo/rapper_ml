[Hook: Canibus]
Horseman, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, he’s a horseman
I’m a horseman
Horseman, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, he’s a horseman
I’m a horseman

[Verse 1: Canibus]
Killah Priest, Canibus, obstacle courses for HRSMN
Dismount then engage multiple targets
Shoulder to shoulder, face to face, we’re Saruman's soldiers
The heat from the Second Sun smolders
At 200 degrees I drop to my knees
Priest told me to breathe, the time signature freeze
I am now at peace, the ocean conveyer belt flows to the east
The new Silk Road will host the beast
Wo-ai-ni translate speech
Silver Fox trades herbal spices to eat for rice and meat
In the parking lot we drill doing Muy Tai Chi
Tell Mook to call me after I write to that beat
The dart spitter, thought ninja, sharp thinker
Acupuncture heart pincher ricochet off the rickshaw nigga
Hard feet, soft tendons, medicine, my pontoons walk on rivers
"But why you still walk with a limp, Mr?"
I was injured I self-administered apple cider, garlic and vinegar
I feel better than I did in December
Used to be gone till November, remember?
Now I got security sensors for side exits, back door and entrance
Posted up with night vision like lizard in Dark Knight prison
The wise old owl with camouflage feathers
Not to mention there’s not even a pot to piss in
Wipe my ass with cardboard next doctor visit

[Hook: Canibus]
I’m a horseman, he’s a horseman
I’m a horseman
Horseman, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, Priest a horseman
We the Horsemen
The clan, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, Priest a horseman
We the Horsemen

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Guns and blow, create a thunder hole for the young and old
Black hole when crack soul protect the globe
Crossbow for the lost souls in the last toll
Pay yours fares in the air, the end is near
Nah, the end is here, description of giant smoke stacked
Blue plasma boil, blood in the soil, fight over spoil
Gold or all out in Iraq, stress disorders
And test the water, death or slaughter
Protect your quarter, times are shorter
Got my preacher at the altar
No home cooked meals, just blood, sweat and steel
Army shield, battle field, shoot to kill
Castle hill, arrow steel, post traumatic
Automatic, break your bones into fragments
Blue dragnet, your crew will scavenge, move tragic
The Hell jumpers and shell dumpers, they failed in numbers
Coming in tanks and Hummers, a cold day in the summer
Forged passports, we dodge the task force
Traps across, who get the cops off
I’m at the dock with the boss Matthew Markoff
We laugh as we dash like hot sauce

[Hook: Canibus]
Horseman, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, Priest a horseman
We the Horseman
The clan, graze like goats off the land
Expand, then we chop it up like lamb
I’m a horseman, Priest a horseman
We the Horsemen
