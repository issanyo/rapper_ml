Between the streets of Brooklyn where the gates are Putnam
Cats are looking, shooutouts with pounds from crews
Either town you cats down the mood
If it's Bed-Stuy, Feds eye
If it's Brownsville then the pounds are real
If they look you up and down like who this clown, just peel
If it's Fort Green, shorty might not be more 14
Walk mean, shoot you anotehr tale of New York scene
If it's Red Hook we dead shook
Got projects after projects, not even the Feds look
If it's Crown Heights, stand around lights
They come out of shadows, smell of death and gun barrels
They wear black apparel, the streets are black and narrow
This go for all Brooklyn underworld allegience
Who by night gather up their teams and
Lobbies are basements for secret meetings, greetings

Streets be all the same, come join our gang
We get high and kill 'til we fall in the flames
I promise you everything til it's ball and chains
But if you die tonight I charge through the gauge
