[Intro: (child) Killah Priest]
(One two, one two)
No doubt
(The microphone's on)
Cross my heart, hope to die, word is bond
(I've been waiting along time for this)
Here we go, Killah Priest, '97, '98
Y'all know somethin'?

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
It's the Byzantine king, supreme
All kneel kiss the ring into a Elohim
I blow steam from the families of the Maccabees
Smack emcees, watch 'em scream, "Your Majesty!"
Make 'em suffer the capacity of tragedy
Hold the crowd down like gravity
Back the fuck off, stop grabbin' me, hands off me
Niggas start to bore me, I'm gettin' sleepy, I need some coffee
Me and my Wu-bandits, we bury niggas deep in the canvas
Body bandage like some mummies
You fucking dummies, you can't take nothing from me
It's the longest waited, the most anticipated, the album hesitated
Scream the name out, "Killah Priest!"
I leave the blood spilling in the streets
I'm from the dark hills of Brownsville
The seven shields on windmills across the killin' fields
Never forget it, tell them rap critics
I speak in arithmetics, so they can never get it
I'm too scientific, lyrics explicit
I roll with thirsty niggas, thieves and killers
Tigers, gorillas, faces like Godzilla
We stomp rappers that smile like a car dealer
The God iller, cross my heart hope to die
We multiply, by the hundreds, drunken by the thousand
See me outside your show browsin', beating up your soundmen
Player haters and players, we give 'em cold stares
Any last prayers?

[Verse 2: Inspectah Deck]
Concrete techniques, bomb beats that cause casualties
My faculty, hold it down like gravity
Rapidly threaten like weapons to adolescents
Ghetto residents quick to past tense your present
State of the slums, kill for a plate of crumbs
Fake ones, they're coarse with smiles and snake tongues
I'm deep into this,I sometimes gasp for air
Deadly warfare, hot blocks, cops, and cold stares
Shots blare like fireworks on July the 4th
Weapons get tossed, fugitive slidin' off
My forces combine, new world, 2009
Digital criminals, we make mills in cybercrime
It's all planned ahead 2 times, I see the signs through a great mind
The heaviest chains could not bind

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
We stare you eye to eye, we tell the truth no lie
We cross our heart and hope to die, hope to die

[Verse 3: Genius/GZA]
High ranked officials in armed tanks with missiles
Blood drizzle, simple fact, you slept on the issue
That before you started jerkin' off Joysticks and Sega
I was rockin' off 100 watt amps in Cerwin-Vega
True fine tune it, ship enough units
MCs ask, "Who be those rhyme killers in masks?"
No doubt, difficult task to last in the square
Beware, infinite amount of darts is in the air
I'm victorious with no opponents and blast through components
With microphonics, watch the whole world live the moment
Anything anti that came approachin' this
Our incapable love speech remains motionless

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
We stare you eye to eye, we tell the truth no lie
We cross our heart and hope to die, hope to die
We stare you eye to eye, we tell the truth no lie
We cross our heart and hope to die, hope to die
We hope to die..
