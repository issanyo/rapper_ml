[Intro: Killah Priest]
Uh oh, yo 4th what’s the deal?
Yo Amir, this is what we got to do right now?
The Golden Deer Priest, the Eight Deer Ocelot Claw
4th, we got to go in again? Aight, let’s go, yo

[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Anunnakis with animal bodies scanning safari
Shape-shift, land of Mugabe, that’s where the god be
With my Sumerian colleagues, lighters, cameras in lobbies
I’m channelling Gandhi, killers with hammers and party
The Technology Lord fights with a Mechanical Army
It’s the writer on the clay tablets, grave of the abbots
Pray through the Sabbath, God word splays at the dragon
His captain and his cabin
Engineer the beast gears with Satan mechanics
Pagans invaded our campus, nation implanted
The blood in my veins is true blue, blood in my wings is from Nibiru
The blood of a king, celestial beings, the Essenes, now who you?

[Break: Killah Priest]
Yo God
Matter of fact, what’s today’s mathematics?
Listen God, hold up

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
I’m the remnant of God descendants, star defender
The kindreds of all existence, start remember
Divine fist of the North Dipper
Secrets to challenge your chakras for my lost niggas
Or aka Walter Killah or meet my fist of the blue sky
The Wu cry (Zuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu!) Zu
Now my Zu-Tribe, sacred fist of the Southern Star
God governs my bars, my style is above and beyond
The Dogon lift up the Trilithon
The Poem-Killah had formed, the Rap Christ lay on pillars of thorns
The 8 Deer Ocelot Claw, prophet on walls
Great as the Lord, great is his name
Swinging sword at cyborgs and robots
And y’all go watch wind-up toys, ya niggas get your throat chopped

[Outro: Killah Priest]
Yeah, you know what I mean?..
The Psychic World, the Golden Deer, the Great Silent
Told y’all, Priest, told y’all, I’m out of here
