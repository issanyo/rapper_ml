[Intro: Killah Priest]
Yeah, Killah Priest, Timbo King
Maccabeez, nigga, whatever we do
Heaven Razah, where you at?
We all together, you know what time it is
This is it...

[Killah Priest]
Fall back and analyze, a man rarely seen
Before the cameras eyes, two cannons by his side
Heart's so real, that he can not die
God's my shield, I'm ready to ride
When I was young I'm into breaks by dope phenoms
Now I'mma stare up to space with guns in my palms
Light storms, the cloud forms, the night is born
Draw swords, I'm ready for war
I'm lords over ya'll laws, ya'll rappers, ya'll used to be hot
But now ya'll make me bored, now it's back to board
Back to the core, back to the backsores, putting in work
Back to the block, putting ya'll in the dirt
Bullets insert, lead that comes out, you niggas'll squirt
Lead all over the turf, limbs'll hurt
Sanity is the curse, Priesthood, nigga
Hold guns like Clint Eastwood, plan to eat good, nigga

[Chorus: Killah Priest]
Yeah.. the Maccabee Ridaz
Maccabee Ridaz
Yo, it's the Maccabee Ridaz
It's the Maccabee Ridaz

[Killah Priest]
I'm a monster, ready to conquer
Hit ya'll muthafuckas with the power of a Tonka
Truck, I don't give a fuck, guns'll buck
Niggas'll duck, shots start to roll
Under the fucking cops... yeah... toll
Tell the brothers, straight off the head...
Straight off the lead... from guns to automatic
And it's all the static, comical army grab it
Yeah, ya'll niggas is maggots, unload the ratchet
Gats spits, niggas placed in caskets
Blow muthafucking paper, yo straight off the head, it's my nature
I put it down, yeah, yeah, Timbo, you gon' paint the ground
Fuck that... guns pat, Maccabeez muthafucka, one more time

[Chorus w/ ad-libs]

[Timbo King]
Let's ride on 'em, let's ride on 'em
Fuck them niggas, fuck them niggas
Them niggas busboys, always catching the bus, boy
The game's foul, who can you trust, boy?
Bo, shepherd king, repping Brook, Crook, go 'head and move, rook
Smoking tobacco, my niggas blacko
Slap niggas, mean what I say
Say what I mean, gangsta lean, Tim Brown slaughterhouse
I want big money, ready to die, big money
Keep food up in the fridge, money
Revolutionary gun talk... ride on 'em, ride on 'em
