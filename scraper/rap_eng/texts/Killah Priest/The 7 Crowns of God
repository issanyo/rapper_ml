[Verse 1]
Escorted to my torment, my pen opened up the coffin
It's horrid and quite awkward
Let's walk with, Walter, forward
See me trying on God's ornaments
The hooded King gleam like porcelain
Y'all seen the portrait in portions
It immolates greatness like 'The Offering'
Prince of the presence - The legend
To befriend, to call them brethrens
But that's dead when, you fill his ears with poisons
What's his origin? You're supposed to enjoy friends
But instead you try to exploit them
Now you trying to avoid them
Shape-shift your weed branches with fire
Blow out the negative gases, I rap with passion
Not for fashion, to provoke reaction
Your chances are slim for being shady
I'll have all of 'em relapsing, I spit classics
Open your mind and your mouth is where I fit the magic
Open the canvas of your thoughts is where I spit the graphics

[Hook] (x2)
A-alikes is like mind
A-alikes is like mind
Day and night I write rhymes
Day and night I write rhymes

[Verse 2]
I'm chasing destiny, past my future, it's therapy
Telepathy, look at my face, see a ruler
One day riding my scooter, the wheels came off, became horses
The seat became a chariot, my yard into a fortress
I'm sitting off a cliff, the sky open, begin talking
Telling me my fortune, saying I should be hit with stones
They should break my bones
Leave me on the ground and die all alone
Bud out your bones
I will stack it like Legos
The dirt I will stretch it out like Play-Doh
And form a body, then breathe the breath of life
You will be resurrected with mics
Then form a hex with light
There will be no copies, you are mine

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 3]
Now hold on, let me explain
God captured greatness, shaped it into a form of a brain
I was born to be king, 'The Offering' was drawn in the flame
But this time adore me with rings
Not gold rings, but rings around Saturn
Check the pattern
Of rhymes I wrote, and that I mastered in
Okay, he mix greatness with immortality
And added God morality
A throne spoke the name of Priest
From a palace on the mountain right off the sea
It said the 'Psychic World of Walter Reed'
I perform lyrical sorcery
God's tailors made my regalia
Lightning from my fringes, and thunder for embroidery
My hand that candles, offers two CDs
The secret private life of plants
The diligent and militant, commodity and colonies of ants
The spiritual and telekinetic mind of children
All rolled up in rhymes that are chilling
Black Lost Tribes of Israel, official
With bars of truth
Chopped up in crystal, no fishscales
Baking powder of Satan power, devoured
Pots of boiling water of Torah
Though the dragon with his legion of demons screaming
In my coke kettles of slaughter
Place a capsule of your rap dudes to take back to school
This is something to relapse to

[Hook] (x2)
