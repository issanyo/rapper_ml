[Killah Priest]
They all attend, his demons, evil spirits, lord of the wind
Fallen angels, black abyss, bought most of his friends
His coffins full of abortions
Outside the black temple, dragons were swarmin'
Enormous, abomination came wit the children of Cain
Damnation and hell join hands
Black rain that anoints to his blood clan
Blasphemous near his casket weepin'
Comin' in multitude of demons, lost souls
Followed by a mass of heathens
Complainin', crows were screamin'
Then somethin' parted the rain
The stars changed
Ultimate light entered the room as God came
His face had my face and half of the entire human race
He walked in God dimensions and God thought
God on looks, God talks, the quiet sung dark musically
Sung dark musically, they read the devil's eulogy

From the end of heaven and Earth, came one walkin'
A thousand year curse, talkin'
From the direful of abyss
His wife leans over kisses his hard dead lips
The room smells like burnt sofa
Above his body, a tall gothic sculpture
Scriptures were written by Hitler
Stalin, Darwin and Idi Amin
The ET's arrive on the scene
I stood in the back, it was new to me

The devil's eulogy, they read it
They read the devil's eulogy
I read the devil's eulogy
No foolery, we hung up his jewelry
This is it, the description of hit-list
