[Sample]
In the beginning, God created the Heaven and the Earth

[Killah Priest (George Clinton)]
(Never met a force) I am the one
(Never met a force)
(Metaphysically in the state of euphoria)
Behold, I am the one
(You are the one)

[Killah Priest]
Within dark heavens, hands open up books
Billion eyes stare before 'em as the audience look
Cosmic lights, it's gothic in the midst of the night
A state of nothingness, a shear bliss descended from heights
From gases, I'm drifting to a liquid to ice
Becoming frozen, the one who was chosen for life
It was I, just a spirit transended from Ja
The 7 heavens, the sixth plain, they switching my brain
I'm like "Damn, I'm being transformed to man from angel"
I thought it'd be painful, then he reached down his hands
Forming the sands, "Let us make man and stand until the land
Let's make him dynamic after our likeness
Making him psychic, seeing it was right with our conscience
In our own image, but let's give him limits
Thus his needs for seeds and his womens
And I will plant his emblem to bring him back in rememberance
In time to come, for he was told 'I am the one, I am the one'"

[Chorus: Killah Priest (George Clinton)]
(You are..)
(Never met a force lead to metaphys
Metaphysically in a state of euphoria, euphoria)
(Never met a force lead to metaphys, in a state of euphoria, metaphysically)
I am the one
(We were tight back then)
(Grew tight as a love)
(But like the fortune teller, she was right, here we are, so tight)
(So tight)
I am the one, behold

[Killah Priest]
So there I was, flesh and blood, black mud on my face
Naked I came from a celestial plain descended from space
In a distance, my existence was fallen from grace
And in an instant, became an infant, I will fall in this place
Called Earth, made of plant, rock, water, and dirt
And a name that I forgot, was called Walter at first
They cut my umbilical cord, a toddler
I learned how to scribble on floors, I got older
And learned how to dribble a ball
Until the controller opened up my spiritual door
My brain novas and out my mouth, the lyrics will pour
I was born with a seven on my chest, ya'll decipher the rest
It's just begun, because ya'll will know soon
I am the one, behold, I am the one

[Chorus: Killah Priest (George Clinton)]
(Tight as the snug of your embrace)
(We still got the love that fills this place)
(I've held in your arms, but never squeezed too tight)
(Never met a force metaphys
Metaphysically in a state of euphoria, euphoria)
I am the one
(Never met a force lead to metaphys, in a state of euphoria, metaphysically)
(Be yourself if you want the best, be yourself)
(Ask them what we did and when we did it, they'll say 'fuck 'em up')
(Grew tight as a love)
(But like the fortune teller, she was right, here we are, so tight)
(So tight)
Behold, I am the one
(Grew tight as a love)
(But like the fortune teller, she was right, here we are, so tight)
(So tight)
(How late do you have to be before you're absent?)
(In your indos and in your outdos)
(This is, is all a war, as it is, so shall it be)
(If being is what it's about, I is)
(If being is what it's about, I is)
(What goes up, has to come down)
