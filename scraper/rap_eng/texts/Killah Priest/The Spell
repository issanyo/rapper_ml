The candle burns next to a silver bowl, above that
A portrait of a killer known of formerly as a priest
Ceremony ceased tabernacle released
700 jackals loose in the streets
The ashes of his enemies blow under his feet
Thunder and sleet blow doors open, in the cathedral
The candles go out-the portrait open his mouth-spit
Apocalypse, dark mist drift past MCs with blood on their head
Sworn for the dead, spread the skies out like an endless table cloth
Chop ya legs both off, stable you in the navel with a pitchfork
This is witch talk-warlock rhymes with boss hog grimes
Snatch outcha mind-put it at the end of ya spine
Brush ya teeth with my nine-who wanna battle
Let’s take a raffle
I’ll meet you with a scalpel, slice ya Adam’s apple
Never disturb the dead-ya bones are spread
Poems are said, Ouija board spells out
Priest Of War, you’ll be eaten by my sword
The man unfinished I throw you in god’s prison
You do a sentence of repentance
There’s no remembrance of forgiveness, my torture’s endless
Inches for inches, I’m relentless
I go into heaven, kick the gates in
Fight angels-get you to shake
Drag ya ass out by ya halo up that street paved with gold
Then I throw yo ass back to the globe
See I own ya soul, you go to hell
I fight against bats just to get you  back
I wrestle devils, run through fire
Kill demons just to finish ya beatin’
While ya friends still grievin’
I’m worse than death, I’m worse than pain
My lyrics kill again and again
Liliths kiss you, take you to the cave near the red sea
Where the skeleton remains of the dead MCs
Ya flesh leave depression proceeds
Walk down my stairs of echo, within my ring of Texas chainsaws
You came as war, came with the devil
Leviathan fiery breath breathed upon you
The planet’s my footstool
The king of Gog and Magog, the great grandsons of Nimrod
Sacrifice his limbs to my god
When they buried Medusa she left a graveyard full of statues
Which rap would you choose?
Which axe shall I use?
Witch hunt the devil asked for you
Tie you to a stake
Like Joan of Arc-these forms of art
Of galleries are different ways of ya casualties
You die violently!
I write with a violent pen
Someone like I’m tattin’ ya skin
When I spit the entire Vatican cringe
I’m back for you again
Let the bats ascendI come from hell’s wide mouth
I got you! Now I cry out
Sittin’ on the strange tree-It’s the great wise owl
Join me in The Land of Howls
