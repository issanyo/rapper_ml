[Killah Priest]
My pen's a microscope
Beneath its lens show real life I wrote
From all my sins to my righteous quotes
I look within and realize there's hope
I begin to cringe, struck by lightning bolts
From outter realms I saw Michaels bow
The angel'll sin just like a ghost
I begin to cleanse, speak under the Bible's oath
And when I end how many mics I broke?
Begin to live the words Christ has spoke
They're losing the friends desired most
The half-less mind, their chance to shine
They blast that nine, that glass of wine
They handed me insanity
Vanity families of humanity
Stay with me through calamities
The dark skies have electric fields
See the wheel within wheels, impregnable skills
Thousands of volts from post lasers
Nonlinear optics behind quasars
Within the triple stages of dark there's a black stars
Around the universal cosmic, lost NASA
Somewhere there you'll find my raps but only have bars
We gave the devil his time, now rebel in the mind
The ghettos designed to keep us sleepers
The grim reaper meet us, poor education
We explore revelation
War of the nations, claw of the pagans
Washington, watch Shaitan
See the mission through man made religion
In the floor of Masons

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Shout -- x9
Live -- x9
Love -- x8
Gods Time -- x5

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
From money and wealth, you'll ugly yourself
The hungrier I felt with nothing to feed me, streets will mislead me
Where the eyes are greedy, I vibe on CDs, his eyes on TVs
The cause of justice and missing no expectation
No interpretation, I'm cold with vexation
My soul is a wreck waiting
Recreation with mind and spirit combined let's feel this
It's time we hear this, mind is sheer bliss
From being rebellious, overzealous or too jealous
Make us failures, mistakes from elders
From being careless, god help us, Satan held us for decades
Time to cross over to the next phase
The atheist is amazed at this
Awaketh thou sluggard, why covet thy brother
Consider the ant that gives it to the plant
The plant gives to them, so be it to all men

[Hook: Killah Priest]
Shout, shout, shout, shout
Shout, shout, shout, shout, shout
Live, live, live, live
Live, live, live, live, live
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
God's Time -- x5

[Verse 3: Killah Priest]
The Devil trembles when he knows the body's the temple
And God is in you, it's hard to continue when it's hard to offend you
He starts to set traps, that have you setback
The last round in this death match, so strengthen where you're best at
I promise you won't regret that
Was I regarded as Job? Or should I take the carpenter's role?
It's dark in this hole, that's as far as it goes
Harps of gold, impossible, pot as a rose
Remarkable soul, the resistance, instincts intakes a poisons
The devil's enjoyment is so annoying
Exploiting, morally destroying
Around a flag their serpent's coiling
My spirit's boiling, it's simple
If we sin don't do it again, ask for forgiveness
This privilege saves us from max in their prison
Attraction of wisdom, not this plastic system
The faction, we victims
The aspen is venom, relax and it's your ending
Families deprived of their lives
The archives, lost tribe, pork rinds
But it's a new era, a new beginning
A new ending, a new time, only a few inches
We getting closer, you choose, you make a decision
No collision, turn off the television
The Hell in women eyes and males we like we failed the mission
It's disciplince, militance, no tolerance for the ignorance
We live again, refuse to lose, spark minds it's God Time
Every bar in this line is stars aligned
Turn on the searchlight, see we the owners of the birthright
Reverse the curse like we sold the drugs that's owed to us
Let's get what's owed to us, what's really owed to us
We bust the guns when we was young
Now it's change a higher plane, the sky is in my range
The third, I have wings

(Hook) Priest
