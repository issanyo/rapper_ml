[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Sumerian Gods
Sumerian Gods was Anu, Enki and Enlil
Abraham, Ishmael, Issac. Israel
Sun, moon and star, man and woman embryo
Inhale., silver gold emeralds
Skin and nail, now discover stem cells
Look up, now discover Chem-trails
Right above, hay-stacked barn with windmill
Travel foreign countries where they bury mummies where Monks be
Travel to Istanbul to the castles of Hungary
Studying my Chakras, drinking ayahuasca
Gave me psychic thoughts
My spirit God morphed into a Jaguar
My brains took off like NASA
Ran around the jungles fast as NASCAR
Talking with the faces of the Egyptian cat God
Chewing holes in the sky, follow the black star
The tarot card shows the Avatar
Meet the priest named (Drakkar?)
[?]
Told me focus on the inner-Lotus, notice the petals
Voice sounded kinda Polish, enemy roses
This old Devil, I'm the cold rebel, Slash, Othello
Parts of the mothership is inside of the Ark of the Covenant
Cain received the mark for his punishment
From the hand of God, then fled to the Land of Nod
Where he camouflaged, lift the candle see a scar
Embarrassed he vanished and start to scavenge
Then found the people that were here before his parents
There, he took their women, hand in marriage
Bare children that will soon invade the planet with killings
And declare their selves as gods, but what odd?
Who were these people from the Land of Nod? [?]
There lied a King who ruled with vigor
Stay with me so don't lose the picture
You want a wife you can choose my sister
You see my kingdom we can make it bigger
We are the serpent people
Many Gods we worship, this ones the Eagle
Sodom, Gomorrah, [?]
Bella, the fortune teller caught the feller
We traveled more east, create the Dragon, the Kundalhini
The Gini. L.gigi
Our gods have war, our gods have sex
Our gods get jealous, our gods get vexed
I was visited by an Angel named Abel
He told me I should save you

[Outro: Killah Priest]
The headdress of a bull
His skin covered with wool
[?]
They tried to trick her with wine and liquor
What a fine mixture
