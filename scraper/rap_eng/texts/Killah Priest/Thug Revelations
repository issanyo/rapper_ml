[Intro: (Daughters of Zion) Killah Priest]
(Satan, we're gonna tear your kingdom down)
{*gunshots*}
Ah, Johnny, yo, got shot, my baby, Johnny
{*gunshots*}
(Satan, we're gonna tear your kingdom down)
My baby, why?
(Oh yea)
No, no, no
(We're in your kingdom, oh lordy.. oh lordy, that's alright)
Watch your back
{*gunshots*}

{*beat kicks in*}

[Intro Pt. II: (singer) Daddy Rose [Killah Priest]]
(Tell me where, have I seen you somewhere before)
Maccabean empire, Masada beloved
(Was it in a dream?, When an angel closed my eyes and I saw)
Daddy Rose the God
(Tell me where, have I seen you somewhere before)
Maccabean scholar
(Was it in a dream? When an angel closed my eyes and I saw)
[Everybody shall repent and show it, Priesthood, yea]

[Daddy Rose]
Holy scriptures, the state's prosecutors study Leonardo's pictures
All fraud from the renaissance age
Unfold the page, Golden Gates turn to rust
Man controlled like a puppet, the Earth is center stage
I've been deceived by modern day Eve with a weave
Poison me with lust from venom, ever since she was made
From the rib cage, in a world of theatrics
Same wantin new Babylon, the Mac spits
Rose remain deep, like the masters who crafted ecclesiastics
Telepathics, communicate by telegraphics
Bomb and corrupt Catholics
Tie 'em to the stake like Joan of Arc then burn 'em to ashes
Hard rush when I catch slavery flashes
Been born again like Paul on his way to Demascus
Any questions? Just ask us
Standin' on the four corners of the Earth
Four kings, 8 wings, black halos, son we got 'em
Direct from Hell's bottom, ridin on a pale horse
With a sword in my hand, comin to destroy Sadaam

[Hook: Killah Priest (Daughters of Zion)]
(Tell me where, have I seen you somewhere before)
(Was it in a dream?)
Palms up nigga, palms up nigga
Head down nigga, head down nigga
(When an angel closed my eyes and I saw)
Face the east nigga, face the east nigga
(Tell me where, have I seen you somewhere before)
Then pray my nigga, pray my nigga
(Was it in a dream?)
Palms up nigga, palms up nigga
Head down nigga, head down nigga
(When an angel closed my eyes and I saw)
Face the east nigga, face the east nigga
Then pray my nigga, pray my nigga

[Sauldin]
Sauldin Rose, alias in me and Maccabees
My faculties stuck up jewels, 4 different diamonds
I rock jewels, run up in your temple for manuals
Annual bangouts from Jericho to New Jerus'
I walk through my hood like Christ with my apostles
Thief in the night, niggas watch my light reflect through my ice
The flame in my eyes, Gabriel's blood on my wings
Seven fold solo man, Eloheim crowned king
I walk through the desert, the Lord is my shepherd
I steppeth in the name of my father to pharoahs and fiends
Feed independence, I be the black stone in a column
My Mac-11 scope the seventh pope of Romaness scholars
My throne, is seated in soul, a sembiance placed in mine
The breath of life, livin spirit, now my soul embrace the knowledge
As I step in light, while the thug in me is chasin shine
I rise above the low and have the heat at guys takin up space of mine

[Killah Priest]
Yo, yo, yo, ayo
{*speaking foreign tongue*}
Yo
Black posse, clap guns at the anarchy
White man in the van watch me
Video cams is in the lobby
We change skin tones like chameleons so they can't spot me
Runnin out the buildin, cops shot me
I played dead on the ground like you cowards got me
Until I heard the engine of my man's Kawasaki
I raised off the ground mad cocky
He shot past it and snatched my body
We cocked a shottie, popped three at the swat team
The black helicopters swoopin down, flashin (What? What? What?)
Thousand volt watt beams, watchin on TV screens
Streets are flooded by the Neo-Nazis
That's when Gabriel gave me shells
Then I load my automatic and I blaze the world
Fuck this world and everything in it
I ain't gonna stop until my job is finished
And my words are infinite
My life is governed by a higher force
Sometimes I think I'll end up like Christ and die on a cross
The sacrifice, close my eyes and the fire come forth
Start spazzin then I blackout, I'm grabbin my Mac
Clap at the dragon, the beast, that paddin my streets
It's organized in the hood where we gaggin police
I wake up stabbin my sheets, see the monster grabbin my feet
Pullin me beneath, havin a head like Bill Gates
With a mouth full of platinum teeth
Imagine my grief, I'm gaspin, blastin my heat
The assassins

[Hook: Killah Priest (Daughters of Zion)]
(Tell me where, have I seen you somewhere before)

Face the east nigga, face the east nigga
(Tell me where, have I seen you somewhere before)
Then pray my nigga, pray my nigga
(Was it in a dream?)
Palms up nigga, palms up nigga
Head down nigga, head down nigga

Through a mangy rain, save the king of us
Let's get rid of the different but the sands the same and they remain
We're an pain and we're here to save all that man has done
Cuz the most high told us this is all for us
