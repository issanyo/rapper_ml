(Chorus) Kamachi 4x
These are tablets; these are 'Scrolls'
The work is a magic healing our souls

[Chief Kamachi]
Yeah, my life changed when I seen my son at birth
It's a blessing just to breathe and come to Earth
Limited bodies, infinite minds
12 months seven planets distribute the signs
The Chinese say; "life follows cycles of nine"
The OGs say; "son hold up a rifle for mine"
It's so dark now, don't think the righteous will shine
But I think like all 12 disciples combined
With my spiritual hands, trying to reach for your spine
It's like magic, when I put a jewel in your bomb
There's only one God, that's the first rule of Islam
I live for the sword, I'm true to the bomb
I'm the soul of black soldiers that was blew up in 'Nam
Over white candles, reciting the 23rd Psalm
Stay connected thru the storm and the calm
Spirits on the other side know my word "born"
Peculiar magician soul of Physician
Heal the world, analyze, just as the stars position
It's the Mic Christ, all the atheist petition
Kamachi, back on my mystic mission

(Chorus) Kamachi 4x

[Killah Priest]
I wanted to be wise as Solomon
Had a role model like him
It was Kane and Rakim
I would follow my pen
I would see galaxies of emcees
In the form of astrology
In darkness, I would follow their lead
Lights, in the shape of mics
With different planets, days and nights
I would crave to write, back down to the Earth
In the new form of rebirth
Defined as God, deep search and study ME first
I look within, I got took within
I found Brooklyn, in the heart, where I put my pen
Created rhymes, made good for men and women
Like the tree of life and everyday I breath I write
That was my freedom rights, my pen and pad
That was my Kingdom of Christ, no distractions
That's backwards, what I practice
A rap gift, that I spew out, was magic

(Chorus) Kamachi 4x
