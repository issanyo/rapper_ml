[Verse 1: Sean Price]

Yo I punch your face off, I'm straight karate shit
You know I body shit, your verse is pile of shit
The worst rapper, the first rapper, to neglect this child nigga
I birth bastards, listen, five servings on this Chinese chicken
Our rhyme ridden, I'm Siamese trippin'
Let's smoke, nigga the gun'll pound rappers
In the dirt, jerk, you an underground rapper
Caviar Gold smokin', smoking shotgun with the
The sign say "No smokin'"
I'm so potent, I'm so focused
You so broke, nobody notice
Wet mama, smokin' the wet daddy
Wanna get her partner, choke on the sket badly, P
I smack the shit out a punk
Make your eyes celebrate like Black History Month
Mothafucka

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
That's how we do it nigga
I smack rappers so hard I leave prints on
They great grand children, mad mad that I kill 'em
My hand become their fan emblem
A sign of good faith, niggas catchin' feelin's
Put his hand in the suitcase
Stuff his ass back into his mother's womb
Body bag, here's a couple shotty blasts
This the bedroom, he in the bathroom
Niggas wearin' Sassoon
Get your punk ass out of the karate class
Nigga, I divide one livin' into two
Multiple bodies, bullets that'll subtract you
Then add a few, I'll probably take this verse
And stuff it in his head too
Make his head burst, and stuff his soul in the dirt
I eat rappers like a bowl of dessert
They go beserk, this that rap that make your neck jerk
I embody the flow, now all I need is a sweatshirt
W-W-W dot fuck you up network
The rap'll remember like cush express
Bust his chest then took his breath for Brooklyn's best
I roll you up like weed, smoke you like a ton of trees
Pokin' outta your sleeves
We in the laboratory, where all weed's categories
Mad story, with different flavors before me
Flowers, Caviar Gold hit the stove and
Lighten up the highest grade, the finest fade
Hash oil when the wrapper's unfoiled
We chief the kush, experts of the kief technique
Caviar Gold, know what I mean
Shouts out to Zodiak, kush express
Best weed on the planet, Caviar Gold
You know what I mean, let it boil
Crush it up into little flakes and flowers
