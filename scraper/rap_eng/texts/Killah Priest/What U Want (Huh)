[Hook] (x4)
So what you want, huh?
So what they want, huh?

[Verse 1]
The bullet or the bribe, cartels bomb shells
Cocktails with wine, poison choices under the sky
Fireworks, dye in the dirt, crime experts
Nine in his shirt, street line the work
God design, stars burst
My mind twine with the universe
Thru this verse get reclined
Bone analysts await the baggages
Quicker Judges who await the packages
Gats to rib, all under cameras
Here come the savages
Master this, in one place 'till I finish the line

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2]
Organized crime are murdering cops
Shark attorney eat kids swerving on blocks
Burial plots, machine gun shots
Supreme got knocked
Or the psychic of the righteous
What draws me to write this?
Is it the universe hands or what the planets demand?
Or is the essence that brings a hundred Gods on my presence to stand?
What makes me write this record?
What makes him give this message? (I don't know)
Is it just us or justice when this mic blow amps

[Hook] (x4)

[Verse 3]
Two trillion demons that I trapped in my ring
Flow thru my chips like people walking thru Beijing
Praise the king, Polonius dream
Body building with lyrics
Rap increase till I'm labeled supreme
I gave y'all eternal life
Day turns to night
From the grave I returned to the mic
To the page I turn on to write
No amen, y'all pagans are playing
With the one man nation
You infidels, gnashing of teeth
Smell the heat as I send you to hell beneath
Dethrone who? The child disowns you

[Hook] (x4)
