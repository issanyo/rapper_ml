[Killah Priest]
Rhymes compressed in the complex conscious
Context concepts its contents
Here to comet, come pest conquest is accomplished
On the planet till the mind launches
Thoughts teleport to the realms of darkness
Like a cosmic starship, subconscious where God sits

Standing on the shoulders of the galaxies looking at a New Reality
Above the Earth, beneath Gods balcony
Through the Universe through the eyes of the storm in the forms of an Odyssey
Shooting torpedoes at the evil from the wheel of Ezekiel with the wings of an Eagle
I come to heal the people, snatch the seal and reveal the Hebrews
Nimrod birthday, day of Christmas
Food for thought out of satellite dishes
I snatch out your biochip, rearrange your manuscript
Make you into a brand new kick
A secret life of Daniel Smith, a robot that will grow in a box
Put codes in his clock, your head explode when I flow off top

Four kings ruled for seven thousand years
In a time heaven fell from the spheres
Priest, the legend would appear
With Angelical weapons in his gear
Like war-hammer, helmets with deer antlers
On the throne with pair of panthers
Warlocks and Witch elves with the powers to switch realms
Got owls to spit spells, got knives that will split elks
Warrior face with thick whelps
Why need a fountain of youth, when I’m surrounded by Zeus
Well rounded in the truth, giant fist pound through the roof
MCs get hit with the nukes
I arrive at the door of immortality violently
Those of challenge me, I have a dead MC gallery
A mortuary with heads on the doors are scary
These raps walls are heavy, get grabbed by the paws of the hairy
I kill MCs, destroy their souls
Catch ’em at the crossroads with crossbrow
On a spirit horse surrounded by red crows
Like I read those dead scrolls
And the dead rose, Angels breaking their bones
Their wings turn into stone as they're returning home
Into the divine realm from the mortal world back to the mind-elm
This rapper’s a juggernaut, what I jot is the brother lot
MCs are turn to the pillars of salt
Killah’s a force, revealing the source, still in the vault
Made with the steel and the bolt, like Peyton Manny I’m standing

A plethera of greatness shaped into a crown of praises
God of the ages, sacred language found in my pages, catch phrases
GodzWrath, bars of math and science
Vampire Vikings Insane asylums, tyrants and Lunatic Island
Trials of witches, bow for forgiveness
Head full of stitches, bed full of crickets
Peaceful walks through the cemeteries
Hail Mary sends the worry
Body swinging from the tree of knowledge, Adam and Eve
It goes slower and slower
Purple lips, the hand's getting colder and colder
On his skin were a bag and stick
On his forehead is written Judas, I left the game with music
Came back engulf the flames with shooters
With Ein Sof, the name of the rulers
Mediate on the will of the star trooper
Tea running down my face like Buddha

Body of Light, the Book of Life
The Body of Light
