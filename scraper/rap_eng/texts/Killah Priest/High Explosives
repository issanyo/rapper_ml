[Hook]
I'm a, space cadet, with a tape and a cassette
Player, mine faster than prayer, or pass me the ozone layer
A better tape then I'm there, high explosives
Lyrics are high explosives..

Chorus

Been up, dated, microphone mighty king David
My eyes have seen the spaceship, lying of Judah
High exalted, mystic ruler, black stone call me
Abduler, skin made of solid pewter, my wisdom takes off
With such great force, global space walk
I breaked off leaving legs, frost, shake the planet off
Cause different ships, mountains and cliffs, planet shifts
Mind drifts, this is it, I've been abducted
No longer stuck with, the corrupted
9 to 5 puppets, I blew away my change, buck it
Bite my crutches, the faces of the public
Scream for justice..

Chorus 2X

Stalked like Moses, lead the hopeless
Raise ? water hoses, I stomped the devil like a bed of roses
Drinking ?, raw locus, mind full of high explosives
Armored tanks stay focused, I get ferocious
Turned to the black lotus, I'm only here for a moment then I'm gone
I teleport, throwing bodies on the third rail, scorched
I smell a corpse, I stomp through hell with a blazing torch
Riding a pale horse, with the pitch fork, my head full of sick thoughts
Leaving arms, ripped off, my legs are criss-crossed
I start to sniff salt, witches and dwarfs
Cut you, back and forth, horizontal, do your kung-fu
While I haunt you, and bring horror upon you
Licked my ?, and stomp you, I run through your kingdom and conquer you..

Chorus 2X

High explosives..
