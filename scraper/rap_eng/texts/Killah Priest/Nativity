[Intro: Killah Priest]
*Reading: Isaiah 9:2-7*
"For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given
And the government shall be upon his shoulder
And his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor
The Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace"

*Reading: Isaiah 9:7*
"Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end
Upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it
And to establish it with judgment and with justice
From henceforth even for ever and ever, and ever, and ever"

[Verse One: Hell Razah]
October 1st my date of birth, I came to the Earth
Mommy, knew it was worth, all the prayers in church
As she cried she had a smirk like the pain ain't hers
"It's a boy" - shouted the nurse, this the work of the Lord
Then she mumbled the Bible verse, clippin' the umbilical cord
And told her, may he be blessed, with a spiritual sword
Reborn and warn his people about the spiritual wars
In her arms, I sat warm, all the cryin' was gon'
As my pops stood beside her with a hospital gown on
Seven pounds strong when they fitted my crown on
I layed in the blanket, starrin' and thinkin'
When I awaken I'mma bomb the Synagogue of Satan
A rap song versus the Beast with ten horns

[Outro: Hell Razah]
The +Renaissance Child+ is born
And it's done, history is made, the album is recorded
We gon' do a +Sunz of Man+
