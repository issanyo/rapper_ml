[Verse 1: Killah Priest]
Priest the magnificent poet
I walk inside a Hindu Temple
Tripping while I fall and transform Into a trail of lotus
Then disappear like hocus pocus
When it comes to stretching ideas I do aerobics
So start flexing your joints
Because I won't stop till I'm done stretching my point
The art of the rhyme started in the mind
A paradigm shift sperm hardened into a spine
His spine turn into the caduceus
The two dragons begin the looping, I ride to the gaze of Anubis
The Mayan stars to turn different ways like a Rubik's
I could take a topic that's worthless
Boring eyes in the popular searches just by dropping these verses
I'm a prisoner of the moment, so when I see a pen, I go in
I start my sentence, I hit my bars, that's when it begins
Now my fossils is found in the cosmos
Link with the bones that they found in Morocco
Link with the mic that they found in the Congos
It was guarded by people wearing the ponchos
The burial plot surrounded by bronco's
Standing on hind legs, behind him was a cave
The anthropologist stood amazed
This is divine soil, the paranormal
Prime-mortal that came through a time portal
To rhyme for you, can't trace my race
From a different time and space, I was never designed from an ape
Was never a primate, I'm from a place, called the mindstate
Wait! My first nation was called the imagination
In time, we became determination
To put substance in the perception of oneness
Spinning spiral threads, creating a cosmic spider web
To catch wonders, in all planes of dimensions of matter
Counters of information and data
Balance of mental sensations we gathered
The carriers of light, through the triple stages of night
Then I blew greatness into phrases that I write
In the land of Erech, when the madness entered
Only when the Father repented and the Sabbath ended
The land of Admah where Cain explained to a scribe
What happen between him and his brother when he died
He smirk as he commanded his army to do drills in the dirt
He said, "You know what really hurts, after you departure
I really have nothing left" and by the time I'm deceased
I'll probably transform into the Angel of Death
And re-enter your atmosphere, dragging angels by their hair
Fire and brimstone raining from his spheres
Blood and crowns fallen while we sit on our horses
And I laugh as I look at my family portrait
I figure I found the first city
And knowing in their heart, they showed pity
Who want to rule the Earth with me?
The God of the Garden, the first son of Nod
The brotherhood of the marking
Detached Lamech and Tubal-cain
Kill em, the removal of the brain
The land of cannibal, the mistaken me as an animal
Now mistake me as Hannibal
Thousands of elephants impaled on the fence of Heaven
This mountain shaken the gates, I'll be a legend
He turned around, screaming "victory" to his brethren
Which turned into skeletons in seconds, he turned back
His flesh also melted in the face of the army presence
No weapon is formed

[Break: Killah Priest]
Kings die
God's live on
Planet we on

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
So don't contest who's the best lyricist
When you rhyme like from the futuristic time of period
Also you rhyme like you climbed out of a pyramid
And you shine, like you returned from a pilgrimage
Or a shrine, like the minds that designed the Book of Genesis
And mankind, made in Our images
When your message like the Epic of Gilgamesh
When your imperfection is accepted, you're limitless

[Outro: Killah Priest]
I scared myself
For eons
