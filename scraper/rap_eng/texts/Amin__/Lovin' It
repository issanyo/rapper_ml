[Hook]
I've been searchin for you baby
Do you want to get to know me
Saw you from across the room baby
Grabbed your hand and we danced all night baby
And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it
And I'm lovin it

[Verse 1:]
Took about a minute to find ya'
My footwork ?
Baby I'm jokin'
Baby I'm jokin'
Want to know about me but I put it in the open
Do you want to love anymore
Baby I just want to dance some more
My one two step
Somethin' you can't get
Got me like oh we
Girl you oh so set
My P.Y.T
Never D.I.E
Oh so seductive by your L-O-V-E
Whenever you need me just call
When ever you wanna funk I'll be like
Salt to my pepper
The bitter to my sweet
The one that I rememeber
The girl of my dreams
Its one of these nights to get this song with you
And I'm lovin every moment that I dance with you

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
I'm a bad boy
She a bad girl
I wanna know
If I can get one dance with you
All night till the mornin' inside
Now you're yearnin' for me
Cause I'm certain you love me
Look I'm broke as a joke
But I just want to know
Can we live till the end and we can just go
Shawty please don't go
Shawty please don't
Salt to my pepper
The bitter to my sweet
The one that I rememeber
The girl of my dreams
Its one of these nights to get this song with you
And I'm lovin every moment that I dance with you

[Hook]

Don't you know that I want you
Don't
Don't you know that I want you
Don't
Don't you know that I want you
Don't
Don't you know that I want you

Don't you know that I want you
Don't
Don't you know that I want you
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
Love it
Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
Love it
