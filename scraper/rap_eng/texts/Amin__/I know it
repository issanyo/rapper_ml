[Verse: 1]
Her names Prudence but that bitch is freaky
Say patience but that girl is needy
Is you livin' for the crew?
Or is you just livin'?
Girl shut up
I'm too damn busy
[Hook]
Tell me she a fan
Tell me that she love the band
Tell me she just wanna fuck
Girl, I know I know I know

Tell me he a fan
Tell me I'm the fuckin' man
Tell me that I'm fuckin' cold
Boy, I know I know I know

I know I'm weak
I know I'm weak
I know it
I know it
I know it
I know I'm weak

I know I'm weak
I know I'm weak
I know it
I know it
I know it
I know I'm weak

[Hook]
Tell me she a fan
Tell me that she love the band
Tell me she just wanna fuck
Girl, I know I know I know

Tell me he a fan
Tell me I'm the fuckin' man
Tell me that I'm fuckin' cold
Boy, I know I know I know

I know it I know it
I know it I know it
I know it I know it
I know
I know

[Outro]
