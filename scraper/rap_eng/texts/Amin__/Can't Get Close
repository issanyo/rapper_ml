[Intro]
One time for my niggas
One time
Two times for my women
Two times
One time
Said
One time for my niggas
One time
Two times for my women
Two times

[Verse 1:]
Puts on her make up just to make up
For all the feelins that she could never make up
Her little sister asks her
Why you put that all over your face
She tell her shut up worry about yourself instead of me
Puts on a print thong and a tight black dress
Then she heads to the party
Meets up with her boyfriend
They go upstairs
And he turns off the lights
He fucks her then he pass her to his friends on the right
Bout like five niggas
Violatin' his girl
Felt like she was in a dream it couldn't happen to her
Pinned down feelin' so worthless
Her body shatterin' now wonderin' what if
She could get away from this shit
If the Lord could just grant her one wish
She screams and she screams but the niggas just tell her
Shhhh
Sometimes she wanna cry my  nigga
But inside her pride says she just can't my nigga
Sometimes she wanna cry my  nigga
But inside her pride says she just can't my nigga
So she just keep it to herself
And can't get close to nobody else
I know it gets hard to cope with it
And when it all boils down you ain't alone in this

[Verse 2:]
Nah you ain't alone in this
Just a nigga who seems like he's so souless
Sticks to one lied told
Bros over hoes
Never coincides with love anymore
Truth this nigga was a loveable guy
Heartbroken by a women who just fed him lies
Bought her flowers every week
He was sprung out his mind
No he fucks dumb bitches never worry bout they feelin's
Cause he so lost in this lost world
Wants a bad bitch but a good girl
He finds a good one
He treats em like dirt
Then he wonders why he can never fall in first
Went from a young Carlton
To a young Fresh Prince
Doggin' these hoes to the bone
Wonderin' if he can ever commit
You see I'm talkin' bout me
I just can't get close anymore

Sometimes I wanna cry my nigga
But inside my pride says I'm a man my nigga
Sometimes I wanna cry my nigga
But inside my pride says I just can't my nigga
So I just keep it to myself
And can't get close to nobody else
I know it gets hard to cope my nigga
But when it all boils down
You ain't alone my nigga

[Outro]
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
I can't get close
