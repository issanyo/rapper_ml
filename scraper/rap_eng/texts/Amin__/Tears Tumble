[Verse 1: One-2]
Pacing in my room walking back and forth
As I'm gazing at the moon during night with bright
Constellations as they loom through the haze
Isolated I consume medication to alleviate my wounds
But I'm only getting worse frozen like photographs
Ain't a drug in the world that can restore my broken path
Flags that have masks visions of my mother shedding tears
As my casket gets lowered in to the grass
Heavy hearted cause close friends departed
Saw their lives abruptly end before they even barely started
Choking on the truth, in my attempt to swallow
Tried to drink away the pain feeling hollow when I'm done
I've become the empty bottle, men don't cry
And I tried to hold in, but my walls are closing in
As the clouds turn gray above the mountain peaks
The rain falls, teardrops tumble down my cheek

[Hook: Tena Jones]
I just can't stop these tears from falling from my eyes
It's like the rigid wall keep protectin' my mind with me
Tears tumble
I can't fake it and I hate it
Tears tumble
I'm praying, I'm gone make it

[Verse 2: Amin]
Ayo, It's really like a maze dog
If you get stuck in a phase and wanna take all
A piece of reality had to break off
Leaving my box and cut the chains off
See man I drop all of this pain dog
Heart's mechanical, I rev up the chain saw
Life's a risk I give and take all
Corner of the pocket gets struck by the 8 ball
And I'm talking bills not Billiard
I tried to sit still quiet tried to think to God
But my mind is like a riot in a prison yard
Three-floor complex with the prison guard
3,4,5 sets pushing off the floor
People tell me the end is the light
It's dim but I might get in cause I'm bright
I live through the fight, and work through the pain
Build with the struggle til it turns into knowledge in my brain

[Hook: Tena Jones]
I just can't stop these tears from falling from my eyes
It's like the rigid wall keep protectin' my mind With me
Tears tumble
I can't fake it and I hate it
Tears tumble
I'm praying, I'm gone make it

[Verse 3: One-2]
Through the pain I've endured, feelings dazed and detoured
I tried to remain grounded getting faded off herb
Mind clouded wishin' I could fly away like a bird
I can't sleep I'm the black sheep who's straight from the herd
Disturbed nightmares feelin' cold I break sweat
Soakin' walking tight rope without a safety net
I'm copin' with regrets hands covered in dirt
Wishin' I could mend the hearts of loved ones that I hurt
But I ain't asking for forgiveness just pray that you understand
I'm basically just a man, one day I'll be that person you're able to trust again
Cause lord knows how lonely my world's become since the day that your doors closed
Dear ???, I can't even express how much I miss ya wishin I was up there wit ya
Man I start choking up every time I hug your sister
So I shed a tear for you as I provide a little liquor

[Hook: Tena Jones]
I just can't stop these tears from falling from my eyes
It's like the rigid wall keep protectin' my mind With me
Tears tumble
I can't fake it and I hate it
Tears tumble
I'm praying, I'm gone make it
