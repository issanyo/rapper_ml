[Verse: Denzel Washington]
The point is
The point is
Every graduate here today has the training and the talent to succeed
But do you have guts to fail?
Here’s my second point about failure
If you don’t fail
You're not even trying
I'll say it again
If you don’t fail
You're not even trying
My wife told me this great expression
To get something you never had
You have to do something you never did
Les Brown, a motivational speaker, made an analogy about this

Imagine you’re on your deathbed—and standing around your bed
Are the ghosts representing your unfilled potential
The ghosts of the ideas you never acted on
The ghosts of the talents you didn’t use
And they’re standing around your bed
Angry. Disappointed. Upset
They say
We came to you because you could have brought us to life
They say
And now we go to the grave together
So I ask you today
How many ghosts are going to be around your bed when your time comes?

[Outro: Aminé]
