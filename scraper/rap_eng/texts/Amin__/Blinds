[Verse 1]
Every day I'm counting up my paper
Petty niggas hate, the ones in public with the vapors
Leave 'em in the dust and then we tell 'em see you later
Only people that truly know me is my mama and my maker
Shawty, you like my freeform dreads
I love it when she give a nigga freeform head
It's the banana boy, favorite color you know
Yellow is the new black, and I'm Mr. Caputo

[Chorus]
Close the blinds
I want to see me shine
Don't want to hear you chime
I want to see me glisten
Close the blinds
I want to see me shine
Don't want to hear you chime
I want to see me glisten

[Verse 2]
Dreads like Bob Marley, hardly ever call these hoes
I'm too gnarly, look like George Foreman
Couldn't afford Jordan's, talk to informant, never
I'm important, maybe I might die
Baby girl, I'm the cream of the crop (yeah)
Creme de la creme, got the juice so they jock (true)
Women in my city treat a nigga like I'm Diddy
Pimpin' ain't a thang, I'm independent with my lane (ay!)
Aminé very fly (yeah), Aminé don't even try (no)
He raps and then he dips, he never singin' for no tricks (yeah)
Turn on your TV, then you might see me
Aminé don't give a fuck because I know that I'm the G
