[Hook]
She talk to me
Oh she talk to me now
She talk to me
Oh she talk to me
Oh she talk to me now
She talk to me now
She talk to me now now
She walk to me now
She walk to me now now
And now you wanna' be
Where I wanna' be
Funny how Adam always wanna trust
And now you wanna be
Where I wanna be
And now your on your knees
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
I said oh the irony
I said oh the irony

[Verse 1:]
I gave you all my love
You told me that
I couldn't fuck
Now you want me to yearn
Ain't it funny how the tables turn
Love is just a pity game
Somethin' I don't like to play
I hit a few or two
Maybe you can calculate
Now you in my room
On your knees
On my daddy long
Baby I'm a nigga
And a nigga gone do what he wants
Either your momma love me even your cousins too
But you went and dropped me for some other dude
You know me
Me no way
And when you on your knees
This is what I say

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
You like my style
You like my song
You say NÃ© you the fuckin' bomb
The fact is
You too plastic
And I don't wanna love nobody average
Mr. Bombastic
Mr. Fantastic
Mrs. I done tried to love you but you too selfish
I cut you right
Like I never left
That's probably why I'm gettin this shit off my chest

[Hook]
