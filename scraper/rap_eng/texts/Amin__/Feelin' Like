[Hook]
It's feelin' like a summer night
Will I get it right
Just waitin' outside
Of your house
Fuck these cat and mouse
Just trynna lift your blouse
Maybe get inside your house
It's feelin' like one of those nights
I want you by my side
Why can't you get it right
I'm tired of
All these ups and downs
Come inside my house
Maybe we can work it out

[Verse 1:]
I'm tired of all these games
I wanna know what I gotta do
Your momma and your brother interupt everytime I try to fuck
Uh oh
Time is wastin'
Let me through the back maybe the basement
Legs in the air bout' to hit this kitty cat
And I never really front so I hit it from the back
Then your daddy walks in
And I'm like oh shit
Pull my fuckin' pants up while I ran out that bitch like
Every time I love you
And every time I fuck you
It's like a retrograde
Love never works out anyways

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I'm tired of everything
I'm feelin' like this is not meant to be
I want to know if you can demonstrate
How you love who I am baby boy
Love me for me
Look in my eyes what do you see
A woman who ain't of cooking
And 24/7 I love the way you lookin'
Baby you know I wanna' fuck you but time is so wrong
Shit I really love you but between you and me it gets over short
Like every time I love you
Every time I fuck you
It's like a retrograde
Love never works out anyways
