[Pre-Hook: Aminé]
Attitude like "what you lookin' at?"
My face look like "I don't wanna chat"
My wrist look clean, and it's mean, it's mean
Your party look lame, I'ma have to pass

[Hook: Aminé]
'Cause I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh ('Cause my drip too clean!)

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I'm starin' at the window of this Buick (yuh!)
Hoes say I'm heroic but I told her I'm historic (hey!)
Bitch, ya boy a Borat and a Boris mixed with Maury (true!)
I'm out here with Topanga like I'm white and my name Cory
(Woo!) Scene! That's the end of the movie
Looks like you a lame old goofy
We don't ever love thots or the groupies
That's word to my OG Boosie
Independent like my first name Webbie
I look clean, I don't ever look messy
Goddammit, I know I'm sexy, Goddammit-

[Pre-Hook: Aminé]
Attitude like "what you lookin' at?"
My face look like "I don't wanna chat"
My wrist look clean, and it's mean, it's mean

[Hook: Aminé]
'Cause I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh ('Cause my drip too clean!)

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Bitch I'm fresh as hell, these Amiri’s now
Mike Amiri DM’d me on the ‘Gram
Told me do the Amiri challenge
Mixin’ Amiri jeans and jacket with the Guwop shirt
That’s the Amiri balance
Say I'm gettin' money, you accurate
You don't ever see me ridin' no Acura
This a Hellcat, 700 horsepower on that bitch
You can't hear me slide
Bitch, I'm hot, what's happenin'?
Gelato and Percocets one of my habits
Shit, if it shine, I'm buyin', 200, 300k for my diamonds
Ain't talkin' shit, I'm a savage
Reach for this bitch, I'm blastin' (bow!)

[Pre-Hook: Aminé]
Attitude like "what you lookin' at?"

[Hook: Aminé]
'Cause I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh, ('Cause my drip too clean!)

[Interlude: Rickey Thompson]
You see me doin' shit, bitch, and I've got you shook!

[Verse 3: Aminé and Rickey Thompson]
Ooh, I got you shook bitch, I know you wanna look bitch
My drip got your bitch like (Oh my gosh!)
This that "in my bag shit," "never look at tags" shit
This dick make your shawty say (Oh my gosh!)
In LA like my name Dre
Hit Gabe up for a fade
My jewels is custom made, but I didn't go to Kay
I'm whippin' right down Pico
I'm nasty like I'm Rico
I'm skrtin' through the bullshit
I Swervo like I'm Herbo

[Hook: Aminé]
Cause I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh (swerve)
I told that bitch I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh (swerve)
I told that bitch I'm fresh, I'm fresh in the flesh
I told that bitch I'm fresh (Cause my drip too-)

[Outro]
Oh shit, my bad
Umm, alright, next song
