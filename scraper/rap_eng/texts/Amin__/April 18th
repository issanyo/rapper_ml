[Prod. By Jahosh]

[Intro]
Just turned twenty, twenty
Like Diane Sawyer

[Verse: 1]
Just turned veinte
Trying to get bigger than a venti
Trying to get the bucks of a star
My latin girl said I need to stack plenty
Jahosh playing prophets trying to get some profit
These dumb things give a nigga a lot of knowledge
Wallet looking thinner than Conan O'brien
But this atom finna blow like I was in science
Look baby I don't do love
Matter fact shawty I don't even do hugs
You ask a nigga why and I say just because
You get too attached and then you blame it on some love
Like I said who you know like me?
Né prolly need a Blake Lively
Né, Né prolly need a new new
See I've been feeling Gucci while they looking Fubu

[Verse: 2]
Never claim you the realest in the room
Cause if you ain't nigga it'll show like
A flower when it blooms
Or a tower when it falls
Or a chick that say she virgin but she always on her back with no drawers
Shawty said I'm too young for her
I told her "Baby I just turned twenty"
Let me hit it
Now I'm done with her
Now I'm done with her
I've been on the go
And she just wants some more
Tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
I've been on the go
Trying to get it quicker in a nigga Sono
If you ain't with it Shawty I may have to go
But your wah gwaan to a bad man I don't know
I just turned veinte
Feeling bigger than a venti
Trying to get the bucks of a star
My latin girl said I need to stack plenty
