[Hook]
Rollin' through my city like 3:45
Got a text from a bad chick with a rise
Said she from the valley and she live in the hills
Now shawty wanna ride cause she livin for the thrill
[Verse 1:]
Rollin' through my city like 3:45
Shawty wanna act like she don't know the kid
Man that hoe frame
Bitch know what it is

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I said wagwaan
Oh wagwaan
Shawty you done hit my phone like twice now
Can you tell a nigga what you really really want
Oh singin'
Rollin through my city like 3:45
Got a young thing
She a freak in disguise
Go vroom vroom
Less she give me poom poom
Libyanese chick and I love her couscous
Baby you know it's my baby
I just wanna love you cause that ass outrageous
Rage out like Ray J
Baby sometimes cause these women love to front
But I don't know why
I don't know why
Why why

Them cats had to do the damn thing on they rise
Ride ride when you wanna ride
Cause baby you my baby and it's 3:45
So so so so
