[Pre-hook]
I was, down
But I'm really lit right now
A couple drinks in your head
Your calling me daddy instead
Mommy how that dress fit tight
Is it heaven between your thighs
She wanna know what's my name
Lil mama look you can call me

[Hook]
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Not your daddy, or your father, or your papa
Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
Baby you can call me Baba
African so I can hit it proper

[Verse 1]
My stroke game good, check this
He buy you nice things girl that's reckless
I'd rather give ya my password to Netflix
Look
I know I'm a black boy, brown skin
White girl think I taste like chocolate
Hm, maybe you should come try a lick, shit
Badder then average
Shawty's a savage
Face from the heavens with a ass on Dallas
And her first name lavish
Material girl like Gucci and Prada
I used to rock Fubu and Dada
Two different types of people
But I know we equal
If you give me one chance I don't need a sequel
Singin'
Your body's like a temple to me
If feels like tetherball's in the sky
Soaring free from the worlds fallacies
One hit is all you need to fly

[Verse 2]
I reside in the 503, it's the west side nigga
Shawty say she only date dude with whips, when she ride the bus, how that make sense?
I try to give you everything
Gold diggers we no wife'm we no give them wedding rings like
I wanna know you
You wanna know me
We busy as fuck so we in and we out
No time for us now
Material girl like Gucci and Prada
I used to rock Fubu and Dada
Two different types of people
But I know we equal
If you give me one chance I don't need a sequel
Singin'
Your body's like a temple to me
If feels like tetherball's in the sky
Soaring free from the worlds fallacies
One hit is all you need to fly

[Amharic Outro]
You are beautiful, I am Baba how are you
Where'd you come from girl, oh my oh my
Wow girl you became
You are beautiful, I am Baba how are you
Where'd you come from girl, oh my oh my
Wow girl you became
