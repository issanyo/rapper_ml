[Intro]
Yah-yah, yah-yah, yah, yah
Yah-yah, yah-yah, yah, yah
Woah, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday I wake up
Gotta get this cake up
Lookin' at my life like
Is this what it's made of? (made of)
Money rule the world around me
That's why it's on my mind
Everyday I wake up
Gotta get this cake up
Lookin' at my life like
Is this what it's made of? (made of)
Money rule the world around me
And now I realize...

[Chorus]
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life

[Verse 1]
Tender love and care, I see the money with my left eye
Rubber band man like my nickname T.I
Labels wanna sign but the money so eh
And the contract iffy so Brookah tell 'em see ya
I'm most loyal to the most loyal
You can't find dirt on me 'cause I'm not soil
I wouldn't do much for money man (yeah)
Aminé ain't Juwanna Man
Not at all, women makin' calls
Like "Aminé, do you got that paper? Let me hold it"
Mama need a whip and my daddy need a crib
Got a phone, lil nigga, why the fuck I need a Rollie?
Black pepper chicken and chow mein, my favorite
Sayin' you ain't racist really sounds racist
See money give a nigga rings
Then when you get it everybody call you fake

[Bridge 1]
'Cause when it all boils down
Everything's a riddle
Everything's fickle
There's no satisfaction
There's no satisfaction
Cause when it all boils down
Everything's fickle
And little
There's no satisfaction
There's no

[Pre-Chorus]
Every day I wake up
Gotta get this cake up
Lookin' at my life like, is this what it's made of? (Made of)
Money rule the world around me
That's why it's on my mind
Every day I wake up
Gotta get this cake up
Lookin' at my life like, is this what it's made of? (Made of)
Money rule the world around me
And now I realize

[Chorus]
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life

[Verse 2]
My city never thought it'd make a nigga like me
Young lil' nigga from the 503
I'm Tom Cruise, the rap game the couch from Oprah
I'm here for my range, boy, not them Rovers
Money make my world go 'round
Money make my heartbeat pounce
Ask God for a lot
Success ain't 'bout the fame and how much jewels you rock
Success is when I can tell my mama to quit her job
Still poppin' Pellegrino 'cause my mama like my hero
Now hoes give me head cause I make banana bread
Young black boy, mi ah world so rude
Give me 40 acres with a Moscow Mule
My Señorita boricua
She smoke a lot of the reefer
I need me commas on commas if rappers want him on feature
I'm making Swiss beats so I beat it like an Alicia
Money don't make you happy, it just makes you wanna get richer

[Bridge 2]
'Cause when it all boils down
The paper bring me pleasure
There's no satisfaction
There's no satisfaction
There's nothing you can do to give me
What I really need (There's no satisfaction)
What I really need

[Chorus]
Money make the world go 'round
Money turn your best friend down
Money turn a good girl out
Money make the sun go south
And it make my self-esteem
But it never take my dream life
