[Intro]
Lost in a plastic life
Say she don't really love no one
Lost in a plastic life
And she pop champagne all night like


[Verse 1]
Lost in a plastic life
Dropped out of school the first night like
And her parents don't know
Refund checks for her manicures like
Cigarette smoke while she choke
Chugs that fifth and she work at sacks 5th
Six inch heels and a pole
Strips on the side just to get by
Ohhh
Tears runnin' down ya face
Can ya tell me why?
Ohhh
Rent is due but ya copped jimmy chu's
Can ya tell me why?
Ohhh
Ya know ya too drastic
And ya know this life plastic
It's righteous
And ya might just
Break
DOWN


[Chorus]
Hollywood lights
Pop champagne
Plastic life
So she want that fame
Rollie on
Diamond rangs
All them likes
So he like that fame
Gucci, Fendi, Prada, no fake
Lost in the plastic life they really hate


[Verse 2]
Lost in a drastic life
He takin' pics of his cash like
I mean flexin' is a right
But homie you know that's yo rent like
TURNUP
That's his favorite phrase
Spent his check on the liquor takin' it straight
GROWUP
Maybe one day
But all he really want
Is the money and the fame
He like 30 with a Jersey
Why ya so throwback
He got a gold chain but he a no name
Why ya gotta do that
Ohhh
Ya know ya too drastic and ya know this life plastic
It's righteous
And ya might just
Break
DOWN

[Chorus]
Hollywood lights
Pop champagne
Plastic life
So she want that fame
Rollie on
Diamond rangs
All them likes
So he like that fame
Gucci, Fendi, Prada, no fake
Lost in the plastic life they really hate
