[Verse 1: Robin Kim]
You took me swimming drunk in band
Beneath the milky way we slept
Your folks don't have to know that we've got whiskey breath

[Hook]
And I'm staring at your eyes like
I'm thinkin' I knew you from my past life
And I'm staring at your eyes like
And girl you light me up like a night light

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Told me you love me today
Beneath the river where my heart lays
My mother riddled me that wisemen make mistakes

[Hook]
And I'm staring at your eyes like
I'm thinkin' I knew you from my past life
And I'm staring at your eyes like
And girl you light me up like a night light

[Verse 3:]
How deep is the ocean
I don't care at all
Six miles if you count em'

[Hook]
And I'm staring at your eyes like
I'm thinkin' I knew you from my past life
And I'm staring at your eyes like
And girl you light me up like a night light

[Verse 4: Robin Kim]
You taught me how to smoke all wrong
I saw a ghost from church years past
My parents still don't know I was scared to death

[Verse 5: Aminé]
Unholy thoughts parading in mind
I see you grin which makes me smile
When will you realize that
One day you'll be mine

[Verse 6:]
Floating around our backs turn red
We lick our rainbow covered cones
Then we zipped up to sleep in our respective beds

[Outro]
Ask me how deep the ocean is
Why should I?
Come on just ask me
Why?
Because I know the answer
Oh do you?
Yeah I do
How deep is the ocean?
I'm not gonna say
I'm brokenhearted
The ocean is six miles deep
Good
