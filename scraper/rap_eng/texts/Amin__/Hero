[Intro: Aminé]
Ayo, A-Mine
Animé
Anemone
Amani for one
Animé, right?
Ayo Amen, ayy you make music, innit?
Don't you have that one song that's on YouTube? It's like...
Aminaminah
Amino, right?
Something, I don't know...
I Aminé no harm
Nah? Oh... oh... my bad

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Respect, that's all I ask for
My feelings feel too
No you ain't stone cold
I know you bleed too
Head up in the clouds
My feet to the crowd
I hate all your friends
But y'all splittin' rent
So every night I'm over
I try to find some closure
But you open your jaws
And then I'm goin' raw

[Refrain: Aminé]
I wanna throw my hands up high
And forget who I used to be
I wanna throw my hands up high
And get a taste of your luxury

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé & Girlpool]
You don't wanna cry tears with me (tears)
You just wanna keep sighin' (sighin')
Sometimes I wonder if you're bad for me (you're bad)
But that's what keeps me excited
When I'm with you

[Chorus: Aminé]
You're my hero
And my heroin
I'm addicted
Ms. Excellent (ayy)
You're my hero (hero)
And my heroin (yuh)
Oh you're perfect (I love it)
But you're bad for me

[Verse 2: Aminé]
She gave me an addy
Couldn't hit the J (J)
I hate all your habits
Price I gotta pay (pay)
Tastes like smoke but her lungs never choke (no)
Oh heart, brain freeze, oh I like her, baby
I hate you (uh) but I love you
I always pay you (yeah) but I owe you (true)
I mean I CashApp to you, I Venmo too (hey)
My savings ain't been saving so let's IOU (woo)
I paid for dinner and dessert (I did)
Keep my attention on your eyes (I did)
Open my heart and open doors (school)
But respect seems to lack from you

[Refrain: Aminé]
I wanna throw my hands up high
And forget who I used to be
I wanna throw my hands up high
And get a taste of your luxury

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé & Girlpool]
You don't wanna cry tears with me (tears)
You just wanna keep sighin' (sighin')
Sometimes I wonder if you're bad for me (you're bad)
But that's what keeps me excited
When I'm with you

[Chorus: Aminé]
You're my hero
And my heroin
I'm addicted
Ms. Excellent (ayy)
You're my hero (hero)
And my heroin (yuh)
Oh you're perfect (I love it)
But you're bad for me
