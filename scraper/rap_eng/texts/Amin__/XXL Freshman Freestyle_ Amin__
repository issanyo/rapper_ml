[Verse]
I woke up on this Sunday
With no motivation in my body, no woah woah
Phone dryer then Mojave
Daddy diabetic so he eat his pancakes with agave
Mama headed to the church now
And she left me at the house, she left me at the house
Religious but I'm lazy
Naked like a nudist, Fruity Loops and Stanley Kubrick
Peanut butter jelly, cousin bumping Makaveli
Sippin' Stellas with my fellas bumping nothin' but Fela Kuti
Groupies say they wanna do me, truly that feel like a blessing
But finding one to love is getting harder every second
Niggas'd rather be single than see a wedding day
Niggas'll either end up at heaven or Kevin's Gates
I bench press my problems, like add another weight
And act like it's alright when it's not, woah

Some days we get sun days, but most days the rain comes down
And I feel like I'm bound to drown
Jesus Christ, woah
Truth is my religion, my beliefs are not forgiven
