[Intro: Sample]
"You no-business, born-insecure, junkyard motherfucker!"

[Chorus: Aminé]
Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Campfire—I'm a hot motherfucker
Please, no pictures, I'm a tired motherfucker
Spidey senses tingle when it's fake niggas
Dreads swinging like they did the Harlem shake, nigga, that's true
West Coast 'til I d-i-e
If you want respect, look me in my e-y-e
I love my whips like a racist and travel lot of places
Free my nigga, Hef, fuck the police
Uh, Oprah for President, CLBN resident
Thizz-Face when I'm disgraced—that's the nigga in me
Might catch me at a Whole Foods
And if you see that red Mercedes, then you know who

[Chorus: Aminé]
Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch

[Verse 2: Ritchie with a T]
Yeah, yeah, campfire—I'm a scary lil' nigga
This run in my blood like Drew Barrymore, nigga
And my fit on ET, yo 'shit on EBT
So when you try to flex, I'm like, "What's yo' credit score, nigga?"
Yeah, and that's word to my granny
Since 14, knew the route like Randy
Everything dandy, gray sweats with the Pennys
Nausea, heartburn, side effects may vary
Yeah, fuck these niggas, where the child lock?
So many hits, I could have my own NOW! comp
Pen a triple album full of all my children
No difference from Kidz Bop, book 'em in the Hilton

[Chorus: Aminé]
Got a bad lil' mama, and she always with the shits
Put a hundred in my pocket, then a hundred on the rims
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
Put a red dress on her and some gas for the trip
Got a hundred in my pocket and a couple on the tint
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
That's my lil' bitch—that's—that's my lil' bitch
