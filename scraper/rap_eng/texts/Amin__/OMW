[Verse 1:]
I'm from the west
She from the east
Columbiana
Said she like my beats
Said she from the heights
She tell me what she like
I tell her what I want
She said me up tonight
She tired of her man
Does he please her
No way
She said be here in 10
So I'm on my way

[Hook]
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
I'm on my way
From the mornin' to the evenin'
Girl I know you need it
Girl I know you're fiendin'
So I'm on my way
Anytime you sees it
Girl I know you need it
Girl I know you're fiendin'
So I'm on my way

[Verse 2:]
My poetry
Too potent for pussies to be
I roll it deep
We livin we livin you see
She hit me up
She tell me she need it
She need it
I tell her okay
Give me a minute
Whether a bus or a bike
A scooter or hike
I travel like a mile for the pussy
I run inside of your crib
Take you down like we in spaceship
My wordplay play
But my words okay
A young mothafucka who don't play no games
I'mma talk like I am the shit
But really I don't think these niggas understand
Shawty I know you need me
Oh I said shawty I know you need me
I know your man don't treat you right
So just call me if you need me so

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Late night texts like shawty what's up
She said I'm gettin' lonely
And I need someone to hold me so

[Hook]

[Outro]
She fiendin'
She want it
She need it
She horny
She fiendin'
She want it
She need it
She horny
