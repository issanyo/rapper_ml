[Prod. By Jahosh]

[Intro]
You see every heart breaks breaks when it wants to
And when you break that heart
That heart never wants to
Love again
So she singin'

[Hook]
Why can't you want me like the other boys do?
They stare at me while I stare at you
Why can't I keep you safe as my own?
One moment I have you the next you are gone

[Verse: 1]
You wonder why I'm so selfish
And why I never reply to your texts
Is it because I'm still attached to my exes
Girl you're fine but you're so damn restless
And she got an axe with a fat ass
She kill a nigga quicker anytime that she can
I wanna to be alone
She wanna be a hoe
You broke my heart in seconds
And now you want it when I'm gone
I tell her like
Baby you the bombest
You can get it
But I don't want it (I don't want it)
So now you singing

[Hook]

[Verse: 2]
Attention, Attention
That's what every girl and they momma wanna mention
Girl you're so fine, girl you're so fine
But, I'd never tell you that cause I never wanna sweat ya
Pop it with the pop again
And pop it if you want to pop it
Thinking every bop in a nigga
Popular is your only goal
I tell her what I need when I want
And if you really want me shawty
We can get it on
Baby you the bombest
You can get it
But I don't want it
So now you singing
[Hook]
