[Hook]
When I'm sad I wanna
And when I'm mad I wanna
When I'm stressed I wanna
Put the liquor to my face and
Party
Party
Party
Party
Party

[Verse 1:]
Usually this isn't me
See the devil creep before my feet
A lot of stress on me right now
So I said fuck it I'll move down
My lifestyle really to busy to enjoy
A lot of people putting pressure on me to be the boy
Wanna ask for shit
Wanna nag for shit
You gotta realize boy
You ain't entitled to shit
Gotta work hard just to play harder
Learned that from my nigga Dre at a dundada
Shots of patron got me so louder
Got 14 bitches man they gettin' devoured
Always on a flight just to head to New York
It's the big city
Where rich means broke
So I grind my ass off
Just to hope for some hope
Gamble with my life just to see what I've wrote

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
Liquor in my soul now
Bitches on the floor now
Feelin' like I don't care
Hand me another drink now
The pain the pain
All in my veins
Got me feelin' like I am insane
Shawty bust it open for a nigga
So I'm feelin' like I wanna
Get a table for my peacoat
Set it over there so I can get my fuckin' freak on
Party to the mornin'
Forget about that weak pishpause
Maybe get my dick sucked
Tonight I'm feelin' like the opposite of Oliver Tate
Tonight I'm feelin' like the opposite of Oliver Tate
