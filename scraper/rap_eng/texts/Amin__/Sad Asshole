[Verse]
Smile on my face but I’m dim
Head heavy like Tim
Eyes point down at my chin
Don’t know how to fix it
Had the Nissan with the rims
Thought I was hotter than that nigga, Mims
When papa’s fries used to fill me up
You the one that I used to love

It’s past 12 am
I’m on my second wind
I keep that white light on me
‘Cause I don’t give a fuck if I die
I like chilling, she like choking, that’s the difference
When I can’t put my finger on it
I put it in it

[Chorus]
There's something different about you
There's something different about you
There's something different about you
There's something different about you
