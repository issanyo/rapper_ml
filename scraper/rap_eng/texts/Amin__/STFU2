[Intro: Rickey Thompson]
Before you talk that shit about me, how 'bout you clear your throat? I can hear you chokin' on my tenacious dick everytime your dumb ass talks shit about me. Like I said before, bitch, you're not shit, you're never gon' be shit, and you're just a piece of shit. So shut the fuck up!

[Verse]
(Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up)
Two milly in my hand, two milly for a jam
That's four milly in the can, the size of Pac's caravan
My wingspan 7 foot, right hand get a hook
Hit a lick then leave him shook, treat him just like police would
Mask on, niggas hard, mask off, niggas soft
Genius like I'm Steve Jobs, greedy like I'm Steve Jobs
Okay, you really wanna test me today
Okay, I hit em like I'm Bobby Boucher
They see me rollin' now, I'm tryna make a million
I got a new bitch, like I'm Ben Simmons
My ego big as Shaq, rockin' like Fu-Schnickens
Put it in her Ariana, like I'm Mariah's children
I smell the snake on the scene
For heaven's sake let him breathe
Pussy niggas talk shit like they really the man
And when we actually pull up you best don't front on 'em, man

[Chorus]
(Shut the fuck up) and why you whinin'?
(Shut the fuck up) aye, stop cryin'
Keep frontin' on my niggas, keep stylin'
If you sendin' threats then my niggas gon' find 'em
(Shut the fuck up) and why you whinin'?
(Shut the fuck up) aye, stop cryin'
Keep frontin' on my niggas, keep stylin'
If you sendin' threats then my niggas gon' find 'em
