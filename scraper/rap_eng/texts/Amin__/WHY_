[Intro]
Yeah
This sound like
Yeah my momma told me to close the door
I don't wanna close it no more

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wonder why
Yeah, I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why
Me I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why
She wonder why, why
I wonder why
She be wondering why, why

[Post-Chorus]
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(Keep my head down)
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(Keep my head down)
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(I'm gon' show no frowns)
Why, why, why

[Verse 1]
(Okay drop it) To the floor and I'm back
Had to relax and never relapse
Shoutout to Reese, the sex was like crack
I need love, I'm depressed, I'm a fool, I'm a mess
But my first priority is never second best
(I've been down, PCH with the fam)
I'm that nigga and I know it
(I can feel the sun hittin' on my veins)
Pupils dilated, they don't focus
(I can feel the sun hittin' on my veins)
Can't nobody ever know this, they can't know this
(Ridin' 'round ain't nobody on my brain)
Probably on some fast shit, should've done some acid
Runnin' through my last check, wish I knew some magic
Stressin' out crazy, wish I had a clone-me
Said she wanna talk, but I hope it's not a baby

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wonder why
Yeah, I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why
Me I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why
She wonder why, why
I wonder why
She be wondering why, why

[Post-Chorus]
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(Keep my head down)
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(Keep my head down)
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(I'm gon' show no frowns)
Why, why, why (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I just bought my momma a new whip, straight cash
I paid my taxes, so it hurts my racks
I hate when niggas say, "chill out", and they ain't got no chill
They let me skip the DMV line, that's when I knew it was real
I pulled up, like it goin' pretty fast
I'm the type to get the bag (Woo)
Fuck it, let's just count it fast
I don't know why I'm feeling down
I don't know no goofies, or no loose leafs
This ain't a hand out, don't take no cookies
Hey look I'm stressed out, I'm straight from movies
But this is real life, so let's just, you know what, fuck it

[Chorus]
Ohh, I wonder why
Yeah, I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why
Me I wonder why, why
Yeah, I wonder why
She wonder why, why
I wonder why
She be wondering why, why

[Post-Chorus]
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(Keep my head down)
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(Keep my head down)
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why
(I'm gon' show no frowns)
Why, why, why (Why)

[Outro]
Running out of breath
Everytime we fuck
The sex is amazing
But it feels like a rush
Iâ€™m running out of breath
Everytime we fuck
The sex is amazing
But it feels like a rush (rush)
