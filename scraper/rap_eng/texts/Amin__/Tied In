[Intro: Amine]
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Amine]
Tied in with niggas, you tied in with bitches
You tied in them lies with these prime time niggas
Selfies with your bestie, and the media got you feeling testy
You know I'm young, and I'm restless
I got to much on my mind for some bullshit
I got a lot to do, and I got a lot to say
I got a lot to prove, and I like myself today
Wide open, in the open
Lights closed in, in the world in
I said too much on my mind (Yeah, yeah)
And this is how I feel all the time

[Chorus: Amine]
Go see the world, tell all the boys
Don't need faith, wanna get us
Tryna hold you down, but you just wanna stop
Stuck on the money, but you just want a boy
You're tied in, but your mind's out
Tied in, but your mind's out
Tied in, but your mind's out
You stuck on the money, but you just want more

[Bridge: MUNA & Amine]
Hey, yeah (More, more, more)
Hey, yeah, hey yeah (More, more, more)
Hey yeah (More, more, more)
Hey yeah, yeah yeah (More, more, more)
Hey yeah (Listen up her)
Hey, yeah, hey yeah (Listen to him)
Hey yeah (Listen to her)
Hey yeah, yeah yeah (Listen to him)
But she might tell (La la la la, la)
She might tell (La la la la, la)
She might tell (La la la la, la)
Wait up now (La la la la, la)
Tightening my grip (La la la la, la)
And I can't have it (La la la la, la)
So it get heavy(La la la la, la)
It gets

[Chorus: Amine & MUNA]
Go see the world, tell all the boys
Don't need faith, wanna get us
Tryna hold you down, but you just wanna stop
Stuck on the money, but you just want more
You're tied in, but your mind's out
Tied in, but your mind's out
Tied in, but your mind's out
You stuck on the money, but you just want more
Go see the world, tell all the boys (But she might tell)
Don't need faith, wanna get us (She might tell)
Tryna hold you down, but you just wanna stop (She might tell)
Stuck on the money, but you just want more (Wait up now)
You're tied in, but your mind's out (Tightening my grip)
Tied in, but your mind's out (I can't have it)
Tied in, but your mind's out (I can't)
You stuck on the money, but you just want more
