[Hook]
Shawty wanna ride in my spaceship now
Said she likes my whip
And she like my style
Shawty wanna ride in my spaceship now
If she gettin' tired I'mma take that down
Take that down
If she gettin' tired I'mma take that down

[Verse 1:]
Senorita called bout like 8 PM
Asked me about my whip and my spaceship
And she said does it go
Rooooom like a jet
I said hella naw girl it go shoooom like a ship
If she like the way I talk
Probably like the way I walk
If she wanna fuck tonight bet I use a rubber
I just want to hit the lights
She just wants to get inside
I'm just tryna give her dick tonight
Charm on my arm
She just love my demeanor
She says
I'm just just gone to the morn
She just twerk it
Twerk it
Twerk it for a don
What's the reason
For your tease on
I just wanna take you to mars
You know I don't play no games
You know I don't show no shame
If you playin' with me to the left like Beyonc√©

[Hook]

Now shawty
I wanna ride on the milky way
With me
I think I know why she wants to
So she rides upon me
And then she lies to you
She tells me back harder harder
You know I've been looking for the one
YOu know I just want the above
You don't want what I want
Cause I'm done for whatever
Fly by Mars and we flyin' by Pluto
This that song we play while we foolin'
I take you down
No time for coolin'
Fuck then I pull us up on neutral

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Take you down
I take you down
Take you down
Take you down
