[Intro:]
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me

[Hook:]
Why would I try when I know it's all a lie
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Status of names ya followers and chains
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Turnin' up when the world is corrupt
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Ple-ease somebody save me


[Verse 1:]
Welcome to America the land of the weak
Where everybody tweets but don't know how to speak
Gimmicks are acceptable when it's on a dope beat
And people wanna beleive almost everything they see
Rappers know they verse KAPOOT
But they do it for the LOOT
They do it for the chain
And they do it for the coup
I mean
How can I blame ya
Ya hustlin' dawg
But if ya hustle
Keep ya muscle
Please don't soften up dawg
I morn for the norm
Cus' the morals ain't normal
These women half naked but they treat them like they royal
Blue 10's instead of payin' his rent
Out comes the outcome of foolish regret


[Hook:]
Why would I try when I know it's all a lie
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Status of names ya followers and chains
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Turnin' up when the world is corrupt
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Ple-ease somebody save me


[Verse 2:]
500 dollars for a WorldStar video
No standard for the fuckin culture
Why would mad lib care about yo ad-libs
Shit
Every nigga rappin' now, every bitch a model now
Hip-hop gettin' lost in it's thots
The booty shots bigger now
Make these hoes thicker now
Hollywood done turned to Hollyhood
Bitch
Twerkn' ain't a dance you just shakin' yo ass
I can't believe you believe what the media perceives
A couple big words now you think he got degrees
A little drug talk and now you think he sellin' keys
Shit Might as well teach ya bout the birds and the bees

[Hook:]
Why would I try when I know it's all a lie
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Status of names ya followers and chains
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Turnin' up when the world is corrupt
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Ple-ease somebody save me


[Hook:]
Mr. Me too
Misses me too
Chasing all the things that ya didn't need to
Mr.  Me to
Misses me to
Burnin' every bridge that you didn't need to
And now ya want
Everything
And now ya want
All the chains
And now ya want
All the fame
And now ya lost
In the game


[Transition Verse 3:]
Flickin' pens
Since the age of 10
They told me
Diaries were not made for men
I was tryna
Make mends cus
I hate to sin
Lord forgive my pleasure gimme pain if sin again
I-E-ya
Couldn't piece
Everything together
Needed peace
So I pieced it on a piece paper
Paying dues revenue mean everything
And if ya bus it home you ain't getting wedding ring
They sayin'
4.0 's and GPA's
Means ya whole life but it cost you a price
To what degree does your degree mean
Professors tellin ya that this is what you really need

So I stroll to class
In these soles of mine
Probably owe this school like 9 souls of mine
Sucked the whole regime but she thinkin' she a dime
This just a nickel of it baby you just border line

How can I leave rap alone
That's the only chick that I really cheat with
Word to my mother
And word to the paper
And word to the pen that began everything
Oh
How can I leave rap alone
That's the only chick that I really cheat with
Word to my brother
And word to the paper
And word to the pen that began everything
How can I leave rap Rap
Rap
How can I leave rap alone that's the only chick that I really cheat with

Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
