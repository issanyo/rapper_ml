[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
Big baller, boujee shot caller
No fuck boys allowed in my aura
Missus wanna mister not for his dollar
If you're tryna flex, don't bother, 'cause I'm a
Big spender, bling on my 'genda
Last time I paid? I just can't remember
I don't have the time to play with pretenders
You might have your own but I'm the big spender

[Verse 1: Kiana Ledé]
I'm out in Hollywood, living like I should
I could have Gucci, Prada but my mama taught me good
If she had taught me something, flossing don't mean nothing
Wealth is on the inside
Well, fuck that, all the smiles come from dollars in your wallet
Bet I can make you smile without a dollar in your pocket
And a little bit of talk, and a little bit of walk, put that right there and call it
I oughta let you know
Think you should leave with me, yeah
Don't give a fuck about your currency
Don't need a baller or a Hercules
'Cause blowing trees is all I need

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
I don't want a big baller, boujee shot caller
No fuck boys allowed in my aura
Missus wanna mister not for his dollar
If you're tryna flex, don't bother, 'cause I'm a
Big spender, bling on my 'genda
Last time I paid? I just can't remember
I don't have the time to play with pretenders
You might have your own but I'm the big spender

[Verse 2: Prince Charlez]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I can't think of nothing else but loving you
You got me doing things I never really do
Tell me where you wanna go, I'm thinking Paris
I'ma give you something you gon' wanna cherish
And I ain't perfect, I know I've hurt you
But let's reverse it, it never was on purpose
You got right to my heart and it took a lot of work
'Cause know that I've been searching, baby

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé & Prince Charlez]
Big baller, boujee shot caller
No fuck boys allowed in my aura
Missus wanna mister not for his dollar
If you're tryna flex, don't bother, 'cause I'm a
Big spender, bling on my 'genda
Last time I paid? I just can't remember
I don't have the time to play with pretenders
You might have your own but I'm the big spender

[Bridge: Kiana Ledé]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, oh, a big spender, baby
Haha, that's right, big, big spender
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus: Kiana Ledé]
Big baller, boujee shot caller
No fuck boys allowed in my aura
Missus wanna mister not for his dollar
If you're tryna flex, don't bother, 'cause I'm a
Big spender, bling on my 'genda
Last time I paid? I just can't remember
I don't have the time to play with pretenders
You might have your own but I'm the big spender

[Outro: Kiana Ledé]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, baby, I'm a big spender, yeah, yeah, no, no
You don't own me, baby
