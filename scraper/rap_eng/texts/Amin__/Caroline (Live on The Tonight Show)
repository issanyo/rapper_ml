[Verse 1]
Bad thang, fine as hell, thick as...
Oh my god, that's my baby
Caroline, you divine
Mighty fine
Shawty really blow the...
Like a pro
Holy... I'm really lit
It's looking like it's 'bout time to mess it up
Caroline, listen up, don't wanna hear
About ya horoscope or what the future holds
Shut up and shut up and
Let's get gory, like a Tarantino movie
Don't wanna talk it out, can we love it out?
Cause you gon' be up all night, miss a decaf
You say I'm a tall thug, guess I'm a G-raffe
If ya want safe-sex, baby use the knee pads
Freaky with the sticky icky
Baby give me kitty kitty
Killa, westside illa
Boy you like 98 degrees
And I'm 300... keep ya feet runnin'
I chief keef keef when I eat these beats
Better boy get scurred
Don't run up in my lane, I don't want you in my lane
You a lame, get swerved

[Chorus]
'Cause great scenes might be great

[Outro]
9/11, a day that we're never forgettin'
11/9, a day that we're all regrettin'
If my president is Trump then it's relevant enough
To talk 'bout it on TV and not give a...
I'm Black, and I'm proud
My skin is brown and I'm loud
Everybody love it when a rapper tells some lies

America wanna act all happy and holy
But deep down inside they're like Brad and Jolie
Caroline divine and I won't get specific
Club Banana the illest and it's too terrific
You can never make America great again
All you ever did was make this country hate again
