[Verse 1]
Ring the alarm
Hot ass nigga
Big ass head
So my dreams get bigger
Me campaign strong
So my flows get sicker
Confidence bigger then a drunk ass nigga, look
Mama work graveyard shifts
5 to 9, not a 9 to 5
Shit, she might end up in a graveyard quick
She dead inside but she gotta provide
But, her father got a brand new kidney
While I'm out here hanging wit' Whitney
I'm guilty, need whiskey
Plus she a stuck up chick like Whitley
Look, so many paths
Don't know which one
Peter picked a pepper but I can't pick one
Niggas get grown but they minds so young
So me cyant fuck witcha but me cyant go run

[Hook]
I just wanna run away
I'm feelin' like I'm in a maze
I'm trapped in, I'm wilin' out
I'm tryna find me a bigger route, say
I just wanna run away
I'm feelin' like I'm in a maze
The same old things like everyday
I'm gettin' tired of everything, say

[Post-Hook]
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
I'm (Runnin')
Ah I'm (Runnin')
Ah I'm (Runnin')
I'm
I'm
Ah I'm (Runnin')
Ah I'm (Runnin')
I'm
I'm

[Verse 2]
Westside till I mothafuckin' die
Kevin got me flowin like I just got baptized
Runnin' through the money ya money is all lies
Matter for your matter, don't matter,  we all die
Grandfather told me things that I'll never forget
Told me fame and honor ain't bigger than respect
It's funny we don't honor the honest we all lie
Pinocchio niggas your noses is all nine
Inches, something like my dick is
Hate when they mention
Did ya get my mentions
Question
Do you even fuck with a nigga like me?
Will ya bump me in about 3 days?
Really, IDC
'Cause every time a nigga talk
They can't see
The bigger picture, fuck yo filter
Me cyant go run but me cyant repeat
No!
