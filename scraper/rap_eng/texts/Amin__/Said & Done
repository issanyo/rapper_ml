[Verse 1]
When the stars align
And your fate is near
Do you know who you can turn to
When you filled with fear
I look into the heavens
And ask my god
Holding back my tears, I ask if it's okay to cry
Want the white picket fence with the red door
If it's the white one, I'ma throw a fit
I mean you work so hard for this life, lord
But there be lives just hustling to live
It's a never ending search
For my balance, it's a challenge
But I try to make it work
For a lesson, I ask questions like

[Hook]
When I'm dead and gone
Will I lose everything I remember
Will my guilt be the only thing I'm left of
Did I make my father proud
Tell me, when I'm dead and gone
Will I ever tell her she my real love
Did I ever get rid of the pressure
Did I make my momma proud
Howling at the moon like
I'm just trying to find myself tonight
Alright, okay, howling at the moon like
All I want is Z's in my life tonight, alright, okay

[Verse 2]
I'm thinking too much, R.I.P. to my sanity
Arrivederci, don't mask your lies for a masterpiece
All I've got in my pocket is a little bit of love, and a rocketship
It's not much like the tattoo on your wrist
But when I'm dead, I'll miss you and them luscious lips
Take me away
Into another world where the chosen ones
Ain't the only ones
It's a never ending search
For my balance, it's a challenge
But I try to make it work
For a lesson, I ask questions like

[Bridge]
Livin', livin' in a pack of wolves
I don't know if this is meant to choose
