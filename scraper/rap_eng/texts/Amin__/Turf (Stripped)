[Verse 1]
Walking on the pavement I check my pride and my teeth on
The girl I grew up with lives a couple houses down
The 8 Bus run the same, dogs howl when the train
Comes like me ex girl and next girl
Used to rock the S curl
Wanted me a Nextel but my momma copped a Razr
That's why I couldn't blame her
Flipping through my past like I used to flip the phone
They kicking out the blacks and all the houses getting clones
Friends used to do pills and only eat at Deuce Grill
The food was pretty good but the times was better
These are the only days I missed
Like the first shawty I kissed
I used to have dreams now I dream

[Hook]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighbourhood
Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go
And once I do they'll finally see the enemy

[Verse 2]
Everybody wanna be a star, everybody want a nice car
Everybody wanna live great, have a good damn time, never trip with the law
The popo up in PO, dirtier than VO
Police from the past act like I'm they fucking hero
Living in LA for the weather, I facetime mom when I miss her
I got some homies that'll never leave my home
When I pull up to the corner, it smell like Miley Cyrus
I told em' I don't smoke, they say "boy, you fucking wildin'"
Innocent and young, reckless and we dumb
Our heart is like our earth and memories the sun

[Hook]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighbourhood
Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go
And once I do they'll finally see the enemy

[Verse 3]
Mentality the same from my folks
Momma wanna see me happy, she don't wanna see me broke
I said "bread wine, sauvignon, rastafari, babylon"
You can never die if I live it like a prize (hey!)
Who knows who I am, who knows who I are
Most people pretty sketch like a night at Echo Park
That's why I just keep it cool but my time is in a leisure
Everytime I'm home I catch emotion like a seizure

[Interlude]
I cut the first night, we fuck around, I put my finger in her bootyhole cause you know you gotta test the water with hoes. A-a-and then.. *laughing*
I slip and slide through the times in my youth
What's the age? Too young to worry, too old to dream
What's the age? Imagination to me, tragedy to some
What's the age? I guess we'll find out when we're older. Touch√©

[Hook]
I look around and I see nothing in my neighbourhood
Not satisfied don't think I ever wanna stay for good
Packed up my bags, told mom and dad I gotta go, go
And once I do they'll finally see the enemy

[Outro]
