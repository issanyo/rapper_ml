[Intro: Andy Clutterbuck]
Yeah, you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Hey! Dark night (Cold) Red coupe (Fast)
Picked you up on time (Wow) A full house (Cool)
Whipping down Sunset (Dark) High beams (Light)
No I didn't swipe right (Nah) This was natural (It was)
Took off my sweaters, left me with a... wife beater
I never hit a girl, but I let my... wife beat her
My reason not to reason
Always change up like seasons every evening
I try to get too even like I'm Steven
If I say that I want you then I mean it
No sugarcoating, this is potent
I wish we would've known what we know now
Times get colder, and feelings get bolder
Just like Colorado when it snows 'round
Got love by the buku, we kick it like jiu-jitsu
You always like to post me a couple things from voodoo
You say your mama lives vicariously through you
Shawty's cool times two, she's cuckoo
Girl it's looking like a cold night (It is)
So I had to use the foggy lights (I did)
No I don't have a Tesla (Nah, but ...)

[Chorus: Andy Clutterbuck]
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night

[Verse 2: Andy Clutterbuck]
I want to treat you something special
Give you what you deserve
I want to take you to paradise
In a 1950's Merc

[Pre-Chorus: Andy Clutterbuck]
And I can't help but wonder
Just how we ended up alright
And I love you like no other
And this has never felt so right

[Chorus: Andy Clutterbuck]
You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Girl you can keep me warm

[Interlude: William Coutts]
Still live and uncut with your main man Tommy Inglethorpe. I'm continuing to keep you warm on a cold, cold night. And if you still don't got a lover, just close your eyes and let Honne and Aminé guide you through darkness

[Bridge: Andy Clutterbuck]
There's just one thing
Girl you could have anyone
So why you choosing me and not leaving me on my own?
Girl you could be with anyone
So thanks for making me your number one

[Chorus: Andy Clutterbuck]
You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
