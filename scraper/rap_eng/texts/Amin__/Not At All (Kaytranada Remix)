[Verse 1]
West side' till I mothafuckin die
503, that's where I reside
I never do play, with the foreplay
I want the whole cake baby I don't want a slice
Fuck Jermaine
I'm so so Def
Bow "Wow"
Sounds of the bed
Italiano, sexycano
Elegant chick and she pop pelligrino
Thick thick hips up in NYC
She dip dip dip all up on me
European Chick with American Apparel
Use to have a Larry now she got herself a Darrell
Black dick all in ya spouse again
She with me homie 'cause you ain't in her lane
Look, I just wanna chill
And baby keep me curious and let me know what's real
Forreal

[Verse 2]
Polaroid pictures
Peace sign flicker's
Platforms and leather jacket with the zippers
Pharrell hats and  a leather pants
Chanel bags and ya dirty vans
Living so en vogue
Why do I care about what's in vogue?
Boujee ass hoes, man you know what I mean
Montreal bitches with a lot of self esteem
I'm a Rastafari, came to party
White chicks with me but I don't do molly
Wait, wait...
You don't do Molly?
But I don't know if you wanna come with me
Ho
Not at all
Do I do love?
Baby not at all
I'm 20 years young
I just wanna have fun
Fuck a drummer, baby girl can a rapper get some?
Then I pop off ya blouse like a shotgun
Bitch nigga no baby girl I am not one
Press my buttons
Hol' up, caution
I'm the type of nigga that don't play around often
Hit me with a txt and I just might go ass so fat but I know its lypo
Greek chick so she wanna eat my gyro
School chick got me harder then a final
When it comes to the fads I always pass
That shit is for the moment and it never really lasts, yeah
It never really lasts
That shit is for the moment and it never really last

[Outro]
It's pretty simple
We all en vogue
New single
Get down, ho

[Continues with saying "Down"]
