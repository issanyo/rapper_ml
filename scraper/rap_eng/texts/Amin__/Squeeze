[Verse]
Pull up on these motherfuckers, then I hit the scene
Motherfuckers hate me 'cause I'm all about my cream
Rolling down my window, roll my pride for self-esteem
Yeah, the coolest be the fool-est 'cause them niggas really awkward
Leader and a lover like a mayor and John Mayer (Woo)
All them nights I stayed up, I get paid up like a lay-up now
Worldwide tour, so them girls wide open (Shee-)
Shows packed out, so the bus pack oceans
Unapologetic (Bitch), success is my fetish (Woo)
Young, black, and handsome, that be my aesthetic, yeah
Fenty on my baby so my boo ain't got no blemishes
Put the kitty on my face, I could take you on a trip
Tell me who the fuck makes skits for they tour? (Woo)
Tell me who the fuck makes skits for they tour? (True)
I started it, them niggas borrow it
They can't help it, haters too selfish
Secret, Good for You the best album alive
Writer and director, actor, rapper, I'm a prize
Leave 'em in the dust, tell 'em level up
I own the color yellow (Woo), Pantone, hit me up (True)
Mona Lisa for a feature, my price is priceless
Back up in this motherfucker, I gots the -itis
LST on the beat, I love my buck teeth, that's why I'm so fly-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
Traitors treat you like a reaper, RIP Kenneka (Mmm)
Practicing this verse up in the mirror like I'm Issa (Mmm)
I'm frank like Aretha (Yeah), I'm dank like your reefer (Yeah)
Flows keep switching so them niggas better keep up (Woo)
Chucks on my feet 'cause they cut me a check
I'm 'bout my business, CLBN ain't take nothing less
Question, do they have sex in the scenes with the sex?
What should I be for Halloween?
I know, me, I'm the best (True)
