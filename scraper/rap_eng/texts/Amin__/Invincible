[Chorus]
I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can’t stop now
I wanna, I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I gotta stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams
Stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams

[Post-Chorus]
I feel like a stranger to myself
And sometimes that feels dangerous but I’ll bet you'll see me
For who I truly am, maybe not if it wasn't bland
Some days I look in mirrors and I wonder who's that man
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah

[Verse]
All my people gather 'round, I'm here to inspire (True)
If you runnin' on E, I'll put the fire in your lighter (Yeah)
Black Hollywood never started and it’s over
People only care when you’re Denzel or Oprah (Yeah)
Kosher, holster, make my homies bolder (Woo)
When your fear's near, you don’t wanna get closer (No)
Rappers sound the same so they chains gettin' colder (Yeah)
Women, claim your boy for some credit and some doja (Hey)
Hold up, that's just how we make it (Yeah)
Black never breaks so your patience gotta face it (Damn)
Know my life matter, but my matter keep on achin' (True)
This a warning, never conforming (No)

[Chorus]
I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can’t come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I wanna, I wanna fly right now
I wanna see all my homies get down
I wanna feel like I can't come down
I got a dream so I can't stop now
I gotta stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest thing is believing in your dreams
Stop feeling invisible and start feeling invincible
Hate, feeling impossible
The hardest feeling is believing in your dreams

[Outro]
Ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah, ah yeah
