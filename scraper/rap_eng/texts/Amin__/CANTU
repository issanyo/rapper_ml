[Chorus]
I got my head hangin' out the fuckin' window
I got my head hangin' out the fuckin' window
I keep my speakers ringin' on me like my cellphone
I got them dreads, bussin' bussin'
'Cause I might wanna let my hair down
Yeah, bitch I let my hair down
Yeah, I got them dreads swingin' 'round
Yeah, 'cause bitch I let my hair down (yeah yeah)
I got 'em bussin', bussin', bussin', bussin' (hey)

[Verse 1]
White girl wanna touch it (yeah)
I told her please don't touch me (no)
She said, "Who the fuck is your stylist?" (huh)
I told that bitch, "My cousin" (yuh)
Rinsed out, picked out, Cantu in my hair (hey)
Louis V like Virg (yuh), I'm Gucci down (brr! brr!)

So I'm just here to pass the word lil' nigga (yuh)

[Chorus]
I got my head hanging out the fuckin' window (hey)

[Verse 2]
It's me, young Amin√©, I pop off when you see me
No hiccups for my niggas, pass the mula like a relay (yeah)

Don't ask me just to pet me 'cause you can't, ho
Dreadlock rocker with a certified bopper (true)
Jenny, Becky, and Samantha wanna touch me 'cause I'm handsome

[Chorus]
I got my head hanging out the fuckin' window (hey)
I got my head hanging out the fuckin' window (that's right)
I keep my speakers ringing on me like my cellphone (she)

[Outro: Rickey Thompson]
Who has nice hair? Me
Who can touch my hair? Not you
Did you think this was a petting zoo?
Do I look like somebody's dog?
Do I look like somebody's cow?
Do I look like somebody's lamb? No!
Sit down!
