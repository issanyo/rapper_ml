[Intro: Aminé]
Yeah, you know I'm back in the building
Yeah, where did you think I went?
I didn't go nowhere, I'm still, I'm-I'm right here
Yeah man, yeah you know it's-it's been cool
The sun has been shining
You know what I mean, how 'bout you?
I don't give a fuck
Look

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Westside baby, PDX made me
503 'til I D-I- (You know)
Ain't shit sweet but the pussy I eat
And you know I'm in this bitch like a IUD (Yee)
I'm the dude that your girl told you not to worry 'bout (True)
Now I'm your house with my legs on the couch (True)
Face pointed south so her ass wanna bounce (Hey)
Shawty give me head when I respect her
So I get head all the time (Hey)
That's why I'm ahead of the time (Hey)
My verse is priceless, my touch is Midas
I'm in New Zealand, my chains from Iceland (Hey) (Period)
Reel it in, tell a friend
Amine got the juice and I'm always gon' sin (Yeah)
After school with it like a nigga Dom Kennedy (Yeah)
Smoke big dope just to take away the pain in me
I'm a grown ass man
Pussy ass niggas can't stop my plans (Nah)
No handouts, I don't need no hand (Nah)
Your girl walked in said "Play my jam" (Play my jam)
I ain't Timberlake but I make your feelings ache (True)
Girls twerk and sing to the shit I make (Yee)
I wonder why she don't like a nigga like me (Hey)
Maybe she does but her pride too mighty

[Chorus: Aminé]
I'm not sure what I see
Cupid don't fuck with me
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Wait is this a sign?)
She's looking in my eyes
I don't see no other guys (No)
Are you telling me this is a sign? (Wait is this a sign?)

[Interlude: Aminé]
Oh my god, that's hard
Woah!

[Verse 2: Aminé]
I'm too jaded, walls keep caving
Might say I'm good but I got two faces
Feels so basic, hard to say this
I like a girl that dance like honey
And always 'bout it, 'bout it
But she 'bout that money

[Outro: Unknown Mortal Orchestra & Aminé]
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting
Hunnybee, Hunnybee
There's no such thing
As sweeter a sting (Uh huh, uh huh)
Hunnybee (Yeah), Hunnybee
There's no such thing (Yeah yeah)
As sweeter a sting
