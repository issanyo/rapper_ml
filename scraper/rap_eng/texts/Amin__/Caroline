Kenneth Cole
On my soul
We can go
Born in the bungalow
2 times like stereo
Hold up look here we go

YEEZY tho
On my soul
We can go

Raised over by 43rd
Then move to Elizabeth
That's where them razas is
Why they so serious
Damn town so hideous
But people be feeling this
Don't understand
How you can look up at man
And by fingers on his hand
Pull the 9 out and blam
Get locked up and then
Do the same thing again


Holding crowns
Hold it down
Stronger now
Than a goddamn forty round
U heard me now
It's the poverty poster child
That's how they see me
And
They wanna be me
But
Skill don't come easy
Nigga
As I'm throwing up freebies
Nigga
Now I'm all on yo TV
And I'm lifting so regularly
Heavily
Scarily
Barely 263

Preachers preach
Holy me holy God
Holy key on my god
Feel so good neck message
Figaro crescendo we can go
Get Crossaints
Hoes is not what I got
She's kinda spouse
So aroused
So smart
On my god
It's evident
Intelligent
Intelligence
Passing tests
Much respect
Much obliged
She flex like muscled guys
We be lit like moonlight
Things be too right
We see eye to eye and on sight
And we had like one fight
And it was over a bitch right?
Hey karma's a bitch right?
Hope you don't fist fight
Hope you don't world star
Hope u don't murder
Don't hail no hydra

In the gym
More than thin
Maxing out
These ain't out
Pereleased
Preachers preach
Holy me holy God holy key

That's only on me
Success ain't never free
Like time and energy
Just Let me be

They must not know a genius
I make fire like gas is leaking

We will not be peasants
We will so be large
We can be victorious
So Glorious
Peniaphobia

I'm the grand ruler
I ain't know I had shooters
Why are they acting Timon
Cause a nigga so Pumba?
Or a Mufasa
Nigga ill rock em
Did niggas forget that I'm cold
Imagine the albums that I could have sold
Imagine the passion I could have told
Imagine the dragons I wanna know
Imagine the tactics practice, lacking of a mattress to get to this rapping
Imagine the actors or actresss
Who rap like this but they acting

THE REST WAS FREESTYLED ADD IT IF YOU WANT
