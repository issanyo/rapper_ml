[Intro]
Ah, yeah-yeah
Ah, woah

[Chorus]
I need a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a...

[Verse 1]
Spice Girl, freaky lil mama
Said she on a diet so she only eat bananas
Always in your prime, other women don't align
And when I'm off work then you know it's bed time
So let's go (hey), let's hit the I-5
Get away from B.S., don't waste no down time (hey)
I don't ever like 'em boujee, that's the type that wanna sue me
And when we get together, hit it like viva forever

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, is this real or fake?
Do I have a chance or am I pavin' ways?
I'm tryna find a reason not to say your name
Like you, there's no look-a-like

[Chorus]
I need a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a...

[Verse 2]
British girl (hey)
Got a show in London
Won't you come around? Put you on the list, it's nothin'
Say you gotta work 'cause you're studyin' for Masters
Yeah, these women fine but only on the camera (ooh)
They deceivin', super thievin'
They feelings come and go like when they weave in
I never listen to the schemin' type
I want the Sporty, Scary, Ginger spice

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna know, is this real or fake?
Do I have a chance or am I pavin' ways?
I'm tryna find a reason not to say your name
Like you, there's no look-a-like

[Chorus]
I need a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a Spice Girl
Zig-a-zig-ah, fuck up my whole world
Posh when she talk, nothin' like old girl
Scary and Sporty, tell her what I want
What I really, really want is a...

[Outro]
My girl's a Spice Girl
Her world's my world
And most of all she's fine to me
And aligned with the infatuation I feel
I need a Spice Girl
