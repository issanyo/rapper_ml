[Intro: Aminé]
Mi partner, mi partner
Mi partner, mi partner
Mi partner, mi partner
Say mi partner, mi partner

[Chorus: Karma Kid]
Ghost through the tundra
Sail through the jungle
Swim through the deep blue
I'm lost in the moment with you
I'm lost in the moment with you
Ghost through the tundra
Sail through the jungle
Swim through the deep blue
I'm lost in the moment with you

[Verse 1: Aminé]
Look, nigga
Words sharp like an IV, don't try me
No way, José, you's a bitch, oh I see
Blake Lively, holla at me, see I be
The nigga with the fiery flows, it's Aminé
If you think you're on my level then you're prolly just high
Niggas ask for features, I say, "No," they're like, "Why?"
Cos' I'ma come around when them commas come around
Karma Kid say, "kill 'em," but I don't even gotta try
Mothafucka this that shit, I'ma kill 'em with this shit
My name Aminé not Animé, understand that shit
I'm a blacked out Moses, trapped out Joseph
God always got me, but my partners don't do shit
Mi partner, dem, dem
They gon' kill for a nigga, they gon' ride for a nigga, yeah
Mi partner, dem, dem
They gon' shoot for a nigga, they gon' root for a nigga, yeah

[Chorus: Karma Kid]
Ghost through the tundra
Sail through the jungle
Swim through the deep blue
I'm lost in the moment with you
I'm lost in the moment with you

[Bridge: Karma Kid]
Set adrift with me for a day or two, girl
No one has to know where we are goin' to

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Boys talk gun talk, that's not me
I'd rather use hands, nigga, I'm Ali
I one two punch from the 5-0-3
Then will prolly hit a lick if that chain icy, nigga
You all about your dollars, I'm about my yen
Don't ever call me fam when we far from kin
I'll rock out with my cock out 'til the day I die
Countin' up your paper doesn't mean you can multiply
Far from undercover, mothafucka I am gutta gutta
What you thought this was? Still, nigga, I ain't Chris Tucker
You can't do a damn thing 'bout the campaign
If you wanna hate, well damn, that's a damn shame
It's all gravy, these niggas lazy
That's why me and my partners, we work crazy
I can't stand a hatin' nigga
That's why I always got a plan to kill these niggas

[Chorus: Karma Kid]
Ghost through the tundra
Sail through the jungle
Set adrift with me for a day or two, girl
Ghost through the tundra
Sail through the jungle
No one has to know where we are goin' to

[Bridge: Karma Kid]
Set adrift with me for a day or two, girl
No one has to know where we are goin' to
