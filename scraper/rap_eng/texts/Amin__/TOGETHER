[Chorus: LA Priest]
You've waited long, forever
A heart is worth the weather
You should go out and get her
And learn to love together

[Verse 1: Amine]
I fucked things up, I see it in this cup (Yeah)
I didn't mean to suck, I'm stuck
Sometimes I'm just too honest (Sorry), admittin' that it's common
I should've used my common sense
So now I've gots to vent (Yeah)
I can't stand you, but I want you
We s'posed to be together forever

[Pre-Chorus: Amine]
Leakin' from the pain, need a Band Aid (Hey!)
You're the main thing I need to maintain (Whoo!)
Almost had my baby, need a damn drink (Damn drink)
Swimmin' through your feelings, how I stay sane (Stay sane)
You're the one I need, I hope this really works (Really works)
'Cause everything I need is always in your purse (Purse)
Back again, yeah I'm back again (Back)
I truly miss when you and me were only friends (Yee)
When it was just innocent (Yeah)
And we ain't have a past (True)
Sometimes I wish we could skip
To the part where we all just laugh (Yeah)

[Chorus: LA Priest]
You've waited long, forever
A heart is worth the weather
You should go out and get her
And learn to love together

[Verse 2: Amine]
I don't wanna be at your wedding (No)
I wanna be in your wedding (Yuh)
Matter of fact, call Donell Jones
So he can sweedle-dee at your wedding (Sweedle-dee dee dee)
But if this don't work out (Yeah)
I might have to go and work out (Yuh)
Even if I'm late I'ma keep her
I'm a college dropout (True)
I'ma work this all out (Yeah)
I'ma get my thoughts out (Bitch)
I'ma kick them thots out (Yeah)
Block all the numbers so I never get a text out (Oh yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Amine]
Leaking from the pain, need a Band Aid (Band-aid)
You're the main thing I need to maintain (Maintain)
Almost had my baby, need a damn drink (A damn drink)
Swimmin' through your feelings, how I stay sane (I stay sane)
You're the one I need, I hope this really works (Really works)
'Cause everything I need is always in your purse (In your purse)
Back again (Yuh), yeah I'm back again (I'm back)
My life around common, I miss when we were friends (Sorry)
When it was just innocent (Sorry)
And we ain't have a past (Damn)
I wanna skip to the part
Where it's you and me layin' on our backs (Yeah)

[Chorus: LA Priest & Amine]
You've waited long, forever
A heart is worth the weather
You should go out and get her
And learn to love together
