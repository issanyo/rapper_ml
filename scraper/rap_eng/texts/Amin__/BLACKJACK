[Verse 1]
I just bought a new grill (yah)
Shining like a new whip (true!)
Adam got a new drip (shit!)
I'm a nappy-headed black lil cool kid (ahh)
Yeah I stack that, make that, break that, take that
Got a hundred ways I can flip that, get back
All up in the money just to get back, bitch, back up
No you probably need a Tic Tac, it's that (hunh!)
Bitch you frontin' on me, why you wanna act like this? (why?)
Rollie on my wrist so she wanna have kids (true!)
Cuffs on my wrist so the cops don't trip

[Chorus]
I-I'm too fly to fight (yup)
Can't afford my price (no!)
This a white tee (clean)
Bitch, bite me (hey!)
I'm on the high (I'm on a high)
They on the low (they on the low)
You're killin' my vibe (killin' it)
Get out my zone (get out my zone)
Said, I'm on the high (I'm on a high)
They on the low (they on the low)
You're killin' my vibe (killin' it)
Get out my zone (get out my zone bitch)

[Verse 2]
I'm the best in the group chat (true!)
My niggas won't admit that (no!)
31 hoes in my Facetime
And I'm the one to hoop that (yee)
Rockin' and rollin' like Jack Black
Schoolin' you niggas like Jack Black (yah!)
How could you not like Jack Black? (how?)
I put that on my mama nigga, no cap
Look, I hand it to Yos, he hand it to Jon (he do)
Shawty wanna fuck for a picture
Bitch, this ain't a Groupon (no!)
This that CLBN (true!)
Go ahead bump it with mom
Said she want a spot on my list (please!)
I told her go pray to your God (I need to go to church)
Yeah, I dig that, flip that, make that, check back
When I wanna get it back ASAP
It's that young nigga back, no six pack, fuck that
I'm too rich for the chit-chat

[Chorus]
I'm too fly to fight (yup)
Can't afford my price (noo)
This a white tee (clean)
Bitch, bite me (hey!)
I'm on the high (I'm on the high)
They on the low (they on the low)
You're killin' my vibe (killin' it)
Get out my zone (get out my zone)
Said, I'm on the high (I'm on the high)
They on the low (you on the low)
You're killin' my vibe (killin' it)
Get out my zone (get out my zone bitch)
