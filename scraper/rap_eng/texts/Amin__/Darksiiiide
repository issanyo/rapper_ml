[Hook]
Moonlight is shining bright
And sunlight is going down
So I just feel like
The dark side is rising
The dark side is rising

[Verse: 1]
This my I don't give a fuck side
This my god damnit motherfuckin darkside
This my, this my, this my I don't give a fuck side
This my god damnit motherfuckin darkside, yeah
Says she like my crew
Says she like the way we do
Says she wanna come and rule
Make that bitch just come and go
Scuff scuff on my shoes
Get them panties loose
This my darkside if you livin for the crew
