[Verse 1]
Yeah, hit up my baby girl (woo)
'Cause I thought about her (yeah)
Know we haven't talked in weeks (we haven't)
But I know you want the nana (ahh)
No this ain't no booty call (dang)
It's just a late night snack (it is)
My mama still at work (she is)
And I just got me some Trojans (protected)
Dick like ADT (yeah)
Bus too long, teleport to me
Lookin' like she red wine (yuh)
And my shawty like a 10, she a not 9 (true)
Wouldn't trade her for a jewel and pearl (woah)
Only diamonds maybe (yeah)
I'm lookin' for my Usher album (yeah)
So my chances get better when you...

Feel your tongue on my teeth, so I (true)
Do my best to keep in mind that you're human
And you trip sometimes (yeah)
Keep it a buck 250 (woo)
Let me know if you're a little bit iffy (woo)
Don't know what you want, you're complicated (yeah)
I'm frustrated, na-na-na-na na-na-na-na

You 'cause you perfect galore
I shoulda put more effort in it
I'm runnin' through the race to finish

So my chances get better when you...
