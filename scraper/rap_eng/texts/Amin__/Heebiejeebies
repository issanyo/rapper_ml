[Verse 1: Aminé & Kehlani]
I got the baddest bitch
Shorty keep hollerin’ at me
Told her I’m a young OG from the west
And I’m repping up the 503
I ain’t no average bitch
Baby come swing my way
Imma put you on this game
Get it all gas no breaks (skrrt)

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé & Kehlani / Kehlani]
Just for you I might jeopardize
My whole life I might sacrifice
Way you look is like woah (woah)
Got me locked and I’m hypnotized
Shakira-like and these hips don’t lie
Say I don’t but I always try
Way you look is like woah
Got me locked and I’m hypnotized

[Chorus: Aminé & Kehlani]
You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species
Give me heebiejeebies
Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I'm like woah woah woah
You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species
Give me heebiejeebies
Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I’m like woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
Don’t you know you’re something else?
Don’t you know that there’s no one else?
Must I remind you?
Real ones behind you
Don’t look, I’m gonna find you

[Pre-Chorus: Kehlani]
So, just for you I might jeopardize
My whole life I might sacrifice
Baby got me like woah
Hypnotize ‘em like woah
Shakira-like and these hips don’t lie
Say I don’t but I always try
Cause baby lookin’ like woah
Woah…

[Chorus: Aminé & Kehlani]
You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species
Give me heebiejeebies
Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I'm like woah woah woah
You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species
Give me heebiejeebies
Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I’m like woah, woah, woah

[Verse 3: Aminé]
Took my time, now I start to see signs
In too deep now I can’t rewind
Lil mama she gonna work out
When she do the Bowflex then we have more sex
Sweat, drippin, now I wanna kick it
Cheated on you with some dumb bum bitches
Your momma wouldn’t be too proud
Girl we in public, don’t be too loud
Sugar pie, Aminé never tell no lies
Love and lust it’s just both of us
I’d rather talk to you to get by
I don’t really play no games
Unless it’s with my friends and we playing 2k
Baby I'm on one, I'm here for the long run (with you)

[Chorus: Aminé & Kehlani]
You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species
Give me heebiejeebies
Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I'm like woah woah woah
You, you got so much potential
Every moment spent with you
I bet was always eventful
I've never seen your type of species
Give me heebiejeebies
Attitude Khaleesi
Woah, and I’m like woah, woah, woah
