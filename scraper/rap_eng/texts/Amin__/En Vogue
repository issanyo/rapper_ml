[Intro]
Oh
[?], yeah
Oh
Drowning
Oh, I'm drownin', oh
I'm fallin'
Oh, I'm fallin' for it
Another blind sheep in society
Don't know how this is
For [?]
Tell me what's [?]
And what's the blue [?]
Are you with himself
Or do you wanna go to?
Let's start
And never come back
It's a very big world
I think you'll never wanna come back
Stuck in a TV
Far from reality
Sinking slowly
What I wanna be on big screens
[?]
[?]
Oh, now the window
Far from [?]
Drownin'
Oh, we drownin' deep
And lookin' like a bunch of sheep
I'm fallin'
Oh, I'm fallin' for it
Somebody help me
Oh I'm drownin' deep
Drownin' deep
Fadin' away
Drownin' deep

[Interlude]
See, we love to pursue what's popular
But in reality, you're stuck en vogue
Nigga shoot, I got 20 on they head
Man, 20? Throw another dub down, boy
[?] don't make no money, man
Nah nigga, I'm finna take yo money and go buy them new J's that come out on Saturday
Heh, you still on J's, man? Wait 'til I get my hands on the dice, man
I'm 'bout to take yo money and go buy my bitch that new Versases
Nigga, it's Versace man
Versace? Well shit bruh, it's the same thing, man
Hold up, hold up, so you really 'bout to go buy this bitch some Versace?
Ay man, I'm doin' anything, you can do it too if it get you in them draws
Damn, I guess money can buy love
Man, money can buy anything (Anything, anything)

[Verse 1]
Hol' up, you know the name
I'm rollin' through cities where critics do hang
Bitches and niggas be like, be like
And I swear I can't stand it, I need me a life
Give me one reason to really believe that you not in herd and you not a sheep
Why could ya? Twerkin' is really appraised
The morals of women is getting [?]

[Chorus]
Hol' up, you're obsessed with what's en vogue
Let the media tell you what you don't know
Say you're obsessed with what's en vogue
Wanna be star but you say it's too hard
Say you're obsessed with what's en vogue
Wanna learn how to twerk but you don't know
Say you're obsessed with what's en vogue
Want Versace but you're too broke-e

[Verse 2]
How you love social media but you be un-sourceful?
Tweetin' 'bout your ex and how you be so loyal
Milly followers, but you got no money
Famous when I tell him, man that shit is pretty funny
And to my people that ain't even black
When did it become okay for you to say nigga?
And to my niggas, oh to my niggas
When did it become okay for us to say that?
A-a-a-a-a-amin√©
Shit hotter than summers in Chile
This is a PSA, public announcement
Countin' my funds, I need me a fountain
I am the one, call me the Simba
I am here to take the place of Mufasa
Don't be a bum, please be a leader
Don't be a [?], see how you [?]
Hol' up

[Chorus]
Hol' up, you're obsessed with what's en vogue
Let the media tell you what you don't know
Say you're obsessed with what's en vogue
Wanna be star but you say it's too hard
Say you're obsessed with what's en vogue
Wanna learn how to twerk but you don't know
Say you're obsessed with what's en vogue
Want Versace but you're too broke-e, hol' up

[Bridge]
Tell me why you love?
When it's really like a drug
Why you in a rush?
Baby, please don't love
Baby, please don't love
Baby, please don't
Ohh, baby, please don't love
Ohh, baby, please don't

[Outro]
Don't, don't love me now
Baby, shawty don't love on me now
My shawty, my baby, don't love on me now, now
Don't love on me now
Baby girl, can you not love?
Can you not?
Can you not?
I ain't got time for a thot, no
But in reality, you're stuck en vogue
