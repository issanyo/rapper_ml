[Verse 1]
I don't wanna plan (woo), I just wanna dance (yeah)
Fuck a fortune teller, they can't tell me who I am
I'm a yellow mellow fellow and my cousin is the sun
I'm Aminé to my niggas and Animé to a punk (hey)
When I give her Jimmy, then my baby give me Neutron
Verses I be shoppin', you can bet I got them deals (shit)
I could die tomorrow, so my future got some pressure
Pay tuition for my sis and cop my mom a Tesla

[Pre-Chorus]
Old me is stuck in the new one
Red pill cause don't take the blue one
Wonderland doesn't seem too bad
I think I'm gonna wallow in tomorrow like yeah

[Chorus]
Who knows what the future holds?
I don't, if the truth be told
They say play it safe, young soul
Fuck that, Imma take control
I was dead until I sought out (yeah)
Took my time (woo) and then I found out (true)
Got some tears, they made me ball out (woo)
Took my fears, and threw 'em all out (all out)

[Verse 2]
Pace it, I don't ever chase it
If I need some time, I'ma stretch it like it's latex
Jesus take the wheel, I need David Copperfield
Parallel to parasails, I'm Aminé McFly
Bitter as Moana (woo), flexin' like I'm Maui (true)
I don't care what people think, I'm perfect in my psyche
Sike! Bitch, I'm not, I'm just insecure as most
Life could change in a blink, don't know what the future holds

[Pre-Chorus]
Old me is stuck in the new one
Red pill cause don't take the blue one
Wonderland doesn't seem too bad
I think I'm gonna wallow in tomorrow like yeah

[Chorus]
Who knows what the future holds?
I don't, if the truth be told
They say play it safe, young soul
Fuck that, I'ma take control
I was dead until I sought out (yeah)
Took my time (woo) and then I found out (true)
Got some tears, they made me ball out (woo)
Took my fears, and threw 'em all out (all out)

[Bridge]
All out, I'm goin' all out
If you try to stop me you can bet I'm goin' all out
Runnin' up the numbers 'cause I can and I want to
This your favorite song, you gon' sing it 'til it's past due
All out, I'm goin' all out
This your favorite song, you gon' sing it 'til I ball out
Bitch I'm in the clouds....
Runnin' in a trance, got you runnin'....

[Outro]
I don't know when I'm gonna die
My watch can't tell the time
Hopefully there's some hope in me
I won't trip if it's meant to be
I don't know when I'm gonna die
My watch can't tell the time
Hopefully there's some hope in me
I won't trip if it's meant to be
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh, ahhhh
Ahhhh
I don't know when I'm gonna die
Hopefully there's... hope in me
I don't know when I'm gonna die
Hopefully there's... hope in me
