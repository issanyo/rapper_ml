[Verse 1: D.Worthy]
I'm the man out the kids huh?
I came up from the fuckin' bottom
Now I got all of them niggas on it
Blow up kids nigga rep it down
I rep my granddad when he laying down
I rep my granddad when he laying down
Swear I bout to make a million figures
Keep them records sellin out the store
Sold out shows book me for the tour
It's going down the hoes love allure
But guess what bitch I got me some more

[Hook]

[Verse 2: D.Worthy]
Running up the money like the motherfucking lotto
In the city like a role model
All these bitches wanna follow
Know my twitter
Know my name
And these bitches say I changed
Nigga never stayed the same
I've been grindin' for the chain
Gotta get a range
Put a grammy in my grammy's house
Get my momma to Miami now
Get my uncles livin' overseas
Gotta get them young niggas somethin' they can fuckin' see
Put it in a newspaper
Bitches say that I'm the man
Change everything in the city
You don't understand when I say I do it
I do this shit for fuckin' real
Four years in the makin' how it fuckin' feel
Cause I've been on a mission
I've been grindin' since the beginnin'
If these niggas wanna know that I'm muthafuckin' wining'
Twenty-two on the change
Forty-five hundred make change
If them bitches wanna know
They already know my name

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Aminé]
Aminé

Runnin' through cities with niggas that came
Fuck with a nigga cause you know that I bang
Infinit Records
Infinit Records
Homie I'm livin'

I get it
Wether you love it or love it to hate it
Just know that you care
So nigga we made it
Ore-gon then I'm done
My nigga my nigga you know it
I'm a poet in a poet
A couple of bitches who know it
Gonna hate a rest in peace and a western deep
You fuckin' with a nigga who just fuck with freaks
Yeah I fuck with freaks
Yeah I fuck with freaks
Fuck with freaks in a western [?]
A young stunner
Packing heat
No butter
Main day on a work day
I'm Adam to my lovers
I'mma go in
I'mma go in
I'mma go in all day
And the program
Yeah the program is to kill these niggas always
Faded of patron
And I'm gone
Tryna' find my baby
She say "Boy I don't condone"
She asked me where I've been
She say you never home
She say "Will you leave me alone"
I said baby cut the noise
