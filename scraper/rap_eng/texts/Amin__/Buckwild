[Verse 1]
Picked her up
I said "What's good"
She said "Boy, you misunderstood"
She's always in a bad mood but, tonight she wanna take the wood
(Vroom)
Turn on the car
Drive me somewhere where we could see all the stars
I always turn the lights on but, she wanna fuck in the dark
Agendas, always on the mental
Always gotta plan for what happens in advance
She not a player she just crush a lot
She call me daddy 'cause she miss her pops
I'm a drug song credit card
She wanna love but that's typical
And she just fucks she don't make love
'Cause shawty's only worried 'bout her paystubs

[Hook]
I try to be the one that she really wants
But then I think is this what she really wants
When you treat someone like you supposed to
And they end up blaming you to hate you, uh-huh
Is that a human trait
Or is it just a game

[Verse 2]
Plot twist
I'm back once again
The girl from the first verse wanna be friends
It's funny how things turn around, yeah
And everything's full circle now
I got a thing for girls who can rock my world
And the way I spit make 'em say some shit like
"I miss you and you miss me too"
You know that's a lie girl bye

[Bridge]
Got a thing for them girls who can read me
Summer days are the days when you see me
Remember when we used to ride to that Yeezy
Oh that reminds me, you still got my CD

[Prehook]
Men lie, women lie, nobody the same
People got a thing for playing so many games
I loved you the most when you loved me the least
And now that I'm gone you can see what I mean singing

[Hook]
She tries to be the one that I really want
But then I think is this what I really want
When you treat someone like you supposed to
And they end up blaming you to hate you, uh-huh
Is that a human trait
I think it's just a game
