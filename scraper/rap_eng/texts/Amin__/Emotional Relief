[Verse 1:]
Loving gets so hard to do
You couldn't know
What my heart's been through
Oh love it gets so hard to do
Its because of my emotions
Loving gets so hard to do
It's because of your emotions
Oh loving you
It gets so hard to do
Loving you
It gets so hard to do
My emotions
Don't know how to cope it
My emotions
Don't know what to do
My emotions
I am my emotions
My emotions
My emotions
My emotions
