[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel like I need ya
You're a catch but I'm not a receiver
I'm nervous what this might turn into
Know my skin glows whenever I see ya

[Chorus]
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'

[Verse 1]
I fuck up like everyday, I fuck up in every way
I fuck up like when I pull up on Sunday at Chick-Fil-A
My-my dark twisted fantasy, beautiful insanity
When the rain pours, I'm the one you call your canopy
Face be moisturized, sun keep beamin' on your thighs
In Hawaii lookin' fly, my obsession multiplies, yeah
Butter on my fingers I'm nothing like Jerry Rice
When you glow, that's how I glow
So my feelings they pay the price

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel like I need ya
You're a catch but I'm not a receiver
I'm nervous what this might turn into
Know my skin glows whenever I see ya

[Chorus]
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'

[Verse 2]
Is this shit forever? Where's the evidence?
Should I even bother? I guess that's confidence
We sippin' sake soakin' sun so sofa's never comfy
So sorry summer's over but you still my lil' mami
I wake up, then get up, graveyard shift 'til 5
You stay up, then we fuck, you always down to ride
When she do the tip drill, throw it like a pinwheel
My problems only minor, nonexistent like a kids' wheel

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna feel like I need ya
You're a catch but I'm not a receiver
I'm nervous what this might turn into
Know my skin glows whenever I see ya

[Chorus]
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'
That's why I'm shinin', shinin', shinin', shinin'
