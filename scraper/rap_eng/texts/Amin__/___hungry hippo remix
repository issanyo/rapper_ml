[Intro]
Let's just, let's ju-
Let's just do this and quit acting like
We ain't got life
Let's just do this, let's just do this
(It's the remix baby)

[Chorus]
She likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, "Thanks my girl designed it"
Amin√© might just steal your girl
If you call me Trey Songz, I don't mind it
Try it, west side nigga I am
Liking, the way that you move
The way that you move
It's the way that you move

[Verse]
I'm on South Beach, tryna leave
High as hell, need vacancy
Got a flight that I gotta catch so sober up for security
You know TSA don't play
These rappers get the PJ but they don't make PJ weigh
It's sad cause it's so fake
My nigga why you fucking your commas up?
Spending a grand on lunch
You gon' be broke with that kinda stuff
You ain't even bought your mama shit
But you gotta spend cause you wanna look rich
This LA living got you changin'
You out here shining on these niggas like you stainless
You out here ballin' on these niggas, Calvin Cambridge
Ayy tell me, is this life you live worth it?
Does the ice you rock make you painless?

[Outro]
She likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, "Thanks my girl designed it"
