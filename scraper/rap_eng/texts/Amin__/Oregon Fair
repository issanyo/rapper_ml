[Verse 1:]
Not lookin' for relationship
Just lookin' for a summer chick
The one that neva' stress me out
The one that I just kick it with
It's funny when They'd rather have
A trapper then a pastor
A raptor then a mothafuckin' nigga with a masters
These hoes man
Why they all so basic
Get a couple likes
Now she thinkin that she famous
Six feet deep
For them six inch heels
But she bad as hell
So who da' fuck cares?
Cameron Diazes, Megan good-asses
Puerto Rican, Caribbean
I love all the masses
ATLien
I'm such an outkast
Probably have to get chain and a durag
For her attention
And did I mention
I took her on a date in my mommas van
She looked at me and told me
I can only fuck wit benzes
Haha
Wit benzes
(hell naw)
