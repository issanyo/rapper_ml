[Part I]

[Intro]
Yeah, uh huh, yeah

[Hook]
I like my hoes ratchet, I like my bitch bad
I like a freaky lil' mama who gon' throw it back
I like them forty-inch nails, and your weave too
And if you ain't got a man, fuck with me boo

[Verse 1]
I like when she call me daddy, and she look back (back)
I like when shawty give me head on the drive back (nasty)
I call her lil' mama when her lips gloss (true)
I like when shawty do the dummy on my dick raw
(dick, dick, dick, hey)
I don't say no "Yes I do," I eat pussy like it's food (true)
I'm the choice for choosey hoes
Your friend cute, let's make a group
I'm a wild, wild nigga from the west side, hoe (west)
Take a picture on my left, 'cause that's my best side, hoe
(shit, shit, shit)

[Hook]
I like my hoes ratchet, I like my bitch bad
I like a freaky lil' mama who gon' throw it back
I like them forty-inch nails, and your weave too
And if you ain't got a man, fuck with me boo

[Bridge]
Let's get wild, wild, let's get wild, wild
Let's get wild, wild, bitch I like it wild, wild
And let's get wild, wild, and let's get wild, wild
I like it wild, wild, let's get it, woah, woah, wow, wow

[Part II]

[Chorus]
Excuse me ma'am
You're the one that I need
Fell in love, you cut me deep
Saturn girl, you're ecstasy, baby
I need your love, to stay alive
Out this world, you're out of sight
Saturn girl, you changed my life, oh

[Verse 2]
Help me find new ways to get around (I still love you girl)
You're the one I love, hope it counts for something
(I hope it counts for something)
Help me find new ways to get around (I'll protect you girl)
You're the one I love, hope it counts for something

[Chorus]
You're the one that I need
Fell in love, you cut me deep
Saturn girl, you're ecstasy, baby (ecstasy)
I need your love, to stay alive
Out this world, you're out of sight
Saturn girl, you changed my life, baby
