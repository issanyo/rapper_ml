[Refrain 1][ x2]
Is this what summer feelz?
Like when I'm on the go
Citrus in the air
Her sundress on the flo-o-o-or

[Hook]
And in the winter
And in the summer too
You just love me
In the worst way

[Refrain 2][x2]
In the winter you're hatin' me
In the summer you love to be
My mistress or my baby
But that's ok with me

[Hook]
And in the winter
And in the summer too
You just love me
In the worst way

[String Instrumental break]

[Female Harmonies]

[Verse]
Summer feelz is the worst time ever
Some niggas never make it back
And fall for the weather
The girl that you love is probably gone for forever
(Forever, ever, forever,ever?)
Maybe
The summer breeze resembles the Devil’s breath
If you feel like teen spirit, then scenes put you in check
So niggas in my neighborhood hustle ‘cause the paper good
And hoes let their flowers bloom when the weather's good
Cops swing ‘round when the sun beam down
Relationships fade like the side of my head
You say you’ll miss me next winter
You'll wonder what is real
But thats ‘cause summer feelz
