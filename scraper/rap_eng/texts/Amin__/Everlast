[Verse 1]
Pick up my wallet
I picked up my jeans
She said whats the problem
I said that's the problem
I been here for days
Grinding my ass off
Pulling my weight
But you say it's not enough
What a shame, I been here days trying to get it both ways
And shawty use my currency just to burn it up
As the currency, I just wanna know what's the plan
Girl you got options, you don't gotta stay with me
Only had a plan A, never had a plan B
I'm a stick to them ropes that I know
I need me a writer not need a fighter

[Chorus]
I just wanna be everlasting
I don't wanna die inside
It's hard to believe in my passion
When you gotta tell some lies girl
I wanna dream
Don't shoot me down girl, please don't shoot me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Don't bring me down girl, please don't bring me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Don't shoot me down girl, please don't shoot me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Keeping me stable girl you're such an anchor

[Verse 2]
Far from a perfect man, suit and ties  ain't really my thing
Shawty wants my net worth to be more than my self worth
Every time I come around the city bling bling
I just wanna know why
The blood was on the leaves but you chose to hear the beat
Oh can you tell me why
Kids are starvin' in the street when the greed is what we eat
Man It's fucked up
Mama called on the phone like I miss her
But I never tell her anything about my issues
She said I'll be fine and I always wanna listen
But I know the truth and you can't fool the youth
I lied, I lied
All the mother fucking time time
Oh I said I lied, I lied
Lied all the mother fucking time time

[Chorus]
I just wanna be everlasting
I don't wanna die inside
It's hard to believe in my passion
When you gotta tell some lies girl
I wanna dream
Don't shoot me down girl, please don't shoot me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Don't bring me down girl, please don't bring me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Don't shoot me down girl, please don't shoot me down girl
Girl I wanna dream
Keeping me stable but you're such an anchor

[Outro]
Collect calls on my phone
But she never ever picks up
She's got my heart in a sticker
And I think I'm sprung, sprung
What do I do?
Don't wanna take a loss but what I really want is you
How can I love someone when I don't even love myself
