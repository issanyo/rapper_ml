[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
Baby girl, I've had one too many
My cup ain't full, but it's got me empty
Only drink to mingle 'cause I'm single
Waiter, can you break this 20?
I'm not about the flashiness, I'm only about you and this
Drink that's in my hand, has got this plan
And has got me wasted, got me faded

[Chorus: Aminé & Charlie Wilson]
I wanna make you feel young (Feel young)
I wanna make you feel something (Feel something)
I wanna make you feel young (Feel young)
I wanna make you feel something
You know I wanna make you feel, I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel, I wanna make you feel
I wanna make, I wanna make
I wanna make, I wanna make you feel

[Verse 1: Aminé]
It's funny how I always find myself in Dakota
Knocking on my conscious every morning like Jehovah
I'm afraid of heights but my feelings roller coaster
So I'ma chug, chug
I'd like to pay the tab if you let me make a statement
But then she tell me "No" the same way they did David
Cabernet for my fitness sake
My confidence a raisin but I wish it was a grape
Holes in my soul 'cause I feel like Zero
Patch me up quick with a stitch like Lilo
Red wine like my red coupe, white girls want the proof
Jay Rock to a Kate Moss, get out
Fingers on the edge of my glass, making it last
Thinking about a girl from Portland all in my past
Got groupies fanning out like Dakota
But I'd rather get shy on my sofa

[Pre-Chorus: Aminé]
Baby girl, I've had one too many
My cup ain't full, but it's got me empty
Only drink to mingle 'cause I'm single
Waiter, can you break this 20?
I'm not about the flashiness, I'm only about you and this
Drink that's in my hand, has got this plan
And has got me wasted, got me faded

[Chorus: Aminé & Charlie Wilson]
I wanna make you feel young (Feel young)
I wanna make you feel something (Feel something)
I wanna make you feel young (Feel young)
I wanna make you feel something
You know I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel
I wanna make you feel
I wanna make
I wanna make
I wanna make
I wanna make you feel

[Bridge: Aminé]
Compassion ain't a man's best friend
But it's somewhere next to his pride
Illuminate the bullshit and give him some time

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Gazing at the bottom of my glass
Searching for an answer to mistakes from my past
I ain't been to Saturn and I ain't been to Mars
I haven't met Elon but I have met a star
It's hard to relish how I really feel about you
Like my niggas, my feelings is really, really out here
I cry with my hands up high
Just so I can get by when I truly feel alone
I see the fire
In your eyes I wonder if this is real or if I'm underwater
Dark nights, light hearts, cold face
It makes you want to see what we could have become
But everything's meant to be
