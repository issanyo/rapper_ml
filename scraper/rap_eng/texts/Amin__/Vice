[Hook]
All I ever want is just a little more liquor in my cup
(more drink, more drink, more drink, more)
All she ever wants is just a little more weed in her blunt
I be, I be on my cool though ...

[Verse]
I believe the fire in your eyes
Yeah its time for me to come and slide
Yeah I seen the devil in your eyes
Tell me what it takes to feel alive
Yeah I seen the hate, I seen the divide
Ain't no compromise, we just multiplying
Numbers never lie
Strength in numbers
I ain't ever been a back seat boy
Listening to Blackstreet in the back seat
Where niggas will pack heat
Well thats where facts be
I be where the blacks be
Summertime khaki
Only time I get jiggy
Time we get busy
Cos...

I dont fuck with niggas
That be acting like they do know
What the hell is going on
But really that ain't true though
(that ain't true)
That ain't you though
That ain't true though
You ain't ever really in a cut
Cos you ain't cool bro

I believe the fire in your eyes
Its time for me to come and slide
To fuck, divide and fuck the tide
And you been wasting
Being racist face it I ain't changing nigga

[Hook]
All I ever want is just a little more liquor in my cup
(more drink, more drink, more drink, more)
All she ever wants is just a little more weed in her blunt
I be, I be on my cool though...
Its how we do though
I be on my cool though
Its how I, its how I
I be on my cool though
On my cool yeah
What you talking about?


[Verse 2: Aminé]
Blow a young nigga like Akon
Says she loves Frank and napalm
Shorty ain't drunk, she's J-Kwon
But never will I ever put a cape on
West Side nigga we don't save hoes
Well we do, sometimes
Tryna bag something in this club tonight
And Aminé got the juice in the cryptonite (hahahaha, you so crazy)
Things look better when I'm drunk (True)
Try to stay sane like a monk (Eh)
Drink her when I drink some (Ey)
Why life gotta be so hard?
Why my bills gotta be so high?
C.L.B.N when she D.M me and all
My friends just to get likes(hey)

[Hook]
All I ever want is just a little more liquor in my cup
(more drink, more drink, more drink, more)
All she ever wants is just a little more weed in her blunt
I be, I be on my cool though...
Its how we do though
I be on my cool though
Its how I, its how I
I be on my cool though
On my cool yeah
Get it on, this what we do
What you talking about?

[Outro]
All I ever wanted was a little more liquor in my cup
And all she ever wanted was a little more weed in her blunt
All I ever wanted was a little more liquor in my cup
And all she ever wanted was a little more weed in her blunt
