[Verse 1:]
What's up
It's NÃ©
I talk my weight
If you don't know
I'm from west coast
Momma worked more OT
Than them kicks you see on Kobe
Daddy's life is slippin'
Cause he used to smokey smokey
Scholarships are trippin'
Got no mothafuckin' money
Plus I'm always late to class
Oh Lord help me pass
Never did these bitches right
Did these bitches right
I just hope these niggas treat my little sister right
Oh the irony
Oh the irony
Lord forgive me for all of my tendencies

[Hook]
I said I know
Oh yes I know
You put me on Earth for a reason
But can I know
Can I know
What's the reason
Oh what's the reason
My emotions
Got me feelin' like I
Don't know myself
My devotion got me feelin
So damn lonely
My emotions
Got me feelin' like I
Don't know myself
My devotion got me feelin
So alone

[Verse 2:]
So many things that I've been thinkin' bout'
The pills, the rent, the checks, my ex and all my fuckin' owns
Oh yes I run it now
I'm trynna figure out what my purpose is
Oh what's my purpose
Purpose
Feelin' mundane on this Monday
Shots to the head got me feelin' insane
I'm rollin through commotion
While I'm soakin' in emotions
The doctor tell me that I need some extra pills of lovin'
So what do I do
I tell my girly bible
And then she just gets her bible
And pray to the Lord for my sins
Then I think about my loses and my wins

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
Oh me
Oh my
My emotions
Oh me
Oh my
My emotions
Oh me
Oh my
My emotions
Never compromise to survive
I'mma get this shit either if I die or I'm alive
White rag
White horse
White torch
I'mma end up on your screen if you like it or you don't
Never compromise to survive
I'mma get this shit either if I die or I'm alive
White rag
White horse
White torch
I'mma end up on your screen if you like it or you don't
