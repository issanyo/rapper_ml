[Intro]
Yeah
Hey!

[Chorus]
VVs on my pinky ring
It's right there like I'm Chingy man
Tell me who the fuck are you? (who the fuck are you?)
Bitch you know I do my damn thing
VVs in my pinky ring
It's right there like I'm Chingy man
Tell me who the fuck are you? (who the fuck are you?)
Bitch you know I do my damn thing

[Verse 1]
Ooh, (brrrrp) yeah, bodies on bodies on bodies
Saw that she called me, she said that she want me
I tell her come through and she leavin' the party
Taking it down, couple of rounds
Bitch I'm Amin√©, you know it's allowed
Checkin' my 'count, make sure it's right (true)
Spendin' it once and I'm makin' it twice (true)
Nigga who are you? (yuh) What's your avenue? (Yuh)
Oh you know so-and-so (whoo), okay, then you cool (brrrr!)
Silly me, silly me, you don't know this luxury
Pussy tastes like sorbet, Tee-WaTT, I need more bass (yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
VVs on my pinky ring (true!)
It's right there like I'm Chingy man
Tell me who the fuck are you? (who the fuck are you?)
Bitch you know I do my damn thing
VVs in my pinky ring (yeah)
It's right there like I'm Chingy man (yeah)
Tell me who the fuck are you? (who the fuck are you?)
Bitch you know I do my damn thing

[Verse 2]
At the hotel, and I'm chillin'
This year alone, I made me a couple million (racks)
Pay me like the movies do (yuh)
Heaven sent like Charlie's boo (whoo)
Bad bitch look like Lucy Liu (true)
We could make a movie too
Okay okay (yuh yuh), okay okay (yuh)
In my face like Cena so this mula be my soulmate (true)
Tuition in my mouth, your check on my neck (yuh)
Phone off you can't locate, Tee-WaTT, I need more bass
