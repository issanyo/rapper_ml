[Verse 1]
Silly motherfuckers wanna doubt me
Well, that's cool with me
I never let them haters talk around me
Save the bullshit for your USB
How you mad at mad decent, fuck is you meanin'?
Commitment ain't no joke, that shit ain't got leases
Decisions, decisions whether it pull up or whether it miss 'em
Fuck it
Deuces I'm tuckin'
All of them niggas, they bitches, they bluffin'
Suc-cess, I part seas like I'm Moses
And when it come to talent, yes I do possess
(They don't lie)
I really am, a motherfuckin' killer better get it on cam
Jealous of your friends so you act like you friendly
Even if you in Vegas you never see the envy.
Ethiop king, mama she said
Every solo man got a little highlid
Word, my pussy's better you need to center
Hate it when they talk about themselves to feel better

[Pre-Chorus]
Concealed, come see the pros
Never mention cons 'cause you hate 'em on the low
She bomb.com, but she probably a hoe
But then again I'd probably hatin'
Let's get to singin' uh

[Chorus]
You think I'm crazy
I don't deserve ya
And that I'm lazy
I'm such a monster
You probably will never get around
To let me defend myself, so when I'm singing to you now like
Yeye, yeye, oh-alright girl
Yeye, yeye, oh-okay girl
Yeye, yeye, oh-alright
When ya all up in my ear
I'm singin' yeye all night
(Like)

[Verse 2]
Respect, get my feet wet
If a nigga got a problem hit him with a reflex, bitch I'm
Fly like a sea jet
So I don't joke around, bitch
No, I ain't Heath Ledger, look
I'm a fiend to the rap, but the rap make a fiend
If your flow too dry, I'll prescribe vaseline
I'm the newest motherfucker on the motherfuckin' scene
He said no way, way
I said yeyeye

[Bridge]
It's west side 'til I die
Can I flex out in my ride?
It's west side
It's west side
It's west side 'til I die
Bitch, it's west side 'til I die
Can I flex out in my ride?
It's west side
It's west side
It's west side 'til I die
Rep

[Verse 3]
Do you D-I-E if you R-I-P?
The questions I ask when I'm in too deep
The moment you laugh is the moment I leave
There's no time for jokes, man
I call what I see

[Pre-Chorus]
Concealed, come see the pros
Never mention cons 'cause you hate 'em on the low
She bomb.com, but she probably a hoe
But then again I'd probably hatin'
Let's get to singin' uh

[Chorus]
You think I'm crazy
I don't deserve ya
And that I'm lazy
I'm such a monster
You probably will never get around
To let me defend myself, so when I'm singing to you now like
Yeye, yeye, alright girl
Yeye, yeye, okay girl
Yeye, yeye, alright
When ya all up in my ear
I'm singin' yeye all night
(Like)
