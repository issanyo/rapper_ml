[Verse 1: Aminé]
Pass me the lighter
Old flame callin' so she wanna light the fire
Now I'm super tired
When we get together, room sound like a choir
I'm a true lifer
Pussy make me happy and it make me inspired
Forget to read on my Bible
Go through these cycles, so...

[Chorus: Aminé]
I was up in the night
It never was known
I wanted to try
But I wasn't sure
My life was a lie
I filled it with gold
There wasn't a night
Where I wasn't sure

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Now pass me the lighter
Old flame callin' so she wanna light the fire
Now I'm super tired
When we get together, room sound like a choir
Yeah, I'm a true lifer
Pussy make me happy and it make me inspired
Forget to read on my Bible
Only God know why I go through these cycles

[Chorus: Aminé & Ty Dolla $ign]
I was up in the night
It never was known
I wanted to try
But I wasn't sure
My life was a lie
I filled it with gold
There wasn't a night
Where I wasn't sure

[Verse 3: Aminé]
Shit, bitch I'm dripped in gold (woo)
Young lil' nigga with a 40 old soul (true)
Pop that trunk if that ass look cold (cold)
Made my money, never sold my soul (ayy)
I'm André's prodigy, can't find a hotter me (no)
If a nigga try to stop me I'ma tell him I'ma eat (ayy)
Comma, comma, comma, commas comin' pretty commonly
If I'm being blunt, I really wanna fuck Emily (hey)
Bitch, I'm missin' your call
I don't got time for your problems at all (no)
I'm poppin' and all so she poppin' it off
I turn the other cheek, now she kissin' my jaw
So sick with it, (sick) fuck my critics (yeah)
Smile so hard like I love my dentist (teeth)
I'm that chemist, I serve it to the fiends (yeah)
Quit my 9 to 5, now I'm 95 degrees
Destined for my destiny
I sow no hate or jealousy
Niggas feel me like Hennessy
And if it's good for you
Then it's good for me (true)
Destined in my density
I only show love or empathy
'Cause karma dictates my legacy
And if it's good for you
Then it's good for me

[Outro: Ty Dolla $ign & Aminé]
Gotta, always gotta keep it real with ya (true)
Even though you in your feelings
Know we've been goin' through a lot lately
But you know you're still my baby
Aminé always gotta keep it real with ya (true)
'Cause you know that they're hearin' us (yeah)Caroline, yeah, that's my baby (ayy)
But you know that she drives me crazy
And you love when I kiss it in the mornin'
You know it's real when we kissin' all in public
Now she floorin', two toned foreign (yeah)
Shawty love to tan so she lookin' like she orange
