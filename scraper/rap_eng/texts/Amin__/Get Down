[Verse 1:  Aminé]
Said she want ring and a white picket fence
Suburbia for her nervia
I couldn't live that life
So thats why I'm here with you tonight
I-I don't know if you're interested
But I do know that you can have my kids
Excuse me if I'm a little too forward
I'm just wanna hit it from the backward
Ain't this awkward
I can't believe I said that
Oh my ain't she a bad gal
Oh gal how you do that


[Hook: Aminé and Emily Libera]
Get down get down
Get down down down
Get down get down
Down down
Baby I don't want to love
I just want to live in the moment
Baby I don't want to love
I just want to find someone
And get down
Have fun get down
Have fun get down
Have fun
We can get it on til' the mornin'
Get down have fun
Get down have fun
Get down have fun
Get down have fun
We can get it on til' the mornin'


[Verse 2: Aminé]
Hibbie jibbies
I didn't know you was freaky deaky
I just thought you was goodie goodie
Now you got me like
I don't want none of them girls
I'm an N.E.R.D. Girl that's Pharrell
When it comes to ya booty that mass appeal
Even Rita couldn't fuck with your Ora
Curves like the hills
So I call you Mrs. Lauren
You so damn pretty girl
Plus you're so-so minimal
Say you wanna have some fun
So lets get physical

[Hook: Aminé and Emily Libera]


[Verse: Aminé and Emily Libera]
Do you wanna love anymore?

No,no, no

Do you wanna fuck anymore?

Baby we can get it on til' the mornin'

What about love?

What about trust?

What about us?

What about lust?
And I'm starin' at your eyes like
I'm tryna' get this figured out

And it ain't hard to figure out boy
I got you all figured out

I gotta catch a plane
A jet, a cab I gotta go

Anywhere you want babe
As long as I can go

[Outro: Aminé and Emily Libera]
