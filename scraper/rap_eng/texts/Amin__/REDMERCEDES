[Pre-Chorus]
With my niggas in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck you, pay me
Rolling deeper than Adele when we go out
If the ladies show up, then we show out
With my girl in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck me, baby
Leather seats so she wetter than a pool now
When that thing go up then she go down

[Chorus]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type

[Verse 1]
Wood grain Nada, yes I'm the Baba
Don't rock Prada, what's a stylist
I'd rather make my clothes, merch by the boat load
Banana club popping, yep I'm super biased (true)
Tint so black, look like my complexion
Neo I'm the one like I had direction
Rims look like they were shipped from heaven
Trunk so big it could fit my reverend (yeah!)
And that nigga's pretty big
Engine so fast, every block is a trip
Baby girl wished that I copped the two seater
But I had to get five 'cause my niggas want to ride

[Pre-Chorus]
With my niggas in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck you, pay me
Rolling deeper than Adele when we go out
If the ladies show up, then we show out
With my girl in my red Mercedes
Attitude like fuck me, baby
Leather seat so she wetter than a pool now
When that thing go up then she go down

[Chorus]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type

[Verse 2]
Looking out my rearview, all I see is haters (hatin')
This is just a preview, I'll use my gas for later (maybe!)
Black ice, black seats, yeah I'm bumping Blackstar
Rednecks tell me that I got a nice car
Gotta make sure that I keep my baby clean
This game keep me hungry like I'm Katniss Everdeen
Just got the whip washed
Shining like it's pish-posh
Engine sound like it needs an ad-lib from Rick Ross
No I ain't M.M.G
But my next purchase might be an M3 (sheesh)
Sicker than most, look at the folk
Trippin for dollars so holler for gold
Picking apart my problems
Like when Peter Piper picked his nose
Whip looked like it got dipped in a cherry coat
Mercedes' same color as the hair on a Lil Boat (Lil Boat)

[Chorus]
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
This shit so clean, I put that on my life
Red Mercedes beam, it's a different type
