[Intro: Aminé]
Yah-yah, yah-yah
Yah-yah, yah-yah
Whoa
Yah-yah, yah-yah
Yah-yah, yah-yah

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I woke up on this Sunday
With no motivation in my body
No, whoa, whoa, whoa
Phone drier than Mojave
Daddy diabetic, so he eat his pancakes with agave
Mama headed to the church now
And she left me at the house
She left me at the house
Religious but I'm lazy
Naked like a nudist
Fruity Loops and Stanley Kubrick
Peanut butter jelly
Cousin bumping Makaveli
Sipping Stellas with my fellas
Bumping nothing but Fela Kuti
Groupies say they wanna do me
Truly, that feel like a blessing
But finding one to love is getting harder every second
Niggas would rather be single than see a wedding date
Niggas will either end up at Heaven or at Kevin's gates
I bench press my problems, like add another weight
And act like it's alright when it's not, whoa

[Chorus: Aminé]
Some days we get Sundays but most days the rain comes down
And I feel like I'm bound to drown
Jesus Christ, whoa
Truth is my religion
My beliefs are not forgiven
Some days we get Sundays but most days the rain comes down
And I feel like I'm bound to drown
Jesus Christ, whoa
Truth is my religion
My beliefs are not forgiven

[Verse 2: Aminé]
I've been sipping red wine since a toddler
Blood of Christ, sacrifice for my Father
My daddy love me and hate me like Mr. Focker
My sister happy that I can afford Supreme
Mama called
She said "Don't worry 'bout me, baby, get your problems solved"
I told her "Ask me for whatever, whenever you want
I just went double platinum"
Mama say my health is more important than my album
I'm not loud, I'm Ethiopian rowdy
Sent my parents to Maui
Now they skin look like a brownie
Yo-Yo see me grind, Demitrius say he proud
My niggas lift me up, whenever I'm 'bout to drown
Fuck a Monday
I love my Sundays
I head to Costco and get a smoothie
Momma say count your blessings
So I did and now I realize who I am and who I'm not, whoa

[Chorus: Aminé]
Some days we get Sundays but most days the rain comes down
And I feel like I'm bound to drown
Jesus Christ, whoa
Truth is my religion
My beliefs are not forgiven
Some days we get Sundays but most days the rain comes down
And I feel like I'm bound to drown
Jesus Christ, whoa
Truth is my religion
My beliefs are not forgiven

[Outro: Leon Bridges]
Whoa
Sunday
Don't let him die
Don't let him die
Don't let him die
Don't let him die
