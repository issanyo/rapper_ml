[Intro]
When I'm all alone
And my world come crashing down
Do I know who knows me?
Truly, you not gon' fool me
Say, when I'm all alone
And my world come crashing down
Do I know who knows me?
Truly, you not gon' fool me

[Bridge]
God, I'm sorry for acting (ooh)
I am for real
I never meant to make my mama cry
I apologize, I'm truly sorry
I'm sorry for acting (ooh)
I am for real
I never meant to make my mama cry
I apologize, I'm truly sorry
Damn right, I'm truly sorry
Yeah right, I'm truly sorry
I apologize, I'm truly sorry

[Verse 1]
Took a lot of pills just to kill my emotions
And now I'm finna kill all the thrill in my notions
I took a lot of pills just to kill my emotions
And now I'm finna kill all the thrill in my notions
I needed all the pills for the thrill in my notions
A little bitty pill, Advil, Ibuprofen
I'm faded, mmm, I'm faded
I'm faded, I'm faded, I'm done, done
Yeah, I'm done, done

[Verse 2]
I'm not a tycoon
I'm not a wise dude
I'm not a perfect nigga, but I got the right mood
I know she wonders what just goes on in my head
She try to get to know me, but I rather fuck instead
See, sex is therapeutic for the lonesome
We rather be alone, but hormones just really want some
So I keep my hands to the sky, and my knees to the ground
And my sins hit the seas, I need holy water now
See: H, A, double P, Y
Is what I'm tryna find, but it always seems like
Somethin' tryna break me down, or pull me under
Callin' on my Brio, think I might have wrong number

[Outro]
I think I might have wrong number
Callin' on my Brio, think I might have wrong number
I keep callin' like every day of the week
I'm callin' on my Brio, think I might have wrong number
