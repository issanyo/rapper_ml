[Verse 1]
Yeah, bitch I'm back
I'm back again
I'm feeling good, better than I ever been
It's West side 'til a nigga D-I-E
And where I'm from
Mother fucka' 5-0-tree
I don't fuck with niggas who bitter
And back pedal, the fact is...you lame
Homie got a vendetta but never get it together
Your best friend insane
I'm looking at life in a different light
I'm a beast in disguise
Waking up this morning, I got crust in my eyes
Funny how the money make a nigga go blind
Subliminal shots
That be for kids
Look at the clock
I'm sick of my wrist
Shoutout to Meech
That's my nigga and shit
I call up Yos oh, yeah
We lit in this bitch
Iller than ill, sicker than sick
Ride for my dogs like a nigga Mike Vick
Who you know can rap like this?
You fucks with me like your first name Vick
My bars on freeze, that mean I'm cold, nigga you know
These (nuts) don't play around
TMI, TMI, but you notice now
I'm a beast, I'm a beast
I got money on my mind
If a nigga gotta eat, I'm better
Bet a nigga dine
When I'm talking to my brio
He said all I got is time
I'm a beast motherfucker
You can hear it in my lines like
