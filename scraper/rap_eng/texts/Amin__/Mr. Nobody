[Chorus: Aminé & Neka]
Mr. Nobody
Nobody knows who
Mr. Nobody
Nobody needs you
'Cause when you at the bottom
Ya feelin' real blue
And when you at the top they just all want you 'cause
When you in the gutter
And when you in the slums
They just tell ya Mr. Loser you already done
And when you at the top and you already one
They just tell ya man I knew that you would be the one

[Verse 1: Aminé]
I stop
And think for a sec
I really hustle hard but I feel like empty car
Oh
Nobody
And lord yes sir I'm sorry
I do respect ya plan but could ya help me understand
Me no Mr. Willy Wonka
Just give it to me proper
Don't sugarcoat it, let me know it
If ya think I'm loser
'Cause like mi familia, it's really all love
And sometimes I need a laugh when I'm really in the dumps

[Bridge: Neka & Aminé]
You might think
I'm no one
But to me
I'm someone
I know
Who I am
And who I be
Can't believe in themselves so they say this to me

[Chorus: Aminé & Neka]
Mr. Nobody
Nobody knows who
Mr. Nobody
Nobody needs you
'Cause when you at the bottom
Ya feelin' real blue
And when you at the top they just all want you 'cause
When you in the gutter
And when you in the slums
They just tell ya Mr. Loser you already done
And when you at the top and you already one
They just tell ya man, I knew that you would be the one

[Verse 2: Aminé]
Stop for a moment and realize who you are
Anything is possible and you could be a star
No matter what they say, no matter who they are
Use a living breathing being and can be anything you want
You put in work all day
I swear it pays off
Always
So now ya success can be back stress
Old friends callin' up like, "wassup"
Ya know Ii's funny how it always goes
People that did the least always want all the most
Hol' up, my old girl said I was a no one
Now that's my ex girl for a reason

[Bridge: Neka & Aminé]
You might think
I'm no one
But to me
I'm someone
I know
Who I am
And who I be
Can't believe in themselves so they say this to me

[Chorus: Aminé & Neka]
Mr. Nobody
Nobody knows who
Mr. Nobody
Nobody needs you
'Cause when you at the bottom
Ya feelin' real blue
And when you at the top they just all want you 'cause
When you in the gutter
And when you in the slums
They just tell ya Mr. Loser you already done
And when you at the top and you already one
They just tell ya man I knew that you would be the one
