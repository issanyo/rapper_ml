*Verse 1*
[Dru Down]
I know you see me doin a hundred 'n ten
And through the fin you can say
I'm a natural fiend, BOI!
Get On My Hype, ridin through lights
On a freshly-new-and-candy-painted
Sup'd up hot bike
And when I pass you all you see is ice
You freeze up from the breeze I leave
I'm cool like that
You should see me, look I'm passed you mack
I'm Dru Down, pimp hard the fact
It's Regime Gang

[Keak da Sneak]
Hello? B-bang, E-yes-yes
The best thing since Corn Flakes:
Keak Sneak and Messy
K-K-K-K-Kill you with what I say
Draw 'em Down like Dru
Like 40: In A Major Way (Major Way)
From Oakland, smokin' like Double R
Bootleggin' this'll lead to murder
Like some grams of tar
(SKKERRRRRT) In my scraper gettin' far
And this year I want a G for every bar
Get On My Hype

[Richie Rich]
I'm reppin' three P's: Pimps, Pills, 'n Purp
The rap game slow but it's still some work (still work)
Mess hit me said "Spill a verse"
My life, my Hype: still the Turf
Two chains and ten whips (ugh)
Two fully thangs and ten clips (yeeah)
Two stunnas and a plum sip
A small 1800 and a dumb whip

*Chorus*
[Messy Marv]
Yeah, Get On My Hype
Green Big Birds, yellow and blue Nikes
Money on the charm, yellow and blue ice
Stones on the arms, red and blue ice
(Get On My Hype)

Sideshow shit, the West on fire
If she ain't a piece, I'll run right by her
On some hyphy shit, sideways two tires
I'm on one homie
But I'm tryin' to Get On My Hype

*Verse 2*
[Left]
Come home across that bridge
To my little city better known as The Ridge
Yep right off the 80 is where I live
Where the drama never dies
Get On My Hype
Who am I? My name is Left, nice to know ya
You are in the presence of a Frontline soldier
Aten Hut, salute the General
To earn them stripes now Get On My Hype
(yeah)

[Clyde Carson]
We still tryna see what it doo (see what it doo)
The Team, Team back in the booth (back in the booth)
Got, grippahs of weed, gel and blue
They say they love The Team, shit we love 'em too

[Kaz Kyzah]
Aight go back for kill (back for kill)
Then back for mo' (back for mo')
A pocket full of y'ills and a half of 'dro
White cranberry ‘cardi Razz or O
415, 510 Get On My Hype

[Turf Talk]
Check my profile
All these new rappers rap about my lifestyle ('bout my lifestyle)
And my pen stay low
Turf in the V.I.P. not on the dance flo' (not on the dance flo')
Pa'tna listen to the dialogue
Even if I’m filthy rich
I ain't buyin' out the bar (I ain't buyin' out the bar)
Two-piece 'em
Some rappers don't want me on their album 'cause I'd eat 'em

*Chorus*
[Messy Marv]
Yeah, Get On My Hype
Green Big Birds, yellow and blue Nikes
Money on the charm, yellow and blue ice
Stones on the arms, red and blue ice
(Get On My Hype)

Sideshow shit, the West on fire
If she ain't a piece, I'll run right by her
On some hyphy shit, sideways two tires
I'm on one homie
But I'm tryin' to Get On My Hype

*Verse 3*
[E-40]
(YEE!)
There was a young player by the name of 40 Water (40 Water)
And hustlin' was this young playa's game (game hustlin')
P-I-M-P-Y, P-I-M-P-Y
Tycoonin' (coonin'), gas breakin' an' dippin'
She says "block strippin's gonna pay my college tuition"
I said my pa'tna that's Mike Jones, but I ain't tippin' (I ain't tippin')
How do you want it:
Doggy style or the fetal position? (or the fetal position?)

[Guce]
Kings of Cali, we handle, what iz it? (what IZ IT?!)
I don't really think they want tha bidness mayne
Get On My Hype with some hustle there, don't be scared
If you're usin' meth baby that's the boys right there
Place your bets homeboy, you can't believe that (yeahh)
You might see me ridin' up third in a Maybach (skerrrt)
Yeah you notice that, young Guce a boss (boss)
The next time I might burn up ya block in a Porsche
WHAT!

[Messy Marv]
Okay, I don't play that pimpin'
If you ain't thizzin' well say that pimpin'
You know, some suckas won't like this
I'm runnin' red lights, hittin' corners wit my white chick
Yeah, and you should see my Asian
I'm just tryna pimp it with the federal agents
You know, it's stones on the wrist watch
Money on the ankles, two skittles and my trick watch

*Chorus*
[Messy Marv]
Yeah, Get On My Hype
Green Big Birds, yellow and blue Nikes
Money on the charm, yellow and blue ice
Stones on the arms, red and blue ice

Sideshow shit, the West on fire
If she ain't a piece, I'll run right by her
On some hyphy shit, sideways two tires
I'm on one homie
