[Hook]
I buy some blow then it better be great
So on you'll never relate
Hard to know how much cheddar we made
Cause there's cocaine on the president's face
You wanna see the Feds run in my place?
I ain't scared I got my gun on my waist
It's hard to know how much money we made
Cause cocaine cover up the president's face

[Verse 1: Dru Down]
You can have it in a franklin or a washington
Powder on my nose celebrity im popular
Im keepin the blow I gotta go I make a MOB move
NAH! Everybody can't do what i do
Im a nigga from the streets 'N i run with the beats
Just a pimp from the East, thats Oakland nigga!
Im a nigga dat'll creep, 'N dat'll roll deep
Cause I carry big heat, When i'm smokin' nigga!
Stuck 'n supa high you actin all funnyYou be off that sawdust
Cut plain DUMMY(dummy dummy)
Funny nigga i laugh cuz i been watchin
Locked up out now still niggas be talkin
Get ya money yah, powder for a rich nigga
Powder off a brick, on a bitch I PIMP nigga!
Makin money im fast just like a money counter
I got bricks but love ta leave the powder in the dollar!

[Verse 2: The Jacka]
I'll never be invited to the President's place
But get indicted just for tryna keep my residents laced
Im excited eatin bison or a liberty steaks(?)
And that's a yacht bout to dock with cocaine in our plates
I pour a five in a pops sippin' lean for the taste
One cup'll knock you out like a brick to the face
But this coke will wake you up like a clip in your face
I'm gettin' stoned on the stove turnin' kicks into base
Real niggas show me love when I visit they states
Gave us drugs and guns so our visits were safe
Turn the club up when I enter the place
If you test a thug that'll be the end of your life
We the illest niggas cause we remember the life
2001 we was sendin' them ice
Filled them young bulls up then we send 'em on flights
We got back with the guap and bought what ever we liked

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Joe Blow]
Just copped me some blow time to give it a taste
Sniffin' grams of that clam off the president's face
Us blacks came a long way you see the president's race
Surveillance cameras and hammers control my president's state
Thirty bands in my pants finna get a connect
Then whip a hammer on his ass and make him give me the rest
Major coke just make a quote and I can get it for less
I'm catchin' bodies till Illuminati pay they respect
I've been patient tryna make it now i'm finally free
And diggin' deep tryna find me every time that I speak
I looked at everybody around me and now I finally see
The bigger picture is gettin' richer not just grindin' for sneaks
We was all young and dumb even shot at police
Now i'm scared my son havin' bad karma from me
Until then i'm in my Benz while i'm thumbin' through cheese
You really appreciate the come up when you come from these streets
