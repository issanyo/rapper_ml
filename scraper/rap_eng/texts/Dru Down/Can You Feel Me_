[Intro]
Hmmm huh huh...

Yeyah...
It's Dru Down baby
Yeyah..
Comin straight from that izno...
A.K....
No play...
Matta fact...
Listen to my... baby

[Hook]
Can you feel me?
I said I'm doin' what I gotta do, stayin' true to tha crew
Can you feel me?
I said I'm deep down and dirty, I grew up hella early
Can you feel me?
I said I fantasize about tha dreams, havin' big fancy things
Can you feel me?
I can still remember when I stole my first diamond ring

[Verse 1]
O.K., I'm deep down and dirty
You heard me before
But I'mma kick this shit
Like I be kickin' in some front doors
Now po-po or 5-0
Straight on that real
Always been real
Fifteen blocks down tha
Street from that feel
But still see
Niggas have got it wrong
That po-po is 5-0
And that is my ho
Come and see me some time
Bust a rim and bust a rhyme
After that I fucked that Remy
Bust a rhyme and get a dime
And lets smoke, choke
Until the break of dusk
Fuck that bitch dawn
And puttin' a penny in my palm
Understand this
I rolls deep in tha five
I've been down with tha five
I gets dirty in tha five
And do a hoo ride. (Why?)
That is tha question
Devils be guessin'
Don't question, stressin'
Livin' in tha ghetto
Hello!
Ya betta hear me
And if ya don't
Ya betta really try to feel me...

[Hook]

Momma always told me
It'd be days like this.
So I took myself to Traders
Bought myself a fo-fifth
And some clips
Shit was gettin' hectic
Check this nigga's try ta wrecka
Veteran etcetera
And I bet ya ya life has never been a taken like, I'm deep down and
Dirty early
But see Pearly
At tha age of three
Took my ass in
Beause my momma was deceased
I still ended up a with tha gangsta
Comin' from tha street
Talkin' mentality, causin' casualties
Don't be mad at me
I'm D.D., pimp playa O.G.,
Born up in tha city of tha O.A.K.L.A.N.D
Ghetto-bound hustla, no sucka, serious about my bussiness
What is this? Now dig this, I overnite became rich
I'm me, not tha ordinary nigga from tha street
Grew up, threw up, to what I wanted to be, and what I sing...

[Hook]

It didn't matta my money was gettin' low, I'm on tha struggle
Whatever a nigga go fo, he gots me on tha double
But solo, cause niggas be bitches and snitches at tha same time
But I'm, a go and get my nine
And find these niggas who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to
These bitches, these bitches who be talkin' a hell of a lot a to these
Niggas who be riggas, but I'm a go and hit and do a diggum smack
And take to yo' ass back to tha future
Smoke super, I'm rollin' in tha six eight Couger
A Ruger, a mastermind like Lex Luger
It ain't no thang, like a chicken wing
With a waffle from Roscoe's, our mission
Is never impossible. Not fo me see, so fuck that old series, you stuck
On that screen I laugh, I'm over mescaline. Aha ha ha.... I see a
Dream as a triple beam, with hella dough from a mutha fucka, with no
Cut bro...

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeyah...
Can you feel me?
D.D....
Grew up, threw up, to what I wanted to be and what I sing

Can you feel me?
Can ya, can ya...
That's what I want fo you to feel me....
