[Intro]
Ain’t no stoppin’ Dru Down, he’s on the go

[Verse 1]
To the tip, to the top, tiggy top, I can’t be stopped
Listen—I think I hear a knock at the front door
Who is it? (It’s me, mayne, Money Green)
I open the door, I see some C-N-O-T-E
S, oh yes, it’s on, I’m signing on the dotted line
And ain’t stoppin’ like Freddy, this here is primetime
I’m on the come up, been on the come up ever since
I hit a lick and hit more than just one fence
I mean, so fast, I’m like quick to dash, I’m out
Don’t pout, it happened to me before, so cut it out
It’s an everyday thang and it’s going down
I’m from the Eastside, straight from the Oaktown
I found, myself on a ladder climbing a big wall
But soon that big wall just gotta take a fall
‘Cause I’ll be damned if I keep climbing and ain’t getting nothing
Or should quit, start back the grind and make a little something?
But do you care? I know you don’t, but I do
I’m tryna get me a ticket, legitly coming wicked
So furthermore, quit the mean muggin’, stop plottin’
Ain’t no stoppin’, ain’t no stoppin’

[Chorus]
Ain’t no stoppin’ Dru Down, he’s on the go
To the tip, to the top, tiggy top, I can’t be stopped
You think I can? Well, let’s rehearse again

[Verse 2]
I thought you knew I’m from the West Coast suburbs of
Eastside Oaktown, and fool, I be gettin’ down
On any track that’s thrown at me
I’m rippin’ it up because I be the bomb, let alone the beat
It’s like I snatch, dip, swerve to the curb
I wouldn’t hit it, I ain’t wit’ it, bendin’ my gold thangs
Dayna Dayne, I’m making ‘em bounce up and down
No switches, ‘cause coming from the O, we use the power steering
It’s so damn cool to me
Being born in the East O, everybody loves me, so
I’m taking a trip riding in my thang, I’m back
I’m going again, but first let me get a bigger bud sack
And let me do what I do then I’m done
When I’m done, I got a couple G’s to F’ off for fun
Well, all aboard, girlfriends
I’m in the wind doing 110, and ain’t no stoppin’
Ain’t no stoppin’ Dru Down
You feel him, you feel me, now peep it
Just like he said, it ain’t no stoppin’, I’ma keep on poppin’
The number one rule for slugs is they’re too quick to jockin’
I’m back again, breezy in the wind
Not off of that gin, fool, but off of that Hen-do
A major factor born to be the mack of the year
I haves no fear ‘cause ain’t no Captain-Save-a-dookie-booty here
I’m all about my money, my skrilla, my loot
Carry, a parachute in case a brotha fall off the top of the roof
But ain’t no fallin’, doesn’t run in my blood
I walk on my tippy-toes with a gangsta strut, and uh
Livin’ the life we livin’ by the unforgiven
That’s me, the capitalized double D, can’t you see
That ain’t no stoppin’ me, no no no no

[Outro]
Ain’t no stoppin’ Dru Down
It ain’t no stoppin’ me, the capitalized double D, you see
Ain’t no stoppin’ Dru Down
I thought you knew, fool, the capitalized serial killer double D
In effect one more time, the D in effect one more time y’all
I’m in effect one more time for the crew
I thought you knew, it’s C-Note Records, fool, yeah
