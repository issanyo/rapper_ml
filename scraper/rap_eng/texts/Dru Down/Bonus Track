[Intro]
What’s up, miznan? Driznu Diznown, miznan
I seen Tiznask all in front of the house, miznan
A nigga was triznippin’, man—what happened?

[Verse 1: Dru Down]
I woke up and started my morning with beef, hash, and coffee
I thinking about this rookie ass cop named McCarthy
They keep on jackin’—oh, is there a problem, sir?
I know there’s not, so what the fuck did you stop me for?
That’s the type of shit I’m talking right there
A lame ass cop a pumpin’ nursery fear
Take the badge and the belt off, huh, and get a sawed off
And blow your muthafuckin’ head straight off
Now, I’m running from the po-po’s, get in front of
I’m jettin’, getting quicker ‘cause I’m gonna, dip
A devastating leap over the fence
I hit the ground and the right and commence
To put my muthafuckin’ after-burners on
After me, he hit the fence but I’m gone
He stomped his feet, he’s getting angry, saying “Damn!”
About this time, I’m in the Cougar with the slam
I see these silly dilly daffy duckin’ bitches
They’re my potnas but they wanna ride to Bridges
I said “okay” and them in and what the fuck
One light, one dark, and both with big butts
But soon I pulled away from the curb
The Task was on my ass, there go my nerves
I’m getting jittery but the hoes couldn’t see
I had a stack in my drawers worth a G
I made a move and when I did, there goes the siren
But what do you know, the bitches out my roof firing
A gunshots through the window to the head and now they’re dead
And I don’t give a fuck about the punk wonder bread
So ya see, it was a job well done
Congratulated the hoes with the drank and bomb, huh
We hit Bridges, dropped the hoes off immediately
And being the player that I am, I continue to be
I’m still riding as I shoot through the big Melrose
And muthafuckas getting jacked, stripped head to toe, bro
But what do you know, mayne, Dru Down is steady packin’
I got somethin’ when they keep jackin’, see

[Interlude]
Like that, miznan? (Yeah, fuck the police)
Now I’m finna introduce my potna Numskull from the Luni Tunz
Finna kick this jailhouse shit

[Verse 2: Numskull]
I just got out of muthafuckin’ jailhouse
I heard more stories than soaps that niggas tell before they bail out
Before I hit the first bullpen or holding
Cell, I heard more muthafuckas say that they was rollin’
Be sellin’ dope in the East
At least got fits, cars, bitches, and a couple of ki’s
Don’t do no homework in school but he passin’ still
One nigga said he fucked more bitches than Massengill
Got a bitch, 36, with a husband too
He don’t sell weight but you know that his cousin do
You need somethin’, he can get it, it’s all good, bro
Got hella scratch but no money on his books though
His mom’s rich ‘cause the bitch owns Nexxus
No, he’s not hungry but he’s the first to run for breakfast
Now he bragging about the shit that his kid has
And he said he smoked more weed than zig-zags
He takes a 40 to the face every morning
Swear up and down that the hoes, they be swarming
Around his ass ‘cause he famous
But to make shit worse, he even lies about what his name is
Now this was the whopper
Slut said he heard a nigga say he had a gold helicopter
Come on, that shit is wicked
Why these muthafuckas always lying just to kick it?

[Interlude]
With that jailhouse shit
Now I’m finna Yiznukmiznouth, the other Luni Tun
Tell ‘em how it is, man, when you finna hit that major lick

[Verse 3: Yukmouth]
Up on the late night, loading clips, holding shit to myself
About to jack this trick but he’s rollin’ thick
Thicker than my dick, so you know he’s livin’ phat
Plush ass Rolls Royce, a condo way in Sac
I’m saying that he tried to have me offed
And give it to boss, it didn’t work
And first of all, I know the muthafuckin’ turf
Just like the back of my hand, the man tried to pull the lick
Shot the four-fifth, fucked up good ‘cause he missed
I’m over the hills and through the woods at grandma’s house just plottin’
Niggas are mad because I got shit sewn like a stocking
His hoes jockin’, knots be walking fast past him
Because they know Yukmouth got the creamery for them
And M&M peanut can’t match up to the candy that we nuts
Got in the plastic bag stashed way in the cut
He must don’t know I know the hoe he fuck with
And I’m a nigga that can verify she suck dick
But uh, shit got deep, deeper than shit’s creek
As soon as the bitch beep, she gon’ tell me where the trick sleep
Then I’ma go pimp this old shit
And if you act bold, bitch, I’m letting off the whole clip
In your ass, in your kids’ ass, and if your black ass brother slip
I got another clip for his ass
Because the game is some real shit
Two dicks don’t click, but never try to play me like a little bitch
Nigga…

[Outro]
Yeah, C&H crew, you understand me?
Dru Down and Luni muthafuckin’ Tunz, yeah
Flow like this, somethin’ to ride to
