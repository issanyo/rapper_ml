[Intro: Dru Down]
It’s me, DD, ha, talk how you feel
Talk how you feel if it’s real
It’s me, DD (So whatcha sayin’, homie?)
Talk how you feel; talk how you feel if it’s real

[Verse 1: Dru Down]
Freedom of speech, that’s how I speak, it ain’t no punkin’ out
And ain’t no punk in me, the capitalized double D
But now I’m off track, let’s step back and get to the realness
My words might hurt, that’s what I want for you to feel this
And as I speak, lean back, relax, fire up
That boo bomb, that chron chron, that major skunk, punk
And feel high, like the clouds up in the sky
No tricks played, ‘cause you don’t wanna mess up a brotha’s day
What’s on my chest, I’m speaking it loud like I’m possessed
What’s next? Time to flex, grab my Tec and straight plex, sucka
I got the feeling, ain’t no punk as sexual healing
I’m getting further ‘cause I spinned the wheel and took a deal
And now I’m major, got the hoes just blowing up my pager
They want a job, they wanna work, here goes my wages
Everything under tuck up under the table
I’m able, to give you really more than what you’re capable
But I’ma talk just how I know, just how I feel
It’s me, the double D from the Town, on the real

[Chorus: Dru Down]
Talk how you feel, hold your nuts in your hands
Girls, grab your tits and say, “We don’t give a damn”
Talk how you feel, hold your nuts in your hands
Girls, grab your tits and say, “We don’t give a damn”

[Verse 2: Dru Down]
That’s real, talk how you feel, don’t be no mizark
And if it gets further than that, the sun goes down, it’s diznark
I’m making my team speak, the only thing they speak is heat
You wanna feel? Well, here’s some heat into your Levi jeans
Oh I, want you to understand that I
Slam like Bamm Bamm, tax hoes like Uncle Sam
Purified like water, but um, don’t ask your daughter
‘Cause she’s doing things she never did before for me
Slangin’ that ass from door to door, ya know
‘Cause that’s the type of hoe that I was into
Selling that ass, making that cash, and bringing it home to da-da, huh
But I’ma talk just how I know, just how I feel
It’s me, the double D from the Town, on the real…on the real

[Chorus: Dru Down]
Talk how you feel, hold your nuts in your hands
Girls, grab your tits and say, “We don’t give a damn”
Talk how you feel, hold your nuts in your hands
Girls, grab your tits and say, “We don’t give a damn”

[Verse 3: Dru Down]
Yeah, it ain’t no such thing as keeping your mouth shut when you’re talking
Vice versa, versa vice-a, alright-a
‘Cause funk straight jump when you’re on the corner
Drinking 40’s with your homies and you’re looking hella phony
Then a car pulls up—who could it be?
I grab my thang, pull it out, and back myself up 55th, that’s how I feel

[Verse 4: Numskull]
Yeah, but it lyin’ just to kick it no more
No gold helicopters, it’s hella choppers and more dough
Now everybody want their props
That’s why I watch Cops to see what brothas doing on other spots
Why not smarter, play the part-a, games’ll get you bucked
But your mouth’ll get you slugs if you corrupt—enough is enough

[Verse 5: Dru Down]
Oh yeah, I know exactly what you mean, Num Num
Here they come, them suckas that be lying just for fun
I won’t run, because I like to talk just how I feel
It’s me, the double D from the Town, on the real, yeah

[Outro]
You know just how I feel (How you feel, Dru Down?)
It’s like me on the wheel
You know I feel (Let me know how you feel, Dru Down)
Double D on the real
