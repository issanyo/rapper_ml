[Spoken Intro: Dru Down + female]
What’s up sweetheart?
Hi, baby
Yeah—how was that flight to the house?
And did you use that money that I gave you for a cab?
I did
It was a long journey, wasn’t it?
Uh-huh
Yeah, you played me though
Yeah, I did
You thought a brother didn’t have no mail, huh, but I did
You also thought a brother didn’t have no game, but I do
Now, I got a lot of that in me, but you gon’ make me put out envy
Check this out…

[Verse 1]
You shoulda said so, hoe, instead of playing with a brother
The shit was old you probably learned your great-grandmother
Playing the game like you was with it
You shoulda knew Dru Down was a player ready to go up in it
Calling me late last night saying you’re coming over
Catching a flight, 129 out of Minnesota
A young Black thick light-skinned Minnesota bitch
Catching a flight for Daddy Long, Mister Big Dick
I to think, mmm, okay, I thought it over
Come on through so I can bend it over
And I’ll be waiting, and as soon as you get here
I want service kinda quick and major fast, my dear
And then she said, “Okay, I’ma do you the proper way
Make it feel good so I can wake up in another day”
And ooh, I like that freaky talk shit
But talk is cheap, when you’re not working fat lips
She’s crossing the friendly blue skies just to get with me
She gets to the city and now there’s number one
Step number two, she’s at my house eating all my food
And step number three, she brought her son
Now do you think she was planning just to have some fun?
But to me, it was looking like she was moving in
She brought all her clothes but not a fuckin’ friend
But being a player that I am, I’ll be goddamned
She’s either giving up the kitty or find your way back to Pan-Am
‘Cause if it’s like that, you better let it go
‘Cause before you even came, you shoulda said so

[Chorus]
Round and round we go
You should let me know
You shoulda said so
Now I’m here with you
I don’t know what to do
You shoulda said so

[Verse 2]
Now do you think really, I’ma let the hoe get to me?
A fashion weighted by the style to looking kinda sexy
Fuck that, I ain’t with that, forget that
I’m gifted with the gift, black dick, and a contract
I know you couldn’t think you can do me like this, huh?
Sit on my couch, show legs, ass, and tits, shit
I coulda did a little bit more with my time
Like sit in the studio, write some super funky dope rhymes
But now you’re at my house playing couch potato
I started thinking real hard, she’s probably out for my mail
And like Double-R said, “mail means money,” hoes
Play that role on a muthafuckin’ gigolo
‘Cause if like that, I want legs spread, more head
Like a pro, ‘cause if not, you shoulda said so
You shoulda said so—big juicy lips

[Chorus]
Round and round we go
You should let me know
You shoulda said so
Now I’m here with you
I don’t know what to do
You should have said so
Round and round we go
You should let me know
You shoulda said so
Now I’m here with you
I don’t know what to do
You shoulda said so

[Verse 3]
Hey girl, you think I’m gonna play wit’cha?
You’re in my house half-naked eating food out my kitchen
And now you gotsta pay up, hoe
‘Cause I remember what you said nationwide on the telephone
So give it up, bend it over, put your son to sleep
So you can taste meat like a hot link
And give a brother like me plenty
I want your lips on my dick but you won’t get a penny
Of my money, honey
It ain’t funny, no you’re playing with your life like a dummy
I fuck around and hit a Tyson on your ass
And have your ass going home in a cab
And that’s far, I mean, hella far
Make your mind up, and spread your legs to a star
And if you ain’t with that, get out, jack
I’m known to be aggressive but player, I mean a big mack
So you’re not gonna pay up?
I’d be wrong if I said, ‘bitch, see ya later’
She said, “No, Dru Down, baby, I don’t wanna go”
I know, but before, you shoulda said so

[Interlude]
Yeah, Dru Down
Don’t ever come to my house like that, never again
I’ma give you the boot
(You shoulda said so…I don’t know what to do…you shoulda said so)

[Chorus]
Round and round we go
You should let me know
You shoulda said so
Now I’m here with you
I don’t know what to do
You shoulda said so
Round and round we go
You should let me know
You shoulda said so
Now I’m here with you
I don’t know what to do
You shoulda said so
