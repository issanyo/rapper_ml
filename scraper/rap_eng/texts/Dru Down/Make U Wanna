Oh yeah
Would you bounce with me?
Come on. Come on
Would you bounce with me?
Oh yeah
Whoo ohh I’m a a crazy guy

You make me wanna bounce like some hoes in the car
Make me wanna be the new superstar
You make me wanna live like I wanna live
Cuz I always wanted to be in showbiz
Every day got women glad to give me a kiss
Cuz now I’m off the streets and now I’m making them hits
You make me wanna just who I wanna be, and I gotta love you for it baby

You make a gangsta pimp feel good like Conrad
And If I can give you my gift, uh, you can have that
But only if I can keep it too
Cuz I’m cool like that, cuz I’m smooth like that, I pimpydo like that
Now give me my Dobb hat plus my Quarter left mink
Some people got more then I but it’s more than beats the eye
You can see me sometime I drink some Belve, bust some rhymes
If you know me that good I said that old rhyme from last time
Can you feel me?
That’s just a hit while I’m getting bent while I’m talking shhh...
I ain’t gon cuss though, not on this tip so, I’ma let her blow and let you know just how it go so..

You make me wanna bounce like some hoes in the car
Make me wanna be the new superstar
You make me wanna live like I wanna live
Cuz I always wanted to be in showbiz
Every day got women glad to give me a kiss
Cuz now I’m off the streets and now I’m making them hits
You make me wanna just who I wanna be, and I gotta love you for it baby

I love it when you sing that song full of that realness
Everybody knows the deal. Geah
I can’t stop this, the way I’m so versatile
And everybody think I’m more when I’m really dumb with a talent (and everybody think I’m old when I’m really young with a child)
“Oh you’re right”
I wouldn’t even have afford a condom (I wouldn’t even have him for a condom)
But now I know better, I’ll write them farewell letters
I got to get the cheddar
For him me and my peoples
Tryna be a protégé
Tryna have a holiday
A lil pimpydo-ism will have them tripping
On BET black entertainment a brother faming
Got dreams like Martin Luther King
Plus my muscle flex
As if I’m in the window like my old man

You make me wanna bounce like some hoes in the car
Make me wanna be the new superstar
You make me wanna live like I wanna live
Cuz I always wanted to be in showbiz
Every day got women glad to give me a kiss
Cuz now I’m off the streets and now I’m making them hits
You make me wanna just who I wanna be, and I gotta love you for it baby

Its ok baby to be like me and that’s a super star
But one thing you can’t be right now is a man with balls
I’ll be your women, work yo thing, do yo thing
Do it right, and when you do it think of me and who am I?
A crazy guy
With so much wisdom
I’ll make you have a orgasm
Not once but I can make them strictly random
Call me the late night prowler
The music phantom
See I like my women even when I ain’t did them
Even if it’s nothing baby it’s always something and that’s my motto
And no I didn’t get it on a bottle
Straight from the brain, to the throat, out the mouth follow
That’s just what you probably gotta love me for, hello!

You make me wanna bounce like some hoes in the car
Make me wanna be the new superstar
You make me wanna live like I wanna live
Cuz I always wanted to be in showbiz
Every day got women glad to give me a kiss
Cuz now I’m off the streets and now I’m making them hits
You make me wanna just who I wanna be, and I gotta love you for it baby (Love you baby)

Oh would you bounce with me? (Bounce)
Oh would you bounce with me? (Bounce)
Come on. Come on
Oh would you bounce with me? (Bounce)
Oh would you bounce with me? (Bounce)
Whoo ohh I’m a a crazy guy

(X2 Till Fade)You make me wanna bounce like some hoes in the car
Make me wanna be the new superstar
You make me wanna live like I wanna live
Cuz I always wanted to be in showbiz ( I wanna be in showbiz!)
Every day got women glad to give me a kiss

You make me wanna just who I wanna be, and I gotta love you for it baby
