[Intro: Stinj-E]
That boy Stinj-E (That boy Stinj-E)

[Verse 1: Dru Down]
Where you from, yeah, the Oakland city
Where the Bay so pretty, and the girls stay witty, chea
Get paper while the skys are grey, the leaves are brown
The trees is green, know what I mean? (What I mean?)
California dream, living it up, a dropped Stang
Dropped Chev, dropped Vette, dropped Cougar
Hard top Benz, hard wood floors, and a safe in floor
With a house full of whores, 'ight
Pimpy dude Dru, last name Down, never slow it down
Peeping through your town, hi hater
Fuck gators, sporting Louis and Gucci
A v-neck and your girl wanna do me (Me player)
Summer time weather, Spring or Fall, I stay fitted
Pimping cleaner than you all, I ball
I, stack chips like three times
I'mma push forward, look back when I rewind
Just because the sun shine out in Cali
Everything will go real ugly badly
Home of crime, plus good weather, plus I have a bad bitch on a nigga dick
I'm out to get a grip, chase the paper
Bread is butter, chicken is mother, I gotta eat dog
And the flow boy is slick as oil and your girl ear drum close cause beat is swole

[Hook: The Mamas & the Papas - California Dreamin' Sample]
All the leaves are brown (leaves are brown)(leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey
California dreaming (California dreaming)
On such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown (leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey
California dreaming (California dreaming)
On such a winter's day

[Verse 2: Berner]
California Kush and my cup so muddy
I'mma roll up and count drug money
I'mma send a bitch when my bread gets low
I'mma be here until it all gets sold
Red high heels with the see through panties
Pick a nick name, I'mma call her Candy
Girls get money cause I make them work
Tripple OG 'cause we played that purp
415, I'mma rep my city
My white girl's clean and she look so pretty
Forty-eight-hun for the purp with the color
Put it in a room with a bag full of rubber
I'mma get money until the day I die
Dope boy, dope boy, I'm so fly
I'mma light up when the cops roll by
Hash in the middle, I'm so high
California dream with the life of the star, what's the price of the car
I'mma go hard like a fight in the yard
I'mma get high and light my cigar
I'mma cash out if I like what I see, A1, cream
And I'm lying under the tree, I'm high as can be
I bet I'm right here getting paid
California, born n' raised

[Hook: The Mamas & the Papas - California Dreamin' Sample]
Brown (leaves are brown)(leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey
California dreaming (California dreaming)
On such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown (leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey
California dreaming (California dreaming)
On such a winter's day

[Verse 3: Lee Majors]
If you don't know about Cali then you must a nerd
Tires go flat when they catch that curb
Everybody know that we got the best herb
Call it screwed out, son, call it surp
Never seen snow but we got that Girl
Know about Thizz, then you know about Furl
Live the Thug Life, then you know about Pac
Candy on the old school, six-nine drop
No, it don't stop and it don't quit
Home of the players, pimps, hustlas', and that gangsta shit
All leaves brown while the skys are grey
You living out here for sunny days
Don't think it's all fun and games
Cause the crips n' bloods'll bang
Comin' out here tryna' steal our game
Going back home and you try and do the same
Don't give it back 'cause you squares are lame
You don't even know about Dangerous Dame
You don't even know about Cherry Pie
Talk about tree, you ain't ever been high
Come to the coast, baby, come to the Bay
Don't think it's all just L.A

[Hook: The Mamas & the Papas - California Dreamin' Sample]
Brown (leaves are brown)(leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey
California dreaming (California dreaming)
On such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown (leaves are brown)
And the sky is grey
California dreaming (California dreaming)
On such a winter's day
