[X2]You know, you know, you’re not alone
You know you’re not alone baby

It was the 1st time, eye to eye, my little butterfly
Caught my attention like a shooting star
Oh so very stunning you are
You’re like the gleam in my ring my precious, pretty thing
Make me feel good like when I’m playing maxed out or smoking trees
Or when I’m wearing a two peace, with the five button up
And no matter what I wear, we just like Sonny and Cher
Everywhere, just a pair looking good as can be
In and out of restaurants
In and out of clubs just you and me
Bottles of Cristal, being tipsy in the wee wee hours
We both looking out cuz we both know I’m MOBked out
You watch my bacc, I'll watch your spine
Matta fact I'll rub it
Like when I'm doggy style from behind, we both love it
Some of that good loving
You like it slow and all of a sudden, and I'mma give it to you like that and more
Never leave you with nothing
Ain't no fronting
Baby girl I love everything about you
And I'm falling major (And I'm proud he made you), plus I'm so glad I met and found you

[X2]You know, You know, your not alone
You know your not alone baby

[Pinky]
When I’m in the car, or whether on the plane
When I’m on the boat, or when I ride the train
Dreaming of me and you
Forever and always, and if you ever need a spot
I got a place for you to stay
No pressure, no strain, I got my own game
I’m the type of dame that will buy you a ring
Sound strange? Well it’s the truth
Got me open, hot and sweaty in this vocal booth
It’s kind of cute cuz we both got fame and loot
Cock back, aim and shoot
Time to blow the fucking roof
What you really wanna do?
Spark flames, scream each others names?
Cuz I’m too hot to tame, but I’m damn glad I came
To get to know you, it feels so nice
Inspired cuz you light up my life
As we lay at night
Gazing at the sun, moon and stars
Due Down and Pinky
Rolling something stinky

[X2]You know, You know, your not alone
You know your not alone baby

You must forgot how I knocked you
It was like sweeping you off your feet in a helicopter
So give me my prop-ers
You forgot I had to dock ya
Because of me making things popping
No stopping a grown man for making his profits
But baby I got ya
Over and over
Thought I told ya
Games and situtitions to get you out of
If you was in any type of trouble
I’ll be there on the double
Ready to rumble
Giving them Pow Pow
Cuz for my angel baby its like that

[Till Fade]You know, You know, your not alone
You know your not alone baby
