[Prologue]

Ah, there you go, blood, wha's up mane? Damn...
I just came through your house, man
Came looking for you, blood, man
I knocked onto your door, man
Your woman came out like she wanted to slug me with a bat or som'
Oh, like damn, cause I'm the prop or som', you know what I'm sayin', what's up
My grandma paged, I just wanted to call her back
I said "what's up", let me use her phone
She wouldn't even open the gate
She had that little kid
That little... She a danger
Try'na get me, you know what I'm sayin'
What's tha problem, what's all that for?
KMS, what's up man?
Why she trippin' like that, blood?
Why she doin' it like that?

[Verse 1]

I don't know
But just the other night or so
It was cool, like the beat, mellow and soft
I had to figure out a way to do this
I'll be the player that I am and change a woman to a misses
But to me, it's getting harder
Every time that I look, hey, the dream was getting further
Away from the memories that I have seen with her
From the first time we kiss, fool, I knew I wanted to be with her
I'm starting to panic, it's puttin' stress in my head
I'm laying down, thinking, got me tossin' and turnin' in bed
But what should I do, singin' at ya?
(Solve your problem with a bottle of E&J)
But then it wouldn't be like the word calm
Like it would be if I'm rolling up a twenty sack of bomb
Cause it's confusing cause the life that I'm pursuing is strange
You're going through the itty-bitty unnatural thangs

[Chorus]

No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one)
No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one, no one)

[Verse 2]

So I wonder, deep down into the thought of my head
Would you really be with someone that will kill you dead in bed
You never know, probably 'cause you thought
And speaking words like "nigga, what the hell you want?"
And now I'm back with a man's point of view
Don't speak to me that way cause I don't speak that way towards you
And let's say, the situation of violence comes up
What should I do, when my woman ain't a punk
Sometimes I'm scared to even leave the damn gun around
But I do, and now I'm sure that it's not to be found in the hands of a itchy-finger woman
She wouldn't do me as one, and number two: it wouldn't matter, fool
'Cause I be damned if I go for the joke so
Continue to keep things down on a lower level
But the things she thinks she knows, I already knew
Like no one's gonna love you, girl, like I do

[Chorus]

No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one, no one)
No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one, no one, no one)

[Verse 3]
Dru Down, break it
Check this out, I got it jockin' now

Now she's sweatin'
Dripping of the love steam
Thinking she's a loser, but no, she's on my winning team
But I couldn't understand the reason for the bad talks, sad walks
All the way around the old parks
Making up, taking up some of her time that we should spend before the lovestrings unwind
But I could never shed a tear in front of a woman 'cause that ain't mankind to shed a teardrop from my eye
And I know you feel me
But I'm happy that our love was found
And no one's gonna love you girl, like Dru Down

[Chorus]

No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one, oh yeah)
No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one)
No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one)
No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one, no)
No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one like I do, oh no)
No one's gonna love you like Dru Down (no one)
No one's gonna love you
