People wonder why they call me Dru Down
Well let me tell ya
Pull a gat so quick
Insane, your life ain't shit
Because I listened to your footsteps follow me
Of course I'm strapped with a gat so your creeping don't bother me
Cause once upon a time in the old school
I got robbed, jacked me by this old fool
But back then, J, I really didn't know no better
That's why I went home and grabbed the .25 Beretta
And ran there fast to the scene of the robbery
Knowing he wouldn't be there
But he's standing on the side of me!
Pop! Pop! I had to do him cause he did me
My name's Dru Down
You shoulda took it more seriously
Nigga, I'm just a playa from the Oak
So recognize game cause I'm a pimp
Also pimpin hoes
I say the bigger the better
Oh I would never
Be a player hater cause I'm a playa
Play ya major
But now I gets off so when it comes to shooting rounds
Well then you will know, punk
Why they call me Dru Down

See, you's a goddamn fool because I'm sick with the shit
I bust the punk off because I'm steady making licks
They call me Dru Down because I'm drawing on these suckers
Your pockets is long? Well let me make 'em a little shorter
Brace yourself! That's what I say when I'm pointing the chrome
Now whacha think I'mma say
When I'm running through your home?
Now picture: me and Ol' Black are running through your damn kitchen
I'll stuff you in the stove and bake your ass like some chicken
Cause I'm the crazy nigga that'll turn and do that shit
I'll make ya screamin' "Yeah!" while yet I'm sayin' "shut up, bitch!"
I finally realized that my name's "make me sick"
Sicka than what you get when you're lying in the cukoo nest
Now see, can you get
With the nigga Dru Down, straight full of it
And if you don't know me
You will know when you hit the town
There's a reason why they call me Dru Down

Dru muthafuckin Down for your ass, two-time
Coming for your mind

Earning the name Dru Down is kinda difficult
You wanna try to earn my name? Buy a gat and start shootin' fools
Cause to get my stripes I was no punk
I walked the streets in '89 with a gauge pump
But now it's '93 I got a new spot
I made it real hot
But went and bought me a brand new black Glock
Shooting motherfuckers in the leg
Pistol whippin suckas, hittin' em dead in the head
Cause I don't give a fuck, nor do I care less
But just to be aware I'm being strapped with a vest
Cause if I get caught on the sleep
I'll bet you motherfuckers wanna fill me with some heat
But I'm not going for it pull a fully, use all rounds
And then you will know, punk
Why they call me Dru Down

Three times for your motherfuckin' minds
Punk motherfuckers
