[Intro: Dru Down + Numskull]
It was a rigg up, rigg up
It was a rigg up, rigg up
It was a rigg up, rigg up
It’s a rigg up, rigg up

[Verse 1: Numskull]
I was hella drunk one night, had a gang of dope in the trunk that night
Now it was because me and my female had a catfight
She don’t act right, well, then she scuffle
Bloody eye, swollen lips, mad because I’m rapping and I fold a grip
Holding it down but now my temper’s taking over me
Fifth of Ray Ray and feeling overly
Violent, silent, trying to keep my cool but
Rat racing me, flipped out and hit a school bus
Kids flying every which way, don’t feel like it’s my problem
So, look at all the trouble that this trick made
Dazed, feeling woozy, Uzi tucked
And if I don’t grab it, I’m gone, ‘cause the car’s registered to my mom
I’m tore back, fingerprints everywhere
Grab my thang thang and proceeded to sky without no care
Flares jumpin’ off ‘cause the chopper’s out
Pyoon—big up to this fake ass rigg up

[Chorus: Numskull + (Dru Down)]
Selling weight out your house (is a rigg up)
A gang of peoples rolling craps (that’s a rigg up)
Leaving your house without your strap (that’s a rigg up)
(It’s just another burial ground that you suckas got to dig up)
Serving narcs in the open (that’s a rigg up)
Letting a broad keep your safe (that’s a rigg up)
A fifth of gin to the face (is a rigg up)
(It’s just another burial ground that you suckas got to dig up)

[Verse 2: Yukmouth]
Lodi dodi, my bros got 25 with an L for a body
I saw his ass at the party
Whoa, he must be snitchin’ to the po-po’s
And the don’t knows downtown talkin’ ‘bout he slangin’ pounds by the trunkload
Straight ghetto pass revoked
Talkin’ ‘bout we folks, got his knee broke ‘cause he spoke
To the Feds and kept speaking on, now we creepin’ on
His hoe, shoot at the bed that he sleeping on
Every week, police sweep in a Caprice or an OG
Looking for afros and gold teeth
We’s countin’ on ‘em, so if they hit the block, we bouncin’ on ‘em
Over hills and through the woods to the hood slangin’ ounces on ‘em
Bubble up, I got them double ups
Must the hustler, cats, don’t get your ass scuffled up
Plus the Luniz dump the pigeons up in boonies, you dig me?
(You jive ass turkey, you can’t rid me)

[Chorus: Numskull + (Dru Down)]
Selling weight out your house (is a rigg up)
A gang of peoples rolling craps (that’s a rigg up)
Leaving your house without your strap (that’s a rigg up)
(It’s just another burial ground that you suckas got to dig up)
Serving narcs in the open (that’s a rigg up)
Letting a broad keep your safe (that’s a rigg up)
A fifth of gin to the face (is a rigg up)
(It’s just another burial ground that you suckas got to dig up)

[Verse 3: Dru Down]
It was a rigg up, suckas, dig ‘em, smack me, slap me
Crack me in the back of the neck with the Tec
My body flex, these bustas really think they hard
They wanted the money off a dummy, ain’t a damn thing funny
Should I bust him? (Hell no) But they got me
They call me jackrabbit, the Bugsy, a bona fide fool
I made a move, quick as ever, busy like the weather
Was it clever? Never—the suckas caught me in the sweater, better
(Run for cover) trouble’s around the corner
From the East O to the North Pole, suckas just musta crossed the
Toll Plaza, ‘cause if they in the Town and found
Pound for pound, round for round, ammunition for Dru Down
Who now, wanna cross the, serial killer DD
P-I-want me to keep going-can’t forget the –M-P
Little OG who do these old riggas for a specialty
M-E-N-U, my menu, menu

[Chorus: Numskull + (Dru Down)]
Selling weight out your house (is a rigg up)
A gang of peoples rolling craps (that’s a rigg up)
Leaving your house without your strap (that’s a rigg up)
(It’s just another burial ground that you suckas got to dig up)
Serving narcs in the open (that’s a rigg up)
Letting a broad keep your safe (that’s a rigg up)
A fifth of gin to the face (is a rigg up)
(It’s just another burial ground that you suckas got to dig up)

[Outro: Dru Down + Numskull + (Yukmouth)]
You can’t get rigged up no more, baby boy
Dig that there
Females rigged me up, fools rigged me up
Folks on my spot rigged me up
You ain’t my folks
Get caught with the 1-2-1
It’ll never go down like that
If you think it will, you better think again
It’s 9-1-1 Rescue on a fool
It happened once, it could happen again, you know’m’sayin’
Dru Down and the Luniz in effect, boy
(Hahaha, so fuck them bustas—yeah, jump in the Ville…)
That’s right
(Claimin’ y’all bustas…peace)
