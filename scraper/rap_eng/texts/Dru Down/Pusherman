My woman, a woman saves and is strong
Produces envies
Has enchantments
Invidious and more has made the physical creation of ancestress
And has persecuted these people
That intend a generation of slavery
Sensitive is the sacramental
That's everywhere my room
It's a
Thruway to find my peace
From one day to one day
A soul to show the part that a mother knows
How to come the secret symptom of the save the soul
And there's not no one holding this
Until the stars
Begin to resemble their reflection
My room please, have it again, cause is doomed, my room
Isn't out of sight Funkadelic disco room
That somebody brothers and sisters
Want the all access backstage passes too
My womanhood ain't sold for no one and nothing
Because if I do no one thing
It's like kings wearing no rings
And the queens digging me the game
I'm just playing
My mama, hey mama
Put some, put some worstick on me
Ain't such a good doper like you
Pusher, baby
I'm your pusher
Don't bother me
Funk you up for funkology
I am your pusherman, baby
Give you monkey it feels okay!
Ain't no woman hearing me cry
Baby, here I'm standing for
Ain't no woman hearing me cry
See the power of a woman's eyes
I am a modern girl, you see
Can I put your brand on me
Yes, I know unmistakably
That I’ve never been your need
