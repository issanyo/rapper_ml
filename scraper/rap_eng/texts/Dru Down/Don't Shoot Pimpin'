[Dru Down]
Met a fly bitch, she hooked me up with another fly bitch
But I wanted to hook up with the first fly bitch
But it's alright bitch, I went along with the plan
Asked the bitch "Who's your man?", someone she couldn't stand
But supposedly, you know how them hoes be
(Leave 'em shakin', scared, mash up out that window)
Now the ho shook up and don't know where to gizo
My ways say pay, smooth paper, no bumpy rizoll
You already bought the tape so game bein' sizold
Don't start no shit won't be none, so girl don't play no reezole
Everything I say is manufactured to capture
You're old school, I need the bank, you're caught up in my rapture
But bein' as sharp as I am I seen the vision from the left eye
Seein' I'm bein' approached and by someone who just ain't lookin' right
He said (Nigga give me my ho) Who is you? (Cutthroat)
Is that so? (Fo' sho) Nigga oh (Nigga oh)
This nigga frontin' in front of my ho, he must don't know just how the game go
So I spoke softly, looked into his eyes and let him know
Formally introducin' myself, I'm one of the dopest
Hair fanatic, to the mind memo potent, I'm mackadocious
Pockets one of the fattest, capital P.I. status
Your ho re-chose, you're fired, she want me to manage
Now he's huffin' and puffin', this sucka gettin' uptight
He reached into his coat but that wasn't no fight

Don't shoot pimpin', because I'm pimped out
Pimpin' on a bitch now, partna learn the rules file
Don't shoot pimpin', because you got a ho
You see me with a ho plus 2, 3, 4, 5 more!
Don't shoot pimpin', because my game tight
Hair whipped, nice car, clean fit, a real pimp
Don't shoot pimpin', when pimpin' ain't did nothin' to you
Nigga hoes come and go, double up fool

[AMG]
I told her freeze baby, on your knees baby
I hope you ain't go no disease baby, let it breathe baby
Maybe we can take a cruise, in between what I choose
Lips or hips, and I hope you don't bruise
Easily we the P's - AMG and Dru Down-Down-Down
Wit it wit it, come and get it
The Bay to L.A., touch down on a ho
I'm a veteran bitch, you know why your mouth soaked
Sometimes I play, never pay, CLK in the city
Keep your toes pretty, no sadity
Bitches I got, pussy steamin' up the spot, make it hot
Take they knot, how you think I got what I got?
304 cold, keep these hoes in a broke mode
Reallionaire status, my bitch has got the baddest
Ass you ever seen, a millionaires wet dream
Suck it 'til it's clean baby

[Hook]
Don't shoot pimpin', because I'm pimped out
Pimpin' on a bitch now, partna learn the rules file
Don't shoot pimpin', because you got a ho
You see me with a ho plus 2, 3, 4, 5 more!
Don't shoot pimpin', because my game tight
Hair whipped, nice car, clean fit, a real pimp
Don't shoot pimpin', when pimpin' ain't did nothin' to you
Nigga hoes come and go, double up fool

[Suga Free]
Ho I'm 999,000 ~ 999 dollars and 99 cent away from gettin' rich, now get bitch
Now if I hang around 9 broke motherfuckers just like you... I would be the 10th!
He he! She wanna go get it but you won't let her go
You gots to admit it, your heart is in that ho
I'd like to teach y'all tricks to be, just like Suga Free
Stay fly for life and let a ho be a ho, and keep a pimp stick company
Now how you pimpin' partna? Ho Saver
Tryin' to hide her freaky behavior
Put her to work, that's how I came up
(Ho ho ho, Green Giant) Don't shoot the pimpin'
It's Suga Free and Dru Down, baby baby
And if you choosin' me baby you gots to pay me
You're just one less, page to answer
Just one less, ho to look after
So when she tryin' to hurt the pimpin', it's gonna be eez-alreezight
And when the player haters gon' get to hatin' and bein' fake
It's gon' be eez-alreezight

Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba... playa haters
Badda ba ba ba, badda ba ba ba... don't shoot the pimpin'
