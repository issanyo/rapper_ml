[Hook]
We can rock and we can roll
Forget about your thoughts and lose control
Look into my eyes and you see my soul
Just go ahead, let your head bang, and say, * * *

[Verse 2: Tech N9ne]
Locked like nun twat, block-block gun shots
Rum got, this one hot, fun to run from cops
Fuckin kumquats, I'mma make your lung stop
Your tongue drops, if you don't wanna play Tech Nina some rot
(Tech, Tech, Tech, N9ne, N9ne, N9ne, N9ne)
Lemon and Sprite with Hennessy
Women in tights, feminine dikes, I'm so finicky
You got two friends textin I'm up in that trinity
151 gonna finish me, sin it begins to enter me
Then an enemy finna be in the sea
Never would they replenish he
Rock star shit, Allahu Akhbar bitch
I drop hard hits, with the angel rock bar lit
A five star chick on this rock hard dick
Cause my guap large, trick, and you can't stop our grit
Dru and Tech, you respect
The tool'll get, right through your neck
If you neglect, to choose a set
You can bet, Dragon Crew's a threat
Smashin through the jet to do the steps in Budapest
And chew the check, so ruler gets
Gouda yes, that's when you the best
