[Intro]
Realer than real…ooh
Realer than real, realer than real…ooh
What’s the deal, folks?

[Verse 1]
It’s like this, like that, let me get my gat
Ooh, I’m back, I bet you didn’t know that I was strapped
So what’s up now? Talk off the wall like you was talkin’
You talk, you put your own self into that cabin
But no, really, I’m kicking these hits off like Vietnam
Not dropping no bombs, I got my soldiers and we fully on
Dru Down (lieutenant with the master plan)
I’m the man sitting to the captain (and you know that’s right)
Sho’nuff, listen to the bump
It shows you how I feel ‘cause I’m realer than real
Straight from the Oakland streets
Letting you suckas where the end meets
Stop! Nah, plot—I know where he go
He drives a step side with a 454, and oh
His hoe, the girl ain’t nuttin’ to me
She wanted to do me up for a 10-piece just last week
And she, kept doin’ and doin’ until there’s nothin’
(What she want from you, mayne?) She must wanna taste some yang
I wish people would take me for who I am
Karate chop, pop pop, okay, a couple from my Glock, and ah
Relief from my finger
I’m feeling a good sensation, I’m starting to wiggle and tingle
I feel great, bigger than United States
And if you know how I feel, that’s the deal, realer than real

[Chorus]
I’m so real, fakin’ on my folks is a no-no
Real, all we like to is parlay and bubble
I’m so real, fakin’ on my folks is a no-no
Real, all we like to is parlay and bubble

[Verse 2]
No falsifying (no no no no way)
I keep some gloves and a replaceable clip just for the AK
‘Cause I’m as real as they come, that ain’t no joke, see
Been living my life in the East O as a D-O-G
A B-U-L-L, a H-O-G
It doesn’t matter to me, I wanna get P-A-I-D
Realer than real, straight from the fever, test no nuts
Because my nuts is much bigger, trigger *click click*
That’s the sound of the gat being cocked back, jack
That’s the sound of the gat being cocked back
And that’s a true blue known fact
And if you feel me, say you do, and if you don’t, well, just shut your mouth
Excuse me because I’m Black and I’m proud
I’m walking through the streets of the G-H-E-T-T-O
Heart full of stone like my man Al Capone
My ball straight dropped, my hands clutched
The little youngsta’s walking on the street with a strut
That’s because the game was given to me by an OG
But since I’m like harder than steel that makes me realer than real

[Chorus]
I’m so real, fakin’ on my folks is a no-no
Real, all we like to is parlay and bubble
I’m so real, fakin’ on my folks is a no-no
Real, all we like to is parlay and bubble

[Verse 3]
For this third verse, I’ma hit you so damn hard
I shouldn’t have told you so I could catch your ass off guard
I gots a fever, to flavor
All players involved, no disregard to the mob
I’m getting further—haven’t you ever heard of me?
(Yeah, is your name D?) Nah, won’t you add one more D, please
And put your D’s together, run a check on a vet
And when you find out who I am, don’t flex on the vet
I’m so real, fakin’ on my folks is a no-no
Real, all we like to is parlay and bubble
And come up together, and do, you know, whatever
Playin’ selfish you’ll find yourself up in the river
And shiver, and quiver, no feeling in your toes
You’re going on a river stroll
I must uphold my stance on any land and on any man
Who figures that he’s bigger, nothin’ but a rigga
Well, here’s the deal, I hope you feel
That it was Mother Nature that me, like, realer than real

[Chorus]
I’m so real, fakin’ on my folks is a no-no
Real, all we like to is parlay and bubble
I’m so real, fakin’ on my folks is a no-no
Real, all we like to is parlay and bubble
Real, fakin’ on my folks is a no-no
Bubble, bubble, parlay, bubble
I’m so real, fakin’ on my folks is a no-no
Parlay, bubble, parlay, bubble
