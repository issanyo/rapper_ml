[Intro: The Jacka]
Knock you out your tube socks for real
Kick the high-speed in my Chevelle
Same time they lock me, same time I bail
Feelin' like I'm 2pac for real
Killin' like I'm on hop for real
Killin' like my niggs are Brazil
Knock you out your tube socks for real
Feelin' like I'm 2pac for real

[Verse 1: The Jacka]
Your girl is using blow, and she using you, too
There'll be cum on my phone the bitch swallow my load and these the  type of hoes these niggas used to
No wrapping blow we packin' blow in every house I ride through
How is it if i buy a leather couch I can sell 1000 ounces before I burn it out
Shit my bitches turned out all the shit they know now
If we ever had a job probably never stick around
I'm so deep up in the grind and can't nothin' set me down
I can set it to your face but you'll never leave the don
Right now I'm so laced that I wished I stayed on
Cause I woulda sent my niggas they could hang on
I still feel pain even though my bank long
But I came from hitting banks with a ringer face on
Pigs pulling over cars but we make em chase ours
(?) but they'll never take ours
Every fool get shot never try 'n play us out
I really sold rock gotta keep my hammer cocked
2 chains'll get you 2pacced
Knock you out your tube socks..tube socks
When a nigga in my crew parts, same day I lose heart
This one for my niggas' life'll never get a new start

[Hook: The Jacka]
Knock you out your tube socks for real
Kick the high-speed in my Chevelle
Same time they lock me, same time I bail
Feelin' like I'm 2pac for real
Killin' like I'm on hop for real
Killin' like my niggs are Brazil
Knock you out your tube socks for real
Feelin' like I'm 2pac for real

Killin' cause I'm in the Mob for real
Hunnid chops ain't none for sale
Kick the high-speed in my Camaro
So (?) smoke coming out the barrel
Killin' like I'm on hop for real
Killin' like my niggs are Brazil
Knock you out your tube socks for real
Feelin' like I'm 2pac for real
