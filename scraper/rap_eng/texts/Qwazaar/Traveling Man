[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Some say [??] power for people
Never bow to their evil
But traces of the humanity got a surge to the [?]
It's the same old new [?]
Limitless with them sequels
Your pain my pain
Keep it separate but equal
While trying to dodge these maniac cops
And [??]
[You need to find a?] place in your heart [that be hard to?] see through
Beginning gauge while tweaking his page
[??] find another bleeding
If we speak in the game we all [??] enrage
Disgracing and hurt
Anger steady streaming in wave
From one continuous loop it just plays and it plays
These minutes they just diminish as they quicken our haste
And because lay our bodies down stressed [?] in our graves

[Hook: Sample]
I'm [alone?] from traveling here
Been [?] traveling away from home
I'm [alone?] from traveling here
Would love to lay this body down

[Bridge]
You can't forget where you came from if you never knew
You never knew
Just stare into that space without a plan to set [your ways?]
Should make plans to escape

[Verse 2]
I awake from my slumber good
It [?] further but came before me
I'm searching for what I don't know
But this world this world ain't looking for me
Just want to be free in my zone
Just want my mind it's my own
In privacy of my home
Don't want no riots in me
Something that keeps me from [harm?]
Something's that keeping me strong
This here is more than a song
It [?] the longer I wait
And when I leave it I'm gone
There's no retreat no return
I'm gonna take what I earn
But first I come to the [sea?]
