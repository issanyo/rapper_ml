[Chorus]
It’s the Nutshack! (Yee, yee)
It’s the Nutshack! (What'd he say?)
It’s the Nutshack! (Oh, yeah!)
It’s the Nutshack! (Hey, I'm in that shit!)
It’s the Nutshack! (Don't forget ya boy Angel!)
It’s the Nutshack! (It’s the Nutshack!)
It’s the Nutshack! (It’s the Nutshack!)
It’s the Nutshack! (It’s the Nutshack…)
It’s the Nutshack! (Hey!)
It’s the Nutshack! (This beat's knockin'!)
It’s the Nutshack! (Wow!)
It’s the Nutshack!

[Verse 1: NUMP]
Phil’s from the soul, Jack’s from the P.I
Horatio the Horat so big-eyed!
Tito Dick, “Dickman”, baby!
He raised Phil and loves the ladies
Jack’s cool is lazy, he’s still learnin’
Otherwise Cherry Pie, he's still a virgin
Chita, meet the freak of the week-ah!
Phil’s homegirl, got Jack wanna keep her
But it’s not happenin’, neither!
Shakin’ like a seizure
Hold up, let me spark this, take a breather
Breathe reefer in my lungs
I got grapes, what you watchin’, son?

[Chorus]
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack! (Yo!)
It's the Nutshack! (Yo!)

[Verse 2: NUMP]
Dwayne is a hater, later alligator
Phil is the leader of the masturbators
Thanks to Sanjee, more porn than Ronnie
Jeremy, see? Smelling like 'nani
Oolie oolie ollie ollie, still be true-lie fo-sho-li
Oolie oolie ollie ollie, do the foolie fo-sho-li, olie
Woah-wow, hyphy hypo
NUMP on the track, no, it's not a typo
3030/Sick Wid It, exquisite, explicit
Angel will pimp your ride, without Xzibit
Ed got his back, he do what he can
But whenever I do, I do it bigger than man!

[Chorus]
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
It's the Nutshack!
