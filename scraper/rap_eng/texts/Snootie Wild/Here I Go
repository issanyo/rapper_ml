[Intro: Starlito]
I gotta keep it
I told you niggas
I told 'em, I told 'em
Unstoppable
This the kinda shit that I'm on
Take all my pain and put that shit in a song
Just wrote a letter last thing it said was stay strong
I give my niggas hope, I gotta keep goin'

[Hook: Snootie Wild]
Told these niggas ain't no stoppin' me (aye)
Told these niggas ain't no stoppin' me (aye)
Told these niggas ain't no
Told these niggas quit hatin'
I told these niggas quit hatin' (aye)
I told these niggas quit hatin' (aye)
So fuck it here I go (oh)
Fuck it here I go (oh, oh)
Fuck it here I go (oh)
Fuck it here I go (oh, oh)
Told these niggas ain't no stoppin' me (aye)
Told these niggas ain't no stoppin' me (aye)
Told ya niggas ain't no
Told ya niggas quit hatin'

[Verse 1: Starlito]
Ain't no stoppin' me, ain't got no breaks
Can't take no breaks
No rearview, no lookin' back
Just learn from when you make mistakes
No patience on this paper chase
I can't wait nor hate
I'm too busy grindin'
Look at what I did, I visualized
And went to get it
Finally business minded
Pretty much indifferent to them criticizin'
Really shinin' for my guys in prison
Plus my niggas dyin' back-to-back-to-back
That's why I smoke like dat
Never really had shit
How the fuck I'm spose to act
Toaster in my lap, I'm ridin'
Never been opposed to that
Smoke you like some dro and get ghost
Like someone wrote my raps
I'm throwed, niggas throwin' shots like
I won't throw 'em back
But ain't no blockin' these
Nor stoppin' these
Snootie told ya that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
I hate the choices I've made
Feel like I'm trapped in the cage
But that's the price that you pay
For smokin' dank everyday
My body's gettin' the shakes
Mind is about to fade
Cause every time I'm awake
I fall in these fucked up days
The devil is in my face
No turnin' the other way
He's callin' my fuckin' name
He's playin' these mental games
Bobbling' up my brain
Drivin' yo boy insane
Cause even when I regain
My heart is still full of pain
Goddammit this shit is strange
Hustling in the rain
Tryin' to cool all my rage
And stack up my cheddar, mayne
Gotta try to maintain
Come wit a better plan
Or end up get wet up dead
Or locked down up in the pen
They let me out at the end
I'm startin' over again
Cuz once you up in the system
Your freedom you never win
Gotta try to repent
For me and my children
Cause thuggin' I really love it
That's why I be in the wind (wind)

[Hook]
