[Intro: Lazy-Boy]
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
That's on the gang, we'll lay shit down, yeah

[Chorus: Lazy-Boy]
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
That's on the gang, we'll lay shit down
Yeah they say I'm kinda famous now
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
A couple bands really ain't shit now
Yeah they say I'm kinda famous now, ayy

[Verse 1: Lazy-Boy]
A couple bands what I'm used to
I just hit a milly on the YouTube (true)
HK when I zoom through
Baby this ain't what you used to
I'm only in it for the benefits
Started poppin', now I'm fuckin' with this stripper bitch
Got the draco in the seat when I'm in the car
I'm goin' hard for my brothers on the prison yard
Yeah, I heard that pussy got mileage
All these bitches wanna fuck 'cause I'm shinin'
Ayy, hella gold with the diamonds
Yeah I got hella gold with the diamonds

[Chorus: Lazy-Boy]
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
That's on the gang, we'll lay shit down
Yeah they say I'm kinda famous now
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
A couple bands really ain't shit now
Yeah they say I'm kinda famous now, ayy

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
Famous Amos, smokin' cookie
And my baby mama hatin', tryna jugg me
I didn't come into this game to be famous, ayy
Speak the truth but they say I'm armed and dangerous, ayy
Never ever ever ever been average
And the judge tryna throw the book at me
Al Bundy with the love, no marriage
Country nigga, cornbread and cabbage, ayy
Snootie Wild this, Snootie Wild that
Please get up off my dick, ayy, ayy
He done done this, he done done that
But a nigga still gettin' rich, ayy

[Chorus: Lazy-Boy]
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
That's on the gang, we'll lay shit down
Yeah they say I'm kinda famous now
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
A couple bands really ain't shit now
Yeah they say I'm kinda famous now, ayy

[Verse 3: Lazy-Boy]
Yeah I got my city lit now
My gang walk around like we the shit now
Speakin' on my name, he a dead man, ayy
I just made another ten bands, ayy
I'm gettin' money, I ain't savin' hoes
I bet they never thought they'd hear me on the radio
If you want a problem I'll give them that
You know I'm in the hood where the members at
Bands off the rap shit, yeah it's callin'
She tryna link up but I'm stallin'
Jumped in the game broke, now I'm scorin'
Now it's trophies on my neck in the morning

[Chorus: Lazy-Boy]
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
That's on the gang, we'll lay shit down
Yeah they say I'm kinda famous now
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
A couple bands really ain't shit now
Yeah they say I'm kinda famous now

[Outro: Lazy-Boy]
I don't know why they hatin' on me
But I gotta keep a thing on me
I don't know why they hatin' on me
That's on the gang, we'll lay shit down
Yeah they say I'm kinda famous now
