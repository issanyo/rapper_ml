[Hook]
Roxanne, Roxanne, Roxanne
You got me feeling this way (this way)
Roxanne, Roxanne, Roxanne
You make me feel so great (so great)

[Verse 1]
Breaking a down a Roxie, kick back [?], filling up my body, aye
No one need a body, all a nigga Roxie, can I get a [?] aye
Here's first to the month, and I got me some money
Yeah I'm bout to get blunted, first I need that Roxie
Anybody seen Roxanne, anyone seen Roxanne
First I spend my cash, then I pick her up
How I break her down, knew she had a crush
I'm loving it, I'm loving it, ain't no breaking up
Unless I'm breaking up, Roxanne

[Hook]
