[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
10 milli yo, sponsored by CMG
Mac a write a book about who owe me
Pussy ass niggas gone D.I.E., on sight, A.S.A.P
Nigga say he gonna snatch my chain
Nigga better know my name
Suicide man the boy insane
He lost his mind that nigga lost his point
If I'm beefing with a nigga I'll fuck his baby momma
Get all in her head and tell that bitch that I love her
Send a pack to my partner
Send a demo to a cousin
Ooh I got his ass in the oven
I just seen this money turn a pretty bitch ugly
Time made a nigga turn state on his cousin
Bitch broke up the whole squad for the pussy
Never be us, swear to god, or we pussy
I fuck with Snootie Wild the strong way
All I know is yayo like the song say
Money dont fold, its the long way
Slow grand, took the long way
My niggas my niggas forever
Enemies, enemies forever
Bitch you whatever
Like Meek said there's levels
And choppers are devils
Got extended on .40 Glocks, I love my Beretta
I might just be a gun fanatic cause my ego a devil

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I've been selling crack since I was 12
Still trying to duck 12 (yep)
Old school Chevy for twelves
And two grams short no scales
Nigga that 12
I don't hit the club before 12
I never fuck with no 12
My bitch is on 12
And my status so hot
I ain't trying to fuck nothing else, yup!

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
All a nigga move is bells
And I move them in dark after 12
Four years locked in a cell and they let me out, nigga, 'round 12
GD is what a nigga bank and it's nothing but love screaming 12
Fuck with a mothafucking client
I'll send your whole crew straight to hell
Nigga hit a lick for like 12 blocks
Caught a motherfucker slipping by the mailbox
My young nigga got hit with like six shots
That's why a nigga walk around here shellshocked
I don't hit the club 'til 12
12 o'clock on my rollie
Nigga might work for the 12
Motherfucker don't know me
Partner called me out for a bitch, so a nigga had to bail
Big brother Gotti told me, don't trust shit in this world
12!

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I've been selling crack since I was 12
Still trying to duck 12 (yep)
Old school Chevy for twelves
And two grams short no scales
Nigga that 12
I don't hit the club before 12
I never fuck with no 12
My bitch is on 12
And my status so hot
I ain't trying to fuck nothing else, yup!

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
I've been selling crack since I was 12
Still trying to duck 12 (yep)
Old school Chevy for twelves
And two grams short no scales
Nigga that 12
I don't hit the club before 12
I never fuck with no 12
My bitch is on 12
And my status so hot
I ain't trying to fuck nothing else, yup!
