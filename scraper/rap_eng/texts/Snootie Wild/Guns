[Hook]
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
Any motherfucker in here nervous, they better run
Any motherfucker in here nervous, they better run
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
I’m a motherfucker, I fucked on your baby moms
I’m a motherfucker, I fucked on your baby moms

[Verse 1: Snootie Wild]
I’m a motherfucker, I fucked on your baby moms
Shit, if you don’t believe me ask your baby moms
You don’t know what I been into, don’t know what I done
Gutter gutter, mud mud, coming straight from the slums
Ay ay, paranoid, I keep me a gun
If a nigga get nervous, bitch nigga better run
I can smell the fear in niggas, I can smell when it comes
I’mma fuck your baby mama, I’mma fuck till she comes
Wrap em up, put em straight in the trunk
Bitch drive, make sure daddy get to the plug
Fish fry, sent it to me straight like I love you
Who gives a fuck, young and thugging, guns I love em

[Hook]
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
Any motherfucker in here nervous, they better run
Any motherfucker in here nervous, they better run
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
I’m a motherfucker, I fucked on your baby moms
I’m a motherfucker, I fucked on your baby moms

[Verse 2:  Gunplay]
I keep a pistol and pussy in my lap at all times
I keep both of em popping, I’m just a popular guy
My nigga fuck what you thought, I got what you want
I go where you can’t nigga, and do what you won’t
I love swishers and bitches, I love cocaine and cars
I love strippers and money, but my chopper’s in charge
I fuck on your baby mom and wipe my dick on the couch
Send her to the store and make her whip up an ounce
Yeah I do that, true that, thought you knew that
Ay, hold up, I rolled up, and ran through that

[Hook]
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
Any motherfucker in here nervous, they better run
Any motherfucker in here nervous, they better run
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
I just stick with my choppers, I just stick with my guns
I’m a motherfucker, I fucked on your baby moms
I’m a motherfucker, I fucked on your baby moms
