I ain't never, I ain't never seen life like this before
Sorta shit don't really just matter to me, (aye)
They look at my eyes, they wonder why, why, why
Why the, why the shit don't matter to me, (aye)

I ain't never, I never seen a life like this before
Sort of shit don't really, don't matter to me, (aye)
They look at my eyes, they wondering why, why, why
Why the, why the shit don't matter to me, (aye)

[Verse 1]
All the things that I done came with god damn habits
Paranoid schizophrenic aye, tryin not to panic, aye
They look at my eyes, they wonderin why, why, why
Why the, why the shit just don't matter to me
I done seen my niggas get buried in the god damn streets
I done thought about me getting buried in the god damn streets
Suicide thoughts was keeping me high, high, high
Can't go cuz my kids need somethin to eat, aye
I'm tryna be all I can be in these god damn streets
While these fake ass niggas wanna be just wannabes, aye
I ain't never have shit, no, I ain't never have shit
From living to jail to homeless as hell
They wonder why, I, I

[Verse 2]
Aye, ain't no love in me
No trust, ain't nothing but a thug in me
Got yo hands out, but it ain't a hug to me
Get nothing but a mug from me, aye
Cuz I ain't never seen a life-life like this before
In this world, nigga ain't nothing for free, aye
From flipping a brick to moving a pound, pound, pound
In this world, nigga ain't nothing for free
Can't get comfortable
Niggas a rob, get comfortable
This the man, this the business man
They wonder why, I, I
