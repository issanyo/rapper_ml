[Verse 1: Rico Richie]
This for gangsta niggas only
You real niggas show me
You so motherfuckin' petty
You ain't my motherfuckin' homie, nigga
Yeah, better act like you know me
I don't fuck with the phonies
20 cash and the Rollie, nigga
Yeah, you don't like it nigga, shoot somethin'
Big checks like Nike, just do it, huh
I been gettin' it since the 10th grade
Nigga don't like it, get hit with the 10th fade
I don't fuck with the petty bitches
And I'm all about my fetty nigga
I got my shooters in the Chevy nigga
Foreign girl with the foreign, bitch got a plenty nigga

[Hook: Rico Richie]
You petty, you petty
You petty, you petty

You petty, you petty
You petty, you petty
I ain't fuckin' with you niggas, you so petty
I ain't fuckin' with you bitches, you too petty

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
Baby mama bad
Whole squad ready
Bitch in the kitchen whippin'
So I named her Betty
Ride in that trunk
Real look like hula hoop
Double cup, lean
Sippin' on that beetle juice
We still flippin' bricks
You can call it somersault
I don't give a damn
Nigga what my mama talk?
Let her call me daddy
Love the way my Rollie glow
Nigga wanna rob
I'mma show you petty dough
Feelin' like a god
Son of a boss
Real niggas stand
While fake niggas fall
Plenty of women
Many bitches petty though
When we leave the club
Now these bitches ready

[Hook: Rico Richie]
You petty, you petty
You petty, you petty
I ain't fuckin' with you niggas cause you petty
I ain't fuckin' with you bitches cause you petty
You petty, you petty
You petty, you petty
I ain't fuckin' with you niggas, you so petty
I ain't fuckin' with you bitches, you too petty
