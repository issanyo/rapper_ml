I want u 2 know
The streets part of me, yea you is all I see
I want u 2 know
You stay on mind, but I'm still gon' grind
I want u 2 know
Fuck it, I want u 2 know
No no no no no

Yo Gotti(verse 1:)
Gotta go, Gotta go (go)
Really don't want to (no) Rather stay at home, (home)
Countin' dope(dope)fucking on you(aye)
But my life here real(real), And the streets are too(too)
