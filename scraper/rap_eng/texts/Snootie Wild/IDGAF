[Hook]

All I know, I don't give a fuck
All I know, I don't give a fuck
All I know, I don't give a fuck

All I know, I don't give a fuck
All I know, I don't give a fuck
All I know, I don't give a fuck
Nigga not no more
Nigga not no more

Step in the club, nigga I don't give a fuck
Ride in the cut, nigga I don't give a fuck
Broke no joke, nigga I don't give a fuck
Nigga not no more
Nigga not no more

Kick in your door, nigga I don't give a fuck
Take your dough, nigga I don't give a fuck
Fuck your ho, nigga I don't give a fuck
Nigga not no more
Nigga not no more

[Verse 1]

All I know, streets raised us
Broke no joke, who can I trust
I don't know, I don't give a fuck
Not no more, nigga not no more
Hit me a lick, cop me a bowl
Stay on my flow, watch it roll
Bitch with a throat, she gon choke
Moby dick, there she blows
There she goes, straight on the track
Lying on her back, making re-stacks
I don't give a fuck, not no more
Bout no bitch, bout no ho
Love is wack, rather have a sack
Moving a pack, keep me a gat
I'm go mode, he go mode
Pockets swoll, bag is swoll
If you try to snatch, nigga soul get snatched
Nigga live like I'm [?], nigga I'mma [?]
Nigga keep me a gat, nigga don't get jacked
Nigga car get jacked, nigga sitting on four
Y'all don't pay, so I don't give a fuck
[?] Pay, so I don't give a fuck
Keys ain't free, so I don't give a fuck
Nigga not no more, nigga not no more

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

All I know, in god we trust
Nigga [?], [?]
I don't know, I don't give a fuck
Not no more, nigga not no more
Stay with a strap, like no joke
Gotta keep hope, hand in the coat
Take me a smoke, prepare me some dope
Watch for the cops, there they go
There they roll, straight down the street
Always some heat, especially me
I don't give a fuck, not no more
About your warrant, about your code
Laws ain't shit, really ain't slick
Y'all need to quit, making me sick
Fuck y'all cell, fuck yourself
Y'all ain't real, y'all ain't fair
Had me a job, nigga fired from a job
Nigga life got hard, nigga, fuck started to rob
Nigga then I got spotted, nigga built me a mob
Nigga [?], nigga I'm go mode
No more [?], so I don't give a fuck
All in her face, so I don't give a fuck
Fuck who you know, so I don't give a fuck
Nigga not no more, nigga not no more
