[Intro: Snootie Wild]
All I know is, all I know is hustling
All I know is, all I know is balling

[Hook: Snootie Wild]
All I know is hustling and balling, hustling and balling
Hustling and balling, hustling
All I know is hustling and balling, hustling and balling
Hustling and balling

[Verse 1: Trinidad James]
All I know is jacking and dabbing, I say rapping and swagging
40 boast my Saint Laurent, same caller as [?]
I'mma let these niggas have it, 2050 'til the casket
And if I ever fall off, boy I bet these bitches catch me
I'm a old school Atlanta nigga, swag Tom Glad
If you got that shit strong reefer nigga, call, let me match it
I'm a smooth operator
I buy new shoes if I got new haters
I can have your bitch tutu-tooting off the table
Me and SnootSnoot-Snootie got that bitch going crazy
I say fucking up a check in SupperClub, we so player
Got that feet up on your couch, kicking Rick James flavour cause

[Hook: Snootie Wild]
All I know is hustling, all I know is hustling
All I know is hustling
All I know is balling, all I know is balling
All I know is balling
All I know is hustling and balling, hustling and balling
Hustling and balling, hustling
All I know is hustling and balling, hustling and balling
Hustling and balling

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
Hustling and balling
Me and Trinidad, your bitch be balling
Hit the club nigga, we all alcoholics
Sparklers in the air, smoking whatchacallit
All gold Rollie head, nigga that's my flavour
Money in the air, put it on the table
Ass in the air, get it off the table
All off the cane, whipping like maple
Me and Trinidad talking pimping
All off the bitch, all off the gang
All off the hustle, all off the fame
All off the Jager, all gold chain

[Hook: Snootie Wild]
All I know is hustling, all I know is hustling
All I know is hustling
All I know is balling, all I know is balling
All I know is balling
All I know is hustling and balling, hustling and balling
Hustling and balling, hustling
All I know is hustling and balling, hustling and balling
Hustling and balling

[Bridge: Trinidad James]
I want you to come hustle with me, hustle with me
Hustle with me
I want you to come hustle with me, hustle with me
Hustle with me
Come hustle with me now, hustle with me now
Hustle with me now
Come hustle with me now, hustle with me now
Hustle with me now
