[Chorus]
Hop up in this Benz, Benz, Benz, hop up in this Benz
Hop up in this Benz ho, you know what I’m in ho
Hop up in this Benz, Benz, Benz, hop up in this Benz
Hop up in this Benz ho, you and your friend ho

[Verse 1]
Hop up in this Benz, once again, I’m at it again
System winging loud, blowing loud, straight off in the wind
Wind, wind, wind, wind, wind, 100 a ten
What I’m doing fast, throwing cash, I’m showing my ass
CMG gone win, white on white, mister yayo Benz
Throwing up the deuces, I don’t know you, I am not your friend
Friend, friend, friend, friend, friend, GD what it is?
Man I need like ten, wrap em up, put em in the Benz
Skkrt, Skkrt, Skkrt, Skkrt, Skkrt, I’m at it again
Party hard like a white boy, it is what it is
Serving white to a white boy while sitting in my Benz
Hit your bitch then I took your bitch, she like that my Benz

[Chorus]
Hop up in this Benz, Benz, Benz, hop up in this Benz
Hop up in this Benz ho, you know what I’m in ho
Hop up in this Benz, Benz, Benz, hop up in this Benz
Hop up in this Benz ho, you and your friend ho

[Verse 2]
Hop up in this Benz ho, we ain’t gone pretend ho
I know you a freaky dyke, you can bring your friend ho
I keep plenty rocks, pour a four, pistol in the car
You know who I are, they know I’m a star ho
[?] Benz, inside choco
Keep a strap in case, like my nigga Rocko
Make your bitch cha-cha, pussy doing the hopscotch
She know what I’m in, hop up in this Benz ho

[Chorus]
Hop up in this Benz, Benz, Benz, hop up in this Benz
Hop up in this Benz ho, you know what I’m in ho
Hop up in this Benz, Benz, Benz, hop up in this Benz
Hop up in this Benz ho, you and your friend ho
