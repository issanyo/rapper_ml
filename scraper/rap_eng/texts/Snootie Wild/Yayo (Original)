[Hook: x3]
Yayo
All I know is yayo, Every time she hit the block that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco and you nigga know so

[Verse 1]
Ay yayo, all I know is yayo
Hit the block, I'm motored up and form me just like playdough
And if you try to rob me leave you holed up like a bagel
The block I never let go.. Cause I say so
Ay leggo, please leggo my eggo, before I have to let that desert fly just like an eagle
Cause if you didn't know my nigga please dont test my ego, cause my life belito {?}
Ay, peso, money that where I go, if I ever go broke, then I come and get yours
You green ass niggas acting like your whole lot gettin repoed, trying to be a hero, end up bein a zero

[Hook x2]
Yayo
All I know is yayo, Every time she hit the block that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco and you nigga know so


[Verse 2]
Yea I just said yayo, taste just like candy cane but whiter then dat pure snow
And why you trying to play me and you know you selling wappo
When you with the boss, then I got to say so, aye oh no, hit these licks like oh no
Counting all this mula paper you can call it mucho, cause I be rockin all this paper
Moving with like macho, I be eatin nachos, cheese, guapo aye vato, holla at amigo
And he gone get them bricks and wrap them tighter then burritos, I let him know
I need it for the low and need it pronto, he gone ship them off (psh) torpedo
