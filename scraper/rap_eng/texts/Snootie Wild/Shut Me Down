[Chorus]
One thing for sure, two things for certain, they can’t shut me down
Po-po patrol these blocks, my bando, they can’t shut me down
She suck me so super, shut me down
But these niggas, they can’t shut me down
One thing for sure, two things for certain, they can’t shut me down
Po-po patrol these blocks, my bando, they can’t shut me down
She suck me so super, shut me down
But these niggas, they can’t shut me down

[Verse 1]
Love my found, love my squad
But, I can’t let it shut me down
There’s rules and regulations when you laying ground
I built me a foundation, we can’t tear it down
It’s hard to understand what your eyes can’t see
But if you know a nigga you know loayalty
I never threw a rock and tried to hide my hand
If we got caught, it’s my choice, stood up like a man
I’m a different type of real, is you feeling me?
I’m a different type of kill, niggas killing me
One thing for sure, two things for certain, you can ask around
Certified up in my town, nigga ain’t fucking around

[Chorus]
One thing for sure, two things for certain, they can’t shut me down
Po-po patrol these blocks, my bando, they can’t shut me down
She suck me so super, shut me down
But these niggas, they can’t shut me down
One thing for sure, two things for certain, they can’t shut me down
Po-po patrol these blocks, my bando, they can’t shut me down
She suck me so super, shut me down
But these niggas, they can’t shut me down

[Verse 2]
I been around my nigga, I been around, I been around
Deep in these projects and these hoods nigga, town to town
And every motherfucking street nigga hold me down
And every hating motherfucker want to take me out
But I can’t let that stop me so that there would never be
They know that I’m the element, that mean that I’m the key
I’m not a rapper but the only rapper in these streets
Deep in these projects, tryna whip me up a masterpiece
I never sleep, all about these fucking streets
Put my niggas on, even the ones killing me
They can’t shut me down, I can’t let them stop me now
I don’t fuck around, you die tryna shut me down

[Chorus]
One thing for sure, two things for certain, they can’t shut me down
Po-po patrol these blocks, my bando, they can’t shut me down
She suck me so super, shut me down
But these niggas, they can’t shut me down
One thing for sure, two things for certain, they can’t shut me down
Po-po patrol these blocks, my bando, they can’t shut me down
She suck me so super, shut me down
But these niggas, they can’t shut me down
