Ridin' round my city 4x

[VERSE 1: BOOSIE BADAZZ]
White chalks and black outs
We be dyin' so young
Murder rate chasin' tha birth rate
In this city I'm from (Yeah nigga)
Fingerprints all on tha duck tape
And his palm on tha gun
That's what they told him, but they lied
And that nigga, he sung
Where I'm from, cum thicker than blood
Niggas turn on they thug
Get in they ear, these niggas turn on tha plug
I'm from tha mud where it get funky
Ride or die, me & Donkey
Promise boy, you don't want it
Don't [?] why, we walk up on ya
In my city, they ride or die
Boys off H and 11-5, lil' nigga strapped ain't scared to die
Make you ask me where I'm from huh
It's bigger than dis crawfish
I'm tellin' you it's raw shit
Baton Rouge Vs Everybody
Bet Baton Route murked everybody nigga

[HOOK]
Ridin' round my city 2x
They ridin' round my city
Ridin' round my city 3x
They ridin' round my city
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride
Ridin' round my city 2x
They ridin' round my city
Ride round they city
They ride round my city 3x
Ride, Ride, Ride, Ride

[VERSE 2: Snootie Wild]
North Memphis where I bang at, hang at
Nigga get wrong, leave him dead on tha pavement
Dread head affliate, nigga I'm a shotta
Hot like pasta, all black like tha mobsta
Hatas ain't loyal, bitches ain't loyal
Tha bitch fuck ya best friend, he workin' wit' them boys (Damn)
Now you need a lawyer
Couple money orders
Tha streets used to love ya, but now they don't know ya
Ain't no pity in gangsta city, oh lordy
Murder, murder, murder what them young niggas knowin'
Ima OG, so Im gon' have to show ya
Fuck it, I'll die tryin'
Why a nigga show 'em why I

[HOOK] with AD LIBS TIL' THE END
