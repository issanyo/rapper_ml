You know when you hear that Haaan!

[Hook: Snootie Wild]
Eh, yayo, all I know is yayo
Every time she hit the block that ho she be on go mode
And if you try to rob me, swear to God that be a no-no
Sauced up and I'm loco and you niggas know so

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
Shout out to my day-o, (?), yayo
That white shit put me on the bread, I should call it mayo
And my niggas go all out, I should call 'em 'ayo
That choppa lay you down, you can't get up, I call it K.O
Yeah, J-O that's what I call jump off
Your baby baby momma on the dick and she don't wanna jump off
Sucker found out, hit the roof and jumped off
It's fucked up that I jumped off, made a nigga jump off
Yeah, Pablo, Griselda and Chapo
Big we live like kingpins, vacation in Cabo
Bossed up, El Fabo, no money, no hablo
Two bottle of (?), all I know is yayo

[Hook: Snootie Wild x2]

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
Ey, yayo, yeah, I just sayed yayo
Taste just like that candy cane but whiter then that pure snow
And why'd you try to play me and you know you selling 'uapo?
When you with the boss, then I got to say so
Aye, oh no, hit these licks like like "oh no"
Counting all this mula paper, you can call it mucho
Cause I be rockin' all this paper, movin' weight like macho
I be eatin' nacho, cheese, guapo
Aye, vato, holler at amigo
If he gon' get them bricks and wrap 'em tighter than burrito
I let 'em know I need them for the low, he need it pronto
He gon' ship 'em off, pfff, torpedo

[Hook: Snootie Wild x2]

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
I swear, ha haaah
Yayo yayo, all I know is yayo
It feels some type way, you niggas know I let that K go
Couple dudes is nice, the rest of y'all just in the away tho
The coke is from Colombia, the kush is from LA tho
I get it in the mail, I got some people on the pay roll
Let it sit they like it even better when it's a day old
Money sure will get you either shot, stabbed or K.O'ed
Whenever I say go, y'all know, they know
Extendo out the window, motherfucker, broad day tho
Devil with the pitchfork or the angel with the halo
Spanish mami with me, fat ass J-Lo
She asked me what I do I told her "all I know is yayo"

[Hook: Snootie Wild x2]

[Verse 4: YG]
It's yayo, on the block, when it's hot like motherfucker
Per shot, the homies cop like motherfucker
The homie turned into a (?) in the fiends level
These niggas on the block say a "no" a day
These niggas live like Penny Hardaway
Plus a whole bird now sellin' ounce for ounce, oh you owe money,part that's a harder way
He just got out on motherfuckin' bail
He just got a pack in the motherfuckin' mail
Plus the open sea I smell thrife
Oh, that's that Scarface
Oh, the small take, oh smell so tonsey
We movin' work like hover move the nest of worthless
Oh, we them niggas, oh, we got them hittaz
Oh, that yayo bakin' soda free, I like yo niggas
Hold up, shh, on the phone niggas don't talk now
Get in that interrogation room and their bitch...

[Verse 5: French Montana]
Yayo, yayo, all we need is yayo
Killers on the payroll
Clap, you sniff some yayo
Dikeman got that yayo
Heights got that yayo
Forlter got that yayo
Broadway got that yayo
Yayo, yayo, trafficking that yayo
If they pull us over, bujubun time with that yayo
Bucu with that yayo
Cucu with that yayo
Soda on the side, chicken nugget with that yayo
Pablo and Diego, swallowin' that yayo
Flights from Republic, damn it, doodoo in that yayo
My nigga down south got a plug on that yayo
Catch me up top 'bout fifty for that yayo

[Outro: French Montana]
Coke Boy (all i know is yayo)
