Funny bitch I was tellin' you about
All the hoes are in love now
I'm a hit the strip club
Now that's some shit that it won't get old to me
Please don't talk them hoes to me
Then you pay what you owe to me

There is no shame
A nigga won't change
I wanna make new money
It ain't no pain

You know bitches and my new hoes
