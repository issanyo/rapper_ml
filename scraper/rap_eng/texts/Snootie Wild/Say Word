(Intro: DC Young Fly)
Lame? Who she calling lame?
Say word! This bih right here don't even know who she talking  to! Lit head ass!
And your friend stank! They musty, you too grown for that shit Have you talkin' bout, FUCK YOU MEAN?

(Chorus: K Camp & Sy Ari)
A million niggas marching, they on go
We worth a couple mil' on the low
Say word (x6)

Nobody ever gave us nothin', niggas know (ain't need to know)
Can't let these pussy niggas try me like no hoe (no hoe)
Say word (x6)

(Verse 1: Sy Ari Da Kid)
Stop the sorrow, I'm a capo
Pockets looking like avocado
When you pop a bottle, them thots'll follow
Don't watch me, you're not Movado
Two pocket flacko, on the block with Pablo
In the kennel I can murder any instrumental
Niggas sleepin' and they asked for a nigga to put a fucking show to get me head or tail, I ain't flippin' nickel

(Verse 2: K Camp)
And after that paper so long, nigga I'm here I'm the king of the throne
Ran up my check, I did that on my own
Blow passed a hater, I leave him alone
Always been silent, not fearing no nigga
I did what I did, now they hearin' a nigga
Behind the wheel swervin', I'm steerin' my nigga
That night that Jeff died, it brought tears to a nigga

(Verse 3: Snootie Wild)
H-h-hell
Chop it up on my block, it's hotter than hell
Movin' and servin' these bells, duckin' and dodgin the 12
Tryin' to not go back to jail, Allah you know I mean well
Plus I do it so well, I can (?)

(Verse 4: OG Maco)
Say the word like the preacher mannn, yeahh
And I have some words for ya, oh Lord oh Lord, yeahh
Say the word like the preacher mannn, yeahh, oh Lord oh Lord
Say the word, sayyy the word yeahh

(Chorus: K Camp & Sy Ari)
A million niggas marching, they on go
We worth a couple mil' on the low
Say word (x6)

Nobody ever gave us nothin', niggas know (ain't need to know)
Can't let these pussy niggas try me like no hoe (no hoe)
Say word (x6)

(Verse 5: Kap G)
Say word (x3)
Like I'm from New York, and my girl got a donkey like Eeyore
And my 'migos movin' dawn ravens like D Moore
I remember being at the Lenox Mall asking for some soundboards right there at the food court
On my way to the Bay like Too $hort, yeah I'm bout to leave the Cali Park yeah airport

(Verse 6: Tha Joker)
Dope nigga, I belong in a glass bag
Can't we talk the price of these hand bags
Smoking out the pound; no hashtag
Rollin' up Mary; no Magdalene
Got all these clips, call them magazines
Any nigga hatin' can subscribe to these

(Verse 7: Jarren Benton)
Yeah yeah
ATL in here, Mr. Benton did them niggas mention?
I'm so high I need an intervention
My niggas in the kitchen whip a couple chickens
I'm 'bout to give you niggas somethin' different
I need a hoe to cook, clean, do the dishes
Promethazine and sprite, that is my prescription
I'm in the Chevy (?) new edition
I'm gettin' head like a mutant

(Verse 8: Drag-On)
I ain't never let no muthafuckin' pussy nigga treat me like no hoe
If I call up all the Crips and I get the green light, it's a go
And I keep a nigga baby mama all up in the crib on the low
That's why a nigga runnin' through Atlanta with a muthafuckin' 4

(Chorus: K Camp & Sy Ari)
A million niggas marching, they on go
We worth a couple mil' on the low
Say word (x6)

Nobody ever gave us nothin', niggas know (ain't need to know)
Can't let these pussy niggas try me like no hoe (no hoe)
Say word (x6)

(Verse 9: Zach Farlow)
Been going hard since I came out the hole
I tell her I love her, she know it's not true
So she cussin' and fussin', there's so many of 'em
And I can't choose which one, swear I need me a wooo (Xanax)
We was chose, dropped more here than a U.S.O
(?)
All eyes on me like a room full of poles (and they still can't see me)

(Verse 10: Nyemiah Supreme)
Remember how they said there could only be 1?
How many of them bitches fuckin' wit me? None
Say word, yeah bitch say another fuckin' word
Bad hoe in that bitch, I know
Slummy, never in the slumber
Only in the check is my number
(?)

(Verse 11: Scotty ATL)
I really be killin' this shit
These niggas see me come up, ask 'em to tell you my grind
Money and family; that stay on my mind
Man I can't let out the gang
Movin' the gas state to state, man I remember them days
Feeling like I'm bein' watched, now we rockin' watches and chains to show 'em we getting the guap
Give me the top

(Verse 12: Mike Fresh)
Fresh go n' grind it, how the fuck you figure?
You can go back n' check my resum√©
Been rockin' with Slum straight from the beginning, and we the same niggas that's winnin' today
Been in the cup, fallin' back n' just watchin'
But watch when I come out and smash on the game
Ain't hard to notice we focused, don't group us with none of them fuck niggas
We ain't the same

(Verse 13: Zuse)
Me no responds when I rise up and spit sparks, hollow point shots start flicking mon'
Don me a big man, you are flipping with the king mon'
And we bad boys from Kingston yo

(Chorus: K Camp & Sy Ari)
A million niggas marching, they on go
We worth a couple mil' on the low
Say word (x6)

Nobody ever gave us nothin', niggas know (ain't need to know)
Can't let these pussy niggas try me like no hoe (no hoe)
Say word (x6)

(Verse 14: Royce Rizzy)
5 hoes in the tub with a fat boy, nigga can't take that from me
Just signed my deal last month, a nigga gettin' all this money
A nigga tried to fuck my bitch, so you know it's like fuck little homie
Post one little IG pic, bad bitch pull up on me

(Verse 15: Wave Chapelle)
Aye, free all my niggas locked up in the pen
See, until they come out, I won't stop going in
Just the beginnin', I'm makin' them ends
And it's Wave n' K Camp n' Sy Ari Da Kid
I got it out the mud, nigga, straight dirt
Shunnin' on a nigga make his face hurt
Been a real nigga since my date of birth
I got it on my own nigga, say word

(Verse 16: Katie Got Bandz)
You robbin' n' trappin'? Say word
Them hittas'll drill all my work
Got a million of killas, I pay them some figures, they'll put your shit up on the curb
I'm 'bout that action like verbs
Can't go like a lame niggas nerves
We all on the rocks, just get stirred
I ball on my team like the Spurs

(Verse 17: Rich the Kid)
Young rich nigga, got a quarter mil' on me
He the hottest in the city? He ain't got a damn loan
Pull up in a Bentley, Forgiato rims on it
My niggas, they trappin' the curb, give 'em the word
You cuffin' that bitch but she fuckin' regardless
(?)

(Chorus: K Camp & Sy Ari)
A million niggas marching, they on go
We worth a couple mil' on the low
Say word (x6)

Nobody ever gave us nothin', niggas know (ain't need to know)
Can't let these pussy niggas try me like no hoe (no hoe)
Say word (x6)

(Verse 18: A1 the Supergroup)
Gotta go hard, can't feel no man
Started going hard, my dad got jailed
Can't do it for myself, gotta do it for the fam'
Wanna book us for a show? Gotta be a couple grand
Get my mama out the hood, go n' cop us a land
Tiptoe down, nigga here I stand
If you're lookin' for a player baby, here I am
Baby, here I am

Got a new island, looked on life
Told me everything just right
Same young niggas with a vision on life, new generation swag so fly
Grind out the mud, yeah the north side dirt
Only rock the 4's, gotta understand your worth
Momma sheddin' tears, only thing I know is work
So when you wanna hurt, know the fam' come first

(Verse 19: Yowda)
Got my weight up so it's payback, remember when DJ's wouldn't play that
Now every time you hear a "YOWDA", first you gotta hear (Maybach)
Came a long way from the traps and the trenches, and the ratchet ass bitches
Now it's beamer's n' benz's, the women are exquisite
And I ain't worried 'bout expenses

(Verse 20: Bandit Gang Marco)
Doing my thing, I know niggas is luggin'
If I wasn't rappin', I'd be out there swipin'
Running from 12, keep rising hell
(?)
(Real nigga say word)
Running in circles, circles, circles, yeah
My shooters'll hurt ya, hurt ya, hurt ya

(Chorus: K Camp & Sy Ari)
A million niggas marching, they on go
We worth a couple mil' on the low
Say word (x6)

Nobody ever gave us nothin', niggas know (ain't need to know)
Can't let these pussy niggas try me like no hoe (no hoe)
Say word (x6)

(Verse 21: Translee)
Basically I be up 24/7, I pray to my God and he know it's important
Drop to my knees and say "order my steps"
Ordered my steps then ordered them Jordan's
I'm talkin' this shit cause I can, ain't no remorse in my hand
Ain't no extortion demands, I got abortions to plan
Cause I'm not kiddin', not jokin' my friend

(Verse 22: Zip K)
Everywhere in your neighborhood, they fuckin' with Papi
Creepin' with your hoe, got her duckin' like Daffy
Young zipper chief'n like an Apache
Still new to this fancy shit
What's that? Versace?
What's that? It's Gucci right?
I'm wit' it, I'm down with them slums
We up wit' your bitches
Fuck them politics, the polls are for strippers
Commas in my mittens, I'm over-committing

(Verse 23: Fat Bax)
They know (x3)
Young nigga ain't playin' right now, can't stop 'til I get a million
Wit' a bad bitch, from the Key West
Smokin' on these stress relievers
(?) it's going down, blowing gas out the rental

(Verse 24: D Chamberz)
My homie's gone but I'm still here, thank the Lord that I'm still here
Shots fly, they'll make a mil' here
Get a closed casket or a wheelchair
Hi-beams on the new Jag
Big chain with the weapon on me, haters hate but got nothin' on me
A little shoulder dust, I just brush it off me

(Verse 25: Math Hoffa)
Hoffa, that's the name
NYB nigga, that's the gang
Thank God for this rappin' thing, niggas picking up cases like baggage claims
Flashbacks when I had the gat, now I get paid to say the truth
Shoot the man when I play the booth, my money up and I'm hater proof

(Chorus: K Camp & Sy Ari)
A million niggas marching, they on go
We worth a couple mil' on the low
Say word (x6)

Nobody ever gave us nothin', niggas know (ain't need to know)
Can't let these pussy niggas try me like no hoe (no hoe)
Say word(x6)
