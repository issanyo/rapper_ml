You play with a bitch, I play with a brick
You play with a bitch, I play with a brick
You play with a bitch, I play with a brick
You play with a bitch, I play with a brick
You take her on dates, she getting me paid
You take her on dates, she getting me paid
You take her on dates, she getting me paid
I play with a brick, you play with a bitch

Nigga stop playing (nigga stop playing), nigga stop playing
You quit it, you quit it, you quit it, you quit it
You ain't shooting shit
You flippin' a bitch, while I'm flippin' a brick
I play with a brick, while you play with a bitch

[Verse 1]

You ain't shoot shit, you trip with a bitch
I play with a brick, with plenty of whip
Knew how to whip, foreign new auto whip
Got me a coupe, got the bitch filled
Took me a trip
You niggas a trip, you need to get you a grip
Bitches they never come over my guap, forever finesse outta not
It really don't matter or not, still gonna fuck on the spot
Package about to drop, bitch get outta my spot
You take her on dates, and feed her the plate
You making me laugh, fast food right down her bag
Look at her hand, damn fool she pay me the K
Taking the brick to the place, she never delay

[Hook]

[Verse 2]

Mr. All I Know, screaming all over the land
Nigga a walking brick (shit), I'm the man
I'm the man, I'm the man
God knows white, but the white be my girlfriend
[?], trying to jugg them outta [?]
Streets dry and price high, gotta do it fucking taking something
Nigga ain't looking for sorrow, ain't in it for a borrow
Asking for shit, that's what you spitting
My pride, rather swallow
I trapped out like a vet, flipping a brick to a vet
You poke on my block, you shooting it up
My gangstas, you gonna respect
You niggas they know my motto, my lifestyle hollow
Freaky hoes sucking dick, and y'all niggas know to kiss (don't do that)
