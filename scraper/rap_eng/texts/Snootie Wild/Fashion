[Verse 1]
You can check my memo
Life get short like demo
Nigga I'm about that, like Chevy on C4
Its yo fucking fashion, take yo bitch and smash it
Give her back she trashing
That bitch is a habit
Flip more like them [?]
Rolling watch me [?]
Where'd you find this
It blamn like a eagle
I keep Desert Eagle
Please don't test my ego
My choppa a classic, it drum like the Beatle
Feds watch it, I flash it
Grab the bricks and bag it
Nigga get wronged, choppa spit fire like a dragon
Drug dealing a fashion, it come paper plastic
Oh you with no ho ay, now I live with fashion

[Hook x2]
Cuz everything I do, it be in fashion
And when I hit your block, I be in fashion
So If I ever die, I die in fashion
Feds watching, cuz I'll be flashing

[Verse 2]
On top of the roster
Top of the topic
Rule boy dread head bumbaclot shotta
Bitch nigga just shot a
Foreign whip [?]
I do this in fashion, and I can be star bruh
Fuck your bitch and fuck your bitch, she hollering like a opera
Whip that brick and whip that brick
Got bacon betty [?]
I'm hotter than lave
She eat dick, saliva
Eat that dick and eat that dick, she swallow til she gargle
She eat dick in fashion
Public trust I'm flashing
Flyer than a [?]
Futuristic fashion, fashion

[Hook x2]
Cuz everything I do, it be in fashion
And when I hit your block, I be in fashion
So If I ever die, I die in fashion
Feds watching, cuz I'll be flashing
