[Hook]
We street warriors, go and order up
The only thing we know, it come from the border bruh
Moving these packs out, try not to crash out
Got my money up, till a nigga cash out
And we street warriors, ay ay ay ay ay
And we street warriors, oh oh oh oh
And we street warriors, and we street warriors
And we street warriors

[Hook]
We street warriors, go and order up
The only thing we know, it come from the border bruh
Moving these packs out, try not to crash out
Got my money up, till a nigga cash out
And we street warriors, ay ay ay ay ay
And we street warriors, oh oh oh oh
And we street warriors, and we street warriors
And we street warriors

[Verse 1]
Serving and robing niggas
Straight out the gate, brought a Chevy and my chopper nigga
Real alligators, couldn’t stand the sight to see my family starving nigga
Not Snootie, so I stole dope or robbed a nigga
Tried a 9 to 5 but that shit wasn’t for a nigga
Uncle gave the game then bought a 9 piece for a nigga
24 7, swanging juices out a ford nigga
When you dead and gone the streets love you more nigga

Interlude: Yo Gotti]
Ay yo when I first met Snootie, and he had just got out of prison
He played me his records and I told him my nigga I understand what you come from
I understand your vision, I see what you be trying to do
And from one street nigga to another one
My nigga I’ma do everything in my power to try to put you in position

[Hook]
We street warriors, go and order up
The only thing we know, it come from the border bruh
Moving these packs out, try not to crash out
Got my money up, till a nigga cash out
And we street warriors, ay ay ay ay ay
And we street warriors, oh oh oh oh
And we street warriors, and we street warriors
And we street warriors

[Hook]
We street warriors, go and order up
The only thing we know, it come from the border bruh
Moving these packs out, try not to crash out
Got my money up, till a nigga cash out
And we street warriors, ay ay ay ay ay
And we street warriors, oh oh oh oh
And we street warriors, and we street warriors
And we street warriors
