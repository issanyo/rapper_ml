[Verse 1: Boosie Badazz]
Boosie back, and I’m going to get that sack
Middle finger up if you holler fuck a rat
I get it out the mud, how you gonna hate that?
From the bottom to the top, bitch nigga take that
Free Boosie, free Boosie, real nigga shake back
Free Boosie, free Boosie, cause they need that crack
That music, that get you through it
My niggas who gone, we tattooed
And I miss my nigga, my nigga, my nigga
Hating ass niggas shot down my thug
They hate her in the club cause she get all the attention
Now they want to fight, sad bitches

[Hook: Boosie Badazz]

[Verse 2: Snootie Wild]
I don’t know why they be hating, I don’t hate niggas
I don’t know why you hating on me
Who gives a damn? Fuck em
Been away for so long, so long
Family friends be the first to turn on you
I swear it’s like a common disease, like pneumonia
But I’m gone put that tone on you
Niggas laid up, lay under you
Watching every move you make, tryna swap you up
I’mma catch em with the bait and get em bopped up
Bitch you under investigation, I know you hating bruh

[Hook: Boosie Badazz]
Ho you hating, you hating, you hating

Talking down on me, you know what you doing
Spreading lies on me, you know what you doing
Hate my outfit, you know what you doing
