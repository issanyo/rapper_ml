(Open the door and came into the fifth dimension where ah asshole)

Bitch, I'm psycho. I've got a future, I have a future
Bitch, I'm psycho. I've got a future, I have a future
Drill down the road. Pumping with a blue light. My feelings are split
Drill down the road. Pumping with a blue light. My feelings are split

[Verse 1]
Thank god of the universe, brings the talent in my blood
Non-spiritual and mental growth, I'm out of shape in the
Your family is black suits, black suits your family
Your friends use white flowers, you invoices, dude, I Prophet
I'm the shape of the future. There you fancy. Your imagination is the statue
My third eye accidentally met your Anxious eyes
My vision was so perfect and you lose all the value of life
Lost sight. Lost reason to live. Orca squad, rip your limbs into pieces
I planted paranoid to you . You’ve come to the wrong place
Me and my connection to the universe as a spy in your nightmares
Feel the worst of the pain suffered no physical contact
Do not attempt to communicate with me
Pupils of the devil, fuck minja, I'm stoned, bitch

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I would not say any more about development
We toward transcendence, you guys not going backwards
Life is not the movie , so you can’t back to the fufure
You can read this, but could never understand
I look out the feeling . You Guys now listening of the sound of the beginning
I now [?]. And to hear your heartbeat I
My color is heard? I heard the anger of color blindness
I just draw a circle like Palo, type that kids [?]
