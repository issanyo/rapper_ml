[Intro: Azizi Gibson & Kamandi]
No, no (Kamandi)
No, no
No point in me turnin' my swag on
No, no

[Chorus: Azizi Gibson & Keith Ape]
No point in me turnin' my swag on
That would be genocide
One look at me and you'd wanna die
Use the aggression and fuck all yo' pride, no, no (nuh)
I don't get paid a lot, no, no
No point in me turnin' my swag on (nuh, fuck 'em)
That would be genocide (됐어)
One look at me and you'd wanna die (ooh)
Use the aggression and fuck all yo' pride, no, no (됐어)
I don't get paid a lot, no, no (ooh)

[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
You bitches know me better
It's some O.L. shit, gettin' lit, son
We drinkin' on coronas, umm (fly high)
Big boss over here, get away from macarroni (back off)
Lil homie, invisible line, gotta pay, respect her slow, nigga
So I'ma check, lil nigga, it's good (ayy)
I don't know what the fuck is goin' on
But everybody hold on (shit)
Yeah, you see my eyes and there is no fear (fear)
Fuck you, get the roamin' on a skunt (skunt)
Niggas tryna hit a little blunt (blunt)
Stunnin' on you niggas, say on (on)
Wasting every breathe up in my lungs (lungs)
Fuck it, this a jump (jump)

[Chorus: Azizi Gibson & Keith Ape]
No point in me turnin' my swag on (nuh, fuck 'em)
That would be genocide (됐어)
One look at me and you'd wanna die (ooh)
Use the aggression and fuck all yo' pride, no, no (엿 먹어, 엿)
I don't get paid a lot, no, no (엿 먹어, 엿)
No point in me turnin' my swag on (nuh, fuck 'em)
That would be genocide (됐어)
One look at me and you'd wanna die (ooh, *moan*)
Use the aggression and fuck all yo' pride, no, no (no, no, ayy)
I don't get paid a lot, no, no (yuh, ayy, whoa)

[Verse 2: Keith Ape]
Ayy, 알 건 알만큼 다 커 버렸지 (pshh)
그런 내 앞에서 어디 장난질이야, 병신 (pshh)
세상은 땅따먹기, 난 내 팀과 나눠 먹지 (yah)
내가 어느 나라 말 쓰든 넌 이해 못해, 나 섞지 (yah)
마, 거지야, 너와 내 위친 너무 멀지, 천리안 (...안)
거리감을 느낀다면 저리 멀리 가 (가)
네가 자극시키기엔 내성이 너무 높지, 난 (난)
미궁 속에 앉아 있어, 마치 비행기 안 (안)
너넨 날 볼 수 없어, 내 얼굴, flow, mask 안에
Hop into my UFO, 다음 세계로 나갈 차례
Bitch, I'm, I'm ridin' UFO, 내 존잰 절대 미확인
And I get tight, and I be alone, 난 안 걸려, 레이더망에 (ayy)

[Chorus: Azizi Gibson & Keith Ape]
No point in me turnin' my swag on (nuh, fuck 'em)
That would be genocide (됐어)
One look at me and you'd wanna die (ooh)
Use the aggression and fuck all yo' pride, no, no (엿 먹어, 엿)
I don't get paid a lot, no, no (엿 먹어, 엿)
No point in me turnin' my swag on (nuh, fuck 'em)
That would be genocide (됐어)
One look at me and you'd wanna die (ooh, *moan*)
Use the aggression and fuck all yo' pride, no, no (엿 먹어, 엿)
I don't get paid a lot, no, no (엿 먹어, 엿)
