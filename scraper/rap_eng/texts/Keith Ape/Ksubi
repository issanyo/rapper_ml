[Verse 1: Keith Ape]
Ksubi, my Ksubi, my Ksubi (Ksubi)
내 청바지는 Ksubi (Ksubi)
내 주머니에는 현금이 (현금이)
신발엔 Goyard 무늬 (무늬)
Orca-tail, orca-tail, Ksubies my orca-tail (yah)
십자가 두 개가 나를 지켜, 앞에 (yah)
Fuck-boy들은 앞에 (yah, ayy)
Fuck-boy들은 다 서클 밖에 (skrrr)
여긴 못 들어와, 우리밖에 (skrrr)
다시 말해 봐, 우리 앞에서 (skrrr)
나는 쫓고 결국엔 뺏어 (즐)
나는 원하면 결국엔 생겨 (즐)
한몫 크게 챙겨 (즐)
결국 돈이나 셀 걸 (즐)
네 인생은 씹히지, 개 껌 (yah)
애들이 다 소문낼걸

[Bridge: Keith Ape]
Lean in my cup, I got ice on my teeth (ayy, grahhh, skrrr, skrrr)
Drip it and whip it, work it out my wrist (ayy, skrrr, skrrr)
Sippin', my money talk, that's all we 'bout it (ayy, ooh)
And I don't play with my money (ayy)
So don't fuck with me (yah, ayy)

[Verse 2: Ken Rebel]
Money on my table, talk nicely, yes, politely
Holla, takin' ya bitch
I keep that pussy in check like a cat in Nikes
I Say no names, I spit these flames
I'm like a dragon with halitosis
I be on my Ferg, bitch, I put the work in
Throw a few hundreds, she gon' start twerkin'
Y'all nigga's talk is cheap, I G-talk
I ain't talkin' gangsta shit, I'm talkin' grands
I don’t fuck with no clash of clans
I move with an army like a marchin' band
I keep that fetti on, fetti on, fetti
Bitch, you not goin', I'm ready, I know these bars get heavy
Only hit me up, check your cheddy
24 karats keep my vertebrae healthy

[Bridge: Ken Rebel]
If you ain't know, I got gold on my neck (chi-, ching)
This ain't no stunt, I'mma slave that's in debt
Young Don Don Dada, I'll snatch up your bitch (shit)
Bring her to my castle and feed her my dick

[Break: Ken Rebel]
Yo, it's the RebelLife Mafia and Cohort, nigga
Fuck with us or fuck you, bitch

[Chorus: Keith Ape]
