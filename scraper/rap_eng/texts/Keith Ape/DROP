[Hook: Thouxanbanfauni]
Watch that purple drip, I be drinkin' drop
Keep that .40 cocked, you know how I rock
I might drop the top, while I get some top
Pull up to the trap, leave her at the spot
Laser on the Glock, destroy a nigga block
Pussy look at this shell, pussy lookin' shocked
Your thottie hold me, hop, lil' hoe hop on my cock
Always close the door, I always keep it locked
I been drinkin' drop, I be drinkin' drop
I be drinkin' drop, I be drinkin' drop
I be drinkin' drop, I be drinkin' drop
I be drinkin' drop, I be drinkin' drop

[Verse 1: Moe & Yung Gleesh]

Drop it low like the goat

[Verse 2: Thouxanbanfauni & Yung Gleesh]

[Bridge: Thouxanbanfauni & Keith Ape]
Drop, drop, drop, drop
