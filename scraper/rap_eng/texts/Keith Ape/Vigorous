[Intro: Keith Ape & Ronny J]
Ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy (Ronny J, listen up)
Ayy, chillin' like a mo'fucker
Ayy, feelin' like a mo'fucker
Feelin' like a mo'fucker (ayy)
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve (yeah)

[Chorus: Keith Ape]
Bitches being bitches 'cause they are bitches (bitches)
Mo'fuckers always get my fuckin' riches (riches)
I be that fuckin' young savage, mo'fucker (yeah)
I be that fuckin' young savage, mo'fucker (yeah)
Feelin' like a mo'fucker (yeah)
Feelin' like a mo'fucker (yeah)
I be that fuckin' young savage, mo'fucker (yuh, yuh)

[Verse 1: Keith Ape]
풀린 눈 두 개, 금니를 열두 개씩 (씩)
모두에게 나를 나눠 줘, 22그램씩 (씩)
나는 마치 남을 의식하듯 나를 의식—식—하진 않아
너넨 취해 있고, 내 앞에 펼쳐진 무지개를 따라가다 보니 (oh)
불식되던 애들 눈이 점점 붉은색을 띠우지 (oh, oh)
느껴, 사람들의 의심, 하지만 난 전부 무시 (hey, hey)
Don’t gives a fuck about your 눈치 (hey)
I keep it raw like Sushi (ayy, hey)
My circle tight like Ksubi (ayy, hey)
여긴 나만의 세상 (상)
너 놓고 싶지만, 퇴짜 (짜, nah)
들어오고 싶음 또 내가 (nah)
?
Savage, savage Haring with some white lines (yah)
I got money bags by douzaine (ayy, yuh)
Ronny from the grind, 인마 (oh, yeah)

[Chorus: Keith Ape]
Feelin' like a mo'fucker (yeah)
Feelin' like a mo'fucker (yeah)
I be that fuckin' young savage, mo'fucker (yeah)
I be that fuckin' young savage, mo'fucker (yeah)
Bitches being bitches 'cause they are bitches (bitches)
Mo'fuckers always get my fuckin' riches (riches)
I be that fuckin' young savage, mo'fucker (mo'fucker)

[Verse 2: Denzel Curry & Keith Ape]
Same shit, different chapter (feelin' like a mo'fucker)
AR, make you scatter
Bullets fly, ain't you pastor? (feelin' like a mo'fucker)
Pass me the blunt, 'cause your life don't matter
Hot-damn, like gray matter
Glock in hand and they will pop it (mo'fucker)
Send it to the skyline (I be that)
Bullets to your face like a show (fuckin' young savage)
Nigga, prime time (mo'fucker)
Out of this world, Invader Zim
You wanna play God, nigga, play The Sims
Nigga, oh, nah, don't pray to him
You wanna move work, but never been to the gym
You wanna run shit, well, I overlapped it
Matter fact, I overlapped the intergalactic
Matter fact, I overlapped space and time
Until the reverse and brought Biggie out of his casket
You can't stand me, I'm not Marshall Mathers
Your girlfriend said she was up for NAFTA
She told me sufferin' succotash
Now that’s another afternoon fuckin' that ass
Obviously, like a hobbit, you see
She wanted a ring, all over my jeans
'Cause she wanted my genes, my DNA
But I gettin' up in yo' ass like TSA, whoa
TMI, ありがとう こんにちは
나, 몰라, 잊지 마 (잊지 마)
Runnin' with apes like I’m runnin' with Caesar
No, you can't back her, it's not a two-seater
Nowadays niggas play follow the leader
I follow, you follow, unfollow, delete ya
Accounts are suspended, you need Neutrogena for yo' AVI
Live and let live while I'm left to die (die)
Two handguns like Turok, nigga
I am the father, I'm Bardock, nigga
We could shoot to fade, no Clorox, nigga
Ichi-Ichigo bullets, 'cause you know the tips be hollow
Livin' today, but you won't see tomorrow
My AO went up to A after Apostle, bitch (yeah)

[Chorus: Keith Ape]
Bitches being bitches 'cause they are bitches (bitches)
Mo'fuckers always get my fuckin' riches (riches)
I be that fuckin' young savage, mo'fucker (yeah)
I be that fuckin' young savage, mo'fucker (yeah)
Bitches being bitches 'cause they are bitches (bitches)
Mo'fuckers always get my fuckin' riches (riches)
I be that fuckin' young savage, mo'fucker (mo'fucker)
