[Intro: Yung Bans]
Came a long way, runnin' from the trap (Yeah)
Remember I was broke, I was broke
Came a long way, runnin' from the trap (Yeah)
Remember I was broke, I ain't going back

[Chorus: Keith Ape]
Opium in my system like I'm 청나라 사람
And my wrist color same as pineapple Fanta
I got opium in my system like I'm 청나라 사람
And my wrist color same as pineapple Fanta

[Verse 1: Keith Ape]
Underwater ninjas revenger enemy
내 주먹에 [???] 강해진 내 energy
나는 유희왕, 너는 결국 내 함정 카드에 걸리지
주먹에 [???], 난 넘쳐 energy
Diamonds on me clear, swing like a chandelier
Diamonds on me clear, swing like a chandelier
내 발에는 Air Force One, 범고래 두 마리
내가 던진 주사위엔 6이 세자리 (triple six, ay)
청나라 사람처럼 몸에 흘러 아편이
계속 몸을 마취, pineapple Fanta 색깔이
돈을 세지, 숫자 100을 백개 세지, ay
지문이 파래질 때까지 숫자 100을 세지, ay
I got [???], 절대 같이 못해, ay
걸리적거리다 너는 적 돼, ay
나는 만들어 니 여자들 젖게
Shawty, shawty give me head
She loves how I drip
Pouring up some (?) what I sip
Always off the gas
You know how i gig
(?) like mathematics

[Chorus: Keith Ape]
Opium in my system like I'm 청나라 사람
And my wrist color same as pineapple Fanta
I got opium in my system like I'm 청나라 사람
And my wrist color same as pineapple Fanta
Diamonds on me clear, swing like a chandelier
Diamonds on me clear, swing like a chandelier
내 발에는 Air Force One, 범고래 두 마리
내가 던진 주사위엔 6이 세자리 (triple six, ay)

[Verse 2: Yung Bans]
(Ayy)
Drip set, this a drip set (yeah)
If a nigga try me he gon' get wet
We got futuristic guns, they don't cock back
I'm a young rich nigga, I don't tote straps
Got my shooter in the front, I'm in the back
Ass fat, bitch on my lap (Ayy)
Came a long way running through the trap (Yeah)
Remember I was broke?
I ain't going back
Draco in my book bag
You can't get your bitch back
I don't bang, bust stacks
Young nigga count these racks
In this bitch with Keith Ape
Pimp your hoe, give her back
Pimp your hoe, give her back
She open up, she like a matchbook
Spray a nigga, with the mac
Hundred thousand in cash, yeah
(Ayy) Rob a nigga, no mask
I shitted on em, my bad
I'm a rebel nigga fuck class

[Chorus: Keith Ape]
Opium in my system like I'm 청나라 사람
And my wrist color same as pineapple Fanta
I got opium in my system like I'm 청나라 사람
And my wrist color same as pineapple Fanta
Diamonds on me clear, swing like a chandelier
Diamonds on me clear, swing like a chandelier
내 발에는 Air Force One, 범고래 두 마리
내가 던진 주사위엔 6이 세자리 (triple six, ay)

[Outro: Yung Bans]
Came a long way, runnin' from the trap (Yeah)
Remember I was broke, I was broke
Came a long way, runnin' from the trap (Yeah)
Remember I was broke, I ain't going back
