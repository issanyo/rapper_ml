[Intro]
Relax

[Hook: J $tash]
Hol' up, wait a minute, shawty
Give me top 'cause you a thottie
Let's get wasted, have a party
We could fuck in my Ferrari
White girl looking like a Barbie
I don't want a wife, I'm sorry
You can have my number prolly
I won't answer when you call me
Hol' up, wait a minute, shawty
Give me top 'cause you a thottie
Let's get wasted, have a party
We could fuck in my Ferrari
White girl looking like a Barbie
I don't want a wife, I'm sorry
You can have my number prolly
I won't answer when you call me

[Verse 1: Danny Seth]
Call my barber
Tell him that I need a freshie
I got four hoes in the dressing room
All of them tryna undress me
Call my lawyer
'Cause I think we got a problem
And I don't need a calculator
When we get tryna solve it
No more issues
I’m tryna get blown like some tissues
Man, I’ve got to take it easy
'Cause I go hard on my visuals
I make movies, not Scorsese
I dress fresh, that’s for the ladies
I bet when you kiss your missus
You gon’ prolly taste my babies
I got bars like I’m Xanax
I just maxed out my Am-Ex
I just made up my old name
It’s gon’ be hard to get out it
Danny Seth, I’m outlandish
Goin’ stronger than [?] is
I do this shit for my city
Fuck everyone who doubting

[Verse 2: J $tash]
Only chasing money, shawty, getting to the bag (relax)
Flipping packs, bad, bad bitch, I 'ont want your ass
I'mma spread out with the whip fast and I don’t ever crash
I don’t dance, I’m ‘bout to fade when I’m pullin’ up my pants
I got the stick with the blade and a big hundred attached
She want to fuck with me 'cause she see that I’m thumbing through them bands
I hit a stain on your plug, I took that boy for all his grams
I’m on a plane sipping mud 'cause that flight long to Japan
They be like ooh, who you, hoppin’ out the coupe (skrrr)
With the Ferragamo on his belt and on his shoe (and on his shoe)
You ain’t talking money, man, then I can’t talk to you
Only chasing money, shawty
I ain’t after you, yah

[Hook: J $tash]
