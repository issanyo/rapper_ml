[Intro]
Yah, ayy
Water, water
This water, water (underwater)
Yah

[Verse 1]
내 스타일은 [?] (savage)
옷을 사고 도망가, 이리 와 봐라 (이리 와 봐라, savage)
한 손엔 죽도, 딴 손에는 야구 방망이로 (yuh, yuh, ayy, yuh, ayy)
[?]로 만들어 버리지 (yuh, yuh, yuh)
[?] 뗀 새끼, 넣은 것만 삐까번쩍 (삐까번쩍)
Bunny 같은 새끼, you lookin' like a Goldust (Goldust)
나는 녹여 버리고, 내 목걸이, 이빨로 (yuh)
내 친군 네 모가지를 꺾어 버려, 마치 Tombstone (yuh, ooh)
내 주먹에 감겨 있는 나의 모든 철사 (나의 모든 철사)
그걸로 갈겨 버려, 네 못생긴 면상 (bow, bow)
애써 튀게 피는 [?] 범벅돼 버려 (ah-eww)
세 번째 newbie처럼 보여, 착시 현상 (ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Jeff Hardy hair on me lookin' like rainbow (rainbow)
Swanton Bomb off a ladder on yo' main hoe (main hoe)
Fuck wannabe rock stars, 'cause I'm a champion (champion)
Don't try this at home, it's danger (ayy, underwater)

[Chorus]
Since waist bring my set, that's no-no (no-no, savage)
Backwoods and two beers like Stone Cold (brr, savage)
Finish him with a Stone Cold stunner (stunner)
Korea's most back-wooded (yuh)
I was born a stoner (underwater)
Since waist bring my set, that's no-no (no-no, savage)
Backwoods and two beers like Stone Cold  (burr, savage)
Finish him with a Stone Cold stunner (stunner, savage)
Korea's most back-wooded (*cough*, savage)
I was born a stoner (yuh, underwater)

[Verse 2: Keith Ape]
Spray, Underwater wrist
난 Triple H on a triple 6ix
International champion belt on my waist (on my waist)
Belt shot, belt shot to yo' bloody face (belt shot, ayy)
Ayy, okay (bitch, yo, yo)
No face, no case, Mysterio, Rey (-o, Rey)
Red face, long hair, lookin' like a old Kane (old Kane)
Never down just like Bubba Ray (yeah-e-yeah)
I'm Baped out, just in a Burberry (yeah-e-yeah)
619에서 1 빼, lil bitch (ayy, yo)
얼른 내려가서 입 대 (내려가서 입 대)
바텐더처럼 내 그걸 양주처럼 주입해 (양주처럼 주입해)
내 신경이고말고 네 목구멍에 주입해, ayy (네 목구멍에 주입해)
Underwater bank, bank
진짜 살아, 물 밑에 (yuh, 진짜 살아, 물 밑에)
나는 돈을 벌어, 생각보다 너무나 쉽게 ([?], 쉬워)
우린 물 쓰듯 돈을 써, 무식하고 또 쉽게 (또 쉽게, 써, get paid)
위험한 애들끼리 위험한 짓 하고 paid (ayy, yuh, get paid)
위험한 돈으로 금목걸이에 (umm)
금반지, 금팔찌, Rollie에 (yuh)
디자이너 옷까지 사고 올라갔지, 이미 위에 (yuh)
죽기 직전까지 나는 운 위에, ayy (ayy, yuh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Jeff Hardy hair on me lookin' like rainbow (rainbow)
Swanton Bomb off a ladder on yo' main hoe (main hoe, ayy)
Fuck wannabe rock stars, 'cause I'm a champion
Don't try this at home, it's danger (savage)
Jeff Hardy hair on me lookin' like rainbow
Swanton Bomb off a ladder on yo' main hoe
Fuck wannabe rock stars, 'cause I'm a champion
Don't try this at home, it's danger

[Chorus]
Since waist bring my set, that's no-no (savage)
Backwoods and two beers like Stone Cold (savage)
Finish him with a Stone Cold stunner
Korea's most back-wooded
I was born a stoner (*cough*, underwater)
Since waist bring my set, that's no-no (savage)
Backwoods and two beers like Stone Cold (savage)
Finish him with a Stone Cold stunner (savage)
Korea's most back-wooded (*cough*, savage)
I was born a stoner (underwater, savage)

[Outro]
죽기 직전까지 나는 운 위에, ayy (underwater)
