[Intro: Famous Dex]
You know what I’m sayin’ iced out
I just- that’s just how I like to do it, know what I’m sayin’ (Dexter)
My real name is Dexter, haha
I got a lot of more diamonds too
I just got new diamonds by the way
Uh, woah
Dexter, huh
Uh, yeah, uh what
Baby girl, what you doing, where your man? (where your man)
I just popped a xan, fifty thousand in Japan (fifty thousand in Japan)
You know what I’m sayin’
I ain’t doin’ no playin’, baby you dig (Dexter)
Dexter (Dexter)
Ooh, huh, wait, what
Uh, yeah, what

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Baby girl, what you doing, where your man? (where your)
I just popped a xan, fifty thousand in Japan (fifty thousand in Japan)
I ain't doin' no playin', these red bottoms, not no Vans
And she tellin' all her friends, I might put 'em on the 'gram, aye (yeah, Dexter)
Baby girl, what you doing, where your man? (where your man, baby)
I just popped a xan, fifty thousand in Japan (fifty thousand in Japan)
I ain't doin' no playin', these red bottoms, not no Vans
And she tellin' all her friends, I might put 'em on the Gram (uh, yeah, Dexter)

[Verse 1: Verbal]
Tokyo that's my town, listen now
What you doing, where's ya man's
See my gold, meet my people, see my phone
Got a line, from a girl, and it's flavour
Where we going, Yakitori, cacciatore
Lemon sour we devour, got my diamonds, got my furs
Gahman says, "let's get lit, super lit, very, very lit"
Red red alert, paparazzi many trolls, following the way we roll
See my chain chain, it's been cold
See my gang gang, see how deep we roll
Karaoke sang sang, till the early morn'
Don't worry, be happy
Came up from my momma chati
Now we talk about Ferraris (vroom)
And we make it look easy
P.K.C on his boys I know you see me, yah (see me)
And we make it look easy
Famous Dex, Keith Ape I know you see me

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Baby girl, what you doing, where your man? (where your man?)
I just popped a xan, fifty thousand in Japan (fifty thousand in Japan)
I ain't doin' no playin', these red bottoms, not no Vans
And she tellin' all her friends, I might put 'em on the 'gram, aye (yeah, Dexter)
Baby girl, what you doing, where your man? (where your man, baby)
I just popped a xan, fifty thousand in Japan (fifty thousand in Japan)
I ain't doin' no playin', these red bottoms, not no Vans
And she tellin' all her friends, I might put 'em on the Gram (uh, yeah, Dexter)

[Verse 2: Keith Ape]
In Japan popped a xan drink sake, uh, yeah
Kill the shows in Tokyo need some grams, uh, yeah
Baby girl give me brain heal my pain, uh, yeah
I need dope, I need grams, i need yens, uh, yeah
I need more, I need grams, I need yens, uh, yeah
많은 돈, 많은 옷 필요해, uh, yeah
어차피 이 돈도 이 옷도 한 순간
지금 이 순간을 위해 그냥 더 난
일본에서 왔냐 모두 내게 물어봐, 내 출신은 서울이야
하지만 이 밤이 지나면 난
모두 내게 물어봐, 내 출신은 서울이야
하지만 이 밤이 지나면 난 또 다시 LA로 돌아가
Sippin on potion like Harry Potter
Purple got me slow Ninja Turtles
Monogram camo Murakami Louis Vuitton duffle bag
‘03 Nigo on my wrist
‘03 Nigo on my fist
Bape stars all on my feet
Spent a ticket on my feet

[Chorus: Famous Dex]
Baby girl, what you doing, where your man? (where your)
I just popped a xan, fifty thousand in Japan (fifty thousand in Japan)
I ain't doin' no playin', these red bottoms, not no Vans
And she tellin' all her friends, I might put 'em on the 'gram, aye (yeah, Dexter)
Baby girl, what you doing, where your man? (where your man, baby)
I just popped a xan, fifty thousand in Japan (fifty thousand in Japan)
I ain't doin' no playin', these red bottoms, not no Vans
And she tellin' all her friends, I might put 'em on the Gram (uh, yeah, Dexter)
