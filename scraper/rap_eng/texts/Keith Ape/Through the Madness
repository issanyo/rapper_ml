[Intro: K.eYe.D]
Ayy, yuh
Know what I'm sayin', nigga, know what I'm sayin', nigga
I'm still geekin' on this ties from a couple days ago (yah)
So that shit probably ain't gon' work
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: K.eYe.D]
I've been rulin' scriptures and these bible verses
Ayy, beat 'em with the bricks
Well, the fool deserved it (I know you, nigga, savage)
Ayy, when I'm [?] with a back her for it (okay, okay, yuh)
Ayy, shorty named heaven (heaven)
No, I don't deserve her (no, I don't deserve her)
Ayy, pussy-ass, teves
No, I gotta serve her (no, I gotta serve her)
Ayy, shorty hear my pager, but a nigga twerkin' (twerkin')
Ayy, shorty hear my pager, but a nigga murking (what, what)
Ayy, copacetic acid, I've been writing magic, psychedelic
Verbal talents, know she gotta have it (she gotta have it)
Nosebleed famous, tryna dream in the static (in the static)
Underwater squad in the fool, we ain't lackin' (ayy, okay)
I just told her she gon' drop it in the bitch febre (yah)

[Chorus: K.eYe.D & Okasian]
Copacetic acid, I've been passing magic (what, what)
Ayy, copacetic acid
I've been passing magic (I've been passing magic)
Ayy, copacetic acid
Pain through the madness (pain through the madness)
Yeah, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic (yuh, yuh)
Yuh, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Ayy, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic (ayy)
Ayy, copacetic acid, pain through the madness (ayy)
Yeah, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic (ayy)
Yuh, yuh

[Verse 2: Okasian]
우린 go-getters, 눈에 들어오는 것들은 전부 다 내 거
현재와 미래, 동시에 사니까 sooner or later
홍대, 그리고 이태원, 세계를 데려와도 can't compare us
발 없는 말이 얼마나 가는지를 봐, probs to Paris
독재자들은 [?], 나 두려워서 떨고 있어
동생의 동생들은 점점 똑똑해져 가고 있어
TV를 꺼, TV를 꺼, 우리 현실을 보고 싶어?
TV 속 구 서울은 고물, 우린 New Seoul을 살고 있어
평화를 원한단 말에도 넌 그대로지
창조를 말하기 전에 복수를 먼저 벼르지, uh
뻥치는 권력에 내 랩은 테러지, 에네르기
파도의 [?]를 방문해 [?]을 깨우지
난 게으르지 않지만, 너희들에겐 그렇게 보이는 게 당연해
그보다 더 많이 봤다면 나처럼 너도, "상관 안 해"
변종 같다지만, 그래, 야, 우린 또 뭉쳐
1002-332-500368, 우리은행, 돈 부쳐, yeah

[Chorus: K.eYe.D & Keith Ape]
Copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Ayy, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Ayy, copacetic acid, pain through the madness
Yeah, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Yuh, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Ayy, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Ayy, copacetic acid, pain through the madness (ayy, yeah)
Yeah, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic (ayy, yeah)
Yuh, yuh (okay)

[Verse 3: Keith Ape]
Back, saw them shrooms (shrooms)
Take me back to real me, ooh (ooh)
And I move my body into the boof, ooh (ooh)
And I spit truth—truth—, but to you a lie (lie)
I take off 'bout the line—line—, thinkin' 'bout the suicide (-cide)
Whippin', mixin' shit—ayy—on some different shit, ayy (ayy)
I don't know how we still alive and shit, ayy (yah)
Now I'm sick of saying, I 'on't give a shit, ayy (nah)
'Cause you know I really don't give a shit, ayy (nah)
I just wanna chill, ayy, so I poppin' feel, ayy
I can't feel this pills, ayy, still fighting with the fear, ayy
So I need that bills, right? (right)
So I need that trills, right? (right)
Pull us with this lean, right? (right)
Gotta get a hell, yuh (yuh)
Fuck reality (yuh)
In all reality (yuh)
Fuck society (yuh, fuck society)
'Cause I'm in anxiety, please don't try me (try me)
'Cause I'm that 악의 (악의)
나는 살인마처럼 창이 (yuh)

[Verse 4: Gold Gudda]
When I'm even sleepin', third eye always open
Y'all ain't really seein' faggy ninja, mine is closin'
Devil, let me keep in mind, guess I wasn't heavy
Talking to the reverend hoe, callin' on my line
I can't stand you bitches
I feel addicted, but it seems it the rare
I feel drowning in my dreams, is it rare?
My problem, you cannot understand it
Poppin' a pill like Muse, 하얀 눈은 겨울 아니라도 내림
You never know my feeling
Walking towards the villains, poppin' Xanny by the millions
It's RebelLife and Cohort, 우리는 미래, 전 세계 [?]야
Don't you ever fuckin' forget it

[Chorus: K.eYe.D]
Copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Ayy, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Ayy, copacetic acid, pain through the madness
Yeah, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Yuh, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Ayy, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Ayy, copacetic acid, pain through the madness
Yeah, copacetic acid, I've been passing magic
Yuh, yuh
