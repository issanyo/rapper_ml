[Intro: Keith Ape]
Squad shit!

[Hook: Keith Ape]
잊지 마
Underwater squad
여전히 몸엔 camo
Orca ninjas go rambo

[Verse 1: Da Garça]
Back in the thing where you need a controller
Back with a flame with that heat from Angola
Back with a ting with her back curving over from Spanish descent where she greet me like "Hola"
My God, my God, Hollup
What you know bout the mix huh?
Hunnid always in this huh?
94' girl and she come from the 6ixSide
Man that spell trouble
I swear in the zone I just might catch a bubble whenever she blow from a stick dipped in subtle transparent-like liquid like ish from a puddle
I swear to you now....
In the club oh you know what I could do
For the club oh you know what I could do
With the club I would hit it so hard like the way that only tiger wood do

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Jawn Othello]
Hmm, hey
Back in this bitch yo its jay
You gon have to just watch what you say
Cause you might catch these hands like you bout to go pray
Cause don't forget I'm from the streets
It G Ma to that me and my peeps
Have you yellowing all of your sheets
If it's beef, let's not turn this to Drizzy and Meek
Cause I come with that heat tho
Hotter than cheetos
Me and my Dawgs right outside of that peep hole
So salvage your goods, your money, your girl
Oh wait, shhh~ I might just get hit with that RICO
I'm just saying watch it, homie better stop it
You already caught it if we step up in a gauntlet
Wanna be a smart ass little Einstein well i don't wanna have to show ya ass to the rocket


Please pardon me, this you gotta see
This a lyrical lobotomy, and I oughta be
Aiming at anybody hot as me, no dichotomies
With no baby ass rappers looking like the Carter 3, ain't no axe be as broad as me
And obviously, the gift that God brought is me
But talk is cheap, so I had to jump to onyx league, cause ain't nobody hard as me, ain't no stopping me, honestly ah!

Was down so I had to re up
Too many clowns in the factory uh
Eat a pussy rapper just to get my green uh
Came with a bark all I heard was meows

You look like where my girl get wet
Need something to say then please don't hold your breath
Bon appitet, or bon appetite, I sat down at the feast that you'll never forget
