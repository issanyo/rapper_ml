[Intro: Manolo Rose]
Fame School
Hah, hah, hah, hah
Check the fucking laugh 'em [?]
Chop yo' ass down, boy

[Chorus: Manolo Rose]
Four titties, two pussies (two pussies)
Two bitches, one fool (one fool)
Two clips, one tool (one tool)
Chop 'em down, call that Gun Fu (Gun Fu)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Chop 'em down, call that Gun Fu (Gun Fu)

[Verse 1: Manolo Rose]
MAC 11 get to waving Kung Fu style (Kung)
Pull out on the scene and make a movie John Woo style
I see you in the spotlight and your ice show
In different color song, that's a light show
You stunting in the spot, doing the money dance
I'm tryna hold my Gs up, doing the gun dance
I got big faith in god, I get one chance
Gimme the loot, gimme the loot, I'm so Brookyln

[Chorus: Manolo Rose]
Four titties, two pussies
Two bitches, one fool (one fool)
Two clips, one tool (one tool)
Chop 'em down, call that Gun Fu (Gun Fu)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Chop 'em down, call that Gun Fu

[Verse 2: Manolo Rose]
In the bed, two women, nigga, one fool
You want to get like me, you gotta move different
You got to coach the bitch through it, give her pep talks
You got to make her feel proud to do the thot walk
I just left my hood, I'm still good there
Five feet something, but I'm feeling like I'm Suge there
Not that I couldn't but I wish a nigga would there
Put him in the pine box, nice suit and new pair

[Chorus: Manolo Rose & Keith Ape]
Four titties, two pussies
Two bitches, one fool (one fool)
Two clips, one tool (one tool)
Chop 'em down, call that Gun Fu (Gun Fu)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Chop 'em down, call that Gun Fu (ayy, ooh)

[Verse 3: Keith Ape]
My eyes fucking low like I'm Bruce Lee (pew, ooh)
And we cooling and we kicking like a Bruce Lee (pew, ah)
내가 누군지 모름 Complex magazine 봐 봐 (ayy)
Kids, open door, I'm the new Pusha T (ayy, nah)
Yark, New god flowing, god flowing (ooh)
Uh, this the god feeling, god feeling
Uh, 너흰 가지기, 가지기 힘든 힘을 갖고 있어
뒤지기 싫음 닥치길 (skrrr)
Who the fuck gon' stop us, Manolo got some choppers (pew)
너를 겨누지 (-지)
Kobe goof 'em, bitch (ooh)
네 집에 퍼붓지 (-지)
[?], shit
너넨 다 흰 띠 (띠)
우린 다 검은 띠 (ooh, pew)

[Chorus: Manolo Rose]
Four titties, two pussies
Two bitches, one fool (one fool)
Two clips, one tool (one tool)
Chop 'em down, call that Gun Fu (Gun Fu)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Fuck around if you want to (want to)
Chop 'em down, call that Gun Fu
