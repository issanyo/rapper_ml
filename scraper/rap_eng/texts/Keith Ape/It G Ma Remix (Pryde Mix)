(Richvale, real shit real shit)
In an Uber with the squad deep, all week, tell 'em we ain't lookin' for no trouble (Ouh!)
Doin' shows, shits packed in the rows, crowd lookin' like the fuckin' Royal Rumble (Ouh!)
Man I'm honest when your money movin' sonic, all these fuckboys wanna throw knuckles (Woo!)
But I'mma get money, er-everyday stuntin', tell 'em critics that I don't really give a fuck
Bitch I really look good, bitch I look good, bitch I look good
I've been hot since Good Wood, stylin' on these motherfuckers sayin' that they clean up nice
My whole crew look like a clothing line lookbook
Bitch that's fashion, duffle-bag paper walkin' out of every store like we don't cut the tag later
All I do is impress, screaming fuck my last haters, screaming fuck your whole crew
Your auntie, your dad, neighbors, your momma, your sister, your brother, fuck everybody you know
Got a middle finger hidden for everybody to show, white women at the crib, tell everybody it's snow
We just laugh at your like you just told everybody a joke
Motherfuckers really want a dish, so it's coming up, but I can really understand the life of a runner-up
All these number threes trynna be dissin' a number one, you can keep hating but I'm only here so I can double funds (Woo!)
Bitch I feel so alive, super drunk, stumblin' out, grab the wheel, I don't drive
Workin' like I'm dead broke, but money still on my mind
Young lords, last supper, chase a mil' for my guys
Murder everything in sight, we kill for the prize, still the same fucking dude when the millions arrive
Young Hank still the king of the hill on my side
Still breathing cause the real will survive
