Posted wet, uh (uh)

Boofin' lean, oh (oh)
Yeah, that's me, oh (yah)
Let me swim into the ocean (ayy, yah)

Bitches be like... (umm)
"Let me drink right" (umm)
"Let me sip right" (yah)
But I flip nice (nice)
'Cause I'm all about the money (yah)
'Cause I'm all about the hunnids (hunnids)

My gada never close (never close)
So I can't see where I'm goin' (where I'm goin')
Still believe in what I'm doin' (what I'm doin')
Different money, same circles
