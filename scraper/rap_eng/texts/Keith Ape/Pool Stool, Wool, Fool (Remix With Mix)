[Hook x2: Keith Ape (In English)]
Don't Forget (woo)
Underwater squad
I still got camo on my body
(Bape, Bape, Bape)
Orca ninjas go Rambo

[Verse 1: sviator1]
You think you're so cool
But you look like a stool fool wool pool
Sitting next to that spool
I'm ma dissect you like a bee
You don't look like me
With a...um....Shrek on a pirate ship...deck
Ooh burn
I look like a hamster
And you look like Mr. Ramster
Ooh burn
Like a stern
(That's a bird)
And you look like a turd
Ooh

[Hook x2: Keith Ape (In English)]
Don't Forget (woo)
Underwater squad
I still got camo on my body
(bape, bape, bape)
Orca ninjas go Rambo

[Verse 2: X&G]
(Try to stop us)x3
Try to stop us, right now
Living on all my power
Standing on top of my tower
Look at your face all sour
Twenty cents for two hours
Giving up so fast
You forgot your past
I was born to be a god
You were born to be queen
God, god, god, god
I'm a god, god, god...
X&G!
