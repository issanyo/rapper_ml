[Hook: Big Lurch] (x4)
Already boy, I'm from Texas boy
With a fat gat to droppin' niggas in seconds boy

[Verse 1: Big Lurch]
I'm from the land of tall buildings with hella gold teeth
And that means we talking that shit so that means there must be more beef
I hits the corner on a slab rolling on gold D's
Down every back street in Dallas ducking prejudice police
Because I'm strapped (already) on parole (already)
Walking and talking on gold (already)
Macking hoes on the avenue
I'm be having to disappear every once in a while when they blast at you
I laugh at you
If you miss because you bound to die
You fucking around with some niggas that's high off of formaldehyde
That zude the bang, sooths the brain before I do a hit (I'm already)
From the land of the wet cigarette

[Hook] (x4)

[Pre-Verse: Big Lurch] (x2)
Already boy, I'm hitting heavy like a Chevy (already)
Don't call over something real petty

[Verse 2: Big Lurch]
From the roads of yellow tape (already)
Bouncing from side to side in Cadillacs and '64 Chevy's
Already boy, money motivated getting fatty boy
Cause my papers been stacking like steady boy
I'm in this game heavy boy (already)
Quick to gut ya with the machete boy (already)
Rocking up cocaine and selling weed
The devilish mischievous child, the bad seed (I've already)
Been to juvenile and to the pin (I'm already)
That nigga that's having the Benjamins (already boy)
The joy of having major scrilla
The day that I'm broke I be that nigga that's turning into a killa (already)

[Hook] (x4)

[Verse 3: Lil Keke]
T-E-X-A-S
Dirty South back up to the West
These niggas don't wanna test
I stay strapped with a metal vest
I stay ready to ride ready to roll
Flippin' in my candy tart
H-town d-town got 'em screaming already boy
Young gun Lil Ke
Niggas don't wanna see me
Worldwide hard figure, radio, TV
Commission rich man
Big licks and rap fans
I make hits and tow shit
Do shows for 20 grand
The trend-setter go-getter
Tryna make my life better
Came up in this dirty game
Tryna get some mo cheddar
Ask that nigga Big Lurch
G's know thugs first
Rap stars new cars gotta hit 'em where it hurts
Its money man flipping things outta range it ain't gonna never change
I gets my chips and then I dip cuz I got hella fame
And you know we some G's getting money in the game nigga
Stress free

[Hook] (x6)

Already boy
