[Chorus]

Uh, that's all I hear
But there was no answer
So the outcome's probably gonna look real clear
Deep within a cell, a gangster
But now in his voice, I'm sensing fear
While ears scrutinized, mines will know when the death is near

You're not a gangster

[Verse 1]

Authority always strikes the first blow
But the average Joe, despite the criminal thought process created itself
But all I know
Is the system teaches us how the game go
And a well-raised little boy right into a heartless gangster by the time he's twenty-four
The best survivors when it comes to adapting to elements
Always end up looking like something that's less than heaven sent
In a juvenile hall
Life has no value at all
A gladiator school with dried up blood mixed with some food on the wall

You're not a gangster

Put your hands on enemies like roll it up, good riddance
And a real homeboy gets the [?]
So always be down to do some sticking
Yeah you can try to be the better man
Turn the other cheek and get stole on
Let it ride and get rolled on

You're not a gangster

Keep your mouth shut and get told on
Grab a Bible and believe that stuff about faith
If you just hold on
Or get with the gangster program and run a machine that can't do no wrong
Because now this is your home
And predators are on the prowl
So go roam

Bossman, Bossman

Better not scream it though holmes
He won't even push the alarm when you're getting banged on
But move in silence and he just might help ya
Get your slang on
But beware
The preservation's a muthafucker
Like a [?] is quick to bust ya

You're not a gangster

Bossman, Bossman

Don't scream in juvenile hall
You wanted to be like the gangster you saw in the movies
This begins it all
Can't be hard without the pain
Keep your focus, use your brain
Can't be mob without machine guns
The blueprints are doing things

You're not a gangster

[Chorus]

Bossman, Bossman, help me
Huh, that's all I hear
But there was no answer
So the outcome's starting to look real clear
Deep within a cell, a gangster
But now in his voice, I'm sensing fear
While ears scrutinize, mines are knowing that death is near

Bossman, Bossman, help me
Huh, that's all I hear
But there was no answer
So the outcome's starting to look real clear
Deep within a cell, a gangster
But now in his voice, I'm sensing fear
While ears scrutinize, mines are knowing that death is near

You're not a gangster

[Verse 2]

Profiles look like a whip that a D dealer gave to his homie
One's a known rider, the other one's a jaw-jacking phony
Tons a minister, Tony
Got the Shaheed blood where's your ponies
Nineteen seventies OG in Lueders park trying to hoop
I got a box of forties

You're not a gangster

Police don't like jaw-jackers
Set'em up and put'em up in a cell
With a [?]
So traumatized that he's living his life in hell
All I hear is fists pounding on flesh and shoes knocking on concrete
Can't tell who's winning, but whoever losing gots to be a goner

You're not a gangster

Bossman, Bossman, help me
Huh, that's all I hear
From the thud of the fists and shuffle of shoes, somebody ain't coming up outta there
Get hit forty-five times, normality
Walls covered in the blood of a casualty
Give it a couple of hours
From out of the towers
A riot [?]

You're not a gangster

With negative energy
Manifesting to an evil entity
Spirits that ain't on the premises is entering the body of your enemies
The guards ain't far
But watching you kill yourself is the law
Bossman, Bossman, help me
That's what I heard, that's what I saw

You're not a gangster

[Chorus]

Bossman, Bossman, help me
Huh, that's all I hear
But there was no answer
So the outcome's starting to look real clear
Deep within a cell, a gangster
But now in his voice, I'm sensing fear
While ears scrutinize, mines are knowing that death is near

You're not a gangster

Bossman, Bossman, help me
Huh, that's all I hear
But there was no answer
So the outcome's starting to look real clear
Deep within a cell, a gangster
But now in his voice, I'm sensing fear
While ears scrutinize, mines are knowing that death is near

You're not a gangster

Bossman, Bossman

Don't scream in juvenile hall
You wanted to be like the gangster you saw in the movie
This begins it all
Can't be hard without the pain
Keep your focus, use your brain
Can't be mob without machine guns
The blueprints are doing things

You're not a gangster
