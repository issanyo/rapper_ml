[Intro]

Lord, please forgive me for all of my sins
Lord please give me the strength to walk this troubled land
As a colored man
With my head high
And I know I can't go back to the past
But give me the confidence
Asleep and worry free
Along with all those who love me
And I got one question
I went through a lot of trials and tribulations that just weren't right
What's life?

Chorus:
What's life
Life is all of your trials and tribulations
Life is all of the evil that you be facing
Life is when you in incarceration
Stressed out, having memories
Wishing that you could erase em' (x2)

Verse one:
What's life
Messed up circumstances
This a predicament that I be facing
So I'm taking chances paper chasing
Collecting the dollars up all night
Like the moon [?] off some shrooms
If you my enemy
You get sniped down like Robert and John F Kenedy
With no remedy
I'm meant to be the rap entity, endlessly
Keeping the crowd bouncing off of some hennessy
To release my pain I'm going insane in the brain
Over past done thangs'
Wishing I could go back but I can't, I can't
So much pain, more pain
It seems as soon as I'm about to commit suicide, I regain my brain
I mean my sanity
So I continue confidentially pimping our hoe humanity, uh
Now days everything just ain't right
So I'm asking everybody what's life

Chorus:
What's life
Life is all of your trials and tribulations
Life is all of the evil that you be facing
Life is when you in incarceration
Stressed out, having memories
Wishing that you could erase em' (x2)

Verse two:
What's life
Life is trifling
I'm in the house bagging up a bag of weed and the po po's walk right in
Unlock doors with a warrant but I'm already slippin'
My girl told me last week to slow down but I kept trippin'
I just had to be the most [?] same dad I'm [?] up
Over excessive weed baggages
No traffic in and out of my house, I deliver packages
Now I'm in jail calling my girl
Begging her to marry me
But there's no answer, fuck that shit
Somebody snitched
Now I'm stressed out wishing I had a cancer stick
Incarcerated behind cement walls and bars
When I'm used to living like stars in luxurious cars
Now I'm confined to slavery
To much bad behavior in the act of bravery
Asking God will he be saving me
Every memory is a pain
Hoping that you consume my brain before I go insane
In this living hell but I'm asking what's life when your spending it in jail

Chorus:
What's life
Life is all of your trials and tribulations
Life is all of the evil that you be facing
Life is when you in incarceration
Stressed out, having memories
Wishing that you could erase em' (x2)

Verse three:
What's life
Life is a puzzle a maze
A deliberate road you could never finish walking in eternity
But the devil be turning me out or just a [?]
In court with the rest of guys, children for higher learning, g
But purposely, never released on parole
But touched down 5.0 on gold sitting on swole
Back to my old way of living, slightly [?]
Just the other day my girl was [?] the butcher knife, like I
[?]
Tryna' get my stuff back tied

Chorus:
What's life
Life is all of your trials and tribulations
Life is all of the evil that you be facing
Life is when you in incarceration
Stressed out, having memories
Wishing that you could erase em' (x2)

What's life (x4)
