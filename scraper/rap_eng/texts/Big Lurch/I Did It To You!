[Intro]
You know I just killed this song fool
Yeah that nigga dead fool
Nothing but your murder nigga, uh yeah uh

[Hook]
Jason Vorhees, Michael Myers and Freddy Krueger, Jeffrey Dahmer, Charles Manson
And all of your friends I'm finsta school ya
'Cuz murder's a hobby
I'm using a torture chamber and not a Ruger
So if you wake up in a puddle of blood nigga I did it to you (x2)

[Verse 1]
There's a million ways to die, a million ways to kill
So I'mma set an example out of a mothafucka without my steel
'Cuz I'm like a hungry lion I moves in for the slaughter
Killing for the simplest things, twenty dollar bills and even quarters
I'm like a vampire, nigga, fresh meat, I can't pass it
Walking down the street with a syringe, injecting fools with battery acid
Leaving your mama singing the blues, nigga I'm bad news
I watch you sink to the bottom of the ocean wearing cement shoes
When I was born the doctor twisted up the facts
He said that I was a devil's son so now I'm having flashbacks
The preacher almost drown-ded me at baptism
So on the sixth year anniversary of my birth, I had to get him
So call the coroner 'cuz Lucky Lurch just warming up
Dead bodies and still decapitating niggas with maggots swarming 'em
'Cuz murder's a hobby, I'm using torture chambers and not a Ruger
So if you wake up in a puddle of blood nigga I did it you. (x2)

[Hook - x2]

[Verse 2]
Late in the afternoon the mailman was delivering
So I threw him in my house, slit his throat and left him shivering
Just because my social security check came too late
And I wasn't gonna make it to the bank, so he had to meet his death date
One day I'm kicking it with the homies and the neighbors got mad at us
So I threw him in my basement to kick it with my baby snakes and rattlers
They should not have told that me that the ATF was gon' rage
Just because we in the backyard blowing up dynamite sticks and grenades
I called the Domino's pizza man while watching a football game
And it made mad after he didn't show up when thirty minutes came
So when the doorbell rang I fucked him up like a mobster
While my baby mama still complaining that she got fingers up in her pasta
I went to the speaker shop to get 18s for my truck
But when I got in my ride I didn't like the way that they hooked 'em up (uh)
Because the amp would turn off whenever it wasn't cold
He got in my truck to fix it, I turned up the beat and watched his ears explode
So call the coroner 'cuz Lucky Lurch just warming up
Dead bodies and still decapitating niggas with maggots swarming 'em (uh)
'Cuz murder's a hobby, I'm using a torture chamber and not a Ruger
So if you wake up in a puddle of blood nigga I did it to you

[Hook - x2]

[Verse 3]
I'll make you play tug of war with barb wire
Then pour salt on your wounds and gas on your clothes and start a fire
Let it burn for two minutes and put it out
Take the pus out your wounds and put that shit up in your mouth
I don't give a fuck about my enemies nigga, I done lost it
I'll stick your hands in a freezer until them mothafuckas is frosted
And then I'll turn on the heater and watch 'em thaw
While you agonizing in pain, I'll simply break yo jaw
So call the coroner 'cuz Lucky Lurch just warming up
Dead bodies and still decapitating niggas with maggots swarming 'em
'Cuz murder's a hobby, I'm using a torture chamber and not a Ruger
So if you wake up in a puddle of blood nigga, I did it you

[Pause]

[Outro]
Murder, kill kill kill kill, murder murder murder murder, kill kill kill
'Cuz murder's a hobby I'm using a torture chamber and not a Ruger
So if you wake up in a puddle of blood nigga, I did it to you

[Hook]
