Verse 1:
I ain't worried about the future
I get mine, it's my time, they doin' what I used ta
Ain't no life like my life, ain't fucking with these moochers
I sip wine, look so fine, walk around in my Gucci's
Cuz when I'm on one, I light one, ya know
I got this money on my mind
If you love it hit rewind
If you doesn't hit recline
Serve these bitches, dinnertime

Hook:
I'ts like a holiday, day, day, day
Spending all my cash like a holiday, day, day, day
With my fam, getting trashed like a holiday, day, day, day
In the yacht overseas like a holiday, day, day, day
Lighting up them trees, like a holiday

Verse 2:
Stay fresher than some Dentyne
Drink lean in the Bent, that's what I call a Bentley
And I don't give a fuck like I was still a pre-teen
New Range Rover truck when I'm skiing in Aspen
Everyday like New Year's Eve
We don't play like scratched CDs
Smokin' J's out in Paris
Ain't no way you goin' see me
Sippin' drinks up in past Nice[?]
Money long like old Cadi's
Always high like a trapeze
Like, what, Keanu Reeves
I'm on my beat boy shit, now I'm cast in this bitch
Never ever been rich, Cash Money is the click
Now shit done flip my whip been pin-ed
On this click, that Dorothy shit
Drink gin and juice like mine's Uncle Snoop[?]
Flavor 3 coupes cuz I spit the truth[?]
On top of boost put drinks on loops
Fuck the world, hundred proof

Hook:
I'ts like a holiday, day, day, day
Spending all my cash like a holiday, day, day, day
With my fam, getting trashed like a holiday, day, day, day
In the yacht overseas like a holiday, day, day, day
Lighting up them trees, like a holiday

Verse 3:
Now we don't love them motherfucka's
Who be talkin' that shit, actin' like they all above us
I stay drinking that shit, Ace of Spades in my cupboards
I got money in the bank, timeshare in the Bahamas
Wanna get with this chick, beat it up like a drummer
Like the fi-ner things, Saint-Tropez in the summer
I can buy those things, see it all on my Tumblr
Like a clogged up drain, can't stop me as I come up

Hook:
I'ts like a holiday, day, day, day
Spending all my cash like a holiday, day, day, day
With my fam, getting trashed like a holiday, day, day, day
In the yacht overseas like a holiday, day, day, day
Lighting up them trees, like a holiday
