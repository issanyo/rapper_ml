[Hook]
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic

[Verse 1]
I, I, I got the vodka and soda
Hold it up high like a Rocket Minnesota
Outside, coppers and Rovers
I don't give a fuck, drop top, I'm tryna see Hova
My song's gonna be all over
B-B-Bitches it's a wrap, that's a beat all over
You dead wrong if you sober
Hoes stay back, show grace like Topher
So tonight we gon' get a case of ace of spades
Spray lames in the fucking face
And tonight we might catch a case
Get laced like we just won the fucking race
So if you ride like we ride and tonight be the night
Got you going in heaven (heaven)
Grab a dime or a nine, have the time of your life
Lids flowing, no livin' (livn')

[Hook]
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic (oh, oh)
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic (put your hands up)
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic

[Verse 2]
My attitude is fuck it, motherfuckers gon' love it
Like 'Pac was still alive, west coast, they love it
I never gave a shit like Britney Spears in public
G-Gon' be on top like we about to reach the summit
My fans know the words, why yours be humming?
My man buy me loubs, why yours be bumming?
Got twice as many pairs as you, I'm doubling
Get twice as many stares like Gazelle make you run it
(I'm gonna twerk), (I'm gonna twerk)
I'm gonna twerk, I'm getting lit
(Gonna work, work, work, work)
I'm gonna work, stay getting it
(Jerk, jerk, jerk)
You a jerk, get your own licks
(Lurk, lurk, lurk)
You a lurk, check your own pics
Ain't got a care in the world
Middle finger up (finger up)
Skater girl
Sippin' liquor up (liquor up)
Faded girl
Hitting better Bud
Later girl

[Hook]
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic (put your drinks up)
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic

[Bridge]
Liquor, liquor, liquor, liquor
P-P-P-Pour it in my cup, hold it up, way up
Liquor, liquor, liquor, liquor
Let me see you get drunk, let me see you man up
Liquor, liquor, liquor, liquor
Toast to tonight, DJ got us on a high
Liquor, liquor, liquor, liquor
Some wanna fight, I just wanna get right

[Hook]
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
And I can't even call it
Every time I drink, I drink like an alcoholic
