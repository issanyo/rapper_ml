[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
Boy, you are lucky I even tried some shit with you
Put in time, held you down and I always got lit with you
You the reason why a guy's get a bad rep
You the only thing I live to regret
Man, I should've known you, try to side step
Full of fucking lies, those secrets you kept
I ain't got time for it
Bitch, I moved on and I'm happy you gone
Put my life on it
Truth came out, no shadow of a doubt
You a lame for it
But now you gonna learn, don't get another turn
You late on it
Yeah yeah, you late on it

[Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
I already got a new bae
I already got a new bae
Motherfucker, you too late
'Cause I already got a new bae
New, new-new, new bae

[Post-Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
You say that you're sorry
But I can't believe that you treat me this way
You tryna come back in my life
But you already know it's too late
'Cause I got a new bae
I already got a new bae
New bae, new bae

[Verse 2: Safaree]
Listen, old bae, I'm tired of you, I don't see the fire in you (nah)
You washed, I'ma put the dryer to you (hah)
You're a geek, I see the quagmire in you (whoa)
I'm the boss and ain't nobody hiring you (strip!)
I got a new bae that give it to me when a nigga want it
Pretty ass and face and lips, and no, no she ain't scared to flaunt it
All that make-up she was wearing got a nigga feeling horny
Rather be alone than be with someone still not feeling wanted
Chanel, just tell me what that girl was thinking?
Was she sober? Tell me was she sipping?
Old bae mad at new bae
Guess that dick really got her tripping
Stuntman, Chanel West Coast dipping

[Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
I already got a new bae
I already got a new bae
Motherfucker, you too late
'Cause I already got a new bae
New, new-new, new bae

[Post-Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
You say that you're sorry
But I can't believe that you treat me this way
You tryna come back in my life
But you already know it's too late
'Cause I got a new bae
I already got a new bae
New bae, new bae
