[Hook: Chanel]
If you see us in the streets lay us down cause you wanna come fuck with us
Y’all clown ass bitches be snitching round here, we ready to bust
We rolling back into the night, the night
We everywhere, we everywhere, yeah we ain’t going nowhere

[Verse 1: Frenchie]
Since a little dude, had the juice running through my veins
Got me feeling like Pac
Like a stop sign posted on your block, I’m about mine
Imma get guap
I pull up in that all black
Cruising my city, hit the button top fall back
Black phantom, black tints
Yellow [?], [?] rims
You don’t got to like me but your chick know me
Puff Daddy in the city, I’m the big homie
When you see us in the club, 50 bottles with sparkles, bring em to us
Everybody in your section want to come over here, y’all ain’t fucking with us
Wait, hold up, freeze
Your pockets immature, your money need to grow up, please
You don’t really know my speed
200 on the dash, you’ll know when I leave (Skkrr!)

[Verse 2: B.o.B]
We ain’t going, but your girl at my crib tiptoeing
The bandmobile only move for the coin
The bandmobile only move for the coin, foreign
I’m an employer, I ain’t got no time to loiter
Got a Glock in every drawer, blame it on my paranoia
Smoking through the quarters like I’m tryna meet a porter
Get your lady off my sofa ‘fore I hit her with the cobra
With [?], [?] on a diet, ladies raise your hand if you got low mileage
I got a dope hybrid, your pack is so quiet
I ain’t going nowhere bitch, unless I’m going diamond
Bands

[Verse 3: Frenchie]
I got your girl running hard, 100 lines
Got two girls off of insta, double time
Now from a real nigga to a real nigga
I’m on now, so I don’t got to deal with ya
But Imma keep it real with ya
Take a couple million just for me feel with ya
I ain’t going nowhere no time soon
Hear them hustlers in the car when the car move
Wait, hold up, please
I be everywhere, you don’t ever show up, please
Next stop, overseas
Counting new money, I call it that Euro cheese
