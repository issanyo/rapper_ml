You can say what you want
You can think what you think
Assumin' you know [?]
But you don't know me
I bet all that shit caused so many tears
But I still can hold and I have no fears
The world's step ahead and I'm not fully prepared
I place any bet, I take any dare
Cause nothin' in this world can make me scared
I felt so much hurt, it's time to dedicate
I knew it was worth,it's time to climb stairs
Still here climbin' in my way to the top
Everyday climbing, never gonna stop
Focus on a dream that should've come true
Nobody can defeat me, I'm speaking the truth
Nobody completes me, all I need is [?]
All I need is a highway and then I live cool
Cause music is my true love, music's what I do

[Hook:]
My heart is full of passion and my eyes are seeing a vision
So keep in this profession
Cause I'm on a mission
My heart is full of passion and my eyes are seeing a vision
So keep in this profession
Cause I'm on a mission
Cause I'm on a mission
Cause I'm on a mission
Cause I'm on a mission
Cause I'm on a mission

I woke up today, I was so much fresh
It's gonna be okay
I'm heading to success
Through so much pain, blood and sweat
Seems like yesterday I lost my best friends
It was also suddenly, never had a warning
Path made of mud but I'm still your warning
Haters have to be here in my ride to the top and for no apparent reason they were brutally shocked
After bleed to death
I am on the sidewalk
It takes it all my breath
Even around the clock
But time can't stop
They can't beat him
You can only move if I stay to sing
And your heart have all
Everyday keep breath
Even if you let go
Your memories keep insane
Keep a minutes in your place
And nobody can take it
No matter what you say
They know that you made it

[Hook]

I'm on a mission now
Nothin' can hold me back
Through all the ups and downs
I'm on the right track
I'm focus on my dreams
No matter what I go through
I will complete my mission
Cause I know I'm supposed to
I got ambition in me
It's time for me to use it
I know I got the talent
It's time for me to prove it
So I'mma speed my mind
With the wrong or the right
Cause music is my mission
This mission is my life (life, life, life)
Cause music is my mission, this mission is my life
(this mission is my life, this mission is my life, this mission is my life)
Cause music is my mission, this mission is my life
(this mission is my life, this mission is my life)
