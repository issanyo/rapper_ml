[Chorus:]
I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it
I made it

I used to dream about
The life I'm livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it
I made it

They see me on the tv now I'm semi-famous
A lot of Mother fuckers know what my name is
Big thanks to my homie Rob Dyrdek
Cause of him now
Chanel is here yes

But don't get it twisted cause even without him
I still be the illest chick, yep, I still be bout it
Fuck the fame, Fuck the tv I want my voice heard loudest
I'm the rap queen go ahead and doubt it

[Chorus:]
I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it
I made it

I used to dream about
The life I'm livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it
I made it

I gotta speak louder cause they can't hear me
Yes I'm white like powder but a hood chick clearly
Growin pounds yearly I stay pushin weight
I'm a real G these other bitches just fake

Yes I'm a sweet girl, and I look innocent
But I'm down for my shit you know what the buisness is
Any bitch wanna talk to me say it to my face
Cause I get high quick when it rains, I don't hesitate
Bout to set the record straight
CC the real deal Barbie I look like a playmate
These other bitches hardly ready for what I'm a say
Go ahead hate on me you motivate me everyday

[Chorus:]
I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it
I made it

I used to dream about
The life I'm livin' now
I known that there's no doubt I made it
I made it
I made it

I Made it
I Made it
I, I, I Made it
I'm real hip hop
Fuck miss Tik Tok
I'm a valley girl bitch I'll kick your ass in flip flops
Blah blah blah where is your vocabulary
Ha ha ha L.A. is my territory

Where these ho's come from actin like they run my town
I don't like to run my mouth
But it's time to get 'em out

Get up out my way
I'm about to take over
You already lost the game
Game Over

I'm done with dissin'
We already know what's up
I squash the competition like I squash a bug
These no talent hoes they are all out dated
I got the baddest flow man I already made it
[Chorus:]
I look up to the sky
And now the world is mine
I've known it all my life
I made it
I made it

I used to dream about
The life I'm livin' now
I know that there's no doubt
I made it
I made it

I made it
I made it
I made it
I, I, I made it
