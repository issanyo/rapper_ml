[Intro]
Me and you, you and me
Can you put your ass up in the sheets?
Up and down, spinnin' now
My bitch coming up to take you down
I be going hard 'til the sun come up, ayy
Don't be blaming liquor if your shit just don't stay up, ayy
Heels on, clothes off, why you still in there? Take your jacket off
Take a hit, do the shit, make sure you hold it in 'til you feeling it
G-Go on and take it off, baby, drop 'em the floor, ayy
What you workin' with, I hope that you an animal, ayy

[Chorus]
We-We-We-We can do anything that you really wanna do
What's on your mind? Let's get it on
W-What you wanna do, boy? Clear it off
We-We-We-We can do anything that you really wanna do
What's on your mind? Let's get it on
W-What you wanna do, boy? Clear it off
You ain't gotta worry, you ain't gotta worry
Ain't nobody comin', baby
You ain't gotta worry
I-I-I get this spot, if you hit this spot
You ain't gotta worry, you ain't gotta worry

[Verse 2]
Round two, me and you, straddlin' the horsey, I'm riding you
Glad you came to do your thing, shit so big gotta put your claim
See it on your face, boy, you better not tap out, ayy
Don't be letting go, show me what you braggin' 'bout, ayy
All night, the neighbors coming, ears on the door, tryna hear somethin'
Radio loud as hell, face in the pillow, boy you wide as hell
You say you the boss, I can see just what you mean, yea
Rude boy got some sting to him, you my sex machine, yea

[Chorus]
We-We-We-We can do anything that you really wanna do
What's on your mind? Let's get it on
W-What you wanna do, boy? Clear it off
We-We-We-We can do anything that you really wanna do
What's on your mind? Let's get it on
W-What you wanna do, boy? Clear it off
You ain't gotta worry, you ain't gotta worry
Ain't nobody comin', baby
You ain't gotta worry
I-I-I get this spot, if you hit this spot
You ain't gotta worry, you ain't gotta worry

[Verse 3]
It begins, then lick a lot (a lot)
We gonna set it off tonight
Like a pair of astronauts, we gonna take off and fly
If you wanna put it on me, show me that you is my only
And you genuine, like pony, so that we can be like Tony
Can only imagine the way you be smashin'
Got me insane, cashin' passion
And I thought we agreed like bogus passion
I love when you grasp it, grasp it
My body gonna sit the way you handle it, make me feel so safe
And I gotta get a grip cuz you takin' it, it's some, gimme, gimme shit

[Chorus]
We-We-We-We can do anything that you really wanna do
What's on your mind? Let's get it on
W-What you wanna do, boy? Clear it off
We-We-We-We can do anything that you really wanna do
What's on your mind? Let's get it on
W-What you wanna do, boy? Clear it off
You ain't gotta worry, you ain't gotta worry
Ain't nobody comin', baby
You ain't gotta worry
I-I-I get this spot, if you hit this spot
You ain't gotta worry, you ain't gotta worry
