He was on my heels
Sitting as I stepped in the place
He said he just wanted to dance
Lust written on his face
Just cause I'm up done on you for one song
It don't mean your gonna take me home
But if you send me a drink I'm a take it
And if I feel like moving I'm a shake it
It may appear that I like ya
Cause I flirt a little bit
But trust me I don't want ya
And I don't know your shit

You can spend your whole money trying trying to get me
Trying to get me trying trying to get me
I don't gaurentee that your leaving with me
I'm a tease boy so take it easy boy
I'm a tease I'm a tease and this is your warning
W-w-warning
I left my phone in the car
I don't wanna exchange numbers
I'm trying to be under your owner (idk)
Let it close with the girls taking pictures
Flic flick flick I know I look good
Flick flick flick flick and wish you could

But if you send me a drink I'm a take it
And if I feel like moving I'm a shake it
It may appear that I like ya
Cause I flirt a little bit
But trust me I don't want ya
And I don't know your shit

You can spend your whole money trying trying to get me
Trying to get me trying trying to get me
I don't gaurentee that your leaving with me
I'm a tease boy so take it easy boy
I'm a tease I'm a tease and this is your warning [x2]

You think I'm leavin with you what I look like to you
I ain't a little ho about to leave my whole crew
I'm here to party drop it low to the floor
I look like a barbie but I'm not a bimbo
You just met me no you can't get the digits
So keep it stepping move with the quickness
I don't care you a balla got me all wrist freeze
So dope trying to holla baby boy on me

You can spend your whole money trying trying to get me
Trying to get me trying trying to get me
I don't gaurentee that your leaving with me
I'm a tease boy so take it easy boy
I'm a tease I'm a tease and this is your warning [x2]
