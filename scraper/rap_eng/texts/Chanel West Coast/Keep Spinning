[Verse 1]
People walking like they
Think they important I'm not
Supporting they showing they
True colors when they talking I'm aborting
It's exhausting that I'm caught in the moment
When rappers flowin
Like other rappers in every song sound the fucking same
People think they know me
From shows on they TV
My flows they don't, believe me
Some hoes they want to be me
Some hoes they tryin to see me push buttons like it was serious
Stop fronting I'm bout my
Keeweed the screens for all your lanes
Caught up in a jungle
The world, the way we struggle
The world, the way we juggle
Sometimes we need to huddle
Sometimes we need to cuddle
My rhymes that be my hustle
Bout brands like I was rustle
The start of my campaign

[Hook]
This world keep on spinnin
This world keep on spinnin
This world keep on spinnin
Round and round we go (x2)

[Verse 2]
Shoot me for the stars like
A fucking paparazzi can't wait to learn
Lennon's for the local vavazachi
Driving fancy cars they still see me
At the swap meet pullin up wit jaws
With that sticky icky bomb weat
(bomb weat)
And I gotta do what I gotta
Gamble on myself navada
Stappin for the wealth I wanna
I'm moving so stale poronna
I got all these dudes double taking
Like a two for one in the cali sun they baking
All these fucking rules I'm a load the guns they breaking
I'll never lose and I'll never lose I'm waiting

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Some people wanna talk about ya
Some people wanna try and doubt
Ya I got myself here with out ya
And the world keeps on spinnin
Nothing but love all around me and all the hate that's
Trying to surround me nothing will ever stop me
And the world keeps on spinnin
And the world keeps on spinnin
(world keeps spinnin)

[Hook]
