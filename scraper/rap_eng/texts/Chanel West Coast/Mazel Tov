[Intro]
Mazel tov, mazel tov, mazel tov
M-M-M-Mazel tov
Spend it, spend it, spend it all
Spend it, spend it, spend it all
Spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it
M-M-Mazel tov

[Verse 1]
D-D-Don't get-Don't-Don't-Don't get-Dont get mad at me
Molotov cocktail when I bomb a beat
West Coast Chanel, got love for the east
Livin' life fairy tale beauty and a beast
Yo' records don't sell 'cause you're doing the least
My records won't fail so call me the police
I'm reckless, oh well, kill 'em all, rest in peace
Got 'em overdose (overdose, ahh-ah)
Talk a good game but don't live a white lie
Not here for the fame 'bout my business, G5
Out of your range, can't see me, satellite
And you ain't never know such original
Your flow is as pitiful, your fans is doin' the most
Take a shot, criminal (criminal, criminal)
And you ain't even seen nothin'
Me and my team mean, out here stuntin'

[Chorus]
Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
M-M-Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
M-M-Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
M-M-Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
Spend it, spend it, spend it all
Spend it, spend it, spend it all
Spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it
M-M-Mazel tov

[Verse 2]
Champagne by the case loads, case closed
Playin' Jay Z, change flows while I change clothes
Maintain hoes, thought you came close
But you ain't know me bro  you a extra, lay low (lay low)
Keep the gate closed, in my bed, never stay home
Two Bentleys and a charcoal gray roll
Got it made, chefs and maids on the payroll (payroll, payroll)
(Laa-La)
Your car mellow when my car fly
Diamonds yellow like stars in the sky
I pop bottles while you serve fries
And you ain't never shown such initiative
Cave man, you primitive, game plan is livin' big
You can't stand I'm livin' it (I'm livin' it, I'm livin' it)
And we goin' always stay bumpin'
Start it up like I push one button (push one button)

[Chorus]
Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
M-M-Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
M-M-Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
M-M-Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
Spend it, spend it, spend it all
Spend it, spend it, spend it all
Spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it
M-M-Mazel tov

[Verse 3]
New concert's up like it's summertime
Sippin' white wine on the beach, I'm another high
Then I made the cut like a samurai
Wonder why I say what I want no matter why
From Darby to the Beverly
We shakin' ass, spendin' cash, hut Beverley
Pardon me but, I'll forever be
A bad ass with class, Jacky Kennedy
Hah-hah, laughin' all the way to the bank, cuz I
Never took a break, stayed on my grind
Now you know my name is stayin' on your mind
And tonight we gon' show, we killin' it, all else irrelevant
Top shelf, we hella best, success, they smellin' it (smellin' it)
And if you want it bitch, show somethin'
If they ain't suckin' dick, quit fuckin'

[Chorus]
Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
M-M-Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
M-M-Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
M-M-Mazel, mazel, mazel tov
Spend it, spend it, spend it all
Spend it, spend it, spend it all
Spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it, spend it
M-M-Mazel tov
