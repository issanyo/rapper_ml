I'm looking at the stars
Lost in the sky
I'm looking at the stars but I see no light
I don't know why
I feel it in my heart
It's my time to fly
I feel it in my heart
There's no more tears left to cry

[Hook]
It's like I'm stuck in quicksand
Life keeps pulling me down, down
And I just need your hand
To come and pull me out, out, out
It's like I'm stuck in quicksand, quicksand
Keep pulling me down (2x)
I just need your hand (2x)
To come and pull me out, come and pull me out

I'm sitting here thinking about all the mistakes I made
All the risks I had to take
I can't stop thinking
It won't fade away
No matter how much I'm drinking

[Hook]

[Outro]
Your hand
I just need your hand
To come and pull me out
Come and pull me out
