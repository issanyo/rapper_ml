[Hook]
I don't give a fuck, I never did
I'm the baddest bitch, chillin in the hills
You talking broke? I'm talking bills
I dress to kill

[Verse 1: Chanel]

It's your girl Chanel
West coast queen
Bitch want to test me? go ahead please
Crush you hoes like a soda can
I got the baddest flows it's over man
I'll slap a ho
Even with my spray tan
White girl swag get the fuck outta my way man
I don't give a fuck
I'm so ruthless
Causing a ruckus
I'm a fucking nuisance
Bitches hating, even my own friends
Fuck that fake shit, I don't need no friends
I do me, don't care what you think
I get money, stack paper like kinko's
Flow so sick, spit a verse before you blink, yo
Twisted shit, but I can slow it down real slow
Turtle flow, Smoking purple dro
Don't worry ho, go hurry home
It's about to get cold, 'bout to get ugly
I ain't no friendly ho
Don't try to hug me
Little baby thug, see? lookin' fly
Looking lovely, little Cali dime
I ain't even gotta try
Swag in my bloodstream
24/7 high, Kush what I'm puffin
It ain't nothin, I stay stuntin'
None of you bitches could touch me

[Hook]
I don't give a fuck, I never did
I'm the baddest bitch, chillin in the hills
You talking broke? I'm talking bills
I dress to kill

[Verse: 2]

I'm a fucking bitch, bad attitude
Hoes in my bizz that's why I act rude
I don't give a fuck no nice guy
Wanna push your luck? go ahead and try
Bad temper and my pussy got a sign on it
Don't enter less a dude spend time on it
Put a rock on my finger I'm a bad bitch
Crispy like a chicken finger and I'm mad rich
Rocking Gucci, Fendi, Louis, Prada some bitches hate it
Got alot of brand names, guess I'm basic
I don't give a fuck though
I be out here getting dough
Plus I gotta better flow
Icy in a sweater yo
Yes I'm the general
Flow is incredible
Sweet like candy
Yeah I'm so edible
Flyer than a parachute
Nails did, hair is cute
Got too many pair of shoes
Louis V, Jimmy Choo
Alot people steady dissing
But I eat the competition
Eat em up in my kitchen
Homie I suggest you listen
Yeah you know I'm on a mission
Sitting wit my palms itching
That means money I'mma get it
One day I'mma be the richest
You can't even understand it
Cause you don't even live it
Focus on my business
Chilling smoking on a swisher
Man fuck these bitches
