Verse 1:
Pouring liquor like a faucet
I’m tighter than a corset
Yea, I am on my boss shit
So hot they call me roastest
So hot they call me toastest
So gone they call me ghostest
So far that I am gone still ahead of all you most and
Why you still hopin’ fo’ kids
I be in Cabo smokin’
That shit Gustavo holdin’
With models that be cokein’
Go big that is my slogan
This bitch is still here flowing
Live big and I’m still growing
Against why you still ho’in
I got this…no contest
Bout to come up in this bitch, prom dress
Paid my dues, comin’ up, confess
Now my crew comin’ up, God bless
Balmain, Givenchy
I ball man, stay raunchy
Shout out to Mack Maine and Tunechi
Make my money with my brain not my coochie

Hook:
Bigger than, bigger, bigger than
You never see nuttin’ like this again, this again (x4)

Verse 2:
Don’t approach me, your shirt too tight
You must be makin’ lefts, you ain’t lookin’ right
You ain’t makin’ sense, your mouth to dry
Have your homie drive you home, keep it movin’, bye
Good morning world, rise and shine
Put my heart up in this shit, Valentine
Imma tiger in this bitch, Life of Pi
Make a livin’ off my spit, no more 9 to5
Drop it low, shake that ass
Smokin’ dro, I’m living fast
Let ‘em know, no need to ask
Better study ho, you late to class
These bitches cut and I’m a sutcher
These bitches fucked, kama sutra
Keep your boyfriend’s tucked, six shooter
They stuck in a rut and I’m the future

Hook:
Bigger than, bigger, bigger than
You never see nuttin’ like this again, this again (x4)

Yea
Mmmm…uh huh

Verse 3:
I’m walking on sunshine, sippin’ white wine
On cloud 9 winning, it’s my time
Par like I pack 9 bars like a life of crime
On lock, it’s party time, I’m about gettin’ mine

Hook:
Bigger than, bigger, bigger than
You never see nuttin’ like this again, this again (x2)
