Need a man to light it up in the back of the Jeep

I'm coppin' Loubi's in Paris, speedin' off in a race
Smokin' doubies with Frankie, gettin' out of our face
Say he knew me, got at me, but he can't have a taste
Sippin' D’usse and Louis, tres, tres, tres

Make records for the Jeeps like it's '98
Ain't lookin' for no beef, but you chicks is lame
Trynna be a boss bitch like Beyoncé, motherfucker
