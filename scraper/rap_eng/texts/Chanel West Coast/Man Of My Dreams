It's your girl Chanel
This is for everbody that's in love

I wake up in the morning and I see your face
Ain't no other guy that can take your place
Your the one for me and I know that now
For awhile I was lost but now I'm found
I think about you all the time I can't even sleep
And when I close my eyes I see you in my dreams
I love your beautiful lips and your beautiful eyes
Ever since our first kiss I was hypnotized

Baby let's take a ride your the one for me
I need you by my side your the man of my dreams
Baby let's take a ride your the one for me
I need you by my side your the man of my dreams

Please don't ever leave me your the perfect guy
At first I didn't see it but now I know why
My eyes were closed I was livin blind
But you changed my life your one of a kind
You treat me like a queen and you make me laugh
You don't care I'm on tv you love who I am
You were there when I was broke even when I was chubby
Back when I was nobody I knew that you loved me
Your the realest man that I ever met
I'm your biggest fan baby your the best
Nothing that you do could make me mad
You make me so happy never make me sad
You always keep it real and you never lie
You ain't a little kid you know you got a dime
You don't care about them G's you got me now
Baby I'm here to please you I'm a hold you down

Baby let's take a ride your the one for me
I need you by my side your the man of my dreams
Baby let's take a ride your the one for me
I need you by my side your the man of my dreams

Since you came around my life ain't been the same
I'm thinkin for the first time of changin' my name
It's hard to see you everyday know deep in side
That you might not feel the same about me in your mind
So tell me how you feel let me know if it's true
That your in love with me like I'm in love with you
Can't get enough of you I don't need to test you
I now I can trust you I would never stress you
Don't know where id be if I never met you
It's hard for me to see livin life without you
It's hard to imagin if I never found you
I feel so much passion everytime I'm around you
I love everything about you, baby I could never doubt you
You give me no reason to
Cause every single thing that you do is unbelievable
I can't believe that it's true

Baby let's take a ride your the one for me
I need you by my side your the man of my dreams
Baby let's take a ride your the one for me
I need you by my side your the man of my dreams
