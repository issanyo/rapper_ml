[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
Got 'em on nitrous like Nos
I blow tighter than Botox
The one [?] clothing
Can't be paint like a blow [?]
On my grind like a skater
Stop your run like a taser
In the cut like a razor
Nothin' minor I'm major
Slippin' out the white Lamborghini
Zap them like I lost my bikini
Paparazzi flash, wanna see me
I'm here like a dream [?]
In the buildin' like an elevator
I'm high, stay baked, potato
We the illest, need a respirator
Do you work it good? I work it greater

[Pre-Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
Slice it, dice it
Can I have a piece? I like it
Spike it, light it
Take a little dip and fly quick
Slice it, dice it
Can I have a piece? I like it
Can I have a piece? I like it
I like it

[Chorus: Liam Horne]
Girl, let the money fall
Let it fall to the floor, yeah
They wanna see you take it all, so take it all
Got them beggin' you for more, they say
Ay-ay-ay-ah, ay-ay-ay-ah
Ay-ay-ay-ah, ay-ay-ay-ah
(Girl, get that money)
Ay-ay-ay-ah, ay-ay-ay-ah
Ay-ay-ay-ah, ay-ay-ay-ah
(Girl, get that money)

[Verse 2: Chanel West Coast]
Flow so cold, E-Eskimo
Baddest bitch [?] show
I been never ever know [?]
[?]
See them see that's me
Up in the V.I.P
Ace of spades, one French braid
Money self-made, that's who I be
Yup, Louboutins on my feet
So, move along if you week
If money turn you on, shake ya ass to the song
[?] all night long, Rich Skillz on the beat
Yea, lames can't compete
Y'all bungin' no names, don't leap
I'ma get a money campaign, never stop fast lane
West Coast's the last name, out my way

[Pre-Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
Slice it, dice it
Can I have a piece? I like it
Spike it, light it
Take a little dip and fly quick
Slice it, dice it
Can I have a piece? I like it
Can I have a piece? I like it
I like it

[Chorus: Liam Horne]
Girl, let the money fall
Let it fall to the floor, yeah
They wanna see you take it all, so take it all
Got them beggin' you for more, they say
Ay-ay-ay-ah, ay-ay-ay-ah
Ay-ay-ay-ah, ay-ay-ay-ah
(Girl, get that money)
Ay-ay-ay-ah, ay-ay-ay-ah
Ay-ay-ay-ah, ay-ay-ay-ah
(Girl, get that money)
