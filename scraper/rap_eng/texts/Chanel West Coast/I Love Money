[Intro]
Drop an old school beat!

[Verse 1]
I said, beach house in the Hamptons
White on white phantom
I get so much attention you would think i threw a tantrum
On fire like I'm camping
Breakfast in my mansion
I stay so fly & high up in the sky call me captain captain!
I don't care if you understand the meaning but i won't stop pilling till cash hit the ceiling
Oh no no, you'll never get this moment
On my own & don't least i own it
Make you sick yea it got you don't it
Stay dripped while you stay lonely
Dime peace that rep Trojan
Time piece i stay frozen
I will never stop like the traffic lights be rolling

[Bridge]
I don't care if you understand the meaning but i won't stop pilling till cash hit the ceiling

[Hook]
I'm in love with the money with the money mane, so in love with the money with the money mane
I'm in love with the money with the money mane, so in love with the money with the money mane
I'm in love, make make make make make make make make make money money
Take take take take take take take take take money money
Make make make make make or take take take take take
My money never spent U.S Government

[Verse 2]
Oh i had to take off ...?
Oh you wanna take my bra off
Looking like a play boy bunny baby shake it get that money cause i stick to rapping call me honey
I don't care if you understand the meaning but i won't stop pilling till cash hit the ceiling
How i wan't it fast or slow
Don't matter when i get it just gimme the dough
................ Now it's time to be living it up not giving up fa damn sho'
If you wan't it daddy you gone need more then that caddy
I need a man that can hang & likes to smoke a fatty

[Bridge + Hook]

[Outro 2x]
Little blond bay, Pacito
They try & bite my style, mosquito
The boys be loving me, Libido
Not a ho or a tease, Tito

[Hook]
