[Intro]
Don’t ever let somebody tell you, you can’t do something
Not even me, alright? (alright)
You got a dream, you gotta protect it
People can't do something themselves
They wanna tell you that you can’t do it
You want something, go get it. Period
Yeah, West Coast, yup, uh huh
I remember when nobody believed in me
But now, I’m bout to prove them wrong

[Verse 1]
September first 88’. The first day of my fate
To be the greatest so I say this to myself, “I can’t wait”
I gotta put in work so I can get this money stacking
I gotta put in work so I can get the crowd reacting
You ain’t gonna be the best
I confess if you gonna be resting and don’t care
Still got a ways to go but my goal is to finish that lesson life ain’t fair
We are all just human in this life that’s for the proving
So many out there choosing to stay losing never moving
What you know about that life? So I can be living it right
Central pay in the summertime global express, private flights
Studios all night ain’t coming outside til the outcome right
Or out come the light, well my future bright
Hustle hard because you only get one life

[Chorus]
I’m on an elevator to my penthouse
Two fingers for the haters tell them “peace out”
I’m living major, now living my dreams out
Ain’t no contesting that all of your life’s just a lesson
I said nothing is going to stop me, nothing is going to stop me
I said nothing is going to stop me
Im gonna be whatever I want to be because nothing is going to stop me

[Verse 2]
Gonna be the cream of the crop, piling cream on top
With a mean drop top, my team don’t stop Man I sieze the top
When my album drop gonna seize the spot Like I just been shot
Go hard like rock, [???]
My time, tick tock, my whips ain’t stock
And I won’t stop til I get my props
I do it for myself, do it for my crew
We do it like stealth because you never see my crew
All eyez on me, that’s my favorite record
West coast I be, rapping Audrey Hepburn
I’m in my lane and I’m not ever pulling over
I like green and I’m not ever going sober
Know my name and the feel me just like a groper
On my campaign, household name like Oprah

[Chorus]
I’m on an elevator to my penthouse
Two fingers for the haters tell them “peace out”
I’m living major, now living my dreams out
Ain’t no contesting that all of your life’s just a lesson
I said nothing is going to stop me, nothing is going to stop me
I said nothing is going to stop me
Im gonna be whatever I want to be because nothing is going to stop me

[Bridge]
Haters want to hate us cause’ they can’t be us
We living for the moment, hold our hands way up
Nothing Is going to stop me, nothing is going to stop me
I said nothing is going to stop, nothing is going to stop
Whatever I want to be cause’ nothing is going to stop me

[Chorus]
I’m on an elevator to my penthouse
Two fingers for the haters tell them “peace out”
I’m living major, now living my dreams out
Ain’t no contesting that all of your life’s just a lesson
I said nothing is going to stop me, nothing is going to stop me
I said nothing is going to stop me
Im gonna be whatever I want to be because nothing is going to stop me
I’m on an elevator to my penthouse
Two fingers for the haters tell them “peace out”
I’m living major, now living my dreams out
Ain’t no contesting that all of your life’s just a lesson
I said nothing is going to stop me, nothing is going to stop me
I said nothing is going to stop me
Im gonna be whatever I want to be because nothing is going to stop me
