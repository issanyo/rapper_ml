West Coast (fades out)

Man, nobody gave me nada

Verse 1:
Presto, here I am, married to this shit, Vera Wang
Jordan rich, long been, I'm my own bitch, I stand
'Bout my money like Fort Knox
Nothin' funny like short cocks
They time runnin', tick tock
My time comin', kick rocks
Fu-future bright, like no shades
Out all night, like no days
Flows are tight, like new J's
Ho's, good night, duvet's
Won't stop 'til the clock stop tickin'
Won't flop, so chick stop wishin'
Will pop, yea, man on a mission
Thirty[?] pie, like raised in the kitchen

Hook:
Balmain-main, Givenchy and the Prada
I don't owe anybody cuz nobody gave me nada
Maintain-tain, we turn up when we wanna
We don't hear anybody, so nobody tell us nada
Nada, nada, nada, nada, nada
Nobody gave me nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada
So I don't ask for nada

Verse 2:
F the world, ain't waitin'
Gettin' it, stay patient
On fire like a cajun
Flyer than vacation
Got 'em scared like Jason
See you over there, you hatin'
Keep pushin' it, like skatin'
In the club, ass is shakin'
Take off in the Maserati
Paid this crib for the afterparty
Doin' shots, it's straight Bacardi
Puffin' some, feelin' naughty
And we gon' stay up all night
Louboutin's with the sleeks
Postin' pics, gettin' likes

Hook:
Balmain-main, Givenchy and the Prada
I don't owe anybody cuz nobody gave me nada
Maintain-tain, we turn up when we wanna
We don't hear anybody, so nobody tell us nada
Nada, nada, nada, nada, nada
Nobody gave me nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada
So I don't ask for nada

Verse 3:
We gonna turn up, dial on 10
Drink up, all weekend
Lined up, hello gin
Crew sick, medicine
Wherever we sit you ain't gettin' in
Whenever I spit they be rushin' in
I stay fit, bottom ends
Sweet but hip, cinnamon
I-I got this shit on lock, lock
Made that you ain't in my spot
You worn out like old socks
While I stay cookin', crock pots
Hands to the ceiling, no lames
Good feelin', Etta James
Stackin' chips, plantains
Got custom whips, all gold chains

Hook:
Balmain-main, Givenchy and the Prada
I don't owe anybody cuz nobody gave me nada
Maintain-tain, we turn up when we wanna
We don't hear anybody, so nobody tell us nada
Nada, nada, nada, nada, nada
Nobody gave me nada, nada, nada, nada, nada, nada
So I don't ask for nada

Outro:
Man, nobody gave me nada
These bitches got me lit, fucked up
Self-made, bitch
