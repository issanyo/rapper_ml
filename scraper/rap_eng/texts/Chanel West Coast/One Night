I only got one night, together
I only got one night, together
I only got one night, together
Every time that I see you make me think to the times when '
Didn't mean to be mien with a scene, on my lean to the lean
Got hit like a prospect wanna go back and tell you that ', don't even think to make your mind
This way they don't understand, I wish that you were taking the time
I've been around every since the day I head you move around
I've been so wrong but take to long to me to see you gone
Reaching, never ever go back like 'never ever be back
I don't know what I'm gonna do with that (that, that)
So, so let me know if you still wanna
I wish you know, no, no I don't know it
If you still are here anymore
Ooh wish you know
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
Don't want to see that, we can never be 'wanna play back
The time were shine we left behind 'like a through
I guess this is just our time
You do it yours when I'm all mine
Seems like we caught 'seems like can't hold the line
They're going like ...never got a...alone
Like a broken tape all for that damn broke '
Sometimes you just be like and this spot I should get right back
But I don't know if I can act that
So, so let me know if you still wanna
I wish you know, no, no I don't know it
If you still are here anymore
Ooh wish you know
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
I don't care what I look like ...it feels like to come under, to come under
I don't know if I can find and steal one, to love someone, to love someone
To fall in love, ...but I can't give up, '
To fall in love, ...but I can't give up, '
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
I only got one night, (one night, one night, one night) together, together
