[Hook]
Percocet, Molly, Percocet (Percocet)
Percocet, Molly, Percocet, Percocet
Rep the set, gotta rep the set (yee)
Chase a check, never chase a dick (nah)
Mask on, fuck it, fuck it, mask off (mask off)
Mask on, fuck it, fuck it, mask off, mask off

Chase a check, never chase a dick (chase a dick)

[Verse 1]
Fuck what you think
I been steady on that dank (that dank)
And on that drank
Slidin' through your city, city
Bitch, I'm in the private bank
Got more sense than common think
New whip, got the custom paint
Then that shit look pretty, pretty
Man, I'm feeling so good
I never stop toasting (nope)
Now I learned to swim good
I can thank Frank Ocean
YSL, stay fly as hell
Ain't hard to tell we so upscale
Stay popin' bands like Papa Kels
Pent house with the Benz
But that's on my nails yeh (yee)
That's a whole lot of money
Blokes still hating on me
But my fans riding for me (yeah)
Stack, stack, stack it up
Bitch, fix your face
Why you standing there
Watching us while we chasing pape's
Back, back, back it up
Stay in your place
I be at the party rolling up
Leaving the [?]

Bad bitch with a corporation
'Bout to cop a mansion
That's a big mortgage payment
Pointing to the sky
'Cause that's my direction (my)
They been about my styles
Yeah, One Direction (on my style)
I went from skateboard P to Lil' Uzi Vert
Smoking real OG, in the jacuzzi twerk (twerk)
Bitches can't compete [?]
Why you tryna creep, I can see you lurk
I make Justin Bieber, a believer (yee)
Had my ups and downs, Richie Akiva (heh-heh)
Yeah, I see you but I'm blind to it (blind)
So much weed in a bag
I had to grind to it (grind it up)
'Bout to cop three Benz's six, six, six
Fuck what I'm spending, tips, tips, tips
I stay on my hustle, nips, nips, nips (nips, nips)
I'ma rail like Russell, hits, hits, hits
