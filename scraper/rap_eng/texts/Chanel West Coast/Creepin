I got two glasses in the air, one on my lap
When a DJ playin that Beez in the Trap
They be staring at us like screens on the map
Can we move it so G like leads on a map
I had to stop for a second to catch my breath
Cause the smoke so vivid, you would think we lit
But we ainât done yet, gonna get more bent in the back (in the back)
Uh, the way youâve never seen the motherfucker
Quite like me I'm a safari
Doing... up in NYC drinking Martinies
Why youâre mad at me, foe?

Hook:
Weâre twisting up like a night skater
Higher than the fucking skyscrapers with a love flavor
Weâre lifting up like an elevator
Climbing like a trap vader, creeping like an alligator
Creeping like an alligator, creeping like an alligator
Creeping like an alligator, creeping like an alligator
I got a penthouse at the chateau
Bottles by the case load, models and some lace clothes
Popping out, so case closed
Show you where your face goes, just below my name, hoe!
Up against the bathroom door
Like I got you on my payrol
Work until I say so
I ainât gotta say no more
You see me drop it way low, spread it like a bagel
Homie, what you gonna do, huh?
Talking like you got some gumbaz
Youâre wacker than a fucking rumba
Iâmma stay doin me, hoo-rah!
Black elevator handbag on my lap
Stacking up this paper like Iâm paying up my tax
Bumping new... while Iâm coasting the...
Loving the people say, West Coast, just...

Hook:
Weâre twisting up like a ice skater
Higher than the fucking skyscrapers with a love flavor
Weâre lifting up like an elevator
Climbing like a trap vader, creeping like an alligator
Creeping like an alligator, creeping like an alligator
Creeping like an alligator, creeping like an alligator
Alligator, alligator, alligator, alligator
Alligator, alligator, alligator, alligator
I stay creeping, I stay creeping, I stay creeping
I stay creeping, I stay creeping, I stay creeping, uh
I stay creeping, I stay creeping, I stay creeping, aha
Creeping, creeping, creeping
