[Intro: Chanel]
It's not me or you, it's not me it's you
You're reckless and you know it, they don't love you like i do
Say you're moving on - well i guess that's just the motion

[Hook: Drake]
I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 1: Chanel]
I walked down some dark paths just to make it to the light
Had to spit some whack raps just to get my shit tight
People think it's a gimmick, just because my skin is white
Ain't no limit speeding past, motherfucker fifty-five
My first love was shot and killed, he was taken way too early
Left stains on my brain, how the world can do you dirty
But i know you're lookin down on me like a 630

[Hook: Drake]
I guess that's just the motion
Then the phone doesn't ring when they got everything - that's the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion

[Verse 2: Chanel]
They said "life is what you make it" so i'm gonna make it rich
In this life you gotta take it cause nobody give you shit
I sold weed with my mom so that we could pay the rent
I was trimming up the trees, listening to 50 Cent
So many ups and downs but you held me through it all
Never asked for nothing from me, just someone that i could call
Sometimes we don't see their worth 'til their walking out the door
One day you're rich, one day you're poor

[Hook: Drake]
I guess that's just the motion
She'll probably come around soon as i settle down - that's the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion
I guess that's just the motion

I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion, oooh
I guess that's just the motion
