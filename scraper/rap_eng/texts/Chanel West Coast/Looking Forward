[Intro]
Ooh, the death of my soul
Ooh, the death of my soul (sell, sell, sell)
Ooh, the death of my soul
Ooh, the death of my soul
West Coast
Uh, Young Money

[Verse 1]
I'm looking forward to the future so bright
I'm not looking back, 'bout to change my whole life
I've been hated on man, yeah all of my life
Yeah, yeah, all of my life, yeah, yeah, all of my life
I'm taking my time and make sure shit is right
Can't wait for the day that they say change their damn minds
And say damn Chanel tight, they said damn Chanel tight
They said damn Chanel tight, I'm in this for life
The struggle is real, yeah, I'm coming from Cali
Yeah, deep in the valley, North Hollywood
No one pay attention, no one ever mention
Alone like detention, so Hollywood
I gotta keep hustlin', no, I'm never budgin'
'Til I get a budget, what's really good?
Ain't up for discussion, blow up like combustion
Haters, yeah, we shush 'em, I wish you would

[Chorus]
Times up, don't fuck with my money
I pile up, you bitches ain't hungry
Dubs stay up, cuz that's where I'm from G
And I'm never leaving like spring is the season
But it's always my season
Death to the hate, I can't hear it
What is that sound? I hear cheerin'
Fans went from one to a million
Ooh, the death of my soul
Ooh, the death of my soul

[Verse 2]
While you all in my business, I'm all 'bout my business
Ain't nothing fictitious, I'm hunting these bishes
They cut like incisions, I'm taking position
To take their position cuz I got ambition, I got it
I ain't had no love when I started
No one thought I could be an artist
But as I got older, my flows just got colder
The life of a soldier, brave-hearted

[Bridge]
I did it to only break out
From folding these clothes at checkout
Minimum wage ain't what's up, need more bucks
Cuz' I want a new car and a house
I'm fighting to be more, that's why
I just want to see more in life
So fuck all the hate, they don't pay for my play
I won't stop till I'm great, this my life

[Chorus]
D-D-Don't fuck with my money
I pile up, you bitches ain't hungry
Dubs stay up, cuz that's where I'm from G
And I'm never leaving like spring is the season
But it's always my season
Death to the hate, I can't hear it
What is that sound? I hear cheerin'
Fans went from one to a million
Ooh, the death of my soul
Ooh, the death of my soul

[Outro]
Ya'll always got your faith you know, you can ride anything. Theres-theres nothing too scary where I'ma just give up, ya know what I mean? I've seen hell and everyhthing after it. I'm somwhere where, if you're persistent and efficient you get rewarded... and that's what everybody wishes for
