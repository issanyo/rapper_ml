[Chorus]
Drippin' in that ice, sippin' on that Bacardi
Out for the night and I don't fuck with nobody
I ain't got no time for you if you ain't ballin'
I offended you probably, no, I never say sorry

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, keep on walkin', I don't fuck with nobody
I offended you probably, I don't fuck with nobody
Baby, keep on walkin', I don't fuck with nobody
I offended you probably, I don't fuck with nobody

[Verse 1]
Don't fuck with nobody, I don't know nobody
These bitches get bodied like it's a hobby, secret society
I'm up at the party, no, they can't fuck with me
They down in the lobby
So they can't find me a man if you stuck with me
I stay in my zone, I stay in my zone
I stay in my zone, yeah
I feel like I'm gone, I feel like I'm gone
Give me one more, yeah
Don't need no drama, just need that Prada
Balenciaga, get what I want, ballin' all I want

[Chorus]
Drippin' in that ice, sippin' on that Bacardi
Out for the night and I don't fuck with nobody
I ain't got no time for you if you ain't ballin'
I offended you probably, no, I never say sorry

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, keep on walkin', I don't fuck with nobody
I offended you probably, I don't fuck with nobody
Baby, keep on walkin', I don't fuck with nobody
I offended you probably, I don't fuck with nobody

[Verse 2]
Do what I love, do what I want
High on life, yeah, I'm so fucked up
Get it every morning, bitch, don't pass it on
This my fuckin' moment, had to tear it up
We live it up, passin' them drugs
Smashin' the club
My ex man passin' 'em up
With the stash in the trunk
[?] cocaine white
That means I stay in the cut
Passin' the buck, guessin' 'em up
That's right, I don't give a fuck
I guess that's just your karma at the door showin' up

[Chorus]
Drippin' in that ice, sippin' on that Bacardi
Out for the night and I don't fuck with nobody
I ain't got no time for you if you ain't ballin'
I offended you probably, no, I never say sorry

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, keep on walkin', I don't fuck with nobody
I offended you probably, I don't fuck with nobody
Baby, keep on walkin', I don't fuck with nobody
I offended you probably, I don't fuck with nobody
