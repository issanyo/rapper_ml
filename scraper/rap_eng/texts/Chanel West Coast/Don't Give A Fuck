I'll never forget this night
I'm a live it up, oh, I'm a live it up
I'll do whatever I like
I don't give a fuck, oh, I don't give a fuck

Walk up to the front, no line for me!
You know how I do
I'm VIP

Ain't no list, they know my face
Red roast lip and then I'm in this place
Straight to my table, drinks awaitin
Time to get crazy, let's get wasted
Poppin bottles, pourin' shots
Lookin' like a model, I'm so hot
You know how I do I'm here to rock
Me and my crew got the spot on lock
Sipin on booze, Gettin tossed, Gettin loose, feelin lost

I think tonight I might do somethin wrong
But it's alright cause I'm so gone

I'm still young
Just livin life gonna have fun
And live it up tonight

I'll never forget this night
I'm a live it up, oh, I'm a live it up
I'll do whatever I like
I don't give a fuck, oh, I don't give a fuck

Musics in me, flown through my veins
Goin crazy, goin insane
Dancin on tables, spilling drinks
I don't really care what anyone thinks
I'm doin me, do what I want
I love to party, can't get enough
I'm addicted to it like a drug
I do it big when. I'm at the club

Lost my purse and my iPhone
I don't even Know how
I'm gettin home
But it's alright, I'm not trippin
I'm so hot I'm so lifted
Acting wrong miss behaving
Been home all day paper chasing
Time to let go, let's qet wasted
L-let's get wasted

I'll never forget this night
I'm a live it up, oh, I'm a live it up
I'll do whatever I like
I don't give a fuck, oh, I'm a live it up

I'll never forget this night
I'm a live it up, oh, I'm a live it up
I'll do whatever I like
I don't give a fuck, oh, I don't give a fuck

I, I, I, I don't, I don't, I don't, give, give
I don't give, I don't give, I don't give, I don't give
I don't give a, I don't give a
I don't give a, I don't give a
I don't give a fuck
