It's suicide, you and I the more we try the more I cry
No way out like I'm doin time
God, help me out save my life
No no no way, I can't hide the way I feel
I need to find a way, to know what is and isn't real
I found out today, things are no longer great
You are gonna have to pay for all the love you gave away
You're a f*cking lier but still you I desire
Gave you all of me said I'd always be your rida
My friends calling me loco
I should leave tomorrow
Need to just break free but I'm in love so
You got me spun out my mind loaded gun
You make me numb, caught up in this punch drunk love
You got me spun out my mind loaded gun
You make me numb, caught up in this punch drunk love
It feels like every time like we making progress
Then you turn around I'll be home late tonight
It's business
Next day you acting, somewhat distant
Don't know if I am trippin or if it's good intuition
Even tho you lie before I let you roam
But you ain't puntin me first an that shit I can't condone
If we respect each other then who cares who right or wrong
We protect each other, honesty don't let us fall
Tears me up inside
How did we get lost can we survive, we do it for the love
So much lost why do I even try, we could be alright, on my new wings so I can fly
Rescue me from all these lies, I keep coming back and I don't know why
You are a f*cking lier but still you I desire
Gave you all of me said Id always be your rida
My friends calling me loco
I should leave you tomorrow
Need to just break free but I'm in love so
You got me spun out my mind loaded gun
You make me numb, caught up in this punch drunk love
You got me spun out my mind loaded gun
You make me numb, caught up in this punch drunk love
It's suicide, you and I the more we try the more I cry
No way out like I'm do in time
God, help me now save my life
No no no way, I can hide the way I feel
I need to find a way to know what is and isn't real
About that day, things are no longer great
You gonna have to pay for all the love you gave away
You are a f*cking lier but still you I desire
Gave you all of me said I'd always be your rider
My friends calling me loco
I should leave tomorrow
Need to just break free but I'm in love so
You got me spun out my mind loaded gun
You make me numb, caught up in this punch drunk love
You got me spun out my mind loaded gun
You make me numb, caught up in this punch drunk love
