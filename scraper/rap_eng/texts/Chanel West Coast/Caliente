[Hook: Chanel West Coast]
Uh, drinkin' all night till the sun rise
I'm feelin' high like a fuckin' fly
And I don't give a fuck what you tryna do
Top of the world, got a penthouse view
I got that cali-caliente, fuck 'um if they won't play
Cali-caliente, I'm hungry, these hoes thirsty
Ca-cali-caliente, stackin' money all day
Ca-cali-caliente, serve these chicken satay

[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
Sit-sit-sit back in the back
In the Maybach, Instagram a selfie
Ge-ge-ge-get them stacks
Till the stacks so high I'm Oprah-wealthy
Hi-hi-hi-hit it good
If you ever wanna kick it [with] Chelsea
I-I-I wish they would
On fire these dudes call me [?]
Caliente, suavemente
My glass half full, your glass half empty
Condo so high they need a lift pass
When I drive by your man, get whiplash
Smoke one for the homies, sippin' on the forty
Chillin' at the cribbo, yeah, I keep it low key
Don't think you know me, I'm a different breed
Wanna know me, C dub' C
West Coast reppin' with Dr. Greenthumb
Caliente, 'bout to smoke some
OG rolled up, if you feel me poem
If you hatin' hold up, if you smokin', smoke up

[Hook: Chanel West Coast]
Uh, drinkin' all night till the sun rise
I'm feelin' high like a fuckin' fly
And I don't give a fuck what you tryna do
Top of the world, got a penthouse view
I got that cali-caliente, fuck 'um if they won't play
Cali-caliente, I'm hungry, these hoes thirsty
Ca-cali-caliente, stackin' money all day
Ca-cali-caliente, serve these chicken satay

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Get it hot when it drop, let it pop off
We get up on the spot, let it top off
Greenthumb in a burn, money growups
Fuck around, put you in the Smokebox
We get high all day, doctor sells and you buy all day
Doctor's gone and you cry all day
No one told you get high all day
Chanel in the West keep it live all day
Haters deny but say I'd bite of [?]
For a little more time, they align [?]
Take another hit and fly away

[Hook: Chanel West Coast]
Uh, drinkin' all night till the sun rise
I'm feelin' high like a fuckin' fly
And I don't give a fuck what you tryna do
Top of the world, got a penthouse view
I got that cali-caliente, fuck 'um if they won't play
Cali-caliente, I'm hungry, these hoes thirsty
Ca-cali-caliente, stackin' money all day
Ca-cali-caliente, serve these chicken satay
