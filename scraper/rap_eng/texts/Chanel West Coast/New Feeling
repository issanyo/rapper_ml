[Verse 1]
It's-it's like the first time I had sex
First time I cashed a check
First time I drove a Benz
And the first time I held a pen
This that feeling they talk about
All eyes on you when you walkin' out
Chips all in and I'm cashin' out
Whips on gleam cuz I'm showin' out
I'm sinnin' and winnin' at the same time
Make a livin', I'm finnin' to get mine
You timid, stay hidden on the sidelines
I'm chillin', keep hittin', it's game time
I'm that bitch you mad at
Cuz I'm good and you bad at it
Mad cuz you home and you want my spot
Hatin' on me from your fucking laptop
Waitin' on me trying to see what I got
No deba-ting, give it all that I got
If they ha-ting, keep climbin' to the top
Call me Satan cuz I'm just that hot
I be ska-ting past you in a drop
Like we ma-ting, I'm, I'm about to pop
Sky's the limit, huh, maybe for her
I just made a left past Jupiter

Hook:
This that new feelin', hands up to the ceilin'
Somethin' I never felt before, I'm high on life to touch the floor This that new feelin', hands up to the ceilin'
Somethin' I never felt before, I'm high on life to touch the floor
T-T-T-This that new feeling, new-new-new feeling
This that new feeling, new-new-new feeling
This that new feeling, new-new-new feeling
I'm high on life to touch the floor
I'm high on life to touch the floor
Floor

Verse 2:
Di-diamond top, Givenchy clutch
Sip Ciroc, smoke a dutch
No shot, royal flush
Drop top, interior is plush
Drop down, get your eagle on
Roc, Roc The Mic, Beanie Sigel song
Got, got it right like my left was gone
I'm up all night like a case in the morning
Never gonna quit, never gonna stop gettin' it, gettin' it
This feeling is sick, I love straight killin' it, killin' it
Party all night, up, up all day, day, day
More 24's than Kiefer play, play, play
I'm going hard Ron Jeremy, mey, mey, mey, mey
I'm takin' off like close your tray, tray, tray
Love for the world but I'm from L.A., lay, lay
This be the, this be the shit make you wanna say, say, say

Hook:
This that new feelin', hands up to the ceilin'
Somethin' I never felt before, I'm high on life to touch the floor This that new feelin', hands up to the ceilin'
Somethin' I never felt before, I'm high on life to touch the floor
T-T-T-This that new feeling, new-new-new feeling
This that new feeling, new-new-new feeling
This that new feeling, new-new-new feeling
I'm high on life to touch the floor
I'm high on life to touch the floor
Floor

Verse 3:
I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin', I'm walkin' on air
(I'm walkin' on, walkin' on air)
They talkin', they talkin', they talkin' but I don't care
(care, ca-ca-ca-care)
I'm holdin', I"m holdin', I"m holdin' my hands in the air
(yea, yea, yea, yea, yea)
This feelin', this feelin', this feelin', I can't compare
('pare, p-p-p-'pare)

Hook:

I'm high on life to touch the floor
