[Verse 1]
Countin' money every day
Baggin' chips, Frito-Lay
They want to see you fall like a domino
But I'ma keep it tight like a pantyhose
They don't know ya, ain't never there
But count your digits, wanna share
Bitch, you better get it all on your own
You only come around when I'm in the zone
I'ma do me, I don't care
It's a celebration, we hot this year

[Hook]
Countin' money, yeah, we made it
Rollin' Swishers on the daily
They ain't never 'round when we workin', yup
Bet they showin' now 'cause we turnin' up
Countin' money, yeah, we made it
Rollin' Swishers, on the daily
They ain't never 'round when we workin', yup
Bet they showin' now 'cause we turnin' up

[Verse 2]
Sentimental, they stupid mad
Makin' comments on my Instagram
Why you so concerned with what I do? (I do, I do)
Is it 'cause I'm me and you mad at you? (you, you)
Get a grip, I don't know ya

[Verse 3]
Now if you countin' money, girl, you ain't wrong (you ain't wrong)
Go 'head and shake that ass 'cause this ya song (ya song)
All I see is those that wanna judge us
But really they just wanna fuckin' hug us
Don't hate (nah, nah), don't hate (nah, nah)
'Cause we ain't that different now (ayy)
Don't hate (nah, nah), don't hate (nah, nah)
