[Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on

[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
Love it or leave it, call me conceited
Putting in work, since I first heard 'Beat it'
Chumps just beat it, try won't see it
Music in my blood, yeah man I bleed it
All white Jimmy Choos, all night getting loose
We feel alright off the grey goose, haunt to the crowd like I'm Babe Ruth, uh-huh
I ain't stopping, big things popping, sick whips copping
Uh-huh, Thick like Robin, too sick like we coughing
And I'm not the one, don't ever play me out with another one
You might be the top who just can't have won, so I'ma take off like a dish out the gun
Peel out in my new Benz, on my way to one though
Got some old and new friends, roll up cause we gon' smoke

[Bridge: Chanel West Coast]
Let's set the record straight right now, I ball all day and they ask me how
You coming up, I been on top, sitting on these sons so I'm extra hot
Look boy, I been that show, roll up with me and I been that good
Bounce back, can we do that, everybody know me cause

[Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on

[Verse 2: French Montana]
Get on my level (level), get on my level (level)
Get on my level (level), get on my level (level)
Get on my level (level), get on my level (level)
Get on my level (level), get on my level (level)
My niggas ball out and drink 'till I fall out, when it's time to go hard, know I bring it all out
Got a body full of ink, bladder full of drank, Jeter in the field, Carter in the paint
That purple in the air, I'm smoking, spaceship sunroof open
Give a fuck about the hate, got a crib with a lake and a pocket full of cake, I'm focused, huh
Blue Mulsanne, twenty-two chains, couple bad bitches, doing group things
LV shoes, no shoes strings, and know we ball out, toke a lou thing
Smoke what I wanna (wanna), drink what I wanna (wanna)
You know I been on (on), and fuck what you thought, huh

[Bridge: Chanel West Coast]
Let's set the record straight right now, I ball all day and they ask me how
You coming up, I been on top, sitting on these sons so I'm extra hot
Look boy, I been that show, roll up with me and I been that good
Bounce back, can we do that, everybody know me cause

[Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
I've been on, I've been on
