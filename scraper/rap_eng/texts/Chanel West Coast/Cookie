If you want a treat, my cookie is vanilla
Her cookie might be sweet, but my cookie is killa

Snicker doodle sweetie pie I get it from my moms
My cookie so delicious like the Bomb.com
All the girls are haters cuz I got the boys fantasizing me
With so much flavor yeah my cookie is so appetizing
Cookie fresh baked, so warm and so soft
Serve it to you on a plate, like Kit-Kat break you off
Covered in sprinkles, caramel, and whipped cream
Bring out some banana too, now we doing big things
Cookie so addicting you'll be craving more
I'll dress up like a girl scout and deliver to your door
In the kitchen baking getting ready for dessert
Make sure you wear an apron or youll get it on your shirt

Eat eat my cookie and dont leave a crumb. bang bang on this
Beat till the police come. (4x)
