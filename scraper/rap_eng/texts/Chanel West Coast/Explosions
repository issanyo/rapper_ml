It was me on that road
But you couldn't see me
Too many lights out, but nowhere near here
It was me on that road
Still you couldn't see me
And then flashlights
And explosions
And explosions
Am I keen to pain the rain same color as the nails I got today
Channel bag 'cause it cost
So swag, stay the course and f*ck the pain
All that, lack three strikes, pull strings like three kites
You pussy like three dykes, stay up for three nights
I'm taking off, G soft gliding, you soft
I see you hot then future bright, he ain't stopped it
You break a lot, why, I be grinding and I'm on that, fantastic good
Drive slow but rode past your team, get dough and manufacture green
Smoke dro like a past this teen, now ride low even though stakes is high
Get dough, try to kick it to the sky and I go, boy, I ain't got one
Six weeks, six beats and you will see one
You will see one, you will see one, you will see one
Explosions
And explosions
Cool parties, large stakes, new Rarries, large gates
You probably hate me, just wait, that booth good woke up and ate a crate
Yeah, man, I'm doing it, love is sick like a
Bitch, you just new to this, I've been pursuing this
Get a grip, get a whole bag, rich skills, bitch, you a tramp
My bills pay your stack, damn, girl, you just so whack
F*ck around for her purse, damn, a couple more for her birthday
That's dead, call the hearse, man, you just too thirsty
Explosions
And explosions
Holding up, I'm swaging, mad black, G wagging
We hot like dragon, them not, they lacking
All night, no napping, kicking dirt but no wrecking
Feeling us like they grabbing, on point like we serving
I've been on game since the first grade, I learned a lot like a first day
Nip a Jack, never thirsty, I wear 'em out like Jersey
Some love me, some hate me, at least it ain't no maybe
I'm from the west, Kim's baby, Cali girl like Kates
Explosions
And explosions
