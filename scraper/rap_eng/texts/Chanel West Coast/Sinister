[Verse 1]
I'm spending money, gigantic
Got all you livin' in panic
You goin' down like Titanic
As I make off like a bandit
I make you nuts like you manic
My style nuts, you can't stand it
The best cuts on the planet
I'm 'bout to bust out like Janet
You must respect, I demand it
I'm raisin' hell, I goddammit
I don't sip drinks 'cause I slam it
Livin' so reckless, Cabana
My turn up run it, you ran it
My skin so golden, I tan it
If I fuck up then I planned it
Drink shots with nobody standin' (standin')

[Hook]
This life got me sinnin' (x8)
This life got me sinnin' (I'm feelin' sinister) (x8)

[Verse 2]
I don't go down low (low)
'Til you go down low (low)
You can talk that shit
But don't you quit when I'm 'bout to go (go)
I can hit this shit like I hit that dro (dro)
And the way you be feelin'
Half spinnin' you be finnin' to keep it slow
I don't, I don't give a shit if you stay or go
'Cause when we done hittin', we winnin'
Stay hidden no one got to know
I'm the best to ever do it, know you like this
Above the rest, so pursue it, show you like this
I know you goin' down tonight like the fight fixed
See you workin' it tonight like the night shift

[Hook]
This life got me sinnin' (x8)
This life got me sinnin' (I'm feelin' sinister) (x4)
This life got me sinnin' (x4)

[Verse 3]
When I'm sinnin' I'm winnin', steal cars, I'm driven
Can't wait to go all 'dem places in the world I ain't been in
Summer sheets be linen, get no run like you sittin'
May act a little crazy, but that's the mood I be in
Like an addict with no dope, know me in the street
Automatic is my flow, don't even need a beat
Get so high but stay low, might see me in a Jeep
Ridin' to my next show, might peep it in this week

[Hook]
This life got me sinnin' (x8)
This life got me sinnin' (I'm feelin' sinister) (x8)
