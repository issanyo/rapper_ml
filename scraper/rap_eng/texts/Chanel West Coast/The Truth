[Intro:]
Yeah...
It's yo girl Chanel
West Coast

[Verse 1:]
My music is incandescent
I spit like a deli weapon
No meat for me to threaten but you haters better get to steppin'
West side I'mma stay reppin'
Stay spittin' [?] Stay lookin' bomb
Smokin' on that bomb
You know I'm the lady [?]
Gonna get it poppin' later [?]
I gotta hit the bong it's 4:20 in the afternoon
You don't need to tell me that I got an attitude
You just keep on passing through
Let me do what I gotta do
Stop makin' ya hater moves
Stop makin' assumptions
I don't need no interruption
This world is filled with corruption and destruction
I think we need a solution
Until it pass [?] is really no conclusion
Just confusion
You wanna battle me?
Prepare for execution
Cause I'm refusin' to be the one losing

[Chorus:]
This the truth
Find a place to place it
This the truth
Nobody can erase it
This the truth
You can love it or hate it
I'm the muthafuckin' truth and y'all just gotta face it
[x2]

[Verse 2:]
My flows are versatile
I make 'em worth your while
'Though I'm a juvenile delinquent
[?] when I'm speakin'
My knowledge I reconcile
So you better believe it
My looks are deceiving
Some things I say are obscene
But I'mma rap queen a true poetical [?]
Incredible dreams I keep focus like a [?]
To me rapping is easy like the [?]
I got that hot shit in the stove
This ain't no topless bar
But I spit these musical bars
Sweet like a candy bar
I only use them beats that's raw
And my knowledge is [?] like Anthrax
Yes I'm a [?]
Somebody hand me the Tampax
I think it's that time of the month
Cause I ain't havin' that shady stuff
A lot of people hate me much
But trust
I ain't some bitch from The Brady Bunch

[Chorus:]
This the truth
Find a place to place it
This the truth
Nobody can erase it
This the truth
You can love it or hate it
I'm the muthafuckin' truth and y'all just gotta face it
[x2]

This the truth
...
This the truth
You can love it or hate it
I'm the muthafuckin' truth and y'all just gotta face it

[Verse 3:]
Poetry is my soul and poetry is my mind
Poetical genius, call me one of a kind
I'm just speakin' with rhyme
I'm speakin' with intelligence
Rappin' ain't a hobby I don't rap for the hell of it
I rap for the love of music, don't rap for the dough
I don't rap for these haters
And I don't rap for these hoes
I rap for reality, I rap for my relief
I rap with mentality and I rap for the streets
I rap to these beats
Gotta have some form of expression
Just turn up the volume
Let me cease my depression with aggression
So much misery in life we live
Spitefulness
But you gotta know your right to live
Right to give your freedom of speech
That's why we live in America, yeah
Flow with your words
Who give a fuck what they heard
Who give a fuck if they scared of your speech
[?] straight shoot
You gotta do what a playa' do

[Chorus:]
This the truth
Find a place to place it
This the truth
Nobody can erase it
This the truth
You can love it or hate it
I'm the muthafuckin' truth and y'all just gotta face it
