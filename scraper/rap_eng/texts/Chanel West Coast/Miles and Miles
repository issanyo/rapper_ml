[Intro]
(I see you from miles away, ay, ay, ay)
(Skillz, Skillz, Skillz, Skillz)
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
Uh huh

[Verse 1]
Can I see a billion dollars, live big like a Wallace (Wallace)
Can I reach a billion ballers, sun tan in the Bahamas (Hamas)
If we all live honest, will we all see promise? (promise)
With the future upon us, why the past still haunt us? (haunt us)
Got the gift to get the shit I always wanted
Never sip a sip unless I dun bought it
And the truth of it is that I live for it
And they hatin' it just because they want it
And I can't get mad at 'em
But I will get back at 'em
'Bout the way that they spend my money
Drive off and I never look back at 'em
Peace
Poppin' bottles at the bar now
So they see us from afar now
Fuck a back table, where's the glass
Spend some cash, hold it up
Dance, you the star now

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I-I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
We see you, we see from miles
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
We see you, we see from miles
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
We see you, we see from miles
We see you, we see from miles
Away-way-way-way-way-way-way

[Verse 2]
It's like pandemonium
Got 'em all gassed up, Imodium
Got my feet on the ground, linoleum
Play my cards right, you foldin' 'em
I never did shit for the sake of just gettin' rich, rich
So I paid my dues in this life tryna' be that bitch, bitch
I never thought twice if I'd hit
Like they lobbed me a pitch, pitch
We party all night, stay lit
Like up on a switch, switch
Had to stand on my own
Cuz my house ain't a home
And the love never came
So the lane that I chose
Was to go for the fame
Try to get it on my own
So fuck all the hate, gettin' paid is my song
And I'm gonna sing it all night
And I'm gonna bring it all night
Take care haters, fuck you
I see you, no flashlight

[Chorus]
I-I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
We see you, we see from miles
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
We see you, we see from miles
I see you from miles away, na, na, na, na, na
We see you, we see from miles
We see you, we see from miles
Away-way-way-way-way-way
