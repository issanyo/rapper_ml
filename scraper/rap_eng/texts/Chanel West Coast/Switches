Verse 1:
Yea
Ya'll bitches don't know whatchu talkin' 'bout
Few hundred thousand followers with no records out
Don't be jealous cuz I'm makin' fella's get aroused
Ya'll lookin' up to me but can't see me, eyebrows
Got 3 felonies lookin' like a cheerleader
Blonde bombshell makin' hits, Derek Jeter
Wife beater, two seater, blazin' like a heater
New heater, be the baddest London tourisita
And ya'll make think ya'll know me from the TV
But you'll never know what it takes to be me
'6-4 Impala money green, call it seaweed
Blazin' on that sticky icky green, I call it kiwi
You bitches out of commission, killin' 'em, need a physician
You're reachin' for my position, this is a bad decision
Tell me who gave you permission, cuz my homies they listen
They in the black Expedition, I got the key in ignition

The next in line, yea, I got it

Got ya'll nervous like 'rotic
New Bentley GT I bought it
What you learnin' I taught it

All the shots, yea, I called it
Fendi leopard skin wallet
Sippin' vodka and tonic

Newest Coach[?] yea I'm on it
We spend notes and I floss it
White girl on that came off it
'Bout my business, I boss it
Whatchu thinkin' I thought it
Reppin' this thing and I brought it
Back fo' yo money like audit
I got the grown, yea I hold it
Stop and shine, yea I stole it
Only reason you own it
Is the fact that I sold it
On my iPhone 4 and you a Blackberry Bold chick
Antarctica flow, yea I'm spittin' the coldest
Crazy blast, make a toast
