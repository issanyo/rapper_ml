[Verse 1]
You can find me at the [?] in the tropics
Where the mixtape? Saying "'bout to drop this"
Gucci bag with a tag, I might return it
Hit a blunt too late, I think I burnt it
Shout out to my fans, they been riding before I am
Underground garage in the crib so I can hide them
Everywhere I go they know I'm down like I'm diving
I been hot so long that my name should be island

[Pre-Hook]
I don't know what they gon' talk about now
Is it my whips or my crazy lifestyle?
Jump in the Global Express [?]
Ain't got no stress except where is my crown?

[Hook]
Get a bag, make 'em mad everywhere we go
Taking snaps, sipping back, everywhere we go
Play my song, they know I'm on everywhere we go
Don't take our zone, team is strong everywhere we go

[Verse 2]
I'm just tryna kick it, these dudes all wanna hit it
I ain't giving out my digits, y'all just need to quit it
I'ma get it, you know I'm the sickest
Getting rich or [?] living like a princess
I don't need no neck, I need my bag
Let's celebrate and raise the glass
They hella late, just taking naps
Been sleeping on me like it's class
I keep rising, they won't last
Perfect timing, there is my chance
Silver lining in my pad
I stay riding, never crash

[Pre-Hook]
I don't know what they gon' talk about now
Is it my whips or my crazy lifestyle?
Jump in the Global Express [?]
Ain't got no stress except where is my crown?

[Hook]
Get a bag, make 'em mad everywhere we go
Taking snaps, sipping back, everywhere we go
Play my song, they know I'm on everywhere we go
Don't take our zone, team is strong everywhere we go
