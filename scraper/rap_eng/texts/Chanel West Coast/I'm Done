Baby I'm done
Wth being a fool
I'm so fed up
I'm over you
Baby I'm done

What was I doing
What was I thinkin
You were no good for me, please believe it
Lies were convincing so desieving
I should of known that day I'd be leaving
But now you lost me
And I ain't coming back
Why you gotta do me so wrong like that?
This time I won't fight back, hard for me to take it
I thought you were my man, I was mistaken

Had your last chance should of taken it
I ain't looking back, I know you hatin it
I'm on a steady path, I'm gonna make it big
Heading to the top, I know you'll miss me
Should of taken a second thought before you dissed me
Cause I look so hot, no I can't resist me
You already lost this spot, Your history
Time for you to rock, your misery!

Baby I'm done
Wth being a fool
I'm so fed up
I'm over you

Baby I'm done
Wth being a fool
I'm so fed up
I'm over you
Baby I'm done

Gave you my love
But boy you wasted
Now I'm gonna take it
Take it all back
Take it all back
Take it all back

When we first started dating everything was great
Then you played me now I don't wanna see your face
A million guys wanna date me
But I wasted my time waiting around on you for you to change your life
So I make sure that you feel my pain
Time for you to hurt, hope you living in shame
Cause I didn't deserve to lay abusive words
Nothing but a joke, to me your lower than dirt
Even though you ain't broke money can't buy you love
So I'm a get ghost and ride high above
To another level you abused my trust
Time for me to forget you, I'd done and had enough
But I don't regret you, you taught me many lessons
Now I will correct you, by keeping it steppin
You'll be depressed now that you neglected
I'm sorry to upset you but it's time to end it

Baby I'm done
With being a fool
I'm so fed up
I'm over you

Baby I'm done
Wth being a fool
I'm so fed up
I'm over you
Baby I'm done

Baby I'm done
Not gonna allow you to bring me down, no
So I'm leaving now, and I'm never looking back
No never looking back, Never looking back

Gave you my love but boy you wasted, Now I'm gonna take it
Take it all back, Take it all back, Take it all back

Baby I'm done
Wth being a fool
I'm so fed up
I'm over you
Baby I'm done

Baby I'm done
Wth being a fool
I'm so fed up
I'm over you
Baby I'm done
