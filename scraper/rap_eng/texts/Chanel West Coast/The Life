[Verse 1: Chanel West Coast]
Woke up bright and early, it's a new day
Looking at the mirror in a new way
Never thought I'd break out from it all
At all
Smiling while l'm lacing up my new J's
The sun is shining all in my face
Always get back up after I fall
That's all
And now I'm never gon' stop
'Til their jaws drop
Like a pawn shop stay open
'Til my song pops on the top charts
Hear bombs drop, I'm going
All my family need is some money
Where my fans that say that they love me?
I'll be damned if I ain't more hungry
Than that chick with a model-flat stomach
I want

[Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
The life, the life
My motherfucking life
It's like, it's like
I live in black and white
And that's how it be
The both parts of me
The life, the life
My motherfucking life
It's like, it's like
I live in black and white
And that's how it be
The both parts of me

[Post Chorus: Chanel West Coast & Rockie Fresh]
The life, aye, the life, aye, the life
No matter what they say now, I know I'm gettin' that
The life, aye, the life, aye, the life
No matter what they say now, I know I'm gettin' that

[Verse 2: Rockie Fresh]
Yeah, young Rockie, I'm getting that
Smoking blunts while I'm sitting back
I killed the game, I killed the track
Me and Daily was riding round that L.A. in them BMDubs
Trying to shop this music round
But weren't nobody trynna show us love
But now we living that life, and it feels so good
I'd probably do this shit twice
Put my Rollie on and it's bright
If you rolling round with me then you're rolling up the best smoke
Young homie from Chi-town with a real one
Chanel West Coast
Let's get it

[Chorus: Chanel West Coast]
The life, the life
My motherfucking life
It's like, it's like
I live in black and white
And that's how it be
The both parts of me
The life, the life
My motherfucking life
It's like, it's like
I live in black and white
And that's how it be
The both parts of me

[Post Chorus: Chanel West Coast & Rockie Fresh]
The life, aye, the life, aye, the life
No matter what they say now, I know I'm gettin' that
The life, aye, the life, aye, the life
No matter what they say now, I know I'm gettin' that
