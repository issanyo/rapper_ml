[Verse 1: Insane D]
Scream, I can't wait to hear it
Bodies all around you
I know you fear it
Blood on my hands and I have to smear it on the wall
Never stall when the demons call
Maul on your flesh like it's my last supper
You tried to get away but you ain't fast enough fucker
Try to escape, I'll make your new cuts deeper
Tales from the crypt
I'm the new crypt keeper
Call me a murderer, that ain't the half of it
I can hear her yelling stop, I just can't quit
Till she forfeits and I'm carving up her tits
I love the sick shit
I got to admit that the demons in my head won't let me free
They feed off the negativity of your energy
I can't see when this darkness surrounds me
My skin's feeling cold, I think the reaper done found me

[Hook:  Ian Stone]
What I've done, I've become
This machine, feel so numb
It's so obvious (x2)
I'm done, murder was what was done
Bodies laid, graves are dug
It's so obvious (x2)
I've done, what I've done

[Verse 2:  Ian Stone]
And it was obvious
It was a blood bath
Cause I was dragging her body to the car
And thinking at last
Cause I'm gonna fuck her
And then I'm gonna cut her
Make her suck my dick
And look at pictures of her mother
There's no one else like you, I know I can't help it
Your skin, your body, your hair, I feel selfish
But I'm feeling like if you lie this much you can't exist
Possessed, your fucking ignorance surrendered by your kids
Little Katie and Bobby they're both dead
I severed all their arteries and cut off their head
I slept in their bed, crying at night why did I do it?
I didn't mean to baby, I have video to prove it
If you don't believe me then I'll have to kill you too
I'm sorry about your baby girl, I'm manic but who knew
But if I gotta kill again it's gonna be you
I'm sorry but I really don't know what else to do

[Hook:  Ian Stone]
What I've done, I've become
This machine, feel so numb
It's so obvious (x2)
I'm done, murder was what was done
Bodies laid, graves are dug
It's so obvious (x2)
I've done, what I've done

[Verse 3: King Gordy]
I don't need no knife to stab you
I'll open and slice you with glass too
I'm hoping you like when I thrash you
I'm hoping you die from these stab wounds
I'll go for a pipe then attack you
Cut the throat of your wife to get at you
She's soaked in blood, right in the bathroom
This guy'll be back soon
When he arrives I should go and hang in the back room
With the knife, it's dying to give his spine a tattoo

[Verse 4: Bizarre]
Do you believe in Jesus? Or do you believe in me?
Gauge to your head, I want to see you fuckin beat
Finally free, ready to roam Louisville slugger
I break all your bones
Kill anybody, wife, kid or slut
Who the fuck you think ate Jeffrey Dahmer up?
I'm the wildest rapper on the universe
2010 I'll return to the Earth

[Hook:  Ian Stone]
What I've done, I've become
This machine, feel so numb
It's so obvious (x2)
I'm done, murder was what was done
Bodies laid, graves are dug
It's so obvious (x2)
I've done, what I've done
