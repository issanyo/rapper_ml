[Intro]
Rise children
Rise children!
RISE!

[Verse 1]
You got lions and tigers that hiding inside of this jungle, they are asleep
I think that it's time that we find and invite these animals to a feast
They tummies are hungry, they hold me, they know me, but what do I have to eat?
Well it's something so sick and the wickedest, bet you this shit'll give you the creeps
The horrorcore king, you don't believe
Knock on your door, kill everything
Wife on the floor, bitch don't you scream
You know you want more, give me your spleen
Now watch me eat it, shit it, and pee it, eat it again
You seen it, even thinking bout puking, dryheaving
He can't believe it, he bout to see it again

[Hook](X2)
Sing for the dead
Sing for the dead!
Now wake em up
Raise em up!

[Verse 2]
Now whether your smoking, or whether your drinking
Arms are broken, severed and bleeding
You stay martian, at all costs and if you shall fall in They stuck with ya'll winning
You don't ever see another night and day, just know you'll die rocking
Thats the only way, for a juggalo to know
Raise your horns up, even if your dead, face ripped and torn up
Jump out your brains and catch the horrorshow
King Gordy's on he's testing to grow
With Strange and Psychopathic rolled into one
Keep telling Potluck to roll another one
One Ton, Suburban Noize heard ya boy
They love me
The rockstar life is lovely
To all my kids that keep their hair braided, drug related and they faces painted
Yo!

[Hook](X2)

[Verse 3]
Your filled up with hate, no one can relate, you live in eternal hell
Can't wait til you waste, your family's fate, they grin only for themselves
Your funeral's boring, now they are snoring, only time will tell
When my soul will leave, so I can see King Gordy rocking well
I'll cheer and I'll scream, jump off the stage
Sing all the songs, I'm in a daze
Hitting the bong, blunts to blaze
Watch him go hard, look at his face
He entertains, he is Cobain
He is insane, he is in space
Out of this galaxy Gordy straight laughing and actually man he's a natural catastrophe

[Hook]
