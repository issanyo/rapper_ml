Ladies and Gentlemen
Live from the Grammy's in South Africa
We've got Bizarre
Is he ready? He's ready
The fat black is back!

You ain't got to like my body
For us to dance
Baby I just came to party
Give me a chance
You ain't got to like my body
For us to dance
Baby I just came to party
Give me a chance

King Gordy:
'Cause he's a fat boy
But he's moving like Beyonce
Fat Boy and he's dagging since the nigga wave

Bizzare
I'm in the American Idle
Looking for parlor
Kill the dance floor
So I'm a baller
Still gangsta with the stars
'Cos ain't nobody better than Bizarre
I got the reason to choose who the design stave is
Moon walking bobbing and weasing
I'm big guy that the girls like
Cute baby face
I get more like
I used to be dancing for hammer
In the 80's defiently
Girl I got all the ladies
Thanks Mr. Walling
Ain't no spolling
Don't you know who Bizarre is?
Ooh yeeah!
Everywhere I go
I get attention
Little microshorts surrounded by tension
Kissing off sissing and the girls love it
Come over here and rub on my stomach
Hook
I'm at the MTV awards ready to jam
Little showercap they know who I am
I see Deborah Cox run up in her spot
Walk up to her and start doing the waa
The way I dance ...
Doing macaroni with two of my friends
Ten seconds I'mma put in word
(Oh CD about to take off his shirt)
Look at my muscles they're so amazing
I can see you and your girlfriend gazing
I'mma kill the dancefloor and shake the earth
We call this dance the German Smurf
So black, white or european
This is the ...

'Cause he's a fat boy
But he's moving like Beyonce
Fat Boy and he's dagging since the nigga wave
Fat boy
But he's moving like Beyonce
Fat Boy and he's dagging since the nigga wave
