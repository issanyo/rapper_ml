[Verse 1]
Not you just brought this ass whoopin on yourself, y'all
Rockin the shit outta his left jaw
This is my best brawl
Trynna tear his head off
We in the slums beefin
Walk in around in a circle than come to swingin
Now his gums is bleedin
Niggas breathin heavy
Aimin for his fuckin eyes trynna leave it swellin
Two niggas mean and sweaty
And we gettin it on
Combination of fists is thrown
Switchin blows
To hit up down at his toes
My shit is black and his blue. Puttin in ransom in moves
Had him in a head lock, shit, even tackled him too
I'm intending on winning, cause bitch I'm badder than you
Kickin flows while I'm fightin, bitch I'm still battlin you
And I'll hit you with punch lines
Well I'll punch his lights out
And I suggest you not start
To try shit with this large
Nigga who got them braids stickin up. E, we will stick you up
Stated out as a battle, but ended with you gettin punched

[Verse 2]
(Hey King Gordy, niggas off they better end fuckin with yo brother
They told him fuck you and your mother, I think they finna jump him.)
What? Now we ten deep in the Monte Carlo
Flyin up Van Dyke. Drivin faster than the car can go
Now usually I don't do this
I'm 23 - finna go fuck up some high school kids
Now we in front of the gate. Oh what a wonderful day
Hopin right out just as my brother gets punched in the face
Oh, but the odds ain't even. Oh they fourteen deepn
But when my squad get to swingin the entourage started creeping
Leaving they homies and they best friends to get they ass beat
Laid off, out in the street
And now it's down to one. Stomp the shit outta him
Do not stop kickin him. Keep hittin him until the cops come
I don't give a fuck. A victim to the streets or the microphone
Students, bitches, MCs, you'll all get fired on!

[Interlude]
Bitch... What's up then bitch? Bitch ass nigga. What? Bitch ass nigga
Bitch. Bitch. (Ohh) Bitch. Bitch. (Ohh... I'm gonna get my gun!)

[Verse 3]
Oh since we wooped your ass you wanna get mad and grab the mag and blast?
Stop that, you ain't ready for combat
These hollows hotter than lava, she borrowin your binoculars
Knockin you out your socks and your ass into a coffin, son
You don't want no hood beef, we ain't wit it
Shouldn'ta gave hard looks at me a mean grins
But you had to take it to that other
Now your face is fucked up
Bustin 'Ks at your mother, put a gauge to your brother
I ain't sympathetic; nigga fuck your homies, I ain't sweatin it
I got turrets that will get them wet in less than 7 seconds
You don't need it from us
You should just be glad beef ain't from us
But you bringin beef, so what up? You and your peeps'll get fucked up
You'll get your crazy ass nuckled, go catch your brother
Got bullets for each one of ya
Your mother just had ya cousin
The only family man, blastin all of ya kin
Smacked up all of ya friends, hell naw there ain't no end
THIS IS BEEF NIGGA!
