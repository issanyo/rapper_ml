[Intro: Adolf Hitler]
"Und wieder werden die Menschen kommen und gehen, und stets aufs neue ergriffen, begl√ºckt und begeistert sein, denn die Idee und die Bewegung sind lebend Ausdruck unseres Volkes und damit ein Symbol des Ewigen. Es lebe die nationalsozialistische Bewegung, es lebe Deutschland!"

[Verse 1: King Gordy]
Have you ever in your life seen something so evil?
Tongue kissing your wife right here in this cathedral
The darkness shall rise, the sky's starting to bleed through
The sweet Jesus is dying now read this bible we wrote
But our version is different, it involves murder and sinning
With God being the victim and Lord Lucifer winning
The beginning indeed. The snake manipulates Eve
To give the Adam the apple. For seven days you shall bleed
Out of your womb. You'll be consumed, as terror glooms, and I assume
I'll be in rooms full of gold, they'll bury me in the tombs
Then I'll be resurrected, in less than seven seconds
I will not accept the presence of God to me he's just an effing peasant
So I'll give you this present. It's a gift and a blessing
Instead of resting in heaven give your flesh to a legend
To Mars and Mercury and since God em-birthed me
Allah can't hurt me. I am the God they call...
They call me Xerxes! My God, my God. Oh they call me Xerxes! My God, my God. They call me Xerxes! My God, my God. For I am a God-king!
