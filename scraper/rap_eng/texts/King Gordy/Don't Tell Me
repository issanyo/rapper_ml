You always on the sideline wit guide lines
Never to help me, but to hate mine
When i pull up baby, its game time
I'm bringing the heat, now that's a flame rhyme
They've been saying we doin it the wrong way
Fuck what dem all say
I wasn't sellin back then, and I ain't sellin today
I got the family reppin for me, we done come a long way
To listen to anybody tell us we didn't innovate
A different kind of music happens
But the ones that feel a little bit different can be an outcast like Andre
Imma big boy with this strong jay
I'm underground like a dead body

Hook: ×2 (Madrox)
If you tryna tell me, please don't waste your time, I never listen, I'm
Too busy with my hands in the air, I'm feelin dizzy, I'm
Not tryna hear anything you sayin, turn the music up
Let the track bump, let the track bump

(King Gordy)
Yeah, uh
Heres a picture with your little sister getting fingered
Entered in the center of her clitoris and then disfigured
Hit her with a clip, and kill her, flip her in the river
In the middle of the winter
Send her on a chilly mission
Bodies frozen, I'm hopin cops and boats will find her
Floatin, I suppose that's shes decomposin and probably smokin hot
Sorry the bitch cold, this shits bold
Me and Twiztid still interested in digging in her hole
Minds militant, rhymes ignorant villain with no soul
Find villages, I'll pillage it, sittin on a throne
I'm a ninja made of magic, monoxide its on
Tell Jamie if they say his name again, bitch I'm clapping chrome
I'm the new gutter, it's the new summer of sam
Look on the news cover, calling me silence of the lambs
Mixed with the blues brother, show my true color
Cut the horns off, still more evil than Lucifer

Look at the blood line, and you see I ain't playin
Listen a lil bit closer and you'll hear what I'm sayin
That we ain't goin nowhere, this just another evolution
When the whole scene was ready for another revolution
And we shakin it up
Why they shakin like a seizure
They keep bumpin out shit, while we bumpin out the speaker
And we deep and beneath ya, when we spitting like walls while we walkin on water
They all swimmin for the life boats

(madrox)
Don't tell me when I succeed, im nothing more than a sellout
They ain't tellin me keep it real to the ass and reality fellout
Don't tell me to never change, imma season inside a fitting room
Trying on whatever makes me happy, to find a better mood
Don't tell me to choose, im finicky and hard to please right
Don't tell me how to act, how to look, or who to be like
Don't tell me tell me wait for tomorrow cuz im livin it today
They can try to tell me, but I'd​ never   listen anyway
