(Intro: Bizarre)
LARS!
Hey little kids, do not grow up trying to be like us. Because the shit that we do, it's not cool

(Verse 1: Bizarre)
I got a problem with sleeping
My wife's a whore, she got a problem with cheating (whore!)
I'm a fucking drug addict, stop for two weeks and then get right back at it
The percs and the oxies, the weed, a whole lot of broccoli
Sorry to all my fans, I do two songs and then leave in a van
This white kid been in line for six hours, spit in his face and then yelled "Black power!"
Fuck that, I need a meeting
Where the cops at? I need a beating
Weirdo, yeah I'm a zero
Richard Simmons, my new fucking hero
Psyche, I'm lying
These perkies got me flying

(Hook: Foul Mouth)
A pocket full of dope got me acting right
I'm like ten minutes away from the after life
I'm a loser for destruction with an appetite
The Last American Rock Stars bitch, savage life

(Verse 2: King Gordy)
This is horseshit
Knock on your door and get your foreign bitch
Torn and ripped, turned into a corpse and force with four inch dicks
Where her oral is, boy is this
Some disturbing, sick scurvy, sin worthy, sin thirty, men hurry
And get it in. Bury her body, we like to party
La di da di, the side of me got her hollering in lobbies
Well obviously, me and Bizarre kind of an oddity
Psychologically, we are out of our fucking noggins
We are rock and roll legends, losers as you expected
Cause we wreckless, doing meth on the steps of the Texas sheriff's
And blow smoke all in their face, tell them to eat us like some breakfast
Get arrested and confessed that I'm a weapon and they hate me
And they spray me and they taze me in the chest and now I'm following directions
But not really, hog and spit on his vest and I'm a motherfucking rockstar
Pass the coke, the new black Axl Rose
King Gordy!

(Hook: Foul Mouth)
A pocket full of dope got me acting right
I'm like ten minutes away from the after life
I'm a loser for destruction with an appetite
The Last American Rock Stars bitch, savage life
