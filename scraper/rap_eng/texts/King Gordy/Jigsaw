[Verse 1]
I wanna play a game, you got 60 seconds to get naked
Get an erection and inject yourself with a deadly infection
And the antidote is kept inside your bitchâ€™s fake breast
Time is runnin out, put it in your mouth and rip her fuckin flesh
Till nothing's left, left her titty such a fuckin mess
Yes, I achieved the serum, but there's also a cassette
It's giving me more instructions, I'm sufferin, now I'm runnin
I'm runnin to a room and saw a stomach in a pool of blood
What is this? How did I end up in this?
I was in the crib eatin lunch and shit, my girl was about to suck my dick
Then I feel a pinch of the needle with some drugs in it
Blacked out, woke up with five another people cuffed and shit
In a TV box is a doll, tells us what to get and do to get out this problem
Now we're working up and sweatin
Two people just died in front of me, please
I hope this is a joke, just somebody fuckin with me

[Hook]
I'mma make em scream torture, bloody murder
I came to eat your brains
I got a couple tools for ya, to hurt ya
I came to bring the pain
I'mma make em scream torture, bloody murder
I came to eat your brains, oh
I'm the realest motherfucker when I spit raw
Got something up, but he's called Jigsaw

[Verse 2]
The door is closed, you're in rooms, open stories, open wounds
On the floor, you are doomed, what's in store, I assume
Something more out of loop, tryin to plan an escape
All those leads are misleading, I'm trapped in this place
Can't breathe, my knees bleedin, a slap in the face
When I need to keep thinkin, get back in the race
To achieve the freedom
Even if it means takin a member of my team and eat him
His meat will be in fajitas to feed us
You're looking at a desperate man with a severed hand
Watched every damn body died, please tell me
When this shit is over, 20 seconds left, now I'm getting sober
Realize I wanna live, now I'm listening to his orders
Gotta fuck myself up, just to get out of this shit
I cut my whole dick off, just to get out of this quick
What am I saying, see there's no one here to save me
I've put myself in this game, I'm the only one playin'

[Hook]
