[Verse 1]
I was once a pretty angel, I once stood by you
I always did good by you
My wings were whiter than snow, you loved me so
But when I started a war, you banished my soul
You could never be your One, I was jealous of your son
I broke my halo, my horns have begun
To grow out of my head
Thy will has been done
In here I am God, but I miss my Father

[Hook]
Please just let me live again (I miss my Father)
I promise I will never sin (I miss my Father)
Please let me awake again (I miss my Father)
I'll praise You till the very end (I miss my Father)

[Verse 2]
Brimstone is what surrounds me now
Demons making awful sounds
This ain't the place to go
Why can't I go back home?
Instead, hell, I guess I'll roam
I made the bed I must lie on
The prettiest angel heaven knows
In here I am God, but I miss my Father

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Please, God, forgive me for my sins
I wish I was by your side again
Before the world comes to an end
I wanna look into Your eyes again
Please, God, forgive me for my sins
I wish I was by your side again
Before the world comes to an end
In here I am God, but I miss my Father

[Hook]
