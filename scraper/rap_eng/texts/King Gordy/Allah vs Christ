[Verse 1]
There's a Shepard and a lamb in a manger
The lamb is in danger
For angels told the stranger that it needs the blood from it
He does love it but God said cut it
So fuck it the Shepard guts and hits the stomach
Wipes the blood on the front of his forehead he's anointed
Appointed as a soldier for God, who's dissapointed?
Well Allah is he's sick of Jesus
Both of them Middle Eastern
Hope they can get to speaking but no one would give a reason
While there is tension between Muslim and the Christian
This is funny cause Lucifer also uses this against them
To win souls cause them folks change when the wind blows
Repent full sins or replace where you've been
On your knees you're chin's on the holy carpet
Ass up you done started Muhammad Islamic
Now you fast for weeks, bring to the East
Maybe if we see the Arab in the mighty Jew
Fight to death praise me

[Hook]
Allah is a God
Strap on, strap on bombs and die for him
Jesus dies for all
On crosses, crosses crucified for men
Allah versus Christ

[Verse 2]
Yo, if it means dying upset to travel
Blessed to see epic battles
Request to be in their actual face
As legends capture moments so holy
Only these opponents cause commotions
That stir in oceans and planets and solars
That's over a hundred of millions of light years, yes I am right here
Lightning don't strike fear cause lightning is like spears
Aimed at the heart of the Gods been fighting for nine years strait
No breaks sometimes so violent I cry tears
But this was meant to happen in the scriptures but with different matches
Satan was supposed to be in action, he's the champion
Each time that Jesus is hit, it's like a fetus been ripped
Right out of a women's womb, the bleeding's intense
One of our lords are doomed, what's the real meaning of this
He grabs the sun picks up the moon, yes the beatings begin
So much suffering I can't believe
Was 13 when I first seen it now I'm 83

[Hook]

[Outro]
Congregation, don't you ever let someone tell you that Jesus did not die for you and your sins. That you are not washed in the blood of the lamb. That you are God's children. For God thought of the world that he gave his only begotten son. For whoever believed in him, Jesus
