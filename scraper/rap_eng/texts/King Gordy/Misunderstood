[Verse 1]
I used to spit with intentions of being Biggie
Chris Wallace get dollars, try to become the king of my city really
I'm at the lush lounge trying to score a touchdown
The only guy with horns in his head, with sexual sound
They call him Cobain, he claims to be a rock star
He speaks the ways of the wicked and plus he's not far from making a million
He's sound with some Jews but on his way to the building they're like wait just a minute
Gordy I know you're focused here
But we're going to have to reschedule for a pedestal, the great white hope is here
If this continued for five years, I cry tears
Know that I rhyme fears so shit why am I here
Fuck it, I guess I'll make the best of it with no budget
Put out King of Horrorcore and get the judgement, but fuck them
Suck a dick, welp, I ain't got no love for you hoes
I rather have a million Juggalos than one of you hoes

[Hook]
You really think I'm crazy
'cause I talk about things that's crazy
But I'm here to show you it ain't be the way that they raise me was crazy
You really think I'm crazy
'cause I talk about things that's crazy
But I'm here to show you it ain't be the way that they raise me was crazy

[Verse 2]
They say I make the type of music for you people to kill to
They take your lives and using you, you teach 'em to kill too
Tell them to hurt their parents then sell 'em a shirt and swear it's all entertainment
They just swearing my verse is scaring 'em
Now just get your paint and apply it on your faces
Supply the world with hatred, a bipolar patient
I try going straight and guess it wasn't for me, stress it coming shortly
The rest is fucking corny, you're the best, we love you Gordy!
Thank you, I'm glad the underground loves my sound
Coming from the ground zero and my heros discovered the sound
I am the wicked shit, horrorcore, insanity
Never painted my face but still considered family
Catch me at the gathering, bet you I might have some weed
From California sitting caddy-corner back against some trees
Feel the breeze, the mainstream said fuck me though
I'd rather have a million Juggalos than one of you hoes

[Hook]
You really think I'm crazy
'cause I talk about things that's crazy
But I'm here to show you it ain't be the way that they raise me was crazy
You really think I'm crazy
'cause I talk about things that's crazy
But I'm here to show you it ain't be the way that they raise me was crazy
