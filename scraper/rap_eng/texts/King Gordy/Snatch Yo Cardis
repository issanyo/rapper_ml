[Intro: Bizarre]
I'm from Detroit, Michigan
Murder capital of the world
And there's one thing
That we'll kill a nigga for
Is your motherfucking Cartier glasses
Yeah nigga
I need those

[Hook: Bizarre and King Gordy]
Snatch his Carties off his face
Snatch his Carties off his face
Snatch his Carties off
Oooh, I need 'em bro

Snatch his Carties off his face
Snatch his Carties off his face
Snatch his Carties off
I got's to have 'em my guy

Snatch his Carties off his face
Snatch his Carties off his face
Snatch his Carties off
Fuck driving all the way up to Somerset

Snatch his Carties off his face
Snatch his Carties off his face
Snatch his Carties off
Bitch gimme those glasses!

[Verse 1: Bizarre]
Saturday night
Man it's time to party
I ain't come to dance I came to snatch some Carties
When we in Belle Isle, fifty nigga's deep
Fifty pairs of glasses, we snatch in a week
I'm from Seven Mile
We do this when we bored
Why buy a pair of Carties
When I can snatch yours
Bite off your face
With a loaded pistol
You can try to run
But believe we gon' get you
Rollin' through your hood
Lookin' for the wood
Five deep in the cut
Up to no good
And I can take those buffies
Right off your face
'Cos I'm out h
Out here
Like Dusty McFly

[Hook: Bizarre and King Gordy]

[Verse 2: Calico]
First of all, sit still
Stop making it a big deal
Don't you know you can get killed
Let me see if them shit's real
Soon as I see a nigga rockin' 'em
I'm sockin' 'em
(And if I peep a rainbow tenner???)
I'm poppin' 'em
Now that's for wastin' time
Nigga when we take your shine
I ain't even gotta rush 'em off
I take my time
I leave niggas with two options
The basic kind
Give up the glasses, or run
And take this 9'
See now that's up to you
Once you see what I'm clutchin' dude
Better answer yo' man and give 'em up
Or he's stuck with you
It ain't my fault
It's just that Detroit lifestyle
Bizarre, shit I'm 'bout to go and snatch some right now

[Hook: Bizarre & King Gordy]

[Verse 3: King Gordy]
I heard you got that
Cartier eyewear with diamonds in 'em
I swear that I'mma get 'em
I dare you find a victim
And hit 'em
And get the lenses
I'll flip 'em
With the extended clip
Lift 'em and the shit's intended to kill 'em
If I offend 'em, I meant it
And I'mma fill 'em with talons off of these glasses
Assassins
Hit 'em with bats and attack 'em
I gotta have 'em' 'ay
Boy I'm off of that Van Dyke
East Side, we gon' rock that hood
With that West Side I wear like
White buffies, it's all good
Throw up off of that icy chain
I'm up off of that nice ass vain
Break that body, now I take your Carties
Now I'm in the party
With yo nice ass Range
Hit a little bit
Trick a little bitch
Get a little bitch
With the dick all in her face
Stick it in the clit'
Lick and hit it quick
Fool like a pimp
Kept on my Cartier

[Hook: Bizarre & King Gordy]
