[Verse 1: King Gordy]
I'm sick of being broke as fuck every damn day
I wish that we could open up when a band plays
Perform our hearts out, maybe get us a fan base
You can love me in either a good or a bad way
When I run out of rhymes that'd be a sad day
My life moves at a fast pace like a drag race
Sometimes I think in this industry they don't have space
For someone that is unique as me, I just had to say
See I speak freely, sometimes it leaves a bad taste
In the mouths of these corporate people who have say
Of who should be signed or not, it's a damn shame
I wanna have fame, give a girl my last name
How many of us hoping to get in this rap game?
So they can take care of they people when they chance came
This for my artists that do it like it's the last thing
They'll ever do in their lives, now I am asking

[Chorus: King Gordy, (Monica Blaire)]
Are you ready for a million fans? (Million fans)
Girls scream when they touch your hands (Touch hands)
You done traveled all across the land
But you still don't understand (This is a gift)
Are you ready for a million fans? (Million fans)
Girls scream when they touch your hands (Touch hands)
You done traveled all across the land
But you still don't understand (This is a curse)

[Verse 2: King Gordy]
Life ain't so easy, is it? Might seem exquisite
Excited by TV images
Projecting all these false idols, we lost lives too
Over a war of words, Biggy and Pac died too
All you want is people to recognize you
Feed your family, tour the world, till the next time you
Drop an album, but see now you riding in Phantoms
You had a number one hit, something you couldn't fathom
In over a million years, you've got a million peers
That get a million chill bumps when they hear your shit pump
You're on the cover of every magazine now
You are a star, you've been put inside a machine now
You are a sophomore, when will the jitters begin
You ain't broke no more, does the hunger still live within?
Will your beats be a little slower or faster or
Will they demand your single sounds like your last one?

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: King Gordy]
This time around, will you do as well as they're expecting?
Or will your loyal fans close their ears and reject it
You were highly respected, had fire on your last record
Nominated for Grammys, you wasn't half steppin'
I hope you were taught a very valuable life lesson
Ah baby don't stress it, diamonds are made from pressure
I hope this gives you pleasure instead of causing depression
They're applauding, you're next up, step up
They're out of their seats, didn't have to tell em to get up
You charted this weekâ€‹, you're number one, the pressures letting up
Your 15 seconds continue to tick on
A mega celebrity but inside something's wrong
He's never home, he's unhappy, he loves his family
His kids love they daddy, his girl's fussing at him
Plus you're tryna get your group on that you came up with
So now you know what the price of fame will come with

[Chorus]
