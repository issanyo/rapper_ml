[Verse 1]
Some people wonder why I even do this wicked shit
I ain't signed to Psychopathic, and Strange don't give a shit
It's cause I'm so belligerent, lyrics I spit is ignorant
Some Juggalos get the hit, and others wanna get a brick
And throw em at me while Im performing, they say Im boring
They warn me that I'm corny with horns, fuck you Gordy
Some applaud me, they call me ungodly and even follow me
They offer me their life, sacrifice it like its a prophecy
But obviously, what's been haunting me is the block you see
They're not into the shock, you need to stop and talk about the streets
You're from Van Dyke and Harper, god dammit
Remember this, that's where you inherited all your talents
The East side was behind you, see you were their king
Till you started dressing Gothic and trying to be seen
Put them two braids up, rapping crazy as fuck
You could have been the greatest as ever but you fucked it all up
And now it's

[Chorus]
(Over)
I don't like how it feels to be sober
Sometimes it makes me feel like its over
See, I got the whole world on my shoulders
I wish that somebody else would come hold it
But then I get the strength of a soldier
I promise it'll never be over
And now I got the power to move boulders
I promise this will never be over
Never

[Verse 2]
Well, the Fat Killahz are stronger but getting older
As artists, brother Marvin has a slight chip on his shoulder
And I feel him, plus Fatt father now has two children
And Bang's married, and I'm in the streets just tryna make a million
This isn't how it's meant to be, you see, The Entity
Was supposed to put me and my three homies on a winning streak
I even told Marshall I'd rather be in the industry
As a group member, that's how much my niggas meant to me
I wish the whole would could see what we have to offer
MarvWon, Gordy, BangO, and Fatt Father
We should have been a fucking household name
With nice gold chains, tryna gain Run DMC fame
The largest group in America, world famous
I'm taking full blame for it, maybe if I had made some changes
To my album this wouldn't have happened, and we went platinum
Don't worry about it, the Fatt Killahz are back in action
It ain't

[Chorus]
