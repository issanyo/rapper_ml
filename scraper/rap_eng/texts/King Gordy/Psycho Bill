[Verse 1: King Gordy]
Welcome to the forest of northern Michigan
Off in a cabin in the back a families living in
The daddies happy to be back he's been in prison since
O Billy Jack came out his sack but now the kid is 10
But the father can't believe what he's seeing
See Billy is deformed so he treats him like a thing
Not from this earth blames God been cursed
Sincehis birth gets worse
Punches on the wall until his fist hurts
His daddy don't love him and his own mother is scared of him
So he just said fuck em and cut em and then fucked them
Now billy jack is running through the woods
With his parents blood on his hands feeling fucking good
To be free
But now Billy's thirst has increased
So he lurks by a church
Goes berserk on a priest
And he searching for teenagers who's camping out
He's only working with three razors he's blacking out

[Chorus: King Gordy]
Somewhere out there in that forest
Lives a creature who eats the corpses
Of all his victims he beats and tortures
At will this is the legend of psycho bill
This is the legend of psycho bill
This is the legend of psycho bill

[Verse 2: Bizarre]
Psycho bill I live in the forest
I'm the one Darth Vader was talking about in the chorus
You can't see me but I can see you bpoo!
Turn your ass into rabbit stew
Bitch this is what the fuck that's going to happen
You bring your ass in the woods talking about you camping
Now you best friend went fishing
Six day Manhunt they done came up missing
If I tell you what happened to Johnny
I might end up in prison
Damn that's a tough ass decision
Fuck it I might as well confess
I cut his body up a made a pink and blue dress
And his best friend I made suffer
Cut his dick off and made him my new gay lover
Psycho Bill a Kid misunderstood
If you don't want to get killed stay the fuck out the woods

[Chorus: King Gordy]
