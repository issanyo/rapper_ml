To whom this may concern
There's so many bridges to burn
It seems you'll never learn
There's so many bridges to burn
The paths you've sacrificed
No more bridges to burn
It's such a lonely life
No more bridges to burn
No more bridges to burn
There's so many bridges to burn
No more bridges to burn
There's so many bridges to burn

[Verse 1]
On this surf you're roaming hopeless
You are a derelict homeless
You've forgotten where home is
You manipulate for mere change
You pressure them
And if they do not donate you say God bless 'em
Hangs at your local grocery store or gas station
He looks overly poor but keeps the damn drink in his hand
Many may feel sorry for this man who stands with a sign in his hand
He's trying again to play with your precious emotions
Make you feel guilty
You wonder why he is begging
You wonder why he's filthy
A stroke of bad luck, God dealt him a bad hand
So he resorted to drinking?
Help me understand!
I'm curious, maybe he just wasn't good enough
At anything he attempted or couldn't be because
Karma's a real bitch, that's it
Guess I'll believe that every path he's had is now ashes
His bridges have burned

[Verse 2]
The most popular prettiest girl in the school
She'll be a scholar
But very naive, easy to leave, cause she's a follower
Friends are very promiscuous
Her mother says they all are sluts
But she takes up for them
She insists that they are not what people make them out to be
She hates it when her mom shouts so she storms out the house and leaves
Getting calls from all of her uncle and aunties
Telling her to stay focused and please watch the company you keep
She hangs up in their faces it means nothing 'cause she's convinced her friends she hangs with are the greatest
They offer her alcohol and pills to take
With these two joints these two boys have just laced
With something that's making her feel absolutely amazing
Now she's naked being videotaped and played with
She's impregnated, mom couldn't take it
No one to stay with, her friends turned to strangers
Her bridges were burned

[Verse 3]
Do onto others as you want others to do onto you
Or watch your bridge collapse right from under you
Times are bad, you're sad, no one will comfort you
Disowned by family members you're used to running to
Very much alive but inside you're lifeless
You've realized family ties is priceless
You've seen the light but your bridge has ignited
Engulfed in flames he's unable to fight it
It is such a shame that we are so blinded
We will decline to hear things that's righteous
You will only press their buttons
So inside they're blowing up
They're headed for self-destruction
I have no words of wisdom
I observe from a distance
I watch 'em burn their bridges being hurtful and wicked
Eventually I hope you come to your senses
No human should ever have to be alone and senseless
Rebuild your bridges
