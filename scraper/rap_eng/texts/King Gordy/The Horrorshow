I welcome you to a room full of blood and intestines
Love and rejection
Son I'm a reverend
Yelling there is no heaven and little Helen
Is gonna suck Kevin's dick, she is eleven
Kevin is thirty-seven, molesting Helen until she wets the bed
Now get ready for the beheading
Then I'll head west and shave my face and chest and head and hope that nobody notice me
Hopefully John Walsh is a dead man
Wanted by America
Hungry and I'm scared as fuck
Hit a rural area, find a family and bury em
But the daughter got away, you know what this could mean
Finally, chase a white blond bitch through the wood scene
Like yes, you can lace up your left boot and let's scoot
Your so cute and yet foolish, every move accepts useless
You know your gonna fall
Why even try at all?
Take her back to the cabin and eat her ass until it's gone

Hey what up Juggalo?
Welcome to the horrorshow!
You say you got some kush to roll?
Well welcome to the horrorshow!
You say your girlfriend's a ho?
Well bring her nasty ass down to the horrorshow!
You said you never heard of King Gordy before?
Just buy you a ticket to the horrorshow!

I'm an anomaly, obviously probably involved in sodomy
So logically I'm a be all that I can be aside of the assholes
I pray they'll pack your ass with some glass yo
Your girl want us to fuck her fast though, with masks on
Holding a whip, blowing her shit out til we swolling her lips
Controlling her hips, nose broken and both of her ribs open
We keep stroking, her hole is so soaking, wet
I bet I broke it from Hoboken to Oakland
I'm joking, I only want to cut her throat open
Then throw her off a boat and watch her float in the ocean
Murder or Rape?
Burger or steak?
You take the pick
Burn up your face
Turn into Jason and shake a bitch
Coming live from Camp Crystal Lake, we'll catch, kill, fillet
Your cap's peeled today but I feel okay
I've been shot a million times, thank God I'm still alive, disfigured but the mask conceals my face

Hey what up Juggalo?
Welcome to the horrorshow!
You say you got some kush to roll?
Well welcome to the horrorshow!
You say your girlfriend's a ho?
Well bring her nasty ass down to the horrorshow!

I'm an armed assassin, the last card's to crash em
I am causing panic, my flying saucer landed
Right in the Midwest and yes I guess I am standing right on this kid's chest, til this bitch is near death
I'm a have a great night at this cabaret right?
Til I got in eight fights then I got my face sliced
So I'm shooting up this cabaret twice
This Saturday's quite violent, got to wiling on these fagot made dikes
I ain't lying, got to firing, let the magnum play dice
Gamble with your life, bullet will have em laying right
In the middle of Van Dyke, this ain't no scary movie
No hockey mask or knives, bitch we carry Uzi's
And there is no sequel, just blood on your clean clothes
But no sneakers on, sorry my nigga but we keep those
Shit he's froze, what's he need some shoes on his feet for?
Now bring on Gordy with this gory ass king show

Hey what up Juggalo?
Welcome to the horrorshow!
You say you got some kush to roll?
Well welcome to the horrorshow!
You say your girlfriend's a ho?
Well bring her nasty ass down to the horrorshow!

We want the horror!
