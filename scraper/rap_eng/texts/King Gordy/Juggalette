[Verse 1]
Well how ya doing Mrs. Juggalette
Face Painted
Lookin' all sexy with that hatchet tatted on your breast
You are my morbid thing
My horrorcore queen
My wicked witch of the Midwest
My east coast mistress
My down south, thick breast Juggalette
But when I'm out west I love to rub against yo ass
You are so gothic
My dick is getting hard
I can't stop it
Baby, you are the hottest
They say you always making songs for them Juggalos
What about us pretty girls in the front row
King Gordy you on fire we can smell smoke
Baby, I keep the fire just inhale slow
Now when we get to the hotel room
I assume we'll be eating these mushrooms, then I'll be fucking you
You say you got a boyfriend, we'll give him something to do
Stand outside, watch my truck and don't move

[Chorus]
You say I ain't the best
All you do is talk about me
And I ain't even famous yet
But your girlfriend still gonna jock me
Don't get mad cuz your Juggalette
Knows each and every song that I sing
I am a star that's why your girl is in my car
And she's giving me head

[Verse 2]
I've never had this type of love before
After this, I shall love no more
Let her on stage
Come on baby dance with me
Wiggle that ass for me
Wait in the back for me
I'll be on my way to show ya something
And when the show is over
Oh yes we gonna be fucking
My name is Cobain
I don't care if you got man
I'm a rockstar, pretty sure dude will understand
But if not security will put they fuckin' hands on his ass
So fast he won't have a second chance
Now me and you can continue our little romance
This is wickedstock, let Gordy play in your pants
When I'm in Denver Colorado I can hit in advance
Them faygo luvers know all them jugglettes
And damn it feels so good
I've never felt this happy inside
I wanna take a Juggalette as my bride
Will you marry me?

[Chorus]
