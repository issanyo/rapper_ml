[Verse 1]
When The Darkness Falls There Shall Be A Full Moon In The Sky
And I Shall Become A Wolf Loose In The Night
Thirsting For Blood
Cursed To Walk The Earth With A Grudge
Savage Canibal
Half Man Half Animal
I Know You See Me On Dateline
Its Strange Ill Change Into This Thing That Has The Fangs Of A Canine
Indeed A Killa Full Of Disease
You'll Need Some Silver Bullets For Me
My Acts Are Heinous Up In Transylvania
In London I Jus Bit The Fuck Out Of Your Young Son
They're Nothing But Lunch Meat If I Catch Them
But Am I The Hunter Or The Hunted Thats The Question
Villages Have Formed Together To Kill Me
The Silly Shit Ill Be Goin Where Ever They Will Be
And I Dont Give A Fuck What You Say
Humans Are Weak We Use Them For Meat
They're Nothing But Prey

[Hook]
Im So Scared Of The Light
That's Why I Only Come Out At Night
I Love To Howl At The Moon
Keep Your Kids Outta Sight
Or They'll Be Eaten Tonight
I Love To Howl At The Moon

[Verse 2]
Im Sick Of People Callin Me Weird
I Can't Take It The Next Thing That You Will Hear
Is Them Praying
See I Have Bitten For Years
And Lets Face It The World Doesnt Want Me Here
But They Fake It
Giving Me Those Claps And Chears
Like I Was Naked
The Faces Wore Off I See Clear
I Am A Human Being
And What You Seeing Is A Metamorphoses
From This Morbid Kid
I Have Been Forsaken
Please Dont Awake Him
He's The Equivalent Satan
Im Contimplaten
Do You Know Your Facein
I Am Amazin See I Dont Know How To Say This
Im Worse Than Jason
Fuck Home Grow Underground It Is The Safest
Im Here Rip Off Your Faces
Plus Im A Rapist
Do You Know Wut Today Is To Say Your Prayers
Cus I Dont Think That You Gon Be Able
So Say Them Later

[Hook]
