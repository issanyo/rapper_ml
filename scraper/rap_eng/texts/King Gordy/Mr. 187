[Intro]
Satan made this lane, from Hell he came

[Hook]
All I see is murder, murder my mindstate
Preoccupied with homicide, trying to survive in this crime rate
You are listening to a violent felon
So say hi to Mr. Kill yo ass, Mr. 187
Murder, murder my mindstate
Preoccupied with homicide, trying to survive in this crime rate
You are listening to a violent felon
So say hi to Mr. Kill yo ass, Mr. 187

[Verse 1]
I'll break bones to take home what I can’t hold inside of my stomach
Drunk his blood and ate his ankles
Buttfucking a five year old
Put the knife inside her hole then slice her throat
She's been dead for days, I still put new dresses on her
Then spread her legs and lick whatever's left on her
I never met Dahmer
But if I would I would’ve drugged him and fucked him, cooked and served them to Jeff's father
I'm not a maniac dressed in all black
Got on a polo shirt bifocals and some nice dress slacks
Then I'll take some Ex-Lax
Then shit on your chest
This is the best, the smell of death only makes the sex last
You've been in the shower for hours, can't wash off rape though
I hear her holler as hot water hit where I made those
Incisions I vetoed the rope with Mako precision
I hate hoes and women
Now listen now, Mr. 187

[Hook]
All I see is murder, murder my mindstate
Preoccupied with homicide, trying to survive in this crime rate
You are listening to a violent felon
So say hi to Mr. Kill yo ass, Mr. 187
Murder, murder my mindstate
Preoccupied with homicide, trying to survive in this crime rate
You are listening to a violent felon
So say hi to Mr. Kill yo ass, Mr. 187

[Verse 2]
I'm inside of a state prison
Where if you rape women you'll be a rape victim, motherfucker
I decided I hate living
Hey warden, fake this one without the pick and hit that motherfucker
I’m ready for death row, baby let’s go
Either show's labelled on the table
Gettin’ myself poked
With needles, or they'll lead you to a chamber with gas in it
They see that I'm too evil so they hang me my last minute's  dangling
Turnin’ red, death's coming, before it do
I'll speak in the tongues and voodoo, my songs shall go into you
Got the Jigsaw killer tatted on me
I feel him, although he's never killed anyone
It was your decision
Motherfucker, I'm a walking summer vacation that went wrong
Blood all over the cabin, I'm hacking blood on your bitch form
I'm savage, I can't believe period blood is this warm
Ass murder mixed with sick porn, Mr. 187

[Hook]
All I see is murder, murder my mindstate
Preoccupied with homicide, trying to survive in this crime rate
You are listening to a violent felon
So say hi to Mr. Kill yo ass, Mr. 187
Murder, murder my mindstate
Preoccupied with homicide, trying to survive in this crime rate
You are listening to a violent felon
So say hi to Mr. Kill yo ass, Mr. 187
