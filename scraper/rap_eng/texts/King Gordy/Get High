Young Wicked

Something that you should know (should know)
Killa Colorado got that good smoke
I’m riding through my old hood though
Foot up on the peddle and I push slow
Smoking on that Kush so clean
Everyone know that my gang green
Flip it and then we gain green
Michigan do the same thing true
Now what the fuck you wanna do
Fresh crew sounding off like (woof)
And we finna get high

Mr. Grey

Off what he tells you when I roll through
The only thing I chief cannabis cup gold proof
Moonrocks and hot resin in a chopper
So many medical edibles I’m off of my rocker
From dabbing with dirtbag to globbing with jabba
Thai stick on the bus now with the whisky go go go proper
Life is a whore but she fine with me high men
Stoned as a goat in the shadows we be rhyming

Chorus
We about to smoke down down down
Light up and smoke down down down
Whole crew smoke loud down down
If you ain’t with us you can ground ground ground
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiiigh
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiigh
We gonna get high get high get high get high get high
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiigh
Get high with me

Monoxide

Keep smoking and my face numb
Windows down smoking loud like bitch say somethin
Smoke a hundred grams like it ain’t nothin
Too high for the mean mugging bitches you facefuckin
I got a mouthful of space muffins give me a second and I’ll be huntin for martians or a trace of em
Me, Charlie and Dennis we been paint huffin
It’s always sunny when your baked like a cake oven

Madrox

Big pull eyes water like I’m crying
I’m having another attack and tellin myself I’m dying
I eat three edibles and down a fifth of gin
And roll up another joint and smoke it while I take a shit
(I’ll take a hit) ain’t no dookie on my fingers
And I promise if you hold your hit long enough make ya choke until ya vomit
If you’re still half sane after that part of the game
You must get high off lawn clippings Jack I’m just being honest

Chorus
We about to smoke down down down
Light up and smoke down down down
Whole crew smoke loud down down
If you ain’t with us you can ground ground ground
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiiigh
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiigh
We gonna get high get high get high get high get high
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiigh
Get high with me

Blaze Ya Dead Homie

Put the lighter to the joint let’s get lifted
Who wanna get high with me up on my sickness
Smoke getting evicted straight up out the lungs
And then it’s fire in the mosh from the clouds forming above
You might seal me off go ahead could never be ashamed
Straight name Mary jane multiple cuts and strains
Some people get stoned and get right I get formal
Burning like the door to hell is just normal

Bonez Dubb

Know we steady smoking on that good green
Know what I mean got that tree that got you walking with a lean
B. O. N-E-Z with a couple OZ’s
Burning up so much you see the smoke from overseas
I got something to roll I’m a medicate my soul
This shit ain’t no joke I’m a take another toke
Cuz I wanna get so high no lie and that is the motto I live by
And you know I smoke it down

Chorus
We about to smoke down down down
Light up and smoke down down down
Whole crew smoke down down down
If you ain’t with us you can ground ground ground
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiiigh
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiigh
We gonna get high get high get high get high get high
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiigh
Get high with me


Bizzare

I-94 man I’m flying I’m so high I can see Mt. Zion
Gordy smoke backwoods I smoke EZ widers
Ounce of Kush that should be on my rider
Blue dream I done crashed the rental
250 fine I done lost my incidentals
Denver, Colorado the weed’s incredible
Please don’t give me no more edibles

Gordy

Sick in the mind hitting the lime green
Kicking some rhyme schemes
Bitches in line getting their thigh squeezed
Gimmie some kind weed look at my eyes bleed
I’m looking Chinese I am a fiend gimmie some hybreed
I’m feelin hyphy I should proceed
I am just 19 I am a fine being
Alright I’m lying I pull a knife it be a crime scene
I be so high we better put high beams
Nobody driving high speed
Puffing on pine tree nothing but fire weed

Chorus
We about to smoke down down down
Light up and smoke down down down
Whole crew smoke loud down down
If you ain’t with us you can ground ground ground
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiiigh
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiigh
We gonna get high get high get high get high get high
We gonna get hiiiiiiiiiigh
Get high with me

G-Mo Skee

Smoking…..G-Mo……listen
If you tryin to hit these grapes you gotta break bread
And bitch niggas better play dead if they straight edge
I’m in the hood like Wayne head
Smoking on an eighth of something that ain’t clinically safe to take in
Making gravity bongs out of a garbage bin
My lungs blacker than fucking Marvin the Martian’s skin
I’m on a chronic binge when I put a torch to this dab rig
I’ll probably barf again in front of all my friends
