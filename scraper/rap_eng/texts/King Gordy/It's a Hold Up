[Intro]:
L.A.R.S
It's a hold up

[Hook: King Gordy]:
When I run up
This is a hold up
Ain't nothin funny
Stop smiling
Don't nothin better move but the money
Don't nothin better move but the money
Don't nothin better move but the money

[Verse 1: Bizarre]:
I'll verify niggas I terrify niggas
Shoot the hair off yall niggas
Eat the heir of yall niggas
Get him gone, do him wrong, hit him long, get him a palm
Wanted in 20 states
Been on 20 case
Fuck the cops I done shot 20 Daves
Cocaine addict and sniffed 20 plates
Been on 20 dates it's been 20 rapes
Don't know no blood but I ate plenty grapes
Fuck a lot of bitches and smack plenty apes
I'm out here fucking bitches telling them I'm still 28
So what up bitch where's my birthday cake

[Hook: King Gordy]:
When I run up
This is a hold up
Ain't nothin funny
Stop smiling
Don't nothin better move but the money
Don't nothin better move but the money
Don't nothin better move but the money

[Verse 2: King Gordy]:
Sawed off shotgun
Hand on the pump
Cruisin down Van-Dyke passin the blunt
To my goon pretty soon he'll be laughing cause what
Took your money in front of your baby mama nigga what
Pump her ass savages
Degradin shit and damage it
When the can is spit your adams apple it has been split
Ridin up in other niggas projects throwing gang signs
Give a fuck what you claim ima bang mine
Straight eighth nines blaze place breaks fines
You look you shook I shot em on facebook live
This ain't nothing but the east side in the summertime
Cops get behind us hit the corner ima run with mine
My hood tatted on me are art robbers
Drug dealers thug killers can't none of yall stop us
Fuckin call the coppers
Man go get the chopper
Make it seem like an opera
Goin to jail is not an option

[Hook: King Gordy]:
When I run up
This is a hold up
Ain't nothin funny
Stop smiling
Don't nothin better move but the money
Don't nothin better move but the money
Don't nothin better move but the money
