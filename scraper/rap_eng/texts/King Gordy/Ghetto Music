Hey yo, this is your high guy in the sky, flying by
And right now I'm probably on Van Dyke and Harper
Smokin' a long one paper swisher of some fire ass greens
Which is way more important than returning your phone calls
And listening to any messages that you have left me
Please have a fucked up day!

[Bizarre]
Whooo! This is a wonderful day!
The sun is shinin', it's eight-five degrees in Detroit, Michigan! (Yeah!)
The kids is outside playin' (Alright!)
And I'm HAPPY! I'm happy!
Cause I just came from thirty-six Dichan Court!
And I'm a free man! (Alright!)
Now I'm a go to the store, and get me a Bud Lite!
And a fat, bag of weeeed!

Wakin' up lookin' for a bag of herbs! (AAAHHH!)
Smokin', drinkin', all on the curb (Whooo!)
Christmas trees, leany B's, all types of ?
Meds, hydro, even ?mint green?
Shiiiit, I don't rap for weed! (Hahaha!)
Freestyles, hooks - whatever you need (Whatever, dog)
Come to my house we can go to the G-room
Take some shrooms, and look up at the moon! (AAAHHH!)
Kick off your shoes, relax your feet
While I roll some herb and roll up a fat sweet
Cookies and brownies, whatever you wanna eat
Cause you know Bizarre, he be lovin' some sweets!
I smoke so much weed, my pee is green! (Eeeewww!)
Next week, it'd be all clean!
Bizarre's in the back, 84 'Lac
Poppin' some pills listenin' to Fleetwood Mac!

[Hook 2x: King Gordy]
Yes, I wanna get high! (Get high)
And listen to music! (Listen to music)
Some of that good old hip-hop! (Hip-hop)
Straight ghetto music! (Ghetto music)

[Swifty McVay]
HA! I'm from Detroit, bitch, where nothin' is splendid
I'm with niggas that light up trees like the month of December
I'm in the kitchen smilin', cookin' brownies, drownin' Long Island
Allow me to finish this off with a Valium
Now we, physical zombies gettin' in touch with hip hop
And R&B, laughin' at shit around me (Yeah, niggas!)
You overstep your boundaries, I ain't slappin' your hand
You tryna snatch my gan, I'm in casinos slangin' Vicodin
Cloudy, what can you say to niggas that sniff?
More dust than Saudi Arabia and I get rowdy
I'll be smoky as a kettle black
If you ain't Clinton, then you inhalin' that!
So I'mma force you to smoke hella crack!

[Hook 2x: King Gordy]
Yes, I wanna get high! (Get high)
And listen to music! (Listen to music)
Some of that good old hip-hop! (Hip-hop)
Straight ghetto music! (Ghetto music)

[Stic.man]
I love to see the homies cliqued up, fist up
Khakis on sag, bandanna, rags twist up
Hood pry, unified, G's up, ride or die
Livin' by the code of the street, an eye for a eye
Graffiti on the wall, ghetto life
Homies hangin' at the pool hall, out on the block, shootin' dice
Every set of push ups is for my locked up comrads
And for the ones we lost during combat
Pourin' out Cogniac on the concrete
Where the junkies sleep, little kids runnin' the street
My life is full of pain, but it's positive, still
Now that I'm hip to the game, I'm harder to kill
Ghetto waterfalls comin' from the hydros, watch out for the cars, lil homie!
You the cards, lil' homie!
...Yes, you are, lil' homie!
...We all stars, lil' homie!

[Hook 2x: King Gordy]
Yes, I wanna get high! (Get high)
And listen to music! (Listen to music)
Some of that good old hip-hop! (Hip-hop)
Straight ghetto music! (Ghetto music)

[King Gordy]
Some of them old Jay-Z!
Or higher blaze! (Yes!)
Sam Cooke! Some Al Green, Anita Baker
Give me a pound of that
