[Verse 1: The R.O.C.]:
All my life they highly doubted me
Never discredit build my own path few regrets come out of me
Always ran
Just plan my position spittin the sickness
Hitting or missing they concisions ain't strong enough to mention boy
These dudes really know how to push a button
Damn they lovin being up in my business
What was it
Way I did what I wanted to do
You couldn't do it too
So you had to prove hate is all you fucking do
Yeah I'm still spitting though
That's how it was written so
Never will you beat me hoe
Bitch catch my past flow
I don't know no other hoe
Can I be the story scope
Out your dream state
I am the knife
Man you build rope
Your whole team up and delete they self-esteem
Me and the MNE team got a thing for doing max damage to the underground sound so we leading
Who the fuck am I to say
I am the ROC speak

[Hook]:
How'd you get me underground under that late night
You could never ever see my face it's a rave light
Never will I ever let it be safe let the braves fight
I will never fall no walls let me ignite
How'd you get me underground under that late night
You could never ever see my face it's a rave light
Never will I ever let it be safe let the braves fight
I will never fall no walls let me ignite

[Verse 2: King Gordy]:
My mind is racing
But time is wasting
My life is mainly being high and lazy
But my rhymes are fading
I'm trying but failing
Seeing signs
I may be being lied too lately
They like why she play me
Baby why she say things
Reply she hates me
Every time she takes me
On a ride this cake beat can't hide she angry
All the time it makes me grab the nine and blaze three
In her spine then break bread till she die escaping
Is the night I'm crazy and im high please save
From my mind I'm shady and I'm lying just maybe
I reside in Hades burning fire and satan and desire
But wait he's in denial
I'm basically your highness
Brings me a lion and ape
And we can die any day
But ima lie here and wait
This is a dire mistake
I'm spitting right in your face

[Hook]:
How'd you get me underground under that late night
You could never ever see my face it's a rave light
Never will I ever let it be safe let the braves fight
I will never fall no walls let me ignite
How'd you get me underground under that late night
You could never ever see my face it's a rave light
Never will I ever let it be safe let the braves fight
I will never fall no walls let me ignite

[Verse 3: Mr. Grey]:
When I ignite its time to fight
Smack you in the face with a tailpipe
And its bye bye bye or die die die
Eye for an eye
I've learned over time is the only thing that holds this whole world of cold words together
The focus is the bears locked in a safe
Never mistake takes
Serious before you end up in a lake
While we evolve like be evolve
And we pride and resolve
Legendary legacy spit hell at the heresy

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]:
Get it lit
Flames attire then the funeral pyre
Watch life expire
Dressed in a summit attire
Like a bullet in the wire
Big gauge and then rage
Locked up and chasing till myself up out the grave
Bitches still ain't safe
If you get rhyme plated
Like the torches in a raid eviscerate eliminate
They competition is land from where i stand
Cause i took their life up out the motherfuckers with my bare hands

[Hook]:
How'd you get me underground under that late night
You could never ever see my face it's a rave light
Never will I ever let it be safe let the braves fight
I will never fall no walls let me ignite
How'd you get me underground under that late night
You could never ever see my face it's a rave light
Never will I ever let it be safe let the braves fight
I will never fall no walls let me ignite
