[Intro: Mélanie Rutherford]
Standing on top of the ledge
I can hear a sound closer to the edge
No one try to talk me down
My back is against the wind
It’s almost over now but then i see a hand

[Chorus: Mélanie Rutherford]
Why would you catch me
Why don’t you let me go
I’m falling i’m falling
Why would you catch me
No i don’t need your help
I’m sorry but i’m fallen
So don’t try to catch me

[Verse 1: King Gordy]
Hope you don’t really think i’m here to talk you down, do you?
How that sound i’m a clown baby go on do you?
Ain’t that what you told me, tryin to scold me pray to hope that i’ll be lonely only cause you fucked around on me
I had a nervous break down about it, of course i cried ain’t gonna lie bout it
But she’s cryin now it’s too late she thought i was gonna wallow with misery
Till i found me another queen to make us some history
But now here you go callin my phone with harsh threats cause your unhappy love hasn't left our hearts yet
Such a spoiled brat begging for attention
She said she’s been heading for the ledge in a minute
Come be a witness

[Chorus: Mélanie Rutherford]
Why would you catch me
Why don’t you let me go
I’m falling i’m falling
Why would you catch me
No i don’t need your help
I’m sorry but i’m fallen
So don’t try to catch me

[Verse 2: King Gordy]
Whats the reason, Whats the meaning of your actions this evening
Quit acting and leaning and get back here and please. Its not worth it
Your turning this whole thing into a circus
We were never perfect so what you think that I deserve this
Hit the earths service if this makes you feel better don't you get nervous
I guess I never meant nothing now I feel worthless
I thought my love meant something why you wanna hurt us
And why would you consider jumping baby take my hand
See i can’t stand here and watch you land
But this is out of hand girl this was not the plan
You we’re supposed to have a wedding band on your finger now you’re screaming this is getting sad

[Chorus: Mélanie Rutherford]
Why would you catch me
Why don’t you let me go
I’m falling i’m falling
Why would you catch me
No i don’t need your help
I’m sorry but i’m fallen
So don’t try to catch me

[Verse 3: King Gordy]
Baby we’ve been here for five hours straight
No need to contemplate I've already set a date for our big day
I forgive you mommy just come down
I know I said i didn’t care, baby i’m calm now
See I can’t live without you all i do is think about you
I even stand out here with you when we can talk it out boo
No more shouting back and forth I just want to kiss you
Girl your skin is so soft see really missed you
I wanna comfort you just let me get you all the loving you require
So we can continue, our relationship and take a trip
Make this official
I see something in you Put your hand in mine I am jumping with you

[Chorus: Mélanie Rutherford]
Why would you catch me
Why don’t you let me go
I’m falling i’m falling
Why would you catch me
No i don’t need your help
I’m sorry but i’m fallen
So don’t try to catch me

[Outro]
Standing on top of the ledge
I can hear a sound, closer to the edge
No one try to talk me down
My back is against the wind
It’s almost over now but then i see a hand
Why don’t you catch me
