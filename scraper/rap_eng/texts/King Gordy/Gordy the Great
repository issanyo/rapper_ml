[Hook: King Gordy]
Now here's the story of Gordy the great
Loves puffin' blunts, stuffin' food in his face
He takes the road only few would take
You'll probably see him on the news today

[Verse 1: King Gordy]
Well bitch, Gordy's here to crash your cabaret
You're pissed, I don't care, I done had my laugh anyway
I'm here to smoke all your weed cause I downed your liquor
I'm laughing, my family's steamed as soon as I enter
They don't really wanna tell me how they feel, be real
Ma', you don't want me at your crib cause I steal
And dad, you don't want me at your pad
Cause every time she walks past I'm looking at your new wife's ass
My auntie and uncle? They hate my guts too
I hate it has to come to me taking from you
Sorry guy, but I feel you've insulted me
Just for leaving something in front of me
Honor amongst us? Bitch, stop it
Man, I'm tryna pick pocket the man who's pick pocketin'
And for the ladies, I have a magic trick, listen here
Put your purse in my hand, watch it magically disappear

[Hook: King Gordy]

[Verse 2: King Gordy]
What's on today's agenda? I can't remember
Oh yeah, take a swisher, put haze all in it, then blaze and hit it
Okay, I'm back on track now
I drifted away for a minute, came back down
I'm mental, my brain starts itching from these rap styles
Did I mention I'm insane lyrics that wow
A thieve who feels stronger 'bout robbing
Please pardon me while I steal your belongings
From kitchen utensils to kids bicycles
From pennies to nickles I will try to hit you they say
Nothing is worser than a thief
Thou shalt not steal is what many people believe
But I shall not live without anything to eat
Ill steal a hot meal, candied yams, greens, and meat
And a big cup of Kool-Aid to drink
See I'm a broke MC, I don't get paid to think

[Hook: King Gordy]

[Verse 3: King Gordy]
To those I offend, I'm really not sorry for it
Oh you stole before, see, you just call it borrowing'
No matter how you look at it, it seems to me
You've been charged for a crime I like to call thievery
You're in denial, but I'm sure it'll pass
Now you go now with your big bad stealin' ass
It ain't wrong man, you needed that shirt, you needed them pants
Baby girl you need that skirt, you need that cash
You stole from your baby daddy's secret stash
Girl you lookin' good, so what if he beats your ass
Sometimes you just have to take the good with the bad
If you took it, then you crooked, better hope that it lasts
If this becomes a hit, man I'll be so glad
Cause I actually turned hittin' a lick into a fad
And I'll have fans that scream to me with feelin'
(Hey, thats the guy who made a whole song about stealin'
I love you!)
