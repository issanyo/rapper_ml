[Verse 1: King Gordy]
You can try to fight us, you'll collide with lions
I am likely to triumph, despite 9 of us dying
300 of us, 3 million of them
Keep coming, we're fucking them up, we're piercing their skin
Chop their heads off. Tear it off, chew on their limbs
Drink blood for protein and yes we'll do it again
Your king's a coward, don't care what you do with your men
But we are soldier and will die keeping it true til the end
Put me in a arena, give me one sword to defend
Myself against a billion, let the bloody war begin
Then I walk out without any signs of me even being in battle, gladiator
Something you've never seen or could fathom
I'm a general, put inside a pit this shit is pitiful, walking around dead animal
Carcasses cause I slit his throat
You can see I'm heartless a part of this comes with getting thrown into a dungeon
Til I kill Ceasar and get the throne

[Hook: King Gordy & MJ Robinson]
I'm a gladiator!
I am the son of God but they try so hard to enslave me
I'm a gladiator!
They can't stand my blood so they kill my wife and baby
I'm a gladiator!
You can't hold me
I'm a gladiator!
I'm killing this poetry
I'm a gladiator!
I am Maximus, with an axe I'll cut you I'm crazy!

[Verse 2: King Gordy]
I ask myself time and time again, will I die fighting inside of this lion's den
These tyrants like it they can't hide it, they smile and grin
I wish that I could put my knife right inside his chin!
I'm a general not a criminal
Men are getting done critical
Then I'm entering in his room, Ceasar I'm here to get at you
I'll take your life and your crown
Take your wife and your child
Today they're hyping the crowd
They may die in front of thousands
Living legend in your presence
Give em less then fifty seconds
Split your neck then hit ya chest, blood is spit in six directions
Aspire a God-king
Inspired by all things
That's higher than ya'll beings, that's human at offspring
Like Zeus or a crossbreed, an unusual live thing
I'm brutal to the few of you who chose to not drop knees
I'm on top and I won't stop until I conquer the whole continent
The dominant god they call Xerxes!

[Hook: King Gordy & MJ Robinson]

[Verse 3: King Gordy]
The mummy returns with blood in the urn to resurrect me
A God-king is how you will address me
Dress me in golden garments
My flesh bleeds not a drop for I am supersonic
I'm like Mohammed the prophet
Oh Jesus Christ, he's super nice, He's super natural
I'll be a knight and when we fight turn to an animal
I'll swing this knife, as mean as Slice, I'll fucking slash his throat
He needs to die, his meats divided, we are cannibalistic
The Christians insist they're against this
Well send em the head of their messenger, this begins it
Holy war, golden swords, broken jaws, swollen open scars
Soldiers we are warriors, we go for ours
We're to control the whole world by early tomorrow
A man infatuated by a nation calling him God
I'm here to rule the whole universe
I will have you and her, kneeled before I'm through with this verse

[Hook: King Gordy & MJ Robinson]
