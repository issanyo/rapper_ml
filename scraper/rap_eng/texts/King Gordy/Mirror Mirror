[Hook: King Gordy]
Oh mirror, mirror
Can you tell me what you see? (Kali!)
I'm scared to look at you
Cause you looking back at me (Kali!)
Oh why oh why
Must the mirror show me these things? (Kali!)
Like the ways of the world
And the darkness that it brings (KALI!)

[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm scared of the lightning
Afraid of the thunder
Scared to go to bed
Cause I'm afraid what may be under it
Scared of my black skin and of my people
We all should be running for the steeple
Picture me a paranoid bipolar schizo nigga
World on my shoulder
Curses words and as I'm getting older
I'm sorta kinda tryna find a way to get me higher
A way to escape from the place
Damned by the hellfire and brimstone
I'm stuck in evil people tyranny
They see that gotta be
So the demons is even here in me
God got ya back, though the monster touch ya
Stay praying up cause darkness wants ya
Gotta get away from losing up these news
Watch you off a vodka and juice
So you let loose when you're locked in a booth
Speak clearly, don't nobody come near me
Cause I'm bad for my own health
Save me from my own self, in the mirror

[Hook]

[Verse 2: King Gordy]
Yay see spirits
And me I see visions
Of me being Christian (what?)
Who you calling a Christian?
Oh shit that's me isn't it?
I have fallen in temples
Bleeding from every ligament
Of course I have to lynch us
And now my poor mom is crying in cathedrals
"You are not the son of God, quit lying to these people"
Oh mother they are trying to deceive you
I don't give a Michael Myc for these people
And his eyes be her equal
I have trouble making changes to need you
This mirror opened up my mind
I am Jesus Christ but the sequel
What the hell is this?
My reflection got me feeling devilish
Now I envision heaven with me starring as a terrorist
It's so bad [?]
Startin' wars to the lord
Make me bust hell wide up in the ground floor
Broke up, watch me stage dive right in
Who's come and pick me?
We gon' live a life of sin

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
I'm seeing your reflection, noticing something 'bout ya
Hoping it won't take exorcism, to get this shit up out ya
Sitting in the dark and it's remarkable
How I set my art apart
For the dark ones who whole heartedly been rulin' it
Coolin' at the fact that I made fly
But got the feelin' it's a glass celin'
I can only get yay high
Pullin' world over from under myself
My mental health is interiorating
Tellin' myslef to rebuke Satan
Somebody else inside of me
Hidin' behind the fact that
I'm probably goin' back to my childhood anyway
And if I keep on dreadin' the path of scary thoughts in my past
I'll probably just end up snappin' any day
Some man standin' here booter
I represent the love of God
The wicked world got me feelin' sorta odd
Feel me if you sorta guy, don't try to find that out
Cause the mirror be knownin' me, showin' me inside out so

[Hook]
