[K-Rino]
O-R-I-G- I-N-A-T O-R
Describe K-Rino and N-I-P
Burying new jacks, beating them blue/black
I stack a rapper anatomy higher than two shacks
In the meantime K is throttling minds
Move fast you couldn't catchup if you was a bottle of Heinz
Still spitting about 24s, hoes and bitches
Man you washed up like former dirty clothes and dishes

[Hook: Ganksta NIP]

[K-Rino]
I execute in 3D, the poltergeist in the TV
Invisible hand that slaps you when you turn off the CD
You're bye bye poppa the second you try to step to me
Tight game included, these nuts are sold separately
Systematically quick and graphically seal the fate of them
Me and Gangsta NIP beat a 188 of them
Hourly accosted with dangerous diagnostics
Took the ransom money and still murdered the hostage

[Hook]

[K-Rino]
We travel land that stand for the Dandy Atlantic span
Lyrical Taliban, South Park, Afghanistan
You signed a contract now you think you're fly
But you lost your damn deal before the ink could dry
I'm in the room calculating all the rap fatalities
On a three-way phone call with my other two personalities
I ain't holding back on the drama they needed
Send your punkass home crying, "Mama, they cheated"

[Hook]
