[Chorus: repeat 2X}
Gotta get out of the game, I gotta get out of the game
I gotta get out of the game of slangin' the caine
I gotta get out of the game, I gotta get out of the game
I gotta get out of slangin' muthafuckin' caine

[Dope-E]
I try to get out, but I can't stop
I knock on wood and pray I don't get popped
Nigga livin' lifestyle, don't try to do me
Tha cops made a bust so my dope I had to chew it
I almost blew it, damn dat was close
So I relocated to anotha post
I can't get caught, I've been in jail too many times
Can't get legit jobs so I swing to get mines
I'm in it to win it, if ya gank me I get ya
And two weeks later they find ya floatin' in a bayou
Yo' family, they're cryin', awwh it's too bad
You've been laid in muddy water, eaten by crawdads
This posse found out it was me so now they're after me
A bunch of pussies, they offend to fuck wit me
Cuz then I'll have to shoot 'em, the splatter fleshes drama
Do it mafia style and kill all these fuckin' mamas
King of the kingpins collectin' a payroll
You fuck me and I shoot ya, then cement ya ankles
Cuz I got a rep for takin' no shit, bitch
A serial killa some ya can't fuck wit
And hoes love a dopeman wit money
But all they get is this black pipe cause I ain't no dummy
They track a bro while he up and dis 'im when he down
That's why I cum in they ass, laugh and skip town
"No way cuz the game's here" so many dispute
Bitch get out my face, I'll pull yo' hair out by the roots
Yo' boyfriend owe me money, if ya love 'im betta tell it
I wants my muthafuckin' shit before I kill 'im!

[Chorus]

[Ganksta NIP]
Fuck gettin out, my reputation astound
If my money ain't legit, yo' mama's heart gets ripped out
Ya wanna gank me but ya ain't slick
"Come short one rock?", Oh man naw, ya fiend to die, bitch
It ain't funny, ya think I'm a ho?
.357 to yo' head, why U ain't laughin' no mo'?
Now it's too late, bitch look what ya did
Now here's a [bang] to yo' head, [rat-a-tat-tat] for yo' grandkids
Cops try to control me
It takes 852 jail cells to hold me
Dis Nip? Oh, fuck I'ma dis ya
A Uzi in my hand, yo' family gon' miss ya
I ain't the one to be fucked wit
9mm holopoint cappin' yo' ass, bitch
That crooked cop, he must think that I'm soft
I might start by shootin' up his muthafuckin' house
Got a kilo in my trunk wit sum lead
Mac-10 infrared scope aimed at a cop's head
Niggas geekin' and kidz geekin' too
"Just say no", Bitch fuck you!
The Godfather, I'm alwayz scopin'
Got them bitches in my bed wit their pussy wide open
A nigga snitched, he fucked my connection
They found parts of his daddy's head in every direction
Here come the jump-out boys, let 'em jump out
I'll get the Uzi, Dope-E ya get the bomb out
And let's blast in the dark [rat-a-tat-tat]
36 crooked cops just died in South Park

[Chorus]

[Dope-E]
Creepin' down the street there wit no caine just the other day
There go that nigga who owe me money, I yell "Hey!"
He heard my voice so he bailed down the street
Cuz he know his ass is fiend to get beat
Over the head wit a lead of a gun, teach 'im don't run
That's the way a nigga be slangin up in Houston
Hey yo, Nip, grab the pipe, get yo' back and a gat
[gunshots] Watch his guts splat, fuck it and that's that
Keep my finga on a trigga steady watchin' my stash cash
Gotta move fast cuz cops be watchin' my black ass
See I ain't got a pity over anotha brotha
I'll kill yo' bitch ass and I'm serious than a muthafucka

[Ganksta NIP]
Dope! (Whatta?) Get the muthafuckin' scope
(Got it!) Don't stop shootin', the twenty niggas crawl
Takin' no shit while I'm slangin'
Gank me, they'll find yo' muthafuckin' lil' girl's throat hangin'
Drugs related killings, cops don't bother
16 die from the hands of the Godfather
Lettin' ya know I ain't down for braggin'
Call 911, fuck it, call the meatwagon
You'll die fuckin' wit my dope
Like that nigga they found dead bleedin' wit his neck broke
Slangin' caine ya can never fail
But me and Dope-E see yo' ass in hell, bitch!
