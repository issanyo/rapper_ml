[Verse 1: Ganksta NIP]
Now one little, two little, three crooked cops
Four little, five little, six got shot
Seven little, eight put nine in a box
Two shots a piece now that's eighteen mops
Time to clean my floors with some Mop & Glo
Got the homies from the streets and we shot some more
When the war pops off better shoot that burner
You can call me Brother Nip or you can say Nip Turner
Either one it doesn't matter cause they both some killers
Gangsta Nip came through and bought us both some pillars
Two crooked cops heads homie they inside
If you scared of the war homie stay inside
Hey, duck around the corner better hide your face
If you sprinkle some sugar it'll hide the taste
Administrative leaves, sometimes they have perks
Six months of pay for only one days work

[Chorus: K-Rino]
They got a license to murder us
I hear 'em trying to explain it but not one word I trust
You get to go home to your family you wicked coward
We gotta go to the graveyard to visit ours
You finally popped you one
To you that seems to be funny
Your reward was a vacation with some free money
And in they mind they agree they can shoot any nigga they see
Cause they know that all that's coming is administrative leave

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
Even when the camera clearly shows that they did it
Mystically, magically somehow they get away with it
Kill somebody, get suspended, then get paid with it
Probably bought some dope and let the DA hit it
I can see 'em all plotting, planning, acting bad
And in the aftermath they all go in the back and laugh
A brother dead we can see that writing on the wall
And in most cases ain't no inditement at all
Then they try to tell that lie about the cops ain't racist
And if they do charge 'em usually they drop the cases
Protected by their homeboy judges who known to mob
Two or three weeks later right back on the job
Bucking, jacking, robbing, beating people up, no ducking, no dodging
Causing conflict then getting slapped on the wrist by the lowdown tricks in charge
And don't no peace come to the family of the person that they wipe out
They be still around there doing what they do living their life out

[Chorus: K-Rino]
They got a license to murder us
I hear 'em trying to explain it but not one word I trust
You get to go home to your family you wicked coward
We gotta go to the graveyard to visit ours
You finally popped you one
To you that seems to be funny
Your reward was a vacation with some free money
And in they mind they agree they can shoot any nigga they see
Cause they know that all that's coming is administrative leave

[Outro: K-Rino]
Alright, check this out
I ain't gonna do no third verse on this one
What I'mma do right now man is put something on blast real quick
See, everybody knows the names of all the victims that got killed by dirty racist police
But don't nobody seem to know the names of the police officers and the faces of the ones who did it
So right about now I'mma go down the line and call 'em all out one by one based on the person they killed
Let's go
Alton Sterling was killed by a cop named Blane Salamoni
Tamir Rice was killed by Timothy Loehmann
Mike Brown was killed by that devil Darren Wilson
Eric Garner was killed by Daniel Pantaleo
Walter Scott murdered by Michael Slager
Oscar Grant was killed by Johannes Mehserle
Philando Castile was killed by Jeronimo Yanez
Samuel DuBose was killed by Ray Tensing
Trayvon Martin of course was killed by George Zimmerman
Sandra Bland was set up to be killed by  Brian Encinia
Rekia Boyd, Dante Servin is the one who killed her
He got cleared of all charges
Terence Crutcher was murdered by Betty Shelby
John Crawford killed by Sean Williams
Jonathan Ferrell killed by Randall Kerrick
And Aiyana Jones was murdered by Joseph Weekly
Listen, right about now all these names I mentioned
Find their pictures
Put 'em on social media man
Let everybody become familiar with their faces
So we'll know them when they're walking down the street
Cause right now they're just living their life comfortably
Feeling like they got away with murder
So that's your assignment
We ain't taking this no more
It's justice or else
10,000 fearless
Let's get it
Yeah
All praise is do to Allah
