[Verse 4: K-Rino]
Yo, you can give a man a brain but will he think?
I give him water like the rain but will he drink?
I hit the punk with everything but the kitchen sink
The Universe is like a chain, I'm the missing link
Every time I open up my book
I'm reading with my eyes but I use my mind to look
Seeing with my intellect I travel to the deep
My brain draws a picture even when I'm fast asleep
Sketching, like an architect, a building made of thoughts
Comprehending wisdom years before it's even taught
Talent makes the master kick a rap or even scene
The writer metamorphosize into Stephen King
Time is running out but I won't let 'em see the clock
Decipher spirit codes and the take the form of kilo rock
Conditions make me realise that niggas coming soon
Got hype in outerspace and rode around across the Moon
Vocally I'm powerful, I catapult through space
Words disintegrate aver a tonne of toxic waste
Physically as well as mathematically precise
Yesterday a psychic called and asked me for advice
K-Rino is too aerodynamically equipped
Witness a rage he stage, niggas pages ripped
Vocals I dissimulate the victim like they're slow
The slightest touch is equal to a thousand Tyson blows
