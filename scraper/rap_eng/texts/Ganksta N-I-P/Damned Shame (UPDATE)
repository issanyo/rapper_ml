(Intro: Ganksta N-I-P & Dope-E):

Dope-E: What's wrong, NIP?
Ganksta N-I-P: Yeah man. Life's going terrible in South Park, man. Everybody killing each other, man, we need to stop, this is a message for the gangsta niggas...
Dope-E: That's right, man!
Ganksta N-I-P: (Inaudible), man. Yeah...
Dope-E: Yo NIP, tell 'em straight-up like it is, man. No shortcuts, man, South Park style, man

(Verse 1: Ganksta N-I-P and background vocals by Dope-E):

Dope walls in Houston are getting rough, that's the third dope-house that the dope fiend shot up. *(Dope-E: Damn, man.)*
Brothers killin' other brothers, for a funky dime (inaudible) kills mother his own mother. *(Dope-E: Damn.)*
Straight up madness, six dead bodies results in sadness. Dope mean shootin' up, nobody's gettin' up, pints of blood, they're spittin' up. *(Dope-E: Damn.)*
When will they quit? Three witnesses, they won't say shit! (Dope-E: Nothing.)*. South Park is the hood where it's done, if you walking by yourself you must be packing a gun, 'cause if you not, you finna get stomped! *(Dope-E: Yep!)*. You might be a victim of the 12-gauge pump! *(Gun blast*)
To the head, in goes the lead, on the news they pronouncing another brother's dead! *(Dope-E: Damn.)*
So much blood spill, if you shoot you live, if you don't you get killed. (Dope-E: Huh!)* And they say black people's to blame! *(Background voice: What?)*. Maaan, that's a damn shame!

(Interlude: Ganksta N-I-P & Dope-E):

*(Background "Life ain't shit to fool with" vocal sample)*
Ganksta N-I-P: You know man, life ain't got to be like this
Dope-E: That's right!
Ganksta N-I-P: Everybody make you sit back and stop killing...

(Verse 2: Ganksta N-I-P & background vocals by Dope-E):

I had a homeboy, his name was Darryl Bradley *(Dope-E: Yeah, i know him.)*, the way he died it was sad to see! It's like this one thursday night (Dope-E: What's up?)*, drinkin' the 40s and gettin' high as a kite
Here comes my homeboy Russ *(Dope-E: Russ.)*, him and Darryl Bradley begins to fuss! Russ had a gun in his case (Dope-E: Doing what?)*, wavin' it inside my homeboy's Darryl's face
So Darryl said *(Dope-E: Chill, man.)* "chill, man! Won't you go, with that gun before some blood spill, man!" *(Dope-E: Uh huh.)*. But Russ wouldn't leave with the gun *(Dope-E: Nope.)*, D.B. was hard, so he didn't run *(Dope-E: Yeah.)*! They started fighting, and Darryl got the best, *(Dope-E: Ohh, shit.)* all of a sudden, *(gun blast)*, to Darryl's chest! Russ retreated and got away *(Dope-E: What's it...)*, shiiit, 5-0 got his ass the next day *(Dope-E: Huh!)*
(Inaudible) all the lead, now Russ is in jail, and Darryl's dead *(Dope-E: Damn!)*! Kill was the aim... maaaan, that's a damned shame!

(Interlude: Ganksta N-I-P & Dope-E):

*(Background "Life ain't shit to fool with" vocal sample)*
Dope-E: Yep!
Ganksta N-I-P: Yo, it's like this. We love you Darryl Bradley. Everybody in South Park is groovin' for you in here
Dope-E: Peace
Ganksta N-I-P: Peace
Dope-E: Peace

(Verse 3: Ganksta N-I-P & background vocals by Dope-E):

Police brutality operates undercover, instead of a ticket, they beat on a brother *(Dope-E: Yeah.)*, and when they tryna get away from the brutal fest *(Dope-E: What they say?)*, they say "resisting arrest". Now how in the hell they gonna let that pass? Cops supposed to help, not whoop on a brother's ass! *(Dope-E: Yeah.)*
Goin' insane is what i order *(Dope-E: Naw.)*, but then again i turn my tape on ''Slaughter''! *(Dope-E: Pow.)* Yeah!
And listen to the things that i say, get the gat *(gun blast)*, now whassup with that fool? I'm tired of this bull, i'm ready to pull, blast and blast *(gun blasts)* 'til the graveyard's full!
Everyday a young brother gets (inaudible: dragged)! Kicked in the face, and whooped with a billy club *(Dope-E: Damn!)*! Then they take you to jail, throw you in a cell, beat you again, now how the hell you gon' win *(Dope-E: Yeah!)*, but when you get out... take revenge no doubt! Do it for the brothers, and put some heads out! *(Dope-E: Slaughter!)*
And when it's over, don't take the blame, let the white man say *(Dope-E: Huh!)*, "that's a damn shame"!

(Outro: Ganksta N-I-P & background vocals by Dope-E):

*(Background "Life ain't shit to fool with" vocal sample)*
Dope-E: Yeah
Ganksta N-I-P: Yeah. You motherfuckas don't know
Dope-E: Tell 'em right here, NIP...
Ganksta N-I-P: (Inaudible: I'll let) police brutality, we ain't takin' that shit no more
Dope-E: (Inaudible: No more.)
Ganksta N-I-P: PEACE, Rodney King!
Dope-E: Yeah, givin' a shout out to Lil' Mud too, man. It's time to hit back, and fight back, for what's right. Yeah, let's do it, NIP!
