[Ganksta Nip]
Yo, yo, yo. What's up? It's your boy Ganksta Nip
Showin love for everybody
Lettin everybody know it's a new millennium. We gotta get our minds right
We can't go into the new millennium with the old mind state
Which is ignorance, know what I'm sayin?
We gotta come together, pull our resources
Praise God, and hope, for the best

[Verse One]
I over came everything
Every obstacle tryin to hold me down
And young G that's a shame
The way brothers do brothers cold
It ain't worth sellin your soul to go gold
And that ain't real, and I'ma tell you the deal
Homies locked in the pen, tryin to get in the pen
I gotta, keep strivin and raise on up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff
I keep God in my heart I stay so smart
Billboard psychopath, and I'm holdin the charts
I can't be held down I can't be held
Hold up, I think I just saw the five-o's roll up
Never ever on the street can i let somebody drop me
My determination is to great to let somebody stop me
Psycho Nip, South Park, A soldier with heart
And I got love for Lil J for givin me my start

(Hook)

I gotta keep strivin' and raise in up
And you can't hold me down like that Mase and Puff

(Repeat 4X)

[Verse Two]
Rest in peace Fat Pat, cause cops gon' drop
Same thing Big Steve, cause the love don't stop
Bobby Boy, ESG, and Lil Keke
And bring it back to DJ Skew and I'm the psych N-I-P
And C-Note, Mad Hatter playa keep on sippin
Herschelwood understood D-E-A ain't trippin
We showin love everybody comin with skills
KB [?] house park side keepin it real
And we ain't trippin, even bout no [???] man
Holla at the South Park Mexican
For real, this the deal, Psycho Nip come skills
Robert Muhammad, mosque 45, knowledge to build
But I'ma psycho thug I come from down south
And I'm holla at Lo' Light, 5th Ward Boys in the house
And Double-O, E-Roc, Yellow Twins ain't afraid
And if it wasn't for Scarface I woulda never got paid

(Hook 4X)

[Verse Three]
And I'm from H-Town, where we hustle for skrilla
Where my hustlers move keys young playa we killas
All Day MLK these boys slang lley
Ounce, six quarters, halfs, and bust AK's
We roll thick, trick, we [???] with guns
And if we don't hit the weed lounge
We gon' hit the [??], for real
Who's the rapper to put South Park and the map
It was me N-I-P Psycho Nip with a strap, for real

[Ganksta Nip]
You know what I'm sayin?
It's your boy Ganksta Nip
First playa world wide with an album from South Park
Much love to J.B. on the track. Slash on the mix. Know what I'm sayin?
And it's done, engineered at Pyya Rhytums
