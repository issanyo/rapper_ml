[Verse 3: Murder One]

[Verse 4: K-Rino]
I say hold up, Mudrer One, no need to click until I say blast
Fuck the radio, fuck George Bush, and fuck [Jay Mack?] with his gay ass
Y'all ain't paid no mind to us, straight bomb no time to fuss
Turn that wack-ass rhyme to dust, automatic artillery designed to bust
My versatile arsenal consists of an uncounterable weapon
[Twelve reppin' we let you bring not?]
See I'm a bomb, and you just a slingshot
Your whole clique vowed to never lose a battle I vowed
Got seven females pregnant at a show when I jacked off in the crowd
See this is somethin' for you haters to come and get
Man I told you I do not play that ho shit
Witness K-Rino designed the shit, release a rhyme and quit
Do ten shows and still be back in bed with yo momma in time to hit
