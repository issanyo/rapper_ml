[Verse 1: Hoodizm]
I stay focused, life’s all about balance
Success breeds [?] ‘cause God gave me this talent
I never rode the bench, I always been a starter
And overtime gon’ cost you more than four quarters
Big mouths I slap shut and slap nuts I vanquish
Flap them lips too much you’ll leave using sign language
Call me king ‘cause I wreck ‘em, polish ‘em with my septum
Trap ‘em when I catch ‘em, put motion sensors in they rectum
And then I send ‘em through so they can roam the blue
And you bet not call the police ‘cause every step you take I’ll be watching you
I’ll be watching you, I swear every step you take I’ll be watching you

[Verse 2: Sniper]
Sick militant flow, [?] like a carbine
Explicit with the lyrics, watch me blow like a time bomb
Soldier of fortune, no time for the outcome
SPC, where the hell Sniper come from?
H-Town, baby, no love for you busters
Regime too raw, that’s why they don’t love us
The Mexican patna reppin’ SPC
Nobody in the game doing it like me
I’m surrounded by history, a legend in the making
K-Rino said homie that it’s mine for the taking
Can’t mess with the warriors, I’m bringing the pain
Snipe with the beast, militant mind-frame

[Verse 3: Rapper K]
Rapper K is the answer to the question of who is it
Got the call from the [?], flip my tongue like a lizard
Had no choice but to react when I first heard this track
Started jottin’ down lines in the back of the Lac
Contemplating to myself, now where should I begin?
I’m headed to the lab, my phone rings, it’s K again
Said, “I’m giving you a heads-up, you better bring your A-game
‘cause GT just killed it and Sniper wasn’t playin’
I arrived at the lab and heard this sh*t, he wasn’t frontin’
Now I’m standing at the mic, I’m ‘bout to spit something
I’m ‘bout to shine, ‘bout to go for mine
I only got twelve lines, ah sh*t, I’m outta time

[Verse 4: Cl’ Che]
Cool game, [?]
Not only hood, they internationally know my name
Cl’ Che but you can call me Ms West
The only rap chick in South Park in the library history chest
SPC, SUC, you can run across me, legendary emcee
Every word in my lyrics done paid dues
Google me, baby, under the keyword “She’s a [?]”
They hittin’ me from Germany saying, “Cl’ Che’s cool”
They can’t speak English but they rappin’ every word I put in Pro Tools
Spit something or just repeat this, “She’s a [?] little mama and she’s a bad chick

[Verse 5]
Just as is Anakin Skywalker before transforming to Darth Vader
My pen takes the form of a lightsaber
We touching the paper, my thoughts condense from vapors
My neighbors savor the flavor like babies pacing in front of a pit filled with alligators
When calibrating my brain, can’t remain unanimated
I allocated a heavy dose of pain, it’s navigated
Straight to your mainframe through the main vein
You strain in vain to maintain but can’t contain
The flame the God rained down with love for Abel but disdain for Cain
Who he labeled a murderer of his brother, which was unstable and deranged
But now we gang-bang and slang ‘caine

[Verse 6: Murder One]
I’m a South Park assassin that’s sicker than straw fakers
Walk-ins are [?], take upon all takers
[?] God bless you and your mama
When f*ckin’ with Murder, you end up with multiple head trauma
I talk the talk, walk the walk
So ease on down the road [?] end up in chalk
I have no preference who I devour, man
Me with a hundred round clip make it easy to shower man
Now whoever thought Murder One was a rowdy man
A everyday cat that runs with a rowdy clan
South Park Coalition is the name of this rowdy band
Murder One [?] and I’m outie man

[Verse 7: K-Rino]
I spot moon rocks with my optics
Got subatomic harpoons and deadly monsoons in my pocket
I pause and start morphing
Inner body experience where I enter your body and crush organs
I think 'til the floor spins
I'm still bombing after the war ends, endorphins so strong they make swords bend
Live and execute a rough lyrics prolific shooter
In the womb receiving visions from my physics tutor
Once the beat ignites, no more MCs in sight
I'm from a planet where midgets are seven feet in height
I don't let cowards speak plus my powers deep
Work for nine years in a row and recharge on a hour's sleep

[Verse 8]
Officer Cartwheel, officer Cooper
Tuck your tails in when you see us on street, if not, we shoot ya
On your way to hell ‘cause heaven you never made it
Walk around in your shell ‘cause your soul’s been desecrated
Don’t slouch, keep my pistol in perfect pouch
Hit you when you in your Snuggie, sittin’ on your curvy couch
Rhymes blow up, scar you in legions
Twisted metal travels to equatorial regions
Retaliation got a lot of remedies
One by one your family members erased like Kennedys
I’m a rapper slash producer slash terrorist
Slash illuminati grow from ear to ear, I’m the scariest

[Verse 9]
Out a playa know his mama planted the truth in me
And grew up so big ’til it popped, now it’s loose in me
Mind frame brain ain’t the same that it used to be
I rather live life than chase women and jewelry
Spit game came with a heavenly layer
[?] beware, [?] be everywhere
It ain’t no playin’ with you, busters, I will shoot in the air
But instead of spittin’ some bullets, I’ma spit you a prayer
Dear God, let ‘em ride, give ‘em where to survive
Leave ’em alive, even if he wishing I died
And dear God, let ‘em ride even if we collide
‘cause I know even when I’m wrong, I want you on my side
And that’s [?]

[Verse 10]
Spittin’ at you fools, [?]
Kick down doors, go and stage [?]
Seek the truth, gain self-knowledge
Educate yourself, as well as go college
Spit from the mind, spit to the beat
Spit from the heart, spit for those raised on the streets
Words transcribe onto paper without thinking
Some think they’re on top but I see ‘em sinking
I’m a spitter, old school tagger
Flows still sharp like a sharpened dagger
Climb the ladder from the gutter to the stage
Now I spit something just to earn my wage

[Verse 11]
It’s the return of [?]
Class of ’89, bloodline SPC
I’m a lyrical train-wreck, spot-rocker, [?]
[?]
Slam dunk kind of flow
Shattered the glass in South Park but I was on the court in Tokyo
Half man, half silverback
Half of my opponent hanging out my mouth
I got an anaconda’s digestive tract
Assassin’s Creed [?] hard when I spit
But [?] so hard [?] and jumped on my d*ck
[?] rare breed of the SPC seed
[?] signing out live from [?], yo

[Verse 12]
Uh, full block say goodbye when I spit something
That’s for ni**as left [?], we burn and get to dumpin’
That’s for ni**as thinking they chick won’t leave ‘cause a ni**a rich
But when [?], she got hooked on the bigger fish
I’m like the old school Wu, all about cream
Getting to the [?] been like sippin’ on lean
Gotta spit something, bringing out the [?] team
Got enough drive for two and a half men, call me Charlie Green
I’m in the streets with that thing, I gotta get it right
You can dodge for so long like Eddie, my chopper Scary Spice
I leave the [?] like a college grad [?]
What I spit, ni**as catching bullets like a young Jerry Rice

[Verse 13: Point Blank]
Point Blank, the Southside OG
They know the real so they still keep they eyes on me
You might not see me on BET or things of that nature
Can’t get no play when ni**as at the radio station hate ya
One thing they can’t take from me is the streets
A lot of these pussies can’t be found in the streets
Yeah, like [?] I’m all over
Call me AI when I hit the state-line and I crossover
I represent Texas like Vince, a boss like Prince, you can check my prints
You might see me in the club with some Lords and Bloods
Got a sherm flow motherf*ckin’ enjoy the drugs
Wanna get high with the Blankster? F*ck that
The door closed, all you b*tch ni**as and you fake h*es
South Park Coalition, that’s us
Remember that when you start talkin’ ‘bout Houston and don’t mention us

[Verse 14]
I’m suffering, my heart is in pain
I’m a madman ‘cause the whole world is insane
I read scriptures ‘cause decisions come too hard
Money, cash, currency — which is our true god?
Good or bad, right or wrong, life’s a seesaw
Sometimes the straight and narrow path has a detour
My mind clicks like a snare with a mob kick
Ideas spark like a high hat constant
The city breeze, the streets are a part of me
Danger don’t bother me, there’s ice water in my arteries
I mean-mug a alligator like he did something
Stared a cobra eye to eye, dared him to spit something

[Verse 15]
[?] spit hot lava disperse
Rough like [?] tryna quench a thirst
Must release a verse among the first
Clicked up fools puttin’ up in a hearse
Pressure bust pipes where the sh*t done burst
These fools right here are the worst
Claim your turf, we claim the earth
Hardest clique b*tch from the birth
Only curse is spittin’ the truth
Call the laws when in the booth
Soft ass h*es pray to live
This track missing one thing, AC Chill

[Verse 16]
Ni**as always ask me why I kick this psycho sh*t
I got a axe with ten blades that I might go get
If I explain it to you, ni**a, then you will get hit
Tell your mama it’s a black dress she needs to go get
When it sticks in, that motherf*cker makes me proud
Spray blood so thick and far it looks like a cloud
And I love ‘em so much that I named all ten
But I won’t say they names ’til they all go in and come out
The brains left [?] for stains
And that’s the reason why I gave ‘em ten different names
Like Becky, Robert, Kevin, Michael and Drew
Keisha, [?], K-Rino, you name the last two uh

[Verse 17]
It all started
In the kitchen with a mission, tryna beat the competition
Treat it like a job so I can retire with a pension
Hit the block with a [?], four oz’s in my pocket
I’m outta control, you just can’t stop me
J. Water in this b*tch and I’m spittin’ on the mic
And I promise that I can do it all night
Yeah motherf*ckin’ ni**as, SPC
When you lookin’ for that white girl, come see me
I’m a beast in these streets, monster in this motherf*ckin’ game
When they call me, I let them bullets rain
No matter the consequences, I’m still here
Sippin’ syrup, smoking’ herb in the atmosphere, yeah, hahh

[Verse 18]
I politick when it come to spit these rhymes
Boy talkin’ about my rep, man, ‘cause they ain’t got a style like mine
I’m the new generation, I got the remedy to rep
No disabilities, only the ability to snap
I'll take words and abstract, you can call me analyst
Boy talkin’ ‘bout they gon’ run when they peters can’t even spit sh*t
Ni**as like the way I rip this, my tongue I flip it
Yeah they like the way I spit it

[Outro: K-Rino]
See, how many times have we done this, man?
How many clique songs have you heard over the years from the South Park Coalition?
All the way down, slipped into a coma murder script
Name on a bullet, the original South Park Coalition
This what we do, man
So all the rappers around the world, y’all keep on makin’ y’all clique songs, man
Let’s keep this thing going, we can keep throwing
Keepin’ that work in, mash on these tricks, yeah, haha, that’s it, it ain’t enough room in this booth for all us
