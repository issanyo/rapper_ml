[Intro: K-Rino]
K-Rino, I'm tryna learn how to see with my mind closed and my eyes closed
I'm tryna learn how to see with everything closed
So when I can't open it in public
I can still see, check it out

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
One rhyme locks 'em in jail, boxing in Hell and sending rappers smallpox in the mail
And throwing punches that make oxygen swell
The fourth quarter will determine whose talent is harder
Slaughter victims in order while drinking a gallon of water
My task see who I can make die fast
Bury the hate and carry the weight of the world on one of my eyelashes
Huh, the flow arena ain't a soft thing
I married the Grim Reaper's daughter and had a half-dead half-living offspring
Smothered a dude mind suffocation [?]
From his throat doctors removed a fully inflated inner tube
Soul and body separation, gas inhalation
Bowels wasting, now your habitation is your own defecation
And it's ironic the Hell raiser that's never been demonic
I'm dropping more shit then a 300lb man getting a colonic
Nuclear bombers the wicked pharmacist armed with enormous skill
Let's play in a pool of sharks and see who remains the calmest

[Chorus: Ganksta NIP & Dope-E]
When he rhyme he change forms most times it's a lizard
K-Rino the ultimate lyricist we call him the Wizard
When he rhyme he switch bodies clinging to your spirit
The Black Book is the magic wand, wicked spells from the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
The Wizard, the Wizard, don't be fucking with the Wizard

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
My self esteem overcame your lame decapitating scheme
My neck was redeemed after breaking the blade on a guillotine
A rapid eye movement stopper, cancelling your dream
Im leaving threatening messages on my own answering machine
Hear my voice and it rakes, people sleeping in spain from the noise that it makes
Hanging in jungles trading venom with poisonous snakes
My words burn heated your head like a perm
I was murdering rappers like you when I was just a sperm
Your style is drafted while mine was brain crafted from God tactics
Subtracting active wackness with acrobatical rap back flips
You need nursing im bursting a verse when I heard cursing
Duplicate my body twice and start speaking in third person
I'm impossible to hit, start breaking your cycle quick
Defeating me is like a blind man tryna tackle Michael Vick
Turn the sound up, have a paroxysm and frown up
Reverse the game and make the rain travel from the ground up

[Chorus: Ganksta NIP & Dope-E]
When he rhyme he change forms most times it's a lizard
K-Rino the ultimate lyricist we call him the Wizard
When he rhyme he switch bodies clinging to your spirit
The Black Book is the magic wand, wicked spells from the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
The Wizard, the Wizard, don't be fucking with the Wizard

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
In the beginning I had one Black Book, nothing more
But see one day I slammed it on the ground and it split into 4
See im greata then Montezuma, my name can cause a tumor
I was spotted on a mountain top studying scriptures with a puma
I smashed a golden calf with a staff and taught heightened math
My paragraph is sharp enough to slice light in half
Intestines blow when I face you bro
Magnetic flow, evil enough to scare the wetness from H2O
Rhyme dispersal is done without rehearsal
I rap against my own self like M.J. in that commercial
I drop fire like a space craft when it launches
Once it's started, I throw punches that leave planets unconscious

[Chorus: Ganksta NIP & Dope-E]
When he rhyme he change forms most times it's a lizard
K-Rino the ultimate lyricist we call him the Wizard
When he rhyme he switch bodies clinging to your spirit
The Black Book is the magic wand, wicked spells from the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
We will kill you if you fucking with the Wizard
The Wizard, the Wizard, don't be fucking with the Wizard
