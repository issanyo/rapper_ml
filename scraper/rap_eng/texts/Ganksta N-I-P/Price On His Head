When You Hate To Love
Remember
Time To Grow Up
Fall Down

[Intro: Gangsta Nip]
[Laughs]
Aye how much this muthafucking head right here mane, you knahsayin?
Not the one with the muthafucking black eye
But the one with the blue eyes!
Kill!

[Hook: K-Rino]
Me say price on his head
Me say price on his head
Track him down and stop him like a light when it's red
He was terrified begging for his life, he was scared
But they still found him dead with his wife in the bed
Me say price on his head
Me say price on his head
Track him down and stop him like a light when it's red
He was terrified begging for his life, he was scared
But they still found him murdered with his wife in his bed

[Verse 1: Gangsta NIP]
Graphic details, pictures images
Vividly well-spoken to slaughter my nemesis
Turned to Genesis, while you riding a see-saw
And back to Ezekiel and using what he saw
Me on the wheel just standing still
The god of this site shit you know the deal
I'm a scientist that's the reason you study me
But there's another level once you come meet the other me!
The [?] brain stay sharp as a pencil
I learn to make miracles with kitchen utensils
A fork or a spoon I'm a serial killer
I'm good with a knife but I love the scissors
Make ya lungs collapse and all that good shit
So who the fuck you think, roast a Chucky for bush wick?
I'm ready for battle, till these niggas is dead
Imitating muthafuckers got a price on they head

[Hook: K-Rino]
Me say price on his head
Me say price on his head
Track him down and stop him like a light when it's red
He was terrified begging for his life, he was scared
But they still found him dead with his wife in the bed
Me say price on his head
Me say price on his head
Track him down and stop him like a light when it's red
He was terrified begging for his life, he was scared
But they still found him murdered with his wife in his bed

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
Yeah, you put your head on the line where you decided to tell
Now you gotta a nice price on it like you was on sell
You know the streets is real the youth the targets
Hate growing 'cause the Black president is in office
Fool the devil situation been sinking in failing
If you ride with the Tea Party you stupid like Sarah Palin
Playing and wasting time while you under the knife
Put the blunt down for a second man and think about life
You say it ain't racist when a brother gets beat and they tape it
Showing to the world in court and still manage to escape it
They want you in they jails (uh) stop putting yourself in 'em
A worldwide genocidal-plot and y'all helping him
Once the head spin it'll certainly hurt a bit
We the victims of a four-hundred fifty year murder hit
See they want your birthright; they took our rights at birth
It's the undercover auction how much is your life worth?

[Hook: K-Rino]
Me say price on his head
Me say price on his head
Track him down and stop him like a light when it's red
He was terrified begging for his life, he was scared
But they still found him dead with his wife in the bed
Me say price on his head
Me say price on his head
Track him down and stop him like a light when it's red
He was terrified begging for his life, he was scared
But they still found him murdered with his wife in his bed

[Verse 3: Point Blank]
If a nigga want you hit it might not cost him shit
What block you come from? Who team you play with?
What hood you represent? What you fall under nigga the five or the six?
Street gangsta politics
Never know when they watching ya, and that's when they'll spot ya
Same nigga that did it standing there when they popped ya, yeah
Most all cowards, don't know how to act
When they get a little paper and call hoes on they back
Being a gangsta come with a responsibility
And it's always consequence dealing with a bunch of currency
Your best man can be the one to shove a knife in ya
Or a bitch mad at'cha, tryna get back at'cha
If these haters coming on different shapes and forms
Book you for a show and beat yo ass after you perform
Remember any nigga can get got
Any nigga can get touched, any nigga in hip hop!

Me say price on his head

But they still found him dead with his wife in the bed
Me say price on his head
Me say price on his head
Track him down and stop him like a light when it's red
He was terrified begging for his life, he was scared
But they still found him murdered with his wife in his bed
