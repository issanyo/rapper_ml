[Intro: Ganxsta NIP]
Welcome, this is your boy Psycho NIP, SPC
And we’re in the last days
You should be listening to K-Rino
And let me tell you why
He’s a minister of ministries and you know what goes on in the streets
So if he tell you it’s the last days,  it is the last days

[Verse 1: K-Rino]
God made man in his own image after his likeness
To be an earthly reflection of his righteous preciseness
He brought something out of nothing, my word is my bond
And the creation of man and the Universe corresponds
The one Sun controls the nine planets
The 1 and the 9 makes up a 19, the math is real simple once you understand it
The one brain controls the nine systems of the man’s anatomy
Connecting our anatomy to the galaxy
See what I’m saying might sound worthless so let me come back to the surface
‘cause Like the Moon my thoughts used to be where the Earth is
But I got lifted and elevated to a state
Where I could kill word giants with math and science
If you want your instance to continue beyond physical life, then you
Must become a venue for God’s spirit to live up in you
That’s when you find yourself standing
On a plane where you constantly are sinning, level after level, never landing
We in the last days

[Hook: K-Rino]
The last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the present, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prism, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prison, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
The last days, the last days

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
If God is with me who can be against me?
And since we sinning immensely, death is close and can’t no atheist convince me
See the time we living in is real crucial
We standing in the Valley of Decision and ain’t none of the ground neutral
You holler, “Dear Lord”, but yet you fear man when you should fear God
But remember Jesus returned packing a sword, dripping blood
So while we out he rapping ‘bout cars, the slurp, the jewellery, the weed
The world is suffering from war, hatred and greed
Huh and bomb threats got you sweating
Feeling threatened ‘cause we getting closer to the war of Armageddon
Where the canvas is damaged and burnt up from New York to Los Angeles
Glances at death for each man the scandalous evangelist
To make it all simple and plain
Farrakhan’s the man we need to listen to, no matter what religion that you claim
And the scriptures make it clear
That with war tanks around Jerusalem, the end is near, that time is here
We in the last days

[Hook: K-Rino]
The last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the present, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prism, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prison, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
The last days, the last days

[Verse 3: K-Rino]
Some people get confused when they’re watching the news
But the time can be recognised through the scriptures if we can decipher the clues
The last ten years went quick, notice the time acceleration
America’s the mystery Babylon spoken of in Revelation
Now me standing at the front door of the judgement, man
Where the fire was prophesized and like in the past when the floods came
And the powers of the world be promoting sin and we loving it
And the dragon mentioned in the Bible represents the government
So flashback to the Book of Genesis 15 to 13
Where God speaks to Abram about returning to the sea
And the seed would be a stranger in a land that’s not theirs
And they will serve and be afflicted for 400 years
After which time God would judge that nation and theat man
That seed was the black people and America was the land
Now we stand in the belly of the beast
Where wars in the Holy Land won’t cease and boys get raped by catholic priests
Where murders and drug use is at an increase
Disease and unusual weather patterns, no justice, no peace
North against the South, West versus the East
‘cause when the seals got broken, all Hell was released
We in the last days

[Hook: K-Rino]
The last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the present, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prism, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
Can’t survive in the prison, living with them past ways
We in the last days, the last days
The last days, the last days
