[Intro]
Oh
Big Ron the don
In here with the leader of the SPC and the general
Know what I'm talking about?
A hit list
They just going down the line
Marking off mark ass niggas that be lying
Know what I'm talking about?
Ain't never had a fight in they life

[Verse 1: Ganksta Nip]
So many copycats, six feet deep is where they laying
I won't even mention murders done by Timothy McVeigh
Bodies float in the river, that's the reason you quiver
Cut your liver to the point to where the insects shiver
And tell me that they don't want none, they tell me they full
They say they gained 10 pounds each from 2 dead bulls
SPC roundup, we ready to ride
The wire cutters, they wouldn't stop until my arms got tired
See I'm a real psychopath, I come to set things straight
And John Gacy wasn't tripping off the people he ate
See if you biting on my rap style you bound to get beat
To add another dead corpse to the freezer full of meat
And bags of ligaments, he passed away in the mud
The doctors called me just to tell me that they ran out of blood
And that they need much more, cause Nip has skills
That's just some psycho shit I think about doing for real

[Verse 2: K-Rino]
It take years for my words to kick in, it’s true
Lines I kicked in ’92, got fools today now going, “Wooooo!”
I spark a rhyme curse at 9 tonight
He stole my book then read a verse and now he blind for life
Understand my voice is powerful, you never hit gate
I train it by swallowing gas with Everclear straight
Elevate, I’m like a rap and running back I’m so cold
Rushed for 2000 rhymes last year, went to the floorboard
See my eyes, look at them deeper, now you’re starting to strain
I bring trauma to rappers, causing heart attacks in the brain
It’s death, so I delete the rules then murder the rep
You experience me throwing right jabs with my left
Marvelous specimen, mind over matter, master quantum leaping
No panic, I’m in the midst of violent earthquakes and sleeping
Deep in meditative process, my verses are many
You think you got more flow than K and NIP, whatever, bet 20 fool

[Hook: K-Rino]
You on my hit list and I don’t ball ya
I’ve been waiting to violate ya the first time I saw ya
Commit the murder real slow and prolong the pain
And swing till the blood pours out like the rain

[Verse 3: Ganksta Nip]
You see it's nothing but murder inside the mind of a psych
Sick ass thoughts makes me vision pints of blood in the Sprite
Pop the top, drink some, if you really ready
See if you get the machete, then I'll go eat the spaghetti
Eminem, he going to get fucked off, cause I can't stand him
It's nothing but executions in my memorandum
SPC is nothing but a knife in fact
Switch up and change my voice white boy, can you do that?
I'm your idol, don't front, you know I'm the man
They'll find you slapped up and wrapped up in two stolen vans
Cut up in bits and pieces till I make him my word
I tried to make him something plural, like a noun or a verb
Something like D-I-T-C-H is a ditch
And if I wasn't a psychopath white boy my voice wouldn't switch
AKs with 50 round clips is my ammunition
Get crunk and your body parts will come up missing

[Verse 4: K-Rino]
I crack at 'em with rap patterns, the phantasm that left instrumentals with track spasms
The force of my intercourse is like infinite orgasms
In fact I'm a black fist master slashing a sword past him
Murder with both hands, I go agger than Dave Banner
Infected your whole sect in an ambidextrous manner
Electrical manuscript, I leave rappers with head shots
Could be paraplegic but still put you in a figure-4 leglock
Soldiers watch for the red dot, try me
'cause be slashing, behind me, it's Red Rum and I'm coming
Strong enough to impregnate a dead woman
I drop a scary infection and cancel every connection
You'll be the first man to receive a cesarean section
Go deeper than an extreme marine biologist
Vocabulary so big a tyrannosaurus esophagus couldn't swallow this
K-Rino the seed, 90 ropes couldn't tie me
Most of my victims died happy, just honored to be murdered by me

[Hook x2: K-Rino]
You on my hit list and I don’t ball ya
I’ve been waiting to violate ya the first time I saw ya
Commit the murder real slow and prolong the pain
And swing till the blood pours out like the rain
