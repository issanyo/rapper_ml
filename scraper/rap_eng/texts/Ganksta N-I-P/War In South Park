[K-Rino]
Yo, there was a war in South Park
Two o'clock in the daytime the sky was dark
No joke, I'm running through black smoke and dirt
Saw Point Blank on MLK looking hurt, he said..

[Point Blank]
Dope fiend set me up
Now I'm backtracking myself to see where I done fucked up
At, K-Rino, get the gat for me
I don't think I got the nuts, I want you to dispose of me

[K-Rino]
Blank, you better think before your life crumbles
What you want me to tell Nip? (On a fear, no trouble)
Aight, man, let's get this shit straight
What tool should I use?

[Point Blank]
I prefer the .38 to the dome cause to bad dreams I'm prone
I'm tired of this world, Lord I'm ready to come home
I can't handle it, I'm so afraid I might damage it
So I drop to my knees and use it to my advantage
K, it's funny to think I was making a lot of money
Fell in love with dollar signs and I guess it growed on me
But in reality I fucked up a lot of minds
Destroyed braincells, now I'm losing mine
I'm on the edge and I'm 'bout to jump off
So I'mma sacrifice myself and take it as a loss
It was was hard to choose but I chose the bullet
K, you supposed to be my nigga, now pull it [*gunshot*]

[K-Rino]
Yo, so I bailed out and my pace sped
Running full speed while my chest and my face bled
Death Busy didn't know exactly
Who I was cause he charged me with his gun pointed at me
Saying:

[DBX]
Boy, what the fuck is wrong with you K, thrusting up on me like that?
But aiyo, take this TV, Eyque's parked in the back
Boy you be flipping on all the shit
We'll have so much shit I'll have an entertainment centre in my bathroom
I heard explosions, screams and shootings
We ran here for ammo, saw keyboard pianos and ended up looting
Perfect timing like Rain Man and my main man
Came up with a game plan to steal that van, you coming or what, man?

[K-Rino]
So we ran to a shack, ten brothers broke us down with a sneak attack
From trying to fight them off, I felt a bone of my fist cracked
They tied us to some dynamite, I thought we would lose out
Till Murder1 came and blew the fuse out

[Murder1]
Murder One fear no danger
My main lady, the 380 taking out motherfuckers
Hanging in South Park car watch me and Guess
Some young punk pulled a gun to Guess' chest
(Then what happened?) I remember I was packing
I felt like Clint Eastwood but smiling while I'm capping
Yo, you know how the story goes
Money, women, cars, booming system, ______ and foes
See, like trouble follow me
Another funeral, another brother made history
A cop came and accidental
A gunshot, I looked up, it was A.C. Chill

[A.C. Chill]
Gunfire, gun smoke, motherfucker's neck broke
But I be fucking face he choke
In South Park it gets dark, I find a sharp dart
So I stuck it in a fool's heart
Cause they tried to blow my hood up
But as fast as they step up I gotta light their ass up
And that was why and still why
I had to let motherfuckers live, now I gotta let them die
Because it's my responsibility
To shoot a motherfucker in the face if he fuck with me
A.C.'s the name you should remember
Cause I can make it hot as fuck, middle of December

[K-Rino]
So we jumped on the back of A.C. Chill's truck
Riding full speed and both of the wheels stuck
Time to pack up, load the Mac up
Went to Hiram Clarke and scooped Greek for some back-up

[Greek]
The only one drafted from hard hitting Hiram Clarke
Strapped, under my arm is a rabies infested shark
Jumped in the truck, now we headed back to South Park
It's up to me to keep this shit from spreading to Hiram Clarke
Made out a plan to stop every man in cold blood
Cop in a ____ stand drowning in the rhyme blood
Riding down Reed Road, that's when we seen them coming, shit
Nothing but lip syncers, we slaughtered their ass quick
Synchronized my watch to see how fast I can be, quick
To go against the Greek they got the mind of a flea tick
Try by the mic and die by the mic says it all
My last words with eighty gats pointed at me, "Fuck y'all!" [Gunshot]

[K-Rino]
K.O. was knocking out suckers
Nip was jumping off buildings clothes-hanging motherfuckers
I told them both to run fast
The terrorists showed up with both their faces in one mask
Grimm and Egypt-E showed up
They rode up in their ride, hit the breaks and it blowed up
Some suckers tried to get some
Here come The Beholder, I told him to bring the bomb

[The Beholder]
K-Rino, you know I got 'em
So let's beat 'em down and drop them cause I don't give a fuck about 'em
As I stalk the streets of South Park
I'm ripping rappers apart cause dead men don't talk
You up against a bad guy who's up to no good
And this man wears a hood
So when I step up, step back
Cause I'm fully prepared to go all out cause I'm all that

[K-Rino]
I ran over to a phone to call C-Rock
Stepped in the booth, tried to break but the door was locked
Yo, and the place filled with gas, Ganksta Nip broke the glass
And pulled me out before it choked my ass

[Ganksta Nip]
What's up, K? What's up with you?
The seven serial psychopath South Park psycho to the rescue
You aight? Wake it up
And just for that I finna start fucking the country up
Piece by piece, a limb by limb
The night is dim, to live chances are very slim
Ganksta Nip, the Lord of Darkness
Now I lay me down to sleep in my holy South Parkness
