[Intro]
True soldier stay the same, alone or with his regiment
40000 Gang, 92i
All big is said
Well yeah Morray
Kalash, Kalash

[Chorus (x2)]
True soldier walk alone
True soldier kill you alone
I fell good with my family
When yours are preparing your mourning (Kalash!)

[Verse 1 - Benash]
Thanks to 92i, soldier in khaki fatigues
Should fuck everything in this rap
That's what Yahia told us
Kilos of shit weed in the block
Jean dropped as L.A.S
Why so much contempt?
We are talking about war?Cause that's we lives
Brawl juice in bag
Pow, pow, snitch, you hit the bag (Ouch, ouch, ouch!)
More military than mercenary
I'm standing you're covered (Kalach!)


[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Booba]
150 po-po-pounds, 2 times
'm buildin' weapons for the soviets
Crime time on my Audemars
I'll to go the hookers only for beurettes
L'll go to the hookers only for beurettes
Fuck your green apple tobacco
Boulbi re-squa, Kopp'zer
I'm pretty dark, I'm Chez Colette
They're restless I got rifles, glasses
Bills violets (izi!)
Bla-black flag, skeleton head
Floats above our heads
Every day it's our party
Your puss-,you pussy, my drop point
Rap game, I have no losses, this son of a bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Daarki]
Freezer told me to shut up
Close your eyes,I shot on yours
Khmer calls me, it's war
East weapond, as Yoda lightsaber
I fuck your mother if you talk bout' my gang
Fuck the wolves, No needs to walkin group
White as Walter White
Second option, if the rap makes you waiting
Fuck the Cold War we ain't pretend
Bang bang I blow you by guidance of Jimmy
A true soldier can walk alone
With or without weapons, my niggas can take your life
