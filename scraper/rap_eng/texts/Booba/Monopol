Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower
But it's "fuck the world", get a child out her
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothing 'bout her
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers
I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour
Married to the game but she broke her vows
That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
And my night stands are full of open Bibles, ugh
I think about more than I forget
But I don't go 'round fire expecting not to sweat
And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg
Money outweighing problems on the triple beam
I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes
Be good or be good at it
Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic
Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's "fuck what they say"
I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away, man, I come down in a couple of days
OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode
I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G code
It's Weezy motherfucker, Blood gang and I'm in bleed mode
All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole
So you can keep knockin', but won't knock me down
No love lost, no love found

[ayoub and twz ]
It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now
You kicked me when I was down
But what you say just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more)
That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you
Bitch you get (no love)
You show me nothing but hate
You ran me into the ground
But what comes around goes around
I don't need you (don't hurt me)
You (don't hurt me no more)
That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you
You get (no love)
Bitch you get (no love)
And I don't need you
Get 'em

[Verse 2: ayoub]
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life
I can, see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen
I'm a little bit sicker than, most
Shit's finna get thick again
They say the competition is stiff
But I get a hard dick from this shit, now stick it in
I ain't never giving in again
Caution to the wind, complete freedom
Look at these rappers, how I treat 'em
So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em
They call me a freak cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em
Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage
Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him
Snatch the mic from 'em, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute
Yeah that rap was tight
But I'm 'bout spit the greatest verse of all time
So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um
Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit
And start over from scratch and write new ones
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
You can see the sparks from hot metal
Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game
My soul started to rot, fellow
When I'm not even in my harshest
You can still get roasted cause Marsh is not mellow
'til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop
I'm standing on my Monopoly board
That means I'm on top of my game
And it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore
When you're so good that you can't say it
Cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore
People just get sick cause you spit
These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore
And you can never break my stride
You'll never slow the momentum at any moment, I'm 'bout to blow
You'll never take my pride, killing the flow, slow venom
And the opponent is getting no mercy, mark my words
Ain't letting up, relentless, I smell blood
I don't give a fuck: keep giving 'em hell
Where was you when I fell and needed help up
You get no love
