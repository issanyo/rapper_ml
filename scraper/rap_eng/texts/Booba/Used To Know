You should follow me
Follow me
Follow me oh yeah
The realest around here
They talk shit
They don't know about me

But you ain't the same girl that I used to know
You are alone now
We have a lot of catching up to do
We are alone now
There's nobody around if I'm calling you
We are alone now
You working too much you should come thru
We are alone now

Talking bout my past
But a nigga still the same and I ain't the last
Now you telling me you got that feeling too
We are alone now
Now we now we popping bottles oh you
Drop it drop it low like there's only you
Drive a nigga crazy like there's only you
Get your bitch and then we do it like it's me plus two
Got me coming through out of nowhere

You should follow me
Follow me
Follow me
The realest around here
They talk shit
They don't know about me

But you ain't the same girl that I used to know
You are alone now
We have a lot of catching up to do
We are alone now
There's nobody around if I'm calling you
We are alone now
You working too much you should come thru
We are alone now

Now you telling me u got that feeling too
We are alone now
