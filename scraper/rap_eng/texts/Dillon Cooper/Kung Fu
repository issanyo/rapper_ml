[Intro]

Are we Good?

My Microphone’s on and Shit right?

Oh, its recording...

Right now

You know what i’m saying?

[Verse 1]

I said I got
Two Checks on
The Left and Right like Nike
A lot of dudes I don’t know claiming that they don’t like me
Fight Me
Clean Cut and I’m Sharper than a razor blade
Since Razor days
Line me up and Watch these niggas
Catch a Fade
Get cash Fast
Give them Whiplash
You Hear right?
They Left out
Mad Know they know theyll never make it
Style you can
But the bars you know
You’ ll Never Fake it
Dont get it mistaken
Looks deceiving em and
Staring in they Faces
Carlos Santana Im Jingo
Django unchained
Showing No Love
To No Smuts
They Want Mine
They Want This
Shorty Know she want me
Disrespectful Dreadful Potential
Ain't None Of these Niggas
Be Fucking with my credentials
Experimental Shit Like Hendrix with the Wah-Wah
Purple Haze Marijuana
Teen Spirit Like Nirvana
Loving This Cantata,Moonlight Sonata
Colombiana Mami know she want this Anaconda
From the city thats home of the ROC
BROOKLYN nigga
Home of Big POP
Never trusting NO cops FOREVER
I-V-Double-X-Cetera
Born Better-a
El Professional
Homie, catch my Style
Rolling the Loud
We Go Pound for Pound
I got white boys out in Cali that be smoking me out
Get your baby momma wet
But with you, its a drought
You peep the Steelo
And KNOW im bout that

[Verse 2]

I said I had to drop a mixtape, cause my shit Great
Whoever tries to knock me off failing
Theyre learning that they making mistakes
Physical LightWeight
But Mentally Im Heavy yo
A dynamo
ADD tried to Prescribe me ADDERAL

In gym class I watched bitches playing Volleyball
Puerto Rican Cuties got Twitter names with an Underscore
Olé I say and I just teased em like a Matador
Taking Names
Exploring em
You could say i’m building rapport
Other niggas not
Two equals
Isosceles
Middle Fingers Up
Thats the PAC in me
Get into your head with the Psychology
Subconsciously niggas is bitches
Nowadays they Gossipy

Tired of the hypocrisy

Take A Picture, it’ll last longer
