[Verse 1]
Yo, for those who don't know
I rhyme swift don't lack gust though (?)
Act up before you get lost in a scuffle
Floating like a bumblebee that Ali shuffle
Right hook, left jab, hit 'em, that one two I do
Check the rhyme my body hot feel the vine
These phonies smoking that reggie I'm steady toking the fine
Got a Cali connection who's buddha better than ever
Puffing on magic dragon and setting off a rocket ship of illustrations
Look me in the eyes I know they hating blatant
Try to clown me 'cause I got a thing for roller blading
It's complex but it shows he's busting stress
'Cause they know the kid is depth
Killing the rhyme fest and mic checks
Got them in the street niggas is rushing to sign checks, yes
Never the less I'll never settle for less (yo)
Sharp like a pencil even when I'm blunt
That's why the ladies love me and they texting me for lunch
You know girls love Beyonce think they running the world
Ain't no half stepping direction, no time for dumb little girls
Like them women with asses is looking nice in some denim
She got a b-line to go jump on my pogo, going loco
Know the kid is about to stack
And she ain't trying to get them frequent flyer miles from JFK to LAX flying coach yo
Titty bopping and i'm rocky
Never stopping jump one time, hip hopping right

[Hook]
This is regular everyday life in my mind (in my mind)
In the world that I'm living
Everyday life is the same old thing
Trying to get my name up and so I'll be king
And I'm on
I'm getting blown in the zone
This is regular everyday life in my mind
In the world that we live in
Everyday life in my mind

[Verse 2]
Change up like metamorphoses
Animorphs and shit
Writing and i'm recording shit like big got some doors to kick
Wide open my eyes closed
Seeing through the vision that I'm getting no times up mix your remedies
Its the excellence niggas is manifesting
Stressing getting to heaven  for sinners is it they destiny
Mentally don't believe my mind straight
I've been corrupted by empire state
The way i move reflection of the hustle
Get cash mentality wishing to get some clarity spitting to vent it out no a/c
Double-O P
Everybody recognize that i'm running and gunning and coming for heads
Heat the game until there's nothing left
Go go gadget
Mr. Superman but my cart can't flow though
Bad chick in Manolo's
Carrie Fisher, I'm Mr. Bigs
You want me to bring the ring in more like Frodo
You know though
Coop killer thriller i'm much iller than all these niggas i'm showin glowin smokin on this potent right
You know I'm killin the mic i'm the wintergreen minty fresh kid roll up in the lexus
Peace god you know you can't tec this
Bladin down in chelsea and im bustin out backflips
Ten stacks rubber banded under my mattress i got this
Killer coop bold as an axe is

[Hook]
