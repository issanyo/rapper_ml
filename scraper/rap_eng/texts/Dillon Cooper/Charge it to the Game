[Verse 1]
Yo, pull up in the candy-painted Caddy and I'm feelin' gold
New York City daily chiefin', we smoke like some Seminoles
Never do I ever put that pussy on a pedestal
Get it wet and let it rain
Say I'm cold, I let it snow
Momma told me count my money
Two times just to double check
If it's short you're catchin' wreck
Judo chop you in your neck
R-A-D, we be the set
No time for pseudo fools, yo
Yep, my aura glowin', you magnetized to my lavish soul
That's protocol if you didn't know, you foolish ho
Dash just copped 2 bottles of that Dusse so we finna go
You feel me, bro?
Got a zippy for the low of that ook, my guy
Indigo soul, don't fuck with the blow
Furious and you sus then you food, my guy
Real shit, you feel me?
Got a bad bitch that I met on tour
Suck my dick real good, grow her own weed
Understand her role, know to keep it low-key
Bottom bitch, eyes of the world
Fuck that nigga, got eyes on your girl
That's that pimp shit boy, you Elliot Spitzer
I own yo' bitch, call me Jason Itzler

[Chorus]
Charge it to the game
If I took her, I ain't meant to
I ain't tryna wife her up
I just call her when I need to
Charge it to the game
I ain't pay for half the shit I'm wearin'
Lookin' niggas always staring
Man, I still ain't never caring
Charge it to the game, woah, woah, woah, woah
Yo, charge it to the game, woah, woah, woah, woah
Said, charge it to the game, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, you don't even know

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move they lips
Some foolish shit
I just play it cool, like Ferris Beuller kid, uh
Boom I'm the bomb, 'bout to blow this shit up
Tell her break it down, shawty roll that shit up
Weed smoke, sour diesel
Eyes low, got me looking like a chino
Royal 1s kicks, I'm a king
Asian shawtys named Ming
Ball up nigga, my jeans is Balmain
Since day one I been off the chain
Catch that fade if you want
Come correct, my uppercut attention deficit
Stone cold stunner, 3:16
Give them nightmares, niggas wish they had dreams
WuTang Told me get the cream proper
Brooklyn niggas, style of a shotta
Cooper nigga, Crown Heights, killa gotcha
Got them hiding all they bitches in the closet
Telling their man that it's girls night
But she's in my crib my gettin' it poppin'
She's a nympho, all she need is that Indo
You feel me, bruh?
She love me cause I'm R-A-D
Lungs green off that THC
Niggas know I stay F-L-Y 'til I D-I-E
Raptors on my chest, that P-H-C
Steeze O-D
Young Zeus, G-O-D
Super Saiyan off that smoke, I go D-B-Z
Coop killa, told y'all that I got the key
Break banks down, niggas ain't stoppin me
Pay up

[Chorus]
Charge it to the game
If I took her, I ain't meant to
I ain't tryna wife her up
I just call her when I need to
Charge it to the game
I ain't pay for half the shit I'm wearin'
Lookin' niggas always staring
Man, I still ain't never caring
Charge it to the game, woah, woah, woah, woah
Yo, charge it to the game, woah, woah, woah, woah
Said, charge it to the game, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, you don't even know

[Outro]
Man, this shit is straight lightweight
You know what I'm sayin'?
We go global
Europe, Asia, Japan, where we at man?
All my niggas all bein' RAD
Spray paint that shit, R-A-D
Ridiculous And Driven, motherfucker
