(Hahaha)
Yo
Nowadays, people think they know my game
Just because they follow me up on the 'gram like the C.I.A
Ridiculous insane
Peep game, then make assumptions on your whole life, like they know ya
First off I was born in October
10/20/1992, Black mother gave birth to a soldier
In a jacked world full of poachers
Eating off the culture like vultures
Dark night, living in a world full of jokers
Counterfeit friendships, forced me to lead the life of a loner
Real recognize, real but I've come across a whole lot of posers
Mediocre music getting promoted
What the fuck I gotta do to get exposure?
Maybe good look, I got irish in my blood
But I'd rather sit and roll me  up like a four leaf clover
Smoke it, get me high like supernova
Astrophysical meteor showers of lyrical visuals asteroid resin on MY-MY-MY gamma 11'z, I gotta stay fresh
Crossed the threshold, took one step
Straight into the valley of death

DRUGS, Rock and Roll Sex
DRUGS DRUGS, Rock and Roll Sex

No rest on a roll, one city to the next
Got an ex in Freiburg, got an ex in Paris
2 years with both I never met their parents
I told them I wasn't their average guy
And at this point in my life
I wanted to live it like I'm Bob Marley
Mentally there when I'm with em
But when I'm away, I'm emotionally pardoned
Didn't mean to break your hearts, yo I'm sorry
Seriously, For a minute I was guilt ridden
Cause I didn't want nobody looking at me
Like I'm heartless
But I said "Fuck that", Word to "2Pac";
"Im a 'G', Till the day I'm gone", That's regardless
Flying and spinning an Orbital Switch 1440
Like Henrik Harlaut
That's how I B-Dog CASABON
They're gonna be inspired by this black Tanner Hall

I'm a one man wrecking crew
Fucking armada
Slaughter
That's word to my unborn son and my daughter
AJ and Meadow, black Tony Soprano
Wife is a brown skinned Carm, pray to god every single day
I'm on this Earth, that I put on for the fam', put that food on the table
Swear that I'm ready, God willing and able
Capable, Unbreakable, I'm sacred, catch the fallen angel
Inspirational

Let 'em see that anything's attainable
Everything but your soul's irreplaceable
Don't ever let nobody try to take it, (uh)

We're made from the stars living G.O.D.S
Kill the negativity cause you don't need stress
Cold sweats in a dark room, days past now
Warrior mentality, this fighter never back down
Focus, watch the pain fade to the background, (yup, yup)
Every single thing you lost, coming back now, (yup, yup)
Everyone that left you hanging, coming back round
Let 'em keep chasing, have 'em runnin' laps now
Back in the days, it was ''Run Forest Run''
But Forest done won the race now Son-Son
I'm shining and blinding em castin' my light on the darkness
Will not be defined by my hardships
Simba will never be scared cause my poppa Mufasa
My soul luminated by stardust
Halley's Comet here in human form
But still growing forming, I'm a protostar
Alpha Omega, from the beginning to the end
I tell you that ''I am a god''
Divine with the rhymes that's inside of my mind
The Coop, almighty blessed, yo the ill one I'm prime
Glowin' and showin' my fire blazing, emotions
The testimony is real, you feel it inside of ya bones
Shakin' it's unmistaken, I'm takin' what's mine
Feel like I'm back from the dead, arisen awake from the tombs

Resurrection, New direction
Refreshing inception, a blessing
Failures ain't nothing but lessons
And heaven just trying to send you a message
