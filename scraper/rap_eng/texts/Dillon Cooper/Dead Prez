[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
My mental only seeing W's
Don't doubt it, cause the truth is right in front of you
As clear as day that I'm stunting and y'all don't want it
I'm cold blooded, murderous, I'mma dope hunter
I count my stacks in a padded room like I'm your buddy
Straight up, my temper hot, I cool it down tremendously
Can't jeopardize my life and end up with a sentence B
More better than most are clever
I never let no niggas touch my cheddar
Always remember what Hov said
They hate a nigga loving his life
Never forget the day I got that call that October night
Turn on the news and see three niggas shot, but one lost his life
My homie caught the bullets meant for y'all, this shit just ain't right
A pallbearer on my eighteenth birthday, yeah it changed me
I ain't Drake, but I'm telling y'all, nothing was the same G
Furthest thing from perfect, motherfuckers never loved us
Coop kill 'em with some tusk and leather on the come up, what?
Rolling marijuana when and where I wanna get high and faded
Ain't ever jaded, I'm wide awake and niggas mad
Y'all ain't never make it
And no debating my legacy gon' be celebrated in every nation
I'm elevated, you bitch, red life the fuck up
Crown heights the fuck up
Till the dumb schmucks [?] with no remorse
I'm showing off, they say that if you got it, you flaunted
Well I got it, I'm stacking precedence
Y'all niggas just want it

[Hook: Dillon Cooper]
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for pounds to represent me (Right?)
I'm out for all these fucking presidents to represent me

I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for pounds to represent me (Say what?)
I'm getting euros, stacking up cheech (Right?)
I'm out for all these fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse 2: A La $ole]
I'm out for presidents to represent me
Hustling, shooting for the stars like a movie
Nobody could fuck with my team, because yours truly
But snap a chicken nigga neck into another two piece
Do we have an understanding, when life play cards
I throw em back like gambit
The shit that I've been going through, they couldn't manage
Eating, but stay hungry
Look how my clan is, forty-seven manners
Make a nigga vanish off the planet once I blam it
Do my damage, I racked up and then I ran it
Bombs over Baghdad, I blast that
M16's with six teens that's worth M's
Why would you ever want the plot to worsen
In the presence of a God, you committed the worst sin
That's blasphemy, uh my trigger working
My blindfolds, so its curtains where my words then
Like manslaughter in chronological order
Crossed four portals with four mortars
Turned sons to granddaughters
Size from the stars like Taurus,  your last one
They finna blow up like a Muslim, promised virgins in the morning
No mourning for the time being
Didn't smoke, but my highness is my being
I'm being everything you not uh
You can never stop son, I shine like the British empire
You cannot run
