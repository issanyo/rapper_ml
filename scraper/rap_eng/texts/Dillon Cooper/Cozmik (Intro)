[Intro]
Welcome, to Cozmik
It's been a while coming right?

[Verse]
Dedication, to everything that I've created
Embark in this journey of life because I'll die some day
Lyrics so skillfully written I call them hyroglyphics
Niggas ain't ready, swear to God they ain't ready for me
The road to glory's a battlefield full of frenemies
College sponsored tours and you get it because you're a necessity
Nobody throwing you paper because they ain't paying
And they racking up the sales because of the videos that you're making right?
I've got to keep it in the back of my mind
No college shit or sponsorship is going to fuck up my grind
Niggas mention my name just trying to get their relevance up
Hit my twitter, instagram just to get another look at my life
Think it's cool and all you high and you fly
But they don't see that it's a problem when your pockets are dry
Got it smoking, spending every bit of bread to provide
For a little bit of weed you're going to burn for a while
Try to burn away the pain of thinking that you really fucked up
Yeah I know I did, I guess I just ran out of luck
Dumb nuts Charlie Conway my ducks must be victorious
When it's smoking the dust, storing it up
