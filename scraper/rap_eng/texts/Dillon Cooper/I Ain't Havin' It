[Verse 1]
Straight out the cut, no such being as I
Picture me live and direct I'm always seeing
No blindspots, walk around town with no crutch
Buzzer beater, I'm clutch
I got the heater meter than Eddie Haskell
When he used to pump the beaver, that's real
Take a girl like candy from a baby how that feel?
Cellphone ringing OD
Honey's love the kid and that's the truth
Come correct or else you'll see the deuce deuce
Pockets fat like Bruce Bruce
It's light work, how you feel now?
Ripping and twisting, flip the game back now with that real sound
Am I lying when I say that niggas die for fame? (nope)
Am I lying when I say dudes is dying for J's?
It's a war right now, amber alert give me medication
People live in anguish trying to just stay elevated
For heaven's sakes celebrate cause life's a bitch and then you die
Get high cause we about to get live

[Hook]
No time for BS, I ain't havin' it, yo fuck that shit
Chill I don't need stress, you can have that shit
Cause I'm just trying to cut like these checks
I don't need the bullshit and chill with all the BS
No time for BS, I ain't havin' it, yo fuck that shit
Chill I don't need stress, you can have that shit
Cause I'm just trying to cut like these checks
I don't need the bullshit and chill with all the BS

[Verse 2]
My fam in London say I don't got time for all the banter
Kill you slowly with the flow that's been compared to cancer
Thinking in the benz, for all the hate appreciate
That's how I know I'm doing something right behind this mic
Pick up the pen I'm writing writing and I'm smoking chiefing reefa
Believe I'm unbelievable, not even at my peak you see
I may be blinded by facade's in your eyes
Victims of the lies they tell, portray they are who they not
That's how it happen sometimes
You dudes be buggin' out like looney toons
That's known facts
Busting techs in your back, warfare
Wake up in the morning and don't know what you're going to deal with
But I know that I don't got no time for that
The time goes by
And then the high goes by
The Fugees singing 'Oh la la la'
Trying to touch the sky
Without closing my eyes
But sometimes I've got to close them
The world we living in don't got know choice I've got to smoke
Toke and take a whiff of reality and gradually I'm going to reach my goals
Financially unstable but trust me that shit is seasonal
Teasing out until I retire
Never going to stop
Possibly the recent rock cause I'm the reason to rock
I'm the reason they rap
I'm the reason niggas trying to stay fresh
Keep it funky all the g's to the left

[Hook]
No time for BS, I ain't havin' it, yo fuck that shit
Chill I don't need stress, you can have that shit
Cause I'm just trying to cut like these checks
I don't need the bullshit and chill with all the BS
No time for BS, I ain't havin' it, yo fuck that shit
Chill I don't need stress, you can have that shit
Cause I'm just trying to cut like these checks
I don't need the bullshit and chill with all the BS

[Verse 3]
Yo what's the word huh?
Roll the doobie next
Steady getting cash kid
Roller blades and fashion
Next to homies who done niggas with the deuce now
True style addiction
Addicted with the first bite
It was love at first sight
Slim waste, nice smile, ass was a nice shape
Sip wine and dine great
Sex all the time
But your friends the annoying chicks all up in your ear
Get your vision blurry when the road was crystal clear
Straight shooter, Kobe fade away to all the haters
Emancipate yourself from mental slavery, seen better days
Go by, flowed on, need some motivation
So, what did I do?
Said I surprised them with this knife cutting, stabbing shit like daggers
I'd like a chick with nice lips who be moving it like Jagger
Fine up in a swimsuit, even banging in pyjamas
Got the body of a mermaid like she grew up in Atlantis
Shorty said the kid is fresher than a box of pampers
Shitting on my competition, oh now they bound to listen
Sitting waiting wishing, anticipate the hate, but I don't violate
I'm bound to hear their bullshit and their propositions
Top listing, meaning that I'm coming up
Twenty years old and I honestly don't give a fuck

[Hook]
No time for BS, I ain't havin' it, yo fuck that shit
Chill I don't need stress, you can have that shit
Cause I'm just trying to cut like these checks
I don't need the bullshit and chill with all the BS
No time for BS, I ain't havin' it, yo fuck that shit
Chill I don't need stress, you can have that shit
Cause I'm just trying to cut like these checks
I don't need the bullshit and chill with all the BS
