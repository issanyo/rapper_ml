She don't want Tom and don't want Dick
She not phased by Harry and don't need Rick
She doesn't care if you're handsome or dressed to kill
The only man that she wants is me, Mr Bill

I'm Mr Bill, big shoes to fill
With me you can't stay still
Because for me the women freak and some men kill

I buy what she wants, even time and friends
And I help her to keep up with the style and trends
I keep a [?] on her back, a spoon on her nose
If there's a place she wants to be I'll make sure that she goes

I'm Mr Bill, big shoes to fill
With me you can't stay still
Because for me the women freak and some men kill

I got no competition, love is second to me
I'm number one priority
I'll make you rob, cheat, lie and steal
Because nothing in the world can make you feel like

Mr Bill, big shoes to fill
With me you can't stay still
Because for me the women freak and some men kill

No clothes and no fly
No drugs and no high
And no car key girl and no TV
And no fun, no nothing if you ain't got me
I'm Mr B.I.L.L, what's that spell girl? Mr Bill

I've wanted you from the first day that I saw you
But baby I'll be damned if I pay for you
'Cause if sex was all I wanted, I'd get a pro
And your value is much greater than even you know
You must not think much of yourself if you can be bought
No amount is too much, you sell yourself short
'Cause I got more to offer than material things
That precious little feeling that sweet love brings

Ay yo baby don't you listen to him, he's a joke
And only telling you that stuff because he's broke
He can do nothing for you, he's just fun of it
And baby being with him, you just don't benefit
I can support your habits, your wants, and needs
You need someone who writes instead of someone who reads
Your girls will be jealous, it's you they envy
Not because you're with him but because you're with me

No fun and no party
No one and nobody
And no time, person, place or thing
Can make you feel like me because I'm devastating
Nothing that we can't do, no one we can't control
I'll buy you anything, including a soul
You don't need love, friends or a family
I'll buy you all new ones so baby just come with me
I'm Mr B.I.L.L, what's that spell? Mr Bill
Give it to me Mr B.I.L.L, what's that spell? Mr Bill
Now all the ladies Mr B.I.L.L, what's that spell? Mr Bill
Now everybody Mr B.I.L.L, what's that spell? Mr Bill
