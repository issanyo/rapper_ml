[Intro: Dillon Cooper, Allen Iverson]
We talkin' about practice
We talkin' 'bout practice man
We talkin' about practice
We talkin' about practice
We ain't talkin' 'bout the game
We talkin' about
Yo
Practice man

[Verse 1]
Fresh to death, man
Was swaggin' like a veteran
Somethin' like I'm dapper than
Loafers and Centella pants
Bring a date, boom ban dan, this weed hittin' good
Red hairs like Peter Pan
Floatin' off to Neverland
Takin' trips, Instagram flickin', they see me movin'
How your education? Cop this shit for free, I pick and choose em'
Shit is solid on the East side, we wylin', swoopin', cruisin'
W's you seein' clearly, we ain't ever losin
Incredible is how I'm feelin' when I'm in the zone
Bad as Michael Jackson, but notorious like Al Capone
Homie it's my time to grind, I'm Morris Day, I'm Jess Sherone
Celly go to voicemail cuz I'm faded, yeah I'm hella gone
That's every day collecting pounds and peso's with my J's on
International, factual, that they gun and hate on
Throwin' shade, my name be all up in they conversation
Cool balls, like Roger Rabbit, straight up animation
Fabricatin' all your reputations
How you 'sposed to be a sergeant, but your man is who you emulatin'?
Pump the brakes before I detonate you, now you sweatin'
Count your blessings, come correct, and be correct at any second
Know your facts before you hit the net with information
My limitations non-existent, must've missed it
Cuz my curveballs 90 miles, swervin' all the speculation
No comparison, my flow embarrass dudes in every nation

[Interlude: Allen Iverson]
I'm the MVP
I'm the MVP of this league
The best, the best, I'm the MVP of this league
I know I'm supposed to be there, I know I'm supposed to lead by example
I know that, and I'm not, I'm not shoving it aside
You know, like it don't mean anything
We talkin' about practice man

[Verse 2]
Iverson up in this bitch, I'm 'bout the game, fuck is practice?
Lame niggas imitate but never match this
Post your weak tape up on Datpiff
I'm high watchin' Southpaw, y'all fools straight catfish
Flyer than your average savage
True blues on my feet with red bottoms, now that's BK lavish
Doin' things that I used to imagine
From smokin' with the boo in Germany and fuckin' bitches in Paris
Now every label couldn't bag this shit
But now I count on nine and Billy chillin' automatically
Auto comeback, combatible, 'proach the gun with anatomy
Zero gravity, float away, had to stake up the gravity
Fuck her graphically cuz I hired my faculty
Level waitin' in jail, and doctorates sporadically
And we got telepathic burners taking casualties
Stop you in your tracks, rip out your batteries
Only spittin' facts, fuck if you mad at me

[Outro: Allen Iverson]
I know it's important
I do, I honestly do
But we talkin' 'bout practice, man
What are we talking 'bout?
Practice? We talkin' 'bout practice, man
We talkin' about practice
We talkin' about practice
We ain't talkin' about the game
We talkin' about practice, man
Not the game that I go out there and die for, and play every game like it's my last
Not the game, we talkin' 'bout practice, man
