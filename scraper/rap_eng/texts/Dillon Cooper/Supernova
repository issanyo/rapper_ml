[Verse 1]
Sold they souls and now they hollow
Be a leader watch and follow
Man I got some questions, answers might be hard to swallow
Lone ranger desperado road to El Dorado

On the surfs with gold situations gon' unfold
Friends gon' turn to foes but I don't take it personal
People gonna hurt you - true - is this inevitable?
Gotta keep it buzzin' 'cause it's something that I know

[Chorus]
Only way is up
Movin' forward
Watch the sky illuminate supernova
Radiate, feel the glow
Boom, explode, now you now the star is born

[Verse 2]
I went down to the crossroads solo when found myself on my knees crying
Had my hands on the floor and got nowhere to go I just felt like dying
My girl left me, no explanation, so confused - what did I do?
So I pick my guitar up, put my hands on the frets and start playing them blues

Said rain rain, let the pain go away
Talk about another day
All I wanna do is see my life change
Thunderstruck - and then I woke up
Had a revelation, realized I'm the one that gotta go for me and my own luck

[Chorus]
Only way is up
Movin' forward
Watch the sky illuminate supernova
Radiate, feel the glow
Boom, explode, now you now the star is born

Still we up
Movin' forward
Watch the sky illuminate supernova
Radiate, feel the glow
Boom, explode, now you now the star is born

[Verse 3]
Focus
Know it's real when you're called into the field with the --- chosen
Break moles, navigating through a maze of emotions
Control the commotion that's unknown like the bottom of the ocean
Do it, feels like kickin dope in and I don't give a fuck if it's broken

Turn up with 'em up then it goes in
Comin' from my spot, black leather, six plays like I'm Logan
I'm that war buddy stars 'cause the force been awoken
I'm a speak beak that's spoken
Best tellin on the get-down fast I was born to be a showman

Stepped on the stage first time I was five years old with a dream
Mama told me everything that good isn't golden everything good ain't clean
But I believe in scene ma, destiny was written I coud have my whole seat up. Brought to the people a born leader

[Bridge]
Focus
You know it's real when you're called to the field with the chosen
Break moles navigating through a maze of emotions
Control the commotion, It's unknown like the bottom of the ocean

[Chorus]
Only way is up
Movin' forward
Watch the sky illuminate supernova
Radiate, feel the glow
Boom, explode, now you now the star is born

(1, 2, 3, break it down)

[Outro]
Still we up
Further call
So high up and spinning for the goal
Radiate, feel the glow
Boom, explode, now you now the star is born

Only way is up
Movin' forward
Watch the sky illuminate supernova
Radiate, feel the glow
Boom, explode, now you now the star is born
