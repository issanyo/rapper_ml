[Part 1]
Stereo sound symphonic
Crazy demonic like the Walking Dead
I'm slaying all these zombies call me
Deuces Romney, faster than automatics and cooler than auto rockets
Stepp in my albums and sippin redbull with gin and tonic
Back in 06 is when I lost control
98 was the last time that my name was ever on the honor roll
I honored all the greats and posters hanging on my wall and thats a fact
I promise to make history after that, you feeling that?
I strive to be a Martyr, part of the [?]
Spitting my lines so dirty homies we chuckin diseases
Make 'em supply a piece of statement and give me they reasons
Words that I'm speakig got some wizardry
Magical entities, lifted me, get a tender rollie into me
Sexing her mentally, it appears to be that I'm getting respectedly the best

[Hook]
Who's best, you step no contest, yes
Mess with me, see no progress next
Whos best, you can't accomplish this
Next election, cause you are less
Who's best, you step no contest, yes
Mess with me, see no progress next
Who's best, you can't accomplish this
Next election, cause you are less

[Part 2]
I get the room packed like special earth balls, fucking earth balls
Slipsy, burning, turning to cycle the life
Trouble since  highschool, [?]  like Michael, but knock you out like Tyson do
Sit like a rabbit, pit infected with the swine flu, [?]
Had a calling for the microphone, I remind you
Word to bible, not every person gonna like you
They spiteful, even Jesus got betrayed by disciples
We might go relaxin, askin me where I be
They say that I'm missing in action
No satisfaction, to satisfy them and give 'em reaction
[?] and the crazy contractions
I trappin the reats and I clap 'em
Recognize, I dont play that shit, no subliminals
I point and shoot, and I aim that shit for real
It's an amazing task to battle with success
I never gave a fuck, but now I give a fuck who's best

[Hook]
Who's best, you step no contest, yes
Mess with me, see no progress next
Whos best, you can't accomplish this
Next election, cause you are less
Who's best, you step no contest, yes
Mess with me, see no progress next
Who's best, you can't accomplish this
Next election, cause you are less
