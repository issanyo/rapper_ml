Updated all my stats, my breath smellin' like similac

Can tell by our friendly chat, you're up for the milky wax

These notes will ignite you, my chest hair will entice you

Before the night is done, we'll have lots of fun

That bouncy way you strut, you sniffed me out the cut

I know you want my stuff, cause my funk is real enough

Sex Panther on the chase, that scent you wanna taste

Pheromones all over the place, got you hot, look at ya face

Know what your wearin' tonight and what it means

Ya know all the nasty thangs it's to bring

Peripherally hittin' me with the mind games

Subliminally lettin' me know that we can play

Got good sense to know the dough's ya God

You'll let me on the field and take the yard

Take this money and buy you, gonna make this money and rob you

Man Funk

And you know that you value it girl

Man Funk

And you know that you value my

Man Funk

The kind of funk that never stops, it's just my

Man Funk

It'll funk you 'til the cradle rocks, it's just my

Man Funk

It'll let you know what sex you are, girl it's just my

Man Funk

It'll take you right up to the stars
