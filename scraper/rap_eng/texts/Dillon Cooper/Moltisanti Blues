[Verse 1]
Yo
Try'na make this music
Feeling like it's Mister Holland's Opus
Almost there but minor setbacks have me losing focus
Cut my hand inside the garden try'na smell the roses
Everything ain't perfect people always got a motive
It seems like
Every time I see the green light
Start seeing red but fake phony start to scheme right
Wrong move, Oh shoo, man I ain't have no clue
Nowadays my old song's sounding like a old blues
B-B King shit's see me
Bum the Stevey Ray inside my room on the CD
Soprano's on the TV, I relate to Tony, yo
Paranoid dreams reminiscence bout the okie-do
Wake up light a cuba man I don't know what I'm doing
Take a day by day cause I ain't try'na live a ruin
Life is what you make it, if you want it gotta take it
So I keep a G that's why I'm motha-fuckin blazing

[Chorus]
Life's a bitch but stay fly
Hater's talk shit but one day they'll die
Keep your head up, roll up and get high
Ain't no need to stress cause things gon' be fine

Life's a bitch but stay fly
Hater's talk shit but one day they'll die
Keep your head up, roll up and get high
Ain't no need to stress cause things gon' be fine

[Verse 2]
Yo
I'm so focused, like I got em put under hypnosis
Coop-califragilous that gets reali-docius
Put it on my notice cause this shit's about to blow bitch
Inner-cellar kozak supernova too explosive
The Wu got the killer-B's but R A D
We just congregating swamp like some motha-fucking locust
Snow it ain't a bluff I'm the god damn coldest
Smoking man you know this where to warm I got the potion
Where's your cup yo, red solo polo
Try'na get faded, yo what's the holdup
Life's so god damn good if you make it
Keep it (Irey bunson Jamaican)
But I been drinking more than I be smokin nowadays
Crack a bottle know my homies gonna spark a haze
Shit they knew man we been doing this since high school
Only difference is we grown now look what time do

[Chorus]
Life's a bitch but stay fly
Hater's talk shit but one day they'll die
Keep your head up, roll up and get high
Ain't no need to stress cause things gon' be fine

Life's a bitch but stay fly
Hater's talk shit but one day they'll die
Keep your head up, roll up and get high
Ain't no need to stress cause things gon' be fine
