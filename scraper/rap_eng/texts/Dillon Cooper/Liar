Listen to them
Children of the night
What music they make

Today, we're gonna speak on the subject of liars
You know, when we think about liars we think about
Cheaters, deceivers, con artists, anything
In that vein but
The main that they have all in common is fear
Just think about it

Liar, liar, pants on fire
Hang your laundry on the wire
Little money in your pocket and some hustling on the game
If you wanna ride free you better find another way
Take it down, better make it down the way you know
Fellas on the left, ladies looking ready to go

Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar

Let me get on this mic real quick
Check it out

Dug yourself in a hole but you can't find a way to get out now
Six feet in the ground, ash to ashes but you can't climb out
They say if it's done in the dark it's gon' come to light
Maybe hidden for a while but rises fully to plain sight
The naked eye won't see it all
Hope they believe it all
You fiending more but when they keep your people you proceed to fall
Turn the other cheek, you hope that you could sleep at all
Wake up in the morning quiet but you dreamed applause
You been smilin' outside but inside you just feel appalled
The devil is a liar, look in the mirror, see the cult
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
Lifestyle contradictive
Said you'd do it for the pleasure, don't care about the business
But I know it ain't my business
So I throw these middle fingers up
Read between my ring and index finger
I don't give a fuck
Liar, liar, tell me what it is you tryna be
I'll listen to your story but promise you ain't foolin' me

Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar

Drama, drama, always acting
Shut them off if no one's watching
Tall tree climbing up to nowhere
Cut the vine and watch it wither
Looking so nice, looking like you're ready to go
Baby if it's on us, maybe let's get ready to go

Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar

So today
We learned about the phonies, the fabricators
You know
The little tricksters out there
We just wanna chill out with all that lyin'
You know what I mean?
Because the truth will set you free
You know what I mean?
You just gon'...
