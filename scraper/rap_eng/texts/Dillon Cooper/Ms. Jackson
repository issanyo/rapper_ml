[Verse 1]
Said I lost you on a Summer day
Maybe it was Fall up in the Winter time
But you would fly, feuds, cause I used to lie
Tied up in a ball with you, a noose around my neck
I'm out of breath, I close my eyes
Try to forget all the the times I had to lie to you repeatedly
Keep you smiling vividly, I hated you and loved you too
Know you fucked them other dudes who claimed that was before me
I don't give a fuck, you gave it up, you funky slut
I said it to your face I know you fucked me up, but
I love you, never another above you
Begging can I plead that I never see your face cause if I do the lips I taste uh
Sweet surrender, two weeks, you lay upon my face, I
Close my eyes cause I don't know how much more I can take
I'm sorry, cause things ain't working out
Surprised you never expected words to bring your mood from North to South
The emotional roller coaster, up and down in circles
I roll zig-zags smoking purple, stupid shit can really hurt you

[Hook]
Go, go, go, away because you're making it hard, you're making it hard for me
I can't sleep, you're a distraction, my mind's reacting, Chemical inbalance
(Ooh) I am for real, never meant to make your daughter cry, I apologize a trillion times

[Verse 2]
I wait for you at Prospect Park
Third car from the stairs, hop on the train
We stare into each others eyes suprised you
So infatuated with my looks
Love for you has grown but years has passed
Yo sexy ass, my lady talking about having my baby
I agree you are the one for me, others beg to differ
You get mad cause I love women, see 'em whenever I'm with you
I ain't mad at you, on the second thought I'm kinda happy
Cause I see that I'm your everything
You don't need a wedding ring I, know you love me
Shit is feeling funny, still don't know if the love is real
It's hurting like Holyfield
Yeah the truth is painful walking with you feeling shameful
Cause I'm smashing what he passed up, nigga's saying I'm gassed up
Pussy got me slowed down and then I'm feeling [that rush?]
Thought I was a king but this ass a peasants hands touched
Now I am a jester, guess who got the best of, me and now I'm stressed out
Hands out, left out
You never loved me, that's something that I told myself
To detonate the feelings I had hiding like Saddam
Feeling covered like kid jobs, you did your job and now you're fired
Flabbergasted cause I smashed her and you saw the pictures
It's because I missed ya, not saying I missed ya
But I'm talking about the time that homie was just all up in ya
Baby girl surrender bow down to the master
Brooklyn boy, Dillon Cooper lucky bastard

[Hook]
Go, go, go, away because you're making it hard, you're making it hard for me
I can't sleep, you're a distraction, my mind's reacting, Chemical Inbalance
(Ooh) I am for real, never meant to make your daughter cry, I apologize a trillion times
