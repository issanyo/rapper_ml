[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
Check
We supply to inspire
Spittin' straight crack, sip the yak, take you higher
My messiah is me, make way for the new god MC
Brooklyn Prince, soon to be reigning king
Facts, you know what I'm saying?
Magnificently elevated Coop-Supreme
Sayin', flee in supreme
So You know what I mean
Spiritual bombs like, lemme mix the potion
Keep the steam rollin' self propelled like locomotion
From the county of Kings, 718/347 shit
Disrespect our bullies that'll run up on ya relatives
Know a couple locos, UPS these dudes is postal
Don't give 'em incentive, guaranteed we gonna pull through
That's that Brooklyn shit, from Crown Heights to Flatbush
Quick snatch ya chick, ya iPhone, and ya Macbook
What you expect homie? We from NY
So chill wit' all that talk before you see them slugs fly
Guy...

[Hook]
So knuckle up if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing...
So knuckle up if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing...
So knuckle up if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing...
So knuckle up if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing...

[Verse 2]
Yo, I said my dogs don't need to bark, we communicate with telepathy
Smell a rat in the pack, set the trap and off em' like Kennedy
Ain't no discrepancy, my mentality y'all will never get
I like chicks who smoke weed, but grew up doing pirouettes
I got a problem 'cause I love the pussy, keep it gushy
Now I'm eating all the milk and cookies
Give me king dome, wanna be my queen yo
I can't blame her 'cause I gave that ass the whole D yo nigga Zagga-Zow, let me lime and hit the loud
Always cop my fronto from my block without a doubt
Shit is strong, word is bond
Shoutout my brothers A and BB 'cause we going long
Ya feel me? Check it out uh...
A tyrant titan like Tyson
Just motivate and I'm biting
A beast from the east y'all could never defeat
King Cooper, Iron Lion in the jungle of concrete
Dark knight, Gotham City, know where to find me
Nigga What..

[Hook]
So knuckle up if you think you can hang

So knuckle up if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing...
So knuckle up if you think you can hang
And if not then let me do my thing...
