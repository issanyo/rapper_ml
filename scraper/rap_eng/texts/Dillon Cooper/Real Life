[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
Said it's been playin' on my mind like vinyl
I'm bittersweet
You think you won but you had to lose the semifinals
Means you get so close and see your idols
But primal instinct told you hold your pride, that shit is vital
See, I don't ask niggas for pictures man
'Cause maybe if I did I'd have some feats with Cole, Fut, and Jay Electronica
Celebrate like eight days straight that's word to Hannukkah
But word to momma I'ma solve all my monetary problems
Wanna, fuck up some commas and bust in some condoms
And models who poppin' bottles faster than they can pour 'em up
I brought my homies wit' me, blowin' the gas [?]
All that shit's up in here makin' more than us
It's harsh realities but apparently that's how that shit go
Our mood on dismal, want seven zeros before that decimal
I'm always leavin' parties ten minutes after I get there
And I don't even know why I came

[Hook: Dillon Cooper]
Cuz every single time I go out
I tell myself the same thang (tell myself the same thang)
Cuz every single time I go out
I tell myself the same thang (tell myself the same thang)
Yo, why the fuck is you here
These fools don't even know yo' name
And if they do know yo' ass they all say the same thing

[Verse 2: Dillon Cooper]
Turn me up
I got Adderall to focus and Buspirone for anxiety
I told ya'll I ain't perfect the manic depressive dieting
Sound crazy like I'm going major in a minor key
Rap shit holdin' me back feel like I'm playin' in the minor leagues
Man I want the finer things like [?] cash and train fare
Fuck the glamor and glitz homie cuz it ain't there
The only thing around is fake niggas, bitches wit' fake lips
Dudes callin' you bro and fam and smilin' but they ain't shit
The rap game fucked up my credit fucked up even worse
But I'll be good I know 70 billion 'fore I cruise that hearse
I know my worth, so what is yours huh
You sure you wanna be a rapper out on tour huh
You wanna spend your bread on shit you can't afford
Get a thousand likes it feels like it's like some type of award
People talkin' to you they ain't notice you before
Made it to imaginary world so let's explore

[Hook: Dillon Cooper]
Cuz every single time I go out
I tell myself the same thang (tell myself the same thang)
Cuz every single time I go out
I tell myself the same thang (tell myself the same thang)
Yo, why the fuck is you here
These fools don't even know yo' name
And if they do know yo' ass they all say the same thing
