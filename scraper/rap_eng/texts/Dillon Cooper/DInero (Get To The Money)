[Verse 1]

Woke up feelin' like a God
I'm the boss I play my part
Watch 'em fold I lay my cards
Flexin on 'em dropping bombs
Peep my surroundings
Man I'm feeling vibrations around me
What is the energy telling me
Negative force on my enemies
Promise you that I never let it get to me
Demons and [?] I conquer 'em
Yo dodge 'em, less suckers, alot of 'em
Gold diggin' shawtys alot of 'em
If niggas ain't phony I'm proud of 'em
Real ones hard to come by nowadays
Everybody throwin' shade
I'm just trynna break bank and get paid
Warehouse full of money, burn it up
Yea I'm Frank Abagnale catch me if you can
Fell asleep in Brooklyn woke up in Berlin
Tac Suits on Air Max 95's, oh yea
That's flight wear, fly toys Buzz Lightyear
They be rockin' all the hype gear
Yo I just throw on what I like yea
New Thriller, Coop killa
OG smooth criminal like Mike Jack
Motown 25 'bout to make history this is my year
Tell 'em make way for me
The rap game ain't got a thang on me
I do it for my family and dead homies
It's time for the whole world to take notice

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Break it down nigga break it up
Independant they ain't takin' cuts
Don't fuck with many 'cause it's hard to trust
Day ones man it's only us
Yea, sometimes it's hard to remember
But it ain't hard to forget
That's why my [?] load up the biscuit
Strange world that we livin' in
Politicians split the dividence
Trump niggas get they wig pealed
Word to chef Ray man that shit real
Young Wu-Tang nigga coop bang nigga
