[Intro:]
Yeah, yeah
We gotta do what we gotta do to survive out here, right?
It’s that R-A-D game, you know what I’m saying?
It’s Cooper getting’ live

[Verse 1:]
Exclusive young boy steady shining
Flow’s so erratic
Caught the limelights out, undeniable, it’s my right to vibe out
No goons, they always got the 9 out
Cooper killing a while out
To find me who can never ever ever ever predict the sudden addiction
I’m in my kitchen, just chefing up all of my defensive for the opposition
Affirm mission, missionary positions, I’m getting bitches
That mean the kind the mommy pappy she call me from the lobby and trade this here we go
Bitch, it’s my CZO, fuck that, ‘cause I got bills to pay, so where the fuck my deal
I got kicks to buy so I stay fly
Oh me, oh my, I got to shine so these sucker motherfuckers could just hop on on my dick
Middle fingers to the haters and their fucking clicks
I’m the shit, bitch, bitch, I’m the shit
Diarrhea nasty bastard, I got yeezys nigga
So shut the fuck up with them airwalks, moon walk to outer space, I fair walk
Rock, steady rock so, good fella mob star, space jam monstar, got bars
Brooklyn ‘bout to kill the game, not the East West thing respecting on my better rental
Pac to Big
Deblock the kids, I’m a fresh prince, back up, gotta get these stacks up
Stuffing all this cash under my mattress
Blowing all these trees, better believe, come on, get happy like a partridge
I’m a Martian like titties like Dolly Parton
I beg your pardon, please, can you honestly
Look me in the eyes and say that you don’t feel the chills
Coming up the spine, only the strong survive

[Hook]
Ridiculous until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
We living rad until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
Ridiculous until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Verse 2:]
Sharp like thumbtacks and eyes of eagles
Regal elegance blessed, heaven sent [?]
I promise if I tell a lie
I repent and roll up, you, four blunts yo, wow
Chilling out, maxin', relaxing all cool
With the dime piece, sipping on some jack and jill shit, it’s just so exciting
‘Cause I’m RAD, you know me, rocking out a A3C
Just [?], if I’m on the rolling you slow, I gotta go get my rhymes right
You heard that
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t rhyme like this
Some of them try to rhyme, but they can’t
‘Cause we some murderers, cold bloody killers off the beatbox
Street knock hard rock, Van Halen Franky style
Crazy out the fella shine, cool killer gonna be a cruel winner as I’m getting colder with the flow
We get them chills up your spine, spin around like you dreamed about
Sipping on me, they dreaming in, I’m leaving the studio contemplating about movie roles
I’m trying to be the Fresh prince, learned the theme song and I’ve been spitting on their death since
Lock me up and sell the drugs, better checking rob scheme
Dope fiends die for me, girls they be crying for me
I said I’m super sorry, shawty, with all the glory come stories
The nigga just be trying to sell you so police
So I’m a rock, nigga, on the stone
Rocky nigga Im Stallone
Cuba kill ‘em softly like a Fugee time to put ‘em on
Cooper gone

[Hook]
Ridiculous until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
We living rad until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive
Ridiculous until the day that we die
Survival of the fit, only the strong survive

[Outro]
*Yo, it's Cooper*
Um, Dillon Cooper by the way if you ain't know
*Muthafuckin' Crown Heights Killa*
*And it's cut*
Bitch
