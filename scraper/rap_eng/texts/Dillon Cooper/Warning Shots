[Intro]
Warning Shots..

[Verse 1]
Coop Killa, let the name simmer
Hold Dat, rude boy true sinner
Little boy juice be the truth
Pockets stay fat like a nigga Bruce Bruce
Giving you a dose of the groove
Mic check 1-2
Niggas still don't know COOP
Brooklyn nigga. With the tattoos?
Oh that motherfucker rap too?
Yeah nigga I'm that dude
Show up in the cut wit a strut
Nigga get buck
Jazz nigga shit, I be like SO What
Get it? Nah ya niggas ain't wit it
I'm wicked, Oz shit, admit it
All these motherfuckers jock mine
Lil niggas u like they seen a Glock 9
(Doot-Doot)
I JUST KILLED YO ASS
Put em in a ditch dissapear yo ass
RAD nigga
Who'd've thought that I'd eat the game, that's food for thought
Boutta give the game everything it want
Niggas stay gassed but Im nonchalant
2 years when my daddy died
RiP to pops but he smiling down and he good because I'm fine nigga
Style before my time nigga
Grandpa puffed with marley
While touring sippin' bacardi
My circle small an we on it
So my kinfolk cool
When I get rich
My jewels gon' glisten like Mike
Glove and I'll moonwalk
Like a S-M double O T-H Criminal
Chief like A Powhatan
Take a trip out to Maryland
And Get B-More Bent
Turn Up, smoking evergreen in the bean
You heard bruh?
Dorchester to Mattapan
Lawrence niggas my second Fam
But they kno this nigga got Brooklyn roots
I don't fear no nigga
Strait my youte
I changed up when Brian got popped
Trust no nigga gotta watch my back
Always Keep it 1hunna
Im the Radass muhh fucka
Who wan dun uss
Murdered the the boom-BAP
Fuck with the trap
Pay me out front then we leave through back
Fuck a blog cause im bout the money
Fuck her good
Becky bolton
Woo.haw
Bad mon tings
Fronto and some bambu Rollin my trees
Oh please, you can't do the 5Gz
Harlem shake Before 03
Pop a ollie before i a pop a molly
Smoke and rappin my favorite hobby
Skate on all these lames
And these Bitches shouting my name
They just tryna get em some fame
Man I swear these chicks be insane
Poppin' bottles
Bottle poppin'
And Im smilin
Aww man who'd've thought it
Dillon Cooper
Really bout it
God damn I'm a G
Real nigga never stuntin'
Tell them bustaz quit the frontin'
Talk but they ain't Sayin'nothin'

[Chorus]
I'm sending out warning shots..
Better watch yo back

Thinking that they in the top spot...
