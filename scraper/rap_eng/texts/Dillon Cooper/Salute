[Intro]
Calling up the phone
Who is rolling up the dojo

[Verse 1]
Yeah dope crack like customs in Carbonya
Halla when you see me
Call me Copper D.C Presidential
Taking over instrumentals
Like a stick up kid without a mask inside your residential
Yeah I could do that, Yeah I thought it was cool to rap
Lunch tables high school wore ones blue and back
Back when I had Sunya by my side, Ride or Die
She don't talk to me no more
I hope she doing fine
It is crime of a heart breaker
I don't even try to but I do it
Fuck em good I do it
Who knew it uh
Cooper super like a looper, clay boy and I see the future
Laughing to the bank now
Who I got to thank but myself for that
Doubt is so promising
I count them properly
Jocking me, about my style looking like a mockery
Imitation is flattery and motivations label heads peeps
That's why we have negotiation

[Chorus] x2
So say it
Praise be the most
I salute the come up
Get it how I wanna
Anytime I wanna
You already know how it goes
One for the money
Two for the show

[Verse 2]
Time heals wounds you thought would never close
Especially when your new girl look like a centre fold
Texting you x to know but your x's are letting go
Cause you strive for sex and guilt tripping because you let her go
Bitch, It's the cycle of life
Almost made her my wife
If this music ain't popped I'd probably see cops every night
Toxic love is a drug that eats you alive to the core
But steady pussy always bring a nigga back for more
Cut it off because I had to
I'm going city to city
Flavours of women and their friends I've got them good and plenty
Tell em they pretty
Don't love them but love their company in conversation
Fuck up moderation lay it down
Creating memories ?
I remember the rise of fame
As I'm in my conda in LA pouring up the Hennessy
In a position of power because I made it there
So let me make it clear
One time

[Chorus] x2
So say it
Praise be the most
I salute the come up
Get it how I wanna
Anytime I wanna
You already know how it goes
One for the money
Two for the show
