[Verse 1: Dillon Cooper]
It's 'bout to be a state of elevation
Because the underdog is eatin'
'Cause I'm starvin' like I'm Marvin
Yo, emaciated overdose
Ya'll never know the feeling that I get whenever I see the same
Bitches who play Dillon come on Facebook catchin' feelings
I'm appealin' now, they feel the sound
Tryna get a feelin' on my dick so she can stick around
She just think I'm different now
Tatted up, braces gone, tell the bitch leave me alone
Only thing she want is for the kid to fucking take her home
And lay it on the table
Hop in the range, the game is changin' up
Switch it and I'm dangerous
Michael Jackson's angel dust
Pardon me, I'm Harley with these lame MC's that's on me
And I'm jammin' out like Marley
With the bitches blonde as Barbie

[Chorus]
State of Elevation, now I'm levatatin'
Raisin' stakes, it ain't too late
Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud, it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we mothafuckin' blazin'
Hey, we levatatin'
Raisin' stakes, it ain't too late
Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud, it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we mothafuckin' blazin'

[Verse 2]
I said our friendship's sex and party
After sexin' she was textin'
Her best friend ;cause she want next
And Iâ€™m sure she gonna get it
With this modern day Mike Seaver
Martin, she was Gina
Told her Syanora it was really nice to meet ya
Now, it's on to the next one, learned the life lesson
Fuck 'em but don't love 'em so the next day I ain't text 'em
Missed calls by anonymous
Haters wanna try be us
Doo doo doo doo doo, not interested in the politics
The only thing I wanna do is body the game, remember the name
Dillon Cooper the Dark Knight
Brass knuckles and knife fights
Get light and Harlem shake
Coops, time to dominate
The show is on the road
My pockets swollen up, them big bills
Always gotta stay Trill, rad life, pop 'em off
Top spot to knock 'em off, take over like hijackers
Detonation's coming faster
Blowin' up, we mass attackin'
Stevie Wonder, Masta Blasta
Killin' all these wack ass rappers

[Chorus]
State of Elevation, now I'm levatatin'
Raisin' stakes, it ain't too late
Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud, it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we mothafuckin' blazin'
Hey, we levatatin'
Raisin' stakes, it ain't too late
Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud, it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we mothafuckin' blazin'

[Verse 3]
Big up, big up, it's a stick up, stick up
Call the mothafuckin' cops, they don't pick up
I got the ammunition in the system
Making hits, get rich and
Bitches on my dick man, it's sick man, I'm livin' this
It's wicked to wick a bitch, lick a clitoris, I'm feelin' it
Hit a nigga voodoo child, play guitar that Hendrix style
Runnin' shit, Texas Stevie Ray Vaughn
Genghis Khan, an emperor
Now cobra Jamaican nigga flexin', yup
Brooklyn is the best in this, haters who need evidence
I'm sellin' it all separate and buildin' money like Tetris
Irrelevance, my detriment, body baggin' perfectionist
Expressionist and I'm goin' express, niggas get left
Guitar on my chest, spittin' that depth
You heard that I'm comin' for heads and cuttin' ya neck
Better speed up, you 'bout to get left
Sick with the rhymes, come with a crime
Murdered the track, I'm doin' some time
Livin' divine, sign of the times
Takeover, it's Cooper nigga

[Chorus]
State of Elevation, now I'm levatatin'
Raisin' stakes, it ain't too late
Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud, it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we mothafuckin' blazin'
Hey, we levatatin'
Raisin' stakes, it ain't too late
Weed got me feeling great
Floatin' on a cloud, it's amazin', Jimmy purple hazin'
Takin' over nations, we mothafuckin' blazin'
