[Intro]
That's C-O-O-P wow wow

[Verse 1]
Yo, serving these fools up like Federer
Temper like McEnroe, animal
Bitch I am Captain America
Valet don't ask for my papers, my paper be stacking across every nation up
Guess I'm paying bruh
I call you Andrew Jackson cause you worth a dub
I'm everything you wanna be but I love my impostors
You ain't know what it was like when up a young rasta
I was all alone on my lonesome
Junior high school y'all by myself nigga
When to high school at Irving glowed up
Got around some real niggas and they showed me where the work is
King Cooper, El Capitan muthafuckin' Dark Knight boi
Eyes low but I see everything in my sight boi
Peripheral vision get in my way, you [?] taking blood
Trust me though, I take the fight boi
Wolf, how long fucka sharks fish nigga, you just bitch made, you get lost in the surf boi
Cookie up, plate full with that seafood
I servin' all these fuckin' jaws, man they see-through
I be doin' mickey, tellin' niggas "be you" (be you)
They can never do what C-double-O-P do
Press CTRL-ALT delete on all these foo's
Ray Charles, hit the road Jack, I don't see you

[Hook]
'Cause I'm blind to the bullshit

[Verse 2]
Yeah, check
Yeah, move in silence keep it quiet
Lookin' for the kid but you can never find him
I don't fuck with niggas, nah they ain't my partners
Come around and peep the swagger line they pockets
Pocket pickin' peasant, flows [?] pigeons
Plottin' on your smilin' wanna fuckin' bitches
Hide behind the screenand trollin', twitter fingers
I ain't got the patience, shit I'm takin' victims, waves
I been so tolerant
Livin' in a world that feedin' off of greed and politics (niggas greedy)
I don't give a fuck about another man's acknowledgement (fuck these niggas)

[Verse 3]
Yo, I'm burnin' up, fire blazin', fuck these pagans, black and fire like a raven
Seven Nation Army, got the White Stripe on me, eagle eye I'm aimin'
Find my way out the maze, two eyes closed, my third eye amazin'
I don't even need to look to spot a fake nigga, feeling vibrations
Pack of 20's, seven shoguns, strollin' like a Kappa man I ain't jokin'
Tell 'em niggas better pay attention, got that addy if you need to focus
I don't fuck with niggas on my school niggas, ashy wit' it needin' lotion
Close my eyes, all I see is dollar signs while I'm tokin' up that potent
Makin' money makin' money, count it up
And my shorty, makin' money count it up
Stackin' paper 'cause I'm too intelligent
I'm 23 and nigga made investments man (gettin' rich)
Bend the game and Im'a be a manager, fuck I'm talking Im'a be a CEO
Made Ridiculous and Driven and [?], watch me build up my empire bruh

[Hook]
'Cause I'm blind to the bullshit
I don't see no lames
I rock hater blocker frames
Yeah, my shit's prescription
RIP to all the lames [x3]
