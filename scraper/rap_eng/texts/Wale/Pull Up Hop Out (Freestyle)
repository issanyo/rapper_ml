[Intro: Wale]
The name of the game is consistency
What up Wale I got you
Hold up, bitch I wahler she say pull up
In the end just skrt up
I bet they know they can't fuck with me
Mayback music
Turn that shit up

[Verse 1: Wale]
Double M my emblem, I can go wherever
And I can go with ten hoes and them ten hoes could't be cousins
I can go out Landover maybe Ardmore with my brothers
Synder got me for the family pass so I could snap that with Kirk Cousins
Ralph flow they can't fuck with
Ralph flow to confuse 'em
Soutside niggas outside, niggas lil G them boys dem use it
Killer weed I got it from the Bay
I'ma roll up me a KD
Iggy Dollars like he Draymond
Pretty Js like its Curry
Feel that there about the shot nigga
Capital we in the drop nigga
Ten summers every hood love it
Trent Williams on the block nigga (big Trent)
Twelve comin' with a fuckin' roll up
Where the loud put it down get a nigga shot up
Holla black lives forever matter
Baby momma got a Birken only for [?]
We keep it G we keep it so 100
DMV bitch I eat all homage from it
Pull up, hold up
Thinkin' about new Wraith get that [?] up
I should cosplay Luke Cage DMV I'm too great
They can't fuck with me

[Hook: WillThaRapper]
Pull up and hop out
Your bitch she on my dick, woah
I work out, and purp out
Her nigga mad as shit, so?
I told him pop out, and pull up
He say he wanna kill me, oh
Why he acting scary?
He got a 30, I knew he wouldn't blow

[Verse 2: WillThaRapper]
It's time to let these niggas know
Where I'm from, niggas killing over clothes
Them bitches trading up they goals for some dough
They'll set a nigga up, set they niggas up, anyone they know
For a come up, get they funds up, to get any kind of dough
I only fuck bad bitches, not just any kind of ho
Smoking strong all week, I don't chief any type of dope
These niggas' traps ain't on the map
They moving any type of dope
Selling crack stepped on like cracks
Junkies don't even wanna smoke
Meet with the plug, take all the drugs
Then I leave him on a boat
There ain't no 30 in this bubble
Just this nina in my coat
Always got that dick up in her, swear Selena jih ho
These bitches uppity as fuck
She ain't green, she gotta go
That triple beam, it balance low
My diesel jeans, New Balance flow
Put my kids all on her lips, if that lil bitch a childish ho
Disrespectful, I respect who? not nobody, not a soul
My money running like a nose, its like my pockets got a cold
A lot of dope, snottin' slow
I shoot 'til the chopper broke
She suck my dick, slob and stroke
But she say she not a ho
I don't argue, fight, or fuss
I catch my nut then adios
Had to cancel all her plans
I bust all on her party clothes

[Hook: WillThaRapper]
Pull up and hop out
Your bitch she on my dick, woah
I work out, and purp out
Her nigga mad as shit, so?
I told that nigga pop out, and pull up
He say he wanna kill me, oh
Why he acting scary?
He got a 30, I knew he wouldn't blow
