[Verse 1: Black Cobain]
Mines is family over everything
And getting money is the song I sing
Churches with dirty pastors my people pass the collection plate
He buy the Benz with acres of crazy real estate
That's motivation, my people living wicked
That's food for thought you muthafuckas can do the dishes
And I got nieces who need me they fathers ain't important
Instead of birth they should've contemplated abortion
I got a girlfriend she like them Gucci shoes
She hold a nigga down, you deserve them boo
Rolling in Porsches I see it I need that Panamera
I'm going gorilla on niggas I think I'm Che Guevara
I got Virginia, they with me, it ain't another realer
Don't fuck with chickens them bitches will give you salmonella
This BOA, what's your motivation
I summed it up in a verse my Kelly Rowland's waiting

[Hook: Tone P]
I said patience persistence got the world listening
My city's culture to the game now in existence
What's you motivation, huh, what's your motivation
Not concerned with most rappers me I'm a king
Bars crazy of course I'm living the dream
What's your motivation huh, What's your motivation

[Verse 2: Wale]
Motivated no debate I'm a-fuckin-mazing
So fuck the speculation
Bitch I'm as cold as basements
See this what happens when you rap like you ain't no ones favorite
Though you know you the greatest the totem pole is just way up
And you down, hold it down for my nigga them
Lost my nigga last week, tears still lingering
Though it's strange, growing pains have a way of teaching us
Though I'm chasing dreams I don't ever care for sleeping much
Lacerate the swisher gotta fill it with some killa
Got me feeling light-headed yeah nigga Philip Rivers
Weird niggas make sick too I don't need no pistol
Cause everybody know all of my niggas with me skipped school
Classless niggas ask me if they give a fuck
They blast for me and I don't roll with no atheist
I give my lady love, I need my lady's love
You be chickens like Smokey tripping off angel dust
Tony Lewis told me do it
Told me rep the city good keep the board moving
I'm a good winner, I'm a sore loser
And I be getting to the point just like a short hooper
Earl Boykins I 'm hearing voices I try and listen
Out in the district they selling water and buying pistols
I'm selling wisdom, just try and listen I'm tryna get you
I'm trynna make a couple million off my ambition

[Rick Ross Talking]

[Hook]

[Bridge: Tre of UCB]
I hear the people talking
I know these haters watching
I know the souls and spirits with me, walking with me

They can't break my concentration
I know the road I'm taking
I know the moves I'm making
I am my inspiration

[Hook]
