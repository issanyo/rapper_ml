[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
We got this king size to ourselves
Don't have to share with no one else
Don't keep your secrets to yourself
It's kama sutra show and tell

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Woah-oh-oh
There's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd love to be in trouble with you

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You've got to give it up to me
I'm screamin' mercy, mercy, please
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Verse 2: Wale]
Chocolate city, we back baby
I go verse to verse with the top MC's
When it come to girls, they ain't on my league
I'm like Mr. Marvin pulling up to that party singing
Mercy, Murcielago me
Man, baby you phat, mean that outta respect
Hello, wake up, girl
Kill a nigga with sex
We might turn it to real
All I need to get fly
The way I propel, bottle rocket or jet
A6, Greystone with 8 chicks
Guarantee if they act bad, then they rich
I'm like Marvin in his prime
Even though he not around, know the city still got him

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Woah-oh-oh
There's lovin' in your eyes that pulls me closer
It's so subtle, I'm in trouble
But I'd rather be in trouble with you

[Bridge: Charlie Puth]
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Ooh, baby, I got that healing that you want, yeah
Like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
You got the healing that I want
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on, babe
You've got to give it up to me
I'm screamin' mercy, mercy, please
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
Just like they say it in the song
Until the dawn
Let's Marvin Gaye and get it on
