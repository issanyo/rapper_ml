It's the perfect plan
So inspired, so devious yet so simple
This is what I do

[Verse 1 - Wale]
Listen, these niggas is tripping
These niggas been thinking we ain't tripping off lyrics
Soulja Boy Tell 'Em did better then the regular
But hold the beat, he ain't speaking for everyone
Nah, nah, these niggas is lunching
If we think of success as only measured by your money
Cuz money never lasts, in fact it's only last
On the list of impactful things one can ask for
So, with that, we need us a plan
Respect has grown inferior to fucking soundscan
If that don't sound bad you should ban me
I don't give damn about grands see my mind's on a grammy
Admire my mind, admire what I write
Cause hype gets you Rick Mirer'd every single time
But nah, he is quite different
Cause his hype and talent still manage to equivilate
They are not legitimate enough to belittle us
It's them who've lost love, and love for a lyricist
So I gotta pitch them this, for a better outcome
You say the art's dying, nah brother buy a album, The Plan

[Verse 2 - Wale]
These niggas is lazy
These niggas complain about Wayne, Kanye and Jay-Z
These niggas is bothered, these critics be talking
We sometimes acknowledge the beat as from
Â But rather than singing non praise the dude
Rasie the bar to a level unattainable
Niggas download that cause they scared to do
What the Soulja Boy fans be prepared to do
What the B5 fans get their mother to do
Them cowboy country singers going forever recoup
It ain't nothing too you, but shit it's something to me
I mean it's something to we, artists, it's something to eat
So if we come with the peace or we run with the piece
Giving niggas the piece of mind to put it to beats
Now the first week sales can't hardly compete
This is a market of beats, this is the end of the glow
That's why rappers is actors trying to dabble in clothes
I just rap cause I'm posed to, nigga this what I know
I conclude, buy my music no more free downloads
They can't steal my quotes, can't steal my show
Shit I bought them tracks, stupid bitch I'm broke
And you live with your folks, wifi-ing it up
Find a couple of blog sites to finish it up
Tuesdays used to matter now the only thing that happens is
You, you and you're saying "Shit, I been had that
Shit I been heard that niggas been working
Hurricane clapping, lyricism ain't working
I mean it's been working but we don't get support like orphans
So now this work's been worthless
Now if you give us a chance
They say hip-hop's dead, I believe it's just the fans
It's The Plan
