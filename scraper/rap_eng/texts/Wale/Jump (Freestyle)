[Intro: Wale]
Look, we gone have some fun tonight
My name is Dub-A-L-E
I love this shit knocking , I let this shit knock yeah, Shorty hear it knocking, She suck it through my boxers

[Verse 1: Wale]
Don't try to compare this to anything you ever heard
Thinking about who the fuck your nigga gone serve
Riding that big body, but y'all be hitting the curb
Blowing that money here, making money in Europe
Bonjour the broke, whole squad abroad
Now I get laid-off, notice y'all employed
Niggas fuck with your boy, I can make you some money
Niggas passing me blunts, bitches passing me pussy
They was calling me legend, Before they called me a rookie
They was calling the feds, now they call me for bookie
Y'all slumming, summer coming, I think its time to cook up
You hold her money down, Im her vagina hook up
Wild nigga, foul nigga how am I'm so efficient
I would Gasol you niggas, but I'm in no position
I undertaker kill it, I Hulk Hogan rip it
Super high, superfly Snuka Under A Nigga
Popping something thats forbidden and every single fifty
Droppin jackets on the stripper and every single is fifty
I'm addicted to pretty women addicted to winning
I get that facebook, your position is pending
Stop it, love it when a girl stay jocking, they hawking
They Josh Smith And Crawford
They calling me often to offer me walls
I hit you from rewind it'd be hard to move forward
Todd up at Warner, Joey up at Warner
Got a new deal bitch and this is just a warning performance
Real light jab to opponents
My rap isn't fast but I have been the coldest
Glad that you noticed, cash in the Moncler coat a nigga hold it
Nigga so focused, shout out that ? a quarter six forty
Evidence shades man they go for six forty
Gifted flow but not Christmas so, but that sick shit, pimp shit to get you to notice
Double M-G nigga please smell the Folgers, the beat should be covered by the fleas and the vulture
Over, killed it, branded I felt her, her man isn't needed like a tan on a Delta
Blue suede sheets no Elvis, smoke niggas by the nuggets, Go Felton, Go Felton
