[Intro: Wale]
I ain't so sure that being social
Is the sole cure to my soul's woes
But I take this here, take it to la la land
Pop up in the drop top Phantom
Let me see what the odds are
Playing in this, starstruck planet
Hollywood, Hollywood
Blue Moon

[Hook: Wale]
I just land at LAX
Kush man is on the text
God damn I missing home, yeah
But I'm off to get the cheque
Run it back, I just land at LAX
TMZ be on my back
Bentley's, double R, yeah
We don't need no Uber yet
I just land at LAX
Kush man is on the text
God damn I missing home, yeah
But I'm off to get the cheque
Run it back, I just land at LAX
TMZ be on my back
Bentley's, double R, yeah
We don't need no Uber yet

[Post-Hook: Raheem DeVaughn]
We so far gone, so far away from home
We so far gone, so far away from home
We so far gone, so far away from home

[Verse 1: Wale]
On a 1 on 1, yeah
Bad whips slow as fuck, yeah
Driver let me light one up
Cause a nigga flight was long as fuck, yeah
My nigga Y just showed up, yeah
Had a flight with a bunch of hoes, yeah
And you know that he brought the hoes, yeah
Ain't got heist on one
I just land at LAX
Virgin American, right
You niggas live with your parents and when you get this year
I might get in an appearance tonight, am I right?
I just land at LAX, yes
East coast is giving me stress, yes
'Bout to handle both sides, nigga
Like I'm ambidextrous, yeah
Run it back, I just land at LAX
And the white boy, why the cameras staring me up?
Might tell him two times he need to move
He just do a Kanye, and giving a boost
But I'm good, I just land at LAR
In and out like Monty style
In and out, I'm out of broads
All the while, my house playhouse are high

[Hook: Wale]
One more time I just land at LAX
Kush man is on the text
God damn I missing home, yeah
But I'm off to get the cheque
Run it back, I just land at LAX
TMZ be on my back

We don't need no Uber yet
That was good, I just land at LAX
Kush man is on the text
God damn I missing home, yeah
But I'm off to get the cheque
Run it back, I just land at LAX
TMZ be on my back
[?], double R, yeah
We don't need no Uber yet
