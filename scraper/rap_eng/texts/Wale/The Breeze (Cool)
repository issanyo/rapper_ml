[Seinfeld excerpt]
"Aw, I don't like this one bit."
[Coughing]
"... Can't stop now ... I'm addicted! They got a hold on me!!"

[Verse 1: Wale]
Cool, as a summer breeze, pimpin' is nothing to me
Roll up the purple and breathe, sit back and fuck up the beat
Them niggas be hatin' but, them niggas suckers to me
Who here is fucking with me? It's not a discussion, I be
In my own class, bitch I got them cold raps
I fuck the world and fuck your girl and give them both a orgasm
Leave your show cancelled, leave 'em with no answer
The master of my domain, yes I am no Costanza
First I have potential, now I got them answers
I'm smoking on that voodoo, and that's word to Papa Shango
Cooler than a fan circulating
When they dancing in my face, I get one chance then I'mma take it
So, lord forgive me for my indirect sinnin'
Am I cheating on this woman if I'm gettin' naked pictures from another
I love her, and I'm always gonna want it
But let me be 100, see monogamy's redundant
Sometimes you find the one, sometimes you give it up
Sometimes you buy the ring, with no problems you will love
Sometimes it ain't what's up, sometimes you play the fool
So for now I'm doing me, and I'm finding it's cool...

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I hear 'em talking and they all saying they doing they thing
But they not like me
I'm getting all this lovin'
All this money
That's how it is and how it's gon be
When you're ballin' (When you're ballin')
You can see who ain't your fans
Watch them niggas on the sideline hatin' (sideline hatin')
But I'm too high up, I can't hear what they sayin'

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Definition of cold: ice, 30 below
Champagne, foreign names in my pool
Take you home, let you sleep in my clothes
Roll some weed, the homies ain't gotta know
Get you high, keep it on the low
All this paper I fold
Meetin' fuckin' hoes on the road, it's takin its toll
Now how you think, don't even speak unless you talkin' franklins
Ran out of weed but see, I kept it G and brought a joint to bake so ..
(It's cool)
So cool, my bitch got no shoes
My whip is new but I'm playin' old school
Always keep it up to date, that's why the hoes choose
Yesterday's paper, that's why you old news
Hating on my team until they see we won't lose
Homey used to be a player, now I coach fools
On how to get your money, live it and spend it just how you're supposed to
Call some bitches to roll through and...

[Bridge: Wale]
What is hittin' for
My niggas is winning though
Everywhere I'm at
I make you feel like it is 10 below
It ain't nothing yo
Let me change the temperature
And do I need to mention when
What is hittin' for
My niggas is winning though
Everywhere I'm at
I make you feel like it is 10 below
It ain't nothing yo
Let me change the temperature
And do I need to mention when

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I hear 'em talking and they all saying they doing they thing
But they not like me
I'm getting all this lovin'
All this money
That's how it is and how it's gon be
When you're ballin' (When you're ballin')
You can see who ain't your fans
Watch them niggas on the sideline hatin' (sideline hatin')
But I'm too high up, I can't hear what they sayin'

[Verse 3: Wale]
Back in my zone
Fresh out the B.E.Tizzi
Shout out Bieber and Nicki
Tell Mr. Hill we ain't trippin, we cool
I'm blowin' sticky, I'm blowin' out of that lex
I'm living with no regrets while I'm getting over my exes
Access granted, take a step up to my world cuz
My niggas is thorough cut, sip until I hurl up
O cuh, hold up, I got bitches sewed up
What yall niggas know about it, My kick game is world cup
World cup I know that they dont get me
I keep them bitches clean, though my sneakers game is Messi
Due to my underselling no I did not get that Bentley
But this AMG will do for now and you niggas won't catch me
Vicious transmission for my vicious ambition
I just wanna rep my hood so I be good if I dont get rich
I'm good if yall dont listen, just catch me out the district
And I'm probably in some limited edition they ain't never shippin'
Sometimes you do get dough, sometimes you get the cheese
Sometimes you go stores and buy everything that you see
Sometimes you do get broke, sometimes you be on E
But for now just roll it up and just become one with the breeze

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
I hear 'em talking and they all saying they doing they thing
But they not like me
I'm getting all this lovin'
All this money
That's how it is and how it's gon be
When you're ballin' (When you're ballin')
You can see who ain't your fans
Watch them niggas on the sideline hatin' (sideline hatin')
But I'm too high up, I can't hear what they sayin'
