I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been

[Wale-Talking]
To whom it may concern
I refuse to be another being on this earth
I'm breathing for a purpose
I wanna be the center piece of my entire culture
And I've been thinking bout you
Cause you've done such
By doing such
I get a pen and paper
Write you a letter cause you are appreciated
I'm dreaming to be great
While working on my mistakes
You promise that's change
I'm doing the same thing

[Wale-Verse 1]
Dear Mr.Obama
I'm hoping that this letter reaches you
In good spirits
Lord knows you've been busy
But I just wanna know if I speak could you listen
We in the same city I was hoping I could visit ya
If not I'm hoping that this letter could convey how I'm feeling
And you could find interest
First off congratulations on the win
It's time for some change to commence
I gotta question for you man
From an African American stance
Are we expecting too much from your four year plan?
And what about the rappers
That happen to act like a black president
Give us a right to be assholes?
You know
They say your name for attention
But little to no interest after election
Or the too cheap t-shirt sellers
That's making revenue of a name we cherish
As I end this letter
One more thing, I hope you understand your impact on our race
Sincerely Wale
P.S Eh I ain't trying to nit pick
But keep them cigarettes away

[Hook]
I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been
You have this letter
Finally got excited
But there's nothing else inside

To whom it may concern
I refuse to be another being on this earth
See I'm breathing for a purpose
I need to be the center piece of my entire culture
And I've been thinking bout you
Cause you've done such
By doing such
I get a pen and paper
Write you a letter cause you are appreciated
Like damn mama the reason I work hard

Not even my favorite rapper
You was bigger than an artist

[Wale-Verse 2]
Dear Pac
I was twelve when the gunned you
Wish you was around now to see what I've become see
You never had a son, In the physical or literal
Years later there's still a bunch of little you's
Never seen you as lyrical
But more as a voice that the whole culture would listen to
Speakin the truth like only you can do
It's only right we lose greatness at its pinnacle
I got a question for ya, little somethin to say
Are you still mad at Biggie ? Are you still mad at Dre ?
And are you happy at the way your legacy portrayed ?
I'm trying to do for D.C what you did for L.A
But music today, it's getting lame for us
They chasing fame rather than making a change for us
They stop being artists, they stop being honest
They want that club shit, ain't no more dear mama's
And you don't know me
But knowin you through music is going to change the world
In the futuren, truly yours , Wale
P.S Hey, How long will they mourn you? Forever and a day

[Hook]

Finally got excited
But there's nothing else inside

So I'm writing you this letter
And I can only hope that you read it if you get it
Hoping if you get it that you won't ever forget it
You won't never forget it
You won't never forget it (x2)

I'm writing you to
Catch you up on places I've been
You have this letter
Finally got excited
But there's nothing else inside

I'm writing you to

You have this letter
Finally got excited
But there's nothing else inside it
