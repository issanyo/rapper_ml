[Wale]
Off rip, I'm a double M-G nigga
Running this shit bet you lil' niggas flea-flicker
Windows down, letting bitches snicker
Got cheap bitches, got cheap liquor
Dropping C-notes on strippers at the casino
I'm making movies: them Kill Bill's and Tarantino's
Lyrically Aristotle, lyrically can't see it
Them bammas can't see the bars, y'all some paralegals
I smoke sweets in the suite, like this shit is legal
Cover the building in green my nigga: Fred Segal
Ha, okay that 90210 talk
Bitches talk to me, and they send you niggas postcards
What you think I flow for? Y'all niggas is old dog
Y'all over the hill like you tryna race a soapbox
And even if I'm broke, dog
I'd rather have no job than no heart
Wale!

[Pill]
Flow retarded, I need to wipe the slob after every bar
Wreck beats daily, have 'em looking like Halle Berry car
Accidents happen when I got the Mac in hand
Mic defibrillator give haters heart attacks in advance
It's M-O-E, so all I need is more chips
Swag stand out like pimples and cold-sore lips
Ugh! Pill hotter than a snotty nose
Body doze, who not exposed, give em karate blows
Liu Kang the way I kick it, bumping Wu Tang
Try to protect the neck, I ? from ya boo thang
Parking lot of the blue flame, flows hotter than butane
If you lame, the only way you hang is like Hussein
See, there's a war going on and I'm the general
And I'mma speak it directly at ya: no subliminals
See, all my life I was raised by a lot of criminals
So all I know is scratching my pistols and my genitals

[Stalley]
Picture this: picking kicks out of Foot Locker
Thinking how I could rid evil and let the good conquer
I'm mixing mad emotions, you know the hood'll haunt ya
Driving you bonkers, eating roaches, yeah: just look at Yonkers
Most of them ain't conscious, they just monsters, tryna be some mobsters
They call me conscious, and I think I'm better
Cause I'll be honest
I ain't tryna be a victim of the projects or a uniformed man
I'm tryna uniform 10 million men
Unify them, mob through, take over and
Maybe I'm beyond myself, maybe these are my thoughts
Should I die by myself insubordinate?
I start a revolution by myself, niggas better call for help
Til there's no telling whose side are you on?
Pick one or move on, a war going on outside no one is safe from

[Meek Mill]
Self-made, 60K the first week
I signed with Maybach, and we did that ish the 1st week
Before this rapping, I was trappin', getting work cheap
Now it'll cost you 30 racks to get a verse cheap
Sheesh! I'm like R.I.P
I dropped 2Pac Back and did it B.I.G
America's most wanted like Chi Ali
I'm too young to be doing this, they need to see ID
Ross said I'm hot, Tip said I'm hot, Swizz said I'm hot
Your chick said I'm hot
I went and bought a whip for some chicks and a drop
Now my watch fruity colors like Trix in a box
The money ain't running, it's standing still now
I'm getting it, hustlin' like I'm still down
Suckas is talking like I ain't still around
They can't deal with me, I got a deal now
Big face hundreds, big face Rollies
I be throwing deuces, suckers they don't know me
MMG the team, and I think I'm Kobe
I'm ridin' on that thing with 20's like Ginobli
G-5 sitting on the runway
Just to go to LIV on a Sunday
I spend it make it right back on a Monday
All my niggas rolling, and we bout that gun play
Meek Milly
MMG

[Rick Ross]
If you don't know, Maybach is the clique
I'm screaming "Maybach!" til I'm rich
All the chicks see the money, clothes never bummy
Satin to the silks, I'm icy when it's sunny
Look around: we the largest in the game
All them other boys targets and I'm flawless with the aim
Hit your block with a Glock, blog that
North Philly, Meek Milly - where my dogs at
DC, Wale - nice ball cap
New golds Rolls Royce, yeah I'm all that
Couple milli in the bag and my face good
Buy a chick a new pad when she taste good
10 chains, hustle hard: Ace Hood
Smoke ? you know it taste good
Scoop pills, 5 G's on a phone bill
Sunlife Stadium, smoke on my home field
MMG man, we smoked out
