[Wale]
Black and Yellow bottles at my table, I’m ballin’
Black and yellow ladies at my section, I called ‘em
Balck and yellow whip, black and yellow SS
Black and yellow everything nigga, Mike Tomlin
Look at my carnage, bitches be astonished
Up all night with college hoes, edibles and bong hits
This just ain't no song shit, do this for my city Joe
But to get my city on, had to let me city go
Shout outs to my Philly hoes, told her drop that eagle low
Called that bitch my quaterback, wild cat all that
Give it to these broads,Imake em soar back and all that
You don’t sleep on nothing but a comforter and skull cap
Me I never call em back, she said that y’all go together
She just let me beat and you an acapella kind fella
Black and Yellow
Yeah ain't that what the song say
What you calla lifetime, I just call a long day

[Wiz Khalifa]
Ah ha, you know what it is…

[Wale]
It’s no days off, you ain't doing shit
Shout outs to them Taylors and them Jets fool
It feel like Woodstock in a nigga dressing room
Looking at my opposition like bust and move
From where they take them old beats and turn em into news
You can end this verse premature
But I got skeptics and some fans that just be needing more
Louis V don’t see the store, going in there and leave it gone
Flyer than the rest of ‘em, I hold the beat to reinforce
I dont be in wars, so I dont need a fort
I just be in the cut, my nigga Neosporin
Some niggas slept on me but I dont see the snoring
Some niggas sayin’ bullsh-t but they don’t be important
They don’t want, my attention, I’m cool cousin
A lil liquor a lil rose for my lil young’n
A nigga suffer, ain't eating nothing they still bluffin
While I go hard and spit retarded like them little busses
I’m still buzzin’, chick is something like nigga fuck it
Y’all little niggas like lil busses with lil budgets
You lil niggas is silly you think my niggas budging
I think you niggas funny, I leave you niggas bludgeoned
Hold up…ok
Black and yellow j-force
Always wear a rubber so they never ever late for it
Than we celebrate when they on it
She can nip it in the bud and leave that bitches face warm, yuughck!
In my best Pusha imitation
Bitch I’ve been ballin’ all alone, like the gym is vacant
And I’ma need some more Patron I don’t want no chaser
I’m throwing hundreds at KOD, a little paper
And you’re girl working out, I let my niggas train her
You Tim Tebow ass niggas probably still gater
I chump chump pussy if it smell good to me
And I don’t do nothing to her but she do it to me
I’m trifling, damn right ignorant
Mic magnificant, you’re all simpletons
Insecure as bitches blind dating with a pimple there
Baby I ain't liping, I just tend to keep my city there
On my back boy, holla back boy
Half a mill "Rap-Touring," Jarrett Jack boy

Black and yellow, black and yellow, black and yellow
(repeated)
