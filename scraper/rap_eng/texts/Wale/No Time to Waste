Don't talk about it, be about it, show me something
Don't talk about it, be about it, baby

The baddest chick strutting round the city
And every guy you call your friend, ain't just your friend

'Bout to give you everything tonight

And give you everything you want

[Verse 3: Wale]
Put the Audemar on
Tell your partner you're gone and let's rock, hey
Leaving my house to a broad
You prolly pick it apart and won't stop, hello
Look, got no time for no foolish pride
Got no time for your arguing
Congratulations, you played yourself
Like a lonely guy at over gym
Blue Moon all over here
Court sleeves, come over here
All I need like 3 pieces
And have RB chicks over here
IG me like all day
Bust she never follow
Using her friend's page
She think I'm stupid, I know
Valentino too much
And for to my all day
Tell me no, still too G
So everything is Gucci

[Hook: 4EY The Future]

Don't talk about it, be about it, baby
