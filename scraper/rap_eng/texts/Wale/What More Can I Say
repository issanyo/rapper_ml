[Intro]

[Verse 1: Wale]

Never been a nigga more intricate with the wisdom
Make my passion to critics ? backward opinions
It's crazy to think I'm crazy, it's passion my nigga
Living subscription on what having ambition will get ya
Fuck a video vixen, they got vicious intentions
Niggas run around with them chickens just leave with the fishes
Easily Leo Da Vinci when I piece in a picture
Leasin' a vehicle quick enough to see people that don't even exist yet
Marty McFly'ed in 'em, higher designer denim
Ya'll a bunch of dicks but I could still see the vagina in 'em
I ain't got time to swag nigga this is monumental
If you could read between the lines come and get your issue
I'm trynna tell you I'm sick of these niggas
Smoking more than Ricky Williams though Reggie is my nigga
No Reggie on my nigga, I moschino you niggas
And when it come to tight games I'm O.T. with the bitches
(yeah)
I'mma go hard so my momma kick her feet up
The abominable snowman would walk away anemic nigga
Honestly, no man is strong enough to see us
They ain't roll with all that fuck shit I can't stomach what they feed us
(heh)
Yeah I'm gon' leave with her
All up in her backspace like a delete button
Have a taste shawty, I think you need lovin'
You need direction, look what we encompass
Girls will love you for your cross they ain't jesus lovers
They just be eager for money they ain't trynna Jesus' mother
I leave and love 'em
I love and leave 'em
So many foams in my closet, no Walter Oliva
Pourin' this reefer, I'm rollin' like re-up
Model bitches is on line like "beliebers" on twitter
I need my respect, you can keep all the features
When I put this shit down, I put the DMV up

We up, We up, We up and We out
We out
