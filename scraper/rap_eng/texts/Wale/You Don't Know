[Intro: Tank]
If only you knew
If only you knew, yeah
If only you knew
If only you knew, yeah
If only you knew
If only you knew, yeah

[Hook: Tank]
If only you knew how much I do love you
Then you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout my niggas
Naw, see you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout these bitches
Naw, but you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
Baby, you don't know, you don't know, you just don't know

[Verse 1: Tank]
What's it gonna take for you to know you're the only one that I want around?
What's it gonna take for you to know you're the only one to hold me down?
Girl, you don't know that I know you should know
'Cause you don't know, you don't know, you don't know

[Hook: Tank]
If only you knew how much I do love you
Then you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout my niggas
Naw, see you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout these bitches
Naw, but you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
Baby, you don't know, you don't know, you just don't know

[Verse 2: Wale]
(Wale doe!)
Ay, blaze the 8 for that straight up
Is it love or lust? I can't say though
Why these snakes be on my mind?
But I left my Don C home today though
Honestly I can't take it
Baby I'm the sole reason you been winnin'
Lemme paint the story, I don't play with toys
She told me 'build me up' I told her 'leggo'
She wanna be with them popular hoes
I wanna be where my pockets will grow
She wanna be in an awkward position
'Cause I like a woman that think on her own
Don't need no cellmate, no cellular phone
That mean don't call me
Don't be all up on me
Don't grab me in public but ride me in private
That Patty was crazy but then got discovered
It's not

[Hook: Tank]
If only you knew how much I do love you
Then you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout my niggas
Naw, see you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout these bitches
Naw, but you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
Baby, you don't know, you don't know, you just don't know

[Bridge: Tank]
'Cause every little thing you do
I don't need a starting five now
Everything your body do
Do it to me every night
Girl, you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
Ain't no way, I'm gon' never let you go

[Hook: Tank]
If only you knew how much I do love you
Then you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout my niggas
Naw, see you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout these bitches
Naw, but you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
Baby, you don't know, you don't know, you just don't know
If only you knew how much I do love you
Then you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout my niggas
Naw, see you wouldn't be trippin' 'bout these bitches
Naw, but you don't know, you don't know, you don't know
Baby, you don't know, you don't know, you just don't know
