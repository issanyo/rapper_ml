[Intro: Rick Ross]
As I flip through pages of my notepad
Wow, I really wanna shine (M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music)
That’s what it boils down to, real shit

[Verse 1: Wale]
I just want my mind to be free
Never mind if they fond of me, I’ve been a beast
I recline in my seat, number nines on my feet
Womanizer admittingly, but mind you I’m deep
Although they inclined to critique
Motherfuck 'em, they couldn't lace up a nigga’s Chukka’s
Cause money talk and I make them bustas pay for discussion
Chasing duckets, chasing dreams, got me praying for foes
Chasing hoes, dick ‘em good enough to make ‘em propose
Winning, the feeling is so incredible
Something that’s forever true, my niggas over revenue
Little bit of Chanel, decorate your appearance
Double C’s on your purses, perfect I get the message
Isabel Marant, I get you some, you give me that
All of my thoughts fluorescent ink, though I’m always thinking black
Sitting back, cognac, sixty-two behind the pack
I ain’t thug, but I ain’t stupid four niggas, five slaps
Hold up, fire shots for the winners
And as long as I’m delivering, this genre’s gon' be winning
Double M-G pimping, my relevance never ending
My penmanship ain't too pretty, my ink is why they gon' feel me

[Hook: Wale]
This ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, Lord
This ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, Lord
This ink is why they feel me
Double M-G, thank you, this the real me

[Verse 2: Stalley]
I got a couple old schools and some new girls
They like old jewels and new pearls
They obey no rules, they some rude girls
You know the bad ones, that rule the world
They just wanna have fun, and crash parties
But when them games is over, they down to ride for me
Bonnie and Clyde story, Mick and Mallory
A killer in them sheets, they bring that ish up out of me
After that I sit and counting G’s after G, cause it’s right back to these ends
Send her on her way, tell her come back with some friends
We can do it all again
The repetition that I like, the reputation of a pimp
And I do it all on him, peep the way I limp
Pimp walk I been brought my chick, it was money well spent
They say it’s cold-blooded how I talk
I been winning this way for years, so what if I ain’t lost?

[Hook: Wale]
This ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, Lord
This ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me
This ink is why they feel me, Lord
This ink is why they feel me
Double M-G, thank you, this the real me

[Outro: Wale]
Sometimes it’s like, eyes is low, moment is perfect
You see things brighter than you normally see
With twenty-twenty, ya know?
Enjoy your vice
