Why do birds suddenly appear
Every time you are near?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
Why do stars fall down from the sky
Every time you walk by?
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
On the day that you were born
And the angels got together
And decided to create a dream come true
So they sprinkled moon dust
In your hair
And starlight in your eyes
Like they do
That is why all the guys in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
If only for a minute
I'd settle for an hour
And if you could stay just for one day
That would make me so happy happy baby
See it won't hurt to give our love a try
Girl don't u pass me by
'cause I'm that kind of guy
Who's going to love and treat you like a queen
That is why all the girls in town
Follow you all around
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
(i can feel it whenever
We touchin' whenever
We talkin' wherever we want)
Come a little closer baby
Lay your head up on my shoulder baby
Boy you know I can't deny it
You done already set my soul on fire
Just like me, they long to be
Close to you
