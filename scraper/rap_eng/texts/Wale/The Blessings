[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen I'm so fortunate that you could be back with me
And I'm so fortunate to be back with y'all
I'm bout to do it again
I'm bout to do it
I mean fuck these bitch ass niggas for real
Ralph Folarin young Olu

[Bridge]
I holla at my OG ask me what I'm gon do
Got me on my grown man standing on my own two
Yeah the streets is talking and they asking what you gon do
Folarin yeah its on you Folarin yeah its on you

[Verse 1: Wale]
God bless that man with ambition
For that man had a vision
No forty acres and no mule
But I know my mula extensive
And no I don't for treasure friendships
Solo dolo gotta respect it
Check this use be check to check now
Not quite check up on my check list
My gosh my grail, I pray hard work someday prevail
See lifes a beach when you on that water and play with shells
And I'm sand out what yo staring for
I know dirt balls might quick draw you for a pair of foams
Misunderstood nigga know to know me know to love me
And I know this fame shit is scary so I'm rarely sober in public
Usually I'm black hooded and im on the strap but they know my man isn't
Currenfly 3 k in these pants to get your clans men it
We all racist in moderation
David Stern bought the slave ship Paterson ran for acres fuck it we made it
And I cannot save em and know ma be saing go find you a lady
Then I ponder briefly then I spend 10 k on random strip club
Shake up break back see Wale back
And they keep talking that beef shit but these niggas keep talking that shake shack
Y'all small fry to me by these Oregon 3 and get these ko j.ps
Better drop that origami
God bless that man with ambition
For that man had a mission
But I still envy your normalcy
Its annoying them cameras will flicker
Somehow hatters done tripled
Im sure they hated a nigga before
I said that well I say lets make it official
Say my name ho say my name ho
Say my muhfuckin name ho
Cuz im reason all these pretty creatures tamed for
Times even though 5 even if I tried negro
My white teacher thought I would fry moving Dwight freethrow
Bricks I done some how climbed up out of it
No lucative I admit
But the booth was just my addiction
They knew me as Michael Vick
On the sack everytime I pitch
100 racks for the night might fit
This Hermes shit is light shit
I like to like a chick and I never love no ho
And the hottest bitches I be flipping yes I summersault
This summer fall this winters mine you niggas is dinner time
I'm thinking more, Tinker Hat you thinking more like finishline
That's right for life I keep my bitch fly
New foam alert, these blue checks and you niggas ainâ€™t never getting verified
Hating on Ralph man I revise
Revolution not televised
I be on my cool shit what they gon do with
When the jails and the schools roads in style

[Outro]
Right so whats up my nigga
I heard that you was looking for me
Sup my nigga ey you know I keep a little something with me
I don't know yall niggas but money make you enemies
So its fuck y'all niggas when you see a nigga don't even speak
God bless that man with ambition
