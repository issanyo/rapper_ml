[Intro]
Sometimes two people jump their feelings out
And get caught, in the moment
Before you know it
Making decisions that two people can't even agree with later on
This some food for thought

[Verse 1]
Yeah, as I walk up to the alter
I'm haunted by the thoughts of being husband, or a father
Prisoner of the moment, for the moment I was caught up
But I never ever thought that you would take me on this offer
Now I'm staring
At this love thing toe to toe
Wanted to jump the gun but ain't know it was loaded though
So, suicide I perceive, before I slide on that ring
I think of Nas and Kelis
Backing out guarantee she'll hate me
But I'm more scared of weddings than a funeral lately
See, It's something about commitment though
Cruising on relationship, but need a different boat
Different boat, different strokes, rest in peace Gary Cole
If I take an oath that mean I give up all my area code hoes
I really love my Miami crew
I just wanna keep it real
I don't wanna damage you
And for this moment no I won't ditch you
But if we add a year or two you my feelings may differ
Yessir, Mrs. anywhere that we can go
But marriage is a lifetime, honeymoon's a week or so
Maybe we just need to slow
Down just so we can grow
If this is the right time
Then later we can elope
Use patience as my best approach
But when she said this who am I now to say no

[Hook]
I was wondering maybe
Could I make you my baby
If we do the unthinkable would it make us look crazy
If you ask me I'm ready (2x)
