[Intro]
I try to tell them I'm one of the
Best thinkers of this class I'm in
I feel like

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'ma let the chips fall
Niggas is Kemba Walker tryna see me pitfall
Niggas Shyne like a synagogue: think about it
Centerfold bitches prolly couldn't get a drink up out me
They say I need some guidance
But I think they need a stylist
Bitch you should see my wallet
This bitch gonna need Pilates
And you can't see Folarin
What the fuck are you, retarded?
I ain't hugging the corner, but I hustle so enormous
A modern day Goodfella, I'm Ray Liotta
Loud smoking so pass the L like a semicolon
The Bentley is rented but I got many chauffers
Foamposites if you ain't got em then you penny-loafing!
Underrated that's temporarily for the moment
Only marry your woman if mama cold as Willona
See, I'm second to no one
I'm the messenger-poet
They slowly showin' they colors
They music good but they bogus
Wale

[Chorus]
They talkin'
Talkin' bout Folarin

[Verse 2]
Verse 2 gon be fucking with verse 1
Especially when you're writing shit that can never be done, Joe!
That Kevin Love flow
Bored of the shooters
My women be in the newest
Yo bitches should buy a loofah
Where I'm from they is ruthless
Babies turn into shooters
Crazy talking and foolish
You catch a shell like a Koopa
And I don't give a fuck, see my bitches is kama sutra
One of them bitches is cute, the rest of them congruent
Why you talking my nigga? Just go and do it
Niggas awful at dressing, they just a'ight at music
I'm trend-setting, despite of an awful debut
Still got me another deal big as any nigga in music
The remedy is get your hustle on
Fuck a broad unless you love a broad
Well in that case, brother, then love her hard
Put my trust in my dog
Put my trust in my God
'Less you Stabler and Benson, I don't fuck with the law

[Chorus]
They talkin'
Talkin' bout Folarin
