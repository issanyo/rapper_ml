[Hook]
We gonn hustle till the sun up, Lord knows
I’m grinding all day and this is all I know
I’m about that life, I’m about that
You ain’t bout that, look
Under pressure know a nigga won’t fold
I’m grinding all day and this is all I know
I’m about that life, I’m about that
I’m about that, I’m about that life

[Verse 1]
See I’m better than I ever been, so let’s be clear
I see these square niggas ain’t killin' shit
They tell it different, but I see no joy in a drug game
Where most niggas get slain
Or most niggas get snitched on
By the same niggas they came with
At the same time I think of Trayvon
I done take 2 hits and pass it, blow it all then pray hard
Where there is no middle classes, either rich or you poor
We never had no upper hand, that’s why us niggas we on
Look, you ain’t holding down your kids then you ain’t shit nigga
Pardon me, you's a bitch nigga
Then she stealing all the dollars from your seed
By all means call her what you please, talk to me

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Just a product of the District, sliding in that 60
2 but I ain’t threw up on that ramp of my position
Try and keep my focus, just try and see my vision
Lucas move a (?) keep them tunas out that kitchen
Look, see pastor on a Sunday
See bad word to Gunplay
See Ralph from the District
Where niggas seen crack since a youngin
And I ain’t no dealer, I’m a fucking gorilla
Keep my liquor cold please I’m rolling up the ogilla
Quarter brick, half a brick
You can sell it all, can’t catch me on that rapper shit
Every track I get, they get my habitat
You smoking weed before you rap bitch
I take laxatives, I’m shitting on'em

[Hook]
