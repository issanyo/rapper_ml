[Produced by Hit-Boy]

[Intro: Wale]
I concur, brother (?)
I see you've done quite well on this production
No doubt about it

[Hook: Wale]
Now do I got it? No doubt about it
Credit card without a limit so I bought it, bought it
Ain't tryna bother nobody but to be honest
When I'm on it I can body somebody, which body that want it
Do I got it? No doubt about it
Credit card without a limit so I bought it, bought it
Ain't tryna bother nobody but I be honest
When I'm on it I can body somebody, with yadda-yaddas
Talk to 'em

[Verse: Hit-Boy]
From the turf to the pavement, my engagement
To this life of uncertainty got me impatient
Instead of sayin' fuck it, OG's said pace it
My favorite past time took me places
Now I'm the best hitter on the diamond with loaded bases
And still can't get past this fake shit
I'd rather hang out with a racist
At least I know they hatin' you boy in ears whisperin' to men on some gay shit
But when I see 'em in public, they don't say shit
Niggas on you who keep thinkin' that girly shit is cute
Every word I utter a statement
Since cyphers at my momma's house like big ticker basement
Don't miss no payments
Yadda-Yadda, chitter-chatter, nigga's talk don't really matter
Spa dates with they baby momma, bust a nut on camera
I fathered whole styles, they like hold up Hit, slow down
Cause if this shit reach the masses our new shit gonna sound old now
Well nigga guess what, sayin' next to who next up
Gave my idols they best shit and still can't get checks cut
Now do I gotta think about it?
Come see about it
Fight parties at the house of Hit look like Caesar's palace
Have you ever hit your woman crush at 3:30 in the morning
Call her Uber like "bitch hurry"
I'm startin' to get worried, I'm faded, my vision blurry
Players in the game want me to lose like Steph Curry

Credit card without a limit so I bought it, bought it
Ain't tryna bother nobody but I be honest
