[Verse 1: Wale]
Standing on the couches, her man is out of towning
Have some adultery, baby, don't you go be so childish
Not into diamonds I'm shining just to get geechied out
When it get too cute I say "cool," I just let Miss Reesy know
Magic City, a stack for the fattest asses
My Black Bentley is rented, right now I'm stackin
This is my passion, I'm out Atlanta, smashing some action
And it's not just talk, when I get to the box I'm as dashing like Cassius
For the nights I was suffering, bought a condo in Buckhead
Like a condom that's scuffed up, I'm the wrong one to fuck with
Love it, they need it, the illest young'un to speak it
It's really something about me that make hot emcees go anemic

[Verse 2: Tity Boi]
2 chains, I got 2 bitches
Watch me put it all together just like 2 Swishers
Got your baby mama sending nude pictures
If you don't like it, hope you got your tool wit' ya
I'm an eskimo, nigga, I got cold bars
And my bank account look just like a phone card
Had to move that bitch so far she need a postcard
Then I switched the grill on the Chevy, got a nose job
Wet lips on the rims: I call em "blow job"
If they ain't getting money tell em "go rob"
Yea I'm ballin' hard like a globetrotter
Now I got em on they toes cause my flow hotter

[Hook: Tity Boi x2]
I'm balling bitch: globetrotter
If that pussy good, I tell that bitch "Let's go shopping"
These shoes right here ain't come from Foot Locker
I give a girl what she want - but no dollars

[Verse 3: Tity Boi]
I'm ballin bitch, you stallin bitch
3 cell phones and still I won't call a bitch
I like mine with no pork in it, want a meal with no fork in it
Outfit, I ordered it and I'm the shit? Where your toilet at?
I hope you recorded that, Too short, I'm born to mack
Too dope, two cups, this codeine not cognac
Come close, catch a contact, I got a loud pack in my cargo pocket
Got your girl in my condo poppin and ain't no way you're gonna stop it
Hard top, I'm gonna drop it, when I drop the top, she drops her ass
I drop the cash, pop bands then pop tags
In a muscle car and I'm smoking on a muscle bag
And I come through your window just like I'm Bruh Man

[Verse 4: Wale]
Paper chasin', paper chasin', MMG I'm paper chasin
Take you where you can't see black by K-Ci forever my lady
DMV, we on bitch
Recently they been on me
People speak and I be appalled like I'm 3 a guard from New Orleans
Hold up, couple rollers
Got a Nouveau and some Moet
And I bet that you gon love me
I respect that you don't know yet
That Moschino shit is so back
When I'm seen in that, they gon snatch
We don't care if niggas locked out
We gonna ball all year, nigga know that
Yea one for where my Lil nigga Mo at
Southwest where a little nigga zone at
MLK where my nigga G at
Now Iâ€™m liable to be where da weed at
Like they not gon' stare
Day and night are my 'posites rare
Bunch of whores, lightning 4's
See my Jordans spark, you ain't got no Airs

[Hook]
