[Wale:]
I needed to feel like you know... when your mother used to take you to the African parties

[Hook]
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover (this is for so the girls in nigeria)
My honey let me hold you (you know what it is, let me love you, forever)

[[Verse 1:]
Well, maybe not forever
She in withdrawal when we not together
Best foot forward, holla at your boy
And I can get em all without lots of effort
Take her home, and we can get it on
Make my jollof with lots of pepper
God has blessed her, prada dresser
Mix my guiness with a Dr. Pepper
Im so Naija, she so Igbo
She so sweet, shortie feed my ego
Me bold dude, Bola dipo olu
Whole crew, roll through, got more green than whole foods
African queen got what you need
Said my name wale, Ba wo ni

[Hook:]
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover, so honey let me hold you, let me love you, forever

[Verse 2:]
Who said I don't rep, I am naija all day
When I meet your mom I still du ba le
I am Wale, Olubo
We be in the party like we own that bar
No regard when I'm going at abroad
And I go up in a party like im going abroad
Understand that's fly, damn super fly guy land in Du Bai
Yall can't get it, I make yall get it
Hate estate and my iPod wit it
Money on the floor, throw it on a broad
This is not balling, but this is our culture
You is not hip then I can not coach her
If its not couture, I will not go to her
If its not k'naan, I will not co-tour
To much cognac wheres my chauffeur

[Hook:]
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover, so honey let me hold you, let me love you, forever

Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it
Said theres Money on the floor, spray it spray it

[Verse 3]
Ha
Here nigga on the road
When they here today what you say to them
Audible
I got buku broad
You are not hard you are fufu soft
We don't do more sales or croupon
We buy out stores till its all too gone
Don't go to far
Alot of niggas fake who go to hard
But there is money on the floor spray it spray it
Everybody wasted faded, faded
Henny in my cup don't need no chase
Don't know her name so I am just going to change it

[Hook:]
You're my sweetie, My sugar, My lady, my lover, so honey let me hold you, let me love you, forever
