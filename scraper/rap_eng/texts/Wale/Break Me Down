[Hook: Guordan]
Riding around in these streets girl
Same song on repeat girl
Life out here keep stressing me
Hating ass niggas keep testing me
Lost one of my soldiers
Roll an L and smoke it
Baby I want to be close to you when no one is around
Cause girl you break a nigga down
Girl you break, girl you break a nigga down
Girl you break, girl you break a nigga down
Girl you break, girl you break a nigga down
Whoa

[Verse 1: Omelly]
Baby girl you too real, for me to say that I made you
I remember I was on my last leg, and the way you held me down that was major
So I had to write this song for you
She want my love so I had to put it all in her
She like bae you've been doing shows all summer
I told her, "Well I'mma hug you all winter"
She wanted to fuck me on the first date
But she didn't cause she said it wouldn't feel right
Now its first class flights we scraping
And we can go where ever you like
I've never been a sucker for love, I'm a sucker for you
And in my eyes overall you a 20-piece from the shit that you do
She got a crib and a kid and your own job
Thinking the way you hold me down and that's no lie
And when you pull me out them streets
And we get freaky in them sheets
It's only right that a nigga hit from both sides

[Bridge: Guordan]
When shit go wrong you make it feel so right
I ride for you and I put it on my life

[Hook: Guordan]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Girl you break me down, girl you break me down
Girl that thing be wet as shit, girl don't make me drown
I bought a zip from out of North Philly I about to start the wake and bake now
Take a break from that 9 to 5 [?]
Girl I'm breaking yo down, let me break the smoke down
You say what's up with the beef between you and Meek I said, "Please just go down"
Breaking you down, ain't felt this good in a while
We finna ball within our out bounds
DC are the click we in town
Wassup to Omell, my nigga my round
The shit that we with the shit that go down
Bet you they watch their lips when we out
I just trying to watch her lips when we out
Then I'm breaking you down, probably have me saying my vows
I ain't out to save nobody baby I'm just saving the cases in style
Breaking you down

[Verse 3: Guordan]
It's hard to admit I need you more than you need me
When I'm around you take me out of my misery
I can't believe it, you do want to be in my family
I call you, you pick up, three in the morning, saying what's up
Come on over I got your body right beside me
Girl I love it when you ride me
Tell them I'm yours she don't got to hide me, no no
I fight with you we make love 'til you get in line
I don't let go I keep it in 'til you say its mine
And nobody knows half the pain I put you through

[Hook: Guordan]
