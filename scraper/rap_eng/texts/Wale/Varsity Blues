[News Report Snippets]

[Verse 1]
Ah, you say that you love me, know that couldn’t be real
My high school girlfriend dykin', my side bitch ain't take her pill
And all these bitches that I hung with ain’t doing too well
And every nigga that I hung with just use me for bail
Once considered a rogue, I was chilling alone
But I did have miss medusa, she loud and she leave me stoned
Used to ride little buses, I ain’t fuck with my teachers
They ain’t fuck with me neither, 15 and high on reefer
Thank God for what I did with blocking against this shaky defense
They don't think you a nigga as long as you fill up they bleachers
Yeah they always defend you, look how they say your name
But if you rupture a tendon I bet them feelings change
Look, just remember how that winning taste
Just in case a nigga never see that thrill again
Love the game though this is coming from a different place
Different stage, switching paces like I'm shifting strings
Look, just remember how that winning taste
Just in case a nigga never see that thrill again
Love the game know this is coming from a different place
All the cortisone in the world couldn't conceal the pain

[Hook]
Varsity Blues y’all, Varsity Blues
Varsity Blues y’all, Varsity Blues
Varsity Blues y’all, Varsity Blues
Varsity Blues y’all, Varsity Blues

[Verse 2]
Look, I’m talking Reggie Bush, matter of fact ask Cameron Newton
Matter of fact go ask they schools how many jerseys they was moving
Thank you for they tuition, thank you for room and board
Most of them niggas got no pot to piss doing four
Niggas thinking of moving, AJ flipping computers
Brandon Davies had relations, what if Jimmer was screwing?
They hate on Calipari, but I never seen the problem
They get one season poppin', at least he's being honest
They always in their class, they always at their practice
While they bumming for cash, you made a grip off a bracket
Shout out to mid-majors, who forget what they major
Just trying to go somewhere and play with Europe players
Pardon me, European, fuck who your current team is
Cause every QB with my features is a Willie Beamen
We never gonna be shit, 'less we believe we the shit
Penalty your leadership critiquing me some from the bleachers

[Hook]

[Outro]
Look, just remember how that winning taste
Just in case a nigga never see that thrill again
Love the game know this is coming from a different place
