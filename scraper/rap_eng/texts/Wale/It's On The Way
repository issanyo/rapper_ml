[Hook: Jacquees]
Hey
I know it's late
Round bout 2:33 you'll be on your way
Straight to my place
Put your phone down as soon as you're through the gates
We not taking phone calls
I don't need your friends involved
Don't be tense the Lord gon' cover our sins
We feeling great
They can't relate
We pouring shots, I smoke one to the face

[Verse 1: Jacquees]
One time for the girl doing her thing
And two times for the girl she tryna bring
Now it's three of us but two can't stay
But we got time who's down for some foreplay
Girl I'm grown, I'm tryna do it
Might do you wrong
You'll come back to it
You paint the pictures to my songs
I'm a sing inbetween your legs, all night long

[Hook: Jacquees]
I know it's late

We feeling great

We pouring shots, I smoke one to the face

Can you turn your phone off?
I need your undivided before
I slide between your thigh and go way more low than deep sea divers get (Deeper than divers get)
