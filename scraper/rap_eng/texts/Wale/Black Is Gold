[Intro]
It's shine season, yeah
Black, the black

[Hook]
The black is beautiful, baby, black is bold
Black is black, true, but black is gold, ay, hey, yeah, look
I say black is beautiful, shawty, black is bold
Black is black, true, but black is gold
Ay, let's do it

[Verse 1]
Look, black is beautiful, shawty, that you should know
Don't let American standards damage your African soul
Natural hair, oh with a weave under
I buy you Givenchy rags in rapid need for ya
I'll rap a feature and buy you pieces from people that you love
Celine Dion pay for that CÃ©line that you got on
Yeah, is you single? Is you good?
Can I get into ya (India) with Game 'cause your finger lickin' good
Ooh, you so sweet when you put on
I don't mind your body shy 'cause you can sleep in my cologne
Woo, yeah, okay, Wale on that other shit
That grown man, build up your mind, slide in your stomach shit
Hold hands rarely in public, they never notice us
They might as well tell you we on, we got the golden touch
Get it? Fuck with it
They might as well tell you we on, we got the golden touch, right

[Hook]
Black is beautiful, baby, black is bold
Black is black, true, but black is gold, ay, hey, yeah, look
I say black is beautiful, shawty, black is bold
Black is black, true, but black is gold

[Verse 2]
Uh, look, hey Miss Lupita
Hope you know you inspired the future women for us
Don't know your vibe really, just know that your mother Kenyan
Just know that that melanin mesmerizin' in every picture
God true, hey miss ducky, hey
I think your hair is amazin' but brain is even greater
Don't ever let what people say ever convince you ain't bae
Knowing hella actors black facin' trynna play us
God true, hey Viola darlin'
I see you shinin' with Shonda, thought I should rhyme about you
'Cause you body the monologues and you care 'bout us
Get away with murder every time you red carpet
God true, hey miss Issa Rae
Beautiful Senegalese, leader with shit to say
We should meet today, maybe out at Best Buy
#LawerenceHive, still I'm proud, Issa's a savage
Actually "Issa Knife", right

[Hook]
Black is beautiful, baby, black is bold
Black is black, true, but black is gold, no, ay, hey, yeah, look
I say black is beautiful, shawty, black is bold
Black is black, true, but black is gold, shine, yeah

[Outro]
I got tired of that
This for every beautiful queen listenin'
That may sometimes think we forget you dude to this bullshit system
This for every India Arie, young Justine Skye
And please don't go cut out on us now young SZA
Let's celebrate the awsomeness that is our sisters
My affinity is infinity and I wish you everythin' that gives you better energy
So be prouder, be flier
And like my auntie Michelle told me, we gotta do our job to reach high, holla, Folarin
