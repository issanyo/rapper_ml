[Verse 1]
From the 'burbs to the sticks, my words finna flip
I am here to take nothing and formulate a hit
I'm concoct awesome, flawless pause
I ain't letting niggas catch up, nigga I'm playing possum
Now pause if the off switch was gone there
Them haters don't like me it's gon' be a long year
I'm sitting on green feel I need a lawn chair
Niggas got a few g's I'll exceed Lauren Hill now
Miseducated by record labels I elevated to a higher level
So I am better than any hater

[Chorus]
And you know how I get
Embody my hip-hop shit
Personify greats or these label niggas is on my dick
Oh how they lean, I'ma go where I please
Pimp stroll where I please
Niggas know who I plead nigga
What you know about that, what you know about that, what you know about that
Probably know me from the rap
Roll on my feet when I'm rolling through the streets
Even on all day those doubles don't clean nigga
What you know about that, what you know about that, what you know about that
Probably know me from the rap

[Verse 2]
I am the leader of a revolution, the betterment of music
Is embedded in they head and chest and the entire unit
It's by pupils to require truth, and God do it
Cause fiction ain't legit so we deny tuning it
Yeah, I spit with pride when I'm doing it
Doing for the city though, I'm tired of this music shit
And you know how it be, they hating on a G
Don't pay for radios spins, my city loving me
Niggas logging on cause the young boss talk of me
And y'all songs so awful, please see

[Chorus]
And you know how I get
Embody my hip-hop shit
Personify greats or these label niggas is on my dick
Oh how they lean, I'ma go where I please
Pimp stroll where I please
Niggas know who I plead nigga
What you know about that, what you know about that, what you know about that
Probably know me from the rap
Roll on my feet when I'm rolling through the streets
Even on all day those doubles don't clean nigga
What you know about that, what you know about that, what you know about that
Probably know me from the rap

[Verse 3]
Do it for the city and prove it for the county
If forms happen to the rap game nigga no mouth piece
I'm Urlacher, the backpack of a verse thrasher
Break from the huddle, the coach stretching his first backup
I'm a monster, blitz when I want to
Bomb like lip gloss, bitch I am awesome
The storm you've been warned of it on and upon us
Flow so potent it penetrates the armor
Deification of all, a definition of raw
A star who gon' make it my reputation is marvelous

[Chorus]
And you know how I get
Embody my hip-hop shit
Personify greats or these label niggas is on my dick
Oh how they lean, I'ma go where I please
Pimp stroll where I please
Niggas know who I plead nigga
What you know about that, what you know about that, what you know about that
Probably know me from the rap
Roll on my feet when I'm rolling through the streets
Even on all day those doubles don't clean nigga
What you know about that, what you know about that, what you know about that
Probably know me from the rap
