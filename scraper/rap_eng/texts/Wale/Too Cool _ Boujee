Part 1: Too Cool

[Intro]
It's Eazy

[Chorus]
I'm just too cool (Said I'm too cool)
I'm just too cool (Said I'm too cool)
I stay lit like my birthday is the 4th of July (I do)
I wake up like this, I don't really even have to try
I'm just too cool (Cool)
I'm just too cool (Cool)
I'm just too cool, yeah

[Verse]
Coolest nigga on the block
Corduroy slippers with the black socks in 'em
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm feeling like 2Pac
Got some knowledge but I'm on the block
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I like cool ranch Doritos
And ice cream in the wintertime
Both sides of my pillow
North Pole in the summertime

[Chorus]
I'm just too cool (Said I'm too cool)
I'm just too cool (Said I'm too cool)
I stay lit like my birthday is the 4th of July (I do)
I wake up like this, I don't really even have to try
I'm just too cool (Too cool)
I'm just too cool (Too cool)
I'm just too cool, yeah

[Outro]
It's gon' be your favorite song

Part 2: Boujee

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Walk tall with your chest out
Paint your lips with the ruby
Tell Puff you ain't walking for the cheesecake
It's okay to be boujee
6 inch heels when you step out
If they a knife, you an Uzi
Tell Khaled you the best now
It's okay to be boujee

[Verse: Wale]
I sent a text message to your fine ass
You left a wet spot to remind that, mm
Slow whine and rewind that
Not forever on your mind, let me find out, mm shit
Evacuate the scene by the last scream
'Cause she know it wash day and these her last jeans
Turn a pool to a lake if it gotta be
And I keep her wheels turnin' 'til she tired of me, uh, die with me

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Walk tall with your chest out
Paint your lips with the ruby
Tell Puff you ain't walking for the cheesecake
It's okay to be boujee
6 inch heels when you step out
If they a knife, you an Uzi
Tell Khaled you the best now
It's okay to be boujee
It don't matter, it don't matter
It's okay to be boujee
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind if you boujee
