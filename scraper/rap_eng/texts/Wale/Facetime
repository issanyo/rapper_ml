[Intro: ?? & Eric Bellinger]
Baby (Yeah)
When you get home, I need you to do that one thing for me
Give me that splash if you know what I mean?
Facetime me in the shower, yeah
Facetime me in the shower, yeah
It's gon' be your favourite song
It's "E"

[Verse 1: AD & Eric Bellinger]
You don't do it for the fame, no
Knew you was different, you ain't nothin' like them lame hoes
That thing is water resistant, that's what it's made for
Iphone 7, I'm in heaven, what you playin' for?
Know all your friends all tell you that I'm bad news, bad news
Don't know what to do when I see them lower tattoos
Lot of niggas want it and I'm the only one to catch you
When I'm in your city, you best believe I'ma smash thru

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
Stay calling (True dat, true dat)
Stay calling (Yeah yeah)
Stay calling (Yeah, you do that, do that)
Stay calling

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Even when you can't come through
It's crazy how you still come through
I'ma a text you when I get up to the room
Hace that water running, you know what to do

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Just facetime me in the shower (Yeah yeah)
Just facetime me in the shower (Yeah yeah)
Just facetime me in the shower
(Can we do it, can we do it, yeah yeah, can we do it, can we do it)
Just facetime me in the shower
(Can we do it, can we do it, yeah yeah, can we do it)
Just facetime me in the shower

[Verse 2: Eric Bellinger]
You the one I hit when I hit the hotel
I know we can get it off and you won't tell
You don't want me to take no L's
'Cause you know I know that thing so well
I got money but the pussy is the power
If I could taste it, I will make it scream louder
So anytime you gotta half an hour
We-we can do it in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
(Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet)
Lemme see you

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Even when you can't come through
It's crazy how you still come through
I'ma a text you when I get up to the room
Hace that water running, you know what to do

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Just facetime me in the shower (Yeah yeah)
Just facetime me in the shower (Yeah yeah)
Just facetime me in the shower
(Can we do it, can we do it, yeah yeah, can we do it, can we do it)
Just facetime me in the shower
(Can we do it, can we do it, yeah yeah, can we do it)
Just facetime me in the shower

[Verse 3: Wale]
Now I got bands tonight
Girl, you know I ain't trippin', I brought bands tonight
Yeah, when I see it when it's dripping
I ain't gon' flex, she prolly the best
Haters out the way, Prada on her chest
Somebody wanna argue with her, Wale is the best
She my number 1 fan and my oxy connect
I party at Roxy, snobby women with
Courtside see Jamal, I'ma Paul a nigga (Get it?)
I got shooters that will probably clip ya
I give a woman a new future like you Scottie Pippen
(Really, one time, yeah)

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Just facetime me in the shower (Yeah yeah)
Just facetime me in the shower (Yeah yeah)
Just facetime me in the shower
(Can we do it, can we do it, yeah yeah, can we do it, can we do it)
Just facetime me in the shower
(Can we do it, can we do it, yeah yeah, can we do it)
Just facetime me in the shower

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
It's "E"!
Both of our bodies dripping wet
(Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet)
Facetime me in the shower, yeah, yean
Facetime me in the shower
Both of our bodies dripping wet
(Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet)
Facetime me in the shower, yeah, yeah
