[Chorus]
Come and talk to me, I'm serious, yeah
Come and talk to me, I'm curious, yeah
Money I can bring but I'm serious, yeah
Shawty, I can bring you somethin' different, look
Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it
Good dick and advice, I got you
If you need it in your life, I got that
I might put it in your life, you won't go back, go back
Come and talk to me, I'm serious, yeah
Come and talk to me, I'm curious, yeah
Money I can bring but I'm serious, yeah
Shawty, I can bring you somethin' different, look
Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it
Good dick and advice, I got you
If you need it in your life, I got that
I might put it in your life, you won't go back, go back

[Verse]
What would you do if I told you my need to know you
Was as sweet as no one's?
What if a brother was ill enough to kill your fears and lovin' in the convos he brung you was as deep as the condolences from a loved one, I wonder?
What if I told you, I just wanna hold you, until
I know you, And I'd rather know you before we go do what grown ups do, closed room
Post honeymoon, would you
Run away or run up to?
If I gave you the right of way, would you give it up right away like that last scribble with that number two?
Shoot, let's have a, sip from my affection and expound on this new found friendship as we share and reciprocate wisdom
Only difference with my particular curriculum is I'm here to lecture and listen, shawty, get it together
So you can take this as the takin' me, takin' my charm, or take me by the hand or rather arm, and hold me tighter than a hope, of this potential bond can be if you honestly ponderin', callin' on me
See right now, the only thing between us makin' universe smile, is what you want me to call you 10 hours after you give me them 10 numbers to dial, and if
It's any consolation, I feel some type of havin' some type of honour in havin' a conversion with a number 10 right now
I see you later and see if you like it
See you later, see if you love it
See you later, you can see some effort
I see you later, so, so much, you wanna see me forever
That's all the advice I got

[Chorus]
Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it
Good dick and advice, I got you
If you need it in your life, I got that
I might put it in your life, you won't go back, go back
Come and talk to me, I'm serious, yeah
Come and talk to me, I'm curious, yeah
Money I can bring but I'm serious, yeah
Shawty, I can bring you somethin' different, look
Listen to me, good dick and advise, I got that
Good dick and advice, I'm 'bout it
