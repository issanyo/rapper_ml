[Verse 1: Wale]
Late night, my six on patron
I'm perusing the phone
She pick up and it's on
It's on me
The song is only
To paint a poem, boys that talk but lack 'g'
Back to the man, yee
Scripted, I read
Feeding them sweet nothing that a hungry broads to eat
Rugged or playful is not the problem Naw
It's how say it for they start scarfing
Yet you offer them nothing
Offer 'em a conference call with your partners
Got you showing off but the sky's that bark
Baby I'm a dawg but the broad never knew it
When it comes to the game I'm 2 moves sooner
Sooner enough to be an OU student
Ho you got caught
Joe you stupid
Never knew cupid
And even if I did know he not shooting
I'm too ruthless...

[Talking 1: Wale]
Got to keep on proceeding with the procedure
You know what I'm saying
Put some motion in the emotion
I get sick on this side
I can't wait for you... LOOK
Lemme show you

[Verse 2: Wale]
Now lemme tell you how I am going
Goadomes on me
Got so many hoes, I can dodge her like Nomo
And no more for them broke joes, Oh no
You ain't know baby girl you my Wachov -I -A I-E give it to me
I ain't tryna chase kitties, You can leave on the vickies
Ain't trynna have quickie, I'm tryna to have you quickly
Decide on many 50s and 5s
And 20s and 10s and 100s
She can fit when see getting the ride
You can call me whatever but I ain't getting around
See I'm not then other brothas, I don't kiss anymore
I'm something like a protractor I be getting around, Yea
And baby girl I ain't playing
One line and I'm finished like I'm playing in a maze
Say the amazing Wale Folarin, is anything less than great
Check your larynx, [clears throat]
Check your esophagus
Hot when I land, like Island Galapagos
I am the prodigal, we stackin up that guacamole
Like that taco B-E, double L
One hell of a dope MC
Them brothas getting sour at the cream, well sorry to tortilla
But the tutorial on cheese will proceed...
And those who don't listen guarantee, U will be retaught... or retort
You all held back, while the class flip tassels and throw away hats
I throw away hassle and disregard rush
Wheelchair on poise, use patience as a crutch
