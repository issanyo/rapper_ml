[Intro: Omarion]
Ah fuck her, I don't care

[Verse 1: Omarion]
My new lady says she leaving me
Ah fuck her, I don't care
Plus I got another over there
She been wanting to be with me
Got her in her underwear
Gave her what she want, now she need me
I called more up theyâ€™re coming over soon
Lingerie all up in my room
I'mma make this toast to that one girl I love
I still smell her perfume

[Bridge: Omarion]
Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, no pour another
Numbing up

[Hook: Omarion]
Since you've been away, love's been M.I.A
M.I.A., M.I.A., M.I.A
Done looking for love, cause she took away her
Now I'm M.I.A., M.I.A
No love, no love
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love
Fuck her, I don't care

[Verse 2: Omarion]
My new lady says she leaving me
Ah fuck her I don't care
Told me that she loved me, yeah
I just give them the scenery, they won't ever compare
To the ones still got it
I call her up but she won't answer
And she knows what I'm looking for
And she knows what I'm looking for

[Bridge: Omarion]
Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, no pour another
Pour one up, no pour another
Numbing up

[Hook: Omarion]
Since you've been away, love's been M.I.A
M.I.A., M.I.A., M.I.A
Done looking for love, cause she took away her
Now I'm M.I.A., M.I.A
No love, no love
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love
Fuck her, I don't care

[Verse 3: Wale]
I be your rolling stone, missus, still tryna deal with ya
Loving too much will leave you blue and I ain't pledge Sigma
I'm a real nigga, giving feelings just ain't me
The more attention you give em, the more options they seek
Talk is cheap, knew I should've kept the receipt
She said she loyal, but all bitches gonna talk in the streets
That's how I play it, how I play it, all it is is game
As I hit another paper plane I'm MIA

[Hook: Omarion]
Since you've been away, love's been M.I.A
M.I.A., M.I.A., M.I.A
Done looking for love, cause she took away her
Now I'm M.I.A., M.I.A
No love, no love
Done looking for love, cause she took away her love
Fuck her, I don't care
