[Verse 1: Miguel]
Hey kid, shake it loose together
The spotlight's hitting something
That's been known to change the weather
We'll kill the fatted calf tonight, so stick around
You're going to hear electric music
Solid walls of sound

[Chorus: Miguel]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Be-Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Be-Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets

She's so good
She's so good, yeah
Yeah
Alright, here we go

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Hey kid, plug into the faithless (into the faithless)
Maybe they're blinded
But Bennie makes them ageless
We shall survive, let us take ourselves along (Let us take ourselves along), Yeah
Where we fight our parents out in the streets
To find out who's right and who's wrong

[Chorus: Miguel]
Say, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
Oh, but they're so spaced out
Be-Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets
Yeah, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Be-Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets
Ah!,  so good

[Verse 3: Wale]
Better keep one rolled and heard she’s back
In a mohair suit signing autographs
She hates the media, it brings her down
But when you this hot you gonna need your fans
Make a flip flop when your CD out
She was eating up but you anemic now
You believe in luck, a religion babe
Because either way you gonna need it now (now,now,now)
Now
They can build you up so they can break you down (down,down,down)
Yeah
Cry tears of joy so they can see you drown (drown, drown, drown)
Yeah
Chew you up only to spew you out (out, out, out)
You are now a victim of the in crowd
And music has lost its soul
And the female’s selling sex and no content on getting old
So they concerts aren't as sold
So the concern is on they labels
That we pay them to perform
See, the way this game is set up
We can’t let this show go on, no
Who going to love them when the party’s over
I’m saying everybody love them but nobody know them
I’m saying everybody know you but nobody need you
So will she still be in your heart when she is not in your speakers?
Believe it

[Chorus: Miguel]
Oh, Candy and Ronnie, have you seen them yet
But they're so spaced out
Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets
Oh, but they're weird and they're wonderful
Oh, Bennie, she's really keen
She's got electric boots, a mohair suit
You know I read it in a magazine
Be-Be-Bennie and the Jets

[Verse 4: Miguel]
Hey Bennie (Bennie)
Oh Bennie (Bennie, Bennie and the Jets)
Oh, you look so good on that stage, baby, yeah
Hey Bennie, oh Bennie, yeah Bennie, Bennie
Bennie and the Jets baby
Oh my God, yeah
Bennie( Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie and the Jets)
Oh, do you think we'll meet up after the show?
I sure hope so now
Yeah, she makes the mohair suit look so good
So good
(Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie, Bennie,Bennie)
I mean, where do you get a mohair suit anyway? Ah man
Bennie and the Jets baby
(Bennie and the Jets)
Yeah yeah, oh my God (Bennie)
Rock on, alright
(Bennie and the Jets)
Wild times
Right times
