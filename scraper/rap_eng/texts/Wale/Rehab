[Hook]
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said 'no, no, no'
Yes I've been black but when I come back you'll know know know
I ain't got the time and if my daddy thinks I'm fine
He's tried to make me go to rehab but I won't go go go

[Verse 1: Amy Winehouse]
I'd rather be at home with Ray
I ain't got seventy days
Cause there's nothing
There's nothing you can teach me
That I can't learn from Mr Hathaway
I didn't get a lot in class
But I know it don't come in a shot glass

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Wale!
They say I got a problem
This liquor keep on callin'
My name's Wale (Hi Wale!)
I'm a hiphopaholic
Hip Hip Anon must miss me
This a feinin' verse and chorus
Yeah I'm a bartender they tend to fork over fortunes
Money cannot support him
Shaking I hear the voices
I am an addict that of which I'm endorsing
Them twelve steps is nothing
How many more of them?
I gotta shake the habit so add me four more of them
Sixteen bars
Jack Dan of the rap song
Ain't nothing sweet over here - you niggas mad, dog
I know the arrogant love me. I'm Guinness Stoutto 'em
So ima be here - like glass foam
OK! Three cheers! What the coldest of flows
And to those that's hating? I propose you a toast
I suppose you presume ready to rewind now
I'm good with bars why wouldn't I love that wine house?
Out
