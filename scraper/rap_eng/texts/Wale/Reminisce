[Intro: Wale]
When they reminisce over you
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God, my God, my God

[Hook: Wale]
When they reminisce over you
Those be the last words they tell us in this recording booth

[Verse 1: Wale]
Try not to fall in love but shawty be coming through
Her jeans and undergarments, how I'm supposed to move?
And all you weak bitches just power tripping, confused
Not a weak one in my days, a month of them in your crew
I got DC locked, you probably see me out
She want turn up and turn my uh to a beat box
Pardon if I'm vulgar, but I pull up with a chauffeur
And I pull up all alone but nigga, I'm never loafing
My shooters on the wing like I'm some kind of point guard
Head and tail daily, but baby, no coin toss
A couple choice words have that woman choice off
That mean chose up, but her compasses always lost
I'm up in Maxfield's swiping 'til the max filled
New Romanelli jacket, man that actor's got skills
Play Godzilla 'til you climb the wrong building
Play me for a pussy, have you pushing daffodil up
Rap skills nothing, I won't hold you, they bluffing
Them losers in a cell, just know that bail coming
It's bitches in my cell, they know that they smell the money
And I'm swimming in pussy, niggas getting Ocean 11'd, whatever

[Hook: Wale]
When they reminisce over you
Those be the last words they tell us in this recording booth

[Verse 2: Wale]
See I propel niggas by dropping genius and jewels
And I can tell a woman ambition just by her shoes
703, 301 and 202
Even if I quit, just know it always will be Olu's (you lose)
Look at my contribution
Still I remained a lyrical conscience of my platoon
I pray my niggas sitting, your commissary is Gucci
Used to be clothes, cars but now it's cookies and noodles
Look how far I pursued it, Allah pushing me through it
Inshallah my Naira too high, bawo ni nigga
I'm like Olamide, Jay and Pac, I'm kinda different
Might pop up in agbada, red carpet and mschew him
Shout out ruvilla, my bottle rockers is killing
I turn them new Jordan's, to Ron Harper's, my nigga
Don't start with it nigga, might stop it my nigga
No doctor or mixologist got the shots I distribute
See I just wanted Sasha Banks and massages for dinner
I just wanna win and pray to God that y'all remember

[Hook: Phil Ade & (Wale)]
Reminisce in the morning
(When they reminisce over you)
I pray to the Lord, keep blessing me
These niggas they all keep testing me
And I ain't trip in the morning
(When they reminisce over you)
I got all my lights in here
I got all my hearts to give
Reminisce in the morning
(When they reminisce over you)
Reminisce in the morning
Reminisce in the morning
Reminisce in the morning
I got all my hearts to give
