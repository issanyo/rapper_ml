[Wale]
Four three my grammy people
And we don't even need no grammy neither
KB did it with dream nigga I seen him
And he gone do same for me believe that
Believe it some niggas is sleeping
They high off something get off of that weed bitch
They whole flow dry like they eating speedstick
I've unleashed the mixtape the feigns need that
Believe it my grammy people
Haters gotta stomach me I am a fetus
Niggas getting hungry for me ima feed them
Love to hate on the way eat the appetizer
And we up but they ain't believe us till they check the BDS about my two singles
Which means im single handedly
Proving disbelievers that said that they can't be
DC will never make it thats was they was chanting
Now they all calling KB and talking about me
Saying a nigga hot lets get him up out here
Man before you talk better bring that cheese
And the album finished we don't need no wack features
We keep it going getting dough in DC cause
Four three my grammy people
I swear a nigga done but could move about 3 mil
We still the flyest you gone find
The CEO is younger than artist they just signed
And we don't gotta sign my nigga we just fine
Cause we ain't getting shelved we got too much pride
Do it for our town they gone hold us both down
We gone keep throwing shows then be selling those out
Thought you fucking with the flow but you celibate now
Any nigga who ain't down is irrelevant now
Wale is headed for stardom
I'm on my opponents the bars are flawless
My name mean a lot make sure that you call it right
I keep it tighter than storage from lawyers
I am the sorcerer my words more awesome than yours is
Thats why I talk through the chorus
Four trey my grammy people
Impeccable sneakers im better than eva
Equal to none I kick it like fifa
Official like whistles from referees young
The best to speak such corrupted leisure
Conduct what yall think is easily Jesus's work
Wale don't be in the beef young
I roll with some niggas that'll make em vegan
See them the greatest latest
Shoutout to Kanye L.A was major
The labels not hip
Flyer than pilots
The industry don't acknowledge my town so I vent
Four three my grammy people
And I don't need no grammy neither
I see it my peeps cool and my family eat good
Ima continue to move nigga ima sleep good
So we good my grammy family
Labels on pop like candy when ants be
Crawling to all of they artist is all sweet
They got they deal from hook ups mines is all street
Shoutout to Cool, Blaze and my man Greg Street
And all the city niggas my folks on NT
I'm NT seven days out the week
That you ain't gone find shopping UAT
W the trouble you in is ji deep
10 deep the hoodie the kicks is two Gs
Hotter than a sauna summer in Tempe
Attentively hottest nigga to see
Arguably top six inside the whole east
My goals fully expose the bulk of DC
Old folks is blown cause holmes is not peaked
Alone in these streets opponents so weak
Love even the haters don't focus on beef
Its cold but its deep but fuck it its on me
Its nothing I keep it coming studio four three
Studio four three
