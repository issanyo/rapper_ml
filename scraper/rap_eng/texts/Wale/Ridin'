[Intro: Wale]
DC, Maryland, Virginia stand up
XO, Wale

[Verse 1: Uptown XO]
Georgetown shopping, Uptown grinding
Southside riders, funel easy widers
Funny people find us, funny but outside us
Feel safer when they outside of the climate
Raised in a hostile environment, got wild and violent
Almost got shot, silenced
That's when I was riding with the heat
The man that shot was on the other side of the street
Didn't wanna tell mom then, I was grinding my teeth
My soul had questions, got advice from the streets
And my advice was to eat
But I miss those days, cause the prices was cheap
Back then black Timbs made my cypher complete
Those days were so great, priceless to me
Glad to be alive in the bar like "no ice in that, please"
About to make a toast to life but I can die when I leave

[Hook]
If you wanna take a ride, we can ride (ride)
If you wanna take a ride then we can ride (ride)
If you wanna take a ride, we can ride (ride)
If you wanna take a ride, we can ride (ride)

[Verse 2: Wale]
And I'mma ride 'til the wheels ain't wheels, and your own
Tend to keep my heels on they heels, I fear no
Evil near me, never ever, we so clear from the negative
My Jesus emblem has a double meaning
Positively I proceed with caution
DC good with them [mad gum?] flosses
Brothers on papers and others got warrants
And the radio ignore the local runt reporters
The bulk of our reporters
Don't ever leave the hood like the crooked cops that want us
Look around where you walk to the District
Where a hater hate a nigga, nigga this is nothing normal
Victor and Jamaal, XO or Folarin
The north left side venturin' off Georgia
Mention my name, his soul meet the lord
His corpse meet the morgue
Get the tank on fool, we can ride

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Uptown XO]
Ridin' and smokin niggas for rollers that's rollin'
God gave me dice, I shook 'em up, rolled them
Devil's still datin', Po-Po patrollin'
Posted on the block, never loaf in my emotions
Express through whatever I wrote, and you can quote him
That uptown soldier boy'a Super Soak them
Rap Superman, they superficial
Gotta trust to your G's
We too official, the newer issue
Peep the cover, go through the pages, rippin' stages
What I did on the block used to be my résumé
Learned as I aged, God is my agent
Of course they want my corpse in a sport we playin' in
Made the bed, we gotta lay in it
And I'm ridin' on a road hotel, Holiday Inn
Away from home, but home is where the heart is
I'm never heartless, a real nigga roadtrip
You rode it, come on

[Hook]
