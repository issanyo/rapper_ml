CHORUS
I HATE IT WHEN YOU LEAVE ME IN THE MORNING *3
(SHE SAID)

VERSE (WALE A)
ALARM IS GOING OFF
I KEEP ON HITTING SNOOZE
IM TRYING HARD TO SOAK UP EVERY MOMENT NEXT TO YOU
BODIES TANGLED IN THE BED
I’M KISSING AND UNRAVELING YOUR LEGS
BUT CAN YOU BLAME ME, LOOK AT YOU GIRL
I SWEAR TIME STOPS WHEN I LOOK AT YOU GIRL
EVERY THOUGHT I HAVE IS ABOUT YOU GIRL
LIKE I AM NOTHING WITHOUT YOU GIRL
SHE SAID ME TOO AND THAT’S THE REASON WHY

CHORUS
I HATE IT WHEN YOU LEAVE ME IN THE MORNING *3
(SHE SAID)

VERSE 2 (D’AFRICAN)
DAMN, IM STUCK IN YOUR VORTEX
WE FUCKED ALL NIGHT AND AGAIN IN THE MORNING AND STILL IM ASKING FOR MORE SEX
I WAKE TO KISSES ON THE NAVEL
WAY BEFORE THE LABEL
FREAKING IN THE KITCHEN KNOCKING DISHES OFF THE TABLE, DAMN
I HAVE TO TIDY UP BEFORE I LEAVE
LEAVE, DAMN WHY DO I HAVE TO LEAVE?
OH CAUSE THE MONEY CALLS
AND YOU KNOW I HAVE TO ANSWER
BUT BEFORE I GO I ROLL A SWISHER AND ROMANCE HER
ANS SHE SAYS THAT WHY

CHORUS
I HATE IT WHEN YOU LEAVE ME IN THE MORNING *3
(SHE SAID)

VERSE 3
(D’AFRICAN)
IM STILL PUSHING ON THAT SNOOZE BUTTON
I LOVE SLEEPING IN BUT WHO DOESN'T
(WALE A)
ESPECIALLY WHEN NEXT TO ME, LIES THE PERFECT SPECIMEN
IT’S SPECIAL WHEN YOU’RE LOVER AND YOU’RE BEST OF FRIENDS
BUT LOOK AT YOU GIRL
NEVER SEEN ANYONE LIKE YOU GIRL
THERE ISN'T ANYONE LIKE YOU GIRL
COULD SPEND ALL DAY AND NIGHT WITH YOU GIRL
BUT I HAVE TO GO AND THAT’S THE REASON WHY
