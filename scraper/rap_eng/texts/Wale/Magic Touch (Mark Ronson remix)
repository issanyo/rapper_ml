I can make the pain disappear
And I can erase the past, oh!
I can make the future shine so bright
And I can make right now alright, yeah

I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl

All I got is concrete all around me, woo
But I can see the countryside
You can be rich when youre poor and poor when youre rich
It can be raining and I can make the sun shine

I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl

I know sometimes, sometimes you feel no hope
Well Ive been there, Ive walked that lonely road, ooh
I took whatever devil offered me
Because I knew that he would set me free, oh!

I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl

Science, they can't prove it
But I know I can do it
I can fly, I can bend metal with my mind
I can wake up in a paradise, oh!

We got that magic, we got that magic
We got that magic, we got that magic
We got that magic, we got that magic
We got that magic, we got that magic

I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic, girl
I got it, you got it, we got the magic every day
