[Intro: Wale]
The goal is to never be content with the present (with the present)
We move fast (We move fast) We think forward (we think forward)
Cloudeater (Cloudeater) Folarin (Folarin)

[Verse 1: Wale]
Always with something newer
Whoever know their music know I'm the fuckin' manure
Uh okay, this is something you never knew
I'm part of a special crew of niggas that just reppin' too hard
Yea, BIG got the youth in this motherfucker
Future, the musicians out the loop when they bar stuggling
I'm like a difficult pictureless puzzle spittin' rebuttal
Pray you niggas don't never love us, you niggas is sucka's
I'm shiftin' faces
Bitches give me physical favors
Fresh as the first day of school, peep this orientation
Syllabusin' me silly brother syllable suckin'
Counterproductive, they silly bitches give me production
B-b-b-b-beat it
She think between her legs, she a fuckin' vagenius
I ain't coming to bed, I ain't coming with bread
'Less you know what you're doin' girl, I don't come off the head, na
You won't come off the red
I'ma blow out some loud, y'all can come out with reg
You can be all alone, I'ma be in my zone
I'ma watch me some Shone while y'all can covet the throne (Y'all can covet the throne)

[Chorus: Cloudeater]
Shif-ting Fa-ces
Shif-ting Fa-ces
Shif-ting Fa-ces
I can't place it
Shif-ting Fa-ces
Shif-ting Fa-ces
Shif-ting Fa-ces
I can't place it

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uh, always with something newer
Chasin' this revenue never put it over this music
Word to my mother, these motherfuckers ain't fuckin' with this
I'm young living comfortable get these niggas up out my business
Ultra division they rarely am my competition
Hear what I'm smokin' my eyes low as a sock in sneaker
Not a clipper but I Paul over when I ball
Pay regards before you talk you just a Portis on my board
Put your shorty in this Audi got like 40 on my arm
With this audio I'm sick, leave that audience in awe
And this genre needs some change can we be frank it need faith
Get that head like DDT let these bitches feel the snake
UCB toward man Fendi belts to show my ass
Liquor lifted with these bitches they gon' prolly catch a cab
Swear that Pac would love my flow, I'm a Marley without my hat
Swear that B.I.G. would love my clothes, this is far beyond that rap
So much wack shit y'all be hearin' it's so hard to get ya'll back
My disclaimer I don't blame ya, just go harder on the track
Put my heart in vivid pictures and artists
Reppin' that double MM, gettin' money regardless
Whether these niggas like it, I'm modifying the genre
Ask me why am I whispering 'cause nigga I'm tired of talking
Bring drums, bring drums, uh, bring drums, uh

[Chorus: Cloudeater]
Shif-ting Fa-ces
Shif-ting Fa-ces
Shif-ting Fa-ces
I can't place it
Shif-ting Fa-ces
Shif-ting Fa-ces
Shif-ting Fa-ces
I can't place it
