[Intro - Michael Richards]
Shut up! 50 years ago, they'd have you upside down with a fucking fork up your ass! You can talk, you can talk, you can talk, you're brave now, motherfucker! Throw his ass out. He's a nigga! He's a nigga! He's a nigga! A nigga, look, there's a nigga!

[Wale]
The color of my skin, content of my character
Dream of a King's been a nightmare for anyone
White with a badge or anyone
Slightly affected by the tide to this race that I'm running in
Pardon me, y'all, the racists I run against
The race war, when it's us against all of them
They subconsciously low talk us
And probably all think as Kramer did still but won't talk it
And first off, I ain't trying to be conscious
Speaking heart with a conscious, talking to you
This dark content for those of dark complexion
Who's x-ed off, Rip, who gon' listen to us?
Who gon' speak for us? Who gon' plead for us?
Who gon' be the Head N.I.C. for us?
Who gon' defend us from crooked police on us?
I'm just an insecure N.I.G. er

Please listen to me, please listen to me
Please listen to me, N.I.G. er
Please listen to me, who gon' listen to me?
Who gon' listen to me, N.I.G. er
Listen to me, who gon' listen to me?
Who gon' listen to me, N.I.G. er
Who gon' listen to me, who gon' listen to me?
Who gon' listen to me, N.I.G

Hey
And P say that I should stop saying nigga
But if I did, what would be the difference?
I'd still be a nigga, he'd still be a nigga in his feelings
I'd still be a nigga with no deal tryna get one
There'd still be niggas out killing
And still be white people still out to get us
And still be niggas saying whites tryna get us
And still be lazy and paranoid niggas
I'm paramount, nigga, I am, and you can't be mad
'Cause I choose the word nigga, lemme air it out, nigga
Nigga ain't bad, see, niggas just had
A clever idea to take something They said
Into something we have, something we flipped
Into something with swag, nigga, don't be mad
Bitches ain't shit, but women ain't bitches
See, women are the queens, and bitches just bitches
And bitches say bitch like bitch is not offensive
When niggas say bitch, all of the sudden, they offended
And niggas say nigga to a nigga
A nigga write nigga in a lyric, expect the white boy to omit it
The white boy spit it like he spit it
Recite it to his friends who, by the way, ain't niggas
And say nigga, nigga, nigga, my favorite rapper did it
And non-nigga friends got it with him
Incorporate this lyric to their everyday living
Until a black friend kinda hear it, just a tidbit
He thinks Aw, forget it, its so insignificant and little
The white boy sees this as a clearance, now its
Nigga, nigga, nigga, every single day
And that little nigga nigga, thinks its okay
And he's the only nigga in this particular grade
And it begins to phase him more each day
The things they say went a little too far
He couldn't tell the difference between an a or er
So they just keep going, saying nigga in his face
There's nothing he can do, he let it get away
It came to the point he couldn't look 'em in the face
The mirror made him hurl, his reflection disgraceful
Yeah, and make sure everything you say
Can't be held against you in any kind of way
And any connotation is viewed many ways
'Cause under every nigga, there's a little bit of Kramer
Self-hatred...I hate you...and myself
Niggas

[Outro - Michael Richards]
Uh, I lost my temper onstage, I was at, uh, a comedy club trying to, um, do my act and I got heckled and I, I, I took it badly and went into a, a rage...and uh, uh...said some pretty, uh...nasty things to some Afro-Americans, a lot of trash talk...for this to happen, for me to be in a comedy club and flip out and say this crap, you know, I'm...I'm deeply, deeply sorry
