[Intro]
Basically like it's this big DC Baltimore like, myth thing
But it really is no tension
Even though 92Q does not play my records
And I do not know why
But uh, yea they don't play my records
My cousin who plays Chris Partlow is in the studio right now
He's not gunna do no drop, cuz we don't give a fuck about that shit in our family
Um, only thing that's important to us is just making sure you bring like plantain on Thanksgiving
But anyways, um, so 92Q don't play my records, and I don't know why
It's all good, I love Baltimore, I got a lot of friends
You know, I'm saying I know a lot of the um, 5 percenters that's out in Baltimore
Shout out my man, Los
Um you know, shout out K-swift
She's not a 5 percenter but shout her out
Scottie B what up
Um you know, Mark Clark, J Claxton
Pork Chop, Shawn J
Um you know, everybody I see you out there
Bossman, Mulli-man, everybody out there doing their thing, whatever
But, I just wish I could get some more love on the radio Baltimore
You know and it's all good, man I'm 5 minutes away
Man I'm in Largo, Maryland, man I'm like 10 minutes on 95
So I made this little song, me and Scottie B put this shit together

[Hook]
Du-duh duh, Du-duh duh, Du-duh duh (x8)
This what I call the ELEVATOR!
This what I call the ELEVAATTTORRR!
YOU! You know!
YOU! You, you YOU KNOW!
YOU! You know!
YOU! You, you YOU KNOW!
WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA
WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA, WA!

[Verse 1 - Wale]
Time after time, my timing impeccable
Peek at the time, mind invincible
Round and round, I'm here to sphere the squares
And clear the air
My circumference, y'all can't near
I'm in here like antlers
Yea, I am out of this world
Literally, out of my dome
Out of my mind, making it harder to breathe
Nigga I'm Adam Levigne
This is a breeze to me, the industry
I read you niggas like literature
Gucci sneaks, my green is up
My Leisure suit, I BBC
Yea, me on the BBC and El Dien with Mark, and them

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Wale]
KICKS!
Don't know the cost of them
Cuz those don't fall til' August here
Then! Whenever August here, I'm walking in my March apparel
Yea, nigga I'm eons away
Proven my case, I feed off a J
Hov, yea, Mr. Carter
Aristocrat for Hip-hop artists
Sip the Merlot, grip a darling
Darling you in the game, I'm balling
No, I ain't your man from Harlem, Joe
I'm on a roll, of margarine, no
No longer a nigga is starving
So, I could share money with all them
Like, like, my niggas who need it
I be the reason niggas believe in

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Wale]
Nigga believe in, follow the leader
Raunsh a dat a cleaning NO (???)
Excuse my speech, but climber know
Freaks to me is dominoes
Down a ho, you don a ho
I pounce a ho, then vamanos
Sitting, you talking, you Donna Hue
Nigga, I look like a don to you
A darker hue, I'm sharp as Hue
I'm Shaq to your Udonis dudes
Donatello, I off the disc
You are convinced that I'm the shit
If time's sufficient enough, revisit the track
And tell me I'm wack, you lying
Tell me you bustin' your gats, you lying
Niggas is runnin' they trap in line
Nigga I'm Nas, niggas is Pras
Nigga I'm Nas, niggas is Pras
Nigga I'm Nas, niggas is Pras
Nigga I'm Nas, niggas is Pras
Well ah, hell well
Well ah, hell well
Well ah, hell well
Well ah, hell well
Fine, fuck it, done fin
Fine, fuck it, done fin
Fine, fuck it, done fin
Fine, fuck it, done fin
Fine, fuck it, done fin

Fine, fuck it, done fin
