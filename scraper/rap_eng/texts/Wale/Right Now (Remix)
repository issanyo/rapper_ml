[Verse 1: Trevor Jackson]
Just stand right here
Let me show you what I'm 'bout to do to that body
And come down here
Let me show you where to touch my body
Let the foreplay begin
Bet you never had this before
'Cause once I go in
I'm gon' have you beggin' for more

[Chorus: Trevor Jackson]
Girl, I'm talking right now, right now, right now, yeah
Right now, oh
Can we make some love right now
Like right now, right now, right now, ooh
Right now, oh
Can we make some love like, right now
Right now, now, now
Right now, now, now
Oh yeah, like right now, right now, right now, ooh (yeah)
Yeah, I'm talking like, right now (shit)
Right now yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Right now, now
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Wale]
Ah, Folarin, genius
I'm tryna activate your passion, baby
She lacks the waist, and me, I lack the patience
I like you, but I lust you more, but always that can change
I mean the sex gon' be crazy, but stay for conversation
Hold up, I'm talkin' right now, right now, right now, right now
Separate your thighs unless that vibe is indecisive
Me, I can take my time, I take my time, 'cause time is priceless
We, we can wine and dine or I'll just just dine while you divide it
Me, I be willin', I know, young Folarin, the G.O.A.T
On her comments, I post, make her undergarments get soaked
Black Bonnie, I like you but offer me more
Women kickin' for clout with me, say they tryna be goals
Me, I'd rather be closer, you'll be my gravity though
Hold me down, what I mean, and feed me your passion and never ask me, I'd rather me show
Now you laughin' as our attraction is gradually close
Wale Folarin the poet, Mr. Jackson Shamone

[Chorus: Trevor Jackson]
Girl, I'm talking right now, right now, right now, yeah
Right now, oh (oh, yeah)
Can we make some love right now
I said right now, right now, right now, ooh
Right now, oh
Can we make some love like, right now
Right now, now, now
Right now, now, now, now
Oh yeah, like right now, right now, right now, ooh (yeah)
Yeah, I'm talking like, right now (shit)

[Bridge: Trevor Jackson]
Yeah, we really touching now
Hands all on your body going up and down, while you up and down
Babe you know I love it when you make that sound
Yeah, we making love right now
Said, we really touching now
Hands all on your body going up and down (hands all on your body, yeah)
While you up and down
Girl, you know I love it when you make that sound (that sound the love we making)
Yeah, we making love right now
Right now, baby ooh
I don't think I can wait another day

Right now, ooh, oh yeah
Right now

[Outro: Trevor Jackson]
Touching, girl you do that
Promise I won't beat, your body too wet
Keep it one hunned, girl I'm the truest
I ain't never been lately, got the true insane
Oh baby girl, let's do this
And don't forget to bite your lips
Let's begin
