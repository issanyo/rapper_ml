"oh oh oh oh
Yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah
Oh oh oh oh"


I turned my tv on 
For the first time in some months
To see some bull shit on
These niggas walking with cunts
These niggas losing their lives
Cops flexing their guns
A Race War In my sight
Or it's already begun
Government gathering Guns
My Niggas Looking For Clips
Feeling Like Home Runs
Hoping they don't get hit
Hoping they don't get clipped
Yeah
Cause Black Lives Matter
Said that with some pride
Til Homie pulled out the hammer
He pressed me for my bread
He's Struggling for pampers
His baby slept on his bed
His sheets only get damper
The Hood don't got no Santa
But when will we see
When we only believe what gets caught on camera

Babylon, aka the city of confusion
Palimpsest throughout the great vine and now i see infusion
Realities now illusions
People lost in confusion
Could be as blunt as a dime
But i think I'd rather allude it
Moral , more and values
Altered by these depictions
American dreams and how you
Eventually spend your riches
What it takes to go and get it
Haters, and losing friendships
With people who hate to see you
Become someone who's different
Does money change them or does it change you ?
Scattered faces different places
Thats what change do
The same rope we climb up on to elevate ourselves they'll take it and tie a noose just to hang you
Hang you
But chase success I know you willing
Cause a lifestyle different from yours is so appealing
These Images pumped in our mind steady instilling
Roles for young men, young women and all our children


Conundrum!
Conundrum!
Fuck I gotta spell it or something nigga?
Conundrum!
(Yeah)
Conundrum!

So as I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I shall fear no evil
But this shit ain't see through
Some get poked with needles
Snort white like The Beetles
Some love that money
Some roll that weedo
Hoping that this hold on life
Don't slip and free you
Flirting with Kin Evils
Can't let them beat you
A few love the game
Most battling demons
Know em by they name
No time to live in shame
I get to bustin and squeezing
I get to bustin they leaking
I get to palming they reaping
I seen them niggas they creeping
Told him gimme a reason
This trigger finger ain't stable
Nigga I'll do em in Vain
With this trigger Im Able
To take a life,  Cuz I Cain
Nigga fuck is you saying
Man this clip hold sins
So wear yo vest like a chain
And get low like you praying
Cause this thunder is coming
And this lightening is slaying
You either dying or running nigga
Cause when the time comes are you elevating?
Are you...
Left Here to die, yeah That Revelation
I'm giving you armageddon is it resignating?
Is it heaven or hell you're anticipating?
Play these words back loud Imma wake a nation
I build these  words like bricks
But nah i ain't a Mason
Put the flame to the spliff the bottom burns like Satan
Use your brain in this music nigga
You might even lose it nigga

Conundrum!
Conundrum!
Fuck I gotta spell it or something nigga?
Conundrum!
(Yeah)
Conundrum!
