[Verse 1]
Bitches on my line, this a probate
H2O flow and I don't hold gate
This is no trial, this a closed case
I swear my mans flippin' birds like a road rager
Im no angel, my hoes like a Sega
Streets of Rage 2, I make them hoes skate, don't let the flow escape
Just let me flow above, im blowing loud out the clouds "TURNT UPPPP"
And these worth bucks, fuck ifs or maybes
Yeah surfs up Harlem hoes say I'm "wavy"
LA girls say I'm "hella tight"
I leave a hater like he lost a watermelon fight
Call it what you want I'm what you like
I'm ballin all my life
I'm Sydney Dean ya'll Wesley Snipes
Never really been into the ice
My lady friends never really be into the life
I like a deep thinker,I like a wine drinker
I like a dutty wine bitch with some vagina piercing
I like a good listener,I like a sense of humor
I like a ho that likes a ho just for my amusement
OK, I like to think I'm likable
I like to think I write and rap as tighter than some biker shorts
Don't know why they fightin' fo, dont know why they arguin'
Don't know why you even ask, ain't nobody hot as this
They be on that water here, put a couple in the air
Then they get that chopper like they dont know where a Target is
And I'm shoppin like I don't know where a Target is
Swear a niggas draws be on some stupid Neiman Marcus shit
(Stupid Neiman Markus shit)
Bring the hook,I think I need to spark again

[Hook x2]]
MC'ing ain't dead, but the scenery is different
Let me see some hands for the dope rhyme spitter
Let me see some hands for the dope rhyme spitter
Let me see some hands for the dope rhyme spitter

Uhh! yeah smokin yeah I should stop
Everyday is 420 every moments Woodstock
Everything is good but these haters wish I would stop
Penetrating the culture but I do it til' this Wood Stop, Uhh!
Magnificent, anti-impotent, landslide winning by Lyricist
Got it lock like Styles Sheek Kiss and them
The irony in that is I ain't all about the benjamins
Im all about my woman friend, benefits to get it in
BBM Pinnin me some pictures in they intimates
Womanizing to say the least
And everything after Nautilus ain't a beat
Daytona 5 Grey S5
With the baddest out of 3 dimes Lisa "Left" Eye
My Flow Chilly TBoz
Watch with 30 rocks in it No Peacock, a little NBC talk
I smoke and let the tree talk
I'm goin at the green Rock-steady/Bee-Bop
No Longer do I freestyle, Money for the strippers
They comin after me huh they probably off the dippers
They must come with a bible, swine flu, and a pistol
My side is all riders and your side dont buy tickets

I love them fly swattin bitches, pull my fly down when im wit em'
