[Introduction]
... and they say don't ever change (change on me)
Although beautiful matrimony is a rapper balancing your women, your riches and at least half your homies
You're at the top, don't crack!

[Hook]
I've been doing my own thing
And they said don't never change
And I pray I stay the same
Want everything for everybody 'round me
I've been doing my own thing
And we said we'd never change
And I pray we stay the same
Fame changin' everybody 'round me

[Verse 1]
OK, good business with mad friends (and we said we'd never change)
Or bad business with mad friends, aha, glass egg
Used to be my homie, me and you was chillin' though
Now that shit got cold like the OG with that finger roll
That Spur, probably cop it, 'cause the more I drink Wallace
And it's worse when they even in their fillings of your pockets
Then I got my deal
Started wondering if them hittas with me are for real
Mmm, I figure them'll do it, not us
Mmm, the bond was thick, now just the plot is
And isn't it ironic, getting a name can make you anonymous
My newest of hobbies, collecting calls from the lock-ups
Tell em I know he's so sick of the walls, when he get home, he going shopping
Mmm, look at the time that caught us
Talked to the times while younger and maybe getting your life in order
Real hitta for life, better not look at the price
Better not look at that register, everything in here's light
Mmm, 'cause I'm Jah doin' a'ight
Look at how the moral of the story, but don't see its advice
It's right, it's like life is like a glass egg
Tryna maintain what come with the fame and keeping your last friends
Yeah, you know that balance a bitch
'Cause who on your back or who got your back
I promise the line is this thin, really, really
You know that balance a bitch
'Cause who on your back or who got your back
I promise the line is this thin

[Interlude - Seinfeld]
I got this glass egg somehow on the top of this, balanced
On the top of this mountain, you know?
I don't know how i got it there exactly
But I see it's there and I got to end this with the right feeling

[Hook]
I've been doing my own thing
And they said don't never change
And I pray I stay the same
Want everything for everybody 'round me
I've been doing my own thing
And we said we'd never change
And I pray we stay the same
Fame changin' everybody 'round me

[Verse 2]
OK, good business with mad friends (and we said we'd never change)
Or bad business with mad friends, aha, glass egg
Look at the years invested, who would have figured or guessed it (pa?)
Look at you there since Contra kept the code but youâ€™ve got extra men
Told you I would get this straight, told you once i got big
It's lonely at the top by the population looking in, ahh
Then I got my deal
Started wondering if them hittas with me are for real (sometimes the money let the devil in)
Yeah, now salutations to my former friends
Forming to form against me is currently your form of defense
And now it hurts me to say
Sometimes your sandbox friends equipped for dirty exchange
Now was it worth all that bling in a hurt or sustain at curtain calls
One of two that either boo or bouquets, so was it
Worth of your fam or worth all the fame
Exchange your personal relationships for personal gains
I'm telling you, balance is a bitch
'Cause when you're back, who got your back
I promise the line is this thin, really, uh
I'm telling you, balance is a bitch
'Cause who on your back, and who got your back
Sometimes that line don't exist, I'm out

[Hook]
I've been doing my own thing
And they said don't never change
And I pray I stay the same
Want everything for everybody 'round me
I've been doing my own thing
And we said we'd never change
And I pray we stay the same
Fame changin' everybody 'round me
I've been doing my own thing
And they said don't never change
And I pray I stay the same
Want everything for everybody 'round me
I've been doing my own thing
And we said we'd never change
And I pray we stay the same
Fame changin' everybody 'round me

[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
I've been doing my own thing
And they said don't never change
And I pray we stay the same
I've been doing my own thing
And we said we'd never change
And I pray we stay the same
For the ... 'round me
