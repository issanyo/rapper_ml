[Intro]
That's my name and they know it
The home of the go-go
Forever we are focused
(Wale!)
That's my name and they know it
(Wale!)
That's my name and they know it
GO!

[Verse 1]
Ridin' in that mean joint
Tennis shoes clean
They clinging on a G
Cause the sound so sweet to 'em
If I don't sleep with 'em
I don't got no need for 'em
Mommy what you speaking for
If you ain't trynna leave with us
To the weak youngins
I ain't gonna follow those
Hell no gotta go
Word to my Prada clothes
A popular product in my town
Holmes gotta flow
Cheese call me Papa John
Knock 'em like a domino
All of those hoes, rollers, and gold digging poppin' fors
Yeah I got bread you don't think we going shopping NO!
If we going shopping best believe we gonna change clothes
I'm doing Saks Fifth leave her at the Rainbow
My main focus is I no lie
She better not follow me
This is optometry
DMP 11's that's the only way it's gotta be
Vehicle equivalent I'm sitting on 23's

[Chorus]
Ridin' with my windows down
Everybody see us
And even if they don't they gon' feel it through the speakers
They know me from the rap
4-3 on the sneakers
See it like a G
Dub A-L-E
We be ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some action

[Verse 2]
I am the one yo
She's just a bum joint
Shine 365 holmes I make the sun blown
Green like a lawnmower
Cheese like a mouse home
I could use a mint
Best believe a nigga mouth gross
The onomatopoeias get them Audemars pieces
Matter fact I don't need 'em I just rock my Diesels
Speaking on the beats
I can beat it till it's bleeding
Easily kick it's teeth in
Let me tell you who I is
(WALE!)
Yeah you better act like you know youngin'
Flow cold hold up I think my nose runnin'
The whole Summer they been waiting for a flow youngin'
Georgia to Florida I flossed 'em with something lovely
I am the up and coming
Lovely when I am stunting
Ain't sold a record yet
But money still come in abundance
And I ain't frontin' nuh-uh
And I don't bun 'em nuh-uh
Treat dates likes roommates in shiny numbers

[Chorus]
Ridin' with my windows down
Everybody see us
And even if they don't they gon' feel it through the speakers
They know me from the rap
4-3 on the sneakers
See it like a G
Dub A-L-E
We be ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some action
Ridin' with my windows down
Everybody see us
And even if they don't they gon' feel it through the speakers
They know me from the rap
4-3 on the sneakers
See it like a G
Dub A-L-E
We be ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some action

[Bridge]
Now to the left whip it
To the left whip it
To the left whip it
Don't stop with it
Now to the right whip it
To the right whip it
To the right whip it
You got a right Mrs

[Verse 3]
Black G wagon
Big brother passed it
Cash in my pants
Got the Citizen's saggin'
Yeah I'm that bad
And I'm adamant with fashion
Established
I can bag a broad from a Saturn
But naw I'm in that thing doe
Naw that ain't the same joint
European tag I speak another lingo
Easin' through the lanes
Ya'll lames can't shake through
My name Wale
See you later nigga

[Chorus]
Ridin' with my windows down
Everybody see us
And even if they don't they gon' feel it through the speakers
They know me from the rap
4-3 on the sneakers
See it like a G
Dub A-L-E
We be ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some action
Ridin' with my windows down
Everybody see us
And even if they don't they gon' feel it through the speakers
They know me from the rap
4-3 on the sneakers
See it like a G
Dub A-L-E
We be ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some
Ridin' ridin' ridin' in that black joint lookin' for some action
