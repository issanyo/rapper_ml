Okay I think its time we make moves, no clothes required here
Shawty can I taste you
After that moscato hit
We both grown and I dont care
Not so fast
Dont tie your hair
She said my love is outta here
She out of all her outerwear
And I am real
And I am raw
But dont go in raw
Cuz im prepared
See thats a hazard
If yall ain't know
I got them gold wrappers
Like 500 sold
Got that deep love
Purify that woman soul
Get it so good I make the mufucka somersault
Tell me anything you want
Ima keep that on the low
I jus wanna please you so
Tell me where I need to go
Downtown, downtown
I know that you is freaky so
If your man can't keep up wit you
Then I think he need to go
Downtown, downtown
I know that you is freaky so
If your man can't keep up wit you
Put my number in your phone
