[Hook: Rick Ross]
They askin' questions and I heard they even lookin' for me
Ridin' up and down the block, they showin' pictures of me
Stash 100,000 in my momma china cabinet
First one with the Rollie with the hundred carets
I'mma make it work, I'mma make it work
Diamonds all on my hands, know I make it work
I'mma make it work, time to make it work
100 carets in the Rollie, I'mma make it work

[Break: Rick Ross]
Do your job and I'mma do mine
From the dice to the diamonds
Matchbox to the penthouse

[Hook: Rick Ross]
They askin' questions and I heard they even lookin' for me
Ridin' up and down the block, they showin' pictures of me
Stash 100,000 in my momma china cabinet
First one with the Rollie with the hundred carets
I'mma make it work, I'mma make it work
Diamonds all on my hands, know I make it work
I'mma make it work, time to make it work
100 carets in the Rollie, I'mma make it work

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
MIA with my woes, zak pase to my Zoes
When they talk with that stick, spin the corner reload
I heard niggas talking that shit, we gon' pull up on 'em G code
Just to ask him what he said, what you think he did he froze
Like a bitch nigga, the only is I wish niggas
Play with me and play with me and stay with me all day with meI clip niggas
Check this I get money ain't told no snitch nigga
You mad cause I'm on now get my dick sucked like a rich nigga
Move work like '88, cuban link like '92
Move weight like Ricky Lake, my chick, 10, 5 times 2
Do I have to remind you what that 45 and that 9 do
Pull up in the Maybach with that thing back and recline you, pussy
I'mma make it work, I'mma make it work
Pussy rapper say my name you only made it worse
You only made it worse
Pull up in that holy ghost and take 'em straight to church
I'mma make it work, I'mma make it work
My shooter prolly smack your bitch up even take her purse

[Verse 3: Wale]
See the flow, up close you can't see the flow
Bitch I got more bunnies than grandmamas rocking Easter clothes
You care for that 2 step you [?] Tim Hardaway
Cross nigga y'all fraud niggas, I fade away and you ball away
Please tell me where shawty stay please tell me where shawty live
Your boyfriend be past tense cause my stroke game might pass your ribs
Oh, oh fuck 'em up, oh, oh, fuck with me
Blue oh, she comfortable with you she 17
I'm the man to see when you in DC
[?] Trel in the [?]
I'm either Malcom or Martin shawty I still talk to my enemies
MMG you end the beef MMG we still a team
I've been rocking with the 3rd ward since new Girbauds and Soulja Rees
Bosses out call Ross out and [?] get the Porshe up
Call the hood get a black bottle like a nigga got an endorsement
Give her dick cause she gorgeous can't give her my joystick
Young Bre keeps gunplay still down for that extortion
They want shit I got

[Hook: Rick Ross]
They askin' questions and I heard they even lookin' for me
Ridin' up and down the block, they showin' pictures of me
Stash 100,000 in my momma china cabinet

Diamonds all on my hands, know I make it work

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Ain't no pressure to a boss, I gotta make it work
It's the see my niggas flossin', why we do the dirt
Bet a mili on the Dolphins and you know we lost
Run in the locker room like it was Set It Off
Dolphins 75% fuck all the politics
Better take us to the playoffs so I fuck your bitch
Shootin' dice with all my woes, we at the Superbowl
I'm like the title, I'm the one these niggas shootin' for
Obama let my niggas go, change all the crack laws
When movie come on boy, we rebuildin' the match box
On my knees at night, prayin' all my niggas safe
Ask God bless a nigga with a bigger safe
Blue cheese got it drippin' out the shoebox
Take off my shirt and show my abs like I'm 2Pac
I show my abs like I'm 2Pac
Take off my shirt and show my abs like I'm 2Pac

[Hook: Rick Ross]

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
Pulled up in Miami and told you niggas I'mma do it big
Hundred rooms, still addin' on to my crib
Everybody take a loss, I gotta make it work
I done see niggas have to tuck in they shirt
I got the (?) my nigga I'm bout to flip again
Hundred mil off shore accounts and start over again
I blow the dice, drop the diamonds, and just let 'em roll
Got her heart beatin' fast but we fuckin' slow
Crippin' every major city, keep it to yourself
(?) young nigga wealth
Get me a motor with no trannie, I'mma make it work
Watch me pull up in a Caddy baller alert
It's a cold game, it's why we pull the minks on
Black market so we gotta out the rings on
I'm on a different thing let these niggas sing more
The pinky ring, the diamond watch, the shit you (?) on

[Hook: Rick Ross]

Diamonds all on my hands, know I make it work
