[Intro: Wale]
Wale though
I said girl don't you talk too much
We 'bout to shine real soon, go

[Verse 1: Wale]
SHINE season and it's over
50k from the promoter
You the type of lady I'ma hold down
But for now I'ma need you to hold out
What's your name, I'ma call you tonight
Just know I'm callin' you never if I ain't callin' you mine
I'm tryna tend to your lows by makin' temperature rise
And t-t-t on the kitten, you never been with a lion
You fine, I just want you to shine
You'll be outta your mind once that anatomy mine
Then that'll be that, won't let you ever look back
For her I'll cut all my players, mess up my salary cap
Hey darling, go shawty
Can I modify your mind or your commas?
Let's go dancin', and maybe after
We can tag all the walls in Trump Plaza
She rebellious, hell yeah, she got a Brazilian
Said, "You done with the chickens?"
And all I told her was, "Hell yeah"
Hell yeah, that's all I'm eatin'
Now open your legs and let me woof up your Wall Street
McConaughey
Wale though

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
