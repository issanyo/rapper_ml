[Intro: Tyga]
This my shit
It's your shit, yeah

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby tell me if you're ready, ready for the real thing
You got 'em lined up and running block, but you need a real man
And if I get the chance I'mma ask you when's the last time you've been satisfied
Give me a chance, I'mma show you that I ain't even like them other guys
I'mma wait a bit, before I try to kiss it
I do it different than them others guys, I know they be tripping
I know what you want, so let's get right out of here
Let's go baby, I'm counting all my blessing tonight

[Hook: Chris Brown]
You saying all the right shit, well girl I like it
I'm gonna make this night romantic
I'm gonna love you baby
And I know what you've been dreaming about
Gonna take advantage of you, it's yo shit
Oh the way you put it on me
(It's your shit, it's yo shit)
Ooh baby, wanna take advantage of you
It's yo shit

[Verse 2: Tyga]
Sex on the dresser, legs on the leather
Do it so good, I might let you rub my necklace
We fucking to record just for the record
Nickname Alexis but you don't push a Lexus
V.I. no ordinary shit
Southern part of Euro, spending Euros at the camp
Checks waiting when I land, that's money in advanced
Benjamin talk frankly you don't understand me
My repertoire upper echelon
You should tag along, get your girls involved
What we doing here and speaking through your bras
Bra, fuck you hard
I'm a midnight star, David son of God
When you see the headlights like a falling star
Yacht no barge looking like DeBarge
Got a hater so blue like Marge

[Hook: Chris Brown]
You saying all the right shit, well girl I like it
I'm gonna make this night romantic
I'm gonna love you baby
And I know what you've been dreaming about
Gonna take advantage of you, it's yo shit
Oh the way you put it on me
(It's your shit, it's yo shit)
Ooh baby, wanna take advantage of you
It's yo shit

[Verse 3: Wale]
It's yo shit, it's yo shit, I dope dick her, leave her bow-legged
I'm dope yes I know this, the word is my third leg, a bowflex
Time to have sex, climb inside her 'gina as I'm in my stretch
I'm dipping in the 362 with the 57, soon as she get in it, she pull the flip on the zipper
I'm different with it, I can tickle your kidney with it
Miss me with trash, don't kick it with kitty litter
You seeing me with CB in the DMV of course
Hit the street, guarantee the women be abroad
Every blue moon, that's EBM for short
The bling and the ring look like Billie Jean Porsche
This that Mike Jack flow
I'mma bite that, spike that, you like now, ghost

[Hook: Chris Brown]
You saying all the right shit, well girl I like it
I'm gonna make this night romantic
I'm gonna love you baby
And I know what you've been dreaming about
Gonna take advantage of you, it's yo shit
Oh the way you put it on me
(It's your shit, it's yo shit)
Ooh baby, wanna take advantage of you
It's yo shit
