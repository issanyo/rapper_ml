[Intro: Wale]
So yeah like
I'm not really like worried about fucking up or you know what I'm sayin'
The plight of a rapper or whatever
Or the trials of tribulations
Cause you know, aside from me strugglin' or coming up in one of the most
Fucked up, hating ass areas in the world
I played football for twelve years you know
And anybody who plays sports, you know you got politics
And you got all the other bullshit
So I'mma talk about a little bit of that
And I'mma stop rappin' and start rappin' now
So drop the slam and let's get sick

[Verse 1: Wale]
Halfback toss to right
Yeah the coach used to say I was awesome, right
O.D. was in the weight room all his life
But I was more self concerned with the broads in life
On to college, Im always on the yard like farmers
Never in class
Dorm room hoppin' if workouts optional
Im not rockin'
I can run an option best in my conference
Look at my accomplishments, I'm all county
You double A niggas should be lucky y'all signed me
Lucky y'all found me, lucky y'all stole me
I could be with Bowden, I could be with Friedgen
Two a day curfews, where's my Freedom?
School ain't even start yet, there ain't not freaks here
Might as well prepare
Season opener, finna be there
When the depth chart came, there was no me there
I mean me is there, but it's like three there
Which made me have to wait like leap year
Cause I ain't really lift weights, I didn't need them
I run a 4.4, so they won't catch me there
Knocking on my coach door like a missionary
Playbook like a Oxford dictionary
Attitude that was not really felling
And he put me on ice, I was Oksana literally
I keep talking, I keep talking
My scholarship won't straight like Rodman
So Im walking
Fuck it, Im leaving
VSU next season
Peace

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I need you right now
I need you right now
You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya

[Verse 2: Wale]
They say, Trojans never break but it ain't that
For God sake, you can call coach Faison
I've seen dreams turn dust, cause he made them
Cause he played them, when he ain't played them
I've seen niggas loose cool, niggas leave school
And back to the block with nothing better to do
VSU don't regret you
Just regret the fact that I left too soon
I got kicked off, I used to shit talk
Excuse my complaint, but I got to get it off
Hey Mr. coach, I don't like you
You don't me, that don't mean I gotta move
You see the way I move, I am in another gear
You can ask Los, I was like a young Gale
My coach ain't care, so I ain't care
He ain't even respect the name, he said Whale
So I said yeah, and he was like yeah
You fumbled in a drill, young man get on the hill
So Im like fuck it, Im out get on your head
Such Karma, next year they 4-6
A few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit
And now I only listen to this hip-hop shit
A few niggas stay, a lot of niggas quit
Man fuck this shit

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I need you right now
I need you right now
You know how long I've been on ya
Since Prince was on Apollonia
Since O.J. had Isotoners
Don't act like I never told ya

[Verse 3: Wale]
I go, in when I start putting words out
Words sharp like a Jerry Rice curl route
Im moonshine, y'all merlot
I got on, and I gotta thank Marlon
Thank Kenny Burns, though we not talking
But my squad like the 72' Dolphins
Climate Shula, my flow Csonka
Im so Bonkas, Im not conscious
They are not confident when Im talking
Make them more insecure when they caught one
He tried tossing to Andre Johnson
Now Im getting compliments on how charming I am
And Im way out London, way out conscious
Y'all never seen
Exclusives, y'all never seen
They wait on my return, I am Vai Sikahema
Write it in my leisure, I rather go shopping
Gucci & Nike, thatâ€™s what I call an option
Um Tom Frazier, new LeBron haters
Got you niggas all over my bars just like Frasier
I've become immune to you no name haters
They can not pause like Ryu on Sega
I get inspired about your make up
You no good like a stripper with a "A" cup
Young Arrington, coming for you Aikman
Aye Jay, 8 grand skins gonna take that
Aye Bo, 10 stacks on the Patriots
Aye Rich, another 5 on the G Men
Another 5, Eli won't even be there
No Strahan, y'all need to rebuild
Back to you homo spittin so, so
You can't kick it like Romo hold for ya
No more for the broke I am more so
A first rounder, y'all don't want a Russell
I must go like fly route
My tires align with the play, but the times out
Yeah hail Mary full of grace
I swear these off rhyme bums are full of hate
Young Peyton don't huddle, still run my play
Still run that break, still get my ring, still run my shit
And it ain't no thing, you in Dungy's dungeon
So get that straight, yeah get that straight
Ain't nothing to Peyton
I am Marvin with mind, but I listen to Wayne
And I listen to 'Ye
Still listen to Big
And I listen to Jay
They are the coaches in this
And I listen to thought
And I listen to Common
We have nothing in Common
The shit that I spit is more
