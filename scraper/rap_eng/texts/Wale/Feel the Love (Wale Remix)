We got more dope?
Let's roll up then

[John Newman]
And, ohh, you know I said it's true
I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it, ohh ohh (Alright, boss)
I can feel it, ohh ohh (Uh, go, Work)

[Wale]
Yeah, straight drop in the verse with the dough-flow
Spent pounds to get kicks out in Tokyo
You a beach, I'm an ocean with the flow though
You can't see me, I'm a wave and a show boat
The gold bottles I probably got them from Mr Carter
I beg your pardon, I'm in the party- Balenciaga (Woo)
It's no sticks in the tree love
But the shit's so loud need ear plugs
Calm down lil' man, we don't fear thugs
I could probably pull your bitch with a pair o' Uggs
Slow flow, I suppose
I could pull any broad, eenie miney mo'
Ain't tryna' be the fullest but I gotta be the coolest
If I never tell ya bout it girl I'll let my bitches do it
Yeah I'm stuntin' like I'm posed' to, riding with a chauffeur
Niggas give me hate cause they bitches give me chocha

[John Newman]
You know I said it's true, you know I said
You know I said it's true, you know I said
You know I said it's true, I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it, ohhh
I can feel it, ohhh

You know I said it's true, I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it, ohhh
I can feel it, ohhh (no x30)

Mmm, I gotta tell you (tell you)
Tell you (tell you)

You know I said it's true (true, so true)
I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
Can you feel the love?
I can feel it, ohhhh

You know I said it's true, I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it, ohhh
I can feel it, ohhh

You know I said it's true, I can feel the love, can you feel it too?
I can feel it, ohhh
I can feel it, ohhh

I can feel it (too), I can feel it, I can feel it, can you feel it? (Too)
(Too), ohhh, ohhh

Too, too
Ohhh, ohhh
