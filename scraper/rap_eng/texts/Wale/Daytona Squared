My depiction of the second wind, thee
Clever thoughts of the effortless, when
I begin the journey through the industry, write
Every valium peak a nigga hype
Goadome Nike's the coldest of the storms I've endured
In fact I am bored with the warmth.
The cold-blooded stone face glance similar to Gargoyle all of the man
Talk how I am, but often the walk that I have
A flat-footed confidence stance
If hip-hop's Marshall, I'm all of it Stan
And they don't understand, a nigga stanzas like anthems
Such violence, dexterity in the air that I can land with the stand
A feline I feed lines cause they need mine
A tastemaker definitely freestyle so feel fine to critique mine
Yeah, its DC I'm used to diseased minds
Straight G leave freaks like peace signs
Legs open I stroke, then peace signs
Keep trying, and I don't really hear em'
You're nothing but a tadpole my lyrical aquarium is
Mad full, I cut niggas like I'm like a cap room
I draft niggas put a cap to em'
I slap niggas like mad women, or bad children
The black side of my hand attached to em'
I tattoo em' with my rap music
So much, they one-two em' when they hachooin'
I said my dunk game vicious, them bucks done came
I mastered SB's now I run these new J's
For the, second time I'm an OG nigga
Aim that 07' I am so nine sixin'
I spit engine, I'm lyrically a Piston
I'm playing my position like Billups nigga get some
Listen, they still politician while I ignore Bush like the Texans
Yup, My name Vic better known Wale
Hip Hop Joe I'm in the zone all day
My nigga Isai used to say Alize
And thats my big brother DC's DJ
Gotta hell of a squad
Go hard like Medusa on the knob
Shot out my nigga Booby up the farm
Groupies on the arm its hard not to love em'
A nigga carry hoes like luggage
Fuck it whole lot of flow for the fuck of it
They love it with my hair
