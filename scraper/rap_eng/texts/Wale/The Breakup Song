Intro
[Verse 1: Wale]
Yeah, see, breaking up is hard
To move along, it's even harder
It's over, she got colder, now
Can't locate where her heart is
And I'm just being honest
Since we not even talking
My mind won't let you go
Shit, even consider stalking now
You know I be teasing, though
You know that my ego won't
Thought this was forever love
Guess that was just seasonal
She got back with her old boy
She probably had a reason though
Although thought that we would grow
Guess that wasn't feasible
But we ain't gonna be beefing, no
I miss you at my recent show
I speak to CJ often and sometimes
I just want to speak you up
Yeah, hit you up
Or call you up, or send a text
Your new man got my respect
So if I do call it's just a check
Heard that you alright though
My nigga for life though
It's funny how this life go
We love for a while then a light goes
Took me a while just to write those
Pride, I had a fight so
I'mma stop right there and I know you don't care
But I hope you got that bite, boo, ay

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, tell me about the love of ours
"Contemplate", I wrote about her
We no longer close or nothing
That's why she ignore my flowers
And my call and my text
Spending her time with him I guess
I regret some shit I did
But darling, is y'all intimate?
Who was better? I know I was
Don't you lie, don't blow my buzz
You ask me who I'm stroking now
I say that the pool is closed
Can we stay broken up?
And all these pages, close them up
I hope we both do learn from this
So my next joint don't got to be so rough
Huh, got to get better with time
Relationships should never rewind
Better leave it all behind
Guess that means you can never be mine
Well, um, there's a but
Without your love it's cold as fuck
Life is a movie we both say "cut"
But most times darling the sequel sucks
