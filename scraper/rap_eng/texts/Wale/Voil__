[Chorus 1: Gucci Mane & Pharrell Williams]
Alright, come on let's go
They think I'm a magician (voilà, voilà)
They think I know magic (voilà, voilà)
They think I go abracadabra, leave me, come back 'cause I'm different (oh mama, voilà, voilà)
I might pull up in a Bentley (voilà, voilà)
Pull up in them Benzes (voilà, voilà)
I might pull up on a skateboard with me and P
Hoes gon' still pay me attention
(Ooh baby, voilà, voilà)
It's Gucci

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
You are a magician (voilà, voilà)
You can make it happen (voilà, voilà)
So, when you say abracadabra, leave me, come back as something different (voilà, voilà)
Pump it in your system (voilà, voilà)
Tell the muthafucka rattlin' (voilà, voilà)
And, and you bounce in your section just to show us that you're listening (voilà, voilà)

[Verse 1: Pharrell Williams]
Abracadabra (ay ay!), get out the bed
I'm your mirror, I'm the voice inside your head, ay!
Some motivation to get you up
You can lift your mood without it being touched, ay

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
You have the power to
Change the course of the night
Take this time to recharge (hold on, hold on)
Yourself up 'til the light goes off
Look around, we're your friends
We'll be here in every life
Every time you need a lift (hold on, hold on)
You'll know tricks, we'll pull it off

[Chorus 1: Gucci Mane & *Pharrell Williams*]
They think I'm a magician (*voilà, voilà*)
They think I know magic (*voilà, voilà*)
They think I go abracadabra, leave me, come back
'Cause I'm different (*oh mama, voilà, voilà*)
I might pull up in a Bentley (*voilà, voilà*)
Pull up in them Benzes (*voilà, voilà*)
I might pull up on a skateboard with me and P
Hoes gon' still pay me attention
(*Ooh baby, voilà, voilà*)
It's Gucci

[Chorus 2: Pharrell Williams]
You are a magician (voilà, voilà)
You can, You can make it happen (voilà, voilà)
So, when you say abracadabra, leave me, come back, it's  something different (voilà, voilà)
Purple in your system (voilà, voilà)
Tell the mama, fuck a rattlin' (voilà, voilà)
And you bounced in this section just to show us that you're listenin'

[Bridge: Pharrell Williams]
I know you ain't ready to go, so much to do
Somebody said you ready to go
And it's up to you

[Refrain: Pharrell Williams]
You have the power to
Change the course of the night
Take this time to recharge (hold on, hold on)
Yourself up 'til the lights go off
Look around, we're your friends
We'll be here in every life
Every time you need a lift (hold on, hold on)
You'll know the tricks, we'll pull it off

[Chorus: Gucci Mane & Pharrell Williams]
They think I'm a magician
Voilà, voilà
They think I know magic
Voilà, voilà
They think I go abracadabra, leave me, come back, 'cause I'm different
Diff-different
Diff-different
Different
Different

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, one time for my whole mob
One time for the whole squad
You told me you sold weight (Yeah)
You can't get your dope off (Yeah)
All I know is gold bar
That's my vibe (Yeah)
I should cover The Source, number 5 mics (Yeah)
Bitch, I came from nothing, gained it off the hustle (Yeah)
They say money talk, well can I pay you for a muzzle? (Yeah)
I don't mean to ruffle (Hey)
That's my vibe (Yeah)
You just smell like money (Hey), Chanel 5 (Five)
Yeah, hey, Different (Hey, yeah, hey)
Different (Hey, yeah, hey, yeah, hey)
Look
