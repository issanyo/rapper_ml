[Intro: Jerry Seinfeld]
Now one of the services you provide
Is giving them something to talk about
Let, let 'em talk
It makes 'em happy, it makes 'em feel good
They don't believe half the shit they say, people wanna talk
Yeah, it's fun to talk

[Verse 1]
Hate to be the bearer of, bad news
But I, can't move with too many rap dudes
I re-spect dudes from my double M crew
But I'm just not that dude hanging on to who's who's and such
Cash rule for some, got room for none
Can't fool with niggas who put the rumors up
Wanted to quit, rap music sucks
But couldn't run a 4.2 so with you I'm stuck
Went in the booth, truth, the only tool I trust
And that's sayin' a lot, cause Pro Tools be stuck
You grindin' hot, they wan' be cool with ya
They're like consignment shops, they old news to us, aye

[Pre-Hook]
Society, y'all trippin'
Uh, uh, aye what it look like?
I gotta be the realest
Aye, aye, aye what it look like?
Look, society, y'all trippin
Aye, aye, aye what it look like?
Should follow no nigga
Just the God inside of my mirror, nigga

[Hook]
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah (aye what it look like?)
Fuck you, leave me alone (aye what it look like?)
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah (aye what it look like?)
Fuck you, leave me alone
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
Fuck you, leave me alone
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah

[Verse 2]
Fightin' for my respect, receive it or nothin' else
Preachin' and geekin', I kinda think that I'm Malcolm X
MDMA in my juice, jaws tired and through
Now I'm sweatin' cause the bitches, they perspired me to
Are you judgin' me now? Do you fuck with me now?
Miscarried my first child, ain't finna come out
Fuck the therapy route, where the syrup and loud?
Blue 30 come around, there's the smile
Opiated, could show up later with more elation
All my bitches say, "Take it easy, enjoy the paper"
Try to be with the people, see what I'm fightin'
Them inner demons and how it was eatin' me while I be in Vegas
Yeah, life a gamble anyway, joe
Pop a Perc, I could merk through the pain though
Mind bills pilin' up, drop a single
Thrill's all gone when that mothafuckin' fame go
Ever seen a mixed J. Cole and Django?
Educated shit but he whip like he ain't though
Black bitches say my shit is so graceful
White bitches barely know me up in Greystone, damn!

[Pre-Hook]
Society, y'all trippin
Uh, aye, aye what it look like?
I gotta be the realest
Aye, aye, aye what it look like?
Society, y'all trippin
Aye, aye, aye what it look like?
Should follow no nigga
Just the God inside of my mirror, nigga

[Hook]
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
Fuck you, leave me alone
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
Fuck you, leave me alone
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
Fuck you, leave me alone
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah

[Interlude: Jerry Seinfeld]
Aware of everything
But paying attention to one thing
Me and my life

[Hook]
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
Fuck you, leave me alone
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
Fuck you, leave me alone
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
Fuck you, leave me alone
Fuck you, leave me alone, yeah
