(Izze The Producer)
Aye, have you ever met a nigga that can make anything happen?
I got star power, I got star power
I’m talking about making anything happen dumb ass nigga

[Hook: Young Dolph]
She do what I tell her
I got star power, star power
Smoked a blunt and got some head in the shower, whoa
Pulled me up  a four and called the bitch an uber driver, hello
I killed my Wraith with twenty fours, they say I’m suicidal
I might come turn up your trap , I got star power
I might get you wet then send your mama some flowers
I get paid by the pound, not paid by the hour
I got star power, I got star power

[Verse 1: Young Dolph]
New Ferrari came with 600 horse power
You not welcome in my trap house if you’re selling powder
That my favorite movie, but nah I can’t touch that blow
Never will I let my downfall be a ho
Fuck what you talking bout
I just gave my little bitch a pill
Call me Mr. Cosby
First name Bill

Celebrat it, crack a pint, pour up, nigga chill
