Imma make it rain
Straight shots don’t toast champagne
That K O D a lil bit of change
And these broads all know my name hold up
Imma make it rain
Straight shots don’t toast champagne
Magic city a lil bit of change
And these broads all know my name let’s get it crackin
One time D.C where the city at
If she give it to me now she gon give it back
Imma need to know now can a brotha crack
Or a brotha gotta role like a brotha act
I’m foolish shawty
I just wanna know we can do this shawty
Fly bomb on you and shawty
And I can be a ho to your two lips shawty
I'mma make it rain trick
This a lil change trick
Henny got me spinnin like a fuc*in hurricane kick
D C P G where I be
L O U D air I breathe
She like me from that no hands but I'mma need her to use no teeth
I dunno know you chick you dunno know me
Baby I'mma dog so the hoes all flea
Hot whips somethin cold on my feet
This is not somethin that I wrote for tha queens
You just do your thing chick
I'mma let you hang chick
She say she at magic city then im David Blane bit*h
