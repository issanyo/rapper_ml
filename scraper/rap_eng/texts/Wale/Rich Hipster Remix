[Wale]

She so ahead of the curb, peter get on the nerves
A thrift store for furs, and I’m hoping that miss knows her worth my loafer
She deserve of this thats and mores
Williamsburg with the riff raff of course, bills gonna fall behind
For the ills and the fashion forward
Ok, smile for the photo, cafe and tryina find a couple sohos
Approximately, my street, just watch me
The cops do, but cabs don’t I’m dark skin
Chris dior, mangella, Givenchy
Cool people in costumes how I see it
Greene sheet, I’m just playing some nas here
If I ruled the world better ghetto with non fear
The complex will cover Obama and Romney
And the only lucrative beef is to fucking rely on me

Spend a lot of money at the tattoo shop on weekends
Spend a lot of dividends on nb concert tickets
And I might just fly to Amsterdam, to hang with a friend of mine
Raybans shades hide the party I had at my spot last night
At 4:30 make it to Chrishan’s day I feel so fly
Oho, the coffee run I’m so tired
Starbucks please I’m so buy
Tryina change the world, die

I’m a rich hipster, I hang with 30000 fans, yeah
A really, really rich hipster, the richness lives in here
One to your heart

Home made t shirt, tattoo, converse, uniform
Yet not the norm
Home made t shirt, tattoos, converse, uniform
Look nice, yet not ignored
We all try to be different but we’re all alike
Sharing art and love we all bleed red tonight
When I hit the club, promise to show me love
No matter who you are, we all can get along
Meeting a new stranger, making new friend
Never know maybe a friend to the end
American delight and I’m back again
Wave your love when you wave your flag
I said wave your love when you wave your flag
Be Rich

I’m a rich hipster, I hang with 30000 fans, yeah
A really, really rich hipster, my richness lives in here

I’m a rich hipster, I hang with 30000 fans, yeah
A really, really rich hipster, my richness lives in here
I’m a rich hipster, I hang with 30000 fans, I do, aha
I’m a rich hipster, my richness lives in here
