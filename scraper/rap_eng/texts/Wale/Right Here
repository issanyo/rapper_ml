[Intro: Eric Bellinger & Wale]
Everything you want is right here (Right here)
Everything you need is right here, yeahhh
Everything you dreamed of is right here
I'm right here
I'm right here
Ey, let's get it though
Wale

[Verse 1: Wale]
Baba Folarin, with half the press and double the talent
What's a poet to rapper? It's a shark to a scallop
I'm the sharpest for sharpie talk, this indelible chatter
My true love is my daughter, the shorty's way after
Like way back there, not even same chapter
And I ain't Catholic, I hail Mary then blaze after
I'm a Lion they chasin', I think I'm Barry Sanders
But I'm very confident with no block I still carry better
Carry Hassadity bitches, I don't carry brothas
I carry niggas with no morals, so carry weapons
Go ask the industry who got intricate interviews
Put my phone off an evenin', I bet that Billboard be real confused
This is real influence boy, I'm the real boss
When they was in they cap and gown, I was in The Source
When they was graduatin', I was out in Glastonbury
Openin' hunnid thousand was advocating for that performance
That was Ronson, shout out to Rawson
Lenny Santiago, Rich Kleiman, and Mr. Carter
A combination of mental issues, liquor, and ganja
What a gift with these lyrics you hear Mr. Folarin

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger & Wale]
Everything you want is right here (Right here)
And I'm on if you want some
Everything you need is right here, yeahhh
Everywhere you need is an OnStar
Everything you dreamed of is right here
I'm right here

[Bridge: Wale]
Fuck wit me, look
Goodbye, yeah, for now, yeah, I'm found but I lost her
'Cause time is never right when you lost in nostalgia
Goodbye, yeah, for now, yeah, I'm found but I lost her
'Cause time is never right when you lost in nostalgia
And your nostalgia
So here's the thing, right
Okay, yeah, see

[Verse 2: Wale]
Got my city with this hip-hop
I'm truly infamous, you just did it to get clout
Boy, you headin' out wit' yo little spot
I shine different, my right wrist never tick-tock
Sprint, spread love, or nigga kick rocks
I swear fo' God, I'ma buy alot of 'em thick socks
Y'all lunchin', apply pressure, they start duckin' you
I am Debo, when I be leavin' they finna talk again
I'm black and I'm proud of it, The District Columbia
Been dissed by a dozen niggas it never been out of there
I really was out here, my shit was in madness
My shit was at all days on hope and with nausea
I'm local, I'm godsend, I'm global, you gossip
Too much on these blogs, hoggin' your mama good WiFi
Ain't no bullshit, at least upgrade it to 5G if you gon' be there all motherfuckin' week

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Everything you want is right here (Right here)
Everything you need is right here, yeahhh
Everything you dreamed of is right here
I'm right here
