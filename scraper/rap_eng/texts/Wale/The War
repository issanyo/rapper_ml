Look, I just want to make you better
I think I could save you
But I think I'm bipolar. I love you then I hate you
Grew with disdain though I hate whoever ain't you
Hate when I can't date you but I also need my space too
I made room for this love. How foolish of me
And every woman looking at you knew that you was lucky
So check the verse miss. I ain't say I'm perfect
But you was low on love, what I do; reimbursed it
And now it hurts to be around or converse with ya
And whatâ€™s worse is before this, I had worshiped you
Now war missiles hand guns and grenades
The walls I couldn't break em or take em apart with a tank
Now momma told me be careful who you love
G said just rap it up, these bitches actin up
And as for us, we was different though. Things have gotten difficult
Try to be Mr. perfect intercontinental, hold up
You spend your time with your friends all the time
And all that time with your friends put my momentum on decline
My minds gone evil. You changed with the season
You had a new clear heart. Guess I was Hiroshima

So now I need some Xanies, some Remy, and some reefer
So when this war is over I'm not PTSD'ing
And I don't wanna leave her. But you know what got me wonderin'
I'm scared to lose love but even more scared to love again

Why we gotta argue
Why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you, I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fightin' for
So tell me why are we at war

[Seinfield Skit]

Yea, they do whatever they want, whenever they want
And nobody else can stop it
I'm catching myself depositing these feelings she withdraw from
And I ain't got the gall to tell my godzilla byebye
So I'm hurting. Me effort is apparent she not fertile

The anger I've adopted. The feelings been aborted
So now I press ignore if ever Cupid tried to call up
They call me better now. See when everything is stopped
And your loves in hindsight and you see everything its not
Notice everything it wasn't. Realizing why it shouldn't ever be again
Cause in the end its not about what you put in
Fuck kissing and hugging. They love pushing your buttons
New love is so beautiful. Time just makes it ugly
But fuck it I accept it. no longer will neglect it
If a period is late then I will mark it with a question
That mean I never trust em. And if you ever love them
Know that favorite girlfriends turn into crazy baby mommas
The war

Now why we gotta argue. Why we gotta fight
I just wanna love you. I wanna make it right
It's like we both forgot what we were fighting for
So tell me why are we at war?

Just another product of this matrix
This maze I'm in amazes me at times
I just wanted to be at peace with you
And if I gotta settle for a piece of you
Then I gotta say peace to you
With all due respect I do respect you enough to expect
Effort is all I ask
If we gonna last more, I gotta ask for more
And if that means that I'm askin for too much
I'm sure we'll end up as our last or...past
We bash
We blast
We shoot
We lose
We pass.....war
