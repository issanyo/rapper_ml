[Intro]
Good afternoon, Washington, D.C
202, hit the 202
Maryland, 301
My name is Wale
But you probably know by now
I'd like to thank everybody for supporting the first mixtape
Prolly know me from the rap
Check out for that Capital Connection Vol. 2 coming out
And of course, Paint a Picture

[Verse 1]
In tune with the tune
Horn that wax like Q-tips do
The coolest dude this side of the Mason
Say I'm not him, y'all hallucinatin'
Far from a god, but my noggin is great
I am hard like Lavar and you all lookin' Aikman
And I'm not looking back
A brother in the zone like a corner in a flat
The Clinton Portis of the rap
Ignoring the reporters when they coming for the facts
I'm a hip-hip genius, show you where the G is
Going like Moss when they toss that screen in
And I ain't fearing' em, no I ain't hearin' them
And I don't even spit, man, a nigga Sean Taylor them
You Mike Pittman, don't do shit
Man, wipe your face off, take off to the gym, man
A different world like Sinbad
Simple ass nigga, sweatin' me like a gym bag
Jump back like chimpanzee
You're fucking with a Kong, I'mma off our beats
I wrestle with the hook and I brawl with the beat
So the song gonna bleed either way when I leave
Name Wale, don't say Walee
Don't really need a deal, I'm straight like crease
