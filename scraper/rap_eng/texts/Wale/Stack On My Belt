[Intro: Takbar]
Self-Made niggas man, you already know
I remember we use to watch the coke dry
Now a nigga crib gotta a boat dock
MMG navy nigga, high tide sellers
D.C. air-force, G-5s are better, you already know nigga
All gold sky-dwellers, fly nigga shit
Bel Air sippin', Ciroc pissin', foreign car dippin'
Young black millionaires nigga, we build the empires

[Hook: Rick Ross]
I spend a stack on my belt, I swear you niggas are watching
I gave a stack to my bitch, she the shit out the project
Spend a stack on my belt, therefore you bitches are stalking
A half a mill on the car, that's why you niggas are talking
Spend a stack on my belt, as if you think I was flogging
Spend a stack on my belt, and you could still see my boxers
Spend a stack on my belt, that how I blew your deposits
Stack on the belt, double M this shit popping

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Spend a stack on my belt, got bitches asking my name
Spend a stack on the belt, she like fuck how we came?
Double R in the front, ya'll niggas stay in your lane
Spend a stack on my belt, don't even ask 'bout the change
Spend a stack on the belt, cause I knew she a wife
Spend a stack on the belt, cause my fooleys on time
Spend a stack on the belt, I got your bitch on my mind
The world is mine

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Spend a stack on my belt, better tell these rappers to chill
Hold up that's Hermes, more H and I be more trap, that's for real
And I got mosquino
Ye ain't  know that R.I.P. flow? Here it go
That type of freak show with three shones
Then we don't need no more help
That Givenchy go for three, just me Rozay and the clique
I make these bitches suck on Cs
You make them suck on there teeth, let's get it
Ralph, cloudin', we out, they bounce
We hit, ad-lib, your bitch, her mouth
Stack on the belt, just know that's nothing to me
My soldiers real in the 'ville, you WWE
Of course we see them, punks faking
But we leave them, slumped, shaking
Don't believe your Kane stories, I should leave ya'll undertaking
A stack on my belt, 250 my ride
Went from renting these motherfuckers to owning 4 with no miles
I pray my souls is intact, passion in the bulk of my rhyme
And when I hit that heat game I'm this close to LeBron
I'm gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Whole Slab]
I'm burning the back, I'm swerving Maybach
I Versace'd my belt, I done Hermes my flag
Got a stack around my waist, keep my bitch on the leash
She gon' eat this head up, on this dick she gon' feast
Time fuck with the pleats, my place is packed
Red hoes in my stable, yeah my babies is bad
She spent a stack on my belt, now she calling me father
Stingray Balenciagas, giving mollies to models
I manage these strippers, Giuseppe's with zippers
Playing with the whole slab, niggas started with niggas
Rose gold on my wrist, rose gold on my shades
Spend a stack on my belt, 100 done on my face

[Verse 4: Birdman]
Spend a stack on my belt, so I could stunt when I shine
Get the mac off the shelf, keep these pussies in line
Spend a stack on my belt, 10 at the bar
Blow a mill on a whip serving niggas that raw
Spend a stack on the belt, Versace my kind
Put 5 on his life, put 5 in his mind
Spend a stack on the belt, bitch we them real niggas
Plaques on the wall, born to kill niggas - BLAAAT~!

[Outro: Sam Sneak]
Stack on that belt, ho {M-M-M}
Stack on that belt, ho {M-M}
Spend a stack on the belt, ho
Gotta stack for the freak show
On her knees and she open like a (dyke!)

[Outro 2: Birdman]
Double M, YMCMB boy - BLAAAT~! {Maybach Music}
