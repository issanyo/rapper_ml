From a life of set backs to a jack pot
I spent my life in them flats
Tryin' to extract

I spent nights in the truck tryin' to get that
And like the boy adapts, no regrets from
My reflection in the mirror
Is my perception of a winner
My redemption to begin a resurrection of the sinner
Of walking through the corridor, troubled force
I'm married to my problems I should well divorce
I'm talking to my conscience like I wanted more
And I can't ignore the fact that I'm well informed
But I can't afford to slack or be comfortable
To be the best on every track is what I'm running for
If I believe that I can, then I must for sure
And make something out of nothing being bloody poor
I'm unstoppable, and on top of all
Had to made through the rain and a thunderstorm
I've been training for this day since I learned to walk
And I should pick myself up, if I'm traded for

I'm breaking out
I'm running
I'd win the fight
Got me running, running for the crown
And I roc here roc for life
Aim for the skies
Wanna make you mine
So running, running for the crown
And I roc here roc for life

Wale:
Concrete, throws me only consciously
But most of 'em just talking we'll be bouncing on your...
This is all C, MMC lota Cs
Black billionaires, neither one my nigga got the greeds
Mister caught up or Mister Robinson know my position
Probably cause this for...
I can pick up the parties
And I went to college my partners was fiscal problems
Dropped out and now I'm getting dollars like at God damn Harvard
And it tells you I will make it, now forever Wowerful
But you niggas couldn't play the foe, or the five
Yeah, roc boys still running side

I'm breaking out
I'm running
I'd win the fight
Got me running, running for the crown
And I roc here roc for life
Aim for the skies
Wanna make you mine
So running, running for the crown
And I roc here roc for life
