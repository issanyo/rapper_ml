[Intro: Wale]
K.B. what up? Jonas what up? Haha. Check it. Uh

[Hook: Wale]
And it weighs a ton
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun
And I master every trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue, nigga
And it weighs a ton
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun
And I master every trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade
Ha, uh

[Verse 1: Wale]
There's nothin' like where I come from
That's why I shed light on the dark I come form
Nigeria inspired the talk drum
The sole proprietor of the globe from our sun
I own it
Now everybody on it
My mind's so bright when that when I go in you can't notice it no mo'
So if I talk down to a man
Not only do I enlighten but I provide a tan
Hoppin' out a van
Braggin' because I am
Draped in green and red like flag of Sudan
While you pretendin, you niggas so pretentious
I love a Tracey Ross but I don't keep a girlfriend, look
Warm is a pen from the hand from the head
That whatever it creates it will land in the head
Of the pack of the group
They lack what I do
You would think that I had a match for a tooth
And I snap like Bob Backlund in the booth
To bad bitches I'm about as bashful as Luke
I freak nicks into Swishers
Two dyke bitches while I'm filmin' them picnic, yum
The District's son
Prodigal, the Prodigy
That's Mobb Deep and that is no pun,Do
Straight bad bitches I run, through
I pull out when I'm cummin'
I love to be redundant
So I'm hopin' that your period is punc-tual
On time
One rhyme
Wale Folarin huh
Holler at me

[Hook: Wale]
And it weighs a ton
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun
And I master every trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue, nigga
And it weighs a ton
Dub A.L.E., Still a son of a gun
And I master every trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade
Ha

[Verse 2: Torae]
The bars razor blade sharp and no
Cold, Antarctic flow, rap nigga, you ought to know
See my name on a flier then you ought to go
My arsenal, makes for an awesome show
And the discography, somethin' you got to see
It's like I snatched names off of classic LP's
I guess I sort of did and I call it Daily
Conversation, abbreviation I made it D.C
The home of Wale, formerly home of me
I did a little stint, shout out to the south east
And slid back north of course to pen more
Awesome thoughts, record and forward to y'all
Underrated so I over charge
Bars is over y'all
They hot now, when Tor' drop it's over for 'em
I'm light years ahead of you right tiers
So the homie Wale can leave the hook right
Jeah

[Hook: Wale]
I'm a son of a gun
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun
And I master every trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue, nigga

[Hook 2: Kingpin Slim]
And it weighs a ton
My name's Kingpin Slim and I'mma son of a gun
And I master every trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade
Ha

[Verse 3: Kingpin Slim]
I'm important to the impostors
Boppers
Impressed with my pimp posture
Team shine hard, you'll squint at the roster
Fuck around you gon' need a stint at the doctors
Clown be careful
Fuck boys you should be fearful
We tote toast like we cheerful
Cheers
I flash smiles at the mean looks
Got a little too much confidence to seem shook
Use my watch as a pawn to get your queen took
I got a fetish for fresh, I'm a clean crook
And I don't need a coupon when I cop a Coupe
Cause I'm a baller all y'all niggas do is block the hoop
You're sayin' that's your girl
She's a prostitute
I treat her neck like a net when I stop and shoot
Swish
Even if I miss she gon' rebound
Homie, got the industry watchin' DMV now
I know they gon' see me unless they senile
I pray I stay up out the grave and the penile
Meanwhile
I'm convertible coastin'
I ainâ€™t playin' no more, I converted to coachin'
And I rarely get credit so I keep cash with me
Cocaine is a hell of drug, ask Whitney
Yeah, this is creativity on Creatine
D.C. about to blow, we know cause we the guillotine

[Hook: Wale]
I'm a son of gun
Dub A.L.E., such a son of a gun
And I master every trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade under the tongue, nigga
And it weighs a ton
Dub A.L.E., still a son of a gun
And I master every trade under the sun
Talk sharp like a razor blade
Ha
