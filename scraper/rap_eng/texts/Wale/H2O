Upper body, might work for that
But you ain't a model where your focus at
Know too many broads, going way too hard
So have a glass of water for your thirsty ass
Like that, your thirsty ass
Know it's a problem and we notice that
You be goin' too hard and never know when to stop
Have a glass of water for your thirsty ass
Like that, your thirsty ass
Know it's a problem and we notice that
You be goin' too hard and never know when to stop
Have a glass of water for your thirsty ass
Like that

[Verse 1]
She got Instagram, niggas in town prolly been through that
So the niggas from outta get the pics from out her
Niggas clickin' they mouses she give a clip in them
It's like that, broad thick as shit
On the real though I'd prolly do some shit to it
But every nigga I follow prolly been through it
For every dirty dog there lies a thirsty bitch
It's like that, and I ain't perfect miss
But to be modest, I ain't worth a bit
Got a son with no father, ain't got no one to watch her
Only care 'bout the comments sittin' under the pic
It's like that, such a narcissist
They don't acknowledge 'til she blog her tits
Can't get any more out her even that equip
But still make it a problem when I ask to hit
It's like that

[Hook]
Can't' work for it, cause you ain't a model
Where your focus at?
I know too many broads that be going too hard
So have a glass of water for your thirsty ass
It's like that
Know it's a problem and we notice that
You be going too hard and never know when to stop
So have a glass of water for your thirsty ass
It's like that...
So have a glass of water for your thirsty ass
It's like that...
Glass of water for your thirsty ass
It's like that...


[Verse 2]
He on Instagram, followin' broads that never follow him
Take a pic of the watch, it might get him some box
But what she won't find out, it don't belong to him
It's like that, with all his kicks
In the club with some bottles and like all his pics
We applaud it yeah, you a boss for real
But it's easy to cop livin' out mama's crib
It's like that, on a search for it
Prolly show you his closet, never show you a crib
Yeah the thirst is real, get to twitter and get on every girl in it
It's like that, type of nigga is you?
I'm the type that ain't trippin' cuz I be gettin' the loot
Like I'm already groomed, when I come to the room
Talkin' yellow and bare, my nigga Winnie the wooh!
Tryna build me a pool, tryna get me a chick
Tryna see what to do, tryna kick it a bit
Tryna take it in steps before you gon' think I know your man
Baby have you a sip, it's like that
