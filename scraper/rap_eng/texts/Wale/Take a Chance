[Intro: Wale]
A couple of things
This is as honest as I could be
My sole objective is
To love, listen, and respect her

From this very second
I’m just saying
That she’s special enough for me
To want to protect you against you
Don’t love me, shawty

[Verse 1: Monica]
I’m sure you did a lot of things
Before I got in the picture
Didn’t you?
Wait, don’t tell me

I know you kissed a lot of girls
Told a lot of lies
Booked a few hearts
But listen
I ain’t feel none of that
Last night when you held me

I just wanna believe that you
Met a girl who felt something different
I believe that girl met you
And saw someone
Who had some beautiful intentions

[Chorus:]
So let’s just take a chance
Take a hand
Take a leap
And do what most won’t underštand

(Let’s just take a chance)
Who knows where we’ll end
I’ll be down
If you tell me
You can’t
I’ll learn to change my plans
I’m willing to take that chance
(Just take a chance)

[Verse 2: Wale]
Uh, settle down, queen
No one better's you forever
This for now, queen
When the time’s right
Get your mind right
We will tell our whole town this is our thing

But for now, queen
This is how it'll be
I could fully understand if you gotta leave
When the time’s right
Get my mind right
I’mma get these bummy bitches from around me

Got a past I’m ashamed of
Past full of danger
I can give you everything
But a last name is sacred
All I ask is a chance that you take
And be safe with yourself
And never lack any patience

I’m a young wild bull who been through a lot
Use them fucking groupie bitches
To conceal my heart
I could stop
I take them down
But I take you out
It’s funny how you got the ring
And they always give up the box

[Chorus:]
So let’s just take a chance
Take a hand, take a leap
And do what most won’t understand
(Let’s just take a chance)
Who knows where we’ll end
I’ll be down if you tell me you can’t
I’m willing to change my plans

[Bridge:]
I’mma pay attention
To the obvious
So there’s no need
For you to mention your past
I’m ready

[Chorus:]
So let’s just take a chance
Take a hand
Take a leap
And do what most won’t understand

(Let’s just take a chance)
Who knows where we’ll end
I’ll be down
If you tell me you can’t
I’m willing to change my plans
I’m willing to take that chance
So let’s take a chance
