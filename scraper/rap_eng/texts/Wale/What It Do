I done already came down
So this time I gotta come through
Chucking deuces out the window
Getting to the money and I’m howling

What it do, what it do, what it do now
What it do, what it do, what it do now
What it do, what it do, what it do now
What it do, what it do, what it do now

Swang a man, nigga hold a man
Can’t control a man, can’t fall a man
All the bad hoes on the road with me
Oh, shit, got so more hoes, got Hennessey
Problem at the scene, I don’t even smoke
But let’s roll a swish
I’m rolling on choppers
And we ain’t worried about them boppers
Hell, not me, not with my niggas
And I’m just tryina see the whole world with my niggas
I got this piece of chain, I got this diamond ring
Man, I bought everything, I got it, you can’t say the same
I keep it chill, man, ‘cause I’m living comfortable
I’m 23 and it ain’t a bitch I ain’t done before

I done already came down
So this time I gotta come through
Chucking deuces out the window
Getting to the money and I’m howling

What it do, what it do, what it do now
What it do, what it do, what it do now
What it do, what it do, what it do now
What it do, what it do, what it do now

Close your eyes up and open your mind up
See, niggas where I’m from let the money, vagina
Most is gone before they 24
And every summer know them guns go
I know I’m blessed because I’ve seen the rest
I’ve seen a fiend who was a queen before the D and jet
And we is black, we supposed to be B Jacks
And the hope just get show down as you hope, can’t get no school
So they shoot niggas out the class but it’s summer
That give us hope, sniper Jones and tile of, I can name a few
Say I’m young and James white, my nigga, what it do
So I’m the only one to do it without throwing hoops
Get a real bill out the vocal booth
Had a meal ticket, select a few, I do think my respect is due
If I get a brow back I’mma give it right back
They laugh, they let my niggas through
Bet they let my niggas through
H Town, nigga, what it do

I done already came down
So this time I gotta come through
Chucking deuces out the window
Getting to the money and I’m howling

What it do, what it do, what it do now
What it do, what it do, what it do now
What it do, what it do, what it do now
What it do, what it do, what it do now
