[Kramer] I told you
[Jerry] What?
[Kramer] I told you she liked me
[Jerry] How do you know
[Kramer] She told me
She said she's never had a man
Stir up all these feelings inside of her
She's questioning her faith!
She's thinking of leaving the church!
[Jerry] Wow...
[Kramer] Rrrrgh, this sick power!

[Avery Storm]
I got two whole tears in a bucket
And if our plans fall through then fuck it, nah
Way too much right here is at stake
I am invincible, yeah
(The power, the power, the power)
I am unstoppable, yeah
(The power, power, power, power
Power, never will I ever utter, yeah, look)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh

[Wale]
Straight renegade, penetrating minds
Taking my time, let me levitate
Y'all can't ever fade that, I don't ever lack shit
I ain't ever ask for nothing to make it right here
Y'all all passe, stuck up on last year
I'm everybody top ten, you ain't even top tier
My criteria ain't even that serious
The way a nigga see it you little niggas is curious
Yeah, I got Philippe Chow flow
See I slept, now at least y'all know
I live by the code: fuck bitches, love queen
So you don't got to wonder what I got up on my team
Got a pocket full of cream, my moccasin's clean
I'm playing for the green, shorty I'm Mateen Cleaves
I'm a team player, I ain't tryna be no king
Just trying to be a legend for a nigga hit 3-0
The board CEO, I'm glad you all
Witnessing what I did for D.C. though
They disregard me, I guess they all got egos
They all need attention, they call me a G though
The Roc to Allido, they all believe me though
And even with that, I be the rap Don Cheadle
It's Hotel Rwanda, boast got cause I got to
Spit that raw shit, y'all some talkative condoms, fall back

[Avery Storm]
I got two whole tears in a bucket
If our plans fall through then fuck it, nah
Way to much right here is at stake
I am invincible, yeah
(The power, the power, the power, the power
The power, the power, the power, now what?)
I am unstoppable, yeah
(The power, the power, the power, the power
The power, the power, deuce, uh)
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh

[Wale]
Who woulda thought that the little runningback
With the Dickerson mask would be getting in the ass
Of opponents, witness what I'm showing
And I don't need no center or guard to get him open
Hold up, I used to run powers and draws
Now I'm tricking with the strippers, the power of the drawers
And I don't run counters no more
But I took a fly route to an opposite shore
A real life viking, shout out to St. Paul
Foamposite Max like I'm out of Wake Forest
That's Duncan for slow-mo's, mine be so OG
That they probably be in the closet of old folks
All Prada, flow is all water
And I am ahead of my time like false starters
Rap harder, rap smarter, I'm well-rounded
And you are not around like black fathers
The black Favre, black man and black breeze
My weed and my broad exotic with no seeds
And I am in the heart of every broad who approach me
That's why I get cut like I don't fuck with the coach knees
A cold beast, nigga I'm the shit
I ain't Ye, I ain't Hov, I ain't Wayne, I ain't Tip
I am Olubowale, the answer to this
In these new Lebron VIIIs, you are just a witness

[Avery Storm]
I got two whole tears in a bucket
And if our plans fall through then fuck it, nah
Way to much right here is at stake
I am invincible, yeah
I am unstoppable, yeah
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oh
