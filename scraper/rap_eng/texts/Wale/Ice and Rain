Chorus:
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, falling in love

Verse 1:
She was so stuck, a fool in love with the wrong thing
And then along came the wrong man for her
The former, position of a pimp
He ain't have em on a track, he just had em like that
An uptown cat, Kennedy where he be at
She wasn't hip to the niggas were he be at
And she was from the burbs
And not the black burbs, I mean the white burbs
But that's why he liked her
Fascinated her, discriminated school boy
See, she would complained of the tested nature
Oh how she love the gangstas, they love them green ones
They love misleading them having there beliefs fucked
Since she wasn't really cribbing to his living
Soon as para finite will paralyze her existence
She was persistent on love though omit it
Waited on its arrival but baby but never get it

Chorus:
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, searching for love
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, falling in love

Verse 2:
Yeah months in every night she's in tears
She tried to call home mom dukes ain't care
She like, girl you wrong running away from home
So I guess you think you grown
So go on girl get on
She fiend for attentions
While his fiends for cream well exceeded the dream she once lived for
Oh its over whole time she knows this
Homie will never love her, although he'll probably have a fit
If his bitch insist on getting sick
And tired of his shit and tries to just split
So she just sit while settling for the lesser
A breakdown broad oh she could of done better
A cocaine measurer, part time lover
A full time sex slave, never find another
Couple months under him something in the oven
She says I got news, he denies that young'n

Chorus:
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, searching for love
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, falling in love again

Verse 3:
As she goes through the levels
She feels a baby is the way to save her relationship that ain't nothing
But it ain't change nothing, he getting worser
And she getting bigger so she feeling like she cursed
Time to get her bags get ghost
Hoping that mama would sympathize cause she broke
So she finally gets the courage to tell him on his arrival
Waiting holding her stomach but holmes would never find out
The door crack, niggas all black
Kicked down the door the looking for the cash
They took her by the throat, we front in here for dope
We don't with the jokes girl, where the fuck the notes at
We called your man he knew just what it is
We told him no dough then we go and get your bitch
The nerve of this prick, he said fuck it you can have her
We calling his bluff, so get your nose on this handgun
She just laughs as her life starts flashing back
And there's little to be glad for
I've been living in hell so death can never fade me
Bullets penetrate me, but they can never faze me
I can never face me again, cause I hate me
So tell him I been dead he killed me when he made me
He killed me when he made me, tell him I been dead POW!

Chorus:
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, searching for love
Ice melts into rain
Love turns into pain
Here I go again, falling in love again
