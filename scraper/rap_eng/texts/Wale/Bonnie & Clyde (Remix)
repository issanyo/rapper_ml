[Verse 1: Mack Wilds]
Ooh, who knew you’d try to do me like you do?
Frontin’ hard, like fuckin' me ain’t cheating…
Baby, shame on you
It ain’t like we been doing different thangs…
'Cause you were mine before you two began…
Past times of loving you
Liquor, sweat, and touching
To breakups, makeups, and kissing every inch of you
And I, I, I, I
I took a backseat on
Love after you
I mean, i cried after you
Part of me died after you
But here we are, doing the same thangs…
To him, that broke us into two
So I
Feel the vibe…
Look in yo eyes
Put pride aside
Pull yo panties to the side
'Cause I
Wanna, have you for the night…
Hope that he don’t mind

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
When you want it…
Then I got it…
It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay…
When you want it…
Then I got it…
It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay…

[Verse 2: Mack Wilds]
Ooh, who knew you’d do me baby, like you do?
We, running wild, while he at home, calling phones…
All for you
Oh, I swear to god
If he was me, why would I trust you?
Knowing his calls still get through?
Addicted to the love of memories…
And fulfilling all your fantasies
I
Close your eyes…
Kiss once or twice…
Then hit it right
And I know shit just isn’t right
But I
Need, to feel you for tonight…
Bonnie and Clyde, down for life

[Chorus: Mack Wilds]
When you want it…
Then I got it…
It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay…
When you want it…
Then I got it…
It’s okay, it’s okay, it’s okay…

[Verse 3: Wale]
Real quick, Bonnie, Bonnie…
I follow your guidance ever so precisely
I give you my best
And respectfully let you
Ingest what left of me
If you would just get right with me
Rightfully
Whole soul, mind, body, beside me on the nightly
And the, depth of my introspect is like the injection of
Several knives
You see, I’m twice as deep
Console mode, and ride with me
Don’t fight with me
Goodnight 'til next time…
Peace

[Vamp: Mack Wilds]
Who knew we’d be this way?
Our love would be this way?
We doing wrong, know we wrong
But we can’t escape
So we chase the days away
Hoping night’ll stay
I got you
You got him
But this don’t fade away… hey
No drug is better than forbidden love…
We s’posed to cherish your commitment, love…
Put on a show when he’s around
But when I’m in your town
Just know it’s going down
Hit my numbers baby
