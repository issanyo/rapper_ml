[Intro (?uestlove & Chrisette Michele)]
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing the same song all day long

[Verse 1 - Black Thought]
So get your glass lift it up in the toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused wit it we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad we so committed
We not the kids cooling out on the sofa with it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta nigga

[Verse 2 - Wale]
Hip-Hop ain't dead cuz the pulse is in us
I got the Everclear flow, they mimosa with it
We are the hope of the culture, they supposed to listen
And I'm supposed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league, I'm Oden with it
Yet don't owe them niggas nothing but potent lyrics
But if you ain't got the dance they revoke your spinning
So good rappers ain't eating they Olsen twining
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar
With the counterfeit hitters they so-so with it, but they are Sosa with it
They Mark McGuire with the written, I'm Rodriguez
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hitting
This is the trial and error era no co-defendant
I push The Seed every time like I'm Cody with it
I said the one-hit wonders pneumonia to us
I don't know you niggas, hit the road my nigga
