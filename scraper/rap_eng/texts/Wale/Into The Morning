Every day we hit the club, and party hard
All on the furniture with no regards

I'm faded, bring me three more bottles
Tryin' to hit the room with this bad lil' model
Every day we party hard, like there ain't no 'morrow
We gonna take this party on into the mornin'

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday (Into the morning)
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Friday, Saturday, Sunday (Into the morning)

I'm faded, bring me three more bottles
Tryin' to hit the room with this bad lil' model
Every day we party hard, like there ain't no 'morrow
We gonna take this party on into the mornin'

Turn it up like every day
Only question which club Imma hit today
Might flex up and get bit today
Make it rain and pay somebody's rent today

Haters don't know what to say
Club feel like the first of the month today
Free shots for the girls in the front today
Hit the pussy, hit the blunt more than once a day

Miami going hammy
Standing on the furniture
We in the reckless mind state
Don't act like you ain't heard of us

We shut this city down
You gonna know when we around you
Where? where a group of bitches when a fist
When I test this ticket, wet I made her you can drown in there

Man it's fine I'll be good in the morning
Got some women who are down to performing
Got a camera with a light that's recording
I knock 'em out, knock 'em out, George Foreman

Yeah, two times on a Sunday
What a lil' brother got to 'em goin' one way
When the night falls, get sun in your life
Feels like one big party all in one day

Every day we hit the club, and party hard
All on the furniture with no regards

I'm faded, bring me three more bottles
Tryin' to hit the room with this bad lil' model
Every day we party hard, like there ain't no 'morrow
We gonna take this party on into the mornin'

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday

Wale DC said we aren't  yo
And I'm out here accept with a lil' help
With a couple me and Jones all on
Gone race all mornin' shawty need a poncho

And that's all the time
Call  you anything but I can't call you mine
'Cause I'd be lyin'
Y'all be fine, chase bread with my dog motherfucker feline

Let's hit the floor
Came with one but I get with four
Lick the sto, let's just smoke
She ain't really sick of this but she let me blow

That's Roscoe flow
Ran to the birds, yo, Flacko ho
Best round here 'case y'all don't know
When I'm done getting' brain then I honor roll

Then I'm off in the morning
I don't know these hoes
I'm just in love recording this, Oh shit back up porn fly shit
Size 9 fly kicks, my body dimes, ill sweater Bill Cosby

Every day we hit the club, and party hard
All on the furniture with no regards

I'm faded, bring me three more bottles
Tryin' to hit the room with this bad lil' model
Every day we party hard, like there ain't no 'morrow
We gonna take this party on into the mornin'

We gonna take this party on into the mornin' let's go
