I'm a young man tryna make her move

I stay winning, winning, winning, winning
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning
I stay winning, winning, winning, winning

Spend money silly, fur coat when I'm chilly

With a check like Cassie I'm gettin' my ops angry
Straight from the A from the dirty south

Chrome nigga FUCK what you heard about
We was chillin', winnin', livin' at my family PROUD
