[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Shorty bad as my son is, pretty face and no stomach
Was the city's most wanted 'til I said gimme yo number
Youngest n*gga I'm stuntin', no more Civics from Honda
Money comin' in bundles, that's the reason she wanna
(Lay up, lay up, lay up, lay up)
I keep a vest on my chest, to cover my heart
I'd rather f*ck in the light, 'fore I make love in the dark
Cuz she was f*ckin' me right, it felt like love from the start
Was gettin' money on tour, so we was lovin' for fall
But first we go together then break up, tears drip on her makeup
F*ck all night 'til we wake up, and like George Gervin we lay up
Cuz all them lies I made up, it's big checks no pay cut
Floor seats in Florida, Heat game vs Lakers
Shorty on my team now, it was us versus them haters
And everybody they talk bad, when they talk that she take up
She Hermes all flavor (?), young boy get paper
And all I know is go hard, and every time I touch that ball I go swish

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She know it's game time when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don't miss (don't miss), I don't miss (don't miss)
I don't miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Sittin' back with this paper fallin' in my lap
Feelin' isolated nothin' but them hundred stacks
When your money up tell me who you're supposed to trust
Every night a different woman, f*ck your money up
My bank account in shape, I could run with Puff
I came to put you down shorty so what the f*ck is up
Since I met her she can't keep that pussy off me
On the pill, I'ma kill that pussy softly
Back to back time to show you how a gangster move
Keys to the pad, talkin' infinity pools
V12's ain't a thang, time to change your name
Paper stuffed in her purse can't hear her phone ring

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She know it's game time when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don't miss (don't miss), I don't miss (don't miss)
I don't miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

[Verse 3: Wale]
Homie picture me rollin', all them b*tches be on me
They be fishin' for compliments, I'm just fishin' off Boca
Made a grip off them vocals, got a gift with the vocals
So much over these hoes should have been on a poster
Infatuated to say the least
He lay it weak, I lay you once, you lay a week
Wale a freak, he know it doe, no go with hoes
When it come to showin', I am working with totem pole
That's head on head, she give me head, I give her glow
I'm in her body, I'm in her head like quote unquote
The coldest flow, the flyest combination was voila
Au revoir to my rivals, double M genius shotta

[Hook: Trey Songz]
She know it's game time when I do it like that
When I pass it to her baby throw it right back
She can get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right
And when I shoot I don't miss (don't miss), I don't miss (don't miss)
I don't miss when I do it now
She could get the lay up, all night
She be tryna lay up, all right

[Verse 4: Trey Songz]
From the night to the morn', yeah she tryna lay
Got a freaky, freaky game and she tryna play
Couple more shots baby can you make it stay, stay up
Lay up, lay up
Might just slap the backboard, give you what you ask for
Lay up, lay up
