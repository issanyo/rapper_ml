[Hook: Rihanna]
Come here rude boy, boy
Can you get it up
Come here rude boy, boy
Is you big enough
Take it, take it
Baby, baby
Take it, take it
Love me, love me
(repeat)

[Verse 1: Wale]
I swear Ri got a hit with this
So I gotta spit to this
And we gon' hit that ganja
'Til our lips lookin' licorice
This is Roc Nation and I'm not patient
So if it's not a problem can I (take it take it)
(Come here rude boy) Guarantee I'm big enough
Promise if you hold me down
Then you get to live it up
Car with no limit what
Cop what you pickin' up
Stop it if you scared
Only chicken heads chicken out
I'm chicken stripping off your lil blouse
Flower bomb detonator IV tech in route
Pop it back stick it out
Show me that it's alright
I be on my dark liquor
She prefer the dutty wine
Yeah, and I don't dance I just two step
I'm a rare rat that be hunted by the super cat
Baby all I do is rap
(?) (?) louis bag
Holla at your rude boy
I know what you do with that

[Hook: Rihanna]
Come here rude boy, boy
Can you get it up
Come here rude boy, boy
Is you big enough
Take it, take it
Baby, baby
Take it, take it
Love me, love me
