[Verse 1: Wale]
They ain't talking to us, uh
This thing is easy like a layup
Meeting at the top and ain't no people in the way of
Me and my squad, this is visual art
I just paint a few bars
Leave the frame up for Amadeus

[Verse 2: Stalley]
Yeah 'Le, this is easy like a layup
Been overtime with the grind, yeah I got my weight up
Busting through these lines like T-Suggs, time to pay up
Raven flow, sky high, yeah I'm talking way up

[Verse 3: Wale]
Hold up, say what? say what?
What's wrong with all these haters?
They lyin', they lyin'
Ndamukong I'm saying
I'm tryna put my partners on, we always gon' be first
A team of all-stars like there's diamonds on my T-shirt

[Verse 4: Stalley]
Look at all these haters' faces
Boy are they hurt
We're winning, everything earned
Nothing given to us
Repeat champions, wanna win, then you gotta go through us
Non-debatable so don't talk to us
Undefeated in bouts, so we don't talk losers

[Wale]
We talking true lyrics, boy, talk to us
Woo!
First Take, every word great
That record produce verbs, check out that wordplay!

[Outro: Wale]
First Take, every word great

[Stalley]
Non-debatable so don't talk to us

[Wale]
A team of all-stars like there's diamonds on my T-shirt

[Stalley]
Undefeated in bouts

[Wale]
Checkout that wordplay!
