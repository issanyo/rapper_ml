Okay, Valentino, Valentino

[Verse 1]
I did it from nothin' ignore my teachers
Lookin' at the hustlers, nigga with the Gucci bucket (Stuntin')
I was 8th grade and I was not paid but never came through not stuntin'
No sense, no rules, couldn't fuck with me
No pets that was iceberg goofy
No pets that was iceberg mutley, okay
Got lot of bodies, swear to God, I'm 'bout to get more
Iceberg shawty, my tag had that Gilmar
You niggas still know what it's in for
I'm at school look'n like I hit a lick for it
Only problem with the fit is I'm 5'6" and the nigga that I swap with is 6'1"
Now it feel, feel, feel good
To be at fashion week with your girl
Fashion week to see Robyn
Fashion week in my fur
Feel, feel, feel good, I gotta keep it 100
Been rocking Bape that niggas got today but today the camo come from...

Look at my bag, shit was a bag
Humbly stuntin' on hoes, fuck it, who want me to brag?
Cool, I know a model from Seoul and I know some models from SoHo
None of them don't got no poke out but can't tell with them Vitamin clothes on
I like a bitch on her queen shit, Chanel and bitches on Supreme shit
Chasing money on a weekday, exfoliating on the weekend
Hold up, I dun put nigga on, how you gon' play me?
Like I come through with them SB's, Nike Max B, I was wavy
Made snakeskin 3's just for Jay-Z, cop Ye a pair of 4's, that was OG
Though I write and perform, I'm the nice kick God
I could never let a washed nigga fade me, yeah, yeah
Stuntin', stuntin', stuntin' too much
M Dollas made me this shit, one for one it cost too much
Very well, are you done? He only told me such
Mike Amiri showed me up, Maxfieldâ€™s open, so clutch
Feel, feel, feel good and there's a delay on the way to S.H.I.N.E
And Rodeo drive that be your cloak, nigga that
