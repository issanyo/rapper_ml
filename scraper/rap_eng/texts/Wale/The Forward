My name's Wale, you probably know me from the you know
Aye that was one of my favorite joints man
You remember that day of mine?
Shit
That's one of my favorite lines cause
You know I'm hard to please man
You know that
But you won me over nigga
You can't lose yourself in this shit holmes
Cannot do it man, it's too many lives at stake
You know we do this shit for the district
Them youngins man
Them youngins that don't have a voice
Nobody was before us man
Nobody made it this far
We do this for all our homies behind the wall
Who never got a chance to see this movement in real form
You gotta remember this shit man
You do this for them young niggas who we inspire and open the musical doors for
We are the district, Wale
We the district, nigga
We can't lose ourselves
This blood run too thick
This district culture too raw
Yo like AB said nigga, the dream is real
Let's live in it
We already fled our homes
We been fucking up the DC club scene since platinum days nigga
But you always stayed on subject
If these listeners too dumb to understand you gave them subject in the club
At the same token on Chain Music
The never gon get it
My nigga, can you really believe they thought you was talking bout a fuckingchain?
Man, from touring to classic tapes
Nigga you and Dre been the hour sessions since 2007
Now we talking bout Grammys
We talkin bout Grammys nigga
You understand that?
Can you believe that?
We up for a Grammy nigga
We ain't got shit else to prove
We already did the unthinkable
Man, listen Ralph
You just gotta give these niggas Folarin
