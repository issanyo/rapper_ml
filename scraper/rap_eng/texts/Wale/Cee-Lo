I’ll shoot a nigga in some Cee-Lo
I’ll put your wifey in a trio
And I can’t lie, it stroked my ego
And they done got me back in beast mode
I got some shooters and they ain’t single
I’m out the country in my T-coat
And these bitches don’t speak no Englo
All they wanna know is the lingo

[Future]
In the Matrix all like I’m Neo
I make movies like Al Pacino
I can wrap a girl like burritos
I go hella hard for them c-notes
They ain’t never seen what we did, nigga
You can’t get fingerprints off these triggers
I’m a guapaholic, I’m money-drunk
Death-defying, I’m livin’ like Avatar
I done went to another planet
See my pockets they on gigantic
I take off like a rocket in Paris
I fuck bitches that don’t mind sharin’

[Hook]

[Wale]
They say Wale dope
They gon’ say what they say, never to my face, no
And I’m runnin’ out of space to put all of my favorite clothes
Took a nigga’s favorite shoes – took a nigga’s favorite store
I call the folk that made ‘em, foreign
These ladies trippin’ …
‘Cause I buck a lot but I don’t be datin’ none of ‘em
And I roll with niggas, go-to niggas, know they ain’t as friendly
And all my pieces wide receivers they all eighty somethin’
Wale, though…
And I make your ladies do my say-so
I’m just a nigga on the grind tryna make moves
Shine like a G, though
Rhyme bully, my mob goodie, shout-out to Cee-Lo

[Hook]

[Ludacris]
Okay, my name is Ludacris and beast mode is what I’m known for
I’m what they need to get Barack Obama on the phone for
Illegal alien – workin’ like a Mexican
Bought a Bugatti and joined forces with the Decepticons
Got so many styles that I don’t even know what I’mma do
But I be killin’ every verse
Make it worth your while, Cadillac style
But I’ll put your favorite rapper in a hearse
Throw him in the grave and write “pussy” on his tombstone
Kidnap his family, make ‘em listen to this new song
DJ Screamin’- partners triple-beamin’
Eight-figure nigga, bitches fightin’ for my semen
Sparta, 300, Leonidas to you fuck boys
Shootin’ three dice with three dykes – what’s good, boys?
