[Intro: Wale & Nas (sample)]
Yes, this shit is raw, comin' at your door
Black and yellow O Dunks Alizé, young Folarin
(Su-Summers off) Wha-what?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Yeah, I want the smoke with most of these niggas
I’m way doper than niggas, I make a ghost of these niggas
Nah, I want the smoke with like all of these niggas
My slime get you his nickel load den he got to wet ya
I'm bicoastal, bipolar, I buy clothes a lot
My bi bitches my best friends, we fucking been through a lot
I'm ducking your crew never, I’m checking your tour route
My niggas'll bust your bus up until it's morgue now
Some niggas was court seats, now niggas is courtside
Same niggas'll take your head off like they was Lee Corso
Mm, damn, the watermelon leaking
I'm unconventional 'cause I'm shy, but that loud speaking
Yeah, and I'm from a gentrified city
Ironic, they cake walk while niggas would pie flip at the
Broads tell me to chill, broads with me to fuck
You can call me whatever, just put that boss in front
Proud, black and I’m rich, and I’m strapped, pull up
Don't call a hater a hater, I say it’s cowardly love
In and out of the clubs and I'm out with these hoes
In-N-Out with the burger, I'm sure to hit Bossa Nova
'Bout to flex at Katana, Mr. Hefner, but darker
All my women are sexy and too articulate for you
Texting I miss ’em, I'm horny, fly in and dive in her middle
Bite on her kitten, it's purring, her body weak and important
Leak up the sheet, said she oversleep 'cause of me in the morning
If she get to geekin', I stop, see a nigga decent but nah
And she wanna meet up too much, I tell her I'm vegan, hol' up
And I want my guys in the Forbes and I want my females in Lyft
And I know my day ones will put it down if my haters pull up
Oh, see, that mean I'm crazy, Uchis Kali, what's up?
O.T., that mean my game tight [?]
Mm, bucka-bucka, Folarin

[Chorus: Nas (sample)]
Take summers off
I- I take summers off
I take
I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef
Take
I take summers off 'cause I
I take- I take
I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef

[Verse 2: Wale & Nas (sample)]
Okay, Wale, niggas coming home, we gon' party
Northeast, shout out to my dawgs Pat and Big E
Proceed, I been going hard 2018
They taught I'd stop fighting, it's Conor and Khabib, I got it
Any flow, they done started getting shoes
They done started talking trip, I'm drowning in Penny Phoams
I just left that complex, should've put Canaries on
Walk right in that riot like we got it, nigga, there it go
2019 approaching, I'm 'bout to get back flexing
Meek, Folarin and Rozay Zion, RJ, Krzyzewski
Duke it out and we want the smoke like a hookah house
I bet them dudes mount like they coup de grace on the Moon bouncin'
Do as I say, not as I do, that is my
Real advice for you niggas bitin'
On my side sub 45 and oversizings
On my side hate 45 and whoever ride with him
I am famous and anxiety riddels my damn mind every minute
I chill out and forget it by getting high, my nigga
No, don't try a nigga 'cause I ain't 'bout to forgive 'em
You push buttons, eventually push flowers, I meant it
A real dawg sleep on me, I still ball
I'm feeling like Josh Hart, I'm feeling like Jamal Crawford
Silly me fed the media for a second
I know they sick, now it's titled Joe, yo Ebro, wanna check it?
(Take summers off) Boy, I dropped three EPs
The fiends came back scratching, oh y'all niggas need me ay
(I take) Shots from niggas that [?] for living
From writers that need jobs, when I react, they get 'em
A lil' bag, they get 'em a lil' check
I get in my lil' feelings and really just wanna smack
A nigga and they retract, retract
I'm like nah, you said it, I walk away relaxed
They think it's done but they finished, it's winter
(Take) Nigga, no [?] answer
Nigga
I take summers off 'cause I
I take- I take
I take summers off 'cause I love winter beef
Woo!
