[Speaking: Wale]
Aye turn the Beat up
U got all them drums in there
Turn it all......
Can I get it up some more?
Look

[Verse 1: Wale]
Yea, Im tryna find where your mind at
A little reefer lotta people and cognac
Dope sneakers and dope speakers for fly cats
And tell them bitches we real niggas is bout that
I ain't tripping all my women be authentic
Sippin then call a cab nobody know their limit
Young nigga with old spirit and ambition
These hoes say I'm a poet I try to make em different
She said she wanna man, told her im real rap
A good head on her shoulders, I need to feel that
She said it really dont matter if its real though
For real though see its mine cause I paid for it
Weaved up greased up shawty what it do?
Cornrows sewed up shawty bust a move
Straight frontin you lacefrontin just come thru
You say these niggas lying well you been lying too

[Hook] x8
Go 'head!

Young Folarin, young Folarin!
They gotta point em out baby
It's only right

[Verse 2: Wale]
Tell em bitches they can get up on my level
Tell em sadity bitches that we really never love em
Tell em the pretty bitch is a pretty bitch to a sucker
Tell em their ambitions then we need some more of them
No girlfriends, I know a lot of bitches
I say bitch a lot, though I'm proud of my sisters
I'm a form a petition, someone gotta be listening
Someone gotta be telling someone somebody is tripping
What the fuck is you wearing?
Why the fuck don't you care?
'Fore you love you a nigga, try loving your kids
She said she model, so exotic in every pic
She on media take out, but don't take out her kids
Freak pics on the low to the paid niggas
Bust ya own damn flight couldn't get a sitter
Bet your whole damn life is a big gimmick
Tell me what it is, we know what it isn't
Now what it is, look look [x6]

[Verse 3: Wale]
I think found where your mind was
A lot of women ainâ€™t proud unless they dolled up
Black women hold it down shawty, it's all love
And even if we wear rubber, they be wrapped up
What it look like? She stay in "Chi-town"
I make her take off, I make her Lake Shore
She stay in Crenshaw she never had a perm
I better straighten it out, soon as I get to work
Shawty stay up in Philly, shawty was hella pretty
Sloppy head for free Yacky head was sixty
I'm a bad motherfucker
Young fly nigga, getting cash motherfucker
Saratoga to the Cordas, nigga what it is?
Landover, Landover nigga what it is
Richmond Carolina nigga what it is
I'm just trynna show the people nigga what it is
The differences between being queen and being bitch
I'm seeing things that's being mean making me sick
Booty shots, fake eyes, fake bitches, fake broads
And you ask twitter why you getting fake guys

A go head [x4]
It's yo head it's yo world [x2]
