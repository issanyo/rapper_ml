[Intro]

[Hook: Morell]:
Get some more bottles, let them get some more bottles
Let them get some more bottles, get some - get some more bottles
Let them get some more bottles, let them get some more bottles
Let them get some more bottles, let the models get tipsy

[Verse 1: Ice Prince]:
See these niggas acting fly like say them be catfish
If you read their mind, you go know say Wande Coal no black reach
Them see me for streets and them no say I no dey lack shit
We in the building and we here till the building collapses
GRAAA
I'm the President
Badder than the best of them
Riding with the kings, the gunpowder for the rest of them
Them wan' make I fall flat, but I'm bouncing the accident
I'm on a song with Chip so you I'm kicking with wretch and em'
Lot of niggas look up to me, me sef, I dey try learn
Some of them dey shiver cuz e be like say na my turn
Them no fit compare me, omo, dada no be sideburn
These rappers say I'm sweet, na me be sugar wey dey dry sperm
Niggas wanna beef with us, carry am go far away
I dey kick some ass, I no be Omotola Jalade
Man, they  wanna fuck with us, but I think it's sorta 'k
The way I shine the light e come dey be like say na Farade
Bad man killer, Ice Prince, nigga
White fans, and I ain't a light skinned nigga
Red eye, me no need a visine, nigga
Fuck with the clique, and you gon' see the fight scene bigger

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]:
Surulere can relate
Goons out in Ondo State
Take you on the realest, so I put a pussy in his place
Yoruba my fucking name, women love to touch my face
??? when I'm in the States
Realest state of mind I'm in, grew up by the monument
When I got my deal, I brought the whole fucking naija in
Now we on a Island with jollof and I be buyin'
Some felines from the Bahamas, me and Ice Prince showing how to live

Get my Super Eagle on, start to kick it till the break
Man, a million from a plate, so the city know my name
And my cuzzo call me Dayo, but these women call me Dre

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ice Prince]:
You see me for news now i’m the new Cyril Sto-ber

And me i show no pity, i dey wear the same shirt with Diddy
But that’s how you roll when you from Jay town or Lasgidi

[Hook: Morell]:
Get some more bottles, let them get some more bottles
Let them get some more bottles, get some - get some more bottles
Let them get some more bottles, let them get some more bottles
Let them get some more bottles, let the models get tipsy
