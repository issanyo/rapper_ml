[Post-Chorus]
Never knew a love like yours
Until I found you
And I done been in trouble before
But nothing like you
Never seen a woman so pure
Until I found you (pure, uncut, nigga)

But nothing like you (like you, hey yeah)

[Verse 1]
I don't mean to call you out, I know we got history
I hear the word of mouth, I know that you're no good for me
I hear the famous tale, they say you, changed a little, I know
The eighties made you rock hard, you and I was just babies then
Her daddy named Ronald, he's famous here
Live close but still a long way from here
The rumour go the mayor had a thing for ya
And you and daddy both did him and Rayful in
Home wrecker, just statin' facts
She the reason some people don't got a dad
Gold digger, rich nigga, just got to ask you
Was you Len Bias? Last (toke) at the draft?
Taboo taboo cocaine white, voodoo come through, she paralysed
Who knew she would come through so ill-advised
Genocide then gentrified her
And she still be out here
From the hood to Hollywood
She the coldest white bitch this side of town
I got a

[Chorus]
New 600 cocaine white (yeah)
New Air Ones cocaine white (yeah)

And I done been in love before
But nothing like you (like you, hey yeah)

[Verse 2]
She like hoes, and I like hoes
She the type meet a nigga any night
Fuck his life up and brag that his life ghost
That's how it go
When you wanna roll
I be in the ear, she be in they nose
New girlfriend cocaine white
Black girls prolly pop veins the same night
She was on the train off the late night
She knew a mule or two that she would play tight
Pull a mask out, break her down, then pass her out
Her daddy foul but her mama a flower
And it's always fire in the glass-house, yeah
