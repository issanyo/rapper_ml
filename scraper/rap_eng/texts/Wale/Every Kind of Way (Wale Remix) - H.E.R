[Verse 1: Wale]
I heard I cracked the code to your heart
Cause the one that before me
Couldn't figure it out
Sex was the weapon
My tongue will gun ya down (yeah)
Sex was best one ain't no love aloud
Sometimes i think
99% of our bodies are lying
Why don't our minds agree
She heard my title peace
Trying [?] just to see why
Am I this nigga fighting asleep
That's what entitlement means
She told me be careful like Cardi B
But my cardio gotten smaller
Small like a car don't got wings
Gods Plan
Shawty ain't tryna b
We can sit and I'm good
I lick ya neck and then
I bet ya I'm setting the mood
Bet you I'm different
Bet that you is lost mayne
My jeweler is accomplished
Come on whenever you want
A young intellectual who became a boss
But don't mess with the strippers
With pistols in they Goyard
Sophisticated or the ratchets
I can't ignore both
The Issa Raes and Lissa Anns
Its insecure now
I can see your plans for us
Cupid got his aiming scoped
Better tell him stop playing with us
Cause if we shooting we not friends no more

[Verse 2: H.E.R.]
Baby, the sound of you
Better than a harmony
I want you off my mind
And on me
Holding me closer than we've ever been before
This ain't a dream
You're here with me
Boy, it don't get no better than you
For you, I wanna take my time
All night

[Chorus H.E.R.]
I wanna love you in every kind of way
I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes
If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today
I'm gonna love you in every kind of way

[Verse 3: H.E.R]
Give you all, give you all of me
When you need it
'Cause I need it
I wanna fall like your favorite season
I'll never get up
Stay here forever, babe
It don't get no better than this
Your kiss

[Chorus: H.E.R.]
I wanna love you in every kind of way
I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes
If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today
I'm gonna love you in every kind of way
I wanna love you in every kind of way
I wanna please you, no matter how long it takes
If the world should end tomorrow and we only have today
I'm gonna love you in every kind of way

[Outro: H.E.R.]
I wanna love you
I gotta love you
I wanna love you
I gotta love you
