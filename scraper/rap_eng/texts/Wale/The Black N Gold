[Talking: Wale]
Here ye, here ye
Let's toast
Let's celebrate life, let's celebrate wealth, and bypass plight, for the night
Drinks up

[Verse 1: Wale]
Back like I never left in the first
Wale Ovenchkin, the best on the earth, breath breath full of purp
A legend out here, and I'm ending careers by the end of my year
Two course when you mention my gear, lil low low lil showboat, nigga since MoCo
Rosay for the hoes in the V-I, P-P-I, gotta do it more like T.I
Whatever you like, it's whatever tonight
I might give you the pipe unless you pedaling bikes
I mean Cycling, I was liking it
Hit me up in a couple days, we can try again
I need henny on the rock, my queen top notch
And I keep a fly girl like Jenny from the block
Got HU women, Frostburg women
Throw around game, Strasburg pitching
Tonight no pitchers, everything's straight
And we gonna toast up for the niggas that hate
And we gonna drink dark, we gonna take it to the face
And I got them gold bottles, first place
No metal here, I'm well away
Y'all Mario brothers, I'm Metal Gear
I don't ever fear nothing, I'm forever here
Hands up DJ, let let em hear

[HOOK]
If you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
I wanna be next to you
Black and Gold, Black and Gold, Black and Gold
Black and Gold, Black and Gold, Black and Gold
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the, champagne for the, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the, champagne for the, champagne for the hoes

[Verse 2: Wale]
I'm faded and y'all ain't it
I'm ninja gaiden and y'all lil Jayden
It's Roc Nation, this my team
Go and this my team then I ditch y'all, lay in
Hey man y'all just fakin, and cheap hoes love a nigga like H&M
Rich hoes love a nigga like Ray-Bans
I don't know what y'all heard, but hip hop ain't dead
I could change a broad's life in about an hour
I turn ducks into bucks, Luke Ridnour
Y'all had your run, don't ruin ours
Watch a young nigga operate, Dougie Howser
I don't really like the Hollywood scene
The dudes all fake and the girls are bulimic
The drinks too weak, what the fuck is a Bellini?
But you would never think if you seen it on TV
DMV, what I rep, off GP
I make it rain Sean Kemp, GP
I make words come alive, GP
Create life with the beats, Alicia Keys
Fore we do the unthinkable
I'm gonna need a tree, a freak, and a chicken too
Whatchu thinkin boo?
Whatchu want love? Fuck a cold sore, getcha getcha own cup

[HOOK]
If you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
I wanna be next to you
Black and Gold, Black and Gold, Black and Gold
Black and Gold, Black and Gold, Black and Gold
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the, champagne for the, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the hoes
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the, champagne for the, champagne for the hoes
