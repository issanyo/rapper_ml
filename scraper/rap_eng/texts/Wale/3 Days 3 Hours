[Intro]
Can't be without you, baby
Not even for a night
And so I've been thinking lately
Of being with you for all time

[Verse 1]
Mmm, it's four-thirty in Eastern time where I'm at, shorty
In the A.M., I'm sayin' though, where you at, shorty?
I'm happy without you but got my doubts, shorty
Like, like if my currency dry out, would you be out thirsty?
Would your mind want me, like your soul want me?
When I go down on you, I drown for quarter centuries
You a whole globe, you a whole earth
And I'm a troubled millionaire that fears you know your worth
Absence makes the heart grow fonder so we ponder
On the things we gon' do when distance ain't a problem
Our intentions, they was honest, we was cordial, we was talkin'
We was hidin', there was no one, we was lyin', it was fuckin'
Foreplay with your body divided now
It's forehead kisses before my flight departed, that
Showed me the feelings, about to play with that
Three days away, three hours back, hold on

[Bridge]
Can't be without you, baby
Ain't got no voice
Where my phone? Who got my phone? You got my phone?
She called me, hold on man
(You have reach the voicemail box)
Hol' up

[Verse 2]
Just got off the stage, know you sleepin', but wait
Just lost my voice for this crowd I only seen your face in Everywhere, but these women real as a fairy tale
Can barely talk but you hit my line, I'ma hear you well
I need that vibe from you 'cause spendin' time on this bus
Take the power from my brain, in-between your thighs they should rest
We alive, we in love, we can die if we don't
If monogamy you want then share your time with Pornhub (ha!)
I'm just playin', just need you know I'm lonely
Green Tea, Ricola and Honey Gold
We missin' each other more so we horny or don't speak
Three hours apart, cool, two days and you seein' me
My vocals is now shot, call up doctor, steroid me
We cortisone 'til my quarter zone is back as your toy please
I know you don't need nothin' but what I got
Two days away, three hours back, goodnight

[Bridge]
(Can't be without you, baby)
We one tomorrow away from celebratin' that that very tomorrow's the day (Not even for a night)
I know it's late but I'ma hit you later
(And so I been thinking lately of being with you for all time)

[Outro]
I'm on the way, you know
Once you know my voice back
'Cause see like a hunnid forevers plus a day since I last seen the livin' embodiment of my forever
Face to face and I might just inject your body with knowledge
Your body with style, you'll be flyer than Rox Brown
Okay, I'm lyin', nobody flyin' than Rox
But I might just get in a half squat position and proposition you with a shiny rock under an open box
So the onlookers can understand that we all official
We all just kids lookin' for the first love we ever injected
So whenever I'm never next to you, I never look to the next woman even on her best moment to bestowed
A stove you kept warm for me, as I kept distance you kept cookin'
Sugar, we went from three days and three hours 'til we two days and three hours to, "girl he think he Darius Lovehall, he walkin' down the street writin' poetry to make the between yo' knees feel like you need balance"
And I see you alot but I see you on camera so it seem like a lie when I say I need to see us together
From three days to two days, from two days to today
From today to tonight, from tonight to forever, I'm up the street
