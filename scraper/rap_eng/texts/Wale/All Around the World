[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
I been all around the world
Came from the bottom, aiming for the top
And I'm still climbing
Say what you wanna but
I'm not coming down
I been all around the world
I still got haters
Blacktop shades
You came blazin'
Baby heading down a cloud

[Verse 1: Tiara Thomas]
I'm on my pedestal
Yeah I said it ho
Fuck whoever said the rap game wasn't edible man
I'm incredible homie I been beasting
I be murdering bars
Y'all leave bee stings
Sippin' bitches what lemonade
I ain't even made it
You already afraid
You already are caged
You fucking lab rabbits
You was hot for a season
Little industry gadgets
You scatterbrains
So much to say a scrabble game
But habits have changed and I've been trying to change mine all the way
But I feel my transformation gon' smash the entire game
My brothers alone said fuck your entire
Name, and your entire
Fame, What you know about it
I take the title from ya'
What you gon' do about it
You're emotional bitch, Fuck your period
Your reign of glory, your balls wetter ending the sentences
Hate me if you want to but always remember this
That I'm the future of this game, and of course I spit this shit
I'm not A but I'm the bitch
MC Hammer too legit
And more than confident
Anybody ever doubted me
Coming back with this shit bitch

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
I been all around the world
Came from the bottom, aiming for the top
And I'm still climbing
Say what you wanna but
I'm not coming down
I been all around the world
I still got haters
Blacktop shades
You came blazin'
Baby heading down a cloud

[Verse 2: Wale]
Who got the flow?
Its somethin like Manute Bol
Blowin' fluke horns, I'm not high
Bitch I'm four wings, I'm two flies, I'm net fly
I ain't with that hoopla, dolo and the coopers
I maneuver the two-cloud smokin' like I'm supposed to
Flowin' like I'm in poker, you neverï»¿ know my emotion
Never will you survive if you ever rhyme for a poser
I just light up and focus
I just ride for the coaches
I just ride for my niggas and give the bitches the business
Callin' these bitches cuz bitches ain't even women
Yeah
We been all around the world
You gon' know a lot of haters when you know a lot of girls
I know a lot of money bring a whole lot of vultures
That's why a little more bring a whole lot of toasters
Cooler system on it
Pray you never use it
But I ain't tryna see my momma
See a nigga blueish
Album coming soon
Sneaker may come sooner
I got alotta phones
I'm Alleta Reluva
Far as lyrical precision I'm imperial loser
Inferior clueless niggas ain't really conducive
To what we doing here
Fuck is you doing here
I swear these bitches look up to me like I'm doing here
Tear zero
You appear as if you care
Haters you hate on the lives now they hate on the player
Player
You like how I said player didn't ya gentlemen
Playrrrr
Ha

[Hook: Wale]
And I been all around the world
Smoking my reefer
With my dope sneakers
Thousand dollar jeans
Keep the bitches on my dick
'Cuz a nigga so clean cuz
I been all around the world
Smoking on the doja
