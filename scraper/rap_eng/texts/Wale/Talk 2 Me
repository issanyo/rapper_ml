Talk to me Wale, you know we had to do it again bruh bruh
Talk to me [x5]

[Wale]
What up Bankhead
Hey lil momma, what's your name, I'm Wale but they call me great
PRPS cover my eight’s, uhh, lemme switch my pace
No rims on my Benz-o, just tint ho and good endo
I love a girl that think a lot, cause sex with me is mental
That mental, that brain power, my J rolled and that thing loud
That's OG, I OD, my hoes loud but I'm low-key
It's no drought were I be, bitch no police, here's fire wings
That's five piece that's how I be, I'm proud of me I'm so G
I'm carry out with it, who are y'all kiddin'
Nigga, I live it can't get in my business, can't get with my bitches
Can't get my lyrics, I dont give five shits, come get with my skrilla
Killa I roller cheese blazed, high as fuck and feelin' great
I thought I was out Atlanta, but God damn I'm outta space
Bitch no days off and I ain't got no breaks
And I don't take these bitches out, I make pajama dates
Feed them to some convo and some wine, and take a condom break
If she don't fake, I work that pussy out, like it was outta shape

[Refrain]
I get money then I’m gone that’s a hard pill to swallow
I got money on my phone if you talkin have a convo
Throwin' hundreds then im gone you can't go to the places I go
When that money calls I holla back
Cause gettin to this dough is all I know
I holla back [x6]

[Wale]
She wanna be grown
I know that is your bitch, but she won't leave me ‘lone
Look, she love me from them poems, and them songs, in my zone
And I'm gone and she gone, but she gone home
She say no and she say she on, nigga fuck that, she gone open up we gone puff that
Coconuts Ciroc where Puff at, never fall in love, don't cuff that
While y’all foreplay I punt that, four downs
More rounds, more vodka, more brown, more broads, more loud
More money to count, yeah you know I’m gettin' right
Bet they on my dick tonight, all my women fly as shit, why your bitches scared of heights
Why these broads hear my late call, start rushin' over runnin' lights
Why they try to see my flow, but they know that's outta sight
My Polo cost ends, and bitch I'm dolo, fuck friends, so all who dont know
I’m in so take a photo
My fit is sick as shit can't find these shoes, unless you was out in 92′
Rest in peace that DJ Am, Clark Kent, that's my fuckin' dude, let's go

[Refrain]

[Roscoe Dash]
Money’s on the mental, my efforts monumental
I go more than mental, this is more than Redbull the window
He’s comin', that's what these hoes say
Just Patron and Rose, got these hoes, oops these cameras keep on rollin'
From start until explosion
They down to do it all, I call 'em US open
Big money I can’t fold it, it calls me like I owe it
I don't care nothin' bout it, I hit the mall and blow it
My money’s ever lastin', if you seen me, you would know it
I swear money’s all I know, green I go, I’m Ford focused
I know they mad I’m on, but that's too bad cause err shit, I'm here to stay I brought my bags

[Refrain]
