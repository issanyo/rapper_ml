[Hook]
Your last man was semi pro
Baby I am professional
I'll teach you how to take it slow
Show you all the do's and don't
Be shy when we're all alone
Relax and get comfortable
You gotta breathe and be at ease
Cus you're so sexy

[Verse 1: Black Cobain]
Please loose the le pearl, accommodate my niggas
We sippin' on this liquor 'til I feel I wanna kiss ya
A couple pair of lips, I'm smoochin' on ya panty line
She said she want it now, well girl it's hammer time
Safe sex since you say you not a groupie
Yea I'm only doing sushi with my main girl, excuse me
Loose the lights, Teddy Pendergrass, I'm grooving
I ain't searching for love, cus you tell me that you hoopin'
Whaddup Hoops, tell them it was for the money
If we ain't fucking for the moment then we doin' nothing
Girls be up to something, I'm Bobby Brown and humpin'
I'm hating on ya pussy cus I don't wanna love it
Jus tell me that you love it, I told you that I dug it
Maybe I'mma eat it if you tell me that you suckin'
I'm working while they sleeping, so staying's not an option
But she gon' throw it back like a quarterback option

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
We pro ballin'
I broke mama heart with no college
And now I'm getting brains like my old colleagues
We ain't looking for loving here, only cus it's summer here
Let's enjoy our younger years
Put my number all in there, then I put my love in there
Bet I be all in her head like youngin' from The Wonder Years (haha)
She say that she just gotta have it
And if she have it, she gon' change her Blackberry status
Ignore cus she mad again, then I hit her back again
We can say whatever if we LOLing after it
Love tend to make us all sensitive
I put a condom on my heart, I don't be feeling shit
