[Intro:]
This back this back

[Chorus]
This that shit y’all here for hit y’all with this college flow
Mmm bet yo mama neva know mmm straight to harvard with flow
This that shit y’all here for hit y’all with this college flow
About aloud with that float, how you think i’m passing balls on these hoes

[Verse 1:]
Swag young nigga in that Mustang banging that Wu-Tang
Uh open up two lanes, nigga dance like Chris on the new flame
With a duffle bag just to get two chains
[?] me nigga worry bout your boo thang
Let ya hoe take a ride on the crew train
Like a frat party yea we got ex
All the girls party my dogs got next
Couple black bottles by the case couple black models by the waist
Tell baby girl if she wanna ride with the store hope she pretty as a model on a wraith
Young Folarin somewhere touring
Running through your road soaring foreign
Riding clean when I lay in my lift
I’m a school boy to the man of the year

[Chorus:]
This that shit y’all here for hit y’all with this college flow
Mmm bet yo mama neva know mmm straight to harvard with flow
This that shit y’all here for hit y’all with this college flow
About aloud with that float, how you think i’m passing balls on these hoes
Hold up

[Verse 2:]
This the shit he here for riding high getting low
Get clean hitting hoes on ma pimp shit nigga sipping slow
Getting money while i’m getting more
Talk waist thicker than York’s 60 flow
Got a hundred on that hundred a these
Like 44 millimeters under the sleeve
Fire keep flaming right under the Tees
On fire like wayne 500 degrees
Follow I know every step like a hundred a pop
While the haters throw shade [?]

Won a private jet with a commercial pitch
She can work the pole and she work the wrist
