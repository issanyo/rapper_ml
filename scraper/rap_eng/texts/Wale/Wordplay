[Intro]
Wale, Spitta, 9th Wonder
Class is in session

[Verse 1]
All them niggas pitch verbs, so they say
My weaponry is words, doe-ray-me
The wars in the form of po-et-ry
So it's straight C4 from the thoughts I bring, bang
Epiphany, them niggas is gimmicks to me
I can eradicate a village if you give me a beat, huh
I'm that bomb when that handwrite
Play me for a stepping stone then, I land mine, huh
Now walk to it with your land mind
I can make the clouds jealous nigga I am that fly
Listen to the words I'm a wizard with it
Wittier than any nigga, sicker then a wino kidney liver
Y'all riddles don't tickle a bit
Y'all similes is literal shit
No I'm the metaphor of that, my rhetoric inedible
This excrement means excellent rap, I make a lesser adapt

[Hook]
Word play
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word
Word play, word play
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word
W-word, wh-wh-word, wh-word, wh-wh-word

[Curren$y]
Park my plane right there
Word play
Leave the keys with that bitch, jets

[Verse 2: Curren$y]
Spitta flip syllables for residuals
Majors misbehaving I'mma have to take it digital
Living underground like a Godfather Buried Alive
I ride by bumping Shyne, I do just that
Nigga ain't nothing sweet like a Kool Aid pack
Bitches roll Sweets as I lay back in the suite
Developing cavities cause revenge is sweet
Every time I rap I unwrap another piece
An eighth of grape ape hella joints to the head got my eyes all varsity red
Sunroof flow so over your head
SB horror pack monsters under my bed

[Hook]
