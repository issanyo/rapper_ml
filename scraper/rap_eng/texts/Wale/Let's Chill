[Intro: Wale]
You know I like you like, a little bit
Like a little tiny bit
And the only problem is, if I go inside you gone go insane
Check it...

[Verse 1 - Wale]
Okay heaven sent this melody so let me sing it to ya
And I call you Ms. Folarin see that got a ring, don’t it
And I got this thing for ya my affinity’s infinity
Put that on everything these other bitches anything
Shit
I’m just tryna chill a bit play with it and blaze a bit
Then play you all my latest shit
Lately I been stressing so I need you like I’m crazy
Music's irrelevant and money’s overrated
That’s why I spend it like I look at it with hatred
To look at you is painful, cuz I ain’t seen you naked
But I’ma wait it out I’m bout to see that drought
Cuz if I hit it now these feelings take a different route
So, I’m on some 40 days and night shit
Feeling like it’s Ramadan and I just need a bite quick
Tryna get inside your mind without that night shift
So I’ma be aight for the night with a goodbye kiss

[Hook - Lloyd]
Let’s chill
Girl I don’t want to rush tonight
Take your time when you’re with me baby
So I can give you what you need, I know what you like
Let’s Chill
It’s obvious that girl you’re fine
But I just wanna make love to your mind
So if you open up your heart I’ll give you mine
Let’s Chill

[Verse 2 - Wale]
Usually ain’t nothing
Usually one and done up she done up and looking beautiful
That don’t mean I’ma stunt her
No need to rush it, we got forever babygirl
We getting closer every moment I’ve been waiting for it
Ain’t saying I don’t need it, if you gave it I would take it
Have you shakin' I would break you off
Without a second thought, but you got my respect is all
And I can show you all this love without a bit of sex involved
Maybe I foreplay it, maybe I kiss it lady
And even if we don't speak, you still are in my matrix
That’s how this lovin be, love it when she under me
She say that she celibate, I penetrate her mentally
So if it’s meant to be, then it’s meant to be
Hold on to the now, cuz I know sex be changing everything
If it’s meant to be, then it’s meant to be
She say "I think I’m ready, if it change just remember me"

[Hook - Lloyd]

[Verse 3 - Wale]
If you ready then I'm ready go, hear this on my radio
Hennessey is in my blood, don't tell me you gon' tell me no
Tell me that you love me most, I tell you you the only one
Tell me where you want me go, nevermind I know what's up
Come and see what I'm about, pull your hair you say my name
Now you scratchin' on my back, I see your pleasure in my pain
She crack a smile, I'm finna turn it out
Probably won't last long, you know it's been a while

[Hook - Lloyd]

Ooooohhhhh!
C’mon and let’s chill baby
Yeah
Let’s chill
