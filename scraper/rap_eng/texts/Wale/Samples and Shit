[Intro: Wale]
This the hip-hop shit they be crying for, right?
Saying I ain't got it, or I ain't with it
You bull shit, look

[Verse 1]
In a room full of goons, I'm such a fucking stand out
I prefer your applause without a handout
So refrain from the clap like a Prophylac
Touring through the warmest cities with the coldest raps
Rolling with the dopest hoes and they don't know I rap
I still be splitting women like a bogus hocus-pocus act
Smell the folgers get the scrotum out your focus
I can't drink what niggas serving, there's no wonder why I po' it
It's no wonder why I go in any hood like I ain’t no one
'Cuz they love you when you real, they just like you when your flowing
And they like when I influence, and so perfectly, I do it
So check my net worth, and I got them jerseys moving
Word to Shawn Corey, and you know what I am doing
Got a movement for these niggas, God bless who's not into it

[Verse 2]
Nigga, lyrically gifted, second to only religious scriptures
Ripley's Believe it Or Not would tell you that I'm different
Lift up your seat and just stop, or did you think I would flop?
Go take the "p" out, put a "w", you'll see what I got
I make the senile make sense, I make Moschino a lot
Although I beat up a track, I make a C Note make knot
I'm feeling like the realest little nigga in this business
Real enough to admit I listen to people's opinions
I'm tough enough to dismiss 'em, but real enough to petition
Dependent on if it's hatred or an objective opinion
I respectfully tell 'em, "I get it, you just don't feel it"
You just don't like what I'm doing, the lyrics Twitter my image
I ain't bitter my nigga, I respect your position
Fuck what they selling, it's reality living in the mirror
'Cuz of that I never let up, 'cuz of that I keep my head up
Temporary the richest, legendary's forever
Just remember I said it, by the end of November
And I need this forever
