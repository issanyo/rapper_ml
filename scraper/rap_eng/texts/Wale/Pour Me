[Intro: Elle Varne]
Thinkin' ’bout you, been drinkin' 'bout you

[Verse 1: Wale & Elle Varne]
You a fly lil’ baby
Should be my lil' baby
I arrive in your thighs
Put butterflies in your navel
And my eyes gettin' lazy
That's the high that you give me
I'm too faded to drive so my attendance your driver seat
And I'm thinkin' 'bout you
All the things we could do with our time, yeah
Thinkin’ ’bout you, been drinkin' ’bout you
And I'm drinkin' 'bout you
Let me feast on my foot, yeah
Thinkin’ 'bout you, been drinkin'

[Verse 2: Elle Varne]
I'm starin' at the window, at the rain fallin'
It's how it feels when you ain't callin'
Let's make a deal 'cause I ain't ballin'
Can we keep it real? 'Cause I hate stallin'
Clock's tickin' ever slowly
You could be gettin' to know me
But I loved you as a homie
Now I'm cryin' and sayin', "Pour me"

[Chorus: Elle Varne]
So pour me one more
One more, one more, one more
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, been drinkin' 'bout you
All night, for sure
Won't you pour me one more?
One more, one more, one more
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, been drinkin' 'bout you
Might even hit the dance floor
Might even hit the dance floor

[Verse 3: Elle Varne]
I bet you havin' fun with that girl now
You should be over here in my house
Kickin' your feet up on my couch
I could feed you what you need now
Sweet love, cook soul food
That's what I got up on the menu
Crazy how you could have been knew
What's the best thing for you
But baby

[Chorus: Elle Varne]
Pour me one more
One more, one more, one more
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, been drinkin' 'bout you
All night, for sure
Won't you pour me one more?
One more, one more, one more
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, been drinkin' 'bout you
Might even hit the dance floor

[Verse 4: Wale]
Okay, pour me up then throw it back
Shot glass, then you lower back
Truth come when the bottle done
Throw a D'USSÉ like I'm low on cash
Mmm, that's right
Love me right, I'ma love you back (All night)
Lil' mama tight but never low on cash
Co-workers don't even know I rap
Kinda liked that, 'til you blew the spot
When I pulled up and like, "Girl, who? Bitch, that's you"
And you just laughed
I'm not a regular guy
You not a regular gal
I don't really know a damn thing
'Bout this love thing, but I'm tryin' to try
I'm not a regular guy, no
You not a regular gal
You don't really know the champ pain
So I champagne every time you wine
Yeah, oh no

[Chorus: Elle Varne]
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, and I'm drinkin' 'bout you
And I know that I can't drive
Huh, not tonight, not tonight, not tonight
One more, one more, one more
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, been drinkin' 'bout you
All night, for sure
Pour me one more
One more, one more, one more
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, been drinkin' 'bout you
Might even hit the dance floor
