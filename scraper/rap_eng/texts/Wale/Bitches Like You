[Hook: Wale]
Y'all bitches don’t know me no more
Cause I'm done fucking bitches like you
Y'all bitches don’t know me no more
Cause I'm ducking all the bitches like you
Y'all bitches don’t believe me no more
That I'm done hitting bitches like you
Y'all bitches don’t see me no more
Cause I'm switching up on bitches like you

[Verse 1: Wale]
I gracefully move, I really hate to be rude
She say, Wale do you miss me? I say, well I miss the roof
Blowing shit in these streets, high as shit in this booth
Fly as shit when you see me, my pilot shift never through
I'm thinking deeper the most, not a Libra, but close
Im a virgo that rocking fur, like PETA wassup!
Y'all bitches don’t know me no more, can't say I never did see
See I'm just a fucking entertainer, try taming your kids
I'm carrying Bs, I'm chasing success
I wait for the perfect woman, that make up the rest
You worried 'bout Bey, you worried 'bout Kim
Look, them girls do not know you, worry 'bout this dick

[Hook: Wale]
Y'all bitches don’t know me no more
Cause I'm done fucking bitches like you
Y'all bitches don’t know me no more
Cause I'm ducking all the bitches like you
Y'all bitches don’t believe me no more
That I'm done hitting bitches like you
Y'all bitches don’t see me no more
Cause I'm switching up on bitches like you

[Verse 2: Cam'ron]
I told my old bitch I ain't fucked you since Jodeci (1999)
I'm the water, you the bridge, get over me
She said nah, she had hood fights over me
She'll never look over me, it's my fault, I suppose be
Never should have stuck it in her ovaries
Put it in her groceries and it ain't help I'm a fly nigga
And the crib smelling like Potpourri
Left that in her eyes, but that pussy said open me
5 years later, she was thick, scratch, choking me
That was 5 years ago, she still here scoping me
Please leave, I will open the door
You don't know me no more

[Hook: Wale]
Y'all bitches don’t know me no more
Cause I'm done fucking bitches like you
Y'all bitches don’t know me no more
Cause I'm ducking all the bitches like you
Y'all bitches don’t believe me no more
That I'm done hitting bitches like you
Y'all bitches don’t see me no more
Cause I'm switching up on bitches like you
