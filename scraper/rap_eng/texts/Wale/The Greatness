[Intro: Raheem DeVaughn]
Be my greatness, God made you
And I'ma send this one out, to all the women of the world
Konnichiwa ladies, when you can't seem to find yourself, and the mirror don't talk back to you, from the hood to the pulpit back to the hood again, your greatness

[Verse 1: Raheem DeVaughn]
Under the gloss on your lips there's greatness
What lies between those jeans on your hips is such greatness
The words that part your mouth (your mouth), the swagger in your flow
Girl with you the makeup that you wear and the way you wear your hair

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn]
Inside out, out, out (I love you)
Inside out, out, out (your greatness)
When you don't feel beautiful in all
Like the mirror on your wall
I'll let you know, your beautiful

[Verse 2: Raheem DeVaughn]
Inside them Giuseppe's on your feet girl there's greatness
And ba-bay, Victoria holds the secrets to your greatness
Under your pedicure and under your manicure girl, ooh there's greatness, mhmm greatness
You got a twinkle in your eye, baby lookin' like the sky and that's greatness, oooh that's your greatness
You got a smile that shines like the sun, so baby don't let no one never steal your greatness, your greatness, ooh

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn]
Inside out, out, out (I love you yeah, from head to toe)
Inside out, out, out (inside, so when you don't feel beautiful at all)
When you don't feel beautiful in all
Like the mirror on your wall (I'll let you know)
I'll let you know, your beautiful (I'll let you know)
Inside out, out, out (from head to toe girl)
Inside out, out, out (I adore you)
When you don't feel beautiful in all
Like the mirror on your wall
I'll let you know
