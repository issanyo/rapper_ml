M-M-M-Maybach Music

[Verse 1]
In and out of town [?] us
Skin brown so the cops busting
Cockroaches ain't got to love me
Top charts since dropping lotus
Drop top the car show it
Drop top your bra showing
Tammy Lahren I ain't ready for you
All the Becky's want a uncle Tom Sawyer
Race draft first pick
John Lennon for Don Lemon
Omarosa for a palm tree
Your lil' son see we both shady niggas
DC crazy nigga
Woop woop
PG crazy nigga
Woop woop
We see 12 pull up
Woop woop
Feet don't fail me nigga
I got the moves like Sean tonight
I got the juice like soccer wives
I ain't romantic but I got a Wraith
So take the pussy under stars tonight
If it's on then it's on for life
If it's squad then it's squad for life
If it's a foreign in your neighborhood and you see a Ghost say Folarin in it right
That petty humor makes your bitch choose
House wives call me home improvement
I say your name they say mani-pedi, they don't even got a toe or nail improvement
Hottest out what I got to do to show you stupid putos who the hottest doing
What they trying to do but they as not as fluent
Shine season give me number 2
Money where is number number 2
I just did a fucking number 2
Money where is number number 2
I just did a fucking number 2
Shine season and it's my season heard that Cool and Dre is in the other room
Keep going

Part II
[Beat Switch]

[Bridge: Sam Sneak]
Oh shit this the part where the shit goes left right
Or do it go right
Or no we go up
Whatever
Talk to them

[Chorus]
Woosaa woosaa
I been working too hard, too hard
Woosaa woosaa
I been grinding too hard, my god
Draco draco draco draco all you niggas fake though
You, you
Draco draco draco draco all you niggas fake though
Said woosaa woosaa
I been working too hard too hard
Woosaa woosaa
I been grinding too hard, my god

[Verse 2]
Draco draco draco draco, dress your favorite in that halo
Hitters, they from Haiti don't you make me sak pase so
Maybe I am crazy cause I'm wavy out my way though
Give a bitch a baby way before she get the Seiko
Draco draco draco have you ever seen a draco?
You ever had a sweeper when you squeeze it make you shake up?
Faking faking faking faking, all you niggas fronting
How you taking Xannys trying to operate a weapon?
What the fuck is up?
Niggas looking real sus
Ask him whereâ€™s his passport he rap about the plug enough
I ain't trapping I just know what's up
Label me that pro black backpacker that bitches love
All I see is hoe ass rap niggas in every the club
All I see is the Instagram pictures that's tricking us
All I need is all my black niggas to live it up
Cause North Korea might go bat shit, fuck you little guns

[Chorus]
Woosaa woosaa
I been workin' too hard, too hard, yeah
Woosaa woosaa
I been grindin' too hard, my god
Draco draco draco draco all you niggas fake though
You, you, you
Draco draco draco draco all you niggas fake though
Said woosaa woosaa
I been workin' too hard, too hard, yeah
Woosaa woosaa
I been grindin' too hard, my god
