[Bridge: Damond Blue]
Blue moon on your mind
New moon, we gon' shine
Baby roll with me
Girl I keep it round my arm, woah

[Verse 1: Damond Blue]
Yeah and you gon' go with me
Look at ya baby, yeah you a rare breed
I swear I'm hooked on you baby, look how you kill the scene
Always clean, that's just the way it be
First 48, she on the A&E
She hit the (?) she lookin' like the morning
And shorty perfect, I might as well give her all of me
And she don't want it once, she need it two or three
I give it to you like all night long
Tell the DJ he can play my song
More bottles till the break of dawn
You deserve it girl, your week been long
Come here baby, you drive me crazy
Move your body, girl don't be lazy, no
Out the shower look like "ah good God"

[Hook: Damond Blue]
Baby bless your heart
Your body's a work of art
I'll take you to Mars
Come ride with a star
And I'll give it to you
Enjoy this new view
While I give it to you
Give it to you
While I give it to you
Baby this a drop
They should buy the car
I'll take you to Mars
Come ride with a star
Enjoy this new view

[Bridge: Damond Blue]
Blue moon on your mind
New moon, we gon' shine
Baby roll with me
Girl I keep it round my arm, woah

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yeah, your body's an unfinished mural
Overdone sculpture
I mean if Madame Toussaint made you, well that's your part
Took them apart, added 'em to a normal person
(?) girthy
I run around like Todd Gurley
LA status on my hair early
You can't hurt me, my plans are workin'
My shit is not Lord then you in the wrong clergy
Certainly they can't fuck with me though
They can't fuck with me though
Bad bitches can't get enough of me though

[Interlude]
It's the part
Blue, blue, blue, blue
(What up Wale?)

[Verse 3: Damond Blue]
Girl that ass and face combined
Make me wanna thank your mom
Girl I see ya, bring it back come rewind
Powerful impact, boom, from the cannon
It's the remix, yeah I had to let you have it
I'ma give it to ya, no really baby I'm gonna give it to ya
Honestly you're perfect, got designer on the purses
Like "God you're gorgeous, ah you're flawless"
If love's a crime give me all them charges
Whew a masterpiece when you in the nude
Your body's a work of art, you the perfect muse
Next to Mona Lisa, put you in the Louve
I just wanna see ya, let's get in the groove
Oh you stand alone girl, you special
You the one I can't let go
And I knew from the start I love who you are

[Hook]
Baby bless your heart
Your body's a work of art
I'll take you to Mars
Come ride with a star
And I'll give it to you
Enjoy this new view
While I give it to you
Give it to you
While I give it to you
Baby this a drop
They should buy the car
I'll take you to Mars
Come ride with a star
Enjoy this new view
