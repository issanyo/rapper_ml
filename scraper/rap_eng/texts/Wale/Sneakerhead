Yea I said my shoe game cold

(Verse)
Turn up, put this nigga head yea
I bet you ain’t got these on
Uh, knee-high black socks with the white Nike check and orange and grey foams
I pull up with the cool grade 9 zone ice and I’m walkin on chrome
All the whitey blonde concords telling bonjour when I’m in my zone
Yea, south beach, Bron Brons for the weekend
White and yellow cardinals what we in
I bet they wait in line for the new C man
Certified real are the soldiers and the rappers
And I told ya when it come to shoes I’m the captain
Budrose when I met budrose
Crawfish 9’s when I’m at Pappadeaux
All pink KD’s, purple and blue, cold beef
And when I’m in the street everybody know me
I stay lookin clean in my all red elites
I said I stay lookin clean in my all red elites
Always Stan Smith’s on my feet
I’m a dog with my shoes, I don’t need no leash

(Pre-Hook x2)
Yea I said my shoe game cold
Turn over the sneakerhead
Yea, I bet you ain’t got these though
Oh oh oh

(Hook)
I got them number 9, goon blaze concorde number 3’s
Upper oh oh oh
Yea I got them 4 piece, all these
Ride round zone with the 2-3’s oh oh oh
Yea I said my shoe game cold

(Verse)
J’s and Timbs, I got money to spend
An arena’s final, good thing I’m playin to win
And my Fire’s reflected, real niggas respected
And I got me some checkers, fuck your charts, you narcoleptic
Bet yall was sleepin on em
I’m DS’in with that creesin on er
Keep 100 everyday, I keeps it least the Sunday
Stylin ho, call that K
Jordan Trae, 88
Foam game be anti-social, that mean it don’t got no date
Polo, this that purple 8
Call up amigo, got that bait
I just love to euro step
Sure I’m on my Harden, bae
Closet full, still coppin though
Like I’m in a pilot crew
Bought everything in flight club
And do it movie rapido

(Pre-Hook x2)
Yea I said my shoe game cold
Turn over the sneakerhead
Yea, I bet you ain’t got these though
Oh oh oh

(Hook)
I got them number 9, goon blaze concorde number 3’s
Upper oh oh oh
Yea I got them 4 piece, all these
Ride round zone with the 2-3’s oh oh oh
Yea I said my shoe game cold

(Verse x2)
Mack talkin, shit talkin bout
Kicks on fire, we walkin out
Nice kicks, got them nice kicks
And that sneaker freak a be ballin out

Night talk, what you talkin bout?
Kicks on fire, we walkin out
Nice kicks, got them nice kicks
And that sneaker freak a be ballin out

(Pre-Hook x2)

Oh oh oh

(Hook)
