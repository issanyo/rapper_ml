[Intro]
Cash Mohammed, McGreggor Conor, Folarin

[Verse 1]
Yeah, mind racin', negotiatin' my situation
I burned bridges I can't repair so been fly lately
I've been peddlin' rhymes so much my calves hurt
Fly pelican fly, Tony Montana work
Yeah I'm comfortable, tell my other label I love 'em
Create a record, collect a check, take my name from it
The face on that plain Jane can replace budgets
Princess cutter shoe pop singers that can't cut it
The ghostwritin',  both pockets is pulsatin'
For the reign of power I'll put you with Raina fifth season
These niggas streamin' they shit, they weak but they entertainin' Don't ever confuse being great with being famous
I'm that nigga fa'sho, I'm that nigga fa'sho
Some of the niggas was humble with me, look how they switch up
Look how they talk to you different like you ain't better than them
You niggas go up in Ellen, forget your Melanin quick
Niggas need a new legend, the people never forget
I mean a rebel that take the Devil on one-on-one
And pray alot with God, well now his confidence in a gun
I know alot of rappers who spot 'em after I take it from 'em
So whoever doubt me gone need a balcony and a jump

[Bridge]
You see this motherfuckin' face
You remember this motherfucker
But you'll never want to meet a motherfucker like me
You understand?

[Verse 2]
Mind racin', negotiatin' my situation
I'm bad business, the rap industry thinks I'm crazy
The gatekeepers, they hate me say I'm militant
Reallyâ€‹ niggas don't feel you unless you doin' that nigga shit
No Folarin, never change never give up your soul Folarin
And do your thing 'cause you givin' 'em hope Folarin
You know they say they only love you when broke or dead
But I can't count on that and I'm in my ghoster car
Nigga done wrote some bars my shit is boastful always for the culture
Got on by my lonesome, you Sofia Coppola
Y'all might be dope but you on 'cause you know somebody
Oh, yeah, my opposition ain't no competition
What you call a booth I call a kitchen, I'm fryin' different
Eyes lower than Shyne numbers but my vision God-level
'Cause I focus every four bifocals, sixteens is unmatched
Pistols in y'all hand like Brita, they untapped
Bitter niggas be reckless, they disrespectful and envious
And so you niggas is Breakfast, where Desus and Mero at?
Margiela apparel, what Virgil say he ain't sent me
This shit was a retail so don't check where my check is at
Ain't playin' with little niggas 'cause I ain't with tit for tat
But throwin' subliminals make your woman a widow fast and then I dash
Jerry Lorenzo, I'm finna blow a bag now
2007 the rappers had no swag now
All of these niggas Supreme, nothing is different with me
When I played receiver, I perfected the fly route
Highly respected, tell these labels I'm iced out
I'm feelin' like Beckham, I tell them let the price out
I'm lyrically celibate, any status y'all want
Motherfuckers ain't fuckin' with a nigga from Naija
Baba Folarin, untapped potential but still tap your woman
Okay, Baba Folarin, my side just might tax you like Mike Rotunda
Oh yeah, I never fumble
A Betty Lennox in a Bentley with the Helly on me
Bammas think I'm with the locals, come on, tell me something
Dread head get scoped and soaked until it's Shelly color
Woo! That's the MC, DMV about to peak, it ain't just me
I dare seven niggas step to me, OC
Sleep, how they peeps be awake for the whole week?
Funeral crowd, keep runnin' your mouth, nigga
The reaper within your reach, you keep reachin' for clout
Cloud of mine, I'm high, I'm tired, I'm tried
I tried, goodbye my love, the fourth time's a charm, I'm signed...
Or nah
