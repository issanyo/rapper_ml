Bring your best unit
You say you're risin' then I Lisa left you there
Primetime Deion, high steppin' he gone
Death to the A&R that let you niggas be on
Beat em 'til they scatterin'
Make em all sabbatical
Steinbrenner bread, you get CC Sabathia
Weed keep me happy but them freaks keep me happier
That's why I be with hoes between the scrotum like an abacus
The flashiest, arrogant, DC on the map again
Prada Columbian, and I talkin' travelin
Out of this galaxy, stratosphere when I appear
Then I appear I treat the beat like Rowdy Roddy Piper's gear
Killed it, revived it and rebuild it
If all these hoes is sweatin' then we prolly in the buildin'
Wassup shawty? I'm here
I'm happy you was listenin'
And all my hoes the same, everyday is Sister Sister
A young fly gigolo
Tryna' get that Jigga dough
Shawty got that fire head, Bam Bam Bigelow
Trey boutta hit a note, hit 'em with a little flow
Stockton and Malone to these hoes, that's that pick and roll
Livin' so golden, nigga so focused
Liquor so potent so we ain't even smokin'
I am the epitome of highly important
Y’all are the epitome of Ryan Leaf throwin’
Oh shit, they bitter ‘cause my whole team winnin’
Start to fly in the fog, bet they won't see a winner
A gluttonous nigga, bet you won't see your dinner
And your ho so easy all the cavemen did her
