[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
From the showroom to the runway
Make a move, take my daughter out for a sundae
The sun ray beamin' my dull life to niggas that jealous
They get no light, I piss 'em off on spite
Home base, you still runnin' from outfield
How's bein' a louse feel
I'm corporate in the house that Ralph built
How chill, shorty don't talk with your mouth filled
Your boyfriend a loser, got a couch to couch deal
Remember, that nigga still old with a pack since December
Smokers club found a president and member
If you play with your nose get high for the Kendra
Flying with the work, put the bud up in the blender
Suppress the bags, dope boy diddy bop finessed the swag
Got a knack for the biz with a great mind
Free max, Lauren got Barack on the facetime

[Hook]
Fuckin show off, Fuckin show off
Such a show off, Fuckin show off
Fuckin show off, Fuckin show off
From bein' gone even when he on we takin' no losses
Fuckin show off, Fuckin show off
Fuckin show off, Fuckin show off
Such a show off, Fuckin show off
From bein' gone even when he done we takin' no losses

[Verse 2: Wale]
Praise Allah, flip heron
Lawyers go to Synagogue or Bar Mitzvah
Flow is the number 1 I know it top lists
The A.C. on, make a door the broad lift up
Top down, what now
Middle lane shawty count a hunnid rounds
Pinnacle, doin' wild
Ya'll ain't gotta do the track do the style
I smoke until I'm dizzy, I call up DZA to get me
I'm never distant from real niggas, only digital enemies
Twitter, Twitter, you killin' me
I ain't DM-ing bitches unless she feelin' me
Yeah, cause they be out to tax
And these (?) niggas keep on falling for that
I ease back right where they found me at
I bet the box cutter shock him like the (?)
I be chillin' by the president pass
So fuck a boss; Steve Austin, boy, Mr. McMahon
I'm out in Harlem again, 100th and something
Tellin' every Spanish girl "no me llamo" forever
Pocket rocket on lil' shawty, I dare you to bet her
I dare you to book em, my bougee bitches leavin' you stuck up, yeah
What's up, show off, you such a show off
I blow hard, to blow jobs off and get a blowjob

[Hook]
Fuckin show off, Fuckin show off
Such a show off, Fuckin show off
Fuckin show off, Fuckin show off
From bein' gone even when he done we takin' no losses
Fuckin show off, Fuckin show off
Fuckin show off, Fuckin show off
Such a show off, Fuckin show off
From bein' gone even when he done we takin' no losses

[Outro: Peter Rosenberg]
I'ma have to ask ya'll a question
How many potheads we got in the house tonight
Put them hands up
This one's for you
