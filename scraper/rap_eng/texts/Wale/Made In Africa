[Intro voice 1]
Scholars and scientists now conceive that Africa is the first place of mankind
Africans were the first builders of civilization
They discovered mathematics, invented writing, developed sciences
Engineering, medicine, religion, fine arts, and built the Great Pyramids
An architectural achievement which still baffles modern scientists'

[Intro voice 2]
The 225th Emperor direct descent from Solomon and The Queen of Sheba
He is the "King of Kings, The Lion of Judah"
The name Haile Selassie I means "Power of the Trinity"

[Verse 1: Stephen Marley]
Educate yourselves, of Africa
To liberate yourself, Africa
Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry
Eeeeyh
Our history that they stole, Africa
Is written in our souls, Africa
Oldest nation on this earth
Know just what you worth
Well well
Ships that sail to distant places
Robbed us of our rights and worth
History says that you've betrayed us
Talking of the Gods you serve
Hear the rambling in the sky
Tears that our forefathers cry
And today we're still in chains
Take the shackle from our minds
You're the cornerstone
The king upon the throne
How beautiful are thou, Africa
All nation have to bow, Africa
Don't you fall from grace
You're that secret place
Aye! Aye-ah-aye!

[Verse 2: Wale]
Power to the people, Motherland representa
I'm on trial with the man she my co-defendant
And I demand her attention, can you focus women?
I'm getting closer to the sky errytime I hit it
Haile Selassie I, "Power of the Trinity"
Soul made in naija, my vice made in Italy
White mans world that I'm livin' in, some say
But it was Africa the continent we all came from
Can't nothing come between me and you
So before I have seeds gotta understand my roots
Gotta understand the truth. We is all king's 'round here
Life's not all fair, work till we fall dead
Paul goin' hard 'till I urn like a Pall-Bearer
Although my body's in the U.S my heart's there
I can never be ashamed of her
I got my features and my name from her; mama Africa

[Verse 3: Stephen Marley]
The richest place on earth
Know just what your worth

(HARMONIZING WITH MUSIC)
Talking about the God you serve
(HARMONIZING WITH MUSIC)

Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry

They infiltrate our homes, Africa
They claim it as their own, Africa
Now we must stand tall
To break down all these wall-alls
Well well

Our children must be taught, of Africa
The science and the art, Africa
Nah Nah Nah Nah Nah Nahhh!

Educate yourself, Africa
To liberate yourselves, Africa
Keep your heads up high
No more will we cry

Beautiful are thou, Africa
A legend have to bow, Africa
Oh Oh!
