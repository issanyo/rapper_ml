[Verse]
'Face said "The World is Mine" but he lied
Been trying to put it down long after I was signed
I done seen a nigga rise, watch you niggas dick ride
I done seen a nigga drop find God and skip town
Huh, and I don't rock a fake smile
The game's got cancer, I radiate the crowd
It's terminally, permanently, seriously ill
These is words you can feel if you prefer what is real
This ill right here, I represent the future
I don't get assists, I'm a stand-alone tumor
Malignant, belligerent, believe me I'm living this
Them niggas all peaked, but you ain't seen a niggas limit yet
Lean to my friendship, do as I do
That's all a nigga needs, I get through without food
Can do without you niggas, you niggas fool niggas trying to be cool
Dr. Seuss niggas, Mother Goose niggas
Little goons with a crew full of little niggas
I'm in the jungle, no Mogli and Baloo, nigga
Only a bafoon would ever think I ain't the move
My legion is doom, my gorilla's monsoon
I'm feelin on that 'rillo till I'm level with the Moon
See it's effortless, these niggas can't step up in my shoes
Why brag about the hood if we forever on the move?
A photographic memory, I'm never gonna lose
A notarized entity, both personalities
I'm bi-polar, women know a nigga ain't an enemy
You niggas is anything, my bitches get everything
Only thing omitted is a baby or a wedding ring
Fuck these niggas telling me? I fuck em and I tell em "Leave"
I be with them Jazzy hoes, Andrei Kirilenk...
Kill a beat, skin the beat; wear it till the PETA people coming up to me like I'm Kelis up in a fucking mink
See I'm fronting, get your food, keep on running
Get your broad, keep her cumming
She forget about her husband
Damn skippy, a nigga getting bitches
You can bet your bottom dollar the bottom lips will need stitches
Huh, get with us
My team getting digits
You can all get hit and we ain't lenient to women
I'm digging out divas
Ibiza to Virginia
The hot-box vehicle like breathing out the window
Cops lock me up, I get the bail from my kinfolk
Headband endo, ya'll ain't ready
I be Seth Petruzelli, and you all looking Kimbo
Hotel lobby be mobbed with the nymphos
I'm rolling a cigar, Bob Marley would endorse
My jobs quite hard but see all of its mental
Soon to smoke em by the yard till my lungs can't get through
Swear I'm trying to get through
To mash those difficult
I don't rap flipping coke, I just try to give em hope
Here it go, here it go
The outcast of Interscope
And I've been underrated
I'm just saying, I ain't bitching though
I ain't really famous but the ladies need my picture though
So my Saturday Night's Live, nigga Joe Piscopo
I love women, Air Max's and Liquor stores
And I'mma smash all three before it hits four
D.C up in the house, what it sittin' for?
Shit ain't been the same since I took a stake in the Board
I can change the whole game if a nigga bored
I can turn a studio into a fucking morgue
Fuck fame, I love my fans just a little more
So these bars not mine, nigga it's yours
Like Wu-Tang, look how I do the thing
1-900-Wale, nigga keep the change
Uhh, and I'm ill
