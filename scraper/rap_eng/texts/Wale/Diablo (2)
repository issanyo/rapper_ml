[Intro: Lil Dude]
Yeah man, yeah
Bro was like, when he tied the plug up man
Smacked his ass out and shit man, nigga was trippin' man
He don't remember nothin' he was sayin' man
Only thing he remember, he was just like
A nigga kept screamin' and screamin'
Talkin' some, "¿porque, porque?"
Haha, shit crazy man

[Chorus: Lil Dude]
We got them bags in nigga, yeah we gotta move
And bitch we got them sticks and we know just how to use 'em
My brodie he a shooter, teacher used to call him a loser
And yeah we got them Uzis, get you wet like a Jacuzzi

[Verse 1: Lil Dude]
Nigga it's not a movie, boy this shit for real
These pussy ass niggas get locked up and take a deal
Niggas not solid, man these niggas not for real
These niggas they can't hide in the fuckin' battlefield
One hand up on my drink, the other hand up on the wheel
These crackers lookin' at me like my name is Emmet Till
Bitch it's Luciano, bitch it's diablo
Hit the head honcho, watch him fall like dominos
Comin' in my barrio, you get hit with choppers bro
AR's, we got lots of those, choppers that come with the scope
These niggas do not play they role so these niggas get exposed
Ho if that's your bro, how he gon' fold?
Told my young nigga unload, stick make him lean like he on dro
Stick make him lean back, Fat Joe, it been like that from the go
I don't know who these niggas think they know
But they know in the trap I be making honor roll, Luciano

[Chorus: Lil Dude]
We got them bags in nigga, yeah we gotta move
And bitch we got them sticks and we know just how to use 'em
My brodie he a shooter, teacher used to call him a loser
And yeah we got them Uzis, get you wet like a Jacuzzi
We got them bags in nigga, yeah we gotta move
And bitch we got them sticks and we know just how to use 'em
My brodie he a shooter, teacher used to call him a loser
And yeah we got them Uzis, get you wet like a Jacuzzi

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yo, ayy look
Niggas see my name but only praise it once you say
I'm just a young nigga, my OG's owe me some favors, uh
Hope you ask your bitch, if that's your bitch, bitch who your favorite?
I bet she say Wale and then she don't ask 'cause she playin' you
Hometown been okay with that
Sneak diss, we don't play with that
Luciano got new VLONE, how you fittin' that K in that?
Riverdale, it's on everything, hundred dollars that carry out
I just came for them racks and wings
Sue Young, you can keep the change, look
Diablo, got three hoes in mi condo
They call me elegante, if rap was dope I'd be Pablo
If rap was dope you'd be nada, promise I got compadres
In the trenches with sticks, and listen, you a piñata
Folarin, I got it

[Chorus: Lil Dude]
We got them bags in nigga, yeah we gotta move
And bitch we got them sticks and we know just how to use 'em
My brodie he a shooter, teacher used to call him a loser
And yeah we got them Uzis, get you wet like a Jacuzzi
