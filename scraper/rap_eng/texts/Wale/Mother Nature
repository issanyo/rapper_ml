[Verse 1: Wale]

Love this game hate the niggas that's in it
Can't see my drive bitch I only ride tinted
Don't give them whats mine run game by the mile
Never use the word ours I'm living in the minute

Ha, and the bitches all gone
Most times when the liquor all gone
Look, by the end of this song
Make a cold heart broad whole inner parts warm

Rain down rain down
Put a g spot on a 8 cloud
Rain down rain down
Give her that D I'm outta 8 mile

Same ole same ole
New canvas she need a new stroke
New shit lotta Nuvo
Nigga we the shit no Metamucil

If she ain't showing love then she better do so
I can leave a hint but it's better you know
Ha, and its better you know
I'm trynna get you off like a fucking loophole

Ha, in your loophole though
You too damn slow let me use something else
Ha, you could use my help
You gone lose that voice when you lose that belt

[Hook: Babyface Sample]

Slow [x3]
This time make it sweet [sweet x6]
On the slow jam of love

[Background screwed voice: Do you mind if I slow it down [x3]]

Slow [x3]
This time make it sweet [sweet x6]
On the slow jam of love

[Verse 2: Wale]

Wale, look

Prada bag for my Mrs
Scholarship for my mistress
All my love to these queens in here
But not a single fuck for y'all bitches

Money is most of y'all interest
It's funny cause most of y'all ain't did shit
Lot of babies too
See ya plate full
But I don't got the steak for y'all dishes

And I love your mind and ambition
But you're loving mine I am the shit
We can leave before midnight for sure
I can you straighten you out when we twisted

Tornado tornado and I'm trynna blow your mind
Where the tornado? Don't say no
Cause, I need that one good time
Little bit of wine little bit of killer

Little white boy, Shoutout Mac Miller
A nigga don't beat I'm primo Dilla
And now I'm Jack trippin rest in peace John Ritter

My Moschino different
And I just set trends unseen on witter
If I beat it up a little bet the people next door think her team Sacramento
