[Verse 1: Sabi]
Any time the lights go off when i’m alone with you
I’ve been doing plenty things I know I shouldn’t do
La la la la la tear them down
Gimme love, gimme love, gimme love
If I take it there with you
You know we can’t be friends
Ain’t no use in meeting you, even try to pretend
Na na na na how I feel down down
Gimme love, gimme love

[Pre-Hook: Sabi]
Say you want me
Then I want you to, say you need me
Then I need you to, just come say you miss me and never call back
Where they do that at?
If you kiss me, i’mma kiss on you
Did you touch me? or did I touch you?
Just dont say you love me and never come back
Where they do that at?

[Hook: Sabi]
Where they do that at? (repeat)
Just dont say you miss me and never call back
Where they do that at?
Where they do that at? (repeat)
Just dont say you love me and never come back

[Verse 2: Wale]
Wale...they call me crazy
Hataz call me all the time, they ladies call me CRAAA-ZY
Dont aim me, dont speak to me with that reckless
My facebook been on fire tho, so my block game be on tetris
Where Thay Do That At?
I say "where ever I be"
We getting low on whoever, climbing that medical tree
Easy to get them to love you, it's hard to get them to leave
Cause if you get them to scream, they never letting you BREATHE..

[Pre-Hook: Sabi]
If you kiss me, Im a kiss on you
Did you touch me? or did I touch you?
Just dont say you miss me and never call back

[Bridge: Sabi]
You know I love them when they’re insecure type of guy
But I just wanna be loved baby, loved right

[Hook: Sabi]
