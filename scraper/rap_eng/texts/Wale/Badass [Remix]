[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I'm feeling like a man of the hour, tear down the house
Throwing this money like it's no running out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get any higher?
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
I'm feeling like the man of the hour, but give me a minute
I'll be the man of the year, before the season is finished
I'm on a hunt for that ass, Ciroc pool in your stomach
I hope you know how to swim before I drown you in money
Now girl I ain't even counting, never been into math
You got me going so broke, I think that I need a cash
Just throw it all in the air and in yo face like a mask
I got a couple freaky things I don't know if I could ask you
Now come over here and show me that you bad
Straight out detention, no pretending, I can see in yo calves
You got the strength to hold it up and donâ€™t you ever collapse
So high I think I'm about to relapse

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I'm feeling like a man of the hour, tear down the house
Throwing this money like it's no running out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get any higher?
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass

[Verse 2: Wale]
I'm the man of the hour, money and power
And the humble ain't feed me so I got that Geechi shit out me
And the city is ours, where the killers devour
Where the niggas lift Smithens and the victims lift a few flowers
Okay what I see dog you and me not cool, bet they be loud when I leave out room
Knowing how you move how you got good shoes, when the heat on niggas be like pyoom
Young nigga with some old riches
And the coldest women I be with weave on Necole Bitchie's
The broad let me I sweat it out like P90 get me doe
And I'm sure she's got them cakes but I'm trying to see that throat
35-o-o my coat, we high choking on that dope
Turn around girl let a nigga know, double M Young Olu ghost

[Chorus: Kid Ink]
I'm feeling like a man of the hour, tear down the house
Throwing this money like it's no running out
Okay, but I wanna know, can you get any higher?
And drop it down the pole like it's a fire
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I'm feeling like the man of the hour, host of the evening
These niggas is haters, they know that we eating
I got a bitch she Jamaican, fuck her slow when we speaking
I get your chick and I take her, talking Cabo for the weekend
I'm just a young nigga outchea balling, all these bad bitches calling
Rollie all flooded New Orleans and a big Rolls Royces, can't park it
I got gold rims on my Ash Martin and I'm rolling up in that foreign
I said all my bitches half foreign, you could run tell that ask Martin, hold up
I flex hard on Instagram, post your bitch going insta-ham
Pyrex pot that's insta-grams, drop that work that's insta-bands
And I'm sitting man, on a couple mill, swear my life's so fucking real
Back to the wall like fuck the world, a nigga say fuck me, I'mma fuck his girl like woah

[Outro]
Now let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
Let me see just what you're doing with your bad ass
I can't help but watch you move it with your bad ass
