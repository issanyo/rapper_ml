[Intro: Magazeen]
Ehhhhh
Maga-to-the-Zeen
Gal come wind 'pon it
Come siddung 'pon it
Gyal me know you's a freak from long time
She take two man one time
Take it here, take it anywhere, from here to Brazil

[Hook: Magazeen]
Tell mi say she want it
Now she calling
That gal want me ride har
Til the morning
She tell me say she need it
Now she calling
That gyal want mi ride har
Til the morning

[Wale]
Yeah, red bottoms, she ain't trying to dance
She gonna chauffer, after let's call a cab
Wet willy shit, pussy I need a minute
Iâ€™m tryna have them lips sync, Milli Vanilli shit
Okay I'm trying to hit, something's just gotta give
Can't read the future, my limit is so illiterate
Lyrically celibate, they can't fuck with me
Y'all crazy, this ain't the same cut with me
Low fitted, sure I'm with it
Polo purple like the dope I'm hitting
Word, one dope ass nigga
Bitches scream "Ralph" they don't know Mike Bivins
As far as these bars, my flow life sentence
And I be in they panties if they be independent
I be in her mind, and y'all be "nevermind"
My marijuana loud, I swear they never mind ?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Black Cobain]
Clicquot for the girls in the tight dress
Dutty wine for access, show me your neck
I feel good, I look great
A nigga cold, I'm New York, I'm upstate
Lord, I think I'm Ted DiBiase
I had a million dollar dream, who gon' stop me?
And be a freak, for me, Slink, and Lil J
When I step off the curb, then, they on they way
Dreads like Rapunzel, big bread, cocoa
Give me the poon, have you shoppin out SoHo
And bring a friend, we can kick it like a Dojo
Let's see what happen, you mixed Trone with Nuvo
Forreal, I got a pole in the basement
My raincoat, and gold wrappers, amen
And what it taste like? Hey, you a freak, right?
No strings attached like velcro sneaks, iight?

[Hook]

[Bridge: Magazeen]
Alright then, back up on it
Might win a dollar
Sit up on it
Might wina dollar
Excuse me ?
Your eyes are amazing
?

Alright then, back up p'won it
Whine for meh gyal
Sit up p'won, whine for meh gyal
Excuse me behavior
Your eyes my nature
Divide your legs
Let me get in at the centre

[Outro: Magazeen]
Stop whining, stop whining, stop whining
By God, stop whining
Slow, slow, slow, slow grind
By God, slow grind
Speed it, speed it, speed it
Speed it up, my girl, speed it up
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock
Tick tock, darling, tick tock
Tree pine, tree pine, tree pine
Tree pine, now, do the tree pine
Jump shot, jump shot, jump shot
Now, jump shot

Start whine (start whine) start whine (start whine)
Start whine, my gyal, start whine
Slow whine (slow whine) slow whine (slow whine)
Slow whine, my gyal, slow whine
Speed it up (speed it up) speed it up (speed it up)
Speed it up, my girl, speed it up
Tick tock (tick tock) tick tock (tick tock)
Tick tock, gyal you got it like dat, eh!
Tree pine (tree pine) tree pine (tree pine)
Tree pine now, do the tree pine
Jump shot (jump shot) jump shot (jump shot)
Jump shot, my gyal, jump shot, eh!
Blood clot
