[Intro]
We just tryna be
Like the niggas that came before us you know
Hear us out

Mr. underdog
They don't hear my bark
Want the title but im always fighting under card
Mr. underrated, tryna make it, yeah im tryna tell 'em
I ain't tryna be no

[Verse 1]
And I be feeling like Hova when y'all was sleeping on him
So called music enthusiasts ain't even know it
I ain't being facetious saying I speak for the culture
I just see through to my roots like I'm greasing with sulfur
Without no Reasonable Doubt y'all was all on the sofa
By 2004, jerseys was out your wardrobe
When I read what I wrote feel like I reached out a holster
I'm just aiming what I'm saying hope you bleed out emotion
I ain't saying I don't fuck with all these other niggas
I'm just saying im above all these other niggas
Fake hugs from all these fuck niggas
No love for all these sucka niggas
Feeling like Shawn Carter before the diamond
You know that sort of rhyming was sort of head of its timing
I got that same hunger, Rock-a-fella chain hunger
That going through some things
Cause they don't hear the shit im saying hunger

[Hook]
Mr. underdog
They don't hear the bark
I want that title but they got me fighting under card
Nigga just underrated, hustling just tryna make it
Fuck what them niggas saying I aspire for greatness
Mr. underdog and this is not a bark
Under ya nose a rose grew with no sun at all
I ain't stunting y'all
Tell them niggas they sleeping
Tell them niggas they slipping
Tell them niggas that we up

[Verse 2]
Feeling like Rosé before Jay
The marathon of this game always changes in pace
Now they mention my nigga with all the greats
And guess who my nigga tell 'em is on the way
You in debt to the game success is expected
Fucking with ricky got me working relentless in sessions
Work ethic respected by several record executives
Well dressed im not the type that gets reckless with nothingness
Underrated overdressed well paid no vistech
I’m a top tier nigga looking for respect
There was a time when they hated all the southern rappers
Now all them rappers looking for southern to rap on
I be liking this mula, its gone talk if you have it
By the looks of your balance you acting like Charlie Chaplin
Passion in rapping a blessing to even see this
Some of my equals didn't see past their rookie season

[Hook]

[Bridge (2X)]
I ain't saying I don't fuck with all these other niggas
I'm just saying im above all these other niggas
Fake hugs from all them fuck niggas
No love for them sucka niggas

[Hook]
