[Verse 1]
Ayo I’m goin' places, Dior Homme lacin' all occasions
And Lord gave me amazing thinking and short patience
Lay solo, forever flashy though I hate photos
Date four hoes, make her smile and make her moan though
Lady charmer, put armor by your baby mama
I hate to say it a later moment I didn’t warn ya
High roller, big spender
And my intentions to keep her on the sack, you just Saks Fifth her
I’m that different, this cat can react mad pimpish
I gathered a couple hundred thousand, I can’t remember
They keep talkin' and we keep winning
Why niggas never say capisce until police chalk em
Because of my bitch that's talkin', givin' her head, the streets will follow
I come from a place where niggas my age ain't placed to see tomorrow
To each his own but each of them is known to steal or rob you
But jails are overpopulated but know there's seats in college
And those are the least of problems, I speak to God he says I'm alright
My vision funny, though 20/20's my hindsight
Bad bitches with me, real niggas with me
Whole ghetto with me mixin Ketel with the Simply
Like the sweet anguish, find your peace baby
I know the millions you get come with a billion haters, yea

[Chorus]
Forgive me, I’m a rider
Sure I’m just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd
You know that I’m a rider
Tell 'em just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd

[Verse 2]
I’m pickin' apart, my wicked opponents
Get in my zone
Niggas can't join us, so, these niggas done cloned us
Look at me close, see the results you see a nigga a loner
Cause all of the bitches that's giving me grief also be given me boners
Blow up in rap, young and you black
Niggas be blowin' your phone up
Whenever you don’t, lose you a homie, ho
Adult from show cuz
If you get that, then roll up
If you get that, that’s no love
Every move you make they got lip
Every chick you like done got kids
And forget that chick had brought friends
Every jay you hit you need vent
Every friend you got, got M.O's
I’m in a game, even with a deep bench
I'mma ball like small fro Kobe
Without the 8, but all the hate though
Pockets thicker all my niggas, ain't the same though
I just came up, fuck is you sayin' though
Gave the business my heart, it just gave me the finger
Nigga, yeah

[Chorus]
Forgive me, I’m a rider
Sure I’m just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd
You know that I’m a rider
Tell 'em just a simple man
All I want is money, fuck the fame
I’m a simple man, lawd
