[Intro: Kevin Cossom]
MM-MMMM-MMM Maybach Music...
Girl, what you grabbing cash for?
All you need is your passport...

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
What you know about this life (.. yeah, yeah)
Just relax baby get high (yeah)
You're on your way to the best night ever
No top on the car (no top, no top)
We're out with the stars (yeah)
You're on your way to the best night ever
Bitch, don't, mess, this, up, for, yourself

[Verse 1: Wale]
Uhh... yeah, uhh
Forgetting time, spending several minutes in her eyes
When in her mind it be feeling different in her thighs
It's ill-advised giving hours to another broad
'Cause what is love if you ain't discover love at heart
A nigga thorough, she knew it before I bought her car
She pretty but she insecure as baby-mother scars
Everything got a flaw, we desire perfection
Body bad as hell, her vagina is heaven
And her mind is amazing, different kind of connection
Love is for optimistics, don't you try and convince me
And her body is steaming, how I need it revealing
Not a product on the market that can offer this feeling
It's so hard for civilians, thank God you with a boss
You found a prince without losing slippers or kissing frogs
Don't get too far, just play your part, I'll break you off
And one day you'll get my all, it's Insha'Allah.. Wale

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
What you know about this life (.. yeah, yeah)
Just relax baby get high (yeah)
You're on your way to the best night ever
No top on the car (no top, no top)
We're out with the stars (yeah)
You're on your way to the best night ever
Bitch, don't, mess, this, up, for, yourself

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
Ugh, open your eyes wide riding in the Rolls Royce
Keep your mouth close, you fucking with a dope boy
Everybody watching while you touching real money
I'm only rocking with the niggas that'll kill for me
My hood bitches even got them rocking heels for me
All the jewels on, got about a mil on me
They the strippers but the bitches want to feel on me
Third bottle, feeling like they slipped the pill on me
These niggas snitching, catch a case and cut a deal on me
So fuck a song, writing poems for the real homies
One life to live but they all doing life bids
Everybody coming home deserve a white Benz
Hoes gossip while the real niggas on the grind
Gucci rocking his gold Rollie, I'm rocking mine
Baby told me that she never memorized a verse
Until the day I put 100K inside her purse

[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
What you know about this life (.. yeah, yeah)
Just relax baby get high (yeah)
You're on your way to the best night ever
No top on the car (no top, no top)
We're out with the stars (yeah)
You're on your way to the best night ever
Bitch, don't, mess, this, up, for, yourself
