Wale

[Hook: Drake's Say Something]

I got the [?] with me
My Outchea family
YBM

[Verse 1: Wale]
Yeah
And i guess things change
Its funny how these niggas always gotta say my name
Tattooed on their brain
For my failure they will pray
So my eyebrow is raised for every handshake exchanged
Its not a game for every nigga that I know
There is a million fake of em and all of them is close
God keep me on my focus while I'm driving on this course
Loyalty from my niggas and a broad that can contort
I was taught to never listen
Don't love em, never kiss em
I pray my main misses never fucks my opposition
Folarin, [?] if we partners
And now your bitch is missing like my disc up in Target
I spit my shit retarded
And with this pen I'm polished
Love my bitches understated, no sea biscuit on their noggin
My lyrics why they talking
My women never borrow
And this beat is Maury povich, I am all you niggas' father
No DNA can offer, defeat me thats preposterous
I'm glad I'm not no dealer cuz these streets is like an opera
Deceitful people talk as if police is not the problem
Police gonna get to probing start interrogating talking like
Say something baby, say say something baby
Well I am as loyal as they come, Desert Storm could include me
Your list is unimportant if yours don't include me
Lord knows I try but its a poor nigga truthfully
I'm underrated, feel like I never made it
I be like Bill Gates [?] if I had a dollar for every hater
They some D-leaguers talking like some Lakers
There speech is never needed like [?] makeup
Somehow I got my weight up, somehow I found my way out
Black bitches wanna date me, white bitches wanna make out
The tour bus where they stake out
I call em hoes to take out
1 at 7, 1 at 9, they keep each other ate out (ha ha)
She's the royal and you the fool
There is a code they created, you think that shit is cool
They holding out on pussy while you try to make a move
They make you kneel before you score, Maurice Jones Drew
I never trusted Del Rio
And Imma break the heart of every broad with a ego
And Imma uplift every queen with some sense
And every nigga with no game shall remain on the bench
The whole city on that rapping shit
So you can have it all, in a minute I'll be out of it
I just need a woman thats intelligent as passionate
And cook without asking, I ain't hassling for halibut
Wrassling is rapping now
Ain't nobody clapping now
I trade this microphone for some papers and a cap n gown
Cheers from the crowd for a nigga they care about
I keep my women fly, Amelia Earhart
Don't mouth my position [?], don't speak of my whereabouts
I won't stand for it, do I look I'm gearhart[?]?
And this ain't even a fair spar
Cuz in my city I'm the like the part where your hair starts
They root for me, I am dope I am tough
So play your part like Isoplus with this fighting stuff
