[Intro:wale]
I just wanted to be heard
I just wanted to be on
Thats what we call it when you get a record deal
And get in front of the camera we call that being on
Thats all i wanted to get on
Whatever you on alright
Little homie everybody's looking at you now what
You got money now uh success and more money
I dont look at it like that
Like a lot of rappers saying money(x3)
Like thats to buy jewlery and impress people
Mines is self worth now
Not to say im not worth anything without it
But its just like competitive nature
Like if we playing 5 on 5
I want more points than (?)

[Hook:lightshow]

(Lightshow)
Why be nervous

Why be nervous

Streets no longer need they service
Why be nervous
Why be nervous
Nigga i go hard
Leave the rest up to god
