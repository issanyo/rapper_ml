And a hundred for your smile, I'mma be here for a while
I'mma be up with them owls, just to see you when you out
Look, stuntin' for the fuck of it, I ain't with the sucka' shit
All the bad strippers gotta greet me with the government
Fuck whoever judge ya, and trick whoever love ya
But don't expect a ring if you committed to the hustle

Cause my bitch look like she said hurry up and bye

[Verse 6: T.I.]

Pink toenails tail like a beached whale
Tell em all better keep it on the DL
No phone, no Twitter, no email
Diamonds in the chain, none in the rear
Following the king of diamonds, bitch you went ape shit
Pocket racked up all big faces
After party crib full of broads all naked
Rose cases, we pop daily
We stay faded, need no occasion
Latin and Asians, Black, Caucasian
All go crazy for days in amazement
