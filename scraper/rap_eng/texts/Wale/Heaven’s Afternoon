[Intro: Wale]
In the grand scheme of things
We never was supposed to have shit
Born to lose, built to win
Folarin, let's get it in

[Hook: Wale]
Look, we ain't 'posed to never have nothing
We ain't 'posed to never have shit
See the growth in my rhymes and
You see my focus ain't on them
Nah, at the top, it's just us, huh
Let's get it, okay

[Verse 1: Wale]
PRPs or some dunks you ain't know 'em
Givenchy, but no kilt, mi amor
We can't leave for we love the allure
Hold mine down and stay above what you on
On, I'm appeased and obliged
Scorpio freaks quantity Gemini
Woo! I'mma need me a light
Ridin' through the cap, Cap' STEEZ on the mind
Though, I ain't know him but I wish I did
Each one, teach one, may the youth live
On that, Joey Bad please hold your head
Lost one last summer, livin' ain't fair
While them niggas scared, we forever here
Hate to see you smile, money everywhere
Dream killers out, I see them in the rear
Before I put them in a song, put them in a prayer
Amen

[Hook: Wale]
Cause we ain't 'posed to never have shit
Yeah, we ain't 'posed to never (we ain't 'posed to never)
Nah, we ain't 'posed to never have nothin'
We ain't 'posed to never have shit
You see the growth in my rhymes and
You see my focus ain't on them

[Post-Hook: Stokley Williams]
I was 'posed to have nothing (no-ohh-whoa)
Said I was 'posed to have nothing (no-ohh-whoa)
Said I was 'posed to have nothing (no-ohh-whoa)
Said I was 'posed to have nothing (no-ohh-whoa)

[Verse 2: Wale]
Look, look, look
Yeah, I'm focused, it's Folarin here
I reckon your barbershop talk of this
Heavenly Father, may the spirit of God
Help whoever at odds get your guidance, quick
All we need is Keisha, all we need is Becky
All we need is God, and fed free fetti
My little buddy livestrong, young nigga peddle
He ain't make it in the leagues so the streets wet him
Gettin' wet up on the corner in whatever weather
Before see the jail again, he gonna see the devil
Rah! Been a week since he seen his mother
Uh, and 18 since he seen the other
I'mma pray for him
It's safe to say he got some pain within
It ain't too much that I can say to him
Cause my bank statement don't relate to him
Look, Ralph

[Hook: Wale]
We ain't never posed to never have nothin'
Yessir, that's right, cause we ain't posed to never have shit
Nope, no, we ain't never posed to never have nothin'
Yeah, you see my focus ain't on them

[Verse 3: Meek Mill & Wale]
I was so fresh, so clean when I stepped on that scene
Pulled up Aston Martin, you could ask them ya'll seen
When I came through this bitch paper tagging on lean
Baddest bitch in the game, nigga that was ya'll dream
Hold up, let me get a feel like Jackson
Hold up, I don't feel these niggas (nah)
Hey Wallace (Yep, what's the problem?)
I'm focused, I'm Kobe, I kill these niggas
Hah, I ain't scared of these niggas
Getting higher than Shaquille O'Neal's field goal percentage
Yeah me nigga, tell the brokest nigga with me
Got a mil plus interest, Meek keep living, get em
When I was dead broke
Used to always tell myself I'mma still be the shit
Told my P.O., she locked me up
I'mma do the time, come home and still be this rich
Still see the bricks, I'mma still be a Mitch
Got these Rico niggas tryna kill me and shit
Hol' up, tryna kill me and shit
Let me get the flow back, I was killing this shit
We was killing them strips
Dropheads, no ceilings and shit
Ain't talking 'bout Wayne, bitch I'm talking them things
300 in chains, got a million in whips
Nigga, ho!

[Hook: Wale]
We ain't 'posed to never have nothin'
That's right, cause we ain't 'posed to never have shit
Nope, no, we ain't 'posed to never have nothin'
You see my focus ain't on them

[Post-Hook: Stokley Williams]
I was 'posed to have nothing (no-ohh-whoa)
Said I was 'posed to have nothing (no-ohh-whoa)
Said I was 'posed to have nothing (no-ohh-whoa)
Said I was 'posed to have nothing (no-ohh-whoa)
No-ohh-whoa, no-ohh-whoa
No-ohh-whoa

[Outro: Wale]
Yeah, uh, started from the bottom nigga
Yeah, but now we grinding till the law come get us
Yeah, for the money and them commas nigga
Yeah, but can't forget about vagina nigga
Yeah, started from that bottom nigga
Yeah, but now I got it it's a problem nigga
Yeah, bor that money and them dollars nigga
Yeah, and I ainâ€™t rich but I'm still shining nigga (church!)
