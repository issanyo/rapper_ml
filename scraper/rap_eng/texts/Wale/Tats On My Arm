[Intro: Rick Ross]
Ambition is a way of life
It's a mindset
Follow me

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Wale]
Tats all on my arm, bitch all on my mind
I got stacks all in my charm
My gold Rollie tell time
It's my ambition, nigga
It's my ambition, nigga
I'm just so gifted
Look where that shit get ya
Okay, tats all on my arm, these dreads all in my eyes
I put these poems all in these songs
For that paper, I'mma grind
That's my ambition, nigga
That's my ambition, nigga
That's my ambition, nigga
It's my ambition

[Verse 1: Wale]
I ain't with the talking
See, I'm just trying to focus
Cause the loudest nigga in the room is usually the brokest
Tryna stay clear of my foes
And these shape-shifting hoes
Y'all can't stick to no G code
See them snakes show when you mow
Get my taste from all of my bitches
My mates calling me gifted
February cold as my heart
That's why your date is probably missin'
'Le Folarin be trippin'
Man I take cigars, start fillin'
I got a green bag with them blue strands
Man I smoke that Marjorie Simpson
Got a broken heart that needs fixin'
And I don't rely on no bitches
And I don't reply to most BBMs
So when you see an "R", don't be trippin!
MMG obviously winning
Nigga talk, but shorty we live it
And I swear, my Lord, I been down to earth
But most times I'm not, I be lifted

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Wale]
Tats all on my arm, bitch all on my mind
I got stacks all in my charm
My gold Rollie tell time
It's my ambition, nigga
It's my ambition, nigga
I'm just so gifted
Look where that shit get ya
Okay, tats all on my arm, these dreads all in my eyes
I put these poems all in these songs
For that paper, I'mma grind
That's my ambition, nigga
That's my ambition, nigga
That's my ambition, nigga
It's my ambition

[Verse 2: Wale]
I ain't with the rappin'
I'm just trying to focus
Cause the loudest nigga in the room is usually the brokest
Tats all on my arm, these hoes say I'm that bomb
Three J's took me this high
6 O's pay for my car
3M's on my New Balance
I'm here to shine when I'm tracking
What you doing when Ross drop a hundred thousand
And you know you supposed to be stacking!
I should Michael Jordan these rappers
Man I'm twice as cold as these rappers (Haha, hold up)
Let me wipe my nose with these rappers
And I like the hoes that need passion
And I like my girls with ambition
See money talk and these days
You thought that shorty wasn't listening?
You ain't dreaming dog, you ain't living
Even when I'm sleep, I got vision
Even when y'all deep, y'all still all sweet
I don't fiend for beef: I eat bitches

[Chorus: Rick Ross & Wale]
Tats all on my arm, bitch all on my mind
I got stacks all in my charm
My gold Rollie tell time
It's my ambition, nigga
It's my ambition, nigga
I'm just so gifted
Look where that shit get ya
Okay, tats all on my arm, these dreads all in my eyes
I put these poems all in these songs
For that paper, I'mma grind
That's my ambition, nigga
That's my ambition, nigga
That's my ambition, nigga
It's my ambition
