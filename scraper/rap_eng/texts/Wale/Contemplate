[Verse 1: Wale]
Dear sweetheart, wassup boo
Whatchu up to, more club moves
I call her, no answer; her phone in the bag, she dancin'
It's four now, the clubs over; I call her, but oh hold up
Y'all know what, ignore button; or the phone die, let's hope for it
That Damier bag I bought her
Caught the attention of those niggas on it
That cell phone that I bought is probably filled with some other niggas numbers
So it leaves me to wonder, why do I still promise to love her
Cut me off every time I'm talkin'
Which means she ain't never hear nothing
I say stay, she wanna leave
She get her point across so I gotta let her be
I'ma let her be by herself in peace
But five years from now I bet she see
When the club gets played
The things you crave are no longer escapes
And no longing for dates
You want a husband, but no one has a cape
Now you wonder and wait, and I ain't tryin' to hear what you want me to say
It feels good to be over you, babe
So play this shit while you contemplate, contemplate, contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate
Play this shit while you contemplate

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Who am I living for, is this my limit
Can I endure some more
Chances are giving, questions existing
Who am I living for, is this my limit
Can I endure some more
Chances are giving
Questions existing

[Verse 2: Wale]
Them people, they talkin'; them lights, they on me
This life I chose, but I ain't know, till I found it
To be honest, I'm modest; one hater for every nigga on it
One day everybody is applaudin' the next day you is everybody target
Why bother, why talk to 'em, where God at, I need to call Him
My knees on the ground, dear Father: don't let me break, please make me stronger
How much longer, will it linger
Well my heart is giving, will they believe it
When my song is over will they need me
Watch how quickly they find a new leader
Questioning the whole meaning
In the Viper Room, just me and River Phoenix
With Courtney Love in Lake Washington
With a note there and I'm thinking of reading
This ain't hard, Chris Benoit
Heath Ledger said the nights gon' be dark
Feel the size of a Phyllis Hyman note
Apollo Theater I just might not go
Franky Lymon, the limelight gets old
Cold so in a while I'm schizo
I can't cope, I can't think; I can't breathe, this ain't me
This ain't easy, I'm thinking; am I doing this for them or me
I can't think, am I doing this for them or me

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Who am I living for, is this my limit
Can I endure some more
Chances are giving, questions existing
Who am I living for, is this my limit
Can I endure some more
Chances are giving
Questions existing
