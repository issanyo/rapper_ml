Na Na Na Na... Na Na Na Na... Hey Hey Hey... Goodbyeeeeee... Hey!
[Lady GaGa:]
Lookin at, lookin at, lookin at me
Look at that, look at how they lookin at me
Eyes all sticky like honey on bees
Look at that, look at how they lookin at me
[Wale:]
Yeah DC chillin, PG chillin
My name WALE and I came to get It
Came to get it, came to get it
My name Wale

[Verse 1: Wale]
SHIIIT This how you start of 09
Kickin in the door, and I'm everybody problem
Stuntin in some other Jordan Nines
I got Phil Knight talkin about "How you got them? "
Let's talk about the cars ya'll got
You say you got alotta whips, well I got a Lot
I got the right to be cocky
Get so much cut disc jockeys jock me
You niggas mad that you not me
I remain a Giant and your Jeremy Shockey
And if you ain't heard me properly
If you speak garbage, then we no capice
DC chillin, PG chillin, floor to the ceilin
Stuntin in my Billion-Aire, gear on my
Millionaire Frames, that's money on my mind, WALE

[Bridge: Lady GaGa]
Get em all, get em all, pack it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks
Across the pond, they all know us
International... Whoaaaa!
Driving my car to a foreign place
Lookin at me, now they know my face
We want it all now, we got all YESSSS
Look At That, Look at how they lookin at usss

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yea, they keep sayin whale but my name Wal-e
Ho's call me "Mr. Never Wear The Same Thang"
You redundant, you never ever change
And I'm the same way, M.I.A
And me Cool and Dre get high like planes
Your man Wale in his own damn lane
Can't control the box, you are no Mills Lane
Ain't heard DC since Sardines came
Ha! And I made ya'll love it
We don't cop plea's, but ya'll don't cop nothin
Police come around don't nobody say nothin
And you be with the cops, you niggas is McLovin
Dark liquor till we busted
Till I got a buzz like that nigga Chris Mullen
District Of Columbia
You Bernie Mac funny, we ain't scared of none of ya!
[Lady GaGa:]
Get em all, get em all, pack it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks
Across the pond, they all know us
International... Whoaaaa!
Driving my car to a foreign place
Lookin at me, now they know my face
We want it all now, we got all YESSSS
Look At That, Look at how they lookin at usss
[Wale:]
Yeah DC chillin, PG chillin
My name WALE and I came to get It
Came to get it, Came to get It
My name Wale

[Verse 3:]
Dre, pick 'em, ah, pick'em, I'll shut em all down
Haters in the crowd, if you see 'em point them out
Stacks in my jeans, broads on the scene
Folarin be ballin for all ya'll to see
Ain't I something? The way I'm stuntin
My material girls give 'em A-Rod moneyyy!
LV on my luggage
Them Bammas goin hate, and I love it, fuck 'em
[Lady GaGa:]
Lookin at, lookin at, Lookin at me
Look at that, look at how they lookin at me
Eyes all sticky like honey on bees
Look at that, look at how they lookin at me
[Wale:]
DC chillin, PG chillin
My name WALE and I came to get It
Came to get it, came to get It
My name Wale...
