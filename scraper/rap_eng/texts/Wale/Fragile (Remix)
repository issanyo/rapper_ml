[Intro - Wale]
I'm just saying Ms. Michelle
I like you like a lil bit
And I understand you might have some insecurities and whatever but
Tell me when that junk drop

[Verse 1 - Wale]
She wanna be in love, I ain't ready tho, here it go
I can fly with you but my luggage quite heavy do
My baby mama love me but I'm done and I don't wanna
But understand insecurities in any woman
If I love you on that level, I'm a love you there forever
Your husband, your brother, confidant or whatever
It's whatever to whenever
You my angel here's your halo
No committment, scare a brotha, so don't ask don't say no
Don't push a brotha away tho
Your heart's on your sleeve shawty I could be your tailor
Defense mechanism is the attitude with her
Her outershell is difficult
Without it she is brittle
Fragile alittle bit, I can tell you diggin me
Fragile you are, I could break you off literally
Shawty this is quite interesting
Before you get ahead of yourself I'll be the [?]
Wale

[Hook]
Don't leave (Don't leave me)
Out on a limb (Out on a limb)
Can't you see me (Can't you see me)
Here on the edge (Here on the edge)
Boy don't tell me no
Don't tell me no
Whoo My heart is fragile
Lalalalalala fragile (fragile)
Lalalalalala fragile (fragile)
Lalalalalala fragile (fragile)
Lalalalalala fragile (fragile)
Boy don't tell me no, don't tell me no
Whoo my heart is fragile

I ain't begging, that ain't never been my style
Something's different, when I'm looking in your eyes
I lose, lose my cool baby, the closer that you get to meee ohhhhh

I can't take another second
Oh I'm jumping out my skin
If loving is the game then boy
You gotta let me win

Ooohhhh baby baby baby
It's like I can barely breathe

Nonononononononono

Don't leave (don't leave me)
Out on a limb (Out on a limb)

I ain't like this normally
I'm acting kinda foolishly
But dont you think, that you and me could really be

Don't leave (don't leave me)
Out on a limb (Out on a limb)
