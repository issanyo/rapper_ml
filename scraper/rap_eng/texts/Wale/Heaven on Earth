[Intro: Wale & Chris Brown]
Come fly with me, yeah
You're the one I been waitin' for
This is all I got, girl, I saved it all for you
Usin' real emotions you can't ignore
That you've been havin' all night

[Verse 1: Wale & Chris Brown]
Yeah, pour some Patron, have a cup with me
Come by the crib, keep me company
Don't worry 'bout bitches who buggin' me
Girl, if you fuck with me, just come and fuck with me (goddamn)
I can put it on you, I just need me a change
Goddamn, must got mirrors on you, I see me in the plans
Fuck the club, girl, I've been ready to go
Got the Uber waitin', we can head to the door
Yeah, Four Seasons or a room at The Ritz
I'ma show you this is as real as it gets
Take me out the game, you might even do it (Yeah, we gon' see, right)
Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo and Louis
It's on me

[Chorus: Chris Brown &  Wale]
You'd be my heaven on Earth
My love, my forever, my first
I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it
I swear you're my gift and my curse, oh
You'd be my heaven on Earth (my heaven on Earth)
My love, my forever, my first, oh
I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it
I swear you're my gift and my curse (yeah, gift and my curse)
Fly with me

[Verse 2: Wale]
If heaven had a height, she would be that tall (mmm)
Exceed that far, you see my scars (mmm)
I see your flaws, I see no problem
I know we're not gods, so we all got 'em
She a introvert, still good in public
I'm not a socialite, so sure she love it
I would tell you more, no lyin' or nothin'
Maybe I like to pick fights just to write about 'em (mmm)
Maybe you right, you a good muse
Lemme right a couple wrongs, couple hooks, boo
No Postmates, ayy, 'cause that gon' make me wait
I just go below your waist for the good food

[Bridge: Wale]
With me, yeah
And with you I'm tryna be, wait
So I'm at your door again
And it's just past 4 AM
And I hope you phone ain't ringin' (haha)
So when love's in your reach
To hold, share, and keep (Wale)
And the moon is in the sky
And it's cool 'cause she can fly
So pull up on me, pull up on me
And keep doin' your thing

[Chorus: Chris Brown &  Wale]
You'd be my heaven on Earth
My love, my forever, my first
I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it
I swear you're my gift and my curse, oh
You'd be my heaven on Earth (my heaven on Earth)
My love, my forever, my first, oh
I know you're not perfect, but girl, you're still worth it
I swear you're my gift and my curse (gift and my curse)

[Outro: Chris Brown]
You'd be my heaven on Earth
My love, my forever, my first, oh
You'd be my heaven on Earth
I swear you're my gift and my curse
