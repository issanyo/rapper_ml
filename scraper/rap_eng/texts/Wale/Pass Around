[Verse 1: Young Scooter]
From Mexico City, we pass around plugs
Young Scooter and Big Bank, they passing out drugs (yeah)
Ridin' past the police, middle fingers up (fuck 'em)
I'm quarter back passin', only difference I'm throwin' drugs (touch down)
Gucci passed me a plug, I passed his ass to Sonny
He wanna cut me off, Cuz I keep fuckin' up the money (the money)
I passed him a lick, so I get half of the money
Magic City money, Scooter passin' out hundreds
We passin' out pints, Free Decatur Ice
We passin' niggas hoes around, everyday day and night (everyday day and night)
Pass through security, no ID's I'm on the flights
Leanin' like a fool, geeked up off that dirty sprite

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Pass around bitches, pass around triggers, pass around a nigga
Cuz I don't fuck with niggas
I might pass around yo sister, ol' hatin' ass nigga
These hoes passin out patron, I drink lean not liquor
I'm not a Ciroc boy, I'm a double block boy
And it's pimps ahoy, not chips ahoy, and I'm a Block Boy
I'mma pull up to the plane in my drop top toy
We might pass you on the highway, you don't want it with ya boy
Snatch yo girl, now she's Georgia's most wanted with ya boy
Put them goons on ya, think yo house was haunted by ya boy
Sticks and stones can't break her bones, but these sticks will cut ya ass off
When they brought the news to yo baby mama, man she passed out!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
We gon' pass around rola, and I pass around loud
And I'm thoroughly respected, you can ask around town
Sippin' on brown, (work)
Puttin' my shit down
Y'all ain't fly, might as well drown
Y'all act drive like an impound (verrummm)
But already though
All my shows ready to go
All my soldiers trained to go
Album and my chain is gold
You don't want it
Me and Guwop
Cold stuntin'
Whole summer
Whole town
Ho we Third in goal runnin'
I'mma pass around lean
My Houston bitch gon'
Call me, passed her off to Andre
Never gave a shit
Not like Andre and Big Boi
But like Outkast give her a good bone
Woo! Good God passin' around gift, passin' around
Flow (work)
