[Verse 1 : Skeme]
Let me hit some
And yeah she got a mack but he don’t trip nah
Wait, white skin ass thick hah?
You ain’t had a real nigga better get one
What?
She look like it might cost
But I don’t buy a pussy so she take the night off hah?
Straight drop, lights on lights off
I get up then get in it and she ride til it’s soft aye
Bitch bad but her credit good
She with a nigga that be straight in each and every hood
And if the pussy fire put it on the wood
Sittin pretty but that kush she be smoking good

[Hook]
If I fuck I go deep
She pop pills, don’t get no sleep
Nigga we faded, OD
All these bitches know me
All these bitches know me
All these bitches know me
Nigga we faded, OD
All these bitches know me

[Verse 2 : IamSu!]
Straight drop like long hands
Met her in LA on Rose Crems
FO like a sole man
When my niggas scream I’m bout to go in
All black coupe, nigga no tints
Rolex 2 tone shit, hit for bowflex
Don’t stop, no I don’t quit, I’mma go get
More chips, focus, no I won’t slip
Broke bitch, I ain’t got no time for that
Niggas hatin', they gon' die for that
I be livin with the realest, trillest heartbreakers in the building
Kill it every day


[Hook]


[Verse 3 : Problem]
All these bitches know me
All these bitches know me
If your bitch come through to kick it

Cause she ready for a real fuck, a really thug
Yeah she tryna bust a real nut, fuck a real nut like what?
Then I get drunk then I might nut in that pussy like
Oops, my bad
Motherfucker I’m full
Livin' life like it’s no rules
Still standin' on my toes like I don’t wear shoes
Ill game gon be, I don’t cruze

[Hook]
