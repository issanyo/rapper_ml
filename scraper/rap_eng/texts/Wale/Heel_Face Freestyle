[Intro]
Woah, yo
Fuck them niggas who hate, yea
Now we soundin' sweet, go!
(Sample: "Too sweeeeeeeet!")

[Hook]
Fuck them niggas who hate, duck them bitches who fake
Everybody is real and everybody two-faced
Heel, face, heel, face, heel, wait
Fuck them niggas who hate, duck them bitches who fake
You could be an earthquake or be a snake
Heel, face, heel, let's get it
Fuck with me

[Verse]
Fuck them bitches who fake, all my shit on my plate
Got me under a fake one like you're Donald's toup√©
No real knowledge on foreign policy, obviously bait
But it's obvious broken promises shall be your fate
I'm like the coldest, the dopest poet
No bullshit, I'm so devoted
I got at like 40 bitches, but I always go with Chloe
My baby mama, G, my baby mama, G
Label took like 40 hours for no MED's
And, pick up the Maybach
I put these niggas in pieces, I duck shit
And watch these niggas walk in feces on features
See, the problem is
They're Malcolm Jamal Warner, I'm Malcolm X
Compare, yea, realest nigga everywhere
Keep my peeps in Christian and they never gon' loose their Edge
Fuck it though, we like, fuck it though
Me and Sean, Big Puffy though
He been on for a minute now
But when him around I'ma double up
Dropped one, hit a number one
Fuck you niggas, I'm goin' number one
Fuck you niggas, I'm Curt Hennig
Y'all niggas lookin' like bubble gum
Real shooter, Prince Balor
Real shooter, Prince Devitt
Only Buddha, no Len Bias
Nobody try us, we're too excellent
The execution here too special
Bless the booth, what I do special
You're a main event? I'm a main event
What I do? Pay-per-view special
You sleep on Folarin still?
I'm peepin' on you artists still
MMG still the hottest deal
Like Ric, Tully, and Arn still
I'm on my Ric Flair
Hit your head, infared weapon, no sixes
I'm on my Nature Boy
Niggas try to fuck up my money
Still leave with the gold

[Hook]
Fuck them niggas who hate, fuck them bitches who fake
You could be an earthquake or be a snake
Heel, face, heel, face, heel, yea
Fuck them niggas who hate, fuck them bitchs who fake
Everybody is real and everybody two-faced
Heel, face, heel, face
