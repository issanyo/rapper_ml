[Intro]
Walk a mile in these Louboutins
But they don't wear these shits where I'm from
I'm not hating, I'm just telling you
I'm tryna let you know what the fuck that I've been through

[Verse 1: Iggy Azalea]
Two feet in the red dirt, school skirt
Sugar cane, back lanes
Three jobs, took years to save
But I got a ticket on that plane
People got a lot to say
But don't know shit about where I was made
Or how many floors that I had to scrub
Just to make it past where I am from

[Bridge x3]
No money, no family
Sixteen in the middle of Miami

[Hook]
I've been up all night, tryna get that rich
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Milked the whole game twice, gotta get it how I live
I've been work work work work working on my shit
Now get this work (x4)
Working on my shit

[Verse 2: Wale]
Work, work, work, work
Yea you know I got that soul
I'm just watching Iggy pop
Don't stop it girl, you rock 'n' roll
All she say is "buy me clothes"
She don't want my time, she want the snort and my reply is nose (achoo!)
I wonder, DC where I come from
Please believe I don’t leave the scene but they gon' fiend for me, down under
SB, my youngins
Cobain, my soldier
Then Iggy called about the city, darling it’s a Dundee like Paul Hogan
Hold up, they gon' play this for real
Hold up, I ain’t playing with this here
Know what? I could skate with your chick
Nigga I caught her, you Foster, like “Australian for Beer"
Hold up, niggas start the show when he show up
With a lot of whores in that tour bus
Yet I’m still feeling myself, like Goldust
Better roll out, relax, and bring roll up
Better dress warm when that flow out
It’s beyond something that y'all know about
Folarin the God, ho work out

[Iggy Azalea]
You don't know the half
This shit get real
Valley girls giving blowjobs for Louboutins
What you call that?
Head over heels

[Bridge x3/Hook]

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Pledge allegiance to the struggle
Ain't been easy
But cheers to Peezy for the weeks we lived out of duffle
Bags is all we had
Do anything for my Mama, I love you
One day I'll pay you back for the sacrifice
That ya managed to muscle
Sixteen, you sent me through customs so
All aboard my spaceship to Mercury
Turn First at the light that's in front me
Cause every night I'mma do it like it's my last
This dream is all that I need
Cause its all that I ever had

[Outro x2]
Now get this work (x4)
Working on my shit...
