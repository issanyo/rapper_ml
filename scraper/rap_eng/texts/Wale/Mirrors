[Verse 1: Wale]
Mmm-mirror tell me I'm the realest
Since all these other niggas g-got gimmicks in ly-lyrics
Its all gun bustin, its such a lack of the subject
C-could I be that nigga rejuvinatin l-lovers
Ddd-did I stutter the missing piece of the puzzle
Feel like the only rapper that look at you with no trouble
Its easy on TV make them believe what they be seeing
M-Mirrors never lie so they keep eyes up on they re-runs
For fear of what you show them, reality is golden
Real recognize real, you need some ID to be noticed though
One of the coldest to mix pro-tools with your vocals
What the fans can't see that mm-mirror gon notice back

[Hook: Wale & Bun B]
Mirror mirror on the wall, who the realest of them all
They ain't hard, swear to God. These niggas ain't real at all
Mirror mirror on the wall, Is it right, is it wrong
It ain't hard, swear to God, these niggas ain't real at all

Mirror mirror on the wall, who the realest of them all
They ain't hard, swear to God, these niggas ain't real at all
Mirror mirror on the wall, Is it right, is it wrong
It ain't hard, swear to God. These niggas ain't real at all

[Verse 2: Bun B]
Say there Mr. Mirror, put yourself up to yourself and then
Just take a look at the reflection thats reflectin' in
Your own physical, superficial not spiritual
All the possessions you possess, and they can't keep your spirit full
You need to hear it fool, but you dont want to listen cuz
You so f-full of your-s-self that you just sit and judge
You point 'em out, and call 'em up, and then s-sit 'em down
Then you put fertilizer, lyin, spread the shit around
But if you took a second Mr. Mirror, you would see
That you just mad at you, man, you ain't really mad at me
You took the hatred of yourself and just project it out
No disrespect, you can't respect yourself then just get out
For real, you need to go away just like the rain song
Cuz you f-frontin and f-fakin its just plain wrong
So Mr. Mirror, man I'm just gon' keep it G
If you can't look up at yourself
How the fuck you lookin at me, mane

[Hook: Bun B & Wale]
Mirror mirror on the wall, who the realest of them all
That ain't hard, swear to God, these niggas ain't real at all
Mirror mirror on the wall, Is it right, is it wrong'
It ain't hard, swear to God. These niggas ain't real at all

Mirror mirror on the wall, who the realest of them all
That ain't hard, swear to God, these niggas ain't real at all
Mirror mirror on the wall, Is it right, is it wrong'
It ain't hard, swear to God. These niggas ain't real at all

[Verse 3: Wale]
Mmm-mirror, tt-tell me she the realest
I met her in the club and she wouldn't let me in it
S-seen her in a video, seen her in a magazine
See me I ain't frontin', we ain't see them titties last week
So far you nasty, ff-fuck you call that
I call that insecure, sh-sh-shawty think she all that
Ff-fuck outta here, thats how they gettin gas
'09 Gold Diggers, walkin with a different path
Find a dummy, wrap him up, let him fuck, suck him up
Gettin good graces, take his money, aa-another one
No longer (Caffera'), Surgery and maskera
Looking at your money
But c-can't look up in that mirror
Fearin what it show you, reality is gold
Real recognize real, real women dont know you
One of the coldest, the gracing on that pole
What them tippers don't see
I bet that mirror gon show you

[Hook: Wale]
Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the realest of them all

Mirror mirror on the wall, Is it right, is it wrong'
It ain't hard, swear to God. These niggas ain't real at all

Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the realest of them all
