I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Perfect niggas ain’t real
So I just keep my cash right and say fuck how haters gon feel
Cause I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Said you know real niggas ain’t perfect
Said I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Perfect niggas ain’t real
So I just keep my cash right and say fuck how haters gonna feel
Cause I know real niggas ain’t perfect
Said you know real niggas ain’t perfect

[Verse 1: Skeme]
It goes real niggas ain’t perfect, perfect niggas ain’t real
So I just keep my cash right and say fuck how haters gon feel
Cause man I was born real and gonna die real
You gotta stay down, that’s how I feel
Can’t be worried about another nigga
No, I just worry bout my bills
And I’m livin life to the fullest
Trigger finger itchin bitch then I pull it
Got me a 4-5, 19-11
With 4 metal jackets for these bullets
I done did everything that you couldn’t
You might sail out but I wouldn’t
And if the rap fall out then it’s traps all out
Bring the pots back cause I’m cooking

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Skeme]
And it go real niggas ain’t perfect
Perfect niggas ain’t real
Man ain’t one rapper in the game right now got a half a ticket with no deal
See I don’t fuck with niggas cause that shit weak
Besides dirty drank ain’t shit sweet
Snake niggas wanna go behind your back
Just like the pass from pistol pete
And these little niggas that be dissin me
Let nina sing to your new symphony
To keep it 100 I got old money
Now put it on yo head and you’re history
You can’t fuck with I, not physically
Not mentally, you ain’t shit to me
Money talks and bullshit walks
So you broke niggas just don’t mention me and I

[Verse 3: Wale]
They say trill niggas just working
I’m supposed to bitch
Real niggas ain’t perfect
But I’m close to it
Coast to coast, where your focus at?
Big up the coach and niggas stole from that
Where yo soldiers at? Where yo hoes is at?
All my niggas in tracks but all my hoes in check uh
Thought I told you that
DMV, you know we on the map
P.I.M.P they callin me cause all the H.O.E.S is calling back uh
Now we like em, love em and leave em man
You heard big brother’s CD
Now we both stay skeming
I’m out
