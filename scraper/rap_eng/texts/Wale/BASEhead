Introducing the baseheads ladies and gentlemen, this is Mr. No Days Off
And I do think I'm better than...fuck it

Can't get in my business know how no way they is fucking with me
I know a bunch of envious niggas don't love my city
It's all I got, all I know, don't ask why my heart is cold
Ain't come from no happy home, my pain y'all cannot decode
I record for my people, smoking on that broccoli so
Everything be REM, my eyes look like them Chinese boys
My rapport with them broads, nothing but phenomenal
Knock them down like dominos, all in their abdominals
I ain't tricking but they see you as a pot of gold
All these hoes all got a goal, that's when they all got to go
My heart is all kind of cold, hope that you all got a coat
Leave them with a smaller buzz, lowest thing, vagina swollen
I am rolling, I ain't stopping, name a store that I ain't copping
I'm at Morgan, Howard, Coppen, trying to find that higher knowledge
Let's go shopping, get your purse, them bitches be tricking first
I be with designer women, I ain't talking Delta Burke
No dirt weed, give me purp with no seeds, please aboard
Inspired by that ganja most 9-to-5ers just can't afford
This flow y'all just can't avoid, this work y'all just can't relate
No days off is time gone, trying to get my paper straight
I get my paper, y'all just hate
No new nigga hot as me
No new nigga fly as me
Not cocky, that's just honest speech
You niggas is Ryan Leaf
You niggas is Bosweld
I am like what happens when our guard be on his job more
My niggas out southside, uptown, Ardmore
Mo County, VA, show is over, encore
Basehead with them boys, somebody called the law enforcement
This beat is a mahi tuna floating in some shark water
Finding-Nemo-ass niggas get your life together
I bet you like these rap niggas, ain't going to write it better
They some Kanye biters, I'm a cayun pepper
They is terrycloth with it, I'm Italian leather
I won't retire ever, nigga I'm forever clever
While we gon' forget you quicker than Hilary did with Trevor
No effort
Who better?
Not y'all
