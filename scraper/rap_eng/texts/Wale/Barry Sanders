[Intro: Paid in Full scene]
Tryna stay up out the light
Up out the spotlight
The club
And all that kinda stuff man
Tryna hide, tryna ignore
But its all fake
Understand what I’m sayin?
This life...
This game...
There ain’t no lovin it it don’t love you back
I feel your hate… I do man
But see man
A nigga like me man
I love the game
I love the hustle
Be feelin like one of them ball playin niggas you know
Like Bird, Magic or somethin
Yeah you know a nigga got dough, a nigga could lead the league
But if I leave…
The fans still gon love me man?

[Verse 1]
I need your admiration for infinity
Not that this ain't lucrative, but I just need your energy
I got the passion to please, I will not gasp or fatigue
And the way I'm ballin, gimme a Grammy or Danny O'B
Standing OV, let these bitches follow me
And I just give them D, give them D like they is out the league
Hasheem Thabeet and various other peoples
The pressures of greatness always comes with critiquing
Newest of sneakers, you consuming the bleachers
Blewin' some reefer in my zone like a 2-3 defense
Double-M G up, we up, y'all just relax
See uh, all my females show bust, Curtis Enis
Nittany Lion, my Penn State it, niggas recite it
I'm Michael Jordan major, you niggas Harold Miner
Pussy be all on me, we too young for romancin'
My niggas never block, I think I'm Barry Sanders

[Verse 2]
Vic Page never made it, Len Bias never made it
See God gave us the talent, but the devil make us famous
My effort is contagious, so check this BOA shit
With this recording I'm as sick as Jordan before Game 6
Jazz talkin, I bet I pick and roll with your bitch
You got some paper for me? Hit me on the Hornacek
Walter Payton Mercedez, sweetness in every ride
Hold on my pupils slowing, I don't got no lazy eye
Kicking flows, pockets about as thick as strippers on poles
Zone blocking with these bitches, I'm just picking a hole
Pardon that jargon but since I'm balling they getting salty
They all catching feelings, I should Biletnikoff 'em
Them niggas talking, they like man he official
Man, you Olowokandi I'm just being Pacific
I'm just bein' prolific, right now don't need no Mrs
I got a rack of Trojans, no ring, my Lane Kiffin
I'm tryin' pimp em I'm trying to be that cool
All them bitches Converse with me off that React Juice
Now Jordan III my shoe, Double M G my crew
When you do it big as Manute you make it seem minute
Ricky Moore Flightposite, Mike Bibby blue Foams
Interscope feeling like Charlotte when they traded Kobe you know?
But I let it go, Rozay finna re-up
He got himself a Kobe and they stuck with Vlade Divac
And we no la de de da I don't care for any people
Shallow bitches go Hail Mary when I throw that D-Route
Ha, now keep out, me and my whole team out
And I'm as high as Deion feet is headed to the house
