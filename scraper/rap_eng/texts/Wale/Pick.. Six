[Deion Sanders speech]
I created this image
This thing that you could imagine
You could love it or hate it but he was prime time

[Talking: Wale]
All green nigga pick six
Y'all ain't doing shit
Look
Don't get offended

[Verse 1: Wale]
Word go get some rollers
Word go get the bitches
Never been to the moon this reefer will help you visit
Bitches is 40 deep in this muthafucka and twisted
They ain't trynna be groupies
They just trynna be with us
You just trynna be haters
We just trynna be winners
I ain't trynna be forward
But is you trynna be dinner
Flick up, put your feet up
Put a Double M G up
Though we always on TV all these niggas never see us
Wassup DC, got work in that 305
Beetle the skin on my female that's word to Cee-Lo she fine
I'm optimistic like playing Keeno with all that you got
I never ever can see no when I be in her slot
I'm trynna beat up every beat until my feet at the top
I ain't fucking with KFC but I may eat up the box
It's alright, if it's right
If it's not tell them bitches take a hike, word life
Take advice keep it clean don't complain
Never give a bitch a ring if she ever been a train
That's real shit real nigga life
Don't know what y'all tribe called but I be spittn Phife
Ali Shaheed Muhammad Q-Tip I'm trynna follow
I be so Ivan Drago this beat gone be Apollo
This summer gone be mine though
Impeccable give it my note
Bitches be Columbiano
SpiffTV mi hermanos
If you working as hard as that then you deserve a bottle
I deserve a touch of sky been climbing from the bottom
This Prada make me shallow
These chalance give me balance
These paper from Bodega
This bag is from Seattle
I'm bragging cause I can fathom when I ain't never have it
Now I got that home base swipe I don't ever tag it
Nice nigga outfit clashing
Ignorant denim no wonder I got mad kicks
This pair of sixes is paranormal that rare shit
I'm Air Jordan you Ron Harper just fitting in
Bullshitting that nigga did his shit for the Clippers
I'm just thinking from reefer keep on talking from liquor
I'm the talk of the town
Every town that I been in
I don't handle these bitches till I handle my business
Scramble like Randall if John Randle was trynna get him
Deion Sanders you bullshitting I'm pick sixing

[Someone Talkin]
When you making a difference it's gone be haters
When you provoking change it's gone be nay sayers
People don't condone what they've never seen
And some of the stuff I tried to do they had never seen
