Intro (Evan):
So, were the weakdaze in case u don't know
And we're gonna rap slash sing on this beat
And we hope u like it
Shout out wale for the beat let's go

Verse 1 (Evan):
We always kept it lit
We never turnin split
We all like to run
And we don't play with guns
We just like playing sports
And make y'all teleport
To a new music space
Make sure you brought your brace
Cuz this a new legend flow
Take off like Apollo
If you don't rock with it
You don't have to listen
We just make it for fun
Even if ya don't like it
Please don't run
We're just trying to make a hit
Mo

Chorus (Mo):

We are the weakdaze
We ain't getting paid
And we don't go astray
We never waste a day
We just keep grinding
Till the morning sun light in
And yall anit ready when
We start making wins
We just haven’t made it yet, (x4)
You can be laughing now
While we still down
But its cuz
We just haven’t made it yet

Verse 2 (Sam):

We're learnin to spit
We're tryna make it lit
We are.      Artists
We all try our hardest
Brothers
Friends
All the way To the end
Ups and down
'Nd the bends
Mercedes Benz
Driving down the coast
Tryna make the most
God blessed us
In him we trust
Back to the start
Back to the heart
And were doing our part
And we don't need a go-cart

Chorus (Mo):
We are the weakdaze
We ain't getting paid
And we don't go astray
We never waste a day
We just keep grinding
Till the morning sun light in
And yall anit ready when
We start making wins
We just haven’t made it yet, (x4)
You can be laughing now
While we still down
But its because
We just haven’t made it yet x5
You can be laughing now
While we're still down
Buts it's because
We just haven't made it yet

Bridge (Evan):
Were trying to find out place
Not running your rat race
Just running our own pace
And we bringing the hard base
We might take some L's
Can't even rent a motel
But at least we don't smell
So that's, why were trying to tell
You, we just turn up
One of us is from Europe
And we also like to worship
Not sippin that syrup
Evan out here ballin
Sam ain't never fallin
And mo is always callin
"Turn Up!"
