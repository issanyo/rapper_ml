[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games
I'm just a sucker for pain
I wanna chain you up
I wanna tie you down
I'm just a sucker for pain

[Verse: Wale]
I'm like a masochist, ay
Come and be my love, yea
You'll be my safe place if you'll be my drug
My pain, my sanity lives in you
And shit cool as long as the queen happy to Clicquot
Sucker for love, call me sucker for love
Fallin' in love is truly like succumbing the trust
Get the nastiest babe
You gon' need my love, you
Won't receive out of no one
Before I leave I'm comin'

[Chorus: Dan Reynolds]
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
