[Intro]
I promise it comes with a gift
How awesome is this narcissism?
You save your hard earnings
To pay for these nigga's opinions

[Chorus]
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see?
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see?
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see

[Verse 1]
Said it ain't on me so I need more bottles
Okay these lames gon' see that a nigga ball harder
See I got it to a T cause my T cost dollars
Still my chain so big can’t pop my collar
Cold stunna
Rose-gold, four somethin'
Conchords wet as shit ho, these Oceans 11’s
Club jumping
And it’s like I got a black heart
Ever since I swiped that black card
And I think that shit with 10 bills
Let these niggas know we in the building
Because I spend these 7 bills
Bitches tryna give me all their feelings

[Pre-Chorus: The Wise Guys]
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

[Chorus]
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see?
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see?
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see

[Verse 2]
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see?
Ya ain’t paying for no pussy but you pay for what she see
M.O.B., M.O.B
Yes, as far as I can see
But these broads jocking me is validating my conceit
Obviously, show your bread
Don’t you wonder why she here?
Open bottles, open convos, open wallets, open legs
Open cleavage, open eyes, open ride, open thighs
Oh behave
My old school got more vroom than your new ride
Look at me, look at me
Now he creeping up the street
Couple thousand on that V, got you stuntin on IG-
Ram, damn, plan, scheme
Just to show you that he got it 'til they raaaa ra raaaaa (gun sounds)
Must of been plotting while they twatching
Living for these bitches
Niggas dying over 'posites, bitches dying for attention
Niggas drop it just to bop em
Is it really that important, is it really that serious?
I'm curious, this really shit we living for opinions

[Pre-Chorus: The Wise Guys]
All around me are familiar faces
Worn out places, worn out faces
Bright and early for the daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello teacher tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me

[Chorus]
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see?
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see?
Now look at me, look at me
How much vanity you see

[Outro: Magazeen]
We’re fucking up the club now, club now
D'Usse and the Rose now, Rose now
They say how far we pulling in, pulling in
Watch me make me do me thing, do me thing
We’re fucking up the club now, club now
D'Usse and the Rose now, Rose now
They say how far we pulling in, pulling in
Watch me make me do me thing, do me thing
Take it
