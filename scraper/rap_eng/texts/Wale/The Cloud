[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Let's get high, kill these lows
Let's get fucked up to the bone
Blowing trees yeah we do the damn thing all the weekend weekend
Let's get up, let's get down
Come wit me you'll smoke around
Beggin please don't be shy no it ain't no secret secret

[Verse 1: Wale]
Yeah a nigga been cold wit it (yeah)
Married to this rap shit and yall just go wit it
Oh here we go again eyes a lil lower I be 420'n when I'm 310'n it
High grade karma, pass me the ganja
I swear to god I hit it like I'm Garciaparra
Far from alarmed, I just part wit my problems
I party on the stars bitch I'm farther than a Martian
Pardon my absence, I'm actually far out of town wit a pound
Bitch, I'm parked on a comet
Fried than a mugg, OG kush i need another nick -- Starks at the garden
Holla; Cheech, Chong & Folarin, only get high when my lows come often
Hoes out in Boston, hoes out in Crofton, hoes in the cold, if them hoes keep talking
Huh all we ask is trust, all we ask is good to decorate the dutch
Never late for lunch, never fade the uh
If you killing your lows, then honey raise it up

Let's give up, smoke that dro, we gonna smoke till we can't no more
Smoke that weed then we do the damn thang every evening evening
Lets get smack, lets get fried, lets do anything you like
Huh I can't sing it -- TT, you got it
Uh lets go

[Hook]

[Outro: Tiara Thomas]
Let's get high, kill these lows

Boy, you know I'll smoke you out
Haha no secret
