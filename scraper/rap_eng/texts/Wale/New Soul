[Hook]
I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take
I'm a new soul, I came to this strange world
Hoping I could learn a bit 'bout how to give and take

BKS, Craig B., what's up? (It's the Best Kept Secret!)

[Verse One]
They used to call me the future
A month later say, "Fuck it, I'm growin' used to him"
See they use me, then they the new me
Though I recite it like it Lucifer's loose leaf
But you ain't never pleased, maybe you should leave
And find a Newport and I don't mean no loosies
Nor Desi Arnaz, though many aren't as poetic as this though
Many on-sites claim prophetic, they is
Professing they found one ready as this
So tell me I ain't shit, go and embellish it a bit
But I never break a sweat, it takes effort to conflict
So if they better than the kid
I guess I'm Leftwich 'cause I still get to win
Dig? And what you heard is thunderin'
No Vince Young, I did superb on the Wonderlic
New Soul

[Hook]

[Wale talking over the Hook]
Go ahead and google the Wonderlic test. Ha ha
Shout out to all the Freshmen. Asher. B.O.B. Scotty, what's up?
Wiz Khalifia. Drizzy Drake. Wale

[Verse Two]
See, most sites will give me three and a half
Four on a good day, but this morning I missed a cab
So let me tell you about this guy
He hit me on AIM, I respond, he replies
Like, "You sick Wale. Real talk, no shittin'
I love what you're doin'. I'm just hopin' you continue
Allow me to give you couple tracks that I'm pitchin'"
I decline for the moment he unfollows on Twitter
Huh?! Now ain't that a bitch or two
Sideways niggas keep tryin' to make them Bishop moves
Now concentrate until you get the Juice
But I'm done teachin' niggas though it's school
Nigga this class, nigga this cash
And I've been puttin' in work, nigga just ask
Hot 97, Y'all I was just at it
So you can see why they mad, look at they status
New Soul

[Hook]

[Verse Three]
Yeah, I never dreamed of a gift
And I've been uplifting the people I'm with
To speak from the soul and just leave it with them
With an impending mixtape that only seems like a myth
And things seem to conflict
New soul verses the O.G. it seemed as a hit
But it seems like a scene outta flick
It seems to remind me of a scene like this
Analyze and persist
I decided my pride is just why I resist
That's why I conflict with the why, when, and ifs
The Jiggas and the Tips
The Ems and the 50s
And I'm the fuckin' best, never mind if you iffy
So while the world goes Drake crazy
I'm Danny Granger
I'm just workin' with a different Pacer
Speed up, patience, please cause
Slow and steady wins this race
Fuck leadin'
New soul

[Hook]

[Outro]
Appreciate all the support everybody. I hope you enjoy the mixtape
DC Chillin'. PG Chillin'. Ha ha ha. Yeah!
