[Intro: Wale]
Uh, find me a Kendall Jenner, I'll be a gentleman to her, catch up
Give me a Jourdan Dunn she never gonna finish a nigga
Hol' up

[Chorus: Wale]
Walk by, on fire, baby, can't douse it
That body bangin', what set that?
You should model, girl, who do your booking?
Walk by, on fire, baby, can't douse it
That body bangin', what set that?
I walk by again, a little look quick, hol' up

[Post-Chorus: Wale]
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
My bitch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Make sure your posture's right baby
Show some love tonight

[Verse 1: Wale]
Mmm, I know a thing
And she tell me fuck her and call her a bad bitch (go)
I can never cuff her, I'm stuck on this rap shit (go)
Fuckin' up the budget but nothin' but rap shit (woo)
Mmm, I know a thing (go)
Shea Butter Twitter be callin' shawty a queen (go)
Head game silly, might give her the Don C (go)
Hair game killin' I get her a new McQueen (woo)
In case you behind though
Let me remind you to wait, then I make my move (who are you?)
Wale from the Maybach crew (Maybach Music)
Heard about me, what they say about you?
Heard about me, what they say about you?
Heard about me, what they say about you?
Heard about me, what they say about you?
Party in the hills, tell that pussy come through, hol' up

[Chorus: Wale]
Walk by, on fire, baby, can't douse it
That body bangin', what set that?
You should model, girl, who do your booking?
Walk by, on fire, baby, can't douse it
That body bangin', what set that?
I walk by again, a little look quick, hol' up

[Post-Chorus: Wale & (G-Eazy)]
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch (Wale I got you)
Switch, go switch
My bitch

[Verse 2: G-Eazy & (Wale)]
Eazy, you wanna sit front row? (Switch)
Ask me get anything that you want, though (Switch)
She a fashion killer, me I'm a cutthroat (Switch)
Goin' out tonight, she said that she wants coke (mmm)
1 Oak or Webster, up and down (yep)
Paparazzi gonna think that I'm cuffing now (nope)
It's casual I'll call you up when I'm back in town
We fall out but she always come back around
Hit Barney's and fuck up a check there
In the dressing room, fuck have sex there
"What's taking so long?" "Oh, she trying the next pair"
People see us everywhere and they just stare
And she mixing off white with SL
I got my Vans on, bitch, I dress well
I'm from the Bay, I see her once in a blue moon (Blue Moon)
Until Paris Fashion Week, how soon is too soon? Ayy, Eazy

[Chorus: Wale]
Walk by, on fire, baby, can't douse it
That body bangin', what set that?
You should model, girl, who do your booking?
Walk by, on fire, baby, can't douse it
That body bangin', what set that?
I walk by again, a little look quick, hol' up

[Post-Chorus: Wale]
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
My bitch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Switch, go switch
Make sure your posture's right baby
Switch, go switch

[Bridge: Wale]
(Get the best stone, froze, be the demise of you
Get the best stone, froze, be the demise of you)
Switch, gold switch
Switch, gold switch
Switch, gold switch
Switch, gold switch

[Outro: Wale]
SAP to code, code
Damn I was froze
But I'm hotter than you
SAP to code, code, code
SAP to code, code, code
