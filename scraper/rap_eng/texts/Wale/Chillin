[Chorus 1: Lady Gaga & Wale]
Look at, lookin' at, lookin' at me
Look at that, look how they lookin' at me
Eyes all stickin' Like honey on bees
Look At that, Look how they lookin' at me
Yeah, DC chillin', PG chillin'
My name Wale and I came to get it
Came to get it, came to get It
My name Wale

[Verse 1: Wale]
Shiiit, This how you start off '09
Kickin' in the door, and I'm everybody problem
Stuntin' in some other Jordan Nines
I got Phil Knight talkin' about "How you got them?"
Let's talk about the cars y'all got
You say you got a lotta whips, well I got a lot
I got the right to be cocky
Get so much cut disc jockeys jock me
You niggas mad cause you not me
I remain a giant while you're Jeremy Shockey
And if you ain't heard me properly
If you speak garbage, then we no capiche
DC chillin', PG chillin', floor To the ceilin'
Stuntin' in my Billionaire gear on my
Millionaire frames, that's money on my mind, Wale

[Chorus 2: Lady Gaga]
Get 'em all, get 'em all, pick it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks
Across the pond, they all know us
International, whoaaaa!
Driving my car to a foreign place
Lookin' at me, now they know my face
We want it all now, we got it all, yesss
Look at that, look how they lookin' at usss

[Verse 2: Wale]
They keep sayin' whale, but my name Wale
Hoes call me "Mr. Never-Wear-The Same-Thing"
You redundant, You never ever change
And I'm the same way, M.I.A
And me, Cool & Dre gettin' high like planes
Your man Wale in his own damn lane
Can't control the box, you are no Mills Lane
Ain't heard DC since Sardines came
Ha! And I made y'all love it
We don't cop pleas, but y'all don't cop nothin'
Police come around don't nobody say nothin'
And you be with the cops, you niggas is McLovin
Dark liquor 'til we busted
'Til I got a buzz like that nigga Chris Mullin
District of Columbia
You Bernie Mac funny, we ain't scared of none of ya

[Chorus 2: Lady Gaga & Wale]
Get 'em all, get 'em all, pick it all up
Stack up your funds like a million bucks
Across the pond, they all know us
International, whoaaaa!
Driving my car to a foreign place
Lookin' at me, now they know my face
We want it all now, we got it all, yesss
Lookin' at, lookin' at,  lookin' at usss
Yeah, DC chillin', PG chillin'
My name Wale and I came to get it
Came to get it, came to get It
My name Wale

[Verse 3: Wale]
Dre, pickin' my, pick'em
I'll shut them all down
Haters in the crowd, if you see 'em, point them out
Stacks in my jeans, broads on the scene
Folarin be ballin' for all y'all to see
Ain't I something? The way I'm stuntin'
My material girls give 'em A-Rod Moneyyy!
LV on my luggage
Them Bammas goin' hate, and I love it

[Chorus 1: Lady Gaga & Wale]
Look at, lookin' at, lookin' at me
Look at that, look how they lookin' at me
Eyes all stickin' Like honey on bees
Look At that, Look how they lookin' at me
Yeah, DC chillin', PG chillin'
My name Wale and I came to get it
Came to get it, came to get It
My name Wale
