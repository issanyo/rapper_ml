[Hook]
I've been wanting it for a long time, for a long time baby
I've been wanting it for a long time, for a long time baby
I've been wanting it for a long time, for a long time baby
I've been wanting it for a long time, but for a long time, it's been the wrong time ay yeah
Whatever you want it's on you, it's on you, it's on you baby
Just know whenever you say it's on you, it's on you, coming through...

[Verse 1]
I've been wanting it for a long time, hoping one day you'll be all mine
Dimes are calling like a dime a dozen but I don't recall knowing a goldmine
Haven't loved in such a long time, days alone making the song rhyme
Dating off and on found you losing love, had to call you like so sorry
But I've been wanting you for a long time, lies killing my whole vibe
Hard to give a lot, hard to give a lot, lot of pipin', and lot of pride
Call you back when my phone dies, but I've been up for like 4 nights
I don't know magic but I try to have it, maybe turn a best friend into a dope wife, baby...

[Hook]
I've been wanting it for a long time, for a long time baby
I've been wanting it for a long time, for a long time baby
I've been wanting it for a long time, for a long time baby
I've been wanting it for a long time, but for a long time, it's been the wrong time ay yeah
Whatever you want it's on you, it's on you, it's on you baby
Just know whenever you say it's on you, it's on you, coming through...

[Verse 2]
I've been on you for a long time, S5, cocaine white
Shoulda came through with that six deuce but might wake the block with them brake lights
But I've been stunting for a long time, still the reason I can't wife
I got trust issues, got lust issues, and I've grown anemic to the lime-light
We've been down just like four tires, you the call when my soul tired
I got both sides when them hoes out but I'm in yo bed when that moon's out
Cuz the moon's out baby, the moon i'll call ya, and the moon gon know why, Ms. Moon I love ya

[Hook]
I've been wanting it for a long time, for a long time baby
I've been wanting it for a long time, for a long time baby
I've been wanting it for a long time, for a long time baby
I've been wanting it for a long, but for a long time, it's been the wrong time ay yeah
Whatever you want it's on you, it's on you, it's on you baby
Just know whenever you say it's on you, it's on you, coming through

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh Ms. Moon, enough is scarier than forever, but make my forever your forever, then forever and ever, too soon Ms. Moon
I see now over my brows, my mind pretty God, if you don't mind, I'd like to see you soon. Fuck with me
(Just know whenever you say it's on you, it's on you, coming through)

What up Lou, how you doing today? You're most likely still sleeping, you were slightly twisted last night, um, you were saying some wild stuff, too. I'm not really sure how truthful you were or not, but you kept calling me your moon, and you know, I'm just trying to check in on you, see if everything is ok and see if you, you know, feeling today how you was last night. Alright, holler back, it's Eva, hit me when you get this!
