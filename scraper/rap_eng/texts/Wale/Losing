Fuck the demons that money keep on bringin'
The funny thing is when you make it, you gon' keep it
They're smokin' K2 'round my way, them niggas crazy
Used to save the bitches now we all just save the babies
I met a dancer, met the president, the mayor
In just order in one day, now, how your day went?
And before Jeremy Scott, I wore all that Moschino
Let you niggas whore it out, I'm off the Valentino
See you know I been trend-settin', my man picked the six up
And yeah I got a new bitch, and yeah she so vicous
My man keep a blicka, my man got the chopper
My meechy got the hol' up, but don't know what to call that
And lately I been feelin' feeling different
Like "I'll never be anything like any you niggas"
And kids say I'm celebrity, really?
No, I'm just another nigga that pen all his feelin's
Finesse and mover of rhythm

[Bridge: Victoria Monét]
Promise me we good, love, I'ma have to pull up
Just so you don't go too far, no
I just want that good love, just like how we should love
Can't you feel my tears through the phone
I ain't losing you on Sunset
Flashing lights, those girls ain't [?]
I ain't losing you on Sunset
Hearts get broken on this boulevard

[Hook: Rochelle Jordan (Sampled) & Wale]
Losing myself to find you
I am losing myself to find you
I am losing myself to find you
I am losing myself to find you
