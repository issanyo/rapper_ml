Ok!

[Hook: Sam Sneaker]
Face down (face down), ass up, that's the way we like to fuck

I got all these hoes trying to fuck
I got pussy on my mind and got patron all in my cup
And I got shawty on the line tryna do the you know what
And I ain't gotta say no words
You know I swerve if you know her
Cause I don't play I'm like no way
And killing them hoes is 2 on 1
I take her home I touch that down, you take that home and you won't punt
Cause ya'll gon' kick it, and about my business
When it come to them hoes man I got them bitches like I got my city cuz I run that shit
But I'm like face down and you're ass up and your ass up and you're face down
She coming up trynna catch breath, I grab her weave like stay down

Look I got a rubber off in my pocket, never slipping I got it

Matter-of-fact I'm lying, I'm high as fuck like I'm flying
Got perks off in my system, I tell them hoes when I get them, put yo

Her pussy good, my dick is gold
I'm in yo hood I probably fucked your ho
These bitches nasty, I need my nuts licked
These bitches know I got that deep up in yo gut dick
Face down, with yo back arched, fingers spread that ass apart
And I'm deep in it and she leak in it, bust a couple nuts, then sleep in it
Don't you try to run where that pussy going?
I eat cray on the week day, weekend her 3 friends
Gotta a nigga going off the deep end cause I'm deep in when I dove in
And I'm so in when I go in, pussy feeling something like the ocean
She ain't even let a nigga know when, you just gonna leave a nigga soaking
I'm with that and I get that finna send another nigga's bitch back, hold up

Yo ass big so throw that, yea bitch throw that, throw that
Hold up, hold up, my dick so swole up
Deep throat, throw up bad bitches know what? I want yo

[Verse 3: Wale]
Couple bad independent women in my section
You be tricking dollars I don't even pay attention
And I do be popping bottles and I don't think it's a problem
So just hold up, let me open up with this ganja
Ya face down, ass up, oh you think you all that
I say that we see wassup and play let's see who call who back (aha)
And now you mad, saying that I treat you bad
Cause when I treat you how I treat you and leave you, you be needing baths
Now we had Magic and Onix tryna see what's happening
Trust me I throw this back she bust it like that Peter Pan
See the plan come alone or go back home
And if they act like they dont know, play this muthafuckin song
