[Chorus: Miguel]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments in vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Verse 1: Miguel]
We talk street art and sarcasm
Crass humor and high fashion
Peach color, moon glistens, the plot thickens
As we laugh over shot guns and tongue kisses
Bubble bath, Truth or Dare, and Would You Rather
A cold flame, the thrill of no shame
Drugs, sex, and polaroids
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye all night

[Chorus: Miguel]
I wish I could paint our love
These moments and vibrant hues
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
And pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Bridge: Miguel]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Verse 2: Wale]
Ay we back though
The sun's still there, look
Good morning baby, didn't mean to wake you
But divine is your precious time and my temptation
Never mind that, I guess I'll climb the ladder later
'Less you try and put your back on me then I'ma take it
What is this, macchiato I'm tasting?
Caffeinated your body, I swear that y'all only stay up
Grab a towel, she need it, now she open again
She say my stroke is a scone, I let that soak in her bean
What's up with it? Ok what's really good (more)
I never knew your bad side until you show your goods
Ok what's up with it? Just let me set the mood
She said she don't on the first night, the morning wood
We talk, recent movies and old tunes
Emulate 50 Shades over Jodeci grooves
But I'm joking, I'm tryna sing your body that notion
If nobody throw me a float, then I'ma drown in the ocean
Come and take this work
Fuck around and be late to work
As the conversation fades let's play "you hang up first"
With your silly self, pictures in my celly, well
Kisses give her goosebumps, well that's cool I used to tutor braille
'Sup baby, ain't mean to wake you
I can put you back to sleep if that's a consolation
And I'm tired of waiting, so no more disappointment
I'm not your regular Joe, I'll be your coffee in the morning

[Bridge]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Part-Chorus]
Wordplay, turns into gun play
And gun play turns into pillow talk
Pillow talk turns into sweet dreams
Sweet dreams turns into coffee in the morning

[Bridge]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Bridge]
Coffee in the morning
I don't wanna wake you
I just wanna watch you sleep
It's the smell of your hair
And it's the way that we feel
I've never felt comfortable like this

[Outro: Miguel]
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
Two lost angels discover salvation
Under glass pink skies watching the sunlight
(Coffee in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Coffee in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
(Coffee in the morning)
Old souls we found a new religion
Now I'm swimming in that sin, that's baptism
(Coffee in the morning)
Pick a star in the sky
We could both say goodbye
