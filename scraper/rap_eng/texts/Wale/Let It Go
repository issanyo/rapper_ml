[Chorus]
I told you once this baby
I told you once but I know
You've got to let it go
I told you once this baby
I told you once but I know
You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
I already told you what I know
You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
I already told you
Look, okay

[Verse 1]
Okay, my heart been cold
Okay, my watch is cold
But I know what time we goin'
'Cause only one of them broken
Hey love, they say all good things don't last
Hey love, how can I blame you for my past?
Situation got me thinking crazy
Maybe 'cause you've been too clingy lately
Maybe I should make my motto “Let somebody meet my flaws and teach me patience”, I dunno
It's a thing we saying
'cause we all got hurt, but we don't heal the same but I dunno
It's a thing I'm thinking
Would you rather heartbreak or not feel a thing
See I dunno

[Chorus]
I told you once this baby
I told you once but I know
You've got to let it go
I told you once this baby
I told you once but I know
You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
I already told you what I know
You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
I already told you

[Verse 2]
Don't wait on me, or be lowkey
Girl either way imma be lonely
'Cause I know me
The times I dig
My own way when nobody love me
I got some issue
I'm tryna figure out
I'm boutta get signed the fourth time in a row
Plus I'm heavily flawed, God designed me a little different
Always at odds with my mind and my heart, ay
And I hate to break your heart, or waste your time, for the time I'm sorry
But I think relationships should all be yachts
We all get on and off in timely order
How many waves did you sail?
How many done rock your boat?
Nevermind that ain't my business
Lemme find out I'm insecure

[Chorus]
I told you once this baby
I told you once but I know
You've got to let it go
I told you once this baby
I told you once but I know
You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
I already told you what I know
You've got to let it go
You've got to let it go
I already told you
