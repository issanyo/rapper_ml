[Intro: Eric Bellinger]
Oh, oh, oh
This gon' be your favorite song

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger + Wale]
Ain't that Lisa with the C-cups?
Know I seen that chick before
Yeah that Lisa with them double D's up
No I ain't hittin' that bitch no more
Now ain't that shawty who got to the money
When Dr. Miami switched that up
Wait hold up, let me check my phone
Yep that's her, she still in love

[Pre-Hook 1: Eric Bellinger  + Wale]
A nigga left to the right, do right, like right
They know it's up
Look at shawty tryna hide, but no, I saw her
Just give me one...

[Hook: Wale + Eric Bellinger]
Give me one, give me one
Give me one, one reason baby
I'll flex on you
Give me one, one, give me one
Give me one, one, give me one
Give me one, one reason baby, I'll...
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Dang, my new bitch look better than my ex girl
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you
Ayy, my new bitch look better than my ex

[Verse 2: Wale]
You supposed to ride with that nigga, right with that nigga
Hand on the Bible, empower that nigga
Smile at that nigga, crash with that nigga
Movie be dumb as hell so you laugh with a nigga
Cry with that nigga, apply all your effort
You can be mad at times but in time just forgive 'em
Be there for a nigga, you can shine with a nigga
America can be so fuckin' hard for a nigga

[Pre-Hook 2: Eric Bellinger  + Wale]
To the left, to the left, right over there
They know it's up
A new nigga got  a hand tryna flex, but can't pay the tabs
Just give me one...

[Hook: Wale + Eric Bellinger ]
Give me one, give me one
Give me one, one reason baby
I'll flex on you
Give me one, one, give me one
Give me one, one, give me one
Give me one, one reason baby, I'll...
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you
Flex, flex, flex, flex
Dang, my new bitch look better than my ex girl
Flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex, flex
Give me one reason, I'mma flex on you
Ayy, my new bitch look better than my ex
Give me one, give me one
Give me one, one reason baby
I'll flex on you
Give me one, one, give me one
Give me one, one, give me one
Give me one, one reason baby, I'll...
Just give me one reason, I'mma flex on you

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
Flex, flex
Give me one reason I'mma flex on you
Flex on you
