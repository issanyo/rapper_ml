[Intro: Wale]
Aye
Chaz you call, Landover jaunts
Before you call the mother fuckin' College Park jaunts
Get the nearest intern to DM the bitches
I'll bring some unicorns

[Hook: Wale]
No shade, no shade
I just wanna touch, I ain’t got no shame
Get into your brain, swimmin’ in your soul
Never give you shade, I’m ready for us to glow oh
No shade, no shade, no shade
I just wanna touch, I ain’t got no shame
Get into your brain, swimmin’ in your soul
Never give you no shade, I’mma let that thing glow

[Verse 1: Chaz French]
How you want me to love you
But always push me away
How you said you care for me
But always leave me confused
Why would I leave now
Knowing you want me to stay
Why would I give up on a feeling I know can't be replaced
You expect me to act like nothing ever happened
And we was just friends for nothing
Like talking everyday
Couldn't eventually be something
But I'll take the blame for jumping to the assumption
I guess I made an ass out of you and me for the fuck of it
But you played a big role in it, got caught up in the obvious
Holding on to your past, thats how you strangle your future, I know
I got so lost in what we could have been
While became the person that broke you heart
And you shouldn't have
But you know what they say about the good and how they finish last
I just wanted truth and reassurance I was cool with that
Guess you pulled a me on me, Honestly, I ain’t used to that
But I still get the honour of knowing what I was feeling was genuine
And you with the upper hand
Silly me for ever thinking a broken heart can understand
When I thought it was right, you felt it could never last
But I put that on my life, you gave me reason to love again
And I could never throw shade
What's the worst you could say ?
Is that we wasn't together so I shouldn't feel played
Man I compromised daily
Try'na give you your space
Even hung up the Jersey
Try'na avoid all the games
See that was my decision so it's not you to blame
And its not like I was rushing I just knew I was late
And I guess all you wanted was the honeymoon phase
See thats just what I get for taking risk out of faith
But I could never throw shade baby
I know you fuck with me when you wanted drugs
I know you like me more when he's not involved
And you deal with some problems I could never solve
But I could never throw shade baby
Yeah and I ain't saying that it's all good
I don't need no explanation cause its understood
Just know I could do you better than he ever could
And still never throw shade baby
Yeah No shade, No shade
No shade, No shade, I could never throw shade
Throw shade

[Hook 2: Wale]
No shade, no shade
I just wanna touch, I ain’t got no shame
Get into your brain, swimmin’ in your soul
Never give you shade, I’m ready for us to glow (oh)
No shade, no shade, no shade
I just wanna touch, I ain’t got no shame
Get into your brain, swimmin’ in your soul
Never give you no shade, Imma let that thing glow
Let it go, let it go, let that thing go
Falling in Love you ditching your halo
I'm hoping that the Lord show up
Tell me he know I'm in love
But my rain gon' turn into a wave soon
Ay boo no shade, no shade, no shade
I just wanna touch, I ain’t got no shame
Get into your brain, and i'm swimmin’ in your soul
Never give you no shade
Baby let that thing glow, let it go, let it go

[Verse 2: Chaz French]
You got it, you got it
Know you got it for certain
It can always come back if the feeling is worth it
No you busy young and famous I respect all the working
It could always be right but it could never be perfect, no shade
No Shade no shade
I could never throw shade, throw shade
I could never throw shade, throw shade
I said it breaks my heart to break your heart
But mine is more important
I know it broke your heart to break my heart
But thats just not important
No shade, No shade, No shade, No shade

[Hook: Wale]
No shade, no shade
I just wanna touch, I ain’t got no shame
Get into your brain, swimmin’ in your soul
Never give you shade, I’m ready for us to glow (oh)
No shade, no shade, no shade
I just wanna touch, I ain’t got no shame
Get into your brain, swimmin’ in your soul
Never give you no shade, Imma let that thing glow
Let it go, let it go, let that thing go
Falling in Love you ditching your halo
I'm hoping that the Lord show up
Tell me he know I'm in love
But my rain gon' turn into a wave soon
Ay boo no shade, no shade, no shade
I just wanna touch, I ain’t got no shame
Get into your brain, and i'm swimmin’ in your soul
Never give you no shade
Baby let that thing glow, let it go, let it go
