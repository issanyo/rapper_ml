Ali:

Hold up!
Black excellence
I be repping it differently uhh
To Howard coast tell em how are you with this rapping thing uhh
Underrated from chocolate city with all the flavor
My bitches ball like im Q Mcall they Sanaa Lathan
Black excellence
We depart from the negative boy
Black denim that keep a knot like a pessimist boy
Black niggas, hate black niggas that’s evident so
Keep black windows
With masked niggas
That never miss boy
Charles Manson is celebrated somebody save us
Dr. Sebi was really curing what people gave us
Im a beacon of what you become if you got passion
I feel like Ali
But feel like I be where all the cash is
Never could reach the masses
Label said im to deep
Then I told them people let’s drown then
Blacks executed for moving around and maybe I think to deep, but  think it be for this brown skin
Pro black isn’t anti-white
But how we act like we don’t seen no tiki torches at night
Dig
Pro black isn’t anti-white
But if a Nazi try me, catch these Ali hands on site ya dig

Uh
Yo
Boy
Yea

Black excellence
A young perfectionist
White America fear us intelligent man with melanin uhh
Rap effortless, son of African immigrants
Every bag of this pack like I’m ‘bout to ptttthhh pttthhh with anyone
You a field nigga, (field)
Posin’ Ass real nigga
An uncle Tom that can sorta rhyme, so they deal with ya
And me I see through it
The honorable Wale Folarin, Cassius Muhammad, Sonny Liston you heel niggas
Say my name......Olu
Now Say my name......Olu
Tell the ref to lift up my fist
Which to aim and pay me my loot
Black excellence uhh
Black Lexus that ahh
Never drive it, ride me if you get the drift
I’m the underdog, they don’t talk about what I’ve done, (no)
The odds seven to one to seven bell you’ll be done
I talk how I talk, (talk)
I’m walking that walk, (walk)
Could never fight for a country that want me to fall
Exile for a short minute when Zyla was born
I
Beef with her mom a lil its throwing me off, (Sorry)
But I’m back that’s my word, (word)
If these bags that I be in a speed bag it’d go brrrrrrt yea
Like that with the words, (woo)
Black excellence
Chocolate city bitch
I’m on the phone with [?] and [?]
Talkin a milli bitch
Just the correctional, cut the message off really quick
No pressure, impressive, despite they’re effort I’ll hit em again

Double M and DC y’all, and ima rep my dog

Yea
Naw,.
Y’all never catch my bars
I mean I write it, I really write it
I’m still southpaw
Awkward
Lefty
Introvert, it’s hard to get near me
That’s why I’m in interviews high
Cause I be highly defensive, forreal (real)
Im Black and Im proud
No walking me down
We shocking the world again let me give that out

Black excellence

Black excellence

Black excellence

Hold up

Yea hold up

Say my name Olu....
