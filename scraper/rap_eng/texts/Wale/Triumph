[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen

[Verse 1]
I ain't tryna be politically correct
But I won't rest till I'm given my respect
And my vision isn't set on the money I get
But more or less the vets, I'm comin' for y'all neck
I ain't jealous or vex, just feelin' how you felt when you came
More or less, change is imminent
I ask Mr. West for a lil bit of help
Realized us new niggas gotta get it ourself
So I dreamed of presentin' myself
And the only thing I fear is Iovine's shelf
The cocky, liveliest for nobody
Book so many bitches should've been a cum laude
Fuck the comradery with B rate artists
I'm ballin' you niggas is Arliss so watch this
Always knew where the pot was
With no receivers had the pickin of a option
Tommie Frazier on the motherfuckin' one or two's
Or Michael Vick if ya'll bark nigga y'all through

[Verse 2]
Yea, 25, 25, 25 can I get 30 my side jones is fat and my freak jones is purdy
Why? Cause I Mac like Bernie and she swallow everything like Kirby
Not Puckett but I hit it then I duck a bitch
And older women put a nigga on their Bucket list
Me against you the movie of the year
Cause you slum dawg and I'm the millionaire
Their buzz internet and mine’s inter-national with a National’s fitted cap
I know they suck I’m just showing you where my city’s at
Where fiends always on that water like a lily pad
But since Mark put a nigga on that lily track
I had the British shows talkin bout bring him back
But that's a shitty accent you should've figured that
Cause I been drinkin till the point that I'm a dizzy rap
Scab, fix up look shop joe
Cause I'ma look that part until I'm all broke, yea
