[Intro: Wale & Eric Bellinger]
Yeah
Truly the greatest baby (Whoo)
All hail to my faovrite lady (Yeah)
And I would elevate your name but I'm sayin' you already an angel baby
It's Eazy

[Verse 1: Eric Bellinger]
Shawty bad, slim, thick
She my drug, she my fix
And I'm all up in her mix
She be mixin' with the wrist
She the plug, she finesse
She the one they call the GOAT
She don't stress
She don't trip and she fuck with all my bros

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
So if I gotta choose someone
Then it must be her she been here since day one
I guess I'ma have to call her bae, I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess we gon' have to go hit London, Paris and Montego Bay
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess she gon' have to scream my name
Now every time that she come to the crib
I'ma break her back like I break that bank
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yo, yo
I guess I'ma have to call her wait
I need someone to call me a cab
I drunk too much but I'm on my way
I hate fake love cause I love too hard
Inhale, cough hit the blunt too hard
Come to your job bring lunch one time
Then leave your job and you don't wanna say bye
I never say bye 'cause we just say ciao
She the bitch, she a dolla not a dime
Super thick, super fine
Most important super smart
I celebrate for your intelligence
Fashionista so effortless
To tell the truth I got a rack of joints
But If I had to choose I might tell her this

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
So if I gotta choose someone
Then it must be her she been here since day one
I guess I'ma have to call her bae, I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess we gon' have to go hit London, Paris and Montego Bay
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess she gon' have to scream my name
Now every time that she come to the crib
I'ma break her back like I break that bank
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae
I guess I'ma have to call her bae

[Bridge: Eric Bellinger]
She the GOAT, she the GOAT
She the GOAT, she the GOAT
Greatest of all time, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gucci on all the time, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
She the GOAT, she the GOAT
She the GOAT, she the GOAT
Greatest of all time, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Gucci on all the time

[Outro: Eric Bellinger & Wale]
Shawty bad, slim, thick
She my drug, she my fix
And I'm all up in her mix
She be mixin' with the wrist
She the plug, she finesse
She the one they call the GOAT
She don't stress
She don't trip and fuck with all my bros
It's Eazy, Wale too
All the time, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Greatest of all time, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
The Moon and back, yeah
Mixin' with the wrist
That's my plug, that's my chick, yeah
