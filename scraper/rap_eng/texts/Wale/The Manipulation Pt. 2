[Intro: Wale]
I got that better love, that no one better love, that here today gone tomorrow but this forever love
Let me mine you until your vagina is wet enough and fill your mind with pleasant thoughts
Champaign by your tub, rose petals as she walk, you know the floor don't need to see you
I got that good stroke, come be my Mona Lisa
You see, them other guys pay their mind to your physical features
And I can admire your body but your mind is much deeper
And I found me a keeper, and I found me a winner, and I found me a queen
What we eatin' for dinner? You know I cook it and clean it and do whatever for you
Black mother of the earth you know I forever owe you
I would never ignore you ‘cause I'm forever loyal
Let's fall in love, let me put my seed in your soil
See it'd be an honor to create life with you; can I lay right with you? And wake you up with light kisses?
Good mornin' sunshine, see the more I see your eyes is the more that I admire you
Whenever you tired I be right there beside, the pillow talk and confide, make your secrets all mine
May I sleep between your thighs and wake up deeply in your heart?
And you're mindful forever and repeat when we get up
I ain't even gonna front girl I think you is the one, so let's fall asleep with the moon and I will greet you with the sun

[Interlude: Elaine]
This whole sex thing is totally overrated. Now the one thing you've got to be ready for is how the man changes into a completely different person 5 seconds after it's over. I mean something happens to their personality, it's really quite astounding

[Verse 1: Wale]
That scary love, never get married love
I got that fuck you or make you love me temporary love
I just pick and roll these hoes; I don't even know these hoes
I cut ‘em first, cut ‘em deep I fuckin' Sheryl Crow these hoes, ha
Hey that pussy like some water hose and I'mma need to cum first, yeah her turn be optional
Modify your posture ho, mother fuck a cas, no?'
You can't see mi casa, we gon' rock at this Econo Lodge, haha
You know I’m stickin' to that proper code: strapped up, lock n load
Go stiff the condom broke, ain't no baby father ho, fuck that baby father shit
I don't respect no brain unless we talkin' that saliva spit
Ho I got a lot of bread, lot of whips, lot of chicks
You can be demolished then be gone without acknowledgement
This just how it got to be, this is how I got to live
I don't care about your drive unless you talkin' ridin' dick
You is just a groupie bitch and groupie bitch, no I am sick
I am sick of women treatin' niggas like that lotto ticket
Yeah my shit ain't no scratch and win
You just tryin' to get over, so baby get over, here
And get it open, get it open, get it open
