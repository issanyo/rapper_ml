[ hook (written by Wale & Tiara Thomas)]

Is it bad that I never made love, I never did it
But I sure know how to fuck
I’ll be your bad girl, I’ll prove it to you
I can’t promise that I’ll be good to you
‘Cuz I’ve had some issues
I won’t commit, no, not having it
But at least I can admit that I’ll be bad to you
Yeah I’ll be good in bed, but I’ll be bad to you

[verse 1]

I was once sold on the idea of togetherness
So i bought it
Invested everything I had in me
But still, I couldn't pay the mortgage
It took being left for hopeless
To see that I couldn't afford this
Had my passion repossessed
And so my love became an orphan
My last relationship left me jaded
And I know it's unfair to you
But after all is said and done
What else is there left to do
I can try to make it make sense
You can try to fly in and save me
But everything in my past tense
Has been present to me lately

I can’t promise that I’ll be good to you
‘Cuz I’ve had some issues
I won’t commit, no, not having it
But at least I can admit that I’ll be bad to you
Yeah I’ll be good in bed, but I’ll be bad to you

[verse 2]

Yeah, I know sometimes
My mood can swing around
But I've been through some things I doubt
You even knew existed
I'm not tryna make excuses
Just thought I should let you know
That the skeletons in my closet
Have started rotting
Decomposing
So whenever I try to go in
They're pulling me by the hair
They say, "Where do you think you're going?
Nobody's gonna love you out there!"
They tell me
"Stick to what you're used to, used to
You're only into dudes who will use you then lose you."

[verse 3]

Listen, this isn't a cry for help
In fact, it's not much that I ask from you
The situation explains itself
But that doesn't make it understandable
So you should probably take a seat
I'll do what it takes to make you get comfortable
I just really don't want you to leave
Because together we could be something so wonderful
But i doubt that's something you'd undergo
And I don't expect you not to get mad
In fact, you'll probably be gone
By the end of this song
So is it really
All that
