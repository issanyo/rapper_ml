[Chorus: Weensey]
Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke
Ask 'em what do they know, ask 'em can we go
Pretty girls, sunshine in the air
Perfume everywhere, girls are everywhere

[Verse 1: Wale]
Bass to the floor, right now, what up
A lime to a lemon, remind you of the sky
When I'm fuckin' and we on cloud nine for that minute
Admire your style and your physique
And I ain't tryin' to critique but you deserve a good drink, so what's up
What you sippin' on, it's no problem
Black and gold bottles like I'm pro-New Orleans
But, shorty I'm far from a Saint
But I got two A-Mex's that look the same way
Wale, D.C. thats me, huh
My Prada say Prada and they Prada say Fila
I ain't gotta tell you they know about me, huh
Come to D.C. and I can make you a believer
See, baby, I'm a leader day away from a Libra
And I ain't tryin' to lead you wrong, sugar, I need ya
So would you please listen to what I'mma need from you
Live for tonight, before tomorrow's amnesia

[Chorus: Weensey]
Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke
Ask 'em what do they know, ask 'em can we go
Pretty girls, sunshine in the air
Perfume everywhere, girls are everywhere

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Hey, girl, say, girl, ain't no time to play, girl
I'm a tell Sean Taylor I want that girl
Yeah they call me Gucci, but I'mma buy you Louis
Yellow stones on my wrist remind me of a slushy
Girl so fine, wanna ride me like a Huffy
Ugly girls, quiet, pretty girls ride
Country girl, city girls, love to float by me
Got her in the bed with kid, straight wildin'
Took her to the club bought her three more bottles
She from Rhode Island, Atlanta, I reside in
Big black diamond, bigger than a black razor
Asian, Black, Caucasian, or Blasian
Persuasing so amazing, it's amazing
How they stand there, cuffed up, patient
Waiting for the perfect time for conversation
My observation tell me that she Gucci's baby (baby)

[Chorus: Weensey]
Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke
Ask 'em what do they know, ask 'em can we go
Pretty girls, sunshine in the air
Perfume everywhere, girls are everywhere

[Bridge]
Ugly girls be quiet, pretty girls clap, clap like this
Ugly girls be quiet, pretty girls clap, clap like this

[Verse 3: Wale]
Okay you have em in amazement; switching four lanes
In that 09' range while I'm singing old Tre shit
(Let's just dance, come around my way
You can hit some J's), It's like this all day
Okay my name's Wale they probably know me from the you know
Boss in my Hugo, floss like my tooth hurt
My flow is on Pluto, them rollins ain't plutons
And a nigga have ‘em beefin’ on who gon' twist up my new growth
Ha, yeah shorty that's G-shit
Tokyo spinners, yeah shorty that's G-shit
Please get hip to that new D.C. shit
On my PG shit, I ain't finna keep them
And I be with P, so I got BBC shit
Even if I didn't I would ball like Arenas - swish
Now, shorty this is what I'mma need from you
Live for tonight, before tomorrow's amnesia

[Chorus: Weensey]
Girls, I ask 'em do they smoke
Ask 'em what do they know, ask 'em can we go
Pretty girls, sunshine in the air
Perfume everywhere, girls are everywhere

[Bridge]
Ugly girls be quiet, pretty girls clap, clap like this
Ugly girls be quiet, pretty girls clap, clap like this
Ugly girls be quiet, pretty girls clap, clap like this
Ugly girls be quiet, pretty girls clap, clap like this
