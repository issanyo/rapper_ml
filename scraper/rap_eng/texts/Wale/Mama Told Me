[Chorus]
Mama told me it'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think it'd be a day like this (naw)
Not now not ever
And now until forever you will never need another (nigga)
Mama told me it'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think it'd be a day like this (naw)
Not now not ever
And now until forever you will never need another (nigga)

[Verse 1]
Sorry hip hop, it took me so long to get on
But so long that I'm on it, it's on
I'm rappin' for the scholars and the hustlers, meanwhile
Showin' mama I ain't dropped out for nothin'
I swear these dolla's gon' add up
And I ain't shallow, material things suppress bad luck
That's why I shine like I does
It's pain in my eyes but these Yves Saints blind you to look
Binded between, carryin' the flag for an area that drag
Whoever tried to gravitate
G told me it's a city full of crabs
I'm feelin' like a platter at Phillip's when I rap
As much as I wanted to be minisculed the fact is
They'd only be happy with a minstrel actor
Sorry Mr. Charlie won't chap dance
And fuck the radio for tellin' me to snap jam
I'm just expectin' the spectator's respect here
My net is from jet setters to cab fares
Hip-hop's unbalances got out of hand
Ain't have to see-saw, I'm already scared
I been called the heir apparent to guide us
Not DC, this whole fuckin' genre
And I ain't in it for them O's or them comma's
But more or less the hope for dope niggas to prosper
Yessir

[Chorus]
Mama told me it'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think it'd be a day like this (naw)
Not now not ever
And now until forever you will never need another (nigga)
Mama told me it'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think it'd be a day like this (naw)
Not now not ever
And now until forever you will never need another (nigga)

[Verse 2]
The future is now
I lead on record's dedicaton for makin' better music is now
Dope niggas locked out 4 year rap drought
It's rainin' now somehow the fugitive's out
I would invest in a poncho
Cause I ain't finna punch out like Glass Joe (Naw!)
Ima go until my arm's sore
Fuck it! I go until my 40 millionth encore
Hip-hop's dead yeah that's what Nas said to me
I guess us hip-hop heads are celery
We vegetables, on them record labels
Who's next to release? We guillotine them
Niggas braggin' but everybody stagnant
Everybody broke except the nigga on the track (Shit!)
And mama why you throw away my drums?
A hundred for a deal they made a hundred on the song
Nigga I'm a hundred miles far
I'm feelin' Chris Childs, you lookin' like Kobe Bryant jaw
It's lonely at the top so I waited, but ain't nobody take it
Now I'm playin' solitaire patient
Crucifix pieces, necklace with Jesus
See me as blasphemous for I don't need them
God give me strength, Allah give me patience
I am only a man and I don't know what to think

[Chorus]
Mama told me it'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think it'd be a day like this (naw)
Not now not ever
And now until forever you will never need another (nigga)
Mama told me it'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think it'd be a day like this (naw)
Not now not ever
And now until forever you will never need another (nigga)
