[Verse 1: Mark Battles]
Woke up today feeling like a million bucks
Sympathizing for the haters who gotta deal with us
We building up, Fly America is still a must
Forever grinding, I ain’t did enough
Hit em up, I pocket
Mama, I promise you I got it
Just tryna profit like Mohamed, had to get us out the projects
Born to live like the Obamas
So disregard all the gossip
And a memo to my haters, you can come on wit it
Look my boy in his eyes and say son go get it
It ain’t over til the drum roll finished
And my account got more commas than a run on sentence, see I can sense it
I’m right there, I’m yo favorite rapper’s nightmare
I don’t fight fair, you couldn’t walk in my nike airs
Same design but not the right pair
I’m something they never seen and so you might scare, a’ight yea

I’ve got a feeling
Yea yea yea

I’ve got a…

[Verse 2: Wale]
Yea
Glad I make a million with a couple sentence
Past premonitions, teachers used to speak of prison
I’m from a city where they hate you and you try and get it
And getting fried even if they got no pot to piss in
Listen, I’m tryna modify my ballad
Shout out to my niggas who can buy shit off a challenge
Yea, that’s Fly America, they boppin, where yo flag at?
Double M G, these other posses just pathetic
Can I get a little respect chillin
For the lean the jack spill it
More liquor, forgive me, a nigga be stressed
But when you in it and they ain’t givin you sympathy
Nah, you better off simply just chillin, keepin it to yo self
Got a feeling, by year’s ending a double million
Me and SB skating on a couple women
I need a SP, ballin shouldn’t be this simple
Call it like I see it, so you see a nigga been official

[Hook]
I’ve got a feeling
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea
I’ve got a feeling
Yea yea yea
Yea yea yea

[Verse 3: King Los]
Ugh
Sometimes it’s about…
Looking outside of yo self
And see the true reflection of life
King

They waitin for you to wait for it
See that way there’s no way you can make a way for it
Either it’s weight or it’s really the way
Aura works, or a star in the sky orbits
Or bits of aura over starring in the skies
Just hidin from all the bullshit and runnin from all the lies
All the cries in the universe symbolizing the ocean
Epitomizing the pitiful, simplifying this notion
And hope that these motherfuckers like hope
And if motherfuckers are up in this motherfucker but no
When one suffers we all do
We call you small, we belittle you
Cus really we all too small, we too little to
Chain down such a big monster called ego
Fight for all kind, be kind, be called hero
Be calm, be cool because they want your joy too
Enjoy yourself so someone else can enjoy you
King
