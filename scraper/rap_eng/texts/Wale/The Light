Uh, Rest in peace Jay Dilla
(Its Hip Hop)
Know I had to do a Jay Dilla joint

I never knew a luh, luh, luh a love like this
I put you over my money, all of my nice kicks
Mmm Not all of em, some still DS
My D & P frizest, they haven't seen the streets yet
As I speak to the speakers I'm hopin this reach ya
You are the flawless creature
I'm in awe from all of those features
Regardless to all them, I appease her
You is a dime to them other broads peace up
That means two, between me and you
There's nothing man made than can make it just you
My hearts been tied, my souls been glued
The whole block know who I roll with too
Them bitches all dimes and you are a tollbooth
I guarantee our change whatever we go through
I told you before the light I'mma show you...you

[Hook]
There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

Its important we communicate, intentions to be forever but never cannot wait
Never becomes prominent, all we doin is arguin
Arguably retarded cause after sex we stop again
It's the best, I've forgotten what a condom is
Life's a meal a good girl is a condiment
I compliment you with your conversation
Cause any girl could look good if she concentratin
And personality is somethin that you can't make up
Sense of humour is a tool that you can't change up
Look, I ain gatta tell you, you know what I'm thinkin
Yea, a nigga shallow but I'm a deep thinker
In life she the wife who was right in that deep end
Given her the TLC I'll never creep then
She make me Chili like T-Boz, me leave her out
I'd rather wear a pair of Filas or Reeboks

[Hook]
There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me

It's kinda fresh you listen to more than Wale
Nevermind I'm lyin she bumpin me all day
Honey is always the one I'mma call late
Night I need that she comin here right away
Night or day she need me
Hit it or four play
I'm feedin her the light just like what the chorus say
Hey, she give me love in abundance
Plus she outrun any youngin that I've hung with
A fun chick its nothin to break funds with
I can do a whole song solely on that onion
My soul searchin is halted
I have opted to stop watchin them broads that bin plottin
You so got me, I'm open for life forever my wife
Focus let me show you the light

[Hook]
There are times when you'll need someone
I will be by your side
There is a light that shines
Special for you and me
