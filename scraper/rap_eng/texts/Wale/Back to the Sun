[Intro]
Ain't anyone fuckin' with the mufuckin' God Folarin
Know what I'm saying?
Lexicon legend, hahaha

[Hook]
Niggas hate and niggas love
Niggas hate and niggas love
Niggas hate and niggas love

[Verse 1]
Fuck with me
Mh, yeah, packin' my bag, nigga
Tell them niggas who so called pass, I'm on that ass, nigga
Rare bitches in Raf Simons, my pack lit up
Loud in me, I'm flying high as Bilal singing
Boy, back in my groove, youngin'
Hundred-thousand for jewels, but it's cool, I let my clothes cover
And the hoes love it, but I got a good woman
And I never post it cause all them vultures will probably hover
What up? Thuggin', addressin' the mass public
Attitude is fuck it, I'm living what they covet, so run it
Younging, troubled, beginning was humble
Niggas flexin' for that Gram, but they still live with their Mothers
They suckers, they lyin', they liars, B's on my tire
It's two things I never mind is their opinion and stylists
I'm ridin', I'm sorry Folarin gotta be so defiant
See you Chiciate, Chico, leave your people to violet
Violent, quiet, I'm young, stackin' my fund
In the back of the bach, and I got my back to the sun
Got my eye on this young chick who be actin' and such
Never act up in public and rarely ratchet in clubs
I'm quite distinguished, and rarely do I mingle
And I really do my thing out here, really I just [?]
Eyes is on the prize, moon is in the sky
I used to sit up at night like I knowin' this isn't right, like God!
