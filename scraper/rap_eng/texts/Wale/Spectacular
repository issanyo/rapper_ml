[Verse 1: Wale]
'Scuse me miss, I'm trying to stimulate your mind
You won't find a G that is similar to mine
I'm similar to [?], I can show you where it's at
My name Wale, prolly know me from the rap
I've got a clean rap, we can ease to the back
Of the club, cut a rug, get a cup of that Yak
I slow 'em down, my game a yellow light
They speed past fast, I pull them over by night and
Dyke friends get pulled, they know the aim
Y'all all lames with Novocaine for game
I'm dope to dames, I'm Mike Phelps
A gold medal stroke, I float below the belt
I can see myself in you, you're something like a mirror
You're Lois Lane, so I sling game like a hero
I ain't Superman when I do the damn thing
Lex Luther here to write Kryptonite, get 'em right, right

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn]
You ain't even heard the whole song yet, baby
But I bet you want to leave in a minute
Alright, and I guarantee when I'm in it
Alright, that I'll be nothing less than spectacular

[Verse 2: Wale]
Excuse me gorgeous, I have crossed an ornament of beauty
And I usually don't be all up on 'em
But they all are fallin' when you started walkin'
My way, my game, like the Harvard college
Educate youngins, eight different subjects
He cram for exams, she gonna study it and love it
Chicks got class, I'm givin' up the tasks
But she gets an A+ if she givin' up that ass
Yes, no I'm just playin', I like a chase
Game straight forward, so they give me the right of way
Game take off, G4, I'm fly today
Dames leave y'all and he hard on my hideaway
He all stuck in himself, that's what they whispering
Nah, it's just game, ya dig
You need to listen in
Kick it into high gear, into my realm
She said, not on the first night
So I asked at 12

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn]
You ain't even heard the whole song yet, baby
But I bet you want to leave in a minute
Alright, and I guarantee when I'm in it
Alright, that I'll be nothing less than spectacula

[Bridge: Raheem DeVaughn]
Around 12, we can scream, go DJ
Around 1, you can have another drink on me
Around 2, you can get your girlfriends
Around 4, we can enjoy our privacy

[Verse 3: Wale]
I know my melo-Dior, but I'd rather be me
Than to try to be y'all, y'all try to be me
So my essense we be, but I'm better than y'all
You better than we, cause I bet it out me
Y'all in his apart with the men she approached by
Tellin' them more lies than OJ on trial
They givin' up more lines than Oprah on that show she on
This isn't Kosher, nah
Hope for y'all is little, but I give them some
I'm coach John Top-son, you're Iverson
The song I sung is sung from the soul
Since the boy hold a note like he work for the post
Follow my lead, give them game 'til they weak
Get her weak, she be leaving with me like Raheem
Veritable Visine, go and get your eyes clean
I'm the bomb to broads, I'm so bar-shalom

[Chorus: Raheem DeVaughn]
You ain't even heard the whole song yet, baby
But I bet you want to leave in a minute
Alright, and I guarantee when I'm in it
Alright, that I'll be nothing less than spectacula
