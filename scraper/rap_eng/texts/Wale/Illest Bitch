Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Yeah, that my sister and I'm so proud the way she hold it down

Pray you richer in confidence, when I'm paying you mind
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Yeah is the illest bitch alive as long as it round
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive

[Verse 1]
Fuck it now, nine to five keeping your babies fly
Know the time, know is like, no one know it should tight
No one know there's a struggle, no one know what it's like
How you're holding emotion doing twelve to life
Man it's straight and no fucking when you out here stressing
I can't touch just some pleasure I get special attention
Yeah this the illest bitch alive, I love her freaky side
And deeper that means you get the sweeter just rise for the

[Verse 2]
Baby father bullshitting, you two don't even speak
Ain't seen his seed in 14 days, that nigga too weak
Couple shy of a month, I ain't running you up
When it be too loose or you be too late, we ain't tying no knot
And I know it's double standards when you're fucking with us
But I pray these everlasting groupies don't fuck up this love
New Louboutins when she dressing, Louboutin please correct me
Stretch marks make her self conscience, I kiss her when we're sexing
Yes, it's the illest bitch alive, flawless and brown
Smoking loud, blowing down when the law ain't around
When it comes to underwater I get nautical shawty
Yeah, you leaving alone but came here with multiple shawty

[Hook]
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Yeah, that my sister and I'm so proud the way she hold it down, yeah
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Pray you richer in confidence now I'm paying you mind
Ohh illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
One time for the illest bitch alive, illest bitch
Illest bitch alive, illest bitch alive
Two times, two times for the illest bitch

[Outro]
And I promised myself I wouldn't tell you this shit today
But, tomorrow's uncertainty promotes the urgency in this shit I'mma say
Perfection doesn't exist if it doesn't consume her
And the truth hurts that this world's mine, but the womb is hers
Ms. Mother nature I pray that our daughters carry and favour your genes
And when you take off your jeans you get all the me that you need
That you allow me to work it 'til you know what your actual worth means
And for what it's worth, I hope a couple words could help you see, illest bitch alive
