[Post-Hook]
I, just know what I know
I say homies over dough
I say hoes under both
And I live by the code
I say stay away from hoe shit
Yeah then, stick to your own
I fuck with the people
Never been a thirsty neighbor
I could show you how a G look
I don't run my mouth
I mean, better run my town now
What the fuck is y'all about?

[Verse 1]
Fuck with me, fuck with me
All my day one niggas stuck with me
Tell my main bitch, never go too far
New song make a new broad fuck with me
Work hard nigga, sleep comfortably
Go hard nigga, eat comfortably
Do what you like but keep this dissin mine
Cheap talk will get your head bust for free
I could wave a price
Don't recommend the famous life
You know the hoes in the condo and the ladies like it
And she don't even know 'bout your baby's life
I'm crazy made, I'm crazy nice
Sleep the day, live some amazing nights
Amazing grace, nigga how sweet the sound
Reefer loud enough to shake the sky
And I been a nigga where I come from
Dew baby in the cut tryna hold tight
Two strikes, shooting dice when he roll up
Get it, I got 100 niggas, they need me to win
20 something niggas that need a Benz
How many niggas your niggas is really friends?

[Hook]
It's too late, it's too late
I'm smoking buff up too late
I'm married to the game, ain't too faithful
Cheating with the money and the fame
It's too late, it's too late
When I get on, whole crew straight
When I get on, whole crew straight
And I pray to God I ain't too late

[Post-Hook]
I, just know what I know
I say homies over dough
I say hoes under both
And I live by the code
I say stay away from hoes
Yeah then, stick to your zone
I fuck with the people
Never been a thirsty neighbour
I could show you how a G look
I don't run my mouth
I'm young but I run my town now
What the fuck is y'all about?

[Bridge]
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late
It's too late, it's too late

[Post-Hook]
I, just know what I know
I say homies over dough
I say hoes under both
And I live by the code
I say stay away from hoes
Yeah then, stick to your own
I fuck with the people
Never been a thirsty neighbour
I could show you how a G look
I don't run my mouth
I mean, better run my town now
What the fuck is y'all about?
