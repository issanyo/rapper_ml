Uh. Lets do it
Uh
Folarin not havin it
Cover this track like a motha fuckin laminate
Yeah, real niggas in my cabinet
You the type of nigga make a stripper turn celibate
Lets celebrate, levitate, with the loud
Never wait when we out
Fuck a line, get in now
What they bitchin bout?
What the goin for?
Polo head to toe no zone 4
Kick game Henry bitch, bonjour
Winter time, Moncler
Summer time, different shore
This a different motor man better go to work
Rapper tryin trade places like I'm Mortimer
Its no days off, although I'm bored to work
But daddy gotta order somethin dealers can't afford
Ha, the envy of dime dealers
Bentley ain't mine but I let bitches recline in em
Tell em they mind clippin I give em like 5 minutes
Tell em we'll never be but they settle for side bitches
DC got wild niggas
Them .45 niggas
Some runnin' with 2 k's though we some live niggas
Don't get besides yourself, thinkin I'm with the loafin'
I just came back from Howard I made a gift for the locals
They hit em, flee em, delete em
Hug em, love em, then leave em
If you call me a genius, nobody would disagree it
I'm spotted on different beaches, Cohiba smoking reefer
I hope you hit me by 3, I'm incoherent by the evening
Whats up sugah, I'm diggin yah, oh you ain't feelin young'n?
Thats even better I'm not that into submissive woman
I'll like to tell you I'm the type to get all woman
I put that battery in backs ho small wonder
Its been a long summer, and I've been on my grind
We killin shows out in london like I'm on my grind
I think I'm Larry Hoover, I think I'm Big Meech
I think you need the streets to succeed the industry
But I'm a different route, hip-hop lyric route
Quote un-quote backpack still bring them bitches out
I bet you burcham, you fry chicken nigga Church em
Or Popeyes we don't keep no birds in the circle
Stop lyin ya'll pretenders ya'll ain't really workin
Ya winslower, than laura, though you niggas urkel
Kin folk, I've been dope since super soakers
No matter who gon' show up I make em move over
All that talk about who better than Folarin
Go and get that bread and they'll be penniless tommorrow
Living out of a homeless shit
Broke and no one notices
Ghetto whip you lisa like your Margerie and Homer's kid
Ride the beat own the bitch
Modify your quota bitch
PG bitches love me like I'm TCB band Polo bitch
North Potomac love me like a motherfuckin Jonases
That’s why we always go in them but we don’t gotta go with them
