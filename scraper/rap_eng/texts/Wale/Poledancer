[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, look, l- l- look, look, look, look, look
Wassup? Wassup?
Girl I don’t need you, I just want you, want you
She said I need to tell you something, boy look
Boy, I'm a freak, but I'm a woman, hol’ up
She used to be my favorite cheerleader, I ain't mad, I ain't mad
'Cause she' a paralegal with a bag, with a bag (Stunt)
Says Chanel on her purse, she ain't playing with these hoes
I need head, lick my blunt, she keep playing on the pole
What you knew? what you know? Girl, you got a body
Private show, she gon show after 9-5
I just wanna lay you up, I just wanna lay some pipe
She get paid for Fashion Nova, so she need that stomach tight
Fucking right
Poledancer, her DMs full of you niggas who got no chances
My DMs full of you bitches and some broke rappers
Hold that, I digress
Pitch two birds with just one pitch
She need D and can't find gym

[Chorus: Wale]
I told her workout, workout
I broke up with her, it ain't work out, work out
Oh look, my new work like to workout workout
She in the mirror tryna workout, work out
L- l- look, look, look, look, look, look
Poledancer, pole, pole (That’s right, workout)
L- l- look, look, look, look
Poledancer, poledancer, poledancer (Workout, workout, Stallion)

[Verse 2: Megan Thee Stallion]
He said, "I heard the best things in life come to you for free"
I say "Baby, I know you ain’t never met no bitch like me"
He said, "I heard you 'bout yo’ money, I ain't think you was a freak"
I invited all these bitches and they popping it for me
Oww, work out, pull up, workout
I took his money, then I burnt out, ayy skrrt out
Fucking with me, you gon' get turnt out, yeah, worked out
Now, bend it over, blow yo' back out, make him tap out
Bow bow bow (Shake that, shake that)
Loving my pimping, he made me his lady
Driving a Porsche with a bitch named Mercedez
All of these niggas be begging for pussy
Ain’t giving it to 'em and making 'em pay me
I'ma finesse him, and I'ma romance him
He got in this pussy and shook like a dancer
I need a boo with a real big ole' rooster
To come to the coupe and ruffle my feathers
Workout, workout
I took his money, then I burnt out, ayy skrrt out
Fucking with me, you gon' get turnt out, ayy, worked out
Now, bend it over, blow yo' back out, make him tap out

[Chorus: Wale]
L- l- look, look, look, look, look, look
Poledancer, pole, pole (That's right, workout)
L- l- look, look, look, look
Poledancer, poledancer, poledancer (Workout, workout)
