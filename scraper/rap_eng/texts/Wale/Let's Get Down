[Verse 1: Wale]
Ain't fuckin' with the flow, ho you can tell them that
Housin' all these monkeys I should wear a fuckin' yellow hat
Curious George, the realest nigga involved
My closet is like a mall, I be bombin' your car
My blunt is not a cigar, hold up, we blowin' loud
So tell 'em if they ain't sippin', roll up, it's goin' down
Bitch I'm faded, I'm faded, I'm mo' fuckin' faded
My audience a cross 'tween don, diva, and fade 'em
Man you playin', you playin', the latest Wale is
Kris Kringle to women, call 'em hoes, give 'em game, yeah
Six hundred benz, I got six million kicks
I know I'm lyin' and all, but I had you thinkin' a bit
And I can't keep you too long, but yo you see how it get?
Ain't always thinkin' what I'm drinkin' but still think you the shit
Jordan 4's, these bitches OGs
I think I'm just blazed, ghost-faced, snow beach
And I'm ODin', homie I'm ultra league
Star Trek shorty girl, see my bitches come in peace
Oh, hold it though
We all throwed, but you know I'm 'bout to order mo'

[Hook x2: Kaba]
?
One more hour
Whether rain or shine
Second wind

[Verse 2: Wale]
Fuck the critics, get with us, I told you I would kill it
All my niggas the realest, all my women friendly strippers
So we give it to live it, so pardon my position
Panties two hundred dollars, got dollars worth of a penny
I drink too much and I don't give a fuck
If I buy another joint I'm liable to need a crutch
I ain't stuntin', no promoter, they party need a nudge
It's if I pop in then pop out, we gon' party on the bus, what
Roll the weed up, shorty let her breathe out
I like the women with dirty thoughts and a clean house
A dirty mouth and a very clean everything else
And a bad lesbian that she gon' need help
Double U, leave 'em at the W
Ain't gon' never be the one cause see I am the number two
They might fall in love with you, tell you stuff that never true
My favorite bitch they kissin', whack, fuckin' fun, head is cool
