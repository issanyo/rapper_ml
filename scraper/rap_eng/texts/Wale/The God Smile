[Intro]
I shine, you shine
We fall
I shine, you shine
We fall
I shine, you shine
We fall
I shine, you shine
We fall
(Sometimes in life, the gods smile upon you my friends)

[Hook]
Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out
We gon' hold this city down 'til we see the whole city up
(Go shine, go shine, go shine your light on me
Go shine your light on me)
A1 when I'm on site, my day ones never think twice
Same one that get all the hate
Through it all I illuminate away
(Go shine, go shine, go shine your light on me
Go shine your light on me)
Nah nig, nah nig
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nigga
Don't you doubt it if you was my nigga
We ain't fall out so you still my nigga
Don't always call you but you've been my nigga
You're still the same, nigga, it's just the trust

[Verse 1]
Nigga when you work hard
Used to get the outfit up off Curt Bone
We done came a long way from the all day store
And now spending 8 somethin' out Bergdoff
Word up, pray to God that my set good
Stand close to my rivals
Like you got a job they would kill for
It's all good cause the flow is to die for
My God, nigga life like a dice roll
And it's twice hard throwin' 'em with mics on
I hit 'em with the rap, everybody slept
Then I came back, killin' everybody's nap like a hot comb
At Saks 'bout to cop more
And cop more if they got more
And come back if they got more
Middle finger to them folks, tell 'em Gabos
Cause this game ain't based on sympathy
Know that fame will steal your energy

[Hook]
Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out
We gon' hold this city down 'til we see the whole city up
(Lord shine, Lord shine, Lord shine your light on me
Lord shine your light on me)
A1 when I'm on site, my day ones never think twice
Same one that get all the hate
Through it all I illuminate away
(Go shine, go shine, go shine your light on me
Go shine your light on me)
Nah nig, nah nig
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nigga
Don't you doubt it if you was my nigga
We ain't fall out so you still my nigga
Don't always call you but you've been my nigga
You're still the same, nigga, it's just the trust

[Verse 2]
At 21, played running back
24, I had the city mad
Slim Charles in The Wire now
You could say me and him brought the city back
Used to hustle in hand-me-downs
Now I'm whippin' the Camry 'round
Hit licks in Baltimore
Gettin' Hip-Hop chicken in like Kevin Liles
Uptown, I learned a lot
Suburbs taught me good
The white girl destroyed the black neighborhood
So white boys can run the world
White cops is goin' to war
I write thoughts and put 'em in songs
And the devil around the corner
It's all good cause the God is livin' in you
Cops can look in the bag
Tricky to man so can you read a mind
And they used to go to Madness, and I ain't really have it
Somehow they let another Eddie advance
Well I shine for the niggas that passed
So my niggas in the pen got me pushin' a pad
Back in the crack era, daddy whippin' a cab
But now I'm pushin' a camper doin' a similar route
One time, Junkyard meets Jay Hov
Marion Berry meetin' with Barry O
This is Lil Wayne meets Wayne Perry
This is Bad Brains from the go go
I'm in tears so I'm thankful
Cause I got haters and I got flow
Niggas can't tell me nothin', I got this shit jumpin'
From the White House to The Black Hole
Don't let no lame tell you differently
Bitch I'm the savior of the DMV

[Hook]
Girls kissin' me all out, Christian Dior'd out
We gon' hold this city down 'til we see the whole city up
(Go shine, go shine, go shine your light on me
Go shine your light on me)
A1 when I'm on site, my day ones never think twice
Same one that get all the hate
Through it all I illuminate away
(Go shine, go shine your light on me
Go shine your light on me)
Nah nig, nah nig
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nigga
Don't you doubt it if you was my nigga
We ain't fall out so you still my nigga
Don't always call you but you've been my nigga
(Go and go shine your light on me)
(Go and go shine your light on me)
(Go and go shine your light on me)
Dream big, follow through bigger
Everything is nothing
But nothing is everything to you niggas
Hallelujah
