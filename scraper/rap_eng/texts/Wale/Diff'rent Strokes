[Verse 1: JR Castro]
First I stroke your mind 'til you're focused on me
Settle down, won't ya
Then I'll stroke your ego, girl you killing these streets
I'm blessed to be in your presence now
I'mma stroke your back 'til your pain fades away
I'mma lay you down, but I'm keeping you awake
Ain't no preparation for what's next
I'mma give you an example of the best

[Chorus: JR Castro]
I got different strokes, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, that right
I got different strokes, in the dawn, afternoon, in the evening, all night
I got one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, got a lot more to go
I'mma make all your favourite position
I got different strokes, wait and see
Yeah I got different strokes, believe in me

[Verse 2: JR Castro]
I'mma stroke my tongue from your lips to your lips
Put your hands on my head
Stroke it slow 'til the [?] grip
Better just hold on to my bed
Leg up, I'mma stroke it from the side, turn around, stroke it from behind
Stand up, let me stroke you from the wall, put in stroke in overtime
Ain’t no running out of positions
I’m grateful for this chance to prove to you

[Chorus: JR Castro]
I got different strokes, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, that right
I got different strokes, in the dawn, afternoon, in the evening, all night
I got one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, got a lot more to go
I'mma make all your favourite position
I got different strokes, wait and see
Yeah I got different strokes, believe in me

[Verse 3: Wale]
I dig you physical
I need to forget whatever you went through
Let's take a new step when I get into you
And I can get you striking the zone, I put you in the mood
Look up, look up 'til the sun done
Then we hook up what's up 'til the sun come
Sex a weapon, I make my gun go bang
And you laying for a day all slumped though
I need her mentally
Cause nothing important without chemistry
There's something so hot tell your body please
See there's other things you think remain interesting
So it's quite different when you're random
Woman I see insignificant
100 thoughts, can we share, want a penny and
100 strokes, let me know what's working

[Chorus: JR Castro]
I got different strokes, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, that right
I got different strokes, in the dawn, afternoon, in the evening, all night
I got one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, got a lot more to go
I'mma make all your favourite position
I got different strokes, wait and see
Yeah I got different strokes, believe in me
