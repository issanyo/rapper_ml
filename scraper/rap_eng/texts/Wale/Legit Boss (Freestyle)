[Hook]
I see who you really are
Moon in a sea of stars
You're every need I am living for
In my evening, we're never raw

[Verse]
Every empire should have a cookie position
And you are not a boss unless your woman official
And she command attention, that's why they look at her different
And she demand respect, and she flexing when she don't get it
Trust me I see the vision, trust me I know about you
People who do not know you should Google the truth about you
Shawty you're such a boss, boss, boss
And her Team B.A.D just like my single
When you see them go applaud like Day
Every week I spend at least 180 minutes looking for her
You niggas in the way say that's light-skin behaviour
I think it's more or less, she worried 'bout the bank statement
Keep her name up, keep her wing fly
She a diva, we'll see in April if they bling her
If they do not, shit, we riot
I'm the dude that got it popping, and I know you've got a dude so don't do too much of that talking
I can sort of respect it's platonic and honest for ya
I ain't know you before but your boyfriend probably spoil you
I'm just out here supporting them glorious boy shorts
Babyface these heels, you over with my support
Got me started, call me young Folarin
Drop a couple songs, pretty women follow
Catch me out in Boston, doing 180
Tryn'a put the title on a (woo) new Mercedes
Legit boss know what it’s hitting for
The type I can wink at and she get the hint or the type that don’t pick fights but they end 'em with close jaws
The type that say don’t come if you ain’t been sent for
10-4, hit a limp fool
Put 'em straight to sleep, I ain't CM or KENTA
If she was mine I'd be kneeling down, cause 20 by 20 that ring size

[Hook]
I see who you really are
Moon in a sea of stars
You're every need I am living for
In my evening, we're never raw
