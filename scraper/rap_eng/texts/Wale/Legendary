[Verse 1]
Top of the dome wit it, or wroten lyrics
They ain't grossing a million liquid, don't form an opinion
I'm sort of a genius, nothing short of a legend
Sort of Tommy Lasorda
The way I'm sorting these pitchers
Pictures whatever, fuck it my speech is off
Weekend trippin to wherever, only heaven is far
Metaphors in every color, these indelible bars
Jordan 4 seated floorside sitting with Mars
Only fear is mediocrity
So every time I got a beat I feel like I don't gotta sleep
You keep praying on your break, I hope you got a sling
Shot for all them shots coming out them beaks
Sort of like Socrates in a Prada tee
You can't kick it, your pockets thinner than soccer tees
People fucking with me, they ain't fucking with you
Lyrically top hmm, being generous too
I remember a nigga demo just sit in a room
Made some moves, now I'm known to spit December in June
Rented a coupe, cool, met me a chick
Always keep a rubber, word to Telly In Kids
If you gon do it you gon do it, go handle your biz
Or smoke some purp take a Percocet and Xanax and chill
For real, you real then you don't need to say it
It's something to be great, it's nothing to be famous..

[Chorus]
Fuck fame, fuck money
Fuck everything anyone can take from me
It ain't hard to make money
We young niggas, we just tryna be legendary

[Verse 2]
Zoning my second bottle, focused still on tomorrow
Sober thoughts keep me anxious, Moet gon' keep me calmer
Poetry keep her honest, these readings Stevie could draw up
Don't see this deeper than music, don't hear it but feel the author
I don't hear no talking, we just hear them barking
And you know you run shit when they pay you good for walk-ins
Failure is not a option, success is just a process
Say "yes" one time they use you, say "no" one time they plotting
Didn't make it through college, still debating my progress
End some friendships with homies, made some haters with albums
Limitation's for cowards, this is Che mixed with Malcolm
This is anti Mark McGwire it takes patience for power
Zoning my 6 -rillo legendaries forever
Roll a nick of that lala - that's how I plays it - mellow
Niggas plotting against you, hate you but never tell you
And I know my haters want to make my heart beat acapella
Hella proper, my garment is propeller of chopper
Cause I hella copped em so I could be way flyer than all them
I aspire for awesome and require some flossing
Only way they gon listen, find it highly unfortunate
Tryna see if real lyric spittin' can buy me a Porsche
Tryna see if I get my critics as silent as auctions
I decided to boss up, life's a bitch and I court her
Don't always fuck me good, I'm just too cheap to divorce her

[Chorus]
Fuck fame, fuck money
Fuck everything anyone can take from me
It ain't hard to make money
We young niggas, we just tryna be legendary
