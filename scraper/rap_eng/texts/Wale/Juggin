[Intro: Wale]
A hundred M's I'll never change up on my nigga
A hundred M's I'll never change up on my nigga
A hundred M's I'll never change up on my nigga
Change up on my niggas
(A hundred M's won't make me change up on my niggas)

[Pre-Hook: Wale]
I’ve been juggin' for weeks, I’ve been calling the shots
Movin' work out the suite, so they check in with me
So they check in with me, told me nothing is sweet
I’ve been juggin' for weeks, I’ve been calling the shots
Movin' work out the suite, you better check in with me
Me, yeah

[Hook: Wale]
Get it, go, get it, go
Get it, get it, get it, go
Get it, go, get it, go
Get it, get it, get it, go
Get it, go, get it, go
Get it, get it, get it, go
Get it, go, get it, go
Real nigga sticking to the code
Work

[Verse 1: Big Wax]
Say "Big Wax", say "Lincoln Heights"
So many a time my city, these streets, they almost claimed my life
But I'm still here, I buck'em
Still on the dice and I bust 'em
Then scoop the money like fuck'em
Know I be thuggin', no they can't touch him
Go to Bal Harbour, go to Club Liv
Then Ocean Drive, and take me a dime
A real nigga gotta live !
Circle circle boys, yeah you see us every blue moon
My city united and they guided, yeah that's coming soon

[Verse 2: Wale]
What's shaking there bro? What's the motivation there, Joe?
(Vacation is over, these niggas ain't faking no more)
Okay, I put you on, I was a GP
A couple songs like an EP
Young Folarin don't do lean
Three cups got 'em on three Z's
Me, just a green leaf
Little Hennessy really to complete me
Really these little niggas on anything
So if anything in the bing we should never think
Wal-ee say a piece, stay on your dean
Fuck a cellphone too, that's the second thing
Fuck a 3G phone, spent 3 G's on a badabing
Bararring before you get to speak

[Verse 3: Ab-Ice]
A hundred M's won't make me change up on my niggas
One-hundred M's, one-hundred M's
One-hundred M's won't make me change up on my nigga
One-hundred M's, one-hundred M's
I get it in, I get it going
I'm trapping on my freelanced phone
Two-hundred on the dash, I pull up GT chrome
Three-hundred, my style's born
And everything designer homie
Every time they say they waiting on me
So why these niggas hating on me
I'm just tryna make it homie
