[Intro: Elle Varner]
Jumping in my rover, I'm coming over
Jumping in my rover, I'm coming over

[Verse 1: Wale]
Hit you at eight then you better be awake by 9
If I say I'm on the way, better put away your little night gown
Girl, if you hit me at 10 you gon' need a trench coat 'n four towels
Courting not really my style, but I arrive I rose with no flower

[Verse 2: Elle Varner]
Boy I'm coming over leave your key under the door
I can't tell you when but maybe some time after four
Save your energy, gonna need it, you can rest assured
I'm gon' make you feel like you never touched a girl before

[Hook: Elle Varner]
When I come over tonight
When I come over tonight
Want you to give me the love that I need
Gonna make you sweat I'm gonna make you work for me
See I'm your lady but tonight I'll be your freak
Jumping in my rover I'm coming over
Jumping in my rover I'm coming over
Jumping in my rover I'm coming over
Jumping in my rover I'm coming over

[Verse 3: Elle Varner]
Grab me by my dress and slowly tear it at the seam
Throw me on the bed and baby I'll try not to scream
I get so excited when you take control of me
Show me all the ways I can go ahead and fulfil your fantasy

[Hook]

[Bridge: Elle Varner]
We can do it fast, we can do it slow
Any way you want, baby let me know oh
Give it to me now, take me on a ride
Baby here we go, gonna keep you up all night

[Verse 4: Wale]
Wale though, let's get it
Kiss you below
I bet them toes curl up
Can I take a swim in the door
Couple strokes 'til the shore shows up
Now you got a nigga hitting your phone
Trying to get you to go
Know I'm doing the most
And them I'm making emojis like 'clickety blickety'
Is it getting me close, or was the chorus too slow
Just know, are you feeling the vibe?
And I give you a ride I said I'm feeling arrive
I get as low as a lie
Wanna know, when I go up inside, you'll go as high as Mariah
This is how you know it's time to swing on by
When 'What you wearing?' and 'What you doing?' can use the same reply

[Outro: Elle Varner]
Jumping in my rover, I'm coming over
Jumping in my rover, I'm coming over
