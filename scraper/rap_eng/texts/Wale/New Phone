[Intro: Wale]
I just want y'all to know that money change others
More than the receiver of it and
Fame level, the shadiness varies out, to be in public
Fuck with me though

I need caller ID baby
(I still got Toni Braxton playing)

[Chorus]
So many hearts I can't mend
So many thoughts again and again
So many years gone by
So many friends is in the wind
So many niggas is really pretend
So many women who think they the shit
As I let the years go by, new phone who is this?
Got a new phone, who is this?
New phone, who is this?
As I let the years go by, same phone who is this?
Same phone who is this?
Same phone who is this?
So many years go by, new phone who is this?
Talk to me, what's up?

[Verse 1: Wale]
I'ma get it, I'ma get it, this easy
I'm the realest, I been kicking since Eastbay
I'm the realest, all my niggas in a good place
On the real, got my city with a mixtape
Now I never call like I used to though
But why you getting mad as if you don't know??
Like I ain't getting bags and my crew not on
Cause when you getting bags bet that loot gon.. show
I'm on the road, I'm on the road
Tan money, another show
We on the road, we on the road
Uh, Alize still hungry for it
Smoking haze in Hollywood, I'm real important
Tracy bringing the real bitches who looking for it
EBM, EBM this is bigger than all us
Looking like a hundred mill with infinite knowledge
Try and tell them little niggas this better than college
Super stupid, see my music should come with propellers
Stomach still hungry as ever
Even though I know this money is coming forever
Niggas say "get your dollars up, hope you stay the same"
So I'm counting my dollars and counting niggas change
And niggas tell me that I'm Hollywood
But y'all the same niggas that used to say that I probably wouldn't

[Chorus]
So many hearts I can't mend
So many thoughts again and again
So many years gone by
So many friends is in the wind
So many niggas is really pretend
So many women who think they the shit
As I let the years go by, new phone who is this?
Got a new phone, who is this?
New phone, who is this?
As I let the years go by, same phone who is this?
Same phone who is this?
Same phone who is this?
So many years gone by, new phone who is this?
Talk to me, what's up?

[Verse 2: Wale]
There's days I think of you, baby
And the things I didn't do, baby
Acting like I'm in middle school, now you really hate it
Sub-tweeting the shit out you, when a nigga angry
Get your feelings together, why you practicing hatred?
Immaculate statements for immaculate statements
Shackled and chained up, that's what the game does
Bitches that blow my high should go on my fan club
Bossed up like shit, bossed up like "shit"
Broads can't talk dirty, she flossed on my dick
Show up in Balmain, showing niggas that hate
Show up with bitches who think their horoscope is their fate
4 in the morning babe, no I'm not picking up
No, I'm not with a bitch, just I ain't sleep in a month
Hope you can understand I'm still the same one
But I'm finna change clothes, keys, and gate code
Here's the BANG button, cuz... this ain't the same number
Mmmm, mmm, mmm

[Chorus]
So many hearts I can't mend
So many thoughts again and again
So many years gone by
So many friends is in the wind
So many niggas is really pretend
So many women who think they the shit
As I let the years go by, new phone who is this?
Got a new phone, who is this?
New phone, who is this?
As I let the years go by, same phone who is this?
Same phone who is this?
Same phone who is this?
So many years go by, new phone who is this?
Talk to me, what's up?
