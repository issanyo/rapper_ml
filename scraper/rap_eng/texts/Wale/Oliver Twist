Semtex said we good, then we good then
All the niggas in the back, where your hood at?
Tryna buy another sack, where the good at?
Shorty throw it back, and a nigga might love that!
Yeah! Uh! Green and white flow!
MMG chain, lookin' like a light show
Lot of weed on me, no tobacco
And them hating ass niggas, we ain’t like those
No, no, we are not those
And I drop top off in a hot cold
..but I got hoes, so fly, we are saying, we ain’t got those
We exclusive, they be talking but they never do shit
And I be talking about me, I do this
I got the whole damn world on this shoe shit, true shit
Semetex said we’re good, and we’re good then
All the niggas in the back, where your hood at
Im trying to buy another sack, where the good at
Shorty throw it back and a nigga might love that
Fuck that now trying get the money
When I arrive the whole town gets sunny
They giving pounds and that before get the money
They giving me pounds and thats of course getting money
Niggas hate us, but we famous so I never blame them
I’m just saying they’re mad cause I don’t make much
Spent a hundred quid on these trainers, they up
Break it out, puck it out for a young G
Young thing said she never been to South Beach
Pack it up thirty minutes to the jet leaves
Best (?) Jet Li
Work, work, work, work
