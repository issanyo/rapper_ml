[Verse 1: Price]
Hold it down
Me and my niggas is all about the cash
Me and my niggas is all about the dough
Walk through the door five pounds of gold
Feeling like my head is where the crown should go
I see a lot of girls that used to front on me
And now they see me I'm on it wanna fuck 'til the bed break down
I see a lot of niggas who was hating back then
And now they see me and they wanna give me handshakes now
But I ain't, really, with, all that, fuck shit, nigga back back
I used to have a 9 to 5 taking out the trash bags
Now everybody talking about me pound pound hashtag
But I do this proper, play no games
You can keep it on the low then I ain't saying no names
What we drinking what we drinking take it all to the brain
Going this hard is gonna probably drive me insane

[Chorus]
Right now I'm trying to get turnt up
So nigga pass that drink
And I don't even smoke, but girl pass that weed
Man I'm trying to get faded
So faded, that it's gonna last a week
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me

[Verse 2: Wale]
Say yeah though,Yeah though
Give me head baby I can make your head blow
Getting high make her wanna bust it real low
Spread em out legs looking like a field goal
Extra point lets have a sex appointment
A lot of girls but they is less important
What's the problem, let Folarin hold you
We could stop negotiate the proper process
Like yeah though,Yeah though
Straight from Washington look
Most my dogs be moving loud as shit
Thats why I ride with Audio Push
Say yeah though,Yeah though
We're young but we're not children
Had braids since like 0'something, but had them hits since 87
Get me

[Chorus]
Right now I'm trying to get turnt up
So nigga pass that drink
And I don't even smoke, but girl pass that weed
Man I'm trying to get faded
So faded, that it's gonna last a week
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me

[Verse 3: Oktane]
Do you swear to tell the truth
The whole truth and nothing but the truth
So help you whatever-idol-you-worship
Well that's perfect
Cause we finna play ten fingers shot glasses out
Anything you wanna know baby ask it now
And the game don't stop until all of your fingers are in your palms
Or one of us passes out
Convo of this liquor got you wetter than the rain
You need a poncho
And I got a Mexican girl that give the top-shelf brain
Call her my head honcho
And i got a black girl using that white girl
She higher than the Ozone
And my white girl don't like taking orders
At least while her clothes on
But when she take'em off my nigga that's on me
Then I make her throw it throw it back on me
Then I gas her up pump pump
And make her scream, tell her "Give me 'Oktane' on three!"
Too many women getting lip lip during their trip trip, I drop'em
There's more blessings than problems
But I still get them, When I wanna solve them I say

[Chorus]
Right now I'm trying to get turnt up
So nigga pass that drink
And I don't even smoke, but girl pass that weed
Man I'm trying to get faded
So faded, that it's gonna last a week
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me
Anything goes, yeah that's on me
Gotta pay the consequence in the morning
So anything goes, yeah that's on me
