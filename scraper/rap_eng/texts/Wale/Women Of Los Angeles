[Verse 1: Wale]
Far away from the place that I came from
Yeah, from being a real to the same one
Blue moon, blue moon, we done came up
Yeah, one of the fliest niggas thinking
Tell Apollo to chill and now you flip whatever, shawty
Guess you got a good deal
Wale, aw baby, aw baby
Now the top's coming down, oh top's coming off
Berries on the late night
Or pinks her mouth right
You get that if you been there
These niggas are brazers I be brazy with the brassiere
Man it's been a good year
How did we just get here?
Tables go for too much
When all them Jenners in there
I do too much
Fuck it, we the new wave
Going through them tables like
We Dudley boys in Hooters
Yeah, you ain't playing Wale
'Til I throw a party in the Hills, all of the baes
My name, all of the way
Choppers city, we scrape
Put trill on it and I ain't gotta do it

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
You ain't getting nowhere
You can get up outta here
Acting like you lit when you pull up to the crib
But you ain't with it, they be on that bullshit
Tired of Hollywood bitches
Hanging with they friends
They be tryna come over
Just to take a few pics, only do it for the 'Gram
Tired of Hollywood bitches
Tired of Hollywood bitches
Tired of Hollywood bitches
Tired of Hollywood bitches

[Verse 2: Wale]
Far away from the place that I came from
I seen the real, seen the fake ones
My, my, my women half naked
Probably thinking that a follow make her famous
Shit, I ain't complaining though
Just know that 100k plus ain't for your face and clothes
We know that that tummy tee that you tend to post
Is likely gross but it'll help you pay her notes
She TMZ for sure
And you got the type of T that probably wreck a home
Tell 'em shooting my shots, 2 threesomes in a row
Just the City of Angels this is Halo 4
Rodeo store, make my clothes
I met a lot of real G's, lot of fake models
Yeah, Maxville, I'd like to thank my folks
[?] I salute ya when I pay that too
Had a party, had a zoo
Mixed with Hennypalooza
Of course the body coming through
She with us on the moon
My, my, my Uber on wheels yeah
On my way to dark city, I'mma still shine

[Hook: Eric Bellinger]
You ain't getting nowhere
You can get up outta here
Acting like you lit when you pull up to the crib
But you ain't with it, they be on that bullshit
Tired of Hollywood bitches
Hanging with they friends
They be tryna come over
Just to take a few pics, only do it for the 'Gram
Tired of Hollywood bitches
Tired of Hollywood bitches
Tired of Hollywood bitches
Tired of Hollywood bitches

[Outro: Wale]
How could you love me when you tear me down?
Keep it 100, you bring me down
I tell you I need you, but you tear me down
Keep it 100, will you hold me down?
