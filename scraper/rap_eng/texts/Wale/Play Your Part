You think you're using me like this game's new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry and all the fucking shopping sprees
But that ain't stopping me and I ain't stopping you
See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Just play your part, just play your part
We'll be cool as long as you just play your part
I'm inclined with women who come on they time
She came over here, she came a few times
From crispy futons to Christian Louboutin
Game over, had her shopping in Milan
20 racks, really that's sneaker money
Triple white Ferrari, yeah, that's the Easter bunny
At the Ceaser in Vegas, I put the Visa on it
Now all she do is tell me how she used to love me
I let her decorate the real estate
And I let her spend the half a ticket, give or take
A couple dollars, Harry Winston stone collars
Canary yellow everything, plane chartered
I spoiled her maybe 'cause I adored her
More than fly that girl's a flying saucer
My Mona Lisa painting on the wall came to life
And she said the love of bitches roll the dice
You think you're using me like this game's new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry and all the fucking shopping sprees
But that ain't stopping me and I ain't stopping you
See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Just play your part, just play your part
We'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Uh, I try to love 'em in the physical not literal
She say that she love me but what I'm feeling is minuscule
Understand that Prada lives in her inner soul
So the devil that droves in her got in control
Anne Hathaway and sack chasing, getting got cake up
Though my paper, way thicker than model make up
But y'all wait up, my mind racing, I'm toe slipping
A lot of women is real, some bitches' Robin Givens
I never give 'em no liquid, no pot to piss in
I tend to leave them quite offended if they too dependent
I'm pitching bitches that's dreaming, thinking I'm tricking chicken
I'm simply fucking with bitches that know they whole position
That's real nigga shit, real nigga life
I give my heart to one broad, the others get the pipe
I ain't trying to fight, I ain't trying fuss
I'm trying to fall in money, they trying to fall in love
You think you're using me like this game's new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry and all the fucking shopping sprees
But that ain't stopping me and I ain't stopping you
See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Just play your part, just play your part
We'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Yo, I say how can they compare to you, everything material
Tricking shit for kids and you know I don't need no cereal
You know I was riding and you switched up a gear or two
So I let others hit you on dead, burial, funeral
Check my phone, reacting like it's new to you
Talking what I give and never speak on what I do for you
Cabo to Jamaica, every weekend honeymooning you
Lobster over salmon, I ain't never try tuna you
But now I'm just assuming you living off of hearsay
Treble like the radio 'cause everything was air play
1st class herm ass, Panamera, purp pass
Greed written on her face when I bought her first bag
And I ain't really give a fuck, it was like a nigga rushed
Told my jeweler make her freeze like it was trying to stick her up
She call me Daddy like a nigga Puff
Just play your role, we can live it up
You think you're using me like this game's new to me
But you ain't confusing me
You just want jewelry and all the fucking shopping sprees
But that ain't stopping me and I ain't stopping you
See we'll be cool as long as you just play your part
Just play your part, just play your part
We'll be cool as long as you just play your part
