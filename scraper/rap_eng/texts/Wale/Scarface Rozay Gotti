You niggas shy, copy me all day
Look at you talkin', talkin' all day
Look at you actin', I could put you in castin'
'Cause my nigga will shoot you in the broad ways
Damn, I'm in the spot if you ask for me

Thank God I ain't out here payin' alimony

Havin' no chill at none of the Go-Gos (no, no)
To havin' Lady Gaga in my mitts (sellin', woo)
I do it for niggas that do it for niggas that love it (stunt)
