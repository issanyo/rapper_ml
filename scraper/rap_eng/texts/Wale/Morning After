[Pre-Hook]
I got a pent house in the H Town
Got a condo in the A
Bout to get one out in Cleveland
And every night she gon' say

[Hook]
I brought some liquor for us
To blame it on afterwards
Just like the first time when we fucked
It was fireworks afterwards
It started off with a touch
Then I started kissin' you afterwards
I hope I'm not doin' too much
Cause I get to missin' you afterwards

[Verse 1: Wale]
When I look at that girl
Then I see fireworks
If I get in your world
I'ma show you just how I work
I've been that man full of million
I'm in the land with some real ones
I tip the waiter five hundred dollars
You disappear when the bill comes, hey
Them bitches down, them bitches down, hey did you know?
Be like Ralph yeah pound relationship goals
Them bitches down, them bitches down, hey did you know?
Lookin' like Atlantic records they pay me in gold
They pay me in diamonds, the undateable rhymer
It's funny you can get the cat by being a lion
Liar, fuck it, I'm on another subject
Cause money talk you niggas out of discussion
Wassup

[Hook X2]
I brought some liquor for us
To blame it on afterwards

[Verse 2]
Baby let's not play games, cause you know you wanna stay
You just don't know what to say

Yeah, the bud on the table, we should roll one
I can tell that this liquor got you on one but
Woah, don't you be scared, don't you be shy
Just drink and get high, don't kill the vibe
How you feel about me say it to me
If you love me kiss the air for me
Fuck around take you shoppin' spend some bread on ya
