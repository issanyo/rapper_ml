[Intro]
We find Clark Kent
Mild mannered reporter for the Daily Planet
Walking the streets
From when out of nowhere his super hearing picks up...

[Hook x4: Wale]
What's your set 'bout?
Me and my niggas, we flat out

[Verse 1: Wale]
Told you niggas, "Do not fuck with us"
Hope you niggas do not fuck with us
You caught feelings cause I caught her attention
She caught a flight after I caught a nut, whoa!
Shoutout to my brothers, doe
Quote me too
You goin' make some haters when you love a ho
Higher echelon, God bless my soul
Profit of my infectious flow
Pardon if my vocab ain't good
But the school I was in ain't have no books
These rap niggas never had me shook
I am from a town that is ran by crooks
Get the work from out of town for the money and the power
Niggas steppin' on the powder like it's athlete foot
Know y'all got come get at me first
Little nigga better act your worth
Understand niggas got to be heard
Why the fuck niggas got to be herbs

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trinidad James]
I usually don't do freestyles
Cause my style ain't free, nigga
Fresh from head to toe
I said fly from the feet up
I said, you're looking for a real nigga
Bitch, look up and you'll see us
You lookin' for your bitch, nigga
Don't look up, she with Jesus
I said hallelujah, bitch pop the pussy
So she raise her hands and pop the pussy
I'm with Wale, that's MMG
And that Molly make her go woo
And that money make me show out
My grind wasn't planned out
I'm a real nigga, don't do handouts
My mama crib my stashhouse
In the Yeezy box, nigga oh Lawd
Nigga Ziploc and my Concords
Tell the Feds I don't give a fuck
I'm the man now, I'm the man now
And that's D.C. to the A town
I said D.C. to the A town
And when I flaunt, nigga, that's hands down
But in D.C., they say flat out

[Hook]
