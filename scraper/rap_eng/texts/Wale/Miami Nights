[Intro]
The streets is cold and the beaches is warm
The bitches is everything in between

[Verse 1]
Who would believe this rap shit would have me well off
Type of life a nigga kill or go to jail for
Yeah, can't wait 'til the wheels down
And I'm amazed you clown niggas is still around
Smoking haze all over town like it's allowed
I like my women soft-spoken but the weed loud
Catchin' Heat, floor seats and we all fresh
From court seats to court seats is progress, of course
Tell them other niggas "man up"
Tell LeBron drop fifty unless he playin' us
KOD a couple fifties like a precinct
Straight cognac got a nigga feeling seasick, oh shit
Chef Creole, two-seater
And my watch lookin' like it's all 3PO
2 V's in the street, blowing trees with hoes
And more weed for me, shout out to Meek P.O

[Hook]
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Little more weed, first class seats
First class hoes, we on South Beach
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon

[Verse 2]
We at Mansion, but no cape on
And that ass looking right, what you pay for it
Look, I know you not gay or nothing
But we should find another girl with a tapeworm
I'm in a rental on Collins
Me and my compadres, burning up Barneys
With a model and some limited BVLGARI
My name hold weight and you don't really keep the bar raised
Where dark niggas with dark thoughts and long braids
Is not far from white girls with big bread
And light beers, they slight care, they spring breaking
But right there, they still scheming, they not eating
Knowing they needy as a bitch, they don't need a reason
And when you up in Wet Willies, you ain't even thinking

[Hook]
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Little more weed, first class seats
First class hoes, we on South Beach
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon

[Verse 3]
Ok, black Panamera, dash on a million
It ain't nothin' better than a passionate woman
She graduated top of the class
Carol City or was it the west
Hold up I dont remember really, hold up
Two whips, six tattoos, no kids
And I heard you come alive, when you go to LIV
I ain't trying to be ignorant
But I'm leaving town in a little bit
Miami nights, ain't another one
Until the buzz go away lets have a little fun
Paradise, get away
Thinkin' why it's not South Beach everyday

[Outro: Rick Ross]
We got the jet waitin' on us at the airport homie
We got money to go get baby
Let's get it

[Hook]
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Little more weed, first class seats
First class hoes, we on South Beach
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Little more weed, first class seats
First class hoes, we on South Beach
Miami nights, it was all a dream
If I can get my money right, I'm about to OD
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon
Drinks out, c'mon
