[Intro: Jerry Seinfeld]
The worst thing is when you get comfortable
That's why success is the enemy

[Verse 1]
Lord forgive us, we're sinners
Was poor with the other children
Of course the ills that are less fortunate
Support while they're killing
Graduated from school just to live on their knees
And wonder why the undergrads don't wait for summer for heat
Cause a drug dealer's destiny's still reaching that key
Who are y'all to disagree
While everybody is looking for somethin'
Where the lookouts look out and be like "cuckoo, they comin'"
So it's nothin' when the income is nothin'
And the heat never be on so get that heat from the oven
It's humility, still humanized by these memories
You and I could never eye to eye
Cause my style's like 5 guillotines
I'm more head then cutting off 5 foreheads
10 I seen, the tenacity of my swords edge
Boy.. been built for that
Seen blood get spilt for less
These young bloods like a bad drug
Can't find a cure, take a pill back
Uh, rah rah, D.C. mean "don't come"
A "dick choke" if your ho cum
That was told to me by Curt Bone
And that's fact, shout out Wayne and Corn', too
I ain't slang in the 80's but... I feel the pain y'all went through

[Verse 2]
As a hustler's ambition continues
All them side ways niggas try and do you like Bishop
And I'm sorry if you 30, still purchasing nickels
Cause I'm pushing 30 and the nickel be purchasing Wizards
Like "Ted and Zach, I got the bread, let's go and chat"
Man I made so much off of beanies we can go over cap
El Captain of the rappers songs, get at me dog
And I'm Christ' Dior with a crispy cuff over Paranorms
Stuntin', oh oh, I'm stuntin'
Hobo was the shit and the bus would scoop us at Southern Avenue nigga whatâ€™s up
Revenue up the wazoo cause I hustle
Used to listen to Wasalu
I so was Kick, Pushing the product out DTLR
Pardon me I'm just dwelling
Pursuing the exit from the cesspool we ascended
Uh tell me I ain't successful
