[Intro: Wale]
See I was once told that the heart wants who the heart wants
But I feel your pride your inner thighs
In my eyes would decline such, 'cause
See, I love her cause of the times spent
And I lust you possibly cause of the obvious newness and cluelessness of it
But truthfully shall we didn't even found the real vibe yet
Now, would you rather be the dry non-passionate, half-with-it damn near abstinent primary chick
Or the one I laugh with and casually kiss on the kitty-cat and watch Glow, Black Mirrors and break your back, and let me bask in the aftermath of your black girl magic
Shit, I'm just asking
Damn my phone 4%

[Verse: Wale]
Look, I'm sorry we got us a lil' problem
Monogamy not for the weak hearted (I know)
Told her I'd give her the universe and it hurts
'Cause I opened up, then I got Steve Harvey'd
Hold up, ever had the right love at the wrong time?
Netflix, sex quick, then it's awkward
I know a lot of hoes so I know a lot of lies
So one's cheerin' and the other's sittin' courtside with me
Fear of God drippin', got towel with me
Shawty Gortat sweaty
And I ain't tryna play you like you not a part of me
But that one in pom poms prolly put the paws on you
Girl she reckless
Or maybe I'm just selfish, got
Ol' lady comin' on Monday
Her crazy ass is back Wednesday
Tuesday's for me to rest
Thursday I'm with she, again
Friday I'm with she, and yeah
Saturday I gotta leave her fast because I need it passionately
I bet you'd ask me why don't I leave the past
But back of mind you see we creepin' now
And now you thinkin' how that in a week from now
You'll be she, forget it
Maybe cheaters is sociopaths
Maybe we be cheatin', we ain't heal from a ho in the past
Or maybe I'm a ho and I can show you this hole in my heart
I eat your liquid gold and go home to Golden Corral, you don't know
I'm just tryna say quality over quantity
I'm just tryna say I be tryna live honestly
I'm just tryna say when you be sendin' nudes
I turn to Pookie on New Jack, oh that shit be callin' me

[Verse 1: SZA]
You say you got a girl
How you want me?
How you want me when you got a girl?
The feelin' is reckless
Of knowin' it's selfish
And knowin' I'm desperate
Gettin' all in your love
Fallin' all over love, like
Do it 'til it hurts less
Hanging out the back, all up in your lap
Like is you comin' home?
Is you out with her?
I don't care long as you're here by
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, give me what I want

[Chorus: SZA]
My man is my man is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend

[Verse 2: SZA]
I gotta say I'm in the mood for a little bit more of that
I mean I'm saying what kind of deal, just two days?
I need me at least 'bout four of them
More of them, more of you on me
On us, just tell me you want me, yeah
Monday and I'll be at your door
Ready to take her place
Ready to give you
What you've been missin' on weekdays
What you've been waitin' for
10:30, no later than
Drop them drawers, I know what you want

[Chorus: SZA]
My man is my man is your man
Heard it's her man too
My man is my man is your man
Heard that's her man
Tuesday and Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
I just keep him satisfied through the weekend
You're like 9 to 5, I'm the weekend
Make him lose his mind every weekend
You take Wednesday, Thursday
Then just send him my way
Think I got it covered for the weekend
