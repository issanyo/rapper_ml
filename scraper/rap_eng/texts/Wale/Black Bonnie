[Intro: Wale]
Yeah, the older you get, man, more you appreciate know
The real babes
They don't get offended when you say shit
Ayo, we good?
Let me know when that drop
Yeah Louder
(Hol' up)

[Verse 1: Wale]
Talk to me different, let's come up together
Fuck yo ex nigga if you fuck me better
Let's go to Neiman's, let's go to Lenox
Spend a whole check and run a play to get the next one
Let's create the vibe, let's not take our time
Let's spray paint the Trump Towers, letters, U and I
It's you and I 'til it's suicide
Or 'til the cracker pull us over, ain't no one around, bang
We woke, shawty, protest and party
I know you love nostalgia, I got you Barney's
My bitch witty, her bitches with it
A snake is on the slippers if the snake ever get near me
Please tell me I got you, that's all for intuition
She tell me I got you, I trust her intuition
And I promise to God I follow her intuition so
I tell her I got her with Prada and tuition, hold up

[Chorus: Jacquees & Wale]
Can you be someone, I can't hide my fears, baby
And if they got us on the run, we could still chase our dreams
Black Bonnie, yeah, yeah, do I see my black Bonnie? Yeah
My black, Bonnie, Bonnie, yeah
Bonnie, talk to 'em...

[Verse 2: Wale]
Talk to you different, but never extra
She like the fact I get aggressive but I'm not possessive
Bad but she modest, na-sty and honest
Black Bonnie Parker, black Bonnie Rotten
Cash had the stash but she never snatch a quarter
'Cause loyalty is errything and errything before it
The world never love me 'cause girls only lust
But you a woman, I got no will to show me to trust
Bang, I'm woke, shawty, I'm growin' and maturin'
Of course we not bank robbers, they hate us 'cause we colored
Really should leave the city, really would if you with it
Really could never get lost, I follow what you feelin', yeah
She tell me I got you, I got this intuition
And I tell her my body count ain't nobody business
And I promise to God I follow her intuition so
Graduated from Prada, now Bonnie got the wisdom (black queen shit)

[Chorus: Jacquees]
Can you be someone, I can't hide my fears, baby
And if they got us on the run, we could still chase our dreams
I just need someone (I just need), I can't hide my fears, baby
And if they got us on the run, we could still chase our dreams
Black Bonnie, yeah, yeah, I see, do I see my black Bonnie? Yeah, I see
Do I see my black Bonnie?

[Outro: Wale & Jacquees]
Look, shawty, I know we not felons but I definitely see you as my best friend, confidant and co-defender
Do I see my black Bonnie?
Before that, you deserve every word of this
I see
Real life sentence
Forever my ride or die
Never high, love Clyde
