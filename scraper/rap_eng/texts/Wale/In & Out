[Verse 1: Marcus Canty]
Should I do it?
I be surrounded by so many other girls it'd be hard for me to do it And I don’t wanna do it
Cause if I do it, I might be missing out on something better
So instead I'm tryna keep it moving
Yeah, that’s how I do it

[Pre-Chorus: Marcus Canty]
Cause I be in and out of love, I be in and out of love, in-in-in-in and out of love, I be in and out of love
Yeah, I’m slow to fall in love, but I'm quick to switch it up
Man I just can’t get enough, so I be in and out of, in and out of

[Chorus: Marcus Canty]
I’ve been trying to find a good thing, but it’s never good enough for me
You might think that I’m crazy, it ain’t what it seems
I’m playing a "maybe", so blame it on me
If you try to find a way to my heart, I'll be tryna find a way to leave
So I be in and out of love, in-in-in and out of love, I be in and out of love
And no, they just can’t lock me down
No, they just can’t lock me down
No they just can't, just can't

[Verse 2: Marcus Canty]
Should I do it?
Take a chance, get my heart from the start
And then you’ll see how I do it
Yeah, you know how I do it
But if I do it, I might be missing out on something
So I better keep it moving
Yeah, that’s how I do it

[Chorus: Marcus Canty]
I’ve been trying to find a good thing, but it’s never good enough for me
You might think that I’m crazy, it ain’t what it seems
I’m playing a "maybe", so blame it on me
If you try to find a way to my heart, I'll be tryna find a way to leave
So I be in and out of love, in-in-in and out of love, I be in and out of love
And no, they just can’t lock me down
No, they just can’t lock me down
No they just can't, just can't

[Verse 3: Wale]
And I sort of like her, kind of, sorta, don’t feel her
Maybe she’s just a maybe, no maybe’s can turn to real ones
Maybe that’s just adrenaline, let me give it a second, uh
You ain’t notice a difference, hold up
‘cause how deep is your love?
Actions louder than verbal
And why you’re speaking so much?
And why you’re sucking your teeth?
Cause I can’t be where you are?
Cause I just make you my dinner if I can meet you for lunch
What’s up?

[Chorus: Marcus Canty]
I’ve been trying to find a good thing, but it’s never good enough for me
You might think that I’m crazy, it ain’t what it seems
I’m playing a "maybe", so blame it on me
If you try to find a way to my heart, I'll be tryna find a way to leave
So I be in and out of love, in-in-in and out of love, I be in and out of love
And no, they just can’t lock me down
No, they just can’t lock me down
No they just can't, just can't
