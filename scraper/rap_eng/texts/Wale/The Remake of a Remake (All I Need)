(Intro Wale)
Tawiah - All I Need Chorus

[Wale]
Listen
Shorty I'm here for you any time you need me
For real girl, its me in your world, believe me
Nothin make a man feel better than a woman,(nothing)
Queen wit a crown that be down for whatever
In this life, nothing is forever, my lady
We can make more, make babies
Back when I was nothing, you made a brother feel like he was something(yep)
So now I show you off to the block no fronting
Even when the skies is grey, and my money was low
But now the dough like Kaiser bro
Not relying on the light no more
Cuz ever night the light kisses, she blow the only shot I know
Could make the eyes of the blind perform
I got my wife, so fuck the ring
The ice ain't really nothing to her
And I ain't frontin for her
She know just what it is
And I got mad love to give
You my ni--

Tawiah
(Hook) All I Need

[Verse 2]
-Wale

Yeah
I got a love jones for your body and skin tone
5 minutes alone and I'm already on the you know
Whenever I'm through, you already on the phone
That's why all your lil homies plotting to get me on
But no, head over heels you better get me
Forever all about you like Wrigleys,(woo)
It be true, me for you, that's how it is
I'll be your Noah, you be my Wiz
Im your Mr. and you my Mrs.,
With hugs and kisses, valentine cards and birthday wishes
Please, we avoid Pagan the pace is far more amazing
Than a maze raced by the legless
Won't stray where the hate is
Haters just hate but yet they don't know squat like a leg lift
This is love, nothing else close
Now im signing off, so let my girl go (go)
