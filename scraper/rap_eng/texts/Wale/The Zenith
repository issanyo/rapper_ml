[Intro: Rick Ross & Omarion]
Keep going, keep going
Keep going, keep going (M-M-Maybach Music)
As you listen to my music
I want you to see my point-of-view
Coming from a single parent home
On everything and starting with very little, you know?

[Verse 1: Stalley]
Boy, I'm shinning on these hoes
Triple gold Daytons when I'm riding on these hoes
Got that leather and wood, you know how that story goes
I'm always on my toes when I ain't pushing a wheel
Tires screech and squeal as I bend it to the top
All these haters sit and watch my climb wishing that it stop
I got a crown on my wrist, and a crown on my top
And I got it on alone now they crowding my spot, man
Is this the game that I chose?
Nobody gave me ish so it's nobody I owe
I got that Lee-Roy glow, soul of an assassin
And I'm trying to have me backed in, off up in that corner
But I'm off up in this bitch, gold dangling all over
This WTAPS sweater and it's double MG
I ain't gon' be slept on forever, tell the Sandman to wake 'em up
And help me count this cheddar, not enough hands on me
Eyes on the sparrow and I'm laid up like a pharaoh
Got a couple grand on me, I'm just living my life
They said I would change, I'm just proving 'em right
I was broke before so I'll be broke some more, man that don't sound right
But what it sound like is a good year for me
I used to look at the future and I couldn't bear to see
Me, my momma and my sister was the bears in the tree
Porridge in my bowl, trying to keep hold of my souls
Now I'm the big man to beat
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree
When you start shaking that tree
It's funny how it unfolds when you start shaking that tree
Look at me

[Hook: Omarion]
My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
I'm self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

[Verse 2: Wale]
Wale though, look, yeah, uhh
Gold Rollie, most hoes want to know me
Blowing OG, I never socialize with police
Glock 40, never had it, why I'ma need it?
It'll be them niggas that's looking for it, mama'll be grieving
I ain't thugging, who the fuck is you mean-mugging?
I seen the meanest and toughest niggas, Speedy Gonzales
Don't obsess over money, I'm just eager for comfort
Don't obsess over fame, I just speak to the public
Ain't reached my zenith but all the people see that I'm buzzing
Shout out Seattle but these rappers, they stealing my thunder
Lost a lot of homies, none of 'em even died
I see 'em all the time but jealousy is sabotage
Riding in another drop, ain't talking Enterprise
They tryna see me get diabetes from humble pie
Yeah, I hate to lose more than they love to win
That's the difference 'tween me and them, Ralph, Genius

[Hook: Omarion]
My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
I'm self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
I wake up in the morning, roll up my marijuana
Thinking 'bout tomorrow, I don't wanna be a martyr
Stress that I be under, blame that on my baby momma
Pills that I be popping, wonder will they take me under?
Rusty Mac 11 for these ho niggas with drama
Success in my possession, had you murdered out of karma
All these niggas snitching, witness perjury, Your Honor
Handle my business, tuition for my kids' college
Dope boy scholar, DEA target
1.7 for these VS's on my collar
Born in the projects now I'm known as the hottest
Lay your whole label down, bitch I came for the dollars

[Hook: Omarion]
My back is to the wind, and I just want to win
But nobody ever gave me nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
Looking at the sky, pray that I survive
I'm self-made but I gave you nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing

[Outro: Omarion]
Keep going, keep going
Keep going, keep going
Keep going, keep going
Keep going, keep going (Maybach Music)
Keep going, keep going
Keep going...
