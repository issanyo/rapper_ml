[Intro]
In the face of adversity, I prepared a verse to see
Or hear rather...

[Verse 1]
Destined to win, get respect where I live
My reflection contagious, I’m the messenger here
Making love to the streets, they be lusting for bread
They ain’t sleeping until they know every customer fed
When the city was chocolate, there was death in the air
All I’m hearing is AIDS, I ain’t deaf in my ear
Nah … I ain’t deaf in my ear
But he push them whites in the hood like Ray Edmond was there
Shout out to Kirbo, he told me I would make it
Now me, Tony, G, and Tre got the keys to the nation
Pray for peace with the babies, they a beast in the summer
Of course he fiending for trouble, he had a fiend for a mother
Got no leaders among him, got no loyalty either
Once the police get to cuffing, bet his homie deceive him
See, it’s cold where they be at, on that boat like a pirate
Politicians fucking hookers, why you mad at my ganja?
Kick him out of the city, force them whites who can pay up
Still different ablers killing over what isn’t theirs
Lost my nigga over nothing though
Saeed Alisha I miss you, God bless my brother’s soul

[Chorus]
I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home
And oh, I gotta find my way
Oh I gotta face the day
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home

[Verse 2]
Look, I lost my nigga over nothing though
Saeed Alisha I miss you, god bless my brother’s soul
Ricky is sitting, Baba was sitting
Caught up and slipping for fearing a McDonald’s position
Seen it over a dollar, got him under a flower
Funeral drama, niggas mystery baby mamas
They ain’t really for condoms, I just think that it’s shocking
Got no fear in no officer, they be scared of them doctors
I’m aware that there’s problems, no Obama gon’ stop it
Where there’s minimal conscience and there’s thousands of choppers
I know Howard that college, but uptown has some problems
I done seen embalming fluid ruin a nigga promise
Little women be mommas, little niggas ain’t fathers
Ain’t nobody here leading, it’s way too easy to follow
They knee deep in today, ain’t too fond of tomorrow
Although weight gets you paper, I pray you're weighing your options
This is soulful my nigga, I’m hoping I am giving a hope to my nigga
We just soldiers, my nigga — don’t know you, my nigga, but know you my nigga
This is soulful my nigga, hope that I am giving some hope to my nigga
We just soldiers, my nigga — don’t know you, my nigga, but know you my nigga
Nigga, know you my...
And you know my nigga
Know you my...
Look...

[Chorus]
I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home
And oh, I gotta find my way
Oh I gotta face the day
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home

[Verse 3]
A king's assassination is why most often fear the hell
So needless to say this, leadership is not with a timid sail
I pray these words live and these gimmicks fail and
I pray whenever I’m seen in my city I forever resemble Braille
May your trees be loud, and your queens be proud
May you see your dreams allowed, before you see them from a cloud
May your glass never reach half-empty, may your enemies find the inner-peace before it ever get to beef
I wish you, wealth, health, and pact-free women for yourself and the shit ain’t the best, hope these lyrics help...my nigga

[Chorus]
I feel something change in the weather, and I’m home, home, home
Don’t let it drift away like a feather and I’m home, home, home
And oh, I gotta find my way
Oh I gotta face the day
But oh I can’t stay away, not never, your my home, home, home

[Outro]
See I made it from home, see I made it alone
And all these peasant motherfuckers take shots at the throne
Time after time, again and again
They wanna see a nigga lose but I’m destined to win
