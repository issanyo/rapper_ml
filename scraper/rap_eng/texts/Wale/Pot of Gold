[Verse One]
The root of all evil, is sorta like The Roots new sequel
It's slavery
Know Hailey need a sequence if they need it
Not even
But seemingly believe it though
See it's simply greed, it's such a need to say your broke
Got fixation for that Homer Simpson phrase
Or
Prior to the re, mi, fa, so, la, ti
The optimistic, pro on the lottery
But more than not, and with prolly a whole lot less than the start
It's all for the thought of havin' more than required
A smorgasbord to a dieter
Sure it's hard to get it, but to have it is to fight it
If you fight it then you own it and you have it then it's yours
Huh, a metaphor of course
But when you run your course you should correspond accordingly
Then keep your change like an oink machine
Then never touch it, like your goatee it's grown for years
Asalaam Alaikum

[Hook] [Daniel Merriweather]
It's like I've got you one day, and then you go
You're like the sun and winter, my pot of gold
All of the things you pay for, all the things I sold
So I could find my rainbow, my pot of gold

[Verse Two]
The root of all evil
Now most of us be rootin' for this evil
Kaiser Soze, we never see him
The face is replaced by an image, it happens when you spend it
Ironically it subs like a hero
Sub like zero
Subs like a teacher that ain't even supposed to be here
Let me hear that beat, air
Don't it sound so Premier?
It sound like, somethin' you niggas need to hear
Women be here
They be jockin'
And they Hawkin'
I call them hoes Josh Smith
And it rules everything around them
You ain't gettin' dough, don't even come around them
She needs a lot of goods, she needs some Prada
And her little baby daughter really love them Harry Potter books
This is the root of all evil
The more earned they yearn for, the more lethal
The more small people at your door like please can I receive
Cause I for sure need it
Like I'm supposed to be a machine they all reach in
But I'm all for my poeple
But hold up...I'm dreamin'
