She want me to go up on twitter like
She want me to show her a different life
She want me to go up on Instagram
She wanna be my lover and my biggest fan

You fuckin' with a winner, that's a W
And we on the west side, that's a W

She wanna be my women crush Wednesday

I can fuck you up like an enemy
Real nigga, real bitches really into me
She want me to follow her in real life
Kawasaki on the beach fuckin' up the bike

She want me to show up in the double R
Fuck her on the beach till it's no tomorrow
Richie Rich, young nigga in the double R

She wanna be my girl and my new boo
She wanna be like Nipsey and Nunu
