[Intro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
After you've done done more than they thought you could do
All they do is speculate
Why you dealin' straight
Everything you're supposed to do (this is)

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
The devil want me to settle, I told that nigga never, no
Just know it's another level that they ain't really tellin' y'all
Somebody tried to tell me that the sky's my limit
Knowing that was only just to cloud my vision
Livin' in the city of get down, I laid down
What now?
What now?

[Verse 1: Wale]
They told me I never could, but I soon did
I want my old girl to get a new crib, yeah
I got pride, pride, pride, pride, pride
And I'm beggin' you to let me live
They told me I was doomed to lose
But I'm just too intuitive and too in tune to lose, yeah
I got pride, pride, pride, pride, pride
But the devil wants me to sit with them, yeah
Livin' good and I worry less
Got a full phone that's full of curves and blurry pics
Yeah, I used to work at the carry out
Never give them lettuce, but honey, my
Starter's chicken strip
Phew, when she in my presence, five star villas
Really, this is all no effort
Good energy and prayers all around
Effort, middle finger, what now, nigga's
Droppin' out, F it
F it, reckless, yessir


[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
The devil want me to settle, I told that nigga never, no
Just know it's another level that they ain't really tellin' y'all
Somebody tried to tell me that the sky's my limit
Knowing that was only just to cloud my vision
Livin' in the city of get down, I laid down
What now?
What now?
What now?
What now?

[Bridge: Wale]
Yeah, pride, pride, pride, gone know, my story
I've cut ties with y'all who ain't for me
It's over now, I found my lane, yeah
I got my mind on God and His glory

[Verse 2: Wale]
The vision and ambition
I guess I saw the sign like Ace of Bass, of just petitions
Hold up, my niggas
I really wanna getcha
But really had to figure out that image in the mirror
And the devil is callin', triple sixes in my call log
New phone, who this? No, you won't get him to fall off
Man, the two tone, six-two with the roof off
Get wrong, blue moon, mm-mm
'Cause we a bunch of all-stars
Yeah, used to think that we would all starve
Now, don't use the finger or fork when it's under full stop
Yeah, now I'm lyin', I got rhyming and source
If rap was a palette, I'm the rapper to
Ramadan y'all, sorry
Haters on me no way, They cold feet, I hot step
That's no, Ini Kamoze
And before you get to be poppin'
Probably got to see pay
Before you see the G-5, you'll probably fly Soul Plane
You probably go from oh Lord, to so-so, to okay
But, okay is dope, the ol' Lord, the blank face
What now? Wale


[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
The devil want me to settle, I told that nigga never, no
Just know it's another level that they ain't really tellin' y'all
Somebody tried to tell me that the sky's my limit
Knowing that was only just to cop my vision
Livin' in the city of get down, I laid down
What now?

[Verse 3: Chaz French]
And I done did about everything they said that I wouldn't do
I done played the game, played myself, and played the fool
Would you live without lights, the nicest clothes, and a plate of food?
You gon' take advantage of everything that's in front of you
Nigga, trust me, I know
I done stuck to my plan A from the go
'Cause a plan B's just killin' what ain't meant to be from the go
From always sellin' myself short to damn near sellin' out shows
From no diploma to bein' booked in colleges to perform
Nigga what now, still feel like I ain't got shit but I'm up now
I'm too close, they feel like I'm far away, I'm stuck now
In a high place, I'm the rock, though
I'm a gold mine with no silver spoon
I'm good enough to be the greatest man
But when I get there what's left to prove?
I promise I'm not scared of growth
I promise I'm not scared of growth

[Outro: BJ the Chicago Kid]
The devil want me to settle I told that nigga never no
