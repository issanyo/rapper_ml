[Verse One: Rhymefest & Wale]
Let’s get up, let’s get down
I’m Rhymefest, yes, I’m from Chi-Town
I rep DMV but I be’s from uptown
Up-stock, up-rock, yes, it’s us now
Touché, who say El Che don’t get pu-ssay?
Who down low? That’s you, boy, you gay
And I ain’t in the club buying drinks for grou-pies
I buy ‘em all water like Bobby Boucher
And bitches is boujee, yeah but bitches in groups
They don’t listen to you, they like Tribe, you Lupe
Wale, touché, two shades darker
Y’all not gangstas, y’all not popping
Like soda, rhyme backwards, young Yoda
Die, will you come over?
Hip-hop Lee Iacocca, model bitches stay coked up
Takin' in the white, we sober, I'm doper

[Break]
Ain’t no words to this song
You just dance and hum along
No, there ain’t no words to this song
You just dance and you hum along

[Verse Two: Rhymefest & Wale]
Y’all i stay focused, Lens-Craft poster child
With a flow like no one, now
Homie, y’all’s not blowing, y’all bring
Super-soaker, Billy Ocean, y’all gotta grow up
Watch y’all tone, y’all talking to a grown-up
Young black mogul, concrete jungle
I'm Mowgli, y’all can’t mold me, control what
God has bestowed, we the hope of the culture
Covert, i’m Bruce Lee with no shirt
The Old Bastard with no dirt, don’t play God
It ain’t hard, bitch, i make soul work
You like a gangbanger with no turf, let’s get
Back to the créme de la, Wale, I
See me, myself and I like De La
The King of all blacks, like Nelson Mandela
April 21st is the day you gotta pay by
That’s when we coming with the El Che album
And the Wale album, we make it hot
You better move, nigga, we finna take your spot
And we don’t really give a fuck what you thinking ‘bout
Let’s get back to business, back to business (yup!)
Back to business, back to business (yup!)
Back to business, back to business (yup!)
Ayo Mark, what is this? (yup!)

(now dance!)

[Outro: Rhymefest]
Yeah, get ready for El Che
You know what? We gon’ do it like this
Break it down, come on!
