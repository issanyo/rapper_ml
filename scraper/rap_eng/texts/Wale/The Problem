[Wale] (Spoken Word)
This isn't no gripe but a mere portion of a semi-important life
Far from a complaint, but a mere look at the present showing you the changes that I made
The proverbial lemonade that I made
I made my mistakes, you see life's lemons often times come in a abundance
In conjunction with the pressure that we're under
Underrated some would say
Hated, and some say it's the things I say or how I say em
And I admit, in this race I tend to struggle to relate in words
It's like I'm an alien who alienates by the herd, so as far as being heard
I guess I gotta wait, deprived by the station's eye
Wale, more times than not, am not for whom the air waves
Thank God for the free thinkers, for you keep me in mind
In this state of mind that I'm in, for you keep me in the race with the baton that y'all give
And they hypebeasts, street wear, Versace and Vuitton that I'm in
And really don't matter unless y'all coming with
No days off, may we rip the face of the whole game off
Imma say it to y'all, I'm gonna put my faith in y'all when I don't understand me
They say I'm running hip-hop but I'd rather unify with y'all then stampede
And lastly for everybody who doubted I can't live without you, please
Continue to inspire the fire that is my re-dedication to greatness y'all
Paint A Picture to A.D. to freestyles to famous songs we out 'chere (here)
Unforgettable gestures, unmeasurable effort, to pleasure the masses with impeccable work ethic
Let's get it, I go hard, no days off

[Verse 1: Part 1]
Pain on my face, laying back rolling a J
Feeling like these rap niggas ain't as real as they say
That's why I keep my friends limited, Keep them hoes interested
Resented by the game like I'm Pete Rose in this bitch
Ain't nothing stopping us, tell u what the problem is
I'm on top of my game but these niggas won't acknowledge it
So a nigga hungry as a plastic hippopotamus
So, to stop us better take it in blood like a phlebotomist

[Seinfeld Skit]
You really need some help
But a regular psychiatrist couldn't even help you, you know what I mean?
You need to get involved at the university level, like where Freud studied
And have all those people looking at you and checking up on you
That's the kind of help you need, not the once-a-week for eighty bucks, no
You need a team, a team of psychiatrists working around the clock
You need to go to, like, Vienna or something

[Verse 1: Part 1]

[Verse 1: Part 2]
I walk around understanding the politics
Wish you niggas father understood where the condom was
'06 came, had all kind of buzz
And Isaiah say one day your time will come
Then '09 came, them bad record sales
The silver-lining couldn't find 'em up on any shelf
I'm in the mirror like "this a product of my skills?"
And I feared that my fans say I failed
It's just my fate, let me chill, nah flip
My shit was submarine like, under ship
Look at what I'm up against, scrutiny, criticism
Everybody judging off a single I ain't even pick
Now my eyes Chinese, keep the loud lit
Now I'm taking these pills and I ain't even sick
Ice and Rain, Letter, Center of Attention
I wanted them on my debut, but they ain't wanna listen
You know I love my team, but they couldn't see my vision
Interscope is my fam, so I ain't tryna make no issue
I'm just trying to paint that picture, when I'm rhyming up in this booth
I'ma try to rhyme and get through, I'm documenting the truth
Men lie. Women lie. Numbers won't forsaken
The only album flop is the album niggas hate so
A.D. 2, on the way, let's do this
And God willin' niggas gonna triple up them units
Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin'
If no one's there to listen guess I'll put it in the music
Triple up them units, wisdom is improvin'
I'm heading to Vienna since y'all niggas ain't doin' shit!
