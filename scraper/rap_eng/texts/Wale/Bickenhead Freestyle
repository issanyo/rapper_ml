Do it big (Do it big), you the best (You the best)
I'm just lookin' at your face and your chest (There it go!)
I'm just playin' (I'm just playin'), go low (What you know?)
Real girls get down on the floor, yeah (Woo!)
I got guy-guys in them trenches, guy-guys in them feds
Got ties with the prezi, block a nigga back (Woo!)
Bossed out, really yeah, Saviano brought her back
I'll be honest, Young Folarin taught a lot of niggas swag, woo
Prada comin' back, woo, college I ain't grad
I know some cum laudes, ain't got a dollar but got a dad
Nah, nah, I ain't with it, nah, nah, shit is sad
Thank God for that shit I do, 'cause now I'm in my bag
Pause-pause, stop and think, smoke, shop, drop a G (Smoke!)
Real live, kneel down, chill, y'all still coppin' nicks (Whoa)
I draw up my plans, I'm sketchy with these chicks (Whoa)
I know this Welling girl from Denver one devilish bitch (Aww)
We never convinced (Nah), our trust is conflicted
We step in the name of love, we was Huxtable kids, yeah
Feel sorry for Claire (though) but gotta be real (though)
Would love to believe it, but see me I gotta lil one
For shawty, I'll probably tie you or rob you or kill some'
My shoppin' is like my child that I gotta let Bill go
I'm flexin' 'em still though, I'm flexin' it still though
Tell KOD play KOD, yes, the world is still cold
He facin' 'em hell though, that hatin' be real though
My nigga just came from Naija, a lot of them didn't go
Forever, my man, though, infinity and more
They fingers on Kobe Bryant, I'm tryna be Thanos
So get all your friends ho, one (*snap*) and your clan dies
You niggas is all Hulk, I'm the villain, advanced one
Untouchable double-M, shout out Philly, my mans home
I'm tortured, I'm such a genius, go read up on Van Gogh
I'm thinkin' 'bout land, though, I'm thinkin' 'bout layin' low
Attention ain't all good, better watch what you sayin' Bo
No, mind my business, get back to my bag
Don't know who you root for
But you frontin' do know hold you back
Guap guap, get your chicken, guap guap, make a bag
Got ties with the president, block a nigga bag, yeah
