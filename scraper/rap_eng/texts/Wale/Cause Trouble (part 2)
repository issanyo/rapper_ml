Yeah, Folarin
Wizzy got a dope pair
See my money gon stack

On my way to Ondo state am motivating all the n!ggas that not had much
Hands hands hands up

Bands bands bands up
Hold up, spread something girl girl

Na me dey reign but my style is too sunny ke
Kere ni body but money mi tobi ke
Look at the Benz look at the Rolly ke
Am Young and am getting it, mey le pariwoju
Level me yato buh level won zero ju
Knock won out ni round one
I am the ultimate KWAM ONE!
