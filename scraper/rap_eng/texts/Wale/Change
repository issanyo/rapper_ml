La la la la la la la la la...
La la la la la la la la la...

[Verse 1: Daniel Merriweather]
I saw a dried up river and a rich man
Turning on a garden hose
I see a young man picking up a gun
I guess that's where the money goes, yeah
Am I just as good as a bad man
Sleeping while the rest are dying?
Or am I just as bad as a good man
Saying there's no use of trying?

[Bridge: Daniel Merriweather]
Ooh, tell me do you still believe
Ooh, everything that you read?
Till we learn to get together
And see who we really are

[Hook: Daniel Merriweather]
Ain't nothing gonna change
Ain't nothing gonna change
If nobody's gonna wake up
And start asking who's in charge
Ain't nothing gonna change
Ain't nothing gonna change
Ain't nothing gonna change
La la la la la la la la la...

[Bridge: Wale]
Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singing
Huh singing, okay singing

[Verse 2: Daniel Merriweather]
Some people do it all for money
And some do it all for their love, yeah
Some do it all for the glory
Cause nothing else they're thinking of
I saw a man in a four door truck
Complaining that the price is high
Like a well feed man with a spoon in his hand
Saying who ate all the apple pie, yeah

[Bridge: Daniel Merriweather]
Ooh, tell me do you still believe
Ooh, everything that you read?
Till we learn to get together
And see who we really are

[Hook: Daniel Merriweather]
Ain't nothing gonna change
Ain't nothing gonna change
If nobody's gonna wake up
And start asking who's in charge
Ain't nothing gonna change
Ain't nothing gonna change
Ain't nothing gonna change
La la la la la la la la la...

[Verse 3: Wale]
Uh! If I ain't ready to listen I'm never gonna listen
Most follow intuition while they wishing it would work
And my vision isn't perfect so I will never learn for it
Don't wish for some change like a church worker
Hallelujah, preacher I am not influenced
If I don't donate to your movement am I not improving?
And while the poor kill the poor for a portion
A piece of American society pie
I get high, the munchies I got so bear witness
I got this girl looking at you cause my reps kissing muah!
And I ain't ready to wait when there's dollars on the brain
Why would you expect change?

[Bridge: Daniel Merriweather]
Till we learn to get together
And see who we really are

[Hook: Daniel Merriweather]
Ain't nothing gonna change
Ain't nothing gonna change
If nobody's gonna wake up
And start asking who's in charge
Ain't nothing gonna change
Ain't nothing gonna change
Ain't nothing gonna change, no, no

[Bridge: Wale]
Ain't shit changing but diapers on babies
Get higher than the background singers singing, singing
