You think that you're such a player
I see just what you are made of
I'm not that easy
You should know Dreezy
Make me believe it
Boy I gotta see it
Because you got it like that
I'm s'posed to react
To everything that you sayin'
Since you got it like that
You say you spend racks
Then boy you better be payin'
I'm just sayin'
That you can save it, yeah
Cause you can't afford my love, uh

[Verse 1: Dreezy]
Yeah, run the block to the top, know they finna flop
Takin' shots of Ciroc, walking with a knot
Independent, I might just leave 'em offended
I spin him when he spending and I won't miss him when I finish
And it's pimps in the venue, shrimps on the menu
Where the thugs at?
Throw your sets up if it's in you
All designer on me, you'd never know what I been through
I see you in your rental, call me when you official
You say you got a smart mouth and a mean walk
I say you got a big wallet, throw some G's off
My ladies with they own bag, yeah I see y'all
You a needy bitch, no I wouldn't wanna be y'all
Too many niggas they come at me on the daily
Say let's get dinner but pockets slimmer than Shady
Just cause I flirt with you that don't mean you can date me
I might like him but could never be his lady, yeah

[Hook: Dreezy]

[Verse 2: Wal√©]
I said ooh, is you knowledge proof?
Is you dumb or somethin'?
Oh, really girl, what's your move?
Hey girl, yeah
You ain't sour, you ain't sweet
I beat down blocks and beat down freaks
In sheets, laminating your sheets
In to your lower crevice
I wrestle her straight to sleep
Ooh, hit it like a champion
Ooh, hashtag MC Ham that
Ooh ooh, shawty I'm the best dressed
Got the type of sex turn your man to your best friend

[Hook: Dreezy]

[Verse 3: Dreezy]
I told him, hold up
Back up like you parking
Light skinned or dark skinned
Don't stop me while I'm sparking
I might look expensive but I'm never up for bargain
And I'm looking for a shot caller like he bartend
You wouldn't know a lady if she was in front of you
That's why you always end up with a chick that's under you
That's why I make you grab one or two drinks
I get 'em before you blink then cut 'em off like a summer dew
Yeah, and I swear I got 'em too mad
Now he be all up on my line like, why you do that?
You can't impress me with no money, thought you knew that
Niggas only going for the wave like a durag
Too many people, they come at me on the daily
He take you home and you find out he got a baby
Just cause I flirt with you that don't mean you can date me
I might like him but could never be his lady, yeah

[Outro: Dreezy]
You think that you're such a player
I see just what you are made of
I'm not that easy
You should know Dreezy
Make me believe it
Boy I gotta see it
Because you got it like that
I'm s'posed to react
To everything that you sayin'
Since you got it like that
You say you spend racks
Then boy you better be payin'
I'm just sayin'
That you can save it, yeah
Cause you can't afford my love
My love, my love
Not my love, no, not my love
