[Intro]
I know your heart, I know your vibe
And you know your role, is you down for life
Yeah, you ain't been here but you real as shit
But your body is, a pyramid

[Hook]
I'm sand though, I'm sand though
I'm saying I be that reason, you grow
I'm sand though, I'm sand though
I'm tryna build you up, I'm tryna watch you grow
I'm sand though, I'm sand though
I'm tryna build you up I'm tryna watch you grow
I'm sand though, I'm sand though
I'm tryna build her up so I can watch her grow

[Verse: Wale]
I can hold your hand or get to know your friends
I can show you all that cool shit how to throw that gear on
I can be your back rub, I can be your man look
You can start my wood, I know you tryna see them bands
I won't leave you hanging if you need me
I can be there if you need me
I know you ain't ever been to Egypt
But if I get a chance I can be your trip
El Castillo vida Mexico
Me and she like a bullet in a torpedo
And you're so small but you got a big ego
And you're so small but you got a big ego
Oh my goodness, handle her business
Let her pride go, let a real guy in it
The 6-2 pull up and no I won't tint it
But she got potential, I'm sand I'll build her
Sort of like a pyramid

[Hook]
I'm sand though, I'm sand though
I'm saying I be that reason, you grow
I'm sand though, I'm sand though
I'm tryna build you up, I'm tryna watch you grow
I'm sand though, I'm sand though
I'm tryna build you up I'm tryna watch you grow
I'm sand though, I'm sand though
I'm tryna build her up so I can watch her grow
