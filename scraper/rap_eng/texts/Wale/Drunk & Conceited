Wale, the diaries of a lexicon legend
This shit the same walk that got me out these boxes
The same shit

I'm too grown to fuck with a bitch who ain't live yet
From cold nights in DC to summers on sunset

[Hook]
Wassup? I don't really need ya, I just want ya
See you got me fucked up, know when I fuck with you hard
What you gon' play your cards yeah?
Cause I fuck with you hard, but you won't play my heart
Okay now wassup? I don't really need ya, I just want ya

[Verse 1]
Shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty

It's complicated, complicated
She always come, always go, yeah
Drunk as fuck, I'm tryna stroke or something
Might sober up and back up on the money
Shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty, shawty
I'm on the road, yeah
Sex the weapon
Murdered the lil cat and number of orgasms
Wanted this 187
Who was killing the pussy? Who will fuck you to sleep?
Who would shout out the blessing, only once, I ain't two
When you needed a feeling, who put the vibe on you?
Mandingo, she ain't gon' see this what I do
And her thighs feeling like a whole tribe in you
Oh girl, wassup?
The Uber kicked me out, said I was too fucked up
And I'm stranded I don't trust no one but you
I mean I do got like a few
Matter fact, FaceTime me right quick
Never mind, your texts ain't blue

And I ain't called you lately
But I been drinking
Now where the fuck is your car?
Drunk and conceited
