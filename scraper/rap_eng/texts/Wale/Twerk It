[Hook: TY Dolla Sign]
Bend it over for daddy
Gon' look back at it
Don't hide that pussy
Oh you know I like it when you
Twerk it on dick, twerk it on dick
Girl twerk it on dick, girl twerk it on dick
Twerk it on dick, gon' twerk it on dick
Oh twerk it on dick, gon' twerk it on dick
Girl twerk it on dick, twerk on dick
Gon' twerk it on dick

[Verse 1:Project Pat]
I like the way that booby jump like a brawl
I like the way you walk that ass like a dog
I like the way you keepin'  that pussy on call
You like the way I spend that money at the mall
Corn bread ass, soft like Jiffy
Got my dick hard like the knobs on her titties
Only chase money, we ain't chasin' no kitten
But I work that mouth out, drop down gimme fifty
Sippin' black remy, riding in black Porsche's
Kiki and Becky, black in white fortress
Tonight they be mine, tomorrow they yours
Loud in my blunt, kick hard like horses

[Hook: TY Dolla Sign]
Bend it over for daddy
Gon' look back at it
Don't hide that pussy
Oh you know I like it when you
Twerk it on dick, twerk it on dick
Girl twerk it on dick, girl twerk it on dick
Twerk it on dick, gon' twerk it on dick
Oh twerk it on dick, gon' twerk it on dick
Girl twerk it on dick, twerk on dick
Gon' twerk it on dick

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
You a good girl, hell nah
Scared of the hood girl, hell nah
Scared to get high girl, hell nah
On that dick, scared to ride girl, hell nah
Scared of a fast car, hell nah
Like a Nascar, hell nah
You want a broke nigga, hell nah
Shit if you broke, what you doing hell for
I be be throwing hella money on these bitches
Makin' it rain, you niggas looking hella sunny little bitches
Rich niggas wearing, fuck niggas hate
Go and throw it on me, it'll go away

[Hook: TY Dolla Sign]
Bend it over for daddy
Gon' look back at it
Don't hide that pussy
Oh you know I like it when you
Twerk it on dick, twerk it on dick
Girl twerk it on dick, girl twerk it on dick

Oh twerk it on dick, gon' twerk it on dick
Girl twerk it on dick, twerk on dick

[Verse 3: Wale]

Working with a grip

Oh c'mere you pretty little chick
I'ma get inside and work, like a surgeon in this bitch
Dude she throw that thang in the boot
[?]
Now lemme take a look it in your pack
This is a googly moogly that thang is juicy
Suicide pullin' up, who is y'all on the bus
Super high got them inside the whole crowd rolling up
Who am I Olubowale
Like I'm part lamb party
Yo I'm outta here

[Hook: TY Dolla Sign]
