[Hook: Fun]
The city outside is nothing but a flicker now
You see our friends to bed, you turn out the lights
I start to think youâ€™ll make a beautiful mother, I
I like to think I have everything I want from this life

[Verse 1: Wale]
My life is your amusement, therapy is music
I'm a carousel of kerosine, don't you get this dude lit
Illuminati nah, I dropped my britches down
I will illuminate the sky, full moon though
June coming, due weather, El Diablo
But always seven hallelujas when I meet my mama
I ain't with the talking, I call them seven digits
How they come up quicker than prisoners getting conjugal visits
As God as my witness I'mma talk to these niggas
It's not a problem, partner, get you some guap, but they listen
And all of us gifted, nigga, all of us gifted
I just toss syllables about as hard as Harvard admission
Know that lyric is that Zuckerberg though
Is that fuck the world riding algorithm with that flow
About a half a ticket sold, glad to give you niggas hope
Still it's hardly number one like I am passing kidney stones
Hold up, now it's coming to subliminals
Cause all their women feel me leaving phlegm upon my genitals
Getting dollars, don't get shot up, you caught up Interscope
They say the music business can lure a 100% of you, that's what's up
Wonder why I'm stingy with love
I'd rather give up a kidney, a bone marrow than trust
Alone drunk as a fuck, huh, need me a blunt, huh
Need me some girls, that's word to Lena and Judd, I'm high

[Hook: Fun]
And, for once there is nothing up my sleeve
Just some scars from a life that used to trouble me
I used to run at first sight of the sun
Now I lay here waiting for you to wake up
