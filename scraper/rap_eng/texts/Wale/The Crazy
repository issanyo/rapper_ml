Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm out of my mind with this tape
Rap is out of shape, so I just wanna taper
And then give it a shape up
My flow is a razor's edge Chico

How can I convey this
How can I portray this
How can I relate this image with the same list of lyrics so I changed up
From fear of the same stuff, I give them the tailor
Made from the brain of me, most genius
Always I appreciate it, when they leave us
No one give a damn when they breathe in the least bit
When they try to teach us, we be in the bleachers
When they are deceased every player turn blue-chip
Same thing with this music
Those who've grown immune to it make they own taste to produce it
Either in the visual, lyrical or audio
Clothing line struggle til the proper nigga on it
But who on it first usually gets laughed at and sassed
And they say I'm over heads cuz they don't understand... that

Do you think I'm crazy, crazy, crazy
Do you think I'm crazy, crazy, crazy

I swear they think I'm crazy
Too much percussion and bass when I take beats
God gave me wisdom and you disbelievers atheists
While I'm making history
Like I drew attemtped, curriculum, get me
Ankh ancient like the pharaoh
Lil' more dinero
Denim front been still kickin' ten zero
Yeah, I am crazy, hoppin' off the wall like Vega
They vaguely decipher my language
Outta my mind, come and chase me
Rich off of Grammer like I'm managing Frasier, Cheers
Psycho, maestro, orchestrate the life with the right flow
Right flows down and they might go nice
A low life's plight
I give up my light like an interracial couple wit a child
I'm fuckin' paramount, I hope they understand that
Light over heads mean I'm right where they head is
Pause, epiphany
Y'all, ironically, normal, and Nermal, from Garfield, you're kitten me

Do you think I'm crazy
Do you think I'm crazy

It's obvious I'm crazy
Besides Black Thought, Ye and Jay-Z
Told you Camp Lo was my favorite
They was on that Mase shit
I was on my sway shit
How can I persuade more heads to hear this great shit
I just stop trying to
Had to get my mind on what I do
They would not oblige to a mind who inclined or flying over climbers
Gliding through the skies as the slow minds wander
Walking on the ground
An iPod mind to you Walkman guys
But I apologize for not walking you around
Cuz I acknowledge I am far more knowledge
They are more garbage and I am so Nasir
Yeah, and I ain't saying that I'm Nas here
I'm just saying rap's dead when I'm not here
Bring it back, I ain't saying that I'm Nas here
I'm just saying rap's dead when I'm not here
