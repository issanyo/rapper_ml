Here ye here ye
Let's toast
Let's celebrate life, let's celebrate wealth, and bypass plight, for the night
Drinks up

Back like I never ever left in the first
Wale Ovechkin, the best on the earth, breath breath full of purp
A legend out here, and I'm ending careers by the end of my year
Two horse when you mention my gear, lil low low lil showboat, nigga since MoCo
Ros√© for the hoes in the V.I, P-P.I, gotta do 'em all like T.I
Whatever You Like, it's whatever tonight
I might give you the pipe unless you pedaling bikes
I mean cycling
I was liking it
Hit me up in a couple days, we can try again
I need henny on the rock, my Queen top notch
And I keep a fly girl like Jenny from the block
Got HU women Frostburg Women
Throw a round game, Strasburg pitching
Tonight no pitchers, everything's straight
And we gonnna toast up for the niggas that hate
And we gonna drink dark, we gonna take it to they face
And I got them gold bottles, first place
No medal here, I'm well aware
Y'all Mario brothers, I'm Metal Gear
I don't ever fear nothing, I'm forever here
Hands up DJ, let let 'em hear

[Hook]
If you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
(Repeat)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- champagne for the- champagne for the (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- champagne for the- champagne for the (HOES)

I'm faded and ya'll ain't it
I'm Ninja Gaiden and ya'll lil Jayden
It's Roc Nation, this my team
Go and dis my team then I ditch ya'll lay in
Hey man ya'll just fakin, and cheap hoes love a nigga like H&M
Rich hoes love a nigga like Ray-Bans
I don't know what ya'll heard, but Hip Hop ain't dead
I could change a broad's life in about an hour
I turn ducks into bucks- Luke Ridnour
Ya'll had your run, don't ruin ours
Watch a young nigga operate Doogie Howser
I don't really like the Hollywood scene
The dudes all fake and the girls are bulimic
The drinks too weak, what the fuck is a Bellini?
But you would never think if you seen it on TV
DMV what I rep, all GP
I make it rain Sean Kemp, GP
I make words come alive, GP
Create life with the beats, Alicia Keys
'fore we do the unthinkable
I'm gonna need a tree, a freak, and a drink or two
Whatchu thinkin boo?
Whatchu want love?
Fuck a cold sore, getcha getcha own cup

[Hook]
If you're not really here
Then the stars don't even matter
I wanna be next to you
Black and gold, black and gold, black and gold
(Repeat)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- champagne for the- champagne for the (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- (HOES)
Henny for my niggas, champagne for the- champagne for the- champagne for the (HOES)
