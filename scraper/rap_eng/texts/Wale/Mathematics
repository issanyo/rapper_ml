[Intro]
Let's fuck this jawn up
It's simple mathematics
100, 50, none
Blue moon
Hey, look

[Chorus]
Keep this shit 100 with the squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah
Keep it 100 with squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah

[Verse 1]
Made me a grip off a show
Take me some bitches and go
Olivier made the jeans
Coco Chanel made the coat
Playboy, I always been ready
Skinny but always been heavy
Gave away all my old bitches
Gave away all my Giuseppe's
Keep it 100 with Ross
Keep it 100 with Meek
Keep me a number to call
Hide that shit like the 300 movie
I get that love in DC
Show love or be humbled in peace
Grown up, didn't jugg in the streets
Still I got just what the customer's need, yeah

[Chorus]
Keep this shit 100 with the squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah
Keep it 100 with squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah

[Verse 2]
Baby, I been on the road
Lately been fellin' so bored
I put trust in a fuck nigga once
Now he don't make decisions no more
That's why I stick to the code
Niggas ain't shit with that flow
I'm highly respected 'cause me and
No Credit be in here until six in the morn'
I got some niggas that's gone, yeah
I got some niggas that's gone, yeah
I got some niggas that live in the sky
And some here but don't feel 'em no more
And used to cut niggas off
I guess it's the price of a boss
Stressin' all night and now I got my shit tight
Got more bags tight and 'em swipin' ass broads, yeah

[Chorus]
Keep this shit 100 with the squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah
Keep it 100 with squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah

[Verse 3]
Catch me a flight, go abroad (Yeah)
Catch me a flight with your broad (Mmm)
Not even my type but need somethin' that nice
So I bet you might Skype with that broad
Sometimes I be trifling y'all
Sometimes I enlighten with thought
I guess I'm a type of swing pimping like Ken
Or Rob Hill when I'm writin' these songs
Keep it a hunnid with squad
Keep it it fifty with hoes
Need me like thirty to walk through
Need me like 60 a show, fuck it
Need me like 80 a show (Damn)
Fuck it, a hunnid a show
Need me that money when jefe pull up or call
Fuck it, don't hit me no more (Don't hit me, don't)
Keep it a hunnid with squad
And my moons right under my guard
Chasin' his monies and loan
Ain't been prayin' as much and I'm sorry (Amen)
We in a jungle from now
When you rich, they gon' fuck with you now
Uncle Sam in them pockets, my partner just got off
So that man might give me a pound, yeah

[Chorus]
Keep this shit 100 with the squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah
Keep it 100 with squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah
Keep this shit 100 with the squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah
Keep it 100 with squad
Playing at 50 with hoes
And I got nothing for anyone fronting
It's simple, I stick to the code, yeah
