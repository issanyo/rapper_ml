[Intro: Wale]

[Hook: Wale]

Look ma' no hands

I sling that wood I just nun-chuck 'em

Look ma' no hands
I think I deserve a chance
I'm a bad muh'fucka'

[Verse 1: Chevralet]

It's Diep, Quang, Ralph, Slay
D.j. Suave & Chevralet
We V.I.P. at Mo's Chalet
Drinkin' free & burnin' haze

It's ho's in here with ass for days
Bitches swingin' different ways
When Suave let the record play
They hit the floor with no delay

Some on the floor on the walls
It's one on me one on my dog
This one ho' dancing with no draws
Her friend's behind her gettin' off

We ditchin' chicks, switchin' off
Niggas cuffin', fuck the law
I can't lie I want 'em all
Gotta' make my pick by 3 o'clock

And I like how she dance
Oh my damn I'm in a trance
Goin' ham Right in front of her man
In a sandwich with her friend

If that's your girl better hold on to it
I'll have her smokin' water sippin' that fluid
I think I can little engine could
And if I can't Wale gon' do it

[Hook: Wale]

[Verse 2: Chevralet]

I'm Chevralet S-S
"SS" stands for stupid swagger
Got more pull than Comet, Cupid
Vixen, Blitzen, Donner, Dasher
You can cuff her, don't matter
I'll uncuff her, detach her
Then I Mario, Luigi
Yosh, Bowser, super smasher

You can ask her how I am
Why do you think that you're her
I smash & dash, cram & scram
WHAM! BAM! thank you ma'am
No I never eat the clam
I get more head than a ram
Its Chevralet no Sam I am
But ho' I go green eggs & ham

Chev-ra-let go away
That's what all my haters say
Cause every time I come around
Them ho's turn into stowaways
You C.I.A. she M.I.A
O-N-M-Y-D-I-C-K
I glove up 'fore I touch her
Then I treat her like a throw away

Like a gun I bust her
Double edge sword either way I cut her
Sling that wood I Louisville slug her
I'm a bad motherfucker

If that's your girl better hold on to it
I'll have her smokin' water sippin' that fluid
I think I can little engine could
And if I can't Wale gon' do it
