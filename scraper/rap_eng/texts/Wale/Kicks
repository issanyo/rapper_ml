[Hook]
Bet you never seen a pair
Bet you never seen a pair
Bet you never seen a pair of kicks like mine

[Verse 1]
Well they ain't fly like me (no)
Focus on the 3
Wardrobe looking mean
You should see the way I lean Joe
But they don't lean tho, he ain't never seen those
I stunt easier than Mark Price free throws
We gon' cop, un-deadstock
Half-size smaller so I got church socks on
Yeah, is it the way I flow
My Dela clothes or my De La Souls
I'm so much a solehead
I go out and turn heads south
They be lookin' at my toe game
Every time I'm out, the block get wild
Got Phil Knight's number in my speed dial (I'm fresh)
I find it hard to shake broads
So I skip hoes like a Harlem lace job
Sorry to inform y'all, I don't relate to all
You niggas wear fake X stars on Bapestas

[Hook x2]

Man, you ain't fly, you ain't stunting
Them shoes ain't nothing
Keep it coming with the kicks
Get sick, y'all love it
Y'all buggin', y'all dug it, I'm sitting on the sky, and I
BET YA NEVER SEEN A PAIR OF KICKS LIKE MINE

[Verse 2]
Of those kicks, I got an onslaught
Check the way I rock mines
Star like Bape
I am literally PonDon
Nah, nah I don't really rock mine
These one time hits, call them bitches Rahman's
A Rottweiler, wildin' on the scene
Fifteen for the Tee, 350 for the jeans
450 on the sneaks, two beans on the bling
No bling, that's a rubber band
You talkin' to a G here
Cheer for the green pack, I'm a Cheesehead
Ray guns on, young make police scared
Pradas on a Monday, Dunks on a Tuesday
J's on a Wednesday, mix it up the whole week
Hoes be on me, OG's on me
No G R-Co-JP only
And you ain't hip lil' nigga, go read a book or something
Still shop on Eastbay, please man the hook'll tell em

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Wale Knievel, believe the dumb stunna
1-900 sneaker dead, keep em comin'
Airmax crazy, whole lotta flavors
Flight Club, New York, and DC's major
We don't wear dunks for the hype
We only wear fits if the fit feel right
And I'm legit with it, I ain't even really trippin'
Won't find me in Vans cause they look like slippers - pimpin'
Chip & Pepper denim, got my Tiffany's over them
OG penny's, I collected all four of 'em
What up Greg Street, throw a youngin' bout 4 of 'em
Ya boy McFly, I should ride in a Delorean
Riding with my Laser 4 Jordans before you ordered 'em
I'm a quick strike away, flyer than all of em
Guaranteed the audience'll call it how I call it
I ain't even gotta say it, you can hear it in the chorus

[Outro]
Bet you never seen a pair
Bet you never seen a pair
Bet you never seen a pair of kicks like mine
Wipe 'em off, footwork
Fresh, so fresh
Stop, wipe 'em off, footwork
Fresh, so fresh
Man you ain't fly, you ain't stuntin'
Them shoes ain't nothin'
Keep it comin' with the kicks
Get sick, y'all love it
Y'all (fresh)
Bet you never seen a pair of kicks like mine
