[Verse 1 & 2 - Rick Ross]

[Verse 3 - Wale]
Ok, Trick who? Lace what?
You know Wale don't
I take tokes while you little niggas take notes
I keep a broad beside me while I skate coast
Fuck "Grey's Anatomy" I'm getting Sasha Grey throat
I nevermind a mind beyond vagina
Riding with some bitches, getting high as Brittney Griner
On 95 my lady light it for me
J big as a muffler, we puff that Meineke weed
As I light one for Ill Will
Will walking on my heart, wish you was still there
Reminiscing on my niggas looking down on me
A little loud
I can here you real loud, homie
