[Intro]
There is she
Effortlessly so stunning
Baby, can we create something?
Don't leave me wandering

[Chorus]
'Cause we're so effortless, girl
The way we bubble so effortless
That's why I love you
You got me shook up, shook up, shook up, shook down of your loving
So effortless, so effortless

[Verse 1]
Folarin, hol' up
Never trust a big butt and a smile
I been sippin' poison that's brown
I've been here, but I've been low key
Can't nobody say they've seen me around
I got circumstances that got my circumference workin' backwards
My circle's small as a barber shop in a Rasta mansion
Lockin' with you as I unravel the possibilities
When not with you I just miss your body, I got your energy
Gucci startin' to bore you ain't it
You rather patience and conversation
She mature, but she still a baby
'Cause she get a check but still check my pages

[Chorus]
'Cause we're so effortless, girl (with your immature ass)
The way we bubble so effortless
That's why I love you
You got me shook up, shook up, shook up, shook down of your loving
So effortless, so effortless

[Verse 2]
Would you rather me put in work or be shy, baby?
Would you rather me say you're perfect and lie, baby?
Write my name up in cursive between your thighs baby
Would you rather me thirsty and you dehydrated?
I got the feelin' I'm catchin' feelings I can't fade 'em
Casual love is innocent but to care is fatal, uh
It's embarrassing carin' for some people
The heart you wear that's on your sleeve is there to mislead you, uh
I know I'm petty and immature and I know
I've been hurt before shouldn't be the source of my cold heart
Maybe shawty could be the first
To show me how to love on a level where effort isn't work

[Chorus]
'Cause we're so effortless, girl
The way we bubble so effortless
That's why I love you
You got me shook up, shook up, shook up, shook down of your loving
So effortless, so effortless

[Bridge]
I want it as is, such a natural beauty
Are you even real?
Are you doin' this to me?
You're my favorite thrill
And there is no rush
But I think the universe is speaking to us

[Chorus]
'Cause we're so effortless, girl (uh, right)
The way we bubble so effortless (we at West Lake of the late night)
That's why I love you ( I hit this drink so hard I think I just seen Mike)
You got me shook up, shook up, shook up, shook down of your loving
So effortless, so effortless

She can do this with no effort
