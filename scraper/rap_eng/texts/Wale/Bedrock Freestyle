She got that good good
She Michael Jackson bad
So hit me with them cups, Ron Artest Stepen Jackson, yea

And I don't have to ask
Shorty gon' give it to me
And now we high
I got more green than Grounds-keeper Willie

Oh girl now don't be silly
Lets come up to my city
They ask about me
My kick game be making Fifa envy
D.C. PG is with me see that Bentley that ain't mine
If out of line
Had a woman bust it taking that matter right

I be getting scratched
So I must ask now wheres the calamine
And pussy is the shit but that don't mean I'm finna pamper ya'll
Damn I'm fried
And I'm gone
She alright?
Oh, she gone?
Please sugar don't come alone
And don't you bring your camera phone

I believe in privacy
I believe in honesty
They lying on they jimmy
On they twitter writing novels, see

I'm modest, and humble
My polo got no logos
Mr. Pacquiao, I'm packing
Your vagina shall be Cotto

I can party in 90210
Solo or a go-go
Need a girl whos tryin' to ball
Cause I don't know Rebecca Lobo

You is loafing. No B.S.ing
Second guessing? Never me
Never agree with that message
They say nothings ever free

Shit cause I'm an F-ing thief
Pop a pill
Get some trees
Get a glass and put Chris on, yea
Just like Mr. Cee

No big baby
So give it baby
I'm Vera Wang-in
No isn't baby

Don't mean to be impatient
But you should be in pageants
I got more hoes than Tiger
Word to Sagat

I got that ganja itch
Loud addition purple patch
And bring some roll up
Bring a movie
Bring your friend
I got the Magnums
Bring some cheetos
Bring some gum
And when you done I'll call that cab
And if you pay for that yourself
I promise I'mma call you back

All you bad
And all you cute
And I'm in awe
From all you do

But if I went and convolute
Do you think I would have called it to

No boo
Audible
Think I need another play
Let me call that hotel
She can't know where my mother stay

Now I'm straight
Lets consummate
Your girlfriend want to follow
She said kiss me on my lips if you wanna know how her vagina tastes

Ok, let me do it
Guess I see it's my turn
Ya'll wife and white knight her
I pipe in and one night her
Heart break
I serve
To MCs that don't rhyme good

They think they bring that pain
Well I am percaset and vicodine
You work the bitch
I'm ballin
Florence something foreign
You get close but no cigar
Like the footballers from new orleans
I'm a manning
I'm a mansions
Or the Hamptons
We just went there
Put that lamp in
I'm in the middle of a bad bitch sandwich, yea
And they all lettuce
You all ketchup
We countin all this feta (cheese)
This time we all relish

And ya'll don't know no beef
This smourgus board is portabella
All I bump is Rockefeller
Rock nation

D.C., We propelling
You know I am not gon stop
I don't need no single
Like I'm only serving 20 rocks

No change
I won't Change
Fat Trel
No bass
Three six eight
Whats up to boarders is we not playin
Go head
Break a leg
Do what you must do
But Ym and us is close like mr. Fiji in Hiku

Ya'll ain't fly
Ya'll ain't cool
Got shit dropped out, don't recoup
And I don't make no bed rock
I turn that mattress to a pool, Biotch
