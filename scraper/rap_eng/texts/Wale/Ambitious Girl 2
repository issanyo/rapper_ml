Consider this my reiteration
Miss I want to read into your nature
Like the deepest of liter-ature
Miss I'm trynna to be in your space without being in the way of your dreams and education
Let me say this the realest bitch in the room
Her living situation ain't too good, so her living begins in June
Miss couldn't get them Jimmy Choos cause tuition is due
Miss wherever you S-A-T I want to A-C-T like I want to get into you, no particular school
Miss made some new friends stepping with crews
Miss aka Miss Crimson and Cream, Miss Unaffiliated
But whatever it is baby hope you pledge to your dreams, forever my queen

Go girl, Go girl
Look, I'm still talking to you baby
You like your school but you're sick of Sally Maybes
Great sex, she ain't slept, she can't rest tomorrows that big test
Two of her friends strip she never judge them though
She insecure with her body so she like fuck it though
I put you on that pedestal
Shorty I'm just saying that your effort makes you edible
That's something they won't ever know
Look it something they can't ever see
Shorty you supercede anything they'll ever be
Go ahead and study shorty, hit me when you finish up
It's never late, we celebrate soon as your papers done
Shout to them girls in the club that don't fuck with they professors
Yessir, lets have a toast for the girls
That you offer them ones but they ain't let you

I love your ambition
Ambitious girl, ambitious girl, ambitious...so ambitious
Ambitious girl, Ambitious girl, ambitious...so ambitious

Okay
Shout out to them 4.0's and them 1.5s that don't mind and say fuck it, I tried
It's nothing to deny for having such a mind, I'll be having y'all in mind
It's something you can ride too
Dress up and get fly too
It's something you provide that make me want to get inside you
Look, ambition will define you
You don't worry about them bitches you just doing what they'd like too
And I'd like to serenade you for every day you
Chasing your dreams instead of chasing a niggas paper
And God blessed me with a lot of patience
But I ain't had none in a while I need your aspirations
