[Intro: Wale]
Turn me.. up, wah, wah-wah, wah
Turn that up a little bit, Dre
Let's have a toast, one time can you put the deuce up for the triple black niggas that put forth so much foresight on this forthcoming, fifth album
Nigga this style is fantastic, that's why the young lasses ask for us with such passion

[Chorus: Rotimi]
Thank God
I said thank God
I said thank God, we don't do what we used to do no more
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Thank God
I said thank God
I said thank God, we don't do what we used to do no more
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Refrain: Wale]
I tell my enemies, neighbor, I really pray that you don't fall, yeah
I tell my enemies, I really pray that you don't fall
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
So they can watch me ball

[Verse 1: Wale]
Ball on a nigga, ball on a nigga
Too much sauce on a nigga, sauce on a nigga
Fuck 'em all lil' nigga, ya lil' nigga
Yeah-yeah, watch me ball (Wale, yo, look)
SLP, that may not be out for months
If they want a feature, they don't reach out for months
I may not be no type of street artist
See honestly, I decieve and to be populized
I'm tryna get my daughter five McLaren
That feminist side come around when Zyla there
Shh, loud in here, quiet girl
Kiss the baby goodnight and step out in riot gear
The city of light, city of light when the moon out
Criminal side, they say Iâ€™m dark Miss Luna
Heavenly God, I pray the squad stay too up
And Satan stay with y'all 'cause the fear of God too much
J Lorenzo, a couple bands, oh, yeah
Couple haters, shout out to Enzo, yeah
It's unbelievable what I've been through
Gave niggas handouts, they become a handful
What it do? What it do?
Penny phones come up blue
Sean John threw a bag so Folarin back coupe
Back to back, triple black Maybach, mad room
Bad bitch come around, turn the cat to Katsu, yeah
It's too late, all you niggas two-faced
All you'll ever be good at is rollin' weed and 2K
Or maybe Madden and FIFA, that's why I brag when I see ya
If my bag ain't a bag, at least my integrity straight, wait

[Chorus: Rotimi]
Thank God
I said thank God
I said thank God, we don't do what we used to do no more!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Thank God
I said thank God
I said thank God, we don't do what we used to do no more!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Refrain: Wale]
I tell my enemies, neighbor, I really pray that you don't fall, yeah
I tell my enemies, I really pray that you don't fall
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah
So they can watch me ball
