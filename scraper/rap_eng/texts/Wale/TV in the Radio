[Verse 1: Wale]
I kick it, I kick it like Olindo
I wear my Nike Boots and Gucci, I don't wear no Timbo
I kick it any tempo, I'm lifted off the indo
I'm popping champagne, drinking till I'm jumping out the window
Heh, if the autotune's gone
Bet they all will tune in, so I'ma do it bigger than
An Audemar wrist watch, hip-hop's slackin'
Why they getting Grammys when these niggas is actin'
They phony, should get Tonys for the things that they be yappin'
It's utterly bologna, so I'm Muslim to these rappers
Fuck yappin', they lucky we don't clap 'em
And have them peoples leakin' like they CD isn't mastered
CD is in plastic, these niggas is has-beens
We ain't makin' friends while these niggas is Anistons
Dig, these niggas is fake joe
Hip-hop need a wake-up, we the fuckin' clock radios

[Chorus: K'naan]
We original officially the most original
If we wasn't so original, then we'd be criminal
Wale and K'naan, they don't know is there radio
How the hell did they fit the TV in the radio?

[Verse 2: Wale]
They told me go in; no problem, I'ma go in
Ain't shy away from drama, I ain't run away from no man
And there ain't been no buster, prepared for you suckers
Then they'll play with Mario Brothers when it was Duck Hunt
That's words to my mama, since I wasn't a starter
A nigga been a star before I forfeited my scholar-
Ship, didn't finish college, shit wasn't a problem
Shit, when homecoming is here I'm who they call up
So I still be on that yard with a Philly of that Marley
From the city, the Philly women willing to menage
Though, I put 'em on pause since Manilli been involved
Though, everybody's on me like the Milli beat partner
I'm from the D-Dot where we not no beatboxers
We talkin' B blockers keep us with deep pockets
See not no fad or no internet phenom
But he be's on that web like he be's with Pete Parker
Me I'm naija and my partner's Somalian
K'naan and my buzz is too big like Kamala
Ballin', Folarin so goddamn hard
Fat rhymes every time, bitch, Roseanne bars
Wale

[Chorus: K'naan]
We original officially the most original
If we wasn't so original, then we'd be criminal
Wale and K'naan, they don't know is there radio
How the hell did they fit the TV in the radio?

[Verse 3: K'naan]
I don't know why the industry wanna keep me a secret
And Wale been tellin' other rappers take a deep breath
And don't perform after him or you might regret
I guess they didn't get the memo or the leaflet
You know if you was harder than me then you'd be lead
And if you had more street cred then you'd be dead
And I'm Somali so I guess I'm just tryna eat bread
Fuckin' with my people well that's called the Heath Ledge
Needless to say I turn rap beef to piglets
Make you speechless, make you bloody, make you teethless
Then the blood drip on the floor poison pieces
I been on more red carpets than Ryan Seacrest
Don't cross me, cause my friend, I'm no Jesus
I don't turn cheeks, I draw blood like leeches
And my friend's aim at knees, sparking heaters
Get your ass privileges with parking meters
Do I condone it or is this some kind of small talk
Course not, I'm big like horse nut
Under pressure I don't sweat like my pores shut
I'm from the tin shacks where mishaps get fixed fast
By click-clacks and big bwaps
And inside they think rap's soft
My pen sparks the benchmark I fench off tar
No sixteen, no vaccine, I'm so sick my ten bars cough
Now I'm off
