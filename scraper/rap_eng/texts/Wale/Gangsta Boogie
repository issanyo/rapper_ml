[Hook: Wale]
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
I'm not a gangsta really but all the gangstas feel me
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me

[Verse 1: Wale]
Balmain the hoody, Saint Lauren whatever
I been riding since riding the handlebars was nothing
What's a gangsta to you? Is a crew a fam?
Is a family a crew? Who is you, is a man?
I know gangstas really, coming home for 20
They just wanted history, they never hit me for money
That's gangsta to me, go hard and do it
It's two types of niggas, go yard and tomby
Blow loud and telly, all the towels are sweating
Ruvilla blue an red but, these salmon colour
Not a gangsta really, never claimed it doe
With all that money and fame, why they so gangsta for?

[Hook: Wale]
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
I'm not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me

[Verse 2: Kurupt]
You ain't no gangsta to me, the gangstas know me
You act like you knew me, I'm on the 'shaw with the fully
I'm in the Slaughter swap meet with my bitch and a bully
Off a Patron, moonwalk and some girl scout cookies
I was just a gangsta nigga with some gangsta niggas
It's too bad you just can't be a gangsta nigga
See I drive by, ride by, New Haul Drive
Then go and meet Draw by Crenshaw High
See I gangsta boogie, I gangsta boogie
I crack the bitches, they do things to me
That's the squares, just can't understand
Me, Snoop and Dazz rolling in the extra van, all alone when we

[Hook: Wale]
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
I'm not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Seen a gangsta pull out and all the gangstas boogie
Gangsta boogie, gangsta boogie
Not a gangsta fully but all the gangstas with me

[Verse 3: Daz Dillinger]
(I'm a Gangsta, Gangsta!!)
Don't you just be all about it
(I'm a Gangsta, Gangsta!!)
Knowing that the streets is ours
(I'm a Gangsta, Gangsta!!)
This is how we conquer, devour
(I'm a Gangsta, Gangsta!!)
Getting money, respect and power
(I'm a Gangsta, Gangsta!!)
I'm a gangsta first, I'm a gangsta from birth
If them gangstas make a wrong move, they ride in the hearse
You know gangstas go to jail, gangstas don't tell
Gangstas move that pack that the gangsta sell
I'm a Dogg Pound gangsta from the DPG
With Wale, Kurupt, a nigga DAC
I'm from 21st and Locus, where we gotta stay focused
Keeping it real homie, ain't nothing sugar coated
I'm a gangsta G, I rep the C
RIP, know I'm repping faithfully
I'm a gangsta by nature, gangsta by behaviour
If you loving them hoes, then the gangsta came to save ya

[Verse 4: Kurupt]
Being a gangsta is handling your business
Because I know a lot of gangstas out there
That's dead, gone, in jail and never coming back
So be smart, and keep it ghetto
