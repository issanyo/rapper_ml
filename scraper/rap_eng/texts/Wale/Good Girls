Young Boys, Wale, KB, 4-3
Timberlane, Wale probably know me from the rap
Uh Uh Ay Ay Yo Hey it's Wale I'm kind of a big deal
Rap 4-3 Hoe chill, necklace chill like children, high on Ritalin
A.D.D. my chain pay attention
Yeah, Yeah, this my year, got um all in my bars like cheers
When I'm on stage all the fly girls cheer
Flight club copped it, Chamber of Fears
Say the wrong the thang I don't hear a thang
I'm young to the saying like the tongue full of cane
Leaf on the stage, an abundance of change
Fuckin' with Wale you will never be the same let's go

(Chorus)
Let's ride and fly I can change the rest of yo' life
Take you on a natural high
Good girls never give it up on the first night
I know, I know I'm told um off of leapo
Don't blame me infinite soul
Good girls never give it up on the first night
Give it to me girl
Girl give it to me girl
(4x)
I ain't tryin' to brag but I'm bad thought they told ya
Them other niggas bad for ya ass like soda
So love it ain't nothin' but a thing
I'm pure like water, they carbonated drinks
I'm a young fly nigga, stuntin with some change
The range is KB's but I'm doin' my thang
Smooth, suave and I glide like a boxer
Floyd Mayweather I ain't never gettin' knocked out
Kinda like a brother on his last day boxed out
Boxed up, buzzed, told ya'll I'm a rockstar
I pull strings like Hendrix, a phone call getcha man hit
And Jack Slim he pimpin', he brought girls for the friendship
And catch fellas where they ended
Yes my penmanship is influential, spit that's sick that's influenza
I'm so hip-hop I can influence ya
And I'm already great motherfuck potential
Potential?, potential? shit said i'm already great motherfuck potential

(Chorus)
Let's ride and fly I can change the rest of yo' life
Take you on a natural high
Good girls never give it up on the first night
I know, I know I'm told um off of leapo
Don't blame me infinite soul
Good girls never give it up on the first night
Give it to me girl
Girl give it to me girl
(4x)
I can make a good girl bad and a bad girl worse
Keep my thing I'm cursive
Means I'm smooth when I roll
With a flow like me on top of my paper spin that ink
A fine point when I point they come near
They come close to my approach it's unfair
It's unclear exactly how I get um
It's a mix from the swag till they close to the rap
With a rap that I have for baggin' those women
Havin' those women so glad to be with us
No sag on my jeans unless those seven's
Or the double R joints those feel a little better
Ridin' in the black joint bump a little bubba
Track Tempe you know a nigga love it
I leave um real hot for real then they cop a feel
The hoes love me I'm Dr. Phil, Hey
It's Wale you probably know me from the rap
My rap fantastic a damage to tracks
I ain't not talkin' bout the flow I can clear those doubts
I'm talkin' bout your head Imma rip those out

(Chorus)
Let's ride and fly I can change the rest of yo' life
Take you on a natural high
Good girls never give it up on the first night
I know, I know I'm told um off of leapo
Don't blame me infinite soul
Good girls never give it up on the first night
Give it to me girl
Girl give it to me girl
(4x)
