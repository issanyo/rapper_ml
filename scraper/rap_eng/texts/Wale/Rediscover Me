[Intro: Wale]
Yeah
So it's like...being from Washington, D.C. and all...I ain't been noticed yet
Gridin' everyday doing all that and all that (and all that)
I'm like a treasure ain't nobody discovered yet
Please listen

[Hook: The Main Ingredient]
Rediscover me
I am ready now
Take me high on wings of love
Rediscover me
I am ready now
Take me high on wings of love
Rediscover me

[Verse 1: Wale]
Look, it's been a long time coming like multiple orgasms
Organic rap, hip-hop is back in
I'm fast with it like fast track niggas
Off that BalCo, outflow whack rap niggas
And I outclass niggas - check the truancy
So fresh fluently
Shoot the breeze up in D.C. in my cold J.B.'s - I'm doing me
When they try to do what we do they ain't cool as me - truthfully
D.C. to P.G., supplier of the freshest
Flier than all the rest of them, you niggas will respect us
A nasal-strip spitter, the game been congested
Everytime that I yell it they inhale much better
(Yeah) I'm a breathe of fresh air, nigga
Never compare to them label-made wear niggas
I don't sell crack and I don't shoot cops
I just spit from the heart: this is true hip-hop

[Hook]


[Verse 2: Wale]
(Listen) Look, now I am not the next Biggie, I'm not the next Jay
I'm not the next Nas, I am the first Wale
I'm not Kanye, I am not Lupe, though admire all rhymers, I can only do me
I'm not Cool James though the ladies love a youngin'
Stomach crunching is nothing but it's something I don't fuck with
...aww fuck it I'm stuntin' out in public
Purple Label attire while my denim's [for the public, jo?]
I got love for my brothers in the under-ground
But my sound more comparable to thunder (yes)
I admire great artist so I be in the [?] for a auto-
Graph, I am awesome
Y'all on behalf of the game my [?] gotta change cause my flow out of order
All this cordial acknowledgement by the audiences cause the flow so omnipotent

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
They say I'm not "it" cause I don't wear sweats
[?] I'm sorry I'm not the rest
I'm a premium denim getter, limited kick kicker
Spit iller than niggas who feelin' they dealin' with us
And I'm lovin' it, everybody fake - go hard but don't hardly go hard, none a bit
Let 'em wear the Coogi, my suit from the [Honduras?]
Album on the air on by the end of this summer, uhh!
They the pseudo studio gangsters created by A&Rs, my nigga I'm the ancient
Diamond of rhymin', ruby the loose leaf
Sapphire of the rap style I'm the truth, please
Fossil of hip-hop, soul spittin' gospel
Meanwhile conduct more flow than a minstrel
And that's dope - they rewind cause they love it
Unravel my rap sheets you can see the discovered

[Hook]

[Outro: Wale]
