[Verse 1: Wale]
I'm just tryna keep you flyer than you've ever been
And you the illest bitch alive, I'ma represent
And I could do without your pride, 'cause I do a lot with mine
If I'm that much on your mind you should catch a jet
Look, pardon me do, have an umâ€”never mind
Them other bums, couldn't see me with seven eyes
Forever my dress code is sovereignized
If you not an angel then tell whoever in heaven lie
Blasphemy, you the only thing running getting cash from me
And you worth spendin' money 'cause you glad for free
As she throw it back, I know you've been practicing
Ha look, double M genius
Fortified up a couple bucks worth of sneakers
Trying to find a sister like a sister of Venus
She deserves bars on feeling misdemeanor
No need to fret girl, you see that I'm the best
G.O.O.D double MG Connect
Leggings and sneakers, she say she don't need no
Heels for the evening, she turning her freak up, her freak out
Money talk shout out them up town things with that funny walk
More clown, bubble post, she forever dope
Go Harlem, it's time to start the show

[Pre-Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Oh, ah ah
I can't sweat him, he's got the best of me
I gotta get him
Oh, ah
Gotta forget him
He's got a hold on me
I gotta get him
Oh, ah ah ah

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Wale]
Tonight, I just can't deny you tonight (tonight tonight)
I can't shake the feeling inside (can't shake it)
Feel it when I look in your eyes (that I)

[Bridge: Teyana Taylor]
Gotta make that move, ay
Now baby tell me that groove
Oh no, make that move, uh
Now baby tell me that groove

[Verse 2: Teyana Taylor]
Hey, I might just let him
Take control of me
I gotta get him, oh yeah
I might just sweat him
Make a hold on me
I gotta get him, oh oh

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
Tonight, I just can't deny you tonight (tonight, tonight)
I can't shake the feeling inside (inside, inside)
Feel it when I look in your eyes (that I)

[Post-Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Wale]
Make that move, oh yeah
Baby tell me that groove, oh no
Move, ooh ooh
Boy, I'm looking at you
Tell 'em, T!

[Bridge]
Boy, I will never let you know
(Will never let you know that I can see)
The feeling that you give to me
(It makes me quiver)
Baby know you make me weak
(And I know that you just want my heart, I swear to you)
So baby won't you come with me
Boy you like just what you see
(I will never let you know that I can see)
Come on and just make your move
Baby, I would be with you
(But I think that you just want my heart, I swear to you)
(I gotta stay on the prowl)

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor & Wale]
Tonight, I just can't deny you tonight (tonight, tonight)
(Make a move, make a move)
I can't shake the feeling inside (inside, inside)
(Now or never)
Feel it when I look in your eyes (that I)

[Outro: Wale]
I need a solo
I need a solo
The beautiful Teyana Taylor, Wale, Tone-P signing off
It's been real, ladies and gentleman
Until next time, peace
