[Intro]
If I told you I wanted to talk to you
You know, you think I'm tryna holla at you
And maybe I am but
You wouldn't hear me out anyway's would you?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Rather lose love than to move on never knowing what it feel like
Short days, long nights
By the phone, no call
Need a clear mind cause I been blind, got me goin' down that road
Heart made of stone
Far away from home
Black woman you cold
Every problem that you ever had with another man I gotta face
Started off on thin ice
I'm still here but I can't skate
Slow sink, can't breathe, no remorse, don't think
Listen to your friend get another man for a minute then repeat
Queen, you deserve the title but she rejects what I give, while she nurse the wounds by them
Tried them didn't work
Got impossible standards
Nothing I'ma do is gon work
Diary of a black girl

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
Im down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out
Somehow

[Verse 2: Wale]
Raised by a momma who, who
Hates her baby father so, so
She don't have a problem with, with
Saying fuck a nigga quick, quick
I'm just tryna be the one who never run, but you run away from me
Your girlfriend's man cheat, cheat
Why not me the same thing
She can't see in me, what I see in her
This pain she inherit can't be reversed
I can't even stay living in the shade of all the motherfuckers that played ya
The irony in that is that I ain't even that, but you put it those pages
Wife, you deserve the label but, but you been hurt before so you sore and don't feel your able
Tried them didn't work, got impossible standards, nothing I ever do works
Diary of a black girl

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
Im down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out
Somehow

[Verse 3: Wale]
See all I ever wanna do is be relevant
Just tell me that I ever meant anything
Or that you could ever see me and you in another light
But it's like the dark women endures the darkest nights by the wrong man
And see mostly all of them have made you somewhat incapable of a first impression
What I do is I channel my aggression with no cable or antenna
Just intentions to impress you, if capable
Hoping that the material possessions can materialize to a better you
Cars, nothing I drive can drive you out of this frame of mind
With such an ugly picture in it and
Money, nothing I buy can buy me more time for your ears to tell your heart to listen to it
Diamonds, a girl's best friend is what they say, but believe me with the right allegiance shorty you gon shine anyways
And every day that goes by is a couple more lines in her diary
The day before is better than the present
So anyone presented in her presence endures these life sentences
No key for release
No reason to be around
Her minds in the clouds
She writes it all down
In her diary

[Chorus: Marsha Ambrosius]
I wonder why, I sit and cry
Wish I could shed all these tears
Im down and out
I'll keep on moving and tryna get out
I don't know how to move on
Where I went wrong
I wish I could live with no fear
So down and out
I'll keep it moving and tryna get out
Somehow
