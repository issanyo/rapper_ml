[Intro]
Don’t go over there, shit, I be skating too
So don’t go over there
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, (over there)
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap, (over there)
We from over there
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap
Clap, clap, clap, clap, clap (over there), hah

[Hook: French Montana]
Heard they shooting niggas, don’t go over there, hah
Stabbing, killing niggas, don’t go over there, hah
Thirty other niggas, don’t go over there, hah
South side, we from over there, hah
Heard they killing niggas, don’t go over there, hah
Stabbing, killing niggas, don’t go over there, hah
Thirty other niggas, don’t go over there, hah
East side, we from over there
Don’t go over there, don’t go over there
Don’t go over there, don’t go over there

[Verse 1: French Montana]
South side, they call that, they shoot guns, they snort that
They rob chains, they carjack, got a payback for all that
Don’t, don’t go over there, nigga, if you ain't from over there
Run upon you with that nina, cash out right over there
Ain’t nothing changed, still fucking niggas over there
Catch them niggas slipping, then we leave them niggas over there
Your main bitch be blowing there, don’t get touring over there
Coke boys had snow in there, like Boston George that blow in there
Drop top off now my coupe looking brainless
I be twisted off a blue dot while my niggas twisting fingers
And it led them niggas famous, gave you couple pages on the front news nigga
Don’t make one move, montana

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Cracks on the block, niggas call that lipo'
Hustlers on the corners doing pull ups on the light pole
Shawty got hit, ain’t even party yet
Been about a week the family ain’t get the body yet
Police don’t come over here, please don’t come over here
You on your own if you getting caught over here
She bust that pussy open, she’s a ho there
That new apartment that you got her, we was over there
The stash that you left, it ain’t over there
Fucked her 4 times and never went back over there
You know I don’t care, never gave a fuck
Like a church full of nuns, ain’t no saving us

[Hook:]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Nigga I’m from over there
Where bitches got them fake lips, fake ass and that bogus hair
Ha, load is here, better know my soldiers here
Mix it up a lil more in here, thank god got my chauffeur here
Everytime my show is here, and I know them hoes in here
And my flow that Sistine Chapel, gotta know my show is rare
My flow is rare, and I keep my toes in Airs
And I keep my hoes in check, and I keep my foes in fear
Don’t go over there, nah, not there or there, or there or there
Nigga stay right there

[Hook:]
