[Chorus: Wale]
I got my family and I got my squad
And as long as they got me, then I'll be just fine
So I give God the glory 'cause I have my child
And America don't want me, that's when I realized
That we all need, yeah, a reason to smile
I said we all need, yeah, a reason to smile
Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah but we gon' survive
That's why we all need, yeah, a reason to smile

[Verse 1: Wale]
And a possible bigot slash misogynist
Is 'bout to run the whole damn thing
('Bout to run the whole damn thing)
And the ballot my sister filled in
In another city didn't do a goddamn thing

[Bridge: Wale]
Shit I'ma go crazy, yeah
I'ma go crazy, yeah
I'ma go crazy, yeah
But I gotta do my goddamn thing

[Verse 2: Wale]
The Alt Rights hate us
Some black baby mommas hate us
We only learn half of the drama, other side crazy
On behalf of Charlamagne, I'm sure he ain't tradin' sides
Maybe I should meet Tomi Lahren, I'll Lauryn Hill her
Train her; she miseducated anyway, yeah
Prolly hate the color of my face
I'm just a young black rappin' ass African
Ain't never wanted to have it and now he has it his own way
I'm smokin' purple, the law enforcement be murkin' brothers
The moon lit and I'm Cottonmouth like Mahershala
It's like you got a curse if your currency low
The world is a dirty fuckin' experiment
They don't care if its hurtin' us
Black lives matter, 'cause black lives target practice
Can't even imagine what would happen with no phone cameras
Black lives matter, black love the dopest ever
Just wanna remind you, I think it's time that we show it better forever

[Chorus: Wale]
I got my family and I got my squad
And as long as they got me, then I'll be just fine
So I give God the glory 'cause I have my child
And America don't want me, that's when I realized
That we all need, yeah, a reason to smile
I said we all need, yeah, a reason to smile
Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah but we gon' survive
That's why we all need, yeah, a reason to smile

[Verse 3: Wale]
Giving knowledge and uplifting our brothers and daughters
Is how this whole thing change, yeah
(Is how this whole thing change)
But the power that's in the pussy or the dollar
Is enough to make us all insane

[Bridge: Wale]
Shit I'ma go crazy, yeah
I'ma go crazy, yeah
I'ma go crazy, yeah
But I gotta do my goddamn thing

[Verse 3: Phil Ade]
And I've been livin' like I got one
A couple hundred on me, still in the gold shotgun
You do the most, stop son, our people not exempt
They in the land of the free, you in the land of free to an extent
Fuck that, I'ma ruffle some feathers, mess with the temperature
Shuffle the weather, fuck who do ever, Keisha or Heather
Beef, itâ€™s whatever, kill me, you die and I live forever
When you live without fear, it don't get much better
Naw, hmm, look at how far that we've come
Look at the world we inspired and look at the stars that we brung
They think that when that literal big wig starts that we done
They think because Hillary lost that the cards will be Trumped
You out you mind, nigga

[Chorus: Wale]
I got my family and I got my squad
And as long as they got me, then I'll be just fine
So I give God the glory 'cause I have my child
And America don't want me, that's when I realized
That we all need, yeah, a reason to smile
I said we all need, yeah, a reason to smile
Said about to be O.D.'d, yeah but we gon' survive
That's why we all need, yeah, a reason to smile
