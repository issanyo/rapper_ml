[Verse 1]
Yea, I been humble too long
Grew up in the jungle where it's killers at war
Gorillas at the door fiends sleeping on the floor
And this is DC where the rich see the poor
Cause they right down the street
My chances were shallow somehow I'm so deep
My ex bitch bitter now cause everything sweet
Take Cee around town as if everything cheap
Shawty put it on me
Yea, smoking loud enjoying my youth
Take you out kentland and show you a zoo
I don't need a bunch of jewels to show you I'm cool
Pathological liars even know I'm the truth
Ridin' through my city car black can't see out
If I get stopped, have a bitch throw the weed out
God know me and God love me so fuck y'all
Love bitches that love reading and love malls
Love reefer and love sneaker above those
She keep her eyes open and her fucking mouth closed
Yea, underrated like a muthafucka
Lightning, Raiden on this muthafucka
Writing, amazing with this muthafucka
Lay a 16, they go crazy in this muthafucka
Okay, fucking with me nigga no way
No days off and that's even on a snow day
Closed case I'm a muthafuckin g
Been stunting since teen wearing something obscene Joe
Come see real niggas on my team
Though I know a couple niggas tryna hem my long jeans Joe
And that's Jay line I had to quote that
And I'm a black star that's word to Mos Def
Hate a lot of y'all don't gotta go in depth
Smoking on that loud kinda feel like I'm going deaf
I got rhymes for days nigga I'm cold
Y'all niggas can leave if my niggas a go
Y'all won't even breath if I tell them to go
My goal is going gold with out selling my soul
Why probe our ass
Why a black nigga take ass over class
Can't win with a passive attack
I ain't sold too many records cause the math was inaccurate
Bad bitches have us, bag full of magnums
Y'all won't, but you know I'm gonna like Accra
That's the capital of Ghana for you idiots
Me and my affiliates the hottest in the city bitch
