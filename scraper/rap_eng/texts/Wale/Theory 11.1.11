[Intro: 2Pac]
When I was young I read a lot, I wrote poetry..
I would have been a totally different person
Had I not been exposed to these things
I'm not saying I'm going to change the world
But I guarantee I will spark the brain that will change the world...

[Verse 1: Wale]
Sometimes a simple cadence can get in the way of greatness of a nigga statements
I feel I know a little bit of everything but Ive grown unfamiliar with limitations
See Im just a narrator thats see the world as a nigga who never made it
I forever debate a nigga who stand in the way of my standing ovation
Nigga I'd be lying to tell you my mind isn't exhausted
But to recline is to say God's blessing isn't as awesome as I flaunted
See I got more haters and nay sayers than eight Lakers in Boston
So I happen to Phil Jacksons along the way with this talking
See I give my heart to an unforgiven genre where passion is frowned upon
With a muzzle around em all a league full of dry rhymers I proceed to .. cannonball
Loose cannon starts us off and crucified for the passionate ways ..
Im only but a man but man enough to challenge all
And I love you all
And I pray you just don't think I'm smart and see my vision and know my heart
This is 11.1.11 .. 11.1.11 ..
11.1.11 is when it all makes sense
When my critics break down and make amends with my supporters
Who been supporting me since day one can tell you niggas who fronted
Wale polish and guess what Wale got it..
I am just an artist
I am just a man
May not change the world
But let me inspire someone who can
Who can(4x)
