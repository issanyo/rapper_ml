[Intro: Wale]
Don't... Don't...
Don't say shit
Don't say shit
I told a nigga don't say shit if you can't make a lame bitch famous in your day shift
I promise I'll pilot you baby
Young legend, new legend, [?] what up?

[Verse 1: Wale]
Aww, hold up
Did her right up in lonely
She sending me nude pics
I send her flight confirmation in emoji's (bloop)
Hustle back, but it ain't me
Sitting back with a back with Maybach seats
Nike OG's, a little Givenchy
But a nigga only (skrr!) when I see police
Follow me, it's nine-something
Okay, we sky dwelling
I ship it off to fix it, lord knows that my time coming
Lord knows my time coming
Lord knows my time coming
Lord knows I land in [?] straight with my Goyard luggage
But on the other surface
Keep your people quiet
No, I don't know Captain Planet, but one (RRRING!) will bring that fire
(RAH RAH RAH RAH)
Me no lying
Just Pinot, and we no whining
Just so you know
Rollie go for 24, cause eventual
Tick, tock, not at all, call it kemosabe

[Hook: Wale]
Tick, tock, tick, tock
Nigga money is time
And I ain't got enough to waste until my niggas in line
Tick, tock, tick, tock
Nigga money is time
And time is money, acting funny cause I can't give you mine
Oh yeah
Know that money is time
And time is money, acting funny cause I can't give you mine
Tick, tock, tick, tock
Nigga money is time
And time is money, acting funny cause I can't give you mine

[Verse 2: Jazz Lazer]
Aww, yeah
Black rosé
Teared away arena heights, that's a cold play
White mosé
Woulda thought a nigga came from the dope game
Nope, I was too busy spitting that propane
Fucking on your main
Eastside LV where I remain
J-A-Z man
You wouldn't get the picture if a drew it
You wouldn't catch my drift if I threw it
Bad bitches only wanna ride with a nigga in a new whip
Tricking on her heart, I can't do it
(Nah I can't do it. I don't know why, I just can't do that shit
When you gon' get me some shoes...
I'm like, bitch, when you gon' get ME some shoes?
Shout out Wale doe)

[Hook]
