[Intro]
First and foremost, I'd like to thank everyone from Maryland, DC, and Virginia
I'd like to thank the haters, I'd like to thank the lovers
? to me on 43
We love you all
Sneakerman, what up
Promo, what up
OD, what up

[Verse 1]
I keep my brim low
My eyes even lower
Nigga I'm not high, but it's hard for me to focus cause
My chain, hot dang, it be glowin'
Brighter than hazard lights, so I'm likely on the shoulder
My, kicks clean, yeah I can chauffeur
Sure I am focused, check the way my toes purr
I'm el gato, they hot and I got those
You ain't got cheese like taco, they nachos
To Bosco, I don't play I'm Jake Voscal
Niggas make cake like Harpo
Y'all soft, when you talk, I hear the harps pull
She like me cause my whip, that's what I call a carpool
They carpool Wale
The seats cheescake but the car sorbet
A sure bet
Yeah I'm the flyest of the lyricists
Even on an off day, my fit appraised for a grip
Northface don, mine but a ?
While y'all niggas stay involved with that lover on the phone

[Hook]
Pimp hard
Oh lord, there he go again
Any disbelievers, is believing we be showin' them
Oh nah, so far he be doin' it
I can give it to you niggas, what you gonna do with it

[Verse 2]
See I
Get dough, my clothes more superior
Seriously err'body askin' where I get 'em from
I be in my double R jeans and
I don't skateboard, but a brother SB'n
I'm on that fly shit
That you ain't got shit
That if you copped, wouldn't know how to rock, shit
They wearin' Vans shit
I underhandedly slammed them
With that fire sittin' on this man's foot
Got my dunks on, but they look like sneakers
Look at me people my shoe games' ether
Pledge my allegiance to swoosh, fuck beastin'
Sneakers that look like slippers and cheap jumps
Sneaker man and ducky, they gon' hold me down
We doin' major in 06
Ask around
I'm what they hopin' 'bout
I'm what they boast for
I'm who they raisin' they glass and have a toast for
Put your cups up like implant
For the rap Rembrandt
Creatine dough
My wallet is a gym rat
Sets and reps until my account swoll up
Miguel Tejada, getting my O's up
