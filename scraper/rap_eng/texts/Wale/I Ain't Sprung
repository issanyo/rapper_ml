[Intro]
Nah I ain't sprung or nothing
But I like you like..like a lil bit
Like just a lil tiny bit..like a lil tiny bit

[Verse 1: Wale]
Name Wale probably know me from the you know
Game proactive, try and play it safe
I don't do dishes but I throw away your plates
And I don't cook much but I'm tough with that phone book
Call Levi's we can see about the home cook
Colder than the cold, I'm sneezing achoo
I don't kiss and tell, that's so middle school
I'm past that, I'm working on my master
I can pass cash way faster than FAFSA
I'll be your work study, Just work for me
I'll be your student loan girl you ain't heard nothing
And I ain't tryna spit, but got dollars here
You tryna learn love, then here's a scholarship
I got a lot of kicks gotta stay fresh
Y'all test like professors, you can get ahead
And nine out of ten broads call a nigga arrogant
Five out of nine broads all get curious
Four out of five try to fake and get serious
But all ten of them gonna call a nigga period
Call a nigga period, call a nigga period
Just a little sprung but don't call me on your period
