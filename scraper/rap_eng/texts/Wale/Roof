[Hook: Unknown]
This is how we run it down the line
You rock your way and I rock mine
You got eight balls and I got nine
If you okay, well then I'm fine
This is how we run it down the line
You rock your way and I rock mine
You got eight balls and I got nine
If you okay, well then I'm fine

[Verse 1: Wale]
As the image of 'Pac still reigns in the face of the culture
The game change quick like it's modeling and couture
Although pure, I'm tainted with the image
My presence official; Mama knew that I'd be gifted
Now, unwrapped to run rap, the untapped
Market, this is Brita come and get your glass
I'm kicking raps; I'm taking names
I make currency out of worrying, for surely I can make it rain
I'm simply saying that I can't care less
Their aim's so plain to a lyrical air-jet
Delirious, they are, having a world with words
Their disturbing the church, the great god of the metaphor
The hallelujah, the righter of the writer movement
Disciple students, I provide the tutoring
You can't f with it, you're knew to this
No, you can't f with it like a neutered pet

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wale]
Truthfully, I don't care what they think of me
Them dudes straight cookies, lingering in lingerie
Mama told me there'd be days like this
But I ain't never ever think there'd be a day like this. No
Police watch like jewelers;
They stay on us tight like their wallets on, wallets on frugal
You ain't close; I'm a new bold, too tall
You ain't nothing but a cool coach, Luke Longly
My arm reach well exceeds y'all
The birds love it and the GAP girls fiend for it
Police warrant says, "Need to know more, jo"
As long as you flash dreads and cornrows
The strong arm of the forces have forced me
Off balance like a formation offset
Line. I tend to audible the mind
You fell in love with a trifle in design
Uh. Wale

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wale]
Wa-le
The lies, they conspire
Do it the whole time
Although they seldom try
They'll never be defined like
Street slang. One time for the peace, man
If you ain't heard, brothers crooked in PG, man
If that ain't bad enough, these kids busting over dumb beef
You'd think they had enough
No. More beef, more bitches, more bodies
Everybody nay-saying like hip-hop defined us
If that's normal, I'm a hip-hop defiant
Fire in the eye, cyclops desire
I write the rhyme, get my block inspired
My block, then your block, until I retire
And I will not slide, no. I'm born for the Metro
Embody every block. I'mma walk it, leggo
Run until my leg go. Pedal 'til my metal fall off
When I talk, brothers follow my echo
