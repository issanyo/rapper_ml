[Intro]
May the optimism of tomorrow be your foundation for today

[Chorus]
The spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can’t tell a lie
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now

[Interlude]
I can't lie I feel quite phenomenal today baby
That new black soul

[Verse 1]
I was in the business when you was chasin' the bitches
Now I got the dollars, I'm tryin' get my position
Couple bad decisions I got some character issues
Although I'm never slippin' like student parent permission
Yes, I am aware that America tryna get me
So I let my friends carry paraphernalia
Before I love a industry girl, I'll marry civilian
Picture a young, rich woman taking me serious
Although I hit my stride, ain't even in prime (nah)
Singles in the chart make a broad lose top these days
You ain't gotta do nothin to pop these days
Instagram is runnin' they thoughts these days
62 joint, got me Doug-in on em
Humbled, got my ass dropped now I'm stuntin' on 'em
You better know that you overdo for some better endings
That's who whoever develop second-guessing they blessing
Ralph...

[Chorus]
The spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can’t tell a lie
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now

[Interlude]
I just need you to vibe with me real quick
We came from nothin'

[Verse 2]
I don't like to boast but they ain't touchin' the flow (nope)
Fuck a therapist, I put everything in this cone
My only fear is marriage she scared of bein' alone
She settle for this bread so therein should be a trophy
I'ma prolly marry somebody already familiar
VH1 10 and I'm not thinkin' about these bitches
Can do without opinions
Another brother caught up in the business
Had that lock since I lost my scholarship
I been gettin' it to my old coach and ballin'
Rose gold was forty, dopest nigga recordin'
Make hoes sprint the 40
See me I thought money would change it, it got worse
But it's a lot better than screamin' "who got work?" (who got work?)
From opening up for Back to packing out 9:30
I never sold crack when crack rappin' was workin'
With that fact its back packin' and murkin'
Gettin' that Bobby Heenan while you Mr. Perfect

[Chorus]
The spotlight on my fans
Sunshine, I can’t tell a lie
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now
Want me to say what they just wanna hear now

[Outro]
Folarin the Genius
I told you this that new black soul
We ain't posed to never ha-
We ain't posed to never have
