Yeah, Folarin
Wizzy got a dope pair
See my money gon stack
Pidgin am in next year
Pito like it’s first class
Let me meet your girl jor
Mtcheww, take your girl back
Didn’t even know she ain’t smoke

On my way to Ondo state am motivating all the n!ggas that not had much
Hands hands hands up

Bands bands bands up
Bands bands bands up
Hold up, spread something girl girl
Do your dance up
