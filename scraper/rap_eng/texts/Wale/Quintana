[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope

[Verse 1: Travi$ Scott]
Praise to the pope
Bless you with this dope
Step into my world where we get ghost
Cause in my mind we float
Every time we step into 1Oak
They tweaking off the coke
Fuck I'm out my mind, I'm burning bread
So much let's have a toast
Cause my niggas and momma know
If I wasn't here, nigga I'd be dead
Now I'm in the building thinking billions
Counting millions, what a feeling
Remember when I never ever made shit?
Now me and my niggas rocking chains
And whipping slave ships
Now who the slave bitch?

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope

[Verse 2: Travi$ Scott]
Straight from the lair or Himalayas
I got more keys than the mayor, let's have a prayer
Kelly Divine off in my pager, I'll hit her later
Dawn to dusk I'm tryna get made, I been up for days
Damn I'll never pop another pill, man that shit is real
Girl, you know you fucking with La Flame
You know you know the drill
I reach to the heavens, Lord forgive me, I sin
May La Flame live forever, and always bring 'em in

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope

[Verse 3: Wale & Travis Scott]
Look, y'all niggas can't fuck with me
I've got a bunch of bitches tryna fuck with me
I'm unsociable with like most of them
Cause I don't socialize with them suckers, see?
Lyrically I will demolish
This is the nail in the coffin, niggas is soft
Niggas remind me of nails at a spa
So under-polished, novices
They barkin' up the wrong tree (double M)
Trust me if you with me then you goin' eat
I got them sweatin' like these bitches herein all day
And I'm off Atlantic, 2-1 rob 'em, bumbaclot, nigga
Not a P-O-K, I'm out for the VS
Get lifted, few zips like a Steep Tech
Use piff, short words for the loose girls
All mine's re-up, y'all regret
Don't worry 'bout my team, my team is set
Don't worry 'bout T, it's in-depth
When it comes to the mothafuckin' c-notes
Weâ€™ll start us a mothafuckin' glee club
God damn...

[Bridge: A$AP Bari & Travis Scott]
La Flame, don't play no games
These niggas is lames
These niggas ain't lords, we the new lords
Lord, self-sacrifice
Mercy me, oh, mercy me
Mercy me, oh, mercy me
Mercy me, oh, mercy me
Mercy me, oh, mercy me
Mercy me

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope
Straight from Mexico, call her Quintana
Damn she smoke my dope
Swear to God we go Rambo
If you disrespect the dope
