[Intro: Colin Kaepernick]
"I mean, people are dying in vain because this country isn't holding up their end of the bargain, as far as, you know, giving freedom and justice and liberty to everybody. It's something that's not happening
And I've seen videos, I've seen certain circumstances where men and women who have been in the military have come back and been treated unjustly by the country they fought for, and have been murdered by the country they fought for - on our land."

[Chorus]
Hold Up!
Run that track, run that back
Soldier with militant raps on deck
Whole 'nother level, white boy tryna kill me
Whole lotta melanin, black don't crack
And I'm in my bag, am I bad?
I'm unapologetic, be forever pro-black
No Nazi gonna stop this bag
Infrared beam on confederate flag

[Verse]
I ain't with the rhetoric the president be on
Forever with my niggas in the level that we on
Count 'em on your fingers
Tryna put on for the city
Put a bullet in a nigga, call me nigga and he wrong
Look, you a coward nigga, eat a dick
Shoutout 'Lik, rocking EAT and shit
MMG this is the DMV
Free Trell, Flock, y the rest
Khaled, nigga, We The Best
Call Goodell, we need to speak and shit
Rap a piece about that CTE
And give Kaepernick a new team to check
Right now 'cause
Shit gettinâ€™ deep for us right now
They killin' our seeds boy right now
So we gon take a knee 'fore he pipe down
Chuck D., Chuck D. we gone fight power
Chuck a deuce if he choose and he not down
I just had a baby girl and I'm so proud
And she so, so smart and she's so brown
I'ma hold mine down, what are you about?
West side, I'ma ride, doing suicides
West side, I'ma ride, playing old 'Pac
A sports top, I hope it's seven on the tre watch
I'ma sit court side, with a broad with a clique like Fort Knox
With a broad with the shits cause she roll too
And she hate fake hoes with the bantu knots
Uhm stop, Black is never going out of style
Look at Melo, Sniper and Lebron
And then LaMelo, then they get to Zion
I ain't even lyin', not a people person but I do be havin' colored people pride
What you need, some visine to see the vibe, nigga?
Me and my people need to rise up and see that our people be the prime
'Less you well endowed or you being white
Your a bi demon green or white, wallet open bitch I see it twice

[Chorus]
Run that back, run that back
Soldier with militant raps on deck
Whole 'nother level, white boy tryna kill me
Whole lotta melanin, black don't crack
And I'm in my bag,  am I bad?
I'm unapologetic, be forever pro-black
No Nazi gonna stop my bag
Spray a whole magazine on a red MAGA hat like.... (raaar, raaar)
