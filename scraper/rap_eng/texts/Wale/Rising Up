[Intro: Questlove & Chrisette Michele]
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing
The same song all day long
So I told her
I got something you've been waiting for [x2]

[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Yesterday I saw a B-girl crying
I walked up and asked what's wrong
She told me that the radio's been playing
The same song all day long

[Post-Hook: Black Thought]
(So get your glass, lift it up in the toast position
We getting paper like John Travolta get it
Cause we focused wit' it, we supposed to get it
You know me and my whole squad, we so committed
We not the kids cooling out on the sofa with it
We about to dominate the globe like Oprah did it
We getting paper like John Travolta, nigga)

[Verse 1: Black Thought]
Well I'm a downtown shooter who that?
The crown ruler is back
He kind of grew into the shape of a mack
Look how I do it, yo I'm taking you back
This how you rise down to the foundation
How sacred is that?
I'm from the number one place on the map
The generational gap with yet another sensational track
And we don't stress for nothing I just press the button
It's as simple as just making it hap'
To all the frauds stop faking, relax
And to the broads if you caking
Then clap then shake it without breaking your back
I know the world been waiting for that
You been aching for that cause
What they playing on the station is whack
And I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque my squad, so fresh
You know it's Black Thought
And your boy the bro ?uest, but

[Verse 2: Wale]
Hip-Hop ain't dead cause the pulse is in us
I got the Everclear flow, they mimosa with it
We are the hope of the culture, they supposed to listen
And I'm supposed to pivot like I'm a forward in the league
I'm Oden with it
Yet don't owe them niggas nothing but potent lyrics
But if you ain't got the dance they revoke your spinning
So good rappers ain't eating, they Olsen twining
But I'm so committed, they have grown familiar
With the counterfeit hitters they so-so with it
But they are Sosa with it
They Mark McGwire with the written, I'm Rodriguez
On the road to riches this is the fork I'm hitting
This is the trial-and-error era, no co-defendant
I push The Seed every time like I'm Cody with it
I said the one-hit wonders pneumonia to us
I don't know you niggas
Hit the road, my nigga

[Verse 3: Black Thought]
Where my grimy figures at?
Look lively addressing the captain
Show me where your first impression is at
And where your dedication to the true profession is at
How you laugh, answer me
"What kind of question is that?"
I'll show you where my rare essence is at, the adolescence of rap
The real muscle in the message of that
My name trouble I'm a blessing to rap
And you can check my stats cuz worldwide they attesting to that
So nigga listen you can probably learn a lesson perhaps
How I'm like Bobby DeNiro, Joe Pesc and them cats
Am I the unsung hero? Oh, yes
If you asking anybody that's aware of the classics
They'll tell you I'm a legend in the flesh that dress to impress
The best is that which I accept and nothing less
My stacks is grotesque
My squad, so fresh
You know its Black Thought
And your boy the bro Quest, but
