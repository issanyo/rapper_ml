[Intro]
My nigga Glizzy, I told Glizzy I got 'em
I believe that it's his time

[Chorus: Wale]
37 niggas all of em official riding through the city, trying get my dollars bigger
If nobody get us
Trying body nigga
Just tell somebody, tell somebody that I came in with that
Southside, southside, south
Southside, southside, south
37 wassup
Southside, southside, south
Southside, southside, south
37 wassup

[Verse 1: Shy Glizzy]
Okay, I'm number 37, call me Gizzy Strasburg
That's all the way to heaven nigga fuck, what y'all heard?
I took a knife to the gut, y'all ain't felt that pain
Tell theme niggas we up ain't nothing else to explain
I'm the flyest youngin out
Fuck what you talking bout
Rob a nigga for his chain to match the gold in my mouth
(Give that shit up)
Damn, I still can't believe I rap
Man, I still got the keys to the trap
Wale made it out the city
He showed me this can happen
They don't understand I come from where shit like this don't happen
37th born
37th raised
I'm with 37 G's
And we got 37 K's

[Chorus: Wale]
37 niggas all of em official riding through the city, trying get my dollars bigger
If nobody get us
Trying body nigga
Just tell somebody, tell somebody that I came in with that
Southside, southside, south

Southside, southside, south

All my music state facts

Bloods out Virginia
