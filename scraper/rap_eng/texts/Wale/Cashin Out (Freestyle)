[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
Cool
36 Os so riding round with that nina
Riding with a ho named Keisha, smoking on Keisha
My diamonds talk for me, they say, "Hi, can I meet you?"
G5, how high in the sky, ho I can't see you
Got a condo on my wrist, girl, I'm cashing out
Got a condo around my neck, girl, I'm cashing out
36 Os so I'm riding round with that nina
My diamonds talk for me, they say "Hi, can I meet you?"

[Verse: Wale]
I got these tats all on my arms
Smoke one stack straight to my dome
Pay my haters not too much mind
You pay your favorite stripper car note
Yeah I'm cashing out, I'm all Madden dog
I'm understanding that bull like a matador
Top 10 in my category
Bought a brand new car for my after party
These shows be packing tight
Couple grand when I rock the night
Got a chauffeur, bumping Coke Boyz
These hoes ain't acting right
Camera to the road trying to mack to a shone
Woodstock though, couple bands on the floor
Got ten on the floor, stop playing with flow
High as D'Angelo notes in a Ghost
Nigga met her at Vanquish
But she say she from Bankhead
Where the thing is amazing
So ain't no way you gon' wait for relations
Got it matching though
Put the bottles up, put the glasses out
Red bottoms y'all and the ass is out
She a honest girl so I'mma slam her out
Outstanding clout, what up Greg Street
More money that mean less sleep
It's all good, finna dog that
Be a wack cat be my pet peeve
Ass shots in her Seven Jeans
Five shots she ready to leave
Fendi daughter my PRP, but nigga Fendi brought me your NC
Fayetteville I'm out Raleigh too
She gonna dance when that Molly through
My liver's cold, I got the frigid flow
So before I go, you should harvest food
And them niggas ain't fly, where the fuck your purple label at
And when the club close down bet you don't know where your lady at
Why you saving that, with her misbehaving ass
Don't pay for that, double-MG nigga brag about
Just like that... Wale

[Chorus: Ca$h Out]
