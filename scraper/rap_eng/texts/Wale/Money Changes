[Verse 1: Wale]
Don't do it for money, see that come and it go
Get you a couple of cars, bitches love you for those
Get some diamonds you can't afford, rhyming is not important
Attire gotta be that fire, you tryna become a baller I know
Money comes, money stays, money goes
Seen a bump in my sale cuz of Forbes
Like oh, let 'em know that's how niggas go from that ballin' to 30 for 30 broke
And I used to hear the stories of glory of servin' coke
But I was more concerned with the corners and cover four
Politics give me stress, I got enough on my soul
Cause they don't tell me to pray, but they preying on me to vote

[Hook: Chrisette Michele]
Love stays, money goes, love a nigga rich
Love games, funny hoes, on a nigga dick
Let me love you though, I ain't like these chicks
Lovin' you for your dough, money go quick
Love stays, money goes, love a nigga rich
Love games, funny hoes, on a nigga dick
Let me love you though, I ain't like these chicks
Lovin' you for your dough, money goes quick

[Verse 2: Wale]
Clap clap, as the room praise
I go unfazed, these rappers lack taste
A bunch of real slaves, and fake chains
Turnin' my old hoes, into new flames
So where is mother nature, tryna kill my complainin'
Cuz these strippers give me shade unless it's finna rain
Ok dap dap, she doesn't see a star
White women gawking asking what that Rolly cost
Yeah I know your motives, you'll never know my heart
I know enough to know that jewelry got me more regard
I had that frozen watch, and I was better fly
Had she seen me roadside she'd prolly drive by

[Hook]

[Bridge: Chrisette Michele]
Wale, will you marry me
Not for your pedestal, but for your pedigree
I'll buy my own diamond things
We'll just get custom tattoos instead of wedding rings
I'm not like these hoes and I know your heart's been broken
This could be your chosen, my heart I'm exposin'

[Hook]
