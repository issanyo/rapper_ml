[Verse 1]
Revolution might be televised
But make sure if they do see
Them people see my good side
Black nigga with intellect
6th grade I was Special Ed
10th grade, eyes red as shit
Lookin' like a nigga just left Japan
Well goddamn, now I be the man
And every bitch kickin it with me goin Mia Hamm
Every visit to Neimans, I swear don't even see a tag
When you're reachin' your dreams
You got reason to brag
Ambition over everything
And I never plan on settling
And my wish is to have everything
And my only fear's a wedding ring
Hopin' that my niggas see
Hopin' that these bitches saw it
Hopin' when this bread get here
I got the same addiction for it
Niggas think I'm slippin, niggas is lunchin'
Either dumb or smokin' dippers or something

[Chorus]
No days off, no days off
Heard they coming for a nigga
Bitch, I'm Ray Charles
No days off
Takin' breaks will leave you broken
And we can't fall
No days off, no days off
Heard they coming for a nigga
Bitch, I'm Ray Charles
No days off
Takin' breaks will leave you broken
And we can't fall

[Verse 2]
I used to sleep hungry in a bed next to roaches
Now I wake up, play a beat and burn a couple roaches
Permanently focused, learning while I'm going
And the word most important
Don't regurgitate my sperm
Let me work that, know I'm nasty
But I'm actually quite respectful
But you call a bitch a bitch
And real bitches don't respect you
And that's fucked up
But I guess that shit's just tough love
Around my way, I'm cut throat
And what I done just ain't enough
Fly shit ain't not thang to us
20 somethin', no baby ma
Ma want me to go find a wife
I'm like sorry ma, this not the time
Can't decide, take em out
G'd up, shake it down
Weed up, better make a sound
Greened up, I'm like De La Salle
Higher than high school
Mariah tunes and five flutes
Or 5'2" hoopers in light shoes
Never liked school
Reckless when I move
Where I from, it get cold
Niggas die over shoes
Niggas shoot over bitches
Bitches get niggas set up
Stuck up, beat up, and wet up
That's why I never met em
That's why forever I love seldom and trust never
And fuck whoever don't put one hundred percent in
Nigga

[Chorus]
No days off, no days off
Heard they coming for a nigga
Bitch, I'm Ray Charles
No days off
Takin' breaks will leave you broken
And we can't fall
No days off, no days off
Heard they coming for a nigga
Bitch, I'm Ray Charles
No days off
Takin' breaks will leave you broken
And we can't fall
