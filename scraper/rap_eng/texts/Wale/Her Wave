Don't give my love away
Don't give my love away
Cause I know you got that wave
Everybody ride
I trendsetter that, yeah she it
Been doing it for years
Let me take you out
This gear all the bitches like
Right right, right right

[Verse]
This ain't 'bout no feelings, girl
This ain't 'bout no feelings
Let me get you off the floor
I ain't got no ceilings
I don't really know you really
But your IG 250
How cool is you? Bravo
That's sarcasm and that's my bag
And if you not with it, gotta roll
I'm too lit for ya
Cross my heart and 4 limbs on that
Think about it, don't talk about it
Social awkward, I'm an introvert
I make it nasty, I make it nasty
I make you cum so much it make you mad
I'm talkin' uh uh, get it back to back
Ski-daddle, I'm like a straight up savage
That face, body and mind, yeah
How many compliments you need today?
I won't play ya and I keep it wet
Tell your team it's a rain delay, yeah
Under legs, you got an arm on her
Now she tryna escape, yeah
I'm a little excited
But you not tryna go, don't be tryna stay
Still cool with the young, round the way
Still blow tree, but the G round the way
'Til P told me she don't really like the beat
Said RIP, then I found a way
Knock ya head, knock ya head, EBM
Winter cold with it but I'm Easter fresh
The realest nigga screaming DMV for life
My niggas in Dior, you niggas in DMs

[Hook]
Don't give my love away
Don't give my love away
Cause I know you got that wave
Everybody ride
I trendsetter that, and she it
Been doing it for years
Let me take you out
This gear all the bitches like
Right right, right right
