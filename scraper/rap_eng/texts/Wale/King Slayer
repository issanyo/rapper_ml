[Verse 1]
Got my back to the wall, this isn't rap, this is war
Took a sabbatical, I'll battle anybody who want it
These are my king knack for words, as a actual sword
I could decapitate a rapper, if he be lackin' he gone
Know that my faction too strong, know that my passion that throne
Know that my team is afloat, no matter what raft that we on
What did you think? Homie I'm never gon' sink, I'll be forever a G
Comin' at me? Haters capiche, I'll throw you a piece like [?] on the beat
The homie a beast, you know where I be so who want it with me?
Lil homie a beast, with double M G, my young'ns is deep
And every full moon, that's fact I'm on
I'm tellin' whoever is messin' with me, could bring you that Khaleesi heat
Burn up, like I'm tryna fill the urn up
And I'm tryna be the best so see my speech as massacre
Word up, better back up or I'll pack out that black car service
Get you back up when I'm back up and I plan on murkin'
Your ass is curtains

[Verse 2]
Fakin' on us and we gon' ride out
I ain't fakin' dawg and you can find out
Chest pokin' up but what your mind 'bout?
Bet when it be on, they gon' hide out
Seein' haters tryna bring me down, no
King slayer knock you out your crown, know
Loyalty and honor what the crew bout
You thinkin' too hard, what is you 'bout?
Family over monetary any day
My man that get the conversary every day
Never carry weight, my name carry weight
Love, hate, revolve like a .38
Love the paper but the fame in the way
Love the ladies but the queens hard to get
And I'm like a Lannister, run my town, that's seven kingdoms
And they'll never stop us, their only option is try to be us
