[George]
Nobody wants to be with someone who loves them
[Jerry]
No, people hate that
[George]
You want to be with somebody that doesn't like you
[Jerry]
Ideally
[George]
I am never saying 'I love you' again unless they say it first
Word


[Intro]
Nigga gotta tell you...
In the most endearing manner...that these jawns is for everybody

[Verse 1]
H-town, with J. Jr
I'm with J. Harden, I'm coolin'
And the way the broads are choosing us
I think I'm 'bout to move out Houston
Nigga, got that black bottle on me (unghh)
Black-black bottle on me (unghh)
Half the Bs in my suitcase
On the brown, I'll probably OD
Cause I'm in H-town and I'm crawlin'
My favorite bitch at Dream be stripping around 2
She love to say "I fuck with you, thank you for coming through"
She gon' get you in your feelings, then get you out of your loot
Oh, she don't love you

[Hook]
She don't ( she don't)
She don't ( she don't)
She don't ( she don't)
She don't love you no more
She don't ( she don't)
She don't ( she don't)

[Break: Seinfeld sample]
[Jerry]
Are you confident in the "I love you" return?
[George]
Fifty-fifty
[Jerry]
Cause if you don't get that return, that's a pretty big matzoh ball hanging out there
[George]
Aw, I've just got to say it once, everybody else gets to say it, why can't I say it?
[Elaine]
What, you never said it?
[George]
Once, to a dog

[Verse 2]
H-town, with J. Jr
I'm with J. Harden, I'm coolin'
And the, and the way the broads are choosing us
I think I'm 'bout to move out Houston
Nigga, got that Black Bottle on me
Black-black bottle on me
All the Bs that I brought in here
Is on the ground, I know we'll OD cause
I'm out H-town, just coolin'
My favorite bitch is ready, said "what did you try and do?"
I told her "It's whatever," she told me "Whatever" too
She told me it's a problem, well what's the problem - "The loot"
Yeah, she don't love you

[Hook]
She don't ( she don't)
She don't ( she don't)
She don't ( she don't)
She don't love you no more
She don't ( she don't)
She don't ( she don't)

She knows that I've been rolling up like a motherfucker

Damn

Syrup in bottles, be balancing my anxiety, hey
I ain't sipping to fit in with niggas
I go to Texas for women, and no Timberland weather
Mademoiselle, every nigga fetish for reals
Stay till the morning, my shit be snoring off with that pill
What a role model I be
I bet I lost respect when you saw me sweating off MD-
MA, blame it on the batch, girl, it's OK
Pop one to relax, see, this rap shit is so fake
Women so fake, all these niggas so fake
So who am I to ask 'bout ass, titties or whole names?
Now she giving government and her number away, (she don't) hey
Meaning she wanna do things not for public display, (she don't love you no more) hey
I'm off a high and low so my mind in a daze, (she don't) yeah
So won't you tell me you love me while I'm stuck on this wave?
And I'm up on a plane, bye
