[Intro: Wale]
I put that mack down, she put that Mac on
That mean I got more game than that Capcom
I applaud her, I take my hat off
I give her good wood, she call me 'Hacksaw'
Oh, Jim Duggan, Margiela, every color
This loving will get you grooved
It's so stellar, Stella
And you ain’t even gotta ask, might not be your first
But I’m better than your last

[Verse 1: Ravaughn]
When I give you this "sooweet", make a fellow spend money that he don’t got
Cause it’s that hot, better be good
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)
If I’mma give you this "too damn", show enough
Keep a man at home when I put it on
You better be good
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)

[Chorus: Ravaughn]
If I’ma give you this lord have mercy, keep you thirsty
I’ma need you to prove you’re worthy
You won’t find another like this
Since you know that you know what to do with it
See baby what I’ve got, one and only
And if you want this love, come and show me
But you gotta be good
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)
This love here is one and only
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)

[Verse 2: Ravaughn]
If I’ma give you this "whoa", can’t tell me no
When I put on a show, anything I asked for
You better
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)
If I’ma give you this all mine, no lie
So damn good make a grown man cry
You better be good, whoa
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)

[Chorus: Ravaughn]
If I’ma give you this lord have mercy, keep you thirsty
I’ma need you to prove you’re worthy
You won’t find another like this
Since you know that you know what to do with it
See baby what I’ve got, one and only
And if you want this love, come and show me
But you gotta be good
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)
This love here is one and only
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)

[Verse 3: Wale]
Ok, I know what to do with it
4 minutes cool nigga, I’m a fool with it
I’m more than happy, just throw it at me I'll go and get it
This Louie rag is a yellow flag, know I’m official
You know I’m giving you the biz girl, ha?
Don’t be denying what it is girl, ha?
Put it in your life and your ribs girl
Keep playing with me, you don’t get it like an intern
In turn, I’ll make your lips perk
No doubt toes out I'll makes them shits curl
Make your dreams real, change your whole world
Cause you won’t never wanna leave, you go girl

[Bridge: Ravaughn]
Don’t get it messed up, I’m special, (Special, special)
And not everyone knows how to care for me no
So if I give you a chance I’ma need you to show me
That you know what valuable is when you see it

[Chorus: Ravaughn]
If I’ma give you this lord have mercy, keep you thirsty
I’ma need you to prove you’re worthy
You won’t find another like this
Since you know that you know what to do with it
See baby what I’ve got, one and only
And if you want this love, come and show me
But you gotta be good
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)
This love here is one and only
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)
If I’ma give you this lord have mercy, keep you thirsty
I’ma need you to prove you’re worthy
You won’t find another like this
Since you know that you know what to do with it
See baby what I’ve got, one and only
And if you want this love, come and show me
But you gotta be good
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)
This love here is one and only
(You better, you better be good to me, You better, you better be good to me)
