[Verse 1: Wale]

They say
Wale from Maryland
Wale from Maryland
Shit is that the best you got hater
Go and tell everyone
Cause every one of ya'll wanna see us blow
So if it's by the means of me
By all means nigga let it go shit
I let it be known that we ain't all killers
Or niggafied niggas
That are scared of something different
See I'm something different
Cause I'm the sum of the district and it's surrounding inches
Although I'm surrounded by dumb numb headed niggas who feel
I gotta sleep within the confines of the land that us niggas don't even own
Joe
Sorry I don't rep the blocks
I'd rather rep the hearts and the souls
Than the blocks and roads of the white mans soul
I mean the white mans home
Yeah the white mans home
So all that hood reppin' ain't nothing
But a good reference to why we're alone
They ask why we ain't on yet
Nigga is you crazy
These niggas crazy
They hate a nigga that ain't even in it for the fame or the name
He in it for the nation's capital
He was raised in
But when the capital was raised
His mama made him move to where it was safer
Here go the haters
So I say this and make no more statements
Where the Redskins play at
Their stadium
Maryland
Where are both radio stations they playing
Maryland
When the white faces come buy space where we gonna be at
Maryland
Not to offend any of them just wanna clear it up so
Wale from Maryland
Wale from Maryland
I love it out here haters go and tell everyone
