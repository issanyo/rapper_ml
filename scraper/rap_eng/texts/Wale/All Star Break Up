[Verse 1]
If my pride was aside, I probably would text you first
But, If you could die from a broken heart you would drive a hearse
'Cause, every guy that has ever found you attractive and acted on it
Back peddles months after, that's when you've shown your worth
And I heard you love NBA niggas and now
You could track how much them niggas make and make rounds
At the All-Star break, a day or so by Valentine
So my advice if shorty doesn't know the game, she damin' y'all
And Mrs. Valentine, dollar signs have you satisfied
Do your goal's peak at a Rollie and FASHIONNOVA ad
And that don't mean to talk to you like a hoe 'cause nah
We both do what we want but if I want you
I must want you bad, right

[Pre-Chorus]
Just sayin', right
Your friends all gettin' married but yeah right
It's scary, right
That's real life
You might just catch you a spirit, you prayin' right

[Chorus]
I don't believe in Valentine
I don't believe in Valentine
I don't believe in Valentine
I don't believe in Valentine
I don't believe in

[Verse 2]
Look, pardon this pessimistic message I'm representin'
Yes yes, I know this bitch, I mean woman, I was gettin' reckless
But hol' up, lemme get one second, I spent so much in Fendi
She know I'm cool with Robyn, she bother me for the Fenty yeah
I'm tryna block the part of my heart that thrives on your affection
You tried the love, it's not enough, it's cars, it's money, attention
But, I'm way too flawed to judge you and I do my part to push you
Farther and farther from me, from my broads and all my problems
She say look 'Le, I'm sorry, my plane leaves in the mornin'
I'm trying to hit some parties and Staples for the performances
Maybe I'll see you Monday, thanks for this box of chocolates and
Roses you hold before me but court seats could get me 40
Thousand likes on my IG, someone I like just invited me
Plus I'm not even wifey, plus you 5'9, he's a giant no
Baby mama, I might could just make a blog and get popular
So the 14th was for us but fame and fortune excites me
My Valentine

[Outro]
I don't believe in Valentine
I don't believe in Valentine (I heard you love NBA niggas and now)
I don't believe in Valentine (I heard you love NBA niggas and now)
I don't believe in Valentine
You ever lost your main jawn to a point guard or a small forward
I don't believe in
I find it funny Cupid's busiest days, four days before the All-Star
It was fun while it lasted
I don't believe in
