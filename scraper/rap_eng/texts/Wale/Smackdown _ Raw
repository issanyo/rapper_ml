[Intro](with Jim Ross)
My god, it's a slobberknocker
Moons in the motherfucking sky, hey
Business is about to pick up

[Verse 1: Wale]
Alright, oh ya'll pie shaving when facing 'em
Brown straight, no chasing that
Some people thinking that we lost our deep
Our DMV, there's no replacing them
Love relation, our relationship
Black and gold the cases like the Saints is playing
And it's safe to say that I'm here to save you, but I'm never praising just pay for that
Bought seven, brought eight with us
Below seven, but that ain't with us
I give that bitch this Wang and I ain't bout to bring that broad no H&M
I said my [?] is ancient, better [?]
Bitch you ain't no gangster, you a lame for real
You a lame for sure, hate to pull your card and it's gone hurt the same just like a canker sore
Nigga fuck this game 'til my thang is sore
Nigga fuck the fame, make sure your name is strong
And I rep the squad, I never bang the [?]
But nigga brag or something I got a gang of combos
God dang, one small black man
So young, so witty, so talented
I done know a lot of men that [?]
Wrong nigga, I ain't going for no childish shit
Real life, I ain't going for no coward shit
Real life, I ain't really with the wilin' shit
Real life, I ain't really for the violence
But got banana clips if you niggas try and power trip
I'm the flyest the town I'm a product of
I got a lion heart, I got a line to call
Put your mind to half
Oh the irony this nigga been beside himself

[Outro: Jim Ross]
This is a amazing accomplishment
For the love of God will you stop the match?
I'll say this he's tougher than a government mule
Listen to the magic
