[Intro]
Listen, I said we gonna have a good time tonight
This evening I'm a take it, take it in (be right)
Say what, it's gon (be right)
Say what, it's gon (be right)
Yo Wale (be right)
Take them there nigga (be right)

[Verse 1: Wale]
You heard knowledge is power
Now you got a masters
To show you more massive then all them undergraduates
You know you so pretentious
You love pretending like your love for learning
Could be applied to this shit
The line for jobs is quite high, no isn't it
His pride diminishes
His pockets gone dry from the loans it was given him
The world got cold overnight now didn't it?
Post graduation now just a spokesman
For unemployed blacks who Sallie Mae debt
Every day was a Saturday, shit
Ain't nothing changed just a sadder day, dig

[Hook: Wale]
I know the world gets cold and the days get long
And the sun don't shine and you mind just wonders
Why me, I say it cause we number one
This why we get up in the morning
It's gon be alright (be right)
It's gon be alright (be right)
It's gon be alright (be right)
Believe that
It's gon be alright (be right)

[Verse 2: Wale]
Get away, from it all he wanted to do
Suicide is easy, he got nothin to prove
Stuck in the pool, and it's suckin him in
It's like a black hole, whole fucking abyss
Come here to picture how he bumping his fist
Ain't that a bloody bitch, she wasn't a bloody bitch
She laid, her body's gone tardy
Knowing you was getting by hardly
Knowing you can no longer party
Knowing you'll be followed by the bills like helotry
You're falling slowly
As you depart from your homies, earlier
You got a baby boy or girl in there
Years back you believed that the world was fair
But now it's more declare
You see the world is scary
And now the present got you struggling
But use tomorrow as a mull again, church

[Hook: Wale]
I know the world gets cold and the days get long
And the sun don't shine and you mind just wonders
Why me, I say it cause we number one
This why we get up in the morning
It's gon be alright (be right)
It's gon be alright (be right)
It's gon be alright (be right)
Believe that
It's gon be alright (be right)

[Verse 3: Wale]
All men cheat, baby girl been through it
And niggas ain't shit but you already knew that
It's cause of you, see, you let him do that
You let him a sleaze you, but money tend to do that
Right, now you say you don't care
Now you finna cut your hair, you waiting to excel
Looking through your phone book, couldn't get a cell
Rebound slow you down but you gotta exhale
See, and now life seem hard
Still looking through your call log like "did he call yet? "
You get your girl for something tight tomorrow
You going to the club though, you soaking in sorrow
Heartbroken obviously, there's not tomorrow
When the present so powerful where the hour seem longer
I know it hurt but life's not perfect
Happiness is hard sometimes you gotta work for it

[Hook: Wale]
I know the world gets cold and the days get long
And the sun don't shine and you mind just wonders
Why me, I say it cause we number one
This why we get up in the morning
It's gon be alright (be right)
It's gon be alright (be right)
It's gon be alright (be right)
Believe that
It's gon be alright (be right)
