[Hook: Wale]
New Shaq flow
Everybody ain't trickin', but they got toast
Nigga, we not dope boys, we just ji-dope
Without a pot stove, nigga, make that pot roast

[Verse 1: Wale]
Nigga, I'm a humble nigga
Still come through and kick it
With the very same niggas that I came through with it
A miracle to girls with that lyrical appeal
Keep it real, y'all playing like American Apparel
J's DS, don't be lacin' them up
Y'all be makin' some money, but y'all be makin' shit up
Y'all be welling, embellishing, but forever irrelevant
They be saying whatever, but when they see me, they suckin' dick
It's hard to just love a woman, it's easy to fuck a bitch
Hard to think shit is peasy, seeing what Puffy did
That's why I be talkin' for every feature and cover appearence
Cause when I was hungry, you motherfuckers ain't wanna hear it
Grind mode, shorty said that she tryin' go
That ex box, ain't talking the gaming console
Y'all slow, my shows be all sold
In Norway, it's no way you're in Oslo
Ridin' with the Buddha, rockin' the Medusa
Got a lotta haters, they ain't cool enough to do it
Fuck a pistol, got a shooter, I am not thuggin'
Your little mixtape cool but nigga, get a budget

[Hook: Wale]

[Refrain: Wale x4]
Turn me up yo
Slight work to me

[Verse 2: Wale]
I put the city on, I kept the city on
Shout out to Cool & Dre, made another million
We headed to the store, couple packs of the Swisher
Fuck a Benz, bag a bitch in a Maxima, chillin'
Ain't trickin' if you got it, I'mma get it
I ain't sayin' Dick Bavetta, but these niggas not official
As I, all these niggas is R's
They like giving a cough drop to a nigga with SARS
Some niggas is real, a lot of niggas is soft
Lotta bitches be scarred, so I be sittin' in my car
I'm low-key, the most freaks that know me for reason
So 'bout that doe cheese, they won't be competing
Meaning, it's easy, we M.O.B.ing
So much that girls at the bank call me Stevie
Wonder, fuck ya, bad motherfucker
One man band but Lil' Raz on production
Come up in the booth salivating for the supper
And I never finished school cause Sallie Mae's just a hustler
YEAH

[Hook: Wale]

[Refrain: Wale x4]

[Outro: Wale]
Bad bitches in the front
Real niggas in the back
