Let me test your cool, can you take a stroke or two?
It's adult swim when I go up in, until the oxygen is through
Put away your cool, spend the day in your pool
It's adult swim when I go up in it when we're lost in your world
Run it back, let me test your cool, can you take a stroke or two?
It's adult swim when I go up in, until the oxygen is through
Put away that cool, yeah, spend a day in your pool, girl
It's adult swim, if I drown in it, I'll be lost in your world, oh
Down, down, baby, oh, girl I don't wanna float
Deep sea, baby, soaking everywhere she go
Down, down, baby, oh, there goes another, oh
Squeeze both legs and oh, she'll never let me go

[Verse 1]
Got a thing for the nasty type today
Got a thing for the classy type today
Say she love it from the back or side
But hold back sometimes cause it be passin' by her ribs
I don't care if she going both ways
I don't care if her boyfriend is mad
Sittin' here with the noise in the room
Guaranteed that she gonna have a splash
Sundresses in the moonlight
Skinny dipping when the moon right, uh
Somebody better call a life guard
Cause I'm liable to need revival
Resuscitated nigga, let me lay up with you
When I'm going, hope you got a life saver with you
Ride with a nigga, just fly lil nigga and
Ya'll not like you got flight bookin' issues, hold up
Continue, wild lil nigga finna drown in a minute
Lookin' like Skye Townsend, I'm flyin' in it
Have you ever seen a fountain or pool this real?
Any deeper then I'm going need scuba gear
Kinda sleepy cause I'm deep and I ain't cold or nothin'
Kinda sleepy cuz I'm deep and I can show you something
Write a poem or somethin, kiss you on the stomach
Either way you wet, I got the pool this summer

Deep sea, baby, soaking everywhere she go
Down, down, baby, oh, there goes another, oh
Squeeze both legs and oh, she'll never let me go
Down, down, down, now, hey

[Bridge]
Walk tall with your chest out
Paint your lips with the ruby
Tell Puff you ain't walking for the cheesecake
It's okay to be bougie
Six inch heels, when you step out
If they a knife, you an UZI
Tell Khaled you the best now
It's okay to be bougie

[Verse 2]
I sent a text message to your fine ass
You left a wet spot to remind that
Hm, slow whine and rewind that
Now forever on your mind, let me find out, hm, shit
Evacuate the scene by that last scream
Cause she know it's wash day and these her last jeans
Turn the pool to a lake if it gotta be
And I keep her wheels turnin' 'til she tired of me, dive with me

[Bridge]
Walk tall with your chest out
Paint your lips with the ruby
Tell Puff you ain't walking for the cheesecake
It's okay to be bougie
Six inch heels, when you step out
If they a knife, you an UZI
Tell Khaled you the best now
It's okay to be bougie

[Outro]
It don't matter, it don't matter
It's okay to be bougie
It don't matter, it don't matter
I don't mind if you bougie
