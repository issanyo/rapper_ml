[Intro: Wale]
I got every right to feel myself, right, baby?
True story, right?
I told her I’d pick her up, she said, “Cool”
She said, “What time,” I said, “2”
Then she asked me what time she’d be back
I said, “2:30”
She said, “Pssh, like that?”
I said, “Pssh, I’ve been like that”
That’s a whole tomorrow, plus I threw in thirty
So grab your Louis ‘cause time’s burning

[Pre-Chorus: Wale]
Ain’t tryna do much
But you know the bottles on us
The bottles ain’t much, you’re smiling too much
I’m tryna do somethin’, yeah
I’m probably too much
I party too much
In the parkin’ lot, the lobby to the plane
4 to 4:30, it’s over one day

[Chorus: Wale]
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can make her good the great in one day
I can make her good the great in one day
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can make her good the great in one day
I can make her good, good, good, good

[Verse 1: Wale]
Show some support, yeah
A real one across the board, yeah
Chill, shawty, I know you annoyed, look
They comic books to you, I’m Rob Report
Mi amor, I’m popular
I’m not a heartthrob, but the broads in love, yeah
At the club, the bosanova
Them Barry’s a moment
Won’t embarrass you, baby girl
But them broads with us
Telly is goin’ spill
I hit it to Lauryn Hill
I really fix up your swag
I get all your old bags and give it to Goodwill, woo!

[Bridge: Phil Ade]
She don’t think, just go with it
A little drink, little smoke with it
Do anything for a dollar though
If she want it, then she gon’ get it
Have another, girl, it’s on me
Bet you’ll get drunk, then call me
In the club all night long
This how it goes when the lights off

[Pre-Chorus: Wale]
Ain’t tryna do much
But you know the bottles on us
The bottles ain’t much, you’re smiling too much
I’m tryna do somethin’, yeah
I’m probably too much
I party too much
In the parkin’ lot, the lobby to the plane
4 to 4:30, it’s over one day

[Chorus: Wale]
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can make her good the great in one day
I can make her good the great in one day
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can make her good the great in one day
I can make her good, good, good, good

[Verse 2: Wale]
Show me your worth, mmm
Double Cs you put in your purse, cute
Hermes might get you the Birkin
I give you the world if you intelligent first
Get your confidence and your relevance up, mmm
Tell younger women it’s better to love, mmm
I’m trine keep all our chemistry good
We mentally good
If it’s negative energy I’m gonna give you the deuce
You really a real one
So I’m givin’ you real love
And I tell you look good
You lookin’ at IG, you tell me it ain’t enough
You lie

[Bridge: Phil Ade]
She don’t think, just go with it
A little drink, little smoke with it
Do anything for a dollar though
If she want it, then she gon’ get it
Have another, girl, it’s on me
Bet you’ll get drunk, then call me
In the club all night long
This how it goes when the lights off

[Pre-Chorus: Wale]
Ain’t tryna do much
But you know the bottles on us
The bottles ain’t much, you’re smiling too much

[Chorus: Wale]
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can make her good the great in one day
I can make her good the great in one day
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can turn her good to great in one day
I can make her good the great in one day
I can make her good, good, good, good
