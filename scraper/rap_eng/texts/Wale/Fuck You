[Verse 1: Wale]
Real nigga, pardon whoever feel different
Only feel sorry for crack babies and rape victims
Pushing my way to the top but this time it feel different
DC ain't been this hot since Ronald Reagan made a killing
Ambition mixing liquor with life's lemons
Despite my dark days I feel I'm the brightest of thinkers
Frequently hated, either that or misunderstood
But a wise woman told me "it's okay to know you good"
They call it arrogance but I think it's passionate
And I think this happens when you rap and don't exaggerate
Shawty open your soul, pray that protools agree though
Me and my pupils is mutual they not focused as me though
See my flow is the nicest and my ho is the baddest
And the sex will lock her down see my stick is the gavel
Catalog growing, rappers skedaddle move over
She reluctantly fucking, she's an adamant blower
I'm a passionate poet, moonlight as rapping Folarin
Horse is missing on my Polo cause my tag is enormous
I ain't cocky I'm just proud of me
So why these niggas acting like I ain't allowed to be

[Chorus]
Fuck you
When a nigga in the room, give a nigga room
Nigga, fuck you
Yeah, just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude
Fuck you
When a nigga in the room, give a nigga room
Nigga, fuck you
Yeah, just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude

[Verse 2]
Real nigga, pardon whoever feel different
How I grow to be 5'8
But it's still my little niggas
Chanel slippers on my bitches like you go love
And I love your brain but I think I'll never know enough
Argue with twitter niggas who insignificant
But its just simply my interest to intricately ridicule niggas
Proud of it all defensive fuck I'm rocking alone
Say what you want I'm Immature like Roger go home
Hard headed hot headed I admit it
But I'll be damned if they defeat me like a fucking prosthetic
Ha, Wale you so arrogant
Rozay told me break a leg no wonder why I care again
Stunting in a pair of Tiffs I don't mean a pair of Tims
Two bitches named Tiffany I left them with a pair of kids
Rare shit, trend setting yea I be the best
OD'd on that Mitchell-Ness you thought it was '03 again
Hold up yea we the best
Roll wit Ace, Khaled and them
Roll up niggas. weed like sex
Don't you leave a seed in there
Reading shit my critics say
Pitchfork doesn't need a plate
Not hungry for my poetry
They fasting they won't leave me ate
Six and a half, Optimistic this isnt bad
It's different now, Before the faith niggas was "WHAM"
Carelessly whispering all they nickel opinions at me
Tell all my haters call they neighbor get they minions at me
A couple labels threw some millions yet they still ain't grab me
Nigga's talk they'd attacked me but wouldn't steal a taxi
Ha, and I ain't smug I'm just proud of me
Why they acting like a nigga ain't allowed to be

[Chorus]
Fuck you
When a nigga in the room, give a nigga room
Nigga, fuck you
Yeah, just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude
Fuck you
When a nigga in the room, give a nigga room
Nigga, fuck you
Yeah, just you
Tell them people we ain't leaving go adjust dude

[Talking]
Ambition is definitely on the way
