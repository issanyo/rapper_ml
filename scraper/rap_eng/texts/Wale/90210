[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nosebleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210

[Verse 1]
Ms. Rodeo, tell me where your day go
Part-time waitress, she really want to make it
In the "City of Lights", it's hard to see clear
She don't really care about anyone advice
And nothing here's real, and everyone's alike
Cause everyone dreams of the millionaire's life
She barely eats at all, if she do she eats light
Indulging a meal when a toilet's insight
Expose those fries, can't hold those down
To read for Seven Pounds, you must release several pounds
This is Heaven on Hell
This is how she want to live
But she ain't really tripping, she's on Beverly Hills

[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nosebleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210

[Verse 2]
Just another day out in Beverly Hills
She sing, model, and dance, but can't sit still
Believing the screens or anything there
But reality shows ain't real
So pretentious with no potential
She goes to catch up, although her rent's up
In her defense she a part of the crowd
She going to borrow some money
So she can party at Chows
It's apart of her goal
It's all she knows
Graduated from Ros√©, addicted to blow
Addicted to stardom, a wish to blow
So she kisses the stars
And she gives them a blow
After every show, a dream she hold
Inhibitions is gone, she just want to be known
She want to be know, she just want to be known
Pulling down her skirt
"I never done this before"
Nah

[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nosebleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210

[Verse 3]
You know big-breast girls
Never ever pay rent
They meet them rich boys
Throw D's on that bitch
Lease on the whip
Beach on the weekend
Hotel suite, room keys is a gift
Dream of the fame or a ring on her finger
Now you just a whore to the known entertainers
Word spreads fast that your knees spread quick
The sun's always out
But it's clouds over here
Look, cocaine addiction, apartment eviction
To add to the list of Beverly Hills victims
Hold on you can see my vision
Next time you look down on a nigga

[Chorus]
And she throws up whatever she eats
She leave the bathroom with a nosebleed
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
She live her whole life like TV
And she would do anything for everything
Regular girl, celebrity dreams
She is 90210
