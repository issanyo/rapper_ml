And it feels like the worst aggression is passive
They were my niggas but, observe "were" is a word is past tense
Now they act fickle cuz I guess they hate to see me follow my passion
When everything they follow's either ass or fashion
Now I'm sitting, wishing for them days way back when
You ain't diss me when I said click me on Datpiff
Ain't that a bitch, is this game so strange,
You forgot when you said things ain't gon' change
Always be my brother and I'm always gonna love you
But you started looking up to me as if I was above you,
Ironic cuz I tried to keep it humble
I'm talking but it feels just like a mumble
Telling me to speak up and gain a little confidence
Coming from the Glee Club, I just wanted accomplishments
Then I got some and you thought I got cocky shit
Started doing right so tell me what's wrong with this
When the kids wants an autograph and bitches want a picture
Coming home from the road friends say they missed you
Then you leave and they diss you...
