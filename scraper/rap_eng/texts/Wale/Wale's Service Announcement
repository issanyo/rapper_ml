[Intro]
Wale
You gonna be the one to make it, man
You gonna put DC on the map
You gonna do it
And I just try my best, you know what I'm saying
I'm gonna pave the way for everybody else
I know I'm good, y'all know I'm good
So we good, right
Allow me to introduce myself, it's like

[Verse 1]
W, A to the L E
I'm hot on screens like Hebel at LZs
I'm trying to be the biggest thing since Elvis
But haters keep postin' close to my pelvis
Ugh, y'all gay, y'all Zed, keep 'em movin'
I've been a young boy since a high school junior
Junior, you're so sophomore
You're nothing but a little cud, gimme that chorus
No love for for a woman, no, I think that I should warn you
Your girlfriend got my poster in her dorm room
And I don't post that ?
At McDonald's at Howard, I ain't even at campus
I cover, I am literally Pampers
We sharp like nails, then you better bring your hammer
Run that, hold beef like lunch bags
I carry so many broads, I got a hunchback

[Bridge]
Now, I'm tryin' to be like the humble dude
Like, you know what I'm saying
But I'm really better than most of y'all, well, all of y'all
Yeah, all of you
I'm better than all of y'all
But, it's cool though, but I got
You know what I'm saying
I'm really trying to make this thing work out
Cause they tell me to be humble, so I do it
But he know I'm the best, y'all know I'm the best

[Verse 2]
No, Aliz√© ain't lie
Them dudes out hatin', but they ain't I
Shit, you know the cops ain't on it
I ride through the quarters and this guy's like Portis
Oh, you butterflies, I'm a hornet
I hone my tone 'til I blow like Cornet
Or clarinet, turn that shirt through a hairnet
Everybody give themselves a title they ain't earn yet
Yeah, I let you put it together
Youngin working with a cause like pudding in sweaters?
Not Jello, I'm staying out fo jail, though
Fiends love white like Othello, 'ello
There's no saving him, a notch below famous here
My buzz thicker than the line at Paladians
And I ain't fakin' it, holla at your mons
I know I'm good for it, but I'm bringin' 'bout four
We out like tobacco when the car get hotboxed
Wale skip the line, this is hopscotch
Flow Coca-Cola mixed with the pop rocks
I pop Loc, make them break like Pop-a-Lock
The brake lights on the car gonna stop, watch
The flow brighter than a siren, I can stop cops
I'm Wale, you know you know me from the you know
The rap or the hip-hop, I give off the judo
You know, I kill beats, this is euthanasia
I rock Bapes like the youth in Asia
I'm too fast, man you can't race him
My black ink poison paper, I'm truly racist
Face it
