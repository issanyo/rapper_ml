[Verse 1: Wale]
Mama ain't raise no fool, true
But me and my brother never made it out school
She prayed on me passing that bar
Its way different ma you see em passin' out bars
The definition of a jetsetter
I'm Hip-Hop still livin' like a Goodfella'
Castle and crooks sweater
And the queen never trip she drive away faster than you look nigga
Have you seen Ibiza with Beaches that look like Eva with D cups
Or a beach like an HBO Feature at night, a quarter-pound of sand in my un-released nikes
Bitch say im hot smoking on by the night nigga you ain't know about The life
When shit gets heavier than Norbit's wife we still gotta Spit some enourmous ryhmes
Niggas more than like, its more than likely when you return home you ignored by the gorgeous wife
And she Feel slighted and you dont want to fight with her cuz' you tired
But Now it's back to the lab 45 messages right after you land
Feet feel Swollen you gone off the Xanax and risking your life with the mic in your hand

[Hook: Wale and Jazmine Sullivan]
We on a world tour, Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every ghetto with a mic in my hand
New York, VA, DC, get paid
We on a world tour, Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every ghetto with a mic in my hand
London, Tokyo, we gon' take you all around the globe
Sing it to em' shorty
Its like La da da da da da, dada da da dada da da
Dada da da dada da da, dada da da dada da da
Its like La da da da da da, dada da da dada da da
Dada da da dada da da, dada da da dada da da

[Verse 2: Wale]
See Dre did Scotland and everybody jocked him
I did Scotland and got no props for it
Nah, that just fucked up my J's which fucked up my day, rocked wellies on stage
Freezing my willie off, no hotel, I'm back on the plane while they was like go "whale"
I'm so well ahead of them I'm unpaved, I did justice to Justice mon frere
One thing that you niggas must acknowledge, I leave beats like the pants on Scottish: Kilt
It's how it's dealt, I've been over more water then than Michael Phelps
It's harder when you by yourself, my nigga Bun B couldn't help
My nigga Rhyme Fest never think about self cause he think about wealth like Finch do MILF's on American Pie
It's hard to have American pride when most of your money's made out of them lies
The other half is out of them lines, they wanna make a nigga like "Ah fuck"
Rewinding so much that his arm hurt, relying so much that it's over paid em' and they hate em' but they wrong for it D.C. no hooges im on first

[Hook: Wale]
We on a world tour, Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every ghetto with a mic in my hand
New York, VA, DC, get paid
We on a world tour, Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every ghetto with a mic in my hand
London, Tokyo, we gon' take you all around the globe
Sing it to em' shorty

[Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
You know that when
We give it, we give it hard
No half steppin' baby
This is who we are
Every word, every word
Written from the heart
Wrote, wrote, wrote
Broken from my heart
To get with it, get with it
Let me see your hands
If you with us
We on a world tour boogie tomorrow
We're praying then can give it to me, pray in the bar

[Hook: Wale]
We on a world tour, Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every ghetto with a mic in my hand
New York, VA, DC, get paid
We on a world tour, Wale your man
Hustlin' in each and every ghetto with a mic in my hand
London, Tokyo, we gon' take you all around the globe
Sing it to em' shorty

[Outro: Jazmine Sullivan]
It's like ta ladada data
Dadada tadadadata
Dadada tadadadata
Dadada tadadadata
