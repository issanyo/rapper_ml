[Intro]
That's my name don't forget it
It's not a game
Hold ya dame
Cause my thang somethin' vicious (Wale!)
Cause my thang somethin' vicious (Wale!)
Cause my thang somethin' vicious (Wale!)
That's my name don't forget it
I'm not from Northeast, but I guarantee I groove her

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl

[Verse 1]
Yeah it's Wale, you prolly know me from the rap
Home of the terrapins, slangers of the crack
Uptown roamers to southside riders
I bump, sellin' dro on the boat like pirates
Shake it for me darlin', na I ain't dancin
Ignorant as ever, don't be trippin' where my hands is
Handcuff a chick? Nah, bamma niggas grip broads
Me I'm finna hit it and ditch it and that's a dig ya'll

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl

[Verse 2]
I said, please don't step on the shoes cause I'm twisted
Those SBs you seen is 350
And we lifted, rollin' straight swishers
Rollers get a whiff and get back like swishes
Never hit the backboard, rollin' up and pack four
And that broad gets crank like backyard
She back it on me, man, I ain't 'bout the paper
When a broad try to play a playa, this is what you say
You say

[Bridge]
Come here girl, I said
Come here girl, I said
Come here girl, I said
Come here girl, I said

[Verse 3]
Dig it, she under dug it, I dig it she under covers
I give her the diggin' and then she really gon' be in love
But I ain't gon' dig it if she ain't really with it
Got no times for the fakin', when she sayin' she gon' give it, like

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl

[Verse 4]
Well I ain't spendin' cash for it, I don't even ask for it
I'm bad and I'm flyer then a passport
The ambassador of rap for the capital
Prolly gon' grab it when I grind into the back of her like

[Bridge]
Come here girl, I said
Come here girl, I said
Come here girl, I said
Come here girl, I said
Come here girl, I said
Come here girl, I said

[Chorus]
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, shake it, shake it
Shake it, you gon' move girl
