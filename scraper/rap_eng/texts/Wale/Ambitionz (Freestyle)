[Verse - Wale]

Sick and tired of being under rated
So I give my love to my lady and pray for all these babies
New York city to Lagos, you hardly out of stated
My money quite loquacious, so commas riddle my statements
Would you rather sell a millie or be known as the greatest?
Be financially stable or busting tables for paper
Hah, Wale Folarin, ballin in case you didn’t knew
After this eighth be high like out of middle school
This shit get critical, always gotta get different one
See I tried to spread the D, welcome to my run and gun
Misunderstood, respected, so I give it all my effort
Hang on my words, but more concerned with my latest necklace
Instrumental from Lexus, change is what they expected
I just brought 'em more audience, shawty wait till November
Be that day to remember trying to chance their perception
Bet they cancel they date like waking up late with a pimple
Ambition for life, dreaming bigger than life
See niggas lose it all and follow that liquor advice
Dippers and pipers, it's sad shawty, but this is life
Frequently taking lives cause they not taking advice
And I’m a stray rider, never fuck with bitches in Lucaya
I am not in competition with these liars, I’m tired of 'em
Top five niggas, I'm eyeing whoever vying for it
If y’all important, I come at you, firing poems
If I ain't the dopest then joker's either lying or smoking
The lion has spoken, the eye's lower, the higher the potency
See I ain't the coach, but I make a girl run till she open
I’ll catch my breath a little, money alright where I’m from
But respect is more real, and ambition the key
Yea I'm missin some sleep
I'm on my grizzly, ain't know way I'm missing Thabeet
Wordplay for days, smoking haze for days
Cooking up loud pack, yeah I can make the soufflé
Y’all ain’t ready to play this big time, you Teddy Dupay
Got a chick from JA puffing that Lucky Dube
Shoutout to Puffy my nigga, but Nuvo getting me straight 
Driving so crucial, move over, you never I never need brakes
Never need breaks, "No days off" my slogan, ho
Rolling with my entourage, I bet I get your Sloan and go
High as fuck, no Vinny Chase, I just need my Henny straight
When I sold that 28, it put me in another state of mind
The mind, nigga grind, never dumb, fuck is up?
I give my love to this game, but I will never give a fuck
Give it up, who y'all got, hope is me, hope it be
They be mad, they not real, they won't fight, that's Hogan beef
Look at how my totem seat, I'm just tryna show approve
Told my mama in '03 I ain’t going back to school
Make some move, ambition I’m on a level
Niggas is working forever my bars
Niggas talk with limited service
I ain’t no drug dealer, theses ain’t no trap lyrics
I’m just a young nigga caught up in this rap business
I ain’t no drug dealer, I ain’t no trap nigga
I’m just a young nigga advocating ambition
