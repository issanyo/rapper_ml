[Verse 1]
I want a brand new whip
I think that these niggas would too
When you makin' money and you actin' so new
I ain't really fly, I just copped some Bape shoes
I don't really like lies I don't watch the fucking news
How you got a girl but she fucking me tonight
Can't front with the lames you ain't even living right
My team say, "fuck 12"
I'm just smokin' Js tonight
Feeling like the young nigga Dynamite

[Hook]
I want that new 'Rari
I want that new money
Smoke too much I got munchies
Back then she ain't even want me
I want that new 'Rari
I need some new money
Smoke too much I got munchies
Back then she ain't even want me
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now

[Sample]

[Hook]
I need that new 'Rari
I need that new money
Smoke too much I got munchies
Back then she ain't even want me
I need that new 'Rari
I need that new money
Smoke too much I got munchies
Back then she ain't even want me
Look at me now, look at me now
Look at me now, look at me now

[Verse 2]
East side shawty got a check
[?] a little piff for the night
Nigga locked up can't cop the Lam
Don't want me but she want sex
I'm on the flight just chasing that jet
You know the top good, feel it in your legs
You know the top good, feel it in your legs
You know the top good, feel it in your legs

[Hook]
I need that new 'Rari
I need that new money
Smoke too much I got munchies
Back then she ain't even want me
I need that new 'Rari
I need that new money
Smoke so much I got munchies
Back then she ain't even want me
Look at me now, look at me now
