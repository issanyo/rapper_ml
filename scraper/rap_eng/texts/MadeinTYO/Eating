[Verse 1]
Oh, oh
11-19, she tastes like ice cream
My son wakin' up, he havin' light dreams
Body hella warm
11-19, she tastes like ice cream
My son wakin' up, he havin' light dreams
Body hella warm, she rubbin' on my arm
Takin' off her clothes, she takin' off my robe
I'm going down
You coming now
Chanel on my chain
I'm glowing up

[Chorus]
They say you are what you eat, girl, I'm eating you
I'm getting off, that's just me, girl, I'm fucking you
Biting on your neck, girl, I'm touching you
House on the hills, girl, she love the view

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, sing me somethin' tonight
Sing me somethin' tonight
Sing me somethin' tonight
She rollin' up, I'm high
They say you are what you eat, girl, I'm eating you
They say you are what you eat, girl, I'm eating you

[Verse 2]
I wanna touch you ona flight, boo
I wanna fuck you when we fight, boo
I wanna fuck you on sight, boo
I love everything about you
Tryna take you out the house, boo
Then get you on the couch, boo
You inspire me a lot, boo
I'm 'bout to finish up the album

[Chorus]
They say you are what you eat, girl, I'm eating you
I'm getting off, that's just me, girl, I'm fucking you
Biting on your neck, girl, I'm touching you
House on the hills, girl, she love the view

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Sing me somethin' tonight
Sing me somethin' tonight
Sing me somethin' tonight
She rollin' up, I'm high
They say you are what you eat, girl, I'm eating you
They say you are what you eat, girl, I'm eating you

[Outro]
I'm eating you
I'm eating you
I'm eating you
