[Intro: MadeinTYO]
Good morning Nessly
Ooh

[Chorus: MadeinTYO & Nessly]
I jump in the money with a lifevest, yeah
Fuck a bitch who speak a foreign dialect, yeah
Yeah, your baby never opened up my iMessage
I'm a scientist, I take that check and dissect

[: MadeinTYO]
Baby, what the fuck you playin' with my feelings for?
You be in your bedroom on your phone like it's ouija board
I done told you why we cleanup, I don't see no me no more

[Verse 1: MadeinTYO]
I wonder why she don't reply but why the fuck she read it for
Fresh off a breakup, had to get my bank up
All these niggas bankrupt, my last bitch a A-cup
My new bitch a D-cup, codeine in my teacup
Buy 'em by the dozen, we hear they come cheaper
She ride that brazillan like she got [?]
Now to every civilian, I'm a late night lookin' creeper
And my bitch tiddies so big, she gon' stretch out all of my t-shirts
Like a successful bakery, all that cake all on her keister, yeah

[: MadeinTYO]
Baby, what the fuck you playin' with my feelings for?
You be in your bedroom on your phone like it's ouija board
I done told you why we cleanup, I don't see no me no more

[: ]
Okay, I lied
Baby, that's why

[Chorus: MadeinTYO & Nessly]
I jump in the money with a lifevest, yeah
Fuck a bitch who speak a foreign dialect, yeah
Yeah, your baby never opened up my iMessage
I'm a scientist, I take that check and dissect

[Verse 2: Nessly]
Oh, yeah
What the fuck you really, really waiting for?
I jump in that Gucci, buy the whole store
Off-White jeans, feel like Virgil
Told you a lot of things, yeah, I ain't tryna hurt you
Know that you be hatin', I smoke purple
Make too much money, canâ€™t get trouble
Jump up in that pussy with no lifevest
Makin' money, swervin' with no license
Tired of all these lame niggas bitin'
Waitin' in line over [?]
I cannot lie, I wanna try
[?], your pussy fire
You cross the line, ten times five
Love when you ride, you too damn fire
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: MadeinTYO & Nessly]
I jump in the money with a lifevest, yeah
Fuck a bitch who speak a foreign dialect, yeah
Yeah, your baby never opened up my iMessage
I'm a scientist, I take that check and dissect

[: Nessly]
Oh yeah
I just wanna know who you hit first
When it's all comin' down
When it's all comin' down
When it's all, yeah
When it's all comin' down
I just wanna know who you hit first
When it's all comin' down, yeah
When it's all comin' down
When it's all comin' down (down)
