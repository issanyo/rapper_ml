Yeah
Hey
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

My clique so cocky
Go dumb like Ozzy (Ozzy)
Your bitch want me
I hit like Rocky
You never saw me
You hear me knocking
I hit the target
Yeah, gotta keep the model in the gym, sweat
I need another bottle of this gin, yeah
I feel that clit torpedo when I swim, yeah
She lick the tip and then I stick it in, yeah

Movies with my bitch, no PG, boy
I pour the shots and I direct the scenes, boy
She pop that pussy and a Perc for me, boy
She said that dick feel like LSD, she trippin’ yah!

This the beat, sit tall got it drunk
Speakers kick kick kick in the trunk
Off the sip, sip, sip, in this zone
Diamonds drip, drip, drip, waterfall (drip)

Drip, drip, drip, waterfall
Gotta sip, sip, sip, on that lime
Diamonds drip, drip, drip, waterfall
Off the sip, sip, sip, I’m in love (love!)

Getting lit, lit, lit and I dip (dip, I got)
Got your bitch wet, tripping of the drip
Flick my wrist, flick, flick, I don’t sit (at the time)
Copy 413’in for the dick (that’s right)

Looking back (back)
Gucci in the rave (skrr)
Lose my life (life)
Bitch get out my face (bye)
Lemon light
Leaning by the case
Waste my time (time)
We going out of space (high)

Target, lens
Bend it, Benz
Bitches, free
Lit, please
Diamonds, rocks
Flex, ew
Disgusting how I let it drip (drip)
It swallow and trickle

I wanna be fucked with the lip
[?] fit
I need a bitch with a whip
I need a bitch on my dick
I take my time on the clit
I lick it and nibble a bit

This the beat, sit tall got it drunk
Speakers kick kick kick in the trunk
Off the sip, sip, sip, in this zone
Diamonds drip, drip, drip, waterfall (drip)

Drip, drip, drip, waterfall
Gotta sip, sip, sip, on that lime
Diamonds drip, drip, drip, waterfall
Off the sip, sip, sip, I’m in love (love!)
