[Verse 1: Madeintyo]

Yeah I tell a bitch if she fucking late
She should come to my crib, nah don't be late
Hol' up little shawdy bitch yeah you're too thick
Now old bitch lookin' stupid as shit
If I pull my shawdy then you know that she be gone
Trips to Cali, out in valley, smoking on the strong
You know them niggas lookin so you know they gonna hate
Vintage tee, Harajuku, coppin some Bape
Slide to the island just to fuck with the view
Tryna' cash out, man shout, young move
Need a bad bitch, nah not no average
Young savage should of kept the tie in

Tell a bitch if she fucking late don't be late
Hold up little shawdy, bitch, yeah you're too damn thick
Now my old bitch looking stupid as shit
If I pull my shawdy then you know that she be gone
Trips to Cali, out in valley, smoking on some strong
Yeah you know them niggas lookin so they gonna hate
Vintage tee harajuku coppin some bape
Slide to the island just to fuck with the view
Tryna' cash out, man shout, young move
Need a bad bitch, no average (yeah)

[Chorus]
Been a savage
Hey, hey, always been a savage [8x]
