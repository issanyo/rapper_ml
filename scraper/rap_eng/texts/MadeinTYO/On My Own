Hook:
Lately I've been doin' me
All I wanna do is succeed
Nobody's fuckin' with me though, so for now I'm on my own
(BlakeShawn & Amelia McCowan-Martin)
I'm all alone
I'm on my own
I'm all alone
I'm on my own
(BlakeShawn & James Dittemore)
I'm all alone
I'm on my own
I'm all alone
I'm on my own
(Just BlakeShawn)
I'm on my own

Verse 1 (BlakeShawn):
Solo dolo to the casket
My life is so tragic
Addicted to this music, I'm a fuckin' addict
Mentality of a savage
Tryna tell you I ain't average
Just wanna live comfortably, forget tryna live lavish

(Thunder)

Verse 2 (BlakeShawn, with ad-libs by James Dittemore):
I just wanna be free (James: free)
I just wanna be me (James: me)
Society tells me this and that, man I'm just tryna succeed (James: whoo!)
I owe my life to music, If I didn't have it I would lose it (James: Unintelligible)
I was actin' stupid, I was goin' through it (James: through it)

Verse 2, pt 2 (Just BlakeShawn):
Suicidal thoughts, from the basement
I dropped out wasn't goin' places
My heart was really breakin'
Yeah, my faith was really shaken
Really wanted to end it all, I'm really surprised I didn't do it
Fucked around, got in legal trouble, I was actin' really foolish

Foolish

Yeah
