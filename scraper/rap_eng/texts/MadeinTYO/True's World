I love The Private Club
Good job 1st!
True's World

[Verse]
Yo, sittin’ in the studio
Whole bunch of bands out (skrt)
XXL chose a real nigga
Can’t let my fans down (oh)
Thick lil bih, sheesh, tryna pull my pants down (yuh)
Momma still help out
Even though I’m the man now
Still got problems at home even though I’ve got grands now (yuh)
True tryna crawl, can’t wait 'til he stand now (yeah)
Wake up right, then I get it
If you talkin money then I’m with it (racks)
She bitin’ on my neck when I hit it
Send her to Gwinnett when I finish (wait)
I used to be a broke lil nigga
Couldn't wait ‘til I got a lil bigger (oh)
I used to be a low head nigga
I was on my ye shit nigga (hey)
Now we in day shifts, nigga, spend bands on the waitress, nigga (you dig?)
I know they probably hate this nig’, ‘cause yo' bitch wanna date this nigga (yeah, yeah)
I just been shopping for cribs
‘Cause they found out where I live (yeah,yeah)
Me and Distortedd, we good
We just went half on a kid (yeah, yeah)
Come to the family I rep
Boy I ain’t missin’ a step (skrt-skrt)
I just booled out on the weed
Doctor say that’s what I need (yeah)
I don’t got room in my closet
I’m ‘bout to make a deposit (yeah)
I take a flight outta Hobby
I’m ‘bout to land in a rita (yeah, yeah)
I’m bout to stay in Shibuya
I’m ‘bout to do the two seater (yeah, yeah)
I wasn't good in school
I was a terrible reader (yeah, yeah)
Then momma didn’t have it this month
I catch you slippin’ at lunch (yeah, yeah)
Me and my bro in the school
You niggas never was cool
Now I’m in the boss at the label
Make sure my young niggas stable
When I say true y’all say world
