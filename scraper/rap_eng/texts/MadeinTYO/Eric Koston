[Intro - MadeinTYO, (K. Swisha)]
(K. Swisha)
Ooh!
K Backwood
Wasn’t hot
Yeah!

[Chorus - MadeinTYO]
Remember when you wasn’t hot?
Now I pull up and get that platinum topped
Brand new, yeah I pull up at the loft
Now I pull up and turn up the spot
Is it true what they say?
Eric Koston, do them diamonds really skate?
Turkey bag, smoking gas in your face
Eric Koston, do them diamonds really skate?

[Verse 1 - MadeinTYO]
I just smoked a whole onion
Diamonds dance like homecoming
I had tried out all the women
I got bread like Russell Simmons
Yeah, that new chain hurt your eyes
Gucci got you mesmerized
Hurt them like them other guys
Tokyo you hella fly
Never ever mad at you
Yellow girl wit attitude
Yeah, that new chain hurt your eyes
Gucci got you mesmerized

[Chorus - MadeinTYO]
Remember when you wasn’t hot?
Now I pull up and get that platinum topped
Brand new, yeah I pull up at the loft
Now I pull up and turn up the spot
Is it true what they say?
Eric Koston, do them diamonds really skate?
Turkey bag, smoking gas in your face
Eric Koston, do them diamonds really skate?

[Verse 2 - MadeinTYO]
Passing weed front row
All my dawgs on gold
All colour Pow-chains
Always smoking loud man
Okay, you can have this flow
Don’t be mad, yeah yeah
I just hit the chronic, bro
My bitch bad, hell yeah
Tokyo (?)
I still do the Jordan ones
Five bands at Round 2
Keep that pack around you
I smoke pack with Noah too
(?)
I don’t fuck wit people
Don’t fuck wit my people

[Chorus - MadeinTYO]
Remember when you wasn’t hot?
Now I pull up and get that platinum topped
Brand new, yeah I pull up at the loft
Now I pull up and turn up the spot
Is it true what they say?
Eric Koston, do them diamonds really skate?
Turkey bag, smoking gas in your face
Eric Koston, do them diamonds really skate?
