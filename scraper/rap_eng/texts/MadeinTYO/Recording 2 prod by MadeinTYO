Verse 1:

Alright

Way she give me head I call her Ms. Tupae
Fish fillet on my paper plate
Got her wet on a rainy day
She wanna skate told her wait I already got a Icey ring
I was late to the date but I brought the K
And today I worked out my arms and chest
Then I hit the parlor
Tatted on my arms and chest
Cash a check
Then what’s next
A armed force
Form the north where’s there’s hittas on every corner
Every morning up early like Tom Joyner
And my pockets chase racks like Tom and Jerry
On the pier where I made her sing like a canary
And it’s clear by her face she can sponsor a dairy
Big body strong nigga you can call me Larry
Way I’m making all these bonds you can me Barry
And these niggas real sweet like a strawberry nigga





Verse 2:

These pussy niggas actin up I call them Tyler Perry
See my diamond earrings
Shining vary leave em wary
Vision scary
Like a VR on ya face at a cemetery
Tell em kiss my dari
Pop her cherry
Then she pop a xan
Tell her to invite a friend
And another friend
Gotta get one right for my mans
Then I serve to her mans
Leave em Dan that’s dirty
Drinking that Kirby
Pull up swervin so it’s lookin like a derbg
Blowin up without a turbin
Snake niggas lurkin so I gotta keep the grass cut even if it’s short imma keep going
Money still growin
Polo draws showin in this bitch
Niggas like the light cause they switch
Don’t callem Franks callem Stich
Might runaway with ya bitch
Im neva comin back
