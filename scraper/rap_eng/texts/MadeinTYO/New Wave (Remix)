[Hook: Rich The Kid & Famous Dex]
They tryna copy the wave
Too many chains like a slave
Rich Forever getting paid
Money machine might break
Whoa wait

Watch how I jump in the crowd
Reach for my chain, boy how
30 on me, swear to God, I'll bring ya down

Broke rappers in they feelings, they hate
Real diamonds on me, biting them straight
All these rappers turning fu

He got signed, but that nigga got dropped
Audemar, that's a house on my watch
