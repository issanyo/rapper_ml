[Intro: Salma Slims & MadeinTYO]
Oh Chevi Music hey
(I love the private club, members only)
Yeah, Salma
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: Salma Slims]
These conversations ain't for me, see they bout so much drama
Why his girlfriend callin' bout his old girl problems?
Don't they know that I ain't here to be fazed
I just wanna take this dude on a date, yeah
I dreamed about the big things
I thought about the fancy cars
I just got a bigger ring
Like I won the Superbowl
I'm doin' bigger better shit
I'm makin' bigger better plays
I ain't worried about a tip
Like I run the NBA

[Hook: Salma Slims]
Salma run the sauna
Extra garlic, Benihana
Conversation ain't bout drama
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
Salma run the sauna
Extra garlic, Benihana
Conversation ain't bout drama
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas

[Verse 2: Noah Wood$]
Waste my time, I'll get the line out the llama out the Sprinter van
I need me some commas, give a fuck about the glitz and glam
Shouts out to my Twitter fans
Show you how I been the man
No I do not give a damn
Benihana dinner plan
Sushi with the rice before the flight, I take your bitch out
Hear 'em talkin' shit cause they can't handle what they miss out
Doin' me, I'm livin' good and you at home and watchin'
If it ain't about the commas why the fuck you even talkin'

[Hook: Salma Slims]
Salma run the sauna
Extra garlic, Benihana
Conversation ain't bout drama
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
Salma run the sauna
Extra garlic, Benihana
Conversation ain't bout drama
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas

[Verse 3: MyNamesPhin]
Slicker than your bitch weed
Watchin' porn in the big screen
She count cash and bag it
I double count it then stash it
Start actin' just like the actress
And backflips on my mattress
It's magic the way she wobble
Got me thumbin' through commas
I was on the way to money play
She hit my line and said pull up
I done smoked 100 J's
I'm out of line, she got me stuck
To go plays from Benihana's
Spillin' rice inside her Honda
On my way to get the money
Fuck you thought? We dumb and dumber?

[Hook: Salma Slims]
Salma run the sauna
Extra garlic, Benihana
Conversation ain't bout drama
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
Salma run the sauna
Extra garlic, Benihana
Conversation ain't bout drama
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
Only talkin' if it's commas
