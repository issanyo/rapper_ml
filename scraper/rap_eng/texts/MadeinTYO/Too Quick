[Intro]
I love The Private Club
Nard & B

[Hook]
Had to get a brand new bitch
‘Cause I get bored too quick
Had to get a brand new ice
‘Cause I get bored too quick
Cut her off, upgrade
Got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade
Just flood my wrist
I get bored too quick
I get bored too quick
I get bored too quick
I get bored too quick
Cut her off, upgrade
Got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade
Just flood my wrist

[Verse 1]
Chop the top, never stop
I get bored too quick
Silly thot, want my spot
I get bored too quick
Louis V, watch ‘em hang, I could see your bitch
She be choosing on the low
I can’t save that bitch
Yeezy hanging out the window
I’ve got lots of handles
Shout out to Gwen and Wesley Foo, that my kinfolk
Been tweaking lately
All my shit gotta be exotic
Baby blue Porsche that shit look like Hpnotiq

[Hook]
Had to get a brand new bitch
‘Cause I get bored too quick
Had to get a brand new ice
‘Cause I get bored too quick
Cut her off, upgrade
Got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade
Just flood my wrist
I get bored too quick
I get bored too quick
I get bored too quick
I get bored too quick
Cut her off, upgrade
Got bored too quick
Lifeguard lemonade
Just flood my wrist

[Verse 2]
Gucci duffel, bust yo' bubble ugh you ain't hot
Saint Laurent winter jacket, had it 'fore it drop
Told Distorted if she want it, cop that BM drop
Kinjin ice me up
Meechie pipe me up
Mr. Ice cream truck
Can you ice me up?
Shawty just show love
Tokyo give no fuck
She let the YSL hang
I told her tootle that thang
TPC, that my gang
She wanna kiss the chain
