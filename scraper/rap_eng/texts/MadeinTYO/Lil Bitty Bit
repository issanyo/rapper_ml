Ayo, what the fuck, what's up motherfuckers?
It's Travis Scott, A.KA La Flame, bitch
Shout out my nigga, A$AP Ant, my nigga DJ Nick
Marino gang motherfuckin' takin' this shit over, nigga
[?] on these bitch niggas

[Verse 1]
Hold on lil' bitty bitch
Look at my diamonds, that shit lookin’ sick
Look at my diamonds they look very frigid
They ice cold like they straight out the fridges
I’m in the back and yo' bitch, she is screamin'
I’m in the back and the dick in her spleen
I don’t give a fuck
Nigga I’m winning, I’m winning
These hoes callin' me Charlie Sheen
But the lil’ bitty bitch don’t really want problems
No mathematics, I solve them
Snuck in the bitch and I got the revolver
It’s best if you don’t get involved
I’m fucking this bitch and I’m tearing her walls up
The bitch wanna fuck me I’m ballin'
Bitch wanna fuck me I’m ballin'
She ball Kaepernick and I’m callin, I’m callin'
Bitch I know you wan’ suck dick
So come here I put it dead in your mouth and your jaws
If that’s your partner you better not cross
All of these bitches just wan’ feel important
Canary yellow diamonds they get imported
I move discreet movin' packs across the world
Back to back fucking these bitches
They said won't block you but you mad annoying
Bitch

[Hook]
Lil' bitty bitch
Lil' bitty bitch

She see me up in the lights
Thinking I’m gon’ change her life
Bitch, you better think twice
Bitch, you better act right
Lil' bitty bitch, I do not trust you
Lil' bitty bitch, I will not love you
Lil' bitty bitch, only got love for you
Lil' bitty bitch
They see me up in the lights
These niggas they see me they swipe
Seen these fuck boys these niggas on sight
They see my swag and they bite

[Verse 2]
Imma come in [?] bring a bitch
Chopper hit ‘em and you know I let it rip
Sippin’ lean and you know I cop a script
I wanna fuck that hoe
So I told that hoe to come here
I can’t even speak to other woadies in my ear
Fuck a double cup cause I sip it straight out the seal
Fuck her, disappear
Waiting on my broadie he waiting for her to appear
I can’t even love her I told you ‘cause she a squeal
Tryna boot up
Nigga try us and that work that you do
