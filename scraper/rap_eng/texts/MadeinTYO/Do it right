Feat. Royce Rizzy

Top bottom floor and I love my life
Top bottom floor and she loves this life
Your bitch fell in love, she wanna spend the night
Probably called the squad, said boy this ain't no hive
I go for the check-up if I do it right
I go for the check-up if I do it right
I go for the check-up if I do it right
I go for the check-up if I do it right

If I call her babe, you know she fine
Fly her to the ??? yeah she lost her mind
If you don't have money then I waste my time
Tell her from afar, man I love my life
Bitch don't try to cuff me, I ain't looking for a wife
If I cuff the ones, then I'll them for always
Riverdale shawty give me top, yeah twice
??? I hit that thing twice
I'm out in Tokyo, I mix the sushi with the rice
Pulling up the ??? I hit the fucking right
I go for the check-up if I do it fucking right
I go for the check-up if I do it fucking right
Top bottom floor and she loves this life
Your bitch fell in love, she wanna spend the night
Probably called the squad, said boy this ain't no hive
I go for the check-up if I do it right
I go for the check-up if I do it right
I go for the check-up if I do it right
I go for the check-up if I do it right
