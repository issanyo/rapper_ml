[Intro: Marty Baller]
Yeah
Check it

[Hook: Marty Baller]
I'ma do my thing
Watch me do my thing
'Bout to hop in the range
Disappear I'm David Blaine
I'ma do my thing
Watch me do my thing
'Bout to cop me some James
We ain't rockin' Balmains

[Verse 1: Marty Baller]
I be goin' doin' my thing
Ballin' on, I'm the man
Got me screaming "I'm the man"
Put me in the Hall of Fame
I just hopped out the plane
Screamin' ball out, gang gang
I just took a trip to Spain
All these bitches look the same
I don't remember your name
I was sippin' champagne
I was sippin' on the lane
You're tryna be gang
You was tryna get a ride
Fuck a bitch, get the side
Fuck a bitch, roll up
Drink till' you throw up
I do what I want to
I flex what I want to
Have sex when I want to
Get fresh when I want to
No bitch, I do not want to
I do not want you
(?) don't want two
(?)

[Hook: Marty Baller & MadeinTYO]
I'ma do my thing
Watch me do my thing (skrt)
'Bout to hop in the range
Disappear I'm David Blaine  (yeah)
I'ma do my thing (uuh)
Watch me do my thing (uuh)
'Bout to cop me some James (skrt)
We ain't rockin' Balmains

[Verse 2: MadeinTYO]
Yeah
Rockin' Alexander Wang
Takin' off like a plane
You was tryna be gang
I was stayin' in my lane (skrt skrt)
All of girls' pussy amazing
Shawty, can I get the top?
Goin' in like a mob
Hannibal racks on my neck
Honey racks, nigga bet
What's the play, what's next?
I was tryna get the check
I was tryna get the check
Look at me in a Vet
Sippin' lean, get in that
Goin' platinum where ya at
Shawty had a real fat

[Pre-Hook: MadeinTYO]
Yeah, ooh
I do what I want to (ooh)
I flex what I want to (ooh)
I flex when I wa-, I flex when I -
Do what I want to
I do what I want to
I do what I want to
I flex when I, I flex when I

[Hook: Marty Baller]
