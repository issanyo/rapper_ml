[Chorus: MadeinTYO]
I got dome from a hottie
Needles on my body
Always in Atlanta and we kick it like karate
My bitch bad you're worse
I'm 'bout action first
Why you cat been brought
Two bitch actin' up
I got dome from a hottie
Needles on my body
Always in Atlanta and we kick it like karate
My bitch bad you're worse
I'm 'bout action first
Why you cat been brought
Two bitch actin' up

[Verse: MadeinTYO]
Cruisin' on a bike tryna find the right speed
She say she super thirsty and she wanna slurp me
White Tee, SB, and some skinny ass jeans
It really don't make sense pussy at me
Cause that boy up now I'm searchin' for a bust down
Got a flow it's clutch now
Take a seat sit down
Kicks on compound
I could take yo style
Yellow bone mouth wild
Nigga wassup now
Please just release the flow
More slice than a pizza hoe
[?] no G.I. Joe
Bad bitch eat a hoe
Tryna rap to meet a hoe
This that women eater flow
If she clean I eat her tho
Why she look like pita dough
Three times super flow
Dyin' in that pussy tho
Shakin' like the holy ghost
Never try to do the most
Put me in the super ghost
Fuckin' wit a super G.O.A.T
Wonder why they hate the most

[Chorus: MadeinTYO]
I got dome from a hottie
Needles on my body
Always in Atlanta and we kick it like karate
My bitch bad you're worse
I'm 'bout action first
Why you cat been brought
Two bitch actin' up
I got dome from a hottie
Needles on my body
Always in Atlanta and we kick it like karate
My bitch bad you're worse
I'm 'bout action first
Why you cat been brought
Two bitch actin' up
