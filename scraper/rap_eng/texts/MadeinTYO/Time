[Verse 1: MadeinTYO]
Drink Screw, two screw loose
Tatted too, padded room
Hair matted too, Rasta in the booth
Screamin' fuck a school
Dropout, druggie too
Skinny jeans, skully too
And my cup muddy too
Styrofoam cups, pour me up, hold me down
Anywhere that I step on the Earth, bless the ground
All this motherfuckin' water on the kid, fuckin' drown
Need a lifeguard, fuck a nigga wife, you need a wife guard
808 the Tribe like I'm Phife Dawg
I'm the shit, ass wipe
Nigga you get wiped off, lights off
Lights on, pop a Perc cause the flight long
Fuck that bitch all night long, buy lingerie in nylon
You the type to claim a bitch who isn't yours
And she the type who always got her knees on floors
Backwoods like cigars, I need a torch
She slob on my knob like a door

[Hook: MadeinTYO]
Tell me what it is, yeah, tell me what time it is
Tell me what time it is, tell me what time it is
Tell me what time it is, tell me what time it is
Tell me what time it is, tell me what time it is

[Verse 2: Chris Fresh]

Got them threes with a Y
Boy I'm on that Y-3 distorted right beside me
Foreign jawn she ride me, foreign jawn she ride me
All of these bitches want time, I don't be be payin' no mind
All of these bitches want time, I don't be be payin' no mind
Smokin' that gas and she fine, smokin' that gas and she fine, yeah
Smokin' that gas and she fine, smokin' that gas and she fine, yeah

[Hook: MadeinTYO]
Tell me what it is, yeah, tell me what time it is
