[Intro]
(K Swisha)
K backwood, fuck you mean?
Yo, smoke real good, feel real good
We can't get out wood

[Verse 1]
Ben & Jerry big round two
I could go rounds too
Watch who you put 'round you
Smoke a quarter pound ooh
Niggas want my sounds too
Heard them niggas used to fuck around and clown you
But not no more
Want to drop a couple bands at the Gucci store
We them lame niggas baby, yeah you too beautiful
Yeah I be at the bank, smell like stank, just the usual
I be at the bank, smell like stank, just the usual

[Hook]
This ain't somethin' that you used to
Break your heart shawty, boo-hoo, oh
You love me, oh, oh
You love me, oh, oh
You love me, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
I want Chanel
Stuck in the mail
Damn oh-oh-oh, told 'em myself
I can't lie shawty need some help
Ay, racks on my belt
Shawty too fine, she making me melt, woah
Nike like I'm balling on the court
Why you looking like you know you can't afford?
K Backwood, yup I think they want some more
They hated on me now a nigga on tour
I'm smoking real gas, yeah the half on a pack
Shawty cute and she small but that ass still fat
I've been doin' my thing, put a nigga on the map
I've been doin' my thing, put a nigga on the map

[Outro]
K Backwood, hey
Copped two chains and that shit's too bright
She's so fine and her ass so bright
I wonder why they really wanna be like us
Wonder why they really wanna be like us
Copped two chains and them shit's too bright
She's so fine and that ass so bright
I wonder why they really wanna be like us
Wonder why they really wanna be like us
