{Verse}

Lil cool young nigga, fresh gas in my swisher
Nish, she got the dirty, babe got wraps and the scissors
Moscato in my cup I think I’ll pass on the liquor
Ya b***h be on my gram that's why I’m tagged in her pictures
I don’t know...
What these hoes want from me, I’m just a boy
Wit a whole lotta swagger and them bills like McCoy
Off-Brand, they my homies. If you not them, you don’t know me. Hoes f**k wit me OD
Tweetin' kissy face emojis but...
I do not f**k wit these hoes
I don’t know what you been told
I be that young n**a drippin' in gold
From my head to my toes
And b***h I don’t take losses
You better at those
You don’t put fear in the heart of me
You don’t put chills in my arteries
Lord God The Father my armory
7 my archery
Hit you then spark up the parsley
Pardon me
I’m kinda lost, you see
Louie that n***a so watch how you talk to me
I’m not the killer but I can assist ya
On gettin' you dunked by my Barkley, Charles
Had someone tell me I wouldn’t go far
Now that bitch husband is parkin' my car
B****es ain’t sh** and they know who they are
They will love you today and forget you tomar
And I’m only gon answer my one or two calls:
Money or family and trust me that's all
Everybody be sayin' they rawwww
F**k outta here, you was talkin' to law
These n****z hate me, I know it
Watch em cause them n****z is savages
I do not know them
They not in my circle so f**k em
I only trust Harrison
Ain’t no comparison
I’m the full packaging
Rappers don’t want it they know I’ll embarrass em
From Philly to Maryland
They know what’s happening
Uber everywhere. Backwoods for the zip
Yeah
Roll me up a plane cause I wanna take a trip
Uber every f**kin' where
N***a you know how it get
I don’t need two dimes, my girl a 20 by herself
And I’m always wit my team but I never need no help
You must got it fucked up
See, I’m quiet, I ain’t sweet
Have a nigga roughed up
Pay respect and I ain’t cheap. Aye

[Scur Scur]

{Chorus}

Uber everywhere
Backwoods for the zip. Yeah
Roll me up a plane cause I wanna take a trip
Uber every f**kin' where
N***a you know how it get
