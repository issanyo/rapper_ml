[Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
I said (what)
The uzi gon' slip through your hand like you gripping on soap
I said (what)
I did not have a new feeling while fucking that ho (ya dig)
I said
Look at the uzi, the uzi wetter than a boat
She said
Jacuzzi, jacuzzi, the water feel good on her toes
Live a little, smoke a little, sip a little (drank)
Drip a little, you a rat just like Stuart Little (ay)
I said
I don't think Uno, lil' Uno can trust you no more
I said (what)
[?] drip a little (drip)

[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
Need green just like chlorophyll (green)
Ice on my neck check the wind chill (ice)
Going very fast got flies on the windshield, yeah
And it's
Only gelato in the air here
No pill but the boys know this Benadryl
All these hoes want the same thing like a synonym, damn
And it's
Chain, rings, McQueen, Celine
'Chu mean, she want it
It's a dream, keep 'em going (ya dig)
She twerking, my wrist in the pot and I work (ya dig)
Swerving, excursion, it's hurting
Think she allergic to all these broke niggas

[Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
I said
The uzi gon' slip through your hand like you gripping on soap
I said (what)
I did not have a new feeling while fucking that ho (nope)
I said
Look at the uzi, the uzi wetter than a boat
She said
Jacuzzi, jacuzzi, the water feel good on her toes
Live a little, smoke a little, sip a little (oh)
Drip a little, you a rat just like Stuart Little (quiet)
I said
I don't think Uno, lil' Uno can trust you no more
I said
[?] drip a little

[Verse 2: MadeinTYO]
Chanel
I got a lot but not going to jail
Cracking ya Taco Bell
My shorty gorgeous, I'm doing it well
I got some [?]
Killing these niggas, I'm wishing 'em well
My shorty Spanish, no J Lo
Giving me head like a halo
I could put you on a payroll
Lay you out on a table
Never, now I'm private club label
Leave a lil' bih disabled
Rick Ross feeling like a big boss
Diamonds on neck shine like my bih lip gloss
Never been a, dog
Diamonds on me like, uhh

[Chorus: UnoTheActivist]
I said
The uzi gon' slip through your hand like you gripping on soap
I said
I did not have a new feeling while fucking that ho
I said
Look at the uzi, the uzi wetter than a boat
She said
Jacuzzi, jacuzzi, the water feel good on her toes
Live a little, smoke a little, sip a little
Drip a little, you a rat just like Stuart Little
I said
I don't think Uno, lil' Uno can trust you no more
I said
