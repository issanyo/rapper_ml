Hey, skrrt skrrt

[Hook: Swae Lee]
Fuck it man, I'm bout to call up a party bus
Bitch I wanna see you crawl on the party bus
Ain't no seat belts on the party bus
Fuck the Uber I'mma call up a party bus
Yeah you know, we bout a call up a party bus
Bitch I wanna see you crawl on the party bus
Ain't no seat belts on the party bus
Fuck the Uber I'mma call up a party bus

[Verse 1]
30 deep, they ain't fuckin' with none of us
Fuck the Uber, I'mma call up the party bus
South side shawty, yeah, you know you're one of us
You say you got a table, why you don't run it up?
Fourty guns, twenty bitches goin' crazy
Hit it from the back I ain't never been lazy
Private club records, I can really take your lady
Private club records, I can really take your lady
Murda, I promise I'mma get 'em
Fendi specs with the YSL denim
Brazy and honest cause the hoes roll with him
We don't want the party bus unless the poles in 'em
I can really tell that she into me
Guess who's gettin' drunk off the Hennessy?
Private club what ya'll pretend to be
Bugatti shades in the club, now I can't see

[Verse 2]
Why you lookin' like you won't throw that
I'm in Canada, Murda where the hoes at?
Wake up in the mornin', where my fuckin' clothes at?
Miami for the week (?) fuckin' back
Bitch I'm booted up in the worst way
Shawty got cake like her birthday
I won't ever, ever come in last place
Guess who made it shake like an earthquake?
Two bitches (?) drinkin' on a table
Bet they pass it off like a hot potato
Feel like P. Diddy, bitch I need a J-Lo
Big franks feel like fuckin' fable
I'm in Atlanta, yeah with the roof gone
I ain't fucked that bitch in two weeks, that's too long
Baby let me grab the fuckin' ass first
Lil sneaky bitch, swear she want my password
