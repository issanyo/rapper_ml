[Instrumental]

[Hook x2]
Baby Boss
Rick Ross
Going up, gravy sauce
Gimmie the top with the lip gloss
Nasty bih, yeah I'm takin off
Baby Boss
Baby Boss
Baby Boss, ooh
Baby Boss
Baby Boss
Baby Boss, ooh

[Verse]
Break your neck when you find her
Oh I'm just missing Lil Anya
Appetite like a monster
I can't ride in a Honda
Niggas cappin last summer
Drop the album this summer
Back in getting dumber
Back in getting dumber
Pussy nigga tryna kick it
Hold it down when you get it
Suck me up she exquisite
Money stacks like a midget
Slow down when I'm in it
Made in Lieutenant
Macaroni when I'm in it
Slow ground when I'm in it
I got it comma for comma
She got them thighs from her mama
Heat on like a sauna
Thin knots she a runner
Pimp poppin' for the number
Green diamond cucumber
Do it for a damn stack
J Mac bring it back

[Hook x2]
Baby Boss
Rick Ross
Going up, gravy sauce
Gimmie the top with the lip gloss
Nasty bih, yeah I'm takin off
Baby Boss
Baby Boss
Baby Boss, ooh
Baby Boss
Baby Boss
Baby Boss, ooh
