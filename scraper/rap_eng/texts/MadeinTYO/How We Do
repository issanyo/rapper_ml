[Chorus: Smooky MarGielaa]
Brand new Masi, I bought two
Brand new Rari, it go vroom, yeah, that's just how we do, ah
Money on my mind, it's stuck like glue, yeah
Diamonds got the flu, yeah, too much juice, yeah
Ah, yeah, do it then I pass it to the crew, yeah
Margielas on me, ooh yeah, brand new jewels, yeah
Ah, yeah, diamonds around my neck wet like a pool, yeah
Stop on food, yeah, not on smoke, yeah

[Verse 1: Smooky MarGielaa]
Ah yeah, hop up in that brand new Bentley coupe
Watch me skrrt off with your boo
Yeah she with a different dude
Pull up in that double-R too
It's MarGielaa and the crew
Young nigga rich, ooh
Yeah, ah, yeah, boy you know I got the juice
Yeah, brought a hundred bands to my motherfucking school, yeah
Ooh, yeah, bust down iced out chains for the crew, yeah
Pent a couple blues on my brand new icy jewels, yeah
Ooh, yeah, boy I run 'round with a black card
Always eating five star, yeah, new Jaguar
Ooh, yeah, I'm off to the top, to the stars
Diamonds shine from far, this one to the charts

[Chorus: Smooky MarGielaa]
Brand new Masi, I bought two
Brand new Rari, it go vroom, yeah, that's just how we do, ah
Money on my mind, it's stuck like glue, yeah
Diamonds got the flu, yeah, too much juice, yeah
Ah, yeah, do it then I pass it to the crew, yeah
Margielas on me, ooh yeah, brand new jewels, yeah
Ah, yeah, diamonds around my neck wet like a pool, yeah
Stop on food, yeah, not on smoke, yeah

[Verse 2: MadeinTYO]
Yeah, taking it out like a pelican
Niggas be hating, I'm better than
Running it up like a running man
I spent that shit like a Sonic man
I get that power like Megaman
Margiela wave man, flexing on the pavement
Oh yeah we waiting, sorry had a moment
Baby where you going, tell me if you want it
Tell me if you want it, you so fine in Louis
Racks up, share my doobie
Link up, make a movie
Get it up top, a foolie
Used to run them baddies every day

Wake up, give me top every day (skrrt)
She told me that my lifestyle cray

[Chorus: Smooky MarGielaa]
Brand new Masi, I bought two
