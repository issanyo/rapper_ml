[Verse 1: CRAIG]
Throw a three up like im Jerry West
Mr. Outside jumper boy make it swish
Southside production like im from Atlanta
Got blood on my hands Tarantino my fists
Xanax in my wallet my friends hitting licks
Fightin the case till they drop my charges
S/o Matt Walker he fuck up the feds
Still riding hot boy I drive an oven
Zeke from the creek boy I dont miss a three
If she catch me cheating then ima go ghost
Need to do laundry there's nut on my sheets
Set a screen to the paint then I crash in the post
I dont do blow but the white girls love it
Came in the game white boy dress like mclovin
All my plugs asian all my shit imported
Cali pack no tolerance her nose runnin
Feds go and pull us think we up to something
Be wary where you are in the middle of the night
I lost my car, bitch, and bread in colleton
Had to get right, little bitch here I am
Throw a three like I'm Zeke, fuck the feds like I'm Matt
Barely droppin punch lines, Craig really stating facts
Hoes saying vows at my age I don't want none of that
Stack of paper can't fold it just be down to count racks
Zeke past the line in the paint I go Shaq
Commitin crime yea my life moving fast
Bring the beat back man this shit move too slow
Pull up a jumper Jerry West on your hoe

[Chorus 1: CRAIG]
Throw a three up like im jerry west
Mr.outside jumper boy make it swish
Southside production like im from atlanta
Got blood on my hands tarantino my fists
Zeke from the creek boy I dont miss a three
If she catch me cheating then ima go ghost
Need to do laundry there's nut on my sheets
Set a screen to the paint then I crash in the post

[Verse 2: CRAIG]
In my freetime all I do is play 2k
So I can get good and wax all of yall ass
Fuck my parents who wanna be my roomate
Lets move to the west la no lookin back
If we need money we start cookin crank
Craig in The bay flippin like a damn crane
Makin my music runnin up my plays
Making my money never changing my ways
I was in highschool was working 2 jobs
And flipping QP's right out of my backyard
Then we got locked up for a half a pound
Thank god every day that my charges got dropped
From cabin creek boy I don't miss a shot
Mermaid shit icy my waterproof watch

[Chorus 2: CRAIG]
Zeke from the creek boy I dont miss a three
If she catch me cheating then ima go ghost
Need to do laundry there's nut on my sheets
Set a screen to the paint then I crash in the post
Throw a three up like im Jerry West
Mr. Outside jumper boy make it swish
Southside production like im from Atlanta
Got blood on my hands Tarantino my fists
