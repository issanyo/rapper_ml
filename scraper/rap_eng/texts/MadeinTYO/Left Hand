[Hook: Key!]
A bottle of Ace, now I'm feelin' like Kobe
I'm shootin' with my left hand, Ginobili
You think you might know but, you don't know me
I remember everythin', this is over
I make a little money and I stunt it with the gang
I put a nigga on 'fore I buy me a chain
These niggas takin' shots, they ain't even got range
I want it, I cop it, I want it, I cop it
I'm playin' with bands, I'm playin' with bands
I'm playin' with bands, I'm playin' with bands
I'm playin' with bands, I'm playin' with bands
I'm playin' with bands, I'm playin' with bands

[Verse 1: UnoTheActivist]
I'm playin' with bands, I'm playin' with bands
I get so, I get so high, I don't think I can land
I'm all in the zone, I feel like the man
When did I kick in my shit, I'm in a karate stance
I'm pullin' up, crack it, then I go buy it
All of my niggas all love this shit like a video game
And I just bought my shooter a chain
I cannot stop 'cause they gonna watch and I am the man
And they all say I'm the man, I'm with the lean with the Xan
What you say now? I got plans, baby should give me a chance
I told her I wish I had words, you should do shit for the worse
Told her I think that I'm cursed, then I go and pop a Perc

[Verse 2: MadeinTYO]
She rockin' the ice, lovin' her life
Pipe you up quick, switchin' my fish
Make it up quick, thick as a bitch
Make it up quick, thick as a bitch
Yeah, love with a bag, makin' her mad
Poppin' up tags, rackin' 'em up
Invitin' her friends, your nigga's a fan
Hop in the Benz, touch down when I land
Yokohama with a Gucci, Pocahontas, she'll do me
You don't wanna make a movie, she don't wanna make a movie
Margiela's, no umbrella, splash on these hoes
Get so used to smash on these hoes
