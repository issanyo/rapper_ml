(I Love The Private Club)

(Intro)
Oh yea, yea
Oh yea, yea
Why these nigas always fake?
Why these niggas in my face?
Bitches always on the way
I need a piece of the cake
I will never take a break
Where the toast, if she be cookin?
Want to see me do the booking
Bitch I'm up, handsome
And I'm good lookin'

Swinging on the ceiling

Why do niggas always act fake?
Why these bitches always in my face?
