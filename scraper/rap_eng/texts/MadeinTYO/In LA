Me and Brady in the hills wit it (yah)
Shawty know the deal wit (shawty know the deal)
Gucci on the heels wit it
The money got us goin' crazy
I never let that life change me
Everywhere I go I get pictures taken of me
Imma give her what she want whenever she need
Everything feels right. yah
She'll be back tonight, yah
But she can't spend the night, yah
I gotta catch a flight, yah
You know there ain't no stoppin'
Ima keep on droppin'
Anything I want I cop it

Badie out in LA (i'm on herb)
Badie out in LA (i'm on herb)
Park that car in valet (oh, oh, oh, oh)
And you know the diamonds skate (sauce)
No they cannot flame me
Wonder why they hatin' me, cause my diamonds wavy
Got a bad baby (oh)
Pull up in Mercedes, yeah i'm goin' crazy
