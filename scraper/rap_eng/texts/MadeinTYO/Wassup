Blow too slow when ya leaning it (ooh)

In a strip club throwing couple thousand bands (racks, racks)

[Verse 2: S'natra]
(Here I go)
I will not pick up my telephone
Leave a message ho, be professional
Get back to you when I want (when I want)
Now back to the game I was brought up in
No one watching the doors that let all y'all in
I'm putting my feet up, your raps is the ottoman
Came in to get me some [?] and now I'm just
[?], swerving off the juice (skrrr)
Gave your girl the D and fuck 12, R.I.P. the proof (fuck 12)
I just want M after M, don't mind if I do (want M's)
All I really want to do is win, nigga I never had time to lose (yeah)

[Chorus: MadeinTYO & S'natra]
Wassup wassup wassup, bitch

Wassup wassup wassup, bitch
Wassup wassup wassup, bitch
Pull up, smoke up
Fucked up, shit
Hold up, I'm slowed up
You know what is lit
Pull up, smoke up
Fucked up, shit
Hold up, I'm slowed up
You know what is lit
