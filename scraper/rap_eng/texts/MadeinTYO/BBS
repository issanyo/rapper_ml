[Intro Sample: Agnes Obel]
Can you walk on the water if I, you and I?
Because your blood’s running cold outside the familiar true to life
Can you walk on the water if I, you and I?
Or keep your eyes on the road and live in the familiar without you and I

[Verse: MadeinTYO]
Big boy stuntin'
Prada on my woman
Gucci store run it
If they got it I don't want it
Pull it back like an orange
I just need the foreign
This that Ralph with the Lauren
Why you looking boring
[?] socks, drip on lock
Hat all summer, bitch I'm growing dread locks
Flintstones on my chain, no Bedrock
She give good top, she a head doc
Crush a bit, lil bit, roll it up, take a hit yuh
Passed on that bitch cause my nigga hit yuh
You a lame nigga, you on sucker shit yuh
Crush a bit, lil bit, roll it up, take a hit yuh

[Outro Sample: Agnes Obel]
And our love is a ghost that the others can't see
It's a danger
Every shade of us you fade down to keep
Them in the dark on who we are
(Oh what you do to me)
Gonna be the death of me
It's a danger
Cause our love is a ghost that the others can't see
