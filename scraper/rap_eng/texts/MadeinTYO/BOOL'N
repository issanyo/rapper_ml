[Hook]
Boolin' with your bitch she never told you
Wanna bag a gas in the old school
Tryna steal the sauce, boy I taught you
Shooting fades for the low, boy I off you
Boolin' with your bitch she never told you
Wanna bag a gas in the old school
Tryna steal the sauce, boy I taught you
Shooting fades for the low, boy I off you

[Verse 1]
Miami in the morning with a bad bitch
Got a Mishka Gucci Preme habit
All real timings, king salad
Nudies the 1s, boy Iâ€™m a classic
Balling, yep I'm surfing, I'm too wavy
Going hard on them hoes that tried to play me
Made a couple songs got them going brazy

[Refrain]
Hey, hey what you doing

[Hook]
Boolin' with your bitch she never told you
Wanna bag a gas in the old school
Tryna steal the sauce, boy I taught you
Shooting fades for the low, boy I off you
Boolin' with your bitch she never told you
Wanna bag a gas in the old school
Tryna steal the sauce, boy I taught you
Shooting fades for the low, boy I off you

[Verse 2]
Could've been on the team, lil shawty a fiend
Lil wrist in them jeans, Alexander McQueen
Stepping out on the scene
Want it all but I need more
Yellow diamonds, juggin' out the speed boat

[Hook]
Boolin' with your bitch she never told you
Wanna bag a gas in the old school
Tryna steal the sauce, boy I taught you
Shooting fades for the low, boy I off you
Boolin' with your bitch she never told you
Wanna bag a gas in the old school
Tryna steal the sauce, boy I taught you
Shooting fades for the low, boy I off you

[Refrain]
Hey, hey what you doing

~Beat change~

[Verse 3]
Never take a L
Roll the window down for the smell
She just popped two and she feeling herself
All I know is getting money
All I know is getting paper
All I know is stack up
I be flexing on a hater

[Hook]
Smelling like a hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna dollar bill
Hunna, hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna dollar bill
Hunna, hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna dollar bill
Smelling hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna dollar bill
Smelling hunna dollar bill

[Verse 4]
Piped up bih, how you feel?
Can't fake it, all y'all niggas keep it real
Switch for a guy, young guy no chill
Hold up, swole up I be in the field
Really I need me a rollie
Rolling in LA no Kobe
Liking all of my pics like she know me
Dick her down in the night and she leave in the morning
I'm yawning, hey

[Hook]
Smelling like a hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna, hunna, hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna, hunna, hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna, hunna, hunna dollar bill
Smelling like a hunna, hunna, hunna dollar bill

[Outro]
Sauce, skrr skrr
Sauce, skrr skrr
Hey, lil bitch
Hunna dollar bill
