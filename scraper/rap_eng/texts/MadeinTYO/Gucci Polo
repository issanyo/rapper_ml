Valentino, went and copped them new sneaks
Yeah my baby miss me, I been gone for weeks
Hit that pussy once and put that ass to sleep
She might ride Louis V for the week
Piped up, I heard these niggas too sweet
Your shit don't jam like me, like me
They used to doubt a nigga now they wanna talk
I took her out to Lanna first class shop
800 on the sneaks, I'm too geeked
I've been booked up countin' racks all week
She wanna fuck me every time I'm in town
Makin' Shay lil' shawty hit the ground
They say they love me, I love you too
That bitch average, ain't got nothin' on you
I hate a nigga that be poppin' out the blue
The type that hate on you when you be makin' moves

Copped that Polo messin' with the Gucci now
Got a check then I flew my granny out
Shawty eatin' good, yeah she thick as fuck
I feel like 2Pac when he hit 'em up
Diamonds dancin', I don't do the Gucci much
But copped a house so I don't give a fuck
