Through the dash drop the top let out the scent from the strong
Through the dash drop the top let out the scent from the strong
Through the dash drop the top let out the scent from the strong

2 yellow chicks sneakin' geekin' off the molly they gone
They like Molly how you made it who the fuck put you on
I'm on Fader looking faded and that's just one song
I sit back and I observe and yea they jam to my song

Bad bitch young chick you know I'm coming through
If you real keep it real you know I fuck with you
If you real keep it real you know I fuck with you
