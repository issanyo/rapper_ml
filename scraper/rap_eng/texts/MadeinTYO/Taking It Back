You got a star

Drink in my cup

Pockets are stuffed
Pass me the blunt
Do what I want
Y'all bitches bad, don't push your luck
She with this shit, she booted up
I bought a Louie, she fell in love
She lookin' back, she not a duck
Oh, ay, diamonds on my plate
Two minutes late, oh it's time to skate
No roller blades, 'Sace Venice frames
Heard these niggas lame, oh stay in your lane
