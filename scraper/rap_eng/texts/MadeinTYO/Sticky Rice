Walk in that bitch with some racks

Ride wit that mo'fuckin blasta
I'm just gettin tired of gettin blasted
I let it drip (in real?) fashion
Be so expensive, I'm cashin
They say I'm up next that I'm snappin
Roll a whole ounce and won't pass it
New Glock got a sight
Bitch strapped like a dyke
Pitbull got the bite
Soft nigga get bite

Designer, I'm drippin in that
Louis V sayin don't walk around (campbell?)
Eat on that pussy like hannibal

Gassin that shit like a pedal do that why u don't like I's ahead of you
