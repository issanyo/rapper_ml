Ithinkwegotit man

[Hook]
If you miss me baby text me ay
Roll that weed baby bless me, ay
What you are all the way sexy, ay
Eat that kitty if you ready, ay
If you miss me baby text me, ay (skrrskrr)
Roll that weed up and bless me, ay
What you are all the way sexy, ay (skrrskrr)
Eat that kitty if you ready (ay)

[Chorus 1]
Long nights alone
Baby, I could have starved
Yeah they left me alone
I remember who they are
Remember when you grabbed my hand
I knew I was a man
When I bought them margellias
I knew you couldn't stand
To see me with no other one
I ain't need no other one
Know you are the only one
Yeah you hot like the sun
Baby I got you (skrr skrr)
Cause you my sweet thang (skrr skrr)
Baby I got you (ay)
Yeah you my everything (ay)

[Hook]
If you miss me baby text me ay
Roll that weed baby bless me, ay
What you are all the way sexy, ay
Eat that kitty if you ready, ay
If you miss me baby text me, ay (skrrskrr)
Roll that weed up and bless me, ay
What you are all the way sexy, ay (skrrskrr)
Eat that kitty if you ready (ay)


[Chorus 2]
Maybe life ain't right
Depending who you are (hee)
Recording every night (hee)
A lonely rockstar
Xans hit you hard
Trash inside your car
I don't wanna go nowhere if its far
I don't wanna go nowhere if you ain't there
I just wanna put my fingers in your hair (skrr skrr)

[Hook]
If you miss me baby text me ay
Roll that weed baby bless me, ay
What you are all the way sexy, ay
Eat that kitty if you ready, ay
If you miss me baby text me, ay (skrrskrr)
Roll that weed up and bless me, ay
What you are all the way sexy, ay (skrrskrr)
Eat that kitty if you ready (ay)
