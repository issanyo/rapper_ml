[Verse 1: MadeinTYO]
I told Twenty I'm goin' in
I put a ten on a Gucci lens
I can't fuck with a lot of friends
Ooh, yeah I want the gold Benz
Ready play like a Sega screen
I don't know what a test mean
Put the pussy on a balance beam
Me and K. Swisha, dream team

[Bridge: MadeinTYO]
Shawty you down
Geekin' like pills inside
Shawty you down
Geekin' like pills inside
Shawty you down
Geekin' like pills inside
Shawty you down
Geekin' like pills inside

[Hook: 24hrs]
I just want you
Oh I just want you
Oh I just want you
I just want you rollin' up my blunts
I just want you ridin' in my coupe
I just want you
Oh I just want you
I just want you rollin' up my blunts
I just want you ridin' in my coupe
I just want you
Oh I just want you, yeah

[Verse 2: MadeinTYO]
I don't really try to do much
Ten piece with a fruit punch
Human Made with the old 1s
Strip club, I need the old ones
Ghetto girl with the coupons
When I'm gone, I'ma miss you
Chanel bag, ooh it fits you
Niggas don't want an issue
I was grindin' in the basement
Tryna get me a placement
I put the racks on my neck
Shawty show me respect
I'm in the gym, I'm in the gym
Yeah, chasin' a check
I ain't worried 'bout them hoes
Yeah I got the best

[Hook: 24hrs]
I just want you
Oh I just want you
Oh I just want you
I just want you rollin' up my blunts
I just want you ridin' in my coupe
I just want you
Oh I just want you
I just want you rollin' up my blunts
I just want you ridin' in my coupe
I just want you
Oh I just want you, yeah, yeah, yeah
