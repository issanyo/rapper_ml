Oh my God, Ronny

Please, don't panic (Ooh)

Ooh, whole 'notha planet (Wait)
I'm too high not landing (Rack)
Ooh, damn (Yeah, yeah)
You doin' outstandin' (Skrr-skrr)
Ooh, damn, (Ooh)
You doin' outstandin', hey

[Verse 1]
I spend a stack on the booth
None o' you bitches is cute
I just be rackin' the loot
You niggas gotta reboot
I see you fucked up again
I just be countin' the wins
I jump in pussy and swim
I beat they ass in them timbs

[Chorus]
Please, don't panic (Ooh)
Jackson like Janet (Skrr-skrr)
Ooh, whole 'notha planet (Wait)
I'm too high not landing (Rack)

Ooh, damn, (Damn)
You doin' outstandin' (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Wonder who let niggas in
Sharin' these racks with my friends
Chanel on in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind (Wham)
Quarter back 'n backin'
Fire like a dragon
Big racks, pockets saggin'
Balmain in my fashion

[Chorus]
Please, don't panic (Ooh)
Jackson like Janet (Skrr-skrr)
Ooh, whole 'notha planet (Wait)
I'm too high not landing (Rack)
Ooh, damn, (Yeah, yeah)
You doin' outstandin' (Skrr-skrr)
Ooh, damn, (Ooh)
You doin' outstandin', hey
Please, don't panic (Skrr-skrr)
Jackson like Janet (Ooh, ya)
Whole 'notha planet (Yeah, yeah)
I'm too high not landing (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh, damn
You doin' outstandin' (Skrr-skrr)
Ooh, damn, (Damn)
You doin' outstandin' (Yeah)
