[Intro]
Goat shit
Yeah, uh

[Chorus]
Feel like Juelz Santana, I'm that nigga I
Need some shades for diamonds 'cause they so bright
I'ma show you how to live that goat life
I'ma show you how to live that goat life
Feel like Juelz Santana, I'm that nigga I
Need some shades for diamonds 'cause they so bright
I'ma show you how to live that goat life
I'ma show you how to live that goat life

[Verse 1]
See I made it out the A, chain like Kool-Aid
Kick, push; coast, feel like Lupe
Told my momma that we got it, yeah, we too straight
Love when my shawty put her hair in two braids
Back in highschool love them bitches that go both ways
Pull my chain out, call that bitch a snow day
Living comfortable, ooh, that's that goat life
And these bitches miss my dick, that's that goat life

[Chorus]
Feel like Juelz Santana, I'm that nigga I
Need some shades for them diamonds 'cause they so bright
I'ma show you how to live, yeah that goat life
I'ma show you how to live, yeah that goat life
Feel like Juelz Santana, I'm that nigga I
Need some shades for them diamonds 'cause they so bright
I'ma show you how to live, yeah that goat life
I'ma show you how to live, yeah that goat life (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Tear that pussy down, fresh like silk rice
Cartier on my lenses, that nigga don't write
Freestyle on that bitch, ooh I don't write
Say you 'bout a damn check, but you broke, right?
That don't add up, I'm the goat type
She the type to put it in, and she don't bite
She a freaky type, slurp you up, "good night"
And she wrap her hair up, she the hood type, yeah

[Hook]
Yeah i Feel like Juelz Santana, I'm that nigga I
Need some shades for them diamonds 'cause they so bright
I'ma show you how to live, yeah that goat life
I'ma show you how to live, yeah that goat life
Yeah i Feel like Juelz Santana, I'm that nigga I
Need some shades for them diamonds, yeah they so bright
I'ma show you how to live, yeah that goat life
I'ma show you how to live, yeah that goat life
Ooh
