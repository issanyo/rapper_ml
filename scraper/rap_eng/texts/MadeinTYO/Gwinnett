[Hook]
I used to stay on north side, that's Gwinett
She only hit me up when she want sex
I left that bitch and got right to a check
I drop these bands and watered up my neck
Oh, yah, had to go and get it right
Had to go and get it right, had to go and get it right
Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, had to go and get it right
Had to go and get it right
Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, hit that bitch with all my might

[Verse 1]
Got my bread right, moved up out the 8
My new girl say she love me every day
Baskin' Robbin's, eat that pussy straight
Got my check up, curve these hoes all day
I feel like Kobe ballin' in LA
I feel like Kobe ballin' in LA
Oh, oh, shawty take off your dress
She's so freaky, she's so freaky, yeah she's making a mess
Oh, she want me deep in her neck
Tokyo, Tokyo, gettin' a check
Oh, Tokyo, you the man
I might just move to Japan
She wanna hold these bands
I got these bands in my pants
Oh, yeah, I got a lot of that
Oh, I got a lot of that
Oh, shawty bring it back

Hit that bitch with all my might

[Verse 2]
Damn, put your chin out like a boxer
That's not my girlfriend, damn what do you call her?
I used to have 5 bitches on the roster
Palace coat, smokin' dope, eatin' some lobster
Damn, she type to suck you up for a water cup
Louie loafers, copped 'em, yeah just to warm 'em up
Deadstock ones, ugh, they ain't been touched
Remember when a young nigga didn't have much
Made it paid, made it paid
Made it human, human made
Fresh racks with the fade
Hundred racks at the blaze
Turn it up, burn it up, oh
Turn it up, burn it up, oh, ah, ah, oh

[Hook]

Oh, yah, had to go and get it right
Had to go and get it right, had to go and get it right
Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, had to go and get it right

Hit that bitch with all my might
Oh, hit that bitch with all my might
