Geeked up in follies 'til I pass out
Backwood shawty 'til I pass out
Baby keep it tight until I pass out
Ballin' baby, feel like Jerry Stackhouse
Geeked up in follies 'til I pass out
Backwood shawty 'til I pass out
Baby keep it tight until I pass out
Ballin' ballin', feel like Jerry Stackhouse
(Ballin' ballin', feel like Jerry Stackhouse)

[Verse - Knott Strader]

Ok
Dozen PC's around me, Call me Bill Gates
If you leave your shit behind you might get your shit taken
Everybody real around me, Your bitch ass been fakin'
This bitch tryna' eat me  like a fuckin' piece a bacon
I knew ass would laugh this shit is just Tussaud
All this bitches on me Like I'm Ugly God
Who the fuck is you? (x2)
You gon' run up on my partna', we gone take your shoe's
I told everybody that i'm in my Knott Zone
Everybody rocking with me, they're  in Knott Zone
Once the parties done, the nigga i'm gone
Bitch i feel like Kobe Bryant, Mamba out now, Okay
