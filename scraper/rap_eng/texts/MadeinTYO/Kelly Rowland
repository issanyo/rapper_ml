Hey, skrr skrr

[Bridge]
If she thick and bad little nigga better have the dro
Two Bape jackets, fuck that ima need fo'
If she pressed as fuck, fuck that little bitch I let it go
You be looking like 12, start cuffing all these hoes

[Hook - 2x]
No limit, but I get my roll on
No Kelly Rowland, big face hun don
Push the gas, then you know that I'm gone
Shawty thick, can't wear a thong
Shawty thick, can't wear a thong

[Verse 1]
Hey, sushi with the plate
Hey, I took her on a date
Hey, push the gas then I'm gone
Hey, she ain't wearing thongs

[Refrain - 4x]
Kelly, Kelly
Rowland, Rowland

[Bridge]
If she thick and bad little nigga better have the dro
Two Bape jackets, fuck that ima need fo'
If she pressed as fuck, fuck that lil bih I let it go
You be looking like 12 start cuffing all your hoes

[Hook - 2x]
No limit, but I get my roll on
No Kelly Rowland, big face hun don
Push the gas, then you know that it's going
Shawty thick, can't wear a thong
Tryna make my money long

[Outro]
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Rowland (4x)
Rowland, Rowland, Rowland, Rowland
Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Rowland (3x)
