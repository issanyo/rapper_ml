[INTRO/HOOK: RonnyJ]
Friday in LA (x8)

[Verse 1: RonnyJ]
Me brodie in the hills with it
Shawty know the deal with it
Gucci in the hills with it
The money got us goin' crazy
I never let that lie change me
Everywhere I go I get bitches to come with me
Imma give her what she want, what she really need
Everything feels right, (yeah)
She'll be back tonight (yeah)
But she can't spend the night (yeah)
I gotta catch a flight (yeah)
You know there no stoppin
Imma keep on droppin
Anything I want I cop it
Roses got her pussy throbbin

[HOOK: RonnyJ]
Friday in LA (x8)

[Verse 2: MadeinTYO]
Geekin off a edible
No cap goin federal
Plant deep blowin hella smoke
She so bad i can't let her go
Pardon i can't wait
Baddie never late
Park the car in valley
And you rollin on the skates
Know they can not play me
Wonder why they hate me
Cuz my diamonds wavy
Got a bad baby
Pull up in Mercedes yeah im goin crazy (oh)
Diamonds on me stay
Friday in LA slidin with yo bae
Diamonds on me stay
Friday in LA slidin with yo bae

[HOOK: RonnyJ]
