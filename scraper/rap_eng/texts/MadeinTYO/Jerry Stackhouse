[Verse]
I'ma fuck your bitch until I pass out
I'ma smoke this kush until I pass out
I'ma flex up until I pass out
I be at the bank you know I cash out
I'ma fuck your bitch until I pass out
I be in the VIP you know I cash out
I'ma fuck your bitch until I pass out
You know that I turned up to the max now
Geeked up in them valleys 'til I pass out
Backwood shawty 'til I pass out
Baby keep it tight until I pass out
Ballin' baby, feel like Jerry Stackhouse
Geeked up in them valleys 'til I pass out
Backwood shawty 'til I pass out
Baby keep it tight until I pass out
Ballin' ballin', feel like Jerry Stackhouse
(Ballin' ballin', feel like Jerry Stackhouse)

Ballin' ballin', feel like Jerry Stackhouse
Ballin' ballin', feel like Jerry Stackhouse
