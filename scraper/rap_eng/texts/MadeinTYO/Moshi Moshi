Ooh, yuh!

Baby I'm feelin' jood, tryna bite up on your leg
Air force matchin', house like a mansion
Typewriter, you a biter, twerk it when you dancin'
Baby my little winter hair lock
All my shit is deadstock
All my feelings dead, stop
Got a plug in Shibuya yeah, for the deadstock
Talking 'bout my niggas, yeah, get your head popped
Baby I'm the wave, I ain't never gon' stop

[Chorus]
Ayy, Moshi Moshi

Ayy, Moshi Moshi
(Got the plug in, for the deadstock)

Bapes hangin' off the wheel, hit it then I got it though
Went out wit' you bitch, capital, dinner shit
That's a lot of sus' kid, blow it, yeah they can't skid
