[Hook - Royce Rizzy]
Grew up hella' fast cause I had to
Same nigga say he fuck with you will stab you
You was hyping up your man and you was mad to
I was hyping up my brother, I was glad to
I'm the type of nigga that they bring the bag to
I'm the type of nigga that they bring the bag to
I'm the type of nigga that they bring the bag to
Cause I had too, cause I had too

[Verse 1 - Royce Rizzy and Madeintyo]
I was broken, had no car up in these roads
Knew God was working, he was working on my soul
Now I see the mountains pulling out the driveway
Niggas say they pop it low key thinking sideways
Cousin in my phone, bitch you know I had you
That bitch ain't going nowhere, swear that she a statue
You keep on tripping, I had enough then come right at you
Let's pop a cup, bitch you know we need that bag too
What you wanna do? Where you gotta go?
I be fucking up a cheque when I'm on a roll
What you gon' do? Where you gotta go?
I be fucking up a cheque when I'm on a roll

[Hook - Royce Rizzy]
Grew up hella' fast cause I had to
Same niggas, say he fuck with you will stab you
You was hyping up your man and you was mad to
I was hyping up my brother, I was glad to
I'm the type of nigga that they bring the bag to
I'm the type of nigga that they bring the bag to
I'm the type of nigga that they bring the bag to
Cause I had too, cause I had too

[Verse 2 - Royce Rizzy and Madeintyo]
Cause I had to
Fucking with a bad one, you got two
If you rolling with me then I got you
If you rolling with me then I got you
Should I pull up? Man I feel like Bruce Wayne
You just spent 150 on a blue flame
Magic City, money boy, I need a 20 piece
She said the pussy mine, I hop right on 20 Es
Got it out the mud, they'll tell you 'bout it
What your dad tell you 'bout it?
Getting to the money, I can tell you 'bout it
Swear that I can tell you 'bout it

[Hook - Royce Rizzy]
Grew up hella' fast cause I had to
Same niggas, say he fuck with you will stab you
You was hyping up your man and you was mad to
I was hyping up my brother, I was glad to
I'm the type of nigga that they bring the bag to
I'm the type of nigga that they bring the bag to
I'm the type of nigga that they bring the bag to
Cause I had to, cause I had to
