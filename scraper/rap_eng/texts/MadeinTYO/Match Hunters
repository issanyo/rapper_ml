How much you made today? I've made a couple of racks
Yeah, that shit sound fire, had to run that shit back

[Verse 2: Xavier Wulf]
Okay, we pull up servin', saucing', bust a bitch and pull off
Bitch, you run it how you want when you the boss and that's all
Shorty hit me ten times, ain't callin' back, she cut off
Spin a bitch like my wheels, we all Forgi them all
Pull up screamin', who is who, I'm one of the coldest there are
Every time I saw that bitch, I left her right where she started
You tryna downplay me, find you some help, you retarded
Young and old, you hatin' niggas need to find a new hobby
You bitch

Yeah, that shit sound fire, had to run that shit back
Yeah, my bitch on ten, but I picked up like thirty
If I'm hoppin' out the coupe, then you know that it's dirty
How much you made today? I've made a couple of racks
Yeah, that shit sound fire, had to run that shit back
