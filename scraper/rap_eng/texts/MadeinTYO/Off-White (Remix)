[Intro: Rich The Kid, Global Dan, & MadeinTYO]
You know what I'm saying
You know how the fuck we rollin'
Shout out my nigga, shout out to my nigga Virgil
You dig? Off-White shit bitch
Yeah, uh, aye, yeah
Sauce

[Chorus: Global Dan]
I just pulled up in LA, wearin' Off White (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I can't even fuck with her, she don't act right
Call my old jawn 'cause she throw that back right
Now I'm countin' money, throw it in the bag like (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1: Global Dan]
Yeah I see that brand new Benz from a distance (yeah, yeah, yeah)
I don't know you, we not friends, keep your distance
I don't really fuck with them, they be trippin'
Keep a .38 inside my Scottie Pippens (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Drinkin' that lean like it's coffee, ooh (syrup)
I feel like nothin' can stop me, ooh
All these thotties they be sloppy
Wanna run up on me, hit 'em like Rocky, damn
Now I'm feelin' like Chris, ayy
Diamonds dancin' on my wrist, ayy
Diamonds dancin' like Rihanna
Coolin' with Chapo, I'll see you ma√±ana
Trapping inside the cabana
Tony Montana, flippin' that work for the Prada
I just want all of the money, fuck up some commas
I got no time for no drama
Coolin' with Mongo, we makin' a movie, your mama
Prolly somewhere in Bahamas

[Chorus: Global Dan & Rich The Kid]
I just pulled up in LA, wearin' Off White (yeah, yeah, yeah, huh)
I can't even fuck with her, she don't act right (what)
Call my old jawn 'cause she throw that back right (brr, brr)
Now I'm countin' money, throw it in the bag like (what, uh)

[Verse 2: Rich The Kid]
I put this shit in the bad, plenty of cash (plenty of cash, what)
My bitch foreign and boujee, she got a bag (she got a bag, bitch)
Cut that bitch off she don't act right (act right)
She suck my dick for some off-white
Pouring up the pint no clean sprite
She brought her friend but it's alright
Do the dash, Givenchy with the tag
Make her mad, pinky ring a jag
For real though, I might just pour out the seal, though
Made more than a mil' on a deal hoe
We broke but we walk on the bankroll

[Chorus: Global Dan & MadeinTYO]
I just pulled up in LA, wearin' Off White (sauce)
I can't even fuck with her, she don't act right (ew)
Call my old jawn 'cause she throw that back right (wait)
Now I'm countin' money, throw it in the bag like

[Verse 3: MadeinTYO]
I can't be waiting in a line
Baby you fine, speaking my mind
Countin' that money rewind
I get that racks all of the time
Off-white off white
She can get it on sight
She wanna eat, I wanna eat
(Ooh)
Let's get a bite
Yeah I mix Louis V yeah with that off-white
I could make that money, yeah, if I talk right
Bad bitch, slim waist, shit that's my type
Put her in that designer yeah now she walk right
Stylin' out with Virgil
Smoking on that purple
Moving like a turtle
Dripping like a Squirtle
I see haters in my distance
Waving like I'm fishing
Cooking up with no kitchen
007, no mission

[Chorus: Global Dan]
I just pulled up in LA, wearin' Off White
I can't even fuck with her, she don't act right
Call my old jawn 'cause she throw that back right
Now I'm countin' money, throw it in the bag like
