[Hook](x2)
Stupid flex, I'm getting cake
Throwing racks up in my face
Drop it low, sit on my face
Fuck with rappers, no way

[Verse 1]
Kush in all my zips
Baby thick I grab her hip
Fuck around, and that be it
No more plug stealing shit
Yeah she know where to find me
She stuffed in the tommy
Niggas tryna sign me
But you know how I be

[Hook] (x2)
Stupid flex on gang k
Throwing racks up in my face
Drop it low, sit on my face
Fuck with rappers, no way
