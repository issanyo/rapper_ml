[Hook]
If you ain't in Gwinett, I'm probably gettin' a check
Thought I threw a pool party how these hoes gettin' wet
Long socks on (woah)
Gas in my bong (hey)
Shawty drop your thong (skrt skrt)
Tats on my arm (hey)
Boo packin' a blunt, shawty you ain't ready
1738, Tokyo get fetty
Long socks on (hey)
Gas in my bong (skrt skrt)
Shawty drop your thong (gas)
Tats on my arm (woah)

[Verse]
Shawty too damn fine, let me put in work (smash)
See that ass hangin' out a damn denim skirt (wham)
Racks in the damn bed, you didn't do it first (sauce)
You wear that messenger bag, it look like a purse (ew)
Told me shawty she been workin', we can cash out (cash)
Magic City with the Fendi, got that ass out (sauce)
Give me top in a drop, I might pass out (wham wham)
Give me top in a drop, I might pass out (wham wham)

[Hook]
Long socks on (ay)
Gas in my bones (hey)
Shawty drop your thong (skrt skrt)
Tats on my arm (sauce)
Long socks on (hey)
Gas in my bones (skrt skrt)
Shawty drop your thong (woah)
Tats on my arm (hey)
