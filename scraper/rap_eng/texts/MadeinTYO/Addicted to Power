[Chorus]
Ooh, baby addicted to power, uh
Suck on my nuts in the shower, uh (Ooh)
Cookie I mix with the sour (Gas)
Hit it from back like a coward (Wet)
Your favorite rapper wanna sign me (Skrrt)
My jacket like, "Where did you find me?"
House big, house big, ooh, trouble to find me (Ooh)
I get a check, ooh, make it enough (Ooh)
I heard you sick, ew, ain't savin' enough, uh
Gimme the sloppy, we happy
Stop textin' me, send me the addy
Rockin' designer, all baggy
I got your backend in my avi (Ooh)

She give me head like I'm Stewie
Spit on my shit like a lougie
Keeping it rollin' like movie (Skrrt skrrt)
Why your diamonds lookin' fluey?
Damn, my son in Gucci (Damn)
Damn, that's lil' Truey, uh (Damn)

If you got plugged, then nigga, just loop me (Okay)

Baby addicted to power, uh (Skrrt, skrrt)
Suck on my nuts in the shower, uh (Ooh)

Hit it from back like a coward (Wet)
Your favorite rapper wanna sign me (Skrrt)
My jacket like, "Where did you find me?"
House big, house big, ooh, trouble to find me (Ooh, racks)
I get a check, ooh, make it enough (Ooh)

[Verse 2]
Back house in a Jacuzzi, uh
Suckin' me up when she do me, uh
Niggas is sus, niggas is sus, uh, niggas is fruity, uh (Skrrt, skrrt)
How much you spend for that coat?
Makin' them plays, like a damn coach
Moonwalkin' in the snow, uh

Baby is lit, baby is fine, uh

Niggas is runnin' with nothin', uh
Tellin' them bitches I'm comin', uh

None of my business, be honest, uh
Keep it one hunnid, be honest

Ooh, baby addicted to power, uh
Suck on my nuts in the shower, uh (Ooh)
Cookie I mix with the sour (Gas)
Hit it from back like a coward (Wet)
Your favorite rapper wanna sign me (Skrrt)
My jacket like, "Where did you find me?"
House big, house big, ooh, trouble to find me (Ooh, racks)
I get a check, ooh, make it enough (Ooh)
I heard you sick, ew, ain't savin' enough, uh
Gimme the sloppy, we happy
Stop textin' me, send me the addy
Rockin' designer, all baggy
