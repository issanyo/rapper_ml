Can I whip the lamb it depends
Post you on the gram, it depends
Gucci or the Louis, it depends
Came up on some top, it depends
Yeah, ooh, it depends
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, it depends
Can I whip the lamb it depends
Louis or the Gucci it depends

[Verse 1]
Suitcase
Two face
Blue face
Hunnid
They don’t really fucking want it
She gon’ feel it in her stomach
Cornbread, skin
Go ‘head, din
Two steps then I win
Double up dividends

[Hook]
Can I whip the lamb, it depends
Post you on the gram, it depends
Gucci or the Louis, it depends
Came up on some top, it depends
Yeah, ooh, it depends
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, it depends

[Verse 2]
Yeah

She make her back bend
She from Australia, she got an accent
I run the fucking youth
That’s on my gold tooth
Ugh, turn around, beat her down, turn into Goku
Ugh, power nap, pop a xan, take her to sofu
Yeah, hang out with Big Sean, that nigga’s so cool
Yeah, enter the back couch, turn on the pro tools
Ooh, don’t run up on me, I’ma loose my cool
Ugh, running them bands up
Y’all niggas mad huh?
Oh, she from the southside, sippin’ that Fanta
Ugh, throw the racks on her, like she a dancer
Ugh, ass on Luda, bruh, tell her to stand up

[Hook]
Can I whip the lamb, it depends
Post you on the gram, it depends

Yeah, ooh, it depends
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, it depends
Can I whip the lamb, it depends
Louis or the Gucci it depends
