Probably in Japan, chopsticks in my hand with that '05 Bape
Rick Owens on my pants, all my tracks slick, oh, need a track fit
Steph Curry with the husk, GQ with the looks
I wonder what my son be thinking
Cook cook cook, no apron
Mumble on the beat when you blazing
Make sure you look good 'cause they taping
Human Made on, no Bathing
Save no hoes, no cape man
This that mumble rap, mumble rap
Old heads really want none of that, yeah, they want none of that
Oh, they want none of that
That mumble rap, mumble rap
Old heads really want none of that, yeah, they want none of that
Oh, they want none of that
