La MÃºsica de Harry Fraud

[Verse 1]
Never take a L, Saint Laurent smell
Mr. big bank, hand it out well
Mr. big drip, wet like a whale
Shawty wanna kiss but I never will tell, uh
She wanna see like a pimp, uh
Parmesan cheese with the shrimp (sauce)
Check yeah, indeed I limp, uh
Harry Fraud play that shit, uh
Waking up, getting the bag, uh
Fuck it up, flex on these niggas, uh
Make a hater fucking mad, uh
I need a check from these niggas, uh
Calabasas with the hoodie on
[?] get my boogie on
Me and Swae, Hidden Hills with it
Lil bitch wanna chill with it

[Chorus]
Raise the roof, uh, ayy, ooh, like Derek Jeter, yeah
Got her jumping, uh, yeah like a rabbit, uh, yeah
Raise the roof, ooh, yeah, coupe like gadget
Got it jumping, yeah, yeah, like a rabbit, yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Uh, want a ball hog, never pass
Where you going with all that ass?
Young nigga and I want it bad
Tokyo got it, lil goo bag
Pull up like "Who's that?"
Mister yeah more than two plaques
Tied up like a durag
And they really want my shoes bad
You a lame nigga, full cap
And my bitch bad like B.A.B
Nike collab with CDG
She wanna play me like MP3
Gotta take note like test [?]

Gotta work, don't hold me

[Chorus]
Raise the roof, uh, ayy, ooh, like Derek Jeter, yeah
Got her jumping, uh, yeah like a rabbit, uh, yeah
Raise the roof, ooh, yeah, coupe like gadget
Got it jumping, yeah, yeah, like a rabbit, yeah, yeah
