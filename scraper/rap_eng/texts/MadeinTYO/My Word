[Hook: 24hrs]
Goin' on the road, I kept my word
Stayed real with my niggas, I kept my word
Cut off these hoes, I kept my word
Makin' money for the team, I kept my word
And you deserve it
I kept my word
You deserve it
I kept my word, I kept my word

[Verse 1: MadeinTYO]
I remember when I met you
We ain't even talk about your damn life
Now we got one on the way, baby girl
All we do is talk about our damn fuckin' life
Seem like every day I'm gone and your stomach still growin'
Swear it don't even feel damn right
I promise I'll make it up to you
Yeah I'll make it up to you
You got my word, you got my word
You got my word, you got my word
You got my word, you got my word
I put in work, I put in work
Baby got my word
You got my word
You got my word
You got my word, word

[Hook: 24hrs]
Goin' on the road, I kept my word
Stayed real with my niggas, I kept my word
Cut off these hoes, I kept my word
Makin' money for the team, I kept my word
And you deserve it
I kept my word
You deserve it
I kept my word, I kept my word

[Verse 2: 24hrs]
I kept my word, I never lied
I held you tight when you cried
I picked you up, the north side
Text your phone like, "the ride is outside"
I had no car, but you was down
I ain't had no money, you stayed around
You left your last nigga, he was a clown
'Cause you heard how Twenty put it down
She said, "Twenty keep it real with me
I know you kept your word but still
You runnin' through my mind
You runnin' through my mind
Want you to be all mine"

[Hook: 24hrs]
Goin' on the road, I kept my word
Stayed real with my niggas, I kept my word
Cut off these hoes, I kept my word
Makin' money for the team, I kept my word
And you deserve it
I kept my word
You deserve it
I kept my word, I kept my word
