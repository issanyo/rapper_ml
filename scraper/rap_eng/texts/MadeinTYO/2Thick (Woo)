[Intro]
Hey
Woah, woah, woah

[Hook: Royce Rizzy]
Too thick, too thick, too thick, too thick, too thick
Two zips, two whips, two bitch, she too thick
Too thick, too thick, too thick, too thick, she too thick
Two zips, two whips, two bitch, she too thick, she too thick

[Verse 1]
Boobs, lips, ass, hips
Follys, Fipps
I smoke a zip
Raf Simons on, yeah
And my gas strong
Say you from Decatur yeah
Where your mouth from?
Sauce on my outfit, driveway long
Air BnB, shawty can't stay long
That boy (?) that's what got the wave from
Krispy Kreme, little thing, little blaze ones
Too thick, I gas my whip
Shawty comin' to the crib, I'ma need some lips
Too thick, I gas my whip
Shawty comin' to the crib, I'ma need them lips

[Hook: Royce Rizzy]
Too thick, too thick, too thick, too thick, too thick
Two zips, two whips, two bitch, she too thick
Too thick, too thick, too thick, too thick, she too thick
Two zips, two whips, two bitch, she too thick, she too thick

[Verse 2]
Cellphone ringin' boo
Walk in Neiman woah
Told her dad I love her but I didn't mean it fool
Cellphone ringin' boo
Walk in Neiman woah
Told her dad I love her but I didn't mean it fool
She want daddy woah

Know that I'm nasty boo, know that I'm nasty boo

You too thick, too thick, too thick, too thick
You thick, too thick, too thick, too thick
