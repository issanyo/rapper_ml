Hey, skrt-skrt

[Verse 1]
Take the top off, yeah let's make a movie
Water hot, new spot in the jacuzzi
I cut that bih off, please don't be a groupie
Bust a check, don't flex, shit don't move me
All these niggas fucking average, swear you wasting time
Face card good bih I don't wait in line
Pussy boy, I seen your girl swear she not fine
If she a freak I get the cheeks, hit it from behind

[Hook]
Like smash-smash-smash, hold up sheesh, let me put in work
Five on the jeans, dropped seven on the shirt
Smash-smash-smash, hold up sheesh, let me put in work
Five on the jeans, dropped seven on the shirt
