[Verse 1]
To the moon
Through the stars
With you
My heart
Youth
Where we start
And truth
You're a work of art
I be in Duluth
You're off Boulevard
Things that we could bloom
Never fall apart

[Hook]
I think I'm drifting somewhere far
I want to know who you are

[Verse 2]
Crazy
I wonder why I'm not datin'
Can't imagine havin' babies
Or even gettin' an engagement
So slow it down, I'ma take it, pace it
We ain't even go to space yet
Never a replacement
Like a gem but I'm jaded
In my space you invadin'
Mind comtemplatin'
Need a conversation
To control my temptation

[Hook]

[Bridge](x2)
I wanna know
What's ya' favorite song?
Tell me where you from
And do I turn you on?
Can you slow it down?
Can you slow it down?
