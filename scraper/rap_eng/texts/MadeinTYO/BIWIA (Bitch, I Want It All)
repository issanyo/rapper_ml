[Intro: Madeintyo]
Skr, skr
Sauce
808
Tyo
Trippy shit

[Verse 1: Madeintyo]
Spend it all, make it back
Don't know how to act
Bitch, I feel like Will Smith
Skr, skr, heart attack
No Jade and Willow
Two shorty cellphone
Don't pass it no mo'
Throw it out the window
I'mma need my bread low
I don't fuck with dead hoes
Gucci on a speedboat
Thousand dollars weed, whoa
Peanut butter peacoat
Steph Curry free throws
More haters, need more
Keep it on the d-low
Bape out in UK
You ain't never seen those

[Hook: Madeintyo]

[Verse 2: Madeintyo]
Bitch, I want it all
I just wanna ball
Baby blunt, skip those
Only fuck with deepthroats
If it ain't about the check
Why you niggas call for?
Colorado, outta pocket
Passport, flight, mileage
Where you been? Where you at?
Tokyo, I'm on the map
Thick hoes on my lap
Baby wanna hit a dab
Foreign jawns into that
Subwoofer in the back

[Hook: Madeintyo]
Bitch, I want it all

Bad bitch, she heard it all

[Verse 3: Madeintyo]
Fucking these bitches, I'm outta state
Cartier lenses and Louis plates
Trips to [?] Thomas is no getting away
Baby, I know that you on the way
I think that the foreign hoes outta state
Heard you make money, you living straight
'Seppes on Benihana date
Skipping the line, don't gotta wait

[Verse 4: Tommy Genesis]
40 acres ski hill
Higher than [?]
Ever see me crawl?
Bet you heard it all
Rapping like you Meek Mill
Tell you mad with me still
Paradise is evil
Fucking up your sequel
Gucci leanin afterlife
Goldstar on your shattered gold
Gold bitch on your golden crib
Silver plated hoe, she thick
Hoe you need your Chris Paul
Bet you thought you heard it all
Bet you thought you heard it all
Bet you thought you heard it all
This bitch thought she heard it all
