[Billie Eilish]
You make me sad, boy
I look sad, daddy

[Madein TYO]
Bitch, [?] or a kisses (I would)
Wanna lay down with your misses
(Oh yeah)
Wanna hear your heartbeat (listen up)
When we're apart we [?]

[Unknown]
Cause we don't really talk
I cry and you console
But you can't make me stop
Cause I won't take control
You got me on all fours
The only play I roll
There's nothing I love more
Than doing what I'm told
