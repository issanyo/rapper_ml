[Chorus: 10k.Caash]
Swajjur blast, this a blast from the past (Past)
Who
Show the stats on your ass, this is 10k and I got the cash (Yeah)
I used to skip the math class, but I’m really, really good at math (Duh)
How low can you add? Three times three, what is that?

[Verse 1: 10k.Caash]
That’s nothing, I’m tryna beat out her spine
I’m walkin’ real clumsy and my legs are on my eyes (Skr)
What’s goin’ wrong with my mind? I need some help, Frankenstein (Ew)
Hola, hello? This kush, it made me choke
My legs, they broke (Ah), I’m dippin’ on the floor (I’m dippin’)

[Chorus: 10k.Caash & MadeinTYO]
Swajjur blast, this a blast from the past (Past)
Show the stats on your ass, this is 10k and I got the cash (The cash)
I used to skip the math class, but I’m really, really good at math (Duh)
How low can you add? Three times three, what is that?
Swajjur blast, this a blast from the past (Past)
Show the stats on your ass, this is 10k and I got the cash (Ooh)
I used to skip the math class, but I’m really, really good at math (Duh)
How low can you add (Skr)? Three times three, what is that (Skr)?

[Verse 2: MadeinTYO]
Yeah, swag blast (Okay), dip, jump in your bag (Skr)
Louis tag (Ooh), they wanna steal and they mad (Sauce, who got sauce?)
You got them bitches, but where they be at? I got a bucket my hat (Tuh)
She wanna fuck, but she got a whole man, she got that ass in my hand (Skr)
Turkey, I’m dressin’, I’m tryna go ham, I did that shit ‘cause I can (Skr)
Tap the cat (Ooh), ooh, splash the cat (Ooh, ew, ooh)
Crazy eyes, got cataracts (Okay, okay), look, a folly guy, I got rack racks (Skr, skr)
Two tone, Daniel Bugone (Skr, skr)
