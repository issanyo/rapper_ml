[Intro: MadeinTYO]
DP Beats on the beat
Yeah, yeah
You own me now, I'm all G'd down
Young, too much checks, ooh, yeah

[Chorus: MadeinTYO]
All I need is one call, I'm on my way
Money makin', always gone but you stay
If you need me baby, hit me up
If you need me baby, hit me up
All I need is one call, I'm on my way
Money makin', always gone but you stay
If you need me baby, hit me up
If you need me baby, hit me up

[Verse 1: MadeinTYO]
Bomb AGs with the Yeezys on play
Like my lil shawty, I gotta shift the way
If you talkin' shit, I take the fade
If you talkin' shit, she take the fade
All I need is a blunt in my bay
I don't trust these niggas, hell yeah, play it safe
If you got a problem, hit me up
If you got a problem, hit me up

[Chorus: MadeinTYO]
All I need is one call, I'm on my way
Money makin', always gone but you stay
If you need me baby, hit me up
If you need me baby, hit me up
All I need is one call, I'm on my way
Money makin', always gone but you stay
If you need me baby, hit me up
If you need me baby, hit me up

[Verse 2: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, all I need is a pack of smoke a day
Money makin' mitch, baby girl, you my ace
If you want that kush, then hit me up
You're the first thing I think of when I wake up
MVP, when I call, you make the play
X-MAX P, baby girl, I'm the wave
Fit you with the stick 'cause you clutch
You gon' see a boss baby if you hit me up
My nigga keep a hammer on him, you can't really touch me
All the women love me, all the OGs trust me
Told my mama I'm gettin' grown, please don't call me lucky
You know I'm there for you, you say that it's really hard to reach me but

[Chorus: MadeinTYO]
All I need is one call, I'm on my way
Money makin', always gone but you stay
If you need me baby, hit me up
If you need me baby, hit me up
All I need is one call, I'm on my way
Money makin', always gone but you stay
If you need me baby, hit me up
If you need me baby, hit me up
