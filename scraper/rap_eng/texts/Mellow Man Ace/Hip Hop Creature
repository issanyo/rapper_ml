[ VERSE 1 ]
You better run and hide when you hear my growl
Cause I'm a hip hop creature, and I'm on the prowl
While I'm talkin I'm stalkin, and rappers are my prey
I creep at night and I sleep all day
I despise the sunrise, swoon the moonrise
Then like a beast I increase in size
But your cries ain't nothin to me, cause I don't pity you
And my mission is to cold get rid of you
Bitin MC's, I'm fightin MC's
Bring em to their knees, plus: "Drive on, please
Spare my life!" but you're a sacrifice
I write the rhymes from the blood drippin off my mic
It ain't Jason, it ain't Poltergeist
Even though the rhymes are fly, it ain't Vincent Price
It's just the first part of the double feature
So you better run, boy, cause I'm the Hip Hop Creature

[ VERSE 2 ]
I make Jeckyll & Hyde seem like Hansel & Gretel
Tom & Jerry, or Albert and Costello
But yo, this ain't slapstick, it's like a horrorflick
And I'm a gool, and I'm here to school
Mediocre rappers with a style that's scary
And eerie, which makes you leary
You not even wanna look in my direction
And grab a cross, and think that's your protection
But yo, this ain't Dracula, that's too regular
I'm much more frightening, especially when lighning
Strikes, and it's 12 midnight
You're in for the scare of your life
Cause it's a frightnight-mare
There's no way you can run, cause I'll reach ya
And furthermore I fight you and I beat ya
And here's the second part of the feature
You better run, homebody, cause I'm the Hip Hop Creature

[ VERSE 3 ]
I'm the Hip Hop Creature, here to do my job
Scare the suckers, cause my monologue is McCobb
That's why MC's see me and try to get chummy
I rap so close around em and they end up like a mummy
Dummy, you gets nothin from me
Except the creeps, so I suggest you keep
A safe distance between you and I
Stay back, like Brooklyn: do or die
Cause I'm 'bout to knock you out like Tyson on a roll
Hit you with a beat, I rhyme outta control
A non-stop attack landin on your brain
You're lookin kinda wobbly, do you know your name?
Now the match is over, I put you in your place
Forget Al Pacino, I'm the Rap Scarface
I got directors flockin to have me in their feature
Coming soon to your town: The Hip Hop Creature
