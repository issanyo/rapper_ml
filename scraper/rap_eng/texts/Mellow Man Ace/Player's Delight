I said a hip-hop-ta-pop the hibby to the hip-hip-hop
A you dont stop a rockin' to the greenside bump
Up jump the boogie to the rythim of the L.S.O.B
Now what you hear is not a test, well I be busin' to this beat
See its me and my dog and the homie Kid Frost
Gonna try to take your freak, haha
See I am ODM and I'd like to save you folk
To the black and the white the red and the brown
And the hynas that are good to go
But first, I gotta bang-bang-da-boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the gangbang boogie lets rock and you dont stop
Rock the rythim that will make your cherry pop
Well so far you've herd my voice but I braught two friends along (zup dogs)
And next up to bust is my homie Kid Frost, Go ahead Frost lace this song

[Frost]
Check it out I'm the K-I-D F-R-O-S-T baby doll its time to ride
See I role with the crew called the G-Spot G's
And these the reasons I'll tell you why
See I'm number one and I'm tons of fun, I'm down to a teeth
And I got more jewels Then all them fools and I dress up preciously
I got body guards, I got five big cars, lift Them front and back
I got a 9 SS Impala, a ? gold Cadillac
Everything is cool I take a dip in the pool
Like deck cause its time to ball
A big screen t.v. so I can see the Lakers play baskeball
Here me talk about checkbook credit card more money
Then a sucker, could ever spin
But I wouldn't give a sucker not dime quarter
Cause its all about jakin them

I'm gonna get my freak and hit them chicks
And drive off in my brand new Range

That's on you, so what you gonna do?

[DTTX]
Well its on and its on and on-on-on-on

Now I'm a P-L-A a Y-E-R a G with a double E
See a we go by the unforgetable clique of Lighter Shade of Brown
You see nooooowwww
My name is known all over the world
By all the true down players and the fly ass girls
And we going down in history
As the baddest playas you ever did see
As you chillin yo highs and you Banging your lows
The feet starts moving down to your toes
You start snappin' your fingers and moving your feet
Your body starts rocking to the shoreshine beat
I said jam you start movin' your feet
I said jam Right out of your seat
Now just throw your hands high in the air
And wave them all around like you dont care
Keep rocking to the beat withought no care
And make sure you come sharp baby for the affair
Now I'm not as tall as the rest of the gang
But I bang to the beat just the same
I got a playas face, and a pair brown eyes
All I'm here to do baby is just hypnotise
Singing on and on-on and on-on
Say the beat dont stop until the break of dawn
I said a 1-2-3-4 a come on y'all a get on the floor
Well come alive y'all  a gimme what you
Got cause I'm guranteed to make you roc

[Mellow Man Ace]
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for an interview
She said she's heard stories she heard fables
That I'm all drugged out still and turn tables
This fly reporter I did adore
I got smooth on that ass and popped the car door
She said damn Mellow Man I'm in love with you
All the stories I've heard they couldn't of been true
By the way sugar whats your name
She said I go by the name ExoticElaine
And you can be my boo kid you surely
Can just let me dump my boyfriend the local bud man
I said he's a Busta I do suppose
Puttin that meth all in your nose
He may be very paid or even cute
But his raps dead Wack you should give him the boot
I said you need Mellow Man I got finesse
I got my name in old english tatted on my chest
He may be able to slang all through the night
But he can't rock a party throught the early light
He may satisfy you with his little worm
But I'm gonna turn that ass out when I get my turn
Im goin'do it, I'm goin' do it, I'm goin' do it do it do it
Cause I'm here and I'm there
Cause I'm Mellow Man Ace and I'm everywhere
So just shock y'all a ticky-tak y'all
You dont stooopp, you keep on
(yes yes yall)
(yes yes yall)
