[Intro: Mellow Man Ace]
Mellow Man Ace is in this motherfucker
From Russia With West

[Chorus: Mellow Man Ace]
What it all comes down to?
It’s that funk
And what it all boils down to?
It’s that funk

[Verse 1: Mellow Man Ace]
Homie I push my line like I push my rhymes
The highest bidder gone get it many time
I invest in self and I keep it stealth
And I roll on sellouts til they pockets melt
That’s the cards that’s dealt forever stay felt
Put the dish on the platta, we burnin’ up the belts
(OG!) OG, and I bails with a limp
And on the West Coast I’m like the Goodyear blimp
I’m so incredible, unforgetable
And to these bitches I’m oh so edible
Shiiit, put cho money where yo month is
And if not shut yo mother fuckin mouth kid
Cuz biz without paper that’s straight up charity
Save your acalades your props and your flattery
Cus when I get on my shit come bump
What it all boils down to? It’s just that funk

[Chorus: Mellow Man Ace]
What it all comes down to?
It’s that funk
And what it all boils down to?
It’s that funk
What it all comes down to?
It’s that funk
And what it all boils down to?
It’s that funk

[Verse 2: G Wylx]
Put your hands up in the air if you listening to this
We give anything but fuck, we da Moscow crips
On the block selling rocks, we like Compton geez
So you like Compton geez, word is bond, bitch please
After all it’s all about party people everywhere
Over here, over there, we don’t care if you care
Throw your westup in the sky like you wanna fly high
But tonight we unite over beat and rhyme
Gangsta funk for your ear, with no shade of a doubt
Give it a Shout if you wanna freak out! Cool out!
Straight From Russia with west is a golden pot
Meddling votes? Are you nuts! Its a core of a plot!
We explode on the scene by all means
I mean I will be laundering fake MCs like jeans and then
You gonna stay in the street so fresh and so clean-clean
G’s gonna shine it over here like bling-bling

[Chorus: Mellow Man Ace]
What it all comes down to?
It’s that funk
And what it all boils down to?
It’s that funk
What it all comes down to?
It’s that funk
And what it all boils down to?
It’s that funk

[Verse 3: Cryptocriminals]
We are always on the block even when we disappear
Have at least a dozen pairs of ears know the atmosphere
Dealers clock thru dark.net, coppers hire IT help
When the clocker pays off nerds getting 20%
Always on the block and we ain’t going anywhere
I mean a part of it is in our hearts forever is there
Showing care telling youth they better stay away
Stay out of the game that has brought so many to shame
Are we always on the block? Man, you already know
Paying visits, gettin phone calls, always on the go
Always on it like a K9 on a felon’s trace
Even when its scary like a nine to a fellas face

[Bridge: Mellow Man Ace]
Wit the dip and the glide, pancakes side to side
Bitches in the back and they all wanna ride (haha)
Party inside and a party outside
The homies got it lit like it’s 4th of July

[Chorus: Mellow Man Ace]
What it all comes down to?
It’s that funk
And what it all boils down to?
It’s that funk
What it all comes down to?
It’s that funk
And what it all boils down to?
It’s that funk

[Outro: Cryptocriminals & Mellow Man Ace]
Throw your hands in the air and wave them thangs
It’s that funk
If life is good and you got money in the bank
It’s that funk
If the Five-O can’t put a thing on you
It’s that funk
If you bang this track while hanging with your crew
It’s that funk
West Coast is in this bitch
It’s that funk
Mellow Man Ace in this bitch
It’s that funk (say what)
From Russia With West
It’s that funk
The nigga Mellow Man Ace in the motherfucking house
It’s that funk
