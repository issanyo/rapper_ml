I'm so crazy
(Yeah)

They claim that I'm deranged and demented
Some people say that tuna's insane with my sentence
I came with intentions, spit game with a vengeance
My brain off them binges 'cause it came off the hinges

My frame is tremendous, I'm strange with my interests
I came rather lifted and my names rather different
On the deck is your record, we came here to switch it
Claiming that you rip it but we came and eclipsed it

And while the world gets desperate and hectic
I'm restless steppin' out on my quest for some next shit
People label me eccentric, eclectic, immensely respected
But convinced he's a head trip

No matter in the flesh or some guest shit
Never second guess that we the best you can mess with
But even though I done perfected the big shit
I'm one sandwich short of a picnic, redic'lis

I'm so crazy, you see I'm so crazy
Sick, insane, crazy, driving these ladies
Out they fuckin' mind, now I got mine, I'm Shwayze

I'm so crazy, you see I'm so crazy
Yeah, I drop science like girls be droppin' babies
Enough to make a brother go crazy

Concentration altered
Designer cannabis tastin' awkward
Got my mind in a place exhausted
Got no tongue I can taste or talk with

So I got to replace my thoughts with that raw shit
Diagnostic checks reveal
I've been blessed with impressive skill
A neck with gills and sex appeal

One of the best in the flesh for real
Like a lucrative investment deal
Keepin' it fresh while the rest should kneel
But soon as you think your vessel is special

All the issues and potential threats can depress you
Certain events meant to test you, can push you
To a point where no one can rescue or reach you
So try to never let the pressure defeat you

Losing your mental faculties ultimately depletes you
But some of us can make it seem seamless
But then word insanity can really mean genius

I'm so crazy, ha, you see I'm so crazy
Sick, insane, crazy, driving these ladies
Out they fuckin' mind, now I got mine, I'm Shwayze

I'm so crazy, yeah, you see I'm so crazy
Yeah, I drop science like girls be droppin' babies
'Cause I'm so crazy

They claimin' that my brain is imprisoned
Some people say that tuna's insane with my vision
They blame my decision to remain on a mission
Its plain that they couldn't stand the flames in the kitchen

My aim and intention refrain from division
Avoid demons swerving in my lane in collision
This is not a game, never shame when I glisten
Full of fire likes its higher octane in my engine

Listen while the world is filled with pointless nonsense
My response is to stimulate your subconscious
Off your rocker? Well, listen to my conference
Keepin' you from going bonkers and stop conflict

Seldom seen 'cause I'm on some James Bond, shit
In fact not the one that you can act nonchalant with
But even though I done perfected the big shit
I'm one sandwich short of a picnic, redic'lis

I'm so crazy, you see I'm so crazy
Sick, insane, crazy, driving these ladies
Out they fuckin' mind, now I got mine, I'm Shwayze

I'm so crazy
(Yeah)
You see I'm so crazy
(Yeah)
I drop science like girls be droppin' babies
'Cause I'm so crazy
(Yeah)
