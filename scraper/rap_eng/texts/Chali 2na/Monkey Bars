This record is particularly good for the youngsters...
Now you get right to the procedure

Now what do you like the most about this
Conflict, consequence, constant evidence
A classic content communicated conference
Whether 5 or 6 whether a number misprint
Or if it seems that you heard it before
If you thought that you would never hear it no more
You should never doubt when we runnin word o' mouth
Be concerned about your health (let's go!)
(wait wait yourself)
Now you know us but it's not the Cold Crush
Four MC's so we ain't the Furious
Not the Force MC's or the 3 from Treacherous
It's a blast from the past from the moment we bust
From whatever we touch, we hold platinum plus
But if our shit go rust, still In God We Trust
Cause it's the second coming
Display a rhyme so stunning
We keep it runnin, and give a shoutout to London
And keep it all, and still perform till the early morn'
Sunset til dawn
I got a word abundance, hold pens by the hundreds
Top speed, guaranteed, we still runnin

I be boombastic
With my terror tactics
Why you actin plastic
Treatin all ya fans like fanatics
We be the upper pair comin' air-tight like Tupperware
Fuck a fear, press ya luck and beware the brigadier

Yea, DJ's be spinnin the records that make up the music
So people can focus whenever the mic has been passed to me

The more drums we have in our kit, the more jobs we can handle
We gonna take a break here..

Lets go. wait wait yaself

Je m'appelle, A-K-I-L known to exhale when I inhale
And you can tell when in the crew I do my duty-o
And swung to the studio
J-5 let the beat bounce
That's what counts without a doubt
So sup grab the mic and pull the magic out ya mouth
We be the rhythm kings, plus rhyme channelings
[I could snare anything] Go ahead

Snare(repeated 21 times)

Light emcee can't match this phatness so we practice
Burnin through walls of wackness
Yo, 2 emcees add a little more spice
So we concentrate on mic's to keep them packed parties tight
*THREE* emcees underground and worldwide
Surgeon general notify that the 5 is certified
*FOUR* emcees at your door once more
When it rains it pours from the heavens to the Earth floor
*FIVE* Elements, vocal instruments super extra strength hip-hop activist
*FIVE* For your mind no time and intertwine
Roll with the rhymes sunset to sunrise
*FIVE* You should know, when we flow, you get what you lookin for
*FIVE* Terrorize ya enterprise
Cuz we dont shoot until we see the whites of ya eyes
Non-stop, real rhyme rockin disc jockeys out record shoppin
Writers doin graphs so bring ya pop lockin
We incorporate the whole of hip hoppin
Non-stop, we keep it up to par
From the metal monkey bars to concrete school yards
It's like written Arabic, comin from right to left
It's hot to def so take a breath and (wait wait yourself)

[Applause + Laughter]
