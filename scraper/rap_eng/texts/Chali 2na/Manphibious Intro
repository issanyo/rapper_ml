Yo, Ladies and gentlemen
I am
The friendly neighborhood baritone
Mr. Chali 2na
2nafish on the stick shift
2na, as in, this MC
Is the verbal Herman Munster, capital C
And Chali 2na
Yes
And well its, the king of the sea
And that’s the way it’s gon’ be
The MC, Yes sir
So make room ‘cause I came to create doom

This is, Manphibian music

2na fish the Mr. Superbad
Traditional fickle
But never superficial fam, more like sacrificial lamb
Human vessel, shoot the shit, equipped with special plans
And the official J5 initials is special brand
Influential band
Besides ?minors? from scraps and byproducts growing up in Chi taught us
To max-imize, hustle, others relax
We grind double to the plan that we hatched in time, bubbles
Partakin’ in mantis actions
Advantage
Stay far away from these planned distractions
And practice ‘till it’s second nature
Till your skills separate yah
Don’t let participation
Make yah a different creature
When yah spit that ether
You gotta keep composure
Discipline is what completes exposure
Keep your focus and delete the posers
Towers will fall enough that can defeat the soldiers
Notice ya’ll if I stick to this protocol
My opponents fall, if you wanna sink
You know to call fish, the black skinned Bluefin
I can show you where the lies start and the facts and the truth end
While these vampires cast no reflection
They hologram a dead rapper’s astral projection
For cash and recognition
Bastards disrespect tradition
This clash helped crash the record business
You think it’s different at first
Until you witness the wicked demons and witches at work
It resembles the pictures at church
Where people are burnt
That’s what you get for rippin’ the verse
It’s a gift and a curse
Makin sure my scripts concurrent
For you fish deterrents
You’re the reason I swim against the current
But this is part 2, Manphibian music
