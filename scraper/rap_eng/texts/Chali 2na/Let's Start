[Intro - Fela Kuti]
We are gonna play for you, our first tune
And the first tune is called
O l'oun t'awa se n'yara
Je k'abere
Now, which means
"Let's start what we have come into the room to do"
Here goes

[Verse - Chali 2na]
Let’s start
The revolution movin’ at it’s own pace
Start the process and progress to home base
Put in the motion till it floats and it shows grace
And when the whole place performin’ the soul breaks
We open the cold case and inspect the murder scene
And every word’ll bring clarity; I’m the verbal king
And yes my record is clean, step on the scene
Like a lean mean wreckin' machine
Treacherous things start happening when the stage is lit
Amazing shit that send the people into raging fits
For you haters who try to act like you ain’t phased a bit
But wishin’ it was you up there that played these hits
I suggest you take a second to recollect the weapon that I’m holding
I follow the code of What’s Golden
Smoulderin’ hot shit, call the fire department
We guaranteed to light up the darkness with art, so
Let’s start

[Chorus: Cx]
We get it started off the top, quick hot shit to flick off any topic
Let’s Start
Create the groove that make you move
Throw your hands up while Chali 2na sparks it
Let’s Start
We get it started off the top, quick hot shit to flick off any topic
Let’s Start
Create the groove that make you move
Throw your hands up while Chali 2na sparks it
Let’s Start

The program, the get up and go plan
I’m entrepreneurial, my new material goes ham
And shows stamina, so cold I froze cameras
And I oppose famine while my foes pose glamourous
And posture themselves
Tryin’ to play the position
Of a mobster but shells disintegrate your intention
To be popular
My ocular see yah just like binoculars
Talkin’ bout topic proper so people can stay top of the facts
You can stop in your tracks
Poppin’ your smack
You ain’t strong enough to stop an attack
Hop in the back
We shotgun
You play your top shot off but you not
When we came to try and thicken up the plot some
Sick enough to drop bombs verbally
Chali 2na.com certainly
We froze in emergency inadvertently
Smoulderin’ hot shit, call the fire department
We guaranteed to light up the darkness with art, so
Let's Start

[Chorus: Cx]
We get it started off the top, quick hot shit to flick off any topic
Let’s Start
Create the groove that make you move
Throw your hands up while Chali 2na sparks it
Let’s Start
We get it started off the top, quick hot shit to flick off any topic
Let’s Start
Create the groove that make you move
Throw your hands up while Chali 2na sparks it
Let’s Start
(What we have come into the room to do)

[Outro: Nigel Hall]
We came to- We came to get started
Do what we gotta do
Came to get started
Get started

We came to- We came to get started
Do what we gotta do
Came to get started
Get started

We came to- We came to get started
Do what we gotta do
Came to get started
Get started

We came to- We came to get started
Do what we gotta do
Came to get started
Get started

We came to- We came to get started
Do what we gotta do
Came to get started
Get started
