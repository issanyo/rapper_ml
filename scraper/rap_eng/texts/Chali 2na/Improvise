[Jurassic 5 together]
Ayo, it's like this when the Lord says "Let it be light"
We are some designated, poetical brothers with mics
For whoever had skills to possess the gift
Combinated with the flavor and it goes like this...Tuna Fish!

[Chali 2na]
I'm amphibious, citizen with the lesson plan
Cashier at the J5 concession stand (Akil!)

[Akil]
The militant steel with the peripheral
Telegraphic skill bulid up crossfield (Mark 7even!)

[Mark 7even]
Fundamentalist brining my verbal gift
My style is packed Quik like cocca in Swiss Miss (Zaakir!)

[Zaakir]
For the way my pen sticks to rhymes
Cause a million party people, it's about that time

[Jurassic 5]
And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drums
Taking four MC's and make them sound like one

[Akil]
I be the spark from the cannon, blaze the outstanding
Tug of war, with the poor, rich, and scandlous
Roadrunning bandit, race against advancment
Style winds cause storms when I perform

[Mark 7even]
I'm a ?Parker John robot? and stomp your whole spot
And beat you whole crew to a bunch of know-nots
Dissect you from the inner then declare myself the winner
Once the style clears, you'll be (real like Finner)

[Chali 2na]
One of the black your contractor
Attacking your backdoor, you're trapped in my trash compactor
Move back, whore, swingings before the trap door
It's causin the capture of brothers who rap more

[Zaakir]
Yeah, check the shelling, rock niggas redder than watermelon
The grief-stricken, rotated 20/20 vision
Rap felon, hottest rebel with bad spelling
I pitch shift with unprecedented sharpness

[Jurassic 5]
Distributor, local street corner contributor
Word inhibitor, scientific positioner
Rhythm commision be J's for real
"He drives the corssfader like a cutmobile"

We prepetrate the fake, the fraud, the phony
Jurassic Masters of the Ceremony
You came and saw right before your eyes
In fact the old school flavor has survived, like this...

(Instrumental breakdown)

And together, we show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drums
We taking four MC's and make 'em sound like one

And together, we show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
So whoever bought the tape bring your butt right back
Cause you never in your life heard a cut like that

[Zaakir]
Hey, we flip fast phonographs 45 records smash
High was the forecast, ain't nothing they never had

[Mark 7even]
Make a move, never lose, competition quick to choose
New styles, hot rhymes, guarenteed to blow your mind
[Chali 2na]
(Who is he?) The subtle ?? fanatic for unity
Demonstratin the ghetto diplomatic immunity

[Akil]
Well I'm the style stimulist, sound photosynthesis
Super with the sentences in the Latin centuries

[Jurassic 5]
And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic occupying the drums
Taking four MC's and make them sound like one

And together, we'll show you how to improvise
Reminicent of the Wild Style '75
Cause it's the brothers on the mic in the place to be
It's the J-U-R-A double S I-C
