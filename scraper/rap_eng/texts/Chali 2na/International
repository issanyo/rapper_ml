(Chali 2na)
Check it
Brace yourself consumer
The girls dem sugar and the fish named tuna
Combine to bring unity and intellect check the style
We extra
International

(Chorus)
Oh, listen to the music we are putting out
Ah, and everything is all right
And if you don't like the music we will throw ya out
We'll make ya dance all night
Feel the stuff that we are calling out
Listen to the flow come from above
Listen to the words that we are sending out(sending out)

(Chali 2na)
Put your hands up in the air like this
But quick, face to face
And embrace ya history
We got the recipe that erase the
Cause you'll be repping the south side of Chi-town till the death of ya(sucker)
We paper convey
It's safer to say
We crumble up ya crew like they was paper-mache
The vapour we spray
Make your vagas to delay
Power to get props we could take it away
Ya never catch me with the no lame girl home
Cause the fish voice is deeper than James Earl Jones
And the Beenie Man in the same world zone
Fire from the vampire as the game twirls on

(Chorus)
Oh, listen to the music we are calling out
Ah, and everything is all right
And if ya don't like the music I will throw ya out
We'll make ya dance all night
Feel the stuff that we are calling out
Listen to the call come from above
Listen to the birds that we are standing out(standing out)

(Beenie Man)

(Chali 2na)
We be the oasis
We show taste by making the whole place shift
We show faith to people with no patience
It don't make sense, it won't place with trouble
But, gracious
We never be play chess
Never love a girl without no latex
No doubt go safe sex
The nocturnal make it hot â€˜pon journal
Bout to explode like a popcorn kernel
So we clowns can make the ground shake
Our music attracts women thicker than pound cake
You brothers that sound fake you must check the style
We extra!
