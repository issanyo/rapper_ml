(Chorus)
Whose 2 blame
Who is the one who sparked the flame
The victim who became part of the game
We're being murdered for money sex and fame
The question remains the same
Whose 2 blame

My heart's torn as I watch my art form
Give plaques and charms to writers of wack poems
Divide and attack tryin'a collapse this platform
In this rap we're detached from any distractions
Yes
Settle the head of the evil music meant to divide and confuse kids
The media spoon feeds you
People who need you can see through your bluffin
Parasitic poison not fit for human consumption
While they focus on (…?...) crusades
The loss of human life is described as fragile loose eggs
Vatican they paid for they rollin' the slave trade
So how can you place blame on the hate that hate made
Secret political interests are confused
You police the planet but who protects us from you
While wars are waged over pathetic turf
We elect leaders with no regard for planet earth

(Chorus)
(…?...)credentials rollin' through my residential overpaid
People (…?...) the presidential motorcades
Rollin' single file like wheels on roller blades
They (…?...) but their welcome is overstayed
I quote a page on the grander scale
Cause the man who fails to plan really plans to fail
For real flows that flows and do stunts cause only once
The way to your ignorance can bury a man's
Sanity, can it be so simple
Today's medics is genetically cloned people
And they'll be headed pathetic
But while citizens give up they civil liberties
To officers of evil intent and devilish energies
While enemies join forces to endorse this
Mental extortion gone corporate
When will the culprit forfeit morbid acts on the helpless
Ignorant facts that they selfish aristocrats
Who flex well in the time when sex sells
The crime rhymes melt kids minds like soft snails
Either you end up in jail or court shells
But time lines help kids find they faults, well
For real
The media's how they got you attached
And violent image is permanent
Like yakuza and tattoos, they got yous
Relax they own the wheel
While adult messages traumatize the younger ear

(Chorus)
Rich rappers when you're talkin'
I hope you keep your topics as deep as your pockets
And use logic
The words kill before you have time to breath
What the ears hear and the eye sees the mind believes
While they hang you from your ankle and they take what falls
The citizens of this planet deserve a wake up call
He who hides knowledge controls this grand scheme
In the land of the blind the one eyed man is king

(Chorus)
Yo, now you know
And knowin's half the battle
