[Hook: Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda)]
From the top to the bottom
(Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten
(In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety
(The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me

[Verse 1: Mike Shinoda]
We're stuck in a place so dark, you can hardly see
A manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
And duck away into the darkness, times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut
So tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

[Hook: Chester Bennington (Mike Shinoda)]
From the top to the bottom
(Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten
(In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety
(The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care?

[Bridge: Chester Bennington (distorted)]
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[Verse 2: Mike Shinoda]
Listen to the sound, dizzy from the ups and downs
And nauseated by the polluted rot that's all around
Watching the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows, captures the eye
And cries out yellow light as it passes me by
And a young, shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rock with antennas on top
Now, nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The sane lose, not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change, the block stays the same
And the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

[Hook: Chali 2Na (Mike Shinoda)]
From the top to the bottom
(Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten
(In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety
(The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me

[Verse 3: Chali 2Na]
I'm here at this podium talking, the ceremonial offerings
Dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring, what's happening?
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants, causing urban collapse
And bullets that scar souls with dark holes get more than your car stole
Some hearts be blacker than charcoal
For real, this society's deprivation depends
Not on our differences, but the separation within
No reparation is made, limited aid on minimum wage
Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague
On the forgotten

[Outro: Chester Bennington (distorted)]
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up
