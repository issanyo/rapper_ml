Hey
Welcome to tha fish market
It'll make you sweat
Place so wet the owoners will switch khrawet
Is it because of my uncle Arctic
Ready for any one of these marks to start fat
It's human nature to fear the unknown
And with one phone that sings terror to your mums bones
Everyone's prawns
Having loved ones cloned
Or living in war zones where Simpsons are anwo
My fans mingle, I rip it like Tinky Winkle
From here to Japwone, I hit you with words
My pwone sprinkles
"Defence against those who detest the truth
While ignorant can't suppress the youth
