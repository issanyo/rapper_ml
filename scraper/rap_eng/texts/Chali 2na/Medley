[Intro]
Yeah, let's go, come on, yeah
And you don't stop
Yes sir, hey
And you don't quit
From the front, the back
The side to side
And way out there like this
Check it

[Verse 1]
Till the fish touch the grave
You're in my BlackPlanet like Griff, Chuck, and Flav
We rip up the stage till it fuck the slade
When the 2na shoot the gift, put your fist up and wave
Precious, the rest of people fabric softener
Average listener and elaborate author
Permanent script written with a magic marker
Hand-picked but just a tad bit awkward when I talk the truth
Yeah, try not to be starstruck
I pave the way like a tar truck when the guitar plucks
Wizard of Oz but skills measured in yards plus
Exhibit bizarre luck delivered in large thrusts
They're more set to give y'all stress
The birds I bless will penetrate your kevlar vests
Turn a heart rate to homicide like Bernhard Goetz
Don't come test, so count on me like income tax

[Chorus]
I'm outspoken
Language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
My mouth muscle got you checking my slang
It's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I'm outspoken
Language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
My mouth muscle got you checking my slang
It's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I'm outspoken

[Verse 2]
I weather the storm like hurricane shutters
My nefarious pawns truly remain better
I change color like a Duraflame cover
When it burns, standing firm like polyurethane rubber
Like Danny Glover, I'm too old for this shit
My lethal weapon is capping the flows that fish bit
No matter the region or chosen district
I keep my flows cheaper than a frozen fish stick
Ballistic, checking your wristwatch in distress
I'm big stepping like sasquatch, the fish fresh
Bitch types on the mic you bench press
We rowdy while you cloudy like a Bobby Brown piss test
Cats be jel, wish me well
This you can tell, they waiting on the fish to fail
On a mission wishin' they could resist a spell
Interrupt my scene and I'll scream on you like... (you motherfucker!)

[Chorus]
I'm outspoken
Language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
My mouth muscle got you checking my slang
It's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I'm outspoken
Language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
My mouth muscle got you checking my slang
It's just a dialect that I select when I hang
I'm outspoken

[Interlude]
Ladies and gentlemen
Boys and girls
[?]
Brazil style
Listen, it goes...

[Verse 3]
(Comin' through today)
Welcome to Terrordome...
I'm your host the friendly neighborhood baritone
Vocals channel the spirits of old poets
But I don't drink, my glass never will hold Moet
Similar to Paul Laurence Dunbar
From the crew you thought was just all chorus and one star
I'm one-sixth of a clique that runs shit
While commercial counterparts are in constant conflict, I'm...

[Verse 4]
(Comin' through today)
A lot of details
Oh my body be scales
I'm from Ida B. Wells
People see me feelin' Good Times since like eleven
With a really deep militant mind like Michael Evans
Every posse recline, they watch me get applause
Forming reservoirs on your desert shores
Witnessing mental and verbal fitness friend
Tuna fish that descended from Lake Michigan

[Chorus]
(Coming thru today)
Competition listen
(You got work to do)
To the [?]
(Chali 2-N-A)
And when I bring it up
(Bringing it straight to you)
One time, yeah
(Coming thru today)
[?] beginning
([?])
[?] just spell your name
([?])
Live on the west, but I'm
(Coming straight from Chi')
