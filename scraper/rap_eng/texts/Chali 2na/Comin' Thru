[Intro]

[Verse 1]
(Comin' through today)
Welcome to Terrordome...
I'm your host the friendly neighborhood baritone
Vocals channel the spirits of old poets
I don't drink, my glass never will hold Moet
Similar to Paul Laurence Dunbar
From the crew you thought was just all chorus and one star
Now, I'm one-sixth of a clique that runs shit
While commercial counterparts are in constant conflict, I'm...

[Verse 2]
(Comin' through today)
A lot of details
Oh my body be scales
I'm from Ida B. Wells
People see me feelin' Good Times since like eleven
With a really deep militant mind like Michael Evans
Every posse recline watch me get applause
Forming reservoirs on your desert shores
You're witnessing mental and verbal fitness friend
Tuna fish that descended from Lake Michigan

[Chorus]
Coming thru today
Competition listen
You know what to do
Chali 2-N-A
Bringing it straight to you
Coming thru today
You can't pass it by
Chali 2-N-A
Coming straight from Chi'

[Verse 3]
All day when I say that
I'm much more than just some backpack crap
Intelligent rap act or militant black cat... I'm
Killin' venomous platinum plaque macks
But forever spittin' relevant facts and that's that
Ain't how you play the game
It's how the game plays you, way true
Cadence is wild style like phase two
Touring without rest and blessed
My skull's laced with titanium plates
That pass metal detections... yes
Instant vintage, deep in the trenches
Every sentence can leave speakers defenseless
Peeking through fences and speaking bleaker than Memphis
Piquing your interest with heat-seeking intentions

[Chorus]
Coming thru today
Competition listen
You know what to do
Chali 2-N-A
Bringing it straight to you
Coming thru today
You can't pass it by
Chali 2-N-A
Coming straight from Chi'

[Verse 4]
(Comin' through today)
I'm from the city where they
Buried Al Capone and house music was born
Robert Kelly performed and heavy styles was shown
I made hijra and settled miles from home
Coast to coast LA from Chicago
It's the apostle, spittin' his gritty gospel
The ghetto diplomat, apocalyptic rap
I'm gifted, comin' to grips with that fact

[Bridge]
You're learnin' while the turntable turnin'
People should know me more than for
Just the verbal Herman Munster, what?

[Chorus]
Coming thru today
Competition listen
You know what to do
Chali 2-N-A
Bringing it straight to you
Coming thru today
You can't pass it by
Chali 2-N-A
Coming straight from Chi'
