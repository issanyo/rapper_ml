[Chorus: Jurassic 5]
Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!)
Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!)

[Verse 1: Chali 2na, Akil & Marc 7]
Yo, seldom travelled by the multitude
The Devil's gavel has a couple fooled
My culture's screwed 'cause this word is misconstrued
Small countries exempt from food 'cause leader have different views
You choose, what meen the world to me is bein' free
Live and let live and just let it be (Let it be)
Love peace and harmony, one universal family
One God, one aim and one destiny
(Oh Yeah?) Imagine life without a choice at all
Given no hope without a voice at all
These be the problems that we face
I'm talkin' poverty in race
But no matter what the case we gotta

[Chorus]
Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!)
Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!)

[Verse 2: Soup, Chali 2na, Akil]
Yo, I'm the first candidate to hate
Had to beat on the drum to communicate
For what was to come to those who were hung
They would decapitate the tongue if you would mention the word (Freedom) got people screamin' free Mumia Jamal
But two out of three of ya'll will probably be at the mall
I'm heated wit ya'll, the defeated will fall
Uncomplete an unsolved when the word freedom's involved
Yo, my forefathers hung in trees to be free (Rest in peace)
Got rid of slavery but still kept the penitentiary
And now freedom got a shotgun and shells wit cha name
Release the hot ones and let freedom reign
I'm the former vote prisoner
Hollywood visitor
Dance for cats segregated on wax
My color got me handi-cap Amos and Andy
For the freedom they just won't hand me

[Chorus]
Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!)
Hold on to this feelin', Freedom (Freedom!)

[Outro: Marc 7]
(Hold On)
'Cause there's not a lot of time (To)
Your heart, body, soul and your mind (This)
They're so true and they been hurtin' so long (Feelin')
That's the reason why we named this song (Freedom)
(Hold On)
'Cause there's not a lot of time (To)
Your heart, body, soul and your mind (This)
They're so true and they been hurtin' so long (Feelin')
That's the reason why we named this song (Freedom)
