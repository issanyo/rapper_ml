[Intro]
Step your game up
Step your game up

[Verse 1]
Well it’s the late great fish again
From the great state underneath Lake Michigan
Keep us safe just in case cake’s missing
And I speak frigid anytime I think Jake’s listening
Okay first and foremost
Make my purse burst as I put thirst before jokes
Won’t feel the rumors, I try to ignore folks
Immature blokes whose whole cloaks a pure hoax
Shifty eyes, the fish be wise
Risky lies can lead you to a quick demise
Get your arms wrapped up like some twisty ties
Haters are sick from witnessing how quick we rise
Yup, my momma told me to resolve my picture [?]
Or everything around me will dissolve and dissipate
Yeah, never earning is a fast disaster
And foolish is the student who don’t surpass the master

[Hook]
The reason that you have to step your game up
Put in work, make them notice your rep then came up
More than feeble attempts to gain bucks
If you shooting for your dreams too low then aim up
Step your game up
Heavy push, make them know that your rep done came up
Try to build up your name, remain tough
Grind till your brain busts and step your game up

[Verse 2]
Keep it funky long as I can like imagine
Making each record that I do better than the last one
Inside the passion I try to make it happen
So I don’t have to wear a ski mask and blast guns
The first son will leave your area hurt
When I’m in America they raise the terror alert
Scary when I leave you bury your dirt
Caters of clarity is making sure your stereo work, very alert
Like that y’all, got you switching your choice
Should we hit you with a hook, you change the pitch in your voice
Intricate with every step, we make you slippery with moist
And my constituents will get to the point ripping the joint
But uh over the bass and the treble clef
Hot like we hit you in the face with the devil’s breath
But just in case that the level slips
Never fret, just pick up the pace like you never left

[Hook]
That's why you gotta just step your game up
Put in work, make them notice your rep then came up
More than feeble attempts to gain bucks
If you shooting for your dreams too low then aim up
Step your game up
Heavy push, make them know that your rep done came up
Try to build up your name, remain tough
Grind till your brain busts and step your game up

[Verse 3]
Yo clash [?] cause a black Columbine
Contract nullifying print stack dollar signs
Gotta push cause a lot of cats out of time
Holla back by the dime wanna black gotta grind
The day that this rap became a weapon
Is the day that I was told to adapt to gain acceptance
The poorest people make scratch by any method
If he desperate he can pull out the strap to send a message

[Hook]
That's why you gotta just step your game up
Put in work, make them notice your rep then came up
More than feeble attempts to gain bucks
If you shooting for your dreams too low then aim up
Step your game up
Heavy push, make them know that your rep done came up
Try to build up your name, remain tough
Grind till your brain busts and step your game up
