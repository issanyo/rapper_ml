[Hook: Choklate]

This ain't a game to me, and I, hope it ain't a game to you
We only got a little bit of time to do what we came to do
(Let us rock)
And if we get it by
(Yo it's non stop)
We'll keep the crowd rocking all nigh'
Throwin' it down, wearin' a crown
I don't understand why you playing around
This ain't a game to me
Yo catz (quit playing)

[Verse 1: Chali 2na]

Chali two (Naty)
In the building brick laying
I'm saying that we could rent yo dentals
With influential credentials over
Instrumentals with a pencil
The essentials from peg your mentals
My regu-tensil rhymes sharper than in-suit knives
That lyrically living suspenseful lives
Fabricating stories rappers that vent through lies
We centralize minds with every intent to strive
And synchronize the times and every event to shine
The tri has them twitching like back spasms
(Spitting the while)
Switching it back
They can't fathom the two from mid-west dissent
Fresh defend
Doing our best to represent the testament
I see more green when the hoods' high strung
And mostly for the bullshit that could die young
So for your brain keep it simple on the plain
This ain't a-

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Supernatural]
You, best prepare cause we taking an dare
Yo cats are playing games but you ain't playing fair
I sit and watch the videos, I rest in my lair
Most of them is thug fillers, killers, Willies, and players
Real rhyme sayers, they just a thing of the past
You might as well lay down with that snake in the grass
Walking round like a clown, with a tear in your mass
Somebody lied to you, yo that nigga is gas
Ya'll brothers is using yo the same cookie cutters
With the same bullshit flows that copy one another
We just two rhyme vets thats giving you bomb threats
If you think that is hussle we ain't flex the arms yet
Ya'll combar cats with the combar raps
You need to get your paws up and run some laps
And since you acting like torn I'mma give you two snaps
Don't forget my name, it's Mister Supernat

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Chali 2na and Supernatual]

I'm saying, name your price in the game of life
For real, minus the referees and umpires
The tightest the recipes would we spit gunfire
At vampires with fake hand shakes and fake smiles
Stake the snake
Killing these snakes with great styles
Things are no longer free, now they pay styles
Meanwhile, ya'll cats killing the game
I can really tell the difference cause they rhyming the same
Cats with funny hats and colorful names
Your lyrics is lame, right now I'm cracking the frame
Attacking the names
Stackin them at the back at the plane
Cause we uncloak the vibe and remote revivals
Musical notes to ride to promote survivals
Slide through
But challenges never hold up fair
When I spoke they broke down like fold-up chair
And if the cap fits, wear it, cause we don't care
