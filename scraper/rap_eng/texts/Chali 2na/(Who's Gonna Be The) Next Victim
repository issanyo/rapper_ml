Tuna my brother they don't understand, they just don't understand, I mean we dropped this tape superb and MC's still had the nerve
???? told the hunnies they was hype but wasn't his type and they still wasn't with it, but I think we can give 'em another chance
So what I want you to do is step behind this mic and show 'em why you're called The Victim Of A Brainstorm

(Verse 1)
The professor thinks globally
But acts locally
You're just a local who be trying to kick it vocally
But I hope you ??? thirst is ludicrous
Stop drinking my lyrics and save some for the tuna fish
I know you wish this was a charity function
But this ain't no luncheon
So stop munching you munchkin
Cause every line is mine
They ain't yours
And as I pause
Hold your applause
And listen to 2na first
As I go through my verse
I lyrically prove that I'm as deep as the universe
Rappers are the targets and this is how we pick them
*Hmmm, who's gonna be the next victim*

Yo, 2na, role manager Steff Money just stepped in the house, so you know you gotta give 'em a shout out
But remember, don't sleep on these rappers out here

(Verse 2)
What a sight to see, Uni-ty makes a tape
But deaths step, honey step, Money counts the paper
So escape the violence, cause he'll damage ya
I can't deny, I rely on my role manager
Steff on standby
In case hands fly
He causes heads to fly
So kiss your dreads good-bye
If you got some
Cause when Steff gets dumb
He'll burst ear drums
For those that don't hum
Along with us, the song was just a trend
Black, you voice will crack like Just a Friend
Scared speechless and what was funny was
You freak when you seen how large Steff Money was
Imma alert another
If Steff hurt another
He'll go to jail for pre-meditated murder, brother
And dirt'll cover the corners of your coffin
Life is like a train
You get off when you feel fast pain
It could be your last pain
As I reign and remain like a grass stain
Unrinsed
And it's been fun since
I get no nonense
Cause I got gun sense
Seems enough to cap ya trap shut
You'll need a snatch shot
To capture my rap spot
If not think with me
Video link with me
Imma let you know about your idiosyncrasies
Boy, you're lazy
Too damn passive
Loose with the same excuse the whole class gives
Your ass lives on last minute decisions
As a result you can't envision
Success, yes you're mentally sick, Jim
*Hmmm, who's gonna be the next victim*

Yeah, I like that 2na, but check this out, since the audience is listening, I think you should let 'em know a little bit about yourself
And while you're at take 'em on a trip through your thoughts

(Verse 3)
Perhaps we can continue this journey like Russell's rhapsody
Lyrics I bred are just threads in my tapestry
You might collapse if we continue the synapses see
Chali's policies have intoxicating quality
Like puffing buddha
So numb your ????
Lyrical liquid is released in a thin spray
Inflicting pain with the strength of Kunta Kinte
I may be thin but I burn like ????
I then say that buddha's not a bandit
Ideas equal cities and sess is the mass transit
Taking you on journeys beyond what you see and feel
Using metaphors as lyrical vehicles
To see that you'll get acquainted
Face it, it's slammin' ain't it?
Pictures I painted leave your brain contaminated
With dreams of gentle streams and lyrical trickle
Tenderonis are phonier than a plastic nickel
At the flick of a Bic trick elastic tickles
And I put you kosher like Vlasic pickles
I'm the stork in this
So go ahead, put a fork in this
This is my fantasy and I'm Mr. Roarke in this
Robert Bork I insist can kiss the Jimbrowski
*Hmmm, who's gonna be the next victim*

That's right, who's gonna be the next victim, we taking on all comers
The audience is listening to THX, a Lucasfilm production
