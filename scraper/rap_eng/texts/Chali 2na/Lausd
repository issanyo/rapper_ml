[Hook: Jurassic 5]
Yo, we are no superstars
Who wanna be large and forget who we are
Don't judge us by bank accounts and big cars
No matter how bright we shine we're far from being stars
Cause stars fall, and disintegrate before they hit the
Asphalt, they incinerate cause we came
Not to destroy the law but to fulfill
For those who appreciate those with skills
And fresh windmills, and graf that kills
What is a DJ without the scratch to build?
Without the elements, it's all irrelevant
Niggas love to Freestyle but hate to Fellowship

[Zaakir]
Yeah, taste the city's agenda, most of you outta town niggas
Get caught up and turn bitter, the city of bullshitters
Where hopes are blown, not even money for the phone
Now tell me what's the solution, how to get back home?

[Charli 2na]
Yo, don't get caught up in glamor and glitz and camera tricks
The Land of the Debt, before you come examine your set
Where drama collects and women use special effects
Where amateur stunts can make a nigga damage your fronts

[Akil]
Uh, the California Sunkist with a twist of limelight
Some set trip on the Sunset Strip
Belive the Hyde Boulevard nice, the glamorous life
Many searching for the fame but can't afford the price

[Marc 7even]
She would turn you out if you wasn't prepared
She would tell you the things you wanted to hear
She would blur your vision when it once was clear
This chick is full of tricks so approach with fear, cause

[Hook: Jurassic 5]
Yo, we are no superstars
Who wanna be large and forget who we are
Don't judge us by bank accounts and big cars
No matter how bright we shine we're far from being stars

[Zaakir]
You say you love LA, you say the weather is great
Plenty sun in your face, you like the cars with bass
You like the way we paperchase and the women that shake
In the land of earthquakes and high crime rates
A lot of people is fake, this is Hollywood
We shape the minds of kids in every hood
We make your past situation look good
The nights filled with Suge's and I wish you would

[Marc 7even]
Can dance with Alvin Ailey and Les Miserables
In this century city, you can walk on the stars
Sex, money, and murder, yeah it's all 4 to 5
Cause fame and passerby with the name immortalized

[Akil]
On the avenue of stars, many names are called
On the boulevard, known for leaving permanent scars
Many dreams get robbed, real movie macabre
Young heartthrobs get young heart sobs, cause

[Sample]
"Good evening ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to Hollywood, California!"

[Charli 2na]
The city of angel's wings represents people's hopes and dreams
And the evil that men do that live life close to kings
And boast supreme, fancy cars, coats, and cream
Material things provoke more folks to scheme
Whether you paid your cost, Cali green made you cough
The smog covers the city like a table cloth
Is it fame at fault? Entertainers labeled soft
The place where people come to lose their train of thought

[Zaakir]
Despite the claims of what LA is and what it ain't
The picture the city paints that overexaggerates
Within the circus, if you're filling this service purpose
Some feel it ain't worth it, the city that's got you nervous
And make you injure, and get up out of here nigga
Cause LA never considered for those that need baby sitters
This is the hot bed for singles and newlyweds
Some looking for better gigs or fiending to make it big
It's the only place where stars are born
And we are the only ones that can't be worn
Out, by any place regardless of the cost
Cause brothers with big dreams, sometimes they get LAUSD cause

[Hook: Jurassic 5]
Yo, we are no superstars
Who wanna be large and forget who we are
Don't judge us by bank accounts and big cars
No matter how bright we shine we're far from being stars
Cause stars fall, and disintegrate before they hit the
Asphalt, they incinerate cause we came
Not to destroy the law but to fulfill
For those who appreciate those with skills
And..., and...
What is a DJ without the (scratching)
Without the elements, it's all irrelevant
(I represent the real from the beginning to the end of it)
