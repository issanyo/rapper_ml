[Hook: Supernatural]

React on contact with Supernat'
We blow ya wig back, best believe that
He's back
You feelin' that revolutionary street rap
We dilate, activate, yo demonstrate
Supernat' and I'm ready to work it out
Dilated and we ready to work it out
J5 and we ready to work it out
2na Fish get on mic and work it out!

[Verse 1: Chali 2na]

Now let's sit back and inhale this nice tree
While warriors ricochet like Denzel and Ice-T
Come lyrically feisty
Embedded like lice be, flow nicely
Some women can truly entice me
But watch the quiet ones
No Glocks and fired guns
Bust shots with paragraphs that blocked entire lungs
Burn crops at marathons
Want stocks and barabonds
We rock on with Supernat'
We blowin' like Sarah Vaughan

[Verse 2: Akil]

My uzi weighs a ton like Fat Joe and Big Pun
Tommy Hilfiger made Tommy Boy a Tommy gun
Three hundred and fifty seven style deception
Pistol grip pumped, aimed in your direction
Armed and strapped and packed for the attack
For any situation and trip we blast it back
Driveby's, uh, walkups we give a fuck
I light it up off the back of a Uhaul truck!

[Verse 3: Iriscience]

Yo I preach over the S3000 computer
With Supernatural, Jurassic 5, and Joe Buddha
The type to rock, sign a autograph and spark a lot
But never feed the birds, leave 'em pecking in the parking lot
Dilated expand, worldwide, watch me land
Watch the ? in North Hollywood to Knottingham
It's me that makes you p-p-p-panic something frantic
Raka aka Iriscience and new planet

Supernat' and I'm ready to work it out
Dilated and we ready to work it out
J5 and we ready to work it out
Mark get on mic and work it out!

[Verse 4: Mark 7]

There's principalities involved in this
We dominatrix classical
Dilated, J5 and Supernatural
We bring the heat to ya heart
When we meet call me Mark
Ripping beats all apart
The L-A-U-K-N-Y, we fly, connection
Gets eternal like reflection
When you enter the session we traffic like an intersection
Different shades of complexion gon' be feeling this blessing

[Verse 5: Supernatural]

Feeling the blessing inside the session
Yo, it's classic, flow with Jurassic
MC's they get their ass kicked
Blast quick straight off the dome
When I throw it like Chali 2na putting it down, natural born poet
Akil, he's real with the skills, we start to build, Supercool ain't no fool, yeah, drum fills and tracks
Joe Buddha hooked it up you like that
When I hear a fat beat, break it down, can't fight that
Shed the light on Mark7 use the mic as a weapon
Uniting brothas, yeah MC's should stop guessing, start fessing
Yo brotha we keep it live
Kicking lyrics, yo with a universal vibe
