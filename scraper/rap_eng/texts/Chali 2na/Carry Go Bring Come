[Intro:]
Chali 2na alongside the world general
We don’t like informa none at all
Deli Rankin pan di bankin
Hear mi nuh, this is crazy

[Chorus 1:]
Hustla nuh like informa
Drug dealer nuh like informa
Cheater nuh like informa
Carry go bring come dem a informa [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Those who battle well and those who tattle tail [?]
Abakradabra well [?]
They want the rapper trail
Searching for secrets, that will sell
Anything to keep the tattle tail outta jail
Don’t let these camouflage drop a draws
And the drama that they cause damage [?]
And those who rattle end up exposing the catalog
End up missing giving [?]
Who let these kids in the banquet

[Chorus 2:]
Snitching to the feds call them pigs in the blacket
Carry go bring come mek we sell out the soul
When the time hot dem boy deh move cold
Let’s go!

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 2:]
When mi say informa I mean snitch
Di one dem weh rat out my business
Di one dem weh go to the feds
Di one dem weh waan see di righteous youth dead
Trust mi
Mas my brothers hollaing, masters orders [?]
Many become first class reporters
Dirt bag supporters [?]
Guns will burst fast if they unmask informers
Taking disguise like everyday halloween
White collar worker [?]
All these rappers catching felony charges
And start singing to sergeant [?]
They climb right on
And anything you do in the dark we shine light on
We keep it right on, never to spend one night long
In central booking they get to talking singing the right song
Like dem a friend but a me dem a pree
Say dem have your side but a friend wanna be
Life is not a game so [?]
Listen, who let these kids in the banquet

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
