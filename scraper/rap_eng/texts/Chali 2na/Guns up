Like that like that ya don't stop, check it
One mo' time for the people out there
It goes peace -- if you come to see me rebel
2na-fish'll come ready like I was edie brickell
I'm everlasting, never will my head expand
This publisher is clearinghouse like I'm ed mcmahon
I getcha -- open like a bullet wound, test the repoitoire
And I'll connect a right cross to your upper jaw
I'm on my toes, all my foes beware
Cause 2na-fish'll tackle flows like I'm rosie grier, yeah
Forgot to tell you the response is choice
Comin to smother the brother with the monster voice
It's gonna -- wipe slow specimen I got the hype
So listen in lyrical nitro-glycerin
We pack a punch like a earthquake set
Comin through your {f***in} tapedeck is how we shake {s***}
So all you {b****-ass} brothers take shelter
Or you'll be on my conveyor belt when I melt ya
It's like that, one two for j-5
Let me tell you that we, make it live, gray-la-hey
Breathin in and out lung style, huh
Mr. canibus, won'tcha funk it up for a while
