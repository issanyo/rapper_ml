At times, I don't think you believe in me
So I came here to say I'm more than what you think of me as
Not to grieve over dissipating thievery
I'm here to change the scenery; do more than what I did in the past
Not the best-to-date, but don't underestimate
Where you stand could be your final resting place; dead in the grass
So take advantage of the days that you planned to do
The things that you wanted; if you don't then get ready to crash
Better to try and fail than to stand still
This could make a man feel useless in the eyes of a few
Never mind what the next man thinks
'Cause he just can't seem to separate what's a lie from what's true
And who you trying to please anyway
I hope it ain't the man, 'cause he just as imperfect as you
I reckon ain't nothing worse than walking this earth
Without a purpose or a clue of what you put here to do

All things considered
I'm trying to be a bigger man instead of being bitter
I'm trying to see a better plan instead of seeing glitter
I'm trying to be a better man and never be a quitter
I reckon I can


Go hard or go home is the motto
So I push full throttle making sure they never leave me behind
Pay attention to the things people follow
'Cause it seems people swallow all the gimmicks that are keeping them blind
For those that don't read, the truth is in the book
All you gotta do is look; if you seek then you find
The stronger that you mentally become, the more you benefit
That's why they want to keep you weak in the mind
Certain shit will go wrong; things happen that's all
The real trick is if you try to learn from your mistakes
The pursuit the of glitter can make your friends turn bitter
The next thing you know some of your closest fellas is snakes
I try to find my own fault first
Strictly to see if my opponent does have a relevant case
It's harder to admit when you're wrong
I reckon my whole life is as long as it takes to get it right
