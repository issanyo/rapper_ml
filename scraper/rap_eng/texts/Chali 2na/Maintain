[Pre-Chorus:]
Maintain my sanity
Want more humanity, uplift my family
Stay away from vanity
Maintain

[Chorus:]
Maintain
Maintain my sanity
Uplift family
Want more humanity
Stay away from vanity

[Verse 1:]
Sober moments few an far between from it all
Me an self keep it balance so you know we never falling for that drama
Stay smoking that keesh show you peeps
Show them lessons run deep
Insomnia never sleeping, marijuana
Top dollar supreme, hit a karma
Keep it cool through the summer
One wish,  praying my armor's untarnished
I wiz em with them skills that I harness
Gets out with the hell, one stab
Nigga, I promise, honest shinin a Koran in my hand
Knowing deep down that's the only truth that can cure us
Indeed, to each his own
My speech from a different zone
Pledge my allegiance to the most high, leave it alone
And gettin back to them lessons at hand
My man showed me how to flip it, then flip it again
I hit the block, i mean the booth, start spitting these grams
I'm tryna eat you to this knowledge
My ninja, get with the program

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Never will I fall into that ugly clone sound
Or that gangsta boogie shit that truly toned down
Stood above the whole crowd
With the buggy post out
Unapologetic, i'mma try to set it zoned out
With that evangelical, pre-mandelic flow
Manphibian, transcendent with an angelic glow
Thee-aredical let that be a medical
Three hands present so that he can't let it go
He  about to leave the premises soon, a visit from the vet
Calling the benefit, I'm tall as a minaret
And from the stage I got perspective like a bird's vision
Heard rhythm, precision, beats, but the words missing
The words sifting, i'mma take you nerds fishing
Burn piffing, if you heard different Jack Spade
Your neighborhood baritone will never compare with clones
Step into my battle zone and you'll get embarrassed homes

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
As I let my thoughts sink in the fabric of the page
I've been trying to find light through the labyrinth of a maze
Spent many cold nights really dealing with the pain
Cause this so-called life isn't really what it seems
My misfortune gave fuel for me to dream
In a world full of angels scarred, with broken wings
Prepare for the ending, pray, get on your knees
If you looking for forgiveness ask, and you'll receive
You see, I hold a tasteful advantage on the base of the planet
In a race with the savages
It only takes time to depict every word
And my senses say you know, that's the way it is
You gotta thank God that you living in this world
Your position that ain't safe for your unborn kids
This goes out to my family and friends and the life that I live
God forgive my sins

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
