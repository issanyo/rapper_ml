[Chorus]
I ain't got a place round here
No one knows my face round here
I've only got my word to spread
And a place to rest my head

[Verse 1]
Even though I'm type major
At times I might waver
Sweet as a life saver
But sharp as a knife razor
I engage the crowd when I'm dropping my style off
But you can't accuse till you walking a mile in my shoes
Stressful attempts to be successful
When haters for no reason detest you is the best fuel
One of the best few special vessels of the rest you
'Cause a wise man knows he's the best fool

[Chorus]
I ain't got a place round here
No one knows my face round here
I've only got my word to spread
And a place to rest my head
I ain't got a place round here
No one knows my face round here
I've only got my word to spread
And a place to rest my head

[Verse 2]
As I let my mind walk in the massive press thoughts
Traditional medicinal sentences, fresh quotes
And facts brought to back block against the trash talk
Blast off when my 10 toes touch the asphalt
Fast walk through the forest of flash floss and gloss
Transparent like I smashed my forks and glass vaults
Wear my camouflage presence help me camera dodge
And focus to 2na tryna unify the separatist
Ma weapon is to market my art poetic architect
Tryna keep my heart fresh before I start my trek
Life is heartless and hard pressed in dark depths
You'll meet hardships if you don't take smart steps forward
And when the smoke clears and you uncloak fear
You'll hear the sound of success in both ears
'Cause when there's no cheers in times provoke tears
You gonna switch your gears and push till shit's clear yes sir

[Chorus]
I ain't got a place round here
No one knows my face round here
I only got my word to spread
And a place to rest my head
And I ain't got a place round here
No one knows my face round here
I only got my word to spread
And a place to rest my head (yes sir)

(yes sir)

I ain't got a place round here
No one knows my face round here
I only got my word to spread
And a place to rest my head (yes sir)
And I ain't got a place round here
No one knows my face round here
I only got my word to spread
And a place to rest my head
