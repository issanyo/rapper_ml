[Verse 1]
The night we leave I gotta travel to Havana
And land at Guantanamo with Tony Montana
Surrounded by sun tan in Spanish grammar
Beautiful images are captured within the camera
Wayne put the ozone band to understand the inner workings of the culture
Cause I'm a fan plus
A chance to learn a my craft from a master
Perfect opportunity, what more could you ask for?
We walked across the Tijuana border, then move from Tijuana
To the Mona Rae shore. Or should i say the airport
Got to Atlanta and they never stamped my passport
A lucky man, huh? Clear customs, a weird bus comes
Sacks players sick from drinking plenty beers
Bust em on the plane, I'm thinking we dun came a lifetime away
I'm might fuck around and find my future wife while I play area

[Chorus]
Beautiful Cuban woman
After we play all day
Come to my private party
Pass the night away
Lovely Havana woman
After we play all day
Come to my private party
Pass the night away

[Verse 2]
More than I could imagine or fathom on this tropical island
The magic, I had fun I wish I could sit in, like
Time stopped, a detective from the 50's, felt like a rewind clock
But this was the world, we bounce spot
Where African [?]  make the music sound hot
Found ourselves at the party, where promoters let us play
And the Cuban women were everywhere, all day
One sister in particular was the one I was checking for
Standing by the side of the stage, close to the exit door
I had to catch her before her and her friend left
Infatuated the [?] to be a princess
Caught my interest, I like the way she walked inside her thin dress
So my eyes followed. One problem, I probly couldn't manage
I couldn't speak Spanish
This is what i wanted to say

[Chorus]
Beautiful Cuban woman
After we play all day
Come to my private party
Pass the night away
Lovely Havana woman
After we play all day
Come to my private party
Pass the night away

[Verse 3]
I can't speak Spanish. Then she came and spoke to me
And said something that I couldn't understand truly
My homie in the band was a Mexican descendant
Told me that he knew exactly what she meant
She said, can you make love as good as you can rap
I smiled at her, my face said yep
But can I get to know you better?
My homie told her in Spanish
She said it's cool, she was down for whatever
So she grabbed my hand and we walked out the door
My homie tagged along, just a translate some more
We got up after eating just to make the night complete
She promised to cook me breakfast if I liked what she had in store
So we went back to her place
The room in the back is her space
Assuming my mack can get me pass first base
I was more than attracted to her face, in the first place
She was

[Chorus]
Beautiful Cuban woman
After we play all day
Come to my private party
Pass the night away
Lovely Havana woman
After we play all day
Come to my private party
Pass the night away
