[Hook]
From genesis to exodus
From homelessness to extra plush
From Flesh to dust
These unexplained intense secrets, is it a form of control or coincidence

[Verse 1]
The war is on, i saw a fire in the storm
Shaytan got his arms and picking people for bonds
Putting people at harm, they killing and stealing alms
Prison is like another simile for a farm

Goin' on...

Bombs burst and blast beyond heat
Leave crowded streets encased in concrete
Innocent lives taken, the taste in non sweet
Despite this handshaking is peace beyond reach?

They went from helium flights to meteorites
Who's the most watched on T.V. tonight?
They feeding you like a baby needing pedialyte
Leading you right to believing you believe n' you right

Is it coincidence that some claim to be warriors?
Cos shady characters motives are ulterior
Silly cos you believe that they down to earth but they fake really
Tucked in the dirt like a snake deli

Get ready

And if you willin' and able
Connect your mind power like some jumper cables

Filthier than dirt in your navel they try and disable
Telling you fibs and fables and attempt to betray you

But I... keep stepping, dipping, moving and dodging
And im never surprised when opposition arises
It's critical ??? can't stop the progress
Controlled coincidence? its fate that knows best


[Hook] x2

No matter, right or wrong, it's still going on
No matter, right or wrong, it's still going on

[Verse 2]
The war is on provoked by global fascists
While here at home they harass lower classes
Smashes using tear gas to clash with the masses
Officers rolling quick with whips and moustaches

Pac got got and Biggie got Shot. Coincidence or not
When's this shit gon' stop
My momma told me to count the ones I got
Just look at how far me and 2na have got

We're telling there's compromise of an artists soul
And this compromise is another form of control
It's the opposite of sprite cos at first the scene shifts
Your image is everything and your thirst don't mean shit

Thats it, the ins and outs
Definites and doubts, how's, who's and abouts
Coincidence you hearin' these word from out my mouth
Got your head moving and shaking, bouncing about

Dousing the drought, cos this countries consciousness
Is controlled the word free does not exist

Atleast who exists?, one fist for pure consciousness
Where people live in a rhythm of bliss

But since, time is ending and space is endless
One minute celebrity and the next you straight friendless
All you have is a heart and a song
And controlled coincidence is what keeps this whole shit goin on

[Hook] x2

No matter, right or wrong, it's still going on
No matter, right or wrong, it's still going on
