Woven words over beats big, gallantly
I try to blend talent with the beast mentality
Distinct imagery just increase salary
You're weezing, you swell up like a bee-sting allergy
Out in the street, fuck the police, scream violently
Corruption run rampant while they keep things silently
Hidden behind red tape
You guys big-wheelin'?
I'd rather be a dead ape
Than a live pig squeelin'
To authorities to the courts with these poetries
Controllers of currencies
They neglected to show us these
And technology is killing us slowly (I need someone to show me)
He who controls the media controls the flow of things
Now they controlling the weather making it snow and rain
They telling me global warming's a fantasy but (I need someone to show me)
I lay wires, abolishing slave driver
Mentalities with a different reality, way brighter
But what's the remedy for hatred and bigotry? (I need someone to show me)
We were taught to never question when there's fear
But there's a quest to rule the western hemisphere
To make a democratic planet easier for them to steer
Screaming save the world but they're not interested in its care
It's, world domination, through war confrontation
Foreign soil occupation for oil confiscation
Politicians make the climate hot as satan
With their not so modest statements and their actions thought as blatant
Attempts to be supporters of war and turmoil
Trying to keep the world's will and continue to burn oil
While the real double deals that happen are low key. (I need someone to show me)
I puff a pound of piff and demolish the counterfeit
Wake up the sound of sleep with a force of a thousand fists
Cause' you can't see it don't mean that it don't exist. (I need someone to show me)
From ancient pyramid rock to picking thin cotton
They been plotting from your born until your skin rottin'
They told the world they killed Osama Bin Laden but (I need someone to show me)
Listen, if your mission is forced
It can only take a second until you're switching your course
Next second your checking and your direction is lost
So your vessel is stationary at the fisherman's wharf, get on course
Have patience you can wait until the paint dry
Some of yall so high that you can faint and you can't fly
I'm looking for the reasons why and I can't (I need someone to show me)
You got familiar fates and you got phenomenon
That unexplained shit that folks don't like to comment on
Assumptions and speculation's when the dramas born
Facts missing like cats cooking pork on Ramadan
Lives wasted like the cumberbund when the thunder comes
Yet they tell us the pursuit of freedom is number one
Did the innocent in Guantanamo go free? (I need someone to show me)
Secret information leaks, government covered it poorly
While the media only giving you some of the story
Listen, you gotta treat me like I come from Missouri cause (I need someone to show me)
Actors and actresses play political activists
And their deceptive practices stir shit up like a laxtive
It ain't attractive some people had to go back and live (I need someone to show me)
Some people clearly live in a state of delirium
And never move as much as the dirt it takes to bury em'
You're just a bubble in this universal aquarium. (I need someone to show me)
Yeah, well lets go
