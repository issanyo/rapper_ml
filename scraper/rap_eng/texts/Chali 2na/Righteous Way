The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told him so
The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told him so

[Verse 1]
Through fights with mom
And long nights you're gone
Through all types of wrong
I love my pops
Through penitentiary
Drug addiction and misery
You defeated the enemy
I love my pops
Twenty some odd years
Wiping my little sister's tears
She missed dad, but where was my pops?
Too proud to tell us he was running from his demons
And we're thinking that nothing could ever budge my pops
But I used to wonder
What put my moms under
My pops and kept 'em together for seventeen summers
I reminisce in my mind
Me and my pops would find
The time we spent it never seemed funner
But I remember the day that he left
Him and my mama they never nurtured their relationship
And it went from Bonnie and Clyde
To problems with money and pride
Together they couldn't decide

The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told him so
The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told him so

[Verse 2]
Through parental separation
And miscommunication
I love my mama more than I love myself
Along with grandmamma they played my two parents
So you know I love them more than I love myself
In and out of prison for stealing
Illegally making a living
But she taught me how to love myself
Pops wasn't there to teach me 'bout the man inside
I had to learn who he was myself
I was the man of the house
So my younger siblings looked up to me as the father that they never had
Resentful of the fact
My sister would talk smack
And call him sperm donor, but never call him dad
It's sad I know it gets lonely for my only brother
Cause him and his father never really got to know each other
And those days I vowed for sure
If I ever had a child I would choose

The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told him so
The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told him so

[Verse 3]
I became a parent at the age of twenty-one
With no doubts or questions
Cause I love my son
I fell for a woman same name as my mama
Maintained heavy drama
But I love my son
Eleven years of love, lies and fears
Closed our eyes and ears
But because my son
Had nothing to do with the reason we would fight for days
We kept it together to raise my son
In the beginning we would ditch school to see each other
She quit school and ran away so we could be together
Before I got paid for working my tongue
The greatest moment that we shared was the birth of our son
Another eight years passed 'til the day that I left
And why's that? We never nurtured our relationship
And it went bust and die
Cause of problems with trust and pride
Together we couldn't decide

The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told him so
The righteous way to go
Little one would know
Or believe if I told him so
