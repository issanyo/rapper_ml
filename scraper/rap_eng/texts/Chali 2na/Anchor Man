[Intro]
Yes yes
Testing, one two
Chali 2na, J5
Dan The Automator, check it out, yo

[Chorus]
But that ain't all I am
But that ain't all I am
But that ain't all I am
But that ain't all I am

[Verse 1]
Ballistic linguistics, don't miss this fact
I got the present covered like some Christmas wrap
Trying to avoid the drag [?] and official's plaque
When lookin' into the abyss, the abyss looks back
Any time you shine we can eclipse this act
And shrink your ego to the size of a lipstick pack
Distant from he who says he's best and it's just whack
I skip this track like CD's when your disc gets strathed
Restless acts of freshness, invest this track
Blessed with natural grace, plus the place is packed
Takin' it back to basic to make it stack
Embrace cats, but evasively you fakes get snatched
The greatest still come in thetas, keep the pace intact
Protection from deception, people hated the fact
You at the face of the mountain, I'm at the apex jack
Freaky man, [?], AKA A-Track

[Chorus]
It's like that, I'm a man, but that ain't all I am
I'm a member of a band, but that ain't all I am
Entertainer and a fan, but that ain't all I am
Yeah, I hold it down, c'mon
I'm a man, but that ain't all I am
I'm a member of a band, but that ain't all I am
Entertainer and a fan, but that ain't all I am
Yeah, I'm the anchor man, yo

[Verse 2]
The mask comes off, I'm hotter than tabasco sauce
You try to flatter than the lawn that the grass grow 'cross
And you can laugh but your stash shows loss
Financial crash, no --- in your ----, go floss
What comes forth from your mouth is purely ----
No talk, and if I wanna know your habits I'll harass your boss
This ain't the path to cross, I keep it tighter than a lasso toss
And I ride like the great David Hasselhoff
If you wanna wrestle with us sound class with us, it cost
Competitors will never last with us, you lost
Before you began, taking it past the gloss
Make ---- expose my talent and mask my faults
The astronaut make your class get hot
And hold fast to my spot 'til my ---- drop
While the plastic plots, I'm sort of mass assault
The anchor man will bring the plans to a drastic halt

[Chorus]
It's like that, I'm a man, but that ain't all I am
I'm a member of a band, but that ain't all I am
Entertainer and a fan, but that ain't all I am
Yeah, I hold it down, c'mon, yeah
I'm a man, but that ain't all I am
I'm a member of a band, but that ain't all I am
Entertainer and a fan, but that ain't all I am
Yeah, I'm the anchor man, check it out, yo

[Verse 3]
Ayy, the prime minister, back to finish my business up
Your whole unit, your generals and lieutenants ----
You got skipped the minute it got invented, trust
Your minutes up, forget it, you can't diminish us
Independent businessman, in it to win it, plus
My dark penmanship sparks images when it's touched
Rippin' up in this plush, my sentences give it push
Exceeds limits that set up by any business books
Sharp as the feel of surgical steel when it cuts
Even the healthiest flesh will stretch 'til it's dust
Claim you the realest, I never feel it much
I've travelled the planet with all people but I'm still in touch

[Chorus]
Now I'm a man, but that ain't all I am
I'm a member of a band, but that ain't all I am
Entertainer and a fan, but that ain't all I am
Yeah, I hold it down, yes man, huh
I'm a man, but that ain't all I am
I'm a member of a band, but that ain't all I am
Entertainer and a fan, but that ain't all I am
Yeah, I'm the anchor man, check it out, yo
