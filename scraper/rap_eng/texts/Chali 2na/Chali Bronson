Chali Bronson
Coming straight out the dungeon
A verbal conundrum walks among and fill up your lungs, ganja punching
Contra-consumption plus something I came to slam funk on you punks who rambunctious
The grand punk fish 6 yo dinosaur
Connoisseur carnivore that devours amateurs
Past parameters damages what I'm sent for
Sound like you got your rhymes from a 99 cent store
The definition of piss poor
We invent pure scripts sure to prevent war
Resist a kick like a Kalashnikov you tin foil your sins foil you ain't loyal
While you pretend to be your tendencies tend to be dirty energy ya’ll prefer to be finicky
Easily scored all you wheezly frauds that spell temper like the letters on a Ouija board

[Chorus]
We keep on
I keeps it bouncing
When the PR’s wanna wish for death I’m C. Bronson
Strapped and wrapped holding my Johnson
Vigilantly walking the street like Charles Bronson
We gon’ keep it bouncing
When the PR’s wanna wish for death I’m C. Bronson
That's when I step in as an option when
You need a breath of fresh oxygen
Chali Bronson

Okay I’m waiting
Never displacing and slay kings from Texas to Beijing
Amazing,  exceed those who day dream
With they skin they flake like pencil shavings – Yeah
Can't interject pimp flow with the incorrect info and your intellect been slow
I'm hood ready good buddy, that's a ten four
Got that widdle peak baby throw Eddie Winslow
Victimless crime when I spit on this rhyme
Shit, you'd think I'm pistol whipping a blind kid
My time period makes me official with my script
And we make you crack like Jigga rapping with dry lips
So stop thinking that my fire's tame
I roll thicker than the locks on a lion's mane
I'm here to form an alliance and apply this claim
To make sure Big and Pac didn’t die in vain
Now lets go

[Chorus]

Yeah look how my peers cower
Switch gears and BOOK
We got all of 'em shook, they know that there’s power
From the land of the Sears Tower
Beware of our skill set, they will shut down you and your friend’s drama
I’m an insomniac-- you're narcoleptic
Don’t provoke when I spark the method
A sharp investment
My past perfected while your water shark infested
I’m a contraceptive cause I’m hard to F with
My talk is selected
And yes I…

[Chorus]
