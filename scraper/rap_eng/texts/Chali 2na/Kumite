[Chorus: Ayla Nereo]

Tails flip, time slips
Restoring the balance
Seems ya bend the frame, see where your dreams wanna meet you
Face to face into the give way into
Time, slip, plans tip
Reworking the shape of it
Seems you sew yourself in surrender
Can you turn your eye to eye, what you see there?


[Verse 1: Mr. Lif]

This is not about the death of your physical form
Nor is this just another spiritual song
It's about being present without clinging to the now
Accepting changes without clinging to the how
Fluidity, rigidity, on opposite poles
Divided by the rat race and all of our goals
The long quest for balance in a world that's off kilter
Stress'll kill ya so it's best just to filter
The madness out, the quest for status out
Silence your mind, try and take a look at your route
How does that path look? Has it been true to your core?
If not the other shoe drop, it might get raw
The quest for sanctuary often riddled with setbacks
Close calls and moments that you'd like to get back
But let the reins go, realize life flows
If you're following your heart, you're gonna like where you go


[Chorus: Ayla Nereo]

Tails flip, time slips
Restoring the balance
Seems ya bend the frame, see where your dreams wanna meet you
Face to face into the give way into
Time, slip, plans tip
Reworking the shape of it
Seems you sew yourself in surrender
Can you turn your eye to eye, what you see there?


[Verse 2: Chali 2na]

Transform, my plan of attack is hands on
We adapt, never land on my back, I'm in grand form
We stand strong, pushing forth with this metamorphosis
Pharaohs and sorcerers tortured us but couldn't force us to quit
Enforcing the gift given, herbals help the sense
Metaphor martial art, verbal self defense
I'm Bruce Lee with the claw shaped scars
And crews flee when my flow take charge, we hate frauds
Telegraph, never humorous, it's the paragraph pugilist
They call Tuna Fish, my accolades are numerous
You and your crew are a consumer risk
Kumite, Tuna stay super, team up with Mr. Lif
Not here to dispatch fists, we match wits
With verbal tactics that could crack bricks, we back bitch
Scratching your back itch with classics
When rap switched to darkness, we kept our match lit


[Chorus: Ayla Nereo]

Tails flip, time slips
Restoring the balance
Seems ya bend the frame, see where your dreams wanna meet you
Face to face into the give way into
Time, slip, plans tip
Reworking the shape of it
Seems you sew yourself in surrender
Can you turn your eye to eye, what you see there?


[Verse 3: Ayla Nereo]

We're detached from the center from the moment we arrive
We strive and strain steps to the desk to the drive
And old this is it, work hard, buy shit
It holds us in, tight rope and tightening
Yet truth - built into our bones, cells and souls
Not a far off thing but takes some
Listening, let it go, choice and a dare
To nod to the beauty of the duty you find there
What you find there
What you find there
What you find, what you find


[Bridge: Chali 2na & Mr. Lif]

You really shouldn't dwell on what we will or won't say
You've entered the verbal Kumite, say Matae
Surrender your shell, turn to spiritual form
Nothing lasts forever yo, we all transform
You really shouldn't dwell on what we will or won't say
You've entered the verbal Kumite, say Matae
Surrender your shell, turn to spiritual form
Nothing lasts forever yo, we all transform


[Outro: Ayla Nereo]

Truth - built into our bones, cells and souls
Not a far off thing but takes some
Listening, let it go, choice and a dare
To nod to the beauty of the duty you find there
