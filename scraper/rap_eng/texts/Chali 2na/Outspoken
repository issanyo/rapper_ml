[Intro]
Yes, yes
Testing
Let's go
And you don't stop
Yes sir
And you don't quit
From the front to the back
And the side to the side
It goes a little something like this

[Verse 1]
Till the fish touch the grave
You're in my BlackPlanet like Griff, Chuck, and Flav
We rip up the stage till it fuck the slade
When the 2na shoot the gift, put your fist up and wave
They drag you off, it's softer than fabric softener
Till the average listener and elaborate author
Permanent script written with a magic marker
Hand-picked but just a tad bit awkward when I talk the truth
Listen, try not to be starstruck
I pave the way like a tar truck when the guitar plucks
Wizard of Oz but skills measured in yards plus
Exhibit bizarre luck delivered in large thrusts
They're more set to give y'all stress, the birds I bless
Will penetrate your kevlar vests
Turn a heart rate to homicide like Bernhard Goetz
Don't come test, don't count on me like income tax

[Hook]
I'm outspoken
Language is broken into a slang
But it's just a dialect that I select when I hang
My mouth muscle got you checking my slang
It's just a dialect that I select when I hang

[Verse 2]
I weather the storm like hurricane shutters
And my nefarious pawns truly remain better
I change color like a Duraflame cover
When it burns, standing firm like polyurethane rubber
Like Danny Glover, I'm too old for this shit
My lethal weapon is capping the flows that fish bit
Shit, no matter the region or chosen district
I keep my flows cheaper than a frozen fish stick
Ballistic, checking your wristwatch in distress
I'm big stepping like sasquatch, the fish fresh
Bitch types on the mic you bench press
We rowdy while you cloudy like a Bobby Brown piss test
Cats be jel, wish me well
But this you can tell, they waiting for the fish to fail
On a mission wishin' they could resist a spell
Interrupt my scene and I'll scream on you like Christian Bale

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's typical, with lyrics, I'm pimping like Jack Tripper clothes
And the spliff I roll is thick as a stripper pole
Win an Olympic gold, we're black as a brick of coal
I'm off the hook while you're crooked like Scottie Pippen's nose
Intricate lyrics but gifted with a terrific flow
Heard the competitors working it with the perfect show
Don't take it personal, when we break out the arsenal
It's impossible to defend it, look what you got into
Disperse fat raps in dirt nap cats
From back when folks got drugged or your purse got snatched
Back when Grand Wizard's mom's records first got scratched
Or Grandmaster Caz's verse got jacked
We call it rapper's delight
Not here to treat no rapper polite
I'm committed to make you sweat like hot Africa nights
And make the party hectic like domestic passenger flights
We keep it classic through the passage of life
But tonight

[Hook]
