[Hook]
It ain't my fault
If you don't like beats and basses, colorful faces, [?]
It ain't my fault
If you don't like Krafty and Dyna, Chali the rhymer
Well I can't stop it
It ain't my fault
If you don't like constant scratches, fire and matches well
It ain't my fault
But if you love flows that are golden, [?]
Better check this
It ain't my fault

[Verse 1]
Two of the worlds most dangerous MC's raining debris heat
Burning like there was flame in the trees
We came in the breeze, spreading like a contagious disease
Famous, receiving nameless degrees my aim is to please
But typically you got some big cats and possibly [?]
While my collection is the shit like the colostomy bag
We at the bottom of the barrel, means a lot to these crabs
Cookin' a pot of animosity [?]
It ain't my fault
That you got vertical view from the ground floor
I reppin' a pair of small shoes at the clown store
Flow, down pour in a profound war
I'm a beast, if you're looking for peace you found war
So keep course [?] no heat source
Make your whole fleet turn and retreat north from deep thought
Non-stop that's how you fill this onslaught
I'm not the reason [?]
You see it ain't my fault

[Hook]
If you don't like beats and basses, colorful faces, [?]
It ain't my fault
If you don't like Krafty and Dyna, Chali the rhymer
Well I can't stop it
It ain't my fault
If you don't like constant scratches, fire and matches well
It ain't my fault
But if you love flows that are golden, [?]
Better check this
It ain't my fault

[Verse 2]
Wait, wait let it be known
There a few that are iller and handle the microphone
This is golden. You might want to put on your vest
I put a line and define and divided the rest
I am privileged to have moved to [?]
Grew with the tribe and roam the slum villages
This is the gem you should keep in the vault
And if you don't like the style then well
It ain't my fault
High score, real top ranking, ting-a-ling-a-ling
Old school Shabba Rank-ing
It's good times for your favorite era
Gucci on the shades make the party look clearer
If I can't hear ya, you should shout louder
Trailer's so white like I'm [?] clam chowder
This is the gem you should keep in the vaults
And if you don't like the style then well

[Hook]
It ain't my fault
If you don't like beats and basses, colorful faces, [?]
It ain't my fault
If you don't like Krafty and Dyna, Chali the rhymer
Well I can't stop it
It ain't my fault
If you don't like constant scratches, fire and matches well
It ain't my fault
But if you love flows that are golden, [?]
Better check this
It ain't my fault

[Verse 3]
Your paragraphs feel improperly dressed
While my philosophy's unstoppably fresh
And I am not to be messed with
Step quick and drop to your depth
Unless your possession like apostrophe 's'
And you're impossibly stressed out
Of course you act a disappointed singer
But your course of action is to point the finger
Instead of taking responsibility for your non-stability
Your hostility's a dead ringer
But it ain't my fault (yeah)
Check it, check it while we direct it
Seasoning on our names so [?] then respect it
Evening out the flames of fire starters and lion [?]
Raise it higher than kick-starters and big [?]
Stay gracious, blinded when they hate us
Blinded when they rate us, yep they're bodacious
I keep it spacious, like the four seasons
And if you don't like that style
It ain't my fault
It ain't my fault
Constant scratch, scratch, scratch, scratches
Krafty and Dyna and Chali the rhymer, well I
Well I can't stop it
It ain't my fault
