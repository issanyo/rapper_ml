[Verse 1]
Hey, ain't got no mask on
Ain't trying to sing no fast song
Ain't trying to get a pill for my ecstasy
Your Viagra pill trying to make it last long
NASCAR, got it bad
Got a badge on like a very young Usher Raymond
Rush to gain, bring the pain, never clown
Then I bring it down just to test a layman
Tell the people how to spell my name and
Make sure they get it right
Chali number two, not a U but an N and an A
I never play cause I did it right
I'ma spit will and legitimate quick wit
Critics, admit it, my shit is tight
Some of y'all gon' run like a coward
But I'm gon' sit and fight

[Hook:]
(Stand up!)
For what you believe in this evening
We don't need no cowards, homie, we need men
No matter how it's told, hot or cold, day and night
Some of y'all gon' run like a coward but we gon' stay and fight
(Stand up!)
For what you believe in this evening
We don't need no cowards, homie, we need men
No matter how it's told, hot or cold, day and night
Some of y'all gon' run like a coward but we gon' stay and fight
(Stand up!)

[Verse 2]
We in your head, buster
Shout it, you the head buster
I'ma stay fit, verbally rich and shit
Don't exist like a jar of red mustard
Never trust you cats who bear custard
Walk with pride, but really soft inside
In front of your homies you talk live
But I come on the set, you get awfully quiet
I'ma take a walk and decide if I'ma let you off and slide
I'll let the awkward vibe you provide with your talk, put you in a coffin ride
I survive cause I breathe underwater, people call me Aquaman
Easy muscle with a little bit of greasy hustle like I own the taco stand
Treat a brother like a nacho, man
Everybody covered in melted cheese
When the lights out, hip-hop is so iced out
The wealthy MCs have helped it to freeze
Like a disease with no scruples
Indeed, like a school with no pupils
Never think I'm a fool, I'm trying to make sure the lawyers say
Contract cool with no loopholes
Ain't nobody here to touch you today
Put the nonsense and the bullshit away
Get a good grip on the day, you never stray
Up in the morn before dawn while I pray
I say, no matter how they done told ya
Hot or cold, day and night
Some of y'all gon' run like a coward but we gon' stay and fight

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey, the undisputed kings
Wonder what undiluted means
Don't choose this foolishness
When you move with coolish human beings
This ain't no movie scene
Cristal, Patr√≥n and curvy strippers
Got to swerve and honk to make the whole party bump just like dirty clippers
I'm not a dirt, I'm vicious, you're fictitious, I'm infectious
I'm coming with a soaker all-inclusive style, I'm calling it precious
Breaking it down in sections and flexing, now walking towards the light
Some of y'all gon' run like a coward but we hold form and fight

[Hook]
