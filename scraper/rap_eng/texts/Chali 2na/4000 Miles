Yo

[All]
We take a journey through music right now (*2X*)

Yo, when music temptations can't be resisted
Fifths will be inconsistent make me a misfit
Listed as a phenomenon I got an oncoming bomb
Which is perfection and flexin' like I spent time in Nam
The beat is on and its nice and easy
Instrumentals blendin' like cinnamon rice and peas
And life's a breeze when you don't have to kick it to find
Contemplate the creation with Blackalicious and I
Tuna fish is full of musical entities past gone
Tryin' to hold fast and grasp hits like last fall
So last long flash on keepin' the past strong
We grab songs and rhythm so people can catch on
Yes
My mic monicker, momma I twice promised her
Love life, if music is truly your wife honor her
Burnin' to your thermometer stretch a million kilometers
Connect a population of Earth to one another for real

[Hook]
Music, deliver from within and it covers up everything
Music, when the melody and rhythm get to moving and unity
Movin', one force one love one whole community
Do it, keep travelin' on keep travelin' on

[Gift of Gab]
Underground or overboard overlord oh my lord
More and more pure sonic overjoyed soarin' towards shores
Unseen, uncharted bout to get explored
Warriors breakin' all the limits twistin' the laws
Now who said that underground is only just one more
I'm sellin' time and space and matter, making hula-hoops of Saturn's rings
And bring my bing, in sync, to think
That these was meant to be writ and be spit, so ever be writ
We on some destiny (shh shhh) we just a piece of this
We offer testament of every cultural element
Ever sent to us by the ancestors as though we manifest as
Some new world pedestrians
Just lounging with some fishin' poles up on the moons crescent
Just tryin to make some history spittin' on a few records
I had a dream like Martin Luther King in adolescence
And now I'm out in Tokyo and Europe havin' sessions
The final destination used to be my main question
But then I looked and all that I was searchin' for was present
The final destination used to be my main question
But then I looked and all that I was searchin' for was present

And now I'm out and out on and on the road we play
Soundin' off like an army ho replay
Talkin' bout walkin' miles of roads he paved
Travel out droppin' bombs with no delay

[Overlaps with Hook]
And now I'm out and out on and on the road we play

[Lateef the Truthspeaker]
Now see we rock around the clock we don't stop for nothin'
Gonna take it to the top - non stop - no frontin'
People listen when it drops cause it speaks to something
In they souls when they all alone, spacing in the zone
Or walking they block - talking to they homey at the shop
See the point is this - even if the homey got shot
Then there still be the bump knockin' in your trunk
Get ya out your slump rockin' it straight off the top
Concotcin' it like ingredients thrown haphazardly inside a crockpot
With a magic sock, schnapps, a big ass book, and some vodka
And pass it my way cause I'm a real big talker
And I love new experiences I'm the godfather of gettin' into to trouble
On the road undercover shit - take your whole crowd if you leave em uncovered
And I believe even hammer would say my shit's proper work
Not to put a damper on the underground answer shit
You dealin' wit motherfuckers, done underground anthems, done
Rocked from the west coast damn near to Athens and you still hate a whack song as much as the next man
And still in love with the good one
We interact with listeners this is our contribution on the war against
The whiteness and slightness, a constitution of fatness
Blackalicious, Jurassic, Maroons, Latyrical madness
Your mind is captured with tactics to get you blasted the fastest
And you still wonder, baffled at just how long does this is lastin'?
We have the fashion to classic the pure love satisfaction
Is when the magic is captured and life actions made tangible with
