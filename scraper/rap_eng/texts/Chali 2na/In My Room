(In my room)

(In my room)

In my room
Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Each day is just like the next
Where I live
In the past
(I will die)

In my room
Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Each day is just like the next
Where I live
In the past

In my room
Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Baby how low can I go
All alone
In my room

(In my room)

(In my room)

In my room
Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Baby how low may I go
All alone
In my room

(I will die)

In my room
Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Each day is just like the next
Where I live
In the past
