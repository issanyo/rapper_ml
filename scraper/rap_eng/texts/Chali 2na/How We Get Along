Yeah, I'm maintaining with Jurassic 5
You know what I'm sayin'
My people's up in here, Biggie B, One Love

What we're about to do and show you is how we get along
We get along with eye contact
We also get along by listenin' to one another
Not only that but we also get along because of rhythms
That we've learned during the course of the years

But above all, there is harmony because we got to listen to one another
It's all about feeling
But with a positive attitude to make it work
And what we're about to show you today
Is FIVE different versions of feeling good, yeaahh

B-Boyd and B-Girls
Jurassic 5!
