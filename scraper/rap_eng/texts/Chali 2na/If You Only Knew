[Verse 1: Chali 2na]
Never, think just for shits and giggles
Do we spit syllable riddles for bits and kibbles
So chicks can wiggle and shake
Cuz this image is fake

[Verse 2: Akil]
I’m trying hard to relate in a place filled with so much hate

[Verse 3: Soup]
Some brothers debate some love and some hate
Whatever the case its all about the choices you make
That’s the reason you balloon'll deflate

[Verse 4: Chali 2na]
But do beleive we trying to rap back to its primitive state
Wait

[Verse 5: Marc 7even]
No overnight success or running with vets
Just pure unadulterated work progress
I’m willing to bet the farm you’ll give you right arm
For a piece of the pie ask yourself why

[Hook: All]
If you only knew, the trials and tribulations we’ve been through
But if you only knew, we real people homie just like you
We humble but don’t mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain’t used to
Soul music something we can all relate to

[Verse 6: Akil]
I ams what I am and that’s all I can be
No more no less what you seeing is me
Akil the MC W-I-S-E
Wise intelligent God did bless me

[Verse 7: Soup]
Yes we rock up off all the SP freshly especially
Dangerous rough and deadly

[Verse 8: All]
The pimp positioner
Tip the Richter scale

[Verse 9: Chali 2na]
Alone we sink together we sail and prevail
The rum raisin', coming through Guns blazin’
Some of you duns running through ones with none savin’
Complainin’, me and my clan are unscathin’
From the soul comes something amazing

[Hook: All]
If you only knew, the trials and tribulations we’ve been through
But if you only knew, we real people homie just like you
We humble but don’t mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain’t used to
Soul music something we can all relate to

[Verse 10: Akil]
How many times I gotta hear some fanatic in my ear
Tellin me to keep it real when they ain’t payin my bills
Or feeding my kids, judging me on how I live
If my crib in the hood or if its up in the hills

[Verse 11: Marc 7even]
Have you forgotten who you are?
O you think you’re a star
Why you frontin’ (you ain’t nothing)
You went from nothing to something
But something means nothing
If your people still wanting

[Verse 12: Chali 2na]
And you got money ain’t givin’ them nothing

[Verse 13: All]
Flossin and frontin

[Verse 14: Soup]
Your game of charades
The way you behave
The image you save
Your brother thats one big parade
I’m sick of your ways
I’m sitting here spitting the phrase
The next time they smile and they wave
Will probably be with the gays

[Hook: All]
If you only knew, the trials and tribulations we’ve been through
But if you only knew, we real people homie just like you
We humble but don’t mistake us for some corny ass crew
What we do is try to give you whatcha ain’t used to
Soul music something we can all relate to
Soul, soul, soul, soul..
