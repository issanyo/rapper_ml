Yo
A person who you might know well, like and trust
Can slither no matter how tight the clutch
They're standing here right
With us, nightly they fight and fuss
With enemies, plot 'til you bite the dust
Their hearts feels like disgust
Thinking their own light's enough
Every fire inside they like to snuff
It's something we might discuss, trust
My mama tight with us, with bullshit, she said, wipe and flush
She taught us how to give praises to God
Not worshipping human pastors
Just call me iconoclast, I'm cracking your wall plaster
People, Americans, put on pedestals fall faster
Forever the task of never grasping what they ask for
You question my loyalty, my fidelity
All I want is to peddle my poetry uncompellingly and
Catch a zone, for God sets the tone
I'm stretched alone until my name's etched in stone, that's why

[Hook:]
You need to know that you walk the trail alone
You can succeed together, but you fail alone
To the bone, pray together but you get judged alone
Work together but you try alone
You live together but you die alone
Ah-ah, la-la-la, la-la-la
You live together but you die alone
Ah-ah, la-la-la, la-la-la

Yo, the human crisis and my life's test
Is to try to conquer my vices with preciseness
I need to stop putting prices on what is priceless
Need to be righteous, and then I'll get a good night's rest
Trying to wipe stress by making the fight rest, plus
Bring energy to the lifeless, my mic test
I'm quite blessed and much
Better than theirs, no matter the cheers
Some of my character traits need weather repairs
Individual like the follicles from feathers and hairs
Not addicted to the power, haven't shedded a ?
The pursuit of currency can leave you dead on the stairs
My biggest life lesson, I need to be better prepared
I've never been scared to see what eyes are clouded by hate
But now I'm irate, surrounded by J, no cannot escape
From being black, suspected of criminal activity
I'm alone and it's never been more clear to me now
I see that I was immersed in fallacy
Reversed mechanically, this society's policy is
If ? keep the surface in mind, this Turkish design
So big can keep you purposely blind
Insert the divine, stop working behind enemy lines
It's finna be time, daily events, enemy signs
It's chilling my spine, to you shaytan set the tone
I'm stretched alone until my name's etched in stone, that's why

[Hook]
