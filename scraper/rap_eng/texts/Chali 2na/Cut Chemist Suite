[Verse 1]
2NA the smoke-jumper, packing my oral cannon
Bustin from Okinawa, Japan to Laurel Canyon
Swallow flows, we turning like plush tires
Mellow intros lyrics be burning like brush fires
Spreading vocal leprosy, using discrepancy
Lyric weaponry lessens your chances of testing me
Stop and freeze, MCs, I block atrocities
True philosophies from the lips of black Socrates
The pocket-penciler in your peninsula
Killing Dracula MCs who bit from my vernacular
I can back it. The ill scene we occupy
No lullaby, got you high, when I rock a fly
Verse, for my people, let me breath slow
Give a heave-ho, and stimulate your cerebral
System, Cut Chemist grip the fader
2NA the group debater
We murder you duplicators

[Hook]
'Cause I'm an aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift of rap
It's like that
(Rocks the house)
(Rock rock rock rocks the house)
Ah, the aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift of rap
It's like that
(Rocks the house)
(Rock rock rock rocks the house)

[Verse 2]
They call me Mister Antagonistic, drastic
Coming from a place where these cops get their ass kicked
The last trick unified was the cornerstone
But now a lyric pistol to the dome is how we warn a clone
Born alone, the strength of god makes my mission higher
They found a liar dead, strung up with fishing wire
The mystifier packing vocal artillery
Making lovely word connections like Chuck Woolery
The cool in me, I'll make your block turn on one rhyme
Electrifying like some nocturnal sunshine
The planetary pioneer and his mixer
(Cut Chemist), Chali 2NA spitting scriptures
Painting pictures
Even sisters adapt cuz we take it back
Like chiropractors fuckin' actors on wax
Make worse for real MC's who worth your while
So they search for me

[Hook]
The aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift of rap
It's like that
(Rocks the house)
(Rock rock rock rocks the house)
Ah, the aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift of rap
It's like that
(Rocks the house)
(Rock rock rock rocks the house)

[Bridge]
(Should I let)
(Should I let)
(Should I)
(Should I)
(Should I) ha, ha, ha
(Should I let) one, two
(Should I let)
(Should I let) one, two
(Should I)
(Should I let) check it
Should I let yah
Know
Should I mention that you lost a vital part of your body
Your competition with the T to the U, N-Ah
The phrase bender
Lyrical lead spinner thatâ€™s hittin' you dead center

[Hook]
The aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift of rap
It's like that
(Rocks the house)
(Rock rock rock rocks the house)
Ah, the aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift of rap
It's like that
(Rocks the house)
(Rock rock rock rocks the house)

[Outro]
Yo, yo
It's like that, ya'll
It's like that, everybody [?]
It's like that
My name is 2NA Fish, ya'll
It's like that
[?]
It's like that, ya'll
Ah, the aristocrat, ghetto diplomat
And I'm blessed with the gift of rap
It's like that
[Crowd applause]
Hey, ya'll gotta excuse me, man
I'm sick as hell
(He just sick in the head, that's all)
(Just sick in the head)
