Brothers of rhythm, libo
Stay tunned for Unity Community
Here at Rat Race, in the house
We're gonna give the band a chance to cool out
If you got a white Cadillac you need to move it
Right now you blocking somebody in and they can't get home
And their ready to leave
Check it

Wake up people and look at life around you
