Paint Graff Time, C'mon

[Hook: Chali 2na]
Yeah, I need to face it man
I'm addicted to the sound of the ball when I shake the can
Imma let my man stand patrol
While I exercise can control
It's Graff Time, C'mon
Yeah, I need to face it man
I'm addicted to the sound of the ball when I shake the can
Imma let my man stand patrol
While I exercise can control
It's Graff Time, Yo

[Verse 1: Chali 2na]
My main thing was to paint to gain fame
Not duly and aimed, and beautifully stained
Plain trains and walls the same thing
Incredible styles we maintained
Devoured cowards and we made 'em change names
Addicted I truly became to this
Wicked unruly insane
Sub-culture where painters became kings
So make room cause I came to create doom
On flat surfaces 'til I faint from paint fumes, Yep!
When security at the track look
Wretchedly fallible wack
Put pictures in black books
Sketchers and catchers set up the graff spots
With murals depict the struggles of the have-nots
Runnin' tunnels and hot spots
To be the only one
We bust slowly, the Krylon and Rustoleum
How my burners are slowly done
Fifteen, skill up a bliff clean
Messages in graffiti, no fuckin' writer can see me at all!

Hey, I need to face it man
I'm addicted to the sound of the ball when I shake the can
Imma let my man stand patrol
While I exercise can control
It's Graff Time, C'mon
Yeah, I need to face it man
I'm addicted to the sound of the ball when I shake the can
Imma let my man stand patrol
While I exercise can control
It's Graff Time, C'mon

[Interlude: Chali 2na]
Liquid hip-hop in my vein
Hop in the train
Since the sixth grade I have not been the same
Whether playin' ball or rhymin' in the hall
Or just writing my name in graffiti on the wall, yah...

[Sample 1]
Everything you paint will fade or fall off the wall or be buffed, or get dissed, or gone over, so it's like, you know, the walls are living and breathing

[Sample 2]
That rush, that rush is amazing. Knowing that you're standing out there alone... Surrounded by an entire world that most likely disapproves of what you're doing

[Verse 2: Chali 2na]
Yo, I counted my cans as I awaited my chance
I perpetrated my plans with ink and paint on my hands
Celebrated by fans of the vandal squadron
Who march in the dark so the dark start chargin'
Tagging your name and the clan you claim
On everything and your parents don't understand your pain
How beautifully tamed sceneries
And special tips disperse the paint evenly
Thirst just ain't leavin' me, yet!
Time stops when graffiti bombs drop
Cleverly cop a key to the intercom box
Beginners is gon' watch and veterans lay spray
Peace to Lee Fab, Futura and K-Slay, today!
