I sense havoc that triggers immense panic
Convince savages with the use of intense magic
Our prints planted your flesh against granite
The best is fish, dammit, the rest should just vanish
I search damages after my clique handles shit
No comparison, 2na is the best candidate
The diamond studded amulet on all this random shit
Making them abandon ship with the fresh manuscript
Yeah, so I reapproach the curvature
The game's covered like reupholstered furniture
Lyrical ligatures reinvented my signature
Prehistoric methods that readjust the temperature
(in California)
Been there for the best of my years
But I won't claim the west like the rest of my peers
When they see the aggression they got me testing you kids
And the lesson is ain't nobody messing with fish
It's like this

[Hook - Ming Xia]
Into the tide, go in and dive
Down deep below with the undertow
He'll guide us straight into the light
Go up against the current
Up against the current (yeah)
Up against the current (yeah)
Up against the current (yeah)
Ooh
Up against the current (against the)
Up against the current (against the)
Up against the current (against the current)

[Chali 2na]
When my verbage is inserted
It makes you skin curdle and told us you been nervous
I leap hurdles and murder you weak turtles
Complete service, the beat furnace
The heat burn us from this deep furnace
Embedded at chest level
When the dust settles there's an angel among devils
Boulder amongst pebbles
A discipline-minded soldier amongst rebels
Composure while others tremble
I'm saying you can't withstand the fish, man
The minute that my group switch plans it disband religions
Became abrasive like brillos and dish pans
And crumbled like a toothpick used as a kickstand
It's sick, fam
Although my luck seem dimmer
I'm the only tuna that's an upstream swimmer
Corrupt teams when they're using hatred as a fish deterrent
So I switched when I learned shit and pushed it against the current

[Hook - Ming Xia]

[Chali 2na]
The way son represent it, unprecedented
Brought it to your temple like there was a gun pressed against it
Coming fresher scented, with an impressive sentence
And those who witnessed have invested interest
Groundbreaking while you clowns faking
Here to fit your face and leave your whole town shaking
I make it sound blatant cause the fish could burn it
Here to heat the ocean in one motion, against the current

[Hook - Ming Xia]
