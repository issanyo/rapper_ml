[Verse 1: Chali 2na]
I'm on a higher plane
I’m in the fire lane
In use of my entire brain
Ignoring prior claims
And dire consequences

Music is higher consciousness don't mean to sound pretentious
I'm levitating off the ground efficient
I’ll take an ancient manuscript and make it sound delicious
Music is magic in Any topic of interest
And we are blessed to share it
These esoteric adventures
No harassing my veracity
Mamma sent me to class
To expand my mental capacity
While my teachers labeled me as a cool kid
My music taught me more than what school did
The truth is..

[Chorus: Slightly Stoopid]
We feelin' higher now
We never touch the ground
You know the music sets us free
Inside our minds we'll always be
So much higher now
Until we touch the ground
You know the music sets us free
Inside our minds we'll always be

[Verse 2: Chali 2na]
I don't hold grudges
But I remember facts
I took a look at the abyss
And now it's staring back
Sympathy for careless acts there's an apparent lack
Music's the key that unlocks this transparent latch
A melodic emancipation
Freedom from the
Volatile vibes and bad statements
Music’s been my ultimate
Path and safe haven
Otherwise I’m on the opposite side of
That glass casing
Scratch that last statement cuz what Im making is sacred
It's participation
And bar manipulation
Guitar riffs placed in the right
Bizarre space and if
And if you light a green spliff then I might just partake yeh
The verbal Herman Munster’s thirsty
And I'm concert worthy
With no controversy
Mind state's beyond
What you've formed about me
And my music will live on without me
Never doubt me

[Chorus: Slightly Stoopid]
We feelin’ higher now
We never touch the ground
You know the music sets us free
Inside our minds we'll always be
So much higher now
Until we touch the ground
You know the music sets us free
Inside our minds we'll always be
