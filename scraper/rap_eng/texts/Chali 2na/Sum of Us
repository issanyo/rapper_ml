[Chali 2na]
Sparkin' extreme spinach
Watchin' your scene plumett
If lyrics were green vomit
My vocals would clean stomachs
Addicts wean from it
Where dreams and green run it
The faces on money change like the host on Teen Sumit
I'm close to being done with this industry's cream driven
Supreme livin', seein' more demons than Gene Simmons
And mean fibbin' actors be adlibbin'
Fakin' the funk and some of us naturally had rhythm
Some of us act like they had women
Gats in the abdomen back when the fact is them cats
They didn't have nuttin
For certain I'm sure it's fiction but for some
The purest diction
Insures their jurisdiction
I'm kicking it up a level trying to stay in the red
Some stay in the bed, zombie
Like the Day of the Dead
With decay in the head
Playin' instead of stayin' ahead
Steadily portrayin' celebs, delayin' the inevitable
When some come round
They run down when they touch ground
They climb up the structures unsound
Some of you like the way my words caress tracks
While some of these politicians secretly suppress facts

Chorus: (2X)
[Both]
I'm sayin' through songs I write
My wrongs I right
If you wanna fight the power
Get the power to fight
Cuz some of us judge without knowing the man's inner
And some of us find fault in the sin and not the sinner

[Akil]
Influential ideas
Push pressure on my peers
That's why most of these brothers have short term careers
You appear to be what's happenin'
For a year you crackin'
One hitter quitter now you missin' in action
With no satisfaction from the streets
I only hear foolishness when you speak
I repeat, my predecessor's endeavor with pleasure
Lock and load, explode and come better
Hopin that generation X
Be more wicked with the flex
And not so quick to cash a check
And disrespect, talkin' guns and sex
Chasin' death, but end up gettin' layed to rest
At your request
You're at the end of your line
Out of your mind
Idle women, weed and wine
And shells for your nine
The blind lead the blind
Time after time
When you rhyme for the shine

Chorus (2X)

[Chali 2na]
Yo, I'm tellin' you to REBEL
But dude, if you stale
The 2na can tell
Either you're comin' to the party or you truant as hell
Politicians ain't got no problem puttin' you in the cell
It's like we rolled up a snowball and threw it in hell
See some of us are looted with mail and suited to swell
But still blind like you're fluent in Braille

[Akil]
Yo, I never can tell uh, why some make it or fail
Speak it and spell overcome and still prevail

[Chali 2na]
We ripple the water frequently
Blink if we show delinquency, please
Human frequencies
Have been diseased, A breeze ain't what I'm feelin'
Healin' is essential
Mental aggrivation shows you what we've been through

[Akil]
Yo, sign of the times influence the way I rhyme, man
Pick up a nine and put down your picket sign, man
Your life is worth way more than just some diamonds
Without bling I still gleam
Glisten and shine, man

Chorus (2X)
