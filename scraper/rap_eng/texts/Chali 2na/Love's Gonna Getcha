[Hook] x2
Before you know it, man, love's gonna getcha
And there ain't nowhere to run when it hits ya
You feel it in your heart when it stick ya
And you'll be left with all the pieces to pick up

[Verse 1]
Yo, well you can front if you want to
But what you will and what you won't do
Let me tell you:
Soon as love takes a handle, of your body
There ain't nothing that you can do
Now, everybody done felt that from fist fights
To try to get your love when they get they shit right
It can happen from poor folks to rich types
Your woman cheated cause she say that you don't hit right
But she don't understand the man is a psycho
A bad tempered fool
He's jealous, he might blow
Heh, When he opened the door, it was the sight of his life
He saw his brother on the floor with his wife
Now can you tell me, as a man would you take that?
Or would you reach for his neck and try to break that?
You be the judge, heh
See, love makes you do the strangest things
When it infects your heart, and it changes things
It's called love

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
Now are you ready for the comeback?
2na talkin' 'bout love on this drum track
One fact: All good, but in one act
Love will stick you in the ass like a thumb tack
It's uncool, when you dealin' with a friendship
One-sided, all give, and it's no get
Certain boy holds script to the slow flip...
Keep the people you trust next to you shit
(When you dealin' with love)
Cause certain people tend to walk that line
Then behind yo back, fuck that grind
(When you dealin' with love)
This shit will hit you with domestic crime
With dead bodies and the chalk out-line
(When you dealin' with love)
Just be careful
Cause there ain't nothing on this earth that can compare to
Beware of certain false words but appear true
And stay loyal with the ones that you dear to
That's when you dealin' with love

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3]
The Moral of the story is:
Love is treated like it's small - when it's really big
Many kids get treated like guinea pigs
People's hearts get crushed like skinny twigs
In the rush to satisfy the human urge
The feelin' is transferred by usin' words
Like this, cause up the bob the women and men have been touched
By the chemically reacted adrenaline rush we call love

[Hook] x4
