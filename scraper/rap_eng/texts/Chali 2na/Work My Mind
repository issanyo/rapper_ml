This wonderful age

[Chali 2na]
Yeah, yeah, testing

[Hymnal]
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around

[Chali 2na]
Work my mind at different spurts in time
We pollute evolution in pursuit of a dime
Wanna eat gotta grind so my thirst is blind
With no outlet for change people flirt(?) with crime
But I disperse my rhyme in the worst ...
If I switch course my line is a broken spine
No crisscross the straight path a search defined
But i misinterpret the signs at the worst of times
And you

[Hymnal]
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around

[Chali 2na]
Turn it around when they're burnin' it down
Permanent ... cloud
The black smoke relax folks ...
I'm determined to tell my government no vermin allowed

The onerous sound ... endowed
With a special set of skills that can level the crowd
Telling you devilish crimes ain't no women allowed
But now ... it down

Time to start a revolution and the moment is now
We could spark ... throw in the towel
...
... it down
Immediately heat it up and keep it low to the ground

[Hymnal]
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around

[???]
Yeah, in this world where you and myself belong
The good will exist but the bad will die!

[Chali 2na]
Work the mic until the earth ignites
But was it worth the fight to be first in flight
How do people think wealth will purchase life
But you can't fathom an item that is worth this price
In value

Tonight is wrong versus right
In the ... pressure will build 'til it burst ...
... surface ...
And never trust the illusion of a perfect life
Know how to

[Hymnal]
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around, you
Work my mind and turn it around

Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
Turn it around
