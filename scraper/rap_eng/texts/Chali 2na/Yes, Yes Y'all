[Intro]
Yeah (x8)

[Hook]
Yes y'all
Yes y'all, yes y'all
(x3)

Freak freak, y'all
Freak y'all
Freak y'all, freak y'all
To the beat y'all
Beat y'all, beat y'all
Beat y'all

And
And you don't stop
Don't stop, don't stop
And you don't quit
Don't quit, don't quit
And you don't
And you don't
(x2)

[Verse 1: Black Thought (of The Roots)]
Yo
Black's the real, he the thoroughbred for feel
Park the whip, jump out dressed to kill
Hop the charter flight down to Brazil
Ran right into Will, "What up Black?" ("What's the deal?")
A cape with a cane, you what'a'name
I got a little bit of change, but I'm feeling the same
Came here for a taste of the finer things
Cause the girls look like different months in a magazine
Judging on how fast the word go, they probably already know we here with Sergio
So, let's get a few classy girls yo
And sip a little wine, anything but Merlot, though
Live and let learn, use protec-churn
And twist a little sutt'a'last, Katherine Hepburn
Fresh to death, still makin them heads turn
Still getting mine, but you gots to get yer'n
Yo

[Bridge]
Know what I'm talkin about?
There it is... (there it is!!)

[Hook (Condensed)]

[Verse 2: Will.I.Am (of the Black Eyed Peas)]
It's the Will.I.Am that's killin them
Got flows that float just like helium *inhales*
These hoes know I'm drillin' 'em
So when feminines phone I'm thrillin' 'em *exhales*
Then billin 'em til I'm rollin in millions
Gotta flip billions into trillions
Businessly, I'm brilliant
Turn pennies into twenties like they chameleons
But I never put a chinchilla on a chick
Cause my style's too legit to quit
Hip-hop on and on and on and
Break mics constant til the break of dawn and
If you want to compete, come complete
Bring and MPC-16, make a big beat
We could take it back to the B-Street
We could break, we could rap, do the graffiti
Yo

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Chali 2na (of Jurassic 5)]
Hey!
2na Fish back to business
I hit the track like a sheer act of vengeance
Masked avengers, get smacked and injured
Strapped, they got yo back and some black suspenders
Autographs at the Jurassic booth
Coming past it we flash like a fashion shoot
Classics, spittin acid, the fastest route
Bass make yo face pinker than a passion fruit
Big cheese inflict sick disease
With hits that'll get thick chicks to strip tease
Clicks freeze when the trigger click squeeze
Makin people in the disco duck like Rick Dees
But I ain't come to war with y'all
And got no alcoholic beverages to pour with y'all
I'm gonna let these cats get they garbage off
While I'm rushin' 'em like I'm Mikhail Gorbachev
Yo

[Bridge]

Outro: Sergio Mendes (keyboard solo) and [Debi Nova (vocals)]

Baby don't you stop
Don't you stop don't you quit
(x2)

Don't you ever stop, don't you ever stop
Don't you ever quit
Don't you stop, don't you stop
Don't you, don't you ever quit ...

La la la, la la la la la (x2)
