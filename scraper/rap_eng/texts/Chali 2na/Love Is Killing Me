[Verse 1: Chali 2na]
Yeah
It's for your love that we do this
Yeah, we do it for you
For your love, some of you women, you have no clue
Everything that a real man do
We do it for you

[Chorus]
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
It's for your love that we do this
Yeah, we do it for you

[Verse 2: Chali 2na]
Yeah, the line wrapped around the building
Like the bow on a gift box
Skinny jeans, small tees, Jordans and thrift socks
The chicks rock yoga pants, sweaters and smag scarfs
And congregate at clubs, coffee shops and the dog parks
It all starts late, people wait at the gate
The gate-keeper think we ain't equal, security hate people
And straight treat you like Three Stacks, an OutKast
Those with clout pass, the rest fork out cash
As you enter the spot, temperature's hot
Young ballers spending infinite gwap, pimpin' the plot
Sip when they pop the bottles, put your tip in the pot
Or let the brown liquor hitcha, burn a spliff and then watch
The way the gal dem a wine up her body like so
And the mon dem a love how she party like whoa
It's ladies night
That's baby momma or maybe wife
Lookin' for love in these crazy lights like that?

[Chorus]
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
Yeah, we do it for you
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
High as can be
High as can be
Your love is killing me
