Yo, we thought we'd come a little different

Vintage verses
Sentence wordsmith
Here with no delay
Relax and don't decay
Turn to the DJ
He can make ya people say...
Hey...Hey

Let the rhythm heal your brain
While the party people sing (Hey!)

[Chali 2na]
Yo, the more you offer, displayin' your inner visions
Oral officers will be freein' your inhibitions
So skip an intermission and suddenly parlay
Cause movers are hot pumpin' in butter from parkay
You wonderin' what that prehistoric force is
Make you scream...
Hey...hey
Like a heard of hungry horses
Yes, the music you approached me with was inappropriate
Cause me and my associates are closely knit shit
The main course on the menu for today say...
Hey...hey
(talking in background)
Hey...hey

[Soup]
Now if theres a party for the gangstas here
The DJ's spinnin' records you don't wanna hear
To have it your way
Participate and make him play...
Hey...hey
I represent it, get wit it for the hood
The lights is turned low and the mood is all good
Whether you parlay
Or on the dance floor say...
Hey...hey
Regardless what you heard this year
The party atmosphere is only crackin' right here
And uh, we givin' you the theme that ya want
Cha come clean if ya want, know what I mean
If ya don't because...

[All]
We just wanna get you out
To the party everybodys talkin' bout

[Soup]

Six members fresh spinners, we make the fly ladies say...
Hey...Hey

Nation tan, nation tan, nation tan, nation tan
Shit, here it come again, here it come again
Here it come again, here it come again
Here it come again**
