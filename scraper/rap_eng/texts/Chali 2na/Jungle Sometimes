It’s like a jungle sometimes, makes me wonder how I keep from going under my sea

Broken glass, everywhere
The ghetto’s like an open gash you can’t repair
And if you can’t take the smell and the noise there’s no choice
You can tell people dwellin’ in hell with no voice
Rats, roaches, pickpockets and smokers and doughboys
Approach us promoting a way to cope with the bullshit
While pedophiles preach at the pulpit
A ghetto child come to school and he packing a full clip

Those who let crime take them under
Fall victim to the symptoms of time and they slumber
I keep it humble in kind in case I blunder
‘Cause the cities like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
I think I’m losing my mind, I’m too touchy
I’m standing too close to the edge, so don’t push me
Yeah
It’s like a jungle sometimes, the inner city’s like a jungle sometimes
It’s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under my seat

To get it in a
My rhyme penetrates
The time illustrates
Crime infested living space is really prime real estate
They will facilitate the suburb dwellers
And so they plot to take the property they prefer better
They serve letters of eviction
Transforming a grim slum
Into condominiums too much for lower income living
Give them vouchers and hotel certificates
To welfare recipients they kick them off the premises!
Politicians organize a mass exodus of lower class residents way past the city limits
No education, quadruple digit inflation, and now
They takin’ homes through regentifrication
Man

Those who let crime take them under
Fall victim to the symptoms of time and they slumber
I had to struggle with mine so take a number
‘Cause the cities like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
I think I’m losing my mind, I’m too touchy
I’m standing too close to the edge, so don’t push me
Yeah
It’s like a jungle sometimes, the inner city’s like a jungle sometimes
It’s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under my seat

[My Son Jeru Salaam]
And my son said
Daddy I don’t wanna go to school
Cause my father’s a rapper and most rappers are fools
And all my friends smoke reefer
It’d be easier and cheaper
If I joined the armed service, learn to shoot a street sweeper

[Chali 2na]
Okay
It’s hard to beat the street and compete with the elite
Every man needs to think if you can handle the heat
Cause it’s all about money
Ain’t a damn thing funny
And I ain’t gon’ let these suckers take a damn thing from me
A man parked his car, in front of the train
Killed more than 11 people but he got out and ran
Oscar grant got shot by a cop on the BART
And the cop got two years and a brand new star
Can’t walk through the park ‘cause it’s crazy after dark
Daily sound when guns bark, bodies found and some not
TSA is a migraine, surveillance and spy planes
And if you got an Arabic name, they think you might hijack the plane!

Those who let crime take them under
Fall victim to the symptoms of time and they slumber
See I’m that one with the rhyme, I bring the thunder
‘Cause the city's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
I think I’m losing my mind I’m too touchy
I’m standing too close to the edge so don’t push me
Yeah
It’s like a jungle sometimes, it’s like a jungle sometimes
It’s like a jungle sometimes, it makes me wonder how I keep from going under my seat
