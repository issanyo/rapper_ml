Yeah, it's Nizzy!

Yeah, I love waking up when I'm gone
Yeah, it's Nizzy!

Yeah, I love waking up when I'm gone
I love waking up when I'm blown
She all on me cause I'm on
She won't stop calling my phone
Well forget that she's trying to get wasted
My earring match my bracelet
I'm the man girl so just face it
And I love money so I chase it
I could show you how to hit ball rip
And I love the way that that thong fit
Said jet life yeah long trip
Don't type it girl take long sit

Smoking and drinking
Just party no sleeping
Look, nights like this
Look, nights like this
It feels like the weekend
Just clubbing and freaking
Look, nights like this

Man I love nights like this
Just like tomorrow with a brand new fill
That's right I'm finna kill it girl
So drink up don't spill it girl
Watch out before I steal your girl
Cause I'm the nigga just love this world
Hit the party and they know what's up
Fill up my solo cup
Head spinning like a yo yo bro
Damn I did it again

Bottles up hit it again

We living young and we reckless
Sipping champagne for breakfast
Just tattoos no necklace
And I'm leaning boy like Texas
If you're living life say 'Ay!'
If you came to party say 'Ay!'
If you're feeling good say 'Ay!'
If you're getting money say 'Ay!'

All that real one away
No way I'm feeling wasted time
I'm just sitting on a cloud
And I'm sipping on the finest wine
Ow yeah, ow yeah, ow yeah
Ow yeah, ow yeah, ow yeah
Ow yeah, ow yeah

Smoking and drinking
