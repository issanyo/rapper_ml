(Hook x4)
I've been grinding my whole life
Tryna make it out this gutter
Hustling like no other
Stand on this bread like butter

(Verse)
I've been grinding my whole life
Just a young nigga tryna get by
Got them haters still running their mouth
But I ain't mad, cause them numbers don't lie
I've got kush roll'd up right now
I can take you to a place in the sky
Hurricane got the streets on fire
You can see that pain, will you look into my eyes?
Ain't no telling' what I got in this cup
Thank God everyday I wake up!
Got a bad bitch, no make-up
Dick good, she don't wanna break up
I been putting in work on muff
OG's respect my huff
Party's cap, thuggers in my duff
I'mma need a champagne by the walking Gaza
See, real niggas move in silence
Bitch niggas always talking
See, I'm so fresh, 'til death
I can fuck me a bitch in a coffin
23s in my feet, I'm walking
I can lap you niggas when I'm jogging
I swear, this money keep calling
It won't be long 'til a nigga just ballin'
Can't wait 'til I'm in that Maybach
And my bank account full of them racks
Got bitches in my face, like gnats
If you're getting cheese, gotta watch them rats
I'dda make me so much, but I'm still tryna stack these bots
Niggas tryna talk us down, but we ain't ever gave no fuck

(Hook x4)
I've been grinding my whole life
Tryna make it out this gutter
Hustling like no other
Stand on this bread like butter

(Verse)(Moe Cheez)
What's yo' life up in my lifetime?! I grind, nigga!
Take a late night call from my momma telling me she'll be fine, nigga
I'll pass that, bitching up the numbers like nas that
Don't, not allowed, but I pass that
Only rags to riches where the cash at
Cause I need things and I got dreams
My whole life I'dn pray for the same dreams
My whole life I've been enslaved fo'
And I'm just tryna make it out the gutter
I ain't out here on my own, I'm tryna make it for my brother
Cause these hard times, they getting harder
And these bitch niggas, they gettin' smarter
They say I'm tryna live, I been grinding all my life
Niggas, something's gotta give (nigga!)
Before they get me wid my hand out
I'll be back on the block with my hand out
Grind hard, that's what I did, nigga
Cause I was taught to get it how you live, nigga!
