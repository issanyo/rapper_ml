[Intro]

[Hook]
Look at my watch, look at my chain
They brand new
Look at the wheels on that thing
They brand new
All these shoes, All the clothes
They brand new
All this money, All these hoes
They brand new
Brand new, Brand new
She don't like my attitude, she said its brand new
Brand new, Brand new
You never seen this shit before because its brand new

[Verse 1]
Had to grind hard, tryna make a living
Put on my city, now I'm eating like its thanksgiving
Its all lives on me, feel like a television
Shout out to all my niggas locked up in that cell division
I'm poppin' rubber bands on you fuck niggas
Doing the gettin' money dance on you fuck niggas
I'm tatted up don't make me take my shirt off
I said I'm tatted up don't make me take my shirt off
Pull up on that pussy like I'm finna park in it
She said its wet but she ain't never had a shark in it
Had to cop a Louis belt just to feel right
Obama off a molly when I feel light

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Get rich or die trying, like 50 Cent
I'm just a young gunner tryna get that 50 bread
Hurricane Gang bitch, that's whats up
Thats why we got a bottle boy and you got a cup
Signing autographs now they claim they talking to ya
Swear they praise a nigga now, Hallelujah
They said the cops coming, better put them drugs up
They said the cops coming, better put them drugs up
Everything's brand new its like I got a genie
They gone hate it when a nigga get that Lamborghini
Fuck a duffle bag boy, I need a money counter
Thats cause there money on the floor, money on the counter

[Hook]
