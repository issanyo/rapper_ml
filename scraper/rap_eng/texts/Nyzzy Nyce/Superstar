[Nyzzy Nyce]

It's been a long year...
I never imagined it would be like this but...
Somtimes you just gotta keep going... yeah!

[Chorus]
The whole world know I'm doing my thang
Sitting V.I.P just to sip champagne
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar
Now in every city they be yelling my name
Late night flights that's spending on a plane
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar

[Verse 1: Nyzzy Nyce]
Waking up, with my mind gone
Just tryna figure out where all this times gone
Late night flights, switching time zones
All these dudes falling off like some pinecones
Some camel shorts, and some striped socks
Been locked up once so I don't like cops
I'm a different breed, feel like I'm cyclops
All I need is some red bull and some eye drops
I bet some people never thought I would make it here
Im tatted up, I never thought I'd take it there
Bone crusher blood boy, I'm never scared
And now people showing love, that never cared
But I guess, thats how life goes
Just making sure I'm heading down the right road
Swear they can't see me, blind folds
And I'm a go hard until the day my eyes close

[Chorus]
The whole world know I'm doing my thang
Sitting V.I.P just to sip champagne
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar
Now in every city they be yelling my name
Late night flights that's spending on a plane
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar

[Verse 2: Nyzzy Nyce]
Step up on the stage, them girls yelling for me
Tryna do right, the devil dwelling for me
Shout out to my phone, it do the spelling for me
And to all the fans, the story tell it for me
We on are way up, we on are way up
Tank top and a fitted stay laced up
And my body full of ink from the waist up
Like everyday my birthday, I'm caked up
And I swear to God, I love this life
That's why I'm doing the same stuff every night
When you a superstar, these people get polite
I promise this champagne got me feeling right
And I wouldn't give this up for anything
Finally I made it into the hall of fame
And I stay on point, like a shark fang
I swear this the only song my heart sang

The whole world know I'm doing my thang
Sitting V.I.P just to sip champagne
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar
Now in every city they be yelling my name
Late night flights that's spending on a plane
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar

So no matter what they say
Just know you a star
Just know you a star
So no matter what they say
Just know you a star
Just know you a star

The whole world know I'm doing my thang
Sitting V.I.P just to sip champagne
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar
Now in every city they be yelling my name
Late night flights that's spending on a plane
Now I feel like a superstar
Now I feel like a superstar
