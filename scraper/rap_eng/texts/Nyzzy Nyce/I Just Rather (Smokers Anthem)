[Hook]
Yea, Owww, I just rather...
(Blow)
I'd just rather, smoke
I'd just rather, smoke
I'd just rather, smoke
I'd just rather, smoke
I'd just rather

[Verse 1]
Still a young nigga, tryna get it
Still got my hometown on my fitted
If success them shoes must fit it
Can't climb to the top cause the sky's no limit
Don't care about much, but smoke
Stay high forever? Yeah, that be dope
Capricorn so that means I'll be G.O.A.T
There goes another fifth down my throat
Man, I got problems
And this little green bud just solves 'em
So crazy what could cause 'em
Make me wanna shit on all em
Life's ups and downs, and damn
Ain't that a bumpy road to travel?
I had nightmares of me, getting lost in all the shadows

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I know some niggas probably want me dead
What goes on in his crazy head?
Heart gone stop before a tear gets shead
Peanut butter, jam how I'm on that bread
These people wanna see me change
But I get change, man, fuck these people
I know God didn't make me evil
I'mma be heavenly for my sequel
And man (man)
I love this weed you understand (you understand)
To make it out, that's the plan
And I don't give a damn
I'd rather, smoke
I'd rather, go

[Hook](x2)
