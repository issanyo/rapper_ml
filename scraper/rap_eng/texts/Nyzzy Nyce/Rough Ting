[Intro]
Report to the dance floor
Report to the dance floor
Report to the dance
Report to the dance floor

[Verse 1]
Inspired
Can't stop where I'm touching
A slap on my wrist
As my hand gets low
What where you thinking
Did your mind tell you
Stop but keep going
You little rough ting

[Bridge]
Skin so soft no need for lotion
Rocky tough just like a mountain
Crazy wave just like a ocean
That I don't wanna get out of
From head to toe amazing body
Got this attitude that's wishy washy
Scratch my back bae
And i will scratch yours
I'm up for the challenge

[Chorus]
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
Don't take no mess from nobody
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
You bring the fire to the party
That freaky dance you do it so well
The sexy things you say makes me go deaf
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
Yup I'm in love and I know it

[Verse 2]
Watch when I come behind
Glued to your waist line
Angry as a rhino but
Sweet as cotton candy
Oh I like it feisty
Girl wine up pon it on me
Girl wine up pon it on me
Girl wine up pon it on me

[Bridge]
Skin so soft no need for lotion
Rocky tough just like a mountain
Crazy wave just like a ocean
That I don't wanna get out of
From head to toe amazing body
Got this attitude that's wishy washy
Scratch my back bae
And i will scratch yours
I'm up for the challenge
Challange

[Chorus]
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
Don't take no mess from nobody
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
You bring the fire to the party
That freaky dance you do it so well
The sexy things you say makes me go deaf
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
Yup I'm in love and I know it

[Verse 3: Nyzzy Nyce]
Girl you super bad like the movie though
Fat ass waist tighter than a sushi roll
You said you want a man that can under stand
Who really hold you down you'll never truly know
She always bring the flames to the party
And all she wants is cocaine and Bacardi

Now she walking in the lobby with her ass out
Damn How you fit those jeans ma
You already know I wanna get in between ma
Walk down Melrose whippin that beama
I'll be in the studio




[Chorus]
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
Don't take no mess from nobody
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
You bring the fire to the party
That freaky dance you do it so well
The sexy things you say makes me go deaf
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
Yup I'm in love and I know it

You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
Don't take no mess from nobody
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
You bring the fire to the party
That freaky dance you do it so well
The sexy things you say makes me go deaf
You're a rough ting
You're a rough ting
Yup I'm in love and I know it
