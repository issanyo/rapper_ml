(You wanna ride, then we gon' ride)
(You wanna roll, then we gon' roll)
(You wanna ride, then we gon' ride)
You wanna roll, then we gon' roll

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we run the city, we run the track
Now we get it and go like a running back
O-O--On the road to glory, one amazing story
Still get bread and butter, I emerge from the gutter
You can like it or love it, ain't no man above it
They tried to hold me down, now I hold the crown
A-A--Ain't no looking back boy, Iâ€™m on the speedway
Speeding through traffic like a relay, top drops on the freeway
Yeah, I get what I want, no genie
I got a thick chick in bikini, a new Lamborghini
'Cause I'm in the fast lane, I'm gone
They just mad 'cause they off and I'm on

[Hook]
Holler, yeah (yah)
They just mad 'cause they off and I'm on (uh), yah
They just mad 'cause they off and I'm on

[Post-Hook]
You wanna ride, then we gon' ride
You wanna roll, then we gon' roll
You wanna ride, then we gon' ride
You wanna roll, then we gon' roll

[Verse 2]
Time is money, my diamonds sunny
Come see me I reside on a island, honey
Got my tires burnin' and my engine smokin'
Chaos makes it hard to focus, I got from where the
Kids is hopeless, but I always remain the dopest
Look good when I'm pushin the locus
Gas pedal to the floor, making it roar
I'm the man, baby girl, what you taking me for?

[Hook]
H----Holler (yah)
They just mad 'cause they off and I'm on (ha, uh)
They just mad 'cause they off and I'm on

[Post-Hook]
You wanna ride, then we gon' ride
You wanna roll, then we gon' roll
You wanna ride, then we gon' ride
You wanna roll, then we gon' roll

They just mad 'cause they off and I'm on
