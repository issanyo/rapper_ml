[Intro]
Man, fuck back then
Ya fuck it
It's some G
What you doing right now boy

[Hook]
Man, fuck back then we're the shit right now
Ya, hurricane in we're the shit right now
We headed to the top, we're the shit right now
Ain't never gonna stop we're the shit right now
(x2)

[Verse 1]
Man, fuck back then we're the shit right now
Got all these haters on my dick right now
If I had Cristal I'd take a sip right now
Cause money over everything is how I get down
Take a bad bitch on a shopping spree
Yelling out "olly olly oxen free"
That's why your girl's still steady jocking me
Cause you a lame nigga trying to copy me
Keep your mind on your money not me nigga
You're only good for wrapping when it's Christmas niggas
The infant up in a misfit in an instant
I'll be getting Gs like Irisbus nigga
When it comes to beats I'm a serial killer
Real dope spitter, swags still iller
Fuck a fake nigga cause I'm so real-uh
Ya, fuck a fake nigga cause I'm so real-uh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ain't never gonna to stop and that's what it's gonna be
All these little niggers want to be like me
Rocking some coats and a V like me
Get a bad jigger keep it G like me
It don't come easy, take work my nigga
Grind all the time till it hurt my nigga
He mad cause his girl just want to flirt my nigga
So fall back there looking like a jerk my nigga
And don't want nobody like this tattooed nigga
Cause after he pays for them tattoos nigga
Now I go nuts like a cashew nigga
I ain't never looking back cause I'm past you nigga
Old Gs do my grafics
And double Ms do my videos
And Double K, that's my DJ
And we're still running shit like relays
(Unintellagable)
It'ld take to long to nail my chicks
There's a formula to be me
But it won't work nigga, you're not me
Ya, there's a formula to be me
But it won't work nigga, you're not me
It won't work nigga, you're not me, ya

[Hook]

[Outro]
Man fuck back then (x4)
