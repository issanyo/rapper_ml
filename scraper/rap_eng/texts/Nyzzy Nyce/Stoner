[Hook]
You fucking with a stoner
A mufuckin' Stoner (Nyzzy)
Girl you fucking with a Stoner
A mufuckin Stoner

[Verse 1]
Smoking hella good
You already know that
And the money all good
So we finna blow that
Believe I did it
Came in your motherfucking city
Smoking on this good tree
You know how high we could be
Tell that bitch bounce it
We ain't sitting on it either, we be blowing ounces
Feel like them voices, they be callin'
And my body it be fallin', cause

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
We come alive in the moonlight
A profit is to get the move right
I don't know when I'm coming down,cause I would rather take flight
Pull up on you and shut it down, because you shining like some break lights

[Hook x2]

[Outro x4]
I'm a stoner
The only thing that gets me right
