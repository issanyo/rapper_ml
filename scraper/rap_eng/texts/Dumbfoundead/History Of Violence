Violence is an addiction. Violence won’t listen
We can wish for peace, but can speak violence into existence. Violence is tradition
(God bless America)

[Chorus: The Chancellor]
See I’ve been dreaming of angels on the battlefield
Seen 'em falling from heaven with intent to kill
I’m surrounded like I’m the one that broke the seal
This history of violence, this history of violence, yeah
Who the fuck gon’ save me my brotha
Who the fuck gon’ save me?
Who the fuck gon’ save me my brotha
Who the fuck gon’ save me?
Who the fuck gon’ save me my brotha
Who the fuck gon’ save me?
Who the fuck gon’ save me yahhhh
Who the fuck gon’ save me!

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Resume read like the GOAT (speech)
History of violence HOV (speech)
Blood on the deed of our home
So glad pops ain't show me the ropes (preach)
I ain't ever raise my hand to a woman or in class
Won't obey no man
Prayers been ignored by the prophets
So I been at war with the world like John Wick
I don't play that gook or that chink shit
Got me hot like the hood of my Lincoln
I was givin' out the link in my bio
When they thought that I was givin' my LinkedIn
My culture don’t believe in shrinks
Like we writing with invisible ink
So I been going off with a Viriginia Tech flow
I leave this behind as the manifesto
Little homie, runnin’ up on the bigger homie
Little homie, wonder why their parents split up on me
Little homie, got history like he roll with Kony
Little homie, I’m treatin’ POTUS like little homie
Paranoia, pushin’ him to another level
Paranoia, finding peace inside a cigarillo
Been killin since puttin' my fillings under pillows
Made a demon from a demo

[Chorus: The Chancellor]
See I’ve been dreaming of angels on the battlefield
Seen 'em falling from heaven with intent to kill
I’m surrounded like I’m the one that broke the seal
This history of violence, this history of violence, yeah
Who the fuck gon’ save me my brotha
Who the fuck gon’ save me?
Who the fuck gon’ save me my brotha
Who the fuck gon’ save me?
Who the fuck gon’ save me my brotha
Who the fuck gon’ save me?
Who the fuck gon’ save me yahhhh
Who the fuck gon’ save me!

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
The grainy footage, proof inside the pudding
America put a foot in that ass to simply put it
(Is you looking?) The body cams and the whoopings
(is you looking?) The body bags and the crooked
While you looking through the bushes, you’re like
I don’t wanna get involved with you
That ain't my people, it's wrong, but that's y’all issue
I can’t rock with you, if you ain't showing solidarity
Little homie little homie let me talk to you!
(Reporting live) Live from the belly of the beast
The tower is available for lease
5-star Napoleon complex
White sheets in the Presidential Suite
At the front desk, check in your beliefs
Now you're one step closer to the dream
Every time somebody leave, they leaving a bloody mess
But ain't nothin' room service couldn’t clean

[Chorus: The Chancellor]
See I've been dreaming of angels on the battlefield
Seen them falling from heaven with intent to kill
I’m surrounded like I’m the one that broke the seal
This history of violence, this history of violence
Who the fuck gon’ save me my brotha
Who the fuck gon’ save me?
Who the fuck gon’ save me my brotha
Who the fuck gon’ save me?
Who the fuck gon’ save, who the fuck gon’ save
Who the fuck gon’ save me?
Who the fuck gon’ save me, yahhhh
Who the fuck gon’ save me!

(Can we all get along?)
