When I met you up in Caf√© Blu
You had a cloud of smoke around you
It was 2 am, sipping on soup
Tugging on my coat-tail
I was tugging on you

REFRAIN:
Ha-ha
Ah
What could i do wit a K-Town girl? (x2)

Never seen an ass so round
Pretty brown hair to the ground
Make a young pimpin' say his vows
Met a girl in k town
Sool, soju
Two hands, old school
Never had a girl so down
Met a girl in K-Town

V1:
You only spoke a little bit of English
But your shoe game was the meanest
A star cause you fresh outta FIDM
And you ain't fuckin' with no nigga in a Civic
Your daddy never really like dark folk
But you don't know your daughter like I know
Said she made enough to pay the car note
And a condo, somewhere on Serrano

REFRAIN:
Ha-ha
Ah
What could i do wit a K-Town girl? (x2)

Never seen an ass so round
Pretty brown hair to the ground
Make a young pimpin' say his vows
Met a girl in k town
Sool, soju
Two hands, old school
Never had a girl so down
Fuck around in K-Town

(Random audio clip of Korean girls laughing)

V2 (Dumbfoundead):
Three models surrounded by green bottles
Green bottles with labels of dream models
Second round going down, please follow
After hours karaoke and end with king taco
Oops
I mean El Taurino
Rosy cheeks looking redder than the sauce, Pinche Chino
A couple hours ago we were dancing up in VR
Booking girls to the table when I met a sweetheart
She told me that I wasn't like them other assholes
She got hit on by 20 dudes at Belasco
King of K-Town, roll to my castle
Three dollar cabs, no hassle

REFRAIN:
Ha-ha
Ah
What could i do wit a K-Town girl? (x2)

Never seen an ass so round
Pretty brown hair to the ground
Make a young pimpin' say his vows
Met a girl in k town
Sool, soju
Two hands, old school
Never had a girl so down
