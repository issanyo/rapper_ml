[Gingerbread Man]
You a small bear with fuzzy hair over there
Get away from me I don't wanna share my air
Doesn't matter where, anywhere
Everywhere with you
Chop you in two with my rap kung fu
Are you scared of me? Boo!

[SORB]
You're like a cookie who's about to crumble
Your rapping is stale
Also you mumble
Did you just make a mistake?
Smelling like a cake who just stumbled into a lyrical rumble
Your raps causes naps
You look a little frail and you're about to collapse
You know you got beat when you hear the people's claps

[Looks over at FP and Finn]

Look who decided to come out to play
The news on the streets is you're gonna battle me at Rap Fest Day
This is a joke right? Hear me out
What are you even gonna rap about?
You've been in the bottle since the age of two
I've got shampoo more worldly than you
I would do laps around your raps
I crush my opponents and collect the caps
If you wanna keep yours on I suggest you run
People holla at me because I'm number one
