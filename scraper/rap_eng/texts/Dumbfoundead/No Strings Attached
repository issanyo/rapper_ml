Verse 1:
I was at an artshow, just for the free booze, filled with the bougie schmoozing trying to be cool, then a pretty little thing pointed at a painting, asked me what I thought, but didn’t know what I was saying, I mumbled some shit about Warhol then played it off, changed the subject then proceeded with my mating call, asked her a bunch of unnecessary questions, then hit on her using some corny art reference, like girl your body’s like a masterpiece, she responded like oh wow now that was cheesy, she said calm down, be relaxed and easy, and I almost fell in love when she passed the bleezy, didn’t asked for her name, she didn’t ask for mine, I just whispered in her ear girl your ass is fine, what a classic line, lets grab a glass wine, and go back to your crib or go back to mine

Hook 1 (Mayer Hawthorne):
Well I don’t need to know a thing about your past, ohh ohh, no I just want one night with you no strings attached, ohh ohh, and I know that we might not be a perfect match, but I just want one night with you no strings attached

Verse 2:
We stumbled into her small studio apartment, clothes scattered everywhere and little dog barkin, growling and giving me that stanky look, with her coffee tabletops filled with Banksy books, with a crate full of records, kitchen floor checkered and a framed up poster of Audrey Hepburn, I don’t care what she’s into im into her, and just one night of fire will prevent the burn, lets take our clothes off, before the buzzkill, roll with the punches like we’re taking love pills, sweat like your pedaling your fixie uphill, this ain't love baby this is just how love feels, lets chill, one night till the sunlight, this is just fun right, and we’re just young right, Ima kiss you down to your tattooed little hands, wake up to crushed up Pabst Blue Ribbon cans

Hook 2 (Mayer Hawthorne):
Well I don’t need to know a thing about your past, ohh ohh, no I just want one night with you no strings attached
Its one o’ clock in the mornin’, and your buzzin’ like a honeybee, why you tryin to control it when you wanna just come home with me

Verse 3:
I pretended like I ain't seen the pictures of her man, pictures of em together on there trip to japan, this is one night no strings so I could give a damn, some of the best nights end up never being planned, she a graphic designer im a passionate rhymer, maybe one day she can design me a rap flyer, I ain't know much about her but I know enough, we got up the next morning and then rolled one up, got high, locked eyes and made out a bit, ordered some take out and grubbed out like pigs, spent a lazy sunday with one cool chick, not a single regret, I wouldn’t undo shit, we knew what was up, you can call us both sluts, but we woke up feeling like a million bucks, I just picked up my wallet and my keys from the ground, didn’t exchange numbers, I’ll see you around
