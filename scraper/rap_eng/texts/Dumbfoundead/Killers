[Verse 1]

Black beanie, a sack of wheaties, and dirty chucks
My guest list has the owner pissed cause it's thirty plus
Roll to the show with the homies crammed in a sturdy truck
Pull up and see the chicken bet you can hear them birdies cluck

Arm full of wristbands, special kinds for them VIPs
Big man on campus all access do whatever I please
Doing my stretches and getting ready to rock the mic
With Zo on the tables he be cutting more than my pocket knife

Yeah, this is like every night, meeting strangers in paradise
Blow up the speakers my crew be deeper than Mr. Barry White
Let's see them hands with your cotty cans we be getting drunk
I got that Krypto-chrono-cunalite just hit is once

We go and get it don't know where the flow is headed
The hoes are wet and they sweatin' cause homie is photogenic
It's genetics I give credit to my grand daddy
But everyone in the house tonight is my damn family

[Hook]

Young and reckless, Bloody Mary's for breakfast
Night when you step in, bright when you exit
(I'm a killer) Killers on the move
Check one two, one two

Gonna kill it tonight (Murderah)
Let's kill it tonight (Murderah)
We're gonna kill it tonight, we're getting sore tonight, we're all killers tonight

(Murderah)x4

[Verse 2]

Murda murda murda, kill kill kill
I'll put it on anybody that you will feel chills
We gonna get it poppin' call me Poppa Orville
Redenbacher, I'm the monster in the movie Cloverfield

The road is filled with haters, you know the drill
The paper is the only thing I focus on, smoke until my throat is gone
Laugh now, pay later, you're the one the joke is on
Everybody yelling "go dumb" like it's an Oakland song

I put my hours in, no need for you to power trip
I got me plugs and connections like an electric power strip
I tell how it is, bow to the gangster Ghengis Khan
A major label put Wax on, now it's time for Daniel-san

You seen the viral clips, five forty spiral kicks
I bring the fire like pyrotechnics, my style is sick
Why did it take so long for you to have acknowledged this
Peep my shit on YouTube and you too will want to call it quits

[Hook]
