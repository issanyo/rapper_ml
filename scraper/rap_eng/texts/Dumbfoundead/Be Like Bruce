[Verse 1]
Used to have posters on the wall, greatest of them all
Marley, Ali, Jordan with the ball
Role models all black 'till I heard about a star
From the banging Hong Kong that broke down doors
First name Bruce, last name Lee
Finally somebody that looks just like me
Bad motherfucker that can kick 5 feet
I been feeling like him when I'm kicking my frees
Back in Crenshaw they called me Bruce
He's the only other Asian cat they knew
But that there's cool never took any offense
Took it as a compliment, a making of a future legend
Died too young yet I felt like I knew him
Watching all his interviews words were the truest
He said be fluent so I did it in my music
I know you can hear dam flowing it's Bruce

[Hook]
I just wanna be like Bruce
I just wanna be like Bruce
I just wanna be like Bruce
I just wanna be like Bruce
First name Bruce, last name Lee
Finally somebody that looks just like me

[Verse 2]
30 years passed since the death of the legend
First black president welcome to the present
Asian American youth
Lookin' at the posters on the wall all bruised
Lookin' at the marks on the arms all bruised
Father found out that she chose art school
Mother found out that her son was gay
Said she'll pray every day for him took his last name
Funny how that work we're movin' backwards
Tryna make history from previous chapters
Parents leading us towards devious pastors
Thinking that church is the easiest answer
But nah! Can't take away our heroes
When we try to make more of them we need those
All of those posters on the wall they mean more to them
Then you'll ever know, growing that warrior within

[Hook]
I just wanna be like Bruce
I just wanna be like Bruce
I just wanna be like Bruce
I just wanna be like Bruce
First name Bruce, last name Lee
Finally somebody that looks just like me

Brother Bruce, always spitting that truth
He appeared in a dream and told me I got the juice now
He planted seeds I'm trying to grow out the roots now
So I proceed to rock and tear the roof down
Brother Bruce, always spitting that truth
He appeared in a dream and told me I got the juice now
He planted seeds I'm trying to grow out the roots now
So I proceed to rock and tear the roof down
