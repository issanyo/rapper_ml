[Intro: Dumbfoundead]
Engine, engine, engine, engine, engine off, windows up
That's the way I like to puff
Engine on, windows up
That's that's the way I like to, like to
Engine off, windows up
That's the way I like to puff
Bass, ba ba bass hard
Let it bump, let it bump

[Verse 1]
I'm on that green lantern, rollin' up them papers, see the green glow
Blowin' smoke down the Cali coast like a steamboat
Yeah
You know the whole team dope
On that Charlie Brown cloud, follow it where we go
I buy that Hulk in bulk
Call it Costco
Use my harvest to garnish the metal with cilantro
Sweeties surround me like I'm having a bake sale
Wonder why I measure brownies on a weight scale
Fairfax, Venice Beach, K-Town, USC
Everywhere the medics be
Everyone be goin' green
Streets to the hills, filled with your celebrities
Smokin' like the 70's
I live my life forever green

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's on you
Liquor bottle, Green soju
Whole crew, Clownin' on the brown shit they sold you
Blonde hair, breezy, she be messin' with that white
Once you go green you'll be feelin' extra right
One eyed, one horned, flyin' purple pill eaters
When you comin' down you gon' need that chiba chiba
The grass is green
Carded up so don't hassle me
First to hit the hot box, usually the last to leave
Engine off, windows up, that's the way I like to puff
Bass high, let it bump
Woofers barkin' out the trunk
Mornin' or the noon, night time while I cruise
Me and Marley on the move
Color green is my mood
NY to ATL
In Miami blowin' L's
All my hustlers trynna sell
With the homies or by myself
Alabama, Tennessee
Down in Houston where Devin be
Oh it feels so heavenly
I live my life forever green

[Hook]
