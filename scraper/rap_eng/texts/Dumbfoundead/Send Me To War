[Bridge: Jessi]
I've been thru battles
But never love is the cause
I put my heart on a trigger
Down to my flaws
They here to play me
Then try to kiss me tomorrow
And leave me defeated
Before they send me to war
I'm down to battle like
Everything is at cost
Till I run outta ammo and
All my freedom is lost
You can’t be trusted
When all your fingers are crossed
Setting it off , now y'all setting me off

[Chorus: Jessi]
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Cold hearted to the Purple Hearts
War zone to a work of art
I learned the hard way, finessed a parlay
Your life and mine are now worlds apart

Bless my enemies and broken bonds
Some are dead to me and some are fallen
Built and wrecked it like the Berlin Wall
Fucked up what we had to fuck up commas

Ain't no forever shit
Call me a pessimist
I seen them look in your face and smile
While killing you softly, they make it look effortless

Brother to enemy, lover to memory
Just remember what comes after dark
Losing my family, curse of the Kennedies
With my niece a new chapter starts

Look at the scars, yes
Look at the squad, yes
Less than we started with, dearly departed to
Posse of all yes men

All is fair in love and war
I don’t think you want a war
Going hard and overboard
Die for the squad, lets go to war

[Chorus: Jessi]
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war

[Verse 2: Lyricks]
Front line with the drum line
Young guns and they brought nines
Young brother, we gotta protect the blood lines
For the family, you love 'em cause I love mine

We waited for the one time
They ain't even come one time
A-yo they don't got no love for my city
Look what they done to my city
That was chitty chitty bang bang
Tell me you wouldn't have done the same thing

With the damage, and the anguish, and the anger
We banded, to shoot bandits
In the name of our neighbors
Steadily reloading our chambers
With the Bangers, damn it

What'd you expect?
Had to defect
Help wasn't comin', they abandoned the ship
Strangle the snake
Pass me a pistol and hand me a clip

[Verse 3: JL]
25 years after the riots and there's still people dying in the streets, huh
Still people screamin' out 'Fuck The Police', huh
People gettin' beat up
Cause they decided to speak up

Try to look inside the mind of a street kid
At the scene while police did
At the scene what police do
And seeing all the fires and the riots that are tied to his people

This is the time to get lethal
Please mom don't cry for me
Cause I finally get to fight, and I finally feel like I get to pick a side in this

Cause everybody wanna side with me, [?]
Fuck ominous, fuck a Donald trump and fuck politics
Listen this'll be the mark that I leave on this earth
'Til I bleed, so just arm with guns and....

[Bridge: Jessi]
I've been through battles
But never love is the cause
I put my heart on a
Trigger down to my flaws
They here to play me
Then try to kiss me tomorrow
And leave me defeated
Before they send me to war
I'm down to battle like everything is at cost
Till I run outta ammo and
All my freedom is lost
You can’t be trusted
When all your fingers are crossed
Setting it off , now y'all setting me off

[Chorus: Jessi]
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war, send me to war
Love and defeat me and
Then you send me to war
Send me to war
