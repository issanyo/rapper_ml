Your doing during your sleep, curiously, keeping an eye like security, are you hearing me, what there doing is weak, sauce, underneath god, there should'nt be any middlemen benefiting off of the innocent, men and women struggling trying to get em some medicine, making minimum to diddily squat, these messages I'm ritalin cause I finna get popped

Bang this message might self destruct, so if it blow up in my face will you help me up

I said bang they might come assasinate me, then tell all of yall I was just exxagerating

Bang bang I hope that it finally hits ya, and after it does know that they'll be coming to get ya

Bang bang we're shooting out bullets of truth, bang bang we're shooting out bullets of truth
