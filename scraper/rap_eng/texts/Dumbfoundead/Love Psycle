[Intro]
First you find it so intriguing
Your heart is beating, it's so misleading
The want grows into "God, I need it"
Then you end up finding it slowly leaving
You look for something just the same
So you can feel it once again
You go through strangers, but it's strange
And try to salvage what remains

[Verse 1]
Drunken advances, multiple chances
Rookie romantics in need of practice
We’re students of love, in and out of classes
Go for the ride until it crashes
I've been through enough to have learned my lessons
From puppy love throughout my adolescence
We’re friends and enemies, the same identity
You’re a source of strength but a waste of energy
We play that game that some aren’t built for
Feel that pain that some would kill for
We drank, we smoked, we’ve taken the pillform
Got high with you even as your mentor
What we had seemed irreplaceable
'Til I ran and got a taste of new
But my sex drive was just a waste of fuel
Should've just used it all on my race to you

[Bridge]
I'm naked, I'm numb
I'm stupid, I'm stayin'
And if Cupid's got a gun
Then he's shootin'
Lights black, heads bang
You're my drug, we live it
You're drunk, you need it
Real love, I'll give it

[Hook]
So we're bound to linger on
We drink the fatal drop
Then love until we bleed
Then fall apart in parts

[Verse 2]
When I'm in, I'm in, put my chips on black
Your kiss burned my lips like I just hit crack
Turn the lights off, we get it crackin'
Turn the lights on and we lose the passion
We try new things by lying and cheating
A constant cycle of goodbyes and greetings
Act like love has a higher meaning
We’re afraid to let loose of are tied up demons
Time consuming, mind confusion
I'm tryin', there's gotta be a science to it
Is it worth the effort? I'm not an expert
Once a heckler, before the pressure
A constant battle with no winner at the end
A simple breakdown from lover to a friend
Friend to an enemy, then lover once again
It comes and goes as subtle as the wind
It comes and goes as subtle as the wind, subtle as the wind
