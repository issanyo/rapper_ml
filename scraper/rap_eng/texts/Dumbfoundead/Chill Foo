[Verse 1]
Grew up like a child star
I ain't know what the rules are
Six deep, squeezing in my mom's car
Grand Prix, we’re cruising down Crenshaw
Ice cold, just playboys with some wild hearts
World star at dive bars, let's go
How high, we’re low lives, we know
We were young, dumb and showing off for stars
Now we're legends on the boulevard

[Chorus]
Think I might be going too hard (too hard)
They tell me that I'm taking it way too far
Ain't trynna figure out
Who’s right or who’s wrong (who's wrong)
You got me fucked up
Who do you think you are
I need to chill
Nah you chill
All the homies in my face like
Chill foo chill
Nah you chill
Don’t ever tell me to chill
That's real

[Verse 2]
Talk me outta all these stupid decisions
Don’t you let me take 'em out
On you you you
Why don't you pick your poison
I’ll pick mine too
And we’ll both drink it down at the Midnight Moon
Think I'm power trippin'
Feel like a politician
Like I'm on a mission
Towards self-destruction
See no repercussion
Everything lead to cussin'
Just wanna see you buss it
I just wanna see you love me yea
But I don’t even trust myself
Never learn my lesson

[SKIT]
Don't ever tell me to chill

[Chorus]
Think I might be going to hard
They tell me that I'm taking it way too far
Ain't trynna figure out
Who’s right or who’s wrong
You got me fucked up
Who do you think you are
I need to chill
Nah you chill
All the homies in my face like
Chill fool chill
Nah you chill
Don’t ever tell me to chill
That's real
Chill fool chill
Chill fool
Chill fool chill
