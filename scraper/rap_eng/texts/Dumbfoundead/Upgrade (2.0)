[Female vocals]
Don't you
Don't (don't)
Don't you
Don't (don't)

[Dumb]
Everything in life feels Seinfeld
When you got a baddie from a Wong Kar-wai film
Couple hoes asking for my addy but
I gotta put my ass to sleep with the Nyquil

Neujunenandae jayaji
Got my main chick looking at my IG
She don’t say shit when I eat her pussy
Like a lychee ice cream
Make her hit the high keys

I swear I don’t know myself anymore (anymore)
She upgraded me up to 2.0 (2.0)
You still on that VHS video (video)
This ain't even me in my final form, girl

Really tho, really tho get yourself updated
You on that fuck beta version
Can’t bootleg my sauce
No you can’t bootleg my sauce

Where’d you find that ex guy at (Where'd you find him?)
The one that couldn’t make you climax (climax)
Let me put you on a life hack (life hack)
Get you wetter than a kayak (kayak)

The difference is analog/digital
Signal is coming so fast that its criminal
He unoriginal, I seem unusual
Does this feel new to you?
I got that 2.0

[Chorus]
Dipping in the sauce (Dippin' in the sauce)
Don’t get lost in it baby (lost in it baby)
Might slip and fall (Might slip and fall)
Them other dudes outdated (other dudes outdated)
I got that 2.0, I got that 2.0
I got that 2.0, I got that 2.0

[Dumb]
Went through hell and back in the fire
Going through my phone, who’s Maya?
Yelling through the drywall, liar
Made it through the 3 month trial
While

Everybody wanna talk shit
Everybody wanna talk
When you locked down, man you go up in stock
Terrorist hoes tryna blow up my spot
Everybody wanna talk shit
All her friends wanna call me toxic, cause I talk slick
But you get your hoes from the black market
While my bitch ride or die till she car sick
Held me down with a couch and
A credit card from Guitar Center
Man she’s awesome

Your chick ain't mine
No chick like mine
I got that 2.0, I got that 2.0
Brand new design, yours is behind (yo)

[Chorus]
Dipping in the sauce (dippin' in the sauce)
Don’t get lost in it baby (lost in it baby)
Might slip and fall (might slip and fall)
Them other dudes outdated (other dudes outdated)
I got that 2.0, I got that 2.0
I got that 2.0, I got that 2.0

[Female vocals]
Don't
Don't you (don't you)
2.0
