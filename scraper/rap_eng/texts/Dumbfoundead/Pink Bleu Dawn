[Chorus]
Think it's time that I head home
Take the keys to my car
Think it's time that I head home
Into the pink bleu dawn
Think it's time that I head home
Sleepwalk through the smog
Think it's time that I head home
Into the pink bleu dawn

[Verse 1]
Padded docking it 5 o' clock in the morning
She pussy popping and trying to get me on Maury
Ignore the one, she's a tragic Hollywood story
I done it all before, at this point it's all boring
Cut my losses, I know my limits, I think I do
A couple more I'm either in county or in the news
I drive a foreign, I don't think that you should pour it
No recollection, and all I have is recordings
Dream like the street life of ghost town
We made a movie she camera ready, now roll sound
Picture perfect now hit the curtains and slow down
They could never bring my glow down
My therapy is complete
I'm leaving you all alone, when I came in you're all in deep
We're stuck in this purgatory, but finally been released
I finally made my peace, take my keys

[Chorus]
Think it's time that I head home
Take the keys to my car
Think it's time that I head home
Into the pink bleu dawn
Think it's time that I head home
Sleepwalk through the smog
Think it's time that I head home
Into the pink bleu dawn

[Outro]
The sky's on fire
Don't get much brighter
Can't get no higher
I'm home
I'm home
The sky's on fire
Don't get much brighter
Can't get no higher
I'm home
I'm home
