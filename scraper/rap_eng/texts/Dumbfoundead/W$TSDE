[Verse 1:Dumbfoundead]
Just made a move to westside
Heard it was the best side
10 to 405, it used to be a test drive
Ridin' in my S5, TV's from Best-Buy
Girls in yoga pants, boosting up my sex drive
Ha, They know I'm a rapper or a DJ
Whole foods, in PJ's, and it's a fuckin' weekday
That dude, yea mothafucka' I'm that dude
Who's who, talkin' to my manager on blue tooth
Its unfair how the wealthy get to stay healthy
Never had these options, only Frito Lay and Nestle
Yea I'm livin' stress free, debt free, check please
Eatin' well smokin' good, what the hells a stress seed
Yea I made it out, you chose the hater route
I went it got it while you chose to sit and wait it out
Now yous a rent a cop (Cop) you kicks the skaters out
I got that westside money in my bank account

[Hook]
She came to me in a dream and sang to me
Move west young brotha'
Oohhh weeee, (right near the beach)
W$TSDE, W$TSDE, W$TSDE, W$TSDE

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
(1) fill up mamas purse, (2) then my papas wallet
(3) give my sister dollars, than I start ignorant ballin'
I see the ignorant comments, I say Hakuna Matata
That's a different language to y'all, like Gucci or Prada
I call my CPA, like whats the ETA
One call and he's over like its triple A
Yea I'm getting play, from Miss USA
She showing PDA, feeling on me TSA
Oh so Devin blowin' trees to the heavens
Debonaire with endeavors, sip a coconut beverage
As I ride through, dreams of my high school days
Where I thought it was phase, I was lied to
Rap money it wasn't a myth, when they told me it doesn't exist
Cause dozens of kids fail, they put em in retail, in front of an Intel
Or in jail, but I set sail, ya feel me

[Hook]
She came to me in a dream and sang to me
Move west young brotha'
Oohhh weeee, (right near the beach)
W$TSDE, W$TSDE, W$TSDE, W$TSDE

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]
Posted up in overland
People walking dovermans
Holding in the ocean breeze
They like there he go again
Noticing, that I'm cherishing every square foot, (there look)
Trippin' as I'm lookin' at them hippies walking bare foot
I can feel the sand from the patio
I can smell the patties from the in and out, animal style
This lifestyle and I are compatible
Trynna make my stay way longer than a cameo

Hey hey
Love from the westside, reincarnated in my next life
