[Verse 1]
Yo I'm living my dream without actually obtaining it
When you’re the shit your surrounded by peeps who never gave a shit
Pump pump your head up till the air gauge reads dangerous
Feels like your just a stair up to reaching fame and glitz
Free drinks, free weed, somebody free me
Every night is black Friday, black out in the evenings
THIS LIFE, isn’t built for the weak
It's built for the weekends, so don’t you dare sleep

[Hook]
THIS LIFE- is filled with stars, women, cars
THIS LIFE- but none of it is really ours
THIS LIFE REALLY IS COMPLICATED, ain't it though
THIS LIFE is simulated, but I still play it

[Bridge]
This is everything I've asked for
Everything I've wanted as a kid, on the dancefloor
Table full of bottles and mountains of magic powder
In an hour it's all gone to my head, dreaming from my deathbed, cause...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Put me on guestlist my name plus five, no problem getting inside
Call me the Westside messiah, get high, while playing with fire
Look at it from my POV, VIP, like GOD
Delivered to my table like COD, saying fuck you to the world Cee Lo Green
Fake smiles, shake hands, make rounds, make plans
Can't look at there soul through there raybans
Club full of sharks, hope I make it to the mainland
This life is made of 24karat gold
But it's like you in a jewelry store
And all you can do is just stare at those

[Hook]
THIS LIFE- is filled with stars, women, cars
THIS LIFE- but none of it is really ours
THIS LIFE- is filled with stars, women, cars
THIS LIFE- but none of it is really ours
