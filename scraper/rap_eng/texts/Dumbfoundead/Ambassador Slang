[Hook: Rakaa]
Ambassador slang, international range
Build bridges while we clash and bang
Ambassador slang, you don’t have to ask the name
Global with the cash and fame
Ambassador slang, connected worldwide
Understand we worldwide
Ambassador slang, international range
Build bridges while we clash and bang

[Verse 1: Tasha]
The track hit the headphones, pen hit the pad
Put emcees to sleep like tryptophan
The shit hit the fan when my shit hit the stands
Take trips to Japan, toes dipped in the sand
Tash keep it fresh like it’s zipped in a bag
I run it so smooth it don’t glitch or lag
I never snitch or brag, I just spit those facts
We put this haiku hip hop shit on the map

[Verse 2: Tiger JK]
Once again back is the incredible
All you rappers are edible, knock you off your pedestal
Better check all your medical records before you mess with a
Intoxicated Tiger, the veteran, rap professional
[?] original gun clap
Return of the boom bap, I’ll turn the moon black
[?] Korean [?]
[?] Korean [?]

[Verse 3: Roscoe Umali]
Roscoe Umali, rap Hailie Selassie
Try to knock me off but it’s highly unlikely
That I’ll ever vacate the throne, I’m too known
And you’ll never hear me say the three words “I’m too stoned”
Full-blown monster, all-out problem
No need for talk I just go out and solve it
Regardless of the artist I’m the hardest
Flawless, fresh, Filipino performance

[Verse 4: BIGRYNZ]
It’s that West Coast Shaolin with the bully brass knuckle
With a style that’ll bust you in the face and make it rumple
Just don’t fumble, I pick it up and get your brain washed
You way soft, now you hardcore, you better jump off
Or clock out, beef is what the fuck I’m about
No doubt, I get a call from Rakaa to blow the whole block out
With melodies and ill keys and dope from the Japanese
Look out for the Big Rider while you blowing them trees

[Verse 5: MOSHPIT]
It's Moshpit from the South Pacific breeze to the West Coast soil
[?] don't spoil
And wrapped with the foil and tossed in the freezer
And get chopped by the big cleaver
For fuckin' with these [?]
Be off the fucking meter
And running wild through the jungle like wild cheetahs
With hot heaters that stay with high fevers
So you're dealing with a sickness [?]

[Verse 6: Rakaa Iriscience]
Oh boy, the hammer bangs hard get shook
Dark Mandarin, vengeance like Park Chan Wook
I’m free, hit the streets and roam
Laugh and the world laughs with you, weep and you weep alone
Megaphone street sweepers on low
Microphone heat seekers we know
We can see when they glow
Megalopolis to the tropics, light a lei up
Ra-kahuna, Ra-kalolo, Ra-Kamehameha

[Verse 7: Dumbfounddead]
Yo, I carry the torch with my chariot schorchin'
I’m a gladiator battling and burying corpses
It’s very unfortunate what I do to these victims
Like Dangerous Minds gotta get through to these children
What I do to these cats, whip the gluteus maximus
Nobody fucking with me like they’re practicing abstinence
Dumb is the nastiest when I get in the zone
Eight bars like a five-forty kick to the dome

[Verse 8: Tassho Pearce]
P-lllllllat, Sho’s back off that Prozac
Throw in a little cognac, think I won’t snap?
For anyone who listenin' like a phone tap
DJ Honda just helped me get my zone back
Southside of the HI that’s my whereabouts
Family and respect about the only thing I care about
For Rakaa called me said “Sho homey air it out”
I turned into a wrecking ball, y’all can watch me tear it down

[Verse 9: Tablo]
Some people complain to the IRS
Some people put a plane through the IRS
Money makes the world nutty
But when it comes to mine
I want to see it all like an eye witness
T-A-B-L-O Let me say hi and y’all say yo
Yeah I’m burning hot like Arabian thirst
And I’ll make your shit pop like Damien Hirst

[Verse 10: Mithra Jin]
[?] Korean [?]

[Verse 11: Jay Jaballas]
I’m a man on a mission, after all the competition
PAC 10, Mack 10, automatic ammunition
Spitting that live fire, no time to retire
Spraying ‘em down, got you preaching to the choir
I’m on trial like Jim Carrey in Liar Liar
I did time in the Fed’s for knowing a supplier
So don’t try to roll with the squadrons
Midnight marauders [?]

[Verse 12: King Kapisi]
I told you before if you roll with my street team
Islanders worldwide, breaking shit like Beat Street
What up uso?, We repping the South Pacific
Screams from the Old Plantation, so get with it
It's King Kaps and Rakaa, we strapped with the machete
Let me advise you again little boy you ain’t ready
My commentary is legendary like Fab 5 Freddy
Like a coconut to the temple from the sky we’re so deadly

[Hook]
