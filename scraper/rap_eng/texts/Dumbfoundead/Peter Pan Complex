[Verse 1]
I always had me a good laugh at school
A class clown with a whole pack of Kools
What can I say? That's what bad kids do
A latch-key child that brought rappers through
Now I'm up in the office, wearing shackles, boo
At the water cooler, wanting to act a fool
I don't wanna turn the page to chapter two
Let's go back to youth cause the past was cool
But I hate to admit that it's over now
The place is filled with a much older crowd
Grab a shot of good liquor, put the soda down
Cats pull out straps, no one throws it down
I remember rapping, having loads of fun
All my friends at the Project Blowed was young
Now most of us only kick flows for funds
Paying bills became hard to overcome

[Hook]
I got a Peter Pan complex
And I don't wanna grow up, grow up, grow up
No, no, no
If I give up my youth now just consider me dead
Me dead, me dead, me dead, yeah, yeah

They tell me I'm immature and I yell at them
"So what?", "So what?", "So what?"
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It seems harder to let go the older I get
I get, I get (ha, ha, ha...)

[Verse 2]
I remember being a prodigy
I'm not special anymore, there's a lot of me's
Younger cats that are way more promising
This kind of thing, shouldn't bother me
But as you grow you start to think
Like 'Am I too old to follow dreams?'
Every day I hope that time will freeze
But the clock ain't broke, it winds with speed
You think about marriage, diamond rings
You think about carriage, a child, his needs
But I'm busy dreaming the lifestyle of kings
Falling dollars, colored olive green
Never really got into the college scene
A semester turned into an autumn fling
Most of ya'll are scared to fall it seems
Go ahead, let out your inner child and scream

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Wrinkles might form on our physical frame
But age is a number, my mental remains
I'm still entertained by the simple and plain
The summer, the fall, the winter, and spring
The older I get, the younger I feel
I still believe in that one-in-a-mil
Got sand on the beach and a castle to build
I've seen it myself and monsters are real

[Fade out with Hook]
