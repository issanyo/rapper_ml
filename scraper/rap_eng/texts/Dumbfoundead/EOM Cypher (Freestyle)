I ain't done one of these in a minute
I was busy hot-boxing, rolling trees in a Civic
Traveling overseas with all paid expenses
My face on the big screen, go see Detention
Don't get it twisted I ain't ever falling off bro
Got a surplus of bars, my flow Costco
The road is my religion and the flow is the gospel
My flow's so godly, your flows god awful
Catch me up in K-Town, hanging with bad bitches
Because they find nothing more attractive than ambition
And I'm the definition, go and ask Webster
Put my city on the map, took it past Western
It's K-Town baby, every city that I rock I yell that shit
I'mma stack mad Grammys and Adele that shit
Put my ex on a record and then sell that shit
That's some real ass shit, better tell that bitch
EOM EOM on the beat
If you're trying to battle me, just D-O-N-T
Don't do it, Don't do it mothafuckas
I know I've been gone a while
I've been out in Ghana with Dave Chappelle on a llama
Getting wiser Dalai Lama
But I'm back with a vengeance like Old Boy
But this ain't the remake by Spike Lee, no boy
I be that ignorant immigrant, tweeting like I'm 50 Cent
Jeremy Lin's evil twin, jersey number triple six
You know I've been ill since the sonogram
When I die I'm rocking with the 2Pac Hologram
