[Intro]
Yo, Duke Westlake Cypher
Here we go

[Verse]
Yo, Duke be making beats that blow fuses out of jukeboxes
Been making music since Goof Troops and juice boxes
It's naked music, cause none of y'all got nothing on us
We'll never be neck to neck; I'm a fucking brontosaurus
It's Knocksteady, we headed up to the top
'Til we pop Ciroc bottles with the homie Barack, huh
Loading up shots like a 9-millimeter
My chick hotter than a coffee shop down in Kenya
I been rocking since crawling inside a sandbox
Rolling up the shamrock like I'm from Jamrock
My grandpops' grandpops was getting mad props
Keep counting sheep, I'll turn your sheep into lamb chops
Don't sleep; an insomniac with his coffee black
I'm running over you copycats with my Pontiac
I'm body-bagging 'em, toe-tagging 'em, drop dead
Cooking classics in the lab, I'm a pothead
Mix a little David Choe and some De La Soul
And you get motherfucking Dumbfoundead, there ya go
Black liver, green lungs, and a heart of gold
The longest interview you'll ever see on Charlie Rose
All you younger kids won't understand that reference
Cause all you know is Miley Cyrus and Zac Efron
That's the truth, and I'll tell ya, with no hesitation
Got love for the youth, but I hate your generation
Yeah, I said it; one take, no edits
Got a flow fetish, make it look oh-so effortless
DFD, I hope you know who you're messing with
Why you hating so much when your girl's so affectionate?
My stock rising at an exponential speed
From residential streets to the Presidential Suite
Yeah, now that my record is released
Go and buy that motherfucker so I can get me some weed
Yeah

[Outro]
Duke Westlake Cypher
I'm gonna call out Palmer Squares
Get your bars up
Peace!
