[Verse 1]
Time passing feels crazy but i'll always be your baby boy
Where ever life takes me, i know one day imma make you proud
I know its kinda ruff now but you don't gotta worry no more
We bout to live it up now, i knew one day we would make you proud

[Chorus]
I said hey there, i know it feels so long now trying to get this thing right
Maybe i won't today, but i know one day imma make you proud
I said hey there, i know it feels so long now trying to get this thing right
Maybe i won't today, but i know one day imma make you proud
One day imma make you proud

[Verse 2]
I know i've done some dumb things and made a couple bad choices but I
Do know one thing, i won't give up till i make you proud
Some say it's the wrong way but its the only way i wanna go
Taking off on the runway now, imma spread my wings and make you proud

[Verse 2 - Rap]
A wise man once told me don't
Ever try to be the richest man around the world
Instead strive to be the greatest at the things you do
Eventually you'll see the money will just come to you
You gotta fall on to your face a couple thousand times
And when you get up you'll be stronger with a harder grind
Keep on working you should know that nothings owed to you
Even if it feels over due

[Chorus]
I said hey there, i know it feels so long now trying to get this thing right
Maybe i won't today, but i know one day imma make you proud
I said hey there, i know it feels so long now trying to get this thing right
Maybe i won't today, but i know one day imma make you proud
One day imma make you proud
One day imma make you proud

[Bridge]
Sometimes this dream feels oh so far away (so far away)
But one day we gonna shine like sunny days (okay)

[Final Chorus]
One day imma make you proud
I said hey there, i know it feels so long now trying to get this thing right
Maybe i won't today, but i know one day imma make you proud
I said hey there, i know it feels so long now trying to get this thing right
Maybe i won't today, but i know one day imma make you proud
One day imma make you proud
