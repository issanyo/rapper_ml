[Hook]
Hey, let's get one thing clear
I want a new life, a new life
Hey, lets get one thing clear;
There’s much more stardust, when you’re near

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Just woke up, what I miss?
Smoke one up in the morning
Fell asleep with the tv on
And had me dreams of being on Conan
Yea I'm zonin', hit that shower
With my new girl for an hour (for an hour?)
Fuck the neighbors
Last few nights man, we were louder

Got my bags packed, and my passport
Didn't unpack from the last tour
Sold my merch
I made me bank and I ain't talkin' backboard
Stack more, stack more
Shoulda wrote that on that blackboard
What the fuck is school for
If you end up livin' mad poor?

That GPA don't matter when you're climbin' up my ladder
They will stab you with that dagger
For your status, do you gather?
What you did and how you did it, no one gives a fuck at all
Where you going, how you get it, you should focus on that mo'

I'm on that brand new, that old shit I put that in the attic
Neck and wrist got 24 karats
I'm one happy rabbit
All that talk about your talent is as old as my machallan
Lets see a lot more action and less talkin' Charlie Chaplin

Hey, let's get one thing clear
I want a new life, a new life
Hey, lets get one thing clear
There much more stars, coming in

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Hey, where you hidin', I'm writin'
My future, on a diamond
I'm Johnny, I'm Manziel, that freshman with the Heisman
I'm Malcolm I'm Gladwell, that tipping point, is risin'
Real life movie streets are watching', like a drive in

5 stars, masterpiece, got the critics ravin'
Fly far, Master P, theres no limitations
First class, never knew they gave 'em all this extra shit
You can lean your seat back all the way, on some stretcher shit

Too good, life is too good, when your livin'
Its that HD vision no more fuckin' with antennas
Ha, I'm just buyin' now
Got more hoes than a firehouse
Way more O's in my bank account
It looks like I been buyin' vowels

I'm dinin' out
No need for reservations
All originals
Used to rock them imitations
Bought from Chinatown, (town)
And them hand me downs, (downs)
I'm lookin' dapper, ain't ever getting patted down

Hey, let's get one thing clear
I want a new life, a new life
Hey, lets get one thing clear
There’s much more stardust, when you’re near

Hey, let's get one thing clear
I want a new life, a new life
Hey, lets get one thing clear
There’s much more stardust, when you’re near
