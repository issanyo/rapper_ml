Groupies on my jock, they telling me to break a leg
Everytime I rock, they get horny give me satan head
These hoes get Emily Rose, try to break the bed
Always rock the glove, got that Gary Payton cred
New town everynight, I'mma paint it red
Wake up to a new chick, huge tits, making eggs
Gotta break fast, theres a flight to catch
She got issues, her boyfriend got biker tats
What kind of life is that? mommas try to preach
All I hear is womp womp another onomatopoeias
I should really listen, dealing with sleazy women
Chatting over salads at the california pizza kitchen
Twenty twenty vision, going on blind dates
Looking for wifey, running through bridesmaids
Always the same conversation with the lines change
Fine with the mind states, fly with the time change

[DFD & Intuition]

Yeah, we 'bout to get rich soon
Roll another spliff and lets get lit foo
Waking up, looking at my wrist it's noon
Feeling like I might tic tic tic boom, boom (2x)

[Intuition]

I set the flow so prison cell
Wave to them haters, go ahead wishin' em' well
No longer throwin pennies in the wishing well
Spending every evening with a breezy playing kiss and tell
Finished off a fifth, now im sippin ale
Steady going postal box, costal trying to get the mail
Mister Dick Nixon and flyer than a pigeon tail
Waving peace sign hustlerin a politician shells
Spent nights rippin rails, runny nose sick as hell
Now I puff a spliff untill my bottom lip is swell
Shake it, stir it, just mix it well
I'mma chug it down like the last cold drink in hell
How ya livin' man? Im feelin swell
Even with a nervous twitch, nibblin on brittle nails
And press strangers with little fib riddle tale
Just keep weighting till my weight tips the scale

[DFD & Intuition]

Yeah, we 'bout to get rich soon
Roll another spliff and lets get lit foo
Waking up, looking at my wrist it's noon
Feeling like I might tic tic tic boom, boom (2x)
