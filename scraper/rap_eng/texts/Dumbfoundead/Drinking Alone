[Intro]
Drinking all alone
“Feeling” like an outcast
Going through my phone
Looking for a quick smash

[Hook: Breezy Lovejoy]
Drink me down to the last call
And hold me down because I can’t walk
I hate the feeling being thirsty
So make me feel like you want me
And ohhh this bottle I should
Just leave it alone I shouldn't
Be drinking at all

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
You bringing out the worst in me
Bringing out the thirst in me
Burping off THE BOURBON, WRITING verses sounding nursery
Slurrin' while I’m cursing, LIKE Why the fuck are you hurting ME
Fuck it you ain’t worth it, I’m invincible I’m Hercules
She ask me why I’m calling then
Advises me to go to sleep
It’s a problem when you’re drunk you're
Bummping Jodeci sober in the morning
Still horney it’s like I need some help
Looking at my twitter did I really
Play myself, not again
I can’t keep the bottled in
Pinot grigio got me emo like
No common sense, take my phone
I need some self-control
All this drinking drinking
Got me in my zone
I know I’m wrong

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Yo, it’s always after two
When I’ll be texting you
Saying something casual
To make not sexual
You Know what it is
You ain't a stupid chick
I’m just punching in for
After hours functioning
Like how I’m STYLING on you?
Drunk dialing on you?
Malibu and Pineapple
Getting Island on you?
Feeling thirsty and
I’m trying to get hydrated
Holla at your boy
And you’re trying to
Get violated
Pupils getting dilated
I’m a annihilated
Sending out hi baby’s
With a little smiley face
Girl come by my place
And take another shot
I ain't a player
I just crush a lot

[Verse 1: Breezy Lovejoy]
Saying the night is over
Ever fall from sober?
Take a ride in this taxi
And maybe I can sleep over?
Say what you doing

[Repeat: x4]
What you doing
What you doing
What you doing girl?

[Hook]

[Outro: x4]
Drinking all alone
“Feeling” like an outcast
Going through my phone
Looking for a quick smash
