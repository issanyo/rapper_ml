[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Playing catch with a molotov cocktail
90s baby can you not tell?
Raised in the midst of the riots
While the pigs staying cozy off of Sawtelle
OJ on the hot trail
With the all white bronco
Yellow baby with the snot nose
Was a bad ass kid with a lip should've gone on a talk show Pronto pronto
I was born to be an OG
Had like 15 Dickies with creases
Fucking bitches on bleachers
Esthers, Graces, and Keishas
Riding down Normandie, Warren G
Was a clear black not a clear white move
Bet you never knew that little Dummy might do it
Imma live forever like the mummy in the ruins cause

[Hook 1: Dumbfoundead]
When I die
I'm a god
Paint me large
On the wall

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Paint my face on the side
Of the liquor store when I die
The one on Catalina up on 8th street
Paint me I wanna be immortalized
Young boy from the K
Yeah my momma had faith
She was praying for my californication
Daddy putting in the work, both hands full of dirt
Fingers looking like them California raisins
My parents ain't raised no fool but a legend
They studied me at school as a lesson
After UCs with the Bruce Lees we at 2G's
You should listen to 'em for some wisdom
Nah I ain't on one
I just never owned nothing
Feeling like the good son
I ain't ready to go but

[Bridge: Dumbfoundead]
What's good tonight? (What's good)
Everything is good when the hood stay quiet
Pass the light (pass the light)
Light this bitch up like the '92 riots
Where's the ice? (Where's the ice)
Drank in my cup and toast to the Mayans
Here's to life (here's to life)
Plan to live a long time and for when I die
