[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Dead silent, rush hour drivin
Got a Honda civic with 5 dudes inside it
With no tunes, it feels like an asylum
I'm growin violent as I cover more mileage
A couple months back we went to catch a concert
In a sketchy neighborhood, it was gonna be bonkers
25 bucks just to park in the lot
The homies said "what a rip off That's fuckin a lot"
So I parked on Alvarado street, avoiding all the parking fees
You ain't gotta tell me shit, I know it wasn't smart of me
Not to mention walking to the venue was an odyssey
I was being hella cheap, blame the damn economy
After the show heading back to whip
We saw the aftermath of what the crackhead did
Broken glass, if I catch him Ima whoop that ass
Hes probably smoking crack with my speakers on blast, fuck

[Hook: Ehwhenkeem]
Weeks and months I've drove this lonely road
All I hears the air conditioner as it blows (as it blows)
Some time ago, a crack head broke both my windows and bounced
Now my weed, my sneakers my JBL speakers
No where to be found, GIVE ME BACK MY STEREO, MY PRECIOUS STEREO

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
He took all my albums from 93 till
Wu-tang, de la, hov, lauryn hill
Bet hes bumpin Underground kings getting trill
Outkast and yeezy man what a steal
Jacked both my speakers and all my ipods
So many mp3's that I had to buy five
All adding up to bout 500 gigs
Took years to build a music collection that big
He haunts me in my dreams, with headphones on
Scratchin up cds, and deleting my songs
Then I wake up in cold sweat, just feelin so vexed
Yelling out "motherfucker that isn't yo shit"
Music is my crack, give me that crack back
Give me my stuff back, I'll buy you a crack sack
How can people in this world be so cold
When he took my stereo he took a piece of my soul

[Hook: Ehwhenkeem]
Weeks and months I've drove this lonely road
All I hears the air conditioner as it blows (as it blows)
Some time ago, a crack head broke both my windows and bounced
Now my weed, my sneakers my JBL speakers
No where to be found, GIVE ME BACK MY STEREO, MY PRECIOUS STEREO

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]
Man, girls ain't even wanna ride in my whip now
The homies kick down gas money with big frowns
Bangin on the dashboard, hopin to entertain
Kickin quick freestyles, but it just ain't the same
Every car ride awkward as fuck
Somebody always small talkin you up, man this sucks
Whoever said silence is golden, I'm sure
Ain't never been on the 405 around 4
Paranoind, without an ounce of trust left, (left)
Everybody is a thief or a suspect
Whats a car without a bangin ass system
That's like a car without a good transmission
I would tune into a shitty station
Or even play a demo tape that I would've wasted
I swear this is karma for pirating the music
If I just get my stereo back I'll never do it
