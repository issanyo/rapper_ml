[Intro]
This is magical!
Oh wow! Look at this!

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]

Yeah
Rest in peace Huell Houser,
You repped Cali better than most
I rolled a fatty up in your honor
And blew out the Netherlands smoke
Now now now, let the evidence show
That I'm a veteran down to the bone (bone)
Check the measurements, peep my residence
Let the councilmen know (know)

Corduroy house slippers (slippers)
Polaroid fan pictures
Baby sister, held by mama
Daddy holding 80's liquor,
Never had a baby sitter, would've fucked my babysitter (sitter)
Rolled around my block with a crew of crazy sinners

Grew up on hopito, hot cheetos, and lots of kilos
I saw eagles turn our trios to duos then down to solo
Yeah we lost one, we lost two
They shot Richard, they got Drew
We lit candles and made shirts
We made sure that they're moms cool (true)
That was '02, that was 10 years ago
When I started rhyming and overused the word "lyrical"

[Bridge]
Damn that was bad, damn that was way back (back)
I got way better, how'd you fucking stay wack? (wack)
Damn that was bad, damn that was way back
Damn that was bad, damn that was way back
Damn that was bad, damn that was way back
I got way better, how'd you fucking stay wack?

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]

Man I served fools, and filled shoes, from sunset to mildew
I walked about like forty blocks, through bright reds and dark blues
Leimert Park, my rap school, they rap fast and pack tools
You rap wack, then come back, you will get your ass booed

Fast food and swisher sweets, through bulletproof glass (glass)
Hoodrats, pajama pants with a big ol' ass (ass)
First thing my friend asked "I'd smash, would you smash?"
We both laughed, we both smashed
Then passed her off to our young lads
Little bruh, the young homies, going around being unholy

Sneaking into Samâ€™s Hofbrau
If I had some ones on me, lap dance
She'd feel around, like I might have some guns on me
All the girls we messed around with
Nah, they weren't no nuns homie (nah)
That was '05, when my homie had a son (son)
I was telling every girl she the only one

Dam that was cold, damn that was old times
Used to fool around with hoes that would go the whole 9
Damn that was cold, damn that was old times
Damn that was cold, damn that was old times
Damn that was cold, damn that was old times
Used to fool around with hoes that would go the whole 9

Oh wow!
