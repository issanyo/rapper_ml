[Intro: Gaeko]
Yeah
Mhm
Yeah (x5)

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Yo
Yo I'm looking for a girl that I can start a new life with
But always end up stuck with a party-all-night chick
She bad, I just wanna kick it at the pad
But she love going out, she got a short attention span

If she'd just put her iPhone down, then she would notice
That she had somebody lifelong down, but she don't want it
Getting texts every minute, so affection is limited
Not to mention we ain't have sex in a minute

My bad, that's too much information I know
But that's the only I really know how to move on
Since neither of us are willing to admit that we're wrong
We're taking two Ls, call it a loss, and I'm gone

[Hook: Gaeko] (Translated from Korean)
Oh you and I, we could've been a better two
Oh you and I, unexplainable by me and you
Oh you and I, we could've been so good, yeah

[Verse 2: Choiza] (Translated from Korean)
Been lost for such a long time
Looked for love in that loneliness of mine
But now I know it's useless, expectations were too high
My happiness rested on others and not I

Was bugging, drunk on solitude, quick to blame fate all the while, struggling
Broke peace like dishes, an attention-craving child, now I know I took love, kept it inside me and looked far off above
Love is an eye that you and I look through as one
The mind's heaven that bridges division

[Hook: Gaeko] (Translated from Korean)
Oh you and I, we could've been a better two
Oh you and I, unexplainable by me and you
Oh you and I, we could've been so good, yeah

[Verse 3: Kero One]
Yo
I wrestle cupid for heartbreak and agony
So often, I'd rather gather fellows who Facebook added me
Oh, no homo, girls, I be bagging like Frodo, though rolling solo in Soho with half a sandwich from Togo's

Why, I need a woman with low miles, I can show mom
Nice paint job coat on with a V8 I can dote on
So go on, and stay away from all that penis
Unless you want STD's and a fetus before he's leaving

Weaving through traffic laughing about all the ass he's been tapping
While you home packing him lunches with love letters on napkins
Ouch, one hell of a douche, to tell you the truth
I've known a few gentlemen too peddling smooth moves
Whatchu gonna do?

[Hook: Gaeko] (Translated from Korean)
Oh you and I, we could've been a better two
Oh you and I, unexplainable by me and you
Oh you and I, we could've been so good, yeah

[Outro: Dumbfoundead] (Translated from Korean)
Hello, bro?
Sorry for calling you so late
I'm having problems with my girlfriend right now, damn...
I have ninety nine problems and they're all girl problems
My head seriously hurts, it's crazy over here
She just broke my computer and MPC
Korean girls are headaches
Seriously, I want to date Latinas again, damn
I got a terrible migraine right now
Sorry bro, go back to sleep
I'll call you tomorrow, bye
