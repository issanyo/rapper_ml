Hangul

저기요 물 좀 주세요

잠깐
So no baby I ain't havin' no babies, baby baby no
오 땀나
And if I'm cold baby, at least I let these bitches know baby
다들 목말라
물물물물물물
다들 목말라
물물물물물물

목말라? 오빠 손잡아
Make my way through the club like I’m Moses bruh
She stick her hands down my pocket 야 뭘 만져
Don’t touch them gold diggers, 빨리 손 닦어

Where my AZNs smoking while they pop a squat
In Korea looking for a decent taco spot
Where my pretty mamas, pretty mamas 만나자
Why you with that 촌놈, 아 너무 아깝다

어머 어머, ya boys on the come up
My whole teams eating, you struggling for 저녁
Pull up pull up, stress 풀어
Clean up on aisle 4, girl, I'll wet you up, (splash)

잠깐
So no baby I ain't havin' no babies, baby baby no
오 땀나
And if I'm cold baby, at least I let these bitches know baby
다들 목말라
물물물물물물
다들 목말라
물물물물물물

She want a wedding dress, but I ain't 태양
Had to hit her with the cross over A.I.,
Tryna put her in a taxi but its 예약
I won’t ever see her but I tell her 내일 봐

Number 1 on Naver
Rollin with my day ones
Cruising down Itaewon
Tryna kick it K1
BORN CTZN you can check the passport
I’m a boss, too much sauce on the dance floor

What it cost, 가격 물어 보지마
What it cost, what it cost
Boy, I spend that on my draws
Yea I can make it rain like
I’m with loopy and the squad
물 좀 더 주세요
Don’t go chasing waterfalls, (splash)

잠깐
So no baby I ain't havin' no babies, baby baby no
오 땀나
And if I'm cold baby, at least I let these bitches know baby
다들 목말라
물물물물물물
다들 목말라
물물물물물물

Come and swim baby
Yeah the water feels fine
Come and swim baby
I said the water feels fine
Come and swim baby
Yeah the water feels fine
Come and swim baby
Turn water into wine
