[Intro]
3 2 1...lift off!

[Chorus]
Rocket Man drop a hundred grand
Rocket Man got your man
Rocket Man fly to Japan
Rocket Man he don't have a land
Rocket (Rocket Man)
Man (Rocket Man)
Rocket (Rocket Man)

Rocket Man never out of gas
Rocket Man blew another bag
Rocket Man bitch too bad
Rocket Man whip too fast
Rocket (Rocket Man)

[Verse 1]
Rocket Man rocks in my pocket man
Diamonds they dripping like Aquaman
My life sweet like a chocolate
I do not fuck with them operatives
Think I might start a monopoly, ooh
Think I might buy me an ivy league school
Mom couldn't buy me the popular shoes
Now I can get her a proper masseuse
I'm on a whole 'nother league
Money on level Vegeta (Super Saiyan)
You are not who they believe
Faking like you were Madea (I'm just saying)
I'ma fuck up all the beans
Trying to make peace in Korea ([?])
Got me a bitch like Khaleesi
Freaky like Mia Khalifa
Oh my God, Rocket Man
Smoking like it's Rotterdam
New whip, dashboard hologram
Overpriced, like it's Big Baller Brand
Roll the dice, this shit might get out of hand

[Chorus]
Rocket Man drop a hundred grand
Rocket Man got your man
Rocket Man fly to Japan
Rocket Man he don't have a land
Rocket (Rocket Man)
Man (Rocket Man)
Rocket (Rocket Man)
Man
Rocket Man Rocket Man Rocket Man
Rocket
Man

Rocket Man never out of gas
Rocket Man blew another bag
Rocket Man bitch too bad
Rocket Man whip too fast
Rocket (Rocket Man)
Man (Rocket Man)
Rocket (Rocket Man)
Man
Rocket Man Rocket Man Rocket Man
Rocket
Man

[Interlude: Donald Trump]
Rocket Man should've been handled a long time ago.. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself, and for his regime

[Verse 2]
(Vroom!) I might just valet park my rari on the
(Moon!) I might just throw a ratchet party in my
(Room!) She call me daddy, daddy issues Kim Jong
(Un!) I'm with my crew, with my crew, yeah
Shut your mouth, fuck the clout
Upper echelon, up the clouds
Yeah I dicked her down, wipe her down
Yeah she busted wide, world renowned
Don't put her on a pedestal
I put her on a better view
Put her in some better shoes
Now she's making better moves
VVS's on her ring bezel
You are way under the sea level
Going up 'til I hit falsetto
They say my flow is on God level
God level? God level
I am not fucking with y'all devils
You cannot bring me to y'all level
I've got it covered on all levels

[Chorus]
Rocket Man drop a hundred grand
Rocket Man got your man
Rocket Man fly to Japan
Rocket Man he don't have a land
Rocket (Rocket Man)
Man (Rocket Man)
Rocket (Rocket Man)
Man
Rocket Man Rocket Man Rocket Man
Rocket
Man

Rocket Man never out of gas
Rocket Man blew another bag
Rocket Man bitch too bad
Rocket Man whip too fast
Rocket (Rocket Man)
Man (Rocket Man)
Rocket (Rocket Man)

Rocket Man Rocket Man Rocket Man
Rocket
