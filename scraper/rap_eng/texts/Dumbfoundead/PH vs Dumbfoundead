[Round 1: Dumbfoundead]
First of all, Pumpkinhead is a gay ass name
That shit is way past lame
You and Superhead got the same last name
Yo, y'all know the part in Cinderella
How at night the coach turned back into a pumpkin?
Well an hour later the pumpkin turned into a fat Puerto Rican
I saw pictures of him with his family over
Eating platanos with Rosie Perez, Rheteric and Sammy Sosa
What a bunch
Did y'all know this ugly punk is Big Pun's little brother, Chubby Pump'?
Yo, you think I'm dissing your people in a major way
But you're the one who ditched the Puerto Rican Day Parade for the Gay Parade
Over there everyone likes to dance, wearing bright pink pants And loves Smashing Pumpkins like the 90's band
Think he down with the youth wearing 90's brands
Rocking baggy overalls doing a 90's dance
Yo, he says being from the streets is something you forgot
But don't worry y'all, he's still- he's still Pumpkin From The Block
I saw that last video blog where he challenged me and I accepted
You said you had mad love for me and I was someone you respected
You looked real gay eating that ice cream and saying it like you meant it
On Youtube PHGTNY president's blog 2:56 seconds

[Round 1: PH]
You...are about to get your ass whipped
Your facial features, match with that of a catfish
Not the nose or the eyes so much
But your cheeks and that stringy ass mustache...bitch
To think I can't switch and match wits, I
Bash his eye, give him a Fatlip and y'all can watch as
This win passes him by like the Pharcyde on a Bizarre Ride
You look like a bum that's been squatting outside of soup kitchens
Growing up with dreams of joining up with the Fu-Schnickens
Until you found out they weren't Asian
Then you felt like you was mocked, started listening to 'Pac
But all the thugs dissed you
I hit with the power of Shaq so it ain't nothing for me to Chip-Fu
And this fool be talking Spanish trying to get love from my people
[Spanish]
I'll stomp you through the [?] 'til you're the same consistency of soup...miso
And you had the nerve to diss The Saurus's acne?
When your face look like raw packed meat
And athlete's cracked feet after running a track meet
Hold up I got a better comparison
A steroid's users ass cheeks
And if you ain't know
Dumbfoundead's real name is Jonathan Park
But we all know Asian's can't drive so Jonathan parks

[Round 2: Dumbfoundead]
Yo, that first round was a weird display
You've been rapping 30 years to date
I'm surprised you didn't start your round with "My name is Big P and I'm here to say"
I can tell from your style that you've clearly aged
Dear PH, I should be running the New York division, sincerely Jaze
I remember when you and Jaze would host battles
We all thought you were both assholes
What were y'all supposed to be? The Lethal Weapon of Grind Time?
Hosting is a one man job Einstein
Yo, I wouldn't be surprised if you were out doing E
A faggot rapper, this pumpkin is a jack-o-lantern with a mouth full of seeds
Yo, you can't keep busting rhymes
You either gonna fucking die, get drunk and high with sunken eyes
Or end up as a tranny named "Pumpkin Pie"
You gotta stop rapping, become a counselor or an English teacher
Looking like King Latifah
By the way, your video blogs are boring as fuck when you get all personal
Bitching about Jaze and how you like to work alone
I didn't know they allowed the Internet at the nursing home
He don't go nowhere without his medication and respiration tank
Grind Time should be excavating greats not this Pumpkin that's past it's expiration date
PH, I'm perpetuating hate
I'm burning this asshole, you should've had more Preparation, H

[Round 2: PH]
I wanna thank Dumb for having the wackest, poorest flow
Meeting up with Bill Clinton and letting them two reporters go
See, Kim Jong Ill could get his wigwam peeled
You're not on your job, sleeping on my bars
Now you know how Rick Ross feels
What? You thought I wasn't gonna come to Cali and bomb you?
You undercover cross dresser
I bet all his fan letters start with "To Wong Foo"
[?] your girlfriend's a [?]
It's ironic that you suck and she [?]
Booya!

{​​​​​Chokes}​​​​​

I gotta admit, you had a good ole' run
But after this shit, your battle career's done
See Thirsty Fishes like to have Fun With Dumb
Mic Eagle get's him open putting his thumb in dumb
Yo, I'll bash this maggot and his wack clique with a back fist
I'm not talking about uploading pics online when I say I Snapfish
I'll punch ya, cut ya, with a lumberjack flow
His chick is a Thunder, Thunder, Thundercat Ho!
Ayo, I would've put the beats on mama
And my fam' was like "Damn" how she ran that pussy fast like [?]
But I had to stomp her, when the panties came down I damn near barf
Cause I ain't know if it was pussy or alien, I had to call that "snarf"
I don't mean to diss ya, I know you be in motion pictures
He been in mad versions of Godzilla
And played the baby in Tropic Thunder that stabbed Ben Stiller

[Round 3: Dumbfoundead]
You old as fuck with outdated pop references
Hey be calling soda "pop beverages"
I should just sit this one out and let my pops settle this
I wish you died and the king of pop never did
I know you're older but I'm better at this rap shit
You're a veteran of wackness
I'm gonna explain to y'all how big this generation gap is
I was recently in the Fresh Coast DVD Bonus Features
You were in Wild Style when it was shown in theaters
Yo, he rocks throw back jerseys, not cause he's trying to
When he originally bought those, those players were kinda new
Yo, I used to play Super Mario Brothers in the arcade
You used to play Super Mario Brothers the board game
I know your history
You joined the Brooklyn Academy after you got fired from cooking at Applebees for hooking up family
I know you used to make tracks with 2Mex and had a crew with him called 2 Necks
And I know you been rapping with Jean Grae and got left by more than half of your team mates
For acting like a faggot, spelled with a capital PH
And I know the east coast might not like me after this
But I hope y'all still do
Even though I just murdered your president; John Wilkes Booth

[Round 3: Pumpkinhead]
See, Dumb be missing out on battles, I think he be petro
Last Battle Of The Bay, him and Sat' missed out on a battle with Real Deal and Fresco
Supposedly their car got impounded but what's really insane
Is that they still didn't show up after Lush offered to put 'em on a plane
All expenses paid
Wait, there's more
Grizzlemania came
You was supposed to battle Collide but didn't due to going out on tour
Which, as an artist, I can respect, but then Kap got upset never happened and you never went
If I was Lush and Kap I would've been told you to "fuck off"
No wonder your favorite condiment is duck sauce
Dumb is a dodo, I'll fuck up this mofo
He's a Korean, you can clearly see he wants to be cholo
He thinks he's loco
Rocks his locs low, buttons one button at the top of his shirt and talks slow like
"Hey holmes. Sup' little puppet."
Lyricflip looks at him like, "Yo, you not Chicano you dumb bitch!"
Ayo, you remember them Taco Bell commercials where the dog try to get you put down the food bro
Well in reverse, I had to coerce Dumbfoundead to put down the Chihuahua instead of the chalupa
Yo, any woman that fucks with you, I call that a Dumb fuck
I punch you in the face, we'll call that Dumb struck
And the only way he winning this battle is if all five judges is Leprechauns and we'll call that Dumb luck

{​​​Overtime}​​​

[Round 4: Dumbfoundead]
You've been served in every era, what are you a time traveler?
You're like the Highlander rhyme battler
He went on Youtube and pulled up all my battling clips
With him I have to find the last film reel that exists and project it off some Charlie Chaplin shit
Yo, you so old you were in the first ever silent battle
Now you're out here yelling like a violent mammal in a Grind Time battle
And I'll abuse this old bitch like a movie on the Lifetime Channel
I will slap his pumpkin face and leave him with a pumpkin patch
You're fucking fat, you need to pump some iron and do some Pumpkin jacks
I was gonna put some money up for this battle but this dude ain't worth the penny
He's just another average rapper and believe me I've murked me plenty
I haven't served a senior citizen since I worked at Dennys
Yo, you were supposed to be one of the leaders of the new school
But ended up being a bottom feeder up on Youtube
Man, you still rocking Fubu?
These old jokes never get old...but you do
It's alright PH cause 40 is the new 30
But you need to start moving around
Cause 300 pounds isn't the new 200 pounds
Alright Mr. Underground it's time to come outta the ground
Cause while your friends were putting in work you were Lyricist Lounging around
It's alright, I seen your peers perform at Rock The Bells
I seen you in your uniform at Taco Bell
They're doing mad tours, stamps on their passport
While you're living mad poor, food stamps in your cash drawer
They're letting champagne bottles pop after signing deals
You at Santana's Auto Shop aligning wheels
It's all good, I couldn't believe it when this dude sent me a challenge
I was like is it because the dude is mentally challenged?
I rep for Los Angeles the city of angels
And I'll run through your whole crew and leave your division with halos

[Round 4: PH]
You facing the first generation underground legend, I'm about to air you out
You're part of the second generation of Project Blowdians, nobody gives a fuck about
Myka passed me the 9 and told me you wasn't his friend
So I went to your crib, turned the radio up to Volume 10
Put the hot potato on the barrel to muffle the sound
He wasn't there so I stole his Pinkberry t-shirt, I knew that would ruffle you now
Aceyalone, that's my homie so I gotta shout him out
But your nuts ain't drop yet, so it's true what Aceyalone said, All Balls Don't Bounce
I'll smack this fool back to Catmando
You should've rehearsed for this battle instead of doing album commercials for Abstract Rude
Yo, Fredo, frankly I think you chewed this motherfucker, so I'ma spit in his face
[?] motherfucka
You a stupid motherfucka
I should shoot ya and then punch ya
I bet Medusa used to punk ya to do her acupuncture
