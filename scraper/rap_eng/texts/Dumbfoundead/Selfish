Instrumental from Miguel's Sure Thing

Lyrics:

Its 1 am on a Wednesday and I swear im with the baddest chick
Its been months and she ain't question what are status is
I know her g spot, but I don't really know her
And she don't really know me, except I like it slower
I drink nightly till my vision is a blur
Party till it hurts, now my card is in her purse
Wake up to something that only started with a flirt
Been down this road before, you swear my car was in reverse

Before this girl it was her, and with her I was sure
Till I learned there was no such thing
Now I find myself messin with girls with low self esteem
Heres the person that you painted me to be

A selfish man, im a selfish man, this song was about you
Now its about me, livin without you, ain't hard as I thought it be

A sefish man, im a selfish man, girl you were good, the new one is better
She fell for it all, all the bullshit I fed her

The rules I don't need em, a fool for this freedom
Gave up what I had, true love for convenience
Let it go let it go let it go girl let it go let it go let it go girl

All the problems you had with me go and air it out
Those are problems that this new girl don't care about
Ya we keep everything on the surface
Ignorance is bliss, and this is damn near perfect
I needed part time love, wasn't fit for a career
Call my dark side up, and tell her to bring a blunt, it feels better when we fuck
I get mine, she gets hers there will never be an us, im
A selfish man, a selfish man, this song was about you now its about me, livin without you, ain't hard as I thought it be
A sefish man, im a selfish man, girl you were good, the new one is better, she fell for it all, all the bullshit I fed her

The rules I don't need em, a fool for the freedom
Gave up what I had, true love for convenience
Let it go let it go let it go girl let it go let it go let it go girl

I sleep around like im trynna get revenge, hoping that you'll hurt, but you don't even flinch
Seen you with your new mans im glad you found your prince, I know his kind I smell the stench

Of a selfish man, a selfish man, this song was about you now its about me
Livin without you, ain't hard as I thought it be

A sefish man, im a selfish man, girl you were good, the new one is better
She fell for it all, all the bullshit I fed her
