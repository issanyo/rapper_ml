[Verse 1:]

You know the usual girl, I'll take it on the rocks
You can catch me here every night like I'm on the clock
I know this neighborhood and all the local mom and pops
We own these blocks like prisoners that were on the rock
But this ain't Alcatraz, this is an alkie trap
Bar hoppers and big talkers and starting tabs
Hand shakes with fake smiles and shark attacks
Networking and head jerk gettin lots of crap
Huh, some of these cats I went to school with 'em
Run into 'em they be telling me that I'm doing it
They give me props, but it's hard to find the truth in it
Green bottles in hand with devils juice in 'em
Sixth street down six feet we digging deep
Like we own the place, know my face, get in free
The wasted minutes of our lives is the hidden fee
But who am I to preach

[Hook]

Yeah they know me around here
Call me the hometown hero
Holla when I roll down Pico
Let's get another round here
Homie drinks on me
Because you know I get them drinks for free

Girl you ain't from around here
And that's probably a good thing
Because I ain't trying to mess up a good thing
This is my town here
As much as I love it I wanna leave
But this town won't set me free

[Verse 2:]

I seen them younguns they tatted with town pride
With not the slightest clue what's happening outside
Saying that they run shit, fighting about dumb shit
When they not one fifth of the man, ain't that some shit
We live our lives on the fly, we just roll the dice
With no idea you're a grain in the bowl of rice
The OGs told me nothing no advice
My closest friends left me hanging on the coldest nights
Where the women and pretty linen are overpriced
Gold diggers, their goal's becoming trophy wives
Tell me how that easy money make you feel girl
It's gon' be painful when you come into the real world
I ain't lying you a dime though
But you're drinking yourself down to a five though
Going out every night, you a wine-o
The same faces all the places that I go

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]

I took a break then came back, ain't nothing changed
The same cats from way back, oh what's his name?
Big homie in his late 20s clutching canes
Old girl, who been known to do them slutty things
I seen the parts of the world that some would never reach
This town will anchor you down, and never set you free
They said a local legend is the most I'll ever be
Until I put my town on the map, for everyone to see
Here I am y'all, I got a lot to share
I ain't telling made up stories on my rocking chair
I see you there trying so hard not to care
You saying that you wanna go far, but you're scared
Nah brotha, it don't work like that
You took a step out and took the first flight back
I guess some of us are just cursed like that
But I wasn't birthed like that

[Hook]
