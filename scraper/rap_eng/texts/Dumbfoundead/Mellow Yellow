[INTRO]
I'ma keep it G real
I don't fuck with you cuz you disrespecting me
You disrespecting my hood by telling me
Take off my flag I don't see how gangsta I was nigga
You lucky on that day I was acting cool cuz
I told you I ain't got time for that my nigga
Today I got time cuz!

[SAMPLE: STUTTERING KID]
That, that you um, you have, you you would, you could, you do, you w-, you want

[INTRO CONT'D]
My nigga you came up on me off some funk shit nigga
I don't make peace with niggas
I come up on me with some disrespectful shit
When I didn't even know you niggas...

[HOOK]
I don't know you motherfuckers
I'm off the soju motherfuckers
They call me mellow yellow
Yeah I'm rolling cigarillos

[VERSE 1]
I see your parents are worried you're fucking with yellow boys now (걱정하지마)
Tell 'em that they should be worried I'm thinking of hanging around (아무데도 안가)
(They call me mellow yellow)

Y'all know me
Still the same OG, better Venmo me
For that eight ball that you picked up last week dog
You gonna learn like a Leap Frog
My people love me like FIFA
I be rolling with a hella hella deep squad
Asian bitches with the booty doing knee squats
Always banging with the colour-striped knee socks
Where the fuck you from?
Grew up in a swap meet, fake Versace
So I could give a fuck about your fit

Came to the US with a dollar and a [drinking-heavy?] father
Was a motherfucking pimp, shit
You see the 'Cash Only' sign on the register?
Gave half of the money to the minister
My mother was stressed her son was possessed
The devil takes no fucking prisoners

('Cos they call me mellow yellow)
I see your parents are worried you're fucking with yellow boys now
Tell 'em that they should be worried I'm thinking of hanging around [Korean phrase in background]

[INTERLUDE]
Set down your beer like
Nigga what's up?
How gangsta are you cuz?
How gangsta are you nigga?
I'll show you how gangsta I am nigga, you can drop off...

[VERSE 2]
You fucking up my hype before I was Mahatma Gandhi
Man I was loving life like white girls love their kamikazes
Now you in hot water
Shabu throw your body in the dock while I
Let her rot, then I feed her to the rottweillers
0 to 100
Shit that got violent
Anybody could get bodied on the low
Got a couple shottas on the phone”
With a hot head that don't got friends
Turn the party to a homicidal zone
Drinks to the fore
Sets being ripped up up up
Shots in the air
Shit's getting wrecked fuck fuck fuck
Pigs at the door
Weaves getting pulled
Blood being shed
Told you not to make threats

[HOOK]
(Mellow yellow)

Mellow motherfucker chilling with a hundred hoes
Share a POV another hundred Go Pros
At the karaoke bring the domis in a row
1 got a fat ass
2 got titties
3 making out with 4

I see your parents are worried you're fucking with yellow boys now
Tell 'em that they should be worried I'm thinking of hanging around [Korean phrase in background]

They call me mellow yellow
