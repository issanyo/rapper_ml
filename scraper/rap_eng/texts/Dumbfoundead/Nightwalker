[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Don't do it, no favours
Night walker, you're shameless
I'm supposed to leave
Big problem
You murderer, I saw and...

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
Now I have to bleed
You tore a hole in my flesh
How'm supposed to breathe, with a knife in my chest?

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Goddam you, can't stop from killing
You give them head then you go and chop off their heads
Then I bleed, theres no feelings at all

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
But now I have to bleed
You tore a hole in my flesh
How'm supposed to breathe, with a knife in my chest

[Verse 3: DFD]
Heels with the devil red bottoms
Stained from a blood that you walked in
No conscience, new options
New man's convertible sitting shotgun
Walking out like you ain't never do me wrong
Judas, in Louis Vuitton
You be fronting' like an innocent gal though
Backstabbing fem fetale hoe
Why you got these naked pictures in your iPhone
You ain't never send them pictures out to my phone
Cup caking with a motherfucker I know
Cold blooded girl put me in a blindfold
You be killing them the same way you killing me
Never thought I'd see the day you be the enemy
If I gotta bleed, then I gotta bleed
(Let it be)

[Hook: Anderson .Paak]
But now I have to bleed
You tore a hole in my flesh
How'm supposed to breathe, with a knife in my chest

But now I have to bleed
You tore a hole in my flesh
How'm supposed to breathe, with a knife in my chest
