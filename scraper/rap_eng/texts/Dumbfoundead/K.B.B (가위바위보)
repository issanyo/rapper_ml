[Intro: Jessi]
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x4)

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Microdot, half the YOX
And one bad man I'm a 나쁜 남자
I should go first
내가 먼저 해야지 덤파형 바쁘니깐
I wear my beanies like Gil from Leessang
피쳐할때는 진짜 비싸
But these my bros from west to east side
If you ain't my bro then fuck the peace sign
Like 가위바위보
Your bitch got my wifi code
I'm rich bitch my life dope, yea
Lit like a night light, 잘자
Nothin like a nightlife quite like Seoul
All of my bitches they stay out in 신사
I switch up the girls during 이차
Drop em all off in a 빈차
90 degrees when they 인사
Kick it with nothing but real heads
Cause I ain't got time for no bullshit
Bottom of shoes looking real red
Like 아저씨's drinking at 술집's
I got a visa from here to Ibiza
We puttin in work, work work
Rock paper scissor, I guess I'm the winner
So let me go first
가위바위보

[Hook: Jessi]
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2) (가위바위보)
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2) (I said)
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2) (가위바위보)
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2)

[Verse 2: Lyricks]
I took a red eye
And landed showered
Then met up with Micro, Dummy got 배달
And jumped in the Rover then speed up to 천호
Jessie came to the studio
Turned it into mother fuckin 1OAK
Yall know my Wells Fargo looking
Like a 한국 전화 번호 Digits
Bad Rap
We the illest independent homie that’s that
Master of ceremony, bring the cash back
Pound a 40 like a hashtag
Step to us get ur ass capped
Big numbers when I do that show
I-95 how I move that dope
I got drive, NY to Seoul
It’s the YOX for the few that know
Rolling with the YOX
We the best it gets lonely on the top
No stress cuz I’m homies with the dot
No rest 벌써 졸리냐? Weak boy
Lemme set it straight, Lemme educate
Lemme give a taste let me embed it inside of your mind
So every time you hear me saying that I’m one of the greats
I'm not just saying it to finish a rhyme mufukka

[Hook: Jessi]
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2) (가위바위보)
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2) (I said)
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2) (가위바위보)
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2)

[Verse 3: Microdot]
누가 먼저 가위바위보
From buses to driving that Rove
Mom now dripping and cooking in gold
Makin’ that music and baking that soul
Cake, cake, cake, so much cake
We could run a baking sale
AK, AK
That’s that Auckland city lifestyle
That’s game boy, that major league
Self-made, no lottery
40,000 feet up in the air (Up in the air)
No economy
Going coast to coast, to shows to shows
Don’t mean to brag and boast my nose
My success came with no strings
Attached, I’m my own boss
Talkin’ bout bars, no Snickers
And no not the one under my zippers
I cut and paste, and rearrange man
I go dumb dumb with my lyrics
Bitches be bitchin and jealousy be hittin’
Them kittens like the Kardashians
내가 뭘 하고 어딜 가던
얼마 벌고 어디에다 쓰건
Don’t worry bout me, I’m makin’ a livin’
Nothing came free, nada was given
Young fat boy straight outta New Zealand
Feelin’ good vibes, Dumb, Rick and Million
About to play a game, rock paper scissors
Three dope boys, guess we the trillest
No new friends, this is family business
Oh, and my sister, Jessi

누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2) (가위바위보)

누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2) (가위바위보)
누가 먼저 가위바위보 (x2)

[Outro: Jessi]
가위바위보 가위바위보
가위바 I say
가위바위보 가위바위보
가위바 보 보
가위바위보 가위바위보
가위바 I say
누가 먼저 가위바위보
