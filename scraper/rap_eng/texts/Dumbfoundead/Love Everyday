"Love Everyday"

[Intro:]
You gotta' love everyday

[Verse 1:]
It’s been years, now your heart is hard as granite
Taking everything for granted
When use to grant her anything she wanted
You were on it, complimenting her with comments
Now there’s less conversation as you stare at electronics
Now every holiday you just renew your old membership
February flowers, birthday sex, and December gifts
Affection isn’t something you just schedule in the calendars
Loving is a year round gig she can’t have enough
Don’t give it to her then someone else will
For the realest motherfuckers in the game she will
Why you gotta be reminded by an ecstasy pill
How ecstasy feel, man that sex should be real
You use to put in effort now you got mad comfortable
She became insurance, you just paying the deductible
You giving her the minimum, how long will she fuck with you?
Man fuck what you heard, you gotta love everyday

[Hook:]
Love everyday
Love is a full time job
No holidays off, be advised
Love everyday
7 days a week, year round
If you got what it takes, hold it down
Love everyday
What you want a fucking gold medal for a couple rose petals and a card?
Love everyday
Love everyday
Love every February 14th and beyond

[Verse 2:]
Just cause you a nice guy don’t mean you a good man
Just ‘cause you a bad bitch don’t mean that you wifey
Tappin’ on the walls, man, I’m tappin’ that nightly
Yes, she turn me on but can’t tap into my psyche
She like me but don’t know a damn thing about me
Far from an adult but a master at adultery
Doin’ it like porn, body in perfect form
There for me orally but she don’t orally support
She know how to turn me on by turning off the night switch
Only puts in work after ten, like the night shift
My side chick but I’m lookin’ for a sidekick
A woman with drive and not just one that could drive stick
Poor little thing, she don't really get it man, she gives good head
But got a shitty brain, knows how to entertain for sixty
Minutes straight but ain’t got the slightest clue
How to love everyday

[Hook:]
Love everyday
Love is a full time job

7 days a week, year round
If you got what it takes, hold it down
Love everyday
What you want a fucking gold medal for a couple rose petals and a card?
Love everyday
Love everyday
Love every February 14th and beyond

[Verse 3:]
When your momma called you be calling' that bugging'
But you bugging' cause that what you call loving'
The little things that count for the woman that
Was down for you since day one birthin all eight pounds of you
Look at you, busy guy, big man, lunch meetings, big plans
Forgot about your loved ones like a discman
Bending head over heels for your boss and idolizing
That all mighty dollar over all but remember
You can’t take the money to the grave
But you can show her how much you love her
Before it's late cause love conquers all
In a world full of hate it can last forever but flowers die in a day Love is inconvenient, being there when they need it
Loving is living, as common as eating and breathing
Age of Aquarius, time for a change let the sunshine in and begin
