[Intro]
M-A-P T-H-E Soul
M-A-Z-E, lose control

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Three blind mice as we're lost in the maze route
Lookin' for the easiest possible way out
Day in and day out, you run into a closed road
Turning into old folk, chasing after rose gold
What they don't know is that it belongs to a fool
Choosing wants over needs, singing songs of a mule
Carrying their burdens when you barely know the person
And that is the difference between a pharaoh and a servant
I choose to serve no man but serve mankind
At the same time avoiding all of Earth's landmines
You step in it and you blow up
You exit or you grow up, or get locked up
The pigs catch ya eating donuts
But I'd rather rhyme bars than sit behind bars
How can a prison cell contain this shining bright star
They have no idea what I could do in a minute's time
Break down the walls of the maze and run through the finish line

[Hook]
Life is like a maze (x3)
When I'm flippin' through the pages

[Verse 2: MYK]
It's high definition black and white
Is it digital, analog, wack or tight?
It's stressful wishing sacrifice
And the list goes on. It's the facts of life
East coast ettiquite, west coast slang
Peace we'll never get if shit don't change
Do you play with the majors or go independent?
Gotta stay paid but I'm broke like a peasant
Love, sex, greed, addictions
What's next? Need directions
There's nobody left to follow
Wallow in my sorrow for a hollow tomorrow
Life is like a maze, try to keep track of the days
That take us from place to place. Awaken and face-to-face
Too many choices, possibilities, indecision is killing me
And if you lend a helping hand, then I will follow willingly

[Hook]

[Bridge]
M-A-P T-H-E Soul
M-A-Z-E, lose control

[Verse 3: Tablo]
Flip through fashion magazines, cop a swag or lean
When nothing's goin' 'smooth', rub a little vaseline
Do an online, offline, frontline search
Either quench or confine your Columbine thirst
Cuz you wanna fit in, and find a perfect 'match'
To set your heart in flames. You wanna be a catch
Catch-22, catch the flu, catchphrase
By any means necessary in this rat's maze
It's a black haze muddle, a rainy day puddle
Life is gonna wet ya, get ya in a muzzle
A struggle to survive, a huddle nine to five with no quarterback
(Change?) You won't even get a quarter back
It's a murder fact, reality kills
Call your doctor now for your reality pills
Chill, but still worry... a bug's goin' around
Cause life is like your homie, it's 'holdin' you down'

[Hook]
