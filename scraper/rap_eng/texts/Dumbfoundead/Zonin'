Intro:
There's nothing like now, there's nothing like...
There's nothing like now, there's nothing like...

Verse 1:
I live my life the same way I kick my freestyles, never premeditated
Zonin’ with a weed smile, im california livin, and new york city driven,
My only vices might be good weed and pretty women,
I don’t know what I want, but I know I want everything
I’ve lit up parties out in every scene, keroscene,
I'm doing what I love the thing that people dream of
Married to this game without considering a pre-nup
There was no plan b, told myself I can be
A superhero make my self denero like I’m stan lee,
I was a day dreamer, voted as the night mayor
Packed inside a club like I don’t like air

Hook:
Soak it up, and dance all night till you sweat out all the toxins
So soak it up, this is that music for your body to get lost in
Soak it up, forget tomorrow and learn to live the moment
Soak it up, yea im zonin, im’ smoking I’m zonin

Bridge:
I'm feelin' glued to this beat
I've got a bruise on my feet
Forget the rest of the week
I'm in the zone zone zone
I'm getting high as a kite
Don’t feel like being polite
So imma do what I like
I'm in the zone zone zone

Verse 2:
Ive made mad mistakes but I wouldn’t reverse one
Been through so much shit that shots feel like its from nerf guns, Party like its 2012, nothing can hurt me
And deal with the hangover in year 2013,
Go out with close friends, wake up to total strangers
Your face is swollen so you bring it down with frozen tators,
Yea I know the saying play now pay later
When they try to tell me that I tell 'em go away hater

Hook:
So soak it up, and dance all night till you sweat out all the toxins
So soak it up, this is that music for your body to get lost in
So soak it up, forget tomorrow and learn to live the moment
So soak it up, yea I'm zonin', I'm smoking I’m zonin'

Bridge:
I want to kiss on a freak, go out and piss on the street
I want to live like a king, I'm in the zone zone zone
I'd like to meet you tonight, try to make peace in a fight
And put hashish in a pipe , I'm in the zone zone zone
Smoke it up, smoke smoke, Smoke it up, smoke smoke, Smoke it up, smoke smoke, Smoke it up
