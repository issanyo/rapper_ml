Let the beat hit you with a big bang, make the girls dip low
People taking pics, click, pause, for a quick pose
Armored cars, body guards rocking thick trench coats
If you get close then you might get your wig blown

D to the FD, fly as a frisbee
Fans with their hands holding signs saying kiss me
Cup full of whiskey, pocket full of weed
Got a catalog of bangers, iPod full of Ds

Yo, it's killah California, sorry I didn't inform ya
But Iâ€™ve served your favorite rappers like Anna Kournikova
My freestyle game is even nicer than your written emcee's
I've slain need vicoddin prescriptions
Yeah, get your Xani bars up
Got these kids looking at me like I'm daddy warbucks (?)

All you trust fund babies, please hand me your trust
And I'll double your money by fucking challenger's up (?)
You can shoot crazy videos with Canon 5ds
Use youtube and Ustream satillite feds
Wear my clothes, and my shoes, and have my ID
But it won't ever turn you into a rapper like me

Where's Dumb from? It's probably Andromeda
Styles off the chart that blew up the damn monitors
We've never had a reading like this on the swaggometer
No body wanna see me, call me your tax auditor

H&R Block flow catch me on your blog post
To given out free shit like Oprah's talk show
You get one, you get one, and you too
Look under your seat there's a dub sack glued to

And on the last day of 2010 and I was with the homie wax
Talking bout the taking over sippin' on some cognac
Cutie with a booty passed by we made a toast to that
Changing up the industry like they did with the zodiac

Yessir, man I'm spittin' straight crack
Makin' y'all look stupid like Gucci Mane's face tat
Ha, brr it's getting cold in here
I'm taking rap back to it's golden years

Check it, they got these Asians stereotypes what's with that
My dick's big, I drive good, and I suck at math
But I can fucking rap so watch your fucking mouth
Before I do some martial arts shit and punch you out

I'm not the timid type, I live the city life
Got just the right amount of arrogance that women like
I drink and smoke la vida loca
I'm tryna run LA call me Villaraigosa

2011 you're gonna hear a whole lot of me
I'm making better music then most of these Grammy nominees
Their albums been going platinum and mines just went mahogany
But I ain't really trippin', cause one day they're gonna honor me

In the past year I've acquired a little web fame
Met a lot of haters, and liars with in the net game
Got a little buzzed but I ain't even full of head change
Too busy getting my bars up, catch phrase

I ain't a silly kid doing video blogs
If I did them as a youth it would be the city of god
Cause I was more into robberies than getting a job
I just shut this shit down, turn the internet off
I said that bubba bubba, that bubba bubba kush kush

That bubba bubba, that bubba bubba, kush kush
That bubba bubba, that bubba bubba, kush kush
That bubba bubba, that bubba bubba, kush kush
