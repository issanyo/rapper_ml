[Hook 1]
Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets cheap here
That's why you can catch me here
Trying to scratch my way up to the top
Cause my jobs got me going nowhere, so I ain't gotta thing to lose
Take me to a place where I dont care, this is me and my liquor store blues

[Verse 1]
Im at the Liquor store, swisher rolled, mr. cho, give me mo', a drink or fo, a sinking soul, that needs you bro
Change in my pockets low, stop and go, hook me up for cheaper though, I pull the race card cause its Korean owned
I've seen the older folk put there fate in some lucky numbers
A pack of smokes are bad for throats but it does do wonders
I've spent a bunch of summers, hanging out at store fronts
That sweet sound of ringing bells once the door shuts
Scored blunts and took everything thats inside out
I treat this place like my personal hideout
40 ounce to freedom, 30 days of drinkin
But im only in my 20's and im thinking that I need it
Never sleeping like a genius, positioned like a fetus
It's a cold world we live in, and the liquor keeps me heated
I just spit my old English, while I dream about them new castles
And homeless man I want the same thing that you ask fo. (Change)

[Hook 2]
Cause my jobs got me going nowhere, so I ain't gotta thing to lose
Take me to a place where I dont care, this is me and my liquor store blues
I take one shot for my pain, one track for my sorrow
I get messed up today, i'll be okay tomorrow

[Verse 2]
Ive seen the children in my hood rot there teeth away
There are no healthy spots around here to eat and play
I've seen my father go get money out the b of a
Just to buy some e and j I guess its in my DNA
I've seen bullets flyin barely scratchin thick glass
I've seen the foolish dyin in pursuit of quick cash
Sugar and spice down the aisles I need my fix fast
Give me that high like a ride up at six flags
They tell me come again, like its my punishment
And I get dominatrix wasted like I'm loving it
Yellow and black sign lit up like a cabride
Pull in as I pass by, and say that it's the last time
The doors are always open, hopin that they never close
Grim reaper getting close cloaked in clothes from metal shows
Broadcasting 24, suburbanites and ghetto folks
Some of yall will never know, my liquor store blues
