This is how I start the day
Pour out my Chardonnay
Put on my penny loafers, I call 'em Hardaways
I grab the paper and not the check on the market place
I mean the papers to spark an 8th from my garden space
I plant the harvest like I'm celebrating Arbor Day
Put on that Dr. Dre, Marvin Gaye, or that Carter tape
Go off the top like a barber fade, no one hard as me
You've seen my jam sessions, I don't mean marmalade
So keep that in the jar
Still starving, living large
Witty bars, really sharp
Coming at you, ninja stars
I'm giving seminars, lessons in spitting hard
Certified hustler, go ahead and take a business card
I'll make your building shake, check on your real estate
Break apart interstates like a set of dinner plates
Bigger than the chick who figure-skated in the Winter Games
Kick y'all motherfuckers, then ask me if it was real or fake
