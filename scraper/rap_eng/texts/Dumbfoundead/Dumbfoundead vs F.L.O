[Round 1: F.L.O.]
Introducing the proud owner of a Jackie Chan poster
And a five foot bong made for lonely opium smokers
I'm surprised you even showed up today
Cause you got warrants and on the run from the ASPCA
See you fit the profile of a predator when you moved into town
Like you get hungry when you hear Snoop Dogg and the Dogg Pound
When I move to a neighborhood, the women stay wet
A week after you moved in, there wasn't no mo' stray pets
See you'll pay rock paper scissor for chop liver and pot stickers
And eat a whole living cat fish, even the eyes and whiskers
If this accusation ain't true
He got a shaved, glazed duck hangling and dangling from his Honda rear view
For real, on animals you be ill
You laugh when Bambi's mother and Simba's father got killed
You a southern Cali malnutritioned boy who lost
Who's biggest decision is between duck and soy sauce
Look, how come that, Mr. Chow Yun Fat
Can't tell the difference between cow or cat?

[Round 1: Dumbfoundead]
Yo, Lush, why did you pair up the two of us to fight?
I went from battling The Saurus to F.L.O., what am I doing with my life?
Yo, your music isn't tight, you rap like you're woozy from a flight
This motherfucker came from the Bay to star in a new movie called Steaks On A Plane
There's motherfucking steaks on this motherfucking plane
But this motherfucker ate 'til his stomach was in pain
Coming out in May
But I'ma do his as charity for my battle peeps
This muhfucka sound half asleep
You sound like Master P if he had to pee
But I'ma have fun with it, cause Battle Of L.A. part 1 was a riot
You're like a less funnier Marv Won on a diet
Yo, your metaphors are weaker than my credit score
You're weaker than that one kid I served from Equator
I went from battling that last guy with infected pores
To some random dude no one's checking for
But I still get a shit load views on youtube I guess less is more
By the way, when did your two front teeth get divorced?
I'm a show this fool the exit door

[Round 2: F.L.O.]
I tend to generalize when I take a view of life
So fuck you Tandtrum, my bad, y'all look alike
Like Bruce Lee had a baby with Chung Lee named "Dumb Lee"
Then changed his name to Dumbfoundead to Dub 3
They started doing tai-chi, rocking a karate gi
Staring at the sea, posing as a yellow golden tree
Don't wanna make you mad, wanna fight and start tripping
Cause he's a ninja engine, he can scissor kick a flying pigeon
You could use your bare hands to go fishing
Helicopter kick a helicopter while the propeller is spinning
Cause you're no stranger to danger
I mean, your great grandfather built the 36 Chambers
See you could be an icon in Taiwan
But the only time you see or say "doe" is at the end of "tae kwon"
Your girl is fish stinky
She refer to your penis as crouching tiger, shrinking pinky
This moron is amazing
See Asians are smart, but let me get this right...you're a dumb Asian?
I don't get that shit

[Round 2: Dumbfoundead]
Yo, did you think you'd truly win with your droopy chin?
Looking like you'd be in one of those wack shows on UPN
You're the only one our girl friends with a girlfriend
And you look a lot darker since the Parkers
Looking like a musty, crusty, Bun B
You need lotion, chap stick and sun screen
You look unhealthy and unclean
Brushing your teeth takes less than five minutes
I'm surprised you don't care about hygiene when it has the word "high" in it
Yo, I can tell that you never shower and you ain't gonna start either
You got more crust around your lips than a large pizza
Ayo, not to mention, your body odor, someone spray some potpourri
He look like one of them fat, black, lesbian rappers, I'ma call him F.L.O.etry
Yo, I'ma murder you so bad, they gonna identify you by your dental records
But at your funeral, instead of flowers, people are gonna leave chicken tenders
Yo, he's the only black guy who wishes his dick was bigger
He be pretending he has pussy in his face by putting his tits together
Yo, looking like a gay Carl Winslow and rhyming at a Ray Charles tempo
I'm a kill you with one liners cause I hate long insults

[Round 3: F.L.O.]
P.Blow, emo assholes
The new politically correct, racially diverse version of the Little Rascals
To get in they club houser, you gotta rub snowzers
And Eskimo kiss they leader, the Asian Alfalfa
I'll pull some salt in the wound before I shut the fuck up
How come nobody from Project Blowed ever blow up?
C'mon y'all, we all know what's up
Besides Nocan' the whole second generation sucks
I mean, you got some battle quotes but you're not dope
And fucking Sahtyre sound like he got nut in his throat
Y'all two on WRC, that was so so wrong
It was like Fey Long hooked up with Ray Dong Chong
Who you gonna call? Lyraflip at rhyme time?
He gotta battle record of 0 and 4 in Grind Time
Nigga, you getting served, all y'all on prime time
It's my opinion, but ask anyone here if I'm lying
Look, I got you shook man
My Oakland Ninja Turtles will run circles around your southern Cali foot clan

[Round 3: Dumbfoundead]
Yo, I go to rap battles looking so west side of my fresh jive
You go to job interviews with pieces of french fries on your neck tie
You look like Tech-N9ne if he were Shrek size without the red dye
Yo, has anybody seen this guy's Twitter page?
He be updating it every fricking day with different shit he ate
12:58: Fish fillet
2:00 : Chicken steak
5:45 : Mmm, dinner's great
6:00 : Time for lemon cake
Wait, that was only a fifteen minute break!
Aye, we don't need an update on every cupcake you ate at lunch break fuck face
Yo, I'm surprised you even know how to use the internet
He still hasn't figured out the screen at the drive thru window yet
Yo, I looked at his computer table, he has crumbs on his desktop
I looked at his monitor, how the fuck did you get crumbs on your desk top?
F.L.O., I asked him if he was gay and he said, "Yes and no"
He's kind of like Pinocchio but forget the nose
When he tells a hoax his neck will grow extra rolls
Looking like Funkmaster Flex but broke
We got a good thing going out with the FreshCoast
But you're an embarrassment to the whole camp
During the WRCs you were to Lush what Rheteric was to Nocan'
