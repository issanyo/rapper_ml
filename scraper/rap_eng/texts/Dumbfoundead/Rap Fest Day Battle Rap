Yo I'm a word wizard
I'm son of rap bear
But you're a fire hazard
Maybe I should be scared
I mean I do hear you're dangerous when your temper flares
Do guys even date you? Or just cook weiners in your hair

I guess there was that fire guy that wanted to marry you
Was it Don Jon with the big guns?
Oh but you're not into macho men are you?
You like them soft and round like cinnamon-flavoured buns

[FP]
I got more rhymes in my hair than you ever will
You better run away like it's a fire drill
You're so lame and stinky
More spark from my pinky
I'm a flaming master um, slinky, hinky
(Oh Glob, what am I saying?)

[FP sees her father in the audience and rages at his selfishness]

[FP]
Why the heck did I even try to talk to you?
You only ever cared about things like
Koalas and chipmunks and baby kangaroos
It's actually pretty sad I mean
I usurped you when I was fourteen
I thought we could be friends
I don't know what I was thinking
I don't need you or anyone
'Cos I'm the real Flame King

And as for Son of Rap Bear
You're so unoriginal you put your own dad in a wheelchair
Just so you could steal his name and ride on his fame
But without it you're just a sad kid full of hot air
Y'all can try to bully me or scam me I don't care
As if being a jerk is going to make you dummies happy
But my kingdom ain't a commodity Toronto, it's a part of me
So sorry, you can't take what isn't owned by me
So take him away

[SORB]
[In defeat]
I thought I was the Glob of rap rivalled by none
But I'm more like bubble wrap 'cos she squashed me for fun
