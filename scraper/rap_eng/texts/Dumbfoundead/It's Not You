[Intro]
I want what I used I to feel
I need a boost or a refill
I know it's selfish of me
To want to break up and rebuild

[Verse 1]
Old love has gotten cold, love
Up down that rocky road, love
We lost that rock 'n' roll love
Bossonova, box of roses
Where'd we go wrong, never saw it coming
Sky was the limit, never thought we would plummet
Now we lie to each other, never keep it one hundred
I don't want to be around to witness what this is becoming

[Hook: David Choi]
It's been crazy, baby lately
Life has been so, bitter tasting
Let's be strangers, just keep walking
I'll make it easy, it's not you, it's me
Don't mean to be this way
I know it sounds cliche
Don't have much else to say
It's not you, it's me
No need for you to blame
I'll take it anyway
I'll carry on the shame
It's not you, it's me

[Verse 2]
Famous last words
Now you're looking at me like "Save it, man"
Those are the words of a heart breaker
Also known as the world's most dangerous man
Break ups are the same as aiming a stainless
Until that thing go blam
Thought that it'd be painless
But love is a language I don't understand
In the beginning I was in it to chase
I was something out the wilderness, now give me a taste
Moving in for the kill with no minute to waste
Killing mistakes, slow and steady always wins the race
Pile full of photographs, phone full of texts
Burn all the proof then move on to the next
I know it sounds harsh, but the quicker you forget
Is the quicker you'll find happiness

[Hook]

[Outro]
Day 1 you were fine as shit
Banging body and designer fits
Day 30 you were mine and shit
We were hanging out all the time, good shit
Day 100, fighting over minor shit
But I still ended up sticking 'round this bitch
Years gone by and I'm tired of shit
Sorry love I gotta call it quits
