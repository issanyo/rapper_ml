[Intro]
(I never knew)
(That evol you)
(I should've stayed away from you)
I never knew (I never knew)
That evol you (that evol you)
I should've stayed away from you

[Verse 1]
Last night we hit it, that glass like ceiling
We been playing this game way past ninth inning
That fast life, every night, smashin' mad women
I gave it up for you, I knew I had a bad feelin'
When I met you it was world peace, now its world war 3
I gave you floor seats and you gave me nosebleeds
Bad chick, bad meaning bad, not good
Hollywood taught you well, how to fool em into love
All that flirtin', goin' through my cellphone cursin'
With all your chicken head friends at the club twerkin'
Now you drunk every damn night, fuckin' with that white
I don't know you any more, I'm disgusted by your sight
Back from tour, and I'm greeted with complainin', I don't need it
Shoulda seen it from a mile away, that shit you do when I'm away
I'm seein' all your true colors, comin' out a darker shade
This time around you can't fix it with no lingerie, hey

[Hook]
I never knew (I never knew)
That evol you (that evol you)
I should've stayed away from you (I should've stayed away from you)
I never knew (I never knew)
That evol you (that evol you)
I should've stayed away from you (I should've stayed away from you)

[Verse 2]
She saying:
Oh you got some nerve, comin' at me with them words
You ain't' got no right, when you the biggest hypocrite on earth
You can't walk in to my life, every couple months then leave
How you want me playin' wife, when you ain't offer me a ring?
Ever think about my needs, while you livin' out your dreams?
Out there travelin' the world, and I can't go out for a drink?
That's bull shit, don't say shit, you out there with your crew too
Them chicken heads you mentioned, more reliable than you boo
Don't think that I ain't knowin' bout them hoes that you be fuckin'
At shows to all your sessions, and you say that I'm disgustin'?
By the way all the coke you mentioned that I'm always sniffin'
I bought it from your dealer when you made that introduction
You rap what's on the surface to make it seem like its my fault
You write me in your verses, but when can I share my song?
These couple bars might be the only chance that I may ever get
So this for
You Jon, I wish that we had never met

[Hook]
