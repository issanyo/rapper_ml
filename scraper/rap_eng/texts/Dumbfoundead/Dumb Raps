Dumb x9

Yo, dumb politicians, there's dumb celebrities
The dumb rule the world, yes dumb's heredity
The young dumb doesn't fall far from the dumb tree
Lead 'em, we need 'em, the young will set us free
This kingdom of freedom that we call the U.S
Is more than the stardom, than wisdom, the new shit
Don't need 'em, we want 'em, but we can't afford 'em
We watch it, we listen, they move on from boredom
Our kids are all dumb, our sons have got sons
We're stuck between being pro-choice and condoms
Pandimonium, dummies holding guns
The dumb giving speeches behind the podium
Dumbdidi dum dumb, did dumb really kick 'em?
Was dumb a victim or did dumb really trick them?
We watch dumb videos, we like dumb lyrics
Dumb was found dead, and Dumbfoundead killed it
