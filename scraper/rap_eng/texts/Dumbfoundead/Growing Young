Yo
Be a man, John, be a man
Used to get them Marlboros for dad
It made me feel grown
Didn't know the problems he had
But he was real gone
When he had the bottle in hand
He was just dead wrong

Promised that I would never grow up and be him
But I never grew up at all
And now I'm womanizing and cheatin', drinkin' heavily in the P.M
Havin' myself a monsters ball, just like my pa
My girl lookin' the same way my mom did
Smeared makeup and tears under her eyelids
Generations of havin' a down ass chick
But we always end up fuckin' up that shit
Pointin' fingers at all of my male figures
The only thing gettin' bigger is makin' 'bout six figures
And everybody just shut up when I put it on my tab
Ain't it sad when a Visa's the only credit you have? Huh
But that's just John, and that's how he is
That’s the only way people come into my defense
But that's just wrong, but that's how it is
And it be helpin' me get away with a lot of shit
Alotta shit, a lotta shit, I wish somebody really gave me a whole lot of shit
But they on the dick, yeah they on my dick, now my ego is getting bigger than Moby Dick

They see the videos, they see the hero
They take a mess and paint a mural
Edit out the a-hole put in the b-roll
Render the clips, and you got pure gold

Shoutout to B tho, that’s mi amigo, kept me in check when I was actin' like a devo
When I was Steve O, he made me Steve Jobs, I'm a CEO, now look at me ma
Now look at me ma, I'm on my grown shit
When I mean grown, I mean takin' care of my own shit
Now look at me pa, this is some grown shit
Now what you taught me, forget it, I flipped the whole script

Now look at me girl, I’m on my grown shit
What I'm sayin', I mean it my word is golden
Everything I'm sayin' you’re probably thinkin' no shit
I shoulda known this already, but I’m ready now
