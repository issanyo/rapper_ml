[Verse 1]

What time is on the Rolex
Ask the homie LO-DEF
We sipping on that Moet (your chick is getting mo' wet)
I take her to the bathroom and now the bathroom is co-ed
I ain't give a fuck like OF (if she throw it I'mma catch it)
She got stolen, interception, pussy killer, call me Dexter
You ain't fuck her like an expert so she faking like a wrestler
She's partying like Kesha, I take her home and undress her
I be scoring like I'm Kobe but no problems with Vanessa
Metta World Peace, throwing bows to the teeth
Higher than the nosebleeds, but we're front row seats
Got the blunt rolled trees looking like Yosemite
I be smoking tokin' O's but I ain't Japanese
Nah, used to call me Chino, I used to hang with them cholos
Now I walk the neighborhood dolo and stay flexing call me Bolo
Got a white girl out of NoHo, with a booty big as Coco's
And she like it when I pull her hair and put her in a chokehold

[Hook]

Got your girl screaming out, COTDAMN
High as fuck and leaned out, COTDAMN
You know what I'm talking 'bout
Cause you ain't doing nothin if you ain't got 'em saying COTDAMN

[Verse 2]

So fresh, so clean, no sweat
I know your girls G-spot, turn right, go left
She's shaking in both legs, she bend it like Bo-Flex
We role play, I'm doctor, now say ahh, throat check
I know I'm looking Asian, but money is my language
Dollar signs I'm so fly, you don't fly, you're penguins
I got a flow so dangerous, don't piss me off I'm Genghis
Is you with me or against me, pick a funeral or banquet
I be killing shit, driving out the dealership
No it ain't a rental, tinted windows, presidential shit
Everybody looking like it must be someone interesting
Clinton shit, baby holla at me for an internship

[Hook]
