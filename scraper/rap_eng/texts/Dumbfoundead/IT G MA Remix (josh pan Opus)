[Intro: Keith Ape & (A$AP Ferg)]
잊지 마
Underwater squad
I’m a motherfuckin' trendsetter
I’m a motherfuckin' trendsetter
Squad shit

(Fuck all my enemies)
(Fuck all my enemies)

[Verse 1: Keith Ape]
Bitch, I'm a zombie
너무 마신 싸구려 코데인
여전히 몸에는 검/흰 camo down
You know we going harder
Than a mutha muthafucking ape
난 욕죠에 누워 쇼핑해
그건 베이프 베이프 베이프 베이프 베이프
키쓰 에이프, 잊지 마, Killer Whale
Killer Whale, Killer Whale, Killer Whale, Killer Whales
수영해 수영해 수영해
우린 곧 돈으로 수영해
너넨 컴퓨터로 구경해
너네 삶까지 내가 주연해
그니까 잊지 마 내 이름, 절대로 잊지 마 내 팀을
잊지 마 절대 내 이름, 잊지 마 절대 내 팀을
한국에서 우릴 잊음 귀를 잃어

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Sipping Henny got me goin' ape shit
Weed got me wasted, walk up in this bitch like I'm Asian
Been a minute since I’ve been in Shibuya, goddamn it been a long vacation
Keith Ape in the cut like Fredo, I'm gon' be alright
Better duck when you see his K blow, he gon' take your life
All of my ninjas with the 9, A$AP Mob we gon' rep everyday
Underwater squad, yeah, we the killer whales
Finna get wet with the heat when we spray
Fuck all my enemies, you can find me mobbin' with my ninjas everyday
Nigga, this ain't no industry shit, I be with my niggas from the 143 everyday

[Bridge: Waka Flocka Flame]
IT G MA
Hollows gon' fly, it's a homicide
Momma's goin' cry, sing a lullaby
It's all about us, never 'bout I
It's all about trust, never 'bout lies
Hollows gon' fly, it's a homicide
Momma's goin' cry, sing a lullaby
It's all about us, never 'bout I
It's all about-
IT G MA
Hollows gon' fly, it's a homicide
Momma's goin' cry, sing a lullaby
It's all about us, never 'bout I
It's all about trust, never 'bout lies

Momma's goin' cry, sing a lullaby
It's all about us, never 'bout I

[Interlude: Father]
Never mind, never mind
Bitch, never mind
Mo' bitches, many riches
Date, by the lake
In your place, in your place
It's too late, in your lace
In your gaze, at my pace

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]
I'm movin' onto bigger things
Big bank take little bank, bow to the lizard king
Took DMT by the DMZ, made peace as the middle man
Then I woke up with a .45, seein' everybody firin' at both sides
We can all dream till then, we can all drink, live in fear like Ichabod Crane
I be sick of y'all, fuck 'em all, they do the same thing, not me
Not me, muthafucka, top three, I cannot be explained
Got the homie Keith Ape with a briefcase and a 38, lookin' for the nearest currency exchange
Low key, then I'm gone, took keys to the blonde
Givin' D to your broad like "aye, aye"
Couple Gs from abroad, five peas in a pod, learned to speak in the speech of the gods

[Verse 4: Anderson .Paak]
(Yes lawd!)
I can't fall for that weak shit, all this working ain't free, bitch
I been down for eight Easters, now I'm up like the eastern
Mushrooms in my reefer, moonrocks in her keister
Straight shots of cold ether
Tell Keith Imma catch a body on the track like I spit it with the Desert Eagle, the heat seek and ya better dip if you're squeamish
A full seam, all I need is a target and hit 'em off in this bitch full deck of parts, a gallon of water in the spliff
Niggas pop shit like all damn day
Niggas say they happy for ya, lying to ya face
You niggas can't get no time of the day
Niggas still bitter like an IPA
Niggas playing catch-up like a high speed race
Fucking with my money is a muthafuckin' ace
Fuckin' with a bunny with the Coca-Cola shape, rollin up another hundred take another to the face
Wait, it's fucking lit
Bitch get off my fuckin' dick
You must not know you fuckin' with
You must not know my fuckin' clique
That's Art Club and Free Nationals
That's out of body experience
That's cash only when the card ain't working and the plug ain't got that square shit, I'm prepared for this
(Yes lawd!)
Say, I'm rare, bitch, you standard
Mo' kerosene in my lantern
More gasoline in my Backwood, I'm revving
Say, that means I'm beast mode
You new chick is my ex-ho
And on the weekend she give deep-throat, and that's deep, bro
But I can't weep for none
My patience short
Your time is up
My time has come
I'm peakin' though (god damn)
