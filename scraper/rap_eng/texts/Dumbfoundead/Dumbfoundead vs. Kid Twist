[Round 1: Dumbfoundead]
First of all it's an honor to be in the spot
Drinking tea in the pot, with the majesty, my lady, Queen Of The Dot
I heard that you like reading a lot, a real scholastics wiz
Books like Harry Potter cause you play with magic sticks
Why do they keep setting me up against these faggot kids
Cause I already battled Illusion Z and he's just like you with a Latin twist
I will Kanye this bitch
Hop on stage and shit and snatch the mic from Taylor Twist
You gay as shit, what I'm saying is
When you date a chick it's considered a lesbian relationship
You have all white fans that wear tight pants and listen to Streisand
Your voice has that gay girl tone
It makes my voice sound like James Earl Jones
By the way, that wack nose looks like a chicken nugget
I bet that fat hoes must friggin love it
Looking like a pterodactyl's distant cousin
I came here for nerd stomping, not bird watching
Yo, when I rap you see birds flocking
When you rap you wear girl's stockings
Don't crack under the pressure Twist the world's watching
Yo, this arrogant queer is embarrassed of his heritage here
So watch this dude get chopped and lose his top like an American beer
Twist off

[Round 1: Kid Twist]
Hey, someone tell the bartender she didn't match my order
I wanted Jin/gin and tonic, she brought me Dumbfoundead and a glass of water
Yo, but the way I'll body him, you'll think Solomon had a rematch Jin
But his hygiene's so bad that his teeth match his skin
He tries to get close to nature and meditates to control his anger
So I'm not talking Dhalsim when I say he's a yoga flamer
We think that we're your friendly northern neighbors
Til I treat you like the logo from the Oakland Raiders
Stab your head with both the sabers
And it's ironic that you're Asian and you can't make tracks
But all your bright ideas seem dimmer in your lamp shade hats
So dead the drama Johnny
The only thing you ever killed was Tamagotchi's
This fucking backstabber would've been the kamikaze bombing Nazi's
And you nominate Perez Hilton for Man Of The Year
But we don't need the Black Eyed Peas' manager here to knock out Los Angeles queers
You only pull cards in Yugioh
You only wrap/rap raw making sushi rolls
Does anyone else recognize him from his movie role?
Rufio!

[Round 2: Dumbfoundead]
Y'all should've seen him from his Battle Of The Bay, he was such a fanboy
I saw his hands point at Dirtbag Dan's groin
Whispering to Loe Pesci like "The whole Fresh scene is so sexy."
You might as well be repping the FreshCoast
Before any of that we need to get you some men's clothes
Resembling Glenn Close
Yo, I saw that battle with you and Fresco
That shit was very mean
It was hands-down the most vicious cat fight I've ever seen
You got even more pumped up when his bros were cheering
Took his heels off and told Organik, "Hold my earrings"
I know your kind, you won mad science fairs has bad sinus flares
When you found out I was coming to town you were like, "Man I am there!"
Yo, he's infatuated with my people, an Asian culture geek
A petite physique with a vulture's beak
You see, he knows more about Asians than me and Tantrum
He's the one who taught me the Korean anthem
You would fantasize about having slanted eyes
And calls himself "The Last Samurai"
Not to mention he suped up his mom's station wagon
With stickers of flaming dragons
And soon as I came inside he gave me five and yelled "Asian pride"
I asked him, "Yo, ain't you white?" because of his pigmentation
And he made up his own race and told me he was "Canasian"

[Round 2: Kid Twist]
I'm not referencing his name when I say this kid's a dummy
And me and Fresco was a cat fight, you watched it and started getting hungry
And Koreans are just Chinese people who got lost
So your country is knockoff of a country of knockoffs
And I nailed your mom at the nail salon
She moaned deeper than Rah Digga
The last time she screamed at something that big coming it was Godzilla
Yo, this bitch is wired like Asian fight scenes
And the shape of his eyes mean every film this guy's seen is in wide screen
You might've watched this gay lose to James Juice and Frankie Waps
Then afterwards they wrestled in a handicapped bra and panties match
And Madness said my real voice sounds auto-tuned
But when I rock with you, you make me sound chopped and screwed
Yo look, you have zero street cred and run with new jack tweekers
So how do you rep the stars and stripes when your crew has neither?
And I know I'm pretty skinny but hey
You look like a vegan bulimic who's been coke binging for days
Which proves you're a bitch from L.A

[Round 3: Dumbfoundead]
The O.G.'s in Canada told me the scoop
How you love Swollen Members and I don't mean the group
This man loves blowing the flute...if you know what I'm talking aboot
When he was a kid there was a toy he really wanted and just had to have it
Y'all know that one joint: Bop it, pull it, Twist it, faggot
I call this dude "gay" and this bastard got all pissed
Started rallies, lifting fists yelling "Faggot will resist!"
Calm the fuck down, don't get your panties in a Twist
Yo Vaginaville clothing is sponsoring this battle and he doesn't even care
Instead he supports their rival company by rocking Peniswear
Ayo what a surprise you removed the highlights from your hair
Cause I remember in the movie Twilight it was there
That was like the highlight of your career
What the hell have you seen?
You make your revenue stream on your daily routine of selling poutine
I will fuck your mom and kiss your sister
They way they work the tongue I should call 'em "Ms and Mrs. Twister"
And all you motherfuckers is calling me a "comedian"
I would chew up gun rappers and throw away the gum rapper
And make the angry, screaming motherfuckers have lung cancer
Make the smart, neardy motherfuckers seem dumb after
Make the O.G.'s seem young after
Dumb has mastered all styles you dumb bastard
So don't judge a book by it's cover, this is just one chapter

[Verse 3: Kid Twist]
Bitch! You sound like a nerdy voice, surfer boy, piece of white trash
You're like the Jabbawockeez, an Asian in a white mask
Your free flows weak bro
But you should hear his hit song, "Me so Emo"
But fuck Sin City this is T.O. meho
And I heard you jacked the track of another wack wannabe
You owe the I Love College beat an apology
Who the fuck are you, Asia Roth?
You crazy sauce
Since when does Gwen Stefani let those Harajuku ladies talk?
And Dumb calls his crew the Swim Team
If you ask me it was a dumb call
Cause I'll give your bitch a breast stroke then fuck her while she's in the front crawl
But you only give her cyber sex
So I'm something you can't pass like a North Korean boarder sniper's nest
Or a driver's test
Look, and people hate the states for your arrogant actions
To the rest of the world, YOU'RE the terrorist faction
Trying to take over the globe in an Aryan fashion
That's something we won't stand for like the American Anthem
