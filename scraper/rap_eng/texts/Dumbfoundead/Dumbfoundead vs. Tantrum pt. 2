You need to quit being so awfully dandy
Just the way you talk like a pansy you dishonor our family
And you’re straight thrash I hope you fucking die in a plane crash
Just for looking like a gay ass a-class
And he’s better than you, you phony old prick
He ain’t even in that tokyo drift he in that hokey poke shit
And I don’t think your rap sheet is serious
You’re known as the asian blowdian who take a backseat to lyraflip
And you ain’t nothing but a whack rounding piece of shit
So stop rapping. Flat line or eat a dick
He wrote an autobiography on his past life of being whipped
It’s called the memoirs of sahtyre’s geisha bitch
See over here you get ate up in a hot stew
It’s your destiny there ain’t no saving you from god’s rule
You’re in the bay bitch when your face turn into dog food
There’s room for only one dope asian and it’s not you

[Dumbfoundead]
Yo I didn’t wanna go into overtime but I will since I have to
I guarantee you this motherfucker has a dragon or tiger tattoo
So which one is it?
Like a chinese phone number with 6 more digits
Trust you can’t rhyme as tight as me
I roll with a crew you roll with a dynasty
I’m holding a brew you holding a thai iced tea
I caught you in berkeley wearing a tye dye tee
This guy’s real name has like 9 x’s in it
Xie xie xing it’s like jar jar binks
Coming in here with your work clothes
There’s only one dope asian rapper per coast
Ok and the position has been filled
So go battle in tourrettes forever cuz you’ll never be put on a bill
Trust me I don’t give a fuck if this guy’s korean chinese or vietnamese
Cuz your ass is weak to me
And I will serve you until all our people see
That you should not have made the fresh coast DVD
Yo I don’t give a fuck if this dude’s a baller wearing all bling
I don’t care if he’s a gangster part of wa ching
I don’t care if this motherfucker calls the police on me or calls sting
Cuz battling is all you have and I just crushed your small dreams
