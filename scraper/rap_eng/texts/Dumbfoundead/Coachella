That's right uh

This is for all my festival freaks
This is for my festival fleeks
[Repeat]

Drink water
Have sex
Smoke a lot of weed
[Repeat]

It's me!
Iâ€™m channeling the matador
And I'm sensing all your bullshit
You must think I'm out of luck
Pushing all my buttons, it don't do shit
Get over yourself
When I'm sober, I'm hell
I hit the keys
I'm talking drugs
No Patti LaBelle
Over deal, can you tell me [?]

[Hook]
My money's so wavy, I'm rolling the bends
My pockets' Coachella, about 50 bands
About 50 bands
My pockets' Coachella, my pockets' Coachella (about 50 bands!)
I'ma go get her
My pockets' Coachella, my pockets' Coachella

I feel like the Pac hologram
Brap brap brap brap! Not a damn thing could touch me
Got your girl like the Fresh Prince episode
Crying like why don't he want me, man why don't he want me?
This ain't Uncle Phil though, we talking about some real dough
This ain't the Screen Actors Guild no
This the shit that we bleed and we sweat and we kill for
I turn the introvert bitch to a sextrovert (she a superfreak)
She's sending me pictures, please don't kill the messenger
I'm talking bands more than festival regulars
Festival freaks wearing turquoise and lavender, turquoise and lavender

[Hook]
