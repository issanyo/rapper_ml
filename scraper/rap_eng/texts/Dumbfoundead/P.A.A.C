[Intro]
Protect at all cost
Protect from the op
Channel my Pac
I might catch a body, I put that on God
Protect all the youth
Don’t push they’ll shoot
Off of the juice
'92 Riots got gooks
On the top of the roof

[Chorus x2]
Protect at all cost, protect at all cost
Protect at all cost, protect at all cost
P.A.A.C, P.A.A.C, P.A.A.C, P.A.A.C
Protect at all cost, protect at all cost

[Verse 1]
Bombs over Baghdad
Missiles over Atlantic
They put the world into panic
We in a whirlwind of Xanax
I'm dying, yelling out "Fuck you"
Better find you some refuge
Don't trust no priest to come bless you
Ain't no police to the rescue
Teflon for my loved ones
Going Rambo on a fuckboy redrum
Protect the name of my dead ones
Let the fo'-fo' sing along from the lungs
Come get some
Protect like a magnum
Protect with a handgun
Protecting my grandsons
Protect ya neck like Wu-Tang Clan
That's a brand new anthem
(Salute)

[Pre-Chorus]
In love and war, all is fair yuh
Never counted on a prayer, yuh
When all is said and done
You know I held you down
Can't say I was never there, yuh

[Chorus x2]
Protect at all cost, protect at all cost
Protect at all cost, protect at all cost
P.A.A.C, P.A.A.C, P.A.A.C, P.A.A.C
Protect at all cost, protect at all cost

[Verse 2]
Protecting my fam like Lil B
Curse all my enemies' energy
I need my remedy
Give me my Ritalin
Focus on hitting them with my heat
Punch a Nazi in the jaw
Tiki torches on the floor
Fuck the forces and the law
I'ma break the fucking wall
Don't trust the banks either
Keep it under Tempur-Pedic
Take a knee, now pledge allegiance
Fuck police, I'm heavy breathing
Money like I'm Ebenezer
Keep the balance like a Libra
Earn my stripes like I'm a zebra
Gave the country yellow fever

[Pre-Chorus]
All of my relatives militant
Pulled up on boats like we young again
We just some ignorant immigrants
Dare ya to try to get rid of them
Protect, Code Red
All threats must be stopped
Protect, forehead
Red dot, headshot

[Chorus x2]
Protect at all cost, Protect at all cost
Protect at all cost, Protect at all cost
P.A.A.C, P.A.A.C, P.A.A.C, P.A.A.C
Protect at all cost, Protect at all cost
