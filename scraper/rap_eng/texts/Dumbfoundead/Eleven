[Intro]
I don’t wanna die (Yeah)

[Verse 1]
At 14 I was wild dog
Lifestyles of a child star
Maculy Caulkin in the town car
Nah, this ain't the Mickey Mouse Club
Never really like the outdoors
My plug always made house calls
Had to meet him by the intercom
Now he bring the pack to the top floor (Brrt, Brrt)
Bring it up, even my plug said I’m doing too much
Give me that bag, you talkin' too much
I got a shorty tryna fuck
I’m like Jordan with these drugs
Yea I mastered all my highs
Boy you passed out on the couch
Try to catch up 'cause you fry
Hercules, Hercules, yea I’m flexin' got work with me
Walk through duty-free, worry free
There’s like five of her, one of me
I’m on eleven like Stranger Things
Party and bullshit my favorite things
Bitch we brought back the seventies
They like watch you on, everything

[Chorus]
One out of ten, I’m on eleven
One out of ten, I’m on eleven
One out of ten, I’m on eleven (I'm on eleven)
I’m on a binge, closer to heaven

One out of ten, I’m on eleven
One out of ten, I’m on eleven
One out of ten, I’m on eleven (I'm on eleven)
I’m on a binge, closer to heaven

I’m on eleven (Hey, yeah)
Made it outta 27 (I don’t wanna die)

[Verse 2]
Off of the Henny, off of the beans
Walking’ on water, I’m talkin' to Jesus
I need to breathe, I need to chill
That shit is beatin’ like heart of a cheetah
I got a mill, I’m gettin' reckless
This shit a film, I’m on the credits
Want this feelin to last forever
And not wash away like henna
I’m a mile away from heaven
Like a painting out in venice
Got a black card with no limit
Feels like I ain't use no Jimmy
Got a chick out in the UK, feelin' brilliant, (brilliant)
This is poetry in motion call me William, (William)
We poppin' pills like Orville, vision shaky like clover field
Asian bitches here rollin' bills
And doin lines like football fields
Shout out yungin' and half-a-mil
We bring the fire like the Napa Hills
We bring the drank and it never spills
If you if you ask me how I feel well

[Chorus]
One out of ten, I’m on eleven
One out of ten, I’m on eleven
One out of ten, I’m on eleven (I'm on eleven)
I’m on a binge, closer to heaven

One out of ten, I’m on eleven
One out of ten, I’m on eleven
One out of ten, I’m on eleven (I'm on eleven)
I’m on a binge, closer to heaven

I’m on eleven (I’m on one)
Made it outta 27 (I made it out alive)

[Post-Chorus]
Somebody call the reverend (Only one way out)
My soul is out my body (One outta ten)

I’m on eleven (and i’m going for the kill)
I’m on eleven (I’m on a whole 'nother realm)
I’m on eleven (Got these angels all around me)
I’m on eleven (Fallen angels from the hills)
Made it out of 27

I’m on eleven
I’m on eleven
I’m on eleven
