[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Waking up to instrumentals playing, Smoke up in the ceiling fan
Complicated wordplay but really I'm a simple man
I like my weather good, I like my women hood
I keep it one hundred, and get misunderstood
Don't get my words twisted now, we ain't all the same
Some got a silver spoon, others have a ball and chain
Some wish you all the best, some wish you all the pain
Life's a game and I'm trying to make the hall of fame
This society asks you to pick a side
Every minute of your life, three hundred and sixty five
Red or blue, big or small, yes or no, right or wrong
The difference between the two is the feeling of I belong
Yeah, we in the middle of all this
The temperature's rising like the middle of August
They litter the airwaves, you pick up the garbage
Big dreams coming out this little apartment

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
All I know is keep it cool
I stay calm
They ask me "How you do that?" "What is this fool on?"
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
It's the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on track
All I know is keep it cool
I stay calm
They ask me "How you do that?" "What is this fool on?"
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
It's the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on track

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Never reached six digits in my bank account
Credit score red, same color that I paint the town
Three month relationship, tells me she can't wait around
You can break me down, as long as my fam's safe and sound
I keep the weed lit, and keep my glass full
I call it real talk, they call it asshole
I call it on the grind, she calls it selfish
She needs me all the time, I call her helpless
Is it a problem that I don't care
Maybe that's the reason that I'm stuck at almost there, it's no fair
On this path, there's no warnings or road flares
All is fair in love games and warfare
Another underdog story for the books
But I promise that the story is as foreign as I look
Waiting at the bus stop to touring on a bus
When the going gets tough, I keep it up

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
All I know is keep it cool
I stay calm
They ask me "How you do that?" "What is this fool on?"
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
It's the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on track
All I know is keep it cool
I stay calm
They ask me "How you do that?" "What is this fool on?"
A little bit of this, a little bit of that
It's the whole lot of nothing that keeps me on track
