[Verse 1: Jeff Bernat]
See, I be in the studio this evening
Then rockin' at a show somewhere tonight
In the morning I'll be on a plane to Paris
Just to hit the Fashion Week insides

[Verse 2: Jeff Bernat]
And although I might be working all day
Although I might be coming home late
Don't you worry about a thing
So just as long as you know that

[Hook: Jeff Bernat]
8 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 5 o'clock, all day
I'm grinding
On the clock, off the clock, round the clock
I stay grinding
Then I'll be catching up with folks on Friday
And grab a couple drinks on Saturday
Breakfast with the fam on Sunday then
Monday comes and I'm back up on my grind again

[Verse 3: dumbfounded]
Yeah, it's only Tuesday
Can you try to turn up, girl?
I need to get this track done
And turn it in by tomorrow
You getting days mixed up
Like Tia and Tamara
I can see you in the weekend
Or just pull a chair up

My work ethic, ethic is second to none, none
She want me to sex her so bad, she want some
Ok, maybe I'll take a small break
And give my lady some loving
Then back to plug-in, so she's so stubborn
I'll be back afterwards, getting on a rapper's nerves
Slowing down this song like a glass of purp
But me and Jeff Bernat don't play that game
And I'll put you where the curb at if you behave that way
Let's work

[Hook: Jeff Bernat]
8 o'clock, 1 o'clock, 5 o'clock, all day
I'm grinding
On the clock, off the clock, round the clock
I stay grinding
Then I'll be catching up with folks on Friday
And grab a couple drinks on Saturday
Breakfast with the fam on Sunday then
Monday comes and I'm back up on my grind again
