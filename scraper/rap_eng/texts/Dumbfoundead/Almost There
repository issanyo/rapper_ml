[Intro]
They tell me take a number
But I can’t wait no longer
I'm over going under and enough
Have stole my thunder
Underestimated
Know one day I'mma  reach you
From going south of pico to the
Top of Machu Pichu

[Chorus]
Almost there, I was almost there
Felt it with both hands
You shoulda been there
Life is so unfair, but I'm on my sun chair
No I ain't high yet but I'm almost there

[Verse 1]
I want you front row when I
Get it watch me go to the top
Ain't no reason to be jealous no one
Forced you to stop
Up until the rolling credits
Ain't no holes in this plot
And I promise I'ma take my whole squad, yea
What you know about levelling up, homie
They said its never enough, slowly
I got my heads out the clouds, OGs
Buried their heads in the dust, roadies
Now in the back of my bus, throwing
Money it's nothing to us
This ain't a blush, baby I'm drunk
This is that Asian American flush
Underachiever, out in Geneva
I can’t believe I'm lucky as fuck
I use to squeeze like five in a Kia
While one of us jumped in the trunk
Picture me rollin', I'm feelin' like Pac
No I ain’t the new kid on the block
All of the homies askin' are we there yet
I tell em, be there on the dot

[Chorus]
Almost there, I was almost there
Felt it with both hands
You shoulda been there
Life is so unfair, but I'm on my sun chair
No I ain't high yet but I'm almost there

[Verse 2: Paloalto]
내 level은 most high 보살
매봉역 앞에다 세워놔 동상
난 영감을 줬지 네 조상
벗어나려 해봐도 내 손바닥
하늘을 찌르는 욕망이
내 한계를 깨게 해 떡상
오직 평화 친구 덤파
정말 가까이 보이는 정상
별의 별 꼴 다 겪어서
난 안 떨어져 더 강해졌어
서울특별시에 별이 떴어
등반을 했지 나는 저 밑에서
Koreatown엔 별 일 없어?
이 가사를 통해서 편지를 써
우린 다 연결돼 어디서든
의심은 하지마 hundred percent
Almost there
Success 두려움 모조리 없애
내 곁에 있었던 철새들 곤란했을 때 모른 채
용서해도 이젠 절대
함께 할 리 없을 거야 평생
다 보여 꾸며낸 가짜 컨셉
내가 들춰내면 너넨 좆돼

[Chorus]
Almost there, I was almost there
Felt it with both hands
You shoulda been there
Life is so unfair, but I'm on my sun chair
No I ain't high yet but I'm almost there

[Verse 3]
I need preservatives
I don't care how they interpret it, I need my permanence
I put in way too much work for this
I put my hands and my feet in the dirt for this
I don't want to wait no, no
I've been always stuck in almost, no-go's
Lord knows that my soul so frustrated from being so close
It was the ‘life of the band’
It was who could survive through the land
Taking turns driving, having all-nighters in the back of dry cleaner vans
Getting In fights, thighs getting crammed
Paying for gas and nights that we're staying
We came home with less money but felt we invested right for the fans
Damn

[Verse 4]
Life has indeed been unfair
But we’re takin' this straight to the top, havin' taken the pain that we needed to bear
They said this our callin', but maybe it’s not
They say that it’s hot, til the day that it’s not, uh
Any day is the day it could stop, uh
And when that day comes then you're washed, spit out and then mopped up
Products, limited supply like pop-ups
Even if somehow we popped off the system has been designed to stop us
Different this time, we’ve climbed up, jumped off
Minds done, evolved
Cus' the times are changing every day
So I guess it’s time to pull off, YOX
