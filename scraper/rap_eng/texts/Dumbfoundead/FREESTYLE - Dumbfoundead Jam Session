Intro:
Yeah, yo, yo
Hello everybody it’s nice to meet and greet you
It’s cool when everybody wants to be you
Life from the motherfucking green room
Yeah, life from the motherfucking green room, yeah

Verse 1:
I can rap in English, Korean, or Hebrew
Motherfuckers see through, they just wanna be you
Pyoo, you suck, trust me, bust a free out
My freestyles is ugly, rough like rugby
Nobody wants to touch me, girls leaving they scrunchie
Right by my bunk bed, i’ll leave you with a shrunk head
Thats why we do it man, I got the music man
So pass it to Tim, just do it man

Verse 2:
I’ll rip you up, like some Swisher guts
You gone need some friends to stitch you up
Got that smooth, mustache tip of an acrylic brush
I’ll make a million bucks, calling Regis Philbin up
Thats my final answer, i’m just that rhyming cancer
All up in your body, better get that chemo, we go
Way back before people called me chino, latinos
On the block tho, got that fuckin hot flow
You be falling off like a pot hole
I rock flows like Rocko’s, modern life
I got these stripes like a cheetah
Cuz I’m faster than a cheetah, i’m faster than
Vegeta with adidas on the track field
I don’t give a fuck, I just wanna slap grills
Yo, you ain’t on my fuckin level tho
I don’t need no metronome, I eat all my vegetables
I’m just fuckin strong as hell, carrots and them lettuce shit
I don’t give a fuck, cuz this rhyming is my fetish shit
I get fuckin addicted, this ain’t fuckin fiction
This is all fact, you get all slapped, jaw cracked
This is like Comcast, broadcast, all up in the stereo
Do it from my body, yo, I work it out cardio
All night, all day, bars like Klondike
Every single night like a prom night
Massage on the left hand, or right hand
I work for the white man, hipster with them tight pants
I don’t give a fuck, cuz, never fuckin right man
This is all freestyle, Emcees get beat down, in 3 rounds
With that knockout, the left hook, the right hook
I write hooks, and write songs, I like bongs
I like kush
