[Chorus]
Let's go out, let's do something
Let's get high, go in public
Go get lost in the moment
If you trust me, you'll love it
Yeah, let's get weird (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay ya)
Yeah, let's get weird (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay ya)

[Verse 1]
Middle fingers high, to the basic
I know you tired of the same shit, ain't ya
I turn a boring ass night to a banquet
What's a dollar when you feel Ben Franklin
Baby don't be a worrier, I'mma make you a warrior
I'mma give you tutorials on a state of euphoria
Took a bean, now I'm seeing like three or four of ya
Life isn't choreo, go and live it notorious and
Dance to your own beat
Yeah, first time hittin OG damn
But you seem like an OG
Way you ain't let the smoke leave
I'm a low-key stan
Yeah, let's get weird
Let's go trip
Don't trip, I'm here
It's all we have right now right here
And when we're done, hope things ain't weird

[Chorus]
Let's go out, let's do something
Let's get high, go in public
Go get lost in the moment
If you trust me, you'll love it
Yeah, let's get weird (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay ya)
Turn this world into a fun house mirror
Yeah, let's get weird (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay ya)
Wave your freak flags high up in the air (yeah)

[Verse 2]
I have no more fucks to give away (no no no)
Stopped caring long ago what people had to say about us
Take two of these and take this leap of faith
And see some different shades of colors, what's this world without us
Tap into your freak, inner geek, inner weirdo
You ain't got to give in cause the world so fearful
They be on your nuts later when you become CEO
Gone through enough haters you ain't gotta be alone
Got the skyscrapers looking like the fireflies
Like we on a Milky Way speeding on the I-5
Tryna get your mind off thinkin' 'bout the wifi
No need for pictures when the memories are not dying
Turnt an introvert to an instant flirt
Don't ever wanna ever see you insecure
Now she walk into the room, the attention's hers
Yeah you gon' get this work
You gon' get this work from me
Everything been black and white
Now it's high resolution we gon paint the night, neon
So hang on, ain't playin' safe tonight
Put this on your tongue girl and get a taste of life

[Chorus]
Let's go out, let's do something
Let's get high, go in public
Go get lost in the moment
If you trust me, you'll love it
Yeah, let's get weird (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay ya)
Turn this world into a fun house mirror
Yeah, let's get weird (ay, ay, ay, ay, ay ya)
Wave your freak flags high up in the air

[Refrain]
Let's get weird, fuck your fears
We gonna turn this world into a fun house mirror
Let's get weird
Let 'em all stare
Freak flags up, middle fingers in the air, like

[Outro: Clara C]
Let's get high
Let's get weird
(Let's get) wild
Leave me here
High, let's do something
Let's get (high go in public)
Leave me (lost in the moment)
Trust me you'll love it
(Let's get)
(Let's get)
