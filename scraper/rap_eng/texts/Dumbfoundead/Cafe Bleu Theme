[Chorus]
Don't let all the cold air in
Looks we're all back again
If you're feeling broken down
Well I know a little place in town
Cafe Bleu
Cafe Bleu

[Verse 1]
Neon lights and velvet couches like a casting call
The glass is clinking in the whispers from the bathroom stalls
Half a block from Chapman Plaza come and sip with squad
It's a painful lonely small world after all
See and do your dark side like a black light
You don't have to ride alone in this fast life
Full house and a happy hour, half price
Baby we won't let you flat-line

[Chorus]
Don't let all the cold air in
Looks we're all back again
If you're feeling broken down
Well I know a little place in town
Cafe Bleu
Cafe Bleu

[Verse 2]
Misery loves company, I love my friends to death
Everything is everything, when you have nothing left
Lovers become enemies and leaves you with the check
When everybody knows your name, and everyone else forgets
When everyone else forgets you, this blue come through
When everyone else forgets you, this blue

[Chorus]
Don't let all the cold air in
Looks we're all back again
If you're feeling broken down
Well I know a little place in town
Cafe Bleu
Cafe Bleu
