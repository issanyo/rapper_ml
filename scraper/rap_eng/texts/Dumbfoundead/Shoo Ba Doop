[Hook]
Shoo Ba Doop
You can't touch me when I sing this song
Shoo Ba Doop Doop
And can't nobody do me wrong, no
One thing about music
When it hits you, you feel no pain
That's why I sing, Shoo Ba Doop Doop
And I'm a sing it til it's time to go home, baby

[Verse 1: Wax]
It's just another usual morning
I'm hung the fuck over in my cubicle snoring
All of a sudden, out the blue with no warning
My boss comes by to review my performance
He's yapping bout my attitude and how poor it is
And the size of my headache done grew to enormous
Damn, what can I do to avoid this?
I hate this fucking job it's so stupid and pointless
I tune out the humans with voices
And my mind plays games like computers with joysticks
I start thinking about a beautiful chorus
With musical chords that are suitable for this moment
And you can fire me on the spot
I clear my desk feeling irey bombaclot
Cause I'm ain't trying to be something I'm not
But I can't lose it, I need this job, cue the music

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
I'm at the restaurant bussing away dishes
Pissed off cause the customers ain't tipping
I missed a spot and the manager starts tripping
But I can't hear em, the beats on my iPod's kicking
All I can do at work is think about rhyme patterns
One handed while I'm juggling nine platters
It's something I do as a time passer
It makes shit that I hate to do go by faster
Man, I'm always stuck cleaning the restrooms it isn't fair
But I don't really care, acoustics are better there
And when it's time to close, it's a private show
Restock while I rock mops like a microphone
Yeah, the night's are long and the pays weak
But I don't complain, that ain't how momma raised me
Nothing can phase me, I'm loving the blues
Everyday I punch in and start humming this tune

[Hook x2]

[Outro: Wax]
Sing it like this Shoo Ba Doop
When that annoying co-worker spends too much time at your desk
Just sing it like this
Shoo Ba Doop Doop
If you delivering pizza and you can't find the address
Just sing it like this
Shoo Ba Doop
If your doing landscaping and the weather outside is a mess
Just sing it like this
Shoo Ba Doop Doop
And I'm a sing it til it's time to go home baby
