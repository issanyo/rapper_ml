[Intro: Dumbfoundead]
Hair blue, Sailor Moon

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Hair blue, Sailor Moon
I pass the J like an heirloom
She anime, she hentai
My tentacles on her bare womb
Rejects out of art school
The seat's wet that's a carpool
Ran through the reds like Marlboros
Met a bitch, got me hard like gargoyles
Hunted mouse running through the avenues
Crazy like a motherfucking animal
Dashboard crashing up an adderall
Ran through the 3-6 catalogue
Swoop another jones, knocking over cones
Flipping off the pigs, fuck em, don't trust em
Knocking over drugs, gotta text the plug
Kicking out the bitch, bust it or bus it

[Hook: Nocando, *Dumbfoundead*]
*Hit (hit), run*
They always think we up to something
*Hit (hit), run*
Most likely 'cause we up to something
*Hit (hit), run*
I'm out here living my life
Staying out of mind out of sight
But they try to fuck my right of way
*Hit (hit), run*
Running red lights on a suicide mission
*Hit (hit), run*
I swear the universe is on my side
*Hit (hit), run*
If it ain't bitches up in this hop out of my ride
Pull up on the devil and look in his eyes
I been down this road

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Road head from a Lohan
Got us geeked up, white girl, got us up with the birds
Love from the 'burbs, Xans in the purse
Using every bit of trust fund from my parents
Fuck what you heard, my dick on Yelp
Got 5 stars and it's own championship belt
Been getting pussy since the bottom of the bill
Got a pretty little thing in my automobile
God take control of the wheel
Starting to feel all the pills, I need to chill
Feel like a new hundred bill
Roll it up into a straw
Who tryna' chill
I keep my cash in an urn
Cause I got money to burn, y'all need to learn
They call me dummy, come take something from me
Put enemy's heads on the curbs

[Hook: Nocando, *Dumbfoundead*]
*Hit (hit), run*
They always think we up to something
*Hit (hit), run*
Most likely 'cause we up to something
*Hit (hit), run*
I'm out here living my life
Staying out of mind out of sight
But they try to fuck my right of way
*Hit (hit), run*
Running red lights on a suicide mission
*Hit (hit), run*
I swear the universe is on my side
*Hit (hit), run*
If it ain't bitches up in this hop out of my ride
Pull up on the devil and look in his eyes
I been down this road

[Verse 3: Nocando]
My ex got my name on her tramp stamp area
Make a new man sick like some bad bacterias
Beating on the table in the damn cafeteria
20 years later I'm a world class nigga
Going far like a nigga in a stolen car with a full tank
Full rank, no regards
To your motherfucking feelings are a stoplight
Black lives never mattered fucking cops right? (Right?)
Hit and run like a  uninsured immigrant
Not sure if that's dumb or that's ignorant
Not sure if Iâ€™m numb or ambivalent
Done where I thought my insurance is
I smell like pussy and whiskey and cigarettes
It's a hit and run, baby no girlfriend experience

[Hook: Nocando, *Dumbfoundead*]
*Hit (hit), run*
They always think we up to something
*Hit (hit), run*
Most likely 'cause we up to something
*Hit (hit), run*
I'm out here living my life
Staying out of mind out of sight
But they try to fuck my right of way
*Hit (hit), run*
Running red lights on a suicide mission
*Hit (hit), run*
I swear the universe is on my side
*Hit (hit), run*
If it ain't bitches up in this hop out of my ride
Pull up on the devil and look in his eyes
I been down this road

[Outro: Dumbfoundead]
Hit (hit), run [x4]
