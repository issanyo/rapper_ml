Good morning! Granola Bars
Bars after bars, you would've sworn a pharmacy
Was giving out jars of this stuff without carding me
Djarum with a cardigan on, man I was born to be
Bond, Sean Connery doing bodily harm, yeah
Lady in my arm, she stuck to me like a starfish
In a whip so ill, swear that I'm getting carsick
Drivin' down La Brea tinted windows like a tar pit
Lit cigarillo armadillo on that hard shit
Bar-barbarian chillin' in Barbados
With a Barbie at a bar while barbequing these lame-os
With the same old styles that are way old
Need to get that new-new cruise down rodeo
Shout out to Richlee chillin' out in Long Beach
Power to the people that be occupying Wall Street
Murdered the beat, it's in the coffin with Gaddafi
You bitches talk a lot, but now you're barkin' up the wrong tree
Michel Gondry, vision on that other shit
Goddamn I be goin' HAM like I cut a pig
Fuck a ho, fuck a bitch, you be on that cuddle shit
I ain't gon' stop 'til I'm swimmin' in a money pit
Knocksteady, we go hard in the paint
Yeah, starvin' recording, puttin' heart in my tapes
Swisher grapes in the morning to start off the day
Get your bars up now that the bar has been raised
