[Verse 1: DFD]
Feel the pressure, yeah I feel the pressure
When I'm the one who speaks in the voice of my ancestors
And the homies out on Western are saying they'll represent us
So I'm forever tatted, fuck a temporary henna
It's a privilege to pursue my happiness, cause my crew
Got a list of things to do before dreaming about the future;
Running the family business, handling father sickness
All the sacrifices given, I'm doing this all for you
It's a letter to my homies, you will never have to owe me
Buying bottles, karaoke with a couple model tomes
Fuck the police
Cuffing you, your wrist will have a Rollie
Trying to write a happy ending to the story

[Pre-Hook: DFD]
I guess this is a going-away letter
I ain't coming back to town 'till I'm doing like way better
Don't be offended when phone calls go to voicemails
The flight attendant asked me to turn it off, that's real

[Hook: DFD](2x)
I'm bringing gold to me city, who's with me?
Gold watches for my people, did you miss me?
Bought them all off the jeweler by the pound
A couple karats turn this bitch into 24K-Town

[Verse 2: DFD]
Where'd you go? They're asking me where I went
Gone for a couple months, but it feels like I barely left
Everybody is a statue that froze at their last step
Every weekend is a celebration of the past-tense
My brothers with resolutions
My sister with no excuses
I salute ya'
Let's go and make some moments in the future
I ain't saying I'm Confucius, I'm confused as much as ya'll
Another student of life, I just studied abroad
Normally I'd be on Normandie, but normal is done,
It ain't about repping inside, but outside where you're from
When they're drunk, they yell it from the top of their lungs
But over drums, they'll hear it for generations to come (K-Town)

[Pre-Hook: DFD]
I guess this is a going-away letter
I ain't coming back to town 'till I'm doing like way better
Don't be offended when phone calls go to voicemails
The flight attendant asked me to turn it off, that's real

24K-Town, bringing gold to my city

[Hook: DFD](2x)
I'm bringing gold to me city, who's with me?
Gold watches for my people, did you miss me?
Bought them all off the jeweler by the pound
A couple karats turn this bitch into 24K-Town
