[Intro]
Somebody tell em we in town, plus we got plenty of trees to go around
Ca-came from the hood the hood, I'm so proud
When I say I'm good, I'm good for ten rounds
Ten

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Two shots and a mixer
Two-o'clock in the after-hours
I was, too hood for them hipsters
Two drops when I'm popping mollies
I, raise the volume, close my eyelids, off them hybrids, autopilot
How did I flip, this lifestyle?
Green lights take flight like a night owl
Savage, gotta have it
Catch me in the cab gettin' blown like the cannon
Look no hands! Goin' H.A.M. on a bad chick
Said she got a man, said this shit never happened
It's the ruler, tatted like the Yakuza
Flyer than parachuters, and waviest barracudas
Turn this party into a nudest colony with a pool of
Bitches giving me medulla oblongata, I'm a school her

[Hook]
Somebody tell em we in town, plus we got plenty of trees to go around
Ca-can the hood the hood, I'm so proud
When I say I'm good, I'm good for ten rounds
Ten rounds, at least ten rounds
Any given show, at least ten thou
Ca-can the hood the hood, I'm so proud
When I say I'm good, I'm good for ten rounds

[Verse 2]
Neighborhood king, oh you know me right?
Late nights spent at the corners until the morning light
You don't blow tree, but ya rollin', right?
You just want to take a photo, right?
Ok, fresh in my white Nike prototypes
So what's the guest list
We kickin' down the door tonight
And make em' fuckin' with the best-est
I'd be wrong if I said I wasn't taking something home tonight
Drinking to the bottom of the bottle, when you put your bottom dollar that she coming to the condo
She a Spanish mama goin' though some drama with her man, now she calling me her sancho

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ok, fresh in my white Nike prototypes
So what's the guest list
We kickin' down the door tonight
Man you fuckin' with the best-est
I'd be wrong if I said I wasn't taking something home tonight
Fresh in my white Nike prototypes
So what's the guest list
We kickin' down the door tonight
Man you fuckin' with the best-est
I'd be wrong if I said I wasn't taking something home tonight

[Hook]

[Outro]
Somebody tell em we in town, plus we got plenty of trees to go around *Outro fades out*
*Intro beat begins* Somebody tell em we in town, plus we got plenty of trees to go around
