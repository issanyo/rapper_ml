Cockblockers

(Intro)
Since the beginning of time there have always been evil forces against men who have attempted to sleep with women

These evil forces are commonly referred to as "Cockblockers"

Three specific kinds of cockblockers eventually join forces to hate
These are the stories of their attempts and their victims

Fat Friend:
(She don't fuck with stupid asses like you ay)

Guy Friend:
(If I can't have her nobody can, but I'll never tell her)

And Family Member:
(Ay nah fuck that shit that's my little sister fool)

(Dumbfoundead)
(Verse 1)

You ever holla at a chick that you probably gone hit and then all of a suddenly become a cock block victim?
They get right between you two before the shot clock gets them
That's them cockblockers usually her fat friend
She'll pop out of nowhere when you're grabbin at her back end or try to leave the party with her when it's barely past ten
She'll whisper in her ear like (He ain't even worth it let's go somewhere else you can find a better person)
She's all up in her business so I throw her ass a biscuit (Here catch)
Now she's even more pissed so it turns in her mission to keep her at a distance what a fucking hater
Should of brought myself a homie that's a chubby chaser
Later I'll page her and bypass her body guard
Meet her somewhere secret and take her someplace really far
Away from distractions to get into the hotspot
Away from her fat friend man I hate a cock block

(Chorus)
Man I hate a cock block (x3)

(Verse 2)

So I'm chillin with this hot girl smokin on a one hitter along comes her guy friend who is secretly in love with her
It's obvious to me that he finds me a threat cause what I did in ten minutes he spent his life to attempt (Ha Ha)
He's stuck in the friend zone the one she can depend on
Cockblockin just so I won't make it to the endzone (Score)
To be this type of cat you gotta have a lot of patience
Straight up rolled uninvited right into our conversation
He was trying hint to me that he had a thing for her sitting right between us and putting his arm around her shoulder
This guy was a pro like he's been doing this for years saving all her hair strands like stalker souvenirs
He hates that she dates assholes on the real
Never had the balls to tell her how he really feels
He tried to be a hotshot eventually he got socked
Knock Knock (Who's There)
Man I hate a cockblock

(Chorus)
Man I hate a cockblock (x3)

(Verse 3)

I'm spittin game to a dime that I'm trying to have sex with
Here comes the big brother overly protective
She tells me that he's crazy
(He's Crazy)
Which I'm not impressed with
Either way I try my best to make a good impression
I know that he ain't dumb
I'm from the LA slums just the type of guy he wants her to stay away from
So he keeps her locked up in her room all weekend
But she'll sneak out during night time while her family is sleeping

Cockblockers there's always ways to defeat them
You can't stop a woman when she's out there trying to meet men
Hormones rage and pheromones play
But there's villains trying to stop this
Making sure you don't mate
It's jealously or hate cause they ain't getting any
So thinking if I'm asked out Imma take you with me
But I ain't really trippin cause all women have a soft spot

There's one thing I hate and that's a mother fucking cockblock (x3)

(Outro)
Fuck you you fucking hatin bitches You cockblockin motherfuckers
I hate you bitches
Haters
