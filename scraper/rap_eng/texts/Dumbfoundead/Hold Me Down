[Pre Hook: Dumbfoundead]
Only top shelf liquor allowed at my grave
Cover charge at my funeral, pimps deserve to get paid
Got a bad yellow bitch with tears rolling down her face
I ain't put her in the will but she will hold me down when I fade

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
Who gone hold me down? [x3]
When I'm six feet underground
Who gone hold me down? [x3]
Til I'm six feet underground

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Body bag in a Cadillac black widow bitch
That I went to hell and back with
If she with me from the Avenues
I take her from the backstreets all the way to Saks Fifth
We were fucking on the money on the mattress
Stick it through her when I'm fucking them ratchets
Had you hot like a matchhead, yeah
But the fact is you the only one I trust to the casket
Yeah you're that bitch
Never lived a would've, should've
Did it, done it, out the gutter
Obituary's on the front of
All the papers, crying lovers
Getting head like stone cold stunner
Getting bread like empanada
Fuck up commas, fuck up grammar
Old boy John, I tucked the hammer

[Pre Hook: Dumbfoundead]
Only top shelf liquor allowed at my grave
Cover charge at my funeral, pimps deserve to get paid
Got a bad yellow bitch with tears rolling down her face
I ain't put her in the will but she will hold me down when I fade

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
Who gone hold me down? [x3]
When I'm six feet underground
Who gone hold me down? [x3]
Till I'm six feet underground

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Ashes ashes dust to dust
Spread my ashes on the 101 South
Smoking that loud out the moonroof
Ignorant with the whole crew all this during rush hour
Let us see them titties one time
My legacy will live a long time
Hennessy from seventeen thou
Trying to take a light pink limousine to heaven with a hot young Ebony dime piece
Lord forgive me I'm the Oprah Winfrey
Gave my all and took my hometown with me
Blood, sweat, tears, and both my kidneys
The eleventh letter til death come get me
Mama said kill them with kindness
Daddy said kill for them diamonds
I been murdering ever since putting on everything
Won't die 'till I reach prime, promise

Who gone hold me down? [x3]
When I'm six feet underground
Who gone hold me down? [x3]
