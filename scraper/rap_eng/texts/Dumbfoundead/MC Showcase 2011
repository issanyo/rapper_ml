[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Yo, I remember when cyphers were off the dome
It happened on street corners, not recorded at your home
It's something I don't condone, I hope that I'm not alone
I'm doing this for the trolls that are commenting down below
Let's pick it up from D-Pryde
Listen up, it's "me" time
Arizonas, hit Coronas, buzzing like a beehive
Don't even need to be high to blow it up, I'm Jihad
This is all free, no tickets out the kiosk (Bee-yotch!)
A free speech inner city griot
Ladies on the dick 'cause I'm rocking a Magnum P.I
Everybody, be honest. You thought I wouldn't be on it?
I'm killing, now you're feeling it and clapping like a sea otter
The legendary freestyler, I say my name three times
Appear like the Candyman and beat your little pinatas
They call me E. Honda, I got a strong pimp hand
Your girl, she's a big fan and hanging off my kickstand
I'm obviously a product of wasted youth
And to the total opposite of everything safe to do
Used to have an ankle bracelet that beeped when I left the room
Not really a role-model, I'm here to corrupt the youth
Middle fingers lifted proud, five-finger discounts
Kick, spit, piss, flick cigs where the pigs lounge
Swigging a 5th of any liquor that is shit brown
Drinking early like the locals at the hick-town
Shout-out to Dale Firebird for the moonshine
Flow so sick, people saying gesundheit
Always got bars around me, feels like I'm doing time
You and I are like comparing boxing to muay thai

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
Fans lining up, trying to smoke me out, telling me they got a fat blunt rolled
If they see us in the venue, they might kick us out, but holler at me after the show, ho

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Yo, half Frankenstein, other half Genghis Khan
The type of style that most people can't describe
Young'uns coming up, telling me that I'm past my prime
I was better than most folks when my ass was five
Huh, yeah, you too weak for this
Might as well quit and turn in your two-weeks notice
I make quotables, you barely meet quotas
K-Town hold my city on each shoulder
Local celebrity, international pimp
Never get hotel room, just crash at her crib
No rent-a-car, she my private taxi and shit
Does whatever I want her to, never ask for a tip
Huh, drank toasted, smoking dank posted
Hoes get spanked while we bumpin' that Frank Ocean
West-Coasting, dubs in the air
Freestyles over here, free hugs over there
