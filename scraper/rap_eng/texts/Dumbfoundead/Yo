Yo I'm gettin' more hits then porn flicks on the internet
This foreign kid has your bitch as a Giggapet
Liquor dinner, should get my innards and liver checked
Fuck your facebook, flicker pictures and twitter rep
You corny fuckers your father's Orville Redenbacher
Im shitin' on you after a dozen Jalapeno poppers
They ask me questions like do you enjoy eating dogs?
The answer's yes I posted pictures on a vegan blog
Im meeting god when I turn 27
Drink a 2/11 beverage and burn with the legends
Chorus's with Morrison, sessions with cobain
Start dancin' with all the dead extra's on soul train
I bet you want me to hold a guitar
Cover cute songs from bruno mars like all them Asian kids do
But im doin bodily harm and spittin bars about hardships
And the crazy shit that I been through

[Hook]

Yall really need to step up your shit yo
Get your bars up get off eachothers dick yo
I ain't hatin' go ahead brother get yo's
But stop talkin' let me really hear you spit yo
Grown men putting on a little kid show
All that wack shit is making me feel sick yo
Go my drink in my cup and my spliff rolled
All my real cats let me hear you say a big YO

[Second verse]

Catch me laughing in the battle field
Your ass slipin' on half bitten banana peels
Chicken sandwich's famished off of the value meal
I still make the man of steel look bad for ?deals?
Zoe is evil got a pack of needles, scratch and kill
Cuts like a jack-o-lantern on a patcher field
Smash your bitch and give her some mornin' after pills
Won't be havin' that daddy daddy I want a happy meal
Any rapper will get molliwhoped call the cops
----sorry don't know this line-----
Karate chops to bring new meaning to collar poped
Watch me holla at baby mommas in ghetto dolla shops
Im as west as impala's with hydrolic shocks
Ask for directions I'mma point you to the chronic spot
Jefferey Dommer spitin' bars hot as sauna rocks
If you got a problem then hit me in the comment box

[Hook]

Yall really need to step up your shit yo
Get your bars up get off eachothers dick yo
I ain't hatin' go ahead brother get yo's
But stop talkin' let me really hear you spit yo
Grown men putting on a little kid show
All that wack shit is making me feel sick yo
Go my drink in my cup and my spliff rolled
All my real cats let me hear you say a big YO
YO YO YO YO YO, YO YO YO YO YO YO YO YO
PEACE
