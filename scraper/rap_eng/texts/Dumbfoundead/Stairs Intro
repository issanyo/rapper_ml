Went from the corner store to family cornerstone
My father was a rolling stone
Mother mi corazon
Chino off of Normandy, no need for Rosetta Stone
Chicanos took me in and treated me as if I was their own
Young legend in the shadows of K-Town
Under-appreciated but my greatness was space bound
I held it down for my people at a time
When my people looked at me like I was out my damn mind
I forgive 'em, all the lows provided me higher living
Now the haters on the low, they be asking me how I'm living
Things sure have changed since '04
Now I'm traveling to places that I'd seen in brochures
Yellow kid with the beanie in the summer
But never hot-headed, kept it cool, I'm a lover
Smooth Asian brother, mustache looking butter
Can't walk a block without a fan saying "What up?"
What up player, I'm living like a mayor
Trying to hijack the airwaves, call me Con Air
Never took a shortcut man, I took the long stairs
Now blonde haired chicks on my dick like John Mayer
Used to bum rides off the homies' Hyundai
Hit the lab with a big dream and a junk drive
Now I got a whip, looking like I stunt drive
Smoking blunts, high, middle fingers to the one time
Yeah you see me on the web like Charlotte
Racking up the views not knowing what I started
Numbers look retarded like mainstream artists
Your boy did it all on his own while uncharted
People still asking, “Brother, are we there yet?”
We ain't even close cause my momma in a hairnet
If you're feeling me then put one in the air vent
Longer that I walk up, the higher that these stairs get
