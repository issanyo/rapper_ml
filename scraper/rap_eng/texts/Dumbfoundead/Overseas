Verse 1:
Prepare the work visas, I'm going to Seoul Korea
Cause my name about to blow out there, like the ocarina
Don’t know how long I'mma last, cause smoking dopes illegal
Unless you got the cash and you know the right people
Yea the motherland show love as soon as I land
Pouring me a shot of Soju, using two hands
Every time I'm out there I make new fans
They don’t understand my punchlines but still say "Damn!"
Pack shows easily, mad hoes grab hold eagerly
Believe it brotha I'm that known
Feel I’ve arrived at home
Drinks, food and girls they provide that holmes
I've got friends in high places, yes they're quite famous
VIP treatment when they see who I came with
The fans go crazy when I rap in my native tongue
Seoul Korea here I come

Hook:
I’m going overseas
Come fly with me I’ll give you all
I’m going overseas
Come fly with me I’ll give you all
I’ll give you all

My currency is colorful, different from them other fools
Handed 'em a stack of bills and they ain't know what to do
Around here the air different
Went from an ordinary tourist to the mayor pimpin'
Women blowing air kisses
Interviews and magazine photo shoots lined up
Grind all the time, like a 9 to 5 kind of
All the clubs open 'til the morning when the rooster crow
Step out of the venue you can see both of my pupils close
Just like my brotha JK, I'm a tiger
Every time I visit here I leave a bit wiser
Crowds a bit liver, screams and lit lighters
Hands up the whole time they never get tired
All over the foreign blogs, land of the morning calm
Welcome me with open arms

Hook:
I’m going overseas
Come fly with me I’ll give you all
I’m going overseas
Come fly with me I’ll give you all
I’ll give you all

Bridge:
Summer of ’09
Oh, you were so fine
It was are first time
I didn’t want to go back home but I knew I’d be back fa sho
I’m here for the winter
The end of December
We’re back together
For a year I left you all alone, its crazy how time has flown

Verse 3:
Mad women hollerin' like I'mma take 'em to the States
But I ain't lookin' for a wife, I just came out to play
I've got homies from LA who flew here to visit cousins
But they never left and settled here cause they fuckin' love it
Can't blame 'em, there's a lot of haters in the U.S
A lot of major problems and anger in the U.S
Yes this country’s got a hold of me
Right where I'm supposed to be

Hook:
I’m going overseas
Come fly with me I’ll give you all
I’m going overseas
Come fly with me I’ll give you all
I’ll give you all
