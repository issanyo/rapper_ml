[Chorus]
My real mama fresh off the boat (boat)
My lil' mama fresh off the yacht (yacht)
Lil' foreign boy in America (ooh)
Look at how far we got (yeah)
My old head said I got the juice (jui')
Lil' homie said I got the sauce (sauce)
Lil' foreign boy in America (ooh)
I'ma give 'em every last drop
Like I’m drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
All my blood, tears, and sweat, yuh (wooh)
Drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
Diamonds on my neck, yuh (sauce)
(I got the juice!)
Drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
The money make her wet, yuh (wooh, sauce)
Drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
Hold it down to the death, yuh

[Verse 1]
Yeah, how they gonna hate tho
Mama turned yellow trash into straight gold
Helipad on the penthouse condo
Family overseas filling up their Venmo (brr)
Riding in my foreign whip going turbo (skrt)
Wind blowing on the Killa Cam furcoat
Now all we got us is first world problems
Spilling merlot on a third world island, hmm
I secured the bag, like going through immigration
All I talk is cash, yeah money my native language
It's funny how they say I'm a voice of a generation
When all I really wanted was pussy and being famous
I’m just bein' brutally honest
Yeah I was stupid and childish
But grew up and got it
I said I would do it, came through on the promise

[Chorus]
My real mama fresh off the boat (boat)
My lil' mama fresh off the yacht (yacht)
Lil' foreign boy in America (ooh)
Look at how far we got (yeah)
My old head said I got the juice (jui')
Lil' homie said I got the sauce (sauce)
Lil' foreign boy in America (ooh)
I'ma give 'em every last drop
Like I’m drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
All my blood, tears, and sweat, yuh (wooh)
Drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
Diamonds on my neck, yuh (sauce)
(I got the juice!)
Drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
The money make her wet, yuh (wooh, sauce)
Drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
Hold it down to the death, yuh

[Verse 2]
I’m hydrated, eyes dilated
Yelling "I made it, mama I made it"
Feeling like a rock star, Iron Maiden
You know I'm winnin' with an all-star group of blonde women
(I got the juice!)
My goods are imported 'cause I can afford it
They smokin', they snortin', they sippin', they horny
Out in Koreatown, fo' in the morning
With domies and 노래방, I got the water
Drippin'
You ain't even gotta look me up on the wiki
I don't save money, I am not Lil Dicky
Rounds on me if she down and she pretty
Now we gettin trippy, yippee
Got an Uber full of mixed chicks, I'm a misfit
Driving down Route 66, gettin' lit lit
Feelin' like it's fiction, yeah it's been a mission
Put the work in with the wrist, now it's drippin'

[Chorus]
My real mama fresh off the boat (boat)
My lil' mama fresh off the yacht (yacht)
Lil' foreign boy in America (ooh)
Look at how far we got (yeah)
My old head said I got the juice (jui')
Lil' homie said I got the sauce (sauce)
Lil' foreign boy in America (ooh)
I'ma give 'em every last drop
Like I’m drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
All my blood, tears, and sweat, yuh
(I got the juice!)
Drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’ (wooh)
Diamonds on my neck, yuh (sauce)
(I got the juice!)
Drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
The money make her wet, yuh (wooh, sauce)
Drippin', drippin’, drippin’, drippin’
Hold it down to the death, yuh
