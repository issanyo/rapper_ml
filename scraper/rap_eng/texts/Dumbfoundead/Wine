[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]

Met a little PYT
But just to play it safe I had to see ID
She 19, all up on my D-I-C
Old enough to hit it, too young to be my queen
A ghetto princess, I met her on 6th and Alvarado
She fucking up in junior college drinking 40 bottles
Already got a bunch of dumbass tats that she'll regret
Butterflies, Chinese letters and the name of her ex
Silver tongue ring, she such a cute thing
Couldn't name a single member of the Wu-Tang
Thinking she's so mature, she got her own car
She's so independent, give her a gold star
Calling me condescending, I'm the one who taught her that word
Dumb as a bird, lucky that she got a bottom on her
It must have been straight out of high school when she turned bad
Doing things that make me wonder "Where'd she learn that?"

[Hook: Breezy Lovejoy]
Two worlds collide
Met her on Franklin and Vine
You gon' get me caught up
Girl you're too young to drink the wine
It's not bad but it's not right
She wanna run me all night
Damn it I'm caught up
Girl you're too young to drink the wine

[Verse 2: Wax]

She got the body of a woman, brain of a girl
Not yet schooled in the ways of the world
Looking fine and lying at the front door
It's only the second time she's been to a club before
She got her ID from her older and uglier sister
Hands it to the bouncer hoping that he won't study the picture
She's lucky he missed her
Then she rolls inside with her chin up
Ready to get lit up
Pretending that she's not a teen
But a shot of Beam turn's her straight from Prom queen to drama queen
In the corner, crying about her ex dude
I know the game, I'm already on my next move
I'll hit it once, but there ain't gon' be no dinner dating
When 9/11 happened, she was finger painting
I ain't hating, I'm just not relating
Man I hope she wasn't ovulating
Damn

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]

Took the shorty to a function, my homies were loving her
But all the other girls were bugging like "Look at her"
("Ew look at that skirt, what a little slut")
I could tell that they just jealous cause she got a bigger butt
She way cooler and always down to party 'til the AM
While all the girls my age, they now want to stay in
Complaining how good men are hard to find
But my girl, the only thing on mind is finding
A party, and bullshit
And party, and bullshit
And party, and bullshit
I love the way that you ain't giving a fuck

[Hook]
