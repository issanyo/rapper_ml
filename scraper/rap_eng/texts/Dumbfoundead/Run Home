[Verse 1:]

Damn girl where your life go, ain't seen you since the snot nose
Saw you in that penthouse, I ain't talking top floor
Confused about your baby daddy showing up on talk shows
Now you're dropping low to cop diapers up at Costco

Where the vision at, where the hell that spark go
Turned into a bar fly, became another bar code
You ain't a d-cup, that ain't your real hair
Under all that makeup, I know that you're still there

That take charge, race car driven girl I knew
All them crazy love songs I wrote, I refer to you
I would spend hours thinking 'bout the right words to use
Now I've got fans around the world that have heard of you

Bet you ain't even know your name's famous huh
I've mentioned you in interviews like a shameless plug
Let the rain pour and the mascara run
Home is where the heart is, run away to where you're from

[Hook]

Run, run home girl
You never knew the world could be so cold
Home is where the heart is, back to where we started
Girl where we had more highs than lows

Yeah, I said run, run home girl
I never ever wanna see you alone
You been gone a while now, You've been trying to wile out
Girl now it's time for you to come on home

[Verse 2:]

I said I'd take care of you, since we were in grade school
Written in that valentines card that I gave you
You were misbehaved, go to raves, always date dudes
I was paying dues, laying vocals down on pro tools

We went on different paths, while you were getting trashed
I was getting cash, kicking ass on a different class
Now I'm trying to take you places that you ain't seen
The type of places that you've only seen in daydreams

Yeah that travel life, camera lights, fancy rides
VIP treatment, we ain't ever got to stand in line
I know this ain't the type of lifestyle you're used to
But I swear you've done this shit before, it suits you

We all make mistakes, especially when you're very young
That step towards being grown is a scary one
It's just you and me don't worry about anyone
Home is where the heart is
Run away to where you're from

[Hook]
