[Intro: Thane Maynard]
He has got inside, he has climbed through the fence, and has fallen about 3 meters into the enclosure. Debate now turning to whether or not the zoo authorities did the right thing, in ordering a gorilla to be shot, rather than tranquilized
I don't question why they felt it was a life threatening situation

[Hook]
They tryna' take me out like Harambe
I take a tranquilizer on a Monday
Why the real ones we lost get listed in the back
While the frontin' motherfuckers get the front page
The world is a zoo, you've seen the news
You've seen them shoot at the youth
The world is a zoo
I'll see you pigs at the barbecue
God bless the red, white and blue
(Harambe)

[Verse 1]
Paranoia just to hit the corner store
To get a cherry cola and a bag of chips, what a bitch
They got neighborhood watch for the gangs and the cops
I ain't talking bad standards, feel the burner on your neck
Won't give you an attorney over gurney to get checked
We'll be lucky just to get to thirty, die an early death
They might give me twenty-five to life for murderin' my set
Broke boys everywhere like the government in debt
Welcome to the jungle with more guns than roses
Keep from going under, now don't push me over
Hold my composure, four whiskey sodas
I need that Irish, no luck with clovers

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Who the fuck the plug where the medicine man stay
It's only two o'clock and already a bad day
Need two bad bitches delivered to man cave
One man's soul is something you can't take
Call a repo man, I'm a people man
But the world don't treat you like an equal man
I don't care if you CEO or pizza man
We just want our peace of mind and own a piece of land
(Just preach)
I don't want my future daughter asking 'why they do them like that?' (Why the do that daddy?)
The fuck im'ma say? Well baby, the world gone mad
Losing all the heroes like the Marlboro man
Smoked all the leaves off the olive branch
How you stop a killer when the killer in the mirror
And gorilla Like someone come and get ya lil' man's
Harambe
