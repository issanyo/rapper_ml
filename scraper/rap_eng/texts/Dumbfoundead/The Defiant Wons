I toured in the states in a mini rv
While big out in asia like n.e.r.d
Did it by myself, i was only 19
Didn't wait on the radar of jimmy iovine

Be quiet, y’all thought i’d never get on
Ima triumph, homie thats a insult dog
Im high up, ain't no service at the top
Gotta drive up, swervin muholland through the fog

Bitches, never gave time at the function
Bitches, now they say hi at runyon
Which is why i keep my mind on my money
Tens and the fifty,s , fives and the twenties

Why call me dummy, IQ a buck twenty
24 Karats i feel like bugs bunny
All these f**kboys trynna play chum chummy
They call me homie when they really never knew me

Feel like its the Truman Show, tell me who’s been
My life is a movie the opening scene is right now

Tennis shoes on the wire
Just a regular guy but they say I’m the man
Set a palm trees on fire
Because
They said i couldn’t get high as i already am

Im so defiant
Yea I’m so defiant
Might start a riot
Step over the giants

I get as high as mariah
Get as high as mariah

I’m so high so high got a dap from an angel
Surfing on crowds from the clouds where i dangle
With all my disciple’s supper’s on the table
We feasting we beasting whole squad on the payroll
When i die bury me with a smile and my integrity
I dont f**k around when it come to this
Motivate the fam and inspire kids
Went from youtube covers to being on magazine covers
So she could see her sunshine i bought some shades
For my mother yah yah yah
Been a killer in the game ten years row
All my chickie’s bodies bang bang Marilyn monroe
Dumb and jay park poppin’ getting lit in this hoe
Viewing ass muhf**ka man i’ve been in the show
I don’t think u understand that i ain't playing
Unlike these rappers i mean everything i’m saying
Nothing lose and i got everything to gain
Look at me boutta change the world
Muhf**ka watch me change the world

Tennis shoes on the wire
Just a regular guy but they say I’m the man
Set a palm trees on fire
Because
They said i couldn’t get high as i already am

Im so defiant
Yea I’m so defiant
Might start a riot
Step over the giants

I get as high as mariah
Get as high as mariah

Its so ironic
How’d i get so iconic
If i told you my secret
You say i was a liar
She said i was her bias
I said ooh your’e so bias
I can be your supplier
If you wanna get high

Tennis shoes on the wire
Just a regular guy but they say I’m the man
Set a palm trees on fire
Because
They said i couldn’t get high as i already am

Im so defiant
Yea I’m so defiant
Might start a riot
Step over the giants

I get as high as mariah
Get as high as mariah
