[Verse 1]

When I was 15 they said "Get on that real shit
Stop rapping 'bout the moon, there ain't no room for that Neil shit"
They just assume that I'm in my room
With posters of galaxies and that's why I'm closer to fantasy
Nah brotha
It wasn't spaceships I heard
Only screams of her
Her meaning my mother, father was slurring his words
So when I wrote words like 'space'
It's metaphor for safe, and stars are better places
Get it?
Both of my parents didn't
The language barriers kept them from knowing anything about me
All the things that I'd tell them would sound American
I sell them, so why would they ever doubt me?
I will continue my journey until my late teens
An out of body experience, I would take 3
Sniffing, smoking, having myself a space dream
Feeling alone, can't connect to all of these earthlings

[Hook]

What's a man without his word
If we ain't got a bond then what's it all worth
I can tell you the truth, but damn, the truth hurts
As long as I'm living, I'mma give you my word
Word

If I said I meant it and I'mma do it, do it [x3]
What's a man without his word

[Verse 2]

When I turned 20 they told me "Get on that hard shit
We don't want to hear about all of that broken heart shit"
Money over bitches is all I heard
Heard falling in love was only for herbs herbs
So I spit about stealing your girl and how she want me
Way I'm beating that pussy up, sounding hella thirsty
Then it occurred that it ain't her that I wanted
But the validation of all of my G's on the curb
All that shit that I rapped about
My dad, he had acted out
The secret women that prevented us from a happy house
As long as it was catchy I turned it into a chorus
Pretending that my momma and sister would just ignore it
So I yelled (bitches, bitches, bitches)
Words becoming (contradictions, 'dictions, 'dictions)
Now I can't label it a fiction
It's sounding too convincing
It is what it is when you say it with conviction

[Hook]

What's a man without his word
If we ain't got a bond then what's it all worth
I can tell you the truth, but damn, the truth hurts
As long as I'm living, I'mma give you my word
Word

If I said I meant it and I'mma do it, do it [x3]
What's a man without his word

[Verse 3]

They find real life boring
Fantasy is corny
Afraid of exploring, need someone to do it for 'em
Fake shit do sound real when it's recorded
So that fake shit sells to this country every morning
And the real shit fails and gets put inside for storage
But the real will prevail when the country's in mourning
Word
When you don't mean it you say 'Word'
Word
All it's become is just a four letter word

[Hook]

What's a man without his word
If we ain't got a bond then what's it all worth
I can tell you the truth, but damn, the truth hurts
As long as I'm living, I'mma give you my word
Word

What's a man without his word
