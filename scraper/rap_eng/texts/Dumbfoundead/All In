[Hook: CA$HPASSION]
Life of the party soon as I walk in
All these thotties on me they know I'm balling
I can get you on if you really want it
Double all my profits I'm going all in
Bitch I'm all in, all in
Going all in, I'm all in
Bitch I'm all in, going all in

[Verse 1: CA$HPASSION]
Came in I'm flexin' giuseppe I'm steppin' you know when I walk up in the building
Your girl need attention, I'm never stressin' these other suckers all up in they feelings
They don't see the ceiling, she only want the realest
I'm bout my money and I'm bout the cheque, you know that I'ma get it I'ma spend it
Grindin' and grindin' for years
I've been making these verses superior
They never wanted to hear
Now I got bad bitches all up my ear
I don't want 'em I just want a trophy
No cuffing, I ain’t no parolee
They wanna kick it, I'm their favorite goalie kid
You just wanna get a chance to know me

[Hook: CA$HPASSION]
Life of the party soon as I walk in
All these thotties on me they know I'm balling
I can get you on if you really want it
Double all my profits I'm going all in

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
My life a movie by Francis Coppola
We do it over with no chance to sober up
I wrote the book on turning up with squad
Grew up like a child star
Wallet like Macaulay Culkin, youngin at the parties
Loyal like Johnnie Cochran to get out of my charges
Fucking with designer drugs I'm freshing up Versace
Drowning in the pussy while you looking like mojave
[?] out, [?] out
Feeling like I'm Shaggy I can't turn a woman down
It wasn't me
Simmer down, simmer down
All the homies told me I should really slow it down
Unapologetic, made it over 27
So I guess I'm in the clear right here
Even with the medics, saw that stairway up to heaven
Imma say that wasn't ill life, real life

[Hook: CA$HPASSION]
Life of the party soon as I walk in
All these thotties on me they know I'm balling
I can get you on if you really want it
Double all my profits I'm going all in
