[Intro: Dumbfoundead]
(Superman superman fly away)
Yo what's up yall? (Hey hey)
Hey Timmy, what's popping, man? (Hey)
(Superman superman fly away)
Hey Ralph, how you doing? (Hey)
What are you guys doing over here?
Just chilling playing freeze tag fool
Oh word word word
(Superman superman fly away)
Hey, but who's that new kid right there?
Oh that kid? That kid's trouble, dog
Trouble?
That kid's trouble, fool
(Superman superman fly away)
What do you mean trouble, man?

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Yo as dumb da de dumb as a young kid
Put bubble gum in the hair of my young sis' (I hate you!)
Ate glue scrum-diddly-umptious
My tongue was a gun clip
Filthy with nothing to scrub with
Guilty was always the verdict
Five finger discounts no need to purchase (yoink)
Knock knock! Who's there? The police
Don't mean to burden you missus
Fist fights burgundy lips and sniffing too many pixie sticks
The neighbours witnessed and called me the 666
He's evil! Chino cochino
Holler at a [?] and they give her the old heave ho
Ice cream, [?] flame and hot cheetos
Cheese on my fritos, drinking jarritos
Dumbfoundead straight from the body-oh
All up in your [?]-oh
Sing along just like a kara-oke

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
Here comes trouble!
(I heard he was born at an AA meeting)
Have a little fun with dumb
Here comes trouble!
(I heard he can burn DVDs with his mind. Liar!)
Have a little fun with dumb
Here comes trouble!
(I heard he really does eat cats)
Have a little fun with dumb
Here comes trouble!
(Watch out, watch out now)

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Posted at the 7-11 at age 11
Asking grown folks to get me a 211
A beverage you can only get if you're 21
So I couldn't get it
But I connected with a mexican dude
Who said he'd get it
If I get him a pack of cigarettes
So I let him
After I got it I headed down to Venice
To meet up another menace
Who later became my brother
Me and trouble are just magnetic (bzzz)
We are embedded, street credded
And headed in a direction of
Questioning detectives yelling out (spread 'em!)
I am the least timid asian American in the present
A bit aggressive, [?] stresses a kid in messy denims
Confessing all my sins to the reverand
But there is no heaven
Only the city with revving engines
And the smell of resin my brethren
I'm just shedding some light onto my adolescence
If you haven't already guessed it
I have me some heavy weapons
All of you better exit
When you're hearing this very sentence

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
Here comes trouble!
(I heard he battled himself on grind time and got served)
Have a little fun with dumb
Here comes trouble!
(I've seen him make a cop cry, I swear to god)
Have a little fun with dumb
Here comes trouble!
(He took all my [?] tickets last week)
Have a little fun with dumb
Here comes trouble!
(Watch out, watch out now)

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]
Project Blowed, Swim Team that be my crew
Relaxing in pools we be acting the fool
Sat holding a blunt and [?] with booze
Dumbfoundead D-Styles scratching for you
If you're whack then you rappers get booed
Break into your green room jack your basket of fruit
(What is that gonna prove?)
I just like being an asshole to fools
Especially ones that are more fashionable
I disregard all security guards, law enforcement
Anyone who appears as a narc' (narc'!)
I'll turn the lights off if you're scared of the dark
And turn your mic off while you're sharing your art
I'll slash all your tyres and the spare in your car
Turn up to your party uninvited (uuuh, where do I park?)
Go find your favorite rapper and then tear him apart
Trouble just got here and I don't care to depart

[Hook: Dumbfoundead]
Here comes trouble!
(I heard he wasn't even asian he's just always high)
Have a little fun with dumb
Here comes trouble!
(I heard he hasn't slept in a year. Whoa, what the fuck??)
Have a little fun with dumb
Here comes trouble!
(I heard he's fireproof. You liar you!)
Have a little fun with dumb
Here comes trouble!
(Watch out, watch out now)
