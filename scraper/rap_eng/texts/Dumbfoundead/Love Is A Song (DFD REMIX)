I guess im trippin for me to ask you to take me back
I'm just bitter cause I won't ever get a taste of that, again
3am can't delete your number out my phone
Sendin you messages hopin that you are down to bone

I bet you find it pathetic that I be still at it
Had me some one hit wonders babygirl you're illmatic
A real classic, im such a bastard, chasin after a bunch of plastics
Over passion, now you mad

But no hard feelins, im not your arch villain
You got me writin more love songs than john lennon
Theres nothing wrong with it, you love every minute of it
I'm pennin every sentence hopin you feel pity from it

You say I'm so sweet but only on beats
Cause in person I always seem say the wrong things
He's such an asshole, look at him rap though
A sweet apology with a Jason mraz flow

Im just playin' you used to find me funny though
Before you saw me use same jokes on other hoes
Girl you were so pissed you tried to let my mother know
I fucked it up with my credibility runnin low

And I ain't sayin im a changed man
But I'm switchin from fake bitches to namebrands
You got this player forgettin about his gameplan
I got your name stuck in my head like rainman

You never know what you have till you lose it
And all the other girls that I smash are illusions
Late night ass, theres really nothing to it
You got them killer moves, and they don't know the way you do it, was a student

To your body and behaviours
Studied it like my major
That pussy is cocaine, cuttin it like a razor
Say the word, and Im back in
Gave me more shots then a mac 10, so lets shoot again
Not you again, is the look you give me now
Im writin this like I ain't got a chick with me now
I'll probably write her one too when I let her down
And best believe the next song will have a better sound

How many tracks till I settle down
Put it on wax, let it spin around

Whats wrong with writing another love song
Cause all you got is love songs when the loves gone
