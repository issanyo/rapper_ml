[Bambu]
Y'all must've caught a bad case of dementia
Cause all of this talk about the best in L.A., I ain't mentioned?
I've been over destined, endurance beyond the fake
And signed a 360 industry deal, rookie mistake
And I did it rapping about politics
Calling out hoes that's counterfeit
A brown out
And all of my people are feeling powerless
Sustainable rap career, can't deny the amount of word
The O's saying, "Don't join the rodeo if you don't like the dirt."
I say shitting off power lines like pigeons but keep it militant
And one call turn the UHaul, your car's surrounded by immigrants

[Dumbfoundead]
I've been a threat before the Internet was invented
I should win a pennant for doing this all independent
Middle fingers to the critics, I want a little credit
I made a lot of you little boys call me Jimmy Cricket
Shit be with it and vibe to it, get high to it
We getting raw while y'all shit is just raw sewage
Body the beat it's a rap/wrap
Erykah Badu'd it
1992 riot music set fire to it

[Bambu]
Roasting pigs openly, pare yung Mang Tomas
Don't get it, don't sweat it, my Filipino's know what's up
And I run amok when I rap from back when biting wasn't cutting it
These fools follow trends like there's a hash tag in front of it
Slumming it for a dollar but borrow that gang slang
I've been out by where you came, they're like "eh" when I say your name
Laying lames down in a manner where rappers ain't even factors
I'm after the corporations who owns the slaves and his masters
I've had it

[Drunken Tiger JK]
I'm getting sick of these rappers I need an antidote
When people seeing Tiger they running like they was antelope
I'm just an animal
Diss me I dismantle you
Now let me treat a language to make you more understandable

[Bambu]
Anyone who got an issue with the line up
You should go find a Go-Fuck-Yourself Club and sign up
Hey those are really tall palms trees, climb up
Kick an ill 16 (You feel me ma?) and die brah
Kasi pag tumama si DePistola is grabe
Runnin' through the barangay "Ay! Binugbog si kuya, ate!"
You better call for help I blame the rapper he was copying
Tough talk turn to mumble and then turn down the volume

[Ruby Ibarra]
Kung hindi pa kilala ang pangalan na Ibarra
Ang reyna ng mga bara'ng, kinain ng mga letra
Isang musikera, pero teka muna, ako mismo ay may bala sa bibig ko para lang sa lirisismo, ya
I make the tunes I can level [?]

​Pare, pare kase ganito lamang yan ka simple
Mga salitang madulas na parang basang kili-kili, aking pinapalabas parang kang nanuod ng sine
Ako lang ang tagalog 'di na kailangan mamile
Ako nga pala si Aristotle ng Maynila, aking dila'y parang pumapagaspas na bandila
Tagapagbigay ng ilaw sa dilim parang kandila
