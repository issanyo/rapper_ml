[Hook:Mike B]
I know you heard 'bout me
You see me doing my thing
I be doing my, thing
When I'm up on scene
Pull up, pop out, show up, show out

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Still Goin'
Your girl moanin'
I GTA the pussy that shit stolen
She be tripping how I got so much stamina
Got no more room on the corner-a
Why you mad? Why your boyfriend mad?
He don't bang, man he just wear plaid
He be knocking out way too early that's why you crash at my pad
You ain't sleeping over though
Ain't no sleeping going on
If you got a favorite Pandora station throw it on
Bet you look even better when naked go and show it off
I got you screaming out more yeses than a know-it-all
Yeah don't stop, get it get it
That's real
Don't stop go and hit it
I will
I'm goin' do it, I'm goin' do it
You ain't hit the pussy right homie you blew it

[Altered Hook:Mike B]
I know you heard 'bout me
You see me doing my thing

When I'm up on scene
Pull up, pop out, show up, show out
Hey, I'm still goin'
You watch your girl around me, man I try to tell her
Hey, I'm still goin'
My whole team around me and you know that we


[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Your bitch say you finish too soon
Tell that bitch get in my room
I hit it one time, now she want two
That's why she ain't fucking with you
We still goin' I give her more
Keep on working on your form, you can't ignore
My dick should be represented, by william morris
Issue in a couple pendants, and teach a course
I see a hundred jealous motherfuckers everyday
They talking Mazarati seen 'em driving Chevrolets
And when you talking all that money what you make from it?
Say you represent my hood but only take from it
Don't get it twisted
I don't bang that's the difference, I don't even make a sound
She just love it when I shoot a couple rounds
Go ahead and do them couple things I'm just tryna fuck
Give her boot camp dick, watch the way I duck her down word to buckshot
Why the fuck not?
Tell me why the fuck not?
Can't an asian brother get cocky for a minute?
I be talking what I'm living so I talk a lot of women
Shut the fuck up for a second, are you finished?
Yeah we Still Goin'

[Hook B:Dumbfoundead]
Your bitch say you finish too soon
Tell that bitch get in my room
I hit it one time, now she want two
That's why she ain't fucking with you
