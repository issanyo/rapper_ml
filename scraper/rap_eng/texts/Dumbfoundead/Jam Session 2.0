[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
A kid at the pawn shop just bought his first drum machine
From the slums, but them buttons will take him to another kingdom
A woman humming in a kitchen in brazil, while 50 tenants listen by
Sticking their heads outside the window sill, this shit is real hear
The sounds across the land, no name brands, woman and man jam on pots
And pans
A musician with lost dreams, sitting on concrete
Playing His heart out on missing guitar strings
Street performers for a Quarter put on the show of their life
An emcee gets put on the spot Rocks it and tears up the mic
The human instrument, reaching Continents in long distances, no need for sophisticated systems for us To listen in
Countries at war, expressing hate through there Aggression
While two musicians on each side are having a jam session
Whether both em know it or not, they are collaborating
You never know
Which way your music is navigating

[Chorus: Esna]
Sing your heart out let your soul be heard
Move to the rhythm to the groove of the drum beats
Chill to the lines disappear to the moment
Fly away persuade all the madness
Just bounce just sway just listen

[Verse 2: Herbal T]
La música es un sonido supersónico
Y es por eso que no creo lo que leo en el periódico
Presenta un mundo dividido y tóxico
Pero ahora por los cables fiberópticos
Yo me comunico, así el mundo se pone chico
Si no me entiendes yo te lo explico
Whether you in the Bronx and you like to spit bars and rock clubs
Or Mumbai playin sitars and tablas
The music is a way we escape, heal and grow
And you ain't gotta speak the language if you wanna feel the flow
Olha só rapaz, a gente vai a gente vem
Mas o ritmo é coisa todo mundo sempre tem
Tudo bem, faço música com colaboradores globais
Utilizando piano voces tambores e mais
Es un laso que nos une hasta el infinito
The rhythms in us it travels wherever we go

[Chorus: Esna]
Just let the music take you let your mind take you
Way to find a way to need a way to a brighter day
Don't let it stop in you don't let it die in you
Breath just breath
Just fly away persuade all the madness
Just bounce just sway just listen

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]
Across the seas I hear piano keys playin, translating languages
Through the rhythms in beats bangin, a universal exchange, of personal
Pains and joys, it started with a verse, each person just came and
Joined in, some are complete strangers, some only teenagers, all of us
Creators, , we are the dreammakers, internationally transmittin
Through bandwidth, passin this bands passion so the masses can jam
With us, all are invited to play, none are required to pay, let the
Virus spread, inspire heads, go pirate away, this is that free music
For people who need music, just listen and breathe to it, I hope that
You feel movement, different souls around globe, connected through
Sound makin, they set the foundation now we take it to groundbreakin
Everybody played there part and now we have one song, and this is how
An unheard voice becomes strong

[Chorus: Esna]
Sing your heart out let your soul be heard
Move to the rhythm to the groove of the drum beats
Chill to the lines disappear to the moment
Fly away persuade all the madness
Just bounce just sway just listen
