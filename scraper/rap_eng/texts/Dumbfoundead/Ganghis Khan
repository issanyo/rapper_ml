[Verse 1]
Genghis Khan, roll with a angry mob that's firin shots
That are Hollywood prop
We smoking up pot from the guy with the locks in the medicine shop
If you wanna know about my whereabouts party at the warehouse
Filming up a ratchet chick flick, Paramount
Fahrenheit ‘51 burnin up paper, whole ship down like a cruise ship anchor
Pissed off, let the pistol blow
Diddy in the club let the Cristal flow
Slow motherfuckers like escargot
Sleepin' on me must be narco
-Leptic yo exes are sending me titty flix to the text like XXX
If I give you D, would you give me weed and the keys to your whip, she like “Yes Yes Yes”
Woodstock everyday man I can't stop
Got drugs in my Chucks and my HUF socks
Party with the bitches at the bus stop, why not?
Loud motherfuckers at the 24 IHOP
Fuck you, Fuck you, Fuck you, Fuck you, Not you, you’re cool
Half baked, and I’m looking for that Oracle bitch
Tryna find answers just like you
Just like you, yeah I'm just like you
But I got a whip and a chick plus two
We’re the role models that you look up to
Fuck high school let's get mushrooms
Confucius and cow shit that's awesome
Money stretched like Dhalsim
My gang is full of bosses

[Hook]
Hey

Woof
I'm Genghis Khan
Ho

Woof
I'm Genghis khan
Ho
Hey where you from
Woof
I'm Genghis Khan
Ho

I'm Genghis Khan

[Verse 2]
Mustache is a must-have
If you wanna rule like a king gotta look like one
Drink like one, smoke like one
Be ready for a little bit of fistfight fun
Knockout punch with a roundhouse kick
Shoes off motherfucker, bow down bitch
Shitty flows go where the outhouse is
Chicka bow wow got your girl down for sex
Alpha male, I'm rollin' up L's as big as *[Fidel's] cigars
Ho
*[Trip of the] scales, I'm tipping the scales
Korean Abdul Jabar, ho
Don't piss me off
Got a gift from God
Came up poor Les Miserables
Me and yo hood, it's different dawg
Yo Mr. Rogers I'm City of God
24K, no switchblades, AK47 warpaint face
Better obey, bro we pace
Gotta pick a side like the OJ case
Lord of the Flies, Where the Wild Things Are
Start a big brawl like the Foxhills mall
Stain on your shirt like BBQ sauce
Blood from your jaw being cracked by Khan
(Khan)
You know the name
Yeah motherfuckers you know the name
Can't spell Ganghis (Genghis) without the Gang
We take prisoners, fuck yo chain
Don't bang, I bang hoes, I'm bankroll pursuing
But roll up lil Youngin and you better know what you doin'!

[Hook]
Hey
Where you from
Woof
I'm Genghis Khan
Ho
Hey, where you from
Woof
I'm Genghis khan
Ho
Hey where you from
Woof
I'm Genghis Khan
Ho
I'm Genghis Khan
I'm Genghis Khan

[Outro]
Fe-fi-fo-fum we be startin wars fo' fun
Why you throwin' up that peace sign when peace ain't gon' come
Fe-fi-fo-fum we be startin wars fo fun
Why you throwin' up that peace sign when peace ain't gon' come
