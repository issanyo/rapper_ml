[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Daddy was a G, granddaddy was a G too
They never bang, they always seemed to keep cool
At least they seemed to so deceitful
Cigarette bud after bud
Pound the city just run them up
Chug and a chug and he got a problem
Trying to make a motherfucking buck
Turns out everybody knew his name
Like worm with the perm out in the K
Walking to places first name basis
Bow to the waist like "right this way"
People were looking at pops like Moses
Dropping a basket of roses
Hustling 24 making that honeycomb
How could I never have known this?

[Hook 1: Dumbfoundead]
Heroes ain't voted by people we chosen
Genghis my bloodline, gangsters my old hits
Gangster ancestor's ancestors
I got gangster ancestor's ancestors

[Hook 2: Donye'a G]
All of these gangsters, running my bloodline
Running my history, don't try to run mine
I bet you done it, we've done it for me
They ain't fucking with me

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Fuck your hand gestures your stepsons
Y'all can run my ancestry no question
Check my pedigree, my family forever be
I can feel the energy, you can see my inner G
I can see your inner bitch, that shit running through your genes
My mama fuck a bitch up too
My sister, she might just cut you
My auntie, she hella peaceful
But my uncle, he like "whaddup fool, whaddup fool, whaddup fool"
My family told me not to trust you
We crossed the border with the drug mules
Ain't no hood we can't adjust to

[Hook 1: Dumbfoundead]
Heroes ain't voted by people we chosen
Genghis my bloodline, gangsters my old hits
Gangster ancestor's ancestors
I got gangster ancestor's ancestors

[Verse 3: Year Of The Ox]
I remember eating oxtail watching Bronx Tale
My father bought the soap opera bento
Who's a real gangster to you son, my father asked me is it Sonny or Lorenzo
He said true strength is love
But I was young and I didn't understand what he meant though
See, that way of thinking it was stupid of me
And I looked at my dad like "what are you talking about?"
Generations can repeat crazy
Our bloodline had some 미친 새끼's
I got too many brothers that prefer the meat cleavers and Miyagi's
‘Cause how sharp those nigiri blades be
Running through the city screaming you didn't pay me
Pops wasn't in a mob but the business he gave me
My forefathers couldn't foreshadow what was forthcoming
So they figured out a way to degrade me
Our granddaddy's granddaddy was a grandmaster
See they would have to bow to him
And because of his presence they come up with presents
That they would bring around to him
Now my [?] were remade
I make sure that people heard of me
And I can't help but say that my ancestors' face
Is printed on the front of currency

[Hook 1: Dumbfoundead]
Heroes ain't voted by people we chosen
Genghis my bloodline, gangsters my old hits
Gangster ancestors ancestors
I got gangster ancestors ancestors

[Hook 2: Donye'a G]
All of these gangsters, running my bloodline
Running my history, don't try to run mine
I bet you done it, we've done it for me
They ain't fucking with me
