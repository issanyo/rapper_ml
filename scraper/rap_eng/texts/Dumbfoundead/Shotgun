[Verse 1]
Getaway car, no road maps
Memory gone, no throwbacks
What if we leave never go back
Don't think hard, don't hold back
Let's just go
Your two jobs, your landlord
Girl you ain't gotta stand for this bullshit
Just hop in, middle fingers up
Let's bounce we out in a new whip
You saying that I lost my mind
Trust me I'm feeling fine
Just thought about the best time
That I ever had is when we bumped and grind
Why not let it last for a lifetime
Blow tree 'til the sun go down
Beach side while we sipping on a Mai Tai
Let me get you one more round
Girl you ain't no trophy wife
Why the fuck you want that life
You don't want that hold me tight
You the pull you hair and choking type
I'm that man, you that girl
Do that dance that I like so much
I like your touch, you like my car
Then put your bags inside that trunk

[Hook]
What's a brand new car without a bad bitch
Riding shotgun on the run to the casket
If the cops come, come she know where to stash it
Got her hair blowing in the wind with the ashes

[Verse 2]
5'7, brunette
New life, no debt
Bright red, Corvette
Where the fuck shall we go next?
Clean slate with no past
We change cars in El Paso
Pass through as no mans
And now we build our own castle
Shotgun, shotgun, yeah she ridin' shotgun
Wreckin', Rolling light it up
And we flying high like Top Gun
She got guns in her Prada bag
And ain't afraid to pop one
Fuck a bad she's fucking bad
Y'all ever see a cop run?
Mexico Patron shots
Roleplay at the checkpoint
Drove through them road blocks
Man they gave us no choice
I tell her take the wheel
It's getting way to real
She shooting 38's rocking heels
Skills

[Hook]
What's a brand new car without a bad bitch
Riding shotgun on the run to the casket
If the cops come, come she know where to stash it
Got her hair blowing in the wind with the ashes

[Verse 3]
Hotels, hair dyed
It's like a new girl every night
Fast life in paradise
We moving up to airlines
Hood chick ain't seen shit
Now she on that G6
Put her on that cruise ship
And see if she gets seasick
3 kids, 2 dogs
Big house with that white fence
You the type of down broad
I'm tryna' spend my life with
Back then we were broke honey
Came up on that coke money
So funny how life works
Turn light work to more money
Go clean like dope fiends
In rehab we road kings
Nah, this ain't a movie
We just living out our own scenes
You were down to ride
So I got you 'til I die
My shotgun, shotgun, always to my side

Let's just go
Let's just go
Let's just go
Let's just go

[Hook]
What's a brand new car without a bad bitch
Riding shotgun on the run to the casket
If the cops come, come she know where to stash it
Got her hair blowing in the wind with the ashes
