[Hook: KSCB]
I'mma do it myself cause I can't take no chances
I need money in my hand these niggas under handed
Everybody asking questions, ask me for the answers
Not 97, 98, or 99, I need a hunnid grand
Hunnid grand, hunnid grand, hunnid grand
I need a hunnid grand, hunnid grand
Hunnid grand, hunnid grand

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
My clothes smell like teen spirit, hoe gettin' it like Gene Simmons
Week benders with scene bitches, reached all of my three wishes
So fuck your lamp, fuck your cans, fuck your nose, fuck your plans
I'll sabotagin', and I'm analyzin' your moves, and man, I'm soo Japan
Soo ahead with my bread, you put five ahead on a gram
I do drugs with all of my fans, what's an autograph to a Xan?
Oh, you don't know a man, that'll represent like me, that love that pussy like it love me
Won't stop till hunnid grand is that fee, run it

[Hook: KSCB]
I'mma do it myself cause I can't take no chances
I need money in my hand these niggas under handed
Everybody asking questions, ask me for the answers
Not 97, 98, or 99, I need a hunnid grand
Hunnid grand, hunnid grand, hunnid grand
I need a hunnid grand, hunnid grand
Hunnid grand, hunnid grand

[Verse 2: KSCB]
I know that I'mma do it when they say I can't
I'm gettin' money everywhere they say I ain't, fuck 'em
They talkin' 'bout nothin', fuck 'em
Ain't no comments in your sentence, hol up, lemme interrupt you
I'm this business shit, get ugly, ain't no morals in the money
No forgiveness, no discussion
Y'all do it big, but just don't do it, I'mma do it, I'mma do it
I'm finessin', I maneuverin', cause I had to do it to ya

[Hook: KSCB]
I'mma do it myself cause I can't take no chances
I need money in my hand these niggas under handed
Everybody asking questions, ask me for the answers
Not 97, 98, or 99, I need a hunnid grand
Hunnid grand, hunnid grand, hunnid grand
I need a hunnid grand, hunnid grand
Hunnid grand, hunnid grand
