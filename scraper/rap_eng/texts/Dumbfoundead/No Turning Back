[Hook: Paul Kim]
Nobody knows where the chips may fall but I’m all in, I’m all in
There’s no turning back
Where do we go on a one way street with everything, I’m all in
There’s no turning back

[Verse 1:  Dumbfoundead (Parker)]
Go big or go home, my pops was a gambling man
Brought my family to the bittersweet life of Candyland
Yes I’m like my daddy way I manage with no travel plans
Going full speed ahead without giving a half a damn
Yeah, I’m that freestyler, make my life and words connect
Off the dome, living ain’t too sure about what’s coming next
Long as I live with no regrets I’ll have the perfect death
Found my calling since the purchase of my first cassette
And I ain’t look back since, turn my bookbags in
Never thought about what could have been
Shit, easy decision for a brother with no options left
It’s a luxury to be thinking about consequence
Feel me? For real, that’s that LA Life
Fuck a Plan B, Real G’s get Plan A right
That’s why I’m treating every day like a Saturday night
Til I get noticed I’ma stand in the light
Just roll the dice cause

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead (Parker)]
This the type of journey that’s a one way ticket
Take the red eye flight I roll one up and I hit it
The road is my religion, I’m a man on a mission
The moment I failed is when the fans don’t listen
Yeah, I got nothing for me to go back to
If you know where I was coming from you know that’s true
I got family that I owe that to
And I’ma do this 'til I’m in a rocking chair with a cold ass brew
Lady Luck’s blowing kisses, she’s teasing from a distance
Nothing but persistence, shortcuts lead to ditches
Long road ahead of me, with time as my enemy
The hustle and the grind is my fondest of memories
Call me a workaholic, I’m on that Steve Jobs
I’ve gone through nightmares for me to work this dream job
Ain’t no one ever make a difference by playing it safe
I’m going all in until I break the bank, break the bank

[Hook]

[Bridge: Paul Kim]
See I’ve been working overtime
Try to claim what I know is mine, yeah
There’s no turning back
I guess it’s called a one track mind
Cause I can see the finish line, yeah
There’s no turning back

[Hook]
