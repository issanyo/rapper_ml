[Hook: Breezy Lovejoy]
She's a bitch (biotch)
The meanest one that I've dealt with
But I love her and I can't help it
Cause she's a bitch (biotch)
And I ain't trying to be selfish
But if she ain't mine she's nobody elses
She's my bitch

[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
What a crazy bitch
The homies telling me this ain't the way to live
Every single day a different argument
Things are always shaky, call it Parkinson's
I hate to love her, love to hate her
Can't breathe without her, want to suffocate her
Every damn night we wake up the neighbors
Then the cops come, and I get fucking tasered
Then she has the nerve to break up with me
She be giving me reasons to break up the weed
Oh lucky me, just look at her
What she's doing is a crime, throw the book at her
She be flirting at the club just to get me pissed
So I holler at chick, like excuse me miss
But my girl, she the jealous type
Ya'll don't really understand, but the fellas might

[Hook: Breezy Lovejoy]

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
My ride or die bitch
2Pac, 96', Bonnie and Clyde shit
But she be flipping out on that Jekyll and Hyde tip
Tripping over some dumb nickel and dime shit
Devil woman with a ghetto lovin'
They told me not to play with fire
But I love her when I'm hated by her
My heart is a dangerous liar
She be bringing out my inner Too Short (bitch!)
The way I put up with her I'm a true sport
An LA chick, with her blue Cortez
Complicated, yes you sure is
A mastermind, she should take up chess
It ends all the time with some make up sex
Don't know what's next, I'm so upset
This crazy bitch makes me wanna throw up sets

[Hook: Breezy Lovejoy]

[Verse 3: Dumbfoundead]
Flying objects, broken windows
Ready for love cause that's what you're in fo'
Yelling, screaming, it ain't that simple
I took it for granted when I was single
You ain't been in love if you found it shockin'
Would ever chase your girlfriend down the block
Cause she got up and stormed out the restaurant
Straight arguing all day around the clock
Under a spell, overwhelmed
Can't picture myself with no one else
Blowing L's to cope with hell
Will we stay together, only time will tell
I know my chick can be a bitch at times
And she'll probably trip cause I spit that line
And a bitch like mine, they don't get that fine
Her love's a drug man I miss that high

(Guitar Solo!)
She's. My. Bitch
