[Chorus]
I put, them on, the wave
But today I'm feelin’ washed
And off, my game
Today, I feel, my age

[Verse 1]
I feel so ancient
They say Asian don't raisin
Went from young and the dangerous
To making all of my payments
When I get wasted as shit
It take two days to get fixed
They ask me whats your skin regiment
Bitch I drank like a fish
I done did everything, anything all in my teens
Uppers and downers, and all in between
Gave lovers the boot
And given them rings
From baggy to skinny
With all of my jeans
15 seconds of shine
Turn into six seconds on the vine
Now its real fake in real time
Acting hella extra on their live (stupid!)
Little homie flexin' that’s cute
They see my mural, like "That's you!"
Old man but everything brand new
Better cuff yo girl I still pull
I mind my business, y'all start wars
I'm Michael Jackson eatin' popcorn
But keep testin' and talk more
I'll send that ass to the chalkboard

[Chorus]
I put, them on, the wave
But today I'm feelin’ washed
And off, my game
And I feel my age
Never played it S-A-F-E
And I never let it stress me
Shoot my shot like Smith and Wesson
Up until they come arrest me
They keeping up the pace
But nothing stays the same
Yesterday I rage, but today I feel my age

[Verse 2]
What’s my age again, umm
What's your name again, hmm
Used to open up, now the main event
If I could rage again than I would
Go and peep the ATM, look
Yea I feed the fam like I should
I still represent the same hood
I’ll forever, ever, stay put, KTOWN!
A and r'd  the hardest artist
But you'd never know cause I'm modest
True I never signed on the dotted
But came out the game cum laude
Dearly departed
Y’all were like hot for a minute
But you wasn't on it
Shoulda been honest
You were so busy
Just lookin' at comments
Runnin' through thotties
And ran into problems
Still don't have a Lambo
But I'm eatin' well at Nandos
Walk in clubs with my sandals
Pull some strings like it's a banjo
I could prolly clear a sample
Old enough to be a sample
I just want a couple thank you's
And watch them bow down to my ankles

[Chorus]
I put, them on, the wave
But today I'm feelin' washed
And off, my game
And I feel my age
Never played it S-A-F-E
And I never let it stress me
Shoot my shot like Smith and Wesson
Up until they come arrest me
They keeping up the pace
But nothing stays the same
Yesterday I rage, but today I feel my age

[Outro]
If they forget my name
Wouldn't feel no type of way
Smile upon my face
But today I feel my age
Did what I came to do
Got nothing left to prove
I'm cashing out my youth
But today, I feel, my age
