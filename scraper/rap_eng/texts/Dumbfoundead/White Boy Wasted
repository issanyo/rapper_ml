We`re about to get WHITE BOY WASTED
Your Favorite Martian and Dumbfoundead
Getting crunk up in here!
We`re about to get
WHITE BOY WASTED

We stumble to the house party already buzzed
We get retarded when we start drinking Bacardi because
Getting wasted in the basement is our only obligation
Plus we don`t know the meaning of the word moderation

I`m, I`m crude when I talk
Shirt off, fist fighting every dude on the block
And then I`m hugging you
Like I ain`t gonna see you again
Like dude I freaking love you man!
Imma drunk dial my ex-girlfriend
But first I have to pass out and yack
In the downstairs bathroom
So raise your red cups up and make noise
Cause we drink like
Upper middle class teenage boys

Oh it`s the weekend
And you know what that means
Oh it means it`s time to party
It`s time to party

White boy, White, White boy wasted x 6

White boy wasted

Yo, last night I partied up at a frat house
It was full of college kids
Singing along to Smash Mouth
Half of them passed out
A fat dude with his ass out
Looking like John Belushi
In the movie Animal House
All of a sudden somebody yelled out
Keg stand
Tow jocks with tube socks and sweatbands
They pointed at me
And carried me by my legs man
I had to do it
It probably wasn`t the best plan
Next thing you know
It`s a beer pong and takin Jager shots
Now I`m in the corner and
Throwing up morning tater tots
Pissin on police cars
Yelling out I hate the cops
White boy with dreadlocks
Now give me major props

Oh it`s the weekend
And you know what that means
Oh it means it`s time to party
It`s time to party

White boy, White, White boy wasted x 8

Oh it`s the weekend
And you know what that means
Oh it means it`s time to party
Party

All I want to do
All I want to do is just get
White boy wasted

Oh it`s the weekend
And you know what that means
Oh it means it`s time to party
It`s time to party
