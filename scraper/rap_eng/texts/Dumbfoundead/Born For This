[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]
Yo
1986 a star was in the making,
I had no idea that the world was for the taking.
Received my education from the television stations,
My family never had them dinner conversations.
When they got back from work, you'd see their backs would hurt.
So I provided laughter, my earliest acting work
Doing dances, lip-syncing rappers
Impersonating Michael Jackson and Kung-Fu captions.
Ha, funny guy, never had the butterflies
Never shy, every five minutes I would improvise.
Class clown, had jokes before a peach fuzz,
Ask around, I was roasting them like peanuts
Dime bags in middle school, my Walkman
My life saver through dark days and lost angels
Fourteen candles when I wrote a sixteen
For the first time my first rhymes were shitty
So we practiced, and the homie tracked us
It attracted mad bitches to the mattress
Spent more time on my rapping than fractions
Dropped all my classes
Cause I was born for this...

[Hook]
I was born for this (I was born for this)
Yeah I was born for this (Yeah I was born for this)
I was born for this (I was born for this)
Yeah I was born for this

[Verse 2: Dumbfoundead]
Damn yo
Should of heard the corny Jackie Chan jokes
Thinking they were getting me when they're 'bout to get handled
Rambo killin', my crew like Sam Crow
Crammed seven in a van, man it wasn't grandiose, nah
Shows were grassroots
Before the cash road gas money tours we were sleeping on the floors
If you saw me and Zo way before then you would know
We have grown, if we had a chart it'd be a slope
Going up, up, see the slope going up
The student became the teacher now the kid blowing up
Don't ever leave a mic cold
Flow when the cameras roll
Signed that open mic list
Hunger should have told you this
Crenshaw or rock a Bar Mitzvah
Any chance I got was like that and like this ya'll
Takes ten years, not ten seconds to lift off
Stay patient and try not to get pissed cause
Fifteen year-old Jon would've served young'un
Nineteen year-old Jon would've served time
But Old Boy Jon, man he's out here having fun
And the best has yet to come
I was born for this...

[Hook]
I was born for this (I was born for this)
Yeah I was born for this (Yeah I was born for this)
I was born for this (I was born for this)
Yeah I was born for this
