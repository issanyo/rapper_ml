Hi haters, I'm back from a hiatus
Don't know what my name is? Then Spotify later
I'm a pro, you's a prototype; all your rhymes beta
You rappers undecided like a poli-sci major

Been reading novels as big as bibles, in different genres
From Murakami's to how to cultivate marijuana
Been eatin better from chicken burgers to parmigiana
They never loved us now they try to put their arm around us

No baby mamas and no debt, I'm a fuckin problem
Got a bitch that's mad rich in La Canada
Rumor has it that her daddy own Sriracha
If its ever out of business, I ain't ever have to stock up

Back up, yea parker be the name
Mothafuckas try to put me in a marketable lane
You can take all that bullshit to Barcelona, Spain
Im the head matador around these parts, it's the K

Town that is, renown that is
Got the baddest down yellow bitches around, ya dig
I might buy you cris, but that about it
Might light your cig, but that about it

Been goin in, straight underdog
One nation, under god fuck a blog
I seen too many rappers try to suck em off
But not jon, got my own dot com

So iconic, with a flow like god
They should have my statue on Vermont boulevard
Got a gang of broads, that look like nia long
That cook like lil b and fuck like bella donna

Pop pills the next morning its ox tail
Hot pots with smells that leave the block filled
Got Asian homies that sell rock and rock grills
And still helpin at the shop that there pops built

That side hustle there moma don't really know about , nah
She don't question as long as the envelope is out
Deliver money to her door, like the clearing house
Now that's a good son, something she can brag about

Harvard, Princeton, Berkley and Stanford
Booked in the top schools im loved by the chancellors
Came from the junkyard, Asian son of Sanford
I raised these kids now they raise em like the panthers

I ain't sayin im a pioneer
But I ain't sayin that im not
I was raised in the riot years, 92
While it was quiet on your block

You drive in a Passat, while Biting your croissant
Relying on your pops, to supply you with the guap
Your life is a facade you's a trust fund baby
You ain't on the list, you a plus one maybe

Catch me, wining and dining at line hotel
Pretty servers with the stripes lookin fine as hell
The homie roy, treat me like a top clientele
You know that's family, he never lets me buy my meals

On some goodfellas shit, Got hood yellow kids
Lookin up to a brother like he leads fellowships
You wanna hear a speech to achieve excellence
But my outreach tell em do as you wish

Use intuition and lose inhibitions
My major and minor were two intersections
My Professors are locked up or doped up
The ones we idolized now toast us

Used to chill at shatto park
Now im at chateau marmont
Came a long way now I'm on
Yo I'm back but for now I'm gone
