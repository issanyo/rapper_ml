[Verse 1: Dumbfoundead]

This one's for my 5th grade crush
My middle school make out sessions on the bus
Freshman hookin' up with high school sluts
Burnin' mixtapes with the bands that you love
House party hickey's, unhookin' that bra
Man it got real tricky but got them panties off
To my first girlfriend that had me feelin' sprung
Then it had to end man we were really young
For that rebound chick that I straight up use
To make an ex jealous I know it wasn't cool
For the girls that I smashed and never called back
For the bitches that diss me you ain't all that
For the groupies on the road that were droppin real low
For all the chicks sendin' titty flicks to my phone
For Jennifer and Joan they never got along
For that crazy ass bitch writin' 'bout me in her blog
For that one freak that added me on Facebook
For the heart breaker that got me writin' Drake hooks
For the ones I drugged out and the ones I sexted
Sorry that I showed up to your crib unexpected
This is for the one night stands and the two night stays
Three month relationships, few blind dates
For all the girls I mentioned I wanna thank yall
For helpin' me write this song
