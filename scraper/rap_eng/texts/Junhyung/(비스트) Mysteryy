Yeah, yeah, love is pain, love is pain
Love is over, love is over, that, that, that’s it
O-o-o-o-over, love love is pain, pain
O-o-o-o-over, love, break it
You are full of Mystery, Mystery
Mystery, Mystery
Mystery, Mystery
I don’t even know you anymore
This is full of Mystery, Mystery
Mystery, Mystery
Mystery, Mystery

Look here, look at me I am in front of you
We were fine until last night
Why are you avoiding me all of sudden
I worry and worry but I don’t know why

B-b-b-b-break it, oh, la-la-la-lady
The question you can’t know
Who do you think you are
(Why-why-why-why is it me-me-me-me)
Making things hard for me

You tell me, tell me why
You show me, show me why
Why do you do that to me, why why
You tell me, tell me why
You show me, show me why
Oh the irony, am I that unwanted

You really are a Mystery, Mystery, girl
Mystery, mystery scene
Mystery, Mystery love
I don’t even know you anymore
This is a Mystery, Mystery, girl
Mystery, Mystery scene
Mystery, Mystery love

Burst, burst, go crazy, at the verge of going nuts
Gotta resist, resist, but even with the resistance
It’s part of your plan
Maybe, maybe this isn’t it
Absolutely, absolutely ain’t no girl
I worry and worry but I don’t know why

B-b-b-b-break it, oh, la-la-la-lady
The question you can’t know
Who do you think you are
(Why-why-why-why is it me-me-me-me)
Making things hard for me

You tell me, tell me why
You show me, show me why
Why do you do that to me, why why
You tell me, tell me why
You show me, show me why
Oh the irony, am I that unwanted

Why are you making things hard for it
I’ve done everything you’ve wanted
One two, as time flies my heart hours more
Again, again, again, I think
More more more my heart hurts
If you want something
Please go back how you were

I don’t even know you anymore
Should I dissappeare for you
If I am unwanted or if you don’t like me anymore
I will go away

You really are a Mystery, Mystery, girl
Mystery, mystery scene
Mystery, Mystery love
I don’t even know you anymore
This is a Mystery, Mystery, girl
Mystery, Mystery scene
Mystery, Mystery love

You tell me, tell me why
You show me, show me why
Why do you do that to me, why why
You tell me, tell me why
You show me, show me why
Oh the irony, am I that unwanted

You really are a Mystery, Mystery
You’ve changed all of sudden
Now that’s Mystery, Mystery, different from yesterday
This is a Mystery, Mystery
I am not any different
Mystery, Mystery
