*TRANSLATION*
I'll back off so you can live
Say it directly
Looking at me
Say it looking into my eyes
Did you just say you wanted to break up?
Did you want to end it with me?
(I know) You probably got a lady
(I know) You probably got sick of me
Even though the tears are rushing to me
I'll back off so you can live
That is all i can say
I'll forget you so you can live better
I'll back of so you can live
So that you will be happy without me
The Love you tossed away
You can take it
Don't leave even a trace behind and take it all
Don't even say you are sorry
Don't worry about me
Sorry My Sweety
Your lips that told me that you were going to leave
Why does it give me a reason to be angry today?
I need to stop you
The words don't go out
And you are already moving far apart
(I know) You will forget me
(I know) I will really hate you
Even though you know everything
I'll back off so you can live
That is all i can say
I'll forget you so you can live better
I'll back of so you can live
So that you will be happy without me
The Love you tossed away
You can take it
Don't leave even a trace behind and take it all
Don't even say you are sorry
Don't worry about me
(You) The reason i lived
(You) You were all i wanted
You~
It was me who only looked at you
(Why) Why are you leaving?
(Why) Why are you tossing me away?
If you were going to be like this
Why did you love me in the first
Place?
Do you happen to remember that day?
That day when we first met
I still remember it
The promise you made to me
That you will only care for me
That you will only protect me
That you will only love me
I believed your lies
I believed it
(Oh) Oh Oh Oh Oh
Did you really love me?
(Oh) Oh Oh Oh Oh
No No No No
(Oh) Oh Oh Oh Oh
I'll forget so you can live better
