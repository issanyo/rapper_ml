[Intro]

South Park Coalition is a wreckless clan (4x)
South Park Coalition is a-- (3x)
South Park Coalition is a wreckless clan


[Verse 1: Gangsta Blac]

Muthafuck being broke
I'm down with death and the cash flow
Here go my badge
Now put the money inside, hoe
Staring with a evil ass frown
Now all the rest of you muthafuckas, get down
I'm scandalous with tool in hand
Cuz this shit going just as it's fuckin planned
Got a bag full of money
And a loaded gat too
The sounds of sirens
Damn, here comes the boys in blue
But when we get through
They gonna be the boys in the red
Fill 'em up with lead
Send them hoes to the med
We started gunnin'
And they I saw was gunsmoke
And bullets flying in the air

(South Park Coalition is a--)

They started shootin' back
Then releasing Tear-Gas
But yo, we still survived
I woke up in a police car, hogtied
With blood runnin down face

(South Park Coalition is a--)

And the law tryna send me to a concrete place
Where all the warriors roam
Pretty soon, its the place that I will be calling my home
All because a nigga went on a spree
Now Im down and charged with armed robbery

[Verse 2: Gangsta Blac]


Get down, a goddamn it
Anybody try to make a move
And watch me ram this;
Glock up yo ass like a dick, bitch
I wanna rich trick cuz I ain't got shit
I been broke since my muthackin date of birth
I tried to work like a jerk
But it didn't work
Now I gotta reach for my thang
So spite that Glock
Here's another trick slang
No need to start tripping
You done act a damn fool
A talking bad nigga
Boy, you pissing off my cool
Or put something in the clip
And watch how I react
A 9 to your head
And I wish that you talk back
I hate to see a young nigga rolling in this shit
Especially when I know
That I was suppose to be enriched
So now Im on a mission
A mission of a taking
Or easily bailing from the cheese
That tricks are making
And If I see you
Looking gooder than me, trick
A click to ya dick
Drop it off you son of a bitch
I got my pistol to yo head
Trick, you ain't did nothing
Take your jacket, take your shoes
Take your jewelry, Ill take something
Hit the sucka in his face
And now you know he's hollering
Open up his mouth
M11, he be swallowing
Following my mind
I didn't have time to leave, see
Now I'm hogtied
Cuz I'm down for armed robbery

South Park Coalition is a wreckless clan (4x)

[Verse 3: Gangsta Blac]

8 months done pass
And I've seen no kind of sun
Mad as fuck with a 60 thousand dollar bond
It's South Park for life
I got my roadies, my pride
And my pocket knife
We started heading towards the front
Towards these 2 fools
That tried to pull a stunt
We started kickin' and stickin' on them fools
We took they're life
Along with their muthafuckin shoes
And then we walked away; head up
Me and my roadies had out pocket knifes covered up
We spread it out as we walked away
And then the guards came in from the back way
Now they got the upper hand
Just because they got a badge
And a muthafuckin gun in they hand
They sent us back to the cell
But yo, the guards
Were hotter than the flames in hell
But yo, Im cold as ice
I take out any nigga if you a a reasonable price
Cuz I gotta stay paid, ya see
Gimme a gat
And I have to commit a robbery

[Verse 4: Gangsta Blac]


Now I was staring pretty hard
Looking straight through some bars
Doing things I never did
Always arrested as a kid
But now things are kinda hectic
In the streets, I could not make it
Living but Im somewhere trapped
I dont think Im gonna make it
Niggas try to help me out
I refuse to let 'em, yo
Only thing that can help me
Is some funk or some Indo
Living in some hard bars
Kinda having hard times
Having fatal thoughts of suicide
Flowing in my mind
If I make it out this place
Promise I'm not coming back
If I have to leave the track
That's what I'ma have to do, Jack
Naw, let's kick down from the old skool, fool
Assassination is what Im thinking
Cuz Im lacking education
Father vamped off the camp
So the streets brought me up
Strange, never borrowing nothing
That be said from another mane
Fuck that trick talking shit
I dont wanna hear it, G
Cuz all I be thinking
Is another armed robbery
