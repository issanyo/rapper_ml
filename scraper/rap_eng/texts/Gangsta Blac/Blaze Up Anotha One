(Blac talking)
Yeah up in this motherf**ka
G-A-N-G-S to the motherf**kin' A motherf**ka
I got my brother Cool B, my nigga Berm on the side ah me
Dre house, my cousin K-Mud throwin' thug, S-P-V motherf**ka

(Hook)
Bla, bla, blaze up anotha one trick
We ain't finished yet
F**k that busta kill that sucka
F**k that busta kill that sucka

Bla, bla, blaze up anotha one trick
We ain't finished yet
F**k that busta kill that sucka
*gunshots*

(Verse 1)
Creep up on yo funky ass, yeah I got a careless nigga
Blast four times to the spine, now a dead nigga
Broke out, my bank real quick, blaze anotha one
Smellin' dead bodies mixed wid weed psychopathic son
My brother gon' smother motherf**kas for the f**k of it
K-Mud ever thug, crackin' scrugs, tyin' up some shit
Jumpin' in the rental Continental hit the town right
Twenty-one, dollars in my pocket makes a long night
Climbin' while I'm drivin' motherf**kas we be gettin' it on
Just awaken shaken once again, so you know it's on
In the hood, crazy motherf**kas born night and day
Gangsta just be one, out the pack, straight from Parkway
Tanqueray, sippin' city dippin', keep my game strong
Ignorant ass bitches interferrin' but I'm smokin' on
Never let anotha motherf**ka come and disrespect
He die if I'm high, blaze anotha we ain't finished yet, bitch!

Hook (2x)

(Verse 2)
Chiefin' hay, every-day, the Southern way
Totin' nines I'm color blind, I'm straight for mine
You can call it what you want, I really don't care
The life I live is motherf**k it, a do or dare
A couple ah jackers, I need some cheese wid my crackers
I'm tryna stack up, my dividends to the max
Don't try to test, without no f**kin' bullet proof vest
Boom, boom, boom, another bloody murder mess
No time to waste, my face paste wid ah frown
A madman, only weeeeed can calm me down
No love for scrubs, cause scrubs ain't never did shit for me
No love for the other man
Cause the brother man lives the world so lonely
A nigga lim' dimin' late night climbin' as chief Blac would say
And nuff respect to my niggas on South Parkway
Yes we be chiefin' hay every motherf**kin' day
Yes we be doin' it the Southern way nigga

Hook (2x)

(Verse 3)
Rumblin' through the cars just like a blind man
My destiny is to get paid understand man
A mister motherf**kin' genius, I f**kin' mean this
True to this game cause I'm a thug, doped out on drugs
My nigga B he got a juice, and some ah that hype
Lil Man know when it be on cause it's a quiet night
A dice game whip ya 'erves, what's up my nigga
Tay Baby got some f**kin' hyper if you smokin' nigga
Inspect the Gangsta once I change, I thought you knew
Go tuck your nuts cause ain't no guts, up in this fool
But to my niggas who be jailin', like psycho P
And Hardtime and Dunno D, up in the streets
We standin' down 'til they act up, I pull my gak up
If they get shot up cause they f**ked up, without they nuts up
Cause ain't no suckas in this hood, it's all good
Don't try to change the f**kin' channel, I wish ya would

Hook ('til fade variations camp; talking)
YO! G-UP
