[Intro: Playa Fly]
And we ain't playin' witcha'
South sucka

[Chours: Playa Fly & Crowd]
Break the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law

[Verse 1: Playa Fly]
I bring your court procedures, your regulations and rules
I bring your tickets, citations, and registrations to who?
Fly need no limits no boundaries
You just get from behind me
I live the Mafia livin', lil' Tee the laws won't come find me
Got so much love for my thugs
And even more for my drugs
And we ain't lovin' this law, so break the law and get buck
I-B-N buckin' the system
Cuz the system's a hizzoe (ho)
And I don't care 'bout no law, cuz Uncle Sam is my negro
Your constitution's a fraud
Your Bill of Rights is to slaw
And since it's first amendment, freedom speech
I say, "Break the law"
I'm gone be hizigh (high) forever
No matter who say whatever
No peckerwoods or Oreos, be stoppin' this fella
Your prosecution's a crock!
And us young bucks got 'em hot
With blue troops in blue suits, they can't make us stop
And I'll continue to rock
In ways that I'll cut 'em raw
And we ain't takin' violations, exhibit breakin' the law
So break the law!

[Verse 2: Terror]
Aiyyo Blackout
Pass me the torch, I'm ready to scorch
Bustin' out the back, of the track
With the flamory force, we tired of your noise
Watch the grin and the talk still in my voice
Nobody in, nobody hustle quick to hate on them boys
Ain't playin' with toys, in fact, y'all might bust 'cause I'm bored
You callin' the court ask me for six I laugh and you get ignored
Murderin' Child, Pops should have been wearin' a bra
The way they had yo ass run, I thought you was a track star
That's on the raw, haters I'mma pull out the grain
What's my name? Terror down for cockin' and aim
That's hard as me man, get yo weapon, I'mma prove he can't hang
Break da law, some super slaw but this the ninety-nine thang
Rad Rapper, please watch me rock like O.C's
Drama I stay on Nestie, If you wanna test me
Come to the Ave. get yo' ass broke down like a Ki
Three to the M, Taylor B, and I'm Playa Posse
Watch me empty 'em all out, it's all on me
See everybody got them sells for a Q P
See Break Da Law!

[Chours: Playa Fly]
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law

[Verse 3: Playa Fly]
T-R-I-P
L-E
B-I-T-C-H
Fly comin' with no time to waste
Bigger and better, I'm strapped with Terror
And skills wherever
You Devil's need protection like a bombing shelter
Like stormy weather
Remove your roof, by tellin' the truth
By year two, and your entire cowardly group
Hey handyman, you actually cannot stand to me
And what's that young cocksucker name who playin' around with tee?
One murdering child, have your family worryin' awhile
Drink up some Mo', and take a champagne shower in style
And break up the slaw, while we be yellin' break the lizaw (law)
And break up the raw, and put an empty one in my jaw
And every lizaw that I break will be upon your back
And yo' that gay-blade-ass bitch, he just ain't talkin' bout jack
See mane this Terror and this Playa never hated you haters
If a playa' hate a hater that won't make me no faker
Fly rise and shine, represent mine, so break the lizaw
With Gangsta behind me so your cast is off
And if fall bitches tizalk (talk) shizit (shit)
You should be lockin' your jaw
'Cause it's makin' me, makin' me, makin' me, makin' me break the law
Break the law!

[Verse 4: Gangsta Blac]
Takin' the stick, and break 'dat stick down to 'bout six
Lil' pieces n discs cause I'm that nigga that started all this
Not takin' no fame, no need for me to state my full name
I'm known to campaign and known to Break the Law for some change
I'm the roughest, toughest, Mother Fucka, that Hood Star
From South Park for you Mother Fucka
You can't deny that Gangsta Blac don't keep it rzaw, and
Down to Break The Lzaw, and
Head just to make, that's what you szaw
Believe we platinum status, we mackin' through this game mane, and
If we keep it real and stay focus upon this game mane
If we can pay for it then, C-bill will have to come through
A lesson should be deep in his dream 'bout this shit blew
Yeah! Now how ya' like that

[Chorus: Playa Fly]
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law, breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law, breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law, breakin' the law, breakin' the law
Breakin' the law, breakin' the law, breakin' the law, breakin' the law
