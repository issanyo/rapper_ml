[Verse 1: Playa Fly]
You rather see me abolished than see Lil Flizy demolished
And do some damage and punish, and do away with your garbage
Too many stares and mugs, instead of smiles and hugs
Like Womack looking for love, for us, wherever it was
With darker faces of hate, who wait and pray that I vanish
And if they could man they would, take Mr. Flizy and banish
Or just eradicate Ibn eternal breathing suspensions
Nor be the blood in my heart, in lines of chalk on position
Then know so many would laugh, and say that's good for his ass
But what would Minnie and Bill do if Fly lay 'fore they pass?
My circumstances and chances, I take a' follies and fumbles
When Fly stay flat on my feet, I hear no giggles and mumbles
You sit more silent then lambs, I blind, shine the land
But not as hard as I can, cause it's too fatal to stand
And this beneficient gift from G.O.D Fly keep
Without him givin' me speech I blow my brains on my feet
And Playa

[Hook: Gangsta Blac] 2x
Fly write sum bump to take the pain out
If he wasn't high he probably try to blow his brains out
He's hopeless, this shit was in us as a baby
Taylor B and Minnie May Mafia gone crazy
Forgive us!

[Verse 2: Playa Fly]
The game was put off in me, 'fore I was put in the game
And Fly was going through struggles, before I'm knowing my name
With me and muff in a bug, two towns above I was drugged
Left Bill with no knowledge of, this can't be motherly love
Muskegon heights where she fled, but later ran into feds
She move that boy and that girl, right where we rested our heads
And stay a wrath on the scene, I'm reachin two years in age
Left by a pole and a pamper and shedded tears full of rage
I told her I wanna go, and that's what started to hurt her
She cried I'm going downtown and you can't go its too dirty
And now my that my muff abducted, I'm left alone and corrupt
But to my rescue he flew, with no if, and's or but's
Off in a '72 impala with Jackie poo
They came and got playa, playa just like not nothing was new
And to this day he been resting and SPV catching blessings
And thank Allah for my father and for the son he requested
And Playa

[Hook: Gangsta Blac] 2x
Fly write sum bump to take the pain out
If he wasn't high he probably try to blow his brains out
He's hopeless, this shit was in us as a baby
Taylor B and Minnie May Mafia gone crazy
Forgive us!

[Verse 3: Gangsta Blac]
My minds premeditated, have mercy on the casualty and tongue-tied stupid
Conversation only stop if he, hold up, buck, read what you wrote up, duck
Sho' enough a showdown, what, brave enough to buck up with chuck
See bitch we known for all this shit, without dictatin' alibis
And we gone from all this shit, see bitch traitin' didn't get us bye
Its heartache and pain, bitch cause we through in the brain
But we gonna keep all our composure, enough to maintain thangs
Swiftly shaken from conversation bout' me and Fly way of life
See Blac down wit Fly, Fly down wit Blac, with the otherside
This game for gamin on em, I'll act a flat monkey on em
They head stay turnin don't it, our names gonna bring it to em
If I could say my few words, I probably would speak it all
You think we deaf and retarded and buried from all yall
We slam on plenty beef, trapped up in my cranium
I swear Fly will damage 'em everytime I depend on him, nigga!

[Hook: Gangsta Blac] 2x
Fly write sum bump to take the pain out
If he wasn't high he probably try to blow his brains out
He's hopeless, this shit was in us as a baby
Taylor B and Minnie May Mafia gone crazy
Forgive us!

[Verse 4: Playa Fly]
I have no belief in a genie nor have no belief in the gin
Nor falling stars, or Gazoo, or Oz's wizard to lend
A helpin hand on my case, adversity faced the Mae
It ain't no sweat off my back, to bring Allah in tha place
I feel that wishes show envy, and what I need He'll send me
And Fly deserve what I want, thats why Im flexin my pimpin
And for my wife and my kids, Fly build a castle so big
Our money be like McDuck, and just for fun lil Fly gig
With Taylor baby Fly ride, and plan to do this for life
With so much love for this brother, thats its removing my pride
And all the time that we lost, can't bring it back cause its bought
We remember whats in us and all the battles we fought
Whether their mental or physical, or social or spiritual
Some back if you got it Blac, from this individual
And Fly gonna shut up, and let the gangsta cut up
Im from the M to the third, with taylor baby so buck
And Playa
