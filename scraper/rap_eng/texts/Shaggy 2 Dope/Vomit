[Verse 1: Violent J]
Erica was a beautiful girl even without her makeup
She was something stunning from the fucking time she wake up
She had many sugar daddies paying for her needs
They never knew about each other or her evil deeds
She was self vindictive and wicked into shame
God gave her that beauty, but ugly was her brain
As the years went by she continued using suckers
Hard working individuals who gave all just to fuck her
As Erica grew older, her looks begin to fade
She's spent every dime they had to surgically upgrade
But that would only last so long as time continues ticking
The eviler that Erica grew as now she's old and bitching
She died up in her older lady laying in her coffin
Few saw her funeral as none would visit often
Her soul dropped into hell screaming as she plummets
Beelzebub welcomes her as on her face he vomits

[Hook 1: Violent J]
On her face he vomits
On her face he vomits
Beelzebub welcomes her as on her face he vomits

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
John was a wealthy kid who had all that he wanted
Taught only in the finest schools he shut up like a comic
Graduating college, the world rests in his hands
Never thinking of the greedy or trying to understand
He landed at high paying job, his wealth accumulated
Charities that's often but only left degrading
He married and had children, but money's what he loved
He never had time for his kids as out his way he shoved 'em
He grew older in this fashion and never was he proud
Of anything that they accomplished at 'em, he screamed loud
Finally one of his sons who've felt rejected and neglected
Commited suicide and John still didn't correct it
John grew older rich and greedy and he died this way
His kids they really care less, but this ain't never said
His soul dropped into hell screaming as he plummets
Beelzebub welcomes him as on his face he vomits

[Hook 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
On his face he vomits
On his face he vomits
Beelzebub welcomes him as on his face he vomits

[Bridge: Violent J & Young Wicked]
If the heavens above had rejected your soul
Never are you lost without a place to go
Deeper to the bottom of hell's eternal fire
You are always welcome to come and retire
