(Violent J talking)
"Yea..it seem like...it seem like you always tryin' to get to a certain point you know what i'm sayin? Once you get there it ain't what you thought it was, so even the realest mother fuckers...mother fuckers seem like they got it made, they got fantasies...there's no end to a fantasy, once you meet your fantasy you got 5 more fantasies...that's real...c'mon wit' it Foe Foe"

(Monoxide Child)
It's all about the money, hoes and gats
And hangin' wit' my Rydas smokin' bat, after bat, after bat, what?
Cadillac, bitch we full fledgin
Raised up in the hood like a legend, always contendin'
'Cuz the top is where i'm headed
Top of the world, I got the Rydas and diamonds it's all imbeded uh
I'm smokin' an ounce, another mission keepin' you hoes on your toes
The Foe Foes about to blow, blaw!
Give it to me, I want it all for me, i'm greedy
Fulfillin' my Ghetto Fantasy, so fuck the needy
(Blaze) (Overlap)
I was born in the ghetto, where all my folks stay
Dreams of black trucks with bumps and pushin' weight
Livin' like a superstar, hookin' up wit' Mel Farr
Gettin' him high, and runnin' out for new cars
'Cuz where I grew up I wasn't worth a dime
Crips with no lifes, where I spend my time
One up top, steady hot, and now for one time
Bright and wise, Blow a 9, pullin' knives on a sucka'
'Cuz I was a broke mother fucka
'Til I got wit' the Rydas, started sportin' black trucks, uh

"Ghetto Fantasies,love don't like here anymore"
Rydas are for real, Rydas are for life
Rydas do it wrong, until they do us right y'all x2

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I make my Ghetto Fantasies into realities
Paid-ass Rydas, wit' ghetto mentalities
Growin' up without shit, no skrilla
From crack houses, to mansion's in the hills
And a big black truck wit' the bump in the driveway
Back in the day Full Clip didn't have it that way
Try to Ride on my shit, ima hafta see you in your hood
All my fantasies came true now, hollar at Bullet
(Violent J)
Uh, Ryda trucks, I wanna buy one of them
Just 'cuz it say's "Ryda" on the side of'em
I wanna fleet of trucks, to carry all my bucks
And fuck mud ducks, and wearin' tux, like Chucks
'Cuz this sucks, I ate so much Raymond Pride
I'm startin' to think it's my name (What up Raymond?) uh
I'm gettin' by on powdered milk and a can of peas
But the best thing in my life is free
My fantasies
Chorusx2

(Jamie Madrox)
Well basicaly, my Ghetto Fantasy has gotta be
A way to get me and my people outta this society
I'm tryin' G, but you ain't helpin' me by battling me
And askin' me how tought me and the Rydas be
We need to, get it together, before it fall apart
So gimme all your shit, my gat is aimed straight at your heart
But i'm ruthless, and I gotta get's what's mines
And i'm breakin' fools off in the drive-thru and now what?
(Myzery)
My Ghetto Fantasy's to roll wit' a million G's
Rydas like me, ready to die like me
Blazin' pounds of weed 'til my fuckin' eyes bleed
Menageatrois's like mu' fuckers what we need
The weed be them thugs Rydin
Prepare to bust, Psychopathic Rydas
Have the pigs getta buzz
But if they ever kill us then our souls will remain
Dwellin' in they brain 'til they blow a fuckin' vein (And that's real y'all)
Chorus
