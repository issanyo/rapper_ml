Industrial wasted the whole hood is
Toxic smoke for all ya little kids
Bring the family, come down to delray
Where the nuclear air will microwave your brain
Straight dogs get fat like wild boars
Attackin in packs and bringing down the doors
Giant rats, big as five feet long
Some even got wings, attack you airborne
We go fine ho's, hot as can be
But she might have a hand growing outta her knee
Don't bother me my little homie gots a duck head
I tell him "quack" like it was nothing said
Bitches round her are radio active
Burn right through any provocative
Right here is where ya wanna vacation
'less you scared of a little radiation

(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
It's a wonder place to stay!
Do it in Delray!
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
It's a wonder place to stay!
Do it in Delray!

A truck spilled plutonium all over the streets
Mutating everybody into freaks
I gotta nose growin' outta my forehead
I'm living in an old nuclear warhead
Siamese twins are born in 5 packs
Ninjas with legs growin outta their backs, kickin' it
Let it rain, let it drip hot acid
Do it in delray! It's fantastic!
Come visit, ain' nothing exquisite
Something run about you have you screaming "what the fuck is it?"
Air's fucked up, so you lucked up
Grow a mouth under your ear that never shuts up
No hotels, just crash in the trash
Oh that smell is just atomic gas
This is the place for you and your loved ones
Poisonous, deadly, sickly and Fun!

(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
It's a wonder place to stay!
Do it in Delray
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
It's a wonder place to stay!
Do it in Delray

I was attacked by somethin'
Half man, half opossum
Any fucking who that shot him
But it wouldn't die
I shot it some mo'
It just kept going
The dope man's got a fish head
With a hook in his lip
He don't care if you look
But don't trip
A chemically molded, beautiful place
(Ew that bitch got a dick growing outta her face)
Come and climb a smoke stack and take a hit
Take a look into the black smoke bottomless pit
My face feels hot, I feel it meltin'
Seconds later that man was a skeleton
No food, no shopping plaza malls
Just a seven legged man that crawls
An he'd sparen' you a dime or two
Bring the family through
This is the place to do!

(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
It's a wonder place to stay!
Do it in Delray
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
It's a wonder place to stay!
Do it in Delray
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway bo-oring
(Every body dies) Everybody dies anyway so why not
It's a wonder place to stay!
Do it in Delray
