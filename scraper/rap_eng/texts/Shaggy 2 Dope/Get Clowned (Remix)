[Verse 1: Violent J]
Abracadabra, stab you up bloody
I'm the big duke, smear your ass like putty
That's one thing I ain't never done was study
Fuck my meds, I'm about to go nutty
If we was in prison I'd rape your anus
With this broomstick, not my penis
I do a drive by on a pogo stick
As I'm getting my dick sucked, no bullshit
I clown motherfuckers, pie to the face
Probation officers, I lie to they face
I sell fake dope, and you still buy it
I even tell you it's fake
"I'll still try it"
I'll sock your ass, and leave you snoring
Still laid out same spot next morning
I'm a serial killer, pound for pound
You fuck with a Juggalo: you get clowned

[Chorus]
Get clowned
Pie to your face
Get clowned
Foot up your anus
Get clowned
Nuts on your chin
Then we do it again bitch
You get clowned
X2

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I'm Shaggy the clown
My foot swing around
Put your nuts so far up your ass
They're never found
Now eyeballs in the microwave grow fatter
Until they finally splatter
How do I know this? It don't matter
When I pulls out my axe hoes scatter
Cause in my head I hear the drums of war
Next thing you know, I comes to your door
And I kicks it in, the shit begin
Take a knife to the chicken and I sticks it in
Plug the feathers
Cut your tethers, everybody run free
Dumping in a humvee
Mass pandemonium all around
Innocent victim dying on the ground
Hold him close as his heart slow down
And then whisper in his ear hole, "YOU GOT CLOWNED!"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Violent J]
I paint my face like my brothers and sisters
We're misunderstood by these others, they diss us
Truth is these haters want to love us and kiss us
Cause they're secretly hound dogs, we shove'em when they piss us off

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
We gotta clown these hoes
Stick our big clown shoes all up their assholes
Cause when our wagons come to town
We only pick up the found, bitch
So get clowned

[Chorus x2]
