[Shaggy 2 Dope]
(Shock! Shock! Shock!)
Check my shit out on me
Give me a lobotomy
(Shock! Shock! Shock!)
Check my shit out on me
Give me a lobotomy

[Violent J]
I ran outside and tried to stop a Seville
But they just laughed and almost killed me
My face is bloody and my shoes are gone
Standing in traffic, what went wrong?
In my hand is an axe, weapon
Can't relax 'till I know what happened
How did I get to this location
Who the fuck am I chasing?
Or are they in persuit of me?
Either or, I choose to flee
Runnin' on the sidewalk, spazmatic
Shirt's all bloody, no, can't have it
Peel it off, I run inside
Somebody's house, I come to hide
Some kid playing his Xbox, SCREAM, and I'm still in shock

[Hook: Shaggy 2 Dope & Violent J]
(Shock! Shock! Shock!)
Check my shit out on me, Give me a lobotomy
There's no escape from my own head, it's so fucked up
Check my shit out on me, Give me a lobotomy

[Violent J]
I jumped the kid with his power cord, but he got away, oh lord
I ran upstairs behind the mirror
I'm looking for dope, it's clear
I found some klonopin and downed the rest, about 10
Back outside, fat and bloody
Running from or looking for somebody
It don't matter, my brain's shattered
Swinging my axe like "hey batter!"
The sun beating on my face, I hear the police pick up my pace
Into a strip mall, CVS
Huntin' for dope, PBS
He seen me coming and shut the gate
I ain't got time to fucking wait
I'm in shock

[Hook: Shaggy 2 Dope & *Violent J*]
(Shock! Shock! Shock!)
Check my shit out on me, Give me a lobotomy
There's no escape from my own head, it's so fucked up
Check my shit out on me, Give me a lobotomy

[Violent J]
Out the back entrance I cut
Them klonopins are catching up
I tried to hop up over a wall
Backwards, back down I fall
I wanna pass out, but that can't happen
Keep running myself, I'm slapping
I'm getting dizzy, glass in the road
I stepped in it, it took its toll
I hopped the fence onto the grass
2 backyards, looking through the glass
People watching television
They be like "Damn, Yes I'm wishing"
How I got here? Ain't got a clue
I laid on the lawn for a minute or 2
To catch my breath, just for a spell
Everything's fine, All is well...
