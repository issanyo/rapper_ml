[Jeff:]
I'm a master of this shit, Dawn!
I guarantee you I can jump from this roof right here
And make it to that roof, no problem!

[Dawn:]
I don't know, Jeff. That's a pretty big guarantee
If you don't make it, you're definitely dead!

[Jeff:]
But I will make it, this shit is easy!
It don't even look that far!

[Dawn:]
It looks crazy far, man!
Don't even play like that, seriously!

[Jeff:]
Hold my chips, babe

[Dawn:]
Jeff, don't do it, okay?

[Jeff:]
Watch me fly, bitch!

[Dawn:]
Hell no!
Please, don't!
Don't do it Jeff!
C'mon seriously, no!
Uhh!

*Thud*
[Jeff:]
