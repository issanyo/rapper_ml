(Mr. Spade)
Soopa Villainz, Soopa Nova, Notice Saint
Jehovah Witness even recognize when it's over
Mr. Spade the flamethrowa
Deadly spit venom, like a black mamba cobra
Ninja Skills give me incredible stealth
Immortal health, Impeccable wealth
It's ova
I pushed the button the Government said they'd save you
I laughed cause I know they wasn't
Ain't nobody left to kill we murdered everybody
Soopa Villainz new political party
It's O V E R
Ride you to death like Yee Haw
Pandemonium, I'm at the Podium
Hit em with the shade, fade to black my holdin em
Dead bodies, foldin em, Mentally moldin em
Mr. Diamond hit em with the Shing! Ice coldin em

(Chorus)
Ain't no reason to respond it's over!
(It's Over!)
Everybody they're all gone it's over!
(It's Over!)
Her
(It's Over!)
Him
(It's Over!)
They
(It's Over!)
Them
(It's Over!)
Over
(Over!)
Over
(Over!)
Over
(Over!)
It's Over
(Over!)

(Mr. Heart)
Kill em off, everybody, noone's alive
Murder em all, every human on earth die
No trees no fish, no life exist
Burn em up to a crisp, we don't play that shit
Hey, f**k all yall. Soopa Villainz the shit
Mr. Heart f**kin bitches with the villainous dick
It's ova, I dont see any Heroez
Where they at? I could do this with my eyes closed
F**k Earth! We don't care about shit
Send a missile. f**k that Yall hit
SV in the Sky. High risk alert
Let it burn till it's nothin but dirt
What you wanna know about Soopa Villainz
(SV!) Look around, you will see the blood spillin
And you next, what the f**k you thought
Niggas bout to get tossed, bout to blow your head off
It's Over!

(Chorus)
Ain't no reason to respond it's over!
(It's Over!)
Everybody they're all gone it's over!
(It's Over!)

(Mr. Diamond)
It's all over, Zero, nothin but dirt
All in a day's work for the Villain expert
No Popular vote, no population
Just land the ship and start wastin
You can see me miles away
Reflect moon beams into laser rays
They extend for days, and cast hologram walls
Leave you burnt up with smoky drawers
V Four corners of death, Villainz box you in
Mr. Club Boombox bass rocks your chin
Shing! Big rings, big diamonds
The sands all Soopa Degrees up in Crime
It's over. No chance for comeback
Sweep this mothaf**ka dusty flat
Fade to black, before it all goes
Sit and wait for the Heroez

(Chorus)
Ain't no reason to respond it's over!
(It's Over!)
Everybody they're all gone it's over!
(It's Over!)
Her
(It's Over!)
Him
(It's Over!)
They
(It's Over!)
Them
(It's Over!)
Over
(Over!)
Over
(Over!)
Over
(Over!)
It's Over
(Over!)

It's Over!

It's Over!
