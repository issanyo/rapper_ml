(Violent J)
So you fell and busted ya ass face first
The longer you're down there the longer shit is passing you by
Get the fuck up
Get wit' it
Dust your fuckin' ass off and get with the program

[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Catastrophes our like potholes in our lifes
We try to dodge them and keep our shit tight
But everybody gets caught in the rain
We curse the heavens but he ain't to blame
Coincidence haunts us time and change
Tragedies don't let us know in advance
No matter what else shit falls in our way
I can promise they'll be a day we'll all be Ok

[Hook: Violent J]
We'll all be ok
We'll all be ok
We'll all be ok
We'll all be ok

In the sun
Or in the rain
One Day
We'll be ok x2

Hey Hey
We'll be ok hey

[Verse 2: Violent J]
We're on the clock but time heals all wounds
Shit will get brighter we can all assume
Storms will come when the ruthless and dark
The sun will return to light up your heart
People ask "why this happen to me?"
Because you're strong you'll laugh again slapping your knee (hahaha)
No matter what else shit falls in our way
I can promise they'll be a day we'll all be ok

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shaggy & J]
A car accident
A house burned down
Peep the news
A quick look around
Everybody takes turns getting the bone
When tragedy slaps ya
You ain't alone
We all go through it some more than others
Some don't survive we miss our brothers and sisters
In the wind she whispers
Mrs. Mother's Nature seem like she hates ya
This life ain't easy who said it was
Shit hits the fucking fan just because
The flu don't get ya
And then it does
Shit suddenly (?) ya
Hits the fuzz
Keep living your life
There ain't shit to it
Cause sooner or later we all get through it
Open the shade
Sunshine flies in
Better days
On the horizon

[Hook]
