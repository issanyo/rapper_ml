[Otis]
If it's money that you need, homie you can get it
All you gotta do is a keep a loaded clip and speak with it
In the street with it
Lift him off his fuckin' feet with it
Grab a microphone and preach when it's westside wicked!

[Bonez Dubb]
Gun play, gotta raid the police right in the middle of streets
I'll leave 'em all out deceased, I bring peace
To the ways that we kick it
Killin' off you hoes and tricks, it's been seen in the distance
It's westside wicked!

[Otis]
If it's a bitch that you want, homie you can have her
Just make sure you're ready to stab her and don't ask her for shit!
Just be like, "Which one of y'all bitches is suckin' my dick?!"
When it's westside wicked!

[Bonez Dubb]
Boom goes the bomb when it drops on the west
No room for the wrong cause we take out the rest
Soon, not too long, smoke chokes out the breath
Of all the people below, we're makin' death
This is westside wicked!

[Chorus - 2X]
Wicked - WILD
Wicked - WILD
Wicked, wicked, wicked - WILD

[Bonez Dubb]
From the start to the end, I bend and break them
Leave 'em dead with the quickness
Bitch, this is westside wicked!

All the women and the kids are safe from date-rape
Cause we took out all the motherfuckin' hate
Contemplate a new beginning with your petty little mind
No lie
Got the whole world ready to die
We be the westside wicked!

[Otis]
If you're outta control and you like to fight
And your number one wish in life is to die
You can have that -
All you really gotta do is get loud with my crew
And we'll show you westside wicked!

[Bonez Dubb]
If you got this shit on lock
Peel the gat back and cock that bitch, pack it tight with the itch
And let me know if you need to roll on them hoes
Then the family will drop them foes
They be the westside wicked!

[Otis]
If you love to see fire all through the night
And you wanna shoot a pig right off his cop bike
If you wanna smoke the phattest bag of some get-right
Sit tight. I'll be back, I'm gettin' westside wicked!

[Chorus - 2X]
Wicked - WILD
Wicked - WILD
Wicked, wicked, wicked - WILD

[Bonez Dubb]
From the start to the end, I bend and break them
Leave 'em dead with the quickness
Bitch, this is westside wicked!

[Bridge]
[Otis]  Everybody from the westside, aim your strap (aim it up)
[Bonez] Lace up your chucks and grab that indo sack. (smoke it up)
[Otis]  Keep your khaki's creased, dickies buttoned to the top (to the top)
[Bonez] Pull out your axe-tatt and let them murder-braids rock (just let 'em rock)
[Otis]  And it's a 2-1-1, keep a missile in your pistol (keep it loaded)
[Bonez] And you can get a zip for the price of a nickel (real easy)
[Otis]  And if the 5-0's comin' ain't no runnin' just whistle
FOUR FINGERS IN THE AIR, TWO TWISTED IN THE MIDDLE!

[Chorus - 6X]
Wicked - WILD
Wicked - WILD
Wicked, wicked, wicked - WILD

[Bonez Dubb]
From the start to the end, I bend and break them
Leave 'em dead with the quickness
Bitch, this is westside wicked!

WEST SIIIIIDE!
