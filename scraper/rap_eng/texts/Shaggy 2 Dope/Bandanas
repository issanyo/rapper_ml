Ryders Doing the bandana song
Some blue some black some white some red
We take all these motha fuccas down
Some blue some blacc some white some red
We get all this shit done in one sweep
At at man what's that you claim
I'm a low down Rider I ain new ta da game
Got a blue bandana round mah knecc nd da chain
Always stay strapped always ready to bang
Got the whole interior of my ride gang laced
I got the windows rolled down but I'm posted to _____
So everybody know where I'm at
Bandana on my face one tied around the gat

Bandana on my face to conceal my identity
One on my waist to show my family
Riders young loc stas and a dirty ass nigga
Grippin tight to my holsta
My favorite rag lemme tell you what i do with this
Strict lethal wiping off them finger prints
Cause i squeeze an a.k gonna spray
Anyone who stay gunna leave a d.o.a

Some blue some black some white some red
Riders wear rags till they dead they dead
Bandannas blown in the breeze come on
Bandannas hangin on the side of the chrome
Some blue some black some white some red
Riders wear rags till they dead they dead
Bandannas blown in the breeze come on
Bandannas hangin on the side of the chrome

Red black blue green it dont really matter
When i step out the crib i be wearin a bandanna
One tied around my head, one hanging out my pocket
Its a automatic death sentence if you fuckin drop it
Dont get fucked up ? thuggin with a thug rag
End up toe tagged loaded in a body bag
Dis real shit, g's die for these squares
Come disrespect my colors, find your ass in the cross hairs
