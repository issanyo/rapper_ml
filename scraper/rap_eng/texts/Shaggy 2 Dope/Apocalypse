[Intro]
Murderers, day in and day out!
Murderers in this town right now would blow your brains out for enough money for a fix of crack cocaine!
It's never crossed their murdering minds that they're gonna burn in hell!
They've never thought the fact they're going to burn one day!

[Verse 1: Violent J]
The cops have left their posts
And ran home to their wives
Today is the last day of all of our lives
There's bullets in the air
I can hear glasses breakin
There's no mistaking
The fucking earth is quaking
A man is on fire, running down my block
I put him out his misery and blast him with a rock
Explosions going off, sirens and alarms
I'm ready for death, grippin' my hatchetman charm

[Hook]
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
The world as we know it
Say goodbye to the world

Apocalypse
Armageddon came now
Say goodbye to the world
The world as we know it
Let the fire
Let it rain down

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Water mains blow up and shoot out the dirt
A stranger punch me in the mouth, but it ain't even hurt
I'm seeing families run only to be gunned down
By some psychopathic killer with automatic rounds
A burning chopper crashed into the house next door
The pilot got shot, I fuckin' shot him some more
It's mass mayhem, pandemonium, and armageddon
People are killing each other, themselves, and raping neden

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Swarms of insects are attacting the city
I see a man fucking a headless corpse when it hit me
This is Babylon the devil is alive on earth
I pulled the clip in my Uzi and killed for all it's worth

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I shot an old man on his bike
A clown on his trike
A fuckin whore named Sally
And a priest named Mike
They're all dead now
I put gun to my head, too late
A little kid shot me instead

[Hook]
