[Intro:]
{Chris Brown, Violent J:}
I just wanna thank first and foremost all the fans (Yeah, muthafucka!)
That supported me from day one
Um, my label (Stay right there!)
God, brothers, sisters, family members, definitely everybody that's here

[Verse 1:]
{Violent J:}
I drove all the way from Detroit, back seat full of weapons
If I'da got pulled over they'd be dead in seconds
Whipped out a hitch, I arrive on the 405
The Staple Center, tonight it's the Grammys... live
Don't got no ticket, but I ain't here to scream and applaud
I come to kill Chris Brown and shock this industry crowd
Fuck him dead in his seat, blow his guts out his tux
He beat the hell out his woman and they still on his nuts
The fuckin message that is sendin must have a bloody endin
Posin as security, but he ain't safe I'm just pretendin
Bruno Mars on stage, cameras live, TV
That bitch forgave him, but still he's gotta die to me
Big record companies, executives, VIP's watchin
Probly cover up his dead hookers, big business appallin
But the underground below don't approve him, so he flex
He had his chance on top, he fucked it up, make room for the next
He stood up to applaud the show put on by Lady Gaga
Blew a cyanide dart into his throat like, 'got'cha!'
He fell back dead, stuck smilin, eyes open as the night went
They thought he was just dazed, happy from all the excitement
BUT I KILLED HIM!!

[Hook:]
What if I shot a star out the sky? (Shooting stars!)
A piggy has to have wings, before he can fly!
What if I killed him?
What if I shot a star out the sky? (Shooting stars!)
A piggy has to have wings, before he can fly!
I fuckin killed him!
What if I shot a star out the sky? (Shooting stars!)
A piggy has to have wings, before he can fly!
What if I killed him?
What if I shot a star out the sky? (Shooting stars!)
A piggy has to have wings, before he can fly!
