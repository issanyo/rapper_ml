YOUR LIFE - SHAGGY 2 DOPE

Your karma... Its all about karma... (x2, then another x2 in background of next line)

Your life, your life, your liiiii...i-iiii...i-ife

VERSE 1
I awake, floatin 3 feet off my bed
An old cardboard box, no shoes, no socks
But lots of karma, i'm smiley-whilin
Giddy-as-f**k, though grimey-stylin
I gots no home, I gots no bones
Just happy to be alive and checkin payphones
For a quarter over here, a nickel over there
Flat broke, but I got alot of karma to share

CHORUS
I can make mountains get up and move out my way
Hear that paradise has offered me a place to stay
I dont waste a day, I dont starve for nothing
Im the karma millionaire, always happy 'bout something
I say live out your days coz you ain't gettin shit back
Bitch around me will only get you your lip smacked
Karma over any drug dealers supply
Coz I can do anything with it except die

VERSE 2
The bail man's tryin to find me, i'm deep into thoughts
And I bounce everytime a car passes with the bumps
Im the hobo with all the jokes to tell
Full of karma through the roof and i'm broke as hell
Whether the life slows down, or if it throws down
I'm beaming karma and i'm glad to be around
This city get cold as ice, i'm out there
But my karma keep me warm like some thermal underwear

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT "Your Life..." x2

VERSE 3
Let me see a bad weather, I got sunshine for ya
Front me with that sad shit, I'll f**kin ignore ya
My days are always fly days
I like everybody else on them over-crowded highways
I says karma's worth more than money or love
Or any of the above
Mine blows off, and shows off my charisma
Happy nobody here that say that there is none

REPEAT CHORUS

REPEAT "Your Life..." x2

BRIDGE
I'm all about karma, if i'm about something, }
Ain't nobody placed on this earth for nothin, } X
Watch me get to it, get on it, get live, } 8
But i'm still alive, and i'm so alive. }

REPEAT "Your Life..." x4 in background of last 4 times
