See It's A Big Ass Difference
From The Way I Roll
To The Way You Be Doing Things Your Whole Plan Smells Booty Hole
Got Ahead And Get Your False Eye Go Ahead And Pop Your Cris
I Be Waiting For Your Bitch Ass Behind The Club Sipping Old English
It's Somthing About You Mother Fuckers I Just Can't Stand
Gotta Push It Between Your Butt Cheeks But Still Call Yourself A Man
OH NO!
You Need Your Stylist You Broke Your Little Nail

And Your Hair Fell Out Of Place When You Had The Little Face Spell
Fuck That
I'll Drag My Knuckles On Concrete just To Prepare
For The Moment I See You
Which I Am gonna Blow Off Your Beard
Ski Mask Strapped On Tight
Now Days That How You Gotta Do
Cause punk Fucks Like You Get A Black Eye And Wanna Sue
But Me
Yo' Fuck It
I Keep It Old School And Dirty
I Keep My People Happy
And That's All The Concerns Me
So Go On And Keep Hating Bitch We Sick Of Your Bullshit
It's About Time Us Scrubs Shine
I Know Juggalos Are Feeling It

(Chorus)(2x)
Keep It Scrubbin'
Take The Underground Up To The Main Stage
Turn A Ho's Shit Around Till' We All Get Paid
Keep It Scrubbin, Scrubbin
Get It Bubbalin'
Get The Fuck Out My Way
A Scrub Is Steppin' In

I'm a Scrubby, She's A Scrubby, Won't You Like To Be A Scrubby

Getcha Awards
Say Ya Speech Betta' Make It Count
Its Gonna Be The Last Time Words Ever Come Out Your Mouth
I'll Be Up In The Balcony With A Blow Gun And Poisonous Darts
Like A Silent Assassin
A Ninja Of Sorts
While Your Up In Your Choreography practice with your glittery pants
You'll Here My Outside With A Gang Of Scrubs Starting Juggalo Chants
And When You Come Outside Bitch, Don't Get It Confused
It's Me In The Passenger Side Of My Homeboys Ride Spittin' On You
I Remain A Hulkamaniac,
Ain't Afraid To Spend Food Stamps,
Give A Fuck What A Bitch Look Like As Long As She Givin' Up That Ass
And Still Grip My Bucket
With Out A Second Thought
Sport The Same Drawers For A Week With Out Taking Em' Off
And Don't Think For A Second I'm Scared of Getting These Hands Dirty
Cause Your Hands Look Just Right Cause You Ain't My Hands Are Sturdy
So Sooner Or Later Your World And Mine Will Be Colliding
And As Scrubby As It May Seem I'll Always Be Psychopathic Riding

(Chorus)(2x)

Now Days, I Just Don't Know This Shits Out Of Control
Then Ain't It Cool To Be A Fag With Gay Shit Up In The Videos
But Fuck All That I'll Bring It Back Down To A Scrubs Level
Even If I Smell A Fruit I'll Beat It Down With A Rusty Shovel
Preppy Mother Fuckas Roll Around In They Little Benzes,
I'll Be That Freeway Sniper With Them Telescope Lenses
These Dickheads Poking About In The World May Not Like What They Find
Then This Scrub Right Here Don't Mind Sometimes Getting A Little Columbine,

(Chorus)(2x)

I'mma Scrubby, She's A Scrubby, Won't You Like To Be A Scrubby To...
