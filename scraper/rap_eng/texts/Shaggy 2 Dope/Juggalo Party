[Verse 1: Violent J]
I woke up to the feelin' of gettin' my dick sucked
She got up took a shower and hooked me up
And said goodbye and didn't even kiss my cheek
She was polite as fuck cause on her lips was skeet
I got dressed walked out on the lawn it's going on
Block party bitches twerkin' under the sun
Mailman backflippin' does the splits when he land
Hands me a couple checks for $800,000
I slap him a high five then I'm off to get live
Two Bentley's two Bugatti's which one do I drive
My favorite song came on woo I turn up the beat
All my people quick to follow convoy in the street
It's juggalos behind me up front and on the side
Hangin' out the windows sprayin' Faygo as we ride
Clark Park is my target as soon as I park it
Homie hands me a bliggidy my hottie she spark it

[Chorus]
There's a party tonight
Let's do the damn thing
Everybody's gettin' live
Let's do the damn thing
We all feel so alive
Let's do the damn thing
Like we can't ever die
Let's do the damn thing
It's a Juggalo Party tonight
Whoop Whoop
Come on let's get it
Come on let's get it
Let's do the damn thing
Whoop Whoop
Come on let's get it
Come on let's get it
Let's do the damn thing
Whoop Whoop
Come on let's get it
Come on let's get it
Let's do the damn thing
Whoop Whoop
Come on let's get it
Let's go

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Before long it's a mini Gathering at Clark Park
Fuckin' a hottie in a sleeping bag in the dark park
Behind a tree priests droppin' off kegs of beer
Mike E. Clark, AMB, the homie Legz is here
They set a ring up lucha libre it's jumpin' off
Ain't nobody alone they all humpin' somethin' soft
Sing along with Zug Izland playin' an acoustic set
Everybody's gettin' liver than they use to get
This is somethin' brand new take it to another level
Everybody bum rush we all stompin' the devil
This is too much fun I'm fuckin' blew back some
I crack beezlebubs head with the butt of my gun
Cops are havin' a ball shit they all gettin' naked
Bustin' shots and screamin' fuck the law let's break it
Everybody back to my house so the shit don't end
Bright and early tomorrow we fuckin' do it again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
The Marvelous Missing Link has been Found
Take flight you can leave the ground
The Marvelous Missing Link has been Found
You're fuckin' shinin' just look around
The Marvelous Missing Link has been Found
You can see every sight you can hear every sound
The Marvelous Missing Link has been Found
You're free to fly nothing's holding you down
