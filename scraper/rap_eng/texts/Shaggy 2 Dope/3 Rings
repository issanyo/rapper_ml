[Skit]
Phone rings "Hello?"

"You have a collect call from, 'Fook oof.' Please answer the following question Yes or No: Will you pay for the call?"

[Intro: Ringmaster]
"Is this on?
Gather 'round my wealthy friends
And endure the horrifying sights
Only your worst nightmares can produce
Actual human beings of a deformed nature
Come at once
And come and indulge yourself
In our own twisted amusement of
Another's misfortune
Yes, ladies and gentlemen
Enter our three ring show of freaks"

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Ring one, a dung a dung dung
My name's Violent J and I staple my tongue
To the desk in school then I run down the hall
Scaring the shit out of all y'all, bitches
Which is fine, you don't invite mine to your party
Just cause I don't look like everybody
I guess you're bunch of rich boys, bitch boys
Scary, brrrahhhh!
And what's the big deal about my neck
Just because now and then I like to let it stretch
Up a couple feet to get a better sight
Is that any reason to scream and run in fright
No, so, now how ya gon' act?
So what if I got another arm growing out of my back
I guess I'm just another freak show thing
And now they got me in the three ri-i-i-ing

[Hook:]
Three ring a ding a ding ding
People love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding
It's the same as everywhere
[x2]

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Ring two, how do you do?
I'm Shaggy 2 Dope, chicken-faced bitch (Who?)
You, don't try to front ho
Try to play me out just cause I'm running with the sideshow
So maybe it's the leg growing out my neck
But don't jet baby, heh, not yet
Popped out the neden like a pound of lead
Doctor blew his back swole' and dropped me on my head
Oh shit, I knew It had to fuck up my circuits
'Cause when I was two my momma left me at the circus
Abandoned at the carnival with the freak shows
Like bat boy, hermaphrodites and old man crow
But then I escaped to the ghetto zone
Started a crew of my own, motherfucker, I'm not alone!
So don't be stickin your finger in my face stank
Or your stomach might receive a shank from the three ring...
Freak

[Hook:]
Three ring a ding a ding ding
People love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding
It's the same as everywhere
[x2]

[Bridge: Ringmaster]
"I certainly hope you're enjoy yourselves
Here at our three ring exhibit
But to be honest I really don't see
What's so fuckin' funny about it
These fucking people are real!"

[Verse 3:]
[Both:]
Ring three, the ICP
Look if you want but I wouldn't lay a hand on me
That's how you get fucked up
We'll squeeze your windpipe shut
[Violent J:]
Yo, I'm a nerd word, I drink Thunderbird
Half Snake woman kicked my love to the curb
She busted into my tent, now I'm fucked
Had the fat bearded lady in the buck, uh!
[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Fuck that, bitch, suck that
I was born with a wang but I never had a nut sack
It's two balls hanging with no protection so
I move real careful and slow
[Violent J:]
You can call me a weirdo, call me a freak
Call me Don Knotts cuz I'm gettin' knotted every week, uh
So come see the carnival and throw me your change, bitch
I chill with the three rings

[Hook:]
Three ring a ding a ding ding
People love to point and stare
Three ring a ding a ding ding
It's the same as everywhere
[x2]

[Outro: Ringmaster]
"Well, that's it
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you had a good time
You fuckin' heartless bastards
You saw what you wanted
So grab your fucking kids
And that fat flop of shit wife of yours
And get the fuck out of our circus tent
You cold-hearted sons of bitches
You think they look fucked up?
Just wait till I kick your
Fuckin' lips in a couple times
You'll be sittin' up here like a bitch
And we'll laughin' at your folded ass
They'll call you lumpy
After I'm done puttin' knots
All over your fuckin' forehead
Yeah, hey, hey little boy, come here
How'd you like it if I tied your neck in a knot
You fucking little bitch
Come here, I'll shove that
Fucking corn dog up your ass
Get the fuck out of here
Show's fucking over"
Get the fuck out of here!
You fucking heartless bastards!"
