[Intro:]
Time, time, time, time, time, time, time
X2

[Verse 1:]
This life is incredible, a gift from above
But only one thing will last; true love
Time is a beast, it's always breathing
For every morning will have its evening
Time will change everything around you
Time will take away whatever you're bound to
You and your homies enjoying the years
Soon enough everybody disappears
And then new friends will come and go as well
How long will they last? Only time will tell
You might keep a few, but you will grow distant
Look back and it all flew by in an instant
Brand new cars grow old and rusty
Towns abandoned, decayed and dusty
Time, time is a truth, God, believe it
It all becomes a memory once you achieve it

[Chorus:]
And we say
Time's like an endless road, I know
Where will this road lead me?
Time keeps ticking
Time's like an endless road, I know
Where will this road lead me?

[Verse 2:]
This song is scary but we speak the truth
You can only be new once; that's my proof
Beautiful girls grow withered and wired
Rookies on the job all become retired
A family man who truly loves his life
With three little kids and a loving wife
Better enjoy it now, because time is strong
The kids will grow up, it won't be long
And they'll lead the home, just like you did
Start a family and have they own kids
You can be the coolest dude, getting laid
And one day, be alone, lonely and afraid
In the home tucked away so we don't see 'em
If we live that long, one day we'll be 'em
Time don't slow down, the speed is pace
You can see the time sinking into your face

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Time is a monster, bigger than anything
Time will bring down rulers and kings
Time will knock down buildings once new
Time will destroy all of us and you
Even newborn babies, their clock is tickin'
We all have a time limit we were given
Make the best of time, and leave your legacy
And live on in your family's memories
Hope there's an afterlife with all you got
And enjoy it all while we're on the clock
Love your kids, and love your parents
As the world spins on, we just make an appearance
So make it happen, make that shit count
Have faith and believe by the time you're out
What else can you really do with time
Except love life, because the world's divine

[Chorus, repeating]

Once we're gone, the world spins on
Another day with another dawn
Pray there's an afterlife to gain
And enjoy your time while it all remains

[Repeating until the song fades out]
