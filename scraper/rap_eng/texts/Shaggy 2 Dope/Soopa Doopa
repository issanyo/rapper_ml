[Verse 1]
I'm used to drivin' Benz's and Porche's and Corvette's
You might see me in LA on Sunset
Or in Nevada bettin', three-digit degrees not sweatin'
Wearin' leather super fly, light as a feather
Esham, Louis Vuitton, guns like Megatron
Won't stop my reign on the world til Armeggedon come
Underground phenemenon, I wrote the Necronomicon
You's an autobot, I'm a decepticon
Never steppin' without my weapon son
The Smith-N-Wesson teach you a lesson son
In the blackout I was gone and knowin' where the pressures on
Don't sleep till dawn, all those who doze wake up with your shit gone
Emergency, emergency, Dr. Evil, brain surgery
Go to court in the trial took the stand, commited purgery
Kavorkian, King of the scorpion killed 'em all
But some still choose to plot on my downfall
I'm a mo-onster, I'm a co-onquer
Suicidalist, murder be my sponser
How you gonna reason with a psycho
I might go "blaow" when the gat sparks glow like tyco

[Hook]
Kill all heros (Kill all heros)
Easily (Easily)
Who is Soopa Villainz? (Who is Soopa Villainz?)

[Verse 2]
I'm used to havin' money and product and narcotics
Bitches on my dick, still beggin' me for dollars
Holler holler if you heard me, from Detroit to the Dirty
We fly like a birdy, hummers spinnin' thirties
Tony montana, Esham bandana
Body-snatcher, runnin' through your mind like scanners
Original murder planners, the villains they never ran us
I do it "Like A Pimp" like Little Flip and David Banner
Supersonic, byonic, electronic to smokin' chronic
Fuck the world, as I twirl as I sip another tonic
Super wicked shit I spit, I make my victim wanna vomit
SOOPA DOOPA!
Super labratory, spittin' on a super microphone
Super stretch limo pick me up to take me to the Superdome
I'm a Soopa Villain, holdin' on the soopa chrome
Fuck with me and get your brains blown hoes!
