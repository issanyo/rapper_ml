Innocent... folks
Innocent... folks
Folks...
Innocent... folks
Innocent... folks
Folks...

[Violent J]
Innocent folks wrong place at the wrong time
Doing bids or drawn in a chalk line, little kids crossing the bridge too
Young
Some tortured before they come, (damn)
Evil is here, the boogie man too
You don't own a gun, man you should plan to
Am I looking at shit negatively
Crib death mom ain't got shit left
How the fuck is shit fair out here
Homeless family froze on the stairs, where's God bumping his ipod
It's odd, I'll be the lightning rod
I wanna know

[Hook]
Where's God? (we don't know that)
Where's God?
Where's God, when shit goes down? (I wanna know)
Where's God? (we don't know that)
Where's God?
Where's God, when shit goes down? (it ain't right)

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Are we all be tested fail me then
So much fucked up shit where to begin
Some kids are born with a silver spoon
Others born with a needle & a world of doom
Little girl found duct taped and raped
And the killer escaped God give me a break
I want to keep believing but it's a struggle
Let Jake & jack jeckel juggle
Drunk drivers killing Iraq survivors, he can't interfere, then why's he
Here?
After years of feeling like nobody cares
Most of us switch gears on him
Cheers


[Hook]

[Violent J]
Church on fire, everybody dies
As a preacher explains & I roll my eyes
This game tryin' to make sense of madness
For a ray of hope in a world of sadness
I get it, we all need hope to cope
But collection plate money goes to dope
I cling by a finger & I'll admit it
Most of it is bullshit, & I don't get it
If he was up there chillin'
Lettin' this happen
Doin' nothin'
He'd be in need of a slappin'
But we're all clueless to how it works
There are no experts & that's what hurts

[Hook]

[Pastor or priest talking]
"there's not an individual who's ever confessed Christ, who has not but
One time or another, said the wrong thing, thought the wrong thing, done
The wrong thing, & I don't care how saved you are"

[Hook]

[Outro]
I still believe...

It ain't right
Pitiful that
We need him here
It ain't right
