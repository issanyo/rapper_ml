Voodoo, runnin' from my magic

[Hook]
Brain insane, shugga wugga bah
Southwest voodoo's in the house!
Wicked voodoo, joker killer
Magic, dark magic

[Violent J]
Met this kid named Louie Lou
He thought he could fuck with this voodoo
So I turned his head into a lima bean
And then flicked it off his shoulders

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
From Mookan House to Shangri-La
Egyptian Pharaoh, coompata
Follow me, and join us as we pray
To the seventeen moons of Coonga Delray

[Violent J]
Walked in the lunchroom chantin' spells
With bamboo bitches and voodoo bells
Got my own food, who wants some?
I got possum nipples and raccoon tongue

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
A non-believer once started to laugh
So I launched a fireball up his punk-ass
Then everybody heard him squeal
"This voodoo shit's for real!"
It just takes...

A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo

[Hook (x2)]

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Crypt on Verner on a windy night
You see voodoo scribblings in the moonlight
Painted all on the city street
It's the ancient craft of gang bangin

Hey! J! What's in the bag?

[Violent J]
A shrunken head, and shriveled scrotum sack
Why? Ya think voodoo's fake?
Come to the graveyard, I'll make the dead wake

"Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba
Sleep no longer, raise, quick
Raise, raise, shooga-boom ba
Leave us alone, you fuckin' punk bitch!"

Well, fuck it, I ain't that good yet
But one day you can bet I'm a freak
We'll make the whole world dance with the dead
And just like my homey said
It only takes...

A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo!

[Hook (x2)]

Voodoo running from my magic (3x)
I'll make a voodoo doll out of ya and flick your nuts

(x2)
A head from a newt, a wing from a bat
A tongue from a snake, a tail from a rat
A neck from a chicken, an eye from a crow
And a little itty bitty little drip of Faygo

[Hook (x2)]
