[Intro]
Heeheeheeheeheeheeheehee...
Everyone come see the greatest show
Gather up all Juggalos and roll
Everyone come see the greatest show
Gather up all juggalos and roll

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Ah yeah! Dum Diddy Dum
Get your ass out the way cause here we come
And we's bringin' this spectacle into ya town
We got creep shows, freak shows (Wicked Clowns)
Most people don't like these Oddities
Most people would love to have a shot at these
If you think you too good for us sideshow freaks, let me know
And I'm gonna whip smack your cheeks! Come on...

Chorus x2:
Everyone come see the greatest show
(Unlike anything that you know)
Come and be down wit the clowns
(The big Oddity freak show's in town)

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope (Violent J)]
I'm a sideshow looney, watch me get nuts
I do backflips out in fronta mad trucks
And in high school the chicks always gave us props
Cause I was nine feet tall, and my boy's a cyclops
(I can swim shark-filled waters!)
Yeah, well I can chew nails up and spit out quarters
Go cryin for your daddy, what's that gonna do?
When he's just as shook as you, you little shit

Chorus x2:

Everyone come see the greatest show
Gather up all Juggalos and roll
Everyone come see the greatest show
Gather up all Juggalos and roll...

[Verse 3: Violent J (Shaggy 2 Dope]
Where you goin' richy boy?
(What's the matter son?)
Just because we're a little different, you gotta run?
I'm an Oddity
You're lookin' odd at me
But then I gotta be
(And there's a lotta me)
We's a little bit twisted, I gladly admit it
I can unscrew my head off, and shoot hoop with it
(And you can't, so you gotta label us weird)
Even though your mama's got a beard. What!

(Chorus until end)
