I had my face paint on when it all went down
82 Chevrolet crawlin' round
Made a left turn swerve to the right
Lookin in the mirror blue lights
Stop my car what the fuck I do?
I finished my brew and said fuck you
He got all upset and pulled his gun out
I hate cops wouldn't mind takin' one out
He's pattin' me down, I put him in a headlock
DDT'ed him on the sidewalk
Threw his dead body in the trunk
Went to the party and got crunk
Let the bumps bump. I met a fat chick
We pullin' out, she about to snack on dick
When, again, I'm pulled over
Undercover pig in a dark green Nova

(Chorus)
(Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one
(Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop
(Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one

I'm tryin' to walk a straight line
But I'm blew back
An this bitch cop been knew that
He said he taking me in, I said fuck that
You see dis dick in my hands, she Finn to suck that
And you fuck everything up
With all this bullshit talkin' bout hand cuffs
What the fuck? I kicked him in the nuts
Grabbed his own pistol and blew out his guts
Jumped back in the Chevy and mashed it down
A terrified fat bitch and a wicked clown
We went across town to get a pizza
The whole time duckin' la polic√≠a
It's a beautiful night I must say
This bitch only stay two blocks away
I made a left hand turn from the right lane
And the same shit happened again

(Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one
(Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop
(Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one

License and registration? Please
I stole dis bitch, I ain't even got keys
I got a fuckin' screwdriver in the dash
I pulled it out showed him and stabbed his ass
I peeled off fast as hell. Past two more cop cars
Fuck Jail. We shootin' it out
I thought they told ya
I say fuck you and I ain't pullin' over
Fat chick screamin', I'm all through the trees
Pushin' 85 at least
I lost them both but ran into a road block
And this bitch won't reload the Glock
Pulled a U turn and whipped down a side street
Don't matter; they got me on the high beams
I jumped out of the car while it was rollin'
Ran into the darkness and heard it explodin'

(Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one
(Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop
(Violent J) Over. Pull me over. (Shaggy) I'm the one

(Cop) Wanna tell us what's goin' on here?
Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop
(Cop) What do you mean you're just driven' home? You wanna tell us what that smell is? What do I smell there?
