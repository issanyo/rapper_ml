Inner City Posse got the Dog Beats
ICP, we got the Dog Beats

[VIOLENT J]
No you don't stop with the funk from the old days
Start nodding your head as the beat plays
Yo, the ICP has got the Dog Beats
Inner City Posse and we're playing for keeps
And I know that you're liking this funk
Cause I can hear my voice coming out the trunk of your ride
Don't take me for a sucker
You leave it unattended I'm going to take the motherfucker

[2 DOPE]
2 to the D to the O-P-E
Hitting on three with the ICP
I like bass, treble, and the test up
Girl, kick it in the back of a SEMTA bus
With that Forty-O of that strong Bull
Shooting Craps in the back of the liquor store
And I'm hitting, and we'll keep it at that

[VIOLENT J]
You love, Joe?

[2 DOPE]
Nah, I'm 2 Dope for that

[JOHN KICKJAZZ]
Rolling and I'm headed for the Clark Park
Just finished shooting 8 with the Dark Shark
Seen the freak with a bright white tank top
Keep rolling cause I know I'll see my bank drop
Homeboy, if you want to keep your riches
Stay the hell away from them mo' money (censored)
Trucks to the bikes to the Jeeps
The ICP has got the Dog Beats

[HOOK] (consists of numerous samples)

[2 DOPE]
Street lights glaring off the windshield
[???] out of General Wheel
6-pack in the back and [???]
To keep the sounds up, Fosgate 1000

[VIOLENT J]
2 Dope got to keep his own style

[2 DOPE]
Homemade kicker box, four 10-inch Pyles
ICP make the whole car hop
When we let the bass drop

[JOHN KICKJAZZ]
Inner City Posse's got a bad rep
Like my man on the crutches took a big step
And I can't stand the neighborhood menace
So I swell his chin like Rocky Dennis
Bass in the car, something stacked
I know you hear me booming in Pontiac
Everyone's braver when the bass rocks
So I got a little something in the glovebox

[VIOLENT J]
Long black hair with a white rag
40-cent Faygo in a brown bag
Jump Steady, Rude Boy, and Nate The Mack
Chilling by my side cause my posse's stacked
I know I'm getting famous, just think for a minute
Stole a car radio and my tape was in it
Sounds bringing life to the streets
The ICP got the Dog Beats

[HOOK]

Inner City Posse got the Dog Beats (3x)

[JOHN KICKJAZZ]
Waiting at the light as my bass thumps
And I'm getting jocked by these local chumps
They point, they wave, they stare, they look
I've been jocked so hard I could write a book

[VIOLENT J]
Violent J down with the pimp daddies (3x)
Smooth plush rides in a velvet Caddy

[2 DOPE]
All the way live down to Jefferson
Inner City Posse's got the best of them
Will the tape and your system meet
ICP has got the Dog Beats

[HOOK]

Inner City Posse got the Dogbeats
ICP we got the Dog Beats (4x)
