"The wicked clowns and Bushwick Bill are lost in space"

(Violent J)
The car broke down and she was like "Honey, get the flash light"
Still one in the dash right?
Only cause it's late at night
And who knows
What's out there
She was right tho
Ain't gonna help with a light tho
People dying tonight
Cause yo this maniac is, out there
I'm hanging like a possum
Murder tricks, I got some
Spot them
Look come around to the bottom
And slaughter them, out there
His boo was locked up in the car
On the phone and tripping hard
Screaming
F**k that bitch was scurred
There's a killer out there
Cut that crying shit off
I cut
You die
I get off
I'm crawling up on the car
Trying to rip the moon roof lid off, out there
Bitch turned the wipers on
Hazard lights and blew the horn
I smashed with my axe, and pulled her to the lawn, out there
She kicked me hard, to the grill
With one of them, Doc Martin heels
Murderas, you know how that feels
Your lip be out there
Time to die
Close my eyes
Swung and felt a thump
I done spilt her head in half like a tree stump, out there

(Chorus)
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
Lights on in the house
But it's dark outside
You can even close one eye
Look bitch, I'm out there
Camp fire lit
Boy Scout meeting's they talk of me
Even they leaders got memories of me, I'm out there
Forensic scientists try to finger me out
But I'm too quick for their Sheriff's stupid asses
I'm still out there
Pull up all your road blocks
I'm running them them's in my socks
Silently taken out all cops, one by one, I'm out there
Leave they bodies
In the street
Continue on my murder spree
They can believe all my heat
When I pull it out there
Break up into the Zoo
Dress up in a monkey suit
Sticking up families for they loot, my brain, is out there
Handy with an ice pick
Pull it out and use it good
In and out your temple
Blood is squirting all out there
I'm the urban legend you heard at your college dorm
Jump out and squeeze your vocal cords
When you out there

(Chorus)
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing

(Bushwick Bill)
Some where out there a remnance of Bushwick
My mind loads clips at your block
And leave you stuck bitch
A psychopath
With a clasp and a black ski mask
Leave you in body bags
For a news flash
I might be small
But I got big balls
Write my name on the wall
With bloodstains after the brawl
Evil thoughts run deep in my brain
I'm sick and deranged
So picture the pain
Flowing in my veins
Yeah I'm sick
I'm sicker then Hitler
My gat spit streak mothaf**king forbidden scriptures
Niggas run from a gun, forgetting they can't
I drag a Mossberg, cause it won't fit in my pants
I run up in your ride, it's parked and
It's darken
Jump out your glove compartment, sparking
The shit that I do, make many faint
Dead saint
Turn your blood into candy paint

(Chorus)
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what can happen
Don't you dare go out there, ain't no telling what lies out there
Don't you dare go out there, late night killas might be stabbing
