[Verse 1: Anybody Killa]
I can see the Earth start to shift inside out
No trace of the moon since the face burnt out
Watch the rain fall down, hard and heavy
Dark, black, light dirt but it would burn severely
You could call it the body of the Lotus
Hand of the magical super unnatural keepin' you focused
If the rain didn't get you then you're here for a reason
To spread the word to the world that The Pod is in season

[Verse 2: Monoxide]
You can hear the thunder clap, the full moon gleamin'
Like the eyes of a cat, the Dark Lotus is back bitch
And you can feel the ground pulsatin'
And the haters start hatin' but it's all been anticipated
And we've been waitin' till the timing is right
To get bombin' on you bitches who misguided the light
And anybody who don't get it, get the fuck out my sight
Bitch I ain't explainin', I'm just claimin' your life bitch

[Hook]
These black raindrops keep fallin' down
You can tell there's somethin' goin' on, take a look around
These black raindrops keep fallin' down
Arms spreadin' to the Lotus Cross, holdin' it down
These black raindrops keep fallin' down
And I don't know why, why
These black raindrops keep fallin' down
And I may never know why, know why

[Verse 3: Violent J]
I'll stick a runnin' chainsaw blade all down your throat
And fuck it outta your ass, I cut your body in half
I gotta be bloody, need somebody blood on my body
I need to be the bloodiest of bloody buddies and hotties
I'm bout to murder, for, the Lotus
Black rainin', fall, upon us
And I don't need no more threapy, I know who I am
And I don't like it playing through your brain, boo-ya kablam

[Verse 4: Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
I sit alone speakin' with the head of a raven
He sat there and told me why my life's worth savin'
So I shot him in the face then I shot myself
After he said that they're tryin' to turn the kingdom into Hell
I was applled, put his head in my burlap sack
And just then black rain hit me in the back
Ice cold raindrops that look like black blood
Are falling all over the neighborhood, here it comes now

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Jamie Madrox]
A new age, a new time, now that the planets are aligned
Imagine a Lotus sign
Imagine a broken mind's just waitin' to be fixed
With the petals of the Lotus you can answer all that shit
We the unstoppable force of your haters of course
Armed with the fury and the Family is a power source
Wicked red clouds, filled with black rain, sewed up
Until they become too heavy and burst and I show up

[Verse 6: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Maybe your stupid ass ain't heard
It's the Pod little bitch and we back like a message bird
Lift your chin, face to the skies, black rain
Palms out, feel the sting and let your soul get drained
We don't give a fuck, like it or not
Lotus up in the ninjas and all Juggalo spots
I'll put a stain on they little blade pieces
Cause when we out bitch, the black rain increases

[Hook]

[Outro]
How do I know this is part of my real life
How do I know this is part of my real life, real life
