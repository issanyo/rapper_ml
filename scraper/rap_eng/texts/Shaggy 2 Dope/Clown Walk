I Clown Walk jump back with the beat
Breathin with a step and a slap on the cheek
Foot work hear me squat when i walk by
With your hawk eye you get a chalk line
I dance up and down steps when i gotta
Clown walkin on my hands i gotcha
Big love if you love that to
Walkin right past those foos doin the statue

When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
Step forth backwords shotgun let it off

They call me showcase showoff
Sky whisky walks walk like a hawk
Freestyles for the chosin few
For me and my crew only pay per view
Caterpillar or electric boogie
They call me walkwalla crunk when i wookie
So crazy with the ill behavior
Fresh flavor step with the majors

When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
Step forth backwords shotgun let it off
Put your right foot up! Stomp to the ground! Stomp! 180! turn it around!
Put your left foot up! Stomp to the ground! Stomp! 180! turn it around!

Everything im big time super duper
Iv met my homie remy let me introduce ya
Walkin late for squares in fact its deadly
Shed blood on the dance floor i ain't frendly
Boom boom clap let the rhythm proceed
Boom boom clap from the iron in my sleve
4:00 am roll around i had enough
But the tricks still flocked just to brush my shoes off

When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
Step forth backwords shotgun let it off
Put your right foot up! Stomp to the ground! Stomp! 180! turn it around!
Put your left foot up! Stomp to the ground! Stomp! 180! turn it around!
When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
When you do the Clown Walk
Thats how you set it off
Step forth backwords shotgun let it off
Put your right foot up! Stomp to the ground! Stomp! 180! turn it around!
Put your left foot up! Stomp to the ground! Stomp! 180! turn it around!
