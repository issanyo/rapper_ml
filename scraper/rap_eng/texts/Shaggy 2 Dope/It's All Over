[shaggy 2 dope] The end is coming repent now or forever burn the end of the world is here the signs are everywhere its all over!

[Violent J]
Holy fuck it's hot outside, extra hot
The sun is closer then it's ever got
The sky's polluted, it's raining crud
Pandemonium throughout the hood
Every hour the planet shakes
Buildings collapse from the earthquakes
Freeways are packed, horns are blowing
Nobody really knowing where the fuck they're going

Tidal waves swallowing the shores
Coffins pushing up through your floors
It's suddenly freezing, we fall to pieces
Pray for Allah and call to Jesus
Some stay home and hold their wives
Others flip out and end their lives
Me, I climb the roof of my house
Spread my arms out, and sing;

[Hook]
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go) [x2]

[Violent J]
Huh, walking along my path
The city has morphed into a blood bath
Some are looting, others shooting
The devil's in the sky and he's recruiting

Tornados twisting through downtown
Throwing buses and trucks around
It's snowing, hailing, and burning up
I rock my headphones and turn'em up
Folks dying, crying, dead and crawlin
Run to the church, can't fit 'em all in
Watch the groundscape crack in half
A bottomless pit down Gratiot Ave
Some stay home and welcome death
Appreciating each additional breath
Me, I climb the roof of my house
Spread my arms out, and sing;

[Hook]
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go) [x2]

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Fire, Ice, Lava, Winds
Hurricanes, Earthquakes
Taking it all in (wow) [x2]

Acid rain, lighting, sin
Earth shattering
Taking it all in (wow) [x2]

[Violent J]
Boulders fucking fall from the sky
Death with no clue when or why
The sun explodes and we absorb it
Our planet spins right out of orbit
Aliens show up and eat mankind
A virus spreads with no cure to find
God has had enough of our shit
A nuclear war breaks out and that's it

To be on this planet living your life
To see it all end would be alright
You can't complain, you wouldn't die alone
You can die with loved ones and die at home
And you're not missing anything when you're gone
Plus seeing it all end and what goes on
To see this great world come to an end
Would be the next best to seeing it begin

[Hook]
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go) [x2]

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Implosions!
Explosions!
Corrosion!
Burnt up and frozen!
The sky is falling!
The gods are calling!
It's all appalling!
THIS SHIT WE ALLLLL IN!

[Hook]
It's all over! (Here we come and there we go) [x7]
