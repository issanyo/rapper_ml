(God is here) Ahhhhhhhhhh
(God is here) Necronomicon is coming
(God is here) Oooooooooooo!
(God is here) Ahhhhhhhhhh

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Mass Murdera, strangla
Wig Splitta, mangla
Blood suckin' vampire
Dark Lotus king of Fire

(Violent J)
I'll swing off your ceiling fan and jump like an ape
And stomp on your head until it pops like a grape

(Marz)
And now you flatlined 'cuz I shot you face nine times
All you see is bright white lights then you feel your heart stop
Well bro., good as day as any to die, alright
I don't give a mutha fuckin' fuck, buh buh bye bye

(Shaggy 2Dope)
Sittin' on a tree branch like a crow i'll hawk your every move
Droppin' down on mutha fuckas backs and twist they heads like screws

(Violent J)
Fuck your electric chair, I don't care, bring it on bitch!
C'mon, crack an egg on my head, i'll fry you an omelet

(Shaggy 2Dope)
Deep up in the woods naked, I do my fire dance
Around the pit I hop with my skull, drums, and voodoo chants

(Jamie Madrox)
See it'll never take name,it'll never take shape, it'll only mutate
Seen a fetus with a microphone,3 arms, 2 brains, and only one leg (only one leg)

(Violent J)
Shoot me, c'mon, blow a hole in my lung
I'll lick out the hole when I swallow my tongue

(Jamie Madrox)
Left alone in a world where hate and angers the key
You can tell the judge was recreatin' all that shit you see on TV

(Marz)
I feel for the unclean, letter unseen
Need a obscene, make yo ass bleed, to the extreme
What a dream, mean when you wake up screamin'
Wit' a demon, suckin' on your dick, ick, semen

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Bullets percin' through your skull
Plant my fist into your jaw
Retract my hand, release your teeth
Your chicklets fall into the street!

(Shaggy 2Dope)
Pull your eyelids over your head, staple 'em to your skull
Drip bleach into your eyes as I face fuck your girl

[Hook]
This bread I eat, this salt I swear!
As I inflame myself with prayer!
There is no grace, there is no guilt!
This is the law, do what thy will!

(Shaggy 2Dope)
A cup full of chicken blood, 3 shapes of a monkey paw
I'll have you cuttin' through your own arm bone wit' a hacksaw

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Bone's exposed from the skin
Blood drips from innocence
Pullin' lungs up outta chest
Leavin' bodies where they rest

(Marz)
The voices in my head is whisperin', listen "You must kill them"
Hammer to the head yo family gone listen "We aren't your family"

(Jamie Madrox)
When we attack, we attack like a swarm
Punch you through your face, rip off your neck and play my rythm on your vocal chords

(Violent J)
I walk on your ceiling, and drop thread in your mouth
Let poisin drip down it and silently take you out

(Jamie Madrox)
One bee, protectin' the hive, we stay alive
I'm on overdrive, with my axe, will u survive?

(Shaggy 2Dope)
We'll conformulate a plan, reflex come and take control
Dip my hand in broken glass and pull your heart out through you butthole

(Violent J)
My eyeballs are black, my tears drip like oil
I fuck holes in my yard and grow children from soil

(Shaggy 2Dope)
See the eyes of the dead, they come back alive
And wipe the air out your lungs, now I see through your eyes

(Marz)
Cyanide, do the body right, mutha fucka can't hide 'cuz i'm in ya mind
I'm a finnin' to bring da dye, cock back never aim just let it ride

(Violent J)
Scientists study me, but they always quit
Cuz I eat through my butthole and talk nothin' but shit

(Blaze Ya Dead Homie)
Dark Lotus devastation
Murder without no premeditation
Demons from beyond the earth
Creepin' up on out the dirt!

[Hook]

Voice of reason without conception!
Life we follow their deception!
I look at my reflection!
Gods resurrection!

[Hook]
