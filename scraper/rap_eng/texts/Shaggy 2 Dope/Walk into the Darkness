[Violent J]
In the name of the Witch, I cut the head off a mule
I gutted it out, put it on and then I wore it to school
That ain't the only thing I wore, I wore a clip and some rounds
A fuckin' killa with this mule head and I'm clippin' 'em down
Because I'm all out of choices and my voice is unheard
You and your boys get the worst, I aim your forehead and burst
I'm evil, fires in my sky, I see no diamonds it's true
Aim for your guts and blow your breakfast out behind you
I'm one with the darkness...

[Hook]
Walk into the darkness
(A place for those who chose to give a fuck less)
Wicked, dark and heartless
(We keep it nutty and bloody for everybody here)

[Bridge]
I'm goin' to hell
And I'm knowin' it well
And I got no problem showin' it
And goin' to jail

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I see the Witch is preaching every night on channel 13
He wants some money with the number on the screen, I hit the scene
I'm shootin' up somebody's funeral, someone I don't know
My thoughts are fraught with homicide, I fire out of control
The preacher tried to reach his Caddy in his mink white robe
But now he's like a sheep slaughtered on the side of the road
As for that crooked choir, I set that place up on fire
As they came out, batted their heads like I was Mark McGwire
I'm in the darkness...

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm goin' to Hell, and I'm knowin' it well
And I got no problem showin' it and goin' to jail

[Violent J]
Walk 'til you fall into the darkness of Hell
You gettin' raped in Hell, by Satan's tail
And all you bitches with them pussies, believe you gettin' fucked
By a 27 foot dragon while chewin' your face up
It ain't pretty in Hell, and the only light
Be the fire that you squirm in while you burnin' all night
And when the Wraith take you, his grip is hard as a nail
He'll turn your world upside down and make it rain Hell...

[Hook x2]
Walk into the darkness
(He'll turn your world upside down and make it rain Hell)
Wicked, dark and heartless
(He'll turn your world upside down and make it rain Hell)

[Bridge]
I'm goin' to Hell, and I'm knowin' it well
And I got no problem showin' it and goin' to jail
