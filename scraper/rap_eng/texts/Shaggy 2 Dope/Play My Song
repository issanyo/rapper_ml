[Verse 1: Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope]
We hit the ace, ace, ace, and love giving chase
Wicked clowns got more than some pie for your face
With a drip, drip, drip, it's blood on the strip
Three disassembled bodies in the trunk of the whip
Hear the saw, saw, saw, right below your jaw
And see your own head roll off the table and fall
See the puck, puck, puck, flaming arrows in your truck
And one in your lung stuck, you fucked out of luck

[Hook:]
Play my song (give me something I can lean on)
Well what you tryna hear (something about murder, I got that)
Play my song, bloody, bloody, bloody...

[Verse 2: Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope]
Here come the hack, hack, hack, knives in your back
Blood down your spine all in your ass crack
With a swing, swing, swing, your throat's whistling
The three incisions I made are as fine as g strings
It's the pap, pap, pap, from behind with a bat
And splatter every crack till your whole head flat
Beat the jab, jab, jab, I'll punch you in your flab
Drag you to the butcher shop and chop you into slab


[Hook]

[Verse 3: Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope]
Every one of us got to have murder or death
To remind ourselves that we still have our breath
Whether it's tasteful or disgraceful
Shit, as long as everybody get a face full
Some of us root for the coppers, others root for the killing
But everybody needs their murderous thrillings
Trace it back to when mankind was swinging from a tree
Murder's what we talking about and always will be


[Hook]
