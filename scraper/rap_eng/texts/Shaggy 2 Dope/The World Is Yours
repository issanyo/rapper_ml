[Intro:]
You got the whole wide world in your hands
This is what most people don't understand
You get your plan together, put your mind to it
Stand up, brush your shoulders off, and do it
You got the whole wide world in your hands
This is what most people don't understand
You get your plan together, put your mind to it
Stand up, brush your shoulders off, and do it

[Verse 1:]
I know the world’s fucked up in a lotta ways
Shit's gloomy outside a whole lotta days
You never win shit and play a gang of lotteries
Feel like you're always getting the bone, a lot of sodomies
But when you rise above it all
Open your eyes you’ll love it all
Devil tells you lies, you shove 'em all
And realize you're fly with doves and all
You can't have it 'til you take a stab at it
Until you reach for it, you can't grab it
You might realize you ain't bad at it
And if you fall down your ass is padded
This planet's green or blue for you
There's no limit what you can do
Dive off a tower, fly through a Froot Loop
Land posing in a Troop suit like
Whoop whoop!

[Chorus]
You never been up so high
You're living on your own cloud nine
You ain't ever felt so free
Shine bright, let 'em all see
The world is yours
The world is yours

[Verse 2:]
You can have it all it's out there for the takin'
The world is yours like a pig gots bacon
You can be a rock star, homie, I ain't faking
If you think you couldn't pull it off, you're mistaken
You can be a brain surgeon, splurgin' on  bank
You can be a scuba diver, swimming in a fishtank
You can be a fuckin' prisoner, carving out a shank
Alls it takes it nuts and guts to start pulling rank
You can be an astronaut, an ass or not
You can be the kingpin of hash and pot
You can pack a gat and you can blast a lot
You can even run a marathon, fast or not
You can be a cannibal, a vegan, or slob
You can be a cocksucker, go slob a knob
You can be a lazy bum, fuck havin' a job
The world is yours, in or out of the mob

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Don't let 'em call you shit for brains
Even the president's got shit stains
We're just squirrels chasing a nut, tryna get brains
I say the cool kids are legitly lame
At some point, bitch, I will surpass you
On my way to my dreams I’ll be glad to
And you don't have any, so I'll have to
Leave your ass in the dust, too bad, dude
I’m headed straight up out of this stratosphere
You wouldn't know it now but I’m the baddest here
I’m a portrait of art and you a splattered smear
My destiny for you? Too bad, it's here
I found my missing link and I’m incredible
Unstoppable and undebtable
Hit me with the tiger claws, I’m unshreddable
Don't live in the darkness, instead I glow

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
You got the whole wide world in your hands
This is what most people don't understand
You get your plan together, put your mind to it
Stand up, brush your shoulders off, and do it
You got the whole wide world in your hands
This is what most people don't understand
You get your plan together, put your mind to it
Stand up, brush your shoulders off, and do it

[Chorus]
