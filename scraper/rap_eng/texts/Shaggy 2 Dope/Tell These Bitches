[Verse 1]
Shout to my thugs and my scrubs going in for the kill
Mad love for my fam, yeah, keeping it real
Still holding that hatchet up, holding shit down
Terrorizing folks, painted up like a wicked clown
S - H - A double G - Y
Numero Two D - O - P - E
I - stood up to the test of time I know you like "fuck me"
2nd LP between Joker's Cards
ICP for life, love it like a second wife
Murderous beats and wicked lyrics, shits nice
Never think twice never looking back now
Always looking forward and deliver
Believe that
I write my raps and my skin with a sharp blade
With my eyes shut in a cloud of haze
Step up to the mic and recite the chorus
Read it backwards, hit it forward
With demonic twang

Not known to sing but the shit I bring
Get your spine tingling, brain stem to bottom
This ring, what it mean is that I wouldn't hit women
Think, think it again. You (?) me dancing

[Hook]
Shaggy 2 Dope did it again and Imma
Tell these bitches how they life gonna end
Cause they steady frontin' like they just don't know
That you can't fuck with a strangler
Shaggy Shaggs ain't no hoe
(whats good with it?)

[Verse 2]
There's too many damn fish in up in this pond
I'mma gobble em up and drop the fuckin' bomb
Whoa!
Destroy the weak, rule over the strong
And keep these wheels rollin' on and on and on
What's wrong with these mainstream dickheads?
"Down with the feds" you straight up shitheads
Do what you goin' do but we ain't goin nowhere
For 25 years of fear ain't bout to disappear
So FUCK the FUCK off, you motherfucker
Yeah you trick the masses, I ain't drinkin' your Kool-Aid, dude
Devil, Bring it up a level, YAH!
I bring trouble like a Pop-O-Matic bubble, HOT!
It's what you not. Tryin to bring what I got
You're bound to flop, tryin' to stand in my spot
You get stabbed, not shot, where my blade? found it
Less noise, more blood, soak up in your carpet

I wake, did dab, with the liquid that's red
Then it's off with your head
Not sorry for your second
But instead, sliced your body like a loaf of bread
Cause you spit too damn much, and nothin' said

[Hook]

I stab you, (?)
If we got beef
Knock out your teeth you fuckin' dweeb
Bend down now
Pick em up now
Kick you in the ass
What's up now?

I stab you, (?)
If we got beef
Knock out your teeth you fuckin' dweeb
Bend down now
Pick em up now
Kick you in the ass
What's up now?
(What's good with it)
