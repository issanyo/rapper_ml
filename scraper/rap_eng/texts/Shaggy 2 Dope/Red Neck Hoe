[Intro]
"Who's that broad I seen over there in the pumpkin patch yesterday pickin' up pumpkins over yonder yesterday?"

"I don't have no idea, I seen that same girl just-a bendin' over pickin' up them things scratchin' that bad little ass a-hers"

"I'm tellin' you what, I seen her come a-runnin' through the hills, a hootin' a-hollerin' and her titties was floppin', she was finer than peach fuzz ? with a bread axe, brother!"
"I seen..."

[2 Dope]
Rappin' to this bitch with a red neck, a red neck
That fuckin' red neck
Rappin' to this bitch with a red neck
A down south bitch with a red ass neck

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Bitch, you got a red neck
But you look kinda straight so I'm 'bout to step
Heard ya like fuckin' in pig pens
Ya never see boys, so ya fuck your girlfriends
Bitch, I know you's a ho
So lemme fuck you with my big toe
Cause I don't care what them hicks can do
Shit, I can fuck like a chicken hawk too
Bitch, we can take a walk
But I hate the way you fuckin' hillbillies talk
So keep ya filthy ass mouth shut
And don't say shit, nasty slut
Bitch, I wanna hit it
So I can drop your ass in a New York minute
But your quick to act like you didn't know
Like ya didn't know that I'm a gigolo, ya didn't know
Bitch, we can sit on the porch
Swing in the chair, I don't fuckin' care
But then it's to the sack, to the sack we go
I'm finna fuck this red neck ho

[Hook]
Bitch, you's a ho and ho you's a bitch
Everybody know that you's a funky, funky bitch
Bitch, you's a ho and ho you's a bitch
Everybody know that you's a funky bitch

[Interlude: Violent J:]
Rappin' to this bitch with a red neck
A fuckin' red neck, a red ass neck
Rappin' to this bitch with a red neck
Said a mountain top, cornstalk red ass neck

[Verse 2: 2 Dope]
Bitch, it's 2 Dope
Before I throw you this dick, I'll throw you some soap
Cause ya been in a barn all day
Milkin' cows and fuckin' with hay
Bitch if ya let me hit
I don't care, you can play your Wayne Newton shit
I can take a little Conway Twitty
When I'm suckin' on a red neck titty
Bitch, I'll go down south
With a piece of wheat hangin' out my mouth
And sport a funky ass straw hat
But after I hit it - mothafuck that!
Bitch, I'm from the big city
And I'm finna fall asleep on your big titty
Yeah, it's the farmer's daughter
But I ain't gonna fuck in no swamp water
Bitch, drop your overalls
And we can fuck in the back of a horse stall
You're the ugliest bitch I know
But I'll still fuck ya, red neck ho!

[Hook]
Bitch, you's a ho and ho you's a bitch
Everybody know that you's a funky, funky bitch
Bitch, you's a ho and ho you's a bitch
Everybody know that you's a funky bitch

[Verse 3: John Kickjazz]
My rap song can't even hang
With the wicked shit you've done
You go lynchin' with your gang
On a brother or a Mexican (fuck)
This shit may never quit
Bigots may never learn (never learn)
I'll cut your mothafuckin' throat out, bigot!
Now it's your turn (yeah)
Bigots in the north seem to get respect
You know I'll choke that greasy neck
Step to the left, step to the right
Aim my piece and I'll fuck your face up
Bitch, cause I don't sleep
Said, fuck you bitch, I don't sleep
In the south there's a lot of good faces
But shit, I'ma gat on a fuckin' racist

[Violent J:]
Bitch, I can't tell from where I'm at
But it looks like your neck is red - fuck that!
I'm about to step
So I can say I fucked a ho with a red neck

[Hook x9]
Bitch, you's a ho and ho you's a bitch
Everybody know that you's a funky, funky bitch
Bitch, you's a ho and ho you's a bitch
Everybody know that you's a funky bitch
