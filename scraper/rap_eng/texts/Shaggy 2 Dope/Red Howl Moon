[Verse 1: Violent J]
Every so often the blood red moon rises
Which means big surprises
Cats can feel it, they fight with each other
Psychopaths emerge and strangle their mother
People are high without dope in their system
Miscellaneous violence you could list them
The suicide rate on these nights quadruples
Wolves howl with dilated pupils
But these blood red moon nights get worse
When they happen to fall on October 31st
Like tonight I’m a grown man I should be home
Handing out gumballs, but I’m all in the zone
I want to murder somebody with a dull butter knife
I want to run wild and let go of my life
I’m sweatin’, twitchin’, I’ve got to do something soon
Howl at the moon!

[Pre-Hook: Insane Clown Posse]
Tell me, tell me, tell me
Are/So you talking to the moon or something?

[Hook: Insane Clown Posse]
I want to bask and soak it in, all the precious moonlight
Tonight it's bloody red it's got me feelin' alright
On top of that it's halloween, the world is filled up with fright
I wanna reach the highest point so I can howl tonight

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I don’t even like Halloween! Fuck off me!
I ain’t giving out licorice and toffee
But tonight is different, I’m feeling frisky
Kind of like I drank a whole bottle of whiskey
I look in the sky and the moon is bleeding
Got me thinkin’ I’m some kind of heathen
I grabbed the hammer out of my tool box
And slipped out the back door wearing my socks
Under the light of the red moon I hopped some fences
Wearing a Jason mask from Spencer’s
I’m tempted to enter a home and slaughter
Kill this old man and choke his daughter
How do I fight this evil urge?
A red moon Halloween means it’s time to purge
I stand there in a field with the moon above me
And howl because it’s so lovely

[Verse 3: Violent J]
I climb up this house carefully and slow
Once on top I’m under the moon’s glow
I climb the chimney to the highest peak
And howl and try not to shriek

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I climb a tree to its highest branch
The higher I go, the moon advance
I’m on the tippy top next to an owl
Peel out of my shirt and howl

[Verse 5: Violent J]
If I don’t howl blood will spill
I climb this building or I will kill
To the top I stand up on the air duct
Aand start to howl, as off I jump

[Verse 6: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I scale this tower totally naked
The urge to kill, I just can’t shake it
I reach the top, the moon is passing
I start to howl and jump off backwards

[Hook]
