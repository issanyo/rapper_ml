Maggots can't fuck with the Shaggy 'cause I got a crew
Bitch, a crew like you ain't never even known
Carnival freaks from the ghetto zone
All waitin' for the day to put you in your place
I'll have the fat bearded lady sittin' on your face
Bitch boy, bitchy, you might get hurt
Dead Carnival clowns puttin' in w-w-w-work
You think you're the shit 'cause you think you got the upper hand
But won't you come and meet my boy, The Strong Man
And he'll grab you by the head and squeeze it till it pops
And shake your muthafuckin' neck until your head flops
'Cause I'm runnin' with the beyond, ya muthafucks
I'll make a voodoo doll of ya and flick your nuts
See I was born to cause a killa carny ruckus
I came out the neden, stompin' and chokin' muthafuckas
I leave a screwdriver stickin' halfway out your dome
The worst part part about it is, I'm not alone

[Chorus]
Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but ya picked the wrong fight
Ya think you're Jimmy Crackcorn, but they don't care
They bust you in your muthafuckin' head with a chair
Jokers and freaks deep in the night
Thought I was a nerd but ya picked the wrong fight
Ya think you're Jimmy Crackcorn, but they don't care
They bust you in your muthafuckin' head with a chair

I'm a nerd, and all the bitches call me a nerdy geek
And they would love to stick they thumbtacks on my seat
And they would throw they spitballs at the class freak
And everyone of them bitches died in they sleep
'Cause I fuck around with books that the circus barred
Crystal balls, black magic and jokers cards
And at night, just when I'm feelin' lonely
The clowns come to my bed and juggle for me
So don't fuck with the Shaggs 'cause I cast spells
And don't come cryin' to me when your tongue swells
I'm hangin' with freakshows, like Crab Boy
Snake Boy, Flipper and Scab Boy
And a man who can eat his own fuckin' face
And then shit it out and screw it back into place
If ya don't think so, you can suck my bone
'Cause I tried tellin' ya man, I'm not alone

[Chorus]
Jokers and freaks...
Jokers and freaks...

Well, I like to hang with Tall Jess and Jumpsteady
Nate The Mack and Violent J and Uncle Freddy
Chucky Mutha Fucky and Stef they got my respect
But I really like to hang with old Rubberneck
A freakshow from the circus that ya don't know
And I fucked the Lion Lady in the neden hole
And sometimes she do an acrobatic flip on my nuts
And it feels so goooooooood!!!!
So tell your boys that they a yellow bunch of chump suckas
I walk around your neighborhood chokin' muthafuckas
I used to be a fool but now the joker's got juice
Shit changed when I started hangin' out with Zeus
And if you take me out, you know I'm comin' back again
With my homeboys Jack and the Cannon Man
He come flyin' out the barrel doin mach 9
With his fist comin' straight for your spine
Never fuck with the Shaggs 'cause it's always tickin'
I throw a curse and turn your ass into a chicken
So when you see me by my lonely in the ghetto zone
Muthafuck, ya better realize, I'm not alone

[Chorus]

Who's that? Who's there? No!! Stop it!! Ahh!!
Ahhhh, I can't stand it!! Ahh!! Go away!! Leave me
Alone!! No! No!! Ahhh!!!

[Chorus]
