Smell the air that makes you sick
Psycho sick, psycho sick
In due time it gets inside your brain
Psycho sick insane
Who's to blame for what they've done?
Ain't the one, paint the gun
I'm the jugga-lugga-loc-a-roni
Best you leave me alon-ie
Some will say I'm in a gang
Guns do bang, nuts do hang
Like the wicked jokers down river
Quick to cut your liver
Sometimes bangers send they doom
Boom-boom-boom, sha-lock-lock-boom

I like riding on your daughties
Drinking 40's at clown parties
Then, I go back home, the sewer drain
Call me shit for brains

Fuck a bozo I pack a Bobo
Watch me balance on telephone wires
Psycho setting fires
Caught me naked in a tree

Rip and tear ya, cuz how dare ya

Wicked town, wicked clown
Let's go ride the Murder-Go-Round

Beat you with a cinder block
Bitchy hoe, bitchy bitch
Smack you 'cross your fucking lips
Juggla say "talk to much"
I'ma nail your mouth...shut

Swing my axe upside your head
Place the barrel in your mouth
Blow your fucking tonsils out

And your daughter sucks my nuts
Better know joker's wild
