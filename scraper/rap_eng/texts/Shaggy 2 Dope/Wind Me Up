Wind me up
So I can keep up with you
Shits so electric these days
I clash with everything new
I try to fire my guns
I try to bang on my drums

There was a time when I ran
The fastest anyone seen
There was a time in my hands
I had the world it would seem
There was a time I could stand
On top with no in between
There was a time
When I didn't need somebody to
Wind me up

I'm tryin' to race with the best
This once was easily done
It came easy to me
Now there's no to for risk
They do shit faster these days
I know, I'm tryin' to keep up

There was a time when I ran
The fastest of anyone seen
There was a time in my hands
I had the world it would seem
There was a time I could stand

On top with no in between
There was a time
When I didn't need somebody to
Wind me up

I can't let ship pass me by
I'm winded yet still I keep on
I'll never ever never at least try
This world is spinnin' so fast
I'm still on it
Lets see how long I'll last, how long I'll last

There was a time when I ran
The fastest that anyone seen
There was a time in my hands
I had the world it would seem
There was a time I could stand
On top with no in between
There was a time
There was a time I didn't need a wind up [x3]

There was a time
There was a time I didn't need a wind up

There was a time
There was a time I didn't need a

There was a time
