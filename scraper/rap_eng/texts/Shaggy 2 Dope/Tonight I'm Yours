"The Devils all in my business, the Devils tryna' take hold, the Devils tryna' influence me, the Devils chained to my soul, Devils eyes they might watch me and they won't leave me alone, the Devils tryna' influence me, the Devils taking control"

"Hahaha, tonight your mine"

[Verse 1]
Slidin' down a slippery slope into a dark hole
Lost of all her life now my demons are in control
Wake up with blurred vision lost my grip on reality
Walk outside can't tell if its real life or if its on TV
Colours come to life then they blur then they disappear
Then I realize I've been staring at the devil in my mirror
Tussling with myself over Heaven or Hell
I hear it's hard as fuck to fly but easy to repel
And my feet are getting hotter every step that I take
And the sky is getting darker every move that I make
There's an evil in my head and its dripping out my pores
It's calling me and draggin' me down
TONIGHT I'M YOURS!

[Hook]
Devil all in my business
NO!
The Devils tryna' take hold
YES!
The Devils tryna' influence me
NO!
The Devils chained to my soul
YES!
The devils eyes they might watch me
NO!
They won't leave me alone
YES!
The Devils tryna' influence me
NO!
The Devils takin' control
YES!

[Verse 2]
Now this force has to tooken over me
Like I'm a fuckin' puppet
Pullin' on my strings can tell if I hate it or if I love it
Part of me is saying go with ut you'll dig it
And it's all good
The other part of me is saying word up
Knock on wood
My joints they stiffen my blood ice cold
My head is fuckin' knockin' and my hands are in killing mode
My body won't stop shaking
And murder is on my mind
'Bout to take somebody's life first person I find
Lookin' though tunnel vision steady sweatin freezin' hot
Spotted me a bitch and this bitch 'bout to get got
There's an evil in my head and its dripping out my pores
It's calling me and draggin' me down
TONIGHT I'M YOURS!

[Hook]
Devil all in my business

[Verse 3]
I offed a bitch out by her hair
She turned around and tazed me and she knew she fucked up that shit Didn't even faze me
Grabbed the back of her head and pulled it right up close to mine
Started comin' back to my senses just in the nick of time
I let her go she ran off without even puttin' up a fight
It was calling me and draggin me down
BUT NOT TONIGHT!
