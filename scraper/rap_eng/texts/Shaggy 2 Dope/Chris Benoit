Down

[Intro]
A catastrophic demise x7
Unmeasurable regrets x4

[Verse 1: Violent J]
Shit builds up, fills up
Too much goes over board
(What the fuck am I doing?)
Oh lord pressure stored exploded, unloaded
(What the fuck am I doing?)
I had to, it's really too bad, too
(Went coocoo) gone mad dude
Grab at and stab fools
Who knew? Sad news
(What the fuck am I doing?)
I-I-I broke, it took some time
Slow poke
I finally gave way, went under deep
Don't float
No longer steering choosing
An autopilot cruising
Haywire, crash, virus
Pull your tongue out with pliers, CHRIS BENOIT!!

[Hook]
No longer steering, lost all control
Manipulation (Manipulation), it won’t let me go
The pain exploded (The pain exploded)
The pressure burst (The pressure burst)
I drop the wheel (I drop the wheel)
Heading for the worst x5

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Strobelight, let go, hold tight
Wake up to this, closed eyes
You did this, this you
(What the fuck am I doing?)
You got issues
What happened, shit I’m stepping
All bloody myself I’m slapping
One day, all the sudden, it, all became too much, wasn’t it?
Yes, finally released
(What the fuck am I doing?)
Unleash the beast
Eject my controller
(What the fuck am I doing?)
Took me over
I had to, it's really too bad, too
Went coocoo, gone mad dude
Grab at and stab fools
Who knew, sad news, I'm CHRIS BENOIT!!

[Hook]

[Interlude]
I can take you over, permanently
Because life is about pain
I’m the crippler, Chris Benoit!
And waa

A catastrophic demise x7

[Outro]
I’m heading for the worst
(a passion for the regrets)
(The crippler)
Heading for the worst
(a passion for the regrets)
(The crippler)
Heading for the worst
Heading for the worst
The crippler
