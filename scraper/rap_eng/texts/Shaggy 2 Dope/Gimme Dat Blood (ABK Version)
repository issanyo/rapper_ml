Oh what I wouldn't do to taste your blood
HHAHAHAHA
Your blood
HHAHAH
Things that I wouldn't do to taste you blood
Your blood
HHAHAH
Things that I wouldn't to taste

[Anybody Killa:]
I love Blood
The color redmakes me excited
Up to three pints a day and I just can't fight it
Searching for a victim with an open wound
Hang around a hospital for blood to consume
Can't stop and if I could I dont think I would
Warm blood on my tounge just tastes too good
More blood that I drink the more I feel alive
Lotus keeps me clear through the juggalo eyes

[Monoxide Child:]
Cut yourself
Let it bleed
Pulsate
My hear beat pumping like an 8-o-8
A shadow casta
Phantasma
And I wanna take a drink
And get plasma
I'm hanging upside down
In an all black room
Sticking myself
Drinking the blood from the wound
Gotta consume
Enough blood to keep me alive
Cause if I don't
I'm gonna wither and die
Bye bye

[Chorus x2:]
Things that I wouldn't do to taste your blood
HAHAHAHAHA
Gimme that blood, gimme that blood

[Shaggy 2 Dope:]
Now blood might drip
Blood might clot
Blood might flow
But fuck all that
Sit down and listen close to your Uncle Shaggs
I take blood in any form
Even scabs (BLECH)
Tenden needles filled with junkie blood
Just let me find this vein (auauaugh)
I hang at the emergency ward
And lick wounds
Gimme that blood for that ritual of the loons

[Violent J:]
I need blood
Like a mosquito
I'll suck the blood out of heroin needle
I don't care how I get it
Just come with it
I'll lick the blood off your lip if you bit it
I slit my wrists and neck
And do the windmill
It'll be a blood fountain for real
I swim underwater sniffing for blood
Like a shark
But I ain't a shark
I'm a blood sucking retard (yea)
Retard

[Chorus x2]
[Blaze Ya Dead Homie:]
I been known for blood sipping
Pull the trigga
Everybody tripping
All on the carpet
Splattered on the wall
Shotgun blasts
A couple people fall
I even took a slug
I'm already dead
Cock the gauge
And made a river of his forehead
Wiped his blood on the front of my shirt
Would you die for the Lotus?
I came from the dirt

[Jamie Madrox:]
Blood, blood
The sight of it excites me
I'm such a mess
Slippery
Excuse me
I spend all day writing die on the wall
And my hands all bloody
And my fingertips raw
To the bone bone
Now I'm all alone
And Malaki speaking
Let me talking on the crow
Mixed with the blood
Only on the third night
Will allow the dead
To walk again in the sunlight

[Chorus x4]
Gimme that
Gimme that blood
Gimme that blood
Gimme that blood
