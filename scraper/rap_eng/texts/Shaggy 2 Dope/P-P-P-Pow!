Now let me tell you this while the clock is still tickin
These niggas still trippin, bitch still lickin dickin
I slipped another clip in, you step to me I'm rippin
Bullets your flesh, rippin your bloddy body trippin
See back in Detroit, I be like always dippin
Signed with Psychopathic and I'm still transistin
A bullet to your cranium, you nonexistent
My gat be on fire like the horse from Detroit Pistons

(Chorus) 2x
