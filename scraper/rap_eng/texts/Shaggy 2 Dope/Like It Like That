[Violent J]
I'll ride a fuckin' pogo stick all over your face
With Shaggy on my shoulders, addin' to the weight

[Hook]
We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
We love all hoes, skinny old hoes
Big bald hoes, we dig all those

[Hook]
We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

[Violent J]
We slap rappers in the head with the mic during freestyle wars
And get thrown out the doors

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
We rock and roll where, and think we don't care
About what the fuck is going on out there

[Hook]
We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

[Break]
Fuck you, fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck y'all

[Violent J]
When the streets go quiet, it means something wrong
I'm standin' on the corner sippin' on something strong

[Hook]
We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Channel seven eye team, hit us with the high beam
Wicked clowns droppin' them down live on the scene

[Chorus]
We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

[(Violent J) & {Shaggy 2 Dope}]
(Sometimes my dome feels like a cherry bomb)
{I got to pound his fuckin' head with a hammer to keep him calm}

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
We so deep underground, the devil came around
But got his tale chopped off by Shaggy the clown

[Hook]
We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

[Break]
Fuck you, fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck y'all

[Violent J]
We livin' in a funhouse walkin' through mirrors and walls
The floor spins and it rains in the hall

[Hook]
We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Many hate us, but we the greatest
Y'all just keep talkin', elevate us

[Hook]
We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

[Violent J]
We human cannonballs flying with no nets
Into brick walls, scarier the show gets

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
We throwin' punches hittin' faces like freight trains
Garunteed to put shit in your Hanes

[Hook]
We like it like that
Fuck you we like it like that
So fuck y'all

[Break] -x3
Fuck you, fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck y'all
Fuck you, fuck y'all

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Say fuck y'all, fuck y'all!
Man fuck you bitches! fuck y'all!
What you gonna do bitch?
I said fuck y'all!
Man fuck all you hoes!
