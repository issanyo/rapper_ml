Six feet deep, underground and beyond, They crawlin' and climbin' up
Break out the mud and do the ball bounce, show these hoes what you made up of
You ain't hearin' the clap, you ain't doin' it right, go ahead and give it up now
Tuck your baby nuts up and get the fuck out, let a professional show you how

COME ON!
THROW YOUR HANDS TO THE DIRT AND DO THE BALL BOUNCE!
THROW YOUR HANDS TO THE DIRT AND DO THE BALL BOUNCE!
THROW YOUR HANDS TO THE DIRT AND DO THE BALL BOUNCE!
Hear clap echo, is what they about
THROW YOUR HANDS TO THE DIRT AND DO THE BALL BOUNCE!
THROW YOUR HANDS TO THE DIRT AND DO THE BALL BOUNCE!
THROW YOUR HANDS TO THE DIRT AND DO THE BALL BOUNCE!
When they hear the shotgun, that's what they about

When you hear a clap'
You know I clap'
When you hear a clap'
You know I clap'
It's time for you to come runnin"
It's time for you to come runnin"
It's time for you to come runnin"
It's time for you to come runnin"

Juggalettes see us doin' it, doin' the bounce and they all wanna come join in
Switch it up and make the clap noise with my nuts bouncin' off they chin
Some bitches wanna front now like they ain't down for a pound of dick
But fuck them hoes, they can sit on the sideline when necks and meat connect

Lips part, so do my balls'
Lips part, so do my balls'
Lipstick on my drawers'
Lipstick on my drawers'
Lipstick on my drawers'

Gotta keep it dirty, down in the filth, Juggalos keep it real like that
And make them freaks stay choked in, with them ball slaps
So when the party winds down and you're ready to call it quits
Don't forget to drop your drawers and drag your balls across her lips
