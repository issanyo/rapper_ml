(Mr. Spade)
Mr. Club fuck it up! Say what? He's a nut
On the cut, cut it up, other DJs shut it up
Is the Club just a thug on the wheels of steel?
Fuck how you feel, show these other DJs how you kill
My DJ he gets down, mixing records, as they go round
With a big fat booty slap, give a bitch a bone
Mr. Club take these motherfuckers home

(Chorus x 2)
I don't use needles. I use steak knives
When I perform I gotta take ya life
I'm Mr. Club!
That's Mr. Club!
Mr. Club
He's Mr. Club!

(Mr. Diamond)
Mr. Club, the DJ assassin blastin'
Cutting into your heads with a passion
Transform chopping all those hip-hopping
DJ mix-off, he cuts lids off
You kids soft, his records are weapons
He whips off hundreds in a matter of seconds
Cutting through fools, landing back in the crate
Yo Club, give these faggots something to hate

(Chorus x 2)
I don't use needles. I use steak knives
When I perform I gotta take ya life
I'm Mr. Club!
That's Mr. Club!
Mr. Club
He's Mr. Club!

(Mr. Heart)
Mr. Club cuts it up with his motherfucking hands
Fucking over other DJs (bitch, I'm the man!)
Want to battle with my DJ? You already lost
He don't battle, he'll cut your ass up at all costs
Scratch it up Mr Club, he be scrapping in the club
Motherfucker say what? Don't get fucked up
By 2 turntables, my DJ's sick
Mr. Club show them how you get ill with the mix

(Chorus x 2)
I don't use needles. I use steak knives
When I perform I gotta take ya life
I'm Mr. Club!
That's Mr. Club!
Mr. Club
He's Mr. Club!
