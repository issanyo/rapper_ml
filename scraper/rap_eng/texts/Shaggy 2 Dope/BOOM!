A dotter like me baby
It ain't ?????
We don't work the streets
We stay above em
Won't see me on a corner with a pattern rag
I'm urination in a cut slangin heroin bags
But I do pack heat for dem fags I meet
I done came up fucked tussle over a street
I'm tryin to see paper like a state bank vault
And if I have to run through u boy it ain't my fault

U hear that thunder
That's my woofers goin boom
When we ride past ur house we be rattlin ur living room
Volume up to ten rydas hanging out the window
Dumpin on the bustas and spitin at all the fine hoes
Make a left so I can kop a bag greenery
Roll it up and pass it to the muther fuckers next to me
Let me hit that shit
We won't quit
Full clip
Cell block
Shank
Four four
And bullet
Like boom

You beggars don't matter to me
I'm like boom
Nobody lives fatter than me
I'm like boom

I'm like boom, boom, boom
You beggars don't matter to me

Nobody lives fatter than me

Arson crafts you off stat
I'm like boom, boom, boom

Bitch nigga listen, I'm the rap game
I'm like the 50 karat shining with tha platinum chain
I'm a thousand dollar bill with the big ass face
And I'm the one that bust shots when the cops give chase
I'm like boom
People always rydin my Dick
You can never see me, all black windows off in the whip
I'm in the game to make a million and I'm out this bitch
Flaunt it hard with the roadee with the ice I push
I see your whole crew sucking my Dick cos of the game
But when the nigga go, it ain't never gonna be the same
I'm on top of the world, with tha Ryda clique
I get the benefits while you bitches get to ride the Dick
Force a nigga here to ??? me
I got my ??? ??? ??? ???? ???
Come and talk ????? ??? ?? ???
Sky high till I die
And when I drop it go boom

Cell block
Four Four
