Okay, tommorow we're gonna take a look at chapters 34 and 35, alright?
And don't forget this Friday, test papers are due
No, no I told you last week that they would be due on Friday, okay?
So, make sure that's taken care of
And we'll see you tomorrow

The first pedophile
He was teacher
I waited for school to end
Under the bleachers
I walked down the halls
Dragging my ax
He was pinning papers to the board with tacks

I slipped in the room
And raised my weapon
And whistled as he turned around for a second
I buried the blade deep into his scalp
He never even had a chance to cry for help

The next pedophile
He drove a cab
I held him down
On 13th ave
We made some small talk about the weather
All while I got my wire together

He stopped at the light
Eyes on the road
I slipped my cord right around his throat
With my knees up
I yanked it back
His head fell forward into his lap

The third pedophile
He worked at home
He probably considered it his safety zone
But he was wrong
I walked right in the door
His chihuahua was barking
But not anymore

He came around the corner
I blasted him flat
And beat him horrendous with a baseball bat
Caved his skull in
And left it there
In a pile of blood, brains, bones, and hair

The next pedophile
He did construction
Showed up on the site looking for destruction
Picked up a nail gun
As soon as I spot him
He asked who the fuck I was
I shot him

Three or four more times
All in the neck
And then picked up a sledge hammer
And broke his back
Hit him again
In the back of the head

His whole skull exploded
Into a spread

The fifth pedophile
Was a children's doctor
I grabbed my hatchet
The predator chopper
Walked in his office
The nurse tried to stop me
I gave her a choice
Leave or be chopped meat

She was out of there
I kicked the door
And there he was website
Getting bored exploring
One swift swing straight down was fatal
His whole head split like a tomato

The last pedophile
He had no child
He was a bucket bum
Who lived with his mom
The lady was old
I waited for her to leave
Simple
With a 38 up my sleave

I knocked on the door
This shit is gonna be fun
I shot him in the belly
He tried to run
I shot him in both legs
And finally the head
And like that
Left him on the front lawn dead
