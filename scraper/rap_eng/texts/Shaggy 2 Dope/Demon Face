Motherfuckers always trying to steal your energy, as soon as they see you shining, and going some place or doing something. The demon faces come out and they just hate on you for no reason at all, just because you shine

(Shaggy 2 Dope)
I, I don't know, every time I see a video show
I see horrors and sharp teeth, why?
Most these puppets open butt holes up wide
I can't even walk down the street
Without these demons swinging off my meat
Demon faces appear everywhere
Mothafuckers trying to analyze my nut hair

(Anybody Killa)
I see demons everywhere
But I just keep walking like I don't care
When I'm at the mall or on the streets
They are always at drive thru's when I'm looking for eats
I can't shake them. every time I look ones coming
If I lose it, I'm afraid I'm gonna start dumping
Stay calm, clear my brain
Set fire to a face so I don't see it again

(Chorus - Esham)
They're always watching me
They see me spending money
I see the evil in your eyes
The same died they really don't want me to fly
Now I know why
(YOU GOT A DEMON FACE!)

(Monoxide Child)
Are you ready for the jump off?
I'm in a traffic jam with the punk ass cops behind me
In a raid van understand I got a demon in my trunk
And it's face change form and the hater got bucked
He kept looking at me and I started to panic
So I nutted the fuck up and let his whole crew have it
The cop hit the lights and pulled right by me
Now I'm of to burry this bitch behind me

(Violent J)
Demon coming around looking like GWAR
See them in my minds eye, I know who they are
Face pissed off, I'm there and I can't keep calm
I'm steadily exploding, just chilling, the bomb
I see Medusa seduce them with aids in they ass
And a band of necks trying to chase my cash
Better go knock on the van with some of them local openers
Cause they be hoping for you whores...

(Chorus - Esham)
They're always watching me
They see me spending money
I see the evil in your eyes
The same died they really don't want me to fly
Now I know why
(YOU GOT A DEMON FACE!)

(Jamie Madrox)
So many have that demon face, think the so real
They call me fake for goodness sake
Man I just don't know
But I advise you not to trust any them hoes
Them things ain't eyes in the front of they head
They hazard lights one and the walking dead
You're a talking head with a tail to match
Worried about my (DEMONS) mind your own scratch

(Esham)
Now I done been in all types of holy places
Situations with demon faces full of hatred
Condemn the sacred Adam & Eve was in the garden naked
That's why I never talk to a snake bitch
So I won't be bit in the snake pit
Game is immune to a venomous fake bitch
That's why they can't take it

(Chorus - Esham)
They're always watching me
They see me spending money
I see the evil in your eyes
The same died they really don't want me to fly
Now I know why
YOU GOT A DEMON FACE!
DEMON FACE!
DEMON FACE!
DEMON FACE!
YOU GOT A DEMON FACE!
DEMON FACE!
DEMON FACE!
DEMON FACE!
YOU GOT A DEMON FACE!
