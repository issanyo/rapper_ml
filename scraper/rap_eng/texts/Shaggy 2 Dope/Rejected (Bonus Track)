[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Bled from the earth I was born in the dirt
I was stepped on and steady been kicked to the curve
I've been poked fun and laughed at
Stoned as blasphemous
For practicing beliefs that others find savage
I never get them back They don't want me to play
They want it to themselves to fill their own plate
That's why I walk with rejected the brotherhood protected
Always welcome in, with the Lotus they connected

[Violent J]
Last one picked - rejected talent
Off and in many ways flawed and unbalanced
Left out, singled handily plucked from a pile
Full of imperfections and fucked all the while
No trial, no inceptions - for rejections
No passcode, road closed
No connections
So alone - nobody ever home
Somebody never known , forever on his own


[Hook]
Walking with those rejected
Where are we going?
Walking with those rejected
What whats next?
Walking with those rejected
Where are we going?
Walking with those rejected
What what-what whats next

[Monoxide]
You wish that I was buried and forgotten - a bad apple
To the core I've rotten rejected by churches and chapels
An army brat with an army that way pass beyond a tat
You can see the knifes in our back
I surrender my social existence
Flip scripts surrounded by the degenerate misfits, since
In a fence, we've been chosen to be alone
So we stand here by accepted by affected what's below

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
I did not mean to fall into it's -  it's just how i had to be
Rolling with the mainstream was inevitably unlikely
It's just what happens when you rock hand me down clothes
And a shoelace for a belt that you pulled out your mta pros
Teeth rotting out cause you cannot afford the dentist
Your main homie got it way worse than rocky denis
You might think that girl is yours, but you don't belong to her
But whatever the fuck don't kill you just makes you way stronger

[Hook]

[Jamie Madrox]

Never been a kind to ever be offended
It's alright to turn me down - my arms extended
I've been rejected and ejected out of tape deck
A life and spice with scotch tape to make soundbites
Alone the sorrow takes over [?]
Screaming in your buds got you looking over your shoulder
But no ones there
We alright here - there is no fear
When you not chosen - It all becomes clear

[Hook]


Whe-whe where are we going ?....
Wha-wha what's next ?....
