Announcement regarding the abduction of a child
As the hunt continues for a little girl who has been missing for almost two days

Why does god let 'em cry...
How can evil be so mean...

We share this planet with monsters way beyond wretched
Slice em up dissect 'em, serpents for intestines
These glitches walk among us, spawn from Satan's bowels
So black as they blood their hearts corroded and foul

They make demons look like fairies, a fear beyond the scary
They make phantoms look like phonies, the sickness that they carry
To discuss it is forbidden, may your tongue be bitten
And evil so unthinkable in children's blood it's written

So cruel it's nothing cool to the wicked it's the fools
May they burn in fire pools for demolishing the rules
Yet they weak and so pathetic on the innocent they lurk
When they strike everybody more than hurt, Sound the Amber Alert

Why does god let 'em cry, They're too young to deny
How can evil be so mean, Why don't we live to be
Why does god just turn his eye, He just lets it fly
How can people be so cold, Why don't we take control

They have hope in the beginning that this terror isn't so
Some kind of unconceivable bone, will it just let em go?
So much refusal to believe it's really happening to them
But they don't even wake up from this nightmare, This shit dont have an end

To kill yourself would be cappin' out, so you carry on
While this rancid beast cowards hiding in the unknown
Look at itself in the mirror a fire breathing soulless ogre
Looking for its chance to catch a parent slippin' up at Kroger

Or the bus stop at Must Stop, how come god has it
It's far below your common criminal, in jail they stab it
There's no punishment appropriate there's not enough hurt
For this abomination haunting the earth, Causing an Amber Alert

Why does god let 'em cry, They're too young to deny
How can evil be so mean, Why don't live to be
Why does god just turn his eye, He just lets it fly
How can people be so cold, Why don't we take control

I won't rap about specifics to glorify its actions
Gory horrified reactions meet its satisfactions
It's a devil on this earth "the devil" but only worse
I kill it with a 30 round burst, give it no hearse

No tombstone or grave plot, no obituary
Just a piece fuckin' scum shit we don't even bury
Leave it for the rodents and rats, rotten in the trash
Let some psychotic puffer fiend fuck it in its ass

I call it an it 'cause it's demonic it's not shit
It ain't a he or a she it ain't snot spit
I swear god should step up, explain how it works
How can he ever let this happen, Why do we need an Amber Alert

How can he ever let this happen, Why do we need an Amber Alert!

Why does god let 'em cry, they're too young to deny
How can evil be so mean
How can he ever let this happen, why do we need an Amber Alert!
How can evil be so mean, why don't live to be
How can evil be so mean
How can he ever let this happen, why do we need an Amber Alert!
How can evil be so mean, why don't live to be
How can evil be so mean
How can he ever let this happen, why do we need an Amber Alert!
