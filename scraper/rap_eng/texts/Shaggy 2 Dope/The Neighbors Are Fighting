[Violent J]
I got the louisville bat
Aiming for your hat
I got the louisville bat
Aiming for your hat
I got the louisville bat
Aiming for your hat
Connect and go crack
Everything splat

[Shaggy 2 dope]
I got that carjacker
Cranium cracker
I got that carjacker
Cranium cracker
I got that carjacker
Cranium cracker
Split your skull send you to the meat packer

[Violent J]
You silly little punk
You know I'm about to thump you
You silly little punk
You know I'm about to thump you
You silly little punk
You know I'm about to thump you
Slam you in the street
And fucking curp stomp you

[Shaggy 2 dope]
I'm about to act sick
Smack you with a brick
I'm about to act sick
Smack you with a brick
I'm about to act sick
Smack you with a brick
Take my boots
And stomp your nuts and dick

[Chorus: Otis]
The neighbors are fighting x7
And tearing everything up

[Violent J]
Prepare for the beat down
From a street clown
Prepare for the beat down
From a street clown
Prepare for the beat down
From a street clown
Scoop you up like trash
And beat your ass

[Shaggy 2 dope]
Mother fuckers run when I swing my axe
Mother fuckers run when I pull my axe
Mother fuckers run when I swing my axe
Mother fuckers run when I pull my axe
Mother fuckers run when I swing my axe
Mother fuckers run when I pull my axe

[Violent J]
I hear you boys got beef
Pointed to your teeth
I hear you boys got beef
Pointed to your teeth
I hear you boys got beef
Pointed to your teeth
Super man punch him
Now he's spitting out teeth

[Shaggy 2 dope]
I'll clock you with this left paw
Across your jaw
I'll clock you with this left paw
Across your jaw
I'll clock you with this left paw
Across your jaw
The sickest smackdown
Your boys ever saw

[Chorus: Otis]
The neighbors are fighting x7
And tearing everything up
