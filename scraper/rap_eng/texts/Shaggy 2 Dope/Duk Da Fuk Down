[Hook x2]
When we ride, (Whoop Whoop)
It's like an air raid, (Oh Shit)
When we ride, (Whoop Whoop)
It's like an air raid, (Oh shit)
When the rydas is ridin' upon ya
Duck the fuck down
When the rydas is ridin' upon ya
Duck the fuck down

[Verse 1: Cell Block AKA Blaze]
Fuck the games
I ain't ashamed to say I never play sincere about the cake
Getting money is my forte This shit is more than beef
There can never be peace duck in cover like Iraq
Cause you ain't safe up in the streets
Got you shaking like a leaf and the nervousness increased
Till I got you in the scope and your deceased capice?
So duck the fuck down motherfuckers we surrounding you
Suckers and your next breath is your last one left

[Verse 2: Full Clip AKA Shaggy 2 Dope]
Your bitch ass better duck, When Full Clip buck
I leave you open and your face eating asphalt
Sit back and picture me rolling in a black truck
Peeling down your block and lickin off shot's
You can use your rags to tie up your wounds
Put your body in the trunk ride you out
Burry you in the boons
Hot shells hit the floor and so them white t's
Soaked in red and bullet holes remember CLEEZY!

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Bullet AKA Violent J]
When the head lights hit cha duck, dodge, move and jump
When your body goes dead in your draw's you dumped
Double barrel pump shot gun, I got one a hot one
Blow the head off a pig every time I spot one
Soldiers posted dance under the street light
Boogie bang gangster's run your av in Illinois
When my truck come around duck the fuck down
Or the last thing you'll see is a flash and hear this sound

[Verse 4: Yung Dirt AKA Boondox]
When we ride (Hell Yeah), It's like an air raid (What)
Bitches duck the fuck down try not to get there ass shot
See your running for cover you know the rydas ain't no suckers
In them all black trucks and passing judgment on these motherfuckers
So duck down if you want to survive
Cause it's the only fucking way that your leaving here alive
Young Dirt put in work in fucking Teflon vest's
About to roll the game over catch a slug through your burnt chest

[Hook x2]

[Verse 5: Lil' Shank AKA Madrox]
My gat is hotter than the lava from inside a volcano
I'm dumping helly slug's turning thugs into angles
We bang on the block better duck the fuck down
Before we re-load the clip y'all bitches hitting the ground
Lil' shank and I'm back from the trunk with a pump
Squeezing the trigger "blast" and looking to fuck somebody up
Ryda down since the first day call it "OG"
And we dumping more sshelves than the first LP's

[Verse 6: Foe Foe AKA Monoxide]
I come ryden with the windows cracked
And lil' shank got a double barrel pointed out the back
Fo Fo in the candy paint glass all black
I'ma motherfucking ryda and you ain't that's that
Pass that pistol over here so I can get it crackin
Like an oriental new year
You must be new here, well let me tell you how to duck
Put your head between your legs and pray to god when we bust
