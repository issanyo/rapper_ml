[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I ain't coming wild as a motherfucker coming with me
Got a bulletproof vest on me, got a Glock and stalk on me
Can't stand me, but they can't stand against me
I'm prayin' everytime you see me
That one of you hoes don't try to hold me
To be honest hell ain't even ready for me
To be honest hell don't even wanna see me

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I escaped hell on a technicality
Just image how stale it'll be
The Devil, tryin' to tell me what to do, yo
I shoved his fork up his doo-doo hole
I'm fresh, my foot print these flames
I'm too dope to be locked in chains
I got another chance ho when I continue
I'm already lookin' for some dirt to get in to

[Hook x3]
Fuck death!
Better yours than mine
Livin' my life I got a long way to go
Fuck death!

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Fuck death, I'm sittin' on spikes in his waiting room
Basically debating my doom
I'mma jump back to the portal and return to Earth
(My hand popped up out of the dirt)
I'm a bad motherfucker, headbuttin the bitch
Car jacked the keys, but couldn't drive stick
So I fucked the clutch up and sputtered away
Too slick for death uhh, Violent J

[Verse 4: Koopsta Knicca]
Tryin' to kill me, snuck up with gun
But it jammed up, fucked up son
You's a retard, pray to your God
He told you "run hard, best to gain yards"
Punks and ?mic dust?, best to lock up
Best to kiss the mega bucks
Spirits in my sound, demon boogie down
I'm here the Satan now, bitch I'm alright now

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Young Wicked]
Fuck death, I'mma stay alive and fresh
With an iced out hatchet on my bulletproof vest
Takes shots I'mma tuck it, these bitches I'm fucking
Got me realize that being alive is worth something
I've escaped my death every corner
Enemy won't stop till I'mma gone up
Well I'm Young Wicked, I'm here to warn you
Killin' me ain't gonna be as easy as you want it
Fuck death!
