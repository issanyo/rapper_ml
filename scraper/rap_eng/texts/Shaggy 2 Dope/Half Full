How do you look at the world?
Is it cold?
Is your glass half empty?
Or is it half full?
I got so many questions (so many questions)
So many questions (I got)
I got so many questions (so many questions)
So many questions (I got, i got)

How come nothing seems fair to me?
How come the world has me scared to be?
Why can't people walk home alone?
How come every time the phone rings, it's a f**kin bone?
How come time's always leaving me dry?
Why do all the wise men cry?
How come there ain't enough for everyone?
**how come u can't take back the shit u've done?**
How come broke people, they stay poor?
Riches get more and both lock the doors
How come everyone has panic attacks?
We need pills just to chill and relax
How come we always jumpin off so quick?
Why's the air we breathe always making us sick?
How come the news always tryin to scare you?
Suicide bomber standin near you
How come new shit becomes old so fast?
How come everything was so much fresher in the past?
How come we all supposed to act a certain way?
Why we always gotta watch the shit that we say?
Why?
How come people love to start shit?
How come that little kids heart quit?
How come all the good is so out of reach?
Why is there broken glass on the beach?
How come fine hoes are always the meanest?
Across from you, the grass is the greenest
What's a good try if you didn't succeed?
**all of whut u got** there ain't nothing you need
How come nobody remembers your name?
And every page you turn it's the same?
How come everybody else gots plenty?
It's your glass, is it half full or half empty?
