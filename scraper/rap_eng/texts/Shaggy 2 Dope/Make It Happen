Theres no stopping me, though everybody tries
It's a one track course, labeled a destiny to shine
No motherfucker best get in my path
My hands, your neck, bitch, do the math
I be stompin, rompin, rumbling through
Leavin' piles of bodies behind me like the bird flu
Juggalos slappin face off, no question
Whippin through these hoes with harmful intentions
They call me Sewer Dweller, cause I live in the shit
Deep in the dirt, and far down beneath it
But it's time for us to rise, every full moon's eve
And servin' you fools with the Headless Boogie
Possessed by the Carnival, speakin' in tounges
Usin' human leg bones to beat my voodoo drums
And the shit don't stop til the morning sun
I make it happen, motherfucker, for Juggalo Love

(Chorus:)
I make it HAPPEN!
With no questions asked
I make it HAPPEN!
Like it's my only task
I'm sick of the truth
And I'm sick of the lies
It's about to happen, NOW
JUGGALOS, ALRIGHT!
I make it HAPPEN!
Since the day of my birth
I make it HAPPEN!
For all it's worth
I'm sick of the truth
And I'm sick of the lies
It's about to happen, NOW
JUGGALOS, ALRIGHT!

It's all bad, no good, comin' out your mouth
I'm gonna rip your jaw off and cut your tongue out
You's venomous fucker, slitherin' bitch
Nuttin you can say, nuttin can stop this death wish
Now you runnin' from the script, and beat down with the hatchet
Cause you see the majors claimin' and you can't seem to catch it
But it's just out your reach, you're never gonna grab it
Stupid motherfucker, bitin' is for faggots
Your lightbulb popped, and your spotlight broke
You got dragged through the mud, now your name is a joke
You can kiss my ass, first off this, faggot
Don't forget to fuck the fuck off, second
Ain't no time machines here, pal, you're fucked
Your momma should've taught you how to keep your mouth shut
If it wasn't for bad, you'd have no luck
I make it happen, motherfucker, get off my nuts

(Chorus:)
I make it HAPPEN!
With no questions asked
I make it HAPPEN!
Like it's my only task
I'm sick of the truth
And I'm sick of the lies
It's about to happen, NOW
JUGGALOS, ALRIGHT!
I make it HAPPEN!
Since the day of my birth
I make it HAPPEN!
For all it's worth
I'm sick of the truth
And I'm sick of the lies
It's about to happen, NOW
JUGGALOS, ALRIGHT!

Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!)
Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!)
Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!)
I can't here you, yo, where my hatchet-swingers?(RIGHT HERE!)
Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!)
Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!)
Where my hatchet-swingers?(HERE!)
I can't here you, yo, where my hatchet-swingers?(RIGHT HERE!)

When the hatchet attacks, it's known to split backs
Runnin' rabid through your hood like a rabid Hulkamaniac
In the blink off an eye, we get the bitch slappin'
Ain't no time for fuckin' around, we make it happen

(Chorus:)
I make it HAPPEN!
With no questions asked
I make it HAPPEN!
Like it's my only task
I'm sick of the truth
And I'm sick of the lies
It's about to happen, NOW
JUGGALOS, ALRIGHT!
I make it HAPPEN!
Since the day of my birth
I make it HAPPEN!
For all it's worth
I'm sick of the truth
And I'm sick of the lies
It's about to happen, NOW
JUGGALOS, ALRIGHT!

HAPPEN!(x3)
NOW, ALRIGHT!
Happen!(x3)
NOW, ALRIGHT!

Oh my God, are you going to let me die like this?
