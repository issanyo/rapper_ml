[Intro]
Find your missing link
(Find the light)
Find your missing link
(Find the light)
Find your missing link
(Find the light)
Find your missing link
(Find the light)

[Verse 1: Violent J]
On your path the bridge is broken
You in hell, no air, you chokin'
Where's your link, it's lost, you're fallin'
All the witches weight you're haulin'
You're so close, yet so far away
Running down an endless hallway
One link from your true salvation
But without it, pure damnation

[Hook]
It's missin' (It's missin')
It's Gone (It's gone)
Can't find it (Can't find it)
And my life is wrong because it's missin' (It's missin')
It's Gone (It's gone)
Can't find it (Can't find it)
And my life is wrong without it
My life is wrong without it
My life, my life is wrong

[Verse 2: Violent J]
Linkless, you fall into Hell's grip
Lost in darkness, life's a short trip
Search and seek it, or you will sink
You must believe, try hard, just think
You're in hell's hole, stuck in deep shit
Satan has fangs, your neck he bit
Look and find it, don't stop your quest
Let that shine come bursting outta your chest

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Lost in a world of pitch black terror
Scared to be alone, afraid of the mirror
All I wanna do is find what's mine
Complete my link, then let off shine
Some of us spend year after year
On the quest for what's really right there
It's up to you
Are you ready to make the change, or remain deranged
The devil is breathin' down your neck
Claws over your eyes, ridin' piggyback
And he's gonna do everything he can
To make sure that you're his man
Find your freedom, find your link
To find it, all you gotta do is think
Because as long as it's missing from your heart
You in the dark

[Hook]

[Outro]
Find your missing link (LOST)
Find your missing link (Go find it)
Find your missing link (it's missing)
Find your missing link (Go find it)
Find your missing link (LOST)
Find your missing link (Go find it)
Find your missing link (it's missing)
Find your missing link (LOST)
