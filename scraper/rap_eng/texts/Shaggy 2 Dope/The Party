[Verse 1: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I walked into the party with no invite
Which one of these hoes am I fuckin tonight?
This ain't my block and ain't my clique
But I'm up in here and ain't scared of shit
Then I heard a cut.. (who the new dude?)
The DJ tryin' to play me rude
I say "what they call you?"
(I'm DJ Clay the baddest DJ alive today, peep...)

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I had to back up and scoop my wig off the floor
It practically blew out the door
I dusted myself off and walked back up to 'em
That's pretty good shit ya doing but (what?)
I'm thinkin I'm a little bit better (oh yeah?)
Some folks call me the neck shredder
Cuz I cuts a lot too, so why don't you scoot down
(what's your name?) Shaggy the clown

[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope]
DJ Clay woke up and asked what happened
"You just witnessed this here scratchin"
Everybody gathered around the turntables
Hatchetman hangin off our cables, he said
(You and me one more time, right now)
I said, "sure thing but I'll tell you how
I'll drop the rhythm and you drop the beat
We'll let 'em feel the underground bumpin' under the street
Come on!"
