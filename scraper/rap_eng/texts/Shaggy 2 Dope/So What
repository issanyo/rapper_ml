Mr. Heart)
So What, I'm a Villain, Occupation, Robbin and Killin
So what who cares, how the world is feelin
See I dont feel shit, I got a Ice Cold Heart
I'm a crook and a star, f**k a billboard chart
I don't care, I got hoes everywhere
Mr Heart'll f**k a fine bitch in a wheelchair
So what you got some money I'll rob your ass
And throw it to the bitch with her titties on the glass
You think that you the shit, Now that you the President
Thats why your old ass wife, is on the tip of my dick
For real, Don't f**k with the Villainz
Top crime boss, in a mansion, chillin
Tell it to somebody who cares, I'm always Illin
Want your wife, your job, get a gun and start billin
The world's most wanted Soopa Doopa Bad Guys
We Don't really give a f**k Soopa Villainz can't die

(Chorus x2)
So What the f**k!
So What!
Who Gives a f**k? So f**kin What?
(So f**kin What?)
You think we gives a f**k? We'll Blow this Bitch Up!
So f**kin What?

(Mr. Diamond)
So mothaf**kin what, Bitch, Half the world is goin
Hungry
I'm in the Hidaway, countin my jewels and money
F**k you, so what, we ain't savin the planet
We tryin to kill this motherf**ker off, dead, and can't
Stand it
So what, about the homeless, with nobody to love em
I'm steady pissin in they f**kin eyes flyin above em
A Soopa Villain, Soopa Billionaire, No Charities
For the needy kids of the world, I got a pair'a these
Boo Hoo, Motha f**ka, Wah Wah Wah
So What Get Coked up, and f**k sluts
I dont Care, You're barely hangin on anymore
I'm stompin on your f**kin fingers, see you on the
Floor
Don't cry to me bitch, Mr Diamond ain't the one
We're here to end it all, Problems only begun
No Allies, We're happy to see you dyin off
And we came just in time to send your head flyin off

(Chorus x2)
So What the f**k!
So What!
