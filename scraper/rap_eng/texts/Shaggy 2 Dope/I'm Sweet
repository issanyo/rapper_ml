[Verse 1]
Let me tell you something, brother
I’m a motherfucker
I’m a fucking beast the opposite of a sucker
If you my homie and we out and you get into a fight
I’m jumping in that motherfucker, fucking kicking and biting
I don't care if it's 21 on one
I got your back, son, with a punch like a gatling gun
Because I'm sweeter than a sugar lemon lollipop
Hanging out with me I get you higher than a molly pop
I got bitches of every nationality and color
That will do anything for me I never tell 'em I love her
I catch a bullet in my fist, Dark Lotus on my wrist
I’m a killer in the mist, homie, you get the gist
I'll take that bully that fucks with you, and break his damn back
DDT him on the sidewalk, make the cement crack
I do a dance and make the sun come out and shine on us
I’m a gump but my aura makes me some kind of adonis
Cause I'm sweet

[Chorus]
I’m sweet
I’m sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet)
I'm sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet (so fucking sweet!)

[Verse 2]
I take a five to the casino and leave a millionaire
I be at two places at once, at home and still be here
I can ride a tiger through the jungles of Peru
Squeeze a coal into a diamond and give it to you
I know important people all over the globe
Walk into the club a stud with slow motion strobe
Bitches scream when they see me, I look better than a TV
I do the chicken dance and they all follow to be me
I built a shelter for the homeless, a five-star resort
With swimming pools, hot tubs, basketballs and tennis courts
I'm sweeter than a cotton candy Faygo two liter
I broke down the door and stomped the fucking wife beater
And now she’s on my arm completely out of harm
I’m smoother than a baby's butt and softer than charm
I bought my mom and dad a yacht so they can travel the seas
Fucking money blows out my ass everytime i sneeze
Cause I’m sweet

[Hook]
I’m sweet
I’m sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet
I’m sweet (I’m sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet (so fucking sweet!)
I'm sweet (I'm sweet)
I'm sweet (so fucking sweet!)

[Verse 3]
I got a shoulder you can lean on
Solutions to your problems
I slayed a fucking dragon, plus I killed a hundred goblins
I rescued three babies from a burning inferno
It was a walk in the park, ain’t even write it in my journal
I can scale up the side of a wall like spider man
Just place my palms on the brick and simply tighten my hands
And like a ninja, I know 17 styles of kung fu
And all the kids they love me cause I'm a lot of fun too
Testarossas all around for all of my boys
Smash 'em right into a tree; who cares? They're just toys
I throw a party every night, gangbangers come together
For a time, they forget what set they out for the better
I get people out of prison, the governor's my dude
Fresh out they cell and back home to mama’s food
I'm like that: sweeter than a birthday cake and ice cream
Yes, motherfucka, ain’t that a nice dream

[Ending]
I’m sweet (I'm sweet, sweet)
I’m sweet
I'm sweet (I'm sweet)
I'm sweet (so fucking sweet!)
I'm sweet (oh yeah)
I'm sweet (sweet)
I'm sweet (woohoo!)
I'm sweet (so fucking sweet!)

[Outro, leads into "Time"]
Let's take our time, we've got time
Let's kill some time, it's almost time
We're wasting time, running out of time
Where'd all our time go?
There's no more time
Where'd all our time go?
We're out of time
