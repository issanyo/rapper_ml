We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn

[Verse 1]
Don't ask us where we got it we made it ourselves
Directions are online but you better be stealth
We drove out to the boonies
No one in sight
We found an old barn in the dead of the night
I opened the trunk I can smell the gasoline
Gripped it in my hands yeah this bad boy is mean
Aimed it at the barn lift the tip and pull the switch
The flame shot all over it and burned down that bitch
The dark of the night was suddenly bright light
I felt the heat blast on my face my skin felt tight
We quickly put it back in the trunk and then jet-ed
This motherfucker worked perfectly
Now we headed down south
To see what kinda shit we can pull
If we get pulled over shit they gotta go
Don't want nothing stopping us from completing our tour
With one instrument the motherfucking flamethrower

[Hook]
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn

[Verse 2]
It was a long drive I could have fell asleep at the wheel
But I'm rolling on adrenaline this shit is for real
We did our research well and we picked out our spots
We know who were cooking when we spit out the hots
The first is a racist biker gang called "The Rebels"
They bout to have funerals but no need for shovels
Cause we gonna cremate these fools bones to ashes
Rolled in the club house of flash the gases
Then we walk backward and jumped in our ride
As black smoke pillowed into the sky
Many of them ran out still engulfed in flames
We peeled off bumping that reindeer games
We hit the freeway I was still in a trance
That was someones foot I almost pissed my pants
Don't want nothing stopping us from completing our tour
With one instrument the motherfucking flamethrower

[Hook]
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker burn

[Verse 3]
We headed through South Carolina a triple K rally
I didn't think they had these anymore but sadly they do
So we might as well cook the last of em'
The town hall bout to turn into an oven
We walked in the back door into the main room
Seen all the white hoods and kaboom
We quickly saw that they uniforms are flammable
Torched every one of them then we had to go
We was out with the quickness straight to West Virginia
Awaits the judge and the police for us yeah we getting ya
Two and a half days now without sleep
We pulled into town slowly on the creep
We parked the car and started walking in we heard freeze
We were spotted by the cops I flipped the switch and squeezed
As we got shot we burned them alive
Our mission was completed though we didn't survive

[Hook]
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
Gasoline (they shoulda got)
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker
We don't need no water, we don't need no water
Let the motherfucker
