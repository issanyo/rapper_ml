[Intro:]
{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
So there I am, right?
Standin in front of the store
And this muthafucka wants to pull up
And has the gall to say to me...

[Verse 1:]
{Violent J:}
Watch my ride while I'm inside
This bitch is new, worth more than you
Don't stand too close, just stand on post
And watch my ride while I'm inside (Fuck you!)
Watch my whip, don't even trip
It's cherry-dip, so save that lip
Eyes on them spokes, I'm grabbin smokes (Ha ha ha)
Watch my ride while I'm inside

[Hook:]
(And that's) When we fuck 'em up!
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up!
[2x]

[Verse 2:]
{Shaggy 2 Dope:}
Well I took his life and I took his ride
And I took 'em both to the echo side
The cops ain't on to me yet in this big city
Down a back road pushin 150
Surfin on the roof of this sweet ass car
Wicked clown alive wit no driver
Ghost rider, jump off into the night
When the car wraps up inside a street light

[Bridge:]
Watch my ride...
Watch my ride...
Watch my ride, watch my ride
Watch my ride, watch my ride while I'm inside

[Hook:]
(And that's) When we fuck 'em up!
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up!
[4x]

[Verse 3:]
{Violent J:}
Watch my ride while I'm inside
You see them wheels? Electric eels
My shit is rare, you barely there (I'm everywhere)
So watch my ride while I'm inside (Blow these nuts)
You nobody, I throw money
You might get some, so don't be dumb
I hold the keys (Fuck you) still rollin D's (Fuck you)
Watch my ride (Kiss my ass) while I'm inside (Fuck you!)

[Hook:]
(And that's) When we fuck 'em up!
Fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up, fuck 'em up!
[4x]

[Outro:]
High School teacher has been charged
With sexually assaulting a student
So far this year thirty people have been killed
Triple the number of this time last year
