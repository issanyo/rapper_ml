There comes a time, every so often, when the Dark Carnival begins to swell with the countless souls awaiting judgement
And the thriving mob begins to tear at each other to find a place in lines that stretch out of view
And as attractions open wide to accommodate crowds frantically clawing their way inside
He will come to perform the cleansing. As the seething masses turn to witness him growing near
Their eyes attempt to make out his face forming within the looming smoke

Suddenly, Bang!
Like a continuous explosion, he moves down upon them full of thunderous fury, enveloping the masses in darkness

Then, Pow!
A deep, resonating explosion of unparalleled intensity
Those still alive begin to feel a warm rain upon their charred skin, which they soon realize is the blood of the shredded victims

They can only lay screaming in pure, stark terror, when Boom!
An earthshaking explosion of catastrophic proportions erupts
Causing all to collapse inward into a finite point of brilliant, horrific energy
You may call him "Bang! Pow! Boom!"

Bang... Pow... Boom...
