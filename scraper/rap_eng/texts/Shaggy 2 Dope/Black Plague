(Mr. Spade)
Mr Spade Black Plague, who dares?
Finna f*** this world up, who cares?
Show me where the Villainz at that shoot theirs
Now pull your gun out motha f****, you scared
I, run, and bust my gun at everyone
Black Militant, reason that I carry one
Loved so many ninas, I think I'd better marry one
Cop gets stupid, I might bury em
Black Panther, Murdas My national anthem
Rollin in a Bulleproof Bently Phantom
Black Plague! Voices spread all in ya head
Screamin at once Tellin you that Ya Dead
Know the world ain't prepared fore the fire and flare
Bubonic, Demonic, Black smoke fills the air
Black Plague! You scream and you beg for mercy
No way to reason with a shark when he blood thirsty

(Chorus)
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!

(Mr. Spade)
The Black Plague epidemic, and no it's not a gimmick
Soopa Villain Mr Spade, I represent it
The first time Black Plague Murda Style Mimiced
They'll find him at the funeral home, not at the clinic
The Black Plague, chopped off heads left in streets
F*** the police, No Justice, No Peace
Mask on my face with the Spade Sign
Bust 2 slugs in a K 9
The Black Plague is coming, So stop your runnin
Mr Spade is gunnin bustin
No need to be cryin You just dyin, end of discussion, rushin
The Black Plague wrote on your stomach
The Black Plague will make you vomit
The Black Plague got a 3 5 7 pointed at you
Mr Spade and I'm it



(Chorus)
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!
(Mr. Spade)
Black Plague got you scared to come out ya house
You feelin kinda dizzy think you finna black out
Your back's against the wall, ain't no way to back out
Mr. Spade got you fiendin like you finna crack out
Got My army fatigues on, gettin my speed on free
And b**** don't bleed on me
Patches on your body Eatin you like Ebola
Black Plague got you think you about to die
Black Plague, look in the sky you see it changing
Black Plague, the sky is fallin yall in danger
Mr Spade, Stranger, keep one in the chamber
Black Plague, Soopa Villain filled with anger
I hate everyone, It's never personal business
Mr Spade thats who did this
Hit you with the murder weapon So ridiculous
And X one more victim off my s*** list

(Chorus)
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
It's the Black Plague!
Got you scared or is it all in your head?
