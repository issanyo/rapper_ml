(Wha-wha-wh- What type of man)

[Verse 1: Violent J
I plant bombs in my lawn
For 18 hours, who think I'm wrong?
Pistol crossbow in each arm
Explosive arrows, can't keep calm
I blow thee, with an RPG
So much smoke you can hardly see
Bodily harm, fire on lawns
Mountain acid gonna burn down the farm

[Hook: Young Wicked]
What types of man to come with these atrocities
I can feel the heat its all around me
Laying here in the street my chest exploding
I'm pinned down
Yet never knowing why...

(Radio: The post office was the location for a random bombing that happened at 2:30--)

(Wha-wha-wh- What type of man)

[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]
I build pipe bombs with duct tape
Fill it with gunpowder, that’s all it takes
Get me a wick, long or quick
And when it blows, molecules split
Mushroom cloud a boom so loud
I took out the crowd, I’m so proud
Connect these wires, twist with pliers
I’m sick and a coward, no one to admire

[Hook]

(Radio: Police officers located the truck on left on road at 13:47  )

(Wha-wha-wh- What type of man)

[Verse 3: Violent J]
Rainforest jungles, deserty sands
Downtown with buildings
I’ll shake your land
Plastic explosives, my specialty
You’ll lose a limb, fuckin’ with me

[Verse 4: Shaggy 2 Dope]
Batteries they come
Cables and sensors
Right on they neck and
There go my answers
FBI wanna take me down
Two to my chest my heart no longer pounds

[Hook]

(Radio: ???? Then by striking it with a hammer.)
