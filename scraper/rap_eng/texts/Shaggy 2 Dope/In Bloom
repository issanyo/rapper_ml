[Shaggy 2 Dope]
We in bloom, many thoughts rearranging
Pollen's everywhere, that's the reason that we're changing
Flourish in the rise of the new times
Taking lives, nobody survives
You got your hatchet, throw it in the sky
Five pedals appear right before your eyes
(Don't) Don't get attached to your head like a neck
Cause I'll disconnect, Dark Lotus in effect

[Blaze Ya Dead Homie]
Rise out the water for the first worst nightmare
Lotus pedals bloom and take shapes off in the night air
Here we got the wicked to share and didn't nobody care
Til they see the shadow creeping, now they all scared
Gone but not forgotten, in the dark they leave us rotting
With the crosses on our face that's the symbol of the downtrodden
Dark Lotus return, the reason is the word
The season for the shepherd is now to lead the herd

[Hook]
This is the returning
Everything you tried to bury
In between the patch of roses makes the
Lotus rise, Lotus rise
Winds of deadly ages
Makes the blood drip down the pages
And between the dying roses makes the
Lotus rise, Lotus rise

[Violent J]
Flourishing underneath the rays of the moon
The winds of change about the rains that bloom
The five disciples of the Lotus Cross rise up from the swamp seed, weed, and moss
The time has come, our return is evident
Straight outta Hell's hole or Heaven-sent
We in bloom, the haunting of the flower
Throw your DL's high and feel power

[Monoxide]
Metamorphosis for most change
I survive in the dark with no rain
Chemical imbalance embedded inside of my brain
And all I can think of is how they continue to strain
I'm a descendant to pass on, hoping to latch on
And pollinate anything with a mask on
A black rose is the sign of your death
When the sight of the Lotus brings death to the rest

[Hook]

Lotus rise
Deserts are freezing, so we know that it's time
Lotus rise
The hills are burning, so we know that it's time
Lotus rise
The water's rising, so we know that it's time
Lotus rise
The crops are dying, so we know that it's time
Lotus rise

[Jamie Madrox]
Coming up through the ground like a corpse
But I'm not a corpse, of course, I'm a Lotus in full bloom
Petals made up of botics that shoot through the dirt
To regenerate in sunlight and flourish to bring doom
Upon the suspected affection it grows slow
In the depths of stagnant water down below
Somewhere where the lights don't shine at all
We await in a watery tomb for them to call
