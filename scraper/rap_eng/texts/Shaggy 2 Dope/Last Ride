Pour out a little liquor live by the gun die by the gun
My Moms had always said when I was young I wouldn't last long
She said I was too crazy only concerned with makin babies
Never lookin for work the streets raised me for war
Schooled in laws of currency by the ways of robbery thought
They never stop me I keep it way too greasy but
Like all good things sometimes they gotta end my memory
Lives on in every system that you bump this is in
Now that all the weed has been smoked and all the laws have been broke
Give me a moment of silence cuz im stopping the violence its my last ride my last time the last rhyme the last of the real Gs thatve truly crossed the line don't shed a tear for me my shit was history and how they feel for me will never be a mystery my memory is stronger than the faith that's in that reverand layin my body to the ground and all my peoples around my last ride my last ride ill see you on the other side its so hard to say goodbye I really don't wanna say goodbye my last ride you was hatin everything I said I was livin suicidal rollin with the walkin dead my last ride I was lookin in from the outside my last ride was so tight comforts gonna be alright my last ride with the reaper in the 45 my last ride in the plane no parachute and skydive
(My last ride) on the way to my funeral service
(My last ride) Im not cryin cuz I know I deserved it
(My last ride) Put my body in the coffin and drop me
(My last ride) I was destined to ride nothing could stop me
The last time I seen that shell well damn I pierced the forehead and exploded the head of that man sorry and as his body crumpled check this hear I picked the casing up and I had to shed a tear(fuck that)cuz I knew and it knew wed never see again florensic cops had took my little friend(give it back)I had to skip town and leave my baby brother but im cool in the last moments I watched a head splatter Don't follow me make your own way theres to many baby Gs layin in the casket today and that's a shame pour out a sip of foty but it won't bring your homie back cuz when you live by the gat you gonna end up on yo back wearin a suit covered in dirt like a sycamore tree my homies gone and this reality its sad to see his family and all the riders wellin up and breaking down
