[Violent J]
Stepping out of the whipping and piercing rain
In walks a wicked clown... (Whoop Whoo-oo-ooop)
Violent J
One of death's good friends they say (hey, look at that)
You've never seen a cloud that dark in the middle of the day
Headed straight this way, I hope everything's okay

[Chorus]
(Move, Duck, Everybody run!) - Repeat
The sky is falling
This shit's gonna be fun, be fun, be fun
I think the sky is falling
This shit's gonna be fun, be fun, be fun
The fucking sky is falling
This shit's gonna be fun, be fun, be fun
I feel the wind is calling me

[Shaggy 2 Dope]
Spinning back down to earth riding in a tornado
Lands a wicked clown... (Whoop Whoo-oo-ooop)
Shaggy 2 Dope (Southwest Strangla!)
Known to give the dead hope (Whooo)
And the air is right for some impending judgement
(when it rains, it pours)
And judging by the look of the sky
This might be it... (Judging by the look of the sky)

[Chorus] - 2X
