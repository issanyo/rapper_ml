Chorus:
{Legz Diamond}
How the fuck could this be?
Up in the sky?
There is a rainbow over the hood!
[3x]

Verse 1:
{Violent J}
Let's see, we got homes abandoned, fires flare
Don't dare walk down over there
Hookers, pimps, Oxi80's
Trailer park meth labs, crack babies
In the spot, workin' cook up
Walk outside, take a look up
It's a rainbow over the city
Look back down around you, shitty!

{Shaggy 2 Dope}
Gun shots heard, killers are lurkin'
Yet still I hear the birds are chirpin'!
This world ain't meant for this
So much bliss, but easy to miss!
Rubbers on the sidewalk, used syringes
Stuck in a hotel, two week binges
Look high in the sky to remind you
Even if you're lost, rainbows will find you!

Chorus:
{Legz Diamond}
How the fuck could this be? (There's a rainbow!)
Up in the sky? (Over the ghetto!)
There is a rainbow over the hood! (There's a rainbow... Over the hood!)
[2x]

Verse 2:
{Violent J}
Built with AIDS, Pepsi, coke
I ain't talkin' Pepsi, crack smoke!
All in the rain, down the drain
Mom’s in pain, need that boy in her veins!
It's so hard, so many distractions
So much negative action
Keeps your attention placed
Off the magic and on the waste!

{Shaggy 2 Dope}
If you see a rainbow, look quick
Potholes will wreck yo' shit!
Don't get caught dreamin' I hope, *Gun cocking*
Ya head might get locked in a scope! *Gun Shot*
If you standin' there, lookin' at a rainbow
You might wonder, "Where'd your brains go?"
For everyone that wanna see you succeed
A hundred mo' wanna see you bleed!

Chorus:
{Legz Diamond}
How the fuck could this be? (There's a rainbow!)
Up in the sky? (Over the ghetto!)
There is a rainbow over the hood! (There's a rainbow... Over the hood!)
[2x]

Bridge:
{Violent J}
Cars on blocks, little dumb glow
Skies above, where'd our wind go?
Body in the alley wit' blew out brains
There'll still be a rainbow after it rains!

Verse 3:
{Violent J}
Rainbows don't hate or discriminate
It's mankind’s fate to create mistakes
Just look at the skies, above the gutter
Above the warzones, above each other
Rainbow's stretch over lands of ruin
Over troubles brewin', whatever we doin'
Don't live blind, a sheep in line
Find it, make the best of yo' time!

{Shaggy 2 Dope}
G Codes, street laws, rules I drop
We only get this one chance, I won't throp
I want mo' than I got, I'mma find the pot
At the end of the rainbow, like it or not
I'm not gon' rot, stop on the block
Shot by a cop in the parkin' lot
When my feet stop least I gave it a shot
No regrets when my death goes pop!

Interlude:
Look! (There's a rainbow!)
Where? (Over the ghetto!)
Right there! (There's a rainbow... Over the hood!)

Chorus:
{Legz Diamond}
How the fuck could this be? (There's a rainbow!)
Up in the sky? (Over the ghetto!)
There is a rainbow over the hood! (There's a rainbow... Over the hood!)
[2x]

Outro:
There's a rainbow! (Over the ghetto!)
There's a rainbow! (Over the hood!)
