[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Please man, pretty please
With a cherry on top, can you please—?

Cause I'm sipping Pro, yeah, that meth is pro

Oh, they acting up? Get your weapon drawn
They only killing time, another second gone

But you acting young and you hella grown

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Okay, she giving me love, but it fuck my energy up
Every time it's finna be summer, only got the memories of us
And now we industry lovers, they making enemies of us
I mean, sometimes we in public, they drain this energy from us
Visit Italia, be my señorita

Credit charge, Kermit the Frog, margaritas

Yeah, he wanna lay the hands on me
But he should see the way she dance on me
Yeah, wishing I ain't had no pants on me
