There was a family of quicks on my block
A family we all knew
I'm talkin' bout John, Damian, and that boy Jrue
They had an unfair proof that lived in their shoe
Technological truth made'em quicker than you
Their quick was quick
I'm talkin bout the quickest quick ever seen
From outside the gym you could hear the crowd scream
Challengers and challenges brung'em to the floor
They cut and crossed over until there wasn't no more
Competition that is
People keep asking you what's up in that shoe
First draft pick, rookie of the year, all star games too
Looking back on the sell homie, who would've even knew
That all of that quick could come from inside of a shoe?
Those kicks made these cats rare
And when you crazy quick, man quick ain't fair
