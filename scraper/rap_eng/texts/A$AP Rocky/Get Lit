[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
I get so high, I touch the sky 'til I can't even function
I get so high, I fuck around and wanna leave the function
The only thing that's on my mind is I'm gon' leave with something
But it's nothing, and we roll one, with the 'tussin, and we gon' get
Get, get, get, get lit, lit, lit, lit
Get, get, get, get lit, lit, lit, lit
Get, get, get, get lit, lit, lit, lit
Get, get, get, get lit, lit, lit, lit

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
It's about to go down, drunker than a bitch
Afterparty with my niggas, slumber party with your bitch
Finna hit the lick, 10-56, takin' sips, let the syrup sit
Let it get the mix, every day we gettin' gettin' lit
That Purrp purp and I get lit, 'methazine, tell 'em sip this
I'm on that Memphis, that 666, Trip Six shit, bitches
A 50 box of them Swishers, gold slabs on them 6's
In the back seat full of bitches, tryna hit licks, we gon' get lit

[Chorus]
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
We about to get lit

[Interlude: Fat Tony]
Young niggas mayne, young nigga out here
Niggas staying in the trap, nigga
Niggas mad how a young nigga out here
Tryin to do his thang mayne, you know, pimp thing
Young player out here in these streets mayne

Niggas so throwed like we don’t know no better, nigga

Mama wanna grab the switch
We like "Fuck that, nigga, we out here, mayne"
Coming down, coming live

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Just light the candle on the nightstand, sitting by the lotion
I got her open, got her floating off this purple potion
Just take a hit, no time to quit because you gotta smoke this
I gotta focus when I pour it cause it's kinda potent
(She like them all gold slugs) No diamonds on it
I chunk the deuce, I'm coming down and I be riding spokes and
I be that pretty mothafucka' and you got to know this, this
Now we gotta go get, get, now we gotta go get

[Chorus]
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
We about to get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
Get lit, get, get lit, get, get lit
We about to get lit

[Outro: Fat Tony]
Young nigga from the southside of H-Town
Fat Tony up in this bitch, fuckin' with A$AP Rocky in this bitch
Out in NY, Harlem in this bitch
You know how young niggas connect from state to state
Feeling great, nigga, puttin' it in ya face, nigga
Out in the morning making this shit happen dawg
Young niggas ain't never understand
How we stay so throwed in this hoe, nigga
Niggas so throwed like we don’t know no better, nigga
We disobedient, nigga
Mama wanna grab the switch
We like "Fuck that, nigga, we out here, mayne"
Coming down, coming live
