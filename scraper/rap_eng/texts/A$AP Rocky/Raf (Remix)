Please don’t touch the ralph
Please don’t interrupt
Please don’t tell me not to stand up on the couch
Please don’t tell my girl  not run to mouth
How I’m quarter backing
And I’m running route
That be jerry rice
Baby heres the point
I’m just trying live a legendary life
Anyway you cut it I’m get a slice
Hold up can you wait for me
At the age of 5 i had designer clothes
Now i  design the flow that come overpriced
Pattern making  hitting right , taylor made fitting nice
Gin & juice for every vice as I’m watching vice
And the point i make will you sell your soul
For the threads you wear
You don’t look for time on the rolle watch
See the question is, if the diamonds drip
And its really ice
Is there water here
Can you feed the land while theres hurricanes
Can you turn the wrist into a reservoir
Like I’m taratino with the reservoir dogs
Lord
And the shades and different hues
Represent all the colors in my crew
Represent all the different point of views
But my point is to put it in a way
Where everyone don’t feel misunderstood
Oh lord
Let this be church
If you ready just let em rehearse
I’m giving them life
Renny just told me if they think twice
You dig up the dirt, they made their bed
Just let em get comfy and sleep and hurst
From  dying of hunger your stomach will hurt
Using my voice fulfilling the thirst
With no codeine or sprite
Cause I gotta stay woke  for tonight
Shit i had to work  million overnights
You know them 40 hour weeks
When you gotta hustle and  never sleep
Either you were broke or forgot to eat
Either hit the stu or hit the street
Go lebron and you hit the league
I be like lebron flow indeed
Matter fact I’m gil scott with poetry
Running through my blood
And its flowing deep
And you learn to grow
When you plant the seed
Just a little faith and a mustard seed


Ain't no limits to this here
Bunch of rejects in my clique
You know i cook it
I make it from scratch
Throw on a apron
And whip up a batch
Fuck all the labels
I rip off the tag
Fuck your versace medusa  MY BITCH
I booteg the cable
And kill the robots
