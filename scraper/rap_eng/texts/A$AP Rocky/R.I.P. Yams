BMW, a Black mans wealth
Fuckin' with my brother, I'ma lead you to the death
BMW, a Black mans wealth
Fuckin' with my brother, I'ma lead you to the death

[Verse 1: SpaceGhostPurrp]
Diamonds rings and luxury
Fake niggas don't fuck with me
Black on black like the cuffing link
Got your bitch all under me
Tell me who you want to be
Rich is what I'm gonna be
Got a mind of a .45, A$AP clan on MTV
Lyrically on a galaxy
Baby girl why you mad at me?
Cause your home girl look better than you
And me and you wasn't meant to be?
Gotta do shit physically
Don't care much bout verbally
Only time a nigga speak is when he feel it mentally
Swervin' smooth in a Bentley
All I do is stay lowkey, Brisco Park, OBH
Chart go in, my nigga, [?]
Time fly but not fly to me
Everything is perfectly
Weird mansions out east
All about...

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I blow weed out the sour glass
She sniff dust out the hour glass
Gettin' dough, time is movin' slow while the hour pass
Need a power nap
Givenchy, probably Rafs
Gold teeth and the hockey mask
I'm turnt up, that's no lie, that's true story no polygraph
Rainman need a cold chief, can't walk with shoes get cold feet
You on OJ, I'm on OG, Triple OG but its lowkey
Get high, my nigga, smoke weed
So high I'm in the nose bleed
Bitches know I drive it slow
I took the flow and I go deep
Fuck that shit, my nigga buzzin'
Tell a hoe that I'm buggin'
Gold sluggin, I ain't something
Ask mymother, sister, cousin
All I do is I keep frontin'
Number 1 how I'm stuntin'
Come through Hummers but I like the Beamer
Tell a bitch she can suck my penis
