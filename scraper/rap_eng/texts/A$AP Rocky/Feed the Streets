[Intro]
Mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia
Shut the fuck up
If Young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I gotta feed the streets (ayy)
I gotta feed the streets (ayy)
I gotta feed the streets (ayy)
I gotta feed the streets (ayy)
My niggas need to eat (ayy)
My niggas need to eat (ayy)
I gotta feed the streets
Don't worry 'bout it
I gotta, I gotta feed the streets

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Niggas do time flipping the Ye
Niggas is dead, he got a grave
Nigga, I ain't playin', tryna get paid
Homie got hit 'cause he got in the way
Had to get out, shit is the same
Niggas insane all this shit change
They wanna a name, they had him sprayed
They gotta catch a body for fame
I'm in a whole other lane (lane)
Flipping these racks like cane (cane)
I got rich and gave back (gave back)
And you niggas stayin' the same (hell naw)
I drive the Wraith through the hood (yes)
That's why my niggas in the grind (yes sir)
Show all my niggas how to get this money, just gotta put in the time
Real niggas know, how hard I go (I get this cash)
I put in work, I put niggas on (So much cash)
Them mafia days (Mafia!), my hustle so strong (Mafia!)
Real shit, I'm lit like a cigarette lighter, I was doing this shit when you was shitting in diapers

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
My niggas need to eat (eat)
My niggas need to eat (eat)
I gotta feed the streets
Don't worry 'bout it
I gotta, I gotta feed the streets
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
My niggas need to eat (eat)
My niggas need to eat (eat)
I gotta feed the streets
Don't worry 'bout it
I gotta, I gotta feed the streets

[Verse 2: Project Pat]
I gotta feed the streets
My pistol gon' bleed the streets
Ski mask on my face, sometimes you gotta cheat
Just stay ahead in this bitch
Drankin' sizzurp like its liquor
Street life, but I'm catching up to god quicker
AK-40 to your liver
Make the chopper bang on you like a blood or a crip, ah
So much bread, I'm a gymnast
Made so much money off of dummies, a ventriloquist (Yeah hoe!)
Or a puppetteer, diamonds in my ear
New foreign ride every year, I'm in foreign gear
Plug show up with the pack, it's gon' disapear
Stick shift hustle, I stay in fifth gear

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
My niggas need to eat (eat)
My niggas need to eat (eat)
I gotta feed the streets
Don't worry 'bout it
I gotta, I gotta feed the streets
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
My niggas need to eat (eat)
My niggas need to eat (eat)
I gotta feed the streets
Don't worry 'bout it
I gotta, I gotta feed the streets

If young Metro don't trust you, I'm gon' shoot you
Mafia

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
I gotta feed the streets
You gotta flee the streets
You gotta lead the streets
I don't mislead the streets
I just might drop some heat
I just might tease the street
I do not need the streets
'Cause nigga, I be the streets
It's so sad 'cause my little bad
Bitch, don't know how to act
Like in the past
When she took 'em packages out the trap
I let her chase the dream
I might front-lace her weave
Give her a place to stay, with a new face to feed
I really love the streets
I just might flood the streets
'Cause I'm really from the streets
Y'all niggas who run the streets
Niggas just take a seat
How the fuck could you hate on me?
Say that you still in the streets, but you can not wait to leave

[Chorus: Juicy J]
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
My niggas need to eat (eat)
My niggas need to eat (eat)
I gotta feed the streets
Don't worry 'bout it
I gotta, I gotta feed the streets
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
I gotta feed the streets, ayy
My niggas need to eat (eat)
My niggas need to eat (eat)
I gotta feed the streets
Don't worry 'bout it
I gotta, I gotta feed the streets

[Outro]
Mafia!
Mafia!
Mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia, mafia
