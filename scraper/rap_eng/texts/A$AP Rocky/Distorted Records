[Intro]
Uh, uh

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the bass, from the ceiling to the basement
I don't feel a thing, get the fuck up out my face, bitch
I don't feel a thing, yeah I'm faded, yeah I'm shaded
I don't feel a thing, I can feel the bass, I can feel the bass

[Chorus]
Distorted, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted records, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted records
(what more distorted records do you have?)

[Verse]
First things first, I done heard the worst things
Like if I'm in your top 10, mine's better be the first name
Out your mouth, ain't even worth saying
Little niggas is my offsprings
They deserve a nigga first name, middle name, surname
From another planet, birthplace, Cloud 9, hello earthlings
My newest President an asshole
I guess that's why I'm leaving turd stains
My ex used to chill with bad tings
All they talked about was bird things
Tried to put them on Bad Brains
But bird hoes got the bird brains
Everything I do groundbreak
Big body make the floor break
Big bass make the world shake
Flacko out here causin' earthquakes, uh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Uh, I can feel the bass, uh, I can see the fakes
Word to T.D. Jakes, uh, word to Pastor Ma$e and Kirk Franklin
Fuck what niggas think, I'm about the bank
Comma, dollar signs, I'm about my Franklins
I can feel the bass

[Chorus]
Distorted, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted records, distorted records (I-I can feel the bass)
Distorted records
