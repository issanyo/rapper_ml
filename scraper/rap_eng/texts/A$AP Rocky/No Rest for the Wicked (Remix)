[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
You love me too much
Don't let me do much
She love me too much, at least she use to
Then I used her, I abused her
Never thought I'd ever lose her
I confused her, but I refuse to
Be so wicked, hallelujah

[Lykke Li]
My one heart hurt another
So only one life can't be enough
Can you give me just another
For that one who got away?

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Lonely I, I'm so alone now
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
You let them win without a fight

[Lykke Li]
If one heart can mend another
Only then can we begin
So won't you hold on a little longer?
Don't let them get away

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Lonely I, I'm so alone now
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no hope for the weary
You let them win without a fight

[Lykke Li]
I let my good one down
I let my true love die
I had his heart but I broke it every time

[Verse 1: Dahaq]
W-w-wait a minute wait a minute she ambitious she my type
She came to save me just in the nick of time
What I’m here for, simply steady live my life
Sip this liquid since they tell me that’s the ticket right?
Heart cold ain’t old yet I’m fully grown
“Come bring me home”, girl no, you know I’m gone
Do nothing wrong that’s what mama told...
But since you’re born, you go through it all alone
Different day same shit call it a homophone
Never respond to no texts nor call my phone
Looking good tonight girl I’m talking head to toe
Imagine what you’d say if I said it though
Jeans fitting right hit me up we taking flight
Nothing in between us except the liquor ice
Go to paradise, roll the dice, to be precise
All I desired was to live it twice, live it twice
T-t-tell me sweet-nothings, I’m leaving with my weed running
But If I see something I’m going up with her, tree hugging
And ima keep stunting if she tell me she still fussy
I’ll tell her forget these people judging just trust me
See watch me how I toss out every stereotype
Telling me there’s no rest for the wicked right?

[Dahaq]
Yeah, no rest for the wicked right?
No rest for the wicked right?

[A$AP Rocky]
No question, if love don't work it's just gone hurt
It all goes bad, it just gets worse
I can't describe with just one verse

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
Lonely I, I'm so alone now
There'll be no rest for the wicked
There's no song for the choir
There's no home for the weary
If you let them win without a fight

[Lykke Li]
I let my good one down
I let my true love die
I had his heart but I broke it every time

[Outro: A$AP Rocky (Dahaq)]
Wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked, wicked (wicked) (x2)
(Wicked)
