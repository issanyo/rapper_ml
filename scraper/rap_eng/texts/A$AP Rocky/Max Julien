[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Hello, it's the Mack, sit back and relax
As we chat on ways to make a couple stacks off your snatch
Hold up, here's the catch, you might have to hit the track
Take a loss, make it back, if you get caught, bitch shut your trap

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
All my life
I've been waiting for your love
All those nights
I'd been lusting for your touch
Tell that bitch I need money
Bitch I need money
I need money
Bitch I need money
I need money
Bitch I need money
I need money
Tell that bitch I need money
Tell that bitch I need
Money make the mothafuckin' world go round
No, money make your mothafuckin' girl go downtown

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Riding 'round, I'm getting it, two chains on like I'm Tity
Versace shades like I'm Biggie, them twenties, fifties and benjis
These bitches all in my business, I mack 'em then I act stingy
I never slip with my pimping, when I holla come and get with me, huh?
Drizzy, huh? Swizzy, huh? Prada, Gucci and Fendi
Which only means you fancy, my trillest bitches is trendy
She tipsy off of that Crissy, my pimping never been friendly
She fell in love cause I'm pretty, she love me more than her family, huh?

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
All my life, I've been waiting for your love
All those nights, I'd been lusting for your touch
Tell that bitch I need money
Bitch I need money
I need money
Bitch I need money
I need money
Bitch I need money
I need money
Tell that bitch I need money
Tell that Bitch I need
Money make the mothafuckin' world go round
No, money make your mothafuckin' girl go downtown

[Verse 2: ASAP Ferg]
I need new Bape, grandpa need a toupee
Mama need some new weave, get her hair done with new braids
So bitch give me money, stop dicking around like you paid
Heated that grip like today, better hit that strip like today
Better hop in that whip with the coochie, then she lick dick to the new king
Them niggas be balling like 2K, better suck that dick 'til Tuesday
Better get them chips 'fore it's too late, it's a new bad bitch with a booty
Who sucking and fucking for Kool-Aid and keeping that pimp in a new Range (Oh, Lord)

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
All my life, I've been waiting for your love
All those nights, I'd been lusting for your touch
Tell that bitch I need money
Money make the mothafuckin' world go round
No, money make your mothafuckin' girl go downtown

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
What? I ain't tryna fuck, make her, make a buck
Every nigga in the world wanna live it up
Give it, give it up, trill bitch, don't give a fuck
And she get a pimp nigga like me, rich as fuck
