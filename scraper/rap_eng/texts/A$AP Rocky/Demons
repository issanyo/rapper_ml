$cott $immons:

Tell me we could have been something

But you was busy afraid

You was too busy worried about failing
You never know how it must felt

Talking about love and paradise

Talk about what was real
And what wasn't real

Talk about the impossible be possible

Tell what could you have feel

(Bridge)
Where would I go
What do I need
I really need you
Yeah
