[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
(Fuck the law)
As I maneuver through the streets
A policeman and then they seize bodies of those who disagree
(Like, fuck them all)
I pray the soldiers get release
The price of grief wasn't cheap
Hoped you kept to your receipts
Where there's beef
On the side of the feast, I'm a beast
Said it's me now, hold your peace
Don't hold your breath
Load your piece
And then squeeze
Then release
(Hail Mary)
Rest in peace
No relief
And that's why
The fucking martian to the fucking fucking, nigga

[Chorus: Tom Morello]
Well my devil won't let me out
Well my devil won't let me out
Well my devil won't let me out
Well my devil won't let me out
Well my devil won't–
Well my devil won't–
Well my devil won't–
Well my devil won't let me out

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Finger on the trigger
Pour the shot down
Now there's one less nigga
Hold up
(Fuck the world)
Including everybody in this bitch
I off 'em with my fingertips
And force apart his ligaments
Be sure to wipe your fingerprints
Restore back to your innocence
And reminiscing ever since you feel the sentencing before the sentence ended
I'm in the slums my nigga
Not just for bragging
I'm in the field my nigga
This shit for practice
This shit is trill my nigga
Kill or be killed my nigga
Cops is killing children
Get off, only get suspension
Man, this shit's suspicious
Consequences never in this
Fur these fucking pigs and dirty politicians
Dirty money, wash the business
It's them early birds that'll prolly get it
Pull up on you, shut up
Shut the fuck up
Learn how to run or mind your business

[Chorus: Tom Morello]
Well my devil won't–
Well my devil won't–
Well my devil won't–
Well my devil won't let me out
