//Verse 1//
Could've spent the whole night with that shit
Smoke in the car like clouds
Windows tinted 'cause we do it like that
And I don't care what you think, I'll think for you

//Pre-Chorus//
But I do what I do
You ain't used to
But I fuck with you like your boo used to fuck with me
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You ain't just through yet
And I'm gon' fuck with you like boo used to fuck with me

//Chorus//
She fuckin' with me, been fuckin' with me
Still fuckin with me, yeah, fuckin' with me
Oh, she fuckin' with me, been fuckin' with me
All thick, all pretty, she fuckin' with me like that

//Verse 2//
Could've love it but you knew that I was gonna quit it
Lying down with you in the summer
Wardrobe on the floor, catching feelings
Mood be so hot, turnin' me into a hot being
And I got a fetish for your thing

//Verse 3 (A$AP Rocky)//
Hold on, take a minute, love
'Cause I ain't trying to mess your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to mess your fitness up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, the signature
Any time I hit it, know she feelin' for it through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next chick
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot (Whoo!)
Just met a bad miss without the ass shots (Whoo!)
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good

//Pre-Chorus//
But I do what I do
You ain't used to
But I fuck with you like your boo used to fuck with me
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You ain't just through yet
And I'm gon' fuck with you like boo used to fuck with me

//Chorus//
She fuckin' with me, been fuckin' with me
Still fuckin with me, yeah, fuckin' with me
Oh, she fuckin' with me, been fuckin' with me
All thick, all pretty, she fuckin' with me like that

//Verse 4 (Gucci Mane)//
The way you talk
I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need me
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Water diamonds, Aquafina

//Chorus//
She fuckin' with me, been fuckin' with me
Still fuckin with me, yeah, fuckin' with me
Oh, she fuckin' with me, been fuckin' with me
All thick, all pretty, she fuckin' with me like that
She fuckin' with me, been fuckin' with me
Still fuckin with me, yeah, fuckin' with me
Oh, she fuckin' with me, been fuckin' with me
All thick, all pretty, she fuckin' with me like that
