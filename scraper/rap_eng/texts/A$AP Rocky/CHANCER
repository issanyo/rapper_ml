[Intro - A$AP Rocky]
Ay Dean, let these niggas know what the fuck is up
Only London nigga out here smoking blunts back to back like a fucking yankee nigga
To the front, ya heard?
Niggas wanna hate you when you down, they doubt you when you doin' it

[Verse - Dean Blunt & A$AP Rocky]
Do you know what’s going on tonight?
I just got a tin and it's alright
If you wanna see me then it's lit (it’s lit than a bitch)
You ain't got a problem getting in (Woo! Let's go!)
Say if you roll with me then it's alright (That's a'ight nigga. These niggas ain't got shit on you Dean, these niggas ain't ’bout shit nigga)
I ain’t even gotta try that hard
Hanging 'round with me you get a pass
They just wanna stop us getting rich
We ain’t gonna take no more of it
So if they gonna shoot they better hit, hit, hit (Hit nigga! Grrah! Grrah! Grrah! Grrah! Niggas ain't about shit. Fuck 'em!)
