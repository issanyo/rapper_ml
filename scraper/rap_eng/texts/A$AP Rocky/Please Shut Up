[Intro: KEY!]
Hey Franchise, you did it again
Yeah, yeah, yo
Ya know, new wave
New wave, nigga about to cap 'em
Yeah, ay, uh

[Chorus: KEY!]
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up

[Post-Chorus: KEY!]
Yeen ain't sayin' nothing, damn sure not money, ayy
Sick ass niggas, they finna vomit, hey
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh
Living room, full of way too many valuables
Old miss bad and boujee attitude like she from Baton Rouge
After school, made some revenue off that avenue
Not a morning person, can I hit it in the afternoon? (In the morning)
Woke up feelin' like the man, either Prada or the Vans
Make ya choose up on ya man, interceptin' all the plans
Benz truck, please shut up
VS'd up, teeth glitz'd up

[Chorus: KEY!]
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane and A$AP Rocky, I got such a rocky wrist
I was being humble, I'm back on my cocky shit (burr)
She was being stuck up, now she onto jockin' shit (huh)
I was at the bottom, but now on top of the list (Gucci)
From Harlem to the 6, let the ballers in this bitch
How you in the strip club ain't throwing dollars in this bitch?
See, we rollin' in money, and the dash do two hundred
Baby, shut the fuck up and you can have you some hundreds

[Chorus: KEY!]
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up

[Post-Chorus: KEY!]
Yeen ain't sayin' nothing, damn sure not money, ayy
Sick ass niggas, they finna vomit, hey
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up

[Verse 3: KEY!]
Uh, shut up, ayy, uh, shut up, ayy
I'm flexin' round this bitch I used to fuck though
7-7-7, hit my luck up
Gave you all this time, nigga what's up?
Hey, walk with friends tryin' to indict me
Damn, I wipe my hands up with lightnin'
Ayy, lame ass nigga just sight-seein'
AK got a scope, hey, when I'm sniping, whoa

[Chorus: KEY!]
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up

[Post-Chorus: KEY!]
Yeen ain't sayin' nothing, damn sure not money, ayy
Sick ass niggas, they finna vomit, hey
Please shut up, please shut up
Please shut up, please shut up

[Outro: KEY!]
Uh, shut up, ayy, uh, shut up, ayy
Uh, shut up, ayy, uh, shut up, ayy
Uh, shut up, ayy, uh, shut up, ayy
Uh, shut up, ayy, uh, shut up, ayy
