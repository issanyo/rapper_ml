[Intro: Tommy Wright III]
My man, Rico MDB in the house
My dog C-9 with the date
My dog TC over here, grinnin' all golden
And he finna come up
Pretty smart-

[Chorus: Devonté Hynes with Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you want from me

[Verse 1: Devonté Hynes]
Switchin' up your style, but you've waited too long
Funny until now so it's wrong
Pacing yourself, and racing yourself in the name of truth
What's true?

[Refrain: Devonté Hynes, *Tommy Wright III]
Brother, baby, we've seen it all
And we're tired, so what you want from me?
*Grinnin' all gold

[Chorus: Devonté Hynes with Kingpin Skinny Pimp]
Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you want from me
Tell me what you want from me

[Verse 2: Devonté Hynes]
Nothing can replace me if you're not taking my lead
Better to be broken than in need

[Refrain: Devonté Hynes]
Brother, baby, we've seen it all
And we're tired, uh, so what you want from me?

[Chorus: Devonté Hynes + Project Pat]
Tell me what you want from me
(What you want from me baby)
Tell me what you want from me (Grill on froze)
Tell me what you want from me (Want from me)
Tell me what you want from me

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
Lookin' for the chewin', for the jaw
Blowing like the time, word of mouth
Shawty told me that this world is ours
Selfish with that pussy like it's mine
Peppermint, double-mint, spearmint, type of shit
She the type of chick to get right on the dick
Ride on the dick, with no license and shit
No relatives, sentimental
It's detrimental, still compared to this relevance
She the type of chick to get right on the dick
Ride on the dick, with no license and shit, oh
Back and forth, wall to wall, use the jaw
Losin' drawers in the sauce, now
On the job, never off
That pussy got, won't let her off, and it's so good
Shout out my ex, though, she was the best though
Got on my damn nerves, hella fresh, though
I bought that Guess shirt
She had that mesh shirt, I turned it to a sweatshirt
Throw on that sweatshirt, she fuck with Earl, too
She fuck with girls, too, I fuck with her too
Tell her quit the chattin', jaws made for chewin'
If you fuckin' with me, bet you know what you're doin', like

[Outro: Project Pat, Tommy Wright III]
Vavet, get the new CD, 'Feel Me Before They Kill Me'
Right now Fear me in person
Buy Feel Me, Before They Kill Me! You heard me?

Patta, I like the dirty, dirty, I love to beat it, beat it
Tell her lies and and I promise whole lot of shit
She’ll never get, bend over let me hit
A North Memphis nigga bitch, he’s very slick
Ho, don’t beat a bih, and they see you break
That ho love a rich nigga, I got plenty cake
She get it like she do, cause she pretty freak
Pretty hate, I got choppas call me pretty Drake
Patta
