[Intro]
Now that's what I'm talking 'bout
DF to the A$AP Mob

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Lines – tell them read between it
Tripping while I'm slipping, busy fighting off these demons
Listen while I'm spitting boy, you probably won't believe it
But life is so terrific, tell them pinch me if I'm dreaming
Revenue's what I get, get; your bitch is what I did hit
And I'm 'bout my business, them pesos what I did get
Made a hit, had a fix, they saying you’s the shiznit
Tell them get off my diznick, you bucketheaded bitches
Crossing all the lines, time is only racing time
He flippin' to the bars so I'm only raising mine
Depending on the grind is the only way to shine
So I'm feeling like that odds is the only state of mind
And it's finna give me peace, life up in these streets
Equipped with a piece, case you niglets wanted beef
'Cause man gave us laws and God gave us time
It's the art of storytelling and I'm only telling mine

[Hook: Phantogram]
The lines we've crossed, the lines we crossed
Have always been why I've lost
It changes all the time
Cause I've wondered how (I've wondered how)
I’m happier when I lose what I’ve needed all my life
(Talk that shit Boi)

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Straight out of the belly of East Point, yeah that's my origins
Was born in West Savannah, Georgia then I was born again
Like the baby in the manger
I gave my life to Jésus because he could protect me from the dangers
In the circle of angels, just to help me shine my halo
Attended Sunday school but it felt like it was every day though
I didn't have a suit or no fancy shoes, we went in our play clothes
Received the word and it molded me like Play Doh
We don't play though - we don't play though
They say we get lower than an alligator's navel
And when I say gator I mean that gator that match that sable, fur coat
I wish that PETA would throw some blood off on my fur, folk
Boy - ass whoopin'
They out'chea eating flesh but wanna worry how I'm looking
I stay simply fresh to death, Sir Luscious Left Foot, best foot forward
You reap what you sow, and now it's showing

[Hook]
