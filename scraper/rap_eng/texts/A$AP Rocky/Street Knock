[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
God Dammit!
Ay, Right
Ay, Right
Ay, Right
Listen..

[Verse 1: Swizz Beatz]
Ridin' around in my Lotus, sitting back and I'm focused
On that west side - hocus pocus
Nigga see them pipes, coming out at night
Niggas acting crazy, we don't really fight
Hit back with them hammers, watch out for them cameras
Niggas coming through, popo put you in them slammers
I ain't got no time, I ain't doin' no crime
Why you're talking to me, I ain't' dropping no dime
Sitting back in my shirt, Givenchy on my back
Sitting in the mid of Yonkers, bringing the Dog back
L O X is here, we back up in here
Yeah Double R here we come to share
We back and I'm chillin, came back and I'm healing
Niggas talking crazy then make a killing
Took over them companies, took over dem trees
Kept them in my flight, passport over seas

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Shhh...
Hey, right
1212, right, 1212, right
Right yeah

[Verse 2: A$AP ROCKY]
God damn it I'm a genius, swagga is the meanest
Weird green hair chicks from venus on my penis
Twisting up our fingers, you know who my team is
Starch em up and fold em then we treat them like them cleaners
Used to push the Jag stolen tags, scrape the serial
Mouth rose, top row full of gold material
88 back bass bumping through your stereo
Chicken noodle soup and mixing soda with the cereal
White like milk got beige like a Cheerio
Pancakes and purple syrup and my breakfast is complete
New Black Scale shit that complement that fleece
Reeboks red-bottoms straight from Swizzy on my feet
We some billionaire boy in some Billionaire Boys Club
Plus probably push a 'Gatti that's the billionaire's toy huh
Whoa kimosabe I’m in Junya Watanabe
Murakami or Versace and Givenchy on your boy, huh?

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Bitch
Hey, right
1212, right, 1212, right
Right yeah
God Dammit!

[Verse 3: Swizz Beatz]
Haters they can't stop me listen to ASAP Rocky
Walk into the club and bitches say I'm cocky
Walkin' through the club and bitches say I'm cocky
Walkin' through the club and bitches say I'm cocky
Chill back when I'm laid back, sit back and I'm way back
Everybody better stay back, bitch don't say that
Back Back and I’m business, came back and I’m kicks it
Niggas wanna… can I get a witness?
Shit man I’m on fly, 'bout to rule the sky
Basquiats on my wall, Goddamn I'm fly
Keith Harings and all that, Picassos and all that
Rembrandts you name it, bitch I got all that
Wrapped around my skrilla, came back and I’m illa
Bitch asked me my color, I told that bitch VDammit
God damn it!

[Hook]
Back on one
Back on one
