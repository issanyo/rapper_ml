What's beef? Beef is when you make ya enemies start the Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 20 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, motherfucker
What's beef? Beef is when you make ya enemies start the Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 20 deep
Beef is when I see you
Guaranteed to be in ICU, motherfucker

[Verse 1]
Nowadays it's silly, niggas beef for nothing
The type of shit that make the hippies throw up peace for nothing
Back in my day, there wasn't silencers to hide the 8 up
So if it's beef, be sure to order side of baked potato
I've got amigos on my payroll, Quavo gave me guelo
Fuego, beef up on my plate is no mistake
Hahahahaha, check out the Chopard
For sure, I'm Shakur out the window of my car
Spitting at the cameras and I flood the club with dancers
I used to roll with hammers back when Sway had all the answers
Now it's spread like cancers in this German
And these niggas want me gone for certain
And that's what I call beef, you vermin

[Hook]
What's beef? Beef is when you make ya enemies start the Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 20 deep

Guaranteed to be in ICU, motherfucker
What's beef? Beef is when you make ya enemies start the Jeep
Beef is when you roll no less than 20 deep
Beef is when I see you

[Verse 2]
Uh, Puffy swag combs, call me Sherlock Stallone
Daddy NASDAQ or call me Puffy Dow Jones
Come fuck with Puffy, dirty money since the scruffy Puffy
They want me bloody, hungry, ugly, crusty, musty Puffy
See that motherfucking phantom? Then it must be Puffy
It's like lately, all the ladies say is "fuck me, Puffy"
80 million records was projected
My leverage breaking records, it's like 80 women naked
Hectic, paranoia got me feeling threatened
So I'm loading up my weapons up like every other second
