[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Pretty motherfucker with the mossberg
Jiggy motherfucker at my concerts
I'm wearin' fox furs, rockin' oxfords
Eatin' oxtails, sippin' Cockspur
Silly motherfuckers lookin' awkward
So much dick ridin' that my cock hurt
(Pause), we runnin' clockwork
So we got purp, and we got work
Tell Ri-Ri I go re-retarded
On a remix had to re-record it
On a CD, DVD, and TV, MP3 come see me for it
I go cuckoo for your coucou
Your flying fish is my favorite dish
Won't hear crickets when I crick it
Hit it play games like soccer when we kick it
Get it?

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant
(Youuuuuu)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

[Hook: Rihanna]
Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words
And then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
I want you to be my sex slave
Anything that I desire
Be one with my femin-ay
Set my whole body on fire
They mad at Rihanna game
Taking over your empire
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant
(Youuuuuu)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

[Hook: Rihanna]
Suck my cockiness
Lick my persuasion
Eat my words
And then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs
Over your resistance
And then you come around
You come around
You come around

[Verse 3: Rihanna]
I can be your dominatrix
Just submit to my every order
Enter my diamond matrix
If you want my golden flower
Make me your priority
There's nothing above my pleasure
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'm gonna be the queen of your body parts

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant
(Youuuuuuuu)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it

[Verse 4: Rihanna]
Hold it down, beat it like a bully
Beat my drum drum
Like a drum line boogie
(I love it when you)
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body
Hold me tight mister lover
(I love it when you)
Do it like I do it
Like I said
Keep it up, boy
We can do this all day
Be my Harlem
And me St. Tropez
Never found nobody
That will do it this way

[Pre-Hook: Rihanna]
No one can do ya
The way that I do
Boy I wa-a-ant
(Youuuuuu)
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it
