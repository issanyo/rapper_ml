[Verse 1: Raury]
I know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm riding around
And my system bumping LSD
I look for ways to say I love you
But I ain't into making love songs
Baby, I'm just rapping to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We made love under pretty lights, LSD
Get a feeling it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, you know I really want love, sex, dreams

[Chorus]
Party just started up
Dreams sharing love
Tongue at a lost for words
Cuz my feelings just set it off
Party just started up
Dreams sharing love
Feelings for way too long
Said I really want to let it go
Said I really want to let it go
Said I really want to let it go
Said I really want to let it go

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we was up in the mountains
Five or ten days
Man I wasn't really counting
Sipping on the shroom tea
I was never innocent
Living it
Baby, can I smash
Count the pocket
I'm a nigga on a mission
I'm not here because of talent
Young and reckless, too
Keep it on a balance
Baby, you was tripping
Now I'm reminiscing
About a week in Utah
When we went cow-tipping
The prettiest thing that I ever seen
Didn't know that you had a thing for the morphine
The morphine
Remember what you told me cuz you promised?
Ain't heard from you in months
I hate you to be honest
And now every single love song that I hear
Can make me vomit
And I really want to see you
Your presence is a comet
Just a streak of beauty
See how you do me?
And now my crew be thinking that I'm cooky
When you did this to me
Now I'm through we
Can't end it smoothly
Go see your groupies
While I roll another doobie
Headed to the movies
Please excuse me
Yeah, please excuse me
