[Verse]
Feeling outta place, plus it's getting kinda late
Tryna make it home safe and not get raped, where you live?
Tina tummy ache, Gina got the funny face
Mona's sniffing dope, so her dome is leaning on your rib
I bet you wish you had a Benz cause you just helped your friends
Flag a taxi, now you walking not too far from your crib
Craving for an acid tablet for your satisfaction
Said you feeling flabbergasted, you just had to have it
Made your way to 7th Ave, flagged a yellow cab
Now you need an upper fast to help your mellow swag
Black kid, french braids and he keep the potent
Hold ya purse don't trust him cause his teeth is golden
Dice rolling reefer blowing in the streets he smoking
Blowing weed while police patrolling
Acid strips, purple drink you can have a sip
Have a fix of this acid drip

[Chorus]
Hands on her thighs, kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip
Hands on her thighs, kiss on the lips
Eye for an eye, drip for a drip
I get ya high, please don't forget
I can supply the fix for ya trip
