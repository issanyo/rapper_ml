Would you ride without a license, nigga?
Would you live with all your vices, nigga?
Would you die with the ISIS, nigga?

[Verse 17: Kirk Knight]

One big room, full of mad goons
Hella broads at the bar
You actin' hard, get dealt with the squad

[Verse 22: Kirk Knight, Nyck Caution, A$AP Twelvyy and Zombie Juice]
