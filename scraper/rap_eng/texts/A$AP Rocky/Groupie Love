[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
You're in the bar, playin' guitar
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with the star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club, livin' it up
I'm tryin' not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet, swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time you look up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Time after time, writin' my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me
It's so sweet, pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Takin' our dreams, turnin' them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinkin' of
I know what you're thinkin' of

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
You want my
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Lana Del Rey]
Front row, every show like a hype man (hmm)
Sing along word for word, watchin' my bae (yeah)
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade (hmm, hmm)
God dang, got a nigga actin' irate (hmm, hmm)
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain (yeah)
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love (hmm)
We don't pay no minds to the thug with a... (hmm)
Love girls, you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die (You and I 'til the day we die)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey & A$AP Rocky]
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
You are my babe
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
Groupie love
