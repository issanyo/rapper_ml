[Intro: ASAP Rocky]
Yo, A$AP here
We 'bout to kill a fucking game
You know who the fuck we are
You know my motherfucking name
I fucked your dame
And she bought me a chain
And a Range
And a pinky ring, that blinga, bling
And all my niggas here, they about to kill this shit
Whatchu  say Nast?

[Verse 1: ASAP Nast]
Yo
I say hold up dawg
Nast in this bitch again sipping Hen
Staring at that white girl from michigan
She was with her friends, fat ass fly ho
I went in for the kill ASAP, pronto
Said wait boo, 'fore we hit ya condo
I got another friend wit me named Whitney from Chicago
Whitney love to model, I'm thinking Menage flow
The truck parked up front, the chevvy get Tahoe
Haters all in my face, can't see blindfold
Dons on my feet, blue-ripe bye folks
Nuttin on sucker niggas is what I was designed for
Dead fresh fresh 2 death, I shouldda' designed clothes
But I'm blessing these tracks, sick flow, swine flu
Ya'll ain't fucking with Nast I been nice, ya'll know
Haha, nigga that shit times two
I'm who ya bitches wanna kick it with, Kung Fu
Well what dawg what is you saying
Nast in this bitch, ho why's you playing
Like I won't slay this, stage, on some cage shit
Turn into a mayhem, beat tough, flow hurting
Cali Swag bitch snapback no jerking
Flows perfect, money in hands, hoes know this
Fast forward, past focus, I'm that on it
One of the best to do it, think not, bet on it
Giant Nast you be lumberjack paul bunyan
Hoes love it, never put none above it
Wanna hug me tightter than jeans ass sportin'
Carry coffin to cemeteries that very often
Sports fortune, matchboxes, its that awesome

[Spaceghostpurrp Extra verse}â€‹
It's the motherfucking phonk
Fuck wit me, I'll leave the AK out the trunk
Understand what's going on in the place to be
Nigga S.G.P, understand its the real
When I keep it real, come thru With
The motherfucking steel
Still, I speak how I feel every time
And when I do, I kick a phonk-y ass rhyme
If your fucking around with my brothas
I'll put the slug to your mother
Motherfucker you a sucka
Bitch ass nigga

[Verse 2: Spaceghostpurrp]
So what I say, motherfucker
Already know i've never beena sucker
See I lust ya, I want ya, bavby come home baby girl
Whats your name Wonda do you wanna be up on me
Do you wanna bend over, do you feel horny
Do you wanna feel a stroke, it's kinnda like Facebook
When you feel a poke
A$AP no joke Raider Klan all back and we aiming at ya throat

[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]
I wanna rock, but the bitches want me tho
D&G briefs, fit a nigga like speedo
Skinny nudie jeans tho, boots be 40 below
He flow a huunnid degrees the jelws zero
Rockstar Rock, he reps guitar hero
Leopard Louboutins like speedos on Stev-O
Charge it to the game couldn't pause me on Tivo
Beyonce to Kanye I got a big ego
On to that next shit, you looking at the bestest
Married to the game treat you niggas like my stepkids
Pull up in Porsche, niggas getting nausia
Didn't write the rules but my status like an author
Just crashed the Range, so I pulled the Bent out
Probably getting brains, chilling in the Penthouse
Slaging on you maggin, and I'm bout to lay my pimp down
Christian Louboutin red bottoms come in mens now
On to the next one, skinny jeans fit in
Pull up to these shows, and the hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
Little do she know i got a big ego
Automatic weapon, need to order a protection
Killing feelings, on these records
So my charges is molesting and assault with deadly weapon got these rappers feeling threatened
A hip-hop veteran
I'm a hip-hop felon

[Verse 4: ASAP Twelvy]
It's a war going on outside and we started it
Belive that or die nigga on some martry shit
All my niggas on the scene like some Sparta shit
And we came to double up on that Harlem shit
We all eating, this is how it supposed to go
Stop speaking, this is how you 'posed to flow
The ins-and-out of a winners route
I never lose again, its like evryday i lose a friend
To some dumb shit, for a dumb bitch
So a hating nigga for a cuff wrist
I know a lot of niggas sitting in a cell now
For the shit i've done I'm prolly even hell-bound
But it's cool with me, jacking niggas jewlry
I don't give a fuck about your foolery
Nigga keep a tool with me, Just to blast atcha bitches
Long as I'm at the top, and our rags to the riches

A$AP nigga

[Verse 5: ASAP Ferg]
On my Pokemon shit, you already know

I said, I said

He gon give it to me, Becky gettin top above it all
She give it to me in a Jet, purple lable sweats
I swear to God I'm rich
And once I swearve these many bitches

And I'm smart like a nerd

See my bitch ride that big thang, you on that little shit
Trying to make noise, you squeaking like a little pit
Put her into that dawg my attitudes a little Vick

[Verse 6: ASAP Rocky]

Uhhh, Thats how my niggas fall back
A$AP Raider Klan and we all blacked out
Tell that bitch get it mapped out
And I fucked a bitch, now she flat out
Chest out, on the fucking floor never hit it raw
Got a condoment, got a towel by the door
Just in case the smoke go in to the hallway
Cause I be smoking weed and fucking all day
This is off the top of the dome, let me introduce my niggas
Before a nigga go home
We got TY Beats, the illest producer in these streets
So you know we coming through with that Motherfuckign heat
Got Twelvy, motherfucker twelvy, got a bad bitch Jewish named Shelby
Got my nigga Nast in the back, got a snapback
To the back he don't know how to act
Got my nigga named Purrp, Spaceghostpurrp, do ya bitch real dirt That's dirty, little flirty, fucked a bitch named Purdy, did her dirty
