[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Young man, brotha brotha, you gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', gotta understand, gotta make the plays
Stick to it, get through, write yours, ride your wave, just keep it true
We'll fight the blues, we'll fight the blues
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha man, brotha man
You gotta fight for somethin', stand for somethin'
That's what the poem told me
It was a greater poet like you know it but
I'd rather talk about how my neck is frozen and I
I'd write a song about the banging hoes and then
Stay up in the bitches while she dozing

[Chorus: French Montana]
When I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', "Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (come back) come back (come back)
Come back (come back) babe"

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & Snoop Dogg]
Harlem nights, quick speed, Godspeed
Speed of light, Grease Lightnin', leather on my six-speed bike
Bicycle tires, icicle diamonds, popsicle stripes
Pop (sicles) pop (sicles) for the Klondikes
Pop-pop wheelies on the dirty bikes, 15 sellin' China white
Cops stoppin' if you opposite of white
Pop, pop like you opposite of right
Take heed, lil' nigga, lowkey, take lead on them niggas

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky & Frank Ocean]
Smooth dude riding 'round the boulevard
Back in the days was on the train
Ride the bus before I ride another nigga wave
Beautiful, the water's flat like ass is pre-Onika (yeah)
You the smaller version, you the baby sneaker

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Flacko, I wonder how it feel to live or be like you
Album number three and keep it G like Q
Heard you niggas get fly like G, like 2
Nah, more like 4, like 3, not 2
Shittin' on these niggas like P, like U
Drip Raheem and Q, got Hi-C like juice
Mama hubby got life, he got three strikes too
Real niggas bleed like me, like you
That's why I got a beam with a green light too
I don't even make a scene, I just swing right through
I'm just stayin' on my Qs and my Ps like soup
Walkin' in my shoes, follow me like suit

[Pre-Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Brotha man, young man, let me tell you somethin'
Young man, brotha-brotha, gotta fight for somethin'
Stand for somethin', brotha understand, God don't make the plays
Take the truth, get through, ride your wave, just keep the truth

[Chorus: French Montana & Frank Ocean]
Remember when I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"
Now we hop out the PJs, posted by the P
My old bitch yellin', "Come back, come back
Come back, babe
Come back (come back) come back (come back)
Come back (come back) babe"

[Outro: Frank Ocean]
You're a cornstar, all you fuck is corn broads (you fucking pop)
Frenchie faux pas 'cause you ain't had no pa
Your deal got catches like an outfielder
(Are you, are you, are you?)
Getting that God's view from towers
Lookin' downward like I'm Donald Trump
