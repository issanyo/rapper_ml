D-D-D-DJ Nick exclusive

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
I'm geekin', I'm wildin', I'm tripping
That .40 be talking, I be limping
Gotta be focused on the mission (uh)
Gotta be focused on millions
Niggas be talkin', they dissin'
They mad cause they bitch in my mentions
Walkin' in Prada, I'm spendin'
Walk up in Prada, I'm spendin'

[Chorus: A$AP Ant]
My diamonds on bling
I'm feelin' like Cam'ron rockin' all pink
My diamonds all wet
My diamonds, they drippy, they just like a lake
Can't talk about money don't conversate
My niggas be raisin' the crime rate
Tryna be wealthy like Bill Gates

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, I just hit a lick with no lickin' (DJ Nick)
Who got all the chicks and the chicken?
I wipe off her cheek when you missin'
Swipe her right off her feet when you slippin'
Wipe off your feet when you visit
Big home, like I'm big bone
Beat my chest, King Kong
Pinky ring her finger on
I'm good with the lean and prescriptions
Go be with the geek when you trippin'
I tuck in my tee, I mean business
I studded in my teeths, I mean business
You fuck with my team that's a death wish
Don't fuck with my weed or my bitches
Don't come for my queen or my empress
Don't touch on the weave or extensions

[Chorus: A$AP Ant]
My diamonds on bling
I'm feelin' like Cam'ron rockin' all pink
My diamonds all wet
My diamonds, they drippy, they just like a lake
Can't talk about money don't conversate
My niggas be raisin' the crime rate
Tryna be wealthy like Bill Gates
My diamonds on bling
I'm feelin' like Cam'ron rockin' all pink
My diamonds all wet
My diamonds, they drippy, they just like a lake
Can't talk about money don't conversate
My niggas be raisin' the crime rate
Tryna be wealthy like Bill Gates
