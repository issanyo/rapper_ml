[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Woah, woah, yo
Woah, woah, woah

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & Key!]
I got a lot on my head
Gucci rag tied on my head
Put a red dot on your head
I put that guap on your head
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
I got a lot on my mind
I put that guap on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I put that nine to your mind
Don't talk to me brazy
Don't talk to me brazy
Don't talk to me brazy
Don't talk to me brazy

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & Key!]
I don't want no conversation
I don't need explanation
Shoot with no hesitation
They do it for a reputation
They don't play me on the station
Press 'em like detonation
More Margiela than a Mason
Man I'm Rocky like a caveman
Re-rock I'm a rockstar
Try to cuff me like a cop car
Try to play me like a pop star?
That's how you get not far
All my Cuz niggas crazy
All my Blood niggas brazy
Might just drop in on a Wednesday
Man the shit is soundin' wavy
Don't talk back, just give me face
I got nines on my waist
Hide them nines in the place, I don't care
I'm with Flacko, you on flocka
You got guns, but won't pop 'em
I send niggas to the doctor, I don't care
Xanman, tan money bag, drag, slash bag man
Baghdad land
Talk back, get back slapped with a back hand
Black man, black hand side
Anti-everything since Yams died
And I stand by NY
No who, what, where, why, when

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & Key!]
I got a lot on my head
Gucci rag tied on my head
Put a red dot on your head
I put that guap on your head
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
I got a lot on my mind
I put that guap on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I put that nine to your mind
Don't talk to me brazy
Don't talk to me brazy
Don't talk to me brazy
Don't talk to me brazy

[Verse 2: A$AP Twelvvy]
Hundred thousand dollar nightmare
If I wanna take a flight there
Man fuck it spend a life here
Young thuggin in some Nike Airs
Bicken Back Being Bool, baby
Layin' back by the pool, baby
Bumpin' that shit too wavy
Counting stacks shit too brazy
Walk around with a bag on me
Walk around with a flag on me
Bickin back I got mad hoes
Joey Fatts might blast for me
Tote the Tecs I got cash homie
Take it back, I got crack on me
This and that, got that on me
Where you from?
Where you at homie?

[Hook: A$AP Rocky & Key!]
I got a lot on my head
Gucci rag tied on my head
Put a red dot on your head
I put that guap on your head
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
Don't be talking to me crazy
I got a lot on my mind
I put that guap on my mind
I got a lot on my mind
I put that nine to your mind
Don't talk to me brazy
Don't talk to me brazy
Don't talk to me brazy
Don't talk to me brazy
