[Intro]
You know what I'm saying?
Still that nigga man, Yeah the lord's back
Know what I'm saying, they say pearls are for a pretty boy
Shout outs my nigga G-Herbo, my nigga Lil Uzi Vert one time
Shout out Three Six Mafia

[Verse]
I don't play like your parents' son
Thought I made that apparent
That's a hundred for a 'Claren or something
'nother hundred for a parison
Race Tyler, the McLaren
Drive 'Raris like Ferris, huh
Cop my Karats from Carring dammit
Make a bitch wanna stare or something
Niggas stare, you queer or somethin'?
You's a bitch, yeah we stay done
Chose a whip but I'm staying sunny
Diamonds sunny like I'm Cher or something
Smiley faces with the glasses
Fashion brands invite you to Paris
Boy you late that's a demerit, dang it
Get fucking maggot brain having
Rappers claiming the trap and the fashion
They only got Louis and the trap
I'm causing the flood and the traffic
The way that you be moving is whack
All of them rumors is facts
They've been in clap for the clap back
Your baby mama a nag nag
Nag nag nag nag nag nag

[Chorus]
Who run it? Who run it?
New money blue hundreds
Two hundred, on the dash
Bastard life, who run it?
Catch a blue hundred
I do run it, I do run it
I do run it, I do run it
