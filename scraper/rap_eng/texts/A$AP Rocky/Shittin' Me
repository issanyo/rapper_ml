Lyrics from Snippet

[Intro]
Woo
Smacked the shit out your bitch ass midget girlfriend, nigga (Haha)
Shittin' me?

[Chorus]
Shittin' me?
Gotta be kidding me
How could you shit on me?
You ain't got shit on me
Shittin' me?
Gotta be kidding me
How could you shit on me?
You ain't got shit on me

[Verse 1]
Why they choose my pubes everytime they wanna sit? (Sit)
Couldn't ride the wave and now you ridin' dick (Dick)
These bitches got no chances, they rely on dick (Dick)
Show them how to tip (Is you shittin' me? Haha)
Ride around town on a [?]
Louis belt got the check
A nigga gon' die on this
A shordy gon' ride on this
Rep the set, I ride on this
Take 'em by the leg
I been feelin' like I could shit
And a nigga still bump his shit? (Rep the set motherfucker)
The state was mines, fade on my mind
I say to myself, "Motion"
I stay on yo' mind, I stay in yo' mouth
You stay and you loud
[?], I need a new [?]
Jump in the crowd, ohâ€”
