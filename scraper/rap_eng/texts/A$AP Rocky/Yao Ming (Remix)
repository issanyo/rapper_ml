[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Ha, I'm a king, yes, I'm a don, nigga, what you want?
And I'm off two Jagerbombs and I'm your daddy 'cause I pay your mom
And it's hard to hate on niggas, when you the most hated on
You know what, I don't give a fuck 'cause your girl's pussy's my cologne
And she's on my private jet, she says she wanna try that mile high
Jungle better be shaved 'cause I ain't fucking wildlife
And she's smokin' loud right, can you hear me now?
But she still be super high when my plane be touchin' down
Can't tell me stop it 'cause I'm gon' cop it, anythin' you got my goons gon' rob it
Nigga, it's my time and you can't clock it and I'm throwin' racks, tell that girl pop it
And she the best dancer, goin' hammer and this new girl way better
What's my name? You know the answer, who did the beat? David-David Banner

[Chorus: David Banner]
And bitch, I'm tall as Yao Ming
And bitch, I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy, Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy

[Verse 2: David Banner]
It's all about my business, start collectin' interest
Fill my own wishlist so everyday it's Christmas
I don't have no time to wait, I need my money with the quickness
Ain't nothin' like that fast money, can I get a witness?
They say that I've been gone, now say what you mean
Bitch, if I fell off, I landed on the movie screen
They think I'm off the scene, but it ain't what it seems
They wonder why my self-esteem is tall as Yao Ming
My money comin' in, that shit comin' out
You can gon' bump your guns, I put this pistol in your mouth
Mississippi motherfucker, hoe, I'm from the south
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money, bitch, don't open up your mouth, mouth

[Chorus: David Banner]
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch, I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch, I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy

[Verse 3: ASAP Rocky]
It's Mr. Pretty Mother Mother, bitch, I am the trill man
Spit that gangsta boogie, amazon, they still dance
Them raiders be like haters, we the trill clan, no the real clan
Think where you got your style from, you niggas old as my lil man
'Cause I'm ready to go, she next to blow, like her fat ass, baby flexible
Got a gallery with collectibles, I pay my taxes, eat my vegetables
I'm Texas throwed, my necklace gold, keep a bad bitch, couple naked hoes
A couple of deals with no records sold, that comma-comma decimal
Grippin' and spitting'that tech, come for respect, trippin', I'm flippin' your neck
All on my set when I'm pitchin' and flippin' that wet then the dealer's feelin' a threat
Shawty dancin', got a whole lot of ass on her
If she don't like a jiggy nigga, I'ma pass on her
I said I'm off of the hook, she open off of my looks
I got her braidin' my hair, I got her rollin' my kush
I told her I am a crook because her heart's what I took
Holla if you need a job, lil mama, it's off of the books

[Chorus: David Banner]
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch, I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch, I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
