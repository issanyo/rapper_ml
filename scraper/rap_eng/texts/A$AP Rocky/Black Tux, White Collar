[Intro: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
Know what I'm sayin'
Got jealous of a nigga or something tryna...
Check it, whole lot of jewelry, my time nigga
Tryna surpass me, real shit
Don't do all that talking nigga
Clams Casino, nigga, A$AP
A$AP nigga, fuck you talkin' 'bout?
Meet me at the finish line you dig
Pew

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
I say motherfuck you niggas for the hate that you investin' (yeah)
Fuck police 'cause he probably wanna arrest me (check it out)
Fuck the prison system, this injustice was ingestive (slatt)
All black tuxes, get the white collars jealous like
All my role models either dead or in the pen'
I had no choice to be the nigga that I am
Stuck with bros, stuck the code (yeah)
'Cede emblem on the fender (yeah)
Couple fans in the hood I got no choice but to vent
Going in front to back, at events, fuckin' packed
With the hits back to back, Where the gas, roll the Back
Gold on gold, platinum plaques (uh)
On the road after that  (yeah)
She on a pole on a roll, make it clap, bring it back (hold up)
Real bitches where you at? Real niggas where you at?
Makin' niggas send a couple, real niggas where you at though?
How could I not be negative when I don't trust my relatives?
Niggas want settlements and bitches want like seven kids

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
Fuck fake people, I'ma go ahead and address it (fuck 'em)
Fuck you too just because you never said it (yeah)
God hate evil, you just blowin' all your blessings
Black tux, white collar formal on the wedding (yeah)

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
Time to divorce (time to divorce)
Line up the courts (line up the courts)
Tuxedo, don't try to support them
Don try to support them
When it start to go off
Come fuck with your boy (yeah)

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
I'ma shine through it all
Shine and all
Takeoff, lightyear
Shootin' star
Shine and all, shine and
All

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
To the cathedral, tux like I'm married (tux on like I'm married)
Don't got a ring on but it feel like I'm married (ring on my finger)
To the cathedral, tux like I'm married (like I'm married)
Know when that ring involved, know that it married (yeah)
Fuck views and opinions
I'm willin' to die, seemin' to shake off the image
But when I'm inside, pretendin' to smile
I feel the same high from the vengeance
I mean, I know we're both grown, like who are we kiddin'?
Goodbye to the crack way
The picket fences, kids in the kitchen
'Cause in this world, I feel lost
I'm feelin' trapped in my thoughts (yeah)
I don't know who to trust, just got my word and my balls (yeah, yeah)
This is hell and a ho
I know this the life that we chose
But lovin' the life that we livin'
We'll make it in the beginnin'
Save me the tux
Save me the tux for the endin'
Endin'
