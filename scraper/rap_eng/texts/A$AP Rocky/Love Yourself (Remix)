[Intro: Mary J. Blige]
It's been a long ride, but I made it here with love
I made it here with love, love
Said I've been and up and down and I've been through it all
Took a while to know my heart
Oh, yes, it has, yeah
Before a love like this, you go
Through the fire and valley lows
But if you just hold on
Please hold on 'cause love is strong, it'll save ya
Oh, please hold on, it'll save ya, save ya

[Verse 1: Mary J. Blige]
Truth can be the sweetest pain
It can mess up everything
It's the only way you know
I'm payin' for it, I'm changin' for it
Oh, oh, and it hurts
But I'll make it work
'Cause I'm no beginner
I'm a winner, paid dues, I know my purpose

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds, I'm movin' past you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Murder for hire, I require finer taste
Light the stage, setting fire to the whole Empire State
Marmalade, niggas toast, andal√©, I'm finna ghost
Bought a Wraith and a ghost, parked it where my mama stay
By the way, did I mention all the thots up in my mentions
Do a lot to gain attention? But I'm sure they'll find a way
Bigger business raising stakes, charging with a higher rate
Never mention competition, I just go annihilate
Roll a J, Mary Jane, actually that's Mary J
I'm fornicating with some twins like Ashley and Mary-Kate
Oh my days! Anyways, goodness sakes, her first mistake
Riding like I'm missing brakes, temporary rented plates
Just made it to my dinner date, bow your head, say your grace
Look my savior in his face
Gunning hundred miles per hour, catch you by the interstate
Told you boys it wasn't safe, give me peace, give me space
At the very least, at least just give me peace of mind to think

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else

[Verse 3: Mary J. Blige]
I don't feel no ways tired
Can't get restless in my soul
Hold your heart, the world is cold
Keep singin', don't you stop prayin', woman
Yeah, it will come to pass
Don't worry 'bout nothin'
God knows that you're worth it
You deserve it, can't nothin' else hurt you

[Refrain: Mary J. Blige]
Thought they'd put my life on hold
But I knew somethin' they didn't know
I know myself too much to ever fold
Dark clouds are movin' past you

[Chorus: Mary J. Blige]
Oh, you gotta love yourself, oh yeah
If you really wanna be with someone else
You gotta feed yourself
Before you feed somebody else
You gotta stay open, and don't be foolish
'Cause everybody don't mean you well
You gotta love yourself
You gotta love yourself
Before you love somebody else
Somebody else
