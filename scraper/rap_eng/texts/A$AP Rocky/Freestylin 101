A$AP ROCKY FREESTYLE

Don't do this

Cuz his jewels is
Gleaming and they blinging
And i know you used to it cuz
Real motherfuckers in the festival
And You know I'm probably smoking on that method cal
But I'm like mystikal
Everything is technical
And you know they didn't love but they checking now
Check the style

You know I did it and I kick it like I'm from the soccer
I never did it proper only got a problem take you to my casa
You dont want it cuz Rocky Flacko got the jabba jabba hit em

KOSHA DILLZ FREESTYLE

A couple raps dont make sense
From Jerz to White Plains to the City of Harlem
Um um ahem
Yeah my rap still
I'm in Spain
Eating the flan still
While exiles nice in the flannel man chill
Ok lookie for rookie
We rock everything from fairfax bear trap to Stussy
And my people understand when they stackin the Yen
Rahway Israel Norway to the Eurcokeennes
If it dont make sense i head out scenes like a fetus
Open it up two door cinema club
Get into bruh ,  Phoenix
Ya girl friend dont pray to Jesus
I separate it like a seamstress
Yeah and its the answers
You just white tee shirt gangsta
And crowds see us and they gonna  throw hands up
Doctors see us and they gonna go cure cancer
And uh real thugs gonna pull they pants up
Yeah  what - understand thats ratchet
But this ain't rap shit this is just nice denim jackets
And hands in pockets for profits when we rock sick
A$AP and Matis yo you got this!
