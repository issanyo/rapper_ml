[Intro]
Aw man J Scott why don't you drop that trill ish
[Verse 1]
I got some bad news this morning
I can't sing for ish ya'll
Which in turn made my day, yeah
When this someone spoke I listened, yeah
All of a sudden has less and less to say, all right
Oh how could this be
All this time
I lived vicariously
I can't sing for ish

[Chorus]
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
I wonder if I live to grow old now?
Getting high 'cause I feel so low now
Lemme freestyle

[Verse 2]
It made me feel like somebody
Like somebody else, yeah
Although we were imitated often
Felt like I was being myself
Oh, how could this be?
All of this time I had to keep this shit G
Pardon my language, I'm sorry y'all
Who's gonna save my dro now?
Who's gonna blaze my smoke now?
I wonder if I'll be pretty forever ya'll
Feeling high now I feel so low down

[Verse 3]
I need the marijuana where the trees, leave the trees
You're chillin' in the Live Lounge and you with me
A-S-A-P, got a hat to the back
And it's white 'cause I got a white collar shirt to match
Got a blue trench, chickens on my *ahh
Never gave her up, 'cause the clock won't tick
If my, ,don't stick, all up in your chicken
Everybody know me, I'm here take your flexin
And I love the UK, shoot at yo toupee
Riding round, Chicago like Lupe
And it's a Fiasco, your man is an asshole
And I could get busy but they dizzy like Rascal
And this is off the top, when I'm chillin' in the Live Lounge
You already know, ain't steppin' in the spot now
I gotta come, shut it down, up in Londontown
I need to beat the loop man, I need another round
Oh, how could this be?
I feel like whining when I'm singin
I live vicariously
Ya'll ready?

[Outro]
Who's gonna save my hoes now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
I wonder if I live to grow old now
They say I move back so I gotta slow down
I hope ya'll liked that right there
