[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance turn this shit into a nightclub

[Verse 1: MoneyatMidnight]
Fuck with me let's get some money
I said he fuck me then he got served
Engine loud and hot (swerve)
Pulling right the lot
Hit the gas I don't got no limit
New Wraith and you know it's tinted
Fuck stop signs, I can never be stopped
Even though I think blue lights that's the cops
When he pulled his pants down, damn it's long as a mop
Drop it the top let it breathe
Bought yo girlfriend some new weave
I know you broke and you stuggling
But you could be out here hustling
The chain I'ma get it custom
Tried to run up and I had to bust' em
Shout out to my Cardi B's in the streets
Out here getting this shmoney
Fuck them haters bitch you run it
Body froze it snowin' make that money if you hoe'n
Master P I don't got no limit, bout it bout, and I'm winning
Fuck you hating ass niggas
Cause you know you in your feelings
MoneyatMidnight don't got no limit
ShadesGang you know we winning

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
If I hit it one time, I'ma pipe her
If I hit it two times then I like her
If I fuck three times, I'ma wife her
It ain't safe for the black or the white girls
It ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe, it ain't safe
Tell your man pipe up, nigga, pipe up
Hunnit bands from the safe in your face, what'd you say?
Money dance turn this shit into a nightclub
