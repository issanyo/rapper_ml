[Verse]
New Prada bag
Brown Butterscotch
They don't know Flack-o
I'm grippin' the guap
I do what I want
I'm sippin' the wock
I model for Dior
Gucci down to the socks
Bitches gone fuck
Bitches gone flock
Callin' me daddy
Poppy and pop
You must have forgot
This nigga's colossal
My bitch is a model
Gettin' the guap (gettin' the guap)
Do what I want
Sippin' a lot
I've been trippin' a lot
Got a script from the doc
I just fibbed to the cops
I don't talk to the 12
I don't snitch to the cops
I forget shit a lot (word)
[Repeat]

[Outro]
Bitches gone fuck
Bitches gon flock
Callin' me daddy
Poppy and pop
