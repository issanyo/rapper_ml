[Chorus: Treez Lowkey]
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch

[Verse 1: Key!]
I need a jazzy lil' bitch
Nothin' get past me, lil' bitch
Don't want me no average lil' bitch
Want me a savage lil' bitch, huh
Ass fat, it's overweight, ayy
She been riding on my wave, huh
Take her on a dinner date
Tell her just sit on my face, huh, yes, ooh
Her boyfriend run the bando
While I'm runnin' out the back door
Yes, I am the wiz', huh
I want a tropical bitch, huh
Got me a tropical bitch, huh
Ass, fat, shit, huh
Got me a tropical bitch huh
Ass, fat, shit

[Chorus: Treez Lowkey]
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Exotic, my bitch from the tropical
Guide her with choppas through, optional
Showout, there's rooms at the hospital, optional
Physical, necklace is bad for your optical
Visual, optional, optional
Abstinence, celibacy
Sell her pussy on accident (optional)
She sell a bit when she prostitute (optional)
Dick so good, make her beg for it (hey)
I lick so good, make her pay for it
Pull a stack out like wait for it
Throw it in the air like rainforest, pouring
Tropical, tropical, these niggas not on my altitude
Longitude, latitude, whats with the long face and attitude?
Flex like it's no other option to

[Chorus: Treez Lowkey]
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch

[Verse 3: Treez Lowkey]
I left my bitch for dope, I'm fuckin' with a better bitch
She love to cook food and she love to suck dick
She love to sip lean and she love to bust straps
I'ma have to take it easy, let lil' shorty do my hits, yeah
Cookin' up that white, I got it lookin' some grits
I never sniff that work unless it's off Rihanna tits
'Less it's off Selena tits
'Less it's off Beyonc√© tits
We can't front them boys no work
Callin' up he need a brick
Callin' up I need a 6
Juggin' at the Motel Six
I was smokin' loaded sticks
Fuck my bitch while watchin' flicks
I can't go no low, thats it
Fuck you mean we talkin' chips?
Hot like takis when I spit
Eyes so low, no Tokyo drift

[Chorus: Treez Lowkey]
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
I need a tropical bitch, I need a tropical bitch
