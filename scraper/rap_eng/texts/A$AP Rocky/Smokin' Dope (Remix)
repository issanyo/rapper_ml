[Hook: Karmah]
Ridin' round town, smoking dope, we smoking dope
LSD, THC, nigga, DMT, DMT (splash!)
Ridin' round town and smoking dope, nigga, smoking dope
LSD, THC, nigga, DMT, DMT (splash!)
Ridin' round town, smoking dope, nigga, smoking dope (splash!)
Smoking dope, smoking dope

[Verse 1: Karmah]
Red lights, yellow lights, green lights
All I see is crazy things
Bad bitches in my room
Classified by how they give brain
Molly tabs, acid tabs
Take that shit straight to the brain
Turnin' up with my old niggas
Thought I blew but ain't shit changed

[Hook: Karmah]
Ridin' round town, smoking dope, we smoking dope
LSD, THC, nigga, DMT, DMT (splash!)
Ridin' round town and smoking dope, nigga, smoking dope
LSD, THC, nigga, DMT, DMT (splash!)
Ridin' round town, smoking dope, nigga, smoking dope (splash!)
Smoking dope, smoking dope

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Woo, dope, dope, dope!
Dope, dope, dope, dope, dope!
I bought a zip of the dope!
Dope, dope, dope, dope, woo!

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I might let her sit in the Ghost, uh
Fight for my 'tention the most (dope)
Liking my pics when I post (dope)
Might put my dick in her throat
Throat, throat, throat, throat
I admit I'm kinda wired
Eyes open wide, even when I'm tired
Go to sleep to lullabies
Wake up to menage, panties to the side (side)
Fifty thousand for the coat
Another fifty in the yellow envelope (woah!)
Prolly thought a nigga broke
Never clipped the bros, walking, smoking dopes (splash)

[Hook: Karmah]
Ridin' round town, smoking dope, we smoking dope
LSD, THC, nigga, DMT, DMT (splash!)
Ridin' round town and smoking dope, nigga, smoking dope
LSD, THC, nigga, DMT, DMT, (splash!)
Ridin' round town, smoking dope, nigga, smoking dope (splash!)
Smoking dope, smoking dope

[Verse 3: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yo, mixing these chemicals, send it through
Elements, diamonds and minerals
Pelicans high on the residue
God, it's incredible, chopper leave vegetables
Taking a trip and I'm spacing out
Look at my life and my bank account
Chopper not working, I'm hanging out
Shooters on deck and they banging out (banging out)
Yah, first of the fifth on the morning trip
First in the morning, I'm buyin' lunch
Flacko got zips of the Skittles
Not living no riddles, you point and I line 'em up (yo)
Smoking the dope, got a package from Hope
Got the pack for the low, got the crack for the low
Got a package and still got the gat
That go 'bout that action, we clappin' like after the show

[Hook: Karmah]
Ridin' round town, smoking dope, we smoking dope
LSD, THC, nigga, DMT, DMT (splash!)
Ridin' round town and smoking dope, nigga, smoking dope
LSD, THC, nigga, DMT, DMT, (splash!)
Ridin' round town, smoking dope, nigga, smoking dope (splash!)
Smoking dope, smoking dope
