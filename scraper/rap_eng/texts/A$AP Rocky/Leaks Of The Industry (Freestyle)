[A$AP Rocky]
Acappella with my fellas
You know I need a cinderella under a umbrella
I tell ya, don't put the camera in my mouth cause I ain't serious
I ain't sure, is yous scared
I said for sure
I had to sign a fucking clothed doll
Now I need a real doll
To come and be my tit drill doll

[Interlude]
Give me a beat bruh
I ain't say shit right now bruh
C'mon man I need to spit some dope shit bruh
Cause I'm sounding like Malibu's most wanted right now bruh
Traffic traffic looking for my chapsticks, know what I'm saying
Give me anything bruh, just give me a beat bruh
I'm like freeway right now
Through a beat on there

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Flacco tell me what your name is
High like chains every since you became famous
And you know these bitches in my way they is the lamest
And my old bitches they be always on that same shit
Niggas who I hang they gang bang way beyond that same shit
That gang bang shit and I let my chain switch
And I let the lane switch
When I do this it’s so dangerous
Hit you with that stainless
Nigga why you playing, nigga what you saying
I be spraying AKs and texting Rolex
Roll through your jet, show no respect
Then call a Jeff, no sheriff
Niggas know I did it for the thrillest
I don’t give a fuck about your feelings if you feel this
Shout out to my killers we the realest
100 dollar bills, 4 wheelers out the motherfucking ass
Nigga kiss my ass, your bitch love my swag
And I got money out the ass cash up in a bag
I remember last year I didn’t have a dime to spare
Now look at me here
Got money long as my hair
Got your bitch on the ware want to see my underwear
Never give a damn about your fear
I don’t fear, no I don’t care
I don’t get no motherfucking hate on my time
Fuck that I’m in the state of my mind
I’m probably in my prime
And I do this for my leakers
Holler I need 80k for a feature, nigga
Bleed it out your speakers
And I got them divas
Reese pieces Jesus pieces
All up on my, ugh
Glitter chains and I let the motherfucking cheddar bang
You should of shouldn’t came
I’m with the triller gang
