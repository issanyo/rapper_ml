Instru 1

Bout to shut down the future festival
And my future see a lot of decimals
Show you coward suckers what the tech'll do
Leave 'em stiff, leave them frozen like a vegetable
Westwood whats really good in the hood my dude?
And I've got the drop top you see me driving through
I get them chopped and screwed I got the livest crew
I'm doin numbers every summer man I got to do
Pots and pans when I do my dance see my pants they come from France
Bitches wanna go on dates, if they broke they ain't got no chance
Tell her I need Goyard bags, tell her I got all that swag
If you wanna date me, bitch, better take me
To Chow's or Phillipe's, bitch you seen my peops
A-S-A-P bitch we deep up in these streets
Pretty nigga gold teeth and I roll too deep
If you want it with my niggas with the reaper you will meet
Huh, sleep up in that dirt nigga, leave 'em in the hearse
Pretty nigga long shirts they say we wearin skirts
50 for a verse I tell you it might hurt if a nigga on my turf
Talkin records gettin murked
And I swear im in the charger, fuck that we in the Lam
Crazy ass nigga somethin' like the son of sam
Goddamn I'm the man in my kicks from Japan
Brother man fifth low, and I do the disco

Oh

We bout to won the grammy
Next year cause my shit came too early
I’m the jiggy young nigga bitch you heard me

Understand me (2x)

Long live A$AP is winnin' Grammys
'bout ten a those, 'bout ten a those
And my bad bitches always be in centerfold
Rocky where you been? I been thuggin' lately
Fuck that shit these niggas watchin' jockin' and they buggin' lately
Talkin' bout I’m switch hittin', talkin' 'bout I'm mainstream
You should just be happy a young nigga who made green
Made dreams come true though and I’m high on Pluto
And I got a foreign car it only came with like two doors
And got niggas dead broke career kudos
I don’t give a fuck but this shit right here my new flow
My old flow you stole that, old shit that’s throwback
Fuck that I got the white cap on black hoodie and a skull cap in
Bitches know better fall back, ball bat to your head
Crack that leave you dead heard what I said
Then i’m all ah scraps and my lips is looking chapped
Cause I ain’t got chapstick to put it on my huh
Tell your fucking girl suck up on my knob
Cause I’m a A$AP nigga ridin' with the mob in the suave

Aye Westwood what's good?
You got somethin' else for me?
This is off the top, Whatever you got
Jiggy cause I'm pretty boy
Jiggy cause I'm pretty

Lil' Keke got free free bose but you know I scroll it
Fuck that shit we got this weed up and you can't be rollin'
See my piff game niggas holdin' it down in London town
When I come around got to hold that crown, four pound I shut 'em down
Harlem nigga never stutter word to my mother
And you rich bout to keep it gutter in a butter never butter
Never stutter never nervous
Runnin' from the cops, drunk as fuck and I'm swervin'
And I got a permit, I ain't got no license
And I wrap the game tight, you can call it vice grips
And you know your biceps get hit with that tech if you talk
Respect it you better respect, Protect Ya Neck that Wu-Tang shit
Niggas gettin' throwed for the twenty thirteen on the scene
A$AP ya' mean getting green, green, green, green
Gettin green green
Got five for these verses, purple like his shirt is
A$AP up in London town, gotta tell 'em where my turf is
Other rappers is worthless, leave them all in hearses
And I got like 4 long shirt thieves they ain't no shirtses
No curses, fuck that, back on the trap when I spit
Fuck that they can go back on my dick when I come with this classic shit
Cause they bitin' but ain't nobody excited when I write it
So it's off the top if you know the hype is still the heighted
The climate, they climbin', My teeth ain't got no diamonds
I'm rhymin', I'm shinin', Fuck that shit this is blindin'
And you know we just grindin' until we eatin'
And Rocky is the best it ain't no mother fuckin' secret
Westwood, Westwood what's good? Freestylin' off the top of the dome baby
A$AP, Long Live A$AP in stores, Go get it today baby
A$AP Harlem World nigga

Hey Westwood, what you want me to spit about? Say anything

[Westwood] Yo, Being A$AP Rocky kid

Rocky kid, and you know I'm that cocky kid
Fuck that made history just look back at what Rocky did
In one year alone, no protege, you better hate
Can't relate, Fuck that these wack niggas they led astray
Paper chasin' and chasin' paper, fuck that these niggas haters
Got the lasers, they got tasers. We the greatest, we the Lakers
We the Knicks, get off our dicks, these bitches tick tick-tock on the clock
On the dot, when I'm on my shit won't stop until the fuckin' cops come knockin'
What's poppin'? What's happening? Turn down this music?
What you mean nigga? I gotta be a legendary influence
In my mother fuckin' culture, my mother fuckin' era
And you should just admit it can't nobody do it better
Gotta Hood by Air sweater, this shit is M3
And I'm in a M3 till my nigga Benji's we throwin'
We ballin, it's snowin', we glowin', it's rainin'
We came in, we changes, it's ours for the takin'
We makin' Jamaican bitches shake it, what's happenin' make it
Because we money makin', Manhattan ain't no shit takin'
Mistakin' you crazy, you flakin' I mean they wanna say what they be sayin'
Illuminati all he sayin' oh that gay shit that they say
Shit I can't be with these mother fuckers talkin' crazy about us
Nigga better bring the ruckus. Niggas know I'm west coast
And I got them chuckers and I bring it up town, up to Harlem mother fuckers
Wassup? Yeah yeah A$AP nigga

Off the top. Next time we gotta do this for a hour straight
Blow down, I gotta bring the Mob out here, A$AP Mob out here one time
