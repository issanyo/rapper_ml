[Intro]
I can't blame you
I can't save you
But I will try
For you and I
For you and I

[Verse 1]
I won't find out
All the dirty little things that you've done
But I will try

[Pre Chorus]
I'm coming for you giants and you liars
And your chariots of fire
You charmers with your anecdotes
Have started to show your true colors

[Chorus]
Now I’m staring at the moon
Wondering why the bottom fell out
And searching for answers
And it’s questions I found
Open your eyes, and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink?
Or are you waiting to drown?

[Post Chorus]
I would break you
Before I let you
Fall into a blind
For you and I
For you and I

[Verse 2]
I will breath in
All the truth I can stomach
If it keeps you alive

[Verse 3]
We've changed the dreamers and the preachers and the wise men on the hill
To concrete stepping smilers
Terrified to lose their power and control

[Pre Chorus 2 - Bridge]
We've been crying for a leader
To speak like the old prophets
The blood of the forgotten wasn't spilled without a purpose
Or was it?

[Chorus]
Now I’m staring at the moon
Wondering why the bottom fell out
And searching for answers
And it’s questions I found
Open you eyes, and share this burden somehow
Are you ready to drink?
Or are you waiting to drown?

[Outro]
You'll never be whole
You'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And think freely to smash the wall of apathy
Stop your self-importance and lift the weight off somebody else

You'll never be whole
You'll never be whole
Until you lose control
And stop drinking the wine, that's been dripping
From lips of the gluttons and envying their bloody teeth

And you'll never be whole
You'll never be whole
Until you lose control
