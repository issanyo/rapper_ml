[Chorus: A$AP Ant]
Motivation foreign, motivation foreign
Dior on my feet, everyday foreign
Motivation foreign, motivation foreign
Car from Germany, everything foreign

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant & A$AP Nast]
Everything foreign, vintage Ralph Lauren
Feel like Jeff Gordon, Switzerland touring
You H&M sporting, you niggas is boring (goddamn)
Got a white bitch on my dick, yeah she snorting
Drive the whip fast till I crash it, I'm a bastard
Lil Boosie, I'm a savage, fuck her then I pass it
Flacko smashed it, Bari smashed it
(Harlem and London, same ting)
(Harlem and London, same ting)

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Got this bitch all in my face yeah
Fuck her then cum on her face now
Spend a whole check on my waist yeah
Bag it up, it's on the way yeah
I do what I want and they hate, uh
I do what I want and they hate, yeah
Trust a soul that's okay yeah
Keep a pole we okay, yeah

[Chorus: A$AP Ant]
Motivation foreign, motivation foreign
Dior on my feet, everyday foreign
Motivation foreign, motivation foreign
Car from Germany, everything foreign

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
L-O-R-D F-L-A-C-K-O
Aye yo' I heard you a featherweight
Vroom vroom, zoom zoom
Winnipeg, paper thick, the paper chase
Stoned all in London town
Smile for the camera lenses, I ain't shy
I'ma fly by, I'm a fly guy
Sell that ya-ya, yeah yeah yeah
On the corner everyday when you see him posted
Toasted with the soldiers
Robbers with me, choppers on us
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Holy matrimony, married to the guacamole
Avocado seeds up on my broccoli
Drop my socks pony, got my thot in Chlo√©
All of my hoes are foreign man
Know how I love them bitches though
All of my hoes are foreign man
All of my hoes be switching hoes

[Chorus: A$AP Ant]
Motivation foreign (Harlem and London, same ting)
Motivation foreign (Harlem and London, same ting)
Dior on my feet (Harlem and London, same ting)
Everyday foreign (Harlem and London, same ting)
Motivation foreign (Harlem and London, same ting)
Motivation foreign (Harlem and London, same ting)
Car from Germany (Harlem and London, same ting)
Everything foreign (Harlem and London, same ting)

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
I'm in the ends now
I'm in the ends now
In the Rolls with my mens now
In the Rolls with my mens now
