[Intro: Sample]
"Mo—money and the power, money and the power"

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Dean Blunt]
Eyedrops, ("Fuckin' with the killas")
Teardrops
Droptops, ("Fuckin' with the killas")
Ice blocks (Beat drop, beat drop)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I was thinking to myself (Calldrops)
Maybe I should seek some help
Maybe I should blame myself ("Don't expect no money")
My mistake in stealth is going away
("Don't expect no money")
It's going away, it's going away

[Chorus: Dean Blunt]
Eye drops
Teardrops
Droptops
Ice blocks

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky & Kodak Black]
You used to be so soft
This is a prepaid collect call from
("Fuckin' with the killas")
Beautiful teardrops on your cheeks
An inmate at Florida Correctional Institution
Beautiful things
This call is subject to recording and monitoring
This-this life and situation and shit is scary
Uh-huh
You ready right now?
Yeah, I'm ready, got you on speaker

[Verse 2: Kodak Black & A$AP Rocky]
All the pain I went through (went through)
Turned to a singer
I put it all on my tattoos (tattoos)
'Cause of where I came from
If I ain't ever learned before (learned before)
(This call is subject to recording and monitoring)
Then this will be painful
Sleeping in institutions, I lost my baby
If that ain't ever woke me up, then it's gone wake me (woke me up)
But I'm keeping a light up on my fire, then they took my baby
I man on kind, is doing his time, but it's for no reason
I mean the kind, that ride the pipe, something you free—something you free—something you free
(This call has dropped, to add more credits, please press 1)
(Free Kodak)
