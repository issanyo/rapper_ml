[ASAP Rocky]
Think about the smarts, words said of wise
Do it like paz and I do it like naz
You got 2 small fries by the size
And I get a gat, 2 times, 2 times, rap
Ratatat on your motherfucking.. back
Niggas know how I do it, asap
Gold chains, bitches give me brain
And I’m insane in the membrane man
Niggas bring pain and I might make it rain
I’m talking bout bullets I ain’t talking bout change
Oh shit, they whole style changed
They was looking at me, now they don’t rap the same

This is off the tip of the top of the dome
When I’m rapping miles deep
In the back, and you know I’m asaping
Pants sagging, and I come through hop the band wagon
Cause they love how I do it
I ain’t never been no faggot
And I gotta habit, tat off this habit
That I do and I get lettuce like cabbage
You talk about me, you up in my passing
And I got gliss on, you can call it carriage
You look embarrassed, tell me what your name is
Blat, blat, now a motherfucker famous
I ain’t change shit, leave you brainless
With this stainless
I’m on the same shit, that gang bang shit
Niggas who I hang with, is my crew
And I do, do the do, what it do
Chilling with Raheem, and I come through, with the high beam
And I’m sitting on that lean, and I got 2 bad bitches
But you can call them Siamese
Niggas know my name, niggas know the name
Asap, Ant tell them what it is mane

[ASAP Ant]
I said flow like the ocean, sour weed potent
White girl actress, we fucking on saturn
Henny got me blacking
Roller bands stunting, billboard fronting
Free clothes for nothing
Fire plate orange car glowing like a pumpkin
Low behind wheel, bucket hats hell
See you hundred horses, do it for the pleasure
Higher than a feather, coke that I measure
Put it on your tongue, it get no better
Flying over dodgers, chilling with the lowers
African soul, black diamonds boy
Got it from the source, be by the cake
I’m a boss, never take a loss

[ASAP Rocky]
Who shot them, red dot them
If I spot them, Raheem Duvaughn
You can call em Raheem dot them
Cause he hit them with the beam not mean
Sitting on the top, looking at the.. top
Of the throne, better watch it
Keep your hand out my pocket, your crew
And you say I chew, so I bless you
And I got a new flow
You could call it special
And I might hit you with the tec tec 2
And I got a bad bitch, who I sent a text to
Niggas know my name, it be rocky
And I’m flacko man, so call me papi
And Versace, or givenchy … I’m a fly nigga, gq watch me
On vogue and I did it in shows
And I’m a fly nigga, might step out in a robe
Niggas know how I come through like Hov
Like B.I.G and I see y’all on that DVD
I’m on MTV, Cause I’m sucker free
And you know your bad bitch she be sucking me
Nigga, wassup
