[Intro]
808 Mafia
Cozy boys

[Hook: Waka Flocka + (A$AP Rocky)]
Car from overseas with four pipes
Met her in the club, I'ma fuck tonight
All my niggas felons, damn right
Nigga what the fuck you sellin'? That all white
(I can't forget that off swipe
Snow white in my frostbite
Whippin' and pitchin' that powder
Whippin' it harder, give it a short price)
She fuck with me then she alright
A$AP yellin' for life
(All my niggas rep Brick Squad
Fuck around and it's on sight)

[Verse 1: Waka Flocka Flame]
I'm sellin' records while my dogs cookin'
I'm rockin' shows while you catch a plug
Fuck niggas, show 'em no love
And police, they can eat a slug
Cop killers give 'em hollow tips
Them bullets burn, I'm a rider bitch
Rental cars, hop out of it
RIP to the opposites

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
To the hatin' hoes, tell 'em ride a dick
White hoes love chocolate
Pretty Flacko and Flocka bitch
All eyes on me, 2Pacalypse
Might drive a Benz then cop a six
Drive a six then drop this shit
A year ago niggas was drinkin' Spades
Flacko home and he poppin' Cris
Nigga fuck cozy boys

[Verse 3: Waka Flocka Flame]
I be fuckin' hoes hoes, breakin' backs
Pullin' hair, girl throw it back
Real nigga bust a bottle, throw a stack
Fuck a hater bitches like I'm Goldie Mack

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
Watch these niggas gon' hate
And watch my niggas gon' spray
And watch these bitches gon' shake
If they watch these figures I make
I said, watch these niggas gon' hate
And watch my niggas gon' spray
And watch these bitches gon' shake
If they watch these figures I make
