[Verse 1: Longliveadamariz]
Bloody Ink on my pad spelled suicide all these thoughts around my mind about about suicide
All these teenagers nowadays do is scrutinize
And my friends telling me not to invest in the illuminati lies
But in high school I got used to red eyes and telling lies
So it's no surprise that the only thought that crosses my mind
Is constantly about suicide
I got a two door ride
Got no friends by my sad because they all left when the when all them rumors started to arrive
Now I’m trying to get this ice
And trying to live just right
But all through the night I keep replaying the scenarios through my mind
I can't get over them because at the moment it felt so right
But now when I look back at my life
It seems like
I should've turned left instead of right
(should’ve turned left instead of right)
Now what do i choose?
The bible or the rifle?
(Goodnight folks)

[Verse 2: Longliveadamariz]
Bloody ink on my pen, how do you spell suicide
Kurt Cobain even die because you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied still was crucified
That's why never judge these criminals
And them black folks lives looking pivotal
Me and your favorite aren't equivocal
Longliveadamariz over them i'm so digital
Some of y'all have done a lot of unforgivables
Now whenever i y'all near me, i don't see you, your invisible
I’m good with syllables
I’m so original
It's a miracle, that God have me this unconditional love
Even when i try to end it all and become a liberal
This is literal
You’ll never find another rapper quite so spiritual

[Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It’s all part of the plan
