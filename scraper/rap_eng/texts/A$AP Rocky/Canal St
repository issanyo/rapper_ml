(Intro)
Ugh... AP

(Verse 1)
They might hate cus I'm too real like 101
They're my sons but I wasn't there when they were born
Thinking I'm the Father n they know I'm the Holy one
Going to the club, packing up a thouie of ones

(Verse 2)
Our Kush so strong that we hearing our necklace bling
Our does so wrong, got our mains n we keep our tings
A virgo angel that like a scorpio stings
A peasant made my way up to be the king

(Verse 3)
Got a weapon it ain't real, I'm just playing words of steel
Worship me? How that feel?
No bargain rights, chill and kneel
You real slow like a snail like when I smoke  and inhale
Now I'm high, high as hell
Fuck with me, getchu nailed
She like dolce or chanel
Nothing less or she will bail. (gone!)
Catch a body, do no jail
Pay the bail, got money still
Don't ask for it, cus I will
Fuck you over for a meal
Bro I'm trynna get a deal
Try and make it to a mill
Said Hello, like Adelle
No reply, I don't care
Gon be on me I can tell
Just make sure its not too late
Cus I won't fall for the bait
Money on me, you can't relate
What's real? Can we debate?
I made a will forget my fate
Openings books for new mind states
I'm from a hood forget a state
Won't let me in? I'll tear the gate
I do my grind to motivate
You should stop the hate, cus I see you being a bait
Ain't no food up in yo plate, so you know we can't relate

(Hook)
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same

(Verse 4)
Trynna pop a molly but am probably not gonna
Don't even own a gun but I got some young gunnas
All I'm trynna do is stack a couple hunnas
Invest in better livings for my sister n my momma
I leave drama to yall, take a trip to the bahamas
And I be on a roll so I'm dancing like moana
I leave drama to yall, I just focus on the ball
Leave drama to yall, not unfocused I just stalled
I was rookie a week ago now I'm feeling like a pro
Made my way up through the mayhem, never needed help bro
2Pac resurrected as my muse n my strive
7 days gone past, I was born n he had died

(Hook)
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same

(Outro)
See you bang, they see you slay, you never pray
Believers...
