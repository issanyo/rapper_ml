Nmber Four

Testing... 1... 2

[HOOK: The Shed]
Thought of losing you is fighting all the lies
Tryna stitch a broken heart be fore it dies
Feel the pain
Through the soul
Feel the soul
Through the vibes

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Talk to the boy how you talk to the Lord
Talk to these broads how I talk to my dog
Marc Jacob plates, Margiela rugs
My boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs
Hop up out the first class, hop into that E-class
Cut raw, cut school, I ain't ever see class
If so, I was cutting in my nigga Steve's class
School of hard knocks, graduated with a G pass
G-Code, Street code, fake niggas; cheat code
Niggas trying to turn fake shit: green, cheap gold
I dont know how they do it for the freak show
But I ain't even go beast mode
So we toast

[HOOK: The Shed]
Thought of losing you is fighting all the lies
Tryna stitch a broken heart be fore it dies

[Verse 2: The Shed]
You talking to I
Wgui
(AYE!)
Take yo momma eye
Cause trauma cry
I'm that guy
Imma let you die
By that *whooo*
All you niggas pie
Pinky up like tea
Smoke a G
Smoke exotic tree
We wear gucci tee
Your degree
Not our cup of tea
Not my our of coffee
Get the fuck up off me
Okay see Versace, on the body, imma catch a body
Might just chop Audi, cop a copy, then get sloppy toppy
Leave her in the lobby, looking choppy, that bitch ain't nobody
Just a body
Kick her out karate
Find a photocopy, photocopy

[Verse 2: CHRI$$$]
Bitches be acting up
Yall Niggas be acting tough
