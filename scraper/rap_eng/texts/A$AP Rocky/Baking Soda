Said I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
So my baby mama, don’t gotta push a stroller
I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
I said said I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
So my baby mama, don’t gotta push a stroller
I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda

[Verse 1: All Over Chief]
And I’m jip jogging, pedaling off the market
Cut sharper than a sharpie not a
Marker but regardless I’m
Chilling on the holly oh, 4 hundred degrees
Boiling on the stove, coming back to me, let’s go
Ain’t nothing in my kitchen
A little arm and hammer
A box of Reynold's wrap, playing call on …
Pat-a-cake, pat-a-cake, let’s make some grands
Shake it in the pot, bring it back
Fast as you can
Said I’m cooking up the baking soda
I need some baking soda
Baby mama, feeling like Melanie Fiona
And she don’t wanna leave
But she gotta stay
Co drop at the top, yelling patty jay
Heat up the block, I make it radiate
Clear voice, gps, tryina navigate
Her baby daddy make, more than them other niggas
So what? So we can give a fuck about them other niggas

Said I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
So my baby mama, don’t gotta push a stroller
I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
I said said I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
So my baby mama, don’t gotta push a stroller
I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda

[Verse 2: ASAP Rocky]
Hey, I said I whip it like roasted
Riding with a boss bitch
Skin color mocha, you can call it chocolate
Trim yellow Porsche is you can call it cautious
Go down …
Haters get coasted, you can call them noxious
5 pound, break it down, caking off the chocolate
Baking soda frost in, whipping off this all shit…
White girls hailin' at us, Daly like Carson
Chilling with some twins like the Olsens, is awesome
Looking at the watch and then they wonder what it costing?
Nigga I be flossing, tell me why I talk shit
Pushing groveers, never strobers, tell me why you walking?
Nigga what you talking, this bullshit is nonsense
It ain’t bout them money, then it’s way above the contents
And I whip it hard like I was born without a conscience
Whippin' it hard, whippin' it hard, in my baby mom's crib

Said I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
So my baby mama, don’t gotta push a stroller
I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
I said said I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
So my baby mama, don’t gotta push a stroller
I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda

I’m living that life, and I’m so fly
Man I’m living that life
And I’m so fly
Man I’m living that life, life, life
And I’m so fly, fly, fly
That life, and I’m so fly

Bake me a cake as fast as you can
Roll it, pat it, mark with the beat
Put it in the oven for the baby and me

Whipping up the baking soda

I’m whipping up the baking soda
Whipping up the baking soda
