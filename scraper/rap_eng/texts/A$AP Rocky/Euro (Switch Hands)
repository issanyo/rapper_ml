[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and quit playin' with that bitch

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & (Kanye West)]
Too fresh, man, to be a class clown
Graduated when I sat down
They don't want you to show your ass
Had the Yeezy spazzes in the background (bitch)
Let's talk about the Raf now
Let's talk about the stash now
Hella niggas send my ho's up
All you bitches get passed down (bitch)
Every now and then, on the Act, wow
Maybe sing a little, bitch, I act wild
Bitches rubbing on me like a frat child
On London town, bitches packed down (bitch)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man you got to hate it
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated
Man, I'm underrated, over-overstated
Rappin' over thirty, talkin' out related
That's captivated, Grammy nominated
Your shit outdated, my shit upgraded
Your shit outdated, my shit upgraded

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man I'm motivated
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Kill they kids, tell that kid, hands in that bitch
I just penetrate and switch hands in that bitch
Man, you got to hate it, man, I'm motivated
