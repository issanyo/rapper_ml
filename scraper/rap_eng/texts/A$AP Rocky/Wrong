[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
La Musica de Harry Fraud
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & A$AP Ferg]
Father please forgive us
Couldn't tell the difference and it's on me (woo!)
I don't need to seek attention
Just to keep these womens on me (woo!)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong (yeah!)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong (woo!)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong (aye!)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Fuckin' on that bitch and I know it's wrong
Wifey walked in and she found that thong
She talk to my dick like an intercom
Then smoke that dick up just like it's a bong
I ain't gon' lie, this the realest song
Hit Ben Baller, get my glisten on
Trap Lord been gettin' his ceiling on
But I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong
I know that it's wrong so the boy pray
I speak to the Lord, don't ignore me
White model bitch doin' cocaine
Layin' her out in the hallway
Double strappin' on a ratchet bitch
So she don't take me to Maury
Man I done lost me a classy bitch
Fergie is learning the hard way

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & A$AP Ferg]
Father please forgive us
Couldn't tell the difference and it's on me (woo!)
I don't need to seek attention
Just to keep these womens on me (woo!)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong (yeah)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong (woo!)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg & A$AP Rocky]
(Uh) feel like I'm stuck in a maze (yeah)
My bitches lookin' amazed (uh)
Now she is goin' so crazy (alright)
She caught me cheatin' today
Eyelashes all on my bed (yeah)
Texts I didn't erase (uh)
Now she comin' at my head (yeah)
Thought I'd never see the day (uh)
Shouldn't have never been with them other broads (yeah)
And now I left my girl with another scar (alright)
Sometimes I take advantage just 'cause I'm a star (that's right)
I know it's wrong so I'm on my knees prayin' to God (uh)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & A$AP Ferg]
Father please forgive us
Couldn't tell the difference and it's on me (woo!)
I don't need to seek attention
Just to keep these womens on me (woo!)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong (yeah!)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong (woo!)
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong
I know it's wro-o-o-o-o-o-ong (woo!)
