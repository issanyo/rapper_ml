[Intro]
I can never read minds
I can tell what's 'gone be
Looking in your eyes, I can tell you 'gone see
Things you desire, you can settle off greed
But it doesn't really matter to me

[Hook]
Uh, I'm feelin' good
I'm feelin' good
How you feelin'
How you livin', bro I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
How you livin'
How you feelin', bro I'm feelin' good

[Verse 1]
I get throwed, take four sips
Get poured, take more sips
Ain't feelin' y'all, I'm grillin' y'all
Cause that's what most of my dough is
I toke it, ran Zone Six
Bitches know what my flow is
I'm drilling broads, my genitals
Cause that's what most of my hoes is

[Chorus]
Gold mouth, full of gold
Nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes
Mouth full of golds, nigga I got hella hoes

[Hook]
Uh, I'm feelin' good
I'm feelin' good
How you feelin'
How you livin', bo' I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
How you livin'
How you feelin', bo' I'm feelin' good
I'm feelin' good
I'm feelin' good
How you feelin'
How you livin', bro I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
I'm livin' good
How you livin'
How you feelin', bo' I'm feelin' good

[Outro]
These hoes say I made it, that just mean I'm up
Got an old school Chevy with a styrofoam cup
Got a mouth full of gold, got a pocket full of hoes
Got a closet full of clothes, rocky my jewelry with no stones
I be gettin' gold, I be, I be, gettin' throwed
I be sippin' 'till I'm old, I be pourin' 'till I'm floored
Tell these bitches "hit the floor"
Take of the panty, give me them clothes
Bitches know they only hoes, X and O's they couldn't [?]
Queen-ass nigga, pretty, pretty, motherfucker
Pop that fucking pussy, show it, show it, to these motherfuckers
When the fat lady sings that means the show's over
So I'm leanin' 'till I'm fallin' over, uhh
