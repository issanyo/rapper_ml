[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
A new disease in my town called Idiotic
Every pretty lady in my city got it, point blank
Periodically empty seats, dine at Cipriani's
Like Beyonc√©, they're getting by or they get embodied
So Sasha Fierce, a whole lot of tears
Rolling down her cheeks, crying till she's sound asleep
Preach, pray that today is not a lonely one
You gotta know you not the only one

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
You and me, we made a vow
For better or for worse
I can't believe you let me down
But the proof is in the way it hurts
For months on end I've had my doubts
Denying every tear
I wish this would be over now
But I know that I still need you here

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 3: Sam Smith]
You've been so unavailable
Now sadly I know why
Your heart is unobtainable
Even though Lord knows you kept mine

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one

[Verse 4/Bridge: A$AP Rocky]
We all guilty of the same crime
If you ask me, I might've had a couple women at the same time
But you handle the pressure, Jack Daniels for breakfast
A cap of valium mixed with antidepressants, precious
My momma said that we need love
Till I found out life's a bitch with no prenup, you're on your own
Divorces or court splits, decisions and choices
The Porsche or the fortress? Ignore it or forefeit

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
You say I'm crazy
Cause you don't think I know what you've done
But when you call me baby
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one
And I know and I know and I know and I know and I know
And I don't know
I know I'm not the only one
