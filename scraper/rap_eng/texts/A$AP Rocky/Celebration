[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
You know what this is
It's a celebration bitches
Grab a drink, grab a glass
After that I grab your ass

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Bitch I hustle every day, you could check my resum√©
Bad Spanish bitch, one kiss'll take your breath away
I could bag your girl in a broken down Chevrolet
Swag do the talkin', I ain't even gotta decorate
I was 21 when I bought my mom a condo
A guitar and a gift card down at Costco's
It's a cold winter when it's blowing past my goggles
Penthouse, top floor, window with the gargoyle
Performance down at Santos, Phantom suicide doors
Paparazzi slide-shows, showers with the slide doors
One night, five shows, two-seater, five hoes
Eyes closed, I can see them hating through the blindfolds
Niggas better switch it if the business ain't the convo
I'm all about my chicken nigga you could call me Roscoe's
If I wasn't spitting I'd be probably flipping waffles
I suppose God knows I coulda been a snot-nose
DAMN

[Chorus]
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Bitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)
Every night we celebrate, Every night we celebrate
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Bitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)
Every night we celebrate, every night we celebrate

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Fuck is all the talk about? Fuck these niggas talking 'bout?
Shit I know it's us cuz we the only thing to talk about
I been down to ATL, I seen how they walk it out
Cali Crip Walk it out, show 'em what New York about
What these niggas hating for? Fuck these niggas hating on?
I'm what they debating for, I'm what they been waiting on
Out there tryna take it slow but taking slow been taking long
Know I'm on the paper trail until I get my paper long
When I'm in the kitchen, catch me with my apron on
And it's back to business, A$AP is where they belong
And we on the grind, that's until I get my paper long
See your nigga's face every time you turn your cable on
Mami why your leggings on, face down ass out?
Tylenol and codeine got a nigga 'bout to pass out
Catch me on a grind and now a nigga 'bout to cash out
Get money, hella cake, every night we celebrate

[Chorus]
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Bitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)
Every night we celebrate, every night we celebrate

[Bridge]
When the boys roll, pull up on the block
Still we hustle, 'cause we run the spot
I'll be on my grind, every night dawg
'Til the coffin close, and my lights off
I hit 'em up, like my name's Shakur
Count my dividends, I'm allergic to poor
I hit 'em up, like my name's Shakur
Stack my paper up, I'm above the law
I hit 'em Up

[Chorus]
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Get money every day (Every night we celebrate)
Bitch I hustle every day (Every night we celebrate)
Every night we celebrate, every night we celebrate
