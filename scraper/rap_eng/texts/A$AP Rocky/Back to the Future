[Verse 1]
Back through the door, bag full of smoke
Sit back, relax and max with the hoes
Chat with my folks, laughin' at jokes
I’m hard to the core and she bad to the bone
Ask her to bone, chats on the phone
Her three friends with her just'a tagging along
As for the flow, back to the song
Flashbacks only bring me back to that thong
Cause we been getting, we’ve been getting high all week
Smoking, drinking, I’m her drug and she get high off me
Now I’m back to the store
Blunt wrapped, full of 'dro
Roll it back in that Backwood
Pass it and smoke
Want to get her high so I pass her the most
She want that bread and butter so I pass her the toast
That A$AP motto is "party, get high"
We back to the future
That Marty McFly

[Hook]
Sometimes I think about the past
Seems like the time is flying fast
So how my presence always last
The future’s always going back
La la la la la la la la la
Back to the future, that Marty McFly

[Verse 2]
Back through the door, back from the store
Back to the wall with my back to the wall
Rollin' up a blunt, passing it off
Ass on the floor, cash back on the floor
Mack with the broads, chat to the whores
"There go my niggas" dap to my dawgs
I prey on that pussy, chat with the Lord
Seem how it seems like I had it before
I think back, way back ran with my memories
We was getting high, sippin' on Hennessy
Now it's like lean
Thinkin' back seat
Way back riding on something clean, knamean
Twenty-tens
We don't do the teens now it's twenty-eleven
Let me know something take her back to my session
Back to the pad, now I’m back on that ass
Back to the future, back to the past

[Hook]
Sometimes I think about the past
Seems like the time is flying fast
So how my presence always last
The future’s always going back
La la la la la la la la la
Back to the future, that Marty McFly
