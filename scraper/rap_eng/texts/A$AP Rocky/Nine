[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
In life, God made two types of niggas
He made stand up guys and stick up kids
Yeah, yeah, that’s right
He made trill niggas and he made fuck niggas
Oh yeah, at the end of the day it’s really up to you to decide what type of nigga you want to be
Want to be a man or a mouse

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Stay alive, get money, really them my goals
Real nigga, streets took ten I know
Good niggas, heart turned semi-cold
Kill or be killed nigga, friend or foe
Police clapping niggas everywhere I go
Stay alert at all times, even when I toast
Smoking on a bomb or something like Lennox rolled
Kush God burn a whole seven then I rose
Might go shopping when I’m in my rogue
Don’t be alarmed, I’m just in my mode and all that
I’m stoned, I’m off wax
I’m blowed, it’s all facts
They holding nutsacks, I told ‘em fall back
Like all the way the fuck back
This that fully in the glove rap
Hoody while a thug rap
Your opinion, you can tuck that
Cause I do it for the stoners and they love that
Mobster tales
Anger, steaks, and lobster tails
Lead me, fuck a freebie, you a preemie, you are not for real
I’m cozy, sipping Rosé, I ain’t even got the time
‘Fore you try me, change your mind
Cause I’m rollin’ with that nine

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Keep my mind up on my money
Keep that money on my mind
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Rollin’ ‘round with my nine
‘Cause these stick up kids is lurking
‘Cause they out here tryna shine

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Keep my mind up on my money
Keep that money on my mind
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Rollin’ ‘round with my nine
‘Cause these stick up kids is lurking
‘Cause they out here tryna shine
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine

[Verse 2: Smoke DZA]
Accurate, give a nigga the beats like Madlib
Let my little homies catch rap
Have the block sounding like ScHoolboy’s adlibs
You know the cue
Fronting and you broke, you oh for two
Bow down nigga, what you ‘posed to do
‘Round hustlers niggas don’t notice you
I’m a D-boy, you a decoy
Detach and destroy
You D-League, I’m D-Will
Dead body, I keep chill
I do this off memory, fly you could never be
Make a movie in these unreleased joints like Spike
No Nike ID activity
Eating chicken francese in Italy
Not Eat-aly, Italy
Stay on my J-O
Been around the world like Carmen San Diego
Came from nothing, how could I fail yo?
I’m blessed my nigga, I say that all the time
For you try it, change your mind
Cause I’m rollin’ with my nine

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Keep my mind up on my money
Keep that money on my mind
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Rollin’ ‘round with my nine
‘Cause these stick up kids is lurking
‘Cause they out here tryna shine

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Keep my mind up on my money
Keep that money on my mind
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine
Rollin’ ‘round with my nine
‘Cause these stick up kids is lurking
‘Cause they out here tryna shine
I said I’m rollin’ ‘round with my nine
