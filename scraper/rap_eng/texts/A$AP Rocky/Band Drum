[Intro: YG]
I mix the 4Hunnid with the designer
Stay laced up
On Bloods
Stay laced up

[Chorus: YG]
I just bought my band drums and that **** came with the drum
Do a ***** fast like And-1, I need a bag then and some
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
I hop out the tub, my feet land on Gucci rug
*** ** **, then slide in her, make her tell me who she love
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: YG]
Uh, uh, baddies, lumps
Uh, uh, Mr. Klumps
Uh, uh, she on my, ****
**** her once, I don't *** the butt
YG always cuss, YG do too much
Oh my God he always wearin' red, he a super Blood
You ****** super sus, act like y'all be pistoled up
When them shots fire, all you ****** did was duck
Duck, duck, duck, duck
Duck, duck, duck, goose
I don't want her, she boof, uh
Heard that ***** loose, uh
Yeah she with the *****, ayy
Gave me head in the coupe

[Chorus: YG]
I just bought my band drums and that **** came with the drum
Do a ***** fast like And-1, I need a bag then and some
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
I hop out the tub, my feet land on Gucci rug
*** ** **, then slide in her, make her tell me who she love
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Woo
Big gun, handgun, shootout, And-1
Hop out, tap out, time out, damn, son (what?)
Goyard trunks, Gucci trunks
Goku, Trunks, asthma pump
Uh, uh, hit a ***** once he done
Crack 'em like Humpty Dumpty
She don't wanna ****, she dumb
Uh, uh, pastry cup
Cakey, rump, ice cream
'Cedes truck, nine screens
Brady Bunch, wide screen
I was 13 with fake bling
When Killa Cam was on the corner with the pink mink
My little man was on the corner with the clink clink
Gold bank, roll 8, gold links
Whole gang hold weight

[Chorus: YG]
I just bought my band drums and that **** came with the drum
Do a ***** fast like And-1, I need a bag then and some
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh
I hop out the tub, my feet land on Gucci rug
*** ** **, then slide in her, make her tell me who she love
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Outro]
Alert! Bomb first
Trained to go, **** hesitation
Ten steps ahead, not just of enemy, but of all men
Set an example by demonstration, not conversation
Fear of God, but with God keep a faithful relation
Do the unthinkable, pop up on that ass out the blue like peek-a-boo
All a man gots is his **** and his word
So whatever that man says, he gots to do
And if that ***** is yours, protect it by all means
Keep them real ******, some top lawyers, financial advisors and them get-the-job-done riders on your team
And now you're ready for the world, ya-da-da-mean
Stay dangerous
