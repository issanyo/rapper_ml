[Intro: Â¿Teo?]
Kids are kids, understand
Out late, going crazy, kids innocent
Kids are kids, understand
Out late, going crazy, kids innocent

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
The girls just want fun
The boys, we make noise
The girls kiss the girls
I, thank God, ahh
The kids will be alright, just fine
I heard about all of the long trials in life
All the drugs on my mind
All the troubles I can find
Still I smile
The kids will be alright, just fine
All the colors are alive
No longer black or white, ahh

[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, kiss the kids, call your baby daddy
Tell 'em who's daddy
Call your pappy, tell him that you happy
Shout it loud so they all know how you feel exactly
Inside sunny energize
Think about it like you feelin' alive
On the mama boy, she swear to God
Lady said that she ain't into guys
Brand new 'cedes with the intercom
Table made is for the dinner vibe
Ain't a killer so don't kill the vibe
Disrespect them, that's a different side
Adderall and alcohol (yeah)
The teachers called, the doctor called
The block too hot, the marshal called
See 'em grow and watch 'em crawl

[Outro]
Parents test the wine
The kids do the lines
Ahh, alright
Ahh, just fine
The kids turned out fine
The kids turned and run
I heard about all of the long trials in life
All the drugs on my mind
All the troubles I can find
Still I smile
The kids will be alright, just fine
Smoke weed, pour a line
The kids turned out fine
I, pour a line
I, lose my mind
