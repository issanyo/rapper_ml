(This is for my niggas getting high on a regular
This is for my bitches getting high on a regular)

Purple drank but I'll be flowing so quick
Purple weed is what I smoke in this bitch
Swag on the milli-on and yes I like my red bones thick
I got this Ciroc shit on lock like a red nose pit
Cannabis sativa swag and a Benylin flow
I don't lay around wit em, I just hit em and go
Niggas that be hating, whatchu actin' feminine fo'?
When I see him, I'mma treat em like a bitch and a ho
If you say you got purp, oh that's right
Only call it purp cause you ain't roll that right
He don't even know that I was with his ho that night
Go ahead, let her in, yeah I know that dyke, that's right

Swag, everything is purple, Swag
Everything is purple...
Swag, swag, swag

Everything is purple, Swag
Everything is purple...
Swag, swag, swag

Let me get into it like a delivery
Of an immortal when I'm in the middle, I'm
Makin' a melody, feel like a murda when
I'm in a purple epitomy
It be the remedy, gotta be feelin' when
I'm in the mind of a maniac and I be
Lookin' like I'm in a rhythm asylum and
I'mma be givin' the energy
Feel the spark force from a dark horse
When I drop them down I kill them
So get ready to have the blunt torched
Bottom niggas with the 2 seaters
With the 2 liter bottles full of Sprite and
Codeine on the front porch
With that, texas style, chi town
Horror flow, the person on the front page article
To break the big chunks down into particles, that's right

Swag, everything is purple, Swag
Everything is purple...
Swag, swag, swag
