[Chorus: Sample & A$AP Rocky]
Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
Gots to come faded drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
F-F-Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
Gots to come leaning, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
F-F-Faded

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
She's all that I need, I'm filling your cup up
With Sprite and codeine, she get me so high
But I'm down on my knees, was it your desire?
Your life or that lean? Wait a minute
Cause ain't shit changed, just a different day
This the kinda pain I just couldn't take away
Something like Wayne cause you couldn't feel your face
Is you in it for the feeling or the taste? Wait a minute
What's the mothafuckin' problem? Me and my niggas mob
Throwing up gang signs, fuck a goon and a goblin
Gold grill shining, don't ask me how I got 'em
Styrofoam cups with jolly ranchers at the bottom

[Chorus: Sample & A$AP Rocky]
Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
Gots to come faded drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
F-F-Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
Gots to come leaning, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
F-F-Faded
Ughm, wait a minute

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Hey and now I'm blowing hella smoke
Talking on my cellaphone and I got that purple on me
She sipping on my styrofoam cup
Telling me she wanna bone but I ain't got no condoms on me
She claiming I'm a Pimp C
Cause I'm sipping big mo when I'm on that screw juice
She sip it 'til it's empty
Purple on the mustache, now it's time to screw you
And I wanna chop and screw you, girl
Moving like it's turtle time feeling like the world is my mine
And I be on my Fergenstein
I stay on my money grind and I'm going outta my mind
Flying through the purple sky
And I'm in a different world and you kinda look like Jasmine Guy
And I'm kissing on that pink juice, sipping on that pimp juice

[Chorus: Sample & A$AP Rocky]
She's all that I want
Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
Gots to come faded drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
F-F-Faded, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
Gots to come leaning, drinking codeine and every fuckin day straight promethazine and
She's all that I want
F-F-Faded
Ughm, wait a minute

[Outro: A$AP Rocky]
You can smoke that weed
You can sip that lean, get high
She's all that I want
You can smoke that weed
You can sip that lean, get high
She's all that I want
You can smoke that weed
You can sip that lean, get high
She's all that I want
Bitch
