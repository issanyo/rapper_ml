[Hook: PeeWee Longway]
I'm rollin' round, juugin P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean
I'm rollin' round, juugin P's
I'm a rollin' pharmacist, I'll serve you lean

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Okay, it's time for a survey
Little pop quiz test, let's see
How many mini-me industry lames in the game you know want to dress like me?
Flex like me, tryna get fresh like me?
Do it up in the press like me?
Couple pussycat dolls on my balls
Probably wish their boyfriend was just like me
Seen a bitch last week, keep it G
I'ma come clean, I ain't even fuck her
Heard you a sucker, shits might gleam if i puck her
Sixteen gold teeth I'm a slugger
Roll a 60, P fuck with PeeWee Longway, the longway all day
Shout out to Thugger, I'm straight out the gutter
Nigga sixteen throwing butter, pretty mothafucka since 16, I ain't stutter
Jeremy Scotts! (Whoo) with the wings! (Whoo Whoo)
Bernie had the nina in the skinny jeans
Since my early teens, i been sitting clean, mixing, sipping lean
With the leader, up in illy beamers, that's a misdemeanor, fema

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2: PeeWee Longway]
I ain't never seen a nigga like me
Where he at? Where he from? I'd like to meet him
I'm a rolling stone cookin' with the rolly on 32 shots in my Nina
I'm a rolling stone got my rolly pollie on
Fuck it not Kafima and Katrina
Shots of gas bags in the Beamer
Pussy bald head like leukemia, watch me set it off like Khadijah
Stuffing my cigar with the diesel
Pull up jump off with the Keisha, see you out there I need my money for
Puerto Rican don't need a visa
Dope white name Mona Lisa, Frank Whitehead shot Tito
Longway not Carlito
Boot up off the molly I don't fuck with the easy hoes
Porsche 9-1-1 got it out the repo
Trap house naw bitch I'm trappin' rollin stizzle
Gas bags I got them bitches going for the lizzo
Fake shot glass and have them J's at the dizzo
I'm runnin them I'm a mob boss calling me Sunny
I'm connected with the pharm-ist got them pints by the hundreds
Whole lot of C notes rubberbandin' my hunnits
Still makin drug deals out the trunk of my Honda
Leanin of a double seal like I'm dumber than dumber
Rollin off a molly pill tryna fuck on your mama

[Hook] x2

[Verse 3: PeeWee Longway]
Servin you Xanax, the lean
The neigborhood pharmist I serve you codeine
My bitch she servin' the P's
And buy different bags, they go by Celine
She speak different language like she Puerto-gese
She droppin them fishes and whip it in grease
My trap house but her name on the lease
We might get married like Nas and Kelis
My bad I'm trippin' I’m back on my G
Matte black the forgi’s and spatted the Jeep
Just got an endorsement from servin' the lean
Thanks to extortion I’m cleanin the streets
Double R Royces I roll ‘em in fleets
My trap house stay rollin’ I'm never off beat
I'm baggin' up pounds to a new scenery
Trapper and rapper still strapped wit them hammers
I make that dope dance like im MC Hammer
(I make that dope dance like im MC Hammer)
Trappin the pharmist I serve you the grammer
And lean I get it from over the counter
Trappin the pharmist wit cameras like Tony Montana
And choppas wit clips like bananas
Longway
