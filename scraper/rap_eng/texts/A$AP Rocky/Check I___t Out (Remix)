[Intro: Skepta]
Squat made the beat (greaze)
Go Grizz (I'm still wildin', my nigga, this chump nigga)
Sike
W—W—W—W—Winner's Circle

[Verse: Skepta & Xavier Wulf]
Issa— issa green light, take a left then we take a right
Me and Xay in the Beamer, that's a scary sight
Air Max on my feet, lookin' china white (icy)
I know you smell the loud on me, that's that dynamite (boom)
Fuck a bitch, boy, fuck a nigga too, shit (greaze)
Get the money then we jump back in the space ship (mm)
Told my girl, "Drive the car", yeah, I'm pussy-whipped (pussy)
The world is mine, time is money, I'm forever rich (greaze)
I found my wave, I was surfin', I remember it (mm-hmm)
Xay told me "Keep your eyes on the jellyfish" (who?)
Bitches stingin', niggas leachin', doin' everything (everything)
But I'm the truth, that's a fact, they can never diss (never diss)
Fuck a bitch, boy, fuck a nigga too, shit (greaze)
Shirt open while I'm chewin' on my toothpick (boom)
Sub-zero, we the coldest niggas on the strip (icy)
She said she likes the way I speak, now she's lickin' lips (icy)
You see us winnin', never hatin', I don't see the evil (nah)
I light a spliff, meditate, start deletin' people
I saw your girl, we got history, I said, "Pleased to meet you" (sexy)
I know you heard Check It Out, this the fuckin' sequel (who?)
Seein' niggas get finessed, man, it's such a shame
I'm a north London nigga, we don't play them games
You see my hair turnin' yellow, goin' Super Saiyan (greaze)
Bass bumpin' out the window while we're switchin' lanes (who?)
Now fuck a bitch, boy, and fuck a nigga too, shit
I be in London in the ends with BBK and themI'm smokin' thunder while I'm huntin', I be huntin' shit
And I'll beat the brain out a nigga if he pull up to me

[Outro: Xavier Wulf]
Pull up, nigga, who? Who?
Who?
