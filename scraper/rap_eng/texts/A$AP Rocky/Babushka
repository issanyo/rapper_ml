Lyrics from Snippet

[Verse 1]
They call me F-L-A-C-K-O and don't play, no, 'bout my papes
Baked potato on that Drac, look, get them cameras out my face
Ain't no snooze up on my drapes
Squeaky clean, fuck you say?
Peep them teeth, lil dentures 'ppraised
Princess cut no dentist please
Say cheese for the camera (ayy)
Eight G's for the dancers (ayy)
Benji's in the safe (that's right)
Bentleys for the phantoms (uh)
But they all go to waste
So what more can I say?
Praise to the Lord, give him grace
See the scar on my face, uh, wait
!ecafracs on t'niA
Ain't no Scarface!

[Chorus]
I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars of the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate
To the scar of my face
All the stars in the globe
The world is yours, Scarface

[Verse 2]
I ain't ducking niggas, I ain't nothing for the seasons, shit
I ain't duck sauce since I began vegan, it's Flacko Joyde Season
Prada pants before the season
Probably ducked off in a quiet place with ya bitch
The Prada shades probably why you couldn't see him
You shittin' me?

[Chorus]
I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars in the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars in the globe
The world is yours, Scarface

[Verse 3]
Uh, fuck lungs, this ain't no hookah
Smoking while I'm strolling down Wooster
A buck fifty, my babushka
I pissed in buckets and prostituters
Dark skinnys and the Prada boosters
Don't tap me in the Prada boot
Rapper to it, power to it
Hallelujah then pray to God

[Chorus]
I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars in the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
I would like to dedicate
To the scar on my face
All the stars in the globe
The world is yours, Scarface
