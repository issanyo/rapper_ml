[Hook: ASAP Rocky]
Uh, I wanna go, little bit lower lower
Cause you get me higher
Why don't you come, a little bit closer closer
Cause you get me higher
Open the door open the door,Open the door
Cause you light my fire
I wanna go a little bit lower lower
Cause you get me higher

[Verse 1: ASAP Ferg]
You talking 'bout you really love me, but its hard for me to see
R-Ripping through my heart and its hard for me to be a G
Ms. Meagan Meagan Good you looking good on the t.v screen
This movie making me sick I think I need some codeine
Dr-Dripping from the tub and make me zone into a dream
Where one day you'll become my wife and we'll maybe have some mini me's
Laying here drowsy, and it's hard for me to see
That I've become infatuated with your perfect T
And those perfect lips, and them ass cheeks
Come into my funeral before I past cease
Cause i'd rather be dead than not in your possession
I'll meet you after life in 1 second
To hell if she ain't fucking with me
Oh, to hell if she ain't fucking with me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: ASAP Ferg]
Hell ain't what I thought it was I wanna come back
Raping all these hoes while the devil just laugh
And it's hot as fucking shit, hotter than when I got clashed
Fuck your worshiping these bitches you know god done slack
I wear wool patch with a gasoline hat
Top of the hill made a track but the money made back
That's the devil favorite song he wrote that shit until it finish
In-love with every second, and hopes the shit is finished
But the shit keep on spinning and spinning and spinning
And if I spray "Rawr" then a nigga catch feelings
A re-precaution crew, 6,000 deaths
And if I pick this gun its a thousand left nigga
To hell if she ain't fucking with me (fucking with me)
Oh, To hell if she ain't fucking with me (fucking with me)
