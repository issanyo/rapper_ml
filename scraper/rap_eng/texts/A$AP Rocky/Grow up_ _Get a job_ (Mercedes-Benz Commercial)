[A$AP Rocky]
You know, growin' up... I had this beat stuck in my head
Just no matter what I could never get it out
I guess when you're young, you can be anything you wanna choose

[A$AP Rocky in the scene with a kid asking for an autograph]
Hey kid you want an autograph?
Cool? Gimme down!

[A$AP Rocky]
But as you get older all of those options start to narrow
And before you know it every choice you made comes with a consequence
And whenever shit got rough... this beat was always there
But one day man... it just stopped
My brother moved on but...
Beat came back, passing through every vein in my body
You know, my older brother Ricky
Is responsible for me growin' up and having a real job

[Ricky]
Com'on Rocky! Just go for it! Just rap!

[Crowd]
A$AP, A$AP, A$AP...!!!
