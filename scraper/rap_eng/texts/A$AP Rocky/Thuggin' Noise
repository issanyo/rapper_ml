[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
A couple more commas richer
And I'm still mobbing with my niggas, bruh
That's why they don't like us rolling deep to the club
Nigga, fuck your club, nigga, wherever I'm at is the club
Nigga, suck a dick, swag, swag, A$AP

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Toot that shoot that Glock 9, jiggy nigga I'm 'bout mine
Pinky ring and my watch shine, your bitch is calling my hotline
Wide buggy look cockeyed, big pockets sit lop-side
Talk stupid get your mouth wired, we 'bout it 'bout it and rowdy, uhh
Bitches all on my jock, huh? Pretty nigga might stop time
Told y'all young niggas run this shit, including red lights and stop signs
A$AP niggas on the scene, huh, young trill niggas on my team, huh
Serving fiends ah, bitches scream, huh, see the beam, huh, it's the nina

[Hook: ASAP Rocky]
Rocky where you been? I've been thugging with my team, ho
Rocky how you been? I've been thugging with my team, ho
Rocky where you been? I've been thugging with my team, ho
Rocky how you been? I've been thugging with my team, ho

[Verse 2]
My trunk shake and my pink spill
Chrome lady with the grain wheel
Pussy niggas they ain't trill
And we toast to Ricky cause he ain't here
A couple bad bitches every day chill
So much snow, need a reindeer
Thuggish Ruggish like St. Clair
Trill bitches wanna hop up on the thing, yeah

[Hook: ASAP Rocky]
Rocky where you been? I've been thugging with my team, ho
Rocky how you been? I've been thugging with my team, ho
Rocky where you been? I've been thugging with my team, ho
Rocky how you been? I've been thugging with my team, ho

[Outro]
Aye, young nigga, aye, young blood
Don't let these niggas box you in, nigga, just cause you gettin' rich
Dont forget where you came from and who you really are, man
Talking 'bout you ignorant, nigga, you young, nigga
