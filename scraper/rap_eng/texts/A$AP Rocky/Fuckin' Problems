(Chorus)

I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring ya girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

(Verse 1)

Hold up bitches, simmer down
Talkin' hella long, bitch, give it to me now
Make that thing pop like a semi or a nine
Oh, baby like it raw with a shimmy shimmy ya
Huh, Royal'z get like we
Never met motherfuckers fresh like we
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me
Put the chrome to your domw maker you sweat like Keith
Casue I'm the hitta, the hitta hitta like how you figure
Getting figures and fuckin' bitches
She rollin' Swishers, brought her bitches
I brought my Homie'z they getting bent up off the liquor
She love my licorice, I let her lick it
They say money make a fuckboy act fuckboy-ish
But at least I'm not a fuckin' bitch
I be fuckin' broads like I be fuckin' bored
Turn a dyke bitch out, have her fuckin' boys, beast

(Chorus)

I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring ya girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

(Verse 2)

Oh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all the dumb fuckers you've been leading on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feeding on
Got a feeling that's the same dudes that we speakin' on (Oh word)
Ain't heard my album, who you sleepin' on
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along unless you brought the weed along
Then ju... (Okay, I got it)
Then just drop down and get yo' eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put The Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a dumb ass I don't know, then I don't trust it
Yes Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long dick homie ain't for the long talking, nah beast

(Chorus)

I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring ya girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it

(Verse 3)

Yeah, hoe this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she's from the hood but she live inside the valley now
Vacate in Atlanta, now I'm going back to Cali
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyeing me like a homie don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Bobby Learmont
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car
That mean your friends need to be up to par
See my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow
Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holla back, I'll do ya, beast

(Chorus)

I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem
If finding somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring ya girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it
