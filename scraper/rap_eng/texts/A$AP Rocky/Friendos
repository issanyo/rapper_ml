[Cecily Strong]: Go on
[Chris Redd]: Ahem, it's just like every time I bring up emotional conflict, he always want to--
[Cecily Strong]: You know what, let's use "I feel" statements
[Chris Redd]: Oh, my bad. I feel like every time I bring up emotional conflict, he want to talk about the Lambo
[Kenan Thompson]: Lambo!
[Donald Glover]: But it got the suicide doors though
[Chris Redd]: Enough with the Lambo man!
[Kenan Thompson]: Lambo!
[Chris Redd]: Just talk to me dawg
[Kenan Thompson]: Ayy!

She wanna hear 'bout our Mommas (Momma)
All of our fears and our traumas (bad)
Homies be asking me stuff (what?)
I don't be opening up (I'm fine)
Sometimes I cry, I don't know why
I just be wanting to fight (aggression)
Lambo on dub, doors going up, you know I don't give a fu-

[Skit 2]
[Cecily Strong]: See, you're deflecting. Do you see that? I think you do care
[Donald Glover]: Naw
[Chris Redd]: Dawg, whose idea was it to buy the Lambo in the first place?
[Kenan Thompson]: Lambo!
[Donald Glover]: Mine!
[Chris Redd]: No! No, I showed you 2 months ago on Instagram, I said "I want the ice cream-colored Lambo, with the suicide doors." Guess who pulled up to the strip club, very next week, looking like a dessert on a wheels?
[Kenan Thompson]: Pull up
[Cecily Strong]: Sounds like that ice cream Lambo was important to you--
[Chris Redd]: Mmhmm...
[Cecily Strong]:  --and when he bought it first, you felt...?
[Chris Redd]: Invisible
[Kenan Thompson]: Visible!
[Cecily Strong]: You needed him to hear you, but instead of being present, he was gone
[Kenan Thompson]: Skrt skrt!
[Donald Glover]: Look, I see that I hurt you. I'm sorry dawg. I think I was acting out 'cause I just missed our friendship. You know, before the money, before the Lambo
[Kenan Thompson]: Lambo!
[Chris Redd]: Ayy man, I miss that too, you know what I mean? Like, you think we can work on that?
[Donald Glover]: We sure can
[Cecily Strong]: Wow, you see what that was?
[Kenan Thompson]: Ayy

[Chris Redd]: Ayy, that's not true man, c'mon now
[Cecily Strong]: Let's, let's let him speak
[Chris Redd]: First of all, don't interrupt me bitch, I'm talking to my brother
[Cecily Strong]: Yeah, but instead of talking, bitch, how 'bout you listen?
