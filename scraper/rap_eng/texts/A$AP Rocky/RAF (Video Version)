[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
I done came up (yuh, ooh)
Bustin' down a whole bag (bag)
Broke nigga, step back (what?)
Why don't you peep a nigga's swag (yuh)
You don't even gotta ask (what?)
What are those? What is that? (yuh)
Please don't touch my Raf (please don't touch my Raf)
Please don't touch my Raf (what?)

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
I'm racked up like rappers (uhh)
I'm Raf'd up on camera (rich)
Get knocked out on camera (I am rich)
Squeeze pump like asthma (yuh)
It's rare Raf when I wear Raf (uhh)
Bare Raf when I wear Raf (rich)
Might invest into some Raf shares (I am rich)
Lil' niggas still share Raf (what?)
Yeah and I'm drippin' on racks (uhh)
Rick Owens be the tag (rich)
Do the digital dash (I am rich)
Yeah, I'm boastin', never brag (yuh)
Please don't touch my Raf (what?)
Bought a Kris Van Assche (yuh)
Alessandro Gucci glasses (yuh)
J.W. Anderson collab (uhh)
Yeah, she pop it like a mac (what?)
Yeah, she drop it on the bag (uhh)
I'ma buy another bag (back up)
Cause she always bring it back (uhh)
Yeah, you know how to make it last (yuh)
Plus a nigga keepin' tabs (uhh)
I'ma fly first class (uhh)
Quavo hit 'em with the dab (yuh)
Please don't touch my Raf

[Verse 2: Quavo]
Ho, don't step on my Raf Simons (yah, Raf)
Ho, don't step on my Raf Simons (uh, Raf)
Ho, don't step on my Raf Simons (ooh)
Do you know how much I'm spendin'? (huh, ooh)
My closet it worth 'bout a milli' (milli', yeah, yeah)
Took the lil' bitch to the runway (yah, uh)
Now she naked in the kitchen (uh)
Raf Simons (ayy)
All kind of crazy colors (ayy, ayy)
Livin' color (colors)
Left wrist, Rollie butter (ice)
Maison Margiela my sweater (Margiela)
Mama told me never settle (mama!)
Raf Simons, don't lace 'em (it's Raf)
Got your bitch, wanna date him (ooh)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky & Playboi Carti]
I done came up (yuh)
Bustin' down a whole bag (bag)
Broke nigga, step back (what?)
Why don't you peep a nigga's swag (yuh)
You don't even gotta ask (what?)
What are those? What is that? (yuh)
Please don't touch my Raf (please don't touch my Raf)
Please don't touch my Raf (what?)

[Bridge: Quavo & A$AP Rocky]
Please don't touch my Raf
