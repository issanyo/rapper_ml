[Intro]
Two, Three, Four

[Verse 1: Leslie Odom Jr.]
I'm on my 14 karats
I'm 14 karat
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't

[Pre-Chorus: Leslie Odom Jr.]
Gonna wear that dress I like, skin-tight
Do your hair up, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating

[Chorus: Leslie Odom Jr.]
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, good for you
Baby can I look good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
Still look good for you, yeah

[Verse 2: Leslie Odom Jr.]
I'm on my marquise diamonds
I'm a marquise diamond
Could even make that Tiffany's jealous
You say I give it hard
So bad, so bad
Make you never wanna leave
And I won't, I won't

[Pre-Chorus: Leslie Odom Jr.]
Gonna wear that dress I like, skin-tight
Do your hair up, real nice
And syncopate my skin to how you're breathing

[Chorus: Leslie Odom Jr.]
I just wanna look good for you, good for you, good for you
Baby can I look good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
Still look good for you, good for you

[Bridge: Leslie Odom Jr. ]
Trust me, I can take you there
Trust me, I can take you there
Take my hand, make you understand
So good, baby, (baby)

[Verse 3: Daveed Diggs]
I ain't tryna tell you how to dream, love
But I think that you could do better
Who let a little bit of doubt slip in
Slip it off, leave that slip on the floor
The slope slippery but let me slide this once, please

I came to you in my best, been tailoring my birthday suit
Been waiting for the first day you say yes
I play this game the best and came just to make breath an extension of blessings
No more and no less and the sex is impressive, OK
But the play is before and the mess on the floor is the best
I adore the way you seem unsure when the world's so obviously yours

I just wanna be good for you, everything I said I wouldn't do I would for you
Shining up and polishing this wood for you
Waiting in the hood for you, wonder would you help a brother out, I'm going out of my mind
Time is a factor I'm a disaster waiting to happen a minor infraction away, from a life sentence
Got my sentences running on and my senses is tripping
Come with me if you feel it
I promise it'll be so good

[Outro: Leslie Odom Jr.]
So good, so good, so good
Yeah, baby then I'll make it good for you
I know how to make it good for you
Baby can I be good to you
Proud I am
Make you understand
So good, so good, so good
Baby so good
Dress a mess on the floor
Proud I am to be yours
Baby, then I'll make it good for you
I'll make it good for you
