[Intro: Tinashe]
Love that n-
Love
Love that never ends
You...

[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, it's almost like
Can't nobody do it quite, like
I do it right
Give it to you how you live

[Verse 1: Tinashe]
Can we pretend
That everything is like yesterday
What if I just wanna feel you touching me?
Ain't nobody perfect
So if you take a while to make it worth it
I wanna pretend
Let's pretend that we 'boutta break up
To catch the feelings that way we make up
Legs up, suicide, north side
We never count points when we courtside

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tinashe]
Let's pretend I ain't your friend
So we can get it on again
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend

[Chorus: Tinashe]
It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
If we pretend that I'm happy when I'm really not
Pretend that I give you everything I've got
Pretend that I'm there when I ain't there
Pretend that I care when I don't care
Once upon a time, I did
Now I admit that I was fucking with a kid
Now I pretend that everything's straight
When everything ain't just covered up like paint

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tinashe]
Let's pretend it's my first time
So you can really blow my mind
Let's pretend we never met
A good excuse to play forget
Let's pretend you never lied
So I can give it up all night
Swallow my pride, and learn to forgive
When I'm looking for love I pretend

[Chorus: Tinashe]
It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

[Verse 3: A$AP Rocky]
To never fool around with you was my best deed
Stand-up guy, heart up on my left sleeve
When I could find another lover by the next week
Besties turn to ex-ies from a pep tease
Fuck what these other niggas on, I came to flaunt
What's that A$AP, little Saint Laurent?
Probably what you think about, the commas in my bank account
Pretty bitches bring em out, jiggy nigga in the house (ow)
When I caught her dancing by the couch (ow)
With her little booty hanging out (her blouse)
Stickin' something in her stomach
Got her screaming out "I'm coming", frontin' like you really want it
Still my nigga though

[Chorus: Tinashe]
It's you
A love that never ends
I pretend it's you
That I'm in love with

[Outro: Tinashe]
Can we pretend?
Can we pretend?
Can we pretend?
