[Verse 1: Asap Rocky]
We use to wear rugged boots now it's all tailored suits
Audemars piguets for my criminal recruits
Champagne flutes, bumpin' rhythm and the blues
Partner made bad moves, he might end up in the news
Or end up in the tombs or living in the boondocks
Riding by the rules i'll abide by it soon
See the situation weï»¿ sophisticated goons
Know you live by the gun then you die by it too
Niggas call me prophecy, swagging and philosophies
White on white wagon call that motherfucker Socrates
Rat ass nigga, fighting for a block of cheese
Catch me out in China stunning yea I'm about my guapanese
Shoe game serious so serious, bop her knees
Niggas say I'm blessed my bad I forgot to sneeze
They your reasons though bitch
I got some tissues for your issues tell 'em blow this

(Westwood what's good man?)

[Verse 2: Asap Rocky]
She just started to pop it for ??? in the back and tell me baby I'm trill
I started to smack it and enjoy it and I'm lovin' the way that it feel
Chilling it with Westwood
And you know she like to get me cause I sex good
After that, we go in London town and shut it down
All my UGK the kings of the underground
Rollie and parolees, and parolees wanna stroll me
Woly woly holy, woah camoly bitches blow me
Niggas do all my dirt by my lonely, and you tony
You phony Toni baloney, I'm pimpin' macaroni
I swear, Sony, play em like a Playstation
Niggas think they taint hatin', I don't give a fuck I stay makin'
Don't let that tec, hit you in yo neck, came for that respect
Gimme the check, with some set bitches, all dank on that debt
And they sipping and they drinking on that nectar
Swear I get these bitches with the heckler
And I'm chilling with my nigga Westa
Tim Westwood from the Westwood
And I come through in your neck woods
In your neck of the woods, in the neck of the hood, in naked goods
And they givin' me goods on my wood
