[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, I heard she got a man, homie
Yeah, he wanna lay the hands on me
But he should see the way she dance on me
Yeah, wishing I ain't had no pants on me
Yeah, I heard she got a man, homie
Yeah, he wanna lay the hands on me
But he should see the way she dance on me
Yeah, wishing I ain't had no pants on me

[Verse 1: Riko Dan]
Cuh me ah gyalist from early
Me like the gyal dem kinda thick and kinda curvy
You man are moving kind of sick, you're kind of pervy
You man are moving kind of thirsty (tramps)
Me have di gyal dem inna bungle

Talk clear, me nuh bloodclart mumble
Big man, not inna likkle man fumble (big man ting)
Di gyal describe me as a lighty
Di gyal ah tell me seh she like me
Kiss me up from the back and start bite me
Ah some big batty gyal ah entice me
Tantalise me, nobody chastise me
Gyal go weak in di knees from dem sight me
And di whole ah dem boyfriend wan' fight me

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, I heard she got a man, homie

[Verse 2: Riko Dan]
This gyal ah tell me seh she want me
Whole leap of gyal inna me army
And every day, a different one ah dem ah call me
They call me up because ah me ah get dem horny
Me get a call from Janet, but me never panic
Bedroom bully, everyting ah get damage
Say nuttin', di big thick one me haffi manage
But me ah no savage
I'm telling you I'm iller, tell you man I've been there
When I say I beat the pussy up, I'm being sincere
She's all toned up, I'm wearing nuttin' but some swimwear
I know a couple other donnies wishing they was in there (bad luck, guys)
She likes my swagger and she said I'm kind of cheeky
And I've been running through the pussy kind of neatly
And all their hubbies wanna beef me
But I'm the one she like, them guys are kind of neeky (idiots)

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, I heard she got a man, homie
Yeah, he wanna lay the hands on me
But he should see the way she dance on me
Yeah, wishing I ain't had no pants on me

[Bridge: Riko Dan]
Bare gyal me response for ('nuff ah dem)
Me ah di gyal dem sponsor

Dis ah no joke, ah no bloodclart banter (serious ting)
Becuh di gyal dem start fiend fi me
And all di gyal dem out on road, dem have a need fi me
I forgot a ting that keeps on telling me she's leaving me
But on the other hand, she said she wants to breed for me
Bare gyal me response for ('nuff ah dem)
Me ah di gyal dem sponsor
Have Colleen and Sophie and Sandra
Dis ah no joke, ah no bloodclart banter (serious ting)
Becuh di gyal dem start fiend fi me
And all di gyal dem out on road, dem have a need fi me
I forgot a ting that keeps on telling me she's leaving me
But on the other hand, she said she wants to breed for me

[Chorus: A$AP Rocky]
Yeah, I heard she got a man, homie
Yeah, he wanna lay the hands on me
But he should see the way she dance on me
Yeah, wishing I ain't had no pants on me
Yeah, I heard she got a man, homie
Yeah, he wanna lay the hands on me
But he should see the way she dance on me
Yeah, wishing I ain't had no pants on me
