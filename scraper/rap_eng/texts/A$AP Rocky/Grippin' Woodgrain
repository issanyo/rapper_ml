Smoking killer grippin' grain
Out my mind I'm so insane
Finest fabrics on my back
Bally kicks, Birkin Jeans
Smoking killer grippin' grain
Out my mind I'm so insane
Finest fabrics on my back

Clean with a dirty swing
Catch me with a bony thing
Louboutin everything
Engaged but no wedding ring
Type of woman I attract
Cheetah print all on the back
Sexy motherfucker you
Love how you be switching that
LA by way of New York
She tell me she love my talk
I tell her I love her walk
The way she bought without a card
Got me 'bout to set it off
Hit a bank up like Latifa, yeah that type of set it off
Favorite show the Commodores, minds is more like entourage
I be playing Vinnie Chase and mama get her Sasha on
Cutting till the break of dawn
Then I'm off, on the road, probably to another show
Different city, newer clothes
Different ho, a different stroke
Fuck you mean I'm gnarly Joe
My old head put me on the game
Keep it pimpin' never fold
So I spit it, here it go

I do the Raf Simons she ain't even heard of it
The situation looking flaky then I'm curvin' it
Condo out in Jersey, I ain't even furnished it
That's a sub-lease that lease ain't even permanent
Asap tat is on a nigga permanent
Long hair a nigga might just throw a perm in it
Maserati ridin' catch a nigga swervin' in
I'm moving fast, you can't catch up to my turbulence
Smoking lemon kush, yeah I'm eating good
I see the limit push, and I'ma leave for good
L-lil mama lookin' she heard I eat it good
They call me Hollywood, but I'm a keep it hood
Na-na-now I came down south, niggas know I keep it banging
Good whip, keep it ringing
Keep the wood grain I'm slangin'
4's and tippin' Nothing different
And we on that codeine promethazine the same thing
And it made my nose bleed

Tippin' on 4's, riding real slow
Everywhere we go, hoes wanna know
Who we are
We are them A$AP boys (Ayo-ayo, ayo-ayo)
