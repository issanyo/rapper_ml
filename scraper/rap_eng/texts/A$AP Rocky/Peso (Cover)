Intro (G5 Elz): That was good money right ? (laughs)



Verse 1 (G5 Elz):


I be that money motha fucka
Queens is what I'm Repping
Black damier stepping
Packing automatic weapons
Top model sexing
While you niggas stressing
School of swagg nots
Let me
Teach you nigga's lessons
Step 1
Let them Trues sag
My shoes
Match my boo bag
She Lightskin wit a few tats
Make a nigga say who's that
Waves on narly
Too radd
Sweater by under2flags
Moncler Jack no tags
Aura kicking off jet lag
Polo what I'm dressed in
Since my adolescence
YSL Vests
Past the French dressing
Sont on ray obsessions
Racks in my Jacob deniems
But find me on 197
Eyes low
Higher than the heavens
