[Verse 1]
Yeah Shade 45 and I stay so high
Yeah I'm with my nigga Sway everyday, and I repp the A
If you think I'm pretty, and you think I'm jiggy
Come on shorty let me know, let me know bitch
We can get together we can do whatever
But just don't jack my flow
Listen, ah, now these niggas in the game all lame
Yea, I'm rappin off the brain
I ain't got shit to say so, I'm about to play with my niggas Sway
Shit we do it everyday
Yeah, yeah, sharper than a razor
Pretty Flacko came through with the blazer
Dior for sure I go to seaports and then do detours
But I'm Lyor Cohen I go in Lindsay Lohan no friends
All these old bitches want to hold hands
Slow dance romance I could fuck old friends girlfriends
You know I go in, you know I go ham
All day nigga, A$AP, A, AA nigga
And I'm getting paid till the beat drop nigga
This is street hop nigga
With the white tee, got my James Dean on
This my theme song
"Flacko what you rappin bout now-a-days
How your paid?
Talk about your skin, talk about your pretty friends"
Let's talk how I got them M'$, lets talk about them M'$
Lets talk about the reggie, fuck it now it's time to talk reckless
I don't give, I don't give a fuck about units
I don't give a fuck about units, or numbers, or shifting units
Fuck that nigga I split your unit
Niggas gonna have to go and switch their unit
Pause, it's full of hoes so I kissed the unit
Hold up listen, look at how I just dissed the unit
And now it looks like I'm coming at G-Unit
Hold up, ayo 50 I heard you was looking for me shorty
What's the story, you don't want it with this gorilla wardie
Hold up, hold up
