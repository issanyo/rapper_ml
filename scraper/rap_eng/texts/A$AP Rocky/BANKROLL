[Verse: A$AP Rocky]
But I ain't no oil tycoon
And if I'm gone 'til November
Won't see my ass 'till next June
And it's true, and they broad day-time afternoon
Tryna' spoil my mood, I'm tryna' enjoy my cartoons, bitch

[Hook: Merlyn Wood, A$AP Rocky]
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me (Bankroll)
Every time you at the party it's a scene (Bankroll)
Always had to save you from a sunken thing (Bankroll)
Sunken place always coming in the dreams
