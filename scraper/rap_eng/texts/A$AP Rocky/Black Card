[Intro: A$AP Rocky]
Uh, black card, black card
Black card, uh, uh, uh
Black card, black card

[Verse 1: Smooky Margielaa]
Black card, black card, drivin' foreigns like a NASCAR
Dumb ops, drop top, pull up on you, let it pop out
Got all these O's in my bank account
I got Rocky with me, we be ballin' out
I got VLONE on me when I'm poppin' out
Don't come through talkin' high how you in my town
New whip, new chick on the 9 where they kill shit
All black, it's going ham, I'm getting fly, as they swiping shit
I just dropped a rack for these balmains (swipe swipe)
And I hit a lick and I flew right to L.A (swipe swipe)
Switching lanes with the gang do it all day
On the block where they trappin' the hard way
.40 shots, brain pop, all up on you with like 50 Glocks
My whip, two grips, drive-by, empty out a clip
Black card, Black car, drivin' foreigns like a NASCAR
Dumb ops, drop top, pull up on you, let it pop out

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
Black cops, black SWATs, black Glocks, bad blocks
Black thots, ass shots, fat twats, black box
Mash box, pass ops, rag tops, bad drops
Black hat, black plaques, flat tops, dreadlocks
High tops, red dots, black hole, head shots
Dot dots, last stop, last call, last shots
Black card, black card
Fuck boi, act hard, black heart, that part

[Hook: Smooky Margielaa & A$AP Rocky]
Black card, black card, black card, black card
Black card, black card, black card, black card
You could tell I run the business
Broke nigga mind ya business
Man, I spend with no limits
Y'all just started what we finish
Black card, black card, black card, black card
Black card, black card, black card, black card
Black American Express, black man tryna flex
All black when I dress (black card say it less)
