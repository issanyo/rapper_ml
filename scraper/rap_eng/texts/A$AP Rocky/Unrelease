[Verse]
Psycho, psychopathic man, loaded ammunition in his hand
They froze, he blows, blows...
Another lost soul from the city full of lost hope, where they go, who knows?
But I could bet my bottom dollar
It was over somethin' like money, cash, hoes, they clothes
But I could bet my bottom dollar
Down to my last penny heaven won't accept his soul
