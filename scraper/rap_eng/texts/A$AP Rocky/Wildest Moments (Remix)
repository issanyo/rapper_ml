[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
Wrote a song for your love and it go like this
'Till we’re gone with the wind
Then we blow like fish
’Cause we glow like sticks, words thrown like fists
If your love is the seed
Watch it grow like kids

[Verse 2: Jessie Ware]
You and I, bloodlines
We come together every time
Two wrongs, no rights
We lose ourselves at night

[Pre-Hook]
From the outside, from the outside
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try

[Hook]
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

[Verse 3: Jessie Ware]
Wait on, thunder sky
Wherever there’s smoke, there’ll soon be fire
What could bring bad luck
I’ve been looking at you too much

[Pre-Hook]
From the outside, from the outside
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try

[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Started like the office from the corner to the office
Ostrich on the Porsches for a portion of my fortunes
Flossin'
Her love is like a fortress
Enormous
Even trendy in our corpses
Fresh to death up on our coffins
Or we could fight the fuss till we get like friends
Or somebody bite the dust and we split like ends
Even in our wildest moments girl I'm on it cause you're worth it
Practice makes perfect
So we fightin' for a purpose

[Hook]
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Maybe in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

[Verse 2: Jessie Ware]
You and I, bloodlines
We come together every time
Two wrongs, no rights
We lose ourselves at night

[Pre-Hook]
From the outside, from the outside
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try

[Hook]
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all

[Bridge]
In the middle of it
We won’t, we won’t collide
Looking back I miss it
Our wildest moments
Are you thinking what if
What if we ruined it all
My wrecking ball

[Pre-Hook]
From the outside, from the outside
Everyone must be wondering why we try
Why do we try

[Hook]
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the greatest, we could be the greatest
Baby in our wildest moments
We could be the worst of all
