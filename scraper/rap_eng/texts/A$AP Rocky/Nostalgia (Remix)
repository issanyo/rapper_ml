[Sample: Erykah Badu]
Oh my my my, I'm feeling high
My money's gone, I'm all alone
To much oooh, the world keeps turnin'
Oh what a day, what a day what a day
Peace and blessings manifest with every lesson learn
If your knowledge were your wealth then it would be well earned
If we were made in his image then call us by our names
Most intellects do not believe in god but the fear is just the same

Oh on and on and on (my cypher keeps moving like a rollin stone)
Whew on and on and on and on (all night till the break of dawn)
I go on and on and on (my cypher keeps moving like a rollin stone)
Ohh on and on and on and on (god damnit imma sing my song)

I was born underwater with 3 dollars and 6 dimes
Yeah you might laugh 'cause you did not do your math

Like 1.. 2..3... (Damn, yall feel that? Oh...)
1.. 2..3... (The world keeps turning)
Oh what a day what a day what a day

[1st Interlude: Te’ Laurent]
I think I might’ve chosen the wrong girl
Might’ve opened up to the wrong girl
Girl I guess you just need to let me be
Girl I needed things to feel this cray

[Verse 1: Yung Rose]
Searching for the time I can’t get back
Reaching for this life I’m addicted
Reaching for this life I’ma get there
Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it, Fuck it
I’ll just find it by myself
Momma raised me gone and get it with no help
She said no one has your back just like yourself
And girl you proved that shit just like everyone else
I did it for you, you
I spent all day tryna get to you
I did it for you, you

[Hook]:
I stayed up all night tryna get this shit for you
Fuck you, Fuck you
Fuck you, Fuck you

[2nd Interlude] Yung Rose, Te’ Laurent:
Girl I never felt this thing before
Used to pray my demons go away, now I’m wishing that my demons stayed
Girl I’m wishing that my demons stayed
(Girl longer your gone I can’t breathe too)

[Verse 2] Yung Rose, Te’ Laurent:
Is that what they call love?
Fuck it girl at least it wasn’t deep
Is that what you call love?
Well fuck it girl that shit you can’t keep
Shawty I just, Shawty I just, Shawty I just needed time
But girl without you girl I’m not shy
Thought I needed you that was all in my mind
As long as I have these hoes girl I’ll be fine
I did it for you, you
I spent all day tryna get to you
I did it for you, you

[Hook]:
I stayed up all night tryna get this shit for you
Fuck you, Fuck you
Fuck you, Fuck you

[Outro] ASAP Rocky:
I seen things on the T.V identification
Split the nation that I once was raised in
Don’t recall no friendly neighbors face from my upraising
Back in my younger days, of razor blades with gangs who banging
Never stood a chance from boys who against far left harlem shaking
On the pavement, in my generation fuck em
In my society. burning trippy pages in my dairy
It’s the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me
You should never give a damn and I don’t give a fuck entirely
