[Intro]
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
It's the bodega cat and I'm back in the house
Nick, nack, paddy-wack, fuck your dog bone
I'm mobbin' with my cats, we relax on the throne
Which is on top of a bunch of potatoes
Lil' fine kitty lay on the top of the tomatoes
Fat pussy cat with a booty like J-Lo's
Body straight from heaven, God gave her a halo
Can of tuna fish, went straight to my navel
Now I got the itis and a cut like fredo
Man I hate refs always eating up the bagels
I say "hi hater," shoutout to Mano
Kanye walked in to pick up some rice
Guess who popped out, it was a talking mice
He said "hey you, wake up Mr. West, I know you fly but damn it I'm blessed"

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg ]
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
It's the bodega cat and I'm back in the house
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma meow
It's the uptown cat and I'm back up in the house

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
It's the jiggy-cat burglars
Fuck you him, burglar bruh
Fuck your grandmother up
Rips on your furniture
Ghetto brain like she went to Herkimer
She give me head till I shed (naughty kitty)
Trill cat shit, take a cat nap
Make her pussy take a cat skin
Fuck a cat fish in my mattress
That shit in in the bread aisle
That's where I lay my head
That's my bed now
Good riddance it's the bodega kittens
I'm the youngest of my siblings
Beat my dick with my mittens
You say beef, I say chickens
I don't really know a difference
Ask me what my favourite dish is
Either pussy or the fishes
Pussy, pussy or the fishes
Ye, yeah, its either pussy or the fishes

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg ]
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
Ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
It's the bodega cat and I'm back in the house
What, wha, wha, what, what's it all about
Ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
Ma, ma, ma, ma, meow
It's the uptown cat and I'm back up in the house

*meow*
