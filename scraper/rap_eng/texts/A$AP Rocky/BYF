[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I just, I just wanna be your friend
(I just, I just)
I just, I, I, I just wanna be your friend
(I just, I)
And I, and I- menage with me and your girlfriend
This new sensation won't feel the same again

[Verse 1: A$AP Ant]
Trying to fuck you and your friend shawty
Trying to put a dick in your bitch, I'm sorry
Care about the bitch, pass that to Carti
Playing with the money like the game Atari
Might go to Saks Fifth, might go to Barney's
MarGielaa, on me looking so clean
Young nigga clean like Listerine
Got a new shawty from the Philippines
Riding real slow, still getting this dough
Celine on my Oscars 'cause I gotta stay low
Smoking on Fronto, you're still smoking dro
Feel on the girls in the Uber Tahoe
When I pull up it's a car show
Neon lights, my car glow
Big bank like Wells Fargo
Trying to get a Murcielago

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I just, I just wanna be your friend
(I just, I just)
I just, I, I, I just wanna be your friend
(I just, I)
And I, and I- menage with me and your girlfriend
This new sensation won't feel the same again

[Verse 2: Smooky Margielaa]
I just wanna be your friend
Come through, we could count hundreds, no 10s
Come chill with Margielaa man
What you wanna ride? Got a Bentley in the back
Ayy, baby in a Benz now
Now she wanna pull up in a Phantom
Back on
Ever since she don't gotta stress
Blue bills in my pocket Benjamins
Diamonds on my wrist, shine glistening
You came with the shawty in the rented whip
I fucked up my shawty in expensive shit
Buy her anything she need
Fly her out to Germany
She post pictures I retweet
Give her shit she never seen, ayy

[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I just, I just wanna be your friend
(I just, I just)
I just, I, I, I just wanna be your friend
(I just, I)
And I, and I- menage with me and your girlfriend
This new sensation won't feel the same again
