Me, bitch I’m me, I'm the goddamn reason you ain't VIP CEO
I’m young wild and strapped like Charlie

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky)

Catch me posted on 1 40 if you’re…
My … is all about the buisness
Ice in my grill, my jeweler is my dentist
Got a neck full of carrots and a pocket full of spinach
But tell me what’s for dinner, y’all niggas is beginners
You fucking with them losers and my team full of winners
D’s on that bitch, we never ride spinners
My birds down south even if it ain’t winter
And I’m a skinny nigga, but to see if my show’s real
Walk to the club, ugly mug like hell rell
Mike’s in my palm on my arm like ll
I’ma put the city on my back like…
King kong in the trunk beat you 12-12
That’s a 12 gauge handed by the 12th grade
And I’m from Harlem so you know we fly high
Buckle up ma you rollin' with a fly guy, cause

Bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me
I’m ceo, I’m ceo
I’m young wild and strapped like Charlie
Bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me, bitch I’m me
I’m ceo, I’m ceo
