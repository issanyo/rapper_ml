First off
Shift off
Get high lift off
Sold models look at the gold bottles
Thought it was Cristal but after that I'm like "Criss Cross"
Jump jump got the punk, got the funk
Got it packed
From the back, to the front
What you want?
Leave you slumpted
Know me I'm a leaker got the sneaker
See a diva and she painting for a feature
Senorita Nice to meet ya
I don't care I carry pick wards
Got a tweaker and you wanna mess hit you up with a twizer
Listen jesus skizer

And I never had to leave her
And I leave her at my leisure, please her
I hit you with a teaser sorry gotta go
It's was nice to meet you
Chill ah hahahaha
