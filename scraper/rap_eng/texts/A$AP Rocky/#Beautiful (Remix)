[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
It's like our first date
Time past fast, like the flash of a blink
A little Chardonnay, lingerie and a mink
All I could think (Uh, uh, you're beautiful)
So don't complain when I'm in home late
A couple loose lips and the ship gon' sink
Don't even try to act like your shit don't stink
But still... ASAP!
Hold up wait, hit both brakes
Fuck third base 'cus I hit home plate
I'mma party hard like the disco days
Fat black plaques and them french fold braid
Cause homie pack steel, like below waist
Shawty got grill, like Chipotle
Now my favorite meal be the shrimp lo mein
But still... (You're beautiful)

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you’re killing me, you know it ain’t fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you’re killing me, baby do it again

[Hook: Miguel]
You’re beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You’re beautiful, good lord, you’re fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Mariah Carey]
I like when you run red lights
Don’t stop ’til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know
But I don’t care, take me anywhere
‘Cause it’s beautiful, ooh you make me feel invincible
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah

[Hook: Miguel & Mariah Carey]

[Outro]
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
You don’t know what you’re doing darling
Hop on back my bike darling
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Don’t you worry darling
