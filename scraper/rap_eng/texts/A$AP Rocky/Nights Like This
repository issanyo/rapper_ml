[Intro]
FUBU got that flame

[Refrain]
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Nights like this, nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops will fall

[Verse]
Fall down from the sky
Fall down, not a thing in the air
I don't even know how we got here
Feelin' like five heartbeats
Nights like this
Nowadays, couldn't have the low price like this, uh
Swear you couldn't have a wife like this, uh
Jewelers don't make the ice like this
They don't shine bright-bright like this
You don't think twice-twice like this
Night-night
Nights like this, I just wish
Raindrops gon' fall all down my wall
Raindrops gon' fall all down my wall-

[Refrain]
Nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops will
Nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Nights like this
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Nights like this
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish
Nights like this
Raindrops with nights like this, I wish

[Outro]
Fubu got that flame
