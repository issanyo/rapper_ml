[Intro: Jaden Smith]
Pyroman
Hey, wait, come again
Wait, hey, uh

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Me and Rocky sip the sake up in Paris eating calamari
Me and Carti at a party with some shawties, say what's up to Bari, ayy
Vandalizing your Ferrari, am I hating? No, I roll with Cartier
Sippin' Dom Pérignon, whole squad's on Perrier

[Verse 1: ASAP Rocky]
Out in Paris like I'm Perry Ellis, Parisian people love parasailing
Parallel park the 911, Parisian stones, fuck yo VVS's
United Kingdom with the French connection
French kissin' and Parisian sexin'
French girls, French fries, French toast, French Goyard er'ry day

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Me and Rocky sip the sake up in Paris eating calamari
Me and Carti at a party with some shawties, say what's up to Bari, ayy
Vandalizing your Ferrari, am I hating? No, I roll with Cartier
Sippin' Dom Perignon, whole squad's on Perrier

[Verse 2: Playboi Carti]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh
Rocking that tee with a V
Fucking that bitch out the T and the V, ooh
Ducking the T-M the Z, ooh
Fashion week bitch overseas, ooh
Fucking my team for the week, ya
Fucking my team with no fee, ya
Fucking my team for the free, ya
Ayy, ayy, yeah

[Verse 3: A$AP Nast]
Fuck bein' humble
Little bitch, I'm from the jungle, ayy (word)
Haters talk down but every time they do
They always fucking mumble (word, word)
Lil nigga, when you talkin' to a boss
Watch how you're talkin' (word)
Cause I got some niggas that pull up right now
And put you in a coffin (blrrt buck bow!)
Yeah, put 'em in a coffin
I ain't playin' with these niggas, uh
Nasty back and I'm bossin' (boss)

[Chorus: Jaden Smith]
Me and Rocky sip the sake up in Paris eating calamari
Me and Carti at a party with some shawties, say what's up to Bari, ayy
Vandalizing your Ferrari, am I hating? No, I roll with Cartier
Sippin' Dom Pérignon, whole squad's on Perrier
