[Intro]
Damn, I miss my nigga man
Damn, I miss my nigga man (fuck)
Damn, I miss my-
Yeah we gonna shine, get some money, pour a four
Staying is my grind, I've been drinking on the low
Pour up lean and sigh, hope I see you when you go
[?]
I was on the side, always hurtin’ on the low (stay alive)
I can sense you're silent, crying on the floor
No need to be silent, see a lot go (woo!)

[Chorus]
That's my nigga (woo!)
Man I miss my- my realest nigga (woo!)
Mad they took my nigga
Yeah my nigga, yeah my nigga, yeah
Yeah my nigga, yeah my nigga, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
How do we celebrate? In loving memory
How do we celebrate? In loving memory
I should go defecate, just to set records straight
[?] Hope you in a better place
How do we celebrate? In loving memory

[Verse 2]
Police shut my mind down, visit on my free time
Ricky facing fair time, celebrate the mean time
I’mma hold it down
I'mma pop a bottle, another round to go around
I'mma hold it down
I'mma fuck this model, never hold it down around
Always on a head-high, police on a head-lock
Niggas acting red now, I can't think in red now
Smoking cigarettes now, I ain't got no regrets now
Living on the edge now, life with no regrets now

[Chorus]
That's my nigga (woo!)
Man I miss my- my realest nigga (woo!)
Mad they took my nigga
Yeah my nigga, yeah my nigga, yeah
Yeah my niggas, yeah my nigga, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
How do we celebrate? In loving memory
How do we celebrate? In loving memory
I should go defecate, just to set records straight
Hope you in a better place
How do we celebrate? In loving memory
