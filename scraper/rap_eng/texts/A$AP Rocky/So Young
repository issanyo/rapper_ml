[Verse 1: John Gourley, Zoe Manville & A$AP Rocky]
So young, just begun
Don't need to live to know what I've become
When ya wake up, still in your make up
You'll make it home just fine without breaking down
Man, that's so young, that's so young
Stay calm, we'll all just get along
Sit around, pretendin' like nothing's wrong
So long, love letter (Letter)
But you and I are gonna live forever

[Chorus: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
I don't need to make amends
But I'm done going undercover
I just want to find a friend
I don't need another lover
One day the world may end
But there's still plenty to discover
'Til then I'll just pretend
I don't need another lover

[Verse 2: John Gourley, Zoe Manville & A$AP Rocky]
So young, loaded gun
Oblivious to what the trigger does
When you wake up, never gonna make up
Got ammunition on a mission we're gonna shoot you down
Man, that's so young, that's so young
Knocked out with the Midas touch
A champion wearing golden gloves
Got ya punch drunk, seeing stars
Little birdies singing, "Why'd ya fall so hard?"

[Chorus: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
I don't need to make amends
But I'm done going undercover
I just want to find a friend
I don't need another lover
One day the world may end
But there's still plenty to discover
'Til then I'll just pretend
I don't need another lover

[Bridge: John Gourley]
My light burning bright
Everlong 'til the thrill is gone
Love's my battle cry
It's never wrong
How I stay so strong
I'll fight all my life
I'm all like I can't go on
When I can't go on
We're gonna live forever
We're gonna live forever

[Chorus: John Gourley & Zoe Manville]
I don't need to make amends
But I'm done going undercover
I just want to find a friend
I don't need another lover
Today the world will end
You never know we may recover
No time left to pretend
I don't need another lover

[Outro: John Gourley & A$AP Rocky]
Oh... it's troubling
When the belly of the beast starts rumbling
Oh... it's getting too hot
Like it's summer in the city that we're living in
Oh... it's troubling
When the belly of the beast starts rumbling
Oh... it's getting too hot
Like it's summer in the city that we're living in
Feeling so young...
