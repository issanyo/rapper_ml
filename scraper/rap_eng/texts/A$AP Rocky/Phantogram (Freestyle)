Marble floors, foreign whores, finna order more
Play that French Montana song, the one with Ross (Haaan!)
Ordered new Raf, it ain't from the store
Came with a piece, bangin' peace if it come to war
She takin' somethin' off, what you stuntin' for?
Fix your WonderBra, my style is rubbin' off
Swear that pussy Oasis if I'm in it raw
Out in London Town paintin' all the wonderwalls
Yeah I'm underdog, spring, summer, fall, winter
Niggas run to law, gun in drawers, gettin' bundles off
Takin' trips to Baltimore, with the raw, door to door
Fender boss, want the vintage Porsche with the oven doors
I just wanna have a little fun with y'all
But on the real, no, I kill folk
Growin' up I had a best friend who used to mail coke
Successful with the shit until the day they heard the seal broke
My other partner got a million dollars and he's still broke
My thot a primadonna and she whinin' cause her nail broke
Niggas comin' at me sideways like they heel broke
And I'm just glad I ain't ever gotta deal dope
Cause the vision was this tradition and pants
Whole squad in this bitch, all we missin' is Yams

Caught a wish and got bitches in France
Chain swing, see the king and they kissin' my hand
