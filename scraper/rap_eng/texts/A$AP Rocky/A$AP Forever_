*Not finished

[Verse]
Come fuck with the Mob
Shout out to Lords and the Gods
In love with Cait cause she bi (Huh)
My ice like the stars, I tell the Sun cover your eyes
‘Cause smoking with J you go blind
She losing her mind
I'm F'n yo girl wit no cond
Telling my girl to go blonde
Last night was real dark, I can’t even open my blinds
On me and that’s word to my mom
Ima real mad man
Wit niggas I’m still tryna beat, a buncha shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, now yell geronimo
It is your time to go, adios vamanos
A$AP crew and you know we got Hella hoes
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I’m not living like I’m suppose'
NXT said "It's called livin" shit I suppose
I’m on my live alone die alone
You talking about spending and buying clothes
I’m talking bout business when I’m alone
I still have the vision I Neva choke
Fucking on Diamond and foreign hoes
Getting these women to blow my hose
I win a lot that's the way it goes
I put ASAP on my back “woo”
Faith had put me on the map “Sorry”
I promise my gang is so flame “woo”
Don't even know my girl name
"D" robbing boys for the chain “woo”
I know $linger got my back “woo”
$4UC3Y got a 6-pack “woo”
Nilu$ got a boo in the back

[Hook]
Cuz they talking down on my name
Don't let em run off I'm her mane
Man you don't run wit da gang
A$AP boys came wit the flame
Gang, gang, they talking down on the gang
But it's on they girls I came
Gang,gang, you boys ain't flexing ya lame
I'm. done adjusting to fame
Put it on my set leave a stain
Gang,gang I tell T come fuck wit da gang
I tell her give me and J brain
Jayyy,Malek,NiKeS,Killa,the gang
