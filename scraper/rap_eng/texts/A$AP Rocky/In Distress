[Hook: A$AP Rocky]
I'm something out this world, nothing like the rest
Nigga, win the fair game, fuck with the best
Just a kid with the grown men, rep to protect
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress

[Verse 1: A$AP Rocky]
I'm coming for your neck, hey, I ain't indirect
They in debt, pay respect, now I'm coming to collect
They regret what they said, that's when I become a threat
Make a bet that the next time you niggas come correct
This the type of music make a nigga flex
Start so gangster, move it throwing up the set
All the pretty niggas feeling only breasts
And the government are cutting only checks
Everybody stressed

[Hook]

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
If knowledge is power and power is knowledge
And then you divide and conquer, I devoured and conquered
The youth is my environment, inspire responsibly
But they rather drop it like it's hot, that wobbity wobbity
If you ever thought of robbing me, my mob on me probably
I believe this highway robbery, get the fuck out the driver's seat
Honestly part of the problem, you deprived of your privacy
This is private property, you part of the poverty
You forced just like the prophecy, that's part of the policy
Obviously just plain technology, democracy's mockery
My doc made a hypothesis, he said that I'm obsolete
The power of the God in me, no telling what I'mma be

[Hook]
