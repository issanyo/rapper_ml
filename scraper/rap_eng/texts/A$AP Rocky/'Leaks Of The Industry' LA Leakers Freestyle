[Verse 1]

Uh
Flocko tell me what your name is
High like chains ever since you became famous
And you know these bitches in my way theys the lamest
And my old bitches they be always on that same shit
Niggas who i hang with gang bang with me
On that same shit that gang bang shit
And i let my chain swish and i let the lane switch
When i do it is so dangerous
Hit you with that stainless
Nigga why you playing
Nigga what you saying
I be spraying aks and techs with Rolex
Roll through your jet
Show no respect then call Geoff
Call the sheriff
Niggas no i did it for the trillist
I dont give a fuck about your feelings if you feel us
Shout out to my killers
We the realest one hundred dollar billers
For willers out the mother fucking
Ass
Nigga kiss my ass
Your bitch love my swag
And i got money out the ass
Cash up in the back
I remember last year
I ain't have a diamond sphere
But now look at me here
Got money longer than my hair
Got you bitch wanting to wear
Wanting to see my underwear
Never give a damn about your fear
I dont fear no i dont care
I dont give no mother fucking hater my time
Fuck that im in the state of my mind

And i do this for my leakers

Reeces pieces jesus pieces all up on my
Uh
Gillter chains and i let the mother fucking chitter bang
