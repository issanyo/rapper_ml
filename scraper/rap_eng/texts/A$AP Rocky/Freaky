[Intro]
Damn Davis
Drop that bitch
Shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Play me some of that $uicide Pimpin'
Juicemane, A$AP Rocky, $UICIDEBOY$
Y'all know what it is
Let's go

[Chorus: Juicy J & A$AP Rocky]
Do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs
Down on the floor
Do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs
Down on the floor
Do, do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs
Down on the floor
Do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs

[Verse 1: Juicy J]
Bitch, you know I like that freaky shit
I love a freaky bitch (get naked)
Just get nasty for a nigga
Bitch, I'm filthy rich
Don't stop, pop that pussy (pussy)
Make that money, baby (get money)
Fuck that conversation
Make them niggas compensate ya'
I'm in Magic City (city)
I'm grabbin' ass and titties (always)
I'm leaving King Of Diamonds
All them bitches leaving with me
Can't fuck in Tennessee
Bet them bitches remember me
I smoke a mild and make them
Pop a bean and drink that Hennessy
Hennything is possible
I got a lot to blow
White girls on a lot of blow
That's a lot of snow (cocaine)
Bitches love to bust it open
That's just what you gotta know
You ain't tryna pop it, hoe
Bitch, you know you gotta go
Cause down south girls love to

[Chorus: Juicy J & A$AP Rocky]
Do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs
Down on the floor
Do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs
Down on the floor
Do, do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs
Down on the floor
Do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
From the south, she got weed for sale
Fix your weave and nails
Out the house, she got lean for sale
Pink codeine and syrup
In the drought, come fuck for free, for real
But for me it's still on the house
I get it cheap for real without a re, you tell (run your mouth)
Hop in my vehicle, I put the d in tail
Burning out, I push the V6-12, I put the V in 12
200 miles, cuz' if I see the twelve
My speed won't leave a trail
Don't turn around
Cuz if I, if I, if I see the jail
Then I won't see you girl
If I, if I, if I meet your friend
Then I won't need you girl
If you, if you, if you give me threesome shit
Then I won't leave you girl
You gotta go, if you shy to ride a stripper pole
There it go, real niggas know
Real girls get down on the floor, on the floor

[Chorus: Juicy J & A$AP Rocky]
Do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs
Down on the floor
Do them freaky thangs
Down south girls love to do them freaky thangs

[Break: RUBY DA CHERRY]
Aye, Ruby da—, Ruby da—, Ruby da—, aye

[Verse 3: RUBY DA CHERRY]
I once knew this hoe named Margaret
Who thought that she was hard to get
Then when she wanted somethin', yeah, I bought her it
Ruby beat the pussy with a bat!—yeah, he slaughter it
Cuttin' up like back in fucking class, but I'm smarter, bitch
Curve a fucking hoe 'cause she a duck, and no, I want no part of it
It's still "fuck a hoe", she think my dick some sort of parlor trick
It's still run a whore over with the foreign drip
Ask her how the tires fuckin' taste, yeah, that's the start, lil' bitch
Ruby got the big body Benz, ain't no parking it
She want them kids inside her pussy, but there ain't no parkin' it, uh

[Verse 4: $CRIM]
Slob on my knob, lil' bitch, do your job
Suck it with the skin, while you fuck the whole team
Rob you out your pockets, whistle up the code
All my partners dipped in gold, hit my little bottom, bitch
Lesbo in the closet, still bouncin' like hydraulics
Six-fo' knockin', all these hoes like Death Row '94
Black, Asian, Persian, even white girls
Skinny savage pimp with a mink coat, walkin' with a limp
Cut Throat, Rocky, Plague, and Uncle Juicemane
Still fuck a hoe
And that's goin' to the grave, that's goin' to the grave
