[Intro: A$AP Twelvyy, Sampha, & A$AP Rocky]
Window down and we're caught in flight
Window down and we're caught in flight
Window down and we're caught in flight
You can let the breeze, let the breeze cool you
Yeah, shit fell up in my lap
I was sellin' packs
I wouldn't really worry 'bout no raps
I was movin' straps
This is all facts (Way way back nigga)
Me and [Dame?] tried it to the max 'cause these monkeys on our back
Anything bling gettin' snatched

[Interlude: A$AP Rocky]
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, fuck that Twelv
Don’t talk to these niggas, nah, now it’s time to show these niggas. Show these niggas like a movie, nigga!

[Verse 1]
Yeah, this shit fell up in my lap
I was sellin' packs
I wouldn't really worry 'bout no raps
I was movin' straps
This is all facts
Me and Dame tried it to the max
Got these monkeys on our backs
Anything bling? gettin' snatched
If it's what I've seen then it's taxed
You can ask who was on they ass, I was livin' fast
Fuck a casket, had a mask and a automatic
Wasn't safe, no cameras, no case
And every ghetto nigga pump strays
Had to duck a few, now I'm at the W
Prolly light up a few if I'm feeling comfortable
Paranoia got me watching all my friends
I make it out this Hell I'll never sin again
It's probably a lie 'cause I'd do it all again
'Cause everything I've done gave me fuel just to win
Gotta peep the vision

[Hook: Sampha]
If there's a monster inside of here
Well I'm gonna keep it clear
I wish it would take all these things and go
There's no more we need to know
We fade out

[Verse 2]
See Dame got shot, then he got locked up
Pootie got popped, then she got knocked up
I was on the block, choc'd, all rocked up
Now I'm with The Mob, Diddy woppin' with some Clockers
Ask who can stop us, hoppin' out with choppers
Poppin' like we Poppa 'cause we got this city rockin'
'pproach us? ain't an option
All this pain, all this fame, got me drinkin' all this ‘pagne
In the club to myself
Thinkin' 'bout the days I was stealth
I was in the hall raisin' Hell
Young 12, frame a little frail, but I had the belt
Loudmouth nigga, but I'm down to make you melt
Hot Boy, rollin' with the Juveniles
Prolly with a shooter now, got a new Ruger now
'Cause Life's a bitch, and I'm goin' through it now
Everyday's do or die, hesitate, lose it now

[Hook: Sampha]
If there's a monster inside of here
Well I'm gonna keep it clear
I wish it would take all these things and go
There's no more we need to know
We fade out
If there's a monster inside of here
Well I'm gonna keep it clear
I wish it would take all these things and go
There's no more we need to know
