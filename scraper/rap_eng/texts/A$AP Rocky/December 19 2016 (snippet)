[Lyrics from Snippet]

I see things in my sleep
This past week [?]
I'm on a cloud
[?]

[Verse 1]
I think they runnin' out of rappers to compare me with
Ain't a bitch out bad enough to pair me with
Usually only fuck with niggas that you hear me with
My jewelry dance like rubies skipping on canary bricks
On some donkey shit, nigga I bought me this
Shooters love me from Canal up to 40th
