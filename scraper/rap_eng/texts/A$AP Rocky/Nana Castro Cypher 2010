(Verse 1 Rocky)
I said I'm on to that next shit
You lookin' at the bestest
Married to the game
Treat you niggas like my step-kids
Pull up in that Porsche
Niggas feel nausea
Didn't write the rules, but my status like the arthur
Just crashed the Range, so I pulled the Bent out
Prolly gettin' brains, chillin' in my Penthouse
Slackin' on ya mackin', and I'm 'bout to lay my pimp down
Christian Louboutin, red bottom come in men's now
On to the next one, skinny jeans fit in
Pull up to these shows, and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
But little do she know, I got a big ego
Automatic weapon, need to order a protection
Killing feelings on these records
So my charges is molesting
And assault with deadly weapons got these rappers feeling threatened
Ain't a hip hop veteran, I'm a hip hop felon

(Verse 2 Rocky)
I need a crib by the mountains
Chest look house lit
Limbs get frostbit
Brand new outfits
If you less fortunate, you really ain't about shit
So much cribs, a nigga friends got to house sit
So much money, can't weigh it by the ounce shit
Weigh it by the pound shit, too much to count shit
Paparazzi taking pictures
Newspaper topics, magazines gossip
Villa in the tropics
Rockstar pop shit, made by toxic
Inside hot pink, outside gothic
Rag-top roof made of fishnet stockings
Black candy paint look fingernail polish

(Verse 3 Rocky)
No one in this sight has swag like I do
Church with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel
Hit em with the rifle, I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower
Hustle harder, snow, sleet, showers
Age worry about who's hot and who's hotter
Like crabs in the barrel tryna pull you to the bottom
You get em, I got em
Point him out, I spot em
Red dot em, I shot em
I hide em, you find him
Roll to the club, and I order gold bottles
Shawty get low, but I'm no Flo-rida
And this 6-4 spokes like a lowrider
The coups so special, you could call it mo-rida
But I'm a known rider, and I'm a provider
Black on black Bent, fire like the Ghost Rider
Don't need a ghostwriter because my flow's tighter
Your careers nose diving, I'mma pull an allnighter
So hood rich, Hollywood bitch want me
Don't look hood but a hood bitch love me
Hood niggas hate Hollywood niggas hate me
Prolly why I never keep the burner off safety
You could never ugh, you should never try to play me
On a scale of one-to-ten, sick is what they rate me
No homo, but these labels wanna rape me
I tell em four words:
Fuck you. Pay me
