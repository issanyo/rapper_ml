Red lights, yellow lights, green lights

Molly tabs, acid tabs
Take that shit straight to the brain
Turnin' up with my old niggas

Dope, dope, dope, dope, woo!

[Verse 2: A$AP Rocky]
I might let her sit in the Ghost, uh
Fight for my 'tention the most (dope)
Liking my pics when I post (dope)
Might put my dick in her throat
Throat, throat, throat, throat
I admit I'm kinda wired
Eyes open wide, even when I'm tired
Go to sleep to lullabies
Wake up to menage, panties to the side (side)
Fifty thousand for the coat
Another fifty in the yellow envelope (woah!)
Prolly thought a nigga broke
Never clipped the bros, walking, smoking dopes (splash)

[Verse 3: A$AP Twelvyy]
Yo, mixing these chemicals, send it through
Elements, diamonds and minerals
Pelicans high on the residue
God, it's incredible, chopper leave vegetables
Taking a trip and I'm spacing out
Look at my life and my bank account
Chopper not working, I'm hanging out
Shooters on deck and they banging out (banging out)
Yah, first of the fifth on the morning trip
First in the morning, I'm buyin' lunch
Flacko got zips of the Skittles
Not living no riddles, you point and I line 'em up (yo)
Smoking the dope, got a package from Hope
Got the pack for the low, got the crack for the low
Got a package and still got the gat
That go 'bout that action, we clappin' like after the show

[Hook: Karmah]
Ridin' round town, smoking dope, we smoking dope

Sour aqua foolie rollin' up that sweet tart
I don't understand it why you goin' so hard
Bitch I'm big belly Karmah get the fuck out my yard

Damn the corner store just ran out of god damn Swishers
Old school dump just the city don't cease

Boofin' this puff not that pass
Might catch me off of the tab
This some shit that be makin me laugh
Yo bitch a pain in my ass
Pimp that hoe out'n  take her cash
This life is up for the grabs
On the dirt road in the back eating blue crabs
Keep a low cut ain't no snakes in the grass
Old head out front bust a cap in your ass
Watch where you walk the dogs shit in the grass
Out in the sticks the best place for a trap
Keef goin ham, I chill with the fam
We move as a unit you know im not losing
That fafa abuse ya', pray God bless the Ruger
My brother my shooter, blood sink in a cooler
Blood thicker than water, can't fade no impostor
Real wet like an otter, lock up your daughter
She roll at my concert, the weather gets hotter
Now she go topless, she think I am hot shit
Don't want none these problems
Sell hope like Obama s' , shit-bagging with condoms
I can when it's awesome, hey

One time I bought a sheet and bussed that bitch down like four ways
If you catch me out in traffic man you might just smell my haze
But you won't catch me lackin' send some missiles to your brain (hey)
Do not give a fuck we rollin' L and puffin J's
Big 'Ol Chevy truck pull up like I own the place
I think I need a cape they say Stevekeef done saved the day
Gettin to the guap you can't make too many plays
This the way of the outlaw live free and get paid
(gang!)

Ridin' round town, smoking dope, we smoking dope

[Verse 6: Stevekeef]
Splash
And it's still free tha' gang
I'm committed man i need a wedding ring
He said "big homie go do your thing"
Big DMT make you go insane
Little LSD to leave your soul untamed
Smoke THC up out a gas tank
I laugh my whole way to the bank
I got good dope I got good hoes
I got silent shooters who are trained to go
Fish scale go head bring a pole
Best get a rag for that snotty nose
(lets go)

Ride around town smokin' dope man I'm smokin' dope
Ride around town smokin' dope man I'm smokin' dope
Smokin' dope, smokin' dope
