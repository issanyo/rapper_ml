Intro
I'm so high, you so high
I'll be gettin' money 'til the day that I die
I'm so high, you so high
I'll be gettin' money 'til the day that I die

Verse 1
Behold the uncontrollable
I keep the whole world in drama
Smoke my competition now they just a bag of skama
Imma reload the vocab that Manson used
Now amateurs will play to O.J
And wonder why they lose
I subdued the microphone and left it in submission
Then cracked the philly open
And found a talent that was hidden
I kid no man is similar to mental migraine
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game
It's been a long time maybe too long
Since your audio produced a real rap song
I mock a man who's fountain on a jack up in the plan
He can scan but didn't analyze the whole pro jam
I took my time I found I couldn't wait to explain
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game

Chorus [Repeat x4]
I'm so high, you so high
I'll be gettin' money 'til the day that I die

Verse 2
The new and improved
You can't make a move
Or elude the feud about to be cued
A soloist journey through the mist now found
Assassinate the sound with choke by the pound
Make my own type of home on the phone
MC's reachin' for my style I'll leave alone
My terminology and odyssey known to man
And counteract the sham I'm cooler than a fan
Split the fission I cut with precision
So many tried before but still couldn't get in
Now it's on
No need to explain
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya game

Chorus [Repeat x4]

I'm high 'til I die so there's no need to lie
Pass that metal over to the small guy
Kickin' inside from desire
Mils will be the ammos all explodin' on the mic to fuel the fire
I'm lifted off of my wig like terrific
Target every market move on each one specific
Overload the frame but keep it all the same
The Masta I.C. enters now in the game
Play me and try to get away that's a maybe
Be da foe and I'mma hold a 9 to ya lady
Our style's like a weapon
I hit the untrue
No need for me to come stalkin' lookin' for you
I rip through ya heart and bust through ya veins
I guarantee that things will never ever be the same
I kicked it on the real and now I keep it on the plane
The Masta I.C. enters now in ya brain
I'm so high...

Chorus [Repeat x4]
