Verse One: Mic Geronimo

Another Day of stepping through the Belly of the beast
I leave the compound and make my way to my stomping ground
Im just about broke to the letter
It can't get any worse shit can only get better
My bruner lampin' by my waistline
Geronimo will be fine
My niggas got my back and undefined
So now I unwind and keep my focus on my schedule
It's critical for me to run a scan on my plans
I keep steppin
And on the DL I'll be well
And as the ??? chicks will be ??? as possible
I make a red bone a dead bone
After my bed bone, I'll leave her ass sewn from my tone

(still working on it, this dude can be real unintelligible for a non native)
