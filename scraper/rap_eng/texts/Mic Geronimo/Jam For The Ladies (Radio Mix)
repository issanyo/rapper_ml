Living on my Gucci it's about that time
For me and all my good looking women to arrive
Motorola Tex all friends of mine
Ballin cos the sex is on my mind
Stuff up your jeans, step in the beam
Make sure dem two shoes is clean
We gonna ride on the cruisin' speed
Pink cadillacs and the gangsta lean
Hit the balls, adjust the balls
