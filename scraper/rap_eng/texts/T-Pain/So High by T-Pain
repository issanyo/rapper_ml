:: Verse 1 ::
You can KNOCK on my door
But ain't nobody home
I might be there
But im GONE cause im stuck off a Zone
Im Half baked like the Guy on the couch

So i puff on my line and be out
I call my roll dogg pick me up
Wit weed lets hit the road dawg
You blew up wit the hood rat
The FUCK u break the code fo!?
God damn i think that im high
Too much haze
But i see my ghost pass within the blink of a eye
And my ghetto niggas know how it feel
I smoke more than a building on fire
Roll more than the wheel

Suddenly everything was movin in slow motion

:: CHorus ::

CJ beatin on my back
Somebody help me i think im about to die
But i got it
