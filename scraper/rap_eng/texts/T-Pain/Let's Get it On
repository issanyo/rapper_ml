[Intro]
Let's get it on tonight... {*4X*}
Yah, check it, okay

[T-Pain]
(Let's get it on)
It seems as if you just talkin it and don't know what to do
(Let's get it on)
I can feel you clinchin got your body flinchin when I'm touchin you
(Let's get it on)
Girl you know I got that good thang, you wouldn't understand it's a hood thang
(Let's get it onnnn)
You can walk the walk, but can youu talk the talk?
This what you should say

[Hook]
(Let's get it on tonight)
Five foot five, got my eyes so wide and I'm holdin that
(Let's get it on tonight)
I can see it in your eyes, you want me behind so you can throw it back
(Let's get it on tonight)
I cain't even lie, I got a need for your thighs, nothin wrong with that
(Let's get it on tonight)
Girl is you feelin me? You killin me; you feelin me? You killin me
You feelin me? (Let's get it on tonight)

[T-Pain]
I ain't gotta worry 'boutcha
You can handle everythang that I'm givin you
(Let's get it on)
Even if I saw your face in a darker place I would be feelin you
(Let's get it on)
Look I ain't no virgin shawty
I can hurt yoour body, you done heard about me
(Let's get it onnnn)
You can walk the walk, but can youu talk the talk?
This what you should say

[Hook]

[T-Pain]
Girl you fine ass hell
Momma done you well, I see it in yo' face
(Let's get it on)
I'mma beat you down like a twelve; bah-dah... bah-dah, bah-dah
(Let's get it on)
You in for a treat, I'mma sweep you off of your feet
(Let's get it onnnn)

Bave you feelin like you higher than a kite girl
