[Intro: T-Pain]
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: Alex Aiono]
Obviously you got problems with me
And we're probably not gonna solve 'em
Obviously you're not talking to me
Hit the silent treatment, girl, you got 'em
Laid back in the Maybach
Got that ice all on your collar
Give 'em back if you don't want 'em
You know I start from the bottom

[Pre-Chorus 1: Alex Aiono]
Baby, you're making the rules up, the rules up
You changed my life, girl, I put the 2's up, the 2's up
I made you comfortable, you put your shoes up, your shoes up
Baby, just go ahead through your list
But I just wanna hear that shit

[Chorus: Alex Aiono]
One at a time, ooh
One at a time, ooh
One at a time, ooh
I know that everything is my fault
But just bring it all up one at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
I know that everything is my fault
But just bring it all up one at a time

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Seriously, she won't listen to me
What's the issue with me and my baby?
Seriously, it's just getting to me
This shit really got me going crazy
Late nights in the Wraith
Might be the thing that's got you so lazy
Memory must've got hazy
Hennessy done got you faded

[Pre-Chorus 2: T-Pain]
Why you keep bringing them dudes up, them dudes up?
I changed your life, I put 22's up on your new truck
You know my money longer than a school bus
It ain't for you, but I can't wait 'til I hear some of this list
But I just wanna hear this shit

[Chorus: T-Pain & Alex Aiono]
One at a time, ooh
One at a time, ooh
One at a time, ooh
I know that everything is my fault
But just bring it all up one at a time (yeah, yeah), oh
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
I know that everything is my fault
But just bring it all up one at a time

[Bridge: Alex Aiono & T-Pain]
Baby, you know I ain't perfect
So let's put it all on the surface
And I can tell you I'm worth it
But I'm gonna show you it one at a time
You know that you're special
And sometimes I could be forgetful
But I can make the longest list telling you that you're the shit

[Chorus: Alex Aiono]
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
I know that everything is my fault
But just bring it all up one at a time
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
One at a time (one at a time, yeah, yeah), oh
I know that everything is my fault
But just bring it all up one at a time

[Outro: Alex Aiono & T-Pain]
One at a time, yeah, yeah
One at a time, yeah, yeah
One at a time, yeah, yeah
One at a time, at a time
Oh...
I know that everything is my fault but just bring it all up
