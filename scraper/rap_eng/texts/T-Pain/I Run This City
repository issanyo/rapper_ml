[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey you know I'm mad, so what I do
So why would you test that, why would you test that?
Now I done told everybody we da best
Now show me where the rest at, show me where the rest at
I'm tryina make the whole city bounce, bounce bounce motherfucker
I'm the king where I'm from and that's that, that's that
Hey now I run this city and I'm a keep runnin'
I'mma keep runnin' but I'm never runnin' out of money, uh-uh

[Verse 1: Trae Tha Truth]
King of the city tell them haters I run it
13 years in this bitch I'm crowned it they many who done it
I'm saluting the south, the hood nigga say I'm one hundred
My facility is the streets only rapper that funded
A couple haters nothing major they don't get attention
They probably mad I stay on fire like the devil's kitchen
And while they playin' I just cop the chain of three dimension
Like a bitch eatin' pussy niggas in the fuck position
In this city I'm authentic my section is valid
We the best and niggas know it, I yell it like Khaled
Ain't no debatin', if I speak motherfuckers respect it
You say be in and you go motherfucking chicken

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trae Tha Truth]
I'm the heart of this bitch so why the fuck would you test it?
Tell 'em I got this bitch on lock like something got arrested
If you mention Houston [?]
Paparazzi flashin', I tint the whip and I [?]
Black on black on this black foes, black designers and black clothes
Hop in up out this black Rolls, suicide on this back doors
I'm in this gutter way bellow, it ain't too many lower
And a foreign bitch without her clothes tryna get some exposure
I'm the general in my city, frontline I'm a soldier
You play with me and I could make you where nobody know you
Tell 'em that money talking and I don't plannin' on shuttin' up
I'm try'na make this motherfucker bounce until I fuck it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Trae Tha Truth]
They know I'm pissed off why the fuck would they play?
Their opinion don't mean a thing when they come to fuckin' with Trae
I show them this middle finger, them fuck niggas is gay
Niggas yellin their time is coming I tell em it ain't today
Okay I am G and bitch I'm a stress that
I'm the business, show me where the rest at
I got that nigga so where they next at
When they come to competition it's understood I'm a rip that
Speaking of fit I pick something the size of Texas
Catch one of these fuck niggas get brick and on some other shit
My [?] OG, it ain't opened for questions
It's serious like these diamonds and niggas flexin' on some other shit

[Hook]
