{*jail door slams shut*}
Konvict

[T-Pain]
Ay, that's how it go mayne
Sheeit, that's how it go mayne
Ay man I know y'all feelin like can't touch me dog
But I'm right here, I ain't goin nowhere dog
Yeah, yeah, sheeit I'm just a rapper turned sanger man
What you is dog? I'm just a rapper turned sanger man {*2X*}
Ay, what you is dog? Don't even worry 'bout it

Ay, now let me tell you a lil' story 'bout this young rapper man
Shit, from the start in his heart, he had a passion to sing
What a passionate mayne, rapper, producer, a whole stack of thangs
And then one day he said to himself you know a man has to change
So now he a rapper, a sanger~! A dancer, a romancer~!
Man cancer can't be way mo' too serious
I'm tryin to drop this real but they ain't hearin this
They fearin this - used to all that shit that they hear on the radio
I bet'cha I catch the ear of somebody and they gon' play me though
So we came up, not givin a fuck, what a nigga gotta say 'bout Pain
Got niggas lil' ladies droppin their panties
Smackin their fannies, sayin his name
So I'm playin the game they want me to play
Sayin everything they want me to say
And I promised homeboy if I get back to this rappin it won't be today
Ain't got time for the rap shit, bap shit, makin hand clap shit
Nappy, nappy, nappy mo' nap shit
That shit second, this shit first
That shit harder, this shit worse
And this shit curse me and it hurts me to let it go
But I gotta come back to the sack to let these other niggas know
That it's another side to Teddy, a dub side on the machete
A fuckin prime spot on the Chevy, the situation gets heavy
So find it in your heart to let me put this gangbangin shit away
I've made it up in my mind that I'mma change today
A rapper turned sanger
