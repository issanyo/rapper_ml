It's goin digital, youse don't wanna hear me though
She lookin at me like she wanna be symmetrical
Fallin on yo' body, hit this and be quiet
Cause everybody in the club know I start the party
Just washed my shoes, the gators too clean
Don't mess around and make me have to +Do the Right Thing+
Aight, I'm digital, and you can come to MySpace
Or just call me when you're
