I can hear my baby saying my name
But I don't see my baby on time
Without you in here, it ain't the same
I don't mean a word I said to you last night

If you decided to pick up the phone, oh baby
I'll be waiting for you
Please tell me what's wrong, well I didn't mean to ignore you
Don't quit me baby I can fix it baby, baby
Being by myself is now my biggest fear

I can hear you telling to come home
But you might not even be there
We not gonna make it if I'm always gone, NO
Plus you told me you ain't going anywhere

If you decided to pick up the phone, oh baby
I'll be waiting for you
Please tell me what's wrong, well I didn't mean to ignore you
Don't quit me baby I can fix it baby, baby
Being by myself is now my biggest fear

When I come back, oh no
When I come back, yeah
When I come back, yeah yeah
When I come back, yeah yeah
