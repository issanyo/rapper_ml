This niggas hate what I makin but im still makin more
If you ain't about what you talking then fuck you fakin for
Rollin' weed with the homies duckin' the police
Drinking champagne mixing bombey
And my whole team smokin, Grade A ,kay kay

Live life like guns and roses
Go hard now work on pay
And I brought over hundred thou this ain't no cheap thrill
Heard its two thousand a bottle waitress can I get a

Yeah, of your time
Cause you're intoxicating my mind
Feel like a conversational lush
Cause I don't know how much is too much, yeah
I feel like the girl at the bar who's been there too long

You on the rocks
Cause I'm down to my very last drop

So can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?

Yeah!
Cause I feel like the girl at the bar who's been there too long
Can't stand up!
I should be gone, but I just can't get enough
So can I get a refill?
