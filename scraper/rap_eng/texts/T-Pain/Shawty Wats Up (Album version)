(chorus)=(mike)
Shawty wats up
Am in town for one night
I need somebody to come
Take a drink with me
Wats up
Am in mile 74
You might know were to go
Shawty what its gon be
If your with it tonight
You gotta let me know
Shawty wats up
Aha
She's with it tonight

(qwanell)
But then we poping champagne
Buying all the bottles
Shawty looking good
Something like a model
Gimme a week
Let me know when you finish
Got my bank roll on
Maybe you can help me spin it
Used to stare at night
Now you can get to business
If you know whats good(+2)
Normally i post up in or out
Cause my number shawty give me a car

(chorus)
(will)

Shawty want another drink
Get another bottle
Buying up the bar
Flying at tomorow
Give me a tab
Take you camping and go
One day i gotta fly up to my hood
We in the zone
Don't off that petrone
While the d.j still playing my song
I got the keys to the ride
8 shes certified
Shawty gotta ride with me

(chorus)
(Robert)
Girl i know you've been listening
Wishing you could be rolling with me
Well tonight is your chance
Cancel all your plans
You don't know what your missing
Till your give me ...
(i can take your number later on on on)
(when you see my number on your phone on on )
(you already know what it is )
So get yourself together whatever you wanna do
You could do it ain't nothing to it

(chorus)
