Goin on a trip, I'll be back home, boy I'll see you later
Goin back to a time when I know everything was straighter
And everything's great now but back then it was greater
And I don't need no clothes I go in just what I'm wearin
Matter fact I just go back to what I used to wear then
No matter how bad the weather, everything back then was just so better
I can dream, it's a simple thing; I'm buildin a time machine

[Hook 2X: T-Pain]
Back back back back back back back back in time
I can dream, it's a simple thing; I'm buildin a time machine

[T-Pain]
Yeah, goin back to a time when this music shit was more than business
Back to a time when I knew my niggas was down and if they still is
And I didn't have to worry 'bout what I got on when I go outsizzide
And I didn't have to worry 'bout what kind of car I got when I rizzide
And I didn't have to have 22's, 24's or 26's
And I didn't have to be forever surrounded by a million bitches
No matter how bad my life was, I still got love no matter how mad my wife was
I can dream, it's a simple thing; I'm buildin a time machine

[Hook]

[Outro: T-Pain]
Back back back back back back back back in time
Simple thing
Back back back back back back back back in time
It's a simple thing; buildin a time machine
