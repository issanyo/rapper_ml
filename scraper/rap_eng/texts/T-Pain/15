[Verse 1]
Man I been drinking, drinking all weekend, stunting
I be rolling up in that big body, I’m hunting
I’m feeling freaky, freaking a Costa Rican like it’s nothing
I’m drunk as fuck and that’s the end of my discussion
I’m a bad role model, now look at how I’m rolling
Ball so hard, look like everything stolen
But a nigga been hustling, a few budgets done got opened
I done brought a few hustlers in, got cocked back and reloaded
Now I’m getting at these hoes, getting at these hoes
I don’t give a fuck if they dimes, I’m throwing pennies at these hoes
But I might hit the strip club and get busy on these hoes
Or counting out some of these ones just depending on my mode

[Hook]
I'ma be like (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
I'ma be like (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
I'ma be like (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
I'ma be like (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Man I been styling, styling on these weak niggas for decades
They worry bout me and I’m just worried bout how to get paid
They get a few months in and they call me when their shit fade
But don’t call me nigga, keep listening to what that bitch say
I’m a threat to the industry, a hot commodity
Thots call me hot chocolate
When I offer to hop in my Audi they opt out of whatever you slopping in
I’m taking over again, the mission is mine
Imma get it back operative
So if you running low on your dough
Then it’s best that you know where the fuck that top ramen is
Synonyms, homonyms, whatever I gotta do to get a nigga back on
Dividends coming in, said it’s too hot for you, so nigga take it back home
I got this, I need you to understand one thing, that you not this
How you think I got rich, sit back nigga, watch this

[Hook]
I'ma be like (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
I'ma be like (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
I'ma be like (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
I'ma be like (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
