[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Welcome to epicness, I’m so dope and it’s effortless
Yeah I’m tryna brag and boast
If you looking for the shit nigga step in this
Disa my ting, hoes in back room kissing my ring
Ready for the day, hit me with the Visine
Getting to the money, counting up the ice cream
Me a baller boy, she with me, you better not call her boy
I'mma pass her round to all my boys
Cause she want the nuts like Almond Joy
Yeah, price tag don’t matter
If it ain’t about money then it’s just chit chatter
Bank account steady climbing up the ladder
You can literally see all of my pockets getting fatter
But I’m over your head
Southern folk prolly getting swole in the head
But your girlfriend calling, wait
Something just broke in the bed
Nappy boy, win squad, nigga that’s my team
Balling, stunting, drinking, smoking, nigga
Disa my ting!

[Hook: KK Holliday]

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Pimping since been pimp ass nigga
Whipping expensive whips ass nigga
They be tryna hold me but they know I got a Rolex that’ll make your fucking wrist go limp my nigga
You a zip my nigga, I bet your pocket full of lint my nigga
Errybody knows that I put it on these hoes
Got it sounding like a motherfucking chimp, my nigga
Welcome to the jungle dog, Balenciaga by the bundles dog
My bitch got to put a helmet on
My wide receiver don’t fumble balls
I’m rich as fuck and y’all like that shit
Smoke good nigga, light that spliff
Throwing money in the club, make it right back bitch
And I’m drinking like I don’t know what a nightcap is
Cause I ball too much, money too heavy and I’m [?] crutch
Get a quarter pound of the kush, fuck around later on put it all in the dutch
Nappy boy, win squad, nigga that’s my team
Balling, stunting, drinking, smoking, nigga

[Verse 3: Kardinal Offishall]
Yo fuck boy disa my ting
When the girl dem see me
Dem say this is my king
Ay boy mi no really care
If you no like him
T Pain  ah mi  dog, big up the Vikings
Physics couldn’t see me when I’m on a mission
No sidekick, just a nigga with a trigger and a cool head
Pause for the cause, I’m a boss for the boss
I’m an OG with a G tucked in my drawers
I’m ahead of my time, with an animal rhyme
Like [?] when it’s Busta Rhymes
Got to finesse all my lines, got to impress all the dimes
When they see me right away they know disa my ting
I don’t play no games, yo this is my ring
Champion team, autograph the jersey
Melt them bars like Hershey
Lot of mercy, purse me, just don’t push me
Don’t make me lift up your skirt, expose your nature
I don’t rate ya, to me your garbage
Couple bodyguards, don’t make it the hardest
Artist, no sir, just a punk in a fur
I’m a hunk, and I don’t smoke skunk, just murder
The bass been in your trunk, clip your wing
If a pussy wanna test [?], disa my ting

[Hook: KK Holliday]
Disa my sound an ah me have di crown
'Cause disa my ting
An ah me start the style, an ah me drive dem wild
'Cause disa my ting
If you waah make ah money then yuh affi work fah mi
'Cause disa my ting
Dem all want fi stop me, but dem ah just copy
Cause disa my ting
