[Intro: T-Pain]
Heyyy, it's 2-for-1 tonight, ohhhh
Fellas grab a lady, ladies get that money
From the V.I.P. to the main stage
Oh-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoahhhhh
Yeahh-YAY~!

[T-Pain]
I never seen a shorty dooo that (that)
On a pole (on a pole)
Reach in my pocket pull out two stacks
Then I throw (throwwww)
If you've ever done thism don't you feel dumb when
Shorty come over to you and start gettin it on
Then the song is almost done (that's so wrong)
So I made a long (long) lap dance song

[Hook]
I need a 2-for-1 or somethin
Otherwise I need my own, lap dance song
I've only been in here for two hours
And all my dollar bills is gone, for a lap dance song
I need more than a minute wit'chu
Before I spend a minute with you, girl c'mon
Don't do me wrong, you know what's goin on
Yeaah! This is the long, lap dance song

[Interlude: T-Pain]
Ohhh yayyy~! it's 2-for-1 tonight! Yeah

[T-Pain]
Shawty came out from the main stage (stage)
To the floor (floor)
Then we went into the V.I.P. (P got it all)
Baby was so ready, hot and so heavy
She got on top of me and took off her thong
Then the song was over (that's so wrong)
So I made a lonnnng lap dance song

[Hook]

[Interlude: T-Pain]
