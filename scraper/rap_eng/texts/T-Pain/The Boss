[Chorus]
I got a fresh line up, fresh outfit
'Bout to have the parking lot on smash
Plus I got a Chevy with a 4-54 in the hood that bitch got 1-25 in the dash
(She like a gangsta cause)
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
Cause it's just another day in the life of a God damn boss

I don't make love baby we make magic
Come home with a thug, let's get shit crackin'
Always wear plastic baby cause shit happens
She leaves the backseat just to freak in the magnum
Hopped out the magnum hopped in the tray
Just to let the top back and thank God for the day
Who gives a fuck what a hater gotta say?
I made a couple million dollars last year dealin' weight
Still in the streets strapped with them thangs
She in love with a G so she tatted my name (Ross!)
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
Ten black maybacks back to back in a lane
I'm a make it rain then I'm a make it back
You are just a lame lil' homie that's a fact
Workin' with the police actin' like ya know me
Fresh outta jail already in ya hoe's sheets

[Chorus]
The boss, boss, boss, the boss

Shawty straight diggin' me and I ain't even rich
I know you niggas on the sideline like ain't that a bitch
I'm on my job and I ain't gettin' off
Cause it's just another day in the life of the goddamn boss

[Verse 2]
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
Got the biggest car Spanish broads no bra
Callin' otha lames for the walks in the park
I ain't come to play games I just wanna play my part
Tell ya girlfriend to come talk with my dawg
We straight G's and we came here to ball
Bottle after bottle and I'm sure you count em all
Then we off to the Chevy fire it up and takin' off
Baby slow it down cause you movin' to fast
Ya ass too fine to be movin' too fast
Back to the thuggin' now I'm sippin' sy-z-urp
All my niggas love it baby that's my w-is-ord
Stack for the jeans five bones for the sh-is-irt
I don't smoke 28? 800 for the?
I'm the biggest boss that you seen thus far
You can tell by the shon's that's standin' by the car

[Chorus]
Ay, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, yea, ay
Ay, uh huh, yea, uh huh, yea, yea, yea
I'm the biggest boss that ya seen thus far
