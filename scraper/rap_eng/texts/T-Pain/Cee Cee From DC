Her name was Cee Cee from DC
She knows how to go-go dance

Throwing that thing on me
And every night in the club I'ma be
Steady looking at that ass in the club

[Verse 2: Wale]
My side my side
She made me my man so much I made her my wife
Nothing is more sexy than with woman with 9 to 5
I kiss below the naval and baby temperatures rise
See us, we up, undefeated
They never could beat us
Because I'm kicking it Fifa

To he or she who don't believe
You should go to DC
Far as the city goes, a couple crabs left
But most surely know
The courtside seater
Fill up many billy boards
Multi-Millionare
But when I'm there they call me billy goal
Ya
Used to be on that scene
I used to rap with [?] UCB
I'm married to Juwanna unibomb your ho and leave
That's what we really call a bounce b
