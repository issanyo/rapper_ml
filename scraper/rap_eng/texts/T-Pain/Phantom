Hahhh, yeahhhh
I've been in the treehouse for seven hours lookin at yo' house girl
Ever since you kicked me out girl - that ain't me!
Huh, but who the fuck is he?! (yeahhhhh)
I've been watchin y'all kissin and huggin, lickin yo' belly button
Touchin and rubbin but this nigga look just like me!
He got dreads and gold teeth! (yeahhhhh)
Now I know we just broke up, week and a half ago
How was I to remember the anniversary! (yeahhhh)
Baby I'm sorry! (yeahhhhh)
