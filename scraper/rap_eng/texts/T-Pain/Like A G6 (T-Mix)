[Hook]
Poppin' bottles in the ice, like a blizzard
When we drink we do it right gettin' slizzard
Sippin' sizzurp in my ride, like Three 6
Now you bitches are in tune to the T-Mix
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6
Like a G6, Like a G6
Now I'm feelin' so fly like a G6

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I'm high as a bird
If you say you saw me and I wasn't fly that's absurd
A thousand on the jeans and a solid five on the shirt
You see me, you need me in the game
I already know they gon' hate
But that's when I drop that (808)
Come on I ain't playin' with them
I make hits, I'm gone, I ain't stayin' with 'em
A G6 I'm on when I land in it
Ya get shit, ya don't understand nigga
Somebody come give me a high five
Something to keep my eyes wide
No it ain't no stoppin' we get pop pop poppin'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: The Cataracs]
Sippin' on, sippin' on sizz, I'ma ma-make it fizz
Girl I keep it gangsta, poppin' bottles at the crib
This is how we live, every single night
Take that bottle to the head, and let me see you fly

(808) Hell Yeaa
Drink it up, drink-drink it up
When sober girls around me, they be actin' like they drunk
They be actin' like they drunk, actin'-actin' like they drunk
When sober girls around me actin'-actin' like they drunk

[Hook]

[Bridge: The Cataracs]
Its that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up
(You can't Touch this)
Its that 808 bump, make you put yo hands up
Make you put yo hands up, put yo, put yo hands up
(You can't Touch this)
Hell Yeaaa, Make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up
Hell Yeaaa, Make you put yo hands up, put yo put yo hands up

[Hook]
