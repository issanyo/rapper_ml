[Intro: T-Pain]
Okay
Oooh-oo-oo-oo-oooh
Yeah...
Yeah, yeah...
Oooh-oo-oo-oo-oooh
Yeah....

[T-Pain]
Baby (sit down)
I got something that I need to say (right now)
Before the rumors spread and make their way (around town)
I thought I'd be a man and tell you first
But I know it's going to hurt
Baby please let me explain (let me explain)
It happened all the sudden out of control (ohhhh)
She had my heart and would not let it go (go-ohhhh)
I'm not tryin to say that it was okay
Or that I didn't do it

[Hook]
But I gotta tell the truth (the whole truth)
With my right hand up
(Cause I don't wanna lose you) It's time to man up
(I just gotta be the one to tell you)
Baby believe me when I say
You don't wanna find out the hard way

[T-Pain]
Baby (if I) would've never seen her walkin down the block
I probably would have not, pulled over and asked her
If she needed (a ride)
But I noticed she had makeup on her eyes
Then she started to cry
I said baby, please explain (please explain)
She said her man put his hands on her
He was outta control (outta control)
And she really needed someone to hold and not let go
And then she looked into my eyes just like you do
Then I imagined she was you

[Hook]

[T-Pain]
Baby now I wish that I, was a magician and I
Could make all of this disappear
And baby I wish that I, could go back in time
And trust me baby, we wouldn't be here (we just wouldn't be here)
But you've been so good to me, how could I do this to you?
And I never meant to hurt you, how can I prove it to you?
I'm just tryin to say what's been on my mind
Cause it hurts you

[Hook]
