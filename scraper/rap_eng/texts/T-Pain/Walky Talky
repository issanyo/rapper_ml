[Verse 1]
Uh, break the breaker, win it
Can you hear me loud and clear?
He's got your heart but you want mine
You need to be over here
The further you get away, every word that I had to say
Seems like you want to disappear
And I heard that you leaving, I can't believe it
It's officially turned into a search and rescue
Wherever you are, whatever I gotta do to get you
My heart is beating so hard
You can hear it go boom boom boom boom boom boom
Boom boom boom boom boom boom

[Chorus]
Girl stop it, you break me up like a walkie talkie
Hello, hello, where did you go?
Yeah, you break me up like a walkie talkie
Come in, come in, where you been?
Yeah, you break me up like a walkie talkie
Break up, break up, one liner
I been tryna find her like
Yeah, you break me up like a walkie talkie
Hello, hello, where did you go?
Yeah, you break me up like a walkie talkie
