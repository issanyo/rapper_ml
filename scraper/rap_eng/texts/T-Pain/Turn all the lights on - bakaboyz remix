Turn all the lights on
Take off your shoes shoes shoes
Ain’t nobody gon’ see nothin
Bring out the booze booze booze
Baby girl stop frontin’
Ain’t nothin’ to lose lose lose
And I ain’t gotta work no more
Fuck that blazer, Fuck my boss

So I’m going hard

Gimme that glass
Little bit of ice
Pour that rain in there

Dancing like ain’t nobody else in here
Sexy as she wanna be and she
Dancing next so close to me
I said please excuse
You steppin’ on expensive shoes
Shawty is a perfect ten
This angelic body made you sin
I love the way you get it in
Come over here and shake it for a gentleman
Cause you want it
She’s going hard

Oh yeah I’m going in
And now I’m with my friends
