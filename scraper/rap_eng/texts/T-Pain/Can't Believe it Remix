[Intro: T-Pain]
I feel so good
Do u know why? This is the remix
T-Pain, Justin Timberlake
Y'all don't understand
She make the people say, yeah yeah
Let's go

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I can put you in a log cabin, somewhere in Aspen
Girl ain't nothing to the Pain
Ain't trickin' if u got it what u askin', for
Put u in the mansion, somewhere in Wisconsin
Like I said ain't nothin to the Pain
We can change the last name, what's happenin'?
Cause you look so good, tell me why you wanna work here
I'll put on the front page of a King magazine
But u gon get yourself hurt here, hey
Baby I brought you in the back just to have a conversation
Really think you need some ventilation
Let's talk about you, and me

[Chorus x2: T-Pain]
Ooh I can’t believe it
Ooh ooh she all on me, on me
Man, man I think she want me, want me
Now I can’t leave her lonely, naw

[Bridge: T-Pain]
And you don’t understand she make the people say yeah
Yeah, yeah
She hit the main stage, she make the people say yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake]
(Picture this) I can see you breathless
Standing out across the bay of Massachusetts
And when I ask you for the time
Your eyes adjust to the way I shined your wrist, frio
Or I can see ya smiling, standing on your own island
Girl it ain't nothing to our man
To give u all the things in life that u miss, priceless
You so good, you make me wanna spend it all on ya
Scoot up out of this club
Slide with ya boy and we can do what you wanna, yeah
Baby I brought you in the back cause you need a little persuasion
Plus you need a little ventilation
Lets talk about you, and me

[Chorus 2: Justin Timberlake]
Ohh u can’t believe it
Ooh ooh I'm all on ya, on ya
That’s that’s because I want ya, want ya
Now now, don’t leave me lonely, girl
Cause you can’t believe it
Ooh ooh I'm all on ya, on ya
That’s, that’s because I want ya, want ya
Now now, don’t leave me lonely, girl

[Bridge: T-Pain & Justin Timberlake]
And you don’t understand she make the people say yeah
Yeah, yeah
She hit the main stage, she make the people say yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
Now I could put you in a town house
I could put you in my house
Yeah, knew she was a ringer
Had to ice up her finger and make her my spouse
I'm talking bout Timberlake here, you know
We’ll have the wedding in Jamaica
But for now, put your frame upon my frame
And if ya want to say my name
Ya know I'll make ya, say it
Cause u do it so good you make me wanna do it all over
Cuz baby your love is built like a drug
And I don’t wanna be sober, naw
Now I brought you in the back cause u need a little persuasion
Plus you need a little ventilation
I'm talking bout you, with me

[Chorus 2: Justin Timberlake]

[Bridge x2: T-Pain & Justin Timberlake]
