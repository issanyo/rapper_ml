[Intro: T-Pain]

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I keep seeing niggas tryin' to be my duplicates
Running round acting like they be the poop and shit
Like they made a new groove and shit
I'm the leader of the new school and baby I got proof of it
I pop my collar girl got these rapper niggas singing like we are the world
Holler girl they calling me a switcher
Or is it the switches on this Impala girl
I talk shit cause I can
Smoking on that green we goin' green eggs and ham
Adada mean adada say I'm superclean get out my face
I had to go get F.A.B. again and
Tha Bizness on this motherfucker slap again
Nappy boy bitch you know the team
If you ain't get the picture yet check your photo stream

[Hook: Krizz Kaliko]
This right here on the trump nigga that shit bump
Nigga that shit bump, nigga that shit blank
Nigga that shit slap, nigga that shit blap
So I'mma call it blapper, blapper
Blapper, blapper, blapper, blapper
Blapper, blapper, blapper, blapper
Blapper, this is a blapper

[Verse 2: Mr. F.A.B.]
T.U.K. tu-tu-turn up king
You niggas turn down like turnips
Get your girl wetter than a scuba if she smell like tuna
She get kicked out the ride no fifa
So much T.R.U. religion I'm Buddha, got hoes like Luda
I will never ever miss a Monifa
Turn the music up I'mma pop a speaker
She hit me on Twitter cause she know that I'm a tweaker
What you doing brah? shit I'm 'bout to murder this feature
Pain put me in the game no bleachers, see ya
See my style and wanna snatch it, fires
Later wanna call hifi ratchet (Stop it)
That's just LOL I know you don't hear me on the radio well
I don't give a F
I'm going to the right and you goin' to the left turn it!

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Krizz Kaliko]
Kali to the ba-uh-bay, ba-uh-ba-uh-baby
Shout out to the ba-uh-business, rockin the pavement
I can get belligerent, ignorant, Christopher crazy
Deliver it hot, like it's fresh up out of the bakery
A hell of a nigga, you ain't seen me on television and
Everyone listenin', me and Nina be in your system
I still go Stewey-ooey, making your girlfriend get real gooey-ooey
816 boyz Missouri-ouri
This shit slaps like a bad kid
Tecca Nina but Teddy Pain look what F.A.B. did
I finger it like it's the sphincter of a bad bitch
This beat is so thick look like it already done had kids
So put this in your speaker box
Call it an old school prank, cause this nigga knocks
We reppin' from the bay to the A to the K to the C
It's a blapper with a capital B

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Tech N9ne]
I-dada mean, Molly is my medicine
My mind, my dream, have her looking elegant
My highlight is goin' fly by my wi-dife
And hoin' my life is triumph for no one but that's irrelevant
I'm tryin' to party, bitch I ain't the president
I don't swat flies, cause bitch I am an elephant
I'm in the party like dada-dada
Drinking with Nory you know we got nadda fama
But I peace for sex and, she's my best friend
If she sleeps with Tech then keep a heap of cheques in
My pad your lady give me money ain't my bad
Your problem, cause you wifed a bitch in the ho column
And I'm happy the morning after, smashed her
Beat it up hella quick like I was Master IP
Dip to my crib and I stash a grip
Banging this beat I love it cause this a blapper bitch
