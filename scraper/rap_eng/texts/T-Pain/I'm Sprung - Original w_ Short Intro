She got me doin da dishes
Anythang she want for some kisses
I'm cookin for her when she gets hungry
All she do is actin like she want me
She cuttin off all my homies
Even all my other ronnies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinking 'bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her...
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me...
And I'm takin everythang with me...
Well it all come down to her...

I'm Sprung...(I'm sprung)
Dawg She Got Me...
Got me doin things I'll never do If u ain't been I'm tellin you
I'm Sprung...(I'm Sprung)
Dawg She Got Me...
Got me doin things I'll never do If u ain't been I'm tellin you

So we went our separate ways...
It's been a couple of days...
But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody tellin me what I'm gone do
And I'm feeling so free...
With nobody but me...
Now I can handle all my business
All my fellas can I get a witness
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her...
Now I'm leavin quickly...
Before she come and try to get me...
And I'm takin everythang with me...
Well it all come down to her...

I'm Sprung...(I'm sprung)
Dawg She Got Me...
Got me doin things I'll never do If u ain't been I'm tellin you
I'm Sprung...(I'm Sprung)
Dawg She Got Me...
Got me doin things I'll never do If u ain't been I'm tellin you
