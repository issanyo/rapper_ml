[Intro]
Uh huh, Riu you a fool for this one, dawg
Uh huh, okay
It's all about good living, baby
That's all it is, I got it
Nappy Boy!

[Verse 1]
Come here shawty
Let me show you what a real nigga look like
Let me show you what a real nigga look like
1, 2 step, Teddy bells on foot right
Holla at me 'fore you tell a nigga goodnight
I know you from the country
Show me what you cook like
Come to the crib, I got a person to cook light
And I know a lot of niggas say the same thing
But that's 'cause they trynna be just like me
But I'm icy, I never been dull
Unless I'm in the courtroom in front of the judge
And that ain't never gon' happen, we can get it cracking
You ain't never gotta worry about me skipping off
Baby if you with it, we can go 'n kick it off
'Cause you ain't gotta really worry about nothing at all
So tell me if you with it
Know that I ain't never bullshitting
Go ahead and give a nigga the business
I got to go

[Hook]
Girl I go to go
If you not busy baby
Come with me flying on my airplane
Ain't gotta say no more
Unless we sitting high on 26's
Girl, that 'bout the same thing
Ooh, girl i got to go
You cooking with gas now
Let me see that ass bounce girl
You ain't gotta say no more
Go around the world with the best of them
Not worried about the rest of them, girl
I ain't gotta say no more

[Verse 2]
Come here bitch let me show you what a foul mouth nigga is
Let me show you what a down south nigga is
Grits and eggs, tits and legs, thick as bread
I ain't know how you was but I figured it
Was gon' be like this - or like this
Tattoos from your ankle to your white wrist
Drop a top so far in a white whip
Dark chocolate bar, you can bite this
See, life is a movie
Keep running from your feeling, you'll eventually fall like a white bitch
And I know you wanna do me
I ain't trynna be nasty
I'm way too fly, where's my kite, bitch
My bad, I ain't trynna be cussing
No disrespect, that's just how I does it
Blue Bentley, rims with the buttons
Lets go get some food or something

[Hook]
Girl I go to go
If you not busy baby
Come with me flying on my airplane
Ain't gotta say no more
Unless we sitting high on 26's
Girl, that 'bout the same thing
Ooh, girl i got to go
You cooking with gas now
Let me see that ass bounce girl
You ain't gotta say no more
Go around the world with the best of them
Not worried about the rest of them, girl
I ain't gotta say no more
