[Intro: T-Pain]
You don't even know right now
I'm staring at my phone right now
Wondering if I should call you or leave you 'lone right now
I'm in my zone right now
I'm just, chilling at home right now
Shots of Patrón right now
I should put my phone right down
But girl, I'm so alone right now
That's why I'm

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex (yeah)
Ooh, that's why I'm textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex
And I'm so ready for regrets
Yeah, baby, baby
I know you remember way, way back in December we was in love, yeah
I've been thinking of you
Please tell me that I'm the one you're thinking of, yeah
I just can't forget you now since I met you down in the club, ye-yeah
I know that I let you down, but we need to just link back up, yeah

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Probably shouldn't call you
But you know I'm 'bout to call you
And I don't even need to fall through
But I'm a man, baby, ain't that what we all do?
I understand what you tweetin' out
Hoping I'm the man that you speaking 'bout
But you didn't @ me
Hope my new girl don't catch me

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex (yeah)
Ooh, that's why I'm textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex
And I'm so ready for regrets
Yeah, baby, baby
I know you remember way, way back in December we was in love, yeah
I've been thinking of you
Please tell me that I'm the one you're thinking of, yeah
I just can't forget you now since I met you down in the club, ye-yeah
I know that I let you down, but we need to just link back up, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2: Tiffany Evans]
You know you shouldn't call me
So why the hell you call me?
You know I got a new man
But this unknown number, this is all you
Even though this ain’t right
I’ll give it to you, I won’t think twice
Didn't mean to hurt you
Just hope your new girl don't catch you texting your ex

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex (yeah)
Ooh, that's why I'm textin' my ex (oh no)
Don't nothing look good
I'm just talkin' 'bout sex
I'm so ready for regrets
Yeah, baby, baby
I know you remember way, way back in December we was in love, yeah
I've been thinking of you
Please, tell me that I'm the one you're thinking of, yeah
I just can't forget you now since I met you down in the club, yeah
I know that I let you down, but we need to just link back up, yeah
