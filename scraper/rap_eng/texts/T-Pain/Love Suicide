[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I gotta talk to my lady
I don’t know why, but lately
Seem like she don’t love me no more, love me no more
She flipped the script on me, one-eighty
Oh, now  baby, why you acting like that for? Like that for?
She got me thinking about it
And I’m tryna figure out what did I do?
Or is she cheating on me and she’s falling in love with du'?

[Bridge: T-Pain]
But she talk to me in a week, and I’m losing my mind
But if she don’t care about commitment

[Hook: T-Pain]
She won’t mind if I commit love suicide
If I commit love suicide
She won’t mind if I commit love suicide
If I commit love suicide
She won’t mind

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
We need to talk, really really
Kill this relationship quickly
This ain’t gonna work no more, work no more
Go 'head and walk, get the hell out
Me and you, we done fell out
I don’t wanna hurt no more, hurt no more
She got me thinking about it
And I’m tryna figure out where I went wrong
Cause all she do is party, party, party
In the club rockin’ all night long

[Hook x2: T-Pain]

[Verse 3: Severe]
I be going insane, shawty jump around like she House of Pain
Type to have you thinking about blowing out your brains
Gettin' the gas, lightin' the matches, then your whole house in flames
Yeah, I’m tripping I suppose
Knowing I ain’t supposed to be tripping on these hoes
Knowing I could have any bitches doing shows
If I scream “Who is that?” watch the bitches hit the floor
They say that I’m the dude
The girls think I’m trippin’, they say that I’m a fool
Missing all the fun, stressin’ over you
Got me so disgusted, I don’t know what to do
Now I’m on the edge, feeling terrible inside
The way I feel is too unbearable to hide
Got me jumping off the cliff, middle finger to the sky
Screaming “Fuck you and I”

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Outro: T-Pain]
She won’t mind if I commit love suicide
