Yeah uh
Nappy boy

Ahh man
(Sigh)
Aye, i know u think its gonna take 4 niggas star to respect
The blood and the tears and the sweat
And still don't ferget where the so called ideas came from
Or who they call for ideas when they ain't none

Who carry them on there shoulders when they can't run
Its hard work when u find out it ain't fun
But hard work will turn a man into a bitch
But hard work ain't shit compared to hard dicks, So

Ain't nobody fuck with me, im unfuckwitable
Record labels hit the ground when i hit the doe
They say we need a first single for Mr. so and so
And Mrs. bitch over here don't even know where to go

Since everybody need directions
I put out the mix tape so listen to my lecture
I bet cha
I tell you that the game is just a game its not hard

Up down, Up down, A.b. star
You go R-e-s-p-e-c-t T me T p Tallahassee Florida
And if somebody don't got me what i need and i need to see everything else in order
In order for me to see me being what i need to be then somebody else gone be much less

Dig that
Until then imma spit the real end of it
Otherwise fuck it
Dig that

Yeah, these swat niggas wanna make me be outtie
So i bought me a outtie
Cuz when i get the rest, i go and get a whip
And the only challenger i got is still at the Dodge dealership, damn

You nigga's ain't feeling me yet
He in here for crazy ass for that T-pain affect
And T-pain and shit
To step on a nigga toes

But my nigga's been known to fuck with 'A' nigga holes
Can't stand the heat then get the fuck up the restraunt
I make the niggas feel low
Somebody get the blunt

Somebbody get this kinda Tapon quick
I'm throwin tricks at these tricks
Im on my 'And 1' shit
Tallahassee Gold Trauter

Ready like rambo
Get the fast cash a hard lass in the lambo
Its nothing but a game its not hard
Up down, up down, A.B. star

You go R-e-s-p-e-c-t T-Me T-P Tallahassee Florida
And if somebody dont got me what i need and i need to see everything else in order
In order for me to see me being what i need to be then somebody else gone be much less
Dig that

Until then imma spit the real end of it
Otherwise fuck it
Dig that
