(Feat. T-Pain)

[Intro - T-Pain]
Mmmmmmmm
Let me talk to 'em
Let me talk to 'em
(Let it rain)
Mmmmmmmm
Let me talk to 'em
C'mon!

[Chorus (T-Pain):]
Shawty had apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey! )
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Flo-Rida]
Hey, I ain't never seen nothing that'll make me go
This crazy all night spending my doe
Had the million dollar vibe and a body to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual
She was flexible,
Professional,
Drinking X&O
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I whoa
Did I think I seen shawty get low
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm making it snow
Work the pole I gotta bank role
I'ma say that I prefer her no clothes
I'm in to that I love women exposed
She threw it back at me I gave her mo'
Cash ain't a problem I know where it go (she had them)

[Chorus (T-Pain)]
She had them Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey! )
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Flo-Rida]
Hey, shawty what I gotta do to get you home
My jeans filled with gwap and they're ready for showing
Cadillacs laid back for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack (come on), two stacks (come on), three stacks (come on)
Now that's three grand
What you think I'm playing baby girl I'm the man
I'll bend the rubber bands
That's when I threw her legs on my shoulders
I knew it was over
That heny and Cola got me like a soldier
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her
So lucky, oh me, I was just like clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster
She showed her

[Chorus (T-Pain)]
Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey! )
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low

[Flo-Rida]
Whoa, shawty yeah she was worth the money
Little mama took my cash
And I ain't want it back
The way she bent that back
Got all them paper stacks
Tattoo above her crack
I had to handle that
I was on it sexy woman
Let me show it make me want it
Two in the morning, I'm zonin
N Them Rosa bottles foaming
She wouldn't stop
Made it drop
Shawty did that pop and lock
Had to break her off that gwap
Yeah that was fly just like my glock

[Chorus (T-Pain)]
Apple bottom jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was looking at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reebok's with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (hey! )
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low, low
(C'mon! )
