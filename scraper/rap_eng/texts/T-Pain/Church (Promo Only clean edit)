Ladies & Gentlemen
You already know what it is
Okay, Yeah, Aw shit
I'm cuttin' a rug in this muthafucker
I'm tryin' to anyways
Got 2 hard lookin' muthafuckers
Come on

I was tryin' to enjoy my night, but you done came in
Turned around the vibe I had before I came in
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you had to fuck-up the night, now we got to fight, I'm a knock out ya lights

You ain't doin' nuthin' but runnin' ya yap-yap
You got to go get a couple homeboys, I am strap-strapped
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you had to fuck-up the night, now we got to fight, I'm a knock out ya lights

Dope little lady tryin' to hold you back, you better listen to her
She better not talk that shit, Imma have to put some fist right through her
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you had to fuck-up the night, now we got to fight, I'm a knock out ya lights... Come on!

[Chorus:]
Yeah, goddamn! You think you cool, you think I'm not, you think you tough?
Goddamn! You think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough?
Goddamn! You talkin' shit, better close your lips, you need to hush -
Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to Church!
[x2]

It's a Sunday at the park, I'm chillin' tryin' to get my flirt on
Some little lane tryin' to run that game, tryin' to get his serve on
I done turned into a rude dude
Why you gotta fuck-up the park, I'm a put you in the dark, clap on, clap off

You ain't doin' nuthin' but runnin' your pie-hole
You gon' make me do somethin' that'll get your eye swoll
I don't wanna be a rude dude, man
Why you gotta fuck-up the park, I'm a put you in the dark, clap on, clap off

If that's your car, you need to go ahead and get into it!
Better not talk that shit you gonna get bust something through it
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you gotta fuck up the park, gotta put you in the dark, lights on, lights off

[Chorus:]
Yeah, goddamn! You think you cool, you think I'm not, you think you tough?
Goddamn! You think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough?
Goddamn! You talkin' shit, better close your lips, you need to hush -
Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to Church!
