[Intro: T-Pain]
Ladies and gentlemen, you are now in tune to a Nappy Boy Revolution
We love you baby
We ain't going nowhere
We can't stop, we won't stop
Take off! Nappy Boy!

[Hook x2: T-Pain]
The champ is here, the champ is here
Middle fingers up, get amp in here
I'm back bitch, I'm a G
Hail Mary, follow me

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Ring, ring to your dome, bitch, I'm coming with a two-piece
I'm ambidextrious, playing with 2 coochies
I love it, yes, I love it, I do it like it's nothing
I be bussin' I be bussin', like Jackie Chan stuntin'
All the lame hoes get out, bad bitches hands up
Tear up the club, we gon' leave this bitch in handcuffs
Stand up to all the real niggas
No matter what we do, we-we still niggas
So wanna ball out, and getcho fuck on
Go all out, take that slut home
We goin' in, we goin' off
She on her knees, I turn and cough
Champagne on the whole crowd
Screaming "NappyBoy!"- it's on now
I'm on that Nuvo, she on that Henn
Forgive me father, for I am about to sin

[Hook x2: T-Pain]
The champ is here, the champ is here
Middle fingers up, get amp in here
I'm back bitch, I'm a G
Hail Mary, follow me

[Verse 2: Tay Dizm]
Riding round in my Chevy, blowing on that fire
Bitch, I don't play games, what the fuck you think I'm 'bout
I be chillin' with my niggas, we all on that bud ice
Fuck around if you want to, get hit in the head with that bud ice
No, I ain't no pussy, all day I be dinnin'
I don't play no games, all day I be winnin'
I stay beamed up, set high, old school is what I'm whipping
Had a 12 pack, got 11 more ridin' round and I'm sipping one
Got your bitch up in my [?] some of y'all niggas be slipping
She calling me the captain 'cause my dick is just ridiculous
They mad at me, my money getting thicker
Y'all niggas stay broke, NappyBoy get richer
Dizm this, Dizm that, all I hear is Dizm now
What's up? Big talk? Nigga, you know what I'm 'bout
Nothing but the truth, what I got the life on
Right hand up in the air, left hand up on the Bible
So, now you know

[Hook x2: T-Pain]
The champ is here, the champ is here
Middle fingers up, get amp in here
I'm back bitch, I'm a G
Hail Mary, follow me
