You ain't gotta watch your kids
You can go and get your nails did
I'll save ya (uh uh)
I'll save ya
And I can open up these doors
You can put on your clothes
And watch your behavior

Because I'm here to save you girl
Now go and find you a rich white man
And maybe he can pay you
It might be minimum wage but
It's okay cause you're a new girl
And ain't nobody go be on the mic
Calling Cinnamon to the stage girl
I can't wait girl

Because I'm gonna save you
You ain't gotta worry about smelly fat dudes tryin' to lay you
Let's start with a brand new job
And see where that takes you
From this moment on baby you're my girl
And this those goes out to all the struggling strippers in the world
World, In the world
This goes out to all wanna be strippers in the world
In the world, world
