[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Maybach music
Maybach music II remix
Let me warn you now
Maybach music III
Teflon Don, coming soon
We the best!

[Hook: T-Pain]
Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homey I'mma make back
Can you believe it? (Ooooh)
You gotta see it (Yay)
Cause I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music

[Verse 1: Jay Z]
Smell like summertime to me
First one to cop I'm the Maybach muse
First one in the coup I'm on my third six deuce
White guts, black Benz
I call that bitch affirmative action
Oreo, the Obama
Curtains drawn they can't see me Osama
Cashmere throws that's a splash of class
SC initials on the Tiffany glass
I guess only initial Maybach
I was way too official they ain't call Jay back
I'm just a bully I apologize
And if you were to ask I probably would've lied
This feather, no pressure
As my mind reclines on white leathers
I think back to my first Maybach
Baby blue sides I call her my Similac
Six deuce every time, I never had the Heinz
Fifty seven can' catch up to mines
No diss to Ricky this his song
But everybody know this the shit that I've been on
No pops, no four point o's
So no partitions a no no for HOV
I'm just a top drawn
Pent house every time I'm a top floor nigga
As I drift off further
Chauffeur serves the city's observers
Oohs and aahs they know who's inside
Though I never touch the wheel I won't lose my drive
Oohs and aahs they know who's inside
On the path that we choose I won't lose my stride

[Hook: T-Pain]
Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homey I'mma make back
Can you believe it? (Ooooh)
You gotta see it (Yay)
Cause I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Talk about, something that's supersedes greatest
Undisputed hands down been one of the best you get it
Future Maybach prototypes worldwide web balling it
Hotel sized cribs imported marvel every floor
Butlerettes in every room, maids in every corridor
Distance to the other side of the crib is so long
It reminds me of a city block walk to the corner store
Unimaginable raw
Conveyor belts built in the ground to move around fuck a nigga walking for
No longer cut the coke I know the people want the pure
I can read what nigga think fuck you even talking for
Unimaginable wealth
Its raining paper, playing golf with politicians and my dignitary neighbors
You smell that money on me, get to inhaling the vapors
[?] proof in a situation could phase us
Its obvious I'm back to lyrical saviors

[Hook: T-Pain]
Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homey I'mma make back
Can you believe it? (Ooooh)
You gotta see it (Yay)
Cause I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
Kush burn like petroleum, crib needs custodians
Shades in all shades, these made of rhodium
Used to be the Oldsmo, hoes call it oh lo
Now I got so many horses bitches call me Polo
57, 62, tell me how you wanna move
Yea you know I got them both, beat your ass black and blue
I was barely getting pretty women
Now I scoop Emmy winners like kitty litter
Any winter Fendi denim like a slender nigga
Looking in the mirror I can see the real contender
Celery for Eben Gregory I'm on my dinner
So what the fuck is ya telling me other than your gender
I'm a boss and I'm riding like a small vault
Niggas make your wheels and ride 'til they fall off
Yea, Ross

[Hook: T-Pain]
Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out, homey I'mma make back
Can you believe it? (Ooooh)
You gotta see it (Yay)
Cause I don't plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
Cause I'm in it to win now, niggas can't take that
Listen to my Maybach music, to my Maybach music
