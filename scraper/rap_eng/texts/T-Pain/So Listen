[Verse 1]
I've been trying to find the right words
But they always seem to hit the page wro-o-u-wrong
You see I tend to fight words
You breathe them into life, and they're gone
I need some louder speaking actions
They do what letters could never do-o-o-o
You see, you are my addiction
I need more than words to show you

[Chorus]
So listen
To-to-to-to me, so listen
Li-li-li-listen to my heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I'd like to think you understand me
But I never really like to assume
So you never have to ask me
I'm a let my actions tell you the tru-hu-huth
For you-hu-hu-hu
There is nothing I wouldn't go through-hu-hu-hu
And if you need some proo-oo-oo-oof
You can find it in what I do-oo-oo-oo
Listen to me baby
And I could tell you everyday
Just how much I want you
I-I-I-I I've never been good with words
But I went and wrote this song for you

[Chorus]
So listen, to-to-to-to me, so listen
Listen to my heartbeat
So listen, (Hey) to-to-to-to me (to me), so listen (Yeah, yeah)
Listen to my heartbeat

[Verse 3]
Ba-ba-baby I need you to listen, (listen) open up your ears (open up your ears)
Pay attention, (tention) let go of your fears
I'm not trying to be that dude that got these people in your business (business)
I'm just trying to love you, (love you) can I get a witness? oohhh
Le le le le le let the church say amen! (amen)
Cause I know that you need a man! (a man)
And I'm going to do whatever I can
So stop with all the dissing
Get to the kissing
Baby you know what you missing!

[Chorus]
So listen to-to-to-to me, (to me ohh) so listen
Listen to my heartbeat (le-le-le-listen to my heartbeat)
So listen (listen) to-to-to-to me, (to me) so listen (ooohh)
Listen to my heartbeat (listen to my heartbeat)
Listen to my heartbeat[x2]
