[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Man I got way to many cars to let the hatin' get to me
Especially when I know you ain't gone bring the shit to me
So on and so forth, I'm so on and so forceful
Young Fyre kick drums, leave a print of a horse shoe
Everywhere I go, my shit getting played cause
I ain't in the hood, I stay in the rave clubs
Keep using them big words that I don't understand
I take it as disrespect, then turn your face to a cave cuz
Now that's stupid from a couple aspects
But so is rollin' up weed with my publishing checks
You don't think Nappy Boy is the clique, or T-Pain is the shit
You must be snorting on some fucking anthrax
Now that's old school white shit
My tongue wearing skinny jeans, my flow on that tight shit
Love from a nigga is the only thing I might get
Everything else, I got; if not, I'll buy it, now try this

[Chorus; One Chance]
I surrounded by so much hate
Ain't gone let another take my place
I'm sick and tired of all these lies
Ya'll niggas ain't felt no pain
