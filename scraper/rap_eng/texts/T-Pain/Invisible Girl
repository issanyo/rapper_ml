[Verse 1]
You're hard to find even when your heart is mine
Give you my heart and mind as well
Invisible girl
You're hard to know but I can't let you go
You're so invisible to me
Invisible girl you are
Invisible girl you are to me
Invisible girl you are

[Hook]
I see right through your lies
Your so transparent and translucent
No wonder why you wanna be
Invisible girl
Look in your eyes I know you're used to always losing
No wonder why you wanna be
Invisible girl

[Verse 2]
You're hard to love and even harder to see
And so invisible to me
Invisible girl I love you
And I see you
I love you ,...to me
Invisible girl you are

[Hook]
I see right through your lies
Your so transparent and translucent
No wonder why you wanna be
Invisible girl
Look in your eyes I know you're used to always losing
No wonder why you wanna be
Invisible girl
