[Chorus: T-Pain]
You can gamble on me, if you play yo cards right
Shawdy you'll see, hand over your chips and lay 'em all me
Gamble on me, you can gamble on me-e-e-e-e-e-e-e
Gamble on me if you like your R's put it down for a G
Roll with a winner and shawdy you'll see (GUNZ)
Oh oh shawdy, they don't belone, you can gamble on me

[Verse 1: Cory Gunz]
Try ya luck, shawdy try ya luck
Pul-pul-pul-pul-pull that slot jackpot round 'em up
Round 'em up we hit that club, throw seven up and they hold on us
Like a pole on us, they be all on us, when the booze or the mose or the rose on us
Hit like it ain't no toes on us, you be playin o so much

One more call one more dime, one more call one more time
Walderback back-back-back-back-back
Walderback shawdy know my blackjack game fat as jack black

[Chorus: T-Pain]
You can gamble on me, if you play yo cards right

Gamble on me if you like your R's put it down for a G
Roll with a winner and shawdy you'll see
Oh oh shawdy, they don't belone, you can gamble on me

[Verse 3: Cory Gunz]
