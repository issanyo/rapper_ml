[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Got a motherfucking six shooter stuffed in my sweatpants
I ain't playin', I ain't scared of 'em
Tell them pussy niggas let's dance
Chopper make your body wobble
Make your head bobble up and down like a yes man
See I be tryna run to the money
Try to stop me and the situation gon' go left
Yeah, 'cause I feel like I'm Haitian
Man I got too many people sitting on the porch
Got some light-skinned bitches sitting by the torch
My niggas got that flare, screaming you your [?]
Different neighborhood
Crazy
The police don't even come 'round when we get it
My mama in the kitchen screaming fuck them other bitches
See me in the streets with that flag on my face

[Hook: T-Pain]
'Cause I feel like I'm Haitian
Yeah
Sak pase to the nation
When I hit Miami, bet you land in vacation
'Cause I feel like I'm Haitian
Pull up on me, nigga we gon' have problems
You ain't with the shits then you ain't from the bottom
'Cause I feel like I'm

[Verse 2: Zoey Dollaz]
18-O-4, that's my people
Shout out to them real zoes
They ain't in the kitchen cooking grillo
Probably out whipping up a kilo
Sak pase, n'ap boule
All my zoes get it up when I lay
I feel like I'm Haitian but I am though
Haitian nigga's strap bigger than Rambo
Lil Haiti, Haitians thank you for our boat ride
You either fuck with us or don't
Nigga we ain't going for the both sides
Ask 'em how them Haitian niggas do it
Zoe life or no life, yeah nigga, that's the movement
Come to Florida, enjoy your vacation
But make sure you down with some Haitians

[Hook: T-Pain]
Haitians
Yeah
Sak pase to the nation
When I hit Miami, bet you land in vacation
'Cause I feel like I'm Haitian
Pull up on me, nigga we gon' have problems
You ain't with the shits then you ain't from the bottom

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
I ain't gotta tell you that I run with the shooters
Nigga you gon' find out
Nigga this is my house
And i'll put a pussy nigga up on time-out
Put him in a box he can't climb out
Ain't no bobbin' and weavin', I send them [?] 'round
You can keep on taking dimes out
But this ugly bitch I'm with gon' pull that fire out
Like, die die diggity die now
You was talking that shit, you acting pie now
You just stepped over the line now
You better ask god for a sign now
You try to knock my hustle, knock your lights out
My niggas got the rifle with the sights out
Them Haitian niggas come and cross your life off
For that white girl, Amy Winehouse

[Hook: T-Pain]
'Cause I feel like I'm Haitian
Yeah
Sak pase to the nation
When I hit Miami, bet you land in vacation
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm Haitian
Pull up on me, nigga we gon' have problems
You ain't with the shits then you ain't from the bottom
'Cause I feel like I'm
