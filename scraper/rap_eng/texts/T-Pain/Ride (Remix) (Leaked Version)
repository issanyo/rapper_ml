[Intro - T-Pain]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
And when I, chase this paper
You ain't got to wait for me to bring it back home to you
Because I ride, or die, girl we going to be good

[Verse 1 - Ace Hood]
Baby just hold it down, I need a chick that'll ride for me
My gutter baby who ain't scared to put in time for me
See this the remix shawty I'ma keep the cash coming
Don't guess who played the track and fast to keep the cash running
You my official lady, no booing like McGrady, don't do nobody favours
Tell them fuck off and pay you, that's what I love about you
Don't watch no soap operas
You back that paper half naked, get that coke and product
Then bring them dollars back to papa, give you half a profit
You can go blow the money, that Louis bag of hundreds
Niggas be trying to holler, but she be hella fronting
She never met a nigga real as So it's all or nothing

[Chorus - T-Pain]
Even though I'm in the streets, you know exactly what I do
And when I, chase this paper
You ain't got to wait for me to bring it back home to you
Because I ride, or die, girl we going to be good
And if you ride, or die, we going to make it out this hood

[Verse 2 - Rick Ross]
She my Lamborghini, I'm her '57
When she hold me I close my eyes and just picture Heaven
She picture perfect, this a perfect picture
I'm stuffing thousand lines in each and every purse I get you
I kiss her in the mouth, she watch my money stack
She know I'm here forever, it's deeper than the rap
I have multiple shones, she one in a milli'
Now it's colorful stones, because there's ice in my Phillies

[Verse 3 - Juelz Santana]
Sorry, I got to go, I got to get it
But she know how daddy roll I'm coming back home with it
Sometimes I take her with me when I go and get my dough
Because my girl roll harder then some brothers I know
And I know, that she know, I'm by her side, she by my side
And if I ride, then she going to ride, and we going to ride until we die
Now now now now, picture us rolling, in something stolen
Steering wheel twirling, who? Me and my girlfriend

[Chorus]

[Verse 4 - Ace Hood]
I got a chick that'll hold me down
She moving no pounds, when I'm out of town
She ride or die and keep in line she never deny me down
She find me shit that's bigger then grits The baddest bitch around
That's why I let her push the whip and drop the top and down
And give her the stacks you just imagine, you should see the smiles
I have her shipping crates to different places out of town
Baby we balling see them haters they so out of bounds
Let's have a toast, I'm supposed to lay your body down
I spread the money around, give it to you doggy style
See this the remix bay, I might just put that tonguning down
Got to keep it gutter bay, I'm trying to hear that moaning sound
Because you my ride or die it ain't no question about that

[Chorus]
