[Intro]
Yeah, Pizzle
Aahh

[Verse 1]
[?] oxen free, I need a lot of shots in me
I went on a shopping spree for this outfit
Border shit better be bouncing
Let me hear that bass drop
Just drop that bass, drop
By the end of the night, imma have a bad bitch walking 'round with my tank top
So, it's super ready, we all backed up in the chevy
I am flyer than a motherfucking lector licoteli now
Hold me down, gps
Im super lit and i ain't even seen it yet
Let me pull up to the spot and let me get out
Its super swole, I'm so ready to party
I might walk into this bitch and whip my dick out
Open up the door and to my surprise
Everybody just sittin' around in they iPhones thinking 'bout nothin'
Now i know exactly why you wanted me to come through
Cause i came here to party, then leave with something
Since y'all ain't getting lit, here's what we gon' do

[Chorus]
Everybody take your clothes off, take your clothes off
Take your clothes off, take your clothes off
Take your clothes off, take your clothes off
Take your clothes off, take your clothes off
Now I know exactly why you wanted me to come through
Cause Imma be the life of the party
It's 11:30 all of y'all should be fuckin, fuckin (oh)
It's 11:30 all of y'all should be fuckin, fuckin (oh)
It's 11:30 all of y'all should be fuckin, fuckin (oh)

[Verse 2]
Everybody got shots on me
Oh, put that pretty, pretty pussy on my lap and Imma show you how to make a hundred grand in a week (oh)
We gon drank a couple dranks, we gon smoke a couple blunts and then a [?] gon' make you fall
I like this outfit, girl you better keep that booty bouncing
Henny on the way, bruh
About to turn this shit way up
And my partner just got in town, you know we bout to catch the motherfuckin Wayne, bruh
So, another, hour bitches dancing in the shower
I am on that straight corvosie, you knowIi got the power
Now, hold me down, can't walk
Everybody on that molly and they can't talk
So now they just sittin' around in they iPhones thinking 'bout nothin'
Now I know exactly why you wanted me to come through
Cause I came here to party then leave with something
Since y'all ain't getting lit, here's what we gon do

[Chorus]
Everybody take your clothes off, take your clothes off
Take your clothes off, take your clothes off
Take your clothes off, take your clothes off
Take your clothes off, take your clothes off
Now I know exactly why you wanted me to come through
Cause Imma be the life of the party
It's 11:30 all of y'all should be fuckin, fuckin (oh)
It's 11:30 all of y'all should be fuckin, fuckin (oh)
It's 11:30 all of y'all should be fuckin, fuckin (oh)
