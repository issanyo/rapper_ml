[Intro: T-Pain]
Hmm
Bore bore bore
What do we have here?
Uh! Perfect!

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
(Na na na, HEY! SHOOP)
It's
Been a long time coming
Now baby
I'm officially yours
(Na na na SHOOP)
I've got so much love to give
In my heart I know you see

[Break 1: T-Pain]
You won't believe
The things
I've been
Through to be right here
I almost died just to get to you
I'd go to hell
And to hell again
I'd badly go back and forth
From the mountain tops
From door to door
Let the whole world know

[Refrain 1: T-Pain]
Baby I'm officially yours
What was I doing before
I was official....
Officially yours
(Na na na, SHOOP)
Oooooh look up further no more
Now baby im, officially yours

Now listen to me, HEY!

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Time after time
I told myself to stop this
But you take control over me
Oooh, you know what to do
And it's working
I guarantee it
Please believe it
Go from the mountain tops
Door to door to door
Let the whole world know

[Refrain 2: T-Pain]
Baby I'm officially yours
What was I doing before
I was official....
Officially yours
(Na na na, SHOOP)
Oooooh look up further no more
Now baby im officially yours

[Outro: T-Pain]
(Na na na, SHOOP)
