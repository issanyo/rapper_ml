[Intro - T-Pain & (Kanye West)]
Shawty Snap (Yeah)
Ooooh Oooh (Yeah)
Snap Ya Fingers
Do Ya Step
You Can Do It All By Yourself
(Plain Pat, what up?)

[Verse 1 - Kanye West]
Excuse me but this verse
Has not been Russell Simmons approved uh-uh
You won't see it on Run's house uh-uh
You won't see it at a nun's house
My New York nigga said he heard it at son's house
Talkin' 'bout how this ho is poor as my low is
Baby is my Lois, maybe I'm just bogus
Cause she don't wan't you to buy her a drank
Swizz said she ain't got no money in the bank
And she be standin' there, cause it's cameras
Tryin' to show yo legs off, you ain't Amerie
If I fall in love, a girl gon' live on rodeo
Until that day-o, she take the monorail
And I don't want no girl that will answer to "ayo"
Make it more harder, make me put some work in
You get to flirtin', play her just perfect
Fuck a drank, I'mma buy tha bar if ya worth it

[Verse 2 - T-Pain]
Baby girl, what's your name?
Let me talk to you, let me buy you a drink
I'm T-Pain, you know me
Konvict Music, Nappy Boy, ooh wee
I know the club close at three
What's the chance of you rollin' wit me?
Back to the crib, show you how I live
Lets get drunk, forget what we did

[Hook - T-Pain]
I'mma buy you a drank
Then I'mma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty what'chu think 'bout that
I'll be in the grey Cadillac
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ohh, ooh ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ohh, ooh ooh

[Verse 3 - T-Pain]
Talk to me, I talk back
Lets talk money, I talk that
Crunk Juice Bombs, Oakley Shades
Shawty got class, oh behave
Lets get gone, walk it out (walk it out)
Just like that, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
We gone have fun, you gone see
On that Patr√≥n, you should get like me

[Hook - T-Pain]

[Bridge - T-Pain][x2]
Lets get gone
Walk it out
(Now walk it out think 'bout it, aaahhh snap!)
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self

[Hook - T-Pain]
