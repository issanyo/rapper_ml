[Intro]
I can't wait
I can't wait

[Verse 1: Akon]
I think of you
When the morning comes and the night time goes away (all day)
Don't you ever think that we won't be okay (no way)
There is nothin' stoppin' me from lovin' you
Touchin' and rubbin' and kissin' and huggin' you
What's this feelin' taking over, me?
Baby that's love and it ain't no stoppin' it
I don't know as far as the eyes can see
Pick up the pace and it ain't no droppin' it
Always forever I'll be by your side
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
That's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you in love with me

[Hook: Akon]
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait)

[Verse 2: Akon & T-Pain]
I can't believe
That someone like you will love me endlessly (forever)
If this goes our way my love will always be (eternally)
You have set my mind, my love, my heart so free
Together forever however just you and me
What's this feelin' taking over me
Baby that's love and it ain't no stoppin' it
I don't know as far as the eyes can see
Pick up the pace and it ain't no droppin' it
Always forever I'll be by your side
You're my Bonnie, I'm your Clyde
Cause that's the way that it's gonna be
I'm in love with you and you're in love with me

[Hook: Akon]
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait)

[Bridge: Akon]
To have you right next to me here by my side (I can't wait)
To kiss and caress you girl while I'm holdin' you tight (I can't wait)
Can't imagine life without you, it just ain't right (I can't wait)
I got a whole lot of lovin', and you gon' get it tonight

[Hook: Akon]
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait) Sit down and talk for a minute
Go outside and take a walk for a minute (for a minute)
Just you, and me
(I can't wait)

[Outro]
{"I can't wait."}
{"I can't wait."}
