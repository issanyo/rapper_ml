[Intro]
I wanna dedicate this to my strugglin' bro
Keep pushin' on, keep pushin' on

[Verse 1]
First of the month, check late
Got nothin' to do
Imma roll me a blunt, got drank
Call me a ho or two (yeah)
Now I know that it sound like I'm livin' on the edge
Only you ain't hear the worst
Got the whole house running on the generator
No good food in my frig-i-dator
And I'm late for work

[Hook]
Don't that sound bad, horrible
No inspiration, no goals
I know it sound like, I wanna die
And I know I'm so miserable
But this just so happens to be
The best day of my life

[Verse 2]
Now I don't wanna confuse you, hurtin' on the inside
But I won't let you see
That's why every little dollar, and every little penny
Goes to puttin' that outfit on me
Cause Imma stay fresh to death
Dressed to impress the rest
You know how I do it when I do it
Imma show you how to do it
So you can do it for somebody else
But I still got the house on the generator
No good food in my frig-i-dator
And I'm late for work

[Hook]
Don't that sound bad, horrible
No inspiration, no goals
I know it sound like, I wanna die
And I know I'm so miserable
But this just so happens to be
The best day of my life

[Bridge]
My life, my life
Bottle of Patron, big cup of ice
Drink, drink, drink; drink, drink, drink
Ain't talkin 'bout that bullshit
I'm talkin' like a newspaper
I'm talkin' 'bout the newspaper full of weed, like the whole thang
And Imma roll it up and smoke it
Imma let you think about you
And in the end, you gotta let me do what I do

[Hook x2]
Don't that sound bad, horrible
No inspiration, no goals
I know it sound like, I wanna die
And I know I'm so miserable
But this just so happens to be
The best day of my life
