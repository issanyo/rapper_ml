[Intro: T-Pain]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey
I am when the rich get old and the young get cold
And it ain't no holding back, that's me (that's me)
I don't know how long I got left
So I'm showing these niggas how cold I be (I be)
I can get in yo' vein and move up to yo' brain
And take over your whole ID (ID)
That's me, baby
That's me, baby

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Time we back into this one of a kind spirit
We remembered in the time, we the skies and the limit
Bitch, I'm barely in my prime, this ain't half a division
Got so much shit on my mind I'm mentally in a prison
I'm a man on a mission until I'm out of commission
And when we speaking, they listen
Keys for my kingdom of wisdom
Man, my mommy was tripping, thought I'd be bringing in children
Instead I brought in a million, new home and a ceiling
My empire keep rising, enterprises is building
But the stacks keep on piling, I'm never losing the feeling
My life on autopilot, the world is making me numb
I put my phone on silent just so that I could be one
Knew the day would come when I was finally here
Show the kinger stone, this went a couple of years
I ain't got no fears, now that we made that clear
Let's put one in the air, I'm taking over from here

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey
I am when the rich get old and the young get cold
And it ain't no holding back, that's me (that's me)
I don't know how long I got left
So I'm showing these niggas how cold I be (I be)
I can get in yo' vein and move up to yo' brain
And take over your whole ID (ID)
That's me, baby
That's me, baby

[Verse 2: Joe Budden]
Time to let the dumb fucks have it (okay)
Uncut, somewhat magic, e'rything about the come up was classic
We'd run and cut classes, gun tuck habit
21 Savage and the drummers on some trap shit
Wait, fuck fame I laid a little back
Feel I was ahead of my time, they ain't saying that
Bad bitch calling her Snoop, I make her take a cab
She gon' doggy style all night, she hate laying flat
Yup, to me it sound like a win-win
Group text, you chicks free and get a win-win
Back to my legacy, it's longevity
It's ten bathrooms in a mansion that I never see
Shots come my way, that's my speciality
If they ever said my name, it wasn't said to me
Plus, I never half-ass in the game
When both Joe's is badass you get pain

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Hey
I am when the rich get old and the young get cold
And it ain't no holding back, that's me (that's me)
I don't know how long I got left
So I'm showing these niggas how cold I be (I be)
I can get in yo' vein and move up to yo' brain
And take over your whole ID (ID)
That's me, baby
That's me, baby
