[Intro] – T-Pain
Yea

Break
Yea

[Verse 1 - T-Pain]
Throw me in a cage with a lion and a bear (Ima kill em)
That motivation I ain't lyin I swear (Im the nigga)
I got my ear to the streets
Back to the bullshit
Im tryna eat
Im on my full shit
Homie I can't listen to what you saying stop talkin
Betta watch the way you talk to my clan homie start walkin
Wait a minute when a nigga really get it Ima go off
I’m gotta prove it to him
I think Im Big Meech
Larry Hoover

[Hook - T-Pain]
Ima tryna eat
You tryna sleep
If you a dog
Then Ima beast
And the beat goes
Boom ba ba boom ha haaa
I know you hate it
Boom ba ba boom ha haaa
Here go my motivation bruh
Im with my dogs
Fuck us, no nigga fuck ya’ll and the beat goes
Boom ba ba boom ha haaa
If you know they hate it
Boom ba ba boom ha haaa
Let me get you motivated

[Verse 2 - K21]
It’s K21 I promise, I’ll go the hardest
I’ve been motivated and trained, you can call me Thomas
Get It? Where’s the confetti, the fireworks and the pyro
So I came here for nothing, all the way from Cairo
13 years old and already the one to beat
Sittin’ in my suite, twitter watch me tweet nigga
Complete winner, discrete hitter
You’re an offbeat quitter
These beats are my babies, I’mma baby sitter
Came on this beat and fucked it, I’m motivated
Sorry, I guess I masturbated
No sex before marriage
Muslim….so I’m patient
This is why I’ve waited
Is that why u hated?
I’m underrated, degraded
But T-Pain is here to solve that
When u hear this call back
I’ll prEVOLVE, then rEVOLVE
Now give me a piece of
Young Fyre’s beats
Cuz he hot
I like this beat, beat box
Now I got to go
PEACE OFF
