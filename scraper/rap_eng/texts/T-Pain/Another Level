[Verse 1]
Hey, I know they feeling it, I’m killing it all
Hey, I know they feeling it, I’m killing it all
Hey, I know they feeling it, I’m killing it all
I love this shit, I fuck with this, we on
Patron shots, turn up a notch, we gone
How does it feel babe, you all up in my zone
And I keep it real babe, I want to take you home

[Hook]
And I be hollering bartender, we need another round
I’m buying out the bar with her, you know it’s going down
We about to turn up to another level
Give me that white and that brown and I got you covered
Oh by the end of the night, I think Imma love her
Right now, right now, right now, turn up to another level
Give me that white and that brown and I’ll make your day
How do you feel about going all the way
How do you feel about going all the way
Going all the way

[Verse 2]
I got that lift, now go and hit this shit and get into your zone
I’m about to roll another from that loud pack, that loud pack, that strong
Yeah I keep it social, baby girl if you want some don’t be shy, just let me know
If you want to do something real just for the night
We on the way to that upper level, that drink almost gone
You need some more in your cup, fucking right
And I be hollering bartender, give me two double shots of crown
Cause we need to be turned just right, you know it’s going down

[Hook]
And I be hollering bartender, we need another round
I’m buying out the bar with her, you know it’s going down
We about to turn up to another level
Give me that white and that brown and I got you covered
Oh by the end of the night, I think Imma love her
Right now, right now, right now, turn up to another level
Give me that white and that brown and I’ll make your day
How do you feel about going all the way
How do you feel about going all the way
Going all the way

[Verse 3]
Baby I know that you ain’t got nowhere to go now
And as we leave this place, go and [?}​ cup, it’s bout to go down
Come on now shawty, put on a show now
It’s Nappy Boy up in this bitch, if you ain’t know you bout to know now
Now we might have to turn up, she just topped the bottom of that bottle
If you ain’t feel it yet you know I got more
That 5 hour energy, Nuvo and Hennessey, take it full throttle

[Hook]
And I be hollering bartender, we need another round
I’m buying out the bar with her, you know it’s going down
We about to turn up to another level
Give me that white and that brown and I got you covered
Oh by the end of the night, I think Imma love her
Right now, right now, right now, turn up to another level
Give me that white and that brown and I’ll make your day
How do you feel about going all the way
How do you feel about going all the way
Going all the way
