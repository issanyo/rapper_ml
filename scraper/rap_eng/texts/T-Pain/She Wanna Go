(Intro)
Ahh, yeah

(Verse 1)
She want that back breaker
I made a way for her
And now she need it, need it, need it
I be that undertaker
I take my baby down
Soon as I see it, I beat it, I eat it
I grab that money maker
She want it rubbed tonight
So imma squeeze it, squeeze it, squeeze it
Does that feel good baby
My only goal is to that booty is to
Please it, please it, please it

(Bridge)
So imma tie my baby down and show her what I can do
When she can't move, can't move, can't move
And I can see it in her eyes
I think I know it’s that new what she came to do

(Chorus)
Tonight, she wanna go hard
Harder than we’ve ever gone before
Ouu, she put me in charge
She want it on the bed and on the floor
Ouu, she wanna go deep, (deep)
Deeper than we’ve ever gone down, (down x4)
She ain't playin round, I can be in charge
As long as I can go hard

(Verse 2)
I be that cake baker
She knows I put it down how she like it, like it, like it
Girl we gon wake the neighbours
She screamin’ tellin’ me she want that icin’, icin’, icin’
She can barely take it
She love it so much now she pullin’, scratchin’, bitin’
I got her butt naked
Up against that wall it sound like we fightin’, fightin’, fightin’


(Bridge)
So imma tie my baby down and show her what I can do
When she can't move, can't move, can't move
And I can see it in her eyes
I think I know it’s that new what she came to do

(Chorus)
Tonight, she wanna go hard
Harder than we’ve ever gone before
Ouu, she put me in charge
She want it on the bed and on the floor
Ouu, she wanna go deep, (deep)
Deeper than we’ve ever gone down, (down x4)
She ain't playin round, I can be in charge
As long as I can go hard

(Verse 3)
Whips and chains
She ain’t even seen it comin
Keep it goin
1 PM, 2 or 3 or somethin’ yeah
Say my name over and over girl
I know I do it right
You ain't gotta tell me
Girl I feel you

(Chorus)
Tonight, she wanna go hard
Harder than we’ve ever gone before
Ouu, she put me in charge
She want it on the bed and on the floor
Ouu, she wanna go deep, (deep)
Deeper than we’ve ever gone down, (down x4)
She ain't playin round, I can be in charge
As long as I can go hard
