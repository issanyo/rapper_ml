[Intro]
(Six-pack!) Some people like thighs {ayy-yeah}
(Fo'-pack!) Some people like backs {yeahhh}
(Six-pack!) Some people like booty {ayy-yeah}
(Fo'-pack!) Ain't nothin wrong with that {yeahhh}
(Six-pack!) Ain't nothin mo' groovy
(Fo'-pack!) Then when that stomach moving, yeah
It's the reason that I'm singin this song
Because I don't got nothin else to bust a nut on
{Ohhh-hoo-ohhh-ho-hoooo}
Whoa whoa whoa whoa-ohhh, yeah!

[T-Pain]
Tight in the front, fat in the back, that's the way I like it
My fire's ignited, I love it when she ride it (ride it)
Cause I can see the part of her that I love the most (most)
I know they're feelin me from coast to coast (coast)
Cause I like that tank top, that cut off shirt
Manm I like everythang, that show that belly ring (yeah)
Them crunches just got me punchin the wall
And the pilates got that body lookin good up in them boy-short drawers (woo woo)
But that stomach (woo woo), yeah (whoahh) and you don't know

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shorty got that six-pack, fo'-pack you already know that
I'm in love with yo' stomach
Lay on your back you already know that
I'm in love with yo' stomach
Six-pack, fo'-pack you already know that
I'm in love with yo' stomach
It's the reason that I'm singin this song
Cause nothin else turns me on like yo' stomach
Whoa whoa whoa whoa-ohhh

[T-Pain]
Oooh I like the way it move when she do only when she dances
Got your boy thinkin 'bout gettin in them pants
Feelin like y'all bought some brand new J's
She make me wanna throw some D's on her - okay~!
Mman I like that tank top, but I'm about to take it offff
I should be payin money, I'm a have her walkin funny
Them crunches just got me punchin the wall
And the pilates got that body lookin good in the mall short drawers
But that stomach, yeah (whoahh) no, no, no!

[Hook]

[Tay Dizm]
Gal! Tay Dizm, I got it, Tay Dizm
I got a bad little roni and you already know
And I'm addicted to the way that she make her stomach roll
5'6 and she thick and lil' momma lovin this dick
And all the sex and the love that we makin it be the shhhh
She got me on that sprung, and she not on that dumb
One that I'm seriously thankin of settlin down with
But could it be my mind playing tricks on me, she got me excited
The way that she move her stomach put my mind back in Hawaii
I never been a freaky type, but yo' stomach's lookin right
Ay gal, ay gal, ay ay!

[Hook]
