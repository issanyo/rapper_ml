[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Girl why you mad (why you mad)
I know (know)
Exactly what time it is
You ain’t gotta tell me (you ain’t gotta tell me)
So what’s up with the yelling (what’s up with the yelling)
Shorty I was up in the club (club)
Really turned up (up)
Chilling just minding my bis'
I wasn’t doing nothing wrong (wasn’t doing nothing wrong)
Girl you know that I was coming home

[Verse 2: Melanie Fiona]
I’m just saying
It feels like forever you been gone
Where did you go (where did you go)
And how do I know (I know)
It ain’t a lie (ain’t a lie)
Cause it seems like it never takes this long
For you to come back
Boy tell me where your phone is
You a grown man

[Hook]
It’s six in the morning
Conversation got boring
And I been waiting up for him
Six in the morning
Why did my lover not answer
I was somewhere with a dancer
It’s six in the morning
Oochy wally wally you been at a party
Getting all kinds of naughty
It’s six in the morning
Too many lies, not enough time
Four and five, six in the morning
It’s 6am, It’s 6am, It’s 6am, It’s 6am

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
It’s way too early (too early)
Calm down (down)
You ain’t gotta jump in my face
I’m bout to go to sleep (I’m bout to go to sleep)
Holla at me round three (holla at me round three)
(Girl, Girl) Girl I been drinking
And I can’t even make up a lie right now
With you in my ear (with you in my ear)
Shorty I was just playing (I’m listening)
What are you saying?

[Verse 4: Melanie Fiona]
Boy who the hell you really think you’re talking to
If only you knew (if only you knew)
What I had planned for you (for you) you woulda been here
Coulda had had my loving
Instead you out there clubbing (that ain’t cool)
And you ain’t even pick up the phone
I’m tired of being all alone

[Hook]

[Outro: Melanie Fiona & T-Pain]
What your ass doing up anyway, anyway
Fuck that I was sitting here worried about you
I been on my grind all week (like me)
I was just trying to grab me a drink
You could of picked up the phone
And let your girl know
Cause love should of brought you home

[Hook]
