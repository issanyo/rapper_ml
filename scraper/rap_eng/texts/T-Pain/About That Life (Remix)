(Feat. Fabolous, T-Pain, Rick Ross, Nelly)

Look, I terminate a bitch, like her name was Sarah Connor
Where I'm from, we never meet daddies, swear mommas
I'm high fashion, so my Gucci reeks of marijuana
My shoes are killing them, I call these a pair of homi-
Cides, put me in the passenger and I'mma
Ride, cause my mind was full of massacres
Kill em versus I lay em down and fill up herses
You can't be the best without knowing who the worst is
Me and Kay are a lot alike, we don't fake nothing
Thick bitches in my sheets, I be straight stunting
You got the wrong keys, I ain't who to start with
Rise of apes, now who you monkeys getting smart with?

Hook:
I'm bout that money, I'm bout that fitty
I'm down to get it by any means necessary
I'm bout that drama, I'm bout that strife
Now fuck with me or with my team
And you gonna see
Bi-bi-bi-bitch I'm bout that life!
Go-goin hard go-goin in
Tryina get what I can get before these people give me 25
To life, now tell them hatin ass niggas
That hatin only make ya die quicker
Cause bitch I'm bout that life!

In love with the money, infatuated with coupes
Immaculate living, money stacked up to my roof
The baddest of women, purse matchin the boots
That's the half you don't wanna see what's in that fuckin bag
Pull it like a flip cam, first you aim it, then you fire
Big out-smoke a nigga, I can get no higher
Hella bad heroine in every bag she carry on
You niggas ain't getting money, fuck it, and carry on
The biggiest and the richest fucking self made
Ricky rose and my nigga Kay slay
Pound of purple green, 2 liter of pink Sprite
I could flip a brick before a chick can blink twice, ah!

Hook:
I'm bout that money, I'm bout that fitty
I'm down to get it by any means necessary
I'm bout that drama, I'm bout that strife
Now fuck with me or with my team
And you gonna see
Bi-bi-bi-bitch I'm bout that life!
Go-goin hard go-goin in
Tryina get what I can get before these people give me 25
To life, now tell them hatin ass niggas
That hatin only make ya die quicker
Cause bitch I'm bout that life!

You know what? You don't like me, I don't give a fuck
Respect is like some money to me, I don't get enough!
Like I ain't put on the hardest city in America
Saint Louis, and we ain't scared of ya!
King of the drama, see me rollin' with the drama king
Yo Kay slay where the momma from your magazine?
You know the one that's got a body like a cartoon
Ass like a whale, tell her Dirty got a harpoon
This stacking racks on racks
Go check my hallways motherfucker, placks on placks
This niggas lie and lie, I'm speaking facts on facts
My hotel room infested dirty, rats on rats

Hook:
I'm bout that money, I'm bout that fitty
I'm down to get it by any means necessary
I'm bout that drama, I'm bout that strife
Now fuck with me or with my team
And you gonna see
Bi-bi-bi-bitch I'm bout that life!
Go-goin hard go-goin in
Tryina get what I can get before these people give me 25
To life, now tell them hatin ass niggas
That hatin only make ya die quicker
Cause bitch I'm bout that life!

Looking at a dollar bill, saw the White House
Then I flipped the couple bills, bought a White House
Triple beam on a triple stack, triple back
Going backcourt like I dribble back, simple fact
When that drop roll up and that top fold up
Them bitches goin both ways like they bipolar
Pop the ace Black Jack, ski mask black neck
Hit the back of your head, turn your fitty to a snap back
They're still for greatness
Bought the pussy and pay for maintenance
Waste of money, whack head, the bitch brainless
Word that Kay slay you nigga straight stunning
I'll be spending seven digits like it ain't none!

Hook:
I'm bout that money, I'm bout that fitty
I'm down to get it by any means necessary
I'm bout that drama, I'm bout that strife
Now fuck with me or with my team
And you gonna see
Bi-bi-bi-bitch I'm bout that life!
Go-goin hard go-goin in
Tryina get what I can get before these people give me 25
To life, now tell them hatin ass niggas
That hatin only make ya die quicker
Cause bitch I'm bout that life!
