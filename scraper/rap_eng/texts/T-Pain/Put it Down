[Intro: T-Pain]
Ayy... whassup girl?
What took you so long to get over here?
Tchk, stop playin, hehehe... who?
Don't worry about if I carry 'em around
If I didn't have one you would be mad
Don't worry about that I got that, ehehe
T-Pain! Ay

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Baby give me a reason so I can touch you how I want to
And make love to you how them other lame niggas want to
Go on girl what you gon' do?
On my nappy head you can pull my nappy dreads if you want to
Shawty I'mma put it on you
And make you think that you the girl that I be singin' all my songs to
You got me thinkin' that me and you into drankin'
When you sippin that Patron that woulda been done got it on boo
But for now we could just kiss and chill
You never had love makin' like this, for real
Come on baby it's just appeal
Now take it down slow, let me take it down low, let's go
So you know it's about to go down now
Speed it up baby, can't slow down now
Tell ya closet freak she can come out now
Why you think they call me Teddy Penderazdoun?

[Hook: Ray Lavender]
And now I know, you didn't expect me to go low
Now you know
From the top to bottom, now that I got you
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh
Now I know, you didn't expect me to just
Turn you 'round, spread it out, and put it down
From the top to the bottom, and now that I got you
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
You got a nigga on swole like a T-Pain show in Tallahassee
Never put that ass on hold, I'm too nasty
Don't never underestimate T-Pain
You shoulda known when I was bitin' on your belly button chain
That you 'bout to receive some of that guitar tongue
Tryin' to tell me not to do it, like you don't want none
Tryin' to sit up in the bed, tryin' to act all calm
Actin like it ain't good, tryin' to hold that cum
But you know that I'm the best, you know you Teddy Verset'
This the first ten minutes, you ain't feel shit yet
I got the whips, I got the chain, I got the handcuffs too
But ain't none of that for me, I'm 'bout to handcuff you
That's the freaky shit I keep on skeetin' shit that leave you leakin' shit
That take her ass back to the church preacher and deacon shit
I'm beatin' it, let's try +Computer Love+, I keep deletin' it
I'm fuckin on the dresser, the bedroom floor, and the sheets and shit

[Hook: Ray Lavender]
And now I know, you didn't expect me to go low
Now you know
From the top to bottom, now that I got you
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh
Now I know, you didn't expect me to just
Turn you 'round, spread it out, and put it down
From the top to the bottom, and now that I got you
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh

[Interlude: T-Pain]
What'chu doin'..?
Take your pants off
Not that fast, do it slower
You gon', you gon' kill the, ruin the mood
Move your hand, lemme see

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Baby girl, why don'tcha let a nigga slide in them guts
My little man wanna hide them guts
I'mma take my {*tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick, tick*}
Time with them guts
And baby girl when I'm in them guts
You ain't got to worry 'bout yo' man cause
I bet he can't do it like me (nope, nope)
Bet he can't do it like me (nope, nope)

[Hook: Ray Lavender]
And now I know, you didn't expect me to go low
Now you know
From the top to bottom, now that I got you
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh
I'mma stick stick stick stick, ooh
Now I know, you didn't expect me to just
Turn you 'round, spread it out, put it down
