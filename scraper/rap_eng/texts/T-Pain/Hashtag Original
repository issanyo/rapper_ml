Hashtag I’m on my new shit
Hashtag leave me alone
Hashtag bitch let me do this
Hashtag quit callin' my phone

I know she’s going through it
I know she in that zone
Just want to listen to music
Just want to be on her own
(On her own)
You got too many friends to disappear on us girl
Let us know what’s going on
Stop staring at that Facebook wall and clear this up girl
And all she said was…

Hashtag I’mma be ok
Hashtag I’m doing me
Hashtag let me get one day
Hashtag privacy please

Ain’t tryna be in your business
I call it, how I see
Stop with the posting, and you’ll get that privacy that you need
(That you need, yeah)
Cause you been goin' in today just sayin' girl
You got all of us worried about ya
You got something to say to us, then just say it girl

But she said nevermind and left it at that
So I left it alone
Then she hopped in the Lac
Then she hopped on her phone
And was like;
(Hashtag) I don’t care
(Hashtag) Get a life
(Hashtag) Stay over there
(Hashtag) And I was like damn
