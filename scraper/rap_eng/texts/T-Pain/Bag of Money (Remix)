M-M-M-M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music
She self made too, therefore she winning (Yeaaah-ee)
New Money, MMG, Self Made 2 (Ey-ey-ey-ey-ei-ee)
Taking over the world (Yea-ey-ey-ey-ey-ei-ee)
C'mon baby girl let's spend this money (Yeah-eah, oooh-ooh-whoo)

[Chorus: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)

[Verse 1: Wale]
Be like Wa-le my stroke game be on point
Yeah, shawty losing her mind her composure most of her voice
And she say she hate the word moist but she can't escape from that vibe
You can play fight with that cat, me I kill that pussy 9 times
I slow it down, let me slow it down
Ever since I hit that look at it that shit, I got you pokin' now
Numbers we ain't throwin' down, not me, no way, no how
Cause you know them screenshot broads always gonna run they mouth
Ok I'm far too drunk I'm not driving (what's up?), you know open bars are on fire
A little green and white in my pocket, so this song is now "Bag of Mara"
Caught up in the wrong timing, yeah, Jacob made my medallion
Just post up but don't coach much, but I love the stadium talent

[Verse 2: Omarion]
Bright lights picture, all right colors
I'll let you count my money, don't think that you own me
You my bag of my money, you my bag of honey
I beez in your trap, while you yellin' fuck me
I be on some other shit
Maybach all up in this bitch
Tell you about them other niggas
They be lying about they figures - I'm bout it, bout it I pull the trigger
Y'all be so lame
We killin' the game; I dance in the bank
We so mafioso you ain't never know though
Never gonna know so, no never no, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Ooooh, she bad)

[Verse 3: Yo Gotti]
My bitch amazin', show stopper
Work at the titty club, pussy popper
Top drop white on white 645
I burnt her up from 5 O'clock until 6:45
Mr 60 minutes, Mrs Chanel and Fendi
I hit her in the Porsche and burnt her up a new Infiniti
Presidential Rollie, JFK she Mrs. Kennedy
Rose gold his or hers, diamonds and furs
Want a little suede, one on one bag
Look like a duffle bag of money, she beyond that
And I'm beyond swag, young thug nigga
Drug dealer; MMG affiliated blood nigga

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Uh, my-my bitch mad cause I'd rather get that money
I give her this dick she say that dick better than money
I say "Can I get some head?" She say let me get my scrunchie
Serve her like a country, got that dope dick, she a junkie
She say "Tunechi this your pussy", I say "tell me anything"
Then I suck her nipple ring, eat that pussy, Listerine
She coming, I make sure my bitch bad; she'll take yours
And she do tricks on that dick like a skateboard

[Chorus: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Ooooh, she bad)

[Verse 4: French Montana]
I push the drop and let her ride shotty
My bitch bad lookin' like a bag of mollies
Hit the crib, make a porno, my diamonds flash like photos
500 on my auto and I bought it out, fuck car note
Shorty know exactly who the realest is
Murder that AHH, leave no witnesses
Started from the streets, turned to business
Dirty bag of money, stack it to where that ceiling is

[Verse 5: Black Cobain]
Rollin' up some killer, ridin' through my city
Bumpin' bag of money, got a bag of money with me
She conceited, she know that, she was down with a nigga before rap
If I had the strap she would hold that, she don't even smoke but she'll roll that
For me she drinkin' Henny she don't like it though
She fuck with real niggas cause that's all she know
Make her pop that pussy hole, make her bring that money back
You niggas couldn't fuck my bitch if you gave her a hundred stacks

[Chorus: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Ooooh, she bad)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)
My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Yea-ea-ea-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Hey-ey-eh-ey-ei-ee)
I blow it fast so you know I got her stuntin' (Ooooh, she bad)

[Bridge: Rick Ross & (T-Pain)]
She got me caught up in the moment (She got me caught up in the moment)
She got me caught up in the moment (She got me caught up in the moment)
I only kiss her when she on it (Ooh, when she on it)
White Ferrari and she got me doin' donuts, hol' up (Oooh-ooh-whoo)
