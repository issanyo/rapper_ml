[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Girl just close your eyes and picture me playin your Spanish guitar

Weezy Baby

I Got them Bangin Drums
She Got them Alicia Keyes
Ooh Girl Lets Make A Beat
Ooh Girl You Make Me Weak
Like Every Time The Track Break
Make The Control Room Boom Like An 808
And If You Walk Your Thong Into This Vocal Booth
I Can Guarantee I'm A Make This Song All About You
And You Know I Got that Drank
You Know I Got that Stank
It's Amazin How I Think
But I Do So
And Every Time I Meet A Girl
She Tell Me That She Sang
And I Say I Gotta House Wit A Studio
I'm Jus Tryna Do My Thang Baby
Video or Audio

Make Me Wrap Yo Ass Up
Like A Hot 16
And I Promise You Ain't Wanna Hear Nobody Else Flow
Welcome To My Studio
You Gon Love My Studo

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Do you mind if I pluck upon your string for one minute?
And do you mind if I do some nasty things for one minute?
Girl If I could I would, I would stroke your body like I do my keyboard
Are your ready? Ready to do something you never did before
