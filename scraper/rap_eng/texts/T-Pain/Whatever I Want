[Intro: T-Pain]
Put your hands up, listen
Go do whatever you want
Put your hands up
Go do, go do whatever you want

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I can fly, I can scale a tall building in a leap
I'm a robot, I don't really need no sleep
I can breathe underwater, I can swim for days
I do whatever I want and disappear in a haze
I'mma let you think 'bout that
I'mma let you think 'bout that

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Ain't nothing you can do about it
Ain't nothing you can say to me
Oh no, they can't stop me now
I'mma do whatever I want

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I can do anything I want
I don't give a damn
Cause you just get the consequence
And all I get is confidence
To do whatever I want
I can do anything I want
I don't give a damn
Cause you just get the consequence
And all I get is confidence
Do whatever I want
Do whatever I want

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Ain't nothing you can do about it
Ain't nothing you can say to me
Oh no, they can't stop me now
I'mma do whatever I want

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I can do anything I want
I don't give a damn
Cause you just get the consequence
And all I get is confidence
To do whatever I want
I can do anything I want
I don't give a damn
Cause you just get the consequence
And all I get is confidence
Do whatever I want
Do whatever I want
