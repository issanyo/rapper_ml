Throw me in a cage with a lion and a bear (Ima kill em)

Betta watch the way you talk to my clan homie start walkin
Wait a minute when a nigga really get it Ima go off
I’m gotta prove it to him

Larry Hoover

[Verse 2: Sean Steel]
My Name Is Sean Steel The Realist Damn Deal
The Bitches Ain't Shit They Just A Bunch Of Posers
You Claim You Better But I'm The Weather
Your Rap Style Is Softer Than A Feather
I Can Ball All Over You Fucking Fools
I Ball So Hard They Couldn't Make You Change Schools
But Don't Kiss Up And Act Like Your Cool With Me
There's Three Reasons You Should Never Fuck With Me
My Technique And Flow Is Gonna Kill
Go Home And Try To Make A So Called Skill
I'm Addicted To You Like Your Goddamn Pill
But Hey Least I Can Keep My Own Damn Will
Making All That Doe Never Trusting A Ho
I'm Reppin' My Town This Is Saint Joe
Thinking I'm Fake Bitch Please Look Who's Talking
I Got My Motivation You Better Start Walking

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm trying to eat, you trying to sleep
If you a dog, then I'm a beast
And the beat goes
I know you hate it, here go my motivation
Bro, I'm with my dolls, fuck us? no nigga, fuck y'all
And the beat goes
If you know they hate it, let me get you motivated
