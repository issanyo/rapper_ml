[Intro: Diddy]
I'll do anything for you... for you I'll change the world
No more wars, no more poverty, no more hurt, no more pain
You showed me how to love you again, for you I change the world
Pain sing...

[Hook: T-Pain]
If I could chaaaange the world
Ooh... I would be the sunlight in your universe
Ooh... you will think my love was really something good baby
If I could chaaaa-aaaa-aaaange {*2X*}
If I could chaaaange the world, the world, the world, the world

[T-Pain]
Ooh there would be no more wars
Opportunity knockin' on doors for us, for us
Nobody ain't known each other
Buddies turning into lovers for us, for us
Oh when the moonlight turns to sunshine
Everybody waking up to abandon dreams (Uh-uh uh-uh)
Cause everybody need what they want
But don't want what they need; let's talk about unity
Changing the world!

[Hook] w/ ad-libs

[Akon]
If I could change the world
I order for the line to be erased that the border this day (this day, everyone deserves an opportunity)
There be no new world order
If nobody wouldn't never got slaughtered that way (that way, that means so much more love and unity)
Daughters will be close to their mothers
Sons will be raised by their fathers today (today, a good family ain't nothing greater)
Races crimes, hate crimes will never exist, I'll turn everyone into a Hershey's kiss (kiss)
And we can eat away our fear (fear), ooooh

[Hook] w/ ad-libs

[Mary J. Blige]
There would be no self hate
We will all have to love everything about ourselves, so we can love everyone else
Nothing would hold us down
Because we'll all walk around with a smile and never frown and that will remove those clouds
There'll be no more self-loathing
Everyone will know in their hearts that they just fine and that's when the light's gonna shine
Everyone will understand
In order to have some peace you must believe, believe the best in you
Believe I can change

[Hook] w/ ad-libs
