Make you feel like Heaven (Heaven) twenty four seven (Seven)
I'm hot as ice now, oh!

If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire, baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down
