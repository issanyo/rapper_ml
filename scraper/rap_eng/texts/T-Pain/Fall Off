[Verse 1]
Told her I was going to Miami
But she don't like that idea, she know why I'm outchea
Told her I was gonna see my family
But there's way too many fans and them bands will make her dance
I can accommodate anybody, everybody
I don't wanna wait
I just wanna feel that body up against mine
But that's not what's happenin'

[Hook]
I go somewhere alone, hop up on that wagon
Then I fall off, fall off, fall off
Hop up on that wagon
Then I fall off, fall off, fall off
Girl, I'm just relaxing
I've been in my room alone for days
Negativity won't go away, that's when I fall off
So I move some, then you ask what I'm doing
I say, ooh, nothing
Then I fall
I say, ooh, nothin' then I fall, fall
Oh, I fall

[Verse 2]
I told her she can call me if she wanna
But she want in on background
Don't do me like that now
One more sip and I'm a goner
Ain't no telling what i do
I've been stuck inside this room
I'm alone with my thoughts
Trust me I'm tempted, but I know I'mma get caught
Instead i get lifted on something, I can barely talk
And of course you call
Now, I keep thinking that you thinking that I'm doing you wrong
Girl, i can't imagine
'Cause you already think you know whats happenin'

[Hook]
I go somewhere alone, hop up on that wagon
Then I fall off, fall off, fall off
Hop up on that wagon
Then I fall off, fall off, fall off
Girl, I'm just relaxing
I've been in my room alone for days
Negativity won't go away, that's when I fall off
So I move some, then you ask what I'm doing
I say, ooh, nothing
Then I fall
I say, ooh, nothin' then I fall, fall
Oh, I fall

[Outro]
I fall, I fall, yeah
I fall, I fall, woo
I fall, i fall, ai
I fall, I fall, oou
I fall, I fall, woo
I fall, I fall, oou
I fall, I fall, woo
I fall, I fall yeah
