(Nigga) I ain't worried bout nothin (4x)
Ha
(Nigga) I ain't worried bout nothin (4x)
Ha

[Verse 1]
Man, I be putting in work
I'mma never let them beat me
Got a couple bitches in the club with me
And both of the gon' get freaky
I ain't got no problem spending all of my money
Niggas already known what I do
In case you forgot or something
I'mma hit you in the face with a cadillac drop or something

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Grammys all on my shelf
Lamborghini's all in my yard
I gotta protect myself
Nigga I done worked to hard
So that gun rack got that SK
And that AK, and I love everyone of them shits
But I got too many goons
So I ain't gotta shoot none of them shits
People keep sayin' I'm broke
Like I ain't connected to shit
I got checks coming in
I could stay at home in the bed stretching and shit
I got the game on lock so somebody invested in this kid

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Still getting checks from niggas albums
Still getting checks from Kiss Kiss
Still getting checks from Win
And Buy You A Drank, still make yo bitch split
Still getting checks from Budweiser
Still getting checks from Wal-Mart
He got that auto-tune mic
He just doing what he oughta do, right?
Knock out that ball park
Man, I'm still all up in movies dog
You ain't gotta worry bout me
I'm better, hotter than ever
Nigga you can ask Tyrese
Fuck yo swag, I put on that top hat
Niggas said I dress like a kid
But how many niggas that you know
That can dress like that and still do all the shit that I did
Got yo girl twerking on twitter
I'm still in love with that stripper
So all three of us are gon' hit the bar
To go holla at the bartender
Yall keep on hating on me
You know I don't give a fuck
Cause when I step up in the building
(Haha I don't gotta say it...)
