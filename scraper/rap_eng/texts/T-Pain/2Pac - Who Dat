[Intro: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac]
Ay nigga

[Hook: DJ Chop Up as 2Pac, T-Pain]
Makaveli, straight outta Death Row
They wanna know
(Who the fuck is that?)
Niggas get they caps peeled back
Fool it's the west coast
They wanna know
(Who the fuck is that?)
Intoxicated, we duplicated but never faded
They wanna know
(Who the fuck is that?)
They wanna know
(Who the fuck is that?)
These motherfuckers wanna know
(Who the fuck is that?)

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Ever since I was a young scrub
I was a thug on the corner with my niggas slangin drugs
I'm running from the narcs when they pass by
Don't ask why
I'm a hustler till my ass die
Even if I do come up I be ready when they run up, huh
I'll be a nut to put my gun up, huh
I never trust these hoes at all
Fucking with them tramp ass sluts who supposed to fall
Since she played you for you money but the shit was cool
Guess its true niggas be bitches too
You can't see how she worked you, all up in her skirt
Now you looking like a jerk, cause she hurt you
Now heads up, don't be a player hater
Just peep game keep your mind on your money
Watch the bitch change
See hoes love thugs, and thugs love loot
Hand it over motherfucker before I shoot

[Verse 2: 2Pac]
Livin that
Thug life baby, steady smoking Indo going crazy
Baby come and hug me when you rub me
Turn the lights down
We in the dark do you love me
Everybody is talking bout they know me
But they ain't down like my motherfucking homies
Tell me what you need when you see me
And we can get it on biatch, take it easy
Don't try to hold me, control me
But you can take my number
Baby call me when you lonely
'Cause its a man's world, ain't no need to ask why
I'm high till I die, and strapped with my 4-5
'Cause you can lose it in the gutter
I wonder if I die by the hands of another broke motherfucker
They call me the alcoholer I'm all in, thug 4 life nigga ballin
