[intro]
Yeah, oh baby
Yeah, ah, now baby

[Verse 1]
Please don't do this right before I leave
You gon' make me fall apart, oh baby
I was so stupid, too many tricks up my sleeve
All I did was break your heart, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know what I did, I know it was wrong
The only thing I don't know is why it happened at all
Oh baby
I got a flight to catch, baby
I don't wanna fight you back
I was wrong, I can't even get mad at all, oh baby

[Chorus]
Cause now I'm sittin' on this airplane
People lookin' at me like I'm crazy
They don't even know what's wrong
But they know it's all my fault
'Cause now I'm sittin' on this airplane and I'm crying like a baby
We might have to turn around
'Cause right about now, I'm wishin' that this plane would just go down

[Post-Chorus]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

[Verse 2]
No excuses, I am on my knees
Confessions are way too hard, oh baby
I'm about to lose it
Why aren't you beside me?
Couldn't let down my guard, oh baby

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know you ain't gon' never come back
I shouldn't have done that and run back for cover
How stupid am I?
Oh baby
And you don't wanna see me again
And you'll never believe me again
Now I'm in 1st class feeling like I've died, oh baby

[Chorus]
'Cause now I'm sittin' on this airplane
People lookin' at me like I'm crazy
They don't even know what's wrong
But they know it's all my fault
'Cause now I'm sittin' on this airplane and I'm crying like a baby
We might have to turn around
'Cause right about now, I'm wishin' that this plane would just go down

[Post-Chorus]
Down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
