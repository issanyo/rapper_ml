Of everything that I got 'cause I've been
Ballin' (ballin'), ballin' (ballin')

I'm fallin' (fallin'), I'm fallin' (fallin')
Up onto that pole

And we gon' have some Patron fun
With a little bit of Henny
And then she gon' be
Crawlin' (crawlin') from the edge of my bed girl (girl)
Your body's (body's) callin' (callin')
And I heard what it said girl
Uh, soon as I pull up in that two-tone
She playin' hard to get but I am too grown
