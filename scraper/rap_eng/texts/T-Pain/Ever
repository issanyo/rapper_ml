[Verse 1]
A thousand rounds, about a million shots
I’m going pound for pound, so I can feel the drop like (woah!)
But I can’t enen feel my hands
But this liquor in my system make me need to go and dance
I - wanna go, hit a thousand chicks, like I got a thousand dicks
But I really need just one, Imma take her to my house 'n shit
Lounge 'n shit, yeah, we gon' drink until we fall
But I’m gon' sip a little bit more 'cause I just can’t feel it at all

[Hook]
Is this love?
I know it ain’t but we can say it is right now
How crazy is this? From the club
Now you 'bout to have the best sex - ever (woah!)
You wouldn’t know I did it like that, shawty
So never say never
Look out below!
We was just up in the club, now we 'bout to have the best sex - ever
You done heard it all before, I guarantee that I do it better
Look out below!
We was just up in the club, and we just had the best sex - ever
Hold up, wait
Ok, you gotta go (Peace!)

[Verse 2]
Back in the club, fresh from under the covers
Mouth still smelling like pussy, hands still smelling like rubbers (Oh yeah!)
What’s up shawty, come and sip on this moscato
Me and my niggas got VIP sections, you think that we just hit the lotto (we got money, oh wait)
Girl you need to understand, that the more that I keep drinking
I’m gon' need to put my hands on that (whoop, go 'head)
Right now we don’t give a damn
But that pussy getting gushy like you peed up in your pants

[Hook]
Is this love?
