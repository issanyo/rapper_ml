[Verse: Eric Bellinger]
Bring that over here, baby girl I know you ain't leavin'
You know you wanna stay, shawty see the way you've been feenin'
So let me put you in the Desk, and give you this nice long evening
Girl, you my number one, call me MJ the way I beat it

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
But if you don't want it, let me keep it, and i'll have it
For whenever you need it, call me, and i'll grab it
But if you do like it
Come back for it, don't fight it
Ooh, how does it feel?
Does it feel like a dream? (dream)

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Baby this is inception
Ooh, and it's just your imagination runnin' away
You give me a kick (kick)
I give you a kiss (kiss)
You give me a suck (suck)
I give you a lick
Girl, this is inception
Ooh, it's just your imagination runnin' away
You tell me you like it (like it)
I know what you mean (mean)
Have you ever been inside a dream, inside a dream, girl?
This is inception

[Verse 20: T-Pain]
Lay down on your stomach, baby girl get ready for this lotion
Now you know that it's comin', 'bout to put the motion in the ocean
What you laughin' for, ain't nobody in this room jokin'
I know you likin' harcore, when your body get into some chokin' (haha)

[Pre-Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
But if you don't want it, let me keep it, and i'll have it (have it)
For whenever you need it, call me, and i'll grab it (girl)
But if you do like it
Come back for it, don't fight it
Ooh, how does it feel?
Does it feel like a dream? (dream)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Baby this is inception
Ooh, and it's just your imagination runnin' away
You give me a kick (kick)
I give you a kiss (kiss)
You give me a suck (suck)
I give you a lick
Girl, this is inception
Ooh, it's just your imagination runnin' away
You tell me you like it (like it)
I know what you mean (mean)
Have you ever been inside a dream, inside a dream, girl?
This is inception

[Verse 3: Mario]
Don't be nervous, girl you're just in time
Baby you can try to fight it, but you don't gitty up when I get up in your mind
Girl, that body's gonna feel a little different
When you wake up to the world, you're gonna miss it
So baby take another nap
And we can talk later 'bout how I was inside you
Baby this is inception

[Chorus: Eric Bellinger]
Baby this is inception
Ooh, and it's just your imagination runnin' away (running away, yeah)
You give me a kick (kick)
I give you a kiss (kiss)
You give me a suck (suck)
I give you a lick
Girl, this is inception
Ooh, it's just your imagination runnin' away (imagination running away girl)
You tell me you like it
I know what you mean (have you ever been inside a dream?)
Have you ever been inside a dream, inside a dream, girl?
This is inception (inception)

[Outro: Eric Bellinger]
Girl, this is inception
Show me your dream
Girl, this is inception
Inception, inception
Girl, this is inception
