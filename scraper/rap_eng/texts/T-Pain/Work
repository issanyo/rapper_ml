[Verse 1]
Man I got stacks of money in my living room
Bitches all with they titties out
Niggas watching my backyard cause that black car can buy Diddy's house
Act hard and I'm kicking out, that 9 stay sticking out
T-Pain looking bad, that don't exist like Hello Kitty's Mouth
Pop the trunk and I'll pack it up
Chevrolet with a few teeth missing
Hit the spot, then I'll back it up
Abracadabra! Them keys shipping
And I'm like give us free, give us free
I'm a boss getting head from 2 hoes unless I hit up 3
I be putting in work

[Hook]
Man I be putting in work
People say my house look like a factory
Federales coming after me
They ain't gonna capture me
Man, I be putting in work
And all these bitches adore me
So, if they looking for me
Tell them mothafuckas I be putting in work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
Work, work, work, work
So if they looking for me
Tell them mothafuckas I be putting in work

[Verse 2]
Now it's imperative, that I take care of this
I snatch yo bitch up out of that tub, man, like Harriet
I know they scared of this, cause ain't no nigga better than what I got on my team
I done got hella rich, I went back to the dreads again
I had to go and get clean
I done surrounded myself with drug dealers
And niggas that just got out
And I don't hang with no fuck niggas
Everybody 'round me got clout
And we hollerin' bout, give us free, give us free
I'm a boss getting head from two hoes unless I hit up 3
I be putting in work

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
10 million won't hurt me, I'm set for life in this shit, nigga
None of y'all niggas gone murk me, I spend a night with your bitch
Than Ima have to end the night, straight licking
Imma spend it right when I get it
Keep my enemies tight, but no slipping
They be feeling the hype when I'm in it
Man, the rhythm be nice when I'm spitting, shitting on them
That shit don't phase me, every last song I drop, hitting on them
Got a basement full of hoes, and me and my wife feeling on them
And they be kissing on me, all like give us free
