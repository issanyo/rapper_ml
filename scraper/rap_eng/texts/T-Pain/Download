[Intro: T-Pain]
Yeah, you already know what it is (Ooh wee)
Yeah, yeah, who it is
Queen B, TP and Charlie
Yeah, when you gon' let me download? (Download)
Whats up?

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shawty, I been lookin' at these pictures of you
Cyber surfin'
So when you gonna call me (when you're flirtin')
When you gonna come through? (what's your fantasy?)
All I wanna do is download
When you gonna let me download?
Shawty up, shawty down low
When you gonnna let me download?

[Verse 1: Lil' Kim]
I'm on Myspace and it's type late
My baby got me number one on his top eight
It's computer love, we don't mind the hate
They just MySpace freaks trynna find a date
We up all night havin' cybersex
He chat, I chat though we never met
He said he wanna explore me like the Internet
It's like an orgasm every time he sent a text
He wanna download, he likes to download
Little Kim songs and put 'em on his ringtone
He even got my screen saver on his iPhone
I get more hits than a T inzone
We goin' back and forth, sendin' emails
He a thug so I hit him on his Gmail
His sense of humor got me writin' LOL
I sent pictures of myself straight to the cell

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shawty, I been lookin' at these pictures of you
Cyber surfin'
So when you gonna call me (when you're flirtin')
When you gonna come through? (what's your fantasy?)
All I wanna do is download
When you gonna let me download?
Shawty up, shawty down low
When you gonna let me download?

[Verse 2: Lil' Kim]
He been lookin' at my sexy pics, said he diggin' my sexy hips
He wanna kiss my sexy lips and download me on his floppy disk
Little Kim is the only one on his mind
He wanna come through and put me on his hard drive
Three o'clock in the morning we be online
Others send friend requests but they get denied
He type I miss you
I type back to let him know the feeling's mutual
It's just Myspace love but it's beautiful
He love to watch my videos on YouTube
Hey, it's like everytime I log on I get so turned on
Computer love playin' in the back (that's my song)
The only one that have me up all night long
Feel like a fantasy, the chemistry is so strong

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shawty, I been lookin' at these pictures of you
Cyber surfin'
So when you gonna call me (when you're flirtin')
When you gonna come through? (what's your fantasy?)
All I wanna do is download

Shawty up, shawty down low
When you gonna let me download?

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Yeah, I'm hopin' you look like your pictures do
When I see you up close and personal so I can touch you
Late night online, you an insomniac
I'm here now, grab me where my hard drive at
I meant what I said when I typed that
Lil' mama scream my name if you like that
Ain't nothin' like computer love

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shawty, I been lookin' at these pictures of you
Cyber surfin'
So when you gonna call me (when you're flirtin')
When you gonna come through? (what's your fantasy?)
All I wanna do is download

Shawty up, shawty down low
When you gonna let me download?
