[T-Pain]
Ooh~! It's dark in here, it's hot in here
Girl what are you doin to me?
Baby stop, not in here
I got a presidential suite
Baby why don't we, just get out of here
Where we can have the freedom to be
Secret lovers under covers, have no fear
Cause

[Chorus]
I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl - I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time
Girl I'm about to blow ya mind, blow ya mind, blow ya mind
Girl - I'm not here to waste ya time, waste ya time, waste ya time
Girl I'm about to blow ya mind

[T-Pain]
Baby now we're here, what'chu wanna do?
I'll let you thank about it for a minute
Don't worry 'bout me, I'm here to satisfy you
Ain't gotta worry about me gettin it in
And your mind your body and your soul comes first to me
It's time to make the temperature rise
But we had to get away, don't want nobody to see
Why? Cause

[Chorus]

[T-Pain]
Baby was it good - satisfactory?
I got time so we can do it again
Was it good for you, like it was for me?
One is not enough let's get the second one in
Baby I know you've been, you've been dyin to see
If I can do your body right
If your baby could, fulfill that one fantasy
One more time, girl cause

[Chorus] - loops in repeat until 3:48
