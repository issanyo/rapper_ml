[Intro: T-Pain]
Nappy Boy ooh-wee, ooh-wee
Everybody say yeah, oh oh oh
Hey, ay-ay-ay-ay

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
We've been messin 'round for a long time, a while now
And you already know what's on my mind, it's goin down now
And I don't need no background music girl, I'll turn it up loud now
I got the gangsta feelin'
And I'mma do somethin' to you, to you, to you
We can take it over to The Bay, where my Mistah FAB at?
Or just put on that N.W.A, comin' *Straight Outta Compton* on that pussy, baby
Or we can do it all night long, I'm 'bout to have yo' head gone
And I ain't doin nothin' wrong, but we can make love to a rap song

[Hook: T-Pain]
Me and you, yo' momma and yo' cousin
Baby we can make love to a rap song
A milli, a milli, a milli, a motherfucker I'm ill
Baby we can make love to a rap song
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
Where that new Jeezy CD? Put on that Yo Gotti
I'm diggin in your coochie while we're listenin to Gucci on a rap song

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
And you been on my mind all day, I know you're with it
And I'mma do you like Kanye, cause "I'ma let you finish" (I'ma let you finish)
You can get it or we can do it East Coast style, and I'll keep on my fitted
I said I got the gangsta feelin
I feel like breakin you off, you off, you off
Or we can take it way down South, Rick Ross on the iPad (cause you the Boss's girl)
Super thick thighs
And your booty like Bombs Over Baghdad
Wait, hold up, she got a donk, she got a donk
She got a donk, I'm 'bout to have yo' head gone
And I ain't doin nothin wrong, but we can make love to a rap song

[Hook: T-Pain]
Me and you, yo' momma and yo' cousin
Baby we can make love to a rap song
A milli, a milli, a milli, a motherfucker I'm ill
Baby we can make love to a rap song
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
Where that new Jeezy CD? Put on that Yo Gotti
I'm diggin in your coochie while we're listenin to Gucci on a rap song

[Verse 3: Rick Ross]
My jeans sag, boy got a mean swag
Right now you're rockin' with the finest, and I mean that
Really, you the finest, and I mean that
Pants fitted, damnit, where your jeans at?
Makin love to a rap song
"Port of Miami," "Trilla," "Deeper Than Rap,"
Like Akon, we can stack it all up
Or do you like I'm Juvi', make you back it all up
That's all shorty ever was, Balenciaga bags cost a couple bucks
Hot Is all shorty ever been
Blow a couple racks in Barney's on that Phillip Lim
Ballin, it's ya birthday
You know that champagne'll get your boy to first base
Haters do they thing, but we do it bigger
Number one niggas, Rozay and that boy Teddy Pender

[Hook x2: T-Pain]
Me and you, yo' momma and yo' cousin
Baby we can make love to a rap song
A milli, a milli, a milli, a motherfucker I'm ill
Baby we can make love to a rap song
Go shawty, it's your birthday
We gon' party like it's your birthday
Where that new Jeezy CD? Put on that Yo Gotti
I'm diggin in your coochie while we're listenin to Gucci on a rap song
