[Intro: T-Pain]
Bitch
Yeah
Been drankin' a little bit
What you wanna say, girl? (Oh yeah)
What you gon' say, girl? (Oh yeah)
Gon' and tell the room, girl (Oh yeah)
Listen, bitch

[Verse: T-Pain]
They call me M.C. Boombox
'Cause when I got a bitch I just boom box
Send her home with no shoes and two socks
Keep the shit real like The Boondocks (Oh yeah)
So call me Teddy McGruder (Oh yeah)
If her nigga act up then I'ma let out the Ruger (Oh yeah)
I done ripped this bitch up, call me Freddy the Kreuger (Oh yeah)
She won't go to sleep, she stay up watchin' me on computers
Damn, she infatuated
Fell in love with my swag and how fast I ate it
But it's not out of the norm when I bring the dick storm
All these bitches be so fascinated and they say (Oh yeah)
Yeah bitch, what you tryna say? (Oh yeah)
What I had you sayin' all day? (Oh yeah)
I got a bitch from New Orleans she said, "Aw yeah"
Said, "Yeah bitch, I know, that's what they all say"
