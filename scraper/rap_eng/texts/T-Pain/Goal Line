You a lil' bit too late, ain't it, moved my mama out the hood, she straight, ain't it
Pour up a four in my Phantom
Pour another four, that's a whole 'nother eight, ain't it
I'm at the goal line with a thick and red bitch
And she won't slow down

I'm pushin' 130, plus I'm ridin' dirty, that shit like a stress test (uh)
After-party go down at the mansion
We gon' leave that bitch a mess, yes (whoo)
Booty and the beast, I need two at least
Bitch, be our guest, yes
Let's just fuck in a better life (nah)
That'll be hella right (scared)
Two chicks kissin' in the bath tub, now they mega-tight (ugh)
They was already friends (ah)
Now they better friends (ooh)
Baby, don't hold back (lil' bitch)
Baby, just let her in (lil' whore)

Both of y'all on the way, ain't a-
All of my bitches got GPS
All of my bitches show up at my place, ain't a-
That dick make 'em feel like they weight trainin'

You been fuckin' with them clown-ass niggas, baby, come and get your face painted, ain't it
(ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: T-Pain & Blac Youngsta]
I'm at the goal line (gang, gang)

Shawty got gold pussy (I swear)
And I hit the goldmine, slow down
I'm at the goal line (fuck nigga)

Shawty got gold pussy
And I hit the goldmine, slow down
