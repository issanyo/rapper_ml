[Chorus]
Drop that bass on you
What'cha think about it?
How does it feel baby?

[T-Pain]

[Chorus]

[T-Pain]

[Chorus]

[T-Pain]
But what if I go down, and further down
And further down, and further down, and further down
To yo' belly chain - psych! (I'm just playin)
But what I'd I go down and further down
And further down, and further down, and further down
Make you say my name - twice! (Yeah)
Now you can try to, fight it if you wanna
But I'm tellin ya baby, this feelin is uncontrollable
And this is the first time for us, so trust, that it's a must

[T-Pain]
Nah, we don't need one
It feels so good without one, don't worry about it

[Chorus]

[T-Pain]

Drop that bass on you
What'cha think about it?
Feels so good baby... yeah
