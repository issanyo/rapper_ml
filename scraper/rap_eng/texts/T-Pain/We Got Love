Ooo

It feels like
I
Can't survive
Like im not alive
But you can revive, me
We love

And i won't even try
To act like
I
Can't say goodbye
Cuz u can revive, me
We love

I want u to hold me
Console me
And i will give u, the whole me

Cuz u got me
And i got you
We got love

Yea

*sigh*
Let it breathe
Let it breathe
Oooooo
I want you to hold me
*sigh*
Ooooo
Leeee-yeaaa-ooooo
Yea-ee
Wanna let it breathe
