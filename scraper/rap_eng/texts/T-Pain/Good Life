Yo i just went to go pledge just now..
And it look like you made the muthafuckin $10,000, nigga
You made the muthafuckin $10,000!
They can't stop you. you're the fucking bomb. you the shit
Blow up on these niggas, start your shit, talk your shit
Do your muthafuckin shit!

Verse 1:
Putting all my pain in a bottle
Putting all my fear in it too
Way too many days that’s been malo
Way too many days that’s been blue
If i can choose to be what i wanna be
Then imma be love
And imma be light
And it’s gon be good
And it’s gon be right
I’m getting rid of the shit i don’t want
Packing a bottle and sealing it up
Send it to sea
And telling a genie
Take it away
Aye
Putting all my flaws in a bottle
Putting all my hate in it too
(i love you)
Way too many days that’s been malo
Way too many days
I been tryna live a good life
‘07 kanye good life
Wanna live a good life
I need that ‘07 kanye good life
Aye

But...
This shit hard, my nigga
We still scarred, my nigga
Came a long way from the boulevard
Now they treat us like superstars my nigga
Might as well play the part
They already know who we are
So let me cop them gold thangs
Aye!
Diamonds dancing all up in my gold chain
20 karot nose rang
I do why i want cuz i got it
Do what i want cuz i’m poppin
Do what i want ain’t no options aye

& imma get on this tv momma
Imma
Imma put shit down
Imma flip this paper
Imma get that crown
Imma help my neighbor
Imma rep my town

Just tryna live a good life
An ‘07 kanye good life
Wanna live a good life
I need that ‘07 kanye good life

Putting all my pain in a bottle
Putting all my hate in it too
(i love you)
Way too many days that’s been malo
Way too many days
Just tryna live a good life
A ‘07 kanye good life
A good life
I need that ‘07 kanye good life
