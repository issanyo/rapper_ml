[Chorus:]
Girl you betta wear dat shit
Can't nobody wear like you
You betta walk dat shit
Can't nobody walk it like you do
Make it funky for me
Do dat shit that I

[Verse 1:]
I ain't with all of that talk let's get down to business
I found that spot like I lost it can I get a witness
You know just what I'm talking bout' I started off and you finished
I'm your sex bully you sweating bullets got you working on your fitness
All that noise you making you gon hurt somebody feelings
I hold the belt for that world record I'm working on my Guinness
That thing wet like a swimming pool and I'm bout' to dive in it
I'm Michael Phelps and you hot to death look at all the medals I'm winning
Girl you betta walk that shit
I ain't really gotta talk that shit
Cause by the end of the night you'll be doing shit that I like
Hell yea fucking right

[Chorus:]
Girl you betta wear dat shit
Can't nobody wear like you
You betta walk dat shit
Can't nobody walk it like you do
Make it funky for me

Do dat shit that I like
Do dat shit that I
Do dat shit that I like
You know what I'm talking bout'
The tongue with the thing and the stuff
Don't stop don't stop
Baby don't stop I can't get enough I'm bout it
Do dat shit
Do dat shit that I like
Do dat shit
Do dat shit that I like
You know what I'm talking bout'
The tongue with the thing and the stuff
Don't stop don't stop
Baby don't stop I can't get enough I'm bout it

[Verse 2:]
Uh, she got me dripping sweat on her booty
Uh, and now she got me more in to it
She keep looking back with that pretty face and she know I know what I'm doing
But she gon freak when she see them booty cheeks on this chick that I flew in
Uh, I think my second wind just blew in
Head up on that headboard I might give her a contusion
Be still, be still stop all of that moving
I'm the best you ever had and I'm bout' to prove it
I'm bout' to prove it
Umm you betta walk that shit
I ain't really gotta talk that shit
Cause by the end of the night you'll be doing shit that I like
Hell yea fucking right

[Chorus:]
Girl you betta wear dat shit
Can't nobody wear like you

Can't nobody walk it like you do
Make it funky for me
Do dat shit that I
Do dat shit that I like
Do dat shit that I
Do dat shit that I like
You know what I'm talking bout'
The tongue with the thing and the stuff
Don't stop don't stop
Baby don't stop I can't get enough I'm bout it
Do dat shit
Do dat shit that I like
Do dat shit
Do dat shit that I like
You know what I'm talking bout'
