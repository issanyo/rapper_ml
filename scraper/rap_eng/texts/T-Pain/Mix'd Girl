Hey... Yeah

[VERSE 1]
Hey, light skinned girl with the curly hair
Don't say you're from Delaware

Oh, I can't believe it
Ok, where your daddy from
Where your momma from
I need to meet dem
And tell your mom to come prove it
And I bet she can't do it
But I think I'm in love with all of your features
Can I get a hug, it was so nice to meet ya
You and all of your friends look so exotic
So you go get them and I'm gonna get my partners

[PRE-Chorus]
And We can make it a night to remember, I won't lie to ya baby
You're telling me you're Japanese and I tell you maybe
But you really got sex appeal, so I really gotta keep it real
Shorty, I want my fix, I put you on my list, I want you on my wrist cause

Now are you listening or do you even speak English
Oh, I can't believe it

So she's gonna get them and I'm gonna get my partners
