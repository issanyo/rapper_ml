[Verse 1]
Man, I got this gold all over me
So automatically she gonna twerk
Now I got these hoes all over me
She know that I be puttin' in work
Blowing up that soul and Hennessy
Spilling bad right now, trying to make it all work
Walk up in the fucking club like I'm Mr. Universe
Pop a rock, take a shot, and I'm lifting up her skirt
My pockets on infinity, you feeling me
Shorty get low in skinny jeans, let's go, get really deep
She coming at me til my voice get low like Billy Dean
[Yeah - silly me]
Every time she step the dance floor glow like Billie Jean
But I don't give a fuck right now cause I'm pretty stuck right now

[Bridge]
Man it look like she walking down a lonely highway
She's coming to a real nigga table
I'm coming at you real, no thicker
I'm gonna make her feel good
Shorty sweating over my way
Baby, I'm gonna keep it real
You gonna make me feel like
I just walked up in this spot with a drink in my cup
I got me a thot with a real big butt
I'm not gonna stop 'til I get enough
So shots on shots [on shots] on shots [on shots]
[shots shots shots shots shots shots shots shots]

[Hook]
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye

[Verse 2]
All I really need is one of me
Cause automatically I'm going first
Shorty got her team in front of me
She's tryna make me put in that work
I'm tryna keep my feet up under me
I'm pretty drunk right now, everything is in reverse
Pullin' out the iPhone, let me get the number first
I'll take you to my home, then I put her in a hearse
I be throwin' that beer redundantly
Suddenly I can really see she wantin' me
I can't believe she thought I was KD the way I leave and dunk on it
Now she stuck on it
She said, "it's all free, baby you can keep your money, G."
Cause she don't give a fuck right now
She walking to my truck right now

[Bridge]
Man it look like she walking down a lonely highway
She's coming to a real nigga table
I'm coming at you real, no thicker
I'm gonna make her feel good
Shorty sweating over my way
Baby, I'm gonna keep it real
You gonna make me feel like
I just walked up in this spot with a drink up in my cup
I got me a thot with a real big butt
I'm not gonna stop 'til I get enough
So shots on shots [on shots] on shots [on shots]
[shots shots shots shots shots shots shots shots]

[Hook]
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
Tear the roof off the mothafucker
Light the roof on fye
