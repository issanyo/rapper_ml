[Intro]
(Ayy, come on)
Snap yo fingers, do yo step
You can do it all by yourself
Let me see you do (woo)
Spotify, baby

[Verse 1]
Baby girl, what's your name?
Let me talk to you, let me buy you a drink
I'm not T-Pain, but you know me
Konvict Muzic, Nappy Boy, ooh wee
I know the club close at 3
What's the chances of you rolling with me?
Back to the crib, show you how I live
Let's get drunk forget what we did

[Hook]
I'ma buy you a drank
And I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think bout that? (I'll be in the grey Cadillac)
We in the bed like (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
We in the bed like (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Let me buy a drank
I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think bout that? (I'll be in the grey Cadillac)

[Verse 2]
Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I talk that
Crunk juice bombs, Oakley shades
Shawty got class, oh behave
Let's get gone, walk it out (walk it out)
Like that, that's what I'm talkin' 'bout
We gon' have fun, you gon' see
On that patron you should get like me

[Hook]
I'ma buy you a drank
And I'ma take you home with me
Got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think bout that? (I'll be in the grey Cadillac)
We in the bed like (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
We in the bed like (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Let me buy a drank
And I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think bout that? (I'll be in the grey Cadillac)
We in the bed like

[Bridge]
Now, walk it out
Now, walk it out
Now, walk it out

[Hook]
And I'ma buy you a drank
And I'ma take you home with me
Got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think bout that? (I'll be in the grey Cadillac)
We in the bed like (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Oh, we in the bed like (ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh)
Let me buy a drank
And I'ma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty, what you think bout that? (I'll be in the grey Cadillac)
We in the bed like, oh
