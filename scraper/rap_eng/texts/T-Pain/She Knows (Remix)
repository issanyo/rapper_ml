[Verse 1: The-Dream]
What's up with that rabbit? What's up with that rabbit?
She good well if she good with that ass all over my carrot
Took her straight to Paris, puss before the karat
Soon as I pull it down, I swear they wanna get married
Damn, goddamn, I swear these girls goddamn
Damn, damn, I swear my niggas go ham
First they start off bougie, then I'm like "Is that yo booty?"
Then she let me touch her, now we fucking

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
She knows, I been waiting just to take her down
I told my partner Ne-Yo hit me when she come around
And I'mma tear that body up
Anytime she walk in, she tear the party up
Time and time time again, any city, any club
She know what's up, she know she dope
Body like drugs, and I need another dose
Baby putting on a show
No matter how much she do I want some more
She got class with that ass when she hit the floor
She knows, oh yeah that's for sure

[Pre-Chorus 1: Trey Songz]
She loves the attention
That she get when she moves
Showin' out with her home girls
And she got me watching too cause

[Chorus: Trey Songz]
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
She knows
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
(She knows, she knows, she knows)
Oh she knows

[Verse 3: Ne-Yo]
From the front to the back
From her head to her toe
Why she do it like that?
Cause she knows, she knows
She aware that I'm watching
So she gon' put on a show
She look back and then she drop it
Cause she knows, she knows
Now check me out, she know a boss when she see one
She know one cause she be one
I watch her work it, and then watch it again like a re-run
Trouble maker, she one, bring that thang to me hun
Look at my no label it's time for us to be leaving
And it really don't matter where we going
She be the center of attention with the way that she throw it
All this money I'm blowing don't matter cause I got more
And she can have every single dollar and she know

[Pre-Chorus 2: Ne-Yo]
And she loves the attention
That she get when she moves, yeah
Showin' out with her home girls
Hypnotizing all the dudes, oh

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
