[Intro: Mariah Carey (Danja)]
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey (Danja!)
Keep it movin' bounce, hey (T-Pain)
Keep it movin' bounce, hey (MC)

[Verse 1: Mariah Carey]
Once again, nothin' jumpin' up in your place
Sick of your Berry buzzin' all in my face
Way too much to tolerate
Time to roll, y'all know I gots to migrate
Speed-dial connecting me to Rae Rae, hey
Click in Shawntae and Mae Mae, hey
"Treat it as a holiday," 'cause he's a wrap
Y'all know I had to migrate

[Pre-Hook: Mariah Carey]
See, I'm on my way home
'Cause my jeans, yeah, they fit, but it might benefit
Me to throw somethin' on
To feature my hips, accentuate my shit
And steal the show

[Chorus: Marian Carey]
Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off that Patrón
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If your neck and your wrist coordinate
Hair braided or faded OK...
We can move this back to my place
It's time to migrate

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
From my car into the club, we migrate
From the bar to VIP, we migrate
From the party to the after party, migrate
After party to hotel, migrate

[Verse 2: Mariah Carey]
As we proceed getting buzzed the envious ones
Hatin' but they can't take their eyes off us
But we don't see none of that
They playin' my jam and the floor is packed
See ya'll need to migrate up out the door
We're clinkin' glasses, compliments of the club
We raise their status, so you know they show us love
Everywhere we go they gon' flock
Them boys migrate to where it's hot

[Chorus: Marian Carey]
Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off that Patrón
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If you're inked up thuggin' that swag I like
Face, body and Lamborghini outside
Obviously boy you qualify
Otherwise migrate, bye

[Post-Chorus: Mariah Carey]
From my car into the club, we migrate
From the bar to VIP, we migrate
From the party to the after party, migrate
After party to hotel, migrate

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
This is where it begins and ends at the very same time
Teddy Pain, the main man of the hour
Got a flow that'll flex your tire
Got stacks, plus I'm back with Mariah
We stay down like four flats on a Cadillac
Back to the back, we fall flat, girl
If you feel like doing a dance
I'm gonna pull up my pants c'mon back, girl
But I gotta migrate to bar, from the bar to the floor
From the floor to the car, from the car to the crib
Then back to the club, we can migrate it all night
And mini coupe sitting on dubs
Whatcha waitin' on? I can't stand in one place
I'm on a Platinum Patrón and I hate when I don't get it my way
So don't wait for me to buy drinks or you gon' dehydrate
It's time to migrate

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Soon as I walk through the door
They know I'm from the 8-5-0
I need three bottles of that Patrón
I can make the Chevrolet grease up slow
If your ass and your tittes coordinate
Shawty show it like it ain't OK
We can move this back to my place
Shawty best believe, it's time to migrate

[Chorus: Mariah Carey]
Soon as we walk through the door
Fellas be grabbin' at us like "yo"
Tryin' to get us goin' off the Patrón... slow
We sippin' Grigio, slow
If you're inked up thuggin' that swag I like
Face, body and Lamborghini outside
Obviously, boy, you qualify
Otherwise migrate... bye

[Outro: Mariah Carey]
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
Keep it movin' bounce, hey
