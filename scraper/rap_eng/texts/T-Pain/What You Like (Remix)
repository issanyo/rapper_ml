[Intro: 24hrs]
24hrs and you know it's Hit-Boy
24 hits, Twenty with your bitch

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I wouldn't mind if you stay the night
Send your first and last name for the flight
Don't confuse me with all the hype
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
On the Instagram I see all the likes
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Shawty from the A, she in L.A
She say, "Twenty where the fuck we finna stay?"
Told her, "Baby, got the condo by the Staples"
I told her I'll pick her up if she ain't able
She said, "Twenty, I got friends out here"
I told her I'll send an Uber if they near
She said, "Bein' with a broke boy is my fear"
I told her, "Baby get the fuck up out of here"
Getting money every day, what I strive
Got a bad bitch that stay in LA Live
Baby, you should finish up your task
Me and Hit in the Wraith driving fast

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I wouldn't mind if you stay the night
Send your first and last name for the flight
Don't confuse me with all the hype
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
On the Instagram I see all the likes
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Shawty with the Pain, she throw up the gang
She know how to hang tight
She don't make me wait, she don't hesitate
She know that shit ain't right
Darkskin, all day at the park, skin
Baby, you just too light
Falling in to a deep sleep is the only thing that you should fight
Girl, that's what I like (girl, that's what I like)
Just get off the plane and the Wraith is already outside (already outside)
She suckin' that dick on the highway, girl, it's hard to drive (girl, it's hard to drive)
You gon' have to stop all that suckin' if we gon' survive (if we gon' survive)
We gon' survive
Ooh, ooh
And we gon' get right into it
Ooh, ooh
It's gon' take us all night to do it
Ooh, ooh
And I miss my lightskin broad
She should be home, just giving me dome
But I ain't gon' wait that long 'cause

[Chorus: 24hrs]
I wouldn't mind if you stay the night
Send your first and last name for the flight
Don't confuse me with all the hype
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
On the Instagram I see all the likes
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
I'm your type, I know that this is what you like
