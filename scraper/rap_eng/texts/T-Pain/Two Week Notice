But now I'm up in this bitch

This is my two week notice

Look for somebody else (oh, look for somebody else)

My position is open
And this ain't working out for me
'Cause all it's turning out to be

Hey

[Bridge]
I know you 'member the Christmas party
Party party we went all night long
You was so lit doing party tricks
Shaking that booty to all the songs
I know we work here together
But Girl, I been wanting you all alone
It's my chance chance chance chance
I got you in a room all alone
I got plenty memories
But then this Hennesy
It's making me think I should kiss you
So we 'bout to quit this shit anyway
So HR ain't even an issue
I just want to wake up to you
Not a day goes by that I don't
Girl, I take care of you, I swear to you
I get you anything that you want
Girl, I had it burking (burking) burking
Up against your hips (You better believe it, Baby)
And you goin' be squirming, slurping, squirting (oh yeah)

[Chorus]
So Mr. manager
This is my two week notice
I'm outta here
Look for somebody else (oh, look for somebody else)
So Mr. manager
This is my two week notice
My position is open
And this ain't working out for me
'Cause all it's turning out to be

[Post-Chorus]
Is me
Working (working) working (working)
All on the late-night shift
(Eh eh eh eh eh eh)
She tryna be in the club twerking (twerking)
Twerking (twerking) twerking (twerking)
