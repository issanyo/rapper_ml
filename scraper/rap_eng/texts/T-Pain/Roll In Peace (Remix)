[Intro: T-Pain]
(Yeah, boop! Yeah, boop!)
If we gon' be Florida niggas, let's be Florida these days, know what I'm talkin' about?
(yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We all roll together nigga

[Chorus 1: T-Pain]
You can't kill me, nigga, I swear that I've been died before (bitch)
God told me that I was gon' be here back in '94 (bitch)
Chevrolet got that motor (bitch) Diamonds all on my molars (bitch)
Parking lot, I lift the door up (bitch) Got your bitch snortin' Coca-Cola (bitch, bitch, bitch)
I can't even roll in peace (why?), all my cars orange and green
I can't even go to sleep (why?), your bitch keep blowin' me (yah)
I rep that shit from the 850 down to the Florida Keys (yah)
Set my nigga Kodak free (why?), that ain't where he supposed to be (oh yeah)
Niggas must wanna bleed (ooh), they don't wanna play my beat (ooh)
Niggas ain't rats where I'm from (why?) so they don't fuck with my cheese (nah)
Every Florida nigga coming up, that is that shit that I like to see (oh yeah)
Every Florida nigga saying that they the only Florida nigga
That shit don't sound right to me (nah), my niggas gon' blast for me (yeah)

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
If you talk that blasphemy (yeah) blastin' a fuck nigga head off (woah)
That shit is a blast for me (yeah), so why you ain't show me?
All the pussy niggas talking shit that don't know me
Before me and Kodak roll through slowly
Holding a .44 ting at 4 in the morning (ooh)
I'm about to switch my hoe up (why?)
'Cause everyone morning she starting to throw up
Gotta hit a lick, can't mess up (why?)
I know she 'boutta run my check up (ohh)
I'm her baby papi (ohh)
I'm her baby daddy (ohh)
She in love with a Florida nigga, she don't wanna leave Tallahassee

[Chorus 1: T-Pain]
You can't kill me, nigga, I swear that I've been died before (bitch)
God told me that I was gon' be here back in '94 (bitch)
Chevrolet got that motor (bitch)
Diamonds all on my molars (bitch)
Parking lot, I lift the door up (bitch)
Got your bitch snortin' Coca-Cola (bitch, bitch, bitch)
I can't even roll in peace (why?), all my cars orange and green
I can't even go to sleep (why?), your bitch keep blowin' me (yah)
I rep that shit from the 850 down to the Florida Keys (yah)
Set my nigga Kodak free (why?), that ain't where he supposed to be (oh yeah)
Niggas must wanna bleed (ooh), they don't wanna play my beat (ooh)
Niggas ain't rats where I'm from (why?) so they don't fuck with my cheese (nah)
Every Florida nigga coming up, that is that shit that I like to see (oh yeah)
Every Florida nigga saying that they the only Florida nigga
That shit don't sound right to me (nah), my niggas gon' blast for me (yeah)

[Chorus 2: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see
That you ain't gon ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got me for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You said that you gon' ride for me

[Verse 2: Kodak Black]
Baby, that's blasphemy, yeah
Baby, you're bad for me, yeah
Say you gon' clap for me, yeah
Say you gon' blast for me, yeah
Why you ain't show me none of the love you say you have for me, yeah
I was goin' through tragedy
Bitch, I needed you drastically, yeah
I'ma just switch my flow up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no throw up, yeah
Maybe I'm sick, no check up, yeah
Boy, you need to run your check up, yeah
I'm eatin' on you niggas, no ketchup, yeah
I'm eatin' on you niggas, can't catch up, ayy
Hit her face down with her ass up, ayy
Even when I'm fucking, I'm masked up, ayy

[Pre-Chorus: Kodak Black]
You ain't the one for me, baby
You ain't got shit I need, bitch
You want me to take my time with you
Well maybe I'm not your speed bitch
Maybe I'm out your league, bitch
You ain't even got no cheese, bitch
Maybe I'm just too G for you
Or maybe I'm just too street, bitch

[Chorus 2: Kodak Black]
I can't even roll in peace (why)
Everybody notice me (yeah)
I can't even go to sleep (why)
I'm rolling on a bean (yeah)
They tried to give me eight
Got on my knees like "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus
Why you got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave, but you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind can see (what)
That you ain't gon ride for me
You ain't even showing me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
And you say that you gon’ ride with me

[Verse 3: XXXTENTACION]
I ain’t gon' do the nigga shit 'cause I’m too good for features, huh
I ain’t gon’ fuck the nigga bitch 'cause I know she a eater, ayy
Last time I wifed a bitch she told the world I beat her, huh
And when they locked Lil Kodak up, my nigga I couldn’t believe it, huh
Ayy lil' shawty, pop my whoadie
Pockets on Pinocchio, poking yuh
Hit her from the back, damn that bitch bleeding
Said I knocked her period on
Remember when I had that poker, huh
Instead of looking over my shoulder, huh
Forcing with a nigga, no Yoda, huh
That mean a young nigga got what on me? (ayy)
