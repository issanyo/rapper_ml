Do your thang Shawty
Do what you wanna do
You can dance like this
Nobody lookin at you

(Let's Go, Let's Go)

I feel like i can fly high as a kite
If I can fly high as a kite then i'm gone (I'm gone, I'm gone)
I feel like i can fly high as a bird
If I fly high as a bird i'm flying home

But first you gotta
Freeze, then pose
Freeze, then pose
...

[Chrous]
Take your clothes off
Get naked on the Dancefloor (The Dancefloor)
Take your shoes off
So you can come and dance some more (Dance some more)

I want you to do it
Do it

Nobody lookin at you, (Nobody lookin at you)

I feel like i can fix my own car
If i can fix my own car
Then im outta here (I'm gone, I'm gone)

I feel like i can fly like a Plane
If i can fly like a Plane i'm flying you near

But first you gotta
Freeze, then pose
Freeze, then pose
