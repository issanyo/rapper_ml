[Intro]
Oh no, don’t you quit
Let another nigga see what you working with (x3)
You fly, you be on your Birkin shit
You make me wanna hurt you when you twerk that shit

[Verse 1]
Girl, make me wanna post up pics
Facebook, let me poke you
Put that booty on Instagram
20 more pics, going insta-H.A.M
I got money, you got friends
You think you bad, match me then
Hop in that Bugatti, tell them muthafuckin' coppers
"Come and catch me" then, catch me then
You be working all day
You deserve a place to get ratchet in (you ratchet!)
I’m the shit, somebody bring me the laxative
Me and my niggas go hard
And you just Tough Actin' Tinactin

[Pre-Hook]
That’s that shit, keep doing that
Lemme put my hands on it, pat, pat, pat
Get it popping, crack a leg
Money on you, on ya titties
Racks on racks

[Hook] (x2)
Oh no, don’t you quit
Let them, let them see what you working with
Girl swear to god I’ma hurt that shit
Do a good job, baby, work that dick

[Bridge] (x2)
Money in the air, money everywhere
Go and pop that pussy how I like
I don’t wanna waste your time
Don’t be wasting mine, right now
Baby, it’s about to go, go, go, go, go, go down
Ehe, he, he

[Verse 2]
You make me wanna take a video, video
You ready for Teddy Pain, here we go, here we go
Lay down, lay down, stay down, stay down
Okay now, fo' sho'
Grab them pillows, bite them covers
Me and my homies lay pipe, Mario brothers
Follow me, I got a mamacita
Drinking margaritas out my Louboutins
We go to papi on the molly
And in three nights, we gon' run two by ten
So bring six of them bitches that you hang with
And I’ma bring two of my friends
Girl that ass so fat, from the back
It look like you got on two Depends

[Pre-Hook + Hook]

[Bridge] (x2)
Money in the air, money everywhere
Go and pop that pussy how I like
I don’t wanna waste your time
Don’t be wasting mine, right now
Baby, it’s about to go, go, go, go, go, go down
Ehe, he, he
