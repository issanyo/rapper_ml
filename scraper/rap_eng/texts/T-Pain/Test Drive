[Verse]
Now I done got a lil older, flow got colder
Baby I'm rich put ya head on my shoulder
So before ya come to the crib
I'm a take you to the mode and give you a one sover (Feel good don't it?)
I'm a put you on it
You ain't never gonna get off, get off, get off (Bout that hood honey)
Gotta take you for a test drive
Come on take that shit off, shit off, shit off

[Chorus]
And I bet that you the best right
I'm about to take you for a test drive
Hey, show me what'cha head rest like
I'm about to take you for a test drive
Hey, highbeams on ya headlights
I'm about to take you for a test drive, baby
Hey, making love at the red light
I'm about to take you for a test drive

[Outro]
Test drive, test drive, test drive, test drive, test drive
I'm about to take you for a test drive
Test drive, test drive, test drive, test drive, test drive
I'm about to take you for a test drive
