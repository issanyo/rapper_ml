Brand new rims, brand new Chevrolet
And a bitch yellow, red, blue
So nigga I ain't ever-scared-of you
Somebody better tell these niggas how I do
And if it ever come to it, I'm a run straight through it
I'm a ready nigga if you really need help
Everybody in the street saying he feeling himself
But I'm saving they world
And I can only save one person at a time
So I'm saving they girl
And I'm a make her fly, baby wave hi
All up in the truck, now Baby wave bye
Or we can go and get some of your friends in the band

Walked up to a nigga on some villan shit
But I'm way to fly so I can't be beat
So I gave her the super meat cause I'm superman
