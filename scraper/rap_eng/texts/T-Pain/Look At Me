All that ass girl you gotta give me something

Winter time working out for the summer
With a face that look like it just came from heaven
You ain't post nothing in a minute
I need to see you, baby you got fifteen seconds

Snapping, snapping, snapping, snapping
And all I said is damn
You ain't said a word you just looking at the screen

Let me see, and you're only twenty-three
