The way she talks to me, she talks to me
I don't know what I'd do without it
Love like this can last for a lifetime
And I don't wanna see the stress no more

Girl I wanna be your shinin' knight
And I wanna see ya shinin' bright
Girl, all go through the tests
Just to get to know you, know you
And you know I'd be there till the end
'Cause you're more than just a friend, ya know

No matter what you say, no matter what you do
I'll always be there for you baby 'cause you're my boo
No matter near or far, you're always in my heart
I'll never let you go 'cause you will always be my natural
Hi-hi-hi-hi-high

Girl you ain't got to be super model lady
You gon' be my baby regardless
Don't need nobody else around, I'm good
'Cause girl I got you now, shawty you're a perfect
And you deserve it
And you ain't gotta worry about me hurting you

Show you, show you, show you
Girl I'm in this till the end
'Cause you're more than just a friend, ya know
