[Intro: T-Pain]
Uh
Pizzle!
Oh, Val Jones hit it

I'm a be getting on the song you okay with this one, ha ha

Coming to the stage is a motherfucka cold as the South Pole

Known as the sellout, rocking them sold out shows
Born rich in the brain

He never stick to the same, ol' same ol'
Have a nigga leanin' and rockin' like he was Fabo (OH)
But now the case close
Ain't no one-hit wonder here, mu'fucker, the first 48 gone

Somebody pass me the queso dip

Propane when I step in the mic booth
Crew clean like a white suit in a white coupe
When you look in the mirror, it don't like you
And Imma keep it on the low: 5'2"

[Hook x4]
Buddy you're a boy make a big noise
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day, you got
