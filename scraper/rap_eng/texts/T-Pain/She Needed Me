[Verse 1]
I still don't know what she put in my mind
But I want it gone
Immediately
She makes me think I need her all the time
Oh baby no
She needed me

[Pre-Chorus]
The rules don't apply to her (ooh)
I knew I was blind to her and all she's done to me
The rules don't apply to her (oh-oh)
She makes me think I need her all the time
Oh baby no

[Chorus]
She needed me
(hey, hey)
I need her all the time
Oh baby no
She needed me
(hey, hey)
I need her all the time
Oh baby no
She needed me

[Verse 2]
Me and you are so through I can't go on
I want you gone
I'm believing in me
(hey)
She makes me feel like I did something to her so wrong
Oh baby no
You cheated me

[Pre-Chorus]
You know the dudes always fly to her
(oh)
I knew I was blind to her and all she's done to me
The rules don't apply to her
(oh)
She makes me think I need her all the time
Oh baby no

[Chorus]
She needed me
(hey, hey)
I need her all the time
Oh baby no
She needed me
(hey, hey)
I need her all the time
Oh baby no
She needed me

[Bridge]
Who would've thought that I would have to get rid of you like I did
It's hurting me but it ain't hurt you (you, you, you)
But I know you're not worth it (worth it)
I know you don't deserve anything I got
Yeah
So come on baby let me help you pick up all your clothes
And come on baby let me help you get outta my door
'Cause she makes me think I need her in my life
Oh baby no

[Chorus]
She needed me
(hey, hey)
I need her all the time
Oh baby no
She needed me
(hey, hey)
I need her all the time
Oh baby no
She needed me
