(remix)
Give 'em a little, 12 Play
Its time for love yo, 12 play
Just give 'em a little
Kell, Kell re re Chopped (screwed)

Tell me have you ever met a girl that acted like that was her real hair
When it's not?, not?, not?
Ever ran into a chick that said that she was mixed with something else?
And you're like, please stop, stop, stop
But she looking so right, and her body so tight
Got you at the bar drinking, buying her drinks all night
Clubs 'bout to let out and now you're drunk
Now she leaving the club with me, sorry you've been punked
Believe me I know, listen to the remix professor
See homie before you tip her, first you must undress her
Cause this is how a real playa do
Tell me, do I have to sound like a broken record record record record

Chorus
Now you've officially been chopped & screwed
Screwed, screwed, chopped, chopped & screwed
You've officially been (and, and) screwed
And ooh ooh chopped, screwed, screwed
You've officially been chopped & screwed..

Reeemixx
Now now can I break it down and show ya
Break it down and show ya
Just how easy it is to be chopped and screwed?

1...You're in the club, she walks by
2...She give you those bedroom eyes
3...You think tonight she's gonna fulfill you're fantasies..yea
4...Now you're both all on the floor
5...And you're feeling all on her thighs
6...Now the club is about to let out and you're like what you doing after this...yea
7...She suggests the IHOP
8,8,8... and Now you're putting her all in ya car
Stupid 9...You think you're gonna get some Bump & Grind...yea
10..oh, now she wanna bring her friends
11...Now the bill is up to 210
12..Goofy, You give her your number,says shes gonna call but you never see her again

(Chorus)

Calm it down now, calm it down now
Calm it down now, calm it down now
Cause that was a freestyle, cause that was a freestyle
That was a freestyle, that was a freestyle
Now, just imagine if I had to sat my ass down and
Took my time and really wrote it (wrote it) Oh
