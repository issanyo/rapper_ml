[Verse]
How did my money go my cash I don't know
I crash with bad times I'm run in bad luck
I'm down to my last 3 dollars and nobody wanna holla when you sitting on the bottom
I need new shoes and my baby need bottles
Anything for that change I be out here for a throttle
Riding and broke and tryin' to come up on this game
It's over the love of the green I be bosted on the scroll with them dough finge late night
Fried jay Glock super hot like a bench pipe
I tried to turn the other cheek but they gon' kick me on my creek if I laid another week
So I picked up the phone and called the dope man and tell them that I need my supply
So I can get back to what I used to I got a hole in my pocket like a fruit loop

[Hook]
There's a hole in my pocket where my money should go
There's only 25 cent of a hundred I know
And I had so much money before
But now there's a hole in my pocket where my money should go

[Bridge]
Sang it with me there was a hole in the ground
The most troubling hole that you ever seen
But I had so much money before
There's a hole in my pocket where my money should go

[Verse]
Here I roam for one more
Sometimes I feel like I'ma never get apart from broke
And keep a job so back to the streets to go
Worry about the rent tryin' to get up out this hole
I'm tired of living this life so this time I got my mind made up
No more bullshit and time to man up
I'm tryin' to have a better life
Big nice house for the kids and the wife
And get my mama that benz and get my sister that jag
And get my brother that donk and get my daddy that lamb
'Cause I'm tired of being broke tired of living hard
Tired of worrying about gas money for the car
Sometimes I wanna let go but I got a gang control
And get a grip and never let go
Straight forward it's time it's time to get dough
It's a hole in my pocket where my money should go

[Hook]

[Verse]
9 to 5 just went to hell
Every cousin I got is in jail
I know, (I know) I gotta do better (I gotta do better)
Time to get off my ass, get this money but not too fast
'Cause I know that it's so possible to burn a hole in my

[Hook]
