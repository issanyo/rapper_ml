[Intro]

Uhh
Damn man
Ay I don't think I'm ever gon leave here Bruh...
Let me get at you real quick lil mama let me holla at you
Let me tell you something
Just a lil some some

[Verse 1]

Girl that ass look thick...
Tryna figure out a way that I can smash this chick
Cuz she bounce it everywhere, she needa bring it all to me
She said Simon says no but baby what does Paula see?
Cuz I know what randy do; & he thinkin you a yes
Tryna get to Hollywood come take a ride up on this jet
This is more than just some sex, this my first time In a club
Throwin Money everywhere, cuz I'm catchin feels, I'm in love

[Hook]

She poppin she rollin she rollin
She climbin that pole and
I'm N Luv with a stripper
She trippin she playin she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl I'm stayin
I'm N Luv with a stripper

[Verse 2]

Barely legal this is fuckin crazy...
She said how you finna love me when you just a baby?
Say I'm 18... She say she double that
Throw another rack in hopes that maybe she would love me back
But, she start talkin bout her life and how she got here
& how she in league that I'm just Not near...
Now a fuckin stripper out here ruinin my self esteem
Walked in feelin icy can't believe I let her melt my bling

[Hook]

She poppin she rollin she rollin
She climbin that pole and
I'm N Luv with a stripper
She trippin she playin she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl I'm stayin
I'm N Luv with a stripper

[Verse 3]

Took a L but still feel like a G
Cuz she still twerking on me...
Swear that booty got a curse & it's been workin on me
4 am and all my homies been deserted on me
Tryna see how Imma make it home
All my cash went to that ass & tryna get some dome
Now I'm slumped out on this couch & go to check my phone
See my girl texted me... Damn... Fuck it...

[Hook]

She poppin she rollin she rollin
She climbin that pole and
I'm N Luv with a stripper
She trippin she playin she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl I'm stayin
I'm N Luv with a stripper
