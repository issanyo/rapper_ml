[Verse 1: T-Pain (Polow Da Don)]
I know I'm turnin you on
Chocolate skin poppin I'm so hated on
And I won't let a bitch stop me
My Chevrolet never hesitate to cause ruckess
Because I got that b-b-bass in that muthafucka
I got big shit poppin, look how my truck ride
The Louis V belt with the Louis jump drive
The Louis V shoes with with the scarf with it
And the Oakley shades go so hard with it
Ayy, I know I'm turnin you on
Nappy Boy digital got you burnin my songs on
Cause I'm dressed to impressed, the best dressed of the night
Nappy time the next slick niggas got me fresh lookin right
Take a step to me, right and I get my swagger up
Now I'm (Mick Jagger), slash chains -saw massacre
Cause I'm on this road, like a (Rolling Stone)
And I kill every show til they know that I'm gone
I got my chain, watch, my braclet, grill
Top hat leanin let you know that I'm real (you know I'm real shawty)
Ain't no tellin' why I take muhfuckas make the whole crowd say
(Wait a minute...) motha fucka you turnin me off

[Chorus: Keri Hilson {Polow Da Don}]
(Aaahhh) {REMIX!}
You ever try to get that close to me {KERI HILSON!}
You better come correct how you 'proachin me
Dime divas give it to me
(Aaahhh)

[Bridge: Keri Hilson]
I shot the sheriff
But wait til I shoot these bitches, down down
Shoot these bitches, down down
Ms. Keri baby

[Verse 2: Keri Hilson]
I ain't tryin to start some mess
There's just somethin on my chest that I need to get off
Cause you turnin me off
Your vision cloudy if you think that you're the best
You can dance she can sing but she need to move it to the... (don't do it em)
She need to go have some babies
She needs to sit down, she fake
Them other chicks ain't even worth my time to talk about
Been had dollars boy
Go-on get your money up
Know you're ain't the only homie on melined up
I ain't turnin it off
I'm stay turnin it on
Go-on and tell these folks how long I been writing your songs
I been puttin you on, just check the credits ho
And if you want me you can find me in the Decatur ho
Cause you're turnin me off

[Chorus:]
(Aaahhh)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin me
Dime divas give it to me
(Aaahhh)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin me
Dime divas give it to me

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
I'm high as hell, swagger right, float like after life
I got a gorilla appetite, I make you wife my snack at night
Why you still white like aphrodite, Da Lambo blue, da lambo nice
Da Lambo bad, da lambo bright
And the cops can kiss my lambo lights - I'm gone
I know, I turn you on
She fell in love with an alien
Now give me my space cause that's my home my now sit on my face like its your thong
I'm nasty yeah I know
I'm nasty like no other, make her say you can get it mothafucka (oh)
I burn you all like a candle
Fire flow, better not wear sandles
Hey Keri, I'm a bedroom vandel
Run up in your room and make you drop that flannel
I'm just playin' boo, I hope I didn't offend you
But Turn you up and on is what a man do
And I'm the man, it ain't no secret baby
And, this is the remix baby!

[Chorus:]
(Aaahhh)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin me
Dime divas give it to me
(Aaahhh)
You ever try to get that close to me
You better come correct how you 'proachin me
Dime divas give it to me
