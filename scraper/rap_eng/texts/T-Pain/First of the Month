[Intro: T-Pain]
I made a choice (woo!), I'm rolling with Royce (yeah yeah)
Ooh yeah, yeah (yeah, woo woo!)
Everything is everything but I need a better ring
I'm married to the game so I got both of us wedding rings
On every finger, T-Pizzle the wedding singer
We only make head bangers, I'm leavin' 'em dead and I ain't scared

[Chorus: Royce Da 5’9”]
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I was panickin' yesterday, now I'm happy as hell
We on (I just do what I do)
We on, yeah (I just do what I do)
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I'm turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never be alone (I just do what I do)
Be alone, yeah (I just do what I do)

[Verse 1: Royce Da 5’9”]
Said it's the first of the month, got bitches callin' my phone
Just paid a couple of bills, just got some shit cut back on
I gave my momma some money so she can go out and gamble
God only put on me, what he know that I can handle
But it's the first of the month, I'm puttin' some rims on my car
My lady said it's a waste, bullshit I'm a star
Leave me alone
She jealous anytime I'm gon' shine
She said, "If you so talented why, nobody ain't ever heard of ya?"
She dumps me on the 20th, takes me back by the 30th
She's wrong
But we been together such a long time

[Chorus: Royce Da 5’9”]
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I was panickin' yesterday, now I'm happy as hell
We on (I just do what I do)
We on, yeah (I just do what I do)
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I'm turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never be alone (I just do what I do)
Be alone, yeah (I just do what I do)

[Bridge: Chavis Chandler & T-Pain]
Ayyy, my life's like Heaven
That's from the first of the month until the seventh
And from the seventeenth to the end, it's like Heaven
We go from buying back to selling
Ayyy, I live like a king
By way of delivery of a mailman
Oh no, oh no

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
I'm tryna' be loyal to never going broke again
The money, the power, respect is my only three friends
So I put a ring on the game, I'ma put a chain on it later
Now I got the hang of the game, I'ma make it rain for ya baby
Now, I put the work in (I put the work in)
So if anybody asks about me, just tell 'em I'm workin' (tell 'em I'm workin')
If you not talkin' 'bout money then you get the "do not disturb" then (do not disturb)
Talk down on the game, get one of them nerves in
Uh, if I ever fucked up a friendship—I'm sorry (sorry)
Money don't buy happiness, I go and cry in a Ferrari (skrt)
We get kicked out the room, I'ma move the shit down to the lobby (yeah)
'Cause I got my bag in the mail, I'm happy as hell, bitch it's time to party
And it's the first of the month

[Chorus: Royce Da 5’9”]
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I was panickin' yesterday, now I'm happy as hell
We on (I just do what I do)
We on, yeah (I just do what I do)
It's the first of the month, I got my bag in the mail
I'm turnin' back up my radio
I hope I never be alone (I just do what I do)
Be alone, yeah (I just do what I do)

[Outro: Chavis Chandler]
Ayyy, my life's like Heaven
That's from the first of the month until the seventh
And from the seventeenth to the end, it's like Heaven
We go from buying back to selling
Ayyy, I live like a king
By way of delivery of a mailman (I just do what I do)
And we on, yeah (I just do what I do)
It's the first of the month
So cash your checks and come on
It's the first of the month
So cash your checks and come on
It's the first of the month
So cash your checks and come on
It's the first of the month
So cash your checks and come on
