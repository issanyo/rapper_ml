[Intro: Kanye West, DJ Khaled & T-Pain]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
DJ Khaled, We The Best (Go hard!)
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I do it for the hood cause the hood told me I should (Go hard!)
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
If you rep your hood, and you goin' hard
If the they hatin' on you, don't stress
Tell them niggas that we the best (Go, go, go hard!)
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
Fuck nigga, you can't stop this!
Fuck the rest, we run this game
Kanye West, Khaled and Pain

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go - go hard!

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
I go the hardest, flow so retarded
I'm disgusted with myself, I mean, were do I start
First I spin around and vomit, then I shit up on it
Fuck the beat up so bad, won't nobody get up on it
I flow sick, nigga how sick, seasick
Got your hand out don't look at me bitch
You lookin' at who made me rich
You lookin' at who made me rich
I had some wins, some losses
Just a life of a God damn boss's
With the top off lookin' for a girl
With a ass as fat as Tracee Ross's
This is dope as it get
Dope as a motherfuckin' acid trip
Fly as fifty-seven passengers
This finna be another classic, bitch
Everybody know I got it, if you want it then get at it
But I ain't goin' have it, no, I ain't goin' have it

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go - go hard!

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
I ain't ever been scurred
Never been the type to bite my words
When I came up y'all gave me shit
Now I'm finna make y'all eat them turds
Always said what the fuck I felt
Go head spit that murder I wrote
Man I don't care bout what you felt
Fuck you nigga I know I'm dope
Felt like I'm comin' to get my all
Felt like I had to play the fly on the wall
Felt like niggas was stuntin' on me
Funny how I'm flyer than them all
Now I'm at the top ain't nowhere to go now
Instead of me, she goin' go down
Maybe I would have slowed down
If I knew what I know now
I'm stupid, yeah I know I'm dumb
This could fuckin get old, well it's good I'm young
Before my heart get cold as the hood I'm from
Tell me what it take to be number one
I guess it's goin' be what it's goin' be
But here's one thing y'all got to hear
I'mma tell you like George Bush told me
Fuck ya'll niggas, I'm out of here

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go - go hard!

[Outro: Kanye West & DJ Khaled]
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I go hard for the hood, I go hard for the streets
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
I go hard for the ghetto
Kanye West, T-Pain, DJ Khaled
I think it's time for me to go hard as the hood I'm from, ayy
We The Best, we won't stop
We can't stop, "We Global!"

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, if you could you would get rid of me
What you gonna do when a nigga got to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me
You should already figure I'mma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another nigga step in yo' yard
Makin' money ain't shit to me
This in my veins and it gets to my heart
So I am, I will, I gots to go
You got another way to live, I gots to go hard
I am gettin' it in until the end
I got to go, go, go, go - go hard!
