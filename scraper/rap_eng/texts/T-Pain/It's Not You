Its not you
Oh youu
Its not youu
Oh oh

All up in these clubs
Playing with these girls
Traveling around the world
I know ill be
Messing with your feeling
Money to the ceilings
It falls down to the floor
I know ill be
This club this club is pumping like a champ
An music got me ham
Im canceling france

Messing myself
An thats all that i do
So if we break up
I can tell you its not you
Its not you its not you
Not you its me
I know i've been tripping
I need you to listening
Its not you its not you

I know im messing up
I can't stay out all in this club
I know we be
Kissing all in public
An girl i love it
An can't get enough of it
But girl lately
You been talking down
Keep me with a frown
I can't keep you around

This club this club is pumping like a pro
Girl you already know

Messing myself
You can't tell me what to do
So if we break up

That thing so stiff
Anything you made i can killa

More booty party like a roller
For show flood the club like new orleans

An i can't touchdown for doggin

Its not you its not you
Its not you its me
I know im messing up
I can't stay out all in this club
