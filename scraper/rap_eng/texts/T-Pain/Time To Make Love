And I know dat ur mumma don't trust me
And she hates when you tell her that you love me

You got my head spinnin like a whirlwind
Shorty, I no I made some mistakes but I can
Make it up by givin you this way and take it I know
It int no need to push and shuv
Hold and grab
The man above let us kiss n hug
Coz baby..

[Chorus x2]
