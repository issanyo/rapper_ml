[Verse 1]
I've been a man ever since I can remember
I've never been a big fan of December
The nights get cold
Nobody there to take care of me
Nobody there to tell me that they love me
And nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But we were born and raised in the days
Where you couldn't even pay to get away from the pain
And that's where we live, all day
And now we get paid to be slaves of our very own grave
And I say it every goddamn day, "That's no way to live"

[Chorus]
I've been called the murderer, killer
I've just played with the hand that they deal us
I've been called a loser, an outlaw
Shut down in my very own backyard
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never

[Verse 2]
What's your agenda, I never claimed that I wasn't a sinner
Bless my soul
I've been down for too many days
I might drown in all these haters out of control

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We were born and raised in the days
Where you couldn't even pay to get away from the pain
And that's where we live, permanently
But now we get paid to be slaves of our very own grave
And I say it every goddamn day, "That's no way to live"
No, not for me

[Chorus]
I've been called the murderer, killer
I've just played with the hand that they deal us
I've been called a loser, an outlaw
Shut down in my very own backyard
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never

[Bridge]
Who better to fix you other than you? ooh
You know exactly what you want, you know exactly what you gotta do
You just gotta do it, do it
You just gotta do it, do it

[Chorus]
I've been called the murderer, killer
I've just played with the hand that they deal us
I've been called a loser, an outlaw
Shut down in my very own backyard
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never
