[Intro] Whoa, oho, oho, whoa

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I got a feeling in my bones that I can't get rid off
But that's probably the base
Can't get this picture out my mind, that I've seen on Twitter
The one of your face
Girl I'm just trying to see, if you feel just a little like me
So DM me back, don't do me like that
I wanna see your pretty ass in person, girl
But that's just not the case
Plus I'm way on the other side of the earth
And girl plane tickets too hard for me to pay
I'm just trying to see, if you feel just a little like me
So you can give me a call
I ain't doing nothing at all

[Hook]
Girl you can tweet what you do
And posting pictures
And I feel like I need to be posted with you
Laid up in the bed somewhere, spilling make up, messing up your hair
Girl you keep making me spend my time
Checking on your timeline
You make me say whoa oho Yeah Yeah
I'm falling in love with your default picture

[Verse 2]
You don't ever show up in my mentions girl
Just say my name
Must be some wrong with my eyes of my iphone-drive
Or is this even your page?
I am just trying to see if you got any interests in me
Or am I bothering you?
Should I be unfollowing you?
And you be acting like that dude in your picture is your boyfriend...
But I know it's just a face
Let me show you that I am better than him
Just name a time and place
Girl you gotta see where he is, that is hould be
Girl you can give me a call
I just wanna have a talk that's all

[Hook]
Girl you can tweet what you do
And posting pictures
And I feel like I need to be posted with you
Laid up in the bed somewhere, spilling make up, messing up your hair
Girl you keep making me spend my time
Checking on your timeline
You make me say whoa oho Yeah Yeah
