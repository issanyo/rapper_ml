[Intro]
Whoo, This, Is, Is, Is
Who left the refrigerator open bitch
Hey uh hey

[Verse 1]
I'm back up in your shit just like a bounty hunter
Don't worry about your bitch, I know you counting on her
Mounting on her
Went up in the club and threw a thousand on her
Took her back to the crib and put the hounds on her
I ain't playing games with these niggas
Spitting fire spitting flames
On my ring got seven figures
I'ma rearrange things on these niggas
It's gon be a fucking change on these niggas
I'm like no way
Ok
They don't want T-Pain alive stay out that door way
I got the shit, I go and holler at my ho's hey
My bitch the plug so listen to what my hoe say, yeah
VVS's on the mustang with the top off of it
Party at the crib the whole block will love it
I don't give fuck if it's your mama homie
If I need a door kicked in I bet she knock it for me, oh

[Chorus]
That's how it goes
Put my hand on the bible nigga I done took the oath
Y'all niggas slow
Come and holla
I done moved about a hundred million dollars on the road, ho
All I wanna do is zoom a zoom past 12 on the road, ho
I bet them coppers won't stop me
Once they see what I got popping
Just know (ho)
Just know
Them coppers won't stop me
Once they see what I got popping
Just know

[Verse 2]
I call a BMW a rump shaker
That pump hit you
Jumpman, you a ballplayer
That suicide open
I got plenty more
[?]
Bitch you know me
I got Henny though
I ain't 'bout to entertain these fuck boys
They been talking that shit, they done made enough noise
Don't get it twisted
Don't get it twisted on the low
I've been trying to be that humble motherfucker
But I'm 'bout to let it go

[Chorus]
That's how it goes
Put my hand on the bible nigga I done took the oath
Y'all niggas slow
Come and holla
I done moved about a hundred million dollars on the road, ho
All I wanna do is zoom a zoom past 12 on the road
I bet them coppers won't stop me
Once they see what I got popping
Just know (ho)
Just know
Them copper won't stop me
Once they see what I got popping
Just know
