[Intro]
Here we go, come on
Uh, uh, uh. come on
Uh, uh, uh. come on

[Verse 1]
Somebody better slow me down
NappyBoy digital hold me down
Sure I look for that Popeye, now she has no choice but to blow me down
I'm hard at work
You pulling on the trees but they hardly jerk
And I'm too big in these streets to be fucking with a nigga smaller than a [?] shirt
Yeah, I'm on deck, so I got the nigga Dizm 'bout to come on next
Everybody put your hands up and come on, let's
Celebrate that a young nigga on that jet
And he own them whips
Got your lady in the front with something on her lips
"Come fuck me, Pain" is what that big black ass say
I gave her the black tip like an ashtray

[Hook]
What you need? see me out here on them city streets
Everybody keep on telling me that I ain't live
But I keep representin' for that 8-5-0
What you want? do you really want for me to up that [?]
[?] swish make that 26 jump
Everybody put your hands up and say hell yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Nigga what you need yeah yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 2]
Somebody better slow me down
Hopping from that chevy on that boat shit now
Woodgrain table drinking black label
Nigga put the motherfucking coaster down
I go overboard when i come to the game im the overlord
Old black ladies like oh my lawd
And bitches wanna lick me like a cold lip sore
So i gave her the chapstick
She just wanna suck on a rap dick
I called her down and when she gone down she sucked everything up like a napkin
So i put her on that bed, and she gave a nigga thathead
I gave her the see through deer de
She sucked on the glass like she was a crackhead

[Hook]
What you need? See me out here on them city streets
Everybody keep  telling me that I ain't live
But i keep representin' for that 8-5-0
What you want? Do you really want for me to up that [?]
[?] swish make that 26 jump
Everybody put your hands up and say hell yeah
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Nigga what you need yeah yeah yeah yeah
