[Hook: T-Pain]
Honey, we got off on the wrong foot, baby
Cause the relationship has been so good lately
If I don’t do what I do, then who’s gon put food on the table?
It is what it is, I’m just handling biz
But I do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live
I only do what I do so we can live

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Mama don’t work, heater don’t work
Police pulled me over and said he seen weed on my shirt
I pray to the lord and ask for forgiveness
If he popped my trunk I can get a life sentence
He came a little closer and told me that he smellin’ it
I said “I rolled one up, I won’t insult your intelligence
But I threw it out the window half a mile ago”
He asked me when the last time I smoke, I said a while ago
Forgive me officer, I’m stressin’ and my pockets sore
Hurtin’, chillin’ with my dog like a fuckin’ Labrador
He said he ain’t with the bull: matador
Looked at the top of my car, like what this ladder for?
I told him I was puttin’ goals up in the mornin’
And I’m goin’ to my uncle’s house to see if he can join me
The officer got a call so he was needed
And he told me slow it down, and I told him please believe it
Then I proceeded to go to my uncle’s house
Well it really wasn’t my uncle, it was a junkie’s house
He got a badass niece with a donkey now
Pullin’ out the parking lot, headed to the other spot
Out all night, at it with the addicts, causin’ Havoc, I’m a Prodigy
Niggas know we Mobbin’ Deep, gotta stay up when everyone fall asleep
The good die young, and promises are hard to keep
I left my old job, and now them niggas hardly speak
I got a new job, and plus I’m making more a week
The girl that I’m with is like a young Kimora Lee
I got them folks feenin’, pumpin’ that Jodeci
Sippin’ and my soda pink, you niggas is toilet seat
Check my resume, it used to say I sold quarter keys
Conduct disorderly, stayin’ in the trap house
Trips went to work, I’m so glad that it mapped out

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Simon says, monkey see monkey do
I wore the shirt, you wore the same shirt too
See me with my bitch, you buy your bitch the same purse
Shoot you and your nigga, y’all can share the same hearse
This that murder 1, mixed with the bubblegum
Kept working my dun dun duns, come get your mama some
Nigga, this that slum talk, some say we talks slums
I rarely finish the end of my words
Watch the rims hit on the curve
And what a nigga really care about a lisp?
People arguin’ over me while I’m layin’ in a bitch
Death to a snitch, get it while you can [break] and shit
Its 3:30 in the A.M
We’re just gettin’ started like when I had the van
Bought the tour bus and put some niggas in the pass
Your style good enough to put in a Glad bag
You know I’m gettin’ mines, you should use a hashtag
Flow off the hinges tryna fuck all her friendses
Just killed the pussy, you gon’ have to use forensics
Organized crime, you could put me in a lineup
Plus I got dreads, I’ll pay a hundred for the line up

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
Appetite for destruction, and I don’t need a menu
So far ahead of y’all niggas, I can see you in my rearview
See you in my rearview, one of your headlights out nigga
I just got my first R&B bitch and got head all night with her
She said she tired of the generic
I say what up, she say what up, what up, you a parrot?
I’m like “Bird ass girl, aren’t you sick of the rhetoric?”
And, if I ain’t arrogant, I’m out of my element, ugh
