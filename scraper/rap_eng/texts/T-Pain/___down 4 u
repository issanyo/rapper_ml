[Intro: T-Pain and blackbear]
Yeah yeah
I'm only down, I'm only down for you
Yeah yeah
I'm only down, I'm only down for you, oh
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah yeah yeah
Don't make a sound, don't make a sound, girl

[Verse 1: blackbear]
Yeah, I'm only down, I'm only down for you
Tellin' me "Quiet," don't make a sound for you, uh
Roll out the red carpet on the ground for you
G5, blowin' that loud up in the clouds with you (yeah, yeah)
Them other girls, they look like clowns 'round you (yeah, yeah)
And no other girl can take that crown from you, oh (yeah, yeah)
And you give good head, make daddy real proud of you (yeah, yeah)
That's true

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'm only down, I'm only down
I'm only down, I'm only down
Down

[Verse 2: blackbear]
And all those other girls that you think I'm creepin' 'round with, I ain't, girl
I'm only down for you
I'm only down for you, what your friends say just ain’t true
I'm only down, only down for you
No Kendrick but Peter Piper picked a pack of peppers
We were supposed to be forever ever
That turned into worse and ever ever
I was in the gas room stressin' 'bout whatever
Pop pills like Skittles back then
You wasn't even real with me back then
I done change now, I done change now
I'm only down, I'm only down for you

[Chorus: blackbear]
I'm only down, I'm only down
I'm only down, I'm only down
Down

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah)
Lookin' like I stepped out a coffin (coffin)
White boys call a nigga awesome (awesome)
You know I do this shit, make it often (often)
Hatin' ass bitches, I get 'em off, yeah
Buttercream, buttercream, got you saucin' (saucin')
Grill on your teeth, got you flossin' (flossin')
Winnin' team, winnin' team, no losses (losses)
And we don't give a damn what it's costin'
I'ma lay it down like a nigga got a verse on it (verse on it)
Dead ass, I'ma put the hearse on it (hearse on it)
Communication, I know that I gotta work on it (work on it)
But you're killing me baby, I need a nurse on it (oh)
Supreme LV's on your purse and your clothes (clothes)
Tell them other bitches that the first gotta go (go)
Niggas all done put the curve on 'em (curve on 'em)
Tellin' you say pin the rape wheel, swerve on 'em (oh)
You ain't gotta stress baby, oh
Them hoes make a mess baby, oh
Whippin' in the Tesla four door
And baby, trust me when I tell ya I ain't worried 'bout it

[Bridge: blackbear]
And all those other girls that you think I'm creepin' 'round with, I ain't girl
I'm only down
I'm only down for you, what your friends say just ain’t true, girl
I'm only down

[Chorus: blackbear & T-Pain]
I'm only down, I'm only down for you
For you, for you
I'm only down, I'm only down
Girl, can we talk? She said "nah"
Down
Tired of all this talk

[Outro: blackbear]
And all those other girls that you think I'm creepin' 'round with, I ain't girl
I'm only down for you, yeah
