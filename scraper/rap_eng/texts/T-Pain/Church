[Intro]
Ladies and gentlemen!
You already know what it is
Okay, yeah
Aw, shit!

[Intro: T-Pain]
I'm cuttin' a rug in this motherfucker
I'm tryin to anyways
Got two hard lookin' motherfuckers
C'mon

[Verse 1: T-Pain
I was.. tryin to enjoy my night but you done came here
Turned around the vibe I had befo' I came here
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you had to fuck up the night
Now if we got to fight, Imma knock out your lights
You ain't doin' nothin', but runnin' yo' yap-yap
You got to go to the trunk, homeboy, I am strapped strapped
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you had to fuck up the night
Now if we got to fight, Imma knock out your lights
Yo lil' lady tryin' to hold you back, you better listen to her
She better not talk that shit, Imma have to put somethin' straight to her
I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you had to fuck up the night
Now if we got to fight, Imma knock out your lights - c'mon

[Hook x2]
Yeah, God damn
You thank you cool, you thank I'm not, you think you tough
God damn;
You thank you hard, you thank I'm soft, you think you rough
God damn;
You talkin shit, better close your lips, you need to hush
Befo' the end of the night, I'm gon' have to take yo' ass to church

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
It was.. Sunday at the park
I'm chillin, tryin to get my swerve on
Some little lame tryin' to run that game, tryin' to get his serve on
Now I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you gotta fuck up the park?
Imma put you in the dark, clap on clap off
You ain't doin' nothin', but runnin' your piehole
You gon' make me do somethin' that'll get eye swole
Now I don't want to be a rude dude, man
Why you gotta fuck up the park?
Imma put you in the dark, clap on clap off
If that's yo' car you need to go ahead and get into it
Better not talk that shit you gon' make me put somethin' to it
Now I done turned into a rude dude, man
Why you gotta fuck up the park?
Imma put you in the dark, lights on lights off

[Hook x2]
Yeah, God damn
You thank you cool, you thank I'm not, you think you tough
God damn;
You thank you hard, you thank I'm soft, you think you rough
God damn;
You talkin shit, better close your lips, you need to hush
Befo' the end of the night, I'm gon' have to take yo' ass to church

[Bridge: T-Pain x2]
Those niggas think they hard, so why they think I'm not?
Until I pull they card and I show 'em what I got kinda like
(You don't wanna play around here nah)
(You don't wanna play around)

[Unknown female - 2X]
Them bitches think they hard, so why they think I'm not?
Until I pull they card and I show 'em what I got kinda like
(You don't wanna play around here)

[Hook x2]
Yeah, God damn
You thank you cool, you thank I'm not, you think you tough
God damn;
You thank you hard, you thank I'm soft, you think you rough
God damn;
You talkin shit, better close your lips, you need to hush
Befo' the end of the night, I'm gon' have to take yo' ass to church
