[Young Joc: ]Young Joc

I know just what you like, you say the swagger's nice
Tell your boyfriend take a hike, with them bugaboos on ice
Hop in the whip, feel them pipes
Make a little trip through the city at night, like don't stop
Get it, get it, guarantee to [?] you right
I can get you what you like, what you sippin?
Put it on ice, I insist cause you entice me
Flick my wrist, and put your wrist on nice

[Verse 1:]
Baby, I think it's time I tell you the truth, mmm (hey)
Cause I think I'm in love with your swagger and not you
Cause the way you walk and talkin', super vocative ooh
And I'm a lady when I'm in your Mercedes, and that's cool
But it's safe to say

[Chorus:]
I think I'm in love with the things that you got, yeah
That's what makes you hot, not you
And I don't mean to be mean, but I seems
To be the truth, I think I'm in love with your swagger

Ah, smack, ah, smack, ah, smack your swagger [x3]

Hey, hey

[Verse 2:]
I'm not saying that I'm telling you lies
Cause I got love for you, but I'm in love with the things you drive
Cause all of your clothes are so fly, but when you go by
You don't look so fly in em', but baby if you go buy new rims for your ride, I will gladly slide up in it
Because

[Chorus:]
I think I'm in love with the things that you got, yeah
That's what makes you hot, not you
And I don't mean to be mean, but I seems
To be the truth (Joc: Okay), I think I'm in love with your swagger

[Young Joc:]

Hol' up, cut this music
You mean that all this while
I've been thinking you love me
But it's more like my [?] style
You love my lavish habits, my large bank account
Somebody dial 9-1-1, like Chris Brown I'm bout to take her down
Let's get it, but you really can't blame her
I'm black, young, rich, and famous
Plus, I'm down to Earth, unlike these other entertainers
My daddy raised a G
My mama prayed for me
Now I'm hopping on and off the PJ, just to get me from A to B

Hate to say it, but they hate to see the way chicks gravitate to me
Snap my fingers, bring that cake to me
Number 1, they can't wait to be
Like don't stop, get it, get it
If you want it, come and get it
Tell em' what you wanna hear
Throw the deuces, I'm out of here

[Asia Cruise:] But it's safe to say

[Chorus:]

I think I'm in love with the things that you got, yeah
That's what makes you hot, not you
And I don't mean to be mean, but I seems
To be the truth, I think I'm in love with your swagger

Ah, smack, ah, smack, ah, smack your swagger [x3]

Hey, Hey
