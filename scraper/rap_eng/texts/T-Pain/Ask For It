"Ask For It"

[Nivea:]
La la la la la la la la la la ooh

[T-Pain:]
It's been two months and twenty days the last time I laid my eyes on you
(And I'm sick and tired)of not being around you
(And I'm sick and tired)of not seeing your face
And baby I kknow that it's killin you too
I can hear it in your voice when I'm talkin to you
(On the phone late at night) My conclusion is
(Being alone ain't right) I'm so confused babe
Cuase some nights I cry thinkin about you babe, can't do without you babe
Please believe me
ThatI got this thang covered, you ain't never gotta worry bout nothing
So baby please tell me

[Chorus:]
If there's anything you want
Anything you need
There ain't nothing in this world you cannot have
All you gotta do is ask for it
All you gotta do is ask for it [x2]

[Nivea:]
Many nights I cried thinkin about you boy
I been dreamin about you boy
Now we're separated boy
It's one thing to say but you gotta show you love me
Cause it's fifteen minutes after three and I'm still waiting to see
I-I-I I'm so tired of it boy
I-I-I done everything I could for sure
It's so long and I'm so gone and I know you niss me
I'll be out the door,ain't coming back no more
No I don't wanna speak to you... you, you, you
I did anything for you babe,everything for you babe
Used to say that I had you sprung
Used to treat me like number one
I guess I'll give you another chance
You better not pull that shit again

[Chorus:]
If there's anything you want
Anything you need
There ain't nothing in this world you cannot have
All you gotta do is ask for it
All you gotta do is ask for it [x4]
