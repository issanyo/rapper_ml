[Intro]
Whoop, Whoop, Whoop, Whoop
Pain!
Yeah

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Hold on, wait a minute, baby, watch out
Shawty lemme do this
Soon as they bring the Ciroc out
Imma get foolish
Roll around town with the top down
Bumping my music
So when I pull up to the spot now
Er'body gon' snoop it
Like, c-c-c-c'mon baby ball out
With a couple niggas from the south
Girl, you know that you wanna do that-that-that-that
Hatin'-ass niggas in the club keep talking
But you know that they gon' move back-back-back-back
Cutey with a booty, she into me
Cause I wanna see that whole fuckin' thing go clap-clap-clap-clap
Shoot it when you toot it, keep it moving, keep it moving
Baby let me see you, look I got that swag, swag, swag, swag

[Pre-Hook]
I'm coming I'm coming, I can't ask for anything better, better
Rolling up blunts and I'm spilling weed all over this leather, leather
Drunk as a skunk and she want me to take off my sweater, sweater
But I'm too cool, took her back home
And I ain't really wanna give her this dick (give her this dick)
But

[Hook x2]
I did it anyway (Yeah, I did it anyway)
She said that I could come back anyday
Cause all we do is drink and fuck
Fuck and drink, no dinner dates
I put her on the dinner table and put my face in her booty like a vanilla cake
I gave her that dick

[Verse 2]
I don't give two shits
She wanted me to pull the cock out
And I'm like baby lets do this
Lemme see you work all that, girl
Keep doin' what you do, bitch
I'm in love with your head game
Shoot it with an arrow like cupid
Like pop-pop-pop-pop-pop that pussy for a nigga in his home
Girl I know you wanna do that-that-that-that
Soon as I hit you with the D, I'm pretty much guaranteed you gonna come back-back-back back
I'm gonna make you tell all your friend 'bout me soon as that thing go clap-clap-clap-clap
Shoot it when you toot it, keep it moving, keep it moving
Baby let me see you, look I got that swag, swag, swag, swag

[Pre-Hook]
I'm coming I'm coming, i can't ask for anything better, better
Rolling up blunts and I'm spilling weed all over this leather, leather
Drunk as a skunk and she want me to take off my sweater, sweater
But I'm too cool, took her back home
And I ain't really wanna give her this dick (give her this dick)
But

[Hook x2]
I did it anyway (Yeah, I did it anyway)
She said that I could come back anyday
Cause all we do is drink and fuck
Fuck and drink, no dinner dates
I put her on the dinner table and put my face in her like a vanilla cake
I gave her that dick
