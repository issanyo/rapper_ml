[Intro: T-Pain & Field Mob]
Hello!
Oh, yeah
You ready baby
Ya see me like, do they love Teddy Pain in the street? (Yeah)
Field mob in thi' bitch (win squad)
Young Fyre
Lemme hear you say Kang
K-a-n-g, Kang
Okay, lets go in

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Teddy Pain is the name, bitch don't get it confused
All you lames in the game have never spit on a dude
Tell your dame to get a swimsuit and come get in my pool
She nodded once and now we working on (mmhmm)
I pull up on you with the quick fast, style on yo bitch ass
You niggas ain't holding weight the rap game been drinking SlimFast
See i go ham sandwich on everything i do
So when i put it down, all you pussy niggas can say it's (Woo!)
Da bad mon flow, niggas like whatsagan
Fyre dropping fire, ain't no need to turn the water on
So gimme a bitch with enough ass to put some butter on
And imma drop that shit that'll make a nigga feel guts all when it cuts it off

[Chorus]
If I'm lying, I'm down, I'm the bidness
Throw me in the jungle with a lion, Imma kill it
Die hard nigga, call me Bruce Willis
No time for fake shit, homeboy I'm the realest nigga
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
Too dangerous, too dangerous

[Verse 2: Smoke]
K is nothing new to me, so hate on, hate on
My eighty-year old twin sisters, same ol', same ol'
It's clearer than unicorn having glitter but six
With a fairy, skiing down that double rainbow
Range Rove, no shoes, the truck got the bare feet out
No more Ramen Noodles, like a dike I go and eat out
I'm bald headed, but still Nappy Boy is the click
Like game in sex, we the shit on a stick (pause)
My Chevrolet Camaro's high yellower than that nigga Drake
Rims blacker than Wesley Snipes, I'm sitting on blades
Like a barn on fire, I'm burning heavy hay
And Smoke stands for smoke, loads'a kush everyday

[Chorus]
If I'm lying, I'm down, I'm the bidness
Throw me in the jungle with a lion, Imma kill it
Die hard nigga, call me Bruce Willis
No time for fake shit, homeboy I'm the realest nigga
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
Too dangerous, too dangerous

[Verse 3: Shawn Jay]
They ask me what happen with Field Mob, I say two different egos clashing
Like Andre 3K and CeeLo's fashion
Got micro-smoke dose responds with so outrageous
Ya girl say Shawn Jay, ya smoke my favorite
I got her up in MySpace, smoking my grape kush
She follow me like I'm Twitter, then I poke her like Facebook
Realest nigga ever known, killin' every song
I don't fuck with lil boys, I ain't Bishop Eddie Long
I ain't trippin, nigga, go 'head, hate us bitch
These fact's I'm a mack, but I don't make up shit
I keep a click of killers with me winked up like ya baby mama
I'm a don with a Caddy, pussy nigga bring the drama

[Chorus]
If I'm lying, I'm down, I'm the bidness
Throw me in the jungle with a lion, Imma kill it
Die hard nigga, call me Bruce Willis
No time for fake shit, homeboy I'm the realest nigga
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
Too dangerous, too dangerous
