[Verse 1: Young Cash]
See, me dawg?
I'm trying to be on MTV, dawg
But I ain't paid rent and haven't ate in weeks, dawg!
Sweet Tea Mob, we the hardest, y'all soft
But it's hard to write songs when a nigga's lights out
I'm Big Virgil, that's Light Skin, that's Big Uzi
We become rap stars, and star in all the movies
I'll have a mansion in the Hamptons by P-Diddy
Got 500 million copies laughing at that nigga Fifty. (Ha ha!)
I'll be so rich, all my cars will be new ones, (will be new ones)
If I feel like it, might buy a couple humans. (couple humans)
Call Doela Man, tell him bring some weed around, (weed)
No more 5 dollar sacks, I buy 'em by the pound
Graduate from Dickies and Chuck Taylor's, dawg, (Taylor's, dawg)
Now I wear Gucci suits and Alligators, dawg. (gators, dawg)
I might buy a house on Mars, now I know y'all jealous
Cause my homeboys like "How's Earth, fellas?"

[Hook: T-Pain]
(We the mob)
We the thrillest, the truest, and the realist
I’m-a peel this cap until these niggas feel this motherfucka! (We the mob)
We hustle, we grind, and we solemnly swear
To never give a hoe a dime dime
(We the mob)
Understand I'm the man where I'm from
I'm-a rep my city 'til I'm done motherfucker!
(We the mob)

[Verse 2: Young Cash]
Yeah, we flyin' on them private jets
I'm so tired I had to much groupy sex
We doin' state wide tours so now what's next
We hitten' places where they speak no English
Now we back in Florida in Miami
On South Beach, tanning with my Grammy
Bought a Caddy for everyone in my family
The mob tight like the Jacksons Micheal, Tito, and Randy
I'ma go out a legend with plenty benji's
Considered one of the best, like Pac and Biggie
Sweet Tea Mob, yeah we run Florida
If I don't win the Battle of the Trillest in ATL, Georgia

[Hook: T-Pain]
(We the mob)
We the thrillest, the truest, and the realist
I’m-a peel this cap until these niggas feel this motherfucka! (We the mob)
We hustle, we grind, and we solemnly swear
To never give a hoe a dime dime
(We the mob)
Understand I'm the man where I'm from
I'm-a rep my city 'til I'm done motherfucker!
(We the mob)
We the thrillest, the truest, and the realist
I’m-a peel this cap until these niggas feel this motherfucka! (We the mob)
We hustle, we grind, and we solemnly swear
To never give a hoe a dime dime
(We the mob)
Understand I'm the man where I'm from
I'm-a rep my city 'til I'm done motherfucker!
(We the mob)
