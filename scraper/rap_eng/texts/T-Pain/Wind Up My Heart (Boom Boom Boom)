[Verse 1: Shun Ward]
Every night you feel you’re looking for a game out
What I’m feelin' I can’t really live without (oh no)
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
The phone is ringin' when I look in your eyes
’Cause there’s no meanin' if you can’t realize, no no
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me somehow?

[Chorus: Shun Ward]
You know that you wind up my heart
You know it can’t stop
Yes, you wind up my heart
You never live without
You know you wind up my heart
You know it can’t stop
But you know that you’re walkin' away
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Oh yeah
You wind up my heart, ooh oh ooh

[Post-Chorus: T-Pain]
Me and you, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Got, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Me and you, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Got, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Me and you, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Got, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Me and you, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Got, got me fiendin' for it

[Verse 2: Snoop Dog]
Lady, D-O Dubb, West Coast to the fullest
Tryna show y'all love
No doubt Dogghouse tryna burn one out
If I see a little freak, I’ma turn one out

[Verse 3: Shun Ward]
Every tear you cry will fall the way through
What I'm needin' you can't really lie, it's true
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me now?
My heart is poundin' when I sleep here tonight
And why it matters if you know why I’m right, yeah girl
Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?
Can you hear me somehow?

[Chorus: Shun Ward]
You know that you wind up my heart
You know it can’t stop
Yes, you wind up my heart
You never live without
You know you wind up my heart
You know it can’t stop
But you know that you’re walkin' away
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Oh yeah
You wind up my heart, ooh oh ooh

[Post-Chorus: T-Pain]
Me and you, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Got, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Me and you, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)

Got, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Me and you, got me fiendin' for it
(Boom boom boom boom)
Got, got me fiendin' for it

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Bring it over then close like a book
The way you shakin' that thing got me shook
See, you're on point like a T-Pain hook
And I just can’t let her go, oh
Bring it over then close like a book
The way you shakin' that thing got me shook
See, you're on point like a T-Pain hook
And I just can’t let her go, oh

[Chorus: Shun Ward & T-Pain]
You know that you wind up my heart
You know it can’t stop
Yes, you wind up my heart
You never live a doubt
You know you wind up my heart
You know it can’t stop
But you know that you’re walkin' away
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Boom boom boom boom, boom boom boom boom
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Boom boom boom boom, boom boom boom boom
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Boom boom boom boom, boom boom boom boom
Oh yeah, ooh eh eh, ooh eh eh
Boom boom boom boom, boom boom boom boom
Oh yeah
You wind up my heart, ohh ooh
