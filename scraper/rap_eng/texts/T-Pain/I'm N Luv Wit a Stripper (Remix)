[Intro: T-Pain]
(Konvict!)
Damn lil' mama, you thought Akon and T-Pain
Was the only ones in love with a stripper?
Forgot to mention Twista, Pimp C, Paul Wall
MJG and Too $hort? You know we had to remix this

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
She got the body of a goddess, everybody know that
Super cute face and the booty so fat
I'm in the club dropping twenty-four stacks
Because I'm in love and that's a well known fact
Like, yeah she know what she doing
If a nigga chillin' with a stripper then he never going back home
She got eyes butter pecan brown, can't leave it alone
Liking the way she break it down to the flo'
Need to get her over here and show her where
It's about to go down right now
I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 2: Twista & (T-Pain)]
You wanna know when Twista be on fifty
T-Pain invited me to Magic City
I'm about to have some fun, 2000 ones in these pocket
All my Evisu's with me (yeah)
I like the way mama get up on the table (yeah)
I like the way she pour the honey in her naval (yeah)
I like it when she smack her fatty and open it up in front of me
I wanna touch it but I ain't able
The one leg she can shake at the top of the pole (ooh)
Look at the laffy taffy when she pop, she roll (ooh)
I wanna get her in the bed right after they close
When I do a video, you get the popular role (ooh)
In the V.I.P. they get a lil' lap dance
Come and grind on the willy of a black man
In my ear tellin' me the shit a nigga like to hear
While I nibble on ya nipple like Pac-Man (oh oh)
She freakin', she lickin', she rubbin'
Then she pulled my dick out and start suckin'
All because I be the Twista
Even though T-Pain told me shorty was a freak
I asked her can I take her home (down right now)

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper, gotta get her, I, gotta get with her

[Verse 3: Pimp C]
Uh, young Pimp C
I'm a P-I-M-P, trickin' ain't in my pedigree
It really ain't bout no square love, it's strictly cause she payin' me
She be wantin' to lay me but I can't do too much of that
Cause even though yo ass fat, freakin' off ain't where it's at
But I can show you how to get out there and get it
You love yo daddy, I know ya with it
That's why I got love for you
Cause you get out there and do what it do
Workin' my piece and work the pole
Break the trick, you gotta pay to roll
Get the money, break 'em off
And we in the Benz and we scratchin' off

[Verse 4: Paul Wall]
Paul Wall baby
It was love at first sight when I seen that ass shakin'
And bout fifty dollars later, it was love in our makin'
Ya simply won my heart when I saw the way ya work that pole
And when you bent over, ya had my wallet in a chokehold
I saw you in your birthday suit and and baby it was fate
When you give me a lap dance, it's like we gone on a date
But I feel like ya cheatin' on me when I see ya dancin' with other guys
I'm runnin' low on ones, I can't lie I'm in love baby

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 5: R. Kelly]
I must be the first man to ever fall in love with an ass
Gonna roll down on my knees and ask that ass to marry me
That booty makes me forget about any chick I freak with in my past
Plus we got a lot in common: she’s a stripper, I’m a freak
Make me wanna grab it, I got a habit, I gotta have it
You can call me the man of steel cause that ass is just like a magnet
Damn, you got me so in love, can’t stay away from this club
Every time I find myself rollin up on them dubs
I been around the world, see booty all the time
I never seen a booty so so purty so so fine
(Err-rr-rr-rr) Comin’ down the pole
No secret why I’m here cause girl you keep my donk on swole
When it drop drop, when it pop pop, and when it hop hop
Baby the way you doin’ that thing don’t you stop stop
I wanna stick it, wanna kiss it, if I could
I’d put my whole damn head in it, cause I’m in love with a stripper

[Hook: T-Pain]

[Verse 6: MJG]
I'm in love with a stripper, I need to get some stripper counselin'
Cause I'm the first one in the front row when they make a stripper announcement
I think I'm fallin' in love with the one with the most ass
Thin, lil' bitty waist, I'mma go and buy that bitch a Volkswagen
MJG, pimp tight, no mo' tippin', stop the bill
If I come in here one mo' night, I'm gon' need Dr. Phil
But I'm a G, I'll step back and tell them bitches outright
Ain't no way I can turn a stripper to a housewife

[Verse 7: Too $hort & (T-Pain)]
The last girl was pretty (oh) but she wasn't fine as you
She was sexy (oh) but she couldn't do the thangs you do
She could dance (oh) but nothin' like the way you move
I used to want her (oh oh) until the day I saw you (oh oh)
I'm a grown ass man I thought I seen it all
Doin' all that on the pole and didn't even fall (oh oh)
And right then, I knew exactly what it was
(What's that?) I wanna fuck the baddest bitch in the club

[Hook: T-Pain]
