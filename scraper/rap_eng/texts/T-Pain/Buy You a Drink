Back to the crib, show ya how I live
Let's get drunk'n forget what we did

Won't cha meet me at the bar, respect big pimpin'
Tell me how you feel, mama tell me what you sippin'
A certified dime piece deserve Louis 1-3
150 a shot, 3 for you and 3 for me

I'm checkin' yo body language, I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips I get a tingling sensation
Now we're both 'bout tipsy, ya say ya in the mood
All I need is 'bout an hour, better yet maybe two

Let me take you where I live, Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in a ear, ya legs hit the chandelier
Passion fruit and sex all in the atmosphere
I'mma let T-Pain sing it, so he can make it clear

I'mma buy you a drank
Then I'mma take you home with me
I got the money in the bank
Shawty whachu think 'bout that
I'll be in the grey Cadillac

We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, (woah, ho oh) ooh ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, (woah oh, woah oh, woah oh,) ooh ooh (woah)

Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self

Let's get gone, walk it out
Now walk it out think 'bout it, oh snap
Now rock, rock, rock, rock
You can do it all by yo'self
