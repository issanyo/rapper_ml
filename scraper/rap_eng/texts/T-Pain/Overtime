[Intro: Akon]
(Ace Hood!) It's do or die
{Hey we go by The Runners} Gotta go put in overtime
Yea, cause it's now or never

[Hook: Akon]
I'm a put it on the line
Gotta win so I'm ganna grind
Put it overtime, overtime
Overtime, overtime
Cause I got money on my mind
Give me every penny, every dime
Put it overtime, overtime
Overtime, overtime, overtime
Cause it's now or never - put in overtime

[Ace Hood]
Well I'm sitting on the goal line, staring at the game clock
Facing a hundred years, 'member Jordan had the same shot
Carolina blue, California green
Jump for the white, get yo' frilly sheets
Ace Hood they go crazy when I'm in your city
Ace Hood, that's what they sayin in every city
I put my team first, we never reheard
We the best franchise cause it's squeeze first
Start the life where I give to the G-code
Drafted outta high school then I hit my free throws
You see them free shows, we call them free throws
Now it cost em 20 stacks just to witness me flow
Just to witness me flow

[Interlude: Akon]
It's do or die
Gotta go put in overtime, cause it's now or never

[Hook]

[Ace Hood]
Chea, on the road to riches and diamond rings
Real niggas do real things
I say hanging with the bitches and the songs I sing
Real niggas do real things
I'm listening to Pac, but it's a human being
If your tryna win the trophy then u gotta do it big
Louie on every bag, bitches I keep a flock
We donâ€™t need to see the tag, we just see it and we cop
Ballin out of control, put it all on the line
Oh mumma sippin for calfornia I want it triple time
Now get hold onto your seats, I'm about to double time
Ace Hood, Konvict we gonna put in overtime

[Interlude] w/ T-Pain singing along

[Hook] w/ T-Pain ad-libs - minus last line

[T-Pain]
Nappy Boyyyyy~!
And I can't slow down for nothing
See I gotta get overtime
Cause I'm a stay on my grind
Cause money stays on my mind
I feel like 24 hours just ain't enough for me
If you feel me put your hands up for me
This is overgrind, I'ma go for mine
I'm going blind cause I'm putting overtime

[Hook]

[Ace Hood - over Hook]
I gotta win, baby
Losing is not an option, ya understand me?
Ruthless is the way to go, ha
Blood, sweat and tears is what I've done, ya understand?
Put it on the line, baby
Hood is the name...

[Outro: Akon]
Ace Hood, Akon
We the best one time
