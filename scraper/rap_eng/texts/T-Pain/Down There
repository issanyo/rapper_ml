[Verse 1 (T-Pain)]
Things ain't looking good
Seems like there's nowhere to go except where I am right now
Trying to get up out this hood
Need to go somewhere I know, some people showed me how
To make things better, I know its possible
Even in stormy weather, it feels good to know

[Hook]
You wish everything was up and up
But its going down down down
Down down
It might seem like I don't care enough
That's why I don't come around round round
And I keep my ass where I'm supposed to be down there
I keep my ass where I'm supposed to be down there (x2)

[Verse 2 (Skye)]
Now enough is not enough
I ask myself what I'm doing here still
I can't believe its this hard to leave the ground
When that is all I sing about, my god
But who is gonna save me now?

[Hook]

[Verse 3 (T-Pain)]
All the sudden everything went southbound
And don't nobody wanna open up their mouth now
Cause they don't wanna offend their family or friend
I guess it all just depends whose fault this shit really is, right?
Who invented this way of doing things?
My mind racing, I feel like I'm doing 2 a day
Understand this what it take for a man
To stop him from fucking up whenever his leg is up
[vocal scratches]
That's what's up

[Hook]
