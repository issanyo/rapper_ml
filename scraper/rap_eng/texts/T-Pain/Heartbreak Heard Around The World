[Verse 1: Jacob Latimore]
Hell of a night, 3:32
Wishing that I was there with you
Stuck in a cab, too hard to drive
Yeah I'm just trying to survive
And I was thinking 'bout love, thinking 'bout us
Even the dream that we dreamed of
And I was thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout time
Thinking like I'm losing my mind
You got me singing like

[Hook: Jacob Latimore]
Oh oh, never gonna find another love like you like
Oh oh, I had another lover but she just won't do it and
I can't take it, so come back girl
Swear to God if you don't come back girl like oh oh
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world

[Verse 2: Jacob Latimore]
See I'm stuck in a mess, trying to find
Find my way back into your life
Dying for one, one night with you
Just one more chance, and that will do
Cause I was thinking 'bout lies, thinking 'bout truth
What can I do to make it up to you?
Thinking 'bout life, thinking 'bout time
Thinking like I'm losing my mind
You got me singing like

[Hook: Jacob Latimore]
Oh oh, never gonna find another love like you like
Oh oh, I had another lover but she just won't do it and
I can't take it, so come back girl
Swear to God if you don't come back girl like oh oh
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world

[Verse 3: T-Pain]
I know I ain't trippin', I gotta be honest
I ain't never felt quite like this
Anything you want, if I got it, you got it
Baby I don't wanna fight like this
I was thinking 'bout putting a ring on it
I should've gave you everything you wanted
I ain't gon' never find a girl like you
And even with this autotune
You got me singing like

[Bridge: Jacob Latimore and T-Pain]
Ooooh
Like ooooh
You got me singing like

[Hook: Jacob Latimore]
Oh oh, never gonna find another love like you like
Oh oh, I had another lover but she just won't do it and
I can't take it, so come back girl
Swear to God if you don't come back girl like oh oh
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world

[Outro]
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world
This will be the heartbreak heard around the world
