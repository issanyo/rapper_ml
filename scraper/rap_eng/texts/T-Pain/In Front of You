[Intro: Manny X]
Manny X
T-Pain
Yeah

[Verse 1: Manny X]
You text me every night before you sleep
I could tell that something's wrong
I could tell you wanna scream
You're surviving by refusing to believe
He is everything you've wanted, none of what you need
I've known you long enough to know that you deserve this
You even made me promise that I'd always be your friend
You asked me what I think (I think)
Imma tell you he's no good (no good)
I know you need somebody more like me

[Hook: Manny X & T-Pain]
Girl, I keep seeing you (Get hurt, get hurt)
And my brain keeps saying (Fix her, fix her)
But in the end, I'm just a friend
I can't tell you what to do
I been right in front of you, I been right in front of you
Oh, whenever you start crying
When you find out that he's lying
I'm in front of you
Oh, when he leaves you in your crib
And you know just what it is
I'm in front of you

[Verse 2: Manny X]
My shoulders catch the tears the world don't see
Everytime that a guy don't treat you right
And you cry out the night cause he leaves you tight
I'm right in front of you but you can't see
Cause he tells you the things that you want to hear
And you're blind by the fact that I'm standing here
I could never think of you any less
Girl you know I'd promise that I'd always be your friend
If you ask me what I think
You asked me what I think (I think)
Imma tell you he's no good (no good)
I know you need somebody more like me

[Hook: Manny X & T-Pain]

[Bridge: Manny X]
I wish you could see the light that shines in you
You don't know how much you're worth
That's why I believe in you
Cause I'm the kind of man you deserve

[Hook: Manny X & T-Pain]

[Outro]
I’m the kind of man that you deserve but…
