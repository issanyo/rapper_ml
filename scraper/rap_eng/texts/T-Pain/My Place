[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Yeahhhhh
How many times have I told you love you?
Don't seem to change a thang, girl you're not the same
There was a time when you wanted me to hug you
And treat you like, the lady that you wanna be
The girl I knew that wanted me
Would never try to hold me back
And do me all this wrong
Girl what's goin on?
I tried to talk and you walk away
Right out of my face, right out of my place, but

[Chorus]
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
How many times have we sat at a table
And both ate at one time, and said what's on our mind?
I'm thinkin our relationship was a fable
A fairytale to me, that's just how it seems (oh girl I heard)
Even when I heard that you was cheatin I was faithful
And would do any God damn thing that you would say too
I tried to talk and you walk away
Right out of my face, right out of my place, but

[Chorus]
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place

[Outro]
Heyyyy, heyyyy, heyyyy
