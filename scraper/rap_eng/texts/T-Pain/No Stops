[Hook: T- Pain]
Girl Im only in town for the evening
I got to be overseas by the weekend
So tell me if your down for some freaking
Ooooo Imma dive off the deep end
If you got a bad little body you could be my girl
But only for the night I could take you around the world
But the flights cost too much
I got a bad Bugatti
Girl you better suit up
Bottle of Petrone in it
Put you in the zone in it
Moment girl for the moment yeah!

[Verse 1: Jallal]
Talking the moments, the best I ever had
A lot of girls been scheming I just left them in the past
Left all of my problems she the only one I call up
You the one Inshallah you will never want a dolla
A lifetime in a moment, just wait for it to blossom
No other girl is finer, I don't care if they holla
We never need no drama, she can never be like mama
She wants to wake up with me tossing turning till tomorrow
You gotta feel the fire, you gotta feel the flames
Been written in our fate, ain’t no way you gon stop us
Ballin, Ive fallen, get up and play the game
Imma hold us down forever girl you know Ill do ya proper

[Hook: T-Pain]
Girl Im only in town for the evening

So tell me if your down for some freaking
You know we roll
Ooooo Imma dive off the deep end
If you got a bad little body you could be my girl
But only for the night I could take you around the world
But the flights cost too much
I got a bad Bugatti
Girl you better suit up
Bottle of Petrone in it
Put you in the zone in it
Moment girl for the moment yeah!

[Verse 2: Jallal]
Touch down in my city they're like where you been
Gone so much they think Im not American
Doing work, I didn't have a lot of wealth
Now Im never going broke and I know you can tell
Im that nigga girl you know Ill never be the one to go sell my soul
You stole my heart from the minute you came from heaven and took the fall
What you on?
Uh uh
Now here me I won’t change
Take my word were on the same page

I been alone it gets so cold
I need your warmth

Pick up the phone
