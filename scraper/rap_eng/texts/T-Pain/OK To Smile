[Talking]
This song is for my grandmother ONLY


[Verse]
I I I I, I'm losing touch with everybody
Ooh, what is now didn't matter
Is bruising up by anybody
Ooh, what a time to afraid
Uh, but I see the bright side
And I know it's okay to smile now
Uh, you gotta see the lights' eye
Every once in a while now oh oh
I I I I, I'm losing touch with everybody
Oh oh, so easy now
Cause I'm used to love, and all the sudden all is stopping
Uh uh, please don't leave me now
No no no, but you gotta see the bright side
And you'll know it's okay to smile now now
Uh uh you gotta meet the lights' eye
Every once in a while
Just every once in a while now now
One now now now
Every once in a while now now
One now now now
Just every once in a while now
