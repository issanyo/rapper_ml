[Verse 1]
I put my trust in a woman that got no trust in me
Cause I'm in love with her she's in lust with me
I can't go on without any control
She's got a grip on my love, superho
And mama told me there'd be days like this
She didn't tell me this woman would have my heart in her fist

[Hook]
She put the wool over my eyes
Get away, get away I tried and I tried
She put the wool over my eyes
No matter how I said goodbye

[Verse 2]
I know that I'm looking kinda like a fool
And I tried to get away
Tried to get away but no matter what I knew
Man she keeps on pulling me back to that hell she calls her home
The way she's treating me deceiving me I'd rather be alone

[Hook]
She put the wool over my eyes
Get away, get away I tried and I tried
She put the wool over my eyes
No matter how I said goodbye

[Verse 3]
If there's anything I've learned
It's probably nothing at all
And this woman will still be the death of me
She's got my heart , my mind, my body and soul and all
And I heard through through the grapevine
She's working on the rest of me, good God!

I tried and I tried
She put the wool over my eyes
No matter how I say goodbye

[Outro]
I know it's a man out there going through the same thing
Let me hear you say
I know it's a man out there going through the same thing
Let me hear you say
Wool over my eyes
