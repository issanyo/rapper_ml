[Intro: T-Pain]
Yea
Nappy Boy
FBI Man

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
From the second I was born I was in debt
Feel like I'm trying to fuck a bitch without a dick and she keep asking "Is it in yet?"
But then I gave the game a chin check
Told her sit your ass down and be happy I ain't fucking your friends yet
Hitting licks with a gun
Waving so many four-fives you'd think one of my hands was missin a thumb (Damn)
Got the whole industry on his knees
Record execs trying to steal my blow pop before I get to the gum
Uhh yea I'm everywhere that you won't be
So there's ain't no use trying that hating shit on me
Cause I'm gone speak, Nappy Boy everybody put your hands in teamwork on 3
Get to the money, hit the flea market and blow out
Something for your kids and niggas think you trying to show out
The only time I show out is when my record on replay
Hop out that Bugatti in some mother fucking PJ's
Bitch
Now who want it?

[Hook: Severe Da Young Drack]
Holy shit mother fucker god damn
That's what they say when they see me in my lam
I'm back in the streets and I'm bringing my fam
All of these wannabes know who I am
Haters got a problem with me and my man
But they get missing when its time to go ham
I'm on the grind and I won't stop for no man
Better get with the mother fucking program

[Verse 2]
I got bitches doing splits, hoes doing back bends
And niggas feeling awkward like a white dude with black friends
My Cadillac swims, Greg Louganis
If she ain't fucking me I kick her out quicker then Liu Kang (Whoo, Whoopsie!)
Do not fuck with him you don't want him
Cuz its a chance I might bust like and old condom
Yea, Its not as safe as you thought it was
My bass hit hard like it's a safe in my boxing glove (Boom!)
Uhh you should have got on and ran off
Jump out the window and pray to god you land soft
Keep talking shit and fuck around and piss my man off
And he gonna pull out something that can probably shoot your hand off
Thats hysteria having ?rigery? He getting shot in his frame I'm changing the scenery
He keep talking like he is that grown
And somebody gonna have to photoshop his limbs back on mother fucker
Yea, haha
Now who want it?

[Hook: Severe Da Young Drack]
Holy shit mother fucker god damn
That's what they say when they see me in my lam
I'm back in the streets and I'm bringing my fam
All of these wannabes know who I am
Haters got a problem with me and my man
But they get missing when its time to go ham
I'm on the grind and I won't stop for no man
Better get with the mother fucking program

[Verse 3]
3rd time Pizzle
Pardon my expression I'm just so disgusting
Bitches got me stressin' I sex em then fuck em
Then I make look to the music for a couple weeks
The say money talks come hear my Gucci duffles speak
But luckily, you niggas fuck with me
So I'mma auto-tune the whole world and take it up a key
I keep it snuck on me
Thats why your girls said she felt something else where my fucking belt buckle be
I'm too raw for the meat market
That's why it takes no time to get the beef started
Teddy Pain I'm harder then some fuckin Caridnals
They say I'm broke, bitch is you fucking retarded?
I'll turn your whole click into half a man
I drop bombs, these niggas think I'm from pakistan
He spitting fighting words, so we have to fight
But most of you pussies ain't worth dick, hermaphrodite
Shit, now who the fuck want it!?

[Hook: Severe Da Young Drack]
Holy shit mother fucker god damn
That's what they say when they see me in my lam
I'm back in the streets and I'm bringing my fam
All of these wannabes know who I am
Haters got a problem with me and my man
But they get missing when its time to go ham
I'm on the grind and I won't stop for no man
Better get with the mother fucking program
