[Verse 1]
Baby, look what you doing
You got every man you pass by trying to holla at you
Baby, you ain't even choosing
And that's just what I like about you, you're interesting
I want to be your next contestant

[Pre-Chorus]
(So I'ma tell you want you want to hear)
'Cause I know it takes much more
Than what's your sign or damn you're fine
Look like you havin a good time, baby
(I'm not gon' let you leave me standing here)
Wondering what it would have been like if I'da said it ain't a thang
But first I gotta know your name
She said I gotta play the game

[Chorus]
If I wanna be the next contestant
She can point me in the right direction
Now she got me so interested
Guess I gotta play the game
If I wanna be the next contestant
Ooh baby, I'ma come on down

[Verse 2]
Baby, you're a star tonight 'cause you got a smile that's so incredible
Plus you doin everything I like
And lady, you know I'm your type
I should be the one you're next to, ooh I want you
Know you see it girl so don't fight it, no

[Pre-Chorus]
(So I'ma tell you what you wanna hear)
Girl I know it takes much more
Than what's your sign or damn you're fine
Look like you havin a good time, baby
(I'm not gon' let you leave me standing here)
Wondering what it would have been like if I'da said it ain't a thang
But first I gotta know your name
She said I gotta play the game

[Chorus]
If I wanna be the next contestant
She can point me in the right direction
Now she got me so interested
Guess I gotta play the game
If I wanna be the next contestant
Ooh baby, I'ma come on down

[Bridge]
(It's my turn at the wheel to spin
And I know you looking at me wondering what's my bid, baby)
I was thinking we could chop it up and later on we can run away, yea-yeah
(So interested, who will she pick, I gotta be the one to win)
But in order to get her name and let the info exchange
She said I gotta play the game

[Chorus]
If I wanna be the next contestant
She can point me in the right direction
Now she got me so interested
Guess I gotta play the game
If I wanna be the next contestant
Ooh baby, I'ma come on down
