[Verse 1]
Waves upon waves keep me down
And I can't get to the top
But when I get there I'll still be nowhere
Cause I ain't find the one I love
And if I make it out
Then we shouldn't talk about how you left me
Just how you left me

[Hook]
Drowning again, yeah
Drowning again, yeah
Drowning again, yeah
You should see how good it would be
To come drown with me

[Verse 2]
Days upon days I've been floating
And you don't care if I die or not
But when I'm deceased I hope you will be
Dying next to me in my watery grave
And before we go I just want my baby to know
How it feels to be

[Hook]

Drowning again in your love
