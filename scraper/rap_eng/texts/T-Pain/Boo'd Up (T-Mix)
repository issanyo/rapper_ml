[Intro: T-Pain]
This shit been overdue
I'm still not over you, oh
This shit been overdue
It's a T-Mix, baby

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
They be like, "How many songs can you make about a booty?"
Like a thousand, ooh girl, you gon' learn today, come get this poundin'
I'm not finished, I'ma hit it in the shower
So get that thang tooted, booted, ready to get into it
I'm out here, babe
You fuck with lame-o's (you fuck with lame-o's)
They just copy me (they copy), they work at Kinko's (they work at Kinko's)
Tell your big friend come give me them cankles (gimme the booty)
Tell her her eyes and her legs gon' be in back of her head
Now, I can't even imagine what your DM look like (woo, ooh)
I see the future, you what my BM look like (huh, ooh)
Say you got a man, that don't even look right
But I know you be creepin', girl, I see you tonight (yeah)
Just give me 30 minutes, baby, I'll be on the way (I'm on the way)
Just keep that pussy on display (yeah)
You think I'm gettin' boo'd up, baby, oh no, not today (not today)
I'm 'bout to bust it out the frame (woah)
Dick dancin' everywhere, I do the Balls Johnson (yeah)
Dick you down, take you 'round, got you mall hoppin' (yeah)
You been ballin', baby, this ain't even called shoppin' (yeah)
Money get you wet, diamonds get your drawers droppin'
Ooh, boo, boo
You remind me of my '62, I see them subwoofers jumpin'
Between them thighs like shoot (BlocBoy), shoot (BlocBoy)
Shoot (BlocBoy), shoot (yeah)
Ooh, wouldn't mind gettin' all up in you
Girl, I'm 'bout to have you runnin'
I ain't speakin' nothin' but the truth, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I like the way you make that bottom toot up
She make that bottom toot up
I like the way you make that bottom toot up
She make that bottom
I just wanna see you make that bottom toot up
She make that bottom toot up
Make that bottom toot up
She make that bottom, I just wanna see you

[Verse 2: Ella Mai]
Yeah, feelings, so deep in my feelings
No, this ain't really like me
Can't control my anxiety
Feeling, like I'm touching the ceiling
When I'm with you I can't breathe
Boy you do something to me

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do

[Chorus: Ella Mai]

Biddy-da-dum it just won't stop, it go
Ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, boo'd up
Hear my heart go ba-dum, boo'd up
Biddy-da-dum, it just won't stop, it go

[Verse 3: Ella Mai]
Oh how, how many ways can I say that I need you, baby, it's true
I think I might die without you
Feeling all over my body
You know how I like it
Ain't gotta tell you what to do, yeah yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new
That get me high like you do, yeah yeah
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new

[Verse 4: Ella Mai]
Head over heels in love
Right in front of you, ain't gotta look no more baby (hah)
I wanna build this love
And everything you want, you ain't gotta ask for
You got me boo'd up, boo'd up
Boo'd up, boo'd up
Told you from the jump I'm the one to choose
Ya got me boo'd up, boo'd up
Boo'd up, boo'd up
Grab me by the waist baby, pull me closer

[Pre-Chorus: Ella Mai]
Ooh, now I'll never get over you until I find something new

[Outro: Ella Mai]
This is such a crazy feeling, like
I don't want to get too attached, but
I feel like I already am
My mind's telling me one thing, but
I guess I should listen to my heart
Right?
