[Verse 1]
If I didn't have diamonds in my chain
That Chevy horn sounding like a train
We made a movie
And now I'm so proud of my address
We're repping Ridge Road deep down
Four doors on a Chevy

[Pre-Hook]
Cause every song was like
Nappy hair, smoke, drink, Tallahassee, what's up
Boom, know what it is, nigga fill the truck up
We don't care, look at all these Cadillacs on 20s
And every song was like
Work hard, play hard, money over everything
Cowboy hat and the hood cap or the chain
We don't care, started from the bottom, now we're here

[Hook]
Seems like yesterday we was drinking Crown Royal
We ain't really give a fuck
Now they try to hate on us
And I just party on my bus
Let me see you get loose, girl
Everything is on me
So, nigga, come through
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2: Young Cash]

[Hook]
