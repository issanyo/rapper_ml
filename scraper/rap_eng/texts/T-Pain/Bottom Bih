[Intro]

[Verse 1]
My bottom bitch dont take that shit
She got a playing baby
Come from recruiting, got them eatin outta hand baby
Believe me, seen me hopping out that 'gini
Two bitches in bikinis, good eats chicken tetrozini
Im like woah
Whats the occasion for the evening
She said dont worry bout it just plan to do no sleepin
And that a go
We’ll put your hole on
And if she feel like it she'll fuck around and get your hole home

[Chorus]
I just look at her, say you
You, you, you, you, you, you
That's what I mean when i see you
You, you, you, you, you, you

[verse 2]
My bitch will put you on the stro-o-oll
I can’t wait to introduce you to my ho-o-os
First rule is to keep your mouth clo-o-osed
Don't come here putting that bullshit up your no-o-ose
Don't be talking shit outside your mu'fuckin' net
I pull me a gucci mane and put a bitch outside that vet
You been talkin' about getting money, i ain't seen shit yet
So go get your ass on up out that club and come get this check

[Chorus]
And i'm just gon’ look at you, and say you
You, you, you, you, you, you
That’s what I mean when I see you
You, you, you, you, you, you

[Outro]
You, you, you, you, you, you
That's what I mean when I see you
You, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you
And that’s what I mean when I see you
You, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you
