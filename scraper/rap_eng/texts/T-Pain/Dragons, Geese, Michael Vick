[Joe Biden]
Imagine with me for a moment
Imagine an America
Imagine a world (a world)
Where people pop the hood of their cars
And they see stamped on an electronic motor the words
Made in America (3x)
Imagine, imagine
Made in America (2x)
That's what I want to imagine
God bless y'all

[Michael Vick]
Now I wanna be part of the solution and not the problem
I gotta start somewhere, gotta crawl before I walk (ay!)
Crawl before I walk (ay!)
Crawl before I walk

[Evan Gregory & Sarah Gregory]
Before he flies like an eagle (whoo!)

[Scott van Pelt]
Michael Vick served his time
He paid his debt to society and now
He has either earned or been given another chance
