Welcome to epicness
I'm so dope and it's effortless
Yeah I'm tryna brag and boast
If you lookin' for the shit, nigga step in this
This-a-my-ting
Hoes in the backroom kissin my ring
Ready for the day, hit me with the Visine
Gett'n to the money, countin' up the ice cream
Me a baller, boy
She with me, you betta not call her boy
Imma pass around to all my boys
And she want the nuts like Almond Joy
Pimpin' since been pimp ass nigga
Whippin' expensive whips ass nigga
They be tryna hold me but they know I got the rolly that'll make yo fuckin' wrist go limp my nigga
Yeah, you a sin my nigga
I bet ya pocket full of lint my nigga
Everybody knows that I put it on these hoes I got her sounding like a motherfuckin' chimp, my nigga
Welcome to the jungle, dawg
Balenciaga by the bundles, dawg
My bitch gotta put a helmet on
Cuz' my wide receiver don't fumble balls
I'm rich as fuck, and y'all like that shit
I smoke good, nigga light that spliff
Throwin' money in the air make it right back bitch
And I'm drinkin' like I don't know what a nightcap is
