[Pre-Chorus]
I know you know you fine and you know I know
Trynna buss' it open like an Oreo
Knock that pussy out, talkin’ comatose
She gon' come to me, I'm the only one throwin’

[Chorus]
I know you ain't come here to make no money
Them niggas said they bought 'em, that's so funny
Now show me something new for this old money (buss it)
If I throw it at you, baby girl, that's yo money
That's yo money, that's yo money
If I throw it at that ass, girl, that's yo money
Take that, that’s yo money, aaah
Take that, that’s yo money

[Verse 1]
I know you ain't come in here to make nothin’
I'm throwin' hundreds, this ain't up for no discussion
My whip is disrespectful, my bank account disgusting
My bitch is sick with it, my section look like a GoFundMe, yeah
I came up in here with my money in a brown bag
I’m not gon' let one of you bitches catch me down, bad
Me livin' out here with some money, that just sound bad
Can't take the bottle, then all my niggas are down mad
Fuck it, i on know why we rushin'
Drop the top on the dawn, and all it takes is a button
Bitches like "Oh my God, them niggas came up from nothin' "
And no it's not a facade, them niggas really be stuntin', yeah
If shawty comin', she suffer the repercussions
I keep a plug, and she never gon' need for nothin'
I love my bitches, you always gon' see me cuffin'
If you ain't throwin' money, go make some readjustments
I ain't playin'

[Chorus]
I know you ain't come here to make no money
Them niggas said they bought 'em, that's so funny
Now show me something new for this old money (buss it)
If I throw it at you, baby girl, that's yo money
That's yo money, that's yo money
If I throw it at that ass, girl, that's yo money
Take that, that's yo money, aaah
Take that, that's yo money

[Verse 2]
Shawty bust that shit for me
My family with me, and my cousin trynna see
I told them thots what you be doin with yo teeth
All they gotta do is play new Teddy P and she start goin'
She goin, imma follow you till that main stage
You know it, you know it
You and me be on that same page
You packing on that form
Me and the wife be trynna do the same thing
Keep that liquor flowing, bitch its motherfucking game day
Listen only thing that we missing is bout a couple more bitches that can give me some assistance
Putting that work in the kitchen, butt naked cookin' me chicken
She know that I fuck her good, she said i deserve depictions, yeah
I got her coming back to back like it was nothin'
I keep her flooded, her shoes always be bloody
I love my bitches, you always gon' see me cuffin'
If you ain't throwin' money, go make some readjustments
I ain't playin'

[Pre-Chorus]
I know you know you fine and you know I know
Trynna buss' it open like an Oreo
Knock that pussy out, talkin' comatose
She gon' come to me, I'm the only one throwin'

[Chorus]
I know you ain't come here to make no money
Them niggas said they bought 'em, that's so funny
Now show me something new for this old money (buss it)
If I throw it at you, baby girl, that's yo money
That's yo money, that's yo money
If I throw it at that ass, girl, that's yo money
Take that, that's yo money, aaah
Take that, that's yo money
