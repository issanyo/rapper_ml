{*distorted*} "Where is everybody?"
"Don't stop now..."
"Don't stop now..."

[T-Pain]
Heyyy, yeah
I don't really wanna do nothin today
Just wanna do you tonight (you tonight)
And the only way that I'll be satisfied
Is if I do you right (do you)
I want you to feel it (feel it) comin (comin)
Stronger (stronger) longer (longer)
If fuckin you ain't the right thing to do
Then I can't get no wronger (wronger)
I'm pullin (pullin) hair (hair)
Slappin derrieres ('ere)
All you gotta do is say {"Don't stop now"}

[Hook: T-Pain]
And I won't, I promise this
I'm gon' be the dominant one, I got you bitch
Squeeze that pillow, bite that shit
Ohhh, it feel good, don't it? (don't it?)
Tell me that you want (want it)
Shorty call me daddy {"Don't stop now"}
Don't stop it (stop it) stoppin
Don't stop it (stop it) stop it
Don't stop it (stop it) stop it
Don't stop it (stop it) stop it
Don't stop it (stop it) stop it
Don't stop it (stop it) stop it
Don't stop it (stop it) stop it
Don't, don't stop now

[T-Pain]
Girl, I don't really know what else I can say
But baby girl you look tight (you look tight)
And I'm sittin right here lookin in your eyes
And they're tellin me everything you might like (you might)
I want you to feel it (feel it) comin (comin)
From a bigger (bigger) nigga (nigga)
I'm not what you're used to fuckin with (oh no)
I'm a little bit thicker (thicker)
I'm pullin (pullin) hair (hair)
Slappin derriere ('ere)
All you gotta do is say - don't stop now
