[Chorus: T-Pain]
'Cause, I just told my girl about you and she said you sound straight
She said bring her to the house, let's have a date
Now, I just told my girl about you and she said you sound cool
Baby, what you wanna do?
'cause I got money, bitch I can pay your bills
I got a motherfucking house up on the motherfucking hill
I got money, bitch I'm trappin' in the 'ville
All this drug money got me puttin' ice up in my grill

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I got way more than y'all talkin' 'bout
I got cheese like I work at Waffle House
I got way more, y'all niggas just talking shit
If you gon' leave my house you need that walkin' stick
I told her when the light hit the eye it twinkle and gliss
Yeah she put my chain on and let me play with them titties
Got the draco on me, ain't nobody playin my niggas
Can't describe you how I want to let me paint you a picture

[Chorus: T-Pain]
'Cause, I just told my girl about you and she said you sound straight
She said bring her to the house, let's have a date
Now, I just told my girl about you and she said you sound cool
Baby, what you wanna do?
'cause I got money, bitch I can pay your bills
I got a motherfucking house up on the motherfucking hill
I got money, bitch I'm trappin' in the 'ville
All this drug money got me puttin' ice up in my grill

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
I got bitches waiting on me in the buildin'
They know I'ma put that dick up in 'em
They want some of my money, I'ma give 'em some
I do that porno DVD for $50 million
But first I leave my ice on, turn the light on, let it twinkle and gliss
Get that money shot, let me bust a nut on them titties
Got that draco on me, bitch I need that check when I'm finished
Can't describe you how I want to, let me paint you a picture

[Chorus: T-Pain]
'Cause, I just told my girl about you and she said you sound straight
She said bring her to the house, let's have a date
Now, I just told my girl about you and she said you sound cool
Baby, what you wanna do?
'cause I got money, bitch I can pay your bills
I got a motherfucking house up on the motherfucking hill
I got money, bitch I'm trappin' in the 'ville
All this drug money got me puttin' ice up in my grill

[Verse 3: Manny G]
I got bitches on the high
I got your main ho on the low, low
I got hittas who have shot these niggas like a yearbook photo
I got paper, I got patience, I got favor, I'm on go-go
I got people who get lit to my shit they yell out "YOLO"
The way I'm coming down you couldn't catch me with a circus net
I'm on a xan I'm on a perc, I call it xercocet
I got your bae and I know you know she worth a check
I told my girl about her, she say "Ooh where she at?"

[Chorus: T-Pain]
'Cause, I just told my girl about you and she said you sound straight
She said bring her to the house, let's have a date
Now, I just told my girl about you and she said you sound cool
Baby, what you wanna do?
'cause I got money, bitch I can pay your bills
I got a motherfucking house up on the motherfucking hill
I got money, bitch I'm trappin' in the 'ville
All this drug money got me puttin' ice up in my grill

[Outro: T-Pain]
'cause I got money, bitch I can pay your bills
I got a motherfucking house up on the motherfucking hill
I got money, bitch I'm trappin' in the 'ville
All this drug money got me puttin' ice up in my grill
