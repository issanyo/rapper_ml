[Verse 1]
I gotta start by thanking the lord, (because)
I don't wanna see no face more, (than yours)
Cause you
Got a kinda persona that can not be ignored
Anymore
I got ya
For sure
I got ya
Cause your
Body just the type I want against me
You with me?
You the only girl I know that fits me
You get me
Feels like a love bug bit me
I gotta find you quickly
Because I don't even know your name

[Hook]
I'm hoping you feel the same
I don't want you to think I'm insane
But you just keep looking my way
I ain't shootin' no game
'cause
'Cause I don't even know your name (2x)
Girl

(Bridge)
I gotta find you quickly
Because I don't even know your name

[Hook x2]
