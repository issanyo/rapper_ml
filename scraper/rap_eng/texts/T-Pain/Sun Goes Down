[Verse 1: T-Pain]
The sun goes down and the moon comes up
The blunts go round, everybody getting drunk all night, all night, yeah yeah
Pull up and I’m swerving, hopping out hella clean
Park it on the curb and make that fucking Chevy lean
You know I deserve it, I’m gone have a good time
We gone have a good time together, biddy bye bye
Goodbye all that bad shit, get that out your head girl
You came here to party, let’s do this instead girl
I know you deserve it if you free your mind up
We can have a good time whenever
How can I tell ya what I want to say, want to say
Without you sending me on my fucking way, fucking way
But I don’t mean no harm, a nigga just tryna see what’s cracking
You was walking round this party
Like you don’t know what happens

[Hook]
When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
The blunts go round, everybody getting drunk all night
You know we put it down put it down, all night
And we gon fuck around, fuck around
And now now everybody drinking, and everybody smoking
Party on, party on, I'ma keep this bitch going all night
You know we put it down put it down, all night
And we gon fuck around, fuck around, all night

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Shawty what your name is, tell me this, tell me that
I love the way your frame is, drop it low, bring it back
I know why you came here, you gon have a good time
We gon have a good time together, biddy bye bye
Get this party started, I’m up in this bitch now
Throwing money in the air, everybody rich now
Hop up on this couch girl if you come and sit down
We can have a good time forever
I cannot tell ya, what I wanna do, wanna do
Cause I’ll do anything and everything to you, thing to you
But I don’t mean no harm, come and get on some of this pappy
You was walking round this party
Like you don’t know what happens

[Hook]
When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
The blunts go round, everybody getting drunk all night
You know we put it down put it down, all night
And we gon fuck around, fuck around
And now now everybody drinking, and everybody smoking
Party on, party on, I'ma keep this bitch going all night
You know we put it down put it down, all night
And we gon fuck around, fuck around, all night

[Verse 3: Pricetag]
(My girl bad with the baddest head
She in the bed doing magic tricks
We pass out after passing meds
We living on the jagged edge
So where the party at?
We gone smoke and spread love until Bob Marley back
And take shots at every bar we at
I feel like I got bar up cause these niggas hardly rapping
Girl you know my style, I’m Price, I know you want to go all night
Teddy Pender told me bout her type
Told me girl you ain’t nothing nice

[Verse 4: Oktane]
You ain’t s’posed to be out tonight
You got work tomorrow, probably got class
Got your girls with you, all of em got ass
And y’all got in for free to sit and look mad
Look here come to my spot, leave you purse and your camera phone
No pictures lil mama, leave that alone
Tryna get that from the back and the back alone
I know that’s too forward, but damn I’m on
Busting, and shake it cause you know you ratchet
Girl ain’t nobody looking, quit acting
Like you don’t what happens

[Hook]
When the sun goes down and the moon comes up
The blunts go round, everybody getting drunk all night
You know we put it down put it down, all night
And we gon fuck around, fuck around
And now now everybody drinking, and everybody smoking
Party on, party on, I'ma keep this bitch going all night
You know we put it down put it down, all night
And we gon fuck around, fuck around, all night
