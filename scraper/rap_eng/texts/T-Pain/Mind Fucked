Shawty, Yeahx3

Hello, I was thinking bout you
What you're doing, ain't it raining out there
Yeah cause I'm on the other side of town and I was
Thinking bout taking a ride on down to come and see you
Girl I know it's been two weeks
And I got you feeling like you've been knew me
Ohhhh that's what the truth do
Don't try to put up them walls I see through you
And I can see that you been hurt before
But girl that wasn't me, so we can take it slow
Gotta get you 'fore my times up
Talk to me baby

Chorus:
Come and get your mind f*cked alright, alright
I'll make you feel like you want something good
Got what you want, what you need
Don't make me beg baby please, come and get your mind f*cked
All night, girl I wish them other niggas would
Tryin to be like me, take a chance and you'll see
Baby you gonna get your mind f*cked

I'm just f*cking with you
Hope for sure you know
I wanna do something with you
First I get up in that brain and remain the same
After we play this freaky game say my name t-pain t-pain

Yeah yeah I'm bout to put your fucking knees in the air
But if I do it now, how would feel about me
Would you kick me out, or give me that body
Cause I can see that you've been hurt before
Girl that wasn't me so we can take it slow
I'm 'gon get you 'fore my time's up
Fuck with me baby

2 x chorus:
Come and get your mind f*cked alright, alright
I'll make you feel like you want something good
Got what you want, what you need
Don't make me beg baby please, come and get your mind f*cked
All night, girl I wish them other niggas would
Tryin to be like me, take a chance and you'll see
Baby you gonna get your mind f*cked
