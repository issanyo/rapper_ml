[Featuring: Stat Quo]

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm sprung
Out to get me..
..got me doin things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you [2x]

You dooooo [x7 while Stat Quo doing verse 1]

[Verse 1: Stat Quo]
The moment I cut her I knew she had me
The way she scratch my back and call me daddy
Shotgun in the Broham Caddy
Sexy physique and she cook like Patty Labelle
Her talk, her walk, our chain
I love the way shorty work that thang
Hump sprung I gotta charge to the game
Stat Quo on the rap, I'ma let T-Pain sing

[Chorus]
I'm sprung
Out to get me..
..got me doin things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you [2x]
You dooooo [x5]
Do [x16]

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Oh, I'm sick when you tellin me you leavin me
What did I do to you to make you hate me, the way you do?
I'm tired of all the games that you wanna play with me
Cuz you wanna get away from me
Maaan you really don't deserve me, all you wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from you
Now I'm leavin quickly, before the guys come to get me
Cuz I'm takin everything with me, but it all comes down to

[Chorus]
I'm sprung
Out to get me..
..got me doin things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you [2x]
You dooooo [x5]
Do [x16]

[Verse 3:]
You tellin me you sprung, well I'm sprung too
Only think bad about it, is i'm sprung for you
I ain't throwin in your face what I've done for you
But I have visions to see us on a honeymoon
Damn right, I'm on my way to the crib
I have no means to tellin you how I feel, cuz it's all done now
All your clothes and your shoes 'bout to get thrown out
All your tires 'bout to get blown out
I feel bad cuz you think it's easy
You told me a year and 2 months ago, you would never leave me
But now it's like you hate to see me
I remember the first day, you couldn't wait to see me
But now you wanna take everything and leave
But what happened to the love that you had for me?
You said you would marry me
It's too bad, cuz I'm sprung

[Chorus]
I'm sprung
Out to get me..
..got me doin things I'd never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you [2x]
You dooooo [x5]
Do [x16]
