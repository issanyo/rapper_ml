[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Lamborghini dreams, bitch I mean what I say
Do it for a purpose, you just here by mistake
Put that lobster over here by that steak
If you looking for some hits, I got ten on the way
I ain’t fucking with these niggas, I’m an industry virgin
Penitentiary flows, reinventing the cold
Listen to these niggas venting they soul, getting they hoes
Fuck her dead raw then leave that bitch in the cold, woah
I probably shouldn’t be doing this while I’m pissed off
Cast told me get in this bitch and just get my shit off
Boy I been off the chain, I decided to let the pit off
And as far as autotune, its’s my dick you niggas can get off
We winning though, Nappy Boy bicentennial
It’s all about [?] when you fuck with the principle
So take notes or let that motherfucking pencil go
[?], Nappy Boy, bitch I’m invincible

[Hook: Vantrease]
My nigga this is business, so don’t take it personal
If you don’t have my best interests, then you’ll be the first to go
I can hear them all talking, sounding like a broken record
It’s the same old thang
I don’t sweat them motherfuckers, I just keep it 100
Do the same old thing

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
If you ain’t got me, I ain’t got you, I don’t give a fuck about you
And you bout to see all of the shit that I can do without you
I’m a monster, I defeat crews
Get on my diet bitch, see food, eat food
Like you got to question what I do it for
[?] and [?] what you shooting for?
What you think I’m rapping writing, singing, and producing for?
I be handling that shit that you making excuses for
Let’s keep it G and I can move on
Keep it cool holmes, keep your shoes on
Drop dead gorgeous, I get my crews on
You ain’t heard about Teddy Pain, turn the news on
Zoom gone, out the general vicinity
If niggas act like bitches then bitches is getting finicky
Nappy Boy, homie can I get a witness
You don’t want to end up on the shit list

[Hook 2]
My nigga this is business, so don’t take it personal
If you don’t have my best interests, then you’ll be the first to go
I can hear them all talking, sounding like a broken record
It’s the same old thang
I don’t sweat them motherfuckers, I just keep it 100
Do the same old thing
I can hear them all talking, sounding like a broken record
It’s the same old thang
I don’t sweat them motherfuckers, I just keep it 100
Do the same old thing
Do the same old thing
The same old thang
