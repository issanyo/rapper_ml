Chorus [T-Pain]:
Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me
(woooahhhh)
On a mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(woooahhhh)
I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above
All the above (x7)

Verse 1 [Maino]:
Listen
Really what do you see
When you looking at me?
See me come up from nothing
To me living my dreams
I done been to the bottom
I done suffered a lot
I deserve to be rich
Headed straight to the top
Look how I ride for the block
Look how I rep for the hood
I get nothing but love now
When I come through the hood
Getting this fortune and fame
Money make all of us change
The new benz is all white
Call it John McCain
How the hell could you stop me?
Why in the world would you try?
I go hard forever
That's just how I'm designed
That's just how I was built
See the look in my eyes?
You take all of this from me
And I'm still gon' survive
You get truth from me
But these rappers gon' lie
I'm a part of these streets
Till the day that I die
I wave hi to the haters
Mad that I finally done made it
Take a look and you can tell
That I'm destined for greatness

(Chorus)
Tell me what do you see
When you looking at me
(woooahhhh)
On a mission to be
What I'm destined to be
(woooahhhh)
I done been through the pain and the sorrow
The struggle is nothing but love (nothing but love)
I'm a soldier, a rider, a ghetto survivor
And all the above
All the above (x7)

Verse 2: [Maino]
It's easy to hate
It's harder to love me
Ya'll don't understand
Ya'll quickly to judge me
Put your foot in my Nikes
Picture you livin' my life
Picture you stuck in a cell
Picture you wasting your life
Picture you facing a charge
Picture you beating the odds
Picture you willing to bleed
Picture you wearing the scar
Thank you for making me struggle
Thank you for making me grind
I perfected my hustle
Tell me the world ain't mine
You've been seein' me lately
I'm a miracle baby
I refuse to lose
This what the ghetto done made me
I put that on my father
Tryna hope for tomorrow
When I think that I can't
I envision Obama
I envision the diamonds
I envision Ferraris
If the world was perfect
All my niggas behind me
Ain't you happy I made it?
That I'm making a statement?
Take a look and you can tell
That I'm destined for greatness

Verse 3 [T-Pain]:
Now if im up in the spot (spot)
Or if im out on the block (block)
I hustle hard cause it's all the same
And you know that grind don't stop
Just 'cause I rose to the top
And everybody knows my name
Still grindin (still grindin)
Still hustlin (still hustlin)
No more pain (no more pain)
No more sufferin (no more sufferin)
For my ladies and my shorties and my thugs
Keep that task, and the shine, and the love

All the above (x6)
