[Intro]
Go away, go away

[Verse 1: Jenniffer Hudson & (T-Pain)]
I've got this feeling today
A feeling I ain't never felt before
And it came from you
(And it came from me, yeah, oh)
So that means you can make it go away, make it go away
And I don't like the way
You've been hanging around with your
Face on the ground, what's the deal?
Can you make it go away, make it go away?

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson & (T-Pain)]
What's wrong with my baby?
(What's wrong with my baby?)
What's wrong with me?
(What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with us?
(What's wrong with us?)
What's wrong with we?
(What's wrong with we?)

[Post-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson & (T-Pain)]
'Cause every time we try to talk and turn this thing around
(Turn this thing around)
Tell me what's the deal and man we'll try to work it out
Is it you?
(You?)
Is it me?
(Me?)
Is it us?
(Us?)
Is it we?
(We?)
We've been through so much pain

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Baby calm down, no way
Believe it, tonight you got me feeling this way
And I never ever felt this way before
Didn't expect that from you
You trynna make me go away
And I don't like the way
We keep on buzzing and fighting but yesterday and last night, that's all news
We need to be strong
But you're making me go away, go away

[Chorus: T-Pain & (Jennifer Hudson)]
What's wrong with my baby?
(What's wrong with my baby?)
What's wrong with me?
(What's wrong with me?)
What's wrong with us?
(What's wrong with us?)
What's wrong with we?
(What's wrong with we?)

[Post-Chorus: Together + (Jennifer Hudson)]
'Cause every time we try to talk and turn this thing around
Tell me what's the deal and man we'll try to work it out
Is it you?
(Is it you?)
Is it me?
(Is it me?)
Is it us?
(Is it us?)
Is it we?
(Is it we?)
We've been through so much pain (Pain)
Yeah

[Verse 3: Jennifer Hudson + T-Pain]
Now let's stop playing these games
If we gonna make it work
Let's just act our age
Girl I'm hearing everything that you say
But I don't wanna make you go away, make you go away
I know I act like I don't care
I'm just trynna play it cool
But if we keep backing this way
Then that would make us both some fools
All the hurt and the lies and the pain
Need to make that go away, make it go away

[Chorus: Jennifer Hudson & (T-Pain)]
What's wrong with my baby?
(What's wrong with my baby?)
What's wrong with me?
(What's wrong with me, yeah?)
What's wrong with us?
(What's wrong with us?)
What's wrong with we?
(What's wrong with we, we?)

[Post-Chorus: Jennifer Hudson & (T-Pain)]
'Cause every time we try to talk and turn this thing around
(Turn this thing around)
Tell me what's the deal and then we try to work it out
(Work it out)
Is it you?
Is it me?
(Is it me?)
Is it us?
Or is it, is it WE!?
(Wooooo!)
