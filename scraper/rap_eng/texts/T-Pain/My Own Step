I can get this party started, watch how we can do it
I can get this party started, watch how we can do it
I can get this party started, watch how we can do it

(Roscoe Dash)

Step it up, step it up, step it up, step it up
Break the knob off right now
Crumpin' or stuntin', do what ya wanna
I'ma crank the party up right now

Roscoe be so flexed up
And I make it look so effortless
I show out, show out, everywhere I go out
Ten bad models watch me when I go out

Oh, I know I go so hard
I'ma big dog stick out my yard
Press record 'cause you gon' wanna take this spaceship
Takin' off on a one way to Mars

So you turn up regardless
Show out and go the hardest
Go dumb, go dumb, go dumb
Lose control and go retarded

See I got my own steps
And I got my own style
Overseas money, honey

R-O-S-C-O-E I done
Blew up like a landmine
And I'm winnin' by a landslide

I got my own steps, I got my own style
I got my own steps, I got my own style
I got my own steps, I got my own style
I got my own steps, I got my own style

I got my own steps, I got my own style
If everybody keeps stealin' it from me
Then I'mma have to go wild

Yeah, better back up, boy
When the DJ turn the track up, boy
'Cause all these haters in the club must really wanna see the
Teddy Pizzle act up, boy, clap, clap, clap, clap, boy

On the nude dance floor and I take your girl
To the show and tell
And if I perform well
That's gon' give her more to tell

Do just what we doin', girl
Don't even know what she doin', homie
If she take this trip again
You will never fit again

Steppin' in and out, I got my own step
My own clique
Lovin' on that chick I left her
In that club like, oh, shit

Oh, it's
Just another one of them classic T-Pain antics
Got her makin' up brand new dances
She get low to the ground like ants is

Every time I put on Antaris
All she think about is marriage
Homie, you can't pull no girls
You're like a horse without a carriage

Damn, I don't even know how many karats in my chain, chain
Buddy, do I have to explain, 'splain?
Nobody on the corner got swagger like us
You got yours from T-Pain

I got my own steps, I got my own style
I got my own steps, I got my own style
I got my own steps, I got my own style
I got my own steps, I got my own style

I can get this party started, watch how we can do it
I can get this party started, watch how we can do it
I can, I can, I can, I can, watch, watch, watch, watch
I can get this party started, watch how we can do it

Um, now that party's turned up
Whatchu gon' do?
Everybody with me boppin' like a hippy
I'd be mad if I was you

Because I party, party, party, hardy
Shorty, go retarded, 'tarded
Gon' and do yo dance and

Just go stupid, do it, do it
Show 'em you're the man
Or woman and can't nobody
Else do it like you can

Gon' and break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, do it with no hand
Ain't no copy cats around here
Boy, we settin' trends

I got my own steps, I got my own style
I got my own steps, I got my own style
I got my own steps, I got my own style
I got my own steps, I got my own style

I can get this party started, watch how we can do it
I can get this party started, watch how we can do it
I can get this party started, watch how we can do it
I can get this party started, watch how we can do it
