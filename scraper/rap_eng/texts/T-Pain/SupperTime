[Intro x2]
Come on, come on
Suppertime

[Verse 1]
It's all up under you now, all up in my house
I don't know when, don't know how
You thought I was going out

When the night has come
And as soon as you began to unwind
Is when I lost my mind
I think it's supper time

[Chorus +ad libs]
This heat's gettin' close to my, suppertime
I can't believe my, suppertime
Oh, I'mma feel lost, supper time, hey
Ooh, sing it, barbie girl
Come on, come on, ooh
Suppertime, oh, ooh suppertime

[Verse 2]
That mamba knocking us out
I chant him knocking you down
Got all up on my couch
How long has he been around?

Don't cut off the lights, let 'em shine
'Cause I can't find nothing right
With your bump and grind
I think it's suppertime

[Chorus +ad libs]
This heat's gettin' close to my, suppertime
I can't believe my, suppertime
Oh, I'mma feel lost, supper time, hey
Ooh, sing it, barbie girl

[Instrumental interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it's suppertime

[Chorus +ad libs]
This heat's gettin' close to my, suppertime
I can't believe my, suppertime
Oh, I'mma feel lost, supper time, hey
Ooh, sing it, barbie girl
Ooh, suppertime
