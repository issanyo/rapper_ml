Ooh
I know what you like
Convict

I just got off work. it's one thirty
I'm kinda hungry plus I know my girl lonely. Goin back to my crib, it's kind of early. Suprise my girl because I know she waitin'. I open the front door, I hear moanin'. For real somebody, Im gonna kill somebody. Then I get closer I hear groanin'. Bust in the door and see my girl with a chick, that's when I knew that-

Chorus
My girl got a girlfriend, I just found out but it's aight as long as I can be with her too
My girl got a girlfriend it really is not a problem cuz I'ma make it do what it do. Cuz havin two chicks is better than no chicks I'd rather just join in, keep my girl and keep the other one too
My girl got a girlfriend, it really is not a problem cuz I'ma make it do what it do girl

You know you're wrong shawty (could've told me) that you was sleepin with a chick (how the hell you want in it ) i thought it was better shawty, you're so stingy while you was kissin on me i could be behind ...
I could be mad girl but i'm so cool wit it both of ya'll in my bed and watch what i do to it. Girl i'm a fool wit it... i'm a fool wit it so slide over for me shawty let me show you how a player get down. Cuz girl i'm about to give ya both the business. Beat it up until you say you finished then i'll feel the other one gotta bust her like a gun so i really don't care then

(Chorus)
Yea, (yea) convict

(Chorus)
