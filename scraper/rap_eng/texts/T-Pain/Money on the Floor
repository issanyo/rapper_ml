[Intro: T-Pain]
Pick ya muthafuckin' money up (Hey! x4)
Let's go, nigga (Hey! x4)
C'mon, Teddy Pain, mayne

[Hook x2: T-Pain and Mistah FAB]
I throw my money on the flo'
Pick ya muthafuckin' money up
That's how I kick it with my hoe
Go pick a muthafuckin' honey up


[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I throw my money on the floor
The club like a boxing ring
And they call Teddy Pain to come and rock this thing
I'm on point, got new whizzles
Not Cash Money but I got 2 Pistols
Err'body goin jerk
We off in the party err'body off work
Do that Reject yeah it's prolly goin hurt
Shawty so fly yeah I'm prolly goin flirt
Or maybe just a little so she can show me her nipple
Then maybe later on I get in the middle
[?]
I can give you the feeling that it'll prolly give you the giggles
They call me the Jerk of All Trades
They go leave ya outburst in the hallways
'Cause I'm a put it down as always
Listen to what the fuckin song say

[Hook x2: T-Pain and Mistah FAB]
I throw my money on the flo'
Pick ya muthafuckin' money up
That's how I kick it with my hoe
Go pick a muthafuckin' honey up

[Verse 2: Mistah FAB]
Throw ya money down, I pick it up just like I want it
Everybody freeze, freeze, freeze you are now surrounded
Keep it on the blow, yo girl goin keep it on the low
That I be creepin' through her door around the quarter past 4
I'm super geeked I pop a lock a rocket body moving
Sugga jiggin' jankin' everybody in this party groovin'
Say a party ain't a party till Fabby get there
Super-duper show, your baby momma just don't stare
Hey, hi, ooh, how are you doing?
Thr33 Ringz like Teddy you are P-U-ing
Ahh, sorry for you
Who ever say goin holla what it do
Yeah, look I'm still do what it do
Steal a night for every party when they see me coming through
They get the hollin' ho-de-ho
When you give up all your money hoping you chunk up the deuce

[Hook x2: T-Pain and Mistah FAB]
I throw my money on the flo'
Pick ya muthafuckin' money up
That's how I kick it with my hoe
Go pick a muthafuckin' honey up
