Clap your hands to the beat this instant, this instant, this this instant (x4)

Ello ello mama
Tell me why you sittin down
Get up and pick up the pieces
Come and move your shit around
You look hot hot
Come n get cool
You ain't even got to know these steps
Imma show you what to do

Fire burning caliente
And if you wanna stop
Makin it hot
Then imma rock with you anyway
Scorchin smockin picant
Gimme that juice
Get a lil loose
Gonna do what the song say

This is the pole that you dance to and shake your funky stuff
If youre doing the same for the two step well then that just ain't enough
(Here we go)

Clap your hands to the beat this instant, this instant this this instant (x4)

Gonna do what the song say

This is the pole that you dance to and shake your funky stuff
If youre doing the same for the two step well then that just ain't enough
