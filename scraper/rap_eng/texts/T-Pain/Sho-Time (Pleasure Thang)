[Verse 1]
You better tie them heels up tight
'Cause I'ma make you work for it tonight
You been messing with me too long
Now it's time to come and get the game on
'Cause you been playing hard to get, now I got you here
Come on, girl
Baby, tell me what you wanna do
I know exactly what I'm doin' to you
All you need is a t-shirt and a thong
And let me turn this camera on
'Cause you been playing too hard to get, now I got you here come on girl
And I'll be like, yeah!

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm trying to get this pleasure thang poppin', should we be stopping?
And you be like no!
Girl, I know your nervous, but it ain't no time, like showtime
No, it ain't no time like showtime, come on girl

[Verse 2]
Baby come and lay down on your back
Don't look at me like that
Cause you already know and what it is
You about to see me handle my biz
Girl, I hope your ready, you ain't never had it like this
Come on, girl
You know I ain't faking, so your scared now
From the floor to the bed now, you believe everything I've said now
Fight that feeling, fight that headboard
Put your hand down! Oh!
Girl, you wasn't ready, you can better feel your legs now
And when you feel that thing coming
All you gotta say is, "Yeah!"

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm trying to get this pleasure thang poppin', should we be stopping?
And you be like no!
Girl, I know your nervous, but it ain't no time, like showtime
No, it ain't no time like showtime, come on girl

[Bridge]
Hey, girl it's all about that pleasure thang
Better put your running shoes on
Energizer bunny, baby, I just keep going and going and going all night long
Trying to make you feel good, just like you know I would
And if you ask if I finish what I start, all I got to is "Yeah!"

[Chorus]
Girl, I'm trying to get this pleasure thang poppin', should we be stopping?
And you be like no!
Girl, I know your nervous, but it ain't no time, like showtime
No, it ain't no time like showtime, come on girl
