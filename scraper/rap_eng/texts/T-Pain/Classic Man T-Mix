[Intro: T-Pain]
T-Pain, ballin' all night
In the ol' school, that bitch white-on-white (Nappy Boy!)
T-Pain, ballin' all night (Pizzle!)
In the ol' school, that bitch white-on-white
I'm four deep, my passenger side
Got a thick bitch that wanna be in my life
I'm like four deep, my passenger side
Got the whole strip club comin' wit me, I ain't' lyin, I'm like

[Bridge: T-Pain]
In the old school whip, in the old school whip
I got the Desert Eagle in the door way
You know that I'm from Florida babe

[Chorus: T-Pain]
So that mean I'm a classic man
Any whip from the 50s to the 90s
Catch me in a classic man
I'm in a Buick with a Chevy right behind me
Riding through Tallahassee, man
You see a mustang in the street like skeet!
That mean I'm a classic man, ha!
I'm a classic man, woo!

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I burn through them tires like whoa
Paint job shining damn near like gold
My 6-4 sitting on floor, low-low
That bitch ain't nothing like that TT yolo
Screamin' yolo switching lanes in that Oldsmobile
455, rubber sure gon' kill
I'm an old school nigga till I'm gone on the real
So you can keep that feeling 'cause I know it don't feel like it feel

[Bridge: T-Pain]
When I'm in the old school whip, in the old school whip
I got the desert eagle in the door way
You know that I'm from Florida bay

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm a classic man
Any whip from the 50s to the 90s
Catch me in a classic man
I'm in a Buick with a Chevy right behind me
Riding through Tallahassee, man
You see that Mustang in the street like skeet!
That mean I'm a classic man, ha!
I'm a classic man, woo!

[Verse 2: Vantrease]
Boss nigga in the '91 Ferrari
Headlights flippin' up and down, I ain't sorry
Supercharger head on that bitch, so retarded
Turn the bass up, you'd've thought it was a party (p-p-party yeah)
See I'm a classic fan
454, my shit the fastest, man
Switches on the bitch, I put the ass in the sand
Low-pro tires look like elastic bands

[Bridge: Vantrease]
Yeah, I just copped the new whip, stuntin' in my new whip
I'm hoppin' out my new whip, sharper than a toothpick
'Cause baby, I'm a classic man

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I'm a classic man
Any whip from the 50s to the 90s
Catch me in a classic man
I'm in a Buick with a Chevy right behind me
Riding through Tallahassee, man
You see that Mustang in the street like skeet!
That mean I'm a classic man, ha!
I'm a classic man, woo!

[Verse 3: Young Cash]
I'm in the Chevy Impala boy 7-3
Dreads hanging out the 'vert like a palm tree
You see the orange jumper tag, I'm from Florida baby
'85 Monte Carlo, I restored it baby
My whip a classic, nobody else has it
An antique like your grandma's couch with the plastic
Got the brains blowed out with the digi-dance
Candy paint so wet, jump in and splash

[Hook 1: All]
Now look at them Forgis, now look at them Forgis
(I hope I don't crash it man)
And all them hoes on me, and all them hoes on me

[Chorus: T-Pain]
('Cause my whip is a) classic man
Any whip from the 50s to the 90s
Catch me in a classic man
I'm in a Buick with a Chevy right behind me
Riding through Tallahassee, man
You see that Mustang in the street like skeet!
That mean I'm a classic man, ha!
I'm a classic man, woo!

[Outro: T-Pain]
In the old school whip, in the old school whip
I got the, Desert Eagle in the doorway
You know that I'm from Florida, babe
So that mean I'm a classic man-man-man
