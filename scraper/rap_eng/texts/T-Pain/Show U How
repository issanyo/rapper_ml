[Intro: T-Pain]
Oh fo sho'
Ay, Jaylil
Who that, who that, who that girl is over there?
Damn, though, she can't be a ho
I don't believe it!
Fuck that, I'm 'bout to go talk to her
OoooooWEEEEeeeee~!
That's right
Back at it mayne, okay
T-Pain, ay, ay, ay, HEY!

[T-Pain]
Man I got a thing for a girl that I don't even know
E'rybody in the hood say she's a ho
But I don't think so, I'mma tell you anyway
I can turn a ho into a housewife any day
It can even go the other way around
That's because of the pimpin from Teddy Penderazdoun
Okay here come the manipulation
I ain't tryin to please her with my money precipitation
Aviatic watch and the Aviatic piece
Yellow bracelet and the King Johnny teeth
I can be like: "Hey miss lady! I got a black and grey Mercedes
I got a Cadillac car and a Cadillac truck"
Man, but I got a feelin' she really don't give a fuck
I want to get to know her
And if I give her the keys to my crib
I'mma sit her down and show her she can

[Hook]
Lay down and let me lay wit'chu
If you stay around then Imma stay wit'chu
Ain't no way I'm leavin girl, let's talk about it
Imma gonna show you how to love somebody

[Verse 2]
She a cool, super duper down-ass bitch
If she was a cup of liquor I would down that bitch
Like (dun dun dun dun dun dah dahhhh!) Nappy Boy Queen
God damn, I done crowned that bitch
Two weeks, and we done fell into it
And ain't nobody have to tell her to do it
I'm askin the questions about befo' me
I had to make sure I knew she wasn't a ho
She just lookin fo' a nigga that can treat her like Pain
Take her to the movies, buy her brand new thangs
But niggas treat her like: OH SKEET SKRRRR!
Never heard of 'em
Ripping up a phone number
Never heard a word from 'em
But she ain't got to worry about them niggas
Live life shawty you can do without them niggas
Ay, but what can I say? Tell them kiss yo' ass
Cause at the end of the day you got a place to

[Hook]
Lay down and let me lay wit'chu
If you stay around then Imma stay wit'chu
Ain't no way I'm leavin' girl, let's talk about it
Imma gonna show you how to love somebody

[Bridge x2]
Don't listen to them, they just jealous of you and me
I care less 'bout what you did, that ain't got nothin' to do with me
I'm in love, you are too, so let's do what we do
And baby girl Imma show you how to love somebody

[Hook x2]
Lay down and let me lay wit'chu
If you stay around then Imma stay wit'chu
Ain't no way I'm leavin' girl, let's talk about it
Imma gonna show you how to love somebody
