[rapping: T-Pain]
Man I been gone for way to long
When I come back I snap on niggas
Deficatition is an assessity
I had to crap on niggas
And it's not even the trust nigga my daddy told me too
You can lay in yo bed scared of what them Nappy Boys would do
I was planning taking a break
But you niggas done brought me out
You was making songs like crazy
Now it's a musicial drought
Now I got them versions on the lowest price around
Hundred thousand dollars for that T-Pain's sound (T-Pain's sound)

[Hook: Karaoke Sample]
Why you wanna do some shit I did in '03?
But don't act like you know...
I'm laying low key
Grab ya microphone
Set yo auto tune
And I'm a bust a verse on yo ass like I outta do
I got up out da streets so I ain't gotta steal
But listen to the radio it's obvious I still kill
Grab ya microphone
Set yo auto tune
And I'm a bust a verse on yo ass like I outta do

[Imitates Imitates E-40:]
Now I'm rappin like 40 (40)
Y'all niggas done got me pissed
Using a T-Pain effect in this vect till I get desked (Yes)
Now I'm on this blappin (blappin) I'm spitting the real speed (real speed)
That's to put my shit and all I wana do is kill B

[Imitates Soulja Boy:]
And now I'm Soulja Boy (YOOUUU)
You ain't know I'm on this song
You niggas need to gown on and leave T-Pain alone

[Imitates Shawty Lo:]

And even Shawty Lo got somethin to say (Damn)
Y'all niggas chill or we goin take ya back to the A
Dunn Dunn it all

[Imitates Young Jeezy:]
Aye, aye

Y'all niggas stealing Pain's shit, so Pain had to rap (Chyeah)
And I'm a co-sign for my nigga like that (YEAHH)

You know I keep the mossburg pump on the lap
(HA-HAW)

[Imitates Rick Ross:]
Ross

I ain't even help so he call me for back up (back up)
That big boss never slacks up
Ready for these pussy ass niggas try'na act up

[Imitates Lil Wayne / autotune:]
[Laughs]
Aooh, and Pain is the best
And Wayne is the next with that T-Pain effect
Y'all stealing, he cool
Cause he doing, what he do
Ha
I'm in that Styrofoam cup (cup)
And Pain drankin out of a dickie, you with me
He's on blacky mouse, I'm goin stick it
He got a wife, I need a bitch to lick me
Dippin ass nigga but the same dude
Don't worry bout a damn thing that T-Wayne do
T-Wayne cool, y'all niggas far behind...

[T-pain:]
And I be at the bar filling on a bar's behind (bitch)
As you can see I got my co-signers (co-signers)
Serve a nigga like an old school diner
Rapper turn singer turn producer turned rhymer
I'm at the bottom they ain't nothing to do but climb up

[Hook: Karaoke Sample]
Why you wanna do some shit I did in '03?

I'm laying low key
Grab ya microphone

But listen to the radio it's obvious I still kill
Grab ya microphone
Set yo auto tune
And I'm a bust a verse on yo ass like I outta do
