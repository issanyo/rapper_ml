[Pre-Chorus: SahBabii & T-Pain]
2 love to the mob
With a couple Capos and a hundred fuckin' Dons
Call up Slaughter Gang, you'll get your shit popped
Draco with a drum, this bitch ain't never gon' stop
We on that Nappy Boy shit, I'll slap your boy's bitch
If she actin' like she ain't had that Nappy Boy dick
I'm on that Nappy Boy shit, talkin' toy whips
Park that mothafucka sideways and let the choppa rip

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I might just pull up with a stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
I been with the shits, since a jit
I been with the shits, since a jit
I been with the shits, since a jit
Pull up with the stick
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Pull up on your bitch, she let me hit
She saw the whip, she know that I'm the shit
Took me to the crib, then she got up on that dick
Then she let me suck them titties right in front of your kid
I'ma pull up with bazookas, hit 'em from a mile away
Pull up with them packs and let my bitches take 'em out of state
Pull up with the MAC, I might just blow your fuckin' mind, okay?
Niggas hatin' on me in the club 'cause their diamonds fake
Yeah, bitch I'm the best and I know it
Yeah, you other niggas can't compete with me
Yeah, you love my style and you stole it
Basically niggas repeatin' me, yeah
Bitches smile in my face, yeah
I don't know why they be geekin' me, yeah
Bitch I'm busy gettin' to the bag
Get up in this Cadillac immediately, yeah

Mob shit, big sticks, get killed
Thought she was dancin' on the dick, that's the clip
We ain't gon' shoot up in the air, you gettin' hit
Just GF, we ain't clickin' up with shit
Got your hoe screaming "woah, woah, woah"
My verses ten, we ain't gon' fold, fold, fold
And you know we been having shit
All of these niggas is average
Swallow my dick just like a Brisk

So many blue strips, my pocket look like a crip
Throw it at peasants
Fuck nigga, have it
Oh I'm mobbin', you starvin'
You a victim, I'm robbin'

Pull in your hood with them rounds
My wrist is on a 10, I'm in that Benz
I let her get in, her and her friends
Loso Loaded comin' straight out the jungle
Loso Loaded comin' straight out the dirty
Loso Loaded get that check on the third
Loso Loaded get that check on the first
Crime paid, did the life that I chose

Burnin' rubber on a broke nigga dick
Pull up with a stick and I let it hit
