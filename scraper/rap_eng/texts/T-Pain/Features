[Hook: T-Pain (Yung Joc)]
Looking how she do that, do that, do that
Nigga so amazing, Nigga so amazing
The body says come here, come here
Booty say if you pay me, pay me
Good I've been watching her
Make sure,she knows just what I want
She a goldmine,She's so fine
Making everything unimportant coz she
(She look good, she knows
She look good, she feel good
She look good, she knows
She look good, she smell good
She look good, she knows
She look good, she feel good
She look good, she knows
She look good, she smell good)

[Verse 1: Yung Joc]
She look good, she pose
Confident in her shorts
Look good and she ain't scared to let the whole world know she knows
She mad like you THOTs
Ass fat she doing squats
Not much of a smoker
She drink the liquor straight upon the rocks
Now let me speak on the attitude
The way she expresses gratitude
Infatuated with no physical but I think I fall in love with her attitude
Of course she's attracted to finer things
The Aston Martin color cocaine
The Louis, the Gucci, the Balmain
If it's the designer, it's all the same
Got a smile that make a nigga melt
(*) from her Mama Nem
Got a tattoo of her grandparent on, she said she did that just to honor them
I get it, I get it I know her type
This would just might be the prototype
She said she've been on her ride all alone, ever I since did the motorbike

[Hook]


Just trying to say that I love how she's feeling
How she me kissing and touchin
She keeps her magic
Pretty good,my kids could look just like you
Am I right?
Put on the movie so I get an IPhone
She be killing these hoes, word
Staying, stayin low she might turn them
Nigga you should do that
Nigga you're so amazing
The body says come here
I've been watching you
Be sure ,baby , this is what I want
She don't mind
She's so fine
She looks good and she knows it
She looks good and she knows it
She looks good and she knows it
She looks good and she knows it
She looks good and she knows it
She looks good and she knows it
Nigga you should do that
Nigga you're so amazing
The body says come here
I've been watching you
Be sure, baby, this is what I want
She don't mind
She's so fine
