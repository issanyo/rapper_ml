{NAPPY BOY~!}

[Bow Wow]
Uh, see I know you got a man ma
But understand he can't do you like I can ma
And all I'm saying is just give the boy a chance ma
To lay you down I'll have you screaming like a fan ma
And yea the plan is not to treat you like a ho, but yo man ain't gotta know
Cause when it's summer time I can take you where it snow
And when it's winter time I can take you where it shine
So why settle for ripple when you could be having wine

[Hook: Bow Wow] + (Omarion)
I ain't tryna be rude, yea I know you gotta dude
But (He ain't gotta know about me)
See we can kick it in the states or switch countries to play it safe
Ya know? (Cause he ain't gotta know about me)
See I can come and put it down, when yo nigga ain't around
They like (He ain't gotta, he ain't gotta, he ain't gotta know about me)
Nah we ain't the same, I ain't saying he the lame
Uh-uh (He ain't gotta know about me)

[Bow Wow]
Look, see, you ain't gotta leave him
Be the nigga that you call when you need 'em, yep
And I'll be there for you when he start to switch on you
Play my role from the sideline like a benchwarmer
So sub me in, I ain't your man but we can just pretend
Hit the mall girl I got enough to spend
And you can go home to him I ain't hating him
Cause see you just my little secret that's escaping him

[Omarion]
He can be your man
I'm gonna be the one to take you out for dinner for two
And girl I understand
If he start acting up then I'll be there to comfort you
Shorty you know what it is
I can spend the night, but I gotta be gone by the morning
You ain't gotta talk to me, ain't gotta see me
Every now and then like an old friend

[Hook]

[Bow Wow]
Baby he ain't gotta know about the necklace
So waking up early to the four seasons breakfast
Cause that would screw it up like the homies down in Texas
And tell the truth I ain't the one he tryna mess with
So keep it on the down low or whatever you call it
Before the greatest sex will have me trapped in the closet nah
And like I said before girl look I'm not a hater
So if you win we can kick it like a soccer player

[Omarion:]
I can be your friend
Let me be the one to take you out for dinner for two
And girl I understand
And I`ll go right up out the back and ain't gotta worry about him catching you
Shorty you know what it is
Cause if I spend the night I gotta be gone by the morning
But everytime you talk to me, you wanna see me
Every now and then like an old friend

[Hook]

[Outro: Bow Wow]
I`m saying lil' mama he ain't gotta know about nothing that we do
Ya know what I`m sayin'? He ain't gotta know about the G5 trips
He ain't gotta know about the splurg on the black card
Up in Louis Vuttion and Gucci and all that
He ain't gotta know nothin' about that
None of that shit, ya know what I'm sayin'?
I'm sayin', I'm like a cold, I come and I go {*laughing*}
Yeah, uh-huh, yeah, let's ride
Bow Weezy, yep, O-eezy, I'm sayin'
Aye, Pain you a fool for this one homie
Haha, yeah
