[Verse 1]
You can tell she get something on her mind
It's real-life talking
She's done working tonight
She don't feel like walking in them shoes, oh, in them shoes
How could them dudes, oh, be so rude
She's been rethinking her life, said she wants some meaning
But I need her in my life
She know I mean it if I lose you what would I do?

[Hook]
Girl, I just wanna see you dance all night
All night, all night
She ain't even want no money, she dance all night
All night, all night
She said that she don't want nothing from me
Got your boy thinking 'bout getting in them pants
I just want to see you dance all night (all night, all night)
She do it for me, she dance all night

Party, caramba, fiesta, forever
Turn up, turn up
We going all night long
All night, all night long

[Verse 2]
Man, something's up with her tonight, she's so focused
She look me in my eyes, and said come closer
Is it you, ooh, is it you?
How do you move the way you do?
She just keep taking her time, it's like slow-motion
I can replay and rewind, and then fast-forward
If I could choose, ooh, if I could choose

[Hook]
Girl, I just wanna see you dance all night
All night, all night
She ain't even want no money, she dance all night
All night, all night
She said that she don't want nothing from me
Got your boy thinking 'bout getting in them pants
I just want to see you dance all night (all night, all night)
She do it for me, she dance all night

Party, caramba, fiesta, forever
Turn up, turn up
We going all night long
All night, all night long

[Bridge]
Hypnotize, mesmerize, can't believe my eyes
You got that ooh
Big surprise, hips and thighs
I love everything that you do
Hey, you got that aah-
And I need it right now
I want it right now
Got your boy thinking 'bout getting in them pants

[Hook]
I just wanna see you dance all night
All night, all night
She ain't even want no money, she dance all night
All night, all night
She said that she don't want nothing from me
Got your boy thinking 'bout getting in them pants
I just want to see you dance all night (all night, all night)
She do it for me, she dance all night

[Outro]
Got your boy thinking 'bout getting in them pants
I just want to see you dance all night
She dance all night
