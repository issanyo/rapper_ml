[Chorus: T-Pain]
I promise you ain't met a real one like me
Girl, I think I might let you be my wifey
Put some diamonds on your neck, girl have you icy
Or I might just spend a check, I'm still deciding
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Ooh I see niggas hatin', they wanna be like me
They wanna pull up in the Wraith outside just like me
She got a head on her shoulders
I'm thinkin' about puttin' bread down
Imma tear it up, you know it
Don't you get scared now
Ooh, bitch I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Ooh ooh, yeah
Ooh bitch I might be
On that poison ivy
In the club I'm sliding
Looking for a side piece that can
Take all my money from me
Come put that pussy on me
She go, we get some more hoes
She go get the money for me
I feel like Larry Flynt
Imma hustla baby
I might just pay your rent
Unless you fucking up baby
Cause I put that fur on your shoulders
Buy bitch a fuckin' safari
Diamonds all over your fingers
Drive off in a fuckin' Ferrari

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I promise you ain't met a real one like me
Girl, I think I might let you be my wifey
Put some diamonds on your neck, girl have you icy
Or I might just spend a check, I'm still deciding
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Ooh I see niggas hatin', they wanna be like me
They wanna pull up in the Wraith outside just like me
She got a head on her shoulders
I'm thinkin' about puttin' bread down
Imma tear it up, you know it
Don't you get scared now
Ooh, bitch I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I done got rich, but I'm trying to be wealthy
Wrist so healthy, watch so chunky
I'm getting cocky, bright wrist yachty
Run like Philly, but I feel like Rocky
Niggas be blocking, never really like me
Heard he want to fight me, I'm not Rocky
Yeah, it's Wop, [?]
Show you the drip then I gave you the mop
Feel the [?], hate in a jar
Camo pico bitch you married the mall
Say what I wanna, go where I wanna
Try to rob Wop, bitch you'll die in the jungle
If I am the last real one they'll leave me alone
Medusa my love, so they turn into stone
Pass her the bone, covered with stones
House is so big that we kick it at home
Wop

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I promise you ain't met a real one like me
Girl, I think I might let you be my wifey
Put some diamonds on your neck, girl have you icy
Or I might just spend a check, I'm still deciding
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Ooh I see niggas hatin', they wanna be like me
They wanna pull up in the Wraith outside just like me
She got a head on her shoulders
I'm thinkin' about puttin' bread down
Imma tear it up, you know it
Don't you get scared now
Ooh, bitch I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
Bitch, I might be
