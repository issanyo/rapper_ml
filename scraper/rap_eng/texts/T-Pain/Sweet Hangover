[Intro]
Ha-ha-ha (Aooh)
[?] her legs
Oooohh wooo-ahhh, yeah
Omarion

[Verse 1]
I see your shoulder dipping
And you lookin' so good tonight
Mmm... and you lovin' it
Girl I ain't tryna put up a fight (Fight)
I wanna look you in the eye
Say I wanna bang it out
Baby I ain't in love
I just wanna hear you shout, all night
Till the morning
And have you feeling good
When I leave you with a sweet hangover

[Chorus]
Hangover (Hangover, Hangover)
Baby I'm leaving  you
Ooh with a sweet hangover
Hangover (Hangover, Hangover)
Just the way I like, I'm so excited
So I run the streets
You still thinking of me
While you under the sheets
Watchin' TV with a sweet hang-, hang-, hang- (Hey, yeah, ay)
Ay hey yeah, sweet hangover

[Verse 2]
You say you like it
When everybody come holla at you
Like it's your birthday
And everybody's throwin' dollars at you
You so with it, so whoever goes home
Is gon' get it
That's why I looked you in the eye
Said I wanna bang it out
She said go and get your car boy
We gon' sweat it out, all night
Till the moring
And have you feeling good
When I leave you with a sweet hangover

[Chorus]
Hangover (Hangover, Hangover)
Baby I'm leaving  you
Ooh with a sweet hangover
Hangover (Hangover, Hangover)
Just the way I like, got me so excited
So I run the streets
You still thinking of me
While you under the sheets
Watchin' TV with a sweet hang-, hang-, hang- (Hey, yeah, ay)
Ay hey yeah, sweet hangover

[Verse 3]
Wakin' up early, you can hardly remember last night
(Oooh with a sweet hang-)
And you took it off, no need for Tylenol
It just had you feelin' right
You said you never thought you could feel it-feel it
This way before
As if you was high and tipsy
You need me more and more
Turnin' around, lookin' refusing to let it go
Sayin' baby when the next time you givin' me... a sweet hangover

[Chorus]
Hangover (Hangover, Hangover)
Cause I wanna give it to you
Ooh with a sweet hangover
Hangover (Hangover, Hangover)
Just the way I like, I'm excited
So I run the streets
You still thinking of me
While you under the sheets
Watchin' TV with a sweet hang-, hang-, hang- (Hey, yeah, ay)
Ay hey yeah, sweet hangover

[Outro]
Hangover (Hangover, Hangover)
Hangover (Hangover, Hangover)
So I run the streets
You still thinking of me
While you under the sheets
Watchin' TV with a sweet hang-, hang-, hang- (Hey, yeah, ay)
Sweet Hangover
