Konvict Muzic... it's time to do it
I can't handle all these bills and payments
This stuff is overstressin me (but I still gotta do it)
Baby mama put me on them papers and get nothing for the baby (but I still gotta do it)
I can't keep on working, (keep on working)
Seems like the whole world's ignoring me (but I still gotta do it)
Schemers keep on dirking (keep on dirking)
Everybody's getting more than me (but I still gotta do it)

[Chorus]
So pass that drag, pass that dro, it's my life
So what you think, what you know?
Yes all right and I paid the price, but still I'm
Going thru a lot, sittin on the block now
Thru a lot, slangin out my drop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
Going thru a lot, I'm hittin on the cops now
Thru a lot, wishin they would stop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not

[T-Pain]
All this music got me going crazy
Can't even concentrate on my family (but I still gotta do it)
Plus I gotta go thru all this family hatred
I don't know why everybody's hatin me (but I still gotta do it)
Even one of my homeboys thinking that I'm bangin his lady
I don't know why he would think that outta me (but he gotta go thru it)
To all the nappy headz I got you baby
We bout make it yes indeed (and we gon get thru it)

[Chorus]
[Bone Crusher]
I work a nine to five shawty and they think it's funny
And how they feel that my stress don't count homie
I hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block
Because my baby's gotta eat, I ain't gon never stop
I see them laughin at me fo cuz my pants red
And my do' won't shut and my car's shabby
But I see the future man like I'm nostradamus
And in my heart all I see is a future star
But in my brain ain't nothing but these notes man
But ya'll don't feel my stress ya'll don't understand
The next step is my pistol and it goes down
Wiggle it out fat boy just calm down
And sing this song, and sing that song
Cause god gon make a way for me to get my hustle on

[T-Pain]
Going thru a lot, sittin on the block now
Thru a lot, slangin out my drop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
Going thru a lot, I'm hittin on the cops now
Thru a lot, wishin they would stop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
[x2]
Going thru a lot, thru a lot, thru a lot
Going thru a lot, thru a lot, thru a lot
