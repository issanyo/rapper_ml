She got me doin da dishes
Anythang she want for some kisses
I'm cookin for her when she gets hungry
All she do is actin like she want me
She cuttin off all my homies
Even all'a my other ronnies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinking 'bout it lately
She really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everything with me
Well it all come down and

I'm Sprung

So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody telling me what I'm gon do
And I'm feeling so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All'a my fellas can I get a witness
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
Man I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everythang with me
Well i come down and

I'm Sprung...
Dawg she Got Me
Got me doin things I'll never do If u ain't been I'm tellin you
