[Intro]
So me a say

T-Pain!

[Verse 1: Vybz Kartel]
That boy get sprung!
Boop! Hook!
Aww, she makes him clean and wash and cook
Crook!
She use every trick inna the book
'Bout, "Honey, me love you", a something she a look
Pack up you clothes! Grab your bankbook
Walk out now, right foot, left foot
T-Pain (mmm)
Kartel (yeah!)
Tell these missies, this is no genie fi wishes

[Verse 2: T-Pain (Vybz Kartel)]
Oooh
She got me doin the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses (Wha'?!)
I'm cooking for her out when she gets hungry
All she doin is actin' like she want me (A lie!)
She cuttin' off all of my homies
Even all a my other ronnies
She ain't even my main lady (Wha'?!)
See, I've been thinkin' bout it lately (Wha' you a say?)
And she really don't deserve me (No!)
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her (Cut!)

[Bridge: T-Pain (Vybz Kartel)]
But now i'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me (Well...)
And I'm taking everything with me (Ha! Ha!)
(But it all come down to..)

[Chorus: T-Pain (Vybz Kartel)]
I'm sprung!
How she got me (How she got you?)
Got me doing things I'd never do
If you ain't real, I'm telling you
I'm sprung! (Spring?)
How she got me
Got me doin' things i'd never do
If you ain't real, I'm telling you
You do (No I don't...)
You do (I'm tellin' you, I don't)
You do (Never will)
You do (You know it's Kartel)
You do (So me a say)
You do, You do, You do, you doooo
You do, You do, You do, you doooo
I don't
I just won't

[Verse 3: Vybz Kartel]
Hey!
T-Pain!
Wash which panty?!
Me nah wash no bra!
Nah!
That no inna badman law
You say you want me, but it's a clown you want
She no have nothing pon me as a thug
'Cause, no gyal no lucky so, not even if she win the Lotto draw
You can't clown me fi the pussy jaw!
A Kartel you know
Baby! Tell me wha' you want
Or, syonara, au revoir

[Verse 4: T-Pain]
So, we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody telling me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feeling so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But, I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her

[Hook: T-Pain]
But, now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm taking everything with me
Well it all come down to her

[Chorus]
I'm sprung
Now that she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm telling you
I'm sprung
(I'm sprung)
Now that she got me
Got me doin' things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin' you

[Outro]

Do do do, do do
(You do)
Do do do, do do
(You do)
Do, do do, do do do
(You do)

Do do do, do do
(You do)
Do do do, do do
(You do)
Do, do do, do do do
