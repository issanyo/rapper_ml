[Verse 1: Elle Varner]
I feel like the girl at the bar who’s been there too long
Can’t stand up!
I should be gone but I just can’t get enough, yeah!
Fumbling, giggling, silly as ever I get like this after one too many
But right now I ain’t even been drinkin'
He approached me and asked for a minute
Which turned into five, then turned into ten
And right now I don’t know how to say when

[Hook:Elle Varner]
So can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Yeah, of your time
Cause you’re intoxicating my mind
Feel like a conversational lush
Cause I don’t know how much is too much, yeah

[T-Pain]
I feel like the dude at the bar that then had couple nuvo's
And 'bout to order 2 more, ready
I'm ready for the love, I'm ready for the touch, I'm ready for the kisses
I just can't get enough, it is what it is this is what i've been missing
You know what we doing we can get the party moving
Ain't nobody gonna stop us
People too nibble
If you feelin' what I'm feelin' I'mma give it to you proper
Oh, round two (round two)
Me and you (me and you)
My feelin' let it, yet another word (another word)
Baby, you know what I'm 'bout to do
I hope you ain't through
Cause I ain't nowhere near done
So baby can I get re..?
Yeah I'm lovin' it, pa pam pam pam pam
Gonna take these
Shots shots shots shots shots
Make your booty go
Pam pam pam pam pam
Girl I'm trying to get my hand prints all on that derier
Are you ready for T-Pain, to give youuyeah
Your time, cause you're intoxicating my mind
Feel like a conversational lush
Cause I don't know how much is too much yeah
I feel like the girl at the bar who's been there too long, can't stand up
I need a shot of you on the rocks cause I'm down to my very last drop

[Hook:Elle Varner]
So can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Can I get a refill?
Yeah, of your time
Cause you’re intoxicating my mind
Feel like a conversational lush
Cause I don’t know how much is too much, yeah

[Wale]
Look, she love my honesty and I love her decency
And I call her queen and she calls me frequently
She ain't easy when I leave she said she need a piece of me
And I got me startin' to feel like i'll never meet her needs
Absence makes the heart broke
Even if that, it's only part true
When I leave I'm out, I walk slow
Any quicker i'd probly leave your heart broke
And girl I know you've been lonely but I be after that dough cheese
When i'll be still I bet you'll be there
To get your refill but don't o.d
No days off and I won't sleep
All my shows with a jones beat
You've been too timid if I cut through chicken
I can see your goose bumps through your long sleeves
I can tell that she feelin' it, (heh)
There you, bitin' your lip again
Studderin' gigglin'
Tryin' to conceal it but when I get in your head I get you outta your element
Lot of bad chicks, she ain't here though
Great convo, better sex though
I ain't sayin' that it's all a brotha need but I'm lookin' for a speed that's better than my ex boat
The relationship that is
Let me paint the picture miss
Conversational lush, told the waiter to hold up
You ain't drinkin' enough
Wale, dough
