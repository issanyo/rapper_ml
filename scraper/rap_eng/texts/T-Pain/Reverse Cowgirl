Welcome to my rodeo
Hold on, to meeeeee
Baby I will take it slow
How you ride, is the keyyyyy
You're gonna go left, right, front, back - and nooooo
That just ain't, that-that just ain't, that - that just ain't enough
I can take you everywhere, all around the world
I like how you do it, just put it in reverse cowgirl

[Hook: T-Pain]
(Giddy up, giddy up) Pump it up girl (sit it up, sit it up)
Cause I like how you do it, just put it in reverse cowgirl
(Giddy up, giddy up) Rope it up girl (sit it up, sit it up)
I like how you do it, do it, do it
Just put yo' hands in the air
Wave 'em round and go yeeeee-hawwwwww (yeeeee-hawwwwww)
Put yo' hands in the air
Wave 'em round and go yeeeee-hawwwwww (yeeeee-hawwwwww, girl)

[T-Pain]
Baby let me rope you up
Tie you down, do it riiiiiight
No matter how hard you buck
Gon' get wild, all niiiiiight
You're gonna go left, right, front, back - and nooooo
That just ain't, that-that just ain't, that-that just ain't enough
I can take you everywhere, all around the world
I like how you do it, just put it in reverse cowgirl
