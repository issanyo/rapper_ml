[Intro: Cardi B, T-Pain & 21 Savage]
Bardi in a 'Rari, (ooh) diamonds all over my body, (ohh)
(30, you a fool for this one)
Shinin' all over my body
Bardi, put that lil' bitch on molly, Bardi
Pizzle
Bitch on Molly (Cheeze)
Ooh
21, diamonds all over (ooh) my body
Fucked that bitch on molly (Ooh) (KSR)
Ask him if I'm 'bout it
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I pull up in the party in a 'Rari
Hoppin' out a 'Rari with your shawty
My other bitch pull up on a Harley
My other bitch smokin' on Marley
Fuck a bitch, sorry, not sorry
Bitch, you know Pain, I'm game
That's in the game, now I'm chained
Fuck all the fame
Blow out the brains on game
I drop the house on the chains
Still got my feet up on planes
The rims on the Chevy got a offset
Shoutout to the young boy, Offset
Ain't no more hatin', we been off that
Lil niggas gotta crawl, can't walk yet
Still on my dick like a nutsack
Still, make a bitch push her butt back
Still makin' deals on WhatsApp
Still, in the field, nigga, bust back

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Who told niggas they not ready? (Teddy)
Who put them thangs on that Chevy? (Teddy)
Who got your bitch in the Wisconsin mansion
And eatin' chicken wings off my belly? (Teddy)
Who put that dick on her forehead? (Teddy)
Who she be beggin' for more head? (Teddy)
I hit that shit from the back
Now she lookin' back at a nigga like, go ahead, Teddy
Ooh, your baby, I be crushin' it (oh)
Ooh, your baby, she be lovin' it (oh)
I tell her go fuck with them other niggas
Have 'em wonderin' where all they 100s went
I put that shit in my wallet, bitch
My Gucci gon' fuck round and swallow it
We do it again and again, nigga, I ain't got no friends
I just tell these niggas that it's politics

[Chorus: T-Pain]
I pull up in the party in a 'Rari
Hoppin' out a 'Rari with your shawty
My other bitch pull up on a Harley
My other bitch smokin' on Marley
Fuck a bitch, sorry, not sorry
Bitch, you know Pain, I'm game
That's in the game, now I'm chained
Fuck all the fame
Blow out the brains on game
I drop the house on the chains
Still got my feet up on planes
The rims on the Chevy got a offset
Shoutout to the young boy, Offset
Ain't no more hatin', we been off that
Lil niggas gotta crawl, can't walk yet
Still on my dick like a nutsack
Still, make a bitch push her butt back
Still makin' deals on WhatsApp
Still, in the field, nigga, bust back
