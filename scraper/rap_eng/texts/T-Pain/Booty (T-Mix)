Bounce that booty on the floor (shake)
Shake it 'til you get a lil sore (shake)

Shake that booty, can I lay on the booty?
Mike Tyson on the booty

[Verse 3: Young Cash]
If I see that out, be your one and only
Promise, promise, I will never leave that booty lonely
I wouldn't cheat with that booty, it's big, what to do with that booty?
Make me a mill like that booty, put a lil pill in that booty
We rolling in the strip club, swerving my car
Like it's stolen, she's sitting on my lap with all of these ones
My dick growing, tell the barmaid to bring another drink
And keep pouring, just keep pouring
Tryna get that booty drunk (drunk)
She say you got me lit (got me lit)
Weed and straight Hennessy
None of that Bill Cosby shit
And you're bouncing that booty so good
I just might make you my main thot (my thot)
That booty so round and soft
I could kill that if it's fake, girl, or not, that booty

[Chorus: Blac Youngsta]
(Twerk twerk), twerk
Girl I wanna see you twerk
I'll throw a lil money if you twerk
I don't really think you can twerk
(Twerk twerk), twerk
If you broke, go to work
Make that big booty twerk
Make that big booty twerk
(Twerk twerk)
Can I touch that booty?
That booty, that big old booty?
Shake that booty, can I lay on the booty?
Mike Tyson on the booty
