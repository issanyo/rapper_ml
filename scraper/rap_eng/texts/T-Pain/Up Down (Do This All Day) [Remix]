[Verse 1: B.o.B]
Pull up to the scene in an all white bucket
Way too high and I’m way too blunted (fuck it)
Fucked your bitch, told that ho she could suck it
Even in a knife fight, bitch couldn't cut it
Young fresh nigga, I’m Grey Pouponin’
Watch so sick, Father Time might vomit
If I ain't the flyest then I ain't far from it
And if you gotta hold her hand that tight, that ain’t your woman
That’s everyone woman, community pussy
You new to the game, you make moves like a rookie
I stick to the script, you be thumbin’ right through it
I do it, I do it, I do it
She give it to me, I’m ‘bout to lose it
Pussy so wet, I’mma need a canoe or a cruise ship
She said "Is it good?" and I said "Absolutely"
Now light up that doobie like Shaggy and Scooby

[Hook: T-Pain]
I ain’t even know they made a remix to it
Baby, let me see you do it
Stacks so big can’t see nothing through it
Money gonna flow like fluid
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain’t nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what’s up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way
Word on the streets, I’mma kill this
Hangin' with the niggas on a remix
Top down with the weed lit
Ain’t nobody fucking with me, bitch
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain’t nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what’s up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way

[Verse 2: Kid Ink]
Kid Ink, ugh
I’m sitting in the back of the ‘Lac
Pull up to the club in a back front pack
Going straight to the back section, low slack
My track goin’ boom boom
Club filled with a whole lot of poom poom
Better cuff your chick or she is doomed
In this bitch with the platoon now
It's shots going round, rotating with a ass, same time
Can’t help but stare, I feel like a dog, canine
Now, now, ain't my table rocking like a seance?
Booty’s going up, down but you know I stay high, ha

[Hook: T-Pain]
I ain’t even know they made a remix to it
Baby, let me see you do it
Stacks so big can’t see nothing through it
Money gonna flow like fluid
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain’t nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what’s up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way
Word on the streets, I’mma kill this
Hangin' with the niggas on a remix
Top down with the weed lit
Ain’t nobody fucking with me, bitch
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain’t nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what’s up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way

[Verse 3: Lil Boosie]
Word on the street, I’mma kill this
I’m the illest, girl, come suck me now
Finger in her booty hole
Watch how that thing go up and down
I ain't even know if it was real, but it clapped the K.O.D way
Just got out, I stay on hard, girl, I could do this all day
Earthquake, earthquake, earthquake, earthquake
Now shake it like you thirsty
So I remixed and her homegirl
And wished ‘em happy birthday
Money real long and the weed lit (smell that?)
All I really want is a freak chick
So jump in this drop top, make it pop lock
Cause it's G shit on the remix, Boosie

[Hook: T-Pain]
I ain’t even know they made a remix to it
Baby, let me see you do it
Stacks so big can’t see nothing through it
Money gonna flow like fluid
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain’t nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what’s up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way
Word on the streets, I’mma kill this
Hangin' with the niggas on a remix
Top down with the weed lit
Ain’t nobody fucking with me, bitch
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain’t nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what’s up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way

[Verse 4: T-Pain]
Still doing what I do best
Shots fired when I spit hot fire
Got a pussy nigga running wearing two vests
I’m not lying, you can go on, stop trying
And they hate it when I love it, love it when I fall
Tell your girl to come and she gon’ love the way I ball
Put a hundred on it, later she’ll be giving me a call
Cause she done told my lady she don’t fuck with you at all, nah
I throw a stack in the air
I don’t give a fuck, nigga, I’mma make it right back
I get it crackin’ in here
Give me fifty feet, nigga, you don't know me like that
I’m way too faded and I’m way too raw
So baby you gonna take it up down - or nah?

[Hook: T-Pain]
I ain’t even know they made a remix to it
Baby, let me see you do it
Stacks so big can’t see nothing through it
Money gonna flow like fluid
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain’t nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what’s up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way
Word on the streets, I’mma kill this
Hangin' with the niggas on a remix
Top down with the weed lit
Ain’t nobody fucking with me, bitch
Booty going up, down
Girl, this ain’t nothing, I can do this all day
Trying to see what’s up now
Thicker than a snicker, shawty bring it my way
