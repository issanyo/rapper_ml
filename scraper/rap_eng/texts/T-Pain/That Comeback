[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Aye
Bands on
Aye, ooh
Ooh really wanna come see you
I can't stop thinking 'bout the night, night, night
Ooh you got that voodoo
Girl you give me life, life life
Ooh you pick my heart up from the floor
Shawty I see the light
I knew from the start I wanted more
This just feels so right
Ooh, I'm so blue to you, what did you do?
This could be us, you got control over me
Girl this some voodoo do, what did you do?
This could be us, how'd you get this hold on me

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Girl you hit it, admit it, you got me coming back
You got that comeback pussy
Girl you did it, admit it, you got me coming back
You got that comeback pussy
You got that comeback (comeback baby)
Comeback (Can I comeback baby)
Comeback (I just can't get enough)
Comeback (Can I comeback baby)
Comeback (I think that I'm in love)

[Verse 2: Ne-yo]
I told her I was sure you got that comeback
Not sure if that's the case
Don't know (don't know)
Don't know (don't know)
Don't know (What you know?)
All I know is that that thang is so good you make it hard to leave the crib in the first place
We come back it found me
Everybody calling, textin' me
Cause ain't nobody seen me in a week
I got responsibilities and I should act responsibly
But every time you look at me
We end up right back in them sheets
And the song sets on
On to the next night, night, night (Night, night, night)
Ooh, I'm addicted somebody fix my life, life, life (Life, life, life)
Why would I ever go outside, side, side (Side, side, side)
Every time you turn around I just go my, my, my
Oh, my my my

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Girl you hit it, admit it, you got me coming back
You got that comeback pussy
Girl you did it, admit it, you got me coming back
You got that comeback pussy
You got that comeback (comeback baby)
Comeback (Can I comeback baby)
Comeback (I just can't get enough)
Comeback (Can I comeback baby)
Comeback (I think that I'm in love)
