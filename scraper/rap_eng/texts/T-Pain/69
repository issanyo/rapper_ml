[Intro: T-Pain]
In the back of my 'Lac and with the suicide doors
Ehh, uh-huh, hahaha
T-Pain, J-Lyriq, Nappy Boy
Hit me on my hotline, I am so lonely now
So as I.. ohhh, lowwww
Baby that is alright with me
YEAH! (Y'all know you gotta clap your hands to this mayne)
In the back of my Lan-coln with the suicide doors
(C'mon clap this one of my classics)
(Don't act like you don't know)
(Oh man, it's indiverous)
Baby that is alright with me

[T-Pain]
I know you waitin fo' daddy it won't be long shawty
Be patient cause I'm flyin to you
Ridin dirty down Orange Avenue
Maybe I'm comin after you to do a 69 with you
Baby girl - I've been doin tongue exercises
And girl - I'm thinkin 'bout that booty and them thighs
And them curls - you know that I love your brown hair
I got you up here, you just handle me shawty

[Hook]
Baby, let's do a 69 in the back of my Lincoln with the suicide doors
Sayin' time for a 69, baby that is alright with me
Baby let's do a 69 (shawty)
Hit me on my hotline, while I'mma slob on the 9
So that's a soft, 69, baby that is alright with me

[J-Lyriq]
I know you want it baby, I'm sorry to keep you waitin
Don't worry I'mma do what I do
Got me zoomin all in this rain, tryin to find where you stay
To put this 69 on you
Girl I got plans, to use my hands, and I ain't playin wit'chu
I'mma give it to you straight rub from front to back shawty side to side
Go down on me baby then show me how you ride
[Hook]

[T-Pain]
When she was suckin on me, well I was lickin on her
I got so into it, I spreaded that booty so wide
I can tell that she was with it by the look in her eyes
When I was kissin on her, and she was suckin on me
I just wanted to get into it, cause shawty got so into it
I'm glad that she do it for free (shawty)

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Outro]
Yeah yeah yeah
