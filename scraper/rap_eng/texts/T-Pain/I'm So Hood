DJ Khaled We're The Best
Who We Nigga
We're The Best
The Winner I Represent The Ghetto Across The World
And You Represent The Hood Two Hands In The Sky

[Chorus:]
I'm So Hood (Listen)
I Wear My Pants Below My Waist
And I never dance when I'm in this place
'Cause You And Your Man Is Planning To Hate (I'm So Hood)
And I Got These Golds Up In My Mouth If You Get Closer To My House Then You Know What I'm Taking about I'm Out The Hood
And If You Feel Me Put Your Hands Up (hood) My Hood Of Niggas Can You Stand Up (I'm So Hood)
If You're Not From Here You Can Walk It Out And You Not Hood Then You Don't Know What I'm Talking about

Everybody Wanna Motherfucking Know Why I Dress So Fly Sit So High (Bitch)
I Do It For The Hood
Bitch Ass Niggas I Do It 'Cause I Could
Heavy starch On My Jeans 4X On My White Tee
Living Life Like A G That's Why These Bitch Ass Niggas Wanna Fight Me
But I ain't Going Play With 'Em
Nu Uh Brother Left To AK Hit 'Em
Tough Niggas Get Fucked Up
And Put On Ice For The Rest Of They Life
I'm Straight Out The Hood Bra
See That's What I Do It For
My Low Class Ghetto Ass
Just Renewed My Ghetto Ass

[Chorus]
Ross Yeah 4 5 Off In the Ride
Four blunts For Me To Get High
Feel Buck When I Ride By (I'm So Hood)

Niggas Keep Dropping Like Flies
Snitching Ain't Going Cut No Time (I'm So Hood)
I Murder One Of You Fuck Niggas

For Money For Mahem For Yayo And Millions
I Made 'Em, The Mayblock Is Mine, The City Is Mine (I'm so Hood)

[Chorus]
Damn my P O You all Can Tell her I Said It
Violate me if She wants, she's Gonna Have To Come Catch Me
Piss Test Me All You Want, I'm gonna Smoke When I'm Ready
Pants Hanging Off Me Now 'cause My Pistol Heavy (Hood)
I Ain't Spoke To You Yet Dawg, 'Cause I Ain't Friendly
I drank Yak homie, you all drink Cris
I Like Pussy Handy I Want That Boogie Bitch
I Never Buy A Phantom 28's Can't Fit
They Say I'm fed bound, They Call Me high risk
My Four Bloody Goon, Lanes Make Me Sick

I'd Like To Thank The Hood Homie Is All Behind Me
