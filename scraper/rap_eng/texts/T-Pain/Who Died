Somebody tell me who died
And made you boss
I put it all aside, yeah
There wasn't a dry eye in the house
Nobody cried (nobody cried)
When I lost
And I learned everything that day

[Hook]
I just wanna say
Thank you, I thank you
I appreciate it, I appreciate it
I came up
Now he hate it, now she hate it
I just wanna say
Thank you, I thank you
I appreciate it, I appreciate it
I got the bag now
Now he hate it (hey!), now she hate it
I just wanna say!
I'm doing good, I'm doing good (yeah!)
Everything is still everything, I did everything I said I would (ooh)
I just wanna say
I'm doing good, I'm doing good (yeah!)
Everything is still everything, I did everything I said I would

[Verse]
I hit the billboards with a baseball bat
Hit after hit, so I understand why you don't wanna face all that
I been with the shits
My track record looking like I got baseball stats
Roger Clements with the pitch
Now these niggas busy trynna erase all that
Ain't that a bitch? (boot!)
I did everything for the culture
At gun point, with the mask off
But I ain't cry about it, I ain't lie about it
I just kept working my ass off
Now all of a sudden everybody figured out what I was sayin' back in '05
The whip ain't shit if the nigga in the driver seat ain't got no drive
If you ain't call me when you fly nigga
Don't call me when you in a nose dive
'Cause I remember all that Twitter shit
I thought you said that it was your time
Just sit back while I get my shit back
And tell these niggas that it's showtime

[Pre-hook]
Somebody tell me who died
And made you boss
I put it all aside, yeah

Thank you, I thank you
I appreciate it, I appreciate it

Now he hate it, now she hate it
I just wanna say
Thank you, I thank you

Now he hate it (hey!), now she hate it
