[Hook]
One day niggas gone learn not to fuck with me
The heater on my side, I’ll burn me a fuck nigga
Fuck nigga, I got trust issues, I don’t really trust niggas
You only got one life to live, might as well turn up nigga

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Better duck nigga, unless you got a bulletproof truck nigga
Cause you the only one throwing money in the club
You the only one that’s gone be stuck nigga
Your ass out of luck nigga, tryna stunt but you’re stunting too much nigga
And my face just way too pretty
So I ain’t tryna punch niggas
What’s up nigga?
Everything cool right now but it could go left
So I don’t trust niggas, no niggas, I don’t even trust myself
It get deeper, mama said y’all niggas don’t give a fuck till the crew hot
And I believe her
One of these days you niggas gonna try to take me out like 2Pac

[Hook]
One day niggas gone learn not to fuck with me
The heater on my side, I’ll burn me a fuck nigga
Fuck nigga, I got trust issues, I don’t really trust niggas
You only got one life to live, might as well turn up nigga

[Verse 2: Young Cash]
I done laid in a niggas bushes 3 whole days and 3 whole nights
Just served that boy a whole thing but I got to get my shit byke(back)
I got trust issues, I don’t fuck with you, nigga might be them federals
So I serve a nigga then rob a bank, hit the strip club then blow a check at Follies
[?] nigga on G code, since serving out the trap out the peephole
Got a sawed off shotty and an automatic weapon
On the couch sitting there like it’s legal
And no nigga, I am no Migo
I’m a Florida nigga and you can get your issue
And I don’t even trust you niggas in my dreams
So you know a nigga still sleeping with the pistol
Like that!

[Hook]
One day niggas gone learn not to fuck with me
The heater on my side, I’ll burn me a fuck nigga
Fuck nigga, I got trust issues, I don’t really trust niggas
You only got one life to live, might as well turn up nigga

[Verse 3: Sean Jay]
I’m ahead of my time, and everybody late
Ain’t nobody real, everybody fake
I’m a diamond in the rough man, you just fugazi
Smoke can't stand me, Ludacris hate me
Nappy Boy shit, we make bread
Cut a nigga off like T-Pain’s dreads
If Cash don’t like you, I don’t fuck with you
99 percent of these boys fuck niggas
And 99 percent of these rappers nowadays is gay
On the low they probably fuck niggas
And that’s where you lost me
Before I trust niggas I’d rather take prescription pills from Bill Cosby
Two words for you, blucka! blucka!
Clique tighter than pants on Thugger Thugger
Then get robbed, see them killers in the masks
You ain’t on this song, got a bullet for your ass like

[Hook]
One day niggas gone learn not to fuck with me
The heater on my side, I’ll burn me a fuck nigga
Fuck nigga, I got trust issues, I don’t really trust niggas
You only got one life to live, might as well turn up nigga
