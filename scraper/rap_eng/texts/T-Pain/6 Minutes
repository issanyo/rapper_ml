[Verse 1: The-Dream]
I'm tired of hearing you talking that shit on my phone
I'm getting in my car and heading straight to your home
And I'm throwing on that ski mask, ski mask
Never mind when your man at home
Finna kill it, kill it, I'mma dead that babe, feel it, feel it, I'm ready baby
You've been all in my head like a headache and now I'mma make that bed shake
I'm on my way, already girl I'm on my way

[Hook: T-Pain]
All I need is 6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes and we gon' be on

[Verse 2: The-Dream]
Tonight I'm gonna be your everything, so don't stop it drop it, don't stop it drop it oh
And I'm gon' sparkles and turn to flames, gon' shawty get it get it get it

[Verse 3: Twista]
I'm on fleek, I wanna hit it
She told me to come over cause she wanted me to come and get it
Feel her over your shoulder and she wanna see your phone with it
So to get it over quick and be committed like
6 minutes, dug her fresh you on
And I got Twista the best the song cause I spit it like I was a bullet
Gimme the address to your home
So when I'm there I can address the throne like
Remember when I saw you with your dude and you was chilling in the club?
And yes you was the baddest one in the place, exquisite taste
Niggas all in your face
Until I hooked you with some bottles of Ace like
Now I got you asking me to come over so I can show you love
You horny and you want me to come pay you a visit
So I can hit it, I admit it
Got the pedal to the metal while pushing it to the limit cause

[Hook: T-Pain]
All I need is 6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes and we gon' be on
6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes and we gon' be on
6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes and we gon' be on
6 minutes, 6 minutes, 6 minutes and we gon' be on
We 'bout to be on, we 'bout to be on
