[Verse 1]
I didn't have diamonds in my chain
That Chevy horn sounded like a train
We made a movie
And I was so proud of my address
Repping Ridge Road deep down
Four doors on the Chevy

[Pre-Hook]
Cause every song was like
Nappy head, smoke, drank, Tallahassee, what's up?
Moon on Wednesday, nigga fill the truck up
We don't care, look at all these Cadillacs on 20s
And every song was like
"Work hard, play hard"  "Money over everything"
Cowboy hat and a hubcap for the chain
We don't care, started from the bottom, now we're here

[Hook 1]
Seems like yesterday we was drinking Crown Royal
We ain't really give a fuck
Now they try to hate on us
And I just party on my bus
Let me see you get loose, girl
Everything is on me
So, nigga, come through
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2: Young Cash]
I represent that 904 (Duval County)
And every weekend you can catch me in the runnings
And everybody who know me know
That I rep the Win Squad
And them niggas getting money

[Pre-Hook 2]
Them niggas used to say
"There go Young Cash tippin' in that Ace 2"
T-Pain call my phone, telling me to come through
But I don't care cause never ever did I dream
That Teddy Pain would grow up and now we makin' millions
Got enough money to take care of our children
And I don't care, cause we came from nothing

[Hook 2]
And most niggas ain't loyal (loyal)
My dog came back for me (came back for me)
He got me off on XRC
When I was still movin' keys
When a nigga went to prison
Everybody turned their backs on me
But it's cool
Young Cash gon keep it G

[Hook 1]
