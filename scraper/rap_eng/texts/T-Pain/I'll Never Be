Hey, all I want is cooperation from you
You ain't got much time, it's almost over
Uh, don't mess up the operation in this room
Baby, just send why, I'm almost over!

Chorus:
I'll be rolling every where I go, I talk that back
That it's on, put them records up real high
You're about to get fucked up tonight, right
And after party I've been joking
Cause I know they're looking, yeah, yeah
And I'm so hot!

Oh, can't get the spot
And I can't believe you ain't gonna drink non with me
Alright, believe or not
Yours it must be, oh yes indeed
Girl, I can't walk away
And I'll never be the same again
I've been wondering what if I had stayed
Oh, you can talk to me and just ask me for my name again
And try this brand new drink that I made

Chorus:
I'll be rolling every where I go, I talk that back
That it's on, put them records up real high
You're about to get fucked up tonight, right
And after party I've been joking
Cause I know they're looking, yeah, yeah
And I'll be so hot, wish that I wasn't so
So misunderstood, oh, oh, misunderstood, oh, oh
It's either now or never
I'll never be so fucked up again!

I ain't even this bitch till I'm seeing double
Two pimps between two chicks with a couple of...
Loose lips,... The trouble
... And it's over for you!
Cause what happens here stays here
Or I'll be more than happy to let you live here
Now stop playing and pass that
Now adapt other brat that you came with
Oh, you're beasting homie
It's planning to go round
Why you're beating, homie?
It all started with a sip of muscato
Then the sip turned into a whole bottle
And that's when broke hoes start looking like fucking models
Even if they say there ain't no...
Then that's a b you l l shit
If that's the case, I'mma find a plug and plug in!

Chorus: (x2)
I'll be rolling every where I go, I talk that back
That it's on, put them records up real high
You're about to get fucked up tonight, right
And after party I've been joking
Cause I know they're looking, yeah, yeah
And I'll be so hot, wish that I wasn't so
So misunderstood, oh, oh, misunderstood, oh, oh
It's either now or never
I'll never be so fucked up again!
