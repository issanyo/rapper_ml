Teddy Pain, Teddy Penderazdoun
Let it be known when I roll around town
If your girl lost then she 'bout to be found
When I rock and roll, make that Boy Fall Out
Teddy bears on my feet all round
I'm back again, what you gon' do now?
Get out of this party girl and come back to my house
I'm about to show you how we do it down South
Take your shirt off

[Hook: T-Pain]
Ah ah-ah-ah ah ah, take your shirt off - HEY!
Ah ah-ah-ah ah ah, take your shirt off - HEY!
Ah ah-ah-ah ah ah, take your shirt off - HEY!
Twist it in the air like a muh'fuckin helicopter - HEY!
Ah ah-ah-ah ah ah, take your shirt off - HEY!
Ah ah-ah-ah ah ah, take your shirt off - HEY!
Brush 'em off, brush 'em off, do the dance man - HEY!
Twist it in the air like a muh'fuckin helicopter - HEY!

Take yo' motherfuckin shirt off - HEY!

Take yo' motherfuckin shirt off - HEY!
Take yo' motherfuckin shirt off - HEY!
Hey, twist it in the air like a helicopter

[T-Pain]
What it is, what it's gon' be
I see you in the crowd and you're looking at me
But you ain't doing nothing like you getting it for free
I don't wanna see no KNOT in that pretty white tee
Take it off for me, baby girl what you gon' do?
You looking like, "Who this motherfucker talking to?"
I wanna see that Baby Phat wrap around yo' head
Now answer this - is Auto-Tune really dead?
Take your shirt off!

[Hook]

[T-Pain]
Hey girl, what it is?
Should I take you back to my crib?
And take yo' motherfuckin shirt off (heh) shirt off
Take your motherfuckin shirt off, shirt off
Baby girl, what's goin on?
I know this is your favorite song
So take your motherfuckin shirt off (haha) shirt off
Take your motherfuckin shirt shirt shirt shirt shirt shirt
TAKE YOUR SHIRT OFF!

[Hook]
