[Verse 1]
She got a booty with a motor in it, look at how she wind it
Shaking, popping, got my soda fizzing, I want to get behind it
I ate that ass about a week ago, I made her do the Shmoney dance
She hit the stage with that bikini on, look like she got on money pants
Because she got a breadwinner, niggas tryna get in her
Thanksgiving, look at all that turkey dinner
Her ass go way back, America Online
I think I found a beeper in that motherfucker one time
She got that kind of booty that will change her life
Put your head on it, nigga going night night
Instagram from the gym, she got on them white tights
I done seen a lot of other booties, they ain’t quite right
She fine as hell, you can tell by her clientele
She a dime, if having that booty was a crime
I would make her pretty ass spend a night in jail
She got me snitching on that motherfucker
Somebody pay attention to that motherfucker
She make me bite my fist
I guarantee that you ain’t seen an ass quite like this

[Hook]
Oh my god Becky, look at that booty, that butt, that ass
Show me what you got, girl drop it like it’s hot
Oh my god Becky, look at that booty, that butt, that ass
Show me what you got, girl drop it like it’s hot

[Bridge]
You got to do it if you gone do it
Now how you gone act
You know I’m looking, you don’t really give a damn who is
Bring it back

[Verse 2]
She keep tellin me to come and get it, it ain’t hard for me to find it
She ain’t playing, but she playing with it, I wanna get behind it
Professional, rump shaker, earthquake maker
She go to shaking and niggas get on the table
Her ass go way back, it’s from the 80s
She make it sing to you like a California Raisin
I slap that ass every night nigga, but I do it how she love it
When I bust it, Imma bust it right nigga, that’s why she love me
She fine as hell, you can tell by her clientele
She a dime, at the very least she a nine
She hit the stage and unleash that behind
She got them hating on that motherfucker
But I be waiting on that motherfucker
She make me bite my fist
I guarantee that you ain’t seen an ass quite like this

[Hook]
Oh my god Becky, look at that booty, that butt, that ass
Show me what you got, girl drop it like it’s hot
Oh my god Becky, look at that booty, that butt, that ass
Show me what you got, girl drop it like it’s hot

[Bridge]
Oh my god, oh my god Becky
Oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god Becky
Oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god Becky
Oh my god
Oh my god, oh my god Becky
Oh my god

[Outro]
I been waiting too long
And it’s obvious, I ain’t fronting
But you been taking too long
You got all that ass for nothing
What are we gonna do to fix this
I know what you want, you know what I need, let’s get it
Ooh, baby I’m with it
Ooh let’s get it on, ooh let’s get it on
I just want to sex you up
So lay down and take it how you said you was
I know what you want, I know what you need
Sex you up
So lay down and take it how you said you was
Ooh, you know what I want
And I just want to be the one to sex you up
So lay down and take it how you said you was
