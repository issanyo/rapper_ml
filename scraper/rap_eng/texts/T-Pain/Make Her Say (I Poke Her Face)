[Hook: Kid Cudi & (Lady Gaga)]
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH)
Whaddup (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
Me first... hehe

[Verse 1: Kid Cudi]
Uh, uh-uh, she wanna have whatever she like
She can if she bring her friend
And we can have one hell of a night, through the day, aye
I mean you starin' like a creeper cause you gotta peep her
I mean you prolly might be sayin' you ain't jockin' either
But man, ol' girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, the type to make you tell a bitch just dance
And fuck them other niggas 'cause you down for her britches
Fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for the stickin'
And fuck them other niggas, hope she down for some lickin'
And fuck them other bitches 'cause she down for the trickin'
I'm hopin' she a rider
When it's said and done, do she spit it up or swallow now
I ain't gotta trip about them niggas who like her
Cause me and mami know who can really make her go

(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
Would you tell 'em 'bout her Ye?

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
She said, she want whatever she like
She said she gon' bring her friend
And we gon' have a hell of a night, through the day, I made her say
Hold up, (yeah?) born in '88 (Word?)
How old is that? (Man!) Old enough
I got seniority with the sororities
So, that explain why I love college
Getting brain in the library cause I love knowledge
When you use your medulla oblongata
And give me scoliosis until I comatoses
And do while I'm sleep, yeah a little osmosis
And that's my commandment you ain't gotta ask Moses
More champagne, more toasts-es
More damn planes, more coasts-es
And fuck a bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa, ohsa

[Hook w/ ad-libs & scratches from A-Trak]
(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say

[Verse 3: Common]
She said, she want whatever she like
But you gotta bring your friend
And we can have one hell of a night, through the day
She blamed it on the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-alcohol
She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
Her poker Facebook, I'd already read it
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South, looking for a pay day
Said, "bitch, you should do it for the love like Ray J"
But they say, you be on that conscious tip
Get your head right and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the godly to the party
It's the way I was raised on the Southside safari, so

(Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
I make her say (Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH)
When I (Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face)
(Can't read my, can't read my)
(No he can't read on my poker face)
(She's got me like nobody)
(Can't read my, can't read my)
(No he can't read on my poker face)
(She's got me like nobody)
