[Intro]
Yeahhh, yeahhhh
Yeahhh, yeahhhhhh, yeah

[T-Pain]
Growin up wasn't easy for me
For my momma for my daddy, life just wasn't happy at all
Started up when I was eight years old
And it blew up right behind me, God just couldn't find me no way
The way I feel (I feel) just can't compare (compare)
Don't wanna be here, God take me there
Cause now I'm livin on the road, goin to do show after show
My mind free and my eyes closed, I go back to Ridge Road

[Hook]
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
This 850 life is all I know, think I'll go back to Ridge Road
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
My big brother Sheed and Nathaniel, think I'll go back to Ridge Road

[T-Pain]
Slowin down wasn't even an option
So I chose to speed it up - yes I needed love always
You would hold me down when things got poppin
Had my back in situations, without hesitation fa sho'
The way you go (you go) is the way you know (you know)
So I guess I'll go, to the studio
And even if I'm on the road, goin to do show after show
My mind free and my eyes closed, I go back to Ridge Road

[Hook]
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
This 850 life is all I know, think I'll go back to Ridge Road
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
My brother Nadi Black and Dilla-Oh, think I'll go back to Ridge Road

[T-Pain]
Then I'm gone and you say you miss me
Like I never paid attention, never tried to listen to you
But now I'm home and you wanna diss me
Sayin I don't have no respect, a Leon County reject, no way
The way you go (you go) is the way you know (you know)
So I guess I'll go, to the studio
Cause even if I'm on the road, goin to do show after show
My mind free and my eyes closed, I go back to Ridge Road

[Hook]
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
This 850 life is all I know, guess I'll go back to Ridge Road
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
Can't forget about my homeboy Dough, guess I'll go back to Ridge Road

[repeat 2X]
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
'Bout to hit for life until I go, guess I'll go back to Ridge Road
R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
Tallahassee the eight-five-oh, guess I'll go back to Ridge Road

[Outro]

R-I-D, to the G, to the E, R-O-A-D
