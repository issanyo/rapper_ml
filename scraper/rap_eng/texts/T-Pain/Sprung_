[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
She used to work at King of Diamonds on a Monday
Only hit the club on Saturday and Sunday
I used to pull up every weekend, you shoulda seen her
The way she did it, nobody could do it cleaner
I seen her in the suit for my birthday
And I can tell you the reason these niggas thirsty
Lil mama getting it in all on her worst day
Lil mama getting it in, she put the school in the gym into her workday
I'm sprung, she got me doing the dishes
Held a nigga down when the clip was to an extension
You so bad, you so vicious
I'm so glad that you're not his chick
She want a new nigga, you got the right one
I'm all in the bed, she lookin' like fun
Pull up on me baby, just for the night
They sayin' I'm sprung, they right
Ayy, shawty got me
