[Verse 1]
You was all
Pussy poppin' all over the place like
Booty dropping all up in my face
You was ready
Just let 'em feel the music
You got sex appeal and you know how to use it, c'mon
Put me in a trance when you dance
Ass bout to come out of 'em pants
Big ol', thick ol' thighs
Keep on, keep on ridin'
I'm just here to see whats happenin'

[Bridge 1]
But keep doing your thang
Let me make it rain
Bartender, let me get one mo' round
Shit just got real, and its about to go down, c'mon

[Pre-Hook}
In the club you was Mrs.I'll-Do-Anything-But-Nothing's-Ever-New-To-Me
I should've known you was ready for me anyway
I can tell by how you look at me
I don't know what you thought i said
Or what you made up in your head, but

{Hook]
We both been drinking that Patron, right
Yeah, i know why you got two pairs of shoes and a change of clothes
What you came for
We both been drinking that Patron, right
Yeah, i know why you came for
We both been drinking Julio when we bout to get two mo'
What you came for

[verse 2]
You was all, like, who you with
I'm the ball, you the shit
Girl, I'm ready
Just let her feel the bass, yeah
Get that cup out your hand if you ain't gon' drank shit, c'mon
Dirty one, dirty one, stop, hmm drop
Get your friends, baby come back to my spot
Whatcha mean what I mean
I mean this ain't the scene
Baby you can clearly see whats happenin'

[Bridge 2]
Bitch i do my thing
You see me make it rain
Bartender, let me get one mo' round
Shit just got real, and it's about to go down, c'mon
