J-A-Y
Shaded Remix

*Yuh*
Showed up looking clean
See the bling like
Fuck it

Mold
So old
Gold on my nuggets

*Yeah*
Thanks to my swag
Call me dad
She flooded

Shades so high
Rolling by
We stunting

Mama got hoes
They be touching each other

Rhymes so sick
Shit'll make you spit up
*ugh*

Me and havoc
Be rappin
They trynna come wit us

They Walk the wrong way
Round us No fuss
Pussies Get lit up

I'm litter than glitter
I'm litter than he be
I'm litter than ender
I'm litter like T.P
Bitches be acting
Just Put em on T.V
Turn on her faucet
Jus leave the bitch leaking
Beats stuck on trunt
Can't hear when you Speaking
I'm all in ya dreams
You shouldn't be sleeping
Roll up the good nd we party all weekend
Mami a freak and
She bringing like 3 friends
