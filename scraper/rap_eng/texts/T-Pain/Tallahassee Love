[Intro: T-Pain]
Epiphany
E-P-I-P-H-A-N-Y
Definition 1: the manifestation of a supernatural being
Definition 2: a sudden moment of insight or revelation
Marinate on the though
Tallahassee love

They thought I left, man
Yeah, T=P-A-I-N, let's go man
T-Pain, man, I'm back in this thang
You already know what it is
Hey, Tallahassee got my back, though
This how it went, aye

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I used to hit the stage with my J's on
40 brought me to the West Coast
Now it's khaki suits with my shades on
I'm on the same shit, game on
But on Sundays I'm like Diddy - grown man with one chain on
When I come back, niggas see my growth
They see my momma's two cars and both of my daddy boats
They see the Sean John coats tag
They see my wife hoppin' out the Lamborghini with the Coach bag
I'm gettin' paid for nuttin'
Sittin' back, drinkin' lemonade, chillin' in the shade; I'm stuntin'
Makin' hits when I graze the button
Go ahead and put them two baby seats in my Escalade
It's nothin', I'm gettin' money
Learned from the past and the future
Learned not to never stab a nigga that'll shoot ya
Even though my pockets gettin' fatter
I'm still gettin' Tallahassee love, and that's all that matters
J-Lyriq get 'em

[Hook: J-Lyriq]
I've been there, and I've been back
But somethin' here, always brings me back
So when I'm here, I get that (Tallahassee love)
If you love me, then I love you
My people love it, when I come through
So when I do, I get that (Tallahassee love)

[Outro: T-Pain]
It shouldn't have to be like this man
I don't know how I did it either, ,man
I know you haters hatin' this right here, boy
Second time around, let's go, man!
