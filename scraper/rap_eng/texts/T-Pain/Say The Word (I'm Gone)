Why do we do this?
Why do we chase after dreams?
So stupid
So useless
Why am I foolish?
Why am I made out to be translucent?
Can't see through this
No way
I'm gone
Why does it hurt?
What do I deserve?
Just say the word and I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone
You don't have to be this way
You can hold what you say
And it don't have to be this hard
I'm lost, I'm gone
I'm lost, I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone
