[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I put you on the PCH, in a two-seater (On God)
Walking 'round a mansion in a white beater (No job)
Reaching that Chanel bag pull out the heater
I'ma make your life a hundred times sweeter
'Cause I'ma get you

[Chorus]
Straight, in line
Straight, big time
Straight, in line
Baby, I'ma get you
Straight, in line
Straight, big time
Straight, in line
Baby, I'ma get you

[Verse 1]
Straight up and down
Straight as a bar

Stunt on these bitches, flex on these whores
(Flex on these whores, woo!)
You just say less and I give you more (Got what you want)
Back the the truck up to the mall, comin' out with a star
What the fuck a bitch gon' do
When she see the diamonds on you?
Hate, hate, hate, hate
Fake, fake, fake, fake
What the fuck your man gon' do
When he see my hands on you?
'Cause boy lemme tell you sum'n

So you can't tell me nothin' (Nah)
You can't tell me shit (You can't tell me shit)

So I got your bitch (Boy give me that)
She money hungry (Open that mouth)
And I feed her dick (Oh yeah)
And she say she love me
And she keep me rich

[Pre-Chorus]
I put her you the PCH, in a two-seater (On God)
Walking 'round a mansion in a white beater (No job)
Reaching that Chanel bag pull out the heater
I'ma make your life a hundred times sweeter
'Cause I'ma get you

[Chorus]
Straight, in line
Straight, big time
Straight, in line
Baby, I'ma get you
Straight, in line
Straight, big time
Straight, in line

[Verse 2]
Straight out Prozano bitch lay it down

And I screaming how the fuck your bitch gon' feel
When I make her take all these pills?

Shake, shake, shake, shake
