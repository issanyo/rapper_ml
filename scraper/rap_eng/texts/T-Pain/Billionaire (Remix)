[Intro: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I would have a show like Oprah
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas
Give Travie a wish list
I’d probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain’t never had shit
Give away a few Mercedes like, "Here lady have this"
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish
It's been a couple months that I've been single so
You can call me Travie Claus minus the Ho-Ho
Get it, I’d probably visit where Katrina hit
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did
Yeah, can’t forget about me, stupid
Everywhere I go, I'mma have my own theme music

[Hook: Bruno Mars]
I wanna be a billionaire so fricking bad
Buy all of the things I never had
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine
Smiling next to Oprah and the Queen

Oh, every time I close my eyes
I see my name in shining lights
A different city every night
I swear, the world better prepare
For when I’m a billionaire

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Billionaire dollar crib, stadium, theatre
Personal ball cleaner, the closet's all Gators
I'm eating this morning, break-fast
I'mma need 1st place, I refuse to take last
You can hear the wordplay on the top of the bass-clap
You niggas is all drop-outs, you hate class
Until them umbrellas pop out, splish-splash
Ain't no rain on her blou-ouse, get back
Cause them doors close by themselves
Oh, no-no-no, I don't need nobody help
They say I'm backwards cause the doors on my Phantom open up the wrong way
And I'm like no, homeboy, you just making the wrong pay

[Hook]

[Bridge: Bruno Mars]
Oh-oh, oh-oh wanna know where I am there is nothing wrong, nothing wrong
Oh-oh, oh-oh even back to the ghetto ghetto ohhhh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh this car and those cribs, I need it all
Oh oooh oh oooh for when I’m a Billionaire

[Verse 3: Gucci Mane]
Gucci Mane la Flare in the building, yeah
Right back like I never even went nowhere
Growing up, I dreamed I would be a billionaire
And when the Jordans came, I could buy a billion pair
Cause zillionaires swagged up, swear it ain't fair
Lames lay game and they too too square
Life's too short to sit back and look
Every night is a movie, my life's a book
Money rules the world, but money runs to me
You can't put a price tag on what God's done for me
I wanna be a billionaire so freaking bad
So I can tell all my haters to kiss my ass
It's Gucci

[Hook]
