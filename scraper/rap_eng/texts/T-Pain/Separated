[Verse 1]
We would always have the ability to start off right, right
By the end of the night we end up in a fight, whoa
Girl you said you’d never leave me, but you might
This time, this time, this time...
We was doing so damn good for so damn long
But as you can see something went terribly wrong, whoa
I been through this so I can stay strong
This time, this time, this time

[Hook]
Separated, separated
Separated, separated
Cause yesterday was cool and the day before
But tomorrow there will never be no more of
Separated, separated

[Verse 2]
We would always have the ability to pull it back together, gether, gether, gether
And you was always down for me, you ain’t give a fungress to whatever, ever
But now you’re here telling me that you deserve better
This time, this time, this time
Hey, and now im sitting here in the dark with nobody
And I don’t wanna be alone I need my shawty, shawty yeah
Cause luxury means nothing without the luxury of love

[Hook]
