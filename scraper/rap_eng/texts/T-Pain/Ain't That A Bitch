These niggas tryin' to be black Bill Gates
But what they can't see is Bill Gates tryin' to be the white version of me
Ain't that a bitch (ain't that a bitch) ain't that a bitch
Man I just wanna get rich
So I can see my niggas live and watch them haters die slow
I used to be in your position so you know that I know
That's a bitch (ain't that a bitch) ain't that a bitch
Man I just wanna get rich
Ain't that a bitch
Man how'd you wanna get rich
And I can see my niggas live and watch them haters die slow
I used to be in your position so you know that I know
That's a bitch

[Verse 1]
Smoking on this technology
My presence is a present she ain't gotta acknowledge me
No matter how I gotta get it even robbery
It's black mask on you motherfuckers like it's Halloween
Follow me bitch I'm all that
You gotta be kidding that big dog with that small cat
I'm the dean I got a permanent hallpass
So when you see me in the hall you better haul ass
Fall back, all my watches is wrong
3 hours late to the Grammy's you can watch me at home
My 808's a gracious taste like a Glock to the dome
Ten thousand dollars suit you think I was marking Capone
These people hate the truth if you don't believe in that
Then why the paparazzi don't give a fuck where I'm eating at
Cause you know real niggers ride and white niggers hate
So then you realize

Man how'd you wanna get rich
Ain't that a bitch
Man how'd you wanna get rich

[Verse 2]
I got good news and bad news
The bad news is that the good news is sad news
But the good news is you finally gettin' what you wished for
But everybody wish they can get shit they don't do shit for
So what makes you so different is this what you deserve
I've been eatin' I've been eatin' I'm not ready for desert
I escrit in die escrit man I'm finna hit the curve
I believe it I've been reading I'll take any good word
Praise the Lord nigga you got me
All these can be yours nigga houses and bugatti's
You doin' bad ho you better
You tryin' to get this bread bro,blue cheddar
My mind frame is boss boss boss
That's on everything I get on
Make 'em fucking clone now on anything I sit on
You niggas look like quadlets I prepare to get my shit on
You keep messing me up you gon' get pissed on
