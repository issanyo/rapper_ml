Got that ? on my mind, steady driving and more
Ain?t no time for stopping, see that green light, let?s go
Got that money bag for that money bad, get it all for that low

That exchange and that hand shake, don?t count it all in a row
Do a hundred thous quarter mill, half a mill hey
Treat this money like my ? I?ma fuck her eryday
See her ass?

I?m blowing all this money, man I?m trying to find a new breeze
Trying you and me to come up, nigga?
Real niggas don?t stand out
Click clat, we clap it all, desert eagle, 5 o
If you ain?t over your city, why the fuck you all in my convo

Point being? or take mine
I pause nigga I pause, no draws that?s hang time
Calling my accountant tell that bitch I got?
See tomorrow on the news money tall like the ain?t?
My money, right, my money, bread good, good, good
Shawty fuck it, what?s so good?
That hair good
Bang, bang, pow, pow, I do my thang than
Look at me now, now

My money right, money money pass up
Up and away
Face down, ass up, I rip my town, that?s where I?m from
So nigga pow pow, boom boom
