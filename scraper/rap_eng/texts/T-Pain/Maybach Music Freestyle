[Hook: T-Pain]
Realest shit I ever wrote, chilling in my Maybach
Whatever I send out homie, I’mma make back, back
Can you believe it? You gotta see it
‘Cause I don’t plan on going broke, put that on my Maybach
‘Cause I’m in it to win now, niggas can’t take that
Listen to my Maybach Music, to my Maybach Music

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
I’m trying to ride up in a whip, it’s a fuck you to being violent
And I be down a quarter tank before my tire spin
My shorty carbon footprint look like a Louboutin
But I’m in New York, I’m only driving when I move my car
You know you in it when you buying at La Guta Park
Swimming in a pool of blue bloods ‘cause it confuse the sharks
You do the math, I’m creative, I’d rather do the art
And my crew is smart, I only rule as you pursue your heart
And my heart is on my sleeve, made it easier to stay
I did the harder thing to leave, the Roc is in my soul
I took a part of it with me, know a army of hoes
Trying to be all that they could be, right? Yeah
Video models ain’t getting paid, they getting laid
Thinking that they vixens because they stripped on they Twitter page
They saw the videos drop and they opinions changed
But I forget ‘em as soon as my first million’s made, yeah

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
And we expensive sippers now
She don’t sober up ‘cause she fucking to sweat the liquor out
The same Spic but now roll with a different crowd
Ripped the muffle off of my whip and now that shit is loud
On my fly shit from them Levi fits
To them Dunhill frames that I’mma cover up my eyes with
None of ‘em surprised that I’m rolling in with a nice number
And my shorty high as a kite but I’m the kite runner
I had a couple of people talking when they see me passing
In a way, you people acting, it’s like you really need reactions
If you unhappy, I’m grabbing all that you dream of having
You should spend less time sleeping and turn your dreams to actions
They after Benjamins in Washington Heights
Everybody trying to forget what earning Washingtons like
