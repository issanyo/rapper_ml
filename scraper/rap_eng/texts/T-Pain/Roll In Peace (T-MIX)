[Intro: T-Pain]
(Yeah, boop boop , yeah, boop)
If we gon' be Florida niggas, let's be Florida these days, know what I'm talkin' about?
(Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
We all roll together nigga

[Chorus 1: T-Pain]
You can't kill me, nigga, I swear that I've been died before (bitch)
God told me that I was gon' be here back in '94 (bitch)
Chevrolet got that motor (bitch)
Diamonds all on my molars (bitch)
Parkin' lot, I lift the door up (bitch)
Got your bitch snortin' Coca-Cola (bitch, bitch, bitch)
I can't even roll in peace (why?), all my cars orange and green
I can't even go to sleep (why?), your bitch keep blowin' me (yah)
I rep that shit from the eight-thousand-fifty down to the Florida Keys (yah)
Set my nigga Kodak free (why?), that ain't where he supposed to be (oh yeah)
Niggas must wanna bleed (ooh), they don't wanna play my beat (ooh)
Niggas ain't rats where I'm from (why?) so they don't fuck with my cheese (nah)
Every Florida nigga comin' up, that is that shit that I like to see (oh yeah)
Every Florida nigga sayin' that they the only Florida nigga
That shit don't sound right to me (nah), my niggas gon' blast for me (yeah)

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
If you talk that blasphemy (yeah), blastin' a fuck nigga head off (woah)
That shit is a blast for me (yeah), so why you ain't show me?
All the pussy niggas talkin' shit that don't know me
Before me and Kodak roll through slowly
[?] at four in the morning (ooh)
I'm about to switch my hoe up (why?)
'Cause everyone seem startin' to throw up
Gotta hit a lick, can't mess up (why?)
I know she 'boutta run my check up (ohh)
I'm her baby papi (ohh)
I'm her baby daddy (ohh)
She in love with a Florida nigga, she don't wanna leave Tallahassee

[Chorus 2: T-Pain]
You can't kill me, nigga, I swear that I've been died before (bitch)
God told me that I was gon' be here back in '94 (bitch)
Chevrolet got that motor (bitch)
Diamonds all on my molars (bitch)
Parkin' lot, I lift the door up (bitch)
Got your bitch snortin' Coca-Cola (bitch, bitch, bitch)
I can't even roll in peace (why?), all my cars orange and green
I can't even go to sleep (why?), your bitch keep blowin' me (yah)
I rep that shit from the 850 down to the Florida Keys (yah)
Set my nigga Kodak free (why?), that ain't where he supposed to be (oh yeah)
Niggas must wanna bleed (ooh), they don't wanna play my beat (ooh)
Niggas ain't rats where I'm from (why?) so they don't fuck with my cheese (nah)
Every Florida nigga comin' up, that is that shit that I like to see (oh yeah)
Every Florida nigga sayin' that they the only Florida nigga
That shit don't sound right to me (nah), my niggas gon' blast for me (yeah)

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah, thought you gon' ride for me (yeah)
You my little Tesla V (skrrt, skrrt)
Spent that hunnid on jeans
That's how much I believe
Uh, every day Halloween (alright)
But we don't trick and treat (straight up)
Count deads in my dreams (cash)
Can't even fall asleep (yah)
Pop on ya, send the opps on ya
Hollow clips in magazines
RoboCops on ya, rainin' shots on ya
Drop your top off with that bean
Mix it one-handed, please (it's lit)
Mix it right, dirty tea
It's only gonna bring me peace (straight up)
Don't leave my cup, that's for me

[Chorus 3: T-Pain]
You can't kill me, nigga, I swear that I've been died before (bitch)
God told me that I was gon' be here back in '94 (bitch)
Chevrolet got that motor (bitch)
Diamonds all on my molars (bitch)
Parkin' lot, I lift the door up (bitch)
Got your bitch snortin' Coca-Cola (bitch, bitch, bitch)
I can't even roll in peace (why?), all my cars orange and green
I can't even go to sleep (why?), your bitch keep blowin' me (yah)
I rep that shit from the 850 down to the Florida Keys (yah)
Set my nigga Kodak free (why?), that ain't where he supposed to be (oh yeah)
Niggas must wanna bleed (ooh), they don't wanna play my beat (ooh)
Niggas ain't rats where I'm from (why?) so they don't fuck with my cheese (nah)
Every Florida nigga comin' up, that is that shit that I like to see (oh yeah)
Every Florida nigga sayin' that they the only Florida nigga
That shit don't sound right to me (nah), my niggas gon' blast for me (yeah)
