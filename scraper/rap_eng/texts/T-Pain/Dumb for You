[Verse 1: Krizz Kaliko]
Okay, did I do it, did I put the key in the door
And lock that thang down
Did I hit it? Yes I did
Only problem is you got a boyfriend, and he way too hot now
She ain't say nothing bout marriage
So don’t get carried away and get buried
It can get real dumb, and ignorant, Killa City's where I'm from idiot
See here’s the deal, she got a baby by some young punk
Runner run up on me, it’s feeling too ill
Never check the player, check the game
You never came up home
I don’t know why she did you like that
I borrowed your girl and gave her right back
Give me a little bit of that side of the carpet that
I have a side bar, she don’t know how to act
You better get her
She got gold, winner like it was born in her
The big ol' booty keep me warm in the cold winter
It can go stupid, that means I’m gon' lose it
Where you find her from? Fire 'em and
Fire another one

[Hook: T-Pain]
Man, I’m about to go stupid
But I’m always representing where I’m from
From, from, from, from, from, from
And if a nigga wanna try me
Better tell him roll right by me when he come
Come, come, come, come
I’m about to go
Dumb for you, oh, dumb for you, yeah
Dumb for you, oh, dumb for you
I’m about to go
Dumb for you, oh, dumb for you, yeah
Dumb for you, oh, aah
I’m about to go

[Bridge]
You're one hundred we so hunterish
And you'll be muggin' 'er when she's bumpin this

[Verse 2: Krizz Kaliko]
Mister goodie good could change it to make it hood
I love to keep the piece, but I wish a nigga would
Leggo it would be different if she sell out
Do you know what you headed for
If I cock it then let it go?
You gon' seek she lonely and chose me
You bored at home alone and tryin' to blame it on me
Keep my family riding with me, but sometimes I’m solo
You don’t know I can really make it go doe-doe
(Kali Baby)
And I ain’t have to force her to come
Divorce her, before it gets dumb

[Hook: T-Pain]
Man, I’m about to go stupid
But I’m always representing where I’m from
From, from, from, from, from, from
And if a nigga wanna try me
Better tell him roll right by me when he come
Come, come, come, come
I’m about to go
Dumb for you, oh, dumb for you, yeah
Dumb for you, oh, dumb for you
I’m about to go
Dumb for you, oh, dumb for you, yeah
Dumb for you, oh, aah
I’m about to go

[Outro: Krizz Kaliko]
Aha, T-Pa-a-ain
Okay, Kali baby
