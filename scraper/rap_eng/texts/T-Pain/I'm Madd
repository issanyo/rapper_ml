[** feat. Tay Dizm:]

[Verse 1: ~T-Pain~]
I'm not in the mood boy let me tell u sumin
Ok nah nah nah nah
I'm fresh out of a steppah, I'm ready, fiyad up
It's probably the worst time for me to go out to da club
But I don't give a F**k, see a pussy nigga make em give it up
Punch him in his stomach make him throw all of his liqua up
I'm pissed enough to do it, I'm fynna do it on a nigga
I'm thinkin to myself how close can you get to a nigga
But I'm already beside him, take a step behind him
I blind sight his ass, sit back and laugh Motha f**ka I'm Mad

[Chorus:]
I'm about to kick sombody' ass
I dun had a bad day I need somethin to make me laugh
Cause I'm mad, If you missed the club nigga you best to be glad
That would have been you ass, Motha F**ka I'm mad
DJ play me somethin I get Hype too
I ain't not no beef with chu homie but I would like to
Bitch nigga tonight you go down fo da town
Now I'm glad I had the day dat I had cause Motha f**ka I'm Mad

[Verse 2: ~Tay Dizm~]
Ya'll dun f**k around da game and put me on some gutta shiiitt
And I'm standin tall, sayin f**k yo whole Click
Now watchu gone do you know I am the f**kin True
My eyes blood shot ready to go to war
I am with real niggas neva f**k with fake niggas
Straight from the hood call me the real go getta
Bitch yee ain't neva had what I had
Take bout 50 steps back cause Motha f**ka I'm Mad

[Chorus:]
I'm about to kick sombody' ass
I dun had a bad day I need somethin to make me laugh
Cause I'm mad, If you missed the club nigga you best to be glad
That would have been you ass, Cause Motha F**ka I'm mad
DJ play me somethin I get Hype too
I ain't not no beef with chu homie but I would like to
Bitch nigga tonight you go down fo da town
Now I'm glad I had the day dat I had Motha f**ka I'm Mad

[Verse 3: ~T-Pain~]
Now some niggas might say day don't believe me
How tha f**k dis Sangin ass nigga gown beat me
Bitch please, we can start off in the moon if you don't get it up
We can take it to the parkin lot and throw the fisted cups
Now bitch get up, I don't gotta act hard I'm already talk bitch
Just don't touch my family or anybody I f**k with
My goons ell send yo ass to bagh Dad, in a glad bag get the money and send em half back Motha F**ka I'm Mad

[Chorus:]
I'm about to kick sombody' ass
I dun had a bad day I need somethin to make me laugh
Cause I'm mad, If you missed the club nigga you best to be glad
That would have been you ass, Cause Motha F**ka I'm mad
DJ play me somethin I get Hype too
I ain't not no beef with chu homie but I would like to
Bitch nigga tonight you go down fo da town
Now I'm glad I had the day dat I had cause Motha f**ka I'm Mad
