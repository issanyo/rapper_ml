[Intro: Post Malone]
Ayy, ayyy
Hahahahaha
Tank God
Ayy, ayy

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (-sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas (-tas)
When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Post Malone]
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" (Scott, ayy)
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison (-son, ayy)
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car (car, ayy)
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" (ayy, ayy)
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend (yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (-sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas (-tas)
When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Oh shit, hey
I just did like twenty shots and now I'm standin' on top of a cop car
Hey, she been givin' me head for twenty minutes, man, this bitch gotta have lockjaw
Ain't no retirin', bitch I'm firin' out the car, let the Glock off
Hey, and it's a job, take the car to the karate shop and chop that bitch like water
Man, my shit been going back-to-back, grrra-ta-ta-ta, just like a choppa
Police pull up behind me, ain't no time to go and hide it, throw the rock far
Valuable, for twenty minutes, oh man, my shit is 'bout as swole as a gold bond
I got plenty more, prolly fifty more, but this is what we did so far-ar-ar

[Chorus: Post Malone, T-Pain & Joey Bada$$]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
(Ah-ahah-ahah)
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy, ayy, woo!)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (-sta, yeah, hey)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas (-tas, badman)
When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta (yeah, ta, pow, pow, pow)

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
This that Amethyst Rockstar-life, might not make it
Drop gems 'til I shine bright, just be patient
Two girls in my hotel bathroom naked
That's the type of thrill that I like, don't waste it
My cup filled with no chaser, I'm wasted
Mixin' weed with the Henny, got me cross-faded
Like, "Sorry, no interviews, y'all caught in the Matrix"
Checkin' for statements, life is what you make it
I'm never on vacation 'cause there's no days off
All the hard work, dedication, know it all pays off
I been gettin' no sleep, I been workin' graveyard shifts
I'm a Braveheart, shit, they call me the Sergeant
The general, my squadron, the Pro Era army
Droppin' bombs, this is just the calm before the storm, see
They can never harm me, my brother catch a homi
T-Pain, Post Malone, Joey Bad, this is godly
Huh, hahaha

[Chorus: Post Malone]
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (-sta)
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas (-tas)
When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta (ta, pow, pow, pow)
