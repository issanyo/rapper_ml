My boy Kardinal, leader of the session
Black Jays pop it if we need an intervention
Murder all these little song boys in succession
Niggas ain't eatin..it's a convict recession
Gettin paid to shut down the show is my profession
Fuck keepin it easy i am not about aggression
Approach if you want but use your discretion
When i crush these rappas careers they get left in a depression

You better stand clear when the mike's in my possession
And i bust every year cuz that is my obsession
It's a T-Dot T-PAIN, Kardinal expression
Black Jays fire like a black Smith and Wesson
You're done mon!

Bustas don't bother me nooo
Unless i bust a top for the 8-5-0 (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Me say go! me say stop! pop! rahh! rahh! rahh!
Pop a top for the 8-5-0

Pass it to the ear with a mere pom pom!
Policeman they fear we don't keer pom pom!
Pop it off and bust it open here pom pom!
Let them hear pom pom! let them hear pom pom! let them hear pom pom!
Rahh!
You see me coming man better get runnin man cuz when you see me you gon see me with my gun in hand
Dont be a (?) man we makin money man
For we keep it comin comin
Tell them fools they need to just shut up
Roll near and farmer boys get fucked-up
Keep on talking and we kick your door not on
Find you in pieces your whole body cut up
Your king shut up scared why get this oh no
Dog don't argue to live this is so no
45 caliber will have your skin bono make your skin bono make your skin bono

Bustas don't bother me nooo
Unless i bust a top for the 8-5-0 (oh oh oh oh oh oh)
Me say go! me say stop! pop! rahh! rahh! rahh!
Pop a top for the 8-5-0
