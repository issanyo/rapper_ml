[Intro: T-Pain]
Wayne, I'ma hold you down on this rap shit, mane

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Ha, once again it's on
My respect level now is unheard of
Niggas was laughin', now they wish they never heard of 'em
Now they gon' learn to respect me, bruh
I lick a shot, 9 millis get burned in their retina
Have that lead come out the back of your head
One word is what I said, click clack and you're dead
Put one more of them claps in the back of your leg
I hit ya arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Damn, if you was just a virgin to Pain
Just think of me as the R&B version of Wayne
But since he doin' the same thing now it's no difference
Ice grill, hood niggas put your dentures in
He so sweet make her wanna lick the singer
So me and Weezy gang bang her
Pullin' on my roots, I had to hang her, whip her
Tallahassee dick her, I'm back on the map

[Chorus: T-Pain & Lil Wayne]
'Cause he rap, he sang, and he do, his thang
And he does, we does everything you wish you was
It's T-Wayne, it's T-Pain
Bang, bang, yeah
He rap, he sang he do, his thang
He does, we does everything you wish you was
It's T-Wayne, alright, bang, bang
Weezy, oh, oh

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
It's the white cup dranker
Baby I'm a trapper turned rapper turned sanger
Darlin', suwoo to the bangers
And if you want beef, I'll cook that angus (uhh)
Thank God I'm famous
'Cause a lot of these ballers'd be around here chainless
But I made bling bling, yeah, ching, ching
And these sorry-ass rappers make a nigga wanna sing
I'm in love with a stripper
And I send shots like the bartender
And I'm like bitch, ain't me, get in line with the rest
'Cause even the best say Weezy the best
Okay shawty, you ain't messin' with  a Li'zane nor Wizane
Just a Lil Wayne and a whole lot of Pain
You know what I'm sayin'? Like
I'm mind rockin' models with a bottle, if you can't swallow
Shut up, bitch, gargle, that's the motto, holla

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
He rap, he do, he does
Everything you wish you was, it's T-Pain, baby
He rap, he do, he does
Everything you wish you was, it's T-Pain, babe
