[Verse: T-Pain]
You did me wrong but I'm stronger now
It won't be long before I'm on top of you again
And this time you can't hurt me cause I know you'd just desert me
You're just that kind of person and I won't let you convert me
I belong (I belong) to a better girl
She ain't home so come rock my world
Cause I miss the way we did it and I know you do too
So pay that old flame a visit let's do what we do because

[Hook : Shay Mooney]
Talk stay still when you hit me
I don't think you realize girl are you listening
I just gotta get back in my zone get along take it slow
I just can't let you, can't let you go
Still feel your lips when I'm kissing
On another girl got me wi-wi-wi-wi-wishing
We were slow dancing to our song all alone take it slow
Can't let you, can't let you go
Do you remember this (x3)
I just can't let you go

[Verse : Shay Mooney]
Baby the way you lookin' got me falling off the stars
I ain't no player but for you I play the part
Serenading for your lady got me singing
Tonight you're gonna love me like you did before
Am I crazy for calling out your name
I'll never be the same
Girl why you told me that way
Can't you see you're killing me

[Hook : Shay Mooney (x2)]
