Verse One [Yukmouth]
Yeah shorty drop that ass like a 6-4
And if she want some more money she could get more
The Louis bag full of cash, what they hittin' for
I'm about to throw it in the sky watch it hit the floor
Now get low, get low, get your dough girl
You must got the green light 'cause you go girl
I make it rain and watch you swing around the pole girl
Then I'm a treat that ass like the po po girl (that's classy)
Unload girl (go)
Girl, shake what your momma gave ya
The boss player make 'em drop it like a hot potato
Yeah, I make 'em drop it like a hot potato
I'm poppin' rubberbands man 'cause I got the paper
Poppin' bottles like I shot the game, win the layup
Sexual eruption, Ma the ho's want to lay ya (the power)
Calico bussin', let the po po spray ya
'Cause little mamma got the bomb like Al Qaida

Verse Two [Yukmouth]
(Yeah, yeah)
Shorty put it on me, she got that whipper pill
I gave her 50 bills, now that's the TIP drill
Like DJ Drama, 5000 one's
Soon as the money gone another 5000 comes
And I don't count the one's, I just throw the stacks
Like a quarterback, then mommy throw it back
Bust it wide open, mommy throw it back
I'm about to cock the .44 and unload the gat
Woah, woah, slow down baby
We in the VIP it could go down baby
And what it's sittin' for, I throw the dough down baby
Then I'm treat that ass like a full pound baby
Lock... load... bust... spray (bddah)
Me up in your mouth is like eatin' a payday (hah)
We'll keep it on the low like free at AJ (shhh)
We could make a sex tape like Kim and Ray-J (ay, ay)
