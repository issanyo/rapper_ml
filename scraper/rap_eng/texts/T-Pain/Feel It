Sip on some of this platinum?

All you gotta do is ask for some

Please don't try to move me, shawty

Mami over there off the chain
Ass gorgeous, lips insane
Hip like boom and a ass like bang
One time for them boys on the block
All pushing that ying and that yang, you know
That D, that rock, that 'cane
Aww, yeah mane!
Now she movin' like she can't stop
She can be from Thailand that way that she bang cock
I'm tellin', you mami do anything
And she throwing it back like a b-b-boomerang
I went a little bit below her belly ring
Like a belly ring, badabing, hm, badaboom
Now dim the lights down in the room
While I slide in you like, ohh can you feel it Dale!
