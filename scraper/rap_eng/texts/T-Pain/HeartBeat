[Verse 1]
This is the moment
The kind we only get to see in the movies
Explosion
I can’t explain what you do to me, hey
I ain’t frozen in time
This has got to be what love is
Tell me you’re mine

[Hook]
I can’t remember what enough is
You got me tweaking, got my heart jumping up there
Make me go deeper, got them lights up and that TV down
Turn up them speakers, don’t speak
I just want to hear your heartbeat
I don’t want to go nowhere, I don’t want you to leave
I just want to hear your heartbeat
I don’t want to do nothing, let’s just sit here and breathe
I just want to hear your heartbeat
And when the daylight shines on us, and we ain’t had enough
There’s no sound, just you and me, and heartbeat
And heartbeat

[Verse 2]
I can’t control it
It’s like your running electricity through me
I’m focused, yeah, I want to show you the real me, yeah
What’s going on in your mind?
I wish you knew how good your touch feels
Tell me you’re mine

[Hook]
I can’t remember what enough is
You got me tweaking, got my heart jumping up there
Make me go deeper, got them lights up and that TV down
Turn up them speakers, don’t speak
I just want to hear your heartbeat
I don’t want to go nowhere, I don’t want you to leave
I just want to hear your heartbeat
I don’t want to do nothing, let’s just sit here and breathe
I just want to hear your heartbeat
And when the daylight shines on us, and we ain’t had enough
There’s no sound, just you and me, and heartbeat
And heartbeat
