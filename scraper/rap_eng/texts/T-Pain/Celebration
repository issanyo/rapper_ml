Every play tint shades, make these niggas know my name

Shining hard every second don't blink ho
If you ain’t sipping and you tripping better drink more
Too many dicks on the field trying to get yours

Won’t hurt her so girl let go
They say they ain’t tricking if you got it
But we ain’t tricking anything and we got it, so

Getting money, rocking clubs like T. Woods
Bright lights like we living in the sky
