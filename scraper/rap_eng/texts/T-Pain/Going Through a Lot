[Intro]
Konvict Music
It's time to do it

[T-Pain]
I can't handle all these bills and payments, this stuff is overstressin me
But I still gotta do it
Baby mama put me on them papers, ain't get nothin for the baby
But I still gotta do it
I can't keep on workin (keep on workin) seems like the whole world's ignorin me
Bbut I still gotta do it
Schemers keep on jerkin (keep on jerkin) everybody's gettin more than me
But I still gotta do it

[Chorus: T-Pain]
So pass that drank (pass that drank) pass that 'dro (pass that 'dro)
It's my life (it's my life)
So what'cha thank (what'cha thank) what'cha know? (What'cha know?)
It's alright, and I paid the price, but still I'm goin through a lot
Sittin on the block now (through a lot)
Slangin out my drop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin me, whether they see it or not - goin through a lot
I'm hatin on the cops now (through a lot)
Wishin they would stop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin me, whether they see it or not - goin through a lot

[T-Pain]
All this music got me goin crazy, can't even concentrate on my family
But I still gotta do it
Plus I gotta go through all this family hatred
I don't know why everybody's hatin me
But I still gotta do it
Even one of my homeboys thankin that I'm bangin his lady
I don't know why he would think that out of me
But he gotta go through it
To all the nappy heads I got you baby, we 'bout to make it yes indeed
And we gon' get through it

[Chorus]

[Bone Crusher]
I work a 9-to-5 shawty and they think it's funny
And how they feel that my stress don't count homey
I hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block
Because my baby's gotta eat, I ain't gon' never stop
I see them laughin at me fo' cause my pants raggedy
And my do' won't shut and my car's shaggy
But I see the future man like I'm Nostradamus
And in my heart all I see is a future star
But in my brain ain't nothin but these notes man
But y'all don't feel my stress y'all don't UNDERSTAND~!!
The next step is the pistol and it goes down
Mellow it out fat boy, just calm down
And sing this song.. and sing that song
Cause God gon' make a way for me to get my hustle on

[T-Pain: repeat 2X]
Goin through a lot; sittin on the block now (through a lot)
Slangin out my drop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin me, whether they see it or not - goin through a lot
I'm hatin on the cops now (through a lot)
Wishin they would stop now (through a lot)
Nobody's helpin me, whether they see it or not - goin through a lot

[Outro]
Goin through a lot, through a lot, through a lot
Goin through a lot, through a lot, through a lot
