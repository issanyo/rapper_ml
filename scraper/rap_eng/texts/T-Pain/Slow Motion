[Intro: T-Pain]
Boom!
You know, you know who this is man
Young Cash, T-pain, we Slow Motion baby
Ha! This it!
You see me like...

[Chorus: Young Cash]
I'm gone (I'm gone) and I'm high (I'm high)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
We're movin' left to right (to right), side to side (side to side)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
I'm gone (I'm gone) and I'm high (I'm high)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
We're movin' left to right (to right), side to side (side to side)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)

[Verse 1: Young Cash]
Shawty, I'm gone
So you know when I get home I'm gon' make that bedrock
Double shot ceramic got me twisted like a dread-lock
Listen to that gangster music, it's gonna make your head bop
Come in here with my dogs, and if you true us we'll let that leg pop
(Fight! Fight, fight, fight)
I'm drunk but I got my people with me
Same niggas that's still creepin' with me
That .45, I keep it with me
Everything is movin' slow, it's like promethazine
Codeine, feel like I'm in Texas, nigga sing-a-lee

[Hook: Young Cash]
This ain't that purple Sprite, this just that purple weed
I'm on that Kryptonite, I'm movin' half speed
I'm movin' left to right, and it ain't hard to see
That I am feelin' right, so nigga, pass the weed

[Chorus: Young Cash]
I'm gone (I'm gone) and I'm high (I'm high)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
We're movin' left to right (to right), side to side (side to side)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
I'm gone (I'm gone) and I'm high (I'm high)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
We're movin' left to right (to right), side to side (side to side)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Pistol!
I've been, bangin', swangin'
All over the curve movin' in slow mo'
From the dip and the paint too sweet, no homo
I let 'em see me at the red light and you see the lead pipes spittin' out flames when I rev up
If my nigga got cash and a problem with Cash then a motherfucker better put his bread up
And then I go slow motion when I'm in the drop head, I let 'em see the heads drop
I go coast to coast man, now I got [?], connects, and Xbox
And I'm sittin' on a pint so you know I stay rollin' on them dubs
I be slap up, slurp up, slap up, slow motion in the club

[Chorus: Young Cash]
I'm gone (I'm gone) and I'm high (I'm high)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
We're movin' left to right (to right), side to side (side to side)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
I'm gone (I'm gone) and I'm high (I'm high)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
We're movin' left to right (to right), side to side (side to side)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)

[Hook: Young Cash]
This ain't that purple Sprite, this just that purple weed
I'm on that Kryptonite, I'm movin' half speed
I'm movin' left to right, and it ain't hard to see
That I am feelin' right, so nigga, pass the weed

[Chorus: Young Cash]
I'm gone (I'm gone) and I'm high (I'm high)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
We're movin' left to right (to right), side to side (side to side)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
I'm gone (I'm gone) and I'm high (I'm high)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
We're movin' left to right (to right), side to side (side to side)
Movin' slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
Slow motion in the club (slow motion on 'em)
