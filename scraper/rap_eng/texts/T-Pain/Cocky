That old me, I'm a O.G. in the Old Game
But enough on me let's talk about who own Pain
Oh man, we goin be here for a whole day
Talking bout who started this artist shit it's way harder than it look
This autotune hook, I offered the book
And ya daughter goin be ship when she find out you getting on mo' Pain
Fuck what them hoes say, this what'cha dog saying

I'm Mr. Biggs ya bitch, I let my dog lay ya
All I do is spit and you stop, I'm like a dog sprayer
