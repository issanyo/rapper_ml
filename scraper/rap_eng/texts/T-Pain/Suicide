[Verse 1]
The world keeps spinnin', with or without me
And I know, that's hard to believe
And now I'm in a box, with nothin' around me
Cause I found, a girl that'll get on her knees at ease
And all the while, I'm knowin' that my homies will clown me
Cause I fucked her - and didn't have a rubber on me
It seems I had to find out the hard way
That the girl, that I found, in the crowd, she had H-I-V
And now she next to me like

[Hook]
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)
La-la-la, la-la, la, la la, la-la-la

[Verse 2]
One, two, three, four, five, six million ways
To leave, this whole wide world, so cold
Stuck on my ass, I been drinkin' for days
And I got the nerve to put that Bonneville on the road
Got that thang on me, and a couple kilos
A bag of ecstasy, and a pound of that dro
But I guess, I had to find out the hard way
Cause I done came, to the End of the Road
And now I'm in the mirror like

[Hook]
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la (Suicide)
La-la-la, la-la, la, la la, la-la-la

[Outro]
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la
La-la-la, la-la, la, la lah, la-la-la...
