[Intro/Interlude]
Could it be it's just that simple now? (x2)

[Verse 1]
Yeah, we want that monotone, monotone
And that's why we all paid this hard-earned money to get packed up in this Thunderdome
I'm like "What is wrong? For Pneumonia?" cause, man, I spent my whole check
To hear you talk about yo' life and how you got my check round yo' neck
We want that monotone, monotone, yeah, yo' album live and all
To be honest, I ain't think that you were performing live at all
And God forbid you do it right or how it ought to be sung, nah, nah, nah
(I'mma need you to do that shit at the top of yo' lungs)
But I guess, if yo' shit was gonna be monotone, I coulda just
Saved my check and listen to yo' songs at home cause let's be honest
I could throw my iPod on and the place'll go stupid
And I'm lookin' at you, kid, like "I wouldn't let you on for nothing with that bullshit you just did"

[Bridge]
But you just laugh, throw money, watch the bitches scatter
Cause it worked before so why not follow the initial pattern?
So, while you on vacation, I'll be at home, alone
In my mirror with a brush and a comb
Singing that ol' independent song like
Man, man, man, I wish I was you
Or at least on yo' level, man, I'd diss the shit outta you
I don't know if you work tonight, shit, that ain't my business
But I swear I'm gon' make it, I got God as my witness

[Hook] (x2)
I'm gon' see you on my way up and see you on yo' way down
Cause right now, I'm just another nigga in a hype crowd
And you don't even know that I been plannin' yo' demise
So I'll advise you keep yo' eyes on the prize cause I'm on the rise

[Interlude/Intro]

[Verse 2]
Yeah, we want that monotone, monotone
Oh, you better than the peons? And at the end of the night
You gon' find a bitch with a switch you can pee on
Oh, you one of them niggas, huh? You laugh cause it's funny
And I'm one of them niggas like (They should've never gave you niggas money)
But I done it, made it to the front row and you don't wanna look at a nigga
I'm making eye contact like a nigga got on five contacts, I want my $99.95 back
You hide in the back cause you tired, out of breath and shit
You better be glad I paid money, I woulda been left this shit
Motherfucker, you got fans and we got out motherfucking hands up for everything that you sayin'
And we wanna be appreciated, I borrowed 20 bucks, I'mma eat the aided
So you can at least say "Hey, shit", I'm tryna be like you for my three lil' babies
Jerome and Tanik' and Casey but you looking at me like I need to face it

[Bridge]
Fuck my situation cause you just laugh
Throw money, watch the bitches scatter
Cause it worked before so why not follow the initial pattern?
So, while you on vacation, I'll be at home, alone
In my mirror with a brush and a comb
Singing that ol' independent song for what?
Man, man, man, I wish I was you
Or at least on yo' level, man, I'd diss the shit outta you
I don't know if you work tonight, shit, that ain't my business
But I swear I'm gon' make it, I got God as my witness

[Hook]
