[Verse 1]
See I shit on my jet
Never shit on my set
Put shit in my tech
Play pussy get wet
My shit all good nigga my shit and my hood
My shit bounce back like I know my shit would
Paper chase make money see the sunshine
Big time nigga put the money on grind
On rewind nigga set a new hieghts
Get money all night
Nigga takin' private flights

[Chorus T-Pain 2X]
You know I'm gettin' money
Shinin' like a sparkle
Sparkle like I shine
Bitch I'm on my grind
If you don't believe it look at these zero's
Cheddar cheese,the bread mucho deniro
I'm gettin' money

[Verse 2]
Got on the pinky red diamond
Red bandanas
Uptown soldier
That's how we plan it
Swervin' in the bentley
All (?)
Tool on my side
That H in the caddy
Duffel bag full of paper homie
Big money nigga that's how we play it homie
While some niggas ball watch'em fall
Watch them niggas don't fall ball and bounce right back nigga

[Chorus T-Pain 2X]
You know I'm gettin' money
Shinin' like a sparkle
Sparkle like I shine
Bitch I'm on my grind
If you don't believe it look at these zero's
Cheddar cheese,the bread mucho deniro
I'm gettin' money

[Verse 3]
With a leader
Sprite 2 liter
Watch with the meter
Nigga couldn't see her
Nigga wanna eat her
Nigga you can eat her
Money you can feed her
Diamonds with a chauffeur (yeah)
New hundreds
Milk colored new benz
New condo spent about 5 M's
New diamond teeth spent 1 M
New (?) and versace with the new lens

[Chorus T-Pain 2X]
You know I'm gettin' money
Shinin' like a sparkle (sparkle)
Sparkle like I shine (shine)
Bitch I'm on my grind
If you don't believe it look at these zero's
Cheddar cheese,the bread mucho deniro
I'm gettin' money

Shinin' like a sparkle (sparkle)
Sparkle like I shine (shine)
Bitch I'm on my grind
If you don't believe it look at these zero's
Shinin'
Shinin'
Shinin' like a sparkle (sparkle)
Sparkle like I shine (shine)
Bitch I'm on my grind
If you don't believe it look at these zero's

You know I'm gettin' money
Shinin' like a sparkle (sparkle)
Sparkle like I shine (shine)
Bitch I'm on my grind
If you don't believe it look at these zero's
Cheddar cheese,the bread mucho deniro
I'm gettin' money
