[Intro: Austin Mahone]
Somebody's gotta do it
Do it, dirty work
Somebody's gotta do it
Somebody's gotta do it, dirty work

[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
Rolling my sleeves up to here
To make you smile ear to ear
Girl, I've been hitting that, hitting that graveyard shift
You won't find another one built for this
Dirty work, ooh, dirty work
Baby, I don't need no help
I'd do it all by myself
Girl, I've been putting in, putting in over time
You ain't gotta tell me what's on your mind
Dirty work, ooh, dirty work

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Cause when you do what you love
You're gonna love what you do
You know I do it with love
Each night I do it for you

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
It's the dirty work
Do it, dirty work
Somebody's gotta do it
Somebody's gotta do it, dirty work
Somebody's gotta do it
Do it, dirty work
Somebody's gotta do it
Somebody's gotta do it, dirty work
You know it ain't no nine to five, we're going sundown to sunrise
Dirty work

[Bridge: Austin Mahone]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, dirty work
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, hey
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, dirty work
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, do it
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You know it ain't no nine to five, we're going sundown to sunrise
Dirty work

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Ain't no need to clean me up
Baby, you just stay dirty enough
You need to get down in the dirt
Ooh, keep it moving, now I gotta work
'Cause now I got you doing that dirty work, oh

[Pre-Chorus: T-Pain]
Cause when you do what you love
That means you're doing it with me
And when we do what we do
You just can't do it for free

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Somebody's gotta do it
Do it, dirty work
Somebody's gotta do it
Somebody's gotta do it, dirty work
Somebody's gotta do it
Do it, dirty work
Somebody's gotta do it
Somebody's gotta do it, dirty work
You know it ain't no nine to five, we're going sundown to sunrise
Dirty work

[Bridge: Austin Mahone]
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, dirty work
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, hey
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, dirty work
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, do it
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
You know it ain't no nine to five, we're going sundown to sunrise
Dirty work
