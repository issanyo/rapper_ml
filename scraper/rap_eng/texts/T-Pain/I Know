[** feat. Young Ca$h:]
How many days I'm gon' wait
How long I'm gon' wait before you say we gon' date
When you gon' take debate
'cause if you don't take it I bet another girl will
Drop that lame nigga
Come and get with somethin' real, I'll
Pressure points get touched when I walk by
And I ain't interested in what that nigga talkin bout
So let's not talk bout him
Wassup with us
And wassup with you getting on that Nappy Boy bus, trust
Me won't a damn thing go wrong
I'm too right and tonight we listenin' to slow songs
Them other hoes gone
I did away with 'em
Call that nigga
Tell him you don't think you gon' stay with 'em
Just tell him what it is
Tell him you found a new nigga with a bunch of [? ]
And a black card
And I side girl
Now give me the phone [ring ring] (hello)
Yea, boy that's my girl

[Chorus:]
I know that you want me
And you know I want you too
So baby stop trippin
And let's get missin'
You say you with your homegirl
Baby you can bring her too
It don't make a difference
You f***in with a pimpin
(Ay, that's what it is baby)
