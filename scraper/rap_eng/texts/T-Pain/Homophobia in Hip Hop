On the time he compared himself to reality star Ray J:

I think it's just niggas man. You ever notice how homophobic niggas is all the time? It's like, dude if you ain't gay, then gay things shouldn't bother you, gay people shouldn't bother you. You ain't going to get your ass pumped dude, ain't nobody trying to look for you my nigga. You can say gay things but not be seen as gay. You don't gotta say, 'No homo.' You ain't gotta say, 'I want a hot dog, no homo...' Be comfortable with your manhood. We know you fuck bitches my nigga

On his assistant, who is gay:

I can see people not fucking with me because he's there. It's like, bro, you ain't even got bitches, why do you think this gay dude going to like you? Bitches don't even like you

On Frank Ocean:

I think the radio is getting more gay-friendly. I don't think urban music is getting more gay-friendly because if that was the case, Frank Ocean would be on a lot more songs. I know niggas that will not do a song with Frank Ocean just because he gay, but they need him on the fucking song and that's so terrible to me man... What I do ain't going to affect nothing that you got going on
