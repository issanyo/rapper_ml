Symphony crack!
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
Let me get this right let me get this clear…
Settle one more game, we gonna prove we’re as best this year!
Start right here, start right…
Right here in front of our folks, in front of our fans
Some of them…

…play no game, watch me do my thing
Bring it down like Wu-Tang …want my name?
..all the way, turn up, turn next
..off in this bitch
I’mma cute dog take what I see!
All shit, get a seat, light a Cush, can hear that shit!
Smoke… nigga, so… smell that shit!
Everybody lay it down, come on…
Everybody in the …come on…it’s your thing!

Chorus:
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!

…drop this beat, drop this beat!
From that gunshot straight ...
Country music got me rapping, I know why
You’ve been this shit since I was a child!
Hola, hola, what you got to say?
That the haters brought me back and.. a major way!

Best believe it for you…
Guess my people cut the crap an they’re saying:

Chorus:
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
Now get your…
Or maybe if you’re ... some of us right here
Then none of these would matter
And...wouldn’t have to make a song with all these
Flutes, clarinets, trumpets and trombones
My drum shit is led by Louis Vuitton
Louis shoes, Louis drum sticks, and Gucci…
Who you think you’re fooling, you’re not fooling me son!
… favors, we ain’t doing you one!
Here some advice! ... an we’ll talk negotiations
If you’re hasting, we’re not pacing, we’re take it…
Understand, this corporation is more like a congregation
And come up with compilations that will have you make…

Chorus:
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
