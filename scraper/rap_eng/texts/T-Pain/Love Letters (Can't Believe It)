Dear Baby
It's only been a day of not
Speaking to you- and I've got
So much to say...
Come over, and sit down for a while
I just wanna hear you laugh-
I just wanna make you smile
We don't do these things to each other
Cause we're not fighters...
We are lovers

I know you've got a lot
On your mental
And dealing with these things-
Isn't so simple...
But it's worse when you keep
It on your self
You started shutting me out
And I was only tryna help...

But I can't make choices for you
It's all up to what you're gonna do
But just don't stay gone- please
Come back soon...
My emotions are a storm
A full on typhoon...

I've said it before, that you
Know this isn't us...
You told me once you've only
Got three people who you trust
Your mom, your dad, and then there's me
So I know it's not so easy-
For you to just leave

We were just two kids-
Claiming to be royalty
But I do think you're my king
And you'll forever have my loyalty
So you can put down your pen
And turn on me your back
But I'm staying right here...
Because the good needs her bad

You think solitary is what's best
But nix that option- what's next?
You're getting frail- lean on me, Baby
You may claim you're not my man
But I'm forever your lady
Because I'm keeping my crown...
I'm staying your queen
You may tell me to go...
But I'm not gonna leave

When empires start to crumble...
And you can't walk only stumble...
I'm going to be your crutch-
Because I've been there before-
I know the weight is too much

Babe, come lay your head on my shoulder-
Days are growing longer, and
The nights are getting colder
Both getting more wise, as every
Day makes us older
Just close your eyes, and try
Not to care
I'll sing to you, and play
With your hair
Because when you're stressin'
I'll be only one- whose truly there

Now I lay you- down to sleep
Lean over you- kiss on the cheek
All of you is mine, from your
Head to your feet
I'll lay down beside you
Isn't this so sweet?
I wish I could say 'yes'
But you're haunting my dreams...
So, I just stay awake-
I really don't know how much
More of this I can take

But I guess that's alright...
I'll take you in dreams if
It means- I can see you at night
I just want another story to tell
Another love song for us to cover
So well
But, that'll happen again in due time
So I'll get it ready- writing out the lines

I've been trying- to keep you
Off my mind...
But, you just mean so much to
Me that I just fail at even trying...
Do my words- have any meanin'?
You liked my last post on Insta
I can't believe it...
Do you know the song's for you?
Everything I said, you know it's true
Like I said- you're completely irreplaceable
And ever since I got you back-
I'm not letting go...

But that's all for this letter
I just want things to get better...
You've planned out our future
So you want us forever...
There's a lot to tell you
But it all can't be written...

Here's to Sincerely, Bryson-
From Yours Truly, Kitten...
