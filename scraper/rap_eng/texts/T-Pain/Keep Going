[T-Pain]
Yeah, uhh
Mmm-mmm
Hmmmmm, keep goinnnn
Yeahhhh
Mmmmm
They hit me up in the mo'nin
They give me reason to believe I'm here
For somebody, someone
They make me feel so joyous
Happiness ain't no word to describe
What I, feel

Like when I try to give it up
Sick and tired of all the stuff
They give me reason to keep goin
And goin
When I feel like I should quit
I keep goin

I never knew this would happen
And if you knew 'bout my past
You would seeeee
Whyyyyy it's a miracle
Heh, but you can see why I'm happy
Nobody wishes for me
This was prayer, where
Would I be without them? Heh

And when I try to give it up
Sick and tired of all the stuff
When I feel like givin up
I keep goin
They give me reason to keep goin
And goin
And goin
