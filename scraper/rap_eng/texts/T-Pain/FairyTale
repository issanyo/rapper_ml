[Verse 1]
See once upon a time there was a girl
That fell in love with a boy
And he watched the news while she was cleaning his shoes every day
See I wish we lived in a perfect world
Cause for this boy and this girl
Their relationship sucked, they never ever made love
They barely talked to each other
But you would think they were the perfect couple
Not knowing that they both been living double
They go out to eat and every time that they meet they'd get along
Sit down and then they talk and even smile
Cause nobody knows all the while
At the end of the night they gonna get in a fight when they get home

[Hook]
And that's why I, wish that I could live in a fairytale
Cause everyday would be so good
But when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could (oh), if I could
And I would kill myself if I could
Cause when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could

[Verse 2]
See once upon a time there was a man
Who was in love with a lady
They went on morning walks and they would talk and talk
'Bout how they are happily married
One day that man went on a ride
And had a girl in his passnger side
Then the lady saw him and she tried to call him
But she ain't get no answer
She leaving voicemails, texting
Cause all she can think about is him and the girl sexing
The best thing to do is follow him to the spot
And she gon' kick the door in if he like it or not
So the lady (lady), went crazy (crazy)
She said, "How can you do this to me baby?"
She told him to go 'head and stay with the girl he with
But he better pack his shit when he get home

[Hook]
And that's why I, wish that I could live in a fairytale
Cause everyday would be so good
But when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could (oh), if I could
And I would kill myself if I could
Cause when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could
