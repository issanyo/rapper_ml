Boom, come on, baby, keep on doing what you doing
Boom, come on, baby, keep on doing what you doing
Boom, come on, baby, keep on doing what you doing
Hey, come on, baby (Pizzle)

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Look at her go, yeah, I see know what she doing (look at her go)
Look at her go, yeah, I see know what she doing (look at her go)
Wobble-dy wobble-dy drop, drop it like it's hot
Yellow Nuvo got me wobbling back to the parking lot
Look at her go go go, do it, girl
Go go go, do it, girl
Go go go, do it, girl
She wo-wobbling, wobbling, drop, drop it like it's hot

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Gon' shake that booty (booty), let me see that Gucci print (print)
Super stupid (stupid), you know what you doing then (then)
Loosey, loosey (loosey), get a bottle of Goose in hand (hand)
Teddy Pizzle, all I do is win
Bang bang, baby, I know that you want some (some)
Walk up in the club, already on one (one)
Get rid of your friends (friends), they ain't no fun
I'mm show you how to do this son
She walked, wobbling wobbling, drop, drop it like it's hot
That yellow Nuvo got me wobbling back to the parking lot
She steady popping, she popping, she said that she don't wanna stop
I got that chopper, that chopper, just 'case your nigga wanna block
She keep grinding on me, she gon' feel something on her butt
A-a-and if she donâ€™t know what's happening after this, I tell you what

Bitch, you know you wanna get up on this butt, now what you saying?

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Look at her go, yeah, I see know what she doing (look at her go)
Look at her go, yeah, I see know what she doing (look at her go)
Wobble-dy wobble-dy drop, drop it like it's hot

And baby, I've been looking for you for a while now
And I ain't playing with you, baby, pull them draws down
Ooh, she a freak and she know it (know it)

Girl, wobble-dy wobble-dy drop, drop it like it's hot
Wobbly wobbly to the ground
I know you hear that bang bang, that's the bass in my Chevrolet
Gang bang, that's with me but we here to celebrate (woo)
Super red and me and Teddy in the Chevy with these hoes (Nappy Boy)
Ha, just look at her go

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Look at her go, yeah, I see know what she doing (look at her go)
