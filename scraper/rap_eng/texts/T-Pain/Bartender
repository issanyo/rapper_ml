[Intro: T-Pain]
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Broke up with my girl last night so I went to the club
So I went to the club
Put on a fresh white suit and the mini coupe sittin' on dubs
Sittin' on dubs
I'm just lookin for somebody to talk to and show me some love
Show me some love
If you know what I mean, uh-huh
E'rybody jockin' me as soon as I stepped in the spot
I stepped in the spot
Two hundred bitches and I'm bettin' ain't none of them hot
Ain't none of them hot
Except for this pretty young thang that was workin' on the way, at the top
On the way, at the top
Shawty what is your name?

[Pre-Hook 1: T-Pain]
Ooh she made us drinks to drink; we'd drunk 'em, got drunk
And then I think she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We hit it off somethin' proper like

[Hook: T-Pain]
I like the bartender (ooh, if you're lookin' for me)
I'm at the bar with her (oh oh oh uh-huh, okay)
I like the bartender (yeah, if you're lookin' for me)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Got a brand new girl so I'm feelin all good inside
All good inside
Feel like I put some brand new 24's on a brand new ride
On a brand new ride
Triple shot of Patron on the rocks wit' a lil' bit of lime
Wit' a lil' bit of lime
I'm just keepin it real, uh-huh
Baby still workin' at the club so I'm gettin' in free
So I'm getting' in free
Wednesday night, I'm on the list, T-Pain plus three
T-Pain plus three
E'ry time I hit the spot babygirl takin' care of me
Takin' care of me
How do you think I feel?

[Pre-Hook 2: T-Pain]
Ooh she made us drinks to drink; we'd drunk 'em, got drunk
And now I know she thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back, and then I think that
We gon' have fun at my spot tonight

[Verse 3: Akon]
Shorty I'm sure you heard that I rarely ever come out
Ever come out
Unless I'm in the M6, doin' tricks, freeway burnt out
Freeway burnt out
Got a passenger side that's empty wantin it to be yo spot
Be yo spot
Put you on my Billboard, we can act like the charts, I can end up on top
And I end up on top
Don't smoke, don't drink, that's why I don't be by the bar baby
Just lookin at you from a distance, lookin like a God damn star baby
So my girl don't see me T-Pain, can I get those keys to the car?
Those keys to the car
'Bout to go and bang bang boogie with my cutie and I'll see you tomorr'

[Pre-Hook 2: T-Pain & Akon]
Ooh she made us drinks to drink; we'd drunk 'em, got drunk
And now I know, she thinks I'm cool
She thinks I'm cool
She gave me a wink, I winked back uh-huh
And then I think that uh-huh
We gon' have fun at my spot tonight
And we slide
