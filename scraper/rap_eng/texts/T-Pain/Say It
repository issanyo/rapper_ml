[T-Pain - the end of each line with .. echoes]
Ooooh pull up to my crib in your black Range Rover..
I got some plans that don't involve my hands..
Get out and walk up slowly, lemme see your new Manolo..
I don't think you ready for what's about to happen behind closed do's..
And girlll I want you to enjoy yourself, have you feelin so good inside..
So jump up on this roller coaster let me take you for a lappy ride

[Chorus]
And I'ma make ya say it (whoa whoa) say it (whoa whoa)
Say it (whoa whoa) what are you waitin for?
Say it (whoa whoa) say it (whoa whoa)
Say it (whoa whoa) what do you got in store?
Say it (whoa whoa) say it (whoa whoa)
Say it (whoa whoa) cut off the lights and close the door

[Interlude]
Whoa whoa (whoa whoa) and I'ma have you feelin so
Hiiiiiiiiiiiii-iiiiiiiii-iiii-aaaaaiiiiiiiigh

[T-Pain - same .. echo as before]
Girl your skin tone's so lovely got me breakin out in cold sweat..
You been here for 15 minutes, I don't know which way to go yet..
Girl you're so soft, I wanna break you off with some of this good love oOoOoH!
And you can tell me what to do, I won't stop until you say so..
And girlll I want you to enjoy yourself, have you feelin so good inside
So jump up on this roller coaster let me take you for a lappy ride

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Say it (whoa whoa) say it - and I'ma have you feelin so
Hiiiiiiiiiiiii-iiiiiiiii-iiii-aaaaaiiiiiiiigh
