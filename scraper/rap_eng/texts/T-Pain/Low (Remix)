[Intro: Pitbull, T-Pain & (Flo Rida)]
No I had to remix this thang right here
Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Flo Rida congrats boy, you got yourself one, ha ha! (Let me talk to 'em, let me talk to 'em)
Turn them groundhogs, always showing love
Hmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
We clash, what it is, what it ain't (Let me talk to 'em, let me talk to 'em)
Come on, Let's Go!

[Hook: T-Pain & Pitbull]
Shawty had them Apple Bottom Jeans (jeans)
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the floor (she hit the floor)
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low low low low low
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reebok's with the straps (the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (a smack)
She hit the floor
Next thing you know
Shawty got low low low low low low low low (Ha-ha-ha wooooooooooo!)

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
Stop drop roll, open the doors and baby light my fire
Watch how I carry this thing like Mariah
Trying to make loo like an LA riot
Stick it for the ice in the cream like Breyers
All messed up like Micheal Myers
I'm tryna multiply wha, you all dividing
Call it Ice Cube, get it hit it on a Friday
(Ya'll get knocked the fuck out)
When Pit go all out
I play broke, while your broke ass ball out
Me I'm Diddy, Jay Z and Stee stay a little bit a bigge gimme the loo and I beat out
What's your thing boy, forget a debate boy
They're filling me like Obama and Hilary
So pick up pick up your artillery before
You get cut up like umbilical cord, let's go

[Hook: T-Pain]
Shawty had them Apple Bottom jeans
Boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (ayy!!)
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

[Verse 2: Flo Rida]
I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go
This crazy all night spendin' my dough
Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go
Them birthday cakes they stole the show
So sexual, she was flexable
Professional, drinkin' X and oh
Hold up, wait a minute, do I see what I think I, whoa
Did I think I see shawty get low?
Ain't the same when it's up that close
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow
Work the pole, I got the bank roll
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes
I'm into that, I love women exposed
She threw it back at me, I gave her mo'
Cash ain't no problem, I know where it goes
She had them—

[Hook: T-Pain]
Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)
The whole club was lookin' at her
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low
Them baggy sweat pants
And the Reeboks with the straps (with the straps)
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (ayy!!)
She hit the flo' (she hit the flo'!), next thang you know
Shawty got low-low-low-low-low-low-low-low

[Verse 3: Flo Rida]
Hey, shawty, what I gotta do to get you home?
My jeans full of guap and they ready for shones
Cadillacs, Maybachs for the sexy grown
Patron on the rocks that'll make you moan
One stack c'mon, two stacks c'mon
Three stacks c'mon, now that's three grand
What, you think I'm playin', baby girl?
I'm the man, I'll bend the rubber bands
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder
I knew it was over, that Henny and Cola
Got me like a solider, she ready for Rover
I couldn't control her
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover
Shawty was hot like a toaster
Sorry but I had to fold her
Like a pornography poster, she showed her—

[Hook: T-Pain]
Apple Bottom jeans, boots with the fur (with the fur)
