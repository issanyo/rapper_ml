[Verse 1]
I have seen too many things
That'll make you want to sing, sing, sing
But that ain't what's been on my mind (I'm coming home tonight)

Oh baby, I've been up and down this road
Or so you have been told
But you won't be alone tonight (I'm coming home tonight)

[Pre-Hook]
I promise baby, would I lie to you?
I'm just being, honest baby
I want to fall in love tonight

[Hook]
I'm gonna row, row, row this boat
All across the seven seas just to see your face
And you won't be alone no more
'Cause girl I'm coming home, home, home (I'm coming home tonight)
I know you know ain't nobody in this world that can take your place
And I won't leave you alone no more
'Cause girl I'm coming home, home, home (I'm coming home tonight)

[Verse 2]
I've been waiting for too long
And this feeling has got too strong
Baby, I've waited all my life (I'm coming home tonight)
I can tell you what I've seen
But that don't mean a thing to me
You got me on your own tonight (I'm coming home tonight)

[Pre-Hook]
I promise baby, would I lie to you?
I'm just being, honest baby
I want to fall in love tonight

[Hook x2]
I'm gonna row, row, row this boat
All across the seven seas just to see your face
And you won't be alone no more
'Cause girl I'm coming home, home, home (I'm coming home tonight)
I know you know ain't nobody in this world that can take your place
And I won't leave you alone no more
'Cause girl I'm coming home, home, home (I'm coming home tonight)
