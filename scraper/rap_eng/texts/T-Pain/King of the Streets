[Chorus: T-Pain]
They done trying to defeat me, stayed on my feet
When they see me, they salute me I'm the king of the streets yeah
I got them walking like (left, right)
We the best, so we marching like
They follow me

[Verse 1: Ace Hood]
Okay, it's blood sweat and tears, it'd be the realest shit I ever wrote
Never stop or giving up, the realest shit I ever quote
Look into my eyes and you can see I hustle 24
24, 24 hours grinding overdose
Money running low, the studio rebirth an animal
People want that gutter back, that's just who I do it for
Giving them that manure flow
Having them know I'm trained to go
Heard them niggas dropping meat so fuck them, here's a dick to blow
Now I'm on the top of shit
Now they're showing sportsmanship
What it do and what it be, niggas on some other shit
Bitch, I'm on my own lane, only God judge me
All you rappers rapping is equivalent to rare meat
And now you're on my lying shit, starving like a full feast
Pussy niggas count me out, man I love to in-convene
Teddy P and Mr. Hood, you can call it history
We the best and fuck 'em all, we winning like we're Charlie Sheen

[Chorus: T-Pain]
They done trying to defeat me, stayed on my feet
When they see me, they salute me I'm the king of the streets yeah
I got them walking like (left, right)
We the best, so we marching like
They follow me

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
Well it's the highly underrated, album so anticipated
Mr. not intimidated by you suckers perpetratin'
I've been waitin', yeah boy, I've been waitin'
Heavy, humble and patient, but still embedded with greatness
I'm a motherfucking problem, y'all still in pajamas
Sleeping on the hotness while I'm out here chasing commas
Put that on my mama, I'mma give them hell while they're locked up in a cell
We the best is gon' prevail
Don't believe in see and fail
I'm conceited, you can tell
Look the devil in the eye, say, "I'm hotter than your Hell"
And I'm rocking with my chest out, head high, hello to the bad guy
Bitch it's my time, see the diamonds in the watch now
Don't want any handouts, fuck you niggas talking 'bout?
See me, you salute me like a motherfucking drill scout
Stunting on you niggas watch the Beamer when it pull out
Come and see me when you travel south

[Chorus: T-Pain]
They done trying to defeat me, stayed on my feet
When they see me, they salute me I'm the king of the streets yeah
I got them walking like (left, right)
We the best, so we marching like
They follow me
