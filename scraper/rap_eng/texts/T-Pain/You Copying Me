[Hook: x2]
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?

[Verse 1]
Here's a little story that I got to tell about a young motha'fucka that done went through hell
He started off in Tallahassee, Florida
Hoping that somebody would save him from the boredom
He started making beats for the locals, stacking bread
And joined up with the clique called the Nappy Headz
The money came slow, but the hate came quick
Talking behind his back, like "Pain ain't shit!"
He was going out of town just to put it on stage
Blind to the fact that he wouldn't get paid
Slept in the car, clothes in the back seat
Twenty dollars to get them hoes in the back seat
Got tired of that, then he set some goals
Hoping this rap shit'll get him some gold
Oh, never thinking of what he 'bout to be
Then six years later, everybody copy me, ya see me?

[Hook: x2]
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?

[Verse 2]
One faithful day, he said fuck it
Hopped in the Chevrolet bucket
Then he went to Mickey D's, got an application
Nowhere was just where this rap will take him
So he gave up, took the paper home
Four dollars an hour, that's paper hoe
But he ain't too grown, so he got no bills
No condos just enough to make it home
Then all ring-ring on the mobile phone
Area code said "404"
"Oh yo this Akon what up nigga? Man, yo shit sound good"
Shut up nigga! Click
Just leave me the fuck alone
And somebody better quit playin' on my fuckin' phone
And then he said "Naw, this is what I'm 'bout to do
Have everybody copyin' you, ya see me like"

[Hook: x2]
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?

[Verse 3]
Took tens in the bucket man fuck it I'm taking my black ass to the ATL
And I'm a make it there in three and a half hours even if I gotta go through hell
Now I can't tell that this is the kind of tours that I should be making all by myself
But Imma commit suicide if I see another untalented nigga on the Best Buy shelf
Well, hooked up with Akon and Boubacar
Sat down at a pizza parlor
It's kinda hard trynna explain who you are
When you showed up getting off the market
And so I showed them niggas a couple DVD's CD's
Showing the shit I did on TV
Cause I sucked at basketball
But this is way better after all, see me like

[Hook: x2]
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
