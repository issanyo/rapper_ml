[Intro]

I'm baaaaaaack!

Turn it up
Turn it up
Freaknik's back, baby
Turn it up

[Freaknik]
What's happenin', mothafcker?
You know who I is
It's Freaknizzle
Come to turn the party up to ten
I know you heard of me
Freaks get word of me
And they get wetter than blueberry vodka
Most Certainly!

Sup, mothafucker, you don't like me?
I heard you're throwing a party and did not invite me (did not invite ME?)
Plus I heard this shit wasn't exciting
Just a buncha bitches pullin' hair, fighting (fighting)

I see so much potential
Even though this area is a residential
Turn up the radio
Put on the instrumental
Party 101
Pick up a mothafuckin' pencil
I'm back bitch
Like that bitch
You ain't gotta have no bread, nigga
Just act rich
This ain't no fuckin' party over here
Now let me throw this mothafuckin' money in the air

[Hook]
Turn it up!
Freaknik is back in town so
Turn it up!
Bitches and hoes go get down so
Turn it up!
Bitch-ass nigga take off that do-rag
Turn it up!
24's and 4-12's in my new lac

[VERSE 2]
What's popin' pepperoni
Get your party hats
Strippers and hoes, bitches' and hoes
What's hard as that? (hard as that?)
I'm a dog on this shit yes all of that (all of that)
Family bag of BBQ chips nigga halla back
I've got bitches poppin' outta my chest (chest)
And most of them got there titties poppin' outta there dress (dress)
All kinda african diamonds poppin' outta my neck (neck)
Plane landing in the street hope outta that jet
Don't matta if your watch got a lot of a gets
You come up to one of my parties and get a lot of that sex (sex)
We here to have a good time you don't gotta wear a vest (vest)
But if those crackas' come they make a lot of arrests (lot of arrests)
We ain't' got a lot of me dog (me dog)
The weed good and the liquor free dog (this-is free dog?)
Meatloaf shrimp and rice pealof
Don't come up in this corner
There a bitch jackin' me off
Ain't' we all!? (we all!?)

[Hook]
