Part 1: Finish Line

[Intro: Eryn Allen Kane & Chance The Rapper]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
And we back, and we back, and we back, and we back
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
And we back, and we back, and we back

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
They ain't teaching taxes in school
It don't even matter, I was acting a fool
But who would think the raps would turn into racks?
Don't matter, matter fact, it could happen to you
Scars on my head, I'm the boy who lived
The boy love playing when the boy too sick
Reclining on a prayer, I'm declining to help
I've been lying to my body can't rely on myself oh no
Last year got addicted to Xans
Started forgetting my name and started missing my chance
L.A. for four months, end up leaving right back
I'm in love with my city, bitch, I sleep in my hat
I felt hogtied ever since my dog died
He lived to 84, damn, that's a long ride
I know he up there he just sit and he wait
I'll be racing up the stairs I'mma get to the gate singing

[Bridge: Eryn Allen Kane]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

[Hook: T-Pain]
Oh! All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine, yeah-eah

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
Hey! Gimme the water, gimme the water
I need the kind from Space Jam
Get this money, get this budget, KOK to day camp
Me and my girl plan to stay to the end
Hope there never come a day where we be better as friends
We in a marathon we could build a marriage on
Arguments as parents digging deeper than a baritone
I've been getting blocked just trying to make songs with friends
Labels told me to my face that they own my friends
I got to pray I got to pray, like Hammer after “2 Legit”
I got the power I could poke Lucifer with crucifix
I cannot scrap the stupid shit, I stand up like I'm Ludacris
I know some folks that talk so much
You'd think they drive an Uber whip
Damn, queen said, "Why we in a queen bed?"
I said, "It's yours, don't worry little bean head"
I'm just here to catch my breath, I got a world tattoo
She said, "Cool, just bring me some food"

[Hook: T-Pain]
Oh! All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Oh I'm gonna finish mine, yeah
All my days
I prayed and prayed
And now I see the finish line
Gonna finish mine, yeah-eah

[Bridge: Eryn Allen Kane]
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do

Part 2: Drown

[Intro: Eryn Allen Kane]
The water may be deeper than it's ever been

[Verse 1: Noname]
Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away, to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She likes her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love

[Chorus: Choir]
Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown

[Verse 2: Choir & Kirk Franklin]
Never, never, never! (Chance, let me in, come onin)
This thirst in my soul (There's a thirst in my soul, it tell me)
Where else can I go? (where?) but You? (come on)
I may cry a river (I may cry a thousand tears)
But You take each drop and You wash (You wash me new)
Me new (people sing)
This water is deep (yes, yes and I need You to)
Jesus rescue me (come on, save me, I need You to)
Take me to Your mountain (hallelujah)
So someday Chicago will be free (someday we'll all be free)
Be free (say!)

[Chorus: Choir]
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
