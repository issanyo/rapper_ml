[Intro: T-Pain & Lil' Mama]
Greatness plus greatness, equals great greatness
Hey, hey, hey, hey
The way we get loose, we move our shoulders
Forward, heads back
Get it in Control like Janet Jack
Get it on the flo', let 'em know what's happenin'

[Verse 1: Lil' Mama]
L-I-L, you better ask somebody
I been on my grind since butt touch potty
Y'all don't really want it with the young hot toddler
With a flo' so spec like techno-lotta
It's, so sick, how the clock go tick
Keep givin' y'all hits like techmatic
Uh, it's the reason why I spit it how I spit it
When I spit, it's like mucous, gotta get rid of it
These chicks don't pop like me
Uncompatable girl, no comparin' me
And ain't none of y'all scarin' me
Like don't ya wish ya girl was as bad as me? Yeah
With a flow so sick like Twista's
So sweet, but could be cold like a Mistic
Instincts come so smooth like what is it?
BK, H-dub ours like a wizard

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Lil' Mama & (T-Pain)]
Hey, shawty get loose, baby, do what you do
Lemme see you let down your hair
Shawty get loose, hit the dance floor and act
Like there's nobody else in here
Shawty get loose, krump, clown
Break it on down, baby, do your thang
Shawty get loose, PHAT, phat
Baby, I ain't even know you can break it down like that
That, that, that, that, that, that, that
Walk, walk, set, set, row, row, then you (uh-huh)
Walk, walk, set, set, row, row, then you (yeah, baby)
Shawty got loose
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that
Walk, walk, set, set, row, row, then you (you never know)
Get, set, set, go (Nappy Boi)
Shawty get loose

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
What it do? Teddy to the Piz-ayne
You already know, tell 'em I'm the miz-ayne
Shawty, you ain't messin' with a lizz-ame
I'ma have you loose on the flo', you gon' be steppin' with a cizz-ane
I mind-boggle models with a bottle of somethin' good
I'll take 'em to the hood and have they ass goin' insane
A hard rap artist that hang with singers
So don't thank that this thang is hard 'cause,  homie, it ain't
I'm loose, loose, you gotta be kiddin' me
You tellin' me, shawty, right here
Can take her hair down and do it like you, you
If all of this is true, you gotta show me what you do, show me, now do it
5, 4, 3, 2, 2, you know Pain came to change the game
All the way from the same thang to some of that new, new
Impress me, I want one person on this flo' to try and test me
Now shawty get loose

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Lil' Mama]
Hey, shawty get loose, baby, do what you do
Lemme see you let down your hair
Shawty get loose, hit the dance floor and act
Like there's nobody else in here
Shawty get loose, krump, clown
Break it on down, baby, do your thang
Shawty get loose, PHAT, phat
Baby, I ain't even know you can break it down like that
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that
In the crib, in the club, in the block, it don't matter, it don't, it don't matter
Shawty got loose
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that
In the crib, in the club, in the block, it don't matter, it don't, it don't matter
Shawty get loose

[Verse 3: Lil' Mama]
In the crib, in the club, in the block, it don't matter
I spit stats, 4, 5, 6, I do da-data
How she do, di-di-di-that like that?
Got the hood on the back and her pockets is fat
Still rollin', rollin', left, right
Shot callin', callin', that's, right
'Cause my team on the market, famila we 'bout to pop it
Lock, drop and roll like a hip-hop rock show
You never know where my mind gon' go
Not Puerto Rican but I like mangos
So smooth on the dance flo'
When you see me comin', I'm runnin' it like a game show
You ain't know, Lil' Mama go
She be runnin' and poppin' it, hit you wit the bust flow
She's hot
So get loose on the flo' and I cannot stop

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Hey, shawty get loose, baby, do what you do

Shawty get loose, hit the dance floor and act
Like there's nobody else in here
Shawty get loose, krump, clown
Break it on down, baby, do your thang
Shawty get loose, PHAT, phat
Baby, I ain't even know you can break it down like that
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that
Shawty got loose
That, that, that, that, that, that, that, that
