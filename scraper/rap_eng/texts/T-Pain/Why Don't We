[Verse 1]
It's 4 o' clock in the morning and I can't keep my eyes open
Give me a kiss. shit. I love to feel your lips
I'm a get you done like you never been done
Baby girl stay focused
I'm a put my hand on your stomach, watch me caress and stroke it for you
Gonna feel good, you got me unstuck
Ooh, girl, why don't we just fuck

[Chorus +ad libs]
It's in the middle of the night and I
Just wanna give it to you right and I
Can't even hold it back, you gotta tell me why
Baby, why don't we just fuck
Shawty we already had sex
But you ain't never felt the best of me yet
Now what we gon; do is a little more than making love
Baby, why don't we just fuck

[Verse 2]
I ain't trying to be rude, I just wanna be a dude and wanna get it poppin'
Cause once I start, shit, I ain't never gonna stop it
If it's all about the motion in the ocean, then girl I'm a have your boat rocking
When you put on your lotion, I'm hoping that you turn around and drop it for me
Damn, you look good, I think I'm in love
Ooh, girl, why don't we just fuck

[Chorus +ad libs]
It's in the middle of the night and I
Just wanna give it to you right and I
Can't even hold it back, you gotta tell me why
Baby, why don't we just fuck
Shawty we already had sex
But you ain't never felt the best of me yet
Now what we gon; do is a little more than making love
Baby, why don't we just fuck
