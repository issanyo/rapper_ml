[Intro]
Yeah
Take over, take over, take over
Yeah, yeah, ay

(Pizzle!)

[Chorus]
The take over real as fuck, the take over real as fuck
The take over real as fuck, the take over real as fuck
I started this shit, I started this shit
I started this shit, I started this shit
I started this shit, And this the thanks I
This the thanks I .... This the thanks I get

[Verse 1]
This the part where them broke niggas put they headdown
Ay, shawty in my section cause there's money on the ground
Shawty a pill popper, she got the Xans on her (she got 'em on her)
I swear to God, I'm gon' pull out the rod and she gon' put hands on it (Show me your hands)
She know what the move is, she know what to do with the two zips
She know what the groove is, she a pro she know what to do here
I'm in the locker room with the house mom trying to work out a new deal
She got some new girls, so I need some new deals
HUH
Baby tell me how you feel
Cause I took the red pill, and you took the blue pill
You smart - I got it on me, I got it on me
Never leave the house without it, I'm by myself but I'm never lonely
Oh my god, I got the cheese cheese macaroni
Cause I been working on my grind
But right now I'm fucking some pussy and ass, and so is my niggas

[Chorus]
My niggas real as fuck, my niggas real as fuck
My niggas real as fuck, my niggas real as fuck
The take over real as fuck, the take over real as fuck
The take over real as fuck, the take over real as fuck
I started this shit, I started this shit
I started this shit, I started this shit
I started this shit, And this the thanks I
This the thanks I .... This the thanks I get

[Verse 2]
I been keeping my mouth closed and I don't know how long it's gonna stay like that
Keep on talking that fuck shit and Ima spray that mac grrat-gat-gat-gat
I got bitches in the bushes across the street from your house right now
I got yo bitch in the house with a dick in her mouth right now
And it ain't even mine, it ain't even time for that
My nigga just saw her walking down the street and she said she was down for that
Now I know my pimp game strong, now correct me if I'm wrong
But my nigga handled that shit so well that he need a crown for that
You know, HUH
Now she sucking on me
Trying to do it good but she keep on getting hit in the nose with my heat
Now bitch gon' star
I got it on me I got it on me
Never leave the house without it, I'm by myself but I'm never lonely
Oh my god, I got the cheese cheese macaroni
Cause I been working on my grind, but right now I'm fucking some pussy and ass
And so is my niggas

[Chorus]
My niggas real as fuck, my niggas real as fuck
My niggas real as fuck, my niggas real as fuck
The take over real as fuck, the take over real as fuck
The take over real as fuck, the take over real as fuck
I started this shit, I started this shit
I started this shit, I started this shit
I started this shit, And this the thanks I
This the thanks I .... This the thanks I get
