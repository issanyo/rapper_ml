[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm tryin', tryin', tryin' not to fail (not to fail)
I would rather go to hell
But It Feels Like (Huh)
I'm Already There (Huh)
Haters They Won't Me Gone (Huh) And If Your From The Hood (Huh)
Sing Along...
I'm Try'n, Try'n, Try'n Not To Go Hard
But I Ain't Seen No Competition In The Game So Far (Huh)
I'm Already Here (Huh)
So You Can't Make Me Leave (Huh)
Heavenly Father Please
Please Believe That I'm Try'n

{Verse 1: Ace Hood}
Yeah
And Try Is All I Got To Do
Look Into The Mirror
Told Myself
Ain't No One Hot As You
Repping For My Label Crew
We The Best
I Showed You Proof
See Me Snapping In The Both
And Wonder Why I'm So The Truth
Trying To Keep My Fuckin Cool
Sick Of All The Gossip News
Hustle Is Just An Under Statement
I Just Paly My Nearly Do
Heard They Want Me Out Of Here
Sorry It's My Time Of Year
Waiting My Whole Life For This
God The Man Who Bought Me Here
Tryna Feed My Family Though
Counting On That Seed To Blow
Fuck Your Expectations
I Don't Already Exceded Those
Ask Me Why Mama Cried
Wonder Why My Dady Lied
Told My Family To Wipe Their Tears
That's One Thing That I Can't Deny

{Hook}

{Verse 2: Ace Hood}
Yeah
And Fuck That Try'n I Got To Win
Just Go The News I'm Having Baby Twins
Lord Please Forgive Me For My Recent Sins
And Thank You Jesus For My Recent Trim
Witness My Record Going Top 10
And I'm Never Stoping
I'm Just Winning Caught My Second Win
In The Back Bone Of That Bull
Everybody Know That I Do It
They Say Hes Dope But I New It
You Had A Chance But You Blew It
And I Won't Stop Till I Get Mine
Every Peny, Every Dime
Every Ball, Every Line
Don't Grind, Don't Shine
Going To Hard When It's About Mine
Thinking In A Quit Have You Lost Your Mind
Got Me A Coop With The Top Down
I'm The King Of My Block Now
