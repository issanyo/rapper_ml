[Intro: Red Cafe (T-Pain)]
(Hey, hey, oooooohhhhhh, ooooohhhh)
Izzr, huh... (Hey, hey)

[Chorus: T-Pain (Red Cafe)]
I'm feelin' good than a muh'fucka
I got my ice on, I might go out tonight
I'm feelin' la, la, laaa
La la la da, la, la, laaaa, oooooohhhhhh (what else?)
I'm feelin' hood than a muh'fucka
I throw my set up, and everybody gather around
I'm feelin' la, la, laaa
La la laaaa, la, la, laaaa, oooooohhhhhh

[Verse 1: Red Cafe]
Huh, yeah
I want the life of a filthy rich golfer
Flyin' in a Aston, Panamera Porsche
E'vryday I do it, I gotta do it all good
Tell 'em what I want, never ever take the offer
Me and my lady friend, we hit the big city
I be the big dog, I'm pettin' on her kitty
Lookin' in her eyes, rubbin' on her thighs
6 minutes, watch Bruce Banner come alive
Raised as a killer, trade like a dealer
Pharmaceutical, plenty cut, no scissor
Debonair in my everyday wear
Murder black lens, my everyday stare, Izzr

[Chorus: T-Pain (Red Cafe)]
I'm feelin' good than a muh'fucka
I got my ice on, I might go out tonight
I'm feelin' la, la, laaa
La la la da, la, la, laaaa, oooooohhhhhh (what else?)
I'm feelin' hood than a muh'fucka
I throw my set up, and everybody gather around
I'm feelin' la, la, laaa
La la laaaa, la, la, laaaa, oooooohhhhhh

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
Yeah, Paparazzi get a treat when I fall through
Stories you done heard about me, probably all true
Though I'm raised fatherless, I feel marvelous
Put me on that Wayne Carter, Shawn Carter list
Rosé bottles represent how I feel
Win, win, win, don't worry that I will
Against the odds on the dirty boulevard
Either be a sucker or be forced to catch a charge
D.C., L.A., VA, GA
I'm never gon' crack, it's my word against the D.A
I go hard 'til the angels talk to me
Or 'til the great MJ sing a song to me... what else?

[Chorus: T-Pain (Red Cafe)]
I'm feelin' good than a muh'fucka
I got my ice on, I might go out tonight
I'm feelin' la, la, laaa
La la la da, la, la, laaaa, oooooohhhhhh (what else?)
I'm feelin' hood than a muh'fucka
I throw my set up, and everybody gather around
I'm feelin' la, la, laaa
La la laaaa, la, la, laaaa, oooooohhhhhh

[Verse 3: Red Cafe]
Huh, yeah
On my mama, I did it for my mama
In my entourage, there is no Johnny drama
Loyalty, honor, eight numbers, two commas
The foes can't find us, I be Osama
Now ya dog feelin' like senator Barack
President elect, what's up, I'm ready to rock
Straight from the PJ's to flyin' on P.J.'s
Everyday I celebrate, CÎROC in P.J
Step out the jet, damn, and they're wavin'
Like they love me, so now I'm wavin'
I always wanted to do it like Sean Combs
I done sold it all from product to bar codes, wallah

[Chorus: T-Pain (Red Cafe)]
I'm feelin' good than a muh'fucka
I got my ice on, I might go out tonight
I'm feelin' la, la, laaa
La la la da, la, la, laaaa, oooooohhhhhh (what else?)
I'm feelin' hood than a muh'fucka
I throw my set up, and everybody gather around
I'm feelin' la, la, laaa
La la laaaa, la, la, laaaa, oooooohhhhhh
