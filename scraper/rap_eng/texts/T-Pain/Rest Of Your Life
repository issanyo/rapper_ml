[Verse 1]
All you gotta do is take that first step
But don't rush it, baby, take your time
I just wanna be the first one to welcome you
To the rest of your life, oh

[Refrain]
To the rest of your life
Oh, to the rest of your life

[Verse 2]
Baby, take my hand, we'll go
All day and all night long
And then we'll pull up with the top down
And the gas tank filled up playin' yo favorite song

[Chorus]
And it goes like
And it goes like
Oh, and it goes like
Oh, this is the rest of your life
And it goes like
And it goes like
Oh, and it goes like
Oh, this is the rest of your life

[Verse 3]
Oooh, do what you wanna do girl, we ain't got no plans
Just keep on dancing, don't think about anything, open up your hands
You deserve all the best of feelings
High on life, we dance on the ceiling
And now everything's alright for the rest of your life

[Refrain]
Oh, to the rest of your life
Oh, this is the rest of your life

[Verse 4]
Baby take my hand, we'll be a two piece band
All day and all night long
And then we'll pull up with the top down
You don't want it to stop now
It's your favorite song

[Chorus]
And it goes like
And it goes like
Ohhhh, and it goes like
Ohhh, this is the rest of your life
And it goes like
And it goes like
Ohhhh, and it goes like
Ohhh, this is the rest of your life
