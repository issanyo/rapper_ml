[Intro]
Man, it's gonna go off
Real niggas fuckin' with this one
Couple of Henney, I'm ready to go
Make sure you fake niggas listen

[Verse 1]
Why is you mad? Why is you pissed?
Is it cause you living like that?
Is it cause I'm living like this?
Is it cause I've been on my job
Is it cause you ain't doin' shit?
Is it 'cause I walk out the jewelry store with this ridiculous shit on my wrist
I got no time to be takin' my eye off the ball
You said you wasn't mad but it look like you is after all
Holla at me later, put that shit on my tab
Oh, now you a hater? I just sit back and laugh
But first let me dab
Look how much I give a shit
Flames on everything Pain saying, my shit is lit
Same thing from befo', bruh
My chain hang to the flo', bruh
This for you niggas that thought it was over

[Hook]
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Money long, Cadillac
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When your money strong, they get mad at that
So dab and laugh
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Put my niggas on, they got Caddilacs
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When that money gone, they wish they can have it back
So dab and laugh

[Verse 2]
Why is you mad? Why is you pissed?
Is it cause you living like that?
Is it cause I'm living like this?
Is it cause I've been on my job
Is it cause you ain't doin' shit?
Is it 'cause I walk out the jewelry store with this ridiculous shit on my wrist
I got plenty reason for you niggas to back up off me
All of these flavors in the world, and you just gon' choose to be salty
I'm tryin' to eat and you just a target
Illuminappy, boy, look what you started
But first let me dab
Soon as I walk in the door
I'm probably gon' do somethin' that's just gon' piss a bitch off even more
Same thing from befo', bruh
My chain hang to the flo', bruh
Just stay off yo laptop and this can be over

[Hook]
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Money long, Cadillac
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When your money strong, they get mad at that
So dab and laugh
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Put my niggas on, they got Caddilacs
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When that money gone, they wish they can have it back
So dab and laugh
Laugh and dab, laugh and dab
Put my niggas on, they got Caddilacs
When your money strong, they get mad at that
When that money gone, they wish they can have it back
So dab and laugh
