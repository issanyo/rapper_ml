[Verse]
Baby, I can look in the mirror and see
That I'm not the best looking man in the world, the world, the world
But if you can look past that in me
You'll see, girl, I'm the kind of man that takes care of his girl, his girl, his girl
You've been looking for love now, in all
In all the wrong places, I know, I know
I know what you're thinking of now, with all
With all these smiling faces, I know, know
You keep on wearing what you're wearing
And go for the best looking one that's staring
No, that's not right
'Cause you just passed the love of your life, I don't understand
Do you want something to look at?
Or do you want a man, man, man

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't have to look like him, to love you like me, me, me
I don't have to look like him, to love you like me, me, me
I probably fuck better than him and love you like me, me, me
I don't have to look like him, to love you, I, love you I love you, I love you, I, I love you, I love you, I love you like me
