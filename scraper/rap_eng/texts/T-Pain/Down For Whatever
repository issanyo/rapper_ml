[Sample: Latarian Milton]
I wanted to do hoodrat stuff with my friends!

[Intro]
Yeah

Mama tonight well I might get ignant!
Alright, look!

[Verse 1: Friedy Baby]
Mama tonight, well I might get ignorant
It's going down like it's bait and I'm fishing
I'm on a mission, and my judgement's missing
You can't tell me nothin! Well you can but I won't listen

Standing on the speakers
I'm yelling, I got my shirt off
Off of 10 hits of that Kraken
My girls just sipping a Smirnoff

See these are charity bars
I'm giving em out for free!
But pretty soon you can call me iTunes Fried!

[Pre-Hook]
You want to turn it up?
Let's take a shot!
You wanna drink a little?
Girl I'm tryna drink a lot!

See they just want to judge you!
I just want to love you!
So come a little closer little mama
Let me hug you!

[Hook]
I'm talking, man I'm talking about
C-C-Cardi, L-L-Loko, Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Champagne, Kraken
I'm down for whatever
Down for whatever
Down for whatever
Little mama tonight what's happening?

C-C-Cardi, L-L-Loko, Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Champagne, Kraken
I'm down for whatever
Down for whatever
Down for whatever
Little mama tonight what's happening?

[Verse 2: Friedy Baby]
Always in a rush
Always on the run
Work you got a ton
Never time for fun
But! Baby please!
Just give me a minute
If you let me start, bet you beg me to finish!

See you remind me of my pink muscato
Or, maybe you could be my sweet rose
See, see you're something like a runway model
Any other dude it'd be no way jose!

Cause', these dudes are on you like bugs in the summer
You swat, 1 away and here comes another!
1,2,3,4,5,6 and his brother!
No manners!
Who are all these kids mothers?!

See I got a lot of Q's about that grade A, A!
Like how the hell'd you fit that in those J-E-A-N-S
Just envision all new shit!
That's whats next, see that's what's best!
They didn't Even See The acronym
Thats a T-E-S-T, oh that's a mess!
Oh my god!
This kid is crazy someone applaud like
Someone applaud like...

[Pre-Hook]
You want to turn it up?
Let's take a shot!
You wanna drink a little?
Girl I'm tryna drink a lot!

See they just want to judge you!
I just want to love you!
So come a little closer little mama
Let me hug you!

[Hook]
I'm talking, man I'm talking about
C-C-Cardi, L-L-Loko, Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Champagne, Kraken
I'm down for whatever
Down for whatever
Down for whatever
Little mama tonight what's happening?

C-C-Cardi, L-L-Loko, Ch-Ch-Ch-Ch-Champagne, Kraken
I'm down for whatever
Down for whatever
Down for whatever
Little mama tonight what's happening?

[Outro]

Little baby don't you say maybe
T-U, T-U, Let's go crazy!
Little baby don't you say maybe
T-U, T-U, Let's go crazy!

Bounce

It's Friedy Baby!
It's Friedy Baby!
Uh, you want to turn it up?

[Latarian Milton]
I wanted to do it because it's fun
It's fun to do bad things
