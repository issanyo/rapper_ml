[Verse 1: Young Cash]
Put your hands up... Put your hands up
I can't hear you...C'mon
Keep the party goin', shake them titties, bounce that ass baby
Throw your hood up, Everybody go crazy
If they shut it down he won't be a happy dude
Cause when the party stop Freaknik turn to maggot food
And these faggot dudes they can't stop all a y'all
So tear this bitch up and blame it on the alcohol
So put some fire on that ass and love that weed
And let your truck bam till' you disturbin' the peace
Lit up your fire in the sky if you packing your heat
For Freaknik we gon' cause ruckus in the streets
Matter fact somebody gon' have to call the police
Tell em' I'm right here on the stage if they lookin' for me

[Rick Ross]
Pefected my flow, I did it for us
Walkin' to school or catchin' the bus
My pants sag, It's cos I'm so hood
Sweet tea mob, We up to no good
I bought the ice cream, i bought the hot sasha
I bought potatoe chips, but now its Red Lobster
Me n' all my patners, We did it real big
I spent 200 dollars, We did it real big
I'm talking Freaknik, I popped my first bottle
I met my first groupie, lap dance, to top model
It's Big Uzi, I got a big Uzi
Well not a Big Uzi, I got a lil Uzi
I wanna big name, I wanna big chain
Put my face on it, They think I'm insane
But we rule the world, We came a long way
I thought we'd never make, Man we came a long way

[T-Pain]
Oh I, People do it for you, and you, and you
I can hear your voice come through, through, through
They don't want us to do we do, do, do
That's why we do it, That's why we do it (Girl)
That's why we do it, That's why we do it
That's why we do it, That's why we do it
I'mma keep on goin' for you, and you, and you
That's how we do it, That's how we do it

Thats how we do it
Thats why we do it
Thats why we do it
Thats why we do it
