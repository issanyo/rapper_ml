[Refrain: Dakota]
Dreams can come true
Dreams can come true

[Verse 1: Dakota]
Move a step closer you know that I want you
I can tell by your eyes that you want me too
Just a question of time I knew we'd be together
And that you'd be mine I want you here forever

[Pre-Chorus: Dakota]
Do you hear what I'm saying gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you're here but I know that you're real
I know what I want and baby it's you
I can't deny my feelings because they are true

[Chorus: Dakota]
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong

Dreams can come true
Look at me babe I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong

[Verse 2: Dakota]
I've seen you sometimes on your own and in crowds
I knew I had to have you my hopes didn't let me down
Now you're by my side and I feel so good
I've nothing to hide don't feel that I ever could

[Pre-Chorus: Dakota]
Do you hear what I'm saying gotta say how I feel
I can't believe you're here but I know that you're real
I know what I want, and baby it's you
I can't deny my feelings because they are true

[Chorus: Dakota]
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong

Dreams can come true
Look at me babe I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong

[Post-Chorus: T-Pain]
You know you got to have fun
You know you got to be strong

[Bridge: T-Pain]
Hey, I don't wanna feel what it feels like to miss you, just wanna kiss you
I can dance here all night, with you it's not an issue
It'll be a nightmare if I don't see you right there
'Cos if I got you, then I got the proof and I'm telling you that dreams do come true

[Chorus: Dakota & T-Pain]
Dreams can come true
Look at me babe I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope
You know you gotta be strong (know we got)

Dreams can come true
Look at me babe I'm with you
You know you gotta have hope (you know you got to have fun)
You know you gotta be strong (you know you got to be strong)

[Ending: T-Pain]
You know you got to have fun
You know you got to be strong
