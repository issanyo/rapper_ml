[Intro:]
Yeah, doc
It's your homeboy Teddy
AKA Take a Drank Em Under The Table and the table is so low
I done made up some brand new dranks, man
I ain't a genius but I just made some genius shit
U tryna get fucked up fast?
Come with me, homie

See see see see see
I made this for all my alcoholics
Put your cup in the air
I want you to do what you do
Go have fun, who gives a fuck what you wear
Shawty just sit back and relax
Sip on this new drink that I made
(Take a sip of this, yup take a sip)
Just take a shot before you walk up in the party
Guaranteed to get laid

[Chorus:]
'Cause she'll be hangin, swangin, dranking two kinds of Patron
I done mixed up silver and gold
I done mixed up silver and gold
I'm trying to get drunk up in this party
Somebody gon' have to carry me home
I done mixed up silver and gold
We done mixed up silver and gold

[Verse 2:]
Got me leaning (got me leaning)
Drinking and driving (drinkin and driving)
Shawty been fiending (shawty been fiending)
She say she want me inside her, but that's a no-no, no-no
No, I can't do that (why?)
'Cause shawty, I'm taken (Shawty, I'm taken)
Just take a sip of this drank that and we'll be
Hanging, swanging, hanging, swanging

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I Probably shouldn't do this (probably shouldn't do this)
It's bad for my body
But i gotta take just one more shot (one more shot)
'Cause every time I do this
I'm the life of the party
And i gotta show everyone what I got
Hanging, hanging, hanging...

[Chorus]
