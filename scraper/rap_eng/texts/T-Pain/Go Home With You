[Akon] Convict

[Kardinal Offishall] Jay

[Choir] And let the choir sing (chanting)

[Kardinal Offishall] Still got a couple seconds left, you knowa mean

(chanting)

[Kardinal Offishall] See your ass on the dancefloor

[Verse 1: Kardinal Offishall]

Hey yo!
They call me Kardie
F (...) Ferrari
Niggas scream...whenever they see me in the party
Everything's official
You ain't gotta ask

You need a late pass
Ya'll need sip punani
Bottle to the head
And I ain't sayin' much you could be one of the feds
We stay connected, above the clouds
We don't talk much but the movement speak loud, nigga
Gotta respect that
There's no choice
I'm Mr. Agua, watchadata, get moist
Girlfriend caught me kickin' with the crew
She my late night friend, butchall

[Hook: T-Pain]

I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you
(Now hear the choir say) I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you

Kardinal Offishall: (chuckles) And we get back at 'em

[Verse 2: Kardinal Offishall]
They call me Kardie
Mr. Gasoline
World turn to (FIRE!)
When they see me steppin' on the scene
And we don't buy it unless we got it ten times
This is real life, we ain't just sitting on the rhymes man
Guaranteed if you're a poser you lose
And we the future, let's hear it for the brand new fusion
Anybody can get it, there is no exclusion
'Nuff questions, leading to the same conclusion
Gangsters is Gangsters
Nigga be you who be
I'm a bad man, but they still not bad likawe
I never chase 'em
I let 'em choose
At the end of the night they say

[Hook: T-Pain]

I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you
(Now hear the choir say) I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you

[Kardinal Offishall] And the world say
(Choir chants)
[Kardinal Offishall] And the world say
(More chants)
[Kardinal Offishall] And the whole wide world say
And the world say
Lemme talk for a second

[Third Verse: Kardinal Offishall]

Ey Yo

They call me Kardie
Mr. Evolution
Now you can dance while you think about the revolution
And while you vex having delusions of persecution
I'mma stay flawless, an instrument of execution
Out of many still grows one people
Justice (...) still remain unequal
And I'm a diamond in the dirt
And there is no sequel
Many try but they cannot replicate what we do
Hear evil, speak that evil
Speak good to the hood, there is no retrieval
Think about while you sippin' on your (...)
If my words could talk they'd say

[Hook: T-Pain]

I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you
(Now hear the choir say) I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you
I wanna go home with you

Now hear the choir say
(chanting)
Now hear the choir say

Kardinal Offishall: Black Jay
