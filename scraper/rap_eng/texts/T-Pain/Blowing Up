Ahhh (ahhh) ha (hahhh)

[T-Pain]
You get me so enegetic
Everything's copacetic
Slide with a nigga I'm so electric
And baby girl you can bet it all
And ain't got to sweat it
Go home, put on that dress let's
Go out there'll be no more stressin
And girl tonight I'm gon' be yo' dog

[Ciara] + (T-Pain)
Ohhhhhh, I like it - you know I'm the type to have fun
Slow wind it - you can jump on in if you want
(Baby girl, don't fight it - you know tonight is your night and)
(We can go use it, don't abuse it cause you're like techno music)
Electronica

[Hook: T-Pain] + (Ciara)
I got to be real girl, I don't feel like growin up
The bartender fillin up my cup; if you lookin for love, girl you're in luck
Cause I'm blowin up (blowin up), I'm blowin up (blowin up)
I'm blowin up (blowin up), bartender fillin up my cup cause I'm blowin up (blowin up)
