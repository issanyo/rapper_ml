[Verse 1]
You be like...
Why she gotta like all of your posts?
Why you in there posin' with them hoes?
And I be like, damn though
Why you in there goin' through my phone?
Bitch I told you take your ass home
And you be like...
That ain't, that ain't... none of my business
That ain't, that ain't... none of my biz
And I be like do it then

[Refrain]
Gon', gon', gon', gon', gon', gon' gon' do it then
I'ma let you gon', gon', gon', gon', gon', gon' gon' do it then
Gon' do it
I'ma let you stress yourself out
Move over to the next, pull the best out
This ain't no test
'Cause baby if it was you would have to confess

[Chorus]
That you don't know shit
Do you babe?
You be gettin' wrong answers, aww yeah
You be gettin' wrong answers, aww yeah
I see the molly got you gone
'Cause you don't know shit
Do you babe?
You be gettin' wrong answers, aww yeah
You be gettin' wrong answers
I'ma move on to a slow dancer

[Verse 2]
Baby I'm all about that pussy
But your pussy ain't gon' really make me chill, is it?
Lookin' at you like, oh really? Oh really?
Havin' real hair, that don't make you real, can I...
Hit you with the sauce in the mornin'?
I put this fuckin' meat right on your grill, baby
I'll show you the stroke, put you on it
I'll show you how to make some fuckin' real paper, like...
Oh, oh, I be cookin' too much not to eat
If you ain't helpin' me get on my feet
Then let's see how your shit do in the streets
I be like ooh, ooh
You say you gon' key up all my cars
That ain't nothin' but a paint job
But when all my bad bitches show up at your job
I'ma look at you like...

[Refrain]
Gon', gon', gon', gon', gon', gon' gon' do it then
I'ma let you gon', gon', gon', gon', gon', gon' gon' do it then
Bitch you must be stupid
I'ma let you stress yourself out
Move over to the next, pull the best out
This ain't no test
'Cause baby if it was you would have to confess

[Chorus]
That you don't know shit
Do you babe?
You be gettin' wrong answers, aww yeah
You be gettin' wrong answers, aww yeah

[Verse 3]
You be like... why's he on that lame shit?
And I be like, you be on the same shit
On the Gram with that stupid Boomerang shit
You need to stop it with the games, bitch, yeah
What did you think was gon' happen?
All you do is push a nigga off ya
Sittin' at the crib with a dry dick
Now I can't think of nothin' more awful, baby
You be poppin', poppin', poppin'
You be poppin', ho
You be poppin' for them niggas at the night show, baby
Just boppin', boppin', boppin'
But you be all up in my business, shit, I might go crazy now
How 'bout you worry 'bout that shit somewhere else?
Stop askin' me 'bout them bitches in there
Won't you go find out that shit for yourself?
'Cause I don't give a fuck, I don't care
'Cause I'ma tell ya
'Cause I'ma tell ya

[Refrain]
Gon', gon', gon', gon', gon', gon' gon' do it then
Bet you won't do it
I'ma let you gon', gon', gon', gon', gon', gon' gon' do it then
Bet you won't do it
I'ma let you stress yourself out
Move over to the next, pull the best out
This ain't no test
'Cause baby if it was you would have to confess

[Chorus]
That you don't know shit
Do you babe?
You be gettin' wrong answers, aww yeah
You be gettin' wrong answers, aww yeah

'Cause you don't know shit
Do you babe?
