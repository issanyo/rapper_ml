[Intro]
No rush (Yeah)
No rush at all (Yeah)
No rush (Yeah)
No rush at all (Yeah)
Ay

[Verse 1]
You're a bad bitch and I'm an asshole
With a habit of fuckin' mad hoes
'Til you came around and made it all slow down
Sweatin' you now, I wanna take you down
And I see now that you won't let me down
So I want you to know

[Chorus]
There's no rush, no rush, babe
No rush (no rush at all), no rush, babe
No rush, no rush, babe
No rush (no rush at all), no rush
Baby, take your time and I'll be here waiting, you know
(No rush, no rush
No rush, no)

[Verse 2]
You're a bad bitch and I'm an asshole
What a difference, still a match though
It don't matter 'cause you got my heart on locked down
Sweatin' you now, I wanna take you down
And I see now that you won't let me down
And I want you to know

[Chorus]
There's no rush, no rush, babe
No rush (no rush at all), no rush, babe
No rush, no rush, babe
No rush (no rush at all), no rush
Baby, take your time and I'll be here waiting, you know
(No rush, no rush
No rush, no)

[Outro]
Baby ain't no rush at all (No rush)
Oh (No rush at all)
Oh (No rush)
Oh (No rush at all)
Baby, take your time and I'll be here waiting, oh
(No rush)
Baby ain't no rush at all (No rush)
Yeah, yeah (No rush at all)
Yeah, yeah (No rush)
Ouuh (No rush at all)
Baby ain't no rush at all
