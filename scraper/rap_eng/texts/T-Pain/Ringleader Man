[T-Pain]
Heyyyy!
We gon' have a ripping good time
Just hit, rewind
And you can see I'm far too crazy
My rhythms and rhymes
Keep niggas in line
Cause now, is not the time, to be lazy
I'm the ringleader man
A cane in my hand
And a iced out top hat on my head
Ain't you tired of that whackness
Sick of this whack shit
Wouldn't you like some of me instead?
The ringleader man!

[Hook]
This is my circus I'm workin
I can flip this whole game with one hand
The ringleader man
I knowww, it's a fact
That you'd rather just have some of me instead
The ringleader man
Hehe... the ringleader man
Hehe...

[T-Pain]
Heyyyy!
This industry is my circus
I know that it hurts just
Sit back and take pain like I used to
And I'm tryin to stop cursin
But, I don't give a fuck
I'm gon' curse you with lyrical voodoo
I'm the ringleader man
You can't understand
The shit that comes out of my head
But you like all that whackness
Lovin all that whack shit
I'd rather just say fuck you instead
The ringleader man!

[Hook]
This is my circus I'm workin
I can flip this whole game with one hand
The ringleader man
I knowww, it's a fact
That you'd rather just have some of me instead
The ringleader man
Hehe... the ringleader man
Hehe...
