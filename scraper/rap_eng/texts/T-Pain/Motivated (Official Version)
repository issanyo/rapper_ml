[Intro: T-Pain]
Yeah, yeah, BOOM
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Throw me in a cage with a lion and a bear (Imma kill 'em)
That motivation I ain't lyin', I swear (I'm the nigga)
I got my ear to the streets, back to the bullshit
I'm tryna eat, I'm on my bullshit
Homie, I can't listen to what you sayin', stop talkin
Betta watch the way you talk to my clan
Homie, start walkin'
Wait a minute when a nigga really get it, Imma go off
I’m gotta prove it to him
I think Im Big Meech, Larry Hoover

[Hook: T-Pain]
I'm tryna eat, you tryna sleep
If you a dog, then Imma beast
And the beat goes
(Beatbox)
I know you hate it
(Beatbox)
Here go my motivation, bruh
I'm with my dogs
Fuck us, no nigga fuck ya’ll
And the beat goes
(Beatbox)
If you know they hate it
(Beatbox)
Let me get you motivated
