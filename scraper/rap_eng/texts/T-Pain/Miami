[Intro: Ace Hood]
Shit, at some point, niggas gotta grow up
Ace. Pain, what up?

[Pre Hook: T-Pain]
If you ain't got your shit together, then you can't let her know what's up
Oh, you got to do better, she wanna be alone forever, oh no
She wanna know

[Hook: T-Pain]
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
You been there too many times, she know something's wrong
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
And every time that you go, you stay way too long
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
There's too many strip clubs, too many strippers
When you get back, she go through your phone
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
Probably getting your dick sucked, who you done picked up
When she know you did something wrong
How many times you gon' go?
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
You know you gotta believe me, I put that shit on my kids, yeah
You know when them bitches see me, they just wanna spin on my dick, yeah
I ain't no sexy nigga but them bitches recognize I handle my biz, yeah
They know that I'm eating real good, they just want in on the meals, yeah
What the fuck I need a thot for, when I got a bitch that'll rock on me
Suck that dick till she get lockjaw, you tell ya girlfriend to come ride on this dick
Right when the shit bout to pop off
Put a shotgun in your mouth with a skrilla
Fuck around, get your shit rocked off
My bitch my shooter, my hitter, yeah
Peer pressure make me feel less of a real nigga
And that's as real as it get
Iridescent diamonds in my ear done shiny
Broke bitches tryin' to fuck me and dip
Snakes in the grass, fake big ol' ass, from a mile away you smell 'em
I need a time machine so I can go find my younger self and tell him

[Pre Hook: T-Pain]
If you ain't got your shit together, then you can't let her know what's up
Oh, you got to do better, she wanna be alone forever, oh no
She wanna know

[Hook: T-Pain]
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
You been there too many times, she know something's wrong
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
And every time that you go, you stay way too long
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
There's too many strip clubs, too many strippers
When you get back, she go through your phone
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
Probably getting your dick sucked, who you done picked up
When she know you did something wrong
How many times you gon' go?

[Verse 2: Ace Hood]
How many times you gon ask
How many time you gon pat, for real
Maybe you need to relax
Couple of days I'm right back, chill
You know I'd never deceive you
Never, would never mistreat you, no
I got a queen and a keeper
She don't belong in the bleachers
Bitches be trying to starters
They go to pressing me harder
Hoping I come through and slaughter
They wanna ride it like I was a Caddy
While calling me daddy like I was the father
Honestly speaking, I'm unimpressed
Thotties will come with a ton of stress
When you connect in the mind, your body, and soul
It makes for some greater sex
If she ain't your homie, your lover, your friend
You might want to go get your feelings back
With the seal and back
Imported my watch in a coniac
I keeping it real, you niggas living on lies
I look her right in her eyes
I done came up on a prize
I gotta stay on my jog
I gotta grow and evolve
People will play on your weakness
Look at what happened to Rome

[Pre Hook: T-Pain]
If you ain't got your shit together, then you can't let her know what's up
Oh, you got to do better, she wanna be alone forever, oh no
She wanna know

[Hook: T-Pain]
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
You been there too many times, she know something's wrong
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
And every time that you go, you stay way too long
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
There's too many strip clubs, too many strippers
When you get back, she go through your phone
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
Probably getting your dick sucked, who you done picked up
When she know you did something wrong
How many times you gon' go?
