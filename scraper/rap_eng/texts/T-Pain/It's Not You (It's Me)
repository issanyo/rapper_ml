[Intro: T-Pain & Pitbull]
It's not you
T-Pain, Mr. Worldwide
Not you
It's not you, woah
Not you

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I know I be, all up in these clubs
Playin' with these girls, travelin' around the world
I know I be, messin with your feelings
Money to the ceiling, it falls down to the floor
I know I be, fist pump, fist pump
Fist pumpin' like a champ
The music got me amped, I'm catchin' leg cramps
I know I be, messin' us up, and that's all that I do
So if we break up
I can tell you it's not you

[Chorus: T-Pain]
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
And I know I be trippin'
But I need you to listen, it's not you
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
Even though I'm messin' up
I can't stay out of this club, it's not you

[Chorus x2: Pitbull & T-Pain]
Baby it's not you it's me
It's not you it's me
Baby it's not you it's me
It's the dog in me (It's not you)

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
I know we be, kissin' all in public
And girl I love it, can't get enough of it
But girl lately, you been talkin' down
Keep me with a frown, I can't keep you around
I know I be, fist pump, fist pump
Fist pumpin' like a pro
Girl you already know, you've seen me do this before
I know I be, messin' us up, but you can't tell me what to do
So if we break up
I can tell you it's not you

[Chorus x2: T-Pain]
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
And I know I be trippin'
But I need you to listen, it's not you
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
Even though I'm messin' up
I can't stay out of this club, it's not you

[Chorus x2: Pitbull]
Baby it's not you it's me
It's not you it's me
Baby it's not you it's me
It's the dog in me

[Verse 3: Pitbull]
They slip, I grip, she dip, I dip
I hit, no text, no twitter
That girls so bad, that thing so thick
And Pain, you can bet I get her
Even the girls wanna hit her
So you know Imma take one with us
More for Voli, pour it like water
For 'sho fill the club like New Orleans
She this, she that, her ass so fat
And her kitty cat's down for a doggin'
Mira mamita Â¿verdad que tu 'tas linda?
Rica y bonita
Pero la verdad que yo quiero tu amiguita
It's not you, it's me; I'm sorry, dale!

[Bridge: T-Pain]
So if we break up
I can tell you it's not you

[Chorus x2: T-Pain]
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
And I know I be trippin'
But I need you to listen, it's not you
Not you, it's not you
Not you, it's me
Even though I'm messin' up
I can't stay out of this club, it's not you
