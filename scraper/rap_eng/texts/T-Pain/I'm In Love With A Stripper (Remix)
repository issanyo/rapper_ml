I Need to get her over to my crib and do that night thang
Cause I'm N Luv wit a stripper

[Chorus X2]
She poppin she rollin she rollin
She climbin that pole and

She trippin she playin she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl I'm stayin

She's every man's dream
She's God's gift to Earth
Women they love 'em too
That's what you call a women's worth
See I love all the strippers
Because they show me love
They know I never pay as free whenever I hit the club
But I can't even lie
The girls are here so fly
She slidin' up and down that pole got me mesmerized
Mike Jones don't ever trick
But god damn she thick
I can't lie, I must admit
I'm in love with a stripper

[Chorus x2]
She poppin she rollin she rollin
She climbin that pole and
I'm N Luv with a stripper

Like n the way she break it down I see u girl

I Need to get her over to my crib and do that night thang
Cause I'm N Luv Wit a Stripper

[Chorus x2]
She poppin she rollin she rollin
