That's a pretty thing when you turn around
Girl, the way you sway I'm in trouble now
Won't you bring it close? Put that thing right here
Right here, put it right here
I just like to lend money through the top
So throw it in the air because I got a lot
We can make a move over to the spot, for some pillow talk
That's what I really want

Because when you walk it, like you talk it
It's no problem, ain't no other
Girl, can't solve em'

And I like it
Girl, you know you finer than Versace
Youse a blessing
From the heavens
And when you take it off at the end of the day

And you're li-li-like a first prize
Because baby girl you're a winner
She rock it, roll it
