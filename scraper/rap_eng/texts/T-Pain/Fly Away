[Verse 1]
I wish I can grow some wings
And get up out of this situation
I do it with no hesitation, yeah
I wish I can know those things
That everybody else knows
It's my decision, don't need permission to

[Chorus]
Fly away (way), fly away (way)
I go through this everyday
So I fly away (way)
I can fly away (way), fly away (way)
No one listen to what I say
So I fly away

[Verse 2]
Somebody told me (told me), today was my day (day)
They see me on the big screen and they see me on the stage
And it must be true, 'Cause, here I am, here I am baby
I wanna thank you

[Chorus]

[Bridge: 2x]
I go through this everyday
So I fly away (way)
And I go through this everyday
So I fly away, fly away yeah
Fly way yeah
No one listen to what I say
So I fly away (way)
