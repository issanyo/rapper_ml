Yeah... we've been in this situation
Like once or twice, before now
And I liked it, cause you liked it
Yeah... sweet anticipation, heh
So very nice, but how
Do we fight it, no fight it
What we feel is so, natural
We pretty much, have to go
With the flow (the flow)
Of yo' body, shawty
We can do whatever you, wanna do tonight
Somehow I know what it is, and I'm so excited

Cause if I do it, to youuuuu
Uh... then you gotta do it, to meeeee
And if we do what I think we're gonna dooooo
Heh, shawty that'll be fuckin sweeeeet
Hehe, uhh
And baby you know it, heh
You know you know it
I know you know it
Ooh!

Yeah, let me do your dissertation
I know everything, there is to know
And I'd be delighted, to write it
Yeahhh, bottom line you're just the greatest
Have you ever heard, of a love, T.K.O.?
Well girl you're Mike Tyson, and I like it
And I must be psychic
Cause I knew what you were gonna do right before you did it
Right when I got in it I was freeeeeee
Yeah, but I'ma be quiet
You know I love makin love to you
It's like a new dimension, when you get to kissin on meeeeeee

Cause you know if I do it, to youuuuuu
You know you gotta do it, to meeeeeee
And if we do what I think we're gonna doooooo
Baby that'll be fuckin sweeeeeet
Oooh, and I know you know it
Mmm, damn, you know it
I know you know it
