She gave you molly, gotta do it
Syrup in my cup, time to screw it
Gon be a freak girl, you can do it
Bring a bad bitch so we can get to it

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
The bass hit, through the crib
In the basement, take this pill
I assure you when you do it's gonna make you feel special
Don't feel disrespected, girl, this ain't no peer pressure
