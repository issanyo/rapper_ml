[Intro]
Some people call it being soft
Some people call it bitching out
I call it me being the bigger man then you think I am

[Chorus]
I got the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
And unless I want to let it all go
I just gotta be more careful x3

[Verse 1]
Yeah, and you already know I feel
Shit, I almost forgot how good the lies feel
'Cause when you think you're on top if the world
You come to realize your standing in some high heels
So that Nuvo got me popping shit
And even worse nobody around me is knocking it
'Cause they don’t say what's on their mind
Until I say what's on mine, and now they trying just to stop the shit
Cause to them it's just the ego
But I'm a straight shooter so they call me for the free throws
Now most days rocking hard with the chicos
But I still got a nine and some green like Geno
And in order for me to live right, I gotta change
But after five years of being hated on I got deranged
I live good, but homie I ain’t got the range
I make the 6-4 go up and down like the stock exchange

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Okay, they say my girl look regular
But having a bad bitch don’t make you better bruh
And she don’t diss me like your bitch ass
She’ll let me fuck your girl and even help me spread that bitch ass
And you want me to fuck the best girl
But the model hoes get sideways like a s curl
And I don’t get attitude I get respect
'Cause she was with me three years before I got a check
So I can keep my girl and live happy on the boat
Or a freaky fine bitch that’ll have me going broke
But I'll never leaver her, 'cause she a go-getter
Even if she go to Hell, I'mma go with her
And you bitches hating on her because she light skinned
But look at the fucking industry that I'm in
I'm the only artist with dark girls in my videos
So a bad attitude and a dick is what I give you hoes

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Alright, so lets talk about the Jay shit
Some days I wish that I ain't never say shit
And Diddy said there ain't no excuse for what I did
But I felt like he was knocking the same shit that feed my kids
I do music 'cause I need it to make my world spin
So when you down it, it's like you dissing my girlfriend
And Jay one of the only niggas I hear bringing it
So I didn’t think that he would even entertain the shit
Because entertainment is see through
But if you really feel like I'm dead, then nigga me too
I ain't trying to write your rhyme
But you could’ve skip one DJ
And all you had to say was "T-pain, we cool."
But by all mean don’t take it as a diss or hating
I just want to explain my side of the situation
So if you knew just how much respect I had
You know I'm a real nigga when I say...my bad

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah
I'm just a real nigga man
I don’t sugar coat nothing
Anything I say I stand by it so
You can hear my reasons and you can think what you think but
I'm gonna be a real nigga regardless of what's going on
You know what I'm saying?
Revolver, coming at you man
Yeah, Nappy Boy
