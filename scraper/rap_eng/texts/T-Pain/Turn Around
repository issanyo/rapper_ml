And I can't wait to hear everything that you have to say, have to say
'cause baby I feel good
[?] baby I done came here from a long day, from a long night
And there ain't no such thing as you rubbing me the wrong way, wrong way
And you ain't from around noticed you done came a long way, long way
And baby that's why it feels good

[Hook]
I just came to spend my dollars
Turn around, turn around
Walk up in the club and and I'm burning down (dollars)
Turn around, turn around

Turn around, turn around
I'm gonna be here popping rubber bands, baby I feel good
Baby, I'm just here to spend my dollars
Turn around, turn around

Turn around, turn around
