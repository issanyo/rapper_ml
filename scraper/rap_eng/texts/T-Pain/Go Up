[Intro: 24hrs]
24hrs and you know it's T-Pain
Oh woah
Let me see you do that, right now

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Go up
Then come down
Go up
Then come down
Go up
Then come down
Go up
Then come down

[Post-Chorus: 24hrs + T-Pain]
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
Then come down

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
Ay, Twenty, you know that I been working hard
Climbing up and down that pole, whew
Clothes come off, spend a whole bunch of money
If you kiss her, I'mma blow more money
You know I like what you do
I'm not gon' ever, judge you
Drop top two seater, just us two
I came, tonight, to find your type
I'm Twenty, this no hype
Umbrella, umbrella, let's make it rain
It's 24hrs, and it's T-Pain
Just you and your friends
Go down

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Then go up
Then come down
Go up
Then come down
Go up
Then come down
Go up
Then come down

[Post-Chorus: 24hrs + T-Pain]
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
Then come down

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
I'm up in the air like that McDonalds sign, look like open legs
Girl, I been drinking straight Henny all day, put that Coke in there
You see that sunshine make me unwind, I stay woke in there
Girl, put that gun down, that ain't allowed, in the [?]
That bad little sinner, damn, that ain't enough for a nigga, how would I spend a whole million
Spend a whole million, I'm tryna show you my vision, daily threesomes with Brazilians
I'm on that west coast production shit
Tell that hoe she can suck a dick
The price just going up a bit
And you know that meat looking succulent
You ain't never lied
She wanna ride on that Pain train, said she never tried
She said me and God like the same thing, she feels so alive
But I leave her dead in the bed
And I leave the bread on her head
Tell her next time the prices better not

[Chorus: 24hrs]
Go up
Then come down
Go up
Then come down
Go up
Then come down
Go up
Then come down

[Post-Chorus: 24hrs + T-Pain]
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
I'm not judging you
Yeah, but them prices going down
Then come down
