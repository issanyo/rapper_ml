[Pre-Chorus]
You need to stop bringing your female friends around me
You know that I'ma like 'em
Give that bitch my number, tell that ho to call me and hit me up tonight, bitch

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna fuck your friend, ooh
I'ma hit it and I'll tell you when I did it
I'm just tryna fuck your friend, ooh
Don't try to block me, I'll just put her in the cockpit
Now, I'm 'bout to fuck your friend, ooh

[Verse 1]
I hit that shit in the mornin'
I hit that shit for some bread
I can tell that your friend want it
She gon' make me give her head, yeah
I met the bitch on the strip, yeah
And I just wanna feel them lips, aah
You know a nigga off the hip, aah
I might just come through and just sip, ahh
I might just come through with the 'flix, ahh
Tell your nigga he ain't really gotta trip, nah
Yeah yeah
I don't care if you're there, yeah
I'll fuck your friend right in front of you but only one of you act like you care, yeah
Don't get salty, babe
Don't tell that bitch to get off me, babe
You can stop it early cause you're awfully late
You can fuck me right when she's off me baby

[Bridge]
I'm just going with what feel good
I'm gon' fuck your friend real good
Put her on that stainless steel hood
Used to want to fuck me and you still could

[Pre-Chorus]
But, you need to stop bringing your female friends around me, you know that I'ma like 'em
Give that bitch my number, tell that ho to call me and hit me up tonight, bitch

[Chorus]
I'm just tryna fuck your friend, ooh

I'm just tryna fuck your friend, ooh
Don't try to block me, I'll just put her in the cockpit
Now, I'm 'bout to fuck your friend, ooh

[Verse 2]
I hit that shit from the back
Put it up, end up on the tail
Always backing up, never lackin'
Give me a hammer cause i nailed her, baby
Give a bitch an inch, she take a yard, baby
Let her see the keys, she'll take the car, baby
You gotta come in my room and take off ya drawls, baby
Do that thang, I'm taking it off, baby
Your friend said she wanna come stay
Baby I get it, you get it
I'm with it, you with it, let's roll

[Bridge]
I'm just going with what feel good

Put her on that stainless steel hood
Used to want to fuck me and you still could
