[Verse 1]
Who got that dro
Man I told y’all that I wasn’t gon smoke no more
You break it up, I roll
Y’all take this one, Imma smoke this one solo
Cause I, cause I bought them swishers baby oh
Don’t, don’t, don’t drop that blunt-duh-duh
I ain’t been having no fun tonight, and everything in my crib fucking up, oh no
And I don’t know what I'ma do
But as of right now I need this shit more than you

[Hook]
Cause I been tripping, and I just need to be smoking
And I might not let you hit it
Cause this bitch it got me choking
Man I been so stressed out
I done got myself into some mess now
Man this bitch been tripping, somebody call some hoes in
I don’t know what to do, but I need to be smoking
Too much shit done went wrong, don’t want to be on my phone
I need to be smoking
And I can’t even go out, because of my bank account
I need to be smoking
Too much shit done went wrong, don’t want to be on my phone
I need to be smoking
And I can’t even go out, because of my bank account

[Verse 2]
Man this that fire, this that 420, that Afghan, that loud
And we don’t want none of that trash can, bye bye
Roll one more up before this one go out
Man I don’t want to come down
Cause I got too much shit going on that I don’t want to think about
And this shit right here keep it to where I ain’t even got to drink a lot
Cause I got hoes coming over that’ll stroke this pole for the dozier
And that won’t solve none of my problems but I damn sure need this closure

[Hook]
Cause I been tripping, and I just need to be smoking
And I might not let you hit it
Cause this bitch it got me choking
Man I been so stressed out
I done got myself into some mess now
Man this bitch been tripping, somebody call some hoes in
I don’t know what to do, but I need to be smoking
Too much shit done went wrong, don’t want to be on my phone
I need to be smoking
And I can’t even go out, because of my bank account
I need to be smoking
Too much shit done went wrong, don’t want to be on my phone
I need to be smoking
And I can’t even go out, because of my bank account
