[Verse 1: Wisin]
There's something about you that I like
Something so captivating
Feels like your body belongs right next to mine
(pam-pam-pam-pam)

[Pre-Chorus: Wisin]
I'm going crazy the moves that you're making
Your body is on fire (dura, dura, eh-eh-eh)
(heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh)
I'm going crazy the moves that you're making
Your body is on fire (lo siente, dura, dura, eh-eh-eh, oooh)

[Chorus: Yandel, Wisin]
We getting closer and closer now
Just you and I
We touching slow
We letting go

We getting closer and closer now
Just you and I
We can keep it between us
Nobody has to know

(Multimillo Records)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
I've been looking for you for a while now
Oh and now, I just can't get you out of my mind
So mama just hold my hand and move your body
I'm your man, I need your body
Can I take you there (oh-oh)
Can I take you there (oh-oh)
And you can be the love of my life

[Chorus: Yandel, Wisin]
We getting closer and closer now
Just you and I
We touching slow
We letting go

We getting closer and closer now
Just you and I
We can keep it between us
Nobody has to know

(T-Pain)

[Verse 2: T-Pain, Wisin]
Man, I gotta get to her (to her)
She's the only one I want to be in my crib (crib)
Oh on my crib (crib)
Cause I think I fit with her (with her)
And I don't think she knows how beautiful she is (she is)
Oh, she is (she is)

And when the moon comes up
And the mood it feels right, we go, oh-oh
And what we do between us
We do it all night, and she knows, oh-oh
Yeah

(La Gerencia)

[Bridge: Wisin]
There's something about you that I like
Something so captivating
Feels like your body belongs Right next to mine
(pam-pam-pam-pam)

[Pre-Chorus: Wisin]
I'm going crazy the moves that you're making
Your body is on fire (dura, dura, eh-eh-eh)
(heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh-heh)
I'm going crazy the moves that you're making
Your body is on fire (lo siente, dura, dura, eh-eh-eh, oooh)

(préndelo)

[Chorus: Yandel, Wisin]
We getting closer and closer now
Just you and I (ajá)
We touching slow
We letting go

We getting closer and closer now (Los Líderes)
Just you and I
We can keep it between us
Nobody has to know
