[Verse]
I got one hundred more dollars and I'm about to go home
And I can't wait to see
The pretty thing waiting on me
I bet a hundred dollars that I ain't about to be alone
Soon as she see me
She gonna be dressed in pink

[Bridge]
Doing that dance like
All on top of the table
She gon show me what that thing made for
Dancing on the bed like
She know I love everything she do
But she say she wanna try something new

[Hook]
Pussy popping on her hands
I just came from the club and I ain't never seen nothing like this
So baby keep doing that shit
Pussy popping on her hands
Yeah
Now that's that shit be talking about
I shoulda stayed my ass in the house
Then I woulda had a hundred more dollars if I woulda stayed home

[Verse]
She do it better than the strippers
I might just tip her
I don't know what the hell I was thinking when I left you here alone
Feeling hella stupid
Maybe still wanna see you do it
Doing that dance like

[Bridge]
All on top of the table
She gon show me what that thing made for
Dancing on the bed like
She know I love everything she do
But she say she wanna try something new

[Hook]
Pussy popping on her hands
I just came from the club and I ain't never seen nothing like this
So baby keep doing that shit
Pussy popping on her hands
Yeah
Now that's that shit be talking about
I shoulda stayed my ass in the house
Then I woulda had a hundred more dollars if I woulda stayed home

[Outro]
I woulda had a hundred more dollars if I woulda stayed home
