[Intro: T-Pain & Mr. Talkbox]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, (oh yeah)
Oh yeah, (ooh yeah)
May I? (May I?)
May I? yeah
May I? May I? (ooh yeah)
All I wanna say is may I have this dance (have this dance baby)
Because I only got one last chance

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
And I ain't talking 'bout the rapper I'm just dapper in here
When I'm dabbing on these hoes, I say what's happenin' in here
You ain't gotta like me to sit on my lap up in here
You ain't gotta like me baby but you gonna ride the wave
And I'm cool, old school, you so dope
So fly, no lie, and you know

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Oh God I gotta feelin' that I'm 'bout to need a IV real quick
She ain't got to be DeJ Loaf to come and try me real quick
I do anything you want, I might just give this lil bitch one more chance

[Bridge]
Now just breathe and truly
Just breathe, all you need is one last chance

[Chorus]
So may I have this dance?
'Cause I, all I got one last chance
So just breathe

[Verse 3: Mr. Talkbox]
Oh yeah, T-Pain, let me explain
I couldn't help it, but I saw you walking into the room
You won't find me, and I caught a whiff of your sweet perfume
And you got me feeling like I wanna be in the groove
But I gotta stay focused on what I came to do
But my train of thought came rolling right back to you
You and me on that dance floor, baby come through
Touch me, let's get close
'Cause girl I want to show you a good time
If you wanna know what I'm feeling for you
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Let's dance, 'cause all you need is one more chance
Ooh baby, may I?

[Interlude]

[T-Pain]
Oh me, one more chance
Ooh baby, may I have this dance?
'Cause I only got one last chance
May I have this dance?
'Cause I only got one chance (yeah, ooh)
One chance (yeah, ooh)
One chance (yeah, ooh)

[Outro: T-Pain]
One chance
One chance
One chance
Ooh yeah
Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa
Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa
Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa
Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa
May I have this dance 'cause I only have this one chance
May I have this dance 'cause I only got this one chance
Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa
Play on playa, play on playa, play on playa
