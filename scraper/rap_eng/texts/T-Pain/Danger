[Intro]
F-Y-R-E, Pain
Ok, I ain't gotta tell ya on the track baby
Danger, danger (this shit is)
Danger, danger (this shit is)
Danger, danger, danger, danger

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm so spectacular I manufacture hits like Hit Factory
I'm on my shit so tell that bitch to get back from me
Mack black Cadillac's and G's
So many them hoes be running after me
We might need a limos worth of backseats
Cause all in my shotgun be ridin shotgun
For niggas that's looking at me wrong like a hot nun
It's obvious these dumb hoes don't get it yet
Fuckin around with Pain and get pwned on the internet
This shit I'm doing is illegal like three murders
So put'cha bread up I got beef like three burgers
Lick shots a make ya team jump like three hurdles
You niggas weird and slow and I'm smarter than Steve Urkel
See me?

[Interlude]
Danger, danger, danger, danger

[Verse 2]
Yeah, they say that boy got the bar on his neck
Advertising for other niggas and they ain't got off of the check
Cause I ain't looking for no money, I'm just cool like that
Na, now they don't teach you nothin' in yo school like that
So these niggas mad 'cause I dropped out, but I still got paid
And how I keep my face clean, but I still got maids
How I unmanaged the dreads and how I get my braids
But I'm awesome, so you can't say that shit 'bout Pain
See me?

[Interlude]
Danger, danger, danger, danger

[Verse 3]
I'm a keep it going like a marathon, A Merry-Go-Round
If Mary make it to my room, then Mary-Go-Down
Hold up. slow down, I bet'cha know now
Old-fashion show down with a new fashion 4-pound
Yeah, show some respect in this bitch
You getting stacks of money, I get stacks of checks in this bitch
Nigga, it's about to be a train wreck in this bitch
My niggas ready, that's why all of 'em sweating and shit
I got another group of niggas that'll make ya leave
Instead of putting on ya act, that's just make believe
Maybe it's all of this money, maybe the ice on my wrist
Maybe the Phantom outside, maybe it's Maybelline
See me?!
