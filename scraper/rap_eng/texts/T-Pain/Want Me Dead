[Intro: T-Pain]
Hey
Let's keep it going
Hey
Ladies and gentlemen
Boom!
Fizzle
Noreago
Let's make a move baby
Boom, boom

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, hey
They want me dead
For what I said
I'm not backing down
I'm bout to act a clown
Hey, hey, hey
They gonna be mad at me
Tell them come at me
I don't give a fuck
They want me gone
I'm coming home
Got some bitches and some niggas
(they put me on)
Hey, hey
I know they're gonna be hating
Use it as motivation
I don't give a fuck

[Verse 1: N.O.R.E.]
See most of these dudes they really want you dead
They smile at your face but really want you dead
They hangout with you they but really want you dead
They want you fail but you succeed instead!
They ask you how you doing, they don't care the answer
When they need a favour it's like a cure to cancer
Success is a real niggas medicine
That's why the world only respect rich Veterans
And I'v never been excited by Fashion Week
I've laugh at that trash, most of Fashion Week
And all I want to do is make my bro proud
Sneak through the airport with [?] loud

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, hey
They want me dead
For what I said
I'm not backing down
I'm bout to act a clown
Hey, hey, hey
They gonna be mad at me
Tell them come at me
I don't give a fuck
They want me gone
I'm coming home
Got some bitches and some niggas
(they put me on)
Hey, hey
I know they're gonna be hating
Use it as motivation
I don't give a fuck

[Verse 2: N.O.R.E.]
They gon' wish hate on you
And that's for no reason
Hope that you fail
And that's for no reason
They pray you in jail
And that's for no reason
Stay stronger than slime, homie
And keep breathing
Queens, New York, left, rack, body them
I'm used to running the blocks with no cardio
You want to be the best so they rank you
And me and Nas back good, so left thank you
Me and Lamar will be back good eventually
Queens niggas, realest of the century
They don't want you at Caviar and Tiffany
They want you broke in the hood
And full of misery

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, hey
They want me dead
For what I said
I'm not backing down
I'm bout to act a clown
Hey, hey, hey
They gonna be mad at me
Tell them come at me
I don't give a fuck
They want me gone
I'm coming home
Got some bitches and some niggas
(they put me on)
Hey, hey
I know they're gonna be hating
Use it as motivation
I don't give a fuck

[Verse 3: N.O.R.E.]
You see the homies over there
They just wanna bury you
They giving you drugs because they wanna bury you
They feeding you fast food
They wanna bury you
Stay strong my nigga
God will carry you
Gotta recognize the devil when he wearing white
He could probably buy souls but he ain't giving life
They wanted me dead
I still kept it nice
Gave out pies
I only kept a slice

[Hook: T-Pain]
Hey, hey
They want me dead
For what I said
I'm not backing down
I'm bout to act a clown
Hey, hey, hey
They gonna be mad at me
Tell them come at me
I don't give a fuck
They want me gone
I'm coming home
Got some bitches and some niggas
(they put me on)
Hey, hey
I know they're gonna be hating
Use it as motivation
I don't give a fuck
Hey, hey
They want me dead
For what I said
I'm not backing down
I'm bout to act a clown
Hey, hey, hey
They gonna be mad at me
Tell them come at me
I don't give a fuck
They want me gone
I'm coming home
Got some bitches and some niggas
(they put me on)
Hey, hey
I know they're gonna be hating
Use it as motivation
I don't give a fuck
