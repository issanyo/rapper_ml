[Hook: T-Pain] (x2)
Wait a minute
Shit might take a minute
All my niggas go work, let it cook let it bake a minute
Swimming in the money, my crib got a lake up in it
Indoor pool, outdoor pool, all my bitches getting naked in it

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
I'm rich bitch, spend a milli make a milli
I need it all to come back I know I can't take it with me
But I don't give a fuck about that, if anybody trying to make it with me
Meet me in the mahfucking bus out back I got hoes and they shaking in it
Chopping on 'em put it in the bag first then make money
Chevrolet squatting on them put that bitch in reverse clean that for me]
Who that call the coppers on me I'm the boss I ain't done shit and my hands clean
The chopper get whopping on them, shit'll wake the neighborhood up like caffeine

[Hook](x2)

[Verse 2: OG Maco]
Wait a minute, let a youngin get a 60 seconds
Still with my niggas and we flexing
Snakes on my shoes like westerns
Sheesh, sheesh
Its like [?] with my every step
Payback but he never left
[?] you could use my help
[?] we still autotune it
Its the resurrection if it wasn't there
Dead presidents poking out the denim
They pissed me off now I'm shitting on them like they were toilets we've been working [?]
