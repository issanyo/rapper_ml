Go stupid, retarded but don't go sick
Ho put me on the couch like it's 106
Now it's hard to breathe
If I fuck her on the floor I can call it shag carpeting (get it?)
And she's a freaky thing
If I ever wrote song about her it'll be hard to sing
She got my tongue tied I’ma give her the noose
Triple shot of Patrón got a bitch gettin’ loose
I’m the Snoop in her Dogg I’m the gin in her juice
She got money on her mind and she gimme the loot (brain)
Get the dick up, it’s a stick up
Put the tongue to it and now she can't even get up
It’s a bird it's a plane (What's his name?)
I’m-I’m-I’m

[Chorus]

Bust it open, bust it open
