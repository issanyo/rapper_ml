[Verse 1: That Girl Lay Lay]
This song's gonna get stuck inside you
Run but you can't hide, I'll find you
Shine so bright, my bling bling blind you
Sing this song, I must remind you
Everybody roll out, screamin' and a shout
Everybody in the house got it comin' from they mouth
Runnin', runnin', let me get 'em
Y'all have the rhythm stuck in your system?
I'm goin' to the top, everybody goin' to the top
Everybody head goin' to rock, everybody said, "Don't stop," everybody said, "Don't stop," ooh

[Verse 2: That Girl Lay Lay]
There's nothin' that you can't do
There's nothin' that you can say
This song is stuck on replay
You better sing it every single day
From the mornin', the noon, the night
I got it movin' from left to right
And if you wonder who's to blame
Yeah, it's me stuck in they brain
Like a permanent stain and it won't change
Even if you go insane, this song now in your brain
And in your brain it will remain

[Bridge: That Girl Lay Lay]
This song is now stuck inside yo'
This song is now stuck inside yo'
This song is now stuck inside yo' head
This song is now stuck inside yo'
This song is now stuck inside yo'
This song is now stuck inside yo' head

[Chorus: T-Pain]
'Cause it's so catchy, catchy
It's such a catchy song
Gonna make you happy, happy
I'm tryna fight and sing along
