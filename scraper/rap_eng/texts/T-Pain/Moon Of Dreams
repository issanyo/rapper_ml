The night time, the moon light
And here am I again
Living through every moment
Of how we used to be, yeah, yeah
The night time, the moon light
Is breaking through my pain
Leaving me where I'm happy
And keeping me in a dream
Like a wounded bird in the lonely sky
I just can't forget that I used to fly
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Like a frozen tear on a shaking lip
Left alone with fear and it hurts so deep
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Uh, wings, dreams
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
The sunrise, a new day
I'm waking up again
All alone with my memories
I keep thinking about you
The sunrise, a new day
It's nothing else but pain
I will wait for the sunset
To talk to you, in my dreams
Like a wounded bird in the lonely sky
I just can't forget that I used to fly
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Like a frozen tear on a shaking lip
Left alone with fear and it hurts so deep
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Daytime, the sunlight, I will never love again
We try to work it out, so many different ways but
We can never be friends
When the sun goes down and I think about you
How we used to be, then it rises again
And I loose a friend, and here I am again
Waiting on the moon of dreams
Take, take me back, take, take me back
Bring, bring me back, bring, bring me back
Like a wounded bird in the lonely sky
I just can't forget that I used to fly
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Like a frozen tear on a shaking lip
Left alone with fear and it hurts so deep
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
