[Intro x3]
Shawty, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
It's like a sin on top of a sin what I'd do to you
Over again and over again, you ain't gotta move
And when you look into my eyes, I got to go harder
And when you climb on top of me, I hit rock bottom
She can't leave me alone, rock bottom (x4)

[Verse 1]
She got me thinking 'bout what I got
She hop in the Lincoln. we hit my spot
I got her drinkin', she gettin' hot
She want me on bottom, bottom, bottom
She saw my pinky, that big ol' rock
That bitch is bling-blingin', non-stop
And now she gettin' kinky, she want the top
That means I'm on bottom, bottom, bottom
She be goin' down and she come back up
Girl stop messin' with me!
Take your clothes off, baby take a load off
I'ma tell you what's it's gon' be!
All kinds of touchin' and rubbin', some of the lovin' that you never had
So let me get a rubber out this Gucci bag
We gon' do somethin' that make your daddy mad
Now, baby put your hands up and say YEAH!

[Verse 2]
We hit the city, we in my drop
The DJ wicky-wicky, she gettin' hot
She dancin' by the speaker, that booty pop
She feelin' that bottom, bottom, bottom

Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
She got me thinkin', I'm in love
In love with that bottom, bottom, bottom!
Left cheek, right cheek, make that booty work
