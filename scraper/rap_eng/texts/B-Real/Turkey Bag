[Intro: Styles P & Berner]
This feels great
Yeah

[Verse 1: Styles P]
You start as lil' bro, then you big bro
You start as lil' homie, then you big homie
Niggas know me
The bitches know me
Salute to the Goonies,do a stick up for me
When I die blow some weed, pour some liquor for me
Know I keep working the whip, you couldn't get up on it
I've been skrting' off since Nextels was chirping off
Looking at the stash house could tell you what the dirt is for
I could get deeper with it, tell you what niggas murder for
All this fly shit that we living for
Superstitious hand is itching, I'm bout to get it though
Can't trust niggas, the UZI is by the kitchen door
Be careful what you be wishing for
Well to the well is empty, what is [?] for?
Can't get nothing from nothing, I prove different though
But never say you gettin' the money, 'cause they be snitchin' y'all

[Hook: Berner & Styles P]
Hand fulls out the turkey bag
Move the pounds, blow the funds, you lookin' at the chosen ones
Hand fulls out the turkey bag
Never rat, love the silence, you lookin' at the golden ones
Hand fulls out the turkey bag, I'm loaded
I'ma throw em 20 pounds, let em work with that
Hand fulls out the turkey bag
Long live the king, be a king, word to the Jack

[Verse 2: Berner]
This shit is dreamy
Got me readin' 'bout nefertiti
Bora Bora for a week
When I leave Tahiti
Pimpin' ain't' easy but the game still need me
Only reason I'm around still
I never got greedy
The trippy thing about life
Is you could live forever
Keep your name good
In the streets
I'm tryna' do better
Paper drips was sauce
Yeah, I burn nice and slow
Another million from the road
I'm tryna buy another home
I miss the Jack, big 40 on my lap, while I'm ridin'
While the good keep dyin'
Half a pound to the neck
I'ma grind 'til I see the sunrise
We don't rest
We don't even flex, nah
We just feel blessed to wake up in the mornin' and
Take another breath (Think about it)
Hand fulls out the turkey bag, I'm loaded
I'ma throw em 20 pounds, let em work with that

[Hook: Styles P & Berner]
Hand fulls out the turkey bag
Move the pounds, blow the funds, you lookin' at the chosen ones
Hand fulls out the turkey bag
Never rat, love the silence, you lookin' at the golden ones
Hand fulls out the turkey bag, I'm loaded
I'ma throw em 20 pounds, let em work with that
Hand fulls out the turkey bag
Long live the king, be a king, word to the Jack
