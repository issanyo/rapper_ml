[Hook: Berner]
Uh, I do it for the mob
A hundred-forty large for my car, oh my god
Funky feels with the raw
Brought a pound lets burn it all
I'm always on my job
Yeah, I do it for the mob
Yeah, I'm always on my job
I do it for my squad
I do it for the stones on my wrist without a flaw
High speed with the laws
I brought a pound lets burn it all
I'm always on my job
Yeah, I do it for the mob

[Verse 1: B-Real & Berner]
[Berner]
This shit is super tasty
I'm super rich I'm lazy
I got a cribanazy
I filled it up with babies
I bought a new Mercedes
Escorts work and pay me
Gold chains like a dope boy in the 80's
[B-Real]
Five-fifty doin' 80
On the 101 on the daily
God damn, this life so crazy
Shot in the world, comment Hailee
Go ahead sip your bailey's, this flower just goi'n fail me
I got that lemon tree, bossed out, Kevin Spacey
[Berner]
Good weed, pretty girls, coke white, candy pearl
Leather in my space ship, tell me I can have the world
[B-Real]
Raw papers with the swirl
Glass tip Mr. Earl
Funky feels and my papers, Bern might grab your girl

[Hook: Berner]
Uh, I do it for the mob
A hundred-forty large for my car, oh my god
Funky feels with the raw
Brought a pound lets burn it all
I'm always on my job
Yeah, I do it for the mob
Yeah, I'm always on my job
I do it for my squad
I do it for the stones on my wrist without a flaw
High speed with the laws

[Verse 2: B-Real & Berner]
[B-Real]
She's rollin' with the Doctor like Bonny and Clyde
Just rid'n every ride
You want to see these packs, hold down lookin' at a smile
I don't know why
She can't resist, she's got the burning feeling inside
She want to twist on me, want to hit some
We got to get some fire by
[Berner]
Big Bern stay ready if it go down
Whole body just covered in gold now
Buy a whole pound, in the streets, back seat, Uh
Chillin' in a smoke cloud
Yeah, and that money keep comin' in
Roll with my day ones, smoke till my day come
Dope like A1, roll up, blaze some
[B-Real]
Y'all can't fuck with us
Untouch you way to close you toast
We high we high as fuck, brain cells fuck'n toast
[Berner]
Light cream envelope, light weed smell like soap
Hold it in till you choke, top shelf, cut your throat

[Hook: Berner]
Uh, I do it for the mob
A hundred-forty large for my car, oh my god
Funky feels with the raw
Brought a pound lets burn it all
I'm always on my job

[Verse 3: B-Legit]
Bitch I got a problem
Always I be mobbin'
Ain't no way to stop him
He got guns, he goin pop â€˜em
Then I'm goin' shopping for that new Rolls Royce
I'm around and you ain't really got no choice
Shit moist, out of su su, my uncle garage
Get a nick for every pic, you got a good trim job
See I mob, but I'm breathing
DABS got me leaning
Allergies, I'm sneezing gets some ounces to reason
Money on the floor, dirt up in my raw
Blonde little hippy, biggest rig I ever saw
And we respect the law, cards up our wallets
Number on the bottom, that's my lawyer, you can call it
Fuck alcoholic, OD on some trees
I put up twenty lights, make some shatter out them leaves Xanies over ease, that shit from overseas
Mobbin' from in the West, she like that California breeze

[Hook: Berner]
Uh, I do it for the mob
A hundred-forty large for my car, oh my god
Funky feels with the raw
Brought a pound lets burn it all
I'm always on my job
Yeah, I do it for the mob

I do it for my squad
I do it for the stones on my wrist without a flaw
High speed with the laws
