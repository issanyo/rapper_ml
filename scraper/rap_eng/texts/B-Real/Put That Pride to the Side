[Verse 1:]
This shit so crazy when you love a lady but she playin games
Got you feelin like what if you kill her would it be the same?
Every thing these bitches do it always seems strange
Down bad without no money they’ll leave you in the rain
Now you wonderin: what’s up with her, like what a nigga did?
She just guilt me (?) so she can go and suck another nigga’s dick
Hoe I thought you were for me but you another nigga’s bitch
I caught the play and moved around, now you back jumpin’ on my dick
I don’t want you; he can keep you
Gotta watch em, they be sneaky
On the low they be freaky but carry too many secrets
Was supposed to hold me down until I get to the top
You went and got another nigga and put my number on block
Block you back, now you hot
Look how the tables turned on you
That nigga that you left me for, he put that burn on you
I ain’t trippin, I just hope one day you get it together
I got a lot, now you missed out, we were ‘posed to get it together

[Verse 2:]
Next story’s bout this nigga I used to love like a brother
That’s how I used to look at him, we come from the same struggle
But money will change a nigga, and fame just made it worse
Gotta stay one up on a nigga, can’t picture me in no hearse
But picture when I was broke on my knuckles he used to love me
I started rappin’, made it happen, and now he feeling like fuck me
What the fuck?! Man this can’t be real
Now I’m hearin’ through the wind you wan’ get me killed
And this before the deal Shit really real
Don’t ever underestimate a nigga, he really will
And all this shit strange to me, how homie changed on me
We had some words and now he tryna bring that pain to me
So I just stay to myself, your closest partner will trip
Some petty shit could end up to your homeboy flippin’ the script
I ain’t beefin’ with dude, shit, I just wish him the best
But if he come in my lane, I gotta put him to rest
