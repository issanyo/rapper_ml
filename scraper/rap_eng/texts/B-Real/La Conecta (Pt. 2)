[Intro]
"Don't come back asshole! We're gonna miss you!"
"Fuck you, motherfucker, I ain't never comin' back to this place."
"Ey, holmes, it's good to see you, holmes
I haven't seen you in a long time, hahaha."
You're looking good, man!"
"Thanks, holmes."
"Did you get that information I asked you for?"
"Yeah, yeah, sure, sure, I got everything, holmes
7:30 tonight."
"Joaquin, what time is it?"

[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
It's seven and a half sharp, this things about to start
My whole crew's being torn apart
By a spark of the greed cause everybody needs
And if you're in the way, they spray, you bleed
The bad breed, punks like Sonny with dreams of running
The whole show trippin' off, controllin' money

[Verse 2: B-Real]
It's close to the time all my soldiers are in line
It's my motherfuckin' time to shine
All my soldiers are outside, waitin' for my sign
Big roller, hostile take over
I won't hesitate to blow his fuckin' old ass and be mero mero
You can't teach an old perro new tricks
So when I give you the signal, take 'em out quick

[Verse 3: Sick Jacken]
There's a knock on the door, it must be Sonny
Watch him and his clique empty their clip if they trip
Yo, Sonny, come inside, I'm glad you arrived
Have a seat and the boss will be right with you in five

[Verse 4: B-Real]
What? fuck that shit, I ain't got time for this
I got business to take care of with Jesus, bitch
Get him out here in a hurry
And get the fuck out my face before you get buried

[Verse 5: Big Duke]
I kicked down the door he thought he was dead
Lead staring at his head, this is what he said
"Gustavo, it's nice to see you, huh?"
I said, "Why the fuck did I get sacrificed?"
You sold my soul to the devil
Now I'm livin' life at a strange level
I come back for the big payback
You don't wanna catch the bullet back, stand back
Bring your arms around slow from the front to the back
Don't try to move quick, don't try to move too fast
Revenge already calls for the gun to go blast
You don't wanna die for this pig ally
I plan for 15 years to kill this man

[Verse 6: Sick Jacken]
And I'll have to be the one to fuck up your plans
It's on; they set it off, my crew bare arms
Everybody in the scope gets smoked
Tryin' to fuck with the Don

[Verse 7: B-Real]
Fuck it, I'm going for broke, let the gun smoke
Fill the room, put Jesus in his fuckin' tomb
I'm going for mine and he's going for his
I'll piss on your grave and kill all your kids
Fuck all of you!
