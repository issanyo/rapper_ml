Got every type of wide that you might desire
Go ahead and dig it up, maybe you a dead inspire

Some like the sound and beat, until this west cost paper
On the West coast cuz we all know the kuch is cool

No stress, no bush, I'mma cush in the bush
When the harvards put the key on the back

Taking hits from the bong wiht the ight betwen
Take hits and get songs and I got all done
