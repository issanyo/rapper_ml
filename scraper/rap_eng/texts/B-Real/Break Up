Girl I know
You tired of the rumors and lies but I tried
You say you gone but I just can't say goodbye
Is there a way that I can make it up to you to you [x2]

[Verse 1:]
I know you tired
You want to move on
Every king need a queen
And you the hier to the throne
I hear alot of rumors
And rumors are lies
They want to b in your position
Girl just open your eyes
Yea I don't understand
How you could put a rumor
Before your boyfriend
But I just chill and be cool
I dealt with this cause I onlywant to be with you
See people lie and everything
But since you gone feel
Like I'm in dat Hurricane
Wat can I do to make it up to you
And theirs no limits to the things I'll do

It's maybe my emotions that got me steady tryin
You and me equals a life on the beach
Don't worry bout your haters baby

I just don't know wat to do
D ony time I'm on point
Is when I'm with you
Don't let me slip

Just tell what to do to get that back
Girl hypnotize on a another world
Don't mean nothin else as long as I got my baby girl
Rumors are lies
Yea they are fake
But you are my girlfriend
