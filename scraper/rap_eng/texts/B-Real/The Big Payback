[Intro: B-Real]
Ey, bring that shit!
Once again the psycho ward would like to bring something new
So we present The Big Payback

[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
Do you even know the reason for your blastin'? It's pointless
You grab your stainless, do your action and he stays motionless
Because of your error, they label this era of terror
Drop the coke, the mirror, keep your nose clearer
The outcome of what you've done shook slums of rivals
From other sides with guns, soldier, and knives
You took one of their lives and finished it
Now they decide they want to retaliate
Find your ass in even shit
In memory of lost souls, in honor of their homeboys
Dying here in South Los
Now don't even decide you want to hide
If they don't find who they're looking for, they shoot whoever's inside
Your little street family
They drive by your block and shoot randomly
You think that it's best to test
Lead 'em on a quest not cease
And in the end let one of your homeboys rest in peace

[Hook: Big Duke]
I'm looking for you, I'm gonna get you back
When I catch you on the street slippin'
And that ass is mine
Crazily all up in my face with your set trippin'
And that ass is mine
Ah shit, murder clique jumping from behind the fence
And that ass is mine
The Big Payback I'm gonna get you muthafucka
And that ass is mine

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
I'm living in southside, avoiding my death
With cautious steps
I might end up serving a point for someone's rep
That's why a gun is kept, I will employ it's services
If I need to stop their plot from being murderous
Can't be a victim of fool who stick 'em
They walk through life with wicked smiles and piles of loot
Don't hesitate to shoot in the quest for dead presidents
They're getting rich at the expense of dead residents
A lot of rascals causing deep fiascoes
If you come across 'em avoid 'em; their mentality is
Blast those who ain't down with me
They got something I want and I'll take it
If they resist, it's permanent sleep
Don't try to be brave; you'll end up in the grave
It's quite impossible to reform those who misbehave
Crooks who took will continue to take
Leave you shook with no question and then break
No scene seems to break his trance of nice dreams
For visine, disguises the red so his eyes gleam
Another situation will arise
Until the instigator takes his turn to die
In South Side

[Hook: Big Duke]
