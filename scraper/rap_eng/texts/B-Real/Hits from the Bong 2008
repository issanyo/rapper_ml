[Intro: B-Real]
(Boogie)
Alchemist: takin’ hits from the booong
Evidence: takin’ hits from the booong

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Pick it, pack it, grind it up, load a bong
And take a {inhale} ‘til it’s gone
Put the Dutch down, just for a second
Don't get me wrong it's not a new method
Inhale… exhale
I’ll send you some Kush in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double-barreled bong is strictly glass blown
So filling, there's water inside - don't spill it
It smells like {ugghh} on the carpet, still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of that candy, jellybean, smelly green shit
Weed so strong I sleep all day long
Do you want a hit from the bong?

[Hook: B-Real, (Evidence), [Alchemist?]]
Do you want a hit, do you want a hit
Do you wanna take a hit from the bong? (Pack another bowl up)
[You want another hit?]
Do you want a hit, do you want a hit, (No, I don’t like when you just take half a hit - I wanna get a clean one)
Do you wanna take a hit from the bong?
[Take another hit]
Do you want a hit, do you want a hit, (Yeah, green Evidence)
Do you wanna take a hit from the bong? (The real Kush)
[Do you want another hit?]
Do you want a hit, do you want a hit
Do you wanna take a hit from the bong?

[Verse 2: Evidence]
Let’s smoke this load, hit this bong
And then lift this bowl ‘til the weed is gone
Plug 1, plug 2 to the brain (Cypress)
You know I’m still insane
I keep going back in the end to see Mary
My old flame, her nickname was Cherry
And she was so good to me:
When I pack a new bowl, the bong is clean
Don’t get me stirred up, the smoke from the bubblin’ water
Is making it pure so I got to
Take that hit then hold it
Just like block, I’m on stock so I’m rollin’
Get my 6-footer and bring it on
On a chair taking hits from the bong

[Hook: B-Real, (Evidence), [Alchemist?]]
Do you want a hit, do you want a hit
Do you wanna take a hit from the bong? (The one we were smoking on earlier, who’s hitting that?)
[Do you want another hit?]
Do you want a hit, do you want a hit
Do you wanna take a hit from the bong? (Oh my God)
[Take another hit]
Do you want a hit, do you want a hit
Do you wanna take a hit from the bong?
[You want another hit?]
Do you want a hit, do you want a hit
Do you wanna take a hit from the bong?
[You gotta take another hit]
