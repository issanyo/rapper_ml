Stoney, stoney, yeah you know me
Back all by my lonely (back all by my lonely)
Bag full of fire for the real ones only (real ones only)
Phoney homies quick to turn they backs on me (turn they backs on me)
Just like my Woods, let ‘em all burn out slowly (all burn out slowly)

Stoney, stoney, yeah you know me
Back all by my lonely (back all by my lonely)
Bag full of fire for the real ones only (real ones only)
Phoney homies quick to to turn they backs on me (turn they backs on me)
Just like my Woods, let ‘em all burn out slowly (all burn out slowly)

[Verse 1] Demrick
Back to the tire shop, the wheels need work
When I come around them curbs, girl don’t hit me with this work
When shit get on my nerves I just crumble up some herb
Man, got two things in this world
Just this boss and this work, huh?
.. And I ain’t jeopardizing either one (no way!)
Hustle all day, never see the sun (never see the sun.)
Grind all night ‘til the morning come. (Let’s get it)
Everybody eating, yeah, I need me some
I need me some, you see I be the one, kill any beat I’m on
This tree I breathe, you’ll probably need a lung before you Cheech & Chong
Chose to sing along at an eat-along
Tell her leave her thong
That shit we be on until I’m dead and gone. (dead and gone.)

[Verse 2] Zombie Juice
Burn it up
[?] my blunt and she fell in love
I got the life for the minimum
Money we count by the [?]

[Verse 3] B-Real
Loud, I roll it up
Blowing that cloud, you fold it up
My bro can’t hold it up
That bomb OG, I blow it up
Seeds, I sow 'em up
Can't wait 'til I grow 'em up
That lean the pour it up
But it's the insane that tore 'em up, uh
They take that hit, quit it
Show these hoes how we get it, get it
Pay a bitch quick, spit it
ATM in the lobby, hit it
Admit it, it's that shit that got you lit
We burn it down
Turns up many pounds
Nah bitch, ain't no slowing down
On that creek, shit is deep, you ain't loud
Can't hear a peep, you that sheep, follow me into a cloud
Burning slow in my paint, out of reach
We elevate beyond your station
Hear him preach!
