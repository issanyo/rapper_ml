[Verse 1: Berner]
Tell that bitch to leave, I don't really care
Diamonds on my wrist strip, 4 carats in my ear
I'm feeling like a king and I don't even have to steer
This car drive itself, 30 mil in one year (2015)
My fam died, not a tear drop
Police right behind me and, I'm not gonna stop (high speed)
Shit, we get money outta bops and I
Flip weed do a bump off the block, uh
Little momma got ass
Dance slow while she wanna talk cash
Hardcore hash, live fast 'til I pass
Will they cry when I'm gone
A few haters gonna laugh, shit
Smoke tough, I can never quit
Rollie on my wrist, I can never get enough of this (fast life)
Pullin' on her hair, I make her scream loud
X5, today I brought the Beamer out

[Hook: B-Real]
Breathe in, breathe out
Put it in the air, hell yeah
This is one for the stoners (for the ones who get high)
Live the high life
Get your mind right
This is one for the stoners (for the ones who get high)
Live the high life
Get your mind right

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Turn it up, let the smoke settle
Blurred lines everywhere, gas pedal
We'll spin see the tints in the distance
Smell the flower that we burned, for instance
Him and me smoking lemon tree
Rolling cherry pie in the glasstip shatter in the sky
Yeah we elevated, pay no mind hater
Roll it up, Phunky Feels with the shine paper
We keep you medicated, you at the table faded
So much green I'm jaded, I know you fuckin' hate it
See the birds flock to the nest
Green thumb, top shelf, yeah we out west
Shout out to the sherpinator, for the [?] that are higher than an elevator
Damn, so much fuckin' flavor
Jet lights, jet fuel, dab too

[Hook: B-Real]

[Verse 3: Sage the Gemini]
I feel like the man when I roll through
Used to write checks, I'm like man I hope they go through
Now I ride foreign, you ain't fresh and I don't know you
Everything new cuz I was poor back in the old school
I'm feelin' like I'm supposed to
House on the hill
I attract a lot of ducks, all they get is to pay my bills
I be ridin' in the hood, I don't hide out
Pretty boy on the screen but let a nigga find out
Made my first mil at 21, high school I was a bum
Now fuck it it is done, I don't care if they come
You got money, give me some, yeah get with this pimpin
I drive benzes and best, all I'm missin' is limpin'
I'm on a mission
I used to tell a nigga grow up
Now they be like "what the fuck is that" when I roll up
Now I get a hundred fifty racks when I show up
Yeah, nigga, all I gotta do is show up, uh
