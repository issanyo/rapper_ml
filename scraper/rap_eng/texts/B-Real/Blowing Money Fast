[Intro]
Do you want to get high?
Does everybody want to get high?
I want to get high!

[Hook]
Blunts, dabs, joints, slabs
Vape, clouds, loud, gas, puff, pass
Grow, stash, quarters, halfs, pounds, bags
Blowing money fast, I be blowing money fast
I be blowing money fast, I be blowing money fast

[Verse 1: Demrick]
Got a zip, it’s the gas take a trip
Put the flame to the glass, take a dab feel the hit
I’ma stack it to the ceiling til there’s millions in the stash
Went from nick bags on the Ave., now I'm out in Amsterdam
Add it up like mathematicians, all my bad decisions verse my ambition
This is repetition, you can see the difference
I rep it for the have nots, Strippers with them mad shots
Pimps push a product out that Pontiac Ragtop
Spend it like I print it like that shit just been invented
This the gold rush, I'm something like the gold crush with it
On that marijuana marathon, Me more than a carry on
Jet fuel very strong, Ha I last very long

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Scoop Deville]
Time piece all around the world
See me with your girl, On her knees, got 12
Hundred freaks in the penthouse, watch me give a fuck
Next day we hop off the tour bus, hit the gas
Burn a half into ashes, boss
Hoes that flip like gymnastics, applause
Don't worry bout how I get mine, get yours
By the time I hit the stage it's jam backed to the doors
[?], I'm a grown man, gold chain, light it up like Las Vegas
MGM, shout out to my partners lock down in the pen
I'ma do this one for y'all, they just wanna see me win
9 times out of 10, Smoke down in the big body benz
With your girlfriend, creme dela creme
Juice, gin, life is too short
Getting ends, Make sure you get yours, cause this man got his

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Real]
I be blowing money, honey dripping
Blowing trees, you be blowing reggie
You be willing knowing me, we hit the gas
Doctors orders when we rolling
Now your pockets getting thinner
But you came in with them swollen (What you holding)
Dabs up, blunts down, I put a slab on it
Doesn't matter nails hot put a dab on it
Grams melting by the second for the hell of it
You thirsty ass bitches magnetize for the smell of it
Flipping rigs like it's nothing big, no spill
Let the rig hit the ground, glass breaks big deal
Triple flipper in the sky, why you asking why
Scoop called the doctor and he said (I want to get high!)
Milky hits, water bubble, lungs blow up
I'm the duke of errl, baby pouring shatter like it's syrup
Wrap her, then a white girl, lights swirl, glass tip
Pussy's can't hang, lights out, catnip

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Berner]
Sandro Pay, creme brulee and mimosa's
Yellow hash, wax hits, ash tray 20 roaches
Thousand dollar glass, yeah i'm first class toasting, to the good life
In my S-Class Benz floating, ask Demrick how I get down
I grew up by the ocean, where the pounds go for cheap
And them local girls are hoeing, they asked me where i'm going
To the top with this bass shit, new strain alert
Here you go taste it, you know we get the paper
Jars with the different flavors, wiz khalifa papers
Hardcore, trippy vapors, you got a bitch to pay ya
All my girls are money makers, I'm in Jamaica
Drug money on my kitchen table, blowing

[Hook]

(I want to get high!)
