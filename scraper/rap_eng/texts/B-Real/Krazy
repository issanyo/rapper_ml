[Intro: KOG Devo]
They say what don't kill you makes you stronger
And sometimes ya past haunts ya
Don't let it kill you in the process
I tell them know that Devo got this

[Verse 1: KOG Devo]
Cameras flashing
Bitches asking where you been at
Devin spazzing
I'm getting checks because I'm rapping baby don't you panic
Just tell that bitch that he gone see his daddy
I'm wishing for that foreign car I'll settle for that caddy
My nigga push that ice
So many niggas lost they life I had to sacrifice
They told me get it right
While mama gone I hit the corner every day and night
So I can get me some money to get my girl some ice
Oh now she splashing on me
I love my baby and my money so I'm never lonely
And R.I.P to my twins you know I keep them on me
You know it hurt daddy heart I got that call from Tony
He told me keep yo head
Dev I know you fed up
But just do it for yo daughters
So nigga I been harder than I ever been
No I ain't showing no sympathy
Know I gotta win
Funny how niggas be changing when Devo start a trend
You know I'm cold with the styling but better with the pen
Niggas jacked me for my change I'm talking many men
But now I got a .40 on me and some Benjamins
I'm never lacking pray to god I don't commit a sin
And I say if I go to hell I'm screaming fuck it then

[Verse 2: KOG Devo]
2 Chains on my neck like I'm Tity Boi
Old hoes I went to school with saying get it boy
Don't let this choppa hit ya head it just might split it boy
And if yo hoe up on my line I might just hit it boy
Trapoholic so retarded don't know what to call it
See I got caught up in the house my nigga fuck a closet
You gotta problem
I gotta feeling I gotta spark it
Load it then cock it point at ya brain got stains on the carpet
Then grab ya women dick in her stomach wet like a faucet
She yellin "slay me in front the baby" (Devo stop talkin)
Man fuck that nigga I fucked his lady and sent her walkin
Then seen her nigga mean muggin boy you really stalkin
Clean up ya act and maybe bitches wouldn't cheat on you
I used to struggle gettin one but now I'm keepin two
You think I'm lyin ask my bitches they gone speak the truth
I call my homie Lil Tony see what he gone do
Tony Montana be loading that hammer and blasting the blammer
Shooting on stage don't give a fuck bout a camera
We so unorganized Lil nigga what the fuck is a planner
My ex be hittin up my phone that Lil bitch know I can't stand her
She so annoying but I guess she doesn't know why I canned her
Bitch from East Atlanta
Pour a four in the Fanta
Buy a pint if you got gualla give a fuck bout a minor
Fuck ya Ma and ya Nana
Smoking sweet Tropicana
Light the spliffy up and chief it might just fuck up my grammar
Ayy
