I be that short temper high style rhyme bringer
Life style got wild similar to rock singer

Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dream
Cypress, Assassin, SX, Latin Thug thing

Fools need to get back, I ain't really with that
Flavor of the month programmers try to dispatch

Always got the good batch, take it to the head
Got you wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead

Don't trip get a grip be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down and stripped butt naked

I just kicked the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time that you hear it

Welcome to the show all come inside
So you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say ____ the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less
Welcome to the show all come inside
So you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say ____ the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less

When you chill with the Hill, keep your mouth sealed
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steal
If you have no ideal or any thoughts to bill
What you sought was real to give 'em slots to fill

Busters stop and yield but I'll daze them

Quicker than takin' a box of pills, now you gots to chill
Get cops and shields steady hawk the fields
And they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the will don't you mock the drill
'Cause I'll cock my steal and make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you top the deal
Quit talkin' nil you won't top my will bitch

Welcome to the show all come inside
So you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say ____ the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less
Welcome to the show all come inside
So you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say ____ the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less

Ain't nobody better, on that you can bet
Wanna see a dog show put your money on my set

Real MCs and real DJs, real southsiders from the heart of L.A

Now back in the days we had big success
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less

You can't beat the LP from the new Latin Lingo
Nowadays you nothin' without a hit single

Time to get locin', put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage and start up a commotion
No I ain't jokin', see my mic smokin'
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken, broken, broken, broken, broken, broken

Yeah, Cypress Hill, Amplified remix. Fredwreck drop that sh__

Welcome to the show all come inside
So you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say ____ the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less
Welcome to the show all come inside
So you can hear brought my style when it's amplified
You wanna party with the best say ____ the rest
'Cause we take away your stress and never settle for less
