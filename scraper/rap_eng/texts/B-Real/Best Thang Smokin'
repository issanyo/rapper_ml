[Intro]
Bigg Snoop Dogg, Berner, Wiz
Family first

Yeah, me and Wizzle man

[Verse 1: Berner]
This the best thang smokin'
Puertorican girls in my bed, bust that thang open
Growhouse full of KK in Oakland
Bags full of cash, got my safe overflowin'
I've been stayed loaded, I used to trim
Now we give each other pounds just to burn with our friends
See, this shit in my bag, ain't something you can buy
Before 911, I would make the pack fly
Envelope was full of cash, will show up at my door
Is it strange that I don't miss that feelin' anymore (it is)
A hundred pack on my floor or more
All big faces in my drawer for sure
I pulled off the lot with something nice to ride in
Everybody know who the one with the best supply is
Me and Wiz stay holded
We ridin' through the city just smokin'
This bag so crazy

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I know this might seem strange
But if you smoke, we choking
High with ya, less you roll up them planes
See I've been wa-tchin' you for a while
And I just gotta let you know that
We got the best thang smokin'
(best thang smokin, yea)

[Verse2: Snoop Dogg]
Ay, you know I got it
Keep it, sweep it, peep it, light it, lit it
All things cannabis, Doggy D-O-Doubled and did it
Forever committed, they will never admit it
But I don't trip off of that, I just get right back up in it
And put my feet on the yellow brick road and walk it out
And keep my head to the sky blowin' smoke out my mouth
O's in flows, circles with the power plant
Rollin' blunts, sittin' down, leavin' buds on my pants
And every chance I get to blow some KK
With my cousin Ray J
These niggas actin gay-gay
Ay ay, so I told my home boy maylay(?)
Let me use your AK, cause they say
I been havin' money since Dre Day
So what, know what
Also been buyin' more trees than the law allow
Bang bang! Shut it down, roll up another pound
It may look strange, but it feels awfully good to me

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I know this might seem strange
But if you smoke, we choking
High with ya, less you roll up them planes
See I've been wa-tchin' you for a while
And I just gotta let you know that
We got the best thang smokin'
(best thang smokin, yea)

[Verse 3: B-Real]
I stay so lifted, my crew is so gifted
No one could reach our levels once the Fuel is twisted
Once the Cookies burnin', turns into a function
Trichomes, gleamin, beamin like it ain't nothin'
You salty bitches steamin', green with envy
Yes my green is plenty, I won't give you any (ha)
And now you gotta have it
They want the flower or the concentrate gotta dab it
Haters curse me but they're thirsty for the big endorsements
You dirty bitches couldn't hurt me, why fuckin' force it
We ain't going nowhere, we deeply rooted
Cali kings raising Cali queens, keep it movin'
Ninety days and ninety nights, so many lights
So many heights to reach, many delights
That be whole tight, goin' in 'bought the whole night
Got the best shit lit and it's so right

[Hook: Wiz Khalifa]
Now I know this might seem strange
But if you smoke, we choking
High with ya, less you roll up them planes
See I've been wa-tchin' you for a while
And I just gotta let you know that
We got the best thang smokin'
(best thang smokin, yea)
