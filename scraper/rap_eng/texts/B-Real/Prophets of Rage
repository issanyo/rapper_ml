[Intro]
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
With vice I hold the mic device
With force I keep it away of course
And I'm keeping (keeping)
You from sleeping (sleeping)
And on stage I rage
And I'm rolling (rolling)
To the poor I pour in on with metaphors
I ain't bluffin', it's nothin'
That we ain't did before
We played you stayed
The points made
You consider it done
By the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like

[Chorus: Chuck D & B-Real]
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage

[Verse 2: B-Real]
With choice, became the people's voice
Shout loud for the ears up in the crowd
Raise your fist up (fist up)
While I lift up (lift up)
Fucking everything wrong with the system (system)
People hungry and dyin'
They ain't got a home
This is the nature created
From the terrordome (terrordome)
Let's turn the page
Time to burn the sage
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like

[Chorus: Chuck D & B-Real]
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
I roll with the punches so I survive
Try to rock cause it keeps the crowd alive
I'm not ballin' (ballin')
I'm just callin' (callin')
But I'm past the days of yes y'allin' (y'allin')
Wa wiggle round and round
I pump, you jump up
Hear my words my verbs
And get juiced up
I been around a while
You can describe my sound
Get down for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like

[Chorus: Chuck D & B-Real]
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
Can you kick it like this

[Outro: Chuck D & B-Real]
Clear the way
Clear the way
Clear the way
For the prophets of rage
The prophets of rage
The prophets of rage
The prophets of rage
The prophets of rage
The prophets of rage
The prophets of rage
Clear the way for the prophets of rage
(Power of the people say)
