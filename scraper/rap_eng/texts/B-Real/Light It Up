[B-Real]
I’m systematic, hydromatic
I’m unorthodox like Lenny Kravitz
I don’t play guitar and still on your radar
And you can help by screamin, “FUCK YOU HATERS!”
I’m so hungry I’ll take what’s on your plate
Look in your face like I’ma hit you with the milk crate
They say he one of the greatest, he’s a animal
My appetite is enormous like that of a cannibal
I eat emcees up, you might wanna ease up
I squeeze the trigger like I squeeze on a C cup
The beat is like crack now, you might wanna re up
Pete Rock, hit us with the heat rock, ease up!
I’m on the block straight, smokin up a Ozone
You in my shit, steady beggin for my homegrown
The beat is on, the heat is on
If Sen Dog’s Cheech, I must be Chong

[Chorus]
When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
Everybody everbody (i'mma light it up)
When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
Everybody everbody (i'mma light it up)

[Verse 2: Sen Dog]
I'm so amazing the joint's a blazin'
I can rip a mic on any occassion
Forfeit
Your stretched like a limousine for hatin
Hip hop so we took the nation by storm
A million fans stormed the the stages
The times are changes, my 9 is dangerous
My steel is stainless it will leave you brainless
Young and famous, we run LA
Its
Nobody take
Honey's are waitin'
Backstage at the show they wanna run with the crew
Half-ska but as cool as a fan
With theis moc in my hand Imma stay true to my friends
With this gun in my hand I stay true to the streets
If you say you are a dealer you have to proove it me

[Chorus]
When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
Everybody everbody (i'mma light it up)

[B-Real]
Beggin for a bong hit
Only what you beggin for

[Sen Dog]
Ashes to ashes
We put you in the dirt if you fuck with us

[B-Real]
Put it on youtube

[Sen Dog]
Operate with a screw loose
Last day out I give you a new suit

[Chorus]
When I got this mic (i'mma light it up)
When I step on stage (i'mma light it up)
Go ahead and pass the blunt (i'mma light it up)
Everybody everbody (i'mma light it up)
