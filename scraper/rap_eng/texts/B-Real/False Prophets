[Verse 1: B-Real]
I came here to help you
With your spirituality
In the path to find your soul to Me
I wanna set you free from negativity
And all the pain you received
Have faith, believe
In your Maker, your Master, Creator
God's Kingdom is at hand
From sea to the sand
In the desert with spirituality
Your origin begins
Follow me to the Heavens
Your spirit is capable of much more
Than whores and liquor
And drugs to kill you quicker
Than your Master (how it was) intended

[Verse 2: Big Duke]
[?] intended
Loved above all
But my envy of your kind was my downfall
By those weak in the mind
Destroy one by one, mankind
Am I emperor, leader?
Livin' in your city like Che
Viva!
Turn to rich residents
Crooked generals
Politicians, and country presidents
Everybody welcome to the presence
End of all innocence
And everything makes no sense

[Hook: B-Real]
Who are you, a devil or an angel
Just another stranger bringin' danger?
Temptation is the root of evil
What you conceal I reveal to all people
False prophets will burn to dust
In the fire, bringin' down your whole empire

[Verse 3: B-Real]
I gave you My Son in Moses
With the power to part the Red Sea
To flee from Egypt to be free
But many of you have turned your backs
Wanna stray
Worship idols in your blasphemous ways
You lost faith
Your lack in belief is your grief
Caused by the mischievous deceiver the beast
Tormenting your mind and soul
It's not too late
Before I have to have to turn My back
And close the gates of My Kingdom
And all the wicked burn
Hear the trumpets in Heaven
When My Son will return

[Verse 4: Big Duke]
I took your faith
Underworld Lord bring death's traits
Everyday lies and temptations bring bittersweet taste
Come in to live in my misery space
Lack of morale touched the soul of the whole human race
Memories of evil in the mind don't erase
You can't escape, all your actions are traced
Written down like stories attached to your face
Accounts of your long and winding road
Listen to the truths of the world and destinies i hold

[Hook]
Who are you, a devil or an angel
Just another stranger bringin' danger?
Temptation is the root of evil
What you conceal I reveal to all people
False prophets will burn to dust
In the fire, bringin' down your whole empire
