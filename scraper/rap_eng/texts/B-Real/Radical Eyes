[Verse 1: Chuck D]
If speed is what you need in this security mess
Your homeland history you want to dispossess
If you need anything else to make me bleed
That you wanna blame me for what I read
When I’m home down away from ducking your drones
Catching flows on this microphone
Saying I can't run, saying I can't hide
Seeing spies around the corner 'cause I'm Rage-ified

[Chorus: B-Real and Chuck D]
They didn’t hear my cries
They said, “Fuck my crisis”
Didn’t hear my cries
They said, “Fuck my crisis”
Didn’t hear my cries
They said, “Fuck my crisis”
Didn’t hear my cries
They said, “Fuck my crisis”
They say I'm radicalized
See my radical eyes
They say we're radicalized
See y'all radical eyes
They say I'm radicalized
See my radical eyes
They say we're radicalized
See y'all radical eyes
They say we’re seeing with this
They say we’re seeing with that
They say we’re seeing with this
They say we’re seeing with that
They say we’re seeing with this
They say we’re seeing with that
They say we’re seeing with this
They say we’re seeing with that

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Let’s get inside your head, why don’t you take these meds?
While I’m conveying my decaying more blood gets shed
You can witness on the daily, we ignore it instead
You can post it in the morning for the 'fusion of spreads
With the “Like” on the line, even though it’s brutal
Can’t resist, don’t even try, all attempts are futile
Now you’re part of the tricks, you’ve been distracted again
You fell asleep when you woke up for the fight for the win

[Chorus: B-Real and Chuck D]
They didn’t hear my cries
They said, “Fuck my crisis”
Didn’t hear my cries
They said, “Fuck my crisis”
Didn’t hear my cries
They said, “Fuck my crisis”
Didn’t hear my cries
They said, “Fuck my crisis”
They say I'm radicalized
See my radical eyes
They say we're radicalized
See y'all radical eyes
They say I'm radicalized
See my radical eyes
They say we're radicalized
See y'all radical eyes

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus: B-Real and Chuck D]
They say we’re seeing with this
They say we’re seeing with that
They say we’re seeing with this
They say we’re seeing with that
They say we’re seeing with this
They say we’re seeing with that
They say we’re seeing with this
They say we’re seeing with that
They say I'm radicalized
See my radical eyes
They say we're radicalized
See y'all radical eyes
They say I'm radicalized
See my radical eyes
They say we're radicalized
See y'all radical eyes
See my radical, radical, radical eyes
See my radical, radical, radical eyes
See my radical, radical, radical eyes
See my radical, radical, radical eyes
