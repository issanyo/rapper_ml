[Verse 1: Everlast]
I rip shit like a pro when I flow
And I score points with the joints that I throw
Cause I flow deadly, I'm no punk see
I break backs, make tracks and get funky
There's no one to run to cause nobody cares
MCs drop to your knees, say your prayers
The luck of the Irish is about to kick in
Prepare to die and notify your next of kin
I'm goin' all out, buck, duck and call out
That's how I'm livin', punk you better stall out
This is the House of Pain
To come inside is insane

[Hook]
I'll put your head out (4x)
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
I'll put your head out
Put put your head out
Jump up spread out
I'll put your head out
Hey what up punk?
I'll put your head out

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Who steps to booz
When the hoods wanna take a cruise
They're feelin' effects of the booze
Ain't no clues to hell with them fools
Who got smoked even though they strap tools
They got brews but I got the booma
Trigger to blast ya and skip the bull
Take my life shit, I'll take you to school
In a duel, what's the difference if you think you're droppin' jewels
Carbon copy think you're so cool
Stop dreamin' and hallucinatin'
You're caught up in a piece I'm paintin'
Click click, punk, now you think you know shit
Quit while you're ahead before I fill you full of lead

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Everlast]
Blessed with the gift, and gets with the rhyme
I never say quit when I'm out to get mine
It's live and let die, sit back and get high
Smokin' a fat blunt, waitin' for some punk
To act up like he's got somethin' in him
Then I grab the mic and start spittin' out venom
Carvin' up headstones, blowin' out headphones
Steppin' to me, you'll wind up in the Dead Zone
It's nothin' personal, that's how it goes, G
Step up with beef, and you'll wind up losin' teeth
Cause I don't give up the mic that easy
Step back, this ain't government cheese, G
You can stand in line, but you ain't gettin' it
Talk all the shit you want, but I ain't sweatin' it

[Hook]
