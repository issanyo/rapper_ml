(Only when I'm high)
I just need a little bit of medication
(Only when I'm high)
I don't even wanna have a conversation
(Only when I'm high)
And the feeling that I get is so amazing
(Only when I'm high)
When we smoking everyday's a celebration
(Only when I'm high)

Like la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Keep rolling that la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Keep rolling that la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Keep rolling that la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Gotta keep rolling that

[Verse 1]
Best weed that you had in your life
High as a kite, on cloud nine
I could get you prescribed
Know you're fucking with the Dr. Greenthumb
Rule one, if not two
Check your crew
If they smoking like we smoking
Tell them adios
If they got the good green
Tell them vamonos
And if you drinking with me
Go 'head tragalo
And if you all got the green thumb
Pagalo
(Only when I'm high)
Weed innovator
High times like elevators
Nine times I could tell I'm higher
Than a skyscraper
I'll take her, tell her get in my ride
But I'm quick to drop her off if she's killing my vibe

When we smoking everyday's a celebration
(Only when I'm high)

Like la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Keep rolling that la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Keep rolling that la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Keep rolling that la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Gotta keep rolling that

[Verse 2]
Baby I could get you higher than the next man
No sweat, I'm rolling up the headband
I'm the jet man
Take off, never land
Like Peter Pan
Here I go, talking weed again
Smoking weed out the west coast
You just know there's no stress, though
Took her a while to admit it
That I got the best smoke
Coughing cause I got a
Chisel of smoke
A bitch on a boat
A mission to go
And no I can't float with
You if I don't know you
(And only when I'm high)
Dabbing the wax out
I'll be damned if I pass out
I'm all in the papers
Smoking the vapors
She got her ass out
I'm taking the cash route
Then I'm going home
Smoking weed while I'm on the road
That's what you call a rolling stone

(Only when I'm high)
I just need a little bit of medication

And the feeling that I get is so amazing

When we smoking everyday's a celebration
(Only when I'm high)

Like la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Keep rolling that la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Keep rolling that la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Keep rolling that la, la, la, la
Keep smoking that la, la, la
Gotta keep rolling that
