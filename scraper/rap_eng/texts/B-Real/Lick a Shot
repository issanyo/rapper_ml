[Intro]
(Oh yeah it is!)
(Colour is not important)
Lick a shot!
(Oh!)
Comin' at ya
(Fire!)

[Verse 1]
Zippedy do da, zippedy hey
Cried oh my, wanna get that punk with my AK
And get on the way
On a mission, puffin' on a fat ass jay
Prude! You can't hang
Flash back on the skills when I used to bang
On the corner
I'll warn ya
Gonna roll on ya
Fool
Hit ya with a golden rule
Don't turn your back on the street
When I hit that corner, feel the concrete
If ya push that by like nothin'
Watch me turn to a psycho all of a sudden
Blastin' at these fools with a passion
Look at the Glock when it's time for some action

[Chorus]
Let the gatt hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gatt hummm

Let the gatt hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gatt hummm

[Verse 2]
Sunday morning
Wake up it's stormin'
Raindrops fallin' on my head it's pourin'
Cats an' dogs
Pigs in a wagon
Lookin' for the Afro - one that's saggin'
Scooby-Doo
An' fucked down too
Ploy me
Don't let your punk ass try me
Gonna take more
Then you better call your backup team
And wait for the crew
I'm the one flippin'
Keepin' the clip
On my hip an'
Just watch your back if you're slippin'
Oooo
Where did that .22
Come from
When the bullet past through my lung
I've lost my breath I'm winded
I've been hit, by a slug that wasn't intended
I hear thunder
I wonder
If a nigga like me's goin' under
Take a number!

[Chorus]
Let the gatt hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gatt hummm

Let the gatt hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gatt hummm

[Verse 3]
Had a bad dream
Woke up in a casket
Now I can't even get back at the bastard
Bull-shit!
This pine box
Ain't strong enough to contain the Afro Marx
Critical bell rings
Snapped out the dream
What the fuck's up with the funny red beam
Pointin' at me
I got no strap G
What now: gotta duck, they're gonna gatt me
Bam, I feel numb
Where did the shotgun blast come from

[Chorus]
Let the gatt hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gatt hummm

Let the gatt hummm
Lick a shot!
So I let the gatt hummm
