Chopper city in my neighborhood
South Baton Rouge
Nigga, what?
4's up, 4's down
Long clips and choppers
In this hood where they don't give a damn
From the top to the bottom
It's Chopper City in the ghetto, yeah, we on that lever
Flippin' and turnin', I hope you niggas 'bout whatever
50 or 100 man, we'll send you to the devil
I work this bitch like donkey or last level
Every block gotta chopper or two to clear the whole set
Don't give a fuck when it's time to bust
From the top the the bottom they don't give a fuck
Nigga get them choppers out the closet and come and hit you up
Extended clips rip a hole in your fuckin' stomach
When the war over with that's when they really comin'
So I take my fuckin' money and I buy 'em all
'Cause my niggas be in beef summer, winter, spring and fall
It's Iraq in the hood, ain't really no stacks in the hood
They puttin' choppers in your face up in South Baton Rouge
Cut the barrel, make it short, that's that track shit
Catch you at the red light, smashin'
Long clips and choppers
In this hood where they don't give a damn
From the top to the bottom
2009, man, these niggas ain't playin'
Long clips and choppers
Choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers
From the top to the bottom
2009, man, these niggas ain't playin'
Remember tryna snatch a purse in the South
And now I'm slangin' choppers with a hundred round burst in that South
I ain't got no scared aim, I ain't shootin' through no car
I do walk ups and stand offs, put barrels in your mouth
For my boulevard niggas, DB and Dane
Still send the money, all this for real, I never change
Motherfuck, weak fans, it's a uptown thang
I fuck with cane and I'mma die behind this lane
You niggas ain't no killas, you niggas shootin' in the air
And since Ben gone, I never play fair
Catch a nigga broad day, no mask, I'm bare
Like fuck a rap for real, bitch, come take this bloodbath
Say fool, on the real I fuck with you
But fuck them other niggas that ain't nothin' like they do
They don't throw 'em like we throw 'em, they don't bone like we bone
It's a uptown thang so they find they can't cope
Long clips and choppers
In this hood where they don't give a damn
From the top to the bottom
2009, man, these niggas ain't playin'
Long clips and choppers
Choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers, choppers
From the top to the bottom
2009, man, these niggas ain't playin'
