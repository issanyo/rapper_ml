[Verse 1]
They say what the must to gain our trust
But once the ballot's cast they forget about us
Standing on a mountain high above the downtrodden
They forgot about Michigan like all is magnificent
Sitting back watching the news with [?]
They manifest [?]
Simple [?] building up in my chest
Depressed enough to fight back 'cos we settled for less
Waiting for change to come
We get none but a brother like me begun to be another one
To run up in the party, crash it
Put up a wall? We smashit

[Pre-Chorus]
Wrecking ball to the wall
(To the wall)
Keep small, take them all
(Take them all)
Killing bills, pile up
Everybody stand up, come on!

[Chorus]
It's the same old lies time after time
(I can't abide, don't cross these lines)
You'll never read my American mind
(It's the same old lies time after time)
It's the same old lies time after time
(They don't like my kind, I can read the signs)
Don't ever read my American mind
(It's the same old lies time after time)

[Verse 2]
New year's beginning, new beginning again
Backspin, rewind my timeline within
We be coming down fifty five thousand feet
Here we come we go Molotov
Become the gun
The mission, the music, the force
Freedom, border walls
Yes to the beat y'all
Backed by Marshall stacks against murder in the name of the law
They're killing in the name of the Lord
People to the power, power to the people
And the beat's once again raging on the stage
Feel the burn, coming for the power, six pack
Save the babies
Prophets on attack, we smashit

[Pre-Chorus]
Wrecking ball to the wall
(To the wall)
Keep small, take them all
(Take them all)
Killing bills, pile up
Motherfucker stand up, come on!

[Chorus]
It's the same old lies time after time
(I can't abide, don't cross these lines)
You'll never read my American mind
(It's the same old lies time after time)
It's the same old lies time after time
(They don't like my kind, I can read the signs)
Don't ever read my American mind
(It's the same old lies time after time)

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Wrecking ball to the wall
(To the wall)
Keep small, take them all
(Take them all)
Killing bills, pile up
Motherfucker stand up, come on!

[Chorus]
It's the same old lies time after time
(I can't abide, don't cross these lines)
You'll never read my American mind
(It's the same old lies time after time)
Yeah, the same old lies time after time
(They don't like my kind, I can read the signs)
You'll never read my American mind
Smashit
