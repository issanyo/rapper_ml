[Intro: The Doors]
I'm in pain, man
I feel the universe functioning perfectly
But I'm still perfectly locked inside myself
Instead of oneness and I feel isolation

[Hook: Big Duke]
What type of drugs do you do?
And what do you do to get your hands on your shit mothafucka, huh!?
What kind of dirty tricks you do to get yourself fixed?
You're all sick; is it lack of love? or lack of your withdrawal?
Drugs!, I need feminine venoms in the system
In order to function in the rhythm

[Verse 1: Big Duke]
You get hooked to the look of wild women
And wanna live in the land of the unforgiven
Habits turn bad once individuals make 'em poison rituals
Gotta have it to have it, a habit
Welcome your choices of an addict

[Verse 2: B-Real]
God forgive me for my bad habits
Drug addict, needle up in my vein, I got to have it
To kill the pain, you silly rabbit
Dig a hole under the sun to hide from the static
Automatic pressure got to kill it
Give some act-right juice so I could feel it
Ah, everything is all right
The eye of the needle cries out to the dark side
Lookin' inside through the outdoor, knockin'
But society won't let me in so I grab my stockin'
Put over my head and get the dough
Cause the needle is my God and Smack is my soul

[Verse 3: Sick Jacken]
Paraphernalia in my domain brings conclusion
That I'm using but the question is, am I abusing?
Infested in the residence of Pico Union
Drug intrusion, color fusion
Invasion! of your senses maintain relapse
Dilate eye lenses, my dependence on the chemical
Artificial dreams is what makes my habit obscene

[Hook:  Big Duke]

[Verse 4: Sick Jacken]
Tinted like the darkest shadows, my mind is cloudy
Subliminal commands will penetrate then I get rowdy
Conditions drowsy, the sedative brings negative energy
I slump down and stay ahead of me
Powerful like metamphetamines, my state is altered
This here's no lie hydroponic, chronic
Got you feeling all erotic
Aphrodisiac, who's got it?
Alvarado maniacs risk prison time buying dimes
When you got the fix get in the mix
There's no denying, drugs be the only factor
Got me in the rapture making an addict out of you
And proceed to capture your mind

[Verse 5: Big Duke]
You're mine, choke hold to your whole skull, substance uncontrolled
Who holds straight keys to locks and unlocks key holes
The structure of my trip is unstoppable
I'm 50 hits of the dot, all powerful
We go deranged and remain, living the last days in the haze of purple micro

[Verse 6: B-Real]
I remember when I was a high school star
Had the prom queen, scholarship, brand new car
It's funny, you never know who your friends are
'Till you lose all your sensibilities to the dark
From the act-right but I'm all wrong
No wonder my family don't wanna have nothing to do with me
Humiliation, neglect, no respect
The concept of rehabilitation has been swept
I wish I was clean, a far fetched dream
But what other way am I going to blow off my steam?

[All Together]
Heaven's all in this bottle of juice

[B-Real]
Making me feel high

[Sick Jacken]
Making me feel loose

[Big Duke]
Got nowhere turn to
No one trusts me, I don't even trust myself
