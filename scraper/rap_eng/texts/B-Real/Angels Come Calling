[Hook]
When the reaper calls your name, ain't nowhere to hide
Always remeber one thing, you're living on borrowed time
See tomorrow's not promised, no matter how bad you want it
That's why I'm going all in, 'til them angels come calling
'Til them angels come calling, for me


[Verse 1: B-Real]
Indeed I been here before so much of the same shit
People say they want a war but they busting the same clips
But really the game split with so many blame shits
Distinction is no more in, so many name slip
But I´m kicking in the door I don't have to explain this
I´m leaving, they stayin flowing as soon as the pain hits
I'm coming for crowns and you're scared at the reign bitch
I'm like kobe with the ball, I shouted the dream squish
I do this in fame which, it's truly a strange ditch
This game it's so thankless but I put up a raised fist
One thing will rerises man …
This is your brain on me, this high as your brain get´s
With one life, listen, my mission — invade whip
They call me greenthumb son, don't play I'm a layin tricking
When the breakdown come, its the end of your fame slip

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Demrick]
It's all out war for what I believe in
At the liqour store serving up doses, fienin
When the cops come we start bobbing and weaving
Running and ducking, weed got me coughing and weezin
Why you try speak about the predicament we in
Most time you ever spend in a city's a weekend
And I swear to God they all try to push me off of the deep end
Cuz at your lowest point is when this wild thoughts creep in
Could my mind be playin tricks on me
Cuz I feel like somebody coming for me
That's why I treat every day like my last day
More chatter with less suffer get it the fast way
Before my flame gets put out like a ashtray
I'mma make this song, let's go and get the world a gasface
You stuck runnin in last places
And Don't nobody give a fuck what your ass say
Do you think you can wild out and act safe
Cuz in that case give me that motherfucking gun

[Hook]
