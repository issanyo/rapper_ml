(This one goes out to all you punk motherfuckers out there
Yeah, eat a bowl of dick'up putos!
Do ya wanna get crazy?
Comin' at 'cha in 93'!)

Through the car swings the firing pins
Go click when I duck behind the trash bin
Ran out of ammo no doubt
My gat is dry like a fuckin' drought
Got to make my way home, hit the gate and get my chrome
Hot damn it's on
They got me cornered lemme just warn ya
I'll pull this trigga make your family mourn'ya
Boo-hoo! Where ya gonna run to
When I pull out the scooby doo
Run! Let me break ya off some
Hit the floor cuz it ain't no fun
But here they come, they must wanna get done
No frontin'. Punk I'll break ya off somethin'!

(1 2 3 that coppa goes down!)

What the fuck I'm rollin'
In a Mack truck that's stolen
Guess what I'm holdin'
Ammo to bust my load
Still I'm easin' on down
The yellow brick road

Whatta ya know? A pig in a plain brown
Wrapper, he wanna bring me down
I'll hit that corner, lemme just warn ya
I'll bring ya ass down make ya family mourn ya
21 gun salute, trying to take my loot
Don't make me shoot
I'll hit my blunt and pass you a lump
And punk let me break ya of something

(break em' off some)

I got to roll with the self control
In the green tank when the shit unfolds
Hold up. I got it sewn up
Me and my niggas are about to blow up
Got the pigs on my tail, what they get
Is the hollow point shell
Caught in the cell
Servin' my sentence, got my apprentice
In the hood but the nigga is senseless
Out on parole, now the nigga has
Turned to my fold, now the punk gotta go
That punk got shady, woudn't repay me
Let the punk know that ya still can't fade me
Maybe the fucker would stop, But nothin'
Would stop me from havin' to break'em off something

(On to the next spot kid
We ain't havin it yall
Ya know what I'm talkin bout
I'm about to break your ass of some'n!
Commin from a whamm-o)
