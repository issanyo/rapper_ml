[Verse 1: B-Real & Berner]
Livin' dreams doesn't seem fair
Came in the game with a mean pair, look here
Someone with an iron fist, no fear
Came to smoke the world out, sincere
Fuck it, one big smoke box
Windows up with the doors locked, full stop
(Lemonade) Insane with the strains
So many gains, so many lanes, and many lames
Blow 'em out like DMT
On blast like TMZ, don't fuck with me
Got the state of Cali sown up
In door, out door, all grown up
Bring the Jack back
Talkin' like that
We on your head like a snapback
Shit, they ain't ever brought a pack back
All my bags still move quick
Two bricks, high speed chases, we lose pigs
Yeah, I ball like Big Mafi
Bay game, yeah, your bitch want me
She still pay me
I'm really rich, these hoes think I'm lazy
B, why this Key Lime shit so tastey
From the Bay to L.A
I just slide in Mercedes
With bags full of good and fresh cut babies
The weed game been good lately
Yeah, it's like the coke wave in the 80's
Real money

[Hook: B-Real & Berner]
I can dream
I can dream and do anything Anything
Get the cream
Get the cream
Get everything Everything
Get a goal
Settle for nothin' and get nothin' Get nothin'
Tell or fall, I'mma ball out
Man, run it
Switched on
They'll remember me when I'm gone When I'm gone
And the story goes on & on On & on
Switched on
They'll remember me when I'm gone When I'm gone
And the story goes on & on On & on

[Verse 2: B-Real & Berner]
Bern's crashin' on the couch 'cause the flower's strong
Rollin' the QP, smokin' like an hour long
This is a power song from a power duo
Use the mic like a power tool
Don't hit the strain if you're scared of heights
These bitches are angels, they lead you to the light
Don't fight it, just roll it and light it
Yeah, I'm lifted
The weed we roll up is much different
Joints with the live resin drippin'
Whips with the European stitchin'
Chicks back stage takin' shots and keepin' weed twisted
Dog, we really live it
I used to dream about cards with no limits and uh, cars that we sit in
I'mma ball
And leave it all for my children
To count a couple million, that's a cold feelin'
It really is

[Hook: B-Real & Berner]
I can dream
