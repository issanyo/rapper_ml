[Verse 1]
Livin on fat pockets on flat with the gat
Rolling around nine deuce cadillac
Still got my homies to watch my back
And they'll smoke your ass if you wanna come and chat
That's why some pigs an the kids come sweating they follow
A hollow point shell's hard to swallow (heyy)
Why wallow when you come to roll on I put the clip an dust
Bring your ass on, kicking dust on your head as the gat busts
My cribs surrounded im about to get rushed, I brushed with death
How many shells stuffed in my closet?

[Hook]
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (you better be ready)

[Verse 2]
I told the boys get the sawed off Glock and the rest of the gats
As I strapped on the bullet-proof vest
BOOM, I think I got one to the chest
Hot damn I didn't want to kill a man shit
I still stand tall with the hill clan ya'll better stand back
Niggas bout ta fall, I'm coming out blasting like Yosemite Sam
Got the cheese an the bread for the ham

[Hook]
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (when the shit goes down)
When the shit goes down you better be ready (you better be ready)
