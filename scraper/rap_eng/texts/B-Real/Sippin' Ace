[King Lil G]
These bitches know the name I told you I don't need an intro
Getting paid now I only smoke indo
Life is complicated but I never give a fuck
Calling on my family but nobody's picking up
Standing in the rain brainwashed by the Thugs
Standing in the courtroom in front of the judge
Gang related issues homie all of the above
Pussy ass cops put me on handcuffs
Friendship and money man is never going last long
On my ex bitches that's the reason they get passed on
King Lil G bitch I'm way above the average
I grab the sky when dead damn bitch
Tony Montana man I'm about to get a mansion
Hold me up and cut a hates one I'm getting cash with

[Hook]
I don't think about pass anymore
I don't trust my enemies try to blast me before
I don't think about pass anymore
I don't think about the bitches that had me before

Birthday was the worst day
Now we sippin' ace when we thirsty
Birthday was the worst day
Now I'm sippin' ace when I'm thirsty

[B-Real]
You don't know my name you can call me Dr. Greenthumb
