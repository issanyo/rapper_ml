[Verse 1: B-Real]
Couldn't believe your eyes when you seen what the fuck is comin'
Psyclones, all you sorry mothafuckas runnin'
The city has turned to renegades with guns and blades
And criminals seekin' to get paid
I maintain, keep cool headed
In the face of destruction whether I live or die
Unpredictable, invincible, untameable, individual
Uncontrollable like a psycho, deadly
So let us begin to take your mind
To another plane cause I know you ain't ready
The course of the cyclone is steady
So who in their right mind
Would get in the way of the machete?
The serpent fuckin' with me
In the turbulent times of war on the street
Grab your fuckin' heat
Come with me inside the whirlwind
Everybody's welcome into the Psycho's Den

[Hook: Big Duke]
Even though we don't know the attack's exact origin
Man made diseases show traces of an assassin
The government went deranged and came blastin'
Tryin' to finish us off with poisoned rations

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
As you sleep, nightmares and dreamscapes awake
Now it's time to renovate
Use thoughts and plots to elevate
Violence is like cellophane, storing all you renegades
The only thing is you're already spoiled
So now you play the game
Teams are spread out all over your city
Mobile with your Lo-Lo
On 520's and 560's
Guns and drugs are spread into your town
You must realize, open your eyes wide
The drama will be televised
Revolution waitin' for your input like dial tones
Strap on the psyclone's takin' your zone
Grab your weapon, keep steppin'
If you don't defend
Don't mention it to anybody who questions
Step into the eye and die, you've been shook and took
By madman, psycho slash crook

[Verse 3: Big Duke]
The cities' survival depends on defense methods
We bring L.A. to the stage, live coverage
Methods are jagged like pieces of broken records
Are now shanks we abuse in the holding tanks
It's going down in the middle of downtown
Out of line, confined to get checked and robbed blind
Vigilante to protect and serve the people
Violent sequel 'til the evil and death equal

[Hook: B-Real]
Even though we don't know the attack's exact origin
Man made diseases show traces of an assassin
The government went deranged and came blastin'
Tryin' to finish us off with poisoned rations

[Verse 4: Big Duke]
The day you could feel what I feel
Life in the battlefield, facin' fuckin' steel, no shield
Puppet governments on the streets
To confiscate C.B.'s, batteries and M.C.'s

[Verse 5: B-Real]
Look at the deep thoughts dwelling within' your mind
Do you got what it takes to survive the city of the blind?
Everyone follow and let your soul feel free
Can you keep up or will you fall behind me?

[Verse 6: Big Duke]
Look for spies near telephones
Neighborhood informants, tappin' into your dial tones
Televisions act as cameras also
Enemies program your box of cables

[Verse 7: Sick Jacken]
Invasion of your spaces calls for rowdy occasion
Deliberate attacks on your stacks means retaliation
Can you succeed in leaving the other side bleeding?
Can you succeed in leaving the other side bleeding?
Or will they defeat my street fleet?
Can you succeed in leaving the other side bleeding?
