Zeus: "Make certain that no stone stands
That no creature crawls
I command you to let lose the last of the Titans"

"It's time to strike!"

[B-Real]
Let the rain pour down from God above
With the blood of my blade, no love, begin the flood
Open the gates, let the battle begin, wherein
With wind at our backs, ready for any attacks
Sound the horns, prepare for war, begin the storm
The flaming arrows hitting your body, keeping you warm
With the uniform of my sworn enemies
You raped and pillaged my city, and spread disease
Feel the sword of the warrior's wrath, the path you take
Can lead to the math that the master's break
The clash of the titans, are you frightened of loss
Fighting with the cause to free, you and yours, and God's law
Look in the stars, aligned with sign and Mars
Destruction, what's your function, you roll with God

The soul of the master's elements, disaster
Breaking ya faster, transmitting the broadcaster
The blade swings, slashing your throat
The vision's on the mission, seeking the note
Dropping the bomb, by remote
Load up the cavalry's, no salaries, the keys
The life's memories, strife bringing the thieves
Cut the heads off, hide in the loft, don't even cough
Or breath, pay the cost, moving your life's lost
Let the spirit reunite, with your weapon, you wanna fight
Hear the sound of the warriors stepping into the night
The eye in the sky, looking to punish ya, never hide
No cover to shelter your life, the souls begin to rise
And to clash

"Attention"  2x

[B-Real]
God's enemies, fall in upon, the knees crawling
Beheading the dead souls, who runaway from their calling
Behold, the white horse, remorse, never the case
Every corner of the world, the battle is taking place
Let the war drum set the pace, you face fire
Resume, from the Temple of Boom, and seek higher thought
Maybe you live, or maybe not, the blade's hot
Many renegades ready for battle, die on the spot
With one shot, one whole city becomes rocked
The clash rages on, people remain calm
Good, bad, all in the balance, you going mad
You can never tell, heaven or hell, the blood shed
And it's all around, you can't run, sit in the cell
When the war's over, the light will shine, covering the spell
Celebrate now, put the blades to rest
No wickedness, only the blessed will hold down

"Attention"
"You creating hysteria"
