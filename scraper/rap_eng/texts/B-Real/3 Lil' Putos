"Live and direct"

One little two little three little putos
Tried to jack me they got the boot-o
Taking no shit when push comes to shove
Cause a nigga showed me no love
Step back punk cause I'm a Latino
What I bring you is the hardcore lingo
Funky, but ya don't understand
Now I gotta stand with the Glock in my hand
No scope
And there's no hope
Cause I'm dishin'
Out my .45 slug and it ain't missin'
Here it comes hissin'
Here it comes hummin' at ya
Now the slug is comin' at ya

One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run

Cuando entro, loaded is the cuete
Speakin' to the gente
Cause I'm insane in the mente
Movin' em back, click-click goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
It's no fun
When I got to break you off some
Of the psycobeta beatdown, boy you get done
Serio
Here we go
Come for the muchacho
I don't think you really want some of these chingazos
Me caso you don't hear this little lazo
Cypress Hill, breaking you off a pedazo
Humming at ya
Don't make me come gatt ya
Punk cause I still will be comin' at ya

One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run

When I come in, kickin' with a vengeance
Swift of the engines
Coming like the three little indians
Stompin' around on the ground on the plains
Cause a nigga like me is goin' insane
In the brain
So I gotta maintain
My direction
What I mighta gained
Without my protection
Not a damn thing
So when I come just bring
That new style, break ya off like a chicken wing
Buckooock!!
So you can just suck my cock
Like a fat blunt, stoned is the way of the walk
When I'm peepin'
Checkin' out the punk-ass creepin'
I let the dogs loose then I let the dogs sick 'em
Graaah! Nigga don't make me catch ya
Punk cause I still will be comin' at ya

One little two little three hoodlums
Gotta hit the ground cause here the slug comes
What do you know, click clack goes the gun
Make 'em run boy, make 'em run boy, make 'em run
