[Hook: B-Real]
I got an angel on one shoulder, devil on the other
And I just sit around and watch 'em argue with each other
I got a devil on one shoulder, angel on the other
And I just sit around and watch 'em argue with each other

[Verse 1: Belly]
Lone disciple, praying for his own survival
He keep a Holy Bible by a loaded rifle
Seen him at church, praying for his only daughter
Went home and tried to whip the work in the holy water
Playing Devil's advocate, I told him it was blasphemous
He told me I was hash in this hell, I never asked for this
And how you playing poor when you wearing Himalayan dope
If you ain't on this wave you won't stay afloat
They don't relate, I burn the bridges big as Golden Gate
And buy a yacht that look just like the one that Noah made
There's no escape, I hold the Aces, fuck a poker face
So if you really are a G, you must be lowercase

[Hook: B-Real]
I got an angel on one shoulder, devil on the other
And I just sit around and watch 'em argue with each other
I got a devil on one shoulder, angel on the other
And I just sit around and watch 'em argue with each other

[Verse 2: Belly]
They say it's drug abuse when I'm the one the drugs abuse
No wonder why I get the hate and love confuse
Got caught winter cold with the Summer blues
I keep at least twelve bitches, you got like one or two
The shits, the shits, you know we're really with it
Bitch I gave you a future, but you ain't seen me in it
You live a lie that's why you can't believe we did it
I'm celebrating with my dogs like "we really did it"
Hoes say they love me for me, I say to each they own
I'm always up, even when I'm home she gon' sleep alone
Fuck is up? Beat it up, hit it with an uppercut
These bitches only going down cause he coming up
Who knew I'd obtain that way back when I weighed packs
Broke as shit, I wrote this shit when I was in KPAX
(Straight facts) Six hundred Maybach
Broke nigga, you ain't even know that they made that

[Hook: B-Real] x2
I got an angel on one shoulder, devil on the other
And I just sit around and watch 'em argue with each other
I got a devil on one shoulder, angel on the other
And I just sit around and watch 'em argue with each other
