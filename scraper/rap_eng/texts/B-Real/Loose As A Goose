[Intro: Lil Boosie]

Uh oh loose as a goose
I be loose as a goose
Loose as a goose
I be loose as a goose
Loose as a goose
Loose as a goose
Loose as a goose

[Chorus: Lil Boosie]

I be loose as a goose don't get me started
Two shots of Patron now I’m on in the party
Loose as a goose don’t get me started
With a clique of thug niggas when I step off in da party
I be loose as a goose don't get me started
Full of that liquor when I step up off in the party
Loose as a goose don't get me started
Goin' off at them jiggas when I step up off in the party

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]

Nah nah nah nah
Don't get me started
Cause I'll wild out and cock the Glock 40
Nah nah nah nah
Don't get me started
Cause it can get retarded yeah heard me retarded
Got a body bag
And a couple masks
I bust his ass and I pop another half
Comin through the club man I got my own swag
Don't look wrong cause I will get on your ass
Goons on deck all my niggas acting bad
Wipe me down I'm on girl I'm Boosie Badass
That liquor got me trippin can I have you girl (please)
Can you give me head in the bathroom girl (please)
Four car garage man I'm in my own world
Neck full of pieces
Bitch you gotta see me
Always good lookin
My mouth kind of crooked
I be loose out in Century bookin
I'm Boosie Badass

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 2: Foxx]

I'll be looser than a freak hoe
That fuck n give ya deep throat
We in the Club Depot
My tolerance is zero
When I be in the club you already know the dealio
V.I.P be full of bad bitches like a video
We standing where the door at
We buying all the Moet
You better take your hoe and leave if we ain't got ya hoe yet
I'm loose like a goose
With a deuce of that juice
It might slow your ass down but to me it is a boost
I'm a motherfucking gangster in the club where the G's at
N they ain't talking cars when they ask where them keys at
Make ya OI lady put her head where her knees at
You don't break it off theyll find out where them leaves at
Dolla Dolla bill all a nigga really need
I knew how to count the money before I knew how to read
Let that choppa go and knock a nigga arm out his sleeve
Cause when I get loose somebody child gone bleed

[Chorus x1]

[Verse 3: Mouse]

I say "Hakuna Matata"
That's how I'm feeling
Nigga look up at the roof
Yeah it's me I'm to the ceiling
Where them tabs at nigga
I'm really an willing
Throw it back throw it back
I'm in the motherfucking building
Nigga do what cha do
But watch my sneakers
I spent good money
Step on em and I sneak ya
Nigga I am to pieces
Like I got the wiggles
[?] Boosie [?] they body
Yeah you know he on them Jiggas
A cig up in my mouth
A cup up in my hand
A [?] right beside me doing the murder man dance
Don't think about beef nigga you ain't got a chance
Last night I had ya bitch up in a three point stance
I hop up on the stage tell DJ just run it
I fuck with real niggas that gone keep it 100
Where my mind where my mind at
I think its been lost
In a club like a chicken with my head cut off

[Chorus x1]
