Who you tryin' to get crazy with ese?
Don't you know I'm loco?

To the one on the flamboyant tip
I'll just toss that ham in the fryin' pan
Like spam
Get done when I come and slam
Damn
I feel like the Son of Sam
Don't make me wreck s***
Hectic
Next, get the chair
Got me goin' like General Electric
Eeen, the lights are blinking
I'm thinking
It's all over when I go out drinking
Oh, makin' my mind slow
That's why I don't f*** wit da big four-o
Bro', I got ta maintain
'Cause a n****, like me, is goin' insane

Insane in the membrane
(Insane in the brain!)
Insane in the membrane
(Insane in the brain!)
Insane in the membrane
(Crazy insane)
(Got no brain!)
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!

Do my s*** undercover
Now it's time for the blubba
Blabber
Watch that belly get fatter
Fat boy on a diet
Don't try it
I'll jack your a** like a looter in a riot
My s***'s fat like a sumo slammin' dat a**
And leavin' your face in the grass
Cos you know, I don't take dulo lightly
Punks just jealous 'cause they can't outwrite me
Or kick that style: wicked, wild
Happy face n****, never seen me smile
Rip that mainframe
I'll explain
A n**** like me is goin' insane

Insane in the membrane
(Insane in the brain!)
Insane in the membrane
(Insane in the brain!)
Insane in the membrane
(Crazy insane)
(Got no brain!)
Insane in the membrane
Insane in the brain!
Insane in the membrane
Insaaayyaaaayyyaaaane
Insane in the brai.. ainnnnn...
