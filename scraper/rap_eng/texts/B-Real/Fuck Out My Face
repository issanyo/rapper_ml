[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Get the fuck outta my face
Get the fuck outta my face

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Who's Dr. Greenthumb? Anybody seen him?
Not another white bitch, time for a re-run
Need some green sum, seen some homie
Send you a ton but I keep some homie
King of Queen, the kind you blaze
Whole team on lean on Pisa sway
I'm ghetto and the pump got a critter all splattered
Have another hit but I want to hit the shatter
Dabbing all night really got me faded
Take a hit of my shit feel upgraded
Twist that shit like your weave got braided
Chilling in the palm trees feeling real shaded
Pass that shit like a deadly virus
She want to hit, that's Miley Cyrus
Hit it so hard, my god, she likes this
Change that chick's name to Miley Cypress

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
A$AP Fergie, A$AP Mobbin'
Bitches on my ballsack, want a nigga Martian
And a Miss America, picking any target
Bitch give me long neck like an ostrich
Aston Matthews in an Aston Martin
Vroom, driving retarded
Sipping on that Crissy cause a nigga really ballin'
Headed to the telly with a bunch of Kelly Clarksons
They love that I'm from Harlem
They love to see a broad and
Another broad and kiss and massage 'em
Give them booty shots might Nicki Minaj 'em
Dont let 'em get me hard then
Tell they friend give me jaws like a shark fin
You'll play Halle Berry in Monster Ball and
I'll be Trap Lord Billy Bob Thornton

[Verse 3: A$ton Matthews]
Oh shit, who let these Hulk Hogan hoes in with nose and chest open?
That water hose got us sipping, that Molly Maid got us dripping
Okay, I get that A$AP, A$AP
Take naps from the K clap, I'll bring it where you lay at
Gang colder than the face off, you don't want to face that
Got these hoes dripping out the Versace, 4-4's keep the 4's off
Four boats so the hoes drop and that rose gold keep the dome sloppy
Haaan, molly party, molly party
Them bitches know it's a molly party
Dodging cases cause I'm dropping bodies
Number one stunner, camouflage Hummer
Nose job, had to paint it white for the summer
I'm a hit stick drummer, heavyweight
Triple H, Hall of Fame head hunter
Minivan gram Van Dam, hand in hand in the Trans-Am
Choppas all test tap dance, Hammer Time Ham dance
Put that pussy on a hand stand

[Hook: A$ton Matthews]
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face

[Verse 4: Fredro Starr & Sticky Fingaz]
Yeah, better get the fuck out my face with all that
Or get a broken beat down with a baseball bat
Ferg said call a nigga A$AP back
Oh, just looking for his baseball bat
I'm a thug with a baseball cap
Got a bad bitch slim waist from the back
Ass ain't fat but her face all that
Oh, she like to fuck in my baseball cap
I'm a CB-GB, Crazy Baldhead Grimy Bastard
You a BG-GB, Bitch that's Gonna Get Blasted
So don't set trip cause I love to trip
My niggas trip, acid
I don't give a fuck if it's fake or real
Those titties coulda been plastic
Official Nast', my gang's official
Mad faced niggas with anger issues
Hundred mad niggas got a gang of pistols, blaow
Now how the fuck can a stranger miss you?
My whole set, ganged up
Play yourself get ya banged up
Suicide, you get hanged up
She done fuck the crew, she got ganged up
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
I'll pull the heat out my mothafuckin' waist
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
I'll pull the strap out my mothafuckin' waist

[Outro: B-Real]
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
Get the fuck out my mothafuckin' face
