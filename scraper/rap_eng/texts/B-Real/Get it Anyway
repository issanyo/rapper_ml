[Verse 1]
I'mma do my thing
Let me tell you right now
'Cause I don't know any other way
Of living my life now
Some of you know the struggle
Some of you live in a bubble
Some like you hustlin
And some of you just looking for trouble
I don't follow or lead
Tommorows a dream
Pray to god to intervene
On all the sorrow I've seen
You want out of here
You can leave when you wanna
Nothing can stop you
If thats your type of persona
Life is shorter now
Don't make me say it ten times
I keep going for mine
Even in the end times
I can beat the system
Come on and say it with me:
Show me some optimism
We can take over the city!

[Hook]
This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway!
I'mma get it anyway!
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway!
I'mma get it anyway!

[Verse 2]
There comes a time in your life
You gotta go for yours
Staying paid
Is like the battle of forever more
I stay pedal to the metal
Foot on the floor
Earn my keep on the streets
Knocking down your doors
I'm by the dollar
Like everybody oughta be
Don't burn nobody
And make the money honestly
Open your home with the internet technology
I get it anyway
Despite of the economy
See I ain't coughin
Unless it makes a profit
I'm dropping this so hot shit
Like every day gossip
Regardless of the climate
I'm gonna get it everyday
Even if the bullets spray
I'm gonna get it anyway

[Hook]
This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway!
I'mma get it anyway!
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway!
I'mma get it anyway!

(Sing)
La la la la la

La la la la la
(All around the world)
La la la la la
(My peoples getting money)
La la la la la
(Let me hear you sing)

So let em hear us holla
Or we'll guide us by the collar
Making it harder for you
Don't wanna make an honest dollar
You wanna sip a little
To make your pain numb
Tippin that bottle
Got you forgettin where you came from
But I'm the same one
Where you think my name's from
I'mma keep it moving
And never stop till the game's done
Forever we live it, forever we spit it
Remember the minute
You witnessed the realest that ever did it
(Quit it!)
Still I'm committed
No matter what I hear from the critic
People can see through a gimmick
I'm putting on a clinic
We in troubled times
Swerving through the double lines
You run ahead on collision course
Now you served your time

[Hook]
This is for my real life representers, down since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grinding out around the way
Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Have to get it, they won't give it, but I get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma go and do my thing!
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I'mma get it anyway
I'mma go and do my thing!
