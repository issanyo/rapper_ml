[Verse 1:  Chuck D]
The bridge, the call
The ceiling, the floor
The feeling like goin' take a riot to the wall
The governments can't stand when the people take a stand
Put mind over matter in their minds we don't matter man

[Pre-chorus: Chuck D & B-Real]
Cross them borders
Swim their waters
Reject their orders
Lost their daughters
Change their ways
Rearrange their days
Gasoline that rag
Burn that fuckin' flag

[Chorus: Chuck D & B-Real]
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who (systematic breakdown)
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who
We fuckin' matter!
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who (systematic breakdown)
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who
We fuckin' matter!

[Verse 2:  B-Real]
We feel so small
We give our all
The pride
The fall
The soldier's standin' tall
The government can't stand when the people take a stand
Put mind over matter in their minds we don't matter man

[Pre-chorus: Chuck D & B-Real]
Cross them borders
Swim their waters
Reject their orders
Lost their daughters
Change their ways
Rearrange their days
Gasoline that rag
Burn that god damn flag

[Chorus: Chuck D & B-Real]
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who (systematic breakdown)
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who
We fuckin' matter!
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who (systematic breakdown)
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who
We fuckin' matter!

[Break]

[Chorus: Chuck D & B-Real]
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who (systematic breakdown)
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who
We fuckin' matter!
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who (systematic breakdown)
Know your rights, but you should understand
Who owns who
We fuckin' matter!

[End break]
