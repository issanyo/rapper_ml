[Intro]
I could feel my heart beat (Blazin, Blazin) x2

[Verse 1: Berner]
I remember watching Friday
Waiting for my mom's car
To slide out that driveway
Walked down to Walgreens
Trying to buy some papers (zig zag)
They was hating, So I left
With a coke and some now & laters
My boy had the smoke
Take out the seeds
Reggie rolled up
In a Walgreens receipt
The joint burning crazy
I barely caught a buzz
Rolled another one, then another one
I was done
I ain't feel nothing
Flew to Cali for a week
I missed home
Nothing like that Northern California breeze
See my old friends
Their brothers all smoking weed
Cryo bags full of light green
The best I ever seen
They told me little bro
Come take a hit
They call this Nade
You only need a little bit
I told them chill
The first time I ain't feel it
Took a hit and
Felt like my head was floating in the ceiling
I could hear my fucking heart beat
I kept laughing
Then I asked him
How long is this lastin'?
He just smiled and replied
"Is this the first time that you ever been high?"

[Chorus]
I could hear my heartbeat (x12)
Blazin, So high

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Lit up the white girl
She was the first to thrill me
She was the queen of the building
She had a thing for the green if you feel me
Taught me a lot about cycles
Taught me to harvest the [?]
Fillin' my lungs with the pipe
The weed was so young
But she gave me a [?]
Had me reaching for stars
Healing my scars
Told me to keep her in charge
Don't leave a roach in the car
Taught me to savor the flavor
Please understand my behavior
Light it and share with your neighbor
She even got love for the haters
Love burns, no right turns
We all step to that fire
Love hurts when it don't work
But she takes me up higher
Love burns, no right turns
We all step to that fire
Love hurts when it don't work
But she takes me up higher

[Chorus]
I can hear my heartbeat
