[Intro: Xzibit]
Huh, huh
Pull up on the weak and music leakin', you can’t fuck with us
Puerto Rican, huh

[Verse 1: Xzibit, C-Kan, & Demrick]
Pull up on the weak and music leakin', you can't fuck with us
Butter pecan mami, Puerto Rican, watch her fuck it up
Fuck it up, I end up listening C-Kan
Otra de Mexico para que sepan
Mr. C, exhibit C, el ghetto lo conocí
Y ahora tengo a los gabachos como diciendo que sí
In my pockets, tryna run me up
You ain’t even tryna suck these nuts
You gon' eat without gettin' my cut?
You gon' eat without gettin' my cut?
What? (Bitch)
Then you gon' starve, bitch, no free lunch
Me van a detestar cuando escuchen esta
Van a entender porque prefiero nunca contestar
Amo a mi enemigo como amo a mi barrio, ellos nunca me fallan
Sentados pollitos cantan papá gallo, y ustedes se callan
Arriba Jalisco, viva Mexico, cabrones
Flow Pancho Villa, trajimos puros pelones
Press don't need you, don't get pressed up
Send the bitches, gon’ set you up
I know it’s sad, bad, and all fucked up
Kill 'em all, do it for the rush, what

[Chorus: Xzibit & B-Real]
Day of the dead
Feelin’ higher than you've ever been
Ever been, ever been
In Jalisco with the medicine
Medicine, medicine
Rollers took the boys, God I need a friend
Transactions happen, never see my face again
Serial, Serial, Serial Killers (Killers)
Serial, imperial, boss killers (Killers)
Serial, Serial, Serial Killers (Killers)
Catch us if you can, the falls could kill a man (Kill it)

[Verse 2: Xzibit & B-Real]
I made a killin' with them motherfuckin' brass knuckles
Dr. Green Thumb, dispensary open to the public
Ha-ha-ha-ha, richer than a mothafucka
Doin’ things that I can't explain, man I'm blessed, brother
Move it up, never sit with down
Pour it out for my dead homies, then I roll a pound
Did you forget about us? Let me remind y'all
In the shadows, creepin' behind y'all
And it looks like I never hit
You know crashes, take your bitch
Put 'em on a rooftop, bait and switch
Chillin' on the rooftop, aim and click
Hit 'em with the headshot
See the body on the floor
No, didn't see the red dot
He bled out, metaphor
We kill shit, everything we touch is a head knock
Means home run, run home little bitch
Tell 'em what you seen here, we here
He's so stunned, outgunned
Put him on the run, stay clear, can't be here

[Verse 3: C-Kan]
Can-kush o Kan-OG, viajando en nube de humo
Como en el 2001, la vendo y me la fumo
Living la vida malandra, Guadalajara trajó la parranda, anda
Dime con los que tú andas, que a lo B-Real tú no entiendes la onda
Uh

[Chorus: Xzibit & B-Real]
Day of the dead
Feelin' higher than you've ever been
Ever been, ever been
In Jalisco with the medicine
Medicine, medicine
Rollers took the boys, God I need a friend (Hey)
Transactions happen, never see my face again
Serial, Serial, Serial Killers (Killers)
Serial, imperial, boss killers (Killers)
Serial, Serial, Serial Killers (Killers)
Catch us if you can, the falls could kill a man (Kill it)
