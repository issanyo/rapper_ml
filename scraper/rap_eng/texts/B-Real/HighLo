[Hook: French Montana]
High low, high low
Pull up in that 35, eyes low
My wip clean, my bitch mean
Came up from a 3 to a 17
She bendin it over, she bendin it over

[Verse 1: Takeoff]
High low, my ride low
Butterfly doors, my time froze
My backwood, on eggrolls
You cap so much, your nose started growing like Panokeo
I do the most, drop top centerfold
Hit my pinical, I'm the most wanted, you ain't know
Look like your wrist is broke, I smoke good good dope
Truckload, backin in, that's a potload

[Hook: French Montana]
High low, high low
Pull up in that 35, eyes low
My wip clean, my bitch mean
Came up from a 3 to a 17
She bendin it over, she bendin it over

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Smoke some cookie, we can get you hot
Pop a Perky, we can get you low
You ain't gotta let anybody know
We getting high low, sky high off the high dro
Wanna be my hoe, gotta be bad like Michael
Silly me, how could I forget about these mini me's
My enomies wanna be me, I hit him with the cleff, ever since my left hand left
I can't wait on ya, just bend it over
Bring it higher, drop it lower

[Hook: French Montana]
High low, high low
Pull up in that 35, eyes low
My wip clean, my bitch mean
Came up from a 3 to a 17
She bendin it over, she bendin it over

[Verse 3: Jazz Lazer]
I'm right insane, to the brain
I'm in my lane, watch her pop it, like my chain
My flowers gleemin, she got no shame
Her thirst is heavy, I don't know her name
Flip it, don't get it twisted, she won't miss it
She so pasific, she so spesific
She so explicit like a meal ticket
All ambitious, whole vision
So delicious, and she so vishous
Got you rapped, like an earli Christmas

[Hook: French Montana]
High low, high low
Pull up in that 35, eyes low
My wip clean, my bitch mean
Came up from a 3 to a 17
She bendin it over, she bendin it over
