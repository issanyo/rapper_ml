[Pre-Hook: B-Real]
We'll all rise to inform masses, engage, encounter
Extreme passages

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Through hallucinations, escape
Now every wicked ordeal regenerates, disgrace
Emotions ruined, intellectuals seduced including nations
Funded under loose lock
Evaluate friends, foreigners, enemies concentrate to penetrate
Reduce our time, elminate chances to yell out
Utlize, realize, survival essentials, lifestyle fundamentals
Attention to all nation's youth, continue our struggle
Trust no one, maintain and tell truth
And ridicule war, hunger and terror
Vicious individuals clever to often rule you
Whether individuals love or loathe
Behold enslavement, order united retaliation so
Fear is God hold true to obstruction
Thoroughly handing enemies' destruction
Elimination, avoid the humiliation

[Chorus: B-Real]
We'll all rise to inform masses, engage, encounter
Extreme passages
Enter, return, inside, eternal neglect
Cycles encouraging survival

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
Fighting original, underground generals
Hit their weakest intervals, two hundred sentinels
Infiltrate levels effectively not taken
Warning except automatic preparation
Override negative systems and new democracies
Secretly under battle, lost inside mystery
Initiating nuclear actions, lethal combat
Overdoses excessive so involved that civilians assist
Never trippin' after killin'
Every casualty opening mental position
Let elite take eventual control owning nations
To reveal only love of violent expansion, retaliation
To higher elevation, witness old revelation, lingering dication

[Hook: B-Real (x2)]
We'll all rise to inform masses, engage
Encounter extreme passages
Enter, return, inside, eternal, neglect
Cycles encouraging survival

[Verse 4: Big Duke]
Battling underground, intelligence
Leaving the defenses all numb and defenseless
On restless grounds, adolescent negligence
Intend zero evidence, years of underdeveloped races
Street technique, raises enemy encases
Tasteless authorities run mazes
In elite space and places rearranged evidence pages
All revealing establishment traces
Order in the courts, taking away kingdoms, endless
Anti-civilian tactics, indicate overthrowing national assassins
Guaranted actions, increases the nation
Securities, tensions, abusive badges, uniforms and stations
Inject vaccinations of elimination
Armies unauthorized to hide or rewrite institutional treaties in every state
Die no mistake
