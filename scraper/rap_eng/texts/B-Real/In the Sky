[Verse 1]
Yeah
This is empty bottle rap
I'm not a role model, You can go ahead and follow that
Rode to the unknown, all you gotta do is swallow that
Pill, and watch how you feel
Baby just relax, Detached from the norm'
Prepare for the storm
Sober up and relapse, I'll be back in the morn'
I'm just playing I'm high, get up in the zone
She a nine, but in my mind she a centerfold
And many chose, the path to sobriety
But stoned is the way I walk, through society
Momma said, "Son is you high? Don't lie to me"
I told her no, but she still beat the hell up outta me
Parallel reality, drained in my salary
Smokin' more than I'm selling, how can this be
True?
So now I'm sippin' on that 100 proof
Gettin' loose, I love to get faded
What can you do?

[Chorus]
I'm high up in the sky
And I can't come down
No, no
I'm lost up in this world
And I can't come down
No, no

[Verse 2]
I used to [?] the blue coupe, claiming that soo woo
No mercy for others, brother
That means you too, No regards for you and yours
Pullin' out the '44, put you on the floor
Face down; true story boy
The streets got an appetite, and it's never satisfied
Boulevard of broken dreams, but they'll never shatter mine
I own it and I'm glad it's mine
It's swing batter time, I'm going for the fences
Your opinion doesn't matter I'm, still rollin' thick as hell
Trigger finger's quick as well, I'm lookin' for the higher ground
I can make my pockets swell
Believe me when I say these streets are bloody, It ain't a game
Money, fortune, and fame are all callin' my name
And I can hear it in the background, as I lay the track down
Put the sack down, Po-po's are on the crackdown
I let the mic guide me, my pen is mighty
The track is like a woman screaming, "I want you inside me"

I'm high up in the sky
And I can't come down
No, no
I'm lost up in this world
And I can't come down
No, no

[Verse 3: Xzibit]
I used to be the dope man
Baking soda, cocaine
Copped a quarter Ki
At the time, thought I'm so paid
Never thought twice, in hindsight, I was lucky
I never did time, the one time never touched me
[?] 9 millimeter, ridin' in the front seat
Trust me, chopped yo fuckin' ass in a lunch meat
Did my first drive-by, my girlfriend drivin'
In her mom's 4 [?]
My niggas, I'm not lying
I'm lion-hearted, my instinct
King of the castle
I gotta be a dick, 'cause I'm surrounded by assholes
What more can I ask for?
Break neck diligence
Fast forward, to brains all over your dashboard
The landlord, let the hammer fall on the tenants
[?] Picked it from the game, 'cause your heart's not in it
And you're so dimwitted
When you spit it, man you don't go get it
Audio, hustlers, serial killin'

[Chorus]
I'm high up in the sky
And I can't come down
No, no
I'm lost up in this world
And I can't come down
No, no
