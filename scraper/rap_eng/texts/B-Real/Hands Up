[Intro]
Hands up, hands up, hands up, come on
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up, come on
Had enough, had enough, what the fuck?

[Verse 1:  B-Real]
It's a doubtful world, where they embrace the lies
Hear the songs they sing, are you hypnotized?
Can I sell you somethin'?  Let me tell you somethin'
You see I come from nothin', and my hands are callused
While the one percent, stay tippin' the balance
I'ma put 'em on blast, For the present and past
Put the nightstick away, keep it off my back
What the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck?

[Chorus]
Hands up, hands up, hands up, come on
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up, come on
Had enough, had enough, what the fuck?

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Past ain't just past, world ain't gonna last
Change itself and thrive, will he survive?
Cybermetric hat trip, trip on a backflip
Molotov matchsticks, are burning Calabasas
Banksta clowns, Timmy C wrapped in a shroud
Shrapnel in a sound cloud, body armor powwow
No ifs  no whats no whos no hows
Support the crazy horse, we need you now

[Chorus 2]
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up
Had enough, had enough, had enough, what the fuck?

[Break]

[Outro]
Hands up, hands up, hands up, come on
Had enough, had enough, what the fuck?
Hands up, hands up, hands up, come on
Had enough, had enough, what the fuck?
Hands up, hands up, hands up, come on
Had enough, had enough, what the fuck?
Hands up, hands up, hands up, come on
Had enough, had enough, what the fuck?
