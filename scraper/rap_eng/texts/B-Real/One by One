[Hook: Demrick]

One by one, watch 'em all fall down
Shots go off and the cops come round
No, nobody safe, no, nobody safe
No pass, it'll be your ass round here

To whom it may concern
We pour liquor on the curb
For our homies dead and gone
We gon' keep on holding on, nobody safe


[Verse 1: Demrick]

Adilly, dilly and my homies out in Philly
Know a nigga really, really got some problems
And she said she wanna blow it like the Phillies
Grab some Hennessy, some Kush and some condoms
And hit her spot up, but she live a couple blocks up
Where shit get crazy like a Psycho Realm concert
Where you could get shot up, when the wrong shit get brought up
Any kind of narcotic getting bought up
Not a question, will I go there
But you gon' need a pistol when you roll there
'cause shit come out of nowhere
Niggas don't fight fair, Obama's nightmare
Ghetto, black youth, dirty like a black tooth
B-Real and Adil rolling in that black coup
Told 'em swoop with my crew, ain't shit that I can't do
And you better relax, I can see back
Before we snap and relapse 'cause don't nobody need that
Believe that

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]

Brown paper bags and zig zags
Light up anywhere, middle finger in the air when the pigs pass
One hand palming the big ass, got cash money coming in
While the government thinks I'm mid-class
Street hustle always a slip past
That's why I'm in the underground, homie, where we're moving the brick, glass
I'm knee deep, fuck it, I live fast
But I can't turn back now, sudden moves always give whiplash
Everyone knows killers that'd murder you quick
On the other side of the world, never heard of your click
But they heard of mine, the army of the masked men, Sick
On the run, move from city to city, blurred by the fifth (sh!)
Pico-Union fugitives are used to this
Hiding out in Dubai, Dubai with Osama
Crime got it's own honor
You don't gotta ask, it's already known, I'm a psycho
Trynna make it to be an inked up old timer


[Hook: Demrick]

One by one, watch 'em all fall down
Shots go off and the cops come round
No, nobody safe, no, nobody safe
No pass, it'll be your ass round here

To whom it may concern
We pour liquor on the curb
For our homies dead and gone
We gon' keep on holding on, nobody safe


[Verse 3: Adil Omar]

One by one, watch 'em all fall down
Bada bing, bada boom, the god came to town
Egos clash and the heat goes blast
Just another bunch of pussies that my peep's gon' smash
We steady stuck in position, rolling deep, it's a juxtaposition
Whether we black, white, or brown, we still hungry and killing
Feasting on the flesh of lesser beings; lunch and for dinner
Veins pump liquid ice, cold as Murree in winter
The snow leopard: we the prototype of a dying breed
Try to speak, witness hell's cypher in a violent streak
Fuck your set, I'm from a place where the drama lives
Raised in a city, just an hour from Osama's crib
I've shed light, and I've painted the pictures
Seen humanity collapsing in the name of religion
Sick Jacken on the track, murder rappers, it's a righteous kill
Young De, Sick Side, Soul Assassins, Cypress Hill

[Verse 4: B-Real]

I spit one shot, two shot, three shot, four
And I still got ten more to put you on the floor
You can't afford the horde, who be knocking on your door
To swing a sword, have you on your path to the lord
We offer awards for weak bitches and snitches and time glitches
We dig ditches, throw you in it and you shit your briches
So as a pitcher pitches, I'm throwing some heat, you miss it
A struggle to realize, your stupid ass is on our hit list
You know the flow is endless and you could pretend you're shining
We still get shine like a jewel thief stealing diamonds
You got no time, and no rhyme and no reason
I'm thinking it's end game, try again next season
That's if you're still breathing and not bleeding
I'll be proceeding to keep eating pussies like you each meeting
Please remain seated, know death? - you can't beat it
You can cheat it once in a while, but you're deleted
Repeat it


[Hook: Demrick]

One by one, watch 'em all fall down
Shots go off and the cops come round
No, nobody safe, no, nobody safe
No pass, it'll be your ass round here

To whom it may concern
We pour liquor on the curb
For our homies dead and gone
We gon' keep on holding on, nobody safe
