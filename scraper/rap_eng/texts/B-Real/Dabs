[Pre-hook: B-Real] x4
Wax up, wax up
Smoking 'til I pass out

[Hook: B-Real] x4
Take one hit of this dab
Take one hit of this dab, uh

[Verse 1: B-Real]
What you smoking on?
Put one hit on that nail
It's like you floating on
Calm down, we just set sail
They call me glob monster
Take one hit I won't cough
It's Mr. Miyagi baby
We dumb wax on, wax off
That shatter is dripping
Living higher than most
We won't come down
My wax is the fire
The fire that burns these
Ricky motherfuckers to the ground
Got that hardcore
And that pure on my menu
Got another bunch up
Do another dab
Now we smoke up the venue

[Pre-hook: B-Real] x4
Wax up, wax up
Smoking 'til I pass out

[Hook: B-Real] x4
Take one hit of this dab
Take one hit of this dab, uh

[Verse 2: B-Real]
I've got a slab on it
You begging me give you a taste
I'm in my lab onto dabbing, get out my face
I grip my dabuccino Greenthumb edition
I take me a fat hit, mindstate lost my vision
I'm so fucking high I'm riding on a satellite
I'm looking down at the world
You can't reach my height
We can teach your type
How to hit that rig
How to get that right
Now we hit that big
Now we take that flight
Flower man and we bake all night

[Pre-hook: B-Real] x4
Wax up, wax up
Smoking 'til I pass out

[Hook: B-Real] x4
Take one hit of this dab
Take one hit of this dab, uh

[Verse 3: Dizzy Wright]
(Better take the dab and stop being a little pussy)
Take one hit of this ninja dab
Wax out layups toss-up
Walk-ups can't handle our
The smoke in they chest by the way they cough up
Don't try to hang with the boys
You not ready for that punch to the chest
Dizzy Wright with the Dr. Greenthumb
You know we had to come up with one for the West
Who's smoking 'til they get stoned?
Who smoke like us and make plans?
High as fuck with hella fans
Shaking hands, them amateurs they can't stand
Hit the rig then hit the stage
What's that?
Wax out, wax out, wax out
Theme song, stoners turn to King Kong
Every time they bring this track out
Dab got me in the zone
The hippie finna stack a thousand
Chinky-eyed with B-Real
I'm smoking Paris OG with the wax around it
That shit that put you on your ass
DJ Hoppa put me on the glass
Now we tour the planet, all organic
We still getting high
But we doing it fast
So I told the big homie

[Pre-hook: B-Real] x4
Wax up, wax up
Smoking 'til I pass out

[Hook: B-Real] x4
Take one hit of this dab
Take one hit of this dab, uh
