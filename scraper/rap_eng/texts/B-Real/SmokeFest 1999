[Tash]
Smoke this blunt
Yo, everybody grab a seat, welcome to SmokeFest '99
I'm glad you all could make it
As you can see, admission was free to SmokeFest this year
All the weed you see is free
But the blunts cost sixty bucks baby (Sixty bucks??!!)

[Verse 1: Tash]
CaTashTraphe, I shoot it through, dipped in 24 karats
If y'all niggas don't feel me, then I blame it on your parents
'Cause Tash fuck it up, don't twist it up wit' luck
My style is cold like I bought it off the ice cream truck
Listen here, Tash be crashin' niggas wit' my beer
Tash be partied down as fuck swingin' off the chandelier
Tash be here, Tash be there, Tash be everywhere it's poppin'
I'm here to let you know fuckin' wit' me's not an option
'Cause Tash is my name, Tash'll start it wit a bang
Tash'll end it wit a *gun shots* that's not the same thing
Tash'll split your frame, Tash swings like gold chains
I be rollin' wit King Tee, and we all in the same gang
But enough about CaTash, let's talk about some skrill
You know it's 'bout to pop if Likwit Crew is on the bill
You can ask my nigga Phil how real this is, the weed
SmokeFest '99, burn something to the beat

*Tash in background*
Damn man, y'all came all the way from where, man?
"All the way from Mobile, Alabama."
Oh yeah, you came to smoke some blunt?
"Yessir, we came to smoke some blunts wit' you, baby."

Smoke, SmokeFest time

[Verse 2: Big Boi]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I was lookin' to get my skull blowed up like Kid Dynamtie
The time is right
Be ridin' the track so fiercely that it seems I'm already high tonight
But I'm not though, I'm just on them Black & Mild ones
And people think that I'm the wild one
'Cause I be flippin' and rippin' the track
And verbally attackin' on your style for fun
Higher soul but to please myself I gotta be composin' that fire shit
And you notifying Tha Alkaholiks daily
So pump one 'fore you better dump, bitch
With a d-boy, rap, so some my boys are still in the trap
I mean, the dope spot
But the slangin' got my snappin' like the rope hot
I can be the player you wanna bust wit'
Or nigga you don't even wanna go fuck wit'
Or nup wit, you suck dick
So why you all up on my nuts? Quit
I hold the microphone and that's wit' a vice grip
Really tightly, and I'm keepin' the words crystal clear
So you gon' correct when you try to bite thee
Very nicely, Aquemini, my nigga, not a Pisces
But I'm likely, gon' fetch a sack of that green stuff
While I write G, yeah, yeah, right

[Verse 3: Andr√© 3000]
Yeah, peep this out yeah
Hard like, now picture this
A nigga in jail, rappin' while his folk in the next cell
Tappin' wit some spoons
We do rank the boom boom
Fresh off a planet wit sand dunes and maroon moons
Soakin' wet wounds, titty tanglin' tunes
Musty underarms, soul slum charm
Bump off in the drum, rhythm on the one
Stankonians under-smellin' where I'm comin' from, son
The day you bone is when you start to die
The time in between us will mean the most, I toast my high
See, shit gets so bad, I know it make you wanna cry
But suck it up, button up, go ahead and do your thing
Folk, I'm already high

Smoke, SmokeFest time

[Verse 4: Phil The Agony]
Yo, yo, yo
Whenever I'm writing, you can call me Philly Titan
Reciting to you an interview like Phil Donahue
Me and my crew, translate Los Angeles
Scandalous, like Watergate
Phil on the break, Phil on the break
Phil/fill in the blank, it feels bad like gettin' shanked
File up your taxes, I'm writin' exact on my axis
From my head down to my Air Max's
Phil waxes and relaxes
Phil also fills up mental food up in your picnic baskets
My name is Jason when I fill out my application
To the nation, niggas is gonna get in filled what they facin'
Phil/feel the ration, Phil/feel the adrenaline
I penetrate like penicillin, niggas be like "Phil is illin!"
Phil is willin' and ready
Phil is Raw like Eddie
Phil be cuttin' up like machetes and confetti
Deadly, Phil/feel the pain when I walk through the rain
Niggas be like "He sayin' Phil again, Phil again, Phil again"

Smoke, SmokeFest time

[Interlude: Tash]
Hey, hey, hey
Peace rap world, I'd like to make a special announcement right about now
We have a special guest that just stepped in the house
You know this man, he the smokiest cat in rap music
He goes by the name of the Doctor Greenthumb
Smoke 'em out

[Verse 5: B-Real]
Now I be, rollin' and smokin'
And holdin' the golden sack
When my lungs be gettin' swollen, hittin' the bong, rollin'
For chronic ironic, growin' the hydroponic
We got it, robotic hits you on melodic tricks of sonic
SmokeFest, expandin' your chest, Buddah bless, best
For you to step back 'cause your lyrics are like cess weed
Yes indeed, the session you need to retrieve it
It's ten niggas in a circle smokin' a spliff, believe it
Retrieve it, over the counter, can you conceive it
I give you Doctor Greenthumb digits, don't repeat it
The Brew Crew and the Buddah Masters together
Gettin' you higher and fuckin' you up that much faster
Zig zags, blunt leafs, pipes and bong-bowls
All be gettin' smoked at the Buddah head shows
Excuse me if it seems too complicated
The herb I hold is platinum while yours is nickel plated
Let me mash out, I'm breakin' the stash out, the hash out
I roll into the studio to smoke my nigga Tash out
With that Doctor Greenthumb shit, know what I mean?

Smoke, SmokeFest time
