[Pre-hook: Sick Jacken]
We came to drop these styles; It's no shock
We rock 'til the cops come and knock non-stop
We come from Psycho Cities and Blocks
We're raised by gunshots, low life in hip hop

[Verse 1: Big Duke]
Despite the rules, I choose to be one of the chosen few
Leavin' you confused, dazed and what got you all amazed
How the fuck we could be so blazed?
It takes one block to fill your life with terror
Think of all your bullet holes embedded in your area
Bullet, bullets and at the end, who gets shot
By mothafuckas making hip hop?

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
We came here to get you high, represent underdogs world-wide
On the hustle leading crooked lives
We don't die, we multiply; but we divide
So how are we gonna survive?
You got your role, I got mine; don't cross paths
Cause an intersection's just another form of clash, we crash

[Verse 3: Big Duke]
Due to violent environments, crimes terrorize rhyme events
I'm bringing the streets to the stage, rockin' them both and your front page
L.A. street families are crumblin', weak legacy
There must be some kind of way out of this pain
Said the joker, chain smokin', weed train
Take aim, stop random cappin', shoot a hootah captain

[Hook: Sick Jacken & Big Duke]
We came to drop these styles, it's no shock
We rock 'til the cops come and knock non-stop
Do you rock or do you get locked in fights with Glocks?
The Psycho Realm's spraying out your box
We come from psycho cities and blocks
We're raised by gunshots and low life in hip-hop
Do you rock or do you get locked in fights with Glocks?
The Psycho Realm's spraying out your box

[Verse 4: Sick Jacken]
Will spirits dancing in the flesh accept
When somebody changes the music and the tune is death
We don't dance around bonfires
We get stoned, tripped or wired
In memory of those expired
My people's exodus results in prejudice
You ask us why, in poverty, we become terrorists
Now let me tell you this: we don't choose to tote gats
And sellin' on the corner is to avoid tax
If you gun talk or hip-hop, there's too much division
So find a new mission or it'll stop
We do our thing, talk slang, live on fast lanes
Some do it for money, and others for the fame
You're out playin' games, dangerous with my aim
How long will you maintain before you get slain?

[Verse 5: Big Duke]
Clear in the mind but my soul is mad
Tendency to act real bad
Come across me, don't C-O-M-E out at N-I-G-H-T
Yeah, we the fuckin' crazy, youth from the streets freely
You see me, Pel√≥n Psyclone deliverin' a metal rainstorm

[Hook]
