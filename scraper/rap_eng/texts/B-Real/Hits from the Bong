[Intro: B-Real]
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Pick it, pack it, fire it up, come along
And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down just for a second
Don’t get me wrong it’s not a new method
Inhale, exhale
Just got a ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double barrel bong is gettin’ me stoned
Home skillet, there’s water inside don’t spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet, still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky funky smelly green shit
Sing my song, puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong

[Chorus]
Hits from the bong y’all
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Let’s smoke that bowl, hit the bong
And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it, unplug it, don’t strain
I love you Mary Jane
She never complains, when I hit Mary
With that flame, I light up the cherry
She’s so good to me
When I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don’t get me stirred up the smoke, through the bub-bling
Water is makin’ it pure so I got ta’
Take my hit and hold it, just like
Chong, I hit the bowl and I reload it
Get my four-footer and bring it on
As I take hits from the bong

[Chorus]
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a hit?

[Outro]
This shit’ll straighten your dick out
Can I get a hit?
