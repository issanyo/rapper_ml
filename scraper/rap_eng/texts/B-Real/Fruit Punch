[Intro: Brevi]
Momma didn't raise no dummy
Gimme all you want, can't take nothin' from me
Big Bad Wolf tryna catch a lil' bunny
Learned a long time ago the bears need honey

[Chorus: Brevi]
I'm zoned out, I'm fired up, I don't think I'm high enough
I took two, got five left, I'm out of touch, I digress
I truly don't give a fuck, 'cause I'm ice cold, no love
I'm turned off, know too much, no honeymoon, no fruit punch
Can't stand no crooked man, I can't stand no bitch
Keep your issues, keep your distance, I got money to collect
If you come from where I come from
You know how we represent
Get the bag, get the bullets, get the vest, fuckin' yes

[Verse 1: Xzibit & James Savage]
Comin' outside on you niggas
I'ma west ride on you niggas
I'ma get the OG's and the Bee Gees
Better find a place to hide, 'cause we killas
In my habitat with gorillas
We could take it to the back, I should kill 'em
Nah, let me handle that, let me get 'em
Nigga, we can lock up like the system
You could call the police like a victim
You a First 48 type of nigga, hit 'em
Them tear ducts all teared up
Didn't hesitate to tell on them niggas
Take a break, it's only gon' get 'em
If a mother fucker fake, he gon' get Godzilla
It's that pull-up, that bang-bang, we serial killers so we kill 'em

[Chorus: Brevi]
I'm zoned out, I'm fired up, I don't think I'm high enough
I took two, got five left, I'm out of touch, I digress
I truly don't give a fuck, 'cause I'm ice cold, no love
I'm turned off, know too much, no honeymoon, no fruit punch
Can't stand no crooked man, I can't stand no bitch
Keep your issues, keep your distance, I got money to collect
If you come from where I come from
You know how we represent
Get the bag, get the bullets, get the vest, fuckin' yes

[Verse 2: Demrick & B-Real]
Today, I got time for you niggas
I'ma bottom line all you niggas
I'm about mine, every single dime
Goes to the money and the women
I know you assumed you was winnin'
I'm immune to your venom
Pulled a nine from out the denim
Ride a hit of good vodka and send God to get 'em
Never lookin' back, I move ahead (Yeah)
Got another pack to move instead (Yeah)
Livin' like a king, we get the bread (Yeah)
Get away from me, we take your head (Yeah)
We don't leave a clue, no residue (Yeah)
Better have a few roll in with you (Yeah)
In the four door with the four-four
Goin' slow-mo, cocked and aimed at you

[Chorus: Brevi]
I'm zoned out, I'm fired up, I don't think I'm high enough
I took two, got five left, I'm out of touch, I digress
I truly don't give a fuck, 'cause I'm ice cold, no love
I'm turned off, know too much, no honeymoon, no fruit punch
Can't stand no crooked man, I can't stand no bitch
Keep your issues, keep your distance, I got money to collect
If you come from where I come from
You know how we represent
Get the bag, get the bullets, get the vest, fuckin' yes
