[Intro]
B-levators

[Verse 1: Berner]
Man, this shit got a crazy taste
I'm out of state, lettin' pounds go for 38
On my waist keep a 38, my Benz look clean
Talkin' money on my phone, what I heard today (Shit)
30k, another 20k, 50, A 100k
My bitch on the road strippin' (Damn)
Real Kush taste good, yeah, jet fuel
Do they still got money on my head still
Fuck 'em, keep pushing let the bullshit slide
Light two more joints up, enjoy my high
Big Dane never pulled trees fresh off the branch
I'm in my house shoes chillin', just watering plants (Urban Farmer)
New strains, yeah, Kenji call it Samurai
Wax drippin' down the joint like the candle light
They wanna smoke out with Bern, but that bag is light
I came up in the streets movin' bags of white (Cocaine)
Four words, don't blow my high
Ride slow while I light good weed on fire
This a motherfuckin' Hempire
Shit, I made 2 mill off of Hemp Water (Damn)

[Hook: Berner & B-Real]
New Benz, big body with the big wheels
Real Kush taste good, yeah jet fuel
They wanna know how the kings of the hemp feel
Celebrating one, you can pull 10 mil
550 snow white whipping through the city
Cali kings got them queens looking real pretty
Turf something throwing money like I'm P-Diddy
Call the doctor when you think you need to get with me

[Verse 2: B-Real]
Clouds forming in the sky from my exhale
Out the window of the S-class, smoke trail
Pied piper hit your dab rig in the cypher
Spilling wax on the e-nail, get you higher
Still hit the flower like a 22 time batter champion
Lemon tree in my paper, Mary my companion
Up in Cali, got the levels at a higher standard
Mary some richer bitch, you rookies wouldn't understand them
She be rolling with the bosses, that's the end of story
With the rack of riches state to state, running for me
Sherbet chilling on the sunset, caught my eye
Flying high on the jet fuel and cherry pie
Cali treasure, not even Jack Sparrow had it
You can smell the flavor, one word, aromatic
Berner and Green Thumb, such a hard act to follow
Stacking paper mile high, Colorado

[Hook: Berner & B-Real]
New Benz, big body with the big wheels
Real Kush taste good, yeah jet fuel
They wanna know how the kings of the hemp feel
Celebrating one, you can pull 10 mil
550 snow white whipping through the city
Cali kings got them queens looking real pretty
Turf something throwing money like I'm P-Diddy
Call the doctor when you think you need to get with me
