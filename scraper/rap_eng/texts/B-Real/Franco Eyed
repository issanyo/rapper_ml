[Verse 1: Duddy B]
I'm on that overload, overkill
I'm redlinin' on blue pills
High octane's my intake
I'm P-Swayze, man, Point Break
Make no mistakes, I don't care
Not one shit will be given here
Make the room shake, earthquake
Turbulence, outer space
Yeah, let it go, cruise control
Full speed ahead with my eyes closed
I smoke the best, yes hydro
Makes my eyes red like Diablo
I'm taking off, next to go
Molotov, set to blow
These crimson eyes are set to glow
Medieval shit, man, crossbows
We dangerous, beast mode
Got catapults full of bags of dope
Man, set in stone, good to go
Found my zone in the Alamo
Yeah big time, dinosaur
So big, colossal
You stuck in dirt, man, fossils
We taking off, full throttle, let's go

[Chorus]
Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco-eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing

[Verse 2: Dirty J]
Okay, get it, got it, get it, good
Like a big bad wolf when you're lost in the woods
Put teeth in the beat like it's rocking a hood
Wear the clothes of a sheep and I wish you would
Try to find me like you wish you could
Roll real deep, and it's understood
We getting real fucked up and I'm feeling real good
Gotta Carrie me home, Underwood
I'm nice on the mic like a knife to the throat
The night's real high 'cause the bass real low
Right by your side when you fight with a bloke
Watch where you bite 'cause you might just choke
Dead man walking, end of the rope
If I hear this one more time then I might just blow:
"You're a Dirty Head, you're filthy bro"
Fuck it then, someone give me the soap
Mopping the floor with ya
Break down the door to rock the performance
Top of the morn' to ya
Awkwardly orbit the top of the score like friends in the core
Man, I'll go to war for ya
These crazy lights, these hazy nights, I'm Franco-eyed
Got me yelling at the sky like

[Chorus]
Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco-eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing
Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco-eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Inhale then exhale
Clear the bong, no stale smoke
Lungs open like a ship sail
Mutiny when you double-toke
My boot hits like a drum kick
No two shits do I give a fuck
My crew's thick like a fat bitch
And she's hungry fool, get eaten up
You're a steppin' stone, we walkin' tall
Footprints down the hall
Knocked down, we stand up
We party hard, get ya hands up
We blaze up, smoke you out
Mind trap, we broke you out
There's an undertone, don't hesitate
We love Cali, we medicate
In my zone it's sucka-free
And you're the bitch it sucks to be
When the doctor's in it's about y'all
Remember this, no house calls
My doors are open with a nurse waitin
Sexy bitch bring in my first patient
Heart racin', paper chasin'
I'm Bruce Wayne and you're Dick Grayson

[Chorus]
Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing
Yelling at the sky singing
Rolling Franco eyed singing
Yelling at the sky singing
