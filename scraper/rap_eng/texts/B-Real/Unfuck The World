[Chorus: Chuck D, B-Real x2]
No hatred, fuck racists
Blank faces, time's changin'
One nation, unification
The vibration, unfuck the world!

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Poverty hit home like a war zone
Check America's pulse, heard a death tone
Division hittin' like a bullet to precision
Kill the dream, kill the vision, now listen
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Stand up and rise like the tide
And move your ass with the quickness
You may live on the hit list
No fear, bare witness
Where's ya heart at the heartless can't say
Bow down, just do what the man say
Buy them lie them deny it all day
In a box they locked in the dead lay
Bombs droppin on cities where kids play
Soldiers fallin in the name of freedom hey
Civilians buried in the rubble where dreams die
Politicians spew lie after fuckin lie

[Chorus: Chuck D, B-Real x2]
No hatred, fuck racists
Blank faces, time's changin'
One nation, unification
The vibration, unfuck the world!

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Hatred lies divided people
Gorgeous anger deeds of evil
After the fall whom the bell calls
Like we all dancing In a ballroom without balls
Talk-walk look out listen
2020 see now
Currency is attention
Fascism too many cooks in the kitchen
Exploding phones
Killing drones on a mission
I'm elated to get y'all elevated
God remains God yeah and they hate it
On your knees people
Pledge allegiance to the evil
Everything changed yet nothing's changed
Bold is change, everything looking strange, yeah
Engineers got millennials livin' in fear
Give a damn, evil can't stand, yeah
When the people take a stand
C'mon!

[Chorus: Chuck D, B-Real x2]
No hatred, fuck racists
Blank faces, time's changin'
One nation, unification
The vibration, unfuck the world!

[Bridge: Chuck D]
Unfuck the world!
Unfuck the world!
Unfuck the world!
Unfuck the world!

[Outro: B-Real]
I'm the straw that broke the camel's back
The gun in the car jack
The night stick that keeps crackin' down
The resistance never backing down
