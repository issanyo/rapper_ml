[B-Real]
Who wants the wrath, it must be the hood
Who's up to no good, and wishes a man would
Come up and give him a reason to blast him...
I wouldn't put it past him!
He's got juice, how long will it last him?
He's gettin back, at all the punks that harassed him
Ask him (hey!) what's ya main hobby?
He'll say there ain't, nothin' like the motherfuckin robbery
So don't crowd me, cause yo I run shit
You know, homey that old top gun shit
I got a slug comin' straight out the barrel
For your ass, if you wanna ask a dumb question
Cause I'm quick on the draw, click-click, punks drop
Now your lives ain't worth shit!

Chorus: B-Real, Sen Dog (repeat 2X)

Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up y'all, yeah
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up (SHOOT 'EM UP!)
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up y'all, yeah
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up (SHOOT 'EM UP!)

[Sen Dog]
Sen Dog, never again will I bend
No letters of death, no threats, will I send
So I'm puttin an end, to all your dumb shit
(dumb shit) dumb shit.. that, "Holmes where you from?" shit
Cause I run shit, my way, all day, I don't play
Cause it won't pay
Niggas wanna play with the pistol, you make me get pissed though
(YOU GET A FISTFUL!)
Make you eat knuckles, feel your knees buckle
Still feelin great when you're sleepin on the pavement?
Save it! The beatdown, who gave it?
Senen, no more explainin'

Chorus

[B-Real]
I've had it up to here with all the bullshit
Finger's on the trigger and I'm about to pull it
Gank hardrock, up the block, you know I rule it
To the punks around the corner someone's gonna catch a bullet
To the crew that wants to get with my program
I'm out to get mine and ain't takin' shit from no man
In the neighborhood cause there ain't no brotherhood
In other words good if you heard that we're comin' up
We're out to make a quick buck, that's what I'm thinkin'
And I'm smokin' any punk who even thinks of finkin

Chorus
