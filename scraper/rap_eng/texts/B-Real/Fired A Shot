Uh, yeah
Come on

When i walk around, people stare me down
Don't make a sound, i stand my ground
I fight back (Fight back)
And it's like that ('Cause it's like that)

Look who fired the shot
I just fired the shot
We fired the shot
Look who fired the shot
Look who fired the shot
I just fired the shot
We fired the shot
Look who fired the shot

Yeah, it's like that (It's like that)
It's like that, uh

To protect and serve, a full time reserve
Hooker took the curb, workin' up the nerve
To fight back (Uh)
'Cause it's like that (Yeah, it's like that)

I will grow my herb, you better spread the word
Don't' matter what you heard, this whole thing's absurd
Let's fight back (Fight back)
'Cause it's like that (Yeah, it's like that, come on)

Look who fired the shot
I just fired the shot
We fired the shot
Look who fired the shot
Look who fired the shot
I just fired the shot
We fired the shot
Look who fired the shot

And it's like that
And it's like that
And it's like that
Fire

Look who fired the shot
I just fired the shot
We fired the shot
Look who fired the shot
Look who fired the shot
I just fired the shot
We fired the shot
Look who fired the shot
