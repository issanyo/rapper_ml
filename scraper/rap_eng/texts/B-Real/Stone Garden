[Intro: Big Duke]
This jam right here is dedicated
To all you mothafuckas that ain't right here
You're supposed to be right here with me, mothafucka
You know what I'm saying?
You know what the fuck I'm saying
I'll catch up with you soon, holmes
Haha, yeah, we'll catch up to you all, all of you mothafuckas
You know what I'm saying
Cause at the end, at the end we all diiiie

[Verse 1: Sick Jacken]
Sounds like Gods are crying tears of Malathion
Raining over your head to put out the fire
Who desires to die? besides the suicidal
Tendencies can lead to the eternal sleep
So keep you eyes wide, open and alive
Grab your snake and ride to the other side
If your intention is to defy death
I'll tell you now, even the best get laid to rest
We're on our way to the Stone Garden
End of the road where everybody goes but not forgotten
Frames all rotten, souls travel to unravel
Other worlds and big cloud castles
Why do we have these hassles, livin' cautious?
Walking the street, watching your back
Your fear's collosus
We conjure souls while ganja rolls
Everybody here's high so the story unfolds
We're on another plane of thought, thinkin' immortal
But the path we're on leads us straight to the portal

[Hook: Big Duke & Sick Jacken]
(Devils in disguise)
They're coming to claim us
Let it come as no surprise
I stare into the face of death
Cause at the end of their time, everybody dies

[Verse 2: Big Duke]
This is the time of pain
Warzone for your own gain
I roam the middle with the metal cause I'm insane
Break frames, catch a smokin'
Is it gonna earn you a name?
Did you get slain?
Or fall victim to bald knuckle heads and bad aim
It ends all the same
Every mothafucka right here gotta jump a soul train
Some go up, some go south
Some get stuck in a realm with no way out
Some get to ride, O.D. on drug hits
Dying in your sleep, that's the shit
But lives get took violently on the streets of a lost city

[Hook: Big Duke (x2)]

[Verse 3: B-Real]
In the Stone Garden, we keep all the heavenly gates packed
With fresh souls under control, no holdin' back
Look at all these names engraved in the stones
Even the unknown finds his path on his way home
Roam where the spirits all lie
One of these fuckin' days, even I'm gonna die
And when I do, I'll be another memory
Hangin' out with the ones who were there before me
Look out, let me set your soul free
By the Buddha tree, open the gates to eternity
Everybody rise up, open up your eyes
We demise and we're trippin' to the other side

[Hook: B-Real (x2)]

[Outro: Big Duke]
Yeah at the end, at the end we'll catch up with you
You know what I'm saying, ese
We all die then mothafucka
Yeah, even if you take me out right now
One of my mothafuckas gonna take you out
And then you'll take him and back and forth and shit
And it don't stop, you know what I'm saying?
Body rot, drop and shit
You know what I mean, haha
This is the end!
