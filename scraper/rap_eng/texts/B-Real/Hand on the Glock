[Verse 1: B-Real]
Crusing through the neighborhood, some say I'm no good
Claiming I'm a criminal but lets make it understood
I'm just one man with a whole lot of homeboys
You get the click and a pop when I pull out the chrome toy
Jack me and I'll jack you back
Then jump back to my big Buddah like
I'm not a bad guy but don't take advantage
I'm throwing out the garbage just show me where the can is
All I was doing was searching for the boom
Then some punk tried to hit me with the broom
Lucky I ducked quick or else I'd be assed out
Last thing I wanted was have to pull the gat out
Here comes a nigga and he's got a .38
Well like Grandma said, hey yo I'm shooting up straight

[Hook]
Cause I put away the shotgun bought me a Glock
Took a liitle trip to the funky weed spot
Tried to jack me but homie got shot
La-la-la-lalala-la!

[Verse 2: Sen Dog]
Couple niggas from the east side fucking up your program
No one witnessed but they heard the gun blast
Left the problem unsolved now I'm gonna sum up
How people getting hurt in the process of the come up
Gotta get with fools that'll wait for you to run up
Rolling in the hood that you already shot up
Pocket full of gats and see if we can spot the
One we let slip in the process of the tip
When we find his ass, gonna unload the clip
Then take a little trip down to Rio
Now my hood's hot so I got to go chill

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Kicking that funky Cypress Hill shit
Think I'll load a clip, let's see if you can deal with
Cause a bulletproof vest ain't shit
When the infrared's pointing at your head kid
And that's just too bad y'all
Now I'm headed up a river with a boat and no paddle
Should've put the Glock down
Now they got me in lock down
Living like a nigga that done lost his mind
Cause self defense turns to the offense
But nobody even really knows that
All they see is me and the gat
Up in the court room looking at the jury
Starin down the punk ass District Attourney
La-la-la-la-lala-la!
Verdict's in and I'm guilty as charged

[Hook]
