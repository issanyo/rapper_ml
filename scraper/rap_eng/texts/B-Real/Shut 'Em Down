[B-Real:]
Going down the cross roads, feeling kinda lost no
Way to make it forsaken and taken for a lost soul!
I don't want your sympathy! - I don't need your hand out!
Never had it planned out, just a cut your man out!
Wars on the newscast! - Caught it on a news flash!
Heard about a new tax! - What if I refuse that?
I don't want your promises! - I don't need your bullshit!
I don't need you telling me the answers at the pulpit!
Setup for the meltdown! - Hunted by the hellhounds!
Spiders got you spellbound! - Get up if you fell down!
I don't hate your slick talk! - I don't seek your point of view!
I'm the fucking thorn your side that keeps annoying you!
