[Verse 1: B-Real]
I'm on a rampage! Rippin' up the damn stage
Wartime fate Dealer, some say renegade
Part-time psycho! - Sippin' on lemonade
Don't want trouble but I'll give it to you anyway
Yes, I'm insane! Put you in pain
My mind has been trained to live in the fastlane!
Should I slow down? - Fuckin' speed up!
You better take a hit from my weed you need some! [3 seconds guitar solo by Daron Malakian]

[Bridge: B-Real]
Go hard, go hard! Live hard, die hard! [3 seconds guitar solo by Daron Malakian]
Rape one, cap one, fake one, slap one! [3 seconds guitar solo by Daron Malakian]
Break one, jack one, save one, get one! [3 seconds guitar solo by Daron Malakian]
"Rise up"! "Rise Up"! Take me higher!

[Hook 1: B-Real " (Sen Dog)]
Got my hands on the wheel
And I'm never lookin' back in my rearview mirror!
(I'm A TROUBLE SEEKER! - BUCK, BUCK! - I'm A TROUBLE SEEKER!)
Can't eat or sleep I need some
Medical attention, I'm a trouble seeker!
I'm a trouble seeker! - I'm a trouble seeker!
I'm a trouble seeker! - I'm a trouble seeker!

[Verse 2: Sen Dog]
Blowin' the chop', but I'm midnight stalker
The graveyard walker and I don't like coppers!
The mic linebacker - Elvis comin' at cha! (ELVIS COMIN' AT CHA!)
Middle of the pig, wanna pay off disaster!
Hide ya from Cypress! - All around hypin'!
Songs like these keep bringing up my prices. (BRINGIN' UP MY PRICES!)
Dog in the food in Bob Marley hold out
Balls to the wall on a date with a student!

[Bridge]

[Hook 2: B-Real + (Sen Dog)]
Got my hands on the wheel
And I'm never lookin' back in my rearview mirror!
(I'm a trouble seeker! - BUCK, BUCK! - I'm a trouble seeker!)
I don't care about them
And if you see me comin' actions are clear!
(I'm A TROUBLE SEEKER! - BUCK, BUCK! - I'm A TROUBLE SEEKER!)

They say I'm crazy, lately
I'm off the chains, don't touch me baby!
(I'm A TROUBLE SEEKER! - BUCK, BUCK! - I'm A TROUBLE SEEKER!)
Can't eat or sleep, I need some
Medical attention I'm a trouble seeker!
I'm a trouble seeker! (trouble...) - I'm a trouble seeker! (trouble...)
I'm a trouble seeker! (trouble...) - I'm a trouble seeker! (trouble...)

[Verse 3:]
[B-Real:]
Is that so? Listen in your headphones!
Carvin' up your headstone, guessin' you was dead wrong!
So up the heatwave! Betta learn to behave!
These days we pass weed. - Like a relay!
[Sen Dog:]
Sorta like a hand off, then you really handle
It; you puff up a hit, then you're lit like a candle!
We lead by example! - You know that we are showin' proof
Gonna beat them whose are over you beat down overdue!
[B-Real:]
Beat down owerdue. - Had to learn the hard way!
Homie started flippin' and we left them in the hallway!
Gonna puff all day! - Shut 'em down late night!
Motherfuckers wanna play! - What you got stage fright?
