[Hook]
I know that you high, I get you higher
Smoking weed until my lungs retire
You say you's a stoner, you's a liar
Light that paper up and start a fire
Start a fire (x4)
You say you's a stoner, you's a liar
Light that paper up and start a fire

Jet fuel, twisted up, watch the way we light this up (x4)

[Verse 1]
I'm holding them trees
They looking at me
When they look for a remedy
We set that tone, chasing that dream
Everything be essentially
Always moving
We can't stop what we doing
Product improving
Y'all can't do it
I run through it like a track star
Man I'm a shoo-in
That fire starter
That one with the jet fuel
Put you on cloud nine
When I spark in the crowd
I never leave until
Everybody have a loud time
That flower sweet
Wrap it up in a bite, girl
I don't need a blunt wrap
Greenthumb he stay in the streets
And I got strains
I don't ever have to make a comeback

[Hook]
I know that you high, I get you higher
Smoking weed until my lungs retire
You say you's a stoner, you's a liar
Light that paper up and start a fire
Start a fire (x4)
You say you's a stoner, you's a liar
Light that paper up and start a fire

Jet fuel, twisted up, watch the way we light this up (x4)

[Verse 2]
Don't play me too close
I'll give you that dose
When we grow, we the most professional
Checking your pulse
Watching you lust
On the weed we unconventional
We keep rolling
On that check that we holding
Pockets all swollen
Y'all be knowing
Of that shit we be growing
Everybody blowing
When you come for the doctor
Looking for the OG
Homie i'mma call away
You don't ever need a second opinion
I be hitting my shots since I fall away
They call me Greenthumb
But when I roll up
Then I become Dr. J
You hitting them joints
You hitting them blunts
And taking those puffs I say

[Hook]
I know that you high, I get you higher
Smoking weed until my lungs retire
You say you's a stoner, you's a liar
Light that paper up and start a fire
Start a fire (x4)
You say you's a stoner, you's a liar
Light that paper up and start a fire
