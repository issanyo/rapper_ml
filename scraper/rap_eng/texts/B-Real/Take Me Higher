[Intro: B-Real + Chuck D]
Yo, Chuck, is that a drone up there, man?
They fly over, they fly over
Let me go get Timmy C's gun and shoot it out the fuckin' sky
Look out when they all come down

[Chorus: Chuck D + B-Real]
Drones!
They got you tapped, they got your phone
Look out!
Drones!
They got ya trapped, they spot your home
'Cause you're a target
Drones!
They got you tapped, they got your phone
Look out, uh
Drones!
They got ya trapped, they spot your home
'Cause you're a target

[Verse 1:  B-Real]
Uh
I been one for years
I'm never in fear
Standin' up with my peers
Making these tears, rain down like a monsoon
Listen to the streets go boom
Explosion (Emotion)
Fight the power and
Over the fuckin' injustice I'm towerin'
Feds no props, when I drops these lyrics that'll make you say
"Fuck the cops!"

[Chorus: Chuck D + B-Real]
Drones!
They got you tapped, they got your phone
Look out!
Drones!
They got ya trapped, they spot your home
'Cause you're a target
Drones!
They got you tapped, they got your phone
Look out, uh
Drones!
They got ya trapped, they spot your home
'Cause you're a target

[Verse 2: Chuck D + B-Real]
Drones gonna take you out (Huh!)
Drones gonna shut your mouth (Huh!)
Drones flyin' checkin' y'all out (Huh!)
Drones in the hood like, "Wow" (Wow)
Comin' from the airport hangar (Hangar)
Hanging heads certified bangers (Bangers)
Branch of government gangsters (Uh!)
Programmed by government strangers (Uh!)

[Bridge: B-Real]
Take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher

[Break]

[Bridge: B-Real]
Take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher
Take me higher

[Chorus: Chuck D + B-Real]
Drones!
They got you tapped, they got your phone
Look out!
Drones!
They got ya trapped, they spot your home
'Cause you're a target
Drones!
They got you tapped, they got your phone
Look out, uh
Drones!
They got ya trapped, they spot your home
'Cause you're a target

[Outro: B-Real + Chuck D]
Drones gonna take you out, yeah
Drones gonna take you out, huh
Drones gonna take you out, uh
Drones in the hood like, "Wow," uh
