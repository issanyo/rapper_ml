(Jet fuel in the air)

[Hook] x2
Jet fuel in the air
Middle fingers everywhere
Hundred deep up in here, yeah
Fuck the haters, we don't care
It's the Mile High Club 'round here

[Verse 1]
As I fill up my papers
The haters catching the vapors
You know I'm holding the flavors
The neighbors smell it when I sell it
And the hype is major
People shell it, gotta have it
If you crossing the Vader
And when I give a prescription
Got you dabbing and hitting the kush
Sipping and shining we push
Harder than ever
For worse or for better
We in debt to rhyme, what put my family together
We on the jet fuel, pushing to the highest level
Call me Johannes Rebel
Smoking the finest devil
Call me Green Thumb, bitch
Remember mine forever
While you're high and we ain't coming down
No time is feather

[Hook] x2
Jet fuel in the air
Middle fingers everywhere
Hundred deep up in here, yeah
Fuck the haters, we don't care
It's the Mile High Club 'round here

[Verse 2]
I got your medication
See we lacing the nation
What we blaze is amazing
Stoner of the year here
I'm the dream that you chasing
If you take another hit
I know your heart be racing
See I be burning with Berner
Because me and Berner know
Mary's a very good earner
She can turn it up
And you can never get enough
You can never spend enough
You just wanna spend it up
And no room for hesitation
Cause if you wait
And people take your medication be gone
They say Green Thumb
Tell us why you waited so long
This ain't no pre-run homie
While we service the bong

[Hook] x2
Jet fuel in the air
Middle fingers everywhere
Hundred deep up in here, yeah
Fuck the haters, we don't care
It's the Mile High Club 'round here
