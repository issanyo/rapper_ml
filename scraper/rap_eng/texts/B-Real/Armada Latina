Ay Caribe el tierra del mi gente hermosa
(Armada Latina)
Cielo y Sol, me acompanan donde quiera
(mi fama hispana)
Hermanito la lucha recien que empieza
(hermano ponle gana)
Yo naci con sangre Taina, yo naci

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Came out the other man
Southern land
Didn't have an upper hand
Never had another plan
I'm different to them other men
Some will get a summer tan
It's hotter than a summer jam
Live for today
Cause you're never getting another chance
I ain't tripping off the he say and she say
Cause we say fuck
And pass me a cuba libre
That's what we want
Don't front
I could see ya but
You don't want to see the cold heap up front
How we blow it up
We came to blow it up, hit the spot
So we're done
Representin' in, blowin up
That's how we show the love
That's how we pass up all this shit that
We know gon' come
It's like the soldier's run is done when the war's won

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Pitbull]
Latino hasta la muerte
Chico stay working hard
Bout the noise
Suerte Gracias a Dios, Thank God
The Cubans from Miami coulda took that coke route
Marimberos balseros con clinicas
Santeros con muela
Que dicen que pueden curar abuelas
Ya'll like Scarface
I'm more like Sosa
Cypress hill pretty flaco
It's our culture
From Cali to the crib, crib
Me in miami
Thank god I'm doin music
If not I'd be tying families
I'm not a asshole(oh no)
About my cash flow
Let me take this shit
And send this letter off to Castro
Ha, ha, ha Dale, come mierda

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sen Dog]
We way too hot
Always coming up with something clever
La cosa nostra
Cypress Hill maca fera
Feeling fancy in the hip throne, guayabera
And we just clowning
On what we call some, money-lera
Call me Senny
Wild child from the isles
I can go forever like an old fashioned country mile
Stilo be guajiro
Latino is the lingo
I'm straight cubanichi
I bang Pinar del Rio
Lockin up this function
Just like Benny More
Go ahead and play the congas
And I'm gonna rap over it
Ya I'm a fool I'm outta here
Yes sir I gotta go
Get me some Chivas Regal
And slap me some dominos
