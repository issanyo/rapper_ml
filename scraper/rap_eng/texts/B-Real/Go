[Hook: Vital]
Let me go
Sit back and let me enjoy what I'm feelin' (High)
Let me go
Sit back and let me enjoy what I'm feelin' (High)

[Verse 1: Berner]
Really zonin', pills same color as the ocean (Baby blue)
Floating on a Kush cload, homie what you smokin'?
What I'm holdin', live resin, whole plant frozen (Wax)
Touch down, outta town, bust a pack open (Chi-town)
Wet towels, by the door, whole floor smell (Whole floor)
Two months, on a bump, I'm on tour still (Yeah)
Carbon filter, I'mma need some more Ona Gel (Kill the smell)
Burn a pound of some smoke that I grow myself (Bern lit)
Let me be, I'mma roll up more Lemon Trees
You smell that sweet, sticky smoke, you can tell that's me (Berner's shit)
Man, I be high, I'm in my own world
My phone ringin', I ain't thinking about ol'girl (Ol'girl)
I been chilling, yeah, time to unwind (Relax)
Go smoke, red wine, yeah, it's good for your mind
This a different kind of high
Let me go and get high on my own
I'm so stoned

[Hook: Vital]
Let me go
Sit back and let me enjoy what I'm feelin' (High)
Let me go
Sit back and let me enjoy what I'm feelin' (High)

[Bridge: Vital]
The days in full
And the nights are gone
So why would you be cruel
And not leave me alone
There's so much time to spend
And not enough for me
I got a life to live
And stress is what I don't need

[Hook: Vital]
Let me go
Sit back and let me enjoy what I'm feelin' (High)
Let me go
Sit back and let me enjoy what I'm feelin' (High)

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Seat up in the doctors office
We might be having a conference
Smoking it heavy, no non-sense
Rookies, they go unconscious
Those are consequences for losing you fucking senses
Capture it through your lenses
The need for it's driving you senseless
Spinning around like the shoes on my 550
Floating on a cloud cause loud's always here with me
I hate to sound repetitive but if you need a sedative
Call the doctor, I'm sympathetic with better shit
The most, Berner and I, we don't boast
But make a toast to the greatest and most high
Holy smokes, cookie comb, funky feel, massive pill
Big Berner, B-Real, if you will let it spill
Got the house up on the hill with big windows
Looking at the city as I'm blowing out the indo
That's a lot of info, zero fucks given
We keeps these ladies rising
That's just how we living

[Outro]
Let me go
Sit back and let me enjoy what I'm feelin' (High)
