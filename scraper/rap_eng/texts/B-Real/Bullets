[Verse 1: B-Real]
Lost dreams of innocence, long past
Through time, memories burn and fade like ash
In the crosswinds, through the crosshairs
Let the bullet strike
The Teflon and on and on and in
Feel me penatrate the skin
So I could travel, unravel the hole in your shell
I'm gonna send you straight to hell
Now your lifeless, God bless your soul and lay to rest
It's useless, I go through the west chest cavity area
Let them bury you shell deep in the earth
Where you dwell in your wooden cell

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
Gang insigina splits your familia
Let me break it down, mira
You're slayin' mothafuckas that look like you do
Dyin' off slowly is the only rule
In this rat race, crews choose paper chase
Almost always illegal, regals and bandidos
Government tactics pack this street with plastic
Dreams and fantasies of gettin' paid drastic
But most get blasted, all you fanatics
Out for cheese and G's, cease dramatics

[Hook: Big Duke]
In this chapter, we're gonna define
Why rivals die, bullets fly, they fill skies
And we die faster than we multiply

[Verse 3: Sick Jacken]
Bullets pierce through sky like a storm
You're warned and if it hails you die
Assassins passin' through your block, blastin' action
Dust gets kicked up in violent fashion
Trigger men get bigger than
Solitary cages through the age
As we've been taken for a ride by the other side
They split us up in cliques and pitch the homicide
They use, divide and conquer, the stronger will survive
Supply the guns and ammo, then watch the color die

[Verse 4: B-Real]
Bullets are on a mission
To search and destroy
No names attached, just convoys
Deployed on your team
You wanna scheme dreams of material vision
My squadron of 36 is on a mission
And I'm on you like flies on shit
And I got back up with 36 more in the clip
As I come to expand and change dimensions
My philosophy becomes high with bad intentions
It's a vengeance like bees to the hive
Strive to stay alive and live through the drive by

[Verse 5: Big Duke]
Who really remembers the blastin'?
Five minutes of crossfire, action
Two sides fight in the night
And thousands of nameless bullets fly by, aimless
In your direction, makin' rivals die on occasion
Yeah, enemies muthafucka, take in all of my steel, bleed
Hot metal get thrown away
On the streets of L.A. as I run away
In this chapter, we're gonna define
Why rivals die, bullets fly, they fill skies
And we die faster than we multiply
