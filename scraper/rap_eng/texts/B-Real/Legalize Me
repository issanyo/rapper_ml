[Verse 1: B-Real]
They smoke in Colorado
They smoke in Cali too
They smoked all night, but that's alright
We still fight on tomorrow
If you come down to SoCal
Roll one, maybe two
Fly to the Bay, come back to LA
We can medicate tomorrow

[Chorus: Chuck D, B-Real, Both]
Get free, get free, come on
Legalize me
Get free, get free, yeah
Legalize me
Get free, get free, huh
Legalize me
Legalize me, legalize me, yeah

[Verse 2: B-Real]
They smoke up in Toronto
They smoke in Portland too
We feel alright, all day and all night
But we fight on tomorrow

[Chorus: Chuck D, B-Real, Both]
Get free, get free, come on
Legalize me
Get free, get free, yeah
Legalize me
Get free, get free, huh
Legalize me
Legalize me, legalize me, get free

[Bridge: B-Real]
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!
Alright! Alright! Alright!

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
Young widows, candles lit
Teenagers blown to bits
Unfriendly radio hits
Prom nights at The Ritz
Loyalists, White House liars
Thinning ice, balding tires
Silver spoons, chicken pox
At midnight we turn back the clocks
Feel the burn, burn the fire
Make them all realize it
Open eyes to land and skies
Where violence is authorized
Turntables, apple pie
Cluster bombs, Kentucky Fried
Kill all the lights, out go the tide
Need a break, legalize

[Chorus: Chuck D, B-Real, Both]
Get free, get free, hey
Legalize me
Get free, get free, come on
Legalize me
Get free, get free, yeah
Legalize me
Legalize me, legalize me, get free

[Outro: Chuck D & B-Real]
Get free, get free, legalize
Get free, get free, legalize
Get free, get free, legalize
Get free, get free, get free
