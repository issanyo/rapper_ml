[Intro]

I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high
I want to get high, so high

[Verse: B-Real]
Well it's the funk elastic, the blunt I twist it
The slamafied, Buddha-fied funk on your discus
Oh, what you missed this, you got to bear witness
Catch a ho and another ho, Merry Christmas
Yes I smoke shit, straight off the roach clip
I roach it for the blunted ones to approach it
Forward motion, make you sway like the ocean
The herb is more than just a powerful potion
What's the commotion, yo I'm not joking around
People learning about, what they're smoking
My oven's on high, when I roast the quail
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale
Exhale, now you felt the funk of the thai
Wanna feel the effects...

I want to get high - so high!
I want to get high - so high!
I want to get high - so high!
I want to get high - so high!
Yo hits from the bong
Yo hits from the bong
Yo hits from the bong
Yo hits from the from the bong from the bong
Yo hits from the bong
Yo hits from the from the bong from the bong
Yo hits from the from the bong from the bong
