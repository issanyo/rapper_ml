I never let 'em see me sweatin, only money I'm gettin
I bet you're bettin I'm losin I'm refusin to give in
I don't follow nobody, I'm a leader so watch me
I think you're thinkin solutions but it's useless to stop me
Any hate that you send me, you won't break me or bend me
I'm out to get it I'll set it off on any who envy
Should you try to come at me, you ain't takin a penny
We hustlers hustle for dollars and we ballers got plenty
I see plotters and schemers, the suckers and dreamers
We heat the heaters you bleedin if we leavin the Beemers
We tryin to feed our family, tryin to hustle like Camby
Connections connect and we postin a poster with Brandy
You see poppers I'm poppin, but you don't see the coffin
I see you starin apparent that you're optin for options
I feel tragedy comin, humanity's buggin
You need to get it together if you plan to be somethin

[Hook 2X: Mimi]
I'm on the grind baby, I've got to go
I'm 'bout my hustle homey, I've got to show
I'm on a mission baby get that dough
And once I get it gotta get some mo'

[B-Real]
You take the game and its repercussions, all the money I'm touchin
Jackers jackin believe me if they see me they're rushin
So I gotta be fitted, yeah my heaters are hidden
Money's money it ain't funny you dummies won't get it
I dare you kids to follow, just know the tips are hollow
Protect your neck in a second you checkin out tomorrow
We on the corner grindin, turnin from coal to diamonds
Nothin from nothin we grindin design a place to shine and
It's a dream we livin, don't be hatin I'm driven
See what I see and you're learnin the reason why I'm winnin
You niggas cockroaches, you so braggadocious
You talkin rugged but you crumble when trouble approaches
Don't give the game to many, not meant for everybody
Dollar for dollar be humble and stumble out the party
Where the wolves are hungry, and they hungry for money
See what I'm sayin they ain't playin their mouths are bloody

[B-Real]
It's all about survival of the fittest, you can never be skittish
You hit, quit it, you leave it, in every crime committed
There's no room to be sloppy, ain't no need to be cocky
Get what you gettin the lesson is you need to get off me
Can you handle your own? Can you make your way home?
Metal for metal I'm pullin and refusin to settle
Some are payin the piper, I'm ignitin the fire
Higher and higher I'm movin and you're losin desire
All you got is your hustle, ain't no time for no hassle
Muscle for muscle they blast you and smash you laughin at you
On the move for your riches, where you burnin your bridges
Cheddar for cheddar but really can you handle the business?
On the streets you're a legend, all the money you're spendin
Bottle for bottle pretendin your reign is never-endin
Never wanted the glory, so for nothin I'm sorry
Body for body I'll smoke you just like a Rastafari
