[Verse 1 (B-Real)]
Working 9 to 5 all your life
Feeling like you're left behind
Everyday's a struggle
Breaking for that peace of mind
Livin' in division, listen
Something's fucking missing
Your mind is in a prison
I'ma free it check the vision
Fucking unify, unify
Motherfuckers unify
Raise up like a fist
"Smashit" like it's do or die

Standing on a rock
Staring at the cop
With the hose in hand
While you wanna hit the fucking blunt
We don't want no pipeline
Injustice of a lifetime
Brothers turn away
Like they don't see us spend a lifeline
High crimes
Does it make you wonder?
Stand together
Because there's strength in numbers

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There's strength in numbers!

[Chorus]
Strength in numbers!
Unify or it's do or die (x8)

[Verse 2 (Chuck D)]
Now the world wide web
Be checking what I said
Like I'm praying
Like I'm saying what's inside my head
You forgot
A motherfucker be on soc-med
And you rally round the family
Feds left for dead
Sleeping eye full of shit
He's been looking at peace
He [?]
For the believers, ugh

[Pre-Chorus 2]
That's why they're believing!

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Unify or it's do or die (x5)

[Outro]
Strength in numbers!
Unify or it's do or die (x4)

Strength in numbers!
(Strength, strength, strength!) (x4

Strength!
