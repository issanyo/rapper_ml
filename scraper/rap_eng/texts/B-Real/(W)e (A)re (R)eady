[Intro: Xzibit]
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, only that real shit
Serial killer (Killer, killer, killer, killer)
Yeah

[Verse 1: Xzibit]
I am authentic, all in this
You all did it to yourselves, killin' all the infidels
I will fight you niggas tooth and nail
Drinkin' vodka out the Holy Grail, while you tuckin' your tail
Rock it up in the cells
I got money for lawyers, I would not go to jail
Big bank, Wall Street, way too important to fail
Egg whites, spinach, and kale replace my cellular cell structure
Motherfucker, any percentage of nothin' is nothin'
Brass knuckles, Warren Buffett, never cuffin', no discussions
(Man, get the fuck out my face)
Yeah, nigga, no discussions
Get to the gun, bust it, I get to the bag fast
You niggas is not touchin' X-to-the-Z
The power invested in me, I violate and defeat
Annihilate, compete, affiliated with streets
Open bar entertainment where everybody eats

[Chorus: Demrick]
Lemme tell you what the fuck is goin' on in America
One false move, gettin' shot up in your area
(Five men standing, five men fall
One suspect and no one found)
Lemme tell you what the fuck goin' on in America
Billions gettin' made off of fear and hysteria
(Five men standing, five men fall
One suspect and no one found)

[Verse 2: Demrick & Xzibit]
I took a pledge like a Que Dog
Knock a bitch like a cue ball
Carry my weight like a U-Haul
Serial Killers is the crew, y'all, nature of the threat
Daily threads, ass, cam, and booyah
Rest in power to the godfather
Our Father in Heaven, forgive me, I'ma try harder
Bruce Willis, I'ma die harder, go farther
No, father never bothered
Bitches call me the real don dada

[Verse 3: B-Real]
Welcome back like Carter
Life's harder, work smarter
I'm on a charter plane trip to Carta
Kickin' bitches in the hole, it's Sparta persona, non grata
Fucks, I'm givin' nada
Sippin' on a pi√±a colada
Hear me on the track, trainspotter
Willy Wonka with the gold ticket to a stomp out
Real shot in the perif', and all the comp out

[Chorus: Demrick]
Lemme tell you what the fuck is goin' on in America
One false move, gettin' shot up in your area
(Five men standing, five men fall
One suspect and no one found)
Lemme tell you what the fuck goin' on in America
Billions gettin' made off of fear and hysteria
(Five men standing, five men fall
One suspect and no one found)
