I'mma need a zip, I'mma need a zip

I'mma need a zip, I'mma need a zip

[Verse 1]
Uh, mix it with some wax, lay it on your back
Never on a wrap, we can bend it that
Chain-smoker rolling up, back to back
I'm the Doctor, I prescribe her with the sack
Eat her up just like a edible
You know the king of the medical
Put my weed up on a pedestal
Yep, no you won't find nothing identical
Ain't nothing wrong with the Mary
I roll up and light up the cherry
Ha, it's been a minute since you got that
Ha, Dr. Green to my [?]

[Verse 2]
Like a murder, take a burner
Light up to kill
Since Cypress Hill
I've been getting higher still
Hitting it out the glass
With the dabs, and you pass
Rolling the weed on her ass
Then we get back to the cash
Necessary, everything we do is legendary
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary
It gets very scary
It's that killer
It'll put you in the cemetery
Call the coroner
Cause you'll need an obituary
When it comes to the cannabis
You should know I'm the man at this
Go ahead, try a gram of this
You get high as my standards is
And that's very high
If you know me
I'mma need me a whole zip
Off that OG
