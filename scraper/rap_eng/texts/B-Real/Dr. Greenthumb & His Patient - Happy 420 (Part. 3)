Intro:
Hello Dr. Greenthumb
Paging Dr. Greenthumb

(Verse 1:)(B-Real & Skam)
B-Real: Hello my name is Dr.Greenthumb
Skam:   I like to tell you just where we from!
B-Real: from the hills where the trees grow wild with weed fields
Skam:   Everyday sunshine, and we never run out!
B-Real: Greenhouse effect, with the weed connect!
Skam:   We got the kind of weed, that makes every chick wet!

B-Real: HPS, God Bless the whole crop
Please God, Don't Let me see no cops!
Skam:  'Weed is bad man', but what about liquor shops
Like Lodi-Dodi, we came here to celebrate and don't hurt nobody!
We ain't licking shots, gun toting
We just here smoking, marijhuana toking

B-Real: But fuck that, I study the 215 trip (I keep em off your back)
That way when they come they can suck my dick
Weed can't grow without attention
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb (uh!)

(Chorus:) (B-Real & SenDog)
B-Real: Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
SenDog: Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
B-Real: I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
SenDog: Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
B-Real: Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb
SenDog: Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!
B-Real: I'd like to tell you just where I'm from
SenDog: Aiyyo Dr. Greenthumb, come on back one time!

(Verse 2:) (B-Real & Skam)
B-Real: People can't live without the herb man!
Skam:   Plant it in the ground so we can smoke man!
B-Real: but thanks to Dr.Greenthumbs weed grows
Skam:   The Doctor taught me how to smoke this 'dro

B-Real: To the kush plant brushing a tangerine dream
Skam:   Sticky-icky-icky, like it's supposed to be!
B-Real: Cycles of weed are constantly grown
Skam:   But ain't no weed like greenthumbs homegrown

B-Real & Skam: I like to stop but it feels so good!
Skam:   Smell so strong, man, just like it should!
B-Real: Sticky angel, I wanna leave it alone
Skam:   But with you by my side, I don't feel so alone!

B-Real: What that funny sound knocking at the door?
Skam:   Oh shit, We can't talk no more!

B-Real: Please don't follow me into the sun
Hello my name is Dr. Greenthumb!

(Chorus:) (B-Real & SenDog)

(Bridge:) (B-Real & Skam)
B-Real:
Out from the lab, no need for rehab
If I can't drive then call me a cab (taxi!)
In my closet the weed is dried out
Like Eiht said, ain't no place to hide out

Skam:
My doctor never prescribes me pills
Chip in, vibe out, and lets me chill
Eyes low, hydro, high till I reach these hills

Outro:
Haha, Happy 420! Haha!
