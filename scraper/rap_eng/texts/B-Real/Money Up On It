[Verse 1]
Whip smoked out, windows cracked
Smoke billows out
Whoopie in the back
Dipping dab, choking bitches out
Limo tints, painted black
No jokes, we're about
Everything in fact, I made a pact
Get it in and out
Started in my yard
A few trees, nothing major
Some years later
I be blowing out the fucking flavor
OGs from OGs and more trees
Passing through the valley
Southern Cali
Fucking smell the breeze
Wanna see me?
Make a call to my office
And my nurses make appointments
Take a card for your wallet
I'mma call away
Call on me but don't
Try to fuck my homie
You're Tony, I'm Salsa
You fucking little monkey

[Hook]
I got the product
Who want it, who want it
Put your money up on it
Put your money up on it

You know I'm 'bout it
I got it, you want it
Put your money up on it
Put your money up on it

[Verse 2]
Sitting on stacks, hundred packs
Racks spilling out
Ain't no babies on the track
Black jack, chipping out
Fitted fucking hat
Greenthumb, and it's written out
You wonder where I'm at
You silly bum, can't get it out
I fill out my prescriptions
Anytime for my patients
My survival in the game
It made it hard for you fakers
Take a second, breathe it out
Don't be reaching for no heaters
See my nurses got you locked
I'll burn you down and throw the beat on
Rat-a-tat-tat
Body bags in the trunk
Wish you had a body double
When the Doctor calls your number
I know that my new competition
There's a code that we live with
Don't be fucking with another's grind
Mind your position
Come on

[Hook]
I got the product
Who want it, who want it
Put your money up on it
Put your money up on it

You know I'm 'bout it
I got it, you want it
Put your money up on it
Put your money up on it

[Bridge]
(I know you want that jet fuel)
Put your money up on it
(You want that Paris OG)
Put your money up on it
(You want that fucking m-dog)
Put your money up on it
(If you fuck with Dr. Greenthumb)
Put your money up on it

[Verse 3]
Living the life many others would dream
People would kill to be part of the team
Steady we rolling and holding the green
Growing you knowing a part of the theme
Haters to hate when I show them the way
Watching them plotting the paper I chase
Only for soldiers committed
The hustle for nothing
You fronting that bitches I slay
I ball 'til I fall
Get it all
See the Doctor stunting
You could make a call for the loud
It ain't nothing
See me pushing out
Will spin you in the rear view
Screaming out my name
But the Doctor cannot hear you
