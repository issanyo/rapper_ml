[Hook: Maria Grazia]
I close my eyes and I deny
Drift off beneath the desert sky
Until my soul finds you

[Verse 1: Apathy]
Let 'em know I'm going down to Mexico
To watch God and The Devil arm wrestle for my soul
With a bitch from San Diego, driving a Winnebago
High on a little llello, dying to get some Pesos
And I ain't one for fiction, or much for superstition
But I'm way out of my guardian angel's jurisdiction
The sun goes west till it's swallowed by the mountains
To the shitty city full of shady lawyers and accountants
Where everybody is looking for something, they're on a mission
Like sex with three women and real cheap prescriptions
Rattlesnake attitude, weapon to the fullest
They always got guns, but never enough bullets
The bottle runs dry, sweat pouring from my head, playing Portishead
Crack another portion for the dead
Bought a candy skull figure with a porcelain head
Praying to the porcelain god as I'm puking up red

[Hook: Maria Grazia]
I close my eyes and I deny
Drift off beneath the desert sky
Until my soul finds you
I close my eyes and I deny
Drift off beneath the desert sky
Until my soul finds you

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
So what that I'm cold-blooded
Old gutter mental' shows more now cause I'm so budded
With snow covered nose holes, blizzard it's no summer
Acts as a soul-number, kill my pain
Ima talk my slang, booze out Caine
I ain't looking for the answers I just dos my thing
Lock handshakes with snakes in a vein
Paced and I aim, brace for the bang
And now I'm in a place for the strange
Everything's a blur, every word is slurred
Every movement swerved and curved, by dope scored on the curb
Loc smoked on the herb and hit a high
I've been stuck for a minute like this whole life has passed me by
That's why I never know what I'm looking for
Every time I take a trip to the liquor store
Still trying to take it slow
Better lie low on this runaway train with no aim and a claim on my soul

[Hook: Maria Grazia]
I close my eyes and I deny
Drift off beneath the desert sky
Until my soul finds you
I close my eyes and I deny
Drift off beneath the desert sky
Until my soul finds you

[Verse 3: B-Real]
I'm seeing shit sorta distorted, I'm transported
And short of a quarter, a man sorely deported
No peace of mind, recorded this piece so blind
Dreaming of easier times, conflicted in losing my grind
Stepping away to ?fade? and debating if
It's worth the waiting on something to call to me
While this darkness pursues me, I'm woozy
And light headed, this is something I dreaded, affected by the pain deaded with medication, I said it
I'm getting ready for a deadly medley ahead
The street is my canvas and I paint it with red
Snake bitten from handshakes and bad breaks
When man makes mistakes for his sake in his take, and this snake...
Gets his fucking head cut off
One swing and one ding, you know I will never shut off
My vengeance eternal, my heart the inferno
But the buck is my shadow, check it now, yeah these words are my journal

[Hook: Maria Grazia]
I close my eyes and I deny
Drift off beneath the desert sky
Until my soul finds you
I close my eyes and I deny
Drift off beneath the desert sky
Until my soul finds you
I close my eyes and I deny
Drift off beneath the desert sky
Until my soul finds you
I close my eyes and I deny
Drift off beneath the desert sky
Until my soul finds you
