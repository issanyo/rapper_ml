[Intro]
You can get used to it
But you can't get used to people shootin' atcha

[*War sounds*]

[Chorus]
Don't talk about crimes that you saw
You don't want to get mixed in the war
Hell, are you crazy?
If you think there could ever be peace
With the streets and the police
Forget about the faces you saw
This inflicts the casualties of war
Hell, are you crazy?
If you think there could ever be peace
With the streets and the police

[Verse 1: Big Duke]
Wicked smiling, illuminates, my face
Right before the rapid violence
Lyrically an assassin, dashing
When the cop unit crashing
Shot, kill, la-ter-eal slash
Who am I to blast? L.A. pigs that are rats
Hands in the bag, pull a fat stash from the pocket
And I, higher than a NASA rocket
Black and white as you shake to pray
Fuck around and live the next day
Okay, when I'm rolling in the streets of the guero
Window down like a perro
When we're in the dragon belly
Fuckin' police wanna fade me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
The thrill is gone from childhood
To surviving rough neighborhoods
From shattered innocence to militants
For instance they become delinquents
Caught up in a realm of smoke
Like a stick of burning incense
[Smelling the aromas] of death and its evident
Your life is in his hands
Your faith in god is irrelevant
If he decides to pull the trigger or to not
If he decides to tank, take your bank
That's the end of life
You live through this episode
Nothin' you can do
Cause every criminal is from the same crew
And the cops don't give a fuck about you either
They look at gang activity
And play-follow the leader
Temptation rules over for drugs and money
Your bloods is colder
Now you are the metal piece holder

[Hook]

[Outro: Big Duke]
Look out
We gotta have a Million Man March muthafuckas
Gangsta style you know what I'm saying
Let's get a million bald-headed muthafuckas on the front line
What the fuck are you gonna do?
