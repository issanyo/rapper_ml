[Intro]
Once upon a time...
There were 3 individuals with 3 different motivations
One driven on pure vegeance
One with greed and power and the third, bare ambition
We will give you the exact account of these 3 individuals
And how their destinies collide
We now present to you, in full audio visualization, La Conecta
Parts one and two

[Intro]
Yeah, why don't you take a hit of this and relax, man?
[B-Real] Yeah, give me this shit, man
I need something, man
I'm tired of Jesus fucking holding us back all the goddamn time
We've been working for him for too long for this shit
And we ain't got nothing
We're gonna get our shit right
We're gonna take over his whole shit

[Verse 1: B-Real]
Now I'm tired of makin' all these other mothafucka's money
While they sit back and leave it all up to Sonny
It's been a long time I've worked for this lying piece of shit
Now I'm trying to make my own grip
For so long, I've been number two
Fuck that, I got to break off and make my own crew
I'm tired of being held back and lied to
Like a vato with no respect, see what I do
Checkin' this old fool and takin' over everything
And every mothafucka with 'em gotta die too
It's time for a change of power
I planted two guards on the watch tower

[Break]
[Boss] Joaquin, it's so good to see you
[Jack] Hey, yes
[Boss] I've brought you here because I understand that you want tp come up in the ranks
[Jack] And those are my intentions
[Boss] Now it's all about what you're willing to do for these ranks
[Jack] Anything, anything you ask
[Boss] Is that right?
[Jack] Yeah
[Boss] Well, I want you to take out Sonny

[Verse 2: Sick Jacken]
I'm the vato's right hand man, main man, gato
And when he goes out, I'm takin' over the scam
I ran little blocks for tax, everybody for static control
Now I hold a position for sure
Over those who roll, they get in my way, they lay
In a hole tryin' to tamper goal
Tryin' to move in like this Cuban, thinks it's his spot
But there's no room for the two at the top
Word is he's tryin' to serve this organization
For the unnotted service
The boss is getting nervous
This is my chance to advance; I'm getting cynical
This guy being alive makes the situation critical

[Break]
[Boss] Hey Gus! How you doin'?!
Get your fucking ass on the floor
You're gonna tell me you don't know nothing about Jesus?
[Duke] Nah what the fuck? Ey man, I haven't done shit

[Verse 3: Big Duke]
Why are my wrists being shackled in chains?
They claim I am wanted, murderous assist man
At first I thought it was a government scheme
Sticking me at the center of the crime scene
It seems I'm being held for, being helpful
In homicide; why'd they try to give me life double?
When I was made, wasn't I made untouchable
By my family? give my life to crime committee
Now in a time of need, you're saying fuck me
What makes you wanna play me shady?
I protected your life, now I'm offered as sacrifice
To the law with no ties at all
When the boss dies, the whole kingdom falls
