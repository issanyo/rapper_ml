[Verse 1: Berner]
Talk is cheap and I ain't speakin' 'til the check's cut
All these zeros in my bank will fuck your head up
The smoke floatin' and the Benz smell like cat piss
Self-made, it feels good, I never had shit
This guy told me 'bout his city, said, "Let's fill it up"
Half a million clones on me, need some bigger trucks
B-Real brought some shit I ain't never seen
White ashes on my jeans, this shit is burnin'
Yeah, I'm smokin' 'til my lungs hurt
Lemonade, tangerines, Gelotti Ice, hash and the vibe make it hard to breathe
Yeah, let me pass it to the left hand
Stree kills, you lookin' at a dead man
Damn

[Chorus: B-Real]
Say what'chu wanna say, now you ain't sayin' nothin'
I hear your mouth runnin', you ain't sayin' nothin'
I never had much, quit tryna have somethin'
You ain't movin' but your talkin', don't tell me nothin'
Say what'chu wanna say, now you ain't sayin' nothin'
I hear your mouth runnin', you ain't sayin' nothin'
I never had much, quit tryna have somethin'
You ain't movin' but your talkin' don't tell me nothin'

[Verse 2: B-Real]
You wanna talk? Give me twenty stacks
Got your money sacks, sellin' dreams, takin' money back
From the land of PAX and big Jaws, no comin' back
Livin' in your big homes while we on the money track
Ain't it funny that they be livin' in a fantasy?
Tryna buy your name, soakin' up the game, let it be
They could never win like we do, it's who we are
Screamin' doctor let me in, hey, I'ma superstar
I don't hear a thing in the haze from the insane connected to the brain
What'chu say? You talkin' in vein
Stay up in your lane, feel the pain
Yeah, we really rain, steady makin' gains
Runnin' thangs like a money gang, come on

[Chorus: B-Real]
Say what'chu wanna say, now you ain't sayin' nothin'
I hear your mouth runnin', you ain't sayin' nothin'
I never had much, quit tryna have somethin'
You ain't movin' but your talkin', don't tell me nothin'
Say what'chu wanna say, now you ain't sayin' nothin'
I hear your mouth runnin', you ain't sayin' nothin'
I never had much, quit tryna have somethin'
You ain't movin' but your talkin' don't tell me nothin'
