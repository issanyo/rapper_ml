Switchin' lanes back and forth, puffin' strains of Indo We ridin' high
Foot on the gas, car full of weed smoke Ridin' high
Laid back, smooth, let it put you in the mood We ridin' high
We're the Kings of the Chronic and this is how we do

D-Loc:
When I bounce out, I got a pocket full of weed
Pants always sagged, Double Dash burnin' trees
Seat cocked back, got my shit bumpin
Stop at the liquor store to get a little somethin'
Pick a 12 pack up, a couple of blunts
Go back to the crib, now it's time to get drunk
Call my girl up, cause I need a lil' love
Roll another blunt, let the smoke float above

J Rich:
On a Sunday afternoon, just washin' my car
Gettin' it ready for the night and the boulevard
Polishin' all the chrome and shinin' up the tires
Smokin' joint after joint, I couldn't get no higher
Keep a mini-bong chillin' in my cup holder
Plus a bag in my lap full of nothin' but the doja
Cruisin' out the neighborhood on a slow stoncreek ??
I'm just out ridin' high, simply doin' my thing

Chorus

B-Real:
Hittin' the weed and become just like me
Kush smokin' rebel full of THC
One hit, two hit, three hit, four
Then five more hits from my eight foot Roor
Then roll that shit up and hit it, pass it around
Don't hog it up or we take it away and put you down
You wanna medicate, meditate
Been known for hittin' the bong
Blunts, and the vaporate
We ridin' high with an endless supply
Because we ridin high and put the red in your eyes
We sack it up in three months, packin' the free lunch
After the 420, we stackin' the damn money
And so it goes if you're holidn' the dro
Break it out, blaze it up, then you hittin' & hold
With the KMK or the Cypress blend
You better twist those ends and go tell your friends

Chorus

Daddy X:
We rollin' out like Willy and the Chocolate Bunch
With the tailpipe blowin' nothin' but the Skunk
Easy ridin, we some high ombres
Westside to the head, smokin hay all day
See the police, they ain't phasin' me
I've had a lot of cops sit down & blaze with me
Throw their guns and their badge on the table
And break out a pound of the confiscated label
