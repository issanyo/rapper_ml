Wassup trill e.n.t u know what I'm saying
Bitch ass niggas be wondering what the fuck this shit mean to me
This shit mean everything to me nigga this all I got
Street life nigga still wild'n

Might catch me with my shirt off me and Turk just finished drop the work off
Niggas best wipes them smirks off honestly we'll hurt ya'll
Hit them niggas heart tell big boi to skurt off
Ten toes down knocked ten hoes down
One night one fight empty 50 whole round

Cali one flight now that's fifty whole pounds
Niggas acting like bitches I'll sit they ass down
Tighten dat ass no rubber I like get in trouble
Know what happen when you scared be careful how you play it
All your money and your bread don't mean nothing when your dead
Old fruity  ass nigga smooth booty ass nigga
Think about me when I ain't around but when they see me  they shiver
Camera ass nigga fame ass nigga
Mug In the club when I make it rain ass nigga

[Chorus:]
The T for Trill the fam I told em I got em
The R for real and rovers and ready to die
The I for me cause I'm the fuckin hottest
The L for loyal and love for the leaders behind me
The L for long it's been a long time and finally
Everybody shining mane fuck it it's game time and I'm ready

This year all me we all where we all be
Want something call me try me and ya'll see
Mtv Bet tell em that it's all good
We won't talk how I'm living but we scared of ya'll hood
My homeboy stressed tell em keep his head up
Don't want go back to the slums so I keep my bread up
If I get my head buss I don't really give a fuck
Whats gon happen to my people only thing I'm scared of
When you look up in your mirror you see a pussy ass nigga
You don't see a boss hogg go getta that'll kill you
See a candy ol purple tally something with the glitter
Rims keep spinning fuck hoes I'll consider
Tote high four five dope house I was little
G'd up re'd up sold out sixty minutes
Trill fam still fam duck tape hit his face
Pay the lawyer beat case young savage get it straight

[Chorus:]
The T for Trill the fam I told em I got em
The R for real and rovers and ready to die
The I for me cause I'm the fuckin hottest
The L for loyal and love for the leaders behind me
The L for long it's been a long time and finally
Everybody shining mane fuck it it's game time and I'm ready
I'm webbie

While niggas be grinning and laughing and fakin and fronting
Moses like hoes trying to see how we working this company
Scoping with pistols and ropes and hoping we fumble
Open like some of these savage life ass wannabes
I'm who they wanna be you know I'm gonna be s.t.r.a.I.g.h.t
Pussy niggas hate me I'm a straight g
They tell me go comercial tell them bitches make me
Take me to the top that's what I told savage
Then he told webbie let's roll I'm ready
Fuck gold go platinum my goal is to snatch a
Old plaque from 2007 ooh that's what's happenen
And if I don't get it you know I ain't trippin
They don't make a real nigga I'm still a real nigga
Gon die a trill nigga been riding with trill niggas
We wasn't even in the picture had just had started to mention nigga

[Chorus:]
The T for Trill the fam I told em I got em
The R for real and rovers and ready to die
The I for me cause I'm the fuckin hottest
The L for loyal and love for the leaders behind me
The L for long it's been a long time and finally
Everybody shining mane fuck it it's game time and I'm ready
I'm webbie
I'm ready
I'm webbie
