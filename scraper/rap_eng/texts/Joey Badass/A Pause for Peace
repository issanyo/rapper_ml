[Intro]
Yeah, take a pause for peace
Time to take a pause for peace
Everybody feel me
My sisters and brothers
My fathers and mothers
Best friends and lovers
Everybody needs each other

[Verse: Joey Bada$$ and Chuck Strangers]
They tryna lock me up and throw away the key
They wanna see a nigga six feet deep
Over populated penitentiaries
They just gave a nigga where I'm from about a century
If I could just explain, you would feel my pain
Maybe I'm in insane
What they sayin', so what
No I ain't a saint, I'm a growing man
Learning everyday, I made mistakes
So what
If I could just explain, you would feel my pain
Maybe I'm in insane
What they sayin', so what
No I ain't a saint, I'm a growing man
Learning everyday, I made mistakes
So what, so what, so what, so what, so what, so what

[Outro]
Yeah, take a pause for peace
Time to take a pause for peace
Everybody...
