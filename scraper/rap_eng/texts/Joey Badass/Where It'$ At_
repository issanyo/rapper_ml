[Intro: Joey Bada$$ & Kirk Knight]
Aye what it is? One time, what up
Aye what it is? One time, what up
Aye what it is? Two time, what up
Two time, two time, what up
Aye what it is? One time, what up
Aye what it is? One time
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]
Let's get down tonight
I think I might blow a whole pound tonight
So shorty hit me with the spot and if it sound alright
Then you know I'm in the house, let a nigga run his mouth
It's going down on sight
I'm always down to fight, ain't duff a nigga in the while
No bluff, ain't no church when you're living in the wild
I was hidden in the crowd, rippin' on some loud
'Til I seen the sucka nigga dick-lickin' on my style
Wow, must've been the material linen
Whole night kept him in my peripheral vision
All I gotta say is the word and imperials get him
Word to my pops, I know niggas known for serial killin'
But back to the women, they tryna catch me slippin'
So I gotta pack a mags to stop venereal venoms
From entering my system
If it ain't my moms or my 'sis then, I cut'em in the system

[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & Kirk Knight]
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
Tell me where it's at and I'm in that spot (we got a lot to come true)
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 2: Joey BADA$$]
Yo let me tell you what I'm living like, same shit, just a different night
Super bad chicks and they all up in my kryptonite
'Bout to get down, I'm tryna get up in the tight
So roll the indo right and I can show you what them bitches like
They just wanna come and have fun
Told this little hun she could come but don't touch my funds
I might get crazy, I might bust a gun
So just give me some more and I might bust her son
Might bust and run, they said love will come knockin' at my door
Well I guess lust must've wrung
The dutch touch the lungs and it was on, had her beggin' for the dawn
'Til the crack of dawn then I passed it off to Kwon
I said it gotta be the swank if it ain't the rank
Cause some pull hoes like how dreamers pudo
Hold up, let me pull ove', told her to hop in then put it back and drove
And hit it out-park like Al Pujols

[Hook: Joey Bada$$ & Kirk Knight]
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at (yo fuck you Joey) and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
Tell me where it's at and I'm in that spot (we got a lot to come true)
Let me know, let me know
Let me know, let me know

[Verse 3: Kirk Knight]
She's so enticing, derogatory thoughts when I'm sighting
Slangs to get her wet
And I heard you're overflowing, I could test the waters like sea man
And I heard you like semen, see man
Well let me slide through, I know you're feelin' the kid
Cause these nonchalant lines is lettin' me in
Cause on contrast, I could see us lovebirds, it's in plain sight
And am I right cause I heard you like the international lovin'?
On a higher scale, when I mean scale, I do it well
Let me go deeper, feel like I'm doing it well
Word on the street you acting like a bastard, can I be you daddy?
You can hop up in my caddy, and I heard you got the fatty
Yeah cellurite
Just remember it's amazing how I come up on the track
So duck and weave, and please believe my side effect is shakin' knees
Damn here I go again with the suggestive themes

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
So tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (we got a lot to come true)
I said so tell me where it's at and I'm in the spot (so what you wanna do)
Tell me where it's at and I'm in that spot (we got a lot to come true)
