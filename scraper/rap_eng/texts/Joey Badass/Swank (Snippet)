[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Intro]
I got this track called Swank

[Verse 1]
Lost in his time
I'm just trynna get it
Like a boss in his prime
These fake niggas sublime light for fine sight
Wishing wheel fortune, but the price ain't quite right
This slice ain't quite ripe
Still pulling strings, I fly
But I don't like kites
How they gon' treat Brooklyn's finest
Not as fine as diamonds in fine nights
Sorrounded by hard flow like icelands
Now we gettin' ice and finance is nice
And i don't like surprises, i like surperb prices risin'
It's the least i can do, these verses pricelsss
Rehearse in private
Reverse her eyelids 'til she cursing silent

[Outro]
Yea that's it

Duck down, home of the original illspitters! (hahahah)
