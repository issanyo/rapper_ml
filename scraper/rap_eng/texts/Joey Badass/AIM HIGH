[Intro]
One two, one two
One two, one two
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up, hit 'em up
Hit 'em up, hit 'em up, hit 'em up
Yeah

[Hook]
I woke up, I looked up at the clock and I seen it was time
It unfolds in my eyes every time that my mom said she'd die
I'm just tryna get mine so I aim high, high
I'm just tryna get mine so I aim high, high

[Verse 1]
I swear I be bustin' the moves
Like I got nothin' to lose
Kickin' the flow till I'm scuffin' my shoes
It's Pro Era, interrupt on your news
Corruptin' your school like fuck the rules
Who the fuck are you?
My crew necks we rock good luck jewels that might blind ya
Brunettes rock to us too when they find us
World's finest, where in the world did they find us?
With remarkable timin', hot rhymin' and nice climates
Spit accurate, acrid acid, alleys on my penny tablet
She make it nasty when I freaky my Jamaican accent
I (?) get 'em
Sugar gonna love to see them moves (?)
All I need is some Goose (?)
When she get loose we hit her
Don't (?) we hit her
Pop off like a (?) we hit her
Squeeze, got the juice, got the (?) leaves
No seeds, no seeds
I wraps it up tremendously
I'm still gon' leave my legacy
When I'm gone, they gon' remember me
You'll see, you'll see, you'll see

[Hook]
I woke up, I looked up at the clock and I seen it was time
It unfolds in my eyes every time that my mom said she'd die
I'm just tryna get mine so I aim high, high
I'm just tryna get mine so I aim high, high

[Verse 2]
Swear I be huggin' the block
Till all my strugglin' stop
I put my momma in a comfortable spot
Where she ain't ever gotta work for no man
Or even fight to just stand
I control her with this mic in my hand
I got
One life to live, live it up, live it up
If you don't give a fuck put your middle fingers up
Don't ask me what it is what I got in my cup
You might live long if you sip this stuff
Elixir of life and still be mixin' the Sprite
I know young brothers be broke
I just be fixin' your wife
French kissin' wicked linguistic chickens got my tongue twisted
That pussy in my mouth, I be apexin' when I be flexin'
I go back in for seconds, beat the pussy up until it stretches
I (?) she saw, she caught it right dead in this jaw
It's a scar
Another one for the team
And now it's PE in the magazine
Don't touch that dial cause we on your screen
You wouldn't believe, you just had to seen
Swear I woke up and it was all a dream
Swear I woke up and it was all a dream
Swear I woke up and it was all a dream
It was all a dream

[Hook]
I woke up, I looked up at the clock and I seen it was time
It unfolds in my eyes every time that my mom said she'd die
I'm just tryna get mine so I aim high, high
I'm just tryna get mine so I aim high, high
