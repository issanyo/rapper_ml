[Intro]
I be tripping out in the booth I be booth killing
(Talking and laughter)
One tiiiiime

[Hook]
From start to finish, start to finish
Groupies get they hearts diminished,
Said it's hard to, finish these L's though
But me and my niggas, do it so well yo, yo

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Never pull out my dough, told her hand the J right and pull slow
I like em young but acting fully grown, the Phillies rolled, I'm fully on
Ain't got A.I.D but we in the cut fully blown, what you sippin on?
That Dom Pérignon, lame niggas carry on
Pottery got me on the same shit that Harry on
That black magic when I attack rappers
Attract havoc this protégé no that's tragic
But thats hazard so I gotta toast to the gods
Cause I ain't never trying to be approached on no ?
Like I don't spit vicious? Like I ain't what a real lyricist is?
Like record buttons ain't kill switches?
I swear that shit pisses me off, niggas biting my swank
That shit is ticking me off, see this style is forbidden
You wouldn't understand you need to read more scriptures
But more lists for me be more victims, nigga

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2: Rokamouth]
Yo, I be the badman, broader than Barrington
Hand off the wheel and I still got my handling
Still keep it real if I feel you enchancin'
Cause we make the moves you really think you know what's happen
No fake love romancin', I've come to the point where I can just plot my answers
Advancin, Still got no mansion, but I'mma get that dough for these clothes on my ransom
Fat bottom hoes on a chromed out tandem, and I ain't even ask em
They came to relax and blaze as we chat cause
Every girl love how us Brooklyn cats act, frontos and papers call that Flatbush strapped
Literally loungin black the founding cats of these indigo rap
BEASTCOAST growing right off my back, before I can hit you with these bars strong influenced by cats
Needle on track, I be hustling either from trappin or rap

[Hook x2]
