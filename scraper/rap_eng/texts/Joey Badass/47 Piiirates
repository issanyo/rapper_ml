[Intro]
Muh-fucking Pirates (Pirates) , We some muh-fucking pirates

[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
Look, now I could start it off with a whole new excerpt
A revisit what them experts said first
Your favorite rapper’s a problem I’m the next worst
It’s the naked truth I seep through em like wet shirts
Life’s a bitch, well I’m a super soaker
The newest flow got the mainstream moving over
Mother Nature got me shining from the depth of my soul
So every time you see her rise in a super nova
And in a world of dead presidents and counterfeits
Our generation is bound to take a count of it
I’m Barry Bonds with my count of hits
I put a fork in it, cork in it, hoping that it kinda fits
And this can turn into a hostage situation
'cuz I been sitting patient and I’m kinda sick of waitin’
John Q holdin’ up the doctors and the patients but sticking up the nurses is my favorite

[Hook: Capital STEEZ]
(Heh) We some muh-fucking pirates, We some muh-fucking pirates
And I decided that I would let my mind just ride on autopilot one word decribes it (2x)

[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]
I be that dirty mutherfucker, bitches want to clean me up
She needs a rest from the cons n She wants me to cuff
She got double D’s, I call it a drug bust
But I’m not slipping over lust, in God we trust, plus
I came from the bottom, who do you think you’re touching?
Bust in ya girl’s face, I know I’m good for nuttin’
All I do is smoke weed, set sails, and wait for my connect to hit me back with a little sumchin’
I speed so fast it’ll make ya head spin, who who’s that nigga that’s revvin’ the engine
I stand out when I stand up never did blend in
These bitches say I’m smoothy, though I’m rough around the edges
Ak-47 , STEEZ already said fuck ya reverend, we guna do this shit until forever end
So fucking pirates guna rain/reighn on ya parade, my eyes are hellabent and I stay hella laidback
