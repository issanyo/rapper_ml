This is the fucking resurrection
Get the fuck up niggas
The restoration of that real shit
HS87

[Verse 1: Price]
I be posing for photos, eating at Sotto Sotto
Mak's & 44s, bought that straps from the cholos
Packed in low lows, smell like Swisha packs and dodo
For sho sho, this that Austin Powers mojo flow
B O dub logo never disrespect the bro code
You mofos couldn't get over my bars with a pole vault
I'll Titanic any rapper trying to show boat
Notorious, Big L, -eft Eye Pac this that ghost flow
We pass on licks, will pass my bitch before I will pass the dutch
Disrespect you'll see tecs, UPS might package ya
Love a brown skin, thick, phat ass that bounce back at you
You niggas biting Count Dracula
We getting money we laugh at you
Now hold it
This the part where I finally woken
Drinking potion til I'm choking, Clarence Carter I be stroking
This that bitch I made in motion, your girl wanna fuck no joking
She told me she's home alone and tonight I'm Macaulay Culkin
We out here balling for no reason
So much money, white folks is calling us heathens
We giving meat to these women claiming they vegan
(We giving meat to these women claiming they vegan.)

[Hook]
Tis the season to be balling for no reason
Fuck it I'm not responsible
Tis the season to be balling for no reason
Fuck you I'm not responsible
Tis the season to be balling for no reason
Fuck you I'm not responsible

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Beware that new strain gun powder
Shoot it up your veins and puff power
Fiends on that chemical X for enough hours
When that adrenalin Russian Rou-let's arouse her
Cock it, cock it, when you had enough
I want you take it out the socket
Energy surge when you touch it, bring it, babe watch it
Turn up, little sumchin, keep that boom box thumping
That bass, that loud, her system be jumping
I just hope the speaker ain't bomb bumping
She take my jewels and she blow like she drying something
It's a must that she know that I ain't nutting
I ain't nothing, stereo type humping the wall
Acne on her face, beat bumping and all
I beat that loco with my 47 cholos
Please don't take no photos if it ain't of nosotros
Open up those Ojos, stop choking up that pojo, ho
Get your hustle on the floor, hit the door
I got that good shit for the low I let them know
So line them up, line them up, we 'bout to blow

[Hook]
Tis the season to be balling for no reason
Fuck you I'm not responsible
Tis the season to be balling for no reason
Fuck you I'm not responsible
Tis the season to be balling for no reason
Fuck you I'm not responsible

[Verse 3: Oktane]
Give me the snare and that kick
I need it the snare and that kick
I came to talk all my shit
You hating, hop off my dick
I'm MVP of this game
Same nigga, ain't shit changed
So if you wasn't here when I was walking
Then bitch don't get on that plane
Here we go
You niggas can't be serious, come on fam
I got a list of niggas I'm ready to stunt on fam
Like I'm the little nigga that you used to front on man
You still work at the same spot from when I left home? damn
Okay, you can talk all your shit, I'mma just make more hits
My team is winning by so much we'll make yours quit
Like I wear a size 5 nigga, I will never forfeit
Like size 5, 4, fit...
Ah, nigga fuck that shit
I step in fresher than two showers
You got dressed for like two hours
Your bitch like my girl
She came with me, you too sour
My niggas all real niggas
Your niggas are true cowards
I'm the king of the hill I don't need Hank, Bobby, or Boomhauer
To tell me that, don't want your shit, don't sell me that
Cops on us, we selling crack
Every bar on every track, no holding back
Hit told me we got to bring the West back so I helped him
So ladies and gentlemen, California's finally back
You're welcome, Oktane

[Hook]
