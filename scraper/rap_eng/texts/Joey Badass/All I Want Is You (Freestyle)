[Intro]
Okay I can fuck with this
I can fuck with this, yeah
I can fuck with this, yeah
I could give a fuck of what a, uh
I could give a fuck of what a
Yeah, check, check

[Verse]
I roam the streets
Me and my niggas cruisin'
Taking in the environment, marijuana abusing
Won't be tracked in confinement for any longer
Got a vision and a plan that keep growing stronger
That's on my momma
She still be thinking about that diploma
That I never got, so I made her a business owner
Fuck it this what I owed her, for all the
Times that I called her over things I couldn' t comprehend 'til when I got older
Now there's heavy things, I be on my shoulder
I hold the chip of my loner like nigga what
Even with the d- in my hand, won't give it up
I'm good with the pressure, I made my diamonds in the rough
My skin is Sierra Leone tough, and now that we on up
It's only right that we shine, these jewelerys will blind ya
But nah, I'm just checking time
'Cause i'm really referring to the jewels I got in mind
'Cause i'm so aligned with the divine
Word is bond
Gotta break the lines down to the atoms and bonds
To find out, what the fuck I'm rhymin' 'bout
It's the God child, intellectual don-style
Got so much bars niggas wonder how he ain't on trial
No cases on file
Said that shit from overseas
Nigga hopped up on my stage, sent him to the nosebleeds
And the lawyer in his sleep
And the preacher had to sleep
I got over the next day, they seen Obama's daughter in my tee
Blessings in the sky from my bredrins in the sky
Ain't never telling lies, just opening eyes
Of the youth, with the truth
Everyday, it's what I do
I mean it's what I dedicate my whole existence to
I mean of course I'ma celebrate my riches too
I know I floss a little, but that's what young niggas do
Imma move how I move
Hold it down like a general
Joey Bada$$ to smooth, the best rapper in general nigga

[Outro]
This is, this is not even breakfast bars, this Patr√≥n bars
