The flows is acidic
Cruising in a slow-ass Civic, I got gas, hit it
Hold up, cops passed, I stop, laugh, hit it
Jakes is snake lizards, if they smell they won't come hither
Nigga, I hisses at your misses
Slither down her throat, spit her up, (mmm) delicious
I'm too malicious, this one for my mistresses
In distress, cause positions that I put 'em in could stretch
Them can't contest him, get the rude boy vex
True shotta to give him two shots, rude bwoy fi dead
Boom, bye bye in a batty man head
The sooner I die, sooner them gets ahead
So you do the math, put the pieces to the puzzles like
Voodoo in the trap, no string attached
In fact, it's all connected in the sense, neglected in the
Cents, plus well collecting my respect, respect
