[Sway]
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Yeah, yeah, man
We just accumulated some of the sickest emcees to touch the mic
This the new generation, the now generation
Movin' hip-hop into the future
They all spitters, welcome to RapFix
This a Pro Era takeover
Who's first to rock, man?

[Verse 1: Dessy Hinds]
I'm what you get on the Fifth with bloodiness sittin' on the cuttin' list
Numbness and boom bristles and tissues leadin' up to what you scopin' with
Hold deadly weaponry straight from the West Indies
It could make you rest with ease
Ready to slice your craft for some extra cheese
Extra terrestrials know that I extra please
Know when I give them extra knees I make fools at the extra knees
Now come through with the extra B's I got the extra C's
I can make anybody fly overseas over C's

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Rap circles 'round rap circles, ya team is squares
And popsicles, my team's fared obstacles
Impossible to get around 'em
Got'cha surrounded cycle the block, drop bicycles wildin'
Piggy eaters in the kitchen servin' up Italian
What's the recipe he dishin' today? Some Shaolin
Mix of B.I.G., addition to Jay
A little Zulu stylin' and the best vibe from the islands
Now that's a real deal meal
But tick it the clock go still
So I'm not gon' chill until my whole team across the map and back
We been warnin' them since the first attack
Now the A-bombs is ready to deploy, enjoy
The Pros been ready to destroy
I said the A-bombs is ready to deploy, enjoy
The Pros been ready to destroy

[Verse 3: A La $ole]
Word to my brother man Steelo
All my niggas in it for the win like a torpedo
If ya flow tight, my flow vent toward Speedo
My speed though, three [?]
I'm finna remain the reason, so be gone
Soul flow, solicitin' arithmetic like Modo
Extractin' all the ignorance from radios
But they don't play me though
We the real kings here, you on a jamie flow
Bell boy you would think I'm Hellboy, say ya grace
Clickity-clack, boom, pow-wow, we runnin' up in ya space
These rap niggas been wrapped up in the trap
While I planted twenty bombs, be gone I am [?]
Explosions overloadin' when I flex
Pick up crack sock, feel my sole kickin' ya chest
So don't forget my set, we will reset any threat
Try your best but you comin' up in debt

[Verse 4: CJ Fly]
It's a heist
I think it's safe to say that I'm the highest
Always savor the highs
Say your bars or say goodbye
Keep ya guard up, only one that can savor your byes
Prayin' when he hear ya cries
Tyrna make paper on sight, when I'm tearin' ya eye
Goddamn, I gotta live like the god that I am
Her cleanliness is next to godly [?]
I decided to start sweepin' the competition

[Verse 5: Dirty Sanchez]
This got my chakras goin' crazy, maintain balance
Or we can get lifted off the purp like Aladdin
On the rug burnin' all hail mary from stars upside-down
I'm satanic but I'm hell-bound
I'm from the real city of sin since New Yuck City built
Split ends like kids from Chinchoti
If you eatin' that [?] I'mma eat too
Give me sick army fatigue so you can't see me
Still always on the move, it's PE so you know the drill
Screws loose and I didn't finish school
That's for dropouts, tracks droppin' like rain when you feelin' the drought
And yo' umbrella won't make it through
So if they actin' like they real that don't make it true
Make ya move, you confused when you thinkin' that you messin' with the few
Yo, understand who it is, it's PE to you
Top dogs got kin good but I'm kickin' the stools
Four-seven

[Verse 6: Kirk Knight]
He gon' blow? Man, that's kinda iffy
But fail to understand that I'm the drug in your kidneys
Infection in urethra pissing ether through your kidneys
So all y'all out there, son, it's what your kid needs
And hell no, I ain't feelin' that great
Mary Jane buried the flower of life I'm glad I ate
I got a mainstress, I got two of the best strippers
So they cross both sides, so occasion I say "scissor"
I don't say "twerk", mama I say "raw"
You gotta step them cookies if you tryna evolve
Catchin' up Z's while y'all fade to black
This is a little wild, weeded out my same pack
Life savorin', they like night fall tryna blackball
Made me 5,173 degrees
Bring the heat, from bell scars to earnin' war bonds
Politicin' with my nation and now, now that word is bond
We movin' like the Jewish
Now you, son, you dread the fact that we across the whole grid

[Verse 7: Nyck Caution]
Flip a quarter 'round some profit, now my mornin' proper
Sour diesel, pick your poison, boys is boilin' product
This wack shit is comin' back
But everything is digital
I'm diggin' through the Internet and dealin' with the sinnin' through it
Y-C-K, and I put it first
And I put 'em in they place, prove that puddin' in a verse
I'm movin' through the city, from the ghetto to the 'burbs
Y'all don't get this nevermore, but I'm Edgar to these birds, word
Yo, loiterin' like I was unimportant
I'm alone because I'm unemployed?
Stu-stu-stutterin' you'll prolly blow the moment
Fuck a plan B, once you ridin' that's ya only choice
Like the rubber pop
I got one option like a baby mother's crotch
You either let this shit die before it sprout
But you can never underestimate what hasn't blossomed
Yo, I keep my retinas peeled
I'm the rest of you meal dwellers with jealous appeal
Do not step to the good fellas, these weapons is real
Pop a vessel, no respectin' his feel
Peep the words out and leave an instrumental for real
I been lyin' to my momma, though
Tellin' her that I been doin' good, but I'm signin' off
I ain't seen her face in two months
Need to grind and make everything that I involve in these phone calls
But I popped too many Tylenol
Trouble on my mind, there's liquor in my Styrofoam
Jugglin' my life, I just hope  I never die alone
Yo, you just gotta feel the purpose
I ain't gotta chill, I ain't tryna chill with no more serpents
I'm up with Rob Markson
I'm a marks and I throw darts at your target
Bulls-eye since I started
I do this shit at random
Ay, yo, Sway, am I nice? (yes)
Damn, I knew you had the answers

[Kirk Knight]
One thing I just wanted to say
And that was a Kirk Knight production, man, we out here
