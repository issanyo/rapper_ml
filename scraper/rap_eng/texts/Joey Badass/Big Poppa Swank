[Verse 1]
Rock swank swank rock Big Poppa $wank
Fill up banks, 'til it pops
Used to collect box tops thinking I was the fresh prince of welfare
Never knew fear well, so please beware
Cause it's hard to say good-bye, ooh
I wish a nigga would reply, fool
Thinking I could chat, I lied
Catch you on a map, hope you got all eyes
Open, if not, I'm red eye scoping
Rasta, rise; pothead with the dreadlocks spoken
Jah know, hold up man change the channel
Frequency switch, drop Babylon dome
My cover blown, so you feely him alone
Diamonds in my blood from Sierra Leone
How you mean, that's your queen, but she down
My whole tiara her crown
Flying over heads with pterodactyl sounds
Saber-toothed hound, the most prehistoric cats, ask around
Survival tactics is finally active
Snap a lying nigga neck, food chain reaction

[Bridge]
And that's what happens when you fuck with the craftsman
And that's what happens when you fuck with the craftsman
And that's what happens when you fuck with the craftsman
On my 47 shit to the casket

[Hook x4]
Rock swank swank rock
Rock swank let it rock
