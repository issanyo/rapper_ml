[INTRO: Maverick Sabre]
Maybe I'mma fly away
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day

[FIRST VERSE]
Maybe I don't pick up cause my mom never called
Everybody dropped a nigga im the leaves in the fall
Raised with cartoon sketchers my brothers love to draw
So there's constant depictions of white lines On the floor
We've been running suicides can you smell defeat
Hunger stemming from those nights when we had nothing to eat
Kings or slaves conflict over the discrepancy
And our temper shorter than our life expectancy
Was only 8 when i first stood in a pool of blood
Her body planted on cement the fate of the rose bud
When I looked in her eyes saw a reflection of us
Life slipping away because we never knew love
Only witnessed Jim Crow never seen a white dove
Peace carried our anger, this ubiquitous danger only sink or rise above
I'm pitching more than what it seams, get your baseball glove

[HOOK: Joey Bada$$]
So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

[BRIDGE: Maverick Sabre]
One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
