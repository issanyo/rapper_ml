[Verse 1]
If you could see the world through my corneas
The corner of my eye, I block out the erroneous
Sometimes I wish they made these contacts with euphoria
Then maybe I could bear to open my eyelids more accordingly
Underage kids pour Georgi Porgi
And get grooved up til four in the morning
With four tenderonis off one orgy
At the crack of dawn, get the crack at the Don Corleone
And I'm feeling like I got it made man
They smell the bait all on me and ask "what you made man?"
But that don't really count if you ain't saving
They enslaving my people straight to the grave and
Minimum wage at war, ask what we fighting for
Need more oil? Sure of course
Just grab a piece of the pie, three-point-one-four
159 lives hit the floor and break celestial walls
Per second
And these niggas think it's rap that got me stressing
It's about to be a rap when I pick the Smith and Wesson up
Cause these words ain't enough to be defending us

[Hook]
But I try
I try
I try
I try

[Verse 2:]
An eye for an eye make the world go 'round
An eye for a guy make your girl go down
She sip the shit like it's liquor
But coming out my god body, it's like elixir
She trying to prolong life, I'm trying to prolong my dick and shit
I give it to her quick, that's a sad predicament
I swear I hate predicting shit, she said it taste magnificent
Sour like piff, but sweet like black licorice
Bitches, money, and weed, same shit, just ignorance
But how you expect me to act? Less black, less niggerish?
Fuck that, money control all my niggas shit
And the white man stay trying to get a nigga rich
And turn us on each other, like, what we fighting for?
Need more whores, another Porsche, of course
Just grab a piece of the pie, three-point-one-four
159 dimes hit the floor and break they jaws
Make that kushy applause
Per second
If only these niggas knew it's rapping that got me stressing
Bitches popping off like my Smith and Wesson

[Hook:]
Cause I try
I try
Cause I try
I try

Ain't trying hard enough...
