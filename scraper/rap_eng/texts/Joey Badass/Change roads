[Brian Bentley]

[verse 1]
Try to change me, and brother you fail
I be like a train, that's looking for a trail
Mind on my money, money Is my sail
Im always big, enemies, small scaled
Yeah.... cause I got to succeed
I wanna give my family what they really need
Yea I need the cash, yea I need the gualla
Cause I wanna help the world including my mama
My papa , my whole fam everybody
I ain't telling no jokes no joke eddie murphy
Now I'm getting really strong and big like Mark Henry
They all look at me, they copying Brian Bentley
Looking for a guy like me there ain't many
Hard in the paint, benny
Got change my roads
From here to Europe

[verse 2]

Being different isn't bad
Fitting in is lack
Of self confidence
I don't give a crap, I still do my thang
I still pop that thang ... man damn
Haters chuck me off but I return like boomerangs
Hating on my dynamite like Yosemite Sam
Someone tell these people who the hell I really am
Brian Bentley, Bentley yea he always do his thang
I choke slam haters like a signature move
Get flipped with my math like integers do
I started at night now quarter past two
All night all day yeah hustling through
If you people dope than i'm crack
I'm working on my skill like a bicep
The skill that you biting like my Mike Tyson
Either hate me love me decide it


We got to change the way
(change)
Always travel new roads
(new roads)
From earth to pluto
I keep reaching new worlds
