[Verse 1: A$AP Twelvyy]
I need a week in Tahiti, I spend the weekend in Fiji
I prolly sleep in the teepee, I'm on a boat if you need me
She on the coast in bikinis, I mix patron with the kiwis
I got some stones in my VV's, don't want the moment to leave me
I just got back from Japan and I'm like, "Konichiwa, bitches"
I pour some heat for my bitches, I'm like a Lee how I kick it
I can't believe how i did it, my people preachin' my scriptures
I'm posin' peace in my pictures, I mix the weed with the liquor

[Chorus: A$AP Twelvyy & Joey Bada$$]
I'm on the way
Countin' down my days, I'm on the way (way, yeah)
Paradise sure look in my way (way, yeah)
Shawty talk too much, you in my way, yeah

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
I be soaking up game
Copin' with pain, fame, now they gon' remember my name
I be stuck in my brain, sayin'
Life as we know will never be the muthafuckin' same
It's a goddamn shame, used to hop off them trains
Now we hoppin' off them planes
Mind in a trance, somewhere in the middle of France
With a itty-bitty trip and her friends
Lit off the Henn', fly is on 10
Only thing missin' is the roof on the Benz
Got a bad bitch and she keepin' champagne
For a nigga like me but I never payed rent
Throw a couple bands, no occasion
Live everyday like a celebration
Came a long way, I knew we'd make it
Never mattered how much time we taking
Okay, I got love for my city, everywhere that I go
Know I keep that shit in me within my heart and my soul
You know I ride for my Pros, we came up from the low
My first year being rich, my last year being broke!
Ya bitch!

[Chorus: A$AP Twelvyy & Joey Bada$$]
I'm on the way
Countin' down my days, I'm on the way (way, yeah)
Paradise sure look in my way (way, yeah)
Shawty talk too much, you in my way, yeah
I'm on the way (A$AP Era)
Countin' down my days I'm on the way (way, yeah)
Paradise sure look in my way (way, yeah)
Shawty talk too much, you in my way, yeah

[Outro: Telana harmonizing]
