[Verse 1]
My bud is bang, I was a scholar
I knew them crisp, and couldn’t die for them blue collars
Them niggas smurkin’, they murkin’
Young nigga put a little bit of church in
Got it for my purchase
[?] worth it
They said I’m too young to be out thuggin’
Well I know it’s in my blood, cause all these niggas my cousins
Might pop a gat if you budge him
Hate him, you got to love him
Stationed out tough in public
Makin’ loud noise with the bud lip
But fuck it, tuck it, niggas still huggin’ the block
Contraband stay tucked in my sock
Compliments, they lovin’ to watch
Maybe cause it’s all in gold, and I’m out for my goal
Sold out shows across the globe, until my story is told, blue chollar
