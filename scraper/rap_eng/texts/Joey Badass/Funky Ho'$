[Intro]
Aight, fuck that, word word
Lord Finnesse, Jayo
It's been my jail since a day old, but they know
Yeah this ones for the ladies
Who be tryna have my baby

[Verse 1]
Ayo, word to my mother, two things I never do
Is leave the crib without some rubbers or tell a funky ho I love her
These broads be trying to get a brother caught up in a sticky situation
Missing menstruation cycles
They all psycho ask Michael
Before you give her dough for billie jeans and them nice clothes
Like whoa don't let them trap you on the tight rope
Spike holes in the condom to form a zygote
Overnight, ask Kwon, he know what it's like
He wore a hat but it exploded twice
But fuck a bad bitch I do this rap shit and put it over life
On the coldest nights son shine like a solar strike
And I swear I got the weirdest cases
Pipe chicks in the weirdest places from rooftops to staircases
Like get a load of their faces
Face it, if you fear, hate it, you get put into this clear space

[Hook]
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
They will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
They will never catch me slippin'

[Verse 2]
Ayo, I’m attached too, to the cash rules
'Bout to go nuts, niggas get their achoos to these cashews
Who you know that cool that they drip swagu?
And I’m here to stay like tattoos on statues
Check your mirror nigga, that’s the second time I passed you
Eating my gas fume, got me thinking like who gassed you
Your girl got gas too, she let me tackle for a dutch and a Snapple
And that's who you decide to put on shackles
I’m that dude, fuck values, pump up the volume
All up in the cut, no alcohol, just mad booze
Tryin to find a pad to bring her back to like a tadpole
I'm that folk, got bad chicks that I feel bad for
Bruising to they back bones, lickin' up my cock tip
Down to do all all no matter what the synopsis is
All it takes is some exotic piff
They all unconscious, topless, exposing they crotch and shit

[Hook]
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
They will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they could never catch me slippin'
I don't trust these bitches, they will never catch me slippin'
They will never catch me slippin'
