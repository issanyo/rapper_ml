[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I said listen: I'm just tryin' to make a livin'
Fly to the sky, lifestyle, like some pigeon
So listen to the words, that set behind this written
Cause even on the Maury show: "I ain't ever kidding"
Keep my head to the sky and my foot up on 'em clouds
The sky's the limit then I ain't ever comin' down
Said my fly like G6 and 747s
And I be raisin' Hell till I find my way to Heaven
Murder in the booth, definition of a dropped call
My presence so right that, I come in and stop all
Spittin' too much, can we send a nigga few halls
Movin' all up, so hold the U-Haul
Lil' nigga came up, 15; I snatched the microphone
Better than these dudes that got twice my testosterone
So you better show me gratitude for ? I'm tokin'
And if you fly, then you gonna see me floatin'
Futuristic shit, stuntin' in the hovercraft
Me plus a girl who really wanna do the aftermath
Cause all I can do is just laugh hahaha
Listen: laugh, laugh last; laughin at you rappers
I troop on your swag cause I'm a snack-rapper
She found out I wasn't rappin', wanted to lick the wrapper
Gave me axe instead of gifts, like I'm the gift-wrapper
So I reel her in, in like a snapper
She started to do her dance, booty-clappin' like a clapper
She started talkin' cuffing, she really started acting up
I did the ghost, and I was gone like Casper
Like my momma tell me not to mess with these hoes
I'mma tell you rookies don't mess with no Pro
So money, cars, and clothes be all a nigga knows
There ain't no lyin', I'm the truth, you can tell by my nose
Ain't no Pinocchios
And that's just how the story goes
So please stay tuned for the rest of the show
