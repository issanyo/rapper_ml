[Verse 1: Capital STEEZ]
I guess niggas ain't know that I kept patrol
So excuse me if I'm seeing shit
Thinking I ain't have no self-control
Tell her eat a dick, cause I plead the fifth
I been had steez, I don't need to spit
I keep it lit, I got a keen incense
So I ain't gonna let a nigga sneak a diss
Or even feed my bullshit when I see dissent
Still got the same pros in the background
Karma came back 'round, it's about cash now
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down
Cause I swerved with the worst of the serpents
I play determined I'm a make it worth it
Talk to him, like, state your purpose
It better be perfect if I pay for service
Momma told me to get my bread up
Drug dealers say get this scrilla
Just make sure you protect your ends and
Correct the errors, the progressive era
Never thought that bud could heal us
It got my head spinning like a double helix
Live fearless, and focus in like
Fuck your feelings, I'm above the ceiling
So one for the money, two for the women
Three for my niggas, brief intermission
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down

[Verse 2: Dirty Sanchez]
Fucking hoes with they third eye closed
And the other two's rolling backwards
Girl just drop when the lingerie
Then picture gorgeous head while I'm getting faded
I see right through hoes, it's X-rated
Her ex taken, so it's sex tapin'
Thoughts escaping, no brain cells
Pop pain pills, side effect is
That I'm erect and that she's a wreck
Got the bitch wide open like she's dissected
Accept it, more monies than your bank accounts
We going all out till we all out, bounce
Pray to this beast, though, you pray for the best
Breaking your ego, damn, you look stressed
You diss a peer and expecting respect
When you whisper my name, dog, you sound like a
It's whatever, though, I'm still in the mix
With my pros and my niggas pushing bricks, it's a work zone
47 is my number, hit my work phone
Blowing my line, riding 'round with the AC on
It's hot, gotta have patience
The best lines in the game, ain't no refunds
And since life be fun, we don't know how to act now
Pro Era, 47, came for the blackkk krown
Nigga

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Came for the black crown
Came for the black crown
Came for the black crown
Over heads like
Fresh cuts, who's next up? Next is us
So my Nexus One got text up
By exes, all types of chicks I used to "F" with, eff it
They all get passed off, get a "F" for effort
Glass jaw on records, these guaranteed smash hits
Believe that, I might drop a tape in the crash pit
Wait, we need that, it's that boom bap flow they need back
What I gotta do for a piece of pie though? I need that
But you see that broke folk with expensive taste got no
Cents but still flying to senseless places
Expensive states, I just pray that the adventure's great
Cause I'm to ignorant to read what this indenture says
I might have signed my life away today
And this road is the only
One I know back
In fact, so it's like
One for the money, two for my niggas
Three for the bitches, brief intermission
Brief intermission
Brief intermission

[Verse 4: CJ Fly]
Hope you know you're gonna be doomed when I jump in the pums
Don't wanna be smelling no fumes, so don't get it confused
Gonna get slued cooked like a stew, but I ain't, luncheon on you
Live on the edge, don't fall in love, but if you jump in it's cool
You kind of dusty, I ain't jumping the broom, like my chicks in they
Forties, cause they getting out bruise, check it
It's none to leave sumchins blue while this sumchin get blew
Gimme a loan when we're alone, ain't dumb so she gave me dome
Told me "Lick it." Said, "Bitch, you trippin', kick with your cameltoe."
And tell me how you getting home
Aw, shit, wrong hook
Fuck it, you from NY
And you don't like the Knicks, go ahead and cop yourself a dime
You get your shit authorized, and I'm a author on the rise
On the web, I'm like Peter Parker fighting crime
On the real, that's how it be as soon as I drop a line
I'm warning you, try your best to not get out of line
Why? Otherwise, find yourself in deep shit
How many feet? Six, we don't want to see you eat clips
Moon child; my fault, son, if I was blocking your shine
Flying through Heathrow , ain't hard to make a hit with the way he throw
This heat though , been so maginecto ever since a nino
Now he grown, get to see the world with his brethren them
Going all the places that you've never been ever since
First for the honeys, two for the money
Three for my niggas, brief intermission
Work, work, brief intermission
Work, work
I said one for the money, two for my niggas
Three for the bitches, brief intermission
Work, work, brief intermission
Work, work, brief intermission

[Verse 5: Rokamouth]
I'm LRG in the smoker's club
The swankest 47 member with the dankest bud
Blowing smoke right in your face, that's that reefer, love
Let you peep the blunt, and follow as I lead
You could smell me around the corner, a odor of Sour Ds
Fresh zips is all I need, re-up to live this life
It's mine, it's not a dream to do it like me
Let them haters go free, brush your shoulders off, colder than the
Realest OG, I got my goon smile on so your
Shorties could see, I been rocking these joints way
Before I was flee, and I don't know who you want me to be
I'm just another emcee with this MPC
Roka flow, let me spit so cold
These bitches would never know that I'm coming so real
Off this microphone, I'm coming right off the dome
I be spitting so real if my niggas would know
We like one for the money, two for the women
Three for my niggas, brief intermission
Brief intermission

[Verse 6: Dessy Hinds]
Light-skinned nigga, but you know I'm 'bout to black
Always got that rap that make a fan wanna come back
Got back with the boom, crack with the chuneee; leave a capital
Cause I'm about to lower your case and stack soon
Cause the cash rules subliminals thrown at you, a king
Remembered in time, remember the rhyme, give 'em the bad news
I'm that crude, roll around the city in a black suit
Who could be that smooth as shots from every angle?
The words getting tangled, and the vocals getting strangled
Treating tracks like tracks, you know they getting manhandled
Pull out the weave, too; she to cheap to
Rip 'em like a cheap root, then cheap shoot up in her free hoop
Won't stop 'til listeners catching ear masturbations
And the earwax gon' substitute for pre-ejaculation
And while we had 'em waiting for this hot shit like Cajun style
And Jamaican loud, what's the precipitation, nigga now?
One for the money, two for my niggas
Three for my women, brief intermission
Brief intermission
It go like
One for the money, two for my niggas
Three for the women, brief intermission

[Verse 7: Capital STEEZ]
Old-school fixed gear with the paint chippin'
Real nigga, now I'm used to the shape shifting
And the ones that I came in the game with
They can't give a damn cause we living in the same system
Good riddance, I kick 'em to the curb
Just so I could get the recognition I deserve
Got to keep it down to the earth
14.7 K Gold what I charge for a verse
That's sumchin, Amerikkkan Korruption
But they act like they never seen a young man
Enunciate with such words in abundance
So fuck the world and let every last nun sit
And I be the hood doctor
My true shottas got the good product
Paparazzi got to look proper
But my root chakra probably Foot Locker
Partner
That's one for the money, two for the bitches
Three for my niggas, brief intermission
King capital, came for the black crown
And the globe, so I ain't going back down
One for the money, two for the bitches
Three for my niggas, brief intermission
