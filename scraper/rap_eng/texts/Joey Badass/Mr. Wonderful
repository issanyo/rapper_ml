[Verse 1]
Call me Mr. Wonderful, but I ain't scared of none of you
Should be afraid when I'm coming through
The number one contender, far from the average pretender
Put you in a lock, you surrender
Defend your shit, don't slip
But you still real though, throw you in a grip get your elbow
Dismembered quick, hit you with the flying kicks and iron fists
Make your bones split when your dome get hit and your ligaments rip
Hit your chest like cigarettes, check the predicament
I been a threat, been at your neck, I been a vet
Go against me you won't benefit
I'll take advantage of the weak ones when they spawn
Paint a canvas when they blood get drawn
Momma should have warned you that I'm not the one
Cause they don't hold shots in this octagon

[Outro]
Enter the ring, guns blazing, guns blazing, guns blazing, my gun stay blazing
Enter the ring, guns blazing, guns blazing, guns blazing, my gun stay blazing
Enter the ring, guns blazing, guns blazing, guns blazing, my gun stay blazing
Enter the ring, guns blazing, guns blazing, I blow foes like a .44 waving
