[Chorus]
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$

[Verse 1]
I put it down in this mothafucka city-to-city
Comin' down, mothafuckas 'ready know that I'm gritty
They 'ready know that I'm 'ready flowin' from state-to-state
I'll put you out of your place, you niggas, fuckas is late
I said...

[Chorus]
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
I said
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$

[Verse 2]
Hottest mothafucka that you niggas ever seen
Walk up on the stage, niggas 'ready know it's me
[?] and I got the city [?]
Got a bitch in the cut and she know she want the D
Seen the fit, with the shits, and my niggas know I'm with it
Then I gotta get your bitch and then I get the digits
Then I fuck a bitch and then I put it in her ribs
You already know, my nigga, this is how it is

[Chorus]
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Let's go
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
Joey, Joey, Joey Fuckin' Bada$$
