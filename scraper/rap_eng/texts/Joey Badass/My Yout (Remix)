[Intro: Joey Badass & Maverick Sabre]
Yeah yeah
Badmon Ting

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
And all I've seen is clouds
Nothin' in the world gon' bring me down
Never stopped me, gettin' away, gettin' away
I'm here to better my days, better my days
And all I've seen is clouds
Nothin' in the world gon' bring me down
Never stopped me, gettin' away, gettin' away
I'm here to better my days, better my days

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Uh, just put it in the air
Light that loud and watch disappear here
Thoughts at the speed of light years, I could see the light
Yeah, this the right year made the flow yeah
Clear and easy to steer in space and time erasing fine
Amazing in the maze of clichés
Each day weighs out enlightenment
Niggas blacked out cause I got ultra violent
Now my wave lengths to the radio waves
Still keep it under pavements but not a ratio change
My patio the same, but I ain't even got to tell them that
Poppy leave them dimes at my welcome mat
Get high as heavens, hope he'll never come back
I'm like 5'11, but have angelic contact
The devil jealous in fact, Cause I rebel the spells
With a letter to god, I swear you know me so well
This one time, I said lord would you help?
Some short time after see my music on the shelf
And of course, I gotta thank myself
My wealth is in my happiness and mind
And not my pocket health in its ashes
If you don't even think sometimes
If its passion let relationships synchronize
Drowning inside her, true eyes is to the higher
I don't drink too much, I know the bud wiser

[Bridge: Joey Badass & Maverick Sabre]
It's the livest one, Bedford-Stuyvesant
Oh, Oh, Oh Oh, Hah-Yeah

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
And all I've seen is clouds
Nothin' in the world gon' bring me down
Never stopped me, gettin' away, gettin' away
I'm here to better my days, better my days
And all I've seen is clouds
Nothin' in the world gon' bring me down
Never stopped me, gettin' away, gettin' away
I'm here to better my days, better my days

[Verse 2 Joey Bada$$]
One hand on the mac, one hand on my sac
I'm thinking to myself what if I handed it back
But I gotta hand it to myself I’m handling rap
Handsome versing that’s like hand-to-hand combat
Rehearsing, I got eight arms, nigga
Disarm your favorite rapper he won’t come back
Made flex drop eight times, Nigga
On contact, rewind that like 8 times
Got to keep it G, this for my masons
Figure it out, eight times, the average amount
I may sign which I don’t like lime light
But I’ll shine witcha
Bitch, I gotta eat I might dine witcha
Yeah I got bars but I’m like Akon ouwitcha
Convict music for real
This industry give me chills
Cause in the streets I’m chill
But still heating up for a mill
I’m like so real
Life is so surreal
Sosa really got sealed for the way he revealed
Taking hold of pitchforks still
But I will never yield
In this pitchfork hold thinking I gotta appeal
Cause I'm thinking like a deal
Could get me living swell for real
But if I skyfall, thinking ideal

[Hook: Maverick Sabre]
And if the all I've seen is clouds
Nothin' in the world gon' bring me down
Never stopped me, gettin' away, gettin' away
I'm here to better my days, better my days
And all I've seen is clouds
Nothin' in the world gon' bring me down
Never stopped me, gettin' away, gettin' away
I'm here to better my days, better my days
And all I've seen is clouds
Nothin' in the world gon' bring me down
Never stopped me, gettin' away, gettin' away
I'm here to better my days, better my days
And all I've seen is clouds
Nothin' in the world gon' bring me down
Never stopped me, gettin' away, gettin' away
I'm here to better my days, better my days
