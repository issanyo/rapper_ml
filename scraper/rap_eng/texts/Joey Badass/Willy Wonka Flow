[Intro:]
Jay Oh Vee

[Verse 1]
Throw me any beat, watch me I got em'
Sniping y'all chickens [?] I spot em'
Not on the top, neither am I rock bottom
I reside in the middle right above the scrotum
Cause I always got hard thats why I be [?] at your bottom
Late [?] come up like that dude forever rotten
Red dot see your head like you poke-a-dotting
Red and green gucci, yellow chain like I'm Rastafarian(bumbaclot)
15 years of age, got your girl on the page
When I spit, not the only time I spray her face
She call me Puff Dadda, like her name [?]
First date, and I'm already hitting home base
Name not Kurt, but I wanna, before I ram
Your girl never told me no, like she Yes M'aam
I would've wifed her up, but she just a fan
And I don't eat pork, so how can I go ham(I'am allergic)
Its time to go beef, cause I be the meat that be stuck in your teeth
My lyrics in your head, stuck on repeat
I own this game, y'all just got a lease
[?] believe, my team with the wave
Get knocked over, if you misbehave
Super fly niggas, yes we well paid
You [?] the green, cause thats my maximum amount of wage
And I'm a slick and fresh nigga, thats word to La Di Da Di
Jay Oh Vee is the best, ask anybody
Roll with me or you might just get bodied
Ride the wave, or get Tsu-Tsunami'd
Have you cry, have you crying to your mommy
Choke it up, face time blue like a [?]
Have you sitting [?] like Bugatti
I cry with this beat, who give a fuck about [?]
