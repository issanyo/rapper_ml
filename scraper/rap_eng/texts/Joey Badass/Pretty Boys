[Chorus]
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl

[Verse 1]
She’s workin' 9 to 5, you're out wasting time
Brewin’ up the tea in caf's, her way to survive
You love the camera, model wannabe
Then go link another girl, hoe number 23
I bet you live for it don’t you
I bet you live off my girl’s good nature
I bet you think I was going to save you
Little boys gotta learn not to play away
Don’t pay for your phone bill
‘Cause you counting on it that next hoe will
Be a sucker
And swallow your pill
Act like an angel all for show

[Chorus]
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl

[Verse 2]
Look, I ain’t a player, I’ll just crush it, like
I don’t kiss and tell baby but I will probably hug the block
Whether you love me or you love me not
I got a whole lot a heart and never scared just to shoot my shot
But worse is gettin’ you in the courses
Now I got you trapped in my conscience like oh yeah
Doin’ was all clear 'till you got all caught up in your feelin's
Now you want to turn around and label me the villain

[Chorus]
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl

[Bridge]
You get away with it 'cause you're hot
I think it's time the pretty boys stop
You get away with it 'cause you're hot
I think it's time the pretty boys stop

[Chorus]
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl
Pretty boys, stop playing my girl
Listen, listen, listen, stop playing my girl
