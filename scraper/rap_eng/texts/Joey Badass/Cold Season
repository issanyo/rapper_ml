[Hook]
Would've thought my success would mean the best to all
Gotta connect, I could've stepped and left the rest to fall
To another cold season, and we were all dreamin'
Never thought soul demons were under my nose schemin'
My success will mean the best to all
Gotta connect, I could've stepped and left the rest to fall
Into another cold season, and we were all dreamin'

[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]
I blessed my niggas with an opt to hit me on the weekend
And what I get in return, our friend weakened
Every weekend I'm weepin'
Every time my heart makes a beat, no reason just more treason
And in the beef, but I'm no deacon
Third eye wide, so I know who's seeking and sneaking
Its like the deeper you get the more the relationship sinking
Thinking this can't be true, its hard to believe
This can't be you, you belong in the garden with Eve
We had this goal where we go, by any means necessary
But damn, I guess enemies are necessary
And its clearly imperative
I bring to the light to me, you were nothing short of a relative
I guess this is the outcome when friends get competitive
Friendships form crevasses, arguments become consecutive
Messages from label [?] moving from positive to negative
Bring me back to my competitors

[Hook]
Success will mean the best to all
Gotta connect, I could've stepped and left the rest to fall
To another cold season, and we were all dreamin'
We were all dreamin'
Never thought my success would mean the best to all, when I
Left the rest to fall
Left the rest to fall
To fall
