[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm here, here, here, here, here
Have no fear, fear, fear, fear
Yeah, it's Jay Oh

[Verse 1]
Even if I got high, I still feel grounded
I'm lower than the pavement
But the shit I been sayin'
Got me feelin' Super Saiyan
So I rise into the beat
Y'all tryin' to touch sky
I'm tryin' to catch God's feet
Little nigga spittin' flame, 500 degrees
Little nigga spit it sick, 500 disease
On some legendary shit, thinkin' I should be deceased
Like Pac, like Dilla, like Nujabes
Maybe then they can recognize, I'm better than the other guys
I'm the shit, see I attract hella flies
And I get hella fly shit up out of Bedstuy
All these new kids in rap, I'm a pedophile
Rapin' 'em, fakin' 'em, makin' 'em feel low
Rippin' 'em, flippin' em, grippin' 'em ?
But I don't give a fuck, cause I'm stepped on like pillow
But now I'm going in motherfucker, dildo
On pink, Jada, super head
No sleep, I get famous, see my eyes is super red
I be writin' rhymes 'til my motherfreakin' eyes bleed
Never backin' down, even if you rip my spleen
Flow sharp like I was spittin' up a syringe
I can see my future clear, no help to Visine
I advise them, stay away 'fore I get violent
When I spit, it's like a grip to your neck, violins
Silence, silence, silence, silence
I'm risin', risin', risin'

[Verse 2]
I never run unless I hear sirens
I'm the gorilla nigga, y'all niggas be lyin'
If I'm lyin', then you dyin'
If you're drivin', then I'm flyin'
Futuristic flow, it's still real to dough
I do eenie minie mo just to pick a flow
I see you see the other real lyricist
You niggas get smacked if you ain't feeling this
I'm killing it, sixteen, but super intelligent
You're feeling it, oh you ball, I'm stealin' it
It's my time, I'm in my prime
I would never let another person write my rhyme
It's all me, no strings, Wi Fi
I'm spaced out dawg, I belong in sci-fi
When I see my dealer I give him a high five
Then I rise, touch the sky
Like Kanye, rappers are my entree
Hey my momma, Imma big boy like Andre
Let me do it one time for my mom-ay hey, hey, hey
Since a kid, you always clean the monsters up
On Christmas, I always got my monster trucks
Now I'm going in on these kids monstrous
Well before I do, ay mom gracias
Now in I go, back to the flow
I'm just trying to find a pad, I'm a tadpole
And yeah I'm that pole so what you mad for
Got a bunch a bad girls that I feel bad for
Lord have mercy on they back bone
Blew a nigga off like you're playing saxophone
Never gave a ho the number to my phone
Don't call me ho, call Tyrone
Nigga, I'm on, I'mma drive on
Just trying to get cheese, that provalone
Middle finger to them niggas too mad at it
I flow crack, I check mad addicts
And I could never go soft it's a bad habit
JayOhVee and I'm back at it!

[Outro: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, damn
So out of breath
Feel like my lungs bout to collapse
Yo I felt that in my whole diaphram
Feel like I just ran 20 miles around the whole globe
I don't even see how that's possible but...
Around the whole globe, that's like a million miles
Whatever, let me shut up
