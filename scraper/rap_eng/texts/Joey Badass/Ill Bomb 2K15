[Intro: DJ RellyRell & Dessy Hind]
DJ RellyRell :
Turn the lights all the way down, DJ RellyRell
Haha, hahaha
You in your car, I need you to roll your windows all the way down
Turn your radios all the way up
Yo Rell, you know you are gettin that exclusive, right?)
Pro Era shit
Uh, good god, it's PE 'til the death of me, nigga
I feel like the George Jetson of this DJ shit
What, PE nigga
You other niggas Ms. Cleo with it
Know that shit, hahah
Welcome to the future my nigga, ah!

[Verse 1: Dessy Hinds]
Hand me that crown with a triple K
The AK played and y'all let it slip away
The KING still watching any specific day
Rap game plotting, never did miss a page
Still slit a stage like machete blades
So they can all witness my Hail Mary phase
Hands down to stand down ground
Crooklyn to Chi Town
Where all the black innocent niggas lie down
Then roll up dutchies in untouched money from homicide
Why kill a man when you can kill his pride?
When credit cards start to decline, uh
This the Refinement Act
Better watch y'all bread I want a slice of that
Young guns pushing militant rifles straps
Brothers on my back
Malcolm in my maps
Fulfill it to the max
Without, maximum security laps
Impurity lacks in the back of a paddy wagon in fact
Tale of the dragon and ready for action
In any old flashing rack
They ain't hashing that
They hashtagging that, so
Just hand it down if they still down for that, nigga

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
And I just want you to know something
I'm way up, don't be surprised if my nose run
Presidential sweet like check the campaign
Malia baby show 'em how we do the damn thing
I see you next time I'm out in the capital
For now we back to the murder capital
Where they murk you after school
And leave your brains on the avenue
Expect you to change, 'cause the president is back at you
Shoot, he a slave too, nigga
He promised he would change and he paid dues, nigga
But honestly theres much he can say and do, nigga
Guess the revolution, only be paper for you niggas, huh
I only state the truth, nigga
And it's way more tad if you got the jewels with ya
I be so fly, got your goose in the picture
She was trying to flock by and get loose with a nigga
And Lucifer the nigga
I should probably blame for the crusiferous, nigga
But that'd be slanted on my name
That blinding from the picture
Life was like a fast border, lord it's my picture
He said; dear son one day it's gon' switch up
'Til then I threw your front yard in the swisher
47 acres of that afghan good stuff
Every second of the hour I just get richer
Niggas get a little, probably act like Bishop
Who got the juice now? zip-up
Y'all sip lean, we sip elixirs
Got these niggas sick to the stomach like mixed liquors
Thats dark in a light like house, we field niggas

[Outro: Joey Bada$$]
Uh, Dessy Hinds, uh
Pro Era, what
Joey Bad, whats up
RellyRell, whats up
