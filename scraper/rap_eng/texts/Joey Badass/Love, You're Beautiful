[verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I can't explain exactly what I'm feeling like
All I can say is that this feelings, feeling mighty right
It's a feeling that I never ever felt before
And that way you work that dress
You're professional
I developed something inside incredible
It's my love for you girl, I had to let you know
And don't you ever think that i'ma let you go
If anything in this love thing i'ma give you more
You're beautiful from inside out and head to toe
In this love class girl
You make that honor roll
In this war of love, you my general
Had to claim you queen
And put you on the pedestal
Nothing can compare to your highness
I have seen fine ones
But baby you the finest
No matter how high the mountain
Cause girl i'll climb it
I never lose a lover
But girl i'll find it
Yeah, in like a blink of an eye
Need me
I'm there in a blink of an eye
Cause in those dark days when i'm not feeling right
You make me come out just to see the daylight
And how you make grey skies seem so bright?
And on my downest days
I gain so much height with you
In love with you(x3)
Girl cause

[hook]
Love, you're beautiful
(yeah yeah yeah love yeah you're beautiful)
I ain't never going to let you go
(nah, nah never)
Love, you're beautiful

And i'm never going to

[verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
I swear you give me reason of life
And I swear I want you to be my wife
So I can be with you every night
Girl i think i'm in love
Is this wrong or is it right
And if it's wrong
Don't even let me know
Cause I ain't trying to let you go
Girl no
I love you from the bottom of my heart
True love til death do us part
Listen
I wanna be with you forever ever ever
And I ain't trying to separate never never never
Cause on my spirit
You got the loving that lifts me up
Say girl you my treasure
What more girl can I say?

As a dude
True feelings is what I state
And for you to feel the same is what I pray
