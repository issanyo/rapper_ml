[Verse: Harry Mack, Joey Bada$$, & J Cruz)
Harry Mack, flowin' off the top of the brain
When they hear a line they know I rock it insane
It's H-Mack I'm in effect, on the ground that's where a hater laid
In the stu' with a bottle of water and Gatorade (Microphone)
H-Mack up in it, you know I rock the microphone
Yo, I ain't with them type of clones, 'cause I'm my own
It's H-Mack, I'm in my zone, y'all can't get next to me
Hey, yo, when I'm on the mike I'm charged electrically (Breakfast)
Yeah, breakfast, know that I'm reckless
Illest rapper from right here to Texas, no necklace
No watch and no chain, I flows off the brain
When I kick my lyrics all these rappers go insane (Alcohol)
I'm up in it
Sippin' on the alcohol
When you step to Harry Mack, right now you fall
We drunk off the patron shots, microphone's rocked
Harry Mack yo, on the mic my mind the 9 yes it cocked (Basketball)
Basketball, I bounce like that
Yo, Harry Mack, you know I'ma pounce on tracks
And when I'm on the mic, they can't even follow where he go
Hit a three-pointer make it look like a free throw (Power 106)
H Mack up in it, you know I got the power
We up in 106 sucker rappers get devoured
You know they should throw me up in the mix, I'm rockin' that 106, the FM station
It's Harry Mack with freestyle innovations, raw creations (Black guys)
Yeah, sittin' with a black guy
It's Harry Mack, yo, you know I'm 'bout to rap wise
One time, yo, you know I keep the flow free
And Harry Mack'll rap badass like Joey
I'm on- (Televison)
Yeah, one time with hella vision, they hella listen
I'm live up on your television
It's Harry Mack yo, I'm the freestyle fiend
Matter fact, they 'bout to show me on y'all TV screen (Venice Beach)
One time, Harry Mack yo', you know that I'm a menace with the speech
Rep from here to Venice Beach
Trump should be fuckin' impeached
And yo, can we swear I forgot to ask?
It's Harry Mack homie, I be up for the task
I rep for the coast (Mexicans)
Mexicans, Harry Mack on the mic I'm 'bout to flex again
One time, I'm the freestyle reporter
Up in LA, we headed south of the border (Government)
I'm 'bout to cross that
You know I got 'em loving it
Right now, can't really fuck with the government
One time, Harry Mack, I'm stayin' outta reach
Lyrically, I teach, Trump really need to get impeached (Lucrative)
Yeah, one time, yo, I do this, kid
And my freestyles better become lucrative
'Cause right now I ain't paid
My pockets ain't stacked
I got a little change and I'm fuckin' with that ('Billards')
You know it's Harry to the Mack
What was it? ('Billards.')
'Billards,' yo' one time I'm the rhyme killer
I'm tryin' to get that motherfuckin' shit more iller
It's Harry Mack, you know I be that Patrón spiller
Freestyle innovator, rhyme creator, no debate
The fact that I be in it, my freestyle never timid (sativa)
Sittin' next to Joey Bada$$, bout' to spark up a sativa
I'm 'bout to make a rapper a believer, yeah
I don't need that fuckin' in the couch (Chemist)
Harry Mack, when I'm in it I'ma flip it out
Yeah, one time, yo' my lyrics all be tight
And I'm the freestyle chemist like Walter White
H-Mack, in effect, I take it back
Harry Mack yo', I just be breaking bad, you know I do- (Sending nudes, sending nudes)
Sending nudes, that's something school teachers really can't do
Let me tell you 'cause I teach the kids
When it comes to freestyles yo' I do it big
One time, yeah, I like it in a girl for the sex
But I'm never 'bout to put a dick-pic in the text
It's H-Mack (Water bottles)
Sippin' out the water bottle
Harry Mack you know my freestyle is full throttle
I'm a role model if you want to learn to rhyme
And yo' it's yours for now, my turn it's mine (Mr. Robot)
Ayo, I stole it back
Yo' you know the flow hot
Harry Mack, break a dance move like Mr. Robot
Other flow come off the top, you know I punk them
Yo, Mr. Robot will never malfunction
S-s-s-s-stutter (Inhabitants)
Yo, you know I'm rapping bent
Yo, where the magic went, from this inhabitant
In Los Angeles, yo' I make the rappers jealous, sayin' shit that they can't tell us, Harry Mack I'm 'bout to swell up (Assimilate)
One time, you know that I innovate
Rap game I penetrate
All types assimilate
Bring 'em all together, yeah, I'ma make it happen
Matter fact assimilate 'em like his braids
Harry Mack, I got it made
Off the top (Pro Era, Pro Era)
