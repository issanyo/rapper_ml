[Verse 1]
Still the ugly nigga but the flow's gotten better
Hotter than a cotton sweater on a dyke rockin leather
When I drop the lever the rhymes pop in clever
Multisyllable chunks that I plot wherever
Best rhymer in a 90 mile radius
I sleep with my old baby gifts
To maintain child age and shit
Displayed a gift early but delayed the shit
Just using it as a way to get
Out the fucking creek but I ain't makin' it

[Hook]
Can't make it out the creek so I'm blazing pounds of weed
These crazy sounding dreams have me waking 'round like three
Can't make it out the creek so I'm blazing pounds of weed
These crazy sounding dreams have me waking 'round like three

[Verse 2]
The creek life is fuckin' apocalyptic
I'm duckin' a shot with quickness, expectin' a Glock for Christmas
Brains rot from sickness, plagues drop the victims
Niggas in the struggle invade shops for chicken
People dying in the street, niggas lying at ya feet
Drug dealers at the park supply ya with the heat
Good luck finding shit to eat
Surviving in the creek is unlikely for the weak
