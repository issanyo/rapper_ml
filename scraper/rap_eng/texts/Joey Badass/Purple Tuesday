[Verse 1: Rejjie Snow]
Seven years old, I asked Christ and the genie
Ten years old, I seen my friend die really
Genie in the bottle though it's Jenny on the block
I'm Houdini with the Uzi, holy father, wake me up
Time-traveller, that boy, he a star
Blowing bubbles in the faces of the people afar
'97 Hov playing, trunk rattled the car
Wet lick done licked the gold stars of my heart
Golden roses over enemies and sprinkled with serenity
Tryna stain the legacy, pray to Allah
And fo' sho', got you rappers Instagramming your ma
With that North Face jacket, blade tucked in my-
Way, way before the tomb came the womb, no question
And out came his black ass, remember, you was yellow with your
Black bandana with your fingers all twisted
June 19th '87 in the kitchen
The straw that broke the camel's back, in love with your life
Have you ever walked home afraid, alone in the night?
Have you ever taken drink inside the loo just in case?
Cause the fears of a man just like God to my cape
And the rap game crazy but the coke came at 'em
Eve came home feeling fruity and we smashing
All of that ass got me feeling real ratchet
The chicken came before the egg and way before the atoms
Cancelling the shows and making money off of acting
Rain, rain pouring like the bezels in my chalice

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
Potentially
We could build a galaxy
This you-and-I-verse could be
More than just the dreams of the living
I could see the you in me
So let's keep giving to the stars
I know that I could take you far
Far, far away from here

[Bridge 1: Jesse Boykins III & Joey Bada$$]
Where we should be
U-N-I-T-Y
Where we should be
U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity
Where we should be
U-N-I-T-Y
You and me
U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
The man rose, little concrete roads
Put your hands together, folks, for the black roach
'Bout to deliver like Stagecoach
Know I stay posted, my nigga (that was it), yo, what's the signs?
My fountain of youth is all drying, one minute, we all smiling
Then poof, we fall silent and I've been digging deep
For this thing, I ain't finding this
Either I'm insane in my brain or to be honest, that's
Probably what it is
Done seen a lot of shit that you probably can't live with
You probably can't stomach, you probably can't ingest
At times, we were so hungry, got mad dreams and wishes
It'll all get sunny, but for now it's this money that
Determines and divides, that's insuring our lives
Even causing homicides on the streets of NY
A little shawty asked me what's my purpose and why?
I told him save the children and point them right at the light
He said for sure, that's tight, but where the dollar signs in that
Them hella fine dimes with that ass so fat
That Phantom and the Maybach, that black MAC that go crick-crack
That's when I say yo, chill, shawty, relax
Let me open your mind to the current times
If visions is colourblind, it's fine, your light will still shine as
I consume this time he begin to unravel
And travel to a place he thought that he would never find, uh

[Bridge 2: Joey Bada$$]
U-N-I-T-Y
U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity
U-N-I-T-Y
U-N-I-T-Y, that's a unity

[Chorus: Jesse Boykins III]
Potentially
We could build a galaxy
This you-and-I-verse could be
More than just the dreams of the living
I could see the you in me
So let's keep giving to the stars
I know that I could take you far
Far, far away from here

[Bridge 3: Jesse Boykins III]
Where we should be
Where we should be
Where we should be
You and me

[Outro: Joey Bada$$ & Jesse Boykins III]
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta say
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta save, ayy
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta say
These are the days that we pray for love
Oh, I wonder, wonder, wonder: where is love?
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta say
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta save, ayy
What do we do? We got a duty, gotta say
These are the days that we pray for love
Oh, I wonder, wonder if it's up above
(Like that? Uh)
Like that, y'all-y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all
Y'all-y'all, y'all, y'all, y'all
