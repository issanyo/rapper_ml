[Peter Rosenberg - bridging the Junior B passing talk]
Well, the beauty is... he can live on, you know, they will both live on through your music; I mean, the fact is we all know who Ill Will is, and Ill Will died as a kid... And we all know who Ill Will is, because Nas made him live on

[Joey BADA$$]
-Word up. That's why I put his name on everything I'm involved

[Rosenberg]
Well, then get ready to give him a proper shout-out right now...
Cause what we need to do is set this thing off - We got Joey BADA$$ in the building, B4-da-Money is out Tuesday - It's real up in Hot 97 (...)

[Joey BADA$$]
Yeah, mic check uh
(Whoo!) Before the money, before the money hungry, yeah
1-20, check it out check it out yo

[Verse 1]
The ridges under my soul is full of shit, kinda like the gist of everything from most of y'all lips
You see, the cash on the other side's greener, but nowadays I feel like I gotta walk with a nina
Cause the streets got meaner, preachers got mad nice and my cousin just passed like it just swerve in any matter
Seconds minutes and hours, no to time to question the power, cause any blink'll demolish your current - is this the saga?
So I'm honored to be here today - the world is ours, we should celebrate in every way
Spread the knowledge to the youth, they tell it when we lay
Six feet, I'm six feet, standin' on my own two, and my own shoulders, it's that deep
Shift it to max beats, when I put my ego right into the back seat flowin' down my veins, runnin' tracks like a athlete
It's insane, apex rap-thletics leave 'em gassed with the aesthetics

Yeah, one-two, one-and-two, what it is? Comin' live with the kid
Yo, shout-out to my man Rosenberg, my homie down for a minute, yo check it out uh

[Verse 2]
I'm from the broke land, you can get smoked and...
New York lineage with the new ports hittin'
Breakin' new support, better hide yo childrens too, another ape loose from the Brooklyn Zoo
So watch the pigs in the blue, the jays got word from the same fake snakes that bit you too
So get loose when they peep the pump they gettin' goosebumps, it's duck season leave your roosters slump
Early in the mornin' put the wormy in the mouth, I'm from the north, but I'll make your pidgeons visit south
Back to this cheese, no time for cat-and-mouse, I trapped a spouse I'm headin' out and I'm spazzin' out...

Yeah yeah yeah yeah, uh, they can take nothing from me y'all
Yeah, before the money, aight, this is really time to go in-

[Peter Rosenberg interrupts, wants to start moderating, Joey shows disagreement]
[Beat change]

Aight... yo, yo, check it out, uh

[Verse 3]
Yeah we finna go ape shit, banana clip through your drape shit
Dressed in Bathing Ape that a fly nigga's basic, take it sellin', face it
What's my favourite line? -Give you that sour face my odour base is lemon-lime
And I'm the spotlights, the camera's, the action
Blow off top if it ain't already packed in
My flow is steady tight, heavy like Iron Fist, Dead Or Alive
Been ready like Biggie back in 9-6, and I already died, steady rise
Touch the sky, kiss God, learn to fly, and then I came back alive
Fucked around, then did it twice, this is truly my third life
About to turn 20, but I'm goin' on a 105
My soul is wise, filled with wisdom of a older guy, so when these little niggas talk why would I reply?
I hold the light(n)ing, truly you're the one to fight, I break necks and smash faces, just off the flow and them cadences
All my shoes in the hallway but don't know what patience is
You know I spit it hot like where Satan is, and you already know what the fuck the station is
So keep it locked cause my niggas feel gon' make you big
From the top, but we're comin' for your nation, still on that world domination tip
Yeah, comin' for that crown and your queens, she just comin' for the sake of it, yeah she love a nigga with jeans enough to take a flick
Uh, exposin' that clip with a face in it
And truly, I can end your life today with one click, nobody fuckin' with my squad, nigga name one clique
Fuck these niggas talkin' 'bout I'm lackin' the bars, nigga got so high they started shootin' at stars
Comin' for the rap game, practicing my aim, who got an issue with this view? -I can blow your brains out
Uh, I'm tryna eat right now, a stand out nigga beneath a seat right now
And I can't bear to find no peace right now, my nigga STEEZ said it's time to release the beast right now
Uh, so that's what I'm about to do, you say you're comin' for my plate? -Cool, you know you fool
Don't step into my lane, dawg you gon' get chewed, and I don't fuck with this rap game, I don't go by the rules, boy
Uh, I'm from the school of the hard knocks, where niggas get dropped if they violate yo' block
All the OG's gon' be passed away, that's why the rap game run up on the cats today
I'm a rap god and this is blasphemy, I just might be the next one just to pass away
It's either that or the torch gettin' passed to me

[Rosenberg being more careful this time]

Hold on, I think I got one more
I only got so far in my texts

[Verse 4]
Muthafucka, it's the J-O-Z-I-F-B-A-D-M-O-N, come on, bring the menz on in
I'm on the upside now, you can turn the menz upside down, we 'bout to win
It's a L for the other side of him, most brains that you lost, I invite 'em in
Know you feel the vibe when I'm all channellin', the innermost of my soul has been agrow for plenty gold
But most of them labels don't pay me, so...
Who you think investin' in them penitentiaries tho? -Same owners of the labels, same owners of your cable
Spoon-feedin' you fables, tryin' to keep yo' mind stable, yo' eyes blindin' yo' skin's hazel
The truth's under ya nazel, but even the air's all fucked up - how we supposed to see stars with chemical trails above us?
Plus some other shit that's undiscovered, detached from the roots since we set sail, my brothers
That's word to motherland, sowed us on stolen land, visions from brother man, we seen us all holdin' hands
Fifty years later still see my brothers choke to death, R.I.P. to Eric Garner, only right I show respect
Nowaday they hangin' us by the same tree, the branches of the government, I can name all three:
Judicial, Legislative and Executive, lock your pops away, trap your moms and next the kids, it's all consecutive
I'm just tryna break the cycle, I wonder if I do it all before they take my life, yo
Crucify my image, the Lord is my witness, if them Heaven's Gates is closed I'mma break off the hinges for my niggas
Yes, I'mma break off them hinges for my niggas
