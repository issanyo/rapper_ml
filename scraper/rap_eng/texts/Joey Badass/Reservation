(Dessy - Intro)
Yeah (ha), Welcome to the masterpiece (ha)
Alright, We're near all this perfection
For straight entertainment purposes (ha)
Flow crazy, Yeah, Look

(Dessy - Verse 1)
Uh, who'd of thought I would be rappin?
Dessy packed with more shit than you going camping
Work hard first, Later, vacay in the Hamptons
We just tryna get bread, No rolls or sandwich
No I ain't vicious, But somehow I do damage
Year after year, My flow had to gain a standard
Standing in the booth, Sound-proof, spittin' truth
Now its sharper than you
In a job interview with a suit
Too smooth for an intro, But if I think of something
Y'all the first ones I'mma let know
Just like you getting fired
With my flow, I'mma let go
Niggas ain't hot, boy I'm hot
And yet in the snow
How far are you willing to roll
Just to get a record deal
I would cross the globe
Even if I was in heels
5-star meals for our 5-star deal
Now I'm costly
Cost me some five car ðŸ‘†bills, like (ha)

(Hook)
And we gon have a celebration
I'm in the studio, under no hesitation
After I'm done, it's a grand elevation
Get us a reservation, get us a reservation

Chorus
Like please, uh, get us a reservation (3x)
Like please (4x)

(Joey)
Jay-Oh, look, uh
I see the best when I look up in the mirror
And I apply Windex to see my future clearer
Cause' my crystal ball, it don't look too crystal
I'm goin' off like a white man pistol
When they see a nigga reachin' in his pocket
Like "he got a gun and I know he gon pop it"
All he really has is a dollar and a dream
Too late for these shots, finna knock a nigga clean, like
This world, it can't be genuine
We get knocked for the color of our melanin
Only treated the same, in a skeleton
If you ain't get that line, I advise hit rewind
But let me stop, before I get too hyped up
Stop playing dog, get your girlfriend wifed up
Cause' I don't know why, shorty keep pagin' me
I must say, she sweat a brother majorly

(Hook+Chorus)


Ha ha, yo this is the masterpiece
Yeah, this is the masterpiece
Ah Ha Ha, this is the masterpiece
Alright, this is the masterpiece
This is the masterpiece, this is the masterpiece! (2x)

(Hook 2x)

(Chorus 2x)

(Hook)
