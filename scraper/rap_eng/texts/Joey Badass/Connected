Ayo in the same city B.I.G screen
Chasing paper the same color as the c’s team
No matter where I’m at on the map I bleed green
Whole clique got dry skin we need cream
Was on them streets eager to make the gatts warmer
They told me I’d be much better as a rap performer
Getting hype on them tracks than on them crack corners
Because cops will put mics on your back on rat on ya
Getting your weight up feens you slinging death too
No you getting your weight you in the rec room
Hitting them sets wishing that you could jet soon
May come around you ain’t going home till next June
Go ahead keep scrambling for pennies
Imma do this rap till they hand over the benji’s
Enough talk about you handling a semi
We know ain’t no tucking them hammer in them skinnys

Push!
Don’t ask me both no rappers
Cus I don’t know no rappers
All these live niggas with me about they business nigga no actor’s
We ghost busters soul snatchers
Put cheese on yo ham motherfucker yeah gold packets
Got bad table manners wave toast at ya
Fuck etiquette when it’s predicate
Get resident evil for dead presidents
People gloves on lover letter my eagle
And I can make the pelican fly I’m text my people
I still got the work you want it come Holla fam
I’m talking coke prices the port as hot as gram
You can get it by the gram still getting blow off
Till static call me to the studio to show off
Yo easy this is easy money

Wais P

Imma kill these birds fuck if they call P.E.T.A on me
Call P.E.T.A matter of fact call the animal shelter cuz I’m using full length minks in the winter for shelter
You ain’t get the memo I put holes in your lemo
Or you can pay what you owe and I put holes in your memo
Wais P the pimp ya’lls niggas is trash receptacle rapping garbagé
Chain swing wrist dancing when the light shine pinky ring in talking with my hands like It’s fuck time
Watching she buy a pimp a house shit she gonna blow me anyways m
Ight as well put her money where her mouth is ha
Ten thousand on the outfit two hundred on the car I ain’t a fraud come check ma garage
I’m living large I ain’t got lie to rap hard
I just live my like then I put it bars
Musical massage menagerie fanatically giving you my reality
And I ‘all never lose battery bitch
Joey Bada$$

Ooh you gotta see him from blue collar season
Now he done blew and he at the coliseum
Niggas wanna be him among supreme beings
Want a box last summer now niggas wana be him
That’s progress but the bmf process in not census
Everything not cents
Tell di bwoy dem dem can’t contest
I’m I’ll behind the bars you don’t know what’s on the card chest
Don’t need to take no shots to kill
A inner city nigga who faking his spot
Tell the truth these niggas is just chasing twat
I rise to the top like jamaican locks
Let the hating stop they can never do that
Young prodigy came back to show you how to do rap
