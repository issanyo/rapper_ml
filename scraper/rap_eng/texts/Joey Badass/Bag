[Verse]
Might lose my balance but my cup is never spilling
What the future hold? It ain't no telling
I made a couple millions so I'm chilling
What more can I say? (?)
My legacy (?) for all my children
I put water on my daughter, make it splash
It's like she just can't grow up any fast
Finally found something to do with all this cash
I made my duffel, baby need a bigger bag
