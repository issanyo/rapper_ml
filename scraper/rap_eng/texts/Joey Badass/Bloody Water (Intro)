[Intro]
{Gunshot} Damn, niggas always wanna be shooting and shit... it’s a damn shame

[Verse 1: Monte]
What you finna rap about? You never sold crack out ya’ house or put a gat to a mouth, just a kid with a normal ass past, ain’t killed a nigga before or slang that dough, hyper active kid with a massive mind didn’t fucking like to fight ‘Cause I was the passive kind

[Verse 2: Monte]
Twice upon a time there was a boy who died, but that’s another chapter, ‘cause in reality it ain’t no happily ever afters, I ain’t come from that silver spoon lifestyle or them slums where the killers stay, I was born tryna make a way, in order to pay respect, you gotta pay dues, and if you don’t pay ‘em on time then you might end up on the news

[Verse 3: Joey Badass]
Yo, shout out to all the bad bitches with the wagons on ‘em Like to hit it from the back with the Magnum on me Grip, just in case she try to let a nigga slip Uh, never trust a bitch You can try your luck, I’m gettin’ fired up Mami talking to me crazy like she fuckin’ wired up So I took it out my pants and her hands went right on up Drop that shirt off where you standing, step right on up Need ya give me what I need and Get down on your knees and Tell me "Lord Joey, you the one that I believe in" If you move fast then I just might start squeezin’ Bust it in your mouth piece til you’re not breathing But enough of that shit, let’s get where the cream is Young and ready for action and baby girl’s a genius So surrender the booty girl, it’s your last chance That’s when she says, “your wish is my command” and I’m the man understand, yup
