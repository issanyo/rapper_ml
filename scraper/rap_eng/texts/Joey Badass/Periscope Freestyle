[Intro]
That's my shit
You got it going on, what what
You got it going on, what what
You got it going on baby, what what
You got it going on, what what
Wassup, yeah

[Verse]
A nigga been trying to fuck with you
Since the first time we kissed it felt comfortable
Didn't wanna let go upon my trust in you
Now everyday I'm thinking 'bout what's up with you
Every time my phone ringing I'm praying it's you
Nothing else I'd rather do than be hanging with boo
Smoking blunts on the roof, lay under the moon
Taking shots of the Henny and run in your room
Now we kissing and touching and setting the mood
Baby tell me where you want it and I'm making a move
Chemistry mixed smooth like we in a bruise
Started out as just friends, now we in a duo
When our energies collide, impeccable vibe
Inevitable, we aligned, a matter of time
'Til I can feel your warm skin pressed against mine
Until then I just can't get you out my mind
I sing this all the time

[Outro]
Whoo
Yo this shit gon be hard
Every day I'm, aye aye ayee
