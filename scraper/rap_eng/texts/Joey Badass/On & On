[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, momma I just booked a first class ticket
To my destiny by the way, yeah

[Refrain: Maverick Sabre]
Maybe I'mma fly away
Maybe I'mma fly away, some day

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Yeah, so gullible just like my first love
Stay humble, but I knew that I was first up
Picked up the pen, and that's when I drew my first blood
Spill my heart again, cause the pain'll never end
Happiness is temporary, always has been
I just lost one, but sometimes I win
I always spread love, but sometimes I sin
I only trust some, that’s why I keep a few friends
Funny cause I used to see my circle never end
Always kept like 47 friends in my circumference
All that’s left now is the radius
They still here, trying to find love on this atmosphere
Things get severe for everybody, everywhere
This is my moment of truth, right here
Swear I ain’t scared of no man, I see the omens
I pick 'em up and keep it rollin'
The omnipresence is omnipotent
But I keep going, 'til it’s all said and done
I show all my soul purpose but I’m pretty sure there's one
There’s a reason why I’ve come, new season's just begun
This the death of a psychopomp but a birth of God's son

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
I had a dream I seen my name on the gravel stone
And read here lies a G followed by a poem
I couldn't see the words but I'm sure what's in his own
Funny that I write most when I know my feeling's wrong
Went with both shoulders that my head is always on
I charged through harm's way, carry boulders on my arm
I feel strong as I walk through the many storms that
Rain on my parade, seen the doves cry for days
I'm feeling like a young prince, I'm drinking today
My name ring bells all the way to heaven's gates
Though STEEZy told about me, yo I know he always watching
I guess there really is a heaven for us hip hoppers
I really miss my partner
But I know he with Big Poppa, 2Pacs and the Big L rolled proper
And that's a big pun, know that I'mma join him
When my time come, but the story just begun

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

[Refrain: Maverick Sabre]
One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)

[Verse 3: Dyemond Lewis]
Let's just go...
My clouds gray, I hope my pain don’t show
Looking in the sky I wonder where them rainbows go
They say that if we reign, them pot-of-gold’s will show
Even skating down the block don’t feel the same no more
If I ain’t looking, I still see it all
My vision’s jaded, too much bitches rubbed the crystal balls
They stay scheming, y’all like the sheep to the shepherd
The trees to the leaves, you need but not needed
So I work alone, lone wolf, stay creeping
I'd rather hunt on my own then be owned and not eating
I’m not eatin’, not blamin’, I’m just sayin’
Go to bed with hunger pains while these other niggas caking
They too fake
No rappers rapping for years waiting 'round for that big break
Break a arm, break a bond before I go break the bank
Break a hundred, that's fifty-fifty as long as Rawle eatin' wit me
Seen different cities, different titties, all with no money with me
I'm on my grind man, no regrets when I die man
'Til we fly man, 'til we fly man, 'til we fly man
You gon' miss us when we fly man

[Chorus: Joey Bada$$]
So don’t mourn me when I’m gone, celebrate my travels
Whenever you need me, just take a plane to the astral zones
I’m headed home, I’ve been hurting too long
Time don’t stand still, so you gotta move on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, and on and on, and on and on
And on, yeah

[Refrain: Maverick Sabre]
One day I'mma fly away
One day I'mma fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day you will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
One day we will fly away (Fly away, fly away)
