As I slide right through that clitoris
Got yo' bitch hooked, just like this chorus
Bustin' a third out, wonder where your whore is, gorgeous
Goldilocks you like poor rich
Bitches ain't be loyal couldn't afford the rent
So I give em big dick like it's cummin' since
Seen the thing they drop it down, money time is spent
If you ain't fuckin' then you got to go, baby don't waste my time
Been fuckin' on the low, do her man know, that business ain't mine, uh
Pass it to mi hermano in her spinal
She scratched me up like the vinyl

Swankin' my whole life nigga, know I'm talkin' 'bout

Instrumental 2: "No Flex Zone" by Rae Sremmurd
[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
All my life I been around crips and bloods
[?] trigger happy [?]
Claim the slums and all the hoods that they from
Too much of the sum, gotta twist it up
Wind it in the rat race, cash straight, the fate til' [?], the stake is too late, my [?]late
And I can see your mind strafe
Comin' at me sideways, straighten up
Don't face your luck, give me the buck
My cash raker went up, uh uh
Lookin' back in the days amazed, 'cuz the lab rat done made it out the maze
[?] feel pain, the rage, no
Use the underground rail road like the runaway slave
Broke off your chain still runway fresh
Got you on the mental plane with my project jet
Two steps above that, nimbus cloud, my limits is now
Gonna smoke it on the loud, hookahs in it now
When the lotus is around, [?] the [?] sounded profound
Why you will be proud about
I don't need events to even shout me out
Pac-a-pac-a-Pacquiao, can't box me out
Yeah, yeah
No flex-tion, No flex-tion
