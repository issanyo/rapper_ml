[Verse 1: Joey BADA$$]

One, two, three, four
I said it's one, two, three, four
I got one, two, three whores
And they all gotta fuck me tonight
Show you what's it's like, pass me your life
Pass me the mic so I can free my mind, so I can free my soul, so I can free my spirit
But these niggas won't hear it, talkin' 'bout I am at the top of the pyramid with a pair of mids

[Verse 2: Kirk Knight]

Like, "My nigga I ain't hear it"
Let me spit bars for some clearance
Clearin' up my mind and my chakaras just fine
And my way through this life and it's
Yo, hold up
Chillin' in the bed for a minute
Fuck every girl cause you know I'm always in it
Now a nigga hittin' all that type of shit that a nigga was tryin' to live in this past life, like

[Verse 3: Joey BADA$$]

Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with
Lethal lyrics, see through your heart and I see your spirit
Said these niggas don't get my drift
They can't drive with me, can't get this shit
Said they can't keep up smoking reefer, that's what my teacher said
I would never be cool
Y'all went to high school, I went to school high
Still gettin' with the cool life

[Verse 4: Kirk Knight]

And um, I'm high again
Hi again, you can bring a friend
I said super duper maniacal snooper
Man with the king jeweler, what a stooper
Man with the bada bling, came with the ???
Everybody said that he look like King Koopa
And if I keep rappin' bars kinda super, everybody said that Kirk is super
Now a nigga got bars for a minute
It don't really matter cause a nigga been in it
Incarcerated bars, killin' the ???
It don't really matter cause a nigga was just in it

[Verse 5: Joey BADA$$]

Incarcerated stars
All I do is plan to go far
So all really do is work hard, spit these bars
Don't really bathe so he got no bars
