[Intro]
Yeah
Soy el fuego que
Soy el fuego que

[Hook]
I need all my bad mamis, front and center
It's a movie scene when I enter
Better get your man if he sentimental
If you don't get the memo I'm sending metal
'Cause we ain't just letting off on instrumentals no mo'
We ain't just letting off on instrumentals no mo'

[Verse 1]
Lil' Spanish mami, young Mexicana
Fed her white lies, no Betty Blanca
Took one hit and it mesmerized her
Shorty tryna get me lined by the Federales
Dammit I love it when she talkin' sloppy
Give me toppy and call me papi
Whisper that freak shit all in my ear though
Me gusta mami, y yo quiero
That pussy make a nigga tip his sombrero though (Damn)
She ain't fuckin' niggas with no dinero no (Yeah)
That's my chica, señorita
Mi niña, yo necesito
Mira, mira, she muy bonita
I need to see her, I need to see her

[Hook]
Need the bad mamis, front and center
It's a movie scene when I enter
Better get your man if he sentimental
If I don't get the memo I'm sending metal
'Cause we ain't just letting off on instrumentals no more

[Verse 2]
Got this little bad Rican, she love the freakin'
Need to see me at least twice a weekend
What's the skin tone? Butter pecan
Made me drop my old hoes I don't need to see 'em
I don't even need 'em
¿Como estás, papi? Muy bien
I'll be on el avión while you prolly home
And you still fuck around with them maricónes
Young Gustavo, smoke Cubanos, out in Cabo with the next top model
Feelin' like a nigga just hit the lotto
I'm so up high, I'll be smoking on hydro
Plus she loyal, suck and swallow
After that it's arroz con pollo
Picture perfect don't take a photo
That pussy worth to make a fly solo

[Hook]
Need the bad mamis, front and center
It's a movie scene when I enter
Better get your man if he sentimental
If you don't get the memo I'm sending metal
'Cause, we ain't just letting off on instrumentals no more
We ain't just letting off on instrumentals no mo'

[Outro]
I need all my bad mamis, front and center
Shake that thing for me when I enter
Better get ya man if he sentimental
If you don't get the memo I'm sending metal
'Cause, we ain't just letting off on instrumentals no mo'
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Soy el fuego que
Soy el fuego que
Jozif Badmon
Representing
Peace to the world
Yeah yeah
Soy el fuego que...
