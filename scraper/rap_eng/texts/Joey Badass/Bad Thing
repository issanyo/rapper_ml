[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Come fuck with a pro
Bad thing, bad thing
What you saying mama

[Verse 1: Kiesza]
Tougher than a leather goose
I wanna say your last name
You ain't playin' by the rules
But you gon’ change the whole game
I don’t wanna suit and shade that cool
While until the love again
Danger when you make me ooh
But I think that’s a good thing

[Hook: Kiesza & Joey Bada$$]
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
I’mma fiend for that thing, that thing
Oooh

[Hook: Kiesza & Joey Bada$$]
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
I’mma fiend for that thing, that thing
Oooh

[Verse 2: Kiesza]
I don’t want to ever choose
Keep it jumpin' like a trampoline
No matter what you put me through
You always make it worth it
We go together me and you
Reebok's and a hoop chain
Enough to make me say I do
And I think that’s a good thing

[Hook: Kiesza & Joey Bada$$]
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
I’mma fiend for that thing, that thing
Oooh

[Hook: Kiesza & Joey Bada$$]
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
I’mma fiend for that thing, that thing
Oooh


[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
But in conclusion, it's only time we losing
We get deluded by these illusions, constant confusions
And every movin', any time that we doin'
What could be a great duet
Gets neglected, feel my solar plexus tryna get you back babe
Tell me where it's at, where it's at, at, at
Gotta pack of that yack, yack, yack
That'll probably snap that back
Hit the cat till it's cataracts
But you like the sound of that
Now bring it back, we the perfect match to start a culture, might start it happen
Don't get too attached, cause I adapt to change quick see
My way of livin' fast, be on my switchin' lanes shit
You're sick of all that anguish, cause you know how that game get
If you ain't speaking that dollar bill, then you ain't speaking that language
I'm, dancin' with this little devil
I, condescend when usually I'm on a higher level
Sip a little Red Bull
Now we growing wings, she's the girl of my dreams
I could, give her my last name but that's a bad thing

[Hook: Kiesza & Joey Bada$$]
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
I’mma fiend for that thing, that thing
Oooh

[Hook: Kiesza & Joey Bada$$]
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
Maybe that’s a bad thing, bad thing
I’mma fiend for that thing, that thing
Oooh
