[Intro]
Action

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
05' pounds in the Laredo, they gotta get there today though
Ain’t no time for tryna lay low, bay bro
If you can’t do it all you gotta do is say no
I’ll take it from there, Ace is on Grand ready to work it
Displayed a smirk like Mr. Perfect
Under the bridge, behind the van, in the cab, I made the drop off
Thank science that nothing popped off, since I was young, had a lust for foreign vehicles and things
My father wore the ring when he pushed me in the swing
Plus he pushed that red thing, I wanted to be like him so bad
Wear the same shoes that he stepped in, of course I need paper
I want to ride the one-seater like speed racer
In the Jetta smoking a one sheet in the green acres
Listening to bullshit music, thinking how I’m gonna do this

[Hook: Rico Love]
Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
I’m from a place called the jungle where the living is rough
It had me low for a while now I’m picking it up
Holding the spot straight sticking it ripping it up
I dropped 99 problems, switching and not giving a fuck
So what you what you want? Got your bitch nigga gripping her butt
Her and my dick, taking pics nigga flicking it up
My click is wassup get buck if you want?
You end up dumped chump, in the pond lake in a truck in New York
There’s no ducking me, the Bada$$ time, but no fuckery
Won’t find a chick who got a dime or take a single buck from me
These hoes be loving me, I keep it so G
Respecting where I be nigga check your OG
My rap flow, imperial fad flows
Well here it go my, visions is linear when I’m ripping the video
It’s a lyrical miracle when I enter your stereo
The rarest breeds, sick like venereal diseases

[Hook: Rico Love]
Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on

[Bridge: Rico Love]
Dying for nothing
Killing to live, fighting for something
Too bad we don’t know what it is
What you think all of this cash for?
Trying to put stamps on my passport
Man I’m just scheming on new hoes
I already forgot about my last broad

[Hook: Rico Love]
Uh, temptations real
Even though we feel we’ve been here before
Somebody help me
Lord have mercy
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
But what about the rest of us?
What about the rest of us?
Screaming, somebody help me
But what about the rest of us?
It’s like the world we live in was only designed for
Somebody wealthy
Turn the lights on
