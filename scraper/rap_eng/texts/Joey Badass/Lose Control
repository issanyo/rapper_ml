[Intro: Joey Bada$$]
Hey!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Bitch, I'm a bad man, fuck with the Badmon (yeah)
Bitch, I'm a bad man, fuck with the Badmon
Hmmm

[Verse: Joey Bada$$]
I'm lit, you litter, not more lit man something we get rid of
And I never been a swimmer
So how'd this little nigga made his way, through a motherfucking mainstream river?
All on my lonely, I'm a lone shark bitch
Better have my money, she can keep the heart if not
Then I'm coming to the spot to rip the bones apart
Bet you won't believe my mark with the Bonaparte
And, they can never question my pen
That's a motherfucking death sentence my friend
With the pen for real, the balls of steel
Yeah, show me which one of y'all are for real
All you niggas just charm or something?
And your lady friend gonna rip my garments up
Hook around and get them unpopular
With it close on every floor get to popping stuff
Oh lord, coming for the highest powers
On god got respect for my rasta man
Oh ja big fat chocolate bar that's on the law
The devil is a lie, and I don't fuck with the law
The law, gotta keep it gold
Putting on for my city, putting on for my bro
Make one false move gon' ram it up
Joey Bad and Glass Animals
So let's go

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt (Bout to lose my brain!)
Nobody move, I said nobody get hurt (I'm screaming!)
Nobody move, nobody get hurt (Bout to go insane!)
Nobody move, I said nobody get hurt

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Come take a walk through my mental, let's talk, what interest you?
I tell you all the essentials, just please don't be judgemental
And don't expect, just continue, to accept what I give you
Trust is not detrimental, just what you been exempt to
Okay, let us begin, strolling down memory lane
Siphon right by that gym, I been straight flowing for days
Scraping pennies for change, of living in better way
(Scream)
The sky's been blue a lot, but my booze been heather grey
I got this heater today, can't wait to let the bitch go
I got some problems, my man, that I can't tell one soul
So please, just watch what you say
I be that baddest mofo
I tell her lose control
I'm 'bout to lose control

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, I said nobody get hurt (Lose control!)
Nobody move, nobody get hurt (yeah)
Nobody move, I said nobody get hurt
(Scream)

[Bridge: Dave Glass Animals]
Now I'm feeling all this dope
Spinning out I'm drinking through this cup
Tripping out I'm sitting on the cusp
Something I don't think I'm one
I'm on fire
Lose control, 'bout to go insane
'Bout to lose my mind, playin' this old game
I'm so sick and tired of the crazy law
And this crazy place, but I don't wanna give it to you
Lose control, where you go insane
And you lose your mind, playin' your game (lose control)
And you're sick and tired of the crazy law
And this crazy place, I don't wanna give it to you
(Scream)

[Outro: Joey Bada$$]
That man is a bad man, so don't you try
That man is a bad man, that man is a bad man, so don't you try
That man is a bad man, Badmon is a bad man, so don't you try
That man is a bad man, Badmon is a bad man
Yeah!
