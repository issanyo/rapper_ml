[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
I got, the perfect kinda love, brother and sisterly bond
And if it wasn't written, then I'mma put it in song
Just move along to the words and the melody
Let you rock your mic if ya' know what you're telling me
All the right verbs, it curves it so heavily
I'm so in love in what you could do potentially
Talkin' to you mentally and stalkin' you on everything
I'm even thinkin' wedding rings, movin' onto better things
It's crazy, cos I ain't never feel this way before
And if I did, baby I can't recall
And that just how I feel right now
Let a nigga disrespect, I swear I kill right now
My ride or die forever, she down to roll whenever
Rain, sleet, snow, whatever
It don't matter the weather
Whether it's tank tops or fleek leathers, imagine polo sweaters
Cruisin' together 'til death come and get us
I got

[Hook]
Nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby

[Verse 2: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Go figure
You love a nigga even though I get no bigger
You piss me off sometimes
But that's how life is sometimes, guns with no triggers
Your momma hate me around cause I'm nothin' like the nigga that she had in mind for you
We used to fight all the time, now you're like one of my best friends

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I'll never forget the night you took me to you're crib and you didn't let me go home
You took me in your room, laid me in your bed and told me hold you close
Because of where we were as friends, I was tryna' say "oh no"
But ever since that day, you're my homie lover baby and I got

[Hook]
Nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby

[Verse 3: BJ The Chicago Kid]
Never a gold digger
So cool, we cracked jokes cos you got no nigga
You piss me off sometimes
You talk a lot when you off that wine like yo' nuts bigger
You hospitable, fuckwitable' and unfuckwitable' at the same time
Baby girl and that first night stays on my mind

[Bridge: BJ The Chicago Kid]
I'll never forget the night you took me to your crib and you didn't let me go home
You took me in your room, laid me in your bed and told me hold you close
Because of where we were as friends, I was tryna' say "oh no"
But ever since that day, you're my homie lover baby and I got

[Hook]
Nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
I got nothin' but love for you baby
Sometimes you piss me off and yeah you drive me crazy
But still I got nothin' but love for you baby

[Outro: Hannibal Buress & BJ the Chicago Kid]
You know I love you
Because you were there whenever I needed you
Whenever I was down and out, you were there
No matter what time I would call
It would be five in the morning, and you'd show up
I could be drunk, high, my place would be messy as fuck
I be all fucked up at my worst
And you would come around
You would show me love
And that's why I love you
That's why I got nothin' but love for you
Ayo H, what's her name man?
I'm talking bout' the 24 hour delivery spot by my place
Man I'm out, I ain't fuckin' with you
Wait
Ay BJ what's this song about again?
I think I messed up, alright
