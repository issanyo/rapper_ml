[Verse 1: Skeeter Fergie

That's My Word Like Sunoco

Ready To Snap , Head For The Cheese
So Here's The Photo , Its All Show
Spanish Chick Back For It , She a Loco
Young Cats Tryna Copy These Old Flows , So Fix This
Flash With The Mac , You Slackin , Nigga Call It Lipstick
These Chickens Ride Till They Cocked , And They Get Popped In a Block Of Niggas
Bein' Foul In The Game , So They Get Flopped
And I Make Side Rappers Contact Drops , Killer In Ya Eyes
Ya Contact Shot , Bitch I See Goal , You Seagulls So Go Flock
Call It Martyr , In Harlem And Skeeters We All Sportin Nuttys Like George Carver
So I Carved Her Outta The Space , She a Martian
Pain To a Water , A Gi-Na , Like Martin
45th And 3 Line , Lay Tracks Like a D Train
I Let You Be The Shit , Yea Nigga You Shit Stains
My Bitch Bangs , Take You To Jungles Dirty Kitchen
Im Cancer , Worst Spot Of Me I keep It Sickened
You Hear My Buzz , Im Not Beasting , Im Just Feasting
Right Here Im The Answer , Why You Keep On Cheating ?
X Marks The Spot , Shabazz Nigga Im Leading
Bitches On My Wood And Good , I'll Be Here Light Years
Ambidextrous , You Thought You Left Me But I'm Right Here
See Me In The Middle , I B E On CD's , Lenox Ave On Top , Cause Nigga You On V Street
A Classic , Paid In Full , Juice , Shottas , Blocka , Next Thing Is Common Urban Sinatra
Bloodclot , Hit You With 4 Shots In Ya Casa , Door Not , Hit You 4 Shots In Ya Casa
