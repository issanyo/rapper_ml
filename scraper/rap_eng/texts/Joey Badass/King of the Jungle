[Intro]
Yo Biggie!
What up, son?
What up, son?
Yo! Yo, drop that shit!

[Sample (Notorious Big)]
Is Brooklyn in the house?
Is Brooklyn in the house?

[Chorus]
Iron fist
Stuck in the lab like a scientist
Killin' everything in my environment
I ain't the one
One

[Verse]
I'm Brooklyn borough thorough
King of the jungle now they all in trouble
Six years strong they can't knock the hustle
I'ma be here long on some rap Rapunzel shit
Stay close to where I stack my bundles
We'll get a paper cut anytime my tongue'll lift
I talk sharp, please don't start with the Don
Guarantee to never do me no harm
I could teach you to raise a army of guns to bust for me
Palmin' the napalm, and then drop in the bars calmly
Throw dirt on my palms hardly ever
If I let her bite the fingerprints off of my Gucci sweater
Fuck you know about this boss shit, big talk shit
I spark big spliffs, the shots I call it
Niggas ain't got bars, they non-alcoholics
I raise the bar so high, that I'm getting brolic from all this
Look, flows is polished, foes demolished
I was raised in them neighborhoods so impoverished
Now I get a little taller when I stand on my wallet
And I bought tracks with the late, great Christopher Wallace
I'm a hip-hop scholar, graduated with the young god honors
And the wisdom and the knowledge from all of my forefathers
I pay homage, only right I keep this shit honest
High-level shit, they call me your highness bitch

[Sample (Notorious Big)]
Is Brooklyn in the house?

[Chorus + Sample]
Iron fist
Stuck in the lab like a scientist
Killin' anything in my environment
I ain't the one that you niggas should be trying with, ya heard
Is Brooklyn in the house?
Iron fist
Stuck in the lab like a scientist
Killin' everything in my environment
I ain't the one

[Sample (Notorious Big)]
Is Brooklyn in the house?
Is Brooklyn in the house?
Is Brooklyn in the house?
Is Brooklyn in the house?
