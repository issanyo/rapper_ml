[Intro]
Badmon representing
Tell me is you ready is you really ready
They ain't really ready they ain't never ready
I was born ready now I'm coming heavy
Now I'm coming heavy

[Hook]
I hope you ready, cause its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping everytime I'm stepping out
And if you step outside your face we pop up right in front of your house

[Verse 1]
Niggas think because we conscious we don't really get it popping
They forgot we from the bottom
They forgot we had to fight for every nickel, every dollar
Before the money and the power
You could ask my nigga Powers I've been putting in these hours
Plotting domination now the whole world is ours
Tell me why they hating, its cause of what I'm making
And if you a little patient its gon' be what I'm taking
They got me mistaken
Critics try to box me
I feel like Rocky when it come to paparazzi
Somebody stop me, fucking up my kamikaze
I'm on my 47 shit, like how could you not see
Cause we dropping jewels I said we dropping jewels
Temper rising cools prolly see me on the news
Joey got the juice, finally got this nigga loose
Now while I'm free to speak free my nigga Shmurda too
I'm feeling like Victor Cruz a giant from New York
I'm lacing up the boots then I'm going fucking long
So if you trying to score just pass it to me more
Never dropping the ball, always raising the bar

[Hook 2]
Man it's gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now
All these others niggas thinking they from the south

[Verse 2]
Bitch I'm the bomb even HOV said it
Though I never signed to ROC and no I don't regret it
You know I'm coming for the top you see me getting bigger
How can you sign if you know you're tryna beat a nigga
When I made it to his office I was seventeen
Like forty floors up I grew a pair of wings
In that moment man I knew I could do anything
Feeling like a young Simba can't wait to be a king
And I never lost my hunger man I stayed hungry
If we started talking numbers man they wouldn't love me
Man I'd rather keep the peace but its getting ugly
But fuck it what I'm about to say is what they didn't want me
60k first week for the Bada$$
200k to this day I know you niggas mad
With the 80/20 split my nigga do the math
My nigga Kirk just outsold Troy Ave
Now they sleep we 'bout to hit 'em with the NYCK next
Got these niggas bread hurt, Limp Bizkit
Its crunch time had to go and get his shit wreck
Got the ninjas on deck and bitches in check
And that's a shot to anybody man I don't feel you
Steezy told me to go hard and niggas ain't hear you
I see the whole future clearer and I'm near it too
And if you really break a leg, I hope they still will cheer you

[Hook 3]
Man its gon' be a real long time I'mma be around
So make way through the crowd
Swimming through a sea of people hope I don't drown
Just trying to make waves with the sound
When my shit drop bitch turn it up loud
And tune them other niggas out
I'm the youngest nigga repping heavy for my city now
Tell these other niggas I'm coming for the crown

[Outro]
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide
Tell me is you ready is you really ready
Nah they ain't really ready they ain't never ready
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide
Ready or not here I come, you can't hide
Tell me is you ready is you really ready
Nah they ain't really ready they ain't never ready, bitch
