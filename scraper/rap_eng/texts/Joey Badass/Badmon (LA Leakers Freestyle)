[Intro:]
Yo Badmon things
But yo, we out in L.A. though man
Shout to the leakers man
Yo, check it out

[Verse:]
The man rose, little concrete rose
Put your hands together folks, for the black roach
Bout to deliver, like stagecoach
Now I stay posting my nigga, now what's the signs
My fountain of youth is all drying
One minute we all smiling and then poof, we fall sad and then
I be digging deep for this thing, I ain't finding this
Either I'm insane or my brain and to be honest that's probably what it is
You've seen that you probably can't live with
You probably can't stomach, you probably can't ingest
At times you so hungry, got mad dreams wishing that it all get sunny
But for now it's money this, money that
[?], that's just sure when I lie
Even cause your homicide on the streets to NY
A little shortie asked me, what's my purpose and why
I told her "Save the Children", [?]
You said for sure that's thight, but what's the dollar signs in that
The hella fine dimes with that, ass so fat
The phantom in the Maybach, that black Mac that go (pew-pew)
That's when I said, yo chill shortie relax
Let me open your mind
Division is color-blind, it's fine the light can still shine
I consume this time, he begin to unravel
And travel to a place he thought that he would never find

[Outro:]
Badmon, yeah
Check it out, one time, yeah
I want my LA shit nigga
Yeah, I'm with the Leakers yeah
And I'm smoking reefer, big cheefer
Alright shouts to all my people out in LA though
