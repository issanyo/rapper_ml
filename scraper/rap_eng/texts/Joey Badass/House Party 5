[Bridge x2]
Catch a vibe, Catch a vibe
Me and Powers, the new Kid 'N Play
House party five, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook x2]
Woke up in the mornin', time to get it started
Who this on my line, is that yo' chick she callin'
Told her pull up at the crib, that's if she feelin' naughty
Got the henny in me shawty said let's have a party

[Verse]
Wasted, we fuckin' wasted
Rollin' up, that's living day shit
We gettin' faded
Livin' my life for the thrill
All I do is chase it
And I'm known to keep it real
I can never fake it
Welcome to my house of pain
How much shots you takin'
Takin' henny to the brain
And we never fake it
Livin' my life in the moment
I can never waste it
Got these bitches gettin' naked
My goodness gracious
Got the house upon the hills with the sweetest view
Strippin' last straw on the grill right by the heated pool
Ain't no netflixin' and chillin' when we rendezvous
I just fuck it up a minute, pass it to the crew
Powers said that's what they do

[Hook 2]
Woke up in the mornin', time to get it started
Who this on my line, is that yo' bitch she callin'
Tell her pull up at the crib, that's if she feelin' naughty
Got the henny in me shawty said let's have a party
Invite a couple friends and we gon' act retarded
Posin' with the gang you see it's at the squaddy
Please don't tell them thotties, they be on my body
Got the henny in me shawty said - let's go

Me and Cardo, the new Kid 'N Play
House party five, yeah, yeah, yeah
