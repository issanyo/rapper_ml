[Verse 1: Dizzy Wright]
Yo, call me a hard workin' nigga
I shouldn't use nigga cause that's what was used against us
But still I abuse it and use it, look how they did us
A lot of shit's changed, but something's installed in us
We can't figure out, the Willie Lynch gave them the in and outs
Will 'em look who's doin' all the fuckin' killin' now
We got that after slavery, nothin' you can say to me
Attitude with Malcolm X speakin' and teachin' bravery
Violence is only needed when you feel defeated
And parents, pay attention, it ain't cool to raise a demon
That's on lockdown, got out, and now he actin' hostile
You threw away your opportunities, nigga that's a cop-out
Not now, we can argue later, all in favor
Raise your hands if you deserve another chance
Fan of a fan, we sharin' the same things
We see the bumps in the road, we smoke and we maintain

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
So I, play my position with persistence
Consistent with the flow, nigga we twistin' up the dro
In this life of sin, through the highs and lows
Trials and tribulations, you know how it go
I pray you niggas maintain
I pray you niggas maintain
Cause when shit gets all bad and you watch the game change
Fuck the bullshit, it's time to maintain
You gotta maintain

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Two hours early, rise and shine
No ride, catchin' the bus to be on time
No time for excuses, it's your life, you can't be stuck on stupid
I give 'em the awkward nod like I can't be without a job
Helpin' moms with the bombs, I mean the bills
I mean, bombs is how they feel but how I feel don't stop the build
See when you go without a meal, you stop taking your plate for granted
We was strong when we was weak, that's why I pray before I eat
It's bittersweet when it's something you wanna keep
And if that nigga don't wanna help, fuck it, do it by yourself
But put in effort to better your situation
If not for y'all, then do it for the baby, the system crazy
Whether you got you a son or you a daughter
Don't run away from your problems or your partner, maintain
I know it's getting hard, but it gets harder
You gotta understand, that's the shit that makes you a man

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
So I, play my position with persistence
Consistent with the flow, nigga we twistin' up the dro
In this life of sin, through the highs and lows
Trials and tribulations, you know how it go
I pray you niggas maintain
I pray you niggas maintain
Cause when shit gets all bad and you watch the game change
Fuck the bullshit, it's time to maintain
You gotta maintain

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
Gladly, threw the snappy on my nappy
And the razor where it aches in case a nigga try to clap me
I ain't a killa but for skrilla it gets nasty
Pop up on the wrong night, get popped like mad acne
It ain't no comin' home for you homie
It's funny, fuckin' with these rhymes over time'll turn you phony
See niggas makin' money becomin' dealers
Deal a pound to squealers, then give the beats out until he Dilla
It gets more realer, for real, niggas'll take your
Life, and won't even get life for the steal
And if you grill, your grill gets Foreman'd, blow out your funds
Then leave it as a warnin' for informants out front like a doorman
Ain't kiddin', can't take the heat, get out the kitchen
It's things for soft guys like you, like knittin' mittens
Kissin' kittens, stitchin' snitches, whisperin'
Disses, steady wish you had my bitches and my riches
Punk niggas

[Hook: Dizzy Wright]
So I, play my position with persistence
Consistent with the flow, nigga we twistin' up the dro
In this life of sin, through the highs and lows
Trials and tribulations, you know how it go
I pray you niggas maintain
I pray you niggas maintain
Cause when shit gets all bad and you watch the game change
Fuck the bullshit, it's time to maintain
You gotta maintain

[Outro: Joey BADA$$ & (Dizzy Wright)]
Pass the herb, pass the herb
(Pass the herb)
Pass the herb, pass the herb
(Pass the herb)
Pass the herb, pass the word
(I got the word for the game, niggas better maintain)
Pass the herb, pass the herb
(Pass the herb)
Pass the herb, pass the herb
(Pass the herb)
Pass the herb, pass the word
(I got the word for the game, niggas better maintain)
