[Intro]
Lately I've been on that fuck a nigga bitch (Fuck Lil' bitch)
Pass it to the clique, you ain't gonna do shit
Twenty-five thousand for that Rollie on my wrist (Rolly on my)
All these labels wanna sign, I told them I'm already rich (I'm already rich)

[Chorus]
Yeah, hold up, (Ay) hold up, hey (Ay)
Lately been on that fuck a nigga bitch (Fuck Lil' bitch)
Pass it to the clique, you ain't gonna do shit
Twenty-five thousand for that Rolly on my wrist (Rolly on my)
All these labels wanna sign, I told them I'm already rich (I'm already rich)
Eastside nigga, I'ma get it off the rip
I be movin' 'round with the Eight Tray Crips
They be running down if a nigga talk shit
Guarantee you if I shoot my shot I won't miss

[Verse]
Put that on my mother, I'm a jiggy motherfucker
Pulling up with a redbone, like my name was Donald Glover
Hit 'em up, I feel like 2Pac, bitch I'm sicker than a flu shot
Pussy nigga why you always tryna fuck like something that you not
If we really got problems send the addy we can solve 'em there
We got automatics, ain't no time for the arguing
You don't want no static man, the shit'll be really shockin' me
Hollow tips turning all you niggas into holograms
Don't bother me, I ain't gotta put it on display (hey)
Conscious nigga but I still be givin' out them fades (hey)
You think because I be preaching, I ain't trying to get paid
Fuck that, these niggas be ridin' in the lanes that I paved (facts)
Should not have gassed them, now I gotta tax 'em
Push a nigga whip back like filet, I'ma snatch 'em
I stay with a bitch who looks like she came out of Maxim
Ion' never cuff 'em tho swear, all I do is smash

[Chorus]
Hold up, Yea, Hey hey, hold up, Ay
Lately I've been on that fuck a nigga bitch (Fuck Lil' bitch)
Pass it to the clique, you ain't gonna do shit
Twenty-five thousand for that Rollie on my wrist (Rolly on my)
So these labels wanna sign, I told them I'm already rich (I'm already rich)
Eastside nigga, I'ma get it off the rip
I be movin' 'round with the Eight Tre Crips
They be running down if a nigga talk shit (hey)
Guarantee you if I shoot my shot I won't miss

[Outro]
Blaow
Du, du du du du du duu
Hey, hey ay ay, Ayy
