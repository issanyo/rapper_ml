And this feels like a victory
The competition looks slim to me
Yeah, 'cause this story is history
Homie this my story, no mystery
Yeah, 'cause this feels like a victory
The competition looks slim to me
Yeah, 'cause this story is history
Homie this my story

[Verse 1]
First things first, uh, shoutout to the sponsors
Everything I do I do it big, I'm a monster
The kid from West Brooklyn, came with the thunder
Every day another triple-double entendre
At times I sit and wonder how I keep from going under
But I always beat the clock like Kyrie Irving at the buzzer
Looking in the crowd, at the audience they love us
Got a team of warriors nobody ranked above us
And I got love for my brothers keep the chemistry strong
We gon' be up for a while like keep the legacy goin'
The most valuable Pro heading straight for the throne
I'm in a lane of my own, two-three when I get in my zone
Even when I'm OT man I still feel at home
The G-O-A-T when it's all said and done
They only make legends where I'm from
Been known we won before the song begun

[Hook]
And this feels like a victory
The competition looks slim to me
Yeah, 'cause this story is history
Homie this my story, no mystery
'cause this feels like a victory
The competition looks slim to me
Yeah, 'cause this story is history
Homie this my story

[Verse 2]
I know that you wishing he prolly break a leg
And even if they still wheelchair him in the end
'Til his last stand, swear I got love for my fans
Back by popular demand, I'm the man
All I do is win I feels like a highlight reel
I put numbers on the board even scores up the floor for real
I do it just for sport
Like the homies with the rock in the white tube socks
Word is bond, I am the one
I got it locked, up in the cluster, pressure on
Back on the block, I call the shots
You sit and watch when I'm against the clock I make the world stop
Hold up, but let's get back to business please
I'ma be up for a while I know you sick of me
Y'all ain't real ballers, y'all just little leagues
And we ain't taking no losses we the winning team, East

[Hook]
And this feels like a victory
The competition looks slim to me
Yeah, 'cause this story is history
Homie this my story, no mystery
Yeah, 'cause this feels like a victory
The competition look slim to me
Yeah, 'cause this story is history
