[Verse 1: Tablo]
Where I'm from
"Han" is the name we gave to struggle and pain
This river runs through our city like it runs through our veins
To us it's the one thing above all things; money, love, gods and kings
It's what's driving us be it ahead or insane
We said Shotgun to it, wishing that it takes us, navigates us to a better living
It's with us, cramped up in a bus, subways, our schools and our building
It's the price that's our "아빠"'s paid to buy food for the children
It sits at the bottom of the pot when our "엄마"'s got that hot "된장국" in the kitchen
On and on, it makes us hustle on
For the money, we fight, fall but overcome, that's why we call it "Won"
"Han" is spoken yet unspoken, we could be broke but never broken
It made my father work the graveyard shift and still makes his graveyard shift
And that's that shit right there, what you call "Soul" is a city right here
From "홍대" to Bedstuy, we're born from the same pain shed alike tears, yeah

[Hook: Tablo]
Some call it pain, we call it "사랑", man
Middle finger to the hate and the broken minds that can't relate, yeah
And that's that shit right there
누가 뭐래도 내 심장에
자리잡은 도시, 날 깨우는 아침의 소리
밤의 빛 right here (right here, right here, right here)
Some call it pain, we call it "사랑", man
Middle finger to the hate and the broken minds that can't related, yeah

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Been rap supreme
It is only right how I tax a fiend
Been handing out styles, no that ain't free
The most adapt to green, without the greed
I deserve honors, lots of furs and designers
Tucked under wet vaginas, in Havana eating benihana
While I puff ganja Then forget all my drama
Like I ain’t got no fucking problems man this money keep piling in
B.I.G said it
Mo' money mo' headaches
Know he looking down like, “Oh, so now you get it?”
Yes I do, it’s best you too
I take the money from you then invest in my crew
These chest moves, you couldn't guess what's next too
I heard the night creepin' up with the next moon
Somewhere round next June, Somewhere I flex too
At the fact that these raps more like vegetables to you
But im livin sweet, i got the juice sip slow like it's lemon tea
With gin too
Hot toddy, served to me with a nice mami Look like Dej Loaf
Catch a body if ya try me
She so sexy, got a deadly appearance
She dressed up and killed herself in the mirror
Good lord help me
The massacre got clearer, bet she still believe in ya selfie

[Hook: Joey Bada$$]
And that's that shit right there
Another j blown in the mist right there
A sunny day won't make this pic clear
For all the dead and gone, put a spliff in the air, yeah
This one for pain, this one for the hate
Middle finger to you lames
You broke ass niggas you can't relate, yeah
And that's that shit right there
Another j blown in the mist right there
A sunny day won't make this pic clear
For all the dead and gone, put a spliff in the air, yeah
This one for pain, this one for the hate
Middle finger to you lames
You broke ass niggas you can't relate, yeah

[Bridge: Joey Bada$$ + Tablo]
Good lord help me
힙겹지만 곧 행복이 되겠지
Good lord help me
두렵지만 곧 행복이 되겠지

[Hook 2: Joey Bada$$ & Tablo]
And that's that shit right there
A little J blowing in the mist right there
A sunny day won't make this pic clear
For all the dead and gone, put a spliff in the air, yeah
This one for pain, this one for the hate
Middle finger to you lames
You broke ass niggas you can't relate
And that's that shit right there
What you call ‘Soul' is our city right here
From "홍대" to Bedstuy, we're
Born from the same pain, shed alike tears, yeah
Some call it pain, we call it "사랑" man
Middle finger to the hate and the broken minds that can't relate, yeah
