[Intro]
Yeah, haha, yeah, gun shots in your area, gun shots in your...

[Hook]
Me and my niggas really tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas we just tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas really tryna stay paid
Just tryna get rich in the next seven days, but
Me and my niggas really tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas we just tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas we just tryna stay paid
Just tryna get ends for the rest of our days

[Verse 1]
Ain't tryna be a slave, I can't be bought
Ever since I caught the wave, I can see shore
And I ain't tryna see floor, I'm 'bout to blow like a C4
Niggas changed like the seasons and I can see salt
I keep one eye open, I can always see all
This one for my niggas hustling tryna seek more
For my brothers in the pen, tryna see again
Squeezing triggers on my niggas with the clippers like C. Paul
That was sorrow to the children of tomorrow
Another pill swallowed and a bottle of Moscato
Shots follow like a train, this shit never end
Same city, different boroughs, so we can't be friends
I can't pretend this shit don't bother me
Money for lottery but can't solve poverty
The streets is starving me, of all my good wills and my sovereignty
I hope my people don't dishonor me, but I'm just tryna get paid

[Hook]
Me and my niggas really tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas we just tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas really tryna stay paid
Just tryna get rich in the next seven days, but
Me and my niggas really tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas we just tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas we just tryna stay paid
Just tryna get ends for the rest of our days

[Bridge]
We just tryna stay paid
My niggas tryna stay paid
Wonder if heaven got a ghetto
But I ain't tryna be no slave
Cause we just tryna stay paid
My niggas tryna stay paid
Wondering if heaven got a ghetto
Cause I ain't really tryna be a slave

[Verse 2]
Now you could be the prophet or you could be the scholar but what's power?
Is knowing that your knowledge make you richer than the dollar
Who couldn't afford college, but nigga paid attention
Dropped out and now he getting paid for attending
But that ain't my message, just the road that I stepped in
My curse and my blessings, watch as life teach lessons
People wanna bet that I walked it off, folks, uh
Here's a silver spoon full of salt, it's your call
Just please don't leave me spoilt for too long, you know time
That old man's blind, couldn't see him, doing the crime
Oh, sweet, mother of mine, ya child will come to grow
Weathers on that wise dome so I always come to know
Just don't get too comfortable, seek knowledge and get the dough
Cash will come when you see your people open up your soul to them
Cause they the only one that know the way you feel
I move [?] 'til I'm in my holy feel
And if you knew me, then you probably know me still
And I ain't make it yet but know I strictly will
This ain't no time to chill, it's time to collect
Time to step it, you respect, yo, with that mic check, uh

[Hook]
Me and my niggas really tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas we just tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas really tryna stay paid
Just tryna get rich in the next seven days, but
Me and my niggas really tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas we just tryna stay paid
Me and my niggas we just tryna stay paid
Just tryna get ends for the rest of our days

[Bridge]
We just tryna stay paid
My niggas tryna stay paid
Wonder if heaven got a ghetto
But I ain't tryna be no slave
Cause we just tryna stay paid
My niggas tryna stay paid
Wondering if heaven got a ghetto
Cause I ain't really tryna be a slave
