[Hook: Annalise Azadian]
You were here
And now you're gone, disappeared
In the break of dawn it feels surreal
Oh how did it go so wrong
Oh how did it go so wrong

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
And everyday I think about you
Shirley Temples in your name, I gotta drink about two now
Livin' seems strange, functionin' without you, how
Do I cope with pain and feelin' doubtful
I swear still to this day man it cuts me so deep
Every time I see a grave I get down on one knee
Then I call the Lord's name and ask him is it just me
Or do I not deserve to just be at peace
Tryna keep my mind at ease, searchin' for relief
You was always there for me when nobody believed
Still in minor disbelief thinkin' bout you and STEEZ
Everyday till the clock stops, it's time left for me
But until then workin' hard is my bliss
It's the only way I know to take my mind off of this
I ain't got too much choices but to focus instead
And I can still hear your voices at the back of my head, yeah

[Hook: Annalise Azadian]
You were here
And now you're gone, disappeared
In the break of dawn it feels surreal
Oh how did it go so wrong
Oh how did it go so wrong

[Verse 2: Jim Jones]
We supposed to hit the tunnel for your birthday
But three shots then it turned to the worst day
Me and Dough was up the block with the pistol with us
For some niggas up the block that had an issue with us
But that's here nor there
It hurt to see your family have to cry tear for tear
Still eye for eye
I be paranoid I keep the steel by my side
Not too much has changed
Still be pourin' liquor, drinkin' pain for the pain
Wishin' you was here
Wishin' you was with me buyin' whips every year
Shit to get you back, I be callin' God up
Did you get to see Stacks, did he tell you squad up?
Did you see Pac? Is he thuggin' with Fatal?
Did you see Pac? Is he thuggin' with Cado?
There's a whole bunch of others
Of mothers that cried and brothers that died up in the gutter

[Hook: Annalise Azadian]
You were here
And now you're gone, disappeared
In the break of dawn it feels surreal
Oh how did it go so wrong
Oh how did it go so wrong
