[Intro: Maverick Sabre & Joey Bada$$]
We don't wanna be
We don't wanna be
You better duck
Press your luck
Time's up!
Motha-
Alright let's get it
One time let's split it

[Verse]
Too bluesy, black choosy
A drive-by means slow cruisin'
No 2s-in', it's been no shootin'
No roof and I (?)
I just got to breathe, is someone watchin' me?!
Yeah, they gon' let me be, so they stop and they search for my ID

[Pre-Hook]
And did you even know we could change this?
Brothers really found me a racist
How'd you tell they're meant to behave
When you're pushing them around on the pavement?
And did you even know we could change this?
Brothers really found me a racist
How'd you tell they're meant to behave
When you're pushing them around on the pavement?

[Interlude]
And even though these days they seem to haunt you
There's many more to change
And you try, and you try, and you try

[Hook: Maverick Sabre & Joey Bada$$]
We don't wanna be
So we're not gonna be!
Retain my madness
We don't wanna be insane
So we're not gonna be
Trapped by disaster
We don't wanna be contained
So we're not gonna be
Retained by madness
We don't wanna be insane
So we're not gonna be
Trapped by disaster
We don't wanna be!

[Verse 2]
I wonder why, buddy, what ya think of me?
Askin' me my name and arise to me
I got a bag on me and not a thing in it
But they understand, they can handle
I got the (?)
Where I can be in hell free
Runnin' alley alley in the parley for pretendance
See see he pretendin' neva crowded
I ain't honest

[Pre-Hook]
First the TV was a problem
Now IP PC, I deem to solve it
Turn down the volume
No love, no hug, just thugs in armor
First the TV was a problem
Now IP PC, I deem to solve it
Turn down the volume
No love, no hug, just thugs in armor

[Bridge]
And even though these days they seem to haunt you
There's many more to change
And you try, and you try, and you try

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
One time, they shootin', I make the books
I'm a slave to the page that the Times took
Babylon, how my mind shook
Made one false move, got caught reaching for the wrong book
And that's just the way it's set up
They left us, soon or late it ain't the best luck
It's messed up, we against the odds (?)
In Babylon, talk back to my ancestor
Triple Great Gran, I can feel yo pain
Judged by your jewelry, walk with my chain
Judge Judy, not one man should have that power
Even regular widow's official powder
Ain't no country for wise men
Every day I look up at this horror rising
Now the homies arriving, if it's all surprising
Maybe if we'd unified we could survive

[Hook: Maverick Sabre & Joey Bada$$]
We don't wanna be
So we're not gonna be!
Retain my madness
We don't wanna be insane
So we're not gonna be
Trapped by disaster
We don't wanna be contained
So we're not gonna be
Retained by madness
We don't wanna be insane
So we're not gonna be
Trapped by disaster
We don't wanna be!

[Outro: Maverick Sabre & Joey Bada$$]
Retain my madness, resort my sadness (insane)
Trapped by disaster, maintain the balance (contain)
Retain my madness, resort my sadness (insane)
Trapped by disaster, maintain the balance (contain)
Retain my madness, resort my sadness (insane)
Trapped by disaster, maintain the balance (contain)
Retain my madness, resort my sadness (insane)
Trapped by disaster, maintain the balance (contain)
We don't wanna be
We not gonna be
We don't wanna be
We not gonna be
We don't wanna be
We not gonna be
We don't wanna be
We not gonna be
We don't wanna be
We not gonna be
We don't wanna be
We not gonna be
We don't wanna be
We not gonna be
We don't wanna be
We not gonna be
