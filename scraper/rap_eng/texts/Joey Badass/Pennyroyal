[Verse]
Yeah... another love song gone wrong
Should've known you were a woo, like Based God in Wonton
But I didn't, and I ain't even tripping
Another foul ball but I'm still glad I hit it
Cause a lot of niggas didn't, you know, the coulda shoulda type
Like "Oh, it was slight too tight, come on, I would've piped
But our schedules contradicted we're always tied down"
Ay pipe down, the first night ya boy laid the pipe down
Took off the night gown and, pulled out the slinky
She screamed "Joey spank me!", and after that she even thanked me
Swanky, one time for my nigga Dymes
Lord knows we be kicking rhymes 'til the end of time
But, back to the topic, oh yeah I'm pissed off
I'm still tripped off and wondering why my shorty dipped off
I ain't gonna front a nigga do miss her lip gloss
Now she sucks the next nigga dick off and my dick soft
So tell me what the fuck I'm 'posed to do?
And you know it ain't too easy getting over you
I sent them postcards so you know it's true
I promised that I wouldn't get emotional
And I'm not, so stop it
Why you front like you don't miss my whole cockpit down yo esophagus?
Screaming "Daddy, stop it", ripping out your tracks
Chipped nail polishing in the scratches on my back like
Did you forget about the time we had the sticky rolled?
And I tried to suck your titty hole for milk for my Cheerios
Did you forget about the video when you first came?
I hit that spot twice and since then, you haven't been the same
But now I heard you fucking with some new man
Can't remember his name but my first impression, "What a lame"
Lorraine said she seen him at a bowling lane
Walking out the bathroom kinda strange with his shoulder stained
Faggot, six months, and I'm still at it
You'll probably never hear this track but I still wrapped it
I guess I'm still attracted to you being here
I swear I can't imagine you would not even care
Whole thing played out like magic and itâ€™s kinda weird
It's like I did a trick and you won't reappear
It ain't fair, I need you back, sometimes I get scared
But I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears

[Bridge]
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player, ain't gonna let you see my tears
Cause I'm a player

[Hook]
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eye
So I gotta to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eyes
So I had to make the song cry
I couldn't see it coming down my eye
So I gotta to make the song cry, yeah
