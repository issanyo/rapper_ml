[Intro: Action Bronson]
(I don't give a fuck y'all)
It’s like motherfuckin’ voodoo in here (Yeah)
Uh, uh

[Verse 1: Action Bronson]
I've been down but never been out
Around the world since I been out
Now I'm about to fuck around, pull the pin out
Cause kids needs clothes on they back
And daddy needs new gold spokes on the lack out
Still posing for flicks holding my dick head
At the table ripping bread with my day ones
Ain't shit changed, dawg, I got the same number
Just a little bit of money and some fame, huh
The hunger stronger than ever
I can taste blood on my taste buds
Holler back at me in eight months
Glowed up like a rave in the forest
In all white eating orange

[Hook: Action Bronson]
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life

[Verse 2: Action Bronson]
The high top Air Force One all canvas
Took those off, hit the stage wearing sandals
Four X white t-shirt, that's standard
And 1 shorts, '96 on the camera
Baby got me stiffer than L.A. Looks
So I hit her with that New York dick
Number 3, John Starks on the jersey
Bitch I've been doing this for thirty
The hair on my face says I'm a dominant man with no regards
Catch ya boy on Queens Boulevard
Sunk in the seat of something classic
Sittin' on the floor like a gypsy in a basket
Damn I'm a bastard

[Hook: Action Bronson & Joey Bada$$]
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
Check it out, yo
It's a beautiful life

[Verse 3: Joey Bada$$]
The lemon grass in the bally shack
Hit up Chuck, what up, I'm on my Cali swag
Cadillac dreams, transactions in between
The man and his cream, every thought brought the penny back
Ballin' off that, yo, thanks for the alley act
Probably paint the cut, all black like an alley cat
Middle fingers up
You fuck boys, fucked up
Ya dismissed, had one shot but time's up
Make the block boys go crazy
Take a whiff
Ain't worried about another life
We tryin' to change, shift my reality
Life from my ankle ain't actually all you perceive, these eyes can deceive
Holdin' back but I'm never holdin' out
So I doubt what ya lil' trap mouth chat 'bout
Know they strapped like the back of the couch
We the era, black out on any rat in the house
Smash ya spouse until the cat tap out
Asses out until she passes out
No doubt we gettin' cash now
Use to be class clown
Don't worry about beef
I'm feelin' like a cash cow

[Hook: Action Bronson & Joey Bada$$]
And it's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
It's a beautiful life
