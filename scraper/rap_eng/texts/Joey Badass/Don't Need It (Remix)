[Hook: Merna]
Fuck what them say, I, I don't need it
Them wanna build you today just to tear you down
And don't let them preach, and I don't believe it
See there's no weight to they words, they can't wear me down
No, I don't need it
No, I don't need it, oh
No, I don't need it
No, I don't need it, oh
No, I don't need it

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
I woke up satisfied
I'll never let your negativity kill my vibe
I know everybody's dreams don't survive
That's the difference between me and them in this life
Everybody talk a lot
I remember not to follow what they talk about
Was told it starts with me
I know I'm the illest out, sheep gon' be sheep
So I know you'll come around in time
They always do, they don't ever let you down
Talkin' about everything you need except the crown
Your gift and your passion, to them don't ever count
'Til your name in lights and money overflowing in accounts
All you bitches look like clowns

[Hook: Merna]
Fuck what them say, I, I don't need it
Them wanna build you today just to tear you down
And don't let them preach, and I don't believe it
See there's no weight to they words, they can't wear me down
No, I don't need it
No, I don't need it, oh
No, I don't need it
No, I don't need it, oh
No, I don't need it

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Coulda did it, all on my lonely, didn't need no homies
Just me only and this mic recording
The beat get the beats when the beast in hungry
Thought I'd be livin' in the streets like my teachers told me
As if she should know me, Miss Sissy wanna be so nosey
It's a feelin' in the air, I know you smell it
Teen spirit, Nirvana we gettin' hit with the drama
We can't hear it so don't preach it to me
They don't wanna see you ball they wanna see you fallin'
When they get too far they treat you like Kobe
As if he ain't scorin' but it's like he got a hex that's stuck up on him
So everybody in this dance won't applaud him, don't respect his glory
They fill us up with doubts like "he can't beat Jordan"
That's when he turned around and gave his best performance
He coulda used his mouth but put his best feet forward

[Bridge: Merna]
It's here in your own star
Once you wake up and realize who you are
'Til we know
We don't need it
No,  I don't need it, oh
I don't need it

[Verse 3: Rapsody]
Yo let me apologise for the other types
That make you feel like you could ever steal my light
Joy always come in the morning, no matter what the night do
Might not be today, but one day they gon' understand you
I stay blackin' out on these records
No question by now you all should know my complexion
Many seats you can have me to usher, I got confessions
Most of them shits ain't pleasure to you
Why y'all seem so hesitant to fuck with me?
Is it pride due to my estrogen? Yea luckily
Air your shit out like smokin' shrubbery, that's a Black Friday
That's a line crazier than Black Friday
Got it mixed up, better call Ali, I'mma catch some bodies
(Fuck what them say) I'mma catch some bodies
One too many snakes in the garden
I question who they guardin' like field threw a guard in
In the Garden, J Madison, brief was the president
Offered them no pardons, so it's nada
So we pray for our brothers and our sisters and our fathers
Lookin' at me crazy like Drake did Madonna
Uh, kiss of death, they can't fuck with me mama

[Hook: Merna]
I don't need it
No,  I don't need it, oh
I don't need it, oh
No,  I don't need it, oh
I don't need it, oh
No,  I don't need it, oh
I don't need it
