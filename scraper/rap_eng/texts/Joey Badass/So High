[Intro: Chuck Strangers]
This nigga done smoke half my eighth
Bout to get high nigga
Bout to get high nigga
Bout to get high nigga
So high
So high
So high
So high
I'm so high

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Got the bomb nigga, Baghdad, I'm blown away from a bad pass
Walk on grass, below skunk, I smell sole funk in the stash
My SB's, antimony I never had
I was more arsenic, vaporize when I got heated
Never jealous, solid as a rock n' roll fo' planes
No propellers, just some Pro fellas
Who you know better? Never lost my groove, I don't know no Stella
It's a cold world without Coachella
A shady bunch, like under Interscope umbrella
But that don't phase me once, people say I'm crazy blunt
Call me young Evel cause I crazy stunt
Amaze these punks, drop swank like it's knowledge to ya
Mr. Bada$$ is the scholar's tutors
Swank the lord and hallelujah
Still praying to the Allahs, Gods and Judas

[Hook]
Balance out my lows and I'm (so high)
Chillin' with the pros and I'm (so high)
Nigga ain't know I'm just (so high)
Kicking out my flow and I'm (so high)
Balance out my lows and I'm (so high)
Chillin' with the pros and I'm (so high)
Nigga ain't know I'm just (so high)
Kicking out my flow and I'm (so high)

[Verse 2: Chuck Strangers]
The sun came up, don't wanna get out of bed
Turn the TV on the price is right but your life is wrong
Two hits from the bong and my problems go gone
My rhyme game strong, bitch on my arm
Tryna be my girl, we mix the weed with the Marlboro
We way to fly to hit mall bro bro
Your favorite brand gave me some pieces
But they clothes is ass, told em to fuckin' keep it
Started out on rookie, now we on some elite shit
Scribble raps on your iPhone, I make you delete shit
Peep this, I was on a humble, you on every station
I was dropping samples being patient

[Hook]
Balance out my lows and I'm (so high)
Chillin' with the pros and I'm (so high)
Nigga ain't know I'm just (so high)
Kicking out my flow and I'm (so high)
Balance out my lows and I'm (so high)
Chillin' with the pros and I'm (so high)
Nigga ain't know I'm just (so high)
Kicking out my flow and I'm (so high)
