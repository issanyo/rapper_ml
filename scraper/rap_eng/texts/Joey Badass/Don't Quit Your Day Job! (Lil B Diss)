[Intro]
That nigga sent warning shots, nigga
I'm actually offended that this nigga ain't come harder than this
Cause I’m about to straight ether this nigga
Straight ether this nigga, tiny shirt ass nigga
If I ever catch you slipping on Joseph
I seen you on Lombard Street, nigga you don’t want it
We out here, nigga, get your facts straight

[Verse]
I got an issue with this little bitch shih tzu
I'm a pitbull, throw lyrical missiles that won't miss you
Rip open your tissue make your task force miss you
It made no sense to diss you, so I dish you
Nothing but food you little bitch
I drop nines like cat fish sticks and shrimp like you and steak too
No bitch, ever gonna get pimp like you
Hit you with the cane 'til you sick in the brain
Ya think drilling your brain, you Pink Flame ass nigga
Lame ass nigga
Publicity stunts for the fame ass nigga
Bada$$ not lying but you gotta tame that nigga
Holla at, not replying, now you dying
Joey Bad blame that nigga, restrain that nigga
You Purple Rain ass nigga
How you trying to be Prince in a Queen B mix?
Little faggot pants dance you make no sense
Don't quit your day job
Cause after this, your campaign wrecked
I could do this all day y'all
It ain't no sweat, ain't no threat
Is this little bitch sick? Cause there ain't no vets for the love
And ain't nothing less I come next, ain't a nun
I'm the one, I think I spit lozenge
The Bada$$ enforcing
This niggas off I put him in a (cough, cough) coffin
Make yourself a pitch and get tossed in
I could do this often on your porch in
Foreign, this a warrant, we warning, if you want we still be
Sparring with the martians with an army of spartans
Sparking up I fuck yo bitch when I park your truck
Rockin' a 49ers' park - what?

[Outro]
