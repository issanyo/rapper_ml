You remind me of my Jeep
I wanna wax it
In traffic, in traffic

[Verse 1: Joey Bada$$]
Switchin lanes, I'm swervin
Getting brain I'm learning
Nigga getting burn, how he gettin his earning
Turn me to ashes, I put it on they asses
Back from the dead with the dead button
Dash is the fastest, swervin' thru traffic
Don't worry I'll catch him I'm barely distracted
Attractive bad bitch tryna get wax like my hash is
And if you crashin know pussy cats get caskets
Don't get gassed, and if you clutch just know these blunts won't get passed
I put your guts in a open bag, why you toten that?
Where ya tokens at? This just ain't potent packs shit is choking gas
Sim simmer who got the keys in the bimmer?
Who see police in the mirror? Who do Mach 3 speeds on the highway?
Beast coast where I lay won't stop till my day

[Verse 2: Issa Gold]
Racing in my drop top, one god one pop
Shawty going on about her main how his team flop
She mesmerized as I hit her mind
How I hit her spot back at my spot right on my mothers couch ouch
We on that Brooklyn shit, speeding soulfully thru the game
Living up fuck your fame I'm above uh
Growin' up they say you never really change
But since my younger days I been switchin' lanes paving the way
School we never showing up, home with homies rollin' up
Sittin' in the back of the bus pourin' a 40 up
Niggas never quacking at us, homies'll fold em up
World about to end so whaddup, lets roll the whole thing up
Yeah the whole OG, keep it in motion
Beast Coast yeah we chosen, nigga sick got the potion
I'm hoping the knowledge me and my niggas spoken
Will find  a nigga in the villa smoking on something potent
You niggas is fucking hopeless, and me and my niggas focused

[Verse 3: Meechy Darko]
Lawd ah Mercy!... uhh
I'm sitting in the whip dreaming about tactics
On this rap shit and how to make my cash flip
You need practice, I already get my ass kissed
Flows nasty I could probably sell a blank disk
Kate Moss tee on 28 grams bitch I get my OZ on
Laney 14's bitch I get my OG on
Got on Christian Dior but we living like we demons
Talking shit and rolling up thats the wave that we on
MCM jacket, gold teeth like I'm Jerome
Teeth shroomed up, acid drops in my cup
Don't just sit there girl what's up
Pop that pussy crack a dutch, and roll it up take one puff
Rubber cover me up, you know some women are crazy
Lil nigga ain't mine—that Trojan got yo' baby
She said, "Meech—don't even try to play me."
I switched gears; Jeep went "Ehr!" like Jamie
