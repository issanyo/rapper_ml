[Chorus: Curren$y]
Roll up every mornin', before we get down to this 'ish
Plottin' how to murder these motherfuckers 'fore they kill us
Street's on fire, I'm still one of the coldest niggas
Dollar sign eyes, youngin' you gotta have them visions
Dollar sign eyes (dollar sign eyes, dollar sign eyes)
Dollar sign eyes, gotta have them visions

[Verse 1: Curren$y]
American dream, foreign machines
13 Lamborghinis arrived on the scene
R.I.P. to the club 'cause we killed it
She chose up and left ya, she left with us, she don't feel ya
I'm in the truck, rollin' up, I'm with my familia
We familiar with them millions, 'cause we been livin'
Ownership, and you only visit, you can't take it with ya
This was reserved for real niggas and bitches addicted to figures
Shit cold, it could kill ya, you need an intervention
The taste of money in yo system, and you stuck with it
Like a tapeworm pushin' you to earn digits
Save the deposit, this yacht came with a helicopter
Hop out the Wraith, yo bitch wan' take some pictures by it
Hate in your eyes as you watchin'

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Roll up every mornin' and then we get down to the 'ish
Plottin' how to murder these motherfuckers 'fore they kill us
Street's on fire, I'm still one of the coldest niggas
Dollar sign eyes, youngin' you gotta have them visions
Dollar sign eyes

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
My nigga I'm just happy to be here, happy to see fear
Right in his eyes, and there's nothin' to be scared
About anymore, nothing but me and my Lord
On this journey on my course, see the effects of what I've caused
Now I, just throw it in the bag, never matter what that shit cost
'Cause I can't afford to not floss
50 thousand on the wardrobe, but that's a write off
On the income tax, otherwise a nice loss, ha ha
I got this shit mastered, I'm in a different bracket
She hit me after droppin' five bands on the jacket
Shit the old me would have had to jack it
But now the chips stackin', and I'm livin' lavish
It's steady mackin', if your bitch attractin' (attractin')
'Cause I'm a chick magnet (magnet)
She say she got a man, as if that shit mattered, uh
If I was here then I just couldn't be madder
Excuse my manners, me and Spitta we just wave up the scanners

[Chorus: Curren$y]
Roll up every mornin' and then we get down to the 'ish
Plottin' how to murder these motherfuckers 'fore they kill us
Street's on fire, I'm still one of the coldest niggas
Dollar sign eyes, young and you gotta have them visions
Dollar sign eyes
Roll up every mornin' and then we get down to the 'ish
Plottin' how to murder these motherfuckers 'fore they kill us
Street's on fire, I'm still one of the coldest niggas
Dollar sign eyes, young and you gotta have them visions
Dollar sign eyes
