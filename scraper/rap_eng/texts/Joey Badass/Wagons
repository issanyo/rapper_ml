[Hook: Smoke DZA]
Shout out to all the bad bitches with the wagons on ‘em (you, and you, and you)
Shout out to all the bad bitches with the wagons on ‘em (you, and you, and you)
Lookin’ very very, very very very nice
Lookin’ very very, very very very nice
Lookin’ very very, very very very nice
She’s a maxi dress killa

[Verse 1: Smoke DZA]
Shout out to all the bad bitches with the wagons on ‘em
I ride your back I be the captain on this trip
Work of art on a Mona Lisa tip
I bust yo ass and send you home, your man’s a simp (niggas a weirdo)
Ain't nothin’ illa than fuckin’ in the villa, maxi dress killa
Word to mother I love it when you wear bright colors
The main reason that I like summer
Sip on patreezy get right from it
Style on all the hoes that might front it
Now your stock’s up type wanted
Boost your attributes if you’re type ugly
Low on the web, Instagram followers light hundreds (like 430)
Mi amor, whether you short or tall, slim or you butterball, natural or you bald
Light skin, dark skin, all of y’all
Smart or the dumbest broads, I swear that I love ‘em all

[Verse 2: Joey Bada$$]
Yo, shout out to all the bad bitches with the wagons on ‘em
Like to hit it from the back with the Magnum on me
Grip, just in case she try to let a nigga slip
Uh, never trust a bitch
You can try your luck, I’m gettin’ fired up
Mami talking to me crazy like she fuckin’ wired up
So I took it out my pants and her hands went right on up
Drop that shirt off where you standing, step right on up
Need ya give me what I need and
Get down on your knees and
Tell me "Lord Joey, you the one that I believe in"
If you move fast then I just might start squeezin’
Bust it in your mouth piece til you’re not breathing
But enough of that shit, let’s get where the cream is
Young and ready for action and baby girl’s a genius
So surrender the booty girl, it’s your last chance
That’s when she says, “your wish is my command” and I’m the man understand, yup
