(Fabolous)
It's the homie LoSo so you know so
BK to The Bay
(Keak Da Sneak)
Kafani Baby
(Fabolous) Yes
(Chorus)
Fast like a nascar nascar nascar(4x)

Hey yo my life is like a movie, good role so far
Stick to the script, You can be my co-star
I got a glow ma, should be into solar
Where you get it from Fab? I don't know even know ma
We played Lo Bar on the dance floor nah
V.I.P.s where the dudes gettin dough are
Rap star, trap star, ball player, pro star
Reach for the stars that's the way to go ma
I'm in the cut the one that leave no scars
Dark shades by D I O R
They watchin me they know a fella dope, It's like star gazing with out a telescope
Clean as the rims are, sharper than gem stars, We runnin' on mills like we in a gym ma
The papers thick but now its getting slim ma
Faster than Anna Nicole did on the trim spa
(Keak da sneak)
Fast
