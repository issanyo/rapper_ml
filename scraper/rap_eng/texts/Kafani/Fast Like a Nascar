Fast like a Nascar Nascar Nascar (Repeat 6X)
Fast like a Nascar; fast like a Nascar
Fast like a Nascar; fast like a Nascar

[Verse 1: Kafani]
I'm fast like a Nascar
Ice like a superstar
Up and down the boulevard
I get gouda man
You ain't fast like my 3-point shooter man
21s on 351 cougar man
I get stupid dumb di-d-dumb
Ice King, baby, and I have plenty fun
I go 18 since I was 18
I got more chains than the nigga from the A-Team
Sideshows, ghostride the whip
Hey lil momma go on shake them hips
Go on shake them hips, what it do?
Ride glasspacks 24's on the shoes

[Hook]
Fast like a Nascar Nascar Nascar (Repeat 6X)
Fast like a Nascar; fast like a Nascar
Fast like a Nascar; fast like a Nascar

[Verse 2: Keak Da Sneak]
Eeerr, sidewayz, this way that-a-way
With a gallon of that muthafuckin Tanqueray
On my way to get the Cut dawg lifted
Slap these Marshall Faulks on so I don't hit this bitch
Yeah hoe, all in the doe
The money and the dimepiece rims are spinnin whaddi-hittin fo
Winnin don't know how to lose
She choose she tearin it off if she do
Knockin but stock, holdup, I done fucked around and blew a fuse
Circuit breakers, want my mule and 40 acres
I break it, shake it to the curb
That's my word, I'm just crumblin herb

[Hook]
Fast like a Nascar Nascar Nascar (Repeat 6X)
Fast like a Nascar; fast like a Nascar
Fast like a Nascar; fast like a Nascar
