[Verse 1: Priceless Da Roc]
I like the bad bitches, that's what I'm into
When it comes to getting money, she knows what to do
She asking diddy hela pretty with the whole crew
I let the hammer come nail her yeah she getting screwed
She got a job and her own car
Roll up the bars so she fuck like a pornstar
She vip when she step in
Killing these hoes, she's a close like a weapon
And the pussy good, its the wettest mama
The streets is like a runway and she a primadona
Them red bottoms, all the bad bitches got em
When you spot em, all the real niggas want em
Yeah, I don't do it for the ratchets
I do it for the ones that be glamorous
Do it for the stuck up girls with an attitude who act vicious
So if you're looking for the kid

[Hook]
You can find me with the bad bitches
And I be chillin with the bad bitches
And I don't do it for the ratchets, I do it for the bad bitches
Sippin my dranks, hoodie on me
Sippin my dranks, hoodie on me
And I don't do it for the ratchets, I do it for the bad bitches

[Verse 2: Kafani]
Real from the hood, made her way out
Living off a nigga being played out
You can miss her with that lame ass trick shit
So spend stacks on the make up and lipstick
Red bottoms, you know she got em
The Gucci Louie Prada never been a problem
Flexin on them ratchet ass hoes, in a 9 debetty you can't roll
See I'm on a flow, bad bitch patrol
Nose up, bitches telling thirsty nigga no
Stuntin on them no, running through them stacks like a dope boy
Good job, new porno, no boy
Broke hoes, can't hang, broke niggas get fake numbers fake names
She know the difference from a thrill and a fuck nigga
She don't wanna drink, whole click bottled up nigga

[Hook]
You can find me with the bad bitches
And I be chillin with the bad bitches
And I don't do it for the ratchets, I do it for the bad bitches

[Verse 3: Beeda Weeda]
Need me a bad bitch, fat ass, long hair, thicker than the average
Ballin like the mavericks, stuntin in the rarri
Baby from the far east, every night she party
Hennesy, Bacardi, sexy call her Barbie
Baby is a dime piece, 20 on the time piece
Get money, shake ass, swag swerve on the day get cash
I'm a boss bitch, love a boss chick
Make hela green cell thick boss thin
Still a trick like base is lofting
Super sexy though, mama is a quarter piece
Never ratchet though, we keep it crackin ho

Sippin on patron counting money cause we '
