[Verse 1: Kafani]
I'm Swervin' on em', I'm Swagged out
VIP Knocking bitches throwing cash on 'em
Popping Rosay, with the aces fade,
Three bad bitches and they going both ways
Off a couple molly, with a bad body
And that pussey wet like a tsunami
Swerve, Swerve, and I'm ballin' baby
Big booty stupid judy and im swagging baby
It's your birthday, got stewart cage
It's your birthday girl let the haters
Hate
Call a timeout, with a referee
Turn your swag on and baby come and swerve with me

[Hook]

Kafani baby, I'm swagging on 'em
Super cocky and these chicks like to brag on me
Move in sachi with the bag with the tags on 'em
Bad chicks like some like some cap money
Swerve swerve, in that rari baby
Hop on dick the ride it like a harley baby
Hella rappy when im stacking with them bands on her
Stupid booty I'm run it going ham on her
Money long
Cash out
Blowing cookies you a rookie bout' to pass out
Got a groupie wanna do me with her ass out
Let her blow me in the building in I'll bass out
