[Chorus: Kafani]
She's tryna play hard, I get it
Meet me at the car in five minutes
And bring your friend if she's with it (with it)
Both of ya gonna get it
'Cause I knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down
'Cause I knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down

[Verse 1: Gucci Mane]
It's Gucci!
Tryna play hard, I get it
Got good game, I spit it
Wanna bring a friend? I'm with it
Oh that's your girlfriend? My bad, I hit it
Like when it's gushy I twist it, let's go out, let's kick it
You still runnin' shops in my city
And I can't even lie, you fly and I dig it
Call me when you ain't busy
Two bad bitches, they're kissin'
One I will go they miss it
I'm the one they call for the late night visit

[Chorus: Kafani]
She's tryna play hard, I get it
Meet me at the car in five minutes
And bring your friend if she's with it
Both of ya gonna get it
Cause I knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down
Cause I knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down

[Verse 2: Bobby V]
I love chicks, I get chicks, I keep me a bad bitch
I ride with ya's I take, I brag, I got it
Bentley, got it! Bright lean, got it
Chick I ride it, dick, she ride it!
Baby, bring your friends in here, she a nympho
Backstage stripper, baby-girl really get dough
I'm a knock it down, oh really really beat it up
She ride me like a six stick, make me skeet, eat it up
Momma is a full when it comes with the sex talk
Met her at the bar with her friend and we crap up
Sex where we left off, they both got a big ass
Funny baby, got the ladies, yeah I keep okay

[Chorus: Kafani]
She's tryna play hard, I get it
Meet me at the car in five minutes
And bring your friend if she's with it
Both of ya gonna get it
Cause I knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down
Cause I knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down

[Verse 3: Bobby V]
Pull up, valet, new whips foreign
Two chick foreign, Rosay pourin'
All the ladies on me now when I got them too
Baby catch me next time, you could get your issue
I ain't playin' no games girl, I'ma knock that pussy down
Eat it up and bend it over, I'ma go a hundred rounds
Girl bring your girlfriends, girl flickin', girls too
Got a nice tongue ring and some good pearl too
Model type, designer type, baby really light it right
Funny baby, got the ladies, giving money every night
Head game proper, rolling stone like a rocker
Gotta have two girls, baby girl bring your trap to me

[Chorus: Kafani]
Hard, I get it
Meet me at the car in five minutes
And bring your friend if she's with it
Both of ya gonna get it
Cause I knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down
Cause I knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down, knock 'em down
