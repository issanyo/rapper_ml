[Pre-Chorus: Vic Mensa]
We was broke but we had heart, I knew from the start
Niggas fall down but we never fall apart
They be screaming "pick a lane" I don't know
I be swerving on them hoes, I been workin' on my soul
I ain't perfect but I know that I deserve it (Ayy)

[Chorus 1: Vic Mensa]
I put the work in, I earned it, I did this shit on purpose
I know I'm fuckin' worth it (Ayy)
Even when I'm feelin' worthless, underneath the surface
I know that I deserve it, whoa
I know that I deserve it, whoa
And I know that I ain't perfect
But I do it with a purpose
One thing is for certain
I know that I deserve it

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
17, see my name written on a star
Lookin' up  too high to crash my momma car
Had to get it on my own a la carte
Built this shit up outta heart like a house of cards
They been praying on my death
Not a threat
Still alive and in the flesh, Southside, it's on my neck
I can't fail, I been in hell way too long to hold my breath
Now I'm rackin' up them W's like Wonder Woman chest
I see 12 and I'ma step I never did a 12 step
I need power, transformation, I need miracles in fact
I need miracles in fact, got a miracle, she black
I been workin' like my grandma she got scars upon her back
Now, I'm lookin' down, the top is lonely
You can't count me out they countin' on me
I'm the number one, the one and only
And if you know me, then you know that I deserve it (Ayy)

[Chorus 1: Vic Mensa]
I put the work in, I earned it, I did this shit on purpose
I know I'm fuckin' worth it (Ayy)
Even when I'm feelin' worthless, underneath the surface
I know that I deserve it, whoa
I know that I deserve it, whoa
And I know that I ain't perfect
But I do it with a purpose
One thing is for certain
I know that I deserve it

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Since 17 she been workin' (Ayy)
On the pole but she know her purpose
She do it on her own terms, she determined
Gotta make her earn it; she know that she deserve it
Use to serve it, he turned into a addict (Damn)
Now he spend his re-up on a habit
Being broke alone is hard enough to manage
Make money but the money never made me
Had to move back in my momma basement
Ugly, he was sleepin' in the vacant
'Fore I started writin' on the gang shit
You know how fame just change situations
Tryna live up to my reputation
All I gotta do is be amazing
Coolin' with the gang, celebration
Get the champagne 'cause you know that we deserve it

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Ay, you put the work in, you earned it, you did this shit on purpose
You know you fuckin' worth it (Ayy)
Even when you're feelin' worthless, underneath the surface
You know that you deserve it, whoa
You know that you deserve it, whoa
And you know that you ain't perfect
But you do it with a purpose, one thing is for certain
You know that you deserve it

[Outro: Mr. Hudson]
Two hands if the world is yours tonight, it's good to be alive
If you're not ready to die, then reach up for the sky
Forget about all of your problems, leaving it all behind
I know the walls are high, but you deserve to fly
