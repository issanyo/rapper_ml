[Intro]
It's like my favorite beat
This like one of my favorite Nas songs ever

[Verse 1]
This shit bring me back to when I first started spitting
When I was 15 thinking a life that I was living
That was back before I had it when I didn't
Before I made a mixtape and all of my shit was written
It was written in stone that I was the one to be home
To come back, claim the throne, now these niggas is gone
Their mind blown whenever I step up on on it with the shotgun
They be thinking about ''what the fuck Vic gone drop, son?''
And next I'm in Texas sipping Texas tea
I washed my rollie in the sink
You ain't got the chance to Memphis blink
Open your eyes before you try and disguise
They tried to play me, most of this rap shit is lies
I see 'em Shady, but now I'm on Shade 45
I mean, they try to understand how the nigga kick it live
That's off the top of them, most of them be hypotheses
They try and come through, but they ain't stopping 'em, I'm dropping 'em
Rocking them hard like granite, understand it
Keep the mic like Janet while I'm spinning like a planet
They be planning their freestyles, my shit is unhanded
I backhand it, you get smacked for trying to act rude
Yeah, something like that

[Verse 2]
What's next is the checks
If you worry about me you need to go and call your ex
Hop on the phone line, I got niggas Drake-ing
Most of them phonies, they be faking
The time I'm taking on my shit is not minuscule
That's why every time I do a fucking interview
I'm like ''please ask me something new, this shit is boring''
Money I'm still storing, hoes they still whoring
Ain't nothing changed except the number after the dot
Ain't got no range, but I bet I got my work on the block
My bitches tried to trip off flip switches
Like a '64 I can take it back to Death Row
They try and play me like a fake, but that shit ain't real
I'm from Chicago where they put the stony mill to your homie grill
I think somebody said that before
But I ain't worried cause I'm still up for that hit when I flow
Most of them they don't even know how to go with them
That's why I put them on the table, dust them under the dable coasting them
I meant to say some other shit, but my brother it
Shout out to Joey Purp, you know that that's my brother, Vic
I'll always come through on some frat shit
And then Statik Selektah be like ''what's the next shit?
So I check another one off of my checklist
And then I skip to the exit
I need a diamond across the necklace
So next time I come through New York City I'mma be straight flexin'
Empty out my wallet, pockets ain't lookin' skinny
Like you getting smacked
What was that movie he was in it?
It was uh, Ludacris was
When Skinny Black threw his motherfucking tape in the tub
On some bullshit, you know they give me love
But I keep a pocket full of money
Blunt full of drugs, I don't even do the raps though
I'm the asshole, when it comes to it I be about cash flow
She wanted to play me, she look like Lazlo from Monsters Inc
I dropped my rollie in the sink when I said I was washing it 5 bars ago
Obviously it's not that hard to flow
And if you Google my name it's not hard to know
That I'm probably the hardest one spitting on the star board though
I'll throw them of the ship, niggas get sunk
Down in the dirt when I'm coming and I'm jumping
Fuck niggas trying to talk crazy like they something
They know they ain't nothing, they systems ain't bumping
I keep it rocking like that on some old school shit
It's off the top of my hat this shit
Say that it's obvious I trap cause my wallet getting fat
Her booty looking nat so you know that I'm back
And hit it from that angle, she played you
Bitches' shade you cause you a lame dude
I ain't worried about them, I be riding in the Range 2
In the rain though with a kangol
That's the bucket, hid a stain though
For the fame though, ain't worried about them
He said Trinidad James need to watch out for Maino
He sending you to the doctor's office, they be talking
Often in time they be lost in
Most of the time that they be coming off of they neck
It's too easy to put them in check, so go to the next
I break 'em like pretzel sticks
Vic Mensa's  next to get subject in the predicate
You better get back before you niggas get smacked
I ain't worried about none of the school rules, I'm still flipping the packs
I used to have them in the locker, had the olds for the fold
Than I moved up to the QP, 16 a mole
I ain't worried about that, but had to keep it on the low
I was in the studio
I ain't even let my mama know the drama though
I ain't even try to see that, believe that
Cause niggas get beat black, if you try to play like you light-skin
Team with me, I ain't playing with them
Every time I'm ripping on the mic then, frightening
Niggas keep running in fear
Every time I'm popping shots like a gun was in here
But still I ain't got no strap on the waist unless it's Magnum's in my pocket
Back to her face then I'm splat, splat, she cat', that on her face
Then I'm leaving, ain't leaving a trace
Fuck the bullshit, I'm on some new shit
Useless rappers be talking out of they neck, but never do shit
I'm on some cool shit, just lay up in the cut though
Like I be proofing when I fuck hoes
Cause I just chill, sit back, she gone pop a pill
And do my dicksack, that's my nuts, balls, cut, pause
Jump draws and then duck halls
I used to be in school acting a fucking fool
Now these days I only break the fucking rules
When I'm...catch me in the county
I caught a little case going over to Toronto, couldn't catch me for the bounty
My head be on the table, they waiting on me
Cause I'm horsepower stable moving through
Just cooling dude, who you worry about?
Ain't me cause I ain't new to you, or new to this
She a nud-a-ist
And she trying to proclaim like she a Buddhistess on some newer shit
But still sound like your old shit that sound like my old shit
Niggas don't know shit, they politicking
You gotta listen, I ain't talking bullshit, I'm about the business
But fuck the business cause the industry be wack
And niggas be be wack, but still they be talking as if they hot
And when they react it's all the same
I ain't worried about them
In the game it's plain to see that I came to free
Came to be, I'm really like the king to be
More like a prince
More like a prince when she dripping
And I'm sipping on that purple rain
