[Hook 1: Liam]
Darling I still love you
Oh darling I still love you
I know that my feeling's still strong
That's why I've been running up your phone
Open your eyes and tell me the truth
Because darling I still love you
Darling I still love you

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
They say love is a losing game
I'm a winner so I'd rather not participate
If it ain't in court, then I ain't tripping if I miss a date
Boy I spit that crack, mayne I could be moving this in weight
And as for the low, I'm killing the competition
I often get'em and forget'em, can't even help it
I used to get that feeling, as of late I haven't felt it
I'm something like myself, so these hoes say I'm selfish
On that rookie bull like when Derrick Rose played the Celtics
But I'm off that
And now these little ladies wanna take notice
The pot sitting on the dock, I awake Otis
I used to sit up on the stoop sipping grape sodas
My Mamma be on my back but I got straight shoulders
Stand up, go and put your hands up
If your homie's smoking something go and light your man's up
And we could encounter before they mess our plans up
And these girls wanna act anonymous until they bring the band up
Like

[Hook 2: Macie]
Know that my feelings still strong
That's why I've been running up your phone
Open your eyes and tell me the truth
Cause darling, I still love you
Cause darling, I still love you

[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Yeah, yeah, and you can blame it all on me
I'll take credit for what you're scared to
Better than them rappers that I shouldn't be compared to
Say we blowing up, I'm only trying to be prepared to
Loud got me cornered, wonder where do I disappeared to?
Listen, in the thin air, but I ain't having trouble breathing
They say a nigga taking off 'fore my shuttle leaving
Out of this world, got a joint rolled up
And even without it it's pearl(?)
Riding with my girl, bumping Slum Vill'
Stupid sick, I said I'm dumb ill
Boy, I'm trying to make it, I ain't signing under 1 mill'
Son chill, chill I'm taking it back back
I'm keeping it trill than candy paint on a 'lac 'lac
The nigga to mack mack, I'm posted in the cut
One hand on the itchy(?), other hand on her butt
Yeah, I said I'm posted in the cut, one hand on the itchy, nigga what what what
(I ain't going nowhere son)

[Hook 3: Liam and Macie]
What can I say, I'm here to stay
What can I say, I'm here to stay
Oh darling I still love you
Oh cause darling I still love you
Cause darling I still love you
Don't you know that I love you?
Cause darling I still love you
Oh cause darling I still love you
Oh darling I still love you
Don't you know that I love you?
Oh darling I still love you
Oh cause darling I still love you
