[Verse 1]
Coffee and cigarettes
Remind me of you, babe
You pick me up in your old Buick station wagon
With the radio broke
I'd roll the window up
You turn the AC on
Who knew you'd be so cold?
Newports burnin' on our lips
A shootout in the background as I told you that I love you
A gunshot to the heart couldn't have hit me as hard as you did
As hard as you did, no
Ash my cigarette
Waitin' for your response, it burns slowly as a spirit
Who knew you'd be so bold?

[Chorus]
You were only 17
Fallin' in love with everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me
These cigarettes is burnin' like a dream
And all this money heals everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me

[Verse 2]
We wrote our names beneath the bridge
To be sure that the city never forgot us
Who woulda known you'd be so quick to forget about me?
I guess that's memory loss
I wish you loved me as much as weed
Shit, even half as much as weed
I know you love to smoke
Marlboro 27s were your favorite
Only thing you loved more was your little sister
I hope she never grows up to be as fucked up as you did
Fucked up as you did, oh
Light my cigarette
Like we did when we were young
Who knew we'd grow so old?

[Chorus]
You were only 17
Fallin' in love with everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me
These cigarettes is burnin' like a dream
And all this money heals everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me

[Verse 3]
I recently realized I'm a hopeless romantic
I ask a lot of questions, but I'm not open to answers
And all of my girlfriends just fall into the same old patterns
Like sudoku puzzles we cross words, spoken in anger
I must be the best at turnin' the good girl crazy, that's like my strong suit
'Cause every time we should be breakin' up I'm right there on cue
Like a pool stick with some bullshit 'bout what I'm goin' through
You should have an amber alert for me, I swear they should have warned you
I mean, young rap god, what do you expect from me?
And women are like a greatest hits album, they get the best of me
I give 'em my all and then forget to call the next morning
I used to play my tape in the passenger while she bend corners
She was only 17, first girl that broke my heart
Now I think I take it out on every girl I take out on
Dinner dates, to somewhere nice to sit like Rosa Parks
Guess that's just the way it is, it all ends the way it starts

[Chorus]
You were only 17
Fallin' in love with everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me
These cigarettes is burnin' like a dream
And all this money heals everything
Except for me, except for me, except for me
