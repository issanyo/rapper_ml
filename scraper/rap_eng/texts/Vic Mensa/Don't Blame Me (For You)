[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
I'm larger than life, hard with a mic
When you talk to me gotta send a car with a kite
(Stay high)
And I trip too far for a flight
See me in the sky like stars in the night
Draws to the right
Got mad when you tried to bring claws to a fight
Ain't no shore [blank], apartment, or height
Ain't no shine, I bring heart to the light
S.O.S. can't move, no sight
Sipping that Sprite
So rock if you've ever seen me sipping that pint
And we out here tripping all night
But they got locked up for that fight though
Ain't trying to get fucked though
If you're tryna get fucked
We can show you what's up though
Watch what you say with my name, or get blamed

[Hook]
Don't blame me
Don't blame me
Before you own up

[Bridge: Vic Mensa] x2
I still see you dreaming
When I'm home you know I miss you
When I'm here, I hear you aren't even happy
But I'd be (happy happy)
Hold on

[Musical interlude]

[Hook, revisited]
Don't blame me
Don't blame me
For you
Don't blame me
For you
Don't blame me
For you
For you

[Outro: Macie Stewart]
I, I want you to be with me when I die
(For you)
I want you to be with me when I cry
I want you to be with me when I fly away
(For you)

[Outro: Macie Steward & Liam Cunningham]
I, I want you to be with me when I die
I want you to be with me when I cry
I want you to be with me when I fly away (from here)
Oh I, I want you to be with me when I die
I want you to be with me why I cry
I want you to be with me when I fly away from here
Oh I, I, I want you to be with me when I die
I want you to be with me why I cry
I want you to be with me when I fly away fly fly
I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- I-
