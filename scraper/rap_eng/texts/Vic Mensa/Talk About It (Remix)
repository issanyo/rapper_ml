[Verse 1: Erik Hassle]
This girl doesn’t love people first
So don’t celebrate
She’s over you in just a minute
This girl likes to leave you
‘Cause the space in my bed burns
Will somebody relieve me
But this ride is something else
It takes me out the game
This ride is something else
But baby...

[Hook: Erik Hassle]
I don’t wanna talk about it, no
Then nothing would be beautiful between us
But baby, I don’t want to think about it, no
Just let me know what you would call this thing between us, baby

[Verse 2: Erik Hassle]
You sitting in front of me
Talking about how you feel
You say let’s go back to your place
A moment it all feels real
Like if you would never leave
Then I see it in your eyes
You carry all these lies
Living life in disguise
You fucked me up inside
But this ride is something else
It takes me out the game
But this ride is something else
But baby...

[Hook] (X2)

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
Forget the dress hanging on my bedroom wall
She wish we never got involved
A million nights, I’m never home, weekends is never off
All fingers pointed, so pointless seems like we set it off
Oh, goddamn there she go again tryna set it off
Right on time, wouldn’t be like you to be a second late
Almost crashed my car arguing on the phone with you
On my way home to write this shit yesterday
Let’s say there’s nothing left to say
At a loss for words you take my breath away
When I was on the edge it’s like you stood and held my heartbeat
Pouring tears in the rain as I fumbled to find my car keys
The star seems shifted, got me feeling like the end is different
Spinning myself around in circles, tied up in indecision
Long distance calls and missing conversations
Time wasted, spent on bitches that you think that I was chasing
Why would I run from sunshine right in front of me
Shit been crazy, I been wanting to get away
I was wondering would you come with me?

[Outro: Erik Hassle]
Then nothing would be beautiful between us
Just let me know what you would call this thing between us, baby
