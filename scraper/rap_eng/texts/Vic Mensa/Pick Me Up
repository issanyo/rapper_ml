[Verse 1: Vory]
Come on, true love give me one more chance
I feel my time is running through your hands
Come on, that boy don't stand a chance
Heard that before, so he took up and ran

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Pick me up, a mile from town
Lost the key, heart broke down
Pick me up, a mile from town
Lost the key, heart broke down (pick me up)
Pick me up (pick me up), a mile from town (pick me up)
Lost the key (pick me up), heart broke down (oh-oh)
Pick me up (pick me up), a mile from town (pick me up)
Lost the key (pick me up), heart broke down (oh, yeah)

[Verse 2: Kelly Zutrau]
Come on, true love, give me one more chance
Feel my diamonds running through your hands
Come on, that girl don't stand a chance
Heard that before, so you took up and ran

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Pick me up, a mile from town
Lost the key, heart broke down (oh-oh)
Pick me up, a mile from town
Lost the key, heart broke down (pick me up)
Pick me up (pick me up), a mile from town (pick me up)
Lost the key (pick me up), heart broke down (oh-oh)
Build me up, just to break me down
Ride for me, I need you now

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
I feel like I'm at rock bottom
Don't let me hit the ground
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up

[Outro: Kelly Zutrau]
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
You can pick me up
