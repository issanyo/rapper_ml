(Intro)
Sitting at home on a Friday night wit' nothing to do
(I know you ain't got shit to do)
Would you rather be Solo Dolo or come and fuck with the crew?
(Why don't you come kick it?)
You can come through the studio, I'll sing my Chicago blues
(I know you love it when I hit those high notes)
Baby, if you let me tell me something I could make you move
(What about your name on snapchat?)

(Hook)
What's your name? Where you stay?
What's the scene like?
Whatcha say? Whatcha say?
Would you stay right here?
Run away
(You want it, you got it. You want it, you got it.)

(Verse 1)
Back at it, like it's magic
Patrick Kane, that's a hat trick
Southern California cabbage, I'm climbing out the attic
Party on the roof
Shoutout to my nigga Rufio
Bitches in the the crib oh
I got keyboards in the studio
I could play you something
She said "Prove it," though
Truly though, "I'll fuck the whole crew,"
She said she ain't a groovy ho
Groupie love, me and  Smoko pullin' up, on four loco
Traffic going locomotive
Reach out for orange soda
Tanqueray, Cody got a couple models
Started from the bottom, you know we ain't forgot it
I'm from where the shorties shoot and Martin Luther [?]
[?]
Bitches think I'm in the movies
Now I'm with the team
And we out here actin' stupid
Came a long way: from those lonely days in Massachusetts
She said she don't drink
Oh cool boo, I ain't trippin
All I wanna know is

(Hook)
What's your name? Where you stay?
What's the scene like?
Whatcha say? Whatcha say?
Would you stay right here?
Run away
(You want it, you got it. You want it, you got it.)

(Chorus)
I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin cuz I'm big time pimpin
[x4]

(Verse 2)
My niggas say I’m tripping
My bitches think I’m pimping
So many people so close, but I just feel distant
Like where would everybody be in a year?
If not here, would I get rich enough to not care or say fuck it?
I blew through a hundred racks I’m a young thousandaire
A money blowing box, grabbing dollars out the air
Come here, you and your friend both of ya’ll look like Beyonce
She a 7, together ya’ll a dime that’s three the hard way
I’m riding around with no top, cruising around til I get sick
Swear I’m blowing this pen, smoking all of my shit , my shit, my shit
Out here, I’m bumping all of my shit, my momma said get a grip
[?]
No, I gotta come with that hot shit
Make em start a mosh pit, all I wanna do is rage
Go out like a candle, in the sun, in the blaze
Hate all you want

(Hook)
What's your name? Where you stay?
What's the scene like?
Whatcha say? Whatcha say?
Would you stay right here?
Run away
(You want it, you got it. You want it, you got it.)

(Chorus)
I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin
I ain't trippin cuz I'm big time pimpin
[x4]
