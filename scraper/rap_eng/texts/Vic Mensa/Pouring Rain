[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
He never knew his father, the only home he had was the block
Crack in the sock, just a rebel with a hand full of rocks
Cadillac on D's just like Pamela Anderson's top
Had to have a knot to fill a void from not having a pops
See, his old man was a dope head, never had J's, just PRO-Keds
Mother worked all kind of jobs, broke her back tryna provide
But the local smack dealers outside who he idolized
When they bang, the disciple signs light up the night like fireflies
He wanna be them, so he gotta be in, anything to numb the pain
Only 12, serving fiends, soaking in the pouring rain

[Chorus: Emmit Fenn]
And I hope that we can face this together
Any city, every weather
In the line and in the pouring rain, in the pouring rain, oh
And I hope that we can face this together
Any city, every weather
In the lightning and the pouring rain, and in the pouring rain, oh

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
He never knew his son, how to be a man and teach it to his son
He ain't have a father, that shit come back like karma
He ain't have a job or income tax, he barely knew his mama
She was 16 when her water broke
Tryna get a starter coat, not start a family
He never had a plan or a plan B
He was sent overseas to fight Afghanis
And came home addicted to the candy
How could you champion a child
When you trampled to the ground?
Gotta have it, you can't navigate around with a GPS
He seen a shorty standing at the CVS
He knew he had work, he seen it in his eye like CBS
He walked up to him, shorty said, "What you want?"
That's when he realized he was buying crack from his own son

[Chorus: Emmit Fenn]
And I hope that we can face this together
Any city, every weather
In the line and in the pouring rain, in the pouring rain, oh
And I hope that we can face this together
Any city, every weather
In the lightning and the pouring rain, and in the pouring rain, oh
