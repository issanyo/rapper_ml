[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Twisted silence
Please decipher
We can still try
We're too young to die

[Verse 1: Mr. Hudson]
So much for the fail safe
Wrong way down the runway
This scene's playing over
I can't think when I'm sober
I hear what you don't say
My heart beats like a freight train
This place doesn't feel the same
Is this the part where I walk away?

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Twisted silent
Please decipher
We can still try
Too young to die
Shoelaces tied
Taxis outside
We can still try
We're too young to die

[Verse 2: Mr. Hudson]
But long walk down the old street
They sipping sundowners on concrete
But me, I need something stronger
I guess I thought that I'd be stronger
Wet hair on a cold day
The kind of day you play Coldplay
I don't even like Coldplay
But today I need Coldplay

[Chorus: Mr. Hudson]
Twisted silent
Please decipher
We can still try
Too young to die
Shoelaces tied
Taxis outside
We can still try
We're too young to die

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
I left you in tears at the airport
Crying inside but I ain't make a sound
It's ironic, not even tears say could save us now
She's breaking down
We're breaking up, my Lady Luck, my favorite love
I think because I can't give up, the way it was
It really hurts us more than things that we don't say
I see your face in yellow every time I hear Coldplay
And your place on the pillowcase where you don't lay
In a bouquet of roses I left in your suitcase
Before I screwed it up and made you screwfaced
I think about you every time I hear sad songs
On New York Radio in yellow taxi cab songs
My mama told me many glass homes should be passed on
I left you by your own, now I'm grown and I don't wanna die alone
The twisted silence, relationships and violence, shit was childish
I lost my queen, pop and ace of spades, king of diamonds
Just to be honest, you was always fixing me
Now I don't know what else to do, but listen to "Fix You" on repeat
I hate Coldplay

[Outro: Mr. Hudson]
The hardest part of moving on
Is really letting go (taxis outside)
I know you gotta find someone that I don't wanna know
The hardest part of moving on
Is really letting go (taxis outside)
I know you gotta find someone that I don't wanna know
No, no, no
