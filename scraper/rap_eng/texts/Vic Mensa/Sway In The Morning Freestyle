[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
I spit that ugly face like a dude had a bad mood
Pussy blew it, bud clot when the act rude
Trying to flex and get embarassed like a baboon
Birds I don't feed no seeds till I be posted on the porch like a raccoon
Rap funny, they tried to
Play you like you soft or portray you some type of trap goon
I'm from the hood, to be exact 47th
For shorties'll catch you lacking, you carried and buried under wood
Six men'll hold your casket
You only come off the bench to take a stand, you a snitch, witnesses get subtracted
I'm back to where I began and that's to pass your exit
As far as first impressions I'm breaking the mold


[Verse 2: Mibbs]
Better call your best troops, we let loose
All OE Tropicana with the best juice
At this moment every moment is a chess move
I see your chances getting slimmer than a test tube
To walk like I walk you need your best shoes
But sorry I don't walk no more, call me JetBlue
You couldn't get at me if I let you
Cause everything I spit is nasty like pet food
Atchoo, eww, that's rude
This neighborhood was never easy to pass through
Give me the order and I'mma get to slaughtering
This year I make careers shorter than tattoo
It so happens I got a shitload of talent
Line so thin you gotta tip toe to balance
There's nothing in the world I've ever been so proud of
But my first mixtape, that was my first mistake
Cause the second one was stupider, what could you do to us?
You down to earth niggas, we reside on Jupiter
And you could've thought of something lucrative to do with us

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
After the band, before the bands I never really went solo
I always kept a cup of niggas with me
Taking shots, better hit your mark
Three come for you, it might get sticky
Like a drunk Santa dropping his Henny down the chimney
Smoking Christmas trees, Happy New Year
Knew I was the future before the present
They questioning if I should move out of the city
Really ain't much left to do here, but I'm still here
If you on a wheelchair then come pop a wheelie
Traffic, traffic looking through my taxes
Been traveling so much I got out of state rates
Overseas plates shift the parentheses, different brackets
I'm Freddy fire starter you're more like bury the hatchet
Shush your mouth, you don't wanna smoke
You hide behind the mirror, scared to look yourself in the eye
I know you fear me, it's apparent
Like a mother of five trying to feed her family
Your food on the table [?] the chef [?]

[Verse 4: Mibbs]
Yo, it's black shades and black beanies, feel me?
Cut the track and put it out, call that a freebie
All the girls wanna dance and rub their titties
They only got love for hundreds, fifty's
My Compton niggas is rocking Dickies
Hollywood niggas is rocking skinny's
As long as you niggas is rocking with me
I could give a fuck about that sucka shit
My shit got slapped
Who's that creeping down peek hole like that?
Really in a golf chair leaning like that
And I'd catch a case if I beat it like that
Girl, I remember you, you used to be a sleeper
But when the sleeper go to sleep that's when they meet the reaper
Hennessy and reefer, just leave it to Bieber
Quit talking about your dick, bruh, that shit never please her

[Verse 5: Tokyo Shawn]
It's SaveMoney, save money to the grave money
It's really nothing you could really take from me
I know my wave coming
I'm off the top more often than not, what it gave for me
Like, you could take me to the grave something
I'd probably take something, but they could never wait for me
I see them gaining interest, that's late money
Now that wave coming
I dropped the coffee, but I caught it, quick action
But I'm never lacking in the field, but I'm always packing
If they asking I'm tough acting [?]
I'm playing Madden, but slacking
They always slacking and macking 'em
Probably off of the top with it
And they just changing all the topics
Something like it's tropic, but I'm never stopping it
And now I'm off with it

[Verse 6: Vic Mensa]
Probably off of the top with it
Back in school, selling a fool, that was hypotheses
Now I'm in Jamaica, I be out where the tropics is
I just took my girl to vacation, they still waiting
You still late, can't even get your late pass
But I'm right back cause you know I'm smoking great grass

[Verse 7: Tokyo Shawn]
I said, who, I said it's Tokyo
If I don't remember your name, sorry, don't get emotional
I mean I'm wavy, I'm probably gonna make the lake overflow
I mean I'm wavy, I'm wavy, I'll probably flip a motorboat
I'll probably go and overdose
Off on some shit I never did before, I'm indigo
I mean the G's did it indigo
You can't even find them in the go
I'm off the top with it changing the topic
I mean I'm Philosoraptor with it

[Verse 8: Mibbs]
Show love to the ratchets
Hit the suburb for that white girl action
Know your sports, nigga, know your fashion
Know that you don't give a fuck, you tell a nigga what's happening
All day, Merrill Lynch, marijuana, Mary everything
Kill the game and the mic, explode everything
Shout out to Sway, shout out to Tech
Shout out to my ladies, shout out to the respect
I come through with a freestyle verse

[Verse 9: Tokyo Shawn]
In the morning with Sway, in the morning with Sway
I'm with Vic, yeah my homie [???], where's Trey?
SaveMoney, here the take of the day
Here to save the day, take over the global shit
I mean I'm new to this
And they just see me walk in the room, they probably noticed it
Bun in they hair but probably open it
See the girl getting legs open, something like the [?]

[Verse 10: Vic Mensa]
I'm in the back of the black Uber and you know I'm smoking it
These other niggas is lame, they do not be poking it
They lying on they shit, that's why bitch be steady be steady lying on my dick
Like I had a frying pan on my shit
Because I'm steady in my kitchen whipping water when I'm across the border, tried to get me dirty
My boy thirty, I'm twenty, I'm about to come up, money coming up plenty
And they can't see me, can't defend me, can't [?] me, automatic [??], clac-click him, clac stick him

[Verse 11: Tokyo Shawn]
All the 90's babies, 90's baby
90's made me, the 90's made me, the 90's raised me
Me and Victor, we in the [?], we off the mixture
We off the [?] of the jeans, ain't got no zipper, the hell we saying

[Verse 12: Vic Mensa]
She got an iPhone five, I wanna take a picture
Now I'm sipping on that purple potion, that elixir, (that elixir)
Look, these niggas know that Vic get live
That's why I got three nights this week at Terminal Five
You can catch me from Toronto, and all the way to Montreal

[Verse 13: Mibbs]
Hitting your sister
Individual spitter
Big Mibbs that nigga
Pac Divsion is my crew
I'm with Vic Mensa, you know how we do
We on this shit, south by southwest, come catch me
Me and Scoop DeVille, on a jet ski

[Verse 14: Tokyo Shawn]
See the face up on the poster, me and Vic we on a tour with Disclosure
And they see we light it up, changing the exposure
Tell them that I'm kosher, tell her come closer
Tell them [???]

[Verse 15: Vic Mensa]
Tell them [???], you know they spotlight is over
Me I keep a cold glass of wine on the coaster
If you looking on the mannequin, you can see my name on the poster
You know they over, you far but I'm closer
Closure, shoutout to [?], she never get (shoutout to Hova)
Shoutout to Jay Hova, [?] at the United Center

[Verse 16: Mibbs]
Shoutout to Weezy, shoutout To Yeezy
We do this shit so easy, the freestyle's like peasys
Easy, cleasy, niggas don't understand I'm like Georgia Weezy
What's happening, niggas done rapping
Spitting, kicking, clapping, guns clapping

[Verse 17: Tokyo Shawn]
Clapping never lacking
[??], he [?], what did he say?
What did he say, she say, they saying that cliche
But they be rapping and they be talking and never say shit
It's okay because we almost famous

[Verse 18: Vic Mensa]
We in this bitch [?] cliche, I be sipping that [?]
Shoutout to Donnie Trumpet, that's my brother Nico
And my stock up like the NASDAQ
Niggas no answers like Sway in the math class
Back that, pass that, you know I'm [??]
I'm ash on the gas then pass out
When she at my crib give me ass then I pass out
People last up or last out

[Outro: Sway]
There it is, there it is!
Yo, I want the end, on that last metaphor
Vic Mensa, give it up for Vic Mensa!
Give it up for Mibbs!
Tokyo making his debut on Sway in the Morning!
Yo, that was one of the sickest, that was the sickest cypher this year!
