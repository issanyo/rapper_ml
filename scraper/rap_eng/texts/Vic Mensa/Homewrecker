[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
She said, "Everything you say is a lie, I text you and you never reply
Sometimes I wish I woulda been with a regular guy
All these years and you gon' string me on like that?
Like a puppet and Gepetto when you know I'mma snap
You don't understand the power that you have to affect me
Could use it for good, but you'd rather neglect me
You keep pulling me back like a Chinese finger trap
I try to let go, but you just won't let me"
I guess that she could sense the sex in the morning
Judging by the way she kept texting and calling
Phone blowing up, you say you never ignore me
She found a rubber in the crib, she got the evidence on me
Damn

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
And that's my fault, I made mistakes, G
I knew you was crazy, but not this crazy
And still I opened the door, I shoulda known better
But who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker?

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
She flipped the kitchen table and broke a water glass
Screamed, "Bitch, come out here, I'm coming for yo ass!"
I screamed back like, "Please stay in the bathroom
Whatever you do, do not leave the bathroom"
She in the room, ass out like a baboon
Looking extra hot like a vacay in Cancun
My girl tryna swing on a nigga with a damn broom
Now look at the mess we made, baby

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
And that's my fault, I made mistakes, G
I knew you was crazy, but not this crazy
And I opened the door, I shoulda known better
But who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker?
Damn, the wifey and a homewrecker
Who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker?
Shit

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
I knew you was crazy, I knew you was crazy
But goddamn, who'd've ever thought we'd take it this far
We like to get drunk and get pissed off, but this, dawg?
My chick start ringing every buzzer on the wall
Fienin' on a nigga like an addict in withdrawals
My other chick hiding in the bathroom in her drawers
And me, I'm in the middle just like Malcolm in the hallway
Like, "Please, don't pull a fuckin' stove out the wall, babe
I knew you was crazy, I knew you was crazy"
She said, "You don't know what you do to me, baby"
I say, "I do," she say, "You don't," I say, "Let go," she say, "I won't"
Now we wrestlin' in the kitchen, "How the hell you get so strong?"
She pull the dressers out the cabinet, all the knives fell on the floor
Whoa, I drive you crazy, but you love that shit
I'm looking down at the knives, "Please, don't cut that bitch
I mean, she ain't know I was yo nigga" (open up!)
She like, "It's time to go, nigga, peace"
And then police come in the crib, looking all out the window
And shorty come out the bathroom, mad as a schitzo
I wanna speak to her, but as a minority
I had to hide the weed first, that's a priority
It feels like Love & Hip-Hop should be recording me
10 minutes later and we acting so cordially
I got shorty a car, you came back to the door
I knew we hit rock bottom as we laid on the floor

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
And that's my fault, I made mistakes, G
I knew you was crazy, but not this crazy
And I made it happen, I shoulda known better
But who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker?
Damn, the wifey and a homewrecker
Who'd've ever thought you'd be the wifey and a homewrecker?
Hehe, I knew you was crazy, but not this crazy

[Outro: Rivers Cuomo]
A homewrecker, a homewrecker
I wanna go back, a homewrecker
A homewrecker, a homewrecker
I wanna go back, a homewrecker
