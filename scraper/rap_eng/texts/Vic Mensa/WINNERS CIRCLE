[Intro: Joey Purp]
Yeah
Turn the beat up a little bit, keep my voice with it though
Welcome to the winner's circle
Uh, Purple
Yeah

[Verse 1: Joey Purp]
I done seen, niggas that was eatin' together fall off the table over bitches
It ain't personal nigga you should be handlin your business
Closed mouths get open the barrel of burners put in them
Closed eyes get led through the darkness
I need a witness ridin' by myself
I ain't worried about you niggas, tryna find myself
Vision's blurred how about you niggas try to change your fate
You killin' niggas in your hood, you the KKK?
What's the difference between you and them?
Boys in blue and the boys in white
I used to be with them
Boys in blue sellin' poison white to my own folks
Ridin' through my old hood but I'm in that new whip
Same old burner it got a new clip
Everyday, new young nigga dead on the news clip
Every hood, same old niggas don't ever do shit
Every dollar stuck in my wallet I'm running through shit
Before I be a deadbeat father I hang myself, on my mama
I done seen, niggas sell drugs to their own blood
I done see cowards snitch on niggas in they own hood
I done seen kids steal drugs from their own parents
Just to start a habit that they would inherit
I done seen, real niggas fall victim to the fame
I done seen, bitch niggas get rich and get a name
I done seen, the same person in the mirror everyday
And my vision gettin clearer everyday
You take a little Biggie and a little Big L
Add an adolescent on the corner with packs to sell
You take a little Em and Andre 3k, and guess what you got
The 2016 2Pac, back and improved
Back from the dead back on your ass, back in my groove
You couldn't walk a step in my shoes I been that dude
Ask around the city they see me it's nothin new, and they done let the wrong niggas in the room
Real nigga, lets get it

[Hook: Vic Mensa]
Champagne, champagne, champagne, welcome to the Winner's Circle
Welcome to the winners circle
All of your problems don't mean, don't mean, a damn thing
When you in the winners circle
The top feels so much better than the bottom

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I woke up this morning with a fever for life
A liver full of patron, half a belief in the Christ
Flights from New York home, my bitch tweaking from nights
That I never answered the phone cause she always started a fight
I fought my whole fucking life, that ain't nothing new
Don't make me, don't make me, don't make me, I know they want me to
Become a statistic with my whip just like my chains
Just so that niggas can say I changed
Like I did all of this work to stay the same
I feel like David Blaine
Disappearing like the Mayans except a nigga made it rain
And I'm stepping out of Hermes to whip on angels wings
I'm climbing up the coast, I wonder if God flies coach
I wonder if Cam can really see me from my South By shows
I got my dogs with me, I keep a Rottweiler close
So if you thinking of running up, nigga wanna reach for my bread
Best be the gingerbread man, hope you can outrun the toast
Cause these bullets will leave you bleeding in a moat
Bitch I'm the king of my castle, I throw my queen on a boat
Fuck losing my balance, I'm in Miami with my talents
Fucking up the ballots
Vic Mensa for president, never claimed to be a reverend
I used to ride a bike on days that I was drug peddling
That hood medicine
Another victim of the drug sentencing
Lock him up make him a good citizen
We ain't breaking even we gon' win against all odds
So you gonna need an army against our squad
I hope you niggas been praying

[Hook: Vic Mensa]
Champagne, champagne, champagne, welcome to the winner's circle
Welcome to the winners circle
All of your problems don't mean, don't mean, a damn thing
When you're in the winners circle
The top feels so much better than the bottom

[Outro: Vic Mensa]
I know, I've been down that road
I've been there before
But days don't feel the same no more
And now we on, And now we on
When the world is on your shoulders everybody wants to know you
