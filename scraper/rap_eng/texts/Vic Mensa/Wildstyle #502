[Nick Cannon]
Skylar Diggings, Vic Mensa
Team [?] y'all light skinned
[?] you might get it
But I'ma keep on do it for sure
Why do he looks like a ElBlog Decor?
Unh, I'ma keep on running, this is freestyle Nick Cannon
Y'all can say what you want bihhh

[Skylar Diggings]
A football jersey? You ain't tryna rumble
When you drop an album, its more like a fumble

[Vic Mensa]
I guess it's all a joke, like its funny and cute
But why Mariah fuck around make more money than you?
[?]
Somebody tell me when did he let Lil Boosie outta jail?
[?]
Stop bombing jokes, that's a offensive subject
Stop it, I'll settle round his head
Nick Cannon still looks like he wanna be on Jagged Edge

[Hitman Holla]
Man I'll make this child drop, dont mattet if its fire shots
They'll found Conceited in the Chuck-E Dawg box

[Conceited]
No Chuck-E Dawg box can hold a big 80
I get fucked that ship maybe, I'm the kind type of twin cannons like Nick's babies

[Hitman Holla]
Nick babies, Nick babies, that's cool
Till i get the machine, and get a slick slice
I got cannon but when i lit it ring, it sing better than Nick's wife

[Conceited]
Listen, all that you better sit tight
You and your captain's a bitch
It got a full clip, I'm drippin' snipe
You can get all that, if I see Nick at night
