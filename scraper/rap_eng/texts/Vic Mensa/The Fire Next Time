[Hook]
Out of the fire I found a fire inside
You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost, through heaven and hell
They turn they back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga, I won't stop, now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now

[Verse 1]
It wasn't easy but I learned the hard way and let me tell you how
Lived life and learned my lessons
Spent dough and earned my blessings
Southside my tatted necklace
Ball like I'm ambidextrous
Every time they tried to block me
Switched hands and changed directions
Fist in the air like Rocky
Bitch I think my name Sylvester
That's the difference between me and them
When they thought it was the end, I was still tryna see a M
Now the difference 'tween me and them
Even in Mercedes Buick, I was still tryna see a Benz
I was backed into a corner, sat chasing, catching charges
It's re-election season, bitch I think I'm back in office
You don't know my pain how far I came
Those days are gone, you cursed my name
I prayed to God he shined the sun
He gave me rain, I took that water and walked on it
Marching harder than a million Martins
On my darkest days, I'm still a star; I shine regardless

[Hook]
Out of the fire I found a fire inside
You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost, through heaven and hell
They turn they back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga, I won't stop, now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now

[Verse 2]
And I thought they said light skinned niggas went out of style
Andr√© 3K said you only funky as your last cut
So I'm state to state in the act like a Mac truck
Plus I gotta keep the Mac tucked
For these big soldier niggas on the 'net trying act tough
Y'all too alternative, get your facts up
I shoot to heat throw, get my stacks up
I get pounds to spend this English
Bitch I think I'm bout to rack up
You don't get it do you? When you on the big screen
There's a lot of little people living through you
And when you don't stick to the script
They assassinate your character and act like they never knew you
That's just how the game goes I guess
Change clothes, I dress
Like Project Runway meets the projects
Write like Noah but a little more Complex
I fed niggas and they shitted on me
Took the piss out then spilt it on me
When I broke down like Britney Spears
Said they throw me, oops they never did it on me
So I wrote 'em out and made a bigger story
Vic's story, that's victory
Niggas never did shit for me
Show them the ropes and they jumped ship on me
But I never drowned, stayed down
Sang songs for my home town
Made homes for the broke kids
Stepping over needles in the playground
Y'all the only thing that matters to me
If y'all love me fuck everybody
If y'all love me they could never stop me
If y'all love me they could never stop me

[Hook]
Out of the fire I found a fire inside
You can see the pain still alive in my eyes
I've loved and I've lost, through heaven and hell
Turn they back on me too many times to turn back now
My nigga, I won't stop, now
I can't, I can't, I can't stop now
I can't, I can't, I can't be stopped now

[Outro]
I gave you my pain through pen
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin
