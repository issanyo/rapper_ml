[Verse]
Barrack sold us hope, Ronald Reagan sold us dope...
...When Kanye signed to him
They had the game in a choke
We were overnight celebrities then
In elementary at the top of century
Right in 2006 when thought Chicago was everything
Lake Shore Drove felt like the clear port I let my skateboard fly
I was reppin' up rhymes when Lupe did Kick Push
That's when I first hit my grind, hit the kick flips with crooks
Hit the Kush in my Nike SB's, make a serve
Skate off like Gretzky, check please, now let's see
This was when Twista was the shit
And Common was common sense
Sammy Sosa had hits
[?] Habit was the kid
For a kid from Chicago that was jets on my back
See we never left, but I'mma put us back on the map
This is Chi-town pimp shit, west side limp shit
BB King blues, I rock like Limp Bizkit
