[Intro: Steppa J. Groggs]
Lately, I feel like I've been losing my mind
I've been losing my mind, mmm
And every now and then I feel like I'm fine
I feel like I'm fine and then I start slipping
I keep on slipping
I keep on slipping  (said every now and then when)
I just keep on slipping  (said every now and then when)
And then I start slipping  (said every now and then when)
I keep on slipping  (said every now and then when)
I keep on slipping  (said every now and then when)
I just keep on slipping  (said every now and then when)
I keep on slipping (said every now and then when)
I just keep on slipping  (said every now and then when)
And then I start slipping  (said every now and then when)
I keep on slipping  (said every now and then when)
I keep on slipping (said every now and then when)
I just keep on slipping (said every now and then when)
I keep on slipping (said every now and then when)
I just keep on slipping  (said every now and then when)
And then I start slipping  (said every now and then when)
I keep on-

[Verse 1: Steppa J. Groggs]
I'm losing it, really feels like I'm losing it
Sad thing is I ain't doing nothing to improve this shit
Some days are better than others, feeling distant from my brothers
I almost lost control and choked my baby's mother
But I checked myself, thank God, I checked myself
Always helping others but I just can't seem to help myself
I just can't help myself, nothing to be concerned about
Listening to Amy, I ain't going either but we know how that turned out
Then the homie Josh OD'd, I'm thinking to myself that could've been me
Just turned 28 but my liver's probably like 73
This ain't the life for me, ain't feeling like the man I'm supposed to be
Thought having kids would make you tame
I've been doing even mo' drugs since my daughter came
My momma's gonna hear this and feel so ashamed, so ashamed

[Hook: Ritchie with a T + Steppa Groggs]
Uh, uh-uh, yeah
And then I start slipping (every now and then)
Uh, uh, I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
Can we restart? ('said every now and then)
Cause things be hard ('said every now and then)
And we need our niggas ('said every now and then)
Yeah, we need our niggas ('said every now and then)
We need our- ('said every now and then)
Keep keep on, yeah ('said every now and then)
K-k-keep on it ('said every now and then)
Cause we need our niggas ('said every now and then)
Yeah, so k-keep on niggas ('said every now and then)
Cause we need our- (light it up, baby)

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa + Steppa Groggs]
And then I start slippin'
Do you know what it feels like to be at war with yourself? I do
My mental issues going on and on, I feel like Badu
Can't seem to shake this shit, I can't even take this shit
Sometimes I fucking hate myself, I swear to God, I hate this shit
I think I need a "Hitch", the way I ruin my relationships lately
We used to vacay in Jamaica, now Jamaican me crazy
Fighting with my baby girl, turn us to exes quick
Now we've been tryna break it back like the Exorcist
And I be stressing shit so much that this Effexor don't work
I would switch the medicines, but I did Lexapro first
Feeling sceptical, sometimes I think my blessing's a curse
The same depression made me anxious is what gave me this verse
But every time I think of making it work, it gets worse
And then I start slippin'

[Chorus: Steppa J. Groggs]
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I just keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I just keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I just keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I keep on slipping ('said every now and then)
I just keep on slipping ('said every now and then)

[Outro: Richie with a T]
Keep, on (keep on slipping)
Keep, keep on (keep on slipping)
K-keep on it (keep on slipping)
Cause we need our niggas (keep on slipping)
So k-keep our niggas (keep on slipping)
So k-keep our-
