[Verse 1: Malcolm London]
Been a lot of places except for home
Rocked a lot of stages, no stepping stone
Skipped a lot of school, my lessons learned
When cops kill us them courts adjourned
Did I forget to mention that I'm from the westside?
Where sunset 'round five, and quickly turn to dark skies
Cross-eyed cross country, my city feel like apartheid
Where showin' love feel like a part time job

[Pre-Hook: Malcolm London]
Kids can't go to the playground
Can't tell Chicago from Capetown
Young Nelson Mandela with a cape on
Straight from K-town
I don't wanna go right now
I just wanna learn right now
Northstar from the westside
Wear a lot of hats, but they don't let hats inside
Picket sign in my afterlife

[Hook: Maceo Haymes & Malcolm London]
I'm like, how you gonna change the world?
(How you gonna change the world?)
(It's already ending)
(Where you gonna place your bets?)
How you gonna change a world that's already ended?
Where you gonna place your bets when you're so far from winning?
How you gonna win if you ain't right then?
How you gonna win if you ain't right then?
How you gonna win if you ain't right then?
How you gonna win if you ain't right?
How you gonna win if you ain't right?
You ain't right, you ain't right

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
They tell me Vic go save the world
Save your money, don't sell your soul
Save your family, don't save yourself
Dropped outta school, saved by the bell
Just a hot boy trying to make it out of hell
Locked in a cell trying to make it out of jail
In 360, trying to make it out a deal
Industry slave trying to make it out the field
But we in the house like Will
They tryna kick us out like Uncle Phil
Did Jazzy Jeff, land on the steps
Next time I step hand on a nine mill'
A man can't eat then a man gon' steal
A man can't dream then a man gon' drill
And scream GD till the world blow up now
We're just waiting on the world

[Pre-Hook: Malcolm London]
Kids can't go to the playground
Can't tell Chicago from Capetown
Young, Nelson Mandela with a cape on
Straight from K-town
I don't wanna go right now
I just wanna learn right now
Northstar from the westside
Wear a lot of hats but they don't let hats inside
Picket sign in my afterlife
I'm like

[Hook: Maceo Haymes & Malcolm London]
How you gonna change the world?
(How you gonna change the world?)
(It's already ending)
(Where you gonna place your bets?)
How you gonna change a world that's already ended?
Where you gonna place your bets
When you're so far from winning?
How you gonna win if you ain't right then?
How you gonna win if you ain't right then?
How you gonna win if you ain't right then?
How you gonna win if you ain't right?
How you gonna win if you ain't right?
You ain't right, you ain't right

[Verse 3: Malcolm London]
Call me Malcolm X from Alcatraz
Pulling exodus from out the trash
Did a lot of shit, don't like to brag
Teaching for the kids who failed the class
Change starts by putting first whose last
Take a couple steps and learn to dance
Damn, damn, damn, damn
Martin Payne or Martin-dreamland
Just tryna' learn to be a man
Just tryna' learn to be a man
Startin' with myself, I've got a plan
Put your hands up if you with it
(How you gonna change the world?)
Malcolm X-caliber, change your sword
Black Power Ranger, mighty morphing dinosaur
Better take your time, it's the only thing you can't afford

[Sample]
How you gonna change the world?
It's already ending
Where you gonna place your bets
When you're so far from winning?
