[Verse 1]
Can you wait for me baby
You the only one on my mind
Summer nights turn cold as winter
When you're not by my side
I don't care if I look crazy
Nevermind who's been in your bed
Do what you like with your body
I live in your head

[Chorus 1]
I-I-I ye-e-eah
That's some that's real as rain
That's some that's real as rain
We don't need to talk too much, I can't even explain
I can't even, it's something metaphysical
I can't even explain it, I never go explain
I know you feel it too
I can't even explain it, I never go explain
I'm just feelin' right

[Verse 2]
Can you let down your armor
I know it's to guard your heart
Made a fight for you like soldier
You're a prisoner of war
Lay my cards on the table
I hearsay love is a losing game
May I shoot my shot
Never go explain

[Chorus 2]
I-I-I ye-e-eah
That's some that's built to last
That's some that's built to last
Baby, I don't need it to make sense
I can't even explain it
I can't even, it's something metaphysical
I can't even explain it, I never go explain
I know you feel it too
I can't even explain it, I never go explain

[Bridge]
I been, I been here, you been there
But I'm always there
Let me know if you get this
Loving you from a distance
Let me know if you hit it
I don't care if you hit it
Come alive when he’s not there
I’ll sneak through your window

[Outro]
I can't even explain it, I never go explain it
I can't even explain it, I never go explain
I'm just feelin' right
