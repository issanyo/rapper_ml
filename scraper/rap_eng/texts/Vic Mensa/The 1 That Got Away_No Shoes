[Part 1: The One That Got Away]

[Verse: Vic Mensa]
I can't see it coming down my eyes
But I gotta let this song cry
I gotta let you know this been on my mind for a long time
But the cat had my tongue
When we were young I told my dogs
You should be having my son
But after one too many van tours to endure
Illusions of grandeur, I left you hanging just like a jury
You were my first love, and you just became secondary
I was busy chasin' pussy like Tom runnin' from Jerry
And that's ass backwards, I know
Like an asthmatic who smoke
I flashback to the laughs we shared, broke as a joke
Not a care in the world, together we prepared for the world
Backstage at On The Run tour
And I'm there with my girl
By my side when I sign my deal, wavin' hi to them dollar bills
We couldn't buy a meal, now I was worth about a mil'
That shit went to my head like a Sudafed
I used to drive a car to move my Buddha
Now they know my name in Budapest
My money got older, I grew up less
And I do confess, I broke your heart
Like a sledgehammer through the chest
Tryna be known in this music mess
I left the one that knew me best, I left the one that knew me best

[Chorus: Charlie Wilson & Vic Mensa]
Let'It l meet birdwthe adle (Can we go back?)
Go back in time just a little
When you were mine, a little (Can we go?)
Just like old times, just a little (Just)

[Part 2: No Shoes]

[Verse: Vic Mensa]
Five eight, six feet with the heels on
Used to be my rhythm but we lost the tempo
Even when I'm writing, tell me what I did wrong
Treat me like I'm gone every time I get on
Remember when I put you in that new Benzo?
How you gon' be mad that I'm off a benzo?
Should've kept your ass in the fuckin' friend zone
Maybe I was in a different time zone

[Chorus: Vic Mensa & Charlie Wilson]
'Cause I can't find the time for you, let you tell it
Know I woke up blind for you
I never change my mind for you, it's true
Just to keep my eyes on you
But you love to run your mouth, don't you?
I would run a mile
When you know I'd run a mile for you, with no shoes
I'm addicted to you baby, oh
'Dicted to you baby, addicted to you baby, oh
