[Intro]
Yeah
She don't need no reason
She don't need no perfect
She don't need no season
She don't need no darkness
She don't need no evening
She don't know no warning
All she know is she love me
All she know is she love me
She don't need no question
She don't know no answer
She don't need no mission
She don't know no bastard
She don't know no sadness
She don't know no laughter
All she know is she love me too much to ever leave

[Hook]
So don't leave
So don't leave
So don't leave
All she know is she love me
All she know is she love me
All she know is she love me too much to ever leave

[Verse]
Innanet, yeah
She be cross country giving all that she got
I be on the road too busy to pick a phone
When she hold up at home stomach balled in a knot
Question herself whether to call up or not
Rose petals on the floor when I pull up
When I pull up say let's vacay in the villa
Van Morrison dancing in the moon like Thriller
Margiela pumps in the back, chinchilla
So it seems I thought I patched the fabric when I cashed it
Golden ring, depressed diamonds from the ashes, I left in the tray
When I left the other day, I left her laid back on the mattress
Imagine me being the asshole ain't difficult
She's bashful, so typical
Good girl being intertwined in this wild life of mine
But I'd be lying if I said she ain't ask to

[Hook]
So don't leave
So don't leave
So don't leave
All she know is she love me
All she know is she love me
All she know is she love me too much to ever leave

[Outro]
She don't need no reason
She don't need no perfect
She don't need no season
She don't need no darkness
She don't need no evening
She don't know no warning
All she know is she love me
All she know is she love me
She don't need no question
She don't know no answer
She don't need no mission
She don't know no bastard
She don't know no sadness
She don't know no laughter
All she know is she love me too much to ever leave
