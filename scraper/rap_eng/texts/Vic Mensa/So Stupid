[Verse 1: Sir Michael Rocks]
I'm d'ing em up, car European as fuck
My nigga James on parole gotta pee in a cup
He be smoking on them roaches ain't no weed in the blunt
He just caught another case, I hope he beat it because
I was just talking to his mama the other day and she told me
That she be praying for us but we be living unholy
I stay sipping, stay popping that gold shit
Straight crissin', I'm rapping, I'm rolling
It's eight bitches, I'm mackin, I'm hoping
My weed man sell more weed than he smoking
Rollin' up an ounce on the iPad 3
I'm an ocean to a puddle, you are not that deep
If you ain't talking 'bout the paper then I'm not gon' speak
Lookin' like the town mirror walkin' out my suite
I'm on Keith Sweat, goin' Bobby in the 650
Off the molly and the kush finna get trippy

[Hook: Sir Michael Rocks]
Uh
Pretty penny on the boost bitch
The hard liquor with the juices
If she ain't fucking then deuces
Got damn you so stupid

[Hook: Vic Mensa]
Got damn you so stupid (2x)
Drop top riding no top where the roof is
(You stupid as fuck) Got damn you so stupid

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
They told me take it there, I accept the offer
Closed Sessions so I could show 'em what I had to offer
I see these niggas mad, I'm stacking like CJ Walker
These girls just wanna have fun like Cyndi Lauper
I'm painting pictures so come get you a portrait
They married me to the cash, don't ever plan to divorce it
I'm riding with Mikey Rocks now, tight as new corsets
Blue Porsches with the white stripes, call it blue orchid
Get ya facts right, hit it then I'm skating like a half pike
The bitches getting left if them bitches don't act right
Macbook flick with just the back light
It's me and Sir Michael on the rocks like Jordan on the crack pipe
Deuces Deuces oh Deuces Deuces
Heard you got some hoes with you? Introduce us (introduce us)
I'm a nuisance, they know I go stupid
See me bumping Chaka Khan in the rain like Rufus Ruthless

[Hook]
