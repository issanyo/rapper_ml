[Hook]
Egyptian cotton
Egyptian cotton
Egyptian cotton
Line that skirt baby
Line that skirt baby
Line that skirt baby
Line that skirt baby

[Verse 1]
Put your lip to your nose, put some stank in it
Like you're sippin' on a cup full of paint thinner
Shout to O-Dog, I'm a straight menace
Boy I ain't playin', I'm in the game and it ain't a scrimmage
INNANET, ballin' on the net like table tennis
Where to start? Push to start, that'll make the finish
Beast, hedge funds, I'm a head hunter for the bread though
Comin' up fast like Sonic on Sega Genesis
Vic aren't you excited? It's like you live a dream
Gettin' paid to be on the pages of magazines
Zetus lapetus, I might just take it to the moon
Mushroom cloud in the room when I make a boom
Hold your neck, put your hand like a surfboard
Say you want, say you want, then let me see you twerk for it
Turn around, back-back like a workhorse
Work, work, workin', hundred thousand thread count

[Hook]
Egyptian cotton
Egyptian cotton
Egyptian cotton
Line that skirt baby
Line that skirt baby
Line that skirt baby
Line that skirt baby

[Verse 2]
Gold ring, two C's on the frames
[?] from the straight A's, that's a 4 point range
Used to hustle out my locker, now my locket turned to chains
Same hood, same fake I.D., different name
I'm the INNANET, where my dinner at?
You little boy, centipedes on the Similac
Repeat that like [?] with a tennis racket
It's red rubies in my dinner package
Pair of new dentures when you're eatin' like it's old money
Ears ringin', I think they talkin'
YouTube on fire cause I'm pushin' buttons like I'm tryna load somethin'
It's madness, he's a beast, he's a savage
Hold your neck, put your hand like a surfboard
Now ride it, ride it
Turn around, back-back like a workhorse
Work, work, hundred thousand thread count
