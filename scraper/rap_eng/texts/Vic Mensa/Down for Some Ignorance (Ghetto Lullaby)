[Intro]
Yeah, I know you down for some ignorance
Yeah, yeah you see me on the internet
My life is down, my life is down
Yeah it's down in the ignorance

[Verse 1: Chief Keef]
Sosa Baby
Coolin' on the block and we down for some ignorance
No love to the opps cause we down for some ignorance
I just bought a Glock cause I'm down for some ignorance
My mans just got popped, now I'm down for some ignorance
Scream "Fuck the police" if you down for some ignorance
Turn up on CPD if you down for some ignorance
Fo'nem ride around and you know they with the shits
Might pull up on your block, let it blow in this bitch, get

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance (get 'em!)

[Post-Chorus: Joey Purp]
Don't forget the heat (watch out)
They might catch you lacking (watch out)
On 47th Street (watch out)
By your mama address (watch out)
Rock you right to sleep (watch out)
Like a little baby

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Gotta keep a strap on me like a straight jacket
Bitch I might go crazy!
Tuck your scary ass in bed
I'd like to sing to you a little ghetto lullaby
Grab your gun and light a blunt and pop a pill
And put a middle finger in the sky
Two niggas in a black Toyota
With a strap that's loaded and I can't control 'em
Ready for a game of Texas Hold'Em
Meaning they ain't no joker
And they might poke ya for that white Sammy Sosa
Catch you lackin' on your granny's sofa
Home alone and he 'bout to roll up
He don't know we about to roll up

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Up for revenge and I'm down for some ignorance
Run up in his crib, lay down all the witnesses
Finna take a ride and we packing, it's a business trip
Me with the cannon in my hand, can you picture this?
Down

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
Hide my pain in the past
Behind my face in this mask
Foot to the gas, buck on the dash
I might spaz on your goof ass
Don't make me blast, shit come off safe
If you don't open the safe
Totin' an eight, open the door
Open his face, with this vase
Blood on the carpet, no conscience
Beat a nigga like a 808, so heartless
Ran out the back door of the apartment
Stash the bloody gloves in the garbage
These nightmares turn us into monsters
Memories on 47th Street haunt us
You a ghost, fuck around wit them fuck-arounds
You can fuck around, get smoked

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance (get 'em)

[Post-Chorus: Joey Purp]
Niggas on ya head (watch out)
Wanna see you bleedin' (watch out)
They just took a L (watch out)
They gon' make it even (watch out)
They know where you live (watch out)
They gon' catch you while you leavin'

[Verse 4: Vic Mensa & (Joey Purp)]
Is that a face in the staircase?
Bitch I might be tweakin'
Listen to the voices in my head
Welcome to my fucked up reality
Ever since you did that home invasion
Cause the universe can feel ya energy
Mentally ill, fuck Dr. Phil
All these pills ain't Benadryl (Chiraq)
No oil but it's been a drill
Let me show you how the jungle feel
Lions, tigers, bears (oh my)
Tryna dodge the feds (watch out)
If the National Guard was actually hard
They wouldn't be scared (Southside)
And these kids grew up with no moms and no dads
Blew up with these rhymes and notepads
Even if they did they'd dopeheads
One a one way street to nowhere
Everything to prove with nothing to lose
You fools at FOX News
Couldn't walk a block in our shoes, they'll lay you

[Chorus: Chief Keef]
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance
Down, down for some ignorance (get 'em!)

[Outro]
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down (memories, memories)
