[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Tippy-toed in through the back-door basement
Picked up the pistol off the shelf
Shouted in pain tripped on a plug hit my head on the freezer
Hope someone comes down to my rescue to help
It's hell in the kitchen
Burning hot, turning rocks to the Pyrex pot
Cooking crack synthesis my shit too hood to gentrifix
The illuminatis didn't invite me to their pizza parties
So i pulled the brake through the brake lights on a (teen?) Ferrari
Rocking off a rocket, rock a band with my Vega Vodka
Spilling pill popper pocket description has Victor's doctor
Diagnosed overdose so don't dabble drugs i'm addicted
Dip my blunt in
My butter's worth double cup in my (diction?)
Dick in my hand i dont trust no man
Manic depressants steppin with the devil like
Holding hands in a square dance with Uncle Sam
Something know when they comin you better off running
The harder the hotter the flame is the deeper the burn
Im burning the bitch, bitch i run it run it
Still keep it 100 ive been
Off the top like, Kenna climbing the summit, what is
This hip hop shit, honestly its a joke cause
Most of these cats be talkin can catch a, to the throat
Obviously it's a game
If they tryna come at me then they leaving hopping in pain
Dropping a name is the best thing you could do
If you step to my crew it's obvious im next to be
Blew, blow up, show up and get destructed
Destroyed, ahh deconstruct, connected, disrespected get- something like that
