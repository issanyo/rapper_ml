[Hook]
Let me pick my face up off the floor, I'm off the D'USSÉ
I've been goin' so hard this week and shit it's only Tuesday
I left my bitch at home, I think I need a new bae
I left my bitch at home, I think I need a new bae
Pull up, pull up
I poured a drink, let's get twisted, get twisted some more
Yeah, better be good to me, baby
Girl, you better be good to me
I see your eyes when you look at me, I see your soul
I see your soul, you better be good to me, girl

[Verse 1]
Yeah, yeah, damn
She so bad but damn, she look so good everytime she get low
Yeah, yeah
I ain't E-40, but baby girl I'ma tell you when to go
Yeah, yeah
We skip the bed every time that we fuck, we get straight to the floor
Yeah, yeah, I'll buy the ticket, you get on the road
She says she live in Australia, I'll fly you out to Chicago
She doesn't like the cold weather
She wants a vacay, a vacay in Cabo
She got the frame of a model, I wanna ride like a saddle
I fell in love with a 5'7" stallion
Fresh out the shower, I'm lickin' your asshole
My new bae, you're my new bae
Let's make a movie, are we movin' too fast?
Who cares? You're my new bae
With my drinking I'll be on the floor

[Verse 2]
New bae, new bae up in Sacramento
D'USSÉ, D'USSÉ with the Amaretto
Wu-Tang, Wu-Tang when I switch tempos
Put you on a new game, get experimental
Have you ever had your ass in the air
Hands tied to the bed, legs tied to the leg post?
While your roommate watching, plotting
Playing with herself like who gon' get the head most?
We can do the three-three
Yeah, what about Kiki?
Bring her to the crib in the Hills with the studio
Tell her we can have a little FeFe
Make you feel a way
I'ma run my finger in a spiral up your spine like a staircase
You know that I know the right spot girl
How you doing squats girl, I can make your legs shake
Hit you from the back, make the bed break
When I beat the brakes off it, yeah yeah
Pussy getting wet, let it marinate
Let a nigga taste something girl, yeah yeah
(Oh!) You are fucking with a Chicago nigga like DJ Pharris say
Girl it ain't nothing to spend on a bottle
That's just cause your body the truth if I dare say
Sound crazy
I know I'm talking crazy girl, blame it on the D'USSÉ
But you look so bad if you're good to me
I might just make you my new bae

[Outro]
My new bae, you're my new bae
Let's make a movie, are we moving too fast?
Who cares? You're my new bae
With my drinking I'll be on the floor
