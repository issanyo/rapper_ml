[Intro: 24hrs]
24hrs
What I need from you

[Chorus: 24hrs & Vic Mensa]
I need your L-O-V (Love, love, love, love)
Need you to love on me, need you to love on me
I need your L-O-V (Love, love, love, love)
Need you to love on me, need you to love
I need your L-O-V-E, girl
Need you to love on me, love on me
I need your L-O-V-E, oh
Need you to love on me, need you to love on me

[Verse 1: 24hrs]
I've been waiting at your front door
We made mistakes but we should let 'em go
You had a dream, didn't turn your dream to mine
We said, "I do," baby, keep that in mind, yeah, yeah, look
Rain, rain go away
I wish my problems would just run away
You got a smile that could change my day
Wouldn't have it any other way, yeah
Let's hit the movies
Afterwards we go and get some smoothies
You just been showin' me, you not owin' me
Girl stop telling me, I need your L-O-V
Yeah, yeah, swear I need your L-O-V

[Chorus: 24hrs & Vic Mensa]
I need your L-O-V (Love, love, love, love)
Need you to love on me, need you to love on me
I need your L-O-V (Love, love, love, love)
Need you to love on me, need you to love
I need your L-O-V-E, girl
Need you to love on me, love on me
I need your L-O-V-E, oh
Need you to love on me, need you to love on me

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I need you more than me, on me
I need your trust most importantly, that's priority
I don't know why they say the best things in life are free, I disagree
We go Ludacris in Giuseppe, girl, what's your fantasy?
Let's make it reality
Good dick might make a bitch cry, mmh
That's when you know that it's real
Shawty say I can't live without you
Now she trying to jump out the ride
I'm doing 90 on Lakeshore Drive
I guess Jesus was holding the wheel, for real
'Cause I still drive you crazy
More than what you bargained for
I heard you got born again
I made you go find the Lord
Heard your man a junior preacher
I'm a Junya Watanabe, boy
I got your face tattooed on my body
Girl you know I never can forget you

[Chorus: 24hrs & Vic Mensa]
I need your L-O-V (Love, love, love, love)
Need you to love on me, need you to love on me
I need your L-O-V (Love, love, love, love)
Need you to love on me, need you to love
I need your L-O-V-E, girl
Need you to love on me, love on me
I need your L-O-V-E, oh
Need you to love on me, need you to love on me
