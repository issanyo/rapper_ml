I said pull up, flex

Eyes on us
You can place your bets
We goin' straight to the lean
Molly and the lean
Lean, lean, lean
Molly, molly, molly
Don't get out of body
Ooo I got gang with me
I got gang with me
Got gang with me
Got gang with me
I got gang with me
Got gang with me
Whole gang with me
I got squad with me
Whole gang with me
Got gang with me

[Verse 1: Towkio]
I said gang with me
I been outta body
Tripping off some molly
Or some DMT
Seeing things different to the point
I don't know no more
Heart cold: Alaska
Don't do it, cause I wanna do it
Cause I have to
I don't even know how I manage
Ooo I got Vic with me
That mean Ye with me
Mean Jay with me
Kim K with me
Beyonc√© with me
Team too strong
Don't play with me
I pull up at the party
Never say sorry
Y'all know me, MVP

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I got gang with me
That mean Jay with me

Save Money, got Kene with me

City notorious for niggas getting shot
It's not a movie scene
Do it big I got Faith with me, oh
That mean Puff with me
Nigga don't get tough with me
Like Sam Cassell

She do drugs with me
MDMA and the moon rock Yeezys
Cost you a stack but these 950
Save Money
She gonna do it for the freebie
Molly and the lean bitch

[Verse 3: Towkio]
And I'm with gang
So please be easy
I do it for my city
Do it cause they need me
Sitting here I'm like
"Feed me, feed me"
I gotta make sure that everybody eating
At the plate, it's squad on deck
By my side like an armrest
I can't hold them back
It get out of hand
You get stole off, Ron Artest
I don't wanna build with you, no
I'm trying to fuck all hoes
I need real sisters
Bitch I think I'm Bill Withers, whoa
Got that lean on me
Crack a seal with you
I don't want to chill with you though
Cause I'm cool and thuggin
In the same denim
Ain't shit changed
But the change in 'em
Know he brought the gang with him, ay
