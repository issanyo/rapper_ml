I was up like adderall
Got to get it all before school done
Spray paint on them icky walls
Had to leave my name on them buildings
Bad bitch with her titties done keep a apple with me like cinnamon
Me and Vic got em pissed off
More eight or theories than a pentagon
What they doing this Why they doing that
Rappers lie in raps
I do nothing but facts
If you wanna come and tango with me
Make em dance feet tango with the Texans
Yea I pour up every time I pour up
Got her pouring out so my boys take a sip
Last year my nigga bud
I've been all  drugs with my guns since
I ain't even want to hit your bitch I just hit the fifth so I had to bliss
Whole line of scrimage defense like
Warren Sap looking for the sack
See the pretense in you broke
