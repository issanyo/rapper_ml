[Hook]
Ain't no way I can't make it I would die before I ever let 'em take it
Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put your lighters up for me I'm blazin'
My teacher told me I ain't ever gon' make it wasn’t handed out shit had to take it
Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put ya lighters up for me I'm blazin

[Verse 1]
Don’t give a fuck about critics they can suck on my di-dick tell 'em I'm breakin' they rules
Doing this shit on my own so I guess now that I'm crown I got the duty to kill it
Turn this shit up in yo iPod feel it when niggas is locked up doin' digits
Pushin they way from they Civic hope that that you never forget it
I got you, you my brother forever where you are put your faith in me I'm shining
You can wish upon a star promise I won't let you down promise I'm gon' put it down
Promise I'm gonna rep my city everytime I'm outta town
I know a lot of niggas hate especially when I'm not around
But when I see 'em in they face I know they ain't gon make a sound
That’s enough of what you know about stories of the heart
How 'bout when a baby's mother sees a family ripped apart
The judge done threw away the key, he was trying to feed his son
There's only two things you can be: That’s dead, or dumb and with a gun
There's niggas dying every day it’s the Chi Town home of the gun shots
Where niggas try to look like Al Capone in they mug shots
City where the weather gets warm and the blood drops
Shot a shorty on his way home from the bus stop
Some one tell me when it ends lost my mind I lost my friends
All that I can think to rap about is candy-coated Benz diamonds shinin' in my chain
Ice gleamin' in my ring parasites inside my brain up in the club and I make it rain
Seein ghosts when I fall asleep - life is a game and it plays for keeps
Drippin' away and they say you weak - voice of the dead if they even speak
Sometimes I wonder what they say
Would you stand and listen to that shit or would you run away
Is you really safe up in your crib or is you one away the strike will hit you any day
Minutes movin' slow I pray I make it through the month of May
Summers commin round too fast
We still trying to get our head together of the last
When they took my nigga wish woulda seen him fore he died
We ain't no bitches but when we heard that shit you know we cried
Ain't that shit crazy, how just one moment can change me from my life
Had or dreams if I was dead wonder what that shit be like
Wonder if niggas would cry wonder if they know my name
Wonder if they think I'm happy, wonder if they know my pain
Wonder if they think I'm lame cause I never had a hit
Wonder if they talk about me then forget that I exist
For the kids that I'mma bring into this world, this is my apology
Your pops is headed for wrong, don't father me
And for the end of this song I solemnly
Swear you niggas can't stand side by side with me
This ain't rap, it's highway robbery
And I brought Chuck and Jay Dee for the ride with me
I own this shit, Chicago's my property
Savemoney standin, no toppin me, nigga

Ain't no way I can't make it I would die before I ever let em take it
Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put ya lighters up for me I'm blazin
My teacher told me I ain't ever gon make it, wasn’t handed out shit, had to take it
Nigga this is my life my story my pain my glory put ya lighters up for me I'm blazin
