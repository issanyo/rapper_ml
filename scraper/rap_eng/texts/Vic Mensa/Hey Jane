[Intro]
Hey Jane, hey Jane
I should have told you

[Hook: Mike Golden]
Hey Jane, what you looking at?
I wanna know what’s on your mind
Two long weeks I’ve been staring at you
I got so much shit to do, I can’t do you any…more
I know, the less I smoke
Take me to the river, watch me float
Cause I don’t want to see your face no more around my way

[Verse 1: Mike Golden]
Oh, you didn’t know I should have stopped that shit before
I made a promise to leave you
Ya don’t love me, I don’t need you
And you cause me amnesia
Or at least that’s how I’m feeling
Breath in, I’m at the ceiling
And I’m coming back down to figure things out

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Innanet, haha
Hey Jane, how you doin'?
Wouldn't even ask you about who you screwin'
I saw your Instagram rocking a baby bump
And bumped into your best friend Lauren
She told me all about your little guy
Said you dropped out of LP and went to Truman
Rantin' and ravin' about the music
Like how you pregnant and still choosing?
Bee-bop, something to make you move
Get in tune to the groove have you feeling all right
My right brain said to the left last dance
The Jack in my Coca-Cola, said let’s fight!
Why don't we do both?
You could scratch my back, I'mma scratch that itch
I'mma hit, I can’t miss, excuse me miss
Don't wanna be obscene, but wanna be my bitch?

[Hook]

[Bridge: Mike Golden]
Cause I can't really say when shit cools down
That I won't wanna taste you in my mouth
We got a long way before that cloud
We gon make

[Hook]
