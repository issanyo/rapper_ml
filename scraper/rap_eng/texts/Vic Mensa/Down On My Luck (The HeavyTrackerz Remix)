When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
When I get down on my luck I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood
They say ain't what you know but who you know
You need to know someone to know no one
When I get down on my luck
I roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome
Lost some years, I used to know
I know my fate like bullets in a shotgun

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
She loves to dream, living in and off and out her mind
In space and time, she takes a line & lies her life
Away you might just say she stays to go nowhere
Midnight scenes from an old romantic movie
Usually you'd be there today I say was different
I can take you with me wandering, if you wanna go there

When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
When I get down on my luck I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood
They say ain't what you know but who you know
You need to know someone to know no one
When I get down on my luck
I roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome
Lost some years, I used to know
I know my fate like bullets in a shotgun

When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck

[Verse 2: Meridian Dan]
When I get down on my luck
I've got man around me holding me up
Life might throw a quick jab to my gut
Mean time, I'm controlling the rut
A lot of this life is luck
You've gotta move quick, don't get stuck
It's mad what man will do for a buck
But I'm from London, I don't give a fuck
Got a few family with the stars and stripes
And I got big boy cars and bikes
Do mad stuff for a hundred likes
I love mashing up studio mics
I could've been in jail or dead
But I make music now instead
Sometimes I get down and see red
But I shut that off cause it's all in my head

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
When I get down on my luck
When I get down on my luck
When I get down on my luck
When I get down on my luck

[Link: Vic Mensa]
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
When I get down on my, down on my-on my luck
