[Verse 1: Towkio]
I said it’s on, but really that’s an insult
But it’s ok, they wanna get involved
I see their face, they’re goin’ through withdrawal
But we in here like ingrowns
So it's all good if they wanna get involved
See ya look around and look like your friends gone
So I’mma walk up, don’t ya dare try put me in the friend-zone
If you got a man or your friend don't, it's on
In this bitch, get it jumpin’ like a pinball
It's save money, but that dirty money get rinsed off
And somehow we feel like a wishbone
Down to gettin’ crackin’, I dunno what they’ve been on
I post like a big man, ball like I’m the sixth man
But you against me, that’s a mismatch
I’m mighty clean, I just said that, I’m a muthafucka
Goin’ crazy, flow wet, need an umbrella
Ok, I see you go ahead, go and make your stand
I ain’t got no protest
You trying to reach your goals and they tryin’ to goaltend
That’s the son of a gun, Goten, they a son of my son
Like oh God, I’mma break it down to the neutron electron
Proton, know you go hard, you come up in the city of the Gohan
Think you wanna put a coat on, tell 'em hold on wait

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Saturday night fever, you should be dancin’
So why you trippin’ like two left feet?
I just wanna make you sing, my dear
Hey, like do-re-mi, uh
Niggas got the game fucked up
But we came fucked up, you already know what the mission is
And my vision is, my position here
On top of you fucks like missionary
Me and Towkio make classics
For your yoga booty classes
Castin’ calls at the Beverly mall eating Kashi Crunch
Girl, ya betta shake yo ass-ets
I ask her if she been with her friend said no
Maybe so, Perry's at Lolla, I kissed a girl like Katy
No bands, but she says she heard me on the radio (ayy, ayy)
80 on GCI, heard of BBC
In my ice-cream shit like P but a lil more newer
In the future, frame so retro super
I don’t need a Lois Lane
I guarantee these hoes follow suit
Nah, I can’t be your superman
But I do SAVEMONEY that's crew, what it do
Aye

[Outro: Vic Mensa & Towkio]
Couple of girls wanna run that three
In the club finna close at two
We’re takin’ chances
Look how she dances, oh, like she wanna be involved
Oh, now they all wanna get involved
Now they all wanna get involved, now they all wanna get involved
Now they all wanna get involved, now they all wanna get involved
I said you, you and you, you should come get involved
I said you, you and you, you could come get involved
I said you, you and you, you should come get involved
