Hook:
You don't have to think about too much
What are you worried for?
We can get high
But don't get too high

Verse 1:
She was a watermelon sundae without the icing
Friday night life and the lights like Tyson
Type to never let you hit twice, like lightning
These nights I just get high and write with the [?]
Other times I smoke till I get too high
You acting brand new, I think you need a new guy
A good bitch wanna fuck with a rude boy
She used to be a church girl, Hallelujah
Now she gone when I get that back home
You taking too long, let me get back my phone
Come wind it up for me while I'm writing this song
We could sing R&B duet on my microphone
Like Ooh-wah, the one that finish my sentences
Know what I'm saying, you know soon as I'm thinking it
Curly blond afro, go put a kick in it, twist and pick it up and let it down

Hook:
You don't have to think about too much
What are you waiting for?
We can get high
You can roll my weed
Let your hair down
That's fine by me
But don't get too high
You can roll my weed
Let your hair down
That's fine by me
Just roll my weed (roll my fucking weed)
But don't get too high

Verse:
She was a late night gun fight without the fighting
The way we clashed sometimes felt like the titans
You know how you know it's real? Feel the silence
(Shh I can't)
Not a habit to call [?]
I like it how she hates how I like cars and girls and money
Haha, you know these hoes be funny
But hey, shake shake shake shake shake it
She want a rockstar with my tight leather jacket
Smoking like a rasta with my ganja and my matches
Beaches in Jamaica, all you bamboclat bitches
Wait wait wait don't break it
Oh she want it faster but he's upset
Play the track back for you, rewind
You can roll up in the meantime

Hook:
You don't have to think about too much
What are you waiting for?
We can get high
You can roll my weed
Let your hair down
That's fine by me
Don't get too high
You can roll my weed
Let your hair down
That's fine by me
Just roll my weed
Don't get too high

Bridge:
Sometimes I get high just to balance out the lows
House party in the room and everybody knows
Excuse me Bobby Brown but where's the [?]
You can smell the smoke in my clothes
All by myself in my room burning loud
My momma say, "Vic, please turn that shit down"
I can't, I can't, I'm sorry momma, I can't

Hook:
You know, you don't have to worry about too much
What are you waiting for?
We can get high
You can roll my weed
That's fine by me
You can roll my weed
That's fine by me
