Married to the king, married to the mob

[Verse 1]
Who gives a fuck about what anybody say about me
Man y'all ain't raise me, word to Betsy McGurk-Mensah
She the only one, the only one I can't let down
Mama, she the reason, she the reason I ain't quit yet
I wake up at 9 o'clock this morning, 3 o'clock for tequila shots
So sick, blame it on the alcohol, Jamie Foxx
Ready to let it all go
I only wonder, will my niggas see tomorrow?
Cause we been livin' like the past can't catch up
And we been livin' like them niggas can't catch up
And we been runnin' in the streets like it's recess
I'm so aggressive, man I keep 'em on the defense
Hey, hey, hey I think I'm gone off the deep end
I'm tryna keep this shit together, keep this shit together
I call this "Married To The King" and the beat Coretta
How it feel? How it feel? I should be feelin' better
That's fucked up, man I guess that's what life is
Best dressed, suicide, Louis neck to the knife
Down to hit a stain like a 197
With my dogs, I hope all dogs go to Heaven
If the lady is a tramp, let her suck the noodle
And I came for the check, came for the check
And my nigga got the tote the toaster like a strudel
Shout to Denzel Curry, we don't take kindly to threats
Niggas don't need to see me go cuckoo
Ten seconds from a mental breakdown, I'm out of state now
Old Country Buffet, I got so much on my plate now
I just left L.A., I'm flyin' right back to L.A. now

[Hook]
I'm married to the beat, she married to the king
'Til death do us part, death do us part
And I'm married to the beat, she married to the king
'Til death do us part, man, she my baby

[Verse 2]
Toast to the boy goin' crazy
I told my new bitch I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I got rabies
I'm stayin' out the pound, they can't cage me
I gotta be the man I am, it ain't no point in tryna change me
And you love me for it
Point me to whoever got the throne, man I'm comin' for it
I love it when they underestimate us
I can't lie, man that shit just make me want it more, want it more
All of my shit is a 1 of 1
Ain't no second place, nigga, I'm a self-made nigga
Man I'm castaway, I had to get it on my own
I was S.O.S., ain't no help came, nigga
No bullshit, nigga, only true shit
Put me on a deposition, I can prove it
I can never tell, I can never tell
If it wasn't for the bank, I could never tell
YSL and Lanvin like a French nigga
I got shows in Montana like a French nigga
I been workin' late nights like I rode by it
I ain't Will Smith but it feels like I just got hitched, nigga

[Hook]
Married to the beat, she married to the king
'Til death do us part, death do us part
And I'm married to the beat, she married to the king
'Til death do us part, man, that's my baby
Married to the beat, she married to the king
'Til death do us part, death do us part
Married to the bank, married to the king
'Til death do us part, nigga
