[Intro: Children]
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever

[Chorus: Children & Towkio]
We won't do what they tell us
Pill poppin' just to feel better
Times gettin' hard; we try keep our head up
If we die, we gon' live forever
We go where they won't let us
We won't do what they tell us
Pill poppin' just to feel better
If we die, we gon' live forever

[Verse 1: Towkio]
I said the kids gonna do what they wanna do
When it gets hot out, I hope they make it through summer school
'Cause it get cold-blooded when no 5-0 comin'
And when they come around, don't nobody know nothin'
It don't feel safe, cold case, love lost
When the shorties got guns, call it the 'City of God'
And they ain't taught how to aim, watch they friend get killed
Right there in front of your face, so how the fuck would you feel? And so I pop pain pills until I feel better and I'm hustlin' now we got that phone bill
And I got me a job but no it won't cut it, so I step on that work 'cause the dope will
All we know is Now and Laters and skyscrapers
Yeah it's concrete, where the kids at? Let me go speak to 'em
But if you've never seen any mountains or the stars
How you ever 'sposed to know that's the thing you should reach for?

[Pre-Chorus: Children]
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever

[Chorus: Children & Towkio]
We won't do what they tell us
Pill poppin' just to feel better
Times gettin' hard, we try keep our head up
If we die, we gon' live forever
We won't do what they tell us
Pill poppin' just to feel better
Times gettin' hard, we try keep our head up
If we die, we gon' live forever

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
We never die that's why my motto still alive
Like Aaliyah's spirit I told you one and a million times
This is a dream, the one I used to fantasize
So I'm lookin' at me from Heaven, through my grandma's eyes
And I know that she be proud, so you hear me screamin' loud
"I'm on a billboard just so you could see me now!"
If she's in the clouds, why pour my drink on the ground?
So I pour it up for you, you want Henn' or a crown?
Chi-Town ambulances don't come around
When shorties' brains blown out, you want me to dumb it down?
That's why we get high roll trees and backwoods
It's hard to know you can when you raised off canned goods
All we know is U.S.D.A checks and Save-A-Lot
Never had money so we had to save alot
But how you gonna tell the kids they capable to rewrite pop culture when all they had was pills to pop?

[Outro: Children]
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
I wish I could live forever
