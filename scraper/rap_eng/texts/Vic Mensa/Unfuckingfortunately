[Chorus: Keyon Christ]
Unfuckingfortunately
Unfuckingfortunately
Unfuckingfortunately, you're a waste of time
Unfuckingfortunately, yeah
Unfuckingfortunately, yeah
Unfuckingfortunately, you're a waste of time, yeah

[Post-Chorus: Keyon Christ]
I feel where you comin' from, but I can't spend another one
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
I feel where you comin' from, but I can't spend another one

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Adi贸s, adi贸s, adi贸s, adi贸s (Vino)
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
I can't fuck wit' you no more, no more, no more, no more
I heard you fallin' off like dominoes
If modeling don't work out, there's always Domino's (Haha, yeah)
Blame yourself, woo, don't blame me girl
Just put on that Freshman 15, but you twenty-three girl, damn
You can't be young forever, you ain't Peter Pan
Maybe we can get back together in Never Never Land
I tried to mold ya, you tried my composure
Had to put your ass out the house, like Omarosa
Now you can't even sleep on the couch, or sleep on the sofa
I just wanna know thing, now, was this always what you wanted?

[Chorus: Keyon Christ]
Unfuckingfortunately (Unfuckingfortunately)
Unfuckingfortunately (Unfuckingfortunately)
Unfuckingfortunately, you're a waste of time, uh (Unfuckingfortunately)
Unfuckingfortunately, yeah
Unfuckingfortunately, yeah
Unfuckingfortunately, you're a waste of time, yeah (Unfuckingfortunately)

[Post-Chorus: Keyon Christ]
I feel where you comin' from, but I can't spend another one
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no (Nah, nah)
I feel where you comin' from, but I can't spend another one

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Fuck another game, I don't wanna play now
I can't see your face, money in the way now
I came up, you on the way down, and you coulda' stayed down, but, it's too late now
Girl, you know it pours when it rains now
Oh, of course, you feel a way now
Save your tears for the train now
I don't have the time...

[Chorus: Keyon Christ]
Unfuckingfortunately
Unfuckingfortunately
Unfuckingfortunately, you're a waste of time
Unfuckingfortunately, yeah
Unfuckingfortunately, yeah
Unfuckingfortunately, you're a waste of time, yeah
