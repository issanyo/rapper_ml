[Hook]
When I get down on my luck I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood
They say ain't what you know but who you know
You need to know someone to know no one
When I get down on my luck
I roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome
Lost some years, I used to know
I know my fate like bullets in a shotgun

[Hook]
When I get down on my luck I hide behind my eyes in Hollywood
They say ain't what you know but who you know
You need to know someone to know no one
When I get down on my luck
I roll one up and roll around all by my lonesome
Lost some years, I used to know
I know my fate like bullets in a shotgun

[Verse 1]
She loves to dream, living in and off and out her mind
In space and time, she takes a line & lies her life
Away you might just say she stays to go nowhere
Midnight scenes from an old romantic movie
Usually you'd be there today I say was different
I can take you with me wondering, if you wanna go there
Down on my luck
Down on my luck

[Bridge]
Do you think about the things you say you don't?
I know you do, white wine she over cool
Ooh look at you, look at you
Do you think the things you do or who you know?
Cause they told you to, why you listen to 'em?
Hands up, middle finger to 'em
Fuck that, get down

When I get down on my luck, when I get down on my luck
When I get down on my luck, when I get down on my luck
Down on my luck, down on my luck
