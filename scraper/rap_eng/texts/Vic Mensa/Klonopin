[Intro]
Hooligans

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Cooling on the air with the squad in here
Fresco got the judge we ain't squabblin’
On that bullshit like Dennis Rodman
Bussin' off a Adderall I need me a Klonopin
SaveMoney shit bitch, we the hooligans
You know how we rock, it's the Roc in here
Drunk and belligerent we wildin’
I don't wanna feel shit I need me a Klonopin

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
We the hooligans we orchestrate the violence
KAMI put molly in my Cîroc again (Fuck!)
Hit 'em with a bat, man, I'm robbin' em
Now we talkin' to the court like Johnnie Cochran (Snitches!)
Shawty just a thot she a hypothesis
Lemme put it on her lips like collagen
Never been to college giving lectures at Harvard
She magna cum laude, I made her cum louder, AH!
Never been average, been anti-establishment
I don't even wear them shits
I'll fuck them Nikes ’cause of Kaepernick
No cap, got the team on my back like I’m in a throwback (Cap)
Put numbers on the board like stats
Fresco gon' shoot I ain’t talkin' 'bout crack (boom! boom! boom!)

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Cooling on the ave with the squad in here
Fresco got the judge we ain't squabblin’
On that bullshit like Dennis Rodman
Bussin' off a Adderall I need me a Klonopin
SaveMoney shit bitch, we the hooligans
You know how we rock, it's the Roc in here
Drunk and belligerent we wildin'
I don't wanna feel shit I need me a Klonopin

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
27 club, hall of fame, a self medicator
Rollin swisha paper, like Onyx I got sticky fingers
Tom petty heartbreaker, freefallin' off the cradle
Tell the label cut the check, that's rock, scissors, paper (Woo!)
Money is good for my health (Uh) I knew the drugs wouldn't help
Often times I think of hanging myself, like Alex McQueen, give me the belt (Uh)
I got a reason to live (Yuh)
Already been through hell (Uh)
But I got a 'script for the meds (Why?)
'Cause I got pain to kill

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Cooling on the ave with the squad in here
Fresco got the judge we ain't squabblin'
On that bullshit like Dennis Rodman
Bussin' off a Adderall I need me a Klonopin
SaveMoney shit bitch, we the hooligans
You know how we rock, it's the Roc in here
Drunk and belligerent we wildin'
I don't wanna feel shit I need me a Klonopin

[Outro: Korporate]
I know at some point
Everybody that had a little demo they ain't do no justice
Cappin', that moment when you realise you lost one?
That shit hurt I ain't gon' lie to ya
Players fuck up though
