[Hook: Via Rosa]
She said she sick of the cocaine
It's a hell of a drug
She said she sick of the cocaine
It's a hell of a drug

[Verse 1: Via Rosa]
Oh you said it was only one time
And you didn't even like it
That you'd never get caught doing it alone at night when
When you were lonely, you were lonely
No you wouldn't resort to cocaine

[Verse 2: TheMIND]
I'm sick of it all, my mama used the raw so
Of course I have to snort it mental distorted
From all the lines given unto me
Here sipping 7up, chopping up Britney
Praying to the heavenly father I don't end up like Whitney
My palms are itchy, my senses iffy, the present trippy
The past might trip me if I let it, my sissy text me she miss me
I miss her too, I'm addicted what should I do
I'm a dickhead if I don't move, I've been tripping, dropped out of school
Selling myself these white lines
Guess I'm a dope dealer trying to sell you on me
My papa warned me, that my manipulative ways would backfire this morning
You looked back at me for the first time
As I emptied that last vial and handed you that hundred dollar bill
And the thought that this was ludicrous now fact I'm a liar
And I'm not worth a shit but still
That mirror show you too, and even if you only use to
Take the edge off, I bet y'all
Any amount of money she'd be running back faster then the hedgehog
I'm using, sonically of course
Cause socially I'm bored
And spiritually I'm torn
And my morals are all gone
So this Cocaine

[Hook: Via Rosa]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
Wait, I think I can hear your footsteps
Not that that mean I'm lonely
But better than that more likely
Just wish you would be there for me
I wish that when you close your eyes you could fall asleep
Instead of falling into acting like the company you keep
Close my neck, hold my hand and watch me dive slow
Down a bottle of gin, head first to the sin one hand on the bible
Boy I just sold back from the Devil for a line of yay
Resort to it at night because you were scared to give it the time of day
And then that night falls, that's when that coke calls
And then you drink too much, you start to doze off
You bend back into it like a pole vault, wipe your nose off
No powder on the table but you can hear the coke talk
She say she just wanna do it like Hollywood does it
So she stretch her restaurant paycheck to fit it in her budget
And she say she love it, probably much as she love herself
So you know who she call when she need to ask someone for help

[Outro: Via Rosa]
There's always a reason
Always an excuse
Always a line that you gotta do
My love won't be hanging on much longer
