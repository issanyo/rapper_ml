[Intro]
Who's the five best rappers of all time?
Think about it
Dylan, Dylan, Dylan, Dylan and Dylan
Because I spit hot fire

[Chorus]
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gonna bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing, with their life
When a fire starts to burn, right, and it starts to spread
She gonna bring that attitude home
Don't wanna do nothing, with their life

[Verse 1]
Uh, Vic shotta, cool damn, me shit hotter
Don dada, me dog like Ruff Ryder
Where you from, in the jungle with piranhas?
Some mink corner cut her and a super lover, uh
Cut your whole teeth like Kesha
Paper boy, extra extra, read all about it
Plus the Mac 10 on the dresser
Plus I'm Sam L. I'm coming to get ya, uh
Shorty too hot, don't touch her
Break ya neck, you's a busta
Friday night, Chris Tucker
Melt ice cube, now I gotta wet ya
We live in police state, police'll arrest ya
Me jam with the DJ, he keep the pressure
We live in police state, police'll arrest ya
First they gotta catch ya
And I run the 312
I got banks though like Azealia, carry a sick shot
Like, like malaria, laughing to the bank, hilarious
And I'm on the road with you-know-who
In Miami Beach with the 2 Live Crew
On Disclosure beats, it's a duo crew, uh
Collect dough in various areas
All around the world, all around the world, uh
Where you been? All around the world, uh
Got a couple numb's on a lot o' girl, uh
Where she from? She ain't even say
Probably on a island, probably something exotic
Life a definition of the body
On a expedition on any boat
I'm out in T-Dot, catch me in traffic
Fifteen hoes in van, that's average
Take 'em to the Hoxton, she think she lavish
Bitch, you ain't got no passes
To Isabel Marant, shit don't get you access
Uh, me and Kaytranada out in Montreal, in Monte Carlo
Wherever I go I'm entourage like Ari Gold, I'm sorry, ho
I don't want your cardio
Deals on the table like Black jack, uh
I ain't 21, got a show in Vegas, uh
Hit the lights ho, yeah clap that, uh
Put your back straight, standing ovation, uh
And I'm on tour all the way in Europe
Wonder if you're allowed to sip syrup on probation
Got shit on my suitcase, I should buy a suit cause
Uh, I be catching cases
Me and Rockie Fresh rocking Bape shit, uh
And I'm in the booth on a late shift, uh
And I'm in the air with a new pair, uh
Looking stupid fly up in O'Hare
Balling, but pimpin is just a hobby
Needless to say though, I be going Scotty
2014, I'm shitting on everybody, uh
Bitch, I'm about to shit on everybody, uh
"Down On My Luck", that's coming soon, uh
"Feel That", nigga, that's coming soon, uh
Leather Cords, shit, that’s coming soon
Wave Theory, nigga, that’s coming soon, uh
Tell 'em it's the SAVEMONEY summer, June
Fuckboys, they don't know what to do
Hold on, let me, let me get it from the top

Firestarter, firestarter, I'm a firestarter, get hot! [4x]
