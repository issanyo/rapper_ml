[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
No matter where you go, you'll never have control
No one makes it out alive, no one makes it out alive in paradise

[Verse 1: Jesse Rutherford]
Picture you in summertime, drinkin' white wine in Antigua
Told me that you'll see me and I see ya
And I really wanna believe ya, I do
Singin' blues, no shoes on
Strummin' in the sun and you've got your feet up
I remember when you used to tell me that you'd find your freedom
It was hard to believe ya

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jesse Rutherford]
'Cause you never feel enough, it never fills you up
And if lyin' on an island is the closest that you'll come
Then run, go ahead, have fun, run

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
No matter where you go (Doesn't matter where you go)
You'll never have control (No, no, no, no)
Woke up feeling paralyzed (Yeah)
No one makes it out alive (Yeah)
In paradise (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Jesse Rutherford]
Picture me in the major leagues
Livin' in a dream that I created, mhm
I wrote my own books so I never had to read your pages
I've got no patience for that anyway
Sensations don't mean anything
If I can just have everything
Some days I think I'll run away
What would I even do if I made it?
I just keep on fading 'cause

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jesse Rutherford]
I never feel enough, it never fills me up
I'm climbin' up a giant rock, I'll never reach the top
But I can't stop, I can't stop, so

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
No matter where I go (Doesn't matter where I go, no, no)
I'll never have control (Never ever had it anyway)
Woke up feeling paralyzed (Yeah)
No one makes it out alive (Yeah) in paradise (Yeah)
Paralyzed (Yeah)
No one makes it out alive (Yeah) in paradise (Yeah)

[Outro: Vic Mensa]
With your band of brothers, band- band of brothers
And when we pull up in the Phantom, the fans gon' love it
With your band of brothers, band- band- band
With- with your band- band of brothers
And when we pull up in the Phantom, the fans gon' love it
