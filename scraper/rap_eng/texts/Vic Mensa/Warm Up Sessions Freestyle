[Intro]
You niggas ain't drinking enough water man, that's why y'all skin look crazy man
Stay hydrated man, SBTV

[Verse]
Conversations with pops how it ain't take that long to get here
And where I want to take it for the future
I told him I'm renovatin' a roof in a castle of many kings
But only one in a million Martin Luthers, you think non-violent
Like I ain't come from the same city that Keef did
And never held them bars inside the precinct
Step out a hospital to check on Jake just to see if he was decent
Have me thinkin' 'bout, when I was in that room myself
Exposed a lot of people's true feelings whether they lend a hand to help
Or only in it for the ride, I guess I'll let you decide
My mind movin' a million miles per minute
I should cop a whip and get in it
In the last leg of the rap race, runnin' point in the game with thieves
Tradin' bullets is better to give than it is to receive
They said I couldn't be, make 'em choke on the breath they breathe
Why I stay me, for the ones that didn't believe me
You see the contradiction, my life a mess, I dirty my dishes
Mom still wash my clothes, used to carry bags out the kitchen
Seventeen years old, sellin' O's my pops was trippin'
Look at my life as a product of real nigga's decisions
That's the truth, I always knew I know
Even when we ain't have much to hold now we get ten a show
Tell Trip, tell them boys I want more, I multiply my bands
I was hangin' outside the store I had them holes inside my pants
Some of my niggas still sell dope, hope they don't catch a case
Judge wanna see a young nigga get locked up
I just wanna cuff bitches in a hot tub
Live fast, die young, like a rock star
Eddie Van Halen, hate to say pick up we made the call
But I still put 'em on my neck, cover this Goldilocks and gold
Off the plane I put the city on, tell 'em that I'm really home
If I die before I wake, hope I write it in a song
Hope I die a million strong, hope I bring a billi home
Hope I crash leavin' the club bringin' the Bentley home
SaveMoney attitude, yeah that's the shit we on
I just sat down with Jay Z, what he really on
I've never been the type to ask for somebody to put me on
But I just feel like when it's right, man it can't be wrong
Spent a lot of time in my mind, done, minutes gone
When I look back it's them same times that made me strong
I feel like D Rose when he played for Simeon
Bitch I feel like Steve Nash when he get his pivot on
The way I turn around and spit on every track I'm singin' on
I feel like the ceiling's gone, really on
Something like that, shoutout to SBTV man, I'm out here man
London boy
