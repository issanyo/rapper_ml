[Verse]
South side to the south of France
I just got off a flight from Cannes
A couple weeks before I was on a plane to Japan
I'm rockin' Louis but I'm Gucci, shout to Dapper Dan
Just bought a crib in the white hood, I ain't talkin' 'bout the klan
Fuck a hit single, I'm a million dollar man
They wipe away with the waves like castles made of sand
I'm jus' sayin', I laid my foundation, made the blueprint
A lot of niggas made moves, Vic made a movement
Fertilized my green, I mean I came from the bullshit
Triple beam in the wall, I was tryin' to make home improvements
But if niggas want to get ratchet, I'm Tim the tool man
Give you a lead belly like a lick from a blues man
My hittas pull up on the crime scene like a news van
Hit your body, have you doing burpees like you in bootcamp
Tryin' to stay nonviolent, I'm still St. Laurent stylin'
And we slangin' hydroponic, that shit that Dre called 'chronic'
Doper than a eight ball and he got soul like he The Delfonics
E'ything paid fo', all my girls trip like Tiffany Haddish
Put my sister in a mansion, put my momma on a island, yeah
School of hard knocks, we was magna cum laude
I came off of old 4-7, yeah, Hyde Park on my back, yeah
Your money 4 foot 7, yeah, my shit tall like Shaq, yeah
My clique ball like Steph and 'em, I got hoes like Hef and 'em
I be euro steppin', ballin' in Paris like ain't no reffin' him
Crossin' the border like Mexicans and he still got that pack on him
Straight out the 'Raq like Keef and 'em, better yet, like Phil Jackson and 'em
And I don't even practice, tatted all up on me like Iverson
In LA like I'm a Dodgers fan, might let this off like a moccasin, yeah
She want Pappadeaux, uh, I took her to Papa John's
We just left out Hakkasan with 8 hoes, that's a octogon
I still got shottas that'll let them choppers blow like operas, yeah
Symphony, orchestra, timpani drum when
The 223 slaughter ya, you gon' need a carpenter
A coroner to talk to ya and go build you a coffin up
And my girl like Meghan Markle, you can't talk to her
I'm a king so salute me like a royal officer
My shooters ain't got no hobby, uh, pull up on you in the lobby, uh
And they ain't gon' shoot the W sign boy they gon' shoot yo body, uh
Niggas be thinkin' they He-Man, make 'em do the BlocBoy JP dance, yeah
Off-White 3 bands, call Virgil, now that's free bands
Bitch I'm so next season, I got Giuseppe makin' me custom Zanotti sneakers
Uh, yeah
On 'em only bleedin', my flow Kotex bleedin'
Bitch I'm God in the flesh, I feel like Hotep breathin'
I Bowflex, biceps, both pecs, triceps
Tote techs, my whole set bounty hunters, Boba Fett
Bitch I'm a dog, Doberman, my red rag, republican
That boy bad, Puff and 'em, that boy swag, that boy past
That boy the shit, excrement
