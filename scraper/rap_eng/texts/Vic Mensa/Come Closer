[Verse 1: Donnie Trumpet]
Well, like-like-like
I stammer
You used to be my wife-wife-wife
But somewhere in the middle I got caught up in rehearsals
In between the sheets, a riddle
But I kid you not these days
Because all I know is Kids These Days
And it covers nights where you wish I could pull covers over you
And I wish "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" would really come true
So I could be with a girl like you, and you, and you
And still make love to music
Because muses call me to her cradling neck
And arms like a crib
And we make love just like a baby
Passion and pain don't compare to you fashion and flame
You are my fire, my water, even when you complain
Or bite your lips and breath heavy
Love sits in your chest, heaving, heavy, heaven
You are the open gates of beauty and serenity
And spoken, floating on ecstasy
The places where we dwell
For all's well that ends well
Though both our loves might swell
And burst
It'll always be worth every moment, starting with the first
My slice of pie
The apple of my one-eyed caterpillar
We shake pillars when we dance
Hands grasping, folding our every glance
Holding on strong to every second
All we need is the art we make
We are artisans, working at a craft
We are soldiers, fighting for our dreams
We are honorable, worthy of heavy metals
Hanging around our cradling necks
Cradling our hearts, arms like cribs
We'll rock each other to sleep every night
Being the rock star that you are
Of all the galaxies, you are
The one we focus
Shows our dopeness
Shows our closeness
Come closer

[Bridge: Donnie Trumpet / Vic Mensa]
I miss you / Come closer
I wish you'd / Come over

[Hook: Vic Mensa] x4
Baby come closer
I miss you, come closer, I wish you'd come over

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Life (life) is a gamble
Sometimes it's kinda hard to handle
So baby, hit the lights
If you want to, but if we really tryna hear about what you won't do
You need to let it be (be)
Take it easy
Just open up your mind girl, believe me
Just take a look in you will see
The world where everyone could be free
Let my mind take the backstreets
Traveling through in a busted train
Reach deep into my soul and you could touch the pain
My city sleeps underneath traps and trees
But it's laying on the floor like a crack in the street
Questions, interrogations, police investigations
Kicking in my door
Looking for my dope
Hooked up to my ho
You a superstar huh?
That's your occupation
Ain't been the same for me since the operation
Open heart surgery
From a woman under qualified
Talking to myself, I told a lot of lies
You my golden Cali
You're the one I idolize, queen
Could this be a dream?
Come a little closer
Let me show you what I mean
Now you look at me
We should be a team
We should be a team
Turn a "me" into an "us"
Word
All it take a little trust
Baby, it's a must
Let it be, open up your eyes
Let yourself see

[Outro: Donnie Trumpet and Vic Mensa]
Let yourself see
I said, I said (what)
Let yourself see
You should be with me
That's the truth though

[Hook: Vic Mensa] (x4)
