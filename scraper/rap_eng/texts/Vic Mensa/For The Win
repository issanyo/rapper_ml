[Intro]
Uh
Yes
Vic!
Check, Look, Uh

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Uh-um, today was a good day
When I say you bad, girl I mean that in a good way
The winner is: yours truly
I will be ready when they give the awards to me
Congratulations
Tell em that I'm on till the next one
Till I get a buzz like my phone when a text come
All my niggas in it, the music only reflects them
And so I am doing deals until I get a couple to select from
Yeah, this is on behalf of my team
And the [?] I got in my duffle bag from supreme
And baby tell me that I don't be speaking and so it seem like I be thinking that I don't even know [?]
I'm in my own world, '94 Common shit
Don't compare me to niggas I have nothing in common with
I am the two three
The one [?]
Homecoming, drinking tequila, no mocking bird

[Hook]
Ima do it right (yeah), on my spring break shit
Shout out to the girls I'm kicking it at the lake with
Red cup sipping, burning L's by the pool house
Even when it's back in, I'm feeling like school's out
And Ima do my own thing, so may the best man win
Nigga, may the best man win
Man, I fell the fuck out then I woke up gone
And now I'm working til tonight when Ima do it again
Lets get it

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Somebody tell 'em Hyde Park is the home base
I'm swinging for the stands, bout to run this shit
Blowing up, they say I'm the bomb on some hundreds shit
Throwing up the brainiac as if I couldn't stomach it
Give your girl a heat stroke, hotter than the summer get it
I don't have to make 'em go, I got that shit they come and get
A Chicago McDonald's, I'm posted up in the front of it
Save Money nigga, get a Chase card
Double O, I'm riding on the track like a race car
See the way I'm putting words together like I ain't got a space bar
A Chicagorilla from the jungle where the apes are
Boy, I said I'm coming out swingning, put your guards up
Time for these candy ass rappers to get they bars up
Gotem rocking with it, my nigga, turn the guitars up
Shooting for the moon, a nigga wetting the stars up
Shots fired, nah I'm in it till the end
Ima see 'em at the finish line, I'm going for the win (for the win)

[Hook]
Ima do it right (yeah), on my spring break shit
Shout out to the girls I'm kicking it at the lake with
Red cup sipping, burning L's by the pool house
Even when it's back in, I'm feeling like school's out
And Ima do my own thing, so may the best man win
Nigga, may the best man win
Man, I fell the fuck out then I woke up gone
And now I'm working til tonight when Ima do it again
Lets get it

[Outro: Group of Girls]
Fuck bitches, save money (x8)
Nigga
Fuck bitches save money
And if you don't know now you know nigga!
Ah! This is so fucking fun!

[Outro: Vic Mensa]
When I'm getting bread, put the hollow head to they head
Getting bread up in the Chi

We getting bread up in the Chi, what?
We getting bread up in the Chi (getting bread up in the Chi)
Bread up in the Chi
We getting bread up in the Chi (x2)
Getting bread where?
Getting bread up in the Chi
