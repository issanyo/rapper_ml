[Chorus 1: BIG Notorious]
Damn Ma I love you like the[?]
Ganja, Get Familiar
Can I feel ya ?
All I want to do is touch ya
The ultimate rush
The drugs baby

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Smoking something, bitch a nigga
Kushy like a rasta
Chiefing with my polo hat
Leaning like my posture
The best of the blunt rollers
I deserve a Oscar
I'm on some god father shit
Smoking the [?]
Like Hasta la vista
Sweets like Easter
See me dumping guts up out the window like vista
Vic could get it hot
But I'm cold like Keisha
Getting blunted by the school
Nigga motherfuck a teacher
Got that loud pack poppin'
Big pack coppin'
The pound boy
Big Homie got the [?] for a sound boy
I told you my niggas are dogs
Im in a smoke cloud
Standing in the thick of the fog
You know I get it jumping like kicking a frog
