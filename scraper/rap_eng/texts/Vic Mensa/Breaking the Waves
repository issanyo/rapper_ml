[Verse 1]
Over and over love
We keep picking up the pieces
Don't know who's chasing you, love
Why you trying to

[Chorus]
Keep breaking the waves, baby
They'll be pulling you down again
Every night I'm wishing you
Getting washed up on the shoreline
You're only breaking yourself
Every night I'm wishing you
Aye-oh aye-oo aye oh
Know you'll never be
Aye-oh aye-oo aye oh
Forever I'll be wishing you
Aye-oh aye-oo aye oh
I know you'll never be
Never be
Never be mine

[Verse 2]
Remember there was a time
When I thought you were unbreakable
When I fell in love with you
I saw you run into the ocean

[Chorus]
Keep breaking the waves baby
They'll be pulling you down again
Every night I'm wishing you
Getting washed up on the shoreline
You're only breaking yourself
Every night I'm wishing you
Aye-oh aye-oo aye oh
Know you'll never be
Aye-oh aye-oo aye oh
Forever I'll be wishing you
Aye-oh aye-oo aye oh
Oh I know you'll never be mine
Never be mine (never be, never be mine)
Oh you'll never be
Oh you'll never be
