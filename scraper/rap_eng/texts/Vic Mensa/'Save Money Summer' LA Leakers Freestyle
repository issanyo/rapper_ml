[Intro]
Yeah, Save Money
Only the real, back with a...
Back with a....
Yeah

[Verse]
Back with a vengeance, motherfuck friendships
Uh, did you miss that part
Register to vote, for the EP download
Now ain't that smart?
You niggas ain't that smart
Can't play that card, can't handle the kid
Bang 'em up and leave 'em blue
Like my nigga ScHoolboy, that boy straight out of Fig
City of Hoover, uh, shout out to Junior
Uh, balling like Michael, only disciples
We ever knew was, Gangsta Disciples
Black and blue but I was black and red
Blake Griffin, how I'm rising on 'em
Get your L.A Clippers cause I'm at your head
Sleeping on me, just go back to bed
Okay, okay, okay
Okay, okay, okay
Son you in your city
When I drop the show dates
Uh, pull up on me, I call Emory
I got shooters everywhere for my enemies
I had to fire my management, I wanna be with my real friends
I ain't feeling your energy
Why these niggas so fake
They so fake, so fake
Stevey personalities
They Stephen Colbert
Hey, Hamilton's is on me
I should be on Broadway
Beef I turn it into Burger King
Just have it your way, phone ring
I might have to call Miss Info up
Let her get a little bit of info
'Bout some niggas that I used to be cool with
Ehhh, let me bend back like Limbo
You don't wanna hang like that, like a lynch rope
You can get sliced up, RIP to Kimbo
I go Birdman when I see you dog
With your baby or your baby momma, I get all three of 'yall
Respek on my name
Please put some fuckin' respek on my name
I put respek on my vote
Switching the system, I'm changing the game
This is the Roc, stay in your lane
I'm taking shots, I ain't saying no names
I'm from the Chi, on my block it's a Cole World
Like I'm with the Fayetteville gang
I'm heating up now at this part
Yeah, Power 106, Lift Off
Vic ain't hot, man you must be smoking that Whitney
Tell 'em Bobby Brown kick rocks
Shout my nigga Rocky and my boss Rick Ross
I admit, I admit, Bill Cosby
No weapon formed against me will prosper
Niggas been phonies and they really still frauds, I ain't fucking with 'em
