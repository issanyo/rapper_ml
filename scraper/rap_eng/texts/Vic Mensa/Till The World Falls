[Intro: Cosha]
You are now listening to Chic

[Chorus: Cosha]
We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down
Hey!

[Verse 1: Cosha]
The world has gone mad
We might be safer on the dancefloor
So much destruction in our path
Wake up, wake up
They're comin' back for more, they comin' back for more

[Pre-Chorus: Cosha]
It's still real so let's just rock the floor
(And live now like tomorrow never comes)
Loose ourselves tonight, with no remorse
Until forever

[Chorus: Cosha]
We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

[Verse 2: Cosha]
Now that the coast is clear, we have no fear
We're the survivors
Wake up because the day is finally here
A new horizon

[Pre-Chorus: Cosha]
It's still real so let's just rock the floor
(And live now like tomorrow never comes)
Loose ourselves tonight, with no remorse
Oh baby

[Chorus: Cosha]
We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
Let's step out tonight
My feet don't walk, they fly, I dance on clouds tonight
Yeah, with me, a natural high
And it's my birthday
Imma just rock my birthday suit
I take the shirt and the shoes off, the vintage too
Call that my birthday cool
And I wanna be free, wanna feel good to be me
Me, look bitch, I'm a king
I got a dream
I might just call up my team and go skydiving off of my wing
I feel flyer than Maya, I know why the caged bird sings
'Cause you gotta have a song when the world falls down
You don't wanna be alone so we just keep dancing

[Chorus: Cosha]
We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down

[Bridge: Cosha]
We can go on and on and on
Until the world falls down
We can go on and on and on
Until the world falls down

[Chorus: Cosha]
We keep dancing till' the world falls
Go on and on till' the world falls down
And we can make the world fall down
