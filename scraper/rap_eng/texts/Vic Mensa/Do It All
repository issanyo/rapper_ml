[Intro: James Fauntleroy]
Been on top for a while
I’m ready to go now, my niggas

[Verse 1 :Price]
I remember kickbacks and kick flips
Always getting into mischief
Mama had the red Intrepid with the stick shift
I take it out on missions and crash it and would get grounded like a dipshit
And be at school like "ain’t nobody fresher than my clique", shit
You never thought you’d have a son like this
The type of son that run with them niggas that hold up them guns like this
He gots a hunger for God and wants to resemble his son like this
He’s confused so he takes it out on the drums like this
Drop 'em. Uh
Pretty much I wanna be great
Dom P in my glass, I want Yellowtail on my plate, uh
I wanna be first place in the Grammy race
With a college grad, yellow bone with all my granny traits
And I want all my albums platinum, I want none on the shelf
And I wanna be a great dad ‘cause I ain’t have one for myself, my nigga
So before nothing’s left I’ll do right
Never thought I’d have this chance in my life
I bet y'all I’ll do it all tonight
Price! Free Ninja!

[Hook]
All y'all, we been working hard
Gotta [?]
'fore I lose my nigga
Been on top for a while
I’m ready to go now, my niggas

[Verse 2 : Oktane]
I always wanted to make the people clap – like that
Like Wayne retired and this the song he played when he came back
I just wanna live out the thoughts I'd have when I’d sit in the shower
Letting the water hit me wishing heaven had visiting hours
I miss Cornbread, I miss Rowdy
I wish they could see me now
They’d probably tell me that they were proud and I would say show me who doubted
And right when they point at you
I wanna cock back, point and shoot
But I wouldn’t do that cuz that would turn off my lime light
And I’m just tryna live life like I could die tomorrow
Like the sky is falling, life is diabolic
People die for dollars on the side of markets
And police take forever to arrive and park it
And by the time they find the guy who popped him witness won’t talk to a cop or a fire marshall
What am I supposed to do besides get it up in this rap shit?
Without y'all talkin that jerk shit or that trap shit
Do you feel like a dumb ass yet?
Well that’s classic cause I told y'all
We was tight and proved us right in one verse
Yea, I celebrate tonight

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
Magic in the musical moments, songs in the key of life
Feelin like Stevie, wonder what he see, think I need a light
Pardon me kindly, copycat kiddos can’t sneak or bite
Bet I make 'em eat they words
Wavy, light skinned Jesus Christ
Me and Price connected to making classic
Was classicly frequently absent back in my classes
Back when I used to keep a quarter inside my backpack
Back in Whitney Young High School
Me and the team was like the Ratt Pack
I’m Young Sinatra, rock the gold chain like Cleopatra
Watching from the balcony, black binoculars at the opera
Peepin this shit from the side I’m seeing a different angle
You see money behind closed doors and that shit can change you
Ray Ray had the Range Rove, used to pick us up like every weekend
We be tweaking, turning 20, now I’m seeking deeper meaning
What’s the word? I heard the hoods the same but shit been different
The band broke up, Zoe’s preppin and Eddy’s still in prison
Screamin free my nigga Ugly E until my lung go lonely on this island
I’ve been poppin bottles to bottom my pain
I hope this shit doesn’t show
Say Southern Cali don’t rain but when it drizzles it pour
We 'posed to be eatin shrimp and steak on $1000 plates, these fake niggas can’t deny me nothing
Couldn’t walk a mile in these pennies, these rappers a dime a dozen
Timing is everything, she said she know I got it right
But I’m only here 'til tomorrow so I guess we gon' do it all tonight

[Hook]
