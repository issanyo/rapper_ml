[Chorus]
Boy, we all know
There's no need to chase what's mine
We're still so young
Got a little time
So, let me know it's all good
It's all good
You can do whatever you want
So i'ma do whatever i want
As long as you're my number 1, my number 1
As long as i'm your...

[Verse 1]
Chick that you call through
Never on the side
I stay playin center
Them others on the line
Waitin for the chance
I drop the ball on you
They ain't gonna get it
Better forget it
Maybe a taste but that's all, but that's all
Don't get it twisted
They see where it belongs, it belongs
Cuz...

Boy, we all know
There's no need to chase what's mine
We're still so young
Got a little time
So, let me know it's all good
It's all good
You can do whatever you want
So i'ma do whatever i want
As long as you're my number 1, my number 1
As long as i'm your...

So, i'ma do it like no one will
Hear me say it

[Chorus]
Boy, we all know
There's no need to chase what's mine
We're still so young
Got a little time
So, let me know it's all good
It's all good
You can do whatever you want
So i'ma do whatever i want
As long as you're my number 1, my number 1
As long as i'm your...
