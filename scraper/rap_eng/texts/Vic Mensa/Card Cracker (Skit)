Man 1: What up foe?
Man 2: Maintainin', god
Man 1: Damn, your ass been flexin' hard as hell, shorty. You got the Range? You ain't got no job
Man 2: Listen here, nigga, don't say shit, aight? That nigga Vic left his AmEx
Man 1: Word?
Man 2: Mothafuckas cracked his card
Man 1: Yeah, what y'all get?
Man 2: What didn't we get? PlayStation 4, AirBnBs, smart TVs, dumb TVs, ATVs, Air Force 1s, 2s, 3s, 4s and them ain't even out yet. 10 pairs of Gucci flip flops, a Gucci stroller, a Moncler for D-Block's dog. Bought a chain from his jeweler, studio time, a Young Chop beat, a Backwoods forever, Robin jeans, some jeans from a robin, bunch of birds: parrots, parakeets, gluten free Harold's, 10 gallons of mild sauce, a hundred long fashion shirts. And the crazy part is, we set it all up to make it look like that mothafucka *beep* did it
