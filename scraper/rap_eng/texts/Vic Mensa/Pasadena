[Refrain]
Honeysuckle kisses sweet and chocolate misses
You can ride my carpet let me grant your wishes
Please don't share your business, this is just between us
Sun in California, rain in Pasadena
Honeysuckle kisses sweet and chocolate misses
You can ride my carpet let me grant your wishes
Please don't share your business, this is just between us
Sun in California, rain in Pasadena

[Hook]
Rain in Pasadena
You won't fall in love again
Rain in Pasadena
Your love oh

[Verse]
They say nothing's perfect
Unless you really deserve it
Is she really worth it
Yearning for the burden but don't know for certain
Sunrise and sunset
Purple circles good for refrain
[?]
My misses I misses you
So don't you fade away

[Hook]
Rain in Pasadena
You won't fall in love again
Rain in Pasadena
Your love oh

[Refrain]
Honeysuckle kisses sweet and chocolate misses
You can ride my carpet let me grant your wishes
Please don't share your business, this is just between us
Sun in California, rain in Pasadena
Honeysuckle kisses sweet and chocolate misses
You can ride my carpet let me grant your wishes
Please don't share your business, this is just between us
Sun in California, rain in Pasadena

[Hook]
Rain in Pasadena
You won't fall in love again
Rain in Pasadena
Your love oh
