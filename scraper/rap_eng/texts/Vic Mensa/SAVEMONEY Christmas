[Intro]
Santa!
Yeah
You're bringing my present early?
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose

[Verse 1: Joey Purp]
Purp's back, have a heart attack
Money in the stroller where my daughter at
Cookies in the cabinet where the coffee at
Burners in the pillowcase in case a nigga ever call for that
And I get it jumping like they kicked it off a corner, I'm a forward this a soccer match
Bout to take my money to the laundromat
SaveMoney money gang, fuck er I'm a part of that
Fuck around and started that
Monetary obligation, papa gave me pimp stroll
Mama gave me dedication, riding with the tints low
Dealing with these bitches taught me meditation
I ain't got a problem with a nigga unless a nigga hatin'
And I ain't met Jesus if he white well then that nigga racist
Smoking on that sticky taught me concentration
Sipping on that medication
I ain't met God, but if he black then that nigga trippin'
I ain't never stop for no police me and my niggas dippin'
Martin Luther, Malcolm Purple
Bitches tell me I'm just different
Bitch I think I'm Tim Leary
Bitch I think you Robin Givens
Bitch I think I'm balling I go Scottie Pippen
I'm just trying to make sure I'm the God before I die a sinner
Quetzalcoatl called me told me get 'em so I gotta get 'em
Hotter than the heater in the summertime
I could make the summer blind
I could give the Sun a tan
DMT I'm spacing out
Wife your baby mama raise your son a man
Least the one you couldn't be
Naan nigga good as me
Purple

[Verse 2: KAMI]
Panic at the disco like them steppers stepped in
Yo plug shorted
You don copped you some that Papi off Tim
I got the drug from my Mexican friend
We eat it like lunch at the table with the popular kids
Rich and famous what they talking about
Money, money, money, money, money bank account
With insane large amounts just to brag about
Got me feeling like my first name Abraham 'til I went and brought the Benjamins out
I got a judge with a lawyer just to handle the case
I got a plug with a plug boy we never use names
I got a thought for every cell on your brain
Back to school I'ma learn me how to fly me a plane
Because life's becoming a trip
On the coast
Recline while I sip, designing a bitch
Throwing blows like there's lines in the clip
But still I'm colder than your mother
After you told her  you don't love her
Cause she ain't get you no Playstation
On Christmas

[Verse 3: Tokyo Shawn]
It's SaveMoney to the grave money fuck that other shit
Money straight from that out of state money
Tell 'em pray for me
Even with a name, couldn't get a play from me
Lately been gaining interest, call it late money
Know that wave coming, Wave Theory coming soon
Get your girl in check
Could have blown off my last shit, but they weren't ready yet
On your marks get set
See the game like an architect
If I want it then I will it to exist
But what's new
I don't give a fuck if it's Christmas
I'll throw your gift inside the fireplace
Now that's hot wraps, catch a contact
Who want' smoke
We in the game tell 'em who want' hope
The two on two to the two on four
Step on it, it's the coke motto
As famous as Coke bottles
With the J's I'll show you a role model
Heads hollow, pumpkin, they lack substance
Who you come with
Step back, you ain't even in our circumference

[Verse 4: Vic Mensa]
After the band, before the bands I never really went solo
I always kept a cup of niggas with me
Taking shots, better hit your mark
Three come for you it might get sticky
Like a drunk Santa dropping his Henny down the chimney
Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year
Knew I was the future before the present
Questioning if I should move out of the city
Ain't really much left to do here, but I'm still here
If you on a wheelchair then come pop a wheelie
Traffic, traffic looking through my taxes
Been traveling so much I got out of state rates
Overseas plates shift the parentheses, different brackets
I'm Freddy fire starter you're more like [?] the hatchet, shush
Boy you don't wanna smoke
You hide behind the mirror, scared to look a man in the eye
I know you fear me it's apparent
Like a mother of five feeding her family
Your food on the table [?] the chef [?]
In a week I fly my Bs to Jamaica on a feelin'
Do you really think I see you fuck boys or your fake feelings
You all look like dotted lines from the plane window
Might sign you if you had any talent, that's a challenge
I shattered my silence in 2013
Now it's 2014, I was 2015 when I was 15
You probably just behind me you're sloppy seconds
My minutes is money got 20K for a corporate ticket
Let the clock talk for me
Malcolm walk with me
My dogs bark for me
Canines in the unit
You a eunuch, bet your ballsack
This is a walk in the park for me
Apart from me who split ends when I was on the edge
Broke, car pooling, pulling my hair out my head
Head on crash turned my mom's whip to a pretzel
Online niggas been talking about forfeit you can google the shit I've been through
Thirty thousand went through my elbow, that's electric
Did the INNANET, everybody wanna get digital
I'm done with that, you can run with that
I'm the running back, SaveMoney back
I never left, I'm 100 like everclear on the top of Mount Everest
Standing with my fucking shirt off, I got that still alive on my chest
Scream at me!
