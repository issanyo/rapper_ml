[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
We don't believe you, we don't believe you
Bite the hand that feeds you
We don't need you, we don't need you
Bite the hand that feeds you
Fuck you, separate could never be equal
Bite the hand that feeds you
We don't believe you, you need more people
Bite the hand that feeds you

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Ooh, I can stand my ground to this shit
Tom Morello and Vic Mensa, we on time with this shit
Militant mindset, nine millimeter complex
Two middle fingers to the killers in the Congress
To live and die black, bury me in Chiraq
I cock back, pop five and lick his top hat
9/11 was a hoax, it was never hijacked
They sold our souls for oil to make us buy it back

[Refrain: Vic Mensa]
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
The poor go to war, there's no war on poverty
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
Brown versus Board never gave us equality
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
The cops seize my shit and that's not armed robbery?
Don't lie to me, you can't lie to me
Your daughter on my dick, fuck parental advisory

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
We don't believe you, we don't believe you
Bite the hand that feeds you
We don't need you, we don't need you
Bite the hand that feeds you
Fuck you, separate could never be equal
Bite the hand that feeds you
We don't believe you, you need more people
Bite the hand that feeds you

[Refrain: Vic Mensa]
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
The poor go to war, there's no war on poverty
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
Your privatized prisons supplementing your economy
Don't lie to me, don't lie to me
I'm aiming at the pig and I'm tryna hit the lottery
Don't lie to me, don't bother me
Can't, can't a cage hold this demon inside of me

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
We don't believe you, we don't believe you
Bite the hand that feeds you
We don't need you, we don't need you
Bite the hand that feeds you
Fuck you, separate could never be equal
Bite the hand that feeds you
We don't believe you, you need more people
Bite the hand that feeds you
