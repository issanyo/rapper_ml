[Verse 1]
What you know about real life?
I'll tell you what it feel like to hit rock bottom
Trynna numb the pain like a fiend on oxycontin
Addicted to the game, Kunta Kinte in these chains
Are you the loser or the victor?
Me, I live up to my name
Die anonymous, never
That’s just common sense
I got a wider lens these niggas can't see me
Like my tint was five percent
Where I live you could get merc'd if you drive a Benz
Tryna get fat but the chances of survival slim
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 2]
Blood on my Timbs
Running these streets, run in a V
It’s every man for himself
And they playing for keeps, tank on E
You know I'm gon' chase that money
You can bank on me still the same OG
I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees
I'm a survivor like my father
But that's word to my mama
Black Panther up in the Hollywood, I'm feeling like T'Challa
Not guilty your honor, only God can judge us
‘Cause you can kill a dreamer
But the dream lives forever
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 3]
Sirens in the rear view, two hundred on the dash
Carbon fiber curtains on the window
If I want some ass I’m bulletproof nigga
Ridin’ with that Teflon, motherfuck a canine
I'd rather raise a tec-nine
On the West Coast like I’m with Tha Dogg Pound
Niggas' dollars short as Bushwick Bill
Somehow they still talk down, that's crazy
Money-spinning like Tony with the 1080
Vino Valentino baby, I know the reason why they hate me
Keep a pocket rocket like T McGrady
But I never been lazy
I'm gon’ slide on you, you make me
Got my nine on me, no safety
Me and Ugly E pull up in the Wraith it got the stars on it, I'm spacey
On the moon rock like a meteorite
Chasing Ciroc with the Pedialyte
Show You Right
Shawty on that Barry White shit
Driving drunk without a license
She biting on my ear like Tyson
Busting gunshots off in the ear
Choppa sound like lightning, frightening
Jump in the six then do the dash like a hyphen
Skrrt
