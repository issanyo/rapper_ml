[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Color of morning pee coming out of the sink
It's 2016, who would think
Kids in America don't have clean water to drink?
Like they cut the EBT, took 'em off of the link
I read a story about a woman with her daughter in Flint
She got lead poisoning from showers in the morning
When the governor switched out the pipes to bring the water in
To the city river 'cause he said they can't afford to get clean water
So now the poor people get the shorter end
Of the stick, ain't that some bullshit?
Shorty thirsty, he just bought his fourth fifth
It's lead in the water gun, he dying from a full clip
Now you've got toddlers drinking toxic waste
While the people responsible still ain't caught no case
I don't get it man, I just ain't wit it man
They got Damn Daniel distracting you on Instagram
Back again with the all-white media coverage
They do it over and over like remedial subjects
The people with the least always gotta pay the most
We the first to go when they deleting them budgets
Can a nigga get his basic human rights?
Is that too much to ask? Should I say it more polite?
And everybody broke so we in the same boat
But would they let that bitch sink if we was white?
It got me shades of blue

[Hook: Vic Mensa]
Rain or shine, it's all blue, it's all blue
Ain't no sun, it's all blue, it's all blue
Purple haze, in a daze, it's all blue, it's all blue
Change gon' come, it's all you, it's all on you

[Post-Hook: Vic Mensa]
It's all blue, all blue
It's all blue, all blue
Night gon come so early but the skies stay gray
Around my way, around my way

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Waking up to the morning sun in Detroit
I'll be with the people when they come for the boy
Everybody tryna be American Idols
My X-Factor is I'm the only one with The Voice
It's bigger than us, these kids listen to us
That's why I give 'em that truth cause they don't get it enough
We making bitches and hoes out our women too much
We can't trust ourselves, and we don't know who to trust
It ain't enough for police to wear body cams
'Cause niggas still gettin' tazed and body slammed
And cigarettes'll kill you on their own
But they'll kill you for a cigarette, I honor Eric Garner fam'
I'm a part of him, he a part of me
I'm a prodigy in these Prada jeans
I'm tryna' make my partners a part of the election
So you ain't gotta presidential pardon me
And pardon me, but why is it that the darker must suffer?
How do we protect the culture from the vultures?
There's a Cold War every summer in the Chi
It's a snowball effect from the Cold War in Russia
But Vladimir Putin ain't in the hood recruitin'
And Derrick Rose ain't the only one out here shootin'
They set fire to their own squad cars
And a bitch on the news gon' blame it on the lootin'
Now here I am talking 'bout a revolution
And I can't even spare a dollar to the movement
But I'm in the strip club spending dollars on that movement
I guess we all got room for improvement

[Hook: Vic Mensa]
Rain or shine, it's all blue, it's all blue
Ain't no sun, it's all blue, it's all blue
Purple haze, in a daze, it's all blue, it's all blue
Change gon' come, it's all you, it's all on you

[Outro]
It's all you, it's all you, it's all you
It's all you, it's all you, it's all you
It's all you, it's all you, it's all you
It's all you, it's all you, it's all you, it's all you
