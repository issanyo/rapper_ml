[Verse 1]
Karma police
Arrest this man, he talks in maths
He buzzes like a fridge
He's like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party

[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

[Verse 2]
Karma police
I've given all I can, it's not enough
I've given all I can, but we're still on the payroll

[Chorus]
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
This is what you'll get
When you mess with us

[Outro]
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Just for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Ooh, oh yeah
Just for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
