[Chorus: THEY.]
Flip the switch, needing light
Blowing smoke to pass the time
Give an inch, losing miles
'Til I slowly fall behind
Somebody tell me what to live for?
Knocking at the same doors can't get in
I'm dying just to get more
Screaming at the sky "Lord answer me"

[Verse: Vic Mensa]
I'm a prisoner of my mind
I live inside of my pain
In solitary confines, no visitors allowed on my cage
I got rank like I'm Shabba, that's why a nigga stay behind shades (Let's go)
I got plan behind these Pradas and I got shame behind my rage (Yeah)
Never let 'em see sweat
Rag on my head like Raja bless a day, hit 'em in the ribs as a kid
Lotta shit changed since then, seen real nigga do fake
Seen phony niggas gettin' bread, put some on the books from the crooks and the county
You ain't one of us get the fuck from around me
Money on my mind so I look like a bounty
Twelve jumpin' out of foot to surround me
They can't hold me, AK loaded
Young Fresco got a MAC like Goldie
Call Lil' Moe, he'll whack your homie
Violent thoughts, I'm sad and lonely
How these hoes tryna Average Joe me?
Like a nigga ain't God level
Go tooth and nail with my demons
I'ma raise hell 'till I'm on God level somebody-

[Chorus 1: THEY.]
Somebody tell me what to live for? (Let's go)
Knocking at the same doors can't get in (Hey)
I'm dying just to get more
Screaming at the sky "Lord answer me"
Give me a sign, losing my mind
Losing it for real this time
Tell me what to live for?
Screaming at the sky "Lord answer me"
