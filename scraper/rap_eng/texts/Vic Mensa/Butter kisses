Chorus 1:
Cigarettes on cigarettes,Cigarettes on cigarettes,Cigarettes on cigarettes,Cigarettes on cigarettes

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

Verse 1:
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he’ll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my luck
She just yelling “Fuck me”
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Tonight she just yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese’s pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me yeaahhh
I know you still remember me

Chorus 1:
Cigarettes on cigarettes, Cigarettes on cigarettes, Cigarettes on cigarettes, Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes

Verse 2:
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the god
God knows he's a pro, he's pro like COINTEL
Check, check mate, check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, i mean normally
You see Norman Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, ‘till they can’t feel shit
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass.... then pass

Bridge:
I think we all addicted, I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, I think we all addicted

Chorus 3:
Cigarettes on cigarettes, Cigarettes on cigarettes, Cigarettes on cigarettes, Cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it’s dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
Cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses yeaaahhh...
