[Verse 1]
Look
Revolutionary, anonymous
Secret service want my  surveillance like I'm Obamas kids
16 shots and now they got me on a wiretap
Riding the trunk with the blunt
Jerk, fire that
Riding the track to Michigan, fighting the drug case
District attorney looking at me with the screw face
Do say, don't you know it's no hope with dope?
But he ain't know how dope I was, so I'd probably caught a new case
My suitcase is packed with Alexander McQueen shit
I call Wang personally
I don't need a seamstress
Plead the 5th plus I keep my chick in that Vera Wang
Rocking so much Wang, you'd thought it was the family name
Yeah, I know that I'm a target
So I drew it on myself
Let the industry be the marksmen
If you look close, you see that every bullet miss my frame
Them 16 shots around me not enough to count the names
From Tamir Rice to Mike to
Eric Garner, Freddie Gray
Oscar Grant, Eric Gray
What more can I say? (Uh)
Fucking A
Dance away the pain
Don't wanna hit with the quan
I do my dab to duck a stray
Pray for these shorties
They bankin' like West Side Story
But black on black crime is only one side of the story
You got them bodies hanging from trees in our recent past
You forget this the type of shit that they teach in class

[Verse 2]
When the Harriet Tubman's drop I need 20 G's
Free D'USSÉ for every slave she ever freed
Turn up and down to the underground railroad
The bouncers let my people go
Like Moses told the Pharaoh
Flow on the Whitney Museum taste level
Tasters on the Spotted Pig plate level
My London chick doing A-levels
Need a stunt double
I stunt like Rupert Murdoch got me feeling like a daredevil
I heard they try to ban the kids from the Soho House
That's cool, 40/40 kick it my photo ops
Write, direct and produce the video clips
Ya'll talk like bitches in the comments
Cause you're just a bunch of photo thots
Oh no, there he go
Promoting violence
They thought this rap was just for show
But this is no Empire shit
I'm no Hakeem
Hakeem the Dream
Olajuwon, my team
Keep the Houston rockin'
The clip is taller than Yao Ming
Never wanted to be about gun talk
But if you start me at them razors
I will let them guns off
This is just a disclaimer for anyone that wanna come for mine
I turn your life to bad karma when it's drama time
I got card crackers that'll yank your bank card
Run up in the Saks like
Thank you Based God
Oh, you don't know my name?
Better watch your damn words
You don't wanna end up with that
Kevin Durant curse
I’m Game 7 Steph
EP nothing but net
You want a physical
Martin Shkreli write a check
I'm going Wu-Tang forever
My crew paid forever
Savemoney with the Rocafella
My new gang forever
Vic
