[Intro: Vic Mensa]
Yeah, uh
All my peoples around the world
Flame up to this shit

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
She never wonder, she always knows me
When to chill or when to roll a blunt up  when I'm lonely
That she never trippin' if I'm tryna kick it with the homies
That she always givin' even if it's her weed that we be smokin'
That shit keep me high
I be chilling in the shade like Stevie Eye
Smoking in the whip, fuck a DUI
Never coming down, no ETI
Feeling like a Beastie Boy
Smokin' on that yolk
? took a head shot
Mama told me not to roll up in the house
So we took it to the park
Where a nigga' could spark
Those days were so forgetful
Runaway my memories
Only that killer weed, if not it's disrespectful
Like I said we rolling A's
Twisting on that loud
We don't do no boo boo gray
Nigga what's that you got going 'round?
If you was wonderin' I'm on it now
Bitch that's everyday
I'm in love with Mary Jane
Every bad bitch she keep me blazed
Guess it was meant to be
Cause I feel it's my destiny
Analyzing life's complexities
Got to thank the lord for blessing me with you

[Hook]
Callie and kush
Callie baby
You're the one for me
And Callie baby you're the one for me

[Verse 2: Donnie Trumpet]
She's sugar coated too sweet
Deserved the cover of Newsweek
Delivered the word from a looseleaf
Flew to me like a hoop dream
Too close to the stars
Sugar star, she's to close to the art
We to close to the star
Supposed to be smart
Close still far
So sugar for show for sure
I say sugar for show for sure
Sugar for show sure
I'll never be to far
My little amour
Ch√©rie amour
For what we have in store
Is for why I'm in it for
My galaxy forever more
Quoth the raven I'm safe in saying, "Nevermore"
Grassroots we pave
In case footing gets grave
Take five, wait on a wave
Ride out a wave
The way I ascended onto you
I do
I pretend it's on you
But understand
Don't underestimate this man
Blame it on the music
Not the callie and kush

[Hook]
Callie baby
You're the one for me
And Callie baby you're the one for me
Callie baby
You're the one for me
