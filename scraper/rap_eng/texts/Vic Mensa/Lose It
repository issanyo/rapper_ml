[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Put away your inhibitions
Let the beast in you just get loose
We all young, wild and different
We could all get lit from a lil' Goose
I know you’re terrified by what the future lies
But there’s no compromising, it’s my way or the highway
We all just played the lust, hard building breaking trust
She gon’ get wowed when we come out
Like she gon’ get loud when the weed come out this instant
Give a fuck what your friends think
Tell their bougie ass go wait in line
With them lame niggas talking real rap
Tell ‘em break your neck, go and bust a rhyme

[Pre-Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Blow one down, pass it around, ay-ay-ay
Fuck with me now, we’re running wild, ay-ay-ay-ay
Nobody game, we own the town, ay-ay, ay-ay
Never come down, I’ll never come down

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Lose it
I might lose it
Lose it
I might lose it

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Everybody got guilty pleasures
Mine just tend to catch me cases
Handcuffs, police inspections
Lawyers, judges, allegations
Turn on your favorite station
You hear the same old song
I feel like Nagasaki, dog
I’m ‘bout to drop the bomb

[Pre-Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Blow one down, pass it around, ay-ay-ay
Fuck with me now, we’re running wild, ay-ay-ay-ay
And nobody game, we own the town, ay-ay-ay
Never come down, I’ll never come down
Blow one down, pass it around, ay-ay-ay
Fuck with me now, we’re running wild, ay-ay-ay-ay
And nobody game, we own the town, ay-ay, ay-ay
Never come down, I’ll never come down

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Lose it
I might lose it
I might lose it
I might lose it
Lose it
I might lose it
I might lose it
I might lose it

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Lose it
I might lose it
