[Verse]
You know me, I'm spittin' game, talkin' slick, 17 hollow tips
Catch a clip like a Nikon, clap it like I turn the lights on
Lights off, then I drive off in a white Porsche, Leave White Chalk
We don't let bygones be bygones, we buy guns with extensions
Come get at me, fuck a mention, Twitter beef not litter me
Gucci shoes from Italy, Mike and Lebron, two 23
In my Mary Jeans, knots in 'em, might die sinnin', Lord willin'
Save-a-hoe's you Clark Kentin', do or die, I'm po' pimpin'
Do a suicide, windows tinted, buy a newer ride, blow dope in it
OG in my Raf Simmons, these niggas in Joe's Jeans
Seen young niggas turn dope fiends off of opioids, can't go clean
Cuttin' pills with the Fentanyl, off the meds, not Benadryl
I'm from the 'Raq, it's been a drill and all season we all schemin'
Last week they was all hatin', this week niggas' all pleadin'
Fed case on the front page on IG talkin' 'bout a murder
You was just on main stage, show's over, close curtains
Cold shoulder, my flow burnin', don't talk to me 'bout new music
These new niggas, new YouTubers, funny guys, Bo Burnham
I be going off like road runner, wildin' out like the coyote
At Burning Man on peyote, seven grand at KOD
Got undercovers chasin' me, undercover from Tokyo
In Shibuya gettin' buddha, smokin' gas, '92
But been in this shit since '93, look at all the shit they talk 'bout me
So-called beef, nigga rest in peace, guess I'm just too real for TV
Still gotta turn it on to see me, Vegeta chain off DBZ
No VV's on me please, but a nigga still Geechi
GDs and the BDs fuckin' with me off rip, I'm too legit
Bitch don't try no stupid shit, leave a nigga wet, no scuba shit
They gon' have to find you in the ocean on some Nemo shit
And this dope I'm rollin' came from jungle boys, it's 3 a zip
Y'all niggas hate to see me rich, niggas so fake, they like to sneak diss
Keep a .38 like a secret, leave a nigga face lookin' like deep dish
Ain't shit sweet, bitch, we seen 'em tear a nigga to pieces
I'm higher than Zenon - Zedis Lapidus
That's on some nerd shit, but I'm back on some street shit
Blow cocaine with a mop stick, pick 'em up like chopsticks
One day niggas best friends and the next day on some opp shit
BIG knew who shot Pac, Suge know who shot BIG
Good news they not dead, they still alive when I spit
Tell them niggas I got this, SAVEMONEY and the Roc, bitch
My squad still on my back, niggas foul so I keep that Tec, yeah
Saint Laurent boots out of Paris, yeah, call that a Euro-step, yeah
And call me lil Vic, they big mad 'bout how I dress
Fuck your baby mama in the shower 'cause that's motherfuckin' fresh
Now I just jumped up off the jet, I flew direct to LAX
I'm on P90X, me and Justin gotta Flex
Lotta zeros on my check, I need chemo, bitch I'm sick
Choppa make you D-low shuffle, have you boppin' to the left, Yeah, uh, catch your balance, baby, ride me like a stallion
Uh, yeah, give me that brain, uh, yeah, cerebellum
Yeah, uh, switchin' lanes with my gang on 67
Uh, yeah, I ain't Jimmy but I'm ridin' with that felon
See I'm back from the dead on you niggas
I roll with the stones like Jesus in the scriptures
Hold court with the folks, they throw forks with they fingers
That's a fact, I don't cap, I just graduate my figures
I could lacerate you bitches, I be cuttin' up them digits
They leave comments under pictures, say they comin' for my riches
But my address is listed *sips tea* get the lip then beat the beat Sonnie Liston, she want D, I'm not a Piston, G-O-D
I'm not a Christian, fuck police, fuck the system
They pussy niggas, gynecologists and obstetricians
That's a observation, complications with my father so my mind been racing
I was out of state when he go out of inpatient
Been patient, I ain't waitin' no more, I'm takin' the dough
7 figures like a phone number with no area code
I did a shoe deal with Puma when I was 20 years old
I could market sneakers and still wouldn't sell you my soul

[Outro]
That's how I run this shit
On some one hundred shit
