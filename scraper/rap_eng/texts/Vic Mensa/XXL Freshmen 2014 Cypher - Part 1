[Verse 1: Kevin Gates]
Lot of grievances and wish tales on the wrong niggas
K's sound like grey hounds, they long winded
Week start, high school sweetheart, what's wrong with him?
Black snake moan, tre-eight long as bone tissue
Lay on side my son and he's like ''Daddy, what's wrong?''
Few elusive habits, won't consider marriage I'm gone
I've been shot, I've been stabbed, had like cheap liquor
Slipped then got back on my feet like C. Billups
I done lost my money gambling, loudmouth rambling
Did a lot of lying 'til my women couldn't stand it
Nigga killed my brother so I took him from his family
Went and got some tears in my face, now I'm branded
All I ever wanted was some money like Sandy
Louis Vuitton shades for my dame, life fancy
Sweet face then I lick her pussy like nasty
But I ain't like her boyfriend if you was just asking

[Break: Vic Mensa]
Wait, who is this?
Ayo, wait, I don't know
I'm doing this XXL shit, I can't really talk on the phone right now

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Smack called me, I was getting some head
He said ''come do this XXL cover instead''
I said ''for sure, bust a bitch on the bed
Bust a nut on her head, tell me when and where and it's dead''
In the moment feels like a rush don't it?
Me hopping on the plane to fly to New York with no advance
From my non-existent label to spend
Money I'm spent, funded my tour in Europe
Paid it for myself
When a bunch of niggas' labels probably paid for the spot
I don't know, maybe not, could've been genuine
I laugh at Mr. Rogers in the hood
Told him why these niggas is brokeboys, they need reassembling
I'm Wimbledon, used to be innanet
Now I'm a free man like Morgan, free agent, three agents
The A&R man and a midget on my foreskin
Hey, Kobe, tell me how my ass taste
They should save my shit for the outtakes
I might take everyone out, flee the scene with the murder weapon
And a dick in your mouth, feet on your couch and my middle finger's up With my fucking Timb spot cause I don't give a fuck

[Hook: August Alsina]
Be on my grind and my hustle all day
Baby, I'mma shine, keep it bright always
And I be on the grind on the block all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
And baby I'mma shine like a light always
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day, yeah

[Verse 3: Isaiah Rashad]
Look, I'm on this XXL getting this paper
What I told her, she was slick as a fox
Sweet as the cadence, tell me, baby, you gon' love me or not?
With my dick in her mouth
I'm just chilling, my eyes glued to the ceiling
Just imagine getting closer to God
My uncle tried to stand on money then grab on something
Then have no knots and have no nothings and can't afford that
Swerving, just left service with Aunt Berlin
The Drama got her busy, this tenant is cart serving
Serving a junkie, maybe his family or something
That said that math just be exquisite when we pimping them bitches
Don't twist a cabinet in the kitchen unless you working them riches
Hold up, but we continue, we ain't washing no dishes
Laughing niggas laughing to the cashier
I don't really give a fuck
Getting to acting baffled, should not crash ya
Told you you'd get it, nigga

[Verse 4: Chance The Rapper]
Young black boy, how he got the labels scared?
A&R's be like "Chano, you ain't playin fair"
You gon' set a bad example for the average bear
You a yogi, you should idle while in child's position
I be like, naw, these my sons, this prenatal care
I'mma show 'em how to make it here and make it fair
Take it there they could kill me and I ain't gon' care
You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake
Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than Ableton
Make a plate and make it player, make 'em play it
Just don't count your sheep before they hatch
You chickens â€˜fore your eggs or eat 'fore you say your prayer

[Hook: August Alsina]
Be on my grind and my hustle all day
Baby, I'mma shine, keep it bright always
And I be on the grind on the block all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
And baby I'mma shine like a light always
You know I'mma grind, I'mma hustle all day
I'mma hustle all day, I'mma hustle all day, yeah
