[Intro: Sir Sly]
Chasing down the devil, devil
Chasing down the gods
And I hope you find
I hope you find your dream

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Twice in a lifetime, mouth made of metal & gold
Ice in the light shine bright 'til the bezel implodes
Blow the roof off the coupe pull the curve back returned that saying
Blood in my veins still red as a rose
Spent it all on a carpet
Slipping on my blue suede shoes
On a path, but a Jesus piece on my carcass
Let a couple karats cast, on the car to carry my coffin
To the mausoleum, trapped out the crib like Macaulay Culkin
Gold on the ceiling
They want to get my
Mother Mary would you move a rock to make it back
Or bag a brick to build a bridge that's big enough to never get back home
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
Now you're gone
Whole world tryna put gold down from the throne
But we just trying to get paid when you turn the radio on

[Verse 2: Sir Sly]
And what did you say back to me?
Dreaming, old maybach cruising
Maybe talking crazy, but I want it
A hundred thousand ways to choose it
Who the hell is out and who's in?
Trouble, maybe I'm too subtle

[Hook: Sir Sly]
Mouth is made of metal, metal, metal
Pocket full of yellow, yellow
Pocket full of gold
And I hope you find
I hope you find your dream
And darling never settle, settle, settle
Chasing down the devil, devil
Chasing down the gods
And I hope you find
I hope you find your dream

[Verse 3: Kami De Chukwu]
It could never be real as magic
My daddy used to have that candy caddy
I used to like the one with tinted windows
With the inches on the wheels, the gear shift all by it's automatic
Beating up myself with all them hits I could've been wrote
Run that race relaying, ran into a couple friends
Roller coaster, they'll drop you prolly when you least expect it
Saddest falling, lonely landing softly on a plateau
Poor me, poor me; I should pour me up some Chateau
Tell Geoffrey to bless me this a toast and I'm burning a couple bread loaves
I just got back, pass me a pack of them rillos
Sent them candles like the wax and we can burn up a meadow
If nothing was the same then you will never make no difference
The diamonds from the rough will rough you for your diamond necklace
Watch them corners boy you trippin', thinking backwards you could stumble
Get back up or fade to black I promise finish first position

[Outro: Sir Sly]
It's the push and the pull
It's the rise and the fall
I don't owe you a single thing
I don't owe you anything
It's the push and the pull
It's the big and the small
I don't owe you a single thing
I don't owe you anything(x2)
