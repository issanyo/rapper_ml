[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
And the city so cold
And the night so cold
And the women so cold
But the drinks so cold
And the life so cold
Why we living so cold?
Why is life so cold?
And the days so cold
And my ways so cold
And my art so cold
Made my heart so cold

[Bridge]
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
And the city so cold
And the night so cold
And the women so cold
But the drinks so cold
And the life so cold
Why we living so cold?
Why is life so cold?
And the days so cold
And my ways so cold
And my art so cold
Made my heart so cold
And all I got is these drums to keep me company

[Bridge]
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
I do lie, yeah, I do lie
