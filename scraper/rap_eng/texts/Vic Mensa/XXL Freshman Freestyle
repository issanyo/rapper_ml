[Intro]
Hello? Raping You Records?
Nah I ain't trying to sign

[Verse]
After this year I'll probably have a couple more friends
Couple more attention seekers trying to sneak up in the Benz
Ain't no space in the two-seater, choose either the coupe or your plans
Quit playing, the gameboy's in the palm of my hand
I might flex, just to show niggas who the fuck I am
Cocaina pure on the Pacific beaches and sand
What's better, than saying I would be and now I am
What's better, than watching the little bro become the man
