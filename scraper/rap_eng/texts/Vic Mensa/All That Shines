[Intro]
All that shines, is not gold
All that shines, is not gold
(Came up quick)

[Verse 1]
Yeah that's how it happened
Started off slim
Gained a lil weight rapping
Now I'm with the big boys
I'm with Hov out in New York City get M.I.A
Wilin' out with Diddy bumpin' D'angelo
Put your camera phones on
I need a billion lights
Twenty one, doubling through life
Like I lived it twice
Give your own advice
Nigga that's good advice
And the street lights will take you there
Take flight like Mike
When I stop at the light
Not even flashing lights behind me
Can stop me on sight
I see the vision
Of people divided and put in prison
For the government cheese
We get love overseas
Still bring that shit home like we smuggling keys
Dirty money, boy that's how I learned to stay awake
Niggas claim their bread heavy but they paperweight
We know ya'll ain't 'bout what you say
(Don't speak)
No doubt, everyday
I done struggled with doubts
Still spit this shit out
Snakes in the grass
Real niggas in house
Cause on the low the game so phony
Last night I had a real life dream
You wanna know what it feel like?
Like you'd done got away with everything
Then they get you for your tail lights
Shit it's real life
It's always something
Sounds like the beats in the hallways bumping
My nigga I'm grinding
You remember how that made you feel?
We in here and here to stay for real

[Chorus]
They say everything that glistens isn't gold
I know that this shit could come quick as it goes
(It shows)
The hoes, I never learning take it slow
Shit cause we came up quick
We came up quick
Yeah, we came up quick than a motherfucker

[Verse 2]
Last night I saw so and so
She ain't even know me though
Love in the club, wanna dip with Lil Romeo
Looking for a nigga bring in five or more figures
She broker than a bitch
But she don't vibe with broke niggas
Like Jean-Michel the SAMO, SAMO
Hoes love games:
Cubes, nintendos
Dread heads with me
Put your head on a halo
If I say so
But I'd rather speak to the peace
Kinda hard when there ain't no peace in the streets
Unless you got a piece
Then I'm saying peace
Niggas lie through their teeth
Head under their breath
Yo, when the president speaks
Why I feel like I'm deaf?
Sorry officer I'm not cooperating
I been too busy getting guapo-rated
Poppin' pills, not the ones the doctor gave me
It's okay, you have it your way

[Chorus]
They say everything that glistens isn't gold
I know that this shit could come quick as it goes
(It shows)
The hoes, I never learning take it slow
Shit cause we came up quick
We came up quick
Yeah, we came up quick than a motherfucker
