[Verse 1]
As I cried, every night
Tell me what’s it like, what’s a life
(To be running from your demons at night)
All alone, in the cold
Do your thing, giving in control
I just spazzed out, drunk and passed out
Fuckin’ last night, I was so high

[Hook]
I never wanna drink again
But if I do this one time
Then maybe you could bring a friend
A nigga need it my way
You know I need it my way

[Verse 2]
Midnight dreams in a house full of bitches
Crib for for the missus, whip for the misstress
Dirty dishes and white lines
Dark skin girl like night time
Yes I’m runnin’, runnin’ out of money
Did you take your pills today?
I don’t know man fuck my shrink
That bitch just wanna get paid
She knows I'm just placing the blame
For my actions all on the alcohol
I never meant to get God involved
Know my head high like Pau Gasol and I'm rolling
Do you hear me on that loud shit
Do you hear me, I got bad bitches all around me
I’m drunk

[Hook]
I never wanna drink again
But if i do this one time
Then maybe you can bring a friend
A nigga need it my way
You know i need it my way
I always call you when it’s dark out, 3 AM in Dover
Always come and eat your heart out 3 AM, 3 AM
Always say tell you turn the lights out, baby girl bend over
A nigga need it my way
You know I need it my way

[Verse 3]
He’s a lady killer
You don't care about any nigga's bitch
If she old enough to ride with her
She old enough to get hit
Oh why these girls so young
And they're just having fun with anyone
Just came from Vegas, just turned 21
Complications with a model chick
Having conversations on the modern life for the nigga Vic
Theres only one me and these girls love the D
How my dick supposed to be monogamous
I find the opposite
I think my shit be magnetized to these hoes man
She want a ride, road rage
Pour the drink

[Hook]
I never wanna drink again
But if i do this one time
Then maybe you can bring a friend
A nigga need it my way
You know i need it my way
I always call you when it’s dark out, 3 AM in Dover
Always come and eat your heart out 3 AM, 3 AM
Always say tell you turn the lights out, baby girl bend over
A nigga need it my way
You know I need it my way

[Outro]
She keeps calling me
She keeps calling me
She keeps calling me, closer, closer
The drugs keep calling me
The drugs keep calling me
They keep calling me, closer, closer
