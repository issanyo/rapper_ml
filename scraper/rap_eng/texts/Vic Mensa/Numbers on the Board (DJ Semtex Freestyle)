We in the middle of a war time
I ain't spittin' no empty punchlines
Nestle with the bars when it's crunch time
That chocolate skin get you locked in a bend
Some turned loony victim to a Giulliani servin' that Rudy to the booty
That's the chalks on
Keith Haren outlines in the school zone
Get his family a settlement, tell his mother to move on
The U-Haul's came and shipped niggas out the projects
They tore the buildings down and then they built a brand new target
And they wonder why shit is fucked up in the streets
Niggas selling CDs they gotta hustle to eat
I'm a hustler, once got robbed by a customer
Switched to rap, now I snap like DJ Mustard drums
Rednecks up in Oregon startin' their own militia
They pull 'em on the feds and they don't even mention the guns, yeah
You compare that to niggas with guns
You ain't even gotta reach, they put a clip in ya
Bullets hit your fibula, bystander film it on his cellular
Welcome to KKK-America
The rest of the world wonder why we shy on gun control
That's cause they're cashing in checks on every gun that's sold
See the NRA just like NBA
They let niggas play themselves then white men get paid
Not me, sir, no not I
I need money like method homie in *How High?*
I'm out [?] with my niggas, when I south it's southside
I be over east, sure ditch Vic I'm in the ride
Pull up with the man dem, them boys on a roll
Shuttin' down BET with Boy Bettah Know
Shout out to my trap star niggas, they get that dough
Wear a mask on their face so you boys never know
Listen I could go where you boys never go
The way I spit shit it's like you boys never flow
Came with the "Down on My Luck" and switched the tempo
They thought that was a pop start that was experimental
Trust me if, you try me they throw shots at your temple
I'm the dolly llama at the llama with a clip full
The game is a menstrual show, they bite your sound
Everybody wanna be black until the shit goes down
Then everybody turn your back, when I click scroll down
Your timeline, oh shit
You a hero now?
For the record, I ain't got any problem with Justin Timberlake
That's a media spin
Don't believe the shit they say
All I'm saying is, you got niggas that love you
So show that love to us back, 'cause they here in the struggle
My big homies you to come through in their mom lex' bubble
Two half black twins, like an Oreo double
I asked 'em what to do when Andrew called me a nigga
They said "call him white trash,"
Then he called me a nigga
And then I whooped his white ass, then he ain't call me a nigga
That's a little anecdote on equality, nigga
On the real, it wouldn't be no Martin without Malcolm
No march on Washington without the black panthers
And everywhere I go, they're asking me about the album
I just play like Sway, like, I ain't got the answers
I'm an atom bomb when I drop on niggas
I'm in them black [?] you forgot them niggas
I spit that
London flow for my Chi-town niggas
Semtex my day one, so I got that nigga
I'm out
