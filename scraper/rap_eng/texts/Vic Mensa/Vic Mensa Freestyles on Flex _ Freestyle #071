[Intro]
SAVEMONEY
We here
You know I always been waiting for my Flex freestyle for a long time

[Verse 1]
SAVEMONEY Roc boys, I rep the set faithfully
I'm a franchise player, there is no replacing me
KGs straight from the streets to the major league
And I'm puttin' niggas in they seats like a Maitre D'
Hov told me "Vic keep a foot on they neck"
We in Barclays ballin' like the Brooklyn Nets
I should have my own Mitchell & Ness
You remiss if I'm cancer at stage four, I'm as sick as it get
'Cause I spit like a kid with tourettes, triple the threat
I rap, produce, and I'm on the hook like a fish in the net
You just live with regrets
I should pledge Gamma Kappa, I ain't missin' a step
Caught a gun case for the Smith and Wesson, I'm so violent
Post bail like Chance, that's no problems
Right hand presidential like Joe Biden
Cut your girl in eyeliner like the old Rodman
I done sold products, rock low Pradas
Pop 'Lo collars, I'm so stylish
Trust me, nigga, I don't need no stylist
You dig me, I'm underground like Osama
What's a war in the Middle East?
I'm from the Mid-west where it's little peace, fuck a first week release
Victim of a key
Yes you unleash the beast like Ramo when I beat the street
When I speak MCs decease
Geez Louise, put Weezer on beats by No I.D
Fuck around at Up & Down, we don't show ID
I'm poppin', lil mama, what ya know 'bout me?
I was in the projects, you were checkin' your progress report
I was with the Lords shootin' for side bets
When I was sellin' O's in the complex
You was on the keyboard leavin' comments on Complex
I'm an anomaly, 2017 prodigy
Somethin' inside of me told me niggas ain't as hot as me
Everyone doubted me 'til my album let loose
Now they eatin' their words like alphabet soup
I swear, hate to say this my year, nah this my decade
Home with the Stones, Latin Kings and the esés
And I kick shit like Lionel Messi
Keep big clips as if I'm from the VA
Fuck you lames, I'm in the game like EA
You know how we play
Tell Flex drop a bomb on 'em like D-Day
I'm good with them shooters like Edai and Cdai
You ballin' on a budget, need a rebate from prive
Waldorf Astoria, that's where we stay
In a Delorean, I'm back to the future
Sippin' somethin' purple and it's not kombucha
I was in Nordstrom, backpacks with the boosters
Now I hit Saks, six stacks with the rooster, nigga
Early

[Verse 2]
The youth is lost, they said they need someone to believe in
We forgot the dream since Martin Luther's kingdom
We ain't in Kansas no more, Toto
Them yellow bricks on the road filled with dope and coke
Folks post on cold blocks where popo don't go
And ambulances don't show if you're Black and Latino
Happy yuppies move in with puppies and cappuccinos
And try to take ya out like Ginger in Casino
But we still pop Ace, beat the case
Public enemy number one, "Bass in your face"
Trey 8 on the waist, vacays out of state
Eat filets for the steaks, screamin', "Fuck the jakes"
If I could rule the world, I'd free 'em all, Mumia Jamal
Aaliyah flight wouldn't have took that fall
Colin Kaepernick would still play ball
They treat niggas like MC Shan and keep us down by law
Fuck is MCs sayin'? I don't sound like y'all
I sound like E.D.I. Mean, I'm an outlaw
I know Flex don't really rock with Pac
I'm still screamin' Makaveli 'til the coffin drop
I rock chains like a slave on the auction block
Overall I'm the best, OshKosh B'Gosh
I'm old school like Al Po and Jimmy Henchmen
SAVEMONEY on the arm but I ain't penny pinchin'
I'm with my entourage like Vinny's intervention
I'm a Chi town legend like Willie Dixon
When they sayin', "Who the nicest?" gotta give me mention
Blow your brains out like I'm Siddy Vicious
Silly women really wanna be Beyoncé
Word to Kanye West, I call that Taylor Swiftin'
Don't be mad, I'm just riffin'
Mike from the Chi and I'm just pimpin'
Hot 97, y'all just slippin'
I'm a rockstar, style to be specific, nigga
