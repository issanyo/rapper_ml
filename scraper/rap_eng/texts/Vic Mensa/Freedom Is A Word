[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Pour the 1800 in a tall glass, let’s go crazy tonight the world’s gone mad
Subliminal slavery, take a knee with the ball players
And they want to put you out the class with no hall pass
None the less, puff my chest
Never see me sweat
So ahead of my time my parents haven’t even met
Word to Big L, I see the big picture
And when the closing credits roll it’s no Vic Mensa, just Victor
Now just listen, I sing you my song of pain, blood, sweat, and tears
But they still take the flow in vein
That’s why the music is my Novocain
I feel like David Bowie I been under pressure but I’m over fame
But who’s to blame, I can’t accuse the game
Swerving on the road to riches but they trying to tell me to choose a lane
Play the flutes like a brut champagne
It’s like the whole planets losing its brain
I think the world’s gone mad

[Verse 2 : Vic Mensa]
Speaking for my generation this is innovation
Trying to bring unity to this divided nation
Tired of being patient, while they diagnose us
They say I’m short-sighted I think y’all just out of focus
Slept by the roaches, learned to fly with the vultures
Purple heart beating for all my Chicago soldiers
From the warzone to the world tour zone
I’m the man now but mama your boy’s home
I never left, like violins I never fret
Though the threat of violence is forever present
Take a trip down memory lane I’m reminiscing
We ain’t have a window to throw it out of or a pot to piss in
They don’t understand the youth because they don’t try to listen
Niggas dying young in the streets because they tired of living
Tired of lies from the politicians
Open your eyes I’ll supply the vision
Of how the world gone mad

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Freedom is a word that I’ve never known (x3)
Freedom is a word, Freedom is a word (x)
Freedom is a word that I’ve never known (x3)
Freedom is a word, Freedom is a word (x)
