Leave it up to the morning
To take away your pain, make you whole again
Leave it up to the morning
To wash away your sins, a simple man, I wish I was
Leave it up to the morning
Dirty shoe laces on the telephone line, white powder on the table
Leave it up to the morning
When the evening comes

Hollywood, Los Angeles
Holly Wood, Los Angeles
Wanna know you’re so talented
Don’t know how you gonna balance it
Between all the white lines, and the night clubs at night time
Well, I will say at least you would be the best candidate
The prototype
Leave it up to the morning

I woke up in a butterflies cocoon covered in cosmic dust
Fell down from the heavens when I held out my hand in hell
In God we Trust
Money in my palm, trees, shades, sand and the beach
Changing the sheets, Cheap trick we met last night
I like a little bark and a bitch that bite

I don’t mean to be rude but you so beautiful
A fool I’d be to let you go
Go and tell your friends you fell in love with someone you barely know
Do you, fall asleep and watch the sun like I do
So when you feel me missing there beside you
Leave it up to the morning
To wash away your sins, simple life, I wish it was
