[Verse: Vic Mensa]
Visions of Malcolm X staring at me
Out the window with the tec if it's to protect my family
I stand over y'all, don't mean you understand me
Sold grams hand to hand, I rap like I won a Grammy
All black leathers, that's the dress code
Tatted up across my stomach like I'm Esco
Pyrex stove, Rolex gold
It's dead bodies in the wild like asbestos
Skeletons in the closet, I'm picking up the bones
Tryna build a happy house from a land of broken homes
Folks and stones turn into fiends, now they smoking stones
Ain't shit free but I'm tryna break free like a Toblerone
Grapes street to state street, I'm global like Jojo Capone
Chief back shout out to Bump J the bro is home
Shout out to Goon Squad, OTF [?]
Niggas trapped the hardest, Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone
When any night could be your last all my days of precious
We was restricted from elections cause we in state corrections
Making them bricks disappear like we playing Tetris
And all I hear is the same questions interviews
Wanna pin the news in my city to benefit they business
That shit is whack that's why I call you DJ Wackademiks
I'm a menace, off top but I'm far from finished
All my niggas bulking big, rolling that Popeye spinach
R.I.P to Pimp C, for you I'm still getting throwed
Rest in peace to Prodigy, young but my mind is old
Grew up a screw up with niggas that never knew they father
Had to learn how to swim with the sharks like a scuba diver
Yeah, visions of Huey Newton staring at me
I live my life behind these bars, I should be wearing khakis
I'm barely happy, my homie just caught a homicide
He tried to hang himself in a cell, he was traumatized
Y'all I tell a lot of lies, you should be embarrassed
You getting fucked for the fame, one night in Paris
This is my life in lyrics, I either write or perish
I'ma sniper on the Eiffel with a rifle, Rikers Island
Couldn't stifle my spirit, I am Kalief Browder
Penetrating the industry, she been deflowered
Remember me with the legends, Kobains and the Hendrix
I should die at 27, still alive at 24
If there's a God in the heavens how he let niggas starve
How he let them kill Rod, believing is hard
Live life by the sword, meet the light of the lord
Cut his stomach open just like an umbilical cord
I fight an invisible war, every night I'm paranoid
Fill the void with squares and lean like a trapezoid
Uh, my flow touch you like a Catholic boy
Yeah, Devil working so I'm self employed
Hell fire, the messiah of my generation
They say flattery's the higher form of imitation
But I been patiently waiting while they hating and biting me
Now I'm ready to blow like a Shell station

(This always been a beat that I really, really fucked with)

Yeah, uh, the judge tryna throw the book at me
Uh, I wish they, I wish they would catch me lacking
Never happen, down for action, I grew up fast
Like a young Michael Jackson living in the life of lavish
Disillusioned, the hyperactive, misconstrued as some type of savage threat to me in prison blues them biker jackets
Yeah, uh, I'm tryna find my magic
I'm tryna find my magic, hold up
I say that I don't.... Autobiography is out today
Like Frank Sinatra did it my way
And never needed a verse from Jay-Z or Kanye
Word up
