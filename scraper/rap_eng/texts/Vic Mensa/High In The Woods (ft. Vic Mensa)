[Verse 1: Johan]
Can you pick me up
In your Chevy truck?
I still got some buds (yeah)
We’ll go to da spot
By jumping rock In the cloak of dark (yeah)
It's one a.m., this town is dead
It's Friday night inside my head
But it's Tuesday night for everybody else
I'm on the curb, my hood is up
It's gettin' cold and you pull up
Ain't nothin' new to do since we were twelve (yeah)

[Chorus: Johan]
Let's go get high in the woods
Let's go get high in the woods
Let's go get high in the woods
And let our secrets out, yeah

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Pick me up in your suburban
We sippin' bourbon and swervin'
TLC creepin', I be lurkin'
I might need a doctor, call Julius Erving
Back in 9th grade I was smokin' and servin'
Call me Johnny Tsunami, I'm on the snow but I'm surfin'
Laughin' like I'm a jackal, I might turn into Mr. Hyde
Don't let me get to high, I'm like a whole different person
Vic, where you from? Wish-A-Nigga Woods
M. Night Shyamalan when I split the 'Wood
I am lightyears past just a little buzz
I be in the stars, I could give a spaceship a hug
I just heard my car talk to me, Shia Labeouf
I just rolled a green lightsaber, Skywalker kush
Holy Moses, find me floatin' off a burnin' bush
I could talk to God, I'm so high in the woods

[Chorus: Johan & Vic Mensa]
Let's go get high in the woods (yeah)
Let's go get high in the woods (SAVEMONEY)
Let's go get high in the woods (yeah)
And let our secrets out, yeah

[Bridge: Johan]
Let’s go get high in the woods, yeah
Let’s go get high in the woods, woo
Let’s go get high in the woods
And let our secrets out yeah, ooh

[Chorus: Johan & Vic Mensa]
Let's go get high in the woods (yeah)
Let's go get high in the woods
Let's go get high in the woods (yeah)
And let our secrets out, yeah

[Outro: Vic Mensa]
What's my fuckin' name?
Mic Vensa?
Mic Vensa!
