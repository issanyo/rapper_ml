[Verse 1: Kami de Chukwu]
Fuck ‘em, beat ‘em up, cuff ‘em
All up in that wagon where them boys done chucked ‘em
Chocolate, took a nigga wheels just for puffin’
Locked him in a dungeon, always left his tummy rumblin, bubblin
Told him that he seen better days, the nightfall came but he dreamed a better way
And the thoughts on his mind always seemed to display
A scene of dismay on the screen that just play
All and all forever understand it’s never over
Sip that heavy liquor ‘til you feelin’ light all over
Drop a couple tracks ‘til them bitches bending over
And a bubble butt slut's tricking out for your quota
Pimp, always let his cup runneth over
Simps, tearing up when they hearts broken
Him, never gave a fuck about all of that
Money, fam, and music and we here to save all of that
Savemoney baller raps, off the top them baller hats, dunkin’ on them smaller cats, poised to be the [?] raps
Snitches, bitches, who be all up at your soul
At your money, at your gold, at your dreams, at your goals
A nigga never fold, ‘cause he had to play his cards right
Surely you will shine bright when you step in limelight
Words of advice to my homies who be hustlin’
Every butter for my brothers, never fuck with English muffins, cousin
Mama thought her son would be nothing
Turned a bunch of nothing to a whole lot of something
All he ever wanted was Mama’s sweet loving
A couple pies baked ready straight up out the oven
Got these fiends buzzing, loving on the product
Savemoney like I’m serving sauce for the five buck
Throw them fives up, pay respect to my fam
Savemoney be the clan and Chicago be the land, God damn
How you count them thoughts off the treetops
Kept ‘em pumped up like an old pair of Reeboks
Shout my nigga Reese, make ‘em buckle at they knee socks
One hitter quitters to the face, make them knees pop
So please stop, don’t do it
It’s off of the top more often than not
I’m battling cops, in the studio strapped with my guys
And I be moving with the Savemoney clan on the fly, ‘til I die

[Hook: Michael Anthony]
If you come from my home
You’ll probably catch me in the Windy, off some Sweets and some Remy
I don’t sleep, we be winning
If you come from my home
You know the opps on the rise, when we see ‘em we say fuck ‘em
Savemoney still alive
If you come from my home
You’ll probably catch us on a train in a daze, 20 deep blowing loud at the lames
If you come from my home
Eyes scorched, jealous thoughts tryin' to derail us

[Verse 2: Caleb James]
From the city where real gangsters wear they hat to the right
Little kids on the corner selling crack for the pipe
Where out of town rappers come and gotta tuck in they ice
But ain’t no other city better, I put that on my life
This for my niggas on the grind with a jab in they sock
For my nigga on the west side, hugging the block
Never been arrested, but I have no love for a cop
I had my hands on keyboards trying to be like my pops
So, you gon’ say I ain't no real nigga, boy
Been had the bread before deal nigga
You see, I be chilling with them ill niggas
One call away and make you disappear like David Copperfield nigga
Pop then go vanish, holding my cannon for niggas that up [?]
I hope we out jam ‘em, Savemoney that’s the family, know we do damage
Five finger discount, you know they can’t stand us like

[Verse 3: Chance the Rapper]
Mama mia, ooh I’m a dreamer, burn up this for Rod, turn up this for Tina
Chance the Rapper, ooh Chance le Rapper
I speak France, Jones my Alma Mater
All that matters is mistakes and ladders
Slick snakes and comeups, mixtapes and chatter
Igh, pause
As our laughter, draft up my master plan faster faster
Chance the rap master, Fax in my taxes, shows is my classes, drugs is my FAFSA
Kami de Chukwu, modern day guru
Save monetary, my mama say [?]
Roost in the morn, sing through the yawns
I know your eyes heavy, but rest when you’re gone
You say you save money, but say sunny nigga
They saying they need you, you stay then you left em, Igh

[Hook]
[Michael Anthony]
If you come from my home
I'd probably Cobain if it wasn't for the  [?] and the feelings
If you come from my home

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
We’re all lil niggas, got all lil triggers, done all got bigger
(If you come from my home)
Then let ‘em know you bout it nigga
If you from the Chi throw up your “C’s”

[Verse 4: Vic Mensa]
From my block to your block, from Hyde Park to O Block
I’m southside to Oak Street to downtown to dope spots
Up in the smoke lot, up in the murder scene
They say you make ‘em come true, they wanna come kill your dreams
They pulling bangers on you, now tell me what you gon’ do
Either you fight or you run, you either win or you lose
There too many options where they poppin’ If I’m gone before they [?] was a problem
I know I kiss a killer like I’m rocking right beside him
In the fall they took my nigga, though the laws ain't never find him
I’m dead every day, if don't risk it then you never finna get shit
I learned the bigger the role, the bigger the pot that you done pissed with
Teachers thought we was punks, back in school we was the misfits
Used to serve in the days, after school I did the dishes
Shoutout to my boss who fired me on some bitch shit
And all the teachers who said I’d never get shit

[Hook]
