[Verse]
What's your life like?
Mine's at 7:30
I stay up all night and go to sleep hella early
Jet-lagged victor choppin' up at the jet rag
Up on Labreia ave just praying my last checked cash
Spend a month that I barely have
Just to maintain an image in LAX for the winters
And still look cold in Chicago in December
And take it back to next week like [?] testing centers
Now I'm scrabbling like why the fuck I buy that flight
To Miami, it was a wild ass night
Fucked my ex against all of my better advice
Even after the homewrecker, this is a wild ass life
I can't front though I love it much as I stress it
As going back to college is really out of the question
And ever since a freshman I been knowing that I was destined
To be on this stage swear to god this is my testament
And I got messages, yeah I got messages
My bars should be coming as SMSing shit
They got lead in the water in Flint, Michigan
As black people go through a slow motion massacre
I never pretended to not give a fuck
The problem isn't I don't care it's that I care too much
They keep the blue print because they don't want to...
