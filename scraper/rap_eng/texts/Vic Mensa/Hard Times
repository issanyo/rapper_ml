[Hook: Liam and Macie]
My mother told me never to tell, a dirty old lie
My mother told me never to sell, and just to get by

[Verse 1: Asher Roth]
It's been a long damn summer
And I've been working by the furnace, fire burning
An inferno with a purpose, feeling like I don't deserve this
Like I've been cursed, I don't need your sympathy
Although I know you know it hurts - it ain't perfect
Life's not no nursery rhyme
It's as much of a blur as it is our whole lifetime
And that's fine, I'mma ride with it, take my time with it
Never underestimate the power of the blindness
Yes, your highness. Follow your instincts
Fingerprints ain't always gonna match the logistics
Little bit different, it isn't your typical
Won't always do to others what you wish was reciprocal
My brothers and sisters all the way out there in Liverpool
I feel you a hundred numbers ?
Don't ever fall in love, cum in somebody's number two
You may call it dumb but true
You know that we're coming for you: mama said

My mother told me never to tell, a dirty old lie
My mother told me never to sell, and just to get by

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Lord knows I take my secrets to the grave
Til I'm in a crown, I'm on my own two
Coming straight from a chunk of cave money
King Kong crew. (It's going down)
Swimmin in the river with a stone shoe
But I be in that bitch still kicking, I'll teach you kung-fu
Show and prove, the whole team be on the same page
Niggas telling me I'm their idol and we the same age
While back, it wasn't nothing in my mind but stayin blazed
Now picking bitches, calling options like I'm sayin plays
Take a picture mayne, I'm on some magazine spread shit
Hold the mic tight, I got that rigor mortis dead grip
Got some good brain on the road, I'd say head trip
Fuck her face and bust on her mouth: call her lead lip
I'm the baker, I make the bread flip
Niggas be wildin' but you could talk like it's crackin'
To get your eggs split
Shells drop and it's an everyday thing
It's a shame, but it's all a part of the game

[Hook: Liam and Macie]
My mother told me never to tell, a dirty old lie
My mother told me never to sell, and just to get by

[Verse 3: Casie Veggies]
Young boss, new dreams
Fresh shoes, new jeans
Tell me what do you see?
Why you tryna do me?
So I had to find out, now you can't find me
Remember three years ago? Like "why you can't sign me?"
Thoughts in my mind, I can do all that times three
I grew up not a young'un like "nevermind me""
Born '93, took time to find where my mind be
Now I tell time with gold time piece
My mama told me grind..

[Hook: Liam and Macie]
My mother told me never to tell, a dirty old lie
My mother told me never to sell, and just to get by
