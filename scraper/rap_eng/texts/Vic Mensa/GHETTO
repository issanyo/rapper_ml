"Earth and related dimensions..."

[Intro]
Are you out of your fucking mind
It ain't shit on earth that you can't possibly do around here, or possibly say
If you don't know about these motherfuckers, then they're going to blow you out the way
Man motherfucker, this the Kids These Days. Yeah!

[Vic Mensa]
Then say no more, this is what I'm here for
I leave 40 niggas sitting by the airport
I'm on the redeye flight the next morning
10 Deep tee-d up, all black chucks and jeans so g'd up
Bossed up the bad ones get tossed up, and tossed out
Ain't shit to talk about. Flossed out lambs get crossed out
Kill a show, nigga leave the whole crowd chalked out
Walked out like it ain't shit happened
Niggas listen when it's Vic rappin'
No need to ask when the show, show me the cash I'm in the shop like the heat of blast, Pop!
It's like ten dead bodies in the weekend, so don't tell me that I'm tweakin'
Niggas set 'em up left this whole shit leaking, we ain't on that we just blow it back

[Hook x3]
Tell it like it's me, and you, just doing the shit that we do
If you smoke, you drink, or give a fuck about what they think
I tell them what's up, what's good
Can't stop me but they wish they could
Won't try me but I wish they would

Call it 'ghetto music' because it's just that hood, look at it like...

[Instrumental: Move On Up sample]
L-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-live from the past

[Vic]
Dream big, live fast, die young, crash the moon
And only pray to Jesus at the times we need atonement
I swear I'm to the point where home is like a omen
Slow dancing with the devil, but don't stop me now I'm Sondheim
What's the problem, niggas want to get jumped like Shonen
When in Rome bring that shit to the mother fucking Romans
A hundred niggas laid to rest beneath the slave ship
I see em in my dreams on a grave ship
They say the ends coming soon
I can't stop watching it with my eyes closed
Lined up presidents wearing blindfolds underneath the black ditches
We speak soft but funny, act vicious
We made them check to distract bitches
Was taught to be cold blooded cuz loves this thing about you that you play
You can't be Romeo and Juliet and love until the grave
This is the final hour
The last chapter book of Revelation
Tell them that I'm coming book your reservations
