[Chorus: Guapo Miguel]
I need a filter
On what I’ve been drinking
It got me tripping
Thinking I love you
But maybe I’m tweeking
I’ll throw these dollars
I’ll keep on throwing these dollars

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
All my hoes come home in two’s
Two in the morning, that’s double time
Did it for ‘dentity, niggas can’t do
Who you think get the keys to the summertime?
Single them out
Leave them on track like acapellas
Let the doctor tell them
Flow so third floor at the hospital ward
Hopping off the boat
Meeting papi at the docks
Twisted like a rope
From trying to tie me in a knot
Put him in a box
Leave him in the dirt
Nail in the coffin
Outlining chalk for talking
Like shut up bitch, twerk
Snotty nostrils
Highly potent hybrid inside my Tommy boxers
Jabbing to jock, bitch hold my dick
Glock 7 like four, five, six, no shit
New boys, no beef
No talk, I see no reason
Even need my cash before I leave
Or leave them barely even breathing
Bordering insanity
Danity dancing with that ‘caine
Jacking hoes for Kennedy’s
Careless world in this vicious game
Innanet

[Chorus: Guapo Miguel]
I need a filter
On what I’ve been drinking
Cause it got me tripping
Thinking I love you
But maybe I’m tweeking
I’ll keep on throwing these dollars

[Verse 2: Candy Irene]
And please do
I’ma groove, I’ma move like I need to
And we be at it front-back in a four-door
You thinking love
I’m thinking plug got you wide-nosed
Oh my, my, my
I got problems with promissory
And value itinerary
That lead me on a route to a fool around
Let me know when you’re pulling up
Pour up when I’m coming down
Come and find me at the Gentlemen’s Club

[Chorus: Guapo Miguel]
I need a filter
On what I’ve been drinking
It got me tripping
Thinking I love you
But maybe I’m tweeking
I’ll throw these dollars
I’ll keep on throwing these dollars

[Post-Chorus: Nick Carter Green]
I need an escape
Someone to believe in
Someone to tell me that this shit
That we doing can go pass the weekend
I’ma keep throwing these dollars

[Bridge: Nick Carter Green]
Shranklin’s raining on your body
Shranklin’s keep on raining on your body

[Verse 3: Nick Carter Green]
New Porsche off the check
And they know when I’m coming through
I just popped the trunk
But I swear that that shit the roof
My bitch, she just seen it
I swear that she hit the roof
I keep spitting on them
You’d swear that I miss a tooth
Know when I come
And they know when I did it
These bad little bitches
I swear that they’re pretty
Not pretty as me though
Switching lanes, switches lanes
Getting dames, getting dames

[Chorus: Guapo Miguel]
I need a filter
On what I’ve been drinking
It got me tripping
Thinking I love you
But maybe I’m tweeking
I’ll throw these dollars
I’ll keep on throwing these dollars
