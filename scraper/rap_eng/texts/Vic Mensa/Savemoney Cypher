[Verse 1: Caleb James]
All my real niggas holler
I'm out here bout a dollar
If you speak another language, holler at your guala
'Bout the cheese, 'bout the bread, 'bout the cake
You could take a break but in the meantime in between time
I make enough cash to rake and replace the sand by the lake
And only eat potatoes and steak
I ride around town with something so fine, it make you frown in the passenger
Nigga come for mines, and I'm blasting ya
It'd be mad static, it'd be mad tragic
'Cause I can't run after you dog, I'm a asthmatic
But I roll green like the slim change in my jeans, or the team from Boston
That'll probably put me in a coffin from coughing
But I do this often
Niggas know I'm falling off topic but I get it right up in the pocket
Niggas know I'm plugged like a socket
Blast off like a rocket when I rock the cypher
Hoes follow me like Pied Piper
You can't find none nicer
Shitting on niggas, I'm needing diapers
Niggas know ain't no need for mean mugs and shoulder shoves
And I'm in the club wit my nigga Chance
Its all love

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
And it's all love
I'm looking for some hoes I can call up
And all them niggas with 'em gettin' balled up
Put your cash up
Its the same old dance and they can flash mob
Apologies for my Savemoney philosophies
Young Socrates, Sophocles, Ptolemies
Building a monopoly, never practice monogamy
Harness all the bad my parents couldn't beat outta me
So take a piece of mind
Robbery, lobotomy
And I'm a cocky asshole, but that's a different side of me
Well death is a coincidence, life is an anomaly
So death to all of yesterday and viva la tomorrow G
My homies push weight forward with scales
To get they grind on like skateboards and rails
Never hit a treflip, but they can hit a stain quick
Hit a wipe out and cops shove 'em in jails
So fuck what them say
Savemoney all day, but this is my 10 Day
If your pocket says is I need to get rent paid
Guess this the Savemoney bank job, put that on my tank top

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
It's the paid money bank mob
Write it on everything, give your hood a new paint job
It's niggas with children, put the crown up
Buildin' what you think Bob
In the party, sippin' and dancin' 'till my drank drop
I could steal the show, it ain't a song a nigga can't rob
Riding down Cottage, Me, Joey and K Rock
My nigga don't quit your day job
I'm face late husband mixed with a little face mob
Go and turn the fuck up out the bass knob
Nigga it Savemoney, yo let whoever have the most to drink, drive
Crash burn, pass niggas and cash earn
Cremate rappers leave the ashes in the glass urn
You don't wanna try me, that be nonsense
You don't want beef and I don't want that on my conscience
So stay cool
I stack O's, push Q's like I play pool
Fuck a textbook, fuck a teacher cause I hate school
Straight fool, I go dummy when the beat drop
In a treehouse getting blunted in the treetop
Know only come with that heat, rock
Smokin' in the heat box, busting a beat box
Biatch

[Verse 4: Malcolm London]
Built from the ground up like a sky scraper
Off the high dropping niggas, call us some sky scrapers
Savemoney stacked like a spy nigga get back
Got your girl dripping and she can get waxed in fact
Never weighed down, even with all the ounces we inhale
Lungs in jail, guess you could say we spit bars
Guess you could say we never sleep
Continue to resist arrest
Not a crew, not a clique
This is a revolution, this is an evolution
You got problems, and we got solutions
Years of institutions leave you always on your toes
Hard for a nigga to heal
Walking Chi City streets bring pressure
Leaving diamonds in our chest
Souls like steel
Built from the ground up, no beef unless you want it
And we never standing still, battle royale and we standing still
Savemoney, save music, save minds
My nigga Caleb James, blowing up like land mines
So don't step
At y'all necks like a tie
Bo Squad, built from the ground up

Niggas ain't Savemoney you a bitch
Taylor Gang, Taylor Gang
