[Verse]
Look, first of all I want to thank my connect
For telling the world off top who got next
I'm waiting on my chain, but still a lot on my chest
From standing on porches to standing on couches
I post a picture and they bitching my outfits
I'm on my Prim shit game blouses
Roc fam in the building tonight
Oh what a feeling, I'm killing y'all life
I know niggas is shitty, I'm in Vegas with Diddy
Bitch I think I'm Diddy when I'm in my city
Or should I say Hov that's the CEO
A nigga come sideways and I'm at his throat
Hit the neck then, watch how the body float
You maric√≥ns I party on, raise a toast
