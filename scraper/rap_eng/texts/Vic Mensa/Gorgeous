[Intro: Vic Mensa]
This for all my niggas that ever got caught up, haha
Fuckin' with two, cause it's too hard to say no
I know, I know, I know, cause you gorgeous

[Pre-Chorus: Vic Mensa]
She caught you, I know
Fuckin' in the bathroom, in my home
Call me selfish, but I want you both
And that's what makes it so damn hard to let you go

[Chorus: Vic Mensa & Syd]
'Cause girl you're gorgeous, go 'head
I feel gorgeous in your hands
She not ugly, I want you to know
That you're gorgeous, oh yeah

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
I don't wanna fuss or fight, not tonight
Let's catch a flight, get fly tonight, uh
I'll be your pilot, get high tonight, uh
You wanna own me like copyright
But shootin' stars so hard to hold down
Red bottoms, red carpet, we paint the whole town
Call concierge, forgot to put a condom on
But shit it's the Mondrian Hotel
Get you an Agent Provocateur
She got expensive taste in lingerie
She say it's too hard to keep it
Oops, we just dropped Victoria Secret
It's like that, I might act quite an ass, I might add
But she can detect a bitch from an eyelash
I know I was wrong, that was my bad
She had a pumpkin ass, how could I not smash?
You don't gotta hold that against me
I just wanna hold that against me
Grab you Giv-en-chy, I mean Givenchy
Then she seen my side piece in the front seat, uh-oh
(Nigga who the hell is this?) Here we go
Why you gotta turn up everywhere we go?
How my ex turn up everywhere we go?
It ain't my fault that I want you both

[Chorus: Vic Mensa & Syd]
'Cause you're gorgeous, go 'head
I feel gorgeous in your hands
Shit got ugly, I want you to know
That you're gorgeous, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
We can't stop, we so addicted
Unconditional prescriptions
Keep me from these crazy bitches
Sittin' there, see somethin' vicious
Break in my house and you steal my car
After all that and you still my broad
I'll beat a nigga ass 'bout you, on God
Tell my new girl, better stay on guard
All in the store tryna go O-Dog
Poppin' at the sales clerk in a lil' skirt
Talkin' 'bout she looked at me wrong
You must be high, what drugs are you on?
Whatever it is, you got me hooked
Whatever it is, you got my new girl shook
First you wanna break somethin' then you wanna make love
Pshhh, ain't no such thing as halfway crooks
Halfway home and my phone blowin' up
Paranoid, I don't wanna open it up
Cause I be textin' these hoes too much
If she see her name, she get Goku tough
So I just keep it on silent, keep on ridin'
Shorty gon' keep on wildin'
But when you smile, it makes it all okay

[Chorus: Vic Mensa & Syd]
Because you're gorgeous, go 'head
I feel gorgeous in your hands
I don't wanna love you, so fuckin' bad
But you're gorgeous

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go 'head
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go 'head
Act crazy girl, go, go, go, go, go, go 'head
Act crazy girl, act crazy, act, act crazy girl, go 'head

[Outro: Vic Mensa & Syd]
You're so gorgeous, you're so gorgeous
You're so gorgeous
You're so gorgeous, you're so gorgeous
You're so gorgeous
You're so gorgeous, you're so gorgeous
You're so gorgeous
You're so gorgeous, you're so gorgeous
You're so gorgeous
