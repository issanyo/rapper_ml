[Chorus: Moxia Raia]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down
And I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

[Verse 1: Moxie Raia]
And you know you got a girl and a baby
What's your excuse to be living all crazy?
And he look me right square in the eye
And said "honestly don't you know the media lies," he said
"I should've never been famous
But they made us all stars
And the way that they framed us
I was just a teenager
You know I had my whole life tell me where did it go, c'mon"

[Chorus: Moxia Raia]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down
And I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Uh
Yeah, I hear you queen
We all got problems
All got mothers
Some of us ain't got fathers
All got priors
All Southsiders
But I just wanna see my kids, Mrs. Doubtfire
So I'm out here grinding to the sunset
Tryna make sure that my son set or daughter
That's the reason why I'm on that corner
Cause minimum wage so unsupportive
You know
Baby father drama
That shit crazy
Sometimes I hate her momma but I love the baby
I don't want to tell her daddy's gone
I wanna Will Ferrell till her daddy's home
Comb through your baby hair that's the daddy duty
Wanna have a good day with your nappy roots
Tell everybody that you're your daddy's girl and daddy care
Cause daddy do and that's the truth

[Chorus x2: Moxia Raia]
What would you do if your son was at home
Crying all alone on the bedroom floor
'Cause he's hungry
And the only way to feed him is to
Sleep with a man for a little bit of money
And his daddy's gone
Somewhere smoking rock now
In and out of lock down
And I ain't got a job now
So for you this is just a good time
But for me this is what I call life
