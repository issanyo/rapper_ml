[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
We can go to London or Japan holding hands in the sand
Baby tell me what you think bout that
You can be my one I be your two, peas in a coupe
Baby tell me what you think bout that
Girl what would you say if you and I, change the seasons on the fly
Baby tell me what you think bout that
Ain't nobody tryna fall in love, girl you think too much
Baby tell me what you think

[Verse 2: Michael Anthony]
She's sore from chasing
But there's no [?] so I guess she's waiting
For me to call her back, my schedules packed
Can you imagine that?
But you can find me on the (INNANET)
But tell me what you think bout that

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
Tell me what you think, thinking or rather drinking
Pour you a mimosa and watch the momentum start sinking
Windows, binking linking my key in your ignition
Got a fit like it was written like no pen need for no inking
Gems I Jada Pinkett ring bring Will up to the Willow tree
Ass out lie your head rest it on the pillow sleep
Why don't you bring a friend make a tandem a trilogy
Three the hard way, heart beating in the hard way
You caught me looking, caught you slippin' I guess we even
I find it odd, but simultaneously intriguing
Why don't you tell me what you need? I got it
But first you gotta tell me what you think about it baby
Tell me what you...

[Verse 4: Michael Anthony and Dott Tahli]
They say cut my Dealings, fuck yo feelings
I gotta do, What  I gotta do an all, yeah
They say cut my dealings, fuck ya feelings
I gotta do, What I gotta do and all, yeah
Right before the sunlight
Hit em in the twilight
Im tell her the real.. Its [?]
Deeper than a zeitgeist
She only want the money(x11)

[Outro: Sean Deaux]
There's two joints on the hour, every hour of the day
My heart is left in pages, I got no time waste no no, no no
Every hour every minute, every second I'm awake
I'm just tryna pay my rent, tryna find my way
If it ain't no way in this world, to come easy no sir
You gotta good girl, better take that chance
You gotta good man, do the best you can
That's just real
That's just real
That's just real
That's just real
