[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
It's a shame they let us jump out of Bentleys with dirty Vans
Hit the stage for 15 minutes, get 30 bands
Swiss bank counting clean money with dirty hands
With some hood niggas that's ready to bang with the Klan
Since I came in this shit, made my name a name brand
French kissing bitches in Paris, clubbing like a caveman
We threw up the pyramids, now they say we Illuminati
Fox fur Cavalli, fuck Bill O'Reilly
No blood diamonds, I rock gold like a king
Jewelry so cold, made 'em blow the nose off the Sphinx
Fuck you think? I'ma be some type of role model?
I go full throttle desperado, that's the motto
Vic in Chicago, it's Hugh Heff at the grotto
Brazilian model, she mean mugging like Frida Kahlo
Drinking a horchata with an Alicia Machado
Bitch, I'm the ticket, you just hit the lotto

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Pullin up with the coupe
(Oh my goodness)
Must've done something with the roof
(Oh my goodness)
You sitting looking stupid on the stoop
(Oh my goodness)
I would take notes if I were you
(Oh my goodness)
This was designed with the stars, the square and the cross
So we know true north
(Oh my goodness)
Smilin', with 50 karats in my jaw
(Oh my goodness)
Fuck the law
It's a shame nigga, rhyme
Nigga, love crime

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Young Vic, the diamond's finest
I shine like Puff signed Shyne
Except I signed to the Roc 'cause I'm timeless
Top off the Masi, my behavior is mindless
Old kids, nigga, we major, you minors
Fresh out the cell to the booth, drop the Dylan Roof
I'm still in the hood, tell Zimmerman "Shoot"
Hold my nuts with an OJ glove, fuck the judge
You rappers is false flagging, you a fashion blood
What's brackin' cuz? What you know about gangbanging?
What's VLONE thug? Why Bari leave your head rangin'?
Free Vic Mensa Amistad chain swanging
This that crack music, nigga, you can blame Reagan
I'm Balmaing without paying, y'all playing
We higher than a bitch, my bitch Himalayan
Suicide Gallardo, that's the sacrificial lamb
I'm killa season Cam
No lives matter, blam

[Chorus: Pharrell]
Pullin up with the coupe
(Oh my goodness)
Must've done something with the roof
(Oh my goodness)
You sitting looking stupid on the stoop
(Oh my goodness)
I would take notes if I were you
(Oh my goodness)
This was designed with the stars, the square and the cross
So we know true north
(Oh my goodness)
Smilin', with 50 karats in my jaw
(Oh my goodness)
Fuck the law
It's a shame nigga, rhyme
Nigga, love crime

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
More money more problems, I should've learned this shit when B.I.G said it
I guess it's just my arrogance, I was being big headed
Let niggas rock the hat off my head and sleep in my crib
Politic-ing in my lawn with snakes biting in my legs
Now im stepping on their throat, I'm hoping you serpents choke
I would've never let you go broke before, now you so broke
I never sold dope, I never sold coke
But I am like olympic vaulters, gotta keep the pole close
For these vultures, when my family get an alter
Oh no
I will alter you like a tailor
Hem you up like a M seam
30 in the waist, look straight leg in these skinny jeans
Sing like Billie Jean, you dance like a thriller scene
Then moonwalk out the frame as I make my exit
Glock is my bodyguard I call it my paper-tection
Thats a safe investment, cause bullets in every turn
I'm bugging out on niggas, you just opened a can of worms
That you can't close
Who can't close
I'm not afraid of those
It's streetball rules baby, anything goes
Try to slip and slide on me, I'm shooting like Rafer Alston
Carry the Houston Rocket, the clip is taller than Yao is
I never wanted to be about gun talk
But if you start me at the races, I might let the guns off
This is just a disclaimer for anyone who wanna come for mine
I'll turn your life to bad karma when it's drama time
Put that on my Mamma i'm.....
