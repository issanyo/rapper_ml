[Verse 1]
Look, first of all, I want to thank my connect
For tellin' the world off top who got next
I'm waitin' on my chain, but still a lot on my chest
From standin' on porches to standin' on couches
I post and picture and they bitch in my outfits
I’m on my Prince shit, game, blouses
Roc fam in the buildin’ tonight
Yeah, oh, what a feelin’, I’m killin’ y’all life
I know niggas is shitty, I’m in Vegas with Diddy
But, bitch, I think I’m Diddy when I’m in my city
Or should I say Hov, that’s the CEO
A nigga come sideways and I’m at his throat
Hit the neck, then watch how the body float
You maricóns, I party on, raise a toast
It’s the Roc, I’m six-man, chase the coach
And I do say he’s been an amazin’ host
Got the Roc in the buildin’ tonight
I can stunt on y’all all, I ain’t really the type
Ay, you ain’t got to bring your purse out
Or worry ‘bout your rapper boyfriend’s whole life, that’s turned out
You know I’m in Chicago in the worst drought
Flow wet, Hov said, ‘Get your verses out’
I tap out when they figure ‘Pac murder out
Still gettin’ richer, my temperature at an all-time high
For all time, I’m aimin' past six figures
What you know about that?
Lil' nigga, that's big shit on this side
That's this side, I can’t speak on his side
My deal good, I’m overpaid like the rent high
And my rent high as fuck
How I’m gon' fall off when I’m sendin' shit up from the inside?
I could turn the rumors out
All the speculation about the dollar amount
Why I got to count? I got an accountant
From the top of the mountain to the great and gutter
What a chance, I'll be in France and they sayin' they love him
And I killed the charts in Scotland and Dublin
High off the 'Down on My Luck' shit
The fiends is flustered
You give 'em the dope, but it's hard to trust it
So many puttin' soap in the game
I came out in the rain like I got on a train
Dried me off in the hood, how I came up clean?
The game's so dirty, how I not hit a stain?
But it ain't a stain, all these Saint Laurent chains
Step on the dope, I’m killin' this white
I built what your boy couldn’t build in his life
And the Roc the construction site
I broke in the buildin', turn on the lights, we in the house
