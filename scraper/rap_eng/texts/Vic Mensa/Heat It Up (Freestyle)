[Intro]
Turn the headphones up
Hate me do the hooligan boys

[Verse 1]
Bitch we got the city on lock, I got this shit sewed up
I'm like summertime in July, I'm 'bout to heat it on up
I swear I stopped hearin' these niggas trying to shit on us
I don't respond, I'm like Ciara to that shit, so what
I was born a man and my son gon' know his father a legend
I do not fuck with these niggas, keep 'em out of my presence
All these niggas perpetrator like they not really livin'
Boy you are just the entertainer you remind us of Cedric
I'm with them knucklehead niggas and they don't like to listen

[Chorus]
Them boys gon' heat it up quick, tell them go like ignition
Go heat it up
Them boys gon' heat it up

[Verse 2]
Let me talk my shit, I'm on my own dick, no condom but it's a lifestyle
Ball hard, you a light foul, doin' this since lights out
Amnesia to my old bitches, ooh like I don't know niggas
Papers please, no swishers, far as legal fees I need four digits
Always got a judge comin' for a nigga cause I'm livin' like a hooligan
And my hood so gentrified, niggas keep the white movin' in
Like yikes, put 'em on ice
17-5 for a walkthrough, bitch I might double my price
Shout out to Young Chop and all them niggas from around my way
I swear we do not give no fuck about the shit y'all say
I'm still repping a fucking ave like my downtown days
I'm been coming for niggas heads, I's a newfound phase
Behind closed doors, niggas do not war with the kid
But shit I'm like government aid, come get that shit how you live
Truly, don't do me, I over do me, no Nudies
These Acnes on me, hurt my hip it's fucking tight as a toolie
How they accuse me plagiarizin' shit that no one has heard?
I guess that's just excuse for you to put my name in y'all words
I can't relate to y'all, y'all soundin' like a whole lot of talk
I fuck around and run up on you on a new IO Hawk
They bark loud that RARA, we do beef like Five Guys
TIDAL gang I'm HIFI, shout to Emory and Tyty
I'm ROC Nation like, "Woah Nelly," Sha money and my woe Lenny
Molly wop, nigga no Fetty, that ain't Soldier Boy with the gold tell me
Flow deadly, yeah, so deadly, heat it up, I'm 'bout to heat it up
Flexin' on her from the balcony, we what's up, my nigga, we what's up
Know these niggas got it out for me, shit I would to if I was you
See the game, get what we do, nigga free Trae not Trae tha Truth
Ain't you heard I'm jackin' beats? 2015 Ice Cube
Bonjour to the fuck niggas on Complex tryna hike views
Show out to Noah, fuck with your boy
Fuck 12 like triple four
In a Bimmer, used to whip a Ford
Jig is up, I'm 'bout to set the score

[Outro]
Heat it up, I'm 'bout to heat it up
Hah! Got him
Heat it up I got to heat it up
Flow deadly, yeah, so deadly
Flow deadly, yeah, so deadly
Heat it up, I'm 'bout to heat it up
