[Intro: Computer]
Welcome Chance, you've got mail

[Hook]
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer
Shots like Jordan, I'm sorry
I'm soarin, with these J's that I found
While in the net, surfin'
Those the same color of the last name of Gordon
But these likes that I'm scorin', are way more important
Dude I'm a Mac, what the fuck's your Dell?
Don't be mad at how my wardrobe excels
Word, lookin' for a deal how much I spend yo?
Trust me being fresh, it opens new windows
I'm always fresh and I'm always stuntin'
You're pissed cause I'm fresher than the F5 button
I'm dressed fresh, at the click of a start
After this song I'mma add a few Grammys to my cart
Woah

[Hook]
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
Hey yo I'm straight off the Netscape
Head to the internet
Log on MySpace, ask the where the women at?
I guess I'm just that type of dude
When I'm at the rest you can catch me on the web like spider food
A pair a nike shoes, nice and new
I got it cuffin' and you other niggas feet bare, like blue
Pretty girls, I keep 'em in bed like the flu
You niggas following, instead we write the rules
Sayin' Mac's 90, and infrared like Sniper 2s
Inside the booth you're recyclin'
It's proof that you dudes can't handle, like unicycles
We fantasy ballin' I'm using Michael
And I can't even call it, but if I had to choose a title
I'd say don't do me I'm an internet explorer

[Hook]
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer
