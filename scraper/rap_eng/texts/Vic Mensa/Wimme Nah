[Intro: Vic Mensa (Kami)]
If you want that
(Yo)
Hey Chukwu
(Whats good my nigga?)
If you want that
It's good my nigga, I just got back from New York
I did that XXL cover
If you want that
([?], let's go)

[Verse 1]
Hey go and get you some, that's if you want that
That check look stupid dumb, boy you better flaunt that
I'm same birds stay on the porch, ain't used to call back
And they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
If I could predict my future, I'd bet a hundred million
Pops ain't think we pick that penthouse from hangin' out front the building
Hit in the head of that Chi Town letterman on my letterman that's my business
Cause they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
Damn near feels like everyday, my nights end same time the as sunset
Brand new watch come hella late, still ain't bust and I ain't done yet
Talk that street shit cause I'm from that, before I knew tango had a knot
Boy watch how I work, I put that on the clock

[Hook]
Hey go and get you some, that's if you want that
This shit the anthem, I need a hunnid flat
I feel like Walter Payton, run that for my city now
And they wimme nah, and they wimme nah
Same shit just a different day, hol' up report back
I been smokin' strongs swear these boys do not want contact
I feel like Michael Jordan statue in my city now
Cause they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah

[Interlude]
Yeah
I got the city on my back
Niggas know I ain't gonna fall
I'mma pull up in that bitch like skkrrrr

[Verse 2]
Hey, I'm trippin' up in tight rope walkin', niggas pointin' and talkin'
When you play they pray your balance fail you just to watch you fall and
I'm still on my tippy toes, keys to my city close
Cause they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
Think work like a stripper bitch, apply it to the grip
Pivot to a euro step, hustle back
Run a play, touch a stack
Countin' purple hundreds like they counterfeit
Who be with you now? Same niggas from the rip
Clock don't stop, gotta clock this cash
Uhh, bet I knew that in the past
Look at all the bullshit I've been through
Been in this shit since '93
Runnin' like Mike back in '92 (Whoo!)
Payton in '83
Super Bowl Shuff 'til you get that ring
Pop said make it, it don't have to make you
Say you miss the old Vic, bitch me too
We was on the road, I ain't have no job
I ain't get no tick, I ain't have no watch
No whip, nope, but I had that squad
They wimme nah, run up on you like the Flintstones
You six feet down, bam, bam
Teddy bear for my jumper, you clownin'
That was the innanet, now catch me in traffic
Been at the train station, Cuba packin', paid vacation
And I stay on Woodlawn and 47th you can Google Map it
Boy they wimme nah
If you want something they'll let you have it

[Hook]

[Outro]
Yeah they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
Yeah they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
Cause they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
Yeah they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
Yeah they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
Cause they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
Yeah they wimme nah, yeah they wimme nah
(Hey! Hey!)
