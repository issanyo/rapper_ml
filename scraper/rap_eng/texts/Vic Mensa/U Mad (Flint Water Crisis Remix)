[Hook]
Ooh I don't need y'all either
Ooh don't wanna talk about it
Ooh like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody
I guess I don't (Flint let's go)
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?

[Verse]
I ain't finna sit around and let the shit ride now, wait until it all dies down
While my people being murdered, what they doing here in Flint is genocide now
We can't turn a blind eye now, and keep quiet while they kill niggas
Someone gotta pay, they might have to the governor inside the Flint River
Corporate lies, leaked emails; treating niggas like we retail
Put your life up for a price, where the keep spinning like [spring wheels?]
Try'na breath but we suffocating, lead water that's intoxicating
Don't tell me it's coincidental, they want black people depopulated
City 60 percent black, rest of them all white
If it was the other way around, they wouldn't let it ride for a single night
No questions, no questions please
Get you on your knees like Eric Garner screaming 'I can't breathe'
The police kill you for a cigarette, I guess it's worth more than a life
So we blacking out on Oscar night because you know the Oscars is so white
Don't ask me why I'm mad, bitch I'm enraged
Who? Me? They should know my name

[Hook]
Ooh I don't need y'all either
Ooh don't wanna talk about it
Ooh like I don't know nobody
Like I don't know nobody
I guess I don't (Flint let's go)
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
Oh you mad, huh?
