[Intro]
"...Fuck you and fuck your mama, fuck your family
Fuck everybody that care about you
Fuck your whole life, goodbye"
Hooligans
Back the fuck up

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy
Get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy (Yeah!)
Fuck up the street! (Fuck it up)

I'm rowdy, we rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy
Get rowdy, get rowdy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get rowdy, get rowdy
I walk in the spot I don't dance (Uh)

Call up the gang and they mash (Uh)
Call up the gang and they mash (Woo!)

[Verse 1: Vic Mensa]
Gang, gang in this shit, let me make an introduction
Bitch, yo' face can meet my fist (Fight me then!)
Fuck a fight, I keep my gliz, I'm on 53 where Nikko live
Ain't got no son that's on my kids (Hooligans)
SaveMoney still alive, nigga
Still bangin' on the 6 and on the 5, nigga
Who wanna slide, nigga? (Where you at?)
On 47th, that's what we reppin', fuck the number after 11
Bitch, I been with Joey Purp and gang, gang since '07
I don't say names, niggas steady gangbang
Boy you need a ref, you false flagging
And I can't get caught lacking, I'm about that pole action
I keep that strap on me, and my Girbauds saggin'

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy
Get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy (Yeah!)
Fuck up the street! (Fuck it up)

Get rowdy, get rowdy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get rowdy, get rowdy
I walk in the spot I don't dance (Uh)

[Verse 2: G Herbo]
Rowdy, we rowdy
No limit I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Gang, gang, every day I shout it
A nigga house, we be outside it
2015, we was sliding, we sliding
Fuck it, nobody outside over here
Might as well go slide on the fire then
Let me bail out on my side then
Spin the block twice, they hiding
Make sure the kids get safe to school
So we pop out like 9, 10
And we back out on the nine again
Whole lot of drink, not the Heineken
I just got a brand new fin
Wet his shirt up, he trying to swim
Used to repent and sin again
Buy a new whip, get a dent again
Used to go to dinner, eat in
I was like, "You must want Wendy's again?"
Stacking it down to the pennies, I am
I want to buy a Lamb', Asiatic, I retire him

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
Get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy
Get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy (Yeah!)
Fuck up the street! (Fuck it up)
Run up, tweak (Run it up)
Call up police (Police ass)
The problem is me! (Problem is me)
I'm rowdy, we rowdy, get rowdy, get rowdy
Get rowdy, get rowdy (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Get rowdy, get rowdy
I walk in the spot I don't dance (Uh)
I got my Glock in my pants (Uhh)
Call up the gang and they mash (Uh)
Call up the gang and they mash
SaveMoney Still Alive

[Outro: Korporate]
"Aye, why you be tryin' to send it up wit' everybody, bro?
Fuck, motherfuckers on that! Ain't no one-on-ones, bitch!"
