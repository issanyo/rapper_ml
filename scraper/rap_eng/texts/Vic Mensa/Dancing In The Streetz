[Intro]
I felt free
I felt absolutely free
I had the freedom in me
I mean, I was making my own moves
Understand?
Hooligans

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
They gon' be dancin' in the streets
Dancin' in the streets
Ali Bomaye, ayy
Ali Bomaye, ayy
We gon' be dancin' in the streets
Belly of the beast
On some Ali Bomaye, ayy
I ain't one to play, uh

[Verse: Vic Mensa]
Inside the schizophrenic mind, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Fly
If the law don't kill me first, the doors commit suicide
They gon' shoot me if I don't or if I do comply
Least I'll die a black messiah even if I'm crucified
Streets is in a uproar, police is at your front door
Left 'em full of holes, you'd have thought it was Connect 4
Soo woo, red all over, it's white F4s
Standin' there wishin' I cared more
Whippin' a Maserati on Hollywood, speedin', dodgin' my demons
TMZ and the paparazzi tweakin', dyin' to see 'em
"Who inside that? Only a rock star could drive that"
Switch lanes on 'em, let me not get sidetracked
Slide back to the block where the guys at
Rob you for your Jordans and your soul get hijacked
The same block where niggas shot dice and died at
And mothers cried at, that's where we ride at

[Chorus: Vic Mensa]
They gon' be dancin' in the streets
Dancin' in the streets
Ali Bomaye, ayy
Ali Bomaye, ayy
We gon' be dancin' in the streets
Belly of the beast
On some Ali Bomaye, ayy
I ain't one to play, uh

[Outro: Jesse Rutherford]
What happens when a caveman of madness
And adds some gravity onto his soul?
Trapped inside a maze you can't imagine
Wonder if it's all worth living for
I gotta break out, (Hey!) break out
Break out, yeah, uh
I gotta break out, oh, break out
I don't wanna break down (No!)
