[Verse 1]
Shoulda lost your number long ago, but I never did
Had a gig at a shop I used to live above
Pretty eyes and electric smile that’ll put you in shock
Make everything stop, call me when you off the restaurant

[Hook]
Ridin’ round, gettin’ high, like it’s 1999
Nothin’s wrong and nothin’s right
Ridin’ round, gettin’ high, shakedown 1999
Nothin’s wrong and nothin’s right
Ooh, you think that you love someone, just see where it goes
Long as I can watch you walk away
Ooh, you think that I know, you know
Let's keep it easy, baby, there’s no need to complicate

[Verse 2]
Cigarettes and rosy right around her tips
Love the way she pouts her lips
Blows a kiss when she puts her makeup on
Took a trip out to Los Angeles
At the beach I lost my phone, it’s cool
As long as I found your favourite song
We could go for a day ride in the daylight
In a minute then I know I’ll be away
And I’ve been thinkin’ of you
And I don’t know if the day will come
When I fall, but I hope it’s for you

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We could be rollin’, we could be ridin’
No suicidin
We could be rollin’, we could be ridin’
Just me and my baby
We could be rollin’, we could be ridin’
No suicidin
We could be rollin’, we could be ridin’
Just me and my baby

[Hook]
