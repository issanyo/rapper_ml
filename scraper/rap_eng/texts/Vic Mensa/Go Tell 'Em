[Sample]
Go tell em, go tell em
Go tell em, go tell em
Go tell em, go tell em

[Verse 1]
Go tell em, I’m gon' tell what they don't tell 'em
We been under water since they threw us in the boat
Sellin cotton pickin’ blues
Rock and roll, railroad buildin'
Serving white America before we was dope dealing
Brick laid the birth of a nation, it’s the Roc
White house, black man, plantation, it’s Barack
But we still can’t cross the street
Without the cops trynna Zimmerman us while the whole neighborhood watch
They chained us to the auction block but now we changin’ the locks
‘Cause even Bill O’Reilly daughter out here drinkin’ Ciroc
Now that’s what I call the 21st Century Fox
Where Megyn Kelly try to tell me Santa’s white
It's in town
Murder us right?
I just remember rap stars the new Bach
I pull strings like the orchestra, shut down your corporate
Nat Turner
Run up in the doors to your Nordstrom with a hundred niggas ready
And a hundred thousand more for ya

[Hook]
I see the future Martin Luther dreamt when he was a man
I feel the blood my momma fought for
See the scars on her hands
Go tell em that it ain’t no looking back now
Oh lord, as far as I ran
So take these chains or give me death
Either way we coming again

[Sample]
Go tell em, go tell em
Go tell em, go tell em
Go tell em, go tell em

[Verse 2]
Stripped from the family
Ripped from reality
Belly of the beast to the grips of the tragedy
Couldn't touch my soul so they whipped my anatomy
I re-wrote the script when they thought they had mastered me
1-2-3
Now I'm counting up the casualties
Mounting up the calvary
Riding with a master piece
Shotgun shells show you god when they blast for me
Running like a wolf when they send the dogs after me
Fighting for my freedom, yes I had the audacity
Hangin' from the trees, black blood on the leaves
Jumping overboard, black bodies in the sea
I die on my feet 'fore I live on my knees
So you know I'm not begging if I say "Nigga please"

[Hook]
I see the future Martin Luther dreamt when he was a man
I feel the blood my momma fought for
See the scars on her hands
Go tell em that it ain’t no looking back now
Oh lord as far as I ran
So take these chains or give me death
Either way we coming again
