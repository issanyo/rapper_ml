Hey
And we gon' do it just like the movies
Lines on the table and I'm fuckin mor groupies, hey
And this shit sound just like 80s Miami
My feet outside the sunroof bald fade on the Caddy, hey
I'm good I feel like Ray Liotta
In that black and white old school it look like Sammy Sosa yeah
Stunt like the matrix reloaded
Yeah I'm right back on this action like the matrix reloaded
I spent the cash and then I had to recoup it
Overseas and my broads all different color of groupies
Trying to make a hit I make a black and white movie
Stuntman forever hopping out of the roof and
Emerging, I splurge just to give you some proof
I spent some Christian Bales on some vintage Chanel off a move
All white jewels, all the white jewels, can't feel my tooth
Brought it right back on niggas just like it was part two
Pour some Sprite in the cup, call the cup act two
Drank the whole damn thing that's what the script said to do
It's some real life movie shit based on truth
And you know how we coming baby just like the movies

[Verse 2: Towkio]
Who got that script who got that sip
I'm tryin to drink some
Hammer staring down the barrel like I'm Clint Eastwood
Step up to the balcony I'm going out shootin
And they gon' have to kill me dead it's some fucking house shoes
I'm allergic to the phony I put it on Tony
Yeah the world is yours world is yours that's what he told me (it's mine]
I'm directing and I'm stuntin and I'm starting to score 'n (action)
Have your bitch bring the action and we startin the orgy yeah
And then you gon' die with me
Yeah I'm close to the blood I'm a Guy like Ritchie
I stop the Madonna with Teen Spirit like Nirvana
That could do magic, she had a whole rock in her nostril, damn
Takin' that pill, feel like young Lil'
I get to sinking they ship, tell them save themselves
I mean I can't forget, seen it fresh off Kiwi

[Verse 3: Vic Mensa]
Rockstar
Just like the movies
Unroll the red carpet for the most controversial provacative verses
Diamond in the rough, that's just scratching the surface
Spit fire Cirque du Soleil, my life is a circus, give you my soul for purchase
Out the war zone it birthed us
Better known as Chiraq, I survived that
Left me with more emotional baggage than a sky cap
Paranoia out in California toting my strap
When you this fly niggas wanna hijack
Ball like '09 Steph
Came in as a underdog
Everone's a critic now
Life of a movie star
Niggas wanna hit me I'm just dodging them, I'm supercharged
You retards thinking you gon' knock me off my spot
Knock it off
I'm a boss, bitch, I do boss shit
Gotta die with money 'cause a nigga wasn't born rich
Changing clothes three times the only way I forfeit
I won't stop til I'm on Forbes list
Money never made me but maybe it made me crazy
To the point my close friends think these labels startin' to change me
Like bein' with Blake Z means I won't I Roc-A-Fella
Niggas took the jersey off
I thought we would die together
It hurt to watch
Kami and Purp my dogs
From the dirt to the yard
I would live in chains for y'all to reverse the charge
Save Money on a blimp, the world is ours
My life in black and white
Film Noir

[Hook: Joey Purp]
Yeah
And we gon do it just like the movies yeah
Fast cars fast bitches bottles and groupies hey
And we gon' do it just like the movies yeah
Fast cars fast bitches bottles and groupies yeah
