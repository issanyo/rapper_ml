[Hook]
We the motherfucking fear
We the motherfucking fear
We the motherfucking fear
Gunshots in the air
Gunshots in the air
Gunshots in the air

Verse 1:
No cause for alarm, just tell them we on
I'm busting all black for young niggas we mourn
Got coco on the key, nose for the debris
Worry about yourself, don't worry about me
Cause God doesn't exist, least that's the way we live round here
I'm just tryna be the champion I mean
Niggas came on a ship, told them to take a trip round here
Enemies hang them dead on arrival
Niggas figure survival
Man I mean you gotta be with this shit
SAVEMONEY: And my niggas are savages
I don't give a fuck about all your establishments
I don't know to cope with the fake, I ain't having it
Niggas talk out loud, I just smoke out loud
[?]
I'll let you niggas have fun, I'm a go hard now
Either that or go home to

[Hook]
We the motherfucking fear
We the motherfucking fear
We the motherfucking fear
Gunshots in the air
Gunshots in the air
Gunshots in the air

[Verse 2]
Niggas shooting in the parking lot
They don't give a fuck if it's dark or not
Daytime [?] Niggas down to catch a murder
It's some shit you never heard of
I'll take you to Chicago now where everywhere I go
Niggas falling into the street like potholes
