[Hook]
Everybody, we got the jazz and we got the facts
Get ready, let's get it started
We got the jazz and we got the facts
Everybody, we got the jazz and we got the facts
Get ready, let's get it started
We got the jazz and we got the facts

[Verse 1]
쟤 이름은 Shimmy Twice, 성격은 nice
멋을 아는 여성들이 좋아할 타입
You can ask for a ride but never cross lines
아주 아쉽게도 그는 품절남
When he kicks.. when he hits the snare
And when he does a little bit of cut and paste
팬이라면 듣고 나선 maniac, MC라면 듣고나서, um, yeah
내 이름은 Zino, he knows and she knows, 2010년 featuring 1호
Swings, The Quiett, Dok2 또 King of Flow, 화요비, 기석이와 민호
Fuck that liquars, 술이 너무 싫어, 술자리가면 나는 매일 길을 잃어
술을 권한 여자들은 내 일기를 읽고, say a-ha, 내게 먹히는건 cigar

[Hook]
Everybody, we got the jazz and we got the facts
Get ready, let's get it started
We got the jazz and we got the facts
Everybody, we got the jazz and we got the facts
Get ready, let's get it started
We got the jazz and we got the facts

[Verse 2]
Uh, we call'em Jazzyfact, 모든 신사들과 숙녀들은 wave yo hands
Holla at ya boys, hey, let's be friends, hut1, hut2, hut, yes, we can
Come and shake yo hands and your body too
뚱뚱한 여자들의 무다리도
옆집 아줌마가 말했지 '살리고'
그녀의 남편은 말해 'i'm in love with you'
빨리 말해줘 친구들에게 'no doubt, it's cool, just press play'
이야기를 듣고 너의 삶에 대입해, 고3은 놀땐 놀며 대입해
Baby, 걱정은 내일해, 남자라면 특히 더 that's gay thang
너가 gay라면 girl, i can understand
Keep yo head up all the lesbians

[Hook]
Everybody, we got the jazz and we got the facts
Get ready, let's get it started
We got the jazz and we got the facts
Everybody, we got the jazz and we got the facts
Get ready, let's get it started
We got the jazz and we got the facts
