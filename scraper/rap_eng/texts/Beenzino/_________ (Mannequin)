Korean Original

[Verse 1: Suran]
햇살 눈 부신 가로수길
넌 모두의 눈길을 훔친 lady 넌 완벽해
긴 다리 잘록한 니 허리 질투를 부르는
새까만 눈이 so chic 넌 조금 도도해

[Pre-Chorus 1: Suran]
One two step for what?
니가 지나간 이 길은 runway 같아
내 남자의 눈도 니 뒤를 쫓는걸 난 잠시 잊혀진 듯 해

[Chorus: Suran]
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
너를 원해 What's your style?
Follow follow you 따라 해 모든걸 널 원해
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
뻔한 미소까지도 모두가 원하는 걸

[Verse 2: Beenzino]
넌 너무 마네퀸같아 데이트를 할 때는
200만원을 2분 안에 지불하게 하네
I go broke, but girl I'm ok with it
그래야만 너는 만족해
My money and the fame, 너는 그런 걸 원해
난 그런 널 원해서 널 유명하게 하네
I’m in trouble, but girl I'm ok with it
난 만족해 네 몸매와 네 얼굴에

[Verse 3: Suran]
넌 마치 display 된 마네퀸 값비싼 새 옷들
Money queen 근데 넌 왜? 향기가 없는 꽃
넌 너무 트렌디해 잘 입힌 마네퀸 너도 나도 핫
립스틱 똑같이 왜? 아이아이러니해

[Pre-Chorus 2: Suran]
One two step for what? 니가 지나간 이 길은 runway 같아
이 순간 내 눈도 니 뒤를 쫓는 걸 난 잠시 뒤쳐진 듯 해

[Chorus: Suran]
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
너를 원해 What's your style?
Follow follow you 따라 해 모든걸 널 원해
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
뻔한 미소까지도 모두가 원하는 걸

[Verse 4: Suran]
One two three, so many on the street
Four five six 넌 마네퀸
Just walking down the street
Chic하게 화보같이
이 거리 저 거리 many on the street
서로를 꼭 닮은 넌 마네퀸
마치 어디서 본 것 같지
첨인데 왜 왜 왜 왜?

[Chorus: Suran]
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
너를 원해 What's your style?
Follow follow you 따라 해 모든걸 널 원해
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
뻔한 미소까지도 모두가 원하는 걸

English Translation

[Verse 1: Suran]
The sunny and dazzling Garosugil
Everyone's eyes are on you, lady, you're perfect
Long legs, thin waist, your black eyes cause jealousy
So chic, you’re a little bit elegant

[Pre-Chorus 1: Suran]
One two step for what?
This road is like a runway when you walk by
Forgetting me, even my man's eyes follow you

[Chorus: Suran]
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
I want you, what’s your style?
Follow follow you, follow you in everything, I want you
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
Even your predictable smile is desired by everyone

[Verse 2: Beenzino]
You’re too much like a mannequin, when we're on a date
You make me spend 2 grand in 2 minutes
I go broke, but girl I'm ok with it
That’s the only way you’re satisfied
My money and the fame, that's what you want
But I want you so I’m making you famous
I’m in trouble, but girl I'm ok with it
I’m satisfied with your body and your face

[Verse 3: Suran]
You're like a mannequin on display in expensive new clothes
Money queen, but why are you like a scentless flower?
You're too trendy, a well dressed mannequin
You and me wear the same hot lipstick, but why is it ironic?

[Pre-Chorus 2: Suran]
One two step for what?
This road is like a runway when you walk by
Even my eyes follow you, like I’m lagging behind for a moment

[Chorus: Suran]
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
I want you, what’s your style?
Follow follow you, follow you in everything, I want you
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
Even your predictable smile is desired by everyone

[Verse 4: Suran]
One two three so many on the street
Four five six, you’re a mannequin
Just walking down the street
So chic, like a photo shoot
This street, that street, many on the street
You're a mannequin everyone else resembles
As if I’ve seen you somewhere
Though we've never met before, why why why why

[Chorus: Suran]
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
I want you, what’s your style?
Follow follow you, follow you in everything, I want you
Manne-mannequin, money-money queen
Even your predictable smile is desired by everyone
