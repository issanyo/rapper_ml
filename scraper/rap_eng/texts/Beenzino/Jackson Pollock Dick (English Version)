I like the color of your skin
You're the one that I dreamed, girl
And I wonder if it's pink
I wonder if it is Brazilian
난 알고 싶어, deeper you. 365 think of you
I picture you. 난 남기 싫어, 그냥 친구론
I just wanna lick you good on my 침구류
Yeah, in my bed. Let me paint you like how Jackson Pollock did

Miami heat. Can I hit you in the morning?
I bet you never seen the fireworks in the morning
Yeah, I'mma be that fire, you can be my gasolina
Fuck the fashion. Let's get naked. I just want the passion-ista
And in this situation에서 Asian rapper ain't polite
Yes, let me paint you like how Jackson Pollock did
