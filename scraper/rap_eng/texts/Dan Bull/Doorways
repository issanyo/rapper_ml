[Verse 1]
My first heartbeat; life starts sweet
I'm a part of her and she's a part of me
I can't believe these feelings I'm feeling
It hardly seems real - I'm dreaming
Me being a being, breathing
A beacon beamed in by the beat of birth
A seed, a sperm, I leave in search
I need to fertilise so I can be with the world
The bees and the birds, trees and the herbs
Even the Earth and the people, I need to immerse
The first physical feelings seep through my nerves
Pins and needles tingle deep and it hurts
But it's worth it as I creep to my birth
To be with the legions of unique creatures on Earth
I'll treasure each thing I learn
And teach it to others in turn
Now I'm a good person

[Hook]
I'm safe in this womb
A place in which wounds won't do no harm
I'm safe in this womb
A place in which wounds won't do no harm
I'm safe in this womb

[Verse 2]
An old man, with my whole family
Standing around me holding my hand
I'm cold and even beneath the folds of my blanket
The heat seeps from me; I'm freezing
I'm wheezing, my breathing's increasingly weak
And the people with me seem to be fleeting
But it's me that's leaving - I need to
I need to be at peace soon
I see through the veil
The innate truth that humans fail to value til it's too late
Choose fate, lose waking consciousness
And at once succumb to a new state of mind
Where space and time, they combine, entwine
And you face the universal I
Are you the first to die? No
But I know that it's finally my time to go

[Outro]
I'm safe in this room
A place in which wounds won't do no harm
I'm safe in this room
A place in which wounds won't do no harm
I'm safe in this room
