[Verse 1]
Once upon a time there was a working class hero
Who wanted to give power to the people so
He asked us to imagine a world of peace,love and truth
To give peace a chance,
Do you want to know a secret from me to you?
All you need is love so love me do
And whether the music was acoustic or rock and roll
He walked the long and winding road 'till he wore out his rubber sole
With his old brown shoe
He broke walls and bridges down
Made us come together
'Caused us all to twist and shout
He was the one to tell us what goes on
Number nine, number nine revolution

John
Le-le-le-le-le-le-le-lennon
John
Oh, john
Le-le-le-le-le-le-le-lennon

[Verse 2]
He was a paperback writer
As well as pen and verse
His best known publication was a spaniard in the works
And in his own right
He would write and write and write
Cause you should do whatever gets you through the night
Every man has a woman who loves him more than any other
But for this boy,who'd compare to john lennons mother?
She's a woman named yoko
She's something new
So hold on john, because she loves you
This is real love
No more cover versions
Their love was just like starting over,two virgins
He was happier then anybody'd ever seen
But the boys at abbey road,didn't want to let it be

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
He went to live in new york city,but he lived on borrowed time
Living life with the lines,he was shot by a jealous guy
With a revolver,but don't ask me why
Life's little more then: Hello, goodbye
My, what a souvenir from their visit to america
Now hes going to strawberry fields forever
Hardly instant karma, but
Calm your nerves
Cause this beautiful boy's now as free as a bird

[Hook x2]
