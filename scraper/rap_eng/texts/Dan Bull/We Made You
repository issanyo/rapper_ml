[Chorus]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they ignore, and it's painful to see (such a shame to see)
You're a wannabe (baby)
Nobody wants you (nobody wants you)
Danny Boy, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

[Verse 1]
Slim Shady's been making
The same gimmicky single ever since his debut
And Doctor Dre? God you've aged
Have you not been replaced yet? Watch this space
It's Dan Bull and I'm on the case
Heckling the a-list like the gossip pages
And now Lady Sov's washed her face
And looks vaguely posh, she's maybe hot to date
I should maybe stop taking pops
In case the cops come and raid my place unwarranted;
I mean they came in Damien Green's office
Having not asked Jacquie Smith
What would she say if Ian Tomlinson asked if
The police state actually exists?
It's okay cos she's Happy with a Saturday in
A pack of tissues and some tacky vids

[Chorus]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they ignore, and it's painful to see (such a shame to see)
You're a wannabe (baby)
Nobody wants you (nobody wants you)
Danny Boy, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

[Verse 2]
You'll need the hospital
When you read the cost that the arena wants off you
To see the paed... er, king of pop
Can we believe that Johnson'll be responsible
When he's previously offered to beat up on someone?
Once up on a time, we were sensible;
Would choose an MP whose policies were credible
But the time Brown went to the White House
His friend Mister President sent him on time out
Man I'd love to hire out Alan Sugar right now
Just so I could tell him "Look, you're fired, out!"
I would pass the buck to Captain Crunch
But I've had enough financial advice now
Hasn't The Sun enough to lie about
Without another patronising accountant flying round?
'Cause our darling Alistair cried out
Times ahead are as dark as the black of his eyebrows

[Chorus]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they ignore, and it's painful to see (such a shame to see)
You're a wannabe (baby)
Nobody wants you (nobody wants you)
Danny Boy, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you

[Verse 3]
This is a promotional track for my album
And it isn't relevant but you should check it out
And if you want you can give me money too
Come on and help to give the world economy a boost

Has no-one ever told Cheryl Cole she could never hold a note
Let alone tell whether someone else is better?
Oh yeah - by the way, Simon's waistline
Is way higher than Jade's final age
I shouldn't have made that statement
Because if the papers are to be believed she's an angel
Forget the race issues, they were yesterday's news
And today sales are huge
Madonna's a media concoction too:
If she's Jesus' mom, why the need for adoption?
Madge, aren't you getting on a bit? You're like fifty
No wonder you got ditched by Guy Ritchie
Nah, you're alright, still - oh, Hi Lily
How's your guy, is there still life in his willy?
I feel silly, 'cause I like you all really
Sorry everyone, I want a bit of nice publicity

[Chorus]
When you walked through the door
It was clear to me (clear to me)
You're the one they ignore, and it's painful to see (such a shame to see)
You're a wannabe (baby)
Nobody wants you (nobody wants you)
Danny Boy, who can really blame you (who can really blame you)
We're the ones who made you
