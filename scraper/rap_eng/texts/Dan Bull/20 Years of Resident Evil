[Verse 1]
There's funny stuff happening in the Arklay mountains
Far fetched, but when you see the proof, you can hardly doubt it
People acting animalistic
Cannibalistic
Bravo Team went in with a bag of ballistics and now they're missing
Now Alpha Team need to find them and to bring them back
Good job, we brought some sniffer dogs
Oh no, we're being attacked
Crap, they want to eat us
A tactical retreat into this mansion
Will prevent us all from landing up as meat
Now we can meet the team
Barry, Chris, Wesker, and Jill
Whos destiny's to fulfill a plethora of exceptional kills
It's best to be the best of the best in the business
Because there's resident undead and your head's on their hit list
Sick hominy grits
This zombie's a bitch
And he kinda looks like the ex head of Abercrombie and Fitch
We've lost communications
Contact the letting agent
This mansion's in urgent need of heavy renovation
Bits of lead are penetrating every wall I'm facing
I see through the heavy rain into Umbrella Corporation
They're creating a mutagenic agent named T-virus
I see, that explains the stage displays of Miley Cyrus
We mustn't let it spread and affect the rest of us
Nobody wants that
Except evidently Wesker does
He's treacherous
Messed with us
The complex is set to bust
We'd best get the bus
Before the blast combusts our flesh to dust

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

[Verse 2]
Now rewind twenty four hours in time
So we can see what Alpha Team was sent into the deepest night to find
Bravo Team left the chopper crash site
To get on with their proper pastime
Pretty much like last time
Let me introduce Rebecca Chambers
A chick who steps on trains
Regardless of whether she's in hecka danger
Seems she bought the wrong ticket
This could be a long trip
But where she's going, she's got a cell mate, a convict
Billy Coen
It's like Con Air, but on rails
Smashing barriers like record day one sales
Strong gales fail to derail their aim from it's target
To unveil and excavate the fate of James Marcus
From train rides to strange tidings sane minds
Can take down an umbrella under daylight
From train rides to strange tidings sane minds
Can take down an umbrella under daylight

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

[Verse 3]
Two months have passed after the blast
And from the debris zombies are free
Lucky we brung in a rookie from the police
Enter Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield
A rare pair whose enemies will be left with heads peeled
This is not a nightmare, Claire, it's dead real
And the remedy's a red hot shot of lead
Pew!
This lady played along
Her name is Ada Wong
She came to take the G-virus
And her infiltration game is strong
But it's in the hands of an urchin called Sherry Birkin
Who's under threat of hurting from every enemy lurking
So it's time to make a break and face her great big dad
Take a train away to safety and escape the flaming lab

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

[Verse 4]
Elsewhere in the hell of Raccoon City
Jill Valentine's back for a task that's not to pretty
She's here to prove the conspiracy regarding Umbrella
But it's too late, she needs to escape with Carlos Oliviera
They wrangle with foes and the most vicious of attacks
And untangle a plan to blow the city off the map
And whenever there's a terrorist
Better get off of the premises
Ever so quick
No menace is relentless as Nemesis is
God damn, this is hella cocked up
Where the hell's the helicopter?
Get a flare up in the air
A better fare just went and rocked up
Hop in
Who the hell's that hairy fellow dwelling in the cockpit
Now watch the bomb hit and demolish the metropolis

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

[Verse 5]
Now after all the commotion
Leon was forwarded for a promotion
To withdraw the daughter of POTUS
From the claws of an occult cult over the ocean
At home in Europa
And I can only assume soon their bones will be broken
Hmm, that's strange
Now either we've played the wrong track
Or we may have got our facts wrong and now Ada Wong's back
She's playing the game like ong-bak on a recovery mission
To retrieve a plague that'll leave you needing the recovery position
A vicious parasite know as Plaga
Used as a recruitment tool by Los Illuminados
Leon gets the virus like the toolbar on a crap browser
And at the same time he has to fight his mate Jack Krauser
On a secret island where they find a device
To defeat the virus like the most minor of lice
Until surprise, surprise, a final violent fight, a tyrant dies
They ski and see the island's fiery demise

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away

[Verse 6]
Flash to Chris Redfield, five years after that
He met Sheva Alomar on dispatch to Africa
She went back to tackle disasters
That happened in the aftermath
Of Umbrella's dastardly plans
Sacrificial lambs
Tasked with apprehending a man to prevent a bio-organic weapon
From hitting the black market and spreading
They head in ever deeper, this region's like hell
No surprise Wesker's scheming behind the scenes at Tricell
He and Excella are keen to accelerate the dissemination
Of a cellular agent with the aim of complete devastation
Chris and Sheva kill Excella, deal with Wesker
Then escape in a helicopter, they couldn't have did it better

[Chorus]
And I think of all the things that we've survived
So giving up has been out of conversation
My team and I fought through the blood loss
Chemical in your face and a shotgun
As you die
You'll see us ride away
