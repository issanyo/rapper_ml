[Verse 1]
Me? I'm Horny, short for the Horned Reaper
I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper
Unbelievers better take a step back
Because I set traps till they leave your necks snapped
Forget a pimp slap switch up the syntax
Take away the P, see I deliver Imp Slaps
There's a slim chance that you've ever seen an enemy
With melanin as red as this; the menacingest skin rash
Better bring your shin pads
Cause when I swing axes
There's an equal need for medicine and bin bags

[Chorus]
I'm Horny, short for the Horned Reaper
I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper
(x2)

[Verse 2]
You ought to have taken a tad more care
With your fortification 'cause that wall there's
Gonna fall and then cave in, I'll nab your lair
You'll be sore as the day when I stabbed your bare bottom
And in case you've forgotten
I hail from a place that is fatally rotten
So debased I can make even Satan pee off
And I must say that is painfully often
Your safe, I'm unlockin', knicking your millions
Sticking your minions straight in a coffin
I plunge in to your dungeon, lungin' through your little buggers
Like I'm cuttin' through an onion
Under ye' foot, plunder ye' loot
Funneling your funds to me, can you compute?
The heart of your dungeons the dungeon heart
I'm taking pleasure, breaking it and pulling it apart
Then take your treasure, claiming it, as bullion in carts
Now you see red, I'm the bully in the dark

[Chorus]
I'm horny, short for the Horned Reaper
I'm chums with the Dungeon Keeper (x2)

[Outro]
The hand of evil strikes again!
