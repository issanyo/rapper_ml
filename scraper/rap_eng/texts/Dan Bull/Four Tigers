[Verse 1]
It's Terry Bull
Necking bevies 'til my belly's very full
I let it all hang out
Innit incredible?
This ain't a sports tournament
It's a festival
To see how many people we can turn into vegetables
It's not a game
For me it's something sexual
I've never kicked a ball
Except for some testicles
So I hope you know a medical professional
'Cause I'm looking for somebody to deck, and you're eligible
A dodgy fucker, call me Terry Venables
I put an end to more bloody cunts than the [? 0:28]
Wrecking your heart
No, not a chance
I'll break you down like Chrouchies' robot dance

[Chorus]
England, England
Come on England
E-N-G... L... A, oh
G... L... A...
E-England!

[Verse 2]
Oi
Be quiet, never mind three lions on my shirt
I've got four tigers and a bottle opener
I'm hoping that this year we'll be lucky
But I know we won't really, so I bet against us at the bookies
And if I win, I spend it all on beer
It costs lots of dosh to get hammered, that's [? 0:59]
Every four years I brought beers
And supported my sporting peers with roars and cheers
Even Gazza couldn't cry more tears
When the other side score
I'm like "Oh dear!"
When the game's on Radio 5, you'll see
I'm like Wayne Rooney's face, I'm all ears

[Chorus]
England, England
Come on England
E-N-G... L... A, oh
G... L... A...
E-England!

[Verse 3]
We're from the place where the players play in shirts and skin
It's taking part that counts, but it wouldn't hurt to win
But when we talk about shirts and skins
We mean skinheads, Ben Sherman shirts and [? 1:35]
Balls are gonna get swiftly kicked
Right back to 1966
Although I don't condone hooliganism
Because I'm every single finger [? 1:45]
Listen, I'm an Englishman, I drink tea and eat crumpets
But when I see a foreigners' face, I have to thump it
British brawlers are broader than drunkeds
So you'll get kicked more than the big bit on a drum kit

[Chorus]
England, England
Come on England
E-N-G... L... A, oh
G... L... A...
E-England!

[Verse 4]
Get me some [? 2:07] and a couple of [? 2:08]
Then let's go hunting for the huns in the [Argies? 2:11]
[Barmearme, barmearme? 2:12]
We're forty folks with bigger tummies than a bloody dance team
George Best, Bobby Charlton, Jimmy Greaves
We've had some flippin' wicked in the English leagues
John Terry, Gareth Barry, Leighton Baines
Aaron Lennon, [? 2:26], David James
Ashley and Joe Cole, Glen and Adam Johnson
Think we haven't got a chance?
Then you're chatting nonsense
From Carrick to [Carriger? 2:33], we're gonna carry the flag
Down to South Africa, we fracking batter ya

[Chorus]
England, England
Come on England
E-N-G... L... A, oh
G... L... A...
E-England!
