[Intro]
Your attention, please

[Verse 1]
When life is blurring you to blindness
Slide the curtain to the side
Move in strides into the light
Observe the views and sights
The dirty beauty oozing through the market
Hurts and soothes your eyes
Are you excited to be starting?
Scuse me, who's this guy?
Hell if I'm sure, but if he's buying
Hell or high water, it'll be mine
And this is my calling; Meaning of life
I live or die for achieving the prize
This is my fort
This is my wall
If you stick inside well it isn't my fault
Your survival here is relying on freelancers like I am
And this is my world

[Hook]
Gloomy safety
Or beautiful danger
The daily mundane streets
Or brutal nature
Be one of the few
That's brave enough
To choose your fate, bruh
Be one of the few
That makes opportunities
And moves the stakes up

Are you a consumer
Or are you a creator
Are you a producer
Or are you a potato
Be one of the few today
To use your labour to your favor
Be one of the few
Generating greater boons to human nature

[Verse 2]
To leave the fort you need the balls
Proceed to leap from the big wall
Skydive from a highrise
To environments I've never seen before
What the heck happened to Chester Zoo?
The recent recession has wrecked it
Boo
I suggest that it's best to choose
To have a companion next to you
We travel in javelin exosuits
Can't imagine a man that is dressed so cute
Just looking and smelling as fresh as I do
Is essentially sex abuse
Pew Pew!
Forget having one jet, there's two
And another mini set per shoe
'Cause if you messed up the letters in "boots"
You get to "boost"
Yes you do
Now I'm ready for fresh pursuits
More than another quest to fetch the loot
I've come to collect my dues
Your debts are due
And I couldn't be less interested
In your next excuse
Or whether you're destitute
Bereft and stressed as fuque
My intention's to execute
Every threat that's looming
Boom!
Yes my dude

[Hook]
Gloomy safety
Or beautiful danger
The daily mundane streets
Or brutal nature
Be one of the few
That's brave enough
To choose your fate, bruh
Be one of the few
That makes opportunities
And moves the stakes up

Are you a consumer
Or are you a creator
Are you a producer
Or are you a potato
Be one of the few today
To use your labour to your favor
Be one of the few
Generating greater boons to human nature

[Verse 3]
I can feel the mist, steal a kiss
Fill my chest and chill my breath
Like menthol filter tips
But when my mental skills are tested
Will's unaffected
I've spilled a river of ichor
Lost track of my kills, assists and deaths
Can't measure the pulses I've stilled in this
Wilderness
But I will persist
Until I've fixed and healed the rifts
That still exist, fulfil your wish
Yes, there isn't a lyricist
That's nearing this, so deal with it

A brilliant artist
Getting plenty of Brynnium shards
To bring them to Tarsus
Killing more Scars in shimmering darkness
As if they really were harmless
I'm not hanging back
Stop a Scar attack on my habitat
What a savage act
Flukin have it twat
Dropping Jarra's Wrath
Bruv, I'm grabbing that
They won't have it back
I can adapt
To the situation which we're facing
Just be patient
Swimming through ancient misty caves
In distant places
This is amazing
Quit the switching and changing, stick to your lane
Stay true to the program
Or feel a new definition of pain
Crushed in your suit like an aluminum coke can
Heed the danger warning
It's real, we are not play performing
By the way, say hey to Leanne, Ellie May
Mollie Jane and Jordan
They are awesome

Say no more, son
The rage of the Lord will take the form
Of Shaper Storms
Hurricanes, tornados, gale force winds
Changing falling trees
To paper torn in pieces
Nature reborn a naked fetus
Come face to face with all your fears
Chase the storm and leap in

Choose:

[Hook]
Gloomy safety
Or beautiful danger
The daily mundane streets
Or brutal nature
Be one of the few
That's brave enough
To choose your fate, bruh
Be one of the few
That makes opportunities
And moves the stakes up

Are you a consumer
Or are you a creator
Are you a producer
Or are you a potato
Be one of the few today
To use your labour to your favor
Be one of the few
Generating greater boons to human nature
