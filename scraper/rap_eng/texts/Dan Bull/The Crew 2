[Verse 1]
It isn't hard to make a bar with an homophone
I could do it in a bar when I'm on my phone
Own cars as a status symbol
Drum hard, look at the state of the cymbal
As well as drive, fly high, it's a cool principle
But I wanna see more skin, I'm a high school principal
No training wheels, I'm a grown adult
You're someone who makes people groan, a dolt
I mean, oh my God, holy shit
I knew you were bad, but you're wholly shit
I forget, it's a lapse in memory
When I die, strip club funeral, sit on laps in memory
Now that's a ceremony, winning first place
As if everybody wouldn't have done it in the first place
I get berzerk in a duel, carried away
Break the speed limit down a dual carriageway
Name something faster, be my guest
Nothing but an actual light beam, I guess
But mate, get too close, I do brake checks
Bank balance so big, I break checks
But with all the race prize money that I accrue
I take on employees, hire crew
Slowcoach, I'm packing a high IQ
I smoke in traffic, when I'm high, I queue
Whether four or two wheeled
I'm equipped with more metaphors than a fellow ought to wield
Rally through the night to the misty morning
Your family crying cause they missed you, mourning
I've traveled through time, battled and fought knights
You've just done a royale battle in Fortnite
You don't go backwards, and neither forwards
I'm working on a book, I need a foreword

[Hook]
This is the chorus of the song
The Crew
It doesn't seem to be so long since
The Crew
But I guess a sequel's overdue to
The Crew
Take the same game and then add a two to
The Crew

[Verse 2]
Do please curb your enthusiasm
Or I'll leave you on the curb, you're in fear, see, as I'm
Fiercely cleaning my lights, rub my lamp sipping slow gin
What I mean is, I'm a speed genie, you're a slow Djinn
So then, the ball's in your court
You better have big balls or you're caught
Here my engine roar, grizzly
Pull out your entrails raw, grisly
Give me gore, no ifs or buts
I'll leave you with sore butts
Kick your nuts, below the waist
Your career's nothing, bub - a load of waste
I take it it's plain to see
I'm taking this plane to sea
I'm a sick pilot, fly like a bird flew
You're just sick, could be swine or the bird flu
Turbine burning, turning the rotor
So get to work, it's your turn in the rota
From the west coast to the Soviet Bloc
If you're trolling me, well then so be it, blocked
Don't want what you're spamming, anyone could peddle wares
But can you slam it to the metal 'til the pedal wears?
Yes, wild animal, I'm well feral
Talladega Nights, Adam McKay, and Will Ferrell
As well as beating you down when we race the tracks
I'll delete your SoundCloud, erase the tracks
Leave your tires slashed, you're Axl Rose
Crack your suspension, your axle rose
Straight over the J. Edgar Hoover Dam
Looking 'round like, "this place needs a hoover, damn"
And soon when we land and they're closing the hangar
I'll put my flight suit with my clothes on a hanger

[Hook]
This is the chorus of the song
