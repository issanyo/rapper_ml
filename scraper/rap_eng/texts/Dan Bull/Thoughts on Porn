[Chorus]
When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate

[Verse 1]
This morning somebody asked me for
My thoughts on porn in aural form
So I thought and thought
Until I was ethically caught in an awful storm
What does triple X stand for?
Is it having sex to get cash for your landlord?
If this is the case then what makes
Women who've done porn different than whores?
Is it a grand form of liberation
Helping women get away from the kitchen basin?
Being stripped from aprons has lit the way for them
To whip their tits out for the titillation
Of the internation, so whether you think it's great
Or a disgrace, jump into the debate
I ain't made my mind up if I'm honest
So I'd like to find out what you're writing in the comments

[Chorus]
When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate

[Verse 2]
At the push of a button
You'll come across something to push your buttons
You could look at the butts of a Russian couple
That's rutting under the covers or something
It brings in billions in revenue
More than censorship could ever do
As well as huge fees Kleenex collects
Whenever their tissue is issued your residue
And yes it's true, that's an unethical view
To present on a semi-human petting zoo
But it's evident you, can never be a true
Economic liberal unless you let it be viewed
I regret to be rude, but, when you get in the nude
Who the heck else is it that says what you can do?
When someone puts their boobs on Yuvutu
Is it different to a student mooning on YouTube?

[Chorus]
When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate

[Verse 3]
Porn creates an unrealistic expectation of females
So? My vids create an unrealistic expectation of emails
Do you think we should ban them or live with the fact
That fiction and fact are different matters?
How are you wagging the fingers you fap with
At that while you sit at the back of the cinema
Laughing at at Jennifer Aniston kissing a man
It's a bit of a hypocritical act
And people have equal rights
Not to be treated as pieces of meat for the pie
To receive the meagrest slice
With the notable exception of cream pie
There's umpteen types of erotica
So knocking the lot is illogical
That's what Mr Spock'd be calling
If all of the porn was put onto the bonfire
And the rest of the men'd be stressing out
Like Spock when it's Pon farr

[Chorus]
When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate

[Verse 4]
Anyway, they only do it to pay the bills
But you could say that for any tradesman's skills
I'm sure a builder doesn't lay bricks
Just for the kicks
So what the fuck is the difference with sucking some dicks?
Oh, it must be the typically patriarchal
Chauvinist hegemonic culture of repression
Expressing contempt for those with different chromosomes than someone with a prick
I dunno, it doesn't quite stick
Cos if it's an amateur stripping for cameras
And still acting similarly amarous
Is it as scandalous?
If the answer is different, your opinion is ripped into tatters
You don't need to finger an abacus
To put two twos together, the digit's apparent, thus:
Zero, nada, zilch, nothing
Yet still people wanna be filmed fucking
Whether or not there's a lorry load of cheddar
The junk in the trunk wants to keep on trucking

[Chorus]
When you're looking for
Material to stimulate
It's very rare that you
Might think about how it is made
And just because it feels so good
It doesn't mitigate
The need for reasonable debate
So let me illustrate
