To the Swedish administration
This is a plea of my own
On be half of Peter Sunde
My friends in Sweden
And around the world
We sailed a long way

We've trod the corridors of law
To reach the final door
The people have been patient
But its the final straw
They're waiting for someone
To show they've got a spinal cord
And challenge what the dinosaurs
All decide in court
Take a seat
And read the plea through comfortably
To see the numbers
1.corruption running deeper
Than a sea cucumber
2.to ring the police
And have them bring in Peter Sunde
Would simply be another
In a string of recent blunders
3. he's a man that's wrapped up
In mystique and wonder
So let this rap rip up
And tear your thin belief asunder
Peter Sunde
Freedom king or evil monster?
Should we let freedom ring
Or bring in the demon hunter?
It seems to me
That piracy's to thieve and plunder
To wreak a streak of greed
Among the seas to feed your hunger
And each of us did something mean
When he or she was younger
But when reason leaves arenas
Then it leaving me to wonder
See, cos until recently
Sweden won a reputation
Which it demonstrated
To more unprogressive nations
But when surrendering
To pressure from the states
Then their levels of respect
Entered a trend of degradation
That inevitably shakes
The nation's faith in legislation
So fling it out the window
Lest you face defenestration
And while the crocodiles
Are circling and salivating
I'll allocate an alligator
At the allegations
There's not a shred of evidence
To back up accusations
This case is an embarrassment
To your administration

Hur ska Peter
Ta sig ur denna situationen
Dan Bull tar upp
Den allmänna diskussionen
Jag lärde mig tillräckligt
Av det svenska språket
För att hjälpa Peter
Ur det dumma bråket
Detta är ett tydligt
Rättshaveri
Staten visar ett
övertydligt hyckleri

See, the Swedish legal system
Is under the scrutiny
Of a hundred million
Different computer screens

We've trod the corridors of law
To reach the final door
The people have been patient
But its the final straw
They're waiting for someone
To show they've got a spinal cord
So is it you
I'll leave you with that final thought
