[Intro]
This beat here is huge
It's time to get tough
I've got the nuclear codes, now

[Verse]
Your dreams and nightmares just became reality
And now your tax dollars go to pay my salary
Ha, Hillary, it didn't take much for me to crush here
Except, perhaps, a teeny little extra push from Russia
Hey, I warned you all along that the election was rigged
Now let's switch our best fighter jet for a MIG
I'm gonna drain the swamp in Washington
'Cuz letting any politician but talk's a waste of oxygen
Beat illegals? We'll get Mexico to build a wall
Terrorists and New York Times Journalists, kill them all
So bitter, I come up with solid gold shit to stick on Twitter
While I'm sitting on my solid gold shitter
Spend a minimum of ten grand when I go to dinner
I grab a waitress by the pussy, but I don't tip her
No malt liquor, I'm an XO sipper
Ho hitter, vote rigger, still a show winner, go figure
Liberals are so triggered, mad as Margot Kidder
Call me Neo-Hitler, married to a gold digger
I call up Kanye, Milo, Nige and Alex Jones
Target ISIS, whoops, we hit a random home
They were probably bad guys, don't start this debate again
I never said it wouldn't take pain to make us great again
I'm tired of being politically or factually correct
It's President Trump now, you can cancel the elect

[Outro]
Won't be needing that anymore
I'm smart, you're stupid
I'm tough, you're weak
I'm the President
You're not
The triumphant Trump
