[Intro]
Combat
Prepare for combat

[Verse 1]
Allow Mr. Bull to introduce you
To a soldier in the future
Who's been moulded and reduced
Into the coldest single shooter
In control of a computer
Since the last one, whoever that was
Was flatter than the default backdrop
On an old laptop

A soldier's silhouette glimmers in the distance
The electric light flickers
And he's missing in an instant

Sitrep:
You and your clique are going to get wrecked
For forcing me to write a rhyme
Where I mispronounce "Respect"
Testing my reflex
Is messing with a bee's nest
I suggest it'd be best to leave
Please be my guest

Receiving threats
But I don't even stress
How can I be grieving
When I don't believe in death?
You sneaky shoulder peeking spec
Come back and meet your nemesis
'cause he's a deeper threat
Than even NEMEXIS
You can count my kills, my deaths
And peep at dem assists
I'm not even prejudiced
I'm just a me supremacist

[Hook]
Combat
I dominate you
You're the low common denominator
Combat
I'll kick you constantly like I was an elite moderator

[Verse 2]
Achtung!
Engage Operation: Black Lung
Your obligation:
Bring the population back
From the grasp of a virus
Inside the shaft of a mine
There's more to be frightened of in the lack of light
Than massive spiders' appetites

We need to travel deeper
Reach the lab and grab the research
We're being attacked
The meagre shack is feeding cabin fever
Don't breathe the gas, we're leaving
After we can blast the bleeders
The gashes their slashes leave are scratches
Pass the tweezers

My first aid is first rate
Wrapping tourniquets
Round burst veins like burst mains
And you complain of shirt stains?
Err, mate
I just averted your fate
And turned it away
Gave you another birthday, so I'd say I'm deserving of cake
Served on a plate
But you're determined to hate
Trapped in a terminal state of permanent rage
If there's a Hall of Fame for jerks
You're earning a place
So save your breath, don't QQ
Get on the train and GTFO
Choo Choo!

[Hook]
