[Verse 1]
You're a dead man walking
Going hard on the brakes
It's like you're Dead Man Walkn
Going hard on the breaks
I'm going to LA
To roll over you, ese
Then I've got to get to New York today
Roll over USA
Set the car onto cruise control
And roll on the roads that my crews control
Nothing hits harder than damn bull bars
I mean, nothing hits harder than Dan Bull bars
Race in a race with me?
You'll blow your tyre out
Go face to face with me?
You blow, you'll tire out
Car to car, I'll always have more torque in a bout
Disagree or think differently?
What you talking about?
I'm street racing in your borough
Underground
Chasing you bunnies back to your burrow
Underground
I killed and left your pet Kookaburra
On the ground
Then bring a spade to its grave, bruh
And dig 'round
My favourite place to import coffee from
And the type of instant coffee that I like?
Burundi...
...Ground

[Hook]
This is the chorus of the song
THE CREW

[Verse 2]
When I'm in my car I'm going hard with it
You be soft
You're in the pits when I wave the black flag
Ubisoft
They could try and stop us in a copse and rob us
Modern Highwaymen
It's real life cops and robbers
You tried to build a little scene
And got no-one to show for it
I jacked a limousine
Now there's no-one to chauffeur it
I'll tailgate your Mercedes-Benz
Until you hit a tree and see how your Mercedes bends
I don't just flip a policeman
I flip the police, man
When you hear a siren you're like:
"Flip, the police, man!"
My fans are like my wheels
With the screeches I elicit
Hey listen, your track record just isn't as ill, is it?
Illicit street courier
Good at getting gear
Look at you struggle with the clutch
You couldn't get in gear
I'm an important geez, importing keys
I'm feared by the stevedores in ports and quays
If my car reaches a river then I'll take it to the bridge
Where I'll, make like James Brown and take it to the bridge

[Hook]

[Outro]
I'm a lyrical and homonymical brain
That's why I made every line the same
