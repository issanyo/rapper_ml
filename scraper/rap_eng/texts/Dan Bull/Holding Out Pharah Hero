[Intro]
Valiant as Pharah
Keep the skies clear for me
Let's keep the skies clear together
Remember your training and we'll get through this just fine

[Chorus]
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons

[Verse 1]
A little girl Fareeha Amari (ah)
Had a dream of being in the army
Her mama's Ana and her mama ran away
Didn't want to but a Widow made her unable to stay
Wasn't the best of times
It could have messed her mind up
But instead she just kept the drive to do her exercises
As she set her mind on being the best of fighters to bless the sky
How did she get so far in the Egyptian army?
With commitment, persistence and grit beyond even the veteran officers
She kept on rising so her next new job is not a big surprise, is it?
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Excuse me while I kiss the sky now
Excuse me while I kill this guy

[Chorus]
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons

[Bridge (talking)]
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons

[Verse 2]
(Listen up)
It is always best to be diligent (diligent)
When you're protecting the innocent (innocent)
From the sinners and the criminals and militants
So fill them with a million little lessins in discipline (discipline)
Addressing their ignorance (ignorance)
Resetting the legend of Icarus (Icarus)
They don't respect the traditions
So fetch the munitions and get in position
I bet they'll regret their dicisions
When the're isn't a thing left of their ligaments
There, that's a heck of a difference, isn't it?
An exemplary contemporary Egyptian that
Feared she would have to make the decision
As to which mattered more: the man or the mission?
That isn't a decision you should do when you're stressed
It's a black and white issue in a blue and gold dress
(Valiant as Pharah)

[Chorus]
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons

[Verse 3]
She's the ultimate rocket man, sorry I misgendered
This is an inclusive game, I should have remembered
Pharah's not the type for the likes of Nigel Farage
She'll break down barriers with a barrage
A keen eye
So far as I can see (see?)
So Pharah's eye can see even farther than I can see
See, she's tatted up with the Eye of Horus
So Pharah's seen it all before in the past like the chorus

[Chorus]
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons
(Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons)
