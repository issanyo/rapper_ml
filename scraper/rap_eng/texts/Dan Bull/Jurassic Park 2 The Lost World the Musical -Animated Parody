Ian
John Hammond wonʼt stop putting people in danger
Sent my girlfriend to go study dino behavior
Took a boat with some guys to go find and save her
Before Stegos find her with their baby, to them sheʼs a stranger
Hammondʼs nephew brings another team to round the dinos up
Til Nick frees the beasts, and they run amuck
Sarah and him want to help the Rex baby
I had the same thought as you, theyʼre both crazy

Rex Mama:
I can see our son, inside
Thereʼs no point to try and hide
But once heʼs home and safe, weʼll push them off the cliff, cause we are p***ed

Chorus (Rex Papa):
Baby
Weʼre searching for our baby
Baby
Weʼre protecting our baby
Our sweet baby Rex
Whoʼs death will come next?

Ian Malcom:
Weʼre stranded here, enemies are now allies
We have a common goal of not wanting to die
Donʼt go off for a hike all by yourself
The Compys will swarm you, detrimental to your health
The Tyranosaurs tracked us to our camp
Chase our group away, crushing Carter like a stamp
Escape through the long grass, raptors attack
More men than they can eat, what a hell of a snack

Rex Mama:
Ambushing this group, and chase
They shoot back at me, naïve
Iʼll corner them in a cavern, and take one home to eat, wonʼt be discreet

Chorus (Rex Papa):
Baby
Weʼre searching for our baby
Baby
Weʼre protecting our baby
Our sweet baby Rex
Whoʼs death will come next?

Bridge (Roland Rap)
Are you setting up a game trail? Or a buffet?
Just sign the checks and open scotch when we have a good day
You can keep your fee, all I want is a buck
A male T-Rex, as large as ten trucks
The real trick is to make him come to us
Use his infant to lure him like commuters to a bus
Our plans get wrecked, but Iʼll still have my day
Saddle up! Letʼs get this moveable feast on the way

Chorus (Rex Papa):
Baby
Weʼre searching for our baby
Baby
Weʼre protecting our baby
Our sweet baby Rex
Whoʼs death will come next?

Baby
Weʼre searching for our baby
Baby
Weʼre protecting our baby
Our sweet baby Rex
Whoʼs death will come next?
