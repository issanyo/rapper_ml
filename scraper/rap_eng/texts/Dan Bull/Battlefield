[Verse 1]
Look at my dog tag! You'll see D. Bull
A heavy hitter from the midlands like Led Zep have reformed
I don't need the Marine Corps, I'm lethal
From 3,000 miles off the eastern seaboard
Colder than Trebor mints, Nee Naw
K People step away from the keyboard
I wanna see your heads bopping see saw
Up and down so speedy you're reeling from the G-force
Give me a vehicle, a BMD or Super Hornet
Troops are falling uniform superiors are fearful
I'm really tearful
Saline solution slides from my eyes at the same time I'm shooting
So maybe I just should let a Beretta do the talking
'Cos after all, you're a dead man walking
I walk in pull out my M1014 and end all these porkies
And tall stories, with the ease of a nuclear attack
I shout "look behind you" and shoot you in the back
Suited up with flakjackets, flashbanging
Leaving claymores in your path, need I say more?

[Hook]
This is the Battlefield
Where if you lack the skill
Then your cap'll peel back
Like an apple peel, twat
In the Battlefield
If you lack the skill
Then your cap'll peel
Like an apple peel, so grab the steel

[Verse 2]
You're a Super Soaker, I'm a super cobra
Souping up my guns 'till I become a supernova
I'll take you to the moon and over like a lunar rover
I got a new limo and so, are you the chauffeur?
I'm a human Yoda, no, a new Jehovah
I do my flows with the devotion of a Jew to Kosher
So I shoot the charcuter and do him over
I'll do to you've what you seen me do to SOPA
I'll straight flush you like a full suit in poker
And mutilate you leaving you like you're doing yoga
Resume control, assume the role of Henry "Black" Blackburn
I'm coming for your guts like a freaking flatworm
Soon as your back's turned, Blackburn'll blast murder fast
I'm packing more heat than a massive thermostat
I've got a certain knack to turn the gas and hurl a match
So if you'd prefer lack a burn, then stand further back
And slap bureaucrats that I haven't heard the facts
I'm rapping more original than a fricking Werther's Pack
I mix hardcore, nerdcore commercial rap
And stay on top of the beef like a burger bap
I'm a soldier, but not the sort to traverse Iraq
I'll come first in any match on 30 racks of server stacks
I serve a purpose that you might find confusing
Dicing right through the digital illusion of the
