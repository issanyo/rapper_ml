I've found a way out
I've found a way out
A way out of this hell
A way out of this hell
But I can't do it myself
Can't do it all myself
I need a little help
I need a little help
But I've found a way out

[Verse]
Oh howdy, hey y'all
We were about to tell a tale
Of how to get out of jail
Without bail and without fail
No doubt they'll try to follow our trail
So we'll throw them off the smell
Scale mountains and vales
Down roofs and wells
And escape town, raise hell

Quite an incredible story
Two detestable criminals jetted in glory
But you were skeptical towards me
Almost ignored me, really you warned me
Stay away
But I have a daughter
And a father's love is something really strong
Her being far is like fish that's out of water
So I proved that I could be a worthy partner

I scrutinise the new arrivals
To find a suitable sidekick
Who'll survive and who will thrive
If I supervise them through the life
We do inside this human binding zoo
That's grinding you to piles of used detritus
Until a new life is to do or die for

I'm down, damn, don't you understand?
No slack like a racked rubber band
You can stop looking for your other man
We're a team on the way to motherland
And when we're done we can part ways
From this parley, eat a parfait
On the parkway or the pathway
But we can't do this halfway, can we?

I don't want to be behind bars
I want to sleep in five star hotels
And drive cars
Low life with a kind heart
So I'll be right behind you when the fight starts
I'll strike guards
When a couple of die hards combine smarts
It's like "What?"

Whatever it takes
Sever and break
Anybody who would tether our fate
We're doing this now
Hell if I wait
I don't have the time, I'm not in the state
Of mind, I'm putting my trust and my faith
In your plan, I hope I'm not making mistakes
We're seeing this through and scraping the plate
We're breaking our chains and storming the gate

Trust in my decision
Mission: Busting out of prision
Hidden, sussing out the system
Bring the cooking out the kitchen
Cuss each other out like brothers
Busting raps on rhythms
Ay, didn't your mother ever think
To teach you how to listen?

She did, I'm glad I listened to you
This prison is something we're wriggling through
No witnesses, wit and just riveting coup
Positioning us, from vision of you
This is our run, this is our chance
Opportunity for us to advance
I'm taking the reins and taking a stance
We're taking a risk, let's hope that it stands

The penal system sucks
We need to steal a pickup truck
And leave for freedom
Police we leave them in the dust
'cause we could give a fu...
We all have reasons to keep breathing
Even if it means thieving
People we keep dear and need to see them
These are deep feelings

[Hook]
I've found a way out
I've found a way out
A way out of this hell
A way out of this hell
But I can't do it myself
Can't do it all myself
I need a little help
I need a little help
But I've found a way out
