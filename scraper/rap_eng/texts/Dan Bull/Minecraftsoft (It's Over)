[Verse]
Oh Mojang, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well
Enough said
Dear Microsoft, we've got something to say

You just traded for the biggest Indie game
In the Indie game
It just doesn't do it justice, just to pin it with the Indie name
It's amazing just how big this thing became
It's been through stages
Came straight from a Beta on a forum into history's pages
But now the fanbase weeps through flushed and misty faces
No wish to see the game with Windows 8's interfaces
Listen, it isn't as if we hate you, we're just resisting changes
Gamergate displayed it pays to listen when players are pissed and dangerous

It's over, still I cling
I don't know what else I can play

Oh Mojang, I can feel
The soaring overheads
I know it's business, but there is this, look
I know it's business, but there is this, look
This game means so so much to so many people
I can't think of a single community with any equal
There's the streamers, the hardcore and casual players
PC, console, mobile, YouTubers
Making a living from ads on players
Construction on creative, Bukkit, Tekkit, Hunger Games
And tons of countries' young teenagers
That've become eachothers' neighbours
Steve's become a saviour, please don't leave him to become
A slave here, I pray to you, Mojang staff
Please be happy
Corporate suits, don't be brutes
Loud, loutish logo, treat them kindly
Though they need you
More than they love you
You might think I'm daft, asking you to be nice to Minecraft

But I don't mind that, so laugh, my life is quite naff
I've an appetite for trite trash, many nights I've pined, sat
With wine or sank a pint glass, and passed the time with Minecraft
The game's a mate in the bad times I've had
The sad times I've had
But when I craft, those sad times don't matter, no
So you might think I'm daft, asking you to be nice to Minecraft
But I don't mind that, as long as you look after Minecraft
Don't mind that, as long as you look after Minecraft

It's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And Notch even spoke to me and said
"If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if your channel's so good
Then why do you stream alone tonight?"
I know
'Cause tonight is just like any other night
"That's why you're on your own tonight
With your mine and your farms
While they're in each other's arms"
It's so easy to craft, it's so easy to slay
It takes strength to descend into the mine
It's so easy to laugh and poke fun at Bill Gates
It takes guts to attempt such a buy
Oh Mojang
Oh Mojang

Oh Mozza, I can feel
The DMCA over my head
