[Intro: Dan Bull]
Sunbeams
Diffracted and fractured like young dreams
Lost chances to capture these sunbeams
Splintered and shattered like young dreams
That no longer matter

[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
Among a thousand galaxies, each with a thousand stars
You're bound to find another like ours (ah)
Submerged and immersed in a version of earth
From innumerable years before your birth
Crash landed on an aquatic planet, stranded
Surrounded by oceanic expanses and no answers
A load of questions and no language to ask 'em in
But the fact is that I'm fascinated, so fasten in

[Chorus: Dan Bull]
Sunbeams
Dappled, divided like young dreams
Devoured, disunited on sunbeams
Disintegrated like young dreams
Embittered, dismayed
We descended under splentid rolling tides
You could find a hole and hide
Or you can rise, revolt and fight
Seize the day and you control the night

[Verse 2: Dan Bull & Veela]
Deep down, down below the waves
Is a foreboding place from which you won't escape, no
On the sea floor of Aurora
We see flora and fauna
We feel awesome in auras
Of all different sorts, colours, warmths
And they're forming an ecosystem
Different pieces mixed into some biomes
Of symbiosis and I notice that
Such new sights can just bring eyes to focus
So slow down a moment and toke this hypnosis
No smoke in this ocean, we're floating
Unroped from the woes of the coast, no emotion but motion
Moving, soaking, soothing
If I can go there, so can you
Is it the moon in a mist or a lunar eclipse?
There's no mutual exclusion, the two can exist
(Aaah)

[Verse 3: Veela]
Nobody sees me in here
Yet the water's so clear
I guess that confirms what I had thought
Just me and Aurora in the spot
I feel isolation (isolation)
And fascination
I know it seems grim and I am lost
But I won't give in, ignore the cost
(I, oh, mmh)
So I keep gazing at

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Veela]
Sunbeams
Distorted, disjointed like young dreams
Crushed, disappointed, these sunbeams
Fractured, fragmented like young dreams
Left unattended
We descended under splentid rolling tides
You could find a hole and hide
Or you can rise, revolt and fight
Seize the day and you control the night

[Outro: Veela]
And you control the night
And you control the night
You control the night
Ooh
