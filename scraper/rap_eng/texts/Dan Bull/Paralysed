[Verse 1: Beit Nun]
Watch me paint myself into this room, like syd did
Truly twisted, more screwed than the music business (yeah)
Who is this? Tunes got me lifted
It's the psychedelic relic, Beit Nun... never knew my limits
When playin mates my lyrics, they labelled me gifted (true)
So every record I did was made for my critics
Every syllable tailor fitted
Wrote a classic and failed to shift it
All that work, and it didn't make a difference (nah)
Being disregarded hit me the hardest
It put a chink in my armour, I'm an insignificant artist
Beneath, I'm a sensitive soul
Feel like I've hit the wall
Ben's in a hole and now he questions his role
Don't know my place, 'cause I've never been shown
In a world i thought where anything goes, they left me alone
I saw everyone around me get what they're owed
When I can barely put a meal together and December is cold

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
I'm pretty sure I haven't moved for the best part of an hour
Cursed with the mind of a hero, and blessed with the heart of a coward
Yes, I've started it now, I'm barking and shouting
Asking for help, harmfully loud but I can't turn it down
I panic in a bar when it's crowded I'd rather be out in the beer garden
And downing my half of lager I'm drowning my self harm
In itself (damn) I'm out, just gimme a moment
Now I'm sitting at home look Ben, you should get in the zone and own it

[Verse 3: Beit Nun]
Dan, I've got this, gimme 10, and the 8's down
I'm really feelin it, yeah, it's a great sound (wow)
Spaced out with the phones on
This beat is inspiring a beautiful song
It's been so long since I wrote one
Who in the world has time for writing music
Between a soul-destroying 9-5 slog and a morbid night of boozin
That I choose to use to fight the blues with?
But I've got a gift, and I like to prove it, let's do this

[Verse 4: Dan Bull]
Just give me a minute
The rhythm is spinning, I feel like I'm in it
Thought I'd hit the perimiter, but there isn't a limit (is there?)
Pictures of trysts with women are swimming within and it's blissfully vivid
Is this a significant image, or just a libidinous mimic? (I don't know)
Mixing the spirits, 'til the spirits are lit up and lifted
Quick, tip us a sip of Glenlivet Sniffing the snifter, this is exquisite
Swear I'm finna just finish it, til I finish up sick in a clinic
Not every trip is a picnic, I've been in this since the beginning
I'm different to Robbie Williams, I won't just sing when I'm winning
You cynical listeners listen to lyrics I'm getting the hits on
Still living in ignorance of the hidden hit songs the critics are missing
Just gimme a second, hold up just a couple of minutes
I'm seeing double, the juxtaposition's fucked my vision
Good job the stereo's balanced, because I'm hooked to the rhythm
When I want to cut the traditions and touch something different I look to musicians
