[Intro]
EA (huh)
More like GA
Y?

[Verse 1]
The Family Research Council are doubtful
Of anything but conventional spousal arousal
The downfall of society is gay gay games
It's like the KKK came at gays
In the lamest of ways, laying the blame on EA
Aiming their flames in their face, but they have made a mistake
The very basic aim that makes a game a game is choice
So if you take the choice away, then what's the flaming point?

[Chorus 1]
It is okay to go gayming
Whatever pushes your buttons
It is okay to go gayming
Hey, it's just co-operative play

[Verse 2]
There's gays in cinema, there's gays in literature
There's gays in nature, even gay general practitioners
Folks go for ovaries or are testicular particular
So isn't prohibiting it a little bit ridiculous?
To get your knickers in a twist over someone else's
Thinking too much about whose bum they're pals with
You waste your days away complaining about trousers
And who pulls them down, is there something you should tell us?

[Chorus 2]
It's okay to go gayming
Whatever pushes your buttons
It is okay to go gayming
Hey

[Verse 3]
If Jesus was a gamer, he'd play Mass Effect
And the fact that there was gayness wouldn't make him that upset
See, he'd be more inclined to deplore the kind of bigotry
That enforces "don't ask, don't tell" inside the military
And that's the thing, I see you righteously fight for guidance
But on gratuitous violence then you are silent
But unlike the Rebel Alliance your petty defiance
And whether it's pious will die under the light of science (ah)

[Chorus 3]
Because it is okay to go gayming
Whatever pushes your buttons
It is okay to go gayming
Hey

It's okay
