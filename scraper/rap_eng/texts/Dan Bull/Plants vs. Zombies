[Player]
Hey, what's happening, Z?
What's that, you're battling me?
Well actually
You're about to meet my Gatling Pea
I send you back to sleep;
You can come and take a dirt nap with me

[Zombies]
You must be low on chloroplasts
Because your raps are weak
I'm causing a solar eclipse
For the whole of your clique
So nobody's growing an inch
'Til I roll over you:
Pins
You've got all the greens, roots, and pea shooters
So it's kind of ironic that your efforts seem fruitless
We're Zombies!
Yeah, you better be very scared of us
Because, just for you, we're temporarily vegetarians

[Player]
Yeah but comparing plants vs zombies
Is apples and oranges...

[Zombies]
That's cos we're opposites:
Capitalists and Communists-

[Player]
-Capulets and Montagues
Come on, just be honest, dude!
You can't do half the practical shit that Monty Don could do
I'm the sweetest glucose producer
The yonkers of conkers
Odd Fuschia
Bring your whole ground force
I mow down foes
True to my roots, so don't doubt I won't go down low

[Zombies]
Oh, Wow, Whoa!
The grass is always greener

[Player]
Don't doubt, yo!

[Zombies]
My raps is always meaner
Baseball star wth my face all scarred
I will raid your garden and take your car-
And by car I mean brains
But brains didn't rhyme
That's why I said that I would take your car
Mate, I'm a Gar...
...Gantuar

[Player]
Really? I was thinking what a wanker you are

[Zombies]
(Hey!)

[Together]
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

[Zombies]
(Seriously, Zombies are the best)

[Player]
Hit you with mushrooms
Pow!
Leave a mushroom cloud
That's one fewer task that I must do now
Feel the flower power of my Power Flower
Our powers combined will keep you routed for hours
The Jack Bauer of flowers
Attack towers, I'll clout you!
I smack cowboys and doubters
Pirates and parrots
Keep them out of my house!
Raa!

[Zombies]
Ha haha ha!
Man, I laugh at your ballads
Hmm, what's on the menu?
I think I'm having a salad
Traverse your Astroturf
'Til the dirt is a path and I'll prove
I'm the top rapper in the Popcap back catalogue, Dude
(Yay!)

[Player]
When you all attacked I'd have thought you must be insane
If it weren't for the mutual lack of a functioning brain
It ain't wise to go against the grain
I'm a thorn in your side causing no end of pain

[Zombies]
It's a joke you think your flowers are powerful
(Ha Ha)
You know the Tower Defence
I know the Tau of War
(Whoa!)

[Player]
That's a lie, that's a lie
You're just cadavers in morgues

[Zombies]
But you could even be defeated by a shambling corpse
(Ooohh)

[Together]
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

[Zombies]
(Ooohh)
Call me a bonehead
'Cause you can see the bone in my head
Call me a Cone Head
Because I put a cone on my head
(Yeah)
I don't need to be clever
My lines are so nice, check it
URRRRRGHHHHHHHHHH
We're kind of concise
And I'm not entirely sure
Why there are hordes of violent corpses
At the side of the lawn either
But we are inclined to use force

[Player]
Well I'd say that you brainless failures
Were a pain in the anus
But that ain't the way that I do away with my waste, cuz
If you ain't hearing this
I make you face my acespearagus
There ain't a way that I can make it clearer than this:
Liches should know
I ditch the bitches and hoes
For ditches and hoes
And so I'm soaking you pricks with my hose

[Zombies]
HA!
I'll murderize you
You're in deep shit now:
Fertilizer
I'll chow down on your hard fiber into my carcass
'Cause it's harvest time and I'm the combine harvester

[Player]
Nah, man, I'm sick, bruh
Fam, I spit bars
Like Alan Titchmarsh
If he had a kid with Rick Ross
Me, I'm boasting on bumping beats
'Bout roasting you punks like pumpkin seeds
Me?
Hard Nut

[Zombies]
You?
Bars suck!
Plants?

[Player]
Champs
Zombies
Hard luck

[Together]
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

[Zombies]
(Don't forget the Zombies)

[Together]
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

[Zombies]
(Yeah, Zombies, Woo!)

[Together]
Zombies!
Plants vs Zombies!

[Zombies]
(UUUUUGHHHHHHHHHH)
