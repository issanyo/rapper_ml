[Verse 1]
I'm stranded in space
So I place my hands on my face
Did you guess
This isn't a situation I can handle with grace?
Nevertheless, Dan's on the case
And I never pander to tastes
In case they change like the range of animals and plants in this place
I've visited all different corners of the Galaxy
There isn't any flora and fauna that I haven't seen
I'm interplanetary
Always in thrall of the random scenes
Tangerines
Dreams
You'll never see such things in your National Geographic magazine
Grab a bit of cobblestone
Carry it and hobble home
Boulders on my shoulders and I'm sorry for my collarbone
But I've got to build a model home
I don't want it to be monochrome
Colours light my life when I'm on my own
If I can't craft with it, I don't want to know
I don't want to, no
Oh, what a homophone

Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now
Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now

[Verse 2]
I'm a hip hopper
Got a disk in my shiplocker
Might be fly, swap a wing for a pig trotter
Tick tock
Plot thickening to get hotter
Planet calling Daniel, I think I need an ink blotter
You're full of gas like a Novakid
Aww, did I make you sad?
Well I hope I did
I'm cooking up a plan and I'm about to blow the lid
Although there's nothing in the pan so don't open it
So hungry
So hungry
I'm in a hurry to put something in my tummy
So hungry
I'm so hungry
I'm in a hurry to put something in my tummy
Yummy
Brineapple pie, Neonmelon and a Pineapple
Pine for a Coralcreep
Curry
Curry
I'm so hungry
I'm in a hurry to put something in my tummy

Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now
Starbound son
Beam me down
I am a Starbound son
Leave me now

[Verse 3]
I need to explore
I've got an aching feeling, the call:
The Universe is waiting
This is a race for the mineral and ore
Love the thrill of the chase so I'm winning in the war
Love Dreadwing Penguin
I pin him to the floor with a minimum of effort
Then I'm ready for some more
I need to explore
I've got an aching feeling, the call:
The Universe is waiting
Every Galaxy is a snowflake
Floating in the sky like an island, no fake
This is a fact; it's actual
Zoom in and in and in
And interact with the fractal
Every snowflake is a Galaxy
Floating in the sky like an eye looking back at me
This is a fact; it's actual
Zoom in and in and in
And interact with the fractal

Leave me now

Beam me down
