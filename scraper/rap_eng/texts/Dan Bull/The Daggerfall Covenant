[Verse 1]
It’s the dawn of the Second Era, war is getting nearer
Former enemies get together form a better, clearer
Bigger force of Bretons, Orcs and Redguards
To fill hearts with dread and leave seas of heads scarred
The Bretons are the Westerners that trek the depth and breadth
Of Tamriel through Hammerfell ‘til we have dealt with every pestilence
In essence, Bretons are the sages of the lessons in the pages
Of the Ancient Books, the weapons of the mages
Respected through the ages as professional and gracious
Due to dressing in the raiments of the excellentest tailors
The Gift of Magnus give us bags of extra Magicka
So many spells you’d have a hella job to add it up
We swear fealty to High King Emeric
And anybody that doesn’t is going to get a haemorrhage
So pour a beverage, and hold it up high
Promise to serve the Covenant even if we must die
No other government is running us; we’re warriors
They cannot worry us; we do not know what worry is
From the humblest man to the baddest Lord
Raise our hands up with the flags and let the dagger fall

[Hook]
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
Deep, and true, and you can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
True, and deep, and we can have it all

[Verse 2]
We are the Orsimer, nobody’s awesomer
War’s in our blood, while yours never poured thinner
Spilling warm innards on the floor in a small inn
And eat poor little paupers up, for dinner
Pick up the porter and pour in some more liquor
Raw ichor, getting slaughtered’ll leave you
All with a little bit more than a sore liver
You’ve no more hope than a small glimmer
Your Lord’s never ever going to forgive us
Whether Lawgivers or sinners
We are warring for a cause and we fought it with the force
Of a horse with the balls of a pure winner
Blacksmiths, axes, add it to the axis
Of actual madness you’re going to get whacked with
From the humblest man to the Dragonborn
Raise our hands up with the flags and let the dagger fall

[Hook]
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
Deep, and true, and you can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
True, and deep, and we can have it all

[Verse 3]
See the dagger fall after the hammer fell
Plan a parry and it is apparent that your plan’ll fail
From Sentinel, our power’s spanning all of Tamriel
In every race’s annals, tales of our battles sail
Over moats and castles; vales, overdose on powerful ale
For we shall regale you with how we’re tough as dragonscale
Then hit you right on the head like a hammered nail
Breathtaking so don’t forget you can inhale
Stacked physiques, we’re athletes in wrapped sheets
From a land of vast heat, our rap sheets
Are longer than an Abecean Anvil back street
Fact: we eat bread and the crust, and thus we be incredibly buff
But it’s never enough, we never let muscles or metal descend into rust
So anyone coming and messing with us is getting rebuffed, offended and cussed
Then we have push with the adrenaline rush
We leave our enemies crushed with every thrust
So you’d better be hushed lest you end up as dust
Forward for Daggerfall!

[Hook]
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
Deep, and true, and you can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
True, and deep, and we can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
Deep, and true, and you can have it all
Let the dagger fall
Let the dagger fall
True, and deep, and we can have it all
