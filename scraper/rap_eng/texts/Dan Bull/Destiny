[Verse 1]
We called it the Traveller
The Light that had brought us from blackness
To widen, explore other planets, us
A tiny fault on our planet’s surface
Alive and reborn and expanding thus
We must try to be more than our ancestors
So let’s rise before we’re turned back to dust
And fight the force that unravelled us
Redefine our whole existence
Colonise the Solar System
Set our sights on the skies up high
And find the stars our roles are written in
Magnificent, munificent
Giving a gift to the citizens who wish on them
Lifting them up from indifference
Shifting them into significance
A Golden Age...
To control your fate is all the rage
Flip the script, fold the page
This is it, behold the stage
We’ve made the maps but face the facts
Everything great we’ve attained just may collapse
The Collapse has taken our cake away
And we aim to take it back
Any alien race invading our space
We’re making them pay for that
So raid, attack in waves
We’ll aim at your face and blast away the mask
Or take an axe and hack away ‘til we break your back
Grenades and flak won’t chase us back
We’re built to stay in the Milky Way’s new neighbours’ spat
We came from caves and paved the way to today so hey, perhaps That indicates the fact this teensy race adapts, we’re made to last!
The worse our circumstances, the more certain the chance is
We’ll stand resistant, persistently grin in the face of hostility
And live!

[Hook]
Now this is the law of the jungle
As old and as true as the sky
The wolf that shall keep it may prosper
But the wolf that shall break it must die
As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk
The law runneth forward and back
For the strength of the pack is the wolf
And the strength of the wolf is the pack

[Verse 2]
Look!
Guided by the Light we fight the Darkness, so try to start shit
You’ll see the real reason why we can’t be sparred with
The Guardian ranks are highly advanced
Full body armour, no cardigan thanks
Our armoury’s crammed
Fully stocked with rockets, dropships, SR3s and tanks
My blood be pumping, like I’m bungee jumping
Feel the drum keep thumping, like a humvee’s frontpiece rumbling
No fronting, I’m confronting
Sunk drinks, and now I’m drunk
And I want to get a punch in on something
Pull you limb from limb
Pop off the top of your cranium like a pumpkin
Slam dunk it, in the dustbin
So don’t just run, sprint!
‘Cause I’m coming and I’m running and gunning
And I’m a gonna leave you looking like a dumpling
Dum sim, dim sum
I’ve done things, and then some
I’ve seen some things you wouldn’t believe
Even if I took a picture
The Exo vex the Vex so the Awoken will leave the Ogres broken
I’ll give the Cabal a kick in the balls, the Fallen will fall once more
Thralls all on the floor, got a Goblin hobbling
So that Phogoths say “oh gosh”
They won’t want to step out of line
Or so help me, I will go out my mind
I’m a mastermind, attack the Hive
Black the eye of an Acolyte
That smarts, you don’t have to fight to have smarts
But you’ve got to have that to fight
I speak on behalf of my species
And defy you to get the best of me
I’m owed success and will accept no less
It is my destiny!

[Hook]
Now this is the law of the jungle
As old and as true as the sky
The wolf that shall keep it may prosper
But the wolf that shall break it must die
As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk
The law runneth forward and back
For the strength of the pack is the wolf
And the strength of the wolf is the pack

Now this is the law of the jungle
As old and as true as the sky
The wolf that shall keep it may prosper
But the wolf that shall break it must die
As the creeper that girdles the tree trunk
The law runneth forward and back
For the strength of the pack is the wolf
And the strength of the wolf is the pack

[Verse 3]
Earth? We’ll be taking it back
Mercury? Taking it back
Mars? We’re taking it back
Venus? We’re taking it back
Saturn? We’re taking it back
We’re taking it back!
Aliens, they can attack
We’ll raise the stakes and erase the Collapse
Sharp as the blade of a razor
And fast as a hummingbird’s heart
That’s been tazered and caffeinated
Then taped and played back insanely fast
Ha! Made you laugh
I’m keeping your spirits up, never give it up
Whoever’s giving you jip, never give a fuck
Approach this trial with an open mind, feel the flows and rhymes
Glow just like the Awoken’s eyes, it’s closing time
No scope and snipe any Crotan Hive
From Mercury’s ruined gardens, to the swamps of Old Chicago
We will reclaim our homes once more with bravado
Though it may be hard, hope is the fuel that burns our fire
That’s why we’ll fight ‘til we win or die, we won’t retire
That’s why we’ll fight ‘til we win or die, we won’t retire
