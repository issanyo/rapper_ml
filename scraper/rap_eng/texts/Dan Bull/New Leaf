[Intro]
I have found a way out
I have found a way out
It's a dark and desolate path
It will take everything that I've got
But I have found a way out
I have found a way out

[Interlude]
Daniel
Oh Daniel Bull
You are such an awkward boy
Why do you do it
Daniel
Oh Daniel Bull
You might be the death of me
But I love you

[Verse 1]
I put my life on the line, didn't I?
I pegged it up for prying eyes
It was a fresh CD
A clean sheet leaves me high and dry
But try as I might
I can't find the fight to retire, no
So it's time that I livened up
Took a stride to the light and strut

[Verse 2]
I got a clean new opportunity
To produce CD two beautifully
Would you believe I'm in a super-human league
I mean, who else can do what I do to beats musically?
As soon as D.A.N. B.U.L.L. spells trouble
Then you can leave
Meanwhile please stay glued to your seats
So you can see the ace up my new sleeve

[Verse 3]
I didn't decide to pick up a biro, no
Didn't decide to pick up a microphone
Woe betide my open eyes
So I've opened my soul, and lo and behold
Ive broken the mould
Try as I might
I can't find the fight to retire, no
So it's time that I livened up
Took the mic and said "hiya chuck"

[Outro]
If I was a peg (which I'm not)
I'd hold you
But I have found a way out
I have found a way out
