[Intro]
I'd like to tell you
Some uncomfortable truths
This will now happen

[Verse 1]
Within a few years
The elephants are gonna die
But they're less important to our ecosystem than a fly
(Why?)
All of our actions
Are ultimately selfish
Even when we help the helpless
We're thinking what we can get out of this
No need for an apology
It's just biology
Because we’re stronger in a colony
And honestly
I can't debate the fact my claims will be debated
I can't overstate the fact I'm underrated

I can't stand or understand the fact I'm hated
I tried being understated
'till I realized it was overrated
Your tablet phone was made by modern-day slave labour
The world today is a race to make us chase paper to the grave

Spend, spend, spend! but make sure you save for later
Haters are gonna hate
But maybe what they're sayin' will save ya'
Insane or saviour
Am I a liar
Pariah
Messiah
Or a normal guy with a desire to inquire?

I'm adding fuel to fire
I draw the ire I decided the dividing line
Like a binary multiplier

We're all bullied in school
But never did it ourselves
That doesn't add up
You are a bully without knowing as well
You're guilty of stuff you'd have others thrown in a cell for
So look close to home
Before telling us what we're going to hell for

[Chorus]
Look at the elephant!
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant

[Verse 2]
Now
Human rights are universal
'cause they mean nothing unless given to the worst of us
Regardless of what people do
Murderers are people too
Who legally you're equal to
There's no line between good and evil, dude
There's only actions and intentions
A result of chemical reactions and events
And any ethical infractions
That you care to add to that are an invention
But don't pretend that that's an invitation
To act a twat
'cause you're ingrained with empathy
Advanced behavior
Saviour
But you have more empathy for people of your own race
For those whose skin tone fits that of your own face
(Don't blame me, I'm just saying)

The capacity's in all of us for genocide
It's best to face the demon inside than try to run and hide
Nazis were people, too
(What?)
If you'd have been in their circumstances
The certain chance is you would be one, too

Pedophiles are people, too
That's their sexuality
It's not a choice, they're not criminals
Unless they breach legality
And when the age of consent changes internationally
Ranging from 8 to 18
Then it's a massive leap
You may feel uncomfortable
But it’s the truth, actually
Like the fact that you're a walking, talking poo factory

[Chorus]
Look at the elephant!
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant

[Verse 3]
Within a few years
The elephants are gonna die
But they're less important to our ecosystem than a fly
(Oh my!)
And transsexual is genetically their birth gender
It's burnt into the embers of their cells like the Earth's center

We can pretend
But in the end eventually
Identities inconsequential conscious beings are non-essential
Disagree?
Each piece of meat you eat was born of suffering
Most reasons for eating it recede to nothing when you look at it

And similarly with abortion
A significant portion of the arguments
Can apply to infants that are already born
If you say you refuse to go back to coat hangers
Then the NRA could claim the same ‘We won't go back to daggers!'
You may say 'It's none of our business as a cis-head prick'
But I'm not one for indifference
I'm at odds with it is what it is
Regardless of whose gob's admitting it
So if you've got a problem we're listing it
It's probably the cognitive dissonance kickin' in

Some of your most deep and strong beliefs are wrong
Mine too
Read along to the lyrics of this song
You'll probably see the ones
To err is human
To forgive divine
To redefine what we believe is right
Is to see behind the scenes to really feel alive
To be reminded of the blood
The guts
The bones
And the meat inside
I really tried
But this feeling can't even be described
It's too revealing
I can't be surprised
We try to keep it hiding at times
Fear takes over
So like Peter we deny
But the beauty within reason
Seems it cannot be defined
Everyone will compromise their morals for enough money
And farts will always, always be funny

[Chorus]
Look at the elephant!
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the fucking elephant, the elephant
Look at the motherfucking elephant

[Bridge]
You are going to die
No, really. Listen to me
You
Are
Going
To die
Now I don't care about advances in cryogenics
Or the infinite universe theory
You
Are
Going
To die
