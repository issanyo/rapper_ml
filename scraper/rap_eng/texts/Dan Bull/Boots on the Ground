[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
I'm imbued with the spirit of the English Tommy
Dunno my kill count, it's bigger than the fingers on me
Imma sing a song for the memory that lingers on
When everything is gone and makes grown men scream for mommy
You've never seen a zombie, until you've seen your best friend
Trying to scoop his intestines back into his bleeding tummy
Muffled battle tunes, hum and rattle through the shrapnel wounds
Crushing out the fluid of the fruits of war like apple juice

Thickly trickle all down the tricolour flag that's in tatters
Its fabric is ragged and haggard, telling a France that is shattered
That there's still a thread of hope somewhere through the telescope
It's difficult to tell it though, invisible there's hella smoke
That'll envelop and choke a delicate bloke into silence
So telling a joke is a method of coping with violence
You're thrown into darkness when even the stars are going out
Fifty million little candles, blown out

[Pre-Chorus]
This is it, you already know
It's okay, just get ready, go
Your life, gotta lay it down
Ain't no time to play around, everybody say it loud:

[Chorus]
I sacrifice myself
I commit to the cause, no hesitation
Fight, 'til there's no one left
I am leading the charge against a nation
Ain't gonna die, fighting in a war that I am bound
Aim for the sky, but I'm keeping my boots on the ground

[Verse 2: Daddyphatsnaps]
Gotta get my mind right, mission: storm the beach of Normandy
Sent a letter to my family and told them orally
Before I left that I'd be coming back, so we can normally
Return to our routine, resume the spot that I was formerly
This isn't what I do the majority of the time
I am morally intact, abnormal to me the grime
But these are different days, I grab my weapon clammily
Insanity is war, but I do it for my family
Focus on the task, block the chatter and profanity
Of other soldiers on the craft, screaming of calamity
Disappear into a canopy of tragic fantasies
Where I don't make it back, getting crushed by the gravity of that reality
I won't put them through the agony
Of growing up without a father, teach them how a man should be
Pull yourself together, soldier, heart is beating rapidly
And if you're gonna survive, you're gonna need a strategy

Knuckle up, it's time
You're pushing through the casualty
Keep your aim true, turn them into shooting galleries
Unleashing a battery, you don't need no cavalry
This is war, and we're fighting for our families

[Chorus]
I sacrifice myself
I commit to the cause, no hesitation
Fight, 'til there's no one left
I am leading the charge against a nation
Ain't gonna die, fighting in a war that I am bound
Aim for the sky, but I'm keeping my boots on the ground

[Outro]
This day have set upon a mighty endeavor, a struggle to preserve our Republic [...] and our civilization [...]. Success may not come with rushing speed, but we shall return again and again; [...] until the victory is won
