[Verse 1]
In the good﻿ times we stood side by side
Till you were blinded
By bright lights enticed by high life
In hindsight the highlight of my life
Was you and I laughing and having a nice time
Time flies it was years since I last was certain
I had not swerved from the right path
Deserted deprived of dirt that I am
The person I had been turned inside out

Hurt and dried out by winds of change
Fingers frail and a face now emersed﻿ in lines
Wrinkles ailing health are things that age
And self pity bring day in, day out
I've hours and hours of days to dwell of how I have failed myself So now I just pray for help
About how I can raise myself out from this
Groundhog day and save myself

[Verse 2]
When I play back the scenes of my youth
It seems me and you would have hated to seperate
I hesitated wasting being with you
Now were a distant step away from the better days
Let us pray that one day we'll﻿ be back
And living happily as if things had never changed
We could celebrate our freedom seven days a week
And never have to seperate from each other
Just spend our days in each others company
'Till each piece of the puzzle becomes complete
There's something sweet in the feeling life will end safe
I pretend sometimes that I've already met fate
I'm lying dead wake with baited breath
Legs of lead that I'm waiting for death
To take my life away so I can say I've finally made headway
A rest safe not lying
Bedshaped
