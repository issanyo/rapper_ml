[Intro]
I'm a Hanzo main
I'm a Hanzo main
I'm a Hanzo main
Got no mates, I'm a Hanzo main
(Hanzo)

[Verse 1]
If you stay seated by the river patiently
The bloated bodies of your enemies will float toward the waiting sea
Don't believe it? Wait and see
Learn to seperate haste and speed
And you will take the lead with graceful ease
Strive for perfection in the art of deception
With every death comes honor, with honor, redemption
When he strikes at the heart, his arrow's finding its mark
Truly, true mastery is the highest of arts

[Chorus]
Hanzo, the man bow, samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro
Hanzo, the man bow, samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro

[Verse 2]
Oh, he sees that which is unseen
Umpteen hits on anyone deemed unclean (you)
His aim's as straight as a sunbeam
Concealing his footsteps underneath the drum beat (boom)
You've been marked by the dragon
Can't blame the wires when your heart and mind are laggin'
Arteries are pumping hard by the gallon
Synapses fire like you can't quite imagine
Can't rely on spammin' arrows, part time assassin
Target ice and fire like some dark kind of cannon
Marks cannot hide from he who sees through dragon's eyes
Irises and spyglasses are made of the same matter inside
Harnessing simple geometry
To bring his kill count to ridiculous quantities
Now bodies each side are lying horizontally among the leaves
It's time for some Sakuramochi and a nice hot pot of tea

[Chorus]
Hanzo, the man bow, samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro
Hanzo, the man bow, samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro

[Verse 3]
A lethal bowman, although some say he's a showman
But he could shoot you through a whole length of a road that's Roman
He'd need a moment to grieve and heed the omen
There's a reason that he chose to leave his family clan to join the Creed of Ronin
People know what brothers are like, bickering and quibbling
But it takes a certain kind of special dedication to kill a sibling
Well, Hanzo had to go and do exactly that
And never fully came to terms with that bastard act
Regretted every day, unsatisfied
By the fact that fratricide left a stain through his resume
And no matter what he said or did to repent and pray
He could never take the blemishes away
Like you, when you've been marked by the dragon
Arrow tips split your heart like an atom, look
Sabre toothed tigers never lose sight when the noose tightens, they move silent
Through the moonlight, not too inclined to inquire as to whose side
Are you fighting, should you find this too exciting, I do advise
Keep glued tight to your loose items, I'm rapping-that-fast-that-I-use-hyphens
Better patent that patter in a pattern
As a new type of deep rhyming
Wanna beat it? Huh, please do keep trying

[Chorus]
Hanzo, the man bow, samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro
Hanzo, the man bow, samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows, still life like a Van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo, bringing mojo to the dojo
Raised up as the youngest of heroes, another son of Shojiro

[Outro]
Hanzo (I'm a Hanzo main)
The man bow (I'm a Hanzo main)
Samurai (I'm a Hanzo main)
Commando (Got no mates, I'm a Hanzo main)
Samurai (I'm a Hanzo main)
Commando (I'm a Hanzo main)
The man bow (I'm a Hanzo main)
(Got no mates, I'm a Hanzo main)
