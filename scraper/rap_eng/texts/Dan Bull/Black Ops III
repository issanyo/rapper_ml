[Intro]
World War II was a long time ago
Nowadays things are a little more
Incredible

[Verse 1]
It's the year 2065
The human race is just as wise
But it's had a bit too much to think lately
I don't know if it's fit to drive
We fit the fittest minds with a chip inside
That can link and digitise
That which prior to this
Was higher than science could ever devise
This is a neural interface
We're going to stick it in your face
'til it and your brain are interlaced
There's an arms war on
And we're going to win the race
Leave everything erased
Bring the bass (man)

[Hook]
Man and machine
Weaved like tapestry
Man what a team (machine)
Man and machine
Human minds can't handle the dream

[Verse 2]
Scientific progression is steamrolling
There's no preventing it going ahead
Now we're intrinsically linked with technology
Biology as we know it is dead
Muscle and metal are toiling
I'm not fussed of the kettle is boiling
Just ready the mech, put the oil in
There's a dastardly plot that needs foiling
We are pursuing John Taylor
He and his unit have gone awol
The motive is unclear
But I'm guessing the trope is the one same old
From New Guinea, Peru to Djibouti
Things are getting all boomy and shooty
So gird up your loins and oil your booty
And answer the Call of Duty (man)

[Hook]
Man and machine
Weaved like tapestry
Man what a team (machine)
Man and machine
Human minds can't handle the dream

[Verse 3]
My squad is behind me watching my hiney
Not like that
Blimey
I hide right in plain sight
And I defy thee to try to find me
I see throughâ€‹ the scope with closed eyes
Finger and trigger they both collide
The bullet travels as the crow flies
And a bloke dies
See the ghost rise
Or is it just smoke?
I can't tell from the hell of the drone strikes (bang bang)
Besides I'm preoccupied with fighting
And losing is something I don't like
Sealed with a kiss
Hit you with my steel fist
But it bloody hurts
Cause despite the outside it's my real wrist
Ah, now I'm real pissed
So let me tell you what the deal is
When you deal with me and black ops
You're in for a tough time on the front line
Like Ferguson's black cops (man)

[Hook]
Man and machine
Weaved like tapestry
Man what a team (machine)
Man and machine
Human minds can't handle the dream

Man and machine
Weaved like tapestry
Man what a team (machine)
Man and machine
Human minds can't handle the dream
