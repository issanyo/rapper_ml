[Verse 1]
A dream is nothing
Without a team looking out for you
Pulling you through
In everything you do
Helping you improve
In ways you never knew
Even your most mountainous plans
Are molehills with the helping hands
Of a friend when (wha) you're depending (wha)
On them to attend to the strength of the engine (yeah)
When the pressure is getting to you
They can tell (can tell)
They're a safety valve (valve)
Making sure you're safe and well
Because going it alone isn't the same somehow (nah)
So whatever you campaign
Make sure that you're sharing the champagne (yeah)
So whatever you campaign
Make sure that you're sharing the champagne

[Chorus]
And when the plan changes, every man rages
But nothing can't be fixed with a handshake
Quick (quick), get (get)
Back in control of the mission
Back in the soul of your vision
Back into pole position (one)
Like a racecar
Chasing the greates of grades, A Star
Have faith in the plan for your campaign (yeah)
And when you're done
You can hand me the champagne
(Hand me the champagne)

[Verse 2]
Push off of the block (let's go)
Quick, forward
We're not gonna stop
'Til we're (what?) victorious
Gone in a shot
Pistorius
Everyone who helped me on the way
I missed all of you
So I raise a glass (cheers), as I'm racing past
No time to be slow, though I'm chasing laps (hah)
Acing tracks with amazing raps
So you better have faith in the fact
That my pacing is nothing short of invigorating
Breaking the sound barrier when I say things (whoosh)
A high-speed chase is my plaything (hey)
So if haters are hating
The amount of heed that I pay to what they think (hah)
Is the same as the speed of my steed when I'm braking (woo!)
Straight into the pit stop (hah)
This is hip hop (hah)

Straight into the pit stop (hah)
This is hip hop (ah)
Straight into the pit stop (hah)
This is hip hop (ah)
Let's go!

Carlos has gone and dropped
That rhythm
We're as solid as a rock
Precision
Anybody said we're not
They're kidding
Living in a prison where opinion is fiction
So we kick them off the grid and...
Good riddance
Negativity is explicitly forbidden
So bring some positivity
And then you'll be forgiven
Together we can get ahead
Collectively we're driven

[Chorus]
You and me, we're the key and the ignition
Rev ahead and never get into a collision (quick)
Quick (quick), get (get)
Back in control of the mission
Back in the soul of your vision
Back into pole position (one)
Like a race car (yeah)
Chasing the greatest of grades, A Star
Have faith in the plan for your campaign
And when you're done
You can hand me the champagne
