[Verse 1]
Ramiro Cortez
A hero caught
In the middle of an era of war
Or a dark assassin
With a darker past
Who will start to blast
Before you’re part of the action
Try to match your reaction to him
Don’t make me laugh
You’ll be trash in the bin
How are you going to handle a man
With the stamina to run
From the west of Alaska through Canada?
Who’s up next?
Let’s flip the damn switch
*Click*
And it’s Victor Dantrix
Using military skill to his advantage
Putting a finish
To your tricks and antics
You’re in a bit of a pickle
Fix a sandwich
As I rap so fast
It’s a different language
Vocals roaming the globe when I say
That Stonewall’s only a phone call away
So when

[Hook]
There’s an outbreak
A scourge
Get your weapon drawn
It’s not a metaphor
Better call Echo Squad
There’s an outbreak
A scourge
Get your weapon drawn
It’s not a metaphor
Better call Echo Squad

[Verse 2]
Mass
James Lang
Ex-SAS
If he asks for a hand
Then you best say yes
Scotland is the land that he’s from
And as a result
He can toss you with one hand
I’m referring to cabers
Not glands
The only thing he’s wacking off
Is a shotgun
Solid as a rock man
With a dangerous secret
So you better pray that he keeps it
Tarn’s not the NSA
But if you leak it
Your face’ll need a re-fit
Slapping you
Smack in the face so hard
That the glass of your mask
It’d crack and then shatter
And make those shards
The slow-mo part of the trailer
Your brain’s going to know by heart
Don’t try this at home in a scuffle
You’ll damage the bone in your knuckle
She’s a Russian-American emigrant
Burnt by chemicals
The depression is evident
Mind messed up
Like the pallor of her melanin
Never mind feminine
Never mind heroine
Her enemies better be clever
Whenever they get her
‘cause she’ll end the five
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten of them
You’ll have to find another set
Of hired guys
With the Firefly
It’s like
“bye bye!”

[Hook]
There’s an outbreak
A scourge
Get your weapon drawn
It’s not a metaphor
Better call Echo Squad
There’s an outbreak
A scourge
Get your weapon drawn
It’s not a metaphor
Better call Echo Squad

Failure is not an option
