[Intro]
December the 25th is here
0.003% of a year
December the 25th is here
So we should shine a light on those who might just disappear

[Verse 1]
There's so much hype for the 25th of December
Piles of cards to write, lists of gifts to remember
That we're quick to forget, amidst the tinsel and splendour
That in the end we're in it together
So I've picked up a pen and written a letter
But it isn't to Santa
Though it is a wishlist of things I think we should remember
Of thinkers, inventors, figures and mentors
And different events linked to the 25th of December, listen:
William the Conqueror was crowned the King of England
Ukraine chose to leave the Soviet Union
In ancient Rome was Charlemagne's coronation
Later, the Kingdom of Hungary's foundation
Hong Kong succumbed to Japanese occupation
The Soviet Union saw Gorbachev's resignation
Christmas Island found by Captain William Mynors
The adoption of The Constitution of the Republic of China
This is for Isaac Newton, I salute him
The guy who kickstarted the scientific revolution
Helena Rubinstein, Polish-American businesswoman
They're all omitted with this discussion of Christmas coming
Isn't it something?
And if you're into cricket
Happy birthday Trescothick, Hasan, Jones, Cook and Grimmet
Let's remember Quentin Crisp, Lady Morgan Sydney
Orlando Gibbons, Jinnah, Robert Ripley
The day that comedy died, this isn't happening
First W. C. Fields, then Charlie Chaplin
This is for Hugo Bergmann and Dorothy Wordsworth
The German Nobel laureates Ruska, Windaus and Herzberg
From generousness to effortless cleverness
Respect to Annie Lennox, Noel Redding, Kenny Everett
The efforts and achievements real people do
Whether or not they succeed
Rest in peace, Beagle 2
Here's looking at you, admidst the stars I have to thank you
Tip my hat to Humphrey Bogart, the star of Casablanca
From Cab Calloway through to Louis Chevrolet
There's plenty more we ought to make sure we don't forget today

[Chorus]
Love you
We love you
Love you
We love you, love you
Love you
We love you
Love you
We love you

[Verse 2]
Not many of us have a larger heart than
The founder of the American Red Cross, Clara Barton
So I beg your pardon for any omission
Whether you're a secularist or whether you're Christian
Whatever religion, whatever your differences
We're distant relatives so let us mend the division
Within gender, we're more than just men and just women
We may be different races but we're genetically kin and
We may be different ages but we still live
In the same seconds and minutes
No one's setting the limits
So let's end the tradition of splitting hairs
'Cause the fission of follicles just isn't logical
Remember the mission
We're in it together

[Chorus]
We love you
Love you
We love you, love you
Love you
We love you
Love you
We love you, love you

Love you (love you)
We love you
Love you (love you)
We love you, love you
Love you (love you)
We love you
Love you (love you)
We love you
