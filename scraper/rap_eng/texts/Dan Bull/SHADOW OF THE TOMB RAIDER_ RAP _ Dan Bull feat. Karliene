(Karliene)
Go Deeper, Go deeper
Into the shadow, Into the shadow
Go darker, go farther
Into the shadow, into the shadow

(Dan Bull)
Come and take a seat by the fire
'Til the heat stirs secret desires
To seek the entire world
For the missing pieces you require
To find peace, Inner quiet
Sun hidden, In the shadow of a blood moon
Man, I hope the sunup's going to come soon
Consuming everything it brushes up against
'Til the monsoon washes off all of our sufferance
Paid for our sins with a sacrificial offering
The human body's just a sack with some offal in
But it's sacred 'cause all nature is
Maintain it well, It'll be ageless
Women in games are often make up and nail polish
Hardly ever caked in mud, stuck in a rain forest
Lara remains honest, You can bet your wains on it
She'll never betray confidantes or break promises

Tomb raider the tomb invades your brain
Get in her way and she'll make you taste the pain

(Karliene)
Go deeper go deeper
Into the shadow into the shadow
Go darker Go farther
Into the shadow Into the shadow
You've traveled so far
Now go further Now go further
You've wandered so far
Now go further Into the shadow

(Dan bull)
Don't look Into the light
Obscured by the dark you can't rely on your sight
Don't look into the sun
Keep on running forward from where you had begun

This is mesoamerica
No slipping
It'll make a hell of a mess If you miss a step
No tripping
Blood dripping on the stone I said no slipping
Go tell somebody else this was ghostwritten
Look this isn't just uncharted
The woman's edit Nicole Arbour isn't Lara
Give her some credit
Lara Croft's a true original figure
She stands alone
Definitely not a clone of Indiana Jones
Definitely never called Lara Cruz
And then anglicized and given massive boobs
For you to fantasize
But now if you've an appetite
For human sacrifice
The newest title in the franchise is glad to provide

Ms. Croft its been hell of a ride
And as a brit toff
I'm brimming, swelling with pride
Yeah this is tip top but unless I've made a mistake
You've been ripped off
By some fellow named Nathan Drake

Tomb Raider the tune invades your brain
Get in her way and she'll make you taste the pain

(Karliene)
Go deeper Go deeper
Into the shadow Into the shadow
Go darker Go farther
Into the shadow Into the shadow
You've traveled so far
Now go further Now go further
You've wandered so far
Now go further Into the shadow

(Dan Bull)
Dont look into the light
Obscured by the dark you can't rely on your sight
Dont look into the sun
Keep on running forward from where you had begun

(Karliene)
Go deeper Go deeper
Into the shadow into the shadow
Go darker Go farther
Into the shadow Into the shadow
