[Intro]
Dan Bull: Oi, Shizzy!
Shizzy: Yeah?
Dan Bull: Rap battle? Super Smash Brothers?
Shizzy: Red
Dan Bull: Sorted

[VI Seconds]
Look, you've been invited to the battlefield of war
With a cast of characters I'm sure you have all seen before
I'm the Master Hand from smacking you, I'm snatching up your score
Ganon to the Dorf, slamming to the floor, kats I'm packing up for sure
Trophy on my shelf after Yoshi loses his health
Eating like Wario, I gradually loosen my belt
Cuz I get a tad gassy after having devoured
Competitors for an hour, more boss than Bowser

[Dan Bull]
I'm a bad mother, the master of Super Smash Brothers
True fact, don't believe me? Then you can ask others
Got fond memories of smashing them like past lovers
So amass your gang together for the Last Supper
I'll hack and slash them like a beam sword through a pack of butter
I'm heavyweight rolling through like a fat trucker
Slap daft buggers from behind like a back scrubber
Give you a palette swap, to blue and black colours

[VI Seconds]
Back brother
Venues get ripped for days
Powerful, like Skull Kid, I'll flip the stage
It won't take a Final Smash from me to bring you D-Day
I'll just wind up and punch your lights out like DK
(What did he say?) You never heard someone mad before?
Murdering anyone ever to make it, like the Master Core?
If you're taking a minute to battle it's easy
Break the controller, blast your TV
That'll be way better off for your health
It'll be worse if you ever did see me

[Hook: Dan Bull]
Smash! Smash!
Brother, smash! Smash!
You better dash! Dash!
Brother, dash! Dash!
Or you'll get smashed! Smash!
Brother, smash! Smash!
You better dash! Dash!
Brother, dash! Dash!
Or you'll get smashed!

[Dan Bull]
Do you want to demolish this jaunty song?
Take me on one v one, I'll prove you promptly wrong
You're an iddy biddy little Diddy, I'm a Donkey Kong
I'm a Fazioli grand piano, you're a Honky Tonk
Is it bad form to smack you off the platform
So hard your head cracks open like a Smash Ball?
My home run bat will smack you through the back door
So hard you'll be like: "Ow, what you do that for?"

[VI Seconds]
Spitting that fire and bringing you hell
Chillin' in first? I got a Blue Shell
Go tell ya momma and go tell ya gramma
If they play too, I'm swinging a hammer
I'm taking no damage I'm holding the star
And I'm more of a star than a Luma with bars
A legend in fact you can ask about him
I'll burn you like punches from Captain Falcon

[Dan Bull]
I'll cook and saut√© you 'til we need some more players
What's fun is four players, as fun as foreplay is
I ain't got beef with you, you little Pikachu
But come and see me on the stage if you're eager to
You'll see the truth, the reason for my fame
When I finish you, what can I say but "Game."

[Hook]
Smash! Smash!
Brother, smash! Smash!
You better dash! Dash!
Brother, dash! Dash!
Or you'll get smashed! Smash!
Brother, smash! Smash!
You better dash! Dash!
Brother, dash! Dash!
Or you'll get smashed!

[Outro: Dan Bull]
