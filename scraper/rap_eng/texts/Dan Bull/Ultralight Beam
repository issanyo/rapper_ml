[Intro]
Ladies and Gentlemen
Welcome to the start of the greatest album of all time
The Life of Pablo

(a one, a two, a one, two, three, four)

[Verse]
Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
Ultra, ultra, ultralight beam

Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
Ultralight beam, ultralight beam
An ultralight beam ain't what it seems
And if you're not down in my team then you're leem
And by leem I mean lame but it didn't quite rame
It didn't quite rhyme, I'm in the right frame of mind
Eh
