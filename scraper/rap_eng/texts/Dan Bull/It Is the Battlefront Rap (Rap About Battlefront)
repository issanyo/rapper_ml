[Verse 1]
A long time ago in a galaxy far away
A battle between son and father raged
The dad represented an empire of hate
While the son's side brought light
To erase the dark away
What?! Feel the beat drop, like a rock
That an Ewok dropped from a treetop
You be lost like Luke on his Tauntaun
Man, he should have probably took a TomTom
It's getting Hoth in here
So put on all your clothes
Before you're froze
Cold as ice like my hardboiled prose
Hip hop C-3PO, fluent in six million flows
Oh no, I'm a rap Han Solo
Backpack Jedi Master YOLO
No fool, old school like Yoda
Fly in a Vauxhall Supernova
Souped up chunk of metal, son
Revving and ready for the Kessel Run
Hey matey! Your AT-AT's slower than AT&T
I could have ate tea at the age of eighty
And still evade Vader's late fleet
When I aim I can read your mind
Make your speeder bike and a tree colide
Ow, there's a leak in your trousers
I've got a bad feeling about this

[Hook]
May the Force be with you
May the Dark Lord forgive you
Anakin Skywalker, beat slamming
Like a car door, sir!
You're comic, I'm a Dark Horse
This is Star Wars!

[Verse 2]
Between me and you there's business
Bigger than Lucas and Disney's
Like Luke I was born to do this
I've used the Force and torn
Through the stormtroopers
All you noobs are sore losers
You scruffy looking nerf herders
Motherfuckers deserve murder
I smash my rivals! Snatch the title
Look at my blaster rifle (PEW!)
Splat your eyeball!
Peep through the binoculars
See the future of oculus
I'm the Boba Fett of the net
But I've not got any offers yet
I'm not respected enough
Cos I go over your head like a hover jet
I got it in the pocket, you're a rookie
I rip your arm out the socket like a Wookie
Look here, I'm a new rapper
Half computer half Chewbacca
You're not that bad but you lack heart
Mon Calamari, tell them Admiral Ackbar
Set traps so you better get back
When I'm strapped with a jetpack necks snap
So get from the back to the front
Pick a faction and fuck shit up, Battlefront
So get from the back to the front
Pick a faction and fuck shit up, Battlefront

[Hook]
May the Force be with you
May the Dark Lord forgive you
Anakin Skywalker, beat slamming
Like a car door, sir!
You're comic, I'm a Dark Horse
This is Star Wars!
