[Verse 1]
I'm Geralt of Rivia
Could I be pithier
While ripping through the fibulas and tibias of idiots?
There isn't a living thing I couldn't kill at all
Kill them all with a silver sword
No wonder Vizima built that wall
Whether Golem, Vodnick, Godling, Foglet, Doppler, Cockatrice, Dog, or Botchling
Warg or Chort or Forktail
You all fail
Ghouls and wolves
I pull a Werewolf by his tail
Drown the Devil by the Well
Burn the Dragon of Fyresdal
Wild white wolves and Wyverns fight Cyclops and Sirens
Nightwraiths, Hybrids and Hyms and Ice Giants
Seems these beasts are very keen to be seen in the bestiary
Venomous, more than a bee sting
Know what I mean Emreis?

For monsters I use a steel will and silver sword, done
And for man I use a steel sword and a silver tongue

[Verse 2]
I'm built hard to deal with Nilfgaard
I'm real scarred
And I will kill even when I spar with guards
But it's the children of the wilderness I'm skilled with killing
When I'm not chilling
Getting my fill of different women
Well, I have it out with Alghouls and Howlers
Gargoyles and Drowners
Nithral, Trolls, Hounds, D'ao, Salma, Devourers
Lamias, Harpies, Sarastis and Rotfiends and Ogres and Crones
Hurting Kernun, Beserkers, Shriekers, Beasts and Ghosts
Nekker, Necrophage, Specter, Pesta, Pest or Penitent
Relict, Imp, Bear or Djinn, Therazane or Eredin
Elementa, Leshen, Endregas and Ekimmaras
While I meditate and wait, you'll never see tomorrow
Plague Maidens and Wraiths, Graveirs, and Grave Hags
Cave Trolls, White Ladies and Wham-A-Whams
Water Hag, Morvuud, Tangleores and Ekhidnas
Pull apart Mourntarts, Shriekers, Fiends and Mucknixers
Imlerith, Ifrits, Spirits, and Speartips and Griffins
From Katakan to Basilisk and frickin' itchy Midges
Imagine Guybrush Threepwood meets Clint Eastwood
I wish a beast would
It'd be ploughing reet good
