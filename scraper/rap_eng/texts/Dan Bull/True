Listen to me on this one

[Verse 1: Beit Nun]
If I'm not stuck in the office then I'm pushing a product
Trying to recover my losses as I struggle to profit off it
But once I drop it they're on it
Ready to blog it so you don't have to spend a penny to cop it
Then you question why Ben isn't dropping an album
Of songs that he's proud of, disregarding probable outcomes
Do you not know the cost of running a house
And pressing a couple thousand records up?
Judging by that look on your mug I'm doubtful
But I love this enough to plough on
And putting my money where my mouth is is somethin' I'm proud of
I see you watching me through net curtains
So you must know that I'm pushing and networking, putting the leg work in
Beit is hungry and dead certain
That he isn't done until there's hundreds of heads turning
My best verses are still unwritten...
So you can't write me off yet mate, it's worth the wait for you to sit and listen

Beit Nun

Not a chance I'll be giving up on this, man

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
Dan Bull
The scene's looking at me with a screw face
I've been lucky recently - my YouTube page
Has taken off at a phenomenally huge rate
But for every new fan there's a new hater
Who never knew Dan but claims "You've changed
What's with these upbeat tunes, you need to redo Safe!"
So what, you think I'm going to say "touch√©"
Stop making track for me, to do what you say?
You do not know me like I do my mates
I was in a comedy rock group in my youthful days
But you want honesty? K, I need to lose weight
A new wardrobe and a new tube of toothpaste
See, I stay true daily to the music
Never lose faith or move away from my roots
If you're tuned into my wavelength or frequency
You'll do away with expectations, see me for me
See that I'm a work in progress, giving no less than my best
I'm not just blessed, I got better with my blood and sweat
So whether you think I'm a gimmick act or not
Listen to my back catalogue, and tell me that I'm not
One of the sickest of rappers
Ripping the tracks up with amazing flows and lyrics
Bringing it back to genuine rap
So much I basically overdid it
I'm over the limit
Going for the winning position, I hope to get it
By totally killing the competition
With songs I'm bringing, I live it

[Verse 3: RedEye]
Yah
My mums tells me that I cuss too much
My pops says that I think through my nuts too much
Girl tells me that I'm slipping, and I've lost my touch
Late nights on the snake bites rots my guts
My brain tells me that I cane too hard
My mindframe is in pain, my mentality's scarred
Landlord has just rejected my Barclaycard
I've got two days to pay, or vacate my yard. Allow it
I've been around the block; fucked about a lot
Fuck the penny, I'm still waiting for the pound to drop
See it's a struggle, trying to hustle for the next pound
Sick of getting stressed out, life is just a let down
See I've been rhyming for a number of years, ain't had a
Bit of success, but watched it come to my peers, so check it...
Now's my time to make the bottle go pop
And ain't gonna stop or give it up until I get to the top
So just watch me
