[Intro]
We'll never be on our own, all alone
And me and my team, far from home, in places unknown
So if you wanna holla me

[Verse 1: Jay Madden]
The only one without earning the green
Learning the trade, determined to make a permanent wage
Rhymin' words of the grey, my further mistake
Is dedicate working with mates, to a girlfriends that will turn em away
Days before the albums nearly been made
It's such a clich√©, urban debate
But more than one person can take, they're straight jerking my chain
The rage hurting my brain, with internal terminal pain
There's certain names that I learn to refrain from hurting
To the point I nearly burst into flames
I'm so controvertibly drained, it's absurd they display such animosity
To the same people you might have had heard of today
But what's it worth the [? 1:04] wait, to emerge and escape this circle
So sick of regurgitating my verbal of hate
I'm certain the day I make it affirmative
Jay will still be dripping in the learning curve of the wave, because

[Chorus]
Me and my team, we're hard to follow
Pound for pound we ain't playing around so bet your bottom dollar
That we're gonna mission like Gucci awalla walla gonna
Bang bang a boot into beats so if you wanna holla me
'Cause me and my team, we're hard to follow
Pound for pound we ain't playing around so bet your bottom dollar
That we're gonna mission like Gucci walla walla gonna
Bang bang a boot into beats so if you wanna holla me

[Verse 2: Chris Leese]
Yeah, it seems like everybody raps now, damn wow
Another artist with a wack style letting his fucking pants down
No quality control, they're forcing crappy tracks out
That's half the reason this countries' scene is under a black cloud
When I started rappin', they haven't invented Twitter yet
Noone had heard of 50 cent, nobody had the internet
Cross country no sat-nav, going to gigs with friends
Grabbing an open mic and spitting your best to get a bigger rep
That's how I met Jay, face to face on stage battling
Spitting freestyle, doing this shit the right way
Now we are a forced to be reckoned with any record's representatives
Glorious penmanship, put more thought into your sentences
That's all, this is effortless, my thoughts and attempts have forced me
To form a formula that's taller than Everest
Let me pause for a second if you caught the impression
Chris fucking cared about hip-hop anymore, then forget this shit

[Chorus]
Me and my team, we're hard to follow
Pound for pound we ain't playing around so bet your bottom dollar
That we're gonna mission like Gucci walla walla gonna
Bang bang a boot into beats so if you wanna holla me
'Cause me and my team, we're hard to follow
Pound for pound we ain't playing around so bet your bottom dollar
That we're gonna mission like Gucci walla walla gonna
Bang bang a boot into beats so if you wanna holla me

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
I never wanted an office job, got pissed off
With every word that came out of my boss's gob (shut up)
So I took hold of the chain around my neck and chopped it off
I'm a pitbull, not a sausage dog
Look, I'd never get satisfaction from jack-less rapping (nah)
And I'd never get jack for rapping without a plan of action
So I sat and had to my craft with practice
'Til I knew for a fact my musical tactics were matchless (ha)
Made and album about my desire to be deprived of life
So no one in their right mind would hire me for a nine to five (nah)
Now my life was on the line, I didn't have a choice
It was just me, my lyrics and my voice (rah)
If I didn't succeed I would live in the streets, hungry (hah)
So I didn't have a choice but to be hungry
So come and try to take my dream from me
I'm not being funny but I'll leave you in a worse state than Ian Huntley

We'll never be on our own, all alone
And me and my team, far from home, in places unknown

[Chorus]
Me and my team, we're hard to follow
Pound for pound we ain't playing around so bet your bottom dollar
That we're gonna mission like Gucci walla walla gonna
Bang bang a boot into beats so if you wanna holla me
'Cause me and my team, we're hard to follow
Pound for pound we ain't playing around so bet your bottom dollar
That we're gonna mission like Gucci walla walla gonna
Bang bang a boot into beats so if you wanna holla me
