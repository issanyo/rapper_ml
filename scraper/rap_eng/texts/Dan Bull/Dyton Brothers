[Verse]
Look
Pay attention
It's the Dyton Brothers
When they rarely follow the rule
"Be nice to others" (hah)
They leave behind a big pile of frightened buggers
Who are hiding under the bed, they're behind the covers
At the back of the sofa
Or inside the cupboards
And just tremble at the mention of the Dyton Brothers

(Boom)
Aaah
Run for cover (ha-hah)
You're looking for a fight
It's the Dyton Brothers (aaah)
Oooh
Run for cover
If you really need a poo
It's the Dyton Brothers (ha-hah)

[Outro]
Goodbye, [? 0:31]
Mwahaha
Woo-hoh
