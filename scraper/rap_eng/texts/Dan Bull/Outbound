[Intro]
May I be allowed to voice my opinion to you
Today I feel like I made a choice
And now there's no turning back

[Verse 1]
Isn't it great when you're a failure in life
And all that you've aimed for's gone away from your sights
Whilst your top eight mates are plain sailing through life
It's grey when you're bright but unable to quite
Make it through the day without evading the strife
I stay awake through the nights, lay in wait for the light
Brain vacant despite the debates in my mind
Like maybe my plane may have strayed from its flight
Failed to pervade and faded from the sky
Dan Bull's a candle with no flame to ignite
It's painful to write, I strain just to type
A page full of lines and I've drained all my pride
Eyes dry, I'm unable to cry
Time flies and I trail behind
You may say it's my fault, maybe you're right
Maybe it's myself to blame for my plight

[Hook]
I overdose and close my eyes
'Til I'm comatose and slowly rise
Over rows of roads and signs
Flows, tides froze in time
From lows to highs until there's only skies
No lonely lives cloaked in phony lies
No disguise, the skies are open wide
It goes as no surprise
No surprises, no alarms
No-one cries, I'm going calmly

[Verse 2]
I'm dazed, I seem to spend my days in a daydream
I've been this way way before the day I was eighteen
Haters say to me I waste the space to breathe
Wait for the train to Leeds with my claims in my case and leave
Please, believe me, I'd say I agree
Let them eat cake? I'll take it and eat it
Jeez, even taking a beating's a great deal easier
Than waking up each day in a place full of fears
And praying for amnesia with a faceful of tears
The pain's so severe that it aches and it sears
Peel away the veneer, the real state's revealed
I've been patient for years, just waiting to hear
Someone say that it's OK, that I'm safe cos they're here
But it's blatantly clear that that day's nowhere near
I hate to tempt fate but I'd be grateful for either
The faith of a believer or to fade away and disappear

[Hook]
I overdose and close my eyes
'Til I'm comatose and slowly rise
Over rows of roads and signs
Flows, tides froze in time
From lows to highs until there's only skies
No lonely lives cloaked in phony lies
No disguise, the skies are open wide
It goes as no surprise
No surprises, no alarms
No-one cries, I'm going calmly

[Verse 3]
So I'm closing my curtains and making my bed
Cos no-one on earth knows the pain in my head
No-one knows of the hurt or the strain or the dread
Though I'm over the worst I can't face things ahead
I'm escaping instead, I'm leaving this place
Erasing my thread and I'm cleaning my slate
Safe now I've fled, serene and sedate
There's no waking the dead when they beam into space
I've seen into space, shaken hands with the stars
And the feeling's great when you're landing on Mars
Dreamy and weightless in ambient dark
Only hearing the sweetness of transient harps
With my hand on my heart I assure you it's bliss
Soaring back to the starkness before you existed
Before you were born, before you were kissed
Before you were torn from the immortal abyss

[Hook]
I overdose and close my eyes
'Til I'm comatose and slowly rise
Over rows of roads and signs
Flows, tides froze in time
From lows to highs until there's only skies
No lonely lives cloaked in phony lies
No disguise, the skies are open wide
It goes as no surprise
No surprises, no alarms
No-one cries, I'm going calmly

[Outro]
I'm at the last act
No now amount of dark can harm me
