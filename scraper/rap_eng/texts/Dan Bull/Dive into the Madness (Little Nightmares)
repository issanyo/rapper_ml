[Intro]
Ooh, I say

[Verse 1]
Deep down, down below the waves
Is a foreboding place
From which you won't escape
No, those who go there go to stay
Below the ocean spray
Who knows your fate
A little lassie in an overcoat
Stowed away
Six is at a precocious age
Or so they say
Don't they?
If she was any younger
Six would have succumbed to hunger by now
Is it any wonder?
I wonder
Why we're frightened of lightning and thunder
Sneaking around
Feet on the ground
Never even making a peep or a sound

[Hook 1]
Dive into the madness
Try swimming through miasmic blackness
Dive into the madness
Seasick from the spinning of the atlas
Ooh, I say
You gave me a fright there
I thought I was having a little nightmare
Ooh, I say
You gave me a fright there
So scared that I might get white hair

[Verse 2]
Strange shadows are disguised in the bright glare
Where did she hide?
She was right there
I swear
I glare with a wide eyed stare
At the site where I spied her
My girl
I hope you're strapped up tight in your high chair
I'm not adequately providing childcare
How well you might fare
If only I would fight fair
In my spare time I like to strike fear
Into the hearts of the horrid little children
Let's be honest, then
I'm probably going to kill them
Chop them
Chuck them
Lob them off a building
Do you really need the details filled in?
Entrails spilled and boiled into goop
Seasoned with herbs and then served as a soup
Feeding the mouths of the greediest guests
Look and see for yourself
It's easy queasy to digest

[Hook 2]
Ooh, I say
You gave me a fright there
What a sickening sight
That's quite rare
Ooh, I say
You gave me a fright there
I thought I was having a little nightmare
Dive into the madness
Vanishing the line dividing good and badness
You can only hide under your mattress
Til' you need to resupply your lighters and matches

[Verse 3]
You can be sure that in the jaws of the maw
You're going to come out looking like you've fought in the war
Mauled with the paw of the polar bear
Halt hold it there
All fall to the floor
You're insulting the law
And the ball's in my court
Don't run
There's little point bolting the door
When I'm holding a saw
And patrolling for gore
My depravity gland's all swollen and sore
You find that revolting I'm sure
I don't care
I'll shove you through a revolving door
I wrote the rules down here
And all I am concerned with
Is fear
Dive into the madness
Dive into the madness now
Dive into the madness
Dive into the madness now
Dive into the madness
Dive into the madness now
Dive into the madness
