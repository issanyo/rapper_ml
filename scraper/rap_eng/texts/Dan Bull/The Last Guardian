[Intro: Dan Bull]
We spoke unspoken things
We rode on broken wings
We wrote a symphony with broken bows and broken strings
We harmonized to bring each other simple hope from hymns
We spoke unspoken things
We rode on broken wings

[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
I still remember the day that I met you
To begin with, I didn't quite get you
And I bet you didn't get me
When you sneezed and I said bless you
Remember the days of getting acquainted
We were chained together with pain
But yet its the same tether that made a friendship
That no oppressor could tame
We severed the chain
Shedding the weight
And made a clever escape
Through terrible weather and flame
Frayed fur and feathers never the same
Together we celebrate
Commiserate
Share treasure and blame
By any given measure you make
We're the best the better the best of mates

We spoke unspoken things
We rode on broken wings
We wrote a symphony with broken bows and broken strings
We harmonized to bring eachother simple hope from hymns
Akin to lowly folk and kings sharing a token drink
Opening a link once closed
To simply sit like bros and sing
We broke the mould
And showed the whole world what we both can bring
But a pin that's soaked in ink
And poked in skin can only sting
Like broken bones, broken oaths or broken wings

[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]
So just carry me and I'll lead you
Shelter me and I'll feed you
Hear me and I'll see you through
Together we do whatever we need to do

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
I still remember the day that I met you
To begin with, I didn't quite get you
And I bet you didn't get me
When I leaned in with an attempt to pet you

But with you I'm not scared to share the real me
Just knowing you care can heal me
I swear fealty
Can you feel me?
I'll be a sword if you shield me
Might never get a chance to say goodbye
When its too late you're gone
We two may be separated
But it's you that made me one

When I'm away please stay strong
Remember what it takes to break these bonds
Place oceans and seas between us
They'll seem like lakes and ponds
I care about your whereabouts
I'm bare without you
Share yourself with me
Feel free to dare to doubt
I swear I'm there to help

My prayers go out to thee
You're tearing down the scary towers
Bearing down
And staring out
And glaring down at me
There's no bounds to what were amounting to
To what you and a pal can do
Insurmountable mountains
Become minuscule mounds
When we meld as two

I keep the principles you held us to (always)
And they help us through
Still here when I'm out of view
That chill you felt I felt it too
That chill you felt I felt it too
So

[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]
Carry me and I'll lead you
Shelter me and I'll feed you
Hear me and I'll see you through
Together we do whatever we need to do
Together we do whatever we need to do
