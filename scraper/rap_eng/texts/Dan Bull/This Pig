Born to a sow and a boar
His childhood was happy but his parents were so very poor
Wanted his own family
So he bought up a sty in the big city

But look at him now
He's being taken away
Never again will he see
The light of day

This pig had a white collar job and a big blue car
This pig got a one way ticket to an abbatoir
This pig was not so different from you and me
This pig was served in light pastry for tea

He wanted piglets and a pretty wife
And all the riches of a happy and meaningful life
But he never got that chance
And all because you wouldn't eat just plants

But look at him now
He's being taken away
Next time you see him
He'll be pâté

This pig had a white collar job and a big blue car
This pig got a one way ticket to an abbatoir
This pig was not so different from me and you
This pig had his brain mashed into goo

Ooh

This pig had a white collar job and a big blue car
This cow was going to be a bovine superstar
This sheep; this fish; this lamb; this goose; this duck
You ate them all, you heartless fuck

Yeah
