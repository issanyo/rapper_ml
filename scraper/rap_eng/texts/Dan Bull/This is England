The 1980s was a time of strife
The Falklands War, the miners' strikes
The poor got poorer
While all of the fat cats had the time of their life
Now Shaun was a troubled lad
Who could have had a family, could have had a mum and dad
But his dad went away and wasn't coming back
And he just wanted someone to understand that fact
And that's exactly what happened one day in a dank underpass
It'd come to pass that some cunts were laughing
At his mum's fashion and he'd had enough of that
He come across a couple of lads
Having a chuckle that asked him what was up? What's the matter?
So he told them the answer
And they brightened him right up with their banter
Til Gadget come back with a grudge and some cans and demanded
"budge or I'll batter you"
So Shaun goes home alone
He knows the ropes of the fuckery that's happening
He roams the lonely roads and knows there's no-one to trust and be happy with
But next day there's a tap on the pane of his glass
It came from the path and it's Gadget
He's asking if Shaun wants to play
But Shaun isn't sure what to say
Woody wants to know would he want to go because he's sorry for the other day
Boys will be boys, buildings destroyed with military toys
The voiceless youth amused by noise, abuse
Let Loose, an excuse to avoid the truth
Loosen the noose for a moment
'til they have to go home to a home that's hopeless
New shoes just won't cut it
You want to let your hair down? go and cut it
A new suit, boots and braces, new mates to play with, share the pain with
Parents hate it, scared of changes
And letting their little tearaways get away with it
They're at an age where they'll go to parties
And be exposed to the harsh things
It's hard being dark seeing as the friends of your friends are incredibly right wing
He can't mean what he says, he's a mate but
He's asking you whether you're Jamaican or English
Because your skin's different to his
He considers you insidious
Then shit begins to get serious
How did we get here to this?
Giving a talk on the British and forces
Being killed in the war in the Falklands
Then Shaun took a swing at him all because this was the war where he nearly was orphaned
Awful things happen, you have to draw a line, with a choice to walk away or stay behind
Combo saw what the naked eye couldn't
The pain inside Shaun that made him ripe
For the patriots' fight for the land
So he made them shake hands and say goodbye
Sad, but it must be. It was time to take a drive, and travel the country
And after the National Front meet
Sean got moved from the back to the front seat
Truly one of the gang and a thug, see
That's when things really began to get ugly
Tagging profanities in backstreets
Bashing Pakistanis and black peeps
Threatening to slash cheeks
A new flag and a tat on the back of the hand, That's for keeps
Our protagonist seems to have forgotten how to ask for sweets
These acts in the past were petty
But who can backchat to a machete
Brandished by an angry fascist heavy?
"put that away Meggy, your ass is sweaty"
Gadge and the lads grabbed fags and bevvies, cans of Pepsi
Ran back Through the entry, left the shop totally messy
Adrenaline sent Combo in a frenzy
Head red, heart hopeless and empty
It's a headwreck why folks are unfriendly
To people of a different origin
Cos what has skin got to do with it, we're all wandering
Through the shit
The human condition is truly a mission for a lunatic to live in
So we stick to wishing each other well
As long as we think that they're wishing it as well
That's why they gave the Asian living hell
Before baking a cake now they're giving it to Smell
Skins have relationship issues as well
And given the days he's been living in a cell
Can you blame Combo for his difficulties now?
There isn't much to dwell on for prisoners but how long
Until they're coming out
But I tell you this, getting blitzed isn't really gonna help...
Sitting in a flat getting fried with a black guy
Issues in the back of your mind as he acts like
He's got everything you never had and wish you did
Rubbing it in your face, who is this kid
Immigrant from another race taking British priviliges
A nigga, ripping the piss
Gonna give him a kick in the face
A bit of discipline'll stick him in his place, a sickening disgrace
Beat him senseless; he's defenceless
Leave your friend bleeding, please just end this
Immediately the grief and regret sets in
Left one of your best friends with his head Decked in
You better get checked in to the A and E
Lock yourself up, chuck away the Key
When the world's on your shoulders you've got to be a soldier because
Real men don't cry
Real men don't cry
