[Intro: Dan Bull]
I still remember the day the frost descended
It was the end of empty threats
From a God who must have meant it
We must have crossed a deity whom our greed and lust offended
And upon whose plentiful benevolence each of us depended

[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
The biting chill swept across the lofty life we'd built
'Til mighty buildings were left crushed to look like tiny hills
The frost lifted up the rock exposing all society's ills
Those we tried not to think about for what we might reveal
We set a course and travelled forth to grab resources
From the shrapnel of oil tankers and man of war ships
Battle forces we hadn't planned to have a war with at all before
But now we have a lack of choice
This is the new reality, a gloomy anarchy looming
Held in the hand of one human, who is that man? It's me
Can't say I feel proud, this doesn't warrant vanity
The looking glass is frosted over and we cannot see
So we place our faith and hope and dreams in smoke and steam
I mean, why would we go to those extremes if we don't believe
So hunker down and dig in for the coldest winter tide
Since you convinced your prideful self that you've nothing to hide

[Chorus: The Stupendium]
The wheels of progress frozen motionless
Unless we thaw all these unspoken spokes
Then death is coming home
The wheels of progress frozen motionless
Unless we thaw all these unspoken spokes
Well then we're going home

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
Ever since the first of us huddled round the fire
With nothing to hide, but animal hides as attire
Our entire world was centred and dependent on supplies of carbon
The new oxygen that we require to respire
We pampered life's complexities, manufactured luxuries
While suffocating nature's lungs when we cut the trees
Now our comeuppance seems to be to huddle round the fire
With everything to hide and animal hides as attire
What goes around will come around, whatever's underground
Will come up now you're not expecting it and damn well hunt you down
So hunker down and dig in for the coldest winter tide
Since you convinced your prideful self that you've nothing to hide

[Chorus: The Stupendium]
The wheels of progress frozen motionless
Unless we thaw all these unspoken spokes
Then death is coming home
The wheels of progress frozen motionless
Unless we thaw all these unspoken spokes
Well then we're going home

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
Our stomachs are the furnaces, our open throats the chimney
Our hearts the flowing pumps that need the bellow lungs to bring heat
But our brittle bodies are a pitiful device
Trying to subsist upon a trickle of supplies
With the vittles diminishing I don't think it will suffice
Although species evolve quicker when it's difficult to thrive
But that theory isn't something that always applies
Deprive us enough, we'll suffer our inevitable demise
We are each expendable but the city must survive
It's just a pleasant bonus if it keeps us alive
So hunker down and dig in for the coldest winter tide
Since you convinced your prideful self that you've nothing to hide

[Chorus: The Stupendium]
The wheels of progress frozen motionless
Unless we thaw all these unspoken spokes
Then death is coming home
The wheels of progress frozen motionless
Unless we thaw all these unspoken spokes
Well then we're going home
