[Verse 1]
I got your cards that you bought me, ignored them
Because I thought calling would cause me a boredom
And of course I'm ashamed to admit
That every birthday wished me further away
From your midst 'til I couldn't face taking the risk
I guess I lost my faith a little bit
But then I realised a fundamental basic
More than any other you encouraged me to be creative
So it might quite belated, but I love you, Margaret and David

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
You were with me in my first days
But then I shut myself away during the worst days
A half-baked reason why I'm worth cake
But now evelen star birthday is part of my wordplay
And you bought me a calligraphy set
I'm ashamed to say I haven't done calligraphy yet
I was a little perplexed and treated with neglect
And yet now I make my living fiddling with text
Some of your gifts still bring back images
The little set of carve farmyard miniatures
The tree was my favourite piece
And it still is when I play with my niece
So yeah, I've done myself a favour at least
Now I'm back on the rails and I'm taming the beast
In a similar way to how my birthday cake did
It's time for you two to be celebrated
So it might be quit belated, but I love you, Margaret and David

[Chorus]
The Kelsey Bears
The Kelsey Bears
The Kelsey Bears

[Verse 3]
Photography was obviously a hobby each of you wanted me to do
I never got into it properly
But now I love it, kind of like a kid with broccoli
My tastes took time to develop in the dark room
And now I can't do without it, honestly
You offered an option and I made you feel you'd been forgotten
Now the season's hot and Evesham's lost
Some leaves and blossoms but let's speak a little
Let's speak a little more often

[Chorus]
The Kelsey Bears
The Kelsey Bears
