[Verse 1]
I am Aiden and I reside inside of the mind
Or right by the side of the life that I have been tied with
I’m a violent type of vibrant light
That scientists have tried to describe
Since I was thrown along with Jodie
The only one to know me
Disowned by her folks to a zone so lonely
Caged for precaution, strange little orphan
She has a knack for actions, replacing the talking
We give a demonstration to Nathan Dawkins
But all it takes is for Clayton to walk in
The situation changes
I may need a forfeit

[Hook]
The truth's twofold
Seek what the truth holds
Peek through the view to beyond
Two souls
The truth's twofold
Seek what the truth holds
Peek through the view to beyond
Two souls

[Verse 2]
Hark, I’m the noise that you hear after dark
The cold chill feeling that you fear with half your heart
There’s no need to train me in martial arts
A supernatural human, that’s all
Imagine you in that form
Picture what you would do
If you could choose the platform
Traverse the universe, moving through the back door
Schrödinger's H4XOR, what did you kill that cat for?
Is it Jodie or Ellen Page? Deity or David Cage
Reality’s a game we play, grab a seat and save the day
I saw a snail crawling straight across a razor blade
And it escaped unscathed, no sign of violence
There’s no use, it’s futile trying hiding
I am Aiden

[Hook]
The truth's twofold
Seek what the truth holds
Peek through the view to beyond
Two souls
The truth's twofold
Seek what the truth holds
Peek through the view to beyond
Two souls
