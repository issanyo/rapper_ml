[Intro]
I'm Dan Bull
And according to my watch
It's eleven fifty-nine
My watch is one minute slow

[Verse 1]
Hey, hello stranger
You're alone, ain't ya?
You're a lone ranger
What a tone changer
No neighbours so far away from your home range
Roamin' open plains so dangerous
You're playing Russian roulette
With a bullet in an unknown chamber
So make use of the brain God gave ya or it'll be blown away
Payback

[Chorus]
McCree's peacekeeper seeks any head honcho
Put a bullet through their head like a head through a poncho
It's high noon, better ride soon
There's no time to rest
Head to the horizon and roll through the wild, wild west

[Verse 2]
Distinguished by his particular apparel
In which he dispatches batches of fishes in barrels
Back in the saddle and addled with bourbon
Trouble is certain
Disturbing your suburban world
The bubble is bursting, a tug of the curtains
And the whole thing comes tumbling back down to earth
Quick have a sip of the whiskey because I'm on my third cup
And feeling perked up
Strode up to the bar, smoking a cigar
B-A-M-F aren't notes on a guitar
Focused deadeye, spaghetti western Jedi with the same robotic arm
McCree's at the top, the cream of the crop
You're dreaming if you believe he's gonna stop
Breeze in and clean up, do we even need Reaper?
Aiming the heater, keen as a heatseeker
Keeping the peace with the piece, the peacekeeper
The key piece of the team, defeat fleets of people
Seeking to beat elite leaders
Reckon they'll achieve it? Me neither
Frequently repeating the scene, twenty-four seven
You're seeing seasons of Kiefer
Et tu, Brutus? Bleeding Caesar?
Yeah, read 'em and weep like a John Green feature
Read 'em and weep like a John Green feature novel
No other rapper would say that!

[Chorus]
McCree's peacekeeper seeks any head honcho
Put a bullet through their head like a head through a poncho
It's high noon, better ride soon
There's no time to rest
Head to the horizon and roll through the wild, wild west

[Verse 3]
Hammer fanner, fan the hammer at a rapid rate
You're trying to bat away the blasts
Playing patacake against Cassius Clay
Jabbing fast as the camera's capture rate
Battered by the hands of fate
Smacking off your crown like acid rain
That accurate aim could blast away
The fastest sailing hand grenade
Coming at your face, congratulations, kappa
I'll pass on the clammy handshake
You're chances of flanking and ganking the man
Are flat as a manta ray pancake
Beating McCree's like meeting Anne Hathaway on Chaturbate
It ain't gonna happen, mate
Your happy days went thataway
Snatched away, but now your face is wrapped in gaffa tape
So pray they get that ransom paid
Like the handsome man from Santa Fe's
A candidate for financial aid
Who laid a trap with a vast array
Of fantastic ways to make you pass away
Then wait 'til after the wake to deface the place your ashes lay

[Chorus]
McCree's peacekeeper seeks any head honcho
Put a bullet through their head like a head through a poncho
It's high noon, better ride soon
There's no time to rest
Head to the horizon and roll through the wild, wild west

[Outro]
Well... it's high noon somewhere in the world
