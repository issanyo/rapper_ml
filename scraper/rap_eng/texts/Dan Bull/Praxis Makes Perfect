[Intro]
Since the Aug Incident
All the naturals have been more insolent
So bring your instruments
Let's make this shindig a bit more intimate

[Hook]
Ask Icarus, the gods are sick of us
Making a new rib from dust
The Lord made man in his own image
And this visage isn't really how he pictured us
Stars shine over the apartheid of our time
I can't lie, each side's only half right
Every atom has a half-life
Every Adam has a dark side
Damn, what happened last night?
The apartheid of our time
I can't lie, each side's only half right
Every atom has a half-life
Every Adam has a dark side

[Verse 1]
In every nation, segregation is the expectation
Jensen's an agent sent to center stage to change the station
Man's machinations demand moderation
Masses need emancipation and liberation
Morality's in need of mediation
Answers to what's improvement and what's mutilation
We don't need to wait for mutation
We took over from God with our body modification
Is it folly to play Daedelus? Is it dangerous
To aim for the place where the angel is?

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I am a bit fraxious, ramming in praxis kits 'till I react anaphylaxis
I cannot relax since coming back from the blackness
Snapping your back as if I'm snapping a matchstick
I'm a black hat hacker with a fat chip
Sat on my shoulder revolving the ratchet, holding a hatchet
Losing hold of control 'til I'm batshit
Am I a man or just a the soul in a gadget?
I sit and think when I go to the latrine:
When I die, am I ghost in the machine?
Is there a code between a hope and a dream?
If not for the Neuropozyne, I'm sober and clean
Sneeking around halls and I'm peeking around corners
Thinking about bringing about peace, law and order
Reform the law, before there's deep disorder in the streets
'Cause I don't really want to be the enforcer
But I will if I'm made to, so stay in check
Ideas are contagious, they infect
So mind what you say and who it may affect
If life is a game, then it's Deus Ex

[Hook]
