[Verse 1]
My wisdom teeth are causing me trouble
Forming a huddle in the back of my mouth
And now to talk is a struggle
So I trade the punchlines for more of a subtle approach
And just hope you decode more than all of the puzzle
'Cause of course I've gone pop, I wasn't born in a bubble
Fuck my kingdom for a horse, I'd give my horse for a cuddle
And I'm bored of all the posturing a lot of hip hoppers bring
Sincerity's like love: it doesn't cost a thing
So always check the pocket of your jeans
Before you set the rinse on the washing machine
Buy a stack of birthday cards and presents
So you can use them in the event that you forget them
Then throw away fifty things you haven't used lately
Ideally you'd only keep what you use daily
Make the phone call that you've been putting off for months
It's a load off your mind and you'll be done in time for lunch

[Chorus]
Pull out my wisdom teeth
To give to each of you
Who never will admit defeat
And I think I'll be A-OK
If I live to see the day
My wisdom teeth decay
Pull out my wisdom teeth
To give to each of you
Who never will admit defeat
And I think I'll be A-OK
Yeah, I'll be A-OK

[Verse 2]
I see and hear quotes everywhere
Proverbs and advice from experts, sages and inspirational figures
But it's not particularly useful in comparison to the wisdom I've acquired
Simply through living my day to day, mundane life
And with these abilities, I'm on a Steve Miller steez

We hear so much deep advice
Philosophical insight on the way we should lead our lives
But you don't really need to be Jesus Christ
Just read between the lines and then you'll be just fine
You don't need a preacher to teach or guide
You through the maze, each day leads you deep inside
So keep an eye out, see the lighthouse
Watch for the rocks and just reach for high ground
Patiently wait for the breeze to die down
Now I believe that we need a lie down
So I relax in the dentist's massive chair
Puffing on a heady mix of gas and air
The psychedelicism's elegance is evident
As black satin patterns pass and past passions flare
Yeah, and now there's plasma everywhere

[Chorus]
Pull out my wisdom teeth
To give to each of you
Who never will admit defeat
And I think I'll be A-OK
If I live to see the day
My wisdom teeth decay
Pull out my wisdom teeth
To give to each of you
Who never will admit defeat
And I think I'll be A-OK
Yeah, I'll be A-OK

[Outro]
I never had such fun in my entire life
I'm feeling like Tenguy right now
Shoutout to Tenguy
He's out there
Somewhere
I hope
Shoutout to you too
