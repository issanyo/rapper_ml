[Verse 1]
My name's Kaitlin
I've been away since this time last year
Ages and ages
I've been abroad
I't been a long road
But I'm getting bored
So I've got aboard and gone home
Get through the door
I don't really know
Where anybody is
As if there's nobody home
Hopefully though
I'll find a clue
It better be a joke they're trying to do

[Hook]
I've gone home
And I'm on my own
I've gone home
And I'm all alone

[Verse 2]
I've been around everywhere
Nothing found yet
I've looked outside
I've looked downstairs
I've looked upstairs
Tell me now where?
I'm well scared
This is getting pretty out there
Where's Mom and Dad
Where's Samantha
Somewhere in the mansion
There's an answer
Have they left?
Are they dead from cancer?
Kidnapped by the Feds or gangsters?
I'm wracked with a sense of dread
So deep i could believe it was a necromancer
There's an atmosphere that's noxious
Something bleak and evil watches
But there's nothing here but sheets and boxes
Nobody's holding people hostage
I just need the key
To reveal each secret
Like a seasoned locksmith

[Hook] X2
I've gone home
And I'm on my own
I've gone home
And I'm all alone

[Verse 3]
I'm losing my mind in a psycho house
So I pray no lights go out
It's just me, my lone self
No family, no life, no sound
No clues so I know nought
And I'm bloody terrified on my own, HELP
All I have is letters and scraps
No weapons except for this map
I'm desperate for something better than that
If I have any chance to defend from attacks
Not there is a hatch
To enter the attic
It's the place that I've left to the last bit
Now I've got the key
I'm prepared to get past it
I need to know either way whether it's tragic
Or whether my head has gone mad
And so I hold on to my breath
And then grab it

[Hook] X2
I've gone home
And I'm on my own
I've gone home
And I'm all alone
