This is a letter to Bethesda
In which I beg you to stick together
For the new elder scrolls and you flipping better
Other wise I'm going to pester you forever
Except when I'm playing fallout new vegas this November
But please we need another elder scrolls
If I don't get another one I'll go out of control
Sure fallout was a hole different level and it was incredible
But it didn't have the visual elegance and mistic mythic elements
That lifted it through excellence and into sheer perfectionism
Transcendence isn't something I'd expect sitting next to computers
But what you presented to us is beauteous
Playing oblivion made me oblivious to my surroundings
How could a game be this intricate
But after a thousand hours of play
I'm inthralled with it all now to this day
I've found an escape from the imperial prison of everyday living
So take me to oblivion again
Take me to oblivion again
Take me to oblivion

Thanks dan I couldn't have put it better
Get it together Bethesda or we'll keep penning you letters
Being a vault dweller was special but wet was forgettable
So I'll never settle for anything less than an elder scrolls
Consumed by blood moon swallowed by morrowind
When I step into oblivion I'm instantly lost in it
Escape the modern concrete office monotony
But not only when I pop the DVD rom in the slot and unlock my dreams
Grab my magic hat daggers and a wabbajack
Pack them in the saddle bag and travel through these savage lands
Is quite depressing how obsessed I was getting
With checking out every chest to collect every set of weapons
I sand on the planets edge and gaze at the Hazy sea
It's crazy how ones and zeros behave so amazingly
Take me from these rainy streets
Please take me to oblivion again
Please Take me to oblivion again
Please Take me to oblivion
