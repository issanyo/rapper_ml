[Intro]
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to pay our last respects to our dear departed brother. We mourn his passing for he was a good man

[Verse]
I'm Killian Samuels, I used to be a US Marshal
Tracking down fugitives with the newest arsenal
Up 'til my passenger plane
Lost a couple of nuts and bolts and crashed
This hole's a bit of a culture clash
But don't let it hold you back
Now I'm a bounty hunter, rounding up chumps for a lump sum
Hunting pond scum amongst the clutter and junk, who wants some?
You'll need a strong stomach, this is not for the easily queasy
If you want something easy peasy, you're in the wrong street, believe me
Try to flee from me, you'll see the reason people fear me
Friends are few and far between so foes, I keep them near me
I'm getting closer and closer, so I hope you hear me clearly
Still on your toes believing you can deceive and beat me, really?!
Every day I'm facing death and a plethora of bigger threats
But I hate to say that I may be facing my biggest yet
My game development's been dropped and stubbed out like a cigarette
In an executive decision that may be gamer's biggest regret
Listen Bethesda, the first Prey was a great game, shame on you!
I pray that you make Prey 2 or I may prey on you
I don't know what happened behind the scenes to make it fall through
But I'm asking Pete Hines to please try to pull through
I'll buy the thing twice, even thrice if I need to
Just give the franchise the fans like so dear a reboot
I'll buy the thing twice, even thrice if I need to
I pray that you make Prey 2 or I may prey on you

[Outro]
Hah! No one's better than me
I rap for games that exist hypothetically
