[Intro]
Let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
(Ah ah)
Let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
Ay
Let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
Ay
Let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
(Ah)

[Verse 1]
Raver, straight out the favela
Bringing a breakdown with the fader (yeah)
Make soundwaves of countless flavours
Wow, true musical taste synesthesia (whoa)
Going to change up your vision of the same stuff
'Til you're tingling with sensations of elation (oh)
Exhilaration, admit it, the feeling is thrilling
Fulfilling and chilling
No wonder the kid on the stage is making a killing
He's got millions, top billing
So stop feeling sorry for yourself
And start singing it:
Ay, let's take it from the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
What, turn up the EDM
Increase the speed, boost the BPM
No middle of the road, no medium
No stopping these flows 'til we see the end (oh)

[Chorus]
One good thing about music
When it hits, you feel no pain
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
We've heard music only makes existence richer
Lúcio throws the switch
Tones and notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture (whoah)

[Verse 2]
All systems go, going to go the distance
Going to give assistance, can I get a witness
Firing on all pistons, pistols
It's futile trying to put up a resistance (ah)
Blowing up transistors
Flicking the switch so damn quick, his trigger finger is blistered
EQ flicking the frequency so frequently
The beat and he could even conceivably
Conceive a fetus, just so he or she
Could feature in remix releases
Oh Jesus, if it wasn't that egregious
That lyric would have been prestigious
But I don't know where to draw the line
True music knows no borderline
So let me divulge a little thought of mine
If you're bored of music, then you're bored of life

[Chorus]
One good thing about music
When it hits, you feel no pain
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
We've heard music only makes existence richer
Lúcio throws the switch
Tones and notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture

[Verse 3]
Pile in, overpowering to anyone who can hear
So hurry up, let the phonographic magic carry you
Playing solo, Joe Satriani jamming on a strat
Through a pedal with a fat 'wah', Sharia
Taking the sound barrier, breaking it down, hell yeah
Shaking the ground, while you were waiting around, dallying
Now I hate to tell you, but you're making yourself embarrassing
Without comparison
So mate, sit down and have a think
You good?
Put your headphones on
Take it to the top
Wait for the place where the bass gonna drop
Peekaboo, beat going to boom, keep in the groove (uh)
He going to move, sneak in the booth, speaking the truth
Speeding the group, healing them too, feeling anew
Revealing the true meaning of music and speaking of tunes
You can stream this through the service you prefer
'Cause you deserve it, dude
Perfect, woo

[Chorus]
One good thing about music
When it hits, you feel no pain
One good thing about Lúcio's music
Is it can make a play of the game
We've heard music only makes existence richer
Lúcio throws the switch
Tones and notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture
And notes composing us a picture (whoah)

[Outro]
Take it to the top, top (take it to the top)
Bass gonna drop, drop (bass gonna drop)
Take it to the top, top (take it to the top)
Bass gonna drop, drop (bass gonna drop)
Take it to the top, top (take it to the top)
Bass gonna drop, drop (bass gonna drop)
Take it to the top, top (take it to the top)
Bass gonna drop (bass gonna drop)
