[Intro: Ali-A]
Come on, Ali...
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 1]
Ayy
I'm on a two week holiday (okay, nice), do you wanna play?
(No! I'm kidding I'm kidding I'm kidding)
'Cause everybody else has gone away suddenly (what?)
It's rather strange, but I've got to say I kind of like the change (whoo)
My entire neighborhood's a violent firing range (nice)
Crashing your mainframe, I hope you made a backup
Can't even keep a straight face, you make me crack up
Mate, get out my personal space and back up (okay)
Unless you wanna see my body count rack up
I can keep it up all night, so baby back up (uh)
I'm the kind of guy with whom the ladies like to shack up (yeah)
And every time they tear it down, I build it back up (bam, it's up)
So why are you even trying? I advise you pack up
Like a white guy in Harlem trying to black up (whoo)
Who acts surprised when he's the one they want to smack up (what did I do?)
Night time's coming, better grab your gang and stack up (okay)
Load your weapons, set the trap up, and turn the track up

[Chorus]
(Whoo)
Put on the coffee machine (yeah)
I've got a feeling that we're gonna be up all night (nice)
We're taking one for the team (yeah)
It's not a week's holiday at all, no, it's a Fortnite (whoo)
Hidden in the dark lurk horrible beings
So keep your blinds and your pleated curtains drawn tight (nice)
And we won't even know what was seen
Until the dusk's dust settles in the dawn light

[Verse 2]
At the end of the day, everybody back to my place
But I'm sorry, no reclining by the fireplace
(This is a little bit upsetting)
'Cause every life is only priced at what the buyer pays
We are responsible for our survival, our entire race
A dust storm's coming and it's thunderous
Ten hundred Husks rush from the dusk
Poor personal hygiene, a pungent musk
Phwoar! But I'm surrounded by the chums I trust (yeah)
We're ready to ruck with anyone that comes at us
Though for just a tick I wonder if my gun's enough (okay)
Until rrrap, shots fired from my blunderbuss
Are bloody numberless, you better run, you puss
Over hot coals or rather bumpy pot holes (yeah)
To toilet cubicles that don't have any bog rolls (okay)
My team will follow me to anywhere the fog rolls
Fortify the stronghold, #Squadgoals

[Chorus]
(Whoo)
Put on the coffee machine (oh, what)
I've got a feeling that we're gonna be up all night (I could just go to bed right now)
We're taking one for the team
It's not a week's holiday at all, no, it's a Fortnite (whoo)
Hidden in the dark lurk horrible beings
So keep your blinds and your pleated curtains drawn tight (nice)
And we won't even know what was seen
Until the dusk's dust settles in the dawn light

(Let's build it sweet, let's build it fast)

[Verse 3]
I'm building a building that you'll be thrilled to be killed in (whoo)
Feelin' the thrill of the chase while you just chill with the children (okay)
'Til I dwell in a fortress, thick as the shell of a tortoise
Repelling the horde just with everyday tools plus (yeah)
Impaling these fool Husks, together with sword thrusts
Like elephant's dual tusks, my brethren are dauntless (okay)
Ooh, hello there gorgeous, you look hella exhausted
So step in my porch and let me tell you your fortune (okay)
You're 'bout to hear the best shit ever recorded
Whatever the result is, I shed a small tear
And burn my enemies to a crisp, they're ready salted
Oh, can you believe how easily they get insulted? (You're pissing me off)
Inflicting harm when it's dark, so get your armoured pyjamas
Hit your llama pi√±ata and collect the treasure (ooh, more bandages)
Get set for hours of violence, it's a gala of carnage
And tomorrow's so far that it's effectively never

[Chorus]
(Whoo)
Put on the coffee machine (yeah)
I've got a feeling that we're gonna be up all night (nice)
We're taking one for the team
It's not a week's holiday at all, no, it's a Fortnite (whoo)
Hidden in the dark lurk horrible beings
So keep your blinds and your pleated curtains drawn tight (nice)
And we won't even know what was seen
Until the dusk's dust settles in the dawn light

[Outro: Ali-A]
This is a little bit upsetting as someone who's put a lot of time into this game
