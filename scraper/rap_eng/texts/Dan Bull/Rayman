[Intro]
Ay
Look

[Verse 1]
The Glade of Dreams is in danger, my friend, so…
Wake your mates, preparate for adventure
The tension and the suspense is getting immense
A set of events that doesn't make any sense
Enter the dream team
We've got the teensies
A little blue big nosed load of wee beings
Then we've got Globox
My best chum
Whose refreshingest of beverages
Is a cup of plum juice
Barbara the Aryan Barbarian
There is barely a woman wearing fierier hair
And then there is nobody on Earth who so rarely
Frowns as infrequently as Murfy the Fairy
And now for the star of the show me, Rayman
Slightly insane, man
I might need a brain scan

[Chorus]
Hey man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha!
Hooray, man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha! Hee!

[Verse 2]
The Bubble Dreamer is deep asleep
And he seems to be
Struggling with a heap of trouble
In his dreams and this means
For us that there is going to be
The meanest of repercussions
Just look at these stacks of paintings, they're captivating
We took a little peek and they snapped us straight in
Racing all over the world with my good chums
Taking out all the horrid little hoodlums
I hope you've got good thumb reflexes
To get enough good lums to afford a Lexus
It'll cost you an arm and a leg
'Til you're looking like me
Just some garms and a head
But I don't consider it a disability
Having no limbs gives ridiculous agility

[Chorus]
Hey man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha!
Hooray, man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha! Hee!

[Verse 3]
I'm an acrobatic combatant compatible with rapping
Because my reactions are faster than actual magic is
A manic man with detachable hands and his gang
That's all that stands up to battle these anarchists
Running around, I jump on the ground
Up and then down, look what I found
Strumming it loud in front of a crowd
A wonderful sound

[Chorus]
Hey man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha!
Hooray, man! Ha! Hoo!
It’s Rayman! Ho! Ha! Hee!

My name's Rayman
And I'm the main man
My name's Rayman
And I'm the main man
My name's Rayman
And I'm the main man
My name's Rayman
And I'm the main man
Hey, man! Ha!
