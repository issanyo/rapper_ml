I've lost my temper
I've lost my ring, my keys
I've lost my mind, I've...
I've lost my dignity
I've lost my voice
Lost my virginity
And now I've lost my train of thought too
Silly me
But then, I've done enough stupid things to last a lifetime
And by my track record, there's plenty more in the pipeline
I might drive without my lights shining at night time
I've lied, tried to hide my pride, started fights
I had no chance of me winning
Go back to beginnings
A new leaf, clean sheets
Pillow, mattress and linen
But I'm no master of living
I don't factor it in
I'm too busy daydreaming new ways
To expose facts that I've hidden
So instead of facing facts
I'm just making tracks
With a face that's glazed over
A vacant gaze
Shows the same range of problems
That are plaguing Jay-Hova
Make no mistake though
I aim to take over

Though that might be stupid
Do I give two shits?
No!
