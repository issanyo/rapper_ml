Welcome to the next generation

[Verse 1]
Man, I feel like a superstar
In a high powered supercar
Shoot for the stars, no stopping me
I’m revving up a cacophony
Doesn’t matter whatever you offer me
Won’t swap it for anything, honestly
The road ahead of me’s calling
And pole position is where I’ve just got to be
I’m an ace in a race, set a pace
That’ll take you to a range of places
Make you say “Ooh, great, amazing”
A trail in my wake as I blaze away
‘cause it’s the way that I make my paper
Do me a favour: Get out of my way, bruh
Boy racer with places to be
So it’s safe to say I’ll see you later

[Verse 2]
Forza Motorsport
Will open doors to a sort of ocean port
That’ll flow a course from coast to shores
The poetry of motion’s yours
Saddle up, we’re going on tour
You’ll ride astride your chosen horse
Through a load of applause
Such force
You were only supposed to blow the doors
Horsepower, galloping gallantly
Shoot for the stars, Galileo Galilei
Hey! Don’t prang my McClaren, geez
The tab to patch up the damage
Is grand as your annual salary
And apparently you just cannot handle me
So hand me the keys as I shoot for the stars
Blasting these supercars
To a brand new galaxy
