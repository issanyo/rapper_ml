Some of the happiest days are when the sun rays cascade
Over your back in the most naturally placid of ways
You don't have to ask whether perhaps it'll rain
And the centigrade never strays past twenty eight
It's fantastically great kicking back with your mates
And knowing no, you don't have to act to your age
You can snack on a Flake or take a basket of cakes
But make sure you've got some factor eight splashed on your face
And the ladies make daisies attached in a chain
While the lads entertain them with a basketball game
And then after we're knackered and the match has been played
Grab a glass of lemonade and relax in the shade
We'll bask and just laze in the grass's green blades
And sit back and just gaze at the paths of the planes
Nothing matters today, you can chatter and play
Playful antics under blankets of immaculate haze

Once upon a summer
The sun plays across the lawn
Once upon a summer
The air is sweet and warm

Once upon a summer
Heavenly and calm
Once upon a summer
It's never been this fun

It's ace when you're tipsy and playing with a frisbee
There ain't been better days in the pages of history
And though your hay fever itches and makes you be sniffly
It's blatantly plain that you'll savour and miss these
Great times when they're gone, days lying in the sun
Bathing, misbehaving and playfighting for fun
They might have been some of the days of your life that you'll always
Be reminded of when your time to pass away finally comes
And as the day becomes night and the sun goes down
The shadows grow slow and cloak round your home town
There's no sound but the bees and the birds
And slowly but certainly the season returns
You turn down to the ground and there's leaves on the earth
Turning brown and allowing the trees to rebirth
There's a breeze in the air and it breathes through your hair
And that's it - summer leaves for the year

Summer's come and gone
The day's no longer young
Summer's come and gone
But the memory lives on
