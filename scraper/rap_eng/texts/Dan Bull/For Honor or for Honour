[Verse 1]
Do you know how heavy heavy metal is?
And are you aware of the relief that death'll give?
Do you comprehend that you'll prepare for several years
Consecutively just for several seconds where you'll get to live?
The devil revels in revels in peril bearing witness
To feral zealots spilling vessels while you beg forgiveness
All's fair in love and war
Scorched air, the oven door's ajar
You took a snort and smelt the charred corpse
Blood and gore
A sudden pause
Slow the flow like a southern drawl
I'll cut you down until there's nothing standing
Bugger all
No trees in your countryside
It's something like an urban sprawl
I've got the wherewithal
To usurp your rule for ever more

[Chorus]
Why did I do it, your honor?
For honor, your honor
When you're on a roll
You're going to do the things you sodding want to
And by the tear sliding down the cheek of the madonna
You can steal my dignity
But still it lives in me for honor

[Verse 2]
I've got a path to find
And an axe to grind
Close combat mastermind
So pass the wine, love
That's the fine stuff
I don't want to be the last to find love
That's the kind of fast life I lived
In a past life
Capsize the brig
Now the tides are in
Baptised in it
And tied to the mast of a pirate ship
Find me the man that can fight like this
And I'll chastise him with a childlike flick
Of the wrist with a fistful of iron, I guess
There's a finite risk
In that I might miss
But who cares on a night like this?
Swap a twilight tiff
For a night night kiss
It's my life and the highlight is
When I'm sharpening my knife like my wits

[Chorus]
Why did I do it, your honor?
Why did I do it, your honor?
Why did I do it, your honor?
Why did I do it, your honor?
For honor, your honor
When you're on a roll
You're going to do the things you sodding want to
And by the tear sliding down the cheek of the madonna
You can steal my dignity
But still it lives in me for honor
For honor
For honor
Why did I do it, your honor?
For honor, your honor
When you're on a roll
You're  going to do the things you sodding want to
And by the tear sliding down the cheek of the madonna
You can steal my dignity
But still it lives in me for honor
Why did I do it your honor?
For honor your honor
When you're on a roll
You're going to do the things you sodding want to
And by the tear sliding down the cheek of the madonna
You can steal my dignity
But still it lives in me for honor
