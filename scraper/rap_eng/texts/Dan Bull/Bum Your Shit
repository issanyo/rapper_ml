[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
Seven days of the week my brain's at it's peak
That's the payback you reap from being a blatant geek
Then maybe you'll see why so many people feel it
My speech is lethal, meaning feeble people fear it
But if you fear it maybe you need to re-hear it
I talk about what other lyricists are scared to
I tackle issues you wish you could dare to
And fair do's if you're sticking to the horrorcore
But don't go moaning that nobody's wanting more
Sitting on bean bags listening to weed rap
Bitching that the kids would rather hear Relapse
Don't you see that you're missing the point?
'cause no-one gives a shit what you stick in your joint
So if you're disappointed then learn a lesson
Convert to better methods and then heads'll yearn for seconds

[Chorus]
We don't bum your shit
So come up with something better than it
When you're the only one to bum your shit
Then come up with something better than it

[Verse 2: Joey Gzus]
Look, mmm, I've got to be real
There's not a lot of rappers out here that I honestly feel
You see me, I'd bite your hand off if you offered a deal
'cause I've got kids that need warm water and a quality meal
For real, I pride myself on being versatile
Like my hooks Auto-Tuned, still keep the verses wild
So if you don't like me singing on my hooks
Then don't listen - the fact is, I couldn't give a...
Look, they're acting like they're Premier League
Forced multi-syllabics over knock-off Premier beats
In a scene where everybody seems to be next in the scene
And the need to be credible is becoming incredibly weak
Gzus, let's keep it moving
'cause for people to feel your music you need improvement
Like live shows where you get your respect
They're like trapeze acts 'cause their life depends on the net
Joey

[Chorus]
We don't bum your shit
So come up with something better than it
When you're the only one to bum your shit
Then come up with something better than it

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
Too many rappers just rap about rap
There's a whole world out there, rap about that
What happens now is a matter of fact
So if you want to keep it real, put that on a track
I stand back to back with novelists and poets
Activists, journalists, and those that show it's
An ugly world out there, when it should be beautiful
But if beauty is truth, then I stay true to form
Who'd have thought the class clown would back down
Into the background and lay some fat tracks down?
I stand proud behind what I believe
And what I believe is I can't believe what I've achieved
Every step of the way I get better
But nevertheless I make it my aim to elevate every day
No matter what it takes it's worth paying the price
'cause the day you stop learning is the day you die
