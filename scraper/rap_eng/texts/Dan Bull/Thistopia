The dystopia
Gets slowly worse
Over the years
We're going to burn

And I'm sorry for making you scared
But it's a sorry state of affairs

When man's a virus with shoes, a violent abuser
Of the planet he resides on and relies on it too
I want to do something to change it
But I'm afraid it's inside us, entwined in our nature
You and I should face it - the primary trait that
Unites the races is the way we use nature and rape it
I'm trying to find pride in my nation
But I'll die waiting for higher civilisation

Sorry for making you scared
But it's a sorry state of affairs when

The dystopia
Gets slowly worse

The dystopia
Gets slowly worse
Over the years
We're going to burn

And I'm sorry for making you scared
But it's a sorry state of affairs - listen

The class system of a past Britain
That still runs fast and thick through the innards of every last citizen
If you're from Pakistan, black-skinned, or just act different
You'll be asked questions and blacklisted
The fact is we're attached umbilically
To a fetid capitalist trap full of misery
But that isn't what gets me, the ignorant hegemony
But the fact that we're happy to live with it

The disaffected youth are in effect living proof
That respect is reduced to a reckless abuse
Of the ends where they grew through the stem to the roots
They will step on your shoes then expect you to move
Flipping heck, next thing they'll do's
Have you hanging in a hood, neck through a noose
So whether you accept or you're scared of the truth
Say your prayers cos we're due for a desolate future
