[Intro]
My favourite politician died today
And I've written these words in his honour

[Verse]
Rest in peace Tony Benn, one of the only men
To keep integrity through parliament, right to his lowly end
Held steadfast inside that phony den
So if you know a more honest MP, show me then
And I don't give a damn how you feel on socialism
When it comes to his integrity there's clearly no decision
Came from a privileged background just like our leaders did
Oxford PPE graduate, but kept it real and shit

So it's only fair that we should note
That between Tony Blair and Tony Benn
Benn was a loner in the cronies' lair
New Labour alienated him, made him marginalised
Pulled hard on the ties, wouldn't be part of the lies
Man, the way the political game has since changed
Cameron, Miliband and Clegg should look at him and feel ashamed
They'll keep their arse in line, just to toe the party line
Part of a mindstate that's hardly yours and hardly mine

When he became an MP 64 years ago
Who'd have thought he'd have over 60 more years to go
He was never ready to be a hereditary peer
Spearheaded a campaign to ditch the champagne for regular beer
He didn't want to be a lord, didn't want to be awarded
For things he never achieved, these should be ignored
What are we here for if not to assist
Our sisters and brothers cross the bridge across the distance from others

Blew through these damn walls like a human cannonball
His compassion was such that he refused to eat animals
Amnesty for striking miners unite in kindness
Fighting violence decry the loss of life in Palestine and Ireland
Writing diaries, spiking trident
If you like that kind of line up, grab a light and light your pipes up
He lost his title, but he kept on climbing
Lost government, but he kept on grinding
He lost the mines, but he kept on striking
He lost his seat, but he kept on riding
He lost his teeth, but he kept on biting
Lost mobility, but kept on writing
He lost his wife, but he kept on driving
Now he's lost his life but we will keep on fighting

Rest in peace, Tony Benn
Your legacy lives on

I do not share the general view that market forces are the basis of political liberty
Every time I see a person in a cardboard box in London, I say
"That person is a victim of market forces"
Every time I see a pensioner who can't manage:
A victim of market forces
The sick, who are waiting for medical treatment that they could accelerate by private insurance
They are the victims of market forces

If you can find money to kill people
You can find money to help people
Democracy is the most revolutionary thing in the world
Far more revolutionary than socialist ideas, anybody else's idea
Because if you have power, you use it

When I was young, my dad said to me:
"The basis of political work is very simple
Always say what you mean, mean what you say
Do what you said you'd do if you have a chance
And don't [? 2:49]"
And when I look back, I think that was good advice
