[Introduction]
Arrows shot
Arrows shot in front of the mineshaft
There's about to be some TNT blowing up
Send all the available admins
Send in the moderators
Send in the MVP's
Send in the owners
Send in the...frick

[Verse 1]
I wanna find ores
Cuz I mined and I wanna dig all this
But it's cool, after digging it, I'll mine all the lapis
Oh no, you getting mad?
Gonna drop the diamonds right into the lava
That is extremely absurd
And now you wanna be the cynosure
You talk like you finding no ores, ayy
Is that a diamond or lapis, ayy
Say that to your MVP's face, ayy
How you cheated on Sky Wars
Hey, you look afraid, must have seen a charged creeper
Maybe you run away or fight if you have armor

[Verse 2]

Woo, you've just been griefing
Ever since your little TNT blew up
Let staff you know you did it all
That you're capable to blow up all of my house
That's bad, that I saw you trying to grief my house
I was more disappointed that when I found out I hit 200k
Man gotta mine
Gotta mine, mine, mine
Cuz when you don't have a mansion, replace it with a diamond
You really don't see your friends hop in a mine
Hoping to join, they're so tired of getting griefed
Over and over and over and over and over again

[Verse 3]

Oh my gosh, you are a hacker
You make me so mad with your endless griefing
You're on the blacklist now, you dummy
Now go to the nether and heck off
You're messing up the server, so try your best to remember
You're not a player, all you are is a griefer
Let's find the block of day but which one is it?
And it's floating massive fire is a TNT block
You're like Sethbling, without the talent
You're like Lionmaker, but a bigger pedo
You're like MinecraftKing but, no, wait you're exactly like MinecraftKing

[Refrain]
Do you wanna grief the server
But dude, you're gonna be banned soon
How can you grief all the stuff
But you're too scared to do it on Mineplex

[Verse 4]
Little noob, little jerk
Forgot to finish writing this lyric
Admit that you're just hacking
[inaudible]
Get it, because you're a hacker, this is what you wanted right?
Hey, I'm gonna grief the server with my cheats from 2005
Holy sheep, you're as predictable as a noob's house
To call you just a griefer would be an insult to the hackers

[Verse 5]
Whatever you said the very few did
You've done too much, you're sick, just quit, that's it
You're a- you're a hippo
Here's what I predict
You're a killing spree that will go attended- unattended
How- how can the griefer just not know they've griefed too much
But let me guess, you're crying trying to get unbanned but that won't work
When you're done, at least before you're done, you are just the average griefer dude
You're a bad griefer
You've done too much, you're sick and that's that
So now I think you're just a coal in the mineshaft

[Verse 6]
Got diamonds, emeralds and the gold that I dig
And you're still gonna be a little noob
Now I'm finished this plan
It was just 3 minutes and it was pretty bad
And I got a question to ask you dude
You wanna get banned too?
