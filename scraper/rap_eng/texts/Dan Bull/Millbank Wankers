[Intro]
This is addressed to the silly little children
Spoiling a legitimate protest
And giving a bad name to an otherwise worthy cause

[Verse]
You bunch of fucking wannabe anarchists
Don't you see the irony
Anti-government
But you want the government to provide the [grease? 0:16]
I agree that we could do
Without the higher fees
But that doesn't mean that I believe
That I have license to be violent, see
What? If something's not much in your taste
You can act in disgrace (what?)
Mate, if that was the case
I'm fucking smashing your face
And if you really hate the bourgeoisie (yeah?)
Then why're you so happy for them to pay your degree? (uhh)
And just because they're raising all the fees, it doesn't mean
That you have [? 0:36] to smash glass in the face of the police
If that appauling course of action
Was truly for the best (yes?)
I would have thought you'd have the support of the NUS (yes)
So get off the roof, you stupid goon and go back to your room
There must be something a little more productive that you can do
So don't leave the halls of residents
'Til you come up with with more developments
'Cause at the most you're an embarrassment, and at the least
You're irrelevant

[Outro]
And if you wanna save yourself some money
And help the "oppressed working classes"
Then take your fucking 40Â£ sweatshop manufactured Che Guevara t-shirt back to the Gap store, you prick
