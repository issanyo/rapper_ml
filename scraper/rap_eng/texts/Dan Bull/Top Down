[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
I'm basking in the sunlight, hi-hat sizzling
Snare cracking like it's blasting in a gun fight
The pattern of the drum's tight, kick pumping in your stomach
Something like the aftermath of a drunk night
Daft cunt, see I like music that has spunk
Thrash, pop, rap, punk, drazz-wop, jazz, funk
I'm beginning a vinyl collection
Thinking of buying all the decks and equipment then hitting the nightlife with a vengeance
But I've got a penchant for sitting in silence
Headphones hugging my noggin, I'm nodding my head to the said tones
I might be flesh and bones, but when I do a verse
My vibrations disperse through the universe
We can see the frequency, percieve them through the channels
I need a deeper feeling please, leave me with the ammo
White noise, clean my teeth, weaken the enamel
Street life's a squeeze like a needle to a camel
Please, I would leave in peace, retreating with the mammals
While leaves of trees are green at least, creeping in my camo
But a bee could see through these with ease, keys of a piano
Basked in light from black to white, from BC to Anno

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Beit Nun]
There's no questioning Ben as an artist
My musical palette's not like yours
So the same brush I'll never be tarred with
I'm a sucker for a Hendrix guitar lick
But not a purist though, Kendrick Lamar's sick
Mate, head to the bar quick
And fetch me a large drink
I'm ready to get this cigar lit
Beer garden, start a party for the neighbours like
No sympathy, Marley and the Wailers, and Bacardi with a chaser
It's getting late so it's time to slip something a little harder in the shaker
Bit of Marvin on the playlist, then The Temptations
Followed by Smokey Robinson, we marvel at the greatness
I'm Syd Barrett on Interstellar Overdrive
I'm John Bonham in a hotel on a motorbike
I'm Ray Davies on a sunny afternoon
I'm Ian Curtis, I'm John Lennon, Bob Dylan and Keith Moon
Music helped me get through all I've been through
When just me, you, and the beat loop, how can I feel blue?
I've got videos and photographs if you need proof
I've lived, though I gave my plot away in the theme tune
Beit Nun up in your iPod docking station
Feel free to get up and leave if you're not relating
But if you are, take a seat, I'm down for the long awaited conversation
Two bonding strangers have when they're off their faces

[Chorus]
Domini
