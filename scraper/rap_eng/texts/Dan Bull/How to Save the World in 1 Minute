[Intro]
Oi (huh?)
Do you want to reduce climate change? (uh-huh!)
Then get off your botty and see
How many things you can do in one minute to help the environment

[Verse 1]
First attack plan, turning back the thermostat
And have a power shower, not an hour in the dirty bath
And when you're done, remember that you need to turn the tap off
And for that, you deserve a snack
But choose your food before you open the hatch
I've chosen a burger [bat? 0:19]
Clean your fridge 'til it's completely ice-free
And keep the heat of it slightly beneath five degrees
Buy things in bulk in multi packs, forget electric ovens
Cook with gas, drink right from the tap
Recycle a glass and buy environmental bags
Use rechargeables and plug your charger from the wall
And flick light switches off before you're charging through the door
Stretch your thighs, exercise
Collect some nice tangy green apples from your family tree
[? 0:38]
Eat organically, start a compost heap for planting seeds
And when the weather's nice, dry your pants naturally

[Chorus]
One minute to save the world
One minute to save the world

[Verse 2]
Check your tires, share your car, don't use a hose
But a bucket and some vinegar
Donate your clothes, make your own
Take a moment to check the verge
And pick up stuff you find next to the curb
Then get on your bicycle and spread the word
Protect the earth
Protect the earth
