[Verse 1]
We are off to the Moon
And it's full of lunatics with a new bag of tricks
This place needs luminous lick of paint
While I'm doin' this shit
Comin' through on a humorous tip
Then I switch from a clown to the brutalest prick
Getting through many clips
So my trigger fingers superhumanly ripped
Is there room in the Inn for a Lawbringer?
Enforcing enforcers to forcefully
Pick up a fork and nick your dinner?
Give some applause, I'm a pure winner
I'm a mixture of helpful and selfish
Marshal and Elvis, shark and a shellfish
Armed amour, and well fit, can't help it
I'm departing to Elpis

Woah
Everything's going all wobbly

[Verse 2]
I'mma find a pile of scrap to mash up in a grinder
Camp on a cliff and snipe ya
I'm a larger brain matter collider
Smashing up atoms and splattering minds up
No wonder that I have to remind you that
Hang one a second, what's that just behind you?
Got you in the botty with a shotty
Now your as a Nosh from a Rotty
Not rocky but I'll knock you out with my noccas
Gnocchi, out with your knockers
Moxxii, she's so hot I'm hot by Proxy
And Athena, have you seen her?
That Gladiator doesn't need an arena
Tell them Tiny Tina, just what she does
To my wiener's demeanor
Could I even be keener if she switched my decaf creamer
For a Cleavland Steamer, I'm an eager beaver
Too bloody sweet for a tea with sweetener
I launch VaultHunter.exe, so Doom you can keep your BFG, sir
Don't need that to leave your face looking like a piece of pizza

When the Moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie
Thatâ€™s a ballache, a ballache
When the Moon hits your eye
Like a big pizza pie
Thats a ballache, a ballache

[Chorus]
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (where?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (what?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (where?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back

[Verse 3]
He's a bastard, Handsome Jack
Keep the cash, have your ransom back
Him and dastardly plans get together
Like France and Jacques Chirac
'Cause this is what happens when twats attack
And if you answer back, then I'll clamp our trap
Fancy that, I'm a Dandy Dan, a fancy man in a fancy hat!
Claptrap hits hard and as hard as a clap track
On a no limit record clap track
If it moves, I'll frag that, bring it down like the NASDAQ
With my arsenal, I'm tear aparting all
Grammar Nazis that start a war
I don't want to boast, but I'm rather awe inspiring
When I'm flingin' bars galore
Hit with a critical? Typical, I told you shit'd get physical
Clips galore but I piss them all away in your face
Shoot anything from a brute to a cute bunny
Loot like a gold digger with a new hubby
Now I can't fit into my suit, 'cause I'm too tubby
That pile of sands glitched, is the dune buggy?

[Chorus]
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (where?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (what?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back (where?)
To the moon and back
To the moon and back, back, back
