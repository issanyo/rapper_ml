[Verse]
Welcome
Enter my house and see my balcony
You're bound to be astounded deeply
That there's not another house in town as sweet
I bought my own land; built it with my own hands
It's like Chopin's piano, man, it's so grand
Whether you're a lady or a hood rat
Good, bad
You won't resist me after witnessing my mudcrab
I'll run a bubble bath with enchanted suds
Have you pulling me off like a poorly fitted hubcap
I need the green to build my dream house
So I can grow my peas and beans and other greens in the greenhouse
Give me the keys, I'm keeping bees in the garden
Beat a skeever up, then bust a free with my bard
And I'm flossing in the trophy room
So don't go too soon
I still need to show you my minestrone soup
I baked some space cakes laced straight with Moon Sugar
Got a house, wife and two kids, but I'm no do-gooder
MTV Cribs; I'm still the Dragonborn
But now it's my cow that has the badass horns
It's getting late - I hope you understand
Look, Corrie's coming on in five
So get off my land
Milk drinker
