TryHardNinja:
Times are a-changin’
sometimes it’s too late
to stop the flames
after the world goes up in smoke

Ruins standing lonely
relics we called home once now a grave
that grows and grows
that grows and grows

[Chorus]
It was the day
day that we refused to die
when the fire changed
changed the colors of our skies
We remember
all the loved ones that it burned
they were the lucky ones
cause the fallout will be worse
hey

Endurance being tested
found no place to rest so give me strength
to push forward through
this desolate track

Companion at my side
my family just like mankind
now in shreds
locked in a vault no going back

[Chorus]
It was the day
day that we refused to die
when the fire changed
changed the colors of our skies
We remember
all the loved ones that it burned
they were the lucky ones
cause the fallout will be worse
hey

Meet lonely people and
shake their hands
their skin is rough
like it’s covered in sand

Faces wear wrinkles
like cracks in the dirt
they’re not the dead
but they are the cursed

Dan Bull:
I remember the second
the nuke dropped
no more new songs
on the jukebox

Scorched earth
the world of pure heart
shot nerves all cursed
debauched birth there’s naught worse

It’s like theater
seeing how the west ends
but I feel blessed when I look
down at my best friend

When everything you love is
ripped apart and scattered to the winds
that’s when you can tell
what really matters in the end

TryHardNinja:
[Chorus]
It was the day
day that we refused to die
when the fire changed
changed the colors of our skies
We remember
all the loved ones that it burned
they were the lucky ones
cause the fallout will be worse
hey
