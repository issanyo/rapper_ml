[Intro]
Dan Bull's back in the saddle
(ohh, yeah, eeighh)
(vroom)

[Verse]
I'm sitting on the saddle of my motorcycle
Kicking up the gravel that'll poke your eyeball
Making roads though only sidewards
Go to the right 'til I pwn my rivals
My bike can fly, I'm rising skyward
You wouldn't like to try this but I would
Go higher, no wires
'Til my bones are broke like plywood

Two wheels and a health care policy
When I ride, there's a health scare, honestly
With the hospital costs that I've got
Every Third World debt could be dropped and forgot
Look, chum, between me and you (yeah?)
There must be an easier route (yeah!)
But if I took a bus for an easy commute (yeah?)
Then I wouldn't see the scenery too
My team is a beat (mwah)
Fifty nifty people who
Can easily do maneuvres
That need to be seen to believe to be true (woo!)
We'll leave it to you
To see a futuristic mystic misfit
Do the sickest fliptrick in the district (shit)
'Til I break stuff like the dude that's in Limp Bizkit (hah)
You're too simplistic to risk it

(Hah) You could sit and sift through statistics
And never see another human who's sadistic (brah)
Masochistic, through ballistics (bang)
Kick in the ignition 'til my boots are twisted (ah)
True persistence and brutal quickness
Rips through resistance of stupid nitwits
It's a twist of the wrist and the gears are shifted (vroom)
Give me a kiss, oops, I smeared your lipstick (whoops)
Clearly gifted, considerably
We're here to get lifted, literally
If you're in my vision even peripherally
I'll rip you to little pieces deliberately
Plenty more fish in the sea, I'm throwing nets out (splash)
Picking a team, only the best, wow
Collectively we're going to leave you stressed out
'Til evidently you gonna need a rest
Pow!
I apologise for my intrusion
But I want to fight with Isaac Newton (hugh)
When I ride my bike disproving his life's delusion
I'd confuse him
Sir, gravity is a trite illusion
That tries reducing my skyward movement
But my conclusion is I'm going to fly
It's Trials Fusion

[Outro]
I float through the air like a cloud
Shaped like a motorbike
And made from pieces of a motorbike
Indistinguishable in fact from an actual motorbike!
With me on it
Flying
Like a cloud
That's shaped like a motorbike (laughs)
