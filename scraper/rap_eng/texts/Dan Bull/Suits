Step to the spot with my head just cocked
Suits wanna play when I flex this hot
Who's gonna pay for the mess that you want
I'm an art freak but a smart geek
And it's off when you offer a shred of exposure
But not any dollars that back all the boasting and talk
Got a bit of heat so you all really want it now
But come around and run your mouth, i gun it down
Most calls that I take go nowhere
Time limit on your deal, I'm so scared
I don't do it for the fame, I don't do it for the fans
I don't know what made you think that I'll do it for the man
Just wanna make earhole candy
And I'm doing it as fast as can be
And I'm doing just fine and dandy
Wanna play? better up that ante

I know you think you know
What we'd do for that gold
Your talk is cheap and old
So please just save it

"Hey dan, we're loving your music
And we're looking to use it
Can you come into london on tuesday?
For a chat and a couple of brews
Is two convenient for you?
Cool, I'll see you soon!"
Tuesday comes, I arrive in london
Rising price: £99, £100
Girl at reception hurling the question:
"We can't seem to find your number"
I hate this power play
I wait an hour late and now he says:
"hey david, wow, it's great to meet ya!
We wish to feature your band in our plans
In the distant future
Cheers dave, that's it, now see ya!"
You what? this is the meeting?
You've already finished with speaking?
You better give it a rethink
I'm a minute from screaming
Look, I wake up really early
And came all the way here from birmingham
Paid my way, it was dear in sterling
I may as well have been burning them
This is a lesson I'm learning:
Give and get zip in return with them
Screw suits, producers, what are they selling?
All the cash and none of the talent

I know you think you know
What we'd do for that gold
Your talk is cheap and old
So please just save it
