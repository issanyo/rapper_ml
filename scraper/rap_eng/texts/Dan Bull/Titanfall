[Verse 1]
Hop in the titan
With the aim of stopping them striking
I'm not going to lie
It'll probably get properly violent
You should eat your greens
Because you're lacking in iron, man
I don't mean to talk beanstalks
But I'm jacking your giant
I've seen gore beyond belief
War machines torn up like magazines
Fragged to smithereens with C4
Rock you like a see-saw
Rucking's what I breath for
Drop you into free fall
And pop you when you respawn
Free running and free gunning
Among the debris, becoming elite
Keep running your mouth
I'll separate your gum and your teeth
I find it funny you keep
Coming back for more
Like Oliver Twist did
When he risked it
Cause he really wanted something to eat

[Hook]
Are you big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?
Reckon you're big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?

[Verse 2]
You're talking all that
While I'm ignoring, walking tall
While I'm taking great strides
You were barely taught to crawl
I'm a fighter personified
Warts and all
You've never fought a war
In all your life
Why, we all can brawl
You've not got the balls
To drop and fall
Hop from wall to wall
Adrenaline is setting in
A veritable smorgasboard
Of fluids running through you
Like a sewer or a waterfall
You're short of all the gall you need
And so you're sure to fall
Check my vortex blocker
It could more or less stop a chopper
While I take a break to make a mocha
Make a mockery of you
You can't refuse
I made an offer
Leave you shaking, quaking
Mate, you need to take your beta blockers

[Hook]
Are you big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?
Reckon you're big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?


[Verse 3]
Yeah, I think you're rather justified
In feeling mugged off
Every attack you tactically attacked with
Atlas shrugged off
So spray me with de-Ogre-ant
That stuff just rubs off
I stride up in my Stryder
And tear your lugs off
My smart pistol is ripping
And pulling apart gristle
Leave a dark ripple in your chest
You need kevlar nipples
I blast missiles at trolls
For laughs, giggles and lulz
So I wouldn't advise getting involved
If you're not MLG
MGL
A shower of empty shells
As everyone around me's
Shredded into bits
And sent to hell
No one's ever started something with me
That ever ended well
Whatever pilot or titan tried it
In the end they fell

[Hook]
Are you big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?
Reckon you're big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?

Are you big enough?
Tell me are you big enough to ruck with me?
Reckon you're big enough?
Come and have a go, I'll knock you off your feet
