[Intro]
Seriously though
So
The people have spoken
And nobody's really sure what they've said
All we can tell is
They want some changes

[Verse 1]
Dear David
So you're taking the reins from Labour
Just don't handle them with force
Or Lady Britannia could fall from her horse
Not all of us are sure whether you're the right fellow
To weather us to port in this storm;
Although I'm sure that when Gordon was brought in
We'd have been better off trying to talk to a wall
You wanted to be seen as the man down the street
Now you're the man in Downing Street
I'm not asking you to live in a glass house
But we'd be glad to see a bit of transparency
Thatcher's been and smashed the glass roof
But now you've got a grass roof - the thatcher's been
You better watch it doesn't catch a beam
From the grassroots camera's gleam because the heat's on
These days when a scandal's seen
It's like there's no smoke without fire, matches please
People are fed up and hate being treated as second rate
They're ready to see a head on a plate
That's not me by the way, we'd get on as mates
But I'm just saying be ready to take it

[Chorus]
That's just the way that it is
(That's just the way it is)
Ah, yeah (Things'll never be the same)
Ooh yeah (That's just the way it is)
Yep (ah yeah)

[Verse 2]
Ay
I see no changes, all I see is eighties faces
Made up with a public relations facelift
And when Cameron's on camera he makes it
Easy to see his patriot's bracelet
Can you blame our aversion to
Another Tony Blair: version two?
You're the person who's serving us
So we deserve a dude we can trust
But you Tories talk about big society
I thought there was no such thing as society
Thatcher's plans for taxes stank
So let's not go back to that;
But right now, the bankers are laughing
Right back to the bank and it's tragic
MPs need to stop spending expenses
On mending expensive fences, it's offensive to the senses
When it comes down to cash incentives
It's senseless how you splash out
But the comments about class are comments without class
There's not a doubt about that

People who need heating don't give a *bleep*
Whether you've been to Eton
They just want you keep them from freezing
In the bleakest seasons it seems to me that we're being cheated
When we see the sleaze who do we believe in?
You need to rethink your reasons
See, we need a leader, not a devious speaker
Eager to keep secrets beneath a veneer
Keeping people in fear for your career
Isn't the reason you're here, I need to to be clear:
We want someone that'll live up to his promises
Not rhetorical oratory delivered from his orifice
I know it's difficult in politics to run an honest ship
There's a lot of bollocks and a lot of spin
To be honest it's an honour list of onanists
More bothered with their image than the problems of the populace
But I promise this: if you stop grinning
And make it your mission to take criticism on the chin
You'll have the confidences of a lot
Who think that we're on the brink of an apocalypse

[Chorus]
Let's stay positive
(That's just the way it is)
It can't be that bad
(Things'll never be the same)
It probably can be that bad, but
(That's just the way it is, ah yeah)
That's just the way it is
Rest in peace, Gordon Brown's carreer
Rest in peace
That's just the way it is
Do y'know what I mean?
