Newspapers strewn
Warm bodies sprawling
Appalling
It'll be in the papers tomorrow morning
Along with mourning
The names of the fallen
Embodied in bold print for you to take as a warning
Never intervene with the American dream
We do whatever for the green
Fill you with lead up in the streets
For that liquid cash
Hot red liquid splash marks
Spattered on your dash then dash
Brash
We bring the hustle
Back to sinew and muscle
Cracked bone
Cracked glass
Cracked windows in the tussle
Flash ringing from the muzzle
'Til you're cinders in the rubble
I don't value pigs unless they're sniffing for the Truffles
I'm singing for the struggle
What you bringing to the scuffle?
I'm about to come and stick a pin into your bubble
Here's a cop killer for your trouble
Blood spattered on the asphalt
But it doesn't matter
Rat a tat tat
Fuck a black mask
When death is entertainment then I'd better act daft
Like the Beatles on the rooftop
The police'll never let it be or get me to stop
You or me are going to soon drop
Down a staircase flight or fire escape
To a violent fate
Fight or flight kick in right away
Rotate
But there's no turning back
You're going to roast
Flames are going to burn your back
Murder rap
I'm sure you've heard of that
This is the real deal
No limit to who we'll do in and what we'll steal
And if you feel ill
Then you can go away
This is the USA
If you can't take it you'll be thrown away
But if you don't back down you'll be blown away
Your wife'll tell your kids "Daddy isn't coming home today"
Mayday!
Mayday!
The situation's getting cray cray
I'm Jesse James in his heyday
I'll face your grenades, melee weapons, AKs
Arrange the date of your funeral
And the wake is my payday
They'll say that you were brave, pray
For the angels to change
The state's got to save face
I say grace
Cos tonight you dine in paradise
While I take a plane
Hijack a flight to Paraguay
I can't taste the prepackaged airline meal
And I can't say what the Hell I feel
You made a dogs dinner
On a dog day afternoon
I must be off, sorry
But I'm going have to shoot
Said You made a dogs dinner
On a dog day afternoon
I must be off, sorry
But I'm going have to shoot!
In God We Trust...
