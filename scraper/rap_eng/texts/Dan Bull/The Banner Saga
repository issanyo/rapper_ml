[Intro]
The Gods...
The Gods are dead

[Verse 1]
The whole world as we've come to know it is broken
Since the sun's eye blinked shut and never opened
The lakes, plains and the oceans are frozen
The Gods are dead
Yet someone over us has spoken, saying
Fill up the flagons
Pack the wagons
And advance the Caravan
Through arid lands
Narrow valleys
Parry avalanches
Trudging through the snow
Clutching to the hope
That we'll be crunching dredge to slush
As we deliver crushing blows

[Chorus]
The drum beat threads pointed needles
With the noise of a big hammer
The saga of our paths entwined
Embroidered in the Banner
So wave your Banners high
Make them fan the sky
Though you're just as much a mortal man as I
We do not plan to die

[Verse 2]
I am Rook
I do things by the book
Since childhood I toed the line that Iver took
I've seen vile things;
Grunts, rapping gruff rhymes
Skalflings
Varl Kings
From the Gruin Sea to Groffheim
Meet me at the Mead House at three bells
I need a Siege Archer and a Shieldbanger
See my renown
Can you hear the thunder?
By the Beard of Dundr
Gods know the Godstone's got me crying tears of wonder

[Bridge]
Night is here, and thus we must find a bed to slumber
I am but a Hunter
Liable for providing
For fighting fit men numbering a hundred
Fighting fits of hunger
I must guide lumbering Varl
Or risk lying ripped asunder

[Chorus]
The drum beat threads pointed needles
With the noise of a big hammer
The saga of our paths entwined
Embroidered in the Banner
So wave your Banners high
Make them fan the sky
Though you're just as much a mortal man as I
We do not plan to die

[Verse 3]
On the first day the Earth quakes
Your nerves shake
But your fate is certain
No need to let your reserve break
You must assert;
Bravery and an alert brain
Will serve to save you from a world of hurt
And will avert pain
Marching ever forward
No rest, lest we be cornered
Tortured then slaughtered
Hung, drawn and quartered
Bellower will see the error of his ways ever so soon
When we thread his dread and terror's weft
Back into Mother's loom

[Chorus]
The drum beat threads pointed needles
With the noise of a big hammer
The saga of our paths entwined
Embroidered in the Banner
So wave your Banners high
Make them fan the sky
Though you're just as much a mortal man as I
We do not plan to die

Wave your banners high
Make them fan the sky
Though you're just as much a mortal man as I
We do not plan to die
