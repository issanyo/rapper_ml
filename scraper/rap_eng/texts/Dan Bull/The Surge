[Intro]
I've got this
I've got this
I've got this

[Verse 1]
I'm slowly roasting under the solar rays
Been stuck in this hole for days
What virtuoso made the oh-so great proposal
Of drones with blades
Hey, don't separate my nose and face
My looks will go to waste
I was low a moment ago
But pain's a way to motivate
I don't suppose they'll float away
So I'll make a new way to negotiate
I, turn over the page with no delay
I'm my own protege
I'm a dark soul with two hard shoulders
Known as the motorway
So don't you dare overtake
Or you'll need a new coat of paint
Severing extremities is a clever method
We use to lose a load of weight
Your tech's like your culture:
Free for me to go and appropriate
Those flows provoke debate
Blowing up at an explosive rate
So debased I won't associate with you
You're overrated
I'd prefer to go on a date
With a moldy plate of roast potatoes
Craving so voracious I could float in space
And won't be weightless
How the heck did I get so big?
Sticking tech to my exo rig
But it's never sufficient
I'm already getting ready for the next growth
So let's go dig

[Hook]
Never mind the gods and their schemes
We are the cogs in their machine
The wildest fighting dogs you've ever seen
Blood
Petrol
Metal
Sweat and dreams

[Verse 2]
Adapt to stress, disaster
Like a committed method actor
No happy ever after
A vicious metal raptor
With the extra X factor
Collecting tech scrap for
The aptitudes I have to yet master
Get faster
Test, you'll get your neck snapped
So It's messed up like It's Glen Baxter's sketchpad
That's drenched in alphabet pasta
Sepp blatter
Deceptive bastard
Fully fledged engine of vengeful havoc
A tragic ending's pending
When you're a drunk trying to enter traffic
Shrapnel spins severed limbs
Liquidating everything
From megaliths
To insignificant details we see the devil in
We go to the CREO party
Dismantle the demonarchy
Don't start when you can't complete
Or your arteries will receive no heartbeat

[Hook]
Never mind the gods and their schemes
We are the cogs in their machine
The wildest fighting dogs you've ever seen
Blood
Petrol
Metal
Sweat and dreams

[INSTRUMENTAL]

[Verse 3]
I've got this

Someone call a doctor
I've got this

Doctor, I've got this urge
But I'm lost for words
Feel like I'm on the verge of popping off
Do not disturb
Call off the search
I've lost my nerve
Giving you just desserts
I'm kicking you off of the kerb
My golly gosh, that must have hurt

[Hook]
(Never mind!)
Never mind the gods and their schemes
We are the cogs in their machine
The wildest fighting dogs you've ever seen
Blood
Petrol
Metal
Sweat and dreams
