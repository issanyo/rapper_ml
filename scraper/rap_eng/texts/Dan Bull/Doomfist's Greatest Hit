[Intro: Dan Bull]
I'm coming in now

[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
This game's got a new twist
If you missed it
Let's do this
I'll introduce you to the dude gifted with huge mitts
It's Doomfist
When the tune shifts
And that boom hits
Then you get smacked
Through bricks flat
So cubist art critics are all asking you
"Ooh, who did that?"
Who mixes better metaphors that are fitting like a glove
If the shoe fits
Bruv, do you lift?
There's too many bloos in the queue
Shift
Move it or he'll use his Q shift
In two clicks your noob pick
Will be a view from the cliffs on Route 66
It's a true privilege
He picked you to hit

[Chorus: Tay Zonday]
Every battle galvanizes the powerful
Weakness is a trait we won't tolerate or allow for
It's survival of the fittest, ruling with an iron fist
And pulverizing fools who try and resist
Every battle galvanizes those who merit it
Without the winning hand, you're doomed to go uncredited
It's survival of the worthy, gain control over the earth
Those who don't deserve a role are thrown into a world of hurt

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
Everybody trying to stop his nasty plans
For a piece of the pie
Will catch these hands in a meteor strike
Don't need guns, got these guns
Don't need reasons
Don't see a need to be tooled up
He's crushing any fool 'til they're all dust
That isn't an arm, it's a school bus
Garnished with the pulled tusks of a walrus
Here's an announcement and a mouthful
He's sure more than a scoundrel
Employed at the Talon council
As a bouncer and a councilor
Man, it's doubtful you're not down for the count
Pound for pound
He's pounding you out
'Til you're shouting for someone to help
Don't look at me, call somebody else
Running your mouth
You're running a gauntlet
You'll get a suddenly sore lip
And a broken nose running like a faucet
So cork it or get launched into orbit
Awkward
When the straw poll's closed and all's told
There's no poor soul more swole
Punching a borehole in the North Pole
Split your wig fourfold
Warhol

[Chorus: Tay Zonday]
Every battle galvanizes the powerful
Weakness is a trait we won't tolerate or allow for
It's survival of the fittest, ruling with an iron fist
And pulverizing fools who try and resist
Every battle galvanizes those who merit it
Without the winning hand, you're doomed to go uncredited
It's survival of the worthy, gain control over the earth
Those who don't deserve a role are thrown into a world of hurt

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
Straight outta Nigeria
Criteria: strike fear in the mind of inferiors
You might experience serious harm to your insides and interiors
Period
You might be curious why he really doesn't like gorrilas
And it's quite clearly
Because he was confined for years
In a tight area by Winston, now he's quite furious
Poor Winston, Winston's sad
And now poor Winston's mad
He's been stung bad
Coming in for the world's biggest fist bump
Sit on that
Big strong lad with a big strong jab
King Kong in combat
With the chimps, they never should have picked on Ak
Do you reckon that they're gonna live long?
Nah
It's knuckle crunch time
One size fits all
He won't be sticking it where the sun shines
It's sore
I saw a rocket punch that put me off my lunch like
A bunch of fives in a row, that's a punchline
No other stomach in this planet with a dozen pack
His guns are cannons, hooks are savage
Like this custom track is, plus he's black
Not that it matters, I just thought I'd add it 'cause it was a fact
Such a subtle language
Plus a massive knuckle sandwich
Double damage
Fingers like shovels
Slamming fists down like a shuttle landing
Smashing the toughest skull to fragments
Like they're dud ceramics
Running up and uppercutting past your buff mechanics
Slapping you so chuffing fast
It's looking like you've up and vanished

[Chorus: Tay Zonday]
Every battle galvanizes the powerful
Weakness is a trait we won't tolerate or allow for
It's survival of the fittest, ruling with an iron fist
And pulverizing fools who try and resist
Every battle galvanizes those who merit it
Without the winning hand, you're doomed to go uncredited
It's survival of the worthy, gain control over the earth
Those who don't deserve a role are thrown into a world of hurt
