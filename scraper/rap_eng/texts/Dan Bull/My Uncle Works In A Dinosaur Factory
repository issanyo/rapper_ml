Calling Doctor Wu

[Part 1]

I am dropping a rhyme on a tropical island
With tropical timing it's not as if i live
The oppulent life full of watches and diamonds
I’ve got to keep trying I've got to keep writing
'cause each of my lines is a genetic code
To open my life up and lighten the load
One drop of amber is like a little globe
To provide the real globe with the life that has flowed
Through its veins its arteries, change has arrived
And it came to party, rave through the night
To the dawn of a day another day another dollar
That i can’t wait to spend make way for tomorrow
Today, if only i could have would have should have
Too late, it goes to show you what another
You may have done pray to the sun
Looking down the barrel of a gun

[Bridge]

Look into an eye that's opening
For the first time you're both seeing
A different side of the coin flip it now
Heads or tails, win or fail, it's a boy, it's a girl
It's a lizard, it's a mammal
It's a bird against the world
A beast of burden clutching pearls like you
Just like you

[Hook]

If you can take a life and make it yours
The life can turn around and take yours
No accord to break of course
You couldn’t shake a set of razor claws
No no no
Nature doesn’t give and doesn't take
It merely says "it’s in my nature"
I hate to burst your bubble but you're made up
Of the same stuff that can make or break you

[Part 2]

Ever closer to the sun we flew, until we landed on the moon
That's one small step for a man, one giant footprint in the sand
Doctor Wu calling Doctor Wu 
Time's almost run out and torn the clock in two
Division among the divisions is hell division of cells division of self
The vision itself is sufficient to sell the decision to salvage
A living thing out of the DNA found at the dig site
And it’s exciting to give life
Because Doctor Wu we're
Reseeding the garden of eden with logic and reason
Now it's god that is grieving and feeling the wrath of a heathen
Do we need to stop the bereavement?
Previously we were heeding his creed
But it's recently been pretty hard to believe him
In god years sixty five million is just an awkward moment
But when you're caught up in the jaws of dinosaurs
I dont think it's time to talk atonement
Today, if only i could have would have should have
Too late, it goes to show you what another
You may have done pray to the sun
Looking down the barrel of a gun

[Bridge]

Look into an eye that's opening
For the first time you're both seeing
A different side of the coin flip it now
Heads or tails, win or fail, it's a boy, it's a girl
It's a lizard, it's a mammal
It's a bird against the world
A beast of burden clutching pearls like you
Just like you

[Part 3]

Doctor Wu calling Doctor Wu
There's not a lot of time to lose with all we've got to do
For the opportunity forwarding science
And forming alliances more than divine
It's awesome to find new forms of life
Four or five more new species hybrid dinosaurs
Each alive inspiring awe

[Hook]

If you can take a life and make it yours
The life can turn around and take yours
No accord to break of course
You couldn't shake a set of razor claws
No no no
Nature doesn't give and doesn't take
It merely says "it's in my nature"
I hate to burst your bubble but you're made up
Of the same stuff that can make or break you
