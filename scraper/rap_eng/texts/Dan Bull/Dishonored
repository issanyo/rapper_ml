[Verse]
Left to fester in a prison cell
This is living hell
But I've never been a fellow to just sit and dwell
On how they set me up
Said I killed the empress
My will for vengance
Somewhat similar to my skills: it's endless
Distill the tension
Build momentum
'til the thrill's tremendous
I'm going to bring a world of pain to them
That's real relentless
They'll feel horrendous in their final living seconds
A cold breath on their shoulder as death beckons
And shows them in this most fleeting of moments
There's no grave
Their remains are feeding the rodents
Now those close to them
Are grieving and broken
I leave the bereaved
With my deepest condolence
That's one more completed atonement
Closer to the Lord Regent
My meanest opponent
He's a treasonous Caesarless Brutus
Jesus, he's the evilest elitist Judas
He is leaving us deseased
I don't believe it's Lupus
These streets are heaving with the Weepers
Who are really ruthless
The old boys' club in an all-boys school
They control all of Dunwall
The Tallboys rule
I'm after Lady Boyle
So pass the baby oil
You need your nappy changing, man
My rapping made you soil
Defacation
From a blend of dread and veneration
Of an assassinating rapper's devastation
A declaration
Destination: desolation
Defamation of your delegation
Desecration
Desparation
A dedication
To the deprivating
Deformating
Depredation of your nation
Detonation
My reputation precedes me
Like I was played in a demonstration at E3
You couldn't easily beat me
I rake in loads of bone charms
Believe me, I'm beastly
I'll break your bones in both arms

[Chorus]
Tonight
I'm bringing Dunwall to life
As I walk on water
Through walls of light
You heard the king
As the urchins sing
Revenge solves everything
Tonight
I'm bringing Dunwall to life
As I walk on water
Through walls of light
You heard the king
As the urchins sing
Revenge solves everything
Tonight
I'm bringing Dunwall to life
As I walk on water
Through walls of light
You heard the king
As the urchins sing
Revenge solves everything
Tonight
I'm bringing Dunwall to life
As I walk on water
Through walls of light
You heard the king
As the urchins sing
Revenge solves everything
