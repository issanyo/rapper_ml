[Verse 1]
I am nobody
I am everybody
Heaven forbid that any killer could be better than me
You'll never see me
I'm chameleon
Premium
I could be bohemian or deviant
Or dressed up as a chef experimenting with deadly ingredients
My rope'll tighten up your vocal cords like breathing helium
I am not evil, I'm relieving you from tedium
With anesthesia that's really rather lethal than convenient
Keenly clinical
Cold, clean
He isn't a criminal
He's cleaning up the whole scene
Keep it minimal
Turn believers cynical
Certain that i will achieve my goal, reach the pinnacle
Be it difficult, formidable or physical
Every killing's critical
To a level that's spiritual
I stay subliminal
May as well be invisible
Never leave a shred of evidence, I'm not empirical

[Hook]
I am nobody
I am everybody
Don't remember when there was someone who ever loved me
I am nobody
Yet there's forty seven of me
Blend in like a true clone
End them and collect the money
X2

[Verse 2]
I have no relatives
Collateral or leverage to pressure with
So you'll never give a hemorrhage
My only blood ties round my neck with elegance
I'm educated in the etiquette of decadence
Any chemical elements are potentially venomous
Even adrenaline has benefits
And when it hits
I can taste the blood of Christ in the sacrifice
He made through the sacrament
To save us in the afterlife
Every soul is sacred so no one has to die
I just changed the pace of the roll when I cast the die
Fate, hear the pastor cry
You may be a mastermind
But if you're my prey then there's no chance you'll last the night

[Hook]
I am nobody
I am everybody
Don't remember when there was someone who ever loved me
I am nobody
Yet there's forty seven of me
Blend in like a true clone
End them and collect the money
