[Verse 1]
When I was little I wanted to be a rockstar
But I thought playing guitar would be rock hard
Taught myself a couple of chords but never got far
So instead I picked a mic up and dropped bars
And I’ve done alright, my rhymes are more tight
Than the average, I tell you that isn’t a pork pie
But please give me a minute, let me be forthright
I wish I’d had the foresight to give my fingers more time
Instead I let them get bored, on the fretboard
But now I’ve found a course, and got it cracked like a fault line
I learnt less in all my life than in the last fortnight
Propelled my elevation level as if it was cordite
Now I can hack at my axe, and rock it all night
If rock is a thrill ride, then Rocksmith’s your tour guide
Of course I’ve still got to put the time into it
But the fact is with practice, I know I can do it

[Hook]
Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
Never mind pressing buttons
I know how to pluck strings
Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
I never dreamed
I’d be able to play such things

[Verse 2]
Unlike the Deftones, I was tone def
Leppards never change their spots, I’m just a radiohead
Music left me with an aching head, not a head rush
Crimson red blush, less trust then Jeb Bush
I’m not an early riser, could never rise against
The procrastination, it was always I versus them
I couldn’t find a muse, or iron out the kinks
I could kiss goodbye to screaming females, I was jinxed
Wanted to slay em ike I’m waving a katana
Or magic wands, make a splashh, take them to Nirvana
Play in my pyjamas, as heavy as a monster truck
Never mind the who, what, why, no-one wants to suck
The police in Boston aren’t even as tough as this
RSI, callouses and blisters, I’ve suffered it
But I’ll never stop playing guitar
Until all that remains of my nails are scars

[Hook x2]
Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
Never mind pressing buttons
I know how to pluck strings
Now I’m a Rocksmith
I learned a lot quick
I never dreamed
I’d be able to play such things
