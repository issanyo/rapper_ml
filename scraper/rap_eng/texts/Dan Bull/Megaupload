[Verse]
Oh bugger! Noes!
Megaupload's cover's blown!
Even without SOPA, they're never coming home
Although, it's good to see America's priority is
Fostering a trustworthy relationship overseas
Make money giving away things for free (ah!)
Why can the majors do similarly?
See, it seems silly to me not to persecute
The perpetraitor, but the method of delivery (wee!)
And if indeed it's true
Then we need to shoot
The postman for evil deeds we do (ooh!)
And should you receive a nasty letter
Then Bang!
I hope Postman Pat gets better
Seize his red van, vivisect his cat
Burn all the letters in his sack, you'll never get them back
If ever that did happen there'd be revolution in Greendale
Retribution and we've failed

Unless we take a stand, make a plan
And for legal reasons I better clarify that I'm not inciting any criminal activity whatsoever, merely civil protest to show that I'm just rather annoyed about the fact that I use Megaupload to host my own album
And now the majors have taken it down - what?
How the hell is this supposed to be helping independent artists
Grow to be healthily self sufficient?
Well - it isn't
Given that your only future sell is in a prison
But I'll tell you now there's a million similar sites
You could shut one down every night and never stem the tide
So with regards to Megaupload
I suggest we get a truckload of files and set them up so that
We can prove the internet isn't a place for disrespect
And if we stick together, they'll never disconnect

[Outro]
Us
From it
Hopefully
With any luck
Blimey
It's a bit of a bugger, isn't it?
