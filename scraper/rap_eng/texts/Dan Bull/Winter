Sleep through nuclear winter
And rest
Heal, reinforce, hold on
And rise

Welcome to your kingdom
Your paradi**
Welcome to your kingdom
Your paradi**

Bye bye bye

In heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything is fine
In heaven everything is fine
You got your good things
And you got mine
In heaven everything is fine
