[Verse 1]
Listen
Imagine Dan sat in the back of an ambulance
Chatting to Adam and telling him that he's had enough of this madness
Fuck if that actually happened I haven't the faintest clue
The concussion had damaged my grey matter and mushed my brain to goo
But when I unravelled the bandage to see my face anew
My eyes' vacant gaze described what I should aim to do
And that's whatever the fuck it takes to make it through
Enough pussying about, now I'm a sabretooth, and nature's brutal
In the old days I used to
Say I didn't need to pay my dues
Ha - how far was I away from truth?
And in the old days I used to wait for opportunities to happen
Now I make my opportunities and grab them

[Hook]
What doesn't kill will not make you stronger
But at least you're going to live a little longer
So take everything right on the chin
And never ever ever give in

[Verse 2]
I was nearly a limited edition
Because I could have been swimming with the fishes
But being in critical condition
Would give me the volition
To fulfill my mission as a skilled musician, ambition:
Kill competition with my ill compositions
And then build my position up until I'm a religion
(Roll up, roll up)
My shirt sleeves, I see the vision
Turn the key in the ignition
Burn and speed into the distance
Even if it means you're gonna be in a collision
Well at least you've given us a firm reason to listen
Desert the feeble disposition
Learn to feed on criticism
Spurn the media's derision
Earn your keep and keep on living
Hurting people is a piece of piss
But it requires guts to be kind
I don't know why I didn't see this shit
I must have been blind
But even despite that dust in my eye will never settle
I will never bite the dust 'til I die

[Hook]
What doesn't kill will not make you stronger
But at least you're going to live a little longer
So take everything right on the chin
And never ever ever give in

[Verse 3]
Look - whether you're holding a bunch of roses
Or holding a gun just know this
You've got to soldier on, roll with the punches, throw fists
Keep holding on, lift that boulder on your shoulders strong
Souls are one thing, but the body's been evolving long
Before you ever knew the pain
It's hurting me
Recuperation is a state of elevation
Gave me endless days to meditate and strengthen every failing I had
Being a patient gave me patience and determination
Dedication to bettering Dan
Man, I've taken beatings, taken knees to the face
My bloodstream stained the streets of this place
Where I reside, seeped through the pavement
Making me a piece of the neighbourhood
Could you keep it more real than me right there if you tried?
From the stitches in my elbow to the tears in my side
My scars are badges of honour, I bear them with pride
They stitched my scalp, fixed my split eyebrow
And another time they took out a bit of my bowel
Being a patient gave me patience and determination
Helped me to see a way out of the maze, found an escape
Came out of the daze
How many ways more will I be knocked to the ground, now?
But they named me Danny Boy
Because you're never going to keep me down

[Hook]
