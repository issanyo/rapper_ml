[Intro]
Ay
Look

[Verse 1]
Who's the man dropping the rap?
It's Ned Stark
I rule the land on top of the map
I got a head start, Bloodclart
I'm the Lord and Warden of the North
From the border to the wall I rule it all
Food for thought
And who'd have thought a King could bring a tune as raw
A regal troubador whose keep's a music hall
He speaks the truth on beats and proves to you he knew the lore
But I'm Ã¼ber-sure that's nothing you never knew before
I drop real lyrics
And that's a fact of life you might not feel but it's that I've got skill And this is why I rule the roads like tribes off hills
There was a guy I'd got to kill from the Night's Watch; Will
Hah, what a shite talker warning about White Walkers
Bedtime stories I ought to tell to my daughters
And regarding family matters: Family matters
Hassle my family and I'm having your knackers

[Chorus]
So foes of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming
The enemies of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming

[Verse 2]
I'm handling thing with the standard I bring
Would you expect less from the Hand of the King
Who's cold enough to let Joffrey give Sansa the Ring, think?
My standing's as grand as young Bran on his legs
So I head to King's Landing demanding respect
Or there'll be payback like a Lannister's debt
Since Baratheon's passing, the palace bereft
Of a king 'til the crown is on Stannis' head
But then I take heed of what Varys had said
Revealing the reason why John Arryn is dead
Barriston and I began to suspect a plan
To defect that the Lannisters evidently ran in effect
Baratheon spoke aloud his last letter
And I accurately wrote it down to the last letter
Just miss a little bit out, now that's better
Keep Joffrey off the hotseat
The little pecker

[Chorus]
Foes of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming
The enemies of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming

[Verse 3]
That letter from the High King was ripped up by the bitch herself
Despite the prison cell in which I dwell
I'm still the Lord of Winterfell
You're still a horde of infidels
So give me your support as king or else we'll storm the citadel
Flipping hell, this a tale I may not live to tell
'Cause one does not simply...
Wait, that was Rivendell
There isn't Elves in this story at all
And now I've gone and broke character, it's damaging the Fourth Wall
It happens when I'm dropping off the top of my head
Until my head is dropping off and I'm dead
You've been rocking with Ned
Probably the best to drop in all of Westeros
At least I guess I was until my head was lost

[Chorus]
Foes of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming
The enemies of Winterfell best start running
And brace yourselves, Ned Stark's coming

[Outro]
Watch the throne
