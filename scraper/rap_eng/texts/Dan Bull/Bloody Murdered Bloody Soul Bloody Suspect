[Verse 1]
My name’s Detective Ronan O’Connor
In my line of work, I’m facing death daily
But now it’s me who’s a goner
In Salem P.D. of all the homicides, Lord
I’d never say that it’d be me lying on the sidewalk
But whatever I thought, it’s become irrelevant
My skeleton’s regressing through the elements
And evidently, I’m undead ‘til I seek and get the evidence
One foot in the grave has made me one step ahead of him
I’ll make him taste his own medicine: the Bell Killer
Devout sinner, I doubt we’re dealing with a swell fella
How did it happen? I need help with it
Throw the laws of physics out the window, go to town with it
I can walk through substances to suss out who the suspect is
But can’t discuss or talk about the subject with them ‘cause I must exist
I’m an ethereal, pulp noir serial star
But this is real despite appearing immaterial

[Bridge]
I can’t explain it, I’m on a hunt for the truth
To why my assailant made me plummet from under the roof
Salem is a place containing hundreds of clues
And my presumption is that somewhere in it somebody goofed

[Hook]
Woke up in a murder scene, a ghost interred in Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me
Woke up in a murder scene, interred in Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me
Murder scene, Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me

[Verse 2]
How can I trust girls I find in the Dusk World?
Its dank musty musk must just blur lines
Slur words, disrupt and usurp minds
A corruption of the worst kind
But I need all the aid that I can find
Between mediums and demons, I will mainly have to pry
Maybe have to find, a shady patch and hide
From their crazy appetite, I’m not a tasty snack, am I?
I've already made the sacrifice of life
And the fact is I would like to not have to die twice
My mind keeps rewinding back to that night
The facts of what happened don’t just stack up quite right

[Bridge]
I can’t explain it, I’m on a hunt for the truth
To why my assailant made me plummet from under the roof
Salem is a place containing hundreds of clues
And my presumption is that somewhere in it somebody goofed

[Hook]
Woke up in a murder scene, a ghost interred in Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me
Woke up in a murder scene, interred in Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me
Murder scene, Purgatory
A dude determined to determine who has murdered me

[Outro]
Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit?
Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit?
Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit?
Whodunit? Who-a-whodunit?
