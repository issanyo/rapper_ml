[Intro]
Hahahaha
Rhino Tank God
Ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
There's a few things that I wanna say
To the game company named Rockstar (-star, ayy)
I've been playing GTA since '98
So I've been down with you lot right from the start (the start)
When running over Hare Krishnas
Was rewarded with the sound "Gouranga!" (-ranga)
I learnt swearing thanks to you, if I hadn't
I'd still be saying "Gosh, darn" (gosh darn, by Jove, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 2]
Played the story mode of GTA V
Every day, all summer, got far (got far, ayy)
Then it glitched, I lost my progress, I was pissed
Had a face like a slapped arse (slapped arse, ayy)
Plus quit GTA Online 'cause hackers got free stuff
For which I got charged (got charged, ayy)
Wasted every penny of my money
On a Megalodon shark card (shark card)

[Verse 3]
There's some more stuff that I wanna say
To the game company named Rockstar (-star, ayy, ayy)
How come you don't bother using the face engine
You used in LA Noire? (-A Noire)
It was such a cool way to incorporate the faces
Of real actors (actors)
Their expressions were as entertaining
As when Jack Thompson got disbarred
He was so annoying, blaming all the violence on games
Saying GTA was the way murderers had been trained
Saying "I want it banned" (ayy, ayy)
Kind of like how you never made a PC Red Dead Redemption
And even despite the undeniable demand
You're disappointing the fans (yeah, ayy)

[Verse 4]
One final thing that I want to say
To the game company named Rockstar (-star)
Why you never made another Grand Theft Auto
That is set in London? (London)
Now you're based in New York, you forgot your humble roots
In Edinburgh (-burgh)
Or Dundee, I couldn't tell from my research
But definitely in Scotland (Scotland)

[Verse 5]
Is it bad that I just wanna hear a pedestrian
Shouting "tosser"? (tosser)
Swearing like a British person is at risk
Of becoming a lost art (lost art)
Wouldn't it be fun to hear the word "wanker"
More often in the pop charts? (pop charts)
That's currently the end of the list
Of things I want to say to Rockstar (-star)

[Outro]
I'm singing the same melody as before
But transposed by an octave (-ave)
(Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar, Rockstar)
