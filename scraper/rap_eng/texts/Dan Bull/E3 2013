[Dan Bull]
We're on a plane to L.A
And we're never gonna stop
Beatboxing with my ear
When the drum goes pop

Horrible zombies
And hurtful plants
So we're gonna need a World of Tanks

As you can see
I'm not quite as tall
As this robot from Titanfall

If you don't like The Witcher
You can probably dismiss this
But I just got a lolly from witches

We're about to get onto the escalator
You haven't got a pass
So I'll check you later

People in queues?
Flipping sod those
Get out of my way
Like fish in CoD: Ghosts

They've been queueing for t-shirts
Since yesterday
Looks like it's gonna be their Destiny

What's in the next M.G.S.?
Only Snake'll know
Castlevania looks like
A Game of Thrones

Elder Scrolls is amazing
No lag at all
I'm holding the mace of Molag Bal

Bethesda is repping Elder Scrolls Online
But don't forget about Wolfenstein

Activision are back to back with Blizzard
Dat Division

[Toby Turner]
I'm freestyling
My style is free
Actually, I...
Paid a fee
For the clothes that you see
I'm here at E3 2013
You know what I mean
'Cause I said it in English
Mm-hmmm
Sometimes I sing-lish
Woo hoo hoo hoo ho
For no reason
Singing singing for no reason, it's the season
For the re... a... r... r... ra...
...Treason
That rhymes, mother...

[Dan Bull]
Man, my rhymes are tighter than Busta's
Standing side to side with Tobuscus

Sonic at the top
Like a boss hog
Everybody's getting watched
Like in Watch Dogs

Xbox privacy?
That is a delusion
Fake, Mickey Mouse
Castle of Illusion

I burnt my forehead
It's pink as hell
I should have kept under cover
Splinter Cell

Diablo three'll make me crazy and scared
Like I've just seen an alien
Where?

I've been bitten by a zombie
That'll feel raw
So what am I still on the Battlefield for?

Soon it's gonna be a dark night
Batman
Let's go, I'm hungry
Pac-Man
