[Verse 1]
I am a father, unto the son of a deity
The day I sailed that river into Hades, I must pay a fee
I lost a daughter, but saw her when I crossed the water
Rushed toward her
And caught but nothing more than dust
The torture of what awful daunting dawn's
The force always propelling me
Forward through the mourning tune
Still haunted by her melody
I'm humble in the shadow of my father's legacy
Inheriting his sentiments
That once I thought I'd never see
Reassessing then amending my identity
In light of the descendent seed
That destiny has sent for me

[Pre-Chorus]
He needs his father
His father needs his son
And so we march on deeper
'Til the final deed is done

[Chorus]
I am my father's son
I am the father of my son
Who's father's father's son
Is farther from his father than his son
I am my father's son
I am the father of my son
Who's father's father's son
Is farther from his father than his son

[Verse 2]
My son's a piece of me
I've become so pleased to see him
Cleaving a beast to pieces
Like he's a piece of meat for eating
Each and every lesson is ample
I need to be there to set an example
To mop up the mess
And untangle the web
That not every man can accept even handle
He needs his father
Each eve is darker than the previous
Harking to the deepest depths
Of Tartarus where they're leaving us
I need to see his future
Pleading, bartering with Prometheus
Can he see us?
I want to swathe my babe
In the armour of Odysseus
Can't safeguard or guarantee
He stays from harm's way
He might stray
And every night i'm away
From his light is a dark day
That I can't take
To take him away would leave part of me numb
I'd rather be done
Rather be hung
Drawn and Quartered
Than the thought of a fatherless son

[Pre-Chorus]
He needs his father
His father needs his son
And so we march on deeper
'Til the final deed is done
He needs his father
His father needs his son
And so we march on deeper
'Til the final deed is done

[Chorus]
I am my father's son
I am the father of my son
Who's father's father's son
Is farther from his father than his son
I am my father's son
I am the father of my son
Who's father's father's son
Is farther from his father than his son

[Verse 3]
Your low status own case has no basis
So face it
I'm crumbling it like oat cakes
'Cause you're bumbling and it shows
Race with no brakes or low stakes
Don't be slow paced, life won't wait
For the death dance
And when I throw shapes
They rotate 'til a bone breaks
Though blows rain
Don't show pain
I'm poe faced
Not for my own sake
But for that of my son
Aim to be so brave
So sow grain and restow grace
When I show faith, I showcase
We can both brace our unknown fates
Like snowflakes that float straight over boats, lakes
Any location
The flow takes us
So the day that smoke makes us choke
They will know Kratos rose Atreus
My god, those flows
Gracious
Brace yourself for even more
'Cause I'm only getting started
These flows aren't for the faint hearted
I'm a great Skarl spinning bardic tales
Big as hearts of whales
Splitting waves like a shark fin
Making a mark
In a state of the art way
Making you pray
For the lately departed
Painting a stark image
Raising up our kid
While trying to tame all the rage of a Spartan
Can't list all the ways that i'm hurtin
The play's just starting
They're raising the curtain
How can a father make way for his heir
Well there's only really ever one way to be certain

[Chorus]
I am my father's son
I am the father of my son
Whose's father's father's son
Is farther from his father than his son
I am my father's son
I am the father of my son
Whose's father's father's son
Is farther from his father than his son
