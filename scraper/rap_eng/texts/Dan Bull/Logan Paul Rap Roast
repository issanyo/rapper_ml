So, is anyone surprised to know that Logan Paul's
Uploaded a video that's broken social protocol?
Vlogging at a hanging scene as if it was the local mall
'Cause hanging with your bros and cracking jokes matters most of all
Is there ever an unspoken thought that doesn't pass that oaken jaw?
It's time to give this showman's mode of promo an overhaul
I'll rip your torso open raw, grip your pulse's frozen core
Shove it in the oven with the other leftover roasts to thaw
I thought you were the most mature and grown up Paul brother
You know, the secret favourite one of both of your mother?
I'm sure that you probably even disappointed Jake
But this is insignificant, there's an even bigger point to make

Real life isn't a video, not everything is content
The absence of a no doesn't equal consent
Some things are better left unsaid or unsent
Sometimes making the right choice might even lose you one cent
Once I filmed an accident, a jeep came off an overpass
Landed on another car below with an explosive crash
It could have been a hit on Reddit, but I didn't share it
'Cause there were real people injured and it didn't merit

Me exhibiting their tragedy like it was entertainment
So when I read you did the same I put my pen to paper
Not that it's my place to stick my nose in
But I'm getting sick of the excuses of those few who condone it
Saying "But he's already dead, he's not even aware of it"
That's true, but imagine if you were that fellow's relative
Logging on to see the news of your missing loved one
And seeing the noose and you giggling, it's just wrong

And the fact that you censored his face
Doesn't change the basic reason that you went to the place
You say you went to look for ghosts? Ghosts aren't real
But suicide is and those wounds can't heal
And if you can't feel you've overstepped a boundary
And if you can't say sorry without shouting "It's about me"
And if you can't comprehend the respect that you lost today
Then Logan bro, I don't know what to say

Your apology was hollow, a borrowed piece of sorrow
Hoping the drama would just become obsolete tomorrow
If you really meant to raise awareness of a thing this sensitive
How come the tags you added didn't even mention it?
Instead you picked the words "comedy" and "maverick"
So I'm sorry, but your apology? I'm not having it
Check your head and admit what you were there for
To disrespect the dead and the people that they cared for

You say you were in a moment of shock and couldn't cope with it
Is that the same moment you edited and uploaded it?
Filmed an extra bit, hyped it up and then promoted it
And at that time your mind was telling you to go for it?
Now there's no damn dispute you go for low hanging fruit
But this is still the lowest Logang's produced
Before this happened I was no fan of you
Suspected you were reckless, now I know that it's true
