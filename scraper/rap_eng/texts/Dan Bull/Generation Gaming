[Verse 1]
Monopoly was not for me, chess made me stressed out
So the only way I could get down was with pocket electronics and bleeps
Ever since my Game Boy made toys obsolete
I've been a well behaved boy that played inside and stayed off the street
Yes, I got my electric shocks from Tetris blocks and Mario Land
Though there wasn't much room for much but mushrooms I was the man, man
With a pad in my hand, hammering at it while eating my breakfast
Being the best - that was the plan, beating the rest and leaving them breathless
Please believe me, nobody could beat me at Tetris
I fucking rock, dropping blocks like heads off chopping blocks, I was on some next shit
And I've still got a flame for puzzle games like HD Hexic
But when the PC came my gaming tastes became eclectic

[Chorus]
This day's grim (it's raining), it's raining
What wonderful weather for gaming
The sun's blazing (the sun's blazing) so let's stay in
It's wonderful weather for gaming

[Verse 2]
I was the geeky one, I really wanted a PC CD-ROM, then got it
Eight meg of RAM, a CRT screen, she was some top kit
Free moments were devoted to keystrokes and the odd click
Far more into dark forces than even the Star Wars Kid
And Civilization II's a brilliant game that you really should play and I still do today
Computer games improve your brain, it's proven, mate
So if you behave in stupid ways then please refrain from blaming GTA
I really hate excuses, I may just shoot my teacher's face
Nah, I'm already embroiled in getting these Tesla coils
Ready in my base
The Russians are coming with trucks full of gunmen, I need to be safe
But maybe the Green Beret could lead the way and see us through
At least til we replace the PC games with PS2

[Chorus]
This day's grim (it's raining), it's raining
What wonderful weather for gaming
The sun's blazing (the sun's blazing) so let's stay in
It's wonderful weather for gaming

[Verse 3]
Taking control of somebody else's console with no remorse
I was so debauched, my only thoughts were total scores on Tony Hawk's
Or running amok in Smuggler's Run, smuggling guns and drugs for fun
And pulling a gun on any NPC I see or stumble upon
GTA 3 made me inclined to kill repeatedly
The spinal chills of Silent Hill are still in my mind and creeping me The fuck out, look out! Pull out your sawn-off shotgun
'Cause there's a hot zombie nurse that wants to hurt you and cut off your oxygen
But as much as asphyxiation may be lots of fun
I've got a crush, a fixation with PlayStation - I'm in love
So I said to the PS2, "me and you need a breather"
Then in three clicks I'd ordered an Xbox 360 off eBay

[Chorus]
This day's grim (it's raining), it's raining
What wonderful weather for gaming
The sun's blazing (the sun's blazing) so let's stay in
It's wonderful weather for gaming

[Verse 4]
So we switched teams to the 360, glitch free
Lots of slick features - HD, HDD, I don't miss leads
Gears is my gear but I gets my hits from Hitman
The BioShock has Mass Effect as I sink into Oblivion
Splinter Cell's mint as well and Rainbow Six takes no prisoners
It's the business - and the cover system's fucking wicked!
Ducking and chucking a frag, blind fire from behind piles of rubble and zipping them up in a bag
I'm loving the lack of health packs - putting a plaster on a fracture or a shrapnel gash
What the hell's that? In the new generation of computer gaming
You hold the left trigger half way down or let the computer do the aiming
So what are you complaining for? (The Forza scoreboard's been reset!)
Shut up and improve your Gamerscore before you get the dreaded Red Ring of Death

[Chorus]
This day's grim (it's raining), it's raining
What wonderful weather for gaming
The sun's blazing (the suns blazing), David's raiding
It's wonderful weather for gaming
