[Intro]
Banana
Banana, banana
Banana, banana
I fancy a banana

[Verse 1]
Ay, mankind's finest age
Will be when animals are no longer confined to cages (yeah)
So let's find a way, 'cause
A gorilla isn't a violent ape
Until you give it ammunition, trigger primal rage
Meaning your life's arriving at its final stage
Look, your spine'll break, that's what I'm trying to say
He can suddenly change from all sedate to more enraged
Than a horny Gigantopithecus from a prehistoric age
But his call of nature's way more than just to fornicate
More than brawn, more than brain
Born in jail and enslaved
All the same, saw a way
To maul and break the ball and chain

[Chorus]
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
All gorilla, no filler
Part guerilla killer, part Nobel Prize show winner

[Verse 2]
So when he's setting up a clever experiment (then?)
That's when this fellow's in his chemical element (yeah)
Does everything for the betterment of everybody
To be honest, there's no better buddy, 'cause he's bloody excellent (yeah)
If you're desperate for actual protection
Then I guess that it's the natural selection
No matter whatever you are
It's rare that you're really as hard as a gorilla in armour
We'll win in an instant when Winston's bananas
If you find you're in a dire predicament, don't rely on ignorance
Get the iron fisted scientist to try and fix it up
Normalizing vital signs and firing cylinders to silliness
This is survival of the fittest, gorillas are winning it
Come in his kingdom, killing his kinsmen
You're gonna take an L as big as Hillary Clinton
That's not cool, like calling a Native American an Indian
Or just living in Swindon
What's weirder than the appearance of Tilda Swinton?
All will be revealed, hear me tell the tale of Winston
He's a nutter, hugging a tub of peanut butter
Wrecking the base on any stage like he was Geezer Butler

[Chorus]
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
All gorilla, no filler
Part guerilla killer, part Nobel Prize show winner

[Verse 3]
You might find him in the lab (yeah), writing in a pad
Or outside going quite gorilla mad (rah)
Frightening the baddest of the fighters in the match
'Til they're begging for him to be nerfed
"We'd like another patch!" (eugh)
But it might come back to bite him in the ass
They still find they're coming last, they should try another class
Fact:
When Overwatch comes at you with a giant posse
You'll see gorillas in the midst, Dian Fossey
Doomfist was an opportunist
Ruthless, 'til Winston came along and gave the plot a new twist
Studying a lexigram to journey to the west and grab
A tesla cannon barrier projector, get the best of Talon
Genetically altered to wreck and never falter
Successfully setting up a drone to rock Gibraltar
For Overwatch, it ultimately led to their recovery
Imagination is the essence of discovery

[Chorus]
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
All gorilla, no filler
Part guerilla killer, part Nobel Prize show winner

Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
Whoo!
Bananananananananananananananananas
All gorilla, no filler
Part guerilla killer, part Nobel Prize show winner

[Outro]
Banana, banana
Banana, banana
Banana, banana
Banana, banana
(Banana)
(Banana)
I fancy a banana
