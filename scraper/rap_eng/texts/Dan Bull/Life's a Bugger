[Intro]
Chris, that's enough, start rapping

[Verse 1: Chris Leese]
Realising that life isn't everything that it's meant to be
[?] And changed their destiny
Coincidentally, I'm earning more than the minimum
But failing when I'm saving the pounds cause I keep on spending 'em
Still, I got a mortgage down so that I can afford it
Because now my house even though I'm [?] my shit
Reminiscing as I'm sitting in the kitchen
Bout the things that I do then all the things seems that I've lived it
Grateful for the [?]
Cause it provides us with a distraction from what this life does
Even though [?] is still a place I hate to go
But as long as the ceiling's leaking I'll be needing to, so I'll forego, yo
Until the day I retire and buy my slippers
Me and the missus are doing gardening or washing dishes
Getting pissed, just whiffs on the sly
Cause life's a bugger then you die

[Hook]
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why I write rhymes
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why we aim high
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why I write rhymes
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
We fight to survive

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
I woke up early on my birthday
Hungover in the worst way
I'm 28, that means I've outlived Kurt Cobain
My physical frame's in pain because I'm lazy
No motivation with the aspiration of Jay Z
Most days I'm slacking off, jacking off
If there's a project I'm working on I'll probably slack it off
Some days I'd like to shoot to fame, exercise and lose some weight
Other times I want to goof and play computer games
Weekends and weekdays don't mean a thing to me
I'm the hardest-working slacker in the industry
Wake up when it's bedtime and doze when the sun shines
I even have a shower and a change of clothes sometimes
Boot up my PC, loop up a beat
And keep repeating it till we complete the piece, easy peasy
No stress, I had to bed and catch some Zs
And then repeat the process till I've amassed a stack of Ps
Never had to sell drugs or be a violent mugger
But believe me, I've seen how life's a bugger
Before it pulls you down, it lifts you so high
It's a real bloody bugger, then you die

[Hook]
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why I write rhymes
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why we aim high
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
That's why I write rhymes
Cos you never know when you're gonna go
Life's a bugger, then you die
We fight to survive
