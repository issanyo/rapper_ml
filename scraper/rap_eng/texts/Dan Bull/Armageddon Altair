[Verse 1]
We travel back in time
Back to that divine land
Enshrined in annals
Where the faction of Assassins rise
The ballads tell a tale of a man
Who has defined the ages
With the way that he slays and raps in rapid rhymes
I'll take that brainwave back
From digital age to eight track
Face facts
These ace raps
Hit like straight backs hit haystacks
So you may say I'm laid back
I'll claim that
But my aim's making every place mapped
While I chase fame and take payback
Who says today's doomsday?
Crusades are a new age
You may lose faith
Soon as I swoop waving two blades
When an eagle soars
Lethal claws
Cease all thoughts
Of the people caught
I've seen the way that evil talks
They lead the way and the sheep'll walk

[Hook]
I am part of the Brotherhood
Finding the Ark of the Covenant
Take pride in my art and I'm loving it
Fighting the guards
With a couple of knives in the dark
Under cover of night
As I hide from the light
And then strike in the heart of the government
The provider of suffering
Buffering
Buffering
Leave no time for recovering

I am part of the Brotherhood
Finding the Ark of the Covenant
Take pride in my art and I'm loving it
Fighting the guards
With a couple of knives in the dark
Under cover of night
As I hide from the light
And then strike in the heart of the government
The provider of suffering
Buffering
Buffering
Leave no time for recovering

[Verse 2]
Red hidden blade
Dead giveaway
Neck split in twain
That didn't change
The nectar of the Apple of Eden's forever forbidden taste
I'm an avenger
On an adventure
Honour's essential
Follow my mentor
Though I'm not looking for scuffles
I'm going to be getting in one with the Templars
Every era's under an empire
That's under impression that they'll ascend higher
Than their ascendants they're effectively lent by
A memory sent via genetically linked wires to the future
Accessed through hacking hereditary cues through a computer
Animus rendering surroundings
As I just blend in with the crowd
I'm going to pretend my hood's a cowl
And then get out of town
Without a sound
So stealthy now
I prowl around the realm
Until I'm out of bounds
Grabbing a flag
That I'll add to the bag
Full of everything else I found

[Hook]
I am part of the Brotherhood
Finding the Ark of the Covenant
Take pride in my art and I'm loving it
Fighting the guards
With a couple of knives in the dark
Under cover of night
As I hide from the light
And then strike in the heart of the government
The provider of suffering
Buffering
Buffering
Leave no time for recovering

[Outro]
Armageddon Altaïr?
I'm a getting out of here
Armageddon Altaïr?
I'm a getting out of here
