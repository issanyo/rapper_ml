[Verse 1]
Computer games are getting too easy these days (WHY!)
For each mistake we just reload and resave
In the meek way that they were never meant to be played
We need to cease placing emphasis on seagate
Be brave, and implement a higher plan
Of gaming and never saving, the name is Iron Man

[Hook]
I want an adrenaline overload
Iron Man Mode (X2)
Never save gameplay, never reload
Iron Man Mode (X2)

[Verse 2]
If there is no risk, then there's no reward
Slaves to the save, throw your overlords overboard
Computer mutiny through the screens new to me
Dan and a cannon canning anyone that shoots at me
Napoleonic flows, Bonaparte, leaving loads of foes blown apart
No comeback, Kenobi Obi-Wan
For one life only Lonely Heart
No reloading, you can only restart
This is Iron Man Mode and I am Tony Stark (HA)

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You'll realize real life is irreplaceable
No three strikes, this isn't baseball
Your bones are breakable, your foes'll break them all
They'll take the opportunity by any means available
To demonstrate that your remains are quite biodegradable
If you're incapable to comprehend mortality
I advocate the remedy of permanent fatality

[Hook]
