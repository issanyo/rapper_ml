[Verse 1]

The Empire’s got a new boss
Delilah Copperspoon
What a loon
Not human, too posh
Her city’s a machine and I’m a loose cog
I’m popping out the wall like a cuckoo clock
To move across rooftops in two hops
I’m mute but if I need to I’ll blow the roof off
And kudos to you lot to do what you’ve got to do
To follow through and shoot a true shot
When a bolt from the blue shocks you
I’m going to watch to determine who’s true and who’s not
The world’s bursting with vermin and parasites
Who surface disturbing this permanent paradise
Cannibalising itself then
Metabolising the toxins
And we’re shocked when it’s paralysed
I know violence is glamorised
So I have analysed and agonized
On every dying man I’ve sliced

[Hook]

Take back what’s yours
Walk through floors walls and locked doors
Take back what’s yours
‘Til warm water pours from all your pores
Take back what’s yours
All aboard, pull the oars, ‘til we storm all your shores
Take back what’s yours
‘Til your foes crawl gory floors on all fours

[Verse 2]

There’s smoke and dust choking us
I hope it won’t combust
It’s coating the mechanism of oppression's spokes with rust
There’s only so much that we’ll let our load be pushed
To the overseers who oversee us I show disgust
How come they get the loaf while we beg below for crusts?
I don’t trust them just as far as I could throw the fucks
And when stones are chucked
Bones are bust, wounds are opened up
Resistance and revolt’s a must
We’re going for broke or bust
Fed up of hanging round shanty towns in hand-me-downs
I’m tracking down your family
If you don’t hand me the crown
Today’s the day that I will finally find
The fire inside to come and claim what’s rightfully mine I’m
Tripping the kingdom and crying for
Children, men and women to rise
Your tyranny’s rivers are dry, my, this is a riveting sight
In the blink of an eye you’re gonna die
So think of your imminent plight
Give it a try, I decline to
Give up the fight 'til the end of my life

[Hook]

Take back what’s yours
Walk through floors walls and locked doors
Take back what’s yours
‘Til warm water pours from all your pores
Take back what’s yours
All aboard, pull the oars, ‘til we storm all your shores
Take back what’s yours
‘Til your foes crawl gory floors on all fours

[Verse 3]

I’m going in
I’m of the inclination to
Instigate an insubordination
This is an incantation
An invocation, invitation
To an investigation
I’ll infiltrate, interpret
And inseminate insider information
Incite intimidation in interrogation
To get an indication of the indignatious indoctrination
Inundated in her nation
Of integration, immigration, indiscrimination
Interrelation and inflammation in inhabitation
Under industrialisation
Innocuous inoculation against an infestation
Insinuation? Incrimination
Implication? Incarceration
It’s an illustration of the inculcated inconsideration
Incubated in us since her installation
The inauguration initiated intensification
Of inebriation imitating inspiration
Intoxication, impersonates invigoration
Instrumental in inhibiting imagination
Innovation replaced with irritation
Infatuation with infuriation
Illumination with immolation
Incineration and inhalation of the vapour’s incapacitation
I’m impudent indemnification’s insolent incarnation
Your argument just is invalidation

[Hook]

Take back what’s yours
Walk through floors walls and locked doors
Take back what’s yours
‘Til warm water pours from all your pores
Take back what’s yours
All aboard, pull the oars, ‘til we storm all your shores
Take back what’s yours
‘Til your foes crawl gory floors on all fours
