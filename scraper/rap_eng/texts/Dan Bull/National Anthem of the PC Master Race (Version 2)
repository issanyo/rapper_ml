[Verse 1]
Just master race things
Just master race things
Just master race things
You know just master race things
Oi Mate! Check out my new rig! Nine thousand and two gig
Of games with more mods than a who gig
I read the jealousy written on your face
When I said I needed planning permission for my case
Your rig is a disgrace, it's a little but a raised
Middle finger up to Gaben and an insult to the race
Every console falls prey to the same fate
Blatant aliasing and a lame frame rate
Hey mate
I measure mine in Planck time
Beat you to the singularity defining mankind
Ahead of the times, you wouldn't even believe
I pre-order a release before it's even conceived
I've got such a cutting edge chipset
That I can only play games that don't even exist yet

[Chorus]
You console peasants have facts to face
Facts to face
Have facts to face
You can't compare to dat master race
The master race will FAQ your face

[Verse 2]
I'm just letting you know there's no letters as sexy (uh)
As WASD (ooh)
I've got an 8TB SSD (mmh)
You've got an IDE running XP (eugh!)
Forget 1080p, that's a baby screen (mama)
Anything less than 8K will make me scream (ahh!)
If there's ever a pixel that I can plainly see
It best be on a retro indie game release

Fight 1:
Go!

Get a better Nvidia, you fricking idiot
Your laggy jaggies are actually hideous
I want the smoothest skins, Nivea
For my Skyrim mod to get jiggy with Lydia
While we're waving digital dicks about
I've got more monitors than your pixel count
My Oculus Rift wears an Oculus Rift
With an Oculus Rift on its Oculus Rift
And I don't even use them
I've got an IMAX eye implant
Man I think I'm gonna climax
Here's a nice fact for you to wank about
There's more cash in my steam wallet than in my bank account
Kids stay in school, never break rules
And make sure you pray every day to Gabe Newell
(Amen, brother)

[Chorus]
You console peasants have facts to face
Facts to face
Have facts to face
You can't compare to that master race
The master race will FAQ your face

[Verse 3]
Just master race things
Just master race things
Just master race things
You know just master race things
Just master race things
Just master race things
Just master race things
You know just master race things (rah)

(Boom!)
I'm pro-nuclear power
'Cause I can drain a whole power plant with my PSU in an hour
The Hoover Dam's water cooling my tower
My CPU needs something new to devour
While you fool around with your Mountain Dew
My watercooler's the fountain of youth
I don't give a damn about the review
My PC's a beast, it should be held in a zoo
You're a console peasant, I'm a grumpy old pedant
In an adolescent brain on the credit of my parents
I had them pay for my setup as a present
'Cause I said I needed better processing for my lessons
What I meant was FPS in League of Legends
And the set of LED keys on my desk are iridescent
Do I ever have a little bit of empathy? NO!
May our framerates be high and our temperatures low!

[Chorus]
You console peasants have facts to face
Facts to face
Have facts to face
You can't compare to that master race
The master race will FAQ your face
