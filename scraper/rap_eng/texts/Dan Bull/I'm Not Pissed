[Intro]
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
[? 0:05]

[Verse 1]
In my belly, there was nothing
So empty, I really needed a drink
Then you came in, with some tights on
And a skirt so short, I could see your minge
And you said: "Come to the
Pub with me, please
Let us binge
Thoroughly"

[Chorus]
I'm not pissed
I can drink you under the table
I'm not pissed
I've smashed off my faiths
On your knees
In a [? 0:48] you see
I'm not pissed
Let me finish this glass, and we can get some shits

Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
[? 1:02]
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
Amaretto, retto, retto
[? 1:09]

[Verse 2]
When I'm walking at an angle
I'm not tipsy, I just love to lean
Laying down now, time for sleeping
But before that, where are my khakis?
I'm sure I [? them in? 1:24]
The club with me, jeez
Everything's fuzzy
But

[Chorus]
I'm not pissed
I can drive perfectly safe, look
I'm not pissed
Noone's on the road this late
On your knees, [? 1:51]
I'm not pissed
Now be a good lass and kiss my dick
