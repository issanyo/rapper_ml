[Hook]
We only want you to be happy
We only want you to be happy
And if you refuse
We won't be held accountable
For what
We do to you
Take your joy

[Verse 1]
Well well welcome to Wellington Wells
A tranquil town
Nestled gently in the fens and the fells
Folk flocked from afar
They were fairly compelled
By a desire to repel
Negative memories' spells
But nothing ever even happened
Did it?
So let me dispel
The tittle tattle
It'll baffle
Leave you empty a shell
Clearly unwell
But we've the medicine
To better your health
There's nothing quite like a rest
To replenish the cells
In the home of debonair gentlemen
And delicate belles
Women are feminine, svelte
Donning an elegant blouse
While the men are in trousers
Of sumerian felt
Under double breasted blazers
With the trendy lapels
But if you break the legislation
You'll be readily dealt
There's nothing quite like arrest
To replenish the cells
So don't expect to be held
In a respectable house
Without respecting the house rules
In which we excel
So any petulant whelk
I detect collecting intel
Upon this excellent realm
Will get his rectum impaled
As a correction, expelled
And in the distance the yells
Will be dismissed as a mouse
Squeaking by everyone else

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Oi
Take your place
With the wellies
And the wastrels
Lace your crepes
With a bellyful
Of brain fuel
Brain fooled
Hey
You could barely call it tasteful
Buddy
But he bloody better be grateful
And take another plateful
Straight from the table
Today we're serving up betrayal
By the ladle
What do you need to pray for?
You're already faithful
All your mistakes
Have been already paid for
Any deviation from the state
Will be painful
That's just not cricket
Baseball
Make sure
If you see a welly acting at all strange
Call us so we can lay laws
Never mind
If I barely can sing
Blame that on the very bad
Thing
Moving swiftly forward
Awesome
To the portion
Talking to law enforcement
This is Jimmy
British bobby
Hitting civvies
Is his hobby
But you've got nothing to fear
If you adhere to the rules
That are utterly clear
Dress to impress
Be nice and polite
Take your joy
Stay inside in the night
And the bobby on the beat
Won't have to beat you
Save that for the happy few

[Hook 2]
We only want you to be happy
We only want you to be happy
And if you refuse
We won't be held accountable
For what
We do to you
Take your joy
Take your joy
Enjoy your joy
Take your joy
It's the safest choice

[Verse 3]
An attack of anxiety
As I hang by a
T-H-R-E-A-D
To sobriety
Why oh why
Are we pushed to the margin
By high society
Shoved in the garden
Shuffling past
Muttering crap
As we fight to survive
On nothing but scraps
Look and understand
I'm an upstanding chap
Nothing underhand
I just want something back
From the upper class
That have got the upper hand
On the downers
It's upside down
Front to back
But on the upside
Downers are up
To get down
And they're down
To get up
Take a ticket to town
Dig it?
Digging around
To get in and out
Quicker than I will have
When I've figured it out
Wow
Eureka
We reek of
Fap
Pee
Poo
Phew
But at least we're the happy few

[Verse 4]
There's no better place to live in
No better living
Than the land
Where happiness is a given
Why trouble your mind
With decisions
Free will is the benignest of prisons
Take joy
See the light through the prism
Close your eyes
And vibe to the rhythm
Listen
That is the sound of serenity
Arisen
Sapping downers of energy
Give them
A smack around for their benefit
A bit of rough and tumble
Is the healthiest sedative
Well at least it it now
'Cause I said it is
And any doubt
Is a mouthful of heresies
Don't like drugs
Any you're doubtful of therapy?
There's very little help
For you now
So the remedy
For downers
Inherently
Renowned to be menaces
Is a swift kick in the head
Oh, yes it is
