[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm Vito Scaletta
When it comes to being a G there's no one better
I'm a vet straight fresh out of Operation Husky
Put my life on the line but the state doesn't trust me
I came out of Italy, specifically Sicily
'Til I shipped in with the immigrants to the Big City
Live gritty!
Had a hard start but still we party hard and sing ditties
Living large, drinking with them broads with the big titties
But when you're living big you tend to run up debts
And clearing credit here's not a case of signing another cheque
We deal with suitcases stuffed with banknotes
And debt collectors who aren't too shy to shank throats
When there's money to pay, you better pay, prick
And if you can't make it, you better take it
Cause if you have to twist an arm, you may as well break it
Get in the fucking car, you're getting taken on a day trip

[Hook]
In a city that won't sleep
We live the American Dream
And in a city that won't sleep
We live the American Dream
If it's God that has made man
Then a made man is God (Amen!)
If it's God that has made man
Then a made man is God (Amen!)

[Verse 2]
I'm a Mafia Don, stacking the funds
Trying to hold me back, what kind of crack are you on?
I roll with a Beretta 38 and my friend Joe
But I know we're all alone in the end though
Every road leads there, no need to go dead slow
So speed up because I said so
Or be left in the red glow of the tail lights
Life's a driving test and you can't fail twice
Ain't going back to jail, you can inhale on my tail pipe
Make no mistake, I'm running the Bay
If you've something to say
I'll aim my submachine gun and then spray
A man of grand ambitions but still I'm humble and pray
Hungry to take over, never done for the day
I came reluctantly in to the Underworld
Tried to play it straight but it sucked me back in
Guess I'm not done with the girl
So I made a date with fate and aimed to take everything I could
And 'til I end up in Satan's flames
It's never been as good

[Hook]
In a city that won't sleep
We live the American Dream
And in a city that won't sleep
We live the American Dream
If it's God that has made man
Then a made man is God
If it's God that has made man
Then a made man is God
Gangster...
