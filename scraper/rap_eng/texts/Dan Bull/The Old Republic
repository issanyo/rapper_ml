[Verse 1]
Forget the Rancor, Daniel’s in the lion’s lair
I’m a starfighter, you’re flying Ryanair
I visited BioWare, dined on their chinaware
With a pipe, a pair of slippers and reclining chair
I’m aware my rare dialect’s more fluent than a protocol droid
With a rhyming flair
I’m getting quite a strain in my neck ok
‘cos I’ve got a bigger brain than a Twi’lek
Yep
I’m called Dan, I’m a Star Wars fan
Far more than you, I’m hardcore, man
From Korriban to Coruscant
Alderaan to Dromund Kaas
I drop the hottest raps
I am the top of the class
I’m a Jedi Knight, led by my skill
To kill whoever I like
I’m a murderer, you’re a nerf herder, bruh
I got ya coffin, I don’t mean tubercular
Ha!
I’m an Imperial Agent, you’re merely a vagrant
Look, Jabba the Hutt’s butt’s nearly as fragrant
I can take a track about the Old Republic
And make it so banging it becomes a club hit
I’m a bounty hunter about to plunder
The Senate for 100,000 Credits
So no doubt you wonder just how I get it
Bumping louder than the sound of thunder

[Verse 2]
You’re more annoying than a crowd of Gungans
A bloody Ewok could get you out your bunker
I’m a Sith Inquisitor
You’re nothing but a Gullipud Prannock
I’m a Planetary Governor
And I’m a smuggler, you’re ugly
Your balls haven’t dropped, you must be a juggler
Rub-a-dub, three dugs in a tub
Two of them are being buggered
So you must be the buggerer
Space hustler, straight huffing
And then puffing and then blowing
Your space station up
In a ball of flame, no ball and chain
‘cos I take no prisoners, I’m causing pain
A devout Sith, straight out the mythology
Taking out Colonies easy, you’re helpless
I easily leave each of you outlived, yeah
You should have a bad feeling about this

[Outro]
Dan Bull
I've got a massive collection of original Star Wars figures
Many in the original packaging
I've got Yakface. I've got YAKFACE
Type in 'Yakface action figure' on eBay
That's how I roll
