[Verse]
We're here (Where?) Shear
Sh-sh-sh-sh, they're near
Listen, they can detect fear
Like sizzling bacons and eggs
We're next on the breakfast menu, I thus
Am sensing some ennui, 'cause
There's a funny running through my tummy
And I really don't reckon it's appendicitis
Ready to get in a fight, thrust
And break something off like a fresh baked pie crust
Tireless when I bust spineless dinos up
With mindless violence
Look, I've got the minds touch
Each type of life that I touch is a pile of dust
You might rise up like Lazarus
But you can't Hyde, I'll find you, trust
I'm biased against a Goliath
Wiping him out like a pest or a virus
You'll never survive unless you're as clever as Caira
And you ain't, I bet you a fiver
My Trapper will track you to base
Even if it's deep as a trap track packed full of bass
I'm cracking ahead
Cracking a Kraken in the head, he's lacking the cred
Man, I'm back in your ends and attacking your nest, so you'll have to defend it
My manner and method of wrecking your plans like a Gent is actually splendid
That Chap's too cray, tell 2K
Pulling your cranium off like a toup√©e
Keeping up appearances
And insist on pronouncing bucket as bouquet

True say
Don't get involved in Evolve
If your soul isn't wholly controlled
To revolve round the goal
Ripping holes into all you behold
Keep it cold, you've been told
Said, don't get involved in Evolve
If your soul isn't wholly controlled
To revolve round the goal
Ripping holes into all you behold
Keep it cold, you've been told

[Outro]
Don't say you haven't been
Because you obviously have
