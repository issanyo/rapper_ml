[Verse 1]
A CD won't get me a mortgage
That's because you pricks haven't bought it
Five pound and you couldn't affort it?
Just cocked the download and ignored it?
I believe in [a scene? 0:28] as much
As I believe OJ Simpson was innocent
[Been a bit? 0:31] of a geek
[Hold up and now the? 0:32] whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
I'm going to the mountain, when I come back
I'll be ten times better, backpack on my back
Like I'm going [on out in? 0:38]
I'm not going [on an outing? 0:39]
I'm going to the mountain
I'm going to the mountain, when I come back
I'll be ten times better, backpack on my back
Like I'm going [on out in? 0:45]
I'm not going [on an outing? 0:46]
I'm going to the mountain

[Verse 2]
I'm going to the mountain again
'Cause I got atop, my last album impressed
The doubters again, and at this rate
It won't be out in 2010
So you can smile for a while
But know, when I'm back from the mountain
You're going to hear the sound of immense
[? 1:00] lyricist crowned as the best
For now I'm allowing the stress
Messing around, doing an impression
And sounding like Ghetts
Down on the best track to ever spin around in your decks
I'm bound to impress
With the [? 1:11] coming louder than jets
Going over your head to the mountain again
[? 1:14]

[Chorus]
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up

[Verse 3]
I ain't mastered my craft yet
But the more time in a mountain, the better the tracks get
Improvement's the key, what I do with the beats
Leave you with a completely snapped neck
I've [? 1:36] rapped, 'til I take my last breath
Whether or not I'm gettin' a fat cheque
I [vent my thoughts? 1:39] with a black pen
Record, then you all, like: "Did you hear what Dan said?"
No metaphor
That man [stressing more than? 1:45] Ghetts
And that takes some doing
I'm boiling up, the frustration brewing
And making you and your mates listen to it
It's amazing the way that I do it
I hate to ruin your fun
But you and your dumb crew aren't making a great improvement!
My CD won't get me a mortgage
That's because you pricks haven't bought it
Five pound and you couldn't affort it?
Just cocked the download and ignored it?
I believe in [a scene? 2:04] as much
As I believe OJ Simpson was innocent
[Been a bit? 2:07] of a geek
[Hold up and now the? 2:08] whole scene's looking at me, but hold up

[Chorus]
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up
Hold up, hold up
The whole scene's looking at me, but hold up

[Verse 4]
Elevation? Been there, done it
I've planted my flag at the summit
Stood astride the mountain
The tiger's grouching, now the dragon is coming
You [? 2:31] standing from nothin'
[? 2:33] is rubbish
I'm standing above at the foot of the mountain
I'm rambling up any fuckers
[? 2:37]
[? 2:39]
Look around, prick
You wanted somethin' that sounds sick, now you've found it
[? 2:44]
Ignorant listeners are gonna tell I've got it down to a [? 2:48]
Who's putting in a word
Like a sherpa [up a? 2:50] mountain, it's me
