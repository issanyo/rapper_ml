[Intro]
(Wall Street Spirit)

[Verse 1]
From all of us who couldn't be there in person
We're there in spirit through the words in this verse. Listen:
New York cops are arresting the wrong people
Peaceful protesters are not evil
But the love for money is
The bloody buggers pulled the rug from under yours
These days the actual news is
Just as funny as stuff from The Onion
The bulletins are full of things
That are full of more bull than my surname could have been
You could put 'em in a jail cell 'til they're bailed out (hah)
Bailed out
But you're only gonna fail now
Because we're staying around 'til we prevail
The crowd's not going away
They're standing their ground
'Til an answer is found
This is for everyone that's been busted
I don't wanna rhyme "banker" with "wanker"
But I just did

[Chorus]
All streets lead to Wall Street
So we all need to make them feel the force and heat
All streets lead to Wall Street
So we all need to make them feel the force and heat

[Verse 2]
Is it reckless speculation
To suggest that reckless speculation
Went and made a mess of this situation
Taking everything except for the kitchen basin
Then when you're sitting on the pavement to make this statement
The feds kick your face in
It's flagrant, it's blatant
It's amazing the way they shamelessly raped us
Statesmen are too craven
To take us away from the days of Reagan
And raise regulation to a state
Where the stakes are less dangerous
But now the alarm clock's ringing
The nation awakens and can't stop singing
Now the alarm clock's ringing
The nation awakens and can't stop singing

[Chorus]
All streets lead to Wall Street
So we all need to make them feel the force and heat
All streets lead to Wall Street
So we all need to make them feel the force and heat

[Outro]
And thanks to Lupe Fiasco for the tents
Cheers, matey
