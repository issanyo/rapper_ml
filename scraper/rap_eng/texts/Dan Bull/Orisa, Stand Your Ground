[Intro]
Orisa oh
Orisa go
(Oh)

[Chorus]
Orisa oh
Stand your ground
Now Orisa go
Pull their defences down
Orisa oh
Watch over the team
Now Orisa hold
Us together in victory

[Verse 1]
Listen to me, sir, there's a new individual feature
On the scene that's pleased to meet you
Greet Orisa
She treats you like a piece of meat
On greasy pizza
I don't mean she feeds you, she eats you
And leaves the left over pieces in the freezer
You're frozen in the spot, call it immediate anaesthesia
Controlling gravity to make you halt, stay
Throwing ammo in your face as casually as Salt Bae
A babe aged but a month that does it the old way
She holds you in place before you're fucked, call it foreplay
Practicing safe sex, she brought a protective barrier
Being beat is a disease and you're the carrier
She's a tank that leaves you anchored, you wanker
You'll need to flank her for any chance to outrank her
How long will it need for you finally to learn
Leaving you burned is her primary concern

[Chorus]
Orisa oh (wa-oh)
Stand your ground
Now Orisa go (now go)
Pull their defences down
Orisa oh (Orisa)
Watch over the team (Orisa)
Now Orisa hold (Orisa)
Us together in victory

[Verse 2]
With the gun on her waist she'll blow your blooming face off
Then drop her drum in your base, call it a drum and bass drop
M8 wot, she's got this game locked
It's too late to stop, rage quit and blame a frame rate drop
You ought to be sure not to ignore the order to halt
Or she'll pull you forward with the force of a horns of a bull
A portable fortress of awesomeness
Brought in to cause an unfortunate fall
With the force of a fork lift truck
That's falling off a waterfall and crushing all your balls to mush
So if you know what's good for you then you ought to shush
She'll take on stampedes the size of a pre-order rush
She'll impede and then stamp on each and all of us
Nothing breaches through when losers shoot her armour
Because it's amusingly futuristic as Futurama
Fortify, halt, fusion driver, supercharger
She looks rather like a bull, I wonder who's the father

[Chorus]
Orisa oh (wa-oh)
Stand your ground
Now Orisa go (now go)
Pull their defences down (da-down)
Orisa oh (Orisa)
Watch over the team (Orisa)
Now Orisa hold (Orisa)
Us together in victory

(Orisa)
