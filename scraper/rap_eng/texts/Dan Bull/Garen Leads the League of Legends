It's Garen, The Might of Demacia
The type of knight, To strike and batter you
Without batting an eyelid
In fact, I couldn't be happier
Than when defending the kingdom
From endless enemy minions, They're barely a hindrance
So bring them, They're giving me income
I am the Epitome, a Shield and Steel clashing Symphony
I stand ready to protect our land and battle the Infamy
Appearance tough, I use the Perseverance buff
To heal in the back of the Battlefield
Can you hear me clear enough?
To the field of justice
I'll cut you up like Peter Sutcliffe
You'll wet your pants, As if you've had your ruptured
I'm propping the whole team up like a Buttress when i rush cliques
I'll roughly rip you up in cooking they call it rustic
I'm a Warmonger, I Don the Warmong's and Forge onward
Full force, Til' you're Conquered, Plonker
I lead the damn charge, Ripping down your ramparts
No doubt this man's hard, The Leader of the Dauntless Vanguard
In the king's name, I bring flames without delay
Victory awaits each day i make these scoundrels pay
I hurt the vile scourge, Killing accursed villains
I'm present at your death, Your final breath
Like a nurse from Macmillan

I Lead the League of Legends
Allegiance Deep Embedded In my Regiments
As each of my Legions Reach for Excellence
I Lead the League of Legends
Allegiance Deep Embedded In my Regiments

For Demacia
We Forge Onward
