[Verse 1]
I'm not the kind of guy that you would likely see
Criticising anybody, unless I believed
That they deserve to be told I disagree
With something that they've done specifically
Now I'm alright with some types of piracy
But not the violent type you find on the high seas
Why fight your allies in times of peace
Then hide behind a pile of lies like you were trying to police?

So it's okay for you to go crazily
Overboard with excessive use of force?
Though sticks and stones may break your bones
They don't provoke a massacre with no remorse
But never mind that, don't give it another thought
'Cause provididing aid's clearly an act of war
You should do anything, no matter how debauched
To stop support from ever getting to your ports

[Chorus]
I knew a Jewish girl, and she was a pearl
What I'm trying to say is that I've got no hatred
I've got nothing on Jews, baby
(no, no, no, nothing wrong with jews)
(no, nothing wrong with jews)
This is aimed at The Jewish State, yeah
(no, no, no, nothing wrong with jews)
(no, nothing wrong with jews)

[Verse 2]
It's like I have witnessed Zionism's Rennaissance
You and your mates in the States really get along
They veto anything that doesn't let you get what you want
Even if it's sending planes to bomb Lebanon
Or a naval blockade dawn raid with every weapon drawn
Treating aid workers as agents of Hezbollah
Your reputation is tainted for evermore
Stop... have a think about it

You've attacked Lebanon, you've attacked Egypt
Even to Syria you're dealing blows
You've attacked Jordan, you've had a war with
Every bordering country I know
British Israeli relations are so low
So I hope I don't become another Shlomo
This song's never going to win a MOBO
Even though I flow like the oil to the shores of the Gulf coast
Or the blood in the waters of your coast

[Chorus]
I knew a Jewish girl, and she was a pearl
What I'm trying to say is that I've got no hatred
I've got nothing on Jews, baby
(No, no, no, nothing wrong with jews)
(no, nothing wrong with jews)
This is aimed at The Jewish State, yeah
(no, no, no, nothing wrong with jews)
(no, nothing wrong with jews)

[Outro]
To Zion, to Zion
To Zion, to Zion
To Zion, to Zion
To Zion, to Zion
