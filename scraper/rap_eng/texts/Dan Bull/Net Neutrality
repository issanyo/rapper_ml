The world wide web is under attack
They’re taking it away but we’re pulling it back
The world wide web is under attack
They’re taking it away but we’re pulling it back

[Verse 1]
So the FCC won’t let me be
They wanna stack the deck for the ISPs
But we got a couple of tricks up our sleeves
It’s far too important to leave to police
It could lead to the streets
A breach of the peace
And even decrease our freedom of speech
There’s never been a bigger reason to read up
And see what’s agreed ‘cause of greed for the green and deceit
The greener the leaf, the sweeter the tree
The quicker they’ll chop it down and leave nothing but tree stumps
Debris
The Damage is done, no refund received
See, the thing about net neutrality
Is unless you get huge salaries
The paramedic won’t rescue casualties
‘Til they've seen to the rich next dude’s allergies
They’ll prioritize cash over content
Wanna send one bit? That’s one sent
What nonsense, man it’s scaring me
A planet of plenty’s selling scarcity
Innovation paved the way
Now invaders are paying to take it away
But they ain't gonna make it today
Letting that happen’s a major mistake
If Lessig was rapping he’d tell you the same
Letting that happen’s a major mistake
Tim Berners Lee baked us a cake
And they've taken the cherry AND THE CAKE!!!
Discrimination is happening today
To blacks and to gays and to packets of data
Though ethically they’re exactly the same
So oi, we’re not gonna stand for it mate
U wot?
The fok u sayin bruv?
U wot m8???
The fok u saying bruv?
U wot?
Fak off u arsehole

[Verse 2]
I’m from the place John Oliver came from
Where no matter where you live you should be singing the same song
At long last, I’m putting Comcast on blast
‘Cause they never learned their lesson like they’re in the wrong class
Well I’m the professor and I’m setting you with one task
Get ‘em knocked back like a shot glass
Straight in front of me’s a cable company
The way they’re behaving’s unbelievable
Comcast is in league with the Devil
And it’s pissing me off, I’m not even American
Take a peek, see from the evidence
Netflix had to pay a fee to get better links
It’s a shakedown, communication breakdown
There’s a bully in the playground
I had enough of that at school, won’t lay down
Lay a finger on me: you’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
You’ll be laid out
Lay a finger on me: You’ll be laid out

The world wide web is under attack
They’re taking it away but we’re pulling it back
Taking it back, taking it back
We’re taking it, we’re taking it back
