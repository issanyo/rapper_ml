[Intro]
There is a legend round here
A killer buried, but not dead
A curse of Crystal Lake
They say, he died as a boy, but he keeps coming back
Few have seen him and lived
Some of people tried to stop him
No one can

[Verse 1: DaddyPhatSnaps]
A slasher
The best there ever was
Skull masher
I'll bash ya
My stature alone, a gulp gasper
You go faster
In hopes I won't capture
Got a slow gather
But when I go it don’t matter
You’re mine
I beat you just to hear your bones shatter
With no chatter
I'll decimate your whole chapter
Of horny little teenage individuals
They’re imbeciles
'Cus if they kept it in their pants
The soundtracks unmissable
Unpredictable
And causing inexplicable damage
Savage
I’m detaching your limbs when I ravage
Grab you out your pyjamas
Wrap you up in a hammock
Slam you like down like a hammer
'Til your brain matter splatters (ugh)

[Chorus]
I’m a big dead man in a hockey mask
I like knives but I still got an axe to grind
Because you killed my mom
I really loved my mama

[Verse 2: DaddyPhatSnaps]
Now Jason
Camp Crystal Lake’s a safe haven
Who praise playing
With their private parts
While you’re flailing around
The lake spraying
Drowning, ok then
Well mama started taking their lives as my payment
But I failed you in the end
So now it's time Jason
Make them fear the fear you that you felt
And damnation
Let mama coach you
This is what you do
When encountering other humans
You drown them and keep pursuing
'Cus mama is disapproving
Of everything that they’re doing here
Boozing instead of choosing to save you, but
Now we’re proving a point
By rearranging their joints
Into different shapes til it breaks
And deflates mistakes that they've made
These people must pay with a grave
And be slayed too late to be swayed
You're taking that knife and you flay 'em
Hang on the wall and display them
You make them pay for your mama
And how it feels to betray her
The origins of a slayer
Blood out each orifice sprayer
Beware 'cus Jason is here

[Chorus]
I’m a big dead man in a hockey mask
I like knives but I still got an axe to grind
Because you killed my mom
I really loved my mama

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
Ooops, silly me
I slipped and did a killing spree
Come on, this is thrilling
It needn’t be like drilling teeth
Just think of me like an amateur dentist
Pulling feelings free
With a little extra off the top
No fee, this one’s on me
A decent chef will clean
The meat off his machete
After cleaving arteries to pieces of spaghetti
Is that a pile of brains or Bolognese?
I don’t want to say
We’re all going on a
Summer holiday
Im betting you never imagined a vacation
Where jason’s there chasing
A rather forward form of flirtation
Heart rate racing
But not the kind of fellow to make a date with
You should maybe a call a funeral director
Make arrangements
Jason’ll aid you
To stay adjacent to nature
Getting fucked up in the woods
With one eye
I just made it blatant
If it's not a rapist in a Jason mask
I make it as
I'll be a rapper, rearranging Shady’s rap
Flashback to an 80’s past
I'll bring the pain back fast
And ill make it last
It's too late when you hear the crash
Breaking glass
I'm trespassing in your cabin
With my face in a mask
I hack, hack, hack, hack
Leave faces slashed
Mowing out of towners down
Mere blades of grass
I'm afraid you haven’t escaped
There's no way to do that
You’re just my favourite flavour
That I've saved to last

[Outro]
