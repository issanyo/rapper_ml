[Intro: Dan Bull & Anything4Views]
So much drama goin' in the LBC
It's kinda hard being Road H-O single G
It's bloody Roadhog
Ay, it's Chad and I'm really fat
It's bloody Roadhog
You know, I kind of look like Roadhog
Is this- is this why you asked me to be part of your Roadhog rap, Dan?

[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
It's bloody Roadhog
That bloke what don't knock the door
Before he blows all your clothes off
So what?
Your number's up like he's scrolling through your phone log
You're just another Joe Bloggs learning that there's no God
Twisted Jehovah's witness sticking shit through your postbox
Hopping on the chopper, rode off, you know he won't stop
For nothing but a robbery a sloppy joe or blowjob
The saggy pantsed avalanche to your snowdrop
Flows hotter than a smoke shop stove top
Big belly flopping, stopping any deadly bowshot
He's his own boss, road up to a roadblock
And told cops he's robbing them
So sorry for the hold up
Oh, fuuu...!
Rock and Roll, frog and toad
Hot and cold, lock and load
No one else gotten close, bruv
Heavy as a truck, rigged up, fingerless gloves
Knuckle dusters and a thumb ring, ready to ruck big
Going up against this bugger is a though gig
Feel the hooks dig, bleeding like a stuck pig (whee!)
Grammatic anarchist, no fucks gived
Oh no, he didn't go there
He just did!

[Anything4Views]
Now I'm gonna do the Roadhog thing again, okay you ready?

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Anything4Views]
Just when you reckon this rap's run amok
I pull a Roadhog and drag you right back with the hook
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Stopping your life story during the prologue
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Nothing but flows, no build up and no drop
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
You can go sod yourself with your own knob

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
Down and dirty, below the belt is how he fights
Gut busting, belly button is the outie type
As if his belt size isn't an unhealthy sign
Why lose weight now? Another day there'll still be time
He'll be fine
Filthy minded filthy swine
Guilty of crimes of the kill people kind
Messy pig, prime specimen
Try and get him in a bind
And you're like to find your life line lessening
Lying little swines, I've a life lesson, listen in
When life gives you lemons, make a mess of 'em!
When you're contaminated with that much radiation
You'll have to gas mask your face up to save your bacon (snort)
When people are face to face with a danger dealer
They could either make a meal of it or take a breather
Break a case of beer, chase it with a plate of quesadilla
Taste the meat, appreciate the flavour, bacon squealer (whee!)
An impatiant diva meets an Australian geezer
Then eats enough greasy stuff to create a seizure
Blazing reefers
Then blaming the red eye on hay fever

[Anything4Views]
Don't know if you're gonna use this, but it's fucking garbage
Be honest

[Dan Bull]
Yeah, I know, I didn't think that punch line was great either

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Anything4Views]
Just when you reckon this rap's run amok
I pull a Roadhog and drag you right back with the hook
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Stopping your life story during the prologue
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Nothing but flows, no build up and no drop
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
You can go sod yourself with your own knob
Just when you reckon this rap's run amok
I pull a Roadhog and drag you right back with the hook
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Stopping your life story during the prologue
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
Nothing but flows, no build up and no drop
Roadhog
It's bloody Roadhog
You can go sod yourself with your own knob

[Outro: Anything4View]
Was- was that loud enough?
I'll do those ass lines one more time
I'll try to sound more obnoxious
