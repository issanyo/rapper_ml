LARS: Still stabbin'.  Slice.  Rome.  44 BC

VERSE 1: (MC LARS)

Friends, Romans, countrymen
Lend me your ears; and I’ll speak to them
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him
Lying bloody on the steps ‘cause could we not save him
See the evil men do lives after them
Good interred in their bones so I’m asking when
The poor cried, why did Caesar weep?
And refuse the crown - how many times?  Three?
He was my friend, faithful and just
Brutus - thought you knew this, now you’re losing my trust
Romulus and Remus think they’re spinning in their graves
'cause  the noblest Roman has misbehaved
Woe to the hands that shed this blood (blood!)
Fierce civil strife - and I’ve really had enough
Et tu Brute?  Uou’d better say farewell
You’d better say your prayers, 'cause I’m sending you to hell!

CHORUS:

We got blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more

VERSE 2: (MEGA RAN)

Those that will hear me speak, take a breather
You may hate me, call me a creature
Julius, he's been a great leader
But behold, we had to sleigh Caesar!
We agreed, may cry today
But he would have brought drama and tidal waves
And if I offend you, speak right away
Would you rather live free or die a slave?
I foresee the future, wars and confusion, and us in a stupor
Make no mistake, I don't have my ruler
I just love Rome more, we can't lose her
So I need you to be patient
Not like Mark Antony, over there hatin'
My heart is breakin', too, don't be mistaken
But civilization has got to awaken

CHORUS:

We got blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more

VERSE 3:

MC LARS: Best Beware the ides of March and April too
Claudius and Brutus we are coming for you
With Caesar's ghost so thirsty for revenge
You'll be, beginning for mercy when we finally meet again

MEGA RAN: Yo, I did it not for me, but for my government
I feel like I belong up in a rubbish bin
I made a covenant, he was my brother man
I'm haunted by it, that's my punushment

MC LARS: We got zero forgiveness, your business was sickness
You killed the greatest leader, Rome ever witnessed
O, pardon me, did you see the bloody sheet?
That’s why I can’t be gentle, why I can’t be meek

MEGA RAN: And it stained my mental! I'm so regretful!
Made a deal with my devil and my soul I wrestled
I killed not thee with half so good a will
Goodbye my servant, Caesar now be still

CHORUS:

We got blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more

VERSE 3: (DAN BULL)

Ay, I'm Cassius, not quite as loyal as Lassie is
Rome's in need of a bit of liberation
Don't you see? Let me give a demonstration
Me and my men had been conspiring to violence
A while and tonight was the night that we finally
Decided the time had arrived to provide it
The Ides of March marks the demise of a tyrant
Met Caesar on the steps of the senate
About to free his neck from the liquid within it
We crowded round him and then just in a minute
We were thrusting them in him, lost in a bloodlust
Uninhibited, until he couldn't resist
And laid limp in a lump, wouldn't summon the physician
'cause he's finished, no longer in the position
To dismiss our petition, he would have lived if he'd listened

CHORUS:

We got blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more
Blood, guts, a body on the floor
Julius Caesar your reign is no more

OUTRO:

Cry "Havoc!", let slip the dogs of war
Cry "Havoc!", let slip the dogs of war
Cry "Havoc!", let slip the dogs of war
Cry "Havoc!", let slip the dogs of war
