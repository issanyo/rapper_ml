Build it up tear it down!
Rip it to pieces and flip it around!

[O.P Juan Shinobi]
You probably don't know me
I'm the no gun assassin  O.P. Juan Shinobi
With a ninja star i'll injure ya
Sprinting up the walls like a spider with a katana
Head fast to the shrine now!
Flash! Then I spy and scout!
Blast! When I drop my bomb you'll be dying out in fire
Blaow!

[Cogwheel]
I'm cogwheel, here to grind your gears
So you better have washed behind your ears
Cos i'm coming in to clean up, but instead of lotion
I'm bringing in loads and loads and loads of asplosions
Damn i'm insane!
I can openly stand in the fray
Soaking up damage
Toting the rotary canon and spray

[Nigel longshot]
Can I just say it's an honour to be here?
Through my monacle and goggles
Gosh, I can see clear
I'm Nigel Purdy Longshot
And if you've wandered in my sights
You've obviously gone and picked the wrong spot!
Shot in the belly? Not on your nellie
I specialise in headshots
Or chopping my machete
'Til your flopping like spaghetti
Your wedding shots are rather messy
Cause i'll use remnants of your noggin as confetti!

[Eliza Doolally]
OMG! look at me!
Eliza Doolally
Leet in toxicology. Got a PHD in AOE
My acid attack is massively accurate
Splashes are stacking
Racking up the kills
You slackers are still lagging!
You're lacking the ill swagger
I have on the kill cam!
Add in the fact i'm as mad as a hatter
And my appeal is apparent
Take of your skin as if i'm peeling a carrot!
A connoisseur of the miracle cure
Pour it like vintage claret

[Sgt. Stone]
I'm Sarge stone
You might know I'm large, bro
I pack a bandanna, Hand cannon and an afro
I'm a killing machine from the military!
Half human being, half barrage of artillery!
I deal damage, Full frontal assault!
'Til I reset everything you've done to default

[Tony Turretto]
Do you remember me?
I'm the engineer
That will send my enemy up into the celestial sphere
I'm Tony Turretto and when I set up a defence here
You can rest assured it'll be better than a fence
Yeah!
I'm talking bullets
Caulking turrets
Chucking rivets
I brought the Brooklyn spirit
And i'm fricking awesome with it!
