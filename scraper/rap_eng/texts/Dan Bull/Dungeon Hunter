[Verse 1]
It is a time without any hope
Of murder and intrigue, dagger and cloak
Savages roam through magic and smoke
And various other high fantasy tropes
There's a hero's job to be filled
Send your CV along to the guild
Perks include tons worth of loot
But the drawbacks are you'll probably be killed
No respite
From the death knight
He won't stop, even at red lights
When it's way past his bedtime
He'll keep at it til he meets that deadline
The one where your death is a headline
He's a wrecker of men's minds
Dissolve their soul like an enzyme
Please
Prevent him from bringing the end times

[Chorus]
Jump in (jump in)
To the dungeon (the dungeon)
Hunting (hunting)
For something (something) undead (undead)
Fighting (fighting)
Surviving (surviving)
Striking terror in the hearts of my foes
Til they die then I take what I find to my liking

[Verse 2]
I'm an isometric adventurer
Raising your telephone's processor temperature
Trekking the breadth and the length of Valenthia
I'm not hiking for fun, I was sent here
Raving, waving death incarnate
Draped and garbed in a justicar arcplate
Partake in the chase for pay
Til I make more change than a busty barmaid
Look at my loot and all my skills
You're not allowed to join my guild
Me and my pals were all quite thrilled
When we saw you were just another fool I'd killed
Hacking and slashing, you couldn't kill faster
That's why it's me and not you that's guildmaster
You're as easy to hack as the password "password"
You daft bastard

[Chorus]

Jump in (jump in)
To the dungeon (the dungeon)
Hunting (hunting)
For something (something) undead (undead)
Fighting (fighting)
Surviving (surviving)
Striking terror in the hearts of my foes
Til they die then I take what I find to my liking

[Verse 3]
You plebs are living in fear
I'm living for legendary gear
Can't wait for the set to appear
I'm a trifle obsessed, is it weird?
I'm a little bit OCD
No PC games, no TV
No distractions, no interruptions
Nobody better be phoning me
I'm in the zone, elite
And knowing me
I supposedly stole your seat
So go and tell your homies please
That I rode this beat
Like a noble steed
Throwing blows at your nose til your noses bleed
I've got rows of runestones for teeth
Saving the place from a plague
And then making sure I'm going home for tea

[Chorus]
Jump in (jump in)
To the dungeon (the dungeon)
Hunting (hunting)
For something (something) undead (undead)
Fighting (fighting)
Surviving (surviving)
Striking terror in the hearts of my foes
Til they die then I take what I find to my liking
