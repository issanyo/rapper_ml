[Verse 1]
It's been ages since I made a tune this raw
But it's time to draw a line in the music hall
I'm fed up of what's not got in the news reports
Daily slayings, flayings, what do they do this for?
Planes drop bombs on those with no food or water
Ha, even Sun Tzu never knew such war

But we need to change a Twitter status to a physical thing
Quit the wishful thinking, sitting like an invalid
And stop being a clicktivist, get up and light the tindersticks
Don't just sit through Shoah, Night and Fog and Schindler's List
Things are happening this minute while you reminisce
Ring your politicians, make them say they'll follow wishes
And if they break their promise take away their office quick, they're
