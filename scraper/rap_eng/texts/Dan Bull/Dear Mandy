[Intro]
Dear Peter Mandelson

[Verse 1]
I've been following your recent policy proposals
So now they've gone through, I thought I'd contribute some vocals
The focal point of my criticism's
The ridiculous decision to bring in a system where you flick a switch and
Disconnect the internet when it's suspected
That intellectual infringement has been detected
Even if the relatives they live with definitely didn't
I think it's in your best interest to bin this, yes?
'Cause isn't it a respected institution
That we're considered innocent unless different is proven?
Er, excuse me - how can you excuse exclusion
When you've not pursued a definite conclusion?
You're picking on the little man, the Lilliputian;
Now there's a pain in my gulliver and it's confusing
You're swift to treat your citizens with such little human humour
It's no wonder that we're disilliusioned

This resolution's gonna end in revolution
Just like any other governance that doesn't accept evolution
To be perfectly honest, m'lord, there'd be less intrusion
If you curtly abolished the law and left us to it
And why do games require safety ratings
But any age can see adult-aimed plays and paintings?
It's state censorship, the same as Beijing;
But even China thinks a pirate isn't worth the time of day for chasing
I think Chairman Mao would say the same thing
Since you became secretary, it's like the state's your plaything
You made a massive sacrifice, invaded loads of privacy
But if I wanted to download, there'd be no hope of finding me
I could take my mobile phone to the local library
And utilise the free wireless to find the file I need
Then what are you going to try - to disconnect their ISP?
You might as well just burn the books on rights to speech

[Chorus]
Dear Mandy
Stay away from my family
Yours considerably angrily
Dan Bull
Dear Mandy
Stay away from my family
Yours considerably angrily
Dan Bull

[Verse 2]
Who'll profit from the Digital Economy Bill?
Not the public, but the profiteers probably will
Who'll profit from the Digital Economy Bill?
Not the public, but the puppeteers probably will
I've talked about how intellectual property kills
And you're still just concerned with who's copping the bill
It's quite obvious you've been lobbied
Until the copy holders got control, and you're probably their shill
It's not your problem when you're positioned on top of the hill
In your property that probably cost a couple of mil
But wake up and smell the coffee, the milk is going off
And you're not bothered 'cause your coffers are filled

Lord, it's time you took an honesty pill
And acknowledged the majority aren't horribly thrilled
So what if I watched a torrented comedy film?
I don't need to now my country's just become a Brazil
You know the truth, Orwell spoke his views
Your House broke the news and all Hell's broken loose
The utopia we hoped for is overdue
So could you help out a little bit and don't be stupid?
The onus is on you to show us
You aren't using your throne in a way the voters don't approve
I know you're very close to David Geffen
So maybe his interests have given you a hazed perception
Hey, do you reckon you'd win today's election
Considering you're chasing this amidst a great recession?
Deception's the politician's favourite weapon
But we're already jaded from one too many painful lessons

[Chorus]
Dear Mandy
Stay away from my family
Yours considerably angrily
Dan Bull
Dear Mandy
Stay away from my family
Yours considerably angrily
Dan Bull

(I love you, Mandy)
