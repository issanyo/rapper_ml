[Intro]
Hitch

[Verse]
Does religion bring savagery or humanity?
He made a canny case, whatever your mentality
Not a fan of Islam or Christianity
He favoured Thomas Paine and Galileo Galilei
A beacon, a bastion of sanity
Rare these days, in the age where we have to be careful
What we say, for fear of profanity tearing
The veneer of inanity we passively wear (yeah)

He gave prophets of sophistry a panicky air
And that's blasphemy, it has to be, how could he dare?
He weaved a very literary tapestry
Airing his opinion in the New Statesman, Vanity Fair (yeah)
But now he's left the land of malady
Where his health deteriorated rapidly
Prayer from the faithful, failed to do jack
As his hair fell away the same way his foes' fallacy fared

See, he proffered a reality
Where illogicality and God's irrationality
Barely needed to be scrutinised as anything but stupid lies
And he managed it with valor, wit and gallantry, generally, though
Not a man for geniality, evidently
And though he's dead, his immortality's there
In every interview and article, he left behind a particle
Of the soul he never believed he had, and that's remarkable

[Chorus]
Hitch, uh, uh
Atheism
Haha
Uh, uh
Johnnie Walker Black
Heey, heey
God Is Not Great
Hah, yeah
Boo la la la
You're getting Hitch-slapped
Hitch
