MAHH
This is a song that's self referential
By Dan Bull about a fellow called Deadpool
Both dead cool, both mental
Both use terms that are frowned on in general
We're giving you a heart attack
The proper medical term for that is "cardiac"
We put in 200%
You're probably only doing about half of that
Who's this beautiful dude doing martial arts?
Hey, where's Ms. Marvel at?
I'm the marvelous marvel of marvel you marvel at
Throwing marbles at marmosets
Wearing a tight black and red pajama set
Nomming marmalade because I'm Marvin, mate
And now I've got to dash because I'm rather late
For the hook in which I lazily chant my name

[Hook]
Dead to the Pool to the Pool to the Dead
If it doesn't make sense, well it's all in your head
Pool to the Dead to to Dead to the Pool
Ooh, bikinis, head to the pool
Dead to the Pool to the Pool to the Dead
If it doesn't make sense, well it's all in your head
Impressed mildly be you'll
Backwards this read
Bro, story cool

[Verse 2]
So scratch that Deadpool itch
Livestream it all on Twitch
Self referential kitsch
Auto-tuned to perfect pitch
Call women ho and bitch
Then repeat until you're rich
It's pronounced "niche" not "nich"
Oh no, YouTube just glitched
There's too much anger
Give me a chimichanga
I'm a chubby wanker
I can't read the signs well enough to see the danger
Oh, hang on, cheeky banter
And I'm fidgety, rowdy, skittish
Inexplicably sounding British
Round up critics that downvote this
And skip their life story to the finish
With so many fates to save the world from
Who will step to the plate?
Wade will, son
I make you disappear from the net like your name was...
I was running out of rhymes for Wilson
Even though I just had the opportunity to change it
I still said Wilson
And now I've done it again, we should probably bring the fills in

[Hook]
Dead to the Pool to the Pool to the Dead
If it doesn't make sense, well it's all in your head
Pool to the Dead to to Dead to the Pool
Ooh, bikinis, head to the pool
Dead to the Pool to the Pool to the Dead
If it doesn't make sense, well it's all in your head
Impressed mildly be you'll
Backwards this read
Bro, story cool

[Outro]
This song is for sale
You have money
Go on
Treat Yourself
Have you noticed how many of Dan Bull's songs end really suddenly on the final word?
