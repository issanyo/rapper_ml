[Intro]
(slapping on thighs)

[Verse]
My thighs hurt
I will stop slapping them now
I need to find another part of my body to, to slap
In order to continue the momentum of the song
How about
How about my, my, my booty?
How about I turn around and slap my booty?

(slapping)

Ooh, it's so much more percussive!
