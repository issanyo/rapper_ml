[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]
Ever since I rang the bells
And lit the flame
Nothing else will break the spell
They just don't feel the same

[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
Didn't even enjoy it, but I lived it
It's clear Hidetaka Miyazaki's gifted
By refusing to spoon feed the lore it's obscured
From your view through illusory walls
It's all up to you to explore
Doors you'll find in the mist run them through with a sword
While you're existing in two different forms
Neither of which is a human at all
Dark Souls is the ruin of all other games
Now I can't even enjoy them when I play
They're not the same as before; they have changed
But I know they ain't, so it's gotta be my brain
Dark Souls have done something to me
Taught me endurance and longevity
It's a game version of "Iron and the Soul"
It's Henry Rollins trying to uphold
This fragile body in a hostile realm
So no, I am not taking off my helm
Don't wanna lose my head, and so I use my head
Until instead of me, it's you that's dead

[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]
Ever since I rang the bells
And lit the flame
Nothing else will break the spell
They just don't feel the same

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
I'm getting high as a kite from the spider bites
While everyone in the asylum is dying of fright
So maybe I'll stay here at the Firelink Shrine
'Cause every other place is full of violent crime
Without titanite I might die tonight
Bile spread across the tiles like Vitalite
Go right down to the bowels of Blighttown
No light down there, well good for night owls
Fly now, landing down in Anor Londo
Haven't gone Hollow for yonks though
Get Gwyndolin, stick him in the bin
Not even injuring my little finger in the process
Don't you think I'm looking dope dressed in the Symbol of Avarice
Damn it's giving me a slow death
The act of dying's a hard act to follow
Lose my humanity; I'm back to Hollow
But it doesn't matter; we'll come back tomorrow
Encouraging a golem to run back to mama
In the light she'll be like, "Praise the Son!"
See what I did there? Made a pun

[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]
Ever since I rang the bells
And lit the flame
Nothing else will break the spell
They just don't feel the same

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
Swinging a drake sword into a Gravelord
Until he falls like a kid on a skateboard
It isn't as straightforward as giving him pain
Causing misery ain't all this business takes
Your role's to be cunning, while rolling and running
Controlling your thumb like you're holding a bomb and defusing it
If you got a weapon then I hope you're using it
Till we know whether you're a genius or a lunatic
So why you measuring your penis with a ruler if
It's only seven millimetres? Jesus, these demons hit hard
But me I'm releasing sick bars in a ceaseless discharge
I didn't want to tell you the cold hard truth
But I can't keep a secret this large
You died, you died, you died, you died, you died
Keep practising and you'll be good in time
Even if you have to stick down a Summon Sign
Asking for help? Man, I wish a prick would
Because all would tell them is to get good

[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]
Ever since I rang the bells
And lit the flame
Nothing else will break the spell
They just don't feel the same

[Verse 4: Dan Bull]
I'm just chilling in the catacombs and I'm back in vogue
I'm a maiden, a dame: Fashion Souls
They're invading my game, then I'm bashing trolls
Evading the pain with some barrel rolls
Yeah! Rolling, rolling, rolling
Killing everything that's got a soul in
Sticking a pole in Gwyndolin's colon
Where the Dark Sun don't shine (Ha!)
Leave him with a really raw hide in in the rear
Mad as if he caught me riding Gwynevere
There's never really anything as real as the first game
You'll remember when you're entering the Kiln of the First Flame
Face Lord Gwyn and then end the ages
Put pen to pages and amend some changes
Saying, "Sorry, fellas, there's some heavy lay-offs
We're getting rid of the Bed of Chaos"
Give a painful hit to the Grey Wolf Sif
Feed him chocolate, give a Gravelord shit
Came across a bonfire, and I gotta light it
Ayy, this bonfire's lit

[Chorus: Miracle of Sound]
Ever since I rang the bells
And lit the flame
Nothing else will break the spell
They just don't feel the same
