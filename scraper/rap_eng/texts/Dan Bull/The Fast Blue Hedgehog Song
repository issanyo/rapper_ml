Ah ah ah!
Put on my red shoes and fasten up the buckles
Flex and stretch my legs, Oh so supple

Call Amy, Tails and Knuckles
We`re ready for a scuffle
And feathers`ll be ruffled

Amy rose is a lady that knows
How to handle a hammer
Shes aiming the blows
There ain`t no evading the throws
With one little tap she`s breaking your nose

Tails sails through the air like a gale
With chaos trying to take him down to no avail
He`ll scale hills and vales
Valleys and mountains `til we prevail

Knuckles
Is a though old echidna
How he got so big`s an enigma
As a unit they`re lifting the stigma
That woodland creatures have little charisma

Spikes on my back strike and attack
Any lyre, boa, mamba, python or asp
Whiche type of life`s even faster than light?
You`re frightened to ask, it is I

I`m the supersonic sonic im on it
Like a comet at velocities that makes you want vomit
Breaking your sound barrier like a gromet
Would they ever stop me?
Far from it

Im running to the summit
I`m honest, that`s a promise
On every gold ring that i`ve got within my wallet

Bling!
Got to get those rings
Spread those wings
And wreck those things
Disinfect those stings
I`m a retro link to the future
Electro swing

Being blue, sir
Is the next big thing
There`s a spring in my step so let`s go
Thrilling

There`s a pillock called lyric and he`s going to get it
He`ll feel the force of everything were going to give him
The biggest of his wishes is to kick us off the rythm

But were never going to give in
Never going to let him
He`s never going to get anything that he threatened
Whatever the weapon
We`re old school so we`re prepping a lesson
He`ll learn that we`re never subject to agression

We`re the woodland creatures
With grand features
That`ll make you scream for the bleachers

Bringing heat like a fever
With elite beats that`ll give your speakers seizures
Dbs exeeding the reading of the meters
`til you`re pleading for a breather

*ihm, ihm*

While we just beat snake egg enemies to the etheeeeeeeeer

Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow, Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Screw Usain Bolt
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Ow, Ow!
I'm a blue flame bolt
Screw Usain Bolt
I'm a blue flame bolt
I'm a
I'm a
I'm a blue flame bolt

And a Hedgehog
