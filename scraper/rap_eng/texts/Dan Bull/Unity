[Verse 1]
An eagle soars as the streets all crawl
With people, stores and debris on the floor
We sweep up in awe at the cathedral walls
This city's laws are in need of rehaul
Freedom calls
Soldiers amassing and stacking their ammunition deep in the courts
Stand in a rank v. tattered banners and flags enacting a massacre
The assassins see this and leap from the walls unsure what the August Decrees did at all
Are you sure the Bastille couldn't fall?
We should rally morale and proceed with the war
Locks are chopped
The drawbridge drops
The raucus flock 'til they're reaching the courts ignoring the shots meat for the slaughter bleed on the floor just reeking of gore
Thanks a lot to the sans-culottes for yanking off the breeches they wore
Breaching the walls and windows leap to the floor and then smokescreen it before defeating the bourgeoisie with a claw
I'm sure we've seen this before
Better catch and dispatch him or that matchstick'll blast this bastion to ashes
That sort of action's a burning mistake
Chat to my back cause I'm turning away
The earliest grave is the turn of your fate courtesy of the dear Third Estate

[Verse 2]
The blade of the guillotine drops
I look at my watch then put it in my pocket and hurry, I've got to run in and stop my unlucky target succumbing to harm and crumbling under the chopping block while onlookers watch in numbness and shock
Back to the backstreets and the cobble
No palace these chaps dream of a hovel
Run around the action
Gunpowder blasting
Push past the crowds and leap up a shop wall
Two hops and I'm on the rooftop
Move to a new spot and then I'll soon drop
Assess the scene eagle-eyed who needs to bleed who needs to die you need to read between the lines and move the bleating sheep aside
This is the reason why
I made the decision to leave Versailles
Grim Reaper, unsheathe my scythe then cleave and leave deprived of the need to breathe or even be alive, at least
You see, I need to find Elise cause she gives me a reason to be a lease on life as we unite
