[Intro]
Dear Alan Johnson

[Verse 1]
We're against the extradition of Gary McKinnon
Not letting it happen to him
He's a valuable Briton, a man with a gift
And we're standing around while they're banishing him?
There's the evidence, where's the terrorist?
Is America pissed 'cause he damaged their image?
It's hardly the baddest of sins, is it? Admit it

Grab a pen, hand me the petition
To stick the extradition act in the bin
I'm not having that - take a fragile man from his habitat
As a matter of fact, such a talented hacker
Should have a salary at NASA
But no salary, just a cell
I really think justice just as well'd be
Served up in Great Britain
Where McKinnon can be with his family

But apparently a British citizen
Isn't considered innocent if Uncle Sam disagrees
Well Dan disagrees
I'm demanding Gary's release
Put your hands up and be counted
'Cause we are demanding Gary's release

[Chorus]
Free, free Gary McKinnon
Free, free Gary McKinnon

[Verse 2]
Look: I see Gmail peeping at my e-mail
But I doubt they're going to see jail
If we let them take him, we've failed
The train to justice derailed
Doesn't matter if he's male or female
Disabled, Asian
We need to rail against the veiled pretense
How can we let them prevail?

Read the details - extradition
A one way system against tradition
If an American did it
He'd never be sent to prison in Britain
So if they reckon they're getting McKinnon
They better be kidding, innit
Pester your local politician
To petition to abolish it
And prevent this horrible predicament
Use common sense, not ignorance
Not submission to a hegemony:
There's the prisoner, now where's the money?
What's the difference
Has anybody got permission to wreck somebody?
Watch and listen:

So the Pentagon's
Defences weren't working as they're meant to work
They were happy as Larry
That's 'til Gary gathered they were hackable actually
And yes, he acted silly
But imagine if the act was military
He could have smashed security to pieces
Wreaking a national emergency
But he didn't, 'cause he isn't a criminal
But a fantastic Asperger's geek

[Chorus]
Free, free Gary McKinnon
Free, free Gary McKinnon
Free, free Gary McKinnon
Free, free Gary McKinnon

[Outro]
Yours sincerely
Dan Bull
