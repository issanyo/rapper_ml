{Whistling}

[Verse 1]
The night before the morning after
What life was like before the blast?
I'm sure I couldn't recall or tell you now
What good's a fallen past?
Life inside these walls is all I have
And all I seem to know
But we need fresh water flowing
For the seed to grow
I've been in this vault for twenty years
And witnessed the fall of as many peers
But there aren't any enemies here
Except the lack of fresh frontiers
And since the bomb hit
I've been sitting in
Living in this little hovel
As a model citizen
With everything
To keep me alive
But not to keep me living life
Sick of being inside
I'd give my TV to see the other side
There's a new world to behold
So open an ice old Nuka-cola
Stroll on through the smouldering ruins
Wiser now you're clued up, older
Life will knock you to the floor
The rifle stock will bruise your shoulder
But beauty still finds refuge
In the eye of the beholder
We're the sole hope
To keep our people's home from defeat
With our control vault complete
We hit CTRL ALT DELETE
Reset the whole of humanity's travels
Unravel the rope that is holding us back
'Cause now that the commies and anarchists
Aren't in the plan
We can finally follow the path
Come up from below deck
Of the vault-tec ship
It's all wrecked
And behold breadth never told
Trek through a whole sector
Of old America
Feel old yet?
You will when you feel the cold breath
On your bald flesh
On your cold neck
In a cold sweat
Feel the rush there isn't any gold left
Oh heck
This wasn't in the control test
I guess it's time to settle old debts
So get ready for more heavenly hits
From me
The Soldier of 76

[Chorus]
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

Heart~
