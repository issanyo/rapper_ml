[Verse 1]
Introduction, get a ping from Hudson
With a set of specific instructions to bust in
From Alaskan backwoods, recapture Frank Woods
You'll never find a finer example of manhood
Look, capping crooks like Captain Hook I'm that good
Snapping necks like matchwood, you bastard
I've got a taste for pain as if I drank blood
I haven't seen your face in ages, have a man hug

[Hook]
Shoot at me and I'll shoot you back
The future's bleak? Nah, the future's black
I said, shoot at me and I'll shoot you back
The future's bleak? Nah, the future's black
I'm Black Opsing it, (brap) pop the clip into my pistol
Now watch this shit (2x)

[Verse 2]
I'm a Vietnam vet, the damn best
Messing with your head as if I'm Russian Roulette
And yet, I'm a respectable professional and best of all
I'm the closest that you'll ever get, to being Charlton Heston, fool
I was the best in school, exceptional
But then I left it all to get some tools
And head back to the future
Stealth action shooter
C.I.A man, Marine Captain Trooper

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
To battle Alex Mason, That'd take some adaptation
I'm the line between rivalry and annexation
Now I'm handing the plate on to David
For another generation of bullet penetration
As enemies are taken out without hesitation
For stealth infiltration or sheer devastation

[Hook]
