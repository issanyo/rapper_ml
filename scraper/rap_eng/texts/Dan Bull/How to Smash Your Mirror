[Intro]
Piano and strings
Huh, a little bit clich√©, but works well
Classic
Serious
Let's talk about something serious
This is important
Now let's do some rapping
Look

[Verse 1]
Fr-Fr-Fr-Fr-Fr-Fr
From Brother Ali to Forest Whitaker
When it comes to body image
There's a common myth that we're not bothered with it
But it's bollocks
It'd take a lot of confidence
To stop us wishing at least something was different
You see kids stacked with six packs
Skins tanned and big abs
And think that to fit in then you need to have this crap
I've had enough of airbrushed buff people I see on telly
Where's all the freckles, crooked yellow teeth and beer bellies?
I'm a bit chubby round the edges
Prefer pudding to veggies
In restaurants they say "do you want a side of salad or potato wedges?"
I'll leave you to guess my preference
*Insert generic Mr Creosote reference*
But I look after myself
Might grab an apple and leave the snacks on the shelf
As well as pizza I eat pasta as well
The human appendix is similar to my gym membership
It rarely ever gets used even when I remember it
Now I'm no exercise freak
But I exercise each week
Even if it's just stepping outside and down the street
I can swim, I can dance, I can skank or ride a bike
It doesn't matter man, variety's the spice of life

[Chorus] (x2)
Why are you looking at me?
Stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and free
Why are you looking at me?
Man, stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and me

[Verse 2]
I thought "please Lord, make me thin"
"Paint my pasty skin"
"Take me out of this funny frame you've placed me in"
My face is ginger while my head hair is mousey brown
But I turned my doubts around
My thoughts are more healthy now
I quit searching for the perfect physique
I'd prefer to be a person that people feel at ease with when first we meet
See, it's not just about how you look when you're out with your friends
It's about whether you are looking out for your friends

[Chorus] (x2)
Why are you looking at me?
Stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and free
Why are you looking at me?
Man, stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and me

[Verse 3]
I'm no Michaelangelo's David
My stature isn't classical
Sod a perfect body
Mine's autobiographical
Every flaw, every blemish, every scar
Is a natural tattooed testament to how I got this far
Cosmetics and excrement, I can't detect the difference
Except that the expensive one is what you want to get for Christmas
My head's significantly bigger than average
You'll laugh when you see me getting a hat fitted
It's the massivest
But that's the thing, it's a trivial matter
Except when acceptance happens to be the thing that you're after
Call me an ignorant rapper, spitting the dumbest rhymes
But you can stick your opinion where the sun doesn't shine
And for a chap my bum's more like Nicki's than Miley's
What a kick in the hiney
But so what? My friends think of me highly
Despite my glitches, they think that I'm the nicest guy
We like a bit of variety
It's the spice of life

[Chorus] (x2)
Why are you looking at me?
Stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and free
Why are you looking at me?
Man, stuff your physique
Beauty's skin deep, I'd rather be ugly and me
