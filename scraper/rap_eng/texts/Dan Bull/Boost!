[Verse 1]
In the past, the internet
Didn't have video yet
Then there came a website
Called YouTube to make it right

240p
Was the size of a video
And the audio
Was mono, not stereo

You could not upload a song
Longer than ten minutes long
Then we got a data boost
New features were introduced

[Verse 2]
Quality increased from 240 pixels in 360
And YouTube added an option to watch videos in 3GP
Hey, hey!

Netflix, Ustream, Roku and, let's not forget Apple TV
Another data boost as we got used to browsing audiovisually
Eee, eee

[Verse 3]
Suddenly, we're in the realm of HD
A whole new level of quality
720p
And we went from 4:3
Black bars on the side to full widescreen

With faster data plans and broadband
It's like your holding a whole cinema in your hand
I hope you brought your 3D specs
So you can see what's coming up next

[Verse 4]
720p was clearly never sufficient
So boost to 1080, improve your vision of the screen
As the videos streams
Automatic subtitles transcribe your speech

Vevo, ThumbsUp, and HTML5
I can't imagine the size of the disk drives, it's like
Bandwidth gets bigger every minute
We need another data boost just so we can keep up with it

[Verse 5]
The scene's a sea, we're swimming deep within it
Singers, streamers, comedians, memers
Keen
It seems we're keen to reach the limit
It's our forte

Everything that came before was foreplay
But of course were going to raise the rate to 4K
With more frames

Enabling smoother views of your games
YouTubers are huge news for the new youth
Old media bequeathing the future an leaving it to you
I think you know by now what we need to do: boost

[Verse 6]
Now it's natural that we are
Becoming compatible with VR
Caviar
Running in 8K color space capable of displaying HDR

360 degrees, it must seen for it to be believed
It must be heard Just like the world "skrrt skrrt"
I don't know what that even means

All I know is everything is getting more excessive
Every morning I see something that is ever more impressive
All my messages amassing even faster than I get em
The progression is so fast that I cannot even get a breath in

What do you think of the fact bringing the track back from the beginning of rap fresh as cinnamon baps and in the middle of that, Dan's reminiscing about video stats, still managing to kill it with brilliant facts?
He really is fast
