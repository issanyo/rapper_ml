[Intro]
(Culling in the name of)
Culling in the name of
(Culling in the name of)
Culling in the name of
(Culling in the name of)

[Verse 1]
I'm the monster hunter
The one that wants to punch you
So hard your lungs are punctured
'Til you're just a stumbling drunkard
Interrupting your luncheon
Rupture the structure
Of your bodily functions
No dungeons here
Au contraire
We're in the open air
Making sure the coast is clear
Toasting them like toast from bread
Never mind having a open mind
I'll give you an open head
Like hitting post malone with a blow that has broke every bone
You're stony dead
It'll be a long day of slaying monsters
Before i go home to bed

[Chorus]
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster?
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
Culling in the name of

[Verse 2]
Smashing up an ecosystem in the name of research
Leaving no stone unturned
Collecting the achievements
I don't like variety and biodiversity
Banned from every animal sanctuary
Just 'cause I did a murder spree
Got kicked out of the hunter's guild
'Cause I lost count of the monsters killed
But still when it comes to spelling skins off things
No one's as skilled
We may well end up obliterated
Because these fellows are sophisticated
So unless you wish to end up in a vegetative state
We'd better be quick
Better get creative
Now I know I'm not a native
I'm a mammal that's invasive
And I'm coming face to face with another one of God's creations
An ominous abomination
And one of us is going to slay shit
Displace him
And then display his place in nature's chain of domination
And I'm no uncommon basic bully, look making no accommodation
Fully booked
Coming at you like a bloody truck
With the force of this forthcoming hook:

[Chorus]
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster?
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
Cullin in the name of
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Which one of us is the real monster?
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Which one of us is the real monster?

[Verse 3]
I'm sending out the scout flies:
Now guys
Go and help find me a nobel prize
That's about the size of a house in Dubai
I tell him to jump
They Replay "how high"
How could I not be out my mind
When I'm never knowing whether I'm about to die
Between the jaws in the maw of a mouth
Incisors
Coming down like a bout of menningitis
Si I live fast, die hard
Shout and cry this:
Come on everybody, get down tonight
Yes
Nicked that line from an eminem track
That's a rhyme that he'll never get back
Anyone who wants it can come and get ir
Like it's KSI's belt or a bit of negative feedback
See that?
When I lurk in the shruberry
They're unaware of their forthcoming buggery
Mother nature made something ugly
I look at them the same way they look at me
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Which one of us is the real monster?

[Chorus]
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster?
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
When the prey meets the gaze of the hunter
Tearing the past apart
From dawn 'til after dark
Which one of us is the real monster
Launch torpedoes at the ark
Vandals trashing Jurassic Park
