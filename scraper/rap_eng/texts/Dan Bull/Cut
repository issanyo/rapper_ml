And I don't know what it is but I think I like you
And I think I'd like it if you liked me too
And I don't know what it is but I think I like you
And I think I'd like it if you liked me too
And I don't know what it is but I think I like you
And I think I'd like it if you liked me too

Things are different since that you're there
This must be that thing they call love
My vision shift from grey to colour
This must be that thing they call love
Things are different since that you're there
My vision shift from grey to colour
This must be that thing they call love
This must be that thing they call love

It's been four or five years since we talked now but I
Never thought so high of any girl in all of my life
I thought you were gorgeous, warm and bright
You taught me all sorts and brought me to life
L'amour and more besides
When you spoke to my folks you were always polite
Though you always tried to hide that you were awfully shy
And how you'd always call me gorgeous was nice
I saw in your eyes I was more than just like
Some sort of ordinary guy of the ordinary type
It all just seemed right when you joined me at night
Then lay nattering, chatting and talking 'til light
I was that infatuated I could fall for you twice
We'd take lonely walks in August with Spice
Make phone calls and talk 'til morning sunrise
You were so great I thought you must have fallen from the sky
I couldn't wait for the day I could call you my wife
And gaze at your face through morning and night
Safely sailing away with my glorious bride
It's a shame that my mates didn't warn me in time
You were faithless and fake, it was all just a lie
You gave no warning, or a goodbye
You just stalled me, ignoring my calls and the like
So inform me - were you always unkind
Or did you morph to this poor form, absorbed in your spite
That liked to torture me with scornful calls, taunt me with guys
Flaunt them right by me and causing these fights
You were warping my mind with all of your lies
But I bet your side of the story's forty leagues from mine
Sure, you just sort of got bored of me, right?
Once the source of your light, now a thorn in your side
I'm a cautious guy so it tore me inside
It floored me forlornly cos I thought we were tight
I missed most of sixth form, withdrawn from my life
Spent all my nights smoking draw, drinking wine
When I saw you I'd go maudlin and cry
When I thought of you lying with some poor other guy
I had violent thoughts of all different types
And all through the times you would call me up crying
You didn't even inform me you were poorly or why
So of course I had a reason or a cause to be frightened
I thought I'd be caught in causing your suicide
So I pray for your sake that you sorted your life
But Christ, falling for you was an unfortunate choice
And yeah, I've been a wanker, I've been an arsehole
But leave it at that and the track's only half told
When I'm an old cold man with a hardened soul
I'll look back on the past as that when I had a heart of gold
But in my heart there's a hole
That you made, and it's taken ages to get the heartache controlled
It'd taken a hold, Taken its toll
Making me wholly incapable of attaining my goals
The strain of the whole weight on my shoulders
Is aching, my composure is breaking, I'm going insane, oh god

You were mine
And mine forever
A minor error
You were mine
