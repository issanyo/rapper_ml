[Intro: Dan Bull]
You have to love yourself a fire
You have to love yourself a fire
You have to love yourself a fire
The dusty west is wild
And nothing much will sate your lust or quell desire

[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
My name is Arthur Morgan
My aim: to stay as far from lawmen as I can
And if I can, I might just try to cause them torment
Then after our performance, fill the glass and start the pouring
No bartering, we'd rather start the brawling, piling all in
Call us Javi, Bill, Dutch, the Marstons
Mastering the form of lawlessness we're all accustomed to
It's part of our calling
Probably causing our falling down, too, but now it's awesome
The stories are all true, we blew them out of proportion

[Pre-Hook]
You have to love yourself a fire
You have to love yourself a fire
Dan Bull, I'm the punslinger for hire
But I need a legion quick
What good's a hook without the choir?

[Hook: Bonecage]
I found a friend whose name is "gun"
A holy man whose fee is blood
A rotten root is born to run
A tumbleweed keeps rolling as it burns
I picked a plot to make my stand
The Devil deals with the hardened man
Hell's hot, but I love the band

[Verse 2]
From the mountain hill down to the mouth of where the river lies
At its basin, this place ain't no such thing as civilized
It's like you chew tobacco, your mouth is full of bitter lies
And if there's any kids about, then cover up their little eyes
I strongly suggest it
Unless you want a big surprise
Don't want to see what's left of who we're about to victimize
That isn't the Dutch I know
Grabbing the blunderbuss and blow
I can tussle loads of tortoises alone
Rucking raccoons, coyotes and crows
When buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo
That's a fuckload of buffaloed buffalo
But for love and money, I am tougher though
Have you seen me chuck a rope across a raging steer?
Even with no mirror, they are closer up than they appear
Pick up your boots and and braces
Buckle up and do your laces
Fill up your canteen, don't give a damn what it could be laced with
This bloody place is lovely, spacious, wide, light and airy
Before we dine in Hell, tonight we ride the prairie

[Pre-Hook]
You have to love yourself a fire
You have to love yourself a fire
Far from someone you can trust, devout and pious
Crooked liar, look out behind
Because I'm just about to fire

[Hook]
I found a friend whose name is "gun"
A holy man whose fee is blood
A rotten root is born to run
A tumbleweed keeps rolling as it burns
I picked a plot to make my stand
The Devil deals with the hardened man
Hell's hot, but I love the band

[Verse 3]
This track's for those who want to go back to Wild West
No piles of debt, no tax, no IRS
This track's for those who want to go back to the manly alpha
No civil rights, no anaesthetic, no family welfare
This track's for those who want to prove their masculinity
Without having the need to even leave their swivel seat
This track's for those who want to make America great
Whether again or for the first time
They're blazing up in every state
And once the fire's started, then the lionhearted men
Women and children who lie apart just might unite again
Look at the state of you, look at the state of the union, too
We're waiting for a statement, what are you going to do?
Pick up your boots and and braces
Buckle up and do your laces
Fill up your canteen, don't give a damn what it could be laced with
This bloody place is lovely, spacious, wide, light and airy
Before we dine in Hell, tonight we ride the prairie

[Pre-Hook]
You have to love yourself a fire
You have to love yourself a fire
Enemies are rising, I might just as well retire
Nah, light the brush they're hiding in and flush them out with fire

[Hook]
I found a friend whose name is "gun"
A holy man whose fee is blood
A rotten root is born to run
A tumbleweed keeps rolling as it burns
I picked a plot to make my stand
The Devil deals with the hardened man
Hell's hot, but I love the band

[Outro]
You have to love yourself a fire
