JT:
I'm an Enderman, like a Slenderman
I'll find your daughter on MySpace and friend her man
You won't believe that I'm a tender man, ha
Well, maybe not, but I pretend I am
When you're around me, be gentle man
And when you look at me in the eye try not to wet your pants
I'm an Enderman, with my ender clan
And you're just another piece to my ender plan

DB:
On the third day, God mad the Earth, hey
I'm pretty sure that means today's my birthday, yay!
Yeah, I'm the dirtblock, the first block you break
Without me you'd be lost for days
No trees, no grass, no farms, no fruit
No chance to level up and get that lovely loot
I'm a fundamental element part of every land
To beat me, Enderman, you'd better invent a better plan

Chorus:
This whole fight is kinda pointless
Let's just kick back and enjoy this
Enderman vs. Dirtblock
Weirdest shit I've heard of
I'll bet two pork chops on the tall guy
Double or nothing on the short guy
Hope this doesn't take a long time
Take a seat, we might be here all night

JT:
I'm an Enderman, cuz I said I am
I'll steal a block from your house cuz I said I can
When I said I'm better, yes, I meant it, man
You can't even rap...ok, I guess you can
I'm a scary dude. that is very true
You can't even walk around, but i'll carry you
I'll go find another block for you to talk to
Before you drop another bar, I might just drop you
And then i'll drop some dubstep too

(Enderman Dubstep, cut short by Dirtblock)

DB:
Right.....
I keep it simple, I'm not difficult to render
Stare you in the face and make you lose your temper
Yeah, i'll put out the eyes of Ender
Put 'em in a blender, then return to sender
I'm a Dirtblock, I'm blowing up like the Hurt Locker
You just repeat the same gimmick like a hopper
Oooh, see the stupid magic trick that he can do?
Bitch, how's it feel to have a meter cube beating you?

Hook:
Alright, Alright. Let's Settle This Rivalry Survival Style

Give up now, Enderman

You'd Like That, Wouldn't You?

For every one of you, there's thousands of me

Yeah, But I Can Walk On You All Day

What?!

Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha

And don't forget

Yeah?

I know how to fight dirty

JT:
I didn't wanna have to say this, I held it back
But you're the kind of guy I'd wipe on my welcome mat
Rap battle with an Enderman is asking for trouble
All I need to beat you (pause for effect) is a shovel
You'll be pushing up daisies from underground
Ha, that was good, someone write that down
Okay, let's call a truce before this gets ugly
I gotta make sure the Ender Ladies still love me

DB:
YAH You couldn't make a friend, Enderman, poor you
Everywhere you walk, people always ignore you
All you do is jump around, stand and stop
Make funny sounds move random blocks, thanks a lot, cock
I keep it underground, while you just wander round
So I think it's obvious which one of us just won the round
But if you're still not sure which one of us is a bigger name
Look, I'm the actual icon for the fricken game!
