[Intro]
We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't... ah, forget it

Born in the ashes

[Verse 1]
Each night I used to dream of being a fighter
It seemed to me to be the right key for me to strive for
I mindlessly believed I'd lead a life of real excitement
Heedless of the peace of mind I'd need to leave behind for it
I lay to rest the playful innocent days I was a lad
Now I'm driven by the hate to vindicate my mum and dad
Eliminate the man who won't discriminate 'tween good and bad
Flay him with the blade I made and feel the pain I've suffered
That whoreson ripped away the pure fulfilment that I could have had
So should you ask me if I'd love to kill him: Well yeah, just a tad
I'll thrust and stab him 'til he's just a sack of blood and rags
Then drag him through the gutter, shove him back into his mother's vag
Gather the ashes of the pillaged village and then build a palace
We'll fill a chalice and then tilt it out for Silver Skalitz

[Chorus]
Born in the ashes of a joy torn away from me
I was a boy whose dreams turned round and now they're chasing me
Born in the ashes of a simple and wholesome being
I was a boy whose goals turned round unfolding in ways unseen
Born in the ashes

[Verse 2]
Sharp metal leaves a vicious cut, but nettle leaves'll fix it up
Our quest'll being inflicting justice on the beasts who think it's nothin'
So run to Sigismund, give him the signal, this is coming
And that imprisonment isn't the system with which he'll be punished
He'll witness his kingdom coming down without deliverance
As brick and rubble crumbles, crushing his ambition into dust
I'm just a humble smith's son who won't be pissed on
Who won't stop thinking of you gettin' hung 'til it's done
You'll tell me what I need to know or there'll be fists swung
A knuckle sandwich always loosens up a stiff tongue
Witness the son of a blacksmith giving someone a slapped wrist
With a couple of axes, the fact is, your death is a certain as taxes
Gather the ashes of the pillaged village and then build a palace
We'll fill a chalice and then tilt it out for Silver Skalitz

[Chorus]
Born in the ashes of a joy torn away from me
I was a boy whose dreams turned round and now they're chasing me
Born in the ashes of a simple and wholesome being
I was a boy whose goals turned round unfolding in ways unseen
Born in the ashes

[Verse 3]
I know I'm no genius, but no leader of Bohemia's so lenient
That they won't see me looking like I'm lacking obedience
I don't show allegiance to no thieving deviants
Or show weakness, I grow freely from home grown ingredients
I will train until our name and the vow I made are renowned
A phrase that'll travel way throughout the reign resound and make any man afraid
Who are now engaged in power plays, they'll have a case of sour grapes
They'll bow in shame, marrow, veins, bowel and brains will drown in pain
Flowers placed on a shallow grave, hell awaits you
But now Satan's an hour late at the tower gates
The panel breaks and the foundations
Now shaking, ground quaking, devout placing our faith
In the hallowed grace and marinade it 'til the arrows rain, the spell, it breaks
Nothing can heal the damage, this anguish will not vanish
The grief's so real, it's not a feeling I'll reveal with language
But Radzig Kobyla's got the will to help dispel the hell
Let's never stop until we've got the steel that killed your dad
Let's gather the ashes of the pillaged village and then build a palace
We'll fill a chalice and then tilt it out for Silver Skalitz

[Chorus]
Born in the ashes of a joy torn away from me
I was a boy whose dreams turned round and now they're chasing me
Born in the ashes of a simple and wholesome being
I was a boy whose goals turned round unfolding in ways unseen
Born in the ashes

[Outro]
Born in the ashes
