I've suffered cold nights
Discovered old shrines
Dug in gold mines
Won untold fights
Knocked back whole pints of mulled wine
Endeavored to climb
And weather the heights
'Til every dragons soul's mine
Solved the civil war
That split the soil
Like a fault line
But I'm getting bored
Of being in the borders
Of Skyrim for the whole time
So hold tight
As we all ride into Solstheim
I'm the bold type
Like the lines inside the Black Books
Open it up
And it grabs and sucks you in
So take a last look
At whatever you stepped in
When treading ahead
In this general direction
Better get protection
Cause the whole town's
Gone down with a fungal infection
A fuming human
Thu'uming
At the top of my head, shouting
From Raven Rock
All the way to the top
Of the Red Mountain
I can rap with incredible force
Twice as fast as ever before
My legacy
Odyssey
Elegy
Prophecy
Leveled it up
To incredible rocket speed
So you better be paying a bit of attention
Cause every day I'm penning my name ahead of the game
Getting insanely better at saying
Bloody everything
A miracle of lyrical ascension
By the Nine
What an entrance
By the time
You've tried that rhyme
Man, I'll be lining for my pension
And Miraak
He's Dragonborn
But he lacks
These badass horns
And can he spit a record of a syllable a millisecond?
I really don't reckon he can at all
