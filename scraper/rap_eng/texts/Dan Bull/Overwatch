[Hook]
Oh
Watch over me
While you choose
Who you're going to be
Oh
Watch over me
While you show
The globe what you're going to be

[Verse 1]
Ha
You're here for heroes
With no distraction
So don't wait, hit quick play
And get straight to the action
It's Bastion
Blasting baskets of bullets at factions
The turret look's back and in fashion
Reinhardt'll ride hard as a hammer on a stallion
Chivalry's alive but he's not asking if he can marry you
Valiant as Pharah, human jump jet
Harrier
Blasting a barrage with the power to sink galleons
Zarya singing an aria
Bringing a cannon
And flinging a barrier
Strong as a mountain
Benching a thousand pounds
So bound to be able to carry you
No matter whatever you are
It's rare that you're really as hard
As a gorilla in armour
We'll win in an instant
When Winston's bananas
Wince and witness Zenyatta send out an orb
Of harmony, destruction, or discord
Forged in the core of war, it's Torbj√∂rn
Watch him erect a new form of dwarf porn
Here's a fun fact
Out in the Outback, Junkrat
Tick tock boomed and kaboomed
Like the kick on this drumtrack
Then when you reckon this rap's run amok
I pull a Roadhog
And drag you right back with the hook

[Hook]
Oh
Watch over me
While you choose
Who you're going to be
Oh
Watch over me
While you show
The globe what you're going to be

[Verse 2]
Reaper sweeps through the ether while death blossoms
Shadow step and spank
Leave you with a red bottom
McCree's Peacekeeper seeks any head honcho
Put a bullet through their head
Like a head through a poncho
It's high noon
Better ride soon if we're to reach Korea
GG fever
See D.Va's mech wreak, wreck, then eject careers
Irrespective what a reflection's trajectory is
Symmetra projects technicolor retinal tears and tears
If you're feeling hurty
Get a heal off Mercy
The hippocratic pacifist
A fit bird, literally
We've heard music only makes existence richer
Lucio throws the switch
Tones and notes composing us a picture
We're all Soldier: 76
Except we'll never be ripped
American kids getting to grips
With intricate weapons as heavy as bricks
Tracer'll race in the place
At a pace that'll make you say you're seeing stuff
Blink and you'll miss her blink
Like your ping isn't in sync
Cheers, luv

[Hook]
Oh
Watch over me
While you choose
Who you're going to be
Oh
Watch over me
While you show
The globe what you're going to be

[Verse 3]
Mei's the weather woman
Summon ice age and blizzards
Wither as you shiver in the bitter river
With a bit of couldn't give a whether you are triggered
And Widowmaker would have made a wicked woman in a Winnebago
Because her aim is homing in
From far away to wherever they go
Hanzo, the man bow
Samurai commando
Dragonstrike arrows
Still life like a van Gogh
From Kyoto to Tokyo
Bringing mojo to the dojo
It's Genji chucking a hurricane of shuriken
Encouraging a low pose
You're ducking, looking like Quasimodo
No joke
I'm a showboat that throws blows
At so-so joe blows when I no scope
Dead as dodos
Oh no
So watch over me
And decide who you're going to be

[Hook]
Oh
Watch over me
While you choose
Who you're going to be
Oh
Watch over me
While you show
The globe what you're going to be
