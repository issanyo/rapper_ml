(Why the teardrops keep on falling from my eyes)

[Verse]
Look
I can't walk the streets at night
Without seeing violence, people fighting
Drunk girls on their knees and crying
No wonder young people feel a need to buy drink
But it's not to do with alcohol
It's about losing self control
You'd sell your soul to get out this hole
So you keep digging down like hell's your goal
Your troubles double a thousand fold
It's happening in countless households now, it's cold
You got a new phone, replaced the old model
But you ain't got a role model
And you won't find one at the bottom of a bottle
But what I want to know is
How can England get better in health
Without an inch of respect for herself?
It brings tears to my eyes...
