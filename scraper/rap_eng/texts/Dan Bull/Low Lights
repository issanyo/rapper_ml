[Verse]
Oh, low lights
Low lights
Lights that are low
Lights that are low
I ain't talkin' about highlights
They got too much limelight
If we lay in low light
Then it's no light

Yeah, I'm talking about low lights
Low good to go lights
Those steal the whole goddamn show lights
Them good ol' (coughs)
Low lights
