I'm having trouble with Google+
Cause I don't know who to trust
Twitter? Facebook? Two's enough
Do we need another place for stupid stuff?
Remember MySpace?
It was a nice place
'til Facebook made it a giant waste
Now MySpace Tom uses Google
So it's clear which one's more useful
1 + 1 is 2
But if you only get one +1
It's poo
Lots of filters for content anew
But there's not one that tells us
What bit is true
It's doubtful to me
I can helpfully glean that
From the crap moving up and down on my screen
I've run out of steam
With the amount in my stream
But in cyberspace, who can tell when you scream?

600,000,000 people like me
Like this
Are you taking the piss
Or is there something I've missed?

My social ties are total lies
But I'm too tied in
To show you why
I'm totally fly when I socialize
I've got a bigger Circle
Than the goatse guy
Though, I'm uncertain how Circles work
Is it some kind of circle jerk?
Cause it seems to me
That the Hangout
Is just a place for good mates
To get their wang out
Hang about, I don't want to stand out
I'm just trying to protect my ring
Like Gandalf
And nowadays, staying private's an art
Michelangelo's David's private parts
Couldn't be more on the view than you
So I might as well use my googlies
As a Google Doodle
When Google doesn't know
What I'm Googling
They know my shoe size
My bowel movements
And the mood I'm in
The bits I miss
When I do the hoovering
And with whom I'm canoodling
Never mind recycling
Move me to the loony bin
If Google's the future
Then losers are Ãœbermensch
