[Intro]
I am Andrew Ryan
And I'm here to ask you a question...

[Verse 1]
Is a man not entitled to the sweat of his brow?
The Man in Moscow would spread it to the rest of the crowd
The Man in Washington would offer it to the lazy and the poor
He in the Vatican would proffer as he prays to the Lord
I rejected those philosophies as backward
They squandered men's prospects, economies were fractured
I shunned detractor's ideologies, shrugged off the Atlas
Adapted Adam's Eden for the man who manufactures
I chose what was impossible to capture
I chose... Rapture
Where artists can work free from controversial quarrels
And scientists can pioneer beyond the world of morals
And with the sweat of your brow
Rapture can become your city as well
Join me, Andrew Ryan
Follow my dream
Find me, finally
Join me, would you kindly?

[Hook]
Rapture... is coming back to life
Her lungs fill with the will to survive
Rapture... is coming back to life
Finding truth between the lines in a book full of lies
Rapture... is coming back to life
Shops and schools humming with the thoughts of young minds
Rapture... is coming back to life
My city will live, my city will thrive

[Verse 2]
Being restricted by minor men was tiring to me
If no land was fit to witness the might of Ryan Industries
Then I'd find a ship to fit my vision, try it in the deep
Besides, you can build towers higher from the sea
With Ayn Rand guiding my hand, our divine plan
Transcended flights of fancy or lines in the sand
Deep, deep beneath the waves, under untold bars of pressure
A dark castle full of Art Deco architecture
Part venture capitalist investor, part art director
Hard Objectivism's the correct decision, disregard the lecture
I'm part card shark, part card collector
Part father figure, part protector, part corrector
Part confessor, part professor, dot connector, lie detector
Part Tsar, projector of a spark, settler, tower erector
A man chooses, a slave obeys
So would you kindly? Powerful phrase

[Hook]
Rapture... is coming back to life
Her lungs fill with the will to survive
Rapture... is coming back to life
Finding truth between the lines in a book full of lies
Rapture... is coming back to life
Shops and schools humming with the thoughts of young minds
Rapture... is coming back to life
My city will live, my city will thrive

[Break]
Would you kindly... subscribe to this channel?
Would you kindly... buy the MP3?

[Hook]
Rapture... is coming back to life
Her lungs fill with the will to survive
Rapture... is coming back to life
Finding truth between the lines in a book full of lies
Rapture... is coming back to life
Shops and schools humming with the thoughts of young minds
Rapture... is coming back to life
My city will live, my city will thrive
