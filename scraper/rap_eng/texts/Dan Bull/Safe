I've hungered enough for the humblest stuff
From running the country to just someone to love
But enough is enough, I'm done with the world
So I'll succumb and return us to the substance we come from
We see bubbles above the submarine
As I plunge us deep, three-hundred leagues under the sea
There's a feeling of release as as our feelings are released
And we feel immediately at peace
It's less easy to see as the light fades
And my face is emblazoned with night's shade
I wait as the sides of the ride shake
And vibrate like they're portraying my mindstate
I'm inside, safe, encased in a cocoon
But soon it'll take my life away
But I made the choice to die today
So I may aswell enjoy the ride

Man, you are spoiled and you've
Thrown your toys out the pram
It's these moments of silliness
That spoil it for every two one

No longer am I looking into the sky
I'm seeing into your eye
