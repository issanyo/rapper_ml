[Intro]
Listen

[Verse 1: Beit Nun]
When it comes to my health I've been pretty lucky
But luck doesn't last forever
I need to look after myself better
My body cannot reject these chemicals at this rate of consumption
I'm thirty and feel I'm failing to function
But how do you change the ways of a drunked
These bags under my eyes tell a sorry tale of a sunk ship
Studying footprints made when I crushed tins
And not before as I suffer in the wake of a drug binge
They say some things really should have been mentioned
It's just too deep, but that's me and such is depression
I've had a couple spells, [? 0:43] tell me they couldn't tell me
Because just as well, when their sympathy wouldn't help
These [dollars? 0:48] were sent to test me
And I'm inspired to get up when seeing my dude Goodman deal with his epilepsy
Never should let it stress me, but Nick had a heart attack at just 26
Man this life thing is getting heavy
It's gonna catch up with me sometime
And old age hasn't been very kind to my bloodline
You see, it isn't all sunshine, never assume
That people aren't going through living hell 'cause they look fine
Simple and plain, if it wasn't for their medication
The several mates of mine might not be living today
I thank mans progression for these visual aids
That I wear for impaired sight as my life and what a difference [? 1:19]

[Verse 2: Deeflux]
This goes out to my guide in light, my star
Always looking out for others, and she even gifted me my heart
There's two types of people in life
Those that suffer in silence, screaming inside
And those that need to take a few along for the ride
And she's the first, never wanting to bring worry and strife
Suffering with constant pain that doesn't let up
Never resting on laurels, never resting it up
With the brittle bone syndrome holding us down
Still, holding my daughter, still soldiering up
Certain things being going on long
I'm just finding out now and I'm finding it odd
She just plays [? 1:51] beyond what I have in my heart
There's so much more, where do I start?
She's somebody that is so important to so many and [? 1:59]
Such a daily inspiration to keep going it hard, it's ma'

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
There's a weight to carry every second that I'm conscious
A hidden illness making people think I may be bonkers
In a society where seeing is believing
There rarely seems to be belief for we who really need it
If I was laying in the street and bleeding, not even breathing
Then maybe naysayers would be made to really rethink
See, just because something isn't visible
Doesn't mean it isn't physical, it could be critical
Dealing with this may be a bitter full
I need to dig and find my way out of this pit of feeling pitiful
I flipped in life, feeling like I didn't fit at all
Avoiding, evading events potentially difficult
Then as soon as I started to fix my life up
My health fell right into the shitter, what a mindfuck
So now it's back to the start and back to square one
Don't be proud if someone offers you a plaster

[Verse 4: Benny Diction]
