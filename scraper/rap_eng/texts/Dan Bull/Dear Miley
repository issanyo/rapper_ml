[Verse 1]
Dear Miley
My name's Daniel (Hi)
I've never really been a big fan of yours
I'm a musician too, amateur
But anyway, let me tell you what I am here for
You want to take a hammer to Hannah Montana
And vanish her
That is a plan I would have as your manager
But the manner that you're handling
It's going to damage you
Never underestimate the power of the camera
Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose
I said, Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose

[Hook]
Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose
(2x)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know girls just want to have fun
But Cyndi Lauper never flaunted her bum much
See, you're in a funny position
Every time you speak, young girls listen
They want to be like you, different
So they copy your moves and lose innocence
I tried twerking, it wasn't working
My balls kept slapping my thighs and it was hurting
There are blurred lines between empowerment
And the first time people seeing down the front of your dress
Not to mention the rest
Sometimes being censored is best
This is just a guess, but I'm sensing there's stress
You're either a diva or sensitive mess
Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose

[Hook]
Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose
(2x)

[Verse 3]
My God, have you heard what she's done? (What now?)
I don't know, but I bet her tongue popped out
One day when the cheeks of your bum drop down
You'll have nothing left but your lungs and a hot sound
Right now, you've got pop locked down
But come middle age, you'll be washed out
I don't want to hear you've lost out for some quick dollars
The way the industry's treating people, it's bollocks
I see the wrecking ball as a metaphor
For what could happen to you during the menopause
When applause dies out, there is then a pause
And then you wonder what you acted like a lemon for

[Bridge]
Sin√©ad O'Connor
She ain't your momma
But she doesn't deserve to have the piss taken of her, no
(2x)

[Verse 4]
See me, I'm really pretty good with words, but
I managed this without ripping my shirt off
I've tried a few stunts, but not this
How seriously can you take me when I'm topless?
Mmm, yeah I like it
I'm better at music now
How else could I act for additional hits?
I could hold up a cat while I jiggle my tits
Look at my boobies, look at my boobies
You'll see a heart
If you look straight through these
This isn't the movies or Looney Tunes
We are stuck with decision that we choose in our youth, see
Look at me, man, I'm standing in my pants
Don't I look silly when I'm doing this dance?
And I pull a face as if I'm pooing my pants
I want a long-term career, but I've ruined the chance

[Hook]
Miley, you've got nothing to prove
But you're behaving in a way
That says you've nothing to lose
(2x)

[Outro]
Of course, you're under no obligation
To pay any attention to those observations
But living a life with no moderation
Will lead to a load of complications
