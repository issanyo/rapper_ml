[Verse 1]
Blood Raves here again
Aim: Secure the spear of Khaine
And kill assasins making spurious claims against the realest reign
They came in vain
In chase of fame
Now they're facing steel in rain clouds
So they doubtless feel the strain when they hear our name
No fear of pain
The only fear we claim
Is the fear of shame
Of breaking the sacred and anicent consecration we're obeying
Should you see us kneeling
It's merely because we feel like praying
Been trained to persevere even when severely maimed
Bones disappear to bits of meal
Betwinxed gear and chain
If you're bleeding out we'll sear the vain with healing flame
And if you're still laying then you will forever here remain
But if your zeal attained us valor
You were not killed in vain

[Chorus]
In the Dawn of War
We fight hordes of Orks
Born to die
That's why we're brought here all
In the Dawn of War
We fight Eldar forces
Forfeit life
And all the glory's yours

[Verse 2]
I'm torn straight from the pages of White Dwarf
You can call me racist
But I just don't like Orks
It's a hatred formed inside I'm here to die for
It's the way that I was brought up don't call it my fault
Nor is it the fault of a soldier that's brought to Cyprus Ultima
Exited as I'd be to Cypher with Cypress Hill, Tolkien and Marshall
Multiple times while I'm holding the giant warhammer
Striking a Dulcimer
Salting the earth halting the rule of an adulterous sultanate
And what's the result  of it?
I'm the holder of dark knowledge
Devoted to pass on the culture like Marc Collins
Barbarus?
Far from it. I'm rather more like a barber is
'Cause i chop peices of people off for a living and finds it marvelous

[Chorus]
In the Dawn of War
We fight hordes of Orks
Born to die
That's why we're brought here all
In the Dawn of War
We fight Eldar forces
Forfeit life
And all the glory's yours

[Verse 3]
I navigate my way across the blood river
The thick hot ichor hits like a shot of good liqour
Invigorated, digging craters with the god splitter
In a baptism of viscera
What an odd vicar
So stop chitter chattering, there isn't a sod sicker
Dropping cadavers like a Chav'd drop litter
Now let me tell any Ork gang:
If you thought Dan would allow you to walk on his back like a doormat then you're attacking a strawman
Stroll in under the fold of a torn banner
Holding a warhammer
While I'm picking out all matters of holes in your grammar
You're soaking your pants like a bloke with an overly full bladder
What's that in your ballsack?
Fuck all twat
Oh snap

[Chorus]
In the Dawn of War
We fight hordes of Orks
Born to die
That's why we're brought here all
In the Dawn of War
We fight Eldar forces
Forfeit life
And all the glory's yours

[Outro]
It's hardly difficult for the brain to pick up is it?
Maybe you'll get it when the Angel Garbriel pays you a visit
It's hardly difficult for the brain to pick up is it?
Maybe you'll get it when the Angel Garbriel pays you a visit
