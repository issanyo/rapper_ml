[Verse 1]
It's Genji Shimada
Armed with an array
Of arms and armour
The katana dragonblade
Slashing at a rapid rate
Happy to decapitate
Not the kinda fellow you wanna pass in an alleyway
What kinda fate shall await?
I don't wanna say
I don't wanna elaborate
He might retaliate
Spreading a fan of blades
Like jam or marmalade
You're a Jaffa Cake on a plate
He's Manson, you're Sharon Tate
Doesn't always get along with the family
Feud longer than the filler for an anime
Nearly killed by your brother but rebuilt
They cut through you like they cut through silk
Body of a cyborg
Soul of a warrior
Apologise now
Else soon you'll be sorrier
Brotherly love cannot be halted
Although it can falter
Blood is always thicker than water
Skipping up walls with the agility of millipedes
He could be employed as a portable guillotine

Neither man nor machine
He's - Going ham for the team

[Chorus]
Oh no!
It's Genji chucking a hurricane of shuriken
And encouraging a low pose
So much more than the sum of his parts
He's whole
A steady blade balances the soul
(soul, soul, soul, soul)
A steady blade balances the soul

[Verse 2]
Oh no!
You better shush right now
Keep your lips tight
'Cause you just might be someone he dislikes
Bringing a shuriken to a fist fight
Slashing with his Wakizashi
Passing with a swift strike
Stopping you mid stride
So sit tight
'Cause it's like you're hitchhiking
Pitch dark at midnight
So you'll never see the viper you've been bit by
The light dims
The venom filling your insides
You haemorrhage heavily
Then eventually head heavenward
A fair way to go
Weaponry swinging like a seven wood
So you better shush right now
Keep your lips tight
Otherwise goodbye
See you on the flipside

[Chorus]
Oh no!
It's Genji chucking a hurricane of shuriken
And encouraging a low pose
So much more than the sum of his parts
He's whole
A steady blade balances the soul
(soul, soul, soul, soul)
A steady blade balances the soul

A steady blade balances the soul
