[Intro]
This is for Chelsea Manning
This is for Edward Snowden
This is for all the Whistleblowers who we'll never know
And this is for Anonymous
This is for Avaaz
The following lyrics are going to be particularly
HAAA-AAA-AAA-AAA-AAR-shh

[Verse 1]
How long before they're storing all of it?
They know my lyrics before I've recorded them
Shit's getting more and more Orwellian
How long before they hoard everything?
They know my Facebook wall messages
They can read my e-mails and it's all effortless
They know my porn preferences and dwarf fetishes
But they don't know what the difference between laws and ethics is
But know we've all found out what the F it is
We'd better give them a lesson in etiquette
You wanna heckle the Bolivian President?
You better give me some evidence
It'd be evident if you were meddling
In another government up in this web we're in
So I'm sending this to the President
You're setting a sickening precedent
Said I'm sending this to the President
You're setting a sickening precedent

Oh now that I've written a threatening letter
This kid is a dissident rebel
We better get him on the list of significant threats
With the rest of America
If you love your country, your country should love you too
But how can you trust someone who doesn't trust you?

Prism is a prison and the prisoner's your mind
Pulling out their pecker and they're pissing on your rights
So let's take a leaf out of their hands
And take a leak every opportunity we can
If you love your country, your country should love you too
But how can you trust someone who doesn't trust you?

I'm watching you, watching me
We're a drama scene
But the chemistry's not there
There's no Bonhomie
Mr. Obama needs to heed the words of Romney
Cause he's got binders full of everyone
It's morally fucked

[Hook]
The clock strikes thirteen on the dot
Another Whistleblower finds a little glowing spot
Right between his eyes in the middle of his forehead
For revealing lies his prize
Is that he falls dead

I'm watching you, watching me
Watching you, watching me
And between us there's a lot to see
We'd probably rather not have leaked
I'm watching you, watching me
Wondering to what degree
Your intercepts infringe my intellectual property

[Hook]
The clock strikes thirteen on the dot
Another Whistleblower finds a little glowing spot
Between his eyes in the middle of his forehead
For revealing lies his prize
Is that he falls dead

[Verse 2]
Someone at the National Security Agency
Could blatantly be paid a fee
Create a breach to basically mean any shady people
Are safe and free to take a peek
Look I don't believe in evil
But I believe in greed or paranoia
Power hungry, that's abusive
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
And I'll hammer that home 'til they have to shoot me
I'd be happy to head down the bookies
And bet that they're getting a good look at my cookies
They're up all night to get cookies
They're up all night to get cookies
They're up all night to get cookies
They're up all night to get cookies
And who took the cookies out the cookie jar
If you can't see that, then you aren't looking far

[Hook]
The clock strikes thirteen on the dot
Another Whistleblower finds a little glowing spot
Between his eyes in the middle of his forehead
For revealing lies his prize
Is that he falls dead

When the NSA watches everything we say
We've got to make sure we say what we really need to say
So hey there NSA
How are you today?
