[Intro]
I have a confession to make
There's no easy way to say this, so...
I'll just put it out there
I've... I've sold out
It's brilliant!

[Verse 1]
In year 7 at school I remember that all I aimed to be
Was a professional rapper, gamer or comedian
Well guess what, mate? (yea?) Today I'm all three of them
And we're saving up for payments to replace my faulty eardrums
I aspired to be "Eminem meets Monty Python"
With enough cash stockpiled to live my life on
And now I'm getting there I tell myself: "nice one"
While trolls send descriptions of the illness I should die from
Hello, is anybody home? Turn the lights on
Why do you think that you can tell me what to do in my song?
Don't construct a moral code that you expect me to adhere to
You're a mere shrew in a field of views
So I can't even hear you
Your opinion doesn't mean a thing to me
If I'd have listened to it, I wouldn't be in this industry
Wouldn't have made the friends I share a passion with
Travel with, make videos and have a stack of fun just rapping with

[Hook]
To make a living playing games? Hell yeah!
To make a living saying things? Hell yeah!
To start my day by writing rhymes? Hell yeah!
To never work a 9 to 5? Hell yeah!
To be my own manager? Hell yeah!
To get rich off what I did when I was amateur?
I'm the one that's doing things, the rest of you are talking
How can I have sold out? I never bought in

[Verse 2]
I rarely make a love song, prefer dropping lovebombs
But when it's time to spar, I'm the first to put the gloves on
Life is a prize fight for a shine of the limelight
And I'm loving every round of it, the Mike Tyson of my life
I remember dreading a 9 to 5, suit and tie
Talk about doing time, this was do or die
Socially acceptable type of suicide
Why should you or I let a single other human being rule our life
Life is an RPG, and we need more than XP
So larp with me; I won't charge a fee if you impress me
Do it deftly and there's no end to what you can get free
I love to chase success, I state that expressly
I've never compromised my mission or integrity
My mission is to do whatever I think's best for me
Eventually I'll write lyrics on flipping everything
Meanwhile I'll take a check to give the list a bit of editing

[Hook]
To make a living playing games? Hell yeah!
To make a living saying things? Hell yeah!
To start my day by writing rhymes? Hell yeah!
To never work a 9 to 5? Hell yeah!
To be my own manager? Hell yeah!
To get rich off what I did when I was amateur?
I'm the one that's doing things, the rest of you are talking
How can I have sold out? I never bought in

[Verse 3]
I'm not the Wolf of Wall Street
I'm just a Bull that's balls deep
In every opportunity for improvement I see before me
A song with product placement creates a complication
Even when accompanied by an honest statement
And if I want to be an honored statesman
I've got to make it proper blatant
So I'm only going to say it once:
My songs are entertainment, they're not a concrete statement
And if you take a rap track as fact, then you are mistaken
I'm not endorsing shit, unless I say it's good
I never have and never will tell a fib in exchange for paper
Perhaps your perspective would be turned round
If you'd assessed the prospective shit that I had turned down
I've spurned thousands of pounds from powerful people
'cause I found out just how they're treating creatures and it isn't peaceful
So, to all my critics and my haters, God bless
I'm not a sellout, nah, I'm a success
