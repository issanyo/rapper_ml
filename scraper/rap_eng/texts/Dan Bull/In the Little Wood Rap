[Verse 1]
Hey! Hey!
Look, he’s InTheLittleWood, real name Martyn
A tough bugger so you better not be starting
‘Cause if you’re rucking with the King of the Saplings
You’re gonna be on the receiving end of my backswing
Who can take Tekkit and wreck it without effort
Simultaneously quoting the poems of Samuel Beckett
Man, I just made up a fact, but feck it
Sometimes I come up with rubbish because I loved the auditory aesthetics
I suggest you grab a potion and neck it
‘Cause there’s a new LittleWood video, get Chrome up and check it
Woah! The pyrotechnics of his Oculus’ biometrics
Are so sweet that they’ll probably make you diabetic

[Hook]
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!

[Verse 2]
Is it a spelling mistake or something in my eye? No!
He really does spell Martyn with a ‘Y’, oh!
Holy moly he is globally known for being bros with SoTotallyToby
And although I know that evidence is purely anecdotal
We can hopefully overlook it and keep it low key
So why don’t we? Okie dokie!
Living in the Little Wood is more than a little good
Hairs on your chest is the sort of thing that it’ll put
So come and have a gander! Get in on the banter!
If you don’t, you’re an absolute… W-Wally?
And if you spy Martyn or Kaeyi
Don’t forget to politely say “Hai!”

[Hook]
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!

[Verse 3]
Who’s that blondie pops? The one we watch
On our phones, our PC screens and on the box
He’s got the keys to the RPG scene
He might be a beauty but you’ll never see him sleeping
He doesn’t just focus on hot things like a welder
He takes us back to the classics: Zelda!
He’s old school he doesn’t be no newbie
Jollier than Oliver from Ni No Kuni
Aww what a cutie, he’s all 2D
But if need be he’ll kick your booty like Bruce Lee
Leave you with a bruised knee so you better sit down!
Soz I didn’t mean to shout; that was a bit loud

[Hook]
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!

[Outro]
Who’m I rapping about? Who’m I rapping about?
Who’m I? Who’m I?
Who’m I rapping about? Yes, it’s LittleWood!
