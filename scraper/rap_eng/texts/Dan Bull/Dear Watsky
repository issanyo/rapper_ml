[Verse]
Dear George
This may seem a little premature
But let me inform and reassure you what I'm here for
See:
There's three of four MCs I simply adore
And I can't really afford for them to be ignored
They rap with purpose, challenge your belief and more
Than scratch the surface, Grand Wizard Theodore
You see, I hear you perform
And then I feel all tingly and warm
Like these things are seeing porn
Therefore:
I thought it'd be mint if we recorded
So if you want to do this thing, give me a call, it's
Another pale kid sitting in his bedsit
Spinning syllables in a ball, it's a head trip
I want to give props, though I'm not often a dick sucker
And it isn't often that I kiss butts
Yes, but it isn't often that I hear lyrics bringing this stuff
So let me pucker my lips up and give love
Your subtle lisp just gives a certain crispness
To your presence, like red ribbon at Christmas
You lyrically bring a vision, images and pictures
To widen the line of our sight like strabismus
Listeners reminice for the time
Rap was a little bit deeper than just the meniscus
You must have missed or dismissed this missive
That insists on simplistic lyrics to get hits
'Cause our business is a harsh mistress
When MCs receive more spins than a discus
But the chips don't stack quick, I'm left listless
So I might just get down with the thickness

But hold on, there's another way
Watch, see?
You can be a geek like me, Watsky
Or any other bugger keeping it real
With stuff for people to feel
Regardless of if it leads to a deal
The secret to really having fun for yourself
Is to differentiate between money and wealth
I spent years trying to be somebody else
And then I realised it wasn't good for my health

[Outro]
Rap's in need of a bit of positivity
So maybe a love letter is a good place to start
'Cause I love letters (hah)
Hey George, George
Isn't rap fun?
It's like weaving a tapestry of language
I luv it
Why don't more people do this?
Imagine if the great musicians, playwrights, poets of the past
Had this technology at their disposal
What would they do with it?
