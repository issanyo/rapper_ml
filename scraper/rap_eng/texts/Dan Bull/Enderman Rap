[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
Sit up and listen, I riff on the rhythm
The sickest musician, the slickest magician
Who'll slip and then zip into different positions
While lifting a brick with no slip of permission
I'm not the most vicious of villain
I'm nicking it just to make vanilla thrilling
I'm not into killing but if you were
Given the gift of intuition
Then keep me within your peripheral vision
'Cause I'm of a jittery disposition
I'm a nervous guy that prefers to hide
I'm terrible shy and I don't know why
So please do me the following courtesy
And never look me in the purple eyes
I'm averse to being observed at night
So if you see me you deserve to die

[Chorus 1: Dan Bull]
You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no... no!

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
I see you peeking at me through the glass in the door
What, chap, are you asking for more?
Boy, you're jibbering jabbering like an old
Man reminiscing of back in the war
I'm naturally, massively tall
I should be practising basket-ty ball
But I can't find a ball without corners at all
So I'm passing the time by unstacking your wall
If we pass in the hall, you're gon'afto ignore me
Perhaps you should look at the grass on the floor
Grab a map and explore the various biomes
But be aware this is my home
I roam through the night alone
Hoping to find someone I can bone
But I'm out of sight and mind and time
Like a rotary dial phone
I don't want to die alone
My type of solo's a xylophone

[Chorus 2: Dan Bull]
You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no... Rockit!

[Chorus 3: Rockit]
You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
You don't want to mess with the endermen
No, no, no, no, no...

[Bridge: Rockit]
Don't look me in the eye, you better run and hide
I'm chasing after you until you die
Deadly as a knife, beautifully designed
I'm hunting you tonight until you die
It's time to tell the truth, a bomb you can't defuse
So easily amused to watch you die
Don't you try to fight, you're lucky you're alive
I have you in my sights... no, no, no, no

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
Now you see me, now you don't
Shoving a dirt block down your throat
You better not be getting out your boat
I suggest that you don't leave the house alone
Oh, no, I'm on a mission
To win this staring competition
I'll let you live on just one condition
If you put a pumpkin upon, you're forgiven
No, no, no, no
