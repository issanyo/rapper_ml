[Intro]
This is a hold-up !
Ten Million

[Verse 1]
I've got a Double Daryl shotgun, pointed at your bottom
Now hand over the Diamond Play Button
'Cuz his facemask's stainless steel
It's attached to his face like a grapefruit peel
Dat face reveal's gonna make 'em squeal
But when's it gonna be ?
Patient, we'll need to negociate a deal
Then maybe we'll see about making it real
He's a mystical being from space
Even his family hasn't seen his face
And I know I shouldn't tell you this, he'll be fumin'
But he looks just like a typical human
And assuming you didn't figure it out already
HE REALLY LOVES HIS TEDDY
When he doesn't get a hug he becomes unsteady
Vomit on his sweater, mom's spaghetti
You're getting soaked no stopping the leak
Like a toddler reluctant to sleep
Acting as if he's got nothing to eat
But he's one of the top, the elite
I got as many views in my career
As Delirious has just got in a week
You better shuch up when I drop on the beat
Because even though he can't properly speak
He will climb greatness mountain and then grab
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak
He can play Gmod Hide and Seek
With Vanoss then switch up to Hide and Shriek
Everyday's Friday the Thirteenth, so
Check your sub box first thing, oh
He plus Gmod are peas in a pea pod
Try and stop him and there'll be a season of Jihad
Fighting over who might be the supreme god
They've both never been seen, does it seem odd ?
The Delirious family knows
We're unlike the average joes
Or Mannequin hoes
The insanity shows
No wonder mom and dad are panicking loads
Your'e damned if you do and you're damned if you don't
So strap on the mask and gooooo

[Chorus]
The moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak

Oh, the moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak

[Verse 2]
Why so serious, why so blue ?
Ain't H2O Delirious right fo' you ?
Why ? What lenghts could a guy go to
To provide your amusement, acquire those views
In Vinewood driving a Rhino through
Find Shia LeBeouf and call him Shilo Boof
Ahem, that was a typo, oops
No need to correct me you snide lil' douche
Everyone's a critic, the line's so true
When you get what creators online go through
"You're so useless and I'm so cool"
I can hit a low and a high note too
'Scuse me but do I know you ?
Telling me to die, bro, why don't you
SHUCH UP !
You're in serious need of a
TOUCH UP !
I don't meen make up, I mean getting
ROUGHED UP !
SHUCH UP !
If you found that offensive well then
You should have heard what I took out the
ROUGH CUT !
SHUCH UP !
If you don't, I've a prediction
SHUCH UP !
You'll become a survivor victim
SHUCH UP !
Just SHUCH UP ! SHUCH UP ! SHUCH UP !
Just SHUCH UP ! SHUCH UP ! SHUCH UP !
Just SHUCH UP !
Or I'll introduce my foot to your buttocks

[Chorus]
The moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak

[Verse 3]
Boat wrecker, dope peddlar, vogue setter
Go getter, joke teller, so clever
Wana make a video better ?
No pressure
Lol joke the heat's overloading your processor
You're a flat pack hat rack, he's an oak dresser
Don't imitate, come up with your own method
Or even better, just don't ever
Pimpin' out the lo lo with chrome leather
Taking over the show at his own leisure
While I study flows like a professor
We dunno whether dinos had no feathers
But we do know the zero's supposed to be a letter
It's totally an "O" not a number
This is a Courgette, this is a Cucumber
Known as zuchini
Oh 'scuse me, but I'm from overseas, so sue me
Goody two shoes and a blue hoody
Bloody shoes would he choose to be you buddy ? Who ?
True that he's too good he needs to be studied
To discover the gene making movies funny
Ten million subs that'll see YouTube
Then be "Please mummy, we need food"
How can I say this without seeming rude ?
Pff, screw it, you're a penis dude !

[Chorus]
The moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak

[Verse 4]
Lemme begin a rap that's incredibly fast
See me get in and then vanish quicker
Than the fidget spinner fad
MiniLadd's getting really mad, checking the minimap
Like the fella was in Trinidad with a myriad
Of chickens when he meant to be in Chiliad, silly chap
Will he actually get'em back and intact, or be
Picking up a bit of litter and sticking it in a bag
With a death date written on the tag
I know true, it's a sucky task
But somebody's gotta do it so go fetch the hockey mask
That costume's Delirious, don't copy that
Hitting with the impact of a shotty blast
He needs food to bloat up his body mass
And make a meal montage with a Rocky track
One second, he's a fully jolly chap
And the next he's a bloody stroppy twat
And if you haven't ever heard of Batcoon
He's a badass, crime-fighting racoon
Kicking every villain's ass to this rap tune
'Til it make an excuse to leave, and soon
Delirious rhymes with :
Curious, Furious, Spurious and Devine Mysterious Experience
So get down on your knees and beg
With a prayer to the white circle easter egg

[Chorus]
The moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak

Oh, the moon tide is tugging on my heart strings
This chorus should sound so much better but I can't sing
So instead of singing melodies
I just sort of rythmically speak
About climbing greatness mountain and grabbing
Greatness's tits at the top of the peak
