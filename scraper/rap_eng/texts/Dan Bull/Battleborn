[Verse 1]
What's Dan Bull doing?
Why ain't he rapping?
Cause I feel like it
Deal with it, bitch

[Chorus]
I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come just to rattle your bones
I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
Let's go grab the
Grab the, cattle by the horns
Roll like a stone, like a stone

[Verse 2]
You motherfuckers feel the fat fuzzy humbuckers
Drums pump you full of dumdums
You're dumbstruck
Flashing you out when we bunch up and bum rush
Swinging guns at you like they're fricking nunchucks
We're crude, lewd and rude
We leave you nude
In a puddle of blood
It's enough to make your mum blush
You've got a big gun?
Well I've got a bigger one
If you want to live another minute brother, better run
We could have been anything that we wanted to be
But all we wanted to be was this predominantly
Do nothing moderately
So don't be bothering me
Cause currently I'm swallowing a bottle of beam

[Chorus]
Born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
Let's go, grab the
Grab the cattle by the horns
Roll like a stone, like a stone

[Bridge]
Five fives is twenty five
That's twenty five motherfuckers want you dead or alive
Twenty five fives is a hundred twenty five
But a hundred twenty fives is two thousand five hundred

[Verse 3]
I'm in the place
Bombing the base
Running up with a gun in your face
Let me cut to the chase
I come at a pace
Similar to somebody running a race
Nothing'd faze me
My aim's keen
With a laser beam
To cut a long story short I'm crazy

[Chorus]
I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
I was born in the battle, in the battle was born
And now I've come back just to rattle your bones
Let's go, grab the
Grab the cattle by the horns
Roll like a stone, like a stone
