[Intro: Dan Bull & Beit Nun]
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go

[Verse 1: Beit Nun]
Yeah
Here we go
We had you waitin for this collaboration
Me and Dan been savin this moment
You know we've been doin tracks for ages
Before I was smashin stages with four-max
And before his album Safe before the music made his channel famous
We shared a passion for stayin' up late on cognac
And gettin lashed off our faces
And recommendin' each other songs we should add to our playlists
Nine years later, we've actually made this!
Welcome to Brandy Night, bring a bottle, let's have it right
Gather round, and lend us your ears as we pass the mic
Raw, nothin' is sacrificed, pure
Put here in black and white in a six course platter
Nourish your appetite, this is organic and home grown
Pick your own and then drink 'til you're in the zone
We're 'bout to school you in the art of writin'
You wanna recommend your friends to our stuff, but you can't describe it

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Beit Nun]
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
I'm Clark Kent, the microphone's my phone box
Soon as I step inside that booth, my fricking flow drops
Like a ton of bricks, my YouTube gets a ton of clicks
When it comes to my particular specific niche, I'm running shit

[Beit Nun]
Here we go
Bet you thought this would never come to fruition
But trust me, this was my number 1 mission
See, my book wasn't finished somethin was missin'
So this is more than just a little number to bump in your system

[Dan Bull]
It's Dan and Ben, the human form of pad and pen came through
Before we're back again, troubadors who rap intense
Imbue with awe, we're packing dense metaphors without pretense
If every story has an end, you better tell it then, tell 'em Ben

[Beit Nun]
Nah, not yet ready to close the chapter
No spoilers, not givin' anythin' away, mate, it's cloak and dagger
I'm the ghost of the manor, hip hop is dead
But I stay promotin' these rappers with stickers posters and banners

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Beit Nun]
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
I think the unthinkable, print the unprintable
Paint the invisible and sink the unsinkable, you imbecile
I'm a man with principles, I am invincible
And unequivocally inexplicably irresistable (hah)
Come and touch the bull, I'm untouchable
Not gonna budge at all I'll bust your balls, crushed with force
Giving them the consistency of that when lumpy custard pours
Fuck the bird's eye, I've got the bull's eye, adjust the scores
I spray the freshest tones although I'm made of flesh and bones
And though I may be lesser known than Drake or Jay-Z, let it go
I'm in a spot beyond comparison, but not just arrogant
I'm having fun while other rappers call a cab, I run the marathon
My Moses raps part the waves coast to coast
From Antarctica to the heart of any dart that you can throw at the map (hah)
You don't come close to being dope as that, you hopeless prat
I push the envelope like Postman Pat

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Beit Nun]
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
Here we go, here we go, here we go
