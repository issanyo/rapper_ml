[Verse 1]
Just master race things
Just master race things
Just master race things
You know just master race things
Oi Mate !
Check out my new rig
Nine thousand and two gig...
Of games
With more mods than a who gig
I read the jealousy written on your face
When I said I needed planning permission for my case
Your rig is a disgrace
It's a little but a raised
Middle finger up to Gaben and an insult to the race
Every console falls prey to the same fate
Blatant aliasing and a lame frame rate
Hey mate
I measure mine in planck time
Beat you to the singularity defining mankind
Ahead of the times
You wouldn't even believe
I pre-order a release before it's event conceived
I've got such a cutting edge chipset
That I can only play games that don't even exist yet

[Hook]
You console peasants have facts to face
Facts to face
Facts to face
You can't compare to that master race
The master race will faq your face

[Verse 2]
I'm just letting you know there's no letters as sexy
As WASD
I've got an 8TB SSD
You've got an IDE running XP
Forget 1080p, that's a baby screen
Anything less than 8K will make me scream
If there's ever a pixel that I can plainly see
It best be on a retro indie game release
A nice fact for you to wank about
There's more cash in my steam wallet than in my bank account
Kids stay in school
Never break rules
And make sure you pray every day to Gabe Newell

[Hook]
You console peasants have facts to face
Facts to face
Facts to face
You can't compare to that master race
The master race will faq your face

[Verse 3]
Just master race things
Just master race things
Just master race things
You know just master race things
Just master race things
Just master race things
Just master race things
You know just master race things
I'm pro nuclear power
Cause I can drain a whole power plant with my PSU in an hour
The hoover dam's water cooling my tower
My CPU needs something new to devour
While you fool around with your montain dew
My watercooler's the fountain of youth
I don't give a damn about the review
My PC'S a beast
It should be held in a zoo
GPU fans sounds as loud as the who
Producing heat that's even capable of melting a nuke
I tell thee, it's true
And if you doubt me we'll do
A stress test where I'll leave you running round in a loop
You're a console peasant
I'm a grumpy old pedant
In a adolescent brain on the credit of my parents
I had them pay for my setup as a present
Cause I said I needed better processing for my lessons
What I meant was FPS in league of legends
And the set on LED keys on my desk are iridescent
Do I ever have a little bit of emphaty ? NO !
My our framerates be high and our temperatures low !

[Hook]
You console peasants have facts to face
Facts to face
Facts to face
You can't compare to that master race
The master race will faq your face
