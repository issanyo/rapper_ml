[Verse 1, The Wellies]
Lovely day for it, how do you do?
And we just had to pay for it out of the truth
But who can remember? So who'd really care?
Exactly how all of the bodies got there
With a hop and a skip and the pop of a pill
We will all be forgiven for all that we've killed
And we've never been happier (And we've never been happier)
No we'll never be happier (No we'll never be happier)

[Welly:]
A brilliant day is dawning
A million smiles are forming
Our shimmering isles are all enthralled
No there’s nothing like conforming
Perish the thought of mourning
Did you ignore the warnings?
All negative thoughts abhorred

[Doctor:]
My Lord! Did you take your joy this morning?

[Welly:]
Ask anybody in Wellington Wells
They'll tell you it's terribly swell
Delirious denizens dwell where there's nary a speck between heaven and hell
They say that the empire fell

[Doctor:]
Oh, but you never could tell!

[Welly:]
You say you remember it well?

[Doctor:]
You'd better forget it or else!

[Welly:]
Why try to better yourself?
Reach for the medical shelf
Just take your medicine, death and the pestilence melt into pleasant locales
Another rebellion quelled
Dust off your suspenders and belts
It's horrendous to dwell so remember how splendid it felt to surrender yourself...

...The roses we grow have a terrible smell...

[Chorus, The Wellies]
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
To be among we happy few
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
It's a Joy

[Verse 2, Uncle Jack]
Well well, welcome to Wellington Wells
Hear the tintinnabulations of the resonant bells
As every resident tells you when they gush about our little town
No need to rush, hush, you're welcome to settle down
Better not let me down
You're not a downer are you?
Get off the bench and quell that frown right now, Keanu
Try not to make a scene, let's keep this place serene
Unless you want a cricket bat print in the place your face had been
Don't be concerned, that was just a little bitter lyric
The world in which you live is every little bit idyllic
Because if we even sniff discontent we're quick to kill it
Ahem, please forgive my sense of humour, I'm a wit; satiric
They call me Uncle Jack
I'm bringing jungle back
Dropping silver tongue twisting numbers on your mumble rap
Now be my guest and enjoy your day
And don’t forget to keep ingesting your joy all day

[Bridge, The Wellies]
Not a frown to be found in our haven from gloom
It's astounding what our medication can do
As our town's burning down in a rainbow of hues
Even the sky wouldn't dare to be blue

[Chorus, The Wellies]
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
To be among we happy few
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
It's a Joy

[Verse 3, Welly]
I've found a downer!

[Rolling Pin Welly:]
Hunt him down!

[Pan Welly:]
Surround the bounder!

[Bottle Welly:]
Drown him!

[Trowel Welly:]
Pound him into powder!

[Bobby:]
Then head down to the grounds for a round of rounders!
(Yay!)

[Welly:]
If you're caught in a rotten, improper mood
We'll stop at nothing to swaddled and coddle you
Throttle and bottle you, Bobby will cudgel you
Into the pond ‘til your body is otter food
Quarter you, jauntily torture you
Until you've thought all the thoughts that we order you
Sporting a jollier point of view
If you're not enjoying it what is the point of you?

[Doctor:]
We've just the thing to stop the rabble, It’s
Grin, pop some tablets
No matter what the matter is
Sins forgot. Fabulous
Cast off with the ardent misfits
Lamenting the garden districts
So throw your doses in the bin
History's made by those who grin

[Welly:]
The fact is you can't react not knowing what REDACTED
No need to grieve if you can't see diseases we've REDACTED
Happiness and truth, we simply view them through a lens, REDACTED

[Doctor:]
Life's a breeze when you can leave uneasy deeds REDACTED

(I'm happy.)
(I'm happy.)
(I'm happy!)

[Chorus, The Wellies]
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
It's a Joy(Happy!)
To be among we happy few(It's a Joy!)
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
To be among we happy few
It's a Joy
It's a Joy
And we've never been happier
No we've never been happier
