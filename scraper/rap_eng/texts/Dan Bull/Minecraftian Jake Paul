[Verse 1: iDubbbz]
I wanna be gamer 'cause you're fucked and I wanna savour it
But it's cool, after smashing you I'll PayPal you 2 diamonds
Oh, no! You getting mad?
Gonna knock the sword right outta my hand?
That shit was fucking absurd
You're a "miner" who can't resolve shit with ores?
Talk like you eating some steak, ayy
Is that your XP or your age? Ayy
Say to your audience's face, ayy
How a golden apple tastes
Ayy, you look afraid, must have seen an Enderman
Well, ditto, little bitch, but I'm not scared to show mine

[Verse 2: Boyinaband]
Boy, gotta mine
Gotta mine, mine, mine
Because when you've got no personality
Replace it with a pickaxe
You really don't see your friends rolling their eyes?
Hoping to die, they're so tired
Of you throwing the note blocks in their face
No no no no, you think they're gotta say

[Verse 3: iDubbbz]
Little hoe, little bitch
Suck my 5.3 inch pick
Admit that you just got pounded
I'd say "purpur" if you could pronounce it

[Verse 4: Boyinaband]
Whatever you promise to follow, you quit
You can't persist for shit, you narcissistic prick
Your audience is fickle, here's what I predict
Your house is bound to crash down to rubble (oh, no!)
How the fuck can someone called Gum
Not realize they're in the Nether?
But let me guess, I'm irrelevant, right?
Isn't that your excuse?
When you're too stupid to explain your views
'Cause you're as basic as a clay block Rubik's Cube
You're an insecure, unoriginal little bitch and that's that
So come to think of it
You're actually the Creeper filter on Snapchat

[Outro: iDubbbz]
Got cash, cash, money and the views and the clicks
And yet you're always gonna be a little bitch
