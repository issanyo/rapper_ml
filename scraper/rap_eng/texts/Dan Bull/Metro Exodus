[Verse 1]
They said Moscow was a lost hope
And it was, so i've gone off the beaten track
To meet a crossroad
East of Vladivostok
Under foot there is frozen blood in the snow
The rubble and bones
Are covered in mud
Under soot and the smoke
Is enough to choke you up
As you wander alone
Through tunnels and holes
And burrows and roads
Just looking for somewhere to go
That could become an abode
Even just a gutter's a comfortable home
But there's not much of a hope
There's no government
No more Russia
The globe's become a Chernobyl
A troublesome glow falls
A crimson snowball
Brings the Crow's call
In a minute you'll know
What i'm bringing this bow for
Killing isn't noble
It's no sport
But when i show force
I'm a stone wall
I'm immobile
Then i go forth
Like a blowtorch
To the snow, scorched
'Til it's no more
My skin is the colour of cobalt
Because i'm just so cold
But i'm
Always moving forward
Oh

[Hook]
Aurora
Aurora
You're our only refuge
Our only retreat
You're our only shelter
Aurora
When we've been beaten down
You're our Aurora

[Verse 2]
We're in a stalemate
The only way to play is stay away
Or jailbreak
The railway's a failsafe
Human frames make a frale freight
For a fatal tale
Fate'll tailgate
They'll chase
Making gains at a snail's pace
So say your grace
While you have a table place
At the fey buffet
Because the fables say
That the plates'll break
And you'll fade away
You may or may not make the grade
Without a place to stay
So praise the day
You stayed awake
To raise the stakes and say:
Mistakes were made
Lessons were learned
Allegiances, changes
And bridges were burned
Tapes and blades
And weapons were turned
To pieces
Upgraded
Respect isn't earned
It's taken
With a revolver trigger
Betrayed and sold up the Volga river
Vulgar rhythms
Rule, forgive them
In their shoes
You'd make the same cold decisions
I never wanted to become a killer
But it was them or me
I can only hope they're living on
In somebody's memory
Always moving forward
Oh

[Hook]
Aurora
Aurora
You're our only refuge
Our only retreat
You're our only shelter
Aurora
When we've been beaten down
You're our Aurora

[Verse 3]
Hiding out
A tiger primed to pounce
A Geiger counter by my side
A lighter by the belt
To try to find the lighter side of life
While i fight a mind of doubts
Enjoy the ride to hell
If i'm to die, you won't tie me down
When i go out i'm firing shells
Shouting "Life is swell"
No cry for help
I stoke the fire
Like a stoke prior scout

[Hook]
Aurora
Aurora
You're our only refuge
Our only retreat
You're our only shelter
Aurora
When we've been beaten down
You're our Aurora
