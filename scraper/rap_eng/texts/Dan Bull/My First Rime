[Instrumental]

[Intro]
It's
It's
It's like I'm
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm here

[Verse 1]
My ship was wrecked
I hit the deck
And then I woke in a utopia of picturesqueness
Limp and breathless
But getting restless
I think events like this are sent to test us
The unplanned, the unreal, the unknown
The unsure, the unseen, the unshown
The uncanny that you cannot understand
Because it's unfathomably unimaginably unraveling
You're unconscious, unrolling, uncovering
The unspoiled and uncommon it's unfolding
You cannot undo it
But everything you undergo you're going to come through it
Through time and season released on an island retreat
With nothing but rhyme and reason
Shrines, idols and carved figurines
Will be debris when I give up what I believe in

[Chorus]
As the sun goes down the moon comes out
And the same landscape seems new somehow
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme
As the sun goes down the moon comes out
And the same landscape seems new somehow
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme

[Verse 2]
I'm shipwrecked upon an island
Silent but for the echoes of a siren
It's wild what the perspective and the light does
My heads spinning it's really messing my mind up
Got to do something positive, so I'm running reconnaissance
Discovering phenomena beyond my cognisance
Ominous monoliths, not the commonest obelisks
Survive through time like honest promises and rise prominent
My hypothesis divine providence
Can I climb up to the summit, when I'm confident
To move free
Like the sand between my toes
Or the way that the wind blows
More power to me I wonder how it would be
To run around between the towers and the sea
Where the birds and the bees and the flowers and the trees
And the great beasts lived in peace
Aston fields

[Chorus]
As the sun goes down the moon comes out
And the same landscape seems new somehow
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme
As the sun goes down the moon comes out
And the same landscape seems new somehow
It's like I'm seeing for the first time
It's like I'm hearing my first rhyme

[Outro]
First time (first time, time)
First rhyme (first rhyme)
First time (first time, time)
First rhyme (first rhyme)
