Call it parkour but hardcore
I make killing an art form
Death's cold taste
Sweet as carte d'or
No need to start wars
For a difference of opinion
Give me the name of your antagonist
I'll stick them in the ribs
Because I'm an assassin
One with a passion
For innovative rapping
Dropping so fast
You're probably having
A problem to follow the captions
I'm so ahead of my time I'm probably rapping backwards
A scholar of Latin
With a master's in dispatching
Anybody that's hassling
One of my customers
I cuts them up
And shuts them up
In a casket
What you've got to do is ask
And then I'll have grabbed them
And then stabbed them
In the abdomen that minute
And be finished with the killing
Before you've finished with asking!
A bird of prey
With terminator's murder rate
I'm serving plates of pain up
Like a perverse buffet

I'll take you to the pearly gates
I'll impersonate a passer-by;
You wouldn't bat an eye
Until your circulations pacified
So practiced I couldn't
Count the crimes
I've perpetrated
How many spines
Or vertebrates
I've snapped
My raps travel through sound and time
Reverberate
Through generations
Permeate
My serenade regurgitated
Through a nerd rapper's recitation
To your earthly playlist

So I'd say this was a revelation
A revelation
