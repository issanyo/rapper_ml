[Intro]
A
Ruined world
Hey
What you doing girl?
Looking for answers?
You look a bit anxious

[Verse 1]
You're far from shelter
(Careful)
It's harmful out there
Fighting violence and terror
Is trial and error
Grab a vine or a fibre
A wire and tie them together
So you're flying
As light as a feather
Climbing whatever
Climate or weather
'Til you're finding the treasure
Head straight to Meridian
What a place to create a city in
Chasing Elysium
Like an idiot taking the lithium
Aim for oblivion
I may be rephrasing an idiom
Saying the same thing again
Just to make it fit in
But i'm taking you primitive places
You may never visit
And making it...
SSSIIZZLING

[Hook]
Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn
Got a premonition and I fear those swarms
Will be here with no warning
Hear those horns
Don't pour scorn
On those that forewarn
Of snowstorms
Or you could go home forlorn
Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn

[Verse 2]
Trudging through the over growth
The hunt's a drug i do
I'm floating close to overdose
My toes, my bones, my chromosomes
The moment's over, focus
Slowly sober, roaming over zones
Showing signs of tribes of old
Like roman roads are
Eroded
A ronin rode a rodeo
Rewrote the rule, we rowed a rowboat
Over rows of rapid river flows
Until it froze
The tiller throws us
And it goes off
'Til our goal just isn't close
This isn't supposed to be
The way the wind it blows
But when it blows, It leaves a breeze
That tends to throw the leaves of trees
To the extent we only see
In fevered dreams
See, believe
These machines
Steel beasts
When we beat them we'll feast
On meals of real meat again
We'll meet again
When he's deceased

[Hook]
Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn
Got a premonition and I fear those swarms
Will be here with no warning
Hear those horns
Don't pour scorn
On those that forewarn
Of snowstorms
Or you could go home forlorn
Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn

[Verse 3]
I've
Got something to say
Don't take it in a sensitive way
There's no sense in taking offense
I'm saving a friend when i say
Pray
What kind of brave hunter is chased
Running away
To the hub of the cave
Thinking you're going to be safe
Nah
They're coming to take
Everything you're loving away
Whether humble or great
Man, it'll crumble and fade
Succumbing unto the grave
So come on under whether you're
Pulling a gun or a blade
Going to make the blood in my veins
Run at a pace that's unsafe
In an untamed rugged domain
What could it mean
I'm wondering who my mother could be
Was she
The same kind of woman as me
There's some kind of beast
Drumming a beat
I'm a machine
Like those steel beasts
When we beat them we'll feast
On meals of real meat again
We'll meet again when he's deceased
When he's been blessed with death
When east is east
And west is west
North is north
And south is south
I'm going in
Out and out

[Hook]
Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn
Got a premonition and I fear those swarms
Will be here with no warning
Hear those horns
Don't pour scorn
On those that forewarn
Of snowstorms
Or you could go home forlorn
Every minute there's a hero born
At the beginning of the Zero Dawn
