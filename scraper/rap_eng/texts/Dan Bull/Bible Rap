[Boyinaband]
Dan will be a snake by the roadside
A viper along the path
That bites the horse's heels
So that its rider tumbles back
A flame goes forth from his mouth

[Dan Bull]
You will be completely wiped out (No!)

I will bring evil upon you
Out of your own house
I killed you with the words of my mouth
Chased you like a swarm of bees
And beat you down
Your bodies will lie there
Rotting on the ground

Your blood will be poured out
Into the dust
Full of every kind of wickedness
Will also bring on you every kind of sickness

[Boyinaband]
Kill men and women
Children and infants

[Dan Bull]
Break them with a rod of iron (Iron)
Emotions take over
Lashing out and spitting fire
Murdered a man and seized his property
Dash them to pieces like pottery

[Boyinaband]
Yeah, Bull will not be held responsible
Treated our sister like a prostitute

[Dan Bull]
What's the use of living a righteous life?
How will it benefit me?

[Boyinaband]
What's the use of living a righteous life?
How will it benefit me?

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Boyinaband]
The streets echo the cries
Violence! Rape!
Victims bleeding and moaning
Lie all over the place
The streets echo the cries
Violence! Rape!
Like a lion in cover he lies in wait

[Boyinaband]
I used a donkey's jawbone
To kill a thousand men
I beat them with this jawbone
Over and over again
Even if you beat fools half to death
You still can't beat
Their foolishness out of them

[Dan Bull]
For David had said to him

[Boyinaband]
"Your blood be on your own head
Your own mouth testified against you when you said"

[Dan Bull]
He catches the helpless
And drags them off in his net
He even destroyed
Distant relatives and friends

[Boyinaband]
Give yourself no relief
Your eyes no rest (No rest)
They are guilty of a capital offence
I will fill your mountains with the dead
Like a maniac shooting
Flaming arrows of death

[Dan Bull]
Is this the man who shook the Earth
And made kingdoms tremble
Lying there dead
With a tent peg through his temple?
When they saw the man
Fled from him and were dreadfully afraid
Before them the people writhe in pain

[Boyinaband]
All faces are drained of color
Like a stillborn infant
Coming from its mother's womb
With its flesh half eaten away
Hearts melt in horror
And knees shake

[Dan Bull]
Have no mercy on helpless babies

[Boyinaband]
Every time I open my mouth
I'm shouting "Murder!" or "Rape!"
It will be a terrible day
Sin!

[Dan Bull]
Greed!

[Boyinaband]
Hate!

[Dan Bull]
Killing even your brothers
Friends and neighbors

[Boyinaband]
They will writhe
Like a woman in labor

[Dan Bull & Boyinaband]
And if they give birth
I will slaughter their beloved children
Bringing a sudden flow of
Blood and water

[Boyinaband]
And even if your children do survive to grow up

[Dan Bull]
I will take them from ya

[Chorus]
The streets echo the cries
Violence! Rape!
Victims bleeding and moaning
Lie all over the place
The streets echo the cries
Violence! Rape!
Like a lion in cover he lies in wait


[Dan Bull]
Happy shall he be that takes
And dashes your little ones
Against the stones

[Boyinaband]
Fill its courtyards
With the bodies of those you kill, go!

[Dan Bull]
Will it keep begging you for mercy?
Will it? (Mercy!)

[Boyinaband]
I grab it by the throat
And kill it

[Dan Bull]
Kill all the boys and all the women
Who have slept with a man (Ew)

[Boyinaband]
Chop them up like
Meat for the pan

[Dan Bull]
Tore forty two of the children to pieces
Like flesh for the pot

[Boyinaband]
Throw them away
Like a menstrual cloth

[Dan Bull]
Make their flesh rot
And their eyes fall
From their sockets

[Boyinaband]
And their tongues drop out
Drink, get drunk and vomit

[Dan Bull]
Come, let us face each other in battle

[Boyinaband]
Release wild animals
That will kill your children
And destroy your cattle

[Dan Bull]
Anyone who is captured
Will be run through with a sword

[Boyinaband]
Their homes will be sacked
And their wives raped
By the attacking hordes

[Dan Bull]
Happy shall he be that takes
And dashes your little ones against the stones

[Boyinaband]
Fill its courtyards
With the bodies of those you kill
Go!

[Chorus]
The streets echo the cries
Violence! Rape!
Victims bleeding and moaning
Lie all over the place
The streets echo the cries
Violence! Rape!
Like a lion in cover he lies in wait
