[Chorus]
Hugh let the dogs out
Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh
Hugh let the dogs out
Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh

[Verse]
I believe Hugh Grant's gonna need new pants
'Cause his manhood's just been renewed
Wangling his way to a sweet news angle
You probably won't see on these news channels
News International's view's incompatible
With that of all of you who value truth over capital
Now I'm not saying Rupert's an animal
Hey, perhaps as a human he's affable
But Fair & Balanced, dude, that is laughable
Even calling it news is irrational
See, to them I'd be viewed as a radical
And for that, I ought to be stewed in a casserole
Pappers and tappers are just a new sort of cannibal
Using other people as food for their bankroll
So the fact that Hugh's done it back
Is amusing to me to the maxicles

[Chorus]
Hugh let the dogs out
Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh
Hugh let the dogs out
Hugh, Hugh, Hugh, Hugh

[Outro]
Murdoch is nothing if he can't tap a phone
Murdoch will tap your phone
Murdoch will allegedly tap your phone
Murdoch is nothing if he can't tap a phone
Hugh, mate
I wanna buy you a drink
I'll even pay off the [? 1:09] you forgot the other day
Lolz
