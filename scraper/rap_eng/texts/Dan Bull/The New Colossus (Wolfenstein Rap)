[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
Have you ever been so hung over
That you don't know whether you just woke from a coma?
But you're teetotal
You're totally sober
So it's gotta be your body's bones that are broken
A global explosion
A tyrannical virus
Nearly as bad as writing in comic sans
And papyrus
Luckily there's something that we can prescribe
It's a man that'll fight
To dismantle the Reich
Blond haired, blue eyed
But he doesn't subscribe
To the doctrine that it makes him higher than another guy
He doesn't like taking credit without merit
He's ready to demonstrate it
To anyone that doesn't get it
He brought a big bag of bloody guns to the party
'Cause what's the point in just punching a nazi?
Never mind a sucker punch
Off someone you can't see
I'll bring a tank to the demolition derby
Leaving nothing but a bit of charred meat
In the car seat
Can't be doing with that parlay malarkey
Says "shoot first, ask questions never"
"to anyone claiming to be the best, I'm better"
Meet BJ Blazkowicz
A one man natural disaster risk
He's hurting to hurt
And he'll scratch that itch
By tracking down a nazi
To blast to bits
No small prints, caveats or asterisks
Won't bow to the master
That cracks the whip
He'll be standing on the back
Of the basilisk
And hacking at its scalp
With a bloody battered fist
Takes pain like a masochist
But he'll never self inflict
Never slash his wrist
The only manner in which he'll ever go down's
Whenever he throws down
With the last nazi bitch

[Chorus: Machinae Supremacy]
The best you got?
Your best won't do
Now you are the weak
And this is your doom
You are among wolves now
And these
Are our woods, our howls, and our feast
There when the smoke clears
And the flames
And all's laid to waste
One man remains
Frau, can you feel it, can you see?
No army left
It's just you and me

[Verse 2]
Imagine being accused of as subhuman
Because you are another hue
From the dude who is ruling
Imagine overnight losing all you loved ones
No goodbyes, no hugs they're just gone
Imagine the sixties without love and peace
A big apple with jackboots out on the streets
Imagine America controlled by a despot
Turning everything he holds to a cesspit
Death to the death's head moth
The totenkopf
We won't stop 'til it's totally broken off
Throw hands with the oberkommando
Chuck a bone at the panzerhund
Hand over
Power to the people and allow them to be equal
Well at least 'til they announce another sequel
But for now we'll assist the resistance
In opposition to a system
Insisting we're ripped from existence
Frau Engel
A frown on her brow
That'll make a man tremble
Break a man's mettle like the end of a pencil
Pressed on a page and proclaiming your death
Your witness
To a harsh harsh mistress
But BJ'll get the last laugh yet
Yes
Get the cat to chase the mouse
Set the trap, eradicate the Frau
Where's the master race now
And what is a new colossus
When they want to nuke the lot of us?
This is the start of an insurrection
Giving protection from unhinged infection
But we ditch the syringe and medicine
For a big metal thing that lead is in
So let us in
Most of us have never been beheaded
Let alone at the Lincoln thing and on the telly
'Tis but a scratch, an itch
Who dares to spill the blood of Blazkowicz
A last ditch attempt to tempt fate and escape
But it's too late for that you nazi bitch

[Chorus: Machinae Supremacy]
The best you got?
Your best won't do
Now you are the weak
And this is your doom
You are among wolves now
And these
Are our woods, our howls, and our feast
There, when the smoke clears
And the flames
And all's laid to waste
One man remains
Frau, can you feel it, can you see?
No army left
It's just you and me
