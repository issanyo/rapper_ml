[Chorus: Cammie]
I don't read between the lines
Cause I can always turn back time
Mistakes are something I don't make
And I know that life is strange
But I'll never be the same

[Verse 1: Dan]
I am a girl with all the time in the world
Got time on my hands and time's on my side
Ahead of my time having the time of my life
But it's time for a change, time to rewind
Time for another plan, time to decide
And if I can rewind then I can read minds
Pulling together these pieces of time
Pull the hands back, take another path, another chance
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans
Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans

[Chorus: Cammie]
I don't read between the lines
Cause I can always turn back time
Mistakes are something I don't make
And I know that life is strange
But I'll never be the same

[Verse 2: Dan]
Each photograph I take is a broken little token of a moment and a place
Another snapshot backed up on the laptop
I gather evidence against Blackwell lapdogs
This is for Kate Marsh
The way they baited her is way harsh
Why must they take time to break hearts
When all we want to do is stay aside, make art?
Arrange parts of time into a straight path
Time to pay your dealer and time's a great healer
I might faint from this time bomb
Hey Veela
My cerebral cortex is spinning a vortex
Clubs you're not invited to and things you never saw yet
I need a time out right now
I need to breathe back those hurtful words into my mouth
But as I wipe the blood from my nose I know that my time's up, another moment... froze
It's high time we had an everyday hero
In the right place at the right time, here, oh
I guess I've got time for one more line
So Cammie run that by me one more time

[Chorus: Cammie]
I don't read between the lines
Cause I can always turn back time
Mistakes are something I don't make
And I know that life is strange
But I'll never be the same
