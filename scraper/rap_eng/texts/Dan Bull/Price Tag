[Intro]
I don't think so mun- did... budget
I don't think much of Osborne's new budget
I don't think... uhm, can't say it

[Verse 1]
I know we don't have many golden nuggets but still
You've buggered up the budget and will
Cause old people to snuff it, their heating bill
Too high and they're dying 'cause they need their pills
And not knowing if you'll live until tomorrow
Is a bitter pill to swallow
The promises that you've fulfilled are hollow
Why are the poor, young, old and the needy
Repaying the bills that the greedy have borrowed?

Whether you lean to the left, or
Whether you lean to the right, I
Believe we can all agree that something's not quite right

[Chorus 1]
I've got a feeling in my tummy tummy tummy
That there's people going hungry unneededly
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names
And
I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names, 'cause
While there's people shouting mayday, their
Bloody Bankers think it's payday

[Verse 2]
Hey
No admission from the coalition, no contrition
The decisions that they've laid out have made Great Britain different
The change they've saved is a pittance
In the face of the waste that's ingrained in the system
The way that they're shitting on us, taking the piss
It is as if there is a plague in the cistern, it's sickening
While we sit in front of Strictly
They're finishing us fiscally with strychnine

Do you think the children of Milton Keynes give a fuck
Whether you follow Milton or Keynes' economics?
Still you cleaned everybody's wallet out
So we're asking for the cash back, we want it now

[Chorus 2]
I'm not trying to be funny funny funny
I'm just worried about money money money
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names
And
I'm not trying to be funny funny funny
I'm just worried about money money money
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names

[Verse 3]
Mr. Cameron reckons we're in it together
Yeah, except the ministers with cheddar and the sinners in the City
Sometimes I like to try and show off writing really cleverly
So apologies for the following extended silly simile:
The rioters'll never be as quiet as a feather
Freely flying through the heavens in the sky and gently settling
Upon the ground, sometimes I wander round
And wonder how my town could have become so bloody run down

You're giving us the runaround
Pushing some of us underground
I hear a thumping sound
But it's not a drum, it's crowds
Of British citizens who wish they'd never given you
The power that you now are using to give them the finger

[Chorus 3]
My usual disposition's sunny sunny sunny
But I'm worried about money money money
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names, 'cause
It's been shown by many studies studies studies
You need an investment of public money money
To encourage spending and thus induce
Confidence in the market, an economic boost

[Verse 4]
Actually you could snatch a leaf from Clement Attlee
He did the opposite of you and it happened fantastically
We narrowly escaped catastrophe
'til Mrs. Thatcher undid it dastardly
No amnesty on bankers' salaries
Putting the lad or lass that needs it at last and least
That's not the path that leads to everlasting peace
So cut it out and bring back the beat

[Chorus 4]
I'm not trying to be funny funny funny
I'm just worried about money money money
Now I don't want to play the blame game, but
If I have to I will name names, 'cause
It's like a game of rugby rugby
The more you try the more that you get muddy muddy
It's like a game of rugby
The more you try the more you get covered in shit

[Outro]
Oh, the more you try
The more you try
The more you get covered in shit

Power to the people!
