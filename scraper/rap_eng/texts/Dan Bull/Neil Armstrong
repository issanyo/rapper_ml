[Verse 1]
I'm Neil Armstrong
I've got my garms on
Far-reaching as if each arms long
Planet Earth
Man, it's dead in this place
I look down on every race
When I'm in space
VIP invitation
So you can't come along
It's just me, Buzz
And that other one
We get in Apollo 11
And head to the heavens
In terms of transport
It's an irregular method
And telecoms are expensive
We haven't got a landline
That's one giant phone bill
For man kind

[Chorus]
Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon
I said, who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon

[Verse 2]
To all you faker haters:
I'd like to take away
The doubts you've got
Until you drop them
Like the hottest bake potato
Screw the rumors
That the moon is made of cheese
Or the whole space race campaign
Is make believe
Claiming there's no way
That we could have planned it
We could be leaving the planet
Without it leaving us stranded
So let me be blunt and candid
You eejits' are mad
And ain't even speaking my language
You're just mean and pedantic
Claiming that we were pretending
But I ain't even offended
So face it, space dick:
"The Eagle has landed"

[Chorus]
Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon
I said, Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon
Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon
I said, Who produces the bangin'est tunes?
It's Neil Armstrong
The man in the moon
