[Shizzy VI]
Warrior filled with metal gears
Walking the size of a Metal Gear
Refer to me as Raiden
Feel the wrath of my blade and view my metal gear
Slick as a Gray Fox, with the telekinetic ability of a Psycho Mantis With the moves of an Ocelot
I’mma show the whole world what my plan is
Domination – that’s day by day
In a Metal Gear Rex or a Metal Gear Ray
Launching a rocket, predicting your moves
Plug into a whole new socket
Why? ‘Cause I’m watching, I’ll sever your arms
While reading the data on your memory card
You’re never as hard, I’m solid like Plissken
When rhyming my mission, snipe from the distance
A lyrical depiction of greatness
A Son of Liberty with guns of the Patriots
On a substance where I need water
Or I’ll trip out and won’t be a Peace Walker
King Cobra, snake eater
When I start rising, I’ll blaze speakers
Til the day that Sixx is a massive name
Making rappers go ghost, bringing phantoms pain
A master swordsman that you can’t handle
Solid Shizzy with Liquid Dan Bull
You spit sick gamble, lose your profits
You’ll be crying wolf with no way to stop it
I’m a Big Boss, turning artists purple
Bringing all the sorrow, best call the Colonel
Raw for sure, yo! You ain’t on my level
Hence why I possess your woman like Meryl
Never gonna settle, I’m never gonna be suffering
Waving a finger right at the government
Weapons at the ready from my heads to my socks
Like Snake’s trademark, I’ll put you in a box
Snake
Snake

[Dan Bull]
Sneaking around, not a peep or a sound
From my feet on the ground, but if people have found
Me then I down these with a leap
And a bound, then leave like a thief in a crowd
I’m the lead lethal elite
Look at me, can you see the physique? Sweet
I need it for griefing and breaching the peace
When I’m breaching a keep, but I keep it discrete
You will see what I mean when I creep knee-deep
In the evil and leave with not even a squeak
To me, people seem inane
And when they see my name it doesn’t mean the same thing
Me? I’ve got the meanest aim, think
I was a Green Beret, I never squeeze and pray
You better leave in haste, believe you may
Never see the day or breathe again
A snake in the grass
I lay awake in your path
And they are making a massive mistake if they ask it
I’ve faith in the task – their face
I’m taking it fast, and breaking
It past the point their next of kin could name it from snaps
You’re not up to the skilled task
Your style’s like me, it gets old real fast
Genetically modified, what a guy
So I often wonder why I have only got one eye
I’m a clone, so I’m not alone
Grown in a test tube, I’m the best dude that I know
I’m a son of Big Boss, but I don’t give a toss
Because I’m a bigger boss, pick a sod and flip them off
I’m a raw dude, cutting all through you waves
Like the blade of a sawtooth through a raw fruit
But call me Snake Plissken and you’re risking
A major plagiaristic lawsuit
