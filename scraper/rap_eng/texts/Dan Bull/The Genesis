I'm not threatening you mate. It's beyond fucking words. I watched over you when you were asleep and I looked at your fucking neck and I was that far away from slicing it. You're fucking there mate! So get in that car... and fuck off

[Dan]
Hello David

[Dave]
Hello, how are you, Dan?

[Dan]
I'm okay. Um, I'm just recording the intro track to my mixtape "Bullmatic", which is a cover mixtape of, uh, Nas' Illmatic. And the first track is basically him talking to this friend. Um, and you're my friend so I thought I'd call you on Skype and talk to you

[Dave]
Okay. Is this it? Are we recording it now?

[Dan]
Yeah, this is it

[Dave]
Oh

[Dan]
And, um, let me see, we've got- we've got a little while longer before track 2 kicks in so... I dunno. Um, I don't- I don't- like in the original version I don't really know what they're talking about so, I guess we could talk about anything

[Dave]
Um, you thirsty?

[Dan]
I- I'm fairly thirsty

[Dave]
(chuckles) You want a cup of coffee, or something?

[Dan]
Um, yeah. After I've recorded this, I'll go and put the kettle on, and um... I mean, obviously the people listening will go on and listen to track 2 but we can have a chat while they're listening to track 2

[Dave]
Alright

[Dan]
See ya

[Dave]
Bye

[Dan]
Ok, this is Bullmatic
