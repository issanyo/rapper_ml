[Intro]

[Verse 1: JT Music]
I'm in the big pond, feel like a small trout
Coming from the underground, with that vault clout
Sorry everybody else who was locked out
While the bombshells were dropped, we just got down
Walkin’ taller than a monster Mega Sloth now
Fly like a Mothman, knockin' Deathclaws out
Said that I was S.P.E.C.I.A.L - Yes I'll make my mom and pop proud
Ain’t the weather wonderful? I love it when it's Fall out
I'm ready for the reclamation
25 years, you bet I've been patient
76's representative pennin' the next declaration
Tricentennial celebration in the wasteland that I call my nation
No sweat when I get radiation
Forget Chems, embrace Mutation
You ain't gonna find a white picket fence
Better to set up a line of defence
Try to get by, you might end up dead
No wonder why they said "Try makin' friends"
Good thing I found me some pals I can roll with
And take a stroll on the open country road with
(Let’s go!)

[Chorus]
You got to walk when the wind says walk
You got to run when the gun says hi
You got nothin’ and no one to turn to now
And 76 Reasons to die
And we go
One step, two step, guns to the sky
Pocket those caps and wipe that knife
Three step, four step, never ask why
76 Reasons to die

[Verse 2: Gameboy Jones]
It's been a minute, let me step up out this Vault, boy
Imma keep on livin’, wanna see all my assault toys?
Everybody's timid so I come through with a loud noise
Always got a stout poise but crew's a bunch a wild boys
Bullets be spinnin' and they rippin’ through flesh
And it's hotter than cinnamon, god, do you feel the adrenaline?
Me and my squad just be rollin' so militant
Take on the mission to finish it
Ain't cuttin' no slack, I'm stackin' my caps
Get hit with the V.A.T.S, I level to max
Ain't nobody gonna get better than that
Now I got 76 problems cause I live in an apocalypse
Most of them are solved when I go take the shooter off my hip
Come up to my settlement, you'll see just what I'm all 'bout
'Bout to drop a bomb, now that is what you call a fallout

[Chorus]
You got to walk when the wind says walk
You got to run when the gun says hi
You got nothin' and no one to turn to now
And 76 Reasons to die
And we go
One step, two step, guns to the sky
Pocket those caps and wipe that knife
Three step, four step, never ask why
76 Reasons to die

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
Hmm, where to start? I best begin here (Where's that?)
West Virginia, mountainous dominion
Suddenly lookin' a little more Syrian
It's as if Cyrodil met Oblivion
A bit of heaven with decor that's hideous
And I bet I'm the busiest, silliest
Resident ever to trek through the hilliest
Pleasantest bit of American land
With a selection of weapons in hand
Steppin' up head to head with your gang
Ready to mess up whatever you've planned
I work hard to earn lots of perk cards
You jerk hard to burn off your butt lard
Now I'm projectin', amateur flexin'
Tryin' to account for my lack of progression
Damagin' reps of collabers I'm next to
Better not step to our direction
Oi, where all my people at?
I don't need to beat a rat
With a piece of rusty plumbing
I want runnin' NPCs on tap
What's happenin' to V.A.T.S?
I'm pressin' it but I can't get it to pause
There's Deathclaws at the door
Like Mormons born excessively jawed
What you threatenin' for?
You're definitely not protected by laws
But check any small print with caution
To prevent getting caught by the death clause

[Chorus]
You got to walk when the wind says walk
You got to run when the gun says hi
You got nothin' and no one to turn to now
And 76 Reasons to die
And we go
One step, two step, guns to the sky
Pocket those caps and wipe that knife
Three step, four step, never ask why
76 Reasons to die

[Verse 4: Fabvl]
Welcome to the wild I ain't talkin' 'bout the West
Crawl up out the vault into apocalyptic mess
Demons in the sky, you won't survive, it's not a test
Better learn to put a bullet through your neighbour's chest
Reason to die, don't even try, bleeding, I'm leavin' you, eaten alive
Freezin' and dry, Bloatfly, Roach, or Mutant, headin' the cry
It's you or I
Leavin' a legion of heathens beaten, seepin' and fried
Keep that rifle up and move it
Pip Boy loaded up, you know I'm lootin'
If I see a Brahmin, best believe that I'll be shootin'
Humans, petrified and cooked up like some cumin
Come and rebuild it, yea join the movement, sing it with me

[Chorus]
You got to walk when the wind says walk
You got to run when the gun says hi
You got nothin' and no one to turn to now
And 76 Reasons to die
And we go
One step, two step, guns to the sky
Pocket those caps and wipe that knife
Three step, four step, never ask why
76 Reasons to die

[Outro]
