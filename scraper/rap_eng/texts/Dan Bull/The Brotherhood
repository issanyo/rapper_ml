[Intro]
Brotherhood
Brotherhood
Brotherhood
Brotherhood

[Verse 1]
Dash back to the Renaissance
Like a racehorse
Mate I'll slash your face off
Make sure that I'll break your jaw
Like I break laws
Grateful that I gained the support of a new patron
Stationed in the papal states
But I take short breaks on days off
To take tours round Spain lakes or Naples
What, you wanna fight me?
Why didn't you say so?
What are you thinking that I'm bringing these blades for
Flush with the weaponry
Yep I've got a lot
Atop of your neck is a terracotta pot
You wanna watch, it's not going to topple off
Whoop, butterfingers
What a clot
Death comes sweet like I'm serving butterscotch
Let's turn this up a notch

[Chorus]
The brotherhood
Is our home
But it's understood
That when in Rome
We do as the Romans do
Appropriate their culture
And then use it to ruin you

(Use it to ruin you, ruin you)

[Verse 2]
Half animal, half cannonball
Fired out of the prow of a man of war
Without the sound of gunpowder pounding
Prowling around veiled in the crowd around me
I smell a heap of trouble
So I'm clambering the rubble
Then I'm running from an alley to a tunnel
Like I'm Sally Gunnell
My genes are a museum
Look within, see what I'm seeing
From columns to Colosseum
I'm one of these hitmen
Whose victim isn't gonna see 'em
As a policy I'm surreptitious
Polish anyone off becoming suspicious
Sophisticated enough to know
When I need to be thoroughly vicious
If I was you
I'd strap on a parachute
You never know who's dropping in
From out the blue
Have you heard the way
The biggest birds of prey
Can take a baby away like an invertebrate?
With a steel spine
I've the nerve to say
That I'm a spider
Now finish up your curds and whey

[Chorus]
The brotherhood
Is our home
But it's understood
That when in Rome
We do as the Romans do
Appropriate their culture
And then use it to ruin you

The brotherhood
Is our home
But it's understood
That when in Rome
We do as the Romans do
Appropriate their culture
And then use it to ruin you

[Outro]
(Use it to ruin you)
