[Intro]
Let's get to it, already!

[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
She's Tracer
Speed Racer
No need tryna even chase her
She could race and beat a laser beam
And make it seem a glacier
Competing's human nature
Do we need to do a wager
Place our chips down on the table
And make an accumulator
While me and you were wasting breaths on taking bets
Tracer was taking steps away
And now nothin' remains but steam and vapour
See you later
She says
Replays every second
Evading blades and every threat from any heavy weapon
Hella elegant in yellow pants
Upsetting fans
Outraged when they found out she's gay
As if they ever had a chance
Of gallivanting in the pants
Of an imaginary character
Even if she did exist
You wouldn't be her calibre
A woman becoming
Somethin other than bum and boobies
Still a cutie
Without moving her booty
See the inner beauty
You're thinking, "who's she?"
Ooh I'd like to date her
Sorry mate but she's taken
By the way, her name is Tracer

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Elsie Lovelace]
(I'm Tracer~)
We're feeling fine
Truly sublime
(Tracer~)
She realigns
The meaning of space
Light, speed and time (Hey~)
(Tracer~)
Read the signs
She moves at the speed of time
(Tracer~)
She recombines
The real and the fleeting
And leads the fight
(My name is Tracer~)
We're feeling fine
When we can shine
Without even trying
(Yeah~)
She redefines
The feeling of being alive
Tracer'll race in the place at a pace
That'll make you say you're seeing stuff
Blink and you'll miss her
Blink
Like your ping isn't in sync (Yeah~)
Cheers Luv'

[Verse 2: Dan Bull]
She cool
Human speedball
Recall
Move in freefall
Up and down temporally
The fleeting seat of a squeaky see-saw
You'll see when she floors it
Eagles and cheetahs seem as treacle
The laws of physics dictate
That she should be illegal
No equal, bigger than The Beatles
Gleefully beat all evil
One of these people you'll meet
Who'll leave you pleased
All peaceful
Cavalier
The cavalry's here
This rap could be a track of the year
Having a laugh and I'm crackin' a beer
While rapping as fast as Lena can appear
Don't think of smacking her rear
Or she'll attack and you'll lack a career
Then she's back in a flash
In the battle and battering
Happily chattering, "Cheers!"
Tracer'll race in the place at a pace
That'll make you say you're seeing stuff
Blink and you'll miss her blink
Like your ping isn't in sync
Cheers Luv'

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Elsie Lovelace]
(I'm Tracer~)
We're feeling fine
Truly sublime
(Tracer~)
She realigns
The meaning of space
Light, speed and time (Hey~)
(Tracer~)
Read the signs
She moves at the speed of time
(Tracer~)
She recombines
The real and the fleeting
And leads the fight
(My name is Tracer~)
We're feeling fine
When we can shine
Without even trying
(Yeah~)
She redefines
The feeling of being alive
Tracer'll race in the place at a pace
That'll make you say you're seeing stuff
Blink and you'll miss her
Blink
Like your ping isn't in sync (Yeah~)
Cheers Luv'

[Verse 3: Dan Bull]
Running's a remedy for the dilemma
She's under the spell of
Becomin' a memory
Funny that chemistry's nothing
But energy when a gorilla is cooking the recipe
Unacademically underdeveloped
But nevertheless a necessity
Never give up on a friend who is stuck
Or the second she does she's an enemy
Of everything that she does with fidelity
Tenderly does it for Emily
Then does it again til' you're humming the melody
Double the fun and it's double the jeopardy
What an incredible woman
If ever there was someone better
They wouldn't be quicker
Wouldn't be zipping and blinking
And bringing the fun
To the brink of the funk in a flicker

[Chorus: Dan Bull & Elsie Lovelace]
(I'm Tracer~)
We're feeling fine
Truly sublime
(Tracer~)
She realigns
The meaning of space
Light, speed and time (Hey~)
(Tracer~)
Read the signs
She moves at the speed of time
(Tracer~)
She recombines
The real and the fleeting
And leads the fight
(My name is Tracer~)
We're feeling fine
When we can shine
Without even trying
(Yeah~)
She redefines
The feeling of being alive
Tracer'll race in the place at a pace
That'll make you say you're seeing stuff
Blink and you'll miss her
Blink
Like your ping isn't in sync (Yeah~)
Cheers Luv'
