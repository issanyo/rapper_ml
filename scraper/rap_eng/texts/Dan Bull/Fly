[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
Smith, Stiffy, Skitch, McTwist into
A Kickflip, Liptrick, quick switcheroo
You kids get pissed if we missed a few
But we got a fricking big list of tricks to do
I'm like giving a nuke to Mr. Magoo
Hit the big red button, head butting
If you dispute
The only way i'll open my eyes to different views
Is when I'm owning the skies, 360 Degrees
Skatopia bred
Straight over your head
I can't skate, so I play it from my sofa instead
While you're wearing your Ray-Bans and getting a spray tan
The British are ripping up the American Wasteland
Dave and Dan are bringing the skill, singing at will
I'd give my kingdom for a H.O.R.S.E., call me King of the Hill
Rap's Richard the Third
Gap tricking with words
Ha!
Bringing a Flamingo that isn't a bird
Smack
Hitting the curb like my back wheel
But this isn't the certain Thug Life 2Pac feels
You won't be having your cap peeled
But I might crack a Melon, acapella
And prepare your last meal
A bit of Stalefish, you're not getting bailed prick
So get on your bike lest you get your little Tail Whipped
You failed to nail the trick
You've been derailed and made to pale into insignificance
You silly little-

[Hook]
I'm a Tony Hawk addict and I
Jump on my board grab it and fly
Fly (4x)
(2x)

[Verse 2 : Dave Brown]
First of all, I'd like to assure I'm all above board
But as gravity attests, I tend to break laws
That's legality suppressed when I Spacewalk
So I'm always entertained, I'll never skate bored
Half work, half play
That 50/50 grind
But there's two games at stake
And that's the rap and the skate kind
When I hear a hater say that it's only a game
"Revert to Manually skating"
What am I, a Caveman?
No way, fam!
So don't give me that Lip, Trick
When I flip out, jump up and grab you you'll zip quick
I'll hit with a Triple Kick, Flip you over, so
There's a high chance of a Spine Transfer while I bang this sick mix
I got them RSI rhymes
And if you disagree I'll be like "No, Comply"
While grinding pipes for sure brought nostalgia
If one more man misunderstands when I say Tony Hawk's Underground, I'll
Smack that Hipster and break his Indy Nosebone
Hit him so hard, I'll press his X chromosome
Then get air so high I'll bring back a boatload of ozone
And tell him what I told Newton: "just give up and go home!"
