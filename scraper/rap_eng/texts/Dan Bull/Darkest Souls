[Intro]
From the fire
Only embers
Remain

[Verse 1]
The last log's on the bonfire, we should go on, Sire
Things have gone dire, pray the church has got a strong spire
I'm not pious, though I know the gods have one desire
To purify via shrines with a song of fire
Prepare to enter a harmful world of embers
Of half-remembered curses darker than the worst December
Forget your Christmas card, return to sender
We never light yule logs, we burn dissenters
Hurt them and dismember
Any wretched urchin who is too determined to surrender
Curb their temper through the nerve endings to the nervous centre
I swing a broadsword at a Lord of Cinder
And swipe left and right quick as if I'm bored of Tinder
And all it takes is tinder to scorch a wall of timber
The more you try to hide the stink, the more it lingers
Like trauma, muscle memory, and sores on fingers
It'll sting more than sticking splinters in your sphincter
Mortal men prepare for an awful winter where
There'll be more claret spilled than an awkward Vintner's wares
You'll fall hard as if I've kicked you down a set of stairs
Into infinite despair, so enter if you dare

[Hook]
Chilled fingers each rely on a spark
To ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark
Stoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart
Smoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart
Chilled fingers each rely on a spark
To ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark
Stoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart
Smoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart

[Verse 2]
The land of Lothric is gothic
Frothing with toxic, hypnotic, chaotic
Catastrophic stuff
And all you've got to stop it's what's in your pocket
Accurately calibrated, rapping at a frantic pace
In language antiquated, chanting pages of the dankest phrases
Chained dance with a dancer's grace, yours is a damned disgrace
I balance chance and fate with a straight stance and gait
Don't aggravate, I'll amputate and lacerate or strangulate
'Til I decapitate and your atoms evaporate
Emancipate your plasma from its cells, I'll incapacitate
And stab your face 'til it's as see-through as a sheet of acetate
As a symbol of your sinful ways I hang you from a meat hook
I'm unkindled like they took away my eBook
Even the darkest souls
Are merely parts of a whole
Molten pieces cast in a mold
He who's dealing the cards never folds
Keep on the path to your goal
Unroll a scroll and leave them charred into coal
Or dissolved into mulch in a hole out in the cold
And with the whole of your self full of holes
Oh! How does he do that?
Always coming up with a new rap
At a speed that's truly too fast
While keeping it true to the boom bap, true that
I don't mean to brag
I'm just making up for what you lack
Pulling myself up by the bootstrap
Difficulty curves need a new graph
I cherish the chance
To perish, advance
Correcting errors and vanquish terrors
That dance in embers at camps
Ephemeral phantoms vanish as I replenish my flask
Remember the past, then think ahead to the task, it's vast
Summon embers from ash
Slashing a veritable path through the Pantheon
The wrath of a champion

[Hook]
Chilled fingers each rely on a spark
To ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark
Stoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart
Smoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart
Chilled fingers each rely on a spark
To ignite the pyre, summon fire from dark
Stoke the ash for embers 'fore they pry them apart
Smoke rises, tiger of mind and lion of heart

[Outro]
(Ash...)
