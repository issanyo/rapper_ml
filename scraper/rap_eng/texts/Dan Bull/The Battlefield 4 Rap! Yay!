[Verse 1]
Oi, my name, is Daniel Recker
Join my game, and Dan'll wreck ya
Do me a nice favour
Get out of my face or
I might take a whole skyscraper
And even more later, maybe three to four acres
Plus every map from Paracel Storm, Resort to Dawnbreaker
Sneak into my Flood Zone, you're cover's soon blown
I'll turn your dog tag into a little tombstone
Is this a revolutionary game or just a new clone?
Who knows?
Judging by the sales figures, you don't
Man, I could stand here and shoot for hours
'Till I've taken out everyone of the three global superpowers
A vision of the future, 2020
My vision's super duper, 20/20
I'm equiped with many shooters, plenty, plenty
Big Bang, Sheldon Cooper, Penny, Penny

[Hook]
Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before
Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
Is it Battlefield 3?
No, it's Battlefield 4
(x2)

[Verse 2]
You know Dan's mission is make a Rogue Transmission
Set the dial on your radio and listen
What happens when you open a platinum battlepack?
You get a single track CD, this battle rap
You're the PC, to my Apple Mac
Fundamentally opposed, so get out my habitat
I'll blast mags, even more than Jackfrags
Point at all the things with the same finger with which I snatch tags
It doesen't matter what I see these fools toting
I just double it up, dual scoping
One for each of your prepubecent balls, grow some
School's open, and I leave every rule broken

[Hook]
Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before
Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
Is it Battlefield 3?
No, it's Battlefield 4
(x2)

[Verse 3]
I've got a bull's head, I think I'm a minotaur
I shot you fools dead, extinct, like a dinosaur
Look at you crying now, what you whining for?
You can either leave through the window or by the door
There's a pile of corpses by your fortress
Who left that there?
Well, I'd have thought it was me
'Cos I'm the type to counter-knife y'all
Wipe the blood off my brow and say "wow, how delightful"
A knife in a gunfight, this is how it's done, right?
If I didn't give you a chance, it'd be unpolite
There's panic in the streets, Humberside
You are not safe here, Honey Pie
Ask Bonnie Tyler what I did to her heart
I more than eclipsed it, I ripped it apart
I'd rather play Battlefield than with her tits and her arse
Regarding military ditties, I turned it to an art
Listen

[Hook]
Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
The best Battlefield since the Battlefield before
Battlefield 4, Battlefield 4
Is it Battlefield 3?
No, it's Battlefield 4

[Outro]
Hip-hop-ha, clippity-clap
This is the Battlefield Rap, yay!
