[Intro]
Dear Anjem Choudary

[Verse]
So you've been writing open letters, I write them aswell
But I'm polite and don't threaten the fires of Hell
So save your sermon for others
Not a person that's just lost a serviceman they loved lots
My brother lost a good buddy, Robbie
You won't convert his mother
You'll just turn public opinion to thinking you're a worthless bugger What on earth are you going to achieve in grieving
The recently bereaved? It seems pretty mean to me

It's a useless tactic using Wootton Bassett
And with such a blunder, no wonder you're viewed as a fanatic
I hate to be rude, but the fact's clear and loud to me:
You could use some class, Mr. Choudary
How many people do you think you're going to convert
When recently you've seemed to be a bit of a berk?

Most of these are just kids, they're not the warmongers
The decisions are made by politicians, they should face your criticism
There's better ways to raise awareness of Muslims' plights
Like look at Lowkey, he's doing something right
He self-released a song for Palestine and Gaza
And now the track's reached number one in the Amazon charts

And people are listening, taking it on board
And not retaliating with hateful scrawls on Facebook walls
It takes some balls to spread a polemic message
But it takes brains to ensure everyone gets it
I want to see these countries free from military and killing
I want to see stability
So if your protest goes ahead, I hope there's no stress
But don't be surprised that in the people's eyes you're hopeless
