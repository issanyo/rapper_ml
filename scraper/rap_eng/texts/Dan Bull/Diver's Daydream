[Verse]
My feet leave the diving board
In time to the awe of the audience
Now I'm aboard the flight
Arms rise from my sides
And combine to form a spire
And rise before the fall
But I don't fall
I glide toward the water
All the time my thoughts
Are all but paused
I slice the water like a fallen Titan
All Poseidon's glory shines in my form
For a fleeting moment I don't breathe
But I believe in so much
The pressure represses the
Pressures of everything ever
So that only the moment
That's present is precious
A pregnant pause
Rise to the surface
Emerge and
Then the roar
A perfect dive
10's the score
It's worth the rise
When you fall like this
