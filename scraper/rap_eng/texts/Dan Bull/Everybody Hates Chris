[Hook: Dan Bull]
Everybody hates Chris
Everybody hates Chris Leese
'Cause he's
An absolute wanker
(2x)

[Verse 1: Chris Leese]
Well, that's a true fact
I'm an absolute twat
When I've had a few cans, my attitude's bad
Pissy at the party, sniffing Charlie
'Till my fuckin' jaw's wired like Kanye
I smoke crack, just in case you didn't know that
Swallowing Prozac with bottles of Cognac
It's me, Chris Leese
Wiping dick cheese on your bird's titties
And anyone who wanna challenge this
Will be having sicker flashbacks than Catholic kids on acid trips
Hyperactive prick, I need calm down
All I do is dart 'round making fart sounds
Far out, the loudest voice in the crowd
I can't front, I'm probably annoying you now
But I'm not Chris Evans, Willis or Brown
I'm the most hated boy in the town

[Hook]
Everybody hates Chris
Everybody hates Chris Leese
'Cause he's
An absolute wanker
(2x)

[Verse 2]
I've been a twat since I came out my dad's dick
And snapped the plastic on the prophylactic
They grew into a fat prick who raps sick
Chat shit, and uh, I think that's it
So never second guess the best sex pest, bitch
[?] and a dress gets ripped
Forget my friends, I never get a text, [?]
And then you'll press reject on my friend request
Sipping cider in the cypher
I don't write chipmunk, or Tinchy Stryder
Or Diddy or 50 or Dizzy neither
I fuckin' hate grime and Drake's a shitty rhymer
So fuck the shows on the idiot box
Fuck the X Factor and the kiddies that watch
My surname's not Tucker, Griffin or Rock
The little twat that's pissing you off

[Hook]
Everybody hates Chris
Everybody hates Chris Leese
'Cause he's
An absolute wanker
(2x)
