[Intro]
We're all just bags of meat and blood
Trying not to be punctured
Bundles of nerves and veins
So vainly averse to pain
Just hunks of gristle and gore
That can't take this any more
Just sacks of guts and bone
Desperate not to die alone

[Verse 1]
Hi, I'm a sweet boy, made out of meat, boy
Need to save my lady from the baddie with the beef, boy
Got to beat this doctor fetus, he's a creep boy
What a learning curve, it's certainly steep, boy
Keep you up at night, don't deserve any sleep, boy
Leave you hanging from the side of your seat, boy
You're gonna be born, die, then repeat, boy
What's the matter, you look white as a sheet, boy
I don't believe you're in the league for the feat, boy
You're gonna keep seeing heaps of defeat, boy
Better leave the kitchen if you're bothered by the heat, boy
Spinning razors, better pray and then leap, boy
Feel the breeze of the blades on your feet, boy
By the way, there's no way you can cheat, boy
This is something only the elite will complete, boy
We can see how bad you wanna be the Meat Boy

[Pre-Chorus]
We're all just bags of meat and blood
Trying not to be punctured
Bundles of nerves and veins
So vainly averse to pain
Just hunks of gristle and gore
That can't take this any more
Just sacks of guts and bone
Desperate not to die alone

[Chorus]
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Funny creature
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Is he gonna beat ya?
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
He's gonna beat ya
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Ouch!

[Verse 2]
(Hey) Never quit, will I make it? No, yes
Very quick, but I make slow progress
So frustrating, but wait, don't protest
Fate's close in the chase, say "Hello death"
Blow breath in his face 'cause you know best
No less than the greatest, so blessed
Don't stress 'cause the greatest mistake
You can make in this game is inflaming the rage
Instead of taking, embracing the pain
With the patience of saints operating your brain
(Ahh) How many ways can you fall to your doom?
'Til you swear fate's rubbing salt in the wounds (hah)
But even the toughest enemy
Crumbles to dust under muscle memory
Now he's just a memory that's corrupt, so delete, boy
And put your trust in the Meat Boy

[Pre-Chorus]
We're all just bags of meat and blood
Trying not to be punctured
Bundles of nerves and veins
So vainly averse to pain
Just hunks of gristle and gore
That can't take this any more
Just sacks of guts and bone
Desperate not to die alone

[Chorus]
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Funny creature
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Is he gonna beat ya?
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
He's gonna beat ya
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Ouch!

[Pre-Chorus]
We're all just bags of meat and blood
Trying not to be punctured
Bundles of nerves and veins
So vainly averse to pain
Just hunks of gristle and gore
That can't take this any more
Just sacks of guts and bone
Desperate not to die alone

[Chorus]
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Funny creature
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Is he gonna beat ya?
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
He's gonna beat ya
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Ouch!

Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Funny creature
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Is he gonna beat ya?
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
He's gonna beat ya
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
Ouch!

[Outro]
Meat Boy, super Meat Boy
