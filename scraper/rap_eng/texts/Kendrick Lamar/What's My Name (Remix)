[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell me you love me
Know that it's real
I can see more
See how you feel
Look at my eyes
Do you realise
What is the truth
Your surprise
I despise, whatever's right
You're the wrong
This is my life
This is of you
This is of me
This is the truth
This is of we
This is for love
This here is God
This here is yours
This here is ours
Look at my eyes
Tell me you want me
Tell me you see me
I know you haunt me
I know you love me
I know the truth
I know the real
I'm speaking in you
I'm speaking in us
I'm speaking in we
I'm speaking in God
I'm speaking in free
You know who we be
You know that it's life
I know when you're wrong
I know when you're right
Just look in my eyes
I know your surprised
You tell me the truth
I know you despise
Ho!

[Bridge: Prince]
Take this mic, I can't sing
It only makes me wish for
The way things used to be
You can slap my face, PSH!
But I got to say it
You never would have drank my coffee
If I would have served you cream

[Chorus: Prince]
Tell me what's my name?
Tell me what's my name?
Tell me what's my name?
Tell me what's my, name? Oww!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Tell me you love me
Tell me it's real
I know the truth
I know you feel
Look at my eyes
Do you despise?
What have I said?
You're surprised
My lies
We hide in lies
What is free?
What is God?
This is the truth
This is the earth
This is for you
This is for her
This is for me
This is for we
This is for us
You can see
You're surprised
I realize
What is the truth
So help me God
I know that it's real
Know you fulfill
What I do love
What I do feel
Looking at you
Looking at we
This is more
Than jewelry
This is your life
This is my life
Look at me once
Look at me twice
Say it again
Born to win
Living in God
Hoping it's the end
I....Ho! Ho! Ho!
