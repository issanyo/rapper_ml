[Verse One: ZZ Ward]
Baby, nobody knows a word that you saying
Your breath is reeking like whiskey, what hair you got left is graying
You’re out on my porch yelling, waking the neighbors
Wanting me to come and save you with your aggressive behavior

[Hook: ZZ Ward]
You’re stumbling all over town, you drink till you drown
You keep on threatening to bring me down
You don’t make the rules, you drunk old fool
See, you don’t scare me, you’re just crying wolf
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy

[Verse Two: ZZ Ward]
Breaking my door down when I left the lock open
There ain’t much left to be broken
Your flies are wet, then you’re soaking
It’s like the Devil just jumped up in your clothes
He put on your shoes and rolled
And still you're scared to be alone

[Hook 2: ZZ Ward & Kendrick Lamar]
You’re stumbling all over town, you drink till you drown
You keep on threatening to bring me down
You don’t make the rules, you drunk old fool
See, you don’t scare me, you’re just crying wolf
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy
Whoa, whoa, go on and cry boy, whoa, whoa, go on and cry, cry boy
Cry, cry boy, cry boy
Nobody knows what you’re saying (I mean, you need to)
I know the game that you’re playing (I mean, you need to)

[Verse Three: Kendrick Lamar]
Don’t forget about us, don’t forget about trust
Don’t forget about the kinkiness of playing with the cuffs on a bedspring
Penetrate the loud screams, echo in the hallway is a must
I could never let go if I wanna whore, duck, away from your anatomy
The agony is such a pain I could never endure even if I had the cure
With the pure, sweet morphine touch, I mean, I cannot deny my demise to lies
That interrupted our future, I mean, if I compromise, will you improvise?
Please don’t pin no lies, I’m used to you forgiving and then you forget the truth
I promise that I’ll commit, vamoose to all my old ways
I’m done howling today, a full moon will never exist, I swear

[Hook]
