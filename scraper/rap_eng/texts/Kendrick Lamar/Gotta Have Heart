[Intro]
Yeah we gone keep it moving man
Your man DJ Skee holdin' it down
With my man Jay Rock
Next fuckin' superstar of the West Coast
Remember where you heard it first
You can tune in to him, on my radio show
You know we always playin' his shit
Saturday nights, Channel 40
Hip-Hop nation, satellite radio, let's go

[Hook: Jay Rock]
It ain't nothing for a soldier to bleed
Takes a real gangsta to squeeze (real talk)
Only the strong survive, you see
Plus the strong don't cherish the weak (gotta have heart)
It ain't nothing for a soldier to bleed
Takes a real gangsta to squeeze (real talk)
Only the strong survive, you see
Plus the strong don't cherish the weak (gotta have heart)

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Pull up in the whip, identical black
Two bitches inside, identical racks
Two guns on my side, identical gats
Leave a nigga bleeding fast in need of a pad
Look, when a nigga broke, in need of some cash
I'll hit a house fast, with the heat and a mask
All fingers on triggers, itching to blast
Everybody on the floor, yelling "Where's the stash?"
[?] then I'm out split second to dash
Swerving through enemy lines might bust me a cap
Then I pull the car over throw the strap in the trash
Make sure the coast's clear, no signs of the crash
Only the strong survive, when I speak it it's real
Dawg it's real on this field, get killed for the skrill
Got ice on your hand, get killed for your chill
Killer Cali you bastard, keep you a steel

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Pull out the Aston Martin
If you talking too much pull out my coffin
Pull out another one for his brother
Real comfortable, even get his favourite colour
I burn rubber off the V12
I fuck international females
My last bitch bitch was speaking some German shit
Catch me vacating on the Germany trip
Eyes red, sandals on like, fuck what Cam'ron said
I'm pecking for the bread
But nothing like a pigeon
I'm something like a vulture
You wanna know how I do it mothafucka I'll coach ya
They call me Phil Jackson
I train your day like Denzel, welcome to practice
Yes I'm the baddest, if my lyrics had looks
This rhyme right here belong in the beauty pageant
J. Brown asked me do I got it, been had it
This beat is pornographic
I fuck off it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big Wy]
Enemy down, left his ass spread apart
Trying to get back to the whip, fuck it won't start
Now I'm on foot back to the turf
Disguised in these colours of this nigga I murked
Hide in the bush, hit the bitch on the chirp
This where I'm at, don't let the ones get here first
So as she pulled up, I jumped in the Magnum
Took my clothes off and burned 'em, after I bagged 'em
I shoot shots through your new era
Have your face airbrushed on a all white new sweater
Before the judge say you're [?]
I'm jumping out, dumping, let him kill me in a stand off
Please [?], take me away
At least back behind the car I fire back with the K
That's what it is, fire back where you stay
I spent my whole life trying to climb back with the yay
