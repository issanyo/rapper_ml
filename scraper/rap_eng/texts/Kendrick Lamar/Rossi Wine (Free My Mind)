[Intro]
Uh...... Yeah.....

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Sippin on that Rossi Wine
Puffin turtle feelin fine
Its just me, myself and I
All I need to free my mind
Nigga, nigga (Im Out'chea) nigga, nigga, nigga (Im Out'chea)

[Hook: Droop-E]
Puffin turtle feelin fine
Sippin Carlo Rossi Wine
Its just me, myself and I
All I need to free my mind
Nigga, nigga (Im Out'chea) nigga, nigga, nigga (Im Out'chea)

[Verse 1: Droop-E]
Yeah, Uh, don't worry bout whats in my cup
Sippin on that purple stuff and I ain't talkin syrup bruh
Carlo Rossi wine, Burgundy, ask about Droop-E
I guarantee your bitches heard about me with the urgency
She just wanna suck success, smoke turtle
We call it turtle 'cause it's green and it makes you move slow
Donatello, green or purple ain't no suckas' in my circle
Money on my mental, heavy on my grizzle
This ain't a movie, they'll rob you for your Dinero

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
In the middle of the Warzone I be on
Sippin on a big bottle of that burgundy
Mutha'fuck yo styrofoam
Big barrel, baritone
And It sound like Barry White
And it boom like an eight-o-eight
Turn yo' ass to a parasite
On the freeway I rock to the snare
Don't get me out my loop my nigga
A bad bitch I ride with a pair
Like the fruit my nigga
The paparazzi gone shoot my nigga
But I don't pay em' no attention, Im a put em' in detention
Head of the class, head in the e-class with the tint missin'
You said, I know that you said
More company? I probably don't need it

[Hook]

[Outro: E-40 (Repeat x2)]
Top of the line wine, Carlos Rossi
Cause I'm on some of that
Top of the line wine, Carlos Rossi
