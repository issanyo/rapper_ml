[Intro]
K-Boy, Kendrick Lamar
TB ain’t shit yap
Ya dig?

[Hook]
With no struggle, there's no progress
I make a feel in the hood to the projects
And I'm riding down the path of the success
You know them haters in them straps
But I took that by any means necessary nigga, I’mma get it
Fall down and get up, guaranteed I ain't quitting
So victory’s the only outcome
Heart of a lion with the mind of Malcolm, yeah

[Verse 1]
They say great minds think alike
Well I'mma think like Malcolm and Martin
Before I even think the right
I'm trying to have more good days than evil nights
No matter what they say my people ain't got equal rights
Hope we get wises and we better hit the visuals
But all we have is funerals and candle light visuals
And gang banging and pimping is like a ritual
You lying ass rappers, I'm telling you obituary
Glasses say I can’t get that so I'm thinking more
I need answers so I'm knocking at the preacher's door
Told me never look back so I proceed forward
I'm the hope for these niggers in the street sad war
Some niggers pulled it for me and tried to test my
Shot my car up, I wasn't thinking with my best mind
But my faith in God became on Teflon
That's why I cherish every moment in the waste time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I said they trying to cap some G shit some more
Flow china white like a sheep in the snow
I go deep as the Bible I can debate with the pope
And you rappers go down and he go like a sky on the slope
I be on a boat with pappy
But I ain't trying to cop no work
I'm trying to cop me the boat and some more property
I told Rock you gotta be more than just a commodity
Make the house name and entity to infinity
They want me off the juice, no grenadier
And stop from thinking presidential like this guy that brings the Kennedy
After is hot tuck down so the crowd won't witness me
Now, can somebody locate Mr Shakur?
And tell these 2 Pacs they 2 shots away from 2 blocks
Of being neighbors with our all mighty lord
We put your best material wind and fast forward
Kendrick signing off, I’m sure your signature’s for

[Hook]
With no struggle, there's no progress
I make a feel in the hood to the projects
And I'm riding down the path of the success
You know them haters in them straps
But I took that by any means necessary nigga, I’mma get it
Fall down and get up, guaranteed I ain't quitting
So victory’s the only outcome
Heart of a lion with the mind of Malcolm, yeah
