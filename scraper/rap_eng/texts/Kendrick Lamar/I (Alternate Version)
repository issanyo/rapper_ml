[Intro]
We're livin' in a gold bar (Runnin' to the right law)
Duckin' in the trap (Duckin' in the trap)
Livin' in a group (Livin' in a group)
Watchin' TV (Watchin' TV)
Dedicated to the homies in the pen, hit me

[Verse 1]
(Hey, hey, hey)
Uh, this is a word premiere, this is a world premiere
(Hey, hey)
Uh, I done been through a whole lot
Trial, tribulation, but I know God
The Devil want to put me in a bow-tie
Pray that the holy water don't go dry, yeah, yeah
As I look around me
So many motherfucker want to down me
But an amigo never drowned me
In front of a dirty double-mirror they found me

[Hook]
And I love myself
Ho, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, it ain't that high
I love myself
Uh, one day at a time sun gon' shine

[Verse 2]
Everybody lookin' at you crazy (Crazy)
What you gon' do? (What you gon' do?)
Lift up your head and keep movin'? (Keep movin'?)
Or let the paranoia haunt you (Haunt you)
Peace to fashion police, I wear my heart
On my sleeve, let the runway start
You know the miserable do love company
What do you want from me and my scars?
Everybody lack confident
Everybody lack confident
How many time my potential was anonymous?
How many time the city makin' me promises?
So I promise this, huh

[Hook]
I love myself
When you're lookin' at me, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated hands of God, boy, don't seem shy
I love myself
One day at a time sun gon' shine

[Verse 3]
Want to say it's a war outside, bomb in the street
Gun in the hood, mob of police
Rock on the corner with a line for the fiend
And a bottle full of lean and a model on a scheme
(These days of frustration keep y'all on tuck and rotation)
Aw, man, I duck these cold faces, post a fee-fi-fo-fum basis
Uh, dreams of reality's peace
Blow steam in the face of the beast
Sky can fall down, the wind can cry now
Strong in me, I still smile

[Hook]
I love myself
Uh, when you're lookin' at me, uh, I tell me, "What do you see?"
I love myself
Ah, I put a bullet in the back of the back of the head of the police
I love myself
Uh, illuminated by the hand of God, boy, don't be shy
I love myself
One day at a time sun gon' shine
Everybody, hit me

[Bridge]
Walk my bare feet (Walk my bare feet)
Down, down valley deep (Down, down valley deep)
Fee-fi-fo-fum (Fee-fi-fo-fum)
My heart undone (My heart undone)

[Interlude]
Aw, man, ay, check this out
It's a real Compton thing goin' on right now
You feel what I'm talkin' 'bout? You dig that?
Sometime I just feel a little bit b-beside myself
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
This here's the return of Enoch
And we gon' do it to y'all like this
Here we go, one, two, three, hit me

[Hook]
I love myself
The world is a ghetto with big guns and Dickies signs
I love myself
But it can do what it want whenever it want and I don't mind
I love myself
He said I got to get up, life is more than suicide
I love myself
One day at a time, the sun gon' shine

[Verse 4]
I went to war last night with an automatic weapon
Don't nobody call a medic
I'm a do it 'til I get it right, war last night
I've been dealin' with depression
Duckin' every other blessin', I can never see the message
I could, I could never take the lead, never bob and weave
Negative is lettin' them annihilate me
Evident I'm movin' at a meteor speed
Finna run into a buildin' there
Money in the ceilin', lay my body in the street
Pass me to the buildin' of the holy unseen
Pass me to the feelin' of the holy unseen
Seen enough, make a everybody scream, "I love myself"

[Bridge]
I lost my head
I must've misread what the good book said
Oh, woes be me, it's a jungle inside
Give myself again 'til the well runs dry

[Interlude]
YG, chicken wings, I love myself
I love myself, I love myself
Aw, man, ay, ay, homie
I told you it's straight up a Compton thing
You dig what I'm talkin' about?
And this here's dedicated to the homies
Y'all feel what I'm sayin'?
Sometimes I just get besides myself
The return of the Enoch is back
You hear what I'm talkin' 'bout?

[Verse 5]
Uh, I've been lookin' for you my whole life
Appetite for the feelin' I can barely describe
Where you reside?
In a woman, is it in money or mankind?
Something's got me losin' my mind
Where you at? From the front to the back
I'm lookin' for you, I react only when you react
I thought I found you back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the dirtiest pistol
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you're not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don't need you anyway
Don't lie to me, I'm suicidal any day
I could be your advocate
I could speak for you if you tell me what the matter is
I could preach for you with the mighty tongue
I'm the one, how can I overcome
Negative energy, more like infinity, and survive?
