Its hilarious
They make me sick, malaria
All up in my area
Bi*ch i ain't scared of ya
Call me weak all you want
Im still way ahead of ya
I will still be around when your freinds thinkin dead of ya
The day i make it
Swear ill forget it all
If i keep on thinkin about it
Itll prolly make me fall
But i won't let that happen
Swear i will have a ball
And if i keep workin hard
One day ill have it all
And i ain't talkin about cash
Not even talkin bout the cash
Not even the case
And i dont want a bad bi*ch
So get the fu*ck out my face
Im trapped in this place
They won give me no space
I try to inhale and breathe
And i start up a chase
Im gettin close to the gates
I can feel it in my soul
So i gots to rebel
And tell em all that its on
Gettin calls from god
I can here the ringtone
But i miseed tht call
And received a text
Sayin its all for the best
So keep on grindin
And be expecting a test
Oh and one more thing never strive for the less
Competition is feirce
But dont shed no tears
Just work for some years
Itl come to your ears
And it will open your eyes
And show you the prize
And i know that you know that i speak no lies
Just listen to me and you will reach the sky

Verse 2
And tonight
I will say goodbye
To anyone that ever hated
Tryna have a goodtime
I will shine
How could i not
Ill reach the top
With all i got chasin my dream
Like a cop chasen kids with marijuana
Yes i am sober but i can get higher than i stoner
Smoken of my bars i hit it hard
Off my gaurd
Oh my lord
Off the charts
Im a star
Must get far
Workin hard
You think you know it all
Boa sit down
Wit ya dumbass ego
Actin like a dumbass clown
You jus arrogant
Thinkin that you run this town
Talkin shit about rappers to make yourself look better
Thats pathetic
Better yet sympathetic
I feel sorry for you
Boa i wish i was a medic
Cus clearly you are sick
Infected with jealousy
Creating your enemies
With ridiculous tendency
Strong than hennessy
I refuse to be shot down
Without a strong quick burn to the stomach
Shoot me all you want i will feel nothin from it
Tulani boa soul rebel
I will never plummet'gun it
I love it
Keep it 100
Keep it dont shun it
Open dont shut it
I feed off of love hate will only make me vomit
They feed off of hate and im wishen they would stop it
