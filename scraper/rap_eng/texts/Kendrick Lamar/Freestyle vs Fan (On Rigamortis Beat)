Kendrick:

Got me breathing with dragons
I crack the egg on you bastard
Why you step to the master
Like you sick with this
I really do this shit
You not equivalent to the Kdot the almighty
Watch this, I will body
Anybody in the crowd
You want me john gotti, couldn't see me
You peeping this is freestyle off top of the dome
I'll let you know why every other rapper need to go home
This a new verse, I put rappers in new hearse
I take rappers to new church
Who wanna see me, you first
Then him second, then you third
Nouns, my verbs
Battle these words
Nigga that shit is absurd

Troi Breeze:

OK if I'm 2nd or I'm 3rd
Whatever he just said you heard
But I'm coming through and I think that I got a new verse
Goin' off the top of the dome
I'm really tryna change the way that I've been livin' at home
I'm really doin' it
Nigga I be doin' this
Nigga I come through with this
Nigga I will do it and I swear I am so studious
Nigga I'm a student and I peeped the way you did it
Now I'm bout to do it off of the top of the fuckin' tip

Kendrick:

If you bout to do off of the top, then fucking did it
If you say that you the best, then nigga won't you admit it
I see you got the waves in your hair i been there
Back in 8th grade, when the pussy i was scared
But now im seeing all kinds of woman in peripheral
This is individual, this here is a ritual
This here is spiritual
This is not rap , this is god body
Nigga this ain't nothing close to lyrical

Troi Breeze:

Shit all I'm sayin now is I agree with you
I been grownin' in it like I was a tree with you
Now I'm tryna do it like I was a seed and I grew up
And now I'm blessed like I just sneezed; hachew
I really appreciate it
I really appreciate you callin me up cause I'm out here and I'm ballin' it up
Taking the biggest shots, and now I been getting' it tryna spend the biggest knots
Cause I'm really out here tryna grind for my family
Tryna go off of that energy, I know you feel my "inner G"
My brotha was from Piru
My pops was from what's he was raised out on Grape Street

Kendrick:

Well if ya brother was from Piru and your partna was from Watts
Then you should already know about them Compton blocks
All my niggas that's with me is from the city
All my niggas hold choppas and they be with me
And this is TDE this is stri-stri- strictly for my niggas and bitches tell me you with me
(crowd roar)
You see that scream right there, thats that scream that every other rapper scared
Thats that scream that every other clapper scared
They dont want shoot back
If they did they would get bitch slapped like my nigga Snoop Dogg back in '94
This is Kurupt flow
This is the LBC shit
This the Compton DPGTDE shit
FUCK WITH ME SHIT

Make some noise for my nigga

Troi Breeze:
