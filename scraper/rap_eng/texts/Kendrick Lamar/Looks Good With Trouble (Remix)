[Verse 1: Solange]
Hey little heartache, skipping out of town
And let’s stay out of trouble, you make it look good
Hey young heartache, you’re looking kinda charming
On the cul-de-sac, where nobody comes looking
Hey, little heartache, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good
Hey young lover, let’s live on the Broadway
Take me to the Bridge but be sure to come look
Hey young heartache, you’re looking kinda charming
On the cul-de-sac, hope nobody comes looking
Hey, young lover, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good

[Hook]
And there ain’t nobody loving me, down
The way you make me go places I forbid
And the spaces I should have known
And there ain’t nobody breaking me down
The way you make me go places I forbid
And the spaces I should have known

[Verse 2: Solange]
Hey little heartache, won’t you leave your mark
In corners of the dark where you make it look good?
We’ve taken this too far
But let me play the part where you should’ve stayed put
Hey, little heartache, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good
Hey young lover, let’s live on the Broadway
Take me to the Bridge but be sure to come look
Hey young heartache, you’re looking kinda charming
On the cul-de-sac, hope nobody comes looking
Hey, young lover, turn us on the highway
Let’s get into trouble, you make it look good

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
In the late week, I was in London
I really wanna get into something
Bus way too cold (way too cold)
And I don’t wanna feel that numbness
And I just had a show, and I wanted you to go
But you had one too, I was wondering
Are the time gods on my side?
If so, God, press that button
Stuck on a tall-ass bus
Like 14 bunks and I can’t even sleep
And I hate getting drunk so I don’t got a cup
But I’ve got James Mason on repeat
I’m tryna stay on that good thing
You know?
Whatever song Heaven would sing
You know?
Broken up Alphabets
How can I get this convo to stay comprehensive
When the service is never working
And the Wi-Fi is out commission
And I’m not short with you on purpose
I’m a man of just few words
If you like to chat, then in fact
My job is to make sure you’re heard
Ms. Chatty — I’m like one message from calling a taxi
Exactly, I’ll catch a cold but as long as you match me
It’s actually a troublesome world when you think about it
So admit it, we both could look good with it if you’re the stylist
Hold up…
Digga-da digga-da digga-da da
Digga digga digga da digga da da
You stay in that dank lounge, I'mma sit an decide
And P.S., the Olive Oils always love the Popeyes, I guess
I guess…
