[Kendrick Lamar]
My turbulence put a burden on young herds
And once it's cracking it's a chain reaction
Minus Young Berg
Killing with no excellence
X-amount with no excellence
To X em out with these words
Panoramic views be tumbling out my mind
No panoramic views, bullets tumbling out no nines
Big AKs like Alicia Keys abbreviated
And nowadays, niggas stand behind em like Clive Davis
Clyde Drexler, before the hook I dribble niggas
On the stretcher. A understatement to say
That K Lamar was under pressure
Don't press your luck when you pressed for time
Cause when the press get this verse
They're sure to press rewind
A president's prayer, can't say what's in my cul de sac
Codeine, crack and codiac
Enough violence to keep the Devil smiling while we
Wyling on the corners with the ? rats
Niggas build a trap house, hope that Gotti
Don't run his trap. See the fans that tap out
That's wrestler shit. Don't rest your case
With the gaze just cause you wrestled your bitch
We catching bodies and catching fades in the hotel lobbies
Fuck the security and that's at the Ritz Carlton
My impurity is probably your best asset
Spit ass, hit your block and chrome and your address
Leave em stagnant
This is torture when I scorch ya
Or escort ya out the building with ex-convicts
And all sorts of criminal handshakes
Your man can't stick to the script
With handpaint. Poppin your lip, then poppin the clip
Then poppin your van, wait
I want the peace. But keep the piece
That I was Malcolm to your belief, wassup
