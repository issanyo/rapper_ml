*Hook*
Say I'm Proud To Be Hmong
H.M.O.N.G
That's Who I Am & That's Who I'll Always Be
Aggression Taken The Day That We All Was Birth
Let These Suckaz Know How much We All've Been Hurt
I Say I'm Proud To Be Hmong
H.M.O.O.B
That's Who I Am & That's Who I'll Always Be
Believe In(G) Lies Was So Wrong I Tell It All
And Let 'Em All Know EveryBody Sing Along

*Verse 1*
Living life without an answer
And unsolvable questions
Hoping God will hear our prayers
As we sit here and listen
But Oh No!
I guess this life for us is tragedy
Believe in me
I try to make us see the image that we want to see
And if we help the damn U.S
But we ain't even treated with the same respect
Explain that!
My brothaz on crack
They try to fight back
Drug convinced
So you know that they ain't never fight back
My sistaz on knees
They wanted y'all to see
A good women of Hmong
Live in communities
But y'all was too blind to realize
So fuck off
Don't let me change my damn mind
With Real lies
And if we plead
To what we believe
A damn change will lead
The life that we wanna see
So bare along with me
As we sing this melody
For my Hmong OGz
Uhh
My H.M.O.O.B

*Verse 2*
So it has come down to this
Racist niggas deserve to get diss
They talking many shit
How we Hmongs couldn't make it
Now I'm here to speak the truth
Let us rise as a leader of youth
Brains be planted like the roots
I'm here to show ya
I'm Tony Vue
I'm coming thru
Showing all my fellow gooks
Showing that we real we true
So keep your fist high and fight for your life
They say life is a test but are they right
Trouble seems to be attached to us like magnets
No time to wait for homos & faggots
Just live your life & just love it
Cause most of us will never make it
Only take some to say it
So take this opportunity and take it
I promise you You'll need it
No time to even waste it
With all these hesitation
And muthafuckaz complaining
We own this muthafuckin' game
So rep Hmong All the way
And say H.M.O.N.G Nigga, Yeee!
