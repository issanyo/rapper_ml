[Verse 1]
Gringo on the track
Put 2 kilos in my back
I done left that life
I won't make mill off of that
One day Wayne gon call me back
One day I will throw the strap
Issa day we all pray
For a handshake
But all we get
Is a hand in the face
From the same fame
Same game
Fuck that shit nigga
Run that shit nigga
I don't love triggers
But I love to play with em
Pull that shit on accident
Misunderstood those actions bitch
Fuck you and your ambulance
I don't know what's happening
Who's to blame
Nigga I'm a drone
I don't know
I feel like jeranimo
I feel like your momma hoe
Your bitch on my god damn phone
Think she gon' get me blown
No
Fuck she won't
Not saying nothing personal
I came firstly to the stone
Nobody been here
Snatch the throne
Fuck you mean
We sell the show
Fuck you mean
We made the flow
I don't know
No I don't know
I know I'm at it
So let me grow

Fake smile bitch
Same face
From before
I know your game nigga

Selfish ass motherfucking bitch
Stacking the paper until you get rich
That's not how we roll
We spend it or don't
We know to get poor
But I'm ripping the core
Back on it yeah

No I don't do that
I'm smoking on weed
No I don't do that
I threw that shit out
Cause It's making me sad
It's making me bad
But I am to good to be average so blast
Making me offer some shit that I craft
Looking for offers but nobody's asked
Pass me the bitch you know she will get smashed
Sucking my dick she amazing at that
Nobody asked me If I am the last
Niggas be crazy and crapping bout cast
Passed me the blunt I fake passed it to back
Back to back
Dreams are my past
Everything cool
No bullets we're splashed
Now everything mad
Quick to the fast
Quick to the fast
Now go
First to the seventy floor
Flying through clouds
Nigga you swore

Now I'm running the store
Get ready for war
Escape through the back door

Fucking your angle
