[Verse 1]
I've been known to flip on niggas, spaz on bitches
One state of mind, I'm out for the riches
I've seen good crack, uncle stuck in the kitchen
Now behind prison, phone calls can't visit
Seventeen, half of my life has been explicit
Rated R content, no supervision
With you talking nonsense, I'm not trynna listen
I'm a point guard, small forward, play your position
Before you wind up in the lake with the fishes
On a blind date with a crocodile, vicious
I switch the flow so you say that I sound different
But the flow is the same reason my dick kill bitch kissing??
And that's the same reason your not in my competition
Cause I swear right now that none of yall existing
Fall off is probably what you wishing
But I can't stop, won't stop, young gunning you niggas
I've been known to have stash for the burnnin
And break a bitch down to the point that I learn them
And when I get dough, I'mma let you know, throw the cake in your face like Ike Turner
I turn a schoolgirl into a dick smuggler, sex publisher, rated X government
See me in the hooptie boy, it's not a cover up
See I'm a young black boy who don't give a fuck, what
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna grab your shit
Cock back and blast some shit
Empty, reload the clip
You won't find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it
This that gangsta shit that make you wanna blaze this spliff
Get drunk, grab a fifth, open it, guzzle it quick
You won't find nothing hotter than this
Whatcha know about it
