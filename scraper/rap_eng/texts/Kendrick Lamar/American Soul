[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Blessed are the bullies
For one day they will have to stand up to themselves
Blessed are the liars
For the truth can be awkward

[Verse 1: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around

[Bridge 1: Bono]
Look around, look around
Look around, it's a sound
Look around, look around
It's a sound

[Verse 2: Bono]
It's not a place
This country is to me a thought
That offers grace
For every welcome that is sought

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul

[Verse 3: Bono]
It's not a place
This is a dream the whole world owns
The pilgrim's face
It had your heart to call her home

[Refrain]
Hold on Brother John
Too many mothers weepin'
Dream on Brother John
But in your dreams you can't be sleepin'

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
We came here looking for American soul
American
American

[Bridge 2: Bono]
Put your hands in the air
Hold up the sky
Could be too late, but we still gotta try
There's a moment in our life where a soul can die
And the person in a country when you believe the lie
The lie (the lie, the lie)
There's a promise in the heart of every good dream
It's a call to action, not to fantasy
The end of a dream, the start of what's real
Let it be unity
Let it be community
For refugees like you and me
A country to receive us
Will you be our sanctuary
Refu-Jesus

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul

[Chorus: Bono]
You are rock and roll
You and I are rock and roll
You are rock and roll
Came here looking for American soul
American soul
American soul
