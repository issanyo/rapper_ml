--Humble Beginning--
District courts duck with me
Juries show love to me

Hey (Hol up, hol up, hol up) leggo

I remember working up, starting in the civil courts
Met the right people, now I'm lookin at supreme court
Higher powers apellate the Lower System's district courts
I reached a standing complementing then got overruled in court

--Recordscratch to countdown in DNA--
3.. 2.. 1
Republicans. Make me cut bass like a reverend
We discoverin true colors held within
So now I rely on dual court systems
I need some appeal to grow the STEM, cause these packed courts lookin fella thin like this ice I'm treading on

Constitutional court is what I'm praying on. That's word
