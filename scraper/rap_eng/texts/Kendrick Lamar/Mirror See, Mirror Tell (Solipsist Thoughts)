[Sang in the background throughout the song:]
Mirror see, mirror tell

[Verse 1:]
My whole life I was lucid dreaming awake
That's why all these years I couldn't find my way
Couldn't see my fate, couldn't picture my name
On a history book, after the word great
It was silly cause that's all i ever wished for
Lost in a world which I could not get before
Found myself on a full moon night
He was a werewolf, he tried to hide
Seems like he was a little bit shy
I knew it wasn't easy, but hoped and tried
To find him, to see how things go
But I was too scared to show
Forced him to unveil, although he didn't want
I put in risk our agglomerated bond
He went mad, then I lost my temper
But we were twins, new 9/11
We weren't angry, we've never been
But we were searching, and searching's a sin
And I felt like I was stupid as hell
We are the same, what did I expect?
I was an airhead and ignorant, that's all
Didn't know how to calm, this aflutter soul
Now it's me versus me, we should be amassed
But when the affray starts, there is no trust
We were afoul, why not try afresh
Amalgamation's afoot, no more this mess
Hoped it would work under these circumstances
Cause deep down there was fire, under these ashes
Just couldn't be found, I coulnd't realise
That I am the truth behind people's lies
In the aftereffect of being a stranger to me
In the aftermath of being a beast set free
Maybe I'm a hero, cause I fought my monster
Commited hubris, but I showed my luster
Maybe no hero, but who could stand this
Not knowing who are you
Not knowing whose is
The reflection in the mirror
These eyes seem known
But the whole picture makes my mind blown
That's why I'm searching to find myself
The mirror won't talk, trapped in its hell
That's why I'm searching to find who I am
The mirror can't see, what I really became
That's why I'm searching to find who's the man
Inside that mirror, behind that verse

[Verse 2:]
I watched my life happening but I don't know if I'm existing
I admitted I'm great but I don't know if I mean it
I tried to know more , what the hell was I thinking
How can I know more when I don't know if I'm living
My existence an illusion, my personality a creation
Everything around me a conscious hallucination
Lucid dreaming, or dreaming reality
Going crazy , all the way to insanity
Going schizo like the great John Nash
Hope these voices stop 'fore I prove Riemman's
Losing worth, degrading myself
Suicide bomber, haven't snapped yet
We Kamikazes convinced, for what we believe in
So are you, cause you think, reality's what you live in
Not something you made, not something you hope for
You hope these words ain't real, but they are. I think so
I made 'em for me, or you made 'em for you
You made me to peep subconscious truth
You actually made me be part of that
Part of a world you actually made up
Ain't no truth is true, so how's reality real
Ain't no me is you, but we share the same idea
Ain't gonna stop, but I'll make a pause
Cause I'm exhausted by these solipsist thoughts
