[Verse 1:]

Tell 'em, ok
Tell 'em I got plenty hustle to sell 'em
Heat by the fleet, displaying it very seldom
Lead how right to light ignite my cerebellum
Close to the pen like I had three felons
Come from a city where niggas show no remorse
And the corpse is just another homie taking this course
Of course my dream was to play in the final four
Til the twelve grade came and I was only five four
So Now I’m a graduate, looking to get higher
My pops knew a security job, he inquired
But ignorance is bliss, that's what I was told
I stop, drop the role when somebody else fired
Now there goes another black boy unemployed with a lot of free time
Which means he’s hungry or just a lot of free crime
I lived it in my rhymes, and when I hit the porch, this is what I realize
