From the very heart of me
Belief becomes action
And no distractions will take my eyes off the prize
Greatness is my goal
But there's failure on the way
Full of insecurity, self-hate and doubt
But what I can't control can't confine me
And what I can't do can't stop me
This is how I express myself
Not how I follow others expectations
But how I stay true
