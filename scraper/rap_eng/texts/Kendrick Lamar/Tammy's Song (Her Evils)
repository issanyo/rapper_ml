[Intro]
Don't judge me

[Verse 1]
I know this girl, she a real good girl and she be low-key
Looking like a star, with a real nice car, a Mercedes key
She got a nigga and she love this nigga, well, at least I think
Everytime we bark, she pay us no mind in the middle of the street
She be like:

[Hook 1]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...

[Verse 2]
Until one day he wasn't acting right
In the middle of the night, she checked his phone, Erica, right
When he plead the fifth, man, it was on, matter of fact she gone
Matter of fact Tyrone was on speed dial
So when she got home, it was going down, she go:

[Hook 2]
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...

[Verse 3]
I know this girl, she a real hood girl, and she with the shit
Keep her hair tied up, big bamboos, Mike Jordan kicks
With that big butt, but when I try to holla, she gon' resist
In her man she trust, so when I walk by her, she be screaming this
She be like:

[Hook 1]
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my nigga
Fuck them other niggas, I'll ride for my nigga
I'll die for my nigga, fuck them other...

[Verse 4]
Until one day he wasn't acting right in the middle of the night
She checked his pockets, found condoms by Magnum
And the moment they was acknowledged, she popped his eye
Then ran outside, then started driving on the passenger side
Homeboy was smiling, she gon':

[Hook 2]
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Fuck that other nigga when she tired of her nigga
Sick of lies from her nigga, fuck that other...

[Verse 5]
And so, these girls, these vulnerable girls, took they men up
Put 'em in their world, their vulnerable world, and just like that
It was only getting they feelings hurt, tell me how that sound?
They got fed up with the biggest question mark, they curious now
Cause when women get sick of men, they think of a big helping hand
To lend each other uncover emotions when lights dim
So when she telling her to come over, it'll be alright
The minute she hit the block and turn left, she'll be turning dyke, they:

[Hook 3]
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches when they tired of these niggas
Fuck with other bitches on the side 'cause these niggas...
