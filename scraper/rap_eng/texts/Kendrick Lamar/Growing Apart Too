[Intro: Jhene Aiko]
Where are you going now?
Why are you slowing down?
Why, why, why?

[Hook: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going?
Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going?
We should be growing now!

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Try and visualize how to get it right
But my vision's so blurry
Trying to slow it down
Take us to the ground
But were always in a hurry now!
And if I could make this world spin a little slower
Then I would, and we could grow a little closer!
I think we’re getting closer!

[Hook x2: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
Why are we slowing?
We think we’re getting closer
Where are you going?
(Closer, closer, closer)
We should be growing now

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
So in conclusion
Sometimes we lose focus
Planning our whole demise
We’re getting the big picture and making it the wallet size
So to what's important in my life I apologize
I hope to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted
The question is would you bounce back, or bounce backwards?
You wouldn’t know how to act or would you take action?
That's just a part of life and if your vision's impaired
You'll probably lose it all tonight!

[Verse 2: Hope]
What’s going on Marvin, dearly departed?
Young Marta, Bar or Parker [?]
Upon them all upon mighty days
But sweet alcoholic nights are feeling faraway
Son can only Skype with his pop, stop
He’s only feeling love from his mom
Got rocks in my stomach
I can feel my soul bleed, self love
But I never want my son to be me, holla at me
So I pray until I feel it’s not working
I’m a showman on the surface
Either way it’s perfect
You ever feel like the purpose ain't worth it?
Well I do, I’m the poster child for young fathers working
I swear to god I wanna be free
And he just wanna be me
And I just wanna be him
I’m jealous and discreetly
I’m one of your own
I’m trying to raise a child
Still trying to raise me right now
Where am I gone?

[Bridge: Jhene Aiko]
Try and visualize how to get it right
But my visions are blurry
Trying to slow it down
Stay close to the ground
But we were always in a hurry now!
And if I could make this world spin a little slower
Then I would, and we could grow a little closer

[Outro: Jhene Aiko]
Where are we going?
Why?
Why are you going?
Why are we growing apart?
We should be growing together?
Right?
