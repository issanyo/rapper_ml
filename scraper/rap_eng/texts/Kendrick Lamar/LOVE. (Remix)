[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Damn, love or lust
Damn, all of us

[Chorus: Zacari (L.Leflore Jr.):]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
(Another world premiere!)
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Just love me, just love me, just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Love me
(I wanna be with you)
Love me, just love me

[Refrain: L.Leflore Jr. (Zacari)]
If my mind wasn’t this fucked up, would you still (love me)?
If I went out and commit a crime, would you still (love me)?
Keep it real, I'd rather have you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it for real, without you equals nothin’

[Verse 1 : L.Leflore Jr.]
Ay, I got somethin’
Hold up, tryna get the right words in
Okay...,baby I’m tryna be open but everybody is out here jokin’
I know you want me, I can tell by the way you’re smirkin’
I know you’re broken, I can tell that shit is hurtin’
But baby don’t worry, I’m here to take care of you
I’m here to make you smile something that nigga couldn’t do
It kinda been awhile, that a nigga had impress you
There’s a lot of girls in this crowd, but you’re the only one I find special
My bars are here to address you
Baby you’re a star, don’t ever let a nigga stress you
Let’s get in the car, cause  that’s the only way I can confess to you
Get to know you more while drivin’ cause later on tonight I’m tryna undress you
Open your car door, to show that I was raise right
Cause I know that’s gonna impress you
Baby, don’t think I’m here to play you
I’m actually here to stay with you
Pussy or not I can’t stay away from you

[Refrain: L.Leflore Jr. (Zacari)]
If my mind wasn’t this fucked up, would you still (love me)?
If I went out and commit a crime, would you still (love me)?
Keep it real, I'd rather have you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it for real, without you equals nothin’

[Chorus: Zacari (L.Leflore Jr.):]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Just love me, just love me, just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Love me
(I wanna be with you)
Love me, just love me

[Verse 2: L.Leflore Jr.]
Okay
I’m on the way
We ain’t got time to waste
Listen to the words i’ma say
That kitty I’m tryna taste
I do this shit everyday
You’re someone I ain’t scared to chase
She made me smile today, when I saw her pretty ass face
At the end of the day, my life was in a better place
She kinda blush today, when I had my hands around her waist
Yeah, I’m the kid with the “nigga naps” but also with the sweetest raps
Bars like Coles, attitude like Kenny
Lord I know, you’re always be with me
I got goals, so baby don’t be scared to achieve them with me
We all know, who’s really ridin’ with me
I wanna have somethin’ real, like Bobby and Whitney
I’m being for real, I feel that you’re the only one that gets me

[Refrain: L.Leflore Jr. (Zacari)]
If my mind wasn’t this fucked up, would you still (love me)?
If I went out and commit a crime, would you still (love me)?
Keep it real, I'd rather have you trust me than to (love me)
Keep it for real, without you equals nothin’

[Chorus: Zacari (L.Leflore Jr.):]
Give me a run for my money
There is nobody, no one to outrun me
So give me a run for my money
Sippin' bubbly, feelin' lovely, livin' lovely
Just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Just love me, just love me, just love me
(I wanna be with you, ay, I wanna be with)
Love me
(I wanna be with you)
Love me, just love me
