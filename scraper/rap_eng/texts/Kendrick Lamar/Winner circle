[Verse 1: Kanin]
Mama said, mama said, mama said
Boy you a star
Livin in a place with a bad mind state
Where a lot of good niggas don’t make it that far
Lot of good niggas didn’t lost they lives
These niggas didn’t lost they minds
For a piece of the pie
Everybody try to get rich fore they die
Uh, fuck any nigga tryna stop mines
Eject any nigga tryna waste time
Bitch you fuckin with a gifted mind
Eat these niggas like pork rinds
Fuck these hoes like one time
But bitch niggas ain’t one time
Seen this shit too many times
So I grab my balls, got on the grind
No I’m getting paid and livin life
Livin life in the winner circle
Cus I suffered much, suffered much
Cold world on color purple
Puffin on that color purple
Pockets green like Ninja Turtle
Turnt up when I’m off the herb
But jump through the hurdles when I use my verbals
Fuck you fake niggas talkin bout
Fuck these lame niggas lookin at?
I’m in a circle full of real niggas
And when I take this bitch you can’t have it back
It’s called hijack, hijack
TDE where the riders at
THC, we got pounds of that
Fuckin around in our circle, riders

[Hook x2]
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Life never did seem like it seen some life in me
Lights in the cloud that read, "Little nigga just use yo head you might can be
Just like Mike on the mic", Jordan
You’re recording more than twice a week
That’s not enough if you’re nice as thee Eminems
You mimic them legends but your work ethic is quite petite
Everything you like somehow retreat
From the page I’m so impatient
Pacin back and forth my sleeping pattern is getting badder than insomniacs
I’m a zombie at the studio, Can you ponder that?
I soon will blow like an arsonist
All I wanna do is be heard uh
All I ever do is strike nerves (Huh!)
A lot of fuck niggas and a lot of fuck bitches
That’s one thing that I observe (Uh!)
Cus when you doin you, everybody seem cool
Til you fuck around, get a blessing
And you look in the mirror, see the same old nigga
But everybody around you stressin'
I ain’t ask nobody for nothing
I went and got it my own nigga it’s nothin
And if you don’t condone or respect that
Then step back off my nuts nigga it’s fuck ya
I got a an appetite for more supper
And I lack advice for these suckers
And I sacrifice what I made, God bless my days while I’m in this circle
Ridin

[Hook x2]
We livin life in the winner circle
Ain’t no fake niggas allowed
We livin life in the winner circle
I’m gon make my mama proud
