[Intro]
Yeah
Punch what's happening brother?
Niggas be poppin' that shit to me like it's something new to me or something, I tell 'em bout
I tell a nigga quick, that shit just a rerun to me nigga
I've been doing this shit since vanguard[?] brother
Antonio what's happening with it?
Niggas hatin' on me but hop right on my dick soon as they see me
Soon as they see me they be like

[Verse 1]
What up Dot?
That's what they tell me every second around the clock
Every time I clock in, rappers checking they watch
Studio paid for, hours unlimited
Assholes, how many MCs I knock off they payroll
How many God MCs I knock off they halo
Hip-hop ain't dead, consumers changed up
Rappers love to see gold like the end of a rainbow
I stay low like my socks under my ankles
Play the back like a turtle shell, know well
That my team got me if I ever slack on my shit
So I fail, guess what? I don't even trip
Just like that, crush your little battle raps, punchlines
I did that in 99' you think it's a gold mine
When you think of one, you think you hot but I think you done
Like Queens New York slang, look what the killer brung
Machine guns to a fight, fucking right
Pay your bills or I'm turning out your lights, good night
I shatter niggas dreams, thinking they the West Coast kings
'Till I drop like visine
Tell a nigga quick it ain't always what it seems
Like the stitching on swap meet jeans
I'm itching to scratch a whack rapper, gun clapper
Snuff him like a rude capper, got a cool bladder, but I'm pissed off
At ya

[Hook]
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, (are you not entertained?)
Body any nigga that wanna holla' my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up

[Verse 2]
Nigga said he'd snatch my chain in the streets, what chain?
I barely wear jewelry, so I ever had one
You barely see it on me, and if I ever had a gun
You wouldn't know it's on me, so snatch it and then you done
I'm in the studio just sipping on Parmesan
Thinking about who could fuck with Kenny and parlor sons
I live this shit, try stop me, you won't live to shit
Probably catch four between your abdomen
Next time you see me, don't ask me who I'm collabing with
Between me and you, some of the new West is actresses
New hate activists, lowkey can't stand our shit
But still we continue to drink laxatives
Cold blooded, make the label hand me your budget
This is mine don't touch (pow pow), did I stutter?
Catch two, cats knew, I been a gorilla, welcome to the zoo
Yup, you little monkeys know what it do
Come test me

[Hook]
The real is back
Fuck the artificial, won't you let the realers rap
They scribble in they notebooks, me I state facts
Safe estate, they know where the best be at
Whenever I ask, (are you not entertained?)
Body any nigga that wanna holla' my name
And what, no cuts, this is Top Dawg gang
What the fuck, everybody else, pull your panties up

[Verse 3]
Dayum, you killin' 'em K-Dizzle
And if you don't kill 'em then you send 'em to hospitals
Sleeping on a reclined bed with a thin pillow
I'm with a white bitch, ass like a black widow
Bet I jumble to the end of my lifeline
So when I die, you can say I balled for a long time
The 08' Frankenstein, beast like Sasquatch
Feet size thirty-six, steppin on Hip-Hop cause that's my bitch
I write a rhyme, then she ride my dick
The girl is mine, I don't know that hoe that you with
You niggas know this, I'm way better than I've ever been
So focused, like a sniper when he zoom in
What's your motives? I bet it's to go against
Or like the GT get your bitch ass bit, all on these streets
I'm the all mighty K, Compton
Rep it 'till my very death day, let the reaper in his face
And recite every song from N.W.A
I pay homage for those great who paved the way
Wait, back to the subject of who's and who doesn't
Do what I do, bluffin' until I touch 'em
Like a masseuse do, nothing compares to me
But the throne, so tell 'em bring the chair to me
I'm a red bullet, small nigga
But I handle y'all niggas like I'm eight feet tall
Nigga
