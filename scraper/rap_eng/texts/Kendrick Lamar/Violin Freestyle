[Kendrick Lamar]
I'm on Union Square
Kendrick Lamar, violin, we take it there
Me and my man, no one compare
That's like two left shoes, you fools
I'm so rude, my flow is so crude
Spit at the mouth, foam and drool
I'm on top of the world, I'm on my pedestal
Looking under your girl's dress - now that's a mess
Lift my flows like I flip your wife
And pass it to Sounwave down the way
You know he's nice
ADHD, producer, recruit ya
To the armies ?
Take a nigga to war
You know how I'm about to settle the score
Kendrick, Ramal spelled backwards
Come and get me, you're nothing but target practice
You're actors, coming at you with my flows
Like acrobatics. You never can stride into Compton
You get stomped on, what is you're talking about?
You don't want none..
