[Verse 1: Dr. Dre]
It's still Dre Day nigga, AK nigga
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How nigga?
My last album was The Chronic
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed
They wanna know how I feel about it

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
It's Alive

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Still puffing my leafs
Still fuck with the beats, still not loving police
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease
Still got love for the streets, repping 213
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left ain't too much changed

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I done grew up 'round some people living their life in bottles
Granddaddy had the golden flask backstroke every day in Chicago
Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
That I'mma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I rap with a Pyrex
In the projects
I'm crack in a pot
I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate
On a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no key in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, ah
