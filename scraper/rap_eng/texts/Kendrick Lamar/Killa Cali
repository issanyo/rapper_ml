[Intro]
I know about killa California
Badmon no fear fi haunt ya
But we no care about not a thing at all
No if it kill, we buss ya boy

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
When I leave the house, I can't forget the weapon
Been through more shootouts than Hot 97
Equipped with the black Mac 11
Ain't no half steppin', Watts what I'm reppin'
Pull up, whip same color as fire
Obesity rims, anorexic tires
Bob Marley in the Swisher, I gotta get higher
The Grim Reaper handin' out tickets like flyers
Crips killin' Crips, Bloods killin' Bloods
Thats how it is now in Killa Cali, bruh
You gotta stay strapped, homie, never slip up
Bullets love skin, you'll get that ass touched
I glide through the streets, gat in my lap
One under the seat, K in the trunk like who want it with me?
Don't make it to trauma, you'll lying in sheets
We the last of a dying breed

[Hook]
I know about killa California
Badmon no fear fi haunt ya
But we no care about not a thing at all
No if it kill, we buss ya boy
Bo bo buss a shot for your area
Bo bo buss a shot for your area
Rah rah buss a shot for your area
Cause we no scared of yah

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm from the city where they concentrate on nothin'
But that red flag, blue flag, gang bang, murder state
Elementary kids liable they catch a case
So don't be surprised if a ten year old put one in your face
Kick in your door then put it to your face
Shake you up a little bit then ask you where the safe
Streets ain't safe and so I got the toolie on me
Movin' like a Mario brother, pardon me brother
But you gon' have to come out that whip, your mama might love ya but
I'm lovin' what's on your wrist, I'm lovin' what's on your neck
I'm lovin' what's in your head rest
You might as well give it to me or or be in peace with the rest deceased
Dippin' in lanes, duckin', dodgin' police
After we get away we celebrate over chronic tree
Who did you think rollin' with me?
K-Dot, Compton, visit my streets

[Hook]
I know about killa California
Badmon no fear fi haunt ya
But we no care about not a thing at all
No if it kill, we buss ya boy
Bo bo buss a shot for your area
Bo bo buss a shot for your area
Rah rah buss a shot for your area
Cause we no scared of yah

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Rock welcomes you to Killa Killa Cali
Thi-thi-this the murder capi' where them boys trigger happy
Concrete jungle, tell me who barrell a sparrow
It don't matter, we ghetto gotta gotta stack bundles
Don't matter the weather, man you gotta keep Berettas
Bullets rainin' like showers, they kill for money and power
Man that's murder murder get murdered at any hour
Any minute and any second I'm standin' tall as a tower
Ghetto strong survive, the weak get swallowed, devoured
Sorry there's no love for no cowards, if you one that's a problem
If you got a problem, we'll solve it for you, partner, no problem
If I can't reach you then my little homies got 'em
Niggas up on the hustle moving packs of that powder
Plus these bitches ain't shit, man it's all about a dollar
Bust a shot for my area with those 40 calibers
You gotta be a leader, got no respect for followers
