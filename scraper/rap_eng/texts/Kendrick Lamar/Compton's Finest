[Verse 1: HOPE]
I’m a Nestor Ave  tibby rock thrower
Nightlife liver, still waiting to throw up
25 cents, Now & Later, and a soda
Snotty-nosed kids slap boxing on the corner
Yeah, that’s me right there
Sandy little Jordans and the swoosh in his hair
In the overall shorts, I ain’t have a care in the world
Contact, ‘cause my call right there
I thought I was Pac when ‘Hit ‘Em Up’ came out
Got in trouble for the music, I was playin’ it loud
Read the credits to all the CDs in the house
With the [?] bottle I was rockin’ the crowd
I was eight when I wrote my first rap line down
Shit, I remember, I was right on the couch
Are you feeling me? Back in third grade I was killing it
If y’all don’t get the metaphor, it’s all elementary
Summertime fun, mack daddy at the pool
Wintertime fun, selling candy at the school
Ready for the action, if it happened, I was cool
I ain’t see ‘em, if you do, tell my daddy I’m a fool, Kendrick

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick Lamar, plain old Kendrick the Average Joe
But not the average flow, just willing to make it, ock
That boy’s bacon, he got relations with Satan, Pops
This type of greatness is well-awaiting the fatal shots
Now what you know about them Westside streets?
We was five like deep, rapping the best of Mobb Deep
Rapping my best in my sleep, that’s if I ever slept
Countin’ bars while you countin’ sheep, you lookin’ at the best
God-given, I’m been spitting since Pokémon cards and yo-yos
Sauconies Girbaud jeans, when Wayne made “bling-bling” I was hip-hopping
Makin’ ‘em hop, have a pogo
Let’s get this cream, cold stones
I’m fallin’ off, hold on
When peeling off, BMX bikes
Ducking shots that was barking real DMX-like
A pizza and a cold Sprite
Peace to the world
I close my door and make love to the beat
Then fuck your girl
That was K.Dot then

[Verse 3: HOPE]
Top-tier, I’m here, they call me King Hope
With a mean flow dancing for the team, ock
Street hop from the bottom, we on the street’s top
It’s all scenic, believe it, you’ll get your bean popped

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
I give you my album in replacement of Detox
I drop shit with ease to let y’all eavesdrop
On my style, eyes of an owl as they watch
Throw in that towel or get thrown in a ditch

[Verse 5: HOPE]
Or get thrown on the pit, I was thrown on stages
Tab, Centennial, Westchester lacing
My flow ’96, your flow ‘06
Your flow “eh, cool…”, my flow “oh shit!”

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
You flow don’t exist, we co-exist with the UFOs
Goddamnit, stranded on planets that you don’t know
The aliens panic, pack they bags, they hit the road
The truth, the phone booth, the greatness take its toll
