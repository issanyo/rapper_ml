[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm lookin' at the flashy lights and wonder - the price and number
Enticed by the glamorous ice, I wanna
Unite with the Hollywood twice, my concert'll look like yours
And I wanted more than I could ever imagine, even a kicked-down door
So you can hear that I'm rapping, see, I can hear "encore"
Struck by the fame bug, been fightin' the same drug
The feelin' that caned us in vain, it's tough love

Tough love - please help me, please help me
I'm on my knees, please help me, need you to tell me
Ain't nothing' bigger than you, I thought a Benz would do
But nothin' bigger than you, ain't nothin' bigger than truth
And truth be told, the totem pole
Of non-believers just made the cattle blow
But I can see ya, even when my vision's impaired
Many moons away, but still you're right here

[Verse 1: Emeli Sandé]
You won’t find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice or staying out ’til three
You won’t ever find him be unfaithful
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
You won’t find him tryna chase the devil
For money, fame, for power out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Chorus 1]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Verse 2]
When the money’s spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can’t seem to find no help or love for free
I know there’s no need for me to panic
Cause I’ll find him, I’ll find him next to me
When the skies are grey and all the doors are closing
And the rising pressure makes it hard to breathe
When all I need’s a hand to stop the tears from falling
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

[Chorus 2]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
I will find him, I’ll find him next to me

[Bridge]
When the end has come and buildings falling down fast
When we’ve spoilt the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

[Chorus 1]
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me

Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
Next to me – wooh hooo
You will find him, you’ll find him next to me
