[Hook]
Down... When You Could Be.. taking me... down!

[Verse 1: Kent]
Hell nah, hell nah
You got me fucked up like Jim Bean
And your second toe is bigger than your big toe
Chillin in the studio high, puma clydes resting on knees
She keep bbm'ing me get home but I'mma fucking G
Girl please
You ain't even my girlfriend quit
That type of shit gets you kicked out the in crowd quick
Two fingers together just like yo legs I make em split
She said I'm broke. And Hopeless
Yo best friend lemme hit DEST
Last laugh, watch me stack cash
Since you won't let me work file transfer some pictures of that ass
More Kush and wine
Waking up next to two dimes
I smoke one and poke one
They both hell as fine

[Verse 2: Joon]
Well I scooped her up like a spoon
Told her I'm June
Good if ya nasty
But I be on my grind so ya can't see me all the time, but when I come baby, I come DEEP,like the trail of tears baby
You understand me?
They told me you stingy if you smoking on anything that's less than a dime
And you miccy if you pokin anything that's less than 9
You live in LA!! and I know In you I found something special
We connect so many levels
But endeavors for the cheddar got me bed-less and you the wettest
I really wish I could be there I wouldn't be jus trynna pull yo leggings
Cause you know my every fetish
And what I love to eat breakfast
And it damn well eggs it ain't Even on the nobody's checklist
BUT MINE
I'll be there in the blink of an eye girl quite whining
Lemme get these dollars

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Sleezy]
Everyday we back and fourth with the same discussion
Say I act like you ain't nothin
Girl you buggin thought we had it clear I ain't tryna be yo husband
Them feelings got you wishin it was Somethin that it wasn't
Why you spazz when you here I'm in the club from yo cousin?
But she ain't tell you she was on me too she be frontin
Man I really shoulda done it, let her blow me like a trumpet
But you be bitchin cuz these bitches in yo ear bumpin gums like
"why he always in the studio?!"
Got me feeling guilty I ain't even in the mood to flow
Damn you so predictable sending text wit ya flesh exposed now I'm ret to go
When I see that ass girl bets believe its goin down

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
My woman be trippin sometimes
I remember her strippin off martin and sipping on some of the cheapest of wine
Which way we gone climb? I'm tryna get higher but you desire land mines, Blow Up
Every time I'm, In Clubs tryna network my social
Life like I'm supposed to but I'm wrong
To you I'm very wrong, but you don't get it, and you won't admit it you say I'm like your ex but I think were nothing different
She gave me them digits
But I didn't call, I put that on me
And yo girlfriends, I know they throw salt like Angelina Jolie, now let's see
I'll be gone til Wednesday, gotta show in Portland
Now my baby, say I ain't her baby
But more of an abortion I'm like that's crazy
I bought that Lexo, and sat it on Jordans
Now miss lady, if promoters don't pay me
Then we can't afford it
Forging signatures on fake check
It ain't life if I don't break sweat
To break these mics on every set
It's ironic I'm Tryna stay grounded at the same time still fly these jets
Hello, goodbye marro rodeo
It's funny you had a great, but still you took ungrateful

Chorus
