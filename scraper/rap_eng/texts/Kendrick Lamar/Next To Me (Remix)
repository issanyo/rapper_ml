[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm looking at the flashy lights and wonder - the price and number
Enticed by the glamorous ice, I wanna
Unite with the Hollywood twice, my concert'll look like yours
And I wanted more than I could ever imagine, even a kicked-down door
So you can hear that I'm rapping, see, I can hear "encore"
Struck by the fame bug, been fighting the same drug
The feeling that caned us in vain, it's tough love

[Verse 2: Emeli Sande]
You won't find him drinking under tables
Rolling dice and staying out 'till 3
You won't ever find him being unfaithful
You will find him, you'll find him next to me
You won't find him trying to chase the devil
For money, fame, for power, out of greed
You won't ever find him where the rest go
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

[Hook: Emeli Sande]
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
Next to me, ooh
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

[Verse 3: Emeli Sande]
When the money's spent and all my friends have vanished
And I can't seem to find no help or love for free
I know there's no need for me to panic
Cause I'll find him, I'll find him next to me

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Tough love - please help me, please help me
I'm on my knees, please help me, need you to tell me
Ain't nothing bigger than you, I thought a Benz would do
But nothing bigger than you, ain't nothing bigger than truth
Truth be told, they tolled and polled
Of non-believers just made the cattle blow
But I can see ya, even when my vision's impaired
Many moons away, but still you're right here

[Hook]

[Verse 5: Emeli Sande]
When the end has come, the buildings falling down fast
When we spoiled the land and dried up all the sea
When everyone has lost their heads around us
You will find him, you'll find him next to me

[Hook]
