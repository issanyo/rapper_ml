[Intro]
Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seasons change
There's still time for us to run away
Seasoâ€”

[Verse 1: Sjava]
San'bonan endlini
USjava kaJama Indlalifa igama ley'nsizwa
Mina, ng'phuma le enzansi, kwafel ubala
Insizwa uma ina-thirty five, kthiwa is' indala
Laph' eng'phuma khona maw'phuma khona bathi aw'fiki la
Ngyamangala, uma ngi-la
Bebathi ng'yophelel emoyeni
Beba right, manje ngiy'nkanyezi
Njengoba ngik'tshela ngempilo yami
Ng'funa uthathe nayi imfundiso yami (lalela la wena)
Ithemba alibulali
Ukube l'yabulala ngabe nihamba phez'kwami

[Chorus: Sjava]
Poverty, jealousy, negativity
Ngith' ak'nandawo la
Go away (far away)
Poverty, jealousy, negativity
Ngith' ak'nandawo la
Go away (far away)

[Verse 2: Mozzy]
I cried when lil' bruh died
Got high and watched the sunrise
Wiggle on 'em if it's one time
They done hung all of my people
I love all of my people
I'm in the slums with all of my people
They tryna tell us that we all equal
We get no justice so it ain't peaceful, yeah
They can bluff you, they can beat you
Paid attorney, we gon' need it
Momma told me there was demons
And she ain't never lied on her Jesus'
She worked her ass off just to feed us
She went to Ross to cop the new Adidas
She used to tap in with all the teachers
They wasn't teachin' nothin', it's no secret
Whole lotta crime, lil' niggas beefin'
We gotta keep it or end up a victim
Trapped in the system, traffickin' drugs
Modern-day slavery, African thugs
We go to war for this African blood
We go to war for this African blood
When I put niggas on, it was all out of love
You was disloyal, can't call it no love

[Chorus: Sjava]
Poverty, jealousy, negativity
Ngith' ak'nandawo la
Go away (far away)

[Verse 3: Reason]
(Season change) You know we off the stove with it
We stove whippin', niggas know we gon' get it
(Season change) Dodgin' cops
Fuck around and get locked, you ain't never comin' home with it
Look, my nigga, I came from the sewer
Don't shit on my past, you ain't come from manure
You see Reason and you see LA
But bitch I ain't come for no ruin
Just know all of my niggas, we struggled for it
Had to hustle for it, cried puddles for it
My pops watched his sister get locked for it
I done seen my niggas get knocked for it like {gunshot}
Gimme that, I carry Del Amo like a piggyback
I carry my city like guilt that ain't got no forgiveness
No way out, shit we locked in the system
Catch a case and they not gon' forgive ya
White skin, you be out before Christmas
Shit, auntie missed eight of those days
Tears from me, had to pray those days
Had to slave those days
Shit, we had to hit up a couple hood giveaways those days
Thank God for every inch that he gave us
Thank God for everything cause he made us
Like when that car bent the block, blat blat
Hit the homie but we made it to ER and he saved us
Thinkin' that he could've died, nigga
We was prayin' to the sky and his momma cried rivers
Healed up, but tough luck, he tried to get revenge
Had to drop, bullets popped and they killed him
Worst part is that it sound so familiar

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I am T'Challa, I am Killmonger
One world, one God, one family
