Dropped 40 for a Glock 40 that's a hood discount
That's an accessory gun, sesemy seed buns
For the beef y'all brung, y'all done fucked up
Fucked with the wrong fuck up
I've been a nut since pops fucked moms
Fucked up in the head, I'm living, but I'm brain-dead
Life goes on and you don't need a psychic in order to read my palm
Niggas'll get you first where I'm from
That's why I Creep on 'em, I creep on 'em, I creep on 'em
Niggas play cool, put the heat on 'em
Make the temperature reach the highest peak on 'em

I said you don't need a pyschic in order to read my palm
