[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yo, if you could see what I was thinking --
You'd probably see a boat floating in my quotes
Fluid like sewer drain, too insane --
Like everything Edgar Allan Poe wrote
Call the Olympics, I can't even spit it -- I pole-vault
And your team's like making love for the slowpokes
Here we go though -- Soul got a blunt rolled up
Chocolate Thai got me right, yeah I Cocoa Puff --
Time to time? Shit, I'm high all day
Like the sun, you could catch me in the sky all day
Money like pre-algebra -- multiply all day
My style cayenne pepper so I spit like Dylan
Whenever the mic gone --
Got sick and tired of asking for shit to write on
Now the only pen that I grip --
Exists in my cerebral cortex
The future is like a quartet -- I fore-see it bitch

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
You know I'd really hate to murder you rappers -- (really though)
I wish I never heard of you rappers -- (really though)
Shit's whack man you need more practice -- (really though)
So go practice --
Go practice

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
Shit -- my impact is flammable gaseous in a room full of lit matches
Rumor has it I'm hazardous --
Rap Lazarus, the hip hop Jesus of Nazareth
Polaroid couldn't capture this
I'm candidating like an activist, back to this
I'm profound, you niggas lost like Angeles
I'm fierce like a wildebeest --
Built like a million-piece puzzle
Put together by hustle, who wanna scuffle?
We laugh to the bank and you chuckle -- keep the change
My genetic makeup's too different to be the same as y'all
Like sending instant messages when I aim at y'all --
I'm hitting you up
Like graffiti on the wall, hope you get what you ask for
As for Ab-Soul, I'm a asshole -- that's all
Shut them down like Ctrl - Alt - Delete, capisce?

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Mind-boggling, word gargling word-ologist
What you hollerin'?
I got enough spit to form my very own island, my friend
Wanna take a swim?
Step into the booth, you'll probably need a bathing suit
Skinny-dipping, my thoughts inside a pool of sharks do
You hesitate to test the waters of a fish tank
You first-timer -- You need more than one-liners
Your color scheme is undone, all you have is the primer
Paint pictures like art designers --
Architect when I often draw the tech
Then put your carcass over your set when the words eject
Celibacy flow --
Really don't matter the sex, just letting you know --
Women could get it quicker like chlamydia nigga
Disease-infested, please consider --
The piece of her comprehension inside my jurisdiction
And you can't deliver

[Verse 4: Punch]
If you could see my thoughts I recollect in the booth --
Self genocide rhyme, hang yourself from the noose --
To spit iodine from a spectator's view
Punch is off his rocker, locked in Davy Jones' locker
Un-controllable urge to splurge on the verse
Baptize them with the words, shall return as the first
Born immaculate birth, dog, cuz what I'm worth --
Is the earth's first garden and that's only when I'm starvin' nigga
Yeah...I'ma stop right there
K-Dot, Ab-Soul, Punch
Murder you rappers
