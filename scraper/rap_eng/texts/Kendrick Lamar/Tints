[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
I been feelin' kinda cooped up, cooped up
I’m tryna get some fresh air
Hey, why you got the roof off, roof off?
You know it never rains here
Hey, you ain't gotta flash when you takin' your picture
You ain’t gotta draw no extra attention
Paparazzi wanna shoot ya, shoot ya
Niggas dyin' for less, out hear

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryna throw a bag in a safe
Giggin', tourin', chorin', raisin' babes
Baby Milo wants some Bathing Apes
Niggas crying for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rear view mirror

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I can't be ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I can’t be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
And it’s no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You probably think a nigga trollin’ (Like)
Or showin' out for the cameras (Right)
Fuck I'm doin' fish-bowlin’? ('Side)
One hunnid thou' on the passenger
Bitch, I'm Kendrick Lamar, respect me from afar
I was made in His image, you call me a god
Everybody in attendance, I'm about to perform
Everybody get offended by the shit I got on
Like, can you buy that, nigga?
Nine hunnid horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
(I need tint) 'Cause bomb head is non-disclosure
(I need tint) So I can live with a peace of mind
Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and not do fines, so fuck a fix-it ticket
You pull me over and might see one of your bitches, ahh!

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)

[Verse 3: Anderson .Paak]
You know I like it presidential (Presidential)
Stretch it out, that's a limo (That's a limo)
Pull it over, let me get behind ya ('Hind ya)
Where we goin', they don't need to know (Don't need to know)
Ghost ridin' in the Phantom (In the Phantom?)
Niggas never see me comin' (Uh, superstar)
She wanna hold me like a ransom (Uh, bitch, I don't know you)
But the money keep me runnin' (Uh, but the money)

[Pre-Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryna throw a bag in a safe
Giggin', tourin', chorin', raisin' babes
Baby Milo wants some Bathing Apes
Niggas crying for less out here
Do what I gotta do bruh, do bruh
Get up in my rear view mirror

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)
I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick
I need tints (Windows tinted)
I need tints (I need my windows tinted)

[Outro: Anderson .Paak & Tayla Parx]
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming, no, no
I, I think I'm 'bout to black out
Can't see me when I act out tonight
I got some moves I gotta make though
I got the goons up on the payroll
They won't see me coming
They won't see me coming

[Physical Version Skit: Anderson .Paak & [?]]
(As soon as I put this on, yeah, ooh)
(Yeah, as soon as I put this on)
God damn, what?
(Don't fight it, let it live)
Shit, what's up man?
Bubblin'! I see you my nigga!
Oh, thank you bro!
Ay, bro, I don't know if you- anybody ever told you this, you need to start sellin' bubble baths
Ah

That's extra, bro. That's extra. You gotta chill, bro, you gotta chill
Whatchu mean I gotta chill, bro? Why are you rollin' yo windows up?
Just be- just be yourself
Bro, lemme get 30 dollars!
Ay, you got some lotion?
