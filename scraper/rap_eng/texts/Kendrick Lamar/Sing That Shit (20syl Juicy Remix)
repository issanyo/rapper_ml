Now everybody sing that shit
[Sampled from "The Game â€“ The City"]

[Verse 1 - Kendrick Lamar]
Johnny always lock a nigga down
Knowing damn well we don't wanna see the box like Manny Pacquiao
Little nigga Mayweather size, ride like Pac
In his prime, thug life is now on radar
Til the federal come through and raid ours
Reminiscing when the LA Raiders
Was in my home, snapback fitted on my uncle's dome
[X4]
Snapback fitted
Snapback fitted
Snapback fitted
On my uncle's dome
And I don't condone dickriding, I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
"Compton!", a nigga gotta scream that shit
Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit[X2]
Can't block or
Can't block or
Can't block or
Screen that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit

[Hook]
Now everybody sing that shit

[Outro]
I'm addicted to
Westsiding, living in a city where the skinny niggas die
And the semi bullets fly, but it turn me to a lion
Trying, and I mean that shit
Game came through, put the city on his back
I was in the city with a nigga, had seen that shit
Scream that shit
Never went commercial, never T.V. screened that shit
Can't block or screen that shit[X2]
Can't block or
Can't block or
Can't block or
Screen that shit
Can't block or screen that shit
Now everybody sing that shit
