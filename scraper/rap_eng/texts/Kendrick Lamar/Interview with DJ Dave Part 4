Oh, okay, okay. I understand that. Okay, now, for uhh people who don't know, where'd you grow up at, man? Like, you know, what type of city. What area?

[Kendrick Lamar]
Uhh, Compton. Straight Compton. No sides. No - just - niggas used to roll down Rosecrans, we used to be bumpin' that - pops used to be bumpin' that NWA shit. And, uh, shit - you know, "cruise down that street in my 6-4." We wasn't in no 6-4 though. We was in the brown dukie van and shit, same color as dukie

(laughs)

Know what I'm talkin' bout? But uh, yeah, we'd bump that shit all day

[DJ Dave]
Oh, okay. And what influenced you to become, you know, a rapper?

[Kendrick Lamar]
You know, the typical person would say, uh, "other rappers." I'mma be straight up honest, when I found out I was dope - Next question...
