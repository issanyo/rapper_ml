[Intro]
Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that you raised him from the dead
I will ask that Jesus will come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior
I receive Jesus to take control of my life
And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus' name, Amen

[Verse 1]
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
"Hello, my name is Kendrick," she said "No, you're handsome."
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now
"Cool, where you stay?"
She said: "Down the street from Dominguez High"
Okay, I know that's borderline Compton or Paramount
"Well, is it Compton?" – "No," she replied
And quickly start battin' her eyes
And strictly had wanted her thighs around me
Seventeen, with nothin' but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful
"What you tryin' to get into?"
She didn't tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and well

[Verse 2]
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin' her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin' her
Who could imagine? Maybe my actions will end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless we'll fuck, 'cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein' young and dumb
Is never muted; in fact, it's much louder where I'm from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius's irrepetible
Family history of gang bangin' did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
I wanna come over, what's up?
That's what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I'm tryin' to get off
I was in heat like a cactus, my tactics of bein' thirsty
Probably could hurt me, but fuck it, I got some heart
Grab my momma's keys, hopped in the car, then oh boy

[Verse 3]
So now I'm down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope 'cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin' about that sex, thinkin' about her thighs
Or maybe kissin' on her neck, or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties blowin' up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she's a masseuse
And I'm a professional porn star when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I'm hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke Anthem
I'm two blocks away, 250 feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin' me 'cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze and my phone rang

[Outro]
Please leave your message for 323-
Record your message after the tone
Kendrick, where you at?
Damn! I'm sittin' here waitin' on my van
You told me you was gon' be back in fifteen minutes!

Plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain’t gon' pass to the next grade, 11th grade
(Is that Kendrick on the phone?)
Yo' daddy hollerin' about some damn dominoes
He want to holler at you too
Go 'head, Kenny, go! Shit
(Hello? Yeah, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?)

This man fussin' about some damn dominoes

Shit, I'ma miss my damn appointment! Fuck!

Nobody wanna hear yo' ass!
Matter of fact, cut my motherfuckin' oldies back on
