[Verse 1]
I wrote this record while 30 thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm a terrorist, eat my asparagus
Then I'm asking her thoughts of a young nigga, fast money and freedom
A crash dummy for dollars, I know you dying to meet 'em
I'll prolly die in a minute, just bury me
With 20 bitches, 20 million, and a Comptown fitted

[Hook]
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)
Hold up (Hold up)

[Bridge]
Yeah, big shit popping, Section.80

[Verse 2]
Back in this bitch in the back of that bitch, with my back against the wall
And your bitch on the edge of my dick, jump-off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that I'm easily peddling with the speed
Of a lightning bolt, as a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my 20's at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like '87
Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From the distance, don't know which one is a Christian... damn
Who can I trust in 2012? There's no one not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Yeah, big shit popping, everybody watching
When you do it like this, nigga, losing ain't a option

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Yeah, big shit popping
Ay, ay, kick her out the studio, Ali

[Verse 3]
24/7 nigga, working his ass for it, she popping that ass for it
The King of Diamonds with diamonds I never do ask for
They checking my passport, I'm too accustomed with Customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff 'em
They want me to fast-forward the game, and why you complain
When you niggas is past poor, you'll never hop in my lane
When you pushing a RAV4, you wrecking my Jaguar
You play like a bad sport, her feet on the dashboard

[Hook + Bridge + Hook]

[Bridge]
Yeah, big shit popping, everybody watching
When you do it like this, nigga

[Outro]
I wrote this record while 30 thousand feet in the air
Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair
If I can fuck her in front of all of these passengers
They'll probably think I'm Osama
The plane emergency landed: it was an honor, hold up
