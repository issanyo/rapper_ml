[Verse 1]
K-Dot, Kendrick Lamar, got mad heart
Come from Compton, I spit straight heart
Got my hood on for Trayvon Martin
Freedom, justice, you know we gon' be started
Get the party started every time we come through flippin'
Flamin' Hot Cheetos I'm eatin'
I'm skippin' across L.A., that's somethin' that we do
Each and every day, hangin' with my crew
Throw another word, watch how I observe the train
Matter of face, where's my girl, Sherane
And when I say "train", that don't means that I flip her
Yeah, we did toss, turn just like Flipper
My favorite cartoon, you know
Got to go with Bugs Bunny Cartoon Show
Tiny Toon Adventures, Dennis the Menace
I'm a menace, I spit, break the World of Guinness
When I'm flowin', you never know, I need another word
Give me nouns and verbs, what I spit is absurd
The Finals, the Heat, yeah, they came with the Heat
LeBron, Wade, no, they can't be defeat
I stay in the shade, I'm in the darkness, I'm hot though
Another word, homie, you give me what you got
Who kills my vibe? The haters, the groupies
The Hoovers in the streets, they try to shoot me
I move with heat, you never can stop me
I come from Compton, (?)
The best strip club, it's down Atlanta, it's down Miami
I stay with the (?), I say, "What's up, shawty?"
You got your girl, I don't like fake ass, I need a referral
I see everybody twerkin'
Even Miley Cyrus got that motherfucker workin'
You can never stop me, The Rickey Smiley Show
I'm here, I'm here, I'm lettin' people know
The better celebrity female in the game
I like Rihanna, who else could complain?
I love, I can't even say the word
But I'm cussin' and I don't need to pronounce a verb
The Black Hippy is the crew, we do what we do
We stay in the booth, we do it, we shoot
We straight for the stars, you know just who we ares
We ride in Buicks, then we pushin' the flashy cars
I'm a flow all day, this The Rickey Smiley Show
Just to let you know, we still 'bout to go
They bring me in, they show love with the crew
Rickey Smiley Show, huh, you know what it do, what's up?
