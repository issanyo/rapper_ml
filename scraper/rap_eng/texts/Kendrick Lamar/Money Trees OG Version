[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish (ya bish)
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish? (ya bish)
Home invasion was persuasive (was persuasive)
From nine to five I know it’s vacant, ya bish (ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool (they wasn’t cool)
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros (tell my bros)
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on ("Let Burn" came on)
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish (ya bish)
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (ya bish)
The only thing we had to free our mind (free our mind)
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs (see dollar signs)
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish (ya bish)
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish (ya bish)
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew (we never knew)
Go at a reverend for the revenue

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That’s just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That’s just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That’s just how I feel

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
Bump that new E-40 after school (way after school)
You know, “Big Ballin' With My Homies” (my homies)
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational (thinkin’ rational)
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish (ya bish)
Another casualty at war, ya bish (ya bish)
Two bullets in my Uncle Tony head (my Tony head)
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish (ya bish)
That Louis Burger never be the same (won't be the same)
A Louis belt will never ease that pain (won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (that day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin' (Pirellis skirtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (a pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

[Bridge: Anna Wise]
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Uh, What's on a young niggas mind ya bish (ya bish)
Benjamin's and killing time ya bish (ya bish)
The quickest way to make the quickest pay (the quickest pay)
Even if it's doing crime ya bish (ya bish)
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do (like rappers do)
But for now I guess this sack will do (this sack will do)
They told 'em money the root of all evil (that's all evil)
He hugged the devil the moment he seen 'em

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(The one in front of the gun, forever)
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel
