Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5
When I kick it, I kick it as if the beat was my enemy
You have thought it was tender me on point like a widow P
Got that leverly give them dearies that do what it do
Payin a picture like duderline, you ain't shit but do do
In the city where see me get pointed that damn it you
You can hide, you get it if you want to
I do karate moves but the crushing tiger just might get broken down by a writer
Yeah the passenger hopped out
But you got shot by the driver
There's a killer like everywhere
So why would you take it there
Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a banker you
Tell me f*ck you I'll tell you f*ck you back with my index finger
I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool
Keep it sober minded try not to be a p**sy like you
Nigga that kale cold attack, Cali on my back till my torso break nigga
This is where it's at that's gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta x 5
I'm so malicious I blow your wicked
Make em close as stigiuos, hells kitchen I'm blowing dishes
This is spoken wisdom as I journey a poe and mission
I'ma lift it, my flow is gift it
She cold with a bow and ribbon the role of riches
Low the bisquits let's go to distance
I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broken mission
They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions
Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
Call adrenaline I got this soul like a poe living
And.like I'm co-existent to prohibition
I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
Mother of statistics they rap with metaphysics
And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition
Show some recognition hold your .my pessimistic
Best that ever did it, Papoose is the definition
