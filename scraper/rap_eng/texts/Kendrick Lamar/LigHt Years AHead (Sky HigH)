[Verse 1]
The ground risin' (Uh), the sun fallin'
My day is cool (Cool), my night's yawnin'
Uh, ain't nothing else to do but—
Move at the speed of light! Aye! I'm takin' flight (Uh)
Yeah, NASA left behind (Huh)
I'm so beyond, somewhere with Megatron
I'm super gone, you can't relate to him
And, um, let me free my mind (Ooh)
Uh, I see it all (All)
The galaxy, she want my all (All)
Uh, feel like it's child's play (Aye)
Now through a Milky Way (Aye), fulfill my destiny
As I cooperate (-rate) my record plays (Plays)
My record spins, nigga; whirlwind
Yeah, I see it all;
Become a star—tryna shine through the fall
Ah

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
See you in the mornin'
Take off, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high
Going, going, goin'
Up there, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high
I'm sky high
Nigga, I'm sky high
See you in the mornin'
Going, going, goin'

[Verse 2]
The ground risin' (Yeah), the moon fallin'
My night's cool (Cool), my day's yawnin'
Uh, ain't nothing else to do but—
Move at the speed of light (Aye!)
We travel like a comet, supersonic, just watch out for God, accelerate
Movin' at the speed of light ain't no thoughts of me usin' brakes (Uh)
Inhalin' gravity, excel the Hubble
Check my levels, check my levels, turn me up, turn me up
What the fuck? (Ooh) Got your bitch, she on my nuts, on my nuts (Huh)
All because a nigga cool, man, I swear she act a fool
Man, you know I keep it real (Real)—man, for reals (Reals)
Man, you know I'm super ills (Ills), went to Pluto gave it chills
Man, I swear, need no appeals (-peal), risin' from my heels
With no ceiling' or a ground, prolly never comin' down
Yeah, I see it all (All);
Become a star (Star)—tryna shine through the fall (Fall)
Ah

[Hook]
See you in the mornin'
Take off, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high
Going, going, goin'
Up there, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high
I'm sky high
Nigga, I'm sky high
See you in the mornin'
Going, going, goin'


[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
My turbo boostin', my jetpack cruisin'
Get jet lag when I come back to these fuckin' humans
I could put planet Earth in a canister
Then continue my crater search, with Captain Kirk
Look at my verse, you seein' signs?
You hearin' signals deciphered from District 9
No fuckin' rapper-cypher when meteors flyin'
The meters are flyin' but I'm way faster
Run away bet I catch ya, fire like striking matches
I'm higher with martians laughin' in spaceships as stars is crashin'
Hover above the masses, a massive attack we're mixin'
Kendrick Lamar with magic, pull rabbits from hats—
Niggas—wanna hop on track—bitches—wanna hop on dick—
"Damn! Is that a fuckin' blimp?! No, O-M-G, that's him!"
A shootin' star hangin' over a new eclipse
Hangin' over a big dip, when my music flip, nigga, I'm sky high
Shit

[Hook]
See you in the mornin'
Take off, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high
Going, going, goin'
Up there, nigga, I'm time zonin'—tell 'em I'm sky high
I'm sky high
Nigga, I'm sky high
See you in the mornin'
Going, going, goin'
