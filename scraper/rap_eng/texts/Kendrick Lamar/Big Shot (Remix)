[Intro]
Wakanda, welcome

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Big shot (hol' up, wait) peanut butter insides (no)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot, big shot, (hol' on, hol' on), peanut butter insides (hol' on)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Sir Duckworth or Kung-Fu Kenny
Got juice, got work, got weight, got plenty
Got them, got her, got more, got Benji (yeah)
Top off, gettin' topped-off in the city
Big Top Dawg and I dance on 'em like Diddy
Pop off and I pop back like Fiddy (yeah)
I hit the ceiling and forgot about the floor (yeah)
Brand so big, got my haters on the ropes (yeah)
This be the wave, plus I live on the coast (yeah)
When I touch a bag, young nigga do the most (yeah)
Mmm, woo, and I Wakanda flex (yeah)
And you know what time it is (yeah)
But don't know what grindin' is (yeah)
Baby, I care, baby, I swear
Only one real nigga here
Only two real niggas here (yeah)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Big shot (hol' up, wait) peanut butter insides (no)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot, big shot, (hol' on, hol' on), peanut butter insides (hol' on)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah

[Verse 2: AndreBlurz]
AndreBlurz mix up in the city
Don't know what to do no more
No rules, no hoes, no bullshit hanging on with me (like yeah)
Rapping like Kendrick, spitting like Kenny
Usufruct flow ain't hurt nobody
Lil' shawty, yo' what's good, are you lost without me? (out me)
I just need to know what's the move tonight? (tonight)
Ain't trynna' play, I just wanna live my life (trynna' live my life)
I don't wanna hang, too many fakes out, right? (fakes out, right)
Fugazi haze relates to clouds of spice
Andremix of Kendrick's 'Big Shot' hit
They don't expect it 'cos I'm still not famous and
Never heard of it til' now, so bow down to the lyricist
Creating shit and the hypocrites cite their sources
Without knowing it, showing it through stupidity, bitch
If I did it, I wrote it, I quote it now carefully, bitch, ya dig it?

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Big shot (hol' up, wait) peanut butter insides (no)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot, big shot, (hol' on), peanut butter insides (hol' on)
Outside, cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
