[Hook: Juicy J]
I want all the kush
I want all the bottles
I want all the cash
I want all the models
I want it all
I want it all

[Verse 1: B. Martin]
Ok, kush, bottles, shut up, swallow
Tonight I'm living life like there's no tomorrow
Got a couple girls in the Benz
And they all got friends, headed back to the condo
And I make all they asses clap, clap, clap, bravo
I want that lottery money
That “please don't say hi to me” money
That 'I could go back to my hometown
And get my city outta poverty' money
Don't lie to me honey, I know that thang fake
Put a candle on that ass, tell her “give me that cake”, wait
I rep NY, big boy in the big city
Shout out, 5 burroughs, the upper state, just ride with me
Now come drink on this bottle, and smoke out on this kush
Now let's fade away, and let Juicy go make it rain on that hook
Look

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Tell him I do Deniro, tell him you do Camaro
I do a fast car, something like a Nascar
Move like a sh-sh-sh-shooting star
And they know who we are, big pimping in the building
Got about a million, throw it at the ceiling
Layin smack dead in the face of civilians
Tell 'em I'm chilling with Patron on ice
And my home on ice, and my neck on ice
Lo-lo-lo-look at my ring, I'm a hustler string
You should learn me twice
I'mma grind till I die, that's no lie
Do with my middle finger held up high
Fuck the world, if it fry
I know one thing, I did my job
And that's get what? Move, tell a lie
Sippin on Henny, smokin on ly
Never let a penny pass me by
Move with the Benjis by my side
That's my sidekick, you better watch it
What I mean is, don't touch my pockets
Man big debts, cut them checks
Hundred mill plus, nothing less

[Hook]

[Verse 3: B. Martin]
Tell 'em I do [?], tell 'em they do kius
Tell 'em I got a couple girls in the Benz, and they extra sexy like ES
PN your boy got game, the magic wanna do the vein
Not ready but I'm way Kendick, so I say F it to all you lames
It's my time, it's my watch, homie
Y'all don't believe me just watch, only
Time will tell but I'll rhyme until I skip time, I'm Michael J. Fox
Got 86 on that dash, got 87 in cash, and I'm born in '88
Born and raised in New York, so you do the math
Pass that dutch, oh
I'mma get a little high now, get a little rush
So I take a little ride to the lower east side, hit the 169
Probably find one girl who was 6'9”
With another girl by the end of the night
I'm her suitor, I can tell the future
I'mma fuck them both at the same damn time
