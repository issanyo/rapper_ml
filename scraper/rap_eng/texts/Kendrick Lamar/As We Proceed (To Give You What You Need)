(Hook:A$AP Illz 4x)
As we proceed 2 give you what you need

(Verse 1:NJV)
Yo I got many chances
Monsters will never get fances
My beat was produced by me
I hold my head so you can see
As we proceed
To give you what you need
If they rule the street that's EA Sports BIG
NBA titles zipped up the trig

(Hook:A$AP Illz 4x)

(Bridge 4x)
No power
No monster
No money
No Love

(Verse 2:Kendrick Lamar)
Sorry that I'm not easily here
Have no fright have no fear
Ha Ha Have everything you ever ask
T T Take a little bus pass
Driving would not help you crash
Protect the world in the past
My Momma Never Let Me go
Compton,LA ready set go

(Hook:A$AP Illz 4x)

(Bridge 4x)

(Outro 16x)
When I hear woo woo woo
