[Verse 1: Eshon Burgundy]
When I first wanted to rap
I can't front man I fronted the facts
Fabricated every single statement that I ever made
At a young age said I'm running wit gats
No body shots man I'm coming for hats I'm at 'cha melon
Cool guy in real life but I'm a felon
On tracks
Then I set my pants on fire
Liar liar singing to the choir let me fall back
Then I fell on my knees and said oh Lord please a young fella need help
Told me He was all I need to love everybody else including myself

[Hook: Eshon Burgundy]
I love myself
And it's okay you feel a type of way
Ain't nothin' corny bout dat
I love myself
I'm a Christian rapper I ain't no actor man I'm really bout dat
My lifestyle realer than it's ever been
Even though you might be thinking it's irrelevant
It's realer
Fo' realer
On my mama I ain't never been a killa

[Verse 2: Eshon Burgundy]
In 06' I wanted them to trust us
So I said I was the hope pheind hustler
And then I dropped "A note for the hopeless"
That was 09' when I got focused
Just being honest if they looking they can find us 'cause we out here hiding in the open
Been grindin' but it ain't mere talent
It's an honor I could ever be a spokesman coaching
Players in the game of life
Might look like a dealer but we ain't alike
And I ain't better
I ain't said I was a angel at all
But I ain't finna stand here like
I don't love myself

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Eshon Burgundy]
I'm just trying to figure things out
Has there ever been anybody to ever take the same route
Qualified by the streets I was raised
8yrs young when I caught my first fade
5yrs young when I think I got saved
Got my testimony on the block in PA
Plenty things God used to bring about change
I could load 'em up and let 'em go like a gun range
I remember they was blowing kush in my face
Told me I was broke go ahead and smoke
Might as well wallow in ya sorrow
Unless you hit the lotto go and hit the bottle
Nope
Couldn't make me sell crack either
And I was trying to get chicken like the next man
Heard a false preacher say I need a bankroll so I was praying for the green like a jets fan
When I think back
Bout where where I ain't yet
I could've went and got it all like a blank check
Could be mad that I ain't got a hundred J's
All up on the stage wit a hundred chains
But I am a good father to my kids
Made a honest woman out of their mother
And I love her like cake on the plate of a fat kid
I'm real I ain't gone walk up on you like a undercover
Came as I was to the throne of Heaven and made a shameless plug
In the name of Christ Lord take my life
I know ya pain is love
Martin Luther King went to jail over 14 times and he ain't a thug
So where you think I'm going huh?where the prophecy going or to hang at the club

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
I've lost my head
I must misread what the good book said
It woes me be, it's a jungle inside
I give myself again until the well runs dry, I

[Outro: Eshon Burgundy]
I love myself (x6)
On my mama I ain't never been a killa
