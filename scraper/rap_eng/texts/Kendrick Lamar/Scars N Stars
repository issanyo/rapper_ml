[Colin Munroe]
Don't lie
I know what you dream about at night
With all your might
You carry them inside you all your life

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
Survival tactics, I practice
I got the scars of a lion walking through triumph

(Colin Munroe)
Oh...Oh...Woah...
Oh...Oh...Woah...
Take care
Not to get to much blood in your hair
I take my time
I get to carry these ones on my life

(Ab-Soul)
Uh, I got the scars of a lion walking through fire
To chase and face my desires I'm racing till' I expire
Aspire to be the great
The greatness is within me just pending until its escape
The feeling is splendid it's fibbing and beating the case
But wait there's a splinter in the splendor cause you just Can't
Please everybody and your adversaries want you to break
That's when you look at yourself in the mirror and then you say
It's me myself and I and I'mma try even if they hate
Try offending anything I confront and give my heart to the people
And turn my back on the government put my all in this music
Survival tactics I practice I keep my eye on the Judas
Counterattack with compassion
And Loriana is my angel, yeah Loriana is my angel
Wish I had heaven on earth to personally see your halo
Sick of feeling like God picking on me
Scarring all the stars in my galaxy
Soul!
