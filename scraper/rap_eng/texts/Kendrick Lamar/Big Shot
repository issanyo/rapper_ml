[Intro]
Wakanda, welcome

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Big shot (hol' up, wait)
Peanut butter insides (no)
Outside
Cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot (big shot) (hol' on, hol' on)
Peanut butter insides (hol' on)
Outside
Cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Sir Duckworth or Kung-Fu Kenny
Got juice, got work, got weight, got plenty
Got them, got her, got more, got Benji, yeah
Top off, gettin' topped-off in the city
Big Top Dawg and I dance on 'em like Diddy
Pop off and I pop back like Fiddy, yeah
I hit the ceilin' and forgot about the floor, yuh
Brand so big, got my haters on the ropes, yuh
This be the wave plus I live on the coast, yuh
When I touch a bag, young nigga do the most, yuh
Mm, woo, and I Wakanda flex (yuh)
And you know what time it is (yuh)
But don't know what grindin' is (yuh)
Baby, I care, baby, I swear
Only one real nigga here, only two real niggas here, yeah

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Big shot (hol' up, wait)
Peanut butter insides (no)
Outside
Cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot (big shot) (hol' on, hol' on)
Peanut butter insides (hol' on)
Outside
Cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Big shots (yuh)
Purped up, syrup'd up, nigga, like Pimp C
Flight suit, 'bouta slide down Space City
Top down, she down under like Iggy, yeah (it's lit!)
Lockjaw when the night-call too litty
Knockoff, get your rocks off, got plenty
Got rocks, got Jay's, got 'Ye, got Lenny, yeah
I need my engine, she need extensions (yah!)
Don't be the center-attention
Just play your position (straight up!)
Got my life on a yacht mission
'Cause they been a vision (yah, yah!)
Runnin' through these wave
Like I'm Moses out the booth
Hop out the trees (skrr, skrr)
Whippin' a frog and it leap
Foggy, can't breathe
Vacheron over Philippe (alright!)
Out in the street (yah!)
Chill with the gang, make it sweet
Big shots (yuh) (doo-doo-doo-doo!)
Forget your name like I'm Steve (yah!)

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar]
Big shot (hol' up, wait)
Peanut butter insides (no)
Outside
Cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
Big shot (big shot) (hol' on, hol' on)
Peanut butter insides (hol' on)
Outside
Cocaine white, body look like Gentiles (Gentiles)
Emotional, 'motional, 'motional, 'motional
Why you emotional? Why you emotional?
Ah, bitch, you emotional, yeah
