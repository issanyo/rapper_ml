[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm the coolest nigga you know
Migrated from the North Pole when I was fo'
Infatuated with cartoons and G.I. Joes
'Till something more greater took a toll: life
Not really, more like white Air Nikes
Evidently, I had a fondness for material things
Ten years old trynna get a 10-K ring
I forgot it was for me when the phone ringed
Elementary girls callin' the house
Desiree and Cheryl mama end hustled what we talkin' about
I'm talkin' about the good old days when we walked without knowing that could be our last time walking out
Now we can't walk witout protection
Bein' on the defensive, life ills
This life will put you in a crazy world
Just by knowing crime will never cure
So I'm strapped like Girbaud jeans
I'd rather see the pen like I was bowling
Rather than death, walkin' on heavy steps
It's a great place, but I ain't ready for Heaven yet
So I told God put me at the back of the line
Matter fact yesterday, swear to God I ain't lyin'
Movin' at a turtle pace, cause the fast lane got a day one uncle with one in the brain
Got one in the chamber
Sixteen in the clip, my eyes fluttered with anger
Hip-hop trynna save my life
Give credit whenever it's due, the money touchin' the roof
Breakin' the ceiling, with that being I'm breakin' the loot
With my loved ones, life way too short, son

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Shoul is, gotta wake up
Like a bakery, I'm trynna get the cake up
Never know when the day come, so we live carefree
Party like it's 1999, cherry cherry breath that I breath
Materialistic things, it won't mean shit when you leave
I ain't lyin', a nigga miss the good old days
Sippin Kool-Aid, Mama let the OJs play
Nowadays, it seems like the end is near
Cause babies killin' babies like Brenda did
Use ya head, mess around lose ya wig
Age fifteen, shit, a nigga witnessed it
Walking home from school, just me and my team
Shots fired, I guess it wasn't meant for me
So I thank the man in the skies above for his blessings until a nigga rise above
I'm fly as a dog, more dope than a drug
On the microphone, lemme kick the verse for y'all
Hip-hop'll never die as long as we alive
Top Dawg E-N-T, haters don't even try
You don't wanna pay the price of a lyrical ass-whoopin', we'll let it fly
Watch your career go up in flames, let it fry
Watch it die, no get back, just sit back, enjoy the ride
Live like it's no tomorrow, enjoy life

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
I'm still reflectin' on the death of
Mission of the better
Only one that's necessary for Sarah
See, ya'll can say whatever, but still it come together
I used to rip it down and let you sew it back together
Hip-hop forever, fuck 'em and whoever fed up
And I wish a hex on whoever met 'em
I'm obsessed with objection
And I'd probably blame Common for my resurrection
I used to love her too
So when I'm in the booth, we do what lovers do
But I ain't stingy, let my niggas get a piece of her too
Another piece and I'm through
Probably trynna peace up with you
Niggas got some believin' to do
It starts now
