I don't need no introduction
No ad lib on my name, 100 times for nothin'
You already know
It's K.Dot, city of Compton
Analogy is like Biggie [?]
Oakland and 2Pac, I'm more focused
I'm nothin' like these rap gods fumblin' over a few lines
Thinkin' they're high 'cuz their homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lyin' to you
You tellin' a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get their bars up
I bench press this rap stuff
Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my AC
