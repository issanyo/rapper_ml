[Intro]
Uh, I see everybody wanna play gansta now, huh
Well you know what niggas
I'mma just play Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Feel this
Uh, lemme shit on these niggas man

[Verse 1]
Look homie I'm not your crip or your blood
Homie I'm just Kendrick
See me other than him might plead the fifth amendment
Hard headed nigga shit all it take is an instant
Shocked to have scored just as soft as an infant
Say you bust your gun, but never totin' it
You say your man is dope I think he's smoking it homie
Why you provoking it don't mean to boast a bit
But you can call me a fly cause your boy be on some shit
Pussy fly so all the girlies think I'm the shit
I've got it to spend but still never buy them shit
You better guard your bitch
‘Cause all it takes is a finger to turn her on holmes
Something like a lightswitch
Hands down but still dark think I might switch the Jag for the Porsche
‘Cause it got a better steering grip
Young but been a man and you won't understand
Spree wheels looking like a bed room ceiling fan

[Hook]
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me

[Verse 2]
(Nigga) I'm from the land where fiends fly like Peter Pan
And the average man got a heat up in his dickie pants
I got some plans, to stack riches
Own 76′s like a Philadelphian
You don't know but now I'm focused like camera lens
And if I know your mans I might give a second chance
‘Cause I don't wanna hurt you
Have ‘em running in herzels
Shells stick to his back like a ninja turtle
Crack sells, drug sell all in the virtue
Been an artist since Prince played in Color Purple
Weed smoke hydro blow on that purple
2 straps on my side like suspenders on Urkel
I suspend they murk you, what you lying for?
You know you ain't eating like feed the children commercials
Man my children circle around your block
Let out shots and be home 30 minutes before they curfew

[Hook]
When the beef start cooking
And the shots start coming
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
People start looking
And people start running
Don't hesitate to pop that thing
Rolling down Rosecrans
I fear no man
I be God damned
If I live on my knees I rather die on my feet
That hub city threat shit is me

[Outro]
It's real
Kendrick
See me in the streets man
Come to me as a man, man
It's real nigga
Kendrick
You gotta respect it
Niggas respect me man (K. Dot)
Stop being some yank nigga
It's real
Lotta niggas tryna play gangsta, huh
It's 2004 man
You up in this shit quit it
Be yourself man
Still affiliated
Niggas respect me, bitch
