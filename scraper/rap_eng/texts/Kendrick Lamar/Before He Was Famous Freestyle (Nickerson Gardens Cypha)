I'm more focused, see I'm nothing like you new [?]
[???] the front lines
Thinking they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lying to you, they telling a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record 24 hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff, got it locked like handcuffs
I threw away the key, my cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all try robbing me
I shoot and have you laying between the sheets with the Isley's
We push the coupe like a high speed and the helicopters come and realize theres nothing behind us, it's behind me
Your honor, I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't really a rap, it's a porno, rewind it back
It's back to defining a loss, correct, they don't obey
Y'all ain't nice nigga, y'all just okay
Y'all  more than a Lil Jon phrase
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, a modern day Issac Hayes
Fingers on the shaft, new to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant?, I can do it without a pen and a pad
It's inspiration, something y'all have never had
If my pockets is something  you're trying to grab, see I pull out a rocket and peel you back like scab, you old news
Old dudes get out my way let the young boy come through, don't mention my age, SHIT
I'm on a mission for pay and you astronaut niggas just crowding my space
You not in my atmosphere, you can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fucking with this music biz
The industry like "Fuck it, let the music be his"
No theme park, I'm not trying to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here jump in the water
Do we really fuck with president Carter?
My reply is that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the bidding war popping like an auction
Five or ten labels like "What he hitting for"?, seven zeros or more
Remember having Aftermath sitting on my door
Money in front of me I couldn't open the door

I'm so far ahead of my time I got people 5 years from now pressing rewind
I'm hardly impressed with y'all, I hate rappers
Where the true artists at?, if it ain't a good picture you draw don't bring it to the architect
Often y'all arguing 'bout who got next
Claiming y'all running the game niggas is barely walking yet
Hopping all over beats without going through training camp
Try studying a few greats and then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Your songwriting ain't great, your mixtape is mediocre
You recycle the same quotes, you're not
Switching your flow, your flow in the same place
Don't just rap elaborate, expand, try to be more creative perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't saying that you whack, psych
Like an invoice I'm just stating the facts, right?
The metaphors I write
In fact you've been a factor you've feared your whole life, no TV show
Don't compare me with them, that's like Jaws vs. Nemo
A gorilla to a chimp, Jordan vs. Kukoc
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino
