[Verse: Harry Mack & Kendrick Lamar)
Uh, rest in peace, Prodigy
Harry Mack, visual raps, you gotta see
Uh, on New@2 and no one heard of me
Murder MCs, somebody throw a word at me (Hunnid dollas)
Yeah, I'm a lyrical scholar, every bar I spit I should get a hunnid dollars
Stack 'em up real quick, take it to the bank
Harry Mack, every lyric is dank, rappers get spanked (Water)
Yeah, one time, I'll bring 'em to the slaughter
Holler at the daughter, my flow is water
It's liquid, I'm sick, kid
I drink it out the ki-Crystal Geyser
You know that I spit flows wiser
H-Mack, I'm on it, you know I'm bout to hold it
High off off of Jade 'cause we rolled it, I told it
One time, Harry Mack, the mic I'm 'bout to slay it
He answered two out of three, so he ain't have to pay it (pen)
Ay, one time, Harry Mack, I'm in the state of Zen
Rip again and again
It's off top, I need no pen
Yo, I'm in, my zone when I'm on it
I hit 'em like a missile
I wish I had the bracelet with the crystals
But Mack ain't got money, right now I ain't paid
Every rapper gettin' slayed
I'ma make his frame decayed
One time, ayo, I cut him like surgery
Somebody throw another word at me
It's absurd how I free (Belt)
Ay, one time, my lyrics is felt
I'll make you rappers melt
'Bout to get the Cruz Show Belt
When I'm all up on it, Harry Mack, you know that I'm performing
Yeah, I'm a champion, Cruz Show every morning
Yeah, I'm 'bout to kill that
One time, I stay true
Hold it down with the best in the game and J Cruz
Yo, we out here right now
Never been down and out
Matter fact, I kick a freestyle and hit the Power House
Stage, it's Mack up in a rage
Makin' rappers disengage
We don't want no six, I'm up in the mix, with all of the tricks
Harry Mack, I holla get it done
And when I'm on the mic I just be shinin' like the sun
Hey, check it, I'm getting lifted off the marijuana
Hit the chronja and the ganja
Llama Llama Red Pajama
Yo, when I'm on it, I'ma hold it
It's Mack, yo, I'm gettin' it
Off'a the top, I'm cold flippin' it
Yeah, ay, one time, you know I get it done
I remember watchin' video for Heart Part I
My homie Brady B put me up on the game
When I watched the flow, I realized the shit was insane
After that, I saw Monster and I just knew
And before I really knew, then Kendrick had blew
Yo, 'good kid, m.A.A.d city' I was bumpin' the jam
Harry Mack, I can't believe I'm sittin' next to the man
Yeah, check it, when we do it, yo, the people have to give it up
Yo, we 'bout to take a couple shots up out the Dixie cup
Yeah, one time, I rest 'em with flames
I'm sayin' RIP Prodigy one of the best in the game
It's Harry Mack, yo
