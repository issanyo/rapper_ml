Visions of Gandhi Baldly Staring at me
They put his face on the money to show him smiling happy
Capitalism, I can't hold on for very long
So place your visions on paper i'm getting very shabby
Godly speaker, play messiah, Holy Swiggy, Pass a beaker, Place a order... Hallelujah to the very greedy
From the Back i Boo
They Say that i'm very wrong
My five senses of fuck you are going very strong
Touch my middle finger
Curse with my breath
The sight of a sinner, hear the footsteps of death
My heated arguments, make your book shelfs to melt
And in the pursuit of taste, serve yourself instead
You see i'm Brahmin, man i never heard a pistol
But my ancestors got the Pig Fat cartridges to bite into
Buddist Laws forbid you
You kinda miss the issue
The British came convinced you for the trade
They took your tissue
Like you
Slaves!!
Slaves to Hii Power
Slaves!!
Slaves to Hii Power
Slaves to your MRS
Food for though bitches
Everybody Slaves, we fall for those riches
