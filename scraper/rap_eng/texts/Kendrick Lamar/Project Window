[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall

[Verse 1: Punch]
Ayo, the sky scorchin’, acid rain fallin’ from the porches
These boys out here peddlin’ porcelain to the less fortunate
We knee deep in the bride of the four horsemen
Can’t tell the trees from where the forest is
More coffins filled with good lookin’ corpses
The Nickerson Gardens is like a graveyard, braveheart cemeteries
Seventh grade school picture on the cover of the obituary
I wrote it in my scrolls, literary student, a visionary nuisance
The voice of the movement, peep out the window, articulate confusion
The YG's raise the baby thugs like soldiers
Teach ‘em to run spots and throw ‘em from the shoulder
Shooters, gun toters, the older ones control them like MK ULTRA
Violence, the code of silence, baby girl wylin’, she got a thousand problems
She do hair and sell dope out of the same housing, she be too busy mouthing
In everybody business, the first one to start singing faced with a sentence
Section 8 tenants, the black and white buildings, parole violators, government assistance
GR recipients, collect checks and hit licks, [?] they sleeping with two bricks
Sold them wholesale to a snitch
They caught him on camera, promised him a sweet deal if he flipped
Plus they got him with the hammers, gun powder residue
That’s what I seen out my project window
Let it run, Q
(Smart ghetto ass)

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall

[Verse 2: Punch]
It’s only fair that I warn ya out in California
It ain’t safe to wear less than armor
But event the night fall when the day break is draped in smog
Shorty got longer arms than the law
Thinking he could box with God
You catch an onslaught even at breakfast, think is hard
Pause, yeah, they bake on bake meaning the couch
Young nigga shoot back and watch and hit everybody
Cause everybody ain’t affiliated
Whether you active or faking, it’s part of the demographic
That’s what’s fueling my hatred for the inner city
Blues, this music when them tools clatchin’
Kids get to answer questions in their middle school classes
Can’t recite a rap classic verbatim
Take 36 ounces, break ‘em down without weighing them
We can’t pay ‘em the attention crime paying ‘em
The ‘jects raise us to raise guns, the day ones
When them raids come, just play dumb, don’t say nothing
Do the bidding, spray and blend in, take the fade
Educate yourself, read up on the case
80% time served, 40k flipped the bird
Read the terms of your probation
He ain’t listen, he’d rather kick it with no henchmen
Gang conjunction, that’s violation, no more smiling faces
That’s the basis of what’s facing the younger generation
No more Reaganomics, just Obama’s promise
Got me sick to my stomach, make me want to vomit
A vicious cycle in rotation like the chronic
They light the chronic, sip the Henny, load the hollows in the semi
Pull it back until it’s empty on the enemy
That looks like them, self-hatred is a rare gem
Get out the water if you can’t swim

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
If I die tomorrow my city would come with me now
I swear the sky will fall
So you can tell ‘em come get me now
When are we getting old?
