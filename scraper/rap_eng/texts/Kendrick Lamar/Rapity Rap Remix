[Verse 1 - MeLo-X]
Was a good student, got all As
So the music that I'm producing is sort of like high grade
You can get so high that
You won't need a pilot
Everytime you listen you're gaining frequent flyer mileage
Politic on project knowledge with street scholars
In need of fatter wallets so they seek dollars
Holla, at the God, inhale, exhale
Then hail the king draped in Pharaoh's bling
Or something like it
Some will like it, others won't
But understand the flow is as smooth as a summer night is
Off the top when I write this
And the plan is to get a girl with the same eyes
As the goddess Isis
Looking for my Nefertiti in the city
Where we substituted hieroglyphics for graffiti
Don't get smacked silly, with ill battle raps
Under pressure niggas twist like sprite bottle caps
Tell Semtex to gather all his effects
Cause this here might get a few bombs from Flex
A few niggas vexed when we on the set
So a few niggas gotta get palms and necks
Cracked, snapple pop, pay attention ahk
Me and Mickey bout to make this Black apple pop
Like Snapple tops
From BK to the City of Angels
City where niggas throw up their hands in angles
To represent their tribes
And other colors, niggas love us
Kiss the mothers, raise the brothers I'll teach you something
You niggas got the game all wrong
You rapping for niggas in all y'all songs
I got songs like "Treat Her Right" unh
Ladies know when I perform, I be the right form
Any blog, website, Tumblr or forum
You're drug trafficking when you post up these poems
Love it or you don't
But yo my lyrics you will quote
You wanna see whats up, get a beat thats tough
I'll eat it up for sure
If you live than I'm liver, if you hot than I'm lava
Burning up, I'm the agua, shut you down when I rise up
Fucking ducking when I come in bucking with something rugged
Niggas can hate it, but as long as the ladies they love it
Check out the ratio at all our shows
I'm the God, I get all the...queens

[Verse 2 - Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick Lamar the modern day Malcolm
Humble and modest but these margins can move a mountain
I moshpit on the beat and leave the mark of a thousand ,Marksmen
Clearing the street and killing rappers with talent, preach
Yes I said talent, Kendrick ain't scared of y'all, can’t even spell competitor
Lord is my witness
I remember asking artists in streets how they did it
The only features I got is was this handsome face I was getting
How ironic, playing Sonic was the shit like a colonic
Now we vomit over these beats while critics pay homage
This is too street like my 23 summers in Compton
I go so deep, like my dick in your bitch hope the condom never do leak
2 seats, one car, all you hear yes daddy and snapped bras
High salary blow jobs, low calorie rap bars not me
My sweet 16 will probably need a school ID
And usually I be, the dominant victor
You know what time it is nigga
Affirmative Action, you fact or you fiction?
I’m a slain cracker from being insane
Pop a vein when I write this shit
I’m think on the shit, I'm vain and I think you’re a bitch
A female poodle under some homo's voodoo, sucking the industry's dick
We catching bodies, shooting dice in the hotel lobby, fuck your security
And that's at the Ritz-Carlton
My impurity's probably your best asset
I spit acid, hit your block and crumble your address
Leaving them stagnant
This is torture when I scorch you, or escort you
Out the building where ex-convicts with all sorts of
Portable handshanks, your man can’t stick to the script with handpaint
Popping your lip then popping the clip then popping your van, wait
We want the peace, but keep a piece
Said I was Malcolm to your belief whats up

[Verse 3 - Mickey Factz]

It's Mickey

From the depths of the seas
Back to the rap
Mick Factz motherfucker
From the, the, the Black Apple
Where the nightmares reign supreme
Stay ahead never beg cause I aim to please
Brain disease, sick spit flame degrees
That'll make Satan leave 'til his veins will freeze
Museum Mick, international women with high class
Will do E and look at you like I'm gassed
Oxymoron, big dog evict frauds
Slick boss that shop, tags get ripped off
I don't lie about what I cop like Rick Ross
Come to broads I dish off like Chris Paul
Quickdraw McGraw shoot and spit raw
I'm too hot cause I was born with a pitchfork
This kid hard, when I'm pissed off you lift off
These lip gloss ass rappers are so chick soft

Look lil mama, we ain't blood so Crip-walk
We ain't fam, you ain't my man so skip off
You get your Rafer on, I get my paper on
I'm sonning cats, I'm getting my Darth Vader on
Check the program
I'm killing rappers
Barbarian, I'm Conan
You hear the flow man

The best I know with my chest out bro
The Achievement is coming, thats not an Xbox goal
