[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Kkk Dot bitch
Damn I'm fly, ain't I bitch
Don't tell me, don't smell me
Since you say that I ain't shit
I be with those Benjamins
Like he was my sidekick
We Batman and Robin
Welcome to our private affair
Where, the narrow be right here
Where, the bitches be right here
22 here, you you
Won't you change your life boo
Together we can slide through
Midnight, Murcielago, loud pipes
Make sure that that head right, damn right
I be on that other shit make them want to curse my government
Dayum, hate the game, hate on me
And I'm loving it
I'm bouncing with a couple models sipping on that bubbly
I'm talking 'bout them yellow bottles with that bucket under it
Gone in my fast car
Circle round the block twice
So they know you [?]
God damn it I'm nice (I know)
And I see a lot of haters in this room
I just look them in they face, then I say what's up to 'em

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
I see some haters in this room
So we tell 'em I love you
Pull up in something brand new
Sipping on that goosey goose
We got some haters in this room
What we tell 'em? I love you
You, make, my life complete
I wonder where would I be
If it wasn't for you

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Ugh, check out the denim bitch
[?] jeans, that's some Japanese shit
That with the dictionary can't even pronounce it
Don't worry bout the name
Just know that they cost 3000
Compton, California
Home of them p-public houses
Where the beast live
And you can hear the city growlin'
Maserati prowlin'
Humping on your neighbourhood corner
Mother fucker I'm ballin'
No Motherfuck that I'm stallin' on them
Every time a nigga come through they be mad then a motherfucker
That's when I reached in my bag and I throw more cash like a motherfucker
[?] every time a nigga spending so I got it on splash like a motherfucker
3 words for them in the club every time I hear them come
Fuck them motherfuckers
Damn right, I could put that on my life
I use their negative energy for my appetite (hungry)
100 horsepower in my car
But I act a donkey
They see me when I see them then I say
What up homie?

[Hook]

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you see 'em what you tell 'em (Hi hater, hi hater)
When you leave 'em what you tell 'em (Bye hater, bye hater)
