[Verse 1: YG]
I woke up this morning, I had a boner
I went to sleep last night with no bitch, nigga, I was a loner
I be goin' through shit, losin' bitches and homies
If I don't make it with this rap shit, nigga, I might be homeless
My moms don't got a job, my pop's checks ain't enough
If ain't bringin' home that money, my whole family is fucked
That's why I move like the mob, I'm watchin' movies too much
If niggas wanted you dead, what would you suggest?
They wonder why I do drugs and hang with thugs
Since I made it, the city hated, wait, where is the love?
I ride around with my gun, this is not for fun
I stay protected 'cause my homie just took one to the lung
Had him on life support, with his family support
He knew who shot him but he ain't even show up in court
Yeah, that's a real G, nigga, he on a kill spree, nigga
The homie popped him so I hope he don't kill me, nigga

That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'

[Verse 2: YG]
Now I'm ridin' through traffic, with 2Pac blastin'
With a bitch that's irritatin' from all these questions she askin'
Like what bitches I fucked, when, how and where?
You ain't my main bitch so why the fuck do you care?
That's why bitches get fucked then turn around and get left
Somebody need to teach them "less talk, more sex"
I'm pressed when I'm stressed, my granny tell me I'm blessed
Well, why the fuck do Jesus Christ got me goin' through this shit?
Everybody need favors, what happen if I go broke?
Or say I ain't got it and buy my lolo some spokes
Right up in your face, said "I'll fuck you up like some mace"
So fuck your handout, give a young nigga some space
Give a nigga some Ace, give me a blunt that's laced
Sprinkle some molly in it, watch me take this shit to my face
The snitch is the shooter, they took time away from his case
Holy shit, oh, lord, where is the world today?!

[Hook: YG]
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I swear this industry shit, to me is one big-ass lick
I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R nigga "strip"
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been on Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile I'm grindin' cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo snow bunny equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up, I got a bad call
They killed Braze, they killed Chad, my big homie Pup
Puppy eyes on my face, bruh
And I really be drinkin', why the fuck I really been smokin'?
What the fuck? I'm the sober one
Man, I'm so stressed out, I can't focus
Hide out when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cutlass, me and little Ocho
Every young nigga hop out, 2 tears in a bucket
I feel like "fuck it"
The price of fame, recognize my pain, it's all I know
All out war but I'm out here though
Call my troops like "vamonos"
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, and it's all bad
Off OG with my OG and some OE by the tall glass

[Break]

That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'

That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'

[Outro]

Said nigga got this joint, nigga gon' get somethin' real, real nice, like
You gotta stop playin' me with that bullshit
Nah, I'm serious though, like, already checked it out, feel me?
Man, look, check this out, homie, I'm with the shits, man, you already know, what's happenin', what you tryna do?
