[Directed by SZA & APLUSFILMZ]

[Hook]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 1: SZA]
I can't recall the last time I took, advice from anyone
Shaped like a figure eight, who trusts pretty girls anyway?
And I can't recall the last time I took advice from anyone
I'm sure I'll be the death of me
And I can't recall the last time I took love from anyone
I called daddy, who's got one anyway? Not me
Are you hating yourself? Do you really hate me?
Are you hating yourself?

[Bridge]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Cross my heart then I hope to die with a peace of mind (a peace of mind)
Piece together my brain soon as this beat rewind (beat rewind)
Nitrogen and propane I spike your drink at times (turn up, turn up)
I make it hard to swallow this game, you throw up every line (every line)
I notice people got Napoleon complexes, that's my confession (yeah that)
You said that we're equal but I know you're beyond guessing that I'm beyond desperate (yeah that)
6AM on a Friday morning, my darkest hours
Them heartless hours
My apartment is lost in a coffin
I'm dead to the world like I popped me a couple downers
Down & Out on my luck
Salt water all on my tux and I call, she don't pick up
Then I fall when summer is ending
I mean there's no pretending I'm stuck in my ways and you're offended
That's life, that's you, this me, that vice
You're wrong, I'm right, that's right
I belong somewhere on ice
I'm cold, I'm a new blood type, even colder
Cold shoulder, Born Sinner, you know? Cole showed us!
I have nothing to lose, my dark side been well in-tuned
A Gemini gon' show them faces
And this here just one of my moods, Babylon

[Bridge]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me

[Hook]
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru
Crucify, cru-crucify me
Crucify, cru-cru

[Verse 3: SZA]
I'm really over the cryin' thing, wipin' my tears
Who cries anyway? Spread like disease all over me
We did ungodly ghastly things, last night I mean
Who's God anyway? You're mine any day
It's burning, take me
I wanna feel your power, this final hour, tell me
Are you losing yourself? Will you lose it for me?
Are you losing yourself?

[Bridge]
Was it worth it? Would you do it again?
Aren't you tired of always making amends?
I know you hate me now (here)
I bet you hate me now (here)
Bring on the thorny crown (here)
Crucify me
