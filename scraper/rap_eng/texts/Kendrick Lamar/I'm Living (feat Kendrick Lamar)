[Verse 1: VeEg]

Ya Veegy the realest
They hate on me coz i'm living
I'm talking JD all night
My homies know what the deal is
My brother's tying the knot
I told him cherish those moments
Every morning, you roll over
And you see what heaven brought you
My flow is so sick like Ne-Yo
So Heat like Chino
Banked up like Tito
I'm tryina hit these key notes
I find myself turning up
Now not only on weekend
I've got contacts on my phone
I really wonder who she is
Man I've got nothing to hide
I said on top of a hill
I met some skeletons on the way
Need that secrecy bill
Coz man the stakes are high
I got me a knife I'm  eating steak tonight
I'm living but i need a break tonight
Too much of life could be like Kryptonite

[Chorus: VeEg]
What's good?
I'm Living
How're you doing?
I'm Living
Are you okay?
I'm Living
You sure you're straight?
I'm Living
Now turn it up?
I'm Living
E C
I'm Living
P E
I'm Living
Where you at?        X2

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lemar]
My vision’s bothered by vigilantes that harbor on street corners
Try your hardest to harvest bundles of weed on ya
The starving’ll speed on ya, stampede on ya
Impede on your pockets then pee on ya
Dreams of us living lavish in fabrics of fine linens
Spending, established, with women dining and laughing
But this environment got us violent, ready to crash in
To society, take this driver seat, hope you fastened
Your seatbelts twice, when I rolled them dice, I crapped
So many times I can build casinos from scratch
Too many daps you might receive from the things you achieve, relax
That’s what my mental say, but my physical’s been detached, I’m on some other shit
Like fuck the government, I’m higher rankings, where’s the mothership?
I made a covenant that I was changing but my luck is bent
Quite disgusting when reality tainted, where the fuck you been?
Left him face down like he was planking
In a cold world where old girl and her homeboy got a motive
You can bench curl your tribulations, that sensation’s insulting
Got a wifey or a mistress, nigga which one you indulging?
Regardless of who you pick know life’s a bitch when you ain’t focused nigga

Chorus

[Bridge: VeEg]
Man I just came here to have a good time
I can't myself, myself
And if you've got a problem with that
Then you can move to the left, to the left      X2

[Outro: VeEg]
I don't know Yay, sometimes we can be so ignorant
