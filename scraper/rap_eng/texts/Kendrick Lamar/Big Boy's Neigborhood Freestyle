[Intro]
Classic, Young Gotti
Gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 1]
Look, swallow your pride and then eat a dick
Make the Ruler's apologize you ain't ruling the shit
I'm Rick Rubin in 85 with the beard thick
Dick bitch tight the movie and slanted eyes that squinch
I tell you that I'm one up, sun down then sun up
Son, I son niggas I probably fucked up your mama
No condom, it's good pussy
Pussy, tell it to your honor that this trauma is Jeffrey Dahmer
Took me too many moons set up this new platoon
Get ambushed or kicked, pushed with push broom
Man look, your man, look like sweet water
Corn bread to break under pressure if he's caught up
Big homie said I gotta crawl before I walk
And if I ran my mouth then my legs would get cut off
I'm just a  young boss with a bat cave
Back against the wall closer my back came back with them back pains, whoa
Tell em put my name on the blimp
Ball like I'm Derrick Rose you should know my gym
You playa's not allowed I'm sparking your game towels
And spikn' your Gatorade with gasoline I'm foul
I'm in the crowd like Artest and them
I move the crowd like Artest and them
Punchlines mean I really go punch civilians
Crunch time mean I take it to the hole
Not this basket but rather the good pussy that I'm in
I assassin you niggas I make you wait shake in
Blank tapes in your deck, niggas still break their neck
They hear it you need plans with the label just to spin
I need to clear it with the bank just to win
Club accounts go 15 racks when you wet like that shit
It's gotta be a sin. Hm. so Lord forgive me I'm a sinner
Hm. These hoes squeeze me cause I'm a winner
Back when we ate canned food for dinner, I coat food and the..tools make my agenda
I show fools I'm nasty like tofu I wish a
Motherfucker would get your whole career injured
This assault what a deadly weapon
Guilt your favourite rapper, favourite rapper last record
We fucked your baby actress on the map just what a blessing
Make that pussy ante up she call my dick anti-depressive
I'm really not depressed with, none of you niggas stressing
That's some of you niggas bless with the gift to carry the presence
A big in Pac and pop with..and with investments
15 minutes come up with 60 seconds
Last month I've been six hours inside of session
Came up with shit writers block niggas up in this stressing
Like who the fuck cares? who the fuck cares? Even if you get drunk up
Still be a millionaire
You could play a Santa Claus and make sure you're the whole dear
Every verse I put that bitch in the hearse, while boy stear
Uh Church to your pussy and push me get pack..
Verse that you cookie I read it my foot is here big boy

Alright
And you don't stop, and it don't stop
And you don't stop
And it don't stop
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
This be that shit that make real niggas grab they dick
And bitches rubbin' on they tits as if they think this monkeys rich
Monkey see what monkey do, you monkeys never make no tips
Climbup the tree shit on you
Paranoid the shit and bricks that can build the castle
Hastle and breaking your picket fence
I know pterodactyls that still exist
Clappin if you resist to cooperate, go home and see their daughters go..
You at risk if you wear bracelet, we want your wrist
We can taste it from planet pluto
Dog Gonnit you panic just like a poodle rip out your culo then kudos
Two door Regals, El Caminos, and two more
Sevilles with the whitewalls, wipe it off with my shoe ho
I feel you just menthol, meant to get smoked and sent off to your maker
Trace your..with no the ..coach
Mean ain't no hood high up in California and G watches snoops
Ladies press down I bet you dog watchin, west coast what's up?

Gangsta, gangsta you don't stop

And you don't, and you don't and you don't
And you don't, and you don't and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop
Yeah, ah
1 2, LA what's at it with it
Kendrick Lamar
You dig that, we out here

[Verse 3]
Me while I'm in Compon stomping through the swamp to swap meet
Going back to L.A. ya'll
Tryin to see what's poppin
You cannot stop me
Jay Rock, SchoolBoy, Top Dog Entertainment
We the best, with the west
Who can blame me
I've been put up on all the OG's
Dre Snoop, Quick Easy E
DJ Quick and now it's me
Then you see game, now we finna change
The whole fucking game smash it know you lames
Compton you should already know the name yeah we pop it
I shout out the whole westside because I got it like that
And if we had it once then we got it right back
And if you ever had it you won't have it no more
And if we see the back though we to the front door
Taking your bread, crucifying everybody off with their head
This is freestyle of the top of the dome
And you know Big Boi that's my home
What's up?

And you do stop, and you do stop, and you do stop
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do and you do
And you do, and you do, and you do stop
