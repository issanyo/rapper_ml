[Verse 1:]
I’m the only nigga doing it, you other niggas ruin it
I’m too legit go hammer with the foolishness
My nana said my grandma can maneuver this
Industry until I’m stupid rich
And now I’m stupid rich (so rich)
Even if she go away…. (wawoowoo) even if she go away
Assuming this is what they humorous
The pimp, the butterfly, my newest sh*t
In fact the rumor is way I’m proving it

[Chorus:]
I’m a Texas Man.. (Texas Man)
I’m a pimp C and your boy bundy
I’m Texas Man..Texas Man (hey girl)
Where they sip Conee and the purple codine
I’m a Texas Man, born and raised represent til the grave
I’m a Texas Man, whoa baby I’m a Texas Man

[Verse 2:]
Everybody in the scene show me love (what’s up)
From PA to H town got to know we blow it up
Got the whole damn city on my back (PA)
Tell em I’m gonna get the cash then bring you right back
I’ll be gone til November
Then I hop up on a plane gotta do a show in Spain
With some ladies and liquor (bring the wine)
Know we about to have a good time.. good time
And they don’t have all that.. no they don’t have to have all that [x2]

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I been that cold, but baby
Fine is all I know 50 carat
Watching all that for
Pay you know attention, what you doing all that for
Make your hoe a listen, I right a coalition
Pretty face, fat booty, cameltoe alition
When you were catching a buck
I was rhyming and busy
You went and got you a Chevy
Now me I bought me a Bentley
You finally found you applaud then I succeed on my pimpin
You been looking coat check to scope look like zero to pimp
I do this sh*t for the sport like it’s a hobby of sorts
I make that birdie spread eagle
And that’s your par for the course
And I’m a classic man made bask and dance
Soup black and tan with the racks in hand
So you got some bad b*tch, where they at though
I’m stuck on hating and know what they doing that for

[Chorus]
