HOOK

Yeah I didn't realize you kiddies wanted
Wanted to me to FAIL, when I'm flowing like REAL
Yeah I didn't realize you niggas wanted
Go back to JAIL, fuck paying for ya BAIL,  x2

SECOND HOOK

Cried so many times
About these lost Souls, walking around this TOWN
I pass the zoot to those who are DOWN, x2

VERSE 1

The rest of you FROWN, denial is CROWNED
Not being DEEP, but where is the LOVE
Closed minded PEEPS, don’t call me your BRUV
Come gimme a SHOVE, i’ll BOX in the face with no GLOVE
Turn up at NOX, to a babe
Cut in ya lip, like: 'show me some RUV'
I'm a changed man, nah playa in this GAME
Like Kloop did to OX, and I ain't looking for FAME
Man a look at tha CLOCK, and man a pull up my SOCKS
And man I'll be at the SPOT, five a side on the DOT
And man I’ll start the DROP, I say to my FLOCK
No lie I got you my GUYS, one vs FIVE, is my BLOCK
This FIRST prick I'll diss his CROCS and TELL em his MOTHERS a THOT
See I BURST my VILE dick she kissed, she SELL em to ya BROTHERS...
Soz I mean: 'MY LOT!'
Bruv I'm a PILOT: your RHYMING is crashing now you SOAKED
I TOKE VIOLET CLIMB and dashing as I
FLOAT and I CROAK, as I SMOKE while I'm BROKE
As I SNIFF COKE, and SIP coke, a SPLIFF of Weed, a LICK of SPEED
My head explodes without EASE
While my head explodes, on YA MOM'S KNEES
Oh THOT oh WHAT a TEASE
Same as you MA CHUM, so PLEASE, oh please
I'm mean, Don't LET me FIND her LOCK for my KEYS
I mean, don't SET my MIND for my COCK to PLEASE
I've BEEN, REHEARSING LINES, hundred TIMES NINE
My TEENS, were NURSING RHYMES
Never wondered MINE would SHINE like Nines
And I see you SHINING, that halo loop on ya HEAD
The TIMING of my jaw LINE, like COOPS SAID:
I keep RHYMING till ‘You're all MINE’
And I ain't lying I hear through grape VINES
You were getting through tough TIMES
And I've been away for bare time, pretending it's all FINE
But it eases the PAIN, it's too tough for my BRAIN
I feel we're one in the SAME,  just two different NAMES
Feel I'll be fishing in rain, one DAY
But could never KISS these misses
Cause they are not BAE, they are not ...
They are not YOU, wanna call you my BOO, but that can never be TRUE

HOOK
..
Yeah I didn't realise you Niggas wanted
Go back to jail, fuck paying for ya...

VERSE 2

Yo I'm paying for BALE, when I make I SALE
Smoke and drink ALE, 3 bars, just one shot, you get an L, (FIFA)
The BROTHER of KYLIAN,(Mbappe)you crabs cannae chase my TAIL
Nose SMOTHERED in RITALIN, but another time for that TALE
Nah fuck that's it's LIT, used to write for a TICK, from you waste PRICKS
SNIFF for a RIFF, back when I was a fake kid
'Oh your stuff sound aight, but you should produce your own SHIT'
What bitch?
You can't SPIT, how I TALK, like how CRIPS, used to WALK
So walk and STUMBLE spit out the GUMBALL
Cause like this dark DWARF, all I’m hearing is MUMBLES
Looking like WORF'S FACE, all ya words sound like BUMBLES
Wearing NORTHFACE, but your whole crew Mr TUMBLES, (Ransom FA/Crew)
Oh oh, yo
Yo fuck boi's, fill up the bowl, here comes the fucking RUMBLE
I'm PEAKING with POWER, you lot just CRUMBLE
Just SWEET and SOUR
Eating the BEAT, EATING it all, no more PETALS on ya FLOWERS
I'm HEATING like KETTLES, man’s UNSETTLED
Cause no one's made a bloody diss like
Yo Pick up your shit, pick up up your SHITE
Outta my SITE, picky when I WRITE
I press REPEAT on this BEAT
More times then chicks refreshing for Drake SEATS, 
Over 100, rather go UNDER
Find a pink haired CHICK, she know real magic WANDA
Then find me a SICK WHIP, like Timmy or WHEELZ
Could not care less if ya catching FEELS
These are not PARS, these are honesty BARS
The Kinda emotions you see on chocolate magic STARS
I'm not like these cunts that just chat bout just HONEY'S and CARS
I'm about fuzzing my, fuzzing those
FUNNY plus x3 BARS
