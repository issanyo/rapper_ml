[Intro]
Good morning america (ahh)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
The saga continues
Good morning america (ahh)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
(?)
(wake up, wake up, wake up)
A new revelation
Good morning america (ahh)

[Verse 1]
Good morning america
A new day, we gotta hit the schedule ahead of us
The letter K, D-O-T, add a space like a microsoft keypad
You can't see me, invisible ski mask
Poke the eye's out my beanie
Ghetto zorro on the headlines, i leave
Feces shit on niggas, nigga
My flow come in plural
Multiple of it, majority love it
I got the masses, meaning societies public
Low dickey shorts, LA fashion still holding grudges
Ain't forgot y'all killed Pac niggas
Ain't forgot y'all left the West Coast for dead
Tried to play it off like the paramedics was coming
Instead, we dusted off pulled the bullet out our heads
Left a permanent scar, for the whole world to recognize
California, economics, pay your taxes bitch

[Hook]
It's a new day
New chronic, new [?] spoke, new six tray
New Snoop, new 2Pac, New Doc Dre
A new West Coast to Wake up to, Nate

Good morning America
As a new Day Begins, the saga continues
A new breeze stepping in
I Hope that you're ready
Cause (?)
Brings for the new life
A new revelation
Show you right

[Verse 2]
Oho you done fucked up baby
Young kendrick the grown up baby
On enough to acknowledge your fuck ups maybe I spare your life maybe i won't
Maybe I give you the funk
Geroge clintion bring by the sentence like I got a english major in it
This is higher academis pay attention students
Niggas you is you foolin with a hand gun might as well have a harpoon then
I carry two or more with me like im car poolin
Ee miles deep when its beef I dont say get em I say move in
S.W.A.T team so aggressive turn a mind up problem ????? extreme coolaid red beam on top of my weapon
Notice my proffesionalism im perfecting my craft you niggas is half doin your job
Insubbordination ima have the boss get you fired oh I am the boss get terminated bitch

[Hook]
It’s a new day
New cronic
New hundred spoke
New six tray
New snoop
New 2pac
New doc dre
A new west coast
Don’t wake up too late

[Chorus]
Good morning america (aah)
As a new day begins the saga continues
A new breeze debonair I hope that your’re ready
Because as the gold daytons spin
Brings forth the new life
A new revelation (the second coming is here)
Show you right

[Verse 3]
The moral is try your best to not collide with the best of him
I ain't talkin bout you i talk about jay, Nas and him
Creme de la creme homie
Pockets fat hand boney
How is that
Kinda ironic the west coast i undelrine it
Make him my prioirity in orderly fashion i ain't livin' in
Nobody lasted in time nobody closing your blinds the sun is shining bitch

[Hook]
It’s a new day
New cronic
New hundred spoke
New six tray
New snoop
New 2pac
New doc dre
A new west coast
Don’t wake up too late

[Chorus]
Good morning america (aah)
As a new day begins the saga continues
A new breeze debonair I hope that your’re ready
Because as the gold daytons spin
Brings forth the new life
A new revelation (the second coming is here)
Show you right

[Outro]
