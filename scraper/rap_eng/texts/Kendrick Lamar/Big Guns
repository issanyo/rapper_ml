Aw shit rock stepped in the place
You know he got somn’ on his waist
Two niggas beside him yeah they got something on their waist and they’ll let it spray if he say
And Fade away like a J multiple shots for your face
Left the Proof for the highlight tape for the FOX 11 ? Coverage
Hot ass bullets leave that ass suffering
Nigga better have my money
He act silly, smack his ass with the semi
Then smoke his ass like a philly watch his departure
Then hop in the charger skrt off in the hemi
Stay with them burners the shit that’ll burn ya
Send a hot one through your sternum you earned em for talking that shit bitch

Ready for whatever, whatever you gone bring
R&B gats on my hip they gone sing
Send shots through your coat damage your whole spleen
Need a barrel smoking like a pipe from a dope fiend
Move with the metal or plastic
Shooting shit up like heroin addicts
My goons won’t hesitate to body a bastard, have him looking right in front the pastor
Got something for those that open their gums
Put the barrel in your mouth have death at the tip of your tongue
Shhh shut your mouth or my gat do it for ya, permanent nap in the dirt for ya
If you want it you can get it in a LA minute
Put the frame to your brain leave you there laying there finished
Have you stuck in the streets leaking like a broke down engine with your body parts missing

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I’m a solider from Watts California, a place where them niggas run up on ya
Don’t be hanging out on them corners, when them van doors slide open nigga you a goner
What Do you prefer getting hit with a pistol or a llama
Better hope your chest got armor
Slugs rip through your flesh, leave you laying in a mess
Send you to the grave with the rest
I don’t lift weights I bench press the .38
Throw a stray have you waiting by them pearly gates
Man the streets ain’t safe better stay in the house
The grim reaper in the streets and he taking em out
The block filled with syringes and sirens
Shots letting off bullets spread like a virus
Nigga you a fool you put your gat in retirement
Thats how niggas out here expiring
You gotta stay strapped

[Kendrick]
Down central
Eyes in my rearview cause you never know who’s out to kill you
Lookout, lookout, lookout, lookout, lookout yeah
