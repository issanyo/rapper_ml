[Verse 1]
I feel like friends overrated
I feel like I've been baited
I feel like going missin'
I feel like I've been trippin'
I feel like there's no winnin'
I feel like I've been sittin'
I feel like I been sinnin'
I feel like I've been hittin'
Even though there’s no listens
And my Early Beginning
It was never left finished
I feel like I can't breath look
I feel like I can't sing look
I've been hard at fighting look
I feel like I can't breath look
I feel like I can't dream look
I feel like Simplisity
Is turning to stupidity look
I feel like I can't breath (Strong Inhale)
I feel like I can't sing look
I've been hard at fighting look
I've been hard at my dream look
I've been hard when she sing look
I just made her my queen but
I feel like I ain't king look
I feel like I ain't me
When I talk to her I'm pussy look
They think I want pussy look
I know that just ain't me
But that's how they make me out to be
They're the enemy, you are the remedy
Don't listen to jealousy

[Verse 2]
I feel like my family hates me
I feel like removin' the safety
I feel like a motherless child
I feel like a deadly facade
And screw the world it got me feelin' odd
I feel like, I don't even know what I feel like
To be honest I don't even feel life
Pettiness runnin' deep in the veins
Feel like everybody busy playin' games
Realize they don't really wanna feel the pain
So they pop, smoke and drink every little thing away
I feel like I can't rap slow, deep, all of the above
They don't like my songs, only turn up
I'm so much closer to givin' up
I can't do shows ain't nobody showin' up
I feel worthless, church-less, broken
I feel work-less, wordless, hopin'
They still breathless, jealous, knowin'
I’m here, rapping talent growin'
To be straight up I'm depressed
My family don't know it, I'm a mess
Work hard everyday I strive to be great
I strive to be the best, I put myself to the test
