She couldn't understand it, her last man was perfect
Didn't think she'll find another man
Little did she know his mistakes gave me the upper hand
Yeah, she feeling down, had the swish of dro break it down
No peer pressure for her first time, she decided to make it now

My little bonita mamita hop in the Lecross and roll the window up
Inhale a smoke, recline the seat back
Had ... tool booth intervention, well I got a job for you
Just put your head down, pull that zipper down and pull that d out
Paranoid I'll quickly be out after words, we can finish after words
Well, let me break it down, we bout to do this that and the third
High in the clouds, with the birds you shy but baby you pretty don't worry

I used to love you like cereal on the weekend
Probably cause you knew what I want whenever I need it
We had a first acquaintance, I knew I had to repeat it
Your reputation was famous, your number never deleted
The type of girl that live in the dark and have you in awe
I remember when you said 69 was an art
My fault you said it was your major, to me that's major
And then you had did me that favor
Whats on the playlist for tonight
I know you like to be down for whatever
Whenever, the light is not too bright
Come again and I'll bet you
We'll have a baby under the moon, in late June
A jump off that never thought would jump at the broom, boom

July flew by and then it hit late August
Semester started in the fall, and now we slowly falling
Your body profanity has stop provoking me often
Youre curves is the curse ...
Ash your doubt in the tray before you pass it
I know that your passion was smoking hash out astro
I didn't ask you, personal questions
... to your past love, lay you down on my campus
And ... baby girl I loose my air, ... to show you that I'll stay right here
Yeah, beauty in the moon light glare, ... your best time to loose right here
Set the mood right with this...right here
You're too high... why do I care
