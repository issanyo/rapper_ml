[Hook]
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do

[Verse 1: Melo KAN]
Look, this isn't entertainment (no), I ain't no entertainer (nope)
This is your education, learn not to be a hater
Moving up like elevators getting close to my destination
Hand this vest and I'll detonate em
Blow up something, that's stress relieving
I'm in a world where the money makers get the pleasures
So all the pretty girls will fuck you if you're spinning cheddar
I mean the pussy good, but I feel success is better
The best defense are friends who love you when they felt the pressure
Pressing up and they go compressed and now I'm part of their conversations
See my life as less complicated, they're contemplating my conversation
(?) my place don't waste my time cause I ain't done celebrating
I never thought it'd feel this good to say we finally made it

[Hook]
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
And I swear this shit feel like my birthday
Hub City my birthplace uh
You'd rather roll over than live in a blizzard, or die in an earthquake
This could be a catastrophe, no one got the audacity
To show blasphemy, to the god of rap, nigga I go back like an artifact
And I got my weight up, all is fat is brought to you by
Kendrick and the all-mighty eye, HiiiPower
And I tower, over y'all like I'm 12 feet tall, every hour
I'm real fast, supersonic
Brace yourself, orthodontics
Orthopedics, I collect, your bones, if I need it
Mars Venus, that's the planets, I go to when I wanna be organic
Earth place too fake ha touche
Unguarded every time you pump fake uh
Pump brakes uh, nah, never that can't (?) wait nah
I'm living by the G-code nah mean, killin' rappers 'til they break uh
None, of, y'all, ball, like, I, do, every time I slide through
My pimpin' just remind you that

[Hook]
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, ohhh

[Verse 3: Melo KAN]
See I'm, staring at the world in my rear view trying to get a clear view heaven only knows what I've been through
Barely on my toes are a tissue, trying to get a hold of my world is an issue
Show my potential, know that I'm here to beat (?)
If you orderin' b, I'm comin' with speed to crush every dream and your (?) is true
They only really start to hatin' when they go against you
I'm easy to get at (twitter), I'm hard to get to
Life said "pick a number, any number to describe the feeling"
I'm selling four down, bout 15 hundred yeah

[Hook]
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
They see me going big, I'm making it
I'm getting money now but people think I'm changing
Now I'm just celebrating that we finally made it
You don't like, you don't like what I do
