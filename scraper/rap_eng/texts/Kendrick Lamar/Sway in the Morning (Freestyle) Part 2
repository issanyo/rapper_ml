[Verse: 1]
As my mind drift
Then split, like the middle of a spliff
I began to catapult off the cliff
Of the unknown, I got a feeling in my funny bone
That we're not the same, just antonyms of a different age
My soul flock, with the carefree
Words of the wise, I spoke a hundred times like a Goldie
(Haha) L-M-F-A-O. I hate yall, but I spread love like mayo
Then spread slugs
My brain matter
Is a brain fatter
See my vision
Or my vision'll stare at ya
This is the future if I say so
Yall copping fitted caps
I'm about to go and cop a halo
The God of rap and I mean it
I play kickball with Mars
And marbles with Pluto and Venus
Witness the genius
I interact with the inner city villains
That are into your circle
Like a computer hack
Then give you that (Haha)
