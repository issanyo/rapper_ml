[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I got, I got, I got, I got— Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA I got hustle though, ambition flow inside my DNA I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon I don't contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head This that put-the-kids-to-bed This that I got, I got, I got, I got— Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it's in my DNA I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard I know how you work, I know just who you are

[Verse 2: Tots-Kray]
See, I was, I was, I was—
Cruising down the street when you were high on table tops
Dressing up like a damn idiot and fucking all those mops
Switching flows just like my hoes and no one ever told me stop
No one ever told me “Stop this shit, before I call the cops”
I just win again, and win again
There ain’t no misconception
All them other hoes who wanted dick was fucking, no exceptions
She destroying shit and killing shit with her only damn weapon
This shit is so crazy, I might give you a damn lesson

[Interlude: Tots-Kray]
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
5,4,3,2
I wasn't tryna get
That girl, already met
All of this elegant
Ellen DeGeneres

[Verse 3: Tots-Kray]
You are irrelevant
You can not handle it
Tristan been shaking, ever since he handed it
I been so souping, no really, I felt like it
I’ve been saucing, looking at the damn tournament
Woo!
Fuck your family
Fuck your man
Fuck your peace
Fuck your girl
Fuck your friends
Fuck your ends
Fuck it man
Fuck anything you ever fucking liked fam
Cause I been living in a world of my own
No shit, in my zone
Just sitting in my home
Doing work, killing bones
You talking shit on your phone
I’ll beat you to death with a damn cone
Pass all this bullshit
My life wasn't build up like a tool kit
Fuck all the writers who used shit
Ima let it slide, better pass one
Go to the past one
Drizzy get the loot, he a fast one
Make one, take one
Boy you better snake one
Deciding on all the people, you a fake one
I might trace one
If a damn nigga got A1
Yes, I might as well take some
Preach! Get all of the fuckers you tryna reach
Walking up and down the motherfucking streets
They be biting like a damn motherfucking leech
All them damn bitches be something you wanna keep

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I ain’t gotta get still
I ain’t gotta get still
Just live your life
Get outta mine
Why is this so bad
Fucking with your dad
Just live your-
