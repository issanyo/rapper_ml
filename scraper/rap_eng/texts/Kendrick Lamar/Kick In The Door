[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Watch how I kill 'em with the funky rhythm
Rappers I babysit 'em like soap operas they are my children
You dealing with the most phenomenon
My style raw like Madonna on, PCP
B-I-G, Frank White used to rock hand me down air nikes
Now I style proper, i gotta
Be laced in linen that's Versace
Polo fleeces, my bitches in Vicky secrets
Dom Perignon to carry on the festivities
Cristal when the sun go down
Anybody wanna touch me, the gun go "blaow"
It gets ugly, like New York momma, who want drama?
Biggie drop bombs like Osama, my bank account
What can i say? comma comma, comma
Kami-kaze, snap shots at you like papparazzi
Definition, Junior Mafia, ?

[Hook x2: Jay Rock]
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
All you heard was "Dot, don't hit me no more"
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
All you heard was "Punch, don't hit me no more"

[Verse 2: Punch]
It's Punch people, on a quest for the root of evil
Tread softly, death row is where the Ruger leave you
I'm no shooter, but you know my people
Blood pressure get to boilin', you know black people
They got them 44's, Macs, them Eagles
Pack them in the back of a Reagle, and come clap your people
Ride the track like a Mack truck on diesel, mattafact
I don't rap, i just do it for my people
It's so easy, treat the flow like a freethrow
Tryna' take me out my zone, watch me let three go
I'm 36, old, speak with eses, kilos
Icicle flow, yeah, I'm so below zero
Kick in the door if you try and play the hero
20 like the heat, you ? casino

[Hook x2: Jay Rock]
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
All you heard was "Dot, don't hit me no more"
Kick in the door, wavin' the four-four
All you heard was "Punch, don't hit me no more"

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't worry bout' none of you rappers
Most of y'all talking practice, actors like Denzel
Until you trapped in a lion den with stake
Under your chin, oh well, shouldn't play with Big Poppa
357 over my boxers
Magnum, tell the doctor I shot ya, ugh
Toe tag 'em, crack with purple tops, we bag 'em
House licks, we ski mask 'em, baby baby

[Verse 4: Punch]
Let me get it, let me sink my teeth in it
Put you niggas in a cobra clutch,with no submission
It's to the death, to the endin'
Push you to your final destination, hurry up, your casket waiting, who told you put a thought together ?
You brainstormin',  I control the weather, i'm thinking sunshine
