Murder wack rappers peacefully,listen breathe easily/
Seems to me you hate seeing me spit but bitch leave me be/
These sick ass bars make you nauseous watch your back keep cautious/
I'm the little engine that could i know i can't stop this/
I'm the fucking feces i tear mc's into pieces/
I eat all you dumb asses for breakfast like wheaties/
Some days i don't have enough middle fingers to go round/
Fuck the doubt the time is now to make all my haters proud/
Wanna hook i'll give you a hook going straight through your jaws/
Strictly lyrical something spiritual nothing but bars/
Fuck opponents look at music components their composing/
You know wits owning, everyone else fake they just posing/
I'm one earth to enlighten to spark the brain like lightning/
To brighten up your world so much to leave haters sightless/
They put you down like yey low down on the ground like jay lo/
But you gotta rise up from all the hate and say hell no/
Sometimes your exhausted don't have inspiration lost it/
Haters mouths keep running like faucets blabbering nonsense/
We've all been fucking suppressed oppressed too stressed to get rest/
Thats exactly why their obsessed to get you upset/
Our main goal as humans is be shaded by money trees/
Money heats money feeds,let me tell you what money means/
Of course we need it but most of us spend for wrong reasons/
Not feeding needy who be pleading the streets weakly/
Instead we buy the ps3's psp's 360's while people out their struggling to eat/
Yo, in order to change the world we need to change ourselves/
Have you seen the news lately fucking world going to hell/
Let us come together fuck dividing stop the lying/
Were going straight to extinction the future is coming start the thinking/
Plan ahead before we're all dead/
