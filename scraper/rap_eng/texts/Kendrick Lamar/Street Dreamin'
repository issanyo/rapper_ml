[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Take a trip with the narcoleptic
Suffered insomnia, but this time it was only seconds
I see thermometers boil as you lay in the desert
Of eternal fire hate ya then deny yourself of a blessin'
Meanwhile I'm on a new cloud chunking the deuce
Renewed vows with sinners, homies, enemies too
Gold towel under my feet clicking the fluke
With a thousand troops, Crip and Piru, nigga, woop, woop
Love I depend on, white dubs I depend on
They flying through this endzone that meant on to vent on
So listen, homie, you miss me with that bullshit
I keep my distance, homie, I am on a higher pulprit
You cannot visit, homie
I mean the beauty of heaven is far for me not to exit
It's ike an anti-depressant, you see the vision, homie?
I mean this godly advice, fucking right
Even if you pinch me twice, yes I, keep dreaming

[Bridget Kelly]
Lovely lullabies
I don't see another thing but starry skies
And louds of clouds beneath my wings and in the skies
As far as hazy as can see the sun will rise
And illuminate this life, this life
Oh why do I have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time I'll try
I'll try not to wake up from this dream

I’ll try not to wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I won’t wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I can’t wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I won’t wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
(Dream, dream)

I will not forget
Fixating the part of faith I've never met
And explaining away the reasons as I slept
So beautiful here I wish I never left
I never know which one's a lie, this life
Oh why do I have to return to reality?
Oh why, this time I'll try
I'll try not to wake up from this dream

I won't wake up from this dream
I can't wake up from this dream
I won't wake up from this dream

I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut
I won't open my eyes again, I'll keep them shut

(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
To wake up from this dream
(Dream, dream and if I keep on believing)
I won’t wake up from this dream
