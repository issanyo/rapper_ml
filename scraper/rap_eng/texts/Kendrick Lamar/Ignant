[Verse 1: Ammo, Tha Warchild]
They knew he was West Coast when he walked thru the door
In all gangbang attire bodies parked on the floor
Rag in his back pocket, nigga, dare him to trip
Faded and associated with the Bloods and Crips
Ask questions if you want to, two to ya dome
I stay making donations to the funeral home
I gotta aim like a marksman, bet he leave crawlin'
Afghanistan spitters on anything walkin'
Nigga known to keep the burner with some extra shots
I let my mothafuckin' tech play connect the dots
Same whores and gang wars, time to settle the score
Hit 'em all with the black talons, leave 'em dead on the floor
You fucking with psycho, like no other
With a nine in my pocket and the mind of a hustler
Certified riders, Comp-town's finest
You should rewind this, warhoggz behind this

[Hook: Ammo, Tha Warchild]
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)
They say we ignant (What it do!?)
They say we ignant (What it is!?)
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)
They say we ignant (What it do!?)
They say we ignant (What it is!?)
They say we ignant (Nigga, what!?)

[Verse 2: Vincent Maggiano]
I don't wanna pop pistols, have something hot hit you
Plus I'm running from the feds, got kids in block issues
What you gon' do when yo' homies is not with you?
Cut out yo' eyes, mail 'em to yo' mom's in box tissue
You are not official, I don't do it 'less it's beneficial
Vinnie gonna have to let the semi whistle
Have that ass on the ten o'clock news
Don't get killed for tryna pay dues
Stay sinning, always be winning while they lose
Roll Benzs, fucking these women off Grey Goose
Close your curtains, disconnect your mind
You're soul searching, you talk shit but you won't hurt him
Let the fo' burn him, so the next time you speak up on me
You gon' feel it up in your sternum
I will never leave, that's just how it is so let it be
Before I have to hit you with the Desert Eag'
I rip the melody, and flip a set of keys
I guess it's meant to be to have me sailing on the seven seas

[Hook: Ammo, Tha Warchild]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Ride like it's four wheel drive (Ride)
Ride till we forklift the tires (Ride)
Ride and we never get tired, ride on our enemies
Crime chemistry got me hemorrhaging blood out my memory
I'm Ted Bundy if the money exist (Ah, nah)
Al Bundy 'cause my other hand is gripping my dick, ain't nothing funny, bitch
Monopolize my prophecy, they watching me thru binoculars
Obviously, bitch, I'm Pac in these Wallabees
Wanna-be's wanna be me, take one of these then take it easy
The Lord wants you and Forbes list need me
Lord forgive me for my ways, I blame it on how I was raised
Inside of a cage, praying with slaves
Compton, California, the coroner work for seven days
Throughout the week, you might as well leap yourself to a grave
Lunges out a bottomless pit, bottles of Hennessy
Guzzle another fifth, pop a pill then pop in the clip
Pop a shot then circle the block, then you just repeat it again
Ammo, reincarnated, Rambo, now tell a friend, motherfucker
