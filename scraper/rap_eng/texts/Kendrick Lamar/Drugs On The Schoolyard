[Produced By Blue, The Misfit]

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm whatever the streets made, the saint
The renegade the chain on the timid slaves
The dead on the corner, the van of the coroner
The ambulance first-aid, the criminals crime wave
The dominate at point guard, the drugs on the schoolyard
The kid on the go-cart, the bucket that won't start
The ruckus that won't stop, the city that hate cops
The niggas that's fed up, shoot and shake cops
The obstacle war block, the feeling of victory
The friend, the enemy, the positive energy
The negative force that forces you to sip Hennessy
And sin like a sinner that exempts all sympathy
The churches that God built, the verses that I killed
The curse that the devil gave, the start of the end of days
The happy and afraid, they dap me and give me praise
But we're nothing alike, see I am life, motherfucker

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
And everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
It's a few things you won't understand
And so I say comprehend the best you can
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am

[Verse 2: Blue, The Misfit]
I'm the seven-headed monster brought on by revelations
The evil conscience temptation that makes you wanna start hatin'
The fallen angel mistaken, now you think that he Satan
The reservation I'm dating, the devil infatuating
I am the groupie that knew she liked to go fight with her parents
Now it's loosely apparent that she gets loose, now a parent
I am that child support that says nah, nigga, you stuck
You should've never have fucked, lost money over a nut
Her pussy came in the clutch, that VC wasn't enough
Her plan A was a A+, a plan B, never had one
I am the robber of the gun, I am mistakes, I am strife
Of course not, we're not alike, see, homie, I am life, motherfucker

[Hook: Blue, The Misfit]
And everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
It's a few things you won't understand
And so I say comprehend the best you can
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
Got damn, everyday I am, got damn, everyday I am
