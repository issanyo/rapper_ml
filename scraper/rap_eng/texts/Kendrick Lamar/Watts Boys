[Verse 1: Emjae]

Two in their ass and one in their head
And bitch I ain't stopping 'till I get this bread
I know that you heard me but do as I said
I'd rather be [?] than [?] with the feds
I'm back at the bridge
You niggas is sipping on 40's, I'm topping the keg
You know how we play
Like G's coming up off the [?]
Two in their ass and one in their head
And bitch I ain't stopping 'till I get this bread
I know that you heard me but do as I said
I'd rather be [?] than [?] with the feds
I'm back at the bridge
You niggas is sipping on 40's, I'm topping the keg
You know how we play
Like G's coming up off [?]

[Hook: Emjae and (Jay Rock)]

Watts boys in the hood spit nothing but that hot shit
Doing what we gotta do to make a profit
Keep that thing on your waist cause niggas poppin'
Hesitate cuz, they'll let you feel them shots boy
(Watts boys don't play
Watts boys stay struttin'
Watts boys survey
Watts boys bust gats
Watts boys pushing weight
Watts boys got cake
Watts boys throw K's
Watts boys throw [?])

[Verse 2: Emjae]

They hate your boy cause he ripping up your track
I was gone for a minute but now I'm back
I never fall victim to the struggle
Keep your eyes on that nigga cause you know I'm 'bout to rumble
They call me Emjae
Got a cerebral for the stingers
Competition gets the finger
When I'm switchin' my demeanour
I'm hotter than that 745 series Beemer
I blaze so many trees, when I leave smoke lingers
I been addicted spittin'
Niggas freestylin', they grittin'
Get to forgettin', then it's on they album when it drop
My verses steady, be hittin'
I do this here for a livin'
Flow with precision, yeah you know my style is too hot
You know I'm lava
Instinctive just like MacGyver
Pop haters, like they surprised
Don't fuck with those night riders
I treat my rap book like a whole Ki
Keep it on the low then get if off like a OG

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]

K.Dot get dough
K.Dot get paid
K.Dot get hoes
K.Dot is not afraid
Whenever them vultures, start flocking 'round my way
Got my back against the wall, uh, I'm ready to spray
Standing by the lightpost, breakfast
Got my hand on my hand on my right toes
Cause shit gets, hotter than Hell's Kitchen
When fingers itching, it's more scratching
The DJs practice mixing
It's not baseball, but we stay pitching
No waist like [?], I'm trying to tell who you are
Somebody come up missing, I swear it never fail y'all
Bullets is like shadows, the way that shit [?] y'all
Them feds got the line tapped, so we make collect calls
Local payphone, Superman, no cape on
Monkey on my shoulders, I got the [?] apes on
We love blowing up shit, my style is like napalm
What nigga?, who nigga?, begin to fuck with the kid
And we'll shoot, at you niggas, what type of shit you got in?
Yeah, it's just a simple assignment
To make to make you niggas lose conscience

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]

I roll deep like the president
Nigga Watts is my resident
On the block I hustle hard for them presidents
Raised in a dangerous environment
In the projects where you gotta stay close to [?]
He like a fireman
Refrigerator filled with no food, only a lot of gin
So much weed smoke in the place, can't breathe in oxygen
Job didn't work, back in the hood selling rocks again
I'm starving, real [?] so I gotta feed my poppas then
It's gutta, I'll rob a nigga for birds
Leave his coupe on fire
Leave his brains on the side of the curb
In the hood, yeah I'm blowing that herb
My phones tapped, Rock making business over the chirp
Yeah the block stay hot, like a furnace
[?] the corner with a burner
Put a shell to their back, like a hermit
This is just a warning dog
You made us [?]
They don't want it with them boys from Watts, California

[Hook]
