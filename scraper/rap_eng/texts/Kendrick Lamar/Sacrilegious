[Verse 1]
Gloomy on sunny days, shadows no house or trees
Prayers not close to me as I bow down and take a knee
Hell goes far as the eye can see, hoodies and weaponry
Naive to being free, locked up, we chasing keys
How your eyes investigate us, while we look up to entertainers
Ball players, pistol bangers, big brothers, uncles, uncles
Betrayed by a lot of homies, all my friendships stay on shuffle
Huddles, steady find a plan, spread evil beyond the land
As I clench down upon this trigger, the burn fucking burn
Every step to getting deeper, survival my main concern
Marinating in Satan's sweat, take a sip of this holy water
Hoping God still keep me blessed, with a dark shield for my armor

Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life

[Verse 2]
Promises, man, I promised, none of them goals accomplished
Promises, man, I promised to be loyal and honest
Promises, man, I promised, lied on separate occasions
Promises, man, I promised, my promises is aging
Hennessy what my system like, feeling like Superman
I might crip tonight, I bring loss to life
A gruesome site, look who don' got involved
It's no different from wars, it's kill or be called upon
Feeling teary eyed, thinking I've gone too far
Ask God for forgiveness, shit I doubt he heard me at all
They say clean your hands before you eat, rinse your sins with prayer
But I've done did some things I don't think I could ever wash away

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q]
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Need him in my life, put him in my life, bring him in my life
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
Woo, woah
