Classic Timeless rules forever

[Talking]
By the time I start writing when I was thirteen I knew from the jump I wanted something that was original that was classic

[Freestyling]
I freestyle over anything give me a instrumental
I bet I make bells ring
I bet I make birds sing
It sounds that good
I'm so street and I'm so hood
And I'm intelligent and I'm special and I'm heaven sent
Haha

When you think about rhymes and style you always want a classic feel so my first introduction to a classic shoe was the moment I stepped in school and said, I want to put something down on paper. I started writing. Everyone in the classroom was wearing Reebok classics

Hip-hop was more than just the music. It was part of culture. It was part of havin' style it was part of a whole graffiti and arts

Hot off the press
Hot off success
Look how I dress free, me
Reebok complete
