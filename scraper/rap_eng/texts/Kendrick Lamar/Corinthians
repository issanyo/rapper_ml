[Verse 1]
Absent body, present spirit the flesh
Upon my body only fears the feeling caress
Born without the craving of aliment I was blessed
Premature but be mature before those fed from the chest
Can't say I ain't been eating as of late I ain't been sleeping no rest
While y'all are speaking of waste I'm taking defense. digress
From all the hatred I've spoken existent in recent
The mind of a mid 90 kid breaking out of the sequence
I've planted Apollos watered but guess who has increased it
Flip your pages to 1 Corinthians and find 3 6
That means my greatness is given if  taken steps to reach it
God given if I give in to giving up all my peaches
A thrasher georgia born kid a mind of vaster
Atmosphere of casper and castro fueling disaster
A master carrying the planet inside of a satchel
Better than the more stressful carrying upon the back though
Laughter and smiles something I was never kin to
Distance from my utmost different from my friends, who
Lived up in cut so I lived around a venue
Rice and beans of Sinsu feeding we pretend to
Eat another meal cause we never liked the menu
Knowing I'm more hungry made me timid to befriend you
Observant of higher echelons, living as just an Estaban
Searching for a sweet life, then dying after my Epilogue
Chaos born as a marvel and royal, Eric Crosby-ing the artlover loyal
Combined creates the fine line of art and insanity
And on the march of dime I walk the line just to better me
Elderly telling me I need to live beyond the regular
Go big the white men telling me I can never level up
In first grade my classmates asking me if I'm crip or blood
The life I've lived I can almost say I was never young
But I had a room full of hot wheels, toys in a sterlite
Boom when the Glock yielded by fools, on the curb like
Move when the cops here, weed let it burn right
Add to the toll not talking bout a turnpike
Typical, typical, with a kid who was living through
The roaming criminals pitiful get it in never difficult
When we sin never miniscule, I remember when in the school
I was friendly till middle school started feeling invincible
Had my hand on my genitals, as my feelings negate
Living long enough body will begin filling with hate
I wasn't minding my mindset was in its visceral state
But then again. .
