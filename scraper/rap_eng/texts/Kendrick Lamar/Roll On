[Hook: Major James]
I ain't worried about these niggas trynna hate on me
To me it's all just jealousy
Don't wanna see another brother get his money
So I roll on, roll on, roll on ,roll on
Everyday stay fresh and stiffy
And oh boy your girl is out to get me
Man the streets is filled with envy
So I roll on
Roll on
Roll on

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Rolling up the cronic, isn't it ironic
My money rolling like Sonic
Divas in my lap up and down like hydraulics
Got a pimp player degree but never did college
Niggas steady hating when you steady getting dollars
Got 99 issues your bitch ain't part of my problem
Used to be broke now I'm getting cabbage
Got marble on the floors in my project palace
No more crack money getting paid off my ballads
Went from dirty money to visas you see my balance
Welcome to my habitat East side gutter
I could whip you a cookie, best believe it's gonna be butter
Then I hit the club pissy drunk of that bubba
Gotta stay high 'til I die motherfucker
I'mma get this money while you niggas envy
Haters want me to schh
Then come and get me
Please

[Hook: Major James]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Kendrick Lamar, young nigga
Before I ever wear a chain, I make sure you know my name
I'm the same good kid from the block where you was raised
Didn't have a pot to piss in peeing in your pj's
You see my story is a story untold by the kid from Compton making straight a's for new clothes
Surrounded by bullets from one of my relatives foes
Because he been a killer since he was 12 years old
The price of being guilty by association got me places I ain't ever been
Like in back of the swap meet niggas trynna test my chin
Squaring up like a nerd before summer school begin
Then break when bullets breaks wind
All I wanna do is rap
But it's a wrap
When you living inside of Iraq and
George Bush in the culdesac
You get pushed and you righteous act
It's a murder charge on your back
Can I captivate this captive before you try peel my cap
Can I live
Huh
Kendrick Lamar
