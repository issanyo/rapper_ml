[Intro: Zahi]
Yeah
Delinquent Mindz
Ayo, no eye has ever seen
No ear has ever heard
No mind has ever conceived
What God has prepared for those who love him
1 Corinthians 2:7-9

[Ab-Soul]
My nigga, what it look like?

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Niggas hating, bitches hating, babies dying
Bullets flying, helicopters, police sirens, preachers lying
Genocism, criticism, unemployment, racism
Burning buildings, AIDS victims, cancer killing no cure
Oil spilling, turmoil, poverty stricken, police brutality
Kicking ass of us Africans, hostages in Afghanistan
Not to mention another prison, child molesting
Cow intestines, botox injections, earthquakes that's government tested
Secret society weapon, opium plant manifested
Then turn to crack then invested amongst us Blacks just a message
To hold us back, great depression amongst Iraq, no direction no Google map
Just a Tec for the soo-woop swerving, izuzu then blap blap blap
Adolescents go coocoo, mothers are boohoo crying
The governor keeps us starving, these commercials keep us buying
These cigarettes supermarkets fill up our liver with triumph
Distincted livin' with science, no place to live in, no Zion
See that's forbidden, we fryin'

[Ab-Soul]
My nigga, what it look like?
(That's exactly what Hell look like)

[Hook: Alori Joh]
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is homeboy
Tell it like it is nigga, tell it like it is, tell them what's up!

[Ab-Soul]
My nigga, what it look like?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Malcolm laughing, Martin laughing, Biggie spittin'
Pac is rapping, Gregory tappin, people singing, bells is ringing
Children playing, angels praying, 14 karat golden streets, collard greens
Red wine, potato yams, turkey legs...

[Verse 2: Zahi]
...Culinary breakin' bread
Children that were born dead
Bob Marley smoking while
Bernie Mac joking
Beautiful sculptures of Jesus, Mary and Joseph
Everybody floating, celebrating in thug's mansion
Michael Jackson dancing while J Dilla scratching
No taxes, no coke, no drugs, no pain
No hoes, no lust, no hate, no rapes
No guns, no fame, no stress, no lies
No bills, no deaths, no crimes, no kills
No debt, no cries foreal
No time in jail
No sick, no cash, no poor
No sins, no crack, no porn
Won't send your ass to war
Will you make it through the narrow door and see the good life?
Well if you do let me know what it looks like

[Ab-Soul]
My nigga, what it look like?
(I wonder what Heaven looks like)

[Hook]
