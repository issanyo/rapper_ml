[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I love money, I love bitches for the lack of better words
Ain't got no time, ain't got no feelings for the lack of better words
I miss your call four time this evening for the lack of better words
The music loud, can't hear it ringing for the lack of better words

[Verse 2: SZA]
You got nothing left to offer but a lack of better words
Get nothing else from me but a lack of better words
Had a nickel every time you get a lack of better words
Feeling cheap to be your woman for the lack of better words

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
But I say my ego gotta yeet for the lack of better words
I can't love you, I love these streets for the lack of better words
But if it's true, you would trust me for better or for worse
I'm selfish, I can't help it, for the lack of better words

[Verse 4: SZA]
You gon' be like this forever for the lack of better words
You gon' get your shit together, no, no you never learn
You cannot do better for the lack of better words
Never can let you forget it any time you on my nerves

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Na, na, na, all you do, make excuse
Na, na, na, all you do, is make excuse

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
(Pussy, pussy, pussy, pussy)
I wish a nigga would (ah!)
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga would
I wish this nigga (yeah!)
I wish your mhm-mhm-mhh
I wish this nigga (uh!)
I wish a nigga would
I wish a nigga (yeah!)
Stuck in a rock and a hard place [inaudible]
God damn, bitch, hoe, huh
Yeah, woah
