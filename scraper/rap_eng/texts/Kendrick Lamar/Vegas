[Emily Main]
You're the one who gets my heart to race and my arms to sweat
You're the one I'd risk my life and waste it on a bet

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Temptation sweet, I taste it
That casino waitress, drinks sedated
You the one I want, you the one I want, face it
You the one I want on a one-on-one basis
You can see my weakness, a week is not long enough
I need every season and this the only reason
You the one I want, you the one I want
Leave it all on the table even if they catch me cheatin'
Doin' blackjack, twenty-one, twenty thousand in it
Probably twenty more before I'm done
If gambling's a sin, then I'm rollin' dice with Lucifer
To make sure I ain't losin' you
That's what a crab shooter does, I'm bankin' on the win
Bankin' on the last, vacant from the job that I had
Life savings in my pocket
If I never make it back, then I had the option of takin' a risk
So before I slit my wrist, I'm a cash in on this last poker chip
You can bet

[Hook: Emily Main]
Ooh, Vegas, baby, ooh, Vegas, baby
Ooh, Vegas, baby, I was scared of you
Ooh, Vegas, baby, you're Vegas, baby
You're Vegas baby, I was scared of you

[Outro: Emily Main]
You're the one who's got me drinkin' wine until I'm fallin' down
You're the one who keeps the slot machines spinnin' around
