[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I fall in with an attitude, Billy badass with a back pack full of bad swag
That I picked out I'm a hand it out to, anyone that ever did wrong to me anything that
Did wrong to me I'm a take it back like a vac, you pay tax tonight. Bully!

[Verse 1: Mark Foster]
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette, hanging out his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
Yeah, he found a six shooter gun
In his dad's closet hidden with a box of fun things, and I don't even know what
But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

[Hook: Mark Foster] (x2)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Run boy
Are you ready
(Kendrick)
Do I look like danger? Do I look like a criminal's anger? Do I look like problem when I tell 'em
That I got 'em? I can even make the famous famous. Pull up, pull up bring it back up rewind
Then I pull out the cups then we pull out the wine
I'm a rebel you a rebel then I'm bout to rock
Climb, I'm a ticking time bomb in California, land mine!
Explode everytime you run, your ligaments stay ahead of me
Everybody say they killing the game, I shoot! and you dead Meat

[Hook: Mark Foster] (x2)
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks you better run, better run, faster than my bullet

[Hook] (x4)
