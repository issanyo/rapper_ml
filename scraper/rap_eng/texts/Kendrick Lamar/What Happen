[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Yo the boss is back
Off the strip with 10 horses
Town on his back, flawless rap
But check my motives its big checks in the check I wrote it
Hardcore kills raps, spin it back
One flick off the wrist and wahla it is Ab
So if you see the kid napping that don’t mean I took em
That mean the cemetery got to find a place to put em
I think you might have put your hands in the wrong pudding
Or your man ? fucking with the wrong hoodlum
I’m not Bum J but all it takes is one day
Or one hour of recess to lets the guns play
(what happen?) I had to let the gun spray in his direction
In his direction like raid to an insect I infect and
I’m straight letting em go like its 8 seconds to go

[Hook: Kendrick]
If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)
Oh nothing that boy was being himself
Like, sike, nah I’m bluffin’ that boy was somebody else
So we hurt that boy, hurt that boy

[Verse 2: Kendrick]
They say a closed mouth don’t get fed
But a loud mouth get a tre of bullets right to the head
Bon appetite, I climb out my window I shoot ya block up then I’m back in the bed, sleep
Back to the business, backpack with blocks all in it
When it comes to beef I’m doing the dishes shit
More beef then I’m stuck in the kitchen
To stop my trigger finger from itchin’ I’ll probably need a prescription
Plus, I told you niggas too many times your not in my division divide mathematician
Counting money like it grow on trees
Matter of fact it do, I got a lawn full of hundred dollar bills, no leaves
My bitch got a blade inner weave just incase mine break she hand one to me
Cataracts I know y’all can’t see I intact I apologize about that

[Hook: Kendrick]
If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
Cause we don’t give a fuck about who you running’ with
We will flame yo shit and all you gonna hear is (what happen) yeah (what happen)
Oh nothing that boy was being himself
Sike, sike, nah I’m bluffin’ that boy was somebody else
So we hurt that boy, hurt that boy

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I walk it how I live it
Call it how I see it
I don’t live by a script you wanna be whats on the TV
Yeah I’m Jay rock  I’m the one haters love to envy
So I keep burners, busting clips until they empty
Straight to his head til his skullcap is empty
And if I’m ? I’ll be back up in a jiffy with a semi
Smoke his ass fast like a Philly watch the automatic lean his ass back like a willy
I’m silly with the 9 millimeter shot to his bathing ape outfit
Put his flame out quick I’m bout G shit you you, ain’t bout spit
Sniper his ass watch his ass drop unexpected like bird shit
A general so you gotta salute the Colonel
Give you a warning Disobey you gone by the morning
The bullets come free with a casket see
But you broke so you can’t funeral with fear

[Hook: Kendrick]
If you talk that better have enough balls to walk that shit
