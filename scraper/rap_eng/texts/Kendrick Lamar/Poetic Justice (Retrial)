(Verse)
In the thunder and rain
You stare into my eyes
I can feel your hand
Moving up my thigh
Skirt around my waist
Wall against my face
I can feel your lips
I recognize your fragrance, hold up
You ain't never gotta say shit
And I know your taste is
A little bit, mmm high maintenance
Everybody else basic
You live life on an everyday basis
With poetic justice, poetic justice
If I told you the flower bloomed in a dark room
Would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems and this song’s dedicated to you

(Chorus x2)
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

(Verse)
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty option plain
Cold nights when you curse this thang
You called up your girl when caught up in the ity bity rain
Heard that she wanna go and party, she wanna go and party
Don’t approach her with that atari
That a good game always sorry
They say conversation ruination
I can tell
But I can’t right my wrongs
Unless I write em down for real, alright

(Chorus x2)
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song

(Verse)
I really know you play this
‘Cus oh boy you test my patience
With all these subjective photographs
And all these one life vacations
Love is not a verb, you should look it in a mirror
Love is not a verb, if you’re lookin for a maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
Fatal attraction is called, what we have in common is pain

(Chorus x2)
Anytime, you can get it, you can get it
Any place
And I know just, know just, know just
Know just, know just what you want
Poetic justice, put it in a song
