[Hook: Kobe]
Bumpin' N.W.A., smokin' chronic, sippin' on gin and juice
Back in 2001, I was smoking on the chronic, too
Now I need a Detox, yeah, yeah, yeah
We can't do the same things that we used to
Nah, nah, oh nah

[Verse 1: Scoe]
I remember growin' up, lil' Dogg Pound pup
Bumpin' "G Thang", mixin' gin and juice in my cup
And all I knew was N.W.A
Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre
Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and Rage
Kurupt and Daz, RBX, the original gang
Tray Deee, D.O.C., I can go on for days
D.P.G.C., this the way I was raised, ayy
When mothafuckin' 2Pac was the shit
Specially when he was rockin' on the Doc's shit
Killa Cali where it all started
A legacy, me, I'm just happy to be a part of it
This West shit is history in the makin'
This here is the next step, California's best kept
Scoe the mac, I'm a Y.A gangsta rider
I remember South Central L.A, we wanna

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I remember when it all started
On Alondra, in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Poppa flickin' blunt ashes all on his garments
Momma off a wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four but it's like I heard it before
House party crackin' off of the music Doctor record
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mockin' that shit like a parrot
My cousins kickin' up dust, Crippin', their flag, wear it
'Round their hand like a mitten, aim and use it for leverage
Shittin' on Compton sheriffs like "Fuck the Police"
Woofers and gold Rollies, every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped, dropped a dub
Just to hear Doc drop a jewel for the sake of hip-hop
Whoever thought the moment I seen you on bullets for "Cali Love"
15 years later you'd be savin' my life, what?
