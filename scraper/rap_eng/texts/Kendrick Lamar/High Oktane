[Verse 1]

[Showkase]

I said L.A on my back arms
Plus I'm strapped in the booth with the fo fifth

Yeah i keep them black arms

I keep the AK on Like Akon
Constantly Blowing shit up

Just like Napalm

You inhale it in ya chest baby
Puttin holes in ya lung till you exhaling out death baby

Until theres really nothing left baby

Put holes in ya tef dissenter grating your chest baby

Death to infidel feed them niggas infamil

In the icu i fed them niggas sickleshells

From fucking with the top dawn money gang

Not from long beach but ill show you whose insane

Psychotic loco mentally deranged in the brain

Y'all niggas don't know what I'm saying

My shit complex y'all shit just plain

Like a brown bag of m&ms y'all niggas is lame


(Hook x2)

Lames stay in ya lane

Cause the shit i spit is high oktane

Y'all can't obtain what i bring to the table

Nigga I'm the kane and y'all ain't able


[Verse 2]

[Kendrick Lamar]


Showkase High Oktane i got it

If money be the topic  / strong arm robbery
Im randall cunningham once i make you get outta pocket

Mhmmm...

Every line is a narcotic
Id be lying if i said i never distributed crack product

Color blind if it ain't about dough/ then i don't holla
I got cataracts if a dolla ain't where I'm at

Say hello to your honors

Prince hakeem in them latest paper denim jeans/ chains and pinky rings

Get custom made top dawg logo

Versace shades more bounce than pogo sticks

When i dip in the low low

People like he gotta be rich no

I made a fortune off your employment

Making that whack shit

Raise rap bar competition

With no dollar need help no problem

Not even a chain nail salons can help you to be more polished

Than i better yet get a nose job smell me



Hook [x2]

Lames stay in ya lane

Cause the shit i spit is high oktane

Y'all can't obtain what i bring to the table

Nigga I'm the kane and y'all ain't able



Verse 3

[Showkase]

Nigga I'm the kane and y'all ain't able

Constantly telling lies y'all niggas be telling fables

Call me the x-men ill hit you with that cable

You can take the exit route and leave with no doubt

I'm on the block with a couple blocks and a couple knots

Looks like a nigga is really building blocks

Dawg on top of that bitch

You can see the sick side of this red nose pit

Yo inactual shit dont even exist

Like a backwards sentence you ain't making no sense

Evil knievel constantly stuntin on niggas

Like a toilet seat constantly shittin on niggas

Psychotic loco mentally deranged in the brain

Y'all niggas don't know what I'm saying

My shit complex y'all shit just plain

Like a brown bag of m&ms y'all niggas is lame



Hook [x3]

Lames stay in ya lane
