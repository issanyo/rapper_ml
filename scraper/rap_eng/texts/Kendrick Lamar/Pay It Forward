As a kid, having a mentor was vital to me. Always being there when it counted allowed me to make some of the most important decisions while growing up. So it's only right that I mentor a younger person with the same wisdom that was given to me. If it helps the next kid become a better person in life, I will forever be aware of my influence and pay it forward. I look where I'm at today and realize that most of my success is owed to the mentors that was in my life.

I sat down with President Barack Obama and shared the same views. Topics concerning the inner cities, the problem, the solutions and furthermore embracing the youth, both being aware that mentoring saves lives. Sometimes I reflect and think back, "Where would I be if I didn't had the presence of an older acquaintance telling me what's right and whatâ€™s wrong?" Telling me the pros and cons of every move I was about to make. Telling me the best way to plan success for my future. Join me in paying it forward. Support My Brother's Keeper by being a mentor in real life.
