[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26s on deck
And the bitches they be on it

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26's on deck
Stock 'lac gotta fresh paint pussy juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
I pull up on them hoes, roll my windows down
Let my music out, four 15s shake the ground
Smoking on that medical, sipping on some medicine
Top Dawg letterman, she wanna ride, I let her in
She sexy than a motherfucker, plus, she brought her best friend
I guess that's a two for one, party at the Weston
Five star suites, bottles everywhere
Wanna fuck a star on the moon? I could take you there, biatch
I got a swagger of Mick Jagger
If you want her, you can have her, I done had her, we done had her
They be shooting at my ladder 'cause I’m standing on a pedestal
She gon' give me good head just cause I’m ahead of you
Jay Rock, flyer than Hancock, no shit
I’m a king, fuck a prince, I don’t know no Will Smith
I don’t owe you niggas shit, I’m a self-made nigga
Ain’t that’s why your bitch let me fuck on her for days nigga?

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26’s on deck
Stock 'lac gotta fresh paint pussy juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Catch me in that fast lane, burners like I’m Max Payne
Married to that money, bitch, women want my last name
They be on my bumper, mayne, screaming out "OMG!"
Oh, I be P-I-M-P, 2-P-A-C, that's M.O.B
Him or me? You choose, I ain’t gotta do too much
I just lay back, smoke my weed, and turn my bottle up
Candy paint, leather guts, slide through like an avalanche
We don’t ride no Avalanche, so high I might never land
Trips to Never-Neverland, smoking on Afghanistan
A.K.A. that kush, nigga, I’m on Heaven’s roof, nigga
Big dawg, I go WOOF, nigga, don’t make me let my goons loose
Choppers make you shit your pants, thought you drunk some prune juice
Swear that I’m immune to, stuntin hard, gettin paper
Owning land, buyin acres, that's the reason why they hate us
I don’t give a fuck, middle finger out the window
Beamer, Benz or Bentley, Ferrari, sorry, we Enzo

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26’s on deck
Stock 'lac, gotta fresh paint pussy-juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
187, I’m killin em' when I’m whipping it
Touch a corner, it's a murder, wipe my fingerprints
I thought I told y'all, used to have them packs
In a black Toyota, Macs by my scrotum
Now it's matchbox Hot Wheels when I roll up
Always online, stay connected like a modem
He tryna snap a picture, she 'bout to snap her neck
A real Blood pull up in a cherry cherry X
400 horses, Hollywood park it
Chevy kinda awkward, interior green and coffee
I shake them haters off me, as if I had fleas
I'm a Top Dawg, rare breed
Shoutout to Rare Breed, they keep them hogs running
And my garage is like the show, I keep them cars comin'
You hear my name hummin' in the streets, buzz big
Got ya bitch eyes rolling like my rims is

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I keep them big ol' 26’s on deck
Stock 'lac gotta fresh paint pussy-juice wet
And the bitches they be on it
Oh, man they be so on it, oh, whoa
I got a fast car, Nascar, yes
Two seater, stick shift like some turbo jets
And the bitches they be on it
Oh man, they be so on it, oh
