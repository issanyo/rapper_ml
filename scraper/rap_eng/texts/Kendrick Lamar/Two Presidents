[Hook: YG Hootie]
Two presidents and we blowing presidential
Two presidents and we blowing presidential
See my hood shine, pray I live to see the day
Rest in peace to my homie, he got hit up with that ('K...'K...'K...)

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar] (2x)
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
I'm screaming out peace
But his chopper piece a bad outcome

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm vicious, and my house is a red light district
And my couch is a porno star, out of town from Houston and Memphis
And I never gave a fuck and I never did fuck with y'all so I kept my distance
Just me and my day-ones, and a thousand ones for these strippers
Ho I been on my own, get on the song then pee on the song
My bladder is gone, I shatter your dreams
I'm Freddie it seems
My shadow is wearing expensive cologne
Pigtails and dookie braids, cabinet full of Kool-Aid
I'm ghetto as fuck and my pedal is up
But I'm gassing on all of you niggas man
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
I'm screaming out peace, but his chopper piece a bad outcome
Stale face, how come?
Is it cause I do me? Or your main bitch wanna do me?
Face shots - we call it Call of Duty
K-Dot now bitch give me two feet
Made my bitch come give me two G's
Raised by wolves and we do eat
Play by rules and you might live
And I try to do this shit for the kids
But y'all got different prerogatives
And y'all rot in hell
And I dwell where the fortune live
And that's vicious

[Hook + Bridge]

[Verse 2: YG Hootie]
Big mouth, settle me down
Tell YG this how you hold a choppa
I ain't gonna lie I be feeling like Obama
Shootin shit wit Dave, mama knock [comin]
This is illusion by the Patron
Chopper cocked and I'mma clap mine
Homies in the pen ain't never coming home
Creamed out car from the Chevron
Me and my mama in the county line
It was food stamps, now it's passport stamps
Bout to come back to the deuce line
Told you we'll blow like deuce nines
BSM - we cannibals
Eat your flesh, no antidote
Kendrick - that's family though
We on Rosecrans, it's a party ho
This right here's that Martin-Malcolm
Only difference we still alive
By any means necessary, squad life we down to ride
Interstate, rival Pi's
Seen them tears on my mama's eyes
Do whatever it takes to keep my daughter fly
I'll do whatever it takes to be immortalized

[Hook + Bridge]
