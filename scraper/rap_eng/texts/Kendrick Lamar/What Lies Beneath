[Verse]
Livin' in my own world, I could never die
Ambition of a hundred kings livin' in the sky
Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me
My destiny tellin' me that God got me
Grace in my own greatness and I made this
Pandemonium and victory, I can taste it
Set me free, I wanna be set free
I wanna be remembered in my own legacy

[Hook]
We fight, we cry, we live, we die as kings
We multiply with gold, our hearts will bleed
You recognize this more than just my dream
Once you realize, you'll know what lies beneath
Know what lies beneath, know what lies beneath
Close your eyes and you'll realize you know what lies beneath

[Verse]
Nothin' can stop me, no nothin' can stop me
My destiny tellin' me that God got me
Came from darkness, I made it with sharpness
Back when I said that I tried my hardest
I will not lose, I paid my dues
I failed several times, I tied my shoes
