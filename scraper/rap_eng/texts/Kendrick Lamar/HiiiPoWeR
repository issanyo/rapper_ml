INTRO:
Everybody put your W's in the air
The sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
Now & Forever HiiiPower

VERSE 01:
Visions of death staring at me
Martin tried to change this world, someone dream with me
I'm falling victim to this powerful song, it's Pac's clone
Back to put you wack rappers to a place they call unknown
People hear my lisp whenever I rap on this disc
You want to spit but jumped on my dick
Rap music never should have to be censored down
Unless the music is fuckin dumb, just wipe it with your bum
I got a thought that'll blow like a missile
Aiming it at a pig, these people ain't gonna miss you
My issue has been televised, I'mma tryin educate you guys
How these people mistreat, because race exists only in the mental
This is visible and simple, I won't make you know it
You'd forget your birthday if this damn media wrote it
And everything on TV is just a figment of human creation
I don't need this racist nation, read that I ain't the damnation
While you mothafuckas fading, I'll be off to MGM Grand
Staying spirited, making my own hieroglyphs

[HOOK: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPower
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPower
Five-star dishes, food for thoughts bitches
I mean the shit is, Huey Newton going stupid
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

VERSE 02:
Visions of death staring at me
If I see him clearly, I might be able to beat his darkness gladly
Sorry mama, I can't sit and stay quiet
They've already knocked over half of us off the edge cause we defiant, uhh
And now I always pray for the weak, uhh
These demons got me, damn I ain't pray in some weeks, uhh
Dear Lord come save me, the devil's working hard
This demons stalking me every day against all odds
Frightening, so fucking blinding
Enough to drive a man insane, just call me mundane
I'm rhyming on a song that's not even mine
Trying to rap mine, hoping I don't get caught in time
Cause 2Pac might not have died on the seventh
He's coming back a fucking legend, saving mankind
And this Illuminati is in your fucking mind
Only thing that I suspect, is they ain't so hard to find
So get up off that slave ship
Make our own periods, write our own hieroglyphs

[HOOK: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPower
Nigga nothing less than HiiiPower
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Bobby Seale making meals
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower

[BRIDGE: Alori Joh]
Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We been down for too long, but that's alright
We was built to be strong, cause it's our life, na-na-na
Every day we fight the system, we fight the system
We fight the system (Never like the system)
We been down for too long but that's alright, na-na-na

VERSE 03:
Who said the world revolves around the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that's not such a secret party
Last time I checked, it's these rich families who got all the money
This country is filled with scummy money hungry dummies
And I want everyone to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government has shot me
No conspiracy, death is unforgettable
They play musical chairs once your on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking blinding
Enough to drive Marshall insane, shady lost his fame
The reason Eminem don't want to be that name
Loads that clip and then says bang, the drama he got makes him insane
Product of the late 90's
Tryna to keep my head up, that's why I shun these ladies
Shoot your guns and play me, let's set it off
Cause a riot, blast a police copter, somebody told me the world trades got lost
Cause we been off them slave ships
Got our own pyramids, writin our own hieroglyphs

[HOOK: Kendrick Lamar]
Just call the shit HiiiPower
Yeah nothing less than HiiiPower
Five-star dishes, food for thought bitches
I mean the shit is, Fred Hampton on your campus
You can't resist his HiiiPower
Throw your hands up for HiiiPower
