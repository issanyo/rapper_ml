[Intro]
ArtRAVE
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up
Hands up, hands up, hands up, hands up

[Verse 1]
Hi, I want to come and make peace with you
But they won't let me
No, they won't let me through
I don't mind if they a-arrest me
'Cause I'm wearing my Versace
Why can't we just put on a smile and a buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz?
We all might be sick
Whether it's at first or after a few drinks
We're gonna unite, don't think

[Pre-Chorus]
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the East
I'm from Jakarta-a-a
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya
Prepare, I descend from the West
My name is Lady Gaga
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
'Cause moi seem to have some problem with ya

[Chorus]
Nod if you wanna make love with the enemy
Roll it up, baby smoke it up 'til we're high
(Now Jump)

[Drop]
In a way, exhausting
We're problem solving
Drink 'til she's attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
Talking 'bout diplomatic
I brought my plastic
Making that peace attractive
We're PARTYNAUSEOUS
