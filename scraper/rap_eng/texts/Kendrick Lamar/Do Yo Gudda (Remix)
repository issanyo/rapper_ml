[Hook: Hitta J3]
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Go from your head to your waist
Go from your head to your waist
Do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda

[Verse 1: Problem]
First off, R.I.P fo’
Compton, California in case you didn’t know
All up on Durham with a pretty white ho
Made it out the hood but I’m still psycho
Kid wanna play, better call Tyco
Money always right nigga, no typo
Stay high in the sky like my next flight go
Do my thug, one glove, I’m the next Michael
Gudda, gudda, go bad on ‘em
Synchronize the surprise, have ‘em land on ‘em
Back when bone had the cut in ‘88, no fake
Shout to L little, Doug and Baby Eiht

[Hook: Hitta J3]
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Go from your head to your waist
Go from your head to your waist
Do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda

[Verse 2: Hitta J3]
(Hitta J3) Straps I keep two
They want an explanation, but pigs, I don’t speak to
Nuclear bombs, we’re making the most noise
Boys in the hood, I’mma do ‘em like Doughboy
Go, here comes the sirens
Block is hot as the irons
Swerving on Avalon
I’m reppin’ the deuce like Bobby Johnson
Glocks shoot ‘em like murder
Got both of ‘em like Kirk
Come deep like we on some buckets
Ride through with no interruptions
From your head to your waist, they do it in every city
With my Chucks and my Dickies I’m on Ciroc like I’m Diddy
Aim for his head, knock him right on his Cortez
Not only a dance it’s your regular program

[Hook: Hitta J3]
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Go from your head to your waist
Go from your head to your waist
Do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I’mma do my gudda like it’s my bread and butter
Hit my nigga, on his cell, oh little L that’s my brother
Tell me that a female wanna fuck with the K-Dot
Eat it up, then beat it up, my MO baby, may I?
Two times, I do mines, I knew mines, I do fine
I keep bread and croutons, we bust heads then move on
What’s happenin’? I’m bagging through a bitch and gettin' richer
Bought some toys for the kids, bought a chopper for my nigga, yup
And I’m jiggin’ in the function, I throw my arms up with my index finger pumpin’
A brand new dance coming straight up out of Compton
Little K-Dot from the A-block and I’m Rosecrans thuggin’ huh

[Verse 4: YG]
(Guns shots) Ayy, thats how I sound when I get off
Tree top Bompton, hold on let me get my shit off
Strapped, hope I don’t get caught, hold up, let me shit talk
The 745 and Rosecrans had them pissed off
My gudda keep a slug and a clip that holds numbers
‘Cause I be in the Porsche riding through the bity all summer
Ducking from the under covers on my second level
Still in the streets now because of half you muthafuckas (ay)
Fronting with the Chuck T’s
[This my creed, this my steez nigga on P's]
Ninth grade at Paramount High I was fucking edgy
Socking out any motherfucker that couldn’t stand me
I did my gudda

[Hook: Hitta J3]
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Go from your head to your waist
Go from your head to your waist
Do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda

[Bridge: Hitta J3]
You can love it or can hate
But I got it just in case
Grab and pull 'em off your waist
Like you aiming for his face
You can love it or can hate
But I got it just in case
Grab and pull 'em off your waist
Like you aiming for his face

[Hook: Hitta J3]
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Go from your head to your waist
Go from your head to your waist
Do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda, do yo gudda
Like you holdin’ two straps
Then throwing on your ski mask
Do yo gudda, d-do yo gudda
D-do yo gudda
