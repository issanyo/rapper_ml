[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday, my nigga had told me his brother died
A day before that, his homeless uncle was cold outside
A week before, he seen the cancer in his mother's eyes
Two weeks before that, couldn't pay his rent â€™cause he lost his job
A month before that, he lost the custody of his daughter
Six months before that, her mother said she won't see her father
And this before he did a year when them charges was brought up
I shook my head, turned around, then found a hundred dollars

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yesterday, I invaded privacy of a home
The day before that, my partner had fronted me a zone
A week before, I had loaded bullets inside that chrome
Two weeks before that, I shot them bullets and he was gone
A month before that, I cursed my mother then slammed the door
Six months before that, I hit my woman, she hit the floor
I stormed out, then seen a black Honda Accord
Them hollow tips missed me then hit that little boy

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
So today I laid in my bed, stared at the ceilin'
Closed my eyes, then asked myself how I was feelin'
I analyzed on how a saint can play the villain
Is my life coincidental or just God willin'?
I came to grips, jumped up, looked out the window
See my nigga had that same little boy that didn't know
Bullets is nameless, I guess this was meant for
Me to give them a hundred dollars then trash my pistol

[Hook 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why He keep blessing me
Now I know why, now I know why, now I know why
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why He keep blessing me
I don't know why, I don't know why, I don't know why

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar and BJ the Chicago Kid]
So I can bless you
So I can bless you
So I can bless you

[Verse 4: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Lord help me
Cause I need You
I know this weed is burning
And I'm on drink number two
But it's all to soothe the pain from this
Cold, cold world
Sometimes I think it can help me
But this buzz here is temporary
So I'm talking to You
This sick world will drive a sane man crazy
Dead birds dropping out the sky, daughters having their fathers' babies
And this the news I hear
When my god kids, nieces, and nephews turn a year
I wonder will it get better
A little cheddar will make it better
But the risk of fast cash
Will make last year's Christmas gift be my last

[Hook 3: BJ the Chicago Kid]
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow You keep blessing me
But somehow, but somehow, but somehow

[Verse 5: BJ the Chicago Kid]
If I just keep the faith
I know You'll be right there
Sometimes it may not seem that You are there
But You're there
I feel You're there
You're everywhere
And I thank You for
Protecting me in these streets
From danger seen and unseen
I never know
What happened the night
I wasn't there
Something told me leave so I left
News the next morning
Three guys shot after the club
Awwhh, listening to that small voice
Oh it saved my life
