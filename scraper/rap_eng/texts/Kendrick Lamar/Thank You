(Thank you doctor)
We can never pay you back
All the shit you did for hip hop and gangsta rap
For that (thank you doctor)
Without further adieu
Diggy Doc, this one is for you
I remember growing up
Just a Dogg Pound pup bumping G Thang
It's that gin and juice in my cup
And all I knew was N.W.A
Eazy, Yella and Ren, Ice Cube and Dre
Big Snoop, Warren G, Nate Dogg and raised
Kurupt and RBX, the original gang
Bad ass super fly, I can go on for days
D.P.G.C., that's the way I was raised
And motherfucking 2Pac was my shit
Especially when he was rocking on the Doc shit
Killa Cali where it all started
Legacy, me, I'm just happy to be a part of it
This west shit
It's history in the making, this is the next step
California's best kept, yep
It's your own Scoe, I'm a Y.A gangsta rider
On behalf of the South Central L.A, we wanna

I remember when it all started
On Alondra, in that small apartment
Burgundy carpet and SEGA cartridges
Pop a flick and blunt ashes all on the garments
Momma of off wine cooler, Magic Johnson played Jordan
I was only four, but it's like I heard it before
A house party cracking off of the music the Dr. recorded
And according to my awareness I was more than coherent
A cold listener, mocking that shit like a parrot
My cousins kicking up dust Cripping
They flag, wear it 'round their hand like a mitton
Aiming, use it for leverage
Shitting on Compton sheriffs like "Fuck the Police"
Woofers and gold Rollies
Every swap meet should know me
Cause I copped every record that dropped
Dropped a dub just to hear Doc drop
A jewel for the sake of hip-hop
Who ever have thought the moment I seen you on Bullis for Cali love
Fifteen years later you'd be saving my life, what
