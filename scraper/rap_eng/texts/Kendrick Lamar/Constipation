[Verse 2: Jay-Rock (Kendrick Lamar)]
Activist (Rebel without a cause)
Full clip left you stiff like a mannequin
(Hit him in his temple, left him at the Taj Mahal, What you on)
I'm on some other shit, feeling like I stepped off the mother ship
(We sabotage the government, CIA gotta evacuate when we done)
The state troopers would call off the shooters at dead run

Boogie down Bronx (In a black borrow hound)
Bumping Biggie like (Pac ain't dead)
Two side call it Twenty-two (Ugh)

Straight animal

So raw probably bite off the face of Hannibal
(Protein shakes, acid, and manure)
