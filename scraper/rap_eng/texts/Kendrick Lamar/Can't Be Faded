I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking street

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Its so much drama in the bottom of Watts
Kinda hard bein' jay motherfuckin' rock
Gains cop from bitch niggas that wanna see me flop
It ain't happening captain wait till my album drop
More money, more hoes, of course more haters
When you see, they gon' hate you
I can't be faded, can't be seen
Yea the thangs a blow
Til your head, lord knows where your brains will go
Trigger finger itchy
Rollin' with killas that leave a 6 in your wig piece
Going against me that's blasphemy
I'm a blood, got crips that'll blast for me
Nigga you know my gang, its tighter than blood nigga
I got some because i'm hot like a slug nigga
Walk up in the club with the slug, chained a bitch
Flexed up then, them thangs will spit nigga
You better duck when I aim the shit
I can't be faded, I am the shit
Jay Rock

[Hook: DJ Dave]
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking street

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Went from flipping monkey on bars
Gang-banging, caine slanging now I'm chilling with stars
Grew apart, got the hood on my back
From L.A to the bay, West Coast we bringing it back
Make way, I got the base in the trunk of my car
Middle finger to laws
All I gotta say is fuck em all
I blaze a pound for them niggas behind bar
Free my nigga Poodamey
Homie just stand tall
My nigga two t's the bitch killer
I'm Jay motherfucking Rock you can call me the snitch killer
Them bitch niggas think they got big balls
Come test the board, get smoked like the menthol
I'm more 55 on tracks of heavy weight
I got gats that make your ass levitate
I got raps that'll make your ass stutter me
I got tapped how your bitch loving me
I can't be faded, that's why I'm the most hated
I'm the motherfucking hoes favorite

[Hook]
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking
I can't be faded
I'm the nigga from the motherfucking street
