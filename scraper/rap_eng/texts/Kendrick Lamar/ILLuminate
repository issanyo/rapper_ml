[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Back when I first grabbed that pen
I told myself I was gon' win
And I ain't know when
But it was gon' end up happenin', I want in
So you can take your top 5 list
Dead or alive, and put me after Em
I'm a fuckin' genius
Grippin' my fuckin' penis, livin' this life
You can't tell me nothin'
Still ain't really got no money, fuckin' right
I'm all about that real, about that real
This ain't no motion picture
I tell you how that feel, how that feel
Even when the odds against you
They wanna see me wearin' Polo drawers
Put two chains on, and that ain't wrong
But that ain't me, I go too damn hard
I don't need clothes or jewelry to stand out
Black lip nigga with his hair wild, too damn proud
Been killin' this since Cam made "Oh Boy"
Oh boy, I'm the man now
TDE, put the money in my hand, ain't shit free
This business is quick sand and I won't sink
Put the pistol in my hand and I won't think
Blat, blat, blat! Rest in peace
You just made room for the next to be
I never been afraid to say what I wanna say
When I wanna say it, okay then
Furthermore, we do this for y'all
Rap is stressin', but it pays great
That is, until you lose appeal
And your release date get date raped
Stay safe, hold your head
I got two fish and a loaf of bread
Feed the people food for thought
â€˜Cause we all equal, who'd have thought?

[Hook: Ab-Soul + Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I used to wanna rap like Jay Z
Now I feel I could run laps 'round Jay Z
Nas ain't seen nothin' this nasty
BIG and Pac got it comin' when I pass, too
You got the mic? I ain't the one you wanna pass to
My niggas say my new shit past due
I paid dues, even got that shit tattooed
HiiiPower on another plateau
I know you know we need a few plaques too
The brand new niggas with a attitude
Poppin' in Compton or Timbuktu
I might even sell my new shit for ten bucks too
Too ill when I jot these words
True eel when I shock the world
I know life's a bitch
When you know life's a bitch, then that's not your girl
Cold shit, I'm hot though
Like coal get, Ab-Soul
This is a shift in paradigm
I remember when I couldn't spare a dime
Now I step in with a pair of dimes
On P's, y'all know me
Flow like water, admiralty
The best author ever to breathe
And as we proceed to follow these dreams
I ain't losin' no sleep
No-no on them NoDoz
Just know "no" if it's no dough
So high, but I'm Soulo
Two cups and I sip slow
Takin' my time, we don't just shine
We illuminate the whole show
Now let's go!

[Hook: Ab-Soul + Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Time and time, I drop line for line
But only time will tell
If I ever go Columbine and cop thirty 9's
And cock back and kill
See, the truth is
They wanna know how close me, Dre, and Snoop is
Or how the shoe fits when they choose this
To beat 2Pac, but truth, I give two shits
'Bout expectations or critics hatin'
Shit, I just put Moms on vacation
Bitch, you never know my new location
It's across nations
Court cases get thrown out
So tell the mothafuckin' king dethrone now
I am ruler, I am highness, the Prince Zamunda
I am the shit like what the prune does
Black on black tint like Kinte Kunta
Black is back, bitch, I'm kin to Kunta
Black-on-black crime resent the shooter
Blat, blat, blat! I intend to mute ya
Racks on racks, I don't rap on tracks
Without my A-game, so please don't ask
Me about no pressure
Bitch, with the grip of my fingertip I can hold this coast together

[Hook: Ab-Soul + Kendrick Lamar]
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
They wanna share my light, they wanna share my light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
You can have all my shine, I'll give you the light
