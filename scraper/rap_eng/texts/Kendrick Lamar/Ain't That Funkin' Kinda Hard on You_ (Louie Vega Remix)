[Intro: George Clinton]
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?

[Verse 1: George Clinton]
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I was hard when I started
I'll be hard when I get through
For example if I had to sample some funk like you
Would I be funky too?
And another thing
It ain't so hard, it ain't so strange
If I could be funky like you

[Hook: George Clinton]
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I say, I was hard when I started
Going hard when I get through
Wait a minute, stop, act up, give them the dumb face
I don't think you heard me
It ain't too hard to get, it ain't hard to get with
If you got heart to do
What it takes to make you funky too
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I was hard when I started
Go hard when I get through

[Hook: George Clinton]
I don't think you heard me
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I was hard when I started
And I'll be hard when I get through
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
He was hard when he started
I'll be hard when he get through
Brothers be like
"Ain't that funkin', ain't that funkin', ain't that funkin'?"

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
(Yo, George!
They say they want some more!)
Two tears in a bucket I'll cry with ya, huh
But I can never lie with ya
I can never afford not to afford
I can never put my plans to the side with ya
I can never see a red light like a deer with a head light
I freeze up when I re-up
See I really have patience
If you relatin', only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it
The reason why I hate to wait for it?
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didnâ€™t hurt me
You plead the fifth, I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intention
They say time heals all
But if I could short cut my success motherfunk all y'all
(Straight up)

[Verse 3: George Clinton]
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
I'll be hard when I get through
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
I was hard when I started
And I'll be hard when I get through
Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I say, I was hard when I started
Going hard when I get through
(Ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?)
Wait a minute, stop act up, give them the dumb face
I don't think you heard me
(He was hard when he started)
It ain't too hard to get, it ain't hard to get with
(And will be hard when he get through)
If you got the heart to do
What it takes to make you funky too
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
I was hard when I started
Going hard when I get through
I don't think you heard me
(Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?")
(He was hard when he started
And he'll be hard when get through
Brothers be like
"George, ain't that funkin' kinda hard on you?"
He was hard when he started
And he'll be hard when get through
Brothers be like
"Ain't that funkin', ain't that funkin', ain't that funkin'?"
