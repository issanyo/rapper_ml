[Intro]
Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker & Rapsody]
I feel your energy (feel your energy)
It's coming through (it's coming through)
Took me a century (a century)
To get next to you (to get next to you)
Plus make some enemies (enemies)
Invested in you (invest in you)
So, I feel your energy (I feel your energy)
Invested, pursue (ooo ooo, I never read the 48 Laws)

[Verse 1: Rapsody]
The power of the dussy make a grown man cry
The day I came up out my mama I saw a grown man cry
They say it has magic powers, even Magic ain’t die
Wake you up out ya sleep to take a 3am car ride
He said the booty the only thing between him and God
They love the booty, sacrifice they family and job
Badge make police feel powerful in the hood
Guns make us feel powerful but they don’t do no good
I know my blackness powerful and they don't like that
I know some niggas sold theirs, sit back and watch 'em tap dance
Bombs over Baghdad to have a flag to brag 'bout
Don't make you a big boy, 'cause you got a nice stack
Carolina home boy, you know we keep a Stackhouse
That's power when you know the game, I'm feeling like a Champ now
I went the rap route, homie get out the trap house
I want the power to be able rap 'bout what I rap 'bout
Black child
God, love and textiles
Point, blank decimal
Steph Curry projectile
I saw the goal from 8 miles
With every stone you threw I picked it up and built a powerhouse
Caught a case
I got murder in my profile
Niggas still billin’ me
See, that's just the appeal in me
Respek on my name
Why y'all niggas so emotional?
Power

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker & Rapsody]
I feel your energy (feel your energy)
It's coming through (it's coming through)
Took me a century (a century)
To get next to you (to get next to you)
Plus make some enemies (enemies)
Invested in you (invest in you)
So, I feel your energy (I feel your energy)
Invested, pursue (ooo ooo, I never read the 48 Laws)

[Verse 2: Rapsody]
Power up with the word
I got it from my God
He said a good shepherd don’t trip over what they heard
Let 'em talk the talk until the night you choose to go and purge
I came up when the rest of you struggled and failed to flourish
Conversations with florist
She said I'm good as herbs
Get 'em high, get 'em high from the hood to the suburbs
No one can take your power even if a storm occurred
It ain't man-made, but whether or not you paid don’t help or hurt
It's a perk
Jamla Squad written on my shirt
I got a lane but all the lines around me dotted, I can merge
I can do what you can but you can't do the same with words
As I, now watch my street cred go multiply
They say the streets respect the real ones
No one as real as I
It's just me and young blood, this where I get all of my power
The night I got a chain from Mr. Flowers
I gave it back when I got done rappin; the same hour
I ain't Five Percent, ‘less we talkin the top emcees
And I'm in the top of that, the rest beneath me all cowards
When it spits, look around, it’s meteor showers
I watch the stars fall, fall, fall, yeah this what you call power

[Refrain]
Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Let’s talk about power
Let's talk about yours and ours that paid the allowance
Let's talk about hundred-thousand kids ravin’ and bouncin
Cravin' and drownin in words the day I pronounce it
Let's talk about power
Let's talk about do'ers and dont'ers
The house I built when I was homeless and sleepin' in corners
Sharin’ Coronas and Black & Milds
Donuts in El Caminos
Talkin’ loud, scrapin' and combin'
Residue every mornin'
Talk about legacy
Let's talk about the life of celebrity
Verses integrity
Curse the first one that thirst for necessity
Searching for equity
Verses the earth that birthed us indefinitely
Verse the verse I wrote in jeopardy
Surfin' the laws of the universe and destiny
Church and a God is all that’s ever been ‘head of me, aw
Let's talk about my power, the golden child was
Granted to be on your cameras and store counters
He’s bananas, competitive, we can dance
See the damage, no more fo’ he peed his pants
My second LP had real niggas on POTUS lawn
My seven trophies is at my Granny's and Heaven arms
I'm in Jamaica like “wah gwaan,” my feet  is out
My hair is long and patois comin' from my mouth
Me, I go outdoors it's time to bless up erryuhn'
Rude boy, me, I ain't worry 'bout it, fearless
I shot niggas, then shot movies ten years later
Dear God, why you show me so much favor?
Amongst the haters and wickedness (wickedness)
Deliver this child from evil convictions and frivolous (frivolous)
Debates about who's the preeminent  emcee of the millennium
And it's all for the Benjamins
And I'm all of y'all nemesis
And I'm all in all happy none of y'all can fathom who Kendrick is
The only One that ever did wrote the Book of Genesis
Motherfucker, that's power

[Refrain]
Into my world
There's this power that pulls us closer
Deeper in love
There's this power that pulls us like magnets
And may the force that be with us forever
Be right here to guide us
Your sensitivity is very sensitive to mine

[Outro]
Hey, what up, cuz? Man
It's ya boy Crunch, man, checkin' in, man
Heard you playin' in a couple weeks, man
Holla at me when you get this message, though
Holla at me, it's important, holla at me
Oh yeah, I forget to tell you, I got a new toy
Got a brand new toy
So you know what I'm gettin' ready to do to it, baby
Turnt out that chrome on that paint, baby
That chrome comin' in June, baby
I been chicken chasin' all summer, ya dig me?
I been chasin' chicken all summer, pocket muscle
That's the new thing now, pocket muscle, a.k.a. chicken
