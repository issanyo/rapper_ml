You're like a needle in a haystack
I wanna sit you where my face at
Lunch with a few Mai-Tais
Purple kisses on my tie
Life can leave a dick loved
Now you gettin' this dick, love
I'm lookin' for you with a flashlight
I wanna feel what a real fat ass like
No injection, I learned my lesson
I walk it like I talk it, baby this pedestrian
Runnin' through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy like pop, go give me a burner
Got shot like pop
This can be detrimental
T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You're cotton candy, I need a fistful
I'm often antsy, hope that convince you
