[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
Straight to the block, to the hood, to a spot
Cocaine to a rock, duece duece in a sock
Every dollar closer to a drop
Every drop is closer to a cop
Every cop is closer to a cell
Hit the cell your ticket right to hell
No job, no bail
No fam, no mail
Institution another nigga fail
Go from pussy to a prison tale
Fuck that, I quit while I'm ahead
Ship my music off with Amistad
Turn it up and here the ghetto pledge
Live righteous nigga like my brother said
King Tut, Martin Luther, Malcolm X, but ima shoota'
Top ramen, knowledge for the noodle
Finally gettin' praised
Yeah kudos
Doing bad, still love the need
Connect said it's something up his sleeve
Said, I rather bust off them keys
Yeah nigga birds and the beez

[Bridge: ScHoolboy Q]
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Wanna do a song, but its hard to carry on
And my daughter hungry sitting home
And my girl said she feeling lone
I can't tell its over in her tone
Only time I call is for a loan
She be stressing, so depressing
Always worried every time a lil nigga gone
Stay strong for the future, stick together, yeah suture
Get a couple wipps, yeah kunta
Schoolboy but gangsta was his tutors
Say money be the root of evil, look around and see what it do to people
Veins full of heroin using pcp inject the body with a needle
Lord help us, swear to god, dope dealers, get a job
Keep it real this shit ain't really cool, being in a cell, you ain't alive
Niggas quick to show out over cheese, love to help the devil do a deed
So I rather bust of them keys? yeah nigga birds and the beez

[Bridge]
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

[Hook]
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Q I wanna see you do your thang
Entertainment business living limelight
Hop on every track and move them trains
Show these motherfuckers that you been tight, then they ever been
Its evident that you intelligent but you can't escape that life
And for you my nigga
I would sacrifice myself to make it just to see you hold the mic
And hit the stage and rock the set
But its hard to change when your from the sect
Won't you think about it nigga, life or death
Life of crack Iâ€™d like to hang you by the neck
Do you wanna see the boys in jet, or you wanna see them run way jets
Fly to Singapore one way that, tell the pilot we got stacks on deck
Swear to god, its hard out here for a young black men to live
If you dont do it for yourself, then please do it for your kids
My nigga won't you tell Michelle, I love your daughter
Please dont let her grow up life without a father
Look at what you bought her, money couldn't buy
All she need is love, put that shit aside
At the same time know they got to eat
Know you got to hustle, make ends meet
Gotta make time, gotta get a grind, gotta push the line, HTC, no a.c
And the block hot, you keep runnin', cop say freeze
Blue pill, red pill, choose now, birds or the beez

[Bridge]
Birds and the beez
Birds and the beez

[Hook]
Tired of the same ol' shit, niggas they faking it
Niggas out here living foul
Better yet they flagrant, keep these niggas right up out the game
Keep these niggas right up out my lane
I just wanna do this fucking music boy, leave this dope alone and count my change

[Outro]
Count my change
Count my change
