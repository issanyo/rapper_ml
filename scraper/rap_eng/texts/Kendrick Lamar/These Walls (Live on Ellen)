[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Life is full of up and downs
Twists and turns
But somehow we keep on steppin'

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
These walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I’m not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I’m just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated, every nook and cranny
I mean it's still amazing before they couldn’t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I’m here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around demolition might crush

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]
If these walls could talk (Step)
I can feel your (Step) reign when it cries, (Uh) gold lives inside of (Step) you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I’m in it, (Uh) I love it when I’m in it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
These walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that’s my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls
I’ve been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I rather miss them
I rather call, I rather diss them
I rather fall on you, put your wall up
Cause when I come around demolition go crush

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]
If these walls could talk (Uh)
I can feel (Step) your reign when it cries (Chi-town step), gold lives inside of (Step) you
If these walls could talk (Step)
I love it (? step) when I’m in it, I love it when (? step) I’m in it
(Uh)

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
And reality is
Sometimes through these ups and downs
You gotta know when to lead or to follow
Keep steppin'
Chi-town

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
If your walls could talk, they’d tell you it’s too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Build accessories and stash them on the are
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your homie to save you
Homies to say you're reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
(That sentence so important)
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hour of the morning
About her baby daddy that's currently serving life
How she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she messing with famous rapper
Walls could talk

[Hook: Anna Wise, Thundercat + Bilal (Kendrick Lamar)]
(Uh, hey)
If these walls could talk
(Yeah)
(I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you)
If these walls could talk (Yeah, hey)
(I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it)
(Yes)
