[Verse 1]
K.Dot, you know that he's hot
I can do rhythm, hip hop, I can do pop
We talkin' 'bout the black, we talking 'bout the brown
We talkin' 'bout the white, it don't care who you around
It's all about the positivity when you with energy
If you knew me, then you know that God had witnessed me
If you see me then you know you can't intimidate me or be me
You can see we go for the energy
(K104)
K104
Best hip hop and R&B, I be up in your store
You know I'm rocking out, I got my people around me
We in the building and you know definitely you can't down me
And if the children...
(Dede)
And if the Dede, she called me cute
I walked in the building, I said yo, she got on boots
She got on earrings, maybe baby girl got on hoops
She got that long, brown hair, it's wrapped, yeah, she cute

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
He say I'm killing this beat, K.Dot he never been weak
You know I got them flows and plus I've always been cheap
And they talk 'bout strip clubs, I talk 'bout ladies and hugs
We talking 'bout more abuse, we talking 'bout these drugs
We talking 'bout my lady to the right, she real fly
Say your name again, girl, don't be shy
(Lady Jade)
Lady Jade, she aways talkin' 'bout gettin' paid
And the haters they in our way and they getting sprayed
Cause the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
They're always gonna play, play, play, play, play
No matter what they say, say, say, say, say
We're getting paid, boss, paid, boss
