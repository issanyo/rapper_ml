[Intro: Rick Ross]
Uh, you know what it is
I'ma make sure everywhere you go you see me, baby
You hear my voice?

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I never had a problem with your old nigga
It's just how we mob, we don't know a nigga
She put me in her past and she moved on
But I keep her sexy ass in my new songs
We all make mistakes, we gone fight
There to wipe a nigga tears in the late night
She wanna cum before me, tell her, "Wait a minute!"
Now we on the water, elevators in it
Dancing to another artist, I'm the one who pin it
Ghost, with the most, see no competition
Working in the club and guess who gotta tip out
Long money, I'ma show you just what Rick 'bout
Rims on the coupe, baby, haters wanna sue
Me and you against the world, what you wanna do?
What you wanna do? What you wanna do?

[Verse 2: Miguel]
Frustration (watching you dance)
Hesitation (to get in them pants)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question: Am I moving too fast?

[Bridge: Miguel]
Cause' I ain't leaving alone- feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know

[Hook: Miguel]
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time

[Verse 3: Miguel]
Temptation (is calling your name)
Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game)
Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
Impassioned (is what I'm making you feel)

[Bridge]
[Hook]

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch cause your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
State your name, live in the moment
Itâ€™s your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never get a first let away

[Verse 5: Kendrick lamar]
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them big trucks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die - in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it

[Vamp: Miguel]
Or waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby it's alright
Baby it's alright, baby it's alright yeah
Oh it's alright now
Alright. Oh yeah
I don't wanna waste my time, no
I don't wanna waste no time, oh no
I don't wanna waste your time, babe
I don't wanna waste our time, Oh my time, Oh whoaaa, now

[Hook: Miguel]
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh yeah)
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time (come wit' me baby)
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three (yeah it's just a short drive home from here)
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time

[Vamp 2: Miguel]
No-no-no. I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight

[Outro: Miguel]
Let's go, shit we only live once right?
I mean, where's the fun in forever anyway?
