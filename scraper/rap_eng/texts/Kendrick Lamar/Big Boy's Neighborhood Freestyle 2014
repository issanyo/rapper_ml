[Verse 1]
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a good feeling, y'all
Gotta see how Iâ€™m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals
Tenfold, the liberal concept of what men'll do
20 on 6, he didn't hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu, my American tongue was leery
Hopped out the gas station, a homeless man with 100 grand
Who passed me just asked for 10 grand, stressing about dry land
Blue skies, powder blue skies then crack open
Piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn't believe it, told him beat it
Contributed money just for his pipe, I couldn't see it
He said "my son, temptation is one thing that I defeated
Listen to me, I want a single bill from you
Nothing less, nothing more"
I told him I didn't have it then close my door
Tell me how much how much a dollar costs?
And this a freestyle beginning
And if you know me you know K.Dot TDE winning
We are the champions, we disagree
You can't see it then you best believe
This the cypher, I need y'all to throw some words up

[Interlude]
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't, and you don't
And you don't, and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
They wanna know the question
K.Dot, everybody stressin'
This is the message that I'm kickin' too wicked, straight from Compton
If you come around my city you'll get stomped in
The neighborhood Watts and Long Beach
Boy, you out of reach
This is TDE, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock
Schoolboy Q, we hot, you not
This a freestyle off the top of the dome
Big Boy city, you know my home
I'mma represent every time I come to the lab
If you wanna see me, homeboy, get the cab
Cause you can't ride with me, you can't see the streets
You can't see us, it's TDE
My homeboy Dave gon' fly you straight in
Sippin' on that juice and gin and that's a classic
Coming straight from Dre and Snoop
If you want us please jump inside the group
Because you don't deserve it if you don't not
This is straight hip hop, this is off the top
And when I rock you feel it
If it's us and then you hear it
Please consider that the best agree
The top number one emcee

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
Now when I flip it I flip the beat as my enemy
You thought it was taming me, on point like a widow's peak
Deliver the bars that everyone agree
They say the number one emcee, best believe
I love the pianos and I love the flow
I love the snare drum, I love... oh, I can't cuss on radio
Because if I do they just might let me go
I'm side to the best, I ride to the best
I represent the West, please don't try to test
Because you will get disabled
From best of flows I know, you hate it
Everybody wanna rock, but they can't
Because they come from the street of Rosecrans [?]
We drop it off the top of the backboard for real
And that's a swish, that's a net, alley oop
I feel that we are the champions and these Gods'll stomp you
I come through your block and crash everything that you want or put out to
And if you know my flow then you know how it go
If you know Death Row then you know Eazy, then you know Dre
Then you know Snoop and you know we don't play
But anyway I need y'all to flip the beat
Because my words always compete with the best

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
I said we don't stop, boy, we run hip hop
Boy, we run rap, boy, this is Top Dawg
D-O-T, D-A-W-G, K-D-O-T, C-P-T
L-B-C West, W-A-T-T-S, Jay Rock, he don't play
Niggas and guards, projects
What you want? We can collide anytime with the biceps
But this ain't no strong arm, buddy, this just a freestyle
Off top of the brain, boy, you know I get wild
You know I'm so foul, you know I'm off of the top
You know this hip hop, you know I cropped
The roof from the birth of the Earth
And I've been doing this since church
With the small slacks, with the soft suspender
If you rapping like that, homeboy, we suspend ya
We contenders, we on the top off the map
We on the top off the globe and yeah this real rap
From the bottom of the soil since Adidas and Run DMC
Sprinting like cheetahs, we run this game and beat me
And [?] man on the beat right now
He gon' flip it and please believe
Every 16 bars is like ours
And if you want it then we 'bout to take charge, what's up?

[Verse 5]
Tonight's the night I jump off my shit
Deep cover on the incognito tip
And every time the words flip the emcees step, but I don't trip
I keep walking, keep pushing and put 'em in a coffin
You often looking for the best, I'm here
We talking, you looking for the stress, you there
Keep walking, you looking for the West, right here
You stalking the flow, you often to know
I want y'all to know been doing this since the days of Death Row and Ruthless
I've been ruthless, the coupe it been roofless
You spit, the words be toothless
But it get like that because you feel it
I got Rikki on my side and she chillin'
Big Boy on my side and he willin'
They say that he writing my bars, forget it

[Interlude]

[Verse 6: Big Boy]
It's my lyrics, it's my pen
It's my paper as I begin
I've been writing for Kendrick for a long time
And he's been reciting my rhymes
So for those out there who didn't know
Big Boy gets on the mic and he kicks an ill flow
Then about 10 years ago I got this call
From a little dude, I said "yes, yes, y'all"
He said "uncle Big Boy, I wanna start rapping"
I said "what's up, little homie?", he said "I wanna start trapping
I wanna start capping, I wanna start hitting the studio"
I said "slow down a little bit, bro"
He said "holler, I wanna rock the spot"
I said "what's your name?", he said "my name is K.Dot"
I said "K.Dot, okay, I think I feel you
But this the way I wanna instill you
First off let me write what you gon' say
Record it and then press play"
He said "okay", it was very rude that I took K.Dot on
He was one of my little students
So he just sat in class
He was looking at me, said "do I get a pass?
Do I get an A,B,C,D,E or do I fail?"
I said "you doing well", his head started to swell
Then all of a sudden he came to me
He said "there's this dude in Compton that has TDE"
I said " Top Dawg? Hold on, that is my partner
Don't stop right there because I think [?]"
When the dude is coming with a contract
But I said "hold on, let me look at that"
I said "okay, he want this, he wants these points
He want this, but don't smoke any joints
You my lil partna, how old are you on the scene?"
He said "big boy I been a student, about, I'm about sixteen"
I said okay keep going, and then all of a sudden
He started doing uhh, he started doing these shows
And he got poetic, he got energetic
Spotetic, all those -etics
Any more -etics, any more edits
Then o-etics, and then a o-etics
So then I came back and he was still in class
And then I gave em that pass
I said TDE, the real Macoy
Can't forget Jay Rock, can't forget Schoolboy
And so I put the whole crew together, but from the background
Before I got in they had a lack sound
