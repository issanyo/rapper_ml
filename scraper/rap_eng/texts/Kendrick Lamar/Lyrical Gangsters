[Verse 1 Kendrick Lamar]
When I kick it, I kick it as if the beat was my enemy
You have thought it was ten of me, on point like a widow peak
I deliberately give 'em dillies that do what it do
Painting a picture like doodling, dude you ain't shit but doo-doo
In the city where the semis get pointed at him, them and you
You can hide, you get, if you want to, I do karate moves
But the crouching tiger just might get broken down by a writer
Yeah the passenger hopped out, but you got shot by the driver
There's a killer like everywhere, so why would you take it there
Neighborhood terrorist got the terror when this people scared
That's why my intelligence tell me to keep a banger
Tell me "fuck you" I'll tell you fuck you back with my index finger
I can flip on some killershit but I'd rather keep cool
Keep it so remind it try not to be a pussy like you
Nigga that Cali cold attack, Cali on my back 'till my torso break
This is where it's at, that's gangsta

Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta
Gangsta, gangsta, gangsta

[Verse 2 Papoose]
I tote a Smith'N I'm so malicious I blow your wig in
Make 'em close the stitches, Hell's Kitchen, I'm throwing dishes
This is spoken wisdom as I journey a poet's mission
I'm up lifting, my flow is gifted
Should come with a bow of ribbons
Road to riches, load the biscuits let's go the distance
I'm blow and listen my car how why you with a broke ignition
They so suspicious, low and vicious with no convictions
Juries making their own decisions they want us to go to prison
Cold adrenaline I got this soul like a poet's living
So is spitting it's like I'm co-existent to prohibition
I'm a dressin critics who say these widows the best as spit it
Disrespect the spirit, or the artist who rap with lyrics
Mother-F statistics they rap with metaphysics
And they yeah simplistic, they stay out as repetition
Show some recognition
Heard your album my best of missed it
Best that ever did it
Papoose is the definition
