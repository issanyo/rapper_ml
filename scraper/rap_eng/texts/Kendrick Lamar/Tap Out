[Intro: Jay Rock]
Redemption like, we been lit
Face down, ass up, vicious (woah)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Backdrops, smoking on the bombest weed
Backshots finna go down when we leave
And I got squad in the back, oh yeah, yeah
And a foreign car in the back, oh yeah, yeah
Looking like stars in the back, oh yeah, yeah
Can't tell me that I'm wrong (wrong)
Can't tell me I ain't on (on)
Bottle straight to the head and I'm going
'Til I tap out (ooh) tap out (ooh)
Tap out (ooh) tap out, ohh
She wanna play 'til the morning (morning)
And I'ma give it to her like she want it
Tap out, until she tap out
Until she tap out, ohh
She wanna play 'til the morning (morning)
And I'ma give it to her like she want it

[Verse 1: Jay Rock & Jeremih]
Only when I slide to the back
Closed eyes in the back 'cause I'm high in the back
Got a text where you at, ayy
Only big flex where I'm at, ayy
Bouncin' on the highway
Head on the highway, I only do it my way
I ain't gon' play with it, I'ma work it out
Stand up while I lay in it, couple hundred thou'
Dead mans in the safe with it, know what I'm about
Sip some, blow an 8th with you, bring it to the house
Fuck you in a car in the back (oh yeah, yeah)
Fuck you so good, call back (oh yeah, yeah)
For real though
How many fucks I give? Zero
Eastside Johnny now, mama maxed out
And I put that on mom and them, let me tap you out (ohhh oh)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Backdrops, smoking on the bombest weed
Backshots finna go down when we leave
And I got squad in the back, oh yeah, yeah
And a foreign car in the back, oh yeah, yeah
Looking like stars in the back, oh yeah, yeah
Can't tell me that I'm wrong (wrong)
Can't tell me I ain't on (on)
Bottle straight to the head and I'm going
'Til I tap out (ooh) tap out (ooh)
Tap out (ooh) tap out, ohh
She wanna play 'til the morning (morning)
And I'ma give it to her like she want it
Tap out, until she tap out
Until she tap out, ohh
She wanna play 'til the morning (morning)
And I'ma give it to her like she want it

[Verse 2: Jay Rock & Jeremih]
Slide on the 'Gram lookin' for a new biatch
Don't fall through, back up cause I'ma be aiight
Put it in my face, I'ma lurk though
Ass like Bernice Burgos
Capricorn, Libra, Virgo
Slidin' down your tongue like Merlot
Zodiac, girl what's your zodiac?
That's your boyfriend? Well, I know he mad
How you feel?
I might be too raw for you, too real
I know your homegirl wanna pop pills
Ducked off in them Hollywood hills
I be on bullshit, we be on bullshit
Pull up on me one time, know you ain't doin' shit
I be on the front line, what's happenin'?
Ballin' when it's crunch time, I ain't lackin' (ohhh oh)

[Chorus: Jeremih]
Backdrops, smoking on the bombest weed
Backshots finna go down when we leave
And I got squad in the back, oh yeah, yeah
And a foreign car in the back, oh yeah, yeah
Looking like stars in the back, oh yeah, yeah
Can't tell me that I'm wrong (wrong)
Can't tell me I ain't on (on)
Bottle straight to the head and I'm going
'Til I tap out (ooh) tap out (ooh)
Tap out (ooh) tap out, ohh
She wanna play 'til the morning (morning)
And I'ma give it to her like she want it
Tap out, until she tap out
Until she tap out, ohh
She wanna play 'til the morning (morning)
And I'ma give it to her like she want it
