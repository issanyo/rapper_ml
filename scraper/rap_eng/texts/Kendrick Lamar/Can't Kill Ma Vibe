Its AKAD now yeah
AKAD now oh yeah (Tumany 7NiM$)
And U say Da M
Da M!
11:24 iNc baby...

Bitch you can't kill my vibe, cause I'm so damn live, so alive
It is light that I shine, it is bright in my mind, then I write them in rhymes, tighten every line, on the mic I will shine
And I know Nottingham will wish I was raised there
But in the Noosphere to me, it was made clear
Why my birth was the first of the year according to the new world calender
The birth of the new world challenger
My smirk ain't a compliment, nah its a challenge bro
Your work must be relevant, there's must be talent bro
Got my eyes on the game like d screen of a monitor
Good morning world
Guess you still wiping the cold off your eyes
I'm on the rise so don't fuck up my high
High above the sky you can't come up dis high
Never sold crack but i want a piece of the pie
And yeah I came to the world through the ports of England
Third hour of day three, I reached the cosmos region
A son of the dawn, the sun to the moon, Ousama Saddam
The Enemy you hate, the energy you take
From enmity you've made is eminently a waste wait (hold up)...

Now back to this joint
Back to putting them niggas on point
Like the dot of an i, or the tail of an y
Like Bob Marley, its some natural mystic, don't ask me why
Or I'mma just lie, base on a truth, but there is no truth, based on a lie
Boy am killing this bitch, she ain't killing my vibe
Yea I gotta kill this bitch before she kills my vibe
So bring out the missiles, the rockets, the launchers, and bombers
Suicidal monsters and lets fall Olympus like a movie
I know they gon' be like who's he
I'm more like a baby with two teeth
Will do anything for the game am 3T
They can't wait to televise me on 3D
I kick some conspiracy shit am Bruce Lee
Snoring on me then wake the fuck up
The slept-on ones are stepping the fuck up
I know you hear the twist in the beat
The cords of the Kora, the strings of Africa
The cores of the Torah, stems from Africa
Keep this shit on repeat
I ain't paid for the beat so I need no receipt
See my man MoudSound emailed me the beat
And these bitch ass dudes looks like female to me
Bilingual kid spitting from English to Twi
(laughs) chaley yenkor
(French)
Mais si "je le suis" 3x
Le maitre du franglias
Le qui t'empeche, D'etre un examplaire
Car je les enterrent
Un vol direct en enfer
Ils sont fais en bois,moi jsuis fai en fer
Bref, je tue tous les sons que j mets sur le net
Et les mecs ki croient que je suis un traite
Mais les meufs elles savent elles me doivent une baise
Et au traite,C'est le sila et on reste les maitres
Comme le Yakuza, si tu trahir on t'enleve la tete haha Ok

Conakry ouias je sais que vous entendez le bruit
L'arbre a grandi venez manage le fruit
L'ensemble est lepi et kente, mais la centures est LouisV
Ils ont voulu me chasser, maintenant ce sont eux qui fuient
A l'abri, je le suis
A la vie, je la vie
L'enemie, je l'elimine
Et la suite est a suivre...
Ahh!

And I been spitting dis way since 02
And I don't give a fuck if you don't know tum
Tum doesn't know you doesn't intend to
Send me a friend request I won't befriend you
Follow on twitter I wouldn't trend you
