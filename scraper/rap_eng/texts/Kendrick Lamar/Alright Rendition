Chrs:
When you know, we've been hurt,been down before
When my pride was low, looking at the world like where do we go
And we hate Po Po
Wanna kill us dead in the streets for sure
I'm at the preacher's door
My knees getting weak and my gun might blow
But we gon be alright

Verse:
The young boy asked
Who gon be the one to set us free
Who gon be the one to top the greed
Who gon be the one to heal the streets
The Po Po's kill
But we do too and
We put our hand up but they keep on shooting
We go to the judge but we keep loosing
But we gotta keep moving
I put my hands up to the sky
And say oh lord do you mind
I know the dead can't be revived
Can you help us stay alive
Tryna do good and do whats right
It's dark out here, im tryna be a light
They tryna take away our pride
