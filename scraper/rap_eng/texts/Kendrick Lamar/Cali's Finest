[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Peep the style and the way the cops sweat us
Artillery got a gun for every letter
In the alphabet while your family in pajama's
I'll be stepping in your house like Alpha Beta Gamma
I’m creeping
Got a dorm something decent

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Fuck a fist fight the shells bubble
If its beef got the desert double
Still got the work in the duffle
Eat sleep, shit, breathe, Hustle
The game bang russell simmons
Gun tucked under the linen

[Verse 3: Kendrick]
V12 stock engine (yeah)
Don’t worry he’ll be dead in a minute
59 seconds past then I let them shots blast
And I do it quicker than a horny 8 grey class
And sit them in the water like Alcatraz
Don’t bother with the god mc

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Godfather, build big dro like Rasta, ya bumbaclot
You got chickens we raid ya spot
Kick in your door waving’ the 4 4
Let it blow like a Chicago snow storm
Even if its 20 below still bear arms

[Hook]
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
(where we from) California let me see those hands
We don’t stop, Ingle wood  we won’t stop
It’s compton in the house

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
K-Dot Jay rock nigga shit your drawers
2 deep g rob in your honda accord
Squeezed off on em paramedics tried CPR
And 3/4s of his heart the young boy coughed on em

[Verse 6: Jay Rock]
Who Shot ya ?
5th sing like Sinatra
These hollow tips we call em heart stoppers partner
Red and black impala ride street like patrollie’s
Coached by OG’s to stay low-key (what else)
Sip 40’s and stay with a 4 T

[Verse 7: Kendrick]
My pockets bo key
Middle fingers up to the compton police
I’m a threat to the law and your flow got too much baking soda pa
It’s pissing your fiends off they be like “now raw?”
I’m outta here K-Dot got that powder for years

[Verse 8: Jay Rock]
So focused we aim straight
4 shots will knock off 6 braids
Been doing this since sixth grade
You wack niggas need first aid
Got me twisted like dreads, I run money with two legs

[Hook]
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
(where we from) California let me see those hands
South Central we don’t stop, East LA we won’t stop
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
(where we from) California let me see those hands
South Central we don’t stop, East LA we won’t stop

[Verse 9: Kendrick]
Its 08 let me tell you what they tryna do (what) clone humans
I’m so dope, they want me as two
What are you doing, respect you more if you called it a truce
But we burn white flags, so its probably no use
They tell me we hot, I’m looking like who?
Probably in heaven is the only time you couldn’t show me some proof
Until then keep stepping’ while I act a animal in the booth
You looking at the one man sitting zoo, Pity the fool thats denying the truth
I’m the word like bible study you heard class is over my toddlers

[Verse 10: Jay Rock]
Top Dawg Enterprise
You went for ? get sprayed like insectiscide
Count hundred dollar bills for exercise
No money printer, just paper splinters
Yeah you hating ass niggas cry a river

[Hook]
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
(where we from) California let me see those hands
Carson we don’t stop, Longreach we won’t stop
Jay rock, K Dot nigga piss yo pants
(where we from) California let me see those hands
Watts we don’t stop, East Oakland we won’t stop, (nigga)
