[Verse 1]
Oakland and 2Pac
I move oak, you see, I'm nothin' like [inaudible]
Thinkin' they hot cause they homies said they was a few times
Which is too many times of lyin' to you, they tellin' a lie
The only time I lie in the booth is when I sleep in it
Record twenty-four hours, these niggas better get they bars up
I bench press this rap stuff
Got it locked like handcuffs, I threw away the key
My cool is on, she love my AC
My jewels is on and I wish one of y'all'd try ride me
I shoot and have you land between the sheets with the Isleys
We push the coupe like a [inaudible]
The helicopter's comin', realize there's nothin' behind us
Behind me, Your Honor
I fuck over these beats with no condom
This ain't rap, it's really a porno, rewind it back
[Inaudible], it's back to definin' a loss, correct, they don't obey
Y'all ain't nice, nigga, y'all just okay
Yeah, they're more than a little [inaudible]
I'm Mike Jordan in his prime, modern-day Isaac Hayes
[Inaudible] equivalent to the theme song of your career
Study my craft, you ignorant
I do it without a pen and a pad, just inspiration
Somethin' y'all never had
If my pockets is somethin' you tryin' to grab
See, I pulled out the rocket and peel you back like scab
You old news, old dudes, get out my way
Let the young boy come through, don't mention my age
Shit, I'm on a mission for pay
And you astronaut niggas just crowd in my space
Look, you're not in my atmosphere
You can act like you're here
But actually you ain't accurate fuckin' with this music biz
The industry like, 'Fuck it, let the music be his'
No theme park, I'm not tryin' to amuse you kids
Small shark, Jaws is here, jump in the water
Do we really fuck with President Carter?
My reply's that I can't stay away from the bosses
Got the biddin' war poppin' like a auction
Five or ten labels like, 'What he hatin' for?'
Except the zeros and more
Remember havin' Aftermath sittin' on my door
Money in front of me, I couldn't open the door

[Verse 2]
I'm so far ahead of my time
I got people five years from now pressin' rewind
I'm hardly impressed with y'all
I hate rappers, where the true artists at?
If it ain't a good picture you draw, don't bring it to the architect
Often y'all arguin' about who got next
Claimin' y'all runnin' the game, niggas is barely walkin' yet
Hoppin' all over beats without going through trainin' camp
Try studyin' a few greats, then maybe you'll be where I'm at
Your songwritin' ain't great, your mixtapes' medioc'
You recycle the same quotes, you're not switchin' your flow
Your flow in the same place
Don't just [inaudible], expand
Try to be more creative, perhaps
My rap friends, I ain't sayin' that you wack, psych
Like a invoice, I'm just statin' the facts, right?
You'd have to count the metaphors I write
In fact, you've been a factor you've feared your whole life
No TV show, don't compare me with them
That's like Jaws versus Nemo, a gorilla to a chimp
A Jordan versus Kukoƒç
A Tony Montana with blow in his nose to a Nino
