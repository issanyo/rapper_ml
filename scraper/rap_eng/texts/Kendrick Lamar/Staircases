[Hook x2]
Staircases take me high
Escalators take me high
Ladders take me high
Elevators take me high

[Verse 1: Buddy]
Started at the surface so my goal is up
Cause once you stay down then you gon' get stuck
And I'm just trying to climb and grind, the same time
Dangling off rooftops is what I call our hangtime
Walking through the hall, counting my flaws
My ego got caught in a elevator wall
Got it out, raised it to the rooftop, damn
Got to take the ladder cause the escalators jammed
Made it to the top but I ain't even stopping
I said a prayer and a wish and turned my skateboard to a rocket
I'm gone, to the skies, I'm nothing more than another rebel
But I'm still trying to take it to another level
Get up out the ghetto, maybe hop up on the shuttle
Jello with a piece of metal, my foot on the pedal
People say the world could fit into a little pebble
Then give me one good reason why you think we should settle
(Let's get it off)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Look inside my eyes, you can see the universe fly
Deep inside my pupils the aliens camouflaged
Another way to shoot you, my mind is of mass destruction
I'll drop a gallon of Henny in the Big Dipper then dive
Bitches skinny dipping in my orbit
Ever seen a Martian? Gorgeous or some U.F.O. Porsches
I live inside the air plus I wear Air Jordans
So the mic is always near me whether swaggin' or recordin'
Journey on my voyage, you know the sky is the limit
But it's ironic that method never applied to Kendrick
I catapult over your telescope and when I'm finished
I grab the fire that's burning from Mars to light an incense
This rapping's just a metaphor and I deserve a medal for
Writing another metaphor, about ambition
I envision me taking off astronautin' myself
Fuck the world, I'll beat that bitch with the Orion's belt

[Bridge: Buddy]
As I'm floating all alone
I looked up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone
Getting high so I'm not sinking
As I'm floating all alone
I looked up and I start thinking
In a moment I'll be gone
Getting high so I'm not sinking
Getting high so I'm not sinking
