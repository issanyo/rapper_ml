I rose from the stoops on magnolia/
Coupe whipper stack folder /
My mind Store data like Mack folders
Seen Life takers from Mack holders/
Never know where life takes ya til ya older/
It ain't all fabulous
Summertime shootouts show ya
Fresh Nghs turn to foul odors
Make you colder sometimes bolder
Chip on shoulder resembling boulders/
Been hot heating up like last notch
On stove tops
Getting top from old thots
Ciroc gold dot got us all hot
Allow me to introduce the ending of juice to
To mumble rappers and nincompoop
Like my hoes Foreign like lambo coupes
Don't talk much just crash box like bandicoot
Dope game
My rope chain like golden noose
Counting new money with old recruits
No new faces accept hundreds with the new faces
Getting face from new faces I met in aces
Expensive tastes got me pissing out aces
Black friends all black benz like we racist
Live life like a marathon ...it's no races
It's about how you finish.. not the places
It's about your performance not the stages
Only care how the story ends skip pages
Louie V Victorian
Skip Payless
They discuss how I ball
Skip Bayless
On me bet all chips I'm like vegas
When I come back we all rich I will save us
My last will and testament is this feeling
Willing in a million so resilient
My mind state is priceless can you afford this
Handsome when I Hand sums my hustle Gorgeous


If I back smack a fuckboy n***** I'm a make it look gorgeous
If I run down on these fake rappers I'm a make it look gorgeous
Like pull up hoPe out (cock back sound)
Make it look gorgeous
You won't take me out my element
Yah n***** is irrelevant
