Frustration (watching you dance)
Hesitation (to get in them pants)
Come closer baby (so I can touch)
One question, am I moving too fast?
Cause' I ain't leaving alone feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time
Temptation (is calling your name)
Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game)
Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
Impassioned (is what I'm making you feel)
Cause' I ain't leaving alone, I feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch but your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die in it
Then reincarnate as a fly gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics
State your name, live in the moment
It's your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never get a first let away
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them bittracks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it
Or waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby it's alright
Baby it's alright, baby it's alright yeah
Oh it's alright now
Alright oh yeah
I don't wanna waste my time, no
I don't wanna waste no time, oh no
I don't wanna waste your time, babe
I don't wanna waste our time, oh my time, oh whoa, now
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh yeah)
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time (come with me baby)
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time, waste my time
