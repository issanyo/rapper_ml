Abazaba

You know we get in the studio and do what we do best
You know
Beautiful shit
But this time around I wanna do something different homeboy
You feel me my nig
Hop on them keys real quick my nig

(Hook)
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Yea hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm playing shit that my girlfriend'll like

(Verse 1: Kendrick)
Check me out
She say she love it when it sounds like this
She tell me Kendrick put it down like this
When I listen I wanna close my eyes
And feel your lips
Let your lyrics wrap around me and grab my hips
So enticing
On point like the helmet of a Viking
Kicking up dust like I'm hiking
I ain't calling a woman a bitch on this one
I be calling my woman so I could get some
She fresh off work and Lord knows it was hard
She take off her shirt and Lord knows that I'm hard
Composing myself, tryna remain content
She had a long day and plus I know she wanna vent
Now she could talk about her boss and I can give advice
Or she could take the panties off and I could eat the (PIE PIE)
Fuck that, option number deuce
On the kitchen table while I play this tune
You know why?

This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
I'm Playing shit my girlfriend'll like
Hahaha yea
This shit my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain these other hoes tonight
Aba, this shit my girlfriend'll like my nigga

Look

(Verse 2: Kendrick)
We be in the car, bumpin' my latest jam
I recorded at the studio around 10 p.m
It's a club banger
Catchy hooks and 808's
I even threw a bridge on it just to play it safe
The first 8 bars, she's lovin' the track
Even rewinding it back
Soon as the beat drop
The way she react she like "That's Hot"
'Til I start talkin' bout how many hoes I got
How many I fucked
How many I've misled just to get a nut
Like a squirrel, in pursuit of lunch
Uh
Though I'm on some clich√© rapper shit
I know she thinking are my lyrics that accurate
She's so cool doe
Don't downplay her just to fuck up the mood yo
She'll still play it even though I sound rude yo
And disregards to the provocative records
One thing that I do know

This something my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I'm playing something that my girlfriend'll like
Told you that my girlfriend'll like
Other hoes tonight
Soul

(Verse 3: Ab-Soul)
This something my girlfriend'll like too
Kendrick I got you

This a great idea
This'll be my girlfriend's joint right here
So I'mma kick the shit she like
It seem right
Like a pair of jeans that fit tight
Around her cute booty
I like to hold her from behind in line
At the movies
Her body language gets read
Like a ruby
Cause she a work-a-art
No help from Julie
I'mma beast and she such a beauty
I love her, she know that, I place no one above her
Far from an arc, but best undercover
Kodak moment every time we in sync
Like a iPod plugged to a USB
It's just you and me
I mean me and her
I mean her and I
It's plain to see, affirmative
So if you ever need me
You know where Herbert is
On her mind
Like she on mine
Uh
Play some shit my girlfriend'll like
Cause I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
She do music too, this shit my girlfriend'll write
If she was me talking bout her
DJ

Play some shit that my girlfriend'll like
I ain't tryna entertain them other hoes tonight
I wrote some shit that my girlfriend'll like
Now I'm sho' to get some cuddy
