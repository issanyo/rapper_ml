[Hook]
If I gotta ride
Then you's gonna die

[Verse 1]
I hope niggas ain't really tryin' to break my bones
Cause if you are make sure you know a nickname you want for that tombstone
Play hard as a rock bullets can break stones
Break bad boys down like Jenny did Sean Combs
I'm hot as an oven you just a pressin' comb
I'm not impressed homes you should've stayed home
And prayed that rooftop blocked you from gettin' shitted on
I gives a fuck if A&R's don't pick up the phone
I swear there's no one like me but if there is then I gotta long lost twin or they made me a clone
I don't care about friends I was made to be on my own
I came in this world by myself and I'm leavin' alone
Hopefully with a crib that I can call my own
With a backyard the size of the fuckin' Georgia dome
Pop you popped shit and I might pop your dome
Give your homies a reason to make a memory song
Niggas swear that they love when the beef is on
Knowin' that plummet time the only time he'll roam
You better hold your breath I give you workin' death
And recommend the gun be your chaperone
I know young niggas that look up to Al Capone
And they look 17 but I swear that their mind is grown, shit
I'm so grown and the reason why I write this way
Pac and Big be ghostwritin' my songs
You can play the boss but if you get shot
From bein on top then homie that's your loss
I'm nice wit it
I'll pop your man then leave some money on him so it can pay for his funeral costs
The niggas tryin' to get money like Fort Knox
Either from the rap shit or back down to the cut rock
And you can play a baller but deep inside you know you just an actor
Yeah, somethin' like Rick Fox
You ain't a thug homie you just a fox
In the midst of werewolves somewhere in the boondocks
And I'm really from the streets
So if I ask for beef homeboy don't bring me no pork chop
I turn your skin to pork homie with one chop
With a rusty switchblade that's dirty like bum socks
They say the flow is crack
So wherever I rap best believe you can call it a dope spot
I swear

[Hook]
If I gotta ride
Then you's gonna die
