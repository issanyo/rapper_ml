[Hook]
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
And opened my eyes
I had no idea who you were
Should have took my time
But my love was blind

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
You was caring, you was sharing, you was thoughtful, you was sweet
You was upliftin', you was different, you was commited, you was me
You was supportive, you was honest, easy going
You had promise, that you'd never break a promise
You was life, you was free, from the bull shit
... I think

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
You was insecure, jealous hearted, slight retarded
I was nauseous, I was marching back and forth, and you was forcin' me to forfeit
Female fraudulent, you female doggin' it
It's like extortion on my heart and shit
I probably fell for it, cause you was gorgeous
Now your course, done ran it's courses, and of course you know I'm exhausted
Time you know I surely lost it
Should of been wiser, should of been cautious
Should of been tighter with my game
I chose a dame that chose to entertain drama and what remains
Is hate, so fuck your fucking name
You fake and live in a hall of shame
Materialistic, egotistic, thirsty bitches
Open house, and mouth for niggas to stick they dick in
Thought you was different, but you wasn't
Take that back, I wish I would of just fucked with your cousin
Ass was fat, but never mind that
We out here fussin', fightin'
Ask your friends to give advice, but they just like you
Clashing like some titans, could have broadcasted on pay-per-view
Promise that you never break a promise, should I trust you?
Now you only go for condoms, on late nights just because you, with the bull shit
