[Intro]
Nobody pray for me
Not even a day for me
Way (Yeah, Yeah!)

Ay, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse on 'em with some counterfeits
But now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives
In fact, I'm downin' this
D'USSÃ‰ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy yo' ass the world with my paystub
I know that it's good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
A.M. to the P.M., P.M. to the A.M., funk
Eat up your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
Its levels to it, you and I know, tell 'em be humble

Sit down
(Hol' up lil' , hol' up lil') be humble
(Hol' up) sit down
(Sit down, hol' up, lil')
Be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) tell 'em sit down
(hol' up, lil') be humble
(Hol' up) sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, lil') sit down
(Hol' up lil') be humble
(Hol' up) sit down
(Hol' up, sit down, lil')
(Sit down, lil', be humble)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, lil' ) , sit down
(Hol' up) be humble
(Hol' up) sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)

Who dat (um) thinkin' that he ' on man, man? (Man, man)
Get the (um) off my stage, I'm the Sandman (Sandman)
Get the (um) off my (ay), that ain't right
I make a play blowin' up your whole life
I'm so so sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural I wanna feel some stretch marks
Still will take you down right on your mama's couch in Polo socks, ay
This is way too crazy, ay, you do not amaze me, ay
I blew cool from AC, ay, Obama just paged me, ay
I don't fabricate it, ay, most of y'all be fakin', ay
I stay modest 'bout it, ay, she elaborate it, ay
This that Grey Poupon, that Evian, that TED Talk, ay
Watch my soul speak, you let the meds talk, ay
If I kill a (um), it won't be the alcohol, ay
I'm the biggest (um) after all, tell 'em be humble

Sit down
(Hol' up lil' , hol' up lil') be humble
(Hol' up) sit down
(Sit down, hol' up, lil')
Be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) tell 'em sit down
(hol' up, lil') be humble
(Hol' up) sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up) be humble
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, lil') sit down
(Hol' up lil') be humble
(Hol' up) sit down
(Hol' up, sit down, lil')
(Sit down, lil', be humble)
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, lil' ) , sit down
(Hol' up) be humble
(Hol' up) sit down
(Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up)
