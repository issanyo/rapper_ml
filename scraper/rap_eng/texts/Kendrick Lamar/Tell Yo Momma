[Intro]

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Once again it's on
Hey girl, yeah shake that thong
Afterwards put your name in my Nextel phone
You ain't gotta leave your man alone
Just come to my yard if you want this bone
Take a hit, I'ma have you switching homes
Searching for me you'll be ditching homes
Cadillac truck, yeah sitting on chrome
All debts paid I ain't sitting on loans
Hey ma, I'm loving the way you move
Plus you working it in them high heeled shoes
Yeah I'm kinda tipsy of that gin and juice
Lace the weed a little bit, give my high a little boost
Head to the spot so we can get loose
I wanna pop cherry, I ain't talking 'bout food
You looking so good in that sexy suit
Oh, I'ma tell your momma on you

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
Oh, I'ma tell your momma on you
The way make it move like a stripper do
Oh, I'ma tell your daddy on you
How easy it is to get next to you
Meanwhile, I'ma let you get wild in here
Meanwhile, I'ma let you get it hot in here
Meanwhile, I'ma let you do your thing in here
Meanwhile, I can keep a little secret, can you?

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
It's K-D-izzle
T-U-nizzle
How I get down, make moves upon the ground
Stand on the block with the K not the pistol
Fuck with Jay Rock everyday it's official
Seen shorty run away, not invisible
Fuck your mental a nigga love your physical
It's that simple I'll show you what a pimp can do
Put you on corners and have niggas renting you
Like real estate, see a bitch, fuck her face
K.Dot never hate, only dig, penetrate
What you know about that thing cupping your waist
Legs in the air duct tape
Your man [?] aim straight
Know where the pope went?
I'ma send him to that same place
If you was smart you would touch base, like home run
Then grab pipe when the plumber come

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
Jay Rock, K.Dot, yeah we keep the place jumping
Girls on floor straight grinding, humping
Subs in the back yeah the speakers straight bumping
Start set trippin' then my boys start dumping
Watts so [?], chain so icy
Fuck casual, looking smooth in my whitey
Back in the days, yeah them girls they like me
I rolled with Doom Dog, now they all on my cock B

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
All wanna watch me
All wanna jock me
Take 'em and send 'em straight to bed
When they stop me
Have 'em with sheets over their head, like a Nazi
[?], head given properly
Wax on, wax off, Mr Miyagi
Let me know momma, I show you where your thighs be
Stick in all the time just like an IV
Your so called thick shit, that don't surprise me

[Hook]
