Yeah, follow me, uh

Picture Kendrick, one of the greatest emcees
Roamin' the coast like cellphones on airplane mode
I been at bat for so many years
Now I'm out swingin' like open marriages
Carry this terrorist flow, say that I'm arrogant
Stop playin', thinkin' back to rhymin' over computer mics
Knew I was tight the moment the speakers had broke
I dipped and dabbled in chronic, but never knew I was dope
You see, my uncles is killers, but never knew I could smoke
A rapper like a .357, do worse enemies
Was God-given, but now I'm God, hate to intervene
I sic a lyric on you like K-9's from the police
Let it rip through your briefs, till it bite through your culo
I'm Cujo, (you) sumo actor, (me) sumo rapper
Heavy in the game, follow my name, K-Dizzle
A twenty-two-year-old dream, got now
Like a person place or thing hands down like 6:30
You heard me? I'm a motherfuckin' problem, puto
Give me respect, I hold it down for DJBooth.net
And they tell 'em K-Dot got next
And they tell 'em K-Dot got necked
From your baby momma
On my momma, brain like a genius
I'm travelin' to Venus
Where aliens got pistols 'round they V-necks
Snub-nose, Kleenex
I suppose I done drove artists to a place
Where the daily deceased sleep at
Competition comin' up short like a dwarf
But, of course, I'm a short fuse ready to blow
Go 'head and put your gun down, we can go toe-to-toe
Mano e mano, you ain't ready, I'm deadly as plec disease
God-given, you trippin', I've walked the Seven Seas
Moses, cold as they heart, cloned as art
Foamin' at the mouth, wildebeest slaughter opponents
'Bout business when I kicks this, ridiculous symphony
Tick-tock, boom when you infants give me some room
Central and Rosecrans, Compton don't raise killers
They raise Conans with survival tactics
You love drama? Well, welcome to the land of theatrics
Even a preacher be packin' like role managers damage your goods
Cameras roll through the hood, tryin' to get that footage
Even newscasters come to your block when you wouldn't
This the city at it's best, have a seat, hold your breath
A breath of fresh air, DJBooth.net and Dot
Kendrick Lamar, K-Dot, that is, ha-ha-ha, ha, yeah
