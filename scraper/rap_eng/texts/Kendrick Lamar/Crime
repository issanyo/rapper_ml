[Verse 1: Mayer Hawthorne]
Waterfront
Sunshine
A little weed
A little red wine
Then come
The 5-0
Citation
It's illegal

[Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne]
We just wanna party
We don't mean no harm
Don't wanna hurt nobody
But they make it so hard
We just wanna party
Just wanna rock all night
Don't wanna hurt nobody
No need to be uptight
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime

[Verse 2: Mayer Hawthorne]
Backyard
Tune's right
Girls dancin'
In the moonlight
Then come
The one time (woop woop)
Regulation
Gotta pay the fine

[Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne]
We just wanna party
We don't mean no harm
Don't wanna hurt nobody
But they make it so hard
We just wanna party
Just wanna rock all night
Don't wanna hurt nobody
No need to be uptight
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Pour up another shot of Hennessy, my tendency to start the party with
Probably hit that Bob Marley, I ain't with that Molly shit
Represent my nigga, bang your hood
Bloods and Crips in the same building, it's all good
I'm looking at this pretty fine thing rolling with her friend
Hoping I can make her mind change, jump inside my Benz
Let me get it cracking
Conversation turn to plenty sexual frustration
Fuck-faces looking at her, hard to not be impatient
Oh, really though?
You drink? You smoke?
Get a case, get a 1/8, fly high not coach
G5, sit back I'll drive, let me know
On the couch, on the bed, on the floor, say go
Say when, in the wind, we go
We toast to the game, no games, we both really grown
I'm saying, you playing, I mean I dance
To my own beat, to the beat now flip your hands and
Let the smoke burn, let the smoke burn in your vein
When it's your turn hit it twice then say my name
Say my name, say my name, I appear like Candyman
Dark chocolate, vanilla, I tell you this is Candy Land
This is Candid Camera, there's no pauses allowed
They don't understand us because we won't turn it down
Middle fingers in the air, this is truth and double dare
300 drunk muthafuckas in the holding cell

[Chorus: Mayer Hawthorne]
We just wanna party
We don't mean no harm
Don't wanna hurt nobody
But they make it so hard
We just wanna party
Just wanna rock all night
Don't wanna hurt nobody
No need to be uptight
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime
It's a crime
