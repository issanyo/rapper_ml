[Corey Holcomb]
Hey, boy. By the time I got there, I was already two bottles and three pussies-deep. [Laughs]. You hear what I'm sayin'? It was on, boy. I was barely standin' up by the end of it. Aw, yeah, it was cool, man. We was gettin' down, havin' a good time, dancin', groovin'. Everything was smooth. They was showin' your boy love. [Laughs]. But somethin' was off. I knew somethin' was wrong, man. You know, you get that feelin' sometimes. Like, when a real, cute woman is showin' you genuine love. Ay, that ain't right. But that's when I saw Kendrick out there gettin' down wit' my lady. Man, I spent the night at her house and walked her daughter to school. You know, that means you obligated to me. But I wasn't trippin' too much, you know? Like I said, I was already three pussies-deep. You know, I got respect for your boy, Kendrick, a little bit. Yeah, everythin' was cool, man. Well, shit, man, ain't nobody told me.
