[Lyrics from Snippets]

[Intro: Colin Clive]
It's alive, it's moving
It's alive, oh it's alive
It's alive, it's alive
It's alive in the name of god
Now I know what it feels like to be god

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm not a newcomer, I'm a new wonder elite

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
K-Dizzle
I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
I'm crack in a pot, I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You cannot test no key in the Tesla

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
Bitch I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras

[Hook: Kendrick Lamar]
It's alive
