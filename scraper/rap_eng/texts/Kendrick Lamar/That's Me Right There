Yeah, that’s me right there
That’s me right there
Nobody gotta tell me how to do it
I took it from this life, I can hold it down
I can’t even lie, I’m the truest

Not many know what it takes
How to handle this lady, I own it

We ain’t ever goin' no where
That right there
That’s me right there

Jasmine only ride Aladdins like nananana
Then I’mma cuff that like one time
Only one time I’mma tell you, I’m

[Pre-Hook: Jasmine V]
Baby believe me this won’t ever stop
I can make this look easy, got this on lock
