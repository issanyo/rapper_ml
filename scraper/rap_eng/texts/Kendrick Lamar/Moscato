[Intro]
You gotâ€”you got some more moscato?

[Verse 1: Ab Soul]
Yeah, she's a mean girl, I'm a nice guy
We all know opposite attract, like a rail road, and I like
You to do anything you please when you're with me, momma
Let's head home, crack a bottle of the Sutter Homes
And hit some trees, why not?
Where your head at?
Hope it's in the gutter like mine, not where you find rats
Talking 'bout where you find ecstasy
Come on have a little bit of sex with me
Can I hit it in the morning, 'til the sun has fallen
Like a new born, baby you stallin'
You know you want all this long dick
Oh shit, might want to make you my misses like I lost it
Peek-a-boo
Lady your smile light up the room, Pikachu
You could put a nigga in a tomb (one) peek-at-you
Let's pop this cork, let me rub on your neck
'Til Victoria's secret get all wet
And Victoria's secret safe with me
Let Victoria's secret leave your legs
I know you had a hard day, baby, relax your mind
Shit, soon as Christ turned water into wine, everything was fine

[Chorus]
When things get hard to swallow, we need a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it
We can even do it tomorrow, just bring a bottle of Moscato
(Haha, I know we said P&P Baby)
Puts me in the mood for your loving
(But now we on something new)
You love it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Guess whose back in this motherfucka
Looking like a motherfuckin' Chi-town pimp, alright
Make my money flip, make my money flip
Make my money flip, I been in the gym all night
Came in the game with a dollar and a dream
And a AK clip with an infrared beam
I pop that trunk, make everybody scream
Put a missing punk on everybody's screen
Ain't nothing changed but the ends I'm holding
My dick is big and my nuts is swollen
I don't know if you've noticed but a nigga be rolling
With a bad bitch and the bitch be rolling
Dolphin pills and Moscato spills
Everything she need to get her thrill
No Hennessy on the bartender bill
Just good wine and a good place to chill
I feel I might get loose tonight and fuck your girlfriend
I mean I feel she might come through tonight, plus her girlfriend
In a 5-Star suite with a 5-Star freak
Slinging that dick while baby eat
On her punani, ooh mommys, look at yours bodies, I'm geeked
Having a good time
Put my pain in a mothafuckin' bottle
A chain and a diamond ring don't feel the same
If a nigga ain't got his eyes closed (eyes closed)
I know you had a hard day baby, relax your mind
Shit, soon as Christ turned water into wine everything was fine

[Chorus]
When things get hard to swallow, we need a bottle of Moscato
Puts me in the mood for your loving, you love it
We can even do it tomorrow, just bring a bottle of Moscato
(Haha, I know we said P&P Baby)
Puts me in the mood for your loving
(But now we on something new)
You love it

[Bridge: Ab Soul]
I said, it's a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp with a glass of Moscato
What up ho, what up?
I said what up ho, what up?
I said, it's a celebration, clap clap bravo
Lobster and shrimp with a glass of Moscato
What up ho, what up?
I said what up ho, what up?

[Outro]
Sip slow
Relaxation
That's our motto
Soul
