[Verse 1: Nitty Scott]
Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so don't rush me
Love is patient and now you gotta trust me
To take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm or an unborn
Carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for his start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasn't built in a day
And diamonds need a while before they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
I'm paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste and she said it wasn't ready
She stir it up slow and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
I'm just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta stall the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses
Nah, I take my time and compose this

[Hook]
They say greatness get better with time
They say concrete roses hard to find
Sit inside my room, and let these thoughts bloom
It's a secret garden in my mind
Flower child

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
When you bustlin' hustlin' for the numbers and
You missed the journey if you climbed too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need a balancer
I want that legendary like excalibur
Chasing calibers liberated as a bachelor
Traveler, never falling victim to these calendars
Rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting on my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when I'm talking bout chess
Tryna do more when I'm talking bout less, I stress
Quantity ain't always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
I'm resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I won't stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your momma's yard

[Hook]

[Outro: Nitty Scott]
They say greatness gets better with time
So why expedite my prime?
See I'm just a lilac tied to the earth
Exuding the fragrance of light and birth
So respect my photosynthesis
My petals, my stems, full of nourishing flow
You thought this was a love song, but no
I just need you to let me grow
