[Intro: Yhung T.O. & James Blake]
Meet the man in the mask
Meet the man in the mask
All those days and all that stays and
I don't keep it, I won't be here for it
All those days and all that stays and
I don't keep it though, I won't be here for it

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Yes, Lawd, huh
Hail Mary's in the sky (Hail Mary's in the sky)
False prophets get buried alive (alive)
Head on the throne, 'cause that's where I reside (reside)
Ways of the world, the weak won't survive
Somethin's in the water (the water)
Ayy, my nigga, we lawless (lawless)
Please move with caution
Who set the fairway? (fairway)
Damn right, I need all this (all this)
Yeah, Jack, I need all this, eyy

[Post-Chorus: Ab-Soul & Kendrick Lamar]
Hittas acquitted with fingerprints on the Glock
Screamin' we gon' make it like two-thirds of The LOX
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Pow pow, becomes, blah blah

[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
Blood on my hands, I'ma need hot agua
You gon' meet yo' maker, I won't say it in Patois
Hope I strike a nerve like a package of matches
You might wanna bypass, this smoke ain't gas trick
A prince-turned-pauper tryna to do like kings do
Sweatin' in chess games, tryna move like kings move
You should slow your roll before you drown in a moat
He tried to channel balance, but never found the remote
Killers on the prowl still juggin' off a lick
Still aâ€” with a double for his *bleep*
Common politics, everlastin' mayhem
Draw to stick you for your figures, that's how they hang man
So what's your game plan if you got one?
You aimin' at passengers with a shotgun? Whoa
The aftermath is you in the scope
It's warfare, is war fair? No
You understand? It's probably better you don't
Just keep a dock on standby, charter a boat
Ships set sail and planes depart
The big picture's in motion, are you playin' your part?
Before the lights get dark and the curtains get closed
Are you playin' your role?
As told by an organized criminal
And general get off my genitals, I got your general

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
Hail Mary's in the sky (Hail Mary's in the sky)
False prophets get buried alive (alive)
Head on the throne, 'cause that's where I reside (reside)
Ways of the world, the weak won't survive
Somethin's in the water (the water)
Ayy, my nigga, we lawless (lawless)
Please move with caution
Who set the fairway? (fairway)
Damn right, I need all this (all this)
Yeah, Jack, I need all this, eyy

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
I had to be about 9 when I first had seen it
Low-lows pulled up outside of the Ralph's
After a car show at Dominguez
They had a disagreement, they had to air out
Just another day in Del Amo
Fo' sho, man down, mando
(Thank) thank God I never had to knock your partner off
Or be another casualty of war, amen
There's four footprints in the sand where I walk
I never claimed to be a saint at all
Four Russians trippin' with hollow tips
And a Kalashnikov, aimed at y'all (kla kla kla!)
No, Soulo, ho, kept it clean
Ridin' dirty, jury would have gave me thirty
Herbie love buggin' out, hit the target blindfolded
Electorial college devoted
To hit the score, to write the score that's not a metaphor
Ragin' against the machinery, tapin' up the scenery
You gotta keep the piece to keep the peace
Got dough, squad up and mopped the block up for a cleanin' fee

[Outro: James Blake]
I don't need you to change
I don't need you to change
Yourself (get, get away, get away)
But I've got to get away (get, get away, get away)
I've got to get away (get, get away, get away)
For my health (get, get away, get away)
(Get, get away, get away)
Be as free as you can (get, get away, get away)
Be as free as you can (get, get away, get away)
Away from me (get, get away)
I tried to be a saint like everybody else
