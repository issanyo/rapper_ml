[Intro]
K-Dizzle

[Verse]
I rap with a Pyrex in the projects
I'm crack in a pot, I'm a prospect
I'm a pirate on a dock full of dope
I can dissect any rapper
You could vote for the Lochness
You can not test no King in a Tesla
Bitch, I ride like a freight train parked outside
And my young niggas came with the extras, ah

[Hook]
It's Alive...
