[Verse]
It's been a week already, feeling weak already
Got me at peak, possibility of what could be
Situation is heavy, I've got to prove
On February 26th I lost my life too
It's like I'm here in a dark dream
Nightmare, hear screams recorded
Say that it sounds distorted but they know who it was
That was me yelling for help when he drowned in his blood
Why didn't he defend himself? Why couldn't he throw a punch?
And for our community do you know what this does?
Add to a trail of hatred
2012 was taped for the world to see
Set us back another 400 years
This is modern day slavery
The reason why I'm by your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your son jumped in your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in the rain
I'm on the dash with my bible in the trunk
Had the vodka on the top
How come I can long time
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
How come I could make it popular?
Puff on what I want
See I'm living with anxiety
Giving up sobriety
Cussing with his sister
And playing with society
Justice ain't free
Therefore justice ain't me
Try and justify staying, obituary
Why you wanna see a good man with a broken heart?
Once upon a time, I go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinking to myself
Hollow tips is all I got
Now I'm drinking by myself
At the end of Section Park
Caught you when you walk besides your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your damn door and blowing out
Every piece of your brain
'Til your spine drip to your arm
Cut off the engine then sped off in a wraith
I said Hiiipower, one time you see it
Hiiipower, two times, you see it
Hiiipower, two times you see it
Conversation for the entire nation this is bigger than us
