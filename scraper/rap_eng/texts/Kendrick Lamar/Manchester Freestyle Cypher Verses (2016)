[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Two emcees, that's all we need
This a freestyle off of the top, proceed
I come from the West
You know I gotta get 'em
Flow sicker than cancer in Manchester
Yes-ugh
As we rock from off the top
You know I got the sure shot
I make it hot
I go from Compton to Watts to the suburb-ian-ghettos
If you want to see me everybody say hello!

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo!, give me that motherfucking mic back
Tryna battle
I'll put your little ass in the saddle
How you don't see before
You can't see me
Never better emcee that's fucking shorter than me

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Yo, yo
I'm-ma use that mic
I'm-ma do that right
I'm-ma spit this all day and all night
Anybody wanna come under pressure?
Anybody wanna see God(?)-bless ya
I love ya 'fro, you got the head of the future
Rocky, good kid, mad city (good kid, M.A.A.D. City)
I was there-ah
Now I had to switch it up and get the braids
Now I had to come through
Flow sicker than AIDS
I gotta get paid, I gotta get laid
I gotta come true, gotta be real
I gotta be proof, gotta be you
Gotta be us and gotta be due

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Step up, emcee
If you want time right now
Come right now
And shine! (x6)

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
Hold up!
I gotta leave y'all with at least a few bars
It's not about the women, the money, stars, and cars
It's not about the clothes, the hoes
Know who we are
It's all about the mentality
Love making chords
Your life makes you bruised and battered
But that don't matter
If you wanna know
Fuck all that chitter-chatter
Do your thing, let 'em sing
Let the gun-boy reign
Bite the sound, I just came and blazed
What's up!
