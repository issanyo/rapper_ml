My love for music, my passion for it, you know that's my life, you know? It's not just a job for me, it's truly a lifestyle. I wake up, I think about or a verse, I go to sleep I'm thinking about it. I walk out, throughout my day, you know I think about music.

During the Revolt interview, Lamar was also talked about the important role that music plays in his life today.

It's just something I breathe now, I didn't always breathe it. I always was a fan of it, but now I really live it. That's inspiration within itself.

We'll be going into the middle of December, which is a blessing, a lot of people don't get the opportunity to be on a major stage in front of that many people and be able to learn. I'm just taking it all in stride and being a student of the game because Kanye [West], he's a great performer. I'm not too shabby, like I said, again, but I'm just there really to challenge myself, grow myself and take that next level.

During the brief interview, Lamar was also asked about what his next steps are.

Really getting back in that studio, locking in. Just keep continue with music, continue challenging myself. I don't really got much goin' on outside of music. So, that's about it.
