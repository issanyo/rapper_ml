[Verse 1]
You never knew a plug, plug, plug, a plug like this
Sophisticated gangsta, watch me thug like this
Snatch your, uh, in a club like this
Seven zeros, need my pub like this
Stuck in a rock in a hard place
I am thinkin' I won't bump y'all up, well, I am
I got to get my thing off
My style come from Devin the Dude, Kurupt, 2
And James Brown with his fist crossed
I fluctuate the vocals like Prince Rogers
Whoever thought a billionaire come out of Compton?
Multiply simple logic, it's rules you can follow
If Dre ain't motivation, I don't know who is
Gift and a curse, maybe them shoes is too big
Or maybe I'm too pessimistic to know I'm gifted
Chasin' hood rat brownie points and bullshittin'
I dropped the four on 'em, scrapin', hopped a four on 'em
Grab my dick and pour on 'em
Yeah, homie, I'm still talkin' that whoop-de-whoop
Hoppin' out on my enemies, I know who to shoot
Back when my homies where I need to be
Such a familiar sceneries, I smell the gun smoke
I watched a homie watch his son smoke
I seen the sun set on my set
I seen one 'Ru and one Loc, one slip and one played him close
Everythin' subject to change
Nowadays, the Compton Crip car kill each other
Faster than an opposite color
Homies whack out everythin', you're dead, homie
It's your mother, your uncle and brother
If God was a Loc, he'd probably had one comin'
Damn, that's fucked up, I guess it is
When you can't trust not a soul inside these streets
I made a video out there in Copenhagen, so the homies can see
To let 'em know it's more than just Pamela Lee
They said, "Good looking"
Paused the video the moment his phone ring
That fast dollar was his only problem
No matter how many times I showed him the Eiffel Tower
The block was home and Africa was too far for power
Then I knew

[Bridge]
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't and you don't
And you don't and you don't stop

[Verse 2]
This feelin' is unmatched
This feelin' is brought to you by adrenaline and good rap
Black Pendleton ball cap
We don't share the same synonyms, fall back
Been in it before Internet had new hacks
My innocence limited, the experience lacked
Ten of us with no tentative tactic that cracked
The mind of a literate writer, but I did in fact
You admitted it once I submitted it wrapped in plastic
Remember scribblin', scratchin' diligent sentences backwards
Visitin' freestyle cyphers for your reaction
Now I can visit a stadium, pack it the fastest
Gamblin' Benjamin benefits, sittin' in traffic
Spinnin' women in cartwheels, linen fabric on fashion
Winnin' in every decision
Kendrick is master and mastered it
Isn't it lovely how menace has turned attraction?
Pivotin' rappers, finish your fraction, runnin' pure magic
Thank God for rap, I will say it got me a plaque
But what's better than that? I know everything
I know everything, I know myself
I know morality, spirituality, good and bad health
I know fatality might haunt you
I know everything, I know Compton
I know street shit, I know shit that's conscious, I know everything
I know lawyers, advertisement and sponsors
I know wisdom, I know bad religion, I know good karma
I know everything, I know history
I know the universe works mentally
I know the perks of bullshit, that isn't meant for me
I know everything, I know cars, clothes, hoes and money
I know loyalty, I know respect, I know those that's hungry
I know everything, the highs to lows to groupies and junkies
I know if I'm generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I'm rewarded, well, that's God's decision
You know, they know that from Compton School District
I give it to the kids, don’t gossip ‘bout how it was distributed
I, I, I know how people work, I know the price of life
I know how much it’s worth, I know what I know and I know it well
Not to ever forget until I realized I didn’t know shit
Big Boy, what’s up?

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I don’t give a butt  about no politics in rap
My little homie Stunna Deuce ain’t never comin' back
So I got to go hard every time I jump on wax
Bump what they talking ‘bout, this here is where it’s at
Look, I came in this game, I stuck my fangs in this game
I wore no chain in this game, my hood, my name in this game
Now I double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
I’m stickin' to the scripts like, “Yeah, 'em Benjamins can cuddle up”
I skip, hop, I drip-drop, I flip-flop with them white tube socks
It go sherm sticks, watch me burn this
That’s what the chronic smell like when them chemicals mix
Fifty-homie salute, I’m out to Compton Zoo with the extras
El Cos, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans that eff with me
Nobody can eff with me, tell y'all to eff with me
Jumpin' out the Caddy, uh, just got my dick sucked
The little homies called
They said, "The enemies done cliqued up"
Oh yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell 'em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everythin' is everythin', it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin', scramblin', football numbers slanderin'
Homie’s name on paper, you snitched all summer
The streets don’t fail me now, they want to put the game in town
From Compton to Congress, it’s set trippin’ all around
Ain’t nothin' new but a flow of new DemoCrips and ReBloodlicans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin’?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Tell me they profit to fuck with you
Nobody can fuck with you, Obama said, "What it do?"

[Bridge]
Can I get one more?

[Verse 4]
Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin’
Motherfuck if they did, then a nigga'd be platinum
Y’all priorities are fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don’t ask about no politician at award shows
No, don’t ask about my, hoes, no, don’t ask about my foes
'Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I’m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
“K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora’s box”
I box ‘em all in, buyin' land stock
