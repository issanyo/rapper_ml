[Verse 1: Dido]
Don’t wrap it up in gold
Don’t hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don’t fly it like a kite
Between the clouds
It needs no excuse
Just bring it down
Let eyes that are in pain look upon it
In all its glory

[Chorus: Dido]
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

[Verse 2: Dido]
For every voice that is lifted
In reverence and pain
Show us now
And let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stand
And let us be alive
So we know
That we’ve done all we can
Let hearts that are frozen get to see it
In all its glory

[Chorus: Dido]
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

[Bridge: Dido]
And let all that is lost be forgotten
And it will pass
So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
But today I'm overly dedicated, I'm 'posed to be
A testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flying with me
Misery loves standing behind its company, well
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it's a appealing to pop a pill, that's a downer
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
I heard when you see a dove, that's what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings, but I'm still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say

[Chorus: Dido]
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
