[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Picture perfect, I paint a perfect picture
With these lyrics that I'm kicking
I'm a west coast chemist
I'm a B-L- double O, D shit you niggas know me
You niggas know me when I pull up on your block with a couple homies
Sip that light spliff who’s that snatch ya bitch
Nothing but a g party like Pac in 96
But its 07 no half steppin’
Get outta line no mercy nigga we blast weapons

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
California economics got me hooked on it like phonics
When the beat drop I drop a bomb like atomic
Got my heat cocked like some type of bird
Big pimpin’ weapon under the fur
Limping’ like a prosthetic leg
But still play the back like bike pegs
La fitted cap pulling your wig back
With Glocks in it g roc black tinted
What side you claim fuck yo gang

Yeah Yeah thats what I’m talking bout nigga

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I got more bars than singular
Keep a four five yeah seen me a
Shoot to kill we on the brooklyn bridge
Range Rovers and Coupe Devilles
Middle fingers up to the NYPD
Locked down in them cells thats where they want us Gs
Feds watching got us on camera got a good lawyer he cold like Canada
Nigga I’m a animal, raps new hannibal, king of my jungle, eat you like antelope
Product of the projects nigga I’m the shizznit
You don’t wanna test, give you lames the business
Watts California pay hell a visit, where a wrong turn can be your last visit
Pit Bulls on

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
Five in the morning I’m up cooking it up
Studio filled with coffee cups
I don’t sleep I just lay down and wink
I work like slavery was just last week
Somebody told me that every label
Got this button that beep and when I rap it go off
And thats when they know to push their album back
I don’t allow cats around the big dogs
You can’t see me, the force between us is thick fog
I never hang up when the money calls unless it be a emergency that my family involved
Don’t get your life involved, we’ll shoot without playing basketball, get your ass mopped
Like Lysol, you light MC, I’m heavy on the track
If you see my flow you would say its obese
