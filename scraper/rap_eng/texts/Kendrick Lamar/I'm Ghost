[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
They leave the city behind us
Straight out of compton
You need a compass to find us
Water’s that blue
When people called me ‘your highness’
Prince of Zamunda
You get in tune with the lions
Away from the rumors
As in those who assume what I am
Parked on to Hollywood
To Hawaiian
Bitches I’m in the reach of 90 degree climate
It’s me, beautiful sounds
At CCYN’s
Cheer CLK slash G like I’m driving
I’m a LAMBO
Hopping on
Cool on auto pilot
Smooth ass
Babies bottoms
With Johnson baby powder
Hey coward
Suck a big dick
With aids on the tip
No homo
Y’all just make me sick
I’m ready for war
I got my riffle
My SWAT
Blueprint mapped out
This is what’s it all about
Buffing down
Cop a sweet
Out in Singapore
Pinacolada with umbrella straws I’m telling y’all
This is BK nigga
Big clip in broad day nigga
BK, wave it up

[Hook: Tools]
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
Brought the touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hopping on boats
Going to throw it up
Then nigga let’s toast
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
Brought the touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hopping on boats
Even when I’m gone
Know my heart’s still close

[Verse 2: Nu Jerzey Devil]
Hop the hood
Now walk it through that white sand
With some Latin women
Who any watching them belly dance
I got a belly ache
I’m eating too fast
I can’t slow down
They force feeding me the cash
I got a big appetite so I chow down
Pocket full of hundreds
Fuck it I’m a boss now
I make boss moves
Bitch I’m overseas
Fucking on four bitches
Blowing foreign trees
Amsterdam, maybe Oslo, Norway
I’d do me
I give a damn what a whore’s say
True PP stripes like Jorge
Yankees fitted on
Blinds through the doorway
Ha, yea I’m back on that gulley shit
Number one hustler to get money with
Am Jersey Devil
Yea you heard me
But you giving up the trust
I gained it early
Exit out this fake shit
No thrills
Get back to reality
Travelling through the hills
Bitch I’m out of here
Deuces, peace
… Adios capisci

[Hook: Tools]
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
Brought the touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hopping on boats
Going to throw it up
Then nigga let’s toast
Nigga I’m gone
Nigga I’m ghost
Brought the touchdown on a whole another coast
Jumping off planes
Hopping on boats
Even when I’m gone
Know my heart’s still close
