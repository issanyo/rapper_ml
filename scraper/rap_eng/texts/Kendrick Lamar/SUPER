What would my name be? It gotta be something slick, man. It gotta be something, something real slick. "Hardbody." There's really no uniform. That's the catch. It’s whatever the environment he’s in, he chameleons into that environment. No mask, no nothing. You don't see him coming. The powers that he project is straight love. Energy. This right here controls how everybody move and how everybody thinking. You live in a world full of hate. You feel me? The homies right here hating on you, they finna rob you. They finna do this, boom, he gon' come in there. Chameleon. And you think he with you and your crew, but he working on the act of love. Y'all powered up and dap out and move out to the next spot. You going to a spot full of discrimination. He blending in there too. You know? He might got a suit on. You feel me? But he acting on the work of love. And what that does is, his energy builds up to the next man and builds up all the way around the world and everybody is just full of this superb energy. Everybody getting money. Happy. Living and enjoying their lives. And not hating on the next man. That's what he do. He might pull up in a Pinto, you feel? Or a two-door Honda or something like that. You know? Or if he in a prestige spot he might pull up in a Beamer, whatever the case is. His whole thing is about reality of it, you know, and not putting the cape on. You know? Cause he something different than a superhero. The archenemy villain, that's easy. I don't know if I wanna say a woman or a man, but I name her Lucy. Matter of fact, we gon' put it to a stone, we gon' disguise Lucy as a woman. In actuality it's Lucifer, it's a man though. She's seductive, she seduces everybody. She comes into a room and walk out. You think you feeling the love, but once you walk out it's nothing but negative tension around. You feel me? (I wanna see this movie, man) Yeah, "Hardbody." Yeah, we gon' do that. (That's crazy)
