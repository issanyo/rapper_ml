[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it
I don't know if I can stop myself
And you're gonna pay for it
Oh, you'll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it

[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
It's a heavy load, I stroll on a bumpy road
No jacket when I was cold, becomin' one with my soul
Stand toe to toe with my foes, these wolves in sheep clothes
No weapon on me shall prosper, nigga, you better watch it
You playin' with fire, burnin' you slow, hold up
I hear the whispers wishin', it's all cheap voodoo
I keep it cool to keep from goin' coo-coo
With a cal', aimin' at fake smiles and turn them upside down
Came too far for my feet to fail me
Lord, if I'm wrong you can help me now, hold up
Wait a minute, what am I sayin'?
The Devil, he busy, tryna get me everyday in every way
I won't let up, I won't shut up
You can't stop me, you won't knock me, ten-four, now copy
Live almighty, my declaration been written
In hieroglyphics on top of the highest mountain, now listen

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it
I don't know if I can stop myself
And you're gonna pay for it

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
I tell 'em all to hail King Kendrick, resurrectin' my vengeance
Been dissectin' your motormouth, 'til I break down the engine
This ain't no warnin' shot, this a relevant henchman
See my opponent, then â€” cease your existence
Endin' our friendship, baby, I'd rather die alone
Your diaphragm is dietary, what you eatin' on?
Capture your audience with these words, boy
The holy Chapel, the tabernacle, the book of Matthew
And Jesus starin' at you, take your turn, boy
See? It's gon' take a whole lot of y'all to kill me
See? It's gon' take a whole tribe of y'all to kill me, I never die
My pedigree apparently only to idolize
Ahead of me is only my future and idle time
Longevity, I gotta get used to makin' you mine
You tellin' me I only get used to livin' if fine
You can never live in my shoes, permanently paid from God

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar]
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive
When the sun goes down, I scream loud, I'll sleep when I die
But I will never die, my legacy is alive

[Verse 3: Jay Rock]
I gotta get it off my chest, push words just like weight
I got to eat 'til it shows on my face
Tragedy turned to triumph, I'm tryin' just to relate
Jumpin' off of them towers, I'm takin' that leap of faith
Playin' at high stakes
Now when I speak, their pupils'll dilate
Their speakers'll vibrate
Know you feelin' the vibe, that vine couldn't relate
This next clip is long, a son of a gun, big numbers
Do the math, now cover the sum
I come from the slums, we come for the funds
Like run it, under the sun where niggas livin' their life blunted
Countin' the ones, but truthfully nothin' like hundreds
Keep it one hundred
Roadblock in front of me, Look, I'm runnin' through it
Stick and move it, sippin' that Hennessy
This my gutter fluid, nothin' to it
What we lost, we gon' make it back
Like it wasn't missin', now listen, you 'bout to pay for that

[Hook: Chantal Kreviazuk]
Oh, you'll never learn
I touch fire, little burn
This ain't no game, I'm takin' all you have
And you're gonna pay for it
