Hey homeboy, what you know bout them local house parties?
Posted right next to the hennessy
We do the same old dance over here
We like..

[Hook]

Poke ya elbows out and swang like this
Poke ya elbows out and swang like this

[Verse 1]

Hold up homie, you ain't known around here to roll up homie
Might get your face swollen up homie
Don't, run up run up you know I got the kodak on me
I load up like U-Haul trucks, YUP
Don't get your whole crew stuck
In a position that they can't get out
We lay em out like Ricky on that plastic couch
And Q can save you, know of the scholarship they gave you, OUCH
Don't you know we ain't going for the okie doke
West Coast New Edition, Biv Devoe
Baby bib around your neck niggas, I feed you with the better flow
Hit the flo' when we shootin, ruin house parties
There's too many black bodies in one place equals a fuck up
Somehow some way, its fucked up ain't it
But we ain't lookin for the drama today
We tucked the hammers in the hoodies to come and put him away
Now everbody

[Hook]

Poke ya elbows out and swang like this
Poke ya elbows out and swang like this
Poke ya elbows out and swang like this
Poke ya elbows out and swang like this
Whatever you wanna call it
For the weed heads and for the alcoholics
Now this could be some OG lowrider music
Or you can twist your fingers up and gang bang to it

[Verse 2]

I got some ese homies that so loco
They be off that wet
They be hanging out thugging, they be banging sets
They be hanging out, sagging everywhere Im at
I ain't gon lie about it
Got your car at the light, we gon crowd around it
Think you a baller huh?
Think you a flosser huh?
Well you should know that the chain gotta come off ya huh
Before they put it to ya brain gotta off ya huh
He got it for ya, what you want?
Weed, wet, white, E pills, syrup
Where the chronic at? Let it burn up
Let it burn till the Lord come
Let the Monic spokes turn till they can't turn no mo'
Till the neighborhood watch ain't concerned no mo'
I let the neighborhood watch when I open the trunk
A car show is what they got and everybody go

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

What you know about that California lifestyle?
[Problem seeds spitting on the ground follow me?]
Im giving you a walkthrough of the block and down the street
Los Angeles scan less, police Cutlass and Caprice
And problems with scrapers underneath
Lollipops and bad bitches runnin in flocks soon as the car stop
As soon as the beat drop
When it come back on I bet the whole city rock
Word to Jay Rock
I told you that Im focused mane
I do my dance I know that you notice mane
And I rep, I rep like Im supposed to mane
Top Dawg ENT, we some soldiers mane
And the coldest thang about it, no swag right now I do it without it
Now let me put it on
You should move this way soon as she hear the song
Don't wanna see no elbows straight
Everybody just

[Hook]
