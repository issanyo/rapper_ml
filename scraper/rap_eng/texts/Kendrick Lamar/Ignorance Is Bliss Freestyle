Kendrick Lamar: Cause ignorance is bliss
Sigidy: It's nearly sad as toddler as he wonders home
He shooting baskets he wondering if his father's home
But realizing his father's shot in the collar bone, they snapped it like a toddler bone and now he's in a foster home
His anger turns to loneliness until he's mad again
Scout looking through the scraps for a weapon to shoot it back at them
Visions of sadness he pointing it and imagining bullets travel like javelins and stabbed em in the abdomen
He went from this passive child to a massive style black a wild child on the block smoking black and milds
Living in sadness is madness if you can crack a smile
A once proud and happy child is just sadden now
The kid grows up chillin' playing madden now
Bout to have a child of his own and this niggas rappin' now
Rappin and packing the strap instead of em backin' down, clappin' down clowns round town for the cabbage now
Smack the ass on the spouse hittin the black and mild
