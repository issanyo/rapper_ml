[Verse 1]
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with the headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely had patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
Went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came, checks didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the fifth amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I could shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

[Hook]
But why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down

[Verse 2]
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a black woman wishin'
She sayin' this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, hoping you could make it
Women don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
Can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

[Hook]
But why I'm so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
They say I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and tell them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down to the top

[Bridge]
I love god, I love speed, I love drank, I love me
I love oceans in the deep
I love women, I love me
I love God
But I’m scared of god speed
Sometimes

[Verse 3]
Wrote this song looking at a broke home maybe
You know the poverty stricken the little broke boy and baby
Somebody say "Kendrick American they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye
He said homie you messed up
You breaking my good luck
You wishing for miracles
Living through shit, you’re crying hysterical
Settle for everything, complain about everything
Say your soul crack, my world amphetamines
You projects ain’t it, I live in the hood
You living to keep warm
I’m living to pay rent
I paid my way through
Praying to Allah
You played your way through dealing with Wi-Fi
Bull shit yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing go for the ones you came with
We all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
Your pain ain’t mine half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t nothing to me
See I made my moves, with shackled feet

[Interlude]
Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town
Cape Town, Cape Town, Cape Town

[Verse 4]
Corn row Kenny
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr
I wanna get the mixed dashboards triple digits, skrr, skrr
Corn row Kenny
So many plays on me I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I react
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure play with him, you get killed
Play with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb things in my past
Love will give me hope and I won’t relapse
Dave just bought a new nine eleven
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Rashad got his son dripping in gold
Me? I’m ‘bout to let my hair down on hoes
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Top billing that’s a million a show
Might blow the Whole Remy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave got a Grammy this year
Mack wop, but he do what he want

[Outro]
Level two, level two
No I’m not done
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
I could put a rapper on life support
Guarantee something that none of you want
Then hold me down and they yell something like
Rent is like twenty five hundred a month
What if I empty my bank out and skrrrt?
What if I empty my bank out and skrrt?
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t gotta tell me that I’m the one
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
Tell me that, tell me that
That, I am the One
You ain’t got, you ain’t got
You ain’t got
You ain’t got tell me that, what I’m the one
Yes, I’m the one
