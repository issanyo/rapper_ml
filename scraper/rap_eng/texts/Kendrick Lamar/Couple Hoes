[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I've spit that wonder rhymin' shit since thirteen
Uh, motherfucker, I been rhymin' it, it's timin', kid
That's all it's 'bout in this life
If you want to jump in this game, then think twice
Curly-haired nigga, nappy-head flows
Remember eighth grade, I started gettin' all my hoes
Started rockin' all these shows, jumpin' on stages
Readin' in rap books, flipped so many pages
Flipped so many stages in my life
I must admit, I've always been the shit
With the written or the freestyle, a nigga been wild
Get free shoes for my nigga Q now
[Inaudible] or jump shot, all type of Jordan
He say, 'Wait, get anythin' that's important'
Exclusive shit, not the shit Wade be rockin'
You know, [inaudible] said he used the word 'stocking'
Cat with them big-ass jerseys and fake Js
[Inaudible], you ain't fuckin' with these

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar]
Some shit in the barber shop
(Uh, nah, like, I ain't been to the barber shop, nigga
Who's takin' my shit to the barber shop?)
Nigga, I'll gets you owned now
I guess everybody know your songs now
(Now, now I can give you free shoes)
Shoes, uh-huh, uh (I can give you free shoes)
Yo, you gettin' free shoes
How many raps have I wrote?
How many words that I spoke?
How many shit I jot in jail just for others to quote?
That's what my man just brought up
I'm thinkin' 'bout this industry, I'm all caught up
I can't get out, I'm like Charlotte's Web
Lookin' at my shit, can download it on the Web
I'm so confused with these tools
Recycled other dudes
I'm talkin' the greatest, I'm talkin' about legends
I'm talkin' 'bout your rhymes, that shit is half-steppin'
That shit is mad depressin', I'm tryin' to enlighten the city
I'm tryin' to get all the hoes to get with me

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Rap, is it really worth it?
Should I keep doin' it on purpose
Should I jump in the booth? I used to get nervous
But now I'm just the truth like the motherfuckin' Bible
Tabernacle, spin around twice
Shondo, you tell me that I'm nice, yeah

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
[Inaudible] want me to handle this
But I just already sat on it
(Oh, yeah, and I got that for free too
Yeah, Q, what it do?)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, bitch
These niggas teed out here, my nigga
These niggas teed out here, bitch
You niggas teed out here, bitch
You niggas teed out here, bitch
You niggas teed out here

[Verse 5: ScHoolboy Q]
Ain't late for shit no more
I ain't never paid for shit no more
I just walk up in the stall, say, 'Gimme this'
'Aye, gimme that', I ain't got a rack
Yo, I got a sack, we can blow it in the back
Couple hoes gettin' twisted in the 'Lac
Dave got the 'dro, Kendrick got nothin'
Soul got a dime, I'm tryin' to sip another little cup of wine
They ain't get a dime
Sit back, twist up a [inaudible]
Swisher, I give a fuck, never miss you, I'd kiss you
Never cool as the bitch, I'm the shit, give a fuck
Fucked up and I still rip it up

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Yeah, niggas walkin' in with choppers and I don't know
They act like it's a camera
Shootin' everybody on the floor
See, he got the army jeans on
This nigga finna get his beam on
Tryin' to wear a beanie like me

[Verse 6: Kendrick Lamar]
Motherfuckin' plaid motherfuckin' shirts
[Inaudible] at the bottom and shit
Old-ass Jordans and shit
I'd put y'all up on some free motherfuckin' shoes
Now you want to act like your ass got [inaudible]
Big-ass bomber coat like you from New York
Go outside and smoke them cheap-ass Newports
Feelin' like [inaudible] on your ass
