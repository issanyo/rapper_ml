[Part 1: Eminem "Airplanes, Pt. II"]
Let's pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Let's pretend things woulda been no different
Pretend he procrastinated, had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin
They could blow away with the wind, "Marshall, you're never gonna make it
Makes no sense to play the game, there ain't no way that you'll win."
Pretend he just stayed outside all day and played with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasn't time to move and schools weren't changin' again
He wasn't socially awkward and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasn't crazy as shit
And he never dreamed he could rip stadiums and just lazy as shit
Fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch
"You won't amount to shit – quit daydreamin', kid!
You need to get your cranium checked
You're thinking like an alien, it just ain't realistic."
Now pretend they ain't just make him angry with this shit
And there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed at
And his alarm went off to wake him, but he didn't make it
To the Rap Olympics, slept through his plane and he missed it
He's gon' have a hard time explaining to Hailie and Lainey
These food stamps and this WIC shit
‘Cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it
But it didn't fall in his lap, so he ain't even here, he pretends that

[Hook: Chester Bennington "In My Remains"]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Part 2: Kendrick Lamar "Bad Blood (Remix)"]
I can't take it back, look where I'm at
We was OG like D.O.C., remember that?
My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts
Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you
Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more
No, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more
Remember when you tried to write me off?
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you got amnesia
It was my season for battle wounds
Battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumping through
Still, all my life, I got money and power
And you gotta live with the bad blood now

[Hook: Chester Bennington "In My Remains"]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me

[Bridge: Chester Bennington "In My Remains"]
Separate
Sifting through the wreckage, I can't concentrate
Searching for a message in that fear and pain
Broken down and waiting for the chance to feel alive

[Outro: Chester Bennington "In My Remains"]
Now, in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set this silence free
To wash away the worst of me
