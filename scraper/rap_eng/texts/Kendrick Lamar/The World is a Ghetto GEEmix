[Intro]
Kids is what make me feel so good
See you looking at the glory that's coming up into the future of life
See the younger youth is what's gonna make everything to keep going
After I done passed down the hill
Young and black!

[Verse 1: Marcus Eugene]
Uh, young, gifted and I'm black
Uh, young, gifted and I rap
Young and gifted, but I don't got a strap
So I hope nobody try to run up on me with the mac
Like "blat!"
Lay a nigga flat
But let me fall back cause I ain't into all that
As I get back to the trap
When I say I'm trappin', that just mean I'm tryna stack
Tryin' not to get caught up where I'm at
In the 'jects where the mice gettin' cheese with the rats
That's where I be's, and these is the facts
The world is a ghetto, we all know who's Geppetto
Angel on your shoulder, in your ear you got the devil
People change like leaves that them dope boys peddle
Blow trees like flowers in the meadow
Life's a breeze, you know me, I'm just tryin' not to settle
Cause these streets still cold like metal
When it's heat, it ain't sweet
And them shots ain't Jell-O
So, props to them niggas takin' shots like Melo
From the block, just tryna meet the top like "hello!"
Uh, then we sayin' our good-byes
Glory for the villains, no love for the good guys
A system of bad people that's tellin' us good lies
That's life as you know it, you lookin' through hood eyes

[Hook: BJ the Chicago Kid]
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

[Interlude]
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all

[Verse 2: Starks]
From a ghetto where fathers don't even father
Mothers don't even bother
'Less it's about a lotto
Do anything for a dollar
Yeah, they givin' head just to get ahead
Provin' they ain't thinkin' 'bout tomorrow
They bottle full of sorrow
Pain is deeper than cargo pockets
I wouldn't knock it, I just want better for my note
Yeah, I know we all different
But we'll always be the same 'til we change our endin'
Man, we gotta change our mind before we change our livin'
And if we never change our mind we in the same position
But niggas is niggas
And bitches, well, they still bitches
Instead of brothers and sisters
Man, this shit is ridiculous
I guess I'm still ridiculous
Hollerin' at shorty like "hey, yo, let me get yo' digits"
Then a man get offended
Then a pistol get grippin'
And he shoot and he missin'
He don't care who he hittin'
Another senseless victim
All from ghetto livin'

[Hook]
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

[Interlude]
Dude, we got to get our minds together!
Anytime a brother was shot another brother in his own neighborhood
Then go to his funeral and turn over his own casket
They need to have the police down there
Cause see the niggas is N.A.A.C.P
Niggas ain't actin' like colored people
If I can't work and make it, I steal and take it
They come up to me with a nigga who can put air in a bottle and sell it
He can do it man
A nigga can sell anything

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
As I watch the sky change colors
The rain flooded the neighborhoods of the black brothers
The black mothers are stressing, the coroners have covered
Another statistic, episodes of a cold summer
The street runners got the same legs of Michael Johnson
The fast life surpassed life beyond the conscience
Profanity in the air, the children use the content
The vanity's in the air, that Louis bag: haunted
The black girl with the hair, that's kind of coarse
Her baby daddy's in court, she smoking on a Newport
Seventeen with dreams of becoming a stripper
Or becoming an AIDS victim while touching them zippers
The life that we living in, things we would do just to live again
How can an angel forever live in sin?

[Hook]
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto
Don't you know
That it's true
That for me
And for you
The world is a ghetto

[Outro]
You know, anybody that uses somebody else to gain is pimpin'
Well, I tell you what soul brother, lookie here
Can't nobody pimp you but your pimp ass self
You understand?
Then there's a lot of funky things in this country
And there's a lot of good things too
But there's more funky than good
Shit ain't gettin' better
We've changed some for the best
Awful lot of cases for the worst
And some, they have not changed at all
