[Verse 1: Lecrae & (Natalie Lauren)]
Uhh! I know it's gon' kill me but I just can't let it go
And the, taste so appealing's got a grip upon my soul
These, honey dip lies mesmerize me
Pride's got its crooked fingers twisted all inside in me
Fools walk the path I'm on, never to be seen again
Sippin on seduction while we eatin' on some secret sin
(No one will never know) says the whisper in my ear
And I know I should be over this but I ain't seein' clear

[Hook: Natalie Lauren]
Baby this is innocent (killa)
It won't even hurt a little bit (killa)
I'm only here for your benefit (killa)
I'm your every wish (killa)
Come on and let me in (killa)
Baby this is innocent (killa)
And it won't even hurt a little bit (killa)
Close your eyes and let's get lost tonight (killa)
It'll be alright (killa)
You'll see I'm not a (killa)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Her feet go down to DEATH, so don't let her consume you
Even though her heart is black, her exterior's beautiful
She'll take yo' life away, and strip away yo' joy
Pretends that she gon' build you up but she just gon' destroy you
Evil looks so lovely covered in her lace of lies
And the silky smooth seduction just manipulates my mind
Her fabrical fabrication is fuelin' my fascination
While I'm intoxicated she starts her assassination
I'm losin all my honor and my years to the merciless
Givin all my life away but I'm just so immersed in this (killa)
Take my breath away
I hope I wake up before they start my wake up
Somebody make me break up, I'm datin a (killa)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Lecrae]
My friends fell low, when they was so high
Got me runnin' scared of myself, no lie
And I know I'm gon' die, I tried cold turkey
But when I'm feelin' worthy, Satan's sure tryin' to merk me
I'm doin' myself dirty, flirtin' with what's perverted
I should follow the word but I guess I'd rather be murdered
{*ahem*} Excuse me I mean martyred, cause I'm killin' myself
My sin conceived a baby, and we gon' name her Death
Breath {*gasps*} taken, she take my breath away
Replaces it with poison, and I'm so swept away
I need some prayer today, hope I wake up before they start my wake up
Somebody make me break up, I'm datin' a (killa)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Pour up (Drank), head shot (Drank)
Sit down (Drank), stand up (Drank)
Pass out (Drank), wake up (Drank)
Faded (Drank), faded (Drank)

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar]
Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
Pool full of liquor, I'mma dive in it

[Verse 4: Kendrick Lamar]
All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
And I got hunger pain that grow insane
Tell me do that sound familiar?
If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
I probably sleep and never ever wake up
Never ever wake up, never ever wake up
In God I trust but just when I thought I had enough
