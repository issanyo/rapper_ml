[Verse 1: Jay Rock]
Damn girl looking good in your baby phat
You got an ass a skinny nigga could handle that
Look I ain't T-Pain I don't love strippers
I might buy em a drank if that ass thicker
Look I’m a hustler I like to get the cash quicker
And I don’t settle for less I’m not no ass kisser
I’m the ladies man bring your lady friends
I’mma bring my niggas and we can get it in
She like to pop pills, I like to pop steel
And leave a bitch ass nigga with a doctor bill
You fully load ma you don’t need Dr. Phil
I got this Mary Jane shit ease your mind forreal
Lets take a trip to my apartment
Take a lil shot of patron get it started
You fuckin’ with a gangster tonight so say goodbye to the waynester type
You with the Rock

[Kendrick Lamar]
Let me tell y’all something
I seen this bitch right she fine than a motherfucker I ain’t gone lie straight up
I take her home though, fucked and got off, pitbull type

[Kendrick Lamar]
Now do I love them hoes, hell no
Take her to the swap meet before Melrose
Benihana, more like like Top Ramen noodles
Champagne no sweet Kool-Aid made by Sherane
Send her back to her boyfriend with cum stains
I redesign bitches wardrobe
All I do is make up something then sit it between her earlobes
She thinking no one ever invented clothes
Used to hide the camera in the closet
Now I’m like I’m doing you a favor to fuck you bitch pose
They don’t even want to go to award shows
They just wanna award me with hoes
Put em on a track like vocals
Leave em for a day and they want their master back like the first album by Jay
I dash with the dividends no shit if Big Pimpin is a sin then I rather not repent (preach)

[Outro]
Girl on the phone
You know I need my master back like Jay Z first album
Okay I got this one girl her name is tity pop her name is what?
Her name is tiny pop I met her at USC she’s a good girl
