[Intro: JaVonté]
In time you'll learn this is about you
In time you'll learn this is about you
In time you'll learn this is about you

[Verse: Kendrick Lamar]
Babies from 80's don't know—know no better
Don't nothing go better with ignorance
But the belligerent kids that we living with
Some of them masculine, some of them feminine
'member the universe used to be innocent
Now they just look at us crazy like immigrants
Everyday that I wake up, I'mma sin again
I'm not a citizen, I'm just a nigga from Section.80

[Outro]
Show of hands, how many been taking notes? Good. Leave everything on the table now. Vulnerability, this is your generation. Show, show your pain
