[Verse 1: Ciel Viole]
I don’t have time to die, clinging to these streets
All the lines that I've cut, all the smiles I've emptied
This is perfect, this is perfect
Her memories of me will fade with distance
All I care about is myself
I dreamed off DMT, fucked you lucidly
Can’t hear anybody else
Too many spilled drinks, precision’s gone extinct, oh no
You always fuck to forgive, but never ever give a fuck girl
I bet you love me for this night even if it’s ‘bout the pressure

[Hook: Ciel Viole]
Please, pain is all I need
I’m at your mercy, I'm at your mercy
Please, I said it's all I need
The paper birds
The paper birds
I'm at your mercy

[Verse 2: Ciel Viole]
Watch me falter, make you weak
Doesn’t need much questions, no
I knew you longer than we lived
To give a fuck about the pressure, oh no
I made a contract to help my sins
Without an apology yes
I haven’t fell on my face in so damn long
Can’t change our problems with words alone

[Hook: Ciel Viole]
Please, pain is all I need
I’m at your mercy, I'm at your mercy
Please, I said it's all I need
The paper birds
The paper birds
The paper birds
The paper birds
I'm at your mercy
The paper birds
The paper birds

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Let’s talk about the street fightin'
We liked it and never lost it
That's gun riots, drive by it with no stalkin'
That shit talkin', pissed off cause we piss poor
Mob pulls bleed see years of war
What you livin for? A couple stolen cars
White T’s, Jordan 4's, ratchet hoodrat broads
A human stash box before they start that martial law
Fuck planet Earth, we killed that turf, they want Mars
Pussy, was fat as mother love
Giving birth to Precious, hell yea I wanna fuck
She took my pacifier and tried to throw up them digits
Opened up my mouth to say she replaced them with sherm stick uh uh
She said you must be wet behind the ears, uh huh
I said I'm blessed my mama wasn’t here
Then we started vibin' and writin' melodies to the sirens
Gun smoke in the air, we stared at the horizon
Hypnotizin', and murder was the case
And every time she wake up, she’s at another wake
Her name is Compton and she need a place to stay
And said if she can live in my heart, she'd play my soul safe
Amen
