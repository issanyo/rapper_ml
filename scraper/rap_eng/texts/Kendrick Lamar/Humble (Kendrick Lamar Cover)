[INTRO]
NOBODY PRAY FOR ME
IT'S BEEN THAT DAY FOR ME
WAAAAAY (YEAH, YEAH!)

[#1]
MERDE
I REMEMBER SYRUP SANDWICHES AND CRIME ALLOWANCES
FINESSE A NIGGA WITH SOME COUNTERFEITS
BUT NOW I’M COUNTIN' THIS
PARMESAN WHERE MY ACCOUNTANT LIVES
IN FACT, I'M DOWNIN’ THIS
D'USSÉ WITH MY BOO BAE TASTE LIKE KOOL-AID FOR THE ANALYSTS
GIRL  I CAN BUY YO' ASS THE WORLD WITH MY PAYSTUB
OOH, THAT PUSSY GOOD, WON'T YOU SIT IT ON MY TASTE BLOODS?
I GET WAY TOO PETTY ONCE YOU LET ME DO THE EXTRAS
PULL UP ON YOUR BLOCK, THEN BREAK IT DOWN: WE PLAYIN' TETRIS
A.M. TO THE P.M., P.M. TO THE A.M., FUNK
PISS OUT YOUR PER DIEM/ YOU JUST GOTTA HATE 'EM, FUNK
IF I QUIT TA BM, I STILL RIDE MERCEDES, FUNK
IF I QUIT THIS SEASON, I STILL BE THE GREATEST, FUNK
MY LEFT STROKE JUST WENT VIRAL
RIGHT STROKE PUT LIL' BABY IN A SPIRAL
SOPRANO C WE LIKE TO KEEP IT ON A HIGH NOTE
IT'S LEVELS TO IT YOU AND I KNOW

BITCH, BE HUMBLE
SIT DOWN BITCH, BE HUMBLE

[#2]
WHO DAT FADA THINKIN' THAT HE FRONTIN'-ON MANMAN? (MAN-MAN)
GET THE FUCK OFF MY STAGE, I'M THE SANDMAN (SANDMAN)
GET THE FUCK OFF MY DICK, THAT AIN'T RIGHT
I-MAKE A PLAY FUCKING UP YOUR WHOLE LIFE
I AM SO- FUCKIN' SICK AND TIRED OF THE PHOTOSHOP
SHOW ME SOMETHIN' NATURAL
LIKE AFRO ON- RICHARD PRYOR
SHOW ME SOMETHIN' NATURAL LIKE ASS
WITH SOME STRETCH MARKS
STILL ´LL TAKE YOU DOWN
RIGHT ON YOUR MAMA'S COUCH IN POLO SOCKS
HUH

YOU DO NOT AMAZE ME
HUH
I BLEW COOL FROM AC
OBAMA JUST PAGED ME

I DON'T FABRICATE IT
HUH
MOST OF Y'ALL BE FAKIN'
HUH

WATCH MY SOUL SPEAK YOU-LET THE MEDS TALK, AYY
IF I KILL A FADA, IT WON'T BE THE ALCOHOL, AYY
I'M THE REALEST FADA AFTER ALL

BITCH, BE HUMBLE
