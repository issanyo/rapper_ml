[Intro: Jay Rock]
Let's start our program ladies and gentlemen
LET'S GO!
NYC baby, haha we here now haha
Let's get it in

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
Watch her getting jumping like third grade barrettes
Let the beretta blow you die slow while I smoke on chron-ic
Try to throw salt homie like dry sweat gun powder flow through triceps
I'm more advanced got a corvette flow, I spit like Murcielago
Through precipitation I give rappers a sun tan
Rapping like a promotional van when I pull the drum out
Clap more than a Beatle fan, never heard a sound like THIS
I'm number one, you're forever number two like Siamese
This is New York rap on gold d's
Jay Rock proceed

[Verse 2: Jay Rock]
Get it in like IVs
My flow is not on radar, the K-9 D
Play y'all like chess, you can't check us, come correct
Or face a lyrical bomb threat
I bomb first like Makaveli in 9 6
The nine mili have you on your death bed sick
See really I'm a project baby
Niggas are going Barney [?] raised me
Crooked cops
Stop sign got a bullet whole, don't stop
Speed through it like a drag race, or get buried under the state
K.Dot

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Expose niggas for who they are
Under their white T might be halter tops
Rap fags, the black mag come with a complimentary black mask
Black Jason, red beam on the Glock
Money talks, I'm trying to have a life long conversation
Live like a silver spoon caucasian with a chain of hotel rooms across the nation
No home training, break 1,000,000 dollar vases
Here we go yo, here we go yo
I got the special kind of flow they call it Hip-Hop antidote
Murder MC's, if you're a rapper please check your pulse
(Hurry Up) too late
(Flat line) John Doe

[Verse 4: Jay Rock]
Dead than a motherfucker, Damn I'm a motherfucker
(BLUCKA BL-BLUCKA BLUCKA BL-BLUCKA)
Let his Momma suffer
I ball like the West Coast at Harlem Rucker
But at venice beach, jump shots I'm finna see
Fuck a drop top, that's how they killed Kennedy
I'm in a bronco, OJ in the city streets
With my AC on (With your AC on?)
Shit don't try to play me homes
Jump stupid, then ask to get filet mignon
I'ma break him in half (and I'ma dumbthe bones)
Spill out (Then light the blunt)
With the butt of the comb
I got a lock like riper
25 to lifers, walk in the yard and never fold in a riot
You know who we are, Top Dawg generals
I thank God for rap, my career was being a criminal
BLISS

[Verse 5: Kendrick Lamar]
New level Hip Hop
Where my shovel? Let me convince Nas
Dig a couple graves tell 'em that the new rap zombie is alive to invade
On the masses south central true best I
40 Glock stashes, buck 50 score left eye
Going back to Cali in a New York state of mind

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I can't wait
You know, nigga ain't never hopped on no, no subway train you know
Might catch the blue line or something
Metro Bus
125 St. down Rosecrans, 53 down central
Hahahaha, It's all new to us you know
Get out the hood for once
Statue of Liberty, I wanna see the fire on that motherfucker
The fire really burn in that motherfucker?
Heh, you see a nigga don't a nigga don't ever know and shit
I ain't never seen snow nigga
Southern California
Crenshaw, gangbanging can't slang it
I wanna see some NY fitteds
Get used to them L.A. cats, heh
Puerto Rican mamis, nigga don't got no puerto rican mamis, nigga we got Mexicans nigga
Straight up, haha
