Shout out my main fucking dude Kool kid
From Metchern, New Jersey
Shout out
This beat is buzzy as fuck but i don't give a shit

Bass amusing mind waves time age and paradise
The air is nice. I blare and write to the music
Sipping a mystic she got the Derrick Rose lipstick
I hear nothing  but crickets When you kick it what I spit is ballistic
Hitting the spliff stick like a Jarvis green right hook
From queens to red hook, I'm with Vince the price on the white look
I hit a zurg just to get a buzz, graffiti artist type markers
Agrestic the best hits from Mary Louise Parker
Peter, ms Parker she got a fat one
Been writing rhymes ever since capital punishment when platinum
To many styles like Justin I'm on Crenshaw with the TRUTH
I'm garret with the breeze, the air we on is type loose
All of a Sutton you get Nathan, shout out triz Nathanial
Trenta Ochoa that's Daniel chillin with my cocker spaniels
My DJ is divine, after kq Got the words nailed
I take the R TRAIN, hit up the third rail
My souls melodic, you get zero, I'm a blazer
You rhymes are figgy like diggy but you ain't fucking with Mr. Fraser
History knows what's up, niquan knows what's up
Pray to the lord save my life, Luis Lebron knows what's up
Yea you on but you suck my people's make the real shit
When you hear you fear it, you most defiantly can feel it
I'm in the hall like Courtney, support me and my dudes
Shouts to teddy from the BX, let her suck it like DX
I got J like Ms Lynn and Mr Emz
Young talent on the map man where do I begin
Roll call over! but after my man stash the burner
I make her like Lawrence because i turn her
Now we hit the swishes with you sister
Wrapping these bitches like Japanese fishes

Her voice is specatcaular, the words from vernacular are beautiful like her face
Despite her race i would like a place to interact with her, just to excite her grace
Her eyes in my mind i could never erase, her hair color, her smile with the perfect laugh
God made Goddesses for a reason, and hes really, really, wonderful at his craft
A wondrous creature, makes me want to feature her features and reach her
See her be a preacher with words of wisdom, can i keep her?
Can she hear my voice through the speaker? she looks like a queen from the top of her head to her sneaker
Leaves me speechless, i feel weak in her vicinity
Let me pause at a chance to tell you how cool i really think she is

How happy i am with this lady, the heartbeat i have underneath my chest is crazy
And it take me to places, where i never been before
Its not love just making sure, its not love just making sure!
What do all these girls take me for, what are they faking for?
Other females are trife and reckless, 6 months for a diamond necklace
Left me heartbroke, check the exit, its best i rest 'fore i wreck shit
But back to you, your attitude is pretty like the clouds in the sky
I don't know why i stare, maybe i'm in awe because your there
And its so fair that your so real
I forget that i lost a bet on this subject, at the end of the day its just how i feel
Your flowers for my day. just letting you know
I'm never letting you go
