[Intro]
Praise to the almighty, HiiiPower
Me and my niggas
3 eyes to my alumni
I wanna hear, turn me up
Turn me up a little bit more
My nigga Cole in this motherfucker, sup nigga
There we go yeah, turn me up

[Verse 1]
Picture plenty pussies throwing pelly guns at me
Paranoia making it more than difficult for me to sleep
Pinnacle, I know I be, centerfold, I know I got
But they hate to frame me as the Mona Lisa of hip hop
So retaliation is a must
When we bend the block, my niggas dumping out the roof
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Me, K-D-O-T, put TNT inside my suit
Walk inside the label, struck a match, then I blew
C4 everywhere, C4 everywhere
I got three hoes with me, it smells like Dior and derrière
Decoy Dodge slow, you can detour to Heaven’s stair
Walking inside Hell’s dungeons, I just might derail something
They pussies, I smell something
You dush on the daily niggas, you push on them daisies
I push on gas on the Mercedes, nigga
Came in this game with a Rolie chain and a dream
Became reality, made some casualties, my choppers scream

[Hook]
And now we dumping out the roof
Drive past, guns blast, shooting up the charts too
Me, K-D-O-T, put T-N-T inside my suit
Walk inside the label, struck a match, then I blew

[Verse 2]
Nigga that thought Good Kid might flop, or that I might go pop
Or your bitch won’t drop, knees when my shit drop
You’re too infatuated by the fucking numbers
Should make it easy for me to divide and conquer
I come from Compton, we ain’t have it all
Smoke a space inside the cafeteria hall
And I’m putting fear in you all
See your skeletons shaking
Jump out your body, you Ricky Bobby unti you naked
Y’all pray to God this week I be putting out bombs
I pray to God this beat is good enough for Shyne
If not J.Cole, your shit is trash
But at least my opinion just made everyone laugh
This is where we at? I guess it’s entertainment
I guess this is speculation making a classic king with
If I ain’t have the patience I’d probably self destruct
Real people want real music, the jig is up

[Bridge: Kendrick Lamar & J Cole]
Your worst fear is confirred, we love that you crashed and burn the real is back
KDOT it’s your turn, take your victory lap
King Cole salutin’ Compton’s own King Kendrick
That's the sky is falling, the wind is calling
Stand for something or die in the morning
The city hail King Kendrick Lamar
The world hail King Kendrick Lamar

[Hook]
[Outro]
This is my life and I look at it like it's my last
And I’m lookin’ right past the future as I reminisce on my past
And I don’t even think how I used to, my mind is on rocket blast
And I don’t even drink like I used too, and I don’t even smoke
So you know this natural flow is for users since they want to go to rehab
Lookin’ at the coke that he had, matter fact that followers bother them
Then but I won’t say my bad, see I just lay in the cut
Watch the product stack up, motherfucker what what
See now we dumpin’ out the roof
