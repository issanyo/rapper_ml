[Verse 1: Javonte (Kendrick Lamar)]
Sitting here thinking about how to get my money up today
Cause my change is looking a little strange
Maybe I should just go and rob a bank
(But I need money for the guns)
And my shoes kinda old so I can't be on the run
Need to climb up on a cool million
Cause a 9 to 5 just ain't an option

[Hook]
I need a get rich quick scheme
I need a get rich quick scheme
I'm trying to live the American Dream
But the odds are against me
I need a get rich quick scheme
I need a get rich quick scheme
I'm trying to live the American Dream
(Yeah I want it all)
But the odds are against me
(Trying to take over the world)

[Verse 2]
Empty envelopes deposited to the safe
Withdrawn as much as I could take
30 days late car no pass too
I'll park it somewhere else if it's what I gotta do
(And I got bills, bills, bills, bills, bills I can't afford)
1-800 numbers on my caller ID
Won't get a call 'til I hit the lottery

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
I'm tired of living pity broke
As I promise all the levies that was in in o (?)
I hit the bank to withdraw the tellers tell me in o'
I wanna have commas and live with common rich folk
You know the Oprahs and the Russells
With the hustle that can put me number six on the Forbes list
Ignore my troubles with a duffel [?]
Rick James screaming out, "I'm rich bitch"
But for now I'm just an average Joe
Drinking Kool Aid, boiling water, noodles on the kitchen stove
Gotta use them jumper cables just so my car can't get cut off
Every morning this is boring, you was touring, I was doing
Bad like Michael in the 80's with the curl [?]
Wishing I was balling out
Zipper open showing groins
Eating lobster looking proper [?] helicopter
But for now I gotta rob ya

[Hook]
