[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
I fucked up the rap game and you ain't even know it
I just fucked what's her name and you ain't even know it
She got a *censored* tattoo and you ain't even know it
We about to form a little groupie and you ain't even know it, let's get it
Stuck in a rock and a hard place
Eminem, Pac and where God stay
Timberlands pop that jaw bone
Now bitch nigga, tell me how that tar taste
And even Tarzan can get swung on
I never hung out with the loud mouth
You got a foul mouth
And that dead body gon' smell foul when it fouls out
She filed my nails in the Bahamas
We found ourselves in the Bahamas
She found God, meditation and peace
I found myself without a condom
You know everybody having them babies
It's a beautiful thing it ain't crazy
If a rapper monogamous, you know what the problem is?
Too many bitches got rabies
And I hate a ho-hoppin' woman
Stank pussy-poppin' woman
You fuckin' fool don't know about you
But my dick need 70 years on it
Anything after that is just a bonus
And I been in the lab with my opponents
And since Sway done swayed that list
He got a flatscreen the next morning
Tell 'em I need my credit when it's due
Tell 'em I need my lettuce when it's new
Tell 'em I got a fetish for fine fabric
Franklins and saying, "Fuck you"
Tell 'em it's TDE 'til I'm DDT'd in that grave
And Top Dawg is proof
'til my nigga Whoo Kid get free, ain't shit comin' for free
I'm 'bout to rape you niggas 'til you recoup

[Verse 2: Rocko]
Ay that monster truck, sit tall as fuck, it’s so big can’t even tow it Don't like snakes keep my grass cut, so low can't even mow it
Sip Dom Peri', little high glow, no no we don’t do Moet
If it ain't P.J., no Rose from me hostess don’t even pour it
Specks on Tom Ford, button-down Michael Kors
Always on like the refrigerator, I’m plugged in, ho, you know it
A.P. and that Piguet, wear the Breitling when I’m bored
Got a Masterpiece and a 41-millimeter, and you ain’t even know it Keep the .45 in my pocket: ain’t gon' show it 'til I have to pop it
Then you gone know it, damn who shot you, they don’t even know it
Hawks game fuckin' floor it, TV seat front row it
Rocko Da Don CEO it, ain’t gotta rap and you know it

[Chorus: Future]
This a thousand dollar pair of shoes and you don't even know it
This a thousand dollar cup of lean and you don't even know it
This a half a million dollar car, you don't even know it
I came up from bottom, you don't even know it
My niggas all ride with me on, you don't even know it
Got killers with me right now, you don't even know it
This a million dollar watch nigga, you don't even know it
Got a million dollar crib nigga, you don’t even know it

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
We've got a lot of Marijuana
If you see me you got a problem
Run up on me like you want it
Guaranteed we're gonna solve it
They'll be thinkin' someone shot him
Hit him with a bottle
I'mma let a nigga have it
Started from the bottom
Now my diamonds looking autumn
And police don't even caught him
It's a milli if you call him, presidential rollie
It's a ticket if you want it
And I'll show you lil' niggas you can get it if you want it
U-O-E-N-O...
That good weed you don't even blow
See I drank so much Bombay in here tonight, can't even drive
And that head feel so good to me that I can't even lie
See me all up on the curb, you think I'm drunk the way I'm swerving See you ask how much it cost, you niggas got a lot of nerve
So much money
All the motherfuckin' bottles up in here I got nervous
Order more, car service - Phantom Rolls Royce curtains
Roll one more and that's curtains
Young Khalifa, that's curtains
In Taylor Gang we worship

[Verse 4: A$AP Rocky]
Been rich for 'bout a year now, you ain't even know it
Had a long talk with my accountant, I ain't even blow it
The whole game bit my shit, you ain't even know it
A$AP on the remix, you ain't even know it
I say these niggas, need lord - got a crib they can't even afford
In the club lookin' all bored
Show 'em your money, you ain't even throw it
And that crib you don't even own it
That lean, you ain't even pour it
Every bad bitch dream about my dick, you ain't even know it
She poppin' and droppin' it lower
Droppin' it down to the floor
Give you the feeling it's yours, hoping you, score, you ain't even know her
She asked about my journey as she sat upon my lap
I said "I'm fresh up out the slums but I ain't never going back"
You ain't know?

[Verse 5: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I'm flying private through Cloud 9
Yeah, if you got a problem, I'm Einstein
Yeah, I'm yawnin', I'm so tired of ballin'
Yeah, only selling work to them workaholics
Got guns bigger than you nigga, I don't fuck with new niggas
I blues your bitch ass, hope somebody give you rhythm
I got animal all in my floor, take your shoes off at the door
Niggas feed these bitches lies, nigga don't food poison my ho
I buy my drugs for the low, like a coupon on at the store
My niggas like Kanye with that good, my niggas like Lou Rawls with that blow
Niggas be sayin' they racked up, don't let that Q-ball leave you broke
I know you want a pat on the back, but then those fools goin' see you choke
I saw your bitch and she said, she tryin' to move on and let go
Boy, I get up in that pussy and hit her with moves you don't even know
Niggas be trippin' over these hoes, I done came too far to get close I've been outchea gettin' bread and I don't need you all in my loaf
If you stick your neck out there, I'll have my goon's all at your throat Niggas be lukewarm at the most and when I'm through ballin' I coach
Shout out to my nigga Mack gettin' his boo on in that Ghost
I'm still coming off the top of the dome but it'd be on a tombstone if I wrote, Tunechi

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
My kids already rich and they don't even know
These nigga's sayin' they playa's, they ain't even scored
My bitch rolling my weed, she don't even smoke
Everybody following me, I ain't even Moses, nigga

[Verse 6: Lil Wayne]
Uh, my cologne illegal in nine countries
I found a way like it was hiding from me
Yeah, my weed good, my sex better
Bitch, don't text me no long letters
I’m ahead of the game, I need a blowjob
Most of these ho's ain't got no job
And these niggas goin' buy em' everything
You goin' fuck around, and get the ho robbed
I'm ahead of the game, I need a haircut
Used to hug the block, I mean bear hug
And tell them rats the AK go Rat-a-Tat, like snare drums
I woke up this morning, dick rock hard, dick harder than a armadillo MLK would be proud of me, cause I do this shit for all my niggas
Her mouth, pussy, or asshole, life is full of hard decisions
If she ain't fuckin', she get the boot, let me write this bitch a parking ticket
Ain't got time for love life, all I know is get paid
I'm high like Bonjour, twisted like french braids
I got my own shoes, SLIME, T
I feel like MJ I'm working that graveyard shift, man these niggas been dead

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Uh, I feel asleep in that pussy and I didn't even know
I woke up and acted like I didn't even know her, yeah
Don't fuck with these fuck niggas, you already know us
I’m looking for that loud pack, weedman bring the noise
Yeah

[Verse 7: Lil Wayne]
Pass that weed to the next nigga, blunt longer than a tongue twista Hoes want this scud missile, I'mma ball, like Crystal
Lil Tunchi Li, young sex pistol, new money, no wrinkles I
'm hard headed, Ocho, Dedication Cinco, uh

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
What up 5?
Rocko fuck with me! Yeah!
Future fuck with me! Yeah!
T, I feel like MJ
I'm working that graveyard shift, man these niggas been dead
