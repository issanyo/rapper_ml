[Verse 1: Ab-Soul]
I'm starin' at you and you look so good
I want it in the back seat and on top of the hood
And, I would do it all day if I could
Put a lumberjack on and give you the wood
You gotta man and that's understood
But I gotta girlfriend too, this a mutual move
So we do what grown folk do
She had a new lit candle on the table for two
A home cooked meal with the best soul food
I told her "get on my plate, I'll just have you"
You can sit on my face after I say grace
Or I could just beat it up like I knew kung fu
We ended up in the kitchen with a sink full of dishes
Then I sat her on the stove like a pot when I hit it
She never want me to stop when I'm in it
Not even a minute until she finish
Then I don't

[Bridge: Ab-Soul]
She works at the corner store
She is so bad, so bad, so...
I said "my name is Soul
Store me inside you phone
We need some time alone
In our near future, future
Cause I am tryin' to bone
Whenever your man ain't home

[Hook: Ab-Soul]
Take off your pants, baby
And come to me
We done had all this drank
We done smoked all this weed
Take off your pants
Dont be scared of me
I won't hurt you girl
I'll be your therapy

[Verse 2: Ab-Soul]
When I come from out of that pussy
And I smell fresh air
You lost your voice yelling
"Pull my long ass hair!"
Had the 112 Clan
We could do it anywhere
I ask her where she want it next
She started staring at the stairs
So we did it on the stairs
And we took it upstairs
Then we came back down
When she came and she gave me
The crown that I wear, right now
Then I bounce like rubber
Just in case her man come unannounced
Send me a text message saying it was the bomb
I send her a text like "hit me when he gone
So we can continue to creep."
And now I'm in the sheets 3 days out the week
Freaks come out at night
But I'm up in the morning
And she up in the morning
So we gon' fuck in the morning
My only problem is running out of condoms
She say she on the patch, but I can't buy that

[Hook: Ab-Soul]

[Verse 3: Ab-Soul]
Knock on the door
He isn't home
Shes all alone
Her legs so long
Don't ask me whats wrong
Ask me whats right
Cuz I just wanna lay pipe for your info
She do tricks on the dick this is how I know
She make my whole shit disappear down her throat
And this a trip, she don't even choke
And I beat like a heart, she can feel a pulse
Beat, beat, beat, beat....
