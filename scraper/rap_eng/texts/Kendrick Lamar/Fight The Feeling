[Intro: Mac Miller]
Close your eyes...

[Verse 1: Mac Miller & Iman Omari]
So watch her do the Macarena, somewhere out by Pasadena
Love a drug that everybody here just tryna get a taste of
You a waste of the space that you take up
Livin', this time around I'm not kiddin'
I had an intuition about these women
And suspicion got me lookin' at you different
How a man in my position can't start slippin' down these slopes
'Cause it's all just (downhill from there)
As a kid I didn't learn that, but (now I'm aware)
When you a youngin
You just tryna live your life and have some fun
In a world where you have yet to see how evil it's become
It's hard to have a dream when you deep inside of one
And I know you hate them spirits so I keep em in my lungs
I'm a Beatle to these young kids
But sometimes I be feelin' like a needle to these young kids
You had the world, you about to leave it to these young kids
And we gonna show you what the love is...

[Pre-Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
Stay high, go for what you know
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It won't stop!

[Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Uh, and I keep a couple Most Dope homies by me
So there ain't too many times it's me, myself and Irene
We stay smokin' through the night wake up, do some tai-chi
Homie can't you see I'm chillin? Please don't fuck up my chi
Yeah my jacket Y-3, recently been up on fashion
Waste a bunch of money, kinda stinks of sastisfaction
Fell asleep in Hollywood, woke up in Manhattan
Ballin' like I'm Jordan, but I'm fresh as Mars Blackmon
A penny for your thoughts, a dollar for your dreams
A price on an idea, we never can agree
They tell you what to know, but it's better to believe
So why you tryna act like what you never gonna be?
Still I tell em, "Fuck what you know, I'm feelin' comfortable"
Just continue livin' life, cause enough of 'em don't
You spent your days countin' every single penny made
Restart now, cause we comin' for you anyways

[Pre-Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
Stay high, go for what you know
Yeah, Macadelic...
Let it in your mental and don't ever let it go
It ain't never gon' stop cause

[Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
I told you it won't stop cause
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Sometimes I wake up, up in the morning, make up
Wipe the smudge of makeup off my bed
Soon as sheâ€™s gone and take up
Hours out my day just to find power shit to say
But you won't hear it
Even if your ears was pierced with Beats by Dre
I mean the sun is slowly falling, we all surely should die eventually
So what's your calling? Oh you left your phone behind?
Identity crises break mirrors, vices steer us through wickedness
Jesus Christ is right near us and Devil said you owe ten percent
Sold your soul, I know, sold your soul and you're hopeless
My focus, stare at elopin' on boats that float in the open
Of oceans that coast the line on the margins I rhyme, choking
Or soaking up game, I'm hoping you picked the second one
Change the emotion of jealousy that you're holding
You're telling me that you're golden but really cubic zirconia
Let me see, I'll break you down like a pound of fire, whenever
Your tactics are mighty clever but even if you Mayweather, you

[Hook: Iman Omari & Mac Miller]
You can't fight the feeling, feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no (it won't stop!)
You can't fight the feeling
You can't fight the feeling, no
