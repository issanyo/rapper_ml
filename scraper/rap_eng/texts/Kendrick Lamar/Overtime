[Intro: Miguel]
Righteous, righteous
Woo!
Goddamn

[Pre-Hook: Miguel]
Baby let me know it’s mine
And I might put in overtime
Understanding overnight
You know tonight ain't a sober night

[Hook: Miguel & Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah

[Verse 1: ScHoolboy Q]
I wanna fuck right now
In the bedroom geeked, while your clothes hang down
Chillin' all day, lovin' all night
Nice ass, and your stomach all tight
If your money ain’t right, I should be in your life
Put it down when your boyfriend know, girl
Both hands where the sun won’t show, girl
Meet you around four with the chauffeur
Keep a penny on top of my loafers
Keep a diamond on each of my tooth
I’m gettin' money like athletes
It can, it can go down in the backseat
I know all your right spots without asking, hey

[Pre-Hook: Miguel]
Baby let me know it’s mine
And I might put in overtime (that’s right, yeah)
Understanding overnight
You know that I ain’t the sober type

[Hook: Miguel & Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah

[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q]
Girl you bangin, you dynamite
Keep an arch in your back when you do it like
Fuck with me, you be luxury day and night
Got me trickin' on everything overpriced
Can I hit it and skip all the love?
Leave your square and come chill with a thug
Girl I’m privileged, you know how the time be changin'
Know I’m hittin' it right when your core be shakin'
Why you hangin' with niggas that’s missin' payments?
Keepin' my dollars on top of dollars
Netflix and chill when it’s after hours
I should be in your room when you leave the shower
Hittin' them spots like you taught me ‘bout 'em
Girl me and you got a lot in common
I’m the one you should call when you’re done with clubbin’
Darlin' fuck all the talk, let me show you somethin'

[Pre-Hook: Miguel]
Baby let me know it’s mine
And I might put in overtime (that’s right, yeah)
Understanding overnight
You know that I ain't a sober type

[Hook: Miguel & Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
I wanna fuck, yeah, I wanna fuck, yeah

[Verse 3: Justine Skye]
Baby let me know it’s mine
And I'ma put in overtime
That’s right, you’re understanding overnight
You know that I ain’t the sober type
Tell me what you want and I might do it
I’ve been tryna figure out your motive, yeah
Get it up, I put it down, I'ma show you how I do it
Wanna feel them lips all over me
But first I gotta know you’re into me
Ain’t tryna tease
But I’m not the kind of girl that be sleepin' around
Let me tell you how I’m feelin'
If you’re a man, be a man, I'ma give you the world
You gon' have to wait a little
You gon' have to show me that you know my love is strong
Got my heart in the middle
I gotta trust you a little
If I say I will, I’m up for thrill

[Hook: Miguel & Kendrick Lamar]
I wanna fuck right now (right now, right now)
