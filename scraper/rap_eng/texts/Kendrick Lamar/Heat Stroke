[Verse 1]
Live from the area code of 310
Carry the whole city on my back
Knapsack full of goodies, black hoodie, [inaudible]
Fully detach bullets from their own egos, see no evil
Who the hottest out? I'm a give 'em a heat stroke
Summertime, wearin' a peacoat
I be the baddest to ever put a lyric on top of an apparatus
Now trip, that's our flip, I'm a savage
Fabulous wordplay
And you can get served every day without a in-house maid
Be very afraid, I'm nasty with it
Born out the ass of a dragon, flamin', shitted on the masses
This harassment came from Kendrick, givin' out caskets
Puttin' these rappers in it, you fit the image of a dead man
Hennessy and chronic in the same night, so what?
Eyes red like a twelve o'clock fight
