[Intro]
Brodie! I just wanna say something right now bro

[Verse 1: 8 Ounz]
I once knew this girl named Mandy May
Used to see her on campus like everyday
I said her booty was the biz, gotta think I'm sprung
She got me diggin' in my pockets gettin' her hair done (Man!)
She like to ride in the two seat she move right
She's so cool Regina King of the boondocks
She's educational, (I get) Brain like a circuit
Simon forward to anatomy class she's so perfect (her)
Roxy in a Reynolds wrapped on with a skirt on
Sorority sisters never seem to be virgins
What do I say the day I have to meet her father?
I've been chillin' in your daughter since you sent her to college, sir
Cowgirls style is Daisy Dukes and Gucci boots
The good girl to like the bad guy and who's who?
We made a touch screen, video, and bluetooth
I guarantee at least a million hits on Youtube
And I ain't lying momma you the truth
I'm talkin' fly I'll need a parachute to marry you

[Hook] 2X
I swear the college girls is crazy man
I really hope it ain't your lady friend
Cause I got her, And she want it
And Imma' give it, the frat boy is going ham
Now take a picture, fill up the DJ's cup
And keep spinnin', one week to graduation!

[Verse 2: J Capri]
Welcome to college
Where professors and the girls give you knowledge
Ironic, The only place you'll find it
Men wanna hit the chronic and the girls be bondin'
But I'm on a liquor gettin' cells like I'm Sonic
Girls want a nigga cause I'm gettin' iconic
And I'm in
To gettin' hella paper like a saw mist
Find me, in your girls dormitory
And if it's bedtime you already know the story
Stressin' her like a deadline
I be on your campus and your chicks be buggin' me
Like a praying mantis
So I'm only laughin' when chicks is gonna go hard
D cups and straight A's on report cards
Find me in the yard like 36 inches
Chicks on my wood cause you niggas on the benches
Trynna get commas, like a split sentence
Cause when my song leak, college girls be drinkin' it

[Hook] 2X

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Livin' like a student
I'm Drinkin' and smoke pollutin'
The campus is stampin' my signature
I'm sittin' with her!
Her sister is a freak and her cousin is quite petite
And her auntie is thick don't trip her daddy is a minister
And I'm a menace so I jump in it and stick my junk in it
Killed it like I had dumped in it with a AK, Mayday!
With all due respect I'm askin' you for some leg
She said her major was basic, I said my major was sex
She asked me for my number then hit me off with a text
Then we hit it of on her dormitory steps, then we slept
In the library, I don't know how we got there
I just know her name, Carrie
And Block! Her hair was red, Yeah

[Hook]
(So keep livin')

[Verse 4: 8 Ounz]
My head is spinnin' from the sippin' and the light bulbs
I think I picked up the wrong cup I'm so gone
She got my hat on, sneakin' out the back door
Freakin' in the sheets while her roommate is in the dorm
The best performance and the greatest not in my life
We had a good time, but we don't start fights
Cream all the clothes, Adidas shell toes
Cell phones full of memories, peep shows

[Outro]
It's 3, it's 3, 3 in the mornin', mornin'
And every, everybody yawnin', yawnin'
Yeah, we had a good time
I had a good time
We at the frat party
