[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Hey girl
You know you're looking so damn fly
You looking like you fell from the sky (angel)
You know make a grown man cry

And get it off to you

[Chorus: Robin Thicke]
Hey girl

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
You’re like a needle in a haystack
I wanna sit you where my face at
Lunch with a few Mai Tais
Purple kisses on my tie
Life can’t really predict love
Now you’re getting this dick, love
I’m looking for you with a flashlight
I want to feel what a real fat ass feel like
No injection, I learned my lesson
I walk it like I talk it, baby, this pedestrian
Runnin’ through your mind like Jackie Joyner
Pussy pop like (boom!) go get me a burner
Got shot like (boom!)
This can be detrimental
T-shirt and panties, that's your credential
You’re cotton candy, I need a fistful
I’m awful antsy, hope that convince you

[Outro: Robin Thicke]
Hey, girl
You know you're lookin' so damn fly
You lookin' like you fell from the sky (Angel)
You know you make a grown man cry
I wanna give it to you, tonight
And make everything you fantasize
Come true, ooh baby
I'll make it so, so, so amazing
I'll give it to you, tonight
And make everything you fantasize
Come true, ooh baby
I'll make it so, so, so amazing
I'll give it to you
I'll give it to you
