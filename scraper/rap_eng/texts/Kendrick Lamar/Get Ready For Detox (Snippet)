[Lyrics from Snippet]

[Intro: Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg]
La-da-da-dah its the motherfucking d-e-t-o-x
Coming in you know we need funk flex
Radio mobbin while i kick it with D-R-E
You know its dropping in a month and we just packed a little heat
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
You know we got kendrick in this motherfucker
And picked up hittman again
We lighting it off this summer nigga
So just chill and kick waiting for this shit like before
