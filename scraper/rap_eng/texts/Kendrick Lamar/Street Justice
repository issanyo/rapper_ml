They doubted that I’ll ever make it this far
I’m shitting on them now cause I was piss poor
Swear you down to kill with that steel
But that steel don’t make you real
If you can’t even win a fist war
So fuck it, I shoot back at you cowards
Your death the pastor announces
Because we acting on violence
It’s either that or keep silent

Always testing nigga back and back on a challenge
So what’s your choice?
It’s kill or be killed, what?
This life for me was given
It’s pimping or prisons
Visits over missions of your digits
Getting questioned, for nothing
So where you from, you fucker
We busting over discussion
It’s justice to get concussions, huh
You asked for it, might as well get cashed for it
Price is on your head now it’s leaking from the dashboard
Cold world, so keep a heater
If you never trust in Jesus, let me make you a believer!
Meet him
Cause you would do the same
Take aim at niggas brains
And wouldn’t care of no one names
I shot ak’s, handguns and shotguns
Justify your pride, I would stand I would not run, I got mine

[Chorus]
Your heart is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice

This is dedicated, 25 summers I waited
Back when papa was sedated, uncles all incarcerated
25 cousins to play with
Also 2 grandmas I played with
One had died, one moved to Vegas
Both had died, I started raging
Back when LA get the laces
With the blue sprinkles and …
Only broke our concentration
We was broke but mama saved enough
To keep refrigeration stocked
With cut noodles and baken …
The black car was the first to watch
Black boy, first to drop
Then my homie, the first to shoot
Then his homie, the first to drop
So look homie, my best pursuit
Is music, this was finalized
When I seen the devil eyes in that Buick
I was hypnotized

War going on outside, nobody safe from
Kicking your door to ask you where you get your safe from
Kick you some more, you ask me where I get my hate from
Compton, baby, Afghanistan, this is phase one
Compton, … new talibans, central raise one
Rosecrans street tell them coppers get off me, day’s done
Got darker than Alfred mayweather
Never been so cold, 2 sweater and a long nose, they stressing

[Chorus]
When the world is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice

We all like Gingis khan, everyone think they can just become
The punishment of god, but problems never get solved
All the way from Compton’s corner out to Oakland shake it hard
I get a woody wearing hoody, before your eyes just…my marks
And bullets hiding lyrics from myself and Ken Lamar
In the middle of this war, we made it out to be star
Cop cars never came with good cops
I gotta keep it cop just for my neighborhood watch
Street justice

[Chorus]
Your heart is cold and there’s no one to run to
I grab my gun, cause that’s how I know to protect you
Street justice, street justice, street justice, street justice
This is my life, and that’s how I’m gonna protect you
Street justice
