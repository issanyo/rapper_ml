[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar]
It was eye witnessing poverty
Burning bullets allowing these walls breaking
Devour these laws trying to empower me
I thought I knew the reason you grew to love sour diesel
Smoking like locomotive your focus was hourly
And then you caught me your pity party had towered me
Shower me with the will that never dried
I tell you put your worries and friendly doubts to the side
I doubt that you listen, it’s stuck in your system I tried
She’s been miserable, she’s been living in prison
Soaking up life’s reality this is the visual
Baby daddy a light build blade walking with highheel
Paid stalking that avenue, never knew how the light feel, I
Got a plan got a plan for ya
I just just might hold a couple bands for ya
And leave this message in the sand for ya
Tell me you’re ready to change
She said naw nigga it’s part of the game
Just like Heroin

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker]
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and the ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God, please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
Runaway from the fire, I fly downhill
Lay your head over this side, now
You keep pain on the inside, now
Whats been eating you, who's been needing you
You been keeping it down, and
You been taking me higher and higher

[Verse 2: Punch]
Functioning addict, I’m high off her passion
Chasing history’s baddest, I mastered this apparatus
Rackin' my brain, I'm scared of being average
Going against the grain just tryna maintain my savage
Foolish of her to try to play towards my vanity
And foolish of me to let her do it, I love calamity
I love a challenge, naw I love the fantasy
And this is high stakes I risk it all for a pair of snakes
Connect the dot nigga this is fate
I'm talking predestination
I'm talking blind dedication
Plan B is contraception we didn’t make it
Sexercise a little bit of patience
The love of the rush is us
I'm addicted to violence, helicopters, and sirens
Blood pressure is skying, nigga I'm trying
I never felt more alive than I felt dying
Heroin

[Chorus: Lance Skiiiwalker (Lance Skiiiwalker & SZA)]
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, right on time
Please stay paced and ground need you right on time
Say, you right on time
Streets don't fail me now need you right on time
Say, you right on time
God please lift the smile need you right on time
Say, right on time

[Post-Chorus 2: Isaiah Rashad & SZA]
I heard you spending all your time baby (Ohhhhhh)
And you could never get a dime baby (Never get a dime)
At least a nigga got a dime baby (At least a nigga got it)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home)
It's hard to come home (Hard to come home baby)

[Verse 3: Jay Rock &  Kendrick Lamar]
She my gift and my curse, she really quenching my thirst
Baby my vice, she got me driving with no headlights (Is that right?)
She know my thoughts, pleasures, and pain
Everybody love her and she love everybody the same
She said I got a plan, got a plan for ya
I might hold a couple bands for ya
Leave a message in the sand for ya
Tell me you want me to change, hell naw I'm still sippin' the same
Nigga it's just like heroin
