[Intro (Ab-Soul)]
Aw, this is four jiggling balls in your mouth all day everyday
Ay you tuned into a fuck what you hear radio where you can stick a dick in your ear and um
(Stick a dick in my ear??) Aw shut the fuck up bitch but anyway
We got this new K Dot record I know you a trap where you at baby

[Verse 1 (K Dot)]
Down Rosecrans
'87 regal sipping on a gold can
Gun tucked like the fetal, position
Top Dawg coalition coexisting with the coldest you ever quoted from California district
Been a coroner like David Banner I'm the owner
Of the marijuana aroma you're smelling hear the donor yelling it's me bitches
Who did it
I did it
Take 'em where they can't go
Like planet Venus leaning like a mad scientist
Laboratory bottles of empty Heineken telling stories about the ones that came before me
Chinaman squinting his eyes because I'm blinding him, my shine is
Bigger than a strike of lightening they liking him because
I like to win
Never lose
Put me on a pedestal
Bet I pedal victories until I pedal off my shoes
Welcome to the lions room, challenge anybody whom
Wanna try they luck they get fucked up and all you heard was (Oohh)
Say hello to the little big homie, and your reality ain't realer than this homie

[Hook (Ab-Soul) (?)]
Now with my hopes in the back
I could ride like this, or like that
Putting all the bullshit aside
K Dot be too funkdified
Tell him hes too cool, bitches
Holla "what it do", bitches
What's cracking bounce, skate, rock, roll, hello, world, here we go

[Verse 2 (K Dot)]
They be crackin' like a pack of sunflowers seeds
That the devil tree, put my dick on your double D double D's
I learnt that from the dog pound, don't get mad at me
I'm just a product of what was happening in the nineties
Plus my uncle used to fuck with your auntie
Tell me 80 percent ho run in your family
Shame on you
Shame on your mother, sister, cousin too
You all produced the same tendencies
While I continue to stack plently cheese, on my expedition to witness my own odyssey
Out of three, of your favorite bet I give them more flavor like seasoning salt
Call me the Darth Vader invading a raw plot like a space crew, stayed at home
All the gangbangers with the police radars like the Marcus rustle but I hustle
Never change up see my muscle, training like I'm constipated bringing in any drama
If you insist, I'm six for six
Get your ass rolled and twist
Like a blunt rap so fall back
Like winter ended

It's like that (like that?)
Like that (like that?)
Like that (like that?)

[Hook]

[Bridge (K Dot)]
C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I live in
I got more drank bitch bring more friends
Bitch bring more friends

I said C.O.M.P.T.O.N, that's the city that I'm repping
I got more dick bitch bring more friends
Bitch bring more friends

[Outro (Ab-Soul)]
Ahh, callers, callers call up and um, tell me what you think about that new K Dot record
Um who we got on line one
(Hey whats going on man this Jerome man I'm gonna be on Avalon and 135th at the car wash ay ay ay fuck that nigga K Dot man he owe me five dollars straight up)
Man shut your broke ass up, um next caller man who we got on line two

Oh shut yo ass up girl that nigga don't even wear drawers
Nah for real I'm just fuckin' with y'all next caller
(Yeah man that song harder than a motherfucker dog on the real ya'll need a run that back)

[Hook]
