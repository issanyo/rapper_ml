[Hook: Cisco & Sophie Stern]
Don't wait too long
I don't wanna wait til the moments gone
I don't wanna play that same love song
Over and over

[Verse 1: Shwayze]
Started out good ended up bad
You like a pop song all stuck up in my head
Finally read the lyrics understood what they meant
When I spent all my money and my God damn rent
Now I'm tryna figure out if it was worth it
Matter of fact I know the answer, it was no bitch
Chilling on the island with my feet up on the beach
But being raised on the beach couldn't prepare me for these bitches
And these sand sharks and how they try to sink they teeth in
I'm just body surfing tryin not to hit the reef
All they wanna see a brother do is sink
But I'm a ride this shit til my shit don't stink
I'm a sing my heart out sing til I can't breathe
I'm a mean every note even if it's off key
Please go head and leave
I wouldn't wait for you so don't wait for me

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Shwayze]
If I didn't rhyme with Sony
Would you still wanna bone me
How come in the full room I can still feel lonely
My grandmama said watch out for them phonies
And them motherfuckers say it's haters tryna be your homie
And you see you on top they want a little piece of it
But they ain't getting nothin
It's going to my nieces and my cousins
I'm having babies by the dozens
Pop 'em out the oven like an Egg McMuffin
Always up to nothing
But baby you're something
Like it when you're bumping down the street in your pumpkin
Wishing it was just you and me in the moment
I'm thinking that it's summer
You're sipping the Corona and I'm humming a song that you love
And you tell me that you love it
Just then we feel the buzz and our bodies start touching
Even though I know how it ends I don't want to interrupt it

[Hook]

[2nd Hook: Cisco & Sophie Stern]
Over and over
Like a record that's broken
Over and over
Like you say that we're through
Over and over
Over and over
I came back to you
Now that it's over
Oh no

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Welcome to the story of my life, the mis-education of Kendrick
Stressin Hennesy shots throw 'em back like it's vintage
Wondering can I live where is the generosity
Something's just gotta give, tryna stay positive
My motives to be a mogul, searching for a dollar without compromising my vocals
Really I'm just a noble kid from the westside of Compton
My cousins were selling crack while we play Sonic
You niggas is nonsense
I say that you full of shit
And need a colonic or maybe the Heimlich maneuver to throw up what you consume
My shine is bright enough to make a dead flower bloom in a room full of curtains
I'm for certain that I'm certainly popping the pistol verbally
And never will I get shot, your aim is all fucked up as if your sidekick dropped
I'm nice with a... throw over and over again
You know who I do it for
Me, me

[Hook]
