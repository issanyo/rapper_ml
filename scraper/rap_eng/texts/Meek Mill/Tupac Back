2Pac back, 2Pac back
There's all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better Picture Me Rollin'
Riding brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I'm stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming 2Pac back, 2Pac back
There's all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back

[Meek Mill]
Huh, 2Pac back, I'm 2 Glocks strapped
Rolling down in Philly this the new Iraq
Soon as I hit the the hood they screaming who got wacked
It's a recession on the work, I'm screaming who got crack
I'm sippin Hennessy, riding on my muthafucking enemies
Sliding in the back screamin MMG (Maybach Music)
10 bitches and they dime so it's Tennessee
Hail Mary, put my wrist on froze
Presidential is gold, nigga play with my money my Jeweller lifting his soul
40 kick like in soccer? Bullets hittin' the goal
Bitch I'm like John Wall cause I just give em and go
Plotting on this new 7, I can picture me rolling
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I could loan, all them snitches could hold em
Look at them muthafuckin' wheels, them bitches is stolen
They screamin'

[Meek Mill]
Mommy a soldier, daddy is dead
Catch the nigga that did it, and we gon' carry his head
Fuck 911, tell em have him in bed
Talking Death Row Records, tell 'em have me a chair
Let it burn, I'm screaming free my nigga Earl?
He's due in, no hesitation we can't even get a turn
Copped my Makaveli CD and I listened then I learned
Grabbed my Mac above the dresser, my OG's say hold it firm
I'm dreaming spitting with Pac, cyphers with BIG
Try to send me upstate with life as the bid
Had me scraping my wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like there's a price on my head
I'm going max, got me knocking suckers on they back
In these cells, raising hell, tryna get back to the trap
But don't ever get it twisted it's Meek Mill spittin' facts
Plus somebody said they seen it and they mean it so they steady screaming
