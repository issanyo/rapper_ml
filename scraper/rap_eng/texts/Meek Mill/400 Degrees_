[Meek Mill]
I eat, shit, sleep, and I talk cake
I got bitches from Miami, Atlanta you up state
My whole team get money we all straight
Y'all suckers fall for [?]
I been about that paper they know that its all facts
I'm the type to remix your hoe won't call back
And I ain't got no chill button can't fall back
Cause real niggas real I think that I'm all that
I be, bending corners in a Wraith 11
Riding shotty but I got a mac 11
Try to rob me I'mma send you back to...

But I take nothing just watch I gon' show ya
I touchdown NYC and call Karen
And tell her call [?]
Its all lit, balling we all in
Me and SBOE I call him
I make it rain, let it go New Orleans

I can tell you ain't never had bitches
Look around all I see is mad niggas
Throw bands all you suckers should really be glad nigga
She gon' bust it for a real nigga
And I'mma throw a stack back
She gon' bust it for a real...

[Swae Lee]
Watch as I pull up in your bitch spot
I'mma fuck the bitch and then tell her kick rocks
Young Swae Lee I don't like 'em on my jock
Fuck her one time then I kick her out the drop
I'm a young nigga but my wrist and my money old
Fuck you bitch nigga know I got to get it on
I'm a young rich nigga...
