[Hook: K Smith]
I tell them fuck you talking about I been getting money
I got a million niggas still hating on me
I tell that ho I did that
I tell that ho I did that
Gone go go go
I tell that ho I did that
I tell that ho I did that

[Verse 1: K Smith]
About another week my wrist gon' be on chill
Shout out to my home boy Chilly Chill
Shout out to my home boy Meek Mill
We be celebrating after big deals
And I be with my Philly niggas
Fuck you talking about we be in the real business
Alright I tell that ho I did that
Alright I tell that ho I did that

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I'm jumping out of that coop
Shitting on them like oops
Me and K Smith up in the spaceship the bitch growl at you like woof
And I don't love these hoes I'm like Snoop
Wasted on that Loso
Niggas smoking that Cali kush that shit loud as my 44
Only thing free around here hot shells and some promo
I get a stripper bitch and when I hit the bitch tell her treat the dick like that pole ho
Ya know tell that ho I did that
Me and K up in the building you know where your bitch at, gone

[Hook]

[Verse 3: YG]
Ya I did that ya I did that
Louie belt where my four fifth at
When it chit-chat it go click-clack
Keep the strap right where my dick at
Nigga got everything on lock
Put my name on that flyer nigga everything gon' pop
Ya my hoes be eating my profit
These old niggas be hating
I eat curry chicken like a nigga was Jamaican
Your bitch keep on waving so I'mma keep on surfing
I spent 20 on my Rolex she ask me was worth it
I said

[Hook]
