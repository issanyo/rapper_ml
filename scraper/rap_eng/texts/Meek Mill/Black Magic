Poof, there go the car

Could you knock that hoe? Could you blame that bitch?
'Cause you wanna roll with a real nigga like me
Then go and suck that dick like hoe to a fiend
Fuck throat when I lean, take long on a purp

Mad hoe on the beam, still money over these hoes
Got YSL on my clothes and blood drip on my sneakers
Nigga, you hating on me, she chose
And I ain't fuck your girl, she role

My stick shift, she drove did everything that she 'pose
I pull my camera out and she posed
And I was like goddamn, drop that, pop that
Got the top back, on a drop back, I'm back

In a Glock, where the crotch at? I'm strapped where the rocks at?
Where the watch at? Stop that, you got that, got that
Got racks, y'all niggas ain't about that, about that life

Poof, there go the car
Poof, there go the crib
Poof, a hundred mill
Woop, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield

Poof, there go the car
Poof, there go the crib
Poof, a hundred mill
Woop, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield

Poof, niggas fuck your life, fuck y'all niggas and fuck your wife
Got two bad bitches with a nigga and they ain't know
They gonna fuck all night and I rock hard white

Niggas, wrist game pride, I pull up on the horse
And I'm sitting on fours in a big boy drive
Call big boy shot, all clear stones in my big boy watch
All year long got the strip on lock

Every time we in this bitch, man, she ain't gonna pop
My hip on Glock, your hip on nothing
My niggas got racks, your niggas be frontin'

Red Cartier, red bone bitch, red bottoms on her
Hair long as shit, hold up, yellow gold rub, yellow bone hoe
And yellow bottoms, it's paid, nigga, hoe, I'm made niggas

Poof, there go the car
Poof, there go the crib
Poof, a hundred mill
Woop, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield

Poof, there go the car
Poof, there go the crib
Poof, a hundred mill
Woop, David Copperfield
David Copperfield, David Copperfield
