[Verse 1] Phat Geez
If rap don't work then it's right back to the block
Tryin' have trips to Miami, Spanish bitch on a yacht
With my feet up in the air and a bottle of Ciroc
With a pocket full of hunnits screaming nigga, this the life
Anywhere I'm going, I never tuck my ice
If a nigga snatch my chain then, I'mma take his life
Cause I done seen it all, when niggas grow up playing basketball
And wasn't living right, then started movin' that hard
Growin' up seeing my dad behind the bars, even made me a man
And wanted me to grind hard
Mom single parent, she work her ass off
That's why, when I'm make it mom you gone have it all
Whatever you want, make sure when you shop buy all types of stuff, That you don't even need, Make sure Jah stay in the gym, Next it's the league, watching my big brother popping percs and smoking weed brothers, that's still my brother don't let nothing get in between, what up!

[Chorus]
Cause this is the life
Get left wasn't living too right (aye)
Turn your back for a minute, then your closest friends
Wind up taking you out (aye) x2

[Verse 2] Phat Geez
You ever been up all night with a millionaire?
Looking at ice, talking 'bout life, like am I really here?
I'm on that Beanie Sigel, I feel it in the air
Niggas is snakes, talk to the jakes, man, they ain't playing fair, (rats)
Plus the judge tryna give Two a hundred years
I know my nigga like, damn I'm gone be stuck in there
Cause it ain't no love in there, ain't no trust in there
Niggas partyin and poppin' bottles they forgot you there
Damn, will be the ones you thought was fam, turn they back give you the breeze, just like a fan, but this is the life when you ain't living too right

[Chorus]

[Verse 3] Meek Mill
Oh, Aye Phat I got you
Nigga make the money, and don't let it make the team
Go to sleep broke, bet you that'll make a dream
Fuck her on a perc 10 that'll make her scream
With attention by a rafe, nigga, that'll make a scene
I done seen everybody go against' me
So I'm riding with a Glock that hold 50
Lookin' like a stick tied to a frisbree
Started off walking, now I got a Bentley, you dig me?
My neck looking like a nigga stole something, (froze)
Got your favorite rapper asking could I hold something? (woah)
But we ain't letting niggas hold nothing, (no)
Nigga my ghost so new, can't hear the Rolls runnin'
My money right, my bitches bad
Fuck a supermodel, get a cab, send her home, she was mad
What a feeling when you get to count a million cash
Work on the table, dope on the scale
This shit that we selling get you 20 years in jail
Did my dog dirty gave him 20 years in hell
And Boost just touched a hunnit 20 for the bail
A nigga hit my line like let me hold 50
I laughed then I strapped up so quickly, Me and Deen, met him it was so risky, (it was) new machine
Drummer like you throw frisbee, Riding round with Coon in the low Bently, Got Omelly in the back he got the cold grizzly
On, lookin' at you niggas in a old Bently, Lil' coupes
Ballin' like its yours, swoops
I done seen niggas spend all they money, and get it back
I done seen niggas spending the money that get 'em whacked
Cause they got fronted a brick and them numbers can get em back, Just for frontin' like they got it, then buyin' these bitches bags, niggas mad, niggas rats I see em' they lookin' past
They dont look me in my eyes, I see em they gettin' tagged
I see em, they getting tagged, they dont look me in my eyes
I see em they getting tagged

[Chorus]
