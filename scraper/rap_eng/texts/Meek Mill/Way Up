[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Turn them headphones up, Cruz
Way up
Shit, like I'm Jackie Chan
Summer is lit and we back again

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Can't believe they tried to play us (What?)
Run a check and tell 'em pay up (Run it)
It's all business, ain't no favors (Woo)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Summer comin', better save up (It's comin!)
Going up like elevators (Comin up!)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up, way up, way up)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
That indirect shit never get by us
Niggas like bitches be dick ridin'
Funny how nigga like Rich Pryor
See 'em and I smack the shit out 'em
Throwin' ten k like it's ten dollars
I grab that bitch, make a ten out her
I pop a Perc, fuck the shit out her
Fuck her so good, thought I care 'bout her
She know I been 'bout it, I'm on my way up
My chick a Barbie, no weave and no makeup
Hang with the trappers, don't be with no haters
My city gon' tell you that we on some paper
Theolonius capers when I'm in that Wraith
I'm feelin' like Meechie '03 ATL
Purp got leanin' like I'm on a rail
Mixing that Birk with that new YSL
Sellin' that dope gave me confidence
Bust down the Role gave me confidence
I let the fiend wash the coupe, tell him, "Polish it"
She on my dick, I can't make you no promises
Bahgdad on that pussy, bombin' shit
Bad bad with that chopper, Osama shit
Rockin' Givenchy shit
Trap at the clear port, nigga, we flyin' shit

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Can't believe they tried to play us (What?)
Run a check and tell 'em pay up (Run it)
It's all business, ain't no favors (Woo)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Summer comin', better save up (It's comin!)
Going up like elevators (Comin up!)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up, way up, way up)

[Verse 2: Tracy T]
Way up, way up, way up
Skinny nigga walkin' like done got his weight up
Hold up, bitch, I'm movin' fast, they holler, "Wait up"
Fixin' bitches just so I can fuck and break her
I been doin' this since Jacob came with Jacobs
If you know me, then you owe me, fuck you pay up
Bombin' in Atlana a.k.a. Al-Queda
Crossin' up I'm Kyrie Irving with the lay up
Pushin' whips and poppin' pistols for the paper
Goin' up, they want to stop your elevator
Havin' lunch on top of Barneys, feelin' way up
Paper on Rodeo, aye ho, I got flavor
Meek Milly pull up that Wraith up
I pull up with work like I'm Rayful
Put tens on that bitch for the haters
That work it came in from Laredo
Got birds and got bricks and they came in the trailer
Them niggas ain't poppin' shit, got a shot on me like Peja StojakoviÄ‡
Broke the law, fuck it, lil' nigga, it got me rich
Ya you might got a gun but you ain't poppin' it
Nigga doin' dirty business, goddamn, Lord save 'em
Dirty money on the low, it got me way up, way up, way up

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Can't believe they tried to play us (What?)
Run a check and tell 'em pay up (Run it)
It's all business, ain't no favors (Woo)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up)
Summer comin', better save up (It's comin!)
Going up like elevators (Comin up!)
I'm so way up, way up, way up, way up (Way up, way up, way up)
