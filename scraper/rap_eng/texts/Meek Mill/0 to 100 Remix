[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Rat nigga got my chain snatched
And he didn't even get the chain back
On the news with the police, now he talking on twitter I ain't playing that
Fuck all that Meek you gotta chill shit
I be on some get a nigga killed shit
Put a hundred bands on you real quick
My Philly niggas make a movie outcha Will Smith
Oh lord oh lord what you yelling nigga
Penthouse nice fresh out the cellar nigga
All that white like what you selling nigga
My chain look like a Coogi with all these colors nigga
I be on money since nineteen, twenty
I may be twenty-one I have bout 3hunnid
And I ain't talking bout Chief Keef or Lil' Reese
But all my niggas keep heat a little piece
With a drum on that bitch no chicken all beef
For you fuck ass rappers that be talking they all sweet
Last night I hit my hood with all my chains on
Two hundred fifty thou had a Mulsanne on
A broke nigga get it from me and his pain gone
But he'll never get it from me he'll get rained on
I tell em wear it to your funeral be stuntin' while they viewing you
Everybody goons 'til we send that 32 at you
Sipping on lean with the percs pharmaceutical
Just so I can get in my bag in the studio
Headshot we ain't shooting low
So many holes in ya they gone call you Julio
Oops I mean Hole-I-O, Holyfield knows heâ€™s broke
Shooting at your Rolls Royce turn it to the holy ghost
Holy smokes, caught the whole thing that was overdose
Overkill watched the news so I know its real

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
That's why I'm like fuck y'all niggas
Cause I ain't never trust y'all niggas
And I be like fuck y'all bitches
And I'll never cuff y'all bitches
Cause these hoes ain't loyal and niggas ain't either
When it go down you calling for hittas that you ain't feeding
You ain't real nigga
Your day ones ain't even still with you
You left them starving you an ill nigga
Same niggas you calling to kill with you
But I be in the field nigga
And when it come to money I get it
I fill up banks like Uncle Phil nigga word
Word fuck these bitches get a bird serve
Whoever got it never splurge splurge
Cause when the money going that's when all the honeys rolling
They gone kick you to the curve

[Outro: Meek Mill]
One time for Lil' Snupe R.I.P
Whole squad on that real shit
And you know I was always taught
If them niggas ain't feeding you how you going to ride for them
I was in that position
Loyalty before royalty
I tell my niggas stay down stay close to that money nigga we gon' ball forever
Dreamchasers for life
