[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Uh, young street nigga tryin' make some millions
I know you hear me but you gotta feel me
These niggas talk about it but they never did shit
And we ain't really smellin' that shit
When you made it out the slums then you the trillest
Runnin' with ya day ones, yeah, you the realest
Uh, I know you hear me but you gotta feel me
A young nigga tryin' make some millions

[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
Uh, live from the projects
Any hood, know I still got on all my shit
100K on my neck, die for my respect
Tryin' ride on the kid, fuck around and wreck
Play, you dyin' next, Uh, tool number one got 'em upset
I've been on my young fly shit since a lil jit, true shit
A whole lot of broomsticks what we move with
Don't be jumpin' in shit you ain't got nothin' to do with
Sweep ya block like a hall sweep, y'all all sweet
Never been the type to call off beef, don't call me
Nigga talkin' 'bout he gon' off me, they lost me
They tryin' do me like Jesus, they tryin' cross me
I'ma give a nigga the full clip 'til it's all E
After bloodshed ain't no sorry, I'm sorry
We was all broke now we all kings
Gotta get the fuck up out the hood by any means
We all G's

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Uh, young street nigga tryin' make some millions
I know you hear me but you gotta feel me
These niggas talk about it but they never did shit
And we ain't really smellin' that shit
When you made it out the slums then you the trillest
Runnin' with ya day ones, yeah, you the realest
Uh, I know you hear me but you gotta feel me
A young nigga tryin' make some millions

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Shout out my niggas that stayed down
That's why they still with me, I came up
Got some money and look what they sayin' now
Bet they tell you them niggas, they stand up
I manned up and I turned a dollar to a thousand
Turned a thousand to a million, moved my moms from public housin'
Had to put her in that mansion, from the hood I got an island
And they tell me that I'm losin', man you niggas fuckin' wildin'
When they killed Lil' Snupe, I took a L
Young trap niggas from the bottom, we prevailed
We done got expelled 'fore they taught us how to spell
We ain't never go to math but knew them numbers on that scale
Bustin' bricks sellin' bales, I ain't never tell
Only thing a nigga takin' from me is a shell
Hood of broken dreams, we ain't used to raisin' hell
If you was from my hood, you would never get a sale
Fuck nigga!

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Uh, young street nigga tryin' make some millions
I know you hear me but you gotta feel me
These niggas talk about it but they never did shit
And we ain't really smellin' that shit
When you made it out the slums then you the trillest
Runnin' with ya day ones, yeah, you the realest
Uh, I know you hear me but you gotta feel me
A young nigga tryin' make some millions
