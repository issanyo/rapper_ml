[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Catch you out in traffic, it's you and I
Gold 41 in a suit and tie, nigga it's do or die
Seen it now, if I lose it all like who would ride?
But nigga I'm so up, if I tripped it's like suicide
When the internet told me I'm crucified
They was in them streets like, "Nigga you super live"
I was on the block when you was a sneakerhead
Nigga it's a check up in that box, ain't no shoe inside
Nigga ain't no Nike, ain't no Yeezy, no Jordan V
I came back like I'm Mike wearin' 45
Ever seen 50 grand when it's all in 5s?
But I'm shootin' like the Warriors' startin' 5, swish!
Only rapper went gold without a verse from Hov
Still got the rock with me, cookin' up at the stove
And the Rollie all platinum, know I bust it at Joe
Maybach in the hood, so them suckers can know
I'm in the 6, man, 6 man, Dion Waiters
And I'm on my level now, I'm so beyond haters
Bout to go and grab the Benz truck, see y'all later
When I came through the block, you should've seen y'all faces
This is slaughter, new world order
I be goin' hard, Westbrook, 4th quarter
This is hip-hop, you ain't write it, don't record it
I don't know how they gettin' down 'cross the border
I give 'em the dirty flow, Michigan and water
Sent them 10 thousand cases, I put in my order
Call that poppin' bottles when my people can't afford it
Mixin' D'usse with lemonade when I'm in Georgia
Views from the projects, and nigga I'm the prospect
Talkin' loud, say I'm shootin' out with metal objects
And that chick standin' right beside you, I done popped that
Made me beat a fan up, I'm feelin' like I'm Artest, woo!
Gold mic from the billboards, 'bout to plug it up
Tell Cruz put it in the booth so I can fuck it up
Got the hood super lit, jumpin' like it's double dutch
From the bottom like an uppercut, now I'm all the way up
I'm all the way up
You niggas all the way fucked
Switched sides, now you stuck (stay over there my g)
Fuck them niggas though

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
They don't wanna see you on top
I just wanna see the streets up
They don't wanna see you up
That's it
They gon' take shots when you all the way up
I guess they gotta aim up at you
But don't you let these nobodies get their name up on you
Keep the circle tight, never let 'em lame up the crew
If she for everybody, don't you let her claim up on you
Now listen, you gave up on me, I came up on you
Took my talents somewhere else, LeBron James up on you
I was Kyrie with the rock, the crack game number 2
Now I'm older, still ballin' like my name Uncle Drew
They tell you... stay the same, but they change up on you
Niggas change up the crew like hoes change up their boo
I just played the cards they dealt me 'til a change-up was due
Guess I had to switch the dealer or just change up the shoe
Now blackjack, Ace of Spade and a shot of Jack
I met a bad actress, she ain't know how to act
I took her but I brought her back
Don't want her back, I bought her bag
Matte like Hasselbeck, I call my car a quarterback
If I threw it at her would you doubt she could catch?
She hang like a chain so she 'bout to get snatched
Ain't about throwin' subs, I'm about gettin' scratches
But if the shoe fits, nigga, buy an outfit to match it
And you know my boys hold it, we be out with the ratchets
I heard your boys told her you be out with the rats
Keep that on the "Shhhh!‚Äù, nothing less, nothing more
I know the Bad Boys in Brooklyn, they ain't with the Puffy tour
What's up with your Warriors? They ain't lookin' tough no more
Should get out your feelings bro, and get in your duffle, boy
Level up, level up, it's all about that level up
Hold that fuckin' bezel up and light this bitch all the way up

[Verse 3: Jadakiss]
Meek called me and Fab, Joe called Jigga up
She jumped in the 6, 550 wasn't big enough
Reason niggas die, they don't know how to live enough
They can tread water, but they can't swim enough
Nah, I'm built for the physical outing
Besides that, I'm filthy, like municipal housing
J all I know is 500, getchu a thousand
I be in all the hood spots you not allowed in
Opps in the building, automatically alert that
Hand on the wrist so the chrome don't jerk back
Pull it out, you already know you gotta squirt that
I'm all the way up I'm from where the phones don't work at
You gon' need the key from the lobby to slide up
You don't know the key to the body is mind up
Born with it then you don't gotta get signed up
Gotta go when you gotta go, your times up
Extendos, no need for keeping the 9's tucked
I'm kicking you off the ladder for trying to climb up
Yup, overlooking the city
I'm all the way up, I'm like Hov looking at Biggie
It's 50 in the bank, who rollin'? Shoot the 50
If I ace, then these niggas think they hit me
But I'm all the way up

[Outro]
All the way up
I'm all the way up
All the way up
All the way up
And everytime you see me nigga
Man I'm all the way up
