ONLY A SNIPPET, NOT FULL SONG

[Hook]
Gettin' money is the hobby I'm so sorry
Gettin' money is the hobby I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby
I'm so sorry X8
Gettin' money is the hobby I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby
I'm so sorry X8
Gettin' money is the hobby I'm so sorry I'm so sorry
Got a bad bitch running through the lobby
I'm so sorry

[Verse: Meek Mill]
Uh, pockets all fat like Terio
Cus we sellin' O's like cheerios
Off the rope on your ho Rey Mysterio
Let the beat build bitch now here we go
Hol' up, it ainâ€™t even drop yet
But I'm ridin' in the coupe with the top back
Got that slidin' round with the seat dropped back
Gettin' head till I tell the ho to stop that
Catch me club lib with a 34
Naw you ain't ready though
Hoes tryin to hit the bank like set it off
Spit crack while eyes already raw
Rock ready, ready rock ho let it pause
Nigga you don't ever ball
Ho changed for the money like menopause
So what I do treat the ho like Santa Clause
Hey ho, Meek Milly got gifts for a
I heard homie got this for ya
They got that so I'ma give the dick to ya
And if you do it good I'ma give a tip to ya
Drip to ya bust it open on the eyelid
You clocked out right around the time I signed in
Now shorty wanna kick it like Chi Lin
Cus I pull strings like a violin

[Hook]

[Verse: Meek Mill]
I used to pray to get a hundred grand
Now it's cartiers for the rubber bands
And that uzi sounded just like [?]
Did I, did I, did I, did I stutter fam
Bad bitch lookin' like J-Lo
And she gone do whatever I say so
