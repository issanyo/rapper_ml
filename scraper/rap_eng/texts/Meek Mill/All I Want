[Intro: Meek Mill]
I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more
Yeah, niggas be seeing me stunting, know I'm getting all these dollars
I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more, I want more
Nigga still getting these hundreds, know I got all of these (all I want, all I need)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
And all I really wanna do, all I really wanna do, hey
Is put my hands on your body, just roll up with you
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a nigga want is you
Liquor got me stupid
Now, baby, tell me what you want to do, hey (all I want, all I need)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Hold up, hold up
She was from the Westside, said it was the best side
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Little bit of hood with a swag like Left Eye
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Pussy so good, want to put in a rap line
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
I put my face all up in it, get baptized (woo!)
Plus 5, plus 5, she was that fine, go to sleep all in it like nap time (woo! Oh Lord)
She woke up like this with her ass all on me from the backside
She want to do the surfboard, just tryna be like Beyoncé (surfboard)
And if she always do it this good then she might just be my fiancée (wife her)
I want more, I want more and now damn, I want yours
Thinking like how did we get on the floor?
From the couch to the bed when we came in the door
And I came from the door like

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
And all I really wanna do, all I really wanna do, hey
Is put my hands on your body, just roll up with you
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a nigga want is you
Liquor got me stupid
Now, baby, tell me what you want to do, hey (all I want, all I need)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
And all I really wanna do, all I really wanna do, hey
Is put my hands on your body, just roll up with you
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a nigga want is you
Liquor got me stupid
Now, baby, tell me what you want to do, hey (all I want, all I need)

[Post-Chorus: Chris Brown]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah

[Bridge: Chris Brown & (Meek Mill)]
I know that you fake niggas ain't real (ha, ain't real)
That's why we take your girls and make money, make money (get money)
A double cup and a whole bag of them pills (why?)
I hear them on the pole and they shake something, shake something (let's get it)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Damn, look what you started
We done turned my crib into an after party
And all I really wanna do, all I really wanna do, hey
Is put my hands on your body, just roll up with you
All I want is you, all I want is you
All a nigga want is you
Liquor got me stupid
Now, baby, tell me what you want to do, hey (all I want, all I need)
