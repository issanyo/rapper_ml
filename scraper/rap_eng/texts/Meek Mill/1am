Fuck her and her friend, that's a AND1, one (that's a AND1 one)
Dirty nigga, all these hundreds made me handsome, ah
Bunch of pretty bitches on the yacht (on the yacht)
Treat a supermodel like a thot (like a thotty)
Swervin' down Collins in a drop (skrt skrt)
Thirty shots on me, that's a mob

Swipe a black card up in Neiman's, ah

Trap god living like a kingpin, ah
Got your baby daddy sick (that's bad)
On the 'gram, leavin' comments on my pics (he mad)
Get your man, baby, before I get him hit (burr burr)
'Cause I ain't playin', girl, I'm really with the shits

[Chorus]
1 am, we probably be at the club
2 am, we probably leavin' the club
All the bad bitches, yeah, they leavin' with us
Pull up, Lamborghini, got them eatin' the dust, oh lord

[Verse 2]
Ah, V.I.P. for all the P.Y.T.s
Puffy up in the session, we doing B.I.G.s
I'm notorious just for sportin' these Givenchys
Said she wanted some Molly, need to see her I.Ds
Get her smokin' on cookie, now looky, she Chinese
When I ask her if she goin', that mean, that she gotta leave
Like we taking a picture, baby, we got cheese
Came first five minutes, damn, she not pleased
I'm like, "Hold up," Uber on the way right now, uh
With a rich nigga, pipe down, uh
Pussy so wet, I drowned, uh
Go again? Baby, not now
12:45, I'm on my way to the club (we lit)
D'usse and me, baby, I ain't talkin' no drugs (no drugs)

She don't want a good boy, she wanna stay with a thug, forreal

[Chorus]
1 am, we probably be at the club
2 am, we probably leavin' the club
All the bad bitches, yeah, they leavin' with us
Pull up, Lamborghini, got them eatin' the dust, oh lord

[Verse 3]
Bad bitch (hold up), that's a bad bitch (hold up)

Type of money turn a boujee bitch ratchet (boujee, boujee)
Type of paper turn a boujee bitch ratchet, oh (boujee bitch)
Bad bitch (hold up), that's a bad bitch (hold up)
Pretty gang in real life, she ain't a catfish (yikes)
Got her hair and nails done and her ass did (ass did)
Got her hair and nails done and her ass did, ah
Shittin' on 'em like like a port-a-potty (shit, yikes)
Slid up in her DM and I caught a body (nice)
I won't hit it raw, we ain't goin' to Maury (no way)
Like a waterfall, all this water on me

[Chorus]
1 am, we probably be at the club
2 am, we probably leavin' the club
All the bad bitches, yeah, they leavin' with us
Pull up, Lamborghini, got them eatin' the dust, oh lord
