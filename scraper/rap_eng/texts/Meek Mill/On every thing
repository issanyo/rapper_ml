[Meek Mill]
See, I'm an A1 type of guy
I crush A1 hoes (true)
Rock A1 clothes (true)
Drive A1 whips (true)
And still pour A1 sauce on my shit
Huh, I come from the bottom

Huh, crushing all these hoes, rocking all this ice
Selling all these Os, nigga, I done did that twice
So I'm just riding round in my Rolls, bout to get on my bike
Just to touchdown in my hood, and I put that on my life
I'm like, yeah nigga, I'm there nigga, I ball hard all year nigga
My diamonds all clear nigga, smack my chain, you dead nigga
I don't know what you heard, and I don't know what you thought
But all my dogs they murk, and all my dogs go hard, fuck that
My new young chick look exactly like Rihanna
Ass like Nicki, but she yellow like Madonna
I take her to the mall, buy her all type of designers
YSL, fly Chanel, all that Dolce & Gabbana
I jump right back like thirty-six, lean hard when I turn the whip
If I ain't have my rap deal, then I'd still be serving bricks
I kill a pussy, I murder shit, homicide on shorty
My gold Role' cost sixty racks and my rose gold cost forty

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
I get A1 money, I'm an A1 nigga
Got an A1 swagger, I'm getting A1 bitches
I just bought me a Rollie, you can skate on nigga
If they don't love it, they hate it, well get your hate on nigga
Cause I got A1 everything, A1 everything
A1 everything, I get A1 everything
I got A1 credit, A1 hoes
I drive A1 whips and I rock A1 clothes, I'm gone

[Kendrick Lamar]
Pray to God I washed my hand, but I'll be damned
2012, one-hundred racks to Uncle Sam
A twenty-four year old millionaire
Don't read the contract 'less a mill in there
A1 credit, park my car bow-legged
I got a bus full of bitches, I call it Jerome Bettis
I grab my dick in the picture, your hoe be cropping the image
I'll let you scrape off the dishes, we eating nigga, I'll finish
And come right back, hope you insomniac
Sleep on me if you wanna take a dirt nap
Bitch I'm talking ca-ca-ca-ca, then more ca-ca-ca-ca
Hit your roof until I pop your top up, then more ca-ca-ca-ca till I know I got ya
Balling like I'm balding, then I see Jordan in the mirror
Nigga that's flawless VVS, said CC text me what you wearing
Putting my all inside your bitch, I grip her hips, that's power steering
Bout to hydroplane when I board that plane, I land inside the building

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
