[Intro: Meek Mill]
Chopsquad
How many of y'all niggas wanna go against me?
We kill all you mothafuckin' haters
You know how long it took me to get here and y'all niggas still talkin'?
R.I.P. to Lil Snupe

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
You wanna see a dead body, come roll with Ricky
My wrist and neck cost a Bugatti, I'm smokin' sticky
They think I'm in Illuminati, thought that I was sinnin'
Shit, all them years that I was starvin', and now I'm filthy
I wanna see my haters dead, talkin' bloody murder
Cause when it's beef I give 'em bread and make a fucking burger
And every time I hear 'em shooting, I get fucking nervous
We put them Ghosts back to back, it look like fucking hearses
Killing niggas, kill them all, funeral stickers
Lord please forgive them they not know what I do to these niggas
Be with pira√±as in the water to chew through these niggas
They killed my homie we came back and hit two of them niggas

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Lord, please forgive them they not know
Lord, please forgive them they not know
Lord, please forgive them they not know
And when we hit them bless their souls
The devil coming  and I seen it
We fear Allah only I mean it
And Inshallah my soul the cleanest
Committed sins and I redeemed it
Lord please forgive them they not know (we let 'em go if they not know)
Lord please forgive them they not know (we let 'em go if they not know)
Lord please forgive them they not know (we let 'em go if they not know)
And when we hit them bless they souls (lord)

[Interlude: Dex Osama]
I done seen the motherfucking reaper standing over me
Momma crying like "You gotta change your life son. You got death on you and shit."
I'm like, "Damn!" you hip?
I'm like I'm about to die but I don't know when
I just know I'm about to die soon, you hip?
Like this motherfucker just came and gave me a visit

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Look in my eyes, what do you see?
Heart of a killer I pull up they looking surprised, what could it be?
Is it the money, the hoes, I'm feeling the vibe, I'm still in the streets
And shoutout to niggas that's still on my side cause niggas capisce
So it's any means necessary, no love not in February
They gave my dawg life so he come home like a Nevuary
Was never scary I hit the lights and say, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary, Bloody Mary
Lately, I been lurking where the reaper creeping we been creeping
Hit a nigga 20 times, leave him sleeping, see him leaking, we the reason
He was fresh to death like it was Easter weekend
Mama selling dinner platters when that boy got hit with ladders
No insurance, no informants, close the case
Open casket I'm like how they closed his face
And I got cake and I can't lie I cannot wait to stop back by and set y'all straight

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Lord, please forgive them they not know
Lord, please forgive them they not know
Lord, please forgive them they not know
And when we hit them bless they souls
The devil coming and I seen it
We fear Allah only I mean it
And Inshallah my soul the cleanest
Committed sins and I redeemed it
Lord please forgive them they not know (let them go if they not know)
Lord please forgive them they not know (let them go if they not know)
Lord please forgive them they not know (let them go if they not know)
And when we hit them bless they souls
