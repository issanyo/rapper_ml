Wiggle her on a hundred thousand million like I’m made with it

[Verse 1: J Doe]
Okay, I make them hoes stop, they staring when they see me
And my space ship rolled up, they glare off that missed me
Sign is so damn hard, they compare it to a motherfucker
To a nord star, speaking of start, get me
When you see me make a wish, I be shippin burbon
Bitches try to blow a kiss, I walked up in the club
And I ain’t on the fucking list
DJ see me and they be like “J-Doe in this bitch”
Then the club turn up
Get my kick game mean, I be rocking everything
The chain never seen, I ain’t got a scuff on me
Boy you know I’m clean, they said that they had ‘em
But it’s only in the dream, wake up motherfucker
I’m a boss in reality, thick bitch with me
‘Bout to help her burn some callories, ride in that Gucci plea
She grabbin’ my anathomy, I casualty throwed that back
Rover and you know it was over… oh yeah…

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I said I make them hoes stop and stare, when I ride this Audemar
I pull up in the Lamborghini, tap the gas and disappear
I talk shit like Ricky Flaire, you talk shit not backin’ up
My goons come from my crazy house and all I do is strap’em up
Appointed you, they clap you up and we live lives with thears up
Lookin’ at my neck and wrist thing that cost a kill or two
How the fuck should make a keysha staced at a care or two
Ronnie and Johanna to a lime dime of gin or two
I’m in the zone like 3 on 2, my flo be on supersquirt
My money should kill talk, you better be super sharp
In the pandomera, they don’t know this is coover short
All the fuckin’ ballin’ bitches thinking that I roof the shore
Swish, kept in rollin’, I be prolly with your bitch
Think you know me, I be prolly in the mix
Like cheeks to these presses and some chips
I’m gone! Swag! Hah!

[Verse 3: J Doe]
Uh, now I control the streets no remote
And you see me gettin’ more blessed since them teevo
The women hit me up everyday the same queue
My Facebook friend request it’s going through the roof
And I’m just tryna keep up
I’m firestein, never been second
My swag so sharp I can use it as a weapon
Baby you to fine right here, come meet somebody better
You know that time is money and he can’t buy you a second
Meanwhile my bank account is climbing
Now it’s landing on an island
Got a hundred thousand problems and cup with sharpest bottom
And my sweeter happened to meet up on the beach
She whispered in my hear her heart goes for streets
She said she like my belt wich’s matchin’ with my shirt
Wich’s matchin’ with my shoes so she decided to flirt
My style got her higher than the somking on the purp
Now in it with a shift enough to liften up her skirt
You know I make ‘em…
