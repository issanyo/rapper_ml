[Intro: Meek Mill]
I tell 'em meet me in the bathroom
I fuck her while the water running
Her friend knocking at the door
And she screaming out "I'M CUMMIN!"
I tell em meet me in the bathroom
I fuck her while the water running
Her friend knocking at the door
And she screaming

[DJ Drama]
House party, I'ma play the DJ Martin Lawrence
You know I’m always there forever, man
Those guys, Kid and Play

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I tell em meet me in the bathroom
I fuck her while the water running
Her friend knocking at the door
And she screaming out "I'M CUMMIN!"
And my yungin in my other room, fucking up my sheets
She tell em boy don't grab my hair because you’re fucking up my weave
I got a hundred bottles, Ciroc Boy
All my jewelry cold as fuck but I'm a hot boy
All these stones in my chain make me a rock boy
And I heard you niggas talking money you should stop boy
I fuck bitches by the group I get money by the pound
French Montana on all these niggas ch-ch-ch-ch-chop em down
Every time I’m in the club these niggas is not around
Everybody talking money I say prove it not a sound
White girls, gone wild
We don't judge 'em though, they ain't on trial
Bad bitches got em on dial
It's bottoms up but is going down

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Ciroc all on my table bitches in the living room
They gon ask who at the door, tryna get in too
Only me and my niggas, tell her bring a friend or two
Bottles poppin', models watchin' all in my living room
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
Meet us at the Bunny Ranch, you know where the honeys camp

ATL Lou Will ville
Tryna to show 'em how my nigga Louis will feel

You got a car ride in a Benz man its the real deal
We in the movie room, we ain't watching movies, though
Lights, camera, action, we gon' make a movie, ho
She looking all at my wrist, she love how this Muller glow
Packhouse is hot as shit, she tell me that I'm cooler though
Cooler than a fan, fresh like its Easter
Homie I don't even want your bitch, you can keep her
She say I ain't hit that, only you believe her
Pull off in the Lambo I'm like hasta la vista

[Chorus: Meek Mill]

Bottles poppin', models watchin' all in my living room
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
Welcome to my house party, party
