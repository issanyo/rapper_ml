[Intro: Meek Mill]
Ya, you thought I was gon' be down forever
I told you, I'm back

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Ya I was fucked up but bitch I'm back
I wasn't at the club hoe cause I was in the trap
I see you show me love you ain't like when I was down
Now I'm stunting on them hoes ya how you like me now
Bitch how you like me now
I said how you like me now
But I be shining like a diamond
I got money in my pocket
I don't even ask the price I see it like it I'mma cop it
Ya I was fucked up but bitch I'm back
I wasn't at the club hoe cause I was in the trap
I see you show me love you ain't like when I was down
Now I'm stunting on these hoes ya how you like me now
Bitch how you like me now

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Black Pradas rock with public purple label shit
Make them hoes stop and stare cause I be in the latest shit
Diamonds looking flavorish cause I'm just on some major shit
My swagger on a hundred thousand million like I'm Madoff rich
Why you throwing shade at me hater I could take a bitch
Gucci Louis all of that I got another make a bitch
I be on some player but y'all be on some hater shit
They praying on my downfall make a wish make a wish
Same little bitches wouldn't look my way
Want to suck my dick and I be like ok
But I don't love 'em I don't cuff 'em I just fuck 'em then it's fuck 'em
Do them bitches dirty never think not nothing of 'em
They used to try to play
You'll think I'm Weezy they call me fucking baby
Now I'm on the daily getting at this money like MOB
These hoe can't get not nothing from me

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Ya I was fucked up but bitch I'm back
I wasn't at the club hoe cause I was in the trap
I see you show me love you ain't like when I was down
Now I'm stunting on them hoes ya how you like me now
Bitch how you like me now
I said how you like me now
But I be shining like a diamond
I got money in my pocket
I don't even ask the price I see it like it I'mma cop it
I was fucked up but bitch I'm back
I wasn't at the club hoe cause I was in the trap
I see you show me love you ain't like when I was down
Now I'm stunting on these hoes ya how you like me now
Bitch how you like me now

[Verse 2: Oschino]
How you like me now bitch kerosene heater hot
Two seater drop, icey icey as a freeze pop
Call me now, need notm I'm out Vegas shooting dice
MGM Grand front row prize fight
Party like a rockstar, sexy in my fur coat
Ya I got the guap fucking the bread like burnt toast
Now you want some money from me
You can't get nothing from me
You call me bummy ugly
Shitting on you like a hugging
Now you see me blowing like a pipe bomb hoe
Know you want to come and kick it tae-kwan-doe no
[?] leave alone, screaming through my speaker phone
Inviting me to dinner ya right you better eat alone
Stuntin' like a stunt man ya boy ain't got to worry
His bank account stuffed like Thanksgiving turkey
Can't talk I'm in  a hurry my pl-plane gon' depart
I'm a push push driver you a bus like Rosa Parks

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Ya I was fucked up but bitch I'm back
I wasn't at the club hoe cause I was in the trap
I see you show me love you ain't like when I was down
Now I'm stunting on them hoes ya how you like me now
Bitch how you like me now
