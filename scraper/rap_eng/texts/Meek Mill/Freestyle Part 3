[Verse 1: Lil' Snupe]
Meek put me in a battle, quick 10 g's

Young nigga getting money and that's real shit
And this really shit just happen nigga real quick

And that nigga got that super map my niggas in a super trap

All in the studio I'm tryna fuckin' get my life right nigga
And make sure my circle be tight nigga
I be getting sleepy on them fuckin' flights nigga
But I gotta make sure my mama got on the lights nigga
And make that my people good for life nigga
I know my daddy sittin' in that cell going crazy
Thinking about Lil' Snupe like his life amazing
And he don't even owe me
That's my daddy but he don't really even know me
Shit really thowed, I grew up kinda young
I didn't go to school but I ain't grew up kinda dumb
See I learn from the streets what niggas rack up to beast
And niggas get in some beef
And a lot of niggas get deceased
And a lot of niggas be bitches it's thowed
A lot of niggas really hoes in men clothes
I seen it with my eyes
I seen niggas say that they gon' ride
But them be them niggas who don't survive
I seen niggas go up to the court room tell everythang
But claim in the streets that them the niggas that bang
But when they get out after 10 fuckin' years
Man they try to fuckin' hang, like a lot of shit done changed
You a rat before you a rat now
If you was a mac before then you mac now
If you a pussy then you a pussy now nigga
And if you a pussy then, then you can't get down nigga
See they say 'Snupe you grew up, you grew up without a father
But I see now that shit really just made you grind harder'
My mama use to pray for me every night I was sitting in that cell, going straight to hell
Man I said I gotta get my flow
Remember sitting in my cell my mama on the phone
She sayin' "The devil got you boy"
I said "Yeah I know and I gotta let em go
Just keep praying for me and just pray that I get some hope"
And it's crazy man I gotta it right
15 years old I was looking at juvenile life
21, I ain't coming home for a long time
And my bitches steady writing but that ain't a long time
After a couple months bitches stop writing nigga
And a lot of nigga start phone, I started fighting nigga
So I got out the people said "How?"
And then all them niggas just started wanting to get down
And they see my coming up now
