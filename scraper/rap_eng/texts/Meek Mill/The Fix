[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
We making movies bitch, go get ya popcorn
I was selling butter way before I got an arm
Mac eleven with a ladder in the top draw
Staring at my chain and get ya watch gone
Feeling like Tony, straight back from MIA
[?] murder any rapper in my way
No pics, leave em MIA
[?] said I [?] down in MIA
Rawer than a brick, harder than the cook
Party where the law at, ya niggas shook
Betta tuck ya chain homie before ya get it took
We shooting the film, shoulda did a book
Cause I re-threw ya niggas
Ya ass soft as glass, see through ya niggas
My goons ready to shoot, I'm like be cool ya niggas
[?] small money to remove ya niggas
Lookin' at my Rolly it's about that time
Time to get that money know I'm on my grind
Omelly in the kitchen bout to drop that nine
I got no love for niggas that drop that dime
I'm in the mitt, jump up out the hood to the sticks
[?] passager like Meagan Good in a whip
Riding in the trenches with the wolfs and the pit
On the way to see my OG, he good with the brick
North Philly nigga, Bird street exactly
Wrist should tell you how I'm feeling, you ain't gotta ask me
That's cold as fuck, we be rolling up
Windows smoked out, shooters loading up
Nigga rep ya set, go head throw it up
Time bomb on you niggas cause I'm blowing up
Nine-eleven, July the fourth
Flaming on these niggas, cause I got the touch
