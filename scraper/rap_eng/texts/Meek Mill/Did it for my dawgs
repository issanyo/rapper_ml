I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
Hundred in the mula got more diamonds than a jeweler
Top down on the car, might be riding with a shooter
Nigga down to do ya, I ain't fucking with a curl bar
Nickle plated ruger have you in a box on Worldstar
Duck nigga, duck nigga, duck nigga
Duck nigga where I’m from you call the fuck nigga
Pistol in the freezer, spend a kilo on the visa
Court side Sportscenter, I can make you a believer
Everybody going broke, keep it real, you gotta fight it
Hundred kilo’s in the beemer, boy don’t make me get excited
Couple milli on the neck like I’m tryna get indicted
Got a mansion, got a yacht, bad bitch and a tiger
Real niggas, taking over televisions
Dope boys riding in a new set of Benzes
Hot boy, Young boy, still on fire
What’s a death sentence 'cause we all gotta die
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
Sittin' on them M’s, now shit is gettin' realer
Brick of diesel got my hood looking like it's Thrilla'
Buying all these foreign's, I be in and out the dealer
Just to let my niggas hold on when they rollin', it could kill 'em
And these suckas, I don’t feel 'em
I don’t even see 'em
I’m a die fly, rest in Peace Aaliyah
Half my dawgz dead, the rest of them is here
If all your jewels fake, how the fuck we gon' believe ya
Said I did it for my dawgz, did it for my dawgz
Everybody ridin' till you sit 'em in the morgue
Started with a Bonnie now I’m sittin' in a Porsche
With the shooters right behind me
Shit, you looking at a boss
Rose gold rolie on my wrist, flawless
Hundred bottles send 'em to the VIP, ballin’
Basketball leather in the Benz, Spalding
Y'all niggas talking, fuck is y'all retarded?
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
Oh Lord!
I did it for my dawgz
Did it for them niggas with a vision like a boss
Did it for them niggas in the kitchen with the salt
Now I’m in that white thing, 500 horses for my niggas in the coffin
But got bikes in my hand and a drop head Rolly
Staring at the ceiling when I wake up in the morning
My dawg doing life, try to see him ‘fore he hit the coffin’
Play with my paper, run up in your offices
It’s the 'o twelve Ice Cube nigga with the Raider hat
A maniac nigga, where the paper at
Highway to life, need a hundred mill exit
50 on the wrist, hundred on the necklace, Montana!
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz (I did it for my dawgz)
I did it for my dawgz
Oh Lord!
Yo, watch who you drinking with
Watch who you smoking with
1.7 in my safe when I open it
If I put 7 in ya face, will I open it
And I know tomorrow ain't promised but I hope it is
Love to get acquainted with you
Stay and tear the jail up
Did it for my dawgz so I had to put the bails up
Get them thangs off so I haven’t put the scales up
Treat you like a pit, get ya ears and ya tail cut
Choppas still hot, you can hold it for yourself
Versace, same buckle on the loafers and the belt
Yeah the pills is flying but the smokers is something else
If the spot catch fire, the coke will just really melt
The dough got 'em bringing in the broads
Obvious the flow got 'em screaming for the lord
If there’s money on ya head what you think is the reward?
I ain't do it for myself, you know who I did it for?
I did it for my dawgz
Oh Lord!
