[Intro: DJ Drama]
You know, fuck what you heard
When it comes to this rap shit
Philly, we breed the best
Check the resume

[Hook: Will Smith]
Philadelphia born and raised(x3)
Follow me, Iâ€™m from Philly where they eat cheese steaks
Philadelphia born and raised(x3)
This is Philly you welcome to come check us

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
South Philly where they made me
But North Philly where they raised me
May 6th bottom of the 80's baby
Around the time when he crack hit was crazy
Philadelphia born and raised
North side Burks Street I spent most of my days
Across down 7th Street I bought most of my haze
And from my momma I got most of my ways
She was all I had
Fell in love same streets where I lost my dad
The home of throwbacks and Timberlands but we off of that
Had to step it up like Rocky
Cops locked me couldn't hold me I'm too cocky
I'm from a hood where these kids will hit you
Niggas beefing over cheese like Ishkabibble
Dark nights shots fly so don't stay out there
And you know we balling know we got AI back

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Young Chris]
South Philly south west
West Philly north shit
Feds taking portraits
We ghetto the corporate
Never tap out we don't forfeit
Here's a new casket have a trip to the mortur
Needle on the porches
Trying to make the poor rich
'Til we make the Forbes list
Little men on the horses
Home of the Eagles trapping before the rapping
And the numbers is 10 for the birds Desean Jackson
And the ladies will love fatal attraction
The double G's and the purple labels is matching
Y'all gon' regret it to all the labels that's passing
But fuck y'all cause others labels is asking
From where we [?] we get hot like tha bunny do
Get it and run it Mark Ingram since I was 22
And this for most of my hommies y'all acting funny too
So fuck y'all and for that fucking your honey too

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Freeway]
Bobby Dances, gothams
Club McDonalds
I remember when that nigga B.I.G shut down the armory before they shot him
You Looking for MCs we got them lot of them (x2)
I make the catchphrase early in big bear pay homage
Spray llamas
If someone try to tell you something different that just don't make sense we make dollars
I got to Doctor Denim for the low
Then I slide to King of Prussia for the Louie and the Prada
I'm either out repping Philly on the road
Or on the low getting the chewy and the squatta
We did it all from the movies to the models
Soon as we retire [?]
We roll [?] aluminums and Chargers
Got the big cars in the garages honest

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Black Thought]
I'm from the south side downtown
Section of a loud town
What make us sell out is the only way that we bound down
Black brothers incorporated laid the ground down
I come up on that Lady B and Mimi brown sound
It came at the age of 23rd and Watkins
Without a lot of options
Times was harder than Bernard Hopkins
Young bulls in the yard watching
While the neighbors playing Space Invaders at the corners store clock in
Take a notice to the cussies at the door copping
Now the hustlers in [?] ain't no way to stop it
Philly boys out to make a profit
We Gamble and Huff, and scrambling up to take a pocket
What up [?] you know I got that rocket in the tuck [?]
And you ain't got to like it but you got to give it up [?]
215 stay on the d you better duck [?]
Its south side As-Salamu Alaykum suckas getting stuck you in the
