[Hook: Jeremih]
I got my main bitch, that's probably all I need
Do it on your knees ho
Got my side bitch, she sent from overseas
You ain't got these ho
It ain't nothing, couple hundred on her jeans
You ain't never seen ho
I'm a rich boy stuntin' on them D's
You ain't riding these ho

[Bridge: Meek Mill & Jeremih]
I got a main bitch, I got a side bitch
And my side bitch so bad, ain't gotta hide shit
I got a main bitch, I got a side bitch
And my main bitch the one who I'mma ride with

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Okay we fuck up the city, we hit the town and we dip
You niggas know how we rocking, we thirty rounding the clip
I got a crown on my noggin and got a crown on my wrist
You ever catch me in Philly, I'm rolling around in a six
I'm rolling around with your ho, I know you probably be sick
But if you lay off them bitches, nigga you probably get rich
But if you know me, you know I'm fly as a pilot could get
The plane big as a crib, I got my squad in this bitch
I got my main in this ho, I got my side on this bitch
I'm thirty thou in the air trying to decide what to hit
And I'm the man of the year, she switching side for the clique
She want to be on the scene, she trying to be on the team
Oh Lord!

[Hook: Jeremih]
I got my main bitch, that's probably all I need
Do it on your knees ho
Got my side bitch, she sent from overseas
You ain't got these ho
It ain't nothing, couple hundred on her jeans
You ain't never seen ho
I'm a rich boy stuntin' on them D's
You ain't riding these ho

[Bridge: Meek Mill & Jeremih]
I got a main bitch, I got a side bitch
And my side bitch so bad, ain't gotta hide shit
I got a main bitch, I got a side bitch
And my main bitch the one who I'mma ride with

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Standing on this Wraith, do the Shmoney dance
Rollie on the left, thirty in the other hand
I send my niggas where your mother land
Trying to creep up in you window just like Bruh Man
Where the money? Hundred bands
Fuck nigga, you will never understand
I got bitches overseas popping pussy
Sucking dick and turning up way in Belize, nigga please
Got a main bitch, I got a side bitch
I got a ho I pay monthly just to ride dick
You see my chain glist, that cost me five bricks
Cause I be makin' diamonds flashing, make her eyes twitch

[Hook: Jeremih]
I got my main bitch, that's probably all I need
Do it on your knees ho
Got my side bitch, she sent from overseas
You ain't got these ho
It ain't nothing, couple hundred on her jeans
You ain't never seen ho
I'm a rich boy stuntin' on them D's
You ain't riding these ho

[Bridge: Meek Mill & Jeremih]
I got a main bitch, I got a side bitch
And my side bitch so bad, ain't gotta hide shit
I got a main bitch, I got a side bitch
And my main bitch the one who I'mma ride with
