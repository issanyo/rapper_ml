[Verse 1]
Put in work, put 'em in a hearse
Killed my lil nigga Snupe
Shit I had to put him the dirt, 'fore I put him on a song
Shit I had to put him in a verse
So if you ever see his killer
50 racks on a nigga, put him on a shirt
Headshot, headshot
For 50 G's you better make his bed rock
These niggas talking beef, I'm eating lamb chops
If atleast 20k to eat, y'all Niggas dead-pac, hold up
You starving nigga, like Marvin nigga
I'm on the wood, hold up let me pause that nigga
But I'm talking Garden nigga, watching Melo ball
Why you talking work? You ain't never sell no raw
You ain't never cracked no bird
You was never at no curb
Poppin' wheelies me and A$ap Ty, ray-day down 123rd (like man,man,man,man)
All these hoes fuckin' nigga
If you ain't talkin money it ain't nothin nigga
Where your foreign you ain't stuntin nigga
It's levels to my bitch you can't fuck her nigga
Cause she like Chanel, you couldn't afford her
She got a TL you rockin a Honda Accord bruh
See you the type of niggas my niggas gon send to the store bruh
Won't even let you hit the weed, I know this for sure, bruh
Talk cocky nigga, and y'all can't stop me, nigga
Hundred grand going straight to my jeweler
ASAP make the bezel rocky, nigga
And I ain't talkin bout Rocky, nigga
Hold up, what the beat, drop, my nigga?
Hunnit in this bitch John Brae, John Brae on the watch my nigga
I'm gone off with that money
And if that pussy good, then I eat it
And my bitch bad, talking Michael Jackson
So it's just only right that I beat it
And if them niggas snatch your chain
It's just only right that they keep it
And it's just only right that they rock it
Put it on Worldstar, and make you watch it nigga
And I ain't get my shit snatched yet
[Pause]
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Bad bitch, I hope she bout it
Getting money, you know I got it
100 bands, I don't own no wallet
All y'all niggas be talking shit, talking shit
Talkin jewelry, talks on whips
Where your car? Talk your bitch
Man P'Mon plottin, she might get hit
Cause that's a sniper
