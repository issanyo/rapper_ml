[Verse]
I talk shit like Mayweather cause I know I'm way better
I'm a beast like Della Reese
I'm on a grind all the time I ain't never sleep
I eat Jay-Z  for breakfast Weezy for dinner
I ain't dissing not at all I'm just a starving little nigga
Tryna eat like a hungry Ethiopian
Nigga we be trappin' we got keys like a custodian
Long ass clips with 33s like Nickelodeon
Notice 'em, I put you on the wing like you deodorant
Going in, every verse shittin' on 'em
Hard body [?]
TIP be calling play I run that shit like I'm Clinton Portis
Touchdown on these haters like what now
Aaron Jones to all you rappers we open you shutdown
Its like every time I'm round them shooters be on deck and they ready to gun down
My pockets say ching ching
My neck it say bling bling
Puffin on that Cali bud the same color as string bean
I be up in Hollywood wonder why you ain't seen me
I was in the 57 macking like a 11
High like I'm in heaven can't nobody do it better
Got the multi-colored diamonds looking like a Coogi sweater
See them jack boys looking like they want to jump then let 'em
I ain't never been no pussy bring them choppers to whoever
Drama I'm a problem you ain't tell 'em
I be shitting on these rappers I'm surprised that you ain't smell 'em or inhale them
Spit fire breath ether, creeping through the hood my hoodie on like the reaper
Four pound on me big boy dumb speakers
APC put you on air like you ACG
I probably Nike check a nigga tryna to play with
Matter fact I check a nigga like he ADB
