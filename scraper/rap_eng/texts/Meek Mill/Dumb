[Verse 1: Jazmine Sullivan]
Yo, I know you know you ain't right
Please stop, I know where you was last night
And if you gon' lie, then at least be good
I heard you was in your old hood

[Pre-Chorus: Jazmine Sullivan]
I thought we were past these days
No more games, I believe
So now what I hate the most, is you think you're so smart
You think you're fooling me

[Chorus:]
Oh, you must be
Dumb, dumb, dumb; I ain't
Dumb, dumb, oh baby, you so
Dumb, dumb, dumb; I ain't
Dumb, dumb, no, no, no

[Verse 2: Jazmine Sullivan]
Don't I deserve it all?
You know I take care of you
Whatever you need I'll do
Ungrateful, look how you repay me
Unfaithful, look how you be playin'
With my heart (Oh..)
You have no regard
I swear, if you keep on doing me wrong
You'll look up and I'll be gone

I thought we were past these days
No more games, I believe
So now what I hate the most, is you think you're so smart
You think you're foolin' me

[Chorus]
Oh, you must be
Dumb, dumb, dumb; I ain't
Dumb, dumb, oh baby, you so
Dumb, dumb, dumb; I ain't
Dumb, dumb, no, no, no

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I say, you know I know I ain't right
But I know you know I ain't wife
No other chick but you shawty, I ain't trippin' off you shawty
Heard I'm in my old hood, but I ain't trip when you party
Love hurts and I feel your pain, through all the fame, I still remained
The same nigga, I did, then I came home and I still explained
All this shit you heard about, you gon' let these hoes come steal your lane
Or you gon' let it just die on me, hold it down and come ride for me

[Bridge: Jazmine Sullivan]
Now if my tears don't mean nothing
Don't insult me with lies
And if you won't never change
Please stop wasting my time
Cause if you wanna go out and be single
Go 'head, I told you I won't beg
Cause I know you gon' miss me
So if you leave, baby, you must be

[Chorus]
Oh, you must be
Dumb, dumb, dumb; I ain't
Dumb, dumb, oh baby, you so
Dumb, dumb, dumb; I ain't
Dumb, dumb, no, no, no
