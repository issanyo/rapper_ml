[Intro: Kirko Bangz]
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I'm living, shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
And shawty wanna roll, I’m like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes on my spare time
She don’t fuck on the first night, then she don’t meet my deadline
Niggas smokin that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like Yea Mon
I’m sipping on the whole eighth of the purp shit, bed time
I cop foreigns like Jordans, y'all niggas ain’t important
Shawty want that molly, and I’ma get what she order
Tats all on my body, strapped up like a war
Eat the pussy I prolly, if it smell like water
Her neck talk say fuck me, my wrist talk say suck me
The niggas claiming they balling, I take your bitch Kris Humphries
And make them buy me a whip nigga, nothing less than the 6 nigga
Yall ran your mouth like hoes, all you are some bitch niggas

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
And shawty wanna roll, I’m like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Okay, your baby mama: I bought that, side chick: I bought that
Main chick: I bought that, and your dream girl just called back
I’m still repping that north side with that big P on my ballcap
These broke niggas don’t like me, cause they say I think I’m all that
Now Coon cop that ‘rarri, I don’t even feel salty
Niggas claimin my flows I should put these niggas on Maury
And I ain’t claming these hoes, have these haters looking all sorry
When I pulled up in that Rolls, swag was surfing on ‘em like gnarley
I’m with 3 hoes like Santa Claus, and I’m the boss, Diana Ross
Hit you girl by mistake nigga, wasn’t even in my plan at all
I told homie I hit it there, this nigga wanna be playing it off
Knowing that girl is main thang, that shit don’t like nigga, bang bang!

[Hook: Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs

So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it
