Three passports, three first class
Tickets to the money, straight flights

I live by the code, wardrobe from 'round the globe
All I need is a kilo, an apron, show me the stove
General Electric, perfected, cooking them O's
No more peanut butter sandwiches, now we looking at loaves

Hoes, I need a condom for my toast
Busting in these niggas standing flat footed, I'm on my toes
Froze, pandemonium overdose
Paparazzi in the trees, please, curtains closed

Armadillo cigars, killers who like to play golf
Heroin transactions with Russian shots of the Smirnoff
Playing for keeps, I busting 'em 'fore she get off
I run the city, just pull up and drop the kid off, ha

Welcome to organized crime
Money got me excited, I'm coming four or five times
The '45 for you niggas with 9 lives
Penthouse on college money, long as Ocean drive

Black Chevy Tahoe's, stations up the potholes
My place spacious, smoking aces in Lagos
Feds get involved, I'm slipping off in the synagogue
Issue you your warrant, informant, bitch I've been a boss

Counting money stacks, yours' counterfeited
I made my money back when your accountant didn't
Went against the odds, it's only one Rozay
My nigga okay

I got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk
Started in the back, now we the niggas in the front
Step out on the block, all the bitches they still in shock
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop

Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
Half a million for the same car we rolling in
Pandemonium, pandemonium
We the number 1 niggas, your bitch notice it

Million ways to make this money, you gon' get it
On the grind 24/7 I'm with it
YSL swagger, wrist wear frigid
Jumping out the Phantom like a motherfucking midget

Money knocking at the front door, I'm like, who is it?
It's Benjy, tell my lil nigga, go and get it
Cause I've been counting all this dirty paper for a minute
Lamborghini dreaming thinking how I'm gon' spend it

I'm like one's for the money, two's for the show of it
Three's for the bitches that be fucking for the hoe of it
Four for my niggas that be stacking and then blowing it
You would think I had a curfew the way I'm going in

Look at what we rolling in, causing pandemonium
Papi got them keys in, he like my custodian
I was trying to bag a brick, you was Nickelodeon
I was in them trenches, getting down and dirty serving it

We's part of the reason that them churches got some services
The morgue could afford just cause we was doing murdering
Nigga called my phone, talking reckless, I ain't heard of it
Fuck ya girl, give her back, I'm courteous

I can keep a secret with Vicky, have a menage with Nicki
And be out London with Lauren and telling Meagan good morning
Catch me rolling with Kelly or at the Hilton
With Paris from Hollywood to the hood

I want a mom and I swear that I want 'em all, wanna fuck 'em all
Had my niggas down so I'm screaming fuck the law
Monday night wrestling, I'm so fucking Raw
She gon' wipe me down, I'm gon' brush her off

I'm way harder than the concrete, I say what my mind speak
Word to the homies Ross, I can get that 9 Piece
For the low that 9 cheap, call me if you want it
Haters see me and I'm staying got 'em sick to they stomach

I got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk
Started in the back, now we the niggas in the front
Step out on the block, all the bitches they still in shock
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop

Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
Half a million for the same car we rolling in
Pandemonium, pandemonium
We the number one niggas, your bitch notice it

Whole time, see that fly shit I've been on
All the girlfriends fall in line from my spin off
That's game bitch ain't shit, nudies and some J six
Where I'm from, it's cold and niggas get at you like handkerchiefs

God bless you unless you was disrespectful
Bitches disappoint you but money won't ever stress you
They say I'm special as Devin Hester on fourth down
So all that shit you niggas kicking with worried about

Catch me at the carry out, mumbo sauce and half and half
Flyest niggas out here, period no maxi-pad, bitch I got a right to brag
Bitch, I got a right to boast
Presidential suite and bitch and I never use my right to vote

My vision enormous, my bitches is gorgeous
And I am dead serious, bitch, I spit with embalming
Shout out to lil G, shout out Tre and Mohammad
That BOA shit we get paid with death over dishonor

I'm known as Obama's don't, I know no one in Congress
These bitches love me all the way, you got sort of's and kind of's
Sort of remind you, why you don't call no vagina
Just give 'em awesome intercourse and ignore there inquires

Quietly becoming a top ten, you dreamed of getting cream
Best believe I'm John Deere, Smith, greenist Moncler shit
Earth tones in the winter, Purp rolled in a rillo
I am on my John Lithgow

Out of this 3rd Rock, nigga it out
I am on my Tom Brady, y'all niggas is Eric Crouch
What the blood clot, Tommy Frazier, fuck yourself
I can see your album coming, that shit's like a sucker punch

Here for breakfast, fuck for lunch
Dinner time she bring a friend, write my shit so vicious
Y'all are like snitches you can't see the pen
Always on some new shit CNN, shitting on these niggas like I need a pen

I got a penny in my pocket, million in the trunk
Started in the back, now we the niggas in the front
Step out on the block, all the bitches they still in shock
Get a piece of pussy then take my niggas to shop

Pandemonium, causing pandemonium
Half a million for the same car we rolling in
Pandemonium, pandemonium
We the number 1 niggas, your bitch notice it
