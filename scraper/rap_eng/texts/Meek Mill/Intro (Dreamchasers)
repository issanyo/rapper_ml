[Intro: DJ Drama]
You see
We dream chase cause that's all we was given to start with
Then we realized the dream was obtainable
Now look at us

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Counting money all I seem to hear is Benji talking
Hater we ain't conversatin' it's just semis talking
Used to be the boy
They said they have a penny on 'em
Now I walk around with twenty chains with like a milli on em
Lace up my boots, put on my strap
And go lookin' for that paper I'm like "where it's at?"
They lookin' at, I'm staring back (I see you)
Feelin' like I'm superman
Every time I wear this mac
Monday, it's probably 106 & park
Tuesday, probably in the hood where it get dark
Wednesday, Probably catch me swimming with the sharks
With blood dripping from my shoes, these Loub's cooler than my heart

[Break: DJ Drama]
See dream chasing is an occupation
Those with the job understand the process of manifestation
Your dream starts as a thought
Then its nurtured, achieved, and sustained
Then we go back into our minds for more

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Let me out my cell, right back on the mission
Fresh from off a bail, right back in the kitchen
Who the fuck gon' pay my lawyer
I got booked with this Sig Sawyer
And like eighty grams of crack
He said the feds probably come for ya
I'm like "oh lord!"
Copper said I tried to kill em when I go to court
I hope they dont find me guilty, it's my word against they word
And I won't get a chance to speak
I caught my case with nine of my niggas, and I'm the only one they beat
I took it for the team
Even though I had a dream like Martin Luther King
Who thought that I'd be cover of these magazines
Cause I be spitting fire flow, I'm kerosene
Lemme talk to em
Fuck y'all niggas gon' say about me?
My North niggas they don't play about me
South Philly niggas that'll spray about me
Pay q million dollar bail in a day about me
Ain't gotta sound real, cause they'll tell you that
I'm on the top floor, I started where the cellar at
Self Made, bitches

[Outro: DJ Drama]
I had a dream one time
It was, I was gonna make a lotta money doing what I wanted to do
I went after it and it was a struggle to achieve
But you know what?
I caught that bitch!
Dreamchasers!
This is where dreams become reality
