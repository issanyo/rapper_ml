[Verse 1: J Sutta]
You make me feel high when I feel low
Take away my pain, make it no more
Make me feel good all over
Take over my body if you want to
You can change my life if I let you
Things ain't the same when I miss you
I go out of my way just to have you
Put it all on the line if I have to

[Chorus: J Sutta]
Cause I, I, I love this feeling you give to me
And I, I, I want this feeling forever
Cause I, I, I love this feeling you give to me
And I, I, I want this feeling forever
I want this feeling forever

[Post-Chorus: Instrumental]
I want this feeling forever
I want this feeling forever

[Verse 2: J Sutta]
I love this feeling
I probably won't sleep until tomorrow evening
Fucking with you would be bad for my health
You make me happy when I'm out of breath
And I know, I should probably leave you
But I always run back cause I really need you
And if I lost it all, I'mma lose it, I love the way you do me

[Chorus: J Sutta]
Cause I, I, I love this feeling you give to me
And I, I, I want this feeling forever
Cause I, I, I love this feeling you give to me
And I, I, I want this feeling forever
I want this feeling forever

[Post-Chorus: Instrumental]
I want this feeling forever
I want this feeling forever

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Okay I’m balling like the heat
Thousand dollar sneaks
Luis Vuitton spikes on him like a pair of cleats
I don’t check for hoes let ‘em check for me
In this black and white Ferrari
Blow the whistle referee
Tongues out cause I ball though
Suicide door flow
Got these hoes checking for me
You can call me Waldo
Probably in the car though
Bussing like a Marlo
Cause every time I pull up on you niggas it’s a car show 

[Chorus: J Sutta]
Cause I, I, I love this feeling you give to me
And I, I, I want this feeling forever
Cause I, I, I love this feeling you give to me
And I, I, I want this feeling forever
I want this feeling forever

[Post-Chorus: Instrumental]
I want this feeling forever
I want this feeling forever

[Outro: J Sutta]
(I want this feeling forever)
You make me feel high
You make me feel high
You make me feel high
You make me feel high
I want this feeling forever
You make me feel high
You make me feel high
You make me feel high
You make me feel high
I want this feeling forever
