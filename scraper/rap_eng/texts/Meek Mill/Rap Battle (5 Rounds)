Play this whenever you wanna play this
Call me George Bush cause I'm blowin' up when I'm with my clique
And I'm with my clique Jackpot nigga

[Lil Snupe]

Growin' up I watched all of my friends shake
Even my family members treated me like a inmate
Momma had me at 16, and I'm from a small city but I got some big dreams
Daddy left me as a youngin', jail was his location so I had no motivation
But I was still dedicated, can't nobody stop my shine
I'm like the sun number 1, momma smile just to see what I've become
I'm a young man wit' a big dream, tryna make it out the projects rich
So you know I stay on that paper route, people don't want me to make it, tryna take me out
So I pray daily askin' God for the safer route
Used to go to Tom house when I ain't had no where to eat
Go to D-Lo house when I ain't had no where to sleep
Cause my momma couldn't take it, she just gave up on me
I couldn't do nothing right, seem like bad luck was me
And I was raised so illegal, the baddest nigga in the neighborhood talkin' back to Denesha
At my house it was real cold, and lonely. My daddy been gone since 4
Money money money money all that I really seen
Niggas out here sellin' tabs, sellin' bars, sellin' green
Jonesboro, Louisiana goons on that dumb shit
Just because you got that chain nigga you don't run shit
I show you how we do it, this nigga he be kickin' it with some childish hoes
We finna go to Hawaii get on some gallagins, alii hoes
What happens behind the does(doors), shid nobody knows
Make ya bitch gotta get out her clothes and she gone blow me like a snotty nose

[Round 3: Lil Snupe]

Vick you cold but you really needa get rid of this nigga
Man this nigga fuckin' pooh! You know just how we do
That's why y'all can't win and that's really comin' from Snupe
See this nigga fuckin' garbage, niggas know that I'm the hardest
I swear I'm the hardest that ever recorded
See me I do my thang, I'm in my own lane
If your money so fuckin' long go buy him a new chain
See these niggas know I do this shit, stay out my lane
And what's crazy, nigga this comin' from my brain
See you I eat you up like a souffl√©, niggas know that i hooray

What the fuck wrong witchu boy
Real shit, yeah I'm 'bout a disaster
You could get eat nigga aids don't even matter
See I'm from Louisiana, where it's just straight hellC
Jonesboro, Louisiana the city where the Lord dwells
See all my niggas thuggin' all my niggas in a cell
And if you fuck with me wrong you going to heaven or hell

[Retro]

Goons that'll murder when the kid say sick 'em
I take my women shoppin', I tell my ladies pick one
And I bet you they love me when I pull up in that Phantom
Yup I pull up in that ghost, no but I ain't Danny Phantom
Uh throw a couple hundreds can you make that change
Know the kid's style like a lego game
I be gettin' money with the same ol' game
You the same ol' lame with the same ol' change uhh
This here ain't my scene so baby leggo
Only with me cause I'm at the top like a falsetto
Why these lames hatin' am I really that hot
Do they women really love me cause I'm gettin' that guap
Got the city on lock, got the city on fire
And I am the fresh prince nigga
Bow to your highness

[Round 4: Retro]

Keep a rollie on so they call me Rollie Retch
Rolls Royce ridin' make them niggas hold they breath *breathes*
Throwin' money, you just showin' money
I got that ho, drop it low, and bust it open money
Cause we throwin' Lou, women all in they birthday suit
If Jackpot your favorite crew then pop that like Uncle Luke
I said Lord have mercy, I like my women naked or undressin'
I'm about to give the game a C-section
Philadel, hold in down, These hoes screamin' like James Brown
These niggas dressed like Mr. Brown and whipped top bald like Mr. Brown
And I'm coolin. My niggas from the west like Alonte
Sexy women look similar to Beyonce
And we poppin', be honest, who you know be honest
Your money thin as an eye lid and we mob shit like Italian

[Lil Snupe]

Mane these niggas can't fuck with me
Yeah they know wassup with me
They know I'm finna blow that's why they always discussin' me
A broke bummy nigga that's something I ain't grow up to be
I grew up to get money and all the kids look up to me
Walkin' down a dark road, it's hard to get some fuckin' light
In my hood it's fuckin' wrong, it's hard to get some fuckin' right
Only thang guaranteed out my hood is fuckin' life
Judge and the D.A melt your dream like some fuckin' ice
Me I'm just a sinner, really a beginner
A hood nigga tryna turn into a grammy award winner
I'm eatin' you see shit on my plate when it's time for dinner
I really rap what I live, you a fuckin' pretender
My lil brother look at me, and he know it's own
Before I go to school he up jammin' my song
It's crazy cause I'm lookin' at him and he gettin' grown
The pain that we done went through, I just be getting stoned
Was never taught right from wrong
Was always taught if you wanna go get it then go get it even if it's with your chrome
If you a hustla' and you broke then why you going home
Even if you gotta get out here and grind all alone
But me, I'm chasin' a dream, tryna make sure that my family straight
But it seem like I can't get right even since my granny way
People don't know what I seen when I looked in my granny face
But I don't trip cause I know she in a better place
I grew up in the projects with just one room
So I had to sleep on the floor in the front room
Me and all my cousins on the block tryna thug
Nigga you a school boy nigga we was sellin' drugs
I grew up in Jonesboro it was straight wildin'
I hung out with the older cats so it was straight violence
And the niggas I looked up to was hustlin' or robbin'
So I hopped off the porch too and started gettin' it poppin'
I started with a half of dollar 'til I got the whole thang
On the freeway to the millions but I'm in my own lane
Niggas worried 'bout a bitch, I'm worried 'bout stackin' change
I'd probably rob him but I don't even want that fuckin' chain
I wake up every morning thinkin' 'bout a dollar
So if you ain't talkin' dollars I ain't tryna holla
My heart cold cause I grew up without a father but it really made me smarter
And made me grind harder
Who'd ever thought I would make my dreams a reality
Own family thought that they was gone have to bury me
Took my momma 9 months just for her to carry me
So I was brought into this world to live like your majesty nigga

[Round 5: Lil Snupe]

When I get that 10 racks nigga we gone hit the mall
And just ball like Kobe and Paul Gasol
These bitches know that I'm thuggin'
These bitches all on my balls
Yo bitch is beggin' me that she can see my Polo drawls
