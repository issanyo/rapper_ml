[Intro]
Let's get it

[Hook]
I got bands (oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bands (oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bands

[Verse 1]
Man, I'm in these streets it's been a long day (bands)
Bout to sign this deal and throw it all away (bands)
Bout to cop the crib that Dame lost today (bands)
Funny, look at them niggas that slipping
You trippin', no fear, my niggas, we get it (bands)
I'm looking down at the whole world through these glass ceilings (bands)
And when I step outside, bad bitches with me (bands)
Back in my section, twisting that la la can't let it stress me (bands)
Wake up, fall asleep to Dizzy Gillespie (bands)
Ba-back it up and break it down (bands)
She gon' bust it on this dick, you gon' take her out of town (bands)
I put ice in my veeners, I put rubies in my crown (bands)
Count them stacks and blow them racks, niggas know who they around

If we take all of these shots, we gon' go berserk (bands)
Shut the fuck up bitch you trippin', really though lately [?] smoke, lots of hoes down to blow (bands)
Vamanos, time to go, we gon' go straight to the workin' now (bands)

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Lately, I been goin' crazy
Laughin', drinkin', find myself in arms of different women, huh
Toast it, I need to use my cerebellum
Tried to tell ‘em cut that rap shit all that wack shit's underwhelming
Time's ticking, palms itching
Mind's tripping, tired of living, mad decisions, I'll kill ‘em

[Bridge]
