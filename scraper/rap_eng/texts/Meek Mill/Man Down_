Hit em up we got a man down
Call a cop we got a man down
They say there no [?] up in that gettel with that metal

Sitting in the casket
Is when I first went to get the ratchet
Shit is real, them white folks itching to do me like Emmett Till
And I can smell death in the air and you the kill
My mommy used to hold the barrettes and it was hot
And the nerve of you niggas say you started from the bottom
When theres real niggas dying, cops killing, metals flying
All that bullshit you selling, real niggas never buy
Fake niggas can't faze me, real niggas never die
Hella fry, I got perks and it's lean to me
I seen these perks turn my homies to a feen to me
If I keep lean on you, you can't lean on me
I'm in them trenches with them things on me
I'm gettin' money, I'm countin' a milli cash
They making memes of me
I'm everything you niggas dream to be
I'm at [??] on the top floor
Eatin' hell's chicken with the hot sauce
I can get you faded, get you knocked off, dropped off
Middle of the city, make an example of niggas
Talkin [??] , lit candles for niggas
You don't wanna see my dawg with his hand on the trigger
R.I.P.   and [??]    my niggas

[Chorus]
Leanin' out the window, Aimin' that extendo
And when that [??] ran, you momma feel the pain
Keep em waitin for
