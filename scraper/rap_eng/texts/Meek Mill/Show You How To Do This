[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I show you how to do this youngin
How you want it my sneaks is nine hundred
These ain't Gucci baby these is the Louis
In the kitchen with the white it smell like blue cheese
We get that paper by the loose leaf
Trying to cop a Maybach you still buying Lucy's
Different page with the flow
I don't even got a chop I be playing with the flow
Like, how y'all suckas gon' hate on me
Know half y'all sucka done ate off me
Like gon' fuck around with the eight on me
You want to make it fall like 803
308, motivation I feed off hate
Want to talk money nigga we all straight
Everybody good nigga we all ate, we all ate
[?] twist it back
Two hands we get high no kickback
Young boy head shot get your shit cracked
Hot shit, break you off like Kit-Kat
Trying to [?] worrying about when TIP back
Oh shit I forgot I done spit that
Late night you was worrying where your chick at
Blame it on me 'round time when I hit that
Stupid chick even [?] where the kids at
I was inside screwing around where the bricks at
Pull up in the drop, hater how you get that
I make them even madder when I switch that
Neck cold wrist froze like a six pack
Hot shit brick it back like click clack
[?] to get back
Looking for new shit nigga this that

[Verse 2: Ms. Jade]
Just put a little in the baggie
And a little in the purse
And my right back pocket
And the bra under my shirt
I don't look at it [?]
That's money I deserve
Excuse me sir, that's money that I earned
Watch face blue Smurf
Judy Jetson out this fucking world the future, its her
No I don't mean to mean no harm
But my drive keep me driven, drive many many cars
And they R's
And my bars still tight leotards
Rest in peace shout out to [?]
Yes yes yo
Cooler than an Autumn breeze
Pockets got the mumps
[?] look at me, look at me
Fresher than I ever been
Ms. Jade's back tell a friend to tell a friend
Sipping on [?]
Cockier than I was before
Treat her like [?]
Then drop her like Rocky IV
Nah, don't talk about it be about it
On the roads to the riches I'mma [?] about it

Get in quick then get up out it

[Verse 3: Black Dinero]
Aye I show you how to do this hommie

So you better keep that in mind when you try to bring it to black
I got money power respect

I got niggas on my team that's fighting multiple homicides
And you DVD killing niggas be scared to come outside
