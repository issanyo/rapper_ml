[Intro: Meek Mill]
For all my real niggas
For all my niggas that ain't here
For all my niggas that's down right now

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
To get this change another chain nigga
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
Never rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
When I cry, I cry real tears
For all my niggas that died wish I could back years
And bring them back here
For all my niggas locked and got life years
I'm on my grind all the time this the last year
We gon' starve flea on dog
There's no limit to what I do, I'm Master P on guard
For that relish green like the Celtics nigga we ball hard
On the block running that rock like a b ball yard
I ain't trying to be the hottest I'm trying to get my mind straight
Tweety school private, a million dollar bank account
Cruising on the island, tricking bitches
Reminiscing how we used to wild 'em
Play the game foulin'
The water ain't deep 'til you swimming with piranhas
With blood trailing from you and they swimming right behind you
The hood no good everybody think they riding
Until you catch them slipping put some shit up in they noggin
They rather see you shot up before they see you pop up
The chain around your neck all fresh pulling that drop up
I came around the set nothing less where niggas cop up
So I had no choice but to grind and get this guap up
Ever since a boy just my moms and my poppa
The streets been the old head they raised me as a rider
I don't really fuck with rap I do it cause I got to
I do it for my fans and for my mans for the dollars

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
To get this change another chain nigga
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
Never rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga

[Verse 2: ]
I know I bring you pain same time bring you joy
Through all the shit we've been through you know I'm still your boy
You know I'mma ride we still got each other
Taking care of lil' brother you my one and only mother
Look we ain't doing bad in fact we doing good
I'mma make it with this rap we gon' make it out the hood
Put his hands on you I wish a nigga would
Coming through strapped up black mac black hood
Was locked down for a minute I wasn't gone long
I left you a little [?] I know I was wrong
You wrote me back to back letters told me stay strong
I had rainy days you was with me through the storm
That's why I show you love dry your eyes give me hugs
Nineteen years strong I ain't go without the grub
You and my pop had up and downs
Even though y'all separated everyday you used to come around
That's why I love you mom, and I love you dad
Your little soldier gon' go far with this pen and pad
I know I'm sinning bad but ain't nobody perfect
If being broke ain't a joke ain't nobody smirking
I know I pushed my little dime down time to time
But I'm stuck in the hood fuck it I got to grind
Its gon' be real when I sign the line
Cause I'mma get you paradise my little ain't have to grind
Cause I'm going to to do it for him I know he watching me
They way I living hell Lil' [?] couldn't tell
I give him what he want make him think its all well
But he don't see that razor and that work up on that scale
Winter time grind with the woolrich and the Taurus
Its [?] but you know you got to take them orders
You got to move them quarters that's how you get them o's
Got to crawl before you walk that's just how the game goes

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
To get this change another chain nigga
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
Never rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I remember days being dead broke
I got so motherfucking hungry man my head hurt
I had to get myself together make my head work
Man at the same time keep my rap career first
But everybody know the hood can be the worst distraction
And when a nigga disrespect you gun's your first reaction
That's how we living in the struggle all we got is pride
So when a nigga take it from you shit you got to ride
Murder homicide
So by all means necessary I'mma strive
To get my momma out the hood since my father died
If you don't you don't shine shit I got to try
A made man a brave man nigga I am I
You keep your faith in money I keep mine in God
And the only thing that's funny watch as I survive
On the road to the riches
Me and my niggas counting dough
Fucking these hoes getting digits let's go

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Now this one is for my trill niggas
On the block, moving that rock, ducking cops all my real niggas
To get this change another chain nigga
On the block, moving them things, switching lanes on them lame niggas
And this one is for my young niggas
On the block, busting them shots, ducking cops don't be dumb niggas
Just bring your all and get these ones niggas
Never rat, never fold, niggas approach you bust your gun nigga

[Outro: Meek Mill]
You feel me, real niggas do real thing
I hold down my set nigga I fuck with real niggas
We next up nigga
Get this money nigga
Go get this Bloodhoundz nigga
I let you fuck them boys
I'm Meek holla at your fucking boy
