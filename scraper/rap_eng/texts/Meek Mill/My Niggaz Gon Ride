I said my niggas gon ride if there’s drama about me
It ain’t about a murder than it ain’t about no beef
Cause all we know is homicide, nigga I’m a G
And if them pussys looking for me they can find me in the street

[Verse 1]
I said my niggas gon ride if there’s drama about me
I told em “line up boys and put the ladders in the street”
And it gon be a homicide, somebody got to bleed
That chopper hit him 20 times, put that boy up on a tee
Now RIP, last nigga that played got his pussy ass sprayed
Now he stiffer than a stone, bones chilling in the grave
Hey, I’m lighting Philly when I blaze
Bullets smack him in his head, had blood dripping through his waist
I’m a North sider rapper, South sider rider
My niggas move for me, but ain’t nothing like my chopper
Where they at? Right there, pull up when we spot em
See them niggas running, if he trip I know I got him
I’m riding for my niggas that’s down for me
And when I die, nigga don’t cry, just bust your pound for me
Yea, like open bar boy, you give em round for free
If they ain’t riding, get em round for me

[Hook][x2]

[Verse 2]
I’m like, same niggas used to be speaking, now they grilling
Osama asked me what it’s hitting for, I’m like kill em
Fuck em, shoot em in they face, make em suffer
We smoke em, then we joke about them pussy motherfuckers
Strapped up, I’m never sleeping
I’m on point, and better him than better me
Memory, forever sleep, an enemy, can never be
A threat to me, a stress to me, if he ain’t got the breath to breathe
All we know is murder homicide
Kill him on his doorstep and really make his mama cry
Leave her traumatized, let them holler fly
Rock a baby boy to sleep, that chopper singing lullabies
If it ain’t about a murder I ain’t heard of it
We don’t do the hospitals, we do funeral services
And gymnastics get a nigga’s casket dirty
In other words we laying niggas out, you heard me
