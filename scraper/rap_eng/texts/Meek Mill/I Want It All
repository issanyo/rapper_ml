(Verse 1: Lou Williams)
I must be Maserati dreamin', I can't sleep at night
I wake up, I say my prayers. Thank god I live my life
I'm in a GranTurismo 2 tone
Passenger's a red bone
Whoo! She's like the car cause she can't never keep her top on
See here, I was sleeping in class missing the lessons
I was millionaire dreamin'. Fuck passing these tests
My teachers used to say I was lazy and second-guessing
Now I'm laughing at they ass, blowing cash, and countin' blessings
I understood the SATs, yeah, OK, but
What about these million dollars these luxury Benz cuts
Them Escalades on 26's them tires they thin cut
You mean to tell me you'd pass up steak and lobster for school lunch
I made my first mill told moms I was leaving home
Then I made 30 more god damn I was puttin' on
I used to dollar menu and spectate at the mall
But now I'm buying that bitch out, cuz shit I want it all

(Hook)
Cause I want it all
I want it all
Yeah I deserve the world cause I hustle hard
Yeah I want it all
I want it all
You know I'm on my grind cause I hustle hard
I'm in it for the money and the cars, the clothes and the hoes
The diamonds on my neck and wrist froze
Cause I want it all
Cause I want it all
Hey

(Verse 2: Meek Mill)
First off where the money at
Cause I go crazy 'bout that paper I'm a money-ac
My hood prefer to walk but I be runnin' that
So far gone you would think I wasn't coming back
South D and George Kush, we ain't smoking none of that
You be puffin on that Reggie Bush (cough cough) running back
You just bought a used car, you think you gon' stunt in that
I just bought a Audemar and my shit it cost double that
Crushing that
Stuntin' is my favorite sport
Eatin' without no playing fork
On the road to riches and I ain't got no plan on taking shorts
Some people will call it greedy I just call it making sure
If I ain't got no food up on my plate then I'll be taking yours
I know what I want, I know what I'm doing
They telling me different, I know where I'm going
Fuck talkin' about it, I'll show 'em I'm doing
Progress in the night and ???

(Hook)

(Verse 3: Meek Mill & Lou Williams)
(Meek Mill)
Mind on my money
Money in my pocket
Thousand Benny Franks
Man you know nothin' 'bout it
That's money in the bank
He selling in my closet, winning no matter what
Losing ain't a option
I said, they ain't see my vision though
All I had to do was break it down like the vision though
They wanted that fake shit, I was on original
They ain't gonna get it for me I'mma go and get it oh
(Lou Williams)
OK a mill ain't shit
And a problem ain't either
Keep a couple of both long as I'm filling up arenas
Philly it's ice cold so punch yo heat keep the heater
Big dawg on his hip, like an old school beeper
I'm barely even legal but I'm 4 cars deep
Three houses to my name my people stealing these streets
The hell with VIP, y'all ain't gotta hide me
I'm on the dance floor shit, Meek he know where I be

(Hook)
