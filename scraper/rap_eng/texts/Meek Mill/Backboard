[Hook: Young Thug]
Hey, 200 miles on the dashboard (skrt-skrt-skrt)
I came from serving them bags out a back-porch
(Serving them bags out a back-porch)
We hit that boy with a stick cause he asked for it
(Hit that boy with a stick)
Residue, I threw that brick off a backboard
(I through that brick off a backboard)
80k on, it's a backend, backend
I hit that lil boy with a Mac-10, Mac-10
I spent like four racks on a jacket, fashion
I fuck that ho with a passion, I'm everlasting

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I am a leader, (boss)
Never a follower (never a follower, whoo)
You a dick eater, your girl's a swallower (she official my nigga)
No I won't hit her, she not in my caliber (wouldn't even hit that thot)
We've been stunting a long time, I know that they tired of us (niggas is sick, woah)
I ain't around no fuck boy
Glock four pound in the tuck boy
Big D's on truck boy (skrt-skrt)
All my young niggas sell boy (young nigga)
Young boy going like Elroy (yeah)
Big booty back in the Goyard (Goyard)
Spend the whole thing in Bergdorf
These niggas sick, need Airborne
Flood my Patek
Young boy still getting at it (at it)
21 shots my FN (brrrr)
Young rich nigga living savage (savage)
You in the hood, gotta check in
We the side never need passes (no)
These fuck boys so swagless, 4500 my jacket, fashion
(Skrt-skrt)

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
Your bitch'll call me Mr. Big
My house a year old like a kid
We murk 'em then we dodge the pigs
Put a dirt bike on your wig
Could be court side with your bitch (skrt)
Could be worldwide, I'm a trend (woah)
Make her snort a line like a pin (snh)
Nigga diamonds jumping out the gym
Take it all off, take it all off with your friends, ay
Play with my dogs, then we going off with your head, yeah
The Percocets on me, a young nigga take a lot of meds
I pop me a thirty now I walk around like I'm dead (dead man walking)
I'm high as the law, I'm lit like July the 4th
Double R seats they tight, but a pussy nigga really soft (soft)
I'ma take off on sight (takeoff), run a nigga down like Moss
I got me a Draco on the flight, I came out the creek like Dawson

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Swerving, swerving, swerving, swerving
Basic bitches make me nervous
I'm so high, ain't got no service
Fuck a fuckboy bitch on purpose
Swerving, swerving, swerving, swerving
Bust a brick down, bag and serve it
We gon' take this shit the furthest
Play with me and shit get murdered (brrp-brrp)
