[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I say, gettin to the money that's all we know
Middle of the drought tryin to move that snow
Get that flip that stack that dough
Side hit that bitch and smack that hoe
Toolie on deck everywhere we go
Fucking every bitch on [?]
I spit that shit got a dappy flow
I fly by hoes like there he go
Ya we trap like its a sport
Ya I shine like armor all, but yet I ball like on the court
Ally-oop a little bitch Omelly slam her for the score
Ya its my time and I'ma shine like I'm a fucking Audemar
Stunt, ball, like its no tomorrow
Fuck your main bitch and probably won't return her call (not at all)
Sucking her and cuffing her like she broke the law
While I'm whipping all these hoe like I'm trying to turn a car
Back to the flow I was killing that shit
Been about a week you still on that brick
North side nigga I'm still on that shit
We all fucking her you feeling that bitch
You still on that bitch
Running through hoes like Reggie bush
We blow that purple jelly baby I don't know how Reggie look

[Interlude: Omelly]
Damn, its all types of charge
On some [?] county type shit
Like if my PO find out that [?] I might go to jail for that shit
Fucking with these bitches man

[Verse 2: Oschino]
Looney Tune, Goony Goon, stepping in my Louie shoes
Your bitch she on dick, give me inside my movie room
Paper paper on my mind, in my coup as I recline
Coming through the block to cop, got it hot as Palestine
Money money half a mil, chase it down like track and field
Me and money Jack and Jill, we together all the time
Up the hill, down the block we got rocks like empty lot
Black and gold Jaguar that shit look like a copper top
Duracell, corner sale, killing shit like [?]
Ya the [?] threw the pussy like the shit your daughter sell
Oschi, Oski, Gold Rollie low key
I ain't got a grind I spend the shit I made in '03
Whole key, half a  [?], feeling like a hammer song
Too legit to quit can't touch this hammer law
Get it in, flip it fast, I be getting killer grabs
Niggas want to see me fall, bike no kick stand
Pocket change, diamond ring, shit look like a hockey rink
Llama sing, loud song, hit that nigga ground ball
Standing tall as John wall
Never snitch, never rat
[?] get right back even if I got to max
Gettin money what I do, VIP let me through
Omelly whole crew gettin' change phone booth, phone booth
