[Intro: Meek Mill]
Stop playin' nigga
It's DC, Double MG

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Boy I swear to god I make her fuck the whole clique
Clique, clique, clique, clique
Sittin' in the back while she sucking on my dick
Dick, dick, dick, dick
Boy I got a hundred cash right here on my wrist
Wrist, wrist, wrist, wrist
Started from the bottom now a nigga getting rich

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I ain’t lookin at your bitchass
I’m looking at your bitch’s ass
I fuck a famous ho and put that dick up in her rich ass
Prolly eat the pussy tell that ho that I don’t kiss ass
And everytime I’m rollin, it’s 200 hundred on the [?]
Deadass, serious, fuck her fast and furious
She tellin' all her homies now, them bitches actin' curious
These niggas catch a lil' case [?]
And when the cops ask 'em, they tell 'em like Siri did
Get it, iPhone, face time
Last night I had your bitch we had a great time
I’m back in philly but I’m still on that LA time
My flow so crazy, check the way I ride the base loud
Hold up nigga I go in, these niggas ain’t got no win
Baddest bitches I be with they lookin like they modelin'
Perks and patron got me stoned like a goblin
Mad rappers making diss records I’m like try again
Please nigga you should take a knee nigga
Before them shots hit your body make you fall e nigga
Like it’s september, thanking my daddy I’m the next Simba
Meek Milly, bitch

[Verse 2: Lee Mazin]
I ain’t lookin' at you bitches, cause I feel none of you bitches
I ain’t checkin' for you niggas, I ain’t worried 'bout you niggas
And my shit be kinda major, like I’m balling for the figures
Got 2 chains around my neck, you could see I do it different
She so bad but she go so ho, shit got real when I got that ball
Too 3d, but you can’t see me
And you can’t stick Lee cause I want it hard
The shit goes swish, and you know I did it for the win
And yeah I killed this check but fuck that shit I’ma do it again
Do it again just to quench they thirst
If you dive in put your face in first
I make 'em lick it, and yeah my girls ball hard like Steve Boss
I make 'em click it
And when I spit that shit they like I turn that pure [?]
And then they see that body, see that ass, that shit ridiculous
Man like fuck lee, I scream right back like fuck you too
If you want the beef first you gotta get through my fucking crew
That’s to y’all lame nasty see
Name one chick who could fuck with me
Hold up, oh wait I say, name on chick who fucking with me
If you talking shit, just be careful what come out your mouth
Aroma something erotic, make your boyfriend pay to smell it out
Or taste it, he put his face in
He like we fuck your government that shit amazing

[Verse 3: Louie V]
Yeah I’m talking me, yeah I’m talking meek
Yeah I’m talking Lee, Lil' Chino and Lil' Snup-e
Murder on every track, preferred Jahlil B
I’m talking bout Rozay too, we reppin with MMG
Cruising through south beach, in a California ferarri
Shine brighter than california, my jewelry it’s extra gaudy
Peep the way I maneuver, she says I’m smooth as a barbie
So she gave me her number, I fucked her after the party
Man I’m living life, I might do that tonight
Met them bottles of rose, the waitress put 'em on ice
Sparkles all in my section man I could give you a light
Man my niggas be stuntin like Chino were born to bike
Yes lord, the dreamchasers
We blowin money fast like we never seen paper
Now I got these new relatives, and everybody callin'
All of a sudden this shit started James Harden
I tell em talk about some money but they ain't talking
But I’ma go and get it 'till they put me in the coffin
It’s funny now that they callin me the shit
Louie V, DC, shit man, and ain’t nobody fuckin with my clique
