(Intro: Meek Mill)
Yeah, Meek Millie
Euroz what up?
Young niggas get money
Dream Chasers nigga
Double M G

(Verse 1: Euroz)
Uh, from my city you know I’m the next 2
Gunnin’ some haters along the way, I expect to
I think these niggas mad cuz we go harder than the rest do
Sayin’ I’m the shit, well appoint me to them restroom
You care less about the money, where respects do
I’m Bob Fischer they contemplating my next move
And scratch these niggas off, that’s the object
Niggas only buzzin’ cause my team hasn’t dropped yet
I’m the hottest out, if you ain’t get the news
Fuck what these niggas talking, we let they’re bitches choose
Loyalty is all you know, it ain’t no switch of cruise
Feeling like we popped to blow and these suit might’up lit the fuse
Real nigga, my hate is wish that it was one (real nigga)
Going hard to recognition, the bandz come
Scrilled so much, nigga, you have thought I lost the loved one
Money over everything, these bitches above none

(Hook: Euroz)
Beltbuckle, iron mask
Walk up in the club, exorcism, ‘em niggas turn heads
Celebrating, make a toast, nigga burnt bread
Killed everything, that’s what my nigga Euroz said
The summer’s ours, the winter’s too
Top down in the winter that’s what winners do
Fuck niggas, these bitches too
All I need is this money my nigga it’s a due

(Verse 2: Meek Mill)
Before you get them hoes, get your money right
And I don’t fuck with broke niggas they’re the funny type
Man I got every car, I live a hell of life
But still I’m spending racks up on that jet to see my son in there
Bullets smile on his face, hundred thousands, fully case
Just to set my niggas free, Mr Chao when we ate
Want my niggas spanked out, dripped up, drake down
All these flows they’re in my crib, my shit look like drake house
Fuck niggas, them bitches too
Testifying on your homie, that’s what snitches do
Selling bricks and buying foreigns when we get into
I’m in the yellow panorama, look like pikachu
Hah, these niggas mad ’cause I’m on now
And everytime I’m in the building it be going down
I don’t make it rain, I make it pour it down
And money ain't a thing top down that boy found

(Hook: Euroz)
Beltbuckle, iron mask
Walk up in the club, exorcism, ‘em niggas turn heads
Celebrating, make a toast, nigga burnt bread
Killed everything, that’s what my nigga Euroz said
The summer’s ours, the winter’s too
Top down in the winter that’s what winners do
Fuck niggas, these bitches too
All I need is this money my nigga it’s a due

(Verse 3: Euroz)
Bottle after bottle, get ‘em refilled
Young, rich niggas book’em finest on the streets still
Groupies got parkinson, just hard feeling em keep still
Feeling like you running, now you know how me and Meek feel
My nigga, I’m really winning these days
Switch is suicidal, the women I swim in these days
I knew from the beginning we was finna be paid
And even know this life is good I ain’t finna behave
Nigga we straight, so I can give two shits
Knowing this is opportunity, only a few get
Whole team balling, we the modern day blue chips
And keep your girl close ’cause she provoking us to do list
And niggas date ride’em, well of course to get seen
And if she see a line, she go sort that shit clean
These bitches be tryna kick it like they fourty fifteen
Knowing that I’m winning, I’m coursed to get green

(Hook: Euroz) x2
Beltbuckle, iron mask
Walk up in the club, exorcism, ‘em niggas turn heads
Celebrating, make a toast, nigga burnt bread
Killed everything, that’s what my nigga Euroz said
The summer’s ours, the winter’s too
Top down in the winter that’s what winners do
Fuck niggas, these bitches too
All I need is this money my nigga it’s a due
