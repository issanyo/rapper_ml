[Intro: Meek Mill]
We been running through that paper all season
Show you niggas how to do that money shit, ooh!
Dat be Maaly Raw

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Check check, run it up, run it, run it, run it up
Young niggas stayed down with me, now we comin' up
Stacked the whole winter just so we could fuck the summer up
Come around the corner in some new shit, 'bout to fuck 'em up
Check check, fuck 'em up, slap that cash, fuck it up
I flipped me some work, went to my jeweler, tell him bust me up
Shawty 'bout to bust it down, she know I don't bust it up
I know she gon' fuck me now, I been puttin' numbers up

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Check check, numbers up, yeah I'm 'bout to fuck it up
I'm the type to treat a hundred thousand like a hundred bucks
Buy your bitch some Lou's and brand new bags and now she fuck with us
Check check, and we don't really fuck with her
Whippin' them V's, spendin' them B's
Say I be ballin', like I'm in the league
Sippin' the dirty, poppin' the P's
Sucker ass niggas be hatin', that shit a disease
Spinnin' the corner, buckin' the quarter
Fuckin' up order, like we fuckin' the warden
Crossin' the border, to put in my order
Man go with the bricks, I make her [?] with the whiff

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Check check, run it up, run it, run it, run it up
Young niggas stayed down with me, now we comin' up
Stacked the whole winter just so we could fuck the summer up
Come around the corner in some new shit, 'bout to fuck 'em up
Check check, fuck 'em up, slap that cash, fuck it up
I flipped me some work, went to my jeweler, tell him bust me up
Shawty 'bout to bust it down, she know I don't bust it up
I know she gon' fuck me now, I been puttin' numbers up

[Verse 2: YBS Skola]
Let me get with the Chasers on this shit, Skola
Numbers up, we been puttin' numbers up
The Shiners and the Chasers, nigga 'bout to fuck the summer up
Summer up, we 'bout to fuck the summer up
Last year I was only twenty, ask the streets, I had a hundred up
Had to get somebody in the fam to put the money up
Goonies right behind me cruisin' slow, they in a Hummer truck
'bout to cop a sixty-three, give these niggas bubble guts
Take a forty-one to Joe and tell 'em step my Bezel up
I'm ready now, I'm heavy now
More than four chickens stashed in the Chevy now
Got that Whopper on me, feel like Fetty now
Rollin' with the Shiners, they ain't gon' let me down

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Check check, run it up, run it, run it, run it up
Young niggas stayed down with me, now we comin' up
Stacked the whole winter just so we could fuck the summer up
Come around the corner in some new shit, 'bout to fuck 'em up
Check check, fuck 'em up, slap that cash, fuck it up
I flipped me some work, went to my jeweler, tell him bust me up
Shawty 'bout to bust it down, she know I don't bust it up
I know she gon' fuck me now, I been puttin' numbers up
