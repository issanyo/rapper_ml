[Intro: Alicia Keys]
You should say it right now

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody wanna buy a heart?
Cause I don't use the shit anyway
But okay, I guess it's my fault
Westside shorty, with an eastside nigga
They say it's levels to this shit, I'm a G5 nigga
And every city I be in, you know she fly with us
It's like Hov got Bey, it's like Bey got Jigga
Really though let me take y'all back
'09, double R drop top with the top down
Pulled up, double parked, hopped out, tried to spit my game
It didn't work, got shot down
But I can tell by the bag, by the wrist, by the ring on that
Somebody had it on lockdown
The moral of the story not to speak on that
She on the team, shorty mine now
And we don't ever ever ever make love
And we don't ever ever ever say "love"
Unless I'm all up in it, she tellin' me she love that D on that, say yeah
Bad bitch, ain't nothin' made up
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy
The heart from a real one from Philly reppin' that north side?

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Anybody? Anybody?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy time?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy a heart?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna wanna buy?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy love?
Anybody, anybody, anybody wanna buy time?

[Verse 2: K. Michelle]
Mama said don't need no nigga
Daddy said don't trust these niggas
So I started to stack them figures
And then my ass got bigger
And that's when shit got realer
And then shit got worse
So many wounds, still ain't heal
But the shit don't hurt
Really though, I don't wanna go back to the old K
When shit wasn't all good
But I'm tryna change everything
Still misunderstood
Anybody, anybody, yeah
Anybody wanna buy a heart of a girl who just keep cryin'?

[Hook]
