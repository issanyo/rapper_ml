[Verse 1: YFN Lucci]
I was down, shit was slow
Nigga say he got them bags, but that shit hot, yeah
All we know is lay 'em down, yeah we gon' plot
And if it's in there we gon' go in a nigga's spot
Uh, slangin' out that bando, we was grindin' for sure
My brother workin' that stick, they keep on swangin' that door
My partner just caught a five 'cause he got caught with that pole
Got to keep your mouth shut and play the game how it go, yeah
Hustlin', yeah we were hustlin'
Nigga get out of line, hell yeah we gon' bust him
Niggas that be talkin' behind your back, you can't trust 'em
And two words to a snitch nigga, motherfuck 'em, yeah
Makin' plays like I'm in the NBA, in and out of state
Tryna feed my kids and beat a case
My lil partner got that iron on him, dying to catch a case
Sippin' 'round, pourin' nines, fuck a line we need a case, yeah hey

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Hustlin', every day we hustlin'
Got to feed the fam so every day we hustlin'
Yeah you know we hustlin'
Every day we hustlin'
Tryna get an M so every day we hustlin', hey yeah
Slangin' out that bando, we was grindin' for sure, yeah
Hustlin' every day, we tryna get a bankroll, yeah
Everytime you see me you know I'm tryna get more
Got to hustle, stack that paper, yeah that's the way it goes, yeah

[Verse 2: Young Scooter]
Three sixty-five hustlin' means we grind all year
You see this Rolex 'round my wrist, bitch I shine all year
I'm the Jugg King so I get jugg man of the year
I was locked up, juggin' out my cell for real
Working out that condo, we was jugging for sure
Bust down a thousand pounds, sweep twenty pounds off the floor
Still got that ninety-seven Acura, with a spot in the floor
I'm 'bout these bricks for life just like that boy Shawty Lo (L-O)
A lot of niggas jugg but they can't jugg like this
I got collard greens and I got all white fish
And I don't need a ho 'cause I could buy your bitch
It take a real nigga to live a life like this

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Hustlin', every day we hustlin'
Got to feed the fam so every day we hustlin'
Yeah you know we hustlin'
Every day we hustlin'
Tryna get an M so every day we hustlin', hey yeah
Slangin' out that bando, we was grindin' for sure, yeah
Hustlin' every day, we tryna get a bankroll, yeah
Everytime you see me you know I'm tryna get more
Got to hustle, stack that paper, yeah that's the way it goes, yeah

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Trappin' out the bando, thirty shot extendo
Pop the cartridge in like we playin' Nintendo
Put some paper on 'em, make them niggas get low
Shootin' and they tellin', that's them niggas M-O, ho!
Remember them nights, where was they plannin' them nights?
Remember my nigga, all we had dinner was rice
We was just gettin' it right
Out on that corner then they ran up on us 'cause we tryna win win win
We catch a new case and get back out of jail and we do it again-gain-gain
Four on a baby, that one twenty-five, they feel like McGrady and we let 'em fly
Maybe I'm wrong, I pray that we kill 'em and we never die
Be with some niggas that stand up, they only get down on their knees just to pray to Allah
We the type [?] of them niggas to spray all them niggas like brrr and go to Dubai
You know that it's on, nigga we

[Chorus: YFN Lucci]
Hustlin', every day we hustlin'
Got to feed the fam so every day we hustlin'
Yeah you know we hustlin'
Every day we hustlin'
Tryna get an M so every day we hustlin', hey yeah
Slangin' out that bando, we was grindin' for sure, yeah
Hustlin' every day, we tryna get a bankroll, yeah
Everytime you see me you know I'm tryna get more
Got to hustle, stack that paper, yeah that's the way it goes, yeah
