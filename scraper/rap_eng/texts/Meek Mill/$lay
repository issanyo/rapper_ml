[Intro: Meek Mill]
Yeah
Chasing
Chasing that bag, chasing that bag
Chasing
Whoo
Aye
Lil' fish

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Woke up this morning I had a ménage
Loaded the foreigns I packed the garage
We do it big like we back in the Stuy
Maybe I’ll sell if I rap and I lie
Maybe I'll sell if I let niggas write it
These niggas swagger jacking and they buyin'
This for my niggas trappin' out them Hondas
Tryna get designer, Gucci they attire
Walk in this building, it's quiet
I break a heart then I buy it
I probably get her a Birkin
I take that back, shit I'm lying
I'm on the jet when I'm flying
I'm in the Bentley, I'm wheelin'
I'm in the trench with my niggas and I know the feeling to see 20 million
Funny money niggas counterfeit
I could tell you ain't been around the shit
Like a swiper, when I got the black card
80 up in Barneys if I count the fit
Seen the money, and I know the sound of it
It go (vrrrt vrrrt!)
That's a lot of it
Know that language that money machine clicking
They been rap dissing, I ain't seen, niggas
Know Omelly ready, I got Dean with us
And that 7 on me, I got Leem with us
Like that dirty dirty, how I lean niggas
And wrist on subzero like freeze nigga
Finish them niggas, yeah I put an end to them niggas
I'm on the roof with that scope
When I hit them little bitches like Remy my nigga

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You save 'em, we slay 'em
Girl I ball

[Verse 2: A$AP Ferg]
Whip whip whip, whip it
Me and your bitch in a Bentley
Making it rain when she strippin'
Hold up the umbrella like Bentley
Fuck with a nigga that's righteous
Call me Mr. East Coast I'm the tightest
I remember when bedbugs was biting
God bless me like a nigga got sinus
Ooh, Holy Ghost, I'm a baptist
Fucking them ratchets
Might get a Met Gala actress
Who give me the top when I slap it
Feeling like DJ Khaled
She grindin' on my dick getting careless
Man I had to kill this beat, I'm a savage
Meek Milly top 20 on the atlas

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Back in this bitch and you know we reloaded
Look at the credits and tell you who wrote it
I had that bitch on my dick and she rode it
And she wouldn't speak to you niggas and you know it
I'm out in Cali I'm looking for Khloe
Kylie and Kourtney or maybe a Kendall, finesse with that swagger
You know I'ma swindle you niggas don't get into shit that I'm into
Shit that I'm saying will prolly offend you
You acting rowdy like Bobby was with you
You only talk when that molly up in you
Man, you'll figure out when that tommy'll hit you
Got bad bitches in the A, down in MIA, talking in the bay
When I'm on the west, we ain't giving fades
Cause I got the cake, Draco with the laser on it
I hit her page, I'm on it
I like her pictures for warning
DM that bitch for the kill
She answer back, I'ma swarm it
Probably all be in Florida
I put your bitch in that cool water
Say I remind her of 2Pac
32 shots in my oowop
She fuck me good, get a new Benz
She keep it tricking a new shop
Went to Miami on Monday
By Tuesday I heard that them dudes shot
I do not know about situations
'Cause I never ever talk to cops
I will not speak if you made a statement
Cause I know the do's and the do not's

[Hook: A$AP Ferg]
You save ‘em, we slay 'em
Girl I ball

[Outro: Takbar]
Look at the ride it’s filthy
Look at that shit man
Earlier I was just standing there looking at this shit
Like god damn
There’s really a Wraith, a Bentley, a Bentley, a Maybach and a bullet proof car
This the shit i really be on you know what I'm saying
It’s the life
Im really happy around like
This is real shit
