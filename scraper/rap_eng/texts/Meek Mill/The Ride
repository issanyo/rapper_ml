[Intro]
See when I do joints like these
I do it for the young'en in the ghetto
That you ain't go'n never hear his story
'Cause he ain't gonna make it to tell ya
So you know what's crazy?
I went to court the other day, the D.A. say she hate me
How you gonna hate me when me and Lou just took 20 racks
And put coats on them kids back
It's 30 degrees outside

[Verse 1]
24, how could I ask for more?
I got my deals, it's gettin' real, I'm makin' cash fo' sure
Stuntin' every chance I get, because I had it poor
But every time I go to sleep I hear the devil at my door
And I'm on them papers so them courts I'm goin' back and forth
Dealing with probation, man, they all said I'd be back for sure
Mommies turned to zombies from that raw
Because it's crack galore
You wonder why them babies runnin' crazy 'steady clappin' off
Gettin' life before they get pussy
Cause ain't nobody love'em so they lives get took'en
Locked in cages, have'em fighting over cookies
And lunch trays, just happy them days ain't never killed 'em
Yeah, I remember, it was a hot December
Niggas die on top of winter
Cause them kids need them toys
Well, Santa Claus don't see them boys
Or see the girls around here, there's Jack boys down stairs
No man with the big bag, just man with the big gat
Try and take your shit back cause he feel the world owe 'em
And his daughter want a Barbie bike for Christmas
He goin' show her, that the love is there, no mother there
Just her little brother there
We wash our pain with Belvedere
And use the drugs they brung us here
We get high to get by, hot dogs, no ribeyes
With tears drip from red eyes
When ends don't meet the dead lines
The D.A. said she hate me, but I don't understand
When I just rock the show in front of 50,000 fans
I think that bitch racist, she probably in the Klan
She take her pain out on me, but she probably need a man
I took my mom from public housin', put her in the sticks
We came a long way from welfare and gettin W.I.C
That shit just made me hungry
And now we gettin' rich, and all these niggas gettin' sick
I know they wanna get me hit cause I'm ballin'
Yeah, cause I'm ballin'

[Outro]
It's like sometimes I always gotta let these type of joints go man
Just speakin' to the streets
That bitch said she hate me
I felt some type of way about that
Last night we just came out
Giving 2, 3 hundred pair of shoes to the schools
To the girls and the boys basketball teams
How you hate me?
You hate me cause I'm doin' what I'm suppose to do'
And I got that money and I'm making more money than you
Well, bitch you can hate me for that
Let's get it
