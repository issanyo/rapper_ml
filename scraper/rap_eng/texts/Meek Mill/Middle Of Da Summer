Philly
Take em back to the Plat, Meek!

[Chorus]
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
In the middle of the summer
I used to play the block all night til the sun came up
Everybody got they gun game up
In the middle of the summer
Middle of the summer
Middle of the summer

Stack all winter just to stunt in the summer
Ridin in my new camaro, sometimes I wonder
Will it take me under or will it make me stronger
Thinking the times when I was broke it only gave me hunger
Shorty walking through the block it only made me wonder
My homies was sellin dope and doin jay-z numbers
Niggas smoochin wrist was cold and throwin AC numbers
They on it was from the zone, used to say we youngins
But we was ready though
Around the time when all the rap was on the radio
Me and my niggas on the block with hammers heavy though
I used to put it in my hand ain't wanna let it go
Ain't wanna let it go, no
The work was low the numbers was right
Used to play the summer league a couple youngins was nice
They ain't make it to the league cause it'll fuck up your life
In the middle of the summer when you fucking with white

[Chorus]
Charlie nix marching through screamin stop the violence
He had will smith with him tried to stop the wildin'
But as soon as they left the hood, man shots was fired
Ambulances rushin somebody mama cryin
They say the good don't make it here
Ain't no fightin hammer time and they gon take it there
North rushin, cops lock you like Jamaican hair
Young boul, sixteen, and got eighty years
Middle of the summer, people cooking out
Old heads lookin out
Rest in peace, tears for the soldiers that got tooken out
I was in the streets, momma told me to be in the house
Ten o'clock I was on the block, moving in and out
City of brotherly love, I was only thirteen, I seen a puddle of blood
Grown man lying there, he got one in his mug
His grandma screaming, 'told you about selling them drugs!

[Chorus]
It was the middle of the summer
But it was feeling like the winter
July was feeling like December
We ball hard to the finish (uh)
They say I'm cold cause I'm a winner
We had a quarter brickies
Half of birdies
Stash box ride super dirty
Tryna get that money
Zip locks, nose candy
Back to back in them black caddies
And we said this is our summer, and we taking it there
I'm all up in this mirror, like look at this Audamars
Standing in my rear while starin at this painted mirror
Still tryna get it square
Super fly how we live
Aw knocked out lights comin, knocked out mean a bike's comin
Smellin two stroke
These Philly streets will make you lose hope
Her son was murdered now she use coke
It was the

[Chorus]
