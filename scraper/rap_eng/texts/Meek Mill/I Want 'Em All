[Intro: Meek Mill]
We get money, and we fuck bitches
We fuck bitches, and we get money
But we don’t never hate

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I can keep a secret with Vicky, have a Minaj with Nicki
And be all under with Lauren and telling Megan good morning
I can keep a secret with Vicky, have a Minaj with Nicki
And be all under with Lauren and telling Megan good morning
Catch me rollin’ with Kelly or at the hills with Paris
From Hollywood to the hood I want ‘em all
Man I swear that I want them all, wanna fuck ‘em all
I just hit them hoes but you cuff them like the law
Shit they say that I’m a dog
I just tell them that I’m greedy
But I’m cooler than a fan, holler at me when you see me

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, uh, I’m a beast like Della Reece
I fuck a lot of hoes, see em I don’t never speak
I get a lot of money stack it I don’t let it peek
I will forever be hotter than the devil be
I can start a car like a Prius is, Lexus, Mercedes, and Porches
A whole lot of horses
That’s your wifey dawg? I’d divorce her
She won’t fuck you, you had to force her
Oh I’ve been poppin’ Rose with Amber
You catch me in D Woods like a camper
The answer is I get bitches and I get money
I don’t care what you say you can’t take that from me
I’m just tryna get my dick wet, shawty is you with that?
Free my nigga Lil' ‘cause he said that
This that shit and I be on it like a fly
I’m just tryna get some chicken with some yams up on the side

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Mel Love]
Yeah, I’m the kid with all the bitches
They know I’m there when I holler like “hey bitches”
I been in for an hour [?]
And then when she swallow like baby girl I’m a holler so bye bitches
Nah I ain't tryna cuff you ma, just tryna fuck you ma
That was the aim all along
I don’t see nothing wrong with a little bump and grind
I ain’t tryna mess around, just tryna sex you down
Promise I won't hit it long
No girlfriendship, just a little friendship
Suck it, lick it, stand up and bend it over
I’m a coach and give me 5 and I’m finished
Sly dumb bitches, it’s hard dick and bubble gum
I cum like bubble gum, so come and get you some
Nah I ain’t gonna spend the night, I be gone by breakfast
By the time it’s breakfast I’ll be on the next bitch
Scrapers...

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I want to fuck em all, but I don’t fuck them raw
Nah I be strapper than a cop be, ‘cause I’m in the top 3
I done fucked her and her, her and her too, woo
I done fucked her sister, cousin, best friend the whole crew
Shit I fucked the whole squad, got ‘em open door knobs
Tell her give me floor job, on the double 4 times
Mop me off, wipe me down
Bitch I’m back, how you like me now?

[Hook] (x2)
