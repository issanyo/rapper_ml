[Intro]
Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E
Yeah, lil' fish, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I say, lord be my saviour
When it come to gettin' this paper
Please protect me from my haters
Just save me and I won't save her
Say Amen (Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen)
Yeah, they're fuckboys and they can't win
(Can't win, can't win, can't win, can't win, can't win)
Check, check, check, check

[Chorus]
Glowin' up, glowin' up, glowin' up
We in this bitch and we goin' up
Glowin' up, glowin' up, glowin' up
She dirty, love my personna
Glowin' up, glowin' up, glowin' up
Remember those feds was on us
We used to trap out them Hondas
Now we pull up in the foreigns
Glow up, glow up
Walk in, show up
Smoke one, roll up
Bad bitch, hold up
Glow up, glow up
Trap boys, don't touch
We strapped, slow up
Glow up, glow up

[Verse 1]
Yeah, I'm laughin' to the bank
All new Blue Benny Franks
Pulled up on 'em in the tank, yeah
That guy just a rap guy
I'm so mad fly and he ain't, ooh
Pussy left me baptised
Gave me head until I faint, woo
I was glowin' up out Miami
They all cornballs, they can't stand me
I finesse her out them panties
I hit raw dog, get a Plan B, hoe
Takbar, that my bro, bro
Old school, that my woah, woah
She fuck me on the low, low
Got her on strings, no yoyo
She post up for MCM and we like, "That nigga Jojo"
When we out and we see him he always ask for photos

[Pre-Chorus]
I say, lord be my saviour
When it come to gettin' this paper
Please protect me from my haters
Just save me and I won't save her
Say Amen (Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen)
Yeah, they're fuckboys and they can't win

[Verse 2]
Yeah, ate that pussy she lucky (Lucky)
I don't fuck her she fuck me (fuck me)
5 mil' cash and tuck it, ooh
Big racks on me buzzin'
I walk up in Neimans, spend 10K just like it's nothin'
I hang with the demons, they don't play by me, we cuttin'
Woo, I was coolin' out Atlanta
Mix the codeine with the Fanta
Off them Perccy's, I got stamina
I go monkey off that banana, hoe
Get a bad bitch, she gon' do just what I say
Pull up on her, fast as Uber in that Wraith
She so bad but she say put it on her face
I feel guilty, I might as well just plead my case, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
I say, lord be my saviour
When it come to gettin' this paper
Please protect me from my haters
Just save me and I won't save her
Say Amen (Amen, Amen, Amen, Amen)
Yeah, they're fuckboys and they can't win
