They say two wrongs don't make a right
But if it's my blood, someone has to die, yeah
Cause in the street life, you gotta sacrifice, oh yeah
Either my life or your life, oh
They say two wrongs don't make a right, no
But if its my blood, someone has to die, no
Cause in the street life you got to sacrifice, oh
This is either my life or your life
Either my life or your life
Either my life or your life

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Anybody tryna stop my shine gotta get it, I'll admit it
If my life on the line then we 187 whoever, I'm with it
I'm talkin' 'bout murder, we did it, and the nerve of you critics
To think somethin' of me and judge me if I shoot and murder these niggas
They murdered my dad and converted me menace
So when they come serve me my sentence
I bet I won't tell them a word of my bidness
I'll rot in that cell 'til they burn me, my nigga
And it hurt me, my nigga
To see my day ones acting thirsty 'bout bitches or money
I cut off like thirty of my niggas
Had thoughts about murking my niggas
Cause it be the closest of niggas
That change on you quick and know most of your bidness
I put this on Snupe, yeah the ghost of my nigga
I would've rode hearse with you niggas
So it's either my life or your life
And if it don't go right, gun to your face so you know right
I won't do you dirty, get hit with this four twice
So pray up and hold tight, my nigga

But if it's my blood, someone has to die, no
Cause in the street life, you gotta sacrifice, oh
This is either my life or your life
Either my life or your life
Either my life or your life
Yeah, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
Yeah, two wrongs, uh
You lost me when you crossed me
You put me in the Feds' arm reach
Call from my home out in Palm Beach
They'll lay you in the wall of concrete
My niggas ain't playin' games
When you tellin' names that we sellin' caine
We was gettin' rich, we was livin' good
We was Robin Hood to every ghetto bitch
You know that it's comin', you know that it's karma
Death before dishonor, I am Your Honor
Nancy Reagan raised a monster
They say that Ronny armed the contras
All that shit without a conscience
So why would I's have a conscience?
A generation livin' Godless, could never make it out the darkness

[Hook: Guordan Banks]
They say two wrongs don't make a right

Cause in the street life, you gotta sacrifice, oh yeah
Either my life or your life, oh
They say two wrongs don't make a right
