[Intro]
It’s Meek motherfucking Milly ya’ll
This for all my niggas that down

[Verse 1]
My niggas hard grind, we ain’t car buying
We got them S550’s call it soft nine
Yeah that’s the price up on that twerk so If you lost mine
Watch what you say out your mouth while you online
‘Cause them fed boys lock you for a long time
Conversations played in court, every word lying
Information on your boy, yeah your whole squad
Sit for talking like your boss and when you served dimes
Went from straight drops and we be cracking them grands
‘Cause niggas work been stepped on like the back of my pants
I get you murked and crapped on in the snap of my hands
We really riding, you just rapping it fam, you don’t want a war
That 44 leave your boy by that corner store
I catch you sliding send some hollows through that driver door
If it’s a problem, I'll revolve it with that collar boy
4’1, long gun, that a body boy
We don’t mean no backup ‘cause we throwing backwoods snuff
You pull that gun, I shoot you down fast as a that cracker would
Roll up and crack a wood, let’s go to hazzy baby
That coke government, 80 baby, a blaze you crazy
Bitches talk about me ‘cause I fuck then flee them probably
I don’t fucking need em' I be on my grind, all the time
I ain’t signed, I ain’t gotta shine, all the time
That’s why everyday I’m hustling ‘cause time on the line
A eye for a eye, you niggas think you coming through, I sit and laugh
CD drop, just watch what the numbers do
See me in that Bentley, continental
Call it summer blue, spending blocks
Neck blinging , you ain’t even know what to do
But I advise ya’ll, get some Tylenol
‘Cause we gon’ make you niggas sink as soon as we buy cars

[Outro]
Niggas gon’ want killers when we cop the fuck up
Niggas know how we do bloodhounds, eighth broad we don’t fall, we ball
All my niggas here, all my niggas down right now
Omelly, Donny, Rick dot, all my eighth broad niggas
Northside niggas, southside niggas, my real niggas ride to this
Niggas know how we do, we out
