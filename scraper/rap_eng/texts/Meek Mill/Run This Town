[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm screaming free my nigga TIP
Brought him from Atlanta to Philly like Mike Vick
Fighting charges lawyers say that they might stick
I was praying to God, man don't do me like this
The hoes fucking niggas with the bricks
Now they fucking me I laugh dirty bitch
Stay humble even though I know I'm the shit
But if rap don't work out then I'mma get me thirty-six
Or better seventy-two, or better 144
That's four of them you ain't know it
I break it down into O's
And I make it do what it do
That's dirty money get low
And the feds they gon' have to catch me
Or money, power, respect me
Haters used to neglect me
But now they just accept me
Failure is what they expect
The success they see in my necklace
And glory all in my story
A lot of niggas they bore me
It used to ain't matter much, but I hustle like Robert Horry
And know I'm balling like Kobe
Shit change Lebron James
And now I'm getting this money and killing them John Wayne
[?] my time came up here as fast as a leer
I dare without a fear, they try to box me out square
I ran circles around them now look at them here
They cheer that I'm on top, busting like I'm a Glock
We busting right out the box
We bust them right out the pot
And went to the jewelry and watch them bust out the watch
Me perform like a GT trick bike
Say a word I could pull your bitch like
I know sign language, we call it shine language
Let the swag talk she say its the swag fault
