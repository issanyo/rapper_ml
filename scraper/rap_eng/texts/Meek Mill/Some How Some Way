[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ya, some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah
But some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Look, all them homicides has a nigga traumatized
You know I apologized for all them times my mama cried
A couple partners died, I miss my fallen soldiers
For them I'm spittin' fire, like the kid got halitosis
They call us vultures, but we ain't have no cultures
Nothin' in the fridge, lot of rats, lot of roaches
Same city as Obama and Oprah
But niggas 13 totin' guns, they'll smoke yah
Now I'm about to open up, they ain't have no hope for us
I ain't ever seen Ye, he ain't ever showed us nothin'
In the hood every day, servin' all the smokers
Young nigga gettin' older, heart got a lot colder
Right from wrong, shit nobody never showed us
I might as well listen to this devil on my shoulders
I had a dream I was whippin' in the Rover
Then I chased the dream, got the cream
Out the hood by any means

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ya, some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah
But some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Salt and pepper, hot sauce in my noodles
Mama workin', dinner time Toaster Strudels
You make it out, they act like they ain't ever knew you
It's funny when niggas you love wanna do you
Kill you about a green piece of paper, you a hater
Trained us to kill our own selves, niggas better wake up
Knew it was never love when I seen the Roc break up
Damn, hope this money don't ever change us
From flippin' on mattresses, bastard kids
Grew up, gotta trap and get, trap and shit
Comin' home with rats and shit
Mama screamin' at me, "Who the fuck cash is this?"
Now I write my mama's check, I tell her, "Cash this in"
And I never judge people, seen a pastor sin
When I was broke, these niggas all gave me their ass to kiss
But I still put 'em on 'cause I'm past that shit
We tryna make it out

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ya, some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah
But some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
Remember havin' 50 cent to my name for lunch
A quarter juice and some hot flames
We was sittin' on the couch watchin' He Got Game
My homie could've been Jordan but he got changed
Yeah youngin' had hoop dreams, but I knew a few fiends
That I could serve, prolly get them Jordans and some new Js
The main objective was to make it out
By any means, if I find out where the plug stay I'm stakin' out
A long ways to go, but look how far we came
You can look into a nigga's eyes, you can see the pain
Everybody with you when it's sunny, that's the game
But 99% of niggas leave when it rains
My neighborhood; dream killin', life stealin'
He wanna be a hitta 'til he got life in prison
Racist ass police just tryna convict him
It's crazy 'cause 9 out of 10 gon' be a victim

[Chorus: PnB Rock]
Ya, some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah
But some how, some way
We gotta make it out the hood some day
Can't lie, I still wake up and juug some days
Just to make sure that my family good some days, yeah
