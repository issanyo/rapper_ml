[Intro: A$AP Ferg]
Yeah, yeah
Pray to the trap
Pray for the trap

[Verse 1: A$AP Ferg]
Send them niggas to the Hood Pope
My synagogue right in the ghetto
Off the dome, I'm killin' niggas
But the pen game on a different level
One trap with a big dream
I go hard, won't ever settle
"Go in for the kill" what they taught me
Boy I'm movin' that Shark Tank
In this bitch like I'm Clark Kent
Got a deal with the devil like y'all say
It's for the love of the money, what y'all think?
Fuck a wack bitch what I won't do
Make a bill with these vocals
And the Pro Tools, thought I told you
Pedal or metal, I try to slow down but I can't
Fuckin' yo bitch and she kissin' the dick
And I'm startin' to feel like I'm Tank
Chasin' the commas on commas
Embracing the drama that come with the fame
Put that on my momma, the llamaâ€™ll
Hit ya designer and pardon your brain, so stay in ya lane
Huh, yeah, I'm fuckin' your bitch in a park
I bust in her mouth cause she parched
She throwin' it back with an arch
You cuffin' that bitch like a narc
Ooh boy I don't wanna start
Two birds on my boat, I'mma start
I'm kinda like Noah's Ark
I am leaving this Earth with a mark
I ain't got time for you marks
I aim at your head like a dart
He lay on the street with a chart
Spike on his head like he Bart
I'd rather be chasin' the cream
Trappin' and trappin', I never be slackin'
I'm countin' a million a dream

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I had a trap and a dream, trap and a dream
One trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene
Trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I had a trap and a dream, trap and a dream
One trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, yeah
Trap and a dream, uh, Mac with the beam, yeah
Left Hollywood, damn, back to the fiends, woo
Pull up in my hood, skrt skrt, Maybachs on the scene, hoo
In the back like a spleen, hoo, hunnid racks in my jeans, aw yeah
Know a couple niggas want me dead in my hood
Do some charity, I put some bread in my hood
Pussy niggas snitchin', got the feds in my hood
It's like all the real niggas really dead in my hood
I been runnin' it up, fuckin' it up, plenty
Hop out the spur, jump in the truck, Bentley
Neosporin, I'm in the cut, chilly
Mask on, mask off, reppin' my set, Philly
I got thrity-six O's, we gone put it on a roll
That boy silent, never told, fuckin' models out the Vogue
And I rock a lot of gold, all these diamonds on me froze
I called papi for the low, he gon' drop it, Lord knows
I got a

[Chorus: A$AP Ferg]
Trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I had a trap and a dream, trap and a dream
One trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene
Trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I had a trap and a dream, trap and a dream
One trap and a dream, trap and a dream
I wanna make a hundred million when I hit the scene
