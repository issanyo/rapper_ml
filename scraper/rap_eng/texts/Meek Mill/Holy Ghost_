Picture me giving niggas a portion when I can hit the dealer and buy all my killers Porsches
They gon' slide on you if I tell them ride on you
Then them secure niggas ready to die for you
All my niggas pull up with .30s and fire on you
Suddenly when it hit you, somebody done lied  to you
This the summer I'ma have to beat my hittas
Check, check, check
Fucking famous bitches, countin' paper
Check, check, check
I got shit about you, I won't say it
Pay to watch your mouth, you keep on quiet
I'm gon flame on you bitches, play no games with you bitches, no way
My condolence for you losses, I just pray you ok
Used to hail lord for you, now I'm swinging that cake
So if you ride with my opps, then get the fuck out the way, hoe
