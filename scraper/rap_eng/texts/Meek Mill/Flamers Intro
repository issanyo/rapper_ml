[Intro]
Let it rock
Flamers!
Yeah, it's your boy Meek motherfucking Milly
You know that's all I got
Giving you niggas what the fuck you waiting for
Ya know what I mean?
Why you hating on me when the whole hood waiting on me
I'm Harriet Tubman to these little underground niggas
Cause I'm running this shit right now
And it ain't no rap, I ain't got nobody holding my shit
Cause I got all hot shit, and there's no need for that
Shoutout to all my niggas
Shoutout to differs everybody
It ain't on no shit, but I don't need it
Ya know what I mean, it's your boy Meek Milly
Free my nigga Lil
Flamers!
