Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Hook - Kirko Bangz]
Ok, I wake up in the morning and I see dollar signs
Said Shawty wanna roll and I’m like oh man she fine
I got money all in my pocket and my Audermar on shine
So why you hating on me, huh, I’m just living my life
I’m just young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
Young and I’m getting it, young and I’m getting it
I’m just young and I don’t give a shit
I just want the money, y’all can keep them bitches
Cause I’m young and I’m getting it, I’m young and I’m getting it

[Meek Mill]
Yeah, young nigga I get money and fuck hoes on my spare time
She don’t fuck on the first night, then she don’t meet my dead line
Niggas smoking that Bob Marley, that Bob Marley like yeah molly
I’m sipping on the whole eigth of that purp shit, bed time
I cop fours like yours, y’all niggas ain’t important
Shawty want that molly, and I’ma get what she order
Tats all in my body, strapped up like a war
Eat the pussy I prolly, if it smell like water
Her neck talk say fuck me, my wrist talk say suck me
The niggas claiming they balling, I take your bitch Chris Humphrey
And make them buy me a whip nigga
Nothing less than the 6 nigga
Y’all run yall mouth like hoes, all you are some bitch niggas

Okay, your baby mama, I ball that, side chick I ball that
Main chick, I ball that, and your dream girl just called back
I’m still repping that north side with that big P on my ballcap
These broke niggas don’t like me, cause they say I think I’m all that
Now come cop that ‘rarri, I don’t need to feel sorry
Niggas claiming my flows, I took petty niggas on maury
And I ain’t claming these hoes, have these haters looking all sorry
When I pulled up in that Roll’s, swag was surfing on ‘em like narley
Like 3 hoes like Santa Clause, saying I’m the boss, ya’ll interrupt
Hit you girl by mistake nigga, wasn’t even in my plan at all
I told homie I hit it there, these niggas wanna be planned all
Knowing that girl is main thang, that shit don’t like nigga, bang, bang
