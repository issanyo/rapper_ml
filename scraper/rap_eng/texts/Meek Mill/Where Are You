[Verse 1: Guordan Banks]
Follower, there's a leader in you
You don't have to turn around
You don't have to make the news
You don't have to break a heart
Another mother falls apart
And leave her children in the dark
And you go hiding all your scars

[Hook]
Don't gotta bring you to my rules, the sirens of today
Don't gotta change who you are to fit in some kind of way
I know the worst thing about being down when you're proud
Is you can't live it out, but you gotta find a way
Gotta find a way
Where are you?
I need you here
Where are you?
So we all can cheer
I hear what the cops don't hear
I hear that the streets are clear
I hear what you don't think I hear
I hear, I hear
And I'm here for you

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Somebody call 911
Old lady in the window, hope that's not my son
Laying under them sheets, somebody just got murdered
Ain't nobody seen it, but everybody they heard it
It was a cold night in Philly, under the moon
Youngin' thought he was cool, he was running with goons
It was summer of June, he was tucking the tool
He never thought the night ahead would be the one on the news
Cause last week he robbed Keith, but Keith wasn't sweet
Caught him for 9 ounces and stuck him up with the heat
Karma a motherfucker, he just prayed the other week
But the week after he prayed, they shot him down in the streets
Early age to an early grave
Playing with them hammers in his early days
First class ticket to the pearly gates
Lash out running with the dogs
Why woah?

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Not a day goes by
That you don't wanna cry
And deep down inside
You living a lie
Whatever's facing you
Put your faith into
Every dream is possible

[Hook]
