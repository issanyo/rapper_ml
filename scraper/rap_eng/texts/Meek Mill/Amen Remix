Woah
Now there's a lot of real christians in the building (Amen)
Bout to get my sins all forgivin (Amen)
We bout to praise god in this building (Amen)
My friends say go to the party
And I say no becasue i got to go to church(Preach)
I said i gotta go to church (Preach)
I gotta praise god in that church (Preach)
Try to rash me and i say church (Ahh Preach)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
God the best and he always got my back
He always loves me that why im part of his pack
He's the best never gotta wait cuz i know he's always there opening that gate
I'm bout to heaven so i can see him nice
On them clouds man thats god right
That the cross he died there, just for me thank you god for my life yo
I'm praying everyday that anyone who's homeless gets better, better
If your sick let god touch you becuase you he got you
He's not fake thats my god
