My Verse :

My Nigga What's The Issues , Cause It Gotta Stop

The Balla Brothers , Yeah We Calling All The Shots

Catch N Shoot It , Like Curry & Klay Coming Of The Block

There Was No Place At The Bottom So We Heading To The Top

How Ironic The Winners Focus On Winning

& The Losers Focus On The Winners

You Gotta Problem Lil Nigga 
Ima Address The Issue So You Can Just  Remember

Ive Been Thru It All & I’ve Been Thru A lot

But I'm Always Trynna Get Thru Allah

When I Wrote This , It Was Like 2'Oclock

Not 2:05 , Nigga It Was 2 On The Dot

My Heart Is Really On It’s Last Leg

I Can't Paddle Nomore , This Shit On It's Last Peg

I'm Like Woooo , Let's Just Take A Minute

I've Then Been Thru It All , Let's Just Wait A Minute

Niggas Pointed A Gun At Me & My Own Bro Left Me

A Nigga Wasn't Moving Right So My Own Hoe Left Me

Ambidextrous , I Use Both But I’m My Own Lefty

If You ain’t Jordan with nike then don't check me

I’m just Trynna Get the respect b

Not Trynna be a dead beat

I'm just really ready

I wrote this on Saturday 
If it ain't a S.A.T then lil nigga don't test me
, just forget me

Chorus :

Baby It’s Just Not That Simple

Shawty You Ain't Really Want I'm Into

She Told Me To Be Rough But Not  Gentle

So Baby Tell Me What's Really The Issues

* Meek Mill Voice *

Popping All This Shit, Need A Tissue

Can't Trust A Bitch, Cause I Got Issues

Young Rich Nigga So Official

Next Up, Disrepectful, Might Offend You
(Woah) !

My Verse 2 :

I Don't Got Birthdays , Cause I Level Up

Lil Nigga Getcha Besel Up

Always Them & Never Us

Triple Doubles Like I'm Russ

I Don't Care What You Rented 
My Grey Goose Sip The Best

King Of The Court , 1 Shot , Bang Like Yeah Who's Next

These Groupies Got My Phone Jumping

Florida Weed Got The Dope Pumpers

Party Litt , Got The Hoes Coming

I Bet This Beat Got My Bros Stuntin

I Love When Bitches Call Me Daddy

Shawty Slim Thick With A Fatty

She Buss It Open Make It Nasty

My Lil Shoota Got The Ratty

I Fucked This Bitch , Got The Hoe Cherished

From Brotherly Love & Hurricane Season 
Bitches Know That I Know Eric

(I Did This Shit With No Edit)

Lucky Told Me That We All Cousins 
Just Like In Poetic - Justice

This Buzz Got Me I Can't Function

It's Better When You Came From Nothing

Ya Girl Feening To Touch My Polo Draws

I'M Too Smooth With This Flirting Shit 
She Ask Me If My Polo's Soft

I Know It All But I'm Not A Know It All

I Just Wanna Take On The Risk

Nigga Look At My Risk

Just Look What I Did

I Done Came From The Bottom To The Top
Now Look How We Live

10k For A Flick , If You Wanna Risk

The Way I Started It , I Gotta Finished It

Niggas Know I Ain't Gone Quit Cause Im Too Legit

Thank God Phil Outta Here , We Got The Newer Knicks

Chorus :

Baby It's Just Not That Simple

Shawty You Ain't Really Want I'm Into

She Told Me To Be Rough But Not  Gentle

So Baby Tell Me What's Really The Issues

* Meek Mill Voice *

Popping All This Shit, Need A Tissue

Can't Trust A Bitch, Cause I Got Issues

My Verse 3 :

Im The Realest Balla Nigga If You Ask Me

Got Top While Her Parents Was Home Just Ask Gee

Im Always Sipping Liquor So Yall Can Never Gass Me

Im Too Far Away So Yall Can Never Past Me

I'm Just Trynna Put My Mans On

1St Pick I Land On

This A Fucking Stand Off

Don't Wanna Get My Hands On

Cause Anything I Touch I Turns Gold

I Might Not Be Derrick But It Turns Rose

I Pictured Me N Dave East .. He With Them 30 Niggas

Im With My Balla Brothers

He Got Them Dirty Sippers

10K For A Flick Image Them Dirty Pictures

Stove Pot Was Litt Just Image Them Dirty Whippers

Don Q Said Look At Me Now

He From HighBridge Where The Boogie Get Down

And Somebody Tell Young M.A Pass Me The Hot Sauce

If You Got The Open Shot Then Shoot The Rock Dawg

The Whole Block Hot Shit Bout To Get Hot Nigga

Rowdy & Bobby Told Me To Be A Hot Nigga

In Florida Its Always Hot Nigga

While New Yorks Kinda Cold
Over Here Its Gonna Be A Hot Winter
(Gang) !
