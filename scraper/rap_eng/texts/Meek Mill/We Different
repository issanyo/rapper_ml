[Intro: Meek Mill]
Turn my voice up some
We different
Turn everything up in the headphones
Turn me up some Cruz

[Hook: Meek Mill]
We different, my nigga we different
My niggas is different
We different, just look at our wrists
My niggas is different
We different, my nigga we different
Just look at our bitches
We different, my nigga we different
My nigga we different

[Verse 1: Tracy T]
Clip that thirty watch [?]
Banana peels niggas walking on 'em
The money got me living how I want to
Just shook the hundred nigga that was nothing
458 not the California
Pink slip nigga Tracy T the owner
Got it out the mud clean the dirty money
Usain Bolt niggas no running
It ain't no smiles nigga mad rich
Try to front pound differnt [?]
I got ice on my talking Aspen
Come through chopper on [?]
I move the hard like I move the soft
Hundred came it I got a hundred off
Trying to get it bitch I made myself a boss
VVS's on me I ain't got to floss
Christian Louboutin inside a gangster's walls
I play the corner how I break them off
And them digits bitch I got them with a fork
Tryna get them birds I'm talking Atlanta Hawks
They ain't make the same different kind of diamonds
My niggas different they just want a body
[Wide body riding] riding cause I'm different nigga
Maserati got it just to kill them niggas

[Hook: Meek Mill]
We different, my nigga we different
My niggas is different
We different, just look at our wrists
My niggas is different
We different, my nigga we different
Just look at our bitches
We different, my nigga we different
My nigga we different

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
My niggas is different, my bitches is different
I'm telling you something you already know
You reminiscing how you used to get it and talking about money that's already blown
All of these bitches are already shown
We living life like it's already gone
All of my day ones is already one
For all of you haters that's already on
So why would I play with you pussy ass rappers
I only be with the trappers
Them niggas that flipping it backwards
I'm talking 'bout when you were sleeping on mattresses
We stack up that money to put in the mattress
Hundreds get put in the stashes
My chick should could get in the pageant
Just she look like [?]
Get put in the casket you fuck with the Chasers
Don't fuck with no hater, don't be with no lame
This for my niggas that wake up and go get it, that came up from nothing from selling cocaine
Catching them cases don't tell them no name
[?]
Win it or lose it it's part of the game
Nigga we ain't the same my nigga

[Hook: Meek Mill]
We different, my nigga we different
My niggas is different
We different, just look at our wrists
My niggas is different
We different, my nigga we different
Just look at our bitches
We different, my nigga we different
My nigga we different
