[Chorus: Mike Davis]

And all my niggas know we 'bout them dollars, about them dollars, know we 'bout them dollars
And I just went and count a hundred thousand, a hundred thousand, count a hundred thousand
Spend that up and keep that money pilin', and keep it pilin', keep that money pilin'
And all my hoes just know I run the island, run the island, know I run the island

[Verse 1: Mike Davis]

Niggas mad cause that money long
I just count it, like a hundred long
Eight months, two hundred songs
Now a nigga get money for it
Paid up, and I'm laid up, with your main bitch, and I paid her
She flex on me, I flex on her, I'm Floyd May' with that paper
I'm Floyd May' with that paper
I meet your bitch then I take her
That's word to Mami I'm going crazy
My new music this shit wavy
Thirty thou' for that verse, maybe
40k for that show, pay me
I be riding 'round so crazy
I been riding 'round with your ho lately
I'm going H.A.M. with them doors up
In the crib she taking those clothes off
Staring at her like "Oh Lord"
Knock it down while I'm on tour
Activist and that dour smoke
Got me highed up, I might doze off
Activist and my cup full
I don't share drink, I just pour more, I just pour more

[Bridge: Mike Davis]

And I just dropped your bitch cause she was wilin'
And I'm just gonna keep that money pilin'
Keep that 30 in the cut just for the violence
Them 38s they with my goons they got the silence

[Chorus]


[Bridge: Keke Palmer]

Cut your nigga off cause he was wilin', wilin', keep that money pilin'
You said you was gon' take me to an island, why is you lyin', baby just be honest
I know he just wanna get behind it, he wanna drive it, cause I got better mileage
Got that Saint Laurent Balenciaga, I got them dollars, don't need you to buy it

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]

Niggas mad cause my paper straight
Been the one since like '88
And I was born in '87, put my niggas on and they crazy straight
When you shinin' hard, they throw shade your way
Fuck me good, and get a rate today
I can tell that pussy wet
'Fore I eat the box let me say my Grace, like Amen
Nigga Amen, Amen, all you gotta do is say when
Said I came when
Quarter mil' when I came in
Odds on the wheel when I came in
Took a plane in
None of y'all niggas ain't been
With a bad bitch and they friend
On a G5, with your mind blowing in the wind
Hit rewind and we doing it again
With them drinks I'ma (Pour more)

[Bridge + Chorus]
