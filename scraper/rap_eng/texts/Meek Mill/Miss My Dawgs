[Chorus: Meek Mill & Strap]
I miss my dawg (I miss my dawg)
I miss my dawg (I miss my dawg)
And they killed my little nigga
Man I wish that I was there when that shit popped off (shit popped off)
And who would’ve thought (who would've thought)
I’d ever get that call (mh-hmm, mh-hmm)
So I’m out here riding with my niggas
And we sliding, letting shit pop off (pop off)
I miss my dawg (I miss my dawg)
I miss my dawg (I miss my dawg)
And they killed my little nigga
Man I wish that I was there when that shit popped off (shit popped off)
And who would’ve thought (who would've thought)
I’d ever get that call (mh-hmm, mh-hmm)
So I’m out here riding with my niggas
And we sliding, letting shit pop off (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
They killed Chinx Drugz in his own city
They killed Lil Snupe in his own city
Wonder why I don't be in my own city
I don't know if niggas gon' clap for me or gon' kill me
Still living lavish and they still wonder why I act savage
All these guns and automatics
Still gonna murder these niggas that want to have it
Before they have me miss my son’s football practice
Fuck y’all niggas that killed Lil Snupe
And when we run in y’all niggas we gone kill y’all too
I still pray every young nigga feel that coupe
Cause young niggas feel like me, I feel like you
Fifty shades of grey, want to do me like Freddie
I pray to God, load my chopper, tell them niggas I’m ready
I’m riding 'round with my squad, it's Pmon and Omelly
I got Deen in the cut, my nigga Coon be so heavy
We got to make it back home tonight
So fuck the law, we brought the chrome tonight
'Cause the cops won’t save you, you alone tonight
So tell me young nigga am I wrong or right?

[Chorus: Meek Mill & Strap]
I miss my dawgs (I miss my dawg)
I miss my dawg (I miss my dawg)
And they killed my little nigga
Man I wish that I was there when that shit popped off (shit popped off)
And who would’ve thought (who would've thought)
I’d ever get that call (mh-hmm, mh-hmm)
So I’m out here riding with my niggas
And we sliding, letting shit pop off (pop off)
I miss my dawg (I miss my dawg)
I miss my dawg (I miss my dawg)
And they killed my little nigga
Man I wish that I was there when that shit popped off (shit popped off)
And who would’ve thought (who would've thought)
I’d ever get that call (mh-hmm, mh-hmm)
So I’m out here riding with my niggas
And we sliding, letting shit pop off (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Sometimes I miss my dad, I wish he could see me now
Rolls Royce, he wouldn’t believe me now
The way I took my mom out the hood, got Tweety round
From the jects to the burbs, I wish you could meet me now
But you died before he was even 'round
But I set him straight though, look who he be around
In the sticks with the kids where they really play soccer
When he could’ve been a nigga on the corner with a chopper
You the one that taught me how to hold my hands 'fore they got you
So I’ma fight hard for the fam until they pop us, 'til they rock us
You ain’t even get to meet my son Papi
He’s three now, and he be asking where his grandpop is
You see now, they talk 'cause they don't see my fam shopping
Now see the brand new Benz and the brand new houses
Know you see these brand new friends, acting brand new, smiling
And I just got brand new bills, that’s brand new problems
And my old homie told on me, like damn you wyling
And that shit you talk from jail don’t scare nobody
'Cause you told, you dead now
And you know, nigga walk with your head down
RIP

[Outro: Travis Scott]
Fly high, so high, fly high, so high
Fly high, so high, so long, goodbye
Fly high, so high, so long, goodbye
So high, so high, so long, goodbye
