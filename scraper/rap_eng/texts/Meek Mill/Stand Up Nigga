[Hook: Meek Mill]
Listen I'mma ball 'til I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride 'til I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'mma get it how I'm living
Crackers want to sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I be on the block with tre pound glockin' it
Bound to shot all in a nigga face like sotocovich
Got your main bitch all on my dick and she be riding it
She tell me that your fuck game suspect tried of it
I don't even let her suck me off I let her polish it
She be lollipopping it, head shot bobbing it
But back to these dirty streets where niggas on some rotting shit
Gorillas with banana clips you don't want to collide with
If a nigga got beef tell him don't go rap about it
Tell him meet me in the streets cause he know that's where I'm at
Seven days up out of the week
24 hours a day I'm in the trap I'm never sleep
I'm a east sider rider Realadel solider
Told ya niggas out my range like rover
Hold up grind like brakes with no rotors
Big boy shit wake a nigga up Folgers
My team pro-methazine soda
We ball sip lean ride roller
We all got green got yolla
Got purple by the pound haze fluffy like your sofa
That's how we move it, like it ain't nothing to it
Get the work bust it down and run right through it
Some say I spit retardo like I'm stupid
If it's 'bout a check we Nike just do it

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'mma ball 'til I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride 'til I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'mma get it how I'm living
Crackers want to sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga

[Verse 2: Nitty]
The name Nitty yo
Talk of the city yo
I get busy not afraid to let that semi go
I be in the lime light it look like a video
Never been a underdog stay on top with any flow
A million or more my shit popping out the store
If I hit her one time bet she call me back for more
I'm trying to make a million off a dollar
Gridning off the steps couldn't do it had to holler
Trapping with an attitude nothing like my father
Still on my Jay-O never man I can't let a day go
[?] get the work and they we drop it like a KO
Ask them little niggas they say I'm hotter than Waco
Texas mac spill elastic when I stretch shit
Richie on his way home and he can't wait to wet shit
Back to back vans different bitches on some neck shit
Black on black Vans laces loose fresh shit

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'mma ball 'til I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride 'til I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'mma get it how I'm living
Crackers want to sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga

[Verse 3: Black Dinero]
Who got the game on smash? who got the game on lock?
You ain't on the game on nothing you just run that game a lot
I keep that caine in pot I keep that gun on hip
Better keep your distance nigga when I lift better pray I miss
I'm 'bout that dollar dollar, that Louis Gucci and Prada
That's part of my attire I spit that rapid fire
I set that stove on fire I drop that baking water
I got some nice ass prices come on now place your order
You know I'm 'bout my change, you know I hold them things
I throw that work around that change come back like boomerangs
Roll with orangutans they flipping bust that heat
I know the feds is watching hommie I'm in these streets
Bust guns inhale the smoke bust guns if I go broke
Sometimes I bust my guns for nothing just to let you know
Grown man with too much pride I let them bullets fly
And I ain't fighting the only thing I fight is homicide

[Hook: Meek Mill]
I'mma ball 'til I fall
Spit it like I did it
Ride 'til I die with my finger on the trigger
I ain't never had nothing
I'mma get it how I'm living
Crackers want to sit me down cause I'm a stand up nigga
