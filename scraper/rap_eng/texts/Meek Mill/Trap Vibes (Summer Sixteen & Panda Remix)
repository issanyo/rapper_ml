[Part 1: Summer Sixteen]

[Intro]
Turn me up some Cruz
I told Barcelini if them niggas hatin' they gon' suffer
I'm goin' up a hundred every day
You know how I play!

[Verse]
Skinny nigga in the Benz truck
Swingin' through like a nunchuck
Summertime bring them 30s out
Tell Coon put the sticks up
Wait... hold up, hold up
How can niggas go against us?
Cold pussies wouldn't even shoot us
See us roll on 'em like a lint brush
Phil movin' out them bandos
We ain't leavin' 'til the brick's done
Couple hundred, we gon' vac seal 'em
Just to ride with it like a Brinks truck
Wait, wait, Louboutins and the wrist bust
Bitch you claiming I done been fuck
You ain't even gotta trip, bruh
In the trenches in the Maybach
Fuck I even got the tint for?
I'm the only nigga got one
Who the fuck I gotta hide from?
Barcelini ridin' shotgun
Shooters with him, never mind nigga
Young niggas on Sigel Street
Word to Mack, they'll rock somethin'
Wait, wait!
North side of Philly my side of town
Bulletproof whip when I ride around
Niggas talk shit when I'm not around
Wouldn't tell you that we run the city
But we movin', gotta say we joggin' now
Hit the city and we runnin' down
Ain't no runnin' now, niggas out of bounds
Plug this, plug that
Niggas rappin', they ain't never sold nothin'
Hold this hold that
I ain't lettin' these niggas hold nothin'
Summertime, niggas coppin' foreign whips
You can tell the load comin'
Put my name on the flyer
All the trappers, all the bad hoes comin'
Niggas dickridin' other niggas, that's a trend now
I'm still rockin' with the same Chasers I've been 'round
Got so much work out we might slim down
I'm so poppin' all my haters turn friends now
Diamonds dancin' like Mike Jackson
Shit shining like Mike's jacket
Moonwalkin' in a Rolls Royce
Through the rearview, see my life backwards
Percocets, popped two 10s on a 20, nigga now I ain't active
So wavy, nigga I ain't rappin'
Can't tell me that I ain't swaggin', no way
