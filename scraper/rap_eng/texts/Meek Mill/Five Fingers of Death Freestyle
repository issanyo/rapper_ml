[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
You ain't living how I live sucka
That's why I flex on niggas they never did love us
I'm putting checks on niggas even my kid's mother
And you ain't real if you gon' let them kids suffer
Niggas killed your cousin and you ain't did nothing
Expect run to the cops and tell them pigs something
Thirty two in my Glock I'm trying to bend something
I could murder these niggas like I'mma win something
But they don't make war for that
There's friends with double edge knives putting swords to back
Velour is black, Balenciagas on I'm strapped
I put my dawgs onto money and on the map
You want to see me extending my hand that boy's a rat
And I don't party in them clubs where informants at
Cause they watching, and the listening
And they plotting with they people they whispering

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
It don't get no realer
Sixteen with a body he a killer
Running around with a stick like Donatello
Man these niggas out to murder for that chedder
I'mma tryna tell ya niggas scheme for that green paper
Hommies killing hommies over fiend paper
Hommies killing hommies over leaned paper

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
There should be the real nigga Grammys
Where we buy  Rollies and treat them like trophies
You'll never understand me
You ain't come where I come from
Niggas on Xannies, mommy on crack how we going to feed the family
Might as well start selling it, everybody inhaling it
Young, black, and intelligent what they should have been telling us
But they was locking us in a cell with a stranger for them to raise us and wonder why we rebellious
Niggas going through pain
I was missing from school cause I was going through things
Now I'm getting this money feel like I'm going through change
Niggas driving me crazy they threw it all for the fame

[Verse 4: Meek Mill]
Money ain't the root of all evil its attention now
Knocking down schools in my city to bring a prison 'round
They killed Chinx Drugz in his own city
They killed Lil Snupe in his own city
Wonder why I don't be in my own city
I don't know if niggas gone clap for me or going to kill me
Still living lavish and they still wonder why I act savage
All these guns and automatics
Still gonna murder these niggas that want to have it
Before they have me miss my son’s football practice
Fuck y’all niggas that killed Lil Snupe
And when we run into y’all niggas we gone kill y’all too
I still pray every young nigga feel that coupe
Cause young niggas feel like me, I feel like you
Fifty shades of grey, want to do me like Freddie
I pray to god, load my chopper, tell them niggas I’m ready

[Verse 5: Meek Mill]
In the middle of the summer
In the middle of the summer
In the middle of the summer
Summertime nights out and we bring them bikes out
You could turn the lights out cause we got all this ice out
We up in here serious going crazy
Young boys getting to the [?]
Looking at the media they say I got a baby
On the way by Nicki I'm thinking the media crazy
Young nigga getting to the money
Dreams Worth More Than Money it ain't funny
Started from the bottom I remember I ain't have a dollar
I bought my first Impala
Then I bought a Rolls Royce cause I came up from the bottom they ain't give me no choice
Judge gave me five months in jail, felt like I was in Hell
Twenty three I was in the cell

[Verse 6: Meek Mill]
Sorry your honor if I was too arrogant, that money was staggering
They locked me PC with them trannies and rat, man that shit was embarrassing
Twenty three hours in the cell by myself, man you couldn't imagine it
They fed me some shit I wouldn't feed to my dog, man that shit was the nastiest
Can you imagine me losing my mind
Doing push ups 52 at a time
Do the whole deck just to get through the time
Just to get back to my son and get back to my mom
Cause Papi keep asking me where am I at
I told him in jail and I said I'll be back
He said when you back can you get me from school
Shit like that there turn boy to a goon
On to the graveyard its only one stop
We live fast die from gun shots
And in this lifestyle we sling dope, bust Glocks
Why you think we say fuck cops
Cause when they lock us up all the fun stop
And when the ice cream truck come it wouldn't stop
So for them little babies all the fun stops
They turn to goons and we post on the corner like a bus stop
Waiting on the state bus 'til the cuffs lock
They put shackles on us like jewelry we say fuck rocks
Cause all we ever wanted was to sell blocks
To get a little real estate to sell blocks
Until we got a little taste of cell blocks
And try to turn to God when these cells lock
Have mercy on me touch down catch a case trying to sell rock
And we didn't want to believe that Hell's hot
My mom told me you might as well stop
Cause you can't ride your weight when the wells drop
And your waters off and your bills due
And your shit stank smell like mildew
Cause you got wet all up and left there cause them little niggas done killed you

[Verse 7: Meek Mill]
In the kitchen like grandma
Put these bitches on stand by
When it come to getting this money fuck everything no playing time
If you real nigga you can't mind
Real niggas we can't die
Christian Loubs on their period cause their soles blooded like a tampon
I used to pray to God to get a brick nigga
Prayed to God to be a rich nigga
Prayed to God to get a brand new Rollie
All flooded on my wrist nigga
Timing is everything
I love all my niggas and my family is loyal
I'm buying them everything
Put Papi through college and everything

[Verse 8: Meek Mill]
I go out of my way to go out of my way
I give my momma a thousand a day
Like Benihana's we chopping the weight
Cause we get that work put the profit away
How would you feel if you came up from nothing and one hundred mil just a comma away
My youngins got youngins that got in the game
Cause we was out trapping when doctor was Dre
Rollie diamond the face
Look how I bust down the band I might slide to your and stop in the A
Hold up, look how I just took this bitch take her straight to the mall have her shopping away
Hold up, what you want some red bottoms
Balenciagas [?]
Shit I'm about to get some head out her
I have her twerking for a nigga that's cardio
I could kill all these rappers on audio
Video tape it and record it though
I park my whip in the handicap, why is that, cause that bitch retarded though
I could do the Bently or the Rolls call the audible
Switch it up but I probably do the Rarri though
Pick it up I forgot how that go

[Verse 9: Meek Mill]
None of you niggas put fear in my heart, we only fear going broke
And none of you niggas put fear in my heart, we cut your head by the throat
Never would hang with you suckers and rats, unless its a chair and a rope
Come in my city we live like the Mafia, and bitch I'm the head to the boat
Million dollar dreaming, really I was scheming
Feeling like a [?] when I'm off the lean
I said why you talking we don't back and forth with niggas I feel like I'm Venus
Nigga I fill up arenas, get on my level
Get on my level and maybe we hear all that shit that you talking
I heard you say you running the city and seen you in traffic and niggas was walking
