[Intro]
She ain't neva seen it

She ain't neva seen a nigga so fly like me

[Verse 1]
I'm like fresh out the prada bag
Step up in the louie one
Tearing in rellin them
We pull up in the gucci one
First you get that money then them bunnies and them cucci come
The Fans Make The Groupies come
You lame prolly do for sum
I come through your hood in that S5 pound
BItches ain't used to see me like see me know me now
Like sheba slow me down
Like shorty slow your stroll
I pop bars soon as I ball hot dog tell em roll
Forty on my neck (neck)
Forty on my Hip (Hip)
On my way to forty-forty (shorty you the shit)
Swagga so mean got me all up in the mix
Nigga hating on my style cause his shorty on my dick
I don't get mad I just get paper
Any nigga can never ever say I'm a hater
Cause if he hit mine I'm a just hit your in
And if he loving the bitch I'm a just get more

My watch glow in the glear
Prolly flow of the year
I'm like step up in the building looking like a million
My neck kinda freezing so you know a nigga chilling
Everytime you see me I be looking like a villain
My pants sagg low so you can see the 9 milli
I'm so hood it don't make no sense

Patrone got me on that haze got me so bent

Chickens like who do (oh that's omelly)
And he next (ah ah ah ah)

[Verse 3]
I'm like shorty what you talking bout
Go head and walk it out
We pull up in that 5 o'clock
The crew done stole the parking spot
460 elepent hating niggas ball the block
If getting bitches was a crime
You Niggas prolly call the cops
Cause I'm killing them
Fresh prince Will and them
I be on your block and I be pumping like adrenaline
Coppers share their watch time and I can swear I peel on them
Haters keep that steal for them
It'll calm they ass like Ritalin
Put them in their place they try to jack us
My man gone put that Cheese up on yo head just like a Packer
Them goonies they get all up in yo shit like a hacker
They pop up at ya crib an they be after you
I be in my bag
I share my swagga 1, 2
Man I don't even try I just be fly every time I do it
Like I do I come through
Tell your bitch she coming too
She hop up in that wheel that bitch be kicking kung-fu

[Bridge]
