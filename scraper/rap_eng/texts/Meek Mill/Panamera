[Intro: Omelly]
Dreamchasers
This a movement, a lifestyle
Everything foreign

[Verse 1: Omelly]
They got me flexin' in a Panamera
Niggas hatin' on me, no [?]
Got a lot of swag, got Louis kicks but I never wear em
Started coach, now it's G5 when I’m fuckin landin'
I'm a fuckin' bandit
Hol’up, I'm a fuckin' bandit
Got two hoes and it's one of me, that's a fuckin' sandwich
I get work and I pitch that and I underhand it
If you gettin' paper then why you hating?
I don’t understand it, I don’t understand it
I'm a fuckin' cannon
You mad dog 'cuz my cast long and you fuckin' scramblin'
You try to snatch my chain nigga you fuckin gamblin
You dead pockets, get a head shot, that’s DJ damage
Pussy 'cuz we ain’t playin'

[Hook x2]
I'm on that fly shit, flyer than you ever been
I'm on that real shit, realer than you ever been
I'm on that still shit, talkin' get you laid out
I'm on that Cali, what I’m blowin got me spaced out

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
They got me flexin' in a new machine
Been in corners they hatin' got me super clean
Ballin' off in Miami, I got two of them rings
I'm super rich, y'all still trippin' on "who the king"?
My niggas movin' things
I'm talkin' sky dwellers, no ice
High yella, so bright
I fell in love with that money
Then got married to it, now throw rice
Got everything your ho like, y'all niggas the ho type
Talk behind my back but when I'm around you go like it
I got more money than you and I'm younger than you
Say you broke a joke, do I look funny to you?
You can diss in your raps but when I run into you
It's gon' be "I didn't say that" or "I don't want it with you"

[Hook]
