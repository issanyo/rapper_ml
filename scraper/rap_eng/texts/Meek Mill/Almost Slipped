[Verse 1]
Ugh, every bitch I'm fuckin' say they only fuckin' me
I even bought you diamonds, put you in that double C
The way you love the game, you couldn't be in love with me
I work too hard for my name to let a bitch put mud on me
So how can I trust you? (Trust you)
When all the rich niggas fucked you (Fucked you)
Make you my baby, I'd love to (Love to)
You was a dime, but I dubbed you (Dubbed you)
When I first bagged you that shit had me excited
Swimming in that pussy, girl, I swear there's nothing like it
I got plans to cut you off, I know that you won't like it
I knew that it would come to this, I seen it like a psychic
Turned you to a savage (Savage)
I won't forget you, you a bad bitch (Bad bitch)
I set you up so you could level up (Level up)
But you was used to being average (Average)
Jumpin' on jets, you was caught up in the life
They gassed you on Instagram, you caught up in the hype
A ho gon' be a ho, so ain't no use for no advice
When you crossed me, you lost me, can't let you cross me twice

[Chorus]
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right (Fuckin' me right)
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice (Talk to me)

[Verse 2]
You fucking with a ball player and now you acting bougie
Seen you out in traffic you act like you never knew me
I just bust out laughing when I seen with you that goofy (Ha)
Savage for that money, you like Ginger from the movie, ooh
I almost fell in love with a ho
I still dream of me fuckin' you slow
Ass so fat all the stuff from the back
I still watch all our old videos
And I still hear that pussy callin' (Callin')
It's so wet, it's slippery, it let me fall in
And from the way you treated me, almost went all in (All in)
Had to check your mileage and I started stallin' (Stallin')
'Cause relationships turn into situationships
I know you don't wanna hear this player shit, but baby I'm made for this
You made your bed, you gotta lay in it
My heart can't play with this (No)
Gotta save myself before I try to save a bitch (Woah)
I ain't been cuffing on no hoes and I ain't gon' start
Had to Patek my wrist, protect my heart (Protect my heart)
Had to Patek my wrist, protect my heart
Because this cold game left my heart cold, now I promise it ain't my fault

[Chorus]
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right (Fuckin' me right)
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice (Talk to me)

[Verse 3]
Ugh, I gotta keep a vest on my heart (On my heart)
You the reason the good women got it hard (Got it hard)
Shit, we was good until our feelings got involved
That's when I did my homework and then I really got involved, oh
Oh, and I don't know how I'ma go 'bout it
Now a nigga coldhearted, baby, nobody
Get this hard, you suck the soul out me
Found out you a whole thottie
And you got a whole lotta bodies, nobody
No, you let what we had die young (Die young)
And that's word to Lil Roddy (Lil, no, no)
Soon as I thought I got one, I was like

[Chorus]
I almost fell in love with a thottie (Oh)
My dawg said "You got too many bodies" (Ooh)
Girl, that pussy had me like a zombie (Oh)
I gotta pour out my feelings that's inside me, yeah
What happened in the dark is gon' come to the light (Come to the light)
Magic from the start, you was fuckin' me right (Fuckin' me right)
Treat me like a king baby talk to me nice (Talk to me)
