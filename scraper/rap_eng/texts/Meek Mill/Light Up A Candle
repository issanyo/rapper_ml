[Hook: Meek Mill]
Come on y'all, Light up a candle
This ones for everybody that lost somebody
From the cribs to the grave to the end of the road
May god bless they soul but life goes on
I know it's probably hard and you might go through it
But life don't stop you got to keep on movin'
I'm blowin' wishes to the sky and for all of my niggas
I'm blowin' lines to the sky and I'm pourin' out liquor
Hey

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
This for my niggas on the other side
That died young and didn't make it out to see 25
Fell victim to a homicide
Murder scene yellow tape
Family members momma cry
Same scenario, it's scary though
Happenin' in the hood every day but we don't fear it though
Rest in peace to these obituaries like a merry-go
Cause it's goin round and round
State to state, town to town
Every minute on the clock somebody heart stop
And every day that's in the year someone disappear
Thinkin' on the days they coulda hit me there
No religion prayin god was good enough to keep me here
My dad died when I was young
Seen the casket rollin down into the ground, I was done
Dark nights their, turned me into a moon instead of sun
To goon instead of young nigga with a school dream

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Ms. Jade]

Me ask me was I gon' cry
Motherfuckin right I will
I was cryin in the parkin lot
Tear on the steerin' wheel
Shades on so no one would see my eyes puffy
2 months since I'm changin'
I still ain't over it
No I ain't finished mournin'
Cryin like every morning
Think about her everyday
Wishin I was in the moment
Wishin she was still here instead of these lame niggas
Why the fuck they still here
Why he have to take my sister
To see you on
Yeah I know I gotta do it
So I drink to take the pain away
Stop me from goin' through it
But it don't and it can't
And they never understand
They shot my best friend in the head
She ain't even have a chance
Ain't never get to get married
Never get to give birth
Never get to see me make it
And man this shit hurt
Uh but ride along, lay up song
Ain't plan on gettin on this song
But I did it for her
