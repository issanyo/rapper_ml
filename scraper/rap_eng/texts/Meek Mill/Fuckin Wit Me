[Intro: DJ Drama]
Most of us successful people could tell you a story
About when they wasn't fucking with us
Now that we at the top, y'all not fucking with us

[Bridge: Tory Lanez]
They ain't fuck with me when my money low
Now they tryna ride 'cause my money long

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
These niggas ain't shit, half million dollar whip, nigga
Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick
They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit
But I ain't tripping cause you niggas ain't fucking with me
Tell 'em "Nah, nah, you niggas ain't fucking with me"

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Yeah, when the money came all the hoes came too
These niggas started hating, I guess that's what fame do
And I remain who? Me! Still be with the same crew
None of my niggas don't fall out for bitches
They falling for money, we ain't you, we ain't y'all niggas
Started with a dollar and I turned that to a million
Now the Chasers in the building, it ain't hard nigga
I'm like oh lord what a feeling when you pull up
Drop the ceiling on them suckers that was watching while we starve nigga
They got fat and I got slim
So I shitted on them niggas when I got in
My homie caught me for some paper, that was not my friend
That was not my dawg, so it's fuck that nigga, knock him off
More money than you can ever think
Now we buying more PJ than we can ever drink
More than we could ever swallow
Get money that's my motto
When you in the lead there's nothing to follow
I know...

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
These niggas ain't shit, half million dollar whip, nigga
Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick
They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit
But I ain't tripping cause you niggas ain't fucking with me
Tell 'em "Nah, nah, you niggas ain't fucking with me"

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
When the money came all the problems came too
And when the problems came all they had to blame was you
And niggas said I changed, you would probably change too
When niggas is hating they catching them vapors
And mad at favors that you ain't do
They gon' switch sides
I could tell you suckers want me gone
Before I let my mama mourn, you know I'ma let that shit fly
And I used to get it on
Selling crack till it was dawn
Moving fish, and I ain't talking 'bout no fish fry
And the reason they can't keep up, cuz when they sleep you know we up
We move kilos, then re-up
I do one lap, then I speed up
With your plan A, you couldn't be us
Or see us, when it's game time
And it's 4th quarter now let's D-up
I'ma be up, with my feet up
And I'ma eat up, every beat up
That they feed us, as a fetus
I had more stripes than Adidas
And my dawg told me don't ease up, kill these niggas
And when I do murder them all me and my Philly niggas

[Chorus: Tory Lanez]
These niggas ain't shit, half million dollar whip, nigga
Tell your bitch suck a rich nigga dick
They may hate like I ain't grind for this shit
But I ain't tripping cause you niggas ain't fucking with me
Tell 'em "Nah, nah, you niggas ain't fucking with me"

[Outro: DJ Drama]
I'm on a decade of dominating the game
With the legends, the hottest MCs, and the new niggas
It's me
They ain't fuckin' with me
It's the ball
