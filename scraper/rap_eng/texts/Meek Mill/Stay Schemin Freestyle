Uh I say one life to live
So nigga Im a ball till I fucking fall
Like September gone hell a hall
Niggers act like they dont remember when I was selling raw
But since they run their mouth like bitches they can tell them broads
How I came through
Panama fling blue
Everybody bust down
And Im with the same crew
Half my homies selling dope
They dont got the same view
But we got the same goals
I used to work that same old
I used to sell them same
Tryna touch a hundred mill
Twenty four with a ghost
I swear my life is hell a real
Took them babies out the hood
Put my momma up on that hill
Got the weight up off my shoulders
Tell them that its time to kill
All the sudden all these older suckers mad
Cause only 24 and buying shit they wished they had
Is it my bad?
Or Is it my fault?
Life I live and shit I talk
Hoes I hit and the whips I park
When I did that bit they forget that part
And its all so cold
Where grown men cry
And old men die
But I ain't fold
Did them my time
None of them hope he die
But Im gonna live
Like MIA
Sunday we lie
We in that viv
And when we dib
We fly G5 nigga
I used to have a million and a bad bitch
But now I got it I treat it just like my last bitch
Got another one
Hotter than a double sun
Real homies love me cause they feel just where Im coming from
Old heads been balling
I ain't talking running gun
Use to chase the paper now the money I be running from
Ah every day I wake up I just pray to god
That I get my cake up and I stay alive
Pac Man Pac Man
Run because the ghost is out
Ross has bought a new crib
Shit it looked like Oprahs house
I just bought a new crib
My shit looks like his older house
Last of a dying bread its nothing that I told about
Yall get exported when them bricks get imported
Niggas ain't important they informants be informing
Got a crib in Malibu California
About to do Miami
Got a sting I clear my debt
I told them do it for ah
I ride for my niggers dog
I ride for my niggers uh
And I slide for my niggers dog uh
I say money in the building everybody spending
Thirty racks on me shit my pockets say I'm winning
Louboutin sneakers different colors Ill be in them
Keep a bad chick with me
I don't own her she a rental
Cause I
Wear em out
Take em back
She know I ain't stingy wit it let her make a stack
Lurking at the dealer fuck around and take this back
I get so comfy in that bitch I fuck around and I take a nap Zs
She ask me where that paper I'm like bitch please
Shout out to the jeweler make my wrist freeze
This shit that's on my hip will leave you Swiss cheese
Hit you with the whole clip
You get on some bullshit
I'm a blow this paper like its 2012
If getting money was a sin I guess I'm going to hell
If stunting on them was a crime I guess I'm going to jail
And they gonna have to give me life cause I be doing it well
I'm getting money on the regular
We don't smoke regular cause nigga we ain't regular
Got so many pretty hoes number in my cellular
All I get is straight cash shit I'm like a register
I'm balling like there's no tomorrow
Forty on my Audemar
Thirty for this Prezy piece
I think I got every sneak
I done hit so many dimes
Presidentuary sweet
Back and forth to Hollywood
MIA like every week
Can't remember my maps
Cause I got so many but now I'm back
I came from Hollywood to the trap
And I'm right back in these streets
Ridin' round with this Mac
And I ain't talking about my laptop
Talking bout the back block
Riding in a dirty whip
Hammers in the stash box
Huh? What you know about that?
I'm spitting bars off the top and they ain't flowing like that
They ain't flowing like this
Old school flow
Flowing like kiss raspy voice in the VIP
With a hundred bottle
Ace of spade doing my thing
Hot 97 they know that I'm going angry
My neck, my wrist be all bling
A lot of niggers catch cases
They ain't like me, they'll sing
When its time to see their cell
I ain't had no bail
But had a couple   bitches
They was writing me sending mail
So I had to hold it down
And now I got the crown
I ride for my niggers dog
I ride for my niggers uh
