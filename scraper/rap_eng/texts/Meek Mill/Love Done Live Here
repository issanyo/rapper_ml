*chorus*
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy, love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
Heart colder then chicago, middle of december cause my life is like a slideshow
Fast as its coming as fast as its going, my friends & the women like my money just blowin'
In the wind damn thought they was rollin till the end
My mama told me them niggas wasn't rollin up again
So its blood over water, family over a friend
Too much water will drown ya, that blood flows thru your skin
That blood flows from your heart told me go for the start
And if you turn off my lights i bet i glow in the dark
I bet you i shine bright, bright as a prom night
Them youngin's they tryna murder them niggas ain't tryna fight
Cause mama was never there father they never met, so love dont live there
They shooting or better yet, they scheming instead of dreamin, murkin instead of workin
They locking them in them prisons but really those youngings hurting now
*chorus*
Just a vacancy, love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
"you wanna take care of that buisness? you wanna smoke oh really? since your punk as daddy you ain't got the heart to put in the work
"spent 10 years of prison for puttin in work"
Shawty 16 fuckin everything moving, got raped by her stepdad he told her just do it
No job tellin the pussy to get to it
Drinking and smoking anything to get thru it
And love dont live there, struggling she been there
She ain't got no heart shawty like the tin-man
Sell her anything she won't feel it like its thin air
She done heard everything you could drop a pin there, and shed prolly hear it
Lookin in the mirror, staring at her reflection and it scares her
Everytime that she crys feeels like nobody hear it
Devil ALL in the air hes wispering hes there, she hear him
Everybody frontin on her like shes rosa parks, tryna push her in the back where it was dark
Shes like a goldfish they got her swimmin with the sharks
A year later found her murdered lying in the park
*chorus*
Just a vacancy, love don't live here anymore
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
"philadelphia police are still trying to piece together the death of teenage girl found partially clothed in fairmount park
Today action news reporter karina nova said following developments he joins us at police headquarters tonight with the very latest"
*chorus*
You abandoned me, love don't live here anymore
Just a vacancy, love don't live here anymore
