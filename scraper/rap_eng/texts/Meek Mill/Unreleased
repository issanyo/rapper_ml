I'm back on my shit, man
They tell me, 'Be humble and cop the SL'
Shout out my bitches that answer my call
When I call to collect cause they got me through hell
Shout out that judge that denied me my bail
He made me smarter and made me go harder
They locked me up, then slowed my album up
But I did not give up cause I knew...

Difference between me and most of these rappers
I'm talkin' 'bout work that I really put in
Talkin' 'bout pencils I put on my hip
And I'm talkin' 'bout foreigns I really could whip

And these bitches I really did hit, twenty wit' shows
Came up from nothin' and...

Make a movie on your bitch, tell her friend to get a role
You thought she was innocent
We laughin' like, 'She done been a ho'

Touchdown wit' the two, bring her virgin
Give her that dick long, she bustin' like they...

[Snippet 6]
And, yeah, I been losin' touch wit' my family, it ain't the same
I should have gave my sister some money, but I made it rain
I should have hit the crib wit' my son and played the game
But instead I ended up at the jeweler to make a chain
This is sayin', sayin' when you make money, it make you change

[Snippet 7]
And these niggas get to talkin' like they know me
Finna turn me to the old me
Should've listened to my mama when she told me
Now these bitches throwin' pussy cause they owe me

Nigga, I got the juice when they hop out the coupe

[Snippet 8]
When they fuck wit' you, don't take my picture, nigga
Pops was on the corner, wit' a .40 on my hip, Godzilla
Where's gettin' to it when they hit my nigga, Dean
'Less the shit got realer
Eyes on the South Side, really outside, got guns, got killers

Pussy, and just cause you got a Bentley
That Bentley don't make you thorough
Pussy, still hatin' in front of my city
I'm thankin' this day, for real
'Pussies' could sound like I says, 'Kill'
You comin' like Navy Seals
Just wait to my mama, I promised her Jordans

[Snippet 12]
They killed Chinx Drug in his own city
They killed Lil' Snupe in his own city
Wonder why I don't be in my own city
I don't know if niggas gon' clap for me or gon' kill me
Still livin' lavish and they wonder why I act savage
All these guns are automatics
