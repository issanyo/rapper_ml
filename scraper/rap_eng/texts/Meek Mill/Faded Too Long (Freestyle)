[Intro]
See when I do joints like this
I do it for the youngin' in the ghetto
That ..never hear story ‘cause he gonna make it to tell you
See you know what’s crazy
I want to court all the day the DA say she hate me
How you gonna hate me when me and Lu just took twenty racks
And put coast on them kids back
It’s 30 degrees outside

[Verse]
Twenty-four how could I ask for more
I got my deal it's getting real I'm making cash for sure
Stuntin every chance I get because I had it poor
But every time I go to sleep I hear the devil at my door
And I'm on them papers so them courts I'm going back and forth
Dealing with probation man they all said I'll be back for sure
Mommies turn to zombies from that raw because it's crack galore
You wonder why them babies running crazy steady clapping off
Getting life before they get pussy
Cuz ain't nobody love 'em so they lives get tooken
Locked in cages have 'em fighting over cookies
And lunch trays, just happy them days ain't never kill me
Yea I remember, it was a hot December
Niggas dieing top of winter cuz them kids need them toys
But Santa Claus don't see the boys or see them girls around here
There's jack boys downstairs
No man with the big bag just man with the big gat
Tryna take his shit back cuz he feel the world owe him
And his daughter want a Barbie bike for Christmas
He gon show her
That the love is there, no mother there
Just her and little brother there
We wash our pain with Belvedere
And use the drugs they brung us here
We get high to get by, hot dogs no rib eyes
Where tears drip from red eyes
Where ends don't meet the deadlines
The D.A. said she hate me but I don't understand
When I just rocked a show in front of fifty thousand fans
I think that bitch racist she probably in The Klan
She take her pain out on me but she probably need a man
I took my mom from public housing, put her in the sticks
We came a long way from welfare and getting W.I.C
That shit just made me hungry and now we getting rich
And all these niggas getting sick
I know they wanna get me hit cuz I'm ballin
Yea, cuz I'm ballin

[Outro]
That bitch say she hate me I felt some type of way about that
Last night we just came out giving three hundred pay
She was just at the schools to the girls and the boys basketball teams
Why you hate me, you hate me ‘cause i’m doing and i’m supposed to
And i’m making more money than you
But bitch you can hate me for that
Let’s get it
