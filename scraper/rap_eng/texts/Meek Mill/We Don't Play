[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)
No we don't play that, no we don't no we don't play that
We creep low on these haters we see them its homicide
That chopper get to rocking approach them the hollows fly

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Death to all Po
Green grass roses, from where the summer nights can get the coldest
When them goons come out you pussies getting nervous
But they know somebody about to get murdered, you heard me
All black mini mac whole fifty
Four pound spin a nigga around like he dizzy
I look a nigga square in his eye see if he strizzy
If he ain't walk up on him snatch his life like gimme
Its going to be a murder if I get the word of
Niggas talking reckless about me
I show up to your crib Glock Rugar [?]
Niggas aiming at your head trying to catch a first degree
Blat!

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)

[Verse 2: Chinko]
I don' even have to trap I shoot the dice off
Day a nigga ask get cracked that's a fact
I keep this forty under the bed one in the head
Ready to go letting them know don't bring it here
You got a problem with ok we can handle that
Never been scared I've been prepared for the combat
Let them attack watch them counter react
Like an animal ain't too many niggas that can handle you
They thinking that its bullet proof but I don't think they bullet proof
Let's see how bullet proof you are when I put this bullet through your roof
Cal 40 barking like a Rottweil
Howling at the moon I'm a goon I be outside

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Y'all ready
This it we rolling
You know what I mean
About to get the fuck out of here man
Had to do a little damage
Hold y'all down to Flamers 3
I know I came a little late
But this just the warm up
You know what I mean
You know how the basketball players come out and they just shooting around
Dunking and shit
Doing layups, this the warm up
Get ready for Flamers 3 nigga
October 20th
Is you niggas hating cause you mad or is you mad cause you hating
Flamers!
