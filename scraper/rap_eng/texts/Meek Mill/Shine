[Hook]
Wasn't for this music, I'd prolly be dead
Instead I'm on top and I'm countin' this bread
Sittin' in the mansion, could've been in the feds
Drop top even with a price on my head, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine, only a matter of time
It's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah

[Verse 1]
I was born poor, but I'ma die rich
Ridin’ in the 7 like I’m Pac in '96
Still rockin’ with the clique I had to grind with
Went to war, flip nickels and sold them dimes with
Yea, I used to sell nicks of reggie, nigga
I get the chills every time that Liv confetti hit us
North Philly skinny bull but I'm heavy, nigga
They switched sides they was never with us
And petty niggas wanna mention my name to get acknowledged
Hoppin' that we act like a fool and give them violence
I'd rather kill 'em all with success and give 'em knowledge
Then throw it all away for a sucker 'cause we the hottest
My momma crib big as a church, I'm bein' modest
No sleep, puttin' in work, that's how she got it
'Bout it, 'bout it, I started grindin' when niggas doubted
Now I got it, I'm drippin' in diamonds, a nigga shinin'
That's gangsta

No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah

[Verse 2]
Out in Hollywood trying not to get caught up in it
Struggle was brought up in it, hustle, we gonna get it
This one is for my youngins going to school with corner niggas
Don't get caught up in that boxing corner, nigga
Times changed, it's feeling like live niggas verse corny niggas
They building more jails, I'm warning niggas, shots fire
Momma crying, traumatizing they mourning, niggas
Them cops killing us like it's war with niggas, it's on with niggas
I did shed so many tears at that corner store
Man I spent so many years at that corner store
I see my niggas disappear at that corner store
When they was sleepin' we was there at that corner store
Yeah, and we was eating at the corner store
Coppers catch us and they beat us at that corner store
Shit, we was toting on them heaters at that corner store
'Cause they was plotting, tryna leave us at that corner store

No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah

[Verse 3]
It's no roof so they can see me shine
Whole city came out just to see me rhyme
Started off in Impalas, now it's DB9
In the Aston like he James Bond, who he think he is?
Diamonds dancing all on me, doing the stanky leg
I hear them whispers, niggas talkin' what they think he made
Think what you want, you gon' think I'm paid
Should he be ballin'? I don't think he's safe
All I did was think and pray, I got young niggas in the grave
They got murdered by a nigga with some bitter ways
They don't give a fuck about us, put us in a cage
Let us out with that parole, man, this shit a maze
RIP to Snupe, RIP to Scooter
RIP to Dex, told him not to be a shooter
I tell Snupe, "They don't love ya, they just want to do ya"
You see that truck? That's the feds watchin', not an Uber

No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah
It's no roof so they can see me shine
No roof so they can see me shine
Only a matter of time, it's dedicated, put it all to the grind
It's no roof so they can see me shine, woah
