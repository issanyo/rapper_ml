[Hook:??]
Aye so if you talking about me then you talking bout money
Don't even throw my name if you ain't talking about hunnids
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
If you ain't really know me know I'm a hundred mile running
Looking for the top stop ya its the way a nigga gunning
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)
I do me so do you (I gotta get it I gotta get it)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Look I do me hommie do you
If real recognize real nigga who you
I'm in that new Camero every time I swoop trough
Looking all black everything on them 22's
All them niggas say I'm hot and all them hoes say I'm cool
Cause I be getting to the money and my swagger through the roof
Got that hater looking funny doesn't matter what they do
But if they say they getting money tell them niggas show the proof
Now if you talking about this then we talking about that
We ain't talking about shit if we ain't talking about stacks
We ain't talking about bitches nigga pardon my [?]
Money is the motivation hear it all in my raps

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I ain't got to do me I just let your girl it
Put my dick all in her mouth you hear about it you a loser
Ha ha I said youngin' bout his paper
Getting to the money like mahfuck a hater
My Glock on ya my block on
I pull up in the six you know the top gone
Look like a spotlight I put my watch on
We making movies bitch got get your popcorn
I don't give a fuck what you heard about me
Bet you heard I get money I'm a certified G
I'm a north side nigga but you know that I be
On the south side with my niggas getting to the money

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Bad bitches big money know I live that
I woke up early in the morning where the bread at
Hollywood to MIA you know I did that
And when it come to Philly nigga know I is that
I'm getting money I'm paid
Look at them niggas throwing shade
Huh I'm getting money I'm paid
Look at them niggas hating throwing shade
I do me, do you

I do me, do you
I gotta get it gotta get it gotta get it I'm gone
