[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Cuban Linx and kilos, we might get the rico
Pull up on a sucka, take his bitch like I was Deebo
Got the .45 in the 6, call it Cee-Lo
Buyin' bottles with your cop money, nacho cheese Dorito (hol up!)
All of my niggas official as fuck
Big ass Mulsanne like I'm whippin' the truck
I'm sippin' Ciroc while I'm sittin' with Puff
And talkin' 'bout business with Jigga at lunch
That's cray, that's cray, new toys, lets play
I brought Spades, with the Dusse, like poof, let's trade
I must say, I get money, fuck ho, don't pay
And I ball, in the clutch, Ray Al, for that tre
And I ride, for the Ye, West side, Kim K
White girl, through The Bay, my hood, I'm Mac Dre
Bitch, if money talks why you niggas never say shit?
If sky's the limit, why I'm ridin' in a spaceship?
My money talkin' and my Rollie never tickin' niggas
Five pull this TEC, blow the whistle, I'm official nigga


[Chorus: Joyner Lucas & Timbaland]
I'm feeling a way...
Whoa, run it, run it, run it, whoa
This is what we do
Run it, run it, run it, run it, yeah

[Verse 2: Joyner Lucas]
My bitch look like Halle, my bitch look like Kylie
Your bitch don't look happy, none of ya'll hoes can have me
Can't touch me, can't touch this, MC Hammer with the swaggy
Can't cuff me, can't function, bitch, I don't want to get married
They ain't ever want me on payroll, they ain't ever want me have say-so
Always had a crush on J-Lo, thought I was the man 'til my chain broke
I was so broke can't change clothes, you don't keep it real, you a lame-o
You don't make a move 'til I say so, when I get loose, anythin' goes
Money in the motherfuckin' mattress
They was tryna take it, but I need to get away
I think I'm trippin' 'cause a nigga never had it
I never had a way, I think I struggled every day
Talkin' to God, I'm hopin' he could do some magic
Hopin' to get paid and then take all my stress away
And I could finally buy a motherfuckin' mansion
Then move my friends in, and get Benzs
'Cause this shit sound like sci-fi, I ain't ever had no wifi
I grew up where the guns went- (pow pow), almost got killed in a drive-by
Stay in your biz, don't mind mines, I'm in your top five's top five
Can't touch this nigga, why try? Gimme yo shit or you might die

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, wait, hold up, yo, look

[Verse 3: Joyner Lucas]
Your shit sound like bubble gum, popcorn, Starburst, chocolate, gum drop
Cupcake, milkshake, [?], candy cane, rainbow
Your shit sound like summer time, playground, third grade
Ice cream, fun pop
Reese's, Hershey's, swirly, lemonade, mango
Momma thought I was retarded, Daddy thought I was lethargic
They said I wasn't the smartest, Grammy knew I was an artist
All of y'all niggas is trash, go throw your shit in the garbage
I threw your shit in the ocean, I hope it swim with the starfish
I remember when you wouldn't fuck with me
Ain't nobody wanna ride the bus with me
Ain't nobody wanna share lunch with me
Family couldn't keep in touch with me
Now they all can't get enough of me
Now they want to fly with me in luxury
Same hoes never want to let me hit
Now they all want to bust nuts for me
Name another nigga poppin' than me?
I never been cocky, but they don't want a problem with me
And fuck all these haters that wanna take a dollar from me
Nigga fuck any rapper, yo I don't need a counter with me
Ain't nobody wasn't lookin' for me, they was hidin' from me
All of them was countin' me out, now they countin' on me
I'm so motherfuckin' hot that the wind is a sauna to me
Right before I pull the trigger and beggin' that God forgive me, I said

[Chorus: Joyner Lucas]
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, run it, whoa
Run it, run it, wait, hold up, look
