[Verse 1]
No I don’t treat you like you famous (And you like it better)
I keep it cool and keep you nameless (Say my name)
You like to keep private relations (Keep it on the low)
Just tell me where you want to take it (How far you tryna go?)
You and I sharing locations (Loned up)
On an island in the caymans (Phones off)
I got you smiling in the cayman (Zoned out)
You come to me for your escaping
(Baby)

[Hook]
When it's nights like this, I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there
When it's nights like this, I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there (Take you, take you there)
(Oh)

[Verse 2]
You pull up head tied, chilling with no make up on
Late night, we up on the FDR drive
Got the water on the side
And water running down your thighs
Got me running through your mind
I be chilling and I think that’s why you fell in love
Don’t try to impress you and I know that’s what’s impressing ya
Crazy cause my regular don’t make me regular
And my regular got you blowing up my cellular
And I won’t lie and say sex ain’t on my mind
But baby more time I’m tryna see what’s on your mind
Baby whole time I wonder how you lived
You life
How’d you make your mind
And how you’d end up in mine yeah

[Chorus]
You feel the vibe, it's contagious
Look in your eyes, shit is dangerous
Grateful I had all the patience
I know you going through some changes
(You going through it right now)
You taking pictures, know your angles(Oh)
(But you ain’t holding back still)
No we ain’t perfect but we damn close
(Come here let’s get a little closer)
You give me something I can't pay for
(You precious babe)
That’s why I hold you how I hold ya

[Hook]
When it's nights like this, I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there
(Take you, take you there) (Oh)
When it's nights like this, I really wanna be right here
I really wanna take you there
(Oh)
