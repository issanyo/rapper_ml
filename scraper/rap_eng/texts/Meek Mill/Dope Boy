[Intro: Meek Mill]
(Cuff your chick)
You heard that
They call me Meek Milly aka Mr. Philadelphia
And as my nigga Big Re would say
If you don't like it kill your fucking self nigga

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I got my first eight ball and I went bananas
Cause I started flipping like them little mini cameras
Turned that to a quarter turned a quarter into a half
Somebody tell them niggas with them bricks up on their ass
First time I seen them whip it was my nigga Smooch
When I was broke he used to tell me go and get the loot
Niggas ain't riding they pussy cause they pick and choose
Hit you in your head you go in shock just like you're Pikachu
I see you chasing around them bitches trying to fit the [?]
That's why I'm at the dealer now trying to pick the coupe
Cause y'all was at the club and I was at the trap
Shit I was patient wasn't rushing like no running back
Shit I was waiting cause I had that money coming back
Put them youngins out there with that work and they was running back
Ya I'm like what you know about it
Ask them niggas about me in my hood they know I'm about it
I got it
Selling anything to make a profit
Hustle like a muhfucking nigga in the projects
Money on my mind and my muhfucking conscience
Cause I'm going to get it nigga tell me if you with it nigga

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)
I'm a dope boy I do dope boy shit
All these karats in my bezel that's a dope boy wrist
I can turn a one into a two that's my dope boy trick
See that bad bitch standing there that's my dope boy bitch

[Verse 2: Mel Love]
Six on your head shot
All these niggas sleeping on me about to get their bed rocked
All these niggas creeping on me about to get your egg shot
Gun his ass down and his ass until his head pop
Compact [?] with a ladder and a red dot
Slide up on them niggas ask them niggas what their bread bout
Nigga where that bread at
Make them niggas cash out
Soon as them niggas pass off we back off and stamp out
I mean I be on a cash route
Get it on a fast route
Get it then we mash out
Ask me what my past bout
Big twenties the pass out
Fucking with them bitches tipped them brought my whole stash out
I hit my nect up he be like what now
I be like six points he be like touch down
We head hunting you should duck down
Or get bucked down when we bust around

[Hook: Meek Mill] (x2)

[Verse 3: Mike Tucker]
Well I'm the dope boy
Wearing Gucci and that Louie boy
Money up to here but unemployed
Still selling them squares so my pockets getting bigger
"Are you really that nigga that count it?" Yea I'm that nigga
I got it if you show it I don't care whoever know it
See my bitch all in the mall and its my money she be blowing
While I back up at the spot got an order for a block
Got to get that shit together cause the money never stop
Got the [?] in handy and I'm about to take a point
He won't even know what's missing I'm the man up in the kitchen
And I got these niggas fishing got their [?] all in they hands
But I got to hit the store cause I need another can
Now I'm in Home Depot about to cop some acetone
And I ain't removing paint I'm about to put you on
Told my cousin bring the press I'm about to make it stretch
Show you how to get that money that's a dope boy at his best
