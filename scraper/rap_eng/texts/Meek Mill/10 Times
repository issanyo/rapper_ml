[Intro: Tory Lanez]
I mean this time, like everythin' is swavey
Innit bruh, everythin' is swaved out
Swavey jean jackets, swave Adidas track shoes
Swave everythin', Canada

[Verse 1: Tory Lanez]
My down chick never had a father
But now she call me daddy, he don't have to bother
Her ass big, my stacks larger
Girl, come and get this money that's your last offer
Model in the whip, look like Olive Wine
Kiss me when I holler, you miss out on guap
Women wanna plug 'em 'cause I'm in the game
Stop playin' with that brains, I ain't into games
Me, I'm in the women and I'm spendin' change
I pay for the girl if that chick a dame
Lemme take a second, one, two
My bitches rare, make 'em wear 'em, one, two
Say my name, say my name, what you want, nigga?
It's a party, where the women? We don't want niggas
I'm O ballin', like I'm O'Neill
Talkin' slick, I'll make them niggas eat the whole meal

[Chrous: Tory Lanez]
Gettin' brain in the whip bumpin' N Rhymes
Bad women, I hit  about ten times
Hit the J with the friend from the westside
Bad women, I hit about ten times
How you do that?
Talkin' to the money, yeah I do that
Say how you do that?
Your women love me, yeah I knew that

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
I say, 100k, I blew that, they like how you do that?
We up in the building, nigge, where the fuck is you at?
Steppin' out the G4, where my parachute at?
Louboutins sneakers is so bloody, where my shoe at?
'Cause I got 'em red bottoms, nigga you ain't got 'em
Swizzy in designer, I'm so swavey when I rock 'em
I'm lookin' like a million cash, but better yet, my stash
If a nigga owe me money, I'ma take it out his ass
Ten bad bitches, fuck 'em ten times
You either gettin' it or hatin', it's a thin line
Hope you gettin' yours 'cause I'm gettin' mine
I rock this Audemaur, ain't never set the time
Pretty women and they all tens
I be swingin' 9 like I'm golfin'
Jumpin' out the water like a dolphin
At king of diamonds store, throw money and we all in

[Chrous: Tory Lanez]
Gettin' brain in the whip bumpin' N Rhymes
Bad women, I hit  about ten times
Hit the J with the friend from the westside
Bad women, I hit about ten times
How you do that?
Talkin' to the money, yeah I do that
Say how you do that?
Your women love me, yeah I knew that

[Verse 3: Tory Lanez]
I'm livin' large for a young nigga, my bad
I'm livin' large 'cause my fun's bigger
I'm gettin' green like a drug dealer
If you ask me, I say, "Fuck niggas"
I'm on my own, I'm all alone
I took her from the club and never brought her home
Don't tell your daddy, leave his daughter home
'Fore that nigga look and see his daughter gone
I make 'em hotter than an iron four
Say you hit my chick, why is you lyin' for?
Don't even get him play, why is you tryin' for?
She want the scream and I'm a dinosaur
And it's 24 hours 'til that offer gone
Spend 20 thou', shoulda left it all at home
I ain't trippin', I'ma make some more
Squad full off sweet women, I'ma make you smart

[Chrous: Tory Lanez]
Gettin' brain in the whip bumpin' N Rhymes
Bad women, I hit  about ten times
Hit the J with the friend from the westside
Bad women, I hit about ten times
How you do that?
Talkin' to the money, yeah I do that
Say how you do that?
Your women love me, yeah I knew that

[Outro: Tory Lanez]
Aw yeah bro, I mean my BlackBerry about to die. I wrote all my swavey talk in it on the notepad on there. Ayo Jae, pass my charger. Yeah we good. Green tee with the honey and gin thing, nigga. Full glasses of Nuvo for the new hoes. Can't fit 2 hoes in my 2 door. Baby girl, I'm sorry. Jordans on my feet, what number are these? I don't know, I just bough 'em from Flight Club. We was out there, Jae Fresco on that thing live. 100% swavey, ain't nothin' less than the best. Team swavey. Oh I fly with the Fresco only and that's the no H in the hate, know they diggin'. I talk swave but I French kiss, baby. Oh and um, last but definitely not least, Canada
