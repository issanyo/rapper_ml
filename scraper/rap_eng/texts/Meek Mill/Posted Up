Watching the money move wa-watching the money move

Watching the money move watching watching the money move
Posted up on the posted posted up on the block
Watching the money move

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I say I'm from North Philly where we take opportunity
Low down dirty shame niggas it was cool to be
Haters want to catch me while I'm sleeping Freddy Kruger me
Watch my every move I tell the Google me, usually
I be down S.P. kicking it like Jet Li
[?] he be floating off that water like a jet ski
Bitches heard I fuck with T.I.P [?]
The sames hoes that fronted they regret me
Yes we, posted in the kitchen trying to whip a whole brick up
Butter have your neighborhood jumping like a hiccup
I ain't here to hand out the whole weight like a pick up
That's why my neck froze like its a stick up
And I'm watching for them narcos, posted up like Marlo
Glizzy on the tire of the car though cause y'all know
Niggas trying to creep, thinking that it'll be sweet
You throwing something at 'em and caution covering the streets

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
On the block with that Yao Ming like the Rockets
Quarter bird take it to the table that's a profit
Hating ass neighbors see us [?] call the cops then
I tell my young nigga take it to the alley we ain't stoppin'
The fiends keep copping, the green gon' pile in
Worry about a dope sale, why you ain't trying to stop the violence
We ain't going nowhere, we outchea grinding
Do my thing pull strings like I'm a violin
First and the Fifth be on that strip
Twenty-four/seven trying to make that flip
That's when I saw all kind of shit
Way back before I signed with TIP
I was on that grinding shit
Not a rapper though but a trapper though
Trap house got a drive-thru, call it cop-your-crack-and-go
What you asking for no sticks and seeds
Purple or that sour dies
Keep that yolo by the key my block hotter than hollow-steam
All you do is holler scream and I can get you all that dawg
My block'll sell it Taco Bell how you want it hard or soft
