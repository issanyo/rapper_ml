[Intro]
You know there are people in this world who don't have to put up with all this shit
Like that guy that invented the pet rock
You see, that's what you have to do
You have to use your mind and come up with some really great idea like that
And you can make millions, never have to work again
You think the  the pet rock was a really great idea?
Sure, it was. The guy made a million dollars

[Bridge: Chubbie Baby & Meek Mill]

Killer Cam put me on to the rap money
I was outta town gettin' to that trap money
Me and poppa Joe eatin' that's a fact money
How you think my pockets got fat money
Three pots on the stove, yeah kill the house
Moving birds, yeah the same house you living now
Back then seven 45s tinted out
Team [??] well, have flex [??] it out
Fast forward to the Wrairth, now I got a bigger safe
Same plan, different squad, eatin' off the dinner plates
Sprintin' with the stash box, up and down the inter state
What you think we get it for?
Young niggas gonna get it from the bottom
