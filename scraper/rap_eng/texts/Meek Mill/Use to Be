[Intro: Jordanne]
Yeah (oh-oh)
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus: Jordanne & Meek Mill]
I used to be a used-to (Used-to, used-to, used-to)
I used to be a used-to (I used to be a used-to)
I used to grind in the dirt
I used to cry to 'til it hurt (Oh-ho-ho)
I will look up to the heavens
When is my time gonna come?
I used to be a used-to
But I never got used to
Being what I used to be (Yeah, yeah)
Said I used to be a used-to (Yeah)
But I never got use to (Never)
Being what I use to (Yeah) be (Uh!)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I was never used to niggas that was used to...
Being broke so I started selling coke (Coke, coke)
Times got hard, was selling soap
Scheming just like the preacher in church; he selling hope (Hope)
Now I'm getting older, heart getting colder
Looking at my son while his head lay on my shoulder
Thinking in my head, "Will I make it to see him grow up?
Or will I catch a bullet from something these niggas throwing?"
Trying to take me out, in the hood trying to make it out (Out)
Niggas plotting on me cops all staking out
Trying to get a couple bricks so I can make a house
Close friends hating on me, really tryna play me out
Damn, but niggas couldn't deal with me
If they had blackjack, my shooters would still hit them
North side of Philly where it's real gritty
And dirty at, where everyday they murder at

[Chorus: Jordanne]
I used to be a used-to (Used-to, used-to, used-to)
I used to be a used-to (I used to be a used-to)
I used to grind in the dirt
I used to cry to 'til it hurt (Oh-ho-ho)
I will look up to the heavens
When is my time gonna come?
I used to be a used-to
But I never got used to
Being what I used to be (Yeah, yeah)
Said I used to be a used-to (Hey)
But I never got use to
Being what I use to (Yeah) be

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Yeah, when I was young, I started planning it out
My daddy got killed; I was the man of the house
By the age of 16, man, them hammers was out
So when niggas trying to hit me, I'm just handing them out
Cause I ain't trying to see my mom crying (Crying)
And my sis mourning (Mourning)
So I'ma let this little Mac 11 rip on them
Louboutin sneaks, watch the blood drip on them
For all the times I bled, the tears I shed
Every time I made money, it was here, I said
And if my niggas asked for it, it was "Yeah," I said
Selling butter just to get the fam bread, I spread
I got married to the streets and it was here I wed
'Cause I was never used to being what I used to
Started off walking now the Rolls Royce a coup too
I'ma let the top down every time I shoot through
To give them motivation, even though I know they hating

[Chorus: Jordanne]
I used to be a used-to (Used-to, used-to, used-to)
I used to be a used-to (I used to be a used-to)
I used to grind in the dirt
I used to cry to 'til it hurt (Oh-ho-ho)
I will look up to the heavens
When is my time gonna come?
I used to be a used-to
But I never got used to
Being what I used to be (Yeah, yeah)
Said I used to be a used-to
But I never got use to
Being what I use to (Yeah) be

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
The man with the gold makes the rules
And one who makes the rules break the rules
Some niggas make it alive, some make the news
It's either family or money; I hate to choose
'Cause you need money just to feed the fam
The family keep you cool
Got a nigga on the papers; still, I keep the tool
Niggas heard I'm getting money so they creeping through
I keep my hand up on that hammer what's for me to do?
Let these niggas kill me? (Yeah)
Try to line me up so they can rail me?  (Yeah)
I'm just giving you the real me
Started with a dollar now I got it and I'm filthy
Nigga!

[Chorus: Jordanne]
I used to be a used-to (Used-to, used-to, used-to)
I used to be a used-to (I used to be a used-to)
I used to grind in the dirt
I used to cry to 'til it hurt (Oh-ho-ho)
I will look up to the heavens
When is my time gonna come?
I used to be a used-to
But I never got used to
Being what I used to be (Yeah, yeah)
Said I used to be a used-to (Hey)
But I never got use to
Being what I use to (Yeah) be
