[Chorus: Trav]
And I say, please don't kill my high, please don't kill my high
And I say, please don't kill my high, please don't kill my high
They tell me it's the drugs and the money, you better floss
I'ma get the money and fuck it the buzz comes
Lookin' at the Rollie, it tell me it's our time
Mama said grind before you shine
And I say, please don't kill my high, please don't kill my high
And I say, please don't kill my high, please don't kill my high
They tell me it's the drugs and the money, you better floss

I say, please don't kill my high, please don't kill my vibe, ayy
I ain't have a chicken, I got it in two bricks
Told 'em fishscale and told 'em I choose fast
I stay fly, please don't blow my high, phone calls when I ride by
I get high, I fell asleep on a xan
I crashed the five and I jumped in the six
I told my girl I won't do it again
She blew my high so I fucked her off that

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Niggas counted me out, should've counted me in
Messed up the count on a milly, fuck it we count it again
I mixed up that brown with the Phantom and wash it down with the tint
Like don't blow my high, nigga you know know my vibe
I'm with some new bad bitches, yeah two bad bitches
When I got in the building it's like I blew past niggas
Had to jump out the barrel from under the blue crab niggas
That pretty than [?] claiming I hit you last nigga
I got her face down, and her ass up
She gon' fuck a lame nigga, make him get that cash up
She gon' fuck a real nigga, never even ask much
You be pillow talkin' with them bitches with your ass up but I say
Please don't blow my high, please don't blow my high, and I got
Real killers on my side, hit a nigga twenty-four times
If it ain't the money, the bitches, about floss
We gon' get the money, my niggas gon' bust shots
I'm up in the corner and jump out the four door
Lookin' at the Rollie, it's hittin', it's our time

[Chorus: Trav]
And I say, please don't kill my high, please don't kill my high
And I say, please don't kill my high, please don't kill my high
They tell me it's the drugs and the money, you better floss
I'ma get the money and fuck it the buzz comes
Lookin' at the Rollie, it tell me it's our time
