[Verse 1: Meek Mill]

I ain't no killa but don't push me
I look a nigga in his eyes, tell ya if he pussy
Remembering the times the people would overlook me
The bitches would try to play me
My future was looking shady
Wanted to be a star, they lock me behind bars
Try to shatter my dreams, I tell you them times hard
I ain't never give up
I hustled, I grind hard
Put my faith in the Lord
I know I'mma shine hard
I had no choice but to win
But the odds was against me
So I'm rolling through this bitch with my palms on my Semi
My Dad died when I was young so my Mom would defend me
And my sister would protect me
Now the made niggas respect me
Had to learn to be a man, learn to hold my hands
Learn to work that scale, turn the mouses into grams
Learn to stack this money, work for two and feed the fam
Now I'm the best thing since zaf curry on the lamb
I got 30 in my Glock, moving I'm squeezing
Ocean Drive in the drop head like I'm dreaming
Leaning, Addicted to the money, I'm feigning
Shit you wish you saw, I seen it at 23
Skinny nigga, big dreams, lot of pride
Somebody get in the way of that, it's homicide
My heart cold as Omelly heart when his Mama died
Or cold like Tashima & Ta' when my Aunt Rhonda died
Niggas got fat when we starve, It wasn't Ramadan
But sunny days, we ain't need a lot of time
So I'm like Tony Hawk on a skating board, I gotta grind
What I wouldn't do for a dollar sign, I don't know
It ain't bout money nigga I don't go
Shoot him in his head now he's John Doe
Nine on me, Rondo
I turned a fuckin' quarter ounce into a condo
I turned a condo into a fuckin'

[Verse 2: Lou Williams]

They knock the breath out ya boy
Once he got sentenced
And I'm kinda tipsy so I'm spilling family business
At 10 I lost my pops, too many years he been missing
Mum B, mind gone at all time, that shit ridiculous
Bright lights and flights
See what this life will bring to you?
Bitches faming' my name
See what that shit'll bring to you?
The world is ice cold
Poncho, show him what that flame do
9 millimeters for evil, he can aim too
I seen it all befo'
Seen my mama praying
Seen my B forget my name
Seen my brother's walls cave in
Life is but a dream to me
Lately it's a nightmare
Cause it's a war going on and these people don't fight fair
Asking what the feeling like to see my family living right
Proud of myself because my name light up these Philly nights
God, I hope I'm living right and sorry for the tattoos
But if I go tonight, please take care of my nephews

[Verse 3: Mel Love]

I make the song cry
Make it drip, make it tear
Told you niggas from the rip
From the tier every beat
That I get I'mma rip, I'mma tear in pieces
Like deuces I be super sport creeping
I say, I be with the cool kids
Chilling on some cool shit
SRT-8 her like scrapers on some coon shit
I said we move shit
Eat a dick I do's this
They be on that goon shit
We on that Looney Tune shit
But I let that tool spit, air something
Bet I let that tool rip, tear something
Far way back, we head huntin'
We be on that shit for real a head buster
A Southsider, product of my environment, leadbuster
I be in the newest coupe
Blowing on some fruity fruit
Chain look like Juicy Fruit, mixed up Fruity Loops
Ayo where my boys at, squad up, hootie-hoo
Bitch you either out or in the circle like a hula hoop
Bitch I'm on that shit I talk that shit just like an interlude
And I spit that fire and you tire like an inner tube
All these niggas liars
Call me pliers how I'm grippin' dudes
You should see how I be dipping through
I said tell him they don't want this
They can take a drum clip
Candy in the pot or in the package like it's Fun Dip
I be on that real shit, they be on that nut shit
Cookie, pussy boy, bubblegum shit
Bitch made, uh
