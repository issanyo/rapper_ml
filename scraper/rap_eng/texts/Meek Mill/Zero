[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
I Don’t mind, rushing through traffic just to get dinner ready in time
And I, don’t mind, calling when I’m late just to give you peace of mind
And I, don’t mind, you staying out all night long hanging with the guys
But I do mind, when you look me right dead in the eye and you tell me lies

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
You see it pays to tell the truth look at what you had to loose
Should think before you do, did you not know the rules?
You see it pays to tell the truth, feel so sorry for you
You could have had it all, too bad you gotta fall
Now you leave, now you leave with zero Nothing
Now you leave with zero, nada
Now you leave with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth but you didn’t do it
Now you leave with zero, nothing
Now you leave with zero nada
Now you leave with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth

[Verse 2: Keyshia Cole]
Oh why I tried, giving you chances just to get your act right
And I, I tried, everything from praying to getting things
For getting out of line
Those tears I’ve cried, it hurts so deep inside
That almost drained me dry
But now, it’s time, for you to man up cause I’m taking back what’s mine

[Hook: Keyshia Cole]
You see it pays to tell the truth look at what you had to loose
Should think before you do, did you not know the rules?
You see it pays to tell the truth, feel so sorry for you
You could have had it all, too bad you gotta fall
Now you leave, now you leave with zero Nothing
Now you leave with zero, nada
Now you leave with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth but you didn’t do it
Now you leave with zero, nothing
Now you leave with zero nada
Now you leave with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
I lie just to protect you, never to disrespect you
Cause what we have was so 38 special
And it was times that I heard niggas test you
But I ain’t even ask, I was waiting to catch you
But you caught me and everything was on me
It was time to face the music, everything was on key
And them lies sounded good, didn’t it
Now you sick of me, now I’m supposed to leave with zero, is you kidding me?
One minus one equals none
And if you gonna live then you might live with some
But you gonn think about me everytime you see my son
And I’ma think about you everytime I see the sun, in the morning
It’s gonna be times we get caught up in the moment
But don’t turn your back on your man you belong with
Cause if you loose then I loose too
And if you cool then I’m cool too

[Outro: Keyshia Cole]
Now you live, now you live with zero
Nothing, now you live with zero, nothing nada
Now you living with zero
You see it pays to tell the truth but you didn’t do it
Nothing, now you live with zero, nothing
Now you living with zero ,nada
Now you living with zero , nothing
Now you living with zero , nada
You see it pays to tell the truth
