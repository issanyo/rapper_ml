[Verse 1]
Ok, I walk up in this bitch fresher than a motherfucker
Pocket full of money and my sneakers got blood on them
And bitches I ain’t got no love for them
Just a bunch of swagger and a lil bit of drugs for them
Hey hater you can pull the plug on them
Cause my neck be lightin' up just like a bulb on them
Bling bling, pockets on ching ching
You wifing everything you come across, ring king
Damn nigga, you going ham nigga
I fuck your bitch and kick her out like she’s Pam nigga
Oh that’s your main ho? Well what you saying nigga?
She said she you wasn't in the plan nigga
Pockets on bank roll, chain froze
Nigga we don’t even fuck the same hoes
Watching for the coppers in the plain clothes
Cause I’m riding with a chopper in a Range Rove'

[Hook]
I’m rolling, I’m rolling, I’m rolling, I'm rolling
With my nigga Takbar, I’m rolling
Bitch I’m rolling, I’m rolling, I’m rolling, I’m rolling
With this motherfucking 'Rari like it's stolen
And still I'm gon' walk up in this bitch fresher than a motherfucker
Walk up in this bitch fresher than a motherfucker
Pocket full of money and my sneakers got blood on them
And bitches I ain’t got no love for them

[Verse 2]
White girls, going wild
I murder that pussy now I’m on a trial
So wet, I need 4 towels
She sucking dick like she got four mouths
Old ho, she got whore miles
And y’all niggas hating got 4 fouls
Prolly foul out, I prolly wild out
Pull this heat out on you niggas, you'll dime out
Racks, pause on the pork
I be going ham nigga I don’t need a fork
Ball so hard nigga I don’t need a court
Purple label everything nigga I don’t need a horse
I’m swagged out, maxed out
Bad bitch with me and her ass out
Rack up, rack out
And every time I’m in the building I’ma cash out

[Hook]

[Outro]
I got a bitch in the Bay, I got a bitch in the A
I got a bitch down in Philly that do whatever I say
I got a bitch in New York, I got a bitch MIA
I got a bitch down in Houston she wanna fuck e'ryday
And I be rolling, and she be rolling
She be fucking with the mollies really rolling
And I ain't fucking with the pills but I be rolling
It's ya nigga Meek Mill in this bitch and I'm...
