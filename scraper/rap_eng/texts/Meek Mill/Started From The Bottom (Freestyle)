[Verse 1]
Started from the bottom now we here
We were sellin’ things, pullin' strings - puppeteer
Started with a dollar now I’m jumping out the Lear
All my niggas behind me, you can find me in the air
In the car smokin’ loud on my way to Mr. Chow’s
I say: “ain’t it funny now, nigga, this bracelet’s fifty thou”
He say he gon’ hit me, how? I keep shooters all around me
Quicker-picker-up your bitch, that pussy wet and I be Bounty
I got all these haters frontin’ just from lookin’ at my pictures
Plottin’ on my Instagram, they wanna follow me like Twitter
On my way home…
But I’mma hit her, did I mention, 30 grand’ll get you gone
You’ll come up missing ‘cause my cake long
Where your real friends at?
Hold up, fuck that, nigga, where your girlfriend at?
She probably in the VIP where all her girlfriends at
She know that you be hatin’ on me and I still hit that, damn
You gon’ need a green card for the Cuban link (ouch)
Cancel my account, I’ll probably move the bank
When you see them hammers out you’d best not move a blink
FN57, fuck around, shoot through a tank
Bitch, shake that ass, go on, shake them titties
Bitch, shake that ass like you work at Magic City
I be bustin’ bottles, ain’t talkin’ ‘bout with Drizzy
Probably be with OVO and I be in Toronto city
With yo fake ass, and yo fake weed
Frontin’ on a real nigga, bitch say cheese
And put your flash on just to catch the AP
Diamonds thunderin’ all in that bitch, I call it KD
Hold up – hold up, wait a minute, y’all thought I was finished?
I popped twenty bottles, that was just a scrimmage
Nigga, you ain’t ballin’, you pop twenty and you finished
Got you fuckin’ up your re-up every time we in the building
‘Cause we started from the bottom now we here
Sippin’ Rosé with Rozay and it’s Belaire
I signed with MMG and did it in a year
I started with a circle and I turned it to a square, ya dig?
