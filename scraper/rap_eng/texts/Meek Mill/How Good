[Verse 1: Dave Patten]
Beautiful beautiful beautiful, beautiful beautiful beautiful
All I'm saying is you could run away with me so we can be together
On a tiny little island hanging out on the beach, yeah we'll remember this forever

[Hook]
I didn't know how good good good it would be
Until I got here now I never want to la la leave
On a tiny little island hanging out on the beach
It's you and me and me and you all summer

[Verse 2: Dave Patten]
This is my first time I've never done this before, I've got a 747 ticket locking up the door
I got a backpack full of stuff I probably won't need, we're meeting at the airport a quarter to three
Philly international I wave goodbye, for the next few weeks I'll be living the life
Didn't know if it was worth it but I'm finally here, what was wrong with me boss, sing a long with me ya'll

[Hook] x2
I didn't know how good good good it would be
Until I got here now I never want to la la leave
On a tiny little island hanging out on the beach
It's you and me and me and you all summer

[Verse 3: Meek Mills]
Miami beach, Collins Ave
Watching the Lamborghini's and Ferrari's pass
Sipping mojitos, 'Tron margaritas
Posted on the strip, we like the parking meters
I'm wasted, she wasted too
I love being wasted and the things it make us do
She calling me baby, I'm like let's make a few
And after this we at Cabo and to Jamaica too
Living the life, living it nice
If you living with me, then we living it right

[Hook] x2
I didn't know how good good good it would be
Until I got here now I never want to la la leave
On a tiny little island hanging out on the beach
It's you and me and me and you all summer

X3
I diddn't know how good good
I diddn't how how good good good
I diddn't know how good good good it would... be
