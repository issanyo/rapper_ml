Go head and blame it on me, We ain't going to blame it on you
We ain't going to blame it on late night ringing on you
We ain't going to blame it on that, we ain't going to aim on you
Said you would never cheat what a shame on you.Times you thinking I'm sleep, shit you thinking I'm sweet
Got your phone on silent all vibrating the sheets.When they took me to jail, thought you was waiting on me
Messing with the same old lames that was all hating on me.All that shit you said all them lies you told
All that shit you did, those fake dreams you sold.It don't take rocket scientist to figure why I'm so cold
Got a ice box in my chest , girl my heart on froze
