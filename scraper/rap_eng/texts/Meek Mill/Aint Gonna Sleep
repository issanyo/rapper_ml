[Intro]
I had that little bad bitch with me the other night
She gon ask me why I don't ever go to sleep cause I was up
You know what I told that ho

[Bridge]
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
Bitches know its money when we step up in the building
Neck is saying cool but my wrist is saying chillin'
Stuntin' so hard I could hurt a hater feeling

[Verse 1]
Grind hard then you shine hard that's the motto
Shitting on these niggas like I fucking hit the lotto
Who you know fresh from out the hood to a Gallardo
House up on the hill stupid crazy dumb retardo
Y'all know, either going home or going hard doe
You only live once and I'm a ball until I fall ho
[?] all that hatting shit ain't even called for
We just pull up on you haters looking like a car show
Made a hundred grand and I blew it
Made another hundred grand and I ran through it
Every time I get it spend it like its nothing to it
If I see it and I like I'm like Nike I just do it
I just cop it I just drop it [?]
Gucci Louis Polo [?]
Breitling Rollie Audemar
Fuck it I want all of it
Kobe though I'm balling bitch
Competition calling quick
Addicted to the money I guess I'm a cake-a-holic then

[Bridge]

[Hook]
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich (you heard me ho)
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich (what did you tell that ho?)
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich
All them bitches know its money when we step up in this bitch

[Verse 2]
They say ain't nothing coming to a sleeper but a dream
And I ain't been to sleep since I was fucking seveteen
Money that you've never seen
Graveyard shifting it
Late night getting it
All about the Benjamins
Break the work down let the Pyrex heat up
Hit my youngins off to count the money with my feet up
Let them sleep we up, hating nigga D up
Hustlers hear this shit then bring it back like its the re-up
I ain't going to sleep until I touch a hundred million
They talking about no homicide I say that I'm a kill them
Talking about that blow paper money to the ceiling
Bitch I'm about my mula give a fuck about your feelings
Chill then, ain't no time for cuddling and kissing
Just hustling and [?]
You tired just like Michelin
I be up like all night counting my percentages
Trapping all day and serving fiends like this was tennis here

[Bridge + Hook]

[Verse 3]
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich like porter
Stared with a dollar turned that to four quarters
I hustle like I got three sons and four daughters
Watching for the D's dipping in the Ford Taurus
I'm porridge, flaming hot
You hating if you say I'm not
I buy that shit you say you got
I hustle I don't play a lot
Dawg I let my swagger do the talking I don't say a lot
Hustle and make it five times back I never save a lot

[Bridge + Hook]

[Outro]
Word up
I ain't going to sleep until I'm rich nigga
How do some of you niggas go to sleep dead broke
I don't understand them
Cause I ain't going to sleep until my bank account on muhfucking seven,eight digits nigga
You already know
