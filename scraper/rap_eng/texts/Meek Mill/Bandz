[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bandz

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Man, I'm in these streets, it's been a long day
'Bout to sign this deal and throw it all away
'Bout to cop the crib that Dame lost today
Funny look at them niggas that slippin'
You trippin', no fear, my niggas, we get it
I'm looking down at the whole world through these glass ceilings
And when I step outside bad bitches with me
Back in my section twisting that la la, can't let it stress me
Wake up, fall asleep to Dizzy Gillespie
Ba-back it up and break it down
She gon' bust it on this dick you gon' take her out of town
I put ice in my veneers, I put rubies in my crown
Count them stacks and blow them racks, niggas know who they around

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bandz

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Okay, I walk in this bitch I fuck shit up then I leave, ho
Pay your car note or get some money for that weed, ho
45 hundred, blow it, there go double C's, ho
Might go throw a birkin bag if you tell me please, ho
She gon' throw that ass back, drop that on them real niggas
I'm gon' throw that cash back, drop that on the real bitches
Murder on that pussy, ho, I feel like I kill bitches
You gon' get like every bag and every shoe if I deal with you
Young nigga ballin' like I fuckin' hit the lottery
You just want the money shorty, you ain't got to lie to me
All these niggas hatin' on me, know they wanna body me
Cause every time you see a nigga, I look like a robbery

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bandz

[Interlude: Travis Scott]
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz

[Verse 3: Travis Scott]
Lately, I been goin' crazy
Laughin', drinkin', find myself in arms of different women, huh
Toast it, I need to use my cerebellum
Tried to tell ‘em cut that rap shit all that wack shit is underwhelming
Time's ticking, palms itching
Minds tripping, tired of living, mad decisions, I'll kill ‘em
(Ooooh, I know you bitch niggas hate me now)
I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz, I got bandz

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Don't need these hoes, hundred racks to blow
Nigga, I got bandz (Oh no, oh no, goddamn)
Let's get this dough, run the world for sure
I got bandz
