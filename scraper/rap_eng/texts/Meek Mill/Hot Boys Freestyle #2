[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
North Philly where I be at
All black Dickie hoodie on and my P hat
[?] trying to see behind the tint I tell them we that
Maserati with the auto start where the key
Where the key at, I don't know
It ain't money I don't go
You got money I got money the difference is mine show

How real is this
Chilling in the cut higher than a Louis tag
When the biddies see me I remind them of a Gucci bag
Cause they want me and they need me
I'm like Seymour, feed me
I'm getting money believe me
Hoes want to pop the kid cause I'm on T.V
