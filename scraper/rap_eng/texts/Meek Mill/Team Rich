[Intro]
Yeah, mmm, turn the beat up a lil' bit
Yeah, it should never be one nigga that's the head of the crew
'Cause if that one nigga go to jail, fall, die or somethin', everybody falls
We live by this shit
If you got money, you fall, it gon' catch you
When the whole team rich

[Chorus]
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper if you fall
I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich

[Verse 1]
Really want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit but it don't mean shit
Look at what Po did to Mitch, hit him up for thirteen bricks
Niggas ain't loyal, these bitches ain't loyal so we never trust 'em
I lay with that chopper, I sleep with one eye open these niggas'll touch ya
I go to sleep with that MAC on the dresser
Shit, I feel like Tony Montana
Pray we don't go to the slammer
They just got here for a hammer
I'm 'bout to go to Atlanta 'fore I go banana
Payin' these lawyer fees, coppers follow me, watch me, recordin' me
Pussy niggas, they said, they extortin' me
Put a price on my head, try to order me
I'm like, look what this money shit doin' to me
It can make us or break us
I never fake with the fakers
I'm gettin' money, shit, I got your bitch in Jamaica
Dutty whinin', rolling papers
Never minding for your favors
Fuck, it's time we do it major
We been grinding for a minute
Bust a hundred with my niggas
That's the only way I'm living

[Chorus]
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich

[Verse 2]
You know I ride for my dawgs
It's do or die for my dawgs
No switching sides on my dawgs
I done sold nickels and I done flipped dimes with my dawgs
Nigga, it's deep
We do not fall out for bitches 'cause we done fucked all of them bitches
I'm alley-ooping these hoes, I get all my assists
You know I'm ball with my niggas (Woo)
Time to get back on that trill shit
Came in the game with some real shit
You came in the game with some bullshit
I turn it on when I wanna hit my kill switch
I make a mill' quick, then I double up
I came from the bottom like a upper-cut
When the feds came, got the bubble-guts
Shit, I pray to god, it ain't one of us
And I pray to god, I don't fuck this up
Bout to make a nigga get a hundred bricks
Passing, blowing shit, probably blow this shit
Shit, they said I can't do a show and shit
They ain't notice it but I'm goin' through it
I never show that shit, I'm immune to it
I should kill these niggas, let my goons do it
I can smell the money, it coming soon to us

[Chorus]
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich, want the whole team rich
Want to see the whole team lit, see the whole team rich
See the whole team rich, want to see the whole team lit
My niggas so hungry, we go get that money and we ball forever
If you got some paper and I got some paper
You fall, I'ma catch ya (I got you my nigga)
Want the whole team rich
