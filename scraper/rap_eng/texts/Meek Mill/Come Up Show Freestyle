[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I'm yelling free my nigga TIP
Brought him from Atlanta to Philly, Mike Vick
Fighting charges lawyers say that they might stick
I was praying to God, man don't do me like this
The girls fucking niggas with the bricks
Now they popping me I laugh dirty bitch

Dirty money new work
Smell it on my new shirt
Lying make these suckas feel good but truth hurt
A lot of niggas do dirt, get it in return
But enough of dirt doing have you sitting with the worms
Bloods dripping tissue burn
Bullets rip your soul up
Hollow tips fucking up your head like a bowl cut
When my hommies roll up they be like hold up
But I be like fuck that cause I do enough rap
I ain't with the talking tell 'em spark 'em like a blunt wrap
Rather make these suckas bow down like a blunt
Twist them like a Backwood, black laid black hood
Dicked down ski'd up
Hoes down G's up
I couldn't get no Gucci, but I could get an Oozie
Spray up your hood and hit your neighbors just for being nosy
Truthfully, I don't be all on that gun shit
I be on some Puerto Rico chilling with a young chick
You niggas on that dumb shit
My niggas got them birds and come and get a drumstick
I am cooked crack to the [?]
All this rapping got me shining like aluminum foil
Your niggas ain't loyal
Money, envy, and greed will destroy you
All over a dollar sign
Meek Milly I am Columbine
And I'm hotter than these suckers like a thousand times
