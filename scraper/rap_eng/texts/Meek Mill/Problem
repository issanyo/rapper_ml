[Intro: 2Pac]
Static, it's gon' be, it's gon' be static for sure
Cause what, what the rap audience ain't ready for is a real person
You know what I wanna say, a real N-I-G-G-A
I'm coming out, I'm 100% real
I ain't compromising nothing
Anybody that talk about me got problems
So, anybody that try to take away the Chasers' money as a whole, they got a problem
We gon' suffocate

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Fresh off the boat, it ain't no stretch on the coat
We made that money, that money don't make us
We finna go get it like it was the first
And niggas is hurt, they say it's a drought and these bitches is thirsty
Then they make an excuse
Cause we still up and lit like it's Sunday at church
Blowing a roll, I got it back, I was down in the O
All around us, the gold
Niggas say that they hot like the top of the stove
Bloody down to my toes, Christian Louboutin
Look how I switch that new designer, I made my bitches Saint Laurenta
Hold up, welcome home to Chapo, glad to see you back out
Since you been on lockdown, we been in the crack drop
But now the prices back down, we up in the trap house
Yeah, bout to blow the money like a scammer
Tell them bitches that I'm going hammer

[Hook: Tdot Illdude]
It's looking like we got a problem now
It's looking like we got a problem now
It's looking like we got a problem now
It's looking like we got a problem now
We put in that work and y'all calling now
We put in that work and y'all calling now
It's looking like we got a problem now
It's looking like we got a problem now

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Uh, pour up the dirty and load up the thirty, so we can go put in some work
Be with them killers and hang with the hitters, you mention my name and get put on the shirt
We get the car, we hitting your block
Bend on that bitch, throw that shit in reverse
Jump out the van with the drum on the Glock
Chasing them down, if you trip, you get murked
Woo, whipping the white with the soda
Fucking them over I'm fucking with Hova
I jump out the Phantom, I'm sipping the Fanta
I bought that new Bentley, and I flooded the Rollie
All of these niggas know me, all of these bitches, they know I'm O.G
Come to my city, you know we O.D
Toting, I see me no rolling on me
She got all this ass out, I got all this cash out
I'm a fuck your girl like I love her in my glass house
She gon' cut you off, nigga, I tell her to never fuck you raw, nigga
Put a sign on that pussy

[Hook: Tdot Illdude]
It's looking like we got a problem now
It's looking like we got a problem now
It's looking like we got a problem now
It's looking like we got a problem now
We put in that work and y'all calling now
We put in that work and y'all calling now
It's looking like we got a problem now
It's looking like we got a problem now
