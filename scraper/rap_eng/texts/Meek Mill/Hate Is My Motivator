[Intro: Meek Mill]
Hating is a weak emotion
A sign of failure

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Nigga stop your hating, get off your ass
Worrying about the next nigga, that’ll cost your ass
Go get on your grind nigga and off the pad
Slow grind until the top, but you’re falling fast

You can hate on me
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Hate on me I volunteer
Lowest points, man I been there
Locked up on the toppest tier
Trying to get up out of there
This the home where failure from
Future I’ll fly up out of here
Some of us gonna make it, homie
Some niggas gonna die in here
Yea, but ain’t no hate gonna get you out of here
Niggas hating on me, I approach them dudes without a fear
Hating niggas never prosper, hating gotta stop you there
Niggas that made it to the top, start hating then got dropped from there
Yea, get the money nigga, why hate?
No time for hating, only money on my mind stay
Shit I ain’t with it if it can’t go on my mom's plate
Hating is the leading cause of killings and the crime rate
Yea, they my motivators though
I be smiling in they face even while I know they hating though
Every chance I see I’m ‘a take because I know what they waiting for
They waiting on the day I fall, but hate won’t work at all

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Nigga stop your hating, get off your ass
Worrying about the next nigga, that’ll cost your ass
Go get on your grind nigga and off the pad
Slow grind up to the top, but you’re falling fast

You can hate on me
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Lebron ain’t make it to the NBA from hating
He made it from dedication, ambition and motivation
Addition to what they saying
Niggas voicing opinions
Them niggas can only judge me the judgment day of my ending
They judge me from the beginning
Hate it though, but it’s cool though
They giving gas to my engine, adding fire to fuel
I’m flyer than all these dudes
They see it that’s why they hate
I’m grinding because I’m shining, they grinding ‘cause they at state
I’m grinding because I’ve gotta, my bills they gotta get paid
And Tweety, he gotta eat, he wore Pradas like every day
My momma live in the hood and they chopping whichever way
Ain’t no hating gonna solve my problems so why would I even hate?
I’m gonna get it
That’s word to Robby, and my Aunt Terry
Some of my homies haters, that’s why I keep them near me
And when they hating on me, it feel like they cheering
Haters is my motivator, hate on me, I dare them

[Hook: Meek Mill]
Nigga stop your hating, get off your ass
Worrying about the next nigga, that’ll cost your ass
Go get on your grind nigga, and off the pad
Slow grind until the top, but you’re falling fast

You can hate on me
Hate is my motivator
Boyyy

[Outro: Meek Mill]
Hating is a weak emotion, sign of failure
Puffin on that purple, same color as Donatello
That hating gonna lead to your demise I’m trying to tell you, son
