[Intro: DJ Khaled & Meek Mill]
This the takeover, Ivy
Meek Milly, DJ Khaled
Let's go

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
I've seen good girls turn bad, for the love of that cash
Used to ride Impala and now 200 all on my dash
And I done came up so fast, shorty came up too
Put her on my team and we fucked the game up too
Now my good girl, my bad bitch, I came up, ain't have shit
Them Porsches and horses, a new horse and carriage
I'm married to the paper, strong bond can't break us
Your girlfriend said this and that
But they want to diss so they hate us, shawty

[Hook: Just Ivy]
You know you missing my love, missing, missing my love
But you know you missed out
No more good girl, bad girl takeover
Play good with me, baby I'm a soldier
No more good girl, bad girl takeover
No more good girl, it's a bad girl takeover

[Verse 2: Just Ivy]
[?] take my love even on the run
And I'm going on, baby I'm so dumb
Dumbest thing like the girls that have no fun
Tried to regroup for ya, you were the only one

[Hook]

[Interlude: DJ Khaled & just Ivy]
No love, get money, yeah, get money
It was all good 'till I had my heart stolen
Can't fall for the [?]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
And don't get caught up in the hype, caught up in the lights
I taught you how to ride, daddy daughter with a bike
Yeah, you was by my side from the morning 'till the night
Through all the ups and downs you left and we was on to something right
And they say when a good girl gone, she gone forever
And you like a lost homie, I should mourn forever
Through the storm whatever, rain, sleet, hail, snow
And I just wanna stick together, me and you Velcro, go

[Bridge: Just Ivy]
No more good girl, bad girl takeover
Play good with me, baby I'm a soldier
No more good girl, bad girl takeover
No more good girl, it's a bad girl takeover

[Verse 4: Just Ivy]
Why when it's all over, you wanna get back
I guess it's always like that
How to keep up, that he has to leave her

[Hook]
