[Intro: Meek Mill]
R.I.P to all the young niggas that couldn't make it here
Ain't no love in the summertime

[Hook: All Steezy]
I'm kinda hot right now
I think I'll let the clock wind down
We must've hit the finish line, cause
Ain't no love in the summertime (x7)

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ain't no love in the summertime
Where young niggas dying for a pair of number nine
Jordans, They got it scorching on the other side
Ever see a nigga get murdered and see his mother cry
Prolly one of the reasons I never cried
Trying to ball for a hundred summers and never die
Last time I seen my daddy I had to tell him bye
Rolling down in the ground mama couldn't tell me why
So I was on the corner all them late nights
Young nigga out there swimming with the great whites
Cops always shining on me like a stage light
It wasn't no time for stage fright
Niggas busting, medics rushing clearing the scene
Young niggas was dying boy I pray its never my team
So we out here strapping
Before this rapping I was trapping
I'm talking middle of summer when niggas get put in caskets oh!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil' Snupe]
My momma had me young and my daddy he was gone to the pen
So I grew up thuggin' with my friends chasing ends
Hopefully sit in a Benz
Rapping just what I live swear its no need to pretend
I been outchea long, daddy he was gone
And what's crazy about that I don't know when he coming home
But that don't stop shit I still be in my fucking zone
I've been the king of this shit give me my motherfucking throne
Nigga If I could go back I wouldn't rewind shit
I started taking over niggas got behind quick
Then friends started switching, bitches start acting different
But I can't get off my mission guess its just my ambition

[Hook]
